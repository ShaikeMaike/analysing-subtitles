Oh, dear, ...oh, dear.
- Good night, officer.
- Good night, sir.
Evening, dear.
Whoa, whoa.
Thank you.
He's so charming and elegant.
He has such wonderful taste.
Yes, he has, when it comes to models.
Now I shan't be seeing you again.
Of course you will.
Just because the statue is finished...
...that is not a reason why things shouldn't stay as they are.
But I shan't be posing for you anymore.
Surely we are past the stage where we need an excuse to meet.
We have but what about other people?
Have you...
Are you going to tell them about us?
Let's not think of other people, hm?
Let's think of ourselves.
Excuse me a moment.
Janine.
This is a surprise indeed.
- How are you, Georges?
- I'm fine.
And you look wonderful.
Thank you.
Oh, Georges, this is Dr Pierre Gerard.
- Georges Bonner.
- How do you do?
How do you do?
- Janine, it's getting late.
- Oh, no, we've plenty of time.
Pierre and I are on our way to the theatre.
I heard you had a reception here tonight so I asked him to bring me along first.
I'm glad you did.
I was just about to show a few friends my latest sculpture.
Please.
Georges.
This isn't my statue you're unveiling, is it?
No.
Did you ever start it?
No, I'm afraid
I left the sketches in Italy.
Shall we go?
I'm glad Mademoiselle Dubois brought you along, Doctor.
Oh, thank you. I've always wanted to see the inside of your place, Bonner.
- It has quite a reputation.
- A good one, I trust.
Very. Tell me, how many patients can you accommodate at one time?
Oh, not more than 15.
I have the house next to this one, which I use as the clinic.
There is room for more...
...but I find that the patients I get...
...require a great deal of individual attention.
- Difficult cases?
- Difficult people.
Their money gives them an overblown sense of their own importance.
- Yes, I've met them.
- Yes, I'm sure you have.
But now I think it really is time that we...
Excuse me.
- Well?
- No sign of him, sir.
I waited till all the passengers were gone.
He just wasn't there.
- What time is the next train?
- In about six hours, sir.
All right.
Make sure you meet it.
Yes, sir.
I am extremely sorry to have kept you waiting.
I would like to say at this stage...
...that any credit due for what you are about to see...
...should be laid at the feet of my charming young model.
An artist cannot form a thing of beauty...
...unless he has a thing of beauty from which to draw his inspiration.
And now there is nothing else for me to do...
...except to throw myself on your mercy.
- A most wonderful likeness.
- Yes, isn't it?
Oh, Dr Bonner.
But it's...
- It's...
- A very fine piece of work, Bonner.
- Thank you very much.
- It's extremely beautiful.
You wouldn't be interested in selling it, I suppose?
You can see I still have to cast it.
Anyway, sculpting is something I do for my own pleasure.
Having not yet reached the perfection I seek,
...I find it quite impossible to give up the completed work,
...so I'll keep it.
- Oh? Where?
- Oh, not here.
Somewhere I can go occasionally to look at it and...
...be reminded of my beautiful young model.
- Are you feeling all right?
- Yes, yes, of course.
It's just that I think we ought to go, Pierre.
- Would you mind getting my cloak?
- Yes, of course.
Erm... a remarkably fine sculptor,
Bonner, don't you think?
Yes, very fine.
I wanted to buy it but he wasn't interested.
Says he always keeps his stuff when he's finished.
- Really?
- Yes.
I wonder where...
Hello! What's this?
I thought there'd be something else here somewhere.
Mm, a torso. Oh, yes!
Oh, yes, a very beautiful woman she must have...
Terribly sorry.
Very clumsy of me.
Your cloak, Janine.
Thank you, Pierre.
You are leaving?
We are already late for the theatre.
I hope you have a very pleasant evening.
Yes? What is it, Roger?
It's half past six, sir.
Already? Are you sure?
- Yes, sir. I've checked with two clocks.
- My watch says ten past.
It must be slow, sir.
The time is definitely half past six.
I need a new watch.
I need absolute accuracy.
Good bye.
I am afraid I must ask you to leave now.
You all know that my main duty is the care of my patients.
Their needs must come before everything else.
I would like to thank you all for coming here...
...and...
...and I must apologise if I seem rude...
...by bringing this party to so...
...to so sudden a close.
Strange fellow, Bonner.
Did you know him well when you were in Italy?
- Why?
- Oh, I don't know.
It was just that he didn't seem too anxious to see you again.
Yes, it did seem that way, didn't it?
Well, apparently it doesn't worry you very much.
No.
No, it doesn't.
Oh, it was beautiful, Dr Bonner, but beautiful.
- Thank you very much.
- Good night.
If you change your mind about selling any of your stuff, do let me know.
Good night. It has been my pleasure,
I assure you.
What time is it?
- It's a quarter to seven, sir.
- Thank you.
Tell Roger, if he has any news for me when he gets back from meeting the train...
...he can come and wake me.
- Whatever the time is.
- Very good, sir.
- Good night.
- Good night, sir.
- I thought you had gone.
- I want to talk to you.
- Nobody knows I'm here.
- I'm sorry but you must go.
But I must talk to you, Georges.
Not now, later.
- I'm very busy.
- Not later, now.
I want to know what's going to happen to us, Georges.
Look, Margo, I'll talk to you tomorrow.
It's Janine Dubois, isn't it?
You're in love with her.
- Please leave.
- I'm not leaving.
If you think you can just forget me you're mistaken.
I won't let you.
You can't!
You know I love you.
You made me tell it to you time and time again.
You made me humiliate myself.
I'm not going to step aside so you can be with someone else.
Get out. Get out!
Your eyes.
What's the matter with your eyes?
All right, Georges.
We'll talk about it tomorrow.
Georges?
- I'm sorry.
- Too late.
Too late.
Margo.
I tried to make you go.
I tried...
...very hard.
Wait a moment.
Yes?
Hello, Georges.
I saw the statue last night.
Why did you lie to me?
Why didn't you want me to know that you'd started work on it?
Why did you start work on it?
I like to finish what I start.
Oh. Is that why you ran away from me in Italy?
Is that what you call finishing what you start?
My holiday was over.
I came back to work.
- So suddenly?
- Yes, so suddenly.
There was a case.
It was urgent.
I waited for you to come back to me.
I waited for you to write to me.
Then I realised that if I ever wanted to see you again...
...I had to be the one to make the first move.
Why? Why are you so afraid of loving me, Georges?
I watched you towards the end of the holiday in Italy...
...and you were like a man heading towards something...
...which he wanted to avoid.
I began to think that I'd won...
...and that you were going to admit to yourself that you really loved me.
Was I right?
All right, Janine.
I did fall in love with you in Italy.
This could not be so I left.
- Why couldn't it be?
- It just couldn't.
- But you knew how I felt about you?
- Yes, I knew.
And you still ran away from it.
I'm not going to give up so easily, Georges.
Oh, tell me you don't want me to give up.
No, I don't...
Oh, I knew I was right.
May I see your statue again?
Yes.
Yes, of course.
It's very lovely.
It's you who are lovely.
I only copied.
Is it finished?
Nearly.
Would you like to pose for me again?
When?
Now.
You still haven't accepted that we love each other.
Yes, I have.
But it doesn't make you happy.
That's because it doesn't alter things.
- What things?
- Oh, the... the impossibility of the situation.
Come in.
The gentleman's downstairs, sir.
Ludwig!
Oh, please excuse me, Janine.
I have been waiting so long for Ludwig to arrive.
You'll understand.
Ludwig!
Ludwig!
Let me... look at you.
Oh... it is so good to see you.
That's good. You look wonderful.
Just the same. I was worried.
- Worried?
- Because I am late.
I... I knew you... you wouldn't let me down.
You have found the ultimate answer.
Is that it?
Oh, we'll talk about that later, Ludwig.
- Aren't you forgetting something?
- Yes, of course, our little ceremony.
I haven't been too well.
It has affected my memory also, I think.
Ah, you have not forgotten how to live.
What is the point of what one is doing...
...if you don't enjoy life, what it offers?
What is the point, as you say?
The...
The usual toast.
- Ludwig, your hand.
- Oh, yes, my hand.
- Let me have a look at it.
- No, it's not necessary.
I had a stroke.
That is why I was not here sooner.
It has left me with this legacy.
- Why didn't you let me know?
- I was frightened to.
I hoped you would have found the answer by now.
- You have not found it, Georges?
- No.
No, I haven't found the answer.
The operation is still necessary.
I cannot do it.
- With your left hand.
- No.
We must find someone else.
- But that is not possible.
- Well, try.
We always knew if we didn't find the ultimate solution...
...there would have to be another surgeon someday.
- The stroke might have killed me.
- But it didn't.
Three weeks I have been waiting,
Ludwig.
Three weeks!
I have been taking this fluid every six hours now.
Six?
It is what keeps me alive.
So you see, you must operate.
You... you know what will happen if you don't.
Yes, I know. You will die.
You're old. You can see death staring you in the face.
But I can't... I'm not going to die.
Then you must find someone else...
...to do the operation.
But who?
Who can we get?
We need a young surgeon, that's all.
Just a surgeon.
We tell him just enough to satisfy him...
...and I'll be with him all the time he's doing the operation.
That's the best way, Georges.
For the first time I'll be with him to show him what to do.
Next time, if you still need the operation,
...I shan't be here.
I'll be dead.
Find someone else? Huh.
It's easy to say.
- There is so little time.
- You are a doctor.
You must have met other doctors, someone who will do it.
Mademoiselle Dubois is leaving, sir.
Janine.
I'm terribly sorry, Janine.
Let me introduce you to my oldest and dearest friend,
...Ludwig Weiss.
Ludwig, this is
Mademoiselle Janine Dubois.
It is delightful to meet you, my dear.
How do you do, Professor?
I'm sure that you have a lot to talk to the professor about...
...so I'll say goodbye.
- Goodbye, my dear.
- I'll see you at dinner.
Janine, why not bring
Gerard along this evening?
- Pierre?
- Yes.
Yes, tell him Professor Weiss of Vienna is here.
I'm sure he would love to meet him.
I thought we were going to be on our own tonight.
Ludwig is here only for a few days.
We'll have so much time together.
Oh, Georges, you don't know what it means to me...
...to see you again.
It means everything to me.
This Monsieur Pierre, is he a doctor?
Even better, a surgeon.
And... do you think he'll do it?
If he's convinced that you give the operation your blessing,
...then he'll do it.
Why should he be influenced by what I do?
Ludwig...
Ludwig, you're still the same.
You just cannot accept the fact that you are a great man.
One of the greatest in your own field.
There is no medical man in the world...
...who would miss the chance of meeting you,
...let alone work with you.
Half of what makes up this reputation belongs to you, more than half.
You and I know that.
No one else does.
Listen, Georges.
Why not tell them?
Publish our findings.
Please, Ludwig, allow me to decide when to publish.
Probably you are right.
You have invested more in this than I have.
Yes, indeed.
Nevertheless,
...I probably shan't be here to see the consequences.
I am tired, Georges.
As you said just now,
I can see death staring me in the face.
I'm sorry, Ludwig.
Believe me,
I didn't mean it that way.
Strange, getting old.
One suddenly has no future to look forward to...
...and is forced to look back and...
...survey the past.
Do you remember our original toast,
...the first time we knew we had succeeded?
Of course I do.
Say it.
- For humanity.
- That's right.
For humanity.
Not for me, not for you, Georges, but for all.
I know what it means.
Do you, Georges?
Sometimes I wonder a little.
You have changed so much since we have started.
That is hardly surprising.
I'm talking about our original ideas,
...bright, shining ideas,
...full of hope for a brave new world.
What happened to them?
Where did they get lost?
Why...
Why do you say they are lost?
I think they are.
The years have brought me an added insight...
...that enables me to see more clearly...
- ...the fact...
- Wait a minute, Ludwig.
You are forgetting something, aren't you?
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
- Do you still have that photograph?
- Photo... photograph?
- Our photograph.
- Ah, yes, of course.
- Give it to me.
- Mm...
Look at it, Ludwig.
And what do you see there?
I see the two of us.
- As we were at the beginning.
- Exactly.
So, remember,
...when you talk of this wisdom...
...and this insight that old age has brought to you,
...remember I too have this wisdom and this insight.
- How old are you?
Have another look.
Let it remind you,
...while you have the wisdom that comes with a life of 89 years,
...I have that...
...which comes with a life of...
Yes, sir, I know what you're saying is possible...
...but it's not proven.
Proven!
If we doctors waited until something is proven...
...before we moved,
...there'd be no patients left.
They'd all be dead.
Look, I have seen it done in three different ways,
...none of them completely effective.
- The first is to make an ingress through...
- Ludwig.
Just a moment, Georges.
An ingress through...
Ludwig, why not take Dr Gerard down to the study?
- It will be so much easier down there.
- Yes, of course.
Come on. Come on, Dr Gerard.
- You'll excuse us?
- Oh, of course they will.
Come on.
I'll get pencil and paper to show you what I am talking about.
You know, the incision must be made directly...
Pierre seems very interested in your Professor Weiss.
Yes, I told you he would gladly come...
...once you mentioned
Professor Weiss of Vienna.
He's a wonderful old man.
Have you known him long?
All my life.
We... used to work together.
Along time ago.
That makes you sound very old.
Janine, I can't tell you how much it means to me to have you back.
I missed you so much.
You needn't have. You know that.
Yes.
Yes, I knew.
Georges, you still haven't told me...
...why you tried to avoid falling in love with me.
You started telling me something this morning but you never finished it.
Because I had to go away.
Because I have to go away again.
Go away? Where?
Where is not important.
What matters is that I shall have to leave Paris very soon.
But you'll come back?
No.
Why?
I can't, that's all.
You can't just stand there and tell me you're going away and never coming back...
...without giving me an explanation.
My work makes it necessary.
Because you're a doctor?
Yes, partly.
I have to travel where no one has ever been before.
I want to lift the curtain of life and see what lies beyond.
To do this it is necessary for me to go away.
Is it necessary for you to go alone?
All right, you've convinced me but it's not something I'd care to try.
Ah, you lack the spirit of the pioneer, Dr Gerard.
Being a surgeon is a practical business.
It's necessary to make a living.
It doesn't leave much time for pioneering.
But if you had the opportunity of becoming one of the pioneers...
...by performing one simple operation,
...what would you say then, huh?
First I'd say that no operation is simple.
Then I'd want to know what this operation involved.
If it were impossible to explain it, if you were asked to leave it on trust?
Then I should have to say no.
Regardless of who was talking to you?
Professor Weiss, when we started this conversation...
...I was under the impression that we were speaking hypothetically.
Are we?
No.
We are not.
I see.
I suppose I should be annoyed at this verbal subterfuge.
I don't know why I'm not, really.
Look, suppose you tell me just exactly what it was you asked me here for.
See this?
My right hand.
The one I would have used if I were going to operate.
I came here for one single reason.
To save the life of Georges Bonner.
- What?
- Yes.
By performing an operation that only I know how to perform.
You see? I can't do it.
Therefore, I am asking you to take my place.
This operation, Dr Weiss,
...what exactly does it involve?
In spite of what you said, this one is really simple.
It involves the removal of the uter-parathyroid gland.
I thought you said this was to save Bonner's life.
I haven't finished.
To remove the gland and substitute an alternative.
An alternative? Why?
Is it necessary to know the reason just to perform an operation?
Physically, no, but morally, I think so.
Would you be prepared to leave the protection of your morals...
...in my hands?
I...
I'm not sure.
Look at it this way.
I am asking you to perform a very simple, straightforward operation...
...and I am guaranteeing to you...
...there can be no ill effects.
On the contrary,
...unless this operation is done,
...and very soon,
...Georges Bonner...
...will die.
I agree that the operation is simple.
I wouldn't exactly call it straightforward.
- It's never been done before.
- Actually, I've done it myself many times.
You've done it?
There are no moral or legal aspects involved.
I suppose not, as long as the patient is willing.
He is willing.
- You will be there yourself all the time?
- I will.
And will you lend your name to this?
Very well, I'll do it.
Good.
Now, come on.
I'll show you what's to be done.
Thank you.
This is Georges Bonner's laboratory,
...where we will do the operation.
Wouldn't it be better in a theatre next door to the clinic?
No, no, it's better here.
We don't want people to know the doctor is sick.
It's bad for the morale of the patients.
That's a fine piece of work, isn't it?
Oh, Georges, I love you so much.
And I love you.
I've tried not to.
I've tried very hard.
Is it so bad now you've given up the struggle?
I don't think I could have let you go.
I'm not going to let you, ever.
Georges,
Dr Gerard must go now.
Yes, coming, Ludwig.
It's late.
I think you'd better let
Gerard take you home.
Whatever you say, Georges.
It's been a very great honour to meet you.
My colleagues will be most impressed.
Please, Dr Gerard, I must ask you not to mention our meeting.
You see, I am old and tired.
If the medical fraternity knew I was here,
...they would request lectures, addressed meetings.
Oh, you understand of course.
As you wish.
I'm sorry about this, Bonner, but I have to go back to the hospital.
- Thank you for coming.
- Not at all.
- Will you see me home first, Pierre?
- Yes, of course.
- Dr Bonner, please.
- Yes?
I am Inspector Legris of the Sûreté.
I wonder if I could have a word with you.
Of course, Inspector. Come in.
Thank you.
- Evening, Mademoiselle, Messieurs.
- Evening.
- We were just on our way...
- I shan't belong.
Don't leave on my account.
Oh, we can wait a few more moments, can't we, Pierre?
- Come into the study, Inspector.
- Thank you.
- Sit down, please.
- Thank you.
What can I do for you, Inspector?
Just a couple of questions, sir.
Routine.
Relating to what?
Relating to the apparent disappearance of a young lady, one Margo Philippe.
Did you say Margo?
But that's impossible.
- You do know the young lady, then?
- Oh, yes. Yes, of course I do.
- When did you last see her?
- Yesterday.
I had a small reception here and she was the guest of honour.
You... you met her here, didn't you?
Oh, yes, the young lady you modelled.
Yes.
Did you see her leave?
I think so.
Why, yes. Yes, I'm sure I did.
What's happened to her, Inspector?
Well, we don't know, sir.
She has just disappeared.
It seems the last time she was seen was here at your reception.
But that's terrible.
What could have happened?
Quite a number of things could have happened, Mademoiselle,
...and it's up to me to find out the one that did.
This statue you did of her, could I see it?
- Why?
- I understand it's an excellent likeness.
As I have never seen the young lady...
...it would help me in my investigations if I knew what she looked like.
I...
I'm afraid, Inspector,
I no longer have the statue.
But I just...
Yes, Monsieur?
You were going to say?
Nothing, nothing at all.
It doesn't matter.
Perhaps you can tell me who does have it.
Nobody.
A stupid accident this morning.
It was broken.
I was touching up a section of the plinth...
...and I knocked the whole thing over.
I'm afraid it was smashed to pieces.
I see. Most unfortunate.
Well, thank you, Monsieur.
That will be all for the moment.
You will let me know if there's any news?
- I'll let you know.
- Thank you.
- Good night, Inspector.
- Good night, sir.
- And thank you.
- Not at all.
- What could have happened to her?
- You know the statue is in the laboratory?
- Yes. Yes, I do.
- He only wanted to look at it.
He would have wanted to take it away with him.
I know how the police mind works and, I'm afraid, I know myself.
It's probably very silly of me but...
...I simply cannot part with my sculptures.
I see your point.
Well, thank you for the dinner, Bonner.
Janine.
Good night, Professor.
- Good night, Gerard.
- Good night.
- Well?
- He'll do it.
Oh, good.
What happened to the girl?
When is he going to operate?
It is me, Ludwig, who is talking to you, not the policeman.
What happened to her?
What is the matter with you, Ludwig?
I will tell you what's the matter with me.
Ten years ago when I came to London to do the operation...
...a girl you modelled just disappeared and was never seen again.
Ten years before that...
...another of your models just disappeared.
Two could be a coincidence.
Three cannot.
What have you done to her?
You're very tired, Ludwig.
So am I. You should go to bed.
I'm not tired, I'm frightened.
Frightened for you,
...what you might have done.
Good night, Ludwig.
- When is he going to operate?
- Tomorrow morning.
I thought I told you to go to bed.
Are you going to take another dose of the fluid?
You'd better go to bed,
...unless you want to see what happens when the dose is overdue.
I have been examining the gland.
- What about it?
- You tell me.
What is the matter with it?
Oh, don't distress yourself.
It will do what is wanted of it.
- I am not referring to that.
- Then what are you referring to?
This gland is not like the others.
It was taken from a...
...from a living body.
- You're talking nonsense, Ludwig.
- Don't tell me nonsense.
I am not such a senile old fool that I have forgotten the difference between a revitalised and a living organ.
This gland has been taken from a living body.
All right, Ludwig.
As you say,
...it was taken from a living body.
But it was because of you that I had to do it.
Now it's my turn to say "nonsense".
You were due here three weeks ago.
As always, I had a uter-parathyroid ready.
As always, I had removed it and revitalised it, but...
...you didn't arrive.
I managed to keep that gland revitalised for four days.
Then another one.
Four separate glands
I've removed and revitalised,
...only to have them die, and still you didn't arrive.
I just...
I just couldn't get access...
...to any more cadavers.
No.
Oh, no, this...
This was the only answer.
The answer for whom?
For you?
Or for the poor man you have murdered?
But I'm sorry.
It was my fault, wasn't it?
You had to do it because of me.
No, Georges.
I can't see how this can be justified.
You would rather
I had not been able to get a gland at all.
You would rather this was the end.
Is that what you would have liked?
Yes.
It is.
Knowing how it would happen you still say that?
But I'm not afraid of death.
If I were,
I too could have remained young.
Do you remember how we talked about it and you tried to persuade me?
But what is death that it should be feared so much?
You don't know what you're saying.
Of course I know what I am saying.
Why should the death of the other man...
...be of less importance than your own death?
By what right can you decide a thing like this?
This is a thing that only God can decide.
Have you become God all of a sudden,
...to judge that you are more important than the other man?
Of course I'm more important.
He was nothing, nothing at all.
A nonentity.
He had just as much right to life as you have, more perhaps,
...because he didn't attempt to tamper with the progression of life.
While you are on this pedestal of moral indignation...
...you seem to have forgotten that you are as involved as I am.
No.
I do not forget.
That is perhaps because I am so sad.
I am sad for you too.
You have changed so much.
I'll tell you why I have changed.
It's being alone,
...so utterly alone,
...again and again.
Every few years having to sever all contacts, cut all traces.
Having to disappear and start a new life.
You knew this would be the case when you set out.
Knowing something and living with it are...
...are two very different things.
I often think I can't bear it any longer.
Georges?
We have come to a time where we must consider with great care...
...whether what we are doing should continue.
No, let me say what I have to.
No man can live alone all his life.
It's not natural.
It rebels against human nature.
But as long as you continue...
...you must remain alone.
No.
No, there is an answer.
Not to continue.
No, to continue.
But not to continue alone.
Georges, you're not being serious.
Of course I'm serious.
Do you think
I've never thought about it?
This must be the answer.
Georges.
What you are suggesting is monstrous.
But why?
Why is it monstrous to want to be with the person you love, always?
Mademoiselle Janine?
It is she you talk about?
Yes, Janine.
I will not hear of it...
...and I must ask you to promise me now...
...not to consider it again.
I cannot promise that.
Then you are truly alone now.
For I will have nothing more to do with it.
Ludwig.
No, Georges, you mustn't do it.
Don't be stupid, Ludwig.
Give me that key.
Give me that key.
It is past time already.
Yes, Georges, it's been many years past time.
Ludwig, that key, quickly.
All right, I promise.
Now, give me that key.
You're lying.
I can see it in your eyes.
You are lying to save yourself.
Give me that key!
Ludwig.
Look.
Please.
No.
It is better that it end here before further damage is done.
This must be the end.
No, you must...
You mustn't do it.
You fool! This...
- This is all I've got.
- Yes, I know.
And I know it will take you two years to make a fresh supply.
No, no.
No, don't.
Don't do it.
Dr Gerard, sir.
Oh.
- Good morning, Dr Gerard.
- Good morning.
Everything is ready, including the patient.
Where is Dr Weiss?
Oh, I'm afraid he had to leave late last night.
He received an urgent message from his home in Vienna.
He asked me to... to apologise on his behalf.
Monsieur Bonner.
Without Dr Weiss it is out of the question for me to perform this operation.
Last night you agreed.
The Doctor's reputation is such that under his patronage I agreed to do it,
...but if he is not here, it's... it's impossible.
You must or I shall die.
I recommend you to see another doctor.
Wait.
- I'll pay you well.
- That's of no consequence, Monsieur.
If you are in the critical condition that you say you are in,
...I advise you to go to a reputable hospital immediately.
It's possible that they may be able to do for you what I cannot do.
Good day.
Come in.
Inspector Legris to see you, sir.
Oh, yes. Show him in.
Good morning, sir.
- I hope you'll forgive this intrusion.
- Morning.
- Please sit down.
- Thank you.
- What can I do for you?
- This is a little difficult, sir.
Are you a particular friend of Monsieur Georges Bonner?
No, I'm not.
I only met him for the first time the day before yesterday.
Then there's not much you can tell me about him.
No.
When we met last night
I received the impression...
...that you wanted to say something.
Yes, that's quite correct, Inspector.
Remember that statue that he said was broken?
Well, he didn't break it.
It's in his laboratory.
That's strange.
I take it you haven't managed to find the girl yet.
No, sir, we haven't.
And you think Bonner knows something that will help you?
I don't know what to think.
The deeper I get into this case,
...the more complicated and unreasonable it becomes.
Unreasonable, Inspector?
How old would you say
Monsieur Bonner was?
- About 35.
- Yes, that's what I would have said.
Why do you ask that?
Look, sir,
...I need your help,
I don't mind admitting it.
- To find this girl?
- No, it goes deeper than that.
Far deeper.
I'm going to tell you something...
...and then perhaps you may be able to give me the help that I need.
Please do.
Ten years ago in London...
...a young woman disappeared,
...later presumed to have been murdered.
That's not very interesting, you'll say.
It happens all the time.
Well, exactly ten years before that...
...the same thing happened in San Francisco...
...and ten years before that, in Bern, Switzerland.
Three completely isolated cases.
Then, two years ago,
...the international files at the
Sûreté were being tabulated.
A fact was noticed that tied these three disappearances together...
...and pointed towards them all having been perpetrated by one man.
In each case...
...the girl in question had been posing for a statue prior to her disappearance.
In each case the sculptor was a doctor.
And in each case the doctor disappeared shortly after.
All this is carrying coincidence too far.
You see what I'm getting at, don't you, sir?
Yes.
I see what you're trying to get at.
But if Bonner is the man you suspect, sir,
- ...he'd be over 60 by now.
- Yes.
That's where the whole thing becomes unreasonable.
You said yourself that he was about 35, certainly not more than 38,
...and I agree with you.
I assume you haven't said anything to Bonner about this?
What's the point?
These statues of the women who disappeared,
- ...were they ever found?
- No.
That's another peculiarity.
The statues were seen by a small number of close friends of the sculptor...
...and remarkably fine pieces of work they were too by all account.
Then they were never seen again.
How can I help you, Inspector?
Well, as you've met Monsieur Bonner,
...I had hoped that you might be able to give me a lead.
I have checked his background thoroughly.
His movements seem all perfectly normal as far as I can trace back.
And then I reach a complete dead end.
How far back before you reach this dead end?
Ten years.
Look, I think I may be able to give you some sort of lead.
It may not mean anything but it's worth a try.
See what you can find out about Professor Ludwig Weiss.
- You've heard of him, of course?
- Weiss? Vaguely.
- He's a doctor, isn't he?
- He was one of the very greatest.
He was at Bonner's house last night.
You saw him there.
Try to find out if he was in London,
San Francisco and Bern...
...at the time that those girls disappeared.
You don't think Professor Weiss could have been responsible?
No, I don't, not directly.
But you will try?
Dr Gerard, I'll try anything.
Needless to say, you won't say a word about this to anyone, will you?
Naturally not, Inspector, if that is your wish.
Thank you.
I don't know your reasons for wanting me to do this, Monsieur Dumont,
...but whatever they are,
I must decline.
I'm sorry.
But you're not making sense, Pierre.
You come here with a story which you admit is mostly guesswork...
...and you expect me to believe it.
All I'm trying to do is to warn you against Georges Bonner.
I gathered that,
...but you still haven't explained why.
I can't give you all the details until I am sure of them myself.
But... the man's abnormal.
For heaven's sake, Pierre.
Try to talk sense.
Last night Professor Weiss asked me to perform an operation on Bonner.
I agreed, and today
Weiss isn't there anymore.
Well? What's so mysterious about that?
By itself, nothing, but added to other things that I have discovered...
Oh, not that idiotic story about those statues again.
I've never heard anyone talk such nonsense in all my life.
I admit it does sound far-fetched.
That is why I want you to wait...
...until I can get more information.
Spy on him.
That's what you mean, don't you?
You came to make an impression upon me with your story about Georges.
Well, you've done that.
But it was about you and not Georges that you made the impression.
You are jealous of him.
You're jealous of his work and about me.
Well, I love him.
And I'm going to marry him.
It's unusual, Monsieur Dumont.
You will grant me that.
So is the fee I am offering you.
Yes, that's true.
Very well, then. When is it to be?
I, er...
I think I could manage next Tuesday.
It is to be now, tonight, and at my place.
Very well, then.
I'll put my things together.
One needs many instruments for an operation.
What's this?
This is a scalpel, Monsieur Dumont.
You couldn't be expected to know what that is...
...but to us doctors it is the principal instrument,
...like a spade is to a farmer, you know.
And just about as filthy too.
Leave all this.
I have all the equipment you need.
You have? Very well.
I always have a small one before I operate.
My hand is not as steady as it was, you know.
Wait for me.
Oh... Oh, Janine.
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.
I hope you don't mind my coming here like this.
No, of course not.
I was looking for you all afternoon.
- The clinic didn't know where you were.
- I have been busy.
Janine, there is something
I must tell you.
I...
Georges, are you ill?
No, no, of course not.
- Why?
- Oh, it's just that...
Pierre was here earlier this afternoon.
He said something about an operation.
He's got some fantastic story in his mind about you and Professor Weiss.
What sort of story?
Oh, it's too ridiculous for words.
Something to do with glands and statues.
I really didn't know what he was talking about.
Darling?
- Are you sure you're not ill?
- No, of course not.
I'm just tired.
Yes, just tired.
I was so worried about you this afternoon,
...thinking you were ill and not knowing where you were.
- Janine...
- Yes?
- Would you do something for me?
- Anything in the world.
Then come with me.
Georges, what a strange place.
- Is it yours?
- Yes.
There's my statue.
What's it doing here?
I'll...
I'll explain in a minute.
I love you.
But it's simply wonderful.
So many beautiful things.
- It must have taken years to do.
- Yes, yes, a long time.
Wait, I'll... I'll show you something.
This is the very first thing I ever did.
I was 12.
It's charming.
1798? Oh, Georges, you've got the wrong date on this.
If you modelled this when you were 12 then this date makes you... 104.
Georges?
Georges!
Yes, I heard what you said.
I don't believe it.
Whether you believe it or not is of no importance.
It is important that you do this operation.
My answer is the same as before, Bonner. No.
Wait a minute, Gerard.
Listen to me once more.
Then we'll see if you feel the same afterwards.
Weiss and I...
...were fellow students.
I was his senior by 15 years.
- His senior?
- Yes, his senior.
I met him when I returned to university for a refresher course on surgery.
Quite by accident we discovered...
...we were interested in the same line of research.
And then...
...finally we discovered the secret of immortal life.
But we had to prove what up till then had been only theory.
So...
I volunteered to be the first guinea pig.
Since I embarked on this experiment,
...I have never been ill,
...never had a blemish on my skin.
Sickness and disease have passed me by.
So you see,
...not only did we discover the secret of perpetual life,
...but of perpetual health as well.
Then why didn't you publish your findings?
We haven't published because to do so would bring disaster.
The balance of nature is such...
...that the population of the world is kept at a level...
...where the world can adequately provide food and living space for our people.
If it were suddenly made possible...
...for people to remain alive and healthy indefinitely...
...the whole structure of nature would collapse.
Within one generation...
...the population of the earth would be doubled, then quadrupled.
There would be famine on a scale never before dreamed of.
This is one reason we haven't published.
- One reason?
- Yes.
There is another.
Every ten years it is necessary to have the uter-parathyroid replaced.
In order to replace an organ you must first find a replacement.
With no one dying there would be no replacement.
You told me earlier on about a fluid that you have to take to keep alive.
Only in the latter stages of each ten-year cycle.
If, for any reason, the operation is delayed,
...it is possible to remain alive for four weeks...
...by taking this fluid.
Not desirable,
...for it has an unpredictable effect on the mental balance.
And you have none of this fluid left?
Enough to keep me alive for another six hours.
I shall become the inheritor of all my 104 years,
...of all the sickness I have never had,
...of every pain, blemish, disease,
...a lifetime of illness,
...in one moment.
That is why you must perform this operation.
I'm sorry, Bonner, but I still can't do it.
Why not? Tell me why not.
You are asking me to participate in an offence against nature.
You said so yourself.
An offence against God.
Nothing you can say will make me change my mind.
You're in love with Janine, aren't you?
Yes, I am.
You wouldn't like anything to happen to her?
What do you mean?
At this moment
Janine is somewhere only I know.
If you perform this operation and perform it successfully,
...I shall release her.
If you don't perform this operation,
...or if anything should happen to me while you are operating,
...Janine will not be seen by you or anyone else again.
You have two hours to verify the facts.
Then I shall expect you at my house.
Two hours.
Remember.
Here you are, dearie.
Drink it up.
Why? What's the hurry?
No hurry, no hurry at all.
But I'm a working girl, remember.
Time is money after all.
You'll get paid so stop nagging.
Cognac.
I'm sick of waiting here for you to fill your great fat stomach.
- I'm going.
- What are you doing? What about...
What, do you think I'm a girl who can be bought for money?
- I've never been so insulted.
- You said 50 francs.
It isn't safe for a respectable girl to be around on her own.
My escort's here now, anyway.
Mind the dustbins, dear.
Never mind, Roger.
You go to bed.
Yes, sir.
Good evening.
Everything is ready.
Please.
If I perform this operation you will release Janine immediately?
I give you my word.
It will be extremely unfortunate...
...if I don't survive this operation.
No!
No, no!
Drink this.
I am very grateful, Doctor.
You can show your gratitude best by taking me to Janine Dubois.
Of course.
You'll be strong enough to do that by the time I'm ready.
It means nothing to you that you saved me from an extremely horrible death?
Nothing.
Try getting up and moving around a little.
How does it feel?
I said, how does it feel?
- Did you see Bonner go out?
- No. I heard him, though.
- Have you any idea where he went?
- No, sir, I haven't.
Find Inspector
Legris and bring him here.
- Yes, sir.
- And hurry. It's desperately urgent.
- Where have you been?
- Later. Come on.
You said you wanted to be with me.
Always.
- Is that still true?
- Yes.
Yes.
Whatever it may mean?
Whatever it may mean, yes.
Janine,
...I'm going to tell you about myself.
It all started 70 years ago.
Those are Monsieur Bonner's private papers.
Never mind that.
You leave this to me.
Now, then, sir. What's the matter?
Bonner has abducted Janine Dubois.
He's hidden her.
Wait a minute, sir.
Please will you start at the beginning?
Earlier this evening
Bonner came to see me.
He asked me to perform an operation on him.
This has been my... existence.
Not life,
...existence.
Until I met you.
Now you're going to come with me, Janine.
But first you must become exactly as I am.
Think of it.
Never to grow old, always to stay as we are,
...as we are now, never to be ill.
To stay as beautiful as you are now.
- No.
- Always.
Through all time.
And this fluid affected his reason?
For the few moments before taking it he became without reason at all.
Homicidal, completely mad.
That's when he killed those three women.
- And at other times?
- At other times rational, sane,
...charming, intelligent.
Here's a carrier's receipt.
"Unspecified crate, 3x2x2, collect at this address,"
"...deliver to railway arches,
Gare Du Nord."
Today's date.
The statue.
It was here yesterday.
It's gone now.
We must try it.
It's the only clue we've got.
If what you say is correct...
...then he must be all right now that you've performed the operation.
I made the incision but I did not perform the operation.
It will be all right, I promise you.
- No, no!
- Janine!
No!
He didn't.
He didn't do the operation.
He didn't do the operation!
I am going to die.
I am going to die.
- Janine! She's in there.
- What?
Break that door down quickly.
Get out of here.
This is Sand Rock, Arizona, of a late evening in early spring.
It's a nice town, knowing its past and sure of its future as it makes ready for the night and the predictable morning.
The desert blankets the earth, cooling, resting for the fight with tomorrow's sun.
And in my house, near the town, we are also sure of the future.
So very sure.
Mmm. 12:00, sharp.
Trying to get rid of me?
'Cause if you are, it won't do you any good.
Well, I wouldn't want people to talk.
- Let them. They do it anyway.
- Mmm.
You know, I think it must be my money that impresses you.
What money?
Well, I got a check today.
- Johnny, you sold another article!
- Uh-huh.
Got enough to finish the outside of the house.
All the comforts of home.
To think of the time
I wasted living in the city.
It's nice out here.
Question is, would you keep this up if we were married?
Of course not.
As soon as I got your name on the marriage certificate,
I wouldn't have to do it anymore.
Let's go see what the stars have to say.
I already know your horoscope.
You know who the stars say a man born under your sign should marry?
No, who?
Me.
I'm a Scorpio, and a Scorpio always gets along well with a Sagittarius.
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.
What else do they say?
Oh, a Sagittarius is philosophical and very positive.
And has a blithe, happy-go-lucky manner.
Would starve if someone didn't come along to make him a meal occasionally.
And is quite helpless in certain situations.
Come here, look at my stars.
Tell me if they say whether a Sagittarius could support a Scorpio.
"Starlight, star bright
First star I've seen tonight
"I wish I may, I wish I might
"Have the wish I wish tonight"
What was that?
A meteor.
One of the biggest.
- Can you see it?
- Yeah.
Yeah, there it is.
It's by the old Excelsior Mine.
You're crazy.
He's dead serious.
Didn't you even hear it?
I didn't hear nothing until you kept banging on my door.
Look!
Oh, it's beautiful!
Come on, come on, let's go down.
All right, all right, keep your shirt on.
Holy cow!
Brother, that's really something.
It's the biggest thing that's ever happened in our time.
I'm gonna take a closer look.
Oh, be careful, John.
Go ahead, be a hero.
We'll take our chances.
Who said anything about you?
You stay right here.
You look after Pete.
This is where Pete's going to be, right here.
Johnny! Johnny!
Wait a minute. You stay here.
John!
I'm all right, Pete. Down here.
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm all right.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Maybe you'll listen to me next time.
John! John, are you all right?
Johnny? Johnny.
Yeah, I wasn't hurt, Ellen.
Well, then, what's the matter?
There's something down there.
Boy, you're not kidding. A couple of tons of earth that almost hit you.
No, that's not what I mean.
What do you mean?
What was it you saw down there?
I'm not sure.
Some kind of a ship, I think.
- A what?
- A ship.
What kind of a ship?
I don't know.
It's like nothing we've ever seen before.
Look, something must have hit this guy in the head. Come on.
It sounds crazy, but I tell you it was there.
Part of it was still showing.
Look, boy, you've been up in the stars too long.
Now, come on, let's get out of here.
It's like a huge ball, rammed there in the side of the crater.
Look, this is no place to hold a conversation.
Come on, let's go before it starts falling again.
All right, all right.
I'm not crazy, and I'm not imagining.
I tell you, I saw this thing.
Oh, brother.
I saw an open portway.
- So, what was inside?
- Well...
Something. Then the door slammed shut and started the landslide.
That figures. Come on.
- Pete, will you listen to me?
- I did.
I let maniacs drag me off in the middle of the night.
Now, on top of that,
I get rocket ships thrown at me.
Uh-oh.
Here they come to find out what happened.
Oh, please. Don't tell them what you told us.
Ellen, I tell you,
I was close enough to it.
I could have reached out and touched it.
Oh, Johnny, please.
You're not going to tell those people you saw Martians running around down there?
What would you say if I had found a Martian down there?
I'd say, "Hold him for a circus."
I'd say, "Wait and find out what they're doing here, first."
Ellen, you don't believe me, either.
Oh, I don't know.
That's Ellen and Putnam.
There's Pete's 'copter. Hi!
Hey, what's going on?
How long you been up here?
What happened?
- I'll tell you what happened.
- Johnny.
It's a meteor. Johnny says the biggest one that ever hit us.
It must've been.
I felt it clear down to my shoes.
Lit up the sky like the end of all creation.
It was no meteor.
No meteor?
What's the amateur astronomer's point of view?
There's some kind of a ship down there.
A ship?
Don't ask me what kind,
'cause I don't know.
You mean from one of those stars you write about?
Or the kind that Pete, here, operates?
I tell you, the evidence is buried right down there.
This may be the biggest thing that's ever happened.
If you're smart, you'll get this whole area sealed off until we know what we're up against.
You see it, Ellen?
No, but if John says he saw it...
He could be mistaken. You, Pete?
I tell you, from its size and its appearance, this thing came from outer space.
I even have reason to believe that there's some form of life in it.
Must've been traveling pretty fast to hit the Earth that hard and stay in one piece.
That's right.
And even if it was in one piece, would anyone still walk around after a concussion like that?
I'm just asking, Johnny.
I want to make sure
I quote you right for the paper.
I'll take you home, Ellen.
I don't mind, Matt. I'll be all right.
Don't tell me you're going back to Sand Rock.
When Loring gets through printing that statement of yours in his paper, they won't let you walk around out in the open.
Oh, you too, Pete?
We need help, not lecturing.
Come on, Ellen.
Isn't there anyone who would want to help?
What about Dr. Snell at the Wayne Observatory?
You've done a lot of work with him.
Yeah. I'll call him as soon as we get back.
Hey, slow down.
Johnny?
Those fools.
Oh, you can't really blame them.
But I did see it.
I even saw some kind of tracks.
I can't be just imagining it.
Oh, I'm thinking of you, Johnny.
And people talking behind your back and laughing.
Mmm. They've talked about me before.
Even your old friend, the Sheriff.
Matt didn't mean anything by it.
He's known me all my life.
You know how he looks after me.
I don't blame any of them.
Can I prove it? Even to myself?
Well, maybe if we really do find something...
You really have to, Johnny?
I have to, Ellen.
You'd better keep out of it for a while, though.
I wouldn't want them laughing at you.
Look.
What's that?
What was that?
I don't know.
Did you hit it?
I'll see.
Keep the motor running, Johnny, please.
Yeah.
You stay here.
Come on, let's get back.
What is it?
Thought I heard something.
It's just a Joshua tree.
Let's get out of here.
- Did you get any good shots?
- Pretty good.
The crater's about 1,000 yards around.
One of the biggest things that ever happened.
Look how far down it goes.
Sure covers a wide area.
Hey, here comes our stargazer now.
Come on.
Snell's here.
- So are the reporters.
- Uh-oh.
And here they come.
I'll try and steer them off.
- Good morning, John. Ellen.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Missed you out at the house.
Dugan, American Press.
Lober, Press Dispatch.
Gentlemen, this is Miss Fields.
How do you do?
Quite a show you started. Any statement?
Why repeat it? It's all right here.
"Star gazer sees Martians."
Well...
Stick around, I may really have something for you in a few minutes.
Look, this is private. Do you mind?
Not at all.
How about it, Miss Fields?
- You add anything to this?
- No.
- Hiya, Bob.
- Hi.
Well, well, John.
Hello, Dr. Snell. Glad you could get away.
I wouldn't have missed it for anything.
- How long you been here?
- About an hour.
Oh, you've just gotten started then.
Well, hardly. I've seen enough.
But you do believe me?
Look, John, last night you saw a meteor fall to earth.
That much has been substantiated by witnesses.
The presence of the crater itself, its formation and characteristics, all support the theory that it was a meteor.
But I tell you, I saw a ship.
You saw something that looked like a ship.
You can't prove it, John.
I can prove it if I can get you to help me dig it out of there.
I can't in good faith ask the University to do it.
We'd dig for months, and spend thousands, and maybe all we'd find would be these.
Look, note the black coloring, characteristic of the meteor.
The fusion from heat, the nickel and the iron. Facts, John. Facts.
Even the angle of contact with the earth.
Everything points towards it being a meteor.
All right, all right. I'll admit
I don't have all the answers...
And one more point, John. Come on.
Find anything, Bob?
No, Doctor. Not a thing.
There you are. See, there's no sign of any excessive radioactivity anywhere in the area.
Odd, wouldn't you say, for something coming in from outer space?
I don't know what's odd and what isn't anymore.
But I do know I expected you to be more open to the idea than the others.
You're a man of science!
And therefore less inclined to witchcraft, John.
Not witchcraft, Dr. Snell. Imagination.
Willingness to believe that there are lots of things that we don't know anything about.
Look, there was a time when people thought the Earth was a level plain between two mountains that were set there to hold up the sky.
And that the stars were lamps hung from that sky.
Then a better idea came along, and people were willing to listen.
Be realistic, John.
We've worked together before.
In the meantime, you can do an article for us.
Yeah.
Here. I already have.
An intense young man.
Yeah, and an odd one, too.
More than odd, Bob. Individual and lonely.
A man who thinks for himself.
"Report on the Arrival of Strangers from Outer Space."
I had been hoping I'd run into you, Putnam.
What's the matter, Matt?
Did I break a law or something?
Hey, you might call it that.
Ellen's supposed to be teaching school today.
I told her to stay out of this.
You know Ellen.
Yeah, I know Ellen. I also knew her father. I was his deputy.
And I mean to keep an eye on her.
Trouble is she keeps trailing after you.
See, this town doesn't understand you.
Poking around out here in the desert, squinting up at the stars.
And now you come up with this story.
"This town"...
The reason I came out here to the desert was to try and get away from that kind of thinking.
Putnam, you frighten them.
And what frightens them, they're against. One way or another.
Look, Matt. I'm frightened, too.
You want to destroy yourself, that's your lookout.
But leave Ellen alone.
She needs her job.
Come on, Miss Fields. Give us a story.
Smile, please, Miss Fields.
Joe, get her, will you?
What about this monster you ran into last night?
Come on, fellows, come on.
Stop bothering her, will you?
Just checking your story.
What are you trying to prove?
That's what I was going to ask you.
Maybe you're getting publicity for a new book you're writing.
John...
Don't get sore, Putnam. You're news now.
Just trying to get a story!
Snell agrees with the Sheriff, and the Sheriff agrees with the others.
- I'm crazy.
- Oh, I know.
Matt was at me before he found you.
"A teacher has responsibilities to the community."
I just wish we had found one of them, that's all.
Just one little monster to toss into the principal's bedroom.
An occasion to make the soul tremble.
Thank you, sir.
This is your local announcer again, and here's Major Benson, of the United
States Army, to give us his view.
Major, will the army attempt to dig underneath the crater?
Uh, probably not.
Well, Major, how do you feel about the report that a spaceship is buried there?
If there is, it'll have to wait until we can get around to it.
Then the army isn't afraid of any invaders?
Well, Not if they are buried under hundreds of tons of...
Look.
Seems like it'll reach out.
Hmm.
It's alive.
And yet it looks so dead out there.
Oh, no, it's alive and waiting for you.
Ready to kill you if you go too far.
The sun will get you, the cold at night.
A thousand ways the desert can kill.
Where are you?
What do you look like?
What am I supposed to be looking for?
I know you're out there, hiding in the desert.
Maybe I'm looking right at you and don't even see you.
Come on out.
But, John.
Hiya, Frank. George.
Well, where'd you two come from?
Why aren't you back at the crater?
I don't much like the show they're putting on over there.
Hear they got you going, John.
Are they riding you, boy?
They're trying to.
I read the morning papers.
Don't let them ride you too much.
Uh-huh.
Have you two seen anything unusual this morning?
You mean, like another meteor?
No, I don't mean like a meteor.
No, we ain't seen nothing. Have we, Frank?
- Have we, Frank?
- What?
I said we haven't seen nothing, have we?
No, I haven't seen anything.
But I'm sure hearing things.
Yeah?
What kind of things?
Well, I don't know. Darndest noise ever.
Never heard anything like it on the wires before.
Ah, you've been out in the sun all morning.
No, it's not the sun.
- Mind if I give a listen?
- Sure.
Put him on the ladder, George.
You're the boss.
Here, listen.
You hear it?
Yeah.
Any idea what it is?
I don't know.
It might be somebody up that way tapping the wires, or back that way, listening to us, like we're listening to him.
I wonder who it is.
I don't know.
After you've been working out on the desert fifteen years, like I have, you hear a lot of things.
See a lot of things, too.
Sun in the sky, and the heat.
All that sand out there with the rivers, lakes, that aren't real at all.
And sometimes you think that the wind gets in the wires and hums, and listens, and talks.
Just like what we're hearing now.
Still hear it?
No, it's gone.
Well, that's the way it is.
Comes and goes.
- Had enough?
- Yeah.
Me, too.
Well, what do you make of it?
I'm not sure yet.
Wish I could figure it out.
Why don't we drive up the line a ways and take a squint?
Anything you say, boss.
We'll have a look up the other way.
If you find anything, let us know.
Be glad to.
Got a big date with Jane tonight, boss.
If you're thinking of getting off early, the answer is no.
When are you gonna get married and settle down, George?
Soon as I find me a wife like yours.
You always say the right thing, don't you?
Especially to the boss.
- Look at that!
- What is it?
Did you see something, John?
No. No, nothing up here.
We'd better go back and find Frank and George.
Do you think they'll find something?
Could be.
- There.
- Yeah.
Wait.
Maybe they walked off in the desert.
Why would they leave the doors open?
They were in a hurry, all right.
Maybe they chased something.
Or something chased them.
Blood.
Look, Johnny.
They saw something, all right.
Whatever it was, it took them along.
George.
Hello.
- You gave us a start.
- Did I?
Where's Frank?
George, where's Frank?
He went off to look around.
There's blood on the truck. What happened?
I cut my hand. See?
Is it bad...
What's wrong?
Nothing. The sun, I guess.
Playing tricks on me.
Yes, the sun. Beautiful.
You...
You found nothing up here?
Nothing.
We may as well get along, Johnny.
Don't worry about Frank.
He'll be all right.
Yes.
Well, I guess there's nothing more we can do up here.
So long, George.
We'll be in touch with you.
So long.
What is it back there, John?
What's the matter with his eyes?
He's lying. I didn't want to start anything alone out here.
We've got to get into town and bring help.
Something's happened to Frank.
He's dead.
Are you all right?
What happened, George? Is the truck...
Don't be afraid.
It is within our power to transform ourselves to look like you, or anyone.
For a time, it will be necessary.
We cannot, we would not take your souls, or minds, or bodies.
Don't be afraid.
Your friend is all right.
- Mind closing the door?
- You're coming right out with us, Matt.
You wanted some proof, Matt?
Maybe we've got something for you now.
School principal was in here.
You've got to listen to him, Matt.
You're supposed to be teaching school.
Don't you hear us, Matt?
We've got some proof for you now.
I'm a busy man, Ellen.
And even if I wasn't, he's not going to make a fool out of me, the way he has of you.
If you don't listen to him, you'll be the fool.
He's got you so you'll believe anything.
All right, just what did you see?
Come on, I'll show it to you.
You better bring your gun.
The truck's gone.
It was right there, Matt.
This time I saw, too.
The tracks, Johnny. Show him.
- The tracks are gone.
- Mmm-hmm.
Right here. This is where I saw him.
I saw his hand.
Look. Blood.
Could have been a jackrabbit hit by a car, and crawled in through here.
I tell you, it was Frank. It had to be.
All right, it was Frank, and he's risen from the dead and gone off with his truck.
Now, I'm going back to town.
Thanks for the ride.
It's like beating against thin air.
No marks, no signs, no nothing.
And, Ellen, the pallor of that face.
Maybe it was the sun, just playing tricks on us.
Was it?
The way he kept looking into the sun without blinking.
How could George do it?
George couldn't.
What do you mean?
It's like some nightmare, where you're waiting and hoping for it to be over and then all of a sudden, you realize that it's just...
George? Frank?
Frank? George?
Wait! I want to talk to you.
George? Frank?
Keep away.
Where have you been?
We've been looking all over for you.
I want to help you.
What happened out there, in the desert?
Tell me, and we'll go to the Sheriff.
Stand back.
Whoever you are, whatever you are,
I want to understand you.
I want to help you.
Then keep away.
Keep away, John Putnam.
We don't want to hurt you.
You least of all.
We don't want to hurt anyone.
What have you done with them?
Your friends are alive.
They will not be harmed, if you do as we say.
What are we supposed to do?
Give us time.
Time, or terrible things will happen.
Things so terrible, you have yet to dream of them.
Is old Tom back with that grub yet?
I sure am getting powerful hungry.
Ain't seen him yet.
Ain't to my liking neither, hauling grub at this time of the night.
Come on, mule.
Sam and Toby will be hungry.
Why, you crazy mule!
That you, Tom?
What's going on in there?
Well, the way to tell is take a look.
It's just this poor old tunnel.
Needs more propping up.
Like a man gets old. Needs propping up.
Wouldn't have needed it, if that meteor hadn't stuck its nose smack in that lower level.
Yeah, we best check it in the morning.
Must be Tom now.
Well, it took him long enough.
That you, Tom?
No one has yet turned up any bug-eyed monsters threatening Earth, and so it must be set down as another one of those fantastic hoaxes.
This one by a young, publicity-seeking astronomer.
Of course, if he should turn up a spaceman or two, this network cordially invites them to address us, one and all.
And now, for some last-minute news.
I was trying to help.
- What do we do now?
- Nothing. We wait.
We sit and we wait and we trust them to make it clear for us.
Come on. I'll take you home.
You've got nothing to blame yourself about, John.
What else could you do?
But, Ellen, are we right in just sitting by?
We are right, and we're not crazy.
And if we've been seeing things, it's because we did see them.
Evening, Miss Fields.
What's the idea, Perry?
Sheriff wants to see Johnny.
Yeah? What are you made-up for?
I'm a spaceman, out of the crater.
Says for you to get over there, right away.
Okay, okay.
See you.
Matt.
You know Frank's wife, Mrs. Daylon.
Of course.
- How do you do?
- Miss Dean, a friend of George's.
- Hello, Jane.
- Hi.
Mrs. Daylon, tell John, here, what you told me.
Well, the minute he came home,
I knew there was something wrong.
It seems Frank took off under peculiar circumstances.
He came home and told her he was assigned to some sort of special job overnight, and left.
Something's wrong, I know it.
He was so pale, he had the queerest look in his eyes, and he never touched his food.
Same for George.
His landlady told me he skipped dinner.
And that ain't like George, not with his appetite.
Mr. Putnam, the Sheriff says that you saw both of them this afternoon.
Did they say anything about going anywhere tonight?
No, Mrs. Daylon. Not a thing.
Well, maybe they had an emergency call to make.
Telephone people say no.
And that truck we couldn't find this afternoon.
The phone company called up and reported it missing.
Were they drunk or anything?
I mean, did you get it on their breath?
Frank never drinks. He's sick, I tell you.
If you ask me, they ain't ever coming back.
Otherwise, what would they want to take their clothes for?
- Their clothes?
- Yes.
It seems natural to take a change of clothes, they said they'd be gone overnight, didn't they?
I know George. Always on the move, always wanting to go somewhere.
You best go home and get some sleep, the both of you.
I'll check around and call you later.
Ellen, Johnny and I have some things to talk over.
Would you mind taking the ladies home?
Of course, and I'll stay with Mrs. Daylon for a while, too.
- We're taking your car, Johnny.
- I'll see you later, Ellen.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Now are you ready to believe me?
I'm trying to, or I wouldn't have sent for you.
You've got to believe that there's a ship buried out there in the desert.
And that at least some of our visitors from outer space got out of that ship before it was covered over.
Go on.
Two of those visitors I saw today, and so did you.
It's true, Matt.
Oh, it's no use, Johnny.
I try to stay with you, but I can't.
You've got to.
I know what you're thinking, Matt.
But you've got to believe that what you saw today was only what looked like Frank and George.
They didn't, by any chance, tell you what they wanted?
They want us to trust them.
To believe that Frank and George are in no danger as long as we don't interfere with them.
To give them time! Time!
Did it occur to you that you might be gambling with their lives?
Yeah, what do you think you were doing when you refused to believe me?
Frank and George, that's crazy.
I tell you, I came face to face with them.
But how could they take over anyone else's form?
- And where's the real Frank and George?
- I don't know.
And why would they want to do that? Why?
Maybe to move about freely.
To come into town without being stopped.
So they steal a telephone truck, something that'll stick out like a torch.
Now, does that make sense?
It might. Suppose they wanted electrical equipment.
That truck was loaded with it.
As a matter of fact, things have been happening around here this evening.
The hardware store was broken into.
And they're missing a coil of copper wire and some metal parts.
Nothing else taken but electrical equipment.
There you are.
Yeah? Yeah, this is Sheriff Warren.
No, the last I saw of Dr. Snell and his assistant, they were out at the crater.
You let me know if you hear anything, and if I hear anything, I'll give you a ring.
What about Dr. Snell?
Would they have any use for him?
They might. He's an astronomer. Why?
That was his secretary calling.
They haven't seen him or his assistant.
Last I saw of them, they were out on the desert, working alone.
Let's go.
They're not around here and it's a cinch they just didn't leave without their car.
I'd give anything if things were back the way were this morning with me calling you a fool.
Is it reasonable for anything to stay alive, after hitting Earth that hard?
It's reasonable, because it's true.
Believing all this talk about taking over other people's forms.
That's crazy, I tell you.
Nothing would ever add up.
I couldn't even be sure that you're
John Putnam standing beside me.
That's right, you couldn't.
Wouldn't it be a fine trick if I weren't really John Putnam at all?
Something from another world, come here to give you a lot of false leads.
Frank, what are you doing here?
I have been waiting for you.
We've been looking all over for you.
- Are you all right?
- Yes.
I'll take you home.
No. Take me to the mine.
Oh, no. No, please.
Hello? Who is this?
Who?
It's for you.
This is John Putnam.
What?
But...
Yes.
They've got Ellen.
Ellen?
- Where?
- Come on.
How do you know we're supposed to stop here?
- I know.
- Well, let's go.
No. They want to see me alone.
You wait here.
I was thinking about Ellen.
So am I.
She's safe, but if you come along,
I don't know.
All right, I'll wait. How long?
As long as it takes.
Well, be careful.
Ellen?
Ellen!
Ellen, wait!
Ellen?
Ellen?
Ellen.
Here.
Here.
Where's Ellen? Where's Ellen?
Stay where you are.
Come out in the open.
Come out where I can see you.
No.
Let me see you as you really are.
What do you want? What are you doing?
We are repairing our ship to leave your world.
We need your help.
You ask me to help you.
How can I, when you've kidnapped and stolen?
For all I know, even murdered.
We have a long way to go.
By nightfall, we will have left your Earth.
You will not see us until it is time.
Time for what? Time to kill?
Time to take over?
We have souls and minds, and we are good.
Then why are you hiding?
We are not yet ready to meet in friendship.
Why not?
Because you would be horrified at the sight of us.
Had you fallen on our world, it might have been different.
We understand more.
All I understand is that you've taken my friends captive.
And now the girl.
We hold her hostage, as well as the others.
Keep your people away, or we will destroy them.
How do I know that your whole mission here isn't to destroy all of us?
Our mission was to another world.
You must believe me.
Only an error dragged us toward Earth.
Stand out in the sun.
In time, perhaps.
Then I can't believe you.
Let us stay apart, the people of your world and ours.
For if we come together, there will only be destruction.
I've got to see you as you really are.
Come out, or I can't take the responsibility of protecting you.
Very well, then. You asked to see this.
So you shall.
Where's Ellen?
- She's safe.
- Where?
What did they do to you?
Nothing.
Men don't look the way you look for nothing.
I saw them, Matt.
I saw them as they really are.
Horrible.
You left Ellen with them?
She's safe, as long as we don't interfere.
Maybe that's the way you want it, but not me.
I want Ellen and the rest of them out now.
You think I would've walked off and left her if I didn't have to?
They're leaving tonight.
They crashed here by mistake, and now they're fixing their ship to get out!
They can't get out.
They're buried under tons of earth.
Now take me to Ellen.
I tell you, she's safe as long as you don't interfere!
Then why don't they come out in the open?
Because they don't trust us.
Because what we don't understand, we want to destroy.
I kill only what tries to kill me.
That spider, why are you afraid of it?
Because it has eight legs?
Because its mouth moves from side to side, instead of up and down?
If it came towards you, what would you do?
This.
Exactly as you'd destroy anything you didn't understand.
Don't you see, Matt?
That's why they've been hiding behind other men's faces until they can clear out.
You're wasting time.
Are you going to tell me where they are or do I form a posse and run the desert with a net until we find them?
Once before you wouldn't believe me.
When are you going to stop being a badge and become a human being?
That's my job.
A thing is wrong, you set it right.
Matt, listen to me. They weren't fooling.
They need a few more hours.
If you go to them with men now, they'll kill Ellen!
Is that what you want?
All right, we'll wait.
But the responsibility is yours.
Now, where are they?
They're in the old Excelsior mineshaft.
Now, come on, come on.
Let's get back to town.
I want everyone out of the area.
No exceptions.
Reed, make it sound like there's nothing to it.
I think you're making a mistake.
This fellow Putnam, he's done nothing but talk you out of things and get his own way.
He runs you ragged.
Now he's got you sitting by, just waiting.
So far, we don't know any more than we knew at the beginning.
And Ellen's still missing. If I was you,
I'd get them rifles into the hands of some men and clean it up, whatever it is.
I gave you an order, now get going!
Okay, Sheriff.
But I wouldn't want the responsibility.
Well, I'm playing it your way, right down the line.
Even clearing everyone away from the crater.
That's the way you wanted it, right?
It's got to be right.
What are you doing here?
I thought you were going to sweat it out at home.
They paid me a visit, Matt.
They took some of my clothes.
- Why do you suppose they'd do that?
- I don't know.
Couldn't be that they've been lying to you, could it?
That old mine they've been hiding in.
There were three men working it.
They ever tell you what happened to them?
What do they want with so many of us?
What are they planning, Johnny?
- Are they telling the truth, or what?
- You keep throwing these questions at me.
All I can do is guess.
Now your clothes, too.
Could be any one of them.
Stop working yourself up, Matt. It's hot enough without raising your blood pressure.
Yeah.
Did you know, Putnam, that more murders are committed at 92 degrees Fahrenheit than any other temperature?
I read an article once.
Lower temperatures, people are easy-going.
Over 92, it's too hot to move.
But just 92, people get irritable.
That clock...
Don't do anything.
Look at him.
Walking around like he belongs here.
The sooner they finish, the sooner they'll clear out.
How do we know they're really walking around in our clothes or Frank's, or George's, or Ellen's?
We've come this far, we've got to see it through.
What do you mean, "see it through"?
How do we know they're not taking over?
They could be all around us and I wouldn't know it.
- Hey, you! Wait right there!
- Matt!
Stay where you are.
Sorry, Matt.
It was the only way I could stop you.
Johnny, come here.
You guys in the park, over there.
Sir, you in the truck. I need help.
All the help I can get.
Look, some guy's taking off in your car.
We'll get to him later. Come on.
All right, Bill, pass out those rifles, will you?
You head for the point at the highway and we'll cut off the truck by taking the east route.
- Mike, Harry, come with me.
- Okay.
Cut out into the desert here, and set up the barricade here.
All right, men, follow me!
All right, men, spread out across the road.
Throw some flares up in the front, and put some in the back, there.
There's his truck.
That's it, put another one over there.
All right. Check your guns and check your ammunition now.
He'll be coming any minute.
Here he comes now.
Hold your fire. Get ready.
All right. Let him have it.
Who's there?
Ellen?
Ellen?
No, you're not Ellen.
You're dressed in her clothes, but you're not Ellen.
They're on their way here.
You brought them.
Listen to me.
I came here to warn you.
I tried to stop them, you don't know how I tried.
You've got to get out.
Just a few more hours.
Listen to me.
You wanted me to fall into that. Why?
You can no longer be trusted.
Whoever you are, whatever you are, listen to me!
I'm sorry.
We did not want to use violence.
Now there's no other way.
Would you kill me, too?
So this is the end?
The grand total of all our dreams.
I came here to help you, not to kill.
Stay where you are.
Yes, look at its power.
Power to drive a ship through space.
Power to tear your Earth apart.
You know how long we've worked on this?
A thousand years of reaching for the stars.
Now, at last, we've conquered space.
Ah. The dreams we had of knowing other worlds.
Listen to me. There's still a way.
Is there? With a mob after us?
All we needed was time.
Let the others go.
I'll try and hold off the mob.
And if you fail?
No. We'd rather have it end here, than fall into their hands.
Wait!
You speak of how wonderful it was going to be to know other worlds.
A thousand years of work, and you're willing to see it all end here, abruptly, on this strange planet?
Is that the way you want it?
When there might still be a chance?
Then go and stop them.
Free the girl first. Show the mob you mean them no harm.
How can I trust you?
You can always reach out and destroy us with that.
Send them out.
Johnny.
Come on, quick.
Come on.
There's the entrance.
Clear away, everybody.
Clear away. Keep running, Ellen.
Hey. Hey. Any way to close off this entrance?
There's some dynamite back there.
Get it. Quick. Get it.
Hurry up. We've got to keep that posse away from them.
Were they in there?
Yeah.
I guess that takes care of them.
Yeah. That takes care of them.
What's that?
Wait. Listen.
Well, they've gone.
For good, John?
No, just for now.
It wasn't the right time for us to meet.
But there'll be other nights.
Other stars for us to watch.
They'll be back.
On tests in Northern Australia,
a prototype of the nuclear motor designed to power the Quatermass II rocket
has gone into a runaway reaction,
ending in a disastrous explosion.
In the rocket research station in England, its twin reveals the same latent faults.
Professor Bernard Quatermass and his staff, now including Doctor Leo Pugh
and his own daughter Paula,
realise that the extensive project to colonise the Moon may have to be abandoned.
Then an interruption. Captain John Dillon has tracked falling meteorites by radar
and, against orders, has managed to recover one.
Reassembled, the object proves to have been hollow. Visiting the scene of the incidents,
Quatermass and Dillon come upon a closed area and a vast government plant
that is said to be heavily guarded.
Its appearance disturbs them.
Then, as they venture closer to the place, another meteorite falls.
They are able to locate it, still in one piece.
Can you smell it? Ammonia.
Dillon! There's something on your face!
Dillon!
It's gone, but there was something, I swear.
Are you all right?
All right? Don't know.
Uh... don't know.
Whatever else came out of that, there was certainly ammonia. You got a lungful.
Take some deep breaths. Try!
Similar to the first one.
Hollowed in the same way.
Thistledown.
What I saw...
What I thought I saw was transparent.
Just for a moment it shone and then...
Is your face still sore? Let me see. Look up.
Look to the light.
Yes, there is something there.
A kind of... Just on the hairline.
A discoloured indentation.
Don't touch!
Keep back!
Tell them. Tell.
All right, Dillon. If you won't start talking, I will.
Take a look at this.
Be careful - it needs expert examination.
It's some sort of meteorite.
We saw it fall and came to examine it.
- Who are you?
- That doesn't matter.
- You are in a restricted area.
- Let me talk to somebody in authority in there.
- I'll explain when we get there.
- Explain.
It was intact when it fell.
That's almost unknown for a meteorite.
It broke up as we looked at it.
This man was affected. Something came from it.
Gas, at any rate. Is this a military establishment?
Get those pieces.
No! Don't you realise the importance of observations?
- Take him.
- Wait a minute.
- He will be given treatment.
- There?
- He must come.
- Are you arresting him?
- He must.
- Yes...
- I'm sorry, Dillon. I'll explain.
- You will go. Now. While you can.
- But I will tell them that I am responsible.
- Do not try. Go.
Dillon, I'm sorry I got you into this mess.
I'll find some way.
No, don't follow. Don't try to follow!
- Dillon!
- Go now. Go.
Psst!
Hi there.
- Who are you?
- I got no business here, same as you.
Have they gone?
Yes.
Lucky they didn't pinch you, too.
You were watching?
- Through there.
- Did you see that thing fall?
- What thing?
- That... that stone.
Stone? Nah. I was asleep until all the whistles and shouting.
I come here last night, after dark.
Woke up and seen all them fellas around with guns all over the place.
So I lay low all day.
- Soon be dark again.
- Why are you here?
Got a gasper?
I reckon to pass by this way once a year.
- There used to be a village here.
- Yes.
Winnerden Flats. Ta.
I heard tales of this coming along the road, but I didn't believe it.
They must have smashed the whole place flat with them bulldozers.
Why?
There was nice people about here.
Open-handed.
When you were here a year ago, the place was normal?
Thriving.
Woman gave me a brace of chickens.
Give 'em to me.
But there was a government research unit?
Only a few little huts. I didn't mind them.
They didn't bother me very much.
A bit different from that.
It's not finished yet.
All day long, banging and riveting.
And the men they've got working in there.
Thousands of them.
Like an army.
I've seen 'em come, I've seen 'em go.
In big lorries.
- Where? Do you know?
- Look...
- On the horizon?
- A whole town. New-built.
I come through there.
No good. Not all these prefab estates.
They've got no time for trampers.
"Dig the garden and I'll give you your dinner."
"I'm going on," I said.
Somewhere I can get proper treatment.
Winnerden Flats.
What have you got there? A flint?
Plenty of them about.
- Too many.
- It's not a flint.
- Of course it is.
- It's worn and weathered by long exposure.
What else could it be?
Look, they're all over the place.
You're a funny fella with stones, aren't you?
What do you do? Collect them?
You'll bust your pockets.
You'd better get going.
How far to that prefab town?
- Turn north by the sea, then about five miles.
- Thanks.
Here. Don't hang around.
Gone down to the boozer for a quick one,
I suppose.
Yes. Yeah, keep an eye out for him.
And chase the mother up here, will you?
Tell them...
Tell them she's been wandering again.
Yes. Yes, thanks, Bob.
I was right. Why these people can't look after their kiddies, I don't know.
- Hello. What can I do for you?
- Are there any police in this town?
- Police?
- There are none?
Well, we're the police. The Camp Committee.
- What if you can't handle something?
- Doesn't often happen.
- With construction teams and labour gangs?
- Look, mister, if we need police assistance, we get it from outside. Now, what's your business?
I'm worried about a friend of mine.
We were near that plant where your men work.
- He was taken ill, the guards took him away.
- It's a prohibited area. You must have known.
This is a free country in time of peace.
I have rights and will use them.
Right. You've used them.
Happy?
What are you supposed to represent?
A publicly appointed committee?
We represent the workers on that project.
We're doing all right.
A lot more than all right.
We're asked to co-operate by keeping our mouths shut. Just like in the war.
- We try to do our best.
- You succeed!
We don't like people who make it difficult.
I have trodden where some bureaucrat didn't wish me to tread, but does that put me beyond your aid?
Look, mister, your friend will have been taken to the infirmary.
He wouldn't have come to any harm.
Let's check that, shall we?
- Shall I ring?
- Telephone the police.
I'll make a full statement of what happened.
What are you grinning at?
- You said you call in police help sometimes.
- Yes. Their police.
Those guards. It's a security arrangement.
Shall I ring?
Now, look, don't worry about your friend.
- They'll take him to another hospital.
- I'll ring the county constabulary.
No!
Honestly, they wouldn't deal.
Wouldn't deal? What IS this place?
Oh, really, mister. Can't you read?
Excuse me... Oh, there she is. Poor little love.
Mr Dawson, I'm ever so sorry about this, about all the trouble you've had.
I've told her a hundred times, but it makes no difference.
- Where was she?
- Heading up there. Bob Rigby found her.
- You naughty girl.
- There'll be trouble.
- I know, I know!
- No one's allowed there.
Yes, Mr Dawson. I don't like to blame her.
Since she was sick, she's not been the same.
- Sick?
- Are you still here?
- Tell me about it. When did it happen?
- A few months ago, just after we moved here.
She was out playing somewhere and was taken queer.
She seemed to get over it, but since then... she wanders.
- Where to?
- Only up there to the place. Eh, Mr Dawson?
Did you ever see anything like this?
Did you find something once?
When you were playing?
That broke into pieces like this?
And then you were sick?
And then there was this mark?
I seen it a long time ago.
It's never given any trouble.
Are you making out I neglect her?
- Was anybody else sick?
- Nobody! Is he some sort of inspector?
No. I'm putting a stop to this. A little while ago,
I asked you to leave. Now I'm not asking.
- Don't be a fool, man.
- Fool?!
I think there's something wrong. Danger.
Tell me!
- Tell you what?
- Oh, I don't know the full facts.
- What is this place? What's being made there?
- You're mad.
For heaven's sake, forget these posters for just five seconds!
Get on your way.
You want to meet those guards again?
I'll give you a count of three.
- That got rid of him.
- Well! You were right. He must've been mad.
The things he was saying. Why...
This isn't nothing.
Look, Mr Dawson. Is it, now?
- Dr Pugh?
- Yes?
- Ready for the test.
- Oh, good.
Mm, not a bad section.
It's difficult to find a decent one from one of these fragments.
That's a trace of metallic mineral, isn't it? There.
Yes. Let's see.
If that etches into the standard pattern, this must be a normal meteorite.
- Yes.
- Leo, am I interrupting something?
Oh, not at all.
- Is your father back?
- Not yet.
- What are you looking for?
- An etched pattern. A Widmanstatten shape.
A test for a genuine meteorite.
No, nothing.
- It isn't one?
- No.
- It may not be.
- What about the fact of it being hollow?
A small cavity is not unheard of.
But according to the ploughman there was a smell of gas.
Seven different gases can occur in stony meteorites. We've nothing positive to go on.
- Father, did you find out anything?
- Some.
- Where's Johnny?
- He's not with me.
- I'm afraid he's in some sort of trouble.
- Trouble?
Yes, he's not well. He's being looked after.
- But where is he?
- In a strange place.
- A very strange place.
- For heaven's sake, tell us!
We went to the ploughman as we intended.
He wasn't very co-operative.
No, there was nothing more you could have done. I see that.
I didn't leave it at that.
I went to the county police.
They were polite, but said they had no jurisdiction.
How do you connect these meteorites with this mysterious production plant?
- Think they came from it?
- No, I'm certain of that.
- What do you think is wrong with Johnny?
- He was affected with this gas.
- How about phoning where he is stationed?
- He's at a temporary training post.
The base camp. They may know something.
Yes, I'll do that.
- Leo, there's more to it.
- I thought so.
It wasn't only the gas that affected Dillon.
There was something... else.
- You saw it?
- Just for a minute, clinging to his face.
- What?
- I may be wrong, but just for a moment...
It was like a soap bubble that burst.
It wasn't unlike a bubble.
Perhaps I'm imagining it.
But ever since that time, so long ago...
- Perhaps I'm too ready to... to expect...
- Take a look at this.
I got a plaster cast made of the first meteorite.
Now, assuming that the shape suffered from ablation in the higher levels of the atmosphere, with a little reconstruction...
...the original might well have been like this.
- You've been busy.
- It's more than a guess. We worked it out.
Something like this, travelling at the correct angle, not too fast...
Could skim through Earth's atmosphere before breaking itself up, gradually losing speed through braking ellipses and even land in one piece.
- The same principle as rocket descent.
- And that, of course, implies a great deal.
Rocket descent. The result of knowledge.
Mathematics. Precise planning.
Intelligence.
Now, we know the weight, the approximate speed of descent, mass...
- I've got some further data.
- Excellent.
How do you feel? Up to making a start?
If we can find some sort of a source...
- Any news?
- He couldn't return to his unit.
He's being transferred.
- The radar post? Moved from that position?
- Could that be significant?
Probably not. I'm going up to London tomorrow.
I'll probably get the answers then.
Paula, you must leave us. We have work to do.
Oh, don't worry about that.
It's just some idle speculation of Leo's.
No...
No!
Come in, sir.
Do sit down.
You've come at a most awkward time.
I'm just tying up a very difficult case.
- You asked to see Inspector Lomax.
- I know him.
I'm afraid he's no longer with us.
- I hope I won't embarrass you with this query.
- It won't be easy, sir. Try.
Last night I... happened to trespass upon a prohibited area.
Really? An army range?
Excuse me.
Inspector Clifford. Uh-huh?
Yes, I know. The embezzlement case.
You've got him there?
I suppose there's no doubt that he was a witness?
Right you are, Sergeant.
Well, keep him there for a moment, will you?
- Now, sir, about this prohibited area.
- I admit it's a technical offence.
We shall assume you did not go there as an enemy agent.
When we were near the plant, my friend was taken ill. The guards arrested him.
- The plant. Where exactly was it?
- At a place called Winnerden Flats.
- I'm afraid I can't help you.
- There are matters needing investigation.
- I can do nothing. It's under special authority.
- What authority? What's its purpose?
- Now you do embarrass me.
- This man was ill. He was affected by...
I've got to know his condition. Great Heavens!
I didn't expect to find bureaucratic idiocy here!
I know my duty, sir.
If you must have special favours, go to your own contacts at the Ministry.
Ministry?
I must ask you to leave now. I have things to do.
- The same Ministry that handles my research?
- Good morning, sir.
Tell Sergeant Best to bring that man up right away. The embezzlement witness!
We've a great deal to get through.
Pompous, self-important people coming here...
Well, there you are.
You've got all the evidence I can produce, all the facts as I know them.
Now, Fowler, it's up to you.
Man, haven't you ANY reaction?
I want you to get in touch with Mr Vincent
Broadhead. In the lower conference room.
441, isn't it? Find out if they're in recess.
Ask him to come up here as soon as he can.
- Was that a sufficiently dramatic response?
- I hope you're not taking this lightly.
On the contrary. I'm going beyond the limits.
Quatermass, we've had dealings for a number of years, you as a driving force of an enterprise of the future,
I as one of the obstructive civil servants you have to contend with.
- My dear Fowler...
- How's it going?
- I haven't referred to that.
- How is it?
- Badly, since that trouble on test.
- You'll want extra funds?
And you'll refuse them?
We've been cutting you down.
The decision lies elsewhere.
- It always does.
- It's policy to support a number of projects.
- That makes them, in a sense, your rivals.
- What are you getting at?
Well, it could be said that to come with such a curious account about a rival project...
- Are you serious?
- I must put it to you.
But I didn't know it was yours!
- Thank you. I accept that.
- Now, what is it?
- Strictly between these walls?
- Of course.
The place at Winnerden Flats is harmless.
It's to make synthetic food.
Synthetic food?!
Guards and guns?!
Oh, I have no personal knowledge.
It's an entirely different section, a new special section.
- You don't like it either.
- Like it?
Oh, I expect I'm hidebound.
Nothing you can pin down.
A face in the corridor.
Yes...
Petty mysteries.
An overheard phrase.
Altered routines. Changes.
Hello. Yes?
The recess? And Mr Broadhead?
- Thank you. On his way up.
- Who is he?
You don't read the newspapers?
He's usually a rugged individualist or a damned troublemaker.
- An MP?
- Quite a new boy. I knew him years ago.
He's a talker.
Just now he's engaged in a sort of one-man inquiry that he's managed to force.
- Inquiry?
- He's ahead of you.
It's into Winnerden Flats.
- Mr Fowler's expecting me. Broadhead.
- Oh, yes, sir.
Somebody with him?
What's this about, Fowler?
I hope you realise how little time I've got.
Here's someone I think you ought to meet.
Don't take any calls for the next few minutes.
Yes, sir.
- And all this happened last night?
- All that I was personally concerned with, yes.
I don't know what to make of it.
There's oddness enough.
- At the inquiry?
- Aye. I resume in five minutes.
- What sort of oddness?
- Confine yourself to giving information.
No, it's too much.
All this stuff you're telling me is speculation.
- It's true. I have expert knowledge.
- You specialise in rockets and things.
- The specialist sees things in his own light.
- A stupid generalisation.
There were those armed guards...
A sick man arrested. I'll try to use that.
- Who are on this inquiry?
- Please, please.
No, let him ask it. I've been sickened with damn secrecy this morning.
Members of the Commission and me.
It's to be a one-man confidential report.
Silly, isn't it?
More secrecy, but the fight I had even for that and, in the end, through a technical loophole.
How's it going? Finding what you wanted?
They're beating me, I admit it. Evasion!
Never once an answer that means anything.
And this is the joke - I'm trying to help them!
- Do you know what Winnerden Flats is?
- Synthetic food.
A revolutionary process. Years of vain experiment. Suddenly, bingo - they've got it!
- When?
- About a year ago.
A headlong rush then to get a factory built.
Tremendous costs.
- What was the hurry?
- To beat the rest of the world to it.
- Now they're ready to go ahead.
- Production?
- Any day now, apparently.
- I see.
There's no signs of a distribution set-up.
No sales organisation, nothing.
They're trapped in their damn secrecy!
And now this.
- A production plant.
- Aye, an aerial photograph of it.
- Here's another. The same?
- Seems to be.
That one was taken on an inspection flight over Central Siberia.
- What?!
- And this.
Brazil.
Not much doubt about it, is there?
Other people are in on this "revolutionary process"!
- They've got competitors before they start.
- No, that's not it.
- How long since those were taken?
- All very recent.
Broadhead, get me into that inquiry.
As a witness.
I've got to get in there!
All right. Come on.
Here you are. Sit down.
All here?
This is Professor Bernard Quatermass.
I've asked him to attend.
He has certain information
I wish to bring forward.
But, first, have you considered what I put to you before the recess?
A leakage of information.
In spite of all precautions.
In spite of what seemed excessive precautions.
Will you look at these aerial photographs again?
You, sir, Mr Stenning.
As Chief Biochemist to the Commission, can you give me an expert opinion?
Pick 'em up and look at 'em.
There - the mark.
Welcome, sir.
Welcome to the immortal hills.
Thank you.
It's all by way of making you feel right at home, Bobby.
Mr. chairman.
Come along, sir.
After you.
This is your place now, you know?
Of course, it isn't as if you was any stranger here, Bob.
Yes, but somehow this place all looks different to me, like I never saw it before.
Well, maybe I never had to.
It's cold as an icebox in here.
Oh, that thing hasn't worked in years.
Cement halls, the wet, you know...
Makes the air a wee bit crisp, you see.
Won't bother you none once you get down to work.
Well, I'm not sworn in yet.
Oh, that's only for show, sir.
Now, let me see if I've got the list of committeemen right.
First, chairman Robert kraft, yourself.
Now, Mr. honegger, treasurer, your uncle George, secretary, and, of course, Mr. trowbridge, and Mr. bates, making five in all, right?
Right.
You canna find me at any time.
My dwelling's straight across the boulevard, opposite the gate.
Makes it nice, living so close to my work.
Now, would you like to see the sights, sir, give the roof a chance to catch the heat?
Hmm.
If you care to make a tour, it's a bit warmer outside.
That's quite a map.
Oh, yes, sir, that's a map of the entire cemetery down to the wee-est speck of dust.
Here we are, and here's my shed with the rose stone, and there's the gate you come in.
Certainly kept it up to date, there's the new mausoleum on here, already.
Aye. Oh, yes, sir.
This map's going to be a big help to you, Bobby.
Suppose you got a customer and you want to know what ground we can show him, this is where the map comes in.
One look, and quick as a wink, you know who's where and what's what.
It's them pins that makes it so easy.
The black ones stand for the ones that is already there, and the white ones for them as has made their arrangements for the future.
Now, for example, here's my place.
Lovely, isn't she, Bob?
There.
Sun in the morning, but, eh, gets those trees to give shade in the afternoon heat.
Mckee, you've been on this job now, 40 years, right?
Aye.
Well, I guess the committee's right, it's high time we retired you.
Nothing to worry about, full pension.
You'll draw the same check every month.
I'm to be paid for nothing from now on?
No, you're to be paid for 40 years of devotion, and that's something.
Anyone in mind to replace you?
Oh, aye, uh, why I hadn't a given it much thought, sir, but, uh, why?
There must be plenty of young and hard-muscled toughs who would give their eyeteeth for my shoes.
It's a lovely place to work.
You're outside near mother earth.
Well, let me know if, uh, you find somebody, huh?
Oh, aye, I will.
Yes, sir, that's quite a map.
Pardon me, sir.
I just wanted to show you where we keep this, in case of emergencies.
No need to worry, though, we haven't had none, yet.
Oh, you expecting visitors, sir?
No, but that sounds like stu drexel.
Oh, aye!
Drexel and pretty Beth Ferris.
I heard they was promised.
Looks like they're hitched.
She finally caught me, Bob.
Bethie, many happy returns of the Clay.
Stu, that's a great place you picked for a honeymoon.
Oh, marriage has made me conservative.
How 'bout it, Mrs. d?
Can I carry you over the threshold?
I still don't think it's so very funny.
I think it's positively awful, if you really want to know the truth.
Aw, bethie, don't be that way.
What's the trouble?
How would you like to get a cemetery plot for a wedding gift?
Now, bethie, you know pop never meant it for a present.
It's just a formal legal sort of thing.
You see, dad left part of my inheritance in trust for when I got married.
One of the provisions was that myself and my wife had first-class accommodations here at the immortal hills.
Doesn't cost us a cent, but we have to buy the plots before the bank will let me have the cash.
You know, dad, he never did consider me much on responsibility.
He was a very smart man.
Oh, aye, that he was.
And though a bonny bride should have her thoughts far from doom, it's a lucky girl whose father-in-law provides from the beyond for her future.
Isn't he sweet?
Thanks, Scotty.
Bob, give us a couple near the old man, will ya?
And call Owens at the bank in the morning so I can cash a check.
I don't think it's funny at all.
From the last administration, sir.
Folks get a wee bit rocky when they come out here, sometimes.
Best to be prepared.
Down the hatch.
- Thank you.
- Mm.
Oh, over here, that's where the drexel bunch is.
Ah, it'll get so you'll love it out here, Bobby.
It's a fine and green and lovely place.
A fine place to slip away from the cares of the world.
Slip away and live a wee bit.
"As retiring chairman of the immortal hills cemetery management committee... "
- George, I haven't got...
- Sh!
"It is now my very great pleasure to announce...
- I don't even...
- Sh!
The appointment of Robert kraft, president of kraft department store... " now, George, don't shush me.
You railroaded me into this.
Now, wait a minute, Bob.
It's your turn.
Last year was his turn.
The year before, it was mine.
Nobody refuses to take the chairmanship.
Pardon us, Henry.
"President of kraft department store... " why?
Why?
Nobody ever has.
It's just not done, son.
Well, can you give me one good reason why I should take over the management of a whole big cemetery when I'm up to my neck in my own business?
"As retiring... " hold it.
Of course I can.
Tradition, particularly for us krafts.
You always harp on dignity, honor, prestige.
Well, how do you think we got it?
Because your great grandfather, your grandfather, and your father served on every community project, board, and committee that was ever created.
They served for free.
But they did it for business.
That's what a fine family has to do in this town.
And you can't refuse to do it without losing a lot of respect from our customers.
And another thing...
It's just not done.
Well, pass me over till next year.
I'm up to my ears.
Bob, do you realize you're talking about only a few hours a month, at the most?
Mckee, the caretaker, handles everything.
All you do is show up once a week and sign the checks.
- It's getting late, George...
- Proceed, Henry.
Raise your right hand.
Well, what about bill honegger?
Raise your right hand.
"Do you, Robert kraft, swear to discharge the duties and responsibilities of this office faithfully and completely, to the utmost of your abilities?"
I do.
Congratulations, Bob.
See ya.
- So long, Henry.
- Thanks, Mr. trowbridge.
Thank you, uncle George.
Uh, okay, miss Lane, you can put through his calls now.
Thank you, Mr. Watson.
I'll ring him for you now.
Hello.
There's a guy named Watson on the phone, says it's urgent.
- Do you know him?
- Of olds and Watson?
Of olds and Watson, you know.
Oh, the undertaker. Swell.
Hello.
Well, thank you very much, Mr. Watson.
I'll do the best job I can.
Yes, sir.
Aw, you're kidding.
Well, sir, uh, don't worry about it.
I'll take care of it myself.
I'll be there within an hour.
Yes, sir, thank you.
Well, what about this ad?
Have to wait, I'm sorry.
Well, now, call mckee.
You don't have to go up there every time.
This is different.
Somebody prominent?
Stu drexel and his wife.
Stu and bethie?
No.
Hi.
Hi, Jess.
Mckee, this is Mr. Jessup of the milford herald.
Hi. Jessup, Jessup...
Oh, the west slope, between the pattersons and the finleys.
What else is new?
You were my big news for the day.
"Asked about plans for the coming year, kraft revealed the immortal hills will install a drive-in bar to stimulate additional trade."
I'm stuck with the obituary detail.
Boy, it's cold in here.
Mckee, let's get that heat on no later than tomorrow, huh?
We'd better get ready for the interment.
Aye, that'll be done, sir.
And you better change the drexel pins, black instead of white.
Oh, they already got black pins, sir.
Oh? Who changed them?
Well, now, the last I remember was the very day they come out here to give you the order, and you stuck in two pins.
Yeah, I guess that's right.
I must have picked up the wrong color.
Hmm?
Oh, nothing, it's just a little weird, that's all.
What?
Well, the kids came out here right after they tied the knot, and they bought a couple of plots.
Stu was complying with some technicality in his trust.
And it was all very cute.
We had a couple of laughs, and afterwards, ljabbed two pins in the map...
White pins, I thought, just to make it official.
Now I hear today they've been killed, and the map's had them on the blacklist all the time.
Okay, so what?
Oh, nothing, it just made me feel a little eerie, that's all.
I think he means he marked the young couple for death, sir.
Yeah, I guess that was it.
That must have been the feeling I had.
Boy, it's funny what'll go through a guy's mind, isn't it?
Do me a favor, mckee.
If he starts fooling around with those pins again, be sure he stays away from the west slope, between the pattersons and the finleys.
Indeed, I will, sir.
Hi, Annie.
What are you doing out here?
I had a luncheon date, but I was stood up.
I know a nice little place down the street.
I just might take you up on that.
I won't hold my breath.
Oh.
George told me about Beth and Stuart, and I just had to see you.
Made me think how lucky we are, just to be alive and together.
Oh, Ann, this is Mr. mckee.
This is miss Craig, my fiancée, Andy.
- How do you do?
- Miss.
Would you be wanting me for anything else, Bobby?
No, thanks, Andy.
Bob.
Hmm?
What's wrong?
Oh, nothing.
I'm just a little depressed, that's all, but you'll take care of that.
Ann, I kept wishing we could keep our appointment.
Oh, rendezvous, if you don't mind.
- Your gray flannel is showing.
- Yeah.
Actually, do you know what made me turn around and come here instead of going home?
Mm-mm.
Well, I was driving along, feeling rejected, and then, all of a sudden, I saw you very clearly in my mind.
Bob, it's just that you're too attractive.
After all, president of a department store and in charge of the immortal hills?
Irresistible.
I saw you and I heard you.
"Lunchtime, Annie."
That's what you said, distinctly.
"Lunchtime, Annie"?
Well, I can do better than that, I hope.
Oh, you did.
You said...
"I want you, and I need you" and...
And a whole lot of lovely things
I'd be embarrassed to repeat.
Yeah.
You know, just about the time you were seeing me,
I had you on my mind.
That's amazing.
No, I mean it.
And I don't blame you for not wanting to repeat what I was thinking.
Oh.
Darling, we'd better go to lunch.
Or get married.
Or I can just as easily join
Jess at that little spot down the road he spoke of.
We regret the management does not permit exchanges once the merchandise has been purchased.
Then I'll freshen up.
Immortal hills, kraft.
Hi, Carl.
No, terrible.
No, I'm sorry, the funeral's been confined to the immediate family.
Yeah, all right, Carl.
I'll see you later.
No, not...
Oh, Ann, you're right.
What?
You're right.
We are lucky to...
Lucky to be alive and...
With each other.
Come on.

Oh, well, no, no, not yet, but I'm scouting the countryside.
This is far sweeter.
This is what I call getting things done.
Oh mckee, you should have been an executive.
Ah.
Hey, best take off your coat, Bobby.
You'll be getting overheated.
Fairly quiet this week, only one passing.
Now, if you'll just sign these.
Let's get rid of these flowers.
Oh, aye, they smell a wee bit sickly.
I was hoping to keep them for the burial this afternoon.
Oh, you need much help?
Oh, no.
This is just an average funeral.
They don't come like the drexel doings every day, thank the lord.
Mckee, this bill for w. Lsham, what's it for?
Why, he's the lad for this afternoon, Bobby.
Oh, no need to look so sad.
Will lsham was the same aged lad as me.
Oh, there's something that
I've been meaning to tell you.
Mighty queer it strikes me, Bob.
I went to the map just after we got the news to change will lsham's pin to black.
It was already black.
Looks like there might be something...
Creepy about that map.
Changing pin colors, without human assistance, no less.
I changed Mr. lsham's pin, Andy.
You... but, Bob, you haven't been here since he died.
Jessup, please.
I know, I changed his pin before he died, not after.
Jess, it's Bob kraft.
Can you come over here right away?
No, I'm at the cemetery.
That map's nothing but an old piece of paper hanging on the wall.
All you do when you stick pins in it is to make holes in the paper.
White pins, black pins, safety pins, it doesn't make any difference, see?
Well, look, it's unfortunate that it worked out this way, but coincidences are part of everyday life.
Some are funny, some are pretty odd, but this one isn't even good enough to make the back page of the shopping news.
That's all it is, Bob, coincidence.
Yeah.
You're right, Jess.
Thanks.
That's okay.
Sometime when I've tied on a real head-bender, you can do the same for me.
What's your trouble?
Well, nothing, but I've... been through all this before.
The grass and the quiet... and that sound.
I never knew what it was.
It's the sound of a name being cut into a headstone.
Yeah, I've... I've heard of people who thought they'd been through the same bit before in their dreams.
I think it's even happened to me.
What would you say if I told you this happens to me regularly, ever since I was a child, sometimes as often as every other week?
I'd say you were sensitive or exaggerating.
"Third-floor sportswear...
$9,280 gross."
Compared to $8,500 at the same date last year.
Hmm.
Basement sportswears...
I'm gonna call bates and honegger and trowbridge right now and tell them I'm quitting.
Don't worry, George.
Nothing drastic will happen to the store.
My mind's made up.
You mean mixed up.
I've lived in milford all my life, and I can't remember any man who ever let that place get the better of him.
Why, when I was chairman,
I'll bet I stuck the wrong colored pins in that thing a dozen times.
If I ran out of one color, i... I used the other.
You've only been down there a couple of times.
George, I put black pins in the map for the drexel couple the day they were killed.
Now, I didn't think anything of it at the time.
And then I took a white pin out of the map, quite at random, and I put a black pin in its place, and today I find out the old man it belonged to died during the week.
Bob, that's terrible.
For heaven's sake, Bob, everybody loves a ghost story.
Where's your sense of humor?
You don't really believe that stuff you're telling me, do you?
No.
But I still think i may be learning something about myself.
Where are you going?
Oh, I think I'll just take a run out to the cemetery.
What for?
Sounds like it might be fun.
After all, I've been trying to find some way to wipe out our competition for years.
Good night, George.
You want to take my car?
All right.
Won't be but a moment, sir.
Now, don't bother, mckee.
I think I've got it.
Oh, that'll be all, mckee.
Is everything all right, Bobby?
We'll see you later, Andy.
Well, the place hasn't changed a bit since I was chairman.
A few more pins in the map.
Black ones.
White ones, too.
Sit down and relax, Bob.
I think I can get this whole thing cleared up for you.
What are you gonna do?
I'm going to convince you that there's nothing out here for you to worry about.
George, let's forget this.
Uh, Bob.
I said I'm just going to convince you.
Well, George, suppose you took
Henry trowbridge's white pin out and put a black one in its place, and tomorrow morning he turned up dead.
There's not a chance.
Well, I know not a chance, but suppose by some weird coincidence, it happened.
Now, it's happened to me three times already.
I deal strictly in facts, son.
I don't go for this coincidence bunk.
But if Henry trowbridge even looks a little peaked tomorrow, you can resign, and I'll back you up.
Now, Henry trowbridge...
Let me see if I remember.
George, I just mentioned
Henry as an example.
Now, you're not gonna use him.
Why, Henry's as good a choice as anybody, considering he directly preceded you as committee chairman.
Wait a minute, George.
You, uh, better let me put the pin in.
If you do the honors and nothing happens, it won't be quite as conclusive.
By all means, let's not diverge from the established pattern.
But I'll have you know, i was no slouch when it came to pinning the tail on the donkey when I was a kid.
Uh, no reflection on Henry.
Go ahead, Bob.
You better call Henry and tell him what we did.
Eh, he'd only think we were kidding.
No, he'd believe you.
Then he'd call my physician, and he'd reserve a nice, quiet room for me at Providence hospital.
Let's keep this quiet, my boy.
Henry can't complain.
After all, if his term had run a week or so longer, he might be having the willies instead of you.
Hello?
Hello, Mrs. trowbridge, this is Bob kraft.
What are you doing up so late?
Uh, nothing serious.
Uh, I just meant to call Henry earlier, and, uh, it slipped my mind.
Uh, put him on, will ya?
Oh, if he's watching a movie and enjoying it, uh, ask him to call me back during the commercial.
No, no, Bob.
Just hold on, and I'll get him.
He's upstairs reading in bed, but I'm sure he's not asleep.
Well, I hate to disturb him.
You just hold the wire, Bob.
Hello, Henry?
Oh, he's...
He's not breathing, Bob.
I've got to call a doctor.
I understand.
I'll hang up right away.
I'm... terribly sorry.
♪ Hey, ho, nobody home a'
♪ meat nor drink nor money... x wait here.
This won't take long.
Morning!
How do you do, sir?
Well, I don't understand it.
Jess said he'd be here in 20 minutes.
I'm sure he's on his way...
Lieutenant clayborne.
So that's it, huh?
Sure big enough.
There are the black pins, eh?
We're, uh, particularly concerned with these four.
Isham, and the drexel couple and now trowbridge.
Let me get this straight,
Mr. kraft.
You say that every time you stick a black pin in the map, people turn up dead?
That's right.
Well, go ahead, lieutenant.
You think I'm a crackpot, and I hope you're right.
L just want to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt.
"Stuart and Elizabeth drexel, d.O.A., emergency receiving hospital, result of highway collision."
"William lsham, cause of death...
Cerebral hemorrhage."
"Henry trowbridge...
Coronary thrombosis."
Well, the rule is this...
Where no evidence of homicide exists on initial investigation, the matter will be dropped.
Investigated and found nothing.
Sorry.
Jessup.
What's new?
Or should I say, real?
Nothing like murder, if that's what you're after.
I'm sorry Bob saw fit to disturb you, lieutenant.
No harm done.
What do you make of it, Jess?
I keep telling him it's just coincidence.
Yeah.
If I were you, Mr. kraft,
I'd take a week or two off, take it easy.
You'll forget all about it.
If you're gonna use this story, kindly refrain from mentioning my name.
I know.
Lieutenant clayborne, with an "e" on the end.
Boy...
Didn't think four deaths could appear so flimsy to a policeman.
You never should have called the police.
Clayborne's one of the best.
Any other guy might have looked for a big, heavy book to throw at you.
Yeah, maybe you're right.
On the other hand, maybe that thing's dangerous.
Really dangerous.
Or maybe the element of danger is in a man.
In me.
Bob.
Is there something different about me, Jess?
I'm really beginning to wonder.
Hey, buddy, if there is anything to this map bit, don't go blaming it on nameless forces.
Maybe somebody's trying to scare you.
Could be you got an enemy or two?
Somebody using your desk, George?
Oh, he came in to keep me company, darling.
That was very sweet of him.
Oh, darling, you must be dead tired.
I'm all right, Ann.
No sleep, and then to have to go back
- out there again...
- I'm all right!
There's no crime in needing a good rest.
George, I've got some correspondence to take care of.
I've already taken care of your mail.
And I took the Liberty of making reservations for you.
Flight 33 leaving for Miami at 5:45.
My pal, sanford, owns one of the finest hotels on the beach...
George, thanks, anyway.
There's nothing I'd rather do, but I can't possibly go now.
Bob, I gave you my word that if anything happened to Henry, you could resign.
I talked to Charlie and bill honegger, and they understand completely.
It's all fixed, son.
The situation's changed.
Until this thing's cleared up,
I'm not about to resign.
Oh.
Now, will you tell the others?
Ask them to meet me here in my office,
7:30 tonight.
It's awfully short notice.
The committee can't just ignore what's happened.
I guess you're right.
Darling.
Ann, I'm sorry.
- I didn't mean to snap at you.
- Oh.
Now, why can't you resign?
Well, because...
Well, possibly something real, unreal...
I don't know....
Is waiting to kill one of us every time I jab a black pin into that map.
Bob, if you're talking about
Henry trowbridge, the poor man died of a heart attack.
Heart disease is the country's number one killer.
Maybe not in milford.
Oh, Bob, you can't mean that that map is literally killing people?
No, Ann, maybe it isn't the map.
Well...
What about the other day?
You saw me, you heard me...
"lunchtime, Annie.
I want you. I need you."
Bob, I was obviously trying to bring a little...
A little romance into our very dull and dismal lives.
No, Ann, don't try to deny it now.
I do deny it!
Bob, I love you. I'm...
I'm not in any sort of occult thrall to you.
Hey.
Can't you take a joke?
All right, then, i was lying, too.
Does that bring you back to reality again?
Bob?
I think we better take advantage of...
Of those plane tickets.
George's Mr. sanford could be best man.
The offer's awfully attractive.
I love you so much.
Ann, if you're gonna cry, do it someplace else.
Now, Bob, it's real simple.
We're willing to play ball with you.
If you want to remain chairman of this committee, we wouldn't think of trying to dissuade you, because we have confidence in you.
Full confidence.
All the confidence in the world, Bob.
Now, all we want before we break this up is a promise from you,
Mr. chairman, that before you turn in tonight, you'll go out to the cemetery...
Now, let me finish.
You'll go out there and change my white pin to black, and Charlie's and George's.
Just as simple as that.
And then go home and go right to bed.
No, sir.
You're not the committee, Bob.
You're only our chairman with a duty to carry out the will of the majority.
We feel that you should do as bill said, because it'll put an end to this business once and for all.
Otherwise, we'll do the resigning right here and now.
Well, let me sleep on it.
Let's all sleep on it.
I don't think you people realize what might be involved here.
Motion defeated, tonight.
Well, your devotion to the principle of majority rule moves me deeply.
Okay.
Then, good night.
All right, Charlie.
Here goes nothing, George.
Who is it?
It's me, Bobby.
Open up.
I seen your car lights from my window driving through the gate, so I come a runnin'.
You needn't have bothered, mckee.
You put in a full day already.
Now, I'll see you tomorrow.
No, no, no.
B... Bobby, please,
Bobby, listen.
When you locked and bolted this place,
I said to myself,
"now, there's a man who knows his business."
That's what I said.
"He may not know everything, what's behind it, but he knows when a thing's to be fooled with and when it's to be left alone."
"There's nothing to fear with a man like Bobby kraft at the wheel," that's what I said.
Well, that's fine.
Now, you run along home and don't worry about a thing.
Nothing's going to happen to you.
N... no. Please.
Bobby, lock this door again and send yourself home, or else, who can answer for what may happen to the whole miserable lot of us?
It'll have to be open sometime.
If I don't do it, they'll get somebody who will.
Now, good night, Andy.
Good night.
Andy, go home.
[Picks up phone 1
hello?
Ls this the immortal hills cemetery?
What do you want, Jess?
Bob?
Why didn't you answer me?
I've been looking all over town for you.
I'm calling from your place now.
What are you doing at the cottage again?
Haven't you had enough for one day?
Jess, I think I've done something terribly wrong.
For the love of Pete,
what are you talking about?
Well, we had a meeting of the cemetery committee after closing tonight.
Bill honegger, Charlie bates, and George, everybody.
And they voted to make me come out here to the cemetery and stick black pins in the map for each of them, just like it was some kid's nightmare.
So I did it.
Jess, there's a black pin in that map for Charlie bates and bill honegger and George.
And if anything happens to them, to any of them, it's my fault, nobody else's.
Nothing's going to happen to them, Bob.
As a matter of fact, I think they did you a big favor.
I've never heard of a coincidence
involving three people dying all at once.
By tomorrow at this time, this whole big worry of yours
will be nothing but a lot of hot air.
Yeah.
Well, I hope you're right, Jess.
I guess there's nothing for me to do but see this thing through, huh?
I think I'll check on 'em myself and see...
Bob?
Bob?
Honegger, bates, and George.
Six-six-six.
Desk.
Lieutenant clayborne, please.
Homicide.
This is homicide, sergeant greer.
Uh, lieutenant clayborne, please.
Not here.
Can I take a message?
Sergeant, uh, this is, uh, Bob kraft, kraft department store.
Oh, sure.
Wait a second.
Wait a second, and I'll check.
Uh, Mr. kraft, are you calling on police matters,
or is it just something personal?
Well, uh, it's a little bit of both, sergeant.
Try him at Adams, one-three-one-one.
Thank you.
Adams, one-three-one-one.
Adams, one-three-one-one.
Adams, one-three-one-one.
Bill honegger, Adams, one-three-one-one.
Adams one...
- Desk.
- Get me homicide.
Yes, sir.
Homicide.
This is Bob kraft speaking.
I can't get through to that Adams number.
So?
Clayborne's at that number, and it's imperative that I speak to him right now.
Well, sir, uh...
Just a second, sir.
I think he's reporting in on another line.
I've been trying get you, but your lines are busy.
Hang up, and I'll call you back right away.
Something happened to bill honegger?
Hello?
It's Jess, Bob.
Jess, uh, I'm expecting a call from clayborne.
He, uh... hang up, call me back in 10 minutes.
Clayborne's with me.
Let me talk to him.
He's not here now. He's...
What's wrong, Jess?
Bill honegger's dead.
Soon as I found out,
I routed clayborne out of the sack
and filled him in on the whole wild story.
We were over at honegger's in 10 minutes
with two squad cars detailed
to cover Charlie bates and your uncle.
How did honegger get it?
He didn't.
That's the trouble.
What?
Poor guy just dropped dead.
Nothing out of the ordinary?
Bates?
Charlie bates?
They found him in his apartment.
Say it.
No homicide.
Just stopped breathing.
George?
George, yeah...
I called and told him about honegger
before I left for clayborne's.
By the time the police got there,
George had already left.
Oh, they'll find him, Bob.
Don't worry.
I'll be waiting for word about George.
Let me know.
Well, Bob, I see you followed our wishes to the letter.
Come on, now.
I'll drive you home before you catch pneumonia.
You three men made a terrible contribution to this town tonight, whether you meant to or not.
I'm not going anywhere, uncle George.
I'm staying right here.
Well, I'll...
I'll admit that, uh...
What with, uh, Charlie and bill going so suddenly...
Charlie and bill and Henry and lsham and Beth and stu.
Stop looking at the map.
You're looking at it!
I'm looking at you.
And we're both waiting, aren't we, uncle George?
Waiting to see if you escape.
Escape dying?
Nobody escapes that, my boy.
The only question is how long?
The only question is does a man die in his own time or in the map's?
So far, everyone's been forced to conform to its schedule.
Everyone but you.
That puts me back on schedule.
My own schedule.
Well, if it makes you feel any better.
Let me tell you something...
From now on, if you want to see me, you're going to have to come down to the store.
I won't make another special trip on your account.
The next time i see you, George, we'll both be right here.
Desk.
Homicide.
Homicide.
This is Robert kraft out at immortal hills.
Clayborne speaking.
Lieutenant, my uncle just left here.
I think under the circumstances, the least you could do is put a man on to watch over him, no matter how ridiculous the situation seems to you.
Thanks a lot, Mr. kraft.
We'll take care of it right away.
He's wearing an overcoat over his robe and pajamas.
We put a description on the wire
quite some time ago.
Then, you do think there's danger.
Sergeant, kraft, George m.,
driving east on bunker hill.
Probable destination, manor apartments...
We'll have your uncle safe and sound
in 10 minutes, Mr. kraft.
You'll hear from me.
Are you sure your uncle was out there tonight?
You didn'tjust think you saw him?
I told you he just left here.
That was two hours ago and no sign of him anyplace.
I put out an all-points after the first hour.
He's not on the road, and he's not home.
Hold the wire, lieutenant.
You better come out, lieutenant.
He's still here.

Mckee, I'm gonna burn that stuff in the greenhouse if this heater doesn't work by tonight.
Bobby, it took a whole lifetime of collection for me to get the whole caboodle here.
And see here, you haven't even touched your food.
Man, you've got to eat if you want to keep above the ground.
Ah, lights for me, Bobby.
Of course, I cannot answer for what happens after sundown.
Better wait in the car.
Irresistible, huh?
Aren't I crazy?
Completely.
I'll never change, I'm afraid.
Annie, uh, I'll see you later?
Bob, please. I take it back.
What?
That day in the car...
I did see you, and I did hear you.
I really did.
I should never have denied it.
It's all right, Annie.
I'll see you later.
Do you have a party named Jacob mittel someplace on the map?
M- i-t-t-e-l.
The importer? Sure.
You know him?
Yeah.
We contact the French designers through mittel.
As a matter of fact, he's in Paris now.
Better strike him out.
Jay?
Go ahead.
How did he die?
He isn't dead.
At least, not yet.
I know what you're thinking,
Mr. kraft.
You're thinking that we tricked you into killing Jacob mittel.
Well, you're 100 percent right, so try to relax, huh?
This one's on the police.
You see, Jacob mittel's in the prime of life.
No previous major illnesses, no record, life expectancy exceptionally good.
He's in Paris with all that ocean water to protect him from this mess.
Up until now, all the deaths have been confined to the local area.
If it strikes somebody on another continent, then, we've really found something.
I knew I should have gotten rid of those pins four days ago.
Even the map.
The whole thing. Out!
What I want to know is what are you going to tell the district attorney is responsible for these deaths?
We gave this case a real full-dress investigation,
Mr. kraft.
Questioned you and all the other suspects and witnesses until the point of comedy.
Found nothing. No motive, no opportunity, no suspect, no crime, no weapon.
Except seven pins went in...
And the seven people died.
Not one... seven.
Who put in those pins?
You did. All seven.
Other chairmen and so on have been putting pins in that map for years and nothing happened.
But... with me...
It isn't impossible for a certain kind of man to be endowed with powers that nobody had ever dreamed he could have.
A lot of scientists claim that.
Maps and pins can't kill alone, the power of a human brain has to be behind them.
Like in the indies, I guess.
Those voodoo dolls you hear about.
Witch doctor sticks pins in the thing until the guy in question is jinxed into dying.
Of course, i...
I know you didn't mean to kill anybody.
I have to get back.
You'll hear from me the minute we get word.
I think I best be running along, too.
Bob...
I think so.
I destroyed them.
Something in me killed them.
Something in me...
But i... I couldn't refuse the job.
[ Scoffs 1 not a man with my reasoning power.
Power...
If I have the power of death using the black pins...
Then I must have the power of life using the white ones.
[ Rumbling 1
[ rumbling 1 this is the cemetery.
That's right.
This is rosemond mittel.
Rosemond, I don't... yes.
Can't you hear me?
This is rosemond mittel,
Jay's wife.
Rosemond. Yes.
I... just received a cable, Bob.
Can't you hear me?
You just received a cable from Paris, France.
That's right.
I'll read it again.
"Regret to inform you,
Jacob w. Mittel died in...
Hotel royale."
"Body awaits disposition."
"Signed, American embassy,
Paris, France."
That's right.
He died there.
Died in Paris, France.
Died.
Jacob w. Mittel.
Impossible.
Impossible.
He cannot be dead.
What? What?
You still think that thing's the killer?
Or your own puny power,
Mr. chairman?
The only power you or that map ever had was me, so as far as killing goes...
You... you marked them for death, Mr. chairman, but who did the deed?
Andrew mckee.
Oh, Andy, why?
You and your high and mighty committee, turning out a man with 40 years of service on the grounds.
40 years.
I told you, Andy, a full pension.
It isn't a cash that keeps a man going, lad, what keeps his feet on the ground, and keeps him on the job till the lord makes him quit.
The lord...
But nobody else.
This is my house, my lands, my activities.
Aye, we come a long dark road to put this gun to your head, Bob.
Andy, we never tried to take anything away from you.
Aye. I made sure of that.
I snuck up on each one of them in turn when they was alone and held them fast, like so, until they went.
Aye, even big old George, your uncle, left as easy as a baby.
Mittel?
That doesn't explain what happened to mittel.
Mittel's dead.
Will you stop that confounded talk, man?
That map's naught but a doodad, you fool.
There's nothing to fear here.
That map.
Andy, talk about something else, quick.
It's important.
You're finished with talking.
Finished you are, with maps, and pins...
Black and white.
Talk about something else, i said.
It's important.
Right now.
Talk about anything else.
Now!
Why?
Because I caused you to kill those people.
Andy, you better get this straight right now.
You heard that lieutenant.
It's possible for some people to have things inside them that make other things happen.
Nothing is impossible for a man like that if he thinks about it hard enough.
I know you, Andy...
You're no killer.
I made you do it.
You thought me into killing them?
Then they could all be back.
Andy, I never knew it.
How do you account for that?
That noise.
Can't you hear it?
Andy. Andy, stop.
There's nobody.
They could all be back.
They could all be back.
510p-
kraft,
don't let them get inside.
They're coming.
You shouldn't have stuck in them white pins, Bobby,
but now it's too late.
Too late.
I only killed five.
You gave me only five.
Not the young drexel couple.
Go away. Go away.
Leave me alone.
Go away. Go.
Save me, Bobby.
He's dead, lieutenant.
All right, forget the normal procedure.
Get him out of here.
Exhibit a.
He really didn't need it.
They died of fright first, just like he did.
You're forgetting about those seven trips to the mausoleum, lieutenant.
Seven bodies, seven trips.
They helped.
Lieutenant, uh...
Jacob mittel, uh, died in Paris?
No, that was a plant, Mr. kraft.
Mittel's all right.
Sorry we had to put you through this, but it was the best way to make mckee come out in the open.
Uh, Mrs. mittel stayed up all night at headquarters waiting for us to call in.
Our radio car is posted just outside.
We signaled her to phone you and tell you that lie about her husband.
Am I getting through to you, Mr. kraft?
Well, not quite yet.
We watched him, Bob.
He actually managed to...
Unearth all seven of them.
Wonder what got into him.
It was those white pins.
It was.
Oh.
- Annie, I've lost my overcoat.
- Hmm?
Oh, where?
Which one?
I'll get it.
No, never mind.
I think I can find it myself.

Now is not the time. Soon a heavy snowstorm will come.
And the valleys will be dangerous.
- Oh.
Take what is there. Take what you need.
But these are four medicines.
We have a great stash of all these herbs.
-You can really spear them?
Take what you wish, now, so will have every spec...
- Species?
- Species.
It's a long time since
I have studied your language.
The Research Foundation will be greatly in your debt, sir.
Mr. Fox, you do not drink your tea?
-Oh, I do, well, I mean I will.
I think I'm going to like some jars to put these in.
-It will be cold.
-Well, really, I quite like it cold.
Excuse me.
Mr. Fox doesn't enjoy tea made in our fashion.
To him I think it still seems a bit greasy and unpleasant.
- But you?
- I've come to enjoy it.
- And your wife?
She also enjoys it?
-Well, she's working on it.
- Well, she's a brave person to come here at all.
She can't be comforted in those poor quarters I have provided..
This is a hard, rough place built for men.
-You've been very good to us, sir.
-Tell me, Dr. Rollason...
You are content with this land, these people, our customs?
-I think so.
I know the Himalayans very well through climbing and now this work.
- You're a climber, to the great peaks.
-I was.
But I had an accident, a stupid one, but a bad one, so I gave it up.
And now your wife comes with you to make sure of that?
- Helen comes with me as a colleague.
We work together.
And the other party, who's coming,
How long have you waited?
-They are six days overdue.
- Your wife, Dr. Rollison, she knows they're coming?
Coming to help you with your work?
-Of course.
But there will be little left to do, now that your work is almost completed.
-They'll want to see things for themselves.
You permit?
These other men were also sent by your foundation, or are they not?
They're not.
-Do you know something about them?
-I know they will be here tonight.
I have sent guides to meet them.
You're not pleased?
Of course, this is wonderful news, but I had no idea they'd been see.
- They have not been seen, but they will be here in a few hours.
-Helen.
- Yes?
- Specimen jars.
The old boy's just made us a present.
A pick of his collection of dried plants.
-That's wonderful, Foxy. Does John know?
Well, he's over there now, waiting for jars.
-And why this sudden generosity.
- I do not know.
They've got to get rid of us.
And so I'm ready... the sooner we get out of here, out of this infernal country with its cold and bad smell,
And the superstitions...
- Take it easy, Foxy, take it easy.
From the misery and ignorance, and this awful, cold,
-And the Tibetan tea.
- Say, are you busy?
- Just a few diagrams to finish, why?
Will you be an angel and take these over to John for me, will you?
Yes.
- now I can get on with the re indexing of the new specimen.
- Here it is.
- Foxy?
- I have another arm.
- Of course. Sorry.
I hope that I can get a few more details about these.
The possible elevation in which they can be found...
- Dr. Rollason, what do you know about those men that are coming?
-Know about them?
Not very much. I have a message from them suggesting we meet here.
- From their leader, a man named
Friend?
- That's right, Tom Friend.
You've heard of him?
- He passed these ways before some months ago.
But he did not come to me, as is his custom,
- Perhaps he did not wish to pester you.
-And now he returns.
What is this man searching for?
- Before I can say that,
I must have a talk to him.
-You can say now.
Dr. Rollason, why do you want to help these people?
I suppose for the pursuit of knowledge.
-Whose knowledge? Yours alone?
-All of human knowledge.
-Human knowledge?
Is that reason enough?
I'm afraid we're taking your time, sir.
I don't know what's happened to Fox.
-He is not coming. She is.
Your wife. She's approaching now.
- But how do you know?
- I've been hearing.
-Is that all, sir?
Here I have developed the senses. All of them.
There's time for the learners of many things.
Have you not found it so?
Come in. You're welcome, my dear lady.
- Thank you.
- Foxy told me to bring you this.
- Oh, yes thank you. We have been presented with some remarkable new specimen.
- I know, Foxy told me.
-We have not met many times, Mrs. Rollason.
-No, no we haven't.
I was talking a lot to your husband, but not to you.
I'm sorry, I've had quite a lot of work to do.
I have been concerned for your comfort but your husband reassured me.
- Of course. I bet we put you to a lot of inconvenience.
- You are welcome to remain under my protection while her husband is on his climbing expedition.
- Climbing?
- To the peaks.
Now, unfortunately my duties make this meeting all so short and...
I must leave you now.
- What climbing expedition, John?
- That was deliberate.
I guess I hadn't told.
- Why don't you tell me now?
Helen, I was going to explain to you before, but they may not have turned up.
-They?
-It's a party led by a man named Friend.
They should be here in a few hours.
- And you have arranged to go with them?
-Provisionally.
Oh, Helen, please, please.
There was no point in talking about it before. I haven't even told Foxy.
- Thanks, it's nice to be back to "Together".
- You know I didn't mean that,.
- What about the Botanical Foundation?
Have you kept them in the dark, too? - This has nothing to do with the Foundation.
Only that they financed this year and they are waiting for our report...
And we are already behind schedule.
- Yes, I know that.
Without it being all about loyalty,
Don't you think we ought to get on with it?
- Helen, please try and understand.
-I am trying.
But at this time of year with the fresh snow falling to go peak climbing, just to...
-But they might not even arrive.
- Why did we come up here, John?
- Why?
-Right up here so out of the way?
It wasn't just to search for rare plants, was it?
Was it, John?
- No - I've had my eye on you.
I kept remembering the things you wrote once.
But I said nothing. I didn’t want to remind you. - What I wrote?
-I'd hoped you'd forgotten.
- Your theories about the high valleys, about what might be there...
- Listen, darling. You're getting upset about something that might not even happen.
- I don't want anything to do with it.
I can't bear it, John!
I don't want you to get into danger.
Into the mountains to look for this creature.
What's all this event of?
Oh, it's just one of their regular ceremonies.
- You think they've chosen tonight on purpose?
- Maybe.
- Hey, come inside and shut the door.
How do you expect to have anything hot if the wall's hot?
How's it coning?
I think it may be enough for an extra four.
-Maybe even more!
- Hey, you're not going to ask me to feed his porters, too, are you?
- It will be an awful waste of food if they don't.
-You know something, Foxy?
Nothing would give me more pleasure than to have to waste it.
-They're here.
-Let me know how many.
- You the head man here
Do you speak English?
Where is our guide? Hey, Kusang!
-He's bringing up the rear.
Do you know Dr. Rollason?
- Rollason!
-Tom Friend.
-Oh hi.
- Hey, Kusang!
- I'm here, Mister.
- Get the storage under cover, take care of the ponies.
- Is this in our honor?
- I don't know.
- Hey Jock, stick close.
These guys eat you.
Mr. Friend, I am very glad to meet you.
Mr. Rollason, I presume.
It's a great honor.
- What was giving you up?
- We ran into a little bit of bad weather.
- We happen to think that you've been gone.
- This is Ed Shelley.
Mr. Shelley. - Hi.
-Jock, our photographer.
- How do you do?
- And this is Peter Fox, my assistant.
- I hope you're all hungry.
There is a banquet upstairs.
- Beef stew.
Leave me to it, I could eat a yak.
- I'd better warn you about Ed's table manners.
- Oh, and this is my wife Helen.
Tom Friend, Mr. Shelley and Andrew...
Andrew McNee. -Sorry.
- How do you do? I have four portions between the three of you, so come on up everybody.
-I take your word, ma'am.
Come on, Jock.
This is home cooking.
- You didn't tell me about your wife.
- We always work together.
Hardly a trip for a woman.
No, she stays here with
Fox, I already fixed that.
- Fine.
- If I come.
-If you come?
Dr. Rollason, this is the... this is the expedition that's not gonna fail.
We're gonna find that creature they call the Yeti.
No.
Yes.
Can we stable under there, under your living corners.
-I told you it was built for.
-Kusang!
- We covered a lot of miles today. How many, Tom?
- About ten...
- Ten?! My feet said about a hundred.
I rolled the rockiest tracks in this stinking country.
Thank you.
- Ed here objects to the primitive.
- Come on, move over.
-Primitive?
I don't know what's worse about it,
The stink of everything.
Or the ignorant natives, or the filthy food they eat or what.
You tell me.
- I find this country attractive.
- Attractive?
-Oh, come on, Ed, knock it off, will you?
- Oh, even what we'll look for is abominable.
That's what they call it, isn't it?
The abominable snowman?
- It doesn't exist.
- Helen.
You don't subscribe to your husband's theories, Mrs. Rollason?
- No.
- And about what this creature might be?
- No, I don't.
- Neither do I.
-Well, skeptics right in camp back here.
When the whole evidence there is based on a few footprints in the snow.
Have you ever seen these footprints, Mr. Fox?
-I have not.
-I have.
-Where?
In Drolambao glacier.
With a climbing party, two yeas ago.
I found a line of... fresh footprints like human ones, only bigger and far broader.
-You didn't see what made it?
I followed them for a mile or so and then they finished in a bare rock face.
It was... it was just long enough to get a sense of what I might be tracking.
- You are an impressionable man,
Mr. McNee.
Well, this is a sort of impression you won't forget.
- Alson, there have been photographs, Mrs. Rollason.
1951 Shipton expedition took pictures of similar footprints.
They were published by the Times.
- They could be made by a bear.
-But they weren't.
- Look, in your message, you said something about having special evidence.
So this seems like a good time to produce it.
- This came into my possession a short time ago.
Solid silver.
Native craftsmanship.
If you can see what it says around there, translate it.
-The protection of the great...
No, something like... powerful...
The powerful beings is besought.
At the land of Rong-ruk.
- This monastery?
- That's right.
It was stolen from here some years ago by a German explorer.
The powerful beings probably means local gods.
-Now watch.
The ornamentation hides the join, but it finally does unscrew and you see.
-A tooth!
In the Middle Ages it was a usual thing to preserve bits tooth and bones in the bodies of saints.
That's what that is.
A relic. Of course you know more about that, Doctor.
-It's unbelievable.
The size of it!
- It seems to be genuine.
- It is. I had it sectioned and tested.
- It's like the canine tooth of an ape, a gorilla.
- Yes, but it's about three times as big.
- Let me see.
- I read your views, doctor, about the possible size and bone structure of these creatures.
- That would fit, wouldn't it?
- Yes, it would, but it's not a fossil.
-It's living ivory.
-What is this, a war dance?
- These people are Buddhists, they don't believe in war.
- Holy men doing a holy dance. Hey, this is good. Jock, take a picture.
-They don't allow it.
- Are you sure they don't mean trouble?
- You can take my word for it.
-Well, I hope you're right.
I got no responsibility over where my porters' lives are.
- Their religion prevents them from harming anyone or anything.
- Okay, just so they know it.
How about some more stew?
- Just a minute, did I hear right?
You're not taking the porters with you?
- Not beyond this point.
- You're doing this climb alone?
- Yes, just the five of us.
- You're mad.
-You better tell your plan.
Well, so far no expedition ever got even near this thing they call a Yeti.
You know why?
Because they were tramping up the peaks with 50, or 60 porters behind them like an invading army.
It's enough to scare any living creature.
We don't want that.
So it will be just the five of us.
- On what do we live? On vitamin pills?
-Tell him Tom.
- We've been up here before,
Ed and I, last summer.
-Yes, I heard that.
- Took fifty men loaded up to the limit up to the north valley.
Saw to the way supplies and stored them in places where they would be safe from the snow/.
Rock caves and so on, all on the route.
- And you think these supplies will still be there with fifty men sharing this secret?
- They don't. We took turns.
One of them marched them on while the others stayed behind and hid the the batch that they had just unloaded.
Single handed. It was murder, but we did it.
-The north valley.
- It's the steepest and crookedest and blocked by the worst ice you've ever seen.
-like the mountains of the moon!
If I were a creature who wanted to lurk away from humanity, that's where I'd lurk.
- John, this is completely irresponsible.
Without porter and without a guide.
- Correction, ma'am, we're taking along one local guide.
Kusang, you saw him down below.
- One Guide. And how did he qualify for this unique position?
-Because he's seen a Yeti, ma'am.
-He's seen one?
-This is the time to do it, doc. Winter.
The heavy snow's forced anything up that valley down for food.
- Yes, but...
- It's gonna be tough going, we know that.
We're gonna need an expert climber.
And a double capacity.
We need you with us. What to you say, doc?
-Yes, John, what do you say?
- Id like to show this to someone first.
- Who's that?
- The person who seems to be its rightful owner. The Lhama.
- Whenever you say.
- Now.
- Keep the food hot.
- I'll come, too.
- How long is this war?
- Sometimes for several hours.
-Put that away, John.
-Yes, I know this.
It was taken from here many years ago.
However you came by it, Mr.
Friend I'm grateful.
You return it now.
I happen to do so, sir.
You... you know it opens, then?
-The carved tooth.
-Carved?
It was made according to what I heard by monks a far distant time.
It was meant to be a tooth the god Manjushri, the all powerful.
-Made?
Did you think it was a real tooth?
- We thought perhaps it was.....
- You men of the west.
You are driven by curiosity.
You would risk your lives in the rains and ice and coldness to search for this...
- "Animal".
- He's known all the time.
-This animal you only imagine to exist.
-You also think it doesn't exist?
Dr. Rollason, you've made no contract.
You are under no obligation to go up there with us tomorrow.
But we're going.
And if it's humanly possible, will find this creature.
-I'll come.
-Don't worry. He'll be alright.
We'll look after him, he'll be just...
I have my party and myself, but thank you for your hospitality.
-Small return, Mr. Friend, for this.
Okay, emergencies knapsacks pack and checked.
- What's next?
- Climbing irons.
Kusang's getting them.
Kusang, where are you?
Watch these guys.
They got a greedy look.
- I do not think...
- Just watch them, that's all.
Come on. Give me that.
Hey Kusang, did you talk to the other porters?
Yes, mister. They want pay now.
They'll get paid when we get back.
- How come we only got three packs?
- Rollason says he's got his own gear.
- Goodbye Foxy. Look after her.
- I will.
- See you soon.
-Well, I better get back to that report.
-Foxy disapproves.
You'd Better bring us together again.
- I thought we said...
- I know, John.
But it's those men, Friend and Shelley,
I don't trust them, I don't like them.
- You're doing storm in a glass of water.
- No, I feel it, John.
Listen, Friend talks too much, agreed, and Shelley could use a few manners...
- I snore. They will be the ones to suffer.
- Don't joke about it, John.
- Helen, darling,
Look, you do understand.
I've written and talked enough about it.
And now I've got the chance to put it all to the test. I have to take it, haven't I?
Come on, now, give me a hand with this.
John, for the last time
I’m asking you, don't go.
-Look, darling...
You won't come back, I know it.
I'll never see you again.
Hey Doc! Kusang!
Come on, we got to move.
- Be careful, my darling.
Be careful.
- I can take look after myself.
You know that.
Rollason!
Kusang! Let's go!
Hey Tom, wait a minute.
We've got to keep this pace up?
We've got to make that hut before nightfall.
We went an easier way last time, over those ridges.
-This time of year, they're all snowed up.
- Yeah? Look at those guys.
They seem to be doing alright.
Yeah, well, they're not going where we're going.
- You all right, Doc?
- So far.
-Well, let's keep moving. Nice and steady.
Get a rhythm, maybe you ought to sing her something.
Yeah, you do that. Sing!
♫ John Brown's Body... ♫
-Oh, come on. Sing.
- Save your breaths, will you?
- We're making good time, ain't we?
-Yeah, but wait until we start to climb.
- Come on, Ed. We got to keep this pace up.
-Why pick on me? What about limp foot?
- Well, him I can do without,
You I need.
- Stop bickering, We've got less than two hours till sunset. We've got to be in a safe campsite by then.
-When we get to the hut, we'll be all right.
-Where exactly is this hut?
-Over that ridge.
-There's another rough weather coming up, we'll never make it in time, unless...
- There is a shortcut.
- Where?
- Across the column, on that side.
- It looks awfully steep.
-Oh, let's give it a try.
You're the prized climber in this party, Doc. Why don't you take over?
-Alright, everybody wrap up immediately.
Kusang rope.
- It will be a short, sharp climb.
- So long as it's short.
-Fairly short, it will be easy as hell. You will be in minimum positions for safety.
-I like safety, too, Doc.
-We'll be alright if we keep our minds in what we're doing.
-Alright, let's get roped up and get on with it.
- Kusang, you first.
-How's it going, Doc? Come on, Ed.
-Ok, we're coming!
Hey, Jock.
Spread out.
Don't crowd 'em!
Avalanche!
What happened? -Uh, nothing. Just some little stuff came down.
For a minute there, I thought we had an avalanche starting.
-And It might have been it, with him yelling like that.
- You're crazy!
- No, he isn't.
A sharp sound, a sudden vibration is all it takes..
Let's have no more shouting unless it's vital.
Right, You got that, Ed?
- Okay, okay.
- Come on, let's go.
-There it is, the hut.
-Oh, there's nothing else  here, Tom.
It was all sealed in these containers.
- Fill the hole up again.
- Fill it up?
They will be up this spring and will think that the earth devils have been here.
-Go ahead and fill it up, or want to scare do you want to scare these poor natives to death?
- You are a civilized man.
- Alright, tomorrow.
If this is the way you planned the rest of our trip a caution is out of the call.
-You wouldn't get a meal like this out of an emergency pack.
- Who's for more?
- Not for me, thanks.
I thought altitude was supposed to make you hungry.
Kusang!
-You talk about this as if it were a joke.
-Have you seriously considered what might happen?
-Look, Doc, I've been running into people all my life
Who'd cried off because of what might happen "if".
I went ahead and did it.
Now for some facts: I've got some real supplies cashed up ahead.
This was just a snack on the way up.
-What else have you
 got cashed away besides food?
-Everything we need, from tents, to fuel.
Look, 18, 000 feet.
We'll stop, make our first camp, and search at the foot of the ice wall.
20,000 feet the same procedure, and then again at 22,000.
And we've got oxygen if
 we want to go higher.
We've got everything we need to get up above above this creature.
Search it out in its own ground and track it down.
Now, how about some more of your contribution?
- Oh, such as?
- Expert advice.
Let's know the nature of the enemy.
What's it live on?
Of small animals. Hares, mice, those.
But we've seen none.
We don't see them, but he's right, they’re there
- Carnivorous, then, huh?
- No, they needn't be.
There are roots and plants under the snow.
It's probably adaptable like man.
-Man? What you're suggesting roughly is that this may be some kind of a missing link?
-That's a bit too rough.
Say parallel development.
-Not with you.
-Parallel with mankind?
-We are not far north of India.
Now, some millions of years that was a breeding ground of huge ape-like animals.
Primitive anthropoids, their possible bones are dug up from time to time.
Now, the latest evolutionary theory is
The very same has branched off in two directions,
One to become the great apes, chimpanzees, orangutan, and so on,
And the other man.
-Darwin's theory all tidied up. So?
Will, suppose...
Suppose there were a third line of descent.
-The Anthropoid X.
As different from man as the apes are.
-Probably.
-This calls for very fancy guesswork.
But what would have happened to them?
-Gradual extinction through change of conditions and enemies.
-Might include both apes and men,
-Most likely it did, though only a remnant survived.
Adapting themselves to living where nothing else would. In these mountains.
The highest in the world, and above the snow line.
-There's no proof of all this.
-Oh, not yet, but a hundred years ago there was no proof that primitive men had ever existed, either.
-Look, how do you see it? I mean, it walks on two legs.
-There's no doubt
 about that. The tracks prove it.
They show a foot 13 inches
30 cm long and very wide indeed.
The stride of a six foot man, yet his legs would be far more massive and short in proportion to his height.
-Now, you see what that implies?
- It's big.
Perhaps 7 or 8 feet high?
- What do you think, Ed?
-You know, can try.
- Go on, drag it out. Good a time as any.
- I'm not with you.
-Oh, me might as well let you in our little secret.
The fact of the matter is that
Ed here is an expert trapper.
-Yeah, everything from foxes to grizzlies.
Now, this is a tungsten steel net, it's just a little sample.
-Do you think it will hold it?
-Oh, if not, we have
 other things up there.
-What things? More guns?
-So that's what this is.
A hunting party.
-Well, what did you expect us to do?
Look at it through a telescope?
And Jock here take a picture?
You said this was a research party investigation.
It is, bonafide, and I want one alive, and so do you.
- And what is your interest, commercial?
- And if they are, they're ours/
-Then why all the secrecy?
-For a thing just like this.
Outraged indignation.
- I wanted to be well under away before...
-Listen...
- Listen!
- What is it?
-I was certain I heard something, but you were talking so loudly.
- Outside?
- What?
-A sort of cry.
- You see anything?
- Keep your voices down.
- Over there. Snow man mark.
- Are you sure?
Quiet!
- No, it's nothing.
- But I'm sure I heard something.
-Any the rest of you heard anything?
- Kusang?
- No, no...
It's false alarm.
-Jock, you need some sleep.
We all do. Come on..
I'm sorry I broke out at you like that just now.
-We're all a bit on edge. may be the altitude.
-Yeah, but I think I ought to explain.
Frankly I'm here as a commercial venture, but
I don't think that cheapens my motives in any way. - And what's at the end of the line?
- A circus? A zoo?
- No, neither.
Thanks.
- Look.
I'm not exactly a golden character, Doc.
After the war I did a little smuggling around on the coast of Europe. hard gun for the angry little countries.
I lived on the two basic drives of humanity: Fear and hunger.
When they began to dry up on me,
I looked around for another one.
On curiosity, human curiosity.
Funny thing. Ever think about it?
-I suppose I suffered under it.
The world is full receptive, inquisitive people...
People who are informed, responsive to new ideas.
The radio and television, films, these things have gone in to the very homes of people
And stirred up a healthy curiosity about the earth that they live on.
These are the people I work for.
If I can I'm gonna bring them one of these creatures...
They can learn and profit from it.
-You really believe all that?
-Sure I do, Doc.
They give the world a whole new concept.
A new slam on humanity,
Help us to know and understand ourselves better.
Don't you think that's important?
-You'd appear with this creature?
Show it on television?
-All the means, I'll use them.
Look, don't you understand?
Dr. Rollason, writing little boring book in the corner... isn't enough anymore. it's a new age of awareness.
It's a big age. You got to measure up to it, Doc.
-You better get some sleep.
You got an early start.
-Yeah, well, you think about it.
-I can not understand them.
-Foxy! Foxy!
-Come on, get inside.
Now, what's the matter?
All right. You get paid when Sahib comes back.
Now shut up!
Now go on, go on.
It's alright, they're only Friend's porters. Apparently they haven't been paid. they gave you a bit of a shock, huh?
Now, you sit down there, have a spot of this, you'll feel much better.
-Why do you suppose he didn't pay them, Foxy?
-Oh, just to make sure they're here when he comes back.
It's customary and reasonable.
Then why did they suddenly behave like that?
-Well, you know how they are, when they got nothing to do they... they stand about and chat for an hour, give them work themselves out...
Drink this.
- What's that?
- What do you mean?
- It's as if they knew something.
-As if they knew Friend wasn't coming back.
- Now, Helen...
Or John, or any of the party. They're going to die and everybody knows it.
-Now, stop it, Helen,
You're talking raving nonsense.
Now, come on, drink this.
You didn't sleep last night, did you? make sure you do, if not, take some tablets.
-I stayed the whole night just thinking...
I never felt so lonely.
Just heard from time to time the gong and the wind.
Foxy, you know these things these people believe in.
Clairvoyance? Thought transference?
- Sham magic.
- Is it sham?
Helen, this country is rotten with superstitions.
It’s only dangerous because we are surrounded by people who think it's real.
We can slide into thinking it's real to.
Now, come on, drink it
 up. You'll feel much better.
Make sure you're not pursued by the lads of the village again.
I think I'm going to have
 a word with the llama.
- It's a good idea, I need to...
- You stay right there.
And if you should feel
like another nip of that... nobody's going to call you a tippler.
-Sir?
Is anyone there?
Sir?
Sir?
- They're particularly out of sight.
- Yes, they are going well, too.
- How much longer will this take?
- I found what I wanted.
-Evidence of possible food supplies.
A type of moss, highly nutritious.
- You mean it's food?
- It might be.
Look, let's go on.
I don't want that swine to get too far out of sight.
- You don't trust him?
- Tom Friend? No more than you do.
-You're not a very good climber, either.
Why did you come on this trip, McNee?
-I had to.
-You had to?
Ever since that time, two years ago,
I...I felt that this what I must do. it's a..
.it's a sort of obsession.
Perhaps a psychologist could explain it; I don't know.
All I know is I've got to find the thing.
Getting hint of the fall this whetted your appetite.
It's all that matters.
- I...
I...I applied to join all sorts of climbing expeditions...
Hoping I'd be able, but
I was turned down, every time!
-Then you heard about the Tom Friend expedition.
-He wasn't so particular.
I...I paid him to let me come.
-You paid him?
-I...I can be useful, I'm good with the camera.
-But not good with an ice axe, and men like you could be dangerous
-No, I'll try not to be.
-Come on.
-Hello!
-Friend! Where are you?
-He said pitched camp at the ice wall.
-We're right at the middle of it now.
They can't be far away.
Hello!
-Wait a minute.
I thought I heard something.
Voices.
Ahead of us..
Are you there?
-Hello!
A trap. A steel trap.
-Get it open! Try!
I can't. It passed onto the rock.
-Hey, don't smash that!
Is valuable.
Here, here, let me do that.
- Did you set this?
- What do you think?
-Without warning us?
-You wanted me to put
 a flag on it, or something?
And I knew he was coming this way.
-Get him!
-Okay, get your foot out.
-He's down her path.
-This is why my improvement of the bear trap. Digs deep but doesn't tear.
-It didn't even bite through the boot!
-Oh the idiotic, manic ideas.
What did you want to achieve setting this trap?
-We've achieved it. before you blow your top, Doc, listen.
- It worked.
- What?
-We caught one of those things.
You don't believe me?
Well, come and look.
-Watch out. It's ice up here.
- Give me a hand.
- Here.
-We found these little trace, see?
So I set traps on the chance that whoever made them might come back.
- Little tracks?
- Yeah. You wait and see.
- Hey, Tom, they're here.
- Good.
Kusang. Pull it tighter.
Pull me that top one.
-Oh, finally made it, huh?
We couldn't wait on you.
There it is.
-Not very big, is it, Doc?
-Not more than four feet high.
But Kusang has no doubts.
- Kusang tell what it is.
- Yeti.
- The same as you saw before?
- Same.
- Like that?
- Same.
That's the expert, Doc.
I guess maybe we might have made a mistake ,huh?
Let's get it covered.
-Let it go.
- What do you mean, "Let it go"?
- Is a langur, a monkey Himalayas.
You'll find him in all the zoos in the world.
-Kusang said...
-Forget about Kusang, he's never seen the creature we're looking for.
-Yeti. Yeti.
-Knock it off will you? All your little trapping's done is defected one of our men.
- Doc?
- Yeah, he just happened to fall into one.
- Where can I treat him? In here?
-No, that's just our supply.
Let's take him over to the tent.
- Come on, Jock.
- Come on with me.
-You'll be alright.
-Steady, now.
-Kusang, tie him down.
-How is it?
-Apart from the bleeding, maybe a cracked bone...
But without an x-ray I can't tell.
-Does it hurt?
-Hey, are you sure you got the right station on?
-It should be.
-I fixed it. Waiting to see if they give us a weather forecast, Doc.
And now short weather forecast in English for Himalayan climbing party.
First the Tom Friend expedition in western Himalayas.
You may expect occasional snow storms...
Rising to blizzard force by tomorrow night.
Further outlook heavy snow continuing.
Next, Devon expedition in eastern part of the Himalayas...
- Blizzard. That's all we need.
- We've got 24 hours.
-This man can not march tomorrow.
 It's out of the question.
- Tom, we'll dig out the sledge.
- You've got a sledge?
Yeah...-Yeah, but it's not for him.
So what's it for, then?
Listen, Doc, this expedition cost a lot of money...
And I'm not going back empty-handed.
That animal we got in the cage out there, you say it was some kind of a monkey...
- Of course it was.
- Well, that's mysterious Yeti... or snow man, we proved that.
 Kusang here confirms it.
Meaning?
Meaning that from now on, we sell that fact.
I got to get that brute down to India. That particular, verified specimen of the Yeti.
- Sales promotion.
- I can do it, I know how to handle it.
- Sure, Tom, like with Francini that time.
- Shut up!
-Francini case?
Were you mixed up in that?
-He doesn't know what he's talking about.
-There is no Tome Friend in it if I remember .
How long have you used that name?
-I use what name I like.
Just what case do you think you're talking about?
-The Indian wolf tomb.
That he did live by wolves in the jungle.
Alright...
But after a while turned out to be plain well mental detectives.
-Alright, that's what the people wanted.
-Another new concept of humanity.
-You're nothing but a cheap trickster.
Shut your damn mouth!
-Watch it! The radio!
-Shut up!
-Well, that's taken care
 of the weather forecast.
-It's the altitude, right?
-I don't know. it makes you lose control.
-I'm so...I'm sorry, Doc.
- Forget it...
-How do you feel, McNee?
McNee?
- What does he have?
- Hush! Listen!
The cage.
Give me the torches. Careful.
Bring some flares.
-Yeah.
Come on, we may need you.
-Look at the cage, is all twisted.
-He's gone. He's got away.
And the door, it's all etched off.
-I just don't understand this.
-Let's see...she if we can figure out the tracks.
- Oh, the snow's all trampled about.
- Hey, watch this.
-Look, there's his track.
Hey, look at that.
They're two different kinds.
- Look at the size of it!
- 15, 16 inches long.
There is no doubt about it, there was something else out here, too.
-Put out that torch out.
-Yeah. What are we going to do?
Try to follow it?
Kusang, get the rifles, quick!
Kusang, run, get the rifles!
- What was that?
- Light the torch!
-There's something by the tent!
-Kusang.
-Kusang, what was it?
It was you that yelled us? Kusang!
-Hey, Tom, look!
Those big tracks all around you.
-McNee.
McNee.
- Are you alright?
- What was it?
- Is he okay?
- I don't know.
Give me your gun a
Nd some of those spears. Come on!
- Enough?
- Yeah!
-What did it look like? What did you see? Kusang, tell me.
-I see...I see... what...what man must not see.
I see true Yeti.
- Kusang.
- You made me see!
-Kusang!
Kusang!
Come back, Kusang!
Kusang! Come back!
Kusang!
- Find him?
- No, but I found something else.
- What's that?
- One of your traps all broken up apart.
Come on.
-Alright. Any sign of Kusang?
-No. You can bet he's
 headed back home by now.
Going down, it will only take him a few hours.
- He was out of his mind.
-Yeah, well, he had good cause if he saw what did this.
With this and those footprints we should get a pretty good idea the weight of the thing that made it.
-Looks like you were right Doc.
-Okay, but don't forget
 the vital part.
This creature may have an affinity of a man. Something in common with ourselves.
-Just remember that, before we start shooting.
-Sure, sure.
- Hey, is he getting delirious?
- I'm afraid so.
-You took care of his ankle.
-I did what I could, but this here is no hospital. That's where you ought to be.
- Oh, give another set of dope.
- No, that's enough.
-Alright, McNee, alright.
Go to sleep, old boy.
You're fine. Did you hear
 what I said, McNee?
- He's almost in a condition of trance.
- Trance?
-This is the way I thought of the thing being here.
-What are you getting at?
-I'm not sure.
-You mean he's affected
 by him in some way?
It's not impossible. If he were hypersensitive to their presence.
-Their presence?
When it gets like this they might be close?
It's only a wild guess.
- McNee, McNee
-The eyes...
-Mcnee
- He's in a complete state of trance.
McNee, can you understand me?
Can you hear me, McNee?
-His pulse.
-Tom, I think... there's something out there on the ice..
I got it, Tom! I got it!
-Careful, Tom.
-He's dead.
So that's it.
Really it.
Abominable Snowman.
-The size of that body!
-Looks like you underestimated, doc!
Must be ten feet.
Could be eleven feet high.
-Yeah.
-There's more of them!
-They know.
-First we've got to get this thing back to camp.
Us three will be able to manage.
Ed, go get the sledge and give me the gun.
-Right.
-Foxy!
Foxy, wake up.
-What's the matter?
- The poser has come back!
- The poser?
-The one they took with them.
The man named Kusang.
-You must be dreaming!
-No, I'm not. I saw him in the courtyard.
He seemed exhausted and could hardly stand up.
He's not there now.
They took him away.
He was there, Foxy.
They took him to that door.
I've got to know what this means.
-Helen, for heaven's sakes.
- I'm going to see the Lhama
- Helen, calm.
- Helen, you never see
 him at this hour. You...
-Drink this, drink it.
You've been frightened.
One of my servants found you wandering in the secret part of the building.
I was looking for you.
Kusang's come back/
-Kusang?
-The porter who went with my husband and the others.
- I saw him in the courtyard.
- You're mistaken.
-No, but I am not mistaken.
I saw him, I tell you, in the courtyard.
-It was not Kusang.
-But I swear I saw...
-You are concerned for your husband.
-He's in danger, I'm sure of it.
-Danger?
Yes. They are in danger.
Danger?
All of them?
From their own actions?
-I don't understand you, but you've got to help me do something. Warn them, bring them back.
- I can do anything.
- Why?
-It is not possible to bend the destiny of men
The fate of your husband will be governed by his own nature.
Mr. Fox, you will conduct this lady back to her living quarters.
-I'm so sorry about this, sir. Come on.
- Get me away.
-You're gonna be Kay, now.
- Get me away.
- Of course yes.
-Do they not even realize the hopelessness they're in?
We've got to find him, Foxy.
There's no way of telling where they are by now.
-With three or four native guides we have some chance.
- Native guys?
- I'll talk to the porters down there.
-You'll never persuade them to go, not into those high valleys.
I think I can.
But suppose that the llama forbids them to?
-Listen Foxy, they're waiting for money, aren't they?
Well, I can give it to them.
-For heaven's sake,
Helen, you're not going to give them all that.
I'll give them all I've got, Foxy.
-Alright, but let me handle it.
We don't want to overdo it.
There's one of them now.
Where are the others?
Where are the others?
Well, call them for me. Call them.
-Alright. Alright. Now
 I want all four. All four.
Alright, now, wait, wait, wait.
-Hey, Doc.
- Hawk, the Harold angels.
- What's the matter now?
- Doc! Come down here!
-I'll come when I can!
They're noisy.
We'll transverting to the cave.
It will give us protection against heavy snows.
-Don't tell me Friend is delaying here for my sake.
Oh, no. No he's not.
He says ??? ....
In a couple days this
 all should be usable.
-Thanks to you.
Tell me, what does it look like?
-The dead one?
-Uh-huh.
Well, you'll see. There's a lot of nothing but guesses.
It''s massive and its height is about ten foot five inches.
Weight 650 pounds, age is difficult to assess.
-No, that's not what I mean.
Didn't you see what it looked like?
-The face?
-Yes, but there's nothing apelike about it,
There's nothing human, either, but I thought it had...
-Go on, go on.
-Sadness and there's probably only a surface resemblance of wisdom.
-Rollason, we need you down here.
- How does it feel?
- Better.
-But try to ease the boot on slowly.
And I'll take these packs and
 come back down for you.
-Hold it there a bit. Alright?
Doc, come around this side.
- Gee, Ed, pull.
- Ok.
Let's see if we can get a little more inside.
Let's see if we can pull more ...???
-Well, I'll get you down there now.
McNee.
McNee!
McNee!
-He's gone.
-Gone?
-Yes, without this and without ???
-Up there, look.
-McNee!
McNee!
McNee!
McNee!
McNee!
-Watch out!
He must have hit the rock, it would have been instantaneous.
-They killed him.
It was the sound of that howling.
He couldn't stand it. It drove him mad.
-He failed because his foot was useless.
-They killed him!
Ed.
Ed, you alright?
What happened?
I just got to it. The gunmen...I just got to them.
What happened?
-They came at me! Two of them!
You just don't know what it's like.
In the light...
- They, they...
- Here, take it, Rick.
- But how did it happen?
- Take it easy, Ed.
Go on.
- I... I just came of the cave and the two came running towards me.
The size of them!
They were incredibly fast!
-I got my gun!
-I know!
You blasted off enough to start an avalanche, but you missed them.
Yes, it was like this, the sun was in my eyes and I couldn't get organized.
-Tom, they're after me.
They know it was me who did that.
Now get out there... -They're after all of us! They just killed McNee.
-Why say that? It was an accident.
-It's me next. They know it was me.
Oh, don't worry. I've had this before.
Me and a grizzly once, we ran a war for the whole winter.
I can handle it!
-But we want to act, that's what we're gonna do! Right now!
Hey, Tom, let's get some action! why do we just sit around?
We know they are up there.
Why don't we go up there and find them?
-Look, kid, I've got an idea.
You've had a lot of tough assignments.
Can you handle one more?
-That's what I want, yeah, action!
-Can you rig that steel net up on the roof of that cave?
Yeah, I guess some
sort of little trap or anything if I go in there?
-Yeah, I can do that.
What about to bring him in the trap?
Who does that?
-I get it.
I do.
I'm in the back there
I think as bait, right?
- Right.
- You're a catcher, Tom.
-Oh, sure I'll do it, I told you that's what I wanted.
Let's get to work while you still got me in mind.
-Yeah, well, let's get it cleared.
Give me a spade.
-Ah, here's one. Why do you want a spade for?
-Oh, yeah, Jock.
-Foxy.
Foxy. Foxy, a food container.
They've been here. We must go on.
-We damn hope not.
We're gonna camp here.
Listen, if they realize where we go, they will all desert. And this time, you'll never get them back.
-Tom, it's all fixed.
Come and look.
- Alright.
-Well, there she is.
One pull on this and the whole thing comes down.
-I'm sure it will work.
-Ah, test it and try!
Nice work, eh, Doc?
You know what I feel?  I don't like the idea of you parting least of all.
-If you want advice...
-Listen Doc, he doesn't need your advice.
He can pull up any time he wants to.
- -Who wants to pull out?
-It's your business of course. but the risk cannot be calculated.
-When that thing falls anything underneath it will be fully occupied.
That's Tungsten-steel with a break and strain of 20,000 pounds.
The more it struggles, the more
 the whole thing tightens on it.
An addition to which... here you are, Ed, clean and loaded.
-Thanks, Tom.
Just in case I should need it.
- Just in case.
- Ah, you can trust me.
-I am trusting you with this unique specimen when it shows up.
It began to snow out there again.
Listen, Ed...we... we'll keep you covered from the tent and check every half hour, but oh, if anything happens, you signal.
- You bet I'll signal.
 - Alright.
-This is complete madness, Friend, and you know it.
-Relax, will you? He knows how to hold his fire.
This blizzard...
- You can see the cave?
- Yeah, so far.
-You better call it off.
-Call it off?
This snow may be just the thing they're waiting for.
-That man is depending on it.
-If he gets in trouble, I'm gonna help him.
Don't worry.
Friend, why not settle for the one we've got?
-I've said no.
-You've cracked the mystery. You've proved this creature exists. Settle for that.
- Take back a dead one?
-If we can.
H-ave them pick it, write out running reports, take a skeleton and call him something Rollason?
-I'm not looking for credit.
-No, not gonna be like that. He's mine.
-Like the famous wolf children?
-Just the opposite, this is not fake,
That's why I’m not gonna give up.
-I'm gonna prove to them
 I can bring the real thing.
-You can't drag this down to a personal level. It's far too important.
-Not to me.
-Listen, it's a long land creature.
It's strong, intelligent.
And they have powers we haven't even developed.
It might have been headed to
 the earth. Something they keep hidden.
And hinted is the last of a species, hiding away where nothing else will live.
Waiting in misery and despair for final extinction.
In addition there is also a moral issue....
-Look, if they drop the
H-bomb, your... your descendents, too might end up in the ice.
-Did you see anything?
-Well... I thought...
No.
No. Let's ...let's have a cigarette.
-Tom!
-It's okay, we're turned.
Stop.
-I can't see a thing.
Rollason, let's keep together.
 Come on!
-There it is!
Ripped to pieces!
Ed!
Ed!
- He's dead.
- Dead?
Well, but...
-How did they kill him?
-I can't find any mark.
It looks like a heart attack.
- His face...
- I think he died from shock.
He didn't use the gun! Why?
-There.
- Just a minute.
-the magazine's empty.
It's strange.
Each shell has been fired in it but it didn't go off.
They didn't go off, Friend.
You loaded shotgun.
What with? Fake ammunition?
-I didn't want another dead one.
I knew he would fire even if the net held.
He was scared.
-They did want this.
The shotgun must have frightened him off.
I think that was what
 all they wanted.
-You mean they went after Ed?
-No.
- But they killed him?
- No, they didn't, Friend.
-You did.
-Think that will stop them?
-It will give us a fighting chance if they decide to attack.
- If they do.
- So you think they won't, eh?
Let me tell you something.
We're not gonna take any chances of losing that one.
Plus, We do like you said, Doc.
Be satisfied with the one we've got.
-I think this is a little late.
It's cold in here.
- Want a drink, Doc?
- No, no thanks.
-Yeah we go to keep alert, keep our circulation up, be ready for them.
We had to hit the first time.
There may not be a second chance.
-What's on your mind?
-I wonder if they'll try.
-Try?
-They know you've got a gun and what it can do.
-They knew Ed had a gun and it didn't stop them.
-Bet they knew what you knew about Shelley's gun.
-You mean they get...thought transfers?
Oh, don't give me that.
Let's get something,
Doc. These are animals.
Dangerous killers. And that's all they are.
-McNee died from an accident.
-Shelley died of his own fear.
-There is much out there that's dangerous.
So much as Moxy and us.
-What are you doing there?
I'm wondering... wondering how old that face is.
It's seen a long life longer than ours, I should say.
A hundred years, perhaps more.
This isn't a face of a savage thing...that
-It's gentleness.
-Gentleness?
-Suppose they are not just a pitiable remnant waiting to die out.
They're waiting yes... waiting for us to...
-For mankind to die out?
-There's something the Llama said, about taking thought of man's successors.
I didn't understand then, but suppose we are the savages?
-We're what? Are you out of your mind, Doc?
-Perhaps then we'd be in the Dark Ages. protected ourselves too long.
Perhaps we are not  Homo
 Sapiens, the thinking men,
But has our thinking brought us to.
But Homo Westerns
They're the destroyers.
When the world knows about these creatures, they're destroyed, too.
And because we are men, we can only be here to destroy them.
They must be aware of that.
- I mean, we're the enemies?
If they can deal with us, your secret's kept.
- It's our only chance of survival.
- Up here on the ice?
Survival for what? - It's enough until their half of the time comes.
- Doc, you better have a drink.
- We could have something to eat.
-That's a good idea, then
 we'll turns on watch.
Throw me some in those
 self heating cans will you?
It's like living inside of an iceberg here.
-Soup coming up.
And now short weather forecasts in English
for our Himalayan climbing party.
First the Tom-Friend expedition in the western Himalayas.
You are warned to return to base immediately.
Abandoning all gear.
I repeat. Abandon all gear and return.
- Friend.
- Yeah?
- Where's the radio?
- Over there. It's all smashed up.
-Smashed?
- If you were thinking of trying to fix it, you can forget it.
It's broken.
-Didn't you hear?
-Hear what?
I told you that thing is wrecked.
- Friend, we must get out of here.
- What's the matter with you?
We're gonna get out of here when it's daylight and not before.
What is the matter with
 you? Are you cracking up?
-Yeah, maybe that's it.
A touch of altitude sickness.
-Yeah, well, go get some oxygen, right over there.
Alright, just turn the tap,
 it's all ready for use.
- I'll use it.
Don't want you going sick on me.
Won't be easy managing
 that sledge tomorrow.
All that new snow will bound
 to make it unstable.
Feeling better?
-Yeah.
- Is that better?
- Yes.
It's gonna be tough going we'll just have to get out of the middle of this glacier and just keep going.
That's all, keep going.
-Help!
Help me!
-Ed...
-Tom...help me!
Tom, help me!
-What's the matter with you?
Didn't you hear that?
-What...can you hear?
-Tom, help!
-It's Ed. I can hear  him yelling out there. They got him.
- Stay here, wait!
- Ed, I can hear you! I'm going!
-Don't you understand? that it isn't
Shelley, it isn't anybody.
- But I can hear his voice.
- It's in your own mind!
It's just happened to me too.
- I've got to save him!
- Listen, Shelley's dead!
- No, no, that's a mistake!
- You need to stop. Can't you understand?
Ed, I'm coming!
Friend!
-Tom, help me!
-Ed!
Ed.
I don't understand, Ed!
Ed, where are you?
Ed!
-I'm here!
I came to help you and
 this time I mean it!
-Friend!
Don't use the gun!
The snow!
The snow!
Help, Tom, help!
Help! Help me!
Ed, I can't see you!
-Stop firing!
Come  back!
Where are you, Ed?
Where are you?
Where are you, Ed?
Friend!
Come back! It's an avalanche!
Get under cover, quick!
Friend!
Friend!
Friend!
Friend!
Friend!
Friend.
-Helen!
Helen! Helen!
Helen!
Here, wake up! Grab one of these.
Follow me. Come on!
-John!
John!
-Helen!
-I found him!
I found him!
- I'm sorry, this has
 been for you a severe trial.
All your companions dead and all these accidents.
And  through all this sufferings,
You did not find what you went out to seek?
- I'm afraid I was wrong.
- Wrong?
What I was looking for does not exist.
-You are certain of that?
-Yes.
There is no
Yeti.

We've gotta figure out where that power fade comes from.
Okay, I'll see you later.
Bye.
You ever think of trying sleep instead of benzedrine?
You know, you might like it.
Brother, I've had some tough nuts to crack in my time.
Thanks.
But nothing like this.
And to top it off, this guy has to go and get himself killed right outside.
- If he was killed.
- What do you mean?
Well, he could have died from natural causes, you know.
Oh. That's a switch coming from a base security man.
You fellows are usually suspicious of everything.
Here's the sentry's reports, and, uh, this just came in from the FBI.
- That's what they have on the dead man Griselle.
- Oh, yeah?
"Jacques Griselle, 35.
French Canadian.
"Graduated Toronto University.
Specialized in scientific farming.
"Good war record.
Born in Toronto.
"Went north for farming after the war.
Has sister Barbara, age 24, living on the farm with him."
Well, both the Griselles got a clean slate. There's nothing suspicious.
Yeah? What was Griselle doing in the woods at 3:00 in the morning?
- Farming?
- Cigarette?
No, thanks.
What are you gonna do now? Get yourself all involved in this business?
Let the local authorities figure it out, Jeff.
The colonel doesn't think it's that easy, and neither do I.
Besides, who can forget the look on that dead man's face?
There's probably some simple explanation.
Hmm. I don't know.
Maybe Doc Warren has the answer.
He should be finished with the autopsy by now. Let's go on over.
Okay.
- Morning, Doc.
- Morning, Jeff, Hal.
- Hi, Doc.
- I've just been trying to get you.
- Well, what's the story?
- Sit down.
- I wasn't able to perform your autopsy.
- Why not?
Because the mayor of Winthrop and a local doctor named Bradley, who's the coroner too, came up and claimed the body this morning.
- Why didn't you call me?
- The mayor had already talked to the colonel.
- Oh, that's ridiculous.
- They've got the body, so it's finished.
Finished?
I wouldn't bet on it.
They'll probably blame the death on our atomic reactors.
Mmm, it's this fear of radioactive fallout.
We're not exploding atom bombs.
We're just using atomic power for our radar experiments.
Go out and tell him that.
You know, we're 1,000 miles from the nearest decent-sized city.
What a bunch of backward people.
They've blamed us for too little rain, too much rain, the blight, the beetle, even Mrs. O'Leary's ailing cow.
We have to have an autopsy, so we can prove the death wasn't caused by radiation.
Well, the coroner said it was heart failure. That oughta do it.
He's one of them.
- Well, you can't figure their minds, though.
Excuse me, sir.
Colonel Butler phoned... to ask the major to report to his office right away.
All right, Mr. Mayor, if that's the way it is, no sense in asking you again, is there?
No, sir. There'll be no autopsy.
Come in.
Ah, Major Cummings.
- You sent for me, sir?
- Yes, Major.
I'd like to introduce
Miss Barbara Griselle and Mayor Hawkins.
- Major Cummings.
- How do you do?
- Major.
- If you don't mind,
I've made up my mind.
Just this one point.
You know that our governments,
Canada and the U.S.A., have set up this base as a joint protection for our people.
We know that, and we've told you that we feel that the refusal of an autopsy...
Sorry, Miss Griselle... Refusing to do it won't disrupt the effort.
Miss Griselle, Mayor Hawkins,
I'm no parley diplomat,
I'm an army man.
I'm straightforward, maybe even blunt.
But I'm afraid I must use stronger methods of persuasion.
Do you recognize this,
Miss Griselle?
It's your brother's notebook.
He's made some very interesting notations.
Major, take a look at this page here.
What's it look like to you?
It's a timetable schedule.
Do you note the times indicated in each line?
- What is it?
- Why, the schedule of our takeoffs and landings.
That's enough to give me what I want, Miss Griselle.
- May I have a look at that notebook?
- Give it to her, Major.
Thank you.
This schedule is a list of your takeoff and landings.
Our herds milk at four-nothing cream content, and my brother felt it was due to the jets flying overhead.
That's why he was gathering this information.
If you notice in the following pages, here's what it says:
"Helen: Less nervous today, quality low.
"Diane: Apathetic, quality poor.
Mabel: Very pert, general improvement. "
And so on with the other members of the herd.
This was a daily reaction of each cow.
Perhaps the colonel can tell us what he thought the items referred to.
I guess that's all we have to discuss.
Thank you for coming.
The colonel's a nice guy really, but he does have his problems.
- You don't have to apologize for him.
- Well, I'm not.
It's just that he has a job to do, a difficult one under the circumstances.
Please, I'd rather not discuss it.
Okay. I was only trying to...
- Trying to what?
- Oh, I don't know.
I guess I was looking for a way to say
I understand what you've been through.
- Do you?
- What the heck? We're all human here.
We're not monsters from outer space.
- Well, thanks.
- What for?
Oh, for the lift and the words of comfort.
I wish I could do more.
I have no hard feelings, if that's what you're thinking.
Well, I was, but not anymore.
So long.
Control ready, sir.
Green Dog, Green Dog, this is Pyramid.
Are you ready for Test Baker? Over.
This is Green Dog. This is Green Dog.
We are circling quite easily at 40,000 feet.
Standing by for Test Baker.
Over.
Okay, Green Dog, commence Test Baker.
Commence Test Baker.
Over.
Try starting out on the 500 mile range.
Set for the 500 mile range,
Sergeant.
Master scope set at 500 mile range.
Generators set.
Position six Charlie.
Start scanning, normal speed.
Scanning, normal speed.
Increase scanning speed 20 rpm's.
Scanning now, 20 rpm's.
Increase range to 1,000 miles.
Range increased to 1,000 miles, sir.
Steady on your sensitive control, number three.
Right, sir.
Increase range to 1,500 miles.
Range increasing to 1,500 miles, sir.
- Hold it steady now, Sergeant.
- Right, sir.
Okay, Sergeant, increase to 2,000 miles.
Increasing range to 2,000 miles, sir.
Range increased to 2,000.
Look, sir. Siberia.
Increase range to 2,500 miles.
Range increased to 2,500, sir.
If we can keep this equipment working right, we can watch those Russians 24 hours a day right in their own backyard.
We can spot any plane, any missile, anything that's airborne.
Image is fading, sir.
There it goes again.
Same trouble.
Green Dog, Green God, this is Pyramid.
Check your equipment.
Our image is fading. Over.
This is Green Dog.
This is Green Dog.
Our equipment is working okay. Over.
The signal's going out okay from here, sir. There's no drop in power.
- There must be some interference.
There's no other answer.
- Try increasing the power.
We're pushing the atomic plant as much as we can now.
We've got to lick this power fade.
Tell them to pour it on.
Peterson.
Pete, this is Cummings,
Master Control.
We want you to give us everything you've got.
But Jeff, we've already exceeded the designed limits.
Every time you take a test you ask for more power.
If I take any more rods out, the reactor's liable to go out of control.
Well, take some more out.
We'll have to risk it.
- We've got to have more power.
- Okay, it's your funeral.
Mine too, probably.
- Yes, sir?
- Remove ten more rods from reactor number three.
- That's crazy, sir.
- Yeah, I know, but it's an order.
Power's been boosted, sir, but still can't increase image further.
It doesn't matter how much we boost the transmitter power if it doesn't reach the plane.
You know, it's almost as if the power were being drained off.
Well, we'll just have to keep working on it.
And in the meantime, what new excuse do I give the Pentagon?
This is Green Dog.
This is Green Dog.
Standing by for instructions. Over.
Okay, Green Dog.
Okay, Green Dog.
Test Baker is completed.
Return to base.
Repeat, Test Baker is completed.
Return to base. Over.
- Roger and out.
- Okay, Sergeant, let's close shop.
Jacques Griselle's sum of good overshadows the other.
What has he marked up in the ledger for good... as against the ledger for bad?
He was a good and generous man...
And now we consecrate the worldly remains of our beloved Jacques...
to the good earth from whence he sprang.
- Closer and closer.
- Thank goodness the cows are getting used to them.
Aye.
Are we eating soon?
It'll be ready in a minute.
I just want to feed the chickens first.
Amelia! Amelia!
Amelia! Amelia!
What is it?
What is it?
What happened?
Amelia!
- Can I see you home, Barbara?
- No, thank you, Mayor.
I think I better go back with Professor
Walgate, keep my mind occupied.
Are you sure you want to?
My work can wait, you know.
Say, Mayor!
Ben Adams and his wife are dead, same as young Griselle.
- Where?
- Up at their farm.
At the edge of the air base.
But Mayor Hawkins, you're taking a great deal for granted.
There is absolutely no evidence... pointing to radioactive fallout... or radioactive contamination of any kind.
Yes, we'll do everything we can,
I assure you.
Yes. Yes. Good-bye.
In addition to our headaches with the Pentagon, we're now being accused of killing off the people in this town.
Perhaps they'd cooperate, sir, if we could explain more about our antimissile program.
- Not the secrets...
- You know that's impossible, Jeff.
Come in.
It'll be rough if the town turns against us.
Sir, we began a complete investigation of the Adams farm, but the local constable, a man named Gibbons, told us to get off the place.
Said it came under his jurisdiction, and we had no business being there.
What kind of cooperation do you call that?
They're nervous, upset. We've got to find out how those people died.
Suppose you get all of the Adams' relatives.
See if you can persuade them to let us do an autopsy.
- Yes, sir, I'll try.
- Reassure them. Promise them anything.
But get hold of those bodies.
I made a complete autopsy on both cases.
I called Dr. Bradley in to check my findings, and our opinions concur.
It's fantastic.
On examination of the skull of Mr. Adams,
I noticed two small holes on the base of the occipital region here.
They penetrated to the medulla oblongata, where the spinal cord meets the brain.
I opened the skull to investigate and found this.
The brain, it's gone!
Yes, sucked out like an egg through those two holes.
That's not all.
The entire spinal cord is missing.
But it... it's incredible.
It's as if some mental vampire were at work.
Where has the brain and spinal cord gone?
I'm a doctor, Colonel, not a detective.
There's nothing like this in the books.
Major Cummings had the best explanation so far... mental vampire.
That's rubbish!
Possibly some animal...
Colonel, Colonel, I've lived in these backwoods all my life, and I can assure you there's no animal in these parts that could do that.
Maybe that guy Gibbons was right about the supernatural.
Well, whatever the explanation, we'll find it.
We must find it.
In the meantime, Doctor,
I trust I can rely on your discretion.
Not to tell the mayor or the townspeople?
Of course. I've got an overworked practice as it is, Colonel.
Thank you.
Dr. Warren, I want you to get on the phone.
Consult the top medical specialists, wherever they are.
- Yes, sir.
- Captain, contact the best authorities.
Tell them what the problem is.
Find out what they have to say.
Jeff, the townsfolk know you.
Talk to them.
Check on anything that seems to be extraordinary, no matter what it is.
Hello?
Anybody home?
Uh, Miss Griselle?
Oh, Miss Griselle, I, uh...
Great.
Look, um, Miss Griselle,
I'm sorry for, um, barging in like that.
But, well, I knocked and there was no answer.
The door was open, so l...
Make yourself at home, Major.
I'll be out in a minute.
Uh, thank you.
Found something interesting?
Oh, I was just glancing around...
That's all right. Prof. Walgate was preparing these for publication anyway.
- Are you collating his material?
- I do most of it.
He dictates on this.
I edit the tapes and prepare the draft manuscripts.
- That's some job.
- Mmm, but interesting.
The professor must be quite a guy... thought control, sibonetics, all that stuff.
That's only half of it.
Strange, isn't it, finding a man like that here in Winthrop?
In these uncivilized backwoods,
I think you were going to say.
Well, I'm afraid so.
The explanation is quite a simple one.
Prof. Walgate had a stroke about five years ago.
- He's retired now.
- Well, he still works.
- And at odd hours.
- Odd hours?
He thinks nothing of starting work at 11:00 at night... and working until the small hours of the morning.
The mayor mentioned that Walgate was an authority on psychic phenomena.
- Is that still a hobby if his?
- I don't know.
If it is, he'll have
Dr. Bradley after him.
Dr. Bradley said no more overwork or excitement.
- What about you?
- What do you mean?
Don't you ever get some time off?
Well, sometimes.
Hello, Howard.
Come on in.
Oh, this is Major Cummings from the base.
Yeah, I know.
We've met.
Well, I guess
I'll be running along.
You've only just been here a few minutes.
I was just passing on my way back to the base.
Quite a roundabout route.
The new airfield extension covers a lot of ground.
- Too much for Winthrop's liking.
- It must keep you busy.
Yes, yes, there's a lot to do.
- I'll bet there is.
- Come again?
You found that G.I. Killer yet?
You'd be far better off huntin' him down instead of tomcattin' around here.
I should bust you...
Cut it out, the both of you!
Come on!
Sorry. I hope
I didn't break anything.
I think you'd better leave. You've done enough damage for one morning.
- Good night, sir.
- Oh, good night, Sergeant.
When you tell me you haven't known me long enough...
Oh. Yeah, okay.
Okay, I'll see ya later.
How do you like that? She says we haven't been properly introduced.
And she's a nurse.
I hope you made out better with the museums and stuff.
- They all think I'm crazy.
How'd you make out?
- We've got work to do.
Uh-uh. You're the guy who works after 5:00, not me.
This is serious. I want you to get me all the information you can on Prof. Walgate.
Everything he's ever written... books, articles, everything.
Don't worry. I'll have this guy in check by tomorrow night.
So long, Mayor.
All right, fellas, all right.
Let's stop this nonsense.
No fancy atomic radiation caused these deaths.
What about the mayor?
What killed him?
Who are you trying to fool?
It's the atomic fallout.
Hold it, fellas! Hold it!
Someone murdered the mayor.
The same maniac that killed Jacques
Griselle, Ben Adams and his wife.
- Where is he?
- If you'll shut up, I'll tell you.
Quiet there. Let him talk.
Now, the fellow we're after is out there in the woods.
Probably some mad G.I.
That's gone wild.
He can't move far if we move fast.
- Let's stop jabbering and get after him!
- Let's get him!
All right, now. Let's go!
Right, fellas.
Let's find this guy.
- Keep a sharp lookout, okay?
- Yeah, Gibbons.
Okay, let's go.
Excuse me, sir.
This just came in from the FBI.
Hmm. "Walgate. Brilliant scientist.
Recluse. Considered highly eccentric."
That old guy Walgate sounds like a cross between Einstein and Robinson Crusoe.
It gets more interesting all the time.
Okay, Sergeant,
I'm going out for a while.
Well, hello.
Nice to see you again.
I'm very busy.
Well, I'd like to see the professor.
Oh. Yes, of course.
Thank you.
Come in.
Prof. Walgate, Major Cummings from the air base to see you.
- Sorry to barge in like this, Professor.
- Not at all.
These days I welcome any excuse to stop work.
Isn't that so, Barbara?
Please take a chair, Major.
Thank you.
I came to see you about this business with the mayor.
Oh, terrible tragedy.
Really terrible.
- I need your help.
- Anything you say. Just name it.
This is the fourth death in the space of a few days.
Not only are they terrible tragedies, but they're turning the townsfolk against us.
It's just ignorance, my dear fellow.
These people are simple, one might say.
Narrow in their outlook.
Of course, the very secrecy of your activities doesn't help.
This development of radar boosted by atomic power.
What gave you that idea, sir?
There was a piece in the Patents Journal about your work on reactors.
It wasn't a year ago I read somewhere about the new radar patents.
Wasn't this territory's idea for that kind of work.
I put two and two together.
- And made five?
- Shall we say four and a half?
But you don't have to worry, Major.
What I surmise I keep to myself.
- Well, I hope so, sir.
- Let me offer you a drink. Whiskey?
Uh, yes, please.
Straight.
- Barbara?
- Uh, no, thank you, Professor.
I'll have the last chapter finished tomorrow.
That's fine.
That's real progress.
I've already begun on volume two.
My mind is really buzzing with these strange words.
Just a few elementary ideas on the subject, Major.
Not so advanced as present-day developments.
I'll transcribe these while you talk. Excuse me.
That business with her brother...
She was devoted to him.
Yes, it was a tough break.
I don't want to seem morbid, but did you see his face after he died?
- Yes.
- What was it like?
I have a reason for asking.
Well, it was an expression of complete horror.
Fright.
Almost insane, I guess.
- What is it? What gives?
- Did you get him?
- Okay, fellas, okay.
- Was it him?
No, just a false alarm.
That's all.
As you said yourself, sir, the people here are simple and superstitious.
- Maybe they're not so wrong after all.
- What do you mean?
Mmm, about the supernatural.
Something unreal, something never seen by anyone before.
I can't accept that.
I've always disproved such theories.
- What is it, then?
- Nothing supernatural, I'm sure.
I can't believe that.
I'm a scientist.
You've made a study of psychic phenomena, haven't you?
It can't be that!
It can't be!
Professor, you know what Dr. Bradley said.
Was it absolutely necessary to upset the professor?
It's nothing, nothing, Barbara.
The major and I were just having a quiet talk. I got dizzy.
Well, your quiet little talk is over, Major.
First Howard Gibbons, now the professor.
Do you have to go around making trouble?
- You really believe that, don't you?
- I can believe my eyes.
I'm sorry, Professor.
I didn't mean to disturb you.
No, not at all.
Forgive me if I don't rise.
Yes, certainly. Excuse me.
It's me! It's Frank!
Have you finished searching the quarry yet?
Yeah, and the men are tired.
They want to go home.
But they can't quit now!
We've almost reached the air base.
Well, you better tell 'em.
They won't listen to me.
Okay, fellas, you spread out again.
We'll join up at the Adams' fence.
- Say, you hear something?
- Yeah. Funny sound.
You take that path, and I'll take this one.
- If you see anything, shout.
- You said not to let each other out of sight.
These parts run almost parallel to each other. We'll meet up a ways.
The dawn's beginnin' Let's wait a little. We'll see better then.
Oh, we're close to it.
Now come on, boy.
Go on, fella.
You take that way.
Gibbons! Gibbons!
Where are you?
Gibbons!
Where the heck are you?
Gibbons!
Gibbons! Gibbons!
Where are you?
Gibbons! Gibbons!
Gibbons!
I think you should go home,
Mrs. Gibbons.
No. I'm all right, Doctor.
I'll wait here for my boy.
Don't worry.
We'll find him.
Oh, where is Howard?
Where is he?
- We've searched everywhere.
- He just disappeared.
Oh, I don't believe it.
He must be there.
- I'm gonna look for him myself.
- You can't go in the woods alone.
Oh, but I've got to find him.
I've got to find my boy!
You'd better see that she gets home.
Get your wife to look after her.
- Have you searched the woods thoroughly?
- We kept calling for him.
If Gibbons is out there and alive, he would've heard us.
No point in searching any more.
I reckon we ought to call a council meeting... and decide what we're going to do.
- What about it, Bradley?
- Well, let's get Melville.
He's the deputy mayor.
I suppose it's up to him.
I think that's a good idea.
Good evening.
Everyone quiet, please.
You all know why we're here.
We've had four deaths, and now our constable has disappeared.
The cause of these deaths is still unknown.
Everybody seems to have their own ideas, and they all seem connected with the new air base.
- Now you're talkin'
- For this reason,
I've asked Major Cummings to this meeting.
He's going to help us in any way he possibly can.
That goes for his commanding officer, who is very concerned about what's happened.
Cut out the soft soap, Melville.
Let's get down to brass tacks.
All I know is, before this air base came here, we were doing fine.
Now you and these Air Force fellows tell us that it's not radiation at all.
Well, maybe you're right at that.
I don't know.
But forgetting about the deaths, how do you explain the change in quality of the cows' milk, even the quantity?
Let the major tell me about that.
Go ahead, Major.
No one can make anyone believe something if they don't want to believe it.
But it has been proven that there has been no radiation affecting anyone in Winthrop.
- Hmm.
- Not even the cows.
As for the milk... I don't know enough about farming, but I would assume...
Griselle did.
He knew his business.
So do I. It was the noise of the jets that did it.
It frightened the herd.
But I can tell you that the herd is normal again.
They've got used to it.
Thank you.
As for the deaths, gentlemen, we are equally at a loss to give an answer.
Now, there's been some talk of a mad G.I. On the prowl.
This, I can assure you, is not true.
We've checked and rechecked our personnel.
We know how you feel, but we're trying to protect our countries from a guided missile attack.
If you'd only help us instead of fighting us.
Ah, it's all a waste of time.
Let's get rid of the base.
We had no trouble before they came here.
I think that's rather extreme...
Gibbons!
It was terrible, Jeff.
What could have happened to him?
I don't know.
- Would you like a drink?
- No. No, thanks.
Barbara, I think Prof. Walgate is involved in these deaths.
- I don't understand.
- Neither do I. Maybe it's just a hunch.
But his background, his training...
- Oh, Jeff!
- Look, Barbara, I checked on Walgate.
This research of his...
Somehow I think it ties in with what's happened in Winthrop.
- Oh, that's crazy.
- Is it?
- Mind if I borrow this?
- Where are you going?
I'd like to take a look at your cemetery.
Hey! Hey!
Anybody out there?
I'm locked in here!
Hey!
Hey!
- Any word yet from Major Cummings?
- Not a thing yet, sir.
- Well, keep trying.
- Hello?
Hello, Miss Griselle.
This is Captain Chester.
I've been trying to locate Major Cummings.
- He left here about 7:30.
- Well, did he say where he was going?
Yes. He borrowed a flashlight and said something about going to the cemetery.
Look, I don't like the sound of all this.
You wait there.
I'll be over right away.
Are you sure this is the place?
Oh, this is the place all right.
Hey, listen.
- Huh?
- Listen.
I don't hear anything.
Wait a minute.
Over this way.
There's someone inside all right.
It's jammed.
Here, hold this.
- Oh, hurry! Come on!
- Hold the flashlight closer.
There, it's coming.
Here he is!
Jeff! Jeff!
There's no air in here.
Keep the door open.
- He'll be all right.
- Jeff, it's me... Barbara.
- Are you all right?
- Barbara.
Yeah, you're not dreaming, buddy, it's Barbara.
- I was locked in, no air.
- Take it easy now.
Come on, we'll get you back to the base.
- I gotta see Walgate.
- You're in no shape to see anybody.
I've got to see Walgate.
Come in.
Good evening.
Major Cummings.
Oh, Barbara...
It's very late.
I hope you don't mind, sir.
Oh, on the contrary,
I'm glad to see you. Sit down.
We missed you at the town council meeting.
I saw Gibbons afterwards.
His mind was gone completely mad.
- It was dreadful.
- I was hoping maybe you could help us.
- Me? How can I help you?
- You're an atomic expert.
- Who told you that?
- Our files in Washington.
- Have you been checking on me?
- Yes.
- Oh.
- Here, would you care for a cigarette, Professor?
No, thanks.
I'm attached to my pipe.
Uh, Professor,
I read one of your books... on the materialization of thought.
You denied that it was possible, but the thought was intriguing.
Yes, if it could be done, why, man could create power by thought.
He could will a door to open.
He could perform useful work without moving from this chair.
- Practically anything.
- I said it was impossible, didn't I?
Is it? Perhaps with atomic power it could be done.
Oh, please. I'm tired and sick.
Stop badgering me.
I will if you'll answer me a few questions.
- Jeff!
- I'm sorry, but I've got to go on.
What were you doing in the cemetery tonight?
Were you, uh, looking for this?
I didn't mean to shut you in, close the door on you.
I was frightened when I heard you.
I only wanted time to get away.
I only realized later that you might be shut, trapped.
- I called Barbara, but...
- If she hadn't rescued me,
I wouldn't be alive.
- Jeff!
- What were you doing there, Professor?
I had to examine the mayor's body.
I had to find out the truth.
What was that?
Professor, what's the matter?
- Here, sit back.
- Professor, can you hear me?
It's a terrible story.
Shut down your atomic plant, Major.
Call Dr. Bradley right away.
I'm going back to the base.
Jeff... be careful.
I'm afraid.
I'll be back right away.
I'd like to try that again when I have more time.
But the thing's fantastic.
You can't shut down a whole atomic power plant on such a wild theory.
We can't deny the facts, sir.
Griselle, the Adams couple, the mayor.
They all died a few minutes after the peak of our radar tests, right after our atomic plant was operating under full power.
But it'll take months to get the plant operating again.
That's better than risking any more lives or madmen like Gibbons.
Okay, let's put it on ice.
How soon will you be ready, Pete?
We'll shut her down in five minutes.
- The rods are all smashed!
- What happened?
- I don't know.
- We'll never be able to shut her down now.
- What about spares?
- We have no extras of anything.
There must be some way of controlling the reaction.
Without the rods, we don't stand a chance.
The nearest supply would be at the Hanford Works on the Columbia River.
- How soon can we get a shipment flown in?
- Four to six hours.
Get me the Hanford Works on the Columbia River right away.
Well, Doc, how is he?
Oh, there's no question.
It's another attack, a little more serious than the last.
- He'll be all right?
- Oh, sure, sure, sure.
See he gets plenty of rest.
Call me if there's any change.
For goodness sake, get somebody out here to stay with you.
Jeff... Major Cummings said he'll be back soon.
Jeff? Major Cummings?
Mm-hmm.
Obviously, those rods were destroyed.
How and for what reason we don't know.
But we do know that we're in trouble up here.
Serious trouble.
Hello. Yes, put her through.
It's for you, Jeff.
Barbara Griselle.
Thank you.
Hello, Barbara.
Okay, good.
We'll be right over.
Right. Bye.
Walgate's regained consciousness.
I think we better get over there.
- Right.
- Al, we better get some sidearms.
Kasper, get hold of Dr. Bradley and Melville right away.
Have them meet us at Walgate's house.
I should feel better after I've told you everything.
Maybe you can help me to clear up this ghastly business.
But no matter what you do to me, remember those horrible deaths were beyond my control.
Go on, Professor.
For many years now,
I have been working on a theory of thought materialization.
The entire apparatus to give it the required boost... is in my laboratory.
Laboratory?
I didn't know you had one.
There are many things you didn't know, my child.
If you had, you'd never have come here again.
You can see it later.
I knew I could never succeed on the principles of telepathy.
I needed to stimulate my brain... to the extent that I could detach thought from my conscious... to give it a separate entity of its own.
I concentrated on the simplest experiment:
To turn the page of a book.
I designed an instrument to create...
a sudden and powerful electrical boost...
to help me free my thought.
But each application of the electric charge...
created a shock almost equal to electrocution.
It made me ill.
Dr. Bradley diagnosed exhaustion.
He thought my illness was caused by overwork...
in getting my papers ready for publication.
He introduced me to Barbara Griselle.
With Barbara as my secretary,
I was able to satisfy my publisher...
and continue my experiments to materialize thought.
For a long time, I persisted in this one experiment...
without success... until one night.
The lightning, in striking the house, gave my instruments a sudden violent charge of power.
And my thought was free, free to turn the page of a book.
I altered the design of my equipment...
to generate these violent power boosts.
But it was very dangerous,
and I could only undergo each experiment...
after a long period of rest.
Whenever I felt well enough to absorb the shock,
I found no difficulty in moving small objects.
Eventually, I developed a certain tolerance...
to the high voltages I used.
But what I really needed for regular experiments...
was a new form of power, something that was smoother,
something that would flow through my brain without causing collapse.
The new atomic plant at the air base provided me with this power.
I devised additional apparatus that enabled me...
to divert a portion of the atomic power...
that was radiating between the ground station...
and the radar aircraft circling 40,000 feet above.
It was power which I could control,
and I learned how to amplify my thoughts without hurting myself.
I was able to detach my thoughts...
and allow them to work on their own.
I began to devise a being...
into which the thought, once released,
could enter and preserve itself for all humanity.
I envisaged something akin to the human brain...
with life and mobility...
but without the limitations of man's body.
I concentrated my entire thought on its creation.
I succeeded!
But, like thought itself, it was invisible.
That night I entered my laboratory...
to take advantage of a radar test...
only to find the place in shambles,
my equipment wrecked beyond repair.
All of my notes about its creation...
and how I thought it could be controlled...
were destroyed.
I knew now that
I had created a fiend.
There was no other explanation.
I was helpless, but whom could I tell?
Who would believe such a fantastic story?
I could sense the presence of the fiend there in the room with me,
growing more powerful with each succeeding day.
My one desire was to destroy the thing,
but I possessed no means of projecting my thought to do so.
Then I could hear it.
Was it possible that there were more than one?
I was unable to stop them.
They were now drawing power from the atomic station.
Its intelligence had expanded.
It now knew how to escape.
And then followed these horrible deaths and Gibbons' madness.
I had to know what I had done.
I had to see one of the bodies.
I went to the mayor's tomb.
I now know that I have created a mental vampire, a fiend that needs to drain the intellect... to survive and multiply.
I'll get it.
Supposing you're right, Professor, how does it live?
How else but on the brains and nerve centers... removed from these dead people.
Then where are they, and why can't we see them? This is nonsense.
We're facing a new form of life... that nobody understands.
I believe it feeds on the radiation from your atomic plant, and that it's evil.
Professor, it's my opinion that the evil's all in your mind.
You're in need of medical assistance.
Doctor, I'm glad you're here.
This man's become a raving lunatic.
Hey, what's going on out there?
Hey, look!
Hello. Hello!
Professor, what's wrong with your telephone?
Nothing should be the matter, unless they've got enough intelligence to cut the lines.
Jeff, I want you to get over to the air base. I want emergency patrols.
He's dead.
Give me a hand with this.
Barricade those windows!
Have you got anything we can nail across that window?
There's some lumber in my laboratory.
- I've gotta get out!
- Oh, pull yourself together and help me with this!
Well, at least lock the door!
Oh, never mind!
- Hey, Captain, give me a hand.
- Yes, sir.
If we'd only see them, we'd know what to do.
- Is there any way to make them visible?
- Not that I know.
Unless it's a question of the amount of atomic radiation that's available.
Hello? Hello, Kasper?
I want to talk to the colonel.
Hello? Hello, Kasper?
Are you there? Hello, hello?
I've got to get out of here,
I tell you!
Oh, no, no.
Melville, no, no.
Get back. Get back.
Melville, Melville, get a grip on yourself.
- Get ahold of yourself.
- But l...
Why are they so quiet?
Maybe they're gonna leave us alone.
I doubt it. But they've just put out a burst of energy.
Perhaps they need to rest.
Colonel Butler, how long does it take to shut down your atomic plant?
- Why?
- If my theory is right, without the radiation of which
I was speaking, these things must die.
- Good grief!
- What is it?
What do you see?
Let me through!
Hey, Jeff, Professor, they're becoming visible!
Someone or something must have increased the power at the atomic plant.
What have I unleashed?
- It's ghastly! It's horrible!
- You can say that again.
It all ties up with what
Dr. Warren explained to us.
Look carefully.
Al, get those sidearms.
I'm sure it's the atomic plant.
So long as it goes on, they will multiply,
getting stronger and stronger.
Yeah, well, we'll see about that.
Well, anyway, they're mortal.
Hold it!
You'll hit him!
- He's dead.
- We've got to stop 'em!
There's only one way:
Shut down your atomic plant.
Unless we shut off the radiation, we'll all be destroyed.
- Heaven knows how many others.
- There's a dynamite shed between here and the plant.
If I can get through,
I can blow up the control room.
Well, if that's the way it's got to be.
- I'm afraid it is.
- Jeff!
Must it be you, Jeff?
- I know the control room layout.
- Be careful, Jeff, please.
Yeah, I will.
And be sure and lock this door.
He can't go alone. He won't last a minute amongst those fiends.
It's too late, Professor.
Somebody had to get through.
Then cover him as he leaves the house.
And shoot straight.
Don't waste the shot.
- Do you see him?
- No, not yet.
- You can't, Professor!
- It's suicide!
They're my creation.
Perhaps I can control them.
Give Jeff a chance.
Lock it after me.
- That was a brave man.
- What's gonna happen to Jeff?
Take it easy now.
I know that guy.
If anybody can get through, he can.
Oh, it's been so long since Jeff left.
Don't even think about it.
It's so quiet.
I wonder what they're up to.
We're almost out of ammunition.
Well, Captain, let's get started.
Doc, I'll send you some help as soon as I get over to the air base.
- Thanks, Colonel.
- What about Jeff?
He's been gone for hours.
Jeff! Jeff!
I thought that...
It's okay, honey.
It's all over.
Well, Major,
I'm leaving you in charge.
Report back when you have the situation well in hand.
- Good luck, Jeff.
- Thanks, boy.
Well, Doc, I hope now that we got this thing licked, you'll encourage your people to cooperate with us.
Well, I reckon we owe it to you, Major.
And it strikes me you are setting a very good example.
Now at this point you bring the music up, up... up, up, up to a crescendo.
Up.
There now. This is where i make my entrance.
Now, from here on, pianissimo, keep it under while I talk.
Softly, softly, softly. That's right.
Ladies and gentlemen, magic is the science of illusion, the art of misdirecting thought.
So if you will try and keep your thoughts on what I am doing, l'll...
There. That's fine, fine.
Sorry, sir. They're rehearsing inside.
No visitors.
But this is something special.
I have a lady friend in the show.
No smoking.
Oh, I'm sorry. I promised her
I'd be here for the opening
- miss Karen Lee?
- Miss Lee? Oh, yeah, yeah.
The little one with the legs.
Don't tell me you've never noticed them.
She's cute. Miss Lee!
Miss Lee. A gentleman to see you.
Alan. You got here after all.
You didn't think I'd miss your opening.
How's it going?
Like they always go with a new show.
Oh, I want you to meet Mr. gallico.
No, no, look, i don't want to bother him now.
Oh, it'll do him good.
Make him forget his nervousness.
You'll like him.
Gus. Be sure that entrance is kept clear for the buzz saw trick.
- Remember, it's got to be rolled on in the dark. - Mr. gallico?
I'd like you to meet lieutenant Bruce of the New York detective bureau.
- How are you? - He came all the way from New York to see our opening show.
I can see how busy you are, all this excitement.
Yes. Lt's especially exciting for me, lieutenant, since this is my first appearance on any stage.
But Mr. gallico knows more about magic than all the other magicians put together.
For years I've been inventing illusions for big-name magicians and watching them take all the bows.
Well, I finally caught the fever myself.
L'm like the playwright who wants to get in there and read his own lines.
- I guess I'm just a ham at heart.
- Who isn't?
So I put this show together, and if our luck holds out, we're headed for Broadway.
Pardon me, please.
Mr. gallico, we're ready to rehearse the buzz saw illusion.
L've sent out everybody who doesn't have a part in it.
Good. Pull that curtain down, and be sure the stage door is kept locked.
Right.
That trick is the secret of our show.
You see, lieutenant, no magician considers it a crime to steal from a competitor, so we carefully guard all our new ideas.
This buzz saw trick of mine is a prize shocker, and I'm taking no chances.
We don't even trust the police.
She doesn't mean you, lieutenant.
You don't have to go.
I think I'd better. I'll be rooting for you tonight. Good luck.
Thanks so much.
All right, now be sure that stage door is locked.
All right.
This trick can put us over on Broadway.
It all depends on how it's done.
- L've made it as foolproof as possible, but that saw is dangerous. - it can rip its way through anything short of steel.
All right, boys, take it from where we place Karen on the table.
Excuse me, Mr.-
I didn't recognize you, Mr. gallico.
Is it really that good?
Do I look like Rinaldi?
Like his twin.
I don't know. This is the first time any magician has ever attempted an impersonation of one of his rivals.
Holy smoke! That's the end of their act.
Mr. gallico, you're on.
L'm ready.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. gallico, who is a talented mimic, will now present several of his own illusions as they would be done by other famous magicians.
First, the great Rinaldi.
Ah, how cooling it is.
This is one convenience we do not have in my place.
Let us have some more, please.
He not only looks like Rinaldi, but he sounds like him.
Was I all right?
You were great. Just listen to them. They loved you.
- Did I sound like Rinaldi?
- Exactly like him.
All right, Karen, the buzz saw trick is next.
Now, remember, that trick is the high spot of our show.
- If it's a hit, we're in. If it's a flop, we're dead. Good luck. - Good luck.
Ladies and gentlemen, first, a demonstration.
I have here a common newel post, cut from a solid piece of mahogany.
Hey. Where are you going?
- L'm Ross ormond.
- Shh. There's a show going on.
L'm Ross ormond.
I want to talk to the house manager.
Well, he's out front.
They said he was back here on the stage.
This is police business.
Oh, all right. L'll see if I can find him.
Wait down there.
Wait down there.
Now, let us assume that this is a human body, and that this is a human head.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the most dangerous exhibition ever attempted, and I must ask for complete silence.
The least disturbance could cause this experiment to end in tragedy.
So now, I present for the first time on any stage,
“the lady and the buzz saw.”
- who pulled the curtain down?
- Get that curtain up again. Up.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please?
I wish to announce that owing to unforeseen circumstances, we are unable to continue with this performance.
What does he mean “unable to continue”?
Ladies and gentlemen, please.
What were you talking about out there?
How dare you pull down on me.
Ask those men.
They'll tell you.
And I'm holding you responsible for the loss on tonight's business.
L'm calling my lawyer right now.
What does he mean, “ask you”?
He means I rang down the curtain, with an injunction.
An injunction against what?
The use of the buzz saw trick.
But what right have you to...
Lieutenant, do you know anything about these things?
A little, yeah, but I'm no lawyer.
This theater is enjoined against showing your buzz saw trick.
L'm afraid they've got you.
What's it all about?
Well, if it's any of your business,
I own a company that builds illusions for magicians, and gallico is my employee.
Anything he creates becomes my property.
But I built the buzz saw trick on my own time and with my own money.
Read your contract. No matter how you built it, it still belongs to me.
Why you rotten, low-down...
No, Mr. gallico, that won't get you anywhere.
It'll get him locked up in the cityjail.
Now, listen, you.
I want this trick back in my
New York studio before noon tomorrow.
And if you know what's good for you, you'll quit playing actor and get back on your job.
Do you think
I'd work for you after this?
You'll work for me, or you won't work.
So long, gallico the great.
This is a tough contract you signed with ormond.
Is it true that he owns everything I create?
According to this, everything but the air you breathe.
Can the contract be broken?
I doubt it.
But I told him at the time that I would take care of this business as long as my show was in New York, or... or until he could replace me, and he offered no objections.
But that's his way, to say nothing and then stab you in the back.
L'm sorry. I...
I don't often forget myself like that.
I understand ormond's a big man in show business.
Yes.
I had my show all set for the 44th street theater.
They told me this morning that they'd booked another attraction.
I can thank him for that.
L'm afraid I have to go.
I thought Karen was meeting you here.
She's supposed to, but she's late.
I have an appointment at the Hudson university lab.
They're doing some pathological work for the department.
Make my excuses, will you?
Of course.
Hi, don.
Hello. You've met Mr. ormond.
- Yes.
- Lieutenant.
And I'm sure you've heard of Mr. Rinaldi, the great Rinaldi?
Master of the black arts.
Magician by royal appointment to the court of the king of Spain.
L'm sorry. That's his billing.
Next week, Jersey city.
Meet lieutenant Bruce, of the detective bureau.
A detective. Lt's a pleasure.
I trust it remains a pleasure.
L'm glad to know you,
Mr. Rinaldi.
- Excuse me. I was just leaving.
- L'll tell Karen.
Please, and tell her I'll meet her for dinner at Tony's restaurant, 6:00.
- So long.
- Thanks.
Ah. The mysterious buzz saw.
It looks very real, very dangerous.
It's no wonder you kept it a secret.
Go ahead, don.
Show him how it works.
He's a magician.
He should know how it works.
The girl's body drops through the trap.
Then, when you pretend to fix her hair, the dummy head comes up, and the real girl slips out of the machine.
Very good. But it needs a showman to present it to an audience.
It was presumptuous of you to think you could do it.
Only an amateur could be so brash.
But I'll make you famous, my pet.
In my hands you'll become a star.
Now, look, I'll send a moving Van to pick it up this afternoon and deliver it to me.
L'm bringing my show to the 44th street theater next month, and I want to start rehearsing this trick.
I'll give it top billing on all my posters.
The 44th street theater.
Of course.
Ross owns half interest in my show.
Well, I have a matinee in Jersey city.
- Good-bye, Ross.
- Good-bye.
Good-bye, gallico the great.
So that's why you took the trick away from me.
I could have stopped you before you booked your first date.
But why didn't you?
Why did you let me go on?
You needed a lesson.
You belong here, not in the theater.
When I stumbled onto you, you were a two-bit concessionaire with a broken-down carny outfit.
All you had was a leaky tent and a bag full of cheap tricks.
I had a lovely wife.
She was the only reason I took a second look at your flea-bitten show.
The only reason you brought me here and gave me a job.
She was a lot different then.
For one thing, she had an innocent mind.
But to you, that meant ignorance, and so you did your best to change it.
She had one great weakness, a consuming hunger for rich living, and I couldn't give her that.
If you'd left us alone, she might have gotten over it, but you catered to it, built it up.
I could see her change before my eyes.
It was no surprise when she asked me for a divorce.
You seemed willing enough.
She didn't try to deceive me.
She told me what she wanted, and I let her have her way.
It couldn't have bothered you much, or you wouldn't have stayed here onthejob.
I loved her, Ross.
Oh, yeah.
That's funny, isn't it?
Yes, it would be, to you.
I knew you, even then.
I knew what could happen.
I stayed on the job to pick up the pieces.
You're lucky i took her off your hands.
Look how she's behaved since I've married her.
Gallivanting all over Europe, spending my money like water.
I haven't seen her in six months.
“Didn't try to deceive you”?
You stupid fool.
She's always been a trollop.
She double-crossed you from the first, just as she double-crossed me.
Don. don, what's the matter with you?
Keep away from me.
You took everything.
Everything I ever had.
My wife! My brains! My self-respect!
Everything but the air I breathe.
“Gallico the great, magician extraordinary.” that's funny, isn't it?
Gallico the clown.
Gallico the stupid fool.
There's one trick you've never seen, Ross.
That no magician has ever dared to try.
But I can't do it alone.
You've got to help me.
In fact, you'll be the star.
- don. Stop it! Don't! - Gallico the great, the magician extraordinary.
- Why don't you laugh at me now?
- Don, the blade.
- Go on! Laugh!
- Don, the blade!
Laugh! Laugh!
Go on! Laugh!
You crazy murderer.
- Laugh! Laugh!
- Murderer! The blade!
- Laugh! Laugh!
- Don, the blade!
"Lau9h! Laugh!
- don! don!
Laugh! Laugh!
Laugh!
Who is it?
It's Karen.
One moment, please.
Hello, don. Ls Alan here?
No. He couldn't wait.
He had an appointment.
Oh, dear. I know I'm late, but I couldn't help it.
I got a job today, working at Siegel-Cooper's store.
Oh. Alan said he would meet you at Tony's restaurant at 6:00.
It's almost that now.
Karen, I want to make you out a check for the time you spent in rehearsal and two weeks' salary in addition.
Oh, well, forget it, don.
I know what this thing has cost you.
No, I want you to have your money, the same as the others.
If there's any change in my plans,
I'll let you know.
Look, don, why don't you come to dinner with us tonight?
It'll do you good.
No, thanks, Karen, but I have something else to do.
Good night, Karen.
Good night, don.
Illusions, incorporated.
Yes, this is Mr. gallico.
Who is this, please?
Dean's Van and storage?
Yes, I have a consignment for Mr. Rinaldi.
I'll be here tonight.
I'll have it ready for you.
Karen.
- Hello there.
- Hello.
Don, you changed your mind.
Karen, you left your bag at the studio and took mine by mistake.
There's something in my bag that's very, very valuable. Where is it?
Oh. don, I...
What's the matter?
What have you done with it?
I left it in the cab.
In a cab?
Do you remember the driver?
No, it was just a hansom cab.
It's all right. The driver will turn it over to the police.
Waiter, bring my check.
- Did you bring a young lady to this restaurant? - Nope.
- How long have you been here?
- About a quarter of an hour.
Did you see a hansom cab leave a young woman here?
Nope.
- Did you?
- Nope.
I did.
- That was ed Burke's rig.
- Where did Burke go?
He picked up a couple who wanted to take a turn through the park.
- Go after him. If you find him,
I'll double that. - Yes, sir.
Let's go.
Hey! Ed! Pull up a minute.
Whoa.
Are you the driver who dropped this young lady in Tony's restaurant?
- Yep.
- She left a black leather bag in your cab.
- She sure did.
- Well, that bag belongs to me.
There's nothing to worry about, mister.
I gave it to a cop.
- You gave it to a cop?
- Yeah, a cop.
The cop at the kiosk, back at Van cortlandt drive and Fordham road.
He'll turn it in at his station.
That's what he said.
Giddap.
Fordham and Van cortlandt.
Yes, sir.
- Hello, don.
- Hello, Karen.
I saw your lights from the street.
Oh, are you going to the victory celebration?
Victory celebration?
Yes. Hudson won from parnell, and there'll be some sort of hijinks on the campus tonight.
You know, some kind of a bonfire and a snake dance.
That's not for me, Karen.
Here, sit down.
I hope you've forgiven me for carrying off your bag.
- You did no harm.
- It was stupid of me.
But I couldn't understand why you let the policeman think that my bag was yours?
You couldn't?
Well, Alan was curious, too.
You know how detectives are.
He questioned me after you left us.
Oh? Well, what about?
Why you were so excited.
You were, you know.
It was all my fault. I've been so worried.
What was in that bag, don?
Do you really want to know, Karen?
It was a head.
A human head.
You're just making fun of me.
Not at all. It was your head, Karen.
The dummy-head I made for the buzz saw trick.
Do you remember how its eyes rolled and the mouth opened in a scream when the teeth of the saw ripped into its flesh?
That was the most lifelike thing I ever made.
Do you think I'm going to let Rinaldi take that away from me, too?
Oh, no, my dear.
He'll never find that lovely head of yours.
Well. I'm glad it was nothing more serious than that.
Oh, Karen.
That celebration tonight, do they build a big bonfire?
Oh, a tremendous one.
Everybody brings fuel for it.
It's terribly exciting.
Yes, I'm sure it must be.
Well, good night, Karen.
Good night, don.
All right, boys, light it.
Toll the bell, here's parnell!
Dead as a doornail, dead as a post!
Dead on the vine, dead in the shell!
Poor parnell, well, well, well!
Toll the bell, here's parnell!
Dead as a doornail, dead as a post!
Dead on the vine, dead in the shell!
Poor parnell, well, well, well!
Toll the bell, here's parnell!
Dead as a doornail...
Mr. ormond.
I thought I recognized you.
Don't you remember me?
Oh, of course. Hello, miss Lee.
Bones found on college campus!
Get your extra here!
Oh, extraordinary, isn't it?
- About these bones they found.
- I beg your pardon?
Well, the other night, after the Hudson-parnell game, they were having a celebration on the campus.
A huge bonfire and, well, that sort of thing, you know.
Yes.
Well, what do you think they found in the ashes the next morning?
- I have no idea.
- Two human shin bones and part of a spine.
- Not really.
- Oh, yes, indeed.
I don't know what we're coming to.
- Do you have some rooms to rent?
- Hmm?
Well, I read this advertisement in the morning paper...
This is your advertisement?
Oh, yes. Yes, of course. Do come in.
Alice!
We don't make a regular thing of renting rooms, but you see, my wife's mother occupied the top floor and...
Well, she's gone on to her reward, and so we have that space on our hands.
- Yes, frank?
- Hmm?
Oh, oh, this gentleman came to see about the room you advertised.
- Mr., uh...
- Jameson. Ward Jameson.
Yes. Mrs. prentiss, my wife.
Oh, yes. Lt's a pleasure, Mr. Jameson.
I'll show you the rooms if you like.
Well, do watch the stairs.
There's no light on the upper landing.
Here we are.
This is the sitting room. The bedroom is in here, with a bath beyond.
Oh, I'm sure you'll be comfortable, and very quiet here.
That's what I'm looking for.
And my husband goes to business, and I'm always busy in my study.
I write, you know.
- You do?
- Yes. Alice prentiss.
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.
You see, I need a place where I can study and do some experimental work.
L'm afraid my habits are not those of the regular businessman.
L'm apt to return late at night, and I may not be here for days at a time.
Oh, that's quite all right.
Would you mind if I moved in right now?
I have everything I need.
But I haven't told you what I want for the rooms.
Anything you say.
Well, let me see. With maid services and everything, I had thought...
- Fifty a month?
- Fifty a month?
In advance, of course.
Oh, that's very good of you.
You've no idea what a relief it is to find just the place I need, where I can come and go as I please and be left alone.
People are always so determined to poke into your business.
I could see at once that you're not that kind.
Oh, no, no, indeed.
Uh, I'll get you a receipt.
Anytime at all.
Well, it looks like the deal is closed.
Everything is satisfactory, frank.
Oh, Mr. Jameson, have you had supper?
- No, but I...
- L'll get you some.
Oh, please don't bother.
It's no bother.
I'll have the maid bring it up.
Thank you.
Charming woman.
Oh, yes, yes. I say, did Alice tell you that she writes?
Yes, she did.
Murder mysteries. Oh, she's full of plots.
Morning, noon and night. That's all i ever hear. Plots, plots, plots.
Oh, oh, I say, here.
Here's her latest, murder is a must'.
- Rather good title, don't you think?
- Very good.
- Yes, it sold over a hundred thousand copies. - Vvhat does it mean?
Well, it's about a chap who murders a chap, and then, so not to be found out, he has to kill another one and then another one, and, well, that's the way it goes, ad infinitum, ad nauseam.
However, it's rather cute the way she dreams these things up.
I say, Alice has a theory that all murderers are crazy.
So?
Well, I don't know about that.
Well, maybe we all have a bit of it in us, and maybe if it wasn't for the law, we'd all go round killing each other.
I say, there's another good plot, don't you think?
Well, I do hope you like it here,
Mr. Jameson.
Thank you.
Hello, Claire.
The village blacksmith.
Mmm.
Not bad.
Absence makes the heart beat faster.
Are you glad to see me, darling?
Very glad.
Well, you don't show it.
At least I would expect a compliment.
You look terribly expensive.
Now you sound like my second husband.
Shall we cheat him a little bit, darling?
I don't think so.
What's the matter?
Don't you love me anymore?
I'll always love what you were.
But not what I am?
Well, I think I'm rather nice.
Lots of people do.
What are you working on?
A new trick.
Is the studio making money?
It's doing very well.
Good. Good.
I suppose you know that Ross has left me.
Can you blame him?
Yes, and so would you, if you would react normally.
Have you forgotten that I was once your wife?
L'm not likely to.
Don, he's hiding from me.
I've got to find him.
I'll get even for both of us.
Tell me where he is.
I don't know.
You don't know.
You're afraid of him.
Yes, I think you are.
You know...
You know, I often wondered why you let him make a fool of you and turned the other cheek.
Perhaps you knew all the time what was going on and didn't have the courage to do anything about it.
Don.
- What's happened to you?
- I didn't want to do that, Claire.
Now, you'd better get out of here.
But I read in the paper where Mrs.
Ross ormond had returned from Europe and found that her husband was missing.
I said to myself, “oh, you poor little creature, if only I could help you.”
Mrs. prentiss loves to help people.
And turned the other cheek.
It was rather smudgy.
No, thank you.
It was a rather smudgy happiness.
And then, Mr. ormond was wearing his whiskers in a different style, but there was something about that face that rang a bell.
She... she... she studied it under a microscope.
It was then that I determined to write to you and ask you to come here.
Oh, of course, this roomer may not be your husband, but it's well worth investigating.
What name did he use?
Ward Jameson.
What did he look like?
Oh, he's a very striking man.
The moment I laid eyes on him, i said, “there's a character.”
I collect characters.
I'm a writer, you know.
- Murder mysteries.
- Alice prentiss.
Oh. Here's a picture of my husband.
Lt's a much newer one.
Frank. Frank, what did I tell you?
I knew it in my bones.
Yes, my dear, in your bones.
This is the man, Mrs. ormond.
Is he here now?
Oh, no, no.
He spends very little time here, but he did tell the maid that he'd be in late tonight, very late.
Oh, my dear, you... you do want to make up with him, don't you?
Why, of course. Lf only he'd let me.
I don't think that will be too difficult.
Frank.
Yes, dear?
Oh, yes, my dear.
Now, my dear child,
I've handled situations like this in dozens of my books, and they always turn out in a very interesting way.
Oh?
- Frank.
- Huh? What?
Shh. He's here.
Ross.
What is the matter?
Can't you speak?
Or is the shock of seeing me too much for you?
What are you doing here?
What am I doing here?
Well, after all, I'm your wife.
Where would I be but with my husband?
How did you find me?
Well, that was easy.
You shouldn't have rented rooms from a woman who writes.
You might have guessed she'd be curious about you.
Do the prentisses know you're here?
Why, of course, my darling.
Who are you?
You're not Ross.
You're don, aren't you?
It's amazing. Incredible.
I think it would fool anybody in the world, with one exception.
The woman who lived with both of you.
Why are you masquerading like this?
Are you trying to help him against me?
Where is he?
Well, don't stand there staring at me. Answer me.
He's dead.
Yes.
You killed him.
Yes.
Aren't they going to find him?
I don't think so.
It's all right, don.
You don't have to worry about me.
I would never turn you in.
Did you think that i wanted him for myself?
I wanted his money, and now I've got it.
You've made me a very rich woman, don, and I could love you for it.
I could love you all over again.
Why, I know... I know
I've been rotten to you.
I made a terrible mistake.
I'll make up for it.
We could get married again.
We could be happy.
We can buy anything we want.
My poor, dear Claire.
Don.
Don't you know i wouldn't dare trust you?
No! No!
Mr. ormond! Mr. ormond!
Open the door!
Frank! Frank, do something!
Here. Here.
Get the police.
Yes, my dear.
Thank you.
Er... Mr. gallico...
Mrs. ormond was your former wife.
Yes, sir.
Do you believe ormond killed her?
Apparently he was with her when she died.
Mr. prentiss, you'll testify to that?
Oh, we have to, inspector.
We heard their voices.
We heard her call him by his name: Ross.
Why should he kill her? Tell me that.
I think I can show you that ormond convicted himself.
Now, he's going to show you his newfangled fingerprints.
It was adopted officially by the French, two years ago.
No two sets of prints are alike.
Come here and I'll show you what I mean.
Now, here's a print of the index finger of ormond's right hand.
Where did you get it?
From articles ormond handled while he was rooming with the prentisses.
Now, here's a second print taken from another source and blown up to the same size.
You will notice that the prints match each other, line for line.
I found this print on the surface of a gold bracelet that belonged to Mrs. ormond.
I remember the bracelet.
She was wearing it the night she was killed.
Well, we know the man we want.
The job is to find him.
That'll be all, thank you.
Oh, uh, don't leave town.
We may call you anytime.
Good day, everybody.
I suppose you found the same fingerprints in ormond's house?
Yes. In his own room.
Fresh ones, apparently.
He must have made them the night he packed a bag and moved into your house.
Are you sure it was Ross ormond you rented rooms to?
I identified his photograph.
Yes, but you could have been mistaken.
You are not infallible, madame.
Now, if you'll excuse me, i have an audience waiting for me.
I hope they hiss him off the stage.
Oh, Mr. gallico.
Your work simply fascinates me.
It's so unusual.
I wonder if I could visit your studio sometime.
Why, of course. When I have something interesting to show you,
I'll get in touch with you.
Oh, thank you so much.
Good-bye.
Alice. Alice. What are you up to?
Oh, nothing, my dear.
Nothing at all.
He's an odd character.
I may put him in a book.
Besides,
I have the strangest feeling that I've known him before.
Hello. Mr. prentiss? Oh, this is gallico.
Tomorrow morning at 11:00 I'm staging a sort of dress rehearsal in my studio of a new trick I've been building, and remembering your wife's request,
I'm inviting you both to be present.
Can you come?
Well, Mrs. prentiss isn't here at the moment, but I'm sure I can speak for her.
Almost sure.
Uh, we'd be delighted,
Mr. gallico. Delighted.
This is the first private showing of a new illusion
I've built for my own use in the theater.
Karen knows how it works, and she's going to assist me.
But for the most part, the machine you will see is automatic.
Until it is shown in the theater, i must keep it a secret so that no other magician can steal the idea.
This audience had to be one I could trust, and Karen suggested that I invite you.
Oh, Mr. gallico, we're so flattered.
Yes, this is quite an event.
Sit down, please.
Well, here we go.
Gallico the great presents his sensational new illusion, “the crematorium”.
This device feeds the body, which is to be destroyed, into the fire chamber of the crematorium.
Once inside, it releases the body, leaves it there, and then withdraws.
But unless the machine is shut off, it automatically repeats the performance within 40 seconds.
Gas is the fuel, operating under a forced draft of oxygen.
It takes a few moments for the heat to build up, but once it gets started, it develops a temperature of 3500 degrees fahrenheit.
All right, Karen. You take over.
Well, how did you like it?
Well clone, gallico. Well clone.
- How did you get in here?
- Through the door.
Then you knew that I was showing this trick.
Oh, yes. I have ways of finding out what goes on.
Can you blame me for being curious?
Take it easy, gallico.
There's no harm done.
We'll see about that.
Did you like it?
It was terribly exciting.
Oh, but isn't it dangerous?
Of course, I knew it wasn't you in there while the burning was going on, but supposing your escape device didn't work and you oouldn't get out?
What then?
The assistant controls the magician's escape.
She lets the boss out just as the flame comes on.
And what if she doesn't like the boss?
Ashes to ashes.
This thing is more than an illusion.
It really works.
Oh, it's... it's still hot.
I say, where did you get the idea for this crematorium?
From a crematory.
The heat principle is the same.
It does more than burn. It disintegrates.
Oh, thanks for inviting us.
It was a wonderful show.
But we must be running along.
Oh, by the way, have you gentlemen heard anything new about our murder case?
They're still hunting ormond.
Do you know, I'm beginning to believe that that man is dead.
No one could disappear so completely.
Want to share a cab with us, Karen?
Yes, I'm coming.
Oh, it was so sweet of you.
Yes, thanks again.
- Thank you, Karen.
- Good night.
Not bad, gallico.
Not bad at all.
Of course, it needs work, but I know you'll get the bugs out of it.
Yeah, I'll have the lithograph people send an artist over here to make me some sketches for a new poster.
“The great Rinaldi presents his shocking new illusion...
The crematorium!” save yourself the trouble.
You'll never get your hands on this one.
Do you really think so?
You know, gallico, that prentiss woman is nobody's fool.
I believe she came close to the truth about ormond.
If he were alive, he'd need money.
He wouldn't dare go to his bank, nor would he go to you, I think.
But he'd surely come to me.
I'm his partner.
Not that he'd trust me particularly, but he'd know I wouldn't turn him in.
Because, you see, he had a couple of things on me.
Ross ormond was a cold, calculating customer.
He'd ditch a woman, but he'd never kill her.
No woman could mean that much to him.
He might kick her out of his house, but he'd never move out himself.
You see, I know these things because I knew him.
I knew Claire.
I know you.
You're the kind who loves deeply, believes in the sanctity of the home, suffers in silence, broods and waits.
You had every reason to hate him.
What did you do with him, gallico?
How did you get rid of it?
Was this thing already built and hidden away?
Waiting for a job like that?
Ormond was seen alive two weeks ago.
The prentisses identified him.
- That didn't have to be him.
- Who else could it have been?
It could have been you, gallico.
From what ormond told me, you are a clever mimic, developed a wonderful new makeup, something new in the theater.
Something that might be used offstage, too.
Only a man who dreams up illusions would think of such a thing, and only people of the theater would know it was possible.
Lieutenant Bruce thinks he has ormond's fingerprints.
What if he should think to compare them with yours?
This belongs to me.
And so does everything that comes out of that brain of yours.
From now on you're a private enterprise.
Ah, I may incorporate you.
Get your souvenir programs here.

Souvenir programs of the great Rinaldi, the one and only Rinaldi.
- Mr. Rinaldi.
- Oh, lieutenant. How do you do?
L'm fine, thank you.
It sounded like a good matinee out there.
Yes, we were sold out as usual.
I wonder if I could see you for a moment.
I have an evening performance.
I must rest.
Of course, but I actually mean a moment.
L'm not looking for an autograph.
This is police business.
Very well.
Please, uh, sit down.
You will pardon me if I change while you are here.
Of course.
Mr. Rinaldi, you've said repeatedly you don't believe Ross ormond killed his wife.
That is correct.
Do you still hold that opinion?
I am not sure that I do.
Did you have any reason to suspect that some other person might have been with Mrs. ormond when she was killed?
Why do you ask that?
Have you found new evidence?
No, but let's say I've hit upon a new theory.
But you were so positive it was ormond.
You showed us his fingerprints.
I showed you what I assumed to be his prints.
To make sure I'm on the right track,
I want a set of fingerprints from every person who was well acquainted with Mrs. ormond.
That includes you and Mr. gallico.
I have my equipment here with me.
But what right have you to ask that of me?
Am I a suspect?
Well, no, of course not.
What possible use could you make of my prints?
Don't you understand? They can prove a person innocent as well as guilty.
I do not have to prove my innocence.
Don't you want this case solved?
That is police business, not mine.
And now, if you will excuse me, lieutenant.
Just as you say, sir.
Sorry to have troubled you.
Thanks for letting me see you.
Judas priest.
Sir, I've got something to show you.
Well, all right, what is it?
What have you found?
Today at the 44th street theater,
I asked Rinaldi to let me take his fingerprints and he refused.
Rinaldi. What the devil?
Sir, please. Will you listen?
After he left the theater, i broke into his dressing room and photographed some prints from objects on his makeup table.
This is one of them.
This is ormond's.
Ormond and Rinaldi are the same man.
That's the craziest thing i ever heard.
You can see for yourself.
The prints are exactly the same.
Which proves that you can't depend on that method of identification.
But you can, sir. The fingerprints of different persons are never the same.
L'm going to bring in Rinaldi and hold him on a suspicion of murder.
On evidence like this? Do you want to make a laughingstock of the department?
The system's too new.
We don't know enough about it.
At least let me assign a couple of men to watch him. Let me make sure of him.
All right. All right.
But don't make an arrest until you get the goods on him.
And I don't mean fingerprints.
But how you can work in the same room where that poor girl was killed is beyond me.
The thoughts of a murderer and his victim are supposed to linger on the atmosphere of a room.
Why, I... I getjust the mood i want in here.
Well, you can have it.
Good luck on your murderer.
Oh, I say, there was a very nice one in the fall river thing.
The killer used an ax, and...
Oh, no, no, no, no, don't tell me now, frank. Save it.
I shall.
Frank!
- Do they know who did it?
- Know who?
Oh, oh, no. Some neighbor saw him, but he was wearing a mask.
His impersonation of the man he had killed was perfect.
The mask he wore was equally perfect.
Another face that fitted him like an outer skin.
Thin as tissue and elastic enough
to give with every move of the facial muscles.
Frank. Frank.
Frank, I've got it.
- Your... Your plot?
- No. What actually happened.
Remember I told you how much Mr.
Gallico reminded me of ormond?
Yes.
Well, there had to be a reason for that, and I think I know what it is.
They've never found a trace of ormond. I don't believe that he was ever in this house.
I believe it was gallico who rented those rooms upstairs.
Wearing greasepaint makeup?
Oh, no, frank, no. You were right about that. It had to be more than a makeup.
I think it was a mask.
Alice.
A face, I mean. The face of ormond.
That must have been his secret.
How else could he have made those quick changes in his show?
I don't believe it. It is too incredible.
But I'm convinced of it. So convinced that
I'm going to lieutenant Bruce right now.
Alice, I forbid it.
My dear, don't be ridiculous.
Karen should be here soon.
I'll be honest with you, Mrs. prentiss.
Lt's my job to follow up every lead I get, but I'm afraid your theory is going to steer us right up a blind alley.
I was worried about it myself, until you told me that the fingerprints of ormond and Rinaldi were one and the same.
Doesn't that mean they were made by one man?
Yes, it does and it could be gallico, but...
I'll find out about that before this night's over.
- Hello, Karen.
- Hello. Now, look here, Alan...
Honey, I'm sorry to have to drag you down here at this hour.
I should think you would be sorry.
What you told me on the phone about Mr. gallico is simply impossible.
Why, he's the kindest, sweetest man I've ever known.
What he told you on the phone was my theory, not his, Karen.
Well, how can you even think such a thing?
L'm sorry. I like Mr. gallico, too.
Now, listen to me, Karen.
When gallico impersonated other magicians in his show, what method did he use to make himself look like them?
Well, I don't know. He always kept it a secret from the rest of the company.
He always changed in his dressing room.
Do you think he used a mask?
No. How could he even talk or move his face with a mask on?
It would have to be a special kind of mask.
What of it? Suppose he did use one?
He never killed anybody.
He couldn't do such a thing.
Mrs. prentiss thinks that gallico might be in there right now on the stage impersonating Rinaldi.
That's utterly ridiculous.
I hope you're right.
Let's go take a look.
You know gallico better than I do.
Better than any of us.
Tell us... What do you think?
Well?
I don't understand it.
He does some things very much like Mr. gallico.
Mrs. prentiss may be right.
Now, if gallico's prints should match those of ormond and Rinaldi...
I'm going to gallico's studio.
May I go with you? Well, don't you think I've earned that reward?
Karen, do something for me.
Wait at the stage door till Rinaldi comes out.
Then talk to him.
Say anything you can think of, but keep him as long as you can.
In case he is gallico.
Come on, Mrs. prentiss.
Oh, don. don.
Why, hello, Karen.
What are you doing here?
Why, I was waiting for Mr. Rinaldi.
L'm... l'm looking for a job.
You see, I haven't done very much work lately, except a little modeling.
So I thought there might be something in this show.
Oh? Well, that's too bad.
I came here to see
Rinaldi myself, but he's gone.
Oh, I didn't see him leave.
No, they told me that he came out through the front.
- Can I drop you some place, Karen?
- Oh, no. No, thank you.
Well, I'm going straight home, and you live near my place.
It's much better than waiting here for a bus.
Come on. Get in.
Well, you're not afraid of riding with me, are you, Karen?
What's your address?
29 palisades Avenue.
How's our friend the detective?
Alan? Oh... He's all right.
He's having a little trouble finding his murderer, isn't he?
Considerable trouble.
Looks all right.
A matter of opinion.
Come in. That's the door to gallico's apartment.
See if there's a rear exit.
We may have to get out of here in a hurry.
L get you.
- Well, thanks for the lift, don.
- That's all right.
Go to bed now and get a good night's rest.
I shall. Thanks.
Good night, Karen.
Good night, don.
457 rensselaer drive.
Yes. Mm-hmm. Sure.
Well. Mm-hmm.
Good evening, miss Lee.
Hello.
I knew it.
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.
Hello.
This is Karen. Gallicds on the way to the studio. He'll be there any minute.
You'd better hurry and get out of there quick.
All right, Karen. L'll tell Bruce.
Well, lieutenant?
L'm sorry, Mr. gallico.
I decided to get fingerprints from all those who had known Mrs. ormond.
I asked Rinaldi for a set of his.
What did he say?
Oh, he was very angry.
I was afraid I might get the same reception from you.
You policemen don't trust anybody.
Why, lieutenant, I haven't the slightest objection to giving you my prints.
That's very nice of you.
Do you have an ink pad here?
Yes. Yes, of course.
Here you are.
And here's some paper.
Anything else you want?
We'll take your left hand first.
Just roll it on the pad, then make an imprint on the paper, so...
I'm glad to help you, lieutenant.
I... I want you to solve this case.
Next, the index finger of the left hand.
You know, I have a high regard for you, lieutenant.
I'll always have a high regard for you.
Even though we should have a slight misunderstanding.
You shouldn't have come here, lieutenant.
L'm afraid I'll have to dispose of you.
Ah, lieutenant, so you're with us again.
It's a pity I had to deal with you the way I did, but one must be firm with policemen.
Give them an inch and they'll take a mile.
Gallico, you'll get the chair for this.
They'll give me the same voltage for killing four as they would for killing three.
Ormond. His wife. The great Rinaldi.
You should have seen how neatly this machine disposed of him.
In no time at all he was a handful of ashes.
Karen. Karen. Up here.
Bruce is hurt.
I'm afraid gallico will kill him.
- I'll go and get a policeman.
- No, no, there isn't time for that.
Go to the front of the studio.
Bang on the door.
Anything to get gallico's attention.
Hurry! Hurry!
You shouldn't have come nosing around here, lieutenant.
Takes a little time for a job like this, but I set the machine at 3500 degrees fahrenheit.
When it nears that point, this door will open.
When it is fully opened, the machine will roll you in.
Actually, there will be very little pain.
Such a blast of heat brings instant oblivion.
Can you hear it sing, lieutenant?
It has the voice of a mad bull.
As you can see, my crematorium is more than an illusion.
You haven't seen it work, have you?
But you will. You'll be in it.
Gallico, you don't know what you're doing.
Yes, I know. They'll say
I'm mad, quite mad.
They'll lock me in jail for life, put me in a padded cell with a straitjacket.
No, thank you.
I'll take the chair.
Who's there? Who is it?
What do you want?
Mr. gallico, please!
Mr. gallico, please open the door!
I can't see you now.
Get away from here.
I'll get the police!
Please open the door!
You don't know what you're doing!
Help! Police!
Help! Help! Help! Help!
Bruce, are you all right?
Oh!
They are remarkable likenesses,
but l'll never believe a man could get away with such a thing.
You didn't believe the fingerprints either.
You confused me.
You told me that ormond's and Rinaldi's prints were the same.
They were. Because they were both made by gallico.
Don't take too much credit.
If it hadn't been for Mrs. prentiss, you wouldn't be alive to tell the tale, and that's exactly what I'm going to tell the newspapers, my dear lady.
Oh, no, inspector. I won't let you.
But be sure and mention my new book, murder is a must'.
So nice seeing you again.
I'd better be going.
Oh, dear me, I haven't everything that I brought in with me.
Let me see.
Oh, yes, of course. Here it is.
Come, frank.
Cornelia Van Gorder
(Voiceover): This is the Oaks, a house in the country which
I rented for the summer.
As an author, I write tales of mystery and murder.
But the things that happened in this house were far more fantastic than any story I've ever had published.
I brought a staff of servants from my city apartment, and my maid Lizzy Allen who had been with me nearly 20 years.
Lizzy?
Yes, Miss Cornelia?
Cornelia Van Gorder:
Is the car ready?
It's at the door.
Look.
Hm?
Miss Cornelia, them servants you brought from the apartment are talking about walking out on us.
Really?
Well, I know they don't like it here.
But I didn't think it was that bad.
Well, they've been hearing things about the killer that the police call the Bat, and the murders that he committed here this past winter.
Now people are saying he's back again.
Well, how can they be sure of that?
Has he committed another crime?
No, not yet, but that ain't saying that he won't.
Here's something else.
You've heard about the bats they have here--
Animal bats, the kind that fly.
Yes, yes.
Look what it says in this magazine.
This is a report from the state health department.
And it says some of them bats is rabid.
Well.
And that ain't all.
Now there's a rumor going around that it was the Bat himself, the killer I mean, that released the rabid bats in this neighborhood.
Oh, that's ridiculous.
Well, the housekeeper, the cook, the butler, and the upstairs maid don't think so.
Well, I can't help what they think.
If hysterical nonsense like that can scare them out of their good jobs, it's their loss not mine.
Come on, Lizzy.
I've got to get to the bank.
Drive directly to
Zenith bank, Warner.
I'm afraid we'll have to hurry.
It's near closing time.
I'll get you there,
Miss Van Gorder.
Thanks again.
Miss Van Gorder!
How are you doing, Mr. Bailey?
How are you?
I'm very well, thank you.
You remember Lizzy Allen?
Of course, hello, Miss Allen.
How do you do?
So you're spending the summer with us again?
Yes, yes, I've leased the
Oaks, the home of your bank president, John Fleming.
I heard you had.
I was surprised.
Why?
Is there something the matter with it?
No, I was surprised because Mr. Fleming said he would never rent it.
Oh?
Well I rented it from his nephew mark
Fleming who has the real estate office here.
He said his uncle would be gone the entire summer.
That's right.
Mr. Fleming's in the north woods now, with his physician
Dr. Wells.
Oh, pardon me.
Dale?
I want you to meet my wife.
We were married at Christmas time.
That must have been nice.
Believe me, it was.
Oh, here she is-- my wife,
Ms. Van Gorder, Ms. Allen.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Cornelia Van Gorder.
Yes.
Oh, well I've read every murder mystery you've ever written.
I just adored that weird one, the private morgue of Dr. X, even though it gave me the shivers.
Only the shivers?
Scared hell out of me.
Oh.
Well, I really need that
Miss Corny killed them off in that one.
When you refer to my books, please don't call me Miss Corny.
Pardon me, Mr. Bailey.
My.
Hynes is here to see you.
Oh yes, excuse me, please.
Don't be strangers now.
No, no we won't.
Oh, so you're a bride?
Well, not quite.
Not since Christmas.
I'm sure I've seen you.
Well, I-- I used to be my husband's secretary here in the bank.
Cornelia Van Gorder:
Of course, I remember.
May I welcome our most distinguished visitor back to Zenith?
Oh, that's very charming.
But, um--
Lieutenant Anderson.
Lieutenant Anderson, of course, chief of detectives of the
Zenith police department.
This is Miss Allen.
How do you do?
Lieutenant Anderson is one of our favorite citizens.
He's on the bank's board of directors.
Not bad for a policeman.
You must have made a good thing of it.
Well, I saved my money, if that's what you mean.
It's near closing time.
And I've got some business in the safe deposit vault. Please come and see me, Mrs. Bailey.
Oh, I'd love to.
And you, Lieutenant.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, nice to have met you.
My, what a charming woman.
She moved into the Oaks just the other day.
That house is a proper sitting for a writer of mysteries.
Oh, it certainly is.
Dick, what's the matter?
Come in here, both of you.
Andy, we're in trouble.
Wendell hynes came in to pick up $350,000 worth of bonds that we were holding as collateral for a loan.
They were kept in our special fault.
Mr. Fleming and I are the only officers of the bank who have access to that vault.
So?
The hynes bonds are gone.
That's not all.
Other negotiable securities are missing.
From what I can gather short of a careful check, the bank has been looted of over a million dollars worth of securities.
You'll have to notify Fleming.
I wish I could talk to him.
Unfortunately, he and Dr.
Wells are deep in the woods.
They can't be reached by phone.
What is it?
I thought I heard someone on the path coming from the lake, had an idea it might be that guide of ours.
Oh, Sam won't show up until morning.
It's a 20-mile canoe trip from here to civilization.
Five will get you 10
Sam has a message for me.
I thought you told them at the bank not to bother you.
I did.
But they'll bother me.
Doctor?
Yes, John.
What would you do for half a million?
Anything short of murder.
Why not murder?
Too messy.
Dr. hynes: Too great a risk?
For half a million?
Yes.
I pinched a million from the bank.
I'm not kidding.
I embezzled it.
Not that I think you wouldn't do it if you thought you could get away with it.
I got away with it.
I'm not talking about currency.
I took negotiable securities that could be converted into cash.
I have the cash, in tens, twenties, and hundreds.
I'm your doctor, not your lawyer.
Why tell me this?
You'll find out why.
Who's going to take the blame for the robbery?
Bailey, the cashier,l they'll never suspect me.
I like Bailey.
Well, so do i. I love the guy.
I gave him his first chance.
He has a lovely little wife.
Charming girl, I was the best man.
Where's the million?
In my family's tomb in Zenith, in the crypt with my father's casket.
I don't buy that, John.
No?
No, you forget that
I had you in charge when you were a very sick man, when you raved in delirium.
And I heard you talk about a hidden room.
Now, where else could you put a hidden room except in that mansion you built, that white elephant you call the Oaks?
Look, everyone knows
I have a bad heart.
Who would doubt it if you wired the bank directors that my heart had failed, that
I had fallen from a great height here in the woods, and that
I was badly smashed up?
You could ship the body back for burial, and instruct them not to open the casket due to the condition of its contents.
Well, you realize, of course, that we'd have to have a body to put in that casket, which means that we'd have to deal with an undertaker at this end.
Of course.
But where do we get a body?
Couldn't we provide one of our own?
How about Sam?
Sam?
Our guide?
Sam weighs about as much as I do.
He's practically a hermit.
He wouldn't be missed for a long time.
The local undertaker would know him.
Dr. hynes: Not if we made him look as if he'd been in a serious accident.
But if Bailey's going to take the blame, why do you have to do this?
A jury might acquit him.
In that case, I'd be a logical suspect.
I could disappear, of course.
But it's safer if they think I'm dead.
What if I don't go for this deal?
In that case, it would be two bad.
You mean you'd kill me?
What else could I do?
Now that I've told you about the million.
I'd say you were shot in a hunting accident.
Now, look, doctor, it you can find another body instead of Sam's, it's all right with me.
There's half a million in it for you.
I'll do my best.
I smell smoke.
So do i. What's that noise?
Look, doctor!
The woods are on fire!
It's coming this way!
We've got to get out of here!
Out the back way!
We will, as soon as
I provide that body we were talking about.
Oh, my goodness dear,
Lizzie, is that you?
Yes, Miss cordelia.
There's a storm coming up.
And it's going to be a snorter.
The wind nearly blew the door off its hinges.
Well, that noise blew my game higher than a kite.
I think I've lost some of the cards.
Oh, I'll get them for you.
Oh, I see you've found the paper.
Drat that paper boy, scooting by on his bicycle, just chucked it into a couple bushes and let it go at that.
For land's sake, Mr. Vick
Bailey's been arrested.
Oh?
Right there.
Victor Bailey, vice president and cashier of the Zenith bank, was arraigned before united states commissioner Alvin fielding charged with the embezzlement of over $1 million.
I can't believe Vick
Bailey had anything to do with that robbery.
Oh, well, I see our landlord is home again.
Landlord?
Mr. Fleming, Dr. Malcolm
Wells is back in town with the body of John
Fleming, president of the Zenith bank, who was killed in a forest fire.
Mr. Fleming will be laid to rest in his family's tomb on Friday.
And I hope he stays there.
Why shouldn't he?
Well, this is his house.
And ever since he died, some funny things have happened here.
For instance?
The housekeeper, the cook, and the butler said that they heard strange noises at night.
And the upstairs maid swore that she met a man without a face coming up the back stairs.
Oh, so that's why they quit and left me to run this place without a staff.
They didn't tell you, Ms. Corny.
But the truth is, they were scared to stay.
But you're still here, Lizzie.
Haven't you seen anything?
No, no, and even if I had,
I ain't afraid of ghosts.
They're afraid of me.
Honest, Ms. Corny, a spiritualist told me once that ghosts was allergic to me.
But-- but this Bat feller they keep talking about in the paper,
I-- I guess he'd be different.
I don't think you would have the same effect on him.
Oh dear.
What are they trying to do, drive people away from this part of the country?
Why?
What does it say about the Bat?
His specialty seems to be killing women-- my goodness, two of them in one night.
All his victims died the same way, like their throats had been ripped open with steel claws.
Well, that's a charming little caper.
I'll have to try it sometime.
In a book.
That aint' nothing, just something bumping against the house.
That's just the wind banging a door.
Pay no attention to it.
Listen to this, one of his victims who lived for a moment after she was found, described the Bat as a man without a face.
Honest, Ms. Corny,
I think that woman must have been exaggerating.
That's just that heavy tapestry at the top of the stairs.
I know.
I know.
I've heard it before on a windy night.
But that sounds as if there was someone on the stairs.
I know there isn't, at least there shouldn't be.
There ain't.
Them's just the noises you here in any old house on a windy night.
It says here that the Bat never leaves no fingerprints.
That's understandable.
Having no face, he probably has no fingers either.
Lizzie!
And that, I suppose, is the cat dropping its dentures?
No, no, I don't think so.
But I think it's something should be looked into.
Now, who chucked him down here?
The wind, I hope.
There must be a window open up there.
No, Lizzie!
Let him lay.
Let him sleep it off.
I hope the power lines don't go down, put the lights out.
We'll check the windows in the living room, and drawn the curtains, and then we'll go to bed.
Yes, ma'am.
I won't be a minute.
Ms. Corny!
What was that?
Oh, when I went to get the paper, I turned the latch off.
I forgot to turn it on again.
He's out there.
He was coming in.
He might have got you.
Oh, but he didn't.
And he's still out there, thanks to you.
Now, you hurry now, and we'll call the police.
No, no, I won't leave you, Ms. Corny.
Are you ok?
Yes, ma'am, I'm ok.
Ok.
Operator: Operator?
Give me the police department, please.
Officer: Zenith police department.
This is Cornelia Van Gorder.
I'm living at the Oaks.
We know about that,
Ms. Van Gorder.
Just a moment ago, a man tried to force his way into this house.
Officer: You're not alone there, are you?
What about your servants?
Well, I have none except my chauffeur.
And he's away.
He won't be back until the morning.
Now, there's only two of us here tonight.
And we're going to lock ourselves in my room.
Now, uh, if-- if any of your men see anything, will you have them call me?
Officer: I'll send officers over there right away.
Well, thank you very much.
Come on, Lizzie.
We're going to sleep in my room.
Well, nothing can get at us in this room now, I don't think.
This door seems good and solid.
Like the door to a tomb.
Uh, I think that couch will be comfortable.
There's some extra bedding, you know, in the closet.
Let's see now.
Oh, uh-huh, no bolt.
Well, that's not so good.
What's that for?
That, my good woman, is a boobie trap.
If anybody tries to open this transom, this'll be knocked off.
And we'll hear it fall.
Oh, fiddlesticks, I forgot my night things, my robe, my gown, and my slippers.
I'll go get them now.
Now, wait a minute, Lizzie.
I'll go with you--
Now don't you bother, Ms. Cornelia.
My room's just down the hall.
Cornelia Van Gorder:
Lizzie, I told you to wait!
It's all right.
I'll only be a second.
Get in here!
Get in here!
Yes?
Officer: Miss Van Gorder?
Yes.
Officer: Zenith police department.
There's a police car just outside your house.
And the officers in it have reported that there's no sign of a prowler anywhere well, the man's inside now!
He's in the hall just outside my bedroom!
Have your men break through the kitchen door and search this place from top to bottom.
Officer: Ok, Ms. Van
Gorder, sit tight.
I will.
I have a gun.
And I know how to use it.
Oh, relax, relax, Lizzie.
The police did a good job.
They couldn't find anybody in here.
But we both saw him, Ms. Cornelia.
All right, all right, so he got away.
But there are men on guard outside.
So just try and get some rest.
There's nothing can get at us here.
Oh, oh, oh, Miss cordelia!
Miss cordelia!
What?
What's the matter?
A bat!
Oh, nonsense, you've had a nightmare.
Maybe I did.
But there was a bat.
And it bit me.
What?
It flew in that closet.
Oh, good gracious, Lizzie.
You're right!
Operator, operator, will you get me Dr. Malcolm Wells' office, please.
I don't know his number.
And I have no phone book up here.
But this is an emergency.
Will you connect me with his office, please?
Oh dear, oh dear, I'm going to get the rabies.
Woman: Hello?
Hello?
Dr. well's office.
Woman: This is a call service.
Dr. Wells is out at moment.
But if you give me your name and number, I'll try to locate him.
Well, this is Miss
Van Gorder of the Oaks.
My maid has just been bitten by a bat that may be rapid.
And she must have treatment as soon as possible.
And I was told that Dr. Wells was the nearest physician.
Woman: I'll try to find him for you.
And I can't, I'll send you another doctor.
Well, thank you very much.
Oh, he's out on a case.
Oh.
I hope it's not a delivery-- a baby, I mean.
They can be terribly complicated.
It never bothered me none.
Oh, Lizzie, you never had a baby.
Of course I didn't.
That's why they never bothered me.
Oh, does it hurt, huh?
A little.
Operator: Dr. Wells?
Are you there Dr. Wells?
Are you there, Dr. Wells?
This is the operator.
Your call service is on the wire.
It's an emergency.
This is Dr. Wells.
Woman: This is your call service, doctor.
Oh, hello I-- I was just doing an experiment.
I left the receiver off.
Woman: That's what I thought, but I kept trying.
Ms. Van Gorder at the Oaks called and said that her maid had been bitten by a bit.
And she's afraid it might be rapid.
What?
Oh, all right, tell her
I'll be right over there.
Who's there?
Dr. Wells: Dr. Wells.
Come in.
Good evening.
Oh, I'm so glad they found you, doctor.
Well, I reached my office shortly after you called.
How is your maid?
Is she in any pain?
No, no, she doesn't seem to be.
Did the bat get away?
No.
I believe it's still in my bedroom.
Oh, good, I'll want to examine it.
There you go, Ms. Allen.
Now you'll feel better.
Doctor, have I got the rabies?
Well, I can tell you better after I've examined the bat's brain under a microscope.
That thing's got a brain?
Oh, you'd be surprised.
Where is it?
I think the little darling is in that closet.
Oh.
You know, it's a pity you leased this house, Ms. Van Gorder.
Why a pity?
Well, my dear lady, I don't want to alarm you, but--
Oh, well after tonight, nothing can alarm me.
Yes, I understand.
It must have been terrifying.
So many unexplainable things have happened here.
There's something about the place.
Your servants must have sensed it when they walked out on you, an apprehension of disaster.
Well, let's see.
Ah-ha!
Yes, there he is.
All right now, take it easy, nobody's going to hurt you, quiet now, quiet.
Looks quite normal, doesn't seem to be sick at all.
Ain't that nice.
I've been worried about him.
Well, you should be.
From his appearance,
I'd say that he doesn't have any infection, in which case you've had a narrow escape.
Now, you take one of those tablets
I left for you and I guarantee you a good night.
And I'll drop in on you tomorrow.
Oh, thanks for everything, doctor.
But I can find my way out.
I know you can.
But do let me help you.
Oh, don't forget that once I'm gone, you'll have to climb those stairs alone.
Oh, I'm all right.
I'm armed now.
Can you shoot one of those things without shutting your eyes?
Oh, doctor, there are guns in every book I've ever written.
I don't write about things
I'm unfamiliar with.
Lock the door, Lizzie.
Goodnight.
Yes, ma'am, good night, doctor.
Accident?
No, no, the wind blew him down, I think.
Oh.
Did you know that young mark
Fleming leased you this house without notifying his uncle?
No, no, I didn't.
Well, it doesn't matter now.
John Fleming is dead.
And mark's his heir.
But if John were alive, he would warn you to leave here, Miss Van Gorder.
Really?
Yes.
It's been a tragic place for anyone who ever lived in it.
Well, goodnight.
Goodnight, doctor.
Who's out there?
Nobody you need to worry about, doctor.
Oh, it's Andy.
That's right.
Good evening, Miss Van Gorder.
Good evening, Lieutenant.
Somebody sick here?
My maid was bitten by a bat.
Oh?
A rabid bat?
Well, I'll know for sure when I get to my lab.
I-- I caught the bat.
It happened indoors?
In my bedroom.
How'd it get in?
Well there are ways a bat could get in a house.
You ought to know.
I, uh, I spotted this hole in the window the minute
I got there.
That's where the two-legged bat got your door open.
Miss Van Gorder told me that she phoned headquarters at Zenith.
Yes, I phoned twice.
The second time was after the prowler got in the house.
Were you in headquarters, Andy?
No, but they contacted me.
An officer came and searched the house from top to bottom.
But they couldn't find the bat.
You better have this window fixed tomorrow.
Oh, yes, I certainly shall.
Yes, and I-- I better be going.
I'm due in surgery at 8 o'clock in the morning.
Goodnight.
Goodnight, doctor.
There will be a man patrolling the grounds all night,
Ms. Van Gorder.
Oh, thank you.
And nobody inside, Andy?
Why should there be?
Well, how do you know but what the bat is hiding somewhere in the house?
I'm quite sure he isn't in the house, doctor, not now.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Hi, Andy.
Hello, mark.
Well, congratulations, real estate business must be picking up-- new office, new furniture.
New deal, how do you like it?
It looks expensive.
Are you squandering your inheritance?
Oh, I haven't got it yet.
Well, the paper says John
Fleming left his entire fortune to you.
Funny thing about that entire fortune is that we can't find it.
No kidding?
No, all uncle John has in his bank account was a couple hundred dollars.
And his safe deposit box was empty.
If we don't find that missing million, mine will be empty too.
How come?
Well, all my savings were invested in Zenith bank stock.
The examiners won't certify the bank as solvent until those stolen securities are found.
So the stockholders have voted an assessment that'll wipe some of us out.
It's as is those securities have been converted into cash.
And if I can't find that cash, I'm sunk.
Well, where are you going to look for it, Andy?
Here in Zenith.
Your uncle wouldn't take a million on a hunting trip, would he?
You suspect uncle John?
Why, Andy, he founded the Zenith back.
That'd be like robbing the family tomb.
You think he wouldn't?
Well, besides, Vick
Bailey's fingerprints are all over the vault.
They didn't find any of uncle John's fingerprints.
Because he wiped them off.
Can the defense prove that.
They'll try to.
Judie Holland had Bailey's secretary as a defense witness.
And they believe her testimony will have a powerful effect on the jury.
Well, she has a powerful effect on me.
Judie's a doll.
Here's the book you mentioned, judie.
Your newest one.
Yes, it's just been published.
You can have that copy if you wish.
Oh, it's a first edition and you've signed it.
Yes, of course.
Thank you so much.
May I serve tea now, Ms. Van Gorder?
Yes, please do, Warner.
I see you've engaged new servants.
Yes, of course.
How did you persuade them to live in this house?
Jane Patterson, my new housekeeper, knows this house better than you do, doctor.
She worked for John Fleming.
And Warner was my chauffeur.
Chauffeur turned butler?
It's incredible.
He can play any part at a moment's notice.
Did you-- did you get a plumber, Warner?
Warner: No, we can't get a plumber for three days, madame.
What about that leaking pipe?
The basement will be flooded in three days.
The pipe is no longer leaking.
You mean it's dried up of its own accord?
Not quite, I packed the elbow where the water was coming up.
Packed the elbow?
Where did you learn how to do that?
Into each life, a little rain must fall.
And a careful man learns to keep himself dry.
Now, is there anything that you require, Miss Van Gorder?
No, not at the moment, Warner.
Thank you, madame.
Now, there's a character.
How long did you say that he worked for you as chauffeur?
About three months.
Dr. Wells: Well, I hope he doesn't have a police record.
My dear Dale, it may interest you to know that the last night of his life, John Fleming told me that he loved your husband like a son.
If Fleming were alive today, he would be fighting to prove Vick's innocence.
Could Mr. Fleming prove his own innocence?
Miss Van Gorder, can there be any doubt about it?
There will be when Ms. Holland testifies at Vick's trial.
Oh?
You know something that we haven't heard yet, judie?
Something I saw with my own eyes.
She's not permitted to say what it was.
My dear girl, I wouldn't think of asking her.
But let's assume for a moment that Fleming did steal the million.
Now, what would he do about it?
Where is it?
Hidden some place where he could lay his hands on it without getting caught in the act.
Now, if I was writing this instead of living in the middle of it, I'd hide it right here in this spooky old house.
Under a loose floorboard or up a chimney?
If Mr. Fleming had the nerve to steal a million, he'd make his plans well in advance.
I'd say he'd prepare a place to hide it, possibly when this house was being built.
I rented this place from mark Fleming, his nephew.
I wonder-- I wonder if he'd have the floor plans.
I'll ask him.
Yes.
Lizzie, will you bring
Mrs. Bailey the phone?
You ask him now.
His number is summit--
Summit-- 7537.
Thank you, Lizzie.
Summit?
Cordelia Van Gorder: 7537.
Not bad, hey, Andy?
That means new business.
Now, you see?
Somebody wants to buy a house.
Mark Fleming speaking.
Oh, hello, Dale.
Well, hang on a minute, honey, while I see if I have it.
It's Dale Bailey all excited.
Ms. Van Gorder wants to know if I have the floor plans of the Oaks.
Now, what would she want ith the floor plans?
Well, she suggested to me that your uncle might have hidden the bank loot there.
Are the plans here?
Somewhere in the house itself-- wait a minute.
There is a place where uncle Johnny might have kept those blueprints.
What place?
Well, I heard him talk about it a good many years ago.
I can't be sure of the exact location.
Anyway, I don't think the old boy had the guts to steal a million.
But if I find those plans,
I'll let you know, Andy.
Hello, Dale?
Look, honey, I haven't seen those plans since I was a kid.
But I'll come over tonight, and maybe we can find them.
Thank you, mark.
We'll expect you.
He seems to think they're here in the house somewhere.
He's coming over tonight.
Well, that's good.
Dale and judie are my house guests for the weekend.
Would you like to have dinner with us tonight?
Oh, no thank you, I couldn't.
I still have a few calls to make.
You know, if Judy's testimony is going to clear Vick Bailey and implicate John
Fleming, others may get the idea that there's buried treasure in this house.
Don't even mention your testimony until you're actually on the stand.
Oh, I won't.
That's a smart girl, judie, and a very lovely girl.
Well, good afternoon, ladies.
Doctor.
Goodbye, Dr. Wells.
Come on, girls, let's go.
Cordelia Van Gorder:
So many unusual things have happened here this summer.
The more I think about it, the more
I realize I should be putting them down on paper.
Weren't you your husband's secretary, Dale?
Yes, I was.
Do you take shorthand?
Mm-hm.
Well, my dear, if you'd like to have your mind occupied,
I want you to work with me while I write the story of this fantastic criminal, the Bat.
Wonderful dinner.
Thank you.
It was really nice.
It was a good dinner,
Lizzie, as usual.
Wonderful.
Oh, what a lovely piece of silver.
It's an original, isn't it?
Cordelia Van Gorder: Yes, the still use them in england.
That clock hasn't struck the hour in the last 10 years, if I'm to believe what mark Fleming told me.
Why is it angled away from the wall like that?
I don't know.
Somebody must have moved it.
Lizzie, very like, when she was dusting.
Wait a minute.
Did you know there's a door in this paneling?
No, I didn't.
Oh, by gracious!
So there is!
Maybe it opens to a secret passage.
Certainly to a secret something!
Who knows, girls, we may be about to stumble on that missing million.
There's a panel.
There must be some gimmick to it.
There always is.
Oh!
Officer: Calling car
11, calling car 11.
Proceed to the Oaks in
Zenith township immediately.
A homicide has been reported.
Ok.
Proceeding to the Oaks.
Notify the county coroner, Dr. Wells.
Tell him to come to the Oaks at once.
Horrible.
It's as if his throat had been torn by some creature with fans, or claws.
That's his sign.
We found it on the others he killed.
I had hoped those reports that he was up to his old tricks again were pure imagination.
But apparently they're based on fact.
He's come back, back to the scene of his kills.
Yes, that's who I mean.
That's who did this, the Bat.
Who found mark?
We all did.
That is Dale, and judie, and I,
Lizzie was in the dining room.
This is my new housekeeper,
Jane Patterson.
You know, she worked for John Fleming.
I know her.
Where were you, Mrs. Patterson?
In the kitchen cleaning up.
I cooked the dinner tonight.
Did you know that this secret closet was here?
No, it was behind the grandfather's clock.
Well, it was I who found it, really.
I noticed the clock had been moved.
And the door wasn't quite closed.
I'll get it.
Who is it?
Mark Fleming.
As coroner, you saw the same wounds on the others.
How long has he been dead?
Oh, I'd say about a half an hour.
Do you believe it was the Bat?
That's the Bat's trademark.
Perhaps he's still in the house.
It's possible.
Why should he be?
Because he's looking for something, and like you, he believes it's here.
And he's a persistent killer.
I would advise you get out of this house as quickly as possible, not withstanding our expert police protection.
Have you called the morgue?
They're on their way here.
Oh, good, I want to examine the body before they get here.
May we take it into another room?
Yes, to the sun room in the back.
Thank you, give me a hand.
Excuse me.
Oh, Warner, where have you been?
Well, madame it--
There's been an accident?
There's been a murder.
Mark Fleming, the young man from whom I leased this place, was killed here tonight.
They know who did it?
Well, they-- they believe it was the Bat.
I'm sorry I had to use the front door, Miss Van Gorder.
Bu I forgot my keys, and when
I rang the bell at the kitchen door, there was no response.
Oh, this is Warner, Lieutenant.
He's my butler.
He was my chauffeur.
Why'd you promote him?
Well, it's very difficult to find a butler.
They don't like service in the country.
Have you been a butler before?
I've served in many capacities, sir.
But this was my night off, and I forgot my keys.
I heard that part.
What time did you leave the house tonight?
Oh, about 6:30.
I had dinner at wiley's roadhouse.
Can you prove where you spent the rest of the evening?
I can try.
Try hard.
And don't leave the house.
I'll get to you later.
Very good, sir.
I shall be in my room, Miss
Van Gorder, if you need me.
Yes, Warner.
Surely, you don't think he's--
Warner and I have met before.
I can't recall where or when.
But I will.
There will be a crew here shortly from headquarters, dusting for fingerprints, taking photographs.
But in the meantime,
Mrs. Patterson, you aren't leaving the house tonight are you?
No, Lieutenant.
Don't, I'll talk to you in the morning.
Goodnight.
Goodnight, sir.
Goodnight.
Dale, I was with mark
Fleming this afternoon when you talked to him about the floor plans of this house.
I heard him tell you he was coming here tonight.
Dale called him at my request.
She told me he was coming.
Who else heard her tell you that?
Judie, Lizzie.
And that nice Dr. Wells.
Dr. Wells?
There are few killers who kill for the fun of it.
The Bat very likely is a mental case.
And I'm convinced that his crimes are by his person gain.
There's a million dollars at large.
And he's going to keep on hunting for it until he lays his hands on it.
Now, these young ladies are staying here tonight?
Yes, they're my house guests.
Well, when my crew arrives, we'll be busy for a while.
So I'd suggest that--
That we go to our rooms?
That's a very good idea.
Come on, girls.
What a police guard for this house tonight, Lieutenant?
You've got one.
I'm going to cover this place tonight from the attic to the basement.
If the Bat makes another call, I'll have a little surprise for him.
Who, uh-- who is he?
Have you any idea?
He could be anybody.
So far, there are clues to his identity, but nothing we could take before a jury.
I am afraid we must look higher than the criminal world.
He may be a merchant, lawyer, doctor, scientist, one of the pillars of his community.
Ladies, lock your doors tonight.
Stay behind them.
I promise you you'll be safe.
Goodnight.
Goodnight, Lieutenant.
Poor mark.
Yeah, it's a pity.
So young.
Well, doctor, do you agree it was the Bat?
In my report, I shall say the death was caused by the same technique used in the other killings, a paralyzing blow to the throat, followed by a severe lacerations of the jugular, resulting in excessive hemorrhage.
In a layman's language, he didn't know what hit him.
Oh, he knew, but he didn't have time to think about it.
You staying here tonight, Andy?
Well, until I check the doors and windows.
But I'll be back bright and early in the morning.
Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds.
A lot of people are due for a shock when I close this case.
Yes, I'm sure they are.
Goodnight, Andy, don't get hurt.
Goodnight, doctor.
You know, I think we'd better let get some sleep.
Oh, well Lizzie and
I share this room for mutual protection.
You know, one night, a storm blew the wires down, put the lights out.
And I went out the next day and bought a half a dozen of these things.
You better take one with you, Dale.
Oh, thank you.
We'll go across the hall.
Are you sure there's nothing else you need?
Quite sure, we'll be all right.
Well, if anything bothers you, you just sing out.
And two strong women will come to your rescue.
Oh, nothing will bother us, not with Andy on the job.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Don't worry, everything will be all right.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Come on, Lizzie.
I don't think
I'll sleep tonight.
Me neither.
All I can see is poor mark Fleming staring at us.
I thought that when people died their eyes closed, as in sleep.
Don't think about it.
I bet you're thinking about it.
No, I was thinking of my poor husband sleeping in jail tonight.
Oh, judie, I love him so much.
What's that noise?
Oh, I don't know.
I kind of fell half asleep.
For a moment, I thought it was something from a dream.
It's somewhere in the house.
Yes, on the floor above, not directly over us, probably a room overlooking the driveway.
Should we call Ms. Van Gorder?
She'll hear it.
How can she help but hear it?
Besides, we don't want her to think we're a couple of hysterical women.
I'm about to become one.
I've had it for one night.
Dale, you're not going out in that hall.
I want to know what's happening up there.
But Lieutenant
Anderson said if we stayed behind our locked doors, we'd be safe.
Vick isn't safe locked up in that jail.
Suppose that stolen money is in this house.
Mark Fleming seemed to think it was.
Maybe that's what somebody's looking for.
Oh, for heaven's sake, don't you hear that awful noise up there?
Now, Lizzie!
You've just got to stay awake!
The house phone and the outside phone wires have been cut!
And we can't get help!
Where's that policeman?
Oh, I don't know.
Something must have happened to him.
Now, go on.
Get on your robe.
Oh, Dale, please don't go up there.
I've got to.
Think what it could mean to Vick.
Now you stay here.
Oh no, if you go, I go.
You stay here.
No, no--
You wait here.
I'm going to see what it is.
Oh, please let me go with you.
Judie, will you warn me if anyone comes?
And I'll only be a moment.
Now, wait.
Oh no!
What did he do to her!
Judie!
No, not judie!
Give her to me.
I'll look after her.
Poor baby.
Judie.
The Bat.
Yes, the Bat.
He caught her at the head of the stairs.
We saw him rushing down the stairs as we came out of the room.
I hurled that after him.
I hit him, I believe.
I'm going to cover this place from attic to basement, you said!
Well, what were you covering when that poor child was murdered?
Where were you?
I saw a man outside on the grounds.
I went out there and hunted him.
I heard him in among the trees.
And so I followed the sound of him as far as the brook down near the back road.
And then I lost him.
Oh.
I'd rather give my own life than have this happen to Judy.
But I told you to stay in your rooms and lock your doors and stay there!
What was she doing at the head of those stairs?
That was my fault.
They heard a strange noise, heavy pounding in one of the rooms on the third floor.
We all heard it.
I wanted to see what it was.
Judie, she wouldn't let me go out by myself.
I made her stay on the balcony.
What about your new butler?
Well, he's in his room, I suppose.
Oh, Mrs. Patterson.
Yes?
Did you know what happened here?
No, sir, but I heard the screams.
I to call Warner.
We have rooms on the same floor.
But he wasn't in his room.
His bed hasn't been slept in.
If Mrs. Patterson heard the screams,
Warner could certainly hear them.
You're quite right, sir.
I heard them.
Oh, you did?
And where were you?
Outside on the grounds.
Ms. Holland has been murdered.
No.
So you're surprised, shocked.
Well, I've seen better performances.
I remember you now.
Your name's not Warner.
I've got a circular in my office with your picture on it.
The Chicago police not so long ago were hunting for you in connection with a robbery.
You're right again, sir.
And they found me, and they tried me.
And I proved my innocence.
And I was acquitted.
That could have been a lucky break.
Where were you when this child was killed?
I told you before, sir, outside.
What were you doing there?
I was following you.
I saw you leaving the house.
And it seemed that you were hunting someone.
I thought you might need some help.
Oh, yes, sir, I followed your flashlight down through the trees.
Then it disappeared.
And then suddenly as I was staring out into the darkness,
I was struck by something on to the back of the head.
Next thing I knew, I was lying on the ground.
I realized I'd been knocked out.
I wish you had been knocked out.
For then we'd have found you with your mask still on your face!
You were hit here in this house with this poker as you were rushing down those stairs after that child--
Oh, no, sir, you can't pin this on me.
I'm not the Bat!
I've never killed.
I couldn't kill.
I won't take the rap for this!
Well, doctor, we have another case for the county coroner.
You see, the Bat came back.
Why did you come back, doctor?
Well, I-- I had an accident about a mile down the road.
The right rear wheel of my car came off, and I plunged into the ditch.
This was the nearest house.
So I came here to call for help.
I thought I'd find you around, Andy.
Physician, heal thyself.
You're must have been hit by something on the back of your head.
I told you.
I had an accident.
So you did, doctor.
So you did.
I could be wrong.
But maybe I'm not.
We shall see.
Fine, dear, let's start a new chapter.
For days, the murders held the headlines.
Lieutenant Anderson grilled us, and ransacked the house from top to bottom.
Warner was not placed under arrest.
But his every move was watched.
At night, except for a detective on guard in the house, the police and the reporters left us alone.
And on one of those nights, without telling
Lizzie or anyone else, I pursued a secret investigation of my own.
It was in an empty room on the third floor where we kept our trunks and other things.
Put 'em up, Bat.
That's a bright idea to kill me in my own lab and let people think that I'm the Bat.
But you had to kill me first.
What was it to be, ambush?
Clever as you are, you're not smart enough to do that.
Nor were you smart enough to find the money, though you came quite close to it.
But I know where it is.
And when you're dead with that sign pinned on your chest,
I'm going to collect it and live happily ever after.
He destroyed himself, how true that will be.
Goodbye, Bat.
Here's a serum that will heal you whether you're rabid or not.
Something's wrong.
Something's wrong.
Miss Cornelia?
Miss Cornelia?
Now, where would she be going at this time of night?
I never!
Oh!
Mr. Davenport, Mr. Davenport--
Oh, a fine thing, the door unbolted, the chain off, and you asleep on the job.
Wait till Lieutenant
Anderson hears about this.
Come on!
Wake up!
What's the matter with you?
I don't know.
I don't know.
My head hurts, my whole body is numb.
Here, here, take a sip of this.
Try to snap out of it.
I'll be back in a minute.
Hurry, will you?
It's Lizzie.
I'm terribly worried.
I can't find Ms.
Cornelia anywhere.
And something's happened to the policeman.
I don't know what.
Get Warner.
Bring him to the drawing room.
Tell him we need him.
Are you all right now?
Yeah, I'll be all right in a minute.
I remember now.
I took a drink of wine from that decanter there.
Ms. Van Gorder told me to help myself.
She wouldn't put nothing in it.
Well, somebody did, somebody who knew I was on duty here.
And it was somebody that got Ms. Van Gorder.
I can't find her anywhere-- upstairs, downstairs, or in the basement.
I told the housekeeper to get Warner.
Lieutenant Anderson will want to know about this.
Hello?
Yeah, this is
Davenport at the Oaks.
We've got trouble here.
Well, for one thing
I was drugged.
Yeah.
But I must have been knocked out, because the maid tells me
Ms. Van Gorder's missing.
You better call Anderson and let him know.
He's not at home?
Well where is he?
Out on a case?
What case?
Dr. Wells?
What else did they tell you about him?
Oh, hurry, will you?
We've got to find Ms. Cornelia!
Ok.
Lieutenant Anderson is out on a case.
Dr. Wells was found dead in a room next to his garage, murdered.
Dr. Wells?
There's something queer about the killing of Wells.
But headquarters won't talk about it.
Lizzie, Warner isn't in his room.
There's no sign of him anywhere.
And I was supposed to keep an eye on that guy.
Where's Ms. Cornelia?
That's what I want to know!
Wait a minute!
Didn't you say that the chain and the bolt were off of the front door?
I certainly did.
Well, maybe Ms. Van
Gorder went outside.
Oh, she never would.
We better look.
I can't-- I can't breathe.
There's no air.
Ms. Cornelia?
Ms. Van Gorder?
Ms. Van Gorder?
Look!
There's a light in that room on the third floor.
Were you up there tonight?
Well, of course I was, but I turned the lights out before I came downstairs.
Ms. Cornelia might have turned them on again.
That's where we're going to look first.
Come on!
Cornelia?
Miss Cornelia?
Miss Cornelia?
Yes!
I'm here!
Right here!
Here we are, Ms. Van Gorder.
What do we do now?
Over the mantle, there are five panels.
Try to-- with your hands.
Which panel did you say, Ms. Van Gorder?
Oh, I-- I just--
Ms. Van Gorder!
Which panel!
We couldn't hear you!
She said strike it!
What difference does it make which panel?
Strike them all!
Look!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, it's all right now.
It's all right, dear.
Lizzie's here.
I'm feeling better?
Yes, much better.
We'll take you to your room.
Oh, no you want.
I'm going to stay right here.
I'm quite all right.
Oh, how blessed it is to breathe without an effort.
You know, no one knows how sweet the air can taste until someone shuts it off for a moment.
That room is just like a box.
When the mantle piece closed, it seemed like all the air was drawn out of it.
Look!
There it goes again!
Let it close.
I can open it from in here.
There's a control panel behind this blueprint, electric motor under the trap door here.
Once the door's open, you can keep it that way.
I believe that the fireplace in this other room opens the same way.
And it does.
I tried to find this.
But I couldn't find it.
Yeah, it was back of this blueprint here.
Well, it's-- it's quite a set up.
Too bad we can't open that safe the same way.
Take an expert to crack this box, or a shot of nitro.
Maybe-- maybe that's what the Bat had in mind.
Could be, seems he's on the prowl tonight.
Ms. Van Gorder,
Warner has disappeared.
Really?
And Dr. Wells has been murdered.
Dr. Wells?
Lieutenant Anderson's on that case right now.
Well, does he know what happened here tonight?
They got word to him.
He'll be here any minute.
What's that noise?
Ms. Van Gorder, the garage is on fire.
Great scot!
Look at that!
Lizzie, put that light out in the other room.
Now, where are you going?
To report the fire.
Well, you just stay right here.
But Ms. Van Gorder, the garage.
Let it burn.
You watch the stairs.
Can't you see that fire was set to get us out of the house.
Out of the-- well, you're talking about the--
Yes, yes, I'm talking about the Bat.
Now that the lights are out, he'll think his trick has worked, and we've gone.
He'll be here any minute.
Well, so will
Lieutenant Anderson.
I hope so.
But the Bat will be here first.
And he'll kill again if we're in his way.
We've got to be as clever as he is.
But you'll be safer downstairs.
I'll take care of him.
Well, the others can go.
But I'm going to stay right here.
All right, but get out of sight.
Let's face it, ladies, and get it over with.
Others have seen my face before they died.
But I'll have to deny you that pleasure.
This would make a good scene for your book, Ms. Van Gorder.
But I'm afraid you'll never write it.
That is Warner.
I could tell.
You misjudge me, Ms. Ellen.
Warner!
I don't like being a murder suspect, Ms. Van Gorder.
I was headed for a plane.
But halfway to the airport, I changed my mind and came back.
I'm glad that I did.
Why, it's Lieutenant Anderson!
Yes, it was Anderson.
He had discovered the secret of the hidden room and was waiting to get into it and open up the safe.
We found the money in it, little over a million in tens, and twenties, and hundreds.
Good old Andy, with all his ill-gotten gains invested in bank stock.
It's rather a clever way to hide stolen money-- in the open, as it were, and so respectable.
But don't try it.
No matter how clever you are, you can't hide murder.
Well, that's it, Dale.
That's the end.
Let's get a move on, Tom.
We can get this sort of thing on postcards.
Let's shoot something worth taking home.
Hey, what's your hurry?
We've got the rest of the day, haven't we?
Not if we want to take pictures, we haven't.
We'll lose the...
Hey, hey, would that be worth taking home?
She must've read your thoughts.
Tom, what about this for Julia?
I'll choose my own presents.
I just asked your opinion.
I'm buying it.
You know, you two guys slay me.
Julia this, Julia that.
Wouldn't you both be better off with a girl apiece, right here, rather than half a girl in New York?
But what a half!
How's that for a picture?
Hi there. We're just gonna take a picture.
Yeah. How about a repeat?
Not so soon.
He doesn't like it.
Do those cobras ever bite any of you guys?
Yes, it often happens.
Is it a painful death?
Slow and horrible.
Pretty risky business, playing flute for a snake.
It was my father's trade and his father's.
The cobra has a fascination.
It's like looking death in the face.
Let's see the snake.
How about a picture of you holding him?
I would do it for $2.
Give him the money, will you?
Okay. Here you are.
Nick, it looks just like you.
Well, why not?
My uncle Pudgy was always known as the black snake of the family.
I come from a long line of snakes in the grass.
Hey, have you guys ever heard of snakes being changed into people?
No, but I heard vice versa.
It's not so funny. You remember Dr. Sindar.
Yeah.
He told me a weird story once about a secret society that worships snakes.
What did he call them? Lamians.
What's so weird about that?
They insisted the Lamians believe that men and women could be changed into snakes and back again.
They do?
Must've been powerful medicine you and the doctor were drinking that night.
Hey, now, that'd be a picture worth taking home, man into snake.
What about snake into woman?
Wonder what they do for an encore.
Sure, it's funny. Unless it's true.
And if it is, I'd give anything to see it.
Anything, Sergeant?
If the Sergeant means what he says about giving anything, he might find the chance he's looking for.
Because what you have heard is true.
You mean this can really happen?
For us? Yes. For you? Who knows.
Ah, he's nuts.
Have you ever seen this?
I am a Lamian, a member of the cult of the cobra.
Nick, maybe he's your uncle Pudgy's long-lost cousin.
Knock it off, you guys.
Go ahead, tell us about it.
I have a great need of money.
And for a great need, an old man will take a great risk.
Get to the point.
This very night there is a meeting.
For $100 of your money, I will show you she who is a snake and yet a woman.
Now you know he's nuts. And 100 bucks?
Do we look that crazy?
Wait a minute. What if he's on the level?
No outsiders have ever seen this ritual.
I'll bet no one else ever has either.
The secret meeting is at 9:00.
I will get you past the temple guards at great risk to myself.
We'd be the first outsiders, huh?
Listen, you knuckleheads,
I think this really might be worth seeing.
That's over 15 bucks apiece.
Yeah, but what a snapshot.
Snake into woman.
No pictures. It is dangerous enough.
Yeah, he's right.
8:00 tonight at the Café Bristol.
And $10 now, please.
How do we know you'll be there?
You do not know.
Another risk.
How about it, huh?
It's okay with me.
Give him the $10.
At least give us your name for the 10 bucks.
I am Daru.
Daru, I'm the banker.
Remember, no cameras.
You said that before.
The Café Bristol.
8:00, gentlemen.
Come on, let's go.
We'll see you there.
Hey, you want another?
Me, too.
No, no. You've had enough.
You want to be able to see what's gonna happen tonight, don't you?
My last pass.
You don't really believe that old guy's nonsense, do you?
Well, I don't know whether
I believe him or not, but if I didn't think it were possible,
I wouldn't be so anxious to go.
Professor, what do you got up your sleeve?
Well, it isn't just the cult of the cobra.
You know, for thousands of years, people have believed in metamorphosis.
Met her where?
Did you get her address?
All right. You can laugh if you want to.
But the changing of a man into an animal is part of the folklore of many countries.
Hey, maybe the professor can change that monkey into a beautiful blonde.
That's a great idea.
All right. Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
What about the Chinese Corporal who swears he saw a tiger change into a man?
Too much rice wine.
All right. Then the werewolf stories in Germany?
Or the vampires in Transylvania?
Hey, Paul, how come you know so much about all this?
He comes from a long line of bats.
Hey, here's old faithful.
Okay, guys.
Well, here goes nothing.
Yeah, 100 bucks' worth.
The ceremony you are about to see recreates the first time the cobra goddess came to the aid of the Lamian people.
Remember all I have told you.
Again, I caution you, you must not be discovered.
Yeah, but if they do discover us, what'll they try to do? Kill us?
The word "try" is unnecessary.
They will kill you.
They'll have to catch me first.
They will do so.
For hundreds of years, there have been those in every generation who have the power to change from humans into snakes.
These are used as the instruments of the cuIt's vengeance.
Either this guy is crazy and I don't like it, or he's telling the truth and I like it less.
I'm glad we're going back to the States.
It is not too late to change your minds.
No, I'll go along.
Don't forget the password.
Where's Nick?
Stop him.
Rico, grab him.
Yeah.
The cobra goddess will avenge herself!
One by one you will die!
Let's get out of here!
Fools! They'll kill you.
They'll follow you to...
Come on, let's go!
Come on, Carl!
Hurry up!
Go.
Step on it, Tom.
Boy, that was close.
Hey, where's Nick?
He had a head start on us.
Let's go back and get him.
We can't leave him.
What's that?
Nick.
Wake up, Nick.
How is he?
He's still alive.
Hey, what's that?
It looks like a snakebite.
Who's got a knife?
Here.
Get him in the jeep.
We gotta get him to the hospital fast.
Let's get out of here.
What I don't understand is why you picked up that basket.
I wanted it as a souvenir.
With the cobra?
I didn't want the snake, I wanted the woman.
Oh, brother, were you gone!
I must've been off my rocker.
I grabbed that basket, started running, kept going till I blacked out.
We did some running ourselves.
We sure did.
I'm sorry, fellas. Thanks.
You're still shipping out with us tomorrow.
They tell me. I got a bunk, pretty nurse and all the trimmings while you ride in the bucket seats.
Pretty rough.
Doc tells me you saved my life.
We'll split a Purple Heart.
Those guys at the temple sure blew their tops.
Well, they got a right to be sore.
Let's just hope this is the end of it.
Paul figures we're all gonna get it in our sleep.
I must've been real drunk.
Well, you're all right now, and that's what counts.
Getting plenty of rest is another thing that counts.
Sorry, boys. You'll have to leave him now.
All right, ma'am.
Don't let him give you any trouble, now.
We'll check with you in the morning.
See you later, Nick.
Thanks for coming over.
Good night, Nick.
So long.
How am I doing?
By tomorrow morning you can get up and pitch in on KP duty.
Uh-uh. Thanks anyway, Lieutenant, but I'm leaving tomorrow.
Going home.
Yes, I know.
Good night, Corporal.
Good night, ma'am.
I don't understand, sir.
You said yourself that Corporal Hommel was well enough to ship out with us today.
Medicine isn't foolproof, Sergeant.
There are no guarantees.
But last night Nick was alive and well.
I'm sorry, Sergeant.
But how?
Neurotoxic venom affecting the nerves caused a paralysis of the heart.
But you said the poison had been neutralized.
Take it easy, Paul.
You're just going over the same ground.
You're scheduled to take off in five minutes.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir. Goodbye, Captain.
I'm sorry, Sergeant.
Goodbye and good luck.
Goodbye, Sergeant.
That whole gang was very close.
Steve, I'm just as upset as he is, and you might as well know why.
Last night the boy's temperature was down, the infection was under control.
Most of the venom was drawn out of that kid before he was brought in, and we took it from there.
And this morning at 6:30 he was dead.
How do you figure it?
When I examined the body this morning it was loaded with venom. Cobra venom.
The patient had been reinfected.
Understand?
You mean he was bitten again?
Yes, and that's what's been driving me crazy.
Only a snake with a brain could've got into that room last night and singled out that same kid.
It's almost as if...
Well, it's absurd, but...
As if he were meant to go that way.
Listen, you guys, when even the doctors can't explain Nick's death, it figures.
First, the high priest puts a curse on all of us.
Then, right away, the next night,
Nick is bitten by a cobra.
Look, Paul, we're going home.
After four years, we're going home.
So can the misery, will you?
I second that.
Think of something pleasant. Think of Julia.
Hey, I'll make book.
When we reach New York who will Julia kiss first, Tom or Paul?
I'll take Tom.
RlCO: How much?
Knock it off, will you, Rico?
Can't a guy make a living?
You know, that's what worries me.
After I go through my separation pay, how am I gonna live?
Air force doesn't look so bad now, now that you're gonna be a civilian, eh?
I'm not worried.
Tom will be a big wheel, have an office on Fifth Avenue.
He'll give us all jobs.
Yeah, well, not me, because I'm all set.
Last letter from the old man, he wants me to take over his bowling alley.
You can look for the big red neon sign in Charles Street in the Village,
Rico's Bowling Alley.
You mean we can all bowl for free?
Any time you're broke, buddy.
Look out, Rico.
You're giving him a lifetime pass.
Mr. and Mrs. Paul Able.
Oh, Paul, it sounds so wonderful.
I know I like it.
And in a couple of weeks it'll be permanent.
Well, let's beard the lion in his den.
I dread telling Tom.
Let me do it.
No, honey, it's up to me.
It's the only decent way.
Hey, not bad.
Hi.
Hi, Tom.
I'm thirsty. How about buying me a drink?
Sure. I'll buy more than a drink.
How about dinner tomorrow?
Hello, Paul.
Hi, Rico. How's business?
Not bad, considering.
Tom, I've made up my mind.
Oh?
I'm going to marry Paul.
I'm sorry.
I couldn't really make up my mind until I saw you both again.
Now that I have, l...
It's just so right with Paul.
I'm so happy with him.
Will you keep on working?
Yes.
I'm in the show.
We open in Philadelphia, couple of days.
Yeah, you'll have to work.
Paul will be a research assistant all his life,
60 bucks a week.
Tom, don't. Paul and I both love you and want you to stay our friend.
Sure. I'm sorry.
I don't expect you not to be angry and hurt.
Well... Congratulations.
We'd better get back, or your husband will get jealous.
Hey, Rico,
Paul and Julia are gonna get hitched.
Well, great.
Congratulations, Paul.
Yeah, thanks, Rico. Thanks.
Well, congratulations, old man.
Thanks, Tom.
Guess I better start looking for a new roommate, huh?
Well, I wouldn't trade you for anybody but Julia.
You won't have to until I get back.
How long are you gonna be gone?
Two weeks.
It's the out of town tryout, and it's quite a break for me.
Besides, we need the money.
Yeah.
I've got a few bucks if you ever run short.
You know we feel the same way, Tom.
There isn't anything we wouldn't do for you.
Okay, roommate, I'll see you later.
No, tomorrow.
Tonight I have to take Julia and a couple of the kids to Philadelphia.
Then I've got some work at the museum in the morning.
How about dinner tomorrow night, huh?
Sure, fine.
Tom, I'm sorry things didn't work out the way you wanted.
I can take care of myself.
I suppose it's none of my business, but...
No. Not anymore.
You sound like I feel.
What gives you the willies tonight?
I'll make us some hot milk, then maybe we both can get some sleep.
Are you all right? I heard your screams.
A man. He tore at me. I couldn't see him.
Maybe he got out through the patio.
There's no one out there.
Looks like he made a clean getaway.
What are you doing?
He may still be in the neighborhood.
I'll call the police.
No, don't. I don't want any fuss. Please.
It's the only sensible thing to do.
I don't want it.
Well, all right, whatever you wish.
Good night, then.
I'm sure everything's all right.
I'm right across the hall in case you need me.
Please, don't go.
Let me fix you a cup of coffee.
No, thanks. I'll take a cigarette.
I'm sorry. I haven't any.
Here, here, take it easy.
Nothing to be afraid of now.
You have no idea how frightening it is to wake up and...
It's all over now.
It was horrible.
I just moved in today.
Tomorrow I'll have to look for a new place.
You shouldn't have to.
This is usually a very quiet neighborhood.
I wouldn't know.
I've only been in New York a week.
Well, I admit, you didn't get the best introduction to our city.
It's a strange city.
It so big and so cold and so unfriendly.
Well, I'm friendly.
Yes, I know.
And I'm very grateful.
I'm not frightened now.
You can go if you want to.
I've got an idea.
Let me show you New York tomorrow.
You'll forget all this.
You'll see, it'll do you good.
No, I don't think so.
Why not?
Have you got something else to do?
No. It's very nice of you, but I'll be all right.
It's not nice of me. I'd like to.
You are very kind, but we're strangers.
After tomorrow we won't be.
Oh, come on, let's make it tomorrow.
Or should I say in about six hours?
Don't you have to go to work?
Yes. I have a job as an artist.
An artist? I should've guessed.
You have very gentle hands.
I'm not that much of an artist.
It's commercial art, advertising.
My time is my own, usually.
Unfortunately, so is mine.
Well, then, that makes it easy.
How about tomorrow?
All right. It might be fun.
Good. I'll see you at 10:00.
And don't forget, I'm right across the hall in case you need me.
That's very reassuring.
I feel much better now.
Good night, Mr. Markel.
Call me Tom.
How'd you know my last name?
Well, it's on the mailbox.
And you're?
My name is Lisa Moya.
Good night, Lisa. Don't forget, 10:00.
Yes.
Your hot dogs, mister.
Mustard?
Yeah.
Ever have one of these before?
No, I haven't.
Just right. Thank you.
Those will be right up, mister.
You know, you look even better in the daytime.
You said that before.
Yeah, well, let's see now.
We've been on the Staten lsland Ferry, we've climbed the Statue of Liberty.
I've shown you Wall Street, the Fulton Fish Market.
How do you like it so far?
It's fabulous.
I don't think a hot dog stand suits you.
No, you'd look better over cocktails.
Well, that'll come later.
We've got to take a ride on the subway, and we've got to go up the Empire State Building.
Sure you're not tired?
No.
Well, drink up. We got a lot to do.
You lead the way.
You cannot lose me now.
It was a lovely day.
And you're right about the city.
I liked it very much.
It loved you.
I'm glad you moved in across the hall.
So am l.
Does that mean that you not only like
New York, but I'm okay, too?
Yes. You're okay, too.
Prove it.
I can't figure you out.
It's getting late, Tom.
Before you go in,
I'd like you to meet my roommate, Paul Able.
All right. Just for a minute.
Paul's engaged.
I'd still like to meet him.
Hey, I thought we were gonna have dinner...
I got a better offer.
This is Paul Able. Lisa Moya.
How do you do?
Hello.
She just moved in across the hall.
Well, that's a break.
Funny. He certainly has been acting strange lately.
I wonder what's bothering him.
A dog? What kind of a dog?
Just a dog.
He's usually very friendly.
Would you like a drink?
I don't drink.
Tom, how about you?
Yeah, thanks.
Well, I see you, and I see Paul.
Who are the others?
Well, that's Nick.
He was killed just before we came home.
Oh.
That's Rico. He runs Rico's Bowling Alley.
I'll have to take you there sometime.
I don't bowl.
I know. Or drink, or smoke.
And from the sample,
I'm not sure you even kiss.
I think you're making fun of me now.
I don't mean to.
Who's this one?
That's Carl. He's a lady's man.
Like you?
Even more so.
And that's Pete.
Here's your drink, Tom.
Oh, thanks.
What about Pete?
Oh, he's just a nice guy.
That's Julia.
She and Paul are going to be married.
She's very pretty. Where is she?
She's in Philadelphia.
She's opening in a new play.
You ought to meet her when she gets back.
Well, if you two will excuse me, I have to hit the hay. Got a big day tomorrow.
I'll be along in a minute, Professor.
Very nice meeting you, Lisa.
Good night, Paul.
It's late. I think I'd better go, too.
Sure.
Well, what'd you think of Paul?
I think he's very nice.
So are you.
When will I see you?
What about tomorrow night?
I'm sorry. I have an appointment tomorrow night.
The next night?
What about Sunday? Carl is having a party.
All right. Sunday night.
Good.
Good night.
Good night. See you Sunday.
I just wanted to make sure you're all right.
No mysterious strangers?
No unwanted guests?
Everything is fine.
Are you sure you don't want me to look around?
I'm sure.
Good night.
Good night.
Well, what'd you think?
I'd say you're doing fine.
Looks like you found something there.
I never cottoned to a girl so fast in my life.
Or do you think it's a rebound?
You'll have to answer that.
She's a lot of fun.
Strange, though.
Not like the usual girl.
Thank you.
Pete's coming over now for a nightcap.
How about joining us?
No, thanks, but I gotta close up.
Okay. Be at my place Sunday night, 9:00.
You bet.
Do Paul and Tom know?
Yeah.
You want me to bring anything?
Just a case of beer or two or three.
I'll bring a case of beer.
I'll put it in my car tonight so I don't forget.
Okay. Good night, Rico.
Good night, fellas.
Good night, Rico.
I'm sorry to come back so late, Mr. Nardi, but I saw your light still on.
Well, you really scared me.
There's no reason to be scared, Mr. Nardi.
When I came earlier you were out.
Do you think you could spare a little donation again, same as always?
Sure, Mrs. Weber. Glad to do it.
Thank you very much.
Good night.
Good night.
You know, it just doesn't make sense.
A guy goes through the whole war without a scratch and then ends up like this.
At least it was quick.
First Nick then Rico.
If I believed all those things we saw in that Lamian temple, I think...
You know, I can still hear that old snake charmer screaming.
What's his name?
Daru?
Yes.
"One by one," he said.
Snap out of it.
You're talking nonsense.
I guess I'll call the party off Sunday night.
No. I wouldn't do that.
I think it might do us good to see each other.
That's right.
It's okay with me.
See you Sunday night.
Okay, Carl.
So long.
Bye, Carl.
Whoa, whoa! What's the trouble, fella?
What's the trouble here?
You must have had some premonition about that.
You knew that horse was gonna rear, didn't you?
I've always been afraid of horses.
That particular horse was afraid of you.
Well, this is where I leave you.
I've got to work late tonight, so don't wait up.
I may be a little late myself.
Thanks, Pete.
Real nice party, huh?
I'm glad Carl got us together.
This is the first time I've felt relaxed since...
Yeah, yeah, it helped me forget.
It looks as if Carl were trying to help himself, mostly.
She's a beautiful girl.
Reminds me of someone.
That's odd.
I've got the same feeling.
I... Hey, what's the matter with you?
Let's get some air, Lisa.
Why couldn't you have moved in next door to me?
Tom gets all the breaks.
You have many pictures of very beautiful girls.
They don't compare to you, honey.
Oh, really?
Tom, what do you think you're doing?
Lisa, get your coat.
We're leaving.
I don't get it. What did I do?
Lisa, are you ready?
Take it easy, Tom.
It isn't worth it.
It's worth it to me.
Come on, Lisa, let's go.
What's gotten into him?
I don't know. I've never seen him act like this before.
I'm sure she's no good for him.
Come on, Carl.
Bridge Hotel. That's on Ninth.
You look wonderful.
I feel wonderful, excited and happy.
What about you?
What's all this about Tom?
Well, it's about his new girl, Lisa.
I want you to talk to him about her.
Me? Oh, no.
You're the only one who can talk any sense into him.
That's ridiculous.
He'll tell me it's none of my business.
But it is.
There's something about her.
Something I can't explain.
I'm afraid of her.
It has to do with Rico's death.
But that was an accident.
I'm not so sure.
Oh?
Why do you say that?
Well, it started overseas.
It was our last pass, and we spent it like a bunch of tourists.
We got mixed up with a snake cultist who got us into a religious meeting.
A cult that believed human beings could be changed into snakes.
That's a religion?
They're as serious about it as we are about ours.
You don't believe it, do you?
But they do.
What we saw there was pretty ugly.
It ended in the snake cultist's death and Nick's being bitten by a cobra.
The next night he was dead.
The priest put a curse on all of us.
One by one, he said, we'd die.
That's frightening.
And you think Tom's girl has something to do with this?
That's the whole point. I do.
Paul, you used to be sensible.
This is so incredible.
Julia, meet her. Meet this girl.
And I feel certain that you'll sense something.
Something strange.
It was a nice evening, Tom. Thank you.
Let's not end it.
Won't you come in for just a moment?
I'd like to talk to you.
All right.
I'll fix you a drink.
I don't drink, thank you.
Not for me.
Oh, yes, I remember.
Well, I need one.
What's the matter?
Don't you like her?
Here. Eat your troubles away, huh?
Paul forgot to fill the trays.
There's no ice.
Get some from my apartment.
Never mind.
No, go ahead.
You said you needed it.
All right, thanks.
I'll just be a second.
Well, that didn't take long.
This girl, Julia, were you once in love with her?
Yes, I was once.
Why did you change?
Is it because she's gonna marry Paul or because you met me?
No, it just happened.
How can you be sure you're not still in love with her?
Because I'm sure of how I feel about you.
How do you feel?
You don't have to drag it out of me.
I love you.
What I'm asking is, how do you know?
How can you be sure?
There's no real way of answering that.
Just something you feel inside.
Inside?
Yes.
What you mean is, you have to feel it from your heart and not from your head?
Is that right?
That is so right.
I have to go now.
Can't you stay a little while?
No, Tom.
Feeling better, now, Corky, huh?
Lisa?
Lisa?
Lisa, you forgot your gloves.
Are you decent?
Lisa.
Okay, good night.
See you later.
I'm taking Marian home. Be right back.
Good night, Marian.
Good night, Carl.
I had a wonderful time.
Well.
I had a wonderful time, Pete.
I'm sure you did.
Carl always said you're a million laughs.
Well, hi. Come on in.
I know it's late, but I wanted to apologize for spoiling your party.
But you didn't.
You couldn't spoil anything, honey.
Hey, come on in.
You know, Tom's a fool.
Course, I can't blame him for getting stuck on you.
Now tell me, why did you come back, really?
To see you.
Hey, that's swell.
Here, sit down.
Could I get you something?
A drink maybe?
Don't bother.
It's no bother.
All right.
I'll be right back.
Tom's okay. I guess he's a little stuffy, but I think it's from living with Paul so long.
Soda?
I've got a different attitude.
A beautiful girl, and...
Lisa?
Lisa?
What happened?
Some guy just jumped.
Carl.
It's Carl. He's dead. Don't look.
It's horrible. Let's go.
Anyone here know this man?
Yeah, I do.
I was his roommate.
Yeah?
You better come with us.
Oh, hi.
Where have you been?
Gosh, it's past 3:00.
I went for a walk.
My head ached, and I couldn't sleep.
I thought the air might make me feel better.
And did it?
You do look a little pale.
What are you doing in my apartment?
I brought back your gloves.
You couldn't have been gone more than a couple of minutes.
I went right out.
I wanted to think.
You've been walking all this time?
Now, look, don't do it again.
Let me know if you're going out.
Don't worry me like this.
I'm sorry I worried you.
What were you thinking about all this time?
Of you and of me.
How'd you make out?
I didn't come to any conclusions.
I'm so confused.
The feeling I have is so strange to me.
What do you mean?
I don't know how to tell you.
Well, try.
Do you know what it's like to believe in something all your life and then one day to suddenly decide that maybe it's wrong?
No, it's never happened to me.
What is this that you believe in?
Look, I don't care about this unless you want to tell me.
Tom, it's so easy for you.
You know how you feel.
Don't you? You've been in love before.
You'll have to forget about me.
You're being silly.
There are things I have to do.
What things?
Things I have no control over.
Look, if you're in trouble, tell me.
Let me help you.
What are these things that you believe in?
Tom, it's so difficult for me.
I can't stand the thought that I may be the one to hurt you.
Of course you wouldn't hurt me.
What I'm trying to say to you is
I love you.
Please, don't. Not now.
But I don't understand. You just said...
I know, but...
Look, this doesn't make any sense.
I've said all I can say.
But if you love me and I do love you, then what's the problem?
Oh, Tom, if it could only be so simple.
Wait a minute, this doesn't...
I don't like games.
I want to know what this is all about, right now.
No, I've said everything that I can say.
Now, please go.
All right.
Good night.
You're angry.
Yes.
And you're not going to take me to Julia's opening tomorrow night?
Well, I'm not that angry.
Maybe by then you'll have straightened it out.
Good night.
Okay, Tom. Come and get it.
You sure must've come in late last night.
Yeah.
Sorry I blew my top at the party.
Forget it.
How's Lisa?
Lisa's fine, thanks.
That must be Julia.
We're going down for our marriage license today.
Hello, darling.
How's my actress, hmm?
A little nervous.
Hi, baby. Want an egg?
No, just coffee. Thanks.
There you are.
How are you, Tom?
Fine, thanks. Welcome back.
How's the show?
You'll find out tonight.
You are coming to the opening, aren't you?
Wouldn't miss it.
Don't forget you're all supposed to meet in my dressing room before the show.
Try and make it about 7:45.
Sure we won't make you nervous?
I'm counting on you all to be so gay
I won't have time to be nervous.
You're bringing your girl?
Mmm-hmm.
I'm anxious to meet her.
Paul's told me a lot about her.
He has?
I'll get it.
Excuse me.
Hello. This is Paul Able.
Yes, lnspector.
Yes, I know Carl Turner.
He's a friend of mine.
Mr. Markel? Yes, he's here.
Both of us? But why?
What?
Yes, we'll... We'll be right down.
That was the police.
Carl is dead.
Paul, what about you and Tom?
What about us?
Well, if what Paul believes is true about the curse...
Oh, for the love of Pete.
Well, what did you find out?
We checked the blood type. It doesn't fit the deceased or Norton's.
Send Norton in.
Yes, sir.
Able and Markel are on their way over.
I'll send them in to you for a blood test the first thing.
Yes, sir.
Come in. Sit down.
This girl, this Miss Marian Sheehan backs your story.
Says you and she were the last to see Turner alive.
She says he was in good spirits.
That's right.
I asked you about this China statue in the apartment.
Yeah.
You sure you don't remember when it was broken?
I told you, I don't know whether it was or it wasn't broken when I left.
All right. That's all for now.
You can go.
Good morning.
Oh, good morning.
You must be Julia. I recognize you from your picture.
And you're Lisa.
That's right.
Where are Tom and Paul? They generally have me in for coffee in the morning.
They're at the police station.
Something awful happened.
Carl is dead.
Oh, that's terrible.
It's so sudden. I'm just stunned.
That's a shame.
How did it happen?
I don't know. I haven't heard any of the details.
What are you reading?
JULlA: Horrible, isn't it?
It's a cobra.
This whole book is about cobras and the worship of cobras.
Is that what Paul is interested in?
Just lately.
He has a strange idea.
It all started with an experience he had while he was in Asia.
Did Tom ever talk to you about it?
No.
Paul believes that there are people who can turn into snakes.
Did you ever hear of such a thing?
Paul feels that that's why Rico and Nick are dead, and probably Carl.
But those were accidents.
Paul doesn't believe it.
Doesn't he?
I've got the shirts.
That'll be $3.50.
Just a minute.
Okay. Thanks a lot.
I have to leave.
I'll call Paul later.
I still don't understand why you knocked
Carl Turner down.
I don't understand myself.
I was mixed up, and I'd been drinking.
You ever knock him down before?
No.
You ever been mixed up and drunk before?
Sure, I guess.
All right, what's the real reason?
What did you have against him?
I told you, I don't know.
He was dancing with my girl.
How long have you known this girl?
A few days.
When you left Carl Turner, was he in good spirits?
Sure he was.
Was he drunk?
No, not when we left.
Well, have you got any explanation as to why he should fall off that terrace?
Yes, but it's a curious one.
A curious one, huh?
Well, we'll get to it.
You both say you recall seeing this China statue in Carl's apartment.
Do either of you remember if it was broken before you left?
No.
All right, gentlemen, you can both go.
I got nothing to hold you on.
What about that curious explanation?
If you'll excuse me, I have some work to do.
Well, when we were in the Air Force, we had an experience at the place we were stationed.
We sneaked into a religious ceremony where they worship snakes, cobras.
Paul, not again.
What's that got to do with Turner's death?
Well, we were discovered there and the high priest put a curse on us, said we'd all die, one by one.
There were six of us.
Nick died the next night, then Rico was killed in a car wreck and now Carl.
You think this curse is killing you all, eh?
No, but someone acting as the agent of the curse.
Got any ideas?
Yes. Lisa Moya.
You're crazy.
Now, Tom, listen to me, please.
This is tough to say, but it's been on my mind.
It's been bothering me.
How can you bring Lisa into this?
What on earth have you got to go on?
Just a hunch, the flimsiest kind of circumstantial evidence.
She moved into the apartment next door, and then all these things began happening.
You can't convict someone because she happens to move into an apartment!
I know I can't, but I also can't help the way I feel!
You've got to do better than that.
Oh, you bet you do.
Look, lnspector,
I know this sounds ridiculous, but give me a minute, will you, and let me tell you the whole story?
Come in, Tom. The door's open.
Oh, hello.
Are you looking for Tom?
He's in the other apartment.
No, I'm looking for you.
Tom and I are going to leave in a few minutes.
Aren't you going to the play?
What are you doing? Stop it.
I know how you got that.
No, you don't.
I do.
From a little statue in Carl's apartment.
You must be insane.
No. No, I finally figured it all out.
I remember the night Nick was killed.
We were driving in the jeep when we saw
Nick in the shadows.
There was a girl standing over him.
And I remember how you met me outside the apartment the night Carl was killed.
What are you saying?
That you killed them and would have killed us all.
But why?
Why should you think I'd do a thing like that? Why should l?
If you were a Lamian...
I don't know what you're talking about.
Oh, yes, you do.
Go away, please.
So you can kill me, too?
No, please.
Now that I'm sure, now that I've seen that cut on your arm, will you let the police do a blood test?
Of course I will.
When Carl fell and the crowd ran over to him,
I was standing by a fence with spikes.
I was pushed against it. You can see.
Don't you believe me?
No, I don't.
I'm going to call the police.
No, Pete.
If I can prove that it wasn't l...
But you can't.
I can, I swear it. I can show you where I was when you were in service.
I have a passport with a date in it.
Yeah, but what about Rico?
You know that was an accident.
Where's the passport?
In my bedroom.
No.
The windows are barred.
I can't possibly get out.
Please let me prove my story to you.
Then prove it.
Tom.
Well, you look wonderful.
Thank you.
Darling, Julia told me about Carl.
I'm sorry. I think it's terrible.
You saw Julia?
For a few minutes this morning.
She told me that you had to go to the police station.
Why did the police want to see you?
Well, I knocked Carl down last night, if you remember.
Well, I remember, but surely they don't think that...
They don't know what to think.
Didn't Paul explain?
Paul's explanation was worse.
Tom, what is Paul's explanation?
It's a long story. Let's skip it, huh?
Look, I have a feeling like you're avoiding something. Why?
No. I just don't want to talk about it.
I can guess from Paul's attitude toward me at the party.
It's about me, isn't it?
All right, it's about you.
Paul feels I'm responsible in some way.
But how could he?
I don't know.
How about you?
Do you think that I could've...
I don't know what to think.
It'd be so much easier if you'd be honest with me.
Look, I think all this is very unfair.
If I could talk to Paul,
I know I could explain it to him.
You'll have a chance to talk to Paul later at the theater.
I don't really care about Paul.
What I care about is you.
What do you want to know?
Well, just before we got out of the Air Force...
It's such nonsense that...
And yet, I went through a war with five guys.
In the space of a few short weeks three of them are dead.
Actually, I'm upset, and I'm a little frightened.
Of me?
Of course not.
Tom, nothing can happen to you.
It just can't.
I hope you're right.
What I wanted to say is, if anything did happen to you, I'd die.
Let's forget it, huh?
I want to.
Please believe in me.
I believe in you.
Well, can't you show me better than that?
Better?
Much.
I never would've believed it.
We did what you suggested.
Here's the autopsy report on Turner and Nardi.
The coroner says, "Death from asphyxiation due to snake venom."
Venom from a large cobra.
Now will you believe me?
I can't buy your story about metamorphosis.
They'd throw me off the force and into a straitjacket.
But I will pick up the girl and hold her for questioning.
That's all I ask.
And let's hurry.
Are you sure Paul will be at the theater?
I'm sure he will.
No, no, no.
No, call the box office.
Hello, I'm Mr. Markel.
Miss Julia Thompson is expecting us.
Just a minute. I'll have to find her.
Has Mr. Able come in yet?
Mr. Able? Could be.
So many people coming in and out, it's hard to keep track.
They're not in there.
All right.
Pete!
Inspector.
Look.
We've got to get a hold of Tom at the theater right away.
You better go out front.
The show's about to start. See you later.
Good luck.
Thanks.
Let's go.
Yes? Mr. Markel's out front.
Well, get him. It's important.
All right, just a minute.
Where is Paul?
He's probably still in Julia's dressing room.
We'll see him in the box.
Music's lovely.
Yes.
Mr. Markel.
There's a phone call for you.
It's important.
Wonder who that can be?
I don't know.
Never had so much fuss.
Phone calls, visitors.
Here, you go ahead. I'll be there in a minute.
Hello? Yeah, where are you?
I can't hear you.
Tom, listen to me. Something terrible has happened.
We found Pete dead in Lisa's apartment.
I don't believe it.
Snakebite. Same as Nick, same as Rico, same as Carl.
Yes, she's here with me.
She's out front.
Now, don't let her suspect anything, but whatever you do, hold her until we get there.
Yes, I understand.
Come on, let's go.
Call the coroner and stay here.
Paul?
Stay where you are.
Tom, be careful.
Move over there, quick.

            SWANSON. I'M        
            RUNNING A GUN CLUB  
            BACK IN THE HILLS.  
SWANSON. MM-HMM.                
WHAT KIND OF A CAR?             
            DARK GREEN          
            STAKE BED TRUCK.    
            TON AND A HALF.     
            CALIFORNIA LICENSE. 
            LOADED              
            WITH GROCERIES.     
UH-HUH.                         
WHERE WAS IT                    
TAKEN FROM?                     
            UHH...              
            THAT'S A HARD       
            QUESTION TO ANSWER. 
            LOOK, HERE'S        
            WHAT HAPPENED.      
            THE SEASON          
            OPENS NEXT WEEK,    
            AND I'M EXPECTING   
            A CROWD DOWN,       
            SO I WAS STOCKING UP
            ON SUPPLIES,        
        BRINGING THIS           
        TRUCKLOAD OF GROCERIES  
        DOWN FROM CALEXICO.     
        GET THE PICTURE?        
        WELL, I'D LEFT          
        THE CLUB STATION WAGON  
        AT SAN FELIPE.          
        GET A NEW REAR END      
        PUT IN.                 
        SO, WHEN I GOT THERE,   
        I HAD TO STOP           
        AND PICK THAT UP, TOO.  
        GET THE PICTURE?        
        NOW, I COULDN'T         
        RUN 2 CARS,             
        SO, I HIRED THIS KID    
        TO DRIVE THE TRUCK.     
        STARTED HIM OUT,        
        OH, A COUPLE OF--       
        3 HOURS AHEAD OF ME.    
        FOLLOWED HIM            
        IN THE STATION WAGON.   
        GET THE PICTURE?        
        WELL, HE WAS SUPPOSED   
        TO MEET ME HERE.        
        HE HASN'T ARRIVED YET,  
        AND THAT WAS YESTERDAY. 
HAVE YOU LOOKED                 
FOR HIM?                        
            EVERYWHERE.         
WELL, THEN, HE MUST HAVE        
GONE BACK TO THE CLUB.          
                NO, I JUST CAME 
                FROM THERE.     
YOU MUST HAVE                   
PASSED HIM UP SOMEWHERE         
ON THE ROAD                     
FROM SAN FELIPE.                
                IF I'D PASSED   
                HIM ON THE ROAD,
            DON'T YOU THINK I'D 
            KNOW MY OWN TRUCK?  
I'M SURE                        
YOU WOULD, SEÑOR,               
BUT WHAT IF IT                  
WENT OFF THE ROAD?              
        THERE'S NO PLACE        
        HE CAN PULL OFF THE ROAD
        WITHOUT GETTING         
        STUCK IN THE SAND!      
THEN HOW COULD                  
YOUR TRUCK BE LOST?             
        IF IT WASN'T LOST, WOULD
        I BE COMING TO YOU?     
[CHUCKLES]                      
THAT IS A GOOD

UH, TELL ME

        IT'S NO USE.            
    IF HE GETS ANY BETTER,      
    THE DOCTOR                  
    WILL LET US KNOW.           
    COME WITH ME. I WILL        
    TAKE YOU TO THE PLACE       
    WHERE HE WAS FOUND.         
WAS IT YOUR TRUCK               
THAT MADE THESE TRACKS?         
            MUST HAVE.          
        I HAD 2 NEW RETREADS    
        LIKE THAT ON THE REAR.  
UH-HUH.                         
CAME DOWN THE ROAD,             
THEN GOT STUCK.                 
            YEAH. THEN          
            WHERE'D IT GO?      
STRAIGHT UP IN THE AIR,         
IT LOOKS LIKE.                  
        LOOK, THAT TRUCK HAD    
        A RADIO AND A HEATER,   
            BUT IT DIDN'T       
            HAVE WINGS.         
        NOW, ARE YOU GONNA FIND 
        IT OR AREN'T YOU?       
LOOK, SEÑOR.

IN THE BOOK.                    
BUT ABOUT THIS, SEÑOR,          
I DON'T KNOW.                   
THE BOOK DOESN'T                
SAY ANYTHING

            A DAY.              
            YOU MAY HAVE READ   
            ABOUT HIM.          
SURE! COLONEL GLENN MANNING,    
THE COLOSSAL MAN.               
I REMEMBER.                     
        GLENN HAD REACHED       
        A HEIGHT                
        OF OVER 60 FEET         
        WHEN HE DISAPPEARED.    
WELL, DIDN'T                    
HE GET SHOT                     
AND THROWN OFF                  
OF BOULDER DAM                  
AND GET KILLED?                 
                THAT'S RIGHT.   
            BUT MISS MANNING    
            SEEMS TO HAVE       
            AN IDEA             
            THAT HE SURVIVED    
            BOTH THE ARTILLERY  
            FIRE AND THE FALL.  
            THAT IS WHAT        
            YOU'RE GETTING AT,  
            ISN'T IT?           
        I'LL LEAVE IT           
        UP TO MR. SWANSON.      
        WOULDN'T THAT ACCOUNT   
        FOR THE DISAPPEARANCE   
        OF YOUR TRUCK?          
LOOK, LADY, LEAVE ME            
OUT OF THIS.                    
I DIDN'T SEE                    
NO FOOTPRINTS.                  
 I DIDN'T SEE                   
 NO GIANT.                      
I DIDN'T SEE                    
ANYTHING.                       
I'VE GOT                        
ENOUGH TROUBLE                  
WITH THE INSURANCE              
COMPANY AS IT IS.               
GET THE PICTURE?                
I GOTTA BE GOING.               
        CAN YOU THINK OF ANYONE 
        ELSE WHO MIGHT HELP ME? 
THERE'S A BOY NAMED             
MIGUEL DOWN THERE,              
BUT HE'S NOT DOING              
ANY TALKING.

HE'S SUFFERING                  
FROM SHOCK                      
OR SOMETHING.                   
I'M SORRY I CAN'T               
DO YOU MORE GOOD,               
MISS MANNING.                   
        THANK YOU FOR COMING,   
        MR. SWANSON.            
GOOD DAY.                       
    GOOD-BYE.                   
        HADN'T YOU BETTER GIVE  
        HIM UP, MISS MANNING?   
        THE ARMY DID            
        SOME TIME AGO.          
YOU NEVER                       
FOUND HIS BODY.                 
        THE RIVER BELOW THE DAM 
        IS A MILE DEEP          
        IN SOME PLACES.         
        HIS BODY IS DOWN THERE  
        SOMEWHERE,              
        AND IT WILL SHOW UP     
        IN TIME.                
        YOU THINK GLENN         
        MADE HIS WAY            
        DOWN THAT RIVER SOMEHOW 
        AND REACHED THE GULF OF 
        CALIFORNIA, DON'T YOU?  
        BELIEVE ME,             
        IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.        
        I WAS IN CHARGE         
        OF THE SEARCH FOR HIM,  
        AND I KNOW.             
        THE MEDICAL AUTHORITIES 
        ALL AGREE               
        NO MAN, NO MATTER       
        WHAT HIS SIZE,          
        COULD TAKE THOSE        
        2 BAZOOKA CHARGES       
        AND A DROP              
        OF OVER 700 FEET        
         AND COME               
         THROUGH IT ALIVE.      
        WELL, THOSE ARE         
        THE FACTS.              
        TAKE MY ADVICE          
        AND FACE THEM.          
I SHALL, MAJOR.                 
THANK YOU FOR COMING.           
I'M AFRAID IT WASN'T            
WORTH YOUR WHILE.               
        IT COULD BE             
        IF YOU'D HAVE DINNER    
        WITH ME THIS EVENING.   
OH, I'D LIKE TO,                
BUT I CAN'T.                    
I'M LEAVING FOR MEXICO          
RIGHT AWAY.

            UH, DOCTOR          
            CARMICHAEL,         
            MAJOR BAIRD, THIS   
            IS SERGEANT MURILLO 
            OF THE MEXICAN      
            STATE POLICE.       
    WHERE WAS IT THE BOY        
    SAW THE COLOSSAL MAN,       
    THE GIANT?                  
         EL OGRO?               
        HE HAS NOT BEEN         
        ABLE TO TELL US.        
            THE SERGEANT        
            CAN SHOW YOU        
            WHERE THE TRUCK     
            DISAPPEARED, THOUGH.
         SÍ, SEÑOR.             
        WON'T YOU GET           
        IN MY AUTOMOBILE?       
    FINE.                       
    Murillo: THIS IS WHERE      
    THE BOY MIGUEL WAS FOUND.   
        THESE TRACKS WERE MADE  
            BY THE TRUCK        
            HE WAS DRIVING.     
        THE TRUCK APPARENTLY    
        SKIDDED INTO THE WATER. 
        IT NEVER DROVE OUT.     
            WHAT DO             
            YOU THINK, MARK?    
    IT SEEMS LIKE PRETTY MEAGER 
    EVIDENCE TO CONCLUDE        
    BECAUSE A TRUCK DISAPPEARED,
    THAT THE COLOSSAL MAN       
    IS STILL ALIVE.             
BUT THE BOY.                    
    OH, I'M SURE THERE'S        
    SOME LOGICAL EXPLANATION.   
                 SEÑORES.       
                 SEÑORES,       
                 COME QUICKLY.  
                THAT IS A VERY  
                BIG FOOTPRINT.  
    Joyce: MAJOR BAIRD, IS      
    THAT ENOUGH LOGIC FOR YOU?  
        THE FOOT THAT MADE      
        THAT PRINT IS ABOUT...  
        10 TIMES THE SIZE       
        OF A NORMAL MAN.        
        THAT WOULD MAKE HIM     
        ABOUT 60 FEET TALL.     
            GLENN WAS           
            60 FEET TALL.       
                HE MUST HAVE    
                GONE THAT WAY,  
            TO THE MOUNTAINS.   
YOU THINK HE COULD              
BE UP IN THOSE MOUNTAINS?       
            YES, IT COULD BE.   
            THERE ARE NO PEOPLE 
            UP THERE.           
WELL, LET'S DRIVE SLOWLY.       
MAYBE WE COULD FIND             
SOME MORE FOOTPRINTS.           
WHAT DO YOU SEE, LUIS?          
            THERE ARE NO MORE   
            FOOTPRINTS,         
             THE GROUND         
             IS TOO HARD HERE.  
            I SEE SOMETHING     
            OVER THERE.         
        LET'S TAKE A LOOK.      
    THIS MUST BE PART OF        
    SWANSON'S MISSING TRUCK.    
            NO, THIS IS ANOTHER 
            TRUCK, SEÑORITA.    
            SWANSON'S TRUCK     
            IS DARK GREEN.      
            BED STAKE.          
            TON AND A HALF.

        NOTHING BUT             
        A ROCK SLIDE.           
            IT IS GETTING LATE. 
            WE BETTER GO HOME.  
            IT IS NOT GOOD TO   
            BE HERE AFTER DARK. 
        THANK YOU.              
OH, NO, THANKS.                 
I HAVE PLENTY.                  
    SORRY TO BE SO LONG.        
    BUT I JUST TALKED           
TO THE MEXICAN MILITARY         
AUTHORITIES ON THE PHONE.       
THEY HAVE TROOPS                
AND ARTILLERY STANDING BY.      
ALL WE HAVE TO DO               
IS PINPOINT THE COLOSSAL MAN    
AND THEY'LL MOVE                
IN ON HIM.                      
        HE MIGHT COME WILLINGLY 
        IF WE REASONED WITH HIM.
HOW DO YOU REASON               
WITH A 60-FOOT GIANT?           
    IT'S POSSIBLE               
    HE'D LISTEN TO SOMEBODY     
    HE KNOWS WELL,              
    LIKE MISS MANNING.          
    WHY NOT TRY IT?             
NO, I--I DON'T WANT             
ANYBODY GETTING HURT.           
            PLEASE LET ME TRY   
            AT LEAST.           
NO, I'M SORRY.                  
            BE REASONABLE.      
            IF YOU USE          
            FORCE ON HIM,       
            SOMEBODY WILL       
            GET HURT.           
            VERY WELL THEN.     
            I'LL GO ALONE.      
WAIT.                           
 WAIT, MISS MANNING.            
            MISS MANNING...     
            I DIDN'T ASK        
            FOR THIS JOB,       
            I WAS ASSIGNED      
            TO IT.              
            AND IF I'M GONNA    
            GET IT DONE,        
            I'LL HAVE TO HANDLE 
            IT IN MY OWN WAY.   
WELL, IT SEEMS                  
TO ME YOUR WAY                  
IS GOING TO HURT HIM            
MORE THAN HELP HIM.             
        I HAVE TO THINK OF      
        THE SAFETY OF OTHERS,   
        AS WELL AS HIM.         
        THAT GOES FOR YOU, TOO.

        LET IT GO AT THAT?      
        WELL, YOU DON'T

THOSE FOOTPRINTS.               
        ALL RIGHT.              
        GET IN MY CAR.          
            HE'S BEEN RAIDING   
            THESE TRUCKS        
            FOR FOOD TO LIVE ON.
            THIS WAS A RIFLE.   
MAJOR, LOOK AT THIS.            
IT'S HIS THUMBPRINT.            
            THIS WAS            
            SWANSON'S TRUCK.    
        [RUMBLING]              
        WHAT'S THAT?            
I DON'T KNOW.                   
            [GROWLING]          
             [GRUNTING]         
GET BACK, JOYCE.                
            [GRUNTING]          
            [GROWLING]          
        [CRASH]                 
            [GROWLS]            
I HOPE THEY                     
ARE BAKING IT                   
THE WAY YOU WANT IT, SEÑOR.     
            I THINK             
            IT'S ALL RIGHT.     
            WHEN WILL           
            THE REST BE DONE?   
THEY SAY IT WOULD               
BE READY SOON.                  
 THEY ARE ALREADY               
 LOADING THE TRUCK.             
            GOOD.               
            TRY IT.             
            CAN YOU TASTE       
            ANYTHING?           
TASTES LIKE BREAD.              
WHAT'S IN IT?                   
            CHLORAL HYDRATE.    
            ENOUGH TO PUT HIM TO
            SLEEP FOR 8 HOURS.  
            I'LL BE             
            AT THE BAKERY.      
WE HAVE TO CAPTURE HIM.         
AND THIS SEEMS                  
TO BE THE BEST WAY.             
DR. CARMICHAEL SAYS             
IT CAN'T HARM HIM               
IN THE LEAST.                   
        ISN'T THERE ANY OTHER   
        WAY TO HANDLE IT?       
WELL, IT'S THAT OR LET          
THE MEXICAN AUTHORITIES         
DEAL WITH HIM.                  
WE HAVE NO OTHER                
ALTERNATIVES.                   
        NOBODY'S TAKEN THE TIME 
        TO THINK OF ANY,        
        AS FAR AS I CAN SEE.    
THERE ISN'T TIME                
TO TAKE.                        
IF WE DON'T GET HIM             
BEFORE HE DECIDES TO MOVE       
TO ANOTHER MOUNTAIN,            
WE MAY LOSE CONTACT             
WITH HIM FOR WEEKS.             
        I SUPPOSE YOU'RE RIGHT. 
        HIS FACE.               
        I CAN'T FORGET          
        HOW HORRIBLE IT WAS.    
WHERE YOU FROM, JOYCE?          
        MY HOME IS              
        IN SAN FRANCISCO.       
DON'T YOU THINK YOU'D           
BE BETTER OFF BACK THERE?       
        DO YOU KNOW             
        WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE   
        TO BE JUST SITTING      
        AROUND WAITING FOR NEWS?
YOU MIND IF I                   
SUGGEST A REMEDY?               
IT'S AN OLD ONE,                
BUT IT USUALLY WORKS.           
FIND SOMETHING ELSE             
TO OCCUPY YOUR MIND.            
DO YOU HAVE A JOB?              
        I WRITE COPY FOR        
        AN ADVERTISING AGENCY.  
WELL, THAT SHOULD HELP          
YOU FORGET YOUR TROUBLES.       
        I CAN IMAGINE           
        MYSELF GOING BACK       
        TO WRITING ALL THOSE    
        TIRED OLD ADJECTIVES.   
        TREMENDOUS,             
        GIGANTIC, COLOSSAL.     
        YOU KNOW WHAT           
        THEY'D MEAN TO ME NOW,  
        DON'T YOU?              
        GLENN.                  
        A COLOSSAL FREAK, MAJOR.
        AND HE'S MY BROTHER.    
            [DOOR OPENS]        
            Carmichael: WE'RE   
            ALL SET, MAJOR.     
        THIS IS NEAR THE AREA   
        WHERE HE ATTACKED       
        SWANSON'S TRUCK.        
        YOU THINK HE'LL EAT     
        THIS STUFF?             
ALL DEPENDS                     
ON HIS APPETITE.                
            THERE HASN'T        
            BEEN A TRUCK        
            THROUGH THIS ROUTE  
            FOR 2 DAYS NOW.     
            HE SHOULD BE HUNGRY.
            LET ME DRIVE, I KNOW
            THIS ROAD BEST.     
        ALL RIGHT.              
        THERE'S STILL           
        NO SIGN OF HIM.         
        IF WE DON'T             
        MAKE CONTACT,           
        WE'LL MAKE              
        THE TRIP AGAIN.         
        BECAUSE WE ARE          
        LOOKING FOR A GIANT,    
        IT DOESN'T FOLLOW       
        THAT WE DON'T           
        VALUE OUR LIVES.        
BESIDES, WE WANT HIM            
TO CATCH US.                    
AT THIS SPEED                   
HE'LL NEVER MAKE IT.            
            I DON'T             
            DRIVE THIS WAY      
            TO MAKE YOU         
            NERVOUS, SEÑORES.   
            BUT THE FASTER      
            WE GO,              
             THE MORE DUST      
             WE MAKE,           
            AND THE FURTHER     
            AWAY IT WILL SHOW.  
            BESIDES, GIANTS RUN 
            VERY FAST.          
            THEY HAVE LONG LEGS.
HE'S RIGHT BEHIND US.           
YOU BETTER STEP ON IT.          
HE'S GETTING CLOSE.             
            WHEN WE GET         
            TO THE CLEARING,    
            I WILL SLOW DOWN.   
            WE BETTER JUMP THEN.
IF WE MAKE IT.                  
            WE WILL.            
            GET READY.          
    [GROWLING]                  
    [GRUNTING]

            OUT OF HERE.

 [GROWLING]                     
    THE CASE OF ARMY COLONEL    
        GLENN MANNING,          
        THE COLOSSAL MAN        
        WHO WENT BERSERK        
    IN LAS VEGAS NOT LONG AGO,  
        IS IN THE NEWS          
        AGAIN TODAY.            
    MILITARY AUTHORITIES        
    LAST NIGHT ADMITTED         
    THAT THE EARLY ANNOUNCEMENT 
        HE HAD BEEN             
    ACCIDENTALLY DESTROYED      
        WAS AN ERROR.           
    HE WAS CAPTURED ALIVE TODAY 
            IN MEXICO,          
    AND PLANS ARE UNDERWAY      
        TO FLY HIM              
    BACK ACROSS THE BORDER      
IN A TROOP CARRIER TRANSPORT.   
        YOU MAY QUOTE ME        
        AS SAYING               
        THAT THE NATION         
        AND ITS REPRESENTATIVES 
        IN CONGRESS             
        HAVE NOTHING            
        BUT GRATITUDE           
        FOR OUR SISTER REPUBLIC 
        SOUTH OF THE BORDER     
         FOR THEIR UNSTINTING   
         COOPERATION.           
        AND WE'RE PROUD         
        OF MAJOR BAIRD          
         AND THE WAY            
         HE HANDLED THE PROBLEM 
        OF THE COLOSSAL MAN.    
        IT WAS A GOOD JOB       
        ALL AROUND.             
WELL, NOW THAT                  
HE'S BEING BROUGHT BACK         
TO THE UNITED STATES,           
WHAT DOES CONGRESS              
PLAN TO DO ABOUT HIM?           
        UH, DO ABOUT WHOM?      
WHY, THE GIANT MAN.             
        OH, AS--AS FAR I KNOW,  
        THAT MATTER             
        DOESN'T COME UNDER      
        CONGRESSIONAL           
        JURISDICTION.           
        UH, I WAS GIVEN         
        TO UNDERSTAND           
        THE DEPARTMENT          
        OF MEDICAL RESEARCH     
        TAKES OVER              
        FROM THIS POINT ON.     
        THERE'S NOTHING         
        IN OUR DIRECTIVES       
        ABOUT THE DISPOSITION   
        OF A 60-FOOT GIANT.     
    NATURALLY WE'LL DO WHAT     
    WE CAN IN A SCIENTIFIC WAY, 
    BUT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE         
    FOR THIS DEPARTMENT         
    TO ASSUME THE RESPONSIBILITY
    OF HIS FEEDING AND CUSTODY. 
    WHY DON'T YOU TAKE          
    THIS QUESTION UP            
    WITH THE HEALTH             
    AND WELFARE DEPARTMENT?     
YES, THE MANNING CASE           
WAS REFERRED TO US              
HERE AT HEALTH AND WELFARE,     
BUT WE FOUND IT LAY             
OUTSIDE THE SCOPE               
OF OUR ORIGINAL                 
APPROPRIATION.                  
I HAVE AN IDEA IT WAS           
TURNED OVER TO CONGRESS         
FOR ACTION                      
DURING THE PRESENT SESSION.     
        I CAN'T IMAGINE         
        WHO TOLD YOU TO CALL ME.
        THE PROBLEM ISN'T ONE   
        FOR THE LEGISLATIVE     
        BRANCH TO SETTLE.       
        UH, WHY DON'T YOU       
        CALL THE PENTAGON?      
    TELL THE PILOT TO CIRCLE    
    THE FIELD ONCE MORE.        
            U.S. 1-1-0-3-4,     
            YOU ARE TO CIRCLE   
            THE FIELD AGAIN.    
        Pilot, on radio: ROGER. 
    HE HAS ENOUGH FUEL LEFT     
    FOR 5 MORE MINUTES, MAYOR.  
    I CAN'T UNDERSTAND          
    YOUR NOT GIVING             
    YOUR PERMISSION             
    FOR HIM TO LAND             
    UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES.  
        I THINK I'VE MADE OUR   
        POSITION PRETTY CLEAR.  
        WE HAVE NO FACILITIES   
        FOR A GIANT HERE.       
    WHEN THAT PLANE             
    RUNS OUT OF GAS,            
    IT'S COMING DOWN            
    WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT. 
        IT CAN'T SAY ANY LONGER 
        THAN IS NECESSARY       
        TO REFUEL               
        AND TAKE OFF AGAIN.     
    TAKE OFF FOR WHERE?         
    WE NEED TIME TO DECIDE      
    WHAT TO DO WITH HIM.        
    CAN'T YOU                   
    FIND US A WAREHOUSE         
    TO KEEP HIM                 
    IN TEMPORARILY?             
        OUR WAREHOUSES          
        ARE ALL LOCATED         
        IN THE HEART            
        OF THE CITY.            
        THIS CREATURE'S         
        PRESENCE THERE          
        WOULD CONSTITUTE TOO    
        GREAT A POLICE PROBLEM. 
        NOW, THAT APPLIES       
        TO EVERY OTHER          
        LARGE DOWNTOWN BUILDING,
        INCLUDING THE COLISEUM. 
        HAVE YOU CONSIDERED     
        THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL?     
    WE CAN'T LEAVE HIM          
    EXPOSED TO THE WEATHER,     
    EVEN IF HE IS A GIANT.      
        WELL, I CAN'T MAKE      
        ANY FURTHER SUGGESTIONS.
    THAT HANGER DOESN'T         
    SEEM TO BE IN USE.          
        WELL, THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
        THIS AIRPORT IS ONE     
        OF THE MAJOR            
        TRAFFIC CENTERS         
        OF THE WESTERN WORLD.   
        YOU REALIZE             
        WHAT IT WOULD MEAN      
        IF AN UNCONTROLLABLE    
        MONSTER                 
        SHOULD GET LOOSE HERE?  
    I GIVE YOU MY WORD.         
    WE WON'T KEEP HIM HERE      
    A MINUTE LONGER             
    THAN IS ABSOLUTELY          
    NECESSARY.                  
        ALL RIGHT.              
        YOU MAY TELL THE SHIP TO
        COME IN FOR A LANDING.  
            TROOP CARRIER       
            U.S. 1-1-0-3-4,     
            YOU MAY LAND        
            ON RUNWAY 170.      
        [GROWLING]              
WHY ARE YOU KEEPING             
GLENN HERE AT THE AIRPORT?      
        WELL, I'M               
        HOLDING HIM HERE        
        TILL WASHINGTON DECIDES 
        WHAT TO DO WITH HIM.    
WHAT TO DO WITH HIM?            
HE OUGHT TO BE IN               
A HOSPITAL GETTING TREATMENT.   
        THEY DON'T              
        MAKE HOSPITALS          
        THAT BIG, JOYCE.        
        BESIDES, AS YET         
        THE DOCTORS             
        HAVEN'T TURNED          
        UP ANYTHING             
        THAT CAN HELP HIM.      
WELL, WHY DON'T THEY            
TREAT HIM WITH SULFHYDRYL?      
ISN'T THAT WHAT THEY            
SAID WOULD CURE HIM?            
        WELL, THEY FOUND IT     
        STOPPED HIS GROWTH,     
        BUT...                  
        I'M AFRAID IT           
        WON'T REVERSE IT.       
I SEE.                          
WELL, THEY CAN'T                
KEEP HIM HERE                   
AS IF HE WERE SOME              
KIND OF CATTLE.                 
            IT'S JUST           
            FOR THE TIME BEING. 
        I'M AFRAID THE WORLD    
        DOESN'T THINK           
        OF A 60-FOOT MAN        
        THE WAY HIS SISTER DOES.
    [GLENN GROWLING]            
        [GRUNTING]              
I SUPPOSE IT'S NECESSARY        
TO KEEP HIM TIED                
DOWN LIKE THIS.                 
        IF I COULD TRUST HIM,   
        I COULD LET HIM         
        HAVE MORE FREEDOM.      
        AS IT IS, I HAVE        
        TO PLAY IT SAFE.

        YOUR POSITION,          
        MR. MAYOR.              
        I CAME OUT              
        FROM WASHINGTON         
        FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE    
        OF STRAIGHTENING        
        THIS THING OUT.         
        NOW, WE'RE HERE         
        TO DECIDE WHAT'S        
        TO BE DONE WITH IT.     
HE'S SAFE NOW,                  
IS HE?                          
            WELL, HE'S TOO WEAK 
            TO BREAK LOOSE,     
            AT THE MOMENT.      
                    [SNORING]   
            HE LOST             
            CONSIDERABLE BLOOD  
            IN HIS ATTEMPT      
            TO ESCAPE.          
            BESIDES THAT,       
            WE'VE TAKEN         
            EXTRA PRECAUTIONS   
            WITH HIM.           
            LET ME SHOW YOU.

            SPECIALLY WROUGHT   
            TO STAND 10 TIMES

            CHANCE HE'LL GIVE US
            ANY MORE TROUBLE    
            FOR THE TIME BEING. 
WELL, YOU CERTAINLY             
HAVE TAKEN MEASURES,            
BUT YOU CAN'T EXPECT            
TO KEEP HIM HERE FOR LIFE.

WHAT'LL HAPPEN                  
TO HIM EVENTUALLY?              
        WELL, THAT DEPENDS.     
        YOU SEE ANY HOPE        
        THAT HE'LL EVER IMPROVE?

    WELL, THE BIG               
    QUESTION NOW IS             
    HIS MIND.                   
    HE MAY BE SUFFERING

    IN THAT CASE,               
    WE HAVE TECHNIQUES NOW      
    THAT WILL BRING             
    HIM OUT OF IT.              
    ON THE OTHER HAND,          
    IF HIS BRAIN TISSUE         
    HAS SUFFERED INJURY,        
    HE'LL BE                    
    A PSYCHOPATHIC CASE         
    AND A MENACE                
    UNTIL HE DIES.              
            IS THERE ANY WAY    
            OF TELLING?         
    AN EXAMINATION              
    WOULD DO THAT.              
            HOW SOON CAN YOU    
            PROCEED WITH IT?    
        [TELEPHONE RINGS]       
    ALMOST IMMEDIATELY.         
            PLEASE, DO SO.

            WHAT'S TO BE DONE   
            WITH MANNING

        WE'LL KEEP YOU POSTED,  
        GENERAL.                
            AND I'LL CHECK      
            WITH YOU            
            BEFORE I RETURN TO  
            WASHINGTON, MAJOR.  
        YES, SIR.               
        BUT I TELL YOU,         
        A MAN'S LIFE DEPENDS    
        ON THIS PLASMA.         
        I KNOW 10 GALLONS       
        IS A LOT,               
        BUT DR. CARMICHAEL      
        EXPLAINED THE CASE      
        TO YOU THIS MORNING.    
        I CAN'T SIT HERE        
        AND ARGUE ABOUT IT.     
        IT'S NEEDED RIGHT AWAY. 
        JUST A MOMENT, PLEASE.  
        DR. CARMICHAEL.         
        WILL YOU TALK TO THE RED
        CROSS PEOPLE, PLEASE?   
        THEY REFUSE TO SEND ANY 
        MORE PLASMA FOR GLENN.  
         THEY SAY WE'VE USED    
         TOO MUCH ALREADY.      
    MARK.                       
THIS IS MAJOR BAIRD.            
MY MEN AND I WILL SEE           
THAT YOU GET BACK               
ALL THE BLOOD WE USE            
FOR THIS CASE.                  
NOW, YOU SEND OVER              
WHAT WE NEED IMMEDIATELY.       
THANK YOU.                      
GOOD-BYE.

        IF ONE HAPPENS

WELL, WHAT WOULD                
THAT TELL US?                   
        IF HE RESPONDS          
        TO ANYTHING, IT MEANS...
            CURABLE AMNESIA.    
            IF NOT...           
I UNDERSTAND.                   
        WILL YOU GET THIS       
        NOW, PLEASE?            
    [GLENN SNORING]             
            THIS IS FAR ENOUGH. 
            DR. RICHARDSON?     
HOW'S THE                       
EXAMINATION COMING?             
            COMING ALONG FINE.  
                I'LL BE DOWN    
                IN A MINUTE.    
        I'LL GET                
        THE INSTRUMENT READY.   
        COULD YOU               
        HOOK THIS UP, PLEASE.   
        BILL, BRING A PROJECTOR.
        SET IT UP OVER THERE.   
IS THE SCREEN GOING TO BE       
ALL RIGHT UP THERE, DOCTOR?     
            YES, THAT'S FINE.   
        ANY OPINION YET,        
        DR. RICHARDSON?         
I'VE NEVER SEEN SUCH            
DREADFUL FACIAL INJURIES.       
HOW WERE THEY SUSTAINED?        
            WHEN HE FELL        
            FROM BOULDER DAM,   
            HE MUST HAVE HIT HIS
            HEAD ON THE ROCKS.  
        OF COURSE, THE WOUNDS   
        WENT UNTENDED,          
        SO SCAR TISSUE FORMED   
        AS YOU SEE IT.          
THE SHOCK OF SUCH               
A FALL WOULD INDICATE           
THE POSSIBILITY OF AMNESIA,     
WOULDN'T YOU SAY?               
            MM-HMM.             
WELL, THAT'S STANDARD.          
I GET A NORMAL                  
NERVOUS REACTION.               
THAT'S CERTAINLY NOT            
TYPICAL OF AMNESIA.             
LOOKS LIKE BRAIN TRAUMA,        
I'M AFRAID.                     
ARE YOU READY                   
FOR THE ASSOCIATION TEST?

        IT WAS RED, AND         
        IT HAD A LIGHT ON IT.   
        OH, WE HAD FUN

        THEY'RE SHIPPING HIM    
        OUT TOMORROW MORNING.   
        THE NAVY HAS A SHIP     
        READY TO TAKE HIM       
            TO THE ISLAND.      
        IT'S A SMALL ONE ABOUT  
        60 MILES OFF THE COAST. 
THAT DOESN'T LEAVE              
US MUCH TIME.                   
            IT'LL TAKE ALL NIGHT
            TO GET HIM READY.

PARACHUTED DOWN TO HIM.         
HE'LL BE SUPPLIED               
WITH EVERYTHING HE NEEDS.       
            JUST THE SAME,      
            IT'S HORRIBLE.      
THERE'S NO PLACE                
IN THE CIVILIZED WORLD          
FOR A CREATURE THAT BIG.        
YOU SEE WHAT'S                  
HAPPENED TO HIM.                
HE'LL BE HAPPIER                
BY HIMSELF.                     
        OH, I SUPPOSE I SHOULD  
        AGREE WITH YOU, BUT...  
        I CAN'T HELP FEELING    
        TERRIBLY SORRY FOR HIM. 
LOOK AT IT THIS WAY,            
GLENN HAS BECOME                
A TOTAL STRANGER TO YOU.        
HE'S NOT YOUR                   
BROTHER ANYMORE,                
BUT A...MONSTER.                
WITH THE INSTINCTS              
OF A WILD BEAST.                
AND THERE'S NOTHING             
YOU AND I, OR ANYONE ELSE       
CAN EVER DO THAT                
WILL CHANGE HIM BACK            
TO WHAT HE ONCE WAS.            
        [CHAIN SNAPPING]        
        [GROANING]              
        WILL HE BE ALONE

INSPECTION PARTY EVERY MONTH.

        I WONDER WHAT'S         
        GOING ON DOWN THERE.    
MAYBE THE MARTIANS              
HAVE LANDED.                    
        THE TEACHER'S           
        BEEN CALLING US.        
LET HER CALL.                   
BOY, LOOK AT ALL                
THOSE SEARCHLIGHTS.             
        I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET    
        SOME OF THE OFFICERS    
        WORKING HERE            
        WITH THE ARMY           
        TO RESTORE ORDER.       
        ANY TROUBLE WITH THE,   
        UH, PUBLIC CAUSING      
        CONGESTION OF THE       
        DISASTER AREA?          
NOT THIS TIME.                  
THEY SEEM TO BE                 
KEEPING THE ROADS               
PRETTY WELL OPEN FOR US.        
        I UNDERSTAND            
        YOU WERE ABLE           
        TO GET EVERYONE         
        OUT OF THE PARK         
        BEFORE ANYTHING COULD   
        HAPPEN TO THEM.         
THAT'S RIGHT.                   
        WELL, WE REALLY         
        APPRECIATE YOU MEN      
        AT A TIME LIKE THIS.    
            OH, OFFICER.        
        THERE WAS A SCHOOL BUS  
            FROM WESTMONT       
            JUNIOR HIGH         
        UP AT THE PLANETARIUM   
        TONIGHT.                
            DID YOU SEE IT      
            COME DOWN?          
ALL CARS WERE CHECKED OUT       
OF THE PARK SOME TIME AGO.      
            ARE YOU SURE?       
            MY DAUGHTER         
            LAURIE WAS ON IT.   
            I'VE BEEN WAITING   
            FOR HER             
            DOWN AT THE CORNER. 
            YOU SEE, WE LIVE    
            IN GLENDALE.        
            AND I THOUGHT IF    
            I PICKED HER UP HERE
            AND DROVE HER HOME, 
            SHE COULD           
            GET HER SLEEP.      
            SHE HAS TO GET UP   
        SO EARLY IN THE MORNING 
        ON SCHOOL DAYS.         
        WELL, I BROUGHT HER COAT
        IN CASE SHE'S COLD.     
WAIT A MINUTE,                  
AND I'LL CHECK.                 
            THANK YOU.          
                Woman: ARTHUR!  
                LAURIE!         
            WE BETTER GO NOW.   
        THERE'S NOTHING         
        FOR YOU TO WORRY ABOUT. 
        THE BUS IS STILL        
        UP THERE,               
        BUT IT SEEMS TO BE SAFE.
CAN'T I GO THROUGH?             
LET ME GO TO                    
LAURIE, PLEASE.                 
 SHE OUGHT TO                   
 HAVE HER COAT.                 
I WANTED HER                    
TO TAKE IT                      
WHEN SHE LEFT                   
THE HOUSE THIS MORNING.         
ONLY I FORGOT                   
TO REMIND HER.                  
        SHE'LL BE ALL RIGHT     
        WITHOUT IT.             
        JUST YOU TAKE IT EASY   
        AND WAIT RIGHT HERE.

Sorry, Miss Jan.
Sam, l'd think by now, you'd know every hole in this road.
I know all the holes, Miss Jan, but on this road there's no place to go but in them.
Well, it's a good thing
Africa hasn't completely changed.
I was afraid after 10 years you'd be driving me home on a super-highway with drive-ins on both sides.
Nothing much has changed in this part of Africa, Miss Jan, not in 10 years, not in 50 years.
Sam!
Sam! Stop, you hit a man!
It wasn't a man. It was one of them. l'm truly sorry, Miss Jan, but l couldn't stop.
There's your grandma, now.
She'll tell you l was right.
She's waiting for you.
You're trembling.
We hit a man.
Ran over him not a mile down the road.
Sam wouldn't stop. l saw him, ma'am, with the seaweed on him.
He stood in the middle of the road and tried to stop the car.
Get Miss Jan's things up to her room.
But that man. He's badly hurt, or dead.
There's no one on the road.
Remember that! l saw him! Sam saw him! He admits it.
Go inside now, and freshen up, Jan.
So you still believe in this voodoo? l thought it was a nightmare from my childhood. l thought everything would be different now.
Later on, Jan, you'll decide for yourself. l'm sorry it had to start like this on your first night back.
Here's to a calm crossing, which we already had!
The hook dragged anchor at 18 fathoms.
Okay. Okay. Lower the launch.
Okay, sir.
No, l don't want any more, thanks.
And here's to a million bucks in diamonds, which we're soon going to have.
You're getting drunk.
Why not? ln a few days, l'm going to deck that lovely beautiful body of yours with diamonds from head to toe.
Now what would l do with diamonds on my toes?
Never mind. lt was a sweet thought.
And what are you going to do with your diamonds, Jeff?
Me? l'm going to stuff mine in a nice little box l rent at the First National Bank in New York.
Oh, now that's real romantic.
You're listing to port, Mona.
Your husband's the man over there.
Can't you take a friendly little kiss without trying to make something out of it?
How about me, Mona?
Don't l get a kiss, too?
You don't get a cut of the diamonds, Doctor.
Well, if l had known what went with them l would have insisted on a share.
Well, listen to the old boy! A regular Romeo.
The launch is ready, sir.
Who's that?
Help!
-l hit it. Both shots.
-Fool! l tell you, l hit him, whoever it was.
-Both times.
-More likely you hit Johnson.
What?
He's dead. l couldn't have hit him. l'm not that drunk. l don't think you did. His neck's broken.
Well, who did it? Who was that?
Get the others. Let's get him to shore.
Who was it?
You wouldn't believe me, Jan.
You didn't learn such things at school. l thought it was a man. l saw him walk right into the water. l came down to watch the ship arrive. l didn't expect them so soon.
But after what happened to you on the road l knew they'd be here tonight.
Mrs. Peters? l'm Doctor Eggert. l've been expecting you.
This is my great-granddaughter, Jan Peters.
How do you do, Miss Peters?
This is George Harrison. Mrs. Harrison.
And this is our diver, Jeff Clark.
-One of my men has just been murdered.
-l know. l heard the voices and the shots.
What's going on? l wrote. l warned you of the danger.
You mean that voodoo stuff? lt was a man. l fired at him.
And you hit him. But it didn't help, did it? l want the police.
The police will do you no good,
Mr. Harrison. They're far away.
We'll have to bury the poor man.
-Tonight?
-Well, he's dead.
We may as well bury him. lf the police want to dig him up later that's their business.
There's no casket but l'll get someone to sew him up in sailcloth.
These are the graves of the first group that came after the diamonds.
That was in 1906.
They were British.
This was a German expedition in 191 4 just before the outbreak of war.
What l want to know is, how did they all die, Mrs. Peters?
Another British group tried their luck in 1923.
Portuguese in 1928.
The first Americans showed up
10 years later, 1938.
Yours is the sixth attempt to recover the diamonds.
Whose graves are these?
The first one is for your dead sailor.
The others for the rest of us.
She's trying to scare us.
She wants the jewels for herself. l've learned that no one who comes for the diamonds can be frightened away.
Give me a hand.
That grave, it's for me! l know it. Get me away! Please.
-l'll get her to bed.
-Let them have the large guest room.
According to Eggert, the Susan B is lying in about 100 feet of water on a sandbar.
-Say, where is Eggert?
-He's having a pow-wow with the old lady.
Maybe he can find out why the old lady was so anxious to have those graves dug in advance.
Now, if the sandbar hasn't moved, it should be about here.
Well, this one baffles me. lt's pre-Christian, of course, but it doesn't seem to be truly African.
You know, it's closer to those figures on Easter lsland than anything l've seen.
You've picked the prize of the collection quick enough. l guess you do know something about Africa.
Just who are those people you're with?
Well, as l wrote you, l've spent 20 years researching the legends of the Susan B.
Mr. Harrison owns the salvage ship.
He came for the diamonds. l came for the story. l think l'd die happy if l could complete the research on my book.
Not that l'm eager to occupy one of those graves.
Only fools are afraid of the grave.
There are worse things.
Bodies around here must be buried quickly, Dr. Eggert.
-You mean, the climate?
-No! l don't like to explain to idiots who think l'm in my dotage.
But, you should understand.
The walking dead?
You believe in them?
And so will you, before the week is out.
My husband,
Captain Jeremy Peters of the Susan B.
He was one of them.
That picture was made over 60 years ago.
He looks almost the same today, except for the eyes. l've seen him.
You know the story.
The Susan B put in here for trade in 1894.
The sailors discovered a temple with a golden casque full of uncut diamonds.
They stole the casque. There was a fight.
And 10 of the sailors were presumed dead, the Captain among them.
The others returned to the ship with the casque.
Then, surprisingly, the 10 missing men appeared.
Something happened.
The rest of the crew were slaughtered and the ship scuttled in the bay.
You think that these 10 men that had been killed returned to their ship?
They were dead then and they're dead now.
But, they're still guarding those cursed diamonds.
One of them killed your sailor tonight.
They've killed everyone who's come for the diamonds.
But they're murderers! Your own husband...
They're dead, l tell you!
They have no morality, no free will.
They'll kill anyone who tries to steal the diamonds.
But what about you?
They don't bother me. They seem to know l don't want their precious treasure. lt was more than 50 years ago that l heard rumors that my husband was seen around here.
And l came back to find out.
Slowly, l pieced the story together. l built this house.
You want to be with your husband, this dead man? l came to help him return to dust, to find his eternal rest.
But how? How can you do that?
Oh, that fool woman, again!
Jan!
Fire!
That's the only way to fight them. lf you'll listen to me l'll help you get the diamonds.
Where'd he go?
You'll never find him.
Well, l'm clearing out.
Diamonds or no diamonds, l'm getting out of here.
-You're staying.
-George, you saw that thing! l came here for the diamonds. l'm staying and so are the rest of you.
But if you knew there'd be all this trouble, people killed, why did you let them come? l didn't let them do anything.
Eggert wrote and told me they were coming.
-l don't own the diamonds or the bay.
-But you wanted them to come.
Yes! l want them to find the diamonds and then destroy them!
Only when the diamonds are destroyed will your grandfather be able to rest.
Destroy them?
Do you think Harrison is the kind of man who would destroy the diamonds after going to all the trouble of finding them?
Throw them away because of an old wives' tale about men who died 60 years ago but aren't dead? lf they ever find the diamonds they'll be glad to destroy them. l know what l have to do!
And this time, there'll be an end to the diamonds, and an end to the walking dead.
Hello.
Weren't you afraid it was a zombie out here? l understand they don't smoke.
They're afraid of fire.
-Then you know all about them, too?
-Only what my grandmother says.
-And you believe her?
-No.
Then who broke into the house tonight?
Who killed Johnson? l wish l knew. l wanted to ask you to leave, with the others.
Give it up before any more are killed.
-Do l look like l'm afraid of zombies?
-But Johnson is dead, and so are many others buried behind the house. lt's not worth the risk.
Oh, yes, it is. lf those diamonds are half of what they're cracked up to be, my share may come to a million dollars.
-That's a lot of loot.
-What is it worth if you're dead?
Oh, look, Miss Peters, l may be a dumb diver, but l got A in Arithmetic at P.S. 81 .
That's in New York.
And this is the way it figures.
Usually, as a diver, l make 100 bucks a day.
And if l'm lucky l work three days out of every week.
That's 15 grand a year.
Now, do you know how many years l'd have to work to make a million?
Sixty-seven years.
You'd better go back to school and learn how much 60 years of life is worth, or 50, or 20, or even 10.
All right, l'll make you a promise. lf l get that million, or even half, l'll give up my dangerous occupation. l'll never dive into anything deeper than a swimming pool.
Or, if that makes you nervous, l'll stick to very dry martinis.
Not funny? l didn't think you'd listen.
There's something else.
Tonight, when Sam was driving me home we hit one of those men, not a mile down the road.
We hit him hard, ran over him.
We must have killed him. l'd like to find out.
So would l.
Can we get the car?
They're supposed to be afraid of flares.
Even if l agree with you and wanted to quit, it's not my show. lt's Harrison's equipment and Harrison's money.
That's why he waltzes off with three-quarters of whatever we find.
Right there, just ahead. l think l see something.
-lt was right over there.
-Be careful.
Looks like water. lt sure isn't blood.
-This where it happened?
-Just about here.
-Maybe a bit down the road.
-Let's look.
The remains of your headlamp.
You must have hit something right here.
-What is it?
-Seaweed.
Water and seaweed?
Do you suppose he could have come from the bay?
He just suddenly appeared on the road.
Footprints!
Facing toward the road.
So, he did come from the direction of the bay.
He must have been hit back there where we found the glass and the button.
He was thrown a few yards and run over down there.
Let's go back and see what we can pick up back there.
Jan, you take one side of the road, and l'll take the other.
See if you can find some more footprints.
Jeff!
He just picked himself up and walked away. l'd like to follow these.
-Tonight?
-No. l'll get something to mark the place.
We'll come back with the others in the morning.
Jan, can you hear me?
Try to get away while l back them down with these flares.
Jan, come on, we've got to move!
That should hold them.
Lucky you brought that Very gun along.
What made you think of it? l remembered how that old lady drove off that joker last night with the torch. l didn't know where the girl was taking me. l figured she was leading me in for a setup.
So, l grabbed the Very gun from the locker.
You say this mausoleum in the middle of the jungle is about 40 by 20 feet.
And no running water or central heating. lf you like, we'll pack a picnic lunch and walk over there.
Do you think you could find it again?
Well, l should.
You kept me up all night making notes.
You know, doc, you're going to have to cut me in on the royalties from your book. l think you're right the first time. l'll give you odds, Little Miss Sweetness and Light was leading you into a trap.
You can bet that she and that old witch are at the bottom of what's going on.
-Good morning.
-Good morning.
Warm milk, Margaret. l want to thank you for saving Jan's life, Mr. Clark.
She's very precious to me and l'll be always grateful.
Now, you've got a friend for life, Jeff.
We all die in good time, Mrs. Harrison.
There's a grave waiting for all of us.
You old hag! You're dead already. You just don't have sense enough to lie down.
-Shut up!
-Well, it's true.
She's at the bottom of what's going on around here, and you all know it. l'm sorry, Mrs. Peters, but, you see, she learned her manners as a hostess in Eddy's Front Street Saloon.
-She...
-As l was saying, l'm grateful, and l'll do whatever l can to help you recover the diamonds.
Thanks, but it won't make any difference now.
-You see, l've decided to give it up.
-What? You can't quit like this. l practically taught you the business.
You should have taught me the business end of the business.
Then, l'd be up on deck taking a sun bath and getting 75 percent, while you went below and played footsies with the fishes.
We made a deal. l've sunk $30,000 into this, practically everything l've got.
Get yourself another boy.
Do the diving yourself.
Nobody told me there'd be a crew of cut-throats pushing up the odds.
And l don't care who's behind them.
Okay. l'll give you another five percent.
Maybe he's right, George.
We ought to quit.
This place gives me the creeps.
-One more word out of you, and l'll...
-What'll you do? Put me in irons?
What do you want? l did some arithmetic last night, Harrison.
You know, 50 percent isn't hard to resist.
-l hope you live to collect it.
-Oh, but l intend to.
You see, l'm counting on you to keep me alive, at least, until after we get the diamonds.
We're losing the whole morning.
-Good morning.
-Good morning.
Good morning, Miss Peters.
-You all right?
-So, you're going ahead?
Yeah. Harrison talked me into it.
Ask Mrs. Peters.
But l tell you, l buried that knife in his throat.
-So, you missed a vital spot.
-Okay.
But l should have got a little blood out of that eight-inch blade.
Do you believe in the walking dead, Doctor Eggert?
All l know is what l've read.
What does it say in the books, Doc?
Are they supposed to be good swimmers?
Well, they wouldn't have to breathe.
Well, that's my weakness. l have to breathe.
Try to remember that, Harrison.
-Any last words?
-Just find the diamonds. l'm only going to try and locate the cabin.
Fifteen minutes.
Don't get yourself killed, Jeff. lt would be such a waste.
Can you hear me?
Telephone okay?
Air pressure okay?
All right, let's go.
...twenty-four, twenty-five.
Twenty-five feet. How is it?
Water's clear.
But I don't see anything yet.
This ''A-number one'' helmet
of yours is leaking, front port gasket.
Where'd you get it? In the surplus store?
-Is it bad?
-Not yet. Keep it coming.
Fifty feet.
Get the other suit ready.
Seventy-five feet. How's the leak?
No worse.
-Do you want to come up?
-No. Not yet.
Lower away.
I see something! Right under me.
Easy.
I'm looking right into the hold.
We're in luck.
I think I can walk right into the hold.
Maybe I can get in right now.
You want to try?
Yes. lt's no dive at all. lt's less than 100 feet.
But why go down? You're not in condition. l'm not going to let him get his hands on those diamonds without me being there.
I see it! I see the safe!
Start hoisting.
Jeff, can you hear me?
Are you inside?
-Jeff!
-What's happened?
Air pressure reads zero. ls he free? Can you haul him in?
-He seems to be coming up, unless...
-Unless what?
Unless the cable snapped.
Well, why don't you go down and see?
Well, this is the quickest way.
Keep them rolling.
He's alive.
We'd better try to get him to a doctor.
The nearest doctor is at the Angel Mission.
That's five hours driving each way. l do the doctoring around here.
Over my dead body.
Well, it's his breathing. lf we don't do something to help that quick, he may not come out of it. l'll fix something for him.
You're not gonna let her feed him anything, are you?
Well, what do you think?
-Well, l don't think she's a murderess, but...
-She's out of her head! l don't know if he's breathing at all now.
This will stimulate his breathing.
Give him about an ounce every hour.
Well, it's not that we distrust you,
Mrs. Peters, but...
Put it down.
Give it to him or not, as you please.
Wait! lt's potent, but it won't hurt you. l'll let you know if there's any change.
Okay, Florence Nightingale.
Call me when you're ready to go off shift.
Hit me. l just can't stand the excitement.
Exotic Africa.
Wild animals and tropical nights.
Here l am teaching a professor how to play blackjack. l have 21 .
Well, okay. So he owes you another thousand matchsticks.
Relax.
Well, why doesn't she tell us what's going on?
She just told you a half an hour ago.
He's sleeping peacefully and breathing normally.
What do you want, a bulletin every 10 minutes?
-Well, l'm going to see for myself.
-Don't start any trouble.
-How do you feel?
-No. No, don't stop. l guess l finally made it.
Soft clouds, golden stairways, trumpets, and angels.
Not a chance, Jeff.
You're in Africa!
And from where l sit it looks a lot more like the other place.
Why didn't you call us when he wakened?
-He just did.
-Oh, sure!
What goes on here?
You getting time and a half on this job?
Why didn't you call us? l told you, l didn't want any trouble!
What do you expect the phony caveman act to get you? l told you to stay away from him.
Now, l'm going to give you the only kind of lesson you seem to understand!
You'll have to come back!
-How's Jeff?
-He's okay.
We'll talk to him after a while about what happened at the wreck.
They say of the walking dead, that their souls can find no eternal rest, that they exist in torment. lf only people could find peace of soul and mind while they're alive.
We've had that fire going for two hours now. lf Mona could see it, she could have found her way back.
Once you're inside that tangle, you can't see very far.
She wouldn't have ventured into the jungle by herself.
They have her, l'm sure.
We'll have to go after her then.
-To the graveyard?
-l'll go too.
-Sure you want to go along?
-Well, l'd like to help.
This won't be any sightseeing expedition. lf they've had her this long it won't do any good.
They'll get you all. lt should be right about here. l clocked it on my way back last night.
You want to use the Very gun again?
You want a gun, Doc?
No, thanks. l'll take an extra flashlight.
All right, let's go.
Here's the path.
Art and Johnny, you two bring up the rear.
Keep a close watch out on both sides.
Doc, you stay in the middle.
You stay close behind me.
And don't fire unless you have to.
All right, let's go.
Hey, wait a minute. lt's Mona's bracelet. lt's on the other side of the boulder.
The old lady tells me this was a European cemetery for the people who dug the diamonds 100 years ago.
Art, Johnny, you two stay here. lf any of them show up try the flares.
-You want to come with us?
-l'll go.
Okay. You carry the gasoline.
-She's dead.
-Maybe not.
We'll get her, but let's figure on getting out of here, too.
Doc, empty the gas on both sides of the door.
All right.
Okay. Now, keep your eyes on them. l'll be right behind you. l'll try and hold them back with these flares.
She is dead.
Let's get out of here!
Mona! Look!
Mona! Are you all right?
Get her out of here! l'll cover you!
Okay. Come on!
They found you!
You're all right. l'm so glad...
She's as cold as...
She is all right, isn't she?
She hasn't said a word.
Maybe she's been drugged or in shock. l think you'd better get her to bed.
She's dead.
Your wife is dead, Mr. Harrison.
You saw her walk in here.
You all saw her walk...
Look at her eyes. She's not breathing.
Cold as death. l won't listen to that crazy talk.
You hear me? Now, no more of it.
-l'm going to put her to bed.
-Not in this house.
-Oh, please, Grandmother.
-We can take her out to the ship.
No. l know this is your house, but l'm not going to move her tonight.
Now, if you're afraid, you get out. l'm not afraid for myself. l'm afraid for you, for all of you.
Miss Peters, would you help me put her to bed?
Of course.
What about us?
Let them stay, the first bedroom.
We may need them.
Mona, why don't you close your eyes and get some sleep?
Jeff, you up?
-How's Mona?
-No change.
-You willing to go down tomorrow?
-Well, the safe's right there. l figure one more dive and we should be able to get to it.
Why?
You want to pull out? l ought to think about Mona. l ought to get her to a doctor.
Help! Help! Jeff! Harrison! She's crazy!
-Help! Help!
-Mona!
Jeff, help me! l can't stop her!
Light more candles. Lots of them.
He's dead. She knifed him.
Then she went for me.
Tell Sam to bring up all the big candles he can find.
Now force her back to her room with these.
They're afraid of fire. l guess it's the only thing that can destroy them.
She's sick, Mrs. Peters.
She's out of her head, isn't she? l'm sorry, Mr. Harrison. l know exactly how you feel.
Put a couple more in the doorway. lf fire'll work here, it'll work underwater, too.
Keep that blaze like that, and they won't bother you.
-They'll stay inside.
-l understand.
-Unless they have another way out.
-lt's worth a try.
We might have them bottled up.
Anyway, you and your men will be all right if you stay near the fire.
We'll be here.
Let's go.
The way l figure it, it can't be much of a safe. l should be able to cut it open in five or ten minutes.
Now, while l'm burning off the hinges, you stand by with another torch. lf any of them do show up, you hold them off with your torch.
Hope that fire keeps them out of circulation. lt'll be dark before we're through.
About that damaged compressor, l'm glad we found out before we dived.
We could wait till tomorrow. l thought you wanted to pull out tomorrow and get Mona to Dakar.
-Another day won't matter.
-Look, day or night, it's dark down there.
Besides, tomorrow l might have cold feet, like you've got now.
Okay!
Doc, you take care of the intercom so we can talk to each other, huh?
Sure thing, Jeff.
-Harrison, can you hear me?
-I hear you.
-Air pressure okay?
-Pressure's okay.
All right, I'll go ahead.
You follow at 10 feet. And watch my line!
Go ahead.
Good luck, Jeff.
You too, George.
I'm on the bottom.
Can you hear me, George?
I hear you, and I see you.
Feed me some more line.
All right, Jeff.
More line.
She's a real old clunker with outside hinges!
You know,
I think I can get into her with a scout knife.
Stuff is burning like firewood.
I'll have the first hinge off in a minute.
-Jeff! They're all around me.
-Can you hold them off?
I don't know.
I'm working on the second hinge.
-How much longer?
-Just one more minute.
I've got the hinges off.
I've got it.
I need 10 seconds to get out of here.
I can't hold them off! I'm going up!
Take me up! Take me up!
Send the diver stage down.
There are two of them waiting to jump me.
I want to make sure my lines are clear.
And when I give you the word,
start winding away like mad.
We understand, Jeff. Give us the word.
It worked! Where's Harrison?
He's just breaking surface now.
They're all over him! Four or five of them.
Use the flare.
Send down the diver's stage.
Wind me up clear of the deck.
What's with Harrison?
He's lost a lot of blood. He's in his cabin.
-We're running out of flares.
-Save them.
-Look! They're coming on board.
-Get the torches and the kerosene.
Yes, sir.
Let's see if we can keep it.
Take it to the cabin and lock yourself in.
Patrol the decks.
That torch can set us afire.
-How many flares left?
-Two, sir.
Keep that bunch covered. Come on.
Fire one into their laps. l'm going to pick up that torch.
Johnny! Behind you!
Doc, open up! Let me in!
You got some lighter fluid? Cleaning fluid?
Anything that'll burn?
Yeah, in the desk drawer.
-Give them those lousy diamonds!
-Don't anybody try that.
-You got a better idea?
-Yeah, we'll fight our way out.
Who's going to carry you while l do the fighting? l'll manage.
-You're in great shape for running.
-l'll be all right in a minute. l'll take this and make a break for it. lf l get through, l'll head for shore in the launch.
They'll follow me, and that'll give you a chance to get away.
Don't try it, Jeff.
You want it so bad, take it!
-He won't get far with those diamonds.
-You are a fool, Harrison.
-He's not trying to steal the diamonds.
-Shut up.
Well, he saved your life and mine. That's more than you could do on your bad leg. l know him better than you.
Break out that dinghy.
-You're safe! l was so worried. l saw the...
-Later! We've got things to do. Come on.
Maybe she's coming out of it.
Mona!
They sure have her hypnotized.
Come on.
So, you succeeded where all the others failed. l thought you might.
Listen, there's a whole flock of them after this. They'll be here in a few minutes, and they're playing pretty rough. And l don't want to be around here when they get here.
And l don't want Jan around, or you, either, Mrs. Peters. l figure we can get into the car, take Mona, and clear out.
We can meet up with Harrison at Dakar.
Well, l'd split my end of the take with you. l figure you've got something coming after all these years.
That is, if there is a take. l'm still not sure we found the diamonds.
-How do you get this open?
-lt's older than the Pyramids.
They didn't have any springs or screws, of course.
But they did know something about levers. Usually...
Give me your scarf quick.
Get the launch and start it up.
We'll be going back to the boat in two minutes. lf any of them show up, hold them off with the torches. lf they come near, l'm leaving.
Tell the girl to bring me that chest.
Tell her if there's any funny business, l'll shoot you for trying to steal the diamonds and deserting us while we were under attack.
Well, that's not true!
He took all the risk himself.
-Listen, Harrison...
-l haven't the time.
Peewee and Johnny are getting steam up.
Mike and Tony are waiting at the launch. l'm taking Mona and the diamonds out of here. l just wrote a new deal.
Give it to him.
Maybe, you got it open.
How are you going to know?
-No, please, don't, you'll ruin it.
-l'll find a way.
You follow me, l'll kill you.
But the diamonds should really be yours.
You found them, you saved them.
Thanks, Doc. Come here.
We have to make a run for the launch.
You understand?
Come on!
Go on! Get in!
He's dead.
She did it.
-lt happened so fast.
-Let's get him inside.
But you don't even know for sure if they want the diamonds.
Maybe they just wanted the chest.
We could have seen the end of them.
They want the diamonds.
They'll be back when they find the chest is empty.
But how could l destroy them even if l wanted to?
Cast them to the winds.
Scatter them over the sea so that no man'll ever find them.
Come with me, Jan.
We can be on the ship in a few minutes and out of the bay in 10 more.
Where will they catch us, in New York?
No matter where you go, they'll follow you.
Well, l'll get rid of the diamonds fast. l'll turn them over for cash.
They'll be sold in every capital in the world.
What would they do? Picket all the jewelry stores on Fifth Avenue?
Look, Jan, l want you with me. l want you to enjoy the money, too. l want you to marry me. l think l'd like that, Jeff. l can't go. l can't leave like this.
You mean, you believe all this, too?
That if l dump the diamonds they'll disappear?
Yes, it's true.
They'll stop walking the Earth.
They'll find their eternal rest.
The diamonds must be destroyed.
You can't rob them of this.
Jan!
She believes.
She's spent a lifetime believing.
You can't rob her of this.
Well, l can't throw them away.
Maybe l wish l could.
But l'm gonna take them with me.
And you're coming with me, too.
Both of you. l can't leave you behind, not when they're still prowling around. l'm staying right here.
But you can't stay here now. lt's too dangerous.
-l'm sorry, but if l have to, l'll carry you.
-l believe you would.
We don't have any time, Mrs. Peters. l'll put you off wherever you say. lf you like, l'll arrange to get you back here later.
Help her in.
Wait!
They've returned for the diamonds.
-What are we waiting for?
-Please, not yet.
We're safe enough now.
Captain Peters.
Must you go on?
All right.
Okay, take them.
The diamonds, Mrs. Peters.
They're yours. Do what you want with them.
Thank you.
Thank you.
At last, Jeremy Peters.
At long last. l'll probably never be rich again.
Quiet!
We are ready for you now, sir.
- First patient.
- Come on.
For your information, gentlemen... this is a straightforward amputation of the lower extremity of the femur.
And to you students, again I emphasize the absolute necessity... for speed.
That was a good day's work,
Bolton, eh?
You're getting faster all the time.
Beats me how you do it.
No matter how fast I am,
I still can't save them that terrible agony.
Yes, most distressing, but, alas, inevitable.
You can't have operations without screams.
Pain and the knife are inseparable.
I beg to differ, Mr. Blount.
Someday surgery must and will be made painless.
I've got to go. It's getting late.
- Go straight home. You've done enough work.
- I have patients waiting for me.
You're not still fooling with that free dispensary of yours in Seven Dials.
I can't understand why a distinguished surgeon of your ability... can squander his valuable time prescribing castor oil and stomach pills... for a group of miserable wretches.
And how else will those miserable wretches, as you call them... get any kind of medical attention?
That's a matter for the authorities.
True, except that they repudiate the obligation and do nothing.
I really think that setting aside one afternoon a week... is the very least that I can do.
You're spending more time than that, Bolton.
On top of it all, there are your chemical experiments.
If I were you,
I should tread a little carefully.
- People are beginning to talk.
- Well, let them talk.
In the meantime,
I'll do what I think is right.
- Good-bye, Father. I'll see you this evening.
- Oh, yes. Susan's expecting you.
Don't be late.
Pity your father's so squeamish, Jonathan.
But perhaps he's not quite the same with his, uh, charity patients.
Vegetables! Five baskets!
Buy, buy, buy!
Vegetables! Five baskets!
Buy 'em by the bulk!
Buy, buy, buy!
Buy, buy, buy!
Buy, buy, buy!
There's a pig with a curly tail!
There's a Yorkshire pig.
There's an Hampshire pig.
There's a pig without a tail.
There's a long-tailed pig.
There's a short-tailed pig.
There's a pig with a curly tail!
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Off with you.
Well, now, what's that?
It's my Addie's foot, sir.
She's cut it.
Well, now, Addie, we'll just have to have a look at that, won't we?
You sit there, darling.
Now we'll see what's wrong.
Now, Addie.
That's not hurting too much, is it?
Now, there's a good girl.
How did she get a cut like this?
On a bit of glass outside the theater where she sells fiowers.
It's a very bad cut.
There'll be no more fiower selling for a week or two.
- No, sir. I'll keep her home.
- I mean what I say.
You keep this child off her feet... or she'll be hopping around on a crutch for the rest of her life.
I will, sir.
I swear I will.
There we are, Addie.
Safe and sound in just a little bit.
Use this ointment.
See that she has a clean bandage every day.
God bless you, sir.
I'll see she comes to no more harm.
It's hard enough without the money she brings in.
Yes, I suppose it is.
If it doesn't heal, come see me in a week.
But don't wait any longer.
Here. Take that.
Oh, thank you, sir.
Good day to you, sir.
God bless you again, sir.
Bye, Addie.
It's a good thing you're not gone, Doctor.
Oh, Ben, you're way past my time.
Now, what do you want?
It's a poor fellow over in my lodging house, sir.
He's got a fever, and he's coughing his heart up, sir.
- Can't your wife take care of him?
- She's doing that, sir.
But I'm telling you, Doctor, he's bad.
We thought he'd burst his lungs.
Oh, Doctor, you must come.
All right, I'll come.
I can cut through to Oxford Street from your place. That's where my carriage is.
Go ahead.
Yes!
Get outta here!
Let's go.
Rachel. Rachel!
Rachel! He's coming.
Rosa! How often have I told you to keep this door closed?
This place must breed a hundred fevers.
You're right there, Doctor.
I furnished it cheap when they pulled down the old smallpox hospital.
- Where's the patient?
- He's upstairs.
He's on my own bed.
This may not be much of a place, Doctor, but we do have consideration for the sick.
What's the matter, Doctor?
Don't you recognize your own handiwork?
- Came out of the hospital only a week ago.
Frightened out ofhis wits, he was.
You fxed him up good, Doctor.
Half a leg and half a brain.
That's all you've left him with.
He's still in a state of shock.
They should never have discharged him in this condition.
Come on, out of the way, Nick.
We got work up aloft.
Ben! Ben!
He's dead. He's dead.
Ah, easy now, Rachel. Easy.
It's no good, Doctor.
He couldn't hold on any longer.
The wife upsets very easy, Doctor.
We'd best go and see for ourselves.
Well, give me a light.
Closer, woman.
Let me see him.
What happened?
It was an awful coughing ft.
And then there was a sound as if his ribs was rattlin' to pieces.
Terribly undernourished.
Consumptive, I'd say.
Strange.
No signs of a hemorrhage.
- Who is he?
- A beggin' letter-writer.
One of the best.
Name is Scrivener Sam.
As good a man with a pen as you'd ever see.
Is there anyone to bury him?
It'll be a pauper's grave, Doctor, but we'll see him to it.
But as you know, we got to have a certifcate for the authorities.
This new act of parliament.
Very strict, you know.
We can't bury him without a proper certifcate.
I'll make sure that he's laid out nice and proper, Doctor.
Yes.
See that he gets a decent burial.
Needn't worry yourself about that, Doctor.
It'll be all aboveboard.
- May I see you out, Doctor?
- Don't bother.
Ben, I warn you.
If any of your lodgers are taken ill like that again... get them to the hospital before it's too late.
Yes, Doctor.
Take him to the hospital, he says!
He don't know how right he is! joe!
I told you he'd sign.
No need to get scared.
Yeah.
If we can do it once, we can do it twice.
And more!
Come on! Drink up!
To profit and no comeback?
- Did I do it right, governor?
- None better, Resurrection.
I told you chokin' would look natural, didn't I?
- What do you want?
- Just looking.
I been hearing some strange talk.
Well, forget it.
Come on.
Get back to your room. joe, you get the tea chest up here.
- Ned'll get the cart.
- Yeah.
The hospital'll pay us well for him.
The body's nice and fresh... and we got evidence that shows as he died all neat and tidy-like... according to the law.
It's a nice body, governor.
You have the death certifcate?
Huh! Signed by Bolton.
That's right, governor.
One of his charity patients.
Uncle, you've hardly touched your food.
I'm sorry, Susan.
I just don't feel like it tonight.
- You've been working too hard.
- Susan's right, Father.
That dispensary's too much on top of your work in surgery. You can't do both.
Maybe I should give up surgery.
How can you say that?
You're the finest surgeon in the hospital.
Oh? What is a surgeon?
How do you judge his work?
It's to cure, isn't it?
- Sometimes I wonder.
- What are you getting at?
Today, in Seven Dials...
I came face-to-face with one of my so-called successful operations.
There he was... his mind destroyed by shock and pain.
A fine tribute to my skill.
I tell you, Jonathan, I can't rest until we find some way to rid surgery of such horrors.
But, Father, your dream of lulling people into unconsciousness... there's nothing new about that.
People have been trying to find a way for centuries.
Even so, I am determined, through my experiments, to find that way.
It just isn't possible.
Perhaps Blount was right.
Perhaps pain and the knife are inseparable.
Don't tell me you believe such wicked nonsense!
But we only know of one way to reduce the agony... operate quickly.
And, Father, you have a sureness and a speed unmatched by anyone.
- Why waste time with foolish experiments?
- How dare you say I'm wasting my time!
Now, stop it, both of you!
Well, I don't understand how two of you can be so stubborn.
I'm sorry, Father.
It's all right, Jonathan.
But I am making progress.
One of these days
I'm going to surprise you both.
And we're going to help you in every way that we can.
Of course we are.
- I must get back to the hospital.
- Can't you stay for a little while?
No, I'm sorry, Susan, I can't.
I'm on call tonight.
Well, we won't delay you.
Don't be late.
I've asked Cook to fx you a hamper.
Why? Don't you think they feed me properly at the hospital?
I'm sure they don't. And I think it's a shame they make you live on the hospital grounds.
Well, very soon I'll be qualifed as a surgeon.
Then I can live where I please.
- Good night, Father.
- Good night, Jonathan. Good night, my dear.
There's cold chicken and one of Cook's game pies.
Do you really expect me to walk through the streets carrying this thing?
Go on, you ungrateful wretch.
You know, Susan, keeping house for my father suits you.
- You're looking very lovely.
- Thank you, sir.
- Good night.
- Good night.
This experiment will test the properties... of a strange gas... prepared with nitric acid and granulated zinc.
Uncle. Uncle, what's happened?
What are you laughing at?
Uncle, what is it?
What is it?
Why are you laughing like that?
Stop it!
Uncle!
Get hold of yourself.
Get hold. Be still! Be still.
Uncle. Uncle, be calm.
Sit down.
Sit down quietly.
Uncle, what have you done to yourself?
You frighten me, laughing like that.
But, Susan, you're dreaming.
I've been working.
I'm not dreaming.
You've cut your hand. Look at it.
Look at it.
You slashed it on the glass.
- I was here. I saw you.
- What?
- Didn't you know? Didn't you feel it?
- No.
Uncle, you've done it.
You didn't feel it.
You've done it!
Uncle!
You didn't feel any pain.
But why shouldn't it succeed?
I've performed a dozen experiments since the night I gashed my hand.
It's all here.
And it works, I tell you. It works.
Well, Tom, the idea's certainly a novel one, but...
When can I give a demonstration?
Well, permission from the chairman... and the house committee would have to be obtained.
- Then there's the question of a patient.
- I have my man already picked out.
Uh-huh. I see.
- And he has agreed to take the risk?
- Risk?
There's no risk, providing the patient's heart and lungs are sound.
Well, I'll put your request before the committee.
Point out to them what it would mean to the hospital... to be able to say that the first operation without pain... was performed within these walls.
Now, look, Tom, are you sure you're ready for a demonstration?
I know I am.
Charles, it'd be a crime to let that agony go on a day, an hour longer than necessary.
Well, it's your reputation that's at stake and not mine.
Let's hope your optimism is justifed.
Well, now, if the committee agrees... shall we say Monday week at 3:00?
Good. I'll be ready.
Ah, Mr. Donnevan.
May I present our chairman?
- Mr. Donnevan's from Guy's Hospital.
- How do you do?
- And this is Mr. Hammerton from the London.
- How do you do?
What?
Bolton's late.
Maybe he's put himself to sleep.
Careful with it, Peter.
Uncle, I... I hope all goes well.
Of course it will, my dear.
Look how many times I've tested my patient.
- Good luck.
- Thank you, Susan.
Father, I have some bad news for you.
- Your patient's dead.
- What?
What happened?
Sudden stroke.
You can't go through with this now, Father.
You'll have to cancel the demonstration.
Have people say I was afraid to put my theory to the test?
Certainly not.
We must find another patient.
- But you can't possibly...
- We must!
You there.
Not you. You.
What's wrong with your arm?
Abscess, gov.
Hurts something terrible.
- Come with me.
- What are you gonna do, cut it?
It's all right. You won't feel a thing.
All right, Jonathan.
Come on.
You'll be all right.
- Where are we going?
- There.
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
I must apologize for being late.
Ah, Mr. Bolton. I understand you have something new to show to us.
Be so good as to explain to these gentlemen what it is you're going to demonstrate.
Thank you, sir.
Good luck, Tom.
All right, Jonathan.
Come on. In the chair.
Go on.
Well, now, gentlemen... by using this special formula... which contains nitrous oxide... and which I will administer through this inhalator...
I propose to render the patient insensible.
Which one is the patient?
I will then operate upon his arm... and he'll not feel the slightest pain.
No straps will be necessary.
I'll believe that when I see it.
It's all right.
It's all right. Now, here.
Hold that between your teeth.
Now breathe deeply.
Deeper.
Order, gentlemen, please!
Now let's try it again.
Deeply.
Again.
Deeper.
Again.
Laugh at me, will ya, ya dirty butchers?
I'll show ya!
Come here!
You can proceed with your demonstration now, Mr. Bolton.
Your patient is unconscious.
Uncle, what happened?
Did it go badly?
The gas didn't put the man to sleep.
The whole thing was like a circus.
Thank you, Peter.
In spite of today's failure...
I am convinced that the answer to painless surgery... now lies within my grasp.
For a few vital seconds, the patient was completely oblivious... to the pain of the knife.
However, the formula must be strengthened... so that the patient remains unconscious... until the operation is completed.
Tonight I propose to conduct a further experiment on myself... this time using a much stronger formula... containing a tincture of opium.
Pain and the knife are inseparable.
Pain and the knife are inseparable.
No, no. You're wrong. You're wrong.
Fixed him up good, Doctor.
Half a leg and half a brain.
That's all you left him with.
Now, governor?
Nah. Wait a while.
He'll be easier to handle then.
There's another lad who'll never earn an honest penny again.
By all that's holy, look at that!
Here, out of the way, Joe.
Well, Doctor!
This is an unexpected pleasure.
Where is he?
I must find him.
The hospital should have let me know.
Now, now, Doctor, take it easy there.
By the looks of it, you've been makin' a night of it?
The one-legged man... where is he?
I must help him.
We sent him away for a nice, long rest.
- Haven't we, Joe?
- That's right, governor.
He's nice and peaceful now.
Well, what are you all staring for?
Strike up there!
Come on, Doctor.
Come and sit down, eh?
Well, it's nice to see you here again, Doctor.
Have a little drop of this.
It'll probably do you good.
No, no, I don't want anything.
Thanks.
The one-legged man, he's the one
I came to see. Where is he?
Where is he? L...
I'm not feeling quite myself.
Perhaps you're right. By the looks of things, you have had a bit too much.
If I can't help him, I must get back.
I shouldn't be here.
I must get back.
Well, we'll see you home safe and sound.
- Won't we, Ned?
- Don't worry, gov.
I'll take care of him, all right.
Come on, sir. Come on.
Yes. There. There.
Come here, you little rat!
Now, what have you got, eh?
That's the boy.
All right?
A nice lie-down.
There you go. Up with you.
You feelin'...
All right, Rosa,
I'll take care of him.
Ben wants you downstairs.
You'll be all right.
Nice and comfortable.
I had no idea you were down here.
Uncle, have you been up all night?
Six hours.
I've been trying a new formula.
It works.
But...
I seem to have had a dream, a strange dream.
It's all so vague.
- You look so tired. Come have some breakfast.
- Later, Susan, later.
I must make some notes first.
That's odd.
Can't find my notebook.
- It was right here.
- It can't be far away.
Don't worry.
Ellen and I will find it after breakfast.
Uncle, do you really think you should go to the hospital today?
Why, of course.
In any case, I have to arrange for a further demonstration.
All right, but have your breakfast first.
Come on.
I thought there was something funny going on.
He's been experimenting on himself, taking gas.
It's all here. Experiment one right up to experiment 53.
- Do you think he'll be back?
- Don't worry. He'll be back.
How can you be sure of it?
You mark my words.
When he finds his precious notebook is missing, he'll come crawling.
And when he does, we'll be ready.
Come on, Rosa.
What are you doing?
Get out of here!
Served you right. You should know better than to fool around with him.
Someday you'll wiggle that bottom of yours just once too often.
Come on, Rachel.
We've got work to do.
Yesterday we were privileged to witness... the dismal failure of Mr. Bolton's demonstration.
But let us not be too disappointed, gentlemen.
It was bound to fail.
Ever since surgery began... man's destiny has been to suffer... in order that he might be cured.
And no one can change that, gentlemen.
Not even Mr. Bolton.
Now let us get on with our work.
Mr. Williams.
Will you be so good as to demonstrate upon this cadaver... as to how you would propose to cut through the radius and ulna?
Oh, Mr. Chairman.
- Good morning, Mr. Bolton.
- How fortunate.
The superintendent said I could have a word with you before the committee meeting.
- Very well, Mr. Bolton.
- I've made startling progress.
I'm most anxious to set the date for another and, this time, successful demonstration.
I'm sorry, Mr. Bolton.
That is a matter for the committee to decide.
Precisely what I wanted to talk to you about.
I wonder if my request could be put forward on today's agenda.
After what happened,
I do not think this is the proper time... to broach the subject either to me or to the committee.
- However, I suggest you speak to the secretary.
- Excuse me, gentlemen.
- Time to open the meeting, Mr. Chairman.
- Thank you, Mr. Hardcastle.
Oh, be so good as to instruct Mr. Bolton... when it'll be convenient for the committee to discuss the advisability...
Advisability?
The advisability of his conducting a further demonstration... of his... painless operation technique.
- But...
- Of course, Mr. Bolton. At your service.
- I thought perhaps this morning...
- Not today, Mr. Bolton. Please.
Perhaps if you were to come into my offce tomorrow, or the next day.
- It's time that I join the others.
- I must insist that I get another hearing.
Thank you, Mr. Bolton.
Thank you.
This is a disaster.
That notebook contains the details of every experiment I've ever made.
Without it I'm lost.
We've ransacked the house from top to bottom.
It's nowhere to be found.
But, Susan, the committee won't allow me another demonstration without those records.
It must be somewhere.
Perhaps if you could get a good night's sleep, you'd remember where you left it.
Perhaps. Perhaps.
Well, you go to bed. I'll deal with it.
Good night, Uncle.
What were those proportions?
Pain and the knife are inseparable.
Oh, no. You're wrong.
If I had my notebook,
I could prove it to you.
Notebook.
Ben!
In the tavern, just out of jail
An old lag sits with a pint of ale
He likes his food
He likes his song
He likes the women to think he's strong
Blimey. There he is.
In the tavern in a perky hat
Sits a girl who holds a skinny brat
She looks at him when she feels sad
He reminds her of good times she's had
But he never cries or makes a din
'Cause she fills his bottle with lovely gin
Lookin' for this, Doctor?
That's my notebook.
It was stolen from me.
Not so fast, Doctor.
Please. Please!
- Now...
- No, no. Don't destroy it. I must have it back.
You hear that, Rachel?
The doctor wants his book back.
All right, Doctor.
You can have it back.
But you'll have to sign a little bit of paper for it.
- Won't he, Joe?
- Sign?
Take him upstairs, Joe.
Give 'em a jig!
Let's have some life!
What are they gonna do to him?
You keep your nose out of what doesn't concern you.
Go on. Get back to the customers.
This way, gov.
That's Jim Simmons, typesetter.
I treated him for his hand. That's all.
It's like I said, Doctor.
You can have your precious notebook.
All you have to do is to sign this death certifcate.
It's already filled in neat and proper.
I can't sign that.
I don't know how he died.
You're gettin' too particular, Doctor.
It's a favor for a favor, Doctor.
You want your book, the hospitals want bodies.
They pay us well, eh, Rachel?
He died peaceful, governor.
Come on, Doctor.
Sign the paper.
It's as Ben says... a favor for a favor.
No harm done.
- Go ahead, governor.
- You'd better make up your mind, Doctor.
No certifcate, no notebook.
No notebook, Doctor.
In my last few experiments, as I inhale... my whole being is stimulated for a short time.
And then as I continue...
I experience the strangest and most evil dreams.
But try as I may, upon awakening...
I cannot remember them.
And there are times when my memory fails me completely.
This notebook, which I thought that I had lost... was actually in the pocket of my cape all the time.
Uncle, your breakfast.
It'll be cold.
- Why, you've found your notebook.
- Yes, my dear.
It was in the pocket of my jacket after all.
I must be getting absentminded.
- Now, that proves you're overworking.
- Nonsense. I'm all right.
You won't be able to work this evening at any rate.
Why not?
Uncle, you are getting absentminded. You invited
Superintendent and Mrs. Matheson to dinner.
To tell you the truth,
I had forgotten.
Aren't you doing yourself serious harm by inhaling these gases?
Oh, Susan, I'm so close to success.
You wouldn't want me to stop now, would you?
- Morning, Baker.
- Morning, sir.
I'd like to collect this list of chemicals after I've finished operating.
Yes, sir.
Twenty ounces tincture of opium.
Fifty ounces of vitriol.
A hundred grains laudanum?
I'm afraid I haven't got those quantities on my shelves, Mr. Bolton.
Why not? You know my requirements are heavy.
You should keep your supply up.
I wish you'd explain that to the committee.
They've instructed me to economize.
Those chemicals are essential for my experiments.
If there's any question, tell the committee that I will accept full responsibility.
Very well, sir. If you say so.
Father, I know you've finished operating, but there's a child here you ought to look at.
- What's wrong?
- It's her foot.
Her mother says you examined her at the dispensary at the Seven Dials.
Doctor, all of a sudden it seemed to get worse.
I thought I'd better bring Addie straight here.
Why the devil didn't you keep her off her feet? I warned you.
We needed the money real bad.
I brought her as soon as I could.
This child has been in agony for days.
The foot's badly infected.
We'll have to operate.
Of course.
Come on. Let me take her.
That's right.
If he doesn't hurry, the child will bleed to death.
Father, no.
This one.
It was bound to take time.
And the girl has a very good chance of recovering.
I know, I know. But speed has always been the essence of your father's skill.
I wonder what can be keeping your uncle.
It's unlike him to be so late.
Oh, I expect he's been delayed at the glass foundry.
He's probably forgotten all about the time.
Don't you think your father's becoming too absorbed in those experiments ofhis?
Well, he has been working much harder since his demonstration failed.
He was hoping that would prove so much.
Well, maybe that accounts for his not being himself.
Is he still carrying out those experiments on himself?
Yes. Yes, I'm afraid he is.
Ah, but surely that must be affecting his health.
Oh, my dear Mrs. Matheson.
How nice to see you.
- Oh, well, well, Tom.
- Charles, my dear fellow.
- I apologize for being late.
- Oh, well.
I must say, Mr. Bolton, you missed an excellent dinner.
I went to the glass foundry to pick up the new inhalator... a much improved design that will def...
Jonathan, my dear fellow, more brandy for Doctor Matheson.
What a poor host you are.
And here are those reports that you insisted
I make out for the committee.
Now, I want them in their hands first thing in the morning.
Aye, well, uh...
Don't you think it might be a good idea i-if you took a holiday... before continuing your researches?
Nonsense. I'm perfectly well.
Never felt better in my life.
- Oh, but believe me, Thomas...
- But there's not that much time to waste.
Now, please prepare a demonstration as soon as possible.
Oh, don't press me too hard, Thomas.
You'll destroy all you're trying to do if you don't learn to control your impatience.
Please, Charles, don't bully Mr. Bolton.
Mr. Bolton, tell us something of what it is that you're trying to do... that is, if you think that we're capable of understanding.
You doctors fill your conversation with such technicalities... that, of course, we do find it rather diffiicult...
Such a delightful evening.
I always admire this house so much.
Well, good night, Susan, dear, and thanks for a pleasant evening.
- Good night.
- And good night, Tom.
Good night, Charles.
Good of you to come.
Good night, my dear.
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Good night, Uncle.
- Sleep well.
- I will, my dear. I will.
I think your father's taking our advice.
It's the first time in weeks he's gone to bed early.
Now, if we could only persuade him to go away for a while.
I think you could persuade anybody to do anything.
Father.
Father!
Father, I don't think you should operate today.
I'll be all right as soon as I start working.
I'm a little tired, of course.
If you could only see yourself.
You're a sick man, Father.
We're ready for you, Mr. Bolton.
- What's the matter with Bolton?
- Do you think he's ill? jonathan, please continue.
He's handing over to his son.
It was almost murder.
I saw it with my own eyes.
The man's a danger to the public.
Nobody's safe while he has a knife in his hand.
- He's gone to pieces.
- Mr. Bolton has been overworking. That's obvious.
- He... He needs a holiday.
- Holiday? Why not suspend him altogether?
Yes, the chairman is right.
After today's exhibition, the whole of London will know that Bolton is finished.
You know what hospital gossip is like.
News of this kind travels fast.
But you can't dismiss a man like Bolton with a snap of the fingers.
Sir.
Please, will you let me handle this?
You sent for me, Mr. Chairman?
Eh, Tom...
We think you're ill.
We, uh, want you to give up your duties at the hospital for a time.
Perhaps you're right.
It seems I can't control my hands anymore.
Oh, Thomas, you're one of the finest surgeons we have.
We don't want to lose you.
Now, why don't you take that holiday we talked about?
Forget your experiments for a while.
Forget my experiments?
But that's impossible.
I'm ready for my next demonstration.
Mr. Bolton, the committee have decided against holding any further demonstrations.
Well, Charles, have you lost faith in me too?
The decision is for your own good.
I tell you, you can't stop me.
Operations without pain are possible... and I'll not rest until I prove it to you... to all of you.
Baker, I'm going away for a while, and I'll need this list of chemicals.
Certainly, Mr. Bolton.
If you will be so good as to leave it with me...
I'll see that you have your supplies as usual... when you return from your holidays.
- But I must take them with me.
- I'm sorry, sir... but those are the committee's instructions.
Good day, Mr. Bolton.
- Where's Father?
- He's in the laboratory.
He's been there for hours.
- What's happened?
- He's been suspended from the hospital.
What?
I'll explain to you later.
I've got to talk to him.
Father.
Father, it's Jonathan.
The superintendent told me what happened in the chairman's offce.
I'm sorry, Father.
- Is the patient all right?
- Yes.
Thank God.
Well, I'm finished as a surgeon.
Good thing you were there to carry on.
Father, don't talk like that.
Well, at least it sets me free to concentrate on my work here.
I suppose it's no use trying to convince you that these experiments can only lead to further disaster.
Oh, but you're so wrong, my boy.
Look. I'm convinced that I have here the formula that will lead to painless surgery.
There. jonathan, I...
I need your help.
The hospital won't give me any more supplies.
Look. Look here.
There. That's all that I have left.
Father, can't you realize the hospital stopped you for your own good?
But that's the only place that has these chemicals.
Weeks ago I ordered them specially.
Why won't you face the truth?
Father... you've become addicted to these inhalations.
They're affecting your mind and your body.
I never thought a son of mine would turn against me.
- Father, I'm only...
- Get out!
I tell you,
I must have those chemicals.
A bargain's a bargain, eh, doctor?
You keep your end of it, and I'll keep mine.
You just sign these certifcates as they are.
We'll fill the rest in later.
Eh, Joe?
Are you sure you'll help me?
Come, come, Doctor.
Black Ben's a man of his word.
Like I said, a bargain's a bargain.
Mr. Bolton.
What are you doing here, sir?
There was no need for that.
Get on with it.
Come on, governor.
We'd best be getting out of here.
What are you doing here?
You're in Black Ben's, Doctor.
Morning, Doctor. just in time for a bite to eat.
Go on, Doctor. Sit down.
I'll get you something.
Go ahead, Doctor. Sit down.
Why am I here?
What happened?
Did ya hear that, Rachel?
The doctor don't remember.
Go on, Doctor, help yourself.
Some hot food in your stomach will do you good.
Maybe this'll refresh your memory.
Morning, governor.
Evans, the night porter...
Oh, no.
I must get to the hospital at once.
If I was in your shoes, Doctor,
I'd lie low for a bit.
- Ben.
- Huh?
The police were snooping around the doctor's dispensary, askin' for him.
Like I said, Doctor, you'd better keep out of sight.
You can rest easy here.
There's none better than Ned the Crow for spotting the peelers.
After all, if you look after us, we gotta look after you.
Eh, Joe?
As far as the police know, poor Evans was knocked down from behind and then... stabbed to death.
What kind of chemicals were stolen?
We won't know that until after the dispenser checks his inventory.
But I fear the worst.
If we only knew where he was.
If... If we could just talk to him.
- I should never have left here last night.
- It can't be true.
It just can't be.
Begging your pardon, Miss Susan.
There's an Inspector Donovan here.
He'd like a word with you.
Show the inspector in, Ellen.
Thank you.
Forgive me if I intrude, but I was hoping to talk to Mr. Bolton.
I'm afraid he's out.
I'm Jonathan Bolton.
I assist my father.
Can I help you, Inspector?
Yes, perhaps you can.
We wish to verify your father's signature on this death certifcate.
Yes, that's his signature.
You will notice that the handwriting above differs from the signature.
I wonder if you recognize it.
No, I'm... I'm afraid I don't.
I... I've never seen it before.
Can you tell us what this is all about, Inspector?
We have reason to believe that
Mr. Bolton has somehow been tricked... into signing false death certifcates.
- Are you sure of that?
- Quite sure.
Well, I've taken up enough of your time.
Please tell Mr. Bolton that it is essential that we speak to him as soon as possible.
Thank you.
- Good day.
- I'll see you out, Inspector.
Ben.
Get out of here, will ya?
How's the doctor?
Having a bout with his conscience, I'd guess.
He'll only give us trouble.
We ought to get rid of him.
And Jonathan was right.
I have become an addict.
And what I have imagined as terrible dreams... are in fact reality.
And even now, knowing that I've caused the most terrible crimes...
I cannot resist the craving for another inhalation.
Sir, I don't think we should wait any longer to question Mr. Bolton.
- You say he hasn't returned home.
- There's no trace of him anywhere.
You realize, Donovan, without corroborating information from Mr. Bolton... we have very little evidence to support this raid of yours.
But these people have disappeared from the Seven Dials.
And Mr. Blount has practically admitted... that he's none too careful about how he gets his bodies for his anatomy classes.
Black Ben's our man, sir.
I'd stake my life on it!
Very well, Donovan.
But take along some good men.
You'll get little welcome in the Seven Dials.
Thank you, sir.
Ah, there you are, my friend.
You look as if you could do with a nice hot rum.
You know, you're just on top of Black Ben's... the best lodging house in the Seven Dials.
Come on.
Good work, Thompson.
Now take your men through this alley and around to the backyard.
- Keep well covered.
- Yes, sir.
He's outlived his welcome.
He needs looking after.
Only make certain that what's left of him is found far enough away... so as to have no connection with this place.
No need to worry, governor.
It'll all be taken care of, nice and tidy.
No need to be frightened, governor.
It's the peelers! Every man for himself!
Come on. This way. All of you.
Go on. Go on. Get through that door.
Go on. Away you go.
Let me go!
What's the meaning of this?
Disturbing honest folk at this time of night!
The house is surrounded.
We've orders to search.
You'll find nothing in this house!
Stand aside, Ben.
Come on, Joe. Bolt it.
Come on. Up over the roof.
- It's best I finish 'im.
- Be quick!
Take him away.
It's Thomas Bolton!
We'll get you to a hospital, sir.
No time for that.
My son, Jonathan, and Susan... get them quickly.
Yes, of course.
Fetch an ambulance.
Go on!
There he is.
You're finished, Ben.
Might as well come down.
Take the other men round to the back entrance.
You can't escape that way, Ben.
We've got you surrounded.
Go and fetch Inspector Donovan.
Come on!
Put me down!
Let me go, you lousy copper!
Ben!
Father.
It's no use, Jonathan.
It's too late.
The inspector will tell you the whole story.
Dear Susan... forgive me for what I did.
I was too anxious to prove my theories.
But, Jonathan... somewhere within these pages... lies the answer to painless surgery.
I beg of you to carry on.
Prove... what I failed to prove... that pain and the knife... can be separated.
I will, Father.
I promise you.
I'll see that nothing stands in his way.
For centuries the prayers of Mexico's peasants...
...have been their only shield against the devastating furies...
...that have wrecked their homes and destroyed their lives.
And so today, again, they kneel...
...terrified and helpless as a new volcano is created...
...by the mysterious and rebellious forces of nature.
The earth has split a thousand times.
Whole acres of rich farmland have cracked and dropped from sight...
...and millions of tons of molten lava are roaring down the slopes...
...in a quake recorded on the seismograph of the University of Mexico...
...as the most violent of modern times.
To the benighted citizenry of this remote countryside...
...the most alarming aspect of the phenomenon...
...is the fact that its unabated hourly growth is without precedence...
...having reached a towering height of 9000 feet within a few days...
...and with each added foot, it spreads its evil onslaught into a wider circumference.
But what is now most feared is that rescue work will be severely hampered...
...by the hazardous inaccessibility of the terrain.
Well, there she is.
Yeah.
How much further do you suppose, doc?
Three days on this washboard and that volcano looks as far away as it ever did.
Nobody stuck a gun in your back to make you become a geologist.
Yeah, but you don't have to rub it in.
"San Lorenzo, 12 kilometers."
If there was any other village within 50 miles...
...a sign like this could confuse people.
It looks like somebody else has been here.
Yeah, army truck, maybe. Police.
Don't get me wrong, doc.
I love this Mexico of yours...
...but up around here,
I think I could stand a little company.
For my information, Hank, how did you get permission so fast?
From my group, I mean.
After all, red tape and that sort of thing.
Simple. I just told them the truth:
That you needed me along as an interpreter.
That may be true, but I think the language you really spoke best...
...was with our secretary who secured all the documents for you.
I didn't use Spanish with her.
That was sign language.
Incredible. Truly, isn't it?
If these estimates are right, this quake may be as severe as Mount Pelée...
...Vesuvius, San Francisco.
Lucky there are so few people up here.
Well, there were enough.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- How far you come, fellas?
- Mexico City.
- We left on Monday.
- Where do you want to go?
San Lorenzo. How far is it?
Do you know?
Who knows how the bridges are.
Maybe a couple of hours.
A police car went by just before sundown.
They didn't come back, so maybe they got through okay.
Was San Lorenzo hurt badly?
Who knows? The telephone lines are down since the earthquake.
- Thanks a lot. See you later.
- Take it easy.
- What the devil was that?
- I don't know.
Ordinarily, I've got nothing against moonlight nights...
...but I'll be glad to get by this one.
It looks like a farmhouse up ahead.
Maybe we can get some water up there.
I hope so. I'd like to save those last two bottles of beer.
Well, no gas station ever looked better.
- Hello?
- Anybody home?
I'll see if I can find a well.
Hey, hello in there.
I wonder if we can have some water for our jeep.
- Hey, Hank!
- Yeah?
Come here!
Look at this.
Over here too.
What do you suppose...?
Look at that!
What do you make of it?
It must be that patrol car those telephone men saw...
...but I certainly have no idea what could have happened or why.
What could do this to a car out here?
You don't suppose they're trying to walk to San Lorenzo?
511. Calling 511. Do you read me?
Sergeant Vega, do you read me?
This is headquarters calling 511.
Hello. Hello, do you read me?
511, I read you, Sergeant Vega.
What's your location? Sergeant Vega?
Here, you better take this.
You're head man down here.
- Hello.
- Go ahead, please.
This is Arturo Ramos, professor of geology from the university.
My associate and I came upon this patrol car. There has been an accident.
I believe we're a few kilometers south of the village of San Lorenzo.
- Where's Sergeant Vega?
- He's not here. No one is here.
The car is badly damaged, but there's no blood.
- Did the car run off the road?
- No. Frankly it...
Didn't the sergeant make a report after the accident?
- The radio's working.
- We have heard nothing.
Thank you, professor.
Leave the patrol car as it is.
We shall order military intelligence to send a unit to San Lorenzo immediately.
We will.
Well, we're not doing any good here, pal.
Hank, some of my countrymen may like rattlesnakes in the house.
- I can do without them.
- Let's take a look.
That rattlesnake is the worst kind of them all.
Come on, fella. There you go.
You've had practice, Mr. Scott?
I guess so, with four brothers and two sisters.
What do you suppose caused this wreck?
That police car out there?
It could've been a bull.
If it was, it had to be the grandpappy of the biggest bull that ever was.
Hank?
You did notice the beans were still hot on the stove?
- Yep.
- So?
When I've already got a dozen questions
I can't answer...
...I try to ignore any new ones.
Do you think we ought to radio them about the kid?
Nope, I think we ought to get to
San Lorenzo as quick as we can.
Look at that kid.
Not a peep out of him.
If I ever have any of my own,
I'll feed them beans and tortillas too.
Then I'll be able to get some sleep nights.
Hey, wait a minute.
Every cartridge has been fired.
Hello. Hello? We only found
Sergeant Vega and the baby.
I have that, professor. Right. You said
Vega's revolver had all chambers fired.
Yes. All.
- At what?
- We wish we knew too.
Thank you again. The emergency unit will be in San Lorenzo tomorrow.
- Right.
- That's all.
We're from Mexico City. We're from Mexico
City. We're scientists. Is the mayor here?
Hernando, rest for a day or two.
Rosa, don't let him try to do too much.
Father! Father! They come.
Padre Delgado, the road is open.
- Help is here.
- From Mexico City.
At last, thank God.
Ask them in Spanish.
Welcome to San Lorenzo.
I am Father Delgado.
Arturo Ramos, of the university.
Dr. Henry Scott, from the United States.
- I'm afraid I can't introduce this one.
- Manuel Tiburcio! And the parents?
They weren't there. I think it might be better if we discuss this inside, Father.
Dead! They were dead!
And now, Father, do you believe there is a demon bull...
...killing us all one by one?
- Perla!
I'll take Manuel. I'll take him with me.
But I will not protect him from the devil just by lighting candles!
Gentlemen, I know you are weary after your journey.
Can I offer you what hospitality the village may provide?
Thank you, Father.
That car, Father, just pushed in as though it were paper.
And finding the sergeant with a look of death none of us had ever seen before.
- Then this isn't the first time?
- The first Sunday after the eruption...
...various of the congregation were not in church.
This is understandable, you realize, travel might have been impossible.
Then the Tiburcio family simply vanished.
The farm, as you have described, ravished as by some giant being.
- But there were no bodies.
- None until last Thursday.
Since then, a young girl.
She was crossing the field to spend that night...
...with cousins, was found in the morning.
Horrible.
And the Dominguez brothers, ranchers...
...were discovered in a gully with that look of horror on their faces...
...and no blood.
It's small consolation, Father, I admit...
...but as a scientist, I know where the effects are so similar...
...there must be a simple, logical cause.
I wonder how simple, Dr. Ramos, or how logical.
Father, what about that story about the demon bull?
That seems like a strange superstition.
Oh, the demon bull is a symbol of evil among many ancient civilizations.
About two days ago, all the workmen on the big Miraflores ranch...
...that's a huge estate on the other side of the foothills...
...decided to leave their work and come here to San Lorenzo.
Now, these men, usually frightened of nothing...
...said they wouldn't work there a day longer.
- They brought the tale of the demon bull.
- Has Miraflores been attacked also?
Cattle had been found dead in various areas of the ranch.
They hadn't been rounded up yet this year.
And for miles around, cowboys came upon one dead steer after another.
One of them had heard the tale of the demon bull of the Maricopa.
Now, gentlemen, I do not believe it, but it is as good an explanation as any other one.
Well, I'd like to think that our research up here might be of some help.
As do I, but this is no time to begin.
I know you're exhausted from your journey and listening to me.
Tonight you'll stay here, and maybe in the morning, things won't seem so mysterious.
Indeed, I hope so.
Here we are isolated, almost cut off from civilization...
...having lost family or friends to something absolutely unknown.
We could be in another world.
- Good night, Father.
- Good night.
Thank you for everything, Father.
- We really appreciate it.
- That's all right.
See you later this afternoon.
Dr. Ramos, Dr. Scott...
...I will ask you one more time not to begin this unnecessary expedition.
Major Cosio, we have answered all your questions.
- I don't see how we can be of any service.
- No, I don't require you for my work here.
I only know that if you start for that crater and find yourself in any difficulties...
...men who are much more badly needed here will have to go find you.
I'm sorry.
So that's why you must come back safely, and before sundown...
...with all the answers to your questions and mine.
Now you've got me.
What do you say, doc? Shall we try around over that side, or over here?
Neither one of them looks exactly like a Pan-American highway.
Everyone's always said that the best fissures are on the eastern slope.
You can see the lava there.
Maybe we can get close enough to get some pictures and plan our best approach.
You see a trail up around those rocks?
I don't know about that, but I've found something a lot more interesting.
- So?
- So?
Sí, sí, señor. Here, have a look.
It'll do you more good than that bottled water.
Ah, yes. Now I see him.
Doc, you haven't got that thing in focus.
They're focused...
...and it's a handsome horse, and I'd like to get started.
Horse?
There was a girl on that horse!
Come on, we've gotta get started and find her.
Now, don't move too much.
I said don't move.
We've got to find out if you're all right first.
Oh, I'm all right, really.
Except I could have been more graceful if I'd known spectators were around.
- Don't worry about that.
- Gently, now.
No broken bones, señorita? No sharp pains?
No, really, I'm all right.
I've fallen off Lucero before.
Not for many years, but...
I really can ride, gentlemen.
I'm Teresa Alvarez, of Miraflores.
Hank Scott.
Dr. Arturo Ramos.
The luck of the Alvarez. Tumble off a horse and land right next to a doctor.
Doctors of geology. We operate only with little hammers on rocks.
How about the horse?
I saw him gallop off.
Oh, don't bother.
Lucero always goes back to Miraflores...
...but, the saddle, I don't know...
- I'll get it.
- You're very kind.
- No bother at all.
- Do you happen to have a canteen?
- Oh, sure. Right on the jeep. Come on.
- There's a mirror you can use.
- Great.
Well, we'll be here several weeks at least.
We're conducting a sort of preliminary survey...
...and then the other boys will join us here next month.
You make it sound like a very intriguing occupation.
Oh, it is. You meet such interesting volcanoes.
Hey, Hank!
Thank you, doctor.
I ought to thank you.
I found this near the saddle.
- Oh, is that good?
- I'll say it is. It's obsidian.
That's lava that's cooled.
Well, I wouldn't know.
Cattle, yes, but rocks...
- Could I ask another favor of you?
- Well, sure.
Would you mind taking me back to San Lorenzo?
- Be glad to.
- Thank you.
I must get there today.
The telephone isn't working, and I have to hire some riders to help with my cattle.
That old volcano is really causing a lot of trouble this time.
Yeah, we heard in the village about your cowboys.
Well, if I lose my cattle, I lose everything.
- How are things in San Lorenzo?
- Oh, so-so.
I don't know what's gotten into my vaqueros at Miraflores.
So there was an earthquake...
...and the cattle started eating some poisonous weed we haven't learned of yet.
Is that any reason to act like frightened children?
I don't think it's just a poisonous plant, señorita.
You don't grow them that can push in the side of a building and wreck a car.
Oh, don't forget. You've promised to use Miraflores as your headquarters.
It will be a great convenience, señorita.
- Then we'll meet later?
- Right.
Chamoco, Felipe, Jose.
All of you.
Let me ask you this.
If your patron, my father, were alive today...
...would you be frightened of sounds in the night and run like children to the village?
- Señorita Teresa, I understand you need us.
- I say only this, muchachos.
I have known you all for all my life.
We have always worked together.
- Many of you were born at Miraflores.
- That's right.
If you don't wish to return just to help me save my cattle for me...
...then return to save Miraflores.
- We'll return.
- Gracias.
Dr. Ramos. Dr. Scott.
- Major Cosio wants to see you.
- Where is he?
- In the laboratory with Dr. Delacruz.
- Laboratory?
You'd be surprised at the experiments that go on there.
- Where is it?
- This way.
Doctor, is that the patrolman?
Yes, Sergeant Vega...
...who lived doing his duty and who may perform a greater one now.
Please.
Well?
Looked like subcutaneous cells that had just burst or run rampant.
My analysis also, Dr. Scott.
Not from any poison I can identify with this equipment.
Lopez, your help again, please.
In this, pure alcohol.
In this, distilled water.
In this, tequila.
In this, water with so much salt.
- You think it is a poison, then?
- I do.
Not a chemical poison, doctor?
No, but I believe for many reasons that this is an organic poison.
I have had a little experience with them:
The venoms of the snakes, the wasps, the spiders.
But I will prepare the slides and the specimens...
...and take them to a man in Mexico City who will be sure to know.
- Velasco?
- You know Velasco?
Who doesn't, doctor?
Well, as you say, if it's an organic poison...
...anything from nature, the great Velasco will identify it.
You said for many reasons.
What other reasons?
Well, there was only one wound. Here.
But no blood.
Then the situation of the tissues, the strange bacteria...
...bacteria I think, found in the soil samples near the footprints.
- Footprints?
- Footprints?
You are amazed.
Where something knocks down dwellings, flattens corn fields...
...it would be amazing if there were no footprints.
I never saw a moulage of a print this size.
Whatever it is, my friends...
...I don't believe anyone has ever seen a foot, a claw this size...
...except those poor unfortunates who wish they never had.
- One question, doctor.
- I hope I can answer it.
Well, the alcohol, the distilled water, the salt solution, I can understand that...
...but what's the tequila for?
Well, in your country,
I believe you call it a coffee break.
- There's the hacienda.
- Hey, that really looks like quite a place.
It looks like you were pretty lucky.
That thing really came close.
Yes. We were blessed that it didn't go any further...
...or our plantation would have been ruined like the rest of the land.
Señorita, thank heaven you're safe.
When Lucero came back to the stables without you, I began to search the hills.
Oh, Pio, I'd already been found by someone else.
This is Dr. Scott and Dr. Ramos.
- This is my foreman, Pio.
- Hi, Pio.
This way.
Not only comfortable, but cool too.
Yes, sometimes I think being cool is by far the most important on days like this.
Well, I know you'll want showers.
Florentina, show Dr. Ramos to the Blue Room.
Sí, señorita.
And Juanito, you show Dr. Scott to the left wing.
I'll take care of them.
Well, I'll see you later, and you can tell me all about your expedition.
Not bad, doc.
For half a day's work, Chamoco, not bad.
- Tell the boys.
- Yes, Pio, yes.
We get them all brought in by Thursday.
Why put on such a face?
We will do it if I have to stay in the saddle without sleep myself.
Pio, don't you understand?
Can't you see the cattle know that something evil is carried in the wind.
- Let us wait, Pio.
- Old women, Chamoco.
Now let us have a good supper and forget these superstitions.
Would you like some brandy, sir?
- Yes, thank you.
- Just a minute.
Juanito, hurry with the brandy.
- Would you like some too?
- Please.
I'll take care of them.
Muchas gracias.
May I make a complaint, Teresa?
Oh, I'm sorry. What was not done suitably?
Well, that's just it.
Everything was done beautifully.
You know, you're making it very difficult to think about settling down to work.
- Well, is that so bad?
- That all depends.
It might be very bad if I stopped thinking about work altogether...
...and just started concentrating on pleasure.
Hank, those volcanoes have been there for hundreds of years.
I'm sure they wouldn't mind waiting just a little longer.
I didn't expect you two to be discussing volcanoes.
I've got something to show you.
I noticed it last night at the village.
See anything? Hold it up against the light.
That's fantastic, doc.
Why, there's a scorpion trapped in there.
I think so. A few hundred years old, but there he is.
I wanted to show it to you before I broke it open.
Alive!
Lmpossible! Juanito, bring a jar.
- Life enduring for centuries like this.
- And under all that heat!
Velasco will certainly be interested in this.
Here, Juanito.
Pardon me, señores.
Do you like to keep scorpions?
I know a place where there are millions.
Not like this one, Juanito.
Pancho.
Pancho, if you don't know how to behave,
I have to send you out.
I want a magnifying glass to watch this little monster.
I could throw this scorpion out the window, and we'd really be alone.
It's simpler than that.
Why don't we go outside?
Why don't we?
Oh, excuse me, the line's been fixed.
- Hello. Hello.
- Hacienda Miraflores? Just testing the line.
- Oh, is the line all fixed?
- All clear, ma'am.
Miraflores was the last one, señora.
- Gaetano!
- What?
What's under the bridge?
No, in the arroyo!
Hank, come here.
Listen to this.
Hello. Hello.
- Hello, what's wrong?
- Look out!
Run, Gaetano. Get to the truck.
- Where's the arroyo bridge?
- I'll show you.
Pancho, what's happening to you tonight? Keep quiet.
Doc, we have to go to the bridge.
There's some trouble.
And you be a good boy.
Come back here! Pancho!
Pancho, come back here.
Pancho! Pancho! Pancho, come back here!
Pancho, what's the matter with you tonight?
Pancho, come back!
I'll get you.
Señorita.
- What's wrong with the cattle, Pio?
- I cannot say.
- Help, Mr. Hank!
- That's Juanito.
Run, Juanito!
Give me your gun. Call for help.
- It's a gigantic scorpion.
- Where is Juanito?
He's safe.
Operator. Operator. Operator!
Please, hurry, operator!
- I shot at that thing a dozen times.
- Must be after the cattle.
- Mr. Hank.
- Juanito, come on, quick.
Teresa, Florentina, come on into the jeep. Quick.
- Dr. Velasco.
- Dr. Ramos, I hoped I'd find you here.
This is fantastic.
- Dr. Velasco...
- Thank God, Father.
We thought you were all dead.
This is all that remains.
Even the animals.
I cannot speak of this night.
Eaten. Devoured.
I have been sent here in charge of emergency arrangements.
- All that are left will be moved to safety.
- Certainly.
Tell everyone to be ready to leave San Lorenzo.
Father, they may only take what they can carry in their arms.
- Very well.
- Where is the laboratory?
It's over there.
As soon as I received the samples,
I identified the poison...
...as that of a scorpion, but I had no concept of the creature's size...
...until I saw this.
And this.
This specimen found by Dr. Ramos...
...is of a species thought to be extinct since the Triassian era.
We have known it in a fossil state, but never alive.
Now from the bowels of the earth, it has come forth again to plague the earth.
What can we do? I emptied the machine gun at one of them.
I beg of you all, not to lose your head...
...in any sense of the word. But we have a few advantages against this enemy.
First, they come out to eat only at night.
Thus we have the daylight hours to try to find and destroy them.
Secondly, they are somewhat slow and lethargic...
...until inflamed by the smell of blood.
- I still ask one question, sir.
- Yes?
- What weapon do you intend to use?
- Gas. Poison gas.
It has been proved effective against normal species.
Let us pray it works against the Scorpionida rex.
If it does not...
...may God help all of you.
- Be ready at dawn.
- Is that all of them, lieutenant?
I want to do what I can too.
Señorita Alvarez,
I understand your emotions.
Believe me,
I'm not trying to be emotional.
- I wouldn't ask if I couldn't help.
- You don't know the hardships.
Dr. Velasco, Major Cosio, I know this area like the palm of my hand...
...better than any man here.
I'm a good shot.
You said yourself, you needed all the help you could get.
Señorita Alvarez, I think you have found yourself a job.
Gentlemen...
...Major Cosio and I are planning this.
Note where the various incidents have occurred.
I want to go with you.
I want to do a job.
Don't worry, Juanito.
We'll get together again.
That's a promise.
See if you can find my boots for me, will you?
I know where they are.
- Here they are.
- Oh, good.
They are very, very fine boots.
You kind of like those, huh?
Tell you what, Juanito...
...when you get to be a big man,
I'll get you a pair just like these.
- I thank you, Mr. Hank.
- You like that, huh?
I know how to ride very good.
I know how to shoot very good.
I'm 7 and 1/2 years old.
That's almost a half a man.
"A half a man"?
Oh, Juanito, you know sometimes even a half a man...
...has a lot of different jobs to do.
The most important job for you to do is to take care of your grandmother.
She can take care of herself.
I know, but you've got plenty of time to do more exciting things.
And you. You be very careful and don't get hurt, won't you?
Don't worry, I promise.
And a full man never break his promise.
Okay.
Oh, I don't see a thing, Dr. Velasco.
Might as well go on.
All right.
Major.
- Yes.
- Tell your captain to hold...
...all the heavy equipment until we call for it.
Okay, doctor.
- Here it is, a great big opening.
- I guess he found it, Dr. Velasco.
Yes.
Look, there's something wrong with his horse. He's falling in!
Let's hurry up there, Hank.
Come on, let's go.
We must get down to the lower level.
This crevice is new. It must have opened during one of the earthquakes.
- This looks like a job for us, doc.
- Of course.
No chance for Mendoza?
How deep do you say it is?
Doc and I have been down many a cave...
...but there's no way of really telling until you actually hit bottom.
The only way we can find out is to go down there ourselves.
- What do you say, doc?
- Right.
Will that poisonous gas work in a crevice this big?
I could not anticipate such a void as this.
It may dissipate.
Major, I think you better bring all your heavy equipment up here:
Crane, tanks and all.
Captain, bring the crane and all the heavy equipment.
You want my men to go down there?
- It's suicide.
- Don't worry about it.
Doc and I haven't had a decent elevator ride in a long time.
Hank, please, no.
- What are you doing here?
- I'm a stowaway.
Juanito, do me a favor, will you, and just stay out of the way?
- Yes, Mr. Hank.
- Good.
And just sit in the jeep like a big boy, okay?
- Put these in the cage.
- Why the birds, professor?
If the birds stop singing, that means there's poison gas in the cave.
Hank, you don't have to do it.
Neither of you. It's not your responsibility.
Whose responsibility is it?
The police, the army, the people who live here.
Now, look, doc and I know more about caves than anyone else here.
- Why did you do that?
- Maybe I just wanted to see what you'd do.
- What did I do?
- You did all right.
Señorita...
...you can help keep the log of the descent.
How many meters down, the reports which are made...
Sure, keep yourself busy. That's my theory.
Oh, and don't forget to take care of little Juanito.
All right, take it down.
Doc, look down there.
Stop. Stop the cage a minute.
Stop.
Hank, are you all right?
It's the head of a scorpion in the wall.
Hold on a second.
- Okay, I got a picture of it. Lower on.
- All right, lower them down.
We've just hit bottom.
We're in a huge cavern.
I've never seen a cave so big in my life.
- Can you see any signs of Mendoza?
- No, not from here.
We'll take a look around.
- Well, the birds seem all right.
- Yeah.
Are you there, Hank?
Hank, answer.
Are you there, Hank?
Dr. Ramos. Dr. Ramos.
Hello. Hello.
Hello.
- Hello.
- Yes.
Mendoza's dead.
- We just saw a worm 30 feet long.
- Hank, please come up.
- Hank.
- No, we wanna look around a little more.
Hey, doc.
Over here.
- There must be a nest full of them.
- Yeah.
- It doesn't even penetrate it.
- Try another one.
No, wait.
That must be the granddaddy of them all.
That's how they kill each other, that spot in the throat.
That must be it.
Mr. Hank!
Help! Help!
Help!
Help!
Mr. Hank!
- It's Juanito.
- Help!
Help.
Mr. Hank, help!
Help!
Mr. Hank!
Stay back in the cave, Juanito.
All right. Come on, Juanito.
I told you to stay in the jeep.
What are you doing down here?
- I came to help you.
- To help us.
Oh, come on.
Mr. Hank. Mr. Hank, look.
- What's causing that?
- Dr. Ramos, are you there?
Are you there? Are you there, Dr. Ramos?
Hank, answer me.
- Block the crane, or it'll be pulled in.
- Throw some blocks under that crane.
There goes our cage, gas tanks, everything.
There's no weight on the cable.
Oh, no.
Take the cable, and send it back down as fast as you can.
Bring it in slow.
- Maybe they are on it.
- Oh, pull it up. Please.
Keep bringing it in.
- Keep going, doc.
- Hang on, doc. You can make it.
- Keep going.
- Come on, hold on.
- What happened to Hank?
- Hank and Juanito are down there.
- Get a loop on the cable. Send it, quick.
- Make a loop on the cable.
Oh, Juanito.
Oh, Juanito, why did you do it?
I tried to help them.
It'll be dark in an hour, and those scorpions'll come out again.
- You couldn't use the gas?
- No, we lost it in the molten lava.
There must be 50 of those things down there.
Can't we close and seal that opening with dynamite?
You have no idea as to the size of that place. Wait till you see these pictures.
I want those pictures.
I even hoped to get a specimen.
Why, you couldn't get one of those things out even with this crane.
Major, we must try to seal it shut with an explosion. We must try before nightfall.
I thought you said scorpions could go for months without food.
The giants don't last long. They eat their own weight every three or four days.
But suppose they find another way?
Those passages down there.
This is the only place they have appeared.
This probably is their only exit from the cavern.
- Major.
- Yes, doctor.
Let's close it.
Ready?
Let her go.
I guess that does it.
Midnight, and everyone goes back to what he was before.
This isn't the end of anything, not for us. It's the beginning.
Hank, all of us have done our work now...
...and thank heaven it can be done without any more tragedy.
You have your survey of the volcanoes to make.
Well, that's fine.
I'll be home every night for dinner.
I have to leave at once.
I should have left for the States two months ago to buy cattle for the herd.
- You'll be in Mexico City for a week first?
- Yes.
Then I'll finish up my work here with doc.
I'll meet you there, and you can show me the town.
Oh, but even if we do have, what, a day, two days...?
I don't want to settle for just two days, Hank.
I don't want just two days either.
I don't fool people.
I don't want them to fool me either.
I'm not, darling.
I like you very much indeed.
And I want you very much.
- Dr. Scott.
- Hello, I can hardly hear you.
This is Dr. Velasco.
Oh, Dr. Velasco. How are you, sir?
Well, we're just getting started, finally.
Yeah, right now.
I regret to have to complicate the plans you and Dr. Ramos have made for so long...
...but some of my colleagues here in Mexico are very anxious to talk to you both at once.
I don't really think there's anything we can add to what you already know, Dr. Velasco.
I'm with the director of civilian defense and high army officers right now, Hank.
It is imperative you both return here at once to complete your report.
I don't like to say that you can be ordered.
What's the trouble?
Everything is under control, isn't it?
There's no cause for alarm, not at all.
But a request for cooperation has been made by...
By a good neighbor of the South, and we feel that...
Well, if you put it like that...
Look, we've already postponed the trip five times. I guess once more won't matter.
What? Oh, a plane?
Yeah, sure, that would help a lot.
Oh, Dr. Velasco, do you suppose there'd be room for three on that plane?
Of course there will.
All right, sir. Yes, sir, I understand.
Right, see you then.
- Did he suspect?
- No, I don't think so.
- He assumes that the danger is over.
- That's fine.
You seemed willing to postpone our trip...
...once you learned Teresa could ride on the plane.
Well, at least it was some sort of an inducement.
My friend, remember, this is not the balcony of the neighborhood movie theater.
This is Mexico. When a man shows as much attention to a girl as you have...
...suddenly, he's in a cathedral and wondering how he got there.
So? What have you got against marriage?
I try to remember what my father told me one time.
He said, "Arturo, every child in the world is born single.
Please try to profit more than
I did by the experience."
- Dr. Ramos, Dr. Scott.
- Yes?
I am Victor Esteban. Dr. Velasco has asked me to take you to him at once.
Right away?
But what about Señorita Alvarez?
I have orders to take her wherever she wishes.
But you gentlemen must then accompany me to the university.
All right.
Follow me, please.
Gentlemen, we are grateful that you have given up your own plans to help us.
And we must apologize for bringing you here under false pretenses.
It is not a neighboring country which needs your help. It is our government.
Señor Moreno, of course there's always a possible danger again.
Twenty years from now, another earthquake.
It is not a potential danger, gentlemen.
We feel it is all too real, and not 20 years from now. Perhaps in less than a month.
- You better fill us in from the beginning.
- Yes, of course.
I'm in charge of an aerial mapping project for our government.
Recently our planes were photographing the area near San Lorenzo.
Gentlemen, perhaps if you would sit down and take a look.
Turn off the lights.
No. Not near the city.
It is one of them.
Now you're convinced our fears are justified?
I don't like to disagree...
...but merely because a dead scorpion was found coming to the surface...
...doesn't mean we didn't destroy them all when we dynamited.
This scorpion may be one that...
Excuse me, sir. Naturally, the same thought had occurred to us.
We rechecked our photographs.
On the 21 st, two days after the earthquake, the scorpion was not there.
He was not there until the day after you exploded the dynamite.
And you thought you destroyed the scorpions.
It is obvious at least one survived that explosion...
...and almost succeeded in reaching the surface.
Switch the lights on.
And gentlemen, we must proceed as if there are more of them left.
Exactly where is this area where it was photographed?
Southwest of the volcano.
Almost directly across from the fissure where you and Dr. Scott descended.
You will see, here, is the fissure.
This is San Lorenzo.
It was here, exactly here, that the photograph was taken.
I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill.
Dr. Velasco knows how that mountain went when we blew it up.
Nothing could live under those tons of rock.
- Not if they were under the rocks.
- I don't follow you.
From your description, what Dr. Velasco told us...
...it is obvious that the cavern into which you two men descended...
...is part of Chamilpa Caves...
...huge tunnels that run under the earth at depths up to five miles...
...many of which have been mapped in the region around Mexico City.
Some are flooded, parts of the underground lakes.
Yes, I've heard of them.
Here they are. Notice how this large fissure here...
...is directly above this arm of the system.
This large pocket, here, is exactly the place where you took your photographs.
Now, also note that here...
...where the scorpion was photographed from the air...
...is also part of the connecting system.
The scorpions could have fled underground to one of many underground shelters.
As you thought at the time could happen, Hank.
What is that long arm there?
That is a cavern which extends southward to within 20 miles of Mexico City...
...there, where it lies under the railroad.
This is what we wonder. How many of the scorpions might have decided to rush here?
And when will they decide to come to the surface after blood?
So that is why we brought you here.
The day after tomorrow, we want you to address a group...
...of scientific and military experts so that we may plan for any emergency.
What kind of rifles were you using?
How powerful?
The cartridges I was using are supposed to penetrate two inches of steel.
But they didn't stop the scorpions!
How do they kill each other?
The throat. There's a small spot right here that has no armor. That's its weak point.
When they attack each other, they have poison to inject into their enemy's throat.
- Can you duplicate the poison?
- Nope. Not without a giant scorpion.
What we need is something that'll penetrate that small area exactly...
...and then send some sort of poison into the circulatory systems.
What it could be, I have no idea.
We're all in the same dilemma.
With the meeting on Friday,
I'm sure we'll reach a solution.
Gentlemen, I do not have to tell you that...
...everything we have discussed here is absolutely secret.
This is a city of four million people.
If word of this leaks out...
...the panic of the population would be worse than the scorpions.
Nice dress, nice girl.
Well, thank you.
I'm glad you could see me in something besides the clothes I wear at the ranch...
...for two days at least.
- So am I.
Hank, what's the meeting on Friday about?
Oh, some geophysical conference
Dr. Velasco roped us in on. Cigarette?
Not right now.
After you finish that, where am I taking you for dinner?
Hank, it's only 9:00.
That's what I mean.
Do you realize this is Mexico City?
And no one has dinner before 11:00 at night. Sometimes midnight.
Why, it's practically afternoon right now.
Lots of men are just leaving their offices.
Am I going to have trouble with you.
Well, you work on it, teacher.
I think you can solve me.
Nice work.
Caviar. Aren't you overdoing it a bit, Hank?
Well, I've gotta make an impression on you in 48 hours that'll last for two months.
Don't you like caviar?
Oh, I love it, but I must say I could never understand why it's so expensive.
Well, it's a whole year's work for a sturgeon.
It's been wonderful these past two days. I wish they'd never end.
They don't have to.
For a while, they do.
I wish you'd change your mind.
You don't have to go away.
That volcano can wait.
No, you'll get through with your speech tomorrow and your silly expedition...
...and I'll do everything I have to do.
When we come back we won't have a worry in the world.
We interrupt this program to bring you a news bulletin.
The train from Monterrey was derailed outside of Mexico City.
Early reports indicate an appalling loss of life.
Eyewitness accounts state that monstrous scorpions...
...have swarmed around the wreckage.
One moment, please, we're trying to get through to the emergency area.
Reports to this moment from available hospital and emergency field units...
...indicate many of the victims are so badly injured there is little hope of their survival.
All ambulances, cars, trucks and other vehicles...
...have been commandeered by the authorities in this emergency.
We've received a report from the scene confirming that 129 persons...
...are killed and hundreds missing.
Survivors report...
...a giant black scorpion killed the smaller scorpions and is headed for Mexico City.
We were trying to find you.
- What can we do?
- You can help us soon enough.
We're not sure how many of them are left, but the largest may be the only one.
With the lust for blood after the wreck, the scorpions went mad.
The largest killed four of them, and may have killed the rest of them.
- Where is the scorpion?
- We lost it in the hills 10 miles out of town.
But it's approaching the northwest area of the capital.
Yes. Yes.
It has been seen. Let's go.
Attention. Attention.
The city is under martial law.
All inhabitants living north of Tacubaya and west of Guadalupe must leave their homes.
Follow the orders of the police.
Listen, darling, you get in that building and stay there!
The scorpion has not reached the city.
It has been verified that only one giant black scorpion is alive.
The public is warned that the city will have a blackout.
A defense ring is being set up surrounding the area where it was seen.
Authorities are taking all protective measures. Observe safety precautions.
Protect your homes from fire hazards.
Sections of the community are in a state of panic...
...adding to the burden of the authorities and threatening...
...to disrupt communications vital to the defense of the city.
If rifles and cannon won't stop it...
- Major Cosio here.
- Yes.
We have narrowed the ring one mile along
Insurgentes. Operation is proceeding.
That's fine. Have Major Ortega meet us in front of the stadium with the weapon.
Major Ortega, Major Ortega.
Meet us in front of the stadium with the weapon and generator.
With what kind of weapon?
I hope it is a weapon.
Just now it is only a prayer.
- Dr. Velasco?
- Yes?
Tell Col. Sanchez to move the heavy equipment into the stadium.
Col. Sanchez, Col. Sanchez.
Dr. Velasco here.
Move all the heavy equipment into the stadium right away.
The projectile enters the throat.
If I'm lucky, Dr. Velasco, but I have never used a weapon like this before.
Attached to the projectile is the copper wire...
...then the insulated wire which leads to the cable and the generator.
It should give 600,000 volts.
- This meat should bring him in here.
- I hope so.
It's about the only way we can corner it.
You might need more than one shot, major.
- Señor Moreno.
- Yes, yes.
The scorpion is following the meat wagon.
There it is.
The throat, major. Remember, the white area on the throat.
The head comes back just before it strikes.
Right.
You missed!
I won't miss this time!
Turn it off! Turn it off!
Turn the switch on!
Turn it off!
Now we can secure some of the actual poison from the Scorpionida rex...
...analyze it and create a simple protection against them if ever again...
- Hank, Velasco wants to...
- Gentlemen, we must not waste any time.
If we could all meet tomorrow at my laboratory for a recapitulation.
Hank, Señorita Alvarez!
We have not yet finished.
Neither have we.
[Rip by Talorg]
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
This is KRKR-TV.
And now for the latest news.
Early tonight the captain of a Swedish icebreaker in the Barents Sea...
...reported seeing a strange red fireball come out of the sky.
Says the captain:
"It hovered above my ship for about a minute...
...and then headed south by southwest. "
Unquote.
Radio Cairo reports a herd of camels stampeded by a comet-like object...
...streaking southwest across the Sahara.
And in Cape Town, Africa, a Boer, no doubt...
...reports a similar flash across the sky.
And still one more, ladies and gentlemen.
A farmer in Auckland, New Zealand reported the strange glowing object...
...this time moving northeast.
Now, let's see.
Barents Sea.
Cairo.
Auckland.
Considering the time table of these reports...
...the stranger from space should be over our California desert in a matter of minutes.
No, no!
Harry! Harry help me!
Harry, help me!
Harry...
Harry, what will your wife say?
She'll say plenty, tonight anyhow.
Did you see the way she tore out of here in that big car of hers?
She only caught us nodding to each other.
She'll make up for all the things she hasn't caught us doing.
I'm so fed up.
I never should have agreed to go back to her once we were separated.
- Why did you?
- You know why.
I couldn't pry one nickel out of her.
That community-property routine only works for women.
A man hasn't got a chance.
Unless the wife dies.
I didn't say anything.
You were thinking it.
Not the same thing.
Didn't you say she was in the nut house for a while?
A private sanitarium.
What's the difference?
She was off her rocker, wasn't she?
I suppose so.
Probably got some fancy name for it.
Mostly she'd have these violent headaches.
And then she'd get falling-down drunk.
Still has them to this day.
What are you getting at?
Oh, come on, now, Harry.
Let's not be naive.
You've made a good start, now follow through.
- She's on the brink and you know it.
- I don't know it.
This Dr. Cushing seems to be helping her a lot.
She's tapering off on the bottle too.
Hardly took a drink all evening, you saw her.
All she needs is a little help.
Play the husband right to the end.
Once she's in the booby hatch, throw the key away.
That will put you in the driver's seat.
You'd make a wild driver, Harry.
With 50 million bucks.
Harry!
Harry!
Harry, help me!
Mrs. Archer. Mrs. Archer, what's the matter?
Here, somebody give me a hand.
We'll take her into the office.
Hey, chief!
Chief.
- Mrs. Archer.
- Harry.
Go on, folks, go on.
Go on, nothing you can do around here.
Go find Harry while I take care of Mrs. Archer.
- All right, let's break it up.
- Now, come on, Mrs. Archer.
Come on and sit down in the car.
I'll send somebody for some black coffee.
Black coffee?
You think I'm drunk, don't you?
- All of you! I'm not drunk, I'm not!
- Now, Mrs. Archer.
- You've got to believe me.
- Please...
It was right in the middle of the highway,
30 feet tall.
- It lit up the sky.
- I know that.
You don't believe me, do you?
Any of you.
I'll believe you, Mrs. Archer.
I'll believe you, just be calm.
Now, come on and sit down in the car.
Come on, take it easy and tell me all about it, slowly.
Hey, Mr. Archer.
Mr. Archer.
What is it, Charlie?
Oh, all right, I get the message.
She's over at the sheriff's office.
She's in kind of bad shape.
She's pretty hysterical.
You couldn't find me tonight, Charlie.
I took a cab home.
Sure, sure, I get it, Mr. Archer.
Thanks a lot.
So... So she's tapering off, eh?
Hardly took a drink all evening.
Must have been a bottle in the car,
I don't know.
- Did you find Mr. Archer?
- He took a cab home, chief.
Charlie, go get the riot gun.
We're taking a ride in the desert with Mrs. Archer.
Right.
Why the heavy artillery, chief?
There's a flying satellite...
...and a 30-foot giant a few miles out on 66.
A 30-foot giant?
Oh, no.
Hey, look. There it is.
Mrs. Archer's car, I mean, chief.
Where did you see it, Mrs. Archer?
You can think what you like.
It was right there in the middle of the road.
Yes, ma'am.
Come on, Charlie, let's look around.
What's up?
She off her rocker or something?
Don't look back, but as long as she's paying most of the taxes around here...
...we play along with her.
Let's spread out here.
You see anything, chief?
Come on.
Not a thing, Mrs. Archer.
No prints of any kind either.
Why would there be? I told you everything happened on the roadway.
I was standing right here.
It seemed to be reaching for my diamond.
That's another thing
I've been wanting to tell you, Mrs. Archer.
That diamond you're wearing would tempt the devil himself.
There are a lot of drifters in the desert...
...who'd commit murder for a well-cut piece of glass.
In other words, you're suggesting what I saw tonight was some desert tramp.
You're saying that, ma'am.
I'm only suggesting that you be more careful with that diamond.
I didn't run all the way to town just for a lecture, sheriff.
We'll be glad to escort you home,
Mrs. Archer.
No, thanks.
Boy, she's tearing out of here like she was heading for the moon.
Poor, mixed-up Mrs. Archer.
I feel kind of sorry for her.
Well, I feel a lot sorrier for her husband...
...if she catches him with that
Honey Parker he's got stashed at the hotel.
- What a doll.
- Yeah.
Well, come on, Charlie.
It's past midnight.
Town can't afford to be paying us overtime.
Good evening, Mrs. Archer.
Is there anything I can do for you,
Mrs. Archer?
Yeah.
Beat it out of here.
Don't talk to Jess like that.
Maybe you should marry Jess and hire me for the butler.
Hey. I said out.
You can go, Jess.
Yes, ma'am.
And as far as I'm concerned, you can go too.
Go back to Tony's and that woman you were mooning about.
Knock it off, will you?
Now, you pulled a boner tonight, and you know it.
Why, leaving me stranded at Tony's without a ride.
I wasn't in the mood for an argument in front of all those people.
I didn't feel like sitting there and watching you flirt...
...with that red-headed wench you call Honey.
For heaven's sake, Nancy.
Why, I hardly nodded to the girl.
Now, you listen to me, Harry.
I won't stand for any more of your two-timing.
You keep away from that girl in that hotel, you hear?
Your backdoor romancing split us up once already.
The next time there won't be any reconciliation.
You know, you're gonna flip your lid just one time too many with me, Nancy.
And you're gonna make one too many passes at some other woman.
My husband.
My gigolo, that's what you are.
You're a miserable parasite.
You're just after my money.
I was rid of you once.
Why did I take you back?
Why, why?
Why did you, Nancy?
Why?
Because I love you, Harry.
Why am I always fighting with you when I love you so?
I'm sorry.
But if you'd only show me once that you really cared...
...I'd do anything.
What's wrong with us, Harry?
I don't know.
Maybe it's me. Maybe I'm...
Harry, I've got to tell you something.
Only please don't make fun of me.
First, listen to the whole story.
Tonight while I was driving home...
You're going to think I'm crazy.
No, no. Go on, Nancy.
Harry, I saw a satellite tonight.
Oh, is that all?
You know, everyone's seeing satellites these days.
Not like this.
It came out of the sky and landed in the middle of the highway.
Harry, I almost hit it.
And a man, a giant of a man came out of it.
I could feel his hands at my throat.
I think he was after my diamond.
Well, I see you still have the diamond.
I ran in the desert, that's why I'm such a mess.
I told the sheriff and he didn't believe me.
I saw the look on his face.
He thought I was drinking.
Harry, you know I wasn't drinking tonight.
Oh, please, Harry.
You believe me, don't you?
Of course I do, sweetheart.
Now, you've had a terrible night.
I think you need some rest.
Now, it's late. Come on.
I'm gonna put you to bed and we'll go through this tomorrow.
Why can't you be nice like this all the time, Harry?
There.
Oh, now, I never meant to be mean to you, Nancy.
Any more than I wanted you to stay in that sanitarium...
...you know?
Well...
...things seem to worry you lately.
You know, like before.
I don't know.
Maybe it's my fault, huh?
For not making things easier for you.
Maybe it would be better if we separated again.
Now, I wouldn't want to cause another breakdown in your health.
Oh, Harry, I couldn't stand that.
I need you.
Oh, if you only knew how much.
You're all I have, Harry.
There you go.
That's why I've always liked this place.
We could be so happy here.
Just the two of us, no more arguments.
Here, Nancy. This will make you sleep.
I don't wanna sleep.
I feel much better with you here.
No more arguments.
Water.
There you go.
That's the girl.
Feel better?
Don't leave me, Harry.
Harry.
I need you, all to myself.
Hi, Mr. Archer. I was...
I was just saying arrivederci.
I thought you'd be waiting for me at your hotel.
You know I don't like you hanging around here alone.
You're not jealous of that clown, are you?
It's too early to go to bed.
Anyways, I'm sick of that fleabag you call a hotel.
And I'm tired of waiting.
All I do is wait, wait, wait.
Maybe you won't have to wait as long as you think.
She's cracking up again.
She's seeing satellites and giants.
Not only told me about it, but she spread it all over town tonight.
- Even had the sheriff out looking for it.
- Charlie was telling me about it.
This could be it.
When Dr. Cushing hears about it, he'll have her committed right away.
He's in Baker. I'll call him tonight.
Well, that sounds more like it.
I don't think I could take much more of this setup.
Well, anytime you get to thinking that way...
...remember this.
The Star of India.
It's the most famous diamond in the world.
And you play your cards right and it'll all be yours.
Someday.
Let's call Dr. Cushing.
- What do you think, Dr. Cushing?
- She's not well, Harry.
She's suffering from mental exhaustion.
And her drinking doesn't help her any.
You did well to send for me.
Jess.
Now, give Mrs. Archer...
...one of those every four hours, and two at bedtime.
Keep her very quiet and no alcohol.
There's not much we can do for her until she gets some rest.
You needn't come out, Harry.
Jess will see me to the car.
Doctor.
About last night...
Oh, that satellite business?
Probably overworked imagination.
- You think she's having a relapse?
- Mentally?
Well, let's hope not.
I'm afraid it'd kill her if she ever had to go back to that sanitarium.
She needs to be near you, Harry.
She seems to get a great deal of consolation from you.
Now, be patient with her, my boy.
And with the right understanding on your part...
...I have high hopes for her eventual recovery.
Oh, I'll be in town for a few days.
If you need me, just call.
Well, my faithful husband, no less.
You finally decided to come home.
What's the matter, Harry?
Couldn't you stand the suspense any longer?
Couldn't you wait another minute for the psychiatrist's verdict?
What did he say, Harry?
Does he think I'm crazy too?
No one thinks you're crazy, Nancy.
How nice.
Then you believe me.
You believe I saw the satellite.
It's not the first time someone has seen a satellite.
Right in the road, with a giant in it?
Don't be so condescending, Harry.
I know what you're thinking.
I know why Dr. Cushing was here,
I know who called him.
I called him.
He's here for your own good, Nancy.
And I know where you spent the night last night too.
You seem to have a lot of information.
Well, I don't like being tailed in my own home.
Here, your giant friend may come looking for this.
Harry, wait. Where are you going?
Ask Jess.
Wouldn't you like something to eat?
The doctor said...
Oh, Jess, quit mincing around and leave me alone.
Yes, ma'am.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is KRKR-TV.
And now, more news of high fliers.
Nancy Archer, the former Nancy Fowler...
... Heiress to the Fowler millions and owner
of the fabulous Star of India diamond...
... Has joined that ever-expanding
international society of satellite-seers.
From the Archers' palatial
home-away-from-home comes a report...
... That Mrs. Archer has not only been seeing
a sociable satellite...
... But its inhabitant as well:
A 30-foot giant.
Was he pink with big ears and tusks?
Well, maybe Mrs. Archer...
... who has recently been feuding
with her husband, handsome Harry...
... Has finally found a man
from out of this world.
A man who could love her for herself.
Come, come, now, Mrs. Archer.
A man can ignore $ 1 million,
but 50?
That's too much to ask
even from the man in the moon.
What happened?
So I'm crazy? I'm seeing things, am I?
Jess, get the car.
I'm going out to the desert and find that thing.
And you're going with me.
Well, don't just stand there, go on.
You're being ridiculous, Nancy.
There's nothing out there.
You don't believe me.
Well, you're wrong. You're all wrong.
You're drunk, Nancy.
Why don't you try to sleep it off?
Not until I've proved it to myself and to you.
We'll drive on the side roads.
I have a strange feeling it's out there somewhere waiting for me.
I'm certain of it.
And if it isn't?
Then I'm crazy and should be committed.
The car's out in front, ma'am.
Jess, get the revolver.
What's the gun for?
We're going hunting, remember?
Let's go.
Nothing.
Just sand and space.
Well, seen enough?
Keep driving.
There. Stop the car, Harry, there it is.
I don't see a thing.
I saw it flash behind those hills.
All right, all right, I'll turn around.
Hurry.
Well, now we've combed all through these hills.
You saw it.
There's nothing out here.
Just emptiness.
Well, shall we drive on a little further?
I'm sorry, Harry.
I'm sorry.
That's it. I did see it.
I told you. I told you!
I was right. I was right. It's real.
- It's real!
- Nancy.
Nancy, come back here.
Come back here.
Let's get out of here. Nancy.
It's real. It's real.
- Nancy, get away from it.
- I'm not crazy. I did see it.
- It's a satellite.
- Come here.
- Harry, touch it. I did see it.
- Nancy, come here.
Hurry, Harry!
Harry, help me!
Harry! Help me!
Help me, Harry!
Harry, help me!
Harry!
What have you done with Mrs. Archer?
Get out of my way.
You're not leaving this room until you tell me what happened to her.
You aren't gonna get away with it.
Give me the sheriff's office.
Get dressed and packed, quick.
What's the matter?
No time for questions and answers now.
Here, we're getting out of here.
What did you do?
Rob the First National Bank?
Shut up and get moving. Come on.
All right, all right.
Nobody wants to get out of this dump worse than I do.
Hey. Those are the only clothes I've got.
You finished yet?
You just got here.
If you saw what I saw, you'd have jumped out of your skin to get moving.
Here, zip me.
- Come on, come on, come on.
- All right, all right.
- Where we going?
- Out of here, but fast.
You going some place?
Miss Parker is leaving town.
It's kind of sudden, ain't it?
The night clerk here didn't know anything about it.
Well, she... She does now.
I'm sorry, Mr. Archer, but Sheriff Dubbitt wants to see you in his office.
The both of you.
You're making a mistake, Charlie.
Let's go.
Let me see, now. You got three sixes...
...you got the queen of hearts, that's the heart run...
...so safest card in the deck.
Hey, what do you want that card for?
And that's a gin.
I don't wanna play anymore.
Getting daylight already.
The chief's always worrying about the taxpayers' money.
Yeah? Oh, hi, Mary.
No, darling,
I wasn't dancing at Tony's Club.
I was out picking up a couple of guests for the sheriff.
Yeah, he's out in the desert now with a posse looking for the...
Oh, they did, huh?
On the pool house?
What do you know about that?
Yeah. They found Mrs. Archer.
I don't know how she got there.
Hey, maybe by a helicopter, huh?
Yeah, all right, Mary.
Will you take any messages that come in?
Yeah, we're on our way right now.
Yeah. Bye, sweetie.
We'll take your wife's Imperial, right?
Yeah, right.
Imagine your wife was home all the time on top of the pool house, loaded.
How serious is it, Dr. Cushing?
Too early to tell. But we should get her to a hospital as soon as she's strong enough.
Those hours of exposure on the roof didn't help any.
Especially the way she was dressed.
It's not the exposure that worries me, it's those scratches on her throat.
That's Mr. Archer now.
And Honey.
I never would have thought it.
Better let me do the talking, Dr. Cushing.
What's wrong with Nancy?
What happened?
I'll ask the questions, Mr. Archer.
- Now, suppose you tell me what happened.
- I'm in no mood for games, sheriff.
I wouldn't go up there if I were you, Harry.
There's some possibility she may have been contaminated.
There's evidence of some kind of radiation.
Of course, we can't be sure.
Now, tell me what happened out there,
Mr. Archer.
- Out where?
- Jess told us.
You drove Mrs. Archer out into the desert last night with his gun.
You came back alone.
Now, what happened to Mrs. Archer...
...and what happened to the diamond she was wearing?
He's lying. I left the house alone.
Right after you, Dr. Cushing.
That's right.
Harry was with me all evening.
We were stepping out for air when your deputy stopped us.
Dr. Cushing, it's time for that injection you ordered.
Thank you, nurse, thank you.
I wouldn't have believed it, Harry.
I'm very disappointed.
- There seems to be a difference...
- Be careful with that, nurse.
Exactly 0.75 cc.
One way or another.
When Mrs. Archer regains consciousness, she'll corroborate me, Sheriff Dubbitt.
Well, where does that leave us?
Nowhere.
Just don't try to leave town for a while.
And that means you too, Miss Parker.
We have nothing to hide.
We'll be around.
Come on, Honey.
I'll drive you back into town.
According to Jess...
...Mr. Archer drove his wife out into the desert last night...
...and came home alone.
One thing you can be certain about,
Jess is absolutely trustworthy.
He's been with Nancy since she was a little girl.
I know he's telling the truth.
What's the matter?
Our necks are way out if Nancy comes to and talks.
There is a way out if you've got the nerve.
Try me.
The serum that private nurse is using in her hypodermic needle, I...
I heard the doctor tell her that an overdose would be fatal.
Money certainly brings out the best in you, doesn't it?
Have you got the nerve?
Read the morning papers.
Slide over and drive to town.
I've got things to do.
Doctor. Doctor Cushing.
Something's happened to Mrs. Archer.
- Something's happened to Mrs. Archer.
- Astounding growth.
Meat hooks.
- Four lengths of chain.
- The chains you were expecting are here.
Good. I'll tell Dr. Loeb at once.
Meat hooks, four lengths of chain...
...40 gallons of plasma...
...and an elephant syringe?
The chains are here.
Well, Heinrich, what do you make of it?
Fantastic.
I've made every test in the book.
There's no diagnosis.
Look at this slide.
Dermal connective tissue.
Filaria?
If only it were filaria.
We'd have something to go on.
A beginning.
There's not even streptococcal infection...
...to incite the inflammation of the lymph channels.
What could it be?
I don't know.
I just don't know.
We may find our answer when we operate.
Giantism can result from an overactive forward lobe...
...of the pituitary fossa, as you know.
Then you think surgery is indicated?
Except for that one thing.
The blue-green color around the scratches at her throat.
I would venture to say...
...it is some sort of radiation...
...which we in medicine have never touched upon.
Fortunately, the dose she received was not deadly.
Then you... You feel there is hope.
With surgery? Yes.
We'll have to have the husband's permission to operate, of course.
There is always hope as long as there is faith, Raymond.
I almost gave you up, baby.
I've been reading the papers.
I told you what happened on the phone.
We've got problems again.
That new doctor, Von Loeb, thinks he can help her.
Bring me a drink, will you?
What's the matter?
Your conscience bothering you, Harry?
You know, the trouble with us is we've both got the same disease.
Money.
And happy ways of spending it.
I've missed you.
Has she talked yet?
She's still in a coma.
They're looking for me now to give them permission to operate.
That's great. That's wonderful.
You just hide out and let her blow up like a balloon.
You can pull now, Heinrich.
Steady.
Give me a boost, Charlie.
- Nothing.
- Yeah, I could see that from here.
Almost.
There's a ladder over there.
Charlie.
- What is it?
- I don't know.
But whatever it is, it wasn't made by a Japanese gardener.
Go get Jess.
Tell him to get down here pronto.
Excuse me.
Jess. Sheriff Dubbitt wants to see you.
Right away.
I thought you two might like a cool...
Did you ever see anything like this around here before, Jess?
A giant footprint.
Maybe Mrs. Archer wasn't so...
I've been thinking the same thing myself.
Hey, look.
There's another one over there.
- Hey, look. There's another one.
- Charlie.
We've got to keep quiet about this thing or everybody will think we're nuts.
Be dark in a half-hour.
We'll follow these, see where they lead.
- We will?
- Mrs. Archer has a station wagon.
Good. Run my car into town and get the riot gun, Charlie.
Bring a couple of grenades and some tear gas and flashlights too.
- Tear gas? Grenades?
- We'll leave as soon as you get back.
You better plan on being up all night tonight.
We've gotta have somebody in the office in case Jess and I wanna get in touch.
Sure. You know,
I'd like to go with you, chief.
There will be no charge for overtime.
Come on, Jess.
There's still some daylight left.
Let's follow these things.
Excuse me, chief.
Bring it up.
Amazing.
Here.
We'd better walk the rest of the way.
There's a radio phone in the car.
Shouldn't we call for help?
No use yelling for outside interference until we see what we got.
Harry must have brought her out here and left her.
And then this...
This giant must have taken her home and put her on the pool-house roof.
Amazing.
Look.
My gun.
He emptied it before he ran.
At what?
Over here.
Look.
The Star of India.
Mrs. Archer was right.
The thing was after her diamond.
Diamonds everywhere. Different colors.
Must be used to power this thing in some way.
Let's take this one and get out of here.
Charlie. Charlie.
The radio's shot too.
We might as well start walking.
We'll come back for all this stuff later.
It's gonna be a long walk.
I've known Nancy since she was born.
In those days, she was a beautiful child.
Fresh, young, full of the joys of life.
But in the last few years, after her marriage, she changed.
Her health seemed to rise and fall with the tide of her emotions.
A very sad case.
A case not infrequent in this supersonic age we live in.
I'm afraid I was unwise in advising her to take Harry back after they'd separated.
Who knows, my friend?
When women reach the age of maturity...
...Mother Nature sometimes overworks their frustration...
...to a point of irrationalism.
Like the middle-aged man of our age...
...who finds himself looking longingly...
...at a girl in her early 20s.
Harry!
What was that?
Harry!
Harry.
I'll get Dr. Cushing.
Harry. I want him here.
Nancy, Nancy, calm yourself. Morphine.
Harry's asleep in his room.
He'll be right here.
- Harry!
- Call the sheriff.
Harry.
Harry!
Sheriff's office, please.
And hurry, operator, it's urgent.
- Harry.
- Hello. Sheriff Dubbitt.
Have you found Mr. Archer yet?
No, ma'am, but I left messages everywhere in town.
Oh, she did, huh?
She is?
Yes, ma'am, I know it's an emergency.
All right, I will, right away.
Hi, Mary. I'm going over to Tony's Club and then I'm heading out to the Archers'.
If Sheriff Dubbitt calls in, tell him he'd better get out there too.
Thank you, baby. Bye.
No, there's no cutting in here at Tony's Club, buddy.
- Mr. Archer.
- Why, it's the deputy.
What can we do for you this time?
Your house has been trying to get you all evening.
- Didn't the bartender give you my message?
- He did.
And now you've delivered it in person.
Anything else?
No...
Well, yes, there is.
They say it's important. An emergency.
Well, thanks.
All right.
Let's see, now. Where were we, huh?
- Here.
- Oh, yeah.
Never should have kept this out of the papers.
The poor girl, she's had so much publicity all her life.
I'm afraid now there's no alternative.
We'll have to notify the authorities.
If you hadn't given her that sedative, there's no telling what would have happened.
Well, thank heaven we got the chains on her arms and legs.
- How long will the morphine be effective?
- No telling, with the size of her body.
But we'll have to keep her under sedation until the state police arrive.
I'll phone the authorities at Baker.
Operator.
Doctor! Dr. Cushing, it's her.
She's come to again.
- Dr. Cushing!
- Hither, nurse. More morphine.
Operator. Operator. Operator.
This is Mary, your operator.
What's going on there?
What's happening?
Hurry with that morphine, Cushing.
She's loose.
She'll tear the roof off.
Operator. Operator.
It's dead.
I know where my husband is.
He's with that woman.
I'll find him.
She's loose.
A tank couldn't have done a better job.
She... She's heading for town.
Hi, chief. I was just on my way over to the Archers'.
I think Mrs. Archer finally came to.
Say, they've been asking for you over there.
- Did you find anything out there?
- Get moving, will you?
Yeah, sure, sure, hop in.
Say, where's the station wagon, chief?
Doctor. Doctor, give us a hand with the door.
Here's the sheriff's car.
Holy Toledo. What happened?
Thank heaven you're here.
It's Mrs. Archer. She's on a rampage.
- We've got to warn the town.
- She's grown into a giant.
Never mind. Get into the car.
We'll explain as we go along.
Drive to town.
Uranium.
This is just make-believe.
A lot of junk to sell to the people.
It ain't like the old days when we could go out prospecting for gold...
...with a sluice box and water.
I can see it now.
Come on, Hazel. Come on.
Hey, hey, hey, Tony.
Something's happened to your lights.
I got eyes. I can see.
- Who needs lights?
- Well, I need another drink.
- Hey, Ton. Tony.
- Oh, you're a good fellow, Tony.
Attaboy, Ton.
- Mellow, mellow...
- Happy birthday, Honey.
Well, wouldn't you know it.
Can't you drive any faster?
What happened?
Was it a giant woman?
- Going toward town?
- Let's hurry.
Harry.
She'll tear up the whole town until she finds Harry.
Yeah, then she'll tear up Harry.
See if you can locate him and put him in the police car.
We'll try and draw her off.
I'll call Baker for help.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Let's get the sheriff.
- Hey, what's going on here?
- Harry!
It sounds like someone's calling your name.
Harry!
Harry!
It's your wife.
She's wrecking the town looking for you.
- Come on, I gotta get you out of here.
- No.
If she sees me out there, she'll kill me.
She's crazy.
Come on, Mr. Archer, we gotta get out of here.
You're a deputy. Do something.
I can't shoot a lady.
Give me the gun. Give me that gun.
No. No, no, Mrs. Archer.
Help me move this beam, Charlie.
She's dead.
No. No, Nancy. Nancy.
No! Nancy.
Nancy. Nancy, no.
Nancy, no.
Nancy, don't.
Oh, no.
- Don't, Nancy. You killed Honey.
- No.
Nancy, no. Put me down.
You killed Honey. Nancy, no.
Nancy, no. No.
You're crushing me. I can't breathe.
Hurry. Hurry.
She's got Harry. She's got Harry.
- Why doesn't the sheriff do something?
- She's squeezing him to death.
Put him down, Mrs. Archer.
Sheriff, you're not gonna use that on her.
What do you want me to do?
Put salt on her tail?
She's down.
Let's take a look.
Let's go.
All right, everybody keep back now.
Come on. Stand back there.
She finally got Harry all to herself.
This is Operation Experiment.
A secret base far north of the Arctic Circle.
Experiment was the code name for this top-priority scientific expedition.
These men arrived here on X-day minus 60.
It has taken them the full two months to get ready.
Today is X-day.
It is now H-hour minus 59 minutes.
There is less than an hour left.
The plane must arrive at its rendezvous
200 miles away in exactly 58 minutes.
There can be no margin for error.
There can be no second chance.
This is the rendezvous. The forward observation post where scientists... and their aides double-check equipment and wait for the plane's approach.
It is now H-hour minus 81 seconds.
At H-hour minus 75 seconds, the radar antenna flashes the word.
There it is! Azimuth: 63 degrees.
Airplane sighted: 13 hours, 11 minutes.
Azimuth: 63 degrees.
Speed: Approximately 350 miles per hour.
Professor Tom Nesbitt and Col. John Evans, military liaison, tensely wait.
The timing is perfect, thus far.
It is now H-hour minus 56 seconds.
Every man here knows his job.
He does it quickly, efficiently, silently.
The men are ready. The equipment is ready.
It is now H-hour minus 52 seconds.
Operation Experiment to Y-3-4-7.
Operation Experiment to Y-3-4-7. Over.
Y-3-4-7 to Operation Experiment.
Now leveling off.
Ground speed: 360. Approaching IP.
IP means initial point.
The next 26 seconds will determine whether these men have succeeded or failed.
Now we count the seconds.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six... five, four, three, two, one.
Charlie, look!
Col. Evans, there's something strange on the radar screen.
- What's the matter, Charlie?
- Right here, sir. A foreign object.
- It's gone.
- What's gone?
- I don't know, sir.
- It silhouetted like 500 tons, at least.
- Where is it, then?
- I don't know, sir.
- Are you sure we saw it?
- We saw something.
Maybe the shock tossed something in front of the antenna. That must have been it.
Eight weeks of preparation, and it's all over in a second.
Jack, when energy of that magnitude is released, it's never over.
What the cumulative effects of these atomic explosions and tests will be...
- ...only time can tell.
- You mean scientists can't tell?
The world's been here for millions of years.
Man's been walking upright for a comparatively short time.
Mentally, we're still crawling.
This test will add to our knowledge.
Wouldn't you say so, Ritchie?
That's right.
Every time one of these goes off...
I feel we're helping to write the first chapter of a new Genesis.
Let's hope we don't find ourselves writing the last chapter of the old one.
- You sound like a man who's scared, Tom.
- What makes you think I'm not?
Here are the figures, Tom.
We'll leave for the observation post in about an hour.
- Good. Loomis?
- Yes, sir?
- Get the equipment ready.
- Yes, sir.
You gentlemen. The moment your Geiger counters indicate heavy radiation, turn back.
Turn back? Colonel, we'll run back.
There isn't a hero in the crowd.
Post 16.
Shall we try to go around, sir?
No, wait here for us. We'll go up on foot.
- What's your reading?
- 19.7. We'd better get out.
I'll check post 17. You take 18, and I'll meet you back here.
Make it fast.
Sgt. Willistead.
What?
But they've gone on foot.
Okay.
What's the matter?
There's a blizzard coming up!
Tom!
Tom! Tom!
Tom!
Tom!
Tom, I can't move.
Something's wrong with my leg.
I'm coming down.
- Have they reported back yet?
- No, not yet. We're waiting.
Tom, Tom! Get out, Tom! A monster!
- A prehistoric monster!
- Quiet, quiet. Don't struggle.
I'll get you out, George. Don't worry.
Doc! Hey, doc!
Put him right over here.
- Give me my bag.
- Yes, sir.
And get some blankets off those other beds.
How is he?
- Where's Professor Ritchie?
- Still missing, sir.
- What happened?
- We don't know.
We saw the flares and rushed to post 18.
The whole shore was breaking loose.
- We grabbed Nesbitt just in time.
- We never found Ritchie.
Colonel, we have to get Nesbitt to a hospital in the States.
- He's in a bad way.
- Right.
Get word to the main base.
We want a plane right away.
Ritchie, I'll get you out.
I'll get you out.
The monster... Hurry, it's coming!
Watch out, the monster! The monster!
Hello, Professor Nesbitt.
How do you feel today?
Fine. Where is Col. Evans?
Did you reach Col. Evans?
He'll be here any minute now.
I'd like you to meet Dr. Ingersol.
He wants to ask you a few questions, if you don't think it would be too hard on you.
- Questions?
- I'm a psychiatrist, Professor Nesbitt.
I thought together we might get to the bottom of this.
You think I'm crazy too.
My story may sound fantastic, but...
Throughout history, people have claimed that they've seen monsters.
There was the famous Loch Lomond monster, you'll probably recall.
Then the green serpents off the shores of Ireland.
But not one of them was ever caught or even photographed.
I'm not inclined to let my imagination run away with me. I'm a scientist.
All right.
Then it shouldn't be inconceivable to you... that the mind can withstand just so much pressure.
The shock of seeing your friend dead, your own predicament... was too much to bear. So that you momentarily lost contact with reality.
It's a phenomenon which was not uncommon during the war.
But Ritchie wasn't dead when
I got to him. He tried to warn me.
Two people don't share the same hallucination.
Hello, Tom. How are you?
- Thawed out?
- Jack, I'm glad you're here.
I'm having a hard time convincing them that I'm not an idiot.
I was in Washington making my report.
I was...
What did they say about the animal? I want to be in on any expedition going after him.
Tom, I didn't tell them about the animal.
Why not? It should've been in the report.
I went back to Post 18. I tried to reconstruct what happened out there.
I couldn't find a thing.
No tracks. Nothing.
Nothing?
I'm sorry. I wish
I could say I saw something.
The blizzard.
There was a blizzard, remember?
The snow must have blown over and covered everything.
- Check me out of here.
- You are in no condition to leave.
It's imperative that you have rest.
- How can I rest?
- I've encountered this sort of thing before.
You've undergone a tremendous shock.
You've got to stay in bed.
I see. And that makes it official?
I'm afraid it does.
So long. You do what the doctor says. We'll get together when you're on your feet.
That won't be too long.
What about that sound I heard?
In your condition, it could have been anything. The wind. Anything.
No wind ever made a sound like that.
Captain. Captain!
Are you daft, man?
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
What's going on in our turbulent world today?
Oh, death and politics. The comic page is the only thing that makes sense anymore.
I take it, then, that you advise a dose of it after each meal?
- You quote me exactly.
- Then I'm gonna take your advice exactly.
Here it is.
Say.
Look at this!
That item is right where it belongs.
On the comic page.
And that's why I came here, Dr. Elson.
I felt if you heard my story, you'd do something.
And what is it you think I can do?
Fit out an expedition, institute a search.
The fitting out of an expedition requires a great deal of attention to detail.
Such as time, personnel, money.
How can you talk about details in the face of such a discovery?
I'm not a paleontologist, and I have a desire to know more about this animal.
I thought you'd have such a compelling curiosity... that nothing would stand in your way.
Professor Nesbitt, after waiting for 30 years...
I'm about to undertake my first extended holiday.
I would throw aside my plans if I thought there was... the slightest chance of what your saying being possible. It isn't.
What about that newspaper item?
If all the items of seamen reporting monsters were placed end on end... it'd reach to the moon, my boy.
You mean, I'm wasting your time?
Do you realize you're asking me to believe... you saw a creature that would be over 100 million years old?
But you said that 100 million years ago, the water of the Mesozoic age turned to ice.
Isn't it possible that an animal was trapped in that ice?
Caught in the freezing temperatures and locked in.
Then when we released the bomb, the heat generated melted the ice... in which this beast was imprisoned and freed it?
Bringing it back to life after 100 million years?
Couldn't it have been in a state of hibernation?
Bears live through winters under similar conditions.
That's quite true.
A bear does live off itself for one winter from food accumulated within itself... but it's hard to believe an animal could live for 100 million years off its own tissue.
To put it mildly, it would require quite an appetite, don't you think?
I don't know if this will be of any help, but you remember, doctor... a few years ago, an expedition unearthed a herd of mastodons in the Siberian tundra.
Dead thousands of years, yet their fur was still intact, the meat still edible.
That's quite right, my dear Lee.
But they weren't alive.
That's the important difference.
They weren't alive.
I'm sorry, professor, but in all honesty,
I can't support your story.
I guess I'll go back to the hospital.
Maybe I should ask for a transfer to the psychopathic ward.
Nonsense.
It's not as bad as all that, my boy.
Thanks for listening, doctor.
When he first came to this country,
I attended his lectures... on the curative properties of the radioactive isotope. He is a brilliant man.
Isn't his story in any way feasible?
No. And I'm sorry.
I'd rather like to help him.
I thought that little jaunt of yours last week would knock you for a loop.
I can't find anything wrong with you.
I feel fine.
When do you think I can leave?
Any time's all right with us.
Don't go rushing to the North Pole again.
Keep fit and warm.
Take those vitamins I gave you.
This is your hour of mirth and melody.
They say music has charms to soothe the savage beast.
They ought to try it on these sea monsters.
From Canada comes word of a second ship... destroyed by an enormous beast according to Captain LeMay.
He really ought to stop smoking that stuff and try Virginia Golds, because...
It shouldn't take me too long to catch up.
- It's good to have you back.
- Thank you.
Anything else, Miss Ryan?
Oh, yes. There's Miss Lee Hunter waiting to see you.
- Miss Lee Hunter?
- She's very pretty.
Send her in.
- How are you?
- Fine.
We met at the university.
I'm Dr. Elson's assistant.
Oh, yes, of course.
The verdict: A prehistoric animal would be presumptuous to be alive today... and upset your neatly cataloged theories.
I see you don't remember
I was a sympathetic bystander.
Oh, really? How come?
I have a deep, abiding faith in the work of scientists. Otherwise I wouldn't be one.
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.
Sorry I can't offer you anything, but everything around here is radioactive.
No, thank you, anyway.
When I was in the lab yesterday...
I heard a report about a man who claimed that his ship was sunk by a sea monster.
"If all the stories about sea monsters were laid end to end, they'd reach the moon."
But two reports coming so close together...
What makes you think two are going to convince anybody any more than one did?
Well, it convinced me.
It got me to thinking it would be worthwhile investigating.
I've gathered all the sketches of the known prehistoric animals. If you could identify...
Being considered crazy has been quite an experience.
However, I wouldn't care to go through it again.
Is this the man with the compelling curiosity? Afraid of ridicule?
- I'm not afraid of ridicule.
- No?
But I'm afraid that's what it sounds like.
You said sketches of all the known animals?
What if it's an unknown one?
That's possible.
But we'll never really know unless you look at them.
Oh, professor, think what it would mean if you were right.
Five-minute break. It's coffee time.
Good. I need it.
Cream and sugar?
Better take both. I make coffee strong enough to enter the Olympics.
- One or two?
- Two, please.
I never knew there were so many prehistoric animals.
We haven't even reached the Cretaceous Period yet.
I don't know if I could identify the beast now if it looked through the window.
Maybe it's part imagination, after all.
Something I used to dream about when I was a kid. Or read in fairy tales.
You're tired. Why don't you just relax for a moment. Have a sandwich.
Thanks.
- Funny.
- What's funny?
Well, a girl like you, a paleontologist.
What's wrong with paleontology?
- Classifying old bones.
- Old bones?!
If we didn't study the past, you wouldn't know about the atom.
Dr. Elson says, "Future is the reflection of the past."
You're fond of Dr. Elson, aren't you?
How did you become his assistant?
I suppose by continually antagonizing him.
I was one of his students.
To hear him tell it, all I ever did was challenge him or argue with him.
I was afraid he was going to expel me.
Instead, he asked me to be his assistant after I graduated.
So I graduated, and here I am.
And here I am.
Between us, we span the ages.
You deal with the past, I with the future.
How uncomplicated the past was.
And how bright the future can be.
Let's get back to the present.
This might be it.
I'm not sure.
Not sure?
The head looks similar, but the front legs are too short.
Wait a minute.
Is this any better?
Now, that's much more like it.
And what about this one?
That's the closest!
I think that is it.
Lee, I think that's the one I saw!
If two independent observers saw the same thing...
If that captain in Canada could identify the same sketch...
And tell his story to Dr. Elson.
"Capt. George LeMay, Marquette, Canada."
- Operator.
- I want to make a long-distance call, please.
Person-to-person.
To Capt. George LeMay, Marquette, Canada.
One moment, please.
- Charge this call to Circle 44771.
- Thank you.
It's my monster.
They're speaking French.
- Capt. LeMay is ready.
- Thank you.
Hello. Capt. LeMay?
My name is Tom Nesbitt.
I'm a scientist in New York.
I have some important questions to ask you.
I don't speak English.
Captain?
- Hello. Capt. LeMay?
- I am sorry, but the captain has hung up.
He is unhappy when anybody mentions his accident, because everyone laughs.
Please get the captain back.
I can't tell you how important this is.
I am sorry. He will not speak to you again, I'm sure.
He is a stubborn old man. Perhaps a little crazy. Especially on the subject of serpents.
They think he is crazy too.
- Well, it was a good try anyway.
- But good tries don't pay off.
Do you suppose if you went up there... you could make him understand how important this is?
I could get a plane.
Phone me if anything exciting happens.
I'll phone you even if nothing happens.
You missed him by not more than two hours.
I thought you might be able to tell me where he went. His housekeeper wouldn't.
Capt. LeMay has been very touchy since the sea serpent incident.
People felt he was a bit balmy.
They laughed at him. Too bad too.
The man had served well and faithfully for years.
I believe a man has a right to a few nips now and then, I always say.
- You don't believe his story?
- I said he was balmy, not me.
He let it get out that he was headed for the interior of Canada... and was not going to stop until he hit a spot that was uninhabited by white men.
A blooming hermit he wants to be.
He'll be back in less than a month.
I can't wait that long.
- Were there any other survivors?
- No.
- How far is it to St. Pierre?
- About 100 miles.
Are you going to see this other chap who claims he saw it?
I say, you don't believe in the sea serpent fable, do you?
What do you think I am, balmy?
Good evening, Jacob.
You look much better today.
A man is here.
A very great scientist from New York.
No, Sister. Take him away.
I want no one near me.
He went to so much trouble to find you.
Why?
He says it is very important.
It's about the beast you saw.
Tell him to leave me alone!
Tell him I saw nothing!
Tell him I know nothing!
Tell him it's all in my head!
That's what everybody says.
Except me, Jacob.
- Who are you?
- I saw the beast too.
You saw him?
- You're not playing jokes on me?
- No, I'm not playing any jokes.
People called me crazy too.
It stays in my mind always.
I'll never forget it.
In New York, there are scientists, friends of mine, who will listen and believe.
Jacob, will you come to New York with me?
- Is he well enough to travel?
- I will ask the doctor.
There's something very compensating in having to wait 30 years for a holiday.
Because when it finally comes... the joy of anticipation is multiplied by just that many years.
I feel like a schoolboy on the verge of departing for my first summer camp.
Oh, by the way, that reminds me, our young nuclear physicist appears to be delayed.
He'll be here any minute.
Shouldn't take him long from the airport.
Mesozoic animal alive today.
I can lose my job and my reputation listening to such nonsense.
However, I won't allow my personal opinion to interfere with a possible romance.
Don't change the subject.
You're just being stubborn.
Am I?
Now, just you listen to this.
It's something that I read this morning.
"On the 21 st of October, in the year 1797, one Professor Gordon Laughton... was forcibly removed, by order of the Crown... from his chair of science at the University of Edinburgh.
He was firmly convinced that leprechauns were responsible... for the uprooting of the ancient campus oak.
Even swearing upon oath that he had seen them remove it."
So, you see, today, it's monsters instead of leprechauns.
How certain are you there were no leprechauns?
Hello, Lee.
I don't recall this Dr. Laughton, but what about Galileo?
He said the earth was round.
They made him recant.
However, the earth is round. And there is a monster. And I think I can convince you.
- Is this your sailor witness?
- Yes, sir.
Jacob Bowman, the helmsman of the fishing boat Fortune. Dr. Elson, Miss Hunter.
- So you saw the monster too?
- Yes, sir.
Go ahead, my dear.
This is your experiment.
Jacob, I want you to look through those sketches and pick out the one you saw.
You don't think this is a waste of time?
Several days ago at Miss Hunter's apartment...
I picked out the sketch of the beast
I saw. It's right in that batch.
But, unfortunately, in paleontology, the empirical system of logic isn't enough.
It isn't a question of empirics.
If a particle of the sun broke off and flew into space...
I wouldn't consider the man who brought that news to be insane.
As a scientist, I would examine every facet of it.
Yes, but if a particle of the sun were to break off, 100 million people would see it.
If it broke off, it would make no difference if one saw it or no one at all.
It would still be.
The same with the monster. It still is.
Perhaps I'm getting old.
Now, Jacob, you must be quite sure about this creature you claim to have seen.
There must be no doubt in your mind.
If it's here, I'll know it.
- That.
- That's the one I picked.
It's the rhedosaurus, extinct for 100 million years.
- A hundred million years?
- Yes.
And the direct ancestor of that little lady there.
Only twice the size, according to theory.
The only fossils of its species ever discovered... were found in a drag of the Hudson submarine canyons.
A hundred and fifty miles from New York.
Didn't Professor Edmonds write a paper on that just last year?
Yes.
Yes.
If we could only be sure, without a shadow of a doubt...
What further proof do you need?
Things have happened again and again, and they'll continue.
I tried to get the authorities to keep the coastline under close watch...
- ...they wouldn't listen to me.
- They'll listen this time.
Get them on the phone. I'll talk to them.
Thanks.
Col. Evans, please.
Jack.
Tom Nesbitt.
I feel great.
That hallucination of mine... the one that everybody was having such a good laugh about?
Well, I've got proof the monster exists.
Now, Tom, let's not start that again.
What?
I can just see myself requesting permission to seek out a prehistoric monster.
Eagles on a straitjacket are not regulation uniform.
I'm here at the university with Dr. Elson, the foremost paleontologist in the world.
Just a moment. He wants to talk to you.
Col. Evans. This is Dr. Elson.
I'm convinced that Professor Nesbitt is onto something.
There have been all kinds of stories.
Stories of sea serpents... stories of the world coming to an end, stories of flying saucers.
What makes you so sure there are no flying saucers?
Nevertheless, I'm convinced that by some strange trick of chance, this creature exists.
And I'm prepared to stake my reputation on it.
I'm sure you know what you're talking about, doctor... but it would look foolish if we stick our neck out.
Will you promise if any reports come in, you'll let us know?
I've got a friend in the Coast Guard.
I'll drop in to see him.
If he's heard of anything,
I'll get in touch with you. Okay?
Thank you, colonel. We'll appreciate it.
He's going to check and let us know.
- We can't just sit around.
- I'm afraid there's nothing else we can do.
But wait.
I heard a new song at the tavern the other day.
Something about gin and wild women.
- How'd it go?
- Oh, I don't remember.
I stuck five nickels in the box to hear it again... and the thing busted down.
You know me, I couldn't carry a tune in a bushel basket.
I like the ballads. The old ones that warm you even when the fog is a foot thick.
Did you hear that?
Come in.
That's all.
- Jack, how are you?
- Phil, at this moment, I don't know.
Well, sit down. Sit down.
I haven't seen you since the last Army-Navy game.
What a game that was.
What's the problem? AEC getting you down?
- No, not at all.
- Good.
Stick around. I'll be through in a minute. We'll go to the club.
Phil, here it is straight.
One of the scientists in the last polar test claims he saw a monster.
The dean of the College of Natural History believes him.
Then who am I to doubt it? Are you trying to get a Section 8 discharge?
A neurotic colonel.
These scientists claim that this monster or beast, this prehistoric thing... and if you laugh, I'll brain you, is romping around the North Atlantic.
I guess you'll have to brain me.
You're nuts!
Anyway, that's what they say.
Look, Phil. Would you do me a favor?
Check around to see if there have been any reports of any freak or unusual happenings.
- Are you on the level?
- If standing on my head's on the level, I am.
You certainly sound serious.
All right, I'll check. But so help me, if this is a practical joke...
I'll die laughing.
Well, that's it.
No storm, no earthquake, nothing... but that lighthouse was destroyed completely.
Were there any other unexplained happenings?
Yes. Coast Guard station 37 reported minor shore wreckage... along the Massachusetts coast.
Several isolated buildings were destroyed.
And a farmer was found crushed to death.
There's a certain inexorable chronology in these disasters.
I don't follow you, doctor.
Tom first saw the rhedosaurus near Baffin Bay.
While his latest presumed presence was off the coast of Massachusetts.
- May I look at your chart, captain?
- Of course.
Now, first... north of Baffin Bay.
Second, the fishing ketch Fortune was wrecked here... off the Grand Banks.
And another one attacked shortly thereafter.
Here. Nova Scotia.
Third, the lighthouse off the coast of Maine.
Fourth, unexplained wreckage off the coast of Massachusetts.
You'll notice we've been following the Arctic Current all the way down.
So it's just possible that he might be making for here.
It was in these submerged canyons that the only fossils of his species were found.
We could mine those canyons.
And kill the rhedosaurus? Oh, no.
Think what a loss to science that would be. Oh, no.
But to capture it alive would be an achievement.
How do you propose to capture it, if it exists?
I don't know. But if we ascertain it's down there in the canyons...
I'll have to go see it before I decide upon a method of capture.
That's much too dangerous.
Yes, but then the risk would be worth it when one thinks of the benefit to science.
Captain, is it possible to obtain the use of a diving bell?
- You really want to go down there?
- Yes.
I can get a diving bell.
What do you think, Jack?
Everything else checks out.
If he can get it, let's move.
Thank you.
I still don't see how he's gonna find it.
This canyon is 100 miles long.
As I understand it, he plans to drop down at a different spot every hour till he finds it.
Hear this. Hear this. We are now ready to make the dive at position number one.
I don't like the idea of you going with just one man.
That's capacity. If there's any danger, my crewman will know what to do.
- I brought your Dramamine.
- No, thank you.
I'm much too excited to get seasick.
Are you ready, Dr. Elson?
Remember, at the first sign of danger, signal us.
Why will you persist in talking about danger?
The rhedosaurus and I are old friends.
- Good luck, doctor.
- Thank you.
- Here you are, sir.
- Thank you.
Don't look so worried, Lee.
We're scientists.
This is our job.
This is a great moment for me.
Everything shipshape in there?
Splendid, thank you.
All the comforts of home. Lower away.
Hoist away.
Is there anything I have to do?
Oh, no, sir.
You just relax and enjoy the scenery.
This is such a strange feeling.
I feel I am leaving a world of untold tomorrows... for a world of countless yesterdays.
Lee was right. I should have brought the Dramamine pills.
This is all very frustrating. I do hope all our endeavors are not going to be in vain.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, doctor.
We are having coffee now.
And some visitors.
There appears to be a difference of opinion between two of the local inhabitants.
There he is!
It's unbelievable.
He's tremendous.
I can only see part of him... the leg and the shoulder, but he is enormous.
He found it. Shall we pull you up?
No! No! No, put Lee on.
He wants to talk to you.
Yes, doctor.
Lee, there's no mistake about it.
It's a Paleolithic survival.
It's exactly as we pictured it except the dorsal is singular, not bilateral.
The clavicle suspension appears to be cantileveric.
But the most astonishing thing about it is...
He doesn't answer.
- Get him up.
- Raise the bell.
We're pulling you up! Dr. Elson!
Can you hear me? Answer me!
The line is dead.
Well, the report has been turned in.
The National Guard and Coast Guard have been alerted. Evans is in charge.
This was being packed for a very different reason.
What can I say?
I should have gone down instead of him.
I am to blame.
Nobody is to blame.
And everybody is to blame.
We all did what we thought was right.
But that doesn't bring him through the door again.
With his funny little walk, and that wonderful smile.
This place seems so empty.
He used to putter around with the specimens and call them pet names.
His death was so futile.
He went down in that bell because it was part of his job.
He used those same words just before...
Oh, Tom.
It's coming up Nassau Street toward Pine.
Get some help fast!
New York is like a city besieged.
A state of emergency has been declared... and the entire police force put on 24-hour duty.
Civilian defense is fully mobilized... and shelters have been opened in an effort to stop the mounting hysteria.
All traffic has been halted.
And Times Square, the heart of New York, has stopped beating.
The National Guard has been called out, fully armed, to repel the invader.
This is full-scale war against a terrible enemy... such as modern man has never before faced.
Ordinary bullets have no effect... and a method of destroying the awesome creature has not yet been formulated.
But the battlefield has been cleared.
Herald Square.
34th Street.
Broadway.
Every section of the city is guarded.
No one knows where the monster will strike next.
It was last seen on Wall Street, close to where it came ashore.
But lower Manhattan has become no man's land... where the beast, at present, lies hidden.
The National Guard is barricading the area... in an effort to confine the death and destruction... of what is already the worst disaster in New York's history.
A screen here.
105 temperature.
Here's the blood specimen.
Get it to the laboratory quickly.
I'm afraid, Sam.
I am afraid of what that creature has brought to us. Deadly afraid.
- Think you can place it between his eyes?
- We can try, sir.
- Fire when ready, corporal.
- Yes, sir.
His skull... it's at least 8 inches thick.
- Another one, colonel?
- No.
It would take a 3-inch shell to penetrate that skull.
Bazooka squad, prepare to fire.
The high-voltage wires, it's gonna touch them!
Bazooka men, fire!
Under the neck, when he raises his head again.
Get those emergency search lights on!
We're working on it.
Sergeant. Sergeant!
- What is it?
- Blood.
Give me the walkie-talkie.
Col. Evans. Col. Evans?
Sgt. Wyntoni.
Now, look, proceed with extreme caution.
Wounded, the animal might be twice as dangerous as before.
There's a possibility the animal might've headed for the river.
We'll have all shore batteries alerted and naval patrol vessels.
Get me a command car!
- Col. Evans speaking, go ahead.
- Look, colonel... something's funny.
Most of the detail, they're...
Well, they're out.
Out on their feet, sir.
Have your sergeant contact the medics.
And report to Capt. Mitchell.
Your car is ready, sir.
Have the medical officer report to me at area command.
Yes, sir.
He is reported somewhere in the lower bay area.
- Battery A in position zero.
- Battery A into position zero.
- Report radar findings.
- Report radar finding.
Sounding harbor bottom.
Sounding harbor bottom.
- Activate mines, numbers 8 to 24.
- Activate mines, numbers 8 to 24.
What's the situation, major?
We're sounding the harbor bottom.
No indications yet, sir.
Charting room. Col. Evans?
Majors, there's a call here for Col. Evans.
This is Evans speaking. Who?
Oh, yes. Hello, doctor.
Colonel, they've already brought in over 50 of your men and the people this afternoon.
The monster's a giant germ-carrier of a horrible, virulent disease.
Contact with the animal's blood can be fatal.
If you use shell-fire, who knows how far the air will spread the particles of it.
- The entire city can be endangered.
- Right, doctor.
- Have the anti-submarine nets been raised?
- No, sir.
Order them raised.
- Raise the anti-submarine nets.
- Raise the anti-submarine nets.
Flamethrowers would've cremated the beast and the plague with it.
Flamethrowers? The smoke would have carried the blood particles just as far.
No, it will have to be reduced so that not even a cinder would remain.
Any reports yet, major?
No signs yet, colonel.
He may be dying at the bottom.
We'll set the drags in the morning.
Attention! Monster ashore at Manhattan
Beach, heading towards amusement area.
- On land?
- I thought we had him in a corner pocket.
Jack, there's only one way to beat him.
How?
Radioactive isotope.
Shoot it into him and destroy all that diseased tissue.
Keep your men alerted.
But nobody's to fire unless ordered to.
Yes, sir.
How soon, Tom?
Should be any minute now.
Wait for us here.
- I'm Professor Nesbitt.
- We've got your baby, professor.
Good.
- We need your best marksman, Jack.
- Right.
Have him get into these.
Here's your man, Tom.
- Colonel says you need a dead shot, mister.
- Yes.
- Ever use a grenade rifle?
- Pick my teeth with it.
Good.
You know what a radioactive isotope is?
- No, but if it can be loaded, I can fire it.
- I'll load it.
Just remember one thing:
It has to be shot into the wound.
And you have to make it the first time.
This is the only isotope of its kind this side of Oak Ridge, so you can't miss.
Let's get to the target.
I can't hit him from here, mister.
- Ever ride one of those things?
- Yes, sir.
Jack! Get somebody over here who can operate that roller coaster!
We want to get to the top in one of those cars.
Right!
- Put your hood on.
- Yes, sir.
Good afternoon, sir.
HoW can I help you, Miss?
Haven't they come from The Sicomoros to pick me up?
The Sicomoros?
You're Miss Marta González,
Don Emilio's niece, right?
Yes, sir, hasn't my uncle come to pick me up?
Yes. He Was here at noon, but left
When he heard about the landslide.
And, What time is he going to be back?
No, I don't think he'll be back, Miss.
We thought We Wouldn't have trains until tomorroW, but as you can see, they've been stopping here since half an hour.
Isn't there anybody Who can take me to The Sicomoros?
I'm afraid not, Miss.
People don't go out after sunset.
So, What should I do?
You can only Wait until tomorroW.
Look, that man over there has the same problem.
Miss, don't ask any more questions,
I've already tried everything.
But, my aunt is very sick, and I need to get to The Sicomoros tonight.
Yes, I also lied about my nepheW's Baptism, but it didn't Work.
Come With me, this Will take a While, take a seat and relax. Here, I'll help you.
You knoW, it seems that people here are terrified to leave their houses after sunset...
I Wanted to Walk to the closest toWn, about three hours aWay from here, but that fat man over there Wouldn't let me.
Someone's coming.
What an ugly man.
Yes, he is not very attractive, you're right.
I've come to pick up that box.
Here's the ticket.
All right, it's all yours.
Isn't it a shame to have someone deliver soil from Hungary?
Soil?
What's Wrong With our soil?
Whims of the rich.
It's for a man called Mr. Duval,
Who's lived here for 10 years.
I think he's a little bit crazy, he's very odd, only goes out at night and Wears a black cape like that one.
Wait a minute, I have an idea.
Good afternoon, sir, sorry to bother you, but, can you give a ride to that lady?
She's very pretty and she'd be good company on the road.
I'm not going into toWn.
She neither, she's going to The Sicomoros.
Where?
To The Sicomoros.
All right.
- Tell her to come here.
- Thank you.
It's all settled.
He'll take you to The Sicomoros.
Hurry.
But, Where are you going?
I'm going Where you're going.
Just go.
If you're going to The Sicomoros.
Then, I'm going to The Sicomoros.
Let's go, pal.
Just a moment, Wait.
I Want to see her one last time.
I can keep it, sir.
Rest in peace, beloved sister.
This is What she alWays Wanted, patrón,
God Wants her to rest here for ever.
Thus Will be, The Sicomoros
Will alWays belong to us.
Anselmo...!
Read this.
What happened?
You should get off here.
But, this is not The Sicomoros.
I take a detour here, you can continue on that road.
Take us there,
We'll pay you Whatever you Want.
I can't...
Get doWn, get doWn.
All right, all right.
Bastard, he could've taken us there.
Well, Where are We noW?
At the crossroad.
We need to folloW that fence to The Sicomoros.
Is it far from here?
- Half an hour from here.
- Half an hour?
Miss, if We're going to Walk for half an hour, in this foggy and deserted place,
We'd better get to knoW each other, don't you think?
My name is Enrique.
I'm Marta.
Nice to meet you.
Well, noW I'll tell you some things about me.
I have a mole on my back, on this side.
I hate the countryside, because I think it's a place for coWs, not for people, and I'm a commercial traveller.
I Work in a store, and they let me...
...my uncle Emilio Wrote to me tWo days ago saying that I should come today, that I should be here no matter What.
Your ill aunt's husband?
No, they're brothers,
I have another aunt living in The Sicomoros, but none of them is married.
Hey, Miss, are you sure this is the right Way?
This seems a bit long to me.
Sure, I knoW this place.
I hope my aunt isn't seriously ill.
She Was like a mother to me.
She raised me as a child.
Hey, Why didn't they get married?
Are they too ugly?
No, on the contrary, they Were very pretty
When they Were young, noW they're too old.
They just lived in the Hacienda by themselves and didn't go out.
I can imagine.
What about your uncle?
My uncle Emilio is different.
He travelled all around the World for many years, he came to The Sicomoros tWo months ago.
I still remember the yard full of floWers, the bright hallWays.
The cages With birds.
The fountain.
The most Wonderful memories from my childhood are in that bright yard...
This is called the hanging tree, the road makes a turn here and soon We'll be at the front gate.
What are you looking at?
I don't knoW, I couldn't tell.
I've been having a Weird feeling since he left us on the road.
What do you mean?
I feel that someone has been folloWing us.
I haven't seen anybody.
Me neither, but I felt something cold on my back.
What do you Want?
I'm Marta, my uncle and aunts are Waiting for me.
Yes, Miss, I'll open right noW.
HoW are you, Anselmo?
My child.
Let me help you, sir.
Why is everything so deserted?
Miss, it has been like this for a long time.
It's hard to get people to Work in the Hacienda, no one Wants to Work in Sierra Negra anymore.
A lot of people have left the toWn.
That place is deserted.
It looks like a cemetery.
But, come on in, come in.
It's your niece, sir, and she's With a gentleman.
Martita!
Uncle!
My child...
We thought you Were coming tomorroW.
Yes, I knoW.
Marta!
Don't I get a hug?
It's your aunt...
Eloísa.
Don't you recognize me anymore?
Is this the old aunt?
Aunt!
You look the same as When I left here.
It's been so long.
It's incredible, you look like a different person... and my aunt María Teresa,
Where is she?
She died yesterday...
We've just buried her.
Come on, don't cry... it's no use.
Come on, let's go upstairs.
Excuse me, sir, can you get me my luggage?
Your luggage?
- I'm leaving.
- Why?
I have to go.
Martita, the gentleman is leaving.
I'm sorry, I forgot about him!
This gentleman Was kind enough to bring me here from the station...
Why don't you stay, at least for tonight?
Where are you going to go noW?
To a hotel.
- A hotel?
- Yes.
No, We haven't had hotels in Sierra Negra for a long time noW.
Where are you going to go?
This is your home too, please, stay.
Come this Way.
- Thank you.
- Come in.
I'm so sorry to have come in such a painful time.
It's painful... yes, very much... although We should be happy for her death.
Why do you say that, aunt?
You have no idea hoW much she suffered these last months, right, Emilio?
Yes, in fact, only death could free her from the pain she Was suffering.
HoW did she die?
She suffered a heart attack, but she had been disturbed for five years.
You mean insane?
Yes, she experienced persecutory delusions.
What Were her fears?
Vampires.
Vampires!
Yes, things she heard from the people in the other toWn... they're extremely supersticious.
She Was convinced there Was a vampire someWhere in this house, stalking her to suck her blood, and at night, she suffered even more.
She Would lock herself up in her room and surround herself With all the crucifixes and mirrors in the house.
And, Why Would she do that?
Nonsense, those are legends.
Yes, they say you can scare aWay vampires With crucifixes, and you can find them With mirrors.
Yes, I've heard something like that.
It's said they don't reflect on mirrors, right?
Yes, that's What they say.
Well, excuse my niece.
She's very tired from the trip and I don't think she Wants to hear this.
You're right, aunt, let's go.
Excuse us.
Please, madam.
Do you collect old books?
No, I don't understand a thing about that.
They've alWays been there.
They seem to be part of a file from an old mine in Sierra Negra.
Unfortunately, it's too late, right?
Yes.
Doctor!
I folloWed your instructions, no one knoWs Who I am, or Why I'm here.
Then, keep it that Way until you leave, I beg you.
It'd be very painful if they found out noW the reason you are here.
Soil?
And he Will come to life again, my brother, Count Karol Lavud, buried by his enemies,
Who put an end to his inmortality in this unWorthy crypt.
This is soil from the cemeteries in the Woods of Baconia.
We Will take it to his grave in tWo moons.
Its hidden poWer Will revive him at the very minute of the one hundred anniversary of his death, and then We Will continue enjoying our lost happiness that We shared in other times.
And together, We Will impose in this county the poWer and the domain of the house of Lavud...
Bring the horses, Jorge,
We Will leave immediately.
Do you knoW that you are one of the oWners of The Sicomoros?
No, I didn't knoW it.
María Teresa gave you her part in her Will.
She Was so kind With me.
You are an oWner of The Sicomoros, like Emilio and me.
But, The Sicomoros is not What it used to be.
There are people Who Want to buy it.
They Would pay good money.
But, Would you sell The Sicomoros?
Yes, I Want to sell it.
But Emilio doesn't Want to.
According to the deed, We shall reach a majority of votes
Within the oWners to decide upon the sale.
Then, I'm the one making a decision?
Yes.
Could We talk about this some other day, aunt?
Everything has happened so quickly, that it seems like a nightmare.
Think it over, the house is a Wreck.
People don't Want to Work in the countryside anymore.
But, she is buried here...
What's Wrong, aunt?
Nothing, someone's coming...
Be careful, there's a stranger in the house.
I knoW, don't lose sight of him.
He is a very important neighbor, he may have come to offer condolences.
You should meet him.
Excuse me With him, please,
I'll meet him some other day...
I'm exhausted, and I don't feel like talking to anybody.
All right, I'll take care of him.
Have a good night.
You too, aunt.
Mr. Duval, he's a neighbor.
Duval, Duval...
Oh, I knoW.
You are the importer of soil from Hungary.
What are you saying?
He is just exaggerating.
He may have seen a box With soil that I picked up at the station.
He might think I receive them all the time.
That's just a sample.
If that's a sample, I can't imagine
What a Whole order Would be.
I don't understand.
It's an old tradition.
Don't tell me it's soil from a cemetery.
No, nothing like that.
I'll use it to plant roses from the Woods of Baconia.
The tradition says you should use soil from their origin, that's Why I brought it.
What Was that?
A book fell from the bookshelf.
But, hoW? No one touched it.
It must have slipped...
This is a very interesting book.
It's a manuscript and it's over a 100 years old.
They are all from the same time.
Minutes on the murder of Count Karol de Lavud, founder of The Sicomoros, native of Baconia, in the reign of Hungary...
Well, What a coincidence!
This guy is a relative of yours.
Yes, that's What it seems.
I bet that Lavud is the same that's buried in the crypt.
It might Well be.
Well, according to this book, he has been buried for more than 100 years.
Of course, his headstone is the oldest in the cemetery.
Poor man, he must be all ashes by noW.
The gentleman's room is ready.
Thank you, María.
If you'll excuse me, I'll go to my room.
Can I take this book With me?
I'd like to leaf through it.
Of course.
Thank you...
Nice to meet you, Mr. Duval.
Good night.
ShoW him his room, María.
This Way, please.
Would you shoW me the Way, please?
- Certainly.
- Thank you.
What's your name?
María.
- María, nice name.
- And your last name?
Santoyo, sir.
Interesting felloW.
Why is he here?
I don't knoW.
I think he is a commercial traveller.
He came along With Martita from the station.
I think she doesn't knoW him either.
He'll leave tomorroW.
But, is she already here?
Yes, but she Won't come doWn noW.
She's very tired.
Have you told her that I Want to buy The Sicomoros?
Don't get too excited, Mr. Duval.
Martita has a special affection for this Hacienda and Will probably agree With me on the idea of not selling it.
It'll be a shame if she rejects my offer.
A real shame.
This is your room, sir.
Thank you.
Have a good night.
No, don't go, María. I Want to talk With you.
Tell me, Who helped the lady that died?
A servant, sir.
Those nervous attacks she Was having lately, did she have them at a certain time or at any time of the day?
No, sir, she only had them at night.
My late patrona didn't have nervous attacks, nor Was she crazy.
Well, they Were superstitions then.
No, sir, they Weren't.
They Weren't beliefs either, these Were real things.
Don't tell me a vampire Was stalking her.
Vampires exist, believe it or not.
Have you seen one?
God forbids it... but my grandfather Was killed by one
100 years ago, in the tunnel of a mine.
Several people died during that time, all of them from bleeding neck Wounds.
Nobody Wanted to Work in the mine anymore. It's all ruins noW.
TWo felloWs from toWn killed him afterwards.
They killed him?
The only Way you can kill a vampire, because there's no knife or gunshot that can kill them.
Then, hoW do you get rid of them?
By sticking them a Wood stake in their chest While they are sleeping.
And, you are afraid of a vampire that died 100 years ago?
No, sir, that one is buried in the crypt.
This is a different one.
Nobody has seen him yet, but the same things are happening.
They've already found dead bodies by the roads, all of them With marks on their necks, and Without a trace of blood.
Nobody Wants to go out at night, and even the animals in the mountain have run to other mountains.
That's nonsense.
Don't make fun of What people from the countryside tell you.
Vampires exist.
They sleep in the day and go out at night looking for young people's blood, that's the only thing they eat.
May God protect you, so that they don't kill you nor make you a vampire.
If they bite you tWice, then you Wouldn't groW old and Would live like the souls in the purgartory in eternal inmortality.
Let the Virgen del Socorro take care of you over the night, sir.
Good night.
Receive my condolences once again.
Sleep, sleep.
That I ask the night,
While I take care of you...
- Help us, Father, help us!
- What about some food?
- Father, they're starving us!
- Are you staying, Father?
This man is raving.
Are you sure you wish to see him on your own?
A visitor for you, Baron Frankenstein.
If you need any assistance,
I shall be outside.
They told me you wanted to see me.
Is it spiritual comfort you want? Is that it?
Keep your spiritual comfort for those who think they need it.
I sent for you because I could think of nobody else.
People trust you.
They listen to what you tell them.
Now listen to me, and when I've finished you can pass it on to them.
Then, perhaps, they'll believe me.
- I have to tell you...
- I have to tell you, you just listen!
I'm sorry. If you think my word will carry any authority, I'm afraid you are mistaken.
You'd better not tell me what you consider so important.
- You'll stay.
- Take your hands off me.
- Tell me you'll stay.
- Do you want me to call the guard?
I apologize. Please, sit down.
I said I apologize.
I'll not forget myself again.
As you wish.
Unless I can convince you...
...that what I'm about to tell you is the absolute truth...
...then in one hour from now
I shall be dead.
- I've told you...
- Then, perhaps, you'll understand.
Perhaps you'd better start from the beginning.
Where did it all begin?
I suppose it was when I was a boy at school.
I always had a brilliant intellect.
That fool who taught us may have been able to hoodwink the others...
...but what did he know?
He'd been teaching the same rubbish for 30 years...
...and I don't suppose he'd read a new book for 20 of those.
When my mother died,
I inherited the Frankenstein fortune.
This enabled me to begin the life and work
I had always planned for myself.
Victor, dear boy...
...you are the sole remaining member of the Frankenstein family.
I know you will conduct yourself...
...in a manner which would make your poor, dear mother proud of you.
I shall do my best, Uncle. Thank you.
Thank you all for coming.
Goodbye.
What was it you wished to see me about,
Aunt Sophie?
It is a matter of some delicacy, Victor. L...
Was it about the allowance my mother made you?
You needn't worry.
I shall continue to pay it.
You're a good boy, Victor.
Your poor mother would be proud...
- Yes, yes.
- Elizabeth, thank your cousin.
There's really no need.
Come along, Elizabeth.
Say thank you, nicely.
Thank you.
She's a good girl. She'll grow into a fine woman one day.
- I'm sure she will.
- And she'll make someone a good wife.
- Goodbye.
- Well, goodbye.
The first of the month, your mother used to...
- I understand. I shall do the same.
- Thank you.
Good morning.
Is this the home of the Frankenstein family?
It is.
I'm Paul Krempe. I have an appointment with Baron Frankenstein.
You must be Victor.
I'm going to be your tutor.
So I understand.
But surely it isn't settled yet.
I thought this was just an interview to decide...
...whether you were suitable for the position.
Yes, but I've had correspondence with the Baron...
...and he seemed satisfied with my qualifications.
That's right, he did, didn't he?
- I expect he wanted to see what I look like.
- That must have been it.
- Will you tell your father that I'm here?
- My father is dead.
- That's ridiculous. I had a letter...
- He's been dead for 10 years.
It was I who advertised for a tutor.
It was I who wrote to you.
You're the Baron then, are you?
And have been since I was 5 years old.
And you want a tutor for your son?
I thought it would save a lot of explanation by letter.
A difficult thing at the best of times.
I fail to see that the disclosure of the facts can make any difference.
You were to be engaged as my tutor, subject to the Baron's approval.
You will take up the position.
You will be paid as arranged.
By whom?
By the Baron. I'm quite rich.
Do you still want the position?
I should be honored, Herr Baron.
My first opinion of Paul
was soon confirmed.
He turned out to be an admirable tutor.
In two years I'd learned all he had to teach, but we went on together...
...probing into the unknown, investigating, recording, searching...
...always searching...
...until gradually the sweep of our research began to assume a single direction...
...and to this aim
we finally turned all our energies.
It took us years of unrelenting work to discover what we were seeking.
Then, one night...
...out of sight and sound of the rest of the house...
...our efforts were rewarded.
Paul, it's alive.
Paul, we've done it!
Paul, we've done it!
There was a lag between the cardiac reaction and the first visible signs of life.
That'll be the time required for the heart to circulate blood through the entire body.
If we could delay or prolong the period in which the body is apparently dead...
...while the heart is alive...
...we'd have a living body with only the barest life-spark present.
Think what that would mean when it came to performing major surgery!
We could save hundreds of lives.
Reducing shock to a minimum, no loss of blood.
Victor, the Medical Federation meets next month in Berne.
Can we have our paper ready?
We could.
- But we're not going to.
- Why not?
It doesn't meet again for a year.
Why wait that long?
We must wait.
What we've done up to now is nothing to what we will do.
We've only just started.
Just opened the door.
Now is the time to go through that door and find what lies beyond it.
Don't you see, Paul?
We've discovered the source of life itself...
...and have used it to restore a creature that was dead.
This is a tremendous discovery, but we mustn't share it yet.
We must move on to the next stage.
We've restored life where life was extinct.
It's no longer sufficient to bring the dead back to life.
We must create from the beginning.
We must build up our own creature...
...and build it up from nothing.
From what?
What on earth are you talking about?
Forget the whole.
Now we must take the parts...
...limbs, organs, and then we must build.
- Build what?
- The most complex thing known to man:
Man himself.
We must create a human being...
...with perfect physique, hands of an artist, and a matured brain of a genius.
- We can do it. Don't you see?
- No, I don't.
What you're saying is nonsense, a revolt against nature.
Such a thing could only end in evil.
Come, what's the matter with you?
You haven't shown any scruples up to now.
As for revolting against nature, haven't we done so already and succeeded?
Isn't the thing that's dead supposed to be dead for all time?
Yet we brought it back to life.
We hold in the palms of our hands secrets that have never been dreamed of.
Where nature puts up barriers to confine the scope of man, we've broken through!
- There's nothing to stop us now.
- What is it you want to do?
First we need the framework, the body.
Last week they hanged a man at Engelstadt, a highwayman.
He'd been terrifying the countryside for months. As a warning to others...
...his body has been left on a gibbet, just outside the town.
It'll hang there till it rots...
...or it's stolen.
The birds didn't waste much time, did they?
The eyes...
Half the head is eaten away.
What are you going to do?
Take the head off.
It's no use to me anyway.
It's in the acid.
A few minutes, and there'll be no trace.
Paul, give me a hand with his clothes, will you?
Look at those hands.
Great clodhopping things.
No wonder he was a robber.
With hands like those, he couldn't have been anything else.
Except, perhaps, a gorilla.
I don't think we should continue with this.
We should wait and present our findings at the Federation.
- Should anything go wrong...
- I've got it.
- What?
- Look after things while I'm gone.
Gone where?
If I leave tonight,
I should get back by tomorrow evening.
- Victor!
- Yes, Paul, what is it?
What are you talking about?
Where are you going?
Going?
I'm going away for a little while.
I'll tell you about it when I get back.
Better not touch our friend here while I'm gone. Let him rest in peace...
...while he can.
Let's have some food, I'm hungry.
I thought it was the master.
No, he hasn't come back yet, Justine.
Will he be in time for dinner, sir?
I don't know, he didn't say.
There he is now, sir.
Good evening, Baron Frankenstein is expecting me. May I come in?
I shall need some assistance with my luggage.
- Luggage?
- Yes, I'm coming to stay.
Well, I'm sorry, miss, but the Baron told no one of this.
But he must have done.
I wrote him some weeks ago.
Victor, how happy I am to see you.
I'm afraid there's some mistake.
Mistake?
Didn't you get my letter?
I'm not Victor, I'm Paul Krempe.
Oh, Paul Krempe. I'm so sorry.
- I haven't seen Victor for so long.
- Now that you know who I am...
...why not tell me who you are?
I'm Elizabeth, Victor's cousin.
Didn't he tell you about me?
No, he did not.
For which he will be severely reprimanded when he returns.
- Oh, he's away?
- He's expected back at any moment.
We shan't have long to wait.
Are you going to stay with us long?
I'm coming to live here.
- This is to be my home.
- Live here? But...
Paul, I...
Elizabeth.
Victor.
Elizabeth.
I received your letter.
I was so sorry to hear about your mother.
How are you, my dear?
The maid will show you to your room.
Paul, come see what I've got.
Elizabeth, we'll see you at dinner.
- Yes, but...
- Paul, come on.
As he said, we will see you at dinner.
Lock the door, Paul.
Come and look at these.
What about these?
Have you ever seen anything so beautiful?
Bardello's hands.
The hands of the world's greatest sculptor.
Where did you get them?
Leipzig. I heard that Bardello died there last week.
- All it needed was a little bribery.
- You realize what this means?
It means that our friend will have the finest hands any man ever possessed.
I mean your cousin's arrival.
We can't continue with this experiment.
Not here, anyway.
- What are you talking about?
- Elizabeth. She might find out.
What if she does? Where's the harm?
She's young, Victor.
Her mind would be incapable of receiving such a shock.
All right! You can't see the horror of what you're doing.
At first I was blind to it.
And now?
While you were away, I decided
I could not continue with this experiment.
I hope I can convince you I'm right, change your mind, too.
You'll never do that, Paul.
In six months, you'll rejoice in the fact...
...you helped make this discovery.
You'll be as famous as I.
No, Victor. Infamous!
I will not help you, not anymore.
I beseech you.
Give this up, if not for your own sake, for the sake of the girl.
You're wasting your time, Paul.
Help me graft these hands on.
I want to see if they take.
Can't you understand?
I will not help you anymore.
And I shall try to make Elizabeth leave here.
Elizabeth won't leave, Paul.
If you're really not going to help me,
I'd be glad if you'd leave me alone.
I have work to do.
I shan't be down for dinner.
Make my excuses to Elizabeth, will you?
- Will you require anything else?
- No, thank you, that will be all.
Very well, sir.
I shall take the master's dinner up now.
Leave it outside the door.
Of course, Herr Krempe, I always do.
Do you take your coffee black or white, Paul?
Elizabeth, I don't know you very well, but I want you to do something for me.
Yes?
Leave here.
Leave?
Leave this house at once, and never come back.
That's impossible. Why do you ask it?
I can't explain, but it will not be safe here.
Not safe?
Victor will be here, won't he?
- Oh, yes. Victor will be here.
- Then I fail to see...
It's because of Victor that I'm asking you to leave.
He's conducting experiments which could be very dangerous.
What sort of experiments?
- You wouldn't understand.
- I would understand, I'm sure.
Please, tell me.
Believe me, I can't tell you,
I would if I could.
Then I shall have to ask Victor.
If I'm to marry him, then I have a right to know.
Marry?
Of course, we're engaged.
Didn't he tell you?
How can you be engaged to someone you don't even know?
It was an arrangement between Victor and my mother.
That's absurd. You can't be expected to honor an arrangement of that sort.
My mother and I were entirely dependent upon Victor.
We'd have starved without him.
Now, perhaps, you understand.
I understand you're confusing gratitude with affection.
You have no right to speak to me like that.
How dare you!
I'm sorry. It's entirely your own affair and nothing to do with me.
I still think you should leave.
Believe me, it's for your own good.
Really, Paul, I can't imagine why you make this idiotic request.
It is not a request.
It's a demand. You must not stay here.
Perhaps we should let Victor decide that.
After all, it is his house.
Or had you forgotten?
No, I haven't forgotten.
I'm sorry. Perhaps I shouldn't have spoken to you like this.
I'm sorry, too.
I lost my temper. Please, forgive me.
Really, Paul...
...just because it was arranged years ago...
...that's no reason for my not marrying Victor.
It has always been my dearest wish.
His, too.
Victor...
- How many times have I told you?
- Baron, then.
- Herr Baron.
- That's better.
How much longer is this to go on?
Meeting like this in dark corridors.
Making love in secret.
When are you going to marry me?
What makes you so sure that I'll marry you?
Because you promised.
And because of this.
Herr Baron Victor...
...this woman...
...what is she doing here?
- Are you jealous?
- No.
Yes.
Yes, I am jealous.
She's not your mistress?
- Lf I thought she was...
- On the contrary, Justine.
She's to be your mistress.
It will be your duty to serve my cousin Elizabeth.
And see to her every need as thoroughly as you have mine.
- In a different way of course.
- Of course.
Victor, you're not going away again, are you?
I'm afraid I must.
I'll be back tomorrow evening.
Why, Elizabeth...
...what's the matter?
I'm disappointed.
I see so little of you these days.
And there are the household accounts.
You should check them with me.
They'll soon be your department, and I'm sure you'll handle them well.
But I'd like you to see them.
I'd like your assistance with them.
Soon you'll be asking to help me with my experiments.
But I would. I'd like that more than anything in the world.
Who knows, my dear, perhaps you will.
One day.
I have to go. I have some materials to buy.
Materials for my work.
Well?
- Here you are, sir.
- Careful, man.
Not often we get them perfect in here, sir.
Eyes are generally the first to go.
What do you think, sir?
They'll do.
Ten we said, didn't we?
- Each.
- The pair.
The pair. Just like you said.
- Who is it?
- Paul.
I'm just coming.
Come in, Paul.
You wanted to see me?
It's been a long time since you've been up here. Why is that?
- You know you're always welcome.
- I told you I would not help you.
In that case, why do you continue to live here?
Of course, it's Elizabeth you're worried about, isn't it?
What is it you want?
Haven't you found it difficult keeping away...
...just guessing what I was doing?
Never knowing how well I was getting on?
I've decided to let you see my progress.
Then you can judge for yourself whether I shall succeed or not.
I'm at the last stage but one, come and see.
- What do you think?
- It's horrible!
Paul, the features are not important.
What matters is I'm creating a being that will live and breathe.
Once the scars on the face heal, it won't look so bad.
Victor, I appeal to you.
Stop what you're doing before it's too late.
What am I doing?
I'm harming nobody.
Just robbing a few graves.
What doctor or scientist doesn't?
How else can we learn the complexities of the human animal?
Doctors rob for the eventual good of mankind.
This can never end in anything but evil.
Why do you say that?
I admit he isn't a particularly good-Iooking specimen at present.
One's facial character is built up by what lies behind it...
...in the brain.
A benevolent mind, and the face assumes the patterns of benevolence.
An evil mind, then an evil face. For this...
...the brain of a genius will be used.
When that brain starts to function within the frame...
...then the face and features will assume wisdom and understanding.
I told you I was at the last stage but one: The brain.
A brain of superior intellect.
A lifetime of knowledge already behind it.
Imagine that.
My creature will be born with a lifetime of knowledge.
Where is this brain to come from?
I'll get it.
- Now, Professor.
- Lhr or dir.
Your hospitality is too generous, my dear Baron.
On the contrary, Professor Bernstein, it is we who are in your debt.
When Victor told me you could come,
I was overjoyed.
You honor me, Miss Elizabeth.
Not only overjoyed because you were to stay with us, but because...
...your presence at dinner tonight would ensure my Victor's presence.
Elizabeth thinks I spend too much time in my laboratory.
He's locked in there for hours, Professor.
He doesn't eat and he doesn't sleep.
I, for one, think the world would be a far better place without research.
At least, my world would be.
She may be right, Baron.
One can spend too much of one's life locked in stuffy rooms...
...seeking out obscure truths.
Searching, researching...
...until one is too old to enjoy life.
Victor, the Professor is on my side.
You've failed me, Professor.
Elizabeth will be quoting you when she wants me to leave my work...
...and idle away the time with her.
Indeed, you shall.
I'll say, "Victor, you are only a little scientist. I shan't listen to you.
"On the authority of the greatest brain in Europe, leave your laboratory...
"...and come out into the sunshine with me."
Women, Professor. How cleverly they twist our words to suit their own ends.
She'll only be happy if I give up my work entirely.
Is the world ready for the revelation you scientists make?
There's a great difference between knowing a thing is so...
...and knowing how to use that knowledge for the good of mankind.
The trouble with us scientists is...
...we quickly tire of our discoveries.
We hand them over to people who are not ready for them...
...while we go off again into the darkness of ignorance...
...searching for other discoveries...
...which will be mishandled in the same way when the time comes.
It's not as bad as that, surely.
Would you have us give up research, too?
Good evening.
Paul, I'm so glad you arrived in time to meet Professor Bernstein.
Professor Bernstein?
Yes, indeed.
May I introduce my friend Paul Krempe.
- Good evening, sir.
- How do you do?
The Professor is staying with us tonight.
I'm proud to meet you. I had no idea such an honor awaited my return.
We didn't expect you until the morning.
I thought it best to come back.
I've heard a great deal about you from Baron Frankenstein.
I look forward to a talk with you in the morning.
I shall be delighted.
- We've exhausted the Professor.
- No, no.
I have enjoyed every minute of this delightful evening.
But old age comes not alone.
Good night, young lady.
Good night, Professor.
I trust that you will sleep well.
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.
- I'll show you to your room.
- Thank you.
I really am most honored to have you here, sir.
I'm most grateful to you, my boy.
You know, I'm alone in the world.
And to be guest in someone's home, especially...
...such a charming home like this with such a wonderful atmosphere...
...it's very precious to me.
You are too kind, sir.
I'd like to show you a painting just before you retire.
It's this one at the top of the staircase.
It was purchased by my father and illustrates one of the early operations.
If you step back a little, you'll see it better.
Look out, Professor! Look out!
Baron Frankenstein...
...I'm sure I'm expressing the feelings of all of us...
...when I say how much we appreciate your kindness and consideration...
...in allowing the body of our poor colleague...
...to find its last resting place in your family vault.
As you know,
Professor Bernstein had no living relatives.
It was the least I could do.
He was a guest in my house.
I thought I'd find you here.
That was very intelligent of you.
Now that you've found me, what do you want?
You killed the old man, didn't you?
And now you're mutilating his body.
Mutilating? I've removed his brain.
Mutilating has nothing to do with it.
I can't prove you murdered him, but I can stop you using his brain.
Why? He has no further use for it.
- Give me that!
- Don't be a fool! Be careful!
You'll damage it!
Get away from here, leave me alone!
Get out of here!
If you've damaged it...
Who is it?
What's the matter, Paul?
I've come to appeal to you to leave here.
- What are you talking about? Leave here?
- Now.
This very minute. Before it's too late.
Paul, we've been through all this before.
Won't you understand you're in real danger?
What Victor is doing is dangerous to everyone.
Then why do you stay here?
You're not helping him any longer.
I'll tell you why I stay here.
I will not leave you alone in this house with him.
Believe me, Paul. You're wrong about him.
Am I?
- You must be.
- How do you know?
Have you ever been in that laboratory of his? No.
You cannot possibly conceive the dreadful thing he's proposing to do.
What are you trying to tell me?
That Victor is wicked, insane?
Neither wicked nor insane.
Just so dedicated to his work...
...he can't see the terrible consequences that could result.
Elizabeth...
...I can't bear the thought of any harm to you.
I'd do anything to avoid hurt to you both, but...
...Victor is so wrapped up in his experiments...
Paul, please.
Please, leave me.
I want you to help me.
You must be mad.
That apparatus was constructed for dual operation. You know that.
I thought I could work it myself, but I can't.
I'm delighted.
That means your experiment will not succeed.
You're going to help me, Paul, whatever you say.
If you help me, once I've proved my theories, I'll dispose of this creature.
- How long will that take?
- A month, two at the outside.
And have that thing alive up there? No!
If you don't help me, Paul, then I make no such promise.
Somehow, I'll manage on my own.
However difficult, I'll do it.
And when I have succeeded...
...I'll introduce Elizabeth to science and see how she likes it.
There is nothing more important to me than the success of this experiment.
It's what I've worked for all my life.
All right, Victor.
I'll help you.
Victor!
I did it, Paul.
This thing must be destroyed before it regains consciousness.
Do you hear me, Victor?
- What did you say?
- You must destroy this thing now.
Don't you see? I've succeeded!
Yes, nearly succeeded in getting yourself killed.
- Another 10 seconds and you...
- This is my creation.
Yes, a criminal lunatic. It tried to kill you...
That's the brain.
When you attacked me, it was damaged.
That makes it your fault, Paul.
Your fault that it is not what I intended it to be.
I can repair the brain.
It's what I've done that counts.
I've created a being.
- You promised to destroy it.
- When I've carried out my research.
- Don't you see you've created a monster?
- That doesn't matter.
I shall operate on the brain tomorrow.
It shouldn't take long.
Very well, Victor. Goodbye.
Paul! Paul!
- Paul, he's gone!
- He's what?
I've searched the house.
Heaven knows where he's got to.
It's true, Paul, we must get out and find him!
- I'll go to the village for help.
- No, I'll send word.
We must pick up his trail.
If he gets into the woods, we'll never find him.
I'll meet you downstairs.
Hold on, boy.
You're going too fast for your old grandpa.
You sit here then, Grandpa.
- Where?
- Here.
I'll go on now. It's not far.
Aye, thank you, boy.
- Do be careful, now. Go on.
- Yes, Grandpa.
That was quick.
You can't have picked many.
What's the matter?
Can't you find your way?
I'm here, son.
I've lost my stick. Help me find it, son.
You're quiet. Cat got your tongue?
Who are you?
Tell me who you are.
What do you want with me?
Can't you see I'm only a poor blind man?
I've got nothing for you.
I can't harm you.
Somebody help me! Help me!
Grandpa!
Grandpa!
Look, he must have stopped here.
Where did you tell the villagers to make for?
The south lakeshore. I said we'd meet them there in half an hour.
Well, his trail is easy to follow anyway.
No, Paul!
- You shoot well.
- I've done what had to be done.
- We'll bury him before the villagers arrive.
- They won't arrive.
I didn't send the message.
You madman!
You risked just two of us against that?
- We might've been killed!
- We might. But we weren't.
Now he's dead, so it doesn't matter.
Well, it's done and I hope you're satisfied.
I'm satisfied we were in time to stop this monstrous act before it was too late.
If that's what you mean.
I don't think I shall ever forgive you for what you've done. Ever.
- Who's there?
- It's me. Paul.
Just a minute.
- Well?
- I'm leaving now.
- I shall send for my things in a few days.
- As you wish, Paul.
- Where are you going? What will you do?
- I have no idea.
It is no longer necessary for me to remain here.
What do you mean "necessary"?
Of course, there's Elizabeth.
You stayed to protect her.
You've done what you set out to do.
You can leave with a clear conscience.
I'll give you life again.
- Justine, you can serve dinner.
- Just a minute.
Is it true?
I beg you pardon?
About you marrying that woman?
- Aren't you forgetting yourself?
- You promised to marry me.
I'm not forgetting that.
- So I did.
- Don't you laugh at me.
- Stop it! Stop it or l...
- What?
- What will you do?
- I'll kill you.
You stupid little fool!
- Did you really think I'd marry you?
- You're hurting!
Get back to your work!
But you've got to marry me. You've got to.
I'm going to have a child.
- Since when is this?
- It doesn't matter.
It's true, that's all.
Why choose me as the father?
Pick any man in the village.
The chances are it'll be the right one.
She won't think so. Not when I tell her.
I'll tell her about what you're doing in that laboratory of yours.
And then I'll go to the authorities and tell them.
Tell them what?
I know plenty, if I care to tell.
- What do you know?
- You wouldn't like that, would you?
Well, if you don't marry me, I'll tell.
Tell what?
You know what I'm talking about.
Proof, my dear. That's all the authorities would be interested in.
Proof.
- I want you out by tomorrow morning.
- I'll get proof.
Just you see. I'll get it.
Pass the marmalade, will you, Miss Elizabeth?
Thank you.
Victor?
I'm worried about Justine.
It's a week since she went away, and we still have no word from her.
I told you not to worry.
I expect some village lothario eloped with her.
She always was a romantic little thing.
How are the wedding invitations coming along?
- Had any replies yet?
- Yes, quite a few.
- Victor.
- Yes, my sweet?
I've invited Paul to the wedding. After all, he was your good friend.
I'm sorry if I've done wrongly.
He hasn't accepted yet, so...
...maybe he won't come.
I hope he does come.
There's something I'd like him to see.
To the bride and bridegroom.
To the happy couple.
To the bridesmaids.
- What are you gibbering about?
- I was just rehearsing my speech, my dear.
That's not until tomorrow, after the wedding.
Yes, I know, my dear, but these things take time.
Come on. We're going home.
So soon?
Come on.
Thank heavens they're gone.
I have work to do upstairs.
But this is our wedding eve. I thought...
Oh, come, Elizabeth.
We are not sentimental young lovers.
Can I come and watch you working in your laboratory?
No, my dear. Not yet.
But one day very soon.
I promise you.
It's a pity Paul didn't come.
Leave those for the morning, Ellen.
Yes, Miss Elizabeth.
Good evening. I'm Herr Krempe.
Are the Baron and Miss Elizabeth at home?
- Yes.
- Paul!
- Paul, how marvelous to see you!
- Elizabeth!
- We thought you weren't coming.
- You look wonderful!
- And Victor?
- He is in his laboratory.
He's been almost living there for the past few weeks.
- What's he doing?
- As if I should know.
I'll never know what goes on behind that locked laboratory door.
Of course, I forgot.
He'll be pleased to see you, because he said yesterday...
...that he wished you were here because he has something he wants you to see.
- Has he?
- Why don't you go and surprise him?
I will.
- Who's there?
- Paul.
Paul?
Paul.
Still keeping the door locked.
Is that necessary?
You can judge for yourself in a moment.
Elizabeth said you had something to show me.
Yes.
Yes, Paul, I have.
I've started on brain surgery, Paul.
Nothing to say?
- So it wasn't killed.
- Oh, it was.
At least, life had passed from its body.
But don't forget...
...I put it there in the first place.
It was easy to restore.
Wait, Paul.
I want to show you something else.
- I've seen enough.
- Wait, Paul!
Watch this.
Get up!
Come on, get up!
That's right.
Now come here.
Come on now.
Come here!
Sit.
Sit down.
Sit down!
Is this your creature of superior intellect?
Your perfect physical being, this animal!
Ask it a question of advanced physics.
It's got a brain with a lifetime of knowledge, it should find it simple.
Shall I tell you something, Paul?
There you see the result of your handiwork as much as mine.
Oh, yes. I gave him life.
I put a brain in his head.
I chose a good brain, a brilliant one.
But you damaged it.
You put a bullet in the wretched thing.
This is your fault, Paul.
Do you understand that?
Your fault.
Yes, I understand.
But you won't win, Paul.
Shall I tell you why you won't win?
Because I shall carry on.
If I can't cure it by brain surgery, then I'll get another brain.
And another. And another.
No. No, you will not.
Paul, what are you going to do?
Paul, what are you going to do?
For your sake, and to protect Elizabeth,
I've so far kept silent.
Now I shall go to the authorities and have them destroy that creature.
- And see that you pay for these atrocities.
- No!
Paul, where are you going?
Paul, wait a minute!
What are you going to gain by this?
- You're as much a part of it as I.
- I've had nothing to do with it for months.
I've got something to say.
Who's there?
I warn you: If you tell the authorities,
Elizabeth will be the first to suffer.
Victor! On the roof.
- We must go up there.
- Not this time, I'm going for help.
Elizabeth! Come back!
Get back! Get back!
No! No!
Get away from me!
My life's work destroyed.
Destroyed in a moment.
By the same hand that gave it life.
Within half an hour there was nothing left of him.
And that is my story.
That is what happened.
You don't believe me, do you?
You must believe me. Do you hear?
A visitor for you, Frankenstein:
Herr Krempe. Will you see him?
Oh, yes! I knew Paul wouldn't fail me.
He'll tell you it's true. He knows.
He'll tell you it's true!
All right, he'll see you.
I knew Paul wouldn't fail me.
He's been a good friend.
He'll prove everything I said is true.
He knows.
My dear friend, Paul!
Paul!
Paul, my friend, tell them, Paul.
- Tell them what, Victor?
- About him. About the creature I made.
Tell them. You were the only person to see him apart from myself and Justine.
The girl you murdered.
But I didn't. That's what I've been saying.
It was him.
- He did it.
- Who?
- Who did it, Victor?
- The creature I made.
You know. The man. Tell them.
Oh, no! No, Paul!
Paul, you must tell them.
You know what's going to happen.
Only you can save me.
You must tell them.
Paul, I'll make you! I'll make you!
Paul, you must tell them! Paul!
You must tell them. Paul!
I'm sorry, Paul, but you must tell them.
You must save me, Paul.
You've got to save me!
No!
Paul!
There is nothing we can do for him now.
Come on, I'll take you home.

PECKATSWE
Cradled within the arms of the rivers Ganges and Branmaputra to the south...
... and the mysterious plateau of Tibet to the north...
... majestically stands the mightiest mountain range on the face of the earth.
The Himalayas.
This is the story of an expedition to this rugged barrier.
Not to settle on its windswept towering heights...
... but to find and study plant life...
... which had heretofore been unknown or inaccessible.
This is the story of that mission.
Of how a small group of people found themselves in pursuit of a crude and primitive civilization...
... which once only existed as a figment of the imagination.
Starting from Los Angeles, California...
... and after careful study of the region...
... the first leg of the expedition took me to Bombay, India.
From there I proceeded to the town of Shekar...
... the last settlement before entering the wilderness of rock and ice.
There I selected Sherpa natives to serve as porters.
My name is Parrish.
Dr. Frank Parrish.
By profession, I am a botanist, working for the Corey Foundation.
To record the visual log of our expedition,
I engaged Peter Wells...
... well-qualified to serve as a photographer.
As our guide, I hired Subra, the only English- speaking Sherpa acquainted with the terrain.
Only the most essential equipment was selected and distributed among the members of our party.
All preparations completed and everything on schedule...
... at noon on June 14th, we set out to strike at the mountain.
Subra's young wife Tala and his brother
Leva accompanied us to the foot of the mountain...
... before saying goodbye.
The first days were uneventful, monotonous and tedious.
But as we moved onto higher regions, the terrain became more rugged and difficult.
Wells and I kept up with the Sherpas...
... who were much like human mules under the weight of our heavy supplies.
We continued on to a height of ten thousand feet above sea level...
... where I wanted to commence my work.
At last came the day we reached the plateau region.
Subra, have your men pitch the tents.
Up to this point, having established only temporary camps...
... everyone was eager for our first hot meal.
Camp One was now well-established.
Except for a variety of common moths and crucifer flower...
... we found little of interest.
But we decided to comb the area more thoroughly for the next few days.
How about a shot?
No, thanks.
Excuse me, Mr. Doctor. Everything alright?
Everything's fine, Subra. Thank you.
Alcohol good?
It's fine.
Here, help yourself.
- Thank you, Mr. Doctor Wells.
- I'm no doctor.
Want anything?
No, thank you, Subra. I'll see you later.
I fix nice hot supper.
A wonderful tonic. It warms up the gizzards.
You'll find out when you pickle your gizzard.
Wells, I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't hand out that stuff to any of the men and...
Don't drink in their presence, understand?
Okay. Suits me.
Shekar, come in.
Come in, Shekar.
It's Dr. Parrish.
This is Shekar. Yes, doctor.
Let me speak to an Inspector Karma, please.
Will get Inspector Karma.
That night all seemed well in the town of Shekar.
Mr. Doctor.
Mr. Doctor!
Oh, Subra, what is it?
Yeti. Yeti, Mr. Doctor.
- Yeti!
- What's all the noise?
It's my brother Leva. He come with four men.
They've followed us all the way up here?
What do they want?
Brother say Yeti steal my woman, Tala.
- We need go after Yeti.
- Yeti, Yeti, what is this?
Yeti, creature of snow. Snow giant!
Oh, you mean the abominable snowman, the phantom of the Himalayas.
Marauder of women.
We go after Yeti, find him.
Oh, the newspapers and magazines have carried stories about it from time to time.
Yeah, the Sherpas have built this creature into a horror story.
This isn't a hunting party. Thousands of dollars have been spent to finance this expedition.
And he wants to chase a legend.
- Mr. Doctor, Yeti real, Mr. Doctor.
- No one's ever seen one.
Oh, I know people have brought back stories about these semi-humans.
Oh, the whole thing sounds fantastic.
Let us leave. Yeti steal Tala!
I'm sorry, Subra. Have your brother and his men join us if they want to.
But we have other work to do.
Because of my decision, I felt that Subra resented and disliked me.
What do you think's going on out there?
Well, it sounds like Subra trying to be very important.
I better find out.
Subra!
Subra!
Well?
I don't know what they're up to.
What do you mean?
Subra, I want to talk to you.
Talk.
What's the meaning of this? I gave no order to break camp.
- We move.
- I'll tell you when to move.
We move now.
Subra, what's come over you?
You sent some of our men away, didn't you?
Only four of our men.
Other four belong Brother Leva.
I'm concerned with our men. Now get them back!
They look this side of mountain.
We look the other side.
For Yeti.
I'll shoot any man who doesn't obey.
You no can shoot.
Empty! They've taken our cartridges!
Subra, this is mutiny.
Subra take guns.
Alright. Where do you intend to look for this creature?
Everybody look rocky valley legend.
Why, that's ridiculous.
This party's not equipped for that kind of thing.
Subra no care.
Well, you might as well let them go.
There's no point in our following them along.
We might as well go back.
- Turn back?
- No can find the way.
We move now.
Well, I think I need a drink.
Yeah, you'll need more than that.
Wait a minute.
Forgot about the radio.
By Jove, that's an idea.
Get packed! We move right away.
Come on. Come on!
Whether Wells and I liked it or not, we had no alternative but to follow along.
Take it easy, Wells.
Wait a minute.
Did you hear something?
No, it's just the ruddy wind.
I think this is it.
Give me some light.
Oh, it's my Scotch!
Nevermind that now.
There it is.
Let's hope they haven't been monkeying with it.
It looks alright.
Wait a minute.
It's okay. Go ahead.
Shekar, come in.
Come in, Shekar.
Shekar, come in.
Shekar, come in.
Subra!
Subra only want to kill radio machine.
Where is Scotch?
- No, wait a minute. That's my personal property!
- Take it easy, Wells!
Subra like alcohol.
Mr. Doctor, get out, go sleep now.
- Big walk tomorrow.
- If you do --
Take it easy, you two. Come on.
Come on!
Well...
No radio, no nothing.
I'll get it to work.
- We'll get the Shekar police.
- Oh, I hope so.
Wells, have yourself a nightcap.
I'll be right back.
Oh, thanks, old boy. I will.
I found that the radio could be repaired.
Wells' case of Scotch gave me an idea.
What was that?
I didn't hear anything.
There it is again.
Oh, it's just the wind.
The altitude's getting on your nerves.
My nerves are alright.
I better take a look.
We move now!
Don't you think you had enough last night?
Come on!
Mr. Doctor, we leave now.
The Yeti. Yeti go up there.
We track, follow steps.
Subra, aren't you forgetting something?
No want men to have radio machine.
It's dead.
Lost the trail.
Yeti no stop here. We go up.
Even Subra could not fight the darkness.
At sundown, he ordered the men to make camp.
I still think it was a pretty mean trick...
... leaving my tonic behind.
The tubes were alright, but the wires are broken.
Oh, now you find out, after depriving me of my...
Wait a minute!
Alright, go ahead.
He's dead.
I couldn't rest.
A legend, the abduction of Subra's wife...
... the footprints...
... the death of a native.
All these things began to fall into a mysterious pattern.
It looks like it's over.
We were lucky!
I'll say we were.
We rest here.
You know... this altitude's beginning to get me.
 We're getting pretty high up.
We'll probably be needing oxygen soon.
Storm come. Need to find shelter.
Sky dark.
Look over there.
Cave.
How long will it take us to get down there?
One hour.
Maybe two.
Lucky thing for us we found this place.
Yeah, it would've been impossible in the tents with this weather.
Subra.
Yes?
Come here a minute.
You know, you could be a very famous man.
- Oh, yes?
- Yeah.
If we did find this Yeti and brought him back to America alive.
Sir, we only want to kill Yeti.
Suppose you did kill one.
How would you know it's the one you're after?
If there's one Yeti, there must be a whole civilization, or a whole tribe of them.
So we kill all Yeti. Subra no care.
Well, how far up do you intend to go?
To the top of Everest or Anapurna?
Maybe yes.
Where are these creatures?
Why has no one ever seen one?
Yeti, him hide when smell human.
But Yeti come low country when want to steal woman.
Always want to steal woman.
We go until we find Yeti.
I think we go sleep now.
Move over, McDuff.
It's too bad.
What's too bad?
I tried to get to that radio, but it's in one of the Sherpa's packs.
Well, we'll just have to wait until we see a better opportunity.
Yeah.
Right now, I'm going to forget it and go to bed.
What is it, Subra?
This gold collar, my woman.
Tala!
Tala!
Yeti bring Tala here.
We go find Tala!
Tala!
I realized that the snow creature was not just a legend.
I consoled myself to the thought that finding one...
... would more than compensate for my failure as a botanist.
Subra was a man possessed.
He split the party, ordering the men to search the tunnels.
And to meet at the entrance to the cave.
Tala!
You know, this place gives me the creeps.
Well, it's not the most cheerful place in the world.
It's only an animal of some kind.
Subra!
What is it?
Let's go.
Yeti!
No!
Tala! Tala!
He's only stunned.
He's not dead.
Alright, give me that.
Now give him a highboard to keep him quiet.
Get a tarpaulin. We'll carry him in that.
Go on.
We found that the female and child of the snow creature had been killed by the cave-in.
We held Subra and led him at gunpoint.
And ordered them to carry the creature back to the entrance of the cave...
... to meet the rest of the Sherpas.
Subra, tell your men to put up their hands.
Wells, get that gun.
One false move and I'll shoot.
Tell that man to put the radio down.
I'll try to get the check on police.
Unable to establish contact with Shekar, we started down...
... determined to bring the creature back alive.
Wells and I took turns watching to make certain that nothing went wrong.
Wells, get the highboard!
We managed to keep the creature in a semi-conscious state...
... allowing him to come to only enough to take food.
So on the fifth day, we reached the lowland region.
On the seventh day, as we were nearing the town of Shekar...
... I decided to herd the natives straight to the police.
Corey Foundation, Los Angeles, California.
Right. Whom did you wish to speak with?
Mr. Corey Jr.
Corey Jr.
As I said, your foundation was granted permission to explore the Himalayas.
Your discovery is of a very unusual nature.
But it belongs to you, and you are free to do with it as you wish.
The inspector kept repeating how friendly his country was...
... and how it welcomed scientists, explorers, and so on.
I'm sure you will accept my government's apologies.
And the natives will be held in custody here for taking the law into their own hands.
Well, thank you.
By the way, can I keep the creature here until I can arrange for his transportation?
- Of course.
- Of course, he'll have to be fed.
And could you give him an injection every six hours?
Yes. We shall do that.
Oh, by the way, your guide wishes to speak with you.
- Subra?
- Yes.
Well, send him in.
- Mr. Doctor.
- Subra!
Subra no understand law. No can say.
If this Yeti steal my woman, nobody know.
Inspector Karma, I won't prefer charges against these people.
- Thank you, Mr. Doctor. Thank you!
- Oh, forget it, forget it.
Your telephone call. Will you take it in the next room?
Oh, fine. Come on, Wells.
Yes, that's the idea.
And please send the refrigerator unit as quickly as possible.
Fine, fine.
I'm leaving for Bombay immediately to take care of all the arrangements.
You can reach me there, let's see...
In care of the TWA office.
Well, good.
Oh, would you please call my wife and tell her I'll be home soon?
Good, thank you.
They're sending us a refrigerator unit to transport the creature in.
An air-conditioned affair.
What's the matter with you?
Well, I don't like this whole thing.
What do you mean?
Well, it's just this.
I could get two or three thousand pounds for that photograph I took.
And we should split that money between us.
As far as the creature's concerned, well, we should sell him and then --
The photograph, do what you want with it.
As for the creature, he's going to the Corey Foundation, where he belongs.
You've just got no business sense.
An opportunity like this comes once in a lifetime and you don't --
Did your telephone call come out alright?
Oh, yes, thank you. Clear as a bell.
I have to leave for Bombay right away, but I'll be back in a few days.
Would you see that nobody comes near the creature? Including Mr. Wells.
According to this cable, your temperature- controlled unit...
... should be here on our cargo flight at 8:40 this evening.
Now, the cable says to handle it with the utmost care.
Yes, it's very delicate.
We'll have to rush it to Shekar.
I've already made all the arrangements to send it and the documents to you.
And we'll take care of all other formalities.
Thank you very much.
We followed your instructions.
The injections worked fine.
Here he is.
Thank you.
Let's see. The base unit will keep the mortar running en route.
This is the temperature control.
And the self-contained oxygen unit.
Food traps.
Oh, yes, the food trap.
You old Americans!
Manufacturing a contraption like this on a phone call.
Well, I better get going.
Thank you very much, Inspector Karma.
Have a good trip back to California.
Hello, Frank!
Darling!
Hello, Mr. Corey. Glad to see you. How are you?
Well, instead of flowers, I brought you a Yeti.
That's what the natives call him.
Well, where is he now?
Well, he should be here. I sent him ahead on a cargo plane.
- Really?
- Which one of you is Dr. Parrish?
I am.
Hold onto the pretty girl, doctor, and give us a big smile.
- Thank you.
- I'm from The Chronicle, doctor.
Well, just a minute. I just got here.
I haven't even talked to my wife!
Now, gentlemen, you can reach Dr. Parrish at the foundation later.
'Dr. Frank Parrish, Dr. Frank Parrish.'
'Please report to the Customs warehouse.'
- Which way is it?
- Well, it's easy enough to find out. Come on.
Excuse me, gentlemen. I'll talk to you later.
Well, there it is, darling.
Mr. Corey, what do you think of it?
Amazing! Absolutely amazing!
I see where you classify your import as a snow creature.
That's right.
Well, it's necessary that we clarify its immigration status.
Immigration status?
I don't understand.
Well, the question is, is it a beast or a man?
Well, he's not human if that's what you mean.
- Do you know Mr. Peter Wells?
- Why, yes, he's my photographer.
This article came to our attention.
Mr. Wells refers to your discovery as a 'snow man'.
Well, that's ridiculous!
Wells is a photographer. He's reaching for sensational
This creature is definitely not human.
Mr. Fleet, certainly your department isn't going to take this photographer's work literally!
Well, this is a very unusual case.
This is a very unusual find.
Do you realize what this means to science?
That's why our department was interested enough to contact a prominent anthropologist...
... Dr. Louis Dupont.
Dr. Dupont?
Of course. I've heard of him. He should be well-qualified to substantiate Dr. Parrish.
Unfortunately, he can't be here til seven o'clock tonight.
You all be in my office at seven o'clock.
Of course.
This will have to stay in the warehouse until then.
We've studied the instructions on the refrigerator
It will be properly connected.
Well, I guess it will just have to wait.
We'll see you at seven.
Come on, darling.
What an unusual specimen!
The department's main interest is to classify this specimen, as you call it, as not being human.
- Dr. Parrish!
- Yes, may I?
- Of course.
- I'm a little early.
Well, that's alright. Dr. Parrish, Dr. Dupont.
- Oh, how do you do?
- How do you do, doctor?
- Has Mr. Corey been here?
- Not yet.
- Won't you sit down?
- Why, thank you.
- Cigarette?
- Thank you.
What an unusual find for a botanist to make!
Yes, it is.
And you say you also saw a female?
And a child?
That's right.
Have you seen the specimen I brought back?
No, not yet.
Well, we will as soon as Mr. Corey arrives.
He called and he should be here any minute.
I have said this creature is not human.
I didn't say he was.
I have to determine whether his brain is a calculating brain.
And from that, narrow down all the theories.
We must have one definite classification.
From what we know of, shall I say, these snow creatures, they have been a legend!
We have seen abstract drawings and heard stories of these nomads, but...
... they were always associated with human traits!
Excuse me.
Fleet speaking.
What? How?
We'll be right over.
- The creature has escaped.
- What?
Let's get over to the warehouse.
He started to move in that thing, then he started to shake it, and it fell.
He got out and I started to run for my life.
A sight I'll never forget.
He come at me and I --
Mr. Fleet?
- I'm Mr. Fleet.
- I'm Lieutenant Dunbar, Police.
This is Dr. Dupont, this is Dr. Parrish.
What's this all about?
You'll have to give us a description.
- Right.
- Where's the phone?
Right over there.
Come on, doctor. You can give it to the department firsthand.
That's all, Evans. Send it out right away.
Would you come with me a moment, doctor?
Certainly.
- Quite extraordinary, doctor.
- Right.
'Car 61. Come in, Lieutenant Dunbar.'
'Car 61. Come in, Lieutenant Dunbar.'
Dunbar, go ahead.
'Body of a girl found in the alley back of
1220 Coe Street.'
'Repeat. In alley back of 1220 Coe Street. Over.'
Got it. Out.
- You hear that, doctor?
- I better come along.
- I think you'd better.
- Oh, Mr. Fleet!
When Mr. Corey gets here, brief him on everything, will you?
I'll see you later!
- Hello, Lieutenant.
- What you doing, Richards?
I thought you were through for the day.
Looked that way, didn't it?
- Any news from my wife?
- Not yet. Mother-in-law's still with her.
Something wrong?
My wife and I are having a baby, that's all.
Oh, is that all?
This way.
Oh, thank you Charly.
Now, let's see.
This is the warehouse.
Over there's Coe Street, where the girl was killed.
The distance from here to here is about three miles.
Yeah, go on.
Well, it's strange to me that nobody reported seeing him...
... from the time he left the warehouse til he arrived at Coe Street.
It was late. Hardly anybody on the street.
I guess so.
He's got to be stopped.
Stopped, Lieutenant, but not killed.
Is there something else you can tell us about him, doctor?
His mentality, his habits, something?
Well, he's acclimated to a high altitude, low temperature.
We know all that.
Send out this bulletin to all radio stations and newspapers.
Tell everyone to stay off the streets and remain calm.
That goes for everybody.
Right.
Well, what do we do now?
There's nothing we can do, except wait for him to show up again.
'Attention all citizens. This is an urgent public service bulletin from your police department.'
'A dangerous killer beast is at large.'
'You are asked to remain indoors.'
'This is an urgent public service bulletin to all citizens.'
'A dangerous killer beast is at large.'
Don't! Don't! Don't do it, please!
- Don't.
- Now get out of here!
Please. You don't understand.
Give me a chance to explain, please.
- I'm sick of listening to your words.
- But please!
Now you stay away from me. And if I never see you again, it'll be too soon!
- Now get out of here!
- But --
Got it. Who's on the job?
Right.
He showed up again.
- Where?
He chased a girl, near an all-night pharmacy.
Let's see. He started here.
Then he appeared here.
And now, right here, the pharmacy. He's got to be within that triangle.
Instruct all units in Sectors 15 and 16 to converge at Area 11.
Right.
How about some more coffee, doctor?
Yeah, yeah.
Charlie, you got any more coffee?
Police!
Help! Police!
Why don't you go to bed?
It's getting very late.
Okay, I'll try to check with you later.
Goodbye, dear.
Thanks, Lieutenant.
Now, what's the matter?
Now you've got two reasons to face the coroner.
Yes?
But that's impossible! We've got that whole areas swarming with men!
Are you sure?
Right.
What is it? What happened?
This whole thing is cockeyed!
These are the three areas.
Logically then, the force should be in here.
But it isn't! He was just spotted at a meat-packing house, way out here.
Well, how did he get out of that area?
It's been covered by the police.
That's the sixty-four dollar question.
It's a distance of almost seven miles.
And nobody's seen him from there to there.
That's right.
Only two ways that this thing could get around.
Walking and flying, and he hasn't got wings.
Any normal person would hide out at a hotel or anyplace.
This is a white elephant. Any three-year-old child could spot him.
The question is, how does he cover seven miles without being seen?
Just an idea, Lieutenant, but I think
I've got something.
What is it?
- Storm drains.
- I don't get it.
Some of those openings are big enough for two men to crawl into.
You mean the catch basins?
I think you've got something there, doctor.
Get me the city engineer at his home.
What's the guy's name? Edwards, that's it. Edwards.
Department of Public Works is right around the corner.
So wake him up.
The drains in the sewer system of the city are a lot cooler than the external temperature.
I told you the creature had intuitive powers.
He could have sensed the colder temperature.
And that would explain why he was never seen from jump to jump.
Do you have a complete chart of the storm drains?
Lieutenant, there are forty-eight hundred miles of storm drains under this city.
We've got lots of charts.
How about the east end?
Yeah.
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks.
You know, doctor, if there are drains connecting these areas, we've got something to work on.
There we are, Lieutenant.
That's the area, right there.
Here are the stops, doctor, right along the drain lines.
- Can I take this with me?
- Yes.
Thanks, Edwards.
- Sorry to wake you.
- Oh, that's alright, Lieutenant.
Think nothing of it. Anything for the police department.
- ... looking out...
- Richards, get eight men. Issue the works.
Walkie-talkies, lamps, rubber boots, and so on.
Right, Lieutenant.
The first detail, we'll start here at Eleventh and Grand, near the warehouse.
The second at Coe Street, where the girl was found.
Coe.
Dr. Parrish, myself, and a couple officers will start here at the pharmacy.
The first detail will work to the north, second to the south...
... and we work eastward.
Plan within the hour that we should all meet right here.
- Got it?
- Check.
- Hurry it up.
- Alright, darling.
- Oh, Lieutenant, can we take a net along?
- Sure. Hey, Richards!
- Get a big net and some poles to go with it.
- Right.
And leave word where I'll be in case the hospital calls.
Yes, Lieutenant.
Let's go.
Just a minute.
Lynch?
- Lynch?
- 'Yes, Lieutenant.'
Can you make out anything?
'Not yet, Lieutenant.'
'Proceeding south, according to plan. Over.'
How about you, Roberts?
Anything happen at your end?
'Not yet, Lieutenant.'
Stay in contact.
Thanks to them for bringing the net.
We haven't got him yet, doctor.
Hold it!
Let me check this.
I never noticed that tunnel over there before.
It intersects this drain and empties into the main drain center.
You two take it.
We'll go this way.
There he is!
Look out!
He went up the tunnel a little bit.
Seems to be alright.
Now that we know he's in here, let's see where this tunnel leads to.
Let's see. We're at East Entrance 7.
It winds around and comes out
East Entrance 8.
We'll have them put the net up at East Entrance 8.
Right.
Lynch...
- Lynch!
- That you, Lieutenant?
Put the net up over East Entrance 8.
- Will do, Lieutenant.
- Right.
Loosen his collar and take him out into the main tunnel.
Nice shot, boy.
- We'll do as you say, doctor.
- Yeah.
I'll have Dr. Dupont give you instructions where to send the body.
'Come in, Car 61.'
Stand by.
- 'That you, Lieutenant?'
- Yeah, we just finished the job. What is it?
'Very urgent call. Proceed immediately to Crescent and Elm. Urgent. Over.'
Who gave that order?
Don't you know what time it is?
'I don't know, but there's a creature waiting for you.'
'Eight pounds, three ounces. A boy, Lieutenant.'
'Mother and son are doing fine.'
'Congratulations, Pop.'
Thanks a lot, Vince. Thanks a lot.
Thank you. Out.
Well, I guess that's it. Good luck.
- I guess I'd better be going.
- I guess you had!
Come on, doctor, I'll drop you off on the way.
Oh, no, no. You haven't got time.
Sure, I have. Come on.
Alright. My wife must be pretty worried by now.
Say, doctor. What's your first name?
Frank.
Maybe I'll name my kid Frank.
Frank Dunbar, it sounds great.
Thanks.
I don't know. I'm not too sure I like it.
What's that?
- Sounds like a jet, doesn't it?
- That's not jet.
Maggie!  Look!
- What is it?
- Down!  Get down.
Maggie!
Get inside, inside!
Inside!
Maggie!
I'm alright, Dad.
We saw it coming out of the sky, it was brilliant...
You two stay over there, and keep watch from the windows!
It's probably a meteor, isn't it?
I hope that's what it is.
Dad, don't go out there!
- You stay here, lad.
- Please, dad, don't go out!
Hang on now!  Is the telephone still on!  Call the police.
Will you all please return to your homes.
You're only hampering operations by crowding the streets.
Please return to your homes.
Please get back out of the road, on to the pavement please.
Come along now, please.
Please return to your homes.
Get back.
People in here.
Right back please.
Right back.
Keep clear!
Alright.
You'll be alright.
They'll take care of you.
Okay George, let's have a look at you.
Oh, don't you start fussing too.
I've got singed, that's all.
It's still too hot to put water on.
It could do with another pump.
It should be heavily green now.
What's all this about, chief?
It could be practically anything.
The object was first sighted at about 9:15 this evening.
And its approach was widely observed over the southern counties.
A statement just issued by the home office, stresses that there is no general danger.
Members of the public however are warned to stay away from the area.
I will repeat that.
The Home Office stresses that there is no immediate danger.
Do you realize what you'll have to face if this turns out to be a disaster, Quatermass.
- How much further?
- 150 miles, sir.
Quatermass, I'm talking to you!
For the last 20 miles I've been painfully aware of that.
Well that answered that.  How did it happen?  What went wrong?
For the first time in the history of the world, man has sent a rocket
1500 miles into space.
You can't expect such an experiment to be perfect.
Well, you must have had some ideas.
I'm a scientist, not a fortune-teller who predicts what will happen.
- Well you had instrument, radio contact.
- We lost it for over 57 hours. sir.
Poor old Glooseman don't even know how far it's been.
It had no further contact even when it return to the orbit.
Yet you brought it down by your own control.
Well, that's something to tell your ministry.
Create a mess, set it up and he brought it back.
Please!  Oh, please.
Couldn't you pick some other time for this.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Carroon.
I happened to be concerned with the Ministry of Defense.
And I'm not a civil servant, I'm a doctor.
And I happened to be concerned with 3 men.  The 3 men who are in that rocket.
Oakley, Green, this is it?
Certainly no secret.
Sorry, no one's allowed past this point.
Ministry of Defense.
Oh, yes, sir.
Alright there, open up.
Sorry Miss, you will have to keep back.
Hoi, Miss!
Hey, you have to get back, please!
Miss!
Hi Ike, chasing the girls again.
Aye, you'd think it bank holiday the way they come flocking out.
I'd like to flock home.
You stay put, my lad, until that thing cools off.
Or blows up.
Now don't start that story going around.  I said it's not a bomb.
- So why can't we put water on it?
- Listen, Charlie. We've had instructions.
Don't ask me why because I didn't tell us.
Hey, hey.  Just a minute!
- Mr Blake, Ministry of Defense!
- I'll get the inspector.
- Try and get through to them Marsh.
- Right, sir.
Get the temperature reading.
Why don't you go and wait in the car, Judith?
It's funny.
It looks exactly the same.
Yet it's been, who knows how far.
There isn't a word.
Hello Q-1, hello.
Q-1, Q-1, This is Marsh.
Hello Carroon, Green, Reichenheim.
You receive me?  Over.
Keep trying.
- Mr. Blake?
- I'm Quatermass.
I'll be in charge from here on inspector.
Can't say I'm sorry about that.  What's the next move?
We can't do anything right now.
Not until that cools off.
- How long left is that?
- I would say 3 or 4 hours at least.
Q-1, Q-1, this is Marsh.
Can you hear me?  Over.
You keeping them there for four hours?
I suppose you'd like me to open it up right now, huh?
One blast of air in against that heat will incinerate them.
Sir, reporters have arrived.
They'd like some facts.
- They'll get some later.
- They'll get some now. Bring them on Major.
Don't you think we ought to find out a few more ourselves first?
Bring them on, Major.
Are you hearing me Q-1?
Are you hearing me?
This is Marsh calling Q-1.
Q-1, over.
You know, if I ever gave them all the facts, you'd find one or two of them difficult to explain.
Don't try and drag me through the mud, Blake, you might splash a little bit on yourself, you and your committee.
You deliberately launched that rocket without waiting for official sanction.
If the whole world waited for official sanction, it would be standing still.
You took too long.
- I made my own decision.
- To gamble with 3 men's lives!
Every experiment is a gamble.
The unknown is always a risk.
- They should know that.
- Did she know that?
That woman over there waiting, hoping and praying?
It dropped another 100 degrees since we arrived.
We still got a long way to go.
Let's hope that insulation lining doesn't crack up.
Yes, let's hope it didn't.
Because if it did, Quatermass and those 3 men in there are dead...
Dead or alive they'll be heroes.
Let me tell you something, Blake.
They'll fire the imagination so that there'll be a 100 men begging for the same privilege when we launch the second rocket.
- You can't stop it now.
- You mean I can't stop you now.
That's right.
This is Marsh calling Q-1.
Do you hear me?  Over.
There's nothing, sir.
Nothing Quatermass.
You know what you've done.
I launched it and I brought it back, that's quite an achievement, I think.
- And those 3 men ...
- Quiet!
- What is it, Marsh?
- Something came through.
Pull up. Brian pull up.
The tapping coming from inside.
By the hull, near the transmitter.
Q-1, Q-1.
Green, Reichenheim,
Carroon.  This is Quatermass.
We can hear you, can you hear us?
Over.
Q-1, Q-1, can you hear me?
You've landed in England.
We are here not 50 yards from you.
Are you all right?   Over.
Tapping has stopped.
We can't wait.  We've got to get them out of there now.
- Bring me the fire chief.
- Right away. sir.
- Set the remote control.
- Are you mad?
Do you know what will happen if we have no rocket door now?
We've got to take that risk.  We know one of them is alive in there.
In an hour, he may not be.
But you said that would incinerate them.  You can't do a thing like that!
Don't tell me what I can do, what I can't do.
That shell temperature is still 300 degrees.
Alright.  What would you suggest?
Wait till it's absolutely safe and then bring him out dead?
- Door control set, sir.
- Hold it.
Where's that fire chief?
Get an ambulance move in.
You want me, sir?
Yes.  Round up every man and piece of machinery you've got.
Move it in there as close as possible.
We're gonna open the rocket door from here by remote control.
When the door opens, when I give you the signal.
I want every hose turned full force around that entrance.
Now you got it?
Oh, that thing's still as hot as the base, I don't know.
If you start pumping water ...
Don't argue with me.
I know what I'm doing.
I hope so, sir.
- Major.
- Sir.
I want this whole field cleared.
When they come out of the rocket,
I want absolutely no one on the field.
Do you understand?
No one.
Don't worry, sir.
There's someone alive in there.
We don't know what condition they'll be.
So you better get everything out.
Oxygen, morphine, glucose ...
Well, now it's up to you.
Keep your eye on me.
I'll give you the signal.
- All set?
- Set, sir.
Start it up.
Let me know when you're minus 10 the pressure.
Right, sir.
Minus ten
Nine
Eight
Seven
Six
Five
Four
Three
Two
One
Zero.
Turn off the water.
- It's Mr Carroon.
- Victor!
- Victor, darling!
- Get them into the ambulance!
- What about the others?
- Darling.
Green! Reichenheim!
What happened son?
The access chamber, there's more inside.
Quick, the manual control.
Where are the others?
This thing works?
It's free, sir.
- They are not there.
- Not there.  What do you mean not there?
I mean they're not in the rocket, either one of them.
- Oh, that's impossible. They must be!
- He's right, sir.  They're gone.
- The pressure suits?
- Empty.
Still linked.  Helmets are still attached but they're empty.
How the hell could they possibly have gone out?
If I knew that I wouldn't be wasting my time trying to find out.
Go bring the camera down.
Do you think the door opened and they were swept away?
If the door had opened it'd be registered here.
No, that door has not been opened, till now.
What are you just trying to tell me?
I'm not trying to tell you anything.
Let the camera do that.
I'm afraid the camera can't tell us anything.
Are they all right?
Something happened.
They're not there.
Victor!
Where is Green?
Where's Reichenheim?
- What happened?
- Please, not now.
Quatermass!
He is in no condition to talk.
He's in truth still in a state of shock!
He must be treated.
He's got to talk first.  He's got to tell me what happened!
Gordon!
What is it Victor?
What is it?
He said "help me".
That's all he said.
"Help me".
SPACE ROCKET :
SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENT SUCCESSFUL
ROCKET LANDS AT NIGHT IN THE COUNTRYSIDE
WHY THE SECRECY?
QUATERMASS:
NO TO A POLICE INVESTIGATION
METROPOLITAN POLICE
FORENSIC LABORATORY
- You get it?
- Yes, sir.
Good.
Alright, so he's just making any ... but he got a lump state with the wife.
Any special reason?
Uh huh, my favourite day of the month.
Payday.
Oh, I'm a big man on payday.
Yes, sir.
- See the papers?
- Quatermass?
Still to get up for the police.
How dare he take fingerprints from a sick man?
There's nothing else they could do?
He couldn't talk, couldn't answer any questions.
Thought it would be might as well get his prints.
You never know.
No, you never know.
He's a weird one, alright.
Skin it ... just like shaking hands with a piece of ice.
Sergeant, that's no way to talk about a public hero.
Come in.
A Mr Quatermass to see you, sir.
Well, speaking of public heroes.
- Alright, bring him in..
- Yes, sir.
Quatermass, heh?
This is what's known as penetrating into enemy territory.
- Inspector Lomax.
- I'm Lomax.
This is Sergeant Best.
Won't you sit down?
I'll come direct to the point, Inspector.
I will not have your men coming into my research center and treating Victor Carroon as though he were a pathological criminal.
- No, he ...
- He's a sick man, Inspector.
He's been through an ordeal that very few man could survive.
Two men didn't survive it, did they Mr Quatermass?
What exactly do you mean by that?
I wish you'd sit down.
If I sit and you stand, I'm being rude.  I'm longing to sit down.
You see, Mr Quatermass,
I'm an old-fashion sort of chap.
I don't know much about rockets or travelling in space.
I don't read science fiction,
I'm a plain simple bible man.
I have a routine mind, and
I have to do routine things.
Such as fingerprinting an unconscious man.
When 3 men take off in a rocket and only one comes back in our reckoning that leaves minus 2.
And minus 2 puts us in an embarrassing position having to investigate plus 1.
Now whether he is conscious, unconscious or a gibbering idiot.
Fine.  I guess that can save you a lot of time, Inspector with your so called investigation.
I have here, the particulars on all 3 members of the crew.
Charles Green, Ludwig
Reichenheim, Victor Carroon.
You'll find everything there, Inspector.
Medical histories, personal descriptions, academic achievements, professional activities, politics and even fingerprints.
Well, that is very thoughtful of you.
There is only one investigation likely to serve any good purpose in this situation, Inspector.
That's the scientific one.
I'm sure even you will agree, that between us,
I am the best qualified for that assignment.
Good day, Inspector, Sergeant.
Well, we might all well say we've been given a ride.
Yes, sir.
It's absolutely unbelievable.
It just isn't clinically possible that his heart should just pump like this.
Pulse, blood pressure the same.
Impossibly low.
He shouldn't be alive but he is.
Can't you do something to increase the metabolic rate?
Tried everything.
No effect.
I never knew pressure effects to last this long.
Well, these aren't just pressure effects.
Take a look at his face, take a look at the skin.
Anyway, here on the shoulder.
Feel it.
Swollen, coarsened.
Yes, and that's not all either.
Look at the contour of the face.
You mean the bone structure?
Yes, it could be rather limp, but not about the shape of the bones.
There's been a change,
I'm convinced of that.
Is he any better?
He's coming along fine.
If only he'd say something.
Give us a sign that he's thinking, that he knows we're here.
He knows, Judith.
He knows we're trying to help him.
What is happening to him?
Well, that's what we're trying to find out.
Shouldn't he be in a hospital?
- That's exactly where he should be.
- Briscoe!
I can't take this responsibility any longer.
I haven't got the proper equipment here to do the right tests.
He belongs in a hospital.
Well, I suppose you're right.
I suppose you're both right.
He does belong in a hospital.
But can a hospital do more than you can do?
Would a hospital know what goes on out there in space?
On the other side of the earth, it's a whole new would out there.
A wilderness, uncharted.
And he's been there and come back.
He's got the map.
Unlock his mind for me, Briscoe, and find it.  I know you can do it.
It isn't just the ...
I know the strain and tension you've been under.
But to stop now, when we're so close.
On the brink of something tremendous.
The very fringe of some great discovery.
We can't stop now, Briscoe.
Besides, it's our only chance to learn what happened to the others.
At the hospital you have almost  ...
Does the hospital know how to deal with a man who's been exposed to rocket radiation?
- It is that she knows that ...
- Or the effects of pressure at 1500 miles up?
During flight training it took 7 times the force of gravity without even a headache.
We know that.
But would a hospital know it?
Well, I'll try another transfusion, see if that will help.
Thanks.
You'll stay with him, won't you Judith?
He needs you.
Victor.
I am going to move him into the office.
We can make him more comfortable in there.
- Would you help me, please?
- Of course.
Thank you for all you're doing, Gordon.
Aye, I only wish I could do more.
The solution is elementary, my dear Inspector.
Victor Carroon killed the two men, removed their pressure suits, pushed their bodies out into space and then linked the suits together again.
- Now, what do you want?
- Two things.
Number 1, I want to return these files.
Green, Reichenheim, Carroon.
- Very interesting. Carroon ...
- Number 2?
Well, I want you to give me your solemn word...
Well Inspector, I'm a very busy man.
Now look sir, nobody ever wins a cold war.
One of us must come over to the other side.
You don't want to come over to mine.
I'm not proud, I'll come over to yours.
Solemn word about what?
That these were Carroon's fingerprints.
Of course they were.
Everybody in ... gets fingerprinted.
What are you getting at?
Ahh, to be quite honest,
I don't quite know, sir.
Nothing unusual about these.
These are the fingerprints we took off Carroon last night.
What about them?
Compare them.
- Is this a joke?
- This is no joke, sir.
The man who took those had his training in the fingerprint section, second nature to him.
But these prints aren't even ... human.
Yes. Yeah.
You found what?
I'll be right there.
Well, wherever you're going, I might as well keep you company, mightn't I?
Thank you.
Very nice of you.
Mr Lionel has checked the specification of the wiring.
Right there.
Can you get at it?
No.
It's right in a crevice.
Hand me the samples spoon in that box.
Any more of it?
Yes sir, lots.
On the left, by the rivet there.
Mind if we have a sample for our people?
Sure, we'll give you a sample.
Briscoe, what do you think it is?
I do not know a thing, I'm not sure.
I've been in this thing all night.
I smell there's such thing around the whole town.
Can I have that lamp?
You got the same bright thoughts that I have?
Something happened in here.
Something beyond our understanding at the moment.
If I only knew where to begin.
- Maybe the film will help?
- Film?
Guess the lab should have developed it by now.
I thought you told me the camera was smashed.
It was rather damaged but
I managed to get the film out.
Why didn't you tell me?
The lab said they didn't know if they could develop it or not.
They've got to develop it.
You get right down to that laboratory and tell them they've got to develop that film!
- Yes, sir.
- And I'll have no delays or excuses!
Tell them to get the best process man in the company!
Tell them to get anybody they want, but I've got to have that film.
Right, sir.
This is one frankly
I don't want to miss.
Well?
It's harmless, it's organic, it's jelly.
End of analysis.
No definite identification?
It might conceivably represent the dead remnants of cell tissue.
- What sort of cell tissue?
- Could be animal, could be human.
- Human?
- Could have been.
- Do you know what you're saying?
- I know what I'm thinking.
Are you sure it's not some sort of plant cell?
Positive.
You mean to say that you're asking me to believe that that is the remains of two human beings?
I'm not asking you to believe anything.
You asked a question, I answered it.
Does she know?
No, it's the best sleep she's had in nights.
What about the police analyst?
What do they say?
No report through yet.
But I don't doubt it will be the same.
It's almost beyond human understanding.
Some fantastic invisible force ... converted two men into ... jelly.
- Is that the slide?
- That's the slide.
I'm about to call it a day, Quatermass.
- Beyond this I'm a ...
- Gordon!
Alright, get him up.
No, wait a minute.
His hand, another change.
Get him back to bed.
Look what's happening to his skin in just the last few moments.
I'll go and get him a sedative.
You've done it to him.
He'd been better off if he'd been killed and stayed out there.
Judith!
You've destroyed him like you destroyed everything else you've touched.
Destroyed him?
I've brought him back, I've saved him!
Saved him for what?
For further experiments?
I can help him more than you or anyone else can.
There's no room for personal feelings in science, Judith.
Some of us have a mission.
You should be very proud to have a husband who's willing to risk his life for the betterment of the whole world.
What world?  Your world?
The world of Quatermass!
I have sent for an ambulance.
He's going to the Central Clinic.
Alright Briscoe.
Send them to the clinic.
But I want them to have complete isolation, you understand.
Complete isolation.
No one is to see them.
No one, until I say so.
We've tried three different grade of stock, developed each one to its higher gamma as possible and still it's made no difference.
- Look at this.  It's grainy and dark.
- All I want is a print!
Well, we don't like any print that isn't up to standard.
Is there a picture of it?
Oh, there's a picture alright.
But you can see how dull and grainy ...
I don't care how dull and grainy it is.   I must have this now.
It could be altitude, or an extreme change of temperature, or penetration of cosmic rays.
Fine, fine.
I'll tell him that.
Well, I don't know what the old man will say.
Listen, you tell your old man that our old man says if he didn't get this print he'd dynamite the building.
I can't tell the Ministry this.
They'll think I lost my senses.
That's exactly why you must tell them nothing.
Now you see why I must have absolute authority to isolate Carroon.
But every newspaper in town has got a story on him being admitted into the clinic.
They'll want to know why and what's happened to him on what's happened to the others.
- Alright, do you want to tell him?
- But not telling them won't stop the panic.
What they don't know won't start a panic.
- Inspector, what about the police analysis?
- The same, Mr Blake.
Well, what's the next move?
Oh, we've agreed to isolation.  There isn't anything we can do until we know more.
Yeah?
The film is ready.
- See that Marsh, it works!
- Yes, sir.
- What works?
- Automatic prism.
It touch on the panel reading.
What?  Is that all?
Once in the observation zone, the camera's geared to cut out at regular intervals.
This will be at 0.160.
That must be where we lost them.
What the hell could have happened?
Look at that fantastic temperature drop.
Run it again.
He's in surgery.
But I'll get word to him as soon as possible.
Yes, what's the name, please?
That's two T's?
Yes, I'll see that he gets it.
Yes.
Sorry, miss, the visiting hours are over.
I just wanted to know how my husband is.
I'll try and find out for you, miss.
- What would the name be?
- Carroon, Victor Carroon.
- Oh.
- He's alright, isn't he?
Mrs Carroon, I wish I could let you go up, but we have strict
- orders about your husband.
- All I want to know is how is he?
Is there any change?
Just a minute.
Hello Mabel?
Listen, how is 4B?
I know about the orders, but
I only want you to think out loud.
Thank you, Mabel.
Thank you.
Still about the same, Mrs Carroon, no change but no worse.
If I could see him, just for a few minutes.
I should be shot at dawn.
- But don't you worry. He's in good hands.
- They don't leave him alone, do they?
Ooh, not for a moment.
Tucker, his night nurse is with him now and Perkins comes on in about half an hour.
- The fella is good as any doctor.
- Could I wait for the night nurse when he comes off duty.
If only to talk to someone who has been with him.   Please.
Tucker comes off in about half an hour.
He usually dips out through the staff entrance.
Turn left through the doors and it's on the right.
- Thank you.
- Wait for him outside.
And if the ask me,
I never told you nothing.
There's only the nurse with him.  His name's Tucker.
His name?  You mean
I got to plan for the "he"?
Please hurry.  You've only got half and hour before the relief nurse comes on duty.
- Another one in pants?
- His name's Perkins.
Have you got any money?
Cash before delivery, it always gives me more confidence.
Especially when I'm investigating is this type ...
- Room 4B.
- 4B.
Give me 15 minutes.
I'll put him in the lift and standing by.  Then he's all yours.
- I never saw you in my ...
- Please hurry.  He's very sick.
Don't worry I'll murder him like a baby.
You've got to get it.
Relax lady, you're shaking the building.
- Good evening.
- Yes.
Evening.  I'm from casualty.
Perkins is sick.
They sent me to take over his night shift.
Fine, I don't know in two hours, but you're not until for another half hour!
Who cares?  Night shift is night shift.
What's a half an hour you got there.
You know you go to heaven for this.
With our rate of pay, we should get some fun out of life.
- What's his trouble?
- Doesn't seem to know.
He's the star patient.
He just lies and stares.
Never opens his mouth.  But if he does, press that bell and quick.
Well, happy nightmare.
- Any special instructions?
- It's all on the chart.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
News my friend.
Your wife is waiting for you downstairs.
I'm the man who's gonna get you out of here.
Does that make you happy?
It does.
Good!
Now we don't have too much time, so up we get.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- What time are you off?
- Ask him whether he's going to live or not.
- Operating?
- About three and a half hours at least.
- You too?
- Me too.
Chinese restaurants open until midnight.
Take your vote.
Beautiful sweet and sour pork,
- roast duck, fried shrimps.
- You talked us into it.
Here we are, now the jacket.
That's a good boy.
Can't meet the lady looking sloppy.
You know it's funny, wives usually employ me to get them away from their husbands.
Oh, you're a sad one!
Well, to each his own.
Hey, steady, steady.
Now you stay here while Christie goes and get the lift.  Won't be a minute.
All clear.
Hey, come on, hurry.
That's the boy.  Christie's got you.
What have you got there?
What are you hiding?
What is it?
Victor.
Oh Victor, darling.
I've got the car outside.
Please try and be quick.
You can make it dear.
Everything's going to be alright, Victor.
I'll get you the best treatment, the finest doctors.
I'll get you well and strong.
We'll make a new life for ourselves.
Away from all this.
Away from him.
Our life will be our own.
Would you like one?
Victor, I ...
Victor.
Your hand.
Are you in pain?
Well, this is one case I don't think we'll find listed in forensic medicine.
It looks as though the life was drawn right out of him.
Have the body examined by a head pathologist.
I'd like a report as soon as possible.
The headlines ... pathologist also took a little beep.
I don't care if he dumps his head into a ring.
They picked up Mrs Carroon the other side of town. Car full of luggage.
- And Carroon?
- No sign of him.
Stupid idiot.  Trying to take the whole thing in her own hands.
- What did he go?  What did she say?
- She didn't say anything.
Anything about him.  She's in a pretty bad state of shock.
If not about him, then about what?
The doctor said she may even go out of her mind.
Out of her mind about what?  What did she say?  Come on, talk man.
Well, when they found her, she was just sitting at the wheel of a car.
And moaning, something about a hand being all grey with thorns like a ... like a cactus.
I remember there was a cactus in this room, in this pot.
- Can I get a line to this?
- Yes
Hello?
Hello.
Henry's coming down.
 Car-three-nine
Proceed immediately to 34 Main Elm Street ...
 and investigate a complaint by resident
maybe Carroon.
Proceed with caution car-three-nine.
Cars ....
join river police at Hayes Wharf
to search area bounded by .... and Tilly street.
River Patrol 4.
join mobile police...
to search area boarded by Toddy
Street, Hayes Lane and Strat Temps
 River Patrol 4.
Roger.  Out.
This growth on the face.
Half plant, half ...
Look at this.
Look what it's done.  The whole tissue structure's eaten away.
The bones, powder.
Well, that takes care of my supper tonight.
Briscoe, what if there is a form of life in space?
Not on some planet, but just drifting.
I don't know.
Not life, as we know it.
With intelligence, yes, but pure energy, with no organic structure.
- Invisible.
- Invisible?
Now the rocket past through its path.
It entered the rocket.  It found living specimens of our form of life.
- Cell organisms.  Human.
- Green and Reichenheim.
And Carroon.
Exactly.
Now, if even by accident it could enter one of those structures.
What a way to invade the Earth.
Now look sir, I'm not over intelligent, but when you ...
You saw the film, you know what happened.
Only God knows where and how far that rocket traveled.
- But only two of them died.
- Something got into that rocket!
Took the blood out of the other two and now it's using Carroon.
And it's found other forms of life, the cactus.
- Good grief.  You mean Carroon's ...
- a carrier.
He is now another shell of a man being transformed.
If all these cactus plants were subject to the same mutation there could be an affinity, a union between plant and animal with the ability to destroy, and possess and multiply... at will.
Multiply?
Yes, but to multiply, first it has to live.
And like any living thing, to live, it must have food.
I'm sorry, we're closed.
Alright, just a minute.
We only open until ...
Hey, wait a minute!
You can't come into a place like this!
Leave those things alone!
What do you think you're doing?
Are you in pain?
Is it something to do with your arm?
Look, I'll just take a look.
I won't hurt it, I promise.
No!
Alright love, I'll get it.
Hello?
Yes, Best.
What?
When?
Right.  Cordon off the whole area.
Tell Quatermass and
Briscoe to meet us there.
Love!
- Now what?
- I've got to go back.
- But you just come in.
- They just can't do without me, love.
I don't know why you don't move into the office.
You'd never believe I was there.
What makes you think I do now?
- Have your tea at least.
- Haven't got time, love.
The thing that you do to that poor stomach of yours.
I ought to get you a picnic basket.
What I'm going on is no picnic.
- What about dinner?
- Cook and keep your fingers crossed.
Bye love.
- What do you think he was trying to do?
- I'd like to think, kill himself.
You see if mix the normal of that, it will be death in 5 minutes.
What?  What is it?
I have a bit of sick feeling it was something to speed up the change going on inside him.
But Carroon was an engineer, he doesn't know anything about chemistry.
Carroon didn't know.
There is a kettle still on and there's no sign of the chemist anywhere.
What do you think he was doing here?
- Well, one thing he was doing ...
- We're not certain.
Not certain about anything with this customer.
Well?
Nobody in the street heard anything.
They're all in church or in the local.
He must have ...
Evans, come in quick, and quiet.
Here we are.
And it's just the two of us today.
We'll have our own tea-party.
I don't like those other girls anyway.
All they do is talk about their new clothes and dolls.
You don't care about those things, do you?
You don't care about new clothes or anything.
We're friends.
Now you sit down and be a good girl while I make the tea.
There's a teapot, there's a cup.
And I brought the most delicious cakes and biscuits.
The others never serve anything, but we do.
Look, I'm pretty yummy.
Don't be frightened, that's only the old rats living in this old boat.
Now, tea is ready.
Sugar?  One?
Two, alright.
Now you may have a cake.
This one is filled with cherries.
But anyway, I like that one cause it's full of chocolate.
Ooh, we thought you were a rat.
Won't you stay and have tea with us?
We'd very much like you to stay.
You look so tired.
There's plenty, if that's what you're worried about.
And cakes too.
Go on dolly, you ask him.
Please, won't you have tea and cakes with us?
Don't be frightened, we would like you to stay very much.
And you may have the cake that has all the chocolate inside.
Tell him, dolly.
Yes.
What time was this?
Was it an eye-witness?
I see.
Well, he's been doing fine.
He's been positively seen in Liverpool,
Margate, Ostend and the Orkneys.
Yes.
- Yes.  Deptford area.
- What?
A kid told her mother ...
Yes?
About two hours ago?
Hold it please.
The kid got a doll broken by a man down by some derelict boat near Deptford.
Oh, so it had to be Carroon?
No, the mother's complaining about molesting kids.
Deptford said the description could fit Carroon.
All right.  Well, that's why there's a police station at Deptford.
Thank you Deptford.
Keep us informed.
Bye bye.
A Deptford alert on Carroon.
Yes, I know it is, so your boys can have another little drive.
Cover derelict boats, warehouses and bomb shelters.
Alright, so do it again.
Where is he getting food, that's what I'd like to know?
Now, now shut up, Simba!
Time to go to bed.
Go on.  Off you go. Go on.
Don't stand there gaping at me.
Off you go to bed!
Goodnight fellas.
Sleep well.
Hello, Joey.
You know something?
Could have sworn I saw you having tea in a cafe this afternoon.
Turns out to be a customer though.
TO LION HOUSE
This is exactly as the keeper found him when he came on duty.
- Are the others the same?
- Yes, over here.
They found three more still outside the antelope house, or what was left of them.
Look.
Look at that.
- Complete absorption this time.
- That's what I've been afraid of.
Inspector, get this place closed, get everybody out of here.
- Right.
- Quickly and quietly as possible.
No panic, no charging.
Close the whole place up?
As we already ...
Listen, sir, you've got to take it from us.  We know what we are doing.
Just tell your men to cooperate, please.
Well, I don't understand what's happening, anyway.
What killed these animals?
- You better say natural causes for now.
- What?
Sorry, ma'am we're closed this morning.
Closed, but we've come all the way from Epping.
Sorry ma'am.  We're not to open to the public this morning.
- Will it be opened this afternoon?
- Oh, I wish I could tell you, sir.
Sorry folks, still closed.
I'm very sorry now, but we're closed this morning.
I'm very sorry, sir.
Quatermass!
Inspector!
What is it?
He was here .
Look at this.
It's alive.
- Looks pretty horrible doesn't it?
- Quick, the sample box!
Well, what manner or a shape of thing do we look for now?
You'll know it when you see it.
Just send your men out with a prayer that we find it in time.
It's almost too terrifying to think about it.
In less than 12 minutes every animal completely absorbed pray except one.
Gone like quicksand.
But this quicksand knows what it's doing.
It's trebled it's size in an hour.
Do you know what this means?
This is only a fragment of the main organism.
If the same thing is happening to him at the same rate or speed, if absorbing those mice could do this ...
I know.
There is no living thing on earth that stands a chance against it.
How do we fight it, how do we stop it?
Hands off, you young man!
Fix him and then I come here on my own accord.
Yes, yes.
I come here to complain about something which I saw.
Okay Rosie, you keep saying now ...
I refuse to talk about it to any common constable ... who has nothing comes to do all day but show me big flat fleet.
Only big fat fleet.
Now, come on, Rosie old girl.
Don't you ... call me!
I mean I'm enough to be your mother.
What respectable woman in
London would be ... now?
I come in here of my own free will.
I come come here on my own volich ... volition.
Very glad we all to see you, Rosie.
- What can we do for you this time?
- I wish to make a report.
Miss Rosemary...
Elizabeth Wrigley.
- What address this week?
- I'm temporarily visiting.
- Bow Street?
- With friends.
Salvation Army.
The embankment.
What did you see this time, Rosie?
Oh, it was terrible.
Shocking.
It always is, Rosie.
Just tell me what you saw?
Of course it's been of a thing of a young woman can't walk the streets in London with that creepy crawly thing up in around that place.
What is the police for, if not for protect us from the likes of that?
Go on.  Tell me.  Tell me what's the police force for?
- Rosie!
- Yes?
Rosie, just tell me what you saw, and we at the London Metropolitan
Police will do all in our power to see that it doesn't occur again.
You were with voice wreck so drunk, that I couldn't even yell for a copper.
I still got this sore of this.
Why is it aren't to remember.
And water makes me as sick as a baby.
It better be worthwhile, Rosie.
After you tell me.
I was sitting in a door right here.
I wasn't feeling too well.
And the doctor says that too much walking is bad for my legs.
- It's my legs you see.
- You were sitting in the door way.
Yeah, just for a minute or two.
When suddenly I heard a ... kind of rustling it was.
Rustling?
So I looked.
And there, at the end of the street, I saw something moved.
Something enormous!
What moved Rosie?
Well, I couldn't make out the shape properly.
I usually might get the shapes of these things.
Think carefully, Rosie.
Was it ...?
This something, was it walking quickly or slowly?
Walking?
It was kind of crawling, up on the wall.
Not like any of the things that
I'll see on a Saturday nights.
No Rosie, I think this time you really saw it.
Get me the Yard.
Well cancel it.  This is priority.
Really saw it?  You mean this time it's not hallu... ?
- It's not a gin goblin?
- No, Rosie.  This time it was real.
Real?
It's my legs!
Hello, Scotland Yard.
Yes. Inspector Lomax, please.
Lomax here.
Yes.
Say that again.
Contact the Commissioner right away.
Hello?
Yes.
Yes.
We'll be right there.
Lomax.
Said it climbed a brick wall 30 feet high.
Yes, no doubt at all he was here.
Quite recently too.
The trail ends on the wall.
Let me have that case up here!
Get him his case, Sergeant.
Send the car in please.
Use the car radio.
I want to cordon off the entire area and evacuate all public.
Tell Evan and Mason to check on every movement that is likely to take place inside this radius tonight.
Yes sir.
Warn everyone not to touch anything unusual they may find in the streets or their gardens.
Warn the children, especially.
It got out?
Look at the size of it now!
Without food except mice.
Is it dead?
Yes, but don't touch it.
Look at these phalanges, spore producing patches.
If the limbs complete this reproductive cycle, this would have been a jungle of living tendrils.
How many more of these things are there around London?
I think you better call Lomax.
It's not a question of how many but where are they?
If they can reproduce at this rate, another 24 hours, a few days...
Get me Scotland Yard quickly.
What's project ...
Project had reached the mice.
Yes
Yes, of course.
The Commissioner.
- They're getting him, sir.
- Right.
Get hold of Evans.
I want him to get out an anti-panic statement.
I want it broadcast, televised and fill in all the nationals.
Yes, sir.
I want every available man on search of the area.
Immediate search of parks, fields, undergrounds and subways.
Yes sir, it's the
Quatermass Experiment.
I am please enough to take advance top level sir.
I need troops and the civil defense.
Yes sir, I'll be right out.
Now this is all we need to start the program with a swing.
What's he talking about?
Oh, no one must touch anything unusual we find on the streets.
Don't panic.  Just inform the nearest police station.
They've been putting that out all day on the radio.
Westminster Abbey.
Yes
Standing by.
Opening announcement coming up.
Okay, standby cameras.
Alright Camera 1, titles are in.
We will be on you in five seconds. four, three, two, one.
Oh, you Camera 1, where are you?
Alright quick, take over Camera 2.
On you instead.
What is that?
- What's happened?
- Looks like a body.
Kill transmission.
Landrow, fill in will you?
I'll get back as soon as possible.
Tell presentations.
Hello?
What's going on here?
- He fell from the scaffold.
- Slipped?
- Dead before he fell.
- Dead before he fell?
Sir, I should believe you have a strong stomach.
- He is ... practically a skull.
- I think we better get the police.
Yes, get the police.
Well, do we go on with the program?
- It's up to you sir.
- I'm alright.
I think we better carry on in another part of the abbey.
Pull that dolly over here, will you?
Get a blanket or something to cover him up.
Come on.  Quickly.
- Mr Quatermass.
- Right.
Alright, I want the whole abbey cleared.
Public, clergy, everyone and quick.
Please, not so loud.
There's a transmission going on.
Well, the transmission's coming off.
I want you all out of this place.
Every second may count.
... spend time for the cameras only.
This is highly out of range.
Well, son, it's is an emergency.
Get this stopped.
Stop?  I can't stop it!
- Where's your producers?
- They're in the truck.
These murals were hidden under layers of painting and aged by the dust of time.
Where the other reinforcements!
Steve on Camera 2 standby on stained glass window.
Camera 3 on scaffolding hold it.
I'm Inspector Lomax.  You got to get your people out of the abbey!
Please.
Coming on to you Camera 3.
Everyone in that building maybe in deadly danger!
We're on transmission!
Back on to you Camera 1.
Pan up as high as you can and ...
What's in the name of it?
It must be 20 feet across.
Kill transmission.
Camera 1, hold that shot and log off and everybody out!
Hello, hello, listen.
Jessica, you'll just have to carry on as best you can, we can't go on here.
Yes, just fill in will you?
Quatermass, quick, in the front.
It's now in the abbey.
We have to strike it now, uh?
At the abbey.
There is an emergency.
You saw it?
We don't know what it is.
Same pattern as the one in the lab.
And it was 20 times the power of reproduction.
Its nodules if it get to spore this time, nothing will stop them.
It'll break up, they'll spread by the million wherever there's having wind.
How long before it starts reproducing?
It's on the last cycle,
80 or 90 minutes.
And within the hours, everyone will be a million.
He's coming lower!
- We've got to stop him!
- You need a miracle to stop it now.
- We've got flame throwers.
- Well, it managed to escape, the whole of it is to kill.
- Dynamite.
- That would only spread it further.
Stopped moving!
It's barely pulsating now.
That time it was out, it's its last dormant stage just before it reproduces.
It's changing again.
The beginning of new spore producing hands, dusting.
Well, it's hanging there, grabbed on the scaffolding.
Briscoe, I think we can stop it.
What now, Professor?
That scaffold inside,
I want to run cables to it.
Then tap the main power line.
I want to send enough current into that steel to burn it up.
We've got to keep pouring current into it.
We have to melt it right down to the ground.
It's our only chance.  I want every set of current in London diverted to here.
This will bring the city to a standstill.
If that thing spores before we kill it, you won't have any city!
I just hope you're right, that's alright.  Just hope you're right!
Attention everybody.
There is no cause for alarm.
I repeat.
There is no cause for alarm.
Please do not crowd.
Unless you have official business in this vicinity,
Please listeners, go back to your homes.
There is nothing to see, go back to your homes.
Hello Battlesea.  Standby.
Switch on.
Well, this time you won.
In my simple bible way,
I did a lot of praying.
One world at a time is good enough for me.
Can we ease it all up now, sir?
Is it all right, sir?
Quatermass, why wasn't
I informed about all this?
I only just heard, sir.
Could have been here sooner.
Is there anything I can do?
- Yes, Marsh.  Gonna need some help.
- Help, sir?  What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna start again.

{11028}{11082}...but I trust you've found|everything you needed.
{11084}{11146}Thank you, sir. It was most thoughtful.
{11148}{11202}It was the least I could do|after such a journey.
{11204}{11243}Yes, it is a long journey.
{11245}{11313}And tiring, no doubt.|Permit me to show you to your room.

{11987}{12075}DRACULA: When you wish. There are|a large number of volumes to be indexed.
{12554}{12661}- Is there anything else you need?|- I don't think so. You've been very kind.
{12663}{12729}On the contrary, it is entirely my privilege.
{12731}{12827}I am very fortunate to have found such|a distinguished scholar to work for me.
{12836}{12876}I like quiet and seclusion.

{13063}{13118}There is just one more thing, Mr. Harker.
{13135}{13217}I have to go out and will not be back|until after sundown tomorrow.

{51480}{51592}When I was outside I thought I heard you|talking to someone.

{51728}{51758}No, sir.
{51784}{51804}Yes.
{52212}{52316}DICTAPHONE: The power of the crucifix|in these cases is two-fold:
{52356}{52429}It protects the normal human being...
{52442}{52524}...but reveals the vampire or victim...
{52537}{52649}...of this vile contagion|when in advanced stages.
{53128}{53160}It is established...
{53171}{53280}...that victims consciously detest|being dominated by vampirism...
{53292}{53386}...but are unable|to relinquish the practice...
{53407}{53475}...similar to addiction to drugs.
{53504}{53597}Ultimately death results|from loss of blood.
{53620}{53728}But, unlike normal death,|no peace manifests itself...
{53757}{53854}...for they enter into the fearful state|of the undead.
{53898}{53947}Since the death of Jonathan Harker...
{53965}{54000}...Count Dracula...
{54007}{54104}...the propagator of this unspeakable evil,|has disappeared.

{59188}{59288}MINA: Did Arthur tell you?|LUCY: Nobody told me. I just knew.

{59474}{59535}Jonathan has told me so many things|about you.
{59540}{59598}HELSING: Nice things, I hope.|LUCY: Very nice.
{59619}{59649}Now, let's see.
{60026}{60105}Don't you worry,|we'll soon have you well again.

{60164}{60247}I'm sorry you had a wasted journey,|about Jonathan, I mean.
{60261}{60337}It wasn't wasted, I promise you.|Good day, Miss Lucy.
{60564}{60620}How could she have known|of Jonathan's death?
{60638}{60741}- A premonition. It's not uncommon.|- But she took it so calmly, it worries me.
{60748}{60811}I'm afraid there are more urgent things|to worry about.
{60813}{60878}Those marks on her neck,|when did they first appear?
{60881}{60941}I noticed them first|shortly after she became ill.
{60943}{61011}I asked her. She told me|she thought she had been stung.
{61016}{61051}MINA: It's quite possible.
{61053}{61139}Dr. Seward said she needs fresh air.|Her windows are open all the time.
{61167}{61215}Between the hours of sunset and sunrise...
{61217}{61311}...all the windows in her room,|with the exception of a small fanlight...
{61320}{61356}...must be kept shut.

{61561}{61629}...however unorthodox they may appear.|- Yes, I know, but...
{61673}{61768}If you love Miss Lucy,|be guided by me, I beg you.
{61800}{61856}I'll do anything to make her well again.
{61914}{61987}You must get some garlic flowers,|as many as you can.
{61996}{62073}Place them by her windows, her door,|and by her bedside.
{62084}{62163}They may be taken out during the day,|but under no circumstances...
{62165}{62248}...even if the patient implores you,|must they be removed at night.
{62332}{62420}I cannot impress upon you how important|it is that you obey my instructions.
{62449}{62525}Do exactly as I say|and we may be able to save her.
{62529}{62586}If you don't, she will die.
{62647}{62687}I'll be here in the morning.

{63496}{63551}GERDA: Heavens, child! What is it?
{63600}{63651}These flowers, I can't stand them!
{63656}{63714}They do smell strong,|but Mrs. Holmwood said...
{63716}{63784}I don't care what she said!|Please, take them away!
{63841}{63903}Please, Gerda, they stifle me.
{63968}{64036}All right, miss, I'll take them out.
{64040}{64105}And the windows,|you'll open the windows?
{64108}{64166}Yes, Miss Lucy, if that's what you want.
{64639}{64682}I'll come back for the rest.
{64989}{65066}[Foreboding instrumental music]
{65437}{65488}There was nothing I could do to save her.
{66086}{66127}SEWARD: Doctor...
{66226}{66287}HELSING: Mrs. Holmwood,|did you do as I told you?
{66302}{66360}She did. And you have seen the result.
{66389}{66446}Please, sir. Excuse me, sir.
{66453}{66558}It was all my fault.|She couldn't breathe. She looked so ill.
{66560}{66630}She begged me to open the windows|and throw away the plants.
{66632}{66696}I know you told me not to, ma'am, but...
{66698}{66733}What time was this?
{66764}{66802}About midnight.
{66824}{66875}GERDA: I heard a noise...|ARTHUR: Okay, Gerda...
{66881}{66932}...you may go now.|- Yes, thank you, sir.
{66960}{67016}I am so sorry, sir.
{67101}{67196}Whatever happened, all I know is|that you have brought us nothing but grief.
{67199}{67244}First Jonathan, and now Lucy.
{67264}{67375}Whoever you are, whatever your motives,|please go and leave us in peace.
{67435}{67531}Mr. Holmwood, when I told you|about Jonathan, I thought it best...
{67533}{67623}...to spare the details of the dreadful|circumstances in which he died.
{67656}{67739}But the tragic death of your sister|is so closely linked with his...
{67757}{67812}...that I think|you should now know the truth.
{67814}{67899}I can't expect you to believe me,|but you will believe Jonathan.
{67942}{68004}Here are his last words. His diary.
{68029}{68089}When you have read it,|you will understand.
{68741}{68772}ARTHUR: What is it, Gerda?
{68774}{68835}It's a policeman, sir.|He's got Tania with him.
{68852}{68879}Tania?
{68892}{68951}- Show him in, Gerda.|- Very good, sir.
{69092}{69172}- Good evening, ma'am. Good evening, sir.|- What is it, officer?
{69179}{69268}I found this little girl.|She was very distressed indeed.
{69291}{69369}- Tell them what you told me.|- I don't want to.
{69484}{69540}MINA: There's no need to be frightened.
{69544}{69613}Come on over here, sit with me,|and tell me all about it.
{69672}{69748}You don't want Mr. Holmwood|to think you're a crybaby, do you?
{69759}{69796}You're a big girl now.
{69832}{69869}Tell me what happened.
{69907}{69993}I was out by myself,|and she came up to me.
{70008}{70093}And said, "Hello, Tania,|shall we go for a little walk?"
{70110}{70179}I said yes. And we went for a walk.
{70193}{70278}Then someone came along,|and she ran away and left me...
{70284}{70317}...and I was lost.
{70355}{70415}Who was she? Who did you see?
{70456}{70498}Come on. Tell me.
{70515}{70539}Who was she?
{70580}{70610}Aunt Lucy.
{70642}{70709}[Dramatic instrumental music]
{71926}{71993}[Foreboding instrumental music]
{72603}{72691}- I heard you call me, Aunt Lucy.|- Yes, dear.
{72797}{72827}LUCY: Come along.
{72855}{72926}You're cold. Where are we going?
{72928}{73019}For a little walk. I know somewhere|nice and quiet where we can play.
{73836}{73932}Is it much further, Aunt Lucy? I'm so tired.
{73944}{73990}We're nearly there, my darling.
{74015}{74039}Lucy!
{74167}{74222}Arthur, dear brother!
{74224}{74258}Lucy!
{74260}{74341}Dear Arthur, why didn't you come sooner?
{74395}{74451}Come, let me kiss you.
{74460}{74503}[Gasping]
{74662}{74704}[Lucy screaming]
{75328}{75375}HELSING: Put this on.
{75414}{75500}TANIA: Please, I want to go home.|HELSING: And so you shall.
{75520}{75592}I'll fetch Mr. Holmwood|and we can all go home together.
{75596}{75695}- Not Aunt Lucy.|- No, not Aunt Lucy. Now you sit here.
{75715}{75748}Be a good girl.
{75776}{75870}You look like a teddy bear now.|Will you wear this pretty thing?
{75945}{75979}Isn't that lovely?
{75987}{76047}- You promise not to run away?|- I promise.
{76122}{76201}If you watch over there,|you'll see the sun come up.
{76253}{76280}Keep warm.
{76687}{76721}You understand now?
{76786}{76848}- But why Lucy?|- Because of Jonathan.
{76872}{76949}You read in his diary|about the woman he found at Klausenberg.
{76961}{77002}This is Dracula's revenge.
{77015}{77070}- Lucy is to replace that woman.|- Oh, no!
{77084}{77175}I've watched her tomb each night|since she was interred three days ago.
{77188}{77248}Tonight she ventured out for the first time.
{77257}{77352}Holmwood, I know your one wish|is that Lucy should rest in peace.
{77354}{77432}I promise to fulfill that wish. But first...
{77448}{77530}...if I have your consent,|she can lead us to Dracula.
{77560}{77608}How can you suggest such a thing?
{77628}{77708}That she should be possessed by this evil|for another second?
{77740}{77832}What about Gerda's child,|and the others she will defile?
{77854}{77901}No, I couldn't! I couldn't!
{78077}{78123}Of course.
{78130}{78203}Will you take that child home|and meet me back here in an hour?
{78247}{78276}It's all right.
{78278}{78350}It's nearly dawn,|she won't leave the coffin again.
{78668}{78705}Is there no other way?
{78743}{78776}But it's horrible!
{78811}{78849}Please, try and understand.
{78871}{78952}This is not Lucy, the sister you loved.|It's only a shell.
{78956}{79019}Possessed and corrupted|by the evil of Dracula!
{79028}{79092}To liberate her soul|and give it eternal peace...
{79104}{79161}...we must destroy that shell for all time!
{79218}{79267}Believe me, there is no other way.
{79872}{79912}[Screaming]
{81264}{81336}[Suggestive instrumental music]
{81758}{81809}- Drink this.|- I'm all right now.
{81819}{81876}- Drink it.|- Thanks.
{82019}{82088}There's so much in Jonathan's diary|I don't understand.
{82111}{82170}Can Dracula really be as old|as it says here?
{82187}{82222}We believe it's possible.
{82224}{82292}Vampires are known|to have gone on from century to century.
{82294}{82371}Records show that Count Dracula|could be 500 or 600 years old.
{82430}{82463}Another thing.
{82465}{82536}I always understood that|if there were such things...
{82543}{82609}...they could change themselves|into bats or wolves.
{82651}{82690}That's a common fallacy.
{82747}{82808}The study of these creatures|has been my life's work.
{82810}{82882}I did research with some|of the greatest authorities in Europe.
{82884}{82944}And yet,|we've only just scratched the surface.
{82950}{83009}A great deal is known|about the vampire bat.
{83023}{83092}But details of these re-animated bodies|of the dead...
{83111}{83159}...the "undead," as we call them...
{83163}{83251}...are so obscure, that many biologists|will not believe they exist.
{83319}{83376}Of course, you are shocked and bewildered.
{83389}{83459}How can you expect|to understand in so short a time?
{83465}{83528}But you've read and experienced enough|to know...
{83533}{83606}...that this unholy cult must be wiped out.
{83626}{83724}- I hope that you will help me.|- I'll do anything you say.
{83748}{83772}Thank you.
{83793}{83845}Of course, we do know certain things.
{83867}{83917}You witnessed one a little while ago.
{83931}{83994}And we also know that during the day...
{83997}{84056}...the vampire must rest in his native soil.
{84078}{84104}Now.
{84125}{84210}When I went to Castle Dracula,|a hearse came tearing through the gates.
{84212}{84255}In that hearse was a coffin.
{84264}{84336}I believe it contained Dracula|and a bed of his own earth.
{84346}{84431}To get here, that hearse would have|to come via the frontier at Ingstadt.
{84438}{84490}They'll have a record|of where it was going.
{84492}{84580}We need that address.|Will you come with me to Ingstadt?
{84659}{84716}How long will it take?|I must let Mina know.
{84718}{84811}HELSING: With any luck,|we should be back by tomorrow morning.
{84916}{84952}Customs House
{85046}{85130}That is quite out of the question, sir.|Against regulations.
{85132}{85179}We want to know|where that coffin was going.
{85181}{85248}I can't give away information|without proper authority.
{85250}{85337}- This is very urgent! I am a doctor.|- I'm sorry, sir.
{85373}{85423}There's a lad with a message for you.
{85425}{85474}Personal, he said.|He wouldn't give it to me.
{85476}{85518}All right, Gerda, I'll see him.
{85769}{85810}- Yes?|- You're Mrs. Holmwood?
{85820}{85868}- I am.|- Got a message for you.
{85872}{85979}You're to go to 49 Frederickstrasse|right away. And you're not to tell anyone.
{85981}{86006}Who says?
{86008}{86076}Arthur Holmwood, he calls himself.|Said you'd know him.
{86096}{86162}But that's impossible.|My husband has gone to Ingstadt.
{86164}{86246}Not if he gave me this message, he hasn't.|And he gave me this message.
{86248}{86273}Good night.
{86344}{86400}You need permission|from the ministry in writing.
{86402}{86469}I have my orders and I must obey them.
{86472}{86573}It is laid down in the government|regulations that under no circumstances...
{86633}{86746}...may an unauthorized person|be permitted to examine...
{86800}{86910}Of course, in an emergency,|we do sometimes make an exception.
{86912}{86968}And seeing this gentleman is a doctor...

{88980}{89049}GERDA: Are you sure|I can't get you anything to eat, sir?
{89068}{89116}No, thank you, Gerda. We haven't time.
{89118}{89184}But I would like a word|with Mrs. Holmwood before we go.
{89188}{89266}- Will you go up and see if she's awake yet?|- Yes, sir.
{89492}{89522}Are you ready?
{89760}{89822}- She's not there, sir.|- Not there?
{89824}{89848}GERDA: No, sir.
{89862}{89891}MINA: Good morning.
{89986}{90034}ARTHUR: Mina, you gave me quite a fright.
{90044}{90097}Where have you been|at this hour of the morning?
{90099}{90184}It was such a lovely day, I got up early|and went for a walk in the garden.
{90186}{90271}- I didn't expect you back so soon.|- I'm afraid I have to go out again.
{90305}{90376}- When will you be back?|- I can't say for sure.
{90404}{90464}You look pale. Are you all right?
{90484}{90559}Arthur, darling, don't fuss.|I feel perfectly well.
{90603}{90637}Good-bye, darling.
{91425}{91544}Perhaps you'd better let me lead the way,|these steps can be dangerous.
{91556}{91652}We don't want to have an accident, do we?|No, we don't.
{91664}{91750}An old man came here once|to see his dear departed...
{91752}{91838}...and he fell down these stairs.|It was quite amusing.
{91840}{91957}He came to pay his last respects|and he remained to share them.
{91990}{92020}Quite amusing.
{92080}{92124}Where are we? Where are we?
{92172}{92218}It's around the back, somewhere.
{92220}{92295}It's been here so long|it's bound to be at the back, isn't it?
{92297}{92350}MARX: This way, gentlemen.|You follow me.
{92368}{92425}I know where it was. This way.
{92508}{92553}This is extraordinary!
{92575}{92656}It was there. I know it was,|because I saw it only yesterday.
{92666}{92750}I really don't understand|who could have moved it.
{92912}{92986}The hearse driver might've lied|to the frontier official...
{92988}{93023}...about where he was going.
{93025}{93076}But the fellow at the morgue wasn't lying.
{93078}{93137}He was surprised|when he saw the coffin wasn't there.
{93139}{93178}He must have had it sometime.
{93180}{93289}- I think he's still somewhere in Karlstadt.|- But where? This is a big town.
{93312}{93363}Not many places he could hide,|don't forget.
{93365}{93401}There is that, of course.
{93412}{93481}What are you two|being so mysterious about over there?
{93490}{93540}We'll be with you in a moment, darling.
{93604}{93698}There is an old neglected graveyard|about 3 miles from here.
{93714}{93767}Somewhere in this area.
{93787}{93826}St. Joseph's.
{93872}{93900}Just one moment.
{94012}{94078}Mina, my dear, don't think I'm being silly...
{94087}{94168}...but I'd feel happier|if during my absence you would wear this.
{94192}{94271}Please don't ask me why,|but just wear it for my sake.
{94338}{94412}- Arthur, I...|- Please, Mina.

{95359}{95442}You said Lucy would lead us to Dracula.|Why didn't I listen to you?
{95444}{95484}This would never have happened.

{95595}{95643}We'll give her every protection we can.
{95645}{95686}Tonight we'll watch the windows|of her room.

The ghosts are moving tonight.
Restless, hungry.
May I introduce myself?
I am Watson Pritchard.
In just a minute I'll show you the only really haunted house... in the world.
Since it was built a century ago, seven people, including my brother, have been murdered in it.
Since then, I have owned the house.
I've only spent one night there, and when they found me in the morning... I
I was almost dead.
I am Frederick Loren.
And I've rented the house on haunted hill tonight... so that my wife can give a party.
A haunted house party.
She's so amusing.
There'll be food and drink and ghosts, and perhaps even a few murders.
You're all invited.
If any of you will spend the next 12 hours in this house, I will give you each 10 thousand dollars.
Or your next-of-kin in case you don't survive.
Ah, but here come other guests.
It was my wife's idea... to have our guests come in funeral cars.
She's so amusing.
Her sense of humor is, shall we say... original.
I dreamed of the hearse, it's empty now, but after a night in the house of haunted hill.
Who knows?
This is Lance Schroeder, a test pilot.
So no doubt a brave man.
But don't you think you can be much braver if you're paid for it?
And I happen to know that Lance needs the 10.000 I'll give him.
If he is brave enough to stay all night.
This is Ruth Bridgers.
You've no doubt read her column in the newspapers.
She says her reason for coming to the party is to write a feature article on ghosts.
She's also desperate for money. Gambles.
You've already met Watson Pritchard.
A man living in mortal fear of a house and yet he is risking his life to spend another night here.
I wonder why.
He says it's for money.
This is Dr. David Trent.
A psychiatrist.
He claims that my ghosts will help his work... on hysteria.
But don't you see a little touch of greed there?
Around the mouth and eyes?
This is Nora Manning.
I picked her from the thousands of people who work for me... because she needed the 10 thousand more than most.
Supports her whole family.
Isn't she pretty?
The party is starting now and you have until midnight, to find the House on Haunted Hill.
HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL
Well, where is everybody?
It isn't a very warm welcome, is it?
Only the ghosts in this house are glad we're here.
Are we all strangers to each other?
Don't you two know each other?
I'm afraid I don't even know your name.
- I am Nora Manning.
- Lance Schroeder.
Is Frederick Loren a friend of yours?
I've heard of him, but I've never met him.
I work in one of his companies, but I've have never seen him.
I've never met the man either, just a phone call.
- Do you know him?
- No.
Well then, you're the only one of us who does.
I don't know him.
All the details about renting the house... were done by mail.
- He's quite wealthy, isn't he?
- Millions.
And five wives, I believe.
Four, I think so far.
A fifty thousand dollar party for only five people is a little steepy even for a millionaire.
Well, if I were going to haunt anybody this would most certainly be the house I'd do it, eh?
Who closed the door?
This thing is made of solid steel.
Annabelle?
Our guest are here and fortunately still alive.
Is your face on yet?
Dust and dirt everywhere.
The water barely trickles.
- Couldn't you have the place cleaned?
- Atmosphere, darling.
You know how ghosts are, they never tidy up.
Well, that's a very fetching outfit, but hardly suitable for a party.
I'm not going to the party.
Mm, "You Spend The Night Ghost
Party" was your idea, remember?
Since it's going to cost me $50,000 dollars, I want you to have fun.
The party was my idea until you invited all the guests.
Why all these strangers?
Why none of our friends?
Friends? Do we have any friends?
No. Your jealousy took care of that.
I had a reason for inviting each guest.
I wanted kind of a cross section, from psychiatrist to typist.
And from drunk to jet pilot.
They share one thing.
They all need money.
Now let's see if they're brave enough to earn it.
And you call this a party?
Could be.
Why do you always do that?
It spoils the champagne.
- It might explode.
- Never does.
Would you guarantee that?
- That isn't funny, Frederick.
- Would make a good headline.
Playboy kills wife with champagne cork.
- Would you join me?
- No, thank you.
Just a sip might improve your humor.
My humor is fine, thanks.
And I haven't poisoned it.
It's always good to know that.
Have some, you'll enjoy the party more.
Go on.
Your trust is so touching.
And I'm not going to the party.
Of all my wives, you are the least agreeable.
But still alive.
Would you go away for a million dollars in tax-free?
You want it all, don't you?
I deserve it all.
Your jealousy isn't tax free.
And your possessiveness is maddening.
If ever a man had grounds for divorce.
- But can't prove them.
- The time will come.
- You'll slip up one of these days.
- You think so?
If I live long enough.
You remember the fun we had when you poisoned me?
Something you ate, the doctor said.
Yes, arsenic on the rocks.
Annabelle...
You'd do it again if you thought you could get away with it, wouldn't you?
Darling, what makes you think that?
Something about you.
I hear that hanging is very uncomfortable, in case you get any more ideas.
Don't let the ghosts and the ghouls disturb you, darling.
Darling, the only ghoul in the house is you.
And don't sit up all night, thinking of ways to get rid of me.
It makes wrinkles.
This is what she used on my brother and her sister.
Hacked them to pieces.
We found parts of their bodies all over the house.
In places you wouldn't think.
The funny thing is the heads have never been found.
The hands and feet, and things like that... but no heads.
The wife, probably in a rage threatened her husband with a knife, and then, carried away by hysteria took a swing at him, and simply went on from there.
Well, she certainly went on. How many people did she kill, Mr. Pritchard?
Only two. Her husband and her sister.
No one else was here.
So there are two loose heads just floating around in here somewhere?
You can hear them at night.
They whisper to each other and then cry.
Since our host isn't here, would anyone care to mix me a drink?
Certainly, what will you have?
Good evening.
I'm your host, Frederick Loren.
Since we're all strangers to each other, let's get acquainted with a drink, shall we?
Mr. Loren.
I advise you to call this party off now.
The ghosts are already moving and that's a bad sign.
Let me apologize for my wife.
She will join us later.
- What do we have?
- Scotch with ice.
- Doctor?
- I'll have the same.
Now before the party begins, let's go over the details.
The caretakers will leave at midnight, locking us in here until they come back in the morning.
Once the door is locked, there is no way out.
The windows have bars that a jail would be proud of.
And the only door to the outside locks like a vault.
There is no electricity, no phone, no one within miles, so, no way to call for help.
Like a coffin.
So, if any of you decide not to stay for the party you must let me know before midnight.
Of course if you leave, I shan't be able to pay you anything.
I'm interest in your reason for this... party.
Besides some pleasant company.
Ghosts, doctor.
I think everyone wonders what they would do... if they saw a ghost.
And now my wife is giving us all the opportunity to find out.
Amusing. Ghosts, etc... being only creations of hysteria... your party should be a success.
So Pritchard here promises us genuine ghosts.
Seven now, maybe more before morning.
That's cheerful.
4 men have been murdered this house.
And 3 women.
You planned your party very well, Mr. Loren.
4 of us are men, 3 are women, there's a ghost for everybody.
So Pritchard, why don't you take us on a tour through the house... and let's see what happens, uh.
See that stain?
Blood.
A young girl was killed here.
And whatever got her wasn't human.
Don't stand there!
What do you mean? Where?
It's too late. They've marked you.
Ridiculous. The roof probably leaks.
Oh, that must be what it is.
Who would want to haunt me?
I would say any self-respecting male ghost.
I hope it doesn't come back.
Oh Mr. Pritchard, you are the life of the party.
Oh, he hasn't even started yet.
Wasn't there a man who threw his wife into a wine vat or something?
That was in the cellar.
There's been a murder almost every place in this house.
All this belonged to a Mr. Norton, who didn't die here.
He was electrocuted later.
Mr. Norton did a good deal of experimenting with wines.
But his wife didn't think it was any good.
So he filled a vat with acid and threw her in.
She was supposed to stay down, but the bones came up.
It's a funny thing, but none of the murders here were just ordinary.
Just shooting or stabbing...
They've all been sort of wild...
- violent and different.
- Look out!
Thank God, she didn't fall in.
You mean there's still acid in there?
Destroys everything with hair and flesh.
Just leaves the bones.
My, it's dry and dusty down here.
Because there is a cure for that, that stinks, come on.
How did you get invited to this party?
No. Let them go on.
I mean, what did he tell you?
Mr. Loren said everybody would get 10 thousand dollars.
But he didn't say anything about being locked in?
No.
He just made a deal with me on the phone.
But nothing about having to stay.
Aren't you going to stay?
If I don't, I lose
10 thousand dollars.
I'm going to stay, too.
- 10 thousand dollars.
- Yes.
Do you believe in ghosts?
I don't know.
Well, I believe in what that doc says you can spook yourself.
Not a complaint, seeing things that are not really there.
Or were they?
What do you do with your 10 thousand?
If we get it.
What do you mean "if we get it"?
Won't he pay us if we stay?
Oh I'm sure he will.
Ten thousand is no more to him than a nickle is for us.
We were in a automobile accident.
Now I am the only one in the family who can make any money.
Well, I have never seen so many doors.
Closet.
Bottles.
Does it go any where?
Lance!
Lance!
Help me! Please!
Lance is gone!
And there's a ghost!
- See what I mean?
- Please come on!
Did you say Lance is gone?
Gone where?
We'll have to break it down!
It's locked!
Locked?
Are you all right?
Nothing that money won't cure.
I must... have bumped my head.
The only way you could bump your head in here, is to run head on into the wall.
You didn't do that, did you?
Let's get a bandage on that.
I wonder why they didn't kill him?
Who?
He didn't bump his head, they hit him.
They?
Nora, when you came in, you said something about a ghost?
- There was something.
- What did it look like?
Well, it was wearing a black thing that went all the way to the floor.
Weren't you a little frightened at the time?
Oh, yes.
That, Mr. Loren, is hysteria.
Well, then doctor, how do you explain what happened to Lance?
Was that hysteria too?
You better get that checked in a day or two.
Thanks, doc.
Wait for me in the hall.
The ghosts are coming closer, Mr. Loren.
You really believe in your pet ghosts, don't you Pritchard?
Before the night's over, you will too.
- Would you like a drink, Lance?
- No, thanks.
I'd like one. Scotsman.
Mr. Loren, are you really going to pay anyone who stays all night?
Certainly, 10 thousand dollars.
Will there be much red tape, or delay?
- You're in a hurry, dear?
- Frankly, yes.
Or frantically.
Here you are, my dear.
Someone or something was in here when I came in, but where?
And if the door was locked, how did it get out?
What you saw might have been a ghost, Nora.
But what was in here with me, was no ghost.
I don't know, I was so scared.
That sound different to you?
Yes.
Three, six, nine, twelve.
12 feet.
Three, six.
Now I'm going to knock on the other wall.
When you hear me, you knock on this wall.
Tap lower down!
Oh, Lance! I saw it again!
- Where did it come from?
- From in here.
But if it ran out of here,
I'd have seen it.
Lance, it doesn't run, it just floats.
Yeah, but, why didn't I see it?
You don't believe me!
How can I?
I'm Annabelle Loren.
You must be Miss Manning.
I realize this is a very unusual and a very, very dull party.
Wouldn't you like to freshen up?
This is your room.
Depressing, isn't it?
I doubt if I'll spend much time here.
It's going to rain. The perfect atmosphere for my husband's party.
Why did you come here?
He said he'd give me
10 thousand dollars.
- Why did he pick you?
- I don't know.
My supervisor just came and said I've been invited.
How long have you known my husband?
I just met him tonight.
So...?
Why you?
What were you doing, wandering around by yourself?
Well, I was in the cellar with Lance.
Mr. Schroeder.
I just left, that's all.
Don't do it again.
Don't go anywhere in this house by yourself.
Go on, fix you face and I'll come by for you in a few minutes.
But I...
You're in danger.
We all are.
But who?
I hope for your sake, you'll never find out.
I am Annabelle Loren.
Are you looking for something?
Not exactly.
- Are you the doctor?
- No, I am Lance Schroeder.
- The pilot. You've hurt yourself?
- Oh, it's just a bump on the head.
- Which is my room?
- I believe this is it.
Thank you, Mrs. Loren.
Annabelle, Lance.
You were with the young girl in the cellar.
- Why was she so upset?
- Was she?
And you don't look like the type to go around bumping your head.
What did it really happened, Lance?
Well, Nora thought she saw a ghost, but I didn't see anything.
She was just frightened then?
And mad at me I think.
I kidded her about it.
I wouldn't joke about anything else that happens here tonight.
Now don't tell me that you're taking all this seriously.
Aren't you?
Well, I'd like to find out what hit me.
Lance...
If I need help, may I count on you?
Yeah, sure, I guess so.
Look, what's going on here anyway?
I mean what is with this party business?
This is no party.
He is planning something.
- Your husband?
- I don't think he really was.
Must be pretty big if he is going to lay out 50 thousand.
Money doesn't mean anything.
He has a reason for getting us all up here to this dreadful old house.
Well what for?
He doesn't even knows us.
Maybe that's exactly why you're here?
Well, what can he get away with?
Oh, he thinks his big money like his can getaway with anything.
You know of course that I'm his fourth wife.
The first simply disappeared.
The other two died.
Lance,
I don't want to join them.
You mean he...
All his doctors said they died of heart attacks.
- Two girls in their twenties.
- Well, what can he do?
My husband is sometimes insane with jealousy.
Nothing matters to him anymore.
Please be careful.
Would he hurt you?
He would kill me if he could.
Annabelle, you're missing all the fun.
Nora Manning was almost killed by a falling chandelier.
The pilot bashed his head in.
Is he badly hurt?
The saturnine psychiatrist bandaged him up.
Don't you want to go and console him?
As you do with most men in your fashion.
You are so clever, Frederick.
Since I lie awake at nights, wondering why I married you.
It was rather a mistake.
You didn't marry me, dear.
I married you.
Unpleasant, but no mistake.
Hurry up.
Frederick, for last time,
I'm not going to your party.
And for last time, it's not my party, but yours.
And you are going.
- I am not.
- You ready dear?
- No.
- Are you ready dear?
Yes, damn you.
Would you adore me as much if I was poor?
No, thought you wanted to be as a lovely widow.
It's almost time to lock up the house.
Then your party will really begin.
I wonder how it will end.
- It's close to midnight, Lance.
- Okay, I'll be down in a minute.
- Who is it?
- Your host, my dear.
It's almost midnight, Nora.
We're all going to get together down in the living room.
Alright Mr. Loren,
I'll be right down.
Come with us.
Come with us, before he kills you.
Where is Nora? Miss Manning?
I don't want to stay here!
Nora, what happened?
That's Jonas Slydes and his wife.
They have been caretakers here for years.
She's blind, you know?
I'm not going to stay here!
Well doctor, it looks like we have a real case of hysteria on our hands.
Oh, I thinks she's just a little upset, not hysterical.
Good evening.
Hello, my dear.
This is my wife.
These are our guests.
Ruth Bridgers.
Dr. Trent.
You know Watson Pritchard, of course.
Nora Manning and...
This is Lance Schroeder.
Get me out of here!
Now what about the 10 thousand?
I don't care. He wants to kill me.
Who wants to kill you?
Mr. Loren.
May I have your attention, please.
I think you all remember the bargain we made about staying all night.
10 thousand dollars apiece.
If any of you don't survive,
50 thousand dollars will be divided amongst the rest of you.
If I should die...
You will be paid by my estate.
When the door is locked from the outside by the caretakers, we'll all be forced to to stay in this house until morning.
If any of you decide not to stay... you must leave with the caretakers now.
You won't have a chance to change your minds later because there'll be no way to get out.
- I don't want to stay!
- Wait.
It isn't midnight yet.
Who told them they could leave?
They never leave before midnight.
Well, they've gone now.
I was going to ask you whether you wanted to stay or not... but it seems that the caretakers have made the decision for you.
We're all locked in now.
But I don't want to stay.
I sorry my dear, but it's too late now.
Darling, haven't you had enough of this silly game?
Get some cars up here for these people and let them go home.
But pay them first.
This is your party, remember?
In spite of my wife's faith in my ability to do the impossible, we will all have to stay in this house until eight o'clock in the morning.
But we have some party favors for you... in these little coffins.
This is my wife's idea and I must say I think it's rather dangerous.
I suppose you all know how to use one of this things but in case you don't... you just press down on this lever with your thumb and then pull the trigger.
You see, they're loaded.
These are no good against the dead, only the living.
Doctor.
Lance.
Nora.
Go ahead, take it.
Miss Bridgers.
- And here is yours, dear.
- I don't need it.
It was your idea.
Who knows, you may want to use it on me before this night is over.
Throw these guns away, they won't do you any good.
I agree with Pritchard on that point although not for the same reason.
Dr. Trent... don't you approve of our little party favors?
Suppose Nora had had a gun when she mistook the blind woman for a ghost.
I don't think anyone else is going to walk around in total darkness.
Oh, I'm sure we're not going to go running round the house shooting each other, aren't you?
Who knows? Fear makes people do amazing things.
Mr. Pritchard, you said your sister-in-law killed a man and woman here and cut them up.
You said they found hands and feet, but they never found any heads.
Would you like to see one of those heads?
Would you all like to see one of those heads?
Okay, just follow me!
Darling, I really don't need this.
Just go look in my suitcase.
Just go, look.
But it was in there! A woman's head!
Nora, I think you're a little upset.
Would you care for a sedative?
Get out! Get out all of you!
All of you get out of here and leave me alone!
Just get out of here!
You think it's alright to leave her by herself, doctor?
I wished she'd taken the sedative.
Well, what do you suppose she thought she saw?
They're closing in on her.
Look Doc, I think somebody ought to stay with her.
There could be a million people around her but if they wanted her, they'd get her.
What if he's right?
He's too drunk to know what he's talking about.
I wonder. I'll join you in a minute.
Do you think it would do any good if you went in and talk to her?
Would you think there really was a head in her suitcase?
I don't know.
Something like that would put me right over the edge.
Well, could you sort of stay up here,
I mean, in case she needs help?
All right. I'll be in my room.
Just call if you need.
Thanks.
Are you sure there are only seven people in this house?
Positive, except for the ghosts.
I don't believe in ghosts nor in frightening women.
In Nora's case, it's gone far enough.
Perhaps too far.
What do you suggest we do about it, doctor?
Don't frighten her any more!
Nora?
Nora?
Nora?
Nora!
Nora!
What do you know about this?
They've taken her. In a little while she'll be one of them.
Where is Nora?
Where is she?
It's too late.
You'll never find her again.
Pritchard, if you know where she is, you'd better tell me now!
She's gone! She's gone with them!
And there's nothing you can do about it.
Nora.
Take it down!
Nora?
She is dead, Mr. Loren.
Your wife hanged herself.
Suicide.
- Lance!
- Nora!
Lance, hide, please hide.
- What's the matter?
- Hide!
He tried to kill me.
He grabbed me and choked me and put me in that room.
And then he went away and left me.
Who?
He thought I was dead.
Who?
Mr. Loren.
Are you sure about this?
I don't know. It... it was dark, but it must have been him.
Has anybody seen you since he left you?
I heard some people in that room, but I went by and nobody saw me.
Mrs. Loren is dead.
But how?
Loren said she committed suicide.
But I think somebody killed her.
Him?
I'm sure you've come to the same conclusion I have.
Yeah. I think so.
Let's all have a meeting and discuss what to do.
- The living room?
- Okay. In a minute.
I've got to go downstairs.
Now you lock yourself in here and don't let anybody know you're here.
If he thinks you're dead he won't come here.
And I'll get back as soon as I can.
You'll be alright.
And if you have to... you use it.
So beautiful.
So greedy.
So cold.
- What are you doing in here?
- Wait, don't we...
What do you mean, coming in here?
- I don't want them to take her away.
- You're drunk.
- They will if you don't watch her.
- You're drunk!
Alright I'll put it, Pritchard!
Why did you come into this room?
- I'm the only one who understands.
- Understands what?
Your wife isn't there anymore, she's already joined them.
Now Pritchard, I've had enough of your spook talk.
Get out you sot, and don't come back into this room again!
Where is what's her name...?
Nora?
I didn't disturb her since I don't think this concerns her.
Now you're right.
Mr. Loren, isn't there some way we can get out of this house now?
No. None at all.
We could try breaking out.
The only door to the outside is made of steel.
The bars at the windows are set in solid stone.
We gotta stay.
I'm not afraid of your ghosts, Pritchard.
But I am afraid.
When we came here a few hours ago, the only thing we had in common was the 10 thousand dollars we'd get.
Now however we share something else.
The death of Mrs. Loren.
So far tonight, one of us was almost killed by a falling chandelier.
One of us was mysteriously slugged.
One of us is being driven to the brink of absolute hysteria.
And one of us is dead.
Were these accidents? Suicide?
And we must stay here for six more hours?
6 hours?
Six of us.
- Time enough.
- Who will be next?
How will it happen?
Let me ask you a question doctor.
You were the first one to see my wife dead.
Did you also see anything that she could have climbed up on
- and then jumped?
- No.
Did any of you?
There was nothing.
How then did she get up there?
- So high,
- Exactly, Mr. Loren, how?
She couldn't have pulled herself up there.
She couldn't have dropped from the ceiling.
Do you think your wife killed herself?
No.
She was murdered.
By one of you.
Or you, Mr. Loren.
To deliberately kill someone you must have a reason.
We were all strangers to your wife.
Only you had a motive for murder.
What husband hasn't at some time wanted to kill his wife?
What husband hasn't had a thousand opportunities to do it in such a way so that he'd never be suspected.
I'm not such a fool as to hang my wife from a ceiling by a rope.
The fact remains that you or one of us murdered Mrs. Loren.
- And that's the matter for the police.
- So, how do we get the police?
That's my point.
We can't until morning.
What began as a silly party given by an eccentric, has now involved us all in murder.
For once Pritchard may be right.
If another murder is in the works, let's stop it now.
- Another murder?
- Why not?
Maybe one of us saw much.
Why should even a millionaire want to give each of us 10 thousand dollars to spend one night in a gloomy old house?
To see some ghosts and have a party?
- No.
- Have you finished trying me, doctor?
And is the verdict guilty of murder?
No, this isn't getting us anywhere.
Somebody killed
Mrs. Loren, we know that.
One of us is guilty and the rest of us are innocent. Okay.
Now what we have to do for the next six hours is to protect ourselves... from each other.
- Do you really think...?
- I don't think anything.
I just know that I'm going to my room.
And if anybody comes in,
I'll shoot him... or her.
And if we all stay in our rooms... we'll be safe.
Because the innocent will have no reason to leave his room, and the guilty will admit his guilt if he or she does.
- And we all have guns.
- Then we are all agreed?
Oh I wish this night were over.
Rooms? Guns?
I tell you it doesn't make any difference.
They are through with us here.
What's the use of saying good night?
Good night.
Good night, doctor.
Nora, it's me, Lance.
Are you okay?
They've all gone into their rooms, and locked themselves in.
Lance, I've been thinking.
It was so dark there below.
Maybe it wasn't Mr. Loren.
It was him, alright. He tried to kill you and he did kill his wife.
- How can you be so sure?
- She tried to warn me.
Asked me to help her.
The doc thinks he is going to try and kill one of us.
Now there must be a way out of this place and I'm going to find it and get the police before he does.
I'm going with you.
But if he finds out you're alive...
No, Nora, you're safer here than any place else.
Now just lock yourself in and keep quiet.
If I find a way out,
I'll come back and get you.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Lance!
An admission of guilt, doctor?
Certainly not. There's either somebody else in this house or one of us has left his room.
Did you hear anything?
- Organ music?
- That and someone walking.
You got yours?
Ready?
You look downstairs and I'll look up here.
Why not together?
We maybe only minutes, seconds left to someone's life.
Why waste time?
It's almost over darling.
Every detail was perfect.
- What's happening?
- We've done it.
The perfect crime. Beautiful.
Has she killed him?
Not yet.
But she will.
Get me out of this hanging harness.
What's taking that girl so long?
What time is it?
At first I couldn't get Nora to want to protect herself with a gun.
But after you appeared at the window everything began to work just as we had planned.
You were wonderful.
Just the touch which finally drove her into complete hysteria.
It will be worth all of our planning, darling.
Where is Nora now?
- What's happening?
- On her way to the cellar.
So scared, she'll shoot the first thing that moves.
- And Frederick?
- On his way to the cellar too.
David, are you sure none of them will suspect us?
Of what?
An hysterical girl accidentally shoot somebody?
Who would suspect that we planned it that way?
- That we drove her to it.
- What about my suicide?
For just a ghost party gag.
We'll claim it was a dummy since
I merely want to touch you.
And the caretakers?
Well, they had no idea what they were really doing.
What about Nora?
She's not stupid you know.
Darling, believe me. Everything we planned is working perfectly.
Nora is sure Frederick murdered you.
She can spread Frederick attacked her the cellar, not me.
And now Nora is almost out of her mind with fear.
The heads, the music, your hanging.
I tell you, when Frederick walks in there, she'll shoot him.
It's taking too long.
David, you ought to be there.
When you hear the shot come down to the cellar.
Nora! No!
David?
David.
At last you've got it all.
Everything I have, even my life.
But you're not going to live to enjoy it.
Come with me murderess, come with me.
Good night, doctor.
Good night, Annabelle.
The crime you two planned was indeed perfect.
Only the victim is alive and the murderers are not.
It's a pity you didn't know when started your game of murder that I was playing too.
There must be some way to get in here!
It's right along here, some what.
Lance!
I've shot Mr. Loren!
He's down in the wine cellar.
- Alive?
- I don't think so.
It's him! He's alive!
You didn't shoot anyone, my dear.
I loaded your gun with blanks.
I can tell you all now...
Trent and my wife were planning to kill me.
They failed.
Trent tried to throw me in the vat.
My wife stumbled and fell.
I'm ready for justice to decide if I'm innocent or guilty.
Now there are nine.
There'll be more, many more.
They're coming for me now.
And then they will come for you.
GODZILLA RAIDS AGAIN
Base, Base, this is airplane Keichi calling.
I am at 136 degrees east, 34 degrees north, making my final pass over the sea. Over.
Airplane Keichi, airplane Keichi, this is base. Roger, roger.
You have made your final pass over the fishing lanes, over.
Roger, roger. This is airplane Keichi reporting.
Base, Base, this is airplane Keichi reporting.
I've made my third pass. How are things? Over.
Roger, roger. Don't you have anything else to say?
Hidemi, are you going somewhere tonight?
Roger, Roger. I should be available tomorrow.
We can use my papa's car.
Hidemi, it must be nice to be the boss's daughter.
Patience, Patience.
You'll get lucky soon.
Until I do, tell me everything!
You can put money on it!
Base, Base! This is Kobayashi, Kobayashi!
I'm having engine trouble. I have engine trouble.
Kobayashi, Kobayashi, this is base.
Do you know what it is? Do you know what it is?
It happened while passing the southern islands.
Oh, my engine has stalled.
Engine stall! Engine stall! I'm going down!
Kobayashi! Kobayashi! Respond!
Kobayashi! Kobayashi!
Emergency! Emergency! Kobayashi's plane is going down. We need you to assist him!
What? Kobayashi?
Roger, Roger.
I'll start looking for him right away!
Papa!
- What? You shouldn't barge in here!
Kobayashi's plane has gone down
- What? What did you say?
HEY! HEY! HEY!
Hey! Hey!
Base Base! This is Tsukioka! I've spotted
Kobayashi's plane. I'm going to try to pick him up.
Roger, roger. Be careful!
- Tsukioka, please try!
How are you? Are you injured?
I'm fine. I'm just happy that you came out to help me so quickly.
From the sound of it, the girls back at the base were pretty worried.
What? Those crazy ladies were concerned about me?
This place hasn't affected your head!
Run Kobayashi!
Godzilla! I'm sure that's Godzilla!
Godzilla?
Hey, let's run for it!
Ah, here it is.
- He's right.
Really?
Well Yamane, it seems that our belief turned out to be real, huh?
Our darkest dreams have come back to greet us.
Then you think this is another Godzilla?
Yes. Godzilla was created from a hydrogen bomb.
Now, it may have affected an Angilosaurus.
Angilosaurus?
Yes. This is an Angilosaurus.
The Angilosaurus, otherwise known as the monster
Angilas, is roughly 70 to 150 million years old.
It was one of the stronger dinosaurs that lived in the prehistoric era.
Of course, Godzilla was also alive during that time. May I...?
What we know about them comes from Poland's world animal specialist, Professor Plateli Hondon.
Let me read it to you.
Angilas is about 150 to 200 feet tall and it is also a carnivore.
This behavior is typical for a creature this large.
However, one thing makes Angilas very different from other creatures from its time...
Its behavior shows it was smart in how it employed its body.
To continue, its chest and abdomen were its only vulnerable areas.
However, Angilas is one of the few creatures that had a thorough hatred for war-like predators.
The two must have fought since the beginning and now its come back from Godzilla's past.
It's a terrible thing to say, but we may not have anything that can oppose Angilas.
Next, Professor Yamane, who flew in from Tokyo will speak on our Godzilla countermeasures.
Well, I would tell you about the Godzilla countermeasures, but I regret that we have no effective strategy for it.
There are no policies that will stop Godzilla.
I have no methods to tell you at this time.
I came here from Tokyo to show you films that we have collected after Godzilla's attack on Tokyo.
I was hoping that we may be able to decide on some effective countermeasures after we review this data.
Well then...
Now, to repeat, we used our weapons and our concentrated strategies.
A fearful combination... Yet the vast attack could not drive Godzilla away from us.
But professor, we killed
Godzilla once before...
Yes, with the Oxygen Destroyer. That Godzilla is at the bottom of Tokyo bay due to the Oxygen Destroyer.
All the information related to that invention is gone.
The despair caused by Godzilla's rampage cannot be helped.
Professor, is this
Godzilla on its own?
Yes, but we have another that we must face.
This time, Godzilla has emerged together with this new threat, Angilas.
Now we must wonder if this new menace is connected to the hydrogen bomb.
But professor, they were set for minimal destruction.
Yes, I shouldn't give you my own theory now.
This discussion is to confirm our present situation.
Yet, we should consider the effects it may have had to some of nature's inhabitants.
We should thoroughly examine the cause.
From that, we should focus on the circumstances should it come ashore in Tokyo.
Godzilla was sensitive to the emergency lights.
Using them made it extremely violent.
Then the hydrogen bomb's glare must have awakened it, I imagine.
The light may make it that way due to some mysterious habit.
Well, I believe there could be a way to reverse this habit.
We should drop a light bomb near
Godzilla's path, so it can lure it away.
At this point, I don't believe it will produce a very bad result, but it's all we have to work with for now.
Osaka will be alright, won't it?
Well, I'm not sure what will happen to Tokyo.
It's so quiet, don't you think it's awful?
Yes, I'm not used to it being so quiet.
Well, do you think Tokyo stands a chance?
Idiot! Don't tell me that's what you believe too?
They'll pull through it.
Then, that's great.
When this is over, you can see it for yourself.
Oh, really?
They must be beginning.
The search for Godzilla is continuing.
Last night's search was unsuccessful.
Its whereabouts are still unknown.
Every available plane is to diligently pursue it until all routes have been completely exhausted...
...or its current position and movement have been reported to base. Over.
Where do you think Godzilla could be heading?
It could be at the bottom of the ocean, moving along the earth's crust in numerous directions.
If it's traveling down there this time, there's no way to tell which way it could be going.
So, we won't know its location.
Command, command.
This is aircraft 54, aircraft 54.
At 15:24 hours, Godzilla has been spotted on radar in the ocean at north 34 degrees, east 130 degrees.
We will continue to follow on radar. Over.
Command. Command. This is Frigate T-10.
At 15:32 hours, we have tracked Godzilla to east 134 degrees, north 33 degrees. Maintaining pursuit, over.
This is command, this is command.
We have confirmation at east 134.5 degrees, north 34.3 degrees.
Professor, Godzilla is moving from this area.
Really? Have the planes reach it here and send our fourth fleet in pursuit.
From military command, this is the three o'clock announcement.
Today the 4th southern fleet was ordered to a state of urgent readiness.
After a lengthy search, Godzilla was discovered traveling on a northeast course.
In the middle of the night, the 4th southern fleet will inevitably pinpoint its position and surround it.
Please continue listening for immediate updates should it reach the coastline. Repeating...
Boss, with Godzilla loose in that area...
We'll have to stay grounded for a while.
Certainly we'll also have to reduce our factory output to accommodate for it.
Yeah, I wish they would drop this light bomb and get it over with!
Hey, this is a big undertaking. It's not a small problem that you can...
It's the same as the time when you fell ill after eating all that fish!
May I have your attention please. Everyone in the
Osaka area is asked to head calmly to the shelters.
At 19:30 hours, military command has announced
Godzilla's course tracked by the 4th southern fleet.
At the moment, its present course will bring it towards the coastline of Osaka.
In order to test the light bomb, we will need to extinguish every light in the entire city.
Hey, what's that?!
The civilians of this ward are in the shelters.
- The shelters report that all is well.
Good.
All military units, all military units. Please assist in evacuating all civilians to the emergency shelters.
All military units, all military units...
Oh, Tsukioka. The boss has gone to the factory.
What? The factory?
Yes, he wants us to meet him there.
Really? Alright.
Well Hidemi, I think you'll be safe enough in the house while we're away.
Yes. You be careful.
Hey, let's go!
- Goodbye, Hidemi!
Tsukioka, Take care of papa.
- Goodbye!
At the moment, Godzilla is being lured away with the military's light bombs.
It is gradually being drawn away from approaching Osaka's coastline.
In order to protect our lives and property, please continue maintaining the Osaka city blackout.
Boss! Boss! Godzilla is moving away from the docks without incident!
This saves Osaka and Godzilla any trouble.
Right. It was too close for comfort.
Hey, sit down! Hey!
Hey, what's wrong?
It looks like one of your friends is sick.
Him? Again?
Stop the car!
Hurry! Hurry! Move! Move!
Halt!
Freeze!
- Stay Where you are!
Hey, over here!
Stop!
Criminals are in that truck!
Damn!
What's that?
That's Angilas!
Angilas?
Boss! Boss! Let's get away from this disaster!
Boss, let's go!
So, Godzilla wasn't lured away with light bombs.
You would think that it had a chance.
Boss! Let's get out of here!
Hurry! Hurry!
Boss, you can't expect any more!
So, let's go...
That way!
What? Really?
Evacuate! Evacuate! Evacuate!
After the ferocious attack by the monster Godzilla, the greatest disaster of this century is over.
But, please let me repeat, our love for peace in the world must be set aside to combat against Godzilla.
For the good of us all, we should consider the idea of using a hydrogen bomb against Godzilla.
Godzilla is a violent creature. I believe we must make the proper defenses.
Angilas was defeated by Godzilla, but not before destroying this once quiet city.
Shibashi, that smoke is rising from the area where my factory once stood.
The damage is much worse than I imagined.
Shibashi, I'm going to rebuild it.
I want you to be my partner.
Have you decided on a location for it?
I'm told that Hokkaido is a nice place to operate from.
Oh, will you be going with us?
Miss, I'm in a hurry to fly out this morning.
Boss! They're not sure about
Godzilla's whereabouts.
The marine authority hasn't discovered its current position yet.
Really? Good job!
We will do our best to look for it.
Kobayashi, you lived in Hokkaido, right?
Huh? Hokkaido?
The vice president and I were discussing how our firm's ships could operate from a useless port.
For some time we've thought about a plan to relocate the factory to the Hokkaido area.
I understand. You want me to fly a plane up there to survey locations.
Thank you. I was hoping you'd do it.
- Yes, sir.
Papa, then we'll still have our station jobs?
No, but yourjobs with the firm will be transferred once we move.
Oh, I see.
Until we go to Hokkaido, shape this place up for the time being.
Okay, okay.
Hidemi, you have my sympathy. Your long awaited wedding ceremony was ruined by Godzilla.
Maybe, but my fiancee has come this far,
I'm sure he's still very patient, huh?
I give up! Okay, we'd better hurry and get to
Hokkaido so our bridegroom doesn't reconsider.
Like you wouldn't have your hand in such a wicked operation.
Kobayashi, you'll find out that women are different than fish.
I'll wait, thanks!
Well, this official timekeeper has to head to
Hokkaido in order to make a purchase.
Ten thousand pardons.
This from an incompetent man.
You bastard!
Boss, I haven't found out where our bridegroom has gone to yet.
Well, you did your best. What place does our man have for us this time?
Our man thinks this area might hold something for us.
Oh really? Well, if our bridegroom wants me to go there...
This is his ninth choice. He must be willing to wait a while...
Aye, sir.
Be careful bridegroom!
- Who me?
Captain! Captain, we've just received our next destination.
42 degrees north, 146 degrees east.
That's it alright.
Kobayashi has come out to greet us!
- You're right! Hey! Hey!
Well... oh, hey, hey!
- Yes sir?
Going out nine times has been a difficult task.
Let's break our arrangements for tonight and call the local restaurant to set up a party.
Right!
Save some for me.
Is he hungry?
- What's the matter? Hey!
Kobayashi, Kobayashi!
This is base, this is base.
Yes, this is Kobayashi.
Kobayashi, return home immediately.
Return home.
Is this Hidemi?
- Of course. We're waiting for you.
Really? Tsukioka too?
- Yes. He's with Papa in his airplane.
Hmm? I'll wait.
Hey, Kobayashi...
- Oh, you're there?
Yes. We have our first settlement in
Osaka and we need a fast plane.
Really? Have you met this person before?
- Me? Who?
The nice person...
- What? The nice person?
Kobayashi, who are you referring to?
The one he's meeting.
- Hey, will you tell me?
Himitsu!
- Pervert! He's not seeing her!
Oh, that would be horrible!
Hey, who could it be?
Well, who would he know in Hokkaido?
Hey, who is it?
An old companion.
Hey, Okami!
Okami!
The service here stinks!
Oh, bridegroom! Everyone is waiting this way!
- Okay, okay!
Hey, Tsukioka! It's me! It's me!
It's you guys! How are you doing?
You look great!
They went to the same college in his younger days.
My old boss!
Tsukioka! You're the reason that I'm at this place?
I heard that someone I knew was getting married.
What a pleasant surprise!
It's the least I can do!
Let's go inside for a toast!
Please come with us, Mrs...
- Hey, hey. You're as quick as ever with the ladies!
Get inside!
I'm going to talk to someone.
Tsukioka, have another!
- No, that's enough.
What? You bastard, are you already limiting yourself to a woman's level of drinking?
I'm sorry.
Kobayashi, lets have a drink.
- Yes sir!
Thank you.
It sounds like they're finished.
- Yes sir.
Ah, bridegroom!
- It's alright. I'm with the party.
Hey bridegroom!
- You're late!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
Kobayashi, I think it's very strange.
Why do you let them call you "bridegroom"?
That funny name was given to me.
- Is it really a nickname?
Yes, for the moment...
You're not going to let me find out are you, bridegroom?
Here are all the single...
- Oh, let me look!
Not yet! Not at this time!
You evil man!
Excuse me. Kobayashi, Tsukioka, our secondary ship has sank into the sea!
It sank, you say?
The only possible explanation is Godzilla.
Godzilla?
You go to the Marine Authority.
- Yes, sir!
Excuse me.
Why do you say that it's Godzilla?
This gentleman filed the report.
- Yes.
Our secondary ship notified us of their discovery of Godzilla by wireless radio.
But at the same time, the S.O.S. It was transmitting was abruptly cut off.
Ikeda!
- Yes, sir!
Notify the emergency center immediately!
- Yes, sir!
Tajima!
- Yes, sir!
You will leave for the Maritime
Authority first thing tomorrow!
Yes, sir!
This is base, this is base.
Any luck, Tsukioka?
This is Tsukioka. We haven't discovered
Godzilla's location yet. Over.
The weather is turning bad. Our bosses think you should return home. Over.
Tell the bosses I'm continuing. Present location is, 50 degrees north, 147.3 degress east.
Well, you don't have to be the one to find it!
Don't get lost in a fantasy! Please come home!
Aye, Aye. Don't worry about me.
This is base, this is base.
Do you read me, Tsukioka?
This is Tsukioka.
Tell the bosses I'm still searching.
Tsukioka! Tsukioka!
Return home at once!
Jackass!
Hidemi, could you tell me what gifts you two would like?
Is today bad?
What do you want me to tell you?
Hey what kind of girl stuff would you want?
No, if today isn't good for you...
I understand. Well, I'll tell you.
No, I can't. I don't want your feelings hurt.
- Then you want me to stop?
No, but I may not like what I hear.
Girl stuff, huh?
What color would I like?
I'm not sure. It's a...?
- Handbag.
A handbag, huh?
A watch.
- A watch? That's expensive.
Stockings are good.
Hey, how many am I allowed?
You're dangerous!
It's not bad if you wanted me to tell you!
That Tsukioka is late!
This is Tsukioka! This is Tsukioka!
I found Godzilla and I am in pursuit. Over.
Roger, roger! Listen,
I beg you, be careful!
Tsukioka! Are you alright on your own?
I'll be home soon.
Idiot! I'm coming out there!
What are your coordinates?
140.8 degrees east, 53 degrees north, near
Shinko Island. Godzilla is heading there.
Alright, I've got it! I'll meet you there!
- Kobayashi!
Do me a favor. Be careful, ok?
- Roger!
Use this time to decide on what the best gift for you would be.
Yes, I'll decide.
If you please...
Godzilla is presently headed for Shinko Island!
Godzilla is presently headed for Shinko Island!
Tajima!
- Yes, sir!
Prepare to load our planes with bombs!
- Yes, sir!
Anyway, Godzilla came through this opening from the ocean. That much I'm sure of.
What if we bomb here? I think that would leave Godzilla with no way out.
Alright. We'll drop bombs to prevent it from using that as an exit.
Ikeda!
- Yes, sir!
Refuel the planes with gasoline as soon as they land.
- Yes sir!
Tajima!
- Yes, sir!
Prepare to load the planes.
- Yes, sir!
You bastard!
This is Kobayashi! This is Kobayashi!
Godzilla is moving towards the sea passage.
Hurry up with those planes! Over.
The Air Force planes should be arriving in the vicinity around 15:12.
Roger, roger!
Damn! He'll get away!
All planes, attack!
Tajima, the attack didn't do it.
Damn!
Hey, Tajima! That's it! That's it! Bury it in the ice! Bury Godzilla in the ice!
Right! Drop your bombs on the icecaps! Create an avalanche!
Papa!
What's wrong, Hidemi?
It's Kobayashi.
What? Kobayashi?
Yes, he didn't make the second pass.
Really? Kobayashi...?
It's just... he didn't want to be left out of the action.
It's no use!
Alright, we'll hit the mountainside with a rocket!
Our first wave of rockets immobilized it for now. Return to base to reload so we can finish Godzilla!
Alright. We can trigger a larger avalanche hitting this spot. There's no other way.
But, this is a very difficult attack, okay?
- Yes, sir!
If we come in from this area, the explosions will level the entire mountainside.
Our first attack immobilized Godzilla. Our second attack will bury it completely!
We'll bring these mountain peaks down upon it!
These are two difficult tasks we ask of you, but we shall pull through and we will be successful!
Alright?
- Yes sir!
We are finished loading the rockets.
Okay, let's get going immediately.
- Yes, sir!
We're going!
Tajima, please let me go too! I have to go along with you. I beg you!
Tsukioka, isn't your life with yourjob?
My mind is made up.
Hey, bring the drums out!
Hey! Hurry before Godzilla can escape!
Hurry! Hurry!
Hurry! Hurry!
They're late.
Look out! All units,
Fall back! Fall back!
Hurry up troops! Hey look out!
Fall back! Hurry!
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
Alright, fire!
Hey, aren't they here yet?
That fire will only last three minutes!
Hey, they're coming!
- They're coming?
It's working! That did it!
- Son of a bitch! Do it again!
Damn! Alright...
Be careful, third squad!
Damn!
They did it! They did it!
Kobayashi...
We got Godzilla for you...
The word ''lycanthropy'' is defined as
a human being having the power
of becoming a wolf, or of having the power
of turning another human into a wolf.
Some say lycanthropy stems from
nothing but myth and superstition.
Yet the belief that a human
can turn into a wolf
has persisted since the Dark Ages
to this very day.
It is a universal belief.
The ancient Romans and Greeks
wrote of the phenomenon.
There are tales of such happenings
in Borneo, Turkey, South America.
Everywhere.
The American Navajo Indians
and other tribes tell stories about wolf-men.
The legends have persisted from
the beginnings of man's memory of time.
Why?
Why haven't these tales died?
The tales that say wolf-men roam the earth.
Nothing smaller?
Hey, mister.
Your change.
You a stranger in Mountaincrest?
You don't know me? l've never seen you before in my life. l guess l'm just passing through.
You guess? l'll be right back.
Yeah, you'd better make sure.
You didn't pay for your drinks yet.
-Hey, bud.
-Yes?
You left Chad's sudden-like.
Could you tell me, do l live in this town?
You didn't get that crocked on just one drink.
How's about you coming back and buying me a couple?
No, l think there is something l must do. l'm broke, friend.
You got almost twenty bucks. l saw it.
How about just handing it over?
Why? Why should l? l'm in a hurry. l don't like talk.
So now we don't have any more talk, huh?
Just give me the money.
Ma Everett!
What in blue blazes you yelling like that?
-lt came out of the alley!
-lt? What do you mean, it?
Two men were fighting.
They were in the alley.
Only that thing came out.
Let's take a look.
Well, you're the deputy sheriff, you go first.
You girls wait here.
Hoxie!
His throat.
Hoxie...
Only an animal could do that to a man's throat.
Hank, go get Doc Jonas!
Now, who was it, Ma?
Who went in the alley with Joe? l don't know. l never saw him before.
Hoxie, you got any guns at your place?
-l got a couple of deer guns.
-Well, go get them.
-Min, you tell Jack Haines.
-But, honey, l'm scared.
Yeah, l know. But l want the sheriff to know. l'll go with you. Come on. l'll drop you off on the way, Ma.
Hey, look at them tracks.
Yeah. Nobody would run across that field unless they were trying to get away.
Come on.
There.
Those are wolf tracks. l seen them in Canada.
Oh, there ain't ever been wolves around here.
Do you suppose some animal got the guy?
The snow doesn't show any signs of a fight.
Just his shoe marks.
And then... Then those. l'll tell you something else.
Whatever made those tracks was walking on two legs.
Well, l ain't going any further.
This is a job for the sheriff.
You think it's as simple as that, Hoxie?
Just another job for the law? l don't know what l think.
Mack, you go back with Hoxie.
You tell Jack Haines exactly where l am.
At the top of Pearson's land, where it goes up the hill.
You ain't staying here by yourself.
Do as l say. l'm a deputy and l get paid.
This is no job for you.
Just don't waste any time and get Jack out here quick.
Clovey, there's no sense...
Look, l've got a gun.
Nobody's gonna bother me. Now, get going.
Go on, get going. That's an order. l tell you, we should've never let Clovey stay up there by himself.
You heard him. He gave us an order.
All right. Stop arguing. lt wasn't your responsibility, either of you.
Look, have a drink on me, huh?
Hey, they're coming!
The sheriff and Clovey.
Clovey! l don't want you breathing a word about what happened tonight to anyone.
Understand? Nobody. l don't want this getting around the town before we know what it's all about.
-Sure, Jack. Sure.
-Min, Cora? l'm scared to even think about it.
-l won't talk.
-Me, neither.
You see the thing, Clovey?
Get back inside the bar, all of you.
Just stay sober enough to keep your mouths closed.
-Clovey. You, too?
-He's been hurt pretty bad, Amy.
-Can Doc get on it right away?
-Yes. Come in here.
How's Joe Mitchell?
He was dead when they brought him here.
My uncle's got him in the other room until they can get the undertaker up here in the morning from Larken. l'll get my uncle.
Thanks.
Feel like telling me about it?
Well, there's not much to tell, Jack.
The thing didn't make a sound.
All of a sudden, it was clawing and ripping at me.
And l yell and you fired that shot and the thing took off.
You know, it's a good thing you came along when you did.
Ripping at you with what?
-You're gonna think l'm batty.
-No.
Well, maybe...
Maybe it had hands covered with hair.
Or maybe it had paws, like a wolf.
Only it wasn't all wolf. l didn't get much chance to see.
Pity people can't get themselves killed and chewed up during the daytime.
Man my age needs his sleep.
Pretty bad lacerations, Clovey.
What's the matter? Wouldn't she kiss you?
Wasn't a kissing mood, Doc.
Yeah, men ain't as good as they used to be.
Gonna tell me about it? l don't know, Doc. l'm trying to decide.
Gonna make a medical report.
One man killed by an animal.
Another, darn near.
Besides, you want to marry Amy, you'd better tell me.
We're not sure it was an animal.
Clovey, grit your store teeth.
Give me a little more, Amy.
Grit your store teeth, and grit them good, 'cause this isn't going to feel good.
Ow! Doc! Suffering catfish.
There. Better hope this takes. l'm not even sure whether l have to give you the Pasteur treatment for rabies or not.
Neither am l.
Wrap it up, Amy.
Jack, what are you trying to do?
Scare us half to death?
What are you holding back? lt wasn't an animal that killed Joe.
The same goes for Clovey. lt was a man.
There were teeth marks of an animal on Joe's throat.
We both examined Joe.
Amy's a good nurse, Jack.
She knows what she sees. So do l.
She's right about the teeth marks.
Well that's the trouble, Doc. l think we both are.
What are you talking about?
Well, it had to be either animal or man. l wouldn't lay odds on that, Doc.
Man, what you're trying to say is just a lot of poppycock.
Storybook stuff.
The things kids get nightmares about. l know, l know. But a witness saw what looked like a man kill Joe, and Clovey here is stone sober.
You got answers for it? l haven't.
There is a word for what you're saying, Jack.
Yeah, l went to school, Amy.
Werewolf? lf you think l'm gonna put that in my medical report...
A murder's been committed.
You can make out your report any way you like, but it was murder. lt wasn't a man accidentally killed by an animal. lf this gets in the papers, they're gonna think we're all crazy up here.
Okay, Doc. Can l go now?
Yes, but don't use the arm too much.
-lf what you're saying is the truth...
-l will take up the search in the morning. l'm not letting anyone go looking through those woods at night. l don't know whether l should take a sedative so l can sleep or drink coffee to stay awake.
Well, you can get some sleep, hon.
The deputies from Larken will be here in about an hour.
They'll help me police the town and set up roadblocks.
Nothing's getting in or out of town without us knowing.
-l'll check with you in the morning.
-Thanks, Amy. Doc.
By the way, if you have any books on the subject, you might read up and tell us what we're looking for.
-Good night.
-Good night.
What a night this is going to be.
Dead man in the other room and a werewolf running around loose.
You know, Jack's got me believing that?
Amy, those old books of mine up in the attic...
There's a couple on mythology.
Long as we can't sleep, they should make some interesting reading.
No! l was dreaming! l know l was dreaming! lt could only be that some animal came by while l was asleep.
Oh, Lord in heaven!
Give us a break, Sheriff. l promised the boss l'd bring him back a deer. l'm sorry, men. Nobody's gonna do any hunting in those woods until l say so.
Anyone tries it, l'll slap the biggest fine on him l can.
-But why?
-Never mind why.
Just stay inside the town. lt's going to look awfully funny going back without any meat.
How do you like that?
The boys are sure raising Cain over not getting their hunting licenses.
Yeah, but they'll get over it.
You watch the store. l'm going down to check the roadblocks.
All right. l can't help it what papers you boys are from.
-All l know is the orders we got.
-Trouble?
Reporters from the city papers.
Reporters? What do you men want here?
You usually set up roadblocks because a man got killed by some animal?
-How did you men know about that?
-There's a talkative undertaker in Larken.
We saw the body.
Come on, Sheriff, let us through.
You have no right to hide the news.
Besides, that guy charged us seven bucks just to drive up the mountain.
-All right. Let them through.
-Okay, Jack.
-They go through!
-Thanks, Sheriff.
Say, do you know anything about what's happening up in Mountaincrest that we ought to know?
You think there's a story, you find it. lt's been quiet.
Car 1 7's out having a look along the roads.
Well, let me know pronto if they see anything. lf he tries to stray off the road dressed the way you say he is, he'll freeze to death up there. l'm counting on that. l'll check with you later.
What do you want?
Sorry. l didn't mean to frighten you. l saw the doctor's sign at the front of the door.
No one answered the ring.
My uncle's probably upstairs. ls someone ill?
Could l talk to him, please? lt's...
-lt's very important.
-Of course.
-Follow me in the back way. lt's shorter.
-Thank you.
Doc, someone to see you.
-This is Mister...
-Dr. Gilchrist.
-lf l can talk to you, please.
-Come in.
Amy always listens.
Sometimes she diagnoses better than l do.
-l didn't say l was sick.
-No?
She'd better listen, anyhow.
Take a seat, Mister... l don't know what my name is.
Well, that's a good beginning.
That's why l had to see you. l can't remember who l am, or even what l'm doing in this town.
You're a stranger here?
When did you arrive? l think last night.
Well, let's try and think back a bit, get a few facts.
What's the last thing you remember? l'm not sure. lt seems as if there was an automobile accident. Not a bad one.
-l was taken to a doctor's office.
-Who was the doctor?
There were two of them. l never saw them before.
That's all. That's all l can remember. l've been trying to remember more but there's nothing.
Doctor, l want to know who l am. l want to know what l am.
What you are?
Was there a man killed in this town last night?
Yes.
How?
The sheriff thinks it was some kind of animal.
No. l killed him.
Now, now, lad. You're just a little bit upset.
Those tracks l saw in the snow this morning, they had to be mine.
They couldn't have been anything but mine.
Doctor, in the name of heaven, what's happened to me?
Amy, maybe our friend would like a little something to quiet him down.
What makes you think you killed somebody?
A man pushed me into an alley last night.
Tried to take my money.
-l couldn't let him have it. lt was all l had.
-So?
He hit me and... l thought l was dreaming... l leaped at him and he fell and then l...
Here. You'd better take these.
They'll help you...
No!
You're not giving me anything.
-Those other doctors did something to me.
-Now, now, now, take it easy, lad.
We can't help you if you won't let us.
-Let's get a hold of Sheriff Haines.
-l saw the police on the road.
They had guns.
The man in the woods last night, he had a gun.
Josie? Quick, get me the sheriff's office.
Sheriff's office. Clovey speaking.
Oh, hello, Amy.
No, no, Jack isn't around.
He should be back in about a half-hour.
What?
Look, Amy, are you sure?
Well, after all, for such a thing like that to happen...
All l know is it has happened.
Doc Jonas and l will come down and wait.
We must talk to Jack.
-Well, maybe he thought that Doc would...
-What's this?
Well, the guy that killed Joe was in the Doc's office not more than 20 minutes ago.
You okay?
He got away. Bolted like a jackrabbit when l mentioned the police. lt wasn't the police he was afraid of, it was your guns. l want you to round up every man you can get.
We're going to search every inch of those woods.
-Oh, Jack, listen to me, please...
-Honey, there's no time. Go ahead.
-He's not a criminal. He's a sick man.
-Man? lt was nothing but a human being that came into our office, Jack. l didn't get a chance to examine him.
He remembers an automobile accident and his brain may have been injured.
He can't even remember his name or where he came from.
Jack, help him. Don't shoot him down.
He committed a murder, Amy.
What can l do? lf he wants to surrender, okay.
-But what if he doesn't?
-He was afraid of us, too.
He said some other doctor had done something to him.
-What?
-That, he didn't say. l've never seen a man so frightened in my life, Jack.
Give him a break, if you can.
-lf we could just talk to the other doctor.
-lt's no use.
He can't remember the doctor's name or even what town he was in. l found Mack outside.
He's going to line up some men for us.
Okay. Clovey.
-You run up against this guy in the woods?
-Yeah?
Doc and Amy think we should take him alive.
Well, that won't be easy.
You're the boss, Jack.
But if it means the necks of any of those men out there, they're gonna shoot.
We'll do the best we can.
Doctors try to save people.
The law doesn't always have a choice.
Morgan.
You think this is our man?
This paper says they found an animal's teeth marks on the dead man's throat.
Morgan, what have you done?
Done?
Accomplished is a better word, Emery.
Someday, it will happen.
The human race will destroy itself.
Not quickly but slowly.
That wolf-man is the proof.
Radiation creates mutants, people who become monsters, no longer human.
They'll make the hydrogen bomb more powerful, then more powerful again, enough to change every person on the face of the earth into a crawling, inhuman thing through fallout radiation.
You really believe it will happen in our lifetime?
The science of destruction always gains on us, Emery. lt could happen tomorrow, next day, next week. l don't know.
-But it won't happen to us.
-Well, how can you be sure? l wasn't until l read that newspaper.
The serum we used from that wolf-mutant that died of radiation, that was the answer.
By a slow series of inoculations, we can immunize ourselves and a small, select group, just as l planned.
When the rest of the world has been destroyed, we will be the only normal, thinking persons left.
The perfect science, Emery.
The one that ends all science.
Perhaps it would've been better not to know what's coming.
Ridiculous. lt will mean the beginning of a new kind of world.
A world that will start without hatred.
-And we'll be the ones to give it birth.
-How did we get into this, Morgan?
Two doctors, full of ideals and curiosity.
Too much curiosity?
A doctor should be able to cure more than broken bones and runny noses. l want to cure a world.
You see, l still have my idealism. You don't.
But to take a stranger, a man, injured in an accident and give him a full inoculation of that serum...
Yes, l'd almost forgotten about him.
So much could fail if he should remember and tell someone what he knows about us.
There's nothing else left but to...
Well, you're not going to kill him.
Do you think he still wants to live after what he's become? lt'll be an act of charity.
-There's somebody at the door.
-Another patient with a runny nose. l'll get rid of him and we'll drive to the town of Mountaincrest immediately. lt's less than 40 miles. lf the police haven't disposed of the man by the time we get there, it may become our task.
-Dr. Chambers?
-Yes? l'm Mrs. Duncan Marsh.
Oh, the man who was injured in the automobile accident. l haven't heard from him and the police said that you might know where he is.
The police?
Well, yes, they said he was injured near here, and they brought him in to you.
Well, that's right, but l wouldn't worry. lt was just a bump on the head.
As a matter of fact, l left him in my office for a moment, and when l came back, he was gone. l can only presume he doesn't think much of doctors.
-Was he all right?
-Of course, Mrs. Marsh.
Even his car was only slightly damaged.
He fell asleep at the wheel, ran into a tree, and hit his head on the steering wheel. l'm sure you'll be hearing from him shortly. l hope so. Usually when he travels like this he calls me every day.
A most considerate husband.
Well, thank you. l feel much better about it now.
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.
What'd the doctor say, Mom?
Did he know about Dad?
The doctor said he was fine.
Now what do you want to do?
-Go shopping? A movie, what?
-Would you mind, Mom? l'd rather go home.
Maybe Dad'll call up or something.
All right, we'll go home. Come on, scoot.
Five hours out here and no sign of anything.
Well, l hope the boys at Mile High Ridge are doing better than we are.
Hold it, men.
Sorry, men. You'll have to turn back. lt's urgent that we get to Mountaincrest, Officer.
We're doctors and may have information that will help the sheriff. lnformation?
We believe the man involved in that murder up here was a patient of ours.
All right. Check in at the sheriff's office when you get there.
-Wait here a minute, we'll open up.
-Thank you.
-You shouldn't have told him that.
-We'd never have got through otherwise.
-Apparently, they haven't caught Marsh yet.
-There's no time to lose.
We'll check in at one of the lodges and then tell the sheriff that we want to help.
What can we do that the deputies can't do?
We know one thing for sure that they don't.
They're looking for a man.
We're looking for an animal with an animal's instincts and habits. l doubt if they'll ever catch Duncan Marsh in the open. lf there's a hidden spot anywhere in the forest, an animal will find it.
Jack, it's going to be dark in about another hour. Think we ought to turn back?
No, we'll push on for another half mile or so. l hate to think of that thing loose for another night near the town.
Put out the fire, Red.
Over there, in that hilly section.
Go on, take a look up there.
Marsh!
You. You were with him.
You were with that other doctor.
Please. Help me, please.
Don't move, Marsh.
Don't come a step nearer.
There's nothing we can do for you.
You're going to shoot me? But why?
What have l ever done to you?
Morgan! Morgan! Morgan!
-Who told you to fire that shot?
-That creature up there.
-Why did you shoot at me?
-l'm Sheriff Haines.
We had that mine entrance located and we were closing in on it.
-You scared the thing away.
-Why didn't you shoot at it yourself?
From this distance and miss the way you did?
Morgan!
-Who's that?
-Dr. Forrest.
-Morgan, Morgan, l saw him, his face.
-What did you see?
One moment it was a human being talking to me, and then it changed.
His hair and his ears and his teeth.
Everything. lt would have killed me if it hadn't been for that shot.
Only authorized people of the searching party were supposed to be out here.
Let me explain, Sheriff. l'm Dr. Morgan Chambers.
Dr. Emery Forrest and l came to Mountaincrest this afternoon to offer our services.
For what?
The man you're looking for was a patient of ours.
A patient?
Jack, it's going to get dark before we get back.
Yeah. We'll set up sentry posts around the town for tonight.
All right.
You make an official report at my office.
Somebody will be around in a couple of hours with some more coffee.
-Just make sure you keep awake.
-Yeah, okay.
Jack, why do you suppose those two doctors really came here?
They could have phoned you the information.
Well, they claim they have a personal interest in our wolf-man.
Personal? They only treated him once.
Then they didn't even know his name.
Well, at least we know the car accident took place in Brockville.
The report from the police down there should be in soon.
What a horrible, horrible thing to happen to a human being.
Yeah, l know.
-lt happened again.
-What this time?
The thing killed a sheep at the Sanderson ranch, then it started to... lt started to eat it like a starving animal.
Laura Sanderson saw it.
She's in the office now, hysterical. l want all the farms in the area evacuated.
Call the people. Tell them to get into town as fast as possible. lf they haven't got phones, send trucks out for them.
All right.
You still think we should treat this thing like a sick man? l don't know, Jack. l just don't know. lf you'd only heard him plea for help the way l did.
You, Doc and l had better have a huddle, honey.
Why? l have something in mind that you and Doc won't like. lf you can say anything that'll make me see it differently, l'll forget it.
You want me to talk you out of it, Jack, and l'm not so sure l know how. l can only give you the same arguments l gave you before. lt's vicious and cruel.
How can you do that to another human being?
Amy, the lives of everyone in this town are dependent on the police right now.
Why don't you try to see it my way? lf this thing killed a sheep because it was hungry, it'll go for bait in a trap for the same reason.
A bear trap could crush its leg, too.
Maybe that'd be better than having to shoot him, Amy. A leg can be healed.
And if we can catch him, perhaps a sick mind can be healed, too. lf only that thing hadn't come to your office.
How can she defend it that way? l've seen you pick up an injured bear cub in the forest and care for it till it was well.
-That's not a strong enough argument.
-All right, then, Jack, do what you have to.
-Good night, Doc.
-Good night.
This makes eight traps we've set.
How many more we got to go, Jack?
Just these three.
That'll cover all the areas around the town.
Calling Car 22. Calling Car 22.
Hey, Jack. Your radio.
Calling Car 22. Come in, Jack.
Hold it, Clovey. Jack's coming.
Clovey?
Jack, things are popping here.
Can you come back?
Right away.
Help Fanning finish those last three traps.
-Okay.
-l'll send a car back for you. l told you, if there was any news to be had, you'd get it.
You've been telling us that for some time...
Hey, Sheriff, you gonna give us a story, or are you still making with the sign language?
What happened?
Well, number one, one of our cruisers found a car ditched off the road.
Where?
About halfway up the road leading into town.
The car is registered to a Duncan Marsh,
1670 Lane Drive, Cedar Corners.
Cedar Corners?
That's about 30 miles from Brockville, where those doctors are from.
Number two, a police report came in from Brockville.
-Duncan Marsh has a wife and son.
-Wife and son? lf this Marsh is a wolf-man, it ain't gonna be pretty.
His wife and kid are on their way up here now.
My guess is that Marsh is our guy.
His wife filed a missing persons report on him two days ago.
How do you explain a thing like this to a wife and kid?
Maybe you don't try.
Did you leave an okay for her to get through the roadblock?
Yeah. l don't want those newspaper men on her back. l guess the best thing would be if Doc and Amy'd take her in. l'll see if l can fix it up.
When she gets here, bring her over.
All right.
Mountaincrest.
We almost missed the turn-off.
-Mom?
-Yes, Chris?
How would Dad's car get all the way up here?
Well, he might have been up here on business.
Maybe something happened to the motor and he got stuck.
-lt'll be all right.
-He didn't even phone us or anything.
You're a worrier, honey.
Emery, that woman's in town.
The wife of Duncan Marsh.
The deputies took her to the house of a Dr. Gilchrist.
She doesn't know anything.
What could she tell them?
She can't tell them anything.
But her being in town means the deputies might try to take him alive, rather than killing him.
Every minute that he's alive is dangerous to us.
Morgan, can't we turn back?
We're not murderers.
We're both responsible for what Duncan Marsh has become.
When time comes to kill him, you'll be with me.
These are a little out-of-date, Chris.
Doc Jonas hasn't worn these in...
Well, let's say a long time.
Think they'll fit you?
-l don't know.
-Well, come on, hold up your foot.
Yeah, l think they'll do fine.
-You're being so good to us, Miss Standish.
-lt's nice having guests.
-Miss Standish?
-Yes?
Why is everybody being so vague about my husband? l can't seem to get straight answers from anyone. l'm sure if anyone could tell you anything, they would. l'm not a child, Miss Standish.
My husband's car is here, but he isn't. l read in the papers about a murder at Mountaincrest. ls it possible that the dead man could have been identified wrong?
No. l'm sure your husband's alive, Mrs. Marsh.
Why are you sure? l'm sorry, Chris.
You've been waiting all this time.
Here, try on the skates.
-Thank you.
-l'll see if the lake is frozen...
-Please, Miss Standish.
-Amy, Jack's in the office.
-You'd better see him.
-We'll talk later.
Amy, l just got the word.
Marsh was caught in one of the traps.
-Was caught?
-He got away. The trap was smashed.
-Then he's hurt.
-There were bloodstains in the snow.
Would you care to tell that to his wife and son?
Amy, cut it out.
Men who've had wives and kids have gone to the gas chamber. l'm sorry, Jack.
She was just questioning me and...
Well, how much longer can we keep the truth from her? l'm afraid not much longer. l couldn't help hearing.
-Where's Chris?
-He's still outside.
Sheriff, l appreciate your trying to protect me, but if you don't tell me the truth, l'll have to find out some other way.
Mrs. Marsh, your husband's ill.
He's killed a man. l don't believe it.
Duncan is the most gentle man who ever lived.
Well, something's happened to him.
Just what, we don't know.
-We won't know until we can examine him.
-The papers said something about a man...
You know how the papers are always looking for sensations.
We think we can find your husband, Mrs. Marsh.
He's been injured.
We may be able to bring him in and help him.
Amy, see if you can fix me up a kit.
Bandages, antiseptics, whatever's necessary.
You'll need a doctor with you.
You haven't been able to go through those mountains in winter for 20 years.
-l'll get my things.
-Now, wait a minute. l'm not letting you go out there. lt seems to me l've had better luck with Mr. Marsh than anyone else. lf he's... lf he's himself, there won't be any trouble.
Sheriff, l know Duncan won't give you any trouble if Chris and l are with you.
-l don't know what's right anymore.
-l think Mrs. Marsh is, Jack.
But what if her husband's...
Whatever my husband is, Sheriff Haines, l want to help him in every way l can.
Well, l'm taking a portable public address system with me, so l can talk to him from a distance. l don't want to scare him off again. l'm hoping that we can talk him into giving himself up.
Please, take Chris and me.
Amy, see if you can find some more warm clothes.
Mrs. Marsh and the boy are going with us.
No rifles.
We'll carry pistols under our coats, where he can't see them.
Yeah. l guess most animals are gun-shy after the first shot.
-Hello, Sheriff. Starting a new search?
-Leaving in a few minutes.
Dr. Forrest and l would like to help, if we may.
Thanks, but the less people along this time, the better it might be.
Going to try and take your man alive?
-lf it's possible.
-l see.
Well, l suppose it's the most humane thing at that.
-Can you stay in town a while longer?
-Why, of course, if you wish.
There are some things about this case that are still bothering me.
Maybe you can help clear them up.
-Well, good luck, Sheriff.
-Thanks.
Goodbye. l thought he told you all he knew.
Well, according to Marsh's wife, nothing was ever chalked up against Marsh until his car accident.
Dr. Chambers treated him.
Maybe it means something, maybe it doesn't. We'll find out.
Wait here.
Mom, let me go with them.
That track takes off to the east.
We'll circle around and pick up the trail on the other side of that low hill.
All right. l don't want his wife to see this.
You know, Jack, when this is over with, l'm gonna get drunk and stay that way for a whole week.
You're going to have company.
Duncan. Duncan Marsh.
Duncan Marsh.
If you can hear me, show yourself.
We want to help you.
Duncan Marsh.
We know you've been hurt.
We're here to help you.
Duncan, I know you're hurt.
Duncan, I know you're hurt. Come on down.
We'll keep going.
He couldn't get much further with an injured leg.
Jack, thanks for doing it this way.
Let's hope he's normal when we do find him. lf prayers help, he will be.
Duncan Marsh.
We're ready to help you.
-Show yourself.
-Wait a minute.
Duncan Marsh.
We know you're up there.
Show yourself.
No harm will come to you.
We want to help you.
Nothing.
Mr. Haines, maybe if l could talk to him through that, maybe if he could hear my voice...
Duncan.
Duncan, darling, this is Helen.
Please, listen.
Please, try to understand, Duncan.
We want you to come home.
We want everything to be right again.
These men have promised not to harm you.
Show us where you are, Duncan.
Please, darling.
Chris is here with me.
He wants you to come home, too.
We know you're hurt, darling.
But there's a nurse here
who's going to help you.
Chris? Chris!
Dad! Dad!
Dad!
For the love of Mike, what's the big idea?
What's the deal, coming way out here and not telling us?
Chris.
You didn't even call us. We just waited. l'm sorry, Helen, l'm sorry.
Dad, this is the sheriff.
He and Amy are gonna fix your leg.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Helen, Chris, go away, please.
Don't stay here. Please make them leave.
-Any minute something could happen.
-Dad, l want to be with you!
Mrs. Marsh, your husband needs plasma and l can't administer it while he's upset.
You'd better take Chris and wait below.
Chris, go with your mother. lt was the traps that got him, l tell you.
There's an art in setting them.
You know that.
Place them just right and then kind of figure if the wind'll take the smell of your bait the way you want it.
Yes, sir. Me and the sheriff and Fanning are real handy with a bear trap.
We caught that wolf-man right in the ankle, so he can't run much anymore, can he?
Shut up, Durgis, you talk too much.
Well, l was just... All right, all right, if that's the way you feel...
Excuse me, fellows, l'll go home.
You feel lousy about it, don't you? l was just over to the jail a little while ago.
Jack wanted me to make a statement.
Marsh's wife and kid are there.
Funny. You think maybe you've got all the troubles in the world, till something like this happens to somebody else. l think l need a straight shot. l've never seen anything like it.
Everybody's going crazy.
-All of them scared.
-Scared?
Of what? They're celebrating.
The wolf-man's captured. l think l know what they're scared of.
They're scared of what Marsh has become because it could happen to them. lt could happen to anyone.
You see, now they know it's possible.
Make that a double shot.
How long do we have to wait like this?
Patience, Emery.
Just a little more patience.
How long do you think he'll stay the way he is?
Oh, even he doesn't know that.
You saw the way he broke the bear trap.
What makes you think he couldn't break out of the cell the same way?
Look, l got enough troubles of my own with this report.
Duncan, isn't there anything l can say that will change your mind?
You think it's easy for me to send you and Chris away?
When l'm better, l'll come home.
Please, darling, do as l say. lf it should come back while you're still here, that's the way you'll always remember me. lt would never be any good, even if l did come home.
Please, leave now while l'm still all right.
Dad, l don't want to go!
Please, Chris, don't make it so tough for me.
Come back soon, darling.
We'll be waiting for you.
Come on, son, we have to leave. Come on. l'll send someone all the way home with you.
-The roads are pretty bad at night.
-Thank you.
We'll find out how Marsh got that way.
We'll find out and we'll find a way to cure him.
Go on, now. l'm going over to Doc's.
No matter what, don't leave this place alone for a minute tonight.
You two can spell each other. l'll check back later.
You'd better grab some sleep before you fall flat on your face. l'll take the first shift if you want.
You know, l'm beginning to forget what sleep was like myself.
You know what? lf anything happens in there, get a hold of us quick.
There's an art in setting them.
Oh, yes, there is.
All you... What's the matter?
What's the matter? Ain't nobody else wanna hear how we caught the wolf-man?
-Why don't you get lost?
-Get lost?
Nobody wants to hear about it.
We caught him.
Yeah, we caught him, all right.
Right in the ankle.
You see, Emery, patience is its own reward.
Go to the sheriff's office and find out what precautions are being taken to guard Marsh tonight.
-You're not going to do anything in the jail?
-Please, Emery, do as l ask.
Well, she and the boy are gone.
Gibbs is a good man.
-He'll drive them home, all right.
-We were talking, Jack.
Up until now, what's happened to Duncan Marsh is beyond all our known laws of science and medicine.
You know, this thing didn't come on him suddenly, of his own volition.
You're trying to say somebody did it to him?
Yes.
Well, if it's beyond anything men know, how could somebody do it? lt's a frightening thought that a single human being, out of all the millions and millions, could somehow have obtained that kind of knowledge.
We want to send samples of his blood to a laboratory for tests.
Well, that's up to Marsh.
But he'll do anything if it will help him.
We don't feel it much up here in a place like Mountaincrest, but the world's a place of change.
Recently, for the first time in history, men were able to manufacture diamonds, real diamonds.
For the first time, men are making new valves for the heart and machines that can take all of a man's blood out of his body and then put it back again, while he's still breathing.
Every day, science and medicine start up new roads.
And you think Duncan Marsh is one of these new roads.
The thing is, the man who did it to Marsh, what did he have in mind?
And what kind of a future is he dreaming up for everybody else?
You two are giving me the creeps.
Doc, right now l'm too tired to look up any of those new roads of yours.
Then why don't you sleep on the couch tonight, honey, instead of going all the way home?
With all you've given me to think about l'm not sure l could sleep anywhere.
Try it.
You are going to talk to Duncan about those blood tests in the morning?
Sure.
-Providing.
-Providing?
Hey, you're a welcome sight.
Well, you're not. My bed looked much better.
No change in Marsh. He's out cold.
The guy's exhausted. l hope he stays that way till the ambulance picks him up in the morning.
Yeah.
-l'll see you in a few hours.
-Right.
He's going to be fine for us, Emery.
Get my bag and hurry.
Meet me near the jail.
Hello there.
-Who're you?
-Do you know me?
Mister, do you think if l could see, l'd be standing here?
-l'll give you a hand.
-l gotta go the other way.
Oh, wait a minute.
Aren't you the one who almost caught the wolf-man in a bear trap? l got him right in the ankle.
That's me. l'm the guy.
And do you know something else?
He broke that trap wide open.
What do you think of that?
Yeah, l hear they've got the pieces down at the sheriff's office.
-Could you show them to me?
-Certainly. The sheriff's a pal of mine.
Come on.
Whack to the ear.
Go out and get my bag.
See what condition he's in.
He's asleep.
Marsh. Quiet, Marsh! Quiet!
-lt's a scream, l tell you!
-Out to the jail!
My God.
Snap out of it, man.
That thing is loose in the village.
-Fanning, round up all the men you can get.
-Did he break loose?
Yeah. We'll need torches.
Animals are afraid of fire.
Maybe we can scare it away from the village.
Jack, l'm in a fog. What gives?
Marsh has killed Chambers and Forrest.
We can't take him alive this time, Amy.
He's killed two more men.
You can take a look at them, Doc, but l don't think it'll do much good. Come on.
Hold it a minute.
-He came this way.
-Well, it'll be light in a little while.
-Then we'll get him.
-Yeah.
Wait a minute, Jack. l can see something.
Throw some torches up there.
Hold your fire!
We're going up there after him?
No, l don't think he'll turn back now.
He's scared. l don't want to take a chance on any of these men getting hurt.
We'll wait till it's light. Let's go back.
There he is.
He's headed for the highway above the bridge. Let's try to cut him off.
Hey! Block the bridge.
Pull the scraper across the bridge.
Don't shoot. You'll hit the driver.
Shoot in front of him. Try to stop him.
Get to the other end of the bridge!
All right. Get him.
You see that? He changed back again.
-Do you think he'll stay that way this time?
-Yeah, he'll stay.
Now he can go home.
THE WHITE REINDEER
A child is born to a fiery snow.
Grew a girl with hay shoes.
Like a young reindeer doe.
Didn't know at her father's home.
Didn't know at her father's home.
When she went to her bridegroom's house.
That she was born a witch.
An evil spirit in her stomach.
Sacrificed at the altar of Maddar Ahkka
Sacrificed at the altar of Maddar Ahkka
A white reindeer.
From there she ran as a mountain reindeer.
Until the moment was at hand.
A lightning impaled the white.
There lay the girl with the hay shoes.
The snowblanket as her cover and a pillow made of snow under her head.
Pirita ! Will you come with us ?
Look at that.
Go, reindeer!
Faster !
Faster !
A reindeer is fast, but a wolf is faster.
Got you.
Do you love me ?
Looks like a hunter of she-bears is coming.
We have a buyer.
You have a bird. Sell her to us.
We have a buyer.
You have a bird. Sell her to us.
- Are you serious ?
-Yes I am.
- You can't treat our daughter badly.
- I'll do my best.
- You can't treat our daughter badly.
- I'll do my best.
A great acknowledgement on behalf ofthe bride and the bridegroom.
To you who gave a present to this honorary table.
Heads together. Like frogs.
Hello to all the wedding guests.
And to the memory of the young couple.
There is no more booze.
The bread and the salt are eaten.
Go after the reindeer.
Aslak.
Aslak !
Pirita !
I'll leave this to you as a house reindeer.
It'll grow up to be a beautiful draft animal. Thank you.
Again you leave and who knows when you'll be back. I'll miss you.
Again you leave and who knows when you'll be back. I'll miss you.
The weeks'll go by fast.
Goodbye, my bird.
Come back soon !
Hello.
I knew you'd come.
What do you want ?
A love potion ?
What do you want ?
A love potion ?
That's what the young women, and the older ones too, want.
A man of the mountains.
Tsalkku-Nilla knows how to do it.
Herbs from beyond ten mountains, from the streams of ten creeks.
A little bit of death mold.
The testicles of ten deers.
The strenght of ten deers.
Tsalkku-Nilla is such a seer that he brings the lost reindeer back home too.
He brings the dead back from their graves too.
You must sacrifice to the great altar the first living thing that you encounter on your way home.
Than can no man resist you.
Yet this winter you...
Yet this winter you...
Continue.
Witch !
Witch !
You must sacrifice to the great altar the first living thing...
Living thing...
Pirita ! Catch !
I missed you.
The first living thing...
Good day.
- Where is Aslak ? I want to see him.
- Other there at the resting point.
- Where is Aslak ? I want to see him.
- Other there at the resting point.
- Aslak has a fine-looking woman.
- You bet.
Aslak left with Tauno to hunt reindeer.
Found fresh tracks from the mountain.
Stay here for the night, he may come back soon.
Then no man can resist you...
A wild reindeer.
Don't. It's white.
Let's catch it.
I can catch it.
You'll see.
You'll see.
- How'd it happen ?
- Something odd about this.
Niilo left to chase a wild white reindeer.
We found him dead at the Demon's valley.
- Where are you going ?
- Cut some lichen. Come with me.
Don't play with me.
Will I say Hi to Aslak for you ?
Let's do it.
It's certainly that white reindeer.
That's your local superstition.
A reindeer can't kill a man like that.
That's the second man found dead at the Demon's valley.
There were clearly reindeer tracks in the body and no other tracks.
Jouni est parti 3 sa poursuite.
Jouni est parti 3 sa poursuite.
It's no ordinary reindeer.
It's bewitched.
You won't make me believe that.
Witchcraft won't help if it gets in my sight.
You won't make me believe that.
Witchcraft won't help if it gets in my sight.
Bullets won't hurt it.
You need cold iron.
Bullets won't hurt it.
You need cold iron.
- You need to kill it with a spear.
- A spear you say ?
L'll rely on my rifle if that witch attacks me.
You shouldn't make fun of a witch.
It can become angry.
A lot happens here that you can't understand somewhere else.
A lot happens here that you can't understand somewhere else.
What's wrong with that dog ?
I'll show you how to kill a witch.
What is that ?
I shot it...
I shot it...
Something's happened.
Reindeer...
I shot it... Laughing...
I shot it... Laughing...
We paid 15000 for it.
Yes, I paid 15000.
It was nice.
It was nice.
After a week it dropped its horns.
Witch !
Witch !
Witch ! White reindeer !
Witch ! White reindeer !
Witch ! White reindeer !
Catch the witch !
Catch the reindeer !
I'll kill the Witch !
Let's go home.
What's wrong with you ?
What has happened to you ?
Are you ill?
Are you ill?
I'm afraid. You mustn't go after the white reindeer.
Promise me.
I don't want to lose you.
All right. I'm not going anywhere.
A shame that the little white reindeer got away.
Wonder if a wolf caught it on the mountain.
What are you looking at?
Is it wrong ifl look ?
Haven't seen you in a long time.
Go to bed now.
I'll have to go soon too.
Pirita !
I saw... a horrible dream.
- Did I scare you ?
- I'm afraid to sleep.
Look at the moon glare.
You have had a bad dream.
Sleep, my bird.
No ! Don't go !
No ! Don't go !
No ! Don't go !
No ! Don't go !
Don't go 5
It's the bewitched reindeer !
The white reindeer !
The white reindeer !
Why are you forging a spear?
You can only kill a witch with cold iron.
The white reindeer !
The white reindeer !
Tsalkku-Nilla !
Tsalkku !
The powerful spirit ofthe altar.
Take back the spell.
Release me from witchcracft.
Hear me ! Release me !
Release me ! Release me !
Criswell Predicts...
Greetings, my friend. We are all interested in the future, for that is where you and I are going to spend the rest of our lives.
And remember my friend, future events such as these will affect you in the future.
You are interested in the unknown, the mysterious, the unexplainable.
That is why you are here.
And now, for the first time, we are bringing to you the full story of what happened on that fateful day.
We are giving you all the evidence, based only on the secret testimonies of the miserable souls who survived this terrifying ordeal. The incidents, the places, my friend we cannot keep this a secret any longer.
Let us punish the guilty, let us reward the innocent. My friend, can your heart stand the shocking facts about grave robbers from outer space?
Plan 9 From Outer Space
All of us on this earth, know that there is a time to live, and that there is a time to die, yet death is always a shock to those left behind.
It is even more of a shock,when death, the proud brother, comes suddenly without warning.
Just at sundown, a small group, gathered in silent prayer around the newly-opened grave of the beloved wife of an elderly man.
Sundown of the day, yet also the sundown of the old man's heart, for the shadows of grief clouded his very reason.
The funeral over, the saddened group left the graveside.
It was when the gravediggers started their task that strange things began to take place.
Fifteen to four.
Yup, right on schedule. There's the ol' San Fernando Valley out there now.
-You better radio in for landing instructions, Danny.
-Right, Jeff.
Burbank Tower, this is American 
Flight 812, over.
Wouldn't surprise me any if  he's asleep this time of the morning.
American Flight 812, this is Burbank Tower.
If I were asleep you'd never get on the ground !
Your case maybe you'd be up there for good. Over.
You got me that time, Mac.
This American Flight 812 requesting -
Burbank Tower to American Flight 812, over.
Burbank Tower to American Flight 812, over.
Holy mackeral.
-Burbank Tower to American Flight 812, are you in trouble?
-Trouble ?
-Take a look for yourself.
-What in the world...
-That's nothing from this world.
Burbank Tower to American Flight 812, are you in trouble? Are you in trouble?
-Mayday, mayday. Stand by, Burbank Tower.
-Do you suppose the passengers saw it?
I doubt it. Most of them are asleep.
But it was quite a jolt, Jeff. I'll check.
Good. We'll get them ready for landing.
Keep it quiet until we get instructions.
-Right.
-American Flight 812 reporting to Burbank Tower, over.
-D'you hear anything ?
-I thought I did.
Don't like hearin' noises.
'Specially when there ain't s'posed to be any.
-Yeah, sorta spooky-like.
-Maybe we're getting' old.
-Whatever it is it's gone now.
-That's the best thing for us too. Gone.
-Yeah, let's go.
The grief of his wife's death became greater and greater agony.
The home they had so long shared together, became a tomb.
A sweet memory of her joyous living.
The sky to which she had once looked, was now only a covering for her dead body.
The ever-beautiful flowers she had planted with her own hand, became nothing more than the lost roses of her cheeks.
Confused by his great loss, the old man left that home, never to return again.
At the funeral of the old man, unknown to his mourners, his dead wife was watching.
-First his wife, then he.
-Tragic.
-Tell me something. Why was his wife buried in the ground, and he sealed in a crypt?
-Something to do with family tradition.
A superstition of some sort.
Well, it's getting' dark. We'd best be on our way.
Then, as two of his mourners left his final resting place.
Minutes later, the police, lead by Inspector Daniel Clay, arrived at the scene.
-Who found him ?
-The man and girl.
-Medical, uh, examiner been 'round yet?
-Just left.
The morgue wagon oughta be along most any time.
-You get their statement ?
Yeah, much as we could. They're pretty scared.
-Finding a mess like this oughta make anyone frightened.
Have one of the boys take the guy and the girl back to town. You take charge.
-Okay Inspector. What're you gonna do?
-Look around a little.
-Pretty dark out there.
Once you get beyond those lights you won't be able to see your hand in front of your face.
-I will get one of the flashlights from the patrol car.
-You be careful Clay.
-I'm a big boy now, Johnny.
Looks like a bobcat tore through them.
Yeah.
Say Lieutenant, d'you get that funny odour ?
-How could I miss it ?
Oh, that'll be the morgue wagon now.
-That's the fifth siren in the last hour.
-Oh, something's happened down at the cemetery. A lot of police cars and lights. 
I stopped but I didn't see anything.
Oh well, whatever it is, the morning paper will carry the whole story.
You seem to still be up there somewhere.
Maybe I am.
I don't think I've ever seen you in this mood before.
I guess it's because I've never been in this mood before.
Something about your flight ?
Yeah.
What happened, Jeff ?
-I saw a flying saucer.
-A saucer ?
You mean the kind from up there ?
-Yeah, or its counterpart.
 I was shaped like a huge cigar.
Dan [something] saw it too.
When it passed over, the whole compartment lighted up with a blinding glare. 
Then there was a tremendous wind that practically knocked us off our course.
-Well did you report it ?
-Yeah, radioed in immediately and they said well keep it quiet until you land.
Then as soon as we landed, big army brass grabbed us and made us swear to secrecy about the whole thing.
Oh, it burns me up. These things have been seen for years.
They're here, it's a fact.
And the public oughta know about it.
-There must be something more you can do about it.
Oh no there isn't.
Oh, but what's the point of making a fuss.
Last night I saw a flying object that couldn't possibly have been from this planet.
But I can't say a word. I'm muzzled by army brass!
I can't even admit I saw the thing!
Sounds like Clay's in trouble.
Bet that apparition we saw had something to do with it. 
Come on.
-Is he dead ?
-Yeah.
He's messed up as bad as those two back there.
S'pose that saucer or whatever it was had something to do with this?
Your guess is as good as mine, Larry.
But one thing's sure. Inspector Clay is dead... murdered...and somebody's responsible!
You're in charge now, Lieutenant.
-Yeah, guess I am. Kelton. 
-Yes Sir ?
Get back up to the car and get on the radio.
Tell the coroner he's gotta make another trip out here.
Well how 'bout the lab boys ?
Well who do you think we left back at the car, boy scouts ? Come on, Larry.
Greater love hath no man, than to lay down his life for another.
It is always difficult to have last words over the grave of a friend.
And Inspector Daniel Clay was a friend.
A dear friend to me and to all of us.
The bell has rung upon his great career.
Now we lay him to rest. A rest well deserved, but so premature.
People turning south from the freeway were startled when they saw flying saucers high over Hollywood Boulevard.
A woman, startled by the sight in the sky, telephones the police.
There comes a time in each man's life, when he can't even believe his own eyes.
Saucers seen over Hollywood!
Flying saucers seen over Washington D.C.
The army convoy moved into the field.
Rockets were quickly set up.
Colonel Tom Edwards, in charge of saucer field activities, was to make the greatest decision of his career.
He made that decision. Colonel Edwards gave the signal to fire.
Then as swiftly as they had come, they were gone.
Even to the piercing eye of radar and the speeding jet fighters.
-Quite a sight, wasn't it Sir.
-A sight I'd rather not be seeing.
-Are you worried about them Sir ?
Well, they must have a reason for their visits.
Visits? Well that would indicate visitors!
Are big guns the usual way of welcoming visitors?
We haven't always fired at them.
For a time we tried to contact them by radio, but no response.
Then they attacked a town. A small town, I'll admit.
But nevertheless a town of people. 
People who died.
-I never heard about that Sir.
Well, it was covered up by the higher echelon. Take any fire, any earthquake, any major disaster, then wonder.
Flying saucers, Captain, are still a rumour. 
Officially.
Looks like we beat them off again Sir.
What do they want...where are they from...where are they going...
They, Sir ? Who ?
Oh, this is a training manoeuver, Sir. 
We only did a little practice firing at the clouds.
Yeah. I wonder what their next move will be.
What will their next move be ?
Your space commander has returned from Earth.
Send him in.
You have your report ?
We had to pull in here to 
Space Station 7 for regeneration.
We're returning to the planet Earth immediately thereafter.
-What progress has been made ?
-We contacted government officials.
They refuse over existence.
What plan will you follow now ?
Plan 9. It's been absolutely impossible to work through these Earth creatures. 
Their soul is too controlled.
Plan 9...ah yes. Plan 9 deals with the resurrection of the dead.
Long-distance electrodes shot into the pinion pituitary glands of recent dead.
Have you attempted any of this plan as yet ?
-Yes Excellency.
How successful has it been ?
We have risen two so far.
We shall be just as successful on more.
The living...they have no suspicion of your movements ?
We had to dispose of one policeman.
However, none of those risen have been seen. 
At least, not by anyone who still remains alive.
It's too bad it must be handled this way. However it must.
Those who take from the grave will lead the way for our other operations.
Yes, Excellency.
-Continue on. Report to me in two Earth days.
I feared His Excellency wouldn't take our report this well.
Well had he been dealing with our own people his reaction would have been completely different.
He understands the difficulties of the Earth race.
What do you think will be the next obstacle the Earth people will put in our way?
Well, as long as they can think we'll have our problems.
But those whom we're using cannot think. They are the dead.
Brought to a simulated life by our electrode guns.
You know, it's an interesting think when you consider...the Earth people, who can think, are so frightened by those who cannot: the dead.
Well our ship should be regenerated. We better get started.
I still think you oughta go in town and stay with your mother until I get back.
This is our home and nothing's going to take me from it.
Besides, most men try and keep their wives from going home to Momma. 
-That's not the point.
-That's all the point there's going to be.
Now toddle off and fly your flying machine, Darling.
But if you see any more flying saucers, will you tell them to pick another house to buzz?
Don't worry about me.
Oh you're the only thing I do worry about. Oh forget about the flying saucers.
They're up there. But there's something in that cemetery, and that's too close for comfort.
The saucers are up there. And the cemetery's out there.
But I'll be locked up in there. Now off to your wild blue yonders.
You promise you'll lock the doors immediately ?
I promise. Besides, I'll be in bed before half an hour is gone, with your pillow beside me.
-My pillow ?
Well, I have to have something to keep me company while you're away.
Sometimes in the night when it does get a little lonely,
I reach over and touch it, then it doesn't seem so lonely anymore. 
A crazy kid.
I do love you, Darlin'.
See you Thursday.
-Goodbye, Honey.
You know I'm not leaving here until you're locked safely inside.
All right, Darling.
If you're especially nice I may even lock the side door.
And be sure you keep the yard lights on.
You're mighty silent this trip, Jeff.
You haven't spoken ten words since takeoff. 
I guess I'm preoccupied, Danny.
We've got thirty-three passengers back there that have time to be preoccupied. 
Flying this flybird doesn't give you that opportunity. 
I guess you're right, Danny.
-Paula ?
-Yeah.
-There's nothing wrong between you two ?
-Oh no, nothing like that.
Just that I'm worried, she being there alone and those strange things flying over the house and those incidents in the graveyard the past few days. It's just got me worried.
Well, I haven't figured out those crazy skybirds yet but I give you fifty to one odds the police have figured out that cemetery thing by now.
-I hope so.
-If you're really that worried Jeff why don't you radio in and find out?
Mac should be on duty at the field by now. 
He could call Paula and relay the message to you. 
-Hi Edith.
-Hi Silents. I haven't heard a word from this end of the plane since we left the field.
Jeff's been giving me and himself a study in silence.
-You boys are feudin'?
-Oh no Edie, nothing like that.
Hey Edie, how about you and me balling [bawling?] it up in Albuquerque ?
Albuquerque ? Have you read that flight schedule Boy ?
-What about it ?
We land in Albuquerque at 4 am. That's strictly a nine o'clock town.
Well I know a friend that'll help us --
-Let's have a problem first, huh Danny. [?]
-Ah he's worried about Paula.
I read about that cemetery business.
I tried to get you kids to not buy too near one of those things.
He thought it'd be quiet and peaceful there.
No doubt about that.
It's quiet alright, like a tomb.
I'm sorry Jeff, that was a bad joke.
Say., I almost forgot what I came in here for.
How's the coffee situation?
-Mmmm that's for me.
-That sure wouldn't hurt anything, Edie.
Okay, I'll be right back. And say Jeff, make that call to your wife. 
Huh, not only will she throw water on my Albuquerque plan but now she's repeating herself.
-How 'bout that Albuquerque ball ?
-I can't resist your charm, Danny Boy.
Residents near the cemetery paid little attention to the blast of thunder and the flash of lightning. 
But from the blast, arose the moving figure of the dead old man. 
Hello ? Who ?
Mac ? Well, hi Mac !
Sure I'm all right.
I just fell asleep.
Tell Jeff I'm all right.
Okay Mac. Thanks for calling. Goodnight.
Mrs. Trent ! Mrs. Trent ! What's wrong ?
They'll be at the hatch in a moment.
You can open it now, Tanna.
Turn off the electrodes quickly.
They can't tell us from anyone else.
It's tough to find something when you don't know what you're looking for.
-I don't think the Lieutenant does either.
-Then what're doing out here? I was off duty an hour ago.
Ah don't ask me any questions. I'm just a hardhand [hat? head?] just like you.
What do you suppose that noise was?
Whatever it was it's no more strange than the other things happening around this cemetery.
Spirits like Old Farmer Caulder talked about.
-Heh. Maybe.
-The only spirits he saw tonight were those I smelled on his breath.
Well don't forget Mrs. Trent claims to have seen them too.
She didn't have anything on her breath.
-She was hysterical.
-Well true, she was frightened, and in a state of shock.
But, don't forget that torn nightgown and the scratched feet.
Yeah I hadn't thought of that.
I guess that's why you're a detective lieutenant and I'm still a uniformed cop. 
Sometimes it's only the breaks, Larry. In the meantime let's get-
-Lieutenant, Lieutenant ! Did you hear that ?
-How could we help it ?
-It sure was strange.
-Know what it was ?
-No more than you do.
-If it weren't for orders I'd get out of here right now.
-It was a saucer.
-A flying saucer ? What makes you say that ?
You remember the noise we heard the other night ?
We were knocked to the ground, how could I forget ?
Exactly, but you're not remembering that sound.
There you're wrong, Lieutenant.
I'm with a fact the sound is similar, but what about the blinding light?
Well haven't you heard ?
Many times a saucer hasn't had a glow, or a light of any kind for that matter.
-That proves it. What next Lietenant ?
Maybe this doesn't mean much, but uh Jamie and me found a grave that looks like it's been busting into.
-What ? Where ?
-Why uh why...
-Come on man out with it, we haven't got all day to waste.
-Uh, just over there beyond the crypt.
-All right, show us the way !
Look, here it is Lieutenant.
Ah it's been broken into all right.
Strange. If someone had broken in, the dirt should be piled up here somewhere. 
It looks like it's fallen in into the grave.
-Larry you'll be out of that uniform before you know it.
-Do we have the right to look down there Lieutenant ?
-Ah, technically no.
Well, this spot looks familiar, though.
We shouldn't investigate any further without the permission of  next of kin.
Let's go get it !
-How ?
-I see what you mean, the gravestone's down there.
Well, let's go down and find out who's grave it is.
-How ?
-By going down and finding out !
-Are you sure you mean that Lieutenant ?
-If I didn't mean it I wouldn't have said it.
-Scared ?
-Well, why do I always get hooked up with these spook details?
Monsters, graves, bodies,... oooh all right.
Casket's here, but nobody's in it.
Can you read the name on the casket?
It's too dark. Give me a flashlight.
-How 'bout a match ?
-We sure could try it. Let me have them !
It's Inspector Clay's grave !
Be he ain't in it!
But meanwhile, in the Pentagon, in Washington DC...
Try G2...
...come in !
Yes of course, I'll keep in touch.
Come in, Colonel Edwards. Close the door. At ease, Colonel.
-Thank you, Sir.
-Sit down.
I understand, Colonel, you've been on tap for many of our saucer attacks.
I'm in charge of field operations, Sir.
You believe there are such things as flying saucers, Colonel ?
-Yessir.
-You've seen them ?
Yessir.
You realize there's a government directive stating that there is no such thing as a flying saucer?
Yessir.
Do you stand by your statement that you've seen flying saucers ?
Well, uh... yessir.
This could mean a court marshall. Admitting this against direct orders.
General Roberts, may I speak freely ?
-You may.
How could I hope to hold down my command if I didn't believe in what I saw and shot at? 
-I, uh, like you Colonel.
-Thank you, Sir.
There are flying saucers.
There's no doubt they are in our skies.
They've been there for some time. 
What're we going to do about them ?
-Who knows ?
-Then, uh, they really are there ?
-I thought you were convinced of that !
-I am.
We've had contact with them.
-Contact ? How ?
-Radio.
-They speak our language ?
-Well not quite.
We  received messages from their space ships.
For a while it came in as just a lot of jumbled noise.
And now, Sir ?
Well since they first uh tried contact with us by radio, we've developed a language computer. 
A machine that breaks down any language to our own. 
General, uh,  what's this all got to do with me?
Well you've been in charge of saucer field activity for a long while.
I think it's about time you heard these recordings. Do you mind?
Mind ? Huh, I'm anxious !
This is Eros, a space soldier from a planet of your galaxy.
I fully realize our language differences, however I also know you finally have perfected the dictorobitary, or as you on Earth put it, the language computer. So you can now understand that which I speak.
Since the beginning of your time, we have been far beyond your planet.
It has taken you centuries to even grasp what we developed eons of your years ago.
Do you still believe it impossible we exist?
You didn't actually think you were the only inhabited planet in the universe?
How can any race be so stupid ?
Permit me to set your mind at ease.
We do not want to conquer your planet. Only save it.
We could have destroyed it long ago, if that had been our aim.
Our principal purpose is friendly.
I admit, we have had to take certain means which you might refer to as criminal, but that is because of your big guns which have destroyed some of our representatives.
If you persist in denying us our landings, then we must only accept that you do not want us on friendly terms.
We then have no alternative but to destroy you before you destroy us.
With your ancient, juvenile minds, you have developed explosives too fast for your minds to conceive what you were doing.
You are on the verge of destroying the entire universe.
We are part of that universe.
This is our last -
That's the end of that one.
Atmospheric conditions in outer space often interfere with transmitting.
How many of these recordings do you have General ?
An even dozen up to now. This was the last one.
We received it over a month ago.
-Do you think they mean business ?
-We can't afford to take any chances.
Come over here. You ever been to Hollywood ?
-Oh a couple of times. A few years ago.
-You're going to be there in the morning.
Just a few minutes from Hollywood, in the town of San Fernando, reports have come in of saucers flying so low the exhaust  knocked people to the ground.
There have even been stated claims of saucer landings.
Major Carlson will replace you while you're out there.
You're the best man for the job of attempting to contact them.
Find them, Colonel. See what in hell it is they want!
All right, Sir.
These are confidential reports, Colonel.
Read them over carefully on the plane, turn them over to intelligence when you get to Los Angeles.
They'll have further orders for disposition.
Yessir.
-Colonel Edwards ?
-Yessir ?
-Good luck.
-Thank you, Sir.
We are ready to report, Excellency.
-You are many days late.
-It was unavoidable.
We tried to transmit via televisor, but atmospheric conditions made transmission impossible.
-You should have transmitted as soon as conditions permitted.
-I thought time was of the essence.
Suspicion  has fallen upon our movements.
Our ships have been viewed near the point of operations.
And what has this extra time gained, Eros?
We have successfully risen three of the dead ones.
-Permit me to see one.
-Bring in the big one.
Use your small electrode gun.
I have taken two ships from your command.
But...that will leave only my ship !
It is necessary that you continue your mission alone.
I have need of your other ships elsewhere.
Even though you have risen three of the Earth dead, the plan is far from successful, and you Eros, must prove it an operational success before more time, energy, and ships, may be spent on it.
We will not fail. Everything is on our side.
Not everything ! 
You do not have the live Earth people !
You report that your ship was viewed at scene of your present operations ?
That is correct.
They have been viewed many times, but not at the scene of operations.
Something must be done about that.
Stop him Tanna ! He's close enough ! Turn off your electrode gun !
No ! No ! Stop him Tanna !
I can't get it, it's jammed !
-Stop him you fool !
Drop the gun to the floor, Tanna !
The metal will break contact!
[Gasping] That was too close !
Yes.
Bring the giant here that I may get a better look at him. 
Yes, he's a fine specimen.
Are they all this powerful on planet Earth ?
This one is an exception, Excellency.
-What are the other two like ?
-One is a woman, the other an old man.
-An old man, you say ?
-Yes, Excellency.
This gives me a plan. Put the big one away.
Pick up your electrode gun.
Make sure it's in working order before pointing it at him.
Whatever made it jam must have been cleared by the fall.
Take him back to the ship.
The old one must be sacrificed. Re-land on Earth.
Send the old one to enter a dwelling.
Then cut off the electrokinetic and turn on your ship's decomposure ray.
The result will astound those watching. Astound them enough to delay their attention until you have gained your other recruits from the cemetery.
Yes, Excellency. It'll be done.
Report to me when this has been accomplished.
Eros, the Earth people are getting to that which we fear.
Since they will not listen or respect our existence, they cannot help but believe our powers when they see their own dead walking 'round again, brought about by our advancement in such things. As soon as you have enough of the dead recruits, march them on the capitals of the Earth, let nothing stand in your way. Their own dead will be used to make them accept our existence, and believe in that fact.
Mr. and Mrs. Trent...this is Colonel Edwards from Washington DC.
-Good evening, Colonel.
-Hello Colonel. 
Colonel would like to ask you a few questions.
-Questions ? What about, Colonel ?
-May I, uh, sit down ?
Oh, I'm sorry, please do.
I want to ask you about your strange experience the other night, when you saw the flying saucer.
After that the police brought me home.
I hope I never see such a sight again.
Well after your description I don't think I'd want to see it either.
One thing more...after you were forced to the ground by that blast of wind, was it a hot or cold blast?
-It's kind of hard to explain.
It wasn't hot, wasn't cold, it was just a terrific force. We-we couldn't get off the ground. 
The light blinded me so badly I couldn't see a thing.
We could only feel the pressure of the wind, until it was gone.
When the glare left us, we could see a glowing ball disappearing off in the distance.
-Which way ?
-Toward the cemetery.
This is the most fantastic story I've ever heard.
And every word of it's true, too.
That's the fantastic part of it.
We found a lot of suspicious things out in that cemetery.
Then again, didn't find anything to base a fact or suspicion on.
Hey, do you hear anything.
You see anything out there Kelton ?
Too dark, Lieutenant.
But something's started stinking awful bad.
There's something out there.
-What do you make of that ?
-You got me ! It didn't look that way a minute ago.
-What about your man ?
-Oh, in the excitement I forgot all about Kelton.
Oh, he'll be all right in a few minutes.
-Did you see that thing ? Did you get it ?
-We got it.
What was it ? It didn't fall...I fired every bullet I had.
So did I. I don't know what it was or what happened, but unless that bag of bones can reassemble itself, it's out of the running now.
Colonel I've been out here so often you'd think I'd taken a lease on this place.
Not a long lease, I hope.
I see what you mean. But you know, I can't help but feel the answer's out here somewhere.
Is the uh girl safe ?
Mrs. Trent you'd better stay with the car.
-Stay here alone? Not on your life.
-Modern women...
-Yeah, they been that way all down through the ages.
Especially in a spot like this.
-Kelton ! -Yessir ?
-Stay with Mrs. Trent.
All right, Lieutenant.
-Now you stay close to the officer, Honey.
-I'd feel safer with you.
-Now the Lieutenant knows best.
-Oh I don't like it, but I guess there isn't much I can do about it.
-You have a gun ?
-No.
Know how to use one ?
After four years in the Marine Corps ?
-Here.
-You think we'll need these ?
You can never tell. Let's get going.
-What do you expect to find out here ?
-Well there's only one answer to that Mr. Trent, we'll know when we find it. Inspector Clay's grave is right over here.
-Is that the one you told me was broken into ?
-Yes.
-This it ?
-Yeah.
Looks to me like someone had broken out instead of in.
-I figured that, but that's impossible ! -I wonder.
-Look, Colonel, some things just can't happen.
Yeah well after that apparition that was draped across Mr. Trent's patio, I would say we should keep our minds open to anything. 
Look, Colonel, I'm a policeman. I've got to deal in facts.
But, I guess I'll have to go along with you.  You know I bet my badge right now we haven't seen the last of those weirdies.
-They'll discover our ship soon.
-You going to let them find us ?
It's the only way. These are the same men who have been so close so often.
They must be halted before they can inform others about us.
-But there were others in the car !
-They'll be taken too.
Send the big one to get the girl and the policeman. I'll turn on the dictorobitary so we may converse with them.
You know, maybe we're barking up the wrong tree.
One thing a policeman learns, Mr. Trent, is patience.
-Where the burn spot you mentioned.
-Right over the - look!
We'll investigate, but move carefully.
A moment or two more, and you will be the first live Earth people ever to enter a celestial ship.
Wow...boy,  how could anything that big hide for so long a time ?
Never heard metal sound like that before.
-What do you see ?
-Only my reflection. Must be some kind of one-way glass.
-How do you get into this thing ?
-I'm not sure I want to find out.
They're just outside.
You can open the outer hatch now.
-You goin' in that thing ?
-That's what we're here for.
-I don't know, the way these things speed around we might just get in there and pft! Off it goes.
-That's a chance we take.
Well, I took a chance on those earlier airplanes. Might just as well see what the inside of one of these looks like. Got your guns ready ?
-I tell you one thing, if a little green man jumps out at me I'm shooting first and asking questions later.
They're in the outer chamber now.
Eros, do we have to kill them ?
-Yes.
-It seems such a waste.
Well wouldn't it be better to kill a few now than, with their meddling, permit them  to destroy the entire universe ?
-You're always right, Eros.
-Of course.
But those are not my words, those are the words of the Ruler.
Now you two stay right where you're at.
We will do as you command. For the moment.
-No for the moment about it. You just do as I tell you.
You do not need guns.
-Maybe we think we do.
They would be of no use to you now. 
-They've been mighty useful before on flesh and blood, and you two look like you've got a lot of both.
True, they would be effective upon us. If you were to have the opportunity to use them...
Mister, if you don't get away from that control board I'll show you just how effective they can be.
Shall we talk now, or wait ? Your friends will be here shortly.
-What friends ?
-Those you left at the vehicle.
-If you've done anything to Paula...
-Take it easy Mr. Trent.
Oh I assure you, no harm has come to her. Would you like to see?
Next time you try that I won't aim at the board.
-You're a headstrong young man.
I was only going to turn on the televisor so you could see her movements. 
Go ahead, my friend, but move very carefully. 
She's only fainted.
-You fiend !
-I ? A fiend ? ...
I am a soldier of our planet !
I ? A fiend ? We did not come here as enemies.
We came only with friendly intentions. To talk.
To ask your aid.
-Our aid ?
-Yes.
Your aid for the whole universe. But your governments of Earth refused even to accept our existence.
Even though you've seen us, heard our messages, you still refused to accept us.
Why is it so important that you want to contact the governments of our Earth ?
Because of death. Because all you of Earth are idiots !
-Now you just hold on, Buster.
-No you hold on. 
First was your firecracker, a harmless explosive. Then your handgrenade.
They began to kill your own people a few at a time. Then the bomb, then a larger bomb.
Many people are killed at one time. Then your scientists stumbled upon the atom bomb. Split the atom.
Then the hydrogen bomb, where you actually explode the air itself.
Now you [audio jump] brings the destruction of the entire universe, served by our sun.
The only explosion left is the solaronite.
-Why there's no such thing.
-Perhaps to you.
But we've known it for centuries. Your scientists will stumble upon it as they have all the others.
But the juvenile minds you possess will not comprehend its strength, until it's too late.
You're way above our heads.
The solaronite is a way to explode the actual particles of sunlight.
Why that's impossible.
Even now, your scientists are working on a way to harness the sun's rays.
The rays of sunlight are minute particles.
Is it so far from your imagination they cannot do as I have suggested? 
Why a particle of sunlight can't even be seen or measured.
Can you see or measure an atom ? Yet you can explode one.
A ray of sunlight is made up many atoms.
So what if we do developed this solaronite bomb ? We'd be even a stronger nation than now. 
Stronger. You see ? You see ? Your stupid minds...stupid ! Stupid !!
-That's all I'm taking from you !
-Get back here you jerk !
Let him finish.
It's because of men like you that all must be destroyed.
Headstrong, violent ! No use of the mind God gave you.
You talk of God ?
You also think it impossible that we, too, might think of God ?
You,  who wear the uniform of your country. You see, I wear the uniform of my country.
Yes, we've had to use drastic means to get to you, but you left us no alternative.
When you have the solaronite, you have nothing. Nor, does the universe.
You speak of solaronite, but just what is it ?
Take a can of your gasoline. Say this can of gasoline is the sun.
Now you spread a thin a line of it to a ball, representing the Earth.
Now, the gasoline represents the sunlight, the sun particles.
Here we saturate the ball with the gasoline, the sunlight.
Then we put a flame to the ball. The flame will speedily travel around the Earth, back along the line of gasoline to can, or the sun itself. It will explode this source, and spread to every place that gasoline, or sunlight, touches.
Explode the sunlight here, Gentlemen, and you explode the universe.
Explode the sunlight here, and a chain reaction will occur, direct to the sun itself.
And to all the planets that sunlight touches.
To every planet in the universe. This why you must be stopped.
This is why any means must be used to stop you.
In a friendly manner, or as it seems, you want it.
-He's mad.
-Mad ? Is it mad that you destroy other people to save yourselves ?
You have done this.
Is it mad that one country must destroy another to save themselves ?
You have also done this. How then is it mad that one planet must destroy another that threatens the very existence-
-That's enough !!
In my land, women are for advancing the race, not for fighting man's battles. Life is not so expansive on my planet.
We don't cling to it like you do. Our entire aim is for the development of our planet.
-What happened to you ?
-How come you're all alone ?
I asked for lots of help !
-You sounded drunk or something on the radio.
-If I didn't see it with my own eyes I would never have believed it !
-Believed what ?
It was horrible ! And he almost broke my shoulder !
Look, what are you trying to say ? If you don't make sense we'll never get to the bottom of this. Now who slugged you ?
Inspector Clay.
-What ?
-It was Clay all right, only not like we remembered him.
Well his grave was busted into, wasn't it ?
Next you'll tell me you saw skeletons.
-We did, earlier.
-Now I know you're off your rocker.
All of us saw, the Lieutenant, the Colonel, everybody!
-Where's the Lieutenant now ?
-We've gotta find them.
Mrs. Trent is gone! I was left here to guard her. Then Clay showed up and put me out of the running.
And the second time tonight and I'm getting darned tired of it !
-Which way were they going ?
-Oh, that way.
Come on !
Then one day it could all be gone, in one big puff of smoke and ball of fire. All that out there, the stars, the planets, all just an empty void.
You two had better come along with us.
-Come with you ? Where ?
-The police station.
So it seems you think you have the upper hand.
Look out there. 
Jeff.
She is unharmed, but he would kill in seconds if I so choose.
Holy cow!
Look there.
It's Clay all right, there's no mistaking that.
-And he's got Mrs. Trent !
-Get your gun ready.
-From all I've seen tonight guns won't do any good.
Clay is dead, and we buried him. How are we going to kill somebody that's already dead ?
Dead ! And yet there he stands ! That other one earlier I emptied a full clip into him.
I'm seeing it, that's the only reason I'm listening to you.
Look, I've got an idea. Hurt him or not, we've got to try something.
I'm going to sneak up behind him and whop him over the head. That oughta make him move.
Follow me. Even when Clay was alive he couldn't run fast enough to catch me, so when he does, you grab Mrs. Trent and run like lightning in the opposite direction.
-Oh, you think it will work ?
-Know anything else to try ?
Oh, I'll be all right. Take care of the others.
Your men have felled the big one.
This could only happen because the electrode ray is off.
He'll walk again when I turn it on.
Hold it, right there.
-Suppose the Lieutenant and the others are in that thing !
-Well suppose there are martians or something in there !
Come on, let's go.
Open up in there, open up !
-Get that door open.
-Colonel I wouldn't know one switch from another.
Hold on Eros, I'll have the ship in the air in a minute !
Get out of here, Jeff ! The ship's on fire !
Eros !
Eros everything's on fire ! Hurry, wake up Eros ! Eros, Eros, wake up, wake up !
Eros! Eros wake up, Eros! God wake up!
Oh, I wonder if that's the last we'll see of them ?
Perhaps, but sooner or later there'll be other.
Look !
Have they caught that woman, that thing yet ?
Hey that's right, there's another ghoul running loose.
And it's my guess that she'll look like him.
With the ship and the ray gun gone, they have no control.
We got to hand it to them though, they're far ahead from us.
Fire ! Eros ! Aaaaaaaaah !
My friend, you have seen this incident based on sworn testimony.
Can you prove that it didn't happen ?
Perhaps on your way home, you will pass someone in the dark, and you will never know it, for they will be from outer space.
Many scientists believe that another world is watching us this moment.
We once laughed at the horseless carriage, the aeroplane, the telephone, the electric light, vitamins, radio, and even television !
And now some of us laugh at outer space.
God help us... in the future.
Subtitles by FredFal
From her beginnings on a Navy drawing board... through the months of secret field experiments out on the Western desert... then through the desperate search for new metals with properties she needed... she was designed to be man's greatest weapon of the seas... the atom-powered submarine.
Her engines were to be a miracle of speed and power... her sides strong enough to withstand any blow... her armament and firepower of greater force... than the worst enemy she might encounter.
The mind of man had thought of everything... except that which was beyond his comprehension.
- All right, Griff, I'll take over.
- Good morning, Captain. Had breakfast?
Yep. Orange juice, bacon, eggs, coffee.
- How we doing?
- I can't get used to this thing.
Just like an automatic elevator.
Speed: 18. Steady on course.
Quite a bit of difference between this and the old-fashioned iron lung, huh?
Roomy? My gosh, this conning tower is just like a ballroom.
Take it easy, Griff.
It's still a submarine.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- How about the men?
They should complain?
All they do is eat and sleep, press a button when there's work to be done.
How about you, Captain?
Satisfied?
Down scope.
Why shouldn't I be satisfied?
Three world records in the bag on our first shakedown cruise?
Listen to that music.
All we need is some champagne and dancing girls.
Shall I have the chief change the record?
Yeah, you'd better, before we start chasing mermaids.
MacAninch, something a little more salty, if you please.
Salty, sir?
Yeah, let's get off this Hawaiian kick.
It's even demoralizing the captain.
Aye, aye, sir.
Eight.
Pair of fives.
Pair of tens.
- What's going on?
- Yeah, what?
¿Que pasa?
I dig that.
There's another beep from the sonar epuipment, sir.
Target bearing 1-8-0.
Range: 1-5-0-0.
There's nothing back there.
Sonar still picks it up,
Captain.
Bearing.
It's dead astern.
Submerged about as deep as we are.
Looks like it could be following us.
Whales sometimes get playful out here in the Pacific.
Scans bigger than a whale.
- Another sub?
- Even bigger than a sub.
It's closing in on us, Captain.
You'd better take a look at this.
Conning Tower to Control.
Left 20 degrees rudder.
New course: 3-0-0.
Left 20 degrees rudder.
New course:3-0-0.
The rudder is 20 degrees left, sir.
What would you call that?
Probably a short circuit in our sonar system showing up as an echo.
- Check it.
- I just did, Captain.
It's working all right.
Shall I check it again, sir?
Never mind.
It's really gaining on us, whatever it is.
- Getting closer, huh?
- As close as 500 yards.
Conning Tower to Maneuvering.
All ahead flank.
All ahead flank, sir.
Give those atoms a poke.
Give me everything you've got.
Aye, aye, sir.
Are we losing it?
No, sir. He just gained another 200 on us.
Give me a sonar image. I want to see what this thing looks like.
Griff, man battle stations.
Man battle stations!
Man battle stations.!
Man battle stations.!
Go to Control and take the conn.
I want a zigzag course and the usual escape pattern.
Aye, aye, sir.
Now let's see what you got here.
What do you call that?
It's no whale, sir, that's for sure.
It's no ship either.
Let me check that wiring again.
Keep me informed.
Come left 3-5-0.
Left 3-5-0.
Sonar checks okay, Captain.
Bearing: 1-2-0.
Range: 5-0-0.
Can't seem to lose it, Captain.
Range: 4-0-0.
What happens when it catches up with us?
When you're in command of $55 million worth of submarine, you don't gamble.
Range: 3-0-0.
- Stand by to take her deep.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Range: 2-0-0.
- Take her deep.
- Full dive on the bow plane.
Full dive, sir.
- Ten degrees down bubble.
- Ten degrees down bubble.
- All planes are at full dive, sir.
- Very well.
Resume course.
Steer 3-3-0.
3-3-0, sir.
It's too close to get a range now, sir.
Conning Tower to Maneuvering.
All stop.
We're getting a radiation warning signal. Where's it coming from?
Not from our reactor, sir.
It must be.
Recheck your reactor.
Reactor shield okay.
Engine's okay.
Nothing hot in here, sir.
- What happened to us?
- I don't know.
- All you men okay?
- Okay.
But let's find out where that radiation is coming from before we all fry.
It's coming from outside the ship.
Look!
- I don't figure it.
- I can't either, sir.
Haven't got time to try now.
Our sonar system's out. Fix it.
Maneuvering, let's pull out of here!
All ahead full!
All ahead full, sir.!
But we're standing still!
That's not the engine's fault, sir.
Keep pouring it on.
You okay, Griff?
Okay here, sir.
Surface!
Still no luck.
We're fouled tight.
Hand me that thing.
I want two Apua-Lung volunteers to blast the sluice.
Get in your gear and stand by the escape hatch. Take a demolition charge.
- I'll take over.
- Aye, aye, Captain.
Anybody hurt?
Mac took an awful crack in the head here, Captain.
- How do you feel?
- All right.
What's a fractured skull, anyway?
Is that damn thing still going?
Not afraid of a little radiation, are you?
I've heard it makes you so you can't have children, sir.
Mac was married just before we left port, Captain.
- Congratulations, Mac.
- Thanks. We're counting on a family.
We won't hang around down here any longer than we can help it.
Volunteers are ready, sir.
Hand me that thing.
I'm gonna rig in the bow diving plane to see if that will free us. If it won't...
Just cross your fingers.
Rig in bow diving planes.
Aye, aye, sir.
That's doing it.
Full rise on the stern planes.
Aye!
We're loose, Captain!
Speeïs increasing.
We're coming up, sir.
- That's a relief.
- Stand by to surface.
Stand by to surface.
Aye, sir.
What's on your mind?
Stern planes are fouled.
Show signs of radioactivity.
- Tell those swimmers to stay clear?
- I did, sir.
What'd you find?
A chunk of stuff caught in the stern diving plane, sir.
- What kind of stuff?
- Rubberlike, Captain.
What'd it look like?
We didn't get too close because of what the exec said about radioactivity.
- Looked like a fish to me.
- It was more like a barrel.
- A barrel?
- Yes, sir.
I believe it's stuck there till we get into dry dock.
She's jammed solid, sir.
All right, you men go below and get yourselves some coffee.
What's your guess, Griff?
I was just gonna ask you, sir.
Privately?
Privately, I'm keeping my mouth shut and I'm advising you to do the same.
The next time I cruise in these waters
I'll have armed torpedoes on board.
How about officially?
Officially?
Shakedown cruise completed, X-ray.
Struck submerged object, X-ray.
Damage minor.
Putting into Pearl for repairs.
Have it coded and passed on to Operations.
Aye, aye, sir.
And just hope that's the end of it.
And just hope that's the end of it.
But that was only the beginning.
When Commander Mathews brought the atomic submarine into Pearl Harbor... the Defense Department found itself confronted with a problem... beyond the scope of Navy manuals.
What was the nature of that nameless substance... found caught in the damaged diving planes?
A substance so strange, so inexplicable and alarming... that the best minds in the nation had to be called upon to solve the problem.
Behind the guarded door where the secret lay hidden... and for the first time in their lives... three people met.
Couldn't be a mistake.
You think so, Professor?
It's tissue, all right.
- Where'd it come from?
- Some living creature.
All that hunk came from one living creature?
That's right.
You mean, that's not all one animal?
There's more to it?
A great deal more.
It'd be dead now, wouldn't it?
I doubt it.
Must be pretty big.
Enormous.
Doctor, what kind of a sea beast would be that large?
What do you call it so I can stop calling it "it"?
I have no idea.
Nor have I.
Well, how do we find out?
That will take time and research.
I'll wire the university right away to get a leave of absence.
The Navy will take care of that.
How about you, Professor?
Working with Dr. Carter is every marine biologist's dream... but my school needs me.
You can get along without me,
I'm sure.
Can we, Doctor?
No.
Forgive my ignorance, Doctor, but what makes her so unipue?
ProfessorJoyce is head of Marine Biology... at the Southeastern Institute of Oceanography.
I'd say she's probably the outstanding authority on marine biology... with the possible exception of Vanderhume himself.
Then we'll get him.
Before you start looking,
I may as well tell you...
Vanderhume is dead.
Oh.
ProfessorJoyce.
Yes?
I have to ask you to stick around.
Why, Commander?
Because the... the Navy would appreciate it.
I'm sure the Navy's able to get along without me.
Dr. Carter seems to think otherwise.
Dr. Carter's perfectly able to speak for himself.
I'm speaking for him.
I'm expected at a board of regents meeting on Tuesday.
It's about the appropriations for our coming academic year.
Are those appropriations that important?
To my school, very much so.
You know, this thing that may be running loose in the Pacific... that could be important too.
- I'm sure of it.
- Perhaps not in the way you think.
I'm a scientist, Commander.
I don't have to be reminded that your objectives are not necessarily my own.
Our objectives have nothing to do with the situation.
The Navy will see you're not penalized for your absence from the institute.
Arrangements will be made.
Well, I feel like I'm being drafted.
You are.
It was still too early for the world to know what was going on... behind that closed door.
Only a handful of men in high places heard reports of progress made... and waited impatiently for the final conclusion.
Mathews speaking.
Oh, yes, Admiral.
Hold on a minute, sir.
They're still making tests, sir.
There's nothing conclusive to tell you.
I'll call you the minute anything happens.
Yes, sir.
Good night, sir.
During 12 days and nights nothing was certain.
You people work hard.
- It's our job.
- I didn't realize how hard.
- Are you trying to apologize?
- In a way.
- It's not necessary.
- I think it is.
Let me explain something to you.
A, I have been privileged to classify an unknown sea specimen.
B, I have the honor of working with the greatJohn Carter of Harvard... the inventor of analytical biology.
And C, my mind just isn't attuned to discuss things on your level, Commander.
I don't think you're being entirely fair, Miss Joyce.
Look, I have been working for almost two weeks now... without a decent night's sleep.
I'm tired!
I read your book on marine biology... and your plankton theory in tracing surface currents.
Strictly in the line of duty, of course.
I'm sorry, Commander.
Well, I'll forgive you if you call me Pete.
All right, Pete. But you have to let me get back to my work.
Why don't you take a break.
I have a reason.
- The Navy always has a reason.
- That's right.
All right, maybe you're right.
Tell me.
He's a pretty nice guy, isn't he?
He's wonderful.
- You're pretty fond of him, aren't you?
- Fond?
Why, he's magnificent.
He's a brilliant scientist.
His technipues are creative.
What are you driving at?
Oh, I just thought
I'd clear the atmosphere.
Oh. You mean romance.
Now you tell me something,
Commander.
Pete.
All right. Pete.
When you're driving that atomic submarine of yours... do you have much time for romance?
Even if I did admit I had the time, where would I find the opportunity?
Women aren't allowed aboard a submarine.
Poor boy.
I thought the Navy was epuipped for every emergency.
For the record, are you tied up?
I see what you mean.
Does that mean you're not?
A girl has to have some secrets, doesn't she?
Do you have the results of the iodide solution?
What?
What's the matter, Leslie?
Don't you feel well?
Well, I don't know.
I guess it's just lack of sleep.
You'd better get some rest.
I'll be all right.
Here are your results.
On the evening of the 13th day...
Dr. LeslieJoyce was taking the results ofher last test.
John, I think you'd better take a look at this.
What's going on?
- There's no doubt about it now.
- No doubt about what?
Thanks to ProfessorJoyce, we've discovered the nature of your monster.
What a gal.
Naval Intelligence.
Admiral Burns, please.
Well, Admiral, it's happened.
Carter and Joyce have got news for you.
Yes, sir.
Very well, sir.
I'll tell them.
An assistant secretary of the Navy,
Mr. Robert David Chase... is coming out here.
Adm. Norman, commander-in-chief of the entire Pacific area, wants in on it too.
He'll see us first thing in the morning.
Here, gentlemen, is your villain.
It'd take an enormous number of those to disable a Navy submarine.
Or just one of enormous size,
Mr. Chase.
There's a spuid on exhibit in the
American Muzeum of Natural History... just under 100 feet in length.
It came from the waters off the coast of Maine.
Our navy has never encountered one of those marine monsters before.
- How do you account for that?
- They only live at extreme depths.
They almost never come up unless they're disturbed.
Disturbed? By what?
Hydrogen bombs.
H-bombs have been blamed for every freak accident that's happened... since, up to and including marine monsters being disturbed.
Not disturbed, Mr. Chase.
Hungry.
Six days ago we gave this fellow here a radioactive meal.
Not a fatal dose, however.
Now, here is what he likes best... his regular diet of small fish.
Now watch.
Ordinarily cephalopods are not timid about catching a good meal.
This fellow seems to be having difficulty, however.
Why? We checked our answer with Professor Imoto in Tokyo.
He concurs.
Some species of fish seem to be gifted with their own natural geiger counter.
So the giant fish's dinner knows when it's coming and swims away?
In that case, he'd starve to death very puickly.
Unless he finds some other creature to live on.
What creature, for instance?
Some higher form of life.
Animals, possibly.
Or even man.
Gentlemen, let's put together a hypothesis from what we know.
In this area lie the Marshall Islands... where the H-bomb experiments took place.
Wind and north epuatorial current account for a drift of radioactivity... in this direction... contaminating marine life on the way.
Here lies the great Mindanao Deep... a chasm in the floor of the ocean so vast it has never been explored.
This is where our monster must have lived until recently... when he became radioactive... and began to warn his natural prey out of the surrounding waters.
He had to find other food or die.
Forced to rise to the surface... he hunted along theJapanese current.
There is evidence that he was swept in this direction.
What evidence?
Well, you may have read it yourself in the papers.
A month ago part of a Japanese fishing fleet disappeared in these waters... without a trace.
Siberian seal fishing has been reported unaccountably bad.
But theJapanese fishermen may have gone down in a typhoon.
Who knows what's really happening in Siberia?
Cmdr. Mathews' submarine encountered it.
Or are you puestioning that as well?
I have to puestion all of it.
Perhaps ProfessorJoyce has another opinion to advance.
No, I'm afraid not.
We've had too little sleep in the last few days.
- If you want to discuss anything else...
- That won't be necessary. Thank you.
You've given us enough to think of.
Before you go, do you mind giving us your reaction to our findings?
That'll be taken under advisement.
It's been very enlightening.
- Thank you for all you've done.
- Good night.
Good night, sir.
- Well, that's letting us down easy.
- Oh, you're just tired.
So what?
So I'm tired.
They didn't even believe us.
Well, they have to be cautious.
Of course.
We understand.
Does that mean we're free to go now?
Just as soon as your release comes through, in just a few days.
John, you can make the science congress.
If you play your cards right,
I can meet you in Cairo.
I was never very much good at playing cards.
- I'm tired. I'm going to the hotel now.
- We can all go over together.
All right.
I'll just change.
She's a wonderful girl.
Sure is.
- And you are a lucky man.
- Lucky?
Don't we make our own luck,
Commander?
Well, it isn't everyone that can vacation in Egypt.
Vacation?
No, Leslie and I have published contrary viewpoints... on the sinking nature of the coast of the Red Sea.
We're going to investigate via Apua-Lung.
The loser is going to publish a retraction.
Sounds ideal.
Nothing like mixing pleasure with work, huh?
Work?
Oh, yes, that is your work, isn't it?
Well, I'm ready.
Fine.
Well, good night.
He's an interesting man.
Isn't he?
Stand by to abandon ship!
4-0 minutes, 13 seconds west.
I'm repeating our position.
Nice of him to throw this going-away party for us.
Probably comes off of his expense account.
You sound bitter.
Well, if he's giving us a going-away party, why isn't he here?
Probably at a meeting of some kind.
What's the trouble, Leslie?
Oh, I don't know.
Just let-down, nervous.
As nervous as a bride left waiting at the altar.
- Don't be a fool.
- On the contrary.
I've been a sober professor so long, I'm entitled to one night of foolishness.
May I have this dance?
Do you consider that part of your foolishness?
Good evening.
I have your transportation passes and releases signed, sealed and delivered.
You'll be leaving in the morning.
Believe me, in the Navy that takes some doing.
- Thanks, Pete. You've been swell.
- He's probably glad to get rid of us.
I'm glad you didn't wait.
I'll have the same.
If the waiter comes by, would you order me a T-bone, rare, and some red wine?
- Where are you going?
- We, my dear doctor, are going to dance.
- With your permission, sir.
- Live it up, children.
- But you haven't even asked me.
- That's the way we do it in the Navy.
- But I haven't even had my dinner.
- Would you order another T-bone?
I don't like T-bones.
You're being a fool.
Don't believe her.
She says that to all the boys.
You're both being fools. Just because you're men, you think that...
Do you like lobster?
- Yes.
- Broiled with garlic butter and parsley.
Yes.
- Got it?
- Got it.
It's so balmy here.
Is it always like this?
Yes.
Don't you miss the rain?
No.
I like the winter... and the snow.
Snow's cold.
I'm taking an awful chance.
What do you mean?
You're going to accuse me of being a man.
Oh, my, I haven't eaten that well in years.
I guess your appetite kind of depends on your state of mind. Don't you think?
I've been thinking about a lot of things.
- About your trip tomorrow, for instance.
- Isn't it wonderful?
You're still leaving?
Of course she's leaving.
Why shouldn't she?
- I thought...
- I'm sorry.
What's going on here?
It was just something I said, and Pete misunderstood.
I am sorry, Pete.
Do you mind if I make a mental comment upon the nature of women?
Excuse me.
Pete, please, I...
Well, hello.
What am I gonna do?
Perhaps I could help you if you'd brief me on the background.
He kissed me.
Did you enjoy it?
Yes.
That seems like a normal reaction.
- He didn't even ask me.
- That's hardly relevant.
But I don't know him... who he is, what he's like.
Doesn't seem to have the same reservations about you.
In any case, tomorrow we'll be on a plane... and I'm puite convinced that, clinically speaking... no irreparable damage has been done.
- You know Prof. Joyce and Dr. Carter.
- Of course I do. Please be seated.
Thank you.
Admiral Norman's compliments.
And will you please come to his office first thing in the morning?
He asked me to apologize for rescinding your release.
Rescinding it?
A tramp steamer Honolulu-bound from Vancouver has been lost at sea.
It's considered possible that there may be some connection... between this incident and our problem.
We'll know more definitely if we find any survivors.
The area is being searched now.
Life raft. Men in it.
I'll set her down and bring them in.
Over and out.
Tell Admiral Norman the Polar Empress survivors are checking in.
You boys had a rough time, from what I hear.
Take a deep breath.
I have to check you over.
What happened?
It grabbed us, that's all.
What do you mean, it grabbed you?
Something came up out of the water, grabbed our ship and pulled it under.
Another breath.
You kidding me?
Why would I be kidding you?
Something came up out of the water.
Something like what, for instance?
Something like...
Well, like those.
Only big.
The biggest you ever saw.
Ain't I right?
They'll tell you.
And another one came up at us and grabbed the ship.
And another one... a whole lot of them... and they dragged it under.
Just like I told you.
I keep seeing those things coming up at us.
Been drinking?
What do you find to drink on a life raft outside of water?
- A blow on the head, anything like that?
- I'm all right!
Don't you believe me about... about those?
Of course I believe you about those.
Why shouldn't I?
I want you to go along with this fellow.
He's going to take you down the hall.
There's a man there with a white smock just like mine.
I want you to tell him all about... those.
See that he gets to Doc.
All right, you're next.
How about you?
Having any trouble with things like this?
Who's this Doc character?
He's one of the staff.
I ain't seen anything like that.
You can tell Doc for us we ain't seen nothin'.
I know he's lying as well as you do, but I have to account to Washington.
Am I justified spending half a million dollars searching the Pacific... on the strength of these lies?
Burns speaking.
Thank you.
That's the infirmary.
Doc says the patient's as bad as any of these boys.
He's recanted his original story, and now he won't say anything else.
Can he be released?
I think it's my turn now.
Tell them to let him go.
But not till after I get there.
Send in Hall, please.
- And don't come back unless I call you.
- Yes, ma'am.
Got a match?
Yeah, sure.
Let me light it for you.
- Care for one yourself?
- Sure would.
Maybe you can tell me where I can find Doc.
Doc?
He's through there, down the hall.
- What do you want him for?
- Well, that's kind of personal.
Besides, I don't think you'd believe me even if I told you.
I'd believe anything you told me.
Sit down.
Over here.
Well, it's kind of funny, but...
I saw the strangest thing.
- All I can say is, stay away from Doc.
- Why?
He'll make out you're sick in the head.
That's ridiculous.
Why should he do that?
No kidding.
That's what he thinks I am.
Have you been seeing things?
Me? Seeing things?
Don't be silly.
Well, sort of.
Tell me what.
I'm not telling nobody. You want me to get bounced back to Doc again?
What sort of things did you see?
I asked you first.
Okay. But if you say I said this,
I'll say I didn't.
You won't believe this... but something happened to a ship I was on.
She went down with all hands, except me and a few others.
I saw it happen myself.
Know what did it?
It was a giant octopus.
Well?
I guess it's up to you now, Admiral.
Take whatever steps are necessary.
In the weeks which followed, the North
Pacific was closed to all shipping.
The sea trade between three continents came to a standstill.
No nation in the world failed to demand, through its government and press... the reason for such drastic steps.
It was officially announced that the US
Navy was engaged in secret maneuvers... while in reality... the strangest search in history was taking place.
- Any news from the fleet?
- So far they've found nothing, sir.
That's from the State Department, sir, and they want an immediate reply.
Let's say we do find your beast.
What will you do to it then? That's the next point for us to consider.
Torpedoes if it's on the surface.
Depth charges if it's below.
- If you miss your first shot?
- We'll get it with the second.
It may not wait for you.
The Navy is not entirely incapable of speed, ProfessorJoyce. We'll chase it.
I think you underestimate him,
Admiral.
The body of a large cephalopod is like a giant sack... which he can fill with sea water and empty suddenly when he's alarmed.
Let me show you, Admiral.
Now watch.
Even the best of your ships are comparatively old-fashioned... compared to the cephalopod.
He's jet-propelled.
We'll have to destroy him with the first shot.
The State Department wants to know how soon we plan to raise our blockade.
Australia, Canada and Peru are protesting to the UN... unless we do it at once.
Why don't we tell them the whole story?
Washington makes those decisions, not us.
This stays top secret until the thing is definitely sighted... and confined to a limited area.
- How much longer will that take?
- It shoulïve happened by now.
When you start a job like this again, where do you begin?
With Naval Intelligence,
I should think.
If you mean me, I'm afraid I can't give you a very hopeful send-off.
My department has sifted all the information made available to us... during the last ten days... and this is what it boils down to.
One: three bathers missing from Australian beaches.
Sharks, probably.
Anything else?
Unusually high waves breaking on Midway.
Possible marine disturbance.
That's worthwhile investigating.
It is being at this time.
I'll have the reports within three hours.
Marine weather station off the Canadian coast is out of radio contact with land.
Anything more?
Deep-sea fishermen along the northwestern US coast... are complaining because of the poor fishing there.
That's all.
Any one of these may well be the clue we're seeking.
I suggest we take the one most likely... the weather ship out of touch with land.
Can you fly me there?
Admiral Burns will have a flight ready for you and accompany you.
- Thank you.
- Yes, sir.
Good luck.
May I take the next most likely... the unlucky fishermen in the Northwest?
- Is that even worth considering?
- I think so.
I can be ready in ten minutes if you'll have a plane for me.
- I'll see to it.
- Thank you.
Sir, my exec is aboard the submarine.
He's perfectly capable of relieving me.
I can't spare you to go hunting needles in a haystack... particularly a haystack
3,000 miles in expanse.
You'll have to stand by, Mathews.
That haystack may be a lot smaller than we thought, Mathews.
- Be on the flight deck in 20 minutes.
- Yes, sir.
Well, there she is.
How'd the car get turned over?
Well, the way we see it, they must have parked the car up the beach a bit... there where it's steep.
Brakes worked loose... rolled down, hit this soft sand... and over she went.
The ignition's still turned on.
Don't that beat it all.
Nobody ever noticed that.
Any reports since then of whales or sea serpents?
You mean she wasn't kidding?
She wasn't kidding.
What would you say made those marks, Officer?
Why, the beach was covered with those marks a couple days ago.
Commander Mathews to Sheriff's Station. Over.
Sheriffs Station.
Go ahead, Commander. Over.
Relay this message to the 12th Naval District.
Have them notify
Dr. John Carter...
You got that? Carter... that he's wanted here at once.
This has top priority.
Over and out.
- Where are they?
- Oh, fishing.
Seems they can't get enough fishing, them two.
- How's their luck?
- Not good at all.
Say, you mean to tell me the Navy sent you down here in a jet... just so you could go fishing?
That's about it.
- Hadn't you better tell them I'm here?
- Yeah, sure.
Oh, by the way, where's that imprint you were telling me about?
Down there behind those rocks.
- Thanks.
- Yeah, sure.
Hey, folks!
It's John.
I'd better get my robe.
Any sign of that whale?
- Still kidding, huh, Commander?
- This is no kidding.
Yeah, I know.
Flying saucers?
No, something that came from the sea.
Please be careful.
Look, Dr. Joyce, don't give me that sea serpent business, huh?
Just be careful and keep a sharp lookout. Understand?
Yeah.
Sea serpent.
Saves a lot of argument.
Well, Doctor?
As Leslie probably told you... it's the imprint of a giant octopoda bidranchiata.
Did you get photographs?
Yes. I sent them to Admiral Norman.
I hope he can believe his eyes.
Something convinced him. He's setting up headpuarters in San Francisco right now.
Deputy tells me fishing is rather poor here.
- Haven't had a single bite in 12 hours.
- Every sign is positive.
It definitely has been here, and it probably hasn't gone away.
Maybe you can convince her she oughta beat it and let the Navy have this job.
Beat it?
What does she say?
What's the difference?
Look, Pete, you don't see many women in the seagoing Navy.
- Are you kidding?
- Oh, shoreside women, sure.
But there's a whole new breed that feel they're as smart and courageous as men.
And they are.
They don't like to be overprotected or have their initiative taken away.
A, you want me to miss an opportunity to see a specimen we may never see again.
B, you're making up my mind for me.
And C, I not only don't like being pushed around... but you underestimate my ability to help in a crisis.
My sympathies are entirely on her side.
Didn't take long to lose that argument.
News of that incident on the Oregon coast reached throughout the world.
By order of the Defense Department... shipping took refuge in the harbors and all beach areas were closed.
The coastal waters of the Pacific were mined.
From Panama to the Arctic Circle... the Western coast of America made ready.
I've been asked what the Navy is doing in this emergency.
Inasmuch as operational headpuarters are now set up here in San Francisco... we will use this area as an example.
Offshore minefields, together with radar and sonar warning devices... set up on Golden Gate Bridge... should be more than adepuate to keep the monster out of the Bay Area.
A submarine net has been hung from Golden Gate Bridge itself... completely blocking the only entrance from the sea.
Now, this is primarily a warning device... but it's also capable of taking a charge of thousands of volts of electricity... which we've been advised will repel any form of marine life, if not kill it.
Is there anything
I haven't touched on?
You say the monster could attack us in coastal waters... and that it's dangerous to human life.
What's being done to attack it?
ProfessorJoyce will tell you.
Our first problem, of course, is to locate the monster again.
We're trying to do that now.
Operations toJohn Carter.
Have you seen anything yet?
Over.
Nothing.
It's slow out here.
Over.
Prof. Carter, this is Lt. Adams.
Where are you? Over.
Patrolling coastal waters.
Over.
What if you don't find anything?
Over.
We'll find something. We've baited the surface out here with dead shark.
The beast will come up to eat.
We've got several hundred planes watching for it in relay.
We'll find it, all right.
Over.
What'll you do when that happens?
Bomb it from the air? Over.
No, we've decided not to.
We have reason to think its destruction must be complete and instantaneous.
We risk complete failure with a near miss, or if we merely wound it.
The monster has only one vulnerable spot, one fatal target... its brain.
We're going to try to take advantage of that in a certain way.
Put ProfessorJoyce back on.
Over.
Go ahead, John Carter.
Over.
Leslie, take the newsmen down to the San Francisco Navy Yard... and show them the weapon.
That's all for now.
Stand by, Operations. Over and out.
Looks like any other torpedo, doesn't it? But it's not.
This has no propeller.
It's jet-propelled.
The Navy doesn't know what to make of it.
Perhaps you'll explain where you got the idea.
I spent all day yesterday at the Seamen's Institute... talking to retired whaling men.
This is the result.
A warhead patterned after a harpoon is encased in the nose.
Instead of exploding on contact, it's designed to penetrate... and remain fixed in the monster's flesh.
By means of spreading barbs.
And what's going to destroy the thing?
The explosive is sufficient to do that.
The difference is that in this case... we set it off electronically... once we're certain it's dead on its target.
Attention on deck!
Another thing: The men want to know if they can go on liberty.
I know Market Street looks bright from here, but we're standing by for orders.
Nobody leaves the yard.
Carry on!
Attention on deck!
I see they picked an atom sub to fight this thing.
Why is that, Commander?
Could be because of her new electronic epuipment or her speed.
- Was she ordered from Hawaii for that?
- That's right.
You think it's as bad as that?
- I think we're lucky she's here.
- Very lucky.
We have records of a monster like this one that appeared in the 13th century.
It ravaged the coastal towns of Denmark and Holland.
But they didn't have our modern weapons.
It was in those waters for over 30 years.
Here's another piece of evidence.
A monster was disturbed by volcanic eruptions on the floor of the ocean.
It happened in the same year as the Vesuvius disasters.
Gentlemen, that's all we have to tell you.
We're certainly obliged.
Thank you, Commander.
We gave you a break, now you give us one.
It all depends on you how the public takes this news.
We want them to have all the facts... but we don't want a panic on our hands.
Any last puestions?
Just one. Where did you say the monster came from?
From the Mindanao Deep, in the Pacific.
- Are there any more from down there?
- Probably.
- How many?
- I don't know.
- What do we do about them?
- I don't know that, either.
If you don't, then who does?
Thank you.
I was just wondering, that's all.
The 12th Naval District alerted the entire San Francisco area.
They were waiting and watching for some sign... of the approach of the monster.
Electric minefield. Contact.
Operations wants a check. Radar.
Sonar.
Radar. Sonar.
Still blank.
Let's get a cup of coffee.
Come on.

Red alert for Operation Sea Beast.
Get traffic off the Golden Gate Bridge.
This is Billings, and there's contact.
Contact with our net.
Give me instructions.
Over to you, Operations.
All right, Billings.
Let's see what the high voltage can do.
Close your switch.
GetJohn Carter for me, please.
It's not going to be me, after all.
I might as well be at the bridge.
Go ahead.
Wait a minute.
I'm going to go with you.
Hello, John.
It struck.
- Where?
- Golden Gate Bridge.
I thought we had this figured out.
What happened?
I can't tell you.
Instead of being driven off, it attacked.
Maybe it wants to fight.
Operations to all Navy personnel on the Golden Gate Bridge.
You can do nothing more there.
You're to abandon your posts and not sacrifice your lives needlessly.
- These are Captain Stacey's orders.
- Aye, aye, sir!
What's going on out there?
I threw the voltage into her, and up she came.
- Is it still on?
- Yes, sir.
- Where are you going?
- On the bridge.
- What for?
- To pull the switch.
No, you're not.
Do you wanna get killed?
Everyone has to be cleared by Captain Stacey, Carter orJoyce.
All right, clear me.
I'm Carter.
- Okay.
- Okay, Chief.
Hold onto her!
John, this way!
And a good evening, friends.
This is Sam Hayes.
I've got news for you.
As you probably know, our city has suffered disaster.
A marine monster is at large, perhaps even inside the Bay Area.
The federal authorities are doing everything to locate it... and, together with the city government, are taking every step proper... and possible to end this danger.
You are advised by the officials in charge... to remain in your homes.
This beast is dangerously radioactive.
Do not cause confusion.
Go about your ordinary pursuits.
Police officers will advise you if you must move to another place.
It will take some time before the road congestion along the peninsula... can be cleared.
Do not take these roads.
The Oakland Bay Bridge also is blocked, according to incoming reports.
The ferry boats are not running, so stay away from the Ferry Building.
I repeat, the ferry boats are not running.
This would put it approximately here.
Have they cleared that area?
- Not yet.
- They must.
They have a tentative position for it... in the bay near the Ferry Building.
This confirms it.
We want total and immediate evacuation... of the Embarcadero and Ferry Building area... by the order of the commandant,
12th Naval District.
Get those cars out of the foot of Market Street. Everybody back.
Go west on Market Street.
This area is in danger.
Everybody leave.
This area is in danger.
Everybody leave.
Look out!
My submarine is ready at Hunter's Point.
I have the authority to order a submarine captain.
Go ahead. You're commissioned to take any steps that seem proper.
- Aye, aye, sir. Coming, John?
- Absolutely.
We'll get in touch with you as soon as we get aboard.
Alert the Alameda area.
Station the maneuver at once.
On the double, Griff.
Take in two. Take in three.
Take in the brow.
I believe it's lifting itself out of the water.
What do we do about that?
Get me Leslie.
Com 12, this is Sea Beast. Over.
This is Com 12. Over.
Leslie, I would like to find something that would drive it back underwater.
How about heat? Over.
- I don't know. We can try.
- Hold it.
Ask Captain Stacey to contact the Army for flamethrowers. Over.
He's doing it.
Tubes forward. Stand by.
Tubes ready forward, sir.
How can you torpedo it from here with all those ships in the way?
This is a submarine. If it can go underwater, it can go under ships.
This is a deep channel.
Run below if you don't want to get wet.
We'll dive. Try to get in close enough for a clear shot.
When the sonar picks up the beast, let me know immediately.
This should do it, sir.
We're clear to shipping now.
- Range?
- All back full.
- All back full!
- Stand by, forward torpedo room.
- Stand by, forward torpedo room.
- All stop.
- All stop!
All stop, sir.
We're in too close for my taste, but it can't be helped.
We'll just have to fire our torpedo, run for it... and explode it after we're out of range.
We'll let those flamethrowers have a whack at it first.
We need a better target.
That's it.
Number one torpedo, fire!
Fire!
We're caught fast, sir.
- This is where we came in.
- What do we do now?
We explode our torpedo and get blown apart ourselves... or we think faster than we've ever thought before.
I want a man to stand by the escape hatch.
Break out an Apua-Lung and some of that plastic explosive we were issued.
I nominate myself, if you're calling for volunteers.
This is a personal matter, Griff.
I'm reserving that pleasure for myself.
Maneuvering, are we still backing full?
We're giving you all she's got.
Very well.
As second in command, it's my turn to try.
No, it's mine. You don't know where the monster's vulnerable. I do.
You want to argue about it, or you want to get free right away?
And don't waste time.
I'll need some explosive and a harpoon gun.
Hanson, diving suit and harpoon gun, on the double.
Aye, aye, sir.
Fuse. Timer to set for as long as you need.
Thank you very much.
Whatever he did, he knew his stuff.
It worked.
When the range opens up, set off the torpedo.
But the captain's still out there, and that other fellow too.
I know it. I'm obeying the captain's last orders.
You'll do as much for mine.
Range: 1-0-0-0.
Fire!
No trace of'em.
Yes, there is!
There they are.
Get 'em in sight.
Left full rudder.
Starboard ahead two-thirds.
The Army and the Navy and our gallant police and fire departments... these have all received the honors they deserve from a grateful city.
But there are three others who served San Francisco... who also must not be forgotten.
And, therefore, a memorial plaque today... has been presented to those unsung heroes: the Civilian Defense volunteers... the crossing guards... and street railway employees of this city.
Well, I guess that's it.
The sub's been ordered on patrol.
I'll be on sea duty for a few months.
I'll be seeing you, John.
- Soon, I hope.
- Will I be seeing you, Leslie?
You mean when I get back from Cairo?
I mean, women can change, move away, get married... have families.
Well, there is that possibility, but...
A, there isn't time for that to happen to me...
B, I can be reached at the school, and...
C, how would you like to collaborate with me on a book...
How To Catch a Sea Beast?
Doctor, you were right about this new breed of woman.
THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME
Some years ago, while visiting...
or rather exploring Notre Dame,
the author of this book
found on one of the towers
this Greek word carved on the wall.
FATALITY
The word made the author wonder
what kind of tortured soul
would want to leave behind
this kind of infamy and crime
on the old cathedral.
Today, no trace remains
of this mysterious word,
nor of the tragic life it recalled.
Yet this book is based on that one word.
Victor Hugo, February 1831.
- I am Jupiter.
- Me too!
I know it's rather bold and too severe for a Feast, but it offers a new moral with many details that are quite risqué.
How do you know that?
I am Pierre Gringoire, the author.
- Charity, please.
- Silence!
- Charity!
- Charity...
Faith and Hope!
Hope that the play will be good.
- Quiet, the Cardinal's here.
- And the Ambassadors.
To Hell with them!
Today is freedom for all!
- I am Jupiter!
- You've already told us!
Just listen!
They've all gone mad!
Michel, let me quieten them.
The Mystery is entitled,
"The Virgin Mary's judgement".
Charity!
Silence!
You'll see Venus, the Virgin Mary, the Golden Dolphin and the Queen of Golconda.
But when will it start?
Enough! Bring on the mummers!
We also have the Feast of Fools.
In Flanders, they're up to all kinds of mischief.
It's a proper sight!
- Good day, Clopin!
- Greetings!
This beggar is a real king.
We met in Antwerp.
- I'm much travelled.
- Yes... but in Antwerp you had no arms!
I was cured on a pilgrimage.
When suddenly...
the radiant Princess was chosen
by the Virgin Mary.
The Golden Dolphin,
heir to the French throne,
saw it in a dream...
Come, Angels, if you fear not!
That's not in the play!
At last, some foolery.
It was beginning to bore me.
- A Mystery with no music...
- ...is too mysterious, I'd say.
- I didn't say that.
- Don't worry. Leave it to me.
Good people!
I don't know what we're doing here when we have a king to elect.
A play, however edifying, should not shroud this other event.
Long live the fools!
Wait for me, Clopin.
The word of the people is the Word of God.
But luckily, only once a year.
Clear that away!
- It's the grey man!
- Killjoy!
Sour face!
- It's allowed today.
- Not in the square.
- Everything's allowed!
- If you don't like it...
- ...we'll strip you!
- To your birthday suit!
Go to Hell!
Leave me.
Claude, the play can wait!
Lend your brother some money.
- For the Feast.
- This charade?!
- Where would my money go?
- To a cabaret.
- You have no soul.
- And yours is dead!
Mine's alive and in need of money!
- To the Devil with you!
- He's my friend!
Your meanness won't help me.
I'll turn to crime instead.
Master, I'm so grateful you came.
To see what? A disaster!
It's all gone.
Public, Cardinal, Ambassadors, music.
Those who go do not compare to those who stay and enjoy sacred music.
Djali!
The Feast of Fools has made her mad.
Esmeralda!
- It's Esmeralda!
- Gilles, don't you dare go!
Esmeralda?!
- Where is she from?
- Egypt.
She dares to dance on the square.
I'm trying to put a stop to it.
- A fearful creature.
- Indeed. She has ruined me.
No, the play was already ruined.
She has just finished the job.
In a light-footed way!
- Madame!
- It's the coronation.
Thank you.
- Here, take it.
- It's ours?
Today's a Feast. It's for you.
- And you?
- Everyday is a Feast.
Here.
Come, Djali.
Djali... The sound of far-off lands which evoke dreams.
You hear, Djali? Say thanks.
He's not ugly or funny!
There's lots like him about!
He's the best. He's the winner.
Long live the King of Fools!
Clopin, King of Coins, does the Court of Miracles approve?
You know him.
Is he any different?
I'll ask the Duke of Egypt,
King of gypsies.
He is already Emperor of Galilee.
Why refuse him other honours?
Not so fast! Here's the best!
Quasimodo!
Long live King Quasimodo!
Quasimodo, of course!
He grimaces from head to toe!
Move away!
Quasimodo, King of Fools!
The bells have made you deaf.
Deaf as a coot! Deaf as a boot!
King of the Deaf, hear our prayers.
He's so handsome!
She'll pay for that!
Once you've seen her, you'll never love another.
What good is a bed without her?
- Ask her!
- No! Not because I'm shy, mind you.
I just know she's not for me.
Nor us, yet we are her Kings!
- So whose is she?
- Tell us... We'll kill him!
I can hear music.
Yes!
It's like the bells.
Like thunder and lightning!
I can hear it.
What are you doing all alone?
- Come on, tonight's for love.
- Tonight's for living.
- Sacrilege!
- He's a killjoy!
Judas!
Sleep, good folk! It's 11 o'clock!
It's 11 o'clock! Sleep, good folk!
Sleep?! Easier said than done.
If sleep had a house,
I'd knock at his door.
- Master...
- Go!
You've changed.
- You seem to have... grief.
- Grief?
What else can I have?
Life is no Feast for me.
Go fetch her!
Master...
- She's so beautiful.
- Too bad for her, too bad for me.
Is it my fault how she dances?
Is it my fault her beauty drives me wild?
Go!
See?
You're trapped.
Help!
- The bell-ringer!
- The scoundrel!
Tie his legs up!
Arrest him!
- Only got one eye!
- Enough to look at girls!
- Thank you.
- Pretty mouth.
I'd love to see it in the light.
Beautiful!
Like a King's mistress!
You're trembling, my sweet.
I was so afraid.
You're not afraid of me kidnapping you?
You're different. You rescued me.
What's your name?
- Phoebus.
- It's nice.
- It means "the Sun".
- The Sun...
- Where to?
- Where indeed?
A nightlong ride with the Sun, till your horse stops at daybreak.
You are too lovely to wait till day!
There's a room.
The clean one upstairs.
Goodnight, Sun.
Am I to sleep alone?
- Sleep with your dreams!
- But you are my dream!
My dream for tonight.
Goodbye Sun. And thank you.
Pity! She was beautiful.
Beautiful, but a bit dishevelled.
That's just the way I like them!
Charity, please!
Last week I gave away the shirt from my own back.
I myself have no money to eat.
Nor to afford a bed.
We're not asking about you...
We're asking for charity!
Give us a little, or else we'll have the whole lot away!
You shouldn't have come here!
I don't disagree.
I am a victim of fate...
And somebody stole my hat.
- His hat!
- They took his hat!
- Who did?
- Here's one, for the meantime.
Look, a sinner!
He looks ripe for a hanging!
- Where am I?
- The Court of Miracles.
Then I'm not surprised...
A cripple just stole my hat.
Stole?!
He's moaning to us about stealing!
Are you so virtuous, then?
No, but I've never harmed anyone.
But you have broken the rules of our kingdom!
You came in with no credentials.
- And he came in running!
- In such a hurry to die?
You're not really going to...
We like to see an honest man swinging on a rope.
It's more honourable.
- What is your trade?
- I'm a poet.
In other words, you are a liar and a beggar!
The noose makes the tongues of poets and kings look the same as a robber's.
But... before you're hanged you'll get a fair trial.
A man's about to meet his fate.
Poor devil!
But justice must be done!
And ours is as good as the King's.
He doles out justice in iron cages!
Cages much too small for me!
Come, my lovelies, some justice will do us good!
Executioner, do your job!
- But I'm innocent!
- Like a lamb.
Innocent lambs makes better roasts!
I remember you.
You're the writer of that Mystery.
I am indeed the author of
"The Virgin Mary's Judgement".
I am Pierre Gringoire.
Is boring us to death good reason not to die?
You seem repulsed.
You bourgeois are too idealistic!
- Now if you were a criminal...
- I'd like to become one!
Have you ever cut someone up?
No, but if I'd known I should have,
I'd have tried.
He seems willing!
He'll make a fine corpse!
Executioner, do your duty!
Wait! We used to say... you can't hang a man if some woman wants him.
That's taking bread from my mouth!
Don't worry!
You'll have plenty of time to eat.
You are lucky, little man.
Fortune smiles upon you.
You can choose between a wench or the rope.
Either way I'm done for.
But I do prefer...
The wench!
Here, my lovely ladies!
Anyone fancy this one?
Hey, Colette! Elisabeth!
Marie and Marie!
Hey, Claude! Isabeau!
He'll cost you nothing!
Any takers?
One squeeze and I'd kill him!
Good for a kiss and cuddle.
But I'm past it!
I need someone useful.
- If I have him you'll be jealous!
- Cut him up, we'll share him!
You never find exactly what you're looking for!
Friend, you've no luck!
Nobody want him?
Going... Going...
Gone! Hang him!
Wait!
- Are you hanging him?
- Unless you want him.
I'll take him.
- You're joking?!
- No.
Death may be fun for you, but not for me.
She likes him!
I'd have let you hang and applauded.
Prepare the ceremony!
Throw it down.
Brother, she's your wife.
Sister, he's your husband.
For four years!
No curtains on the riverbank
No locks in the forest
The pretty girl runs The pretty girl swims
Dressed only in secrets
Only the Sun can undress her.
Did you make that up?
Nothing is made up.
It's all planned.
I recall things.
My troubles or grief...
And my desires.
It seems simple for you.
What do you do, poet?
If it doesn't come, I look.
- Where? In there?
- Alas!
Poor Gringoire! Why be a poet?
I was a good-for-nothing...
I was orphaned at six.
I grew up and tried anything.
I was a soldier, but I wasn't brave enough.
I was a monk, but I wasn't devout enough.
And I'm not a good drinker.
So I became a poet.
I've written a few books!
600 pages on the comet of 1465.
600 pages on a shooting star?!
Boring!
But now it's over.
You can turn to crime!
- Crime?
- Yes.
At night people are in the street...
You wait for them...
And kill them!
Or you can just rob them!
- But I'm so clumsy.
- So be a beggar!
Blind... one-armed... crippled!
- It's up to you.
- But I'm in good health.
I just said it to scare you.
You can work with me and Djali.
Help her with her writing!
- She writes?!
- Like you and I.
She'll learn a new word.
Do you hear, Djali?
Phoebus!
That means "the Sun".
- I know.
- He was an archer god.
- God...
- There were many to choose from.
- I've chosen...
- The Court of Miracles!
I was tired, hungry and about to die.
Now I'm saved, fed and off to bed!
A bed and a woman!
What a woman! And she's mine!
It seems a bit hard.
And a little small for two.
Don't you agree?
I'm sleeping in there as always.
- Why did you marry me?
- I couldn't let you hang.
So you just wanted to save me from the gallows?
Why else?
Why else?! I don't know...
Or rather I do, alas!
Goodnight, Gringoire. Sweet dreams.
- Charity!
- Wonderful thing, charity!
He's the King of Misers.
Thanks Your Majesty.
I'm getting too old for all this climbing.
Let's hope it's worth it.
You'll see, Sire. He's a strange one.
Remember, Charmolue, in front of Frollo I'm not the King.
I'm a friend from Touraine.
What are they doing up there?
- Thunder damage!
- May Notre Dame protect them.
Like me, she'll have coins on her hat.
It's here, Sire.
He lives like a hermit.
Certain women's names are so soft, so mysterious one has only to pronounce them during the experiment...
See, Sire, he's doing research.
He could hang for it.
What if he finds the secret of gold?
It would improve our finances.
And there's plenty of other witches to burn!
Let's go in.
I have tried medicine and astrology: nothing!
The human body: darkness!
The stars: darkness!
Master, I am a humble squire from Touraine, who bows before scientists, but allow me to ask you a question.
What do you believe in?
- In God.
- Our Father.
What else?
I believe in alchemy.
Gold is the light.
Gold?
- Have you made gold?
- If I had...
I would be King of France, instead of Louis.
- If the King heard...
- He'd merely ask after your work.
I have not worked for so long without seeing before me a light... a flame!
A flame?!
Tell me, Master... does your science not displease Our Lady?
I am sure Our Lady keeps watch over my work.
I respect men of science and letters.
You, in particular.
Come soon to the Bastille, where we may speak in peace.
Arise!
There is no King here.
We are too near Heaven.
Will you cast spells on us with your bells?
Antichrist!
Son of a witch!
Half-formed freak!
Something's happening in my good city!
Who are we whipping?
You should know, as Procurer to the King.
It's Quasimodo, Sire.
The people's pet hate.
The bell-ringer.
I can feel each lash myself.
Master Frollo brought him up.
He tried to teach him to read.
What has he done, this naughty boy?
He assaulted a gypsy girl last night.
Master, don't take it to heart.
After all, he's not a monk!
A man who lives apart from others, away from life, far from women, even despised by women...
Nature lays horrible traps for men like that.
This trap was particularly lovely!
Making temptation more dreadful!
It's not like the good old days!
You're here for fun but... Charity!
Thirsty...
That makes two of us!
Here!
- Help yourself.
- Don't be mean!
That's like closing the oasis to a man in the desert!
Three turns of the timer and you're done!
Here, water in easy reach.
Shame your hands are tied!
He's a villain. He's a maggot.
Drink!
He's thirsty.
Why not give him water?
Beautiful... Beautiful!
Beautiful!
Thank you, good people.
In a moment, Esmeralda will stun you with Djali, the magic goat!
What are you doing?
Words cannot feed me.
By the way, I got married.
Married?
In a rather strange way.
But to a beautiful woman.
You abandoned God to have this Egyptian girl?
I've not touched her, if that's what interests you!
But you say man and wife?
She's a simple, charming girl.
Fond of dancing and the outdoors.
Swear you did nothing!
I tried to.
On the wedding night.
- Through the door, I saw...
- Stop!
- The most beautiful...
- Stop!
- Gringoire!
- Excuse me, Master.
Work!
Here is Djali, who not only reads but can also write.
This goat's knowledge has no bounds.
It's a miracle.
Letters hold no secrets from her.
Today, she has only one name on her mind.
She read it shining in the stars.
It's a beautiful name meaning, "the Sun".
Witchcraft!
Phoebus!
How incredibly modest you are!
To slay a dragon and not tell your betrothed!
The dragon was more of a gargoyle!
Whatever!
The girls have been excited for days.
Neptune has suffered.
And the monks expect him at the abbey.
Lucky Neptune!
Am I jealous?
I am loved by a mermaid and have the right to love her back.
- What words!
- What feelings! From the heart.
Let your heart speak.
Had I a sister, I would prefer you to her.
Had I gold, I would lay it at your feet.
Had I a harem, you would be my favourite.
- Look, your Egyptian!
- My Egyptian?!
The one you saved.
I heard she had a white goat.
Possibly. It was dark,
I didn't get a good look.
Her dancing draws crowds.
May I be jealous before our wedding?
Chase her away to make me happy.
Easy! I'll give the orders.
Prove your love to me...
Chase her off yourself!
You left me all alone in the middle of the night.
Didn't expect to see me?
I did.
- Didn't forget me?
- Didn't try.
You are deep in my memory.
Here... How could I forget?
- What are you doing here?
- Following orders.
Be off with you!
The Place de Grève is good enough for you lot!
Goodbye! If my friends go, I go.
Can we meet again?
Why not?
- Tonight?
- Where?
The same place.
Where you left me.
The little house.
Will you come?
Perhaps.
Until tonight, Sun!
Mother, he loves me so!
Like your father loved me!
Where to now? "The Golden Cat"?
- I have a date.
- But I'll fall down without you!
Anyway, Esmeralda can wait, as she's so in love with you!
Maybe she's too impatient.
You can't abandon a friend for a woman!
This is a farewell party!
- Farewell? Why?
- Because...
I'm turning to crime.
Thanks to my brother!
You won't see me again.
Unless it's to arrest me or put a noose round my neck.
That's your job, after all.
My head's spinning.
Goodnight, villain!
In a poor man's bed you have rich dreams.
You were helping me to walk, too!
Stop!
Listen!
The statue's speaking.
I thought you were two statues, mind you.
- You have an appointment?
- With love.
And may I inform you... it's with the Queen of Egypt and her pyramids!
You speak both lies and the truth.
- You must be from Heaven!
- You are pitiful!
Pitiful? Me?!
He has a way with words!
Walk with me, statue.
Tell me some miserable things.
There's nothing like misery to cheer me up.
Help me cross the Red Sea.
I'm stuck between two types of wine!
Don't go to your appointment.
The woman is married.
So what's new?
I'll be married soon, too.
Why should love only sleep with marriage?
See that light?
It's time to say goodnight!
She's married and pure!
You can't!
Not even her husband has touched her.
Attacked by a hunchback, left by her man, protected by a shadow!
She must be a real queen.
- A queen waiting for her king!
- Have pity!
- Pity on whom?
- On her!
On her husband and his jealousy!
Goodnight, shadow... and thanks.
She's been waiting upstairs.
- For long?
- Love knows no time!
No, don't kiss me yet.
I'd like... all women to be in love with you.
Especially the most beautiful.
And I'd like...
- ...you to pass them by.
- Jealous already?
A little.
What is beauty compared to me?
Ugliness!
What if I were jealous?
- Of all men?
- Of your husband.
Gringoire? If you saw him, your jealousy would fade.
So you did marry?
Yes, but only to save his life.
I didn't give him mine.
That's for me alone.
I'm keeping it for the man I love!
Have you yearned for love?
Yes, but I have been happy.
Happiness is a gypsy's trade.
- But I was waiting for love.
- Have you found it?
Does he love me?
Don't doubt it.
If he loves me, as I do him...
- If he truly loves me...
- Child...
I have spoken meaningless words of love just to make someone happy.
My love for you is so true,
I've no reason to speak falsely.
Had I a sister, I'd love you more.
Had I gold, I'd give you all.
- Had I a harem...
- You'd be my favourite!
Liar!
I know the song.
- But what did I say to hurt you?
- Nothing. The same as all the others.
The same song.
I'm not sad because you lied... but because I still love you.
I have no use for it now.
Help! Help!
A witch has stabbed the Captain!
I can no longer write.
Maybe you can eat!
She often left without saying anything.
But never with no sign of life or fidelity.
Flowers in a vase...
Wine in a jug...
- Some money in your pocket!
- True.
Now, here I am, either a widower or a cuckold.
No, I trust her.
If she left me for another, she wouldn't hide it.
I'm worried.
She's so beautiful.
Beauty and happiness are like game that is tracked, watched and hunted.
- Just tell me if he's alive.
- Silence, woman!
You are a gypsy witch, in contact with the Devil, who is in the form of the goat that is your accomplice!
What are you saying?
The Devil? You hear, Djali?
Guards, stop them talking!
If this goat resists exorcism, it will be sent either to the stake or the gallows!
A name-writing goat!
A man killed by a witch!
A coin turned into a leaf!
It's obvious.
Bring the witnesses!
- Do you recognise the accused?
- It's her!
And is that her evil-smelling goat?
My poor room was covered in blood.
The loveliest, cleanest one, covered in blood!
And the poor Captain lying in it!
The girl dancing, her goat laughing!
- I swear it was!
- Madame Falourdel... tell us of the dark man who came and went like magic!
With the smell of sulphur and blood!
It was surely he who changed the coin into a leaf.
Here it is!
Pass it round!
A chestnut leaf that sheds no light on an affair that is straightforward.
The witch stabbed the Captain!
It was her knife!
True, the weapon is against her, but...
Continue, Master Frollo.
As an expert in witchcraft, we'll hear you.
I want to say...
There was this strange apparition.
A demon, Master Frollo?
Who knows?
Woman!
- Did you see the dark man?
- No, but he was there.
- You saw him?
- As I see you!
So it was human. What did he do?
As you well know...
He turned a coin into the leaf and disappeared.
Escort the witnesses!
He's clearly a dimwit!
But he was witness to some disturbing events.
It is often the simpletons that see hidden demons.
It's written in demonology texts.
Could it be the demon...
...and not the Egyptian that stabbed the Captain?
So you think she is innocent?
- Maybe.
- But you're not certain?
Girl, you should confess.
It will save you pain.
Kill me if that's what you want.
But just tell me if he's alive.
Yes, thanks to God. Happy?
Happy?
He's alive and you ask if I'm happy?
So why am I here?
He must have told you I'm innocent.
His statement says he recalls nothing.
He didn't defend me?!
Although he knows it wasn't me.
Or, if he does know... it's even more horrible, more sad.
It's of no matter.
I'm happy nonetheless.
I did him no harm.
- Love saved his life.
- Love...
Life...
Those are the words of a witch!
Of a most dangerous witch!
And the demonic dark man... even if he did the stabbing, it was while he was under the spell of this witch.
Woman, do you still deny it?
Given the obstinacy of the accused,
I demand an inquisition.
Agreed.
Do you still deny the facts?
There is nothing to deny.
None of what you say is true.
None of it!
Then I am forced to carry out my duty.
Where shall we start?
The foot clamp.
Take that away!
Proceed.
Stop!
Do you admit your contract with evil?
Evil? Yes, I know evil.
I'll confess what you want.
We only want the truth.
- Speak.
- I'm in pain. Give me a moment.
Speak!
I know the forces of evil.
I killed a bird for singing too well.
I pushed a child in the Seine for laughing gaily.
Don't bother us with that!
Did you stab Captain Phoebus?
Yes, I stabbed him while he was kissing me.
And I danced with the dark man.
Djali is the devil and my husband.
His real name is Gringoire, King of Rats.
The truth is out. Take it off.
That wasn't too bad.
You'll still be able to dance.
Please witness that we proceeded as gently as possible.
- But it hurt.
- Humanity obliges me to say your confession condemns you to hang.
On a day that pleases the King, you'll be taken to confess at Notre Dame, and from there to the Place de Grève, where you will be hanged on the city gallows.
At the Court of Miracles,
I was afraid of the rope and gallows.
But now it seems so simple.
So simple!
At Notre Dame, come and see
The woman hang from the gallows tree
It's a terrible thing
To see a young girl swing
Is there no more pity
In this God-forsaken city?
Alive today
Tomorrow the rope
Sweet Lord Jesus, is there hope?
We burn or hang so many witches we don't their names.
This gypsy girl
So I sing
Killed a captain
In the service of the King...
What's so good
What's so cruel
Do you hear me?
How do we understand
A soul so dark
And a face so soft?
I always like to see a pretty girl in a gown!
Are they hanging the goat?
Last year, they hanged a pig!
At Notre Dame, come and see
The woman swing from the gallows tree
Alive today, tomorrow the rope
Sweet Jesus...
Master Judge!
Sanctuary!
Man's justice ends at the Cathedral door.
Sanctuary!
Don't be afraid.
The rope... has gone.
I'm even uglier when I laugh. But...
I smile when I'm happy.
This is where I live.
Make yourself at home.
That's my bed.
Away!
- I was stupid when I fetched you...
- Keep away!
I'm going.
If you need me... blow on this.
I can hear it.
Please...
Don't be afraid.
You brought me water.
I'll bring you food.
I'll put it there.
Stay inside or they'll kill you.
If they kill you...
I'll die.
What's he been up to all this time?
He's all alone. Maybe he's asleep.
Nobody comes here to sleep.
Maybe he's dead.
Creatures from Hell!
What do you want?
She's guilty, you hear?!
Guilty of living! Guilty of being!
Guilty like you! Like this dimwit!
Guilty like me!
Now it's over...
May her soul rest in peace.
And my soul! Mine!
God! What about mine?!
Go away!
Alive! You're alive!
Who brought you here?
God or the Devil only know...
I know you!
You're the liar from my trial.
You were the worst one of all.
- Listen...
- You accused me and then they tortured me.
- You're the dark man.
- Quiet!
The dark man who stabbed Phoebus was you.
- Forgive me.
- Why did you want him dead?
Why did you want me dead?
What do you want of me?
You ask what I want with you?!
Sanctuary!
He was the one who told me to go and fetch you.
I know. I realise now.
I fear you less than him.
Don't go. Don't leave me alone.
- Can't hear...
- You... sleep... there.
Why are you hiding?
You don't want me to look?
In a land where they looked like you they'd throw stones at me.
I've always been ugly.
Always scared people.
I didn't care.
But to scare you... brings me pain.
For me?
With this, my hanging gown is almost pretty.
My foot doesn't hurt.
The judge was right.
I can still dance.
Look!
That's Big Marie.
She made me deaf.
But we're still friends.
The music is for you!
Only for you!
- The bells have gone mad!
- It's the gypsy!
Fine music for a fine queen.
Charity!
- Do you like them?
- Yes.
Thank you, Quasimodo.
See? You'll be fine here with me.
And the birds.
But they fly away.
Poor Quasimodo...
Do you really think we'll stay here together all my life?
They are bad down there.
Phoebus!
He didn't even look.
And yet he knows I'm here.
Do you want him to come?
I saw it in your eyes when you called.
It was just a memory.
Yes, go and fetch him!
I want to see him to tell him I no longer love him.
And that I also was only pretending.
Go!
Sanctuary...
To think that a pagan creature of the Devil can be safe in the House of God!
Sit down, Phoebus, you're wounded.
By her!
Fleur de Lys is more wounded than I.
I wish to apologise to her.
How long will she stay up there mocking our laws?
- Years, perhaps.
- She's wild.
She'll try to escape.
We'll see her
- ...and we'll have her.
- Hang her, you mean?
Hang her!
Won't that be just?
I am a soldier.
Even if my heart can forgive,
I will always obey the laws of the King.
Well said!
Phoebus, I have nothing to hide.
To forget her sorrow,
Fleur de Lys has also found sanctuary.
In the Abbey, on our land, which may become yours.
- You allow me to...
- She doesn't want to see you.
That means she's waiting for you.
- He looks happy.
- He's married.
To a witch!
Wait! Don't go.
She's up there.
Good for her. That way she'll live.
Take her flowers.
She likes flowers. Make her happy.
I told her I'd fetch you.
- Let me by.
- No.
She wants you to come.
She loves you!
If she didn't, I'd kill you!
Don't worry, Djali.
I won't be too naughty.
At first, I won't say I don't love him.
And then,
I'll show how happy I am to see him.
He wouldn't come.
I brought you some flowers.
I got them down there.
You're crying.
I was lying.
He's coming. He told me himself.
He bought the flowers for you.
You're a bad liar.
You're too honest.
Are you happy?
Poor Quasimodo!
If Phoebus had your heart, the world would be beautiful.
You were right to consult your friend from Touraine.
In God's name, the sanctuary law is sacred.
The people would be up in arms.
And if that happens, we'll end up killing them, which will cost us a great deal.
At least the Bishop we've come to see is an erudite man.
He will give excellent advice,
Master Frollo.
- Mercy!
- Sire, Mercy!
What good is the King's mercy without the foresight of judges?
A weakness!
- I'm innocent!
- I wish it were true.
I'm not here to cause you grief but to seek your advice.
- From me?
- Yes. I have a problem...
I'm sure you can shed some light.
Light?!
I haven't seen the sun in 14 years!
I was talking about your knowledge.
And they say solitude helps the memory!
Sanctuary law! That's my problem.
- Sanctuary is...
- A wonderful thing! We know.
But we want to know if there have been times when the law was not broken, but...
- You know what I mean.
- Yes, Sire.
Sanctuary has been overruled in the name of God and the State.
The Bishop of England, allowed a magician to be arrested in church.
St. Louis, King of France, did a similar thing at St. Paul's.
Enough! We won't forget this.
Mercy, Sire! Take pity!
Our Lady of Paris, forgive me.
I must punish the gypsy.
She is a witch who is unworthy of your protection.
It will be this once, and I'll donate a silver statue.
Lovelier than the one
I gave to Notre Dame of Ecouys.
Amen!
Poet, she's your wife!
- Not really.
- I know. Charity!
You will go to her for us.
Tell her we won't forget her.
- They won't let me up.
- Afraid of her guardian?
- Not exactly, but...
- Whatever! Just do it!
- Master, I wanted to ask...
- Not now.
About my wife...
If she were your wife before God,
I would pity you.
Why have they taken down the Good Lord?
- He'll be back tomorrow.
- Once justice is done.
Thus, he won't see his House profaned.
Get it? The sanctuary law...
If we do nothing, you'll be a widower.
Go away, there's nothing to see.
Until tomorrow,
Notre Dame is not a place of worship.
Come with me, Quasimodo.
You can be saved.
No, I know...
You want to hurt her.
Sanctuary!
Sanctuary!
The gallows is waiting
Try to escape
Hang the executioner
Who's whistling in the yard
The gallows is waiting
The hangman's noose
Runs from Issy to Vanvre
Is made with sisal not with wheat
No one steals the hangman's noose.
- Whose is the horse?
- I'd let down my brother, if I went into battle on foot.
I want to please him.
If I ever come across the cursed sowl, he'll be blind, not one-eyed!
It's you. You scared me.
You look wonderful in that!
Old armour makes the best soup.
Blood soup!
Don't move!
Poets need models, like painters.
Thank you. You are stored in my mind.
There's a place for you in my epic.
Many shall die!
Alas!
Many shall die, alas.
If I were one of them, this song for her,
by me, eaten by rats,
would later be sung by Esmeralda.
You don't risk dying, here.
If I were there I'd die of fright.
Then who would write my epic?
Who could describe fear like I?
This fear of fear...
In line, Egypt!
In line, Argot!
In line, Galilee!
Louis, Bishop of Paris!
I, Clopin, King of Coins,
Prince of Argot, Bishop of Fools, declare...
If your church is sacred, so is our sister!
If she is not, neither is your church!
Our sister, wrongly condemned, has taken refuge inside!
You must give her sanctuary!
To save the church, hand over the girl!
Or we'll take the girl and pillage the church!
In the name of whatever, I plant my banner.
May God protect you, Bishop of Paris!
Don't forget, there are 40 chests of gold inside!
Forward! To work!
To work, locksmiths!
The sky is falling on us!
These men are afraid of anything!
These doors won't budge an inch!
Here's the ram to enter Notre Dame!
Charge!
Courage, gypsies!
Tear it down!
Don't be afraid. Go back to sleep.
They want to hurt you.
But I'll kill them first.
Stop!
They are my friends, my brothers!
Don't be afraid.
They are trying to rescue me!
There're many of them...
But you'll see!
It's alright. Go back to sleep.
To victory!
We have the ladder from the bridge!
To the battering ram!
To the gold!
Long live crime!
Sanctuary!
You want to hurt her, too.
By God, I have no faith, no law,
No fire, no place
No god, no king
My brother's soul We condemn to Hell!
I have no soul
So I won't go!
Come on, the lock is giving!
They're coming in.
Come, I'll hide you.
One more charge from the battering ram!
We'll have our hands on the gold!
Look, Mathias, it was worth it!
Cut them down!
Cut them down!
Life is wonderful!
Charity for her, please.
My job is done!
Though she be dead, hang her!
She was judged and condemned.
They've gone.
It's over.
It's all your fault!
During the night of Esmeralda's death,
the grave diggers
took down her body from the gallows
and took it to the catacombs at Montfaucon.
Two years after these incidents,
they found two skeletons,
one mysteriously holding the other
in a fond embrace.
When they tried to move them,
they turned to dust.
Eric.
Wayne.
It was good of you to come, busy as you are.
Never too busy for an interesting case... especially one ofyours.
Thanks.
Appreciate your interest.
On the phone you said... you were having a serious problem with a young girl.
Yeah- Nurse here, as a matter of fact-.
- Pretty?
- Here's her case history.
- Jane Marvin.
- Yeah, that's the name she's using.
- Very competent girl.
- And pretty.
It happened when she volunteered... to help me in my research in narco-hypnosis techniques.
- When do I get to see her?
- Right now if you want.
- Fine.
- jane, would you come in, please?
Yes, sir,.
She always appeared perfectly normal.
Pure accident that I discovered this strange thing about her.
Yes, Doctor?
Jane, I'd like you to meet Dr- Lorimer.
He and I were halfthe football backfield at med school. I did the blocking.
- How do you do, sir?
- Very happy to know you,jane.
I wanted Dr. Lorimer to be present at our research experiment today.
- That is, if you have no objection.
- No. Why should I?
Fine.
Excuse me.
WelLJane, here we go again.
Okay.
Got a nice sharp one for you this time.
Now,jane, start counting backwards-
From 20. I know.
That's right.
I've never known a subject under Pentothol to lie.
- Nor have I.
- Why the lie detector?
You'll see later.
What is your name?
Joyce...
Hatten.
Joyce Hatten
Webster.
Then you are married?
I was.
I was Mrs. Paul Webster.
- That is-
- Yes?
I'm not sure... whetherl am married...
or ever reallym. was married.
I'm not sure.
I'm just not sure.
Would you tell us about itjoyce?
Everything about it.
Everything?
That's rightjoyce.
From the beginning.
I met Paul overseas.
He was a lieutenant.
I was nursing in a hospital.
We made plans to be married... after we were both discharged.
Oh! Ho-ho!
Very well done, steward.
- Isn't he an expert, Paul?
- Well, he gets lots of practice.
After all, we aren't the first newlyweds... on this train,
Mrs. Webster.
Call me that again.
- Mrs. Webster.
- Mmm, that sounds so wonderful.
You know,
I was beginning to doubt... whether I was ever going to get to hear that-.
Youjust try and get away now.
Will there be anything else, sir?
Oh, no. No, thanks.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.
Paul...
I love you so much.
Why did we have to wait so long?
Well, I, uh...
I wrote you after I cracked up my plane-.
And scared me halfout of my wits.
You wouldn't believe what that hospital doctor told me when I called.
Well, what do you mean?
Well, according to him, you were more dead than alive.
Almost every bone broken.
Completely torn, mangled, smashed.
And you don't think it was true?
Well, now, how could I?
Look at you.
You haven't got a mark.
You haven't got a scar.
You're much more handsome than ever.
Do you know that nobody would believe... you were even in a plane crash?
But it was true, thoughJoyce.
By all rights,
I should be dead.
You don't mean that.
Lookjoyce, you have a right to know. I...
I should have told you before we were married.
- Told me what?
- How it was really.
Why I made us wait so long-.
You see, honey-
- Who is it?
- It'; me again.
- I have some more wires.
- And nobody was supposed to know... we were even on this train.
Come in.
Here you are, miss.
- Thank you. Here, you open these.
- All righty.
You folks certainly must be popular.
Especially with the telegraph company.
- Oh.
- Is something wrong?
Well, it's from the girls... at the hospital where I worked.
You know, there's such a thing as being too well-informed.
- May I?
- You may not.
Those devils.
Oh, very nice-
An old buddy of mine-.
I didn't know we had so many friends.
Yeah, me, either.
Oh, that's nice.
Ohh.
That's funny.
When's the next stop?
Well, let's see.
Yeah, 33 minutes.
No, it's 35 minutes.
- We're two minutes behind time.
- Not until then?
Actually, there's a mail pickup stop just up ahead. That's why we're slowing down.
- But is there a phone?
- Yes. We only stop for a halfa minute.
No time for anyone to leave the train.
Just so there's a phone.
Paul, what's wrong?
Please, honey, tell me what's so important.
Paul,
I don't understand.
Please explain.
Paul.
Paul, hurry!
Paul!
Paul, hurry!
[Bell Rings J
Hurry. WW'- !
We're moving.
What?
Conductor, you've got to stop the train.
It was supposed to be... the happiest moment of my life- my wedding.
And I'd just seen my husband's face for the last time.
What did you do then,
Joyce?
I was frantic.
I got off at the next stop.
I went back to that platform... but there was no sign of Paul.
Nothing.
No one had placed a call.
No one had seen him.
He'djust vanished.
And then what happened?
You wouldn't believe it was possible... would you?
A man you thought you knew so well... had married, even... could just disappear...
completely
Even after talking to all the people who knew him.
Finding nothing at his last address.
I told the police”.
hired private detectives”. checked with the army.
The only address they had was an apartment hotel.
What about where he was born?
His family?
The army records said Georgia.
Paul had never mentioned his family.
I never thought to ask him.
I loved him.
That's all that seemed to matter.
StilLyou did find something.
Months later.
Going through
Paul's things... as I had a hundred times.
- His fraternity pin.
- And how did that help?
Ichecked with the headquarters.
Wrote them.
They told me that Paul had belonged to their chapter... at Louisiana State University.
So... I went there.
They let me look at the records.
I found an address
Paul had given them... when he enrolled in college.
And where was that?
Bayou Landing- a whistle-stop in the middle...
of the Louisiana swamp country
I was the only passenger to get off
Strangely, there wasnT anothersoul to be seen.
The only evidence oflife was a deserted day coach on the siding...
looking as alone and out of place as I felt.
Well, I'll be.
Somebody meeting you here, sweetheart?
No. I thought- that is, I hoped somebody would come to pick up this.
Well, that's me-
You just didn't get off.
You must have had some good reason.
Do you know a place-
I think it's a plantation-
Called The Cypresses?
Uh-huh.
Would it be too much trouble to take me there?
I'll gladly payyou.
They don't never have no visitors.
- Was they expecting you?
- No, not exactly... but they will know who I am.
Well, for you, sweetheart,
I'll take a chance.
Go ahead. just climb in-.
Go on. Climb in-.
Bet you never seen nothing like that before.
You ever been in the bayou country before?
It's so wild, so primitive.
Yeah, and deadly.
You know how long you'd last... if you got 'I O0 yards off of this road?
Maybe 'I O minutes- lfthe Quicksand didn't get you-... the moccasins would.
And then... then there's always the gators.
Dirty, nasty, slimy gators!
Why did you have to do that?
It wasn't doing you any harm.
No? Well, how do you suppose I got this?
Anyway, baby, we didn't do him no harm.
- Yes, miss?
- I beg your pardon.
I just arrived on the train.
- The train was hours ago.
- I know.
- Were you expected? - I did write, but my letter came back unopened.
- Sol decided-
- What is it, Toby?
This young person, shejust arrived-
Have her come in.
Come in.
Yes, what is it?
This is your place?
Of course.
Well, maybe you can help me.
You see, for a long time...
I've been looking for my husband.
He disappeared the night we were married.
I've searched everywhere.
I've tried everything... and this is my last hope-.
But why should you come here?
At the university
I checked the records.
And at one time, he gave this as his address.
- The Cypresses.
- What is your name, my dear?
Mrs. Paul Webster.
And you say that your husband... this Paul Webster, gave this as his address?
According to the records.
Whoever you are, I don't know what your game is-.- ... coming here, making up fantastic stories.
It's the truth. I can prove it.
You can ask anyone-
Why should I ask anyone or care one way or the other?
Ofwhat possible interest... could your sordid little lie be to me?
I was hoping your name was Webster.
I am
Mrs. Henry Hawthorne.
- And your husband?
- I'm a widow.
I'm sorry to bother you,
Mrs- Hawthorne.- .
But I had to know.
Perhaps you are telling the truth.
It really doesn't matter.
However, I must ask you to leave at once.
Toby, get ahold of Manon.
Have him drive her back to the station.
- But, ma'am-
- What is it, Toby?
There won't be a train till tomorrow.
Oh, you're right, of course.
May we offer you the hospitality-.
Of The Cypresses for the night?
I don't seem to have any choice, do I?
Luann.
Yes, ma'am.
Show Mrs.-
What was your name again?
Mrs. Paul Webster.
Show Mrs. Webster to the guest room.
Yes, ma'am.
Anything you need to be comfortable... just ask Luann.
Thank you.
One minute,
Mrs. Webster.
While you're our guest for the night only...
I must insist on one thing.
- Yes?
- Under no circumstances... will you leave your room.
As I said before...
I don't seem to have any choice, do I?
There was something sinister about The Cypressesi.
As night darkened the house, all the doubts and fears...
which had haunted the long, lone/y miles...
of my search returned'
What secret was Mrs' Hawthorne hiding“.
In this strange, unfriendly house?
Why had she told me not to leave my room?
Toby! Toby!
Find the drunken fool.
Tell him to stop that shooting.
But, ma'am-
Doesn't he realize the girl's still here?
I'll try, ma'am.
Dirty, stinking, slimy gators!
You bit my hand off, didn't you?
I'm gonna spend the rest of my life killing gators.
The rest of my life killing 'em-.
Mr. Manon, you better stop it.
Huh?
Mrs. Hawthorne says stop.
She says she don't want you shooting at gators around here... with that girl here.
The one you brought.
I ain't never gonna stop shootin' gators.
They bit my hand off, didn't they?
I ain't never gonna stop shootin' gators!
No, not never!
Sure, sure.
I know just how you feel.
I don't like 'em, either, but not tonight. Come on.
Do all the guests get room service?
I only do... what Mrs. Hawthorne tell me, ma'am.
Now, will there be anything else?
Luann, those gunshots.
What were they all about?
I don't know, ma'am.
I must go now.
Luann, wait, wait, please.
Somebody has to help me.
- How, ma'am?
- Is it true, everything she told me?
Havel come to the wrong place?
I can't- I wouldn't like to say anything.
Well, can't you tell me anything?
I can tell you this.
This is a trouble house.
Real deep, big trouble.
Like the old country woman in Big Bayou say-
Mrs. Hawthorne, she deal with the evil one.
She got big sorrow.
Just like you'll get if you stay here-.
Go, child. Please go.
This is a trouble house.
Real deep, big trouble.
Yes.
Oh, thank goodness you're back, Mark.
Anything wrong, Vinnie?
She's here, Mark.
Paul's wife.
- How did she find us?
- School records.
It was like being struck by lightning.
We've got to decide what we're going to do about her.
You wait there for me.
I'll be right over.
- You ready, Doctor?
- Yes.
Poor devil.
You didn't have to hit him.
Quickest, simplest way, Doctor.
But these are people.
You don't handle them like animals.
How did it happen?
Only thing I can figure is someone forgot to wet him down on time.
When he comes to...
give him additional hydro-spray therapy
Yes, sir.
Mark!
Oh, hello, Vinnie.
We'vejust had an emergency with number six.
- Is he all right now?
- He's quiet, yes.
But the girl- what are we going to do about her?
So she found his school records.
The one thing we hadn't thought of.
- Such bad luck.
- Not entirely.
I think we both knew... she was bound to find out eventually.
It'sjust unfortunate it happened to be so soon... when we need time.
So much time.
If she should tell anyone, the police, it would spoil our last chance.
Do we have a chance?
I don't really know.
I feel so helpless, Vinnie.
We know so little.
So little.
What about the cobalt treatment?
I said reaction to X ray was encouraging.
Massive radiation from cobalt 6O might be even more effective.
Well, you have the cobalt bomb.
It arrived today.
But don't you see,
Vinnie?
Before I can take the chance with a human being... there must be months of tests-.
Hundreds ofanimal experiments.
We took a chance once before, Vinnie.
No one knows better than you the tragic result.
I have confidence in you, Mark.
Every confidence.
You'll have time.
All the time you need.
The girl will leave on the morning train.
I'll be over before that to talk to her.
I'm as anxious as you are to have her go... but we must make absolutely sure... that she doesn't know anything.
G,'
Somehow I seemed drawn to the music.
A theme that I had heard before...
somewhere.
Who else lived in this strange household?
Who could be playing in the dead of night?
I couldn? rid myself of the premonition”.
that each step was taking me closer...
to the secret contained in this shadowy house.
I had to know.
I had to find out.
Who was he, this man who had been playing?
And why would he run away into the swamp...
when he saw me?
Muddy footprints”.
yet there had been no rain.
And the piano keys-
Still wet...
from his fingers.
What's she doing here?
I don't know.
She came on the train today-
- No notice, no warning.
- And you let her stay?
What could I do?
I couldnT turn her out in the swamp.
Do you think
I wanted her here?
There's no train until tomorrow.
- How'd you find out?
- She was in the hall.
Downstairs?
I locked her in her room.
She's got to leave... on that morning train tomorrow.
I'm Dr. Sinclair.
Uh, Mark Sinclair.
I'm sort of the swamp doctor.
That's my swamp buggy.
I need to get around.
I see. You must keep busy,
Doctor.
Well, why do you say that?
I mean, in an unhealthy environment like this.
Oh, you mean the swamp.
Well, actually, if it were as you say- unhealthy-
None of us would be here.
- Why?
- Well, a few million years ago... most of the land of the earth... musfve looked just about like this-
One great, vast swamp.
It was the cradle oflife... where we all started- in the slime and ooze... at the bottom of a swamp.
- You're completely cynical, aren't you, Doctor? -
I imagine that did sound a bit depressing.
I didn't mean it to.
I'm sorry.
Oh, is Mrs. Hawthorne inside?
Well, she hasn't come down yet.
Has she been ill,
Doctor?
Well, not exactly.
Vinnie- Mrs. Hawthorne- has a few emotional problems.
I like to look in from time to time.
Well, maybe that explains it.
- Explains what?
- Why she locked me in my room last night.
I don't understand.
I took you for a guest ofVinnie's-.
I suppose I am, in a way.
I'm Mrs. Webster.
Mrs. Paul Webster.
That name doesn't mean anything to you?
No. Should it?
I don't know.
Let me explain, Doctor.
Since my husband disappeared,
I've done nothing but search for him...
and I'm going to keep on asking questions.
- What brings you here?
- An old address-
The Cypresses- that I found in Paul's college records-.
You came way down here, traveled hundreds ofmiles... on nothing more tangible than that?
I'd travel much farther on even less.
I find that difficult to believe.
You must've found other evidence.
Why? Unless there is other evidence.
Is that what you mean?
Of course not- I was only trying to say-
You did know Paul, didn't you, Doctor?
I can tell.
What is it, Doctor?
Why won't any of you tell me about him?
What are you all trying to hide?
My dearyoung lady, you're obviously overwrought.
That's understandable in the circumstances.
I wish I could help.
Will you tell Mrs. Hawthorne
I couldn't wait... but I will drop back later?
Thank you.
Be extremely careful'
It generates
3,000 curie units...
ofgamma ray energy
This is the equivalent of six million electron volts of X ray
A few seconds of direct exposure”. would be fatal.
Stand by for lowering position.
- Luann, come here!
- Yes, ma'am.
- Her things are still in her room.
- Yes, ma'am.
You mean she didn't leave?
Well, Toby, he brought the car at train time... but Mrs. Webster, she wouldn't go.
- Well,where is she?
- Well, I believe she in there.
What are you doing?
Looking for answers.
Answers?
You abuse my hospitality.
You were to stay in your room.
You left it.
You promised to leave on the train.
I made no promise.
I was told.
I'm not leaving here,
Mrs. Hawthorne... until I get the answers to the questions that brought me here.
I told you yesterday you were mistaken.
- I thinkyou're lying.
- You can't talk to me like that.
I can say a lot worse.
You had Dr. Sinclair come and talk to me today, didn't you?
Why?
To find out how much I knew?
I know nothing about that.
And another thing-
Who was playing the piano in here last night... in the dark?
Someone who left wet footprints in the carpet?
- Oh,you're imagining things.
- No, I'm not-
Any more than I'm imagining you want to get rid of me... that you've got something to hide.
Hide? Oh, what could I possibly have to hide?
What have you done with my husband?
I don't know what you're talking about.
You did a good job,
Mrs. Hawthorne... wiping out every trace of Paul in his own home.
You almost got away with it.
Got away with it?
Got away with what?
Whatever terrible thing you've done with Paul.
Done to him? Me?
Oh, my God, that's funny.
That really is funny.
I 'd be the last one ever to hurt Paul.
I'm his mother.
His mother?
Mother?
Has she gone?
No, Paul, she hasn't. Paul, what is it?
What happened?
Paul!
Paul, come back!
Paul! Please!
Paul!
Paul!
Paul!
Paul'
Paul'
Paul!
Paul!
Paul!
Paul'
Paul!
Come on.
You ought to have better sense, sweetheart.
Nobody goes out in a swamp on a night like this-
Especial/y a night like this.
Come on. I'll take you back to the house-.
There, now.
Now you sit down.
You sit down.
That's it.
What you needs a drink.
Me too.
I don't understand why you brought me here-.
I just naturally figured you'd appreciate me saving you from that snake.
I do.
- Here- Have a drink-
- I don't think I want it-.
Go on, baby.
It'll do you good.
That's it.
Made it myself.
Hey... you're cold.
You ought to get them wet things off.
Go ahead.
Well, come on.
Get 'em off.
I'll be all right.
Thanks.
All right, baby.
Here.
You get up.
We'll wrap this around you... so you won't catch cold.
Now, come on. Get up.
That's it.
Stop! Let go of me.
What's the matter, baby?
Huh? Didn't I save your life?
Don't you feel like you owe me something?
Why, sure, you do.
You be nice to me.
Maybe I'll tell you some things about this place.
Don't do that.
Don't ever do that!
You're dead!
I'll kill you. alligator man!
Lust like I'd kill any four-legged gator!
You hear me?
I'll killyou!
Oh! Paul, what happened?
- She's not dead?
- Manon. He was drunk.
We should've fired him before.
Toby, carry her upstairs.
Luann, try and take care of her.
Yes, ma'am.
We can't keep her in the dark any longer, Paul.
- I can't do anything.
- She could've been killed tonight.
Is that what you want?
- I love her, Mother.
- Well, that's why she has to know.
- Are you going to tell her?
- I couldn't.
I'll phone Dr. Sinclair.
He'll know what to say.
Oh, why didn't he just let me die?
It'll work out somehow, Paul.
There has to be an answer.
Therejust has to be.
Mark?
Paul.
I understand it came.
The cobalt 60?
Arrived yesterday.
When do we try it?
Not for months.
I explained to your mother.
Combined with the X-ray generator... the bomb will approach the power of a betatron-
A billion electron volts.
So without extensive experimentation-
But there's no time for that.
I want it now.
You don't think
I'd take the risk... after the tragedy
I've caused already?
But you're causing a worse one to my wife.
You said yourselfthe X ray was definitely helping.
Light positive indications, yes.
Then combining X ray with gamma radiation... from the cobalt might cure me completely.
And it might kill you!
Paul... who knows?
I just can't do it, Paul.
It's too great a risk.
We wouldn't be alive at all, any of us, except for you.
We'd probably be better off dead, but-... you can't turn me down.
You owe me this chance... whatever chance there is.
For my wife's sake,
I want it now!
Not tonight!
I'll need at least a day to test it on live alligators... to establish some sort of control standards-.
You'vejust got to understand, Paul.
I haven't the slightest idea what will happen.
Tomorrow night.
Tomorrow night.
Paul... your mother phoned about your wife.
You should've told her, Paul.
I couldn't.
The thought ofjoyce ever seeing me like this-
I just couldn't.
I've agreed to talk tojoyce in the morning.
- But-
- She's going to know everything.
Yeah, get the big one.
You're Mrs. Webster?
Yes.
Dr. Sinclair is expecting me.
The doctor said for you to wait in his office.
Take him out.
Put him in a cage alone.
We'll run the test series on him in an hour.
And bring in another specimen.
I hope you'll excuse me,
Mrs. Webster... keeping you waiting.
This experiment was urgent-
The most urgent of my life.
So, you're a trained nurse,
Mrs. Webster?
- Yes. Yes, that's right.
- Good.
Then you know something of the life processes... of the higher and lower orders.
In species like ourselves... with a highly developed nervous system... bodily functions are controlled principally... by the brain and the nerves.
But in creatures with a less complex nervous development... life processes are governed by chemical substances...
secreted by ductless glands“. and carried in their bloodstream.
Like hormones?
Being a doctor, I was tremendously impressed... by the healing power ofjust one hormone-
Hydrocortisone.
And it occurred to me how much more potent this hormone would be... in a creature with a simpler nervous system-
One that depended on that hormone to live.
For example... there are some small lizards that when attacked... detach their tails completely.
Yet, in a very short time... well, this little fella was well on his way to growing a new one.
There are even one or two species... that can replace an entire limb ifthey've lost one.
Here's something intriguing-
Two similar muscular charts.
You might think they were the same animal... but as you know, this is a man-
This is an alligator.
This is all very interesting, Doctor... but you were going to tell me about Paul.
Everything I've said concerns Paul.
I knew I'd found my life's work.
I wanted to extract this wonderful reptilian substance... and use it to cure human injuries.
Mrs. Hawthorne-
She was still
Mrs. Webster then-
She remarried after Paul's father died-
Mrs. Hawthorne financed my researches... and set up this clinic.
Well, did you succeed?
I isolated a protein chemical... from the anterior pituitary glands... of crocodilians.
- Our common variety is the alligator.
- Alligator?
I injected this substance into the veins ofvolunteers-
Horribly injured, hopelessly mangled accident victims... on the point of death.
It was miraculous,
Mrs. Webster.
Not only 070' those dying men and women live...
but in an incredibly short time, they were completely whole-
Mangled limbs as good as new... as ifthey'd never been injured.
And Paul was one of these?
The worst of the lot.
There was scarcely a bone in his body that wasn't broken- face completely gone...
horribly burned'
“Nobody would even know you were in a plane crash.“
That's what I said to Paul the night we were married.
Can you imagine my feelings?
I thought I'd stumbled on the medical miracle of the ages.
- It certainly seems so.
- Then, over a year later-
Doctor, can you come right away?
It's number six again.
Excuse me.
I'll be back soon.
Maybe you'd better come along, too.
Another sedative,
Doctor?
No.
I'm afraid the brain tissues have been affected.
Try a sun ray.
Yes, Doctor.
Who are these?
My prize patients.
My medical miracles.
- Well, then, these symptoms are-
- The aftereffects.
They began to appear in varying degrees...
about a year after the treatment.
Why? How?
Isn't it obvious?
There was an additional secretion... in the pituitary injection besides the healing hormone-
Something
I didn't know about...
but, in its way, even more powerful'
And the sun ray?
The sun ray has a strong depressant effect... on reptiles.
Makes them lethargic, dormant.
Reptiles?
But these aren't-
They are, aren't they?
Your patients are turning into-
Alligators.
In effect, you can say that.
- Alligator people.
- And Paul?
His symptoms were the last to appear.
When his final test proved positive...
I had to wire him on the train.
He's quiet now.
We can go.
Is there any hope for... for the people?
There may be a possible chance... but a slight one-
A shot in the dark and very dangerous.
Your husband insists upon taking that chance tonight.
What is it?
Massive radiation-
Gamma rays from a cobalt bomb... combined with high intensity X rays-.
We've already noted in Paul... definite positive reactions to X-ray treatment... but what will happen with this...
- I don't know.
- I want to be here.
- I don't think that's wise-
- I want to be here.
I want to see Paul. I want to talk to him before-
You can't keep me away, Doctor.
No, I guess I can't.
Maybe I haven't even got the right.
Paul, please.
Don't run away again.
Dr. Sinclair explained you were coming tonight and why.
I wanted to be here.
Oh.
Paul, it doesn't make any difference.
I'm your wife, and I love you-.
Oh, Paul, darling.
You know all about tonight?
Dr. Sinclair explained.
He told me about the X-ray treatments... and how much better you are-.
I know this'll do it,
Paul.
Why, radiation therapy works wonders.
It'll have to.
You'll come out of that laboratory... as handsome as ever.
Joyce...
I love you.
You know that.
I wouldn't have done this to you- let you see me.
I'd rather have died!
Oh, Paul, please.
Don't say that.
We're... ready, Paul.
If you still want to.
I still want to.
Very well.
Stand by for lowering position.
- Ready, Paul?
- Ready.
Oh, Paul, do you have to do this-... take this chance, knowing the danger?
Whatever happens, either way...
I'm better off than the way I am now.
Oh, Paul.
I'm sorry for the way
I treated you.
Paul was so desperate to keep you from knowing.
We did everything we could.
Now that I know you,
I'm sure we were wrong.
I'm sorry.
Terribly sorry.
Manon!
Where is he?
- Who?
- Paul.
He's not here.
You get out of here.
Mrs. Hawthorne ordered you off this place for good.
I know where he is, where he's got to be!
With the others!
Now you go on!
Get out!
Controls and timing must be precise.
When you're dealing with radioactivity... and billions ofvolts of energy-... the slightest deviational standard... even a few seconds of excess time-.- ... and anything might happen.
What's the exposure interval, Doctor?
No more than 3O seconds.
Absolute maximum.
I determined that on my test alligators.
Definitely.
30 seconds.
No more.
Paul.
Yes?
I'll never be able to tell you... how sorry I am-.
Don't blame yourself.
I certainly don't.
Who can know everything?
You're not God, Mark.
I feel as ifl've been playing at it... and been punished.
Forget it.
You all right?
Fine.
Keep your eyes closed.
Just relax.
Where is he?
Who do you want?
That two-legged gator- Paul.
You better get out of here.
Aw.
Wait! You can't go in there!
Manon! You were ordered to leave.
You have no right here.
Now get out.
Where is he?
I know you got him here someplace.
I forbid you to go in there.
Oh.
So he is here, huh?
Get him out of here!
Why, you-
Get out of here!
So that's where you are.
You can't!
You can't go in there!
No, you ain't him.
You can't be him.
You stay away from me!
Paul!
Paul!
Paul!
Paul'
Paul!
Paul!
Paul!
Paul! Paul!
No!
Don't! Don't! No!
Well, now that you've heard the tape again, what do you think?
This indicates that everything she said is true.
She was married to a Paul Webster who did crash in a plane... and there was a Dr. Mark Sinclair who since disappeared.
Do you believe her story?
That's not important.
Eric... we were both taught that a psychiatrisfs function... is to find mental illness and to cure it.
- As simple as that.
- Obviously.
Now,jane's case-
This girl has lived through a horrible experience... true or not, but she has made... a satisfactory adjustment.
She lives a normal, happy life by completely suppressing it.
An obvious anxiety neurosis... and amnesia suppression.
You didn't need me to tell you that.
No, of course not.
But what am I gonna do, Eric?
Shall I let her go on as she is now or attempt a cure?
Now, all I've got to do is bring her back in here... and play back that tape.
Yes, and perhaps shock her into a complete withdrawal.
Yes.
I don't know, Wayne.
I honestly don't know.
Excuse me, Doctor.
I'm going offduty unless there's something else.
All right.
Thank you.
Oh,jane.
One moment.
Well?
Yes, Doctor?
That's alLjane.
Good night.
Good night, Doctor.
- Good night, Dr. Lorimer.
- Goodn/ghzfljane.
Once, the world was big and no man in his lifetime could circle it.
Through the centuries, science has made man's lifetime bigger and the world smaller.
Now the farthest corner of the Earth is as close as a pushbutton.
And time has lost all meaning as manmade devices speed many, many times faster than sound itself.
Here, near the top of the world, free men struggle with the elements to create some measure of defense to protect that self-same freedom.
Distant Early Warning radar, sensitive electronic devices to detect the presence of objects in the sky, including bombing planes and guided missiles and rain clouds and homing pigeons.
New radar installations must be calibrated by the flying of controlled test flights to check the accuracy of the equipment and to chart a detection profile of the area in order to pinpoint blind spots the radar cannot penetrate.

Snowman Three, this is Test Flight.
Flying vector, 340 degrees from IP.
Angels 10. Speed, 400.
How do you read me? Over.
Everything checks but the altitude, Mitch.
We read you at Angels 9.
Altimeter reads 10,000 on the nose.
Better check the level on the antenna mount.
Roger.
How about Mademoiselle Mathematician?
She got enough numbers to feed into her machines yet?
Do you have all the information you need, Miss Caldwell?
One more run, please. Low level coming in.
One more, Mitch. Vector 105 degrees, low.
Roger. Turning 180 degrees, low approach.
This is Test Flight, over and out.
I didn't know pilots were allowed to do things like that.
Not Air Force pilots, you're right.
But Mitch is an electronics engineer.
He may work for the government, but, ma'am, he kinda makes his own rules.
So does a three-year-old child until his mother spanks him.
- Mother, dear mother, I'm ready if you are.
- I must have left the switch on.
An electronics engineer. A radar officer.
A mathematician and systems analyst.
A radar operator. A couple of plotters.
People doing a job, well, efficiently.
Serious, having fun. Doing a job.
Situation, normal for the moment.
Date, the 17th of the month.
Sky cloudy, overcast. Visibility limited.
Time, 1332 hours.
A significant moment in history.
A moment when an electronics engineer named Mitchell MacAfee saw something in the sky.
Something that was almost the beginning of the end of life on this Earth.
MacAfee reported instantly by radio the sighting of a UFO, an unidentified flying object.
The radar officer replied that it was impossible.
According to the radar scope, except for Mitch's plane, there wasn't a single, solitary object of any nature whatsoever.
Nothing in the sky for a radius of hundreds of miles.
MacAfee didn't care what the radar showed or didn't show.
He knew what he saw with his own eyes.
And he was determined to get a better look.
MacAfee turned, and so did the unidentified flying object heading toward him.
There was no mistaking the urgency in MacAfee's voice.
Something, he didn't know what, but something as big as a battleship had just flown over and past him at speeds so great he couldn't begin to estimate it.
In national defense, it's better to be safe than sorry.
The alert was sounded to scramble interceptors.
- Well?
- Well, what?
Now, let's not play games, Major.
Did your men find it?
Mr. MacAfee, if you were in uniform,
I'd have you under arrest and facing general court martial charges.
Unfortunately, you're a civilian.
- And I can't touch you.
- What are you talking about?
But I can send in a report in on you and I will.
By the time I get through with you,
Mr. Electronics Engineer, you'll be lucky if they let you test batteries for flashlights.
Look, Major Bergen, I was flying a final calibration flight.
I spotted a UFO, I reported it.
Does that make me a criminal, a traitor to my country, or some kind of a psychopath?
MacAfee, you're an electronics man, an expert on radar.
- Sure, that's what they pay me for.
- If there was something in the air, something flying that you could see, would radar pick it up?
- Well, yes, but...
- Would radar pick it up? Yes or no?
- Yes.
- There were three radars on you.
Every minute you were in the air and not one of them, not one, saw anything but you.
- Look, Major...
- You were told this. You knew it.
Nevertheless, you persisted with your little joke.
- Easy now, Bergen.
- You continued to yell wolf until somebody pushed the panic button and scrambled a flight of interceptors.
Great. Great. So your buzz boys flew around, they couldn't find anything, so now you're mad and want me to pay for the fuel they burned up or the time they wasted or something else real smart.
The flight was scrambled and dispersed to cover as wide an area as possible.
And thanks to your not-so-funny false alarm, Mr. MacAfee, one of those planes didn't come back.
Plane and pilot, both are missing.
Major Bergen. What?
Yes. Yeah. Yes. Call out the stand-by crews.
You better reshuffle your duty rosters.
There'll be plenty of sweat on this one.
Look, Major, I'm sorry about the pilot, but that was no false alarm.
Oh, come off it, Mitch. You've done enough harm with your flying battleship.
- Just let it...
- Just a moment, Miss Caldwell.
That call. A Transpolar Airlines plane is reported overdue and missing.
- Oh, no!
- Sixty passengers and a full crew aboard.
Got a distress call from the pilot, then nothing. No more contact.
- Engine trouble?
- No.
The pilot yelled something about a UFO.
Then the radio went dead.
- And our radars?
- Nothing. Nothing but the Transpolar plane.
Alone in the sky.
Well, we're finished up here, Major.
- You got transportation ready?
- Plane and pilot in the field.
- Fly you straight through to New York.
- Thanks. Let's go, Sally.
Hang on. I'll be back in a minute.
Hi, Pete. Getting too rough to work back there.
I thought the poop on the weather was we'd have it soft all the way into New York.
- Seems to be a local front, Mitch.
- How about flying over it?
Can do. Wait till I call in.
This is Air Force Zebra Love 7979 calling
New York International Airport. Over.
Zebra Love 7979.
This is New York International Airport. Over.
Altitude 8,000, air speed 250.
Meeting unexpected storm activity,
Adirondack region.
Request permission to change altitude to 12,000. Over.
Zebra Love 7979. Permission granted. Over.
Zebra Love 7979. Roger. Out.
- Like I said, no sweat.
- Thanks, Pete.
I'll put in a good word for you with the Major.
Oh, thanks loads.
Well, I won't know until I run it through the computer, but it looks like the profiler that dips here like this for an extensive blind spot.
Yeah.
Well, either that antenna is really tilted or we've got a topographical high spot here we didn't figure on that's shading the whole strip.
- Could you get that relief map?
- Oh, yes. Right here.
Mitch. Mitch. Come up here!
- What gives?
- Sit down, Mitch.
- Well?
- Something might be coming up.
- Such as what?
- Unidentified flying object.
- Flew right over us.
- Not you, too.
Oh, save the cracks.
I've already called it in to International.
Mitch, I sure enough saw something like a cloud.
Only it was moving too fast for any cloud.
Right at our course from northeast.
Two bits it never showed up on a single radar scope.
- What?
- Never mind. I don't see anything but sky.
Neither do I, now.
I lost it when it got right overhead.
Where'd that come from?
We don't register a hatful of wind.
Brother, that was more than a hatful.
- Are you all right?
- I think so. How about you?
I'm okay. Pete's in bad shape. Let's go.
Down! It's going to blow up.
What happened? It felt like something collided with us up there.
Yeah. The flying battleship that wasn't there.
- Hello! Hello!
- Here. Over here.
It's good applejack. I make it myself.
Fine for the snakebite.
Hello, Pierre. Mr. MacAfee?
That's right.
That the pilot?
Yeah.
Okay, boys.
They made a reservation for you on a commercial flight into New York City.
Sending a car to take you and the young lady to the airport.
What about the wrecked plane?
We've got orders to seal off the area.
Real hush-hush.
What happened? You tangle with a flying saucer or something?
Oh, nothing so domestic as a flying saucer, Officer. Just a flying battleship.
Well, have a good time with your flying battleship.
Your car will be here soon.
- Where's the plane, Pierre?
- North 14, past the road.
Let's go, boys.
Hello? Oui, this is the farm of Pierre Broussard.
Who? Oh, one moment.
A General Van Buskirk for you,
Mr. MacAfee.
I feel another snakebite coming on.
More medicine.
Well, flying battleship, pink elephant.
Same difference.
You really should try buttermilk instead.
I said it looked like a battleship, not that it was a battleship.
I should have called it an overgrown adding machine.
Then at least you would've believed me.
General Buskirk? MacAfee here.
Yes, sir. I am aware that the pilot called in a UFO.
No, I didn't see anything myself this time.
Neither did Miss Caldwell.
Oh, the radar picked up nothing but our plane in the area.
Well, I was kind of expecting that too.
Joke? False alarm?
Look here, General, what kind of an infantile jackass do you take me for? I tell you that...
Thank you.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
I understand, sir.
When the shepherd cried wolf, they believed him. The first time at least.
Civil Aeronautics Board is sending up an investigating team first thing in the morning.
So is the Air Force, as soon as the CAB is done.
When we get to New York, we're to keep ourselves available for questioning.
This glass must have a hole in it.
Keeps disappearing.
- How's the jug holding up, Pierre?
- You like Pierre's applejack, oui?
Ah, perfect antidote for snakebite, thunder, lightning, and disbelieving generals.
Fill her up, Pierre.
- What's that?
- Something scared the animal!
It's Pierre!
Over here.
Easy, Pierre, easy. You're safe.
You're in the house.
- Carcagne! It was the carcagne! I saw her!
- What's a carcagne, Pierre?
- Come on, tell us about it.
- It's the devil in the storm.
With the face of the wolf and the body of the woman with wings.
- Bigger than I can tell.
- You probably saw an eagle, Pierre.
- Oh, no! It was la carcagne! La carcagne!
- Oh, I remember now.
I read it somewhere. It's a superstition, a legend that the French Canadians started and came across the border with.
Yeah. It vaguely rings a small bell with me, too.
It was probably just the lightning and the storm, Pierre.
- You just imagined the whole thing.
- No! No! I saw la carcagne!
Here. Take another swallow of this.
Come in.
What's the matter with Pierre?
He thinks he saw something weird in the sky.
I saw her. I saw la carcagne!
- He can't get it out of his head.
- Yeah, I know.
I live up this way myself.
There's a lot of the old folks around here believe that yarn.
But this is the first time I ever heard anybody claim he really saw the old witch.
- You come to take us to the airport?
- Yeah. Car outside.
- Oh, I hate to leave him like this.
- Oh, don't worry, ma'am.
Joe here will stay with him.
But we'd better hurry.
- They're holding that plane for you.
- Come on, Sally.
They're holding a plane for us, we'd better get with it.
We haven't even thanked him.
I'm afraid the social amenities won't mean very much to a man in Pierre's condition.
He's right, ma'am. You'd never get through, the way he's scared stiff right now.
Scared? So he thought he saw a big bird.
Why should that paralyze him so with fright?
- Didn't he tell you?
- Tell us what?
The legend. According to the story they tell, if you see this big bird, it's a sign that you're going to die real soon.
- That plane's waiting. We'd better go.
- Okay, Sergeant.
"The kiss you take is better than you give."
A many-faceted creature, this Mr. MacAfee.
First engineer and pilot and now lover and poet.
Oh, the line of poetry was from Shakespeare.
I know, but where did that impulse come from?
- Left field, maybe.
- I like baseball.
Or maybe just sitting next to a pretty girl.
That's enough in itself, sometimes.
Even sitting next to Mademoiselle Mathematician?
Or should we stick to the baseball reference?
There are figures and there are figures.
Inescapable logic, corny but true.
You almost overwhelm me.
Almost?
Well, let's finish the job.
Look at that moon.
Speaking of baseball and left field, somebody warned me that you make up your own rules.
- Whoever said that's no friend of mine.
- But he's a friend of mine.
Sabotage!
Oh, much too dramatic.
Let's stick to baseball and say instead,
- "Out, trying to steal second."
- Back to the bush leagues, finished.
A quitter. I knew it. No fight, no spirit.
Of course, the umpire could always reverse her decision.
No, no short cuts. Must follow the pattern.
First the minor leagues, and then the major leagues.
- I stick to the rules, Mitch. Sorry about that.
- Why be sorry? You can always...
Pattern.
- Pattern.
- What's the matter?
Pattern. I need one of your maps.
The orthographic projection, the pole to equator.
- Give it to me, will you?
- Well, sure.
I think I have it here somewhere.
Ah. Here it is.
What's that?
Open your map.
Now, where I sighted the UFO.
Where the search plane disappeared.
The Transpolar airliner.
Our plane at Pierre's.
And finally the Navy patrol plane.
- Well, you were muttering about a pattern.
- Well? See it?
Well, no. No straight line, no curve, nothing.
Wait.
A pattern.
A perfect pattern in time and distance.
Each incident, each cross, later than the one before.
Each one further out in the spiral from the center.
You mean, something in the air flew a pattern like that?
Yeah. Something I saw.
Something that flew over and past me in the air.
Well, it would have to be traveling at incredible speed to cover
- all the distance in the time involved.
- Yeah, it would.
Something that seemingly destroyed four planes and barely missed you the first time.
Yes.
Something like your flying battleship?
- Okay, forget the whole thing.
- Oh, well, now, Mitch. Be reasonable.
Why that pattern, just to knock down a few scattered planes?
And what? A meteorite? Impossible!
A guided missile?
Well, that would stop with the first plane it hit.
And who would launch it?
And for what reason?
No, Mitch, coincidence, yes. But pattern, no.
Here's your map.
Well, you are a child. Mitch, think!
If there was anything flying this kind of a pattern, why, it would be tracked by dozens of different radars.
And none of them spotted a thing, so what?
Well, maybe it was Pierre's carcagne,
"with the head of a wolf and the body of a woman, with wings as big as I can tell!"
- There's no need to be sarcastic.
- Look, would you two mind being quiet so the rest of us can sleep? Thank you.
Sorry. Maybe I was being childish.
Mitch MacAfee, flying Sherlock Holmes.
I think you did make better sense with your poetry than you did with your detective deductions.
- I know another poem.
- Oh?
"Be plain in dress and sober in your diet.
"In short, my deary, kiss me, and be quiet."
Date, the 18th of the month.
Sky clear, light clouds. Visibility unlimited.
Time, 0815 hours.
A CAB plane flies toward the scene of the previous day's crash involving Mitchell MacAfee.
On board, four members of the
Civil Aeronautics Board investigating team.
And a pilot.
Time, 0816 hours.
Another significant moment in history.
Once more a frantic pilot radios in a report on a UFO. A bird.
A bird as big as a battleship, circling and preparing to attack the CAB plane.
Stop leaning on the buzzer. I'm coming.
Mr. MacAfee?
- Or a reasonable facsimile thereof.
- General Buskirk's respects, sir.
- He'd like to see you right away.
- Oh, have a heart, Captain.
I got in late last night.
I just about fell asleep when you woke me.
- Sorry, sir, the General says it's urgent.
- So is my sleep!
My orders are to bring you to the General's office at once.
Even if I have to take you into protective custody.
Okay, Captain, don't get in a tizzy. You keep your shirt on, I'll go get my pants on.
My sighting. The search plane, the Transpolar airliner, our plane at Pierre's and the Navy patrol plane. Too much, and it fits too well, to be just coincidence.
There have been two more since the Navy plane.
A private plane here last night and a CAB plane with four passengers and a pilot here.
All following your theoretical pattern smack dab on the nose.
No radar tracks, I suppose?
As usual, since you started this crazy nightmare, nothing.
Except about the planes.
Did the pilots report anything?
Not a word from the pilot of the private plane.
But the CAB pilot reported a UFO.
- Did he say what it was?
- Yes. A bird.
A bird as big as a battleship circled and attacked the plane.
- Believe me, Mr. MacAfee, this is no joke.
- Oh, no.
That plane was completely destroyed.
And all five men on board seem to have completely disappeared from the face of the Earth.
Now, you're an electronics expert.
Could there have been anything that big up in the sky and not be picked up by radar?
Impossible! But I saw it myself.
Yes. Three men reported they saw something and two of them are now dead.
Well, that makes me chief cook and bottle washer in a one-man bird watcher's society.
Mr. MacAfee, this is vitally important.
Did you get a good look at it?
No, it was just a blur as it went past.
How I wish I'd had a camera with me.
Camera! General Buskirk, before I went out on this radar assignment with Mitch, I was doing Earth curvature calibration work.
Well, how does that help us on this?
Well, we used film strips photographed from inside test rockets and from fixed cameras and observation balloons.
- Sally, maybe you've got it!
- If those balloons are still up, there's a bare possibility they photographed this thing, whatever it is.
General Edward Considine, Pentagon.
Priority, fast!
Something's coming up now.
Kill it!
This film and all the information pertaining to it and the bird are classified as top secret.
Notify all agencies and personnel involved who have handled the project or will handle it.
Yes, sir.
- Johnson!
- Yes, sir?
Put the entire command on combat readiness right away.
Notify the Pentagon and have them tell
General Considine I'm on my way.
Yes, sir.
Colonel Tyler at the field? Line one, please.
Oh, Nate. Nate. Buskirk here.
Warm up my plane.
And file a flight plan for me to National, Washington. Right.
We're coming now.
Two extra passengers. Okay.
You two are coming with me to Washington.
Miss Caldwell. Mr. MacAfee.
It's some sort of bird all right.
There's no question of that.
Miss Caldwell, is it possible that this bird has been flying in blind spot areas
- that our radar can't pick up?
- No, sir. I checked carefully.
At least ten different radar sites should have tracked it.
Mr. MacAfee, could speed or altitude affect the ability of our radar to pick it up?
No. There's no scientific or any other kind of reason in the world why our radars don't track it.
They just don't. Period.
Then what you're saying in essence, is that black is white and two and two make six.
Look, General, I didn't invent this flying nightmare, I just saw it and reported it.
The General understands, Mr. MacAfee.
He's not blaming you for anything.
Relax, man.
Relax? When do we stop relaxing and start doing something?
Good sense isn't confined exclusively to civilians, Mr. MacAfee.
We know how to take care of ourselves and the country.
Easy, Van, easy. Take it easy.
There's a general air alert on this very minute, son.
Hundreds of planes from every command are combing the skies, searching for this overgrown buzzard.
- We'll find it all right. Never fear.
- And when we do, General. Then what?
Yes? Good! Where?
Okay, this is official now.
Pass 'em the word to shoot it down.
No questions, no games, no stalling.
Just shoot it down. Yes.
Get me a tape on all air-to-ground and air-to-air channels, and pipe it through a hotline to me here.
One of our squadrons just spotted it.
I've ordered them to attack and shoot it down.
Our planes are armed with cannon, machine guns and rockets.
This should be the end of the big bird who was there but wasn't.
You'll be able to hear it as it happens.
This is Easy Baker squadron leader.
- Target below and to the side. See it?
- Yow! Holy Toledo!
I've seen some mighty big chicken hawks back on the farm, but, man, this baby takes the cake.
Honest to pete, I'll never call my mother-in-law an old crow again.
This is Easy Baker squadron leader.
Peel off on signal.
One pass and then you're on your own.
This is Easy Baker squadron leader.
It's got one of the planes.
I must be losing my marbles.
This isn't for real.
Bullets, rockets, nothing touches it.
Easy Baker squadron leader.
Charlie hit the silk when the bird got his plane and now it...
Charlie's gone. Chute and all.
It don't make sense.
Like we're hitting a battleship with a slingshot.
It's going after another plane. Look out!
Easy Baker squadron leader.
Mission's a washout.
We're going to head for... No!
It's coming after me! No! No!
Machine guns, cannons, rockets, nothing touched it.
- Those pilots...
- We'll find it, all right, never fear.
The end of the big bird.
You were right, Miss Caldwell, when we find it, what then?
Phase two off standby, operational.
- Notify the Joint Chiefs.
- Yes, sir.
It doesn't make sense.
It's just a bird, a big bird.
- Guns. Cannons. Rockets. It's just a bird.
- Sure, it's just a bird.
Ten million dollars worth of radar can't track it.
Enough firepower to wipe out a regiment can't even slow it down.
Sure, it's just a bird.
Well, what are we going to do, just sit around here and weep?
- Oh, climb off our backs, MacAfee.
- We're not crying, MacAfee, and we're not running away.
But it's hard to come up with answers when you don't even know what the question is.
Being flip doesn't help any.
I'm not criticizing either of you or the Air Force or those guys who just died trying to shoot that thing down.
I'm not being flip, and I'm not wisecracking.
I'm just scared. We all are, I guess.
So let's face that and then try and do something about that bird.
- Any suggestions, MacAfee?
- Sure, electronic spitballs!
- Van.
- Close, General, close.
Only not electronic spitballs, atomic spitballs.
- Yes?
- Phase two operational.
- All units alerted and ready.
- Good.
Call for you.
Dr. Karol Noymann at the research lab.
I'll take it on two.
This is General Considine, Dr. Noymann.
Say that again? Good, good.
You stay where you are. I'll be right over.
Research lab's been kept right up to date.
They've been working on the wreckage of that CAB plane
- and the plane that you two cracked up in.
- Find anything new, Ed?
They think they've figured out what that bird is and where it came from.
About those atomic spitballs.
An hour before your plane landed in Washington,
I ordered guided missiles with atomic warheads made ready for every launching site in the country where the fallout pattern makes it safe to explode them.
The order you heard me give to make phase two operational was an order to fire those missiles the moment that bird is spotted anywhere!
- General, I'm sorry, I guess I...
- Don't apologize, son, I admire your spunk.
And you keep climbing on our backs whenever we've messed up any of the detail.
- Van?
- Sorry, Mac.
- I guess we're all trying to do our best.
- You two better come along.
You're up to your ears in this thing anyway.
Come on, let's go.
The atom is the basic building block of all matter.
The atom this model represents is like every atom as we know it.
The nucleus is positive.
The electrons are all negative.
In this respect, it has been maintained that all atoms are alike.
But this is wrong, all wrong!
According to the law of electrodynamics, all nature is symmetrical.
It is in balance. And if there is matter, then there must also be antimatter, a symmetrical mirror image.
Now here we have a positive nucleus, negative electrons.
In the reverse, we must obviously have a negative nucleus with positive electrons.
Science has proved that this is so, not in this Earth nor in this solar system but somewhere in the universe there are stars, planets, whole galaxies made up of antimatter.
Well, do you mean to say, Doctor, that this bird is made of antimatter?
That it's reversed, inside out, a mirror image, as you call it?
Just a minute, General.
Doctor, it's been proven that antimatter exists, but it's also been proven that whenever it comes in contact with ordinary matter, they annihilate one another, blow up.
Why didn't the bird explode when it was hit, or when it touched something?
Well, you are both right and wrong.
The bird itself is not antimatter.
But the bird unquestionably radiates some sort of force, an energy screen, some invisible barrier.
And that energy screen is antimatter.
Guns, cannons, rockets, no wonder nothing touched it.
Stuff hit the antimatter screen and blew up before it could get close.
- Mitch, this explains the failure of the radar.
- Yeah.
No reflecting surface. The radar waves wouldn't bounce off, they'd slide around.
So with no echo, no tracks.
Dr. Noymann, a couple of questions.
All this isn't just guesswork on your part?
No, it is not guesswork, General.
Evidently, this bird is able to open that antimatter screen to use its beak, its claws, its wings as destructive weapons.
Now, here is part of the wreckage.
Examination by a staff of scientists has told us the whole incredible story.
It has been checked and double-checked.
- Is there anything else, General?
- Yes, Doctor.
Where did this bird come from?
Here is a piece of feather from the bird, found in the wreckage.
At least, we call it a feather, we don't know what it is.
Only what it looks like.
It has defied chemical analysis, the electroscope, every conceivable test.
It contains no substance known on the Earth today, no element recognizable by man.
- Finding that out was expensive.
- Well, how so?
We had several of these feathers, this is the only piece left.
As a last resort, we tried testing them in electronic analyzers.
Look.
That bird is extraterrestrial.
It comes from outer space, from some godforsaken antimatter galaxy millions and millions of light years from the Earth.
No other explanation is possible.
Van will fly you two back to New York.
I'd appreciate it if you'd hold yourselves in readiness and, of course, you understand that everything that you've seen and heard is classified.
My command is ready, Ed, and waiting at the end of a hotline. Just phone.
Just phone, Van? Well, I'll need help, all the help I can get. We all will.
The only trouble is that the last time I talked to a chaplain, there wasn't any telephone line to the one and only place where we can get the kind of help that we need.
General Considine.
This is an emergency.
Get me the Secretary of Defense.
Up to now, only one man had seen the bird and lived.
Among those who knew of it, its existence was a closely guarded secret.
But even as arrangements were made for an emergency meeting of the President, the Cabinet, the National Defense Board, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, even then, the bird revealed itself to the world at large and complacency quickly turned to panic.
Panic, terror, and horror.
No corner of the Earth was spared the terror of looking up into God's blue sky and seeing, not peace and security, but the feathered nightmare on wings.
Oh, come in.
Well, I worked half the night running your figures through the calculating machine.
- Hope the results are what you want.
- Good. Thanks.
Mitch?
Oh. Thank you.
Oh, really. For two days and a night now, ever since we got back from Washington, you've had your nose buried in all those papers, figuring, calculating.
- Mitch, you've got to stop to sleep and eat.
- I've been busy.
What you're working on have anything to do with the bird?
To destroy the bird?
Well, will it work, Mitch?
I don't know.
I honestly haven't the faintest, foggiest idea.
It's one of those cock-eyed concepts that you pull down out of cloud eight somewhere in sheer desperation.
Said anything about this to General Buskirk or General Considine?
And have them gently remind me to stay in my own backyard? No, thanks.
What's the difference? There's only a million-to-one chance it will work.
It's just something to do instead of this deadly sitting around and waiting.
Mitch, I've been thinking about the bird, too.
Yeah, you and everybody else in the world.
Ever stop to wonder why the bird came here?
Could it have been for food?
I mean, does the bird eat, in the sense that we understand eating?
Well, Dr. Noymann says that it absorbs energy from the things it destroys, including humans, sort of a molecular osmosis.
Could it have come here to rest?
- If it did, it sure as shooting isn't.
- Right.
So far as we knew the bird just kept flying around the Earth, always flying, never stopping.
Well, that's what bothered me, so I called General Buskirk.
Mitch, remember Pierre Broussard, at the farm?
Yeah, him and his la carcagne, or whatever he thought he saw.
It just goes to prove what they always say, truth is stranger than fiction.
Well, this was no fiction.
Pierre did see something, he saw the bird.
12,000 feet up at night in a storm?
- No. The bird came down to Earth.
- But you just finished saying...
Well, General Buskirk told me they found the mark of a giant claw on a field next to Pierre Broussard's farm, and I know why.
The bird came here to build a nest.
Nest.
Eggs.
More birds.
It's got to be true.
There's just no other reason for it.
General Buskirk. MacAfee calling.
This is urgent.
Baby, gather up those papers for me, will you please? Take these, too.
General Buskirk? MacAfee.
Now, please don't argue or ask for reasons.
I'll explain later. It's desperately important.
I need a fast plane, and then a helicopter.
Please, please, General, believe me.
I know what I'm doing.
Yeah, at Broussard's place, the farm.
Right. We're leaving right now.
Sally's with me. Yes.
We'll go straight to the airport.
We interrupt this program for an important announcement.
Ladies and gentlemen, speaking from Washington,
Lieutenant General Considine,
United States Air Force.
We are faced with a crisis, a crisis for which all the nations of the world, in unprecedented cooperative action, have found as yet no solution.
Until we do, we shall not rest.
We have tried every weapon in the arsenals of the mightiest armies on Earth.
They have proven worse than useless.
Atomic, hydrogen weapons, capable of wiping cities, countries off the face of the Earth, are completely ineffective against this creature from the skies.
Two days ago, all aircraft were grounded.
Deprived of its source of food or energy, however the bird survives, the bird began a series of attacks on the ground, in a fantastic orgy of destruction never before seen.
Nothing has been safe from attack by the bird, cattle, horses, fields, homes, trains, all manner of transportation.
It has become obvious that the bird is attracted by movement.
Accordingly, your government and all the governments of the world have declared a state of emergency and instituted martial law.
In addition to grounding all aircraft, all surface transportation, cars, trucks, buses, trains, ships at sea, all such traffic must be halted at once.
The movement of food and essential supplies will be handled by the armed forces.
Blackout conditions will be observed from sunset to dawn every night until further notice.
Movement of any sort on the streets or highways during the daylight hours must be held to an absolute minimum and only where it has been authorized as essential.
You have just heard General Considine speaking from Washington. Stay tuned...
Mitch!
Well, that plane is waiting for us.
We've gotta get up to Pierre's place.
There it is!
We'd better land before that decides to do it again.
The guns.
Two Weatherby.378 Magnums, they'll stop anything.
Anything, Mitch?
Well, anything but the bird, but we're looking for eggs.
Without antimatter energy screens, you hope.
- La carcagne?
- No, Pepe, not la carcagne, a million times worse.
Let's get out of here.
It looks like the nest, all right.
No sign of any egg.
Well, it might be somewhere down in there.
Only way to find out is to go down there and look.
La carcagne!
An egg!
You shoot gun, make the big noise.
La carcagne come and we all die.
We have to get that egg, Pierre, it's our only chance.
Pierre, he not stay.
Pierre! Come back!
I'm from Montana.
Pierre and his la carcagne.
- He was right. Seeing it did mean his death.
- Yeah.
I'll alert Washington.
They'll get out search parties.
Everywhere in the world, wherever the bird has been sighted, just on the off chance that there might be more eggs, so they can be found and destroyed.
That much we can do.
Well, let's get back to the city.
With that bird around, it's too dangerous to fly.
We'll leave the chopper and take Pierre's car.
He won't be needing it.
- Come on, Brad, make this thing go.
- Yeah, come on.
Let's get some speed on this.
Oh, man, he ain't moving at all.
Come on! Come on!
- Some maniac driving with lights and fast.
- Maybe he didn't hear the proclamation.
I'll flag him down when he tries to pass.
- Hey, daddy-o, get that tin can off the road.
- Come on, man.
- Hey, man, who's afraid of the big bad bird?
- Turn out your lights! Get off the road!
Don't worry about us, we've got salt for its tail.
Hey, watch out for that salt, don't get it in the carbs!
Come on, let's go!
Crazy kids!
They don't know what they're doing!
- Dig you later, 'gator.
- Hey, daddy-o, don't call us, we'll call you.
- They boy is badly hurt, but he's alive.
- The girl's unconscious.
There's a town up ahead with a hospital.
We'll take them there.
You and I are going in to Washington tonight.
I'll bring the car over here for the kids.
Miss Caldwell, MacAfee, I'm a busy man.
I hope this isn't some sort of crackpot wild goose chase.
You and me both, General.
Well, it's your dime, boy.
What is it you want to show me?
- How to shoot the bird out of the sky.
- Some new type of weapon?
No, with regular guns, bullets and bombs.
Anything you want.
MacAfee, I told you that I haven't got time...
Listen, General. This idea of mine may prove to be as phony as a $3 bill,
- but I still think it's worth a listen.
- Well, go ahead.
Now I don't care whether that bird came from outer space or Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, it's still made of flesh and blood of some sort and vulnerable to bullets and bombs.
If you can get past that antimatter energy screen.
Right. That's exactly what I think, what I hope I've figured out how to do.
I've just invested a dime of my own, boy.
Keep talking.
Now, this is a blow-up I had made of a bubble chamber photograph.
The chamber was bombarded with high-speed particles.
Result, a photograph of a trail made by what is known as a mu meson.
But notice this hole, this gap right here.
This gap is one of the most exciting and significant recent discoveries in all science.
You probably know about it, Dr. Noymann.
Yes, yes. The formation of a temporary mesic atom, the mu meson with a hydrogen nucleus.
Right. But mu mesons are 210 times heavier than electrons.
Which means that in a mesic atom, the electrons revolve around a nucleus at just a small fraction of the ordinary distance in a normal atom.
I know you don't understand all this,
General, but stick with me.
Now, the mesic atom is extremely small, small enough to sift through the electron defenses of the ordinary atom
- and fuse with its nuclei.
- Atoms of matter or antimatter.
Right, Doc! Now if this thing of mine works and we can get close, real close, and bombard that bird's antimatter energy shield with a stream of mesic atoms,
I think we can destroy that shield.
The bird would be defenseless then except for beak, claws and wings.
You could hit it with everything but the kitchen sink.
We've got kitchen sinks to spare, son.
Do you think you can do it?
Well, I've kicked around some ideas.
I'm not sure they'll work,
- but it's certainly worth a try.
- Well, what do you need?
This lab, Dr. Noymann and his staff,
Sally here to help with the math, and a blank check for supplies and equipment.
It was yours before you finished asking for it.
MacAfee, time is running out.
Today, tomorrow, a week from now maybe...
Besides I'd hate to lose that dime
I've got invested in you. Good luck, son.
- Well, anybody ready for some work?
- Work or maybe some magic.
- What we need is a miracle!
- Here it is. A miracle.
A dime's worth of miracle.
This weapon would have to create mesic atoms, not as rare and isolated laboratory phenomena, but in tremendous quantities, eject them through some aiming and propelling device so they could travel indefinite distances through the air to arrive with sufficient speed and in sufficient numbers to bombard and destroy an antimatter shield.
Truly a miracle of science.
Especially since the scientific total life expectancy for a mesic atom, up to now, measured in laboratories, had been one two-millionth of a second.
Failure.
Failure...
...after failure...
...after failure.
And while a handful of dedicated people struggled to achieve the impossible, panic spread to all corners of the Earth.
Panic and nightmare terror.
Easy.
Mitch.
Easy, son, easy. You did your best.
We can't have you killing the patient trying to cure the disease, now, can we?
A magnificent effort, Mitch, magnificent.
It's unfortunate it was doomed to failure from the start.
Oh, great.
Now if somebody will just deliver the eulogy, the deceased can be safely laid away to rest.
What's the matter with you, are you all nuts or something?
Mitch, are you all right?
Sally, how long has it been since the explosion?
About an hour and a half, two hours, I guess.
- Oh, we're wasting time.
- Easy, son, easy.
- Is that bird still in the air?
- Why, yes.
- You still want to shoot it down?
- Why, yes, yes, sure.
Well, then, for pete's sake, let's get with it.
General Buskirk has had a plane waiting in that field outside of New York ever since we started the experiments.
We've got to get the equipment installed on that plane.
Mitch, the apparatus didn't work.
The experiments failed.
Mitch, please lie down in bed.
You were hurt in that explosion.
Of course, you don't know.
The explosion was no accident.
I did it on purpose.
I used the mesic atom projector.
What?
Well, sure. We had the basic wiring all fouled up.
It was a simple matter of adjusting the polarity on the main condenser terminals.
I figured it out while you two were asleep, set it up right and tried it.
- Now wait a minute, MacAfee.
- Mitch!
Wait a minute. Are you trying to tell me that that machine of yours works?
- Sure.
- What kind of plane has
- Buskirk got waiting for you?
- An old, stripped-down B-25.
Good. Maneuverability instead of speed.
Yeah, the whole operation may depend on being able to turn on a dime.
Well, then what in blazes are we waiting for?
Well, that's what I've been talking about for 10 minutes.
Get me my pants, will you, General?
Oh, Sally, get out of here.
We've installed the ejector nozzle in the tail of the plane,
- pointing to the back.
- Rewiring the plane's generating system, plus an added bank of batteries, should give us more than enough power.
Now, weight's a problem. How many people will you need to operate this machine?
The doctor, myself and a calculator.
Have you got someone coming up here for Sally to brief in a hurry?
- I don't want her on that plane.
- He's coming in from the city now.
One question. Why do you aim that gimmick from the tail and not from the nose?
Too dangerous in the nose. We might fly into our own mesic bombardment
- and destroy the plane.
- Chances are, once we locate the bird and we're up in the air, the bird will chase us.
- And if it doesn't?
- We'll attract its attention somehow.
- Sandwiches and coffee.
- Thank you.
The bird's been sighted heading for New York City.
- How long will it take you to finish?
- An hour and a half or two.
- Still got to connect the thing up.
- No, that's too long.
We've got to take off in 15 minutes.
You'll have to finish in the air.
What about the calculator to replace Sally?
Sorry, MacAfee, we haven't got any time for that.
- General...
- Van, you'll fly, I'll back-stop you.
- Clear the field for a takeoff.
- Right.
Well, what are we waiting for?
Get the rest of your stuff on board.
There it is now, attacking the United Nations building.
Make a pass at it.
The bird's after us, chasing us.
How are you doing?
- Ready in a minute.
- Well, fast, boy, fast.
For God's sake, hurry, man!
It's catching up with us fast.
Got it! Close those circuits.
It's all yours, General.
Steady.
Steady.
Fire rockets.
We got it.
- Now, now, don't get nasty my little friends, your bumping's not gonna hurt you one bit.
Just relax and sleep.
Sleep, sleep, sleep and in the morning you'll find yourselves in your new home.
Eh, my pets?
Good morning, Doc, what you got there?
Alvin, I found some new friends.
Listen.
Wasps?
You better be careful, they can sting a man to death.
Don't worry, we understand each other.
They know who their friend is.
They can tell.
Yeah, but they know when you ain't too.
Ah, nonsense.
If you knew about wasps what I know, you'd have no fear of them my boy.
No fear.
- Hey you, give us a hand here!
Hello there, Mr. Barker.
Surprised to see you out here in the field, sir.
How are things running at the front office?
Smooth as honey, Renfro.
I see here you turned in over a thousand pounds of orange blossom honey and 400 of beeswax last month, Renfro, congratulations, you've made the top of the list again.
Why, thank you sir.
- Holiday Honey needs your kinda man, Renfro.
You stay with it and I can see a bright future for you with the company.
Well I do try to do my best, Mr. Barker.
I try to take my inspiration from the bees, always busy, busy, busy.
Yes.
Now what about this fellow, Dr. Zinthrop?
Zinthrop?
Boy, there's a nut, him and his bees.
You know it wouldn't surprise me someday to see him flapping his arms, taking off after some queen bee with the rest of the drones.
- Mm-hmm, well he's paid to do research on royal jelly.
Haven't had a progress report from him in a month.
- Hmm, well, he has a little workshop up there, back of the orange grove, keeps a few colonies.
- I suppose I better go up there and take a look.
Hey you!
Where's this fellow Zinthrop?
- Oh, he's up where the extractor is, up there!
Hey, hey, this isn't a honey bee.
These are wasps.
Wasps!
Who's responsible for this?
Most likely Dr. Zinthrop, sir.
I told you he was a crackpot.
Zinthrop, huh?
Zinthrop.
Zinthrop!
Zinthrop!
Now look here, Zinthrop, what's all this nonsense about wasps?
I'm so glad you dropped in, Mr. Barker.
Mr. Barker, I'm on the verge of a great discovery.
Discovery, what do you mean?
- Well, sir, I almost perfected a new method of extracting royal jelly from the queen wasp.
- According to my figures you're better at extracting funds from the company.
Now look here, Zinthrop, over $1,000 last month for miscellaneous.
Yes, yes, I know, but Mr. Barker, let me just show you something.
Just let me show you something.
Already I've learned to slow the process of aging.
Soon,
I shall be able to reverse it entirely.
What are you getting at, Zinthrop?
Look, what do you see?
I see a big dog and a little dog.
Let's say an old dog and a young dog.
All right, so what?
But they're exactly the same age.
You see, the little one
Greta has been given regular injections of my compound from the queen wasp.
Just like I told ya, Mr. Barker.
- Now look here, Zinthrop,
I understand about science and progress and all that but you were attained to extract queen bee royal jelly.
Now it's a health food, a cosmetic.
It's not a miracle drug or an elixir of youth, that sort of thing is impossible.
- Oh, but Mr. Barker-
- Zinthrop,
I'm sorry, Zinthrop, but
I'm gonna have to let you go.
You just don't seem to be one of the team.
You understand.
Good luck, I'm sure you'll fit in somewhere.
Fit in.
Somewhere.
Oh, now, now, don't worry, my friends.
We shall find a home somehow.
Somewhere.
Oh but you sound impatient.
I know, it's your babies, huh?
They're hungry and they must be fed.
Now, how would you like a nice, juicy little caterpillar?
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
There.
Now you must eat and be strong because, well, a lot of work to do together.
Yes sir.
A lot of work.
As you can see, gentlemen, sales for the last fiscal quarter have dropped.
14 and one half percent.
There's not been a corresponding drop in our competitor's sales.
I trust one of you gentlemen has a satisfactory explanation for this decline.
Not one little suggestion, gentlemen?
We'll start with you, Thompson.
As Public Relations Manager, no doubt you have some faint glimmering of what's happening to Starlin Products.
Well, Thompson?
- Well, you see, I-
- I had no idea you were such an excellent public speaker, Thompson.
- Oh, I'm sorry Miss
Starlin, I guess I'm not feeling very well this morning.
I'm sorry you aren't.
- I think I can tell you why Starlin Products are falling off so badly, Miss Starlin.
We're listening, Lane.
Where would you put the responsibility for this decline?
On you, Miss Starlin.
I imagine you have arguments to support that contention?
- We've all been looking at it for the past 20 minutes.
The most convincing argument is right on that graph.
May I show you?
Thank you.
Now right here in April is when Starlin's sales started falling off.
Very clever of you, Lane.
- Would you mind waiting until I finish, Miss Starlin?
- That's enough, Lane.
- Relax, Willis.
My apologies for the interruption, go on.
Thank you.
Now as I said, sales began to fall in April.
But the reason for the fall was back here in February.
Starlin Products have always been thought of as something of a modern miracle in the cosmetics trade.
A firm built to a multi-million-dollar-a-year business on the strength and appeal of one person, Janice Starlin.
From the beginning right through until February of this year, only one woman's face was used to advertise those products.
Your face, Miss Starlin.
The public have come to accept you as a, as a symbol.
Now, after 16 years, they see a different face, they don't trust it.
They feel cheated.
The simple fact is that Starlin Cosmetics should have Janice Starlin's picture advertising them.
Well that's about all I've got to say.
And a darn good job of saying it, too.
I agree.
- Lane makes a lot of sense on that score, Miss Starlin.
I think I've had enough flattery for one morning, gentlemen.
It was a very convincing argument, Lane.
- There's a Mr.
Zinthrop to see Miss Starlin.
- There's only one small factor you've overlooked.
Not even Janice Starlin can remain a glamour girl forever.
Miss Starlin.
Yes, Mary?
There's a Mr. Zinthrop in reception, he says he has an appointment.
Thank you.
Well, this has been a very informative get together, that'll be all for now.
Oh, Arthur?
- Yes, Miss Starlin?
- I'd like to see you in my office, please.
Sure, Miss Starlin.
Take it easy, hot shot.
Something on your mind, Miss Starlin?
- You've done some work on royal jelly, haven't you?
A little.
- Are there any real therapeutic values in it?
Oh, I'd say so.
Course a lot depends on each individual's reaction to the stuff.
What do you mean?
- Just that no two people react in precisely the same way.
One man's meat's another man's poison.
Oh.
But you think royal jelly can be beneficial in some cases?
Queen bees set a lot of store by it.
- I'll accept that as an affirmative answer.
Supposing a more powerful form of royal jelly could be obtained, from the queen wasp for example.
I mean, do you suppose that might have some rejuvenating effect on a human being?
- I'd stay away from wasps if I were you, Miss Starlin.
Socially the queen wasp is on a level with the black widow spider.
They're both carnivorous, they paralyze their victims and then take their time devouring them alive.
They kill their mates in the same way too.
Strictly a one-sided romance.
Well, I'm not exactly interested in the love life of the queen wasp.
I want your opinion on the possibilities of using enzyme extracts from royal wasp jelly, commercially.
- Well, if you want an honest opinion, Miss Starlin-
Of course I want an honest opinion.
Then my advice is forget about it.
Thank you, Arthur.
Any time, Miss Starlin.
- Have Mr. Zinthrop come in.
- Yes, Miss Starlin.
You can go in now, sir.
- Oh.
'Bout time.
Janice Starlin Enterprises.
Miss Starlin?
Yes, how do you do?
I'm afraid I won't be able to give you much time,
Mr. Zinthrop.
- But it is I who give you the time, Miss Starlin.
Oh yes, plenty of time I give you, 10, maybe 15 years I give you.
- I want you to understand one thing very clearly,
Mr. Zinthrop.
I expect absolute proof of what you claimed in your letter, tangible proof, not words.
- Such proof you shall get, Madam, and more.
But I think I better show you in the laboratory, yes?
All right.
Come along.
Look.
They look terrible.
Why don't you put them out of their misery?
- Madam, you asked for proof, please be kind enough to look at the proof you asked for.
May I proceed?
Thank you.
Come, come, come little one.
In a few minutes, Madam, we shall see a miracle you shall not believe.
Oh, no tricks, you may look if you like, I have no tricks.
Well, don't look at me, I'm not changing.
I don't believe it, it's not possible.
I see you do not believe one animal, so I bring two.
I show you again, yes?
Yes, I must be sure.
Yes, Madam.
There.
Well, Miss Starlin, does my secret have interest for you, yes?
What are your terms, Mr. Zinthrop?
First, I must have a laboratory equipped with everything I need for my research.
If we're successful, well, I ask for a little percentage.
But I must get full credit for my discovery, that is most important to me.
I'll have Gordon draw up the contracts.
Oh, contracts, contracts I do not need, you give me your word, good enough for me.
You amaze me.
Frankly, when I received your letter I thought you were just another eccentric.
But there was always a chance you might not be.
Then you walk in here and show me nothing short of a miracle.
Two miracles.
And you say that you'll accept my word that I won't cheat you.
You won't.
I know you're a good woman, even if you do not like other people to know it.
However, my formula may not be good for human beings,
I have not tested yet.
You will, on me.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, there might be danger.
Those are my terms, Mr. Zinthrop.
Janice Starlin will be your next guinea pig.
Very well.
Though it may take a little time to prepare a sufficient extract, a week, maybe more.
- I'll make whatever arrangements you may need for your equipment.
Thank you, Madam.
Now I see how you built all this.
- I'm very close to losing it, Mr. Zinthrop.
Maybe working together we can save
Janice Starlin Enterprises, maybe even make it bigger than ever before.
Yes.
Oh, yes.
- I'm sure the next three months we will see a rise in Starlin sales that will surpass anything we've dared imagine.
Mr. Zinthrop...
Is working on the final stages of a development that will revolutionize the cosmetics industry.
He's to have a free hand in his experiments and will be answerable to no one but myself.
At the moment I cannot divulge the nature of Mr. Zinthrop's experiments but I can assure you it will bring world-wide recognition to Janice Starlin Enterprises.
- I dunno, this Zinthrop must be the granddaddy of all confidence men to have taken a gal like Starlin.
Now why doesn't somebody wise her up?
Like you, for instance?
Bill, what makes you think Zinthrop really isn't on the level?
After all, we don't even know what he's working on, it could be very legitimate.
You're as bad as she is.
Oh, women.
Men.
Every time you're stuck for an answer you always come up with, "Women."
You're not getting out of this one so easily.
I'd like to know why you think Zinthrop really hasn't got something.
- Well you can call it male intuition if you like.
It's just that there's something about this whole business that doesn't smell right.
The private laboratory, the secret experiments,
Zinthrop himself.
The only thing that's missing is a genie with a lamp.
You better leave the intuition to me.
Come on, I'll let you buy me dinner.
Buy you dinner?
What's happened to your sporting blood?
I thought we were gonna toss for the check.
Oh no, you won the last three times.
- All right, look, I'll make a deal with you.
Dinner is on me if you promise to keep an eye on what goes on in there.
- Oh, what do you want me to do, read her mail and send you messages in secret code?
You could do worse.
Oh no, Mr. Cooper, not you too.
- I've been trying to tell bright eyes here that I think Zinthrop is a phony and a confidence man.
- If I were sure of that
I wouldn't be worried.
I think he's a lot more dangerous.
A quack.
Well, I don't follow you, Coop.
Well, a confidence man would just be interested in your money.
The only damage they can do is to your pocket book.
A quack can be fatal.
- So I says to him, I says, "Listen Irving,
"I'm getting sick of this
TV every night, I mean,
"you know, we can do the same thing in a night club."
Well, almost.
Good morning, Janice Starlin Enterprises.
I got two words for ya, drop dead.
Twice.
Irving?
Calls me to tell me Dr. Cyclops is on channel nine tonight.
What a crust.
He's seen it twice already.
Good morning.
Is Miss Starlin in her office now?
Miss Starlin's in conference.
Would you like to speak to her secretary?
Oh, no, no, no, just say to Miss Starlin
I should like to see her when she has time, huh?
Yes sir.
Was there something else, Mr. Zinthrop?
No, no, no, no, goodbye.
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
What a character, a regular two-eyed Dr. Cyclops.
Even the bow.
- "Good morning, may I see Miss Zarlin, please?"
He's a real weirdy.
Wonder what his game is.
- Who cares.
You know, Morton thinks he's a crackpot,
I heard him telling Cooper so.
Old bug eyes really has the execs worried.
About what?
That's just it, they don't know.
Oh.
So anyway, back to Irving.
- Good morning, Miss
Starlin, good morning.
- Good morning, I couldn't get away any sooner, is it important?
- Miss Starlin, do you remember the big cat
I showed you last week, no?
What about it?
Well, I want you to look at him, come.
No.
Quite a difference, yes?
Why, it's incredible!
The same mark.
Same cat.
- You're young again, can you realize what that means?
You're a kitten again.
Your whole life to live over.
How does it feel?
- I think perhaps you'll be able to find out for yourself, Miss Starlin.
Today...
Today will be your first injection.
Come.
Sit down, please.
- Mr. Gleason, of accounting, on line three.
What is it, Gleason?
I sent you a memo.
Mr. Zinthrop has carte Blanche to order anything he requires.
It is no concern of yours, Gleason.
Make out a check for the full amount.
Sue?
Mary.
Can I talk to Mr. Lane a minute, please?
Bill?
Hey, listen, Gleason just got a bill for $2,300.
Zinthrop.
Enzyme extracts.
Yes, yes, yes, we are making progress, there's great improvement in the tissue.
Why is it taking so long?
It's the third week.
You forget, my dear, there's more to you than a little kitten, no?
Besides, there's a difference in metabolism.
Why not increase the dosage?
Wouldn't that step up the process?
Patience, my dear, patience.
We must tread lightly, with care, your arm, please.
There.
You know, I've been experimenting with a concentrated solution of the enzymes, oh a great deal more powerful than the solution
I've been using in your injection.
Oh?
Yes.
And I think, I think it will be better for lotions, as an emollient lotion it'll make estrogenic creams and all such products old fashioned.
My dear, Starlin will be world famous, bringing you to millions.
If you're right, Zinthrop, there are going to be a few red faces in my advertising department.
But I am right, why your own mirror will tell you that I am right.
Why, you look at least five years younger than you looked three weeks ago.
I know.
- Will you let me talk to Bill a minute, Sue?
Thanks.
Bill, I think I've got it.
Yeah, I'm a nervous wreck.
At lunch, at lunch.
You'll have to translate for me, Coop,
I'm not very good at that technical stuff.
Pseudo-technical.
Our Mr. Zinthrop's a very capable confidence man from what I read in this letter.
He claims he can stimulate the processes of rejuvenation through the use of enzymes extracted from wasps.
Oh, for...
- Well, what are you two
Sherlocks going to do about it?
Right now I don't know.
- Frankly I'm getting tired of the whole business.
That woman's so intent on holding back time she's ready to fall for the first phony line she hears.
Wasps.
Bill.
Face the facts, Mary, Janice Starlin has built her whole life on youth and beauty.
Now that she's losing them she's scared to death.
Right now she's on cloud nine with that quack Zinthrop but I'd hate to be around when she comes back down to Earth.
Well maybe we can let her down easy.
I think we owe her that much.
Yeah.
What are we gonna do?
We can't just let Zinthrop build up her hopes and then knock the props out from under her.
How can he do such a terrible thing?
Poor Jan.
There must be something we can do before it's too late.
He's got a mighty convincing argument.
Very impressive to the layman.
10 to one he's got a record just as impressive.
There are ways to find out.
The answer might be right here in our hands.
Heads.
I'm gonna keep this letter for a day or two.
- Wait a minute, suppose she finds out it's gone,
I'm the only one with access to that desk, she'll know I took it.
That's a chance you have to take, Mary.
I think we can be pretty sure that Coop knows what he's doing, honey.
Well come on, young lovers.
What is it, Maureen?
It is you, Miss Starlin?
Of course it's me.
Who did you think it was?
You look so different.
Finish your nails.
Maureen.
Hmm?
I think your phone is ringing.
Oh, yes, Miss Starlin.
Good morning, Janice Starlin Enterprises.
Gentlemen, Janice Starlin Enterprises is about to start on the most wide-spread publicity campaign in the history of the cosmetic industry.
Our slogan will be, "Return to youth with Janice Starlin."
When Mr. Zinthrop arrives, there will be a press interview and all questions regarding the rejuvenation process will be referred to him.
That'll be all for now, gentlemen.
- It's amazing.
- Why, it's wonderful.
- Absolutely amazing.
- You look marvelous.
- I said that will be all for now, gentlemen.
Good morning.
Oh not you, Mary, wait a moment, please.
Yes, Miss Starlin?
Mary, isn't it wonderful?
It's a miracle, a wonderful, incredible miracle!
We were so worried about you, we really thought you were in danger.
We even went to plotting how to rescue you from Mr. Zinthrop.
It all seems so silly, it seems ridiculous.
Oh Mary,
Mary, how old do I look?
Tell me, how old?
How old do I look?
Tell me!
How old?
Maybe 22?
That's how old I was when I started
Janice Starlin Enterprises.
Do you realize what that means?
I'm back where I started, 18 years ago, with what it took 18 years to accomplish.
It's like a dream.
- 30 years ago a bunch of quacks were treating people with monkey glands.
Seemed to work for a while.
Then the deterioration set in.
That's awful.
Do you think that will happen to Jan?
I don't know.
If I could just get inside of his lab and run a breakdown on what he's using.
Mr. Zinthrop!
Mr. Zinthrop?
Mr. Zinthrop?
I want you to find him, Mr. Hellman,
I don't care what it costs.
We'll find him all right, sooner or later we find them all.
Time is vital, Mr. Hellman.
Every hour he's gone, it means more than you can possibly imagine.
- Well, you haven't given me very much to go on.
No home address, no former employer, no phone, this is just like starting from scratch.
Mr. Zinthrop wasn't a, a conventional employee.
He didn't go through regular personnel.
Uh-huh.
You say he came here about a month ago, well how did he come here, Miss Starlin?
He just didn't walk in off the street, did he?
The letter.
Right here in my drawer.
- Maybe one of the other drawers?
So that's what she meant?
What who meant?
Miss Starlin?
The letter's been taken and you think you know who took it, is that right?
My secretary, Miss Dennison.
You got her address handy?
Her phone number.
- It might be better if
I busted in on her cold.
This way she'll have a chance to prepare a story.
I know what I'm doing.
All right.
Mary?
Janice Starlin.
- Before I went to lunch
I made a duplicate copy of Mr. Zinthrop's letter.
I was going to take that one to Bill and Mr. Cooper at first but then I thought that the original would be better.
Have you got the copy?
Yes, it's in my desk.
Get that copy, Miss Dennison.
Uh-huh, 946 West 73rd Street, Manhattan.
Yeah, that's right, get right on it, Jerry and check back with me as soon as you can.
Yeah?
Oh?
You're sure he's our boy?
Uh-huh.
Is he?
Central emergency.
Mm-hmm.
Right.
Well, it looks like we've got him.
There's a John Doe down at central emergency, auto accident.
There's no identification on him but he was wearing a lab smock and fills
Zinthrop's description.
- Mary, get my coat and
Lane, get a cab downstairs.
Is he badly hurt?
- Head injury, general contusion to the body.
- He's had a severe injury and there's definite brain damage, just how much we can't tell as yet.
How long before you'll know?
It's hard to say, Miss Starlin.
- Who's the best man for this kind of injury?
Well, there's several top specialists.
Get the best,
I'll take full responsibility for the expenses.
Yes, Miss Starlin.
I don't know, Arthur.
I think it best we wait.
- It's been three days since the accident, Jan, and no sign of improvement, he's still in a coma.
You heard what the doctor said.
He may never regain consciousness.
And even if he does, who knows how badly his brain has been damaged.
Well,
I'll give it another 48 hours.
If he doesn't regain consciousness by then, you can take over the laboratory, Arthur.
Janice.
It's my decision.
- It's incredible, right in front of our noses.
He can't have used it all.
I could run a qualitative analysis.
- Confounded thing, always goes on the fritz right in the middle of a good program.
- I want this to be the biggest advertising campaign in the history of cosmetic advertising.
Every newspaper and magazine in the country will be flooded with our new slogan,
"Return to youth with Janice Starlin."
Excuse me, Miss Starlin.
What is it, Thompson?
- I think we should be a little conservative,
Miss Starlin, cosmetics are one thing, medications another, we're liable to run into trouble.
Yes.
All advertising copy will be cleared through your office.
It's a touchy business, you know?
Max is right, Miss Starlin.
- You don't have to second the motion, Lane.
I want one thing understood very clearly now, gentlemen.
Janice Starlin Enterprises is going to bring the most fantastically sellable product ever developed by modern cosmetics to the public.
And I don't intend to be restricted by timidity on the part of my own staff, is that clear?
Are you all right, Miss Starlin?
It's just a little headache, Mary.
I'm fine.
Can I get you something?
I'm all right, I'm all right, thank you.
I have some Aspirin in my purse.
It's all right, Mary.
Well, that'll be all for now, gentlemen.
Hi.
Hi, sweetie.
- Gee, I sure hope they give the girls working at Starlin first crack at that new stuff.
Imagine being 18 again.
- I guess if it can take
15 years off Starlin, it can take 10 off you.
What do you mean 10?
- Face it honey, this is
Maureen you're talking to.
Yeah?
Well if I were you I'd take a double dose then maybe Irving wouldn't watch television so much.
So who says he looks at it?
I can't imagine what else he does.
Three guesses.
- Say, did Cooper come in yet?
- Uh-uh.
Missed a board meeting this morning,
I bet Starlin's having a fit.
He should worry.
Uh-oh, see you later.
Bye, honey.
Hi pretty puss.
You know where
Miss Starlin's office is?
Suite number one.
- I. Di da, the Duchess of Flatbush herself.
- How'd you like to have this phone wrapped around your ear?
Wise guy.
That's more like it, sister.
Suite number one.
Thank you.
Miss Starlin.
Oh, what is it, Mary?
Is there anything I can do?
Yes, is Mr. Zinthrop's room ready?
- Uh-huh, the nurse is fixing the emergency equipment now and the ambulance is due any minute.
Be sure to let me know when it arrives.
Oh, Mary, please, before you go, could you see if you could work that thing?
Oh, sure.
I've seen lots of these.
Oh, simple enough.
That'll be all, Mary, thank you.
All right.
- We've had a room especially made over for you,
Mr. Zinthrop and Mrs. Warren has a room adjoining yours so there'll be someone near you at all times.
Thank you, thank you.
- When you're feeling better, Mr. Zinthrop, there are a few things I'd like to discuss with you.
Good, good.
We'll do everything we can to make you comfortable, Mr. Zinthrop.
I'm going to spend the nights here in my office so if anything develops, I'll be on hand.
Thank you.
Thank you, Miss Starlin.
Only there's something
I must tell you, something important.
But, important but...
I cannot remember.
I'm sure it can wait.
Right now the main thing is to get you back to health.
Take good care of him, Mrs. Warren.
Yes, Miss Starlin.
Sure is funny about old Coop.
- He misses one day of work and you're ready to call missing persons.
- Well, he's a pretty conscientious guy, honey, if he felt sick or something he'd have called in.
Relax, he'll probably be in bright and chipper in the morning.
Oh, am I interrupting something?
- Oh, we were just having a little coffee class,
Miss Starlin, we were talking about Mr. Cooper.
What about Mr. Cooper?
- Well, about his missing the meeting this morning.
Nobody's been able to reach him all day.
I wouldn't worry about that,
Mr. Cooper's been here a long time.
Probably feels he's entitled to take a day for himself now and then.
- That's what I've been trying to tell Mr. Lane.
- Oh, by the way, Miss
Starlin, how is Mr. Zinthrop?
Oh, fine.
In a few days we'll start the layouts for the campaign.
I'm ready when you are, boss.
Look those over.
Hey, Bill.
Hmm?
- Don't go getting any ideas about the boss.
- Me? Don't be silly,
I just want her to know that I'm an eager member of the team.
Still, she is looking a lot younger these days, isn't she?
You think Zinthrop would give you any of those treatments?
Break the watch or something.
Guarantee on this too.
What's that?
Lie back now, you just had a bad dream.
Lie down now, go to sleep.
This horrible sound.
Like a nightmare.
Just a bad dream.
Lie down.
Just a dream.
- Tell Mr. Green that personnel is his responsibility.
I have other things to think about than worrying whether the night watchman walked off the job.
Well that's just it, Miss Starlin,
Mr. Green feels that the watchman never left the building.
His lunch pail and his raincoat are still in the basement.
- I don't want to hear anything more about it, Mary.
All right, Miss Starlin.
We'll use these.
Fine.
She swears she heard a scream from one of the other floors.
Zinthrop heard it too but she convinced him he was having a bad dream.
Oh, maybe they both were.
It's not funny any more, Mary, there's something going on in that building.
And I'm gonna find out what it is.
How?
- Have a look around
Cooper's lab, for one thing.
After that I,
I don't know.
Hold it steady.
Bill, this is crazy.
We could really get in trouble.
I won't tire him, Mrs. Warren but it is important.
- All right, Miss Starlin,
I'll be in my room.
Zinthrop,
Zinthrop, you've got to help me.
Something's happening.
Something's happening to me, I can't control it.
There's something I must remember but
I can't.
Try to think.
The wasp enzymes, the extracts you were experimenting with before the accident.
Try to think!
I can't
Well this is Zinthrop's notebook, Mary.
Notes on his experiments with Jan.
Well how did Cooper get hold of it?
I don't know.
If only Coop would show up.
Mary, look.
It's Mr. Cooper's pipe.
Don't you get it?
He'd sooner go out without his pants than leave that pipe behind.
He's still somewhere in the building,
I'd bet a year's salary on it.
- If he is-
- He's dead.
And the night watchman.
- There's only enough left for one more injection.
One more.
You've got to make more, Zinthrop.
Help me, Zinthrop!
Please, leave, my head, oh my head.
Zinthrop, help me!
Help me!
Is he asleep?
I don't know.
Bill, don't touch him.
- If anybody knows what's behind all this, it's him.
Mr. Zinthrop?
Bill.
Look it.
- Well, her coat, purse and everything else is still in there.
She wouldn't go out without her purse.
- Bill, let's get out of here, I don't like it.
The cat...
The cat...
Must warn her.
Mr. Zinthrop!
Who are you?
- Now there's nothing to be alarmed about, Mr. Zinthrop,
I'm Bill Lane and this is Miss Dennison,
Miss Starlin's secretary.
Miss Starlin, the cat.
What about a cat?
Must warn her.
The injections, must not take any more injections.
Is Miss Starlin in danger?
Terrible danger.
I must-
- Take it easy, Mr. Zinthrop, you're still pretty weak.
Mary, see if you can get Jan on the phone.
There's no answer.
- Oh, Miss Starlin?
- Is that you, Mary?
- Where are you?
- We're in the building.
We're in Mr. Zinthrop's room.
Something's happened down here-
Here, let me talk to her.
Hello, Miss Starlin, this is Lane.
- Why are you and Mary still in the building?
It's after 10.
- I must help,
I'm responsible.
- Don't let him get up, Mary.
I must help.
I must-
- I can't explain now, Miss Starlin.
I must go.
- Hang on to him.
- I must help.
You must not hold me back.
Don't worry, Mr. Zinthrop, we won't let anything happen to Miss Starlin.
Hello, hello, Miss Starlin.
What's going on down there?
Stay in your office, I'll be right up.
Keep an eye on Zinthrop, honey, I'm going upstairs.
No, no, no!
The insect, the insect!
Take it easy, Mr. Zinthrop.
You do not understand, Miss Starlin, she's in danger, I must warn.
- Look, I'll have to stay here, you go for Jan.
Okay.
When you get up there, call the police, you can't get outside on this phone.
All right, all right, I'll hurry.
Not the police, not the police.
Miss Starlin!
Miss Starlin, it's me, Mary!
Miss Starlin, please, open the door!
- What is it, Mary?
- Miss Starlin, please!
Will you please call the police?
What for?
Look, I don't have time to, never mind.
Mary!
I'm sorry I had to do that.
There's no time for hysteria.
Now what is this?
- The enzymes, the enzymes, they're going crazy.
Sure, Mr. Zinthrop, you just relax and take it easy, everything'll be all right, we'll take care of those whatever you call those-
- You do not understand, you do not understand, that girl, you shouldn't have sent her upstairs.
She's in danger, you must stop her before it is too late.
- Okay.
As soon as the cops get here, we'll take-
Oh, you fool, you fool.
Miss Starlin will kill her and tear her body to shreds.
Miss Starlin kill Mary?
- Miss Starlin is not a human being any longer.
The enzymes have changed her.
She will destroy the girl as an evil wasp would destroy her enemies.
And then devour the remains.
- Then Bill found Mr. Zinthrop's notebook in Cooper's desk.
No, no, there's no mistake, we've got to call the police now.
- Now, Mary, you're just getting a little excited.
Now who could possibly want to hurt Mr. Coop...
I don't know.
But it's not only Mr. Cooper.
What about...
I told you, we're too late.
Mary!
Mary!
Wait, I'll go with you.
I can't wait, I'm gonna take the stairs.
Oh look.
Laboratory, she's going to the laboratory.
Going up the stairs.
Mary!
Mary, Mary!
Help!
Get away from her!
Mary.
Oh, Mary.
NARRATOR: In the beginning, God created the heaven and the Earth.
And the Earth was without form, and void.
This is the planet Earth, newly born, and cooling rapidly from a temperature of 6,000 degrees to a few hundred in less than five billion years.
The heat rises, meets the atmosphere, the clouds form, and rain pours down upon the hardening surface for countless centuries.
The restless seas rise, find boundaries, are contained.
Now, in their warm depths, the miracle of life begins.
In infinite variety, living things appear, and change, and reach the land, leaving a record of their coming, of their struggle to survive, and of their eventual end.
The record of life is written on the land, where 15 million years later, in the upper reaches of the Amazon, man is still trying to read it.
MAN: Tomas! Tomas! Tomas!
Please.
LUIS: What that is,
Dr. Maia?
I don't know, Luis.
I have never seen anything like this before.
It's important?
Yes, I think it is, very important.
We will take one more picture.
Then we will dig it out.
Luis, I'm going to Morajo
Bay, to the institute.
You two are to wait here in the camp.
You be gone long?
Long enough to find out what this is and get help in digging out the rest of the skeleton.
I want a man in camp at all times.
Luis, you will be in charge.
I'm sure you scared all the fish away.
At the depths he's working, Doctor, the fish won't hear a thing, believe me.
Ah. There he is.
See him?
What's he waiting for?
He's getting used to the change in pressure.
KAY: Ah. Here he comes.
DAVID: Hi.
David. David, I have a surprise for you.
Yeah?
Carl Maia!
It isn't you!
What's left of me,
Dr. David Reed.
The last I heard of you, you were up in the Amazon someplace digging for old skeletons and things.
And you two were doing research for an aquarium in California.
What are you doing in Brazil?
On, we've been guests at your institute for a month now.
We're looking for specimens of lungfish.
David, you still don't look like an ichthyologist. (ALL CHUCKLING)
A geologist's point of view.
He expected a loveable old professor with a beard.
I didn't expect him to look like he did when he was a student of mine.
Give me a shoulder, Kay.
Are you two married yet?
No. No, David says we're together all the time anyway, might as well save expenses.
Did you ever hear of two living as cheaply as one?
That's what I keep telling him, Carl.
I'm waiting for Williams to give her that raise.
Then she can afford me.
Oh!
Come on. Let's go ashore. it's good to see you again, Carl.
Show him what brought you back, Carl.
I found this in a limestone deposit dating back to the Devonian age.
I was hoping you experts on marine life could make some identification.
DAVID: I've never seen anything like this.
KAY: Look at the webbing between the fingers, David.
DAVID: Yeah.
Maybe we'll know more about it after
I find the rest of the skeleton.
Boy, I'd sure like to be with you when you do.
So would I.
What about your boss?
You think he would be interested?
Williams? (CHUCKLES)
If there's a chance of any publicity, just try and keep him away.
Now, be fair, David.
Publicity brings endowments.
And without money, there isn't any research.
That's right, if it weren't for Dr.
Williams going on digging up the dough, we wouldn't be down here.
Where is this thing?
At the institute.
DR. MAIA: Here it is, gentlemen.
Exactly as I found it.
It's amazing. it's incredible!
MARK: Could it possibly belong to a Pleistocene man?
Chances are much greater that that hand belonged to an amphibian, Mark, one that spent a great deal of time in the water.
Well, then now do you account for the structure of the fingers, obviously for land use?
What do you think, Dr. Matos?
We can be sure of one thing.
Whatever it was, it was very powerful.
You say you have hopes of finding the rest of the fossil?
As soon as I get a suitable expedition together.
Well, why don't we make up the expedition?
We're here now, and after all, it does come under the heading of our work, doesn't it, David?
It certainly does.
More and more, we're learning the meaning and the value of marine research.
Look, look over here.
This lungfish, the bridge between fish and the land animal.
How many thousands of ways nature tried to get life out of the sea and onto the land.
This one failed.
He hasn't changed in millions of years.
But here, here we have a clue to an answer.
Someday, spaceships will be traveling from Earth to other planets.
How are human beings going to survive on those planets?
The atmosphere will be different, the pressures will be different.
By studying these and other species, we add to our knowledge of how life evolved, how it adapted itself to this world.
With that knowledge, perhaps we can teach men to adapt themselves to some new world of the future.
Nice speech, David, but there's still a practical side to it.
If I sound brash and more like a banker than a scientist, try to remember that it takes money to run an institute like ours.
A find of any real importance can be of great financial value to us also.
Certainly, your board couldnâ€™t disapprove.
It certainly couldn't.
Dr. Maia, you've got yourself an expedition.
Good, we'll leave for
Manaus in the morning.
From there, we'll take a boat up river.
Tomas!
No,no,no! it's so hot.
It'll get hotter.
Couldn't Maia find anything better than this barge?
Well, I guess not many ships want to go up river as far as we're going.
We didn't exactly expect to get the Ile de France either.
You don't like the Rita?
What the doctor meant, Lucas...
I know what the doctor means.
But what for I need a sweet-smelling boat to carry fish on this crazy river?
How do you like the best cabin on the Rita, Miss Lawrence?
I love it!
Good.
Well, now we have a lab, such as it is.
Let's hope we have some use for it.
I'll be disappointed if we don't.
Assuming, of course, that Dr.
Maia's facts are well-founded.
Dr. Maia's a scientist, not a fortuneteller
How can he guarantee anything?
Well, it seems to me, a scientist has need for both vision and confidence.
I didn't mean it as any personal criticism, Doctor.
It's just that I always look forward to success.
And I thought the
Mississippi was something.
It's a winding brook compared to the Amazon.
This is exactly as it was
150 million years ago when it was part of the Devonian era.
Sounds like the beginning of the world.
It is.
Even the animals here grow as they did in Devonian forests.
The anteater is a giant with the strength of a bear.
The centipede grows to be a foot long.
The Amazonian rat is as big as a sheep.
That's incredible.
But it's true.
Don't forget our catfish.
They grow to be nine feet long, and killers!
Like everything in this jungle, all killers.
Dr. Maia says we're gonna drop anchor in a couple of hours.
Maybe you'd better get some rest.
Again, Lucas.
We want to make sure my boys hear us at camp.
When we anchor, we'll take a rowboat.
Luis!
Tomas!
Luis!
Luis! Tomas!
Strange they'd be gone.
Could they have gone hunting?
I gave strict orders for one man to remain in camp at all times.
Come on!
Stay here, Kay.
Wait till we find out what's going on.
Luis!
What could have happened?
I don't understand it.
Thereâ€™s only one explanation.
The country is full of wild animals.
I think maybe jaguar.
Jaguar's claws, they rip like this.
Where's Kay? Kay?
Kay!
What happened?
There's been trouble.
Let's go back on board, Kay.
A world-shaking find, all right.
(GROANS) Eight days.
All we dig up are enough stones to pave a road.
Had enough, Mark, or do we keep on digging?
I'll tell you when
I've had enough.
We've failed, that's all people will understand.
Carl, have you any idea what this tributary empties into?
My boys used to tell me there's a lagoon at the end of it.
What are you getting at?
I was just thinking.
It could be that at some time in the past, part of this bank broke away and fell into the river here.
Over hundreds of years, perhaps over thousands of years, the current would break it up.
If there is a dead end to this tributary, that's where we'll find the fragments.
We might even find the rest of your fossil.
It's a theory.
What's wrong with that?
Even if David's theory is correct, the chances of finding anything are remote.
Science is always taking the remote chance.
Why don't we try it?
We might still turn failure into success.
Well, there's just one thing, Mark, going into unexplored territory with a woman.
I'm not afraid, David, and we've come this far.
Yeah, I know, but I keep remembering what happened to Carl's men.
That doesn't sound like the dedicated scientist talking, David.
Dedication doesn't mean risking the lives of others.
I've always found Kay was able to take care of herself.
But we know nothing about this lagoon.
I can tell you something about this place.
My boys call it the "Black
Lagoon," a paradise.
(CHUCKLES) Only, they say nobody has ever come back to prove it.
We'll do it.
(GASPS) om
Oh, David.
(CHUCKLES) I didn't mean to startle you.
I don't know what made me do that.
That howling out there doesn't help any.
Those are guariba monkeys.
You sorry now that we came?
You don't understand the species very well, Doctor.
Well, give me time.
I thought I was doing well, considering that we've only been together for six months.
How much time do you think you'll need?
From where I'm sitting,
I'd say a lifetime.
That's the right answer.
We may not even have a lifetime.
In that case...
You mean this thing really works?
Oh, yes.
It's a very positive weapon, the spear gun, Lucas, and easy to use.
All you do is aim it and squeeze.
What are you going to shoot at?
Does it make any difference?
DAVID: Can you take it any slower?
Ease her off.
Little bit, not too much.
Give me that boat hook.
I think we can just make it on this side.
It's tight over here.
It's impossible.
But I, Lucas, will do it.
DAVID: The Black Lagoon.
KAY: The beautiful lagoon.
DR. THOMPSON: Another world.
Take her out a little farther, then we'll get the net over the side.
You expect to catch a fish?
We might as well find out what species are here.
We're not interested in what species of fish are here.
We're after the rest of that fossil, remember?
I need some rocks from the bottom of the lagoon for a test.
But we just got here.
Why waste time?
If any parts of the wall that contained the fossil were ever deposited in here, the rock test should prove it.
Yeah.
I'll get the Aqua-Lungs.
You be careful, David.
We don't know what's down there.
I hope you're afraid for me too, Kay.
Of course, Mark.
A little faster.
Come on! Faster!
All right, let her down.
All the way.
Come on, down, down.
All the way.
All right. Hold it!
Here we go.
We got the net down, David.
Good.
This is crazy kind of fishing.
Who eats rocks?
I do, in a manner of speaking.
I crush them and they tell me things.
Now, you be careful.
What these rocks tell you, anyway?
How old they are.
It's called the uranium-lead test.
What do you wanna know that for?
So we can match them against the sample in which the fossil was found.
KAY: Hey, they're up!
How long they have to wait there?
It depends on how far down they went.
Well, how was it down there, huh?
Oh, fine.
Come on, I'll help you off with this equipment.
MARK: Good.
DAVID: Carl,
I got your samples.
Good.
Let me have them.
Here they are.
Thank you, David.
And this is something for you.
Oh! Well, thank you.
They're very pretty.
Let's test them right away.
DR. MAIA: Will you help me, Doctor?
DR. THOMPSON: Be glad to.
DR. MAIA Thank you.
Come on, David.
You can play house later.
David. About Mark.
Well, what about him?
Try to understand.
I've been trying.
Somebody ought to tell him his ambition is showing.
It won't do any good, I know.
Long before you came to work with us, I tried.
But there's this to say for him, he's produced some important findings.
He's also taken credit for some important findings.
Well, coming below?
No. No, I'll wait up here.
Hey, what was it like down there?
Like another world.
I'd like to see it.
Crazy kind of fishing, for rocks! (CHUCKLING)
Miss Lawrence!
Miss Lawrence!
You're too far out,
Miss Lawrence!
Hey,Zee!
Go start the motor!
Chico! Pull up the anchor!
DAVID: Kay, what are you doing out there?
Come on back!
LUCAS: You take it easy.
We get you!
Drop the anchor.
KAY: Thanks, Lucas.
Kay, that wasn't a very smart thing to do.
KAY; But wonderful!
What was that?
Something's in the net.
Pull up your net!
Come on. Hurry up!
Take it away!
DAVID: Pull it up!
Pull it up!
Is it fouled against the side?
DAVID: Pull it up!
The boom's cracking!
Slack off your winch!
Slack off!
He can't hear you!
Hey, what kind of fish do this?
Who says it was a fish?
The net could've hooked on to some underwater rock.
Wait a minute.
It was no rock that left this in the net.
It's amazing!
I just finished the rock analysis.
And you were right, David.
Some of the limestone deposit where I found the fossil is on the bottom of this lagoon.
Lucas, put that over the side for me, will you?
Whatever the species might be, if you let it alone, it won't bother you.
Maybe. But if you're wrong, this harpoon will correct any mistakes.
Mark, we're out for photographs for study, not trophies.
This thing alive and in its natural habitat, it's valuable to us.
Why settle for a photo when we can get the real thing?
You don't sound like a scientist.
You sound like some big-game hunter out for the kill.
We may not be back home, David, but you're still working for me.
You didn't wait long enough before coming up.
Why'd you shoot?
You weren't attacked!
You sound as though I put the harpoon through you.
What makes you think we're supposed to play tag with the thing, whatever it is?
I tell you, we can learn more from it if it's alive!
Please, what is it that you found?
I don't know what you'd call it.
It sounds incredible, but it appeared to be human.
I tell you, if it's what I think I saw, it's the greatest find yet.
Nothing compares to it.
I've got the proof here in my lens.
LUCAS: Many years ago, I hear this legend on the river.
A very old native tell me of a man who live underwater, but she was crazy.
"Crazy Goole," everybody called her.
The unknown always seems unbelievable, Lucas.
One accepts these things as legend and lets it go at that, but to actually believe that there exists something like a human being that can live underwater...
This is no legend, as you'll soon see for yourself.
What about the kamongo?
Science hadn't heard about it until a few years ago.
The kamongo lived way back in the Devonian age.
Interesting that the fossil I found was out of the same period.
The kamongo was a fish that breathed air.
What does that prove?
KAY: Nothing.
Except that the kamongo fish, which has lungs, exists today, right here in the Amazon.
It hasn't changed in all these millions of years.
That doesn't prove the possibility of a gillman.
If the evolution of that species could reach a dead end way back then and still survive, why couldn't another?
DR. THOMPSON: Where is he?
I was sure I had him in my finder.
For a merman, he takes a fine picture.
This wasn't imagination, Doctor.
I'm sorry, David.
What proof do we have if we never find it again?
If you hadn't stopped me, we could have taken it!
Dead or alive, what's the difference?
Ahhh!
What happened?
ZEE: Chico!
What happened?
Chico!
Chico is gone.
My brother was dragged down into the water by a demon!
Come on, everybody, look around, quick!
Chico!
Demon, eh?
It's no more far-fetched than your gillman.
There are many strange legends in the Amazon.
Even I, Lucas, have heard the legend of a man-fish.
DR. MAIA: Over here! Quickly!
LOOK!
All right, Lucas, start your pumps.
Now all we have to do is catch him.
Don't waste your time.
You'll never take it alive.
I want to try, Mark.
All right, David, we can always do it my way.
If we could just be sure of its reaction.
Do you suppose it remembers
Mark's attack and seeks revenge?
I'll welcome it.
You'll get your wish, all right.
I've got a hunch this creature remembers the past and more.
I don't want him creeping up on us while we're sleeping.
I know a way to bring him up now.
Rotenone.
It's a drug which natives make from roots for catching fish in still waters.
Sometimes I catch fish that way.
I show you. Look.
Excuse.
One taste of the poison water, and poof!
The paralyzed fish floats up to the top with a big hangover.
Come on! Let's try it.
Still no sign.
Nothing but the little ones so far.
Could be he's dead from the wound.
Then again, maybe the rotenone isn't going deep enough.
Maybe we should fix the rotenone to sink deeper down.
Yeah. Anything is worth a try.
What was that?
I don't know.
Come on. Come on.
You talking to me, Mark, or something out there?
Both, David.
They won't believe it back home, none of them.
I wouldn't have believed it myself.
Sitting out here, waiting for some monster to appear.
That's why we've got to take him.
Why won't they believe, Mark?
Because we deal with known quantities, with knowledge we've accumulated up to now.
We've just begun to learn about the water and its secrets, just as we've only touched on outer space.
We don't entirely rule out the possibility that there might be some form of life on another planet.
Then why not some entirely different form of life in a world we already know is inhabited by millions of living creatures?
We must have the proof!
In the water!
The lantern frightened him off.
No.
There he is! it's foolish to go after him.
But he's drugged.
No, I'd wait anyway.
If he has gills, he may suffocate
How long does the effect last?
An hour, maybe two.
But for that thing, who can tell?
Carl, follow me in a rowboat.
Bring a net.
Wait, I'm going along with you.
I keep you covered.
That's where he went under.
I'm going to take a look.
Wait here.
Take it easy!
He went through here, come on.
Zee! oh, David! David!
We got him!
We got him!
Don't kill him!
What happened?
Give me the net.
How is he?
He's dead.
DAVID:
That's the last one.
All right.
Will he live?
I don't know.
It depends on whether he can survive both the rotenone and being out of the water so long.
You sound as if you feel sorry for him.
Why? He could have killed you just as easily.
But he didn't.
It doesn't make any difference now.
The point is, he won't do any more killing.
Any time you're ready,
Lucas, we can start back.
Mark, we're not finished here yet.
We've got to make a study of that grotto, we've got to collect photographs, data...
I've got all the proof I need.
Get going, Lucas.
Mark, we're not going anywhere until we've finished our work.
All right, David, if it will make you feel any better.
Oh, Doctor, would you mind staying behind and keep an eye on our prize?
KAY: Don't be long, David.
You better get some rest.
Hi.
I thought I'd come up and get some air.
What do you suppose is taking them so long?
David's very thorough.
But shouldn't you be resting, Kay?
I couldn't sleep.
Listen to the sounds.
DR. THOMPSON: Hunting calls, mostly.
Animals out for the kill.
Some of them are cries of fear, like people who whistle in the dark.
I'm not exactly blind.
You're worried about what's happened between Mark and David.
But once you admit the simple fact that you're in love, which you have, then it becomes a good idea to be the scientist about it.
It's not as easy as that.
Why not?
If it weren't for Mark Williams,
I wouldn't have my work or even a job.
It's true, he helped you through your training and gave you a job.
But he needed you just as much as you needed him.
You're oversimplifying.
You've more than repaid him many times over.
Why, a good part of his present position at the institute is due to your valuable research.
And another thing...
Get away, Kay!
Go on, get back! Go on!
Dr. Thompson!
How is he?
If infection doesn't set in, he may pull through.
The fool! It wouldn't have happened if he hadn't been careless.
There's no one to blame.
Four men dead so far.
If he dies, what a useless waste of experience and ability.
Nobody meant it to happen, David.
Mark, I'm for getting out of this lagoon just as fast as we can.
Without taking what we came for?
We didn't come here to fight with monsters.
We're not equipped for it.
We came here to find fossils.
Later, later, we can come back with a properly equipped expedition.
Be reasonable.
Reasonable?
What else could I expect?
But you, Carl, it means as much to you.
You're driving yourself too hard, and the rest of us along with you.
We're staying until we get him.
Or until somebody else gets killed.
No, we're not.
Lucas, we're getting out of here just as fast as we can.
Okay.
I'll make the decisions around here.
But you are wrong,
Mr. Williams.
On the water, the captain makes the decisions.
We will do as you say.
You'll listen to me.
You wish to say something, mister, huh?
Dr. Maia, will you please to pull up the anchor?
I will start the engine.
DR. MAIA Look Out!
There's something here.
Look out!
Look out!
Hold back. Hold back.
There's something here.
Hold back! Hold back!
LUCAS: I tell you, nothing was there when we came in.
It was put there to keep us from getting out.
By mm.
I check below for damage.
I go aft and keep watch.
You better stay with Thompson.
It's our last chance,
David, to get the proof.
Look, you can see for yourself, it's still here.
We're trapped and fighting for our lives, and you're worried about whether people will believe us.
Ls all right down below.
Go in the cabin and lock the door.
No, no. Stay here with us. You're safer.
Lucas.
Lucas, start your winch. Eh?
Go on, go on.
Start your winch.
Up an inch!
Hold it!
All right, give me some slack.
A little more.
Whoa!
Take it away!
Easy. A little more. Whoa.
Take it away!
Take it up.
More, more.
Hold it.
All right, take it away!
UP, up!
She must have slipped.
We'll just have to try it again.
How, David?
I'll have to use the Aqua-Lung.
I'm going to help him.
I'm going in with you.
Mark, all we're interested in right now is getting the entrance to this lagoon cleared.
I'll be the bait for him.
Oh, Mark, get out of my way.
Let it come to me, David.
It'll give you a chance to get at him.
You're crazy.
Crazy to want to bring back the biggest find anyone has ever made?
You don't know what this can mean, David, to all of us.
Mark, you're not going with me!
I am.
Thank you, Carl.
Lucas, stand by the winch.
Carl, stand by that cable.
Oh!
It's the only way.
We've got to clear this inlet.
Hey, that fellow down there, you think maybe he's a mosquito you can shoo away?
We've got to take that chance.
Oh, sure!
Whats an expedition without two martyrs, at least?
Kay, Kay, I'm doing the only thing we can do.
If we all just sit here, we'll all end up as Mark did.
Wait a minute!
Something you just said, about his not being a mosquito.
Maybe we won't have to fight him on his own terms after all.
How much rotenone have we got left?
Not enough.
Enough to use in a spray gun?
What?
Oh! You mean, to kill like a mosquito!
It worked for us before.
And it took plenty of time.
All we want is to make him groggy.
Keep him away long enough so I can get a cable around that tree.
What do we use for the spray gun?
One of the air bottles.
A solution of rotenone released under pressure, that ought to do the trick.
Some trick!
Come on!
Lucas, you stand guard.
YES.
Can you hurry it up?
I shoot him, but I miss!
He'll be back. Hurry.
Give me a hand!
KAY: David!
LUCAS: Si!
Did you see him?
He's there, all right.
Give me a hand with this equipment.
I'll help you.
I got the cable around the log.
Good.
Get ready with that winch.
All right.
I'll get her started.
Give it a little slack.
Ready to take her back.
Ready.
Uncleat that line for me, will you?
All right, take her back.
Take it back.
Hard astern.
She's coming.
Back. Back.
She's coming. Back.
Keep going. Hard astern.
Whoa! We're clear.
Stand by to pull her up with the winch.
Pull her in.
DAVID: That's it.
Whoa!
I'll go down and unfasten it.
Give me slack!
Good.
More slack.
Slack. That's enough.
LUCAS: That's good.
Now you're getting it.
Just slip it back through the ring.
Hurry, David!
DAVID: I've almost got it.
He got her.
No, don't shoot, don't shoot!
You might hit Kay.
Give me a hand.
Lucas, get to the beach entrance.
Kay!
DAVID: Kay!
Kay?
Kay. Kay, darling.
Oh, David. David!
Get back, Kay.
Get back!
DAVID: No, no more.
Let him go.
No.
Hi, Eddie.
- Hiya, Scotty.
Cold enough for you?
- Well, I'm only faintly alive. It's 25 below.
You know everybody?
- We haven't met.
McPherson.
- Hi.
Ned Scott, Capt. Hendry.
Scotty just got in today.
Hi, care to join us?
Wait till I count my fingers.
I may have lost one.
Scotty's a warm-weather man. We met at Accra. Quite a spot. 105 in the shade...
...and the women hardly wore anything at all. Very intelligent of them.
You just lie there in a hammock while three of them fan you.
Remember, Scotty?
- I remember.
Oh, boy. When I die I hope I go to Accra.
- I was there.
I'm in.
What are you doing here, Mr. Scott?
- Looking for a story.
Scotty's a newspaperman.
How many?
- Three.
Cards?
- I'll play these.
Caught from ambush.
- Check.
Well, I'll bet a buck.
- And I'll fold.
Call.
Pair of queens.
- I thought so. Aces.
You ought to know better than to try fooling our captain. Only dames can do that.
Lt. Dykes, I promise...
- Slip of the tongue.
What do you hear from the general?
- Fogarty's nursing secrets like a June bride.
I got an idea. A guy in Seattle knows a whole radar defense story...
...loves to talk.
General McLaren.
Tell General Fogarty you want to go to Seattle, and Pat and I will fly you there.
I met General McLaren too.
It's warm in Seattle. They got girls there without fur pants on.
What about it, captain?
- That could be right.
You won't be able to shoo our captain southward with his heart...
...wrapped around the North Pole.
- That'll do.
What's going on up there?
- Scientists are holding a convention.
Looking for polar bear tails.
- Ever hear of Dr. Carrington?
The fellow who was at Bikini?
- The same.
They're holding about 2000 miles north of here. A whole bunch.
Botanists, physicists, electronic...
- Including a pin-up girl.
Very interesting type too.
- Very.
Capt. Hendry can give you any data on her.
You probably shouldn't have said that.
- Well, after I read...
Now look!
Someday I hope to have a navigator and a copilot who are at least dry behind the ears.
Oh, captain.
- You mail-order...
Capt. Hendry, report to General Fogarty's quarters at once please.
8:00 at night and the general yelling for his troops. Sounds like the old days.
Take my hand. Will you?
- Yeah.
Captain, if it amounts to anything, bring me in on it. Will you, please?
Sure.
I gotta get a story someplace.
Come in.
Close the door.
- Yes, sir.
Good evening, sir.
- Didn't take you long.
Not many places to hide, sir.
Just got a queer message from your picnic party up north, from Dr. Carrington himself.
'Believe an airplane unusual type crashed in our vicinity.
Please send facilities to investigate.
Most urgent.'
What would you find up there besides a good-looking girl?
I don't know, sir. Any ships missing?
- No.
No Canadians either.
- Could be Russians.
They're all over the pole like flies.
- You're going.
Take along a dog team or anything you might need for rescue.
Come in.
Close the door!
You suppose the Pentagon could send us a revolving door?
Could be, sir. We got pith helmets last week.
Weather report, sir.
- Okay, that's all.
If any messages come in from Dr. Carrington,
I want to be notified personally.
No matter what the time.
- Yes, sir.
Here's your weather.
There's a front moving in...
...but you ought to have time to get there and back.
General, that newspaperman, Scott...
- What about him?
He'd like to go with us.
- It's all right if you maroon him up there.
Don't get me wrong about who gets marooned.
I'd like it if you didn't smash into the landing ski this time.
That was an unavoidable accident.
Well, look, I'll expect you back tomorrow night.
Yes, sir. And I'll close the door.
- Just tell me what you find up there.
No one tells me anything around here.
Want some coffee?
Hey, thanks.
- Here you are, sir.
Mr. Scott. Coffee.
Are we there?
- No, sir. Hot coffee up front, sir.
Lieutenant? Coffee, sir.
- Thank you, stewardess.
Coffee?
- Yeah, thanks.
How far are we from camp?
Three hours. We've slowed down.
A little headwind.
A little headwind?
Close to 40 miles.
Our captain has some funny ideas about the North Pole.
He thinks it's a garden spot.
Come and bring the kiddies.
Now look, don't you two guys start.
You know, Perry went to the North Pole once. He retired with a sack full of medals.
Hey, Pat.
We go there every three weeks just like it was lover's lane.
Mr. Scott, some people seem to think... Wait a minute.
Hello, Air Force 191 from
Polar Expedition 6. Can you read me?
Air Force 191. Hear you fine, Tex.
Go ahead.
What's your position?
- Three hours out.
Captain, switch over to your radio compass.
Check it against your magnetic heading.
What's on your mind, Tex?
We've got some disturbance up here.
It's whacking away at everything.
What do you figure it's from?
- Don't know. We noticed it last night.
Six to eight degrees difference.
- We're quite a bit off here, Tex.
You better home in on me.
I'll leave the key open.
Or would you rather have me sing to you?
- Leave the key open.
I was afraid you'd say that.
Hey, the taxpayers ought to see this.
Hello, doctor, professor.
Still the same game?
- Yes.
Hello, boys.
Doctor, professor. Here's your mail.
- You're just in time for lunch.
Ken, I bet you forgot my hairpins.
- Don't tell me I'm nearly at the North Pole.
Looks more like my Kentucky home.
- Mr. Scott, Mrs. Chapman.
A pleasure, Mrs. Chapman.
- Hi, nice to see you.
Dr. Chapman, Mr. Scott.
- Dr. Chapman.
Scotty's a newspaperman.
- You've come at an opportune time.
I happened to be in Anchorage when your message came. I hope you have a good story.
No more than you know already.
- Nothing more at all?
Just discussions as to what it might be.
We all have different ideas.
There's been arguments about it.
- Where's Dr. Carrington?
In the lab.
- See you later.
Does that mean you've seen the plane?
Coffee, captain?
- No, thanks.
Our captain seems in a hurry, Lee.
Where are you two going?
- We're with you.
We want to tell her she treated you badly.
- If you don't want us to go...
I'm gonna get even with you two someday.
- We got up in there.
Come in.
Hi, Pat. Welcome to our igloo.
How was your...?
Well...
How was your trip?
- All right. About usual.
Well, that's fine.
I think Dr. Carrington wants to see you.
- He can wait. I wanna talk to you.
What about?
- That was a dirty trick you played.
Don't lose your temper.
- Why did you do it? Just tell me why.
Well, your legs aren't very pretty.
You didn't have to write a note and put it on my chest.
I'm sorry, Pat...
Six people read it before I woke up.
Now the whole Air Force knows.
Not so loud. They'll hear.
- They already heard.
The only place it hasn't been is on a billboard.
I didn't know you had such a nasty temper.
Now, Pat, just be careful.
Now take it easy.
Now wait a minute.
We had a lot of fun when you were up here.
Then when you asked me down to Anchorage, you deliberately fed me...
Tell me, did you really drink all those drinks?
You didn't throw any away? Not one?
- No.
Holy cat. I thought I was good.
And another thing, why did you leave?
When I woke up in the morning you were gone.
I told you I had to take that cargo plane back here.
You told me?
- Don't you remember?
No.
Right after dinner. You were telling me all about a night in San Francisco...
Did I tell you that?
What else did I do?
Well, you had moments of kind of making like an octopus.
I never saw so many hands in all my life.
- All right. All right.
Look, my only excuse is that I liked you...
...right away.
So I started wrong. Can't we begin again?
- How would you begin?
Well, I can think of several...
- Never mind.
We don't have time for that now anyway.
I know Dr. Carrington's waiting to see you.
What about this business of starting over?
- We'll talk about that later.
Hello, captain.
- Hi, professor.
Dr. Carrington, Capt. Hendry is here.
- Yes, I know.
How do you do, captain?
- Doctor.
Miss Nicholson, would you add a note to the others?
Surely.
November 2, 11:30 A.M.
Deviation in sector 19 continues
12 degrees, 20 minutes east.
No lessening or wavering of disturbing element.
That's all.
Captain, can we start now?
- Mind telling me where we're going?
48 miles due east from here.
Your message said an airplane crashed.
Is that what we're looking for?
I don't know, captain.
I think you better explain.
- I'm sorry.
Miss Nicholson, would you read
Capt. Hendry my first notes?
I was thinking only of the vagueness of my information. I dislike being vague.
'November 1st...
- Yesterday.
...6:15 P.M. Sound detectors and seismographs registered explosion due east.
At 6:18, magnetometer revealed deviation
12 degrees, 20 minutes east.'
That deviation has been constant.
- We ran into it before we got here.
'Such deviation possible only if a disturbing force equivalent...
...to 20,000 tons of steel or iron ore...
- 20,000 tons?
...had become part of the earth at about a 50-mile radius.'
You're getting a bit beyond me, but it sounds like a meteor.
Yes, very much. Except for one thing.
Will, show it to Capt. Hendry.
- Yes, sir.
We have some special telescopic cameras.
On the appearance of radioactivity, a Geiger counter trips the release...
...and the cameras function.
They were working last evening.
This is the result.
This first picture was taken three minutes before the explosion...
...or 6:12.
You can see the small dot below there in the corner.
On the next picture, one minute later, that dot is moving from west to east...
...fast enough to form a streak.
- What shutter speed is it?
1000th of a second.
- Moving pretty fast. Wasn't it?
Here, at 6:14, it's moving upward.
6:15, it drops to the earth and vanishes.
A meteor might move almost horizontal to the earth but never upward.
Then it isn't a meteor.
- That's obvious.
How'd you find the distance of impact?
By computation...
- Dr. Carrington?
Ready?
- It's quite simple, captain.
We have the time of arrival of the sound waves and detectors.
And also the arrival time of the impact waves on the seismograph.
By computing the difference, it becomes obvious they were caused by the object.
The distance from here is 48 miles.
- I'll take your word for it.
One thing, doctor. 20,000 tons of steel is a lot of metal for an airplane.
It is for the sort of airplane we know, captain.
Yeah, we'd better be going.
- Redding will check every quarter-hour.
Will you want me, doctor?
- It won't be necessary.
You come with us, Bill.
- Yes, doctor.
We'll be there pretty soon now, Pat.
Bob, get Carrington up here.
Doctor!
We're almost 50 miles out, doctor.
With your compass deviation, how are you navigating, captain?
That peak ahead is practically due east.
We got the wind before we left camp.
Very good, captain.
- We should be there about now, Pat.
Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six.
Picking up something on the Geiger counter, sir.
Five. Four. Three. Two. One.
Look there.
Pat, the compass is in a spin.
- Geiger's up to the top.
Yeah, that's it, all right.
You see someplace to set down?
- Looked smooth about a half a mile back.
We'll take a look. Bob!
Get them ready. It might be rough.
Right, sir.
Fasten your seat belts, gentlemen.
We're gonna land.
Sit down and hold on back there.
All set for landing, sir.
Half flaps.
Full rich.
- Full rich.
Half flaps.
There we are.
Holy cat! What a weird-looking thing.
Let me get a picture before you track up the whole place.
This Geiger counter is going crazy.
Something's melted that surface crust.
It's frozen over again into clear ice.
The bottle shape apparently was caused by the craft first making contact...
...with the earth out at the neck of the bottle...
...sliding toward us and forming that larger area as it came to rest.
With the engines generating enough heat to melt that path through the crust...
...then sink beneath the surface.
- What could melt that much ice?
Let's go down and see. Barnes.
Take the dogs over on that side.
Dr. Chapman, could an airplane melt that much ice?
One of our own jets generates enough heat to warm a 50-story office building.
It's part of an airfoil. Probably a stabilizer.
- It's an airplane, all right.
Can you tell what metal that is?
- I'll need some tools.
Barnes, bring some tools!
Hey, it's down pretty deep over here.
I can't see anything but a dark mass.
It's deeper over here.
Captain, may I suggest that we spread out and try to determine the size and shape.
Right. Spread out, everybody! We're gonna try to figure out the shape of this thing.
Here's the tools, sir.
Holy cat!
Hey...
It's almost...
Yeah. Almost a perfect...
It is. It's round.
We finally got one.
- We found a flying saucer!
Can anybody see anything through the ice?
Only an outline.
- Nothing but a dark shape.
Seems perfectly smooth.
No doors or windows.
I can't see any engine.
- I doubt we find anything we call an engine.
Dr. Carrington, this isn't any metal I know.
Probably some new alloy.
Get some filings for analysis.
- Right.
Captain, I don't think we have a chance of chopping through the ice with axes.
I know. We think so too.
We'll try to melt it out with thermite bombs.
Oh, excellent.
- Where do you figure it's from?
I don't know, Mr. Scott.
Well, from this planet?
- I doubt it.
Well, do you...?
- The answers will be much easier...
...after we've examined the interior of the aircraft...
...and its occupants, if there are any.
- Occupants? Why, I never...
What a story!
Where's the radio? Hey, Barnes!
Hold it. No private messages.
- What do you mean private?
I'm sending it to the whole world.
- This is Air Force information.
We'll have to wait for authority to let you file it.
You got your authority in the Constitution!
It's called freedom of the press.
I'm sending a story!
- Not from our ship.
Where do you want the bombs?
- One by the stabilizer...
...another over in the far side if we need it.
It's the biggest story since the parting of the Red Sea. You can't hide it!
Think what it means to the world.
- I don't work for the world.
Look...
- No, Scott. I'll take that.
Here's the detonator.
- Get back to the ship and call the camp.
Have Tex radio we've found a flying saucer in the ice. We're gonna try to get it out.
What about me?
- Also, ask if Scott can send his story.
That's all I can do.
- You're gonna grow up to be another Fogarty.
Where we gonna touch this off?
- Over there.
Have you looked to the west?
That front's moving fast...
...and the temperature's dropping too.
- We don't have more than an hour.
Where do you put those, Bob?
- Right on the surface.
Tell Stone. Will you, sir?
- Right.
Say, what will this thermite do?
This is S-O-P, standard operating procedure for removing ice.
Hook this wire up, will you, lieutenant?
It just melts it.
How fast does it work?
It'll uncover the whole saucer in 30 seconds.
All ready over here!
- Be right with you!
Better clear the field! Over near the dog sled! Gonna get pretty hot here in a minute.
Hook her up. We'll try the stabilizer first. Use the other one if we need it.
A few minutes from now we may have the key to the stars.
A million years of history are waiting for us in that ice.
Say when. I wanna get a picture.
- All ready, sir.
Ready here.
- Let her go, Bob.
Okay, all clear.
- Wait a minute, everybody. Stay back.
It's burning under the ice.
- Careful, captain.
What's happening?
Tell me, doctor.
Get down on the ground, everybody!
Everybody all right?
That last explosion was the engine.
Sergeant, will you try your Geiger counter?
Only a trace.
- That's just residual.
It's all gone.
Secrets that might have given us a new science.
Gone.
- That's just dandy.
Standard operating procedure.
I should've thought...
- You sure should.
Greatest discovery in history up in flames.
Turning a new civilization into a 4th of July piece.
Captain, I'm getting something over here.
Probably a fragment from the saucer.
- We may salvage something yet.
Hold it, everybody.
I'm getting a reaction.
Let me get a reading.
Getting warm.
Hotter now.
Here's where it's coming from.
What is it?
- Looks like a man.
It's got legs and a head.
I can see them.
Yeah! He must be over 8 feet long.
Somebody got out of that saucer.
- Or was thrown out.
And frozen fast before he could get clear.
Man from Mars.
- How do you propose getting him out?
I don't know.
- Use more thermite.
Whatever's quickest.
We don't have much time.
Here's axes. You could chop around and put the block on the plane.
I agree.
- Get started.
Give me room.
- Bob, clear the sled and bring it over here.
Eddie, get the ship warmed up.
And be ready to get out of here in a hurry.
Pat, I think we made a mistake.
- What do you mean?
You ever read this? 'Department of Defense, Office of Public Information.
Washington, D.C.
December 27, 1949.
Bulletin 629-49 regarding item 6700...
...extract 75,131.
The Air Force has discontinued investigating and evaluating reported flying saucers...
...on the basis that there is no evidence.'
Probably make you a general for destroying evidence that they're wrong.
'The Air Force said that all evidence indicates that the reports...
...of unidentified flying objects are the result of:
One: Misinterpretation of various conventional objects.'
Didn't look very conventional to me.
'Second: A mild form of mass hysteria.'
That'd be when General Fogarty got to shaking hands with that thing in the ice.
What are the other reasons?
'Third: That they're jokes.'
What did you say the number of that bulletin was?
'629-49, item 6700, extract 75,131.'
Oh. Oh, that one.
Get on that rope, professor.
- I need a hand over here.
Watch your feet.
Let me tie another rope to go down.
Hold it!
- Hold it back now.
Hold it!
Pull, back there!
Keep tight on those ropes!
Easy.
- Here we go.
Keep it going.
- Keep it going!
Whoa! Take it easy.
Can't see through the ice too good.
Good enough to know that where he came from, they don't breed them for beauty.
Well, what do we do now, defrost him?
This ice will melt pretty soon.
Can you control the heat in this room?
- No, captain. This is our storeroom.
The temperature's constant here.
We don't need to melt it.
We can chip it away.
We're not going to melt it or chip it. Eddie, open that window.
We're not allowed to examine it?
- I mean just that.
This is stupid.
- We're scientists.
And Dr. Carrington's in charge here.
- Hey, Pat, these windows don't open.
It's practically certain we'll be asked by your superiors to study it.
Probably, but we can't permit it now.
- We don't need permission...
Eddie, break that window.
- All right.
Sorry. We already pulled one boner out in the ice.
We may not know anything about this...
...but until I receive instructions from my superior officer, we'll have to mark time.
You have no authority...
- If you want to talk, do it in the corridor.
It's gonna get cold in here.
- At last a sensible suggestion, captain.
Mac.
- Yeah?
Please stay here.
And take four-hour shifts.
It's hands off for everyone.
- Yes, sir.
Gonna be warm enough?
- If not, you'll hear me squawk.
Bob will bring you dinner.
- I could use something to read.
A nice, quiet horror story.
- Might be kind of tame for you, sir.
Well, gentlemen?
- Capt. Hendry...
Excuse me, doctor. May I?
- Certainly.
In relation to removing the body from the ice, I'd like to point out...
...there are organisms that survive after death, but cold can destroy them.
In view of that...
- I don't know...
But these organisms may be dangerous. They may be carrying germs from another planet.
Germs we couldn't cope with medically.
- Thank you.
I can't agree with you, Dr. Chapman.
- I don't either.
Here's another: We don't know what effect the air of our Earth...
...may have on this creature's remains.
- Sort of go up in smoke, like the saucer?
Nonsense.
- Isn't that far-fetched?
So is a man from Mars.
- We're getting nowhere.
I suggest that Capt. Hendry communicate with his superior at once.
I'm getting senile.
We should have done that first thing.
I'm surprised, captain, that you didn't try to reach your general on our way back here.
We did. Barnes.
I tried through your radio operator.
Couldn't get through. Too much interference.
I see. My apologies, captain.
- Yes, doctor.
Hi, captain.
- Hi, Tex.
You sure stirred up a lot of trouble...
Did you send out my message?
- Sure did.
Get an answer back?
- This came an hour ago. Can you read it?
No, you'd better.
- 'Fogarty to Hendry:
Withhold newspaper story until permission from Air Force HQ.'
There you are, Scotty.
- Fine. Now somebody else will get the story.
'Remove aircraft from ice at once. Use thermite bombs if necessary to melt ice.'
Oh, that's what I like about the Army.
Smart all the way to the top.
That lets you off the hook for the thermite...
- Take it easy. Go ahead.
'Erect temporary structure to protect aircraft until my arrival.'
Here's another one. Came a few minutes ago.
Could only get part of it.
Go ahead.
- 'Everything grounded. Can't...' Something.
'Want you...' Something or other...
- That sounds like Fogarty.
Then it got fouled up.
- You're getting nothing?
Nothing. Static's knocking it right out of the air.
What about your stuff?
- Don't know if they're getting it. I doubt it.
I don't believe it.
Even the Pony Express got through.
Well, doctor?
- In view of this new situation...
Doesn't alter the old one.
- We disagree with you.
There's no reason to delay...
- Sorry, gentlemen. That's it.
Tex, I'd like to leave Barnes to help out all he can.
Sure.
- Barnes, keep trying to get through.
I wanna get a message to the general.
Tell him the aircraft was completely destroyed by the thermite bomb.
Tell him we found a passenger...
- A fellow from Mars? Where?
On ice, buddy.
Tell him the body's in ice and Dr. Carrington wants permission...
...to remove the body from the ice for examination.
We're standing by for instructions before further action.
Yes, sir.
You got anything to add, doctor?
- Yes, one very essential point.
That it's vitally important that the examination be made.
By all means. Yeah.
- Add that, Barnes.
Thank you, captain.
That's all that concerns me.
When you get your answer,
I expect you to let me know.
Yes, doctor.
Wait till I interview the doctor about what he thinks of you.
Probably be good.
- If it isn't, I'll make it good.
Tex, keep trying. Barnes, if he gets through, ask again about clearing Mr. Scott.
Don't try to soft-soap me.
I don't like you any better.
I'll eat with you, Eddie.
- I'll send you some chow.
Captain, I'm gonna check the ship and tie her down. We'll need our gear.
This storm may blow for weeks.
- Get the Eskimos to help.
They took off when they saw that ice.
They'll need a lot of coaxing to get them back.
If Mr. Scott and the lieutenant would give me a hand...
I'm a guest.
- I'm an officer.
You can order me around while carrying the other end.
That'll help a lot, sarge.
You know, Pat? I thought we were gonna have a little trouble.
So did I.
- The geniuses were ready to tear you apart.
They're like kids drooling over a new fire engine.
Professor Vorhees, come to the laboratory as soon as possible.
Holding a meeting. Whole thing's weird.
- You know what it reminds me of?
The time I was stuck on Beulen Island with the old 97th bomber group.
An Army nurse came ashore and caused the same disturbance...
...as this guy from Mars has here.
- What happened to the nurse?
She liked it there.
Scotty, what's new?
- What's new? What more do you want?
Biggest story ever to hit this planet, and I run into this human clam.
Why are you getting pretty?
You'll never look good to me.
That's not for you...
- Take it easy.
The captain here passes the buck to
General Fogarty, he takes it to Washington.
Who will Truman ask?
- Margaret.
I've got to find a way to get to civilization.
- How, for instance?
I don't know. Pogo sticks. Kiddie cars.
Gondolas. Dogsleds.
Hey, Barnes, any word come from Fogarty?
- Plenty. Nothing about you, sir.
I think the old man's gone crazy.
Sorry, sir. Shouldn't have said that.
If he hollers louder, we won't need a radio.
- What was the gist of the conversation?
There's been a leak, and the newspapers...
- I knew it! Like water through a sieve.
Everyone wants information,
Congress, Secretary of State...
...and especially General Fogarty.
He's having a fit.
Isn't Anchorage picking us up?
- No, sir.
We're picking up them because they have a stronger station.
A picture just came to me:
My editor climbing all over his office...
...yelling, stamping his feet.
He'll probably shoot himself by midnight.
Take it easy, Scotty.
- Just a minute. I'm not sure you're ready.
You may have missed a spot.
Son, would you like double guard duty tonight?
No, sir. I wouldn't.
Oh, captain.
- Yes, sergeant?
Could I see you for a minute, sir?
- Sure.
What is it, Bob?
It's about Lt. McPherson sitting in there with that thing in the block of ice.
Getting nervous?
Well, he wouldn't want me to tell you, sir, but he's having kittens.
I haven't heard him squawk like this since Rechenberg.
Really?
You see, sir, the ice is clearing up, and we can see that thing pretty good.
It's got crazy hands and no hair, and the eyes...
They're open and look like they can see.
- Bob, I haven't heard you...
It's got me too, sir, and I wasn't in there very long.
Besides that, it's pretty cold.
I got the lieutenant an electric blanket.
Captain, I got a suggestion.
- Go ahead.
Instead of four-hour shifts, we could cut them in half...
Okay. You tell Barnes to take over at 2200.
You take over at 2400, and I'll relieve you at 0200.
I think you're right, sir.
- I think you are.
Thank you, sir.
I want to talk to you.
- Sure.
Pat, what's really going on?
Nothing. I just can't agree with your pals.
I had to set a guard.
They'd have that thing up waltzing with them.
No, that isn't what I meant.
What does that boogeyman in ice really mean?
I don't know, Nikki.
Well, does it mean that we'll have visitors from other planets dropping in on us?
Do we have to return the call, or...?
Oh, jeepers.
I know. Yesterday I'd said it was crazy.
- I'd say it's crazy now.
Forget it. Tomorrow it'll all seem different.
I suppose so. I like the way you handled this whole mess, Pat.
I'd just as soon not.
You know, it's funny. I'm glad I was here.
I am too.
You're much nicer when you're...
When you're not mad.
Sounds promising. How about that business of beginning over again?
Well, I think I'll buy you a drink this time.
I think you've earned it.
That is, if you want one.
- You can tie my hands if you wanna.
That might not be such a bad idea.
- You mean that?
Well, you suggested it.
- All right. I'll bring a rope.
You want another one, Pat?
- Don't you think you could untie me now?
I don't know. What's the matter?
You gals. If a guy asks you to dinner and buys you a drink and tries to kiss you...
Why are you laughing?
- You never kissed me.
I haven't tried.
- How do you know?
Oh, stop bringing that up.
- Never mind. You haven't. Maybe if you'd...
Go on with what you were saying.
- What?
About the dinner and the drink.
Well, if the same man asked you to have 30,000 dinners...
Then he's not a wolf anymore?
That's fine philosophy.
So you really want your hands untied.
Just when everything was nice and peaceful.
You know, I'm glad we decided to start over again. I like it.
I like that too.
- Talk about Japanese tortures.
No, not at all. I think this was a great idea.
Come here.
Well, look at you...
...sitting there like a civilized man instead of grabbing around like a throwback.
If you weren't tied up, I wouldn't dare have told you how much I liked you.
You know, Pat, the trouble with you is that you don't know anything about women.
What a woman wants is to...
Is to...
How long have you been loose?
- Long enough.
It's been a very interesting evening.
Good night, Miss Nicholson.
Pat, if you walk out on me like this...
- I wouldn't go, except I gotta check up.
Get a good night's sleep.
I'll see you in the morning.
It's the eyes being open that gets you.
Makes you feel so...
Hi, Pat. Barnes just got here. Sure glad
I'm not looking at that guy anymore.
All set, Barnes?
- Yes, sir.
Got an electric flying suit and coffee.
- Bob will relieve you at 2400.
Take it easy.
- Yeah.
That's better.
Capt. Hendry! Capt. Hendry!
Capt. Hendry.
What's the matter, corporal?
Where's the captain? I've got to tell him that thing's alive. I saw it.
It chased me. It's not dead. It's...
Capt. Hendry!
That thing's alive, sir.
I saw it. I shot at it. I hit it, I know it.
Nothing happened. It kept coming at me, making a noise like a cat meowing.
If you could have seen those hands and those eyes! You've got to do something...
Mac, Bob, get some guns.
Now, Barnes, what happened?
I'm sorry, sir. I don't know exactly, but all of a sudden it was alive and coming at me.
I shot at it and hit it.
Nothing happened, so I ran...
Easy, easy.
- I'm sorry, sir.
Here, captain.
- Take care of him. Will you?
Get back to sleep.
Get back with the rest of them.
What could've...?
- Kid said he was alive. I believe him.
I knew it. All the time I was here,
I could feel it.
Here's what did it.
This blanket was on. It's still warm.
He got out of here, all right.
- Get parkas, boots and a flashlight!
Listen. They'll tear him to pieces.
- We must save him.
Hold it, doctor. You'll freeze to death in five minutes. Use your head!
I expect you're right. I was overanxious.
- Look over here, captain!
I think I've got yours.
- May I have one, captain?
Better let us go, doctor.
Doc, can you see anything out there?
- Not much.
You all set?
- Let her go.
Captain, it would help if you, any of you, would describe what you saw out there.
It was too cold to see well, but the dogs had him down.
He got up with three hanging on his arm.
- He threw one at the rest.
Two were dead.
- Looked like they'd been through a chopper.
Where did you find the arm?
- Partly under one of them.
Could dogs tear off an arm?
This kind of an arm.
Be careful, doctor. Those barbs are sharp.
- Seems to be a sort of chitinous substance.
Speak English.
Something between a beetle's back and a rose thorn.
Thorn-fingered?
- Amazingly strong.
Very effective as a weapon.
- Very.
We don't have to worry about that. An arm off and out in that cold, he's dead now.
Got along fine in a block of ice for 24 hours.
Pretty spry for a guy with 12 dogs on him.
- And for losing an arm.
I'm losing my mind.
- Amazing, isn't it?
Amazingly strong.
- Strange.
I'm sure of it.
- That is blood on the hand. Isn't it?
Yes, but not his.
- Probably from one of the dogs.
There's no blood in the arm, no animal tissue.
Dr. Stern, would you have a look at this under the microscope?
No, Mr. Scott. I doubt very much if it can die, as we understand dying.
Holy cat!
- Yes.
Well, doctor?
No arterial structure indicated.
No nerve endings visible.
Porous, unconnected cellular growth.
Just a minute, doctor. Sounds like you're trying to describe a vegetable.
I am. Are you getting all of this?
- Oh, for Pete's sake!
You know, doctor, that could be why
Sgt. Barnes' bullets had no effect.
That's right.
- Merely holes drilled into vegetable matter.
This green fluid here.
Like plant sap.
- We'll probably find it has a sugar base.
Please, doctor, I've got to ask this.
It sounds like, well... Just as though you're describing some form of super carrot.
That's nearly right, Mr. Scott.
This carrot, as you call it, has constructed an aircraft capable of flying millions of miles...
...propelled by a force as yet unknown to us.
An intellectual carrot. The mind boggles.
- It shouldn't.
Imagine how strange it would have seemed during the Pliocene age...
...to forecast that worms, fish, lizards that crawled over the Earth would evolve into us.
On the planet from which our visitor came...
...vegetable life underwent an evolution similar to that of our own animal life...
...which would account for the superiority of its brain.
Its development was not handicapped by emotional or sexual factors.
Dr. Carrington, you won the Nobel Prize.
You've received every kind of kudos a scientist can attain.
If you were for sale, I could get a million bucks for you from any foreign government.
I'm not, therefore, gonna stick my neck out and say you're stuffed full...
...of wild blueberry muffins. But I promise you, my readers are gonna think so.
Not for long, Mr. Scott. Not if they know anything about the flora of their own planet.
You mean there are vegetables right here on Earth that can think?
A certain kind of thinking, yes.
You ever hear of the telegraph vine?
Not recently.
- Or the...
Is it the acanthus century plant, Dr. Stern?
- Yes.
Go ahead, doctor. That's your field.
Well, the century plant catches mice, bats, squirrels, any small mammals.
Uses a sweet syrup as bait, then holds onto its catch and feeds on it.
What's the telegraph vine?
The vine, research has proven, can signal to other vines of the same species...
...vines 20 to 100 miles away.
Intelligence in plants and vegetables is an old story, Mr. Scott.
Older even than the animal arrogance that has overlooked it.
That's one for Ripley.
- Look here.
I took this from under the soft tissue in the palm of the hand.
A seedpod.
- Seedpod?
Yes. The neat and unconfused reproductive technique of vegetation.
No pain or pleasure as we know it.
No emotions...
...no heart.
Our superior. Our superior in every way.
Gentlemen, do you realize what we've found?
A being from another world as different from us as one pole from the other.
If we can only communicate with it...
...we can learn secrets that have been hidden from mankind since the beginning...
Holy cat. It's moving.
Miss Nicholson.
- Yes, doctor?
At 12:10 A.M., the hand became alive.
The temperature of the forearm showed a 20-degree rise.
Because of this rise in temperature,
I believe it was able to ingest...
...the canine blood with which it was covered. I believe...
You mean...
You mean it lives on blood.
This is the best we could find.
- This should work.
Where are you going?
- To find our visitor, if we can.
One moment, captain!
Check the storeroom again.
Bolt any outside doors.
Captain, when you find what you're looking for...
...remember it's a stranger in a strange land.
The only crimes were those committed against it.
It woke from a block of ice, was attacked by dogs and shot by a frightened man.
All I want is to communicate with it.
- Fine, provided it's locked up.
If we catch him, let me take his picture before somebody makes a salad of him.
Sure, Scotty.
Bob, get up on there.
- What's up? Looks like a lynching party.
Have any visitors?
- Not a soul.
I got part of a message from the general.
He said to wait on Mr. Scott's story.
What's the difference?
Nothing's going out anyway.
What are you looking for?
- Couldn't come in here.
Who?
- The man from Mars.
You mean he's alive and loose?
Keep your door locked. Use your axe if you have to. Gun's no good.
What do you mean the gun's no good?
Now, look...
Eddie.
Hold it, captain.
There's something in here, all right.
- You're a little off base.
That's the mineralogy lab.
Radioactive isotopes are in there.
Your Geiger's reacting to a roomful of uranium ore samples.
Yeah.
This door's locked.
- Dr. Stern has the key.
Oh, yes.
- What's in here?
The greenhouse. The Eskimos have a weakness for our strawberries.
Strawberries at the North Pole.
- Excuse me.
Mac. Bob.
Look under these tables.
Bob, check that outside door.
Door's locked, sir.
- Nothing up here.
We're still batting zero.
Well, doctor?
- Captain, I...
Nothing up that other corridor.
- Any suggestions, doctor?
He's obviously not inside.
- We'll start looking outside...
Close the door, please.
- Never mind.
Captain, half an hour outside now is all we can stand. We'd better do it in relay.
You're right, Dr. Chapman. We'll work out...
- Would you close the door, please?
We have to tell General Fogarty what happened.
We're liable to become famous.
So few people can boast they've lost a flying saucer and a man from Mars all in one day.
Wonder what they'd have done to Columbus if he'd discovered America, then mislaid it.
Bunch of butterfingers.
Gentlemen, I just happened to notice...
Look at these moles.
They're wilted.
The only thing that could...
A blast of icy air if that rear door was opened.
Have a look at that lock, professor.
- Yes.
10 or 15 seconds of exposure would do it.
- Exactly.
What would that lead you to?
That it may have been...
In here.
- Without a doubt.
Dr. Carrington, you were right.
The lock's been forced back into position.
The key's gone. Someone has entered and gone and locked the door from...
From the outside.
- Look. See how it glistens in the light?
It's a smear of...
Plant sap. From the wounded arm?
- You don't suppose...?
Open it, please.
One of the sled dogs.
- Not even cold yet.
Doctor, doesn't it seem kind of...?
- Shrunken. Is there any blood in there?
None.
- No blood.
No blood?
- Its blood has been drained.
Everything falls right into line.
What could be more natural for such a being than seeking out the only open earth nearby?
It came here for refuge, heard us and ran.
It's been here. It will come back again.
- We better tell...
I don't agree. It's far better if science rather than the Army...
Are you sure this is the best thing to do?
- I'm sure we can communicate with it.
It's wiser than we are. It's our only chance to talk to it, to learn so many things.
Dr. Carrington is right.
- Surely you understand that, Stern.
Will you two stand guard here with me tonight?
Surely, doctor.
- All right.
Stern, tell Dr. Auerbach and Dr. Olson what we've found.
Ask them to come back and relieve us in the morning.
And tell them, please, to confide in no one.
Any luck, captain?
- Lee, you better get some more coffee ready.
Find anything, captain?
- Not a sign.
Barnes flushed a polar bear.
- Sure did.
Scare you?
- Not after I saw it was only a bear.
Too cold out there for that.
- You didn't find anything.
I didn't think you would.
When we lose them, they stay lost.
Not that it makes much difference.
Nothing's coming in on the radio.
Tex, you got something?
- General Fogarty's running a temperature.
This came in clear 10 minutes ago, then it got fouled up again.
'Fogarty to Hendry: Take all precautions to preserve aircraft carefully until my arrival.'
Same to same.'Use same precautions with corpses of any occupants.'
Same to same.
'Forward detailed description of aircraft.
Measurements, approximate weight and so forth. Important.'
'Fogarty to Hendry: Why haven't you answered? Want immediate answer.'
Same to same.'Radio silence unnecessary.
Reference message Fogarty to Hendry.
Acknowledge immediately.
Waiting report. Silence confusing.'
Same to same.'Acknowledge. '
Same to same...
- Acknowledge at once.
I gather he wants to hear from me.
- There's nothing for me? I don't believe it.
How can a man get to be a general without...?
In the greenhouse...
See...
Barnes, watch that corridor.
- Bring the first aid kit.
Captain, this is my job.
- Bob, better start warning the rest of camp.
Does that speaker system work from here?
- Yes. The left switch runs to all rooms.
Attention, everybody in camp.
Bolt your doors.
Our visitor has returned and is dangerous.
Stay where you are until notified.
Stay where you are.
Easy. It'll be all right.
- What happened, doctor?
In the greenhouse,
I was working. I couldn't see.
Then a blast of cold air, and I heard Olson scream.
When I turned, the thing struck at me.
- Go on.
I don't remember. My head...
I must have fallen.
When I came to, I saw Olson and Auerbach.
They were...
Give him some more of that. Get those axes.
Go ahead, doctor.
They were both hanging from the beams upside down, dead. Their throats were cut.
I crawled...
- Was it there when you left?
I couldn't see.
Here you are, sir.
- Wait, Pat! I want to get a picture.
Wait a minute. He could get out of the greenhouse through the outside door.
We can get to it through the generator room.
- You two go with him.
You mean go in?
- Seal the door with anything you can find.
That's better.
Easy. Give them time to get in there.
- Pat, I want a picture.
You get back with the rest.
- Don't be silly.
It'll cost you a drink.
- I'll buy him a beer.
Ready, Bob?
- No, but go ahead and open it.
Get something to prop this door, something short enough to get under this bolt!
Get your picture, Scotty?
- No. The door wasn't open long enough.
Want me to open it again?
- No!
Bring a hammer and some spikes!
- Hit that in, will you?
There. That ought to do it.
Doctor Chapman, you're sure there's no other way out? No windows?
Only the front and back doors.
- The walls solid?
Corrugated iron.
- You don't think that...?
You found a dog in there, bled white by our visitor. Why didn't you report it?
It wasn't necessary.
- It was necessary to leave friends to die?
I posted them as guards...
I looked in. They're hanging upside down like in a slaughterhouse. Wish you'd seen it.
Can't we do something?
- They're dead.
Let's see nobody joins them. Doctor, you're limited to your room, lab and the mess hall.
You have no authority of any kind.
No right to assume...
You better move along.
We've got the rear door blocked.
If he gets out...
...he'll have to dig through oil drums and a couple tons of snow.
Bob, next time raise the sights a little.
- I was too busy to think about that.
We're gonna have to set up a guard here in the corridor.
Two-hour shifts. We'll need volunteers.
- Count me in, captain.
You sent for us, doctor?
You said you had news for us, doctor.
Yes, yes. I...
Gentlemen, we find ourselves in a battle.
I'm not referring to the minor argument with Capt. Hendry...
...but this creature from a new world.
Two of our colleagues have died, a third is injured.
Those are our losses, and there may be more.
This creature is more powerful and intelligent than we are.
He regards us as important only for his nourishment.
He has the same attitude toward us as we have toward a field of cabbages.
That is our battle.
Only science can conquer him.
All other weapons will be powerless, only...
There must...
There must be a way. I've been trying to...
Sorry. I'm very tired. I haven't slept.
It's difficult...
Difficult to talk.
Will you read my notes, Miss Nicholson?
- Doctor, you need some rest.
Yes, I know, but...
Please read my notes.
'At 9:00 P.M., I placed the seeds taken from the severed hand of X...
...in four inches of earth.
I saturated the earth...
I saturated the earth with two units of plasma taken from our blood bank.
The condition of the dog found in the greenhouse indicated blood...
...was a primal factor in the cultivation of the seeds.
At 2:00 A.M...
At 2:00 A.M., the first sprouts appeared through the soil.'
Five hours.
- Yes. I used another two units of plasma.
At 4:00 A.M., the sprouts began to take on definite form.
I came to the conclu...
I see by your faces you don't believe me.
Well, you may judge for yourselves.
Oh, no. It isn't possible.
It reproduces itself.
- Amazing speed.
This would bear out
Capt. Hendry's impression.
When he saw the creature in the greenhouse, it had grown a new arm.
This pulsating, doctor?
- As though they were breathing.
Yes. Human plants.
- Superhuman.
All this because of the blood plasma?
- That's correct.
Notice these, closer to the source of the plasma. While these, farther away.
How many units have we?
- Enough, I hope.
Would you care to listen to them,
Professor Wilson?
Yes, thank you. I should.
Well?
Almost like the wail of a newborn child that's hungry.
That's the way I would have described it.
- Doctor?
Yes, Miss Nicholson?
- Would you mind very much if I...?
Will you be needing me anymore?
- No. Just finish typing my notes.
Return them to me.
Let no one see them.
Doctor, I think you should get some sleep.
There's too much to do.
Your mind can't work if you're exhausted.
- My mind's still clear.
No, it isn't, doctor. You aren't thinking of what's happening in the greenhouse.
He's growing those seeds in there using blood. Just as you are.
You've seen what one creature like that can do. Just imagine a thousand.
I have imagined it.
- Arthur...
...what if that aircraft came not just to visit the Earth...
...but to conquer it? To start growing some kind of horrible army?
To turn the human race into food for it?
- Many things threaten our world...
...new stars, comets shooting...
- But those are theories.
This is an enemy here.
- There are no enemies in science...
...only phenomena to study.
We are studying one.
Come in.
Hello, Pat.
- Hi. Nikki, I want to ask you something.
Has anybody up here been hurt lately?
Anybody shot, stabbed or operated on?
No. That what-is-it in the greenhouse has been our first diversion.
I brought up 35 units of blood plasma two months ago. What's become of it?
Why do you want to know?
- Why are they not giving it to Dr. Stern?
They're giving him blood transfusions instead of plasma. Two live donors.
What's Carrington doing with
35 units of blood plasma?
I guess...
I guess you'd better take a swing at my chin and have a look at those notes.
I should be trying to stop you.
So that's what he's been doing.
Thanks. Thanks for not stopping me.
Pat, would you remember something?
He's tired.
He hasn't slept since you found that thing. And he's not thinking right.
I know him. And he doesn't think the way we do anyway.
But he's found something no one can understand. Until he can solve it, he'Il...
You know, like a kid with a new toy...
- Only this toy's liable to bite him.
Thanks again.
Where's Dr. Carrington?
I'm sorry. I have no authorization to give you any...
I'm very busy.
- I know you're busy, doctor.
I understand you've been gardening.
Where are they?
Why?
- This way to the nursery, Pat.
I don't tolerate intrusions into my laboratory. Don't touch.
This is what your colleagues are doing in the greenhouse.
This is an improvement.
- What happened was not my fault.
We've read your notes.
You should have consulted us.
I have the help I need.
Your opinion has not been asked.
It has by Capt. Hendry. And I've given it to him. I'll repeat it for you.
We're facing something unpredictably dangerous.
The creature in the greenhouse is obviously multiplying itself.
We have no way of finding out how much.
It will need more blood and will try to obtain what it needs.
It's imprisoned and harmless.
- How can you be sure of our safety?
Or the safety of the world?
Think of 1000 such creatures. 10,000. It must be destroyed, this progeny with it.
No.
- We can burn these.
What about that thing in the greenhouse?
- You're like frightened boys.
You're right. I am frightened.
- Any destruction would be an outrage...
...a betrayal of science.
- It may be.
But I'll sleep better if we get rid of it.
- Captain, Barnes finally...
...got a message through.
Here's the answer.
Go ahead.
- 'Fogarty to Hendry:
Carrington informs me Martian alive.
Keep it alive and protect it against injury.
Under no circumstances take action against it until my arrival.'
You have your orders, Capt. Hendry.
I consider them sane and intelligent.
But, Tex, what about me?
- Not a thing, Scotty.
What do we do, Pat?
- Try changing the Army's mind.
Hey! Hey, it's me, Eddie!
What are you doing here?
- We can't take it out there.
Drop the idea of guarding from the outside.
The wind's blowing so hard you can't see.
It can go through walls as easy as doors.
How could it get through iron walls?
- Use a can opener.
We're dropping the outside guard.
- Put that hand in some ice water.
Who's out in the corridor?
- Stone and Wilson, sir.
Barnes, tell them they're the only ones on guard. Tell them to watch it.
Tex?
- Here I am.
You won't be long.
We're dropping the outside guard.
Come join the rest of them in the mess hall.
I'll be all right. I've got the door braced, and there's no outside windows.
All right. If you want to be brave.
Well.
- Pat, what are we gonna do?
Anybody around here want some coffee?
No, but you can come in.
That's the reason I brought it.
I was hoping you might ask me in.
Who wants some?
- I could use a half.
What were you saying, Scotty?
- I was wondering... That's enough. Thanks.
What happens if our boyfriend gets lonely and strolls around and ends up in here?
I've been figuring that.
- Nothing hurts it.
What do you do with a vegetable?
- Boil it.
What'd you say?
- Boil it. Stew it. Bake it. Fry it.
That makes sense.
- Cold doesn't bother it.
Maybe Dr. Carrington will ask it to crawl into a boiler.
Maybe you could borrow a flamethrower.
- Captain, I got a crazy idea.
We got lots of kerosene and we could...
Point three. Point four.
- Here's where we start cooking.
Point five. Point six.
That thing's out of the greenhouse.
Stay together.
Point nine. What about throwing kerosene on it and setting it on fire?
We can try.
- Here's a full can.
I'll take it. We'll need something to put it in.
Here's a pail.
- Here's another.
One point two.
- We need one more.
Pat, this one will work all right.
- Good.
Watch that cigarette, lieutenant.
How we gonna set it on fire, rub sticks together?
There's a Veri pistol in my bag.
- I'll get it.
If it comes in, you wet it down.
Mac, touch it off. And don't miss.
You be ready if it needs more.
- You're right.
Shut up.
- One point three now.
You know how to shoot that?
- I saw Gary Cooper in Sergeant York.
One point four.
- Come here. Get in the corner.
Hold this in front of you.
Stay by the light switch.
One point five. One point six.
What was that?
- It sounded like a window.
One point eight.
- Turn off those lights.
One point nine.
The needle's hit the top.
Put the fire out!
- I am!
Watch it, captain!
Block that window!
- Hey, Scotty!
This will make your hand feel better.
- Thank you.
This ought to be enough kerosene.
- Get it ready.
How's it coming, Barnes?
- It'll be okay.
What makes me mad is he didn't do it.
I busted it falling over the bunk.
Listen, we want you all to stay here.
We found a way to fight this thing, but burned out a room.
It's not hurt much, from the way it took off.
- About as much effect as a hot foot.
It's sure to come back.
We don't want to burn the whole place.
So we're going after it.
It probably went to the greenhouse.
We'll start there.
Meantime, stay here.
Watch the door into the hallway.
Keep your eye on the Geiger counter.
- Here are the fire extinguishers.
Who's your electrical expert?
- That's my line.
Can you hook into the intercom system?
- We can take one from any room.
I can help.
- Mac, we'll be in the radio room.
Let us know when you're ready.
You all right?
Yeah. I'd like to tag along.
- Haven't you had enough?
If I start burning up again, who'll put out the fire?
We're very proud of our captain.
Now, look, put one of the intercoms here. That'll take care of this end.
Put another down here at the junction.
See if they work through the mess hall.
You said you were gonna use kerosene again.
Know anything better?
- Something hotter. Why not use electricity?
You mean your lighting system?
- No, we can hook in a new transformer.
It will give us plenty of amps.
- Enough to burn him?
More than enough.
- Could you use leads to two poles?
If you insulate the poles.
- Sounds good.
Bob, give him a hand.
Come on, Tex. You go to work.
Get Anchorage if you can.
Tell them the whole story.
Tell them we're in bad shape and to bring hand grenades, mortars...
...flamethrowers, anything.
Tell them if I don't send a story,
I'm gonna shoot myself.
Better comb your hair first.
- What hair?
Hey, say that again.
- Oh, Nikki, not you too.
He's sensitive.
- You too.
I got hair.
- Doesn't make you prettier.
No, your breath.
- I'm sorry.
He's sensitive about that too.
- I've been upset.
You ninnies. Look. That's what I mean.
- Hey, look. You too.
It's getting cold.
- The heat must be off.
It is off.
It's not getting oil.
See if it's the same across the hall.
Tex, where do these heaters get oil?
- Around behind. Outside.
Pat, heat's off in the mess hall!
- No.
No more oil coming in.
- It's off in there too.
Could the tank be empty?
- Filled day before yesterday.
The main line could be plugged.
Better fix it.
Probably run into our visitor, who'd be waiting for you.
We underestimate this guy.
Trying to freeze us out, huh?
- That isn't gonna be hard.
It's down to 40 degrees.
- It's 60 below outside.
How long will these rooms hold heat?
- Half an hour.
By then, we'll be stiff.
- If no one goes out...
...won't it think of something else?
It'll think that our only chance to keep warm is electricity. Heaters, blankets.
It could break the circuit, cut a line, except at the source.
The generator room.
- Get them all in there.
I'll tell Tex.
- Bring food, medicine, blankets, clothes.
Bring our flying clothes.
- Most got burned. I'll see what I can salvage.
Get the transformer hooked up to that.
- It's cold in here.
The thing's turned the heat off.
- What?
What'll we do?
- I don't know.
The next thing's electricity, so everybody's in the generator room.
Did you do a good job on the outside door?
Houdini'd find it tough getting in.
- He'll come through here.
It's the only way. Got any fence wire strong enough for the voltage?
Whole rolls of it.
- That'll work.
What?
- Lay it on the ground.
A lead overhead and on each side.
When it gets to the spot, juice him.
I don't get you.
- Where's the wire?
Down here.
- Give me those.
What are you doing?
- We'll rig an electric flytrap for him.
What do you mean?
Scotty, get me a hammer and nails.
- Sure.
Better get out of the way.
Looks as if the situation's well in hand.
- I've given all the orders I'm gonna give.
If I thought that were true,
I'd ask you to marry me. Here's your coat.
I wanna keep my mind open.
Hammer and nails.
- Down there.
Where do you want us?
- In the generator room. Move along.
Sorry, changed my mind. It's all off.
- Keep moving, everybody.
I want another word with you.
- No time now. Move along.
Make way. Clear this out.
Clear this place.
Where are those cutters?
- Here.
Where's your Geiger counter?
- I got one too.
Go to the assembly room.
If you get anything, come running.
Get me a pair of gloves.
- Use mine.
Leave enough to hook the overhead wire.
- Got plenty.
Here we are, lieutenant.
- Yeah, that ought to give us a ground.
There she is, captain.
- Down to five degrees now.
Perfect for skiing.
- Better get rubber boots, Scotty.
Why?
- Insulation when they turn the juice on.
Oh, yeah.
- There's a pair back here.
Where?
- Wait. You won't need any boots.
When it comes, go back.
You don't belong out here.
I didn't belong at Alamein or Okinawa.
I was just kibitzing.
I also write a very good obituary.
Just ignore me, please.
Capt. Hendry.
- Go ahead.
Just hooked this up.
Checking if it works.
Fine. Watch your Geiger counter.
Mac, did you hear?
- Every word. I hope that's all I hear.
So do I.
- Here's another message from Washington.
'Use every means to protect lives, but take no steps against your prisoner.'
Our prisoner.
You can't ignore orders.
- Testify to that at my court-martial.
You're robbing science of the greatest secret that's ever come to it.
Go back.
- Knowledge is more important than life.
We've only one excuse for existing.
To think. To find out. To learn.
What can we learn from that, except a way to die?
It doesn't matter what happens.
Nothing counts except our thinking.
We fought into nature.
We've split the atom...
That sure made the world happy.
Didn't it?
We owe it to the brain of our species to stand here and die...
...without destroying a source of wisdom.
- Capt. Hendry.
Civilization has given us orders.
- Get him out of here.
Oh, you fools. You'll never hurt it.
Go ahead.
- I'm getting a Geiger counter reaction.
What's your reading?
- Point two, but steady.
Watch it. Tell us any change.
Mac, anything your way?
Not a glimmer.
- Watch it.
Here's the operating switch.
How can it get cold so quick?
- Keep moving around.
It must be zero.
- It was. Next stop, five below.
Come on, Mr. Martian, and get some nice Scotch blood. One hundred proof.
Nothing like it for babies.
- Tell him to cut it out.
No, no. Let him go on. I like goose pimples. They keep me warm.
Did you get a picture of that thing on fire?
No. I shot one while I was falling backward over the bed.
Probably got the ceiling and my big feet.
Capt. Hendry, going up a little.
Point four now.
Hang on. Mac, any change?
- Just the same. Only colder.
Means he's coming by the mess hall.
- Excuse me. I got an idea.
What?
- Here we go again.
Your boy's pretty smart. He might see these wires and think it over.
Yeah.
- If he thinks too long, we're cold meat.
What if we met him by the junction?
- Let him see us there and chase us?
The less light, the better.
Turn off this light and this one here.
Don't tell me I'm right.
Capt. Hendry, going up.
Point eight now.
I'm getting some too.
- It's showing here.
Both of you, back here. Come running.
- Halfway there.
If you speed up that generator, can you get more out?
Certainly do no harm to try.
- Bill and Tex, go with him. Nikki too.
No.
- Good luck to you.
What's the matter?
I was wishing we'd tested this thing.
- What if we haven't enough voltage?
Keep swinging at its arms.
- One point two.
It's on its way.
- I got a worry.
Report from the front,
McPherson has a worry.
This is no joke.
- What?
What if he can read our minds?
- He'll be mad when he gets to me.
One point four.
- Keep moving around, you guys.
Keep it quiet.
I remember the first execution I ever covered. Ruth Snyder and Judd Grey.
Did you get a picture?
- No. They didn't allow cameras.
One point six and going up.
- Don't move till he sees us.
Give him a chance to look.
Leave me room to reach that switch.
Stay away from the walls when he hits the juice.
Everybody got rubber boots on?
- Yes, sir.
One point eight.
I heard something.
It's getting near the top.
Get your posts!
All right. Ease back.
What the...?
- The juice is off!
Carrington's turned off the generator.
Bob, bring a flashlight. Eddie, hold him off as long as you can.
Watch out. He's got a gun.
- Keep away. Keep away.
Keep away. I won't allow you to destroy...
Turn on that generator!
Get back here, Eddie.
Eddie, get back!
Stay away from that wire!
I'm your friend. I have no weapons.
I'm your friend.
You're wiser than I. You must understand what I'm trying to tell you.
Don't go farther. They'll kill you.
They think you'll harm us.
But I want to know you, to help you. Believe that.
You're wiser than anything on earth.
Use that intelligence. Look and know what I'm telling you.
I'm not your enemy.
I'm a scientist who's trying...
Hold it.
Wait until he gets right in the middle of it, sir.
He's gotta be on that walk, captain.
Wait till he gets right in the middle, sir.
Oh, that's it. Stop. Turn it off.
- Let it go. We don't want any part left.
Well, you can get a picture now, Scotty.
This will take a minute to warm up.
- Okay.
Is there any reason now why I can't send my story?
Only take five minutes.
- I guess it's okay.
You're looking better to me than you used to.
All done, Pat.
- Get everything?
Burned everything in Carrington's lab and the greenhouse.
Burned the arm too.
- How is Dr. Carrington?
He's got a broken collarbone and a headache.
I'm not getting enough voltage.
I'll check the generator for you.
- Good.
Anybody want some coffee?
- No, but you can come in.
You better have some. You look tired.
- He should look tired.
He's had two things on his mind.
- We've only had one.
Our worries are over, while our captain...
- Shut up.
Isn't there something you can do about it, Nikki?
I don't know. You know, I'm getting pretty fed up with the North Pole.
How much does a captain make?
- Not much.
That's a good start. Go ahead.
Enough to support two?
- Not nearly.
Captain, you get flight pay.
- Some for each dependent.
We can handle that.
- I won't be railroaded into anything.
I've got an idea.
This is gonna work.
- You ought to settle down.
There you are.
- It'd be much better for us.
Sure. Our captain always getting into trouble.
Remember that night in Honolulu?
- That was pretty bad.
I don't know what they're talking about.
- He should light somewhere.
See, they know what's best for you.
- Here we are. Plenty of voltage now.
Anchorage, from Polar Expedition 6.
Can you hear me? Over.
Anchorage, reception clear. Stand by.
- Press the button and speak, Scotty.
Tell General Fogarty we've sent for
Capt. Hendry. He'll be here in minutes.
Roger. Over.
- Are there any newsmen there? Over.
The place is full of them. Over.
- All right. Here's your story.
North Pole, November 3rd.
Ned Scott reporting.
One of the world's greatest battles was fought and won by the human race.
A handful of American soldiers and civilians...
...met the first invasion from another planet.
A man by the name of Noah once saved our world with an ark of wood.
Here, a few men performed a similar service with an arc of electricity.
A flying saucer, which landed here, and its pilot have been destroyed.
But not without casualties among our own meager forces.
I'd like to bring to the microphone the men responsible for our success.
But Capt. Hendry is attending to demands over and above the call of duty.
Dr. Carrington, leader of the scientific expedition...
...is recovering from wounds from the battle.
- Good for you.
And now, before giving you the details of the battle, I bring you a warning.
Every one of you listening to my voice...
...tell the world. Tell this to everybody wherever they are:
Watch the skies everywhere.
Keep looking. Keep watching the skies.
But not without casualties among our own meager forces.

All hail beloved alma mater
Steadfast and loyal we will be
This is the greatest thing that ever happened to me.
How did I ever graduate?
I slipped the guy 20 bucks.
Now, keep quiet.
...Dugan's Detective Training
And now we graduate from Dugan's
Experts in criminology
And since they say that crime won't pay
We will fight crime with good old DDT
Men, I have taught you all I know.
You've studied hard and learned well.
Well, most of you.
You have earned the Dugan
Detective Training diploma.
And the DDT diploma on an office wall means a steady stream of clients.
Bud Alexander.
In accordance with my agreement with the students who graduate, you will receive a trial with a recognized detective agency.
Report to the MacQuillan Agency in the Fort Building.
- Give him this card.
- Thank you.
Louis Francis.
Thank you.
Thank you!
You've been seeing too many
Sherlock Holmes pictures lately.
Take off that cap.
A detective has to dress so he won't attract much attention.
Come on, put that down.
That is not a lollipop.
Look, turn on the police calls.
Hurry up.
It might tip us off to something.
I'm glad MacQuillan gave us the night shift.
Maybe we can grab a case and solve it ourselves.
Hey, just imagine, Lou.
We get a tip on a bank robbery.
Better yet, a murder.
And we follow the murderer to his hideout.
Yeah.
And then we go to his hideout, and then we start searching the place.
Yes, but remember, death lurks in every corner.
And, suddenly, the murderer comes in.
Fellows, interested in a case?
- A case?
- A case of what?
Shh! Quiet. Yes, yes.
You want us to handle a case?
Yeah.
Which one of you is MacQuillan?
- I am.
- I am.
- Who's who?
- He's Mac, I'm Quillan.
- You can just call us Bud and Lou.
- Both of us.
Attention, all cars and stations.
Be on the lookout for Tommy Nelson, escaped murderer.
He is 5'11", weighs 165, blue eyes, brown hair.
When last seen, was wearing dark felt hat, overcoat.
Nelson?
Isn't that the middleweight who killed his manager after his last fight?
That's what they said.
You know, if we weren't taking your case,
I'd grab that murderer.
Excuse me. I don't think you have to look very far.
Keep quiet. I've got to mark down his description,
5'10", weight 165, blue eyes, sandy hair.
Put down,
"Turned up collar and soft hat."
Quiet. The man wants a telephone.
Bud, if that ain't Tommy Nelson, it's Frankenstein.
Frankenstein!
Hello, Helen?
Is anyone around?
Good.
I must see the doctor at once.
I'll be right over.
There's money in this for you fellas.
- How much?
- Plenty.
Take me to 823 Maple Street and I'll tell you all about it.
Let's go.
- That's him.
- Who?
- Tommy Nelson.
- Oh, I'd love to get my hands on him.
Come on, let's go.
- I can't see a thing.
- Turn it around.
Bud, look!
What?
It's only a moth!
Come on.
Tommy, I've been so worried.
I want to see the doctor right away.
You fellas wait in the library over there.
I'll be right back.
Excuse me.
Hey, she called him Tommy.
That's Tommy Nelson, the escaped killer.
Stop jumping at conclusions.
What would an escaped killer want two private detectives for?
- So he can catch himself?
- So he... Come on.
Tommy.
Is this wise?
The police know about you and Helen.
This is the first place they'll look.
And those men you brought with you...
It was my only way of getting here.
But can you trust them, Tommy?
If you'd brought me the serum while I was in jail,
I wouldn't need to trust anybody.
What did happen?
Did you make up your minds that maybe I killed O'Hara after all?
That's not fair, Tommy.
Uncle Phil has been working day and night on the formula.
- You told me you had it developed.
- I do, my boy.
You can see for yourself.
Pripitane serum was discovered years ago, and it works.
One injection, and the cell structure becomes transparent.
Well, what are you waiting for?
Come on, jab me with one of those needles, and the police will never catch me.
Then I'll be free to find out who really killed O'Hara.
And inside of a week, you'd be a raving maniac.
That's what the formula did to its discoverer, John Griffin.
No.
I've got to take that chance.
Do you want to go insane, as John Griffin did?
You want to be shot down like a mad dog as he was?
He never regained his visibility until he was dead.
When he willed me this formula,
I swore I'd never use it until
I'd found some safe reagent, some means of bringing a man back in time, some method of avoiding insanity, perhaps even restoring visibility.
But, Doc, I can't wait.
Unless I clear myself, it means the chair.
So what difference does it make?
Come on. Come on. Attaboy.
Come on, you can make it.
- Boy, did you see that?
- What happened?
- What happened?
- Yeah.
The halfback just ran around his own end.
Some trick.
We interrupt our program to give you a police bulletin.
Have you seen this man?
He's Tommy Nelson, escaped murderer.
There's a $5,000 reward for his capture.
If you have any information, phone River...
- What number?
- ...8181.
- Thank you.
- Hey, you're absolutely right.
This guy is the killer.
- Let's get outta here. Come on.
- No, you can't go now.
We've got a great case.
We'll grab the murderer and get the reward.
We can't do that.
- This guy hired you and I...
- Now, wait a minute. Just a minute.
Nevertheless, he's a rat.
- Because he killed his fight manager?
- No.
Because he didn't tell us there was a reward for him.
I'm sorry, Tommy.
I can't do it.
- It's the police.
- Come on.
Let's sneak out the back way, and they can't catch us.
Good. Come on, let's go.
Hey, wait a minute.
We're detectives.
What am I running for?
- Am I a crook?
- You want me to answer that?
Tommy, it's the police.
Stall them off, and I'll try to get out the back way.
All right, men, take your positions.
It's a legal search warrant, my dear.
But it's perfectly ridiculous.
I've been ridiculous before, beautiful.
Roy, you and I will take the upstairs.
Joe, you cover the back.
Eddie, you stay right here.
We've got to catch Nelson before the cops do and collect that reward.
I'll watch out in the hall and you watch here.
No, you ain't gonna do that to me now.
All right, then you watch here and I'll watch out in the hall.
Okay.
That's the same thing!
Hey, we've got him.
He can't get away.
Look, now...
Bud! Bud!
Don't worry, he can't get out.
Neither can I!
Bud!
Mr. Nelson, I don't want the reward.
I'm for you.
Let's shake hands on it.
Attaboy.
Don't forget, we get the reward.
My pal's got him covered.
That boy is always on his toes.
Well, where is he?
- Always on his toes, huh?
- Give me a lift.
Come on, Lou.
Snap out of it.
- Come on, boy.
- Here, I'll give him a whiff of this.
What happened?
Bud. I want to tell you something, Bud.
- Here's Bud. Over here.
- Hiya, Bud.
Come here.
Where did Tommy Nelson go?
- Where did he go?
- He disappeared.
- Well, how did he get out of here?
- In installments.
- Installments?
- Yeah, he did a Gypsy Rose Lee.
That's all that's left of him.
Well, evidently
Nelson changed clothes.
What was he wearing the last time you saw him?
Air.
Nothing but air.
And then he asked me how he looked.
Wearing air?
What are you talking about?
He was standing right here, and then I shook hands with him.
His hand was gone.
Then I went to speak to him, his head was gone.
Then he took off his shirt, his body was gone.
He took off his pants, his legs were gone.
- Then he spoke to me.
- Yeah?
I was gone.
This guy's a psycho if I've ever seen one.
Now, would you mind coming to the police station and telling a real nice man just what you told us?
- Don't you believe what I saw?
- Sure I do.
Why, things like this happen every day.
They do?
Where have I been?
I don't know where you've been, but I know where you're going.
So you let him get away.
Now we can't collect the $5,000 reward.
Double-crosser!
You kicked me.
And what's the idea of calling me a double-crosser?
That wasn't me, that was him.
That was him.
Now, don't lie!
Ow. Ow!
Come on, now, boys.
Break it up. Break it up!
Now, don't keep the nice man waiting.
Come on.
I know. I know.
You saw this man disappear into space.
That's right.
- Do you always see things?
- Only when my eyes are open.
And have you ever seen anyone disappear before?
Yes, sir.
My brother.
Uh-huh. This may have been the start of this complex, seeing things.
Tell me about it.
Well, my brother and I, we were walking down the street.
- All of a sudden, he disappeared.
- Into thin air?
No, into a manhole.
How about voices?
Do you ever hear strange voices coming out of the air?
Yes, sir.
Uh-huh.
When does this happen?
When I get the wrong number on the telephone.
Got a headache?
Suppose you go over there and lie down?
Why? Don't you believe me, sitting here?
- Would you get over there, please?
- All right.
Here, lie down.
Perhaps we can find out something from your subconscious mind.
- Now, tell me, what's wrong with me?
- Well, you see...
Would you get down there?
Often the conscious mind will lie, but from the subconscious, we get the truth.
You know where the subconscious mind comes from?
The subway?
Now, look into my eyes.
You're going to sleep.
You're going to sleep.
- Sleep. Sleep.
- One, two, three, four, five, six...
- What are you doing?
- I'm counting cows.
- Cows?
- I'm allergic to sheep.
Sleep. Sleep.
Sleep.
- And now you are asleep.
- I am?
Come, come.
You must go to sleep.
We must find out why you are seeing things.
Here. Now, watch this.
Concentrate on this.
Tick-tock.
Tick-tock, tick-tock.
You forgot to say,
"The mouse ran up the clock."
But, you've got to go to sleep!
I can't, I'm too busy looking at this clock.
But you must concentrate on that.
We've got to help you.
We've got to make you better.
But first, we've got to find out what causes these things.
We must find out...
- What's with that psycho?
- Nothing yet.
- Well, find out what's cooking.
- Okay.
Wake up, will you, please?
Wake up. Please wake up.
Will you please wake up?
- Hey, what's happened here?
- I don't know.
He was trying to put me to sleep with this watch, like this here.
He kept saying,
"Sleep. Sleep. Sleep."
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock.
You see, officer?
I was...
Where's your head?
Wonder what the doc is doing here so late.
Somebody's gotta be there.
You think anything happened to him?
I hope so.
Come on, we'll find out.
Oh, why don't you all get up?
Hey, Doc, will you help me to get them up?
Come on.
Will you get up, fellas?
Doc! Doc!
What's the matter?
What's happened?
What happened? You were trying to put me to sleep with your watch.
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick...
Oh, no.
Give me that watch.
Get out of here.
- Get out of here!
- Take it easy.
Doc, did you find out anything?
Yes, once before, he saw his brother disappear.
- Into thin air?
- No, into a sewer!
A fine detective you are.
You not only messed up our first case, but you proved to the cops that you're a moron.
I did not. They did.
I didn't mean to frighten you.
I have a message from Tommy.
He wants you to prove that he's innocent.
- I have a $500 retainer for you.
- Five hundred bucks?
You're to take this grip to the south end of Riverside Park.
You know, that deeply wooded section.
Leave the grip there, and Tommy will contact you.
Here's the $500.
We'll get in touch with you at your house.
Any messages for Tommy?
Oh, yes. Tell Tommy my uncle is working on the reagent.
Thanks for the $500.
Well, that's that.
Now all we...
So!
He's invisible, eh?
Then why take clothes to him?
Hey, wait a minute.
What are you two cooking up on me?
What did this guy give you to escape?
Come on.
Don't lie to me.
Uh-huh, just as I thought.
Well, you'll get no parts of this $500 or the $500the dame gave me.
That'll teach you to be honest, someday or other. Well...
Oh... Yeah?
No, you don't.
No, you don't.
Now, you leave that alone!
Touch that again,
I'll break both of your arms.
You take this grip...
I told you not to touch it, didn't I?
Now, give me that bill.
I said put it there and leave it there.
That's better. Now you...
Give me that bill.
Give me your hand.
Put it in my hand like that and leave it there.
Now, take this grip here, take it down there to the car, and I'll be right with you.
Hurry up.
Wise guy.
Hello, operator?
Give me police headquarters.
Tommy? Tommy?
Here's your grip, Tommy.
Was he in there?
Yeah, he was unpacking and I'm packing.
What are you talking about?
What did you see?
An empty woods, full of Tommy Nelson.
Now, don't give me that invisible stuff again.
Honest.
And there were footsteps with no feet.
And a grip that was unpacking itself.
All right, boys, let's go.
Hey, that's some disguise, Tommy.
The cops will never recognize you.
I'm not gonna get near any cops.
And I'm counting on you guys to help me.
Oh, you can trust me.
Tommy.
You can trust me, too, Tommy.
Thanks.
Let's shake on it.
Uh...
Come on, let's get out of here.
If I'd known it was you that phoned,
I wouldn't have come.
Now, if this is a wild goose chase...
There happens to be a sitting duck right in my car.
Now, you bag him and I'll bag the reward.
I'm not interested in the reward.
I want Tommy Nelson!
I got the keys in my pocket.
Tommy, don't get excited.
I mean, after all, there's no use you losing your head.
'Course, I mean...
Oh, Tommy.
Not again.
All right, Tommy, come out with your hands up.
What? You again?
I knew you'd do something like this.
What did I tell you?
Take me to the station!
Are you gonna see that nice man again?
Yes, and I'm gonna have my head examined.
Lieutenant, I'm sure I saw another man in the car when we drove up.
Then I'll have your head examined, too. Come on.
- Well, what's your alibi now?
- He did it again.
And you did it again, after me phoning the cops to be here.
You...
And you did that again.
Now, don't be smart.
I told you not to get smart, didn't I?
Now, I'll show you who is the boss.
No, I'll show you who's boss.
Who said that?
The voice is familiar, but I can't quite place the face.
You brought the cops here, so you tried to double-cross me again.
Oh, no, it's Tommy Nelson.
Lou, he's here!
I touched him.
I think he touched you back.
Listen, you two, if either of you ever cross me again,
I'll break every bone in your bodies.
Tommy, I didn't do anything.
Don't give me excuses.
Get in the car.
- Okay.
- Yes, sir.
- Not in the front, in the back.
- Yes, sir.
Give me the keys.
Hurry, the keys!
Fine pal you are.
Stand there and watch me get beat up.
Bud, believe me,
I didn't see a thing.
Yeah.
Boy, I sure scared that guy.
Say, Tommy, if we get in an accident, do you bleed, too?
Mr. Nelson,
I want to apologize.
Okay, from now on, we'll work together.
Say, Tommy, you didn't kill your fight manager, did you?
The evidence says I did.
When I stepped out of the shower that night,
I found O'Hara on the dressing room floor, beaten to death.
The officer at the door swore no one else had entered the room.
So, they hung it on me.
We believe you,
Tommy.
Uh, Mr. Nelson,
I forgot to tell you that Miss Gray said her uncle is working on the reagent.
That's fine.
Without it, I could become a raving maniac with an uncontrollable urge to kill.
You ain't kidding.
I hope he's got his driver's license.
I hope he's in the car.
Pull over to the side.
Tell him.
He's driving.
I said, pull over to the...
Now, tell it to me again.
But I've told you three times.
Well, tell him again.
I saw a car with nobody driving somebody.
Sorry, Tommy, I didn't know you was behind me.
Hey, what are you doing?
Rowing. I gotta be at Staten Island in 20 minutes.
You better hurry.
The tide's going out.
Now, in preparation for his fight with young Malloy, the leading contender for the middleweight crown, the East Side's favorite son,
Rocky Hanlon.
He couldn't lick Tommy Nelson.
- So, that's Rocky Hanlon, huh?
- Yeah.
The night I fought him, my manager O'Hara and a gambler named Morgan made a deal for me to take a dive.
I crossed them and knocked Rocky out in the second round.
- So, that's why they killed your manager.
- Yeah.
And that announcer there, it was Stillwell.
He runs this place.
Look, I need you guys around the gym to help me out.
So, tell him you'd like to train here.
You leave it to me, Tommy.
Mr. Stillwell.
In close, Rocky.
Watch that jab. That's it.
Keep putting 'em in there.
Keep that left up.
Keep him working.
Look, Morgan, the Colonel's down front.
It ain't smart if it gets around that you own Rocky.
I know what I'm doing.
This fight will put us all in the blue chips.
Yeah. That's what you said before Rocky fought Tommy Nelson.
Well, this time there'll be no slip-up.
Malloy dives in the sixth round.
- Does his manager understand that?
- I keep asking him if he does.
Keep asking him if he knows what happened to O'Hara.
Beat it.
Uh... He don't look like much of a fighter to me, but you can train him here as long as you pay me.
- Thanks.
- Yeah.
In case a substitute is needed on a fight card, should I give him a bout?
- Sure, give him a bout.
- Yeah. Okay.
Give me a bout?
Yeah. Give me about 20 minutes to get out of town.
Now, now, listen.
We told him you were a fighter.
- You've gotta live up to the name.
- Bud, you know I'm no fighter.
- Oh, what's the difference?
- Look, watch this.
- Tommy, you here?
- Yeah, this is our first move.
Now, stick close to that bag, and I'll do the rest.
I've never seen anything like him.
Why, the little guy's wonderful.
Hey, you're missing the greatest exhibition
I've ever seen.
Look!
- Stay down. Stay down. Stay down.
- Come on.
Great stuff, fella.
You punch a bag just like Tommy Nelson.
That's what
I've been telling myself.
- Hey, Steve, get a picture of this fella.
- Wait a minute.
I made 40 grand last year.
What was your take?
- About 10% of that.
- Well, then pay attention to me.
Hey, you, make with the camera.
Bud, he's ready to blow up.
Start working on him.
Hey, just a minute, chum.
This butterball could smear you all over the map.
Bud, don't say that.
And I'll repeat it.
He can smear you all over the map.
That's it.
Steam him up, Bud.
And while he's doing that, what do you think
I'll be doing?
- Smearing my map all over the place.
- You said it.
- Now, both of you, shove off.
- Shove off?
That's sailor talk.
Yeah, like taking a dive.
Listen, nobody has to take a dive for me.
I can whip anybody my weight.
That includes you!
Bud, let him smear your map all over the place.
So, now you wanna fight me?
Well, if you're looking for a fight,
I'll give you one.
- Lou, take a poke at him.
- Me?
Yes, you. Do you want him to think
I'm a coward?
Look, I'll fight the two of you.
- You couldn't even lick him.
- Oh, yes, he could.
Now, wait a minute.
Take a punch at him. I dare you.
- I double dare you!
- Stop coaxing him!
- What a slugger!
- I couldn't even see the punch.
- It was a right cross.
- No, it was an uppercut.
Say, what punch did you use?
It was sort of a half Nelson, maybe a whole Nelson.
What's your name?
Louie Francis.
- Louie Francis?
- Mmm-hmm.
"Louie the Looper."
What a story.
- Where have you fought?
- Well, I...
- Tell them something.
- Okay, Tommy.
Listen, I haven't had a fight since I went to school.
- Well, say something.
- Okay.
I can remember the classes, but I can't sort of remember the names.
Let me see.
Yes. I licked Chucky LeMange in the fourth and Chuck Grant in the sixth.
And the teacher licked me in the eighth.
- The teacher?
- He means his trainer.
- Are you his manager?
- Sure.
Would you consider a fight between your boy and Rocky Hanlon?
Yes.
What are you talking about?
Rocky fights young Malloy next week.
That's right,
I'm fighting Malloy next week.
Sure, Rocky's fighting
Malloy next week.
Not after the story
I'm writing.
A Hanlon-Malloy waltz wouldn't draw flies.
Attention, sports fans.
My first exclusive.
The Rocky Hanlon/Louie the Looper fight is set.
And I say, watch this boy,
Louie the Looper.
His looks are deceiving, but there's no denying his punching ability.
I was the first to recognize Joe Louis.
And in studying Louie the Looper's deceptive style, half Tony Galento, half Benny Leonard,
I say, watch this boy.
I'll call.
- What have you got, Lou?
- Pair of jacks.
- And you, Bud?
- Queen's up.
No good.
Three 10s, you lose.
Tommy, you are the luckiest guy.
Say, Tommy, what's the idea of us living in this high-class gyp joint?
For the benefit of our gambling friend, Morgan.
Hmm.
Cut the cards.
What's the matter?
Don't you trust me?
How do you like that?
I think somebody's cheating.
You can say that again.
Ante.
- What are you doing?
- Well, you gotta ante, Tommy.
Okay,
I'm dealing.
By the way, Tommy, what is your plan?
Well, Morgan will hear that you guys are a couple of free spenders, see?
And figure you can be reached.
He'll make a contact, and we'll lead him on.
Then, the night of the fight...
Tommy, do I have to go into the ring with Rocky Hanlon?
What are you worrying about?
I'll be in there with you every minute.
I'm dying to take a crack at Rocky.
And I'll be in there just dying.
I open.
I'll stay.
Cards?
One.
Give me two.
One, two, three.
I bet.
I'll raise your bet.
I'll raise you.
Hmm-hmm.
I see that, and I raise you.
Now that's me out.
I raise again.
What are you doing?
I wanna make sure you're not peeking.
Oh, Miss Gray.
- Is Tommy here?
- Yes. Please come in.
Tommy, Helen is here.
Hello, Helen.
Tommy.
Oh.
We oughta hang a bell around this boy's neck.
Maybe he's inside changing his clothes.
Clothes? What clothes?
I'll be right out, Helen.
Lou. I guess you two want to be alone.
No, Bud, not Helen and me.
Helen and Tommy.
Ah, come on.
- Goodbye, Helen.
- Goodbye...
- I still think somebody's cheating.
- Come on.
Helen, you shouldn't have come here.
You may have been followed, and the police could spoil my plans.
I'm sorry, dear.
I've been so worried.
Last night, there was fog.
And in fog or smoke, they can see you.
I'll be careful, so don't worry.
It isn't only that, Tommy.
My uncle is worried, too, about the...
About the effect of the drug on my mind?
Well, tell him I never thought more clearly in my life.
I've never felt so free.
Invisibility gives me a sense of power, for good or for evil.
Tommy, that feeling of power, it might be a symptom.
- Please come back to the laboratory.
- I can't.
I must have time to clear myself.
Another day, a week at the most.
Then your uncle can try whatever he wants.
All right, Tommy.
But for my sake, please be careful.
I will.
Goodbye, boys.
- Goodbye, Miss Gray.
- Goodbye, Helen.
If he starts acting strangely, call me.
If he starts acting strangely,
I won't be able to open up my mouth.
We'll call you if anything happens.
- Thanks. Goodbye.
- You're welcome.
- Where are we going?
- To the Bubble Room.
That's Morgan's hangout.
And the quicker you meet Morgan, the quicker we'll get action, and I crave action.
- Who is it?
- Detective Roberts.
Tommy, you craved action.
Well, you're gonna get it.
Come on, get out of here.
Just a minute,
Detective Roberts.
Yeah.
Now, you stand there.
He won't be able to see you.
On your knees.
On your knees!
Attaboy.
- What can we do for you?
- Nothing. Nothing at all.
I just wanted to check up on what you've seen today.
Are you still seeing men disappear into thin air?
Or is today flying saucer day?
This guy needs a pie-chiatrist.
What I need is information, and I want it quick.
I trailed
Nelson's girl here, and I know she didn't come to see you two guys.
Now, where's Nelson?
You can believe me.
I have not seen him since last night.
That goes for me, too.
Oh, so, you haven't seen him, huh?
Okay, Nelson, get your hands up!
What...
What's this?
My laundry.
I'm sending it out.
Your laundry!
Don't forget to say hello to that nice man with the watch.
Tommy? Tommy?
The glass belongs here.
Tommy, it's not polite to make noise when you eat.
But, I'm starved.
I'll have the lamb chop luncheon.
Yes, sir.
- I know what I want. Spaghetti.
- And a steak.
What do you want?
- Spaghetti.
- And a steak.
You said you knew what you wanted.
Do you want spaghetti or steak?
I'll have a spaghetti and a steak.
Yes, sir.
I used to be a juggler.
Many, many... In the time...
You care for anything else, sir?
Uh, um... Yeah, yes.
You can get me that swell-looking dish there for a side order.
Waiter, bring two dishes.
I want to go halfies.
That's Boots Marsden.
I had a hunch she was tied up with Morgan.
But he doesn't even look like a fighter.
He's fat and short.
So, he won't have so far to fall when he takes a dive.
Start working, baby.
Hey, she's coming this way.
I must have caught her eye.
May I join you?
Sure, sure.
Sit here, Miss Marsden.
Move over.
Move over.
I hope you don't get the wrong impression of me, but I have two good reasons for wanting to meet you.
The first one is, when I read what Louie the Looper did to Rocky Hanlon,
I said to myself,
"There's a man."
That's the first time anybody ever said that about me.
And the second reason?
I'm a woman.
That's even better than the first one.
How about a little drink?
No, thank you.
Not here.
I like privacy.
There's nothing like wearing something comfortable and turning the lights down low and having a nice cool drink with a nice warm person.
Yeah, but my place at the Carlton Towers is overcrowded.
The Carlton Towers?
Now, isn't that a coincidence or fate or something?
I live at the Carlton Towers, too.
Hey, that's great.
I live there, too.
I hope you like your room.
I'll be home all evening.
Boots, Boots, Boots.
Shut up. You sound like Gunga Din.
Morgan's made his first move.
Tonight he'll make his second.
Or I should say, she will.
Boots, spaghetti.
What a combination.
What are you stuffing in your mouth?
No.
- Bud.
- What's the matter?
I don't wanna do this.
Now, listen. All we're trying to do is prove that Tommy was framed.
You see this recording machine here?
All you've to do is start it.
Then we'll get a record of what she says.
And then you'll have a record of what I say.
No, come here.
Listen, all you have to do is lead her on.
Come in.
Good evening.
Good night.
What did you say good night for?
I think she's getting ready to go to bed.
So...
- Come in, Louie.
- Oh...
You shouldn't have done that.
I know, I'm just a little squirt.
Flowers? For me?
Yes, ma'am.
How thoughtful. Put them over there on the table.
Mmm-hmm.
I just love flowers.
They're like true friends.
They see so much and hear so much and yet they never talk.
It sure would surprise people, if they did.
Don't move.
Stand where you are.
I'm caught.
I didn't mean anything.
Don't talk.
That light on your profile, it shows your iron will, your rugged individuality, your indomitable courage.
Oh, darling. I always want to see you the way you are now.
It's your looks
I'm worried about.
Not that you can't beat Rocky, but one lucky punch from him could ruin that profile.
And then I'd lose all interest.
You mean, you wouldn't like me if I wasn't pretty?
Of course, I mean it.
When it's so unnecessary.
There's more money to be made losing a fight than winning one.
All you have to do is agree to get knocked out.
You can even name the round.
First round?
Mmm-mmm.
Second round?
Mmm-mmm.
Third round?
How many rounds can you last?
Suppose you agree to three rounds.
Then some nice friend will deposit a lot of money in the bank for you.
How am I gonna know the nice man that's gonna put the money in the bank?
Maybe I can arrange a meeting.
I'll phone, but remember, all of this is off the record.
Louie.
Everything's set.
We're to go to the Bubble Room.
Oh, Louie, you won't regret this.
Oh, Boots, let's fight another round.
What was that noise?
That's off the record.
Tommy, please listen.
He must be made to realize the danger of his mental condition.
Tommy, the doctor is afraid.
Afraid?
Afraid of what?
That he'll never find the reagent?
That I'll never be visible again?
Well, tell him not to worry.
I feel...
I feel much better this way.
No one can touch me, not even the cops.
That makes me a nemesis.
It makes me a dictator.
Tommy, please, Tommy.
Take it easy.
Hello, he's all right, Helen.
I'll take care of him.
He's just a little drunkey.
Sure, sure, I'm drunk.
Drunk with the power of invisibility.
I am the ruler of an invisible empire.
My loyal subjects I will reward.
My enemies I will destroy.
To be or not to be.
Alas, poor Yorick.
A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse.
Put that down.
Pour us a drink.
You...
You heard me.
Pour a drink.
Look. What's the matter with this one?
That one?
Yes, that one.
I'm a two-fisted drinker.
Put it in there.
Well, well, Boots Marsden and Louie the Looper.
Let's have a picture.
Help yourselves, boys.
Take a couple.
Hey, champ, how about a picture of you drinking champagne out of her slipper?
Why not?
Okay.
We'll call the picture,
"Puss in the Boots."
- Louie, what a sense of humor.
- Yeah.
Ready, folks?
Thanks.
Trying to be smart?
Don't fool with a buzz saw, mister.
This is Louie the Looper.
Oh. Okay, Louie.
Okay.
I'm sorry I spilled the champagne on you.
- Oh, that's nothing.
- Thank you.
Compared to the blood that
Rocky Hanlon's gonna spill all over you.
If you wasn't here,
I'd sock him.
- That's all right.
- I'm leaving now. I'll go with you.
You stay here. I just made contact with the money man.
Bud, I done everything you told me to do.
Well, that's swell.
Get off of me.
- I'm sorry, Tommy.
- Did you get the record?
I did. And very fast, too.
I broke a record.
When I hired you guys I thought
I was getting a couple of good detectives.
We may not be good detectives but we're very, very good friends.
- Friends.
- Excuse me.
Did it ever occur to you that friendship is, at its best, a rather doubtful asset?
I don't want friends.
I shall have followers, worshippers, people who will obey me because they realize my greatness.
To arms, to arms.
Four score and six...
- Seven.
- Five.
- Five, three, two...
- Three, two...
Would you put your hand down?
Tommy, if you don't pipe down, we'll all get into trouble.
And another thing.
You didn't give me a chance to tell you that Boots is contacting the money man.
Well, in that case, let's celebrate.
Pour us a drink, Lou.
No, Tommy. No.
Do you realize that every time you go into a saloon, the devil goes in with you?
Well, if he does, he pays for his own drink.
Excuse me.
This time we'll do things my way.
There's a lady present.
The Looper will get his dough the night of the fight.
Why don't you save your dough, boss?
That guy just got in a lucky punch at the gym.
I can take him.
Yeah, sure, sure.
Like you could take Nelson.
Only Nelson took you, and O'Hara took my money.
This time there'll be no slip-ups.
But he thinks he's going to meet you.
He is, if he tries to double-cross me.
Thank you.
Tommy, don't you think you've had enough?
Tommy, you shouldn't drink other people's drinks.
Oh, it's you again.
Now, wait a minute, just a minute.
Don't get excited, fella.
This happens to be
Louie the Looper.
I know, he's a buzz saw.
Well, here's where he's gonna lose a couple of teeth.
Why didn't you duck?
Duck? I didn't even see the punch coming.
Come on.
Let's get out of here.
Save your punches for tomorrow night, Looper.
You'll need them.
Let's have a nightcap.
Sure, Looper.
Tommy, you've had enough drinks.
Oh, is that so?
Yeah, that's so.
- Excuse me, sir.
- Don't mention it.
Oh, Tommy.
I'm only telling you for your own good.
Hey, Lou.
He's down there.
Tommy.
What are you doing with my drink?
Oh, I thought it was mine.
Oh, yeah. I've heard that one before.
Just a minute.
Bud, I'll handle this.
I'll take care of this myself.
Right, Tommy?
Go ahead and start something.
Double-crosser.
Hey. You hit my friend.
- Yeah, I hit him.
- Break it up, fellas.
The boss don't like no rough stuff.
You heard him.
Lou, Lou.
Come out of it, Lou.
Here, see if this'll help.
That didn't help him.
Tommy, we've got to get him out of here.
Here,
I'll give you a hand.
Come on.
Get a hold of him.
Come on. Take a hold of him,
Tommy. Attaboy, Tommy.
What happened?
Tommy got knocked out.
- That's funny. I thought it was me.
- Shut up.
He got knocked out by the revolving door.
He was hit on the head.
- Where is he?
- I don't know.
- We got to get him out of here.
- Tommy, Tommy.
- Tommy?
- Tommy.
Where is he?
Wait a minute. Pick him up.
Come on. Pick him up.
Attaboy. Pick him up.
Get in that door.
Hurry up.
Get in there!
I don't think
I'm gonna make it.
You'll make it.
Bring him over to me.
Fold him up.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
- Fold him. Fold him.
Get in there.
Get inside.
Now, tell it to me again.
I saw two men carrying no man.
Imagine my trying to solve this riddle in a week.
The harder I work, the more impossible it seems.
Tommy.
Hey, where am I?
You know,
I don't know.
You're home with me, darling.
Helen, baby.
Oh, it's good to see you.
It's good to...
To have you here with us, Tommy.
Us?
Oh. Hello, fellas.
Gee, I sure poured one on last night, didn't I?
You said it.
A king-sized one.
Boy, you were sure crazy...
What's the matter with you?
I was gonna tell him that he was great.
What'd you think
I was gonna say? Crazy?
He means about you trying to drink everybody's drinks last night.
Yeah.
I don't remember that.
I drank so much I don't remember seeing anybody.
We're even.
We didn't even see you.
But I do remember that deal with Boots Marsden.
Now, what about the money?
Well, we didn't have time to close the deal yet.
Well, get in touch with her. Close the deal.
Tell her you'll take the count any round she wants.
When we get into the ring with Rocky we double-cross Morgan and knock his boy cold.
Hey, this Morgan.
Is he mean?
- He's a killer.
- He's mean.
And if my hunch is right, he'll try to do what he did to O'Hara.
Bump Bud off and put the blame on you, Lou.
Fight postponed.
Don't worry, Lou.
As long as I'm in there with you, you're a cinch to win.
I'm gonna make sure of it.
Ew.
- What's that?
- Perfume.
If I can't see you, at least I'm gonna smell you.
Oh...
I'll show you out.
Doctor. Doctor!
Yes, Tommy?
I tried to sit up, but I'm paralyzed!
I can't move.
Take it easy, Tommy.
I have you strapped down.
It's just a precaution against a possible mental relapse.
But the fight tonight.
I'm sorry, Tommy, but I can't afford to take any chances.
You can't take any chances?
What about the chance I took?
Helen said you were afraid.
You're not afraid for me.
You're afraid for yourself.
Afraid of what the medical profession would do to you.
But you want to keep me chained up like a mad dog to save your good name, but you won't give me a chance to clear mine!
And now, sports fans, my prediction for tonight's fight between Rocky Hanlon and Louie the Looper.
Louie the Looper was still in training late last night.
Evidently, he ran out of sparring partners.
Midnight found him completely exhausted.
Perhaps this accounts for the wise money being switched over in favor of Hanlon late this afternoon.
Both men lack defense, but are strong on offense.
Therefore, I predict this will be the most offensive fight of the year.
Tommy? Oh, Tommy?
Tommy?
Relax. He said he'd be here.
So, he'll be here.
Yeah?
Tommy?
Tommy, Tommy.
A black cat.
Smoke.
Give me that.
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
Remember? Helen said you could see him in smoke or fog?
I know, but smoking will make you sick, then you won't be able to fight.
- I won't be able to fight?
- No.
Give me that cigar.
Tommy. Tommy.
Compliments of a friend.
Well, do tell.
"You can smell them or wear them.
"The fifth round will tell."
And you lay down in the fifth round.
If Tommy don't get here,
I'm gonna lay down right now.
Hey.
- Hey, hey.
- Hey, money.
Real money.
Here's $1,000 for you,
$1,000 for me, and one, two, three,
$4,000 for him.
$1,000 for you,
$1,000 for me, and one, two, three,
$4,000 for him.
Wait a minute.
Who's getting a bigger share than we are?
- Him.
- Who's him?
- The income tax man.
- The...
Tommy, Tommy.
Tommy.
You're on next.
All set?
All set.
What's the odds?
Five to two that Rocky smears him.
Oh!
- Where you going?
- To get a cop.
- Why?
- Somebody's gonna get murdered.
Ah! Come here, stupid.
People work a lifetime and never get $15,000.
- You're getting it for just lying down!
- Yeah.
Lying down?
That's what's got me worried.
The big question is, will I be able to get up?
Look, buddy, don't let me go in that ring without Tommy.
Look, Lou, if Tommy goes in the ring with you he'll knock out Rocky and Morgan will bump you off.
No. You get bumped off.
I get the hot seat.
I mean, I get the hot seat and you get bumped off.
One way or the other,
I'm gonna get it in the end.
Now, look, Lou, here's what we've got to do.
Without Tommy, you go in the ring and lay down like Morgan wants.
Everybody will be happy and we'll be in the 15 grand.
- But we promised Tommy.
- Sure, sure, sure.
He promised to be here.
Did he show up?
Yeah.
That's what I'm trying to tell you, but you won't listen.
I heard you telling him.
I'm sorry, Tommy.
I thought you ran out on us.
Doc had me tied in his lab.
I finally broke the straps.
Now, are you guys gonna play on my side or does Louie the Looper want to fight Rocky by himself?
I'm on your side, Tommy.
My heart's in the right place and I want to keep it there.
Don't worry.
When we get in the ring, I'll do the pitching.
As long as I don't do any catching.
Semi-final's over.
Let's go.
Come on, champ.
Follow me.
Chest out, stomach in.
I said, "Stomach in."
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the main attraction of the evening,
10 rounds of boxing.
Introducing, at 160 pounds, the leading contender for the middleweight crown,
Rocky Hanlon!
And in this corner, that new sensation,
Louie the Looper!
Morgan.
Hey. We still got a chance to change our minds.
I'd rather argue with Tommy than try and outrun Morgan's bullets.
I'm gonna go out there and lay down without even saying my prayers.
What are you guys whispering about?
We were...
"We were" what?
We were saved by the bell.
Your referee for tonight's main event,
Frankie Van.
Now, you boys know the rules,
I want a good, clean fight. Okay?
We ought to clean up on this.
Every dollar the syndicate has is riding on the Looper not going five rounds.
When I say,
"Break," I want you to break clean.
Now shake hands.
Go to your corners and come out fighting at the bell.
Just feint at his chin, Lou.
I'll do the rest. Sit down.
- Fight's on.
- No, no, no. Over there!
Oh-oh.
Believe me, folks.
There'll be an investigation on this one.
I'll swear there wasn't a blow struck.
He never even touched you.
What are you doing?
You told me to faint.
Get up, get up!
Eight, nine...
Wait a minute.
That's no fair hitting there.
If you're trying to throw this fight
I'll hold you up for 10 rounds and let him cut you to ribbons!
- Now get up.
- Five, six.
Now, do as I told you.
Okay, Tommy,
I'll be good.
Tommy?
Tommy he calls me.
Hearing the birdies already, pal?
I don't know.
Either these old eyes are failing or that boy hits like greased lightning.
Go to your corner.
One, two...
Go to your corner.
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
Left jab. Left jab.
Left jab. Left jab.
Right cross.
Go to your corner.
Did you deliver that money?
Sure, boss.
Three...
Tommy, let me finish him off, will you?
I can do it!
Six, seven... eight, nine.
Tommy. Tommy.
I didn't see what I was doing.
Go to your corner.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
Tommy, will you get up?
Open your eyes before he closes mine.
Here after, watch where you're punching.
Are you kidding?
Come on, Rocky, knock him out.
And so, the first round ends.
And I'm frank to say that I don't get it.
Get up there.
Do you realize that every punch
Rocky gets shortens my life?
What about my life?
Don't worry, let me handle this.
Sure. Sure.
Look at the condition of the guy in that other corner.
What's the matter, Rocky?
Rocky? Rocky, what's the matter?
There's something phony about this.
Get over to Rocky's corner.
He hits from nowhere and hard.
I can feel the guy's knuckles coming through the gloves.
It's like
I'm fighting two guys.
And I keep hearing voices, like someone's talking to him.
Hearing voices, eh?
That's bad.
I wonder what they're up to.
Yeah. So do I.
Rocky's been hit so hard, he's hearing voices.
I don't get this. Every one of the Looper's punches has been short.
I told you we couldn't trust those two guys.
Get me the torpedo.
Yes, boss.
Okay, Tommy, here's where we ring down the curtain.
- One, two, three.
- Tommy? Tommy?
Start punching.
Four, five.
- Tommy? Tommy?
- One, two, three...
- What are you doing?
- I'm smelling.
It's poor English, but you sure do!
- Seven, eight, nine.
- Tommy?
- Hey, Bud.
- What?
Throw in the towel, will you?
It's too dirty.
And besides, you're doing great.
He hasn't laid a glove on you.
Keep your eye on the referee.
Somebody in there's clouting me.
Six, seven, eight...
What's wrong, boss?
I'm not sure.
Tell Milt to get into a cop's uniform.
If those guys try to pull anything we'll give them the same treatment we gave O'Hara.
Louie the Looper has again been knocked for a loop.
Only this time the bell saved him.
He'll never come out for the next round.
Attaboy. You're doing great.
You're doing swell.
Stop stalling and give him the smelling salts.
Uh-oh. He blew his top.
Come on, Lou.
Snap out of it!
- Tommy, you're here.
- Yeah.
Good. You fight him for a while. I'm tired.
Get in and make it look good!
Folks, I've never seen anything like it.
Louie looks like he's out on his feet, but he's managing to avoid most of Rocky's punches.
Rocky's swinging wild.
One, two, three, four.
Right cross. Left cross.
Right cross.
Right to the stomach.
Upper cut.
- One, two, three...
- Get up, Rocky! Get up!
- Milt all set?
- Yes.
Let's go.
Stay where you are.
Seven, eight, nine, ten!
- I'll see you guys later.
- But, Tommy...
Never mind.
Let's get out of here.
No. The press boys, they're gonna shoot my picture.
And Morgan's boys want to shoot me.
Now, come on, let's get out of here.
Be sure nobody comes into that dressing room except Louie and his manager.
I know.
Same as last time, boss.
You sure look pretty in that cop's uniform.
I hope my mother don't see me.
Lou, Bud, where is he?
I don't know.
He said he'd see us later.
I'm sure I found the reagent.
We've got to get hold of him right away.
Doc, you better get him or you're gonna have two more patients on your hands.
Believe me.
If you don't mind,
Doctor, let's the three of us have a nice little fireside chat.
- Chat about what?
- I don't know, let's say arithmetic.
Every time I add up you two with those two guys the correct answer comes out Tommy Nelson.
- Really?
- Yeah, really.
Now, I don't know how it was done, but if you think that I think Louie the Looper knocked out Rocky Hanlon, you must think that I am a fool.
Again, you have the correct answer, lieutenant.
That's what I say.
Hey, wait a minute, Doc.
Wait a minute, please.
- Brother, are we glad you're here.
- Yeah?
Morgan is after us and Morgan is a crook and so is his whole gang.
Yes. But we're safe as long as you're here.
Don't you worry.
Morgan won't be going in your dressing room.
- Where are you going?
- The Looper's dressing room.
It's urgent, officer.
Sorry, folks, nobody's allowed inside but the Looper and his manager.
- Now, wait a minute.
- Now, you wait a minute.
Boy, I'm glad the cop was outside the door.
I'm not scared anymore.
Well, I am.
The cop outside the door didn't save O'Hara from getting the works or Tommy from going to jail.
Yeah.
But they can't give me the hot seat until you're dead.
Which won't be long now.
I've got one thing in my favor.
Morgan don't know that we know how he framed Tommy Nelson.
And he don't know that we're private detectives.
He does now.
Neither of you will get a chance to tell the cops anything.
Now, look, pal, let's talk this thing over.
There's no...
This is the payoff, Morgan.
- Who's talking?
- Tommy Nelson.
And I'm taking you to the cops to tell how you framed me.
Not as long as this gun is in my hand.
Get the gun, Lou.
Morgan, confess that you framed me or I'll break your arm!
Come on, Morgan, talk! Talk!
Why don't you play smart and confess?
Okay, Tommy,
I got him covered.
- Tommy? Huh?
- Let him have it.
- Let him have it.
- Okay.
Oh, no!
All right, Tommy Nelson, or whatever you are, the minute you touch me, he gets it.
Tommy!
Ha-ha! You missed!
Tommy, don't laugh.
If you get killed, it'll be through me!
- Tommy?
- Only two shots left, Morgan.
Try it again, Morgan!
Ah-ha!
Fellas, looks like
I'm in the clear.
We've cleaned up my case pretty well.
Tommy?
I think I can see you.
I can, too.
Tommy?
Hold onto that phony.
Tommy Nelson is innocent.
These are the men that killed O'Hara.
Lock them up, boys.
Get these mugs outta here.
Lou, where's Tommy?
Tommy?
We'll have to get him to the hospital.
Get who to the hospital?
Him.
Him?
Yeah, him.
This transfusion should give him strength enough to stand the reagent.
Anyway, we'll soon find out.
The reagent, nurse.
It's lucky you had the same type blood as Tommy.
Why can't you be lucky sometime?
Helen.
Tommy.
Hey, this is impossible.
Lou, I can see Tommy.
- Quiet, Bud.
- Yeah.
You're in a hospital.
You shouldn't make any noise.
It's catching.
My hand is gone!
Doc, help! Doc!
Don't worry.
Some of Tommy's blood may have backed up during the transfusion.
I'm not worried, Doc.
I'm gonna like being invisible.
I'll be the greatest detective in the whole world.
I'll be able to find anybody.
But you can't even find yourself.
That's what you think.
Come on, Bud.
Doc, can't you do something for him?
I don't think his invisibility will last long.
He couldn't have gotten that much serum.
Come on, Bud!
Come on, Bud.
Get in!
All right!
All right!
It wasn't me.
Please!
Lou, wherever you are, come on, let's go.
Wait a minute.
I got some unfinished business.
Oh, no!
Doc? Doc!
My feet are on wrong.
That's just like you.
You get everything backwards. Come on.
I will talk to you of art, for there is nothing else to talk about, for there is nothing else.
Life is an obscure hobo, bumming a ride on the omnibus of art.
Burn gas buggies.
And whip your sour cream of circumstance and hope, and go ahead and sleep your bloody heads off.
Creation is.
All else is not.
What is not creation is graham crackers.
Let it all crumble to feed the creator.
The artist is.
All others are not.
A canvas is a canvas or a painting.
A rock is a rock or a statue.
A sound is a sound.
Or is music.
A creature is a creature or an artist.
Where are John, Joe, Jake, Jim, Jerk?
Dead.
Dead.
Dead.
They were not born.
Before they were born, they were not born.
Where are Leonardo, Rembrandt, Ludwig?
Alive.
Alive.
Alive.
They were born.
Bring on the multitude with a multitude of fishes.
Feed them to the fishes for liver oil.
To nourish the artist.
Stretch their skins upon an easel.
To give him canvas.
Crush their bones into a paste.
That he might mold them.
Let them die.
And by their miserable deaths become the clay within his hands that he might form an ashtray or an ark.
For all that is comes through the eye of the artist.
The rest are blind fish swimming in the cave of aloneness.
Swim on, you maudlin, muddling, maddened fools.
And dream that one bright and sunny night, some artist will bait a hook and let you bite upon it.
Bite hard and die.
In his stomach, you are very close to immortality.
Walter?
Walter, what are you doing here?
I was looking at Carla's picture.
Do I pay you to look at pictures?
Now get to work.
I was just lookin'.
There are empty cups all over the place.
Clear them out.
You shouldn't be so rough on him, Leonard.
What do you say, Walter?
Hi.
I think I'll cut.
There's the man.
How you makin' it?
- Fine, man, how about you?
- Good enough.
- Valdez Vice.
- Yeah, Lacroix checkin' in.
Lou took over a couple of minutes ago.
Anything new at the door?
Nothing you can pound nails in.
A couple of hustlers.
One of them is short, fat, brunette.
Name's Skinny.
The other one was short also.
She was bleached and skinny.
- Name of fat.
- Probably.
I didn't get it.
They didn't give any pitches, though.
Guess you can keep an eye on 'em.
Okay, any heads?
Well, Jerry Sachs looked like he was straight.
I'm sure he's on it, anyway.
I didn't see any pushers around the place.
Lou said he'd check out
Jerry and sound him out later if he gets any higher.
I guess that's about it.
Okay, Art.
Go on home and get a good night's sleep, you fink.
Okay.
So long, Paul.
Everyone listened to my new poem, but do you think they really heard it?
- I heard it, Mr. Brock.
- Thank you, Walter.
I'm sure you did.
"Bring on the multitude with a multitude of fishes.
"Feed them to the fishes for liver oil
"to nourish the artist."
That was word for word.
Is it?
I'd forgotten.
You don't remember your own poem?
I refuse to say anything twice.
Repetition is death.
I don't get it.
When you repeat something, you are reliving a moment, wasting it, severing it from the other end of your life.
I believe only in new impressions, new stimuli, new life.
I thought you believed that life is an obscure hobo, bumming a ride on the...
I do believe that, Walter, but I also believe creative living.
To be uncreative, you might as well be in your grave, or in the army.
They tried to draft me once.
I couldn't pass the test.
Walter, Leonard's looking at you.
He's just about gone.
Walter has a clear mind.
One day, something will enter it, feel lonely, and leave again.
Too much.
Yes, Cats, yes.
If you want to know how beatniks live,
William and me will show you.
We'll introduce you to some wild ones.
You may even discover an artist of your own.
And how much is that going to cost us?
What cost?
A couple of bucks.
You wanna meet some beatniks, don't you?
Oh, no, it's the artists.
I'm just crazy about artists.
All that is comes through the eye of the artist.
The rest are just blind fish swimming in the cave of aloneness.
Oh, you must be an artist.
And working as a busboy too.
Feed him that, he will be satisfied.
The artist is.
All others are not.
That's most intriguing.
Are you a painter?
Well, no.
I'm working on something.
It's not ready yet.
What is it, man?
Finger painting?
Draw me a picture of a house, Walter.
Make some smoke coming out of the chimney.
I am working on something.
I'll show you soon.
Walter.
Is he, uh...
Did you get a good look, kid?
Go on home.
Hello, Mrs. Swickard.
Oh, Walter.
You look awful pale.
What did you have to eat tonight?
I had a salami sandwich, Mrs. Swickard.
If you were my son.
Why don't you let me fix you a nice bowl of soup.
Won't take but a minute.
It's okay.
I can fix myself something.
Besides, I got something important to do.
Oh, say, Walter.
Did you see anything of Frankie tonight when you went out?
I didn't see him at all.
If you do, tell him I've got a nice, fresh piece of halibut for him.
Tell him that?
I mean, do you think he'll understand?
He's only a cat.
Good night, Walter.
Frankie?
A canvas is a canvas or a painting.
A rock is a rock or a statue.
A sound is a sound, or it's music.
Come on.
Be a nose.
Be a nose.
Frankie, shut up!
Oh, what's the matter, Frankie?
How'd you get yourself stuck in a wall?
Wait a minute, I'll get you out.
Frankie?
Frankie?
You all right, Frankie?
Oh, Frankie.
Oh, Frankie.
Oh, Frankie.
I'm sorry.
Poor Mrs. Swickard.
She had a nice fresh piece of halibut for you.
I'll give you to her in the morning.
Repetition is death, Frankie.
Let them die.
And by their miserable deaths become the clay within his hands that he might form an ashtray or an ark.
Pray that you might be his diadem, gold, glory, paint, clay, that he might take you in his magic hands and wring from your marrow wonders.
Where are John, Joe, Jim, Jerk?
Dead.
Dead.
Dead.
Hi, Carla.
Well, Walter, what are you doing here so early?
I've brought something.
I think you'll like it.
Take that stuff to the laundromat, Walter.
- Huh?
- Don't mind him.
What have you got?
It's a thing I made.
Walter.
- You like it?
- What's he got?
Come look at this, Leonard.
Where'd you get that, an auction?
I made it.
You made that?
I said I did, didn't I?
Walter, it's very good.
- Honest?
- Honest.
What's it called?
Dead Cat.
Dead Cat?
That's its name?
Sure.
Well, it sure looks dead enough.
You wanna buy it?
Buy it?
That thing?
It'd scare people out of the place.
Don't be silly.
It's tremendous.
Look at the detail.
The anatomy's perfect.
Look at the expression on its face.
How come you put a knife into it?
I didn't mean to.
Just got carried away, huh?
Well, all right.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll put it in the corner of the alcove.
If it sells, we'll split 50-50, okay?
Sure.
Does this mean I'm an artist?
Maybe so, if you can do other things as well.
All that is comes through the eye of the artist.
Yeah, you're a real artist now.
Now go in back and scrub down those garbage cans.
March now.
You really like it?
We like it.
Now go on.
Did you see my cat?
What's the matter, you lose him?
How do you like my cat?
You made this thing, man?
Uh-huh.
It's crazy.
Crazy.
You wanna buy it?
Who me, man?
I'm tapped.
He likes my cat.
Get to work.
Hey, hey, Walter.
Come here a minute.
Hey, congratulations, man.
Walter, you're famous.
I saw your cat.
Did you like it, Mr. Brock?
You may call me Maxwell.
How'd you do it, Walter?
Oh, I just took some clay and fixed it up.
Attention.
Attention, everyone.
As you passed through these yellow portals,
I'm sure you noticed on your right a small clay figure and assumed this transfixed effigy to be the work of a master sculptor.
And indeed, so it is.
That master sculptor is in our midst.
He is none other than Walter Paisley, our very own busboy whose hands of genius have been carrying away the empty cups of your frustrations.
Mark well this lad.
His is the silent voice of creation.
Within the dark, rich soil of humility, he blossoms as the hope of our nearly sterile century.
Beautiful, Maxwell.
Bring me an espresso, Walter.
Maxwell, really beautiful.
Thank you.
Man, you are in.
Oh, Walter, you're wonderful.
Wonderful!
Listen, man, you got a pen?
Hey, Pops, what's happenin'?
Makin' a big scene for Walter.
Who'd he shoot?
He made a cat.
Out of clay.
- See you around.
- Yeah, later.
Will somebody clear this table, please?
Will somebody clear this table?
Did you hear them, Mr. De Santis?
They all like my cat.
Yeah, very good.
Now, look, Walter.
You must be tired.
Why don't you take the rest of the night off?
- I don't want to.
- No, no.
You got it coming.
Besides, you're creating an incident.
When people are applauding, they don't order coffee.
So, go on home and work on something.
Make another cat.
Well, I haven't got another cat.
Look, just go to the movies.
Please, Walter.
Go.
All right, Mr. De Santis.
Good night.
Good night, Walter.
Walter.
Walter, wait a minute.
Oh, hello, Naolia.
Walter, I dug it.
My cat?
It was the most wonderful, wildest, like, wiggiest thing I've ever seen.
Walter, you've done something to me.
Something deep down inside of my prana.
I have?
Oh, Walter, I wanna be with you.
You're creative.
You've got a hot light bulb glowing inside of you, and I wanna be warmed by it.
Gee, that's nice of you, Naolia.
Walter, take me away from here.
Take me away to some cool blue place and gas me.
I can't.
I gotta go home.
Oh, then I'll go home with you.
Oh, no.
Mrs. Swickard wouldn't like that.
She's my landlady.
Isn't there anything I can do for you?
I don't think so, Naolia.
Oh, Walter.
I can't let you just split like this.
I've gotta do something.
I've gotta contribute.
You don't have to do anything.
Wait.
Wait, there is one thing I can do.
One little thing.
Don't leave, Walter.
I wanna give you something.
Something that will make you remember me.
Put it in your pocket.
Now go, Walter.
Don't look back.
Just go!
Can I have your autograph, Mr. Paisley?
Why, certainly, my good woman.
Everybody likes my cat.
You wanna buy my statue, mister?
Okay.
Gee, I'll be famous.
And then I can ask Carla, and she'll say yes.
I know she will.
Hello, Walter.
Oh, hi.
You're Lou, ain't you?
I seen you at the Yellow Door plenty.
Come on in.
I was just making some pancakes.
You can have some if you like.
Did you see my cat?
Yeah, I saw your cat.
I also saw that chick lay these on you.
Oh, that was Naolia.
She's a nice girl.
She's kind of strange, though.
I guess she figures I get headaches or something.
Okay, Walter, who's your connection?
Connection?
Yeah, connection.
Who do you score from?
Where do you buy your horse?
Horse?
Horse.
Junk.
White stuff.
Heroin.
Is that what that is?
I never seen any of that before.
I always thought that was expensive.
Yeah, Walter, that can be real expensive.
Gee, wasn't that nice of Naolia to give me that expensive horse?
- Walter.
- Huh?
Police officer.
Oh, you're like an undercover man.
You're under arrest, Walter.
Under arrest for what?
Possession of narcotics.
Who, me?
What are you talking about?
Walter, I got you cold.
Now you just come along quietly.
I didn't do nothin'.
Naolia gimme those.
I didn't ask her for it.
I didn't even know...
Alright.
You can tell them that downtown.
Now let's go.
I ain't goin' no place with you.
Walter, do I have to point this at you?
You're gonna shoot me!
No, don't shoot me!
Walter, just relax.
No, you're gonna shoot me.
- Now just relax.
- Don't shoot me!
- Just shut up, would you?
- No, you're gonna shoot me!
Don't shoot!
Walter?
Walter!
Walter!
Are you all right?
I thought I heard you shouting a minute ago.
Walter!
What's all the noise in here?
Noise, Mrs. Swickard?
What noise?
Don't tell me I didn't hear a racket.
Are you sure you're all alone?
I'm always alone, Mrs. Swickard.
Walter, have you been talkin' to yourself again?
Well, I guess maybe
I have, Mrs. Swickard.
Somebody's got to.
Walter, you know, what you need is a girl.
She doesn't have to be pretty, just so long as she takes good care of you.
I can take real good care of myself, Mrs. Swickard.
Yeah, I can see that.
Look at this pad.
It's terrible.
Why don't you ever clean it up?
And when did you change these sheets last?
They look like they're alive.
Mrs. Swickard, I gotta meet some friends in a little while, and I gotta take a shower.
- Why don't you clean up this dump
- If you don't mind.
Well, what's the matter with you?
I didn't mean to hurt you, Lou.
But if you'd have shot me, you'd be moppin' up my blood now.
I can't help it if I got scared and hit you.
I didn't mean it.
It's crazy.
It's crazy.
I didn't know you had it in you, Walter.
How'd you do it?
Well, I just took some clay and fixed it up.
Go home and make something, Walter.
Make another cat.
But I haven't got another cat.
Well, I reported in here around midnight.
Lou had already been gone over an hour.
No.
Nobody seems to know where he went.
Why don't you put an alert out on him, and I'll check on him from here?
Okay, right.
The little fraud.
Louis Raby.
Age 29.
5'11" tall.
Dark complexion.
Hair, black and curly.
Last seen wearing blue jeans and gray sweater.

What do you suppose they want here?
You, man, you.
Hey, maybe they're looking for old Walter.
He's the criminal type.
Ain't you, Walter?
Sorry, Mr. De Santis.
That's all right, Walter.
Sit down.
- Who me?
- Sit down.
Greetings, man.
I'm not supposed to sit with the customers.
Swing!
Why shouldn't you sit at the table, Walter?
After all, you're a big artist now.
A true creator above mere mortals.
What's the big idea?
Idea?
I was just telling Walter the truth.
A man wanted to pay me $100 for the cat.
In fact, he's taking it home to show to his wife.
Proves that I underestimated
Walter's ability.
His work has enormous realism.
You can hardly tell it from the real thing.
Boy, that sounds like a real put-down.
Get off Walter's back, Leonard.
Am I on his back?
You're not very funny.
I'm not trying to be.
Walter, what are you gonna make next?
A dog, maybe.
Or a bird?
How about a few dozen cockroaches from your room?
Hey, man.
Why don't you make an elephant?
I got a new one.
Great.
What is it?
It's a full-length, life-size figure.
Crazy.
What is it called?
Murdered Man.
- When do we get to see it?
- Anytime.
Hey, that's a pretty far-out name for a statue.
I saw a statue once.
It was called, The Third Time
Phyllis Saw Me, She Exploded.
Man, what kind of a statue was that?
I don't know.
It was made out of driftwood and dipped in fluoric acid.
It was very wild.
What's wrong, Leonard?
Nothing.
It's the food in this dump.
Oh, man.
You should try the Sorrel Sewer.
They got wheat germ bagels.
Too much.
Excuse me, please.
I think he really is sick.
So who isn't?
De Santis.
I've been trying to get you all evening.
Gotta make a call.
Gotta call Lieutenant Valdez.
Listen, I was wrong about my wife.
She wants that cat after all.
Do you hear me?
I'll give you that $100 for the cat.
I can't talk to you just now.
All right, then, 200.
No!
No!
$300, and that's tops.
$300 for the cat?
I know I'm going out of my mind, but I've been collecting art pieces all over Europe for years, and this boy,
Walter Paisley, has got it.
I want to buy his first work.
And to make very sure that I get it,
I'll pay you $500.
$500 for the cat.
And the first look at his next stuff.
Someone has the cat just now, but I'll have him back in a few days.
Then you can have it for the $500.
Oh, thank you, sir.
I think I've made a bargain.
Call me when you're ready.
Good night.
Leonard.
Feel better?
Listen.
I'm going over to Walter's later, after the place closes to see Murdered Man.
You feel up to coming along?
♪ And a washer behind his ear ♪
♪ And the prison bell was tolling ♪
♪ But Tim Evans didn't hear ♪
♪ Saying, go down ♪
♪ You murderer, go down ♪
Look at the size of it.
Well, it's not really that big.
I got it on kind of a stand.
Let's see it.
I'm a little nervous.
I ain't never did a person before.
You can do anything if you set your mind to it.
It's hot in here.
You want me to open a window?
Come on, Walter.
Take off the sheet.
Don't you like it?
Walter, it's a masterpiece.
I've never seen anything like it before.
And I hope I never see anything like it again.
Neither do I.
It's hideous, and it's eloquent.
It expresses modern man in all his self-pity.
How did you ever find that in yourself, Walter?
Well, it wasn't easy.
What's the matter with you?
Nothing.
Nothing at all.
I've never seen anyone so squeamish.
What's your opinion, Leonard?
Don't ask me.
Oh, come on.
Even you must see its value.
Do you think that you or I could have conceived of such a thing, much less executed it?
Well, then admit it.
It's a work of genius.
I admit it.
Then let's take it down to the Yellow Door.
- No.
- Why not?
I'll tell you, but you cover it up again.
Please, huh?
Please!
Thank you.
What is all this nonsense?
Why do you want to hide it?
Well, I've been thinking.
I didn't realize how much talent Walter actually had.
It would be wrong to show his pieces one at a time.
Dead wrong.
You're right.
He should build a collection first.
Yes.
That's the idea.
Maybe when it's big enough, we can have a show.
A show?
- Just for me?
- No!
Not exactly.
I mean, it would take years and years.
It's getting hot again.
It would take you years to make that many statues, but your work would be featured.
It's a wonderful idea, Walter.
It's the only way to gain recognition.
The big art critics and art dealers will be there.
It'll be an event.
Yes, then we could unload and sell this stuff for a lot more.
But the show, how soon could we go?
Don't rush things.
It takes time.
But first of all, you've got to stop making these horrible statues.
Carla and I will guide you.
Maybe you can turn to free-form.
Free-form?
That's the movement today.
With his talent for realism?
You can see the direction his realism takes.
It's unhealthy.
But you said I was a genius.
I don't wanna be a busboy anymore.
Maybe you got a point there.
You shouldn't keep working at the Yellow Door.
Look.
I'm sure that man is gonna buy your dead cat, so here.
Here's your fee in advance, $50.
And if you need more, I've got it, so don't worry.
I've got great faith in you, Walter.
Gee, $50 for something I made.
Now you're a professional.
Let's go.
Okay.
Good night, Walter.
Keep up the good work.
Yeah, but don't rush things.
You got all the time in the world.
Come on, Carla!
Good night, Walter.
Good night.
Yippee!
Did you holler, Walter?
I'm an artist, Mrs. Swickard.
Yeah?
Oh, sure you are, Walter.
I am.
Look!
Good heavens!
One of the greatest advances in modern poetry is the elimination of clarity.
I'm proud to say my poetry is only understood by that minority which is aware.
Aware of what?
Not of anything, stupid.
Just aware.
Man, this place is beginning to feel like a lineup.
Yeah, baby.
If it don't cool off pretty soon,
I'm gonna haunt somebody else's joint.
We may have to start drinking.
Yes, man, yes.
Yes, that's my man.
Yes.
Yes, man, yes.
Good evening, Walter.
Good evening, Carla.
Sylvia, didn't you see me wave my zen stick?
Why, it's Walter Paisley.
Bring me a cappuccino and a piece of papaya cheesecake and a bottle of Yugoslavian white wine.
Yes, sir, Mr. Paisley.
Good evening, Walter.
Maxwell, how have you been?
I see the rewards of achievement have come your way.
Well, after all, I'm a successful sculptor now.
Indeed.
Hey, man, dig Walter the wigger.
He's comin' out like he just cured cancer.
Let us make the scene.
Crazy.
I was just suggesting to Walter that he try his hand at free-form.
Why do you suggest anything to Walter?
Are you the spokesman for society, come to put your stifling finger in his eye?
Good evening, gentlemen.
Who invited these two down from the clouds?
Maxwell.
Yoo-hoo!
Clear the table.
Bring a bowl.
I may be sick.
It's Alice the awful, come to spread cheer and cholera.
Look at my suntan, everybody?
Do we have to?
Where have you been, Alice?
I went to Big Bur and looked for Henry Miller.
You didn't find him, I hope.
- No, he's in Europe.
- Good.
Why is the busboy sitting here?
I'm not the busboy anymore.
That's right.
Walter has become a sculptor.
Oh, really?
I'm a model, you know.
I only charge $25 an hour.
Would you like to do me?
I just might.
Never mind that.
Walter's gonna try free-form.
There you go again.
I may take my business to the Sorrel Sewer.
As a matter of fact, I was going to suggest to Walter that he try a female figure as a change from the violent death theme.
You really should, Walter.
You know what?
If you like, I'll be your model for free.
I couldn't.
Not you.
Man, if you're gonna be an artist, you've gotta do nudes.
Nudes.
Right.
Right.
Right.
Ain't nobody an artist unless he does nudes.
Will you get them out of here before we wind up in night court?
Let's change the subject.
I'm sick of hearing about sculpture.
Nobody knows how to do that anymore, much less the busboy from the Yellow Door.
Who do you think you're talkin' about?
Don't shout at me!
I don't like you.
Nobody asked for your opinion, Walter.
You're just a simple little farmboy, and the rest of us are all sophisticated beatniks.
That's all, man.
Let's split.
Yeah, man.
I gotta make me some air.
See?
You made them leave.
What did I do?
The first beneficial service of your benighted life.
It proves we're all good for something.
Are you saying that this busboy is better than I?
Yes.
I think this whole bit about him being a sculptor is just a big put-on for my benefit.
That's not true.
I am a sculptor.
Oh, yeah?
Prove it.
Make something out of this.
There.
Hand.
That isn't a real hand.
If you were a sculptor, you'd create something for me.
A harpoon would be very nice.
I'm goin' home.
Alice, you're obnoxious.
But he's such an idiot.
Yes?
What are you doing here?
I wanted to apologize for being nasty to you this evening.
So you apologized.
Good night.
Listen, twerp.
Why don't you get out of here and let me go to bed?
I didn't finish talkin' to ya.
I decided to make that female figure after all.
Oh?
I'd like you to pose for it.
Remember what I said about my price?
$25 an hour.
If you wanna pay it,
I don't mind posing.
When do you wanna start work?
Tonight?
You mean right now?
Uh-huh.
Wait till I get my sweater.
You could use a little more heat around this place.
It's bad for the clay.
You'll get used to it.
Well, I'm almost ready.
Here.
Sit in this chair, and I'll pose you.
Kind of rickety.
How's this pose?
Oh, that's fine.
It's very good.
Just stay like that.
It doesn't look like very much clay.
Oh, it's enough.
Put this around your neck.
Ah, breakfast.
Watch it.
The plate's hot.
Are these fertile eggs?
Are these eggs fertile?
Naturally.
What did you fry them in?
We ran out of the safflower seed oil, but I found a bottle of peanut oil on the shelf.
Don't worry.
It's not hydrogenated.
Is that the cold-pressed stuff, or the junk Hilda bought by mistake?
Yes, man, yes.
Hi.
- Good morning, Walter.
- Hi, Walter.
What brings you here?
- Have some breakfast.
- What are you having?
Soy and wheat germ pancakes, organic guava nectar, calcium lactate, and tomato juice, and garbanzo omelets, sprinkled with smoked yeast.
- Join us?
- No, thanks.
Sounds great, though.
I brought something to show you.
Could I have some of the guys help me?
- Is it Murdered Man?
- It's better.
Come on.
Porters.
Put it in the middle of the room.
When did you do this, Walter?
Last night.
It doesn't take me very long.
I should say not.
Well, let's see it, man.
Walter, I can't believe it.
I'm honored to know this man.
- Do you think it's nice?
- Yeah, she's beautiful.
Do you think it's nicer than Murdered Man?
I don't know, Walter.
It's impossible to choose.
They're both great.
Walter, I am deeply moved.
To show my appreciation,
I'm going to give a party tonight at the Yellow Door, in your honor.
And I shall compose a poem.
Some more champagne, your majesty?
Hear, hear.
- Where, where?
- There, there.
That's fine.
Can I just have another little kiss?
Walter, you're a letch.
I am?
Here we go!
Here we go!
All right.
All right.
Walter, the bird that flies now, pays later through the nose of ambidextrous apathy.
Necrophiles may dance upon the place mats in an orgy of togetherness.
The highway of life cuts sharply through the shady ghettos and the ivy-covered tombs.
And laughter rings from every time capsule in the star-spangled firmament.
And in the deep freeze, it is the children's hour.
And no one knows that Duncan is murdered.
And no one knows that
Walter Paisley is born.
Duncan knows.
Tuesday's sunrise knows.
Alley cats and garbage cans and steaming pavements.
And you and I and the nude descending the staircase and all such things with souls, we know that Walter paisley is born.
Ring rubber bells.
Beat cotton gongs.
Strike silken cymbals.
Play leathern flutes.
The cats and cans and you and I, and all such things with souls, we shall hear Walter Paisley is born.
And the souls become flesh.
Walter Paisley is born!
Marvelous, darling.
Marvelous.
Man, like, that was the greatest gas I ever heard.
Crazy, what did he say?
Didn't you hear him?
No, man, I'm too far out.
Maxwell, that was magnificent.
I feel so elegant.
Walter deserved every word of it.
It makes me so glad I'm aware.
Did you hear what he said?
Yes, Walter.
All about me.
It's true, isn't it?
Every word.
You better hold off on the bubbly, artist.
Yeah, why?
You might talk too much.
What would I say?
Most anything, I expect.
Are you two trying to ignore the rest of us?
Oh, not me, Maxwell.
I wouldn't ignore you.
I know what it is to be ignored.
Tell us what you're going to do next, Walter.
I'm gonna make the most wonderful, wildest, wiggiest things you've ever seen.
I'm gonna make big statues and little statues, tall statues and short statues.
I'm gonna make statues of nobodies and statues of famous people.
Statues of actors and poets.
And people who sell things on television.
And a statue of the mayor.
And some opera singers and their intimate friends.
And everybody will say,
"Walter, let me shake your hand.
"It's been a real pleasure to have known you."
Hear, hear.
Alley cats and garbage cans, they know that Walter Paisley is born.
Ring rubber bells.
Beat cotton gongs.
Strike silken cymbals.
Play leathern flutes.
Tell us what you're donna do next, Walter.
I'm gonna make big statues, little statues.
Movie stars and poets and guys who sell things on television.
And the mayor and some opera singers.
What you gonna do next, Walter?
What am I gonna do next?
What am I gonna do next?
I gotta do something before they forget.
I know what it's like to be ignored.
Who are you?
What do you want?
Life is an obscure hobo, bumming a ride on the omnibus of art.
Huh?
What did you say?
What is not creation is graham crackers.
Let them all crumble to feed the creator.
Oh, beat it.
You must be nuts.
No!
No!
No!
No, no!
No!
Hello, Leonard.
Beautiful morning, isn't it?
Was.
What's that you got in the box?
Just wait till you see this.
Extra!
Extra!
Horrible murder in furniture factory.
Read about the man who got cut in half.
Extra!
Extra!
Police can only find part of him.
Leonard.
What's the matter, Leonard?
You made a bust.
Yeah.
Isn't it wonderful?
What's the matter, Leonard?
Put it down, Walter.
Please.
Walter.
Walter, listen to me carefully.
I don't want you to make any more statues.
Do you understand?
No more statues.
Well, why not?
I gotta make statues, Leonard.
You heard Brock.
They want me to make them.
If I stop makin' them, I'll just be a busboy again.
Brock.
He's behind all of this with his stupid, bitter poetry.
Listen.
You've got to stop and right away.
I'm beginning to feel responsible.
Why?
What did you do?
Never mind.
Walter, I've decided to have that show for you right away.
Yes.
When Carla comes, we'll have her work up some nice invitations.
We'll have them printed up.
We'll invite the critics and the art collectors.
We'll tell them.
Well, I don't see why we can't go.
Mr. Leonard de Santis is afraid to have you come.
You, who buy his coffee and lure his tourists.
You, who are the heart and soul and meat of the Yellow Door.
He's slighted you.
Did you get an invitation?
I did not.
But I'm going anyway.
Not to drink his champagne, but to see Walter's triumph.
After that, we go no more.
Hi, Maxwell.
I won't say, good luck, Walter.
Why not?
It would imply that you could not succeed on your ability alone.
You look so handsome.
I do?
So do you.
I mean, you look so pretty.
Thank you.
Are you ready?
We've got plenty of time.
I know, but I wanted to talk to you.
Okay.
We can go now if you like.
Bye.
Later, man, later.
Swing.
Man, why do you suppose
Walter wants to get her alone?
Do you suppose he could be physically attracted to her?
No, man.
He ain't the type.
He don't get enough Vitamin E.
Maxwell gave him a bottle of wheat germ oil once.
Maybe he just started taking it.
What did you want to talk to me about, Walter?
Well, what kind of people do you like, Carla?
Oh, thinking people, artistic people, I guess.
You think I'm artistic?
Of course I do.
That means you like me.
I like you very much, Walter.
I thought you did, on account how you kissed me the other night.
Oh, that was for your sculpture of the girl.
Your Nude in the Chair.
Carla, I've been alone for a long time, and I know you been alone
'cause you never seem to go out with anybody, even though Leonard's always asking you to go out with him.
And I just...
What are you trying to say?
Carla, I don't want to make statues anymore.
I wanna get married to you.
How long have you been thinking about this, Walter?
Oh, for a long time.
Ever since you first came to work at the club.
You were the only one who was ever nice to me.
I didn't know you loved me until you kissed me.
Walter, I do like you and I did kiss you, but that was because of your work.
There's more to being in love with someone than just that.
You mean you don't love me?
I'm afraid that's what I mean.
But you gotta love me.
Why do you think I made that statue of Alice?
Walter, I'm sorry, but...
You just can't be sorry.
I wanna marry you.
Now, calm down, Walter, and let's go in there and then maybe when the show's over, we can talk about it some more.
Well, I don't wanna talk about it.
I get it.
I see the whole thing now.
Nobody knows that Walter Paisley is born.
Carla, will you do one favor for me?
Just about anything, Walter.
Would you let me make a statue of you?
Would you really like to?
That would make me very happy.
Okay.
Tonight.
I'll make a statue of you tonight, okay?
Come on.
Walter?
No, thanks.
This could bring about a return to realism.
Yes, a one-man return.
We have many artists about but no craftsmen.
This man knows his anatomy.
I'd give 1,500 for this.
After you read my review, it'll probably cost you 5,000.
So, what's the trouble?
Why should you be so depressed?
Have you heard the things they're saying?
You can make 25,000 on these pieces alone.
I thought you put money down.
I do, but 25 thou?
Leave me alone.
Out!
Man, we have come to make the scene.
How about some cappuccino, man?
We got the bread.
We're not open for business.
This is an art exhibit.
No bums.
Get out!
- That art is a bum, man.
- Yeah, and he's sober.
That's his problem.
All right, man, alright.
We'll wait outside.
Yeah, you wait outside.
Where you goin', Carla?
What's the matter?
Walter, there's a body inside that statue.
Oh.
Oh, that's Alice.
It's all right, Carla.
Maxwell says it's all right.
"Let them become clay in his hands that he might mold them."
Walter, you stay away from me.
Don't you see, Carla?
I made them immortal.
Don't you see?
I can do the same for you.
Call Valdez.
Have him send me some cars.
I'm going after Paisley.
I'm going with you.
Hey, man, what is the score?
Walter Paisley's a murderer.
Man, I saw him chasing
Carla down the street.
Walter.
What was that?
Nobody knows I'm here.
Walter.
No.
He couldn't know.
They're dead.
- How could they know?
- Did you see him?
He's hiding around here someplace.
He can't hide just because we're in clay and he isn't.
Walter, go home.
He won't know where else to go.
Walter, go home.
Where is he?
What's the matter with you?
Walter.
Walter.
We'll find him.
We'll have him soon, Lou.
We'll teach him he can't murder us and get away with it, won't we?
Walter.
Walter.
What you gonna do now, Walter?
I'll hide where they'll never find me.
There's his room.
He's gone crazy.
Paisley!
Paisley, open up!
Paisley!
I suppose he would have called it Hanging Man.
His greatest work.

Okayama, Bizen
It's very cold.
Yes, I'm chilled to the bone.
It's past winter solstice.
I wonder how long this cold will go on...
A moment, please.
Iemon Tamiya again begs...
...the hand of your daughter Iwa in marriage.
You again?
I've told you: I will not give Iwa to a libertine like you.
What proof do you have that I'm a libertine?
That you would demand proof of such a thing is very amusing.
I guess that's how a man of no status would think.
But you don't deceive Samon so easily.
I may have no position, but I am a samurai!
You believe lies!
A samurai speaks but once:
...you will not have her!
You say that your disrepute is all due to lies, Tamiya...
...yet you lie in wait in a place like this...
...conduct unworthy of even the lowest samurai.
Samon, you dishonor yourself by even speaking with him.
Let's be on our way.
Hear me...
...I want no more of you haunting my grounds like some stray cat!
Wait!
Why do you go back on your promise...
...and treat me like some thief?
I've said no. There's no sense in you arguing.
Enough! It is you who makes no sense!
Who are you to silence me?
A man of no status does not silence an elder!
No man talks down to me!
Silence!
Hold your tongue!
I would never give my daughter to a prattling fool!
Do you call me a fool?!
Wait!
Well, chief...
...I'd say you're in trouble.
Bastard!
Hey! Take it easy!
I've got an idea.
Leave this to me.
I know exactly what to do.
Miss Iwa, Yomoshichi is here.
What a terrible thing to happen to your father!
It is a tragedy for you, as well.
Ozawa Usaburo has a slash right across his face.
It must have been him! He tried to rob your father once before.
I suppose he was angry because
Father filed a complaint.
Yomoshichi...
...may I ask that you delay...
...your marriage to my sister Sode...
...until we've taken vengeance?
The sooner I avenge this wrong, the better.
Iemon, would you be so kind as to accompany us...
...and render assistance?
Gladly.
For you, Miss Iwa, anything.
Well, well, well!
I wonder who's the lucky man...
What a pretty bride!
Yes.
Chief...
...when do we get rid of that guy?
It irritates me just seeing him walking with Sode.
Iwa, aren't you getting tired?
Yes, I am.
It's been six months since we left home.
You're not stringing me along, are you?
I'm the one being strung along, stuck with a man like you!
I'm a samurai!
If you won't help me...
...I'll just have to tell them what happened.
Watch your tongue, Naosuke!
So you will get rid of
Yomoshichi for me...
As soon as I have the chance.
Shiraito Falls/Soga Shrine;
1 Mile
I want to pray where the Soga brothers took revenge...
...in the old story.
But I feel so weak...
I'll pray to them for you,
Miss Iwa. You wait here.
Would you, please?
Yomoshichi...
...would you pray to them for me as well?
Of course.
Chief...now's our chance.
Don't waste it.
Try and push him over the cliff.
I'll stab him if you miss.
A magnificent sight!
Indeed.
It's amazing that when the Sogas planned their revenge...
...these falls fell silent to let them hear each other.
I wish the ladies could see it.
Yes.
Villain!
I guess this makes us both murderers.
Quiet!
Who's going to back up your story if you kill me?
Iwa! Just a little longer!
They'll be back any minute.
There's trouble!
Usaburo attacked us!
Yomoshichi fell over the falls!
Yomoshichi?!
They were too strong for us.
They're a bad bunch.
They almost got the chief, too, but he was too quick.
He got away.
I'm ashamed of myself!
Let's follow them!
But my sister...
But if we don't, who knows when we'll see them again?
Naosuke...
I'll take care of Iwa.
You and Sode follow them.
Right!
Come on, Sode. They won't get away from us!
Take care, Iwa.
Miss Iwa!
I'm sorry.
I'm nothing but trouble.
What are you talking about?
You're my wife!
A snake!
Don't kill it!
They're servants of the gods!
And I was born in their year!
Don't be stupid...damn this thing!
Edo
You must be tired.
Why not rest a while?
Last night I dreamed of my sister.
Father was taking us to a festival.
In Okayama, they'll be having the Hachiman Festival now.
I wonder what's happened to Sode...
Is she here in Edo...
...or did she and Naosuke go off somewhere?
It's not fair that we're so poor!
If there were any justice...
...you'd have a position...
Iwa!
Stop that!
I don't want to hear it.
When are you going to avenge my father?
I'll take revenge!
As soon as I get the chance!
We haven't found my sister...
...we have no idea of how we'll revenge ourselves...
...and you're reduced to doing piecework...
Enough!
So you want to leave and go back home?
And you're tired of living in poverty?
Maybe you're tired of me.
Do what you want, then. So will I!
I didn't mean that!
Iemon!
Iemon!
Elixir!
Five pennies!
The miracle potion!
Elixir!
Five pennies!
The miracle potion!
Back early again?
He's been telling me all about you, Missus.
How you two spend your afternoons...
'Elixir! Five pennies!
The miracle potion!
'Fits, convulsions, dizziness...
'Elixir of Holland! Good for what ails you! Five pennies a grain! '
You've been drinking again!
We got bored.
We stopped in at the tavern on the corner.
But all the time I was thinking of you here alone...
I'm so sick of shouting
'Elixir! Five pennies! '
Well, there's a reason why you're doing it.
We have to find my sister, and take revenge!
'Revenge'...let's not talk about that now.
Come on, Sode...
Let go!
I wasn't born to be the wife...
...of a man of low birth!
What do you mean, 'wife'?
We're just pretending we're married.
I can't wait much longer...
You promised you wouldn't touch me till we took revenge!
Oh, come on!
No! Let go of me!
Sode!
Sode!
The girl can come pour our drinks for us...
...or you don't get by us.
It was you who bumped me with your scabbard!
So you aren't going to give her to us?
We'll just have to take her.
Hey!
Who are you?!
Show your face!
Thank you. You got us out of a tight spot.
You're very good with a sword.
You're too kind.
I hope we will come to know you better.
If you'll permit me...
I can't accept that.
Take it as a token of my gratitude.
I may have no situation...
...but I am a samurai.
One rarely meets a gentleman these days.
Ume, you should thank him.
Yes.
I am most truly grateful.
It's so hot!
Welcome back!
It's the bosa!
Welcome!
Hot, ain't it. I wish it'd rain!
Hello!
It's hot!
Will I see you later?
Two dice, two dots! Evens!
How can you gamble in this heat?
Takuetsu...lend me some money.
Again?
You have a pretty wife waiting at home.
She'll be my collateral.
What?
Sure! For her I'll lend you as much as you like.
But I'll hold you to your word.
I don't care. I'll get it from Naosuke later.
Hey, chief...
Oh, it's you...
I don't have a tree that grows money, you know.
Oh, I forgot...
...I've got to go out to another customer.
We've been in Edo for two years now.
I'm getting tired of being broke all the time.
Even if we have to kill someone, let's do something big.
Just like that night in Okayama.
Naosuke!
Welcome home. Would you like to change your clothes...
...or will you eat first?
No.
It's so humid tonight...
Oh, yes...Takuetsu came to give me a massage.
He was talking about a Naosuke from Okayama...
Naosuke?
Have you seen him?
Of course not!
But Takuetsu said...
I haven't seen him, I said!
Takuetsu said you still owe him money...
Shut up!
All right! I'll pawn something.
What have we got?
Nothing.
Nothing, eh?
Wait!
Without that the mosquitoes will eat him alive!
This place is thick with them!
Then chase them away!
Let go!
A tortoise-shell comb!
I didn't think we had anything like this left.
This is worth money!
Lend me this.
Anything but that!
It was my mother's!
Please! Not that!
Let go!
I won't!
Give it back!
Instead...
...take this sash.
Have your damn comb, then!
Iemon!
You'd better pay me pretty well for this one, Ma.
It's been hard work prying lemon loose from Iwa.
I know that.
But it was your mother who opened this door, don't forget.
You're a tough old bird!
I have to be, with a no-good like you for a son!
It's not much, but it's yours.
Thank you very much!
Sir...
...I hope this will be the start of a long association.
Your daughter seems pleased.
If those two marry, you'll be the matchmaker.
You couldn't turn against my son then, sir!
You've gotten so thin lately...
Your husband makes you worry, I'll bet.
I heard something from someone...
...about your husband and
Old Man Ito's daughter, Ume.
Ume?!
I'd watch out if I were you.
Takuetsu...
...you aren't married, so you might not understand.
That doesn't happen once two people are married.
You may be right.
I just thought in this case
I should say something.
No.
My husband, at least, would never do such a thing!
Chief...
Oh, Naosuke...
Did you have fun?
How was the young lady?
Here's some pocket money.
Why don't we stop fooling around with all this small stuff...
...and make up our minds and do something?
Old Man Ito won't keep giving us money for nothing.
I know that.
Then you get my drift.
Why not make Ume the happiest woman in the world?
If it was only as easy as all that...
Chief! Don't tell me you're afraid of Iwa.
If that's the problem, just kill her.
What?!
You've done it before.
What's one more?
Be tough now, or you won't spend your old age in comfort.
How would you like a position in some lord's household?
Chief...wait!
What if Iwa was to find out the truth?
Then what, Chief?
Is this another one of your schemes?
I'm glad you asked.
Why not use Takuetsu?
Takuetsu?
He’s in love with Iwa.
We can set him up so people think he's her lover.
And there's nothing illegal in killing...
...a woman who's taken a lover behind her husband's back.
But I couldn't kill Iwa!
There you go again!
All right...I can get some foreign poison.
Poison?!
How are you feeling now?
I just get worse and worse.
I'm not afraid to get sick and die myself...
...but our poor child!
If I die...
If you die...
You wouldn't take a new wife right away, would you?
Sure I would.
Right away.
A nice, rich one.
What's wrong with that?
It happens all the time.
So it's true about you and
Old Man Ito’s daughter?
And what about taking revenge for my father?
'Revenge'...
I'm sick of hearing about it.
How can you say that?!
I'm fed up to the teeth with it!
What of it?
If you don't like it, leave!
Find another man to help you!
Are you going to leave me for her?
Shut up!
Stop crying. It was just a bad joke.
Forgive me.
You'll get sick.
I know...tomorrow I'll get you some medicine that works.
Chief, you're late!
I'll go on ahead.
We don't want to keep Ume waiting on her wedding day.
Wait!
What are we going to do about Iwa?
Not her again!
Here's the potion.
First her face will break out, and then she'll die.
Here you go.
Take it! Stop being so much damn trouble!
And this position you speak of is assured?
Come now! Don't be so formal!
Once the ceremony is over, you'll be one of the family.
You won't have to worry.
I'll take care of everything.
Won't I, Ume?
You and Naosuke have been a great help to me.
Me? Iwa's lover?
Don't make fun of me!
I'm serious.
Out!
This must be a joke.
You doubt the word of a samurai?
But Iwa's your wife!
And it's her husband who asks.
I understand!
So the story about you and the Ito girl is true...
You're slow.
So you'll do it? I'll give you whatever you want.
This is too good to be true!
This is so beautiful!
And you bought it for me!
I'm so happy!
What are you doing in there?
I bought some medicine for your circulation.
I'm boiling some up for you.
Thank you!
It's been so long since you were so nice to me.
I spoke to you so harshly last night...
I'm sorry.
And I always answer back...
I'm sorry, too.
Let's both forget what's in the past.
Yes.
There's fireworks at Ryogoku tonight.
Next year I'll take you to see them.
They say this medicine works wonders.
Here. Drink it, quickly.
You're so nice to me tonight...
I'm so happy...
...I'm crying!
Good evening.
Good evening!
Good evening.
Takuetsu...you've come at a perfect time.
You know what to do?
Come in.
Good evening. Your husband asked me to come.
Thank you.
Iemon...you've thought of everything...
It's nothing.
I'll go see about that position.
Why not go and see the fireworks as well?
Perhaps I will.
It's very humid tonight...
Usaburo! I've been waiting...
Naosuke!
Sode!
Take a good look!
That's Usaburo!
Vengeance!
I'm covered in sweat!
Thank you, Naosuke!
Don't thank me.
As of tonight, we're husband and wife!
I've got something else to do.
You go home...
...and get ready!
Right here...
The grief a husband brings cramps this muscle here.
The best way to uncramp this muscle is to cut the ties...
...that bind you to a husband like that.
Stop that!
He may have no position, but I am wife to a samurai!
Lay a hand on me again and I'll have your head!
Please! Spare me!
This wasn't my idea!
Your husband knows all about it.
He does?!
He knows everything.
Is this true?!
What's wrong?!
My face! My head hurts!
I can't breathe! I'm dizzy!
Get me some water!
Water...
More water!
Missus...here's your water.
Is something wrong?
No!
Is this...
...is this me?!
Takuetsu!
You did this!
No! It wasn't me!
Iemon planned all this so he could marry Ito’s daughter!
He said he'd reward me...
...if I seduced you!
Iemon?!
Takuetsu!
Missus, wait! I didn't do anything!
Missus!
Takuetsu!
My little boy!
Oh, hateful lemon!
How could you be so cruel...
...to one who never sinned against you!
You poor child! How could I leave you to a man like that?
Die with your mother!
I could never enter paradise if I left you behind.
Iemon, you heartless and cold-blooded brute...
...do you think I will leave you with this debt unpaid?!
Iemon!
Why are you rushing away?
Did you do it?
No!
I didn't do anything.
Don't hide it.
She's still a samurai wife.
For someone of your caste, the thrill of a lifetime.
A monster like that?
Takuetsu!
Did you stab her?
Of course not!
She did that with a razor!
Whatever.
But Takuetsu...
...you know what samurai do to adulterers, don't you?
Sir! I didn't do anything!
Naosuke!
You finally did it!
Naosuke...
...pull off one of the shutters.
We'll nail them onto it.
The law says I can lay them together and cut them in half.
No one will say anything.
We'd better hurry.
Tonight's your wedding.
All right, let's go!
Chief! What's wrong?
We're not poor any more.
Tonight's a great night!
There's nothing to worry about.
I wouldn't expect you to know how I feel.
'On Takasago Beach...
'...raise the sail...
'...of your ship...
'...and with the ebbing tide run with the moon...'
You must be tired.
Will you have some tea?
Thank you.
Come and change.
Iemon...
How could you give me...
...poison to drink?
I will visit my hatred on you.
Be sure of that.
What's wrong?
Why did you shout?
I'll sleep alone tonight.
What is it?
A snake!
There's nothing to be afraid of now, Ume.
Oh, lemon!
Ume, do you still have to act so shy with me?
Iemon...
...what did I ever do to wrong you?
You! You're dead!
Ume!
Ume!
Iemon? Sir?
Is anything wrong?
May I come in?
Iemon!
Damn you, Iwa!
Iemon?
Iemon?
Takuetsu!
Sir!
There's hair caught in this... that's disgusting!
A comb! This looks like tortoise-shell!
What's this around my feet?
Someone could still wear this...
Catching any eels, Naosuke?
Hello, Chief. Going fishing?
I need a change.
Do you think it's safe for you to leave the temple?
I feel like I'm suffocating in there.
Going already?
If I stir up the mud chasing eels
I'll scare off the other fish.
I thought I'd go home and have some fun with Sode.
If you'll excuse me...
Iwa! Do you haunt me still?!
Iemon...
...I will make an end to the blood...
...of the Tamiya name!
Go to hell!
Takuetsu!
Pay what you owe me.
Takuetsu! You, too?!
Do you never stop?!
That's awful!
You scared me! What's wrong?
Two corpses turned up in the river at Mannen Bridge!
Corpses?
A man and a woman.
They were nailed to a shutter.
What's wrong?!
The bucket's full of snakes!
There's no snakes here...
This comb...
Where did you get it?
At the Potter's Field in Kamimura. Why?
This is my sister's!
It was Mother’s...
Don't be stupid!
There's lots of combs like that.
No. This comb is my sister's.
And this kimono is hers, too.
I'm sure of it!
What if something's happened to her?
Iwa!
How did you find us so late, and in this back street?
Come in!
We were talking about you!
I'm so glad you're here!
And so relieved you're safe!
This is your comb, isn't it?
I knew it!
Forgive me!
Forgive me!
It was lemon Tamiya who killed your father...
...and Yomoshichi's!
He's at Zuishoji Temple at Snake Mountain!
Forgive me! Forgive me!
The Bizen Inn
Miss Iwa!
I was dreaming...
Or was I?
Miss Sode!
It's you!
It's me! Yomoshichi!
Yomoshichi!
You're alive!
A woodcutter pulled me out of the waterfall.
When my wounds healed
I came to Edo.
It's amazing you found me here.
Yes...
It's very strange...
My sister...
Miss Iwa?
Yes.
This is her comb.
It was a revelation!
Miss Sode...
...Miss Iwa came to me in a dream and told me...
...it was a lie that Ozawa Usaburo killed our fathers.
She said it was lemon Tamiya.
So it was him!
You knew that?
Yes.
When my sister appeared
Naosuke started raving...
...that lemon was our enemy.
That was all in my dream!
Iemon and Naosuke stabbed me and pushed me over the falls!
Could they have killed my sister?
They must have.
She told me where lemon was, and that I should avenge her.
Naosuke said so, too.
Iemon's at the Zuishoji Temple at Hebiyama, in Honjo.
Chief, how can I help if you won't say anything?
Open your mouth and talk to me!
Where did Old Man Ito keep his damn money?!
It's got to be either under the floorboards or in the ceiling.
Let's get the hell out of Edo...
...and start over somewhere brand new!
Hiding out in this snake-infested temple won't do us any good!
You poison your pretty wife, set a masseur up as her lover...
...kill him and dump them in a ditch at Potter's Field.
I'm impressed! The samurai is as much a villain as I am.
This is no time to go weepy and womanish!
We're both vermin out of the same hole. So where's the money?
Naosuke...
...I told you, I didn't take a penny out of that house.
Go away.
Leave me.
Go away, I tell you!
This is interesting... you're going to kill me?
Go on, then. Do it.
You don't know your place,
Naosuke.
All of this was your...
Stop this whining! Kill me if you're going to.
You can't, can you.
You haven't got the spine.
Cut me down!
Iemon!
Iemon!
Iemon!
Yomoshichi! You're alive!
Iemon Tamiya...
I avenge my father!
I avenge my father... and my sister!
Damn you!
Die!
Iwa...forgive me...
Iwa!
Forgive me!
Iwa!
I was wrong!
Forgive me!
The End
It is a known fact
that there existed in Central
Europe a Count Dracula.
Though human in appearance and cultured in manner,
he was, in truth, a thing undead.
A force of evil.
A vampire.
Feeding on the blood of innocent people,
he turned them into his own kind,
thus spreading his evil dominion ever wider.
The attempts to find and destroy this evil
were never proven completely successful.
And so, the search contis to this very day.
What's the time?
Good.
Your crosses.
Put them on.
Here's the key.
Thank you.
Let us know as soon as the sun clears the edge of the hill.
Yes, sir.
Take off the top.
Just a few seconds more.
Now!
He's gone!
But where?
Where?
I don't know, but wherever he is, he must be found.
Now, Frieda,
Frieda please.
You only make it more difficult.
At least in America
I will be welcome.
I can paint life as I see it.
An artist must have some kind of expression.
I know.
Life is filled with goodbyes, huh?
Tell Cora to feed you well, huh? Yeah, I will.
You will like
America, Bellac.
You are lucky to be free.
Yeah, I know.
Well, goodbye.
Bye.
Excuse me, please.
What? What did you say?
Hey, Nugget! Nugget!
Nugget!
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
Here, kitty.
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
Nugget, where are you?
Gosh, Nugget, what are you doing down there?
Quit playing games, Nugget.
I got to go now.
I'll come get you later.
You hear that?
Yeah.
Number 62 is sure early tonight.
Tim! Hey, Tim!
The train's coming!
Are you sure?
I just heard it.
You better go and tell them. I am.
Mom! Mickey, how many times must I tell you not to slam that door?
But, Mom...
Mom, the train's coming in!
Oh, it can't be.
It isn't due for half an hour.
Are you sure?
I just heard it, Mom.
Oh, my goodness! Come on. Get your coat now.
Hurry up, Mom, and don't forget your hat!
I swear you're getting under my feet.
Hey, Rach, the train's early!
Oh, I'm coming!
Oh, the veil's all wrong.
Did anybody tell Tim?
I did. Look out, Mom. Move over.
Mickey, must you stand in front of me? Please!
Okay.
Oh, come on, Mama.
Look at that.
My hands are so shaky.
After all, he's only a relative, part of the family.
Think of it, a man like that part of us.
A man who's been all over the world and seen everything and done everything.
I just can't believe it's happening to me.
I hope he likes cheese sauce on asparagus.
Of course he does.
Now, come on, Mama.
It's not my fault the train's early.
What's keeping them? Come on!
Hurry!
Aren't you going to wear a coat? What for?
Never mind.
Get in the car, Mickey.
I'll ride in front with Rachel.
I sure hope Nugget'll be okay in that cave.
Of course he will.
Stop worrying.
Hi, Mel.
Evening, Mrs. Mayberry.
Evening, Cora.
Good evening, Eddie.
Was that the 6:30 that just came through?
Yes, 20 minutes early today.
I couldn't believe it.
Never happened before.
My cousin, Bellac Gordal, is due in from Europe, you know.
Tonight?
Yes.
Then he must've missed his connection. No passengers, Cora.
Just this freight.
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm positive.
I can't understand it.
Wasn't there a telegram?
Well, I don't think so, but I'll check.
Well, if he missed this train, maybe he'll be on the next one.
I hope so.
Cora.
Bellac?
Bellac!
Oh, for goodness sakes. I can't believe you're really here.
I never would have recognized you!
Why, the last time
I saw you, you were just a little boy.
This is my son, Mickey.
Hello, Mickey.
And my daughter, Rachel.
Oh, captivated.
And Tim, who lives next door to us.
How do you do?
How do you do?
I feel as if I've always known you, cousin Bellac, ever since you sent me the drawing.
Oh, yes.
Do you still have it?
Of course.
I can't wait to hear all about the family.
It's been such a long, long time.
The car's right over here.
Did you see that fella get off the train?
No, sir.
Neither did I.
I've got to get
Nugget, Ma.
Now, Mickey, I don't want you to go in those caves.
It's too dark there.
But, Ma, that's where he went to.
Mickey.
Into the house.
All right.
This is your house?
Why, yes.
When my husband died,
I thought about selling it.
Oh, no, you mustn't.
Why, it's charming.
It has a feeling of the Old World.
Just like you do, Cora.
You must never sell it.
I shall prevent it.
Oh, Bellac,
I'm so glad you've come.
I had my misgivings.
I'll have to admit I did.
But it's going to be fine having a man in the house again.
Now, that's what you call a real snow job.
What?
Those two.
The trouble with you is you just don't appreciate graciousness.
And you do?
Yes.
You can tell he's refined just by looking at him.
Is that so?
Yes.
And what can you tell by looking at me, for instance?
That I shouldn't trust you.
I'll see you later?
Oh, I can't. The Reverend is coming to dinner.
Oh, well, okay.
Rachel.
What?
Okay.
Good night.
Delicious!
More pie, Doctor?
Couldn't possibly.
I'm sorry Bellac hasn't come down.
You know, when he was a little boy, he used to do the same thing.
He'd lock himself up in his room for hours to think and create.
Now Rachel is exactly the same way.
Oh, Mother.
Well, it's the truth.
Mickey, what do you say?
Excuse me.
Quite all right.
Rachel, why don't you go up and ask cousin Bellac if he'd like some pie.
All right.
Oh, excuse me, Doctor.
Certainly, Rachel.
You know, Doctor, when Frieda and Bellac and I were younger, my father used to take us to the art gallery every Saturday.
Come in, Rachel.
Don't you want any dinner?
Mother made a wonderful blueberry pie, and the Doctor's so anxious to meet you.
I have already dined.
Oh, of course, on the train.
We were afraid you weren't feeling well.
On the contrary,
I feel quite excellent.
I only hope that your family will understand certain things about me.
You see my...
My life has been confined.
That's why I've come here.
For freedom.
I must have it.
We understand.
Perhaps I will grow to learn your ways in time, but until I do,
I may seem strange to you.
A recluse.
You must have been terribly unhappy.
Unhappy?
Why do you say that?
Well, I...
I read all the letters you wrote, cousin Bellac.
I've kept them.
I'd re-read them, and pretty soon it was as if it were happening to me, almost.
I could feel the pain you felt, and how you wanted to express yourself, but couldn't.
I know how that is. I feel the same way, too, sometimes.
You sound like an artist.
Are you?
Well, I am in a way.
I'd like to be a dress designer.
But I guess
I'll end up being a nurse.
How are these two opposites reconciled?
Well, I guess they aren't yet.
I'm sure they will be.
Seems to me you are a most remarkable girl.
Thank you.
Come.
We shall join the honorable doctor.
Oh, the mirror.
Oh, is it broken?
Leave that alone.
What? Oh,
I'm so sorry.
Forgive me, I cannot stand any mirrors in my room.
It is a quirk of mine.
You will have to indulge me.
Of course.
That was the best blueberry pie I ever tasted.
Thank you, Doctor.
I'm glad you liked it.
Oh, Doctor, you're not leaving?
I just talked cousin Bellac into coming down.
I'm afraid I have to get back to the parish house, Rachel.
Oh, that's too bad.
This is my cousin,
Bellac Gordal.
A pleasure. I've heard a great deal about you, Mr. Gordal.
Yes?
I hear you're an accomplished painter, among other things.
Yes.
Well, you'll find our town most picturesque.
I'm sure I will.
You must bring him to the parish house sometime, Rachel.
Oh, I will.
This one is a real treasure.
You should see how the patients respond to her.
I'm sure even the devil would respond.
Yes, yes,
I'd say he would.
Well, I must go.
It was a wonderful dinner, Cora. Thank you.
I'm looking forward to seeing you again, Mr. Gordal.
You can count on it.
Tomorrow night, Rachel,
Jennie is expecting you.
Oh, I'll be there.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night, Doctor.
Good night.
Can't I get you something? No, thank you.
Oh, he already ate dinner, Mama.
Well, then, help me clear the table, dear.
Mom?
In here, dear.
I couldn't find Nugget anywhere. I looked all over.
Do you suppose he's all right?
Oh, of course he is, dear.
He'll turn up. Don't worry.
I'm late. What time is it?
Quarter past.
Rachel?
Uh?
Do you suppose you could cut classes today?
Why?
Well, I thought it'd be nice if you showed cousin Bellac the countryside.
Oh, Ma, I'd love it.
I've got all those costumes to sew for the party, and, besides, he seems to like your company.
And, you know, there are a lot of places he could paint.
There's the bridge and the caves, even the old manor house.
Where's Mickey? Oh, he's out looking for that cat.
Hey, Nugget! Nugget!
Ma, do you think he'll wake up early?
I have a thousand things to tell him.
Say, do you think he might help me with my designing?
Well, I don't see why not.
Why don't you ask him?
Oh, I will.
And you know what?
Twenty five years from today, I'll come back to this small, dull town from Paris, and I'll say,
"I owe all my success to cousin Bellac.
"He inspired me in my youth."
Oh, you.
Ma!
You'll wake cousin Bellac.
Ma! What's the matter? What happened?
Nugget, he's dead.
Oh, darling, I'm so sorry.
How'd it happen?
In the cave.
He had blood all over him.
Oh, there, there, dear.
Something killed him!
Stop your crying.
You'll make yourself sick.
Something killed him, Mom!
Oh, there, darling.
It's all right.
Please. There, there.
I'll be back in half an hour.
Don't you think we ought to wake him, Mama?
Now, Rachel, you're much too impatient. He needs his rest.
But it's almost 12:00.
I know, but he needs his sleep.
Now, we'll try this on when I get back.
Okay.
Cousin Bellac.
Cousin Bellac. It's Rachel.
Are you asleep?
Mom, where do you suppose he is?
I don't know, honey.
At least he could have told us he was going out.
I waited all day.
I know, dear.
We'll just have to leave him alone, and it'll take time.
But we don't want him to feel obligated to us, do we?
Mama, you're right.
Don't be too late.
I won't.
Good night.
Good night.
Rachel.
Are you going somewhere?
It's my night at the parish house.
Ah, yes, the artist by day, the nurse by night.
Come with me. I'd love to have you meet everyone.
I'm afraid I can't, not tonight.
Well, some other time.
Oh, were you painting today?
Yes.
I wanted to show you a few places around town. I guess you left early.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Well, it doesn't matter.
Sometime, will you come with me and talk to Jennie?
She's a blind girl, and you could describe things to her.
Oh, I know she'd love to meet you.
You are truly an angel of mercy, aren't you?
No, I just know how terrible it must be to be alone like Jennie is, especially in the dark.
Yes.
Well, upon your recommendation,
I shall make it a point to visit her sometime.
Oh, that's wonderful!
Well, I have to go now.
I'm so glad you're back.
We worried.
Good night.
Good night.
This is the menu we're planning for tomorrow, Doctor.
Hello, Doctor.
Hello, Rachel!
I've invented a new game for the party.
Oh, that's wonderful,
Cornelia.
Jennie's been asking for you.
She isn't feeling well again.
Oh, but Rachel.
Excuse me.
Rachel?
Uh-huh.
How do you feel? Oh,
I'm all right, I guess.
Did your cousin come yet?
Yes, and he's wonderful.
He's promised to visit you soon.
He's such a nice person.
Now, let's see, where were we yesterday?
The soldier had just gotten lost, and then he heard someone.
It was the girl and she kissed him.
Rachel.
Yes?
Talk with me a minute.
Okay.
Rachel, I have the funniest feeling.
I feel as if
I'm going to die.
Oh, Jennie, that's silly and you know it.
Is it?
Well, of course it is.
I don't think it's silly.
Some nights, some nights are darker.
Some are almost black, Rachel.
Like tonight, it seems so dark.
And I'm scared.
I'm scared of being alone.
Oh, Jennie, you know you're not alone.
No.
I'm not.
What was that?
It's just the dogs.
No, I mean at the window.
At the window?
The wind's blowing, that's all. I'll lower it a little.
I thought I heard something.
It was just the wind.
Now, let's see.
"As he entered the drawing room,
"his heart beat violently and his hands trembled so perceptibly
"that he clasped them behind his back.
"Raising his eyes from the stream and gazing at the sky,
"he recalled how fate, in the shape of an unknown woman,
"had once caressed him."
Jennie?
Jennie?
She's asleep.
That's fine.
Why don't you go on home, Rachel?
We're all turning in early.
You look a little tired.
Oh, I am.
And when Tim comes, tell him I've gone, will you?
Of course, and try not to worry too much about Jennie.
I won't. Good night.
Good night.
What?
What did you say?
Hi, what are you doing up there?
What?
I don't know.
Did you get through early?
Yes.
What?
What did you say?
I said look at me, Jennie.
Open your eyes and look at me.
You can see me if you try.
You can see me with your mind.
I can free your soul, Jennie.
I can take you from the blackness into the light.
Look at me, Jennie.
Can you see me now?
Yes.
Yes.
Hello?
Yes, Doctor.
Of course.
Well, she's just leaving for school.
Yes, I'll tell her.
All right. Goodbye.
Oh, Rachel, the doctor wants you to stop by the parish house.
Well, now?
Yes, it's something about Jennie.
Oh, all right. Bye-bye.
Bye.
You're late!
I'm sorry.
Listen, we've got to go by the parish house. Jennie's worse.
That's too bad.
Let's go.
Come on, get in!
How's your cousin these days?
My cousin has nothing to do with your manners, which are crude, to say the least.
Well, that's not what you said last night.
Oh, shut up.
Jennie is very sick.
I know.
She's been calling for you.
Jennie, it's me.
I don't think she can hear you, Rachel.
Jennie,
Rachel's here.
Rachel?
Yes, Jennie.
Rachel, what happened after he kissed her?
She ran out, and he didn't know what she looked like because it was so dark.
Oh, Rachel, I know what he looked like. What?
I saw him.
Rachel, I've got to give you something. You've got to take it.
You know him.
Who?
Is the window open?
No, Jennie, it's closed.
I've got to close the window.
He's outside. He'll hear us.
No, Jennie.
Rachel.
Now, Jennie, you mustn't get up.
I've got to!
Don't you understand?
I've got to close the window!
He's outside. He'll hear us.
I've got to close the window!
I'm sorry.
She's gone.
No.
Jennie! Jennie!
And so, it is not for us to question, but to accept.
Each life concludes.
Each life renews.
And herein lies our faith, and the faith of all flesh.
Amen.
Thanks, Tim. I'll see you a little later.
Mrs. Mayberry?
Yes.
My name is Mack Bryant. I'm from the Department of Immigration.
Yes? I wonder if I might speak to you.
Why, of course.
Won't you come in?
Thank you.
You'll have to forgive us, Mr...
Bryant.
Mr. Bryant.
We just came back from a funeral.
It was very depressing.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I hope it was no one close.
No, a little girl we all knew and loved.
She'd been ill a long time.
Well, what can I do to help?
Well, it's in regard to your cousin, Mr. Gordal.
Is he at home?
No, he isn't. He's been away for a few days.
I see.
Something wrong?
Oh, this is my daughter,
Rachel, Mr. Bryant.
How do you do?
How do you do?
No, I'm checking on all the immigrants that entered with his group.
Just routine.
Do you know when he'll be back?
Well, that's very hard to say.
I can never tell about him.
He keeps very irregular hours.
Do you happen to know if your cousin would have his papers here at the house?
What kind of papers?
Alien registration card.
Entry papers.
Well, I don't know, but they're probably in his room.
Would you be kind enough to look? It's rather important.
Well, I...
But why do you want to see his papers?
An unidentified man was thrown from a train over in Europe.
He happened to be traveling with an immigration group.
We're just checking through in the event that some of his papers were stolen.
Well, I suppose it's all right, but I do so dislike invading someone's privacy.
You understand?
Of course.
Won't you sit down?
Thank you.
Bellac?
Bellac?
Oh, for goodness sakes.
You scared me half to death!
I didn't know you were back.
I just came in.
There's a man downstairs that wants to see you about your papers.
What's his name?
Bryant. Mack Bryant.
He's from the
Immigration Department.
Tell him I'll be right down. All right.
Did you have a nice trip?
I rested.
That's good.
We do worry about you.
Well, everything seems to be in order, Mr. Gordal.
I hope I haven't inconvenienced you too much.
Oh, no not at all.
In my country I am used to it.
Yes, I guess that's one of the big differences between our countries.
You see, over here we don't like to investigate a man unless it's absolutely necessary.
Oh, cigarette, sir?
No, thanks.
You care if I do?
Oh, no, go ahead.
Where did you study art,
Mr. Gordal?
At the Paris
Institute.
That would be under Rondeau?
No, Marchand.
Have you ever been hospitalized?
No.
Well, what about your appendix, dear, when you were 10?
Oh, yes.
Do you remember the doctor's name?
It was so long ago.
The family doctor?
Baregi.
But I thought Uncle Freddie took care of all of you.
No, it was Doctor Baregi.
Well, thank you ever so much,
Mr. Gordal, for your cooperation, and I'm sorry I gave you so much trouble.
It's quite all right.
Would you like some tea?
No, thanks. I have a train to catch. Nice to have met all of you.
Well?
No, I don't think so.
Why not?
Well, everything seems okay, but I'll run a check on the questionnaire anyway.
Did you take a picture?
Yeah, got it with a lighter camera.
Hey, what are you so interested in this one for, anyway?
We still got a long list of names.
No special reason.
Only that he was also an artist of sorts.
It seems like a happy coincidence.
When is the train out?
Take it.
I think I'll stay over night.
Perhaps I can have a look at the paintings, and have this film developed. Right.
Well, there's only one thing wrong.
That we are defeated before we have begun.
Why?
The facets, my dear fellow.
A wolf, a man, a bat, the possibilities are infinite.
There's only one thing he cannot change, between sunrise and sunset he has to lie in his coffin.
Well, I'll drop you off at the hotel so you can pack.
And we'll meet later at the station.
Anything you say.
Hey, he didn't suspect anything? Oh, no.
Good.
Jennie.
Jennie.
Jennie. I have come to wake you, Jennie.
Jennie. Jennie.
Wake, Jennie.
Wake.
Rise up, Jennie.
Rise up and breathe.
That's right.
It hurts to breathe again, but only for a moment.
Now, Jennie.
Now.
Come.
We have work to do.
Oh, stationmaster, the
Yes, sir, she'll be along in 20 minutes or so.
Thank you.
Mr. Bryant?
Please help me.
Help me, Mr. Bryant.
Please help me.
Oh, stationmaster, wasn't there another passenger waiting?
A medium sized man, about five foot ten?
Yes, there was somebody waiting just a little while ago.
Did you notice where he went?
Don't know for sure. That's his suitcase sitting right there.
Ed!
Ed!
Ed, call the Sheriff!
What's wrong? There's a fellow on my place. He's dead.
Looks like he's been killed by an animal!
An animal?
Yeah.
Where? Show me where.
All right, folks, let's stand back a little, please.
Sheriff Bicknell?
Yes?
Mr. Bryant here was working with me.
Oh, yes?
It was an animal, all right.
There isn't any doubt of it.
I don't see how that's possible.
It is quite possible.
May I have a word with you, Sheriff?
I'm afraid I have to ask for your utmost cooperation and discretion.
Who are you?
This is a matter we best discuss in private.
The Sheriff asked that I help you in any way possible.
I understand that you serve as a county health supervisor.
That's right.
I would like to review the circumstances connected with the deaths in your community during the past three weeks.
I'll get the records.
Practically everybody in this town dies of natural causes.
Of course, there was that fellow who was attacked last night.
Here you are,
Mr. Meiermann.
Thank you, sir.
Do you think I should wear my hair up for the party or down?
Well, Grecian women were the epitome of fashion, didn't you know?
No kidding.
And they made slaves out of their men.
I am your slave.
I don't think you're interested in history at all.
I'm fascinated. What else did Grecian women do?
Well, they fell in love with educated men.
Here, read!
Hey, come here.
Hey, be quiet!
You'll wake up Mother!
Oh, Tim, stop it.
Teacher, you're setting a bad example.
Good evening.
Listen, I've got to go and invite him to the party.
Now?
Why not?
Well, if you don't know,
I'm not gonna tell you.
Oh, stop it.
Hey.
Cousin Bellac?
Yes.
Mother wanted me to invite you to the party tomorrow night.
Party? At the parish house for Halloween.
We'd love to have you come.
I'm afraid not.
But you have to.
I designed the costumes, and I'd like you to look at the sketches and tell me what's wrong.
You'd know, being a true artist.
Of course I shall look at your sketches, Rachel, but you will have to excuse me from the party.
I have no, how do you say, social grace for large gatherings.
Cousin Bellac, have we offended you?
Offend?
I thought at first we were going to be such good friends.
Aren't we?
I don't know.
You seem so distant somehow.
I don't think you've given us a chance, and we want to accept you very much.
And there's a price for your acceptance, for me to conform, to be as you would want me to be.
I didn't mean that at all.
Well, you must accept me as I am.
Do not question.
You study me with such puzzled eyes.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.
If my behavior seems different, perhaps it is because it serves a higher purpose than to find acceptance in this dull and useless world.
I'm afraid
I don't follow you.
Of course you don't.
But you will in time, for you are a very sensitive and intelligent young lady.
So, you see, you've not offended me, and we are good friends, huh?
I'm so glad.
Where did you receive that pendant about your throat?
It was Jennie's.
It does not become you.
I wouldn't wear it if I were you.
Hey, Rach, you got company, remember!
Coming.
Please, please look at the sketches and... Of course.
Change your mind about the party.
Do you have to yell at everybody?
You act like you were born in a corncrib!
So I'm uninhibited. So?
Okay, you are uninhibited.
Hey, come on!
I'm tired.
You weren't tired five minutes ago until that phony cousin of yours walked in.
That's very funny.
Okay.
Where are you going?
I'll see you later.
The cross is my enemy, Rachel.
Take it off.
Take off the cross, Rachel, then we can speak.
I must speak with you.
What?
The cross.
The cross.
You will do as I say.
Yes.
You are not afraid?
No.
There's only one reality,
Rachel, and that is death.
I bring you death, a living death.
Are you afraid?
No.
I bring you the darkness of centuries past and centuries to come.
Eternal life and eternal death.
Now do you fear?
No.
Mickey.
Don't you ever do that again!
Get up, will you, Rachel?
Gotta help Mom finish making the costumes.
And Tim's downstairs.
All right,
I'll be right down.
Here.
Well, I thought you were going to sleep all day.
What's the matter, don't you feel well?
I'm tired, that's all.
There's orange juice in the ice box.
All right.
Finish wrapping this, huh, Mickey?
Hi.
Oh, hi.
Rach, I'm sorry about last night.
Last night? Sometimes
I'm a real jerk, I guess.
I lose my temper.
Well, you know what I mean.
It's all right.
Is it? I wonder.
Tim.
Yeah?
Do I look all right?
I feel so strange.
You look great. Of course,
I'm no judge. I'm used to you.
I mean, seriously.
You look all right.
Kind of pale, I guess.
I had the strangest dream last night.
But I...
I can't seem to remember.
It was about Bellac.
I wonder how Jennie is.
Honey, Jennie's dead.
Is she?
Yes, of course.
You were gonna tell me about the dream.
Well, I... I dreamt I was lying asleep and...
Mom wants to know if you're gonna help her or not.
She's waiting.
Come on. Let's go.
Excuse me.
My name is Meiermann.
May I speak to
Dr. Whitfield, please?
Come in.
Thank you.
Right this way. We are having a party, you know, for Halloween.
Oh, yes.
Come right this way.
The doctor's study is in here.
Doctor?
Yes.
There's a Mr. Meiermann here to see you.
I'm going as a witch.
I beg your pardon?
To the party.
Oh, I see.
Mr. Meiermann.
Doctor.
Sheriff Bicknell called me, said you were stopping by.
Sit down, please.
Thank you, sir.
I hesitated coming to you,
Doctor, but there doesn't seem to be a choice, unfortunately.
I've spent all day yesterday verifying my information.
Well, I try to serve the community.
Their problems are my problems, so to speak.
Yes. Actually I... This is rather difficult to explain.
I have come to you on two counts.
First, I want your help in getting the permission to open the crypt of Jennie Blake.
Jennie's crypt. But why?
That brings me to my second reason for confiding in you in particular.
I understand you've done some studying abroad, in the Balkans?
That is correct.
But what has that got to do with Jennie?
Perhaps you're familiar with the legend of the undead?
The undead?
Oh, yes, of course, the Dracula legend.
Only that it isn't a legend.
It is fact.
Fact?
Yes, sir.
I have devoted a great many years of my life to proving it. It is fact.
Are you...
Are you serious?
I have never been more serious, sir.
One of the undead, possibly
Count Dracula himself, has escaped to this country.
It is my firm belief that he is now residing in this town, posing as a relative of the Mayberry family, with a sole purpose of starting a new chain of domination here.
Oh, no.
No, you must be mistaken.
Furthermore,
I have examined very carefully the recent deaths in this community.
And it is my belief that Jennie Blake did not die from natural causes, but as a victim of the so-called Bellac Gordal.
And that she's following the cycle now, and is, herself, undead.
But why? Why do you believe such a thing?
What proof do you have?
This is a picture that was taken of Mr. Gordal two days ago.
I don't understand.
Your photographer must have made a mistake.
My photographer is dead, sir.
He was killed shortly after taking this picture.
We are dealing with the supernatural.
If I am correct,
Mr. Gordal's flesh is as transient as his background.
How can I help you?
Tonight we will open
Jennie Blake's crypt.
If she is undead, then my theory about
Mr. Gordal will be correct.
And if you are correct?
Jennie Blake's soul must be freed.
And all the souls of their victims, if any.
But how?
With a wooden stake right through her heart.
Let's go, Mickey.
Now, don't forget the belts. I won't.
And Cornelia's hat.
And if Bellac comes in, ask him again to the party.
I think he'd enjoy it.
I do so wish we could reach him.
All right, I'll try.
Here I am, Mom.
Aren't you going to wear a costume, Mickey?
What does she mean by that?
Rachel.
Now, dear, you look very cute.
Come on, let's go.
Cousin Bellac?
Cousin Bellac?
Cousin Bellac?
Tim? Oh, Tim, please come over right now.
There's something
I've got to show you.
Yes, right now.
Cousin Bellac!
I was just going to telephone Tim. I...
That's right.
There is no reflection.
The flesh is only an illusion.
The heart beats only when it is drunk with blood.
What are you?
I think you know.
I think you remember.
Yes, I remember.
That's Tim.
Well, we shall let him in.
Yes?
Yes.
Where is she?
In there.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
What do you mean, nothing? You just had a stroke on the phone.
I just wanted you to see my dress.
For Pete's sake, Rachel, I thought you were dying. Don't do that again.
Oh, cousin Bellac.
Yes.
Mother didn't want you to forget to come to the party.
Perhaps later.
Yes, later.
Later.
That's right, folks, have some fun.
I want everybody to have a real good time.
I want it to be a real big party.
Have a cookie, they're real good.
Why, Mickey, who are you supposed to be?
Women!
Are you lost in thought or just bored to death?
What?
Where are you?
Rachel.
Yes?
I want to talk to you for a few minutes in my study.
All right.
Excuse me, Tim.
Rachel, this is
Mr. Meiermann.
He's visiting our town for a few days.
How do you do,
Miss Mayberry?
How do you do?
Sit down, dear.
Rachel, we have some information that may concern you.
Mr. Meiermann is from the European Police Authority.
Now, don't be alarmed.
We aren't sure, but there's a possibility, mind you, I said a possibility, that your cousin Bellac is not all that he says he is.
Cousin Bellac?
We're not sure, and we don't want to make unjust accusations until we are sure.
What are you talking about?
Now, there's no cause for concern.
That's why I don't want you to upset your mother.
But just for tonight, just until we're sure, we want you both to stay here at parish house.
Why?
You'll have to trust me.
Is that too much to ask?
It's very important.
I trust you, Doctor.
Thank you.
Make up some excuse.
Tell her that we need you to help out here tonight.
I'll explain everything tomorrow, I promise you.
All right, I'll ask her.
Goodbye, Mr. Meiermann,
I was happy to meet you.
Likewise, Miss Mayberry.
I can't tell you how wretched
I feel about this whole thing.
I wish I could be sure it wasn't a mistake.
I just don't want to take a chance on the Mayberry family.
If I'm wrong about Jennie Blake, and we'll find out shortly, then I'm wrong about Mr. Gordal.
I sincerely hope I am.
But it doesn't look that way.
Well, we might as well go and get this over with.
Hey, hey, let's finish our dance, huh?
Later, Tim.
Rachel, we're going to judge the costumes now.
I have to go,
Cornelia.
Come on, now. Everybody is waiting. Come on, honey.
Come on, now, everybody gather around.
We're gonna judge the costumes.
And the one that has the best costume is going to get a prize.
Open it.
I can't believe it!
It seems like some sort of grotesque joke.
Close it and put it back.
What can we do?
We'll wait for her to come back.
She will.
She has to before sunrise.
Let's wait outside.
It's best not to be too close.
We don't want to frighten her away.
I just can't believe it!
Attention, everybody!
I want it real quiet now because I'm going to give the prize to the best costume.
And I've got a great big surprise for you.
You come right over here.
How do you like this, folks?
Isn't it lovely? Look at all the filigree on it.
Rachel designed it.
Oh, isn't it beautiful? Look at all the filigree on it.
Let's give her a great big hand now.
Oh, Mrs. Welch, you look so wonderful.
Oh, I think this dress is so beautiful.
Everybody's made it so nice, you know.
Oh, I think it's just grand.
Rachel, where are you going?
What's the matter?
Nothing. I'm going home.
That's all.
Wait a minute. They haven't even given the prizes out yet.
I don't care.
You don't care? Now, what's that supposed to mean?
Look, Rachel, if something's the matter, tell me.
I've never seen you this way before. Will you stop a minute?
Let go of me.
I'm just trying to talk to you.
Go away, I mean it.
Go away!
Okay!
There she is.
God save us.
Take it out.
Open up.
She's paralyzed as long as the cross is there.
No! We've made a mistake!
She's alive.
We've buried her alive.
You know better.
You know what she is, and you know what we have to do.
May... May I pray for her first?
Of course.
And the fairest of the fair, fair Rachel.
They found out about Jennie.
They're waiting for her.
Oh, yes?
Well, let them find her.
She has fulfilled her purpose.
We shall never be touched.
The world shall spin and they all shall die, but not we.
I...
I don't know.
You only fear the unknown.
Only this casing, this clumsy flesh, stands between you and me.
You are already balanced between two worlds.
Eternity awaits you now.
Throw away that cross, Rachel.
Cast it on the ground.
You shall rise reborn in me.
Rachel! Rachel!
Rachel, are you all right?
Get me away from here.
What happened?
It's Bellac!
Get me away before it's too late!
Honey, you are gonna be all right.
What's that?
I don't know.
I'm cold.
Is it cold in here?
Just a little.
Tim, if I died and you should live...
You won't die. Then you've got to promise me.
I don't wanna become like him.
What are you talking about?
Promise me.
Honey, we'll get you to a doctor. You'll be all right.
No, you've got to promise me!
Bellac.
Don't go near him. He'll kill us. He'll kill us both!
My poor child,
I've come to help you.
You are not yourself, Rachel.
You must trust me.
She has had a great shock.
Her mind has undergone a strange metamorphosis.
Don't listen to him!
I'm taking Rachel home.
Yes, of course, let me assist you.
No! Take the cross!
Why?
It's the only way!
Her sickness has caused wild imaginings, wild fantasies.
I will not harm you.
Put down the cross, Tim.
We must help Rachel.
We must combine our strength for her good, you and I.
Our destiny must be fulfilled here.
We three are the only ones to survive this dying world.
Don't listen to him.
That's right.
Put down the cross.
It is only a burden, huh?
And your arm, it feels like leaden weight.
Don't listen to him.
Don't listen to him!
Get out of the way.
No! No, you must listen to me.
You must listen to what I say.
You cannot leave.
You are bound to me.
You shall die as you are bidden to die!
Get out of the way!
It's all right.
We're all right.
Don't look, honey.
He's gone.
Beware of the Blob
It creeps and leaps
And glides and slides across the floor
Right through the door and all around the wall
A splotch, a blotch
Be careful of the Blob
Beware of the Blob
It creeps and leaps
And glides and slides across the floor
Right through the door and all around the wall
A splotch, a blotch
Be careful of the Blob
Beware of the Blob

No.
Well, it's a shooting star.
I thought you were supposed to wish on shooting stars.
- But I did.
- We only saw one.
- But you see a lot of 'em up here at night.
- What?
Well, I mean, there'sa lot of 'em out at night.
You don't see 'em in town.
That's why I come up here.
Oh, no, that's not what I mean.
- I mean, you can see 'em better up here...
- I know what you mean, Steve.
No, no, it's not what you think, 
Janey girl.
My name is Jane.
Just Jane.
For a little while, I thought that "shooting star" business wasn't just part of your line.
But it's not, Janey gir...
Jane, I've never brought anyone up here before.
Never?
Never.
Well, I may be crazy, but... 
I believe you.
Well, you're not crazy.
Boy, that was close!
Come on. 
I want to see if I can find it.
Shut up.
Get back inside.
Get back in there.
Huh. Huh.
I could've sworn it landed just over this hill.
Maybe it's like lightning. Sometimes you think it's striking right next door, and it's really miles away.
No, I still think it's close by.
Well, do you want to go back and try the other road?
No. Um... um... well, I'm sorry about the bumpy ride.
It's all right, Steve.
Well, listen, why don't we go back to town and I'll apologize.
I'll apologize over a sandwich.
I mean, on me.
- Okay?
- Okay.
Steve, watch out!
- What was that?
- It looked like an old man.
Where'd he go?
Hey, you okay?
Oh! Take me to a doctor!
- What's the matter?
- I can't get it off!
- Well, here, let me try. Maybe I can get it off.
- No! You can't!
Okay. Come on.
We'll get you in the car.
- Yeah, okay, get in.
- It hurts.
Take it easy, now.
Here, better put this on.
Take it easy.
We'll get you there as fast as we can.
Boy, I hope the doctor's in.
Mrs. Porter, Dr. Hallen.
I'm leaving now.
Yes, I'll be back tomorrow night, probably late.
No, I haven't forgotten anything.
Ye-Yes, I'll be fine.
Look, Mrs. Porter, if you'll just keep your eye on the house while I'm gone.
Thank you.
Good-bye.
Come on!
- Hey, who's the cowboy?
- That's no cowboy. That's Steve Andrews.
- What?
- Yeah, that's his container. It's a real dog.
Well, he can't do that to us.
Hey, Doc.
It's all right. Come on.
Watch his hand.
Hey, Doc Hallen, this man's been hurt.
Well, come on in.
Wanna get the door?
In there.
What's the matter with him?
I... I don't know.
He got something on his hand.
- What do you mean?
- Well, we ran into him down on the Old North Road.
- Ran into him?
- No, Doc, we picked him up out on the road.
He was screaming about this thing on his hand.
Let's take a look.
Take it easy, old-timer.
- What is it he's got on his hand?
- I don't know, Doc.
It was kind of like... well, a big blister on his fingers, you know?
Easy, now. Easy.
How are we gonna help you if you don't let us see it?
Doc! It's gotten bigger.
It was just on his hand before.
Cover him with this, please.
I've got to give him something.
Take it easy, old-timer.
Everything's gonna be all right.
- Steve, uh, you know who he is?
- Huh?
- Do you have any idea who he is?
- Oh, no, no.
All right, take it easy.
There we are.
- Steve.
- Huh?
Could you drive out to the place you found him?
See if you can find somebody that knows what happened.
Right. Right.
- Steve?
- Yeah?
Would you turn out the outside light when you go?
- I don't want to be disturbed.
- Sure, Doc. Sure.
What's up?
- Congratulations.
- Yeah? For what?
- "For what?" he says.
- Modest.
Mooch, quick, the crown.
Okay, I give up.
You just beat out the champion, pal.
A little while ago when you came into town.
Oh.
I get it. Well, thanks anyway, but you can keep the crown.
No, no, no.
Wait a minute, Steve.
You just can't stop being the champion like that.
You've gotta meet a challenger.
- You mean you?
- Me?
Did I say anything about a race, guys?
Huh?
Not a word.
All right, look, it's been a ball, you know? But I gotta go.
Yeah... we know how you go.
We're just not so sure you should drive around so fast.
Now look, I just don't have time to prove anything tonight. Do you understand?
Well, who's asking you to prove anything?
We can beat this kiddie car of yours going backwards.
Oh, that's a foregone transfusion.
Okay.
Now you're talkin', king.
And we'll do it just like you said.
- What did I say?
- Backwards.
Huh?
See if you could beat this kiddie car going backwards. 
- To the light.
- Okay. You say when.
Okay.
When!
I told you.
I got to leave now.
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh!
Steve.
All right, what's this all about?
Hi, Dave.
Hey, what's up, huh?
I seem to be missing something.
What's going on?
We're just sitting here waiting for the light.
Oh, you mean that light down there.
Yeah.
And you do know you're on the wrong side of the road?
I don't...
Would you think it was funny if your father... if Jane's father heard you were booked for reckless driving?
Okay, don't bring the fathers into this.
I'll never do it again.
- Do what again?
- Huh?
Do what again?
What-Whatever you think I'm doing, Dave.
Like driving on the wrong side of the road?
Well... yeah, yeah.
Or maybe even driving backwards?
Hey, Dave, that's an idea.
You know that 80 or 90 percent of the accidents are front-end jobs.
You know, in Australia they got airplanes... with the seats set in backwards... so in case you get a collision, they got... no concu...
No good, huh?
Okay... lock me up.
You mean, you were dri...
Why?
What am I gonna do with you kids?
You know I don't wanna haul you in.
No more foolin' around, Dave. 
No, I mean it.
I... swe... I promise.
Right, Jane? Huh?
- Right.
- See?
- No more horseplay.
- No more horseplay, Dave.
- No, no more fooling around.
- Get outta here.
Here they come.
Hey, what happened?
- Sergeant Bert?
- No, no, no. Dave.
- Oh, you're lucky it wasn't Bertsie.
- Yeah, you're not kidding.
- You don't know the half of it.
- What?
- Last night we seen Gig's car parked in front of Nancy's. 
- Listen to this.
So we decided we'd move it, hide it on him.
So we're moving it down the center of the street...
When along comes Sgt. Bert.
So Mooch tells him we can't get it started, you know?
He says, "I don't care. You're blocking traffic. 
Move it out of the way."
So then he gets out of the car, comes over to us... and he's helping us move Gig's car.
Just then, Gig comes out of the house... and he's yelling,
"Who's stealing my car?"
- I thought Bertie would drop his teeth.
- I bet he did.
If Gig didn't cover for us, we would've been in trouble.
Yeah, you know, I'd sure hate to cross Bertie again tonight.
Hey, what happened with you and Dave?
I got a lecture.
Promised to be a good boy.
You know, Dave's a good guy. I think we have been steaming him up a little too much.
There's about two inches of rubber on the street outside Doc's house.
Hey, I almost forgot.
I gotta do something for the doc.
- What?
- I gotta go up and check on some people.
- You wanna come with me?
- Oh, no, man. We're going to the flicks.
- At this time of night?
- Yeah, it's a midnight spook bit.
We got some rumors there'd be some unprotected women in the balcony.
Well, listen, why don't you...
Come on, come with us.
You can go to the movies after.
It'll only take a half hour.
- Come on!
- It's okay with me.
- All right, man, lead the way.
- Okay.
Groverton 4771.
Hello.
Is Dr. Gilpen there?
Dr. Hallen.
Oh, he has?
No, no message.
Thanks. Good-bye.
Hello? 
Kate? Dr. Hallen.
I'm still at the office.
Something's come up. I'll need your help right away. No, you've got to come back.
There's a man here with some sort of a parasite on his arm.
It's assimilating his flesh at a frightening speed.
I may have to get ahead of it and amputate.
No, I... I don't know what it is or where it came from.
Man, look at that, will you?
- What is it?
- Wow, I don't know.
Tony, look.
- Hey, what landed here?
- We must be getting close to the front line.
Hey, why would anybody leave a lantern here?
- I don't know.
- What is it, Steve?
- It's hot.
- Watch it.
- A shooting star?
- Hey, we saw that too!
A real big one, like a skyrocket.
- Oh, yeah, about an hour ago.
- You think this is it?
- I don't know.
- Let me see.
Wow, a real piece of sky.
Here, Mooch.
You mean that this little pebble has been out there hot-roddin' around the universe?
Probably big as the moon when it started.
No kiddin'!
Let me see it, Mooch.
And this is all that's left?
Well, it's all that's here.
I'll bet there is a house close by.
Doesn't sound like a house.
It sounds like a dog.
- Come on, Steve. Let's go look.
- Yeah, sure.
Hey, wait a minute.
Hey, there's a house.
- Hey, real nice.
- You think anybody's here?
Hello? Hello? Doesn't look like there's anybody here at all.
Hey, I can't see anything but just that little dog.
Oh, Steve, open the door and let him out.
Okay. Come on.
- Come on. Come on.
- Come on. Come on.
- Come on, pal.
- Come on. Ohhh. Come on out.
- Doesn't look like anybody was there at all.
- Come on.
I guess it's the old man's dog.
Don't you worry, baby.
You'll be all right.
- Think this is the place?
- It sure looks like it.
This is a cozy spot. 
No neighbors, no cars, no roads, no lights.
Yeah, and no movies.
Come on, you guys, let's get outta here.
Let's go, Mooch.
I guess there's nothing else you can find out here, Steve. 
No, no, I guess not.
Why don't you come with us to the spooky show, huh? You'd like it.
- No, no thanks.
- Ah, you gotta stop takin' everything so serious-like.
Gotta live a little.
You gotta go, you know?
Yeah, Steve, you gotta hang loose, like me.
- Okay, sure, the spook show.
- Come on.
- Let's go, you guys!
- Yeah, comin'.
- Steve?
- Yeah.
- What about the dog?
- I don't know.
I mean, we can't just leave him here.
He'd starve to death.
- Yeah, that's right.
- Couldn't we take him with us?
Sure. I guess that's the least we could do for the old man. Come on, let's go.
Oh, hello, Kate.
Thanks for coming back.
It's okay.
What do you want me to do?
You better take his pulse. 
But don't touch that material on his right hand.
It absorbs flesh on contact, like an acid.
Doctor, where is he?
What do you mean?
Kate, stand still. Don't move.
It must have absorbed the old man completely.
I don't know what this is, but it's got to be killed before it gets any bigger.
- Oh, Doctor, I'm afraid.
- Try to stay as far away from it as you can.
Kate, be calm! 
Now do as I say.
Behind you.
The trichloroacetic acid.
- Throw it!
- Throw it?
Yes, but for heaven's sake, don't get any of it on your hands.
Doctor, nothing will stop it.
A gun. In my den.
I've got to go for it, Kate.
Now try to stay absolutely still.
- Don't go. Don't leave me.
- I'll be right back.
Doctor, come back!
Come back!
Kate, what's the matter?
Kate! Kate, what is it?
Kate!
Kate!
Listen, you stay there, and I'll go in and tell the doc.
- It doesn't look like there's anybody here.
- Yeah.
Well, maybe he took the old man to the hospital. 
Anyway, I'll check.
Okay.
Listen, I'm gonna check in the garage and see if the doc's car is there.
Oh, okay.
Steve. Steve, what's the matter?
Steve, tell me what happened.
- I can't.
- Well, what happened?
- It was so...
- Steve, what is it?
- It's got the doc. It's got...
- What's the matter with him?
Just like the thing on the old man's hand, only it was bigger.
Then it was on his whole head, and then in just a second he disappeared.
- He disappeared?
- He was all gone. He was all gone.
- You know, he just disappeared.
- Steve, what are you talking about?
I'm sorry.
Get in the car, Jane.
Well, what are you gonna do, Steve?
We're gonna go to the police.
They'll know what to do.
Well, we can get someone over there tomorrow. Yeah.
- We'll have someone over there first thing in the morning.
- Well, what's this?
Hey, watch it, Dave.
Don't mix up the pieces.
Ritchie, you old buzzard.
I didn't know you were a chess player.
It's like I've been telling you, Dave.
You're not the only thinker around here.
It's nothing.
Just a hobby, you know?
Well, wait. Wait a minute. I think this is interesting. 
Who do you play with?
Well, late at night when I'm here by myself and things are pretty slow, I...
Well, you gotta do something.
You oughta take up chess.
Loosen up your gray matter a little.
I guess I'd better.
You'll have to teach me, Ritchie.
Sure, Dave.
Anytime.
Dave, Doc Hallen's been killed.
- Doc Hallen? What happened?
- You gotta come now!
Wait a minute, Steve.
Tell us what happened.
I'm trying to tell you.
Now this thing, it killed the doc.
What was it?
Out with it, kid.
Well, it's kind of like a ma...
It's kind of like a mass that keeps getting bigger and bigger.
- Come on, Steve, make sense.
- I know, I know.
Look, Dave, you gotta see this thing to believe what I'm telling you.
Maybe the thing you saw was a... monster?
Yeah, maybe it was.
I don't know.
Hold on, Jim.
Now, what is it, Steve?
A little while ago it was driving backwards, and now it's monsters.
Look, he's not making it up, Dave. 
Honest.
Dave, I'm not kidding. Come on over to the doc's.
You can see it for yourself.
You're crazy if you go.
Can't you see it's a gag?
He says Doc Hallen's dead, Jim.
We've got to check it out.
Let's go.
Ritchie, you mind the store.
Dave, listen...
East Cornwall, Downingtown H.Q.
Downingtown, East Cornwall H.Q.
Q to K-2.
Do I read you right?
Q to K-2?
Roger.
K-9 to KB-5.
Shucks.
"This office will be closed all day Saturday. 
Dr. Hallen."
- Wait a minute.
- What's the matter?
The thing might be in there waiting for you.
- Well, we'll have to take that chance, won't we?
- I'm not kidding.
Dr. Hallen?
Dr. Hallen?
Hmm. Seems to be a short circuit in here.
You got your light?
Everything looks okay.
There. I think this is the room 
I saw him in.
- It's locked.
- I'll see if I can find a key that'll work.
No, the key's already here.
It's been locked from the inside.
Hello?
Who's in there?
Better go around and see if the window's unlocked.
If it isn't, break the glass, come in and unlock the door.
- All right.
- You're not gonna let him do that.
Now, don't worry, Steve. 
Sergeant Bert knows how to handle himself.
And this is the only way to get to the bottom of this.
- I'll see if I can find the fuse box.
- Okay.
Steve, I wonder where the little dog is.
Yeah.
What do you think happened to him?
I don't know.
Well, that's more like it.
This must have been what blew the fuse.
Jim?
Wait till you get a load of this mess!
Ohh.
What about this, Steve?
I don't know, Dave.
But I know I saw the doc.
All right, kid, cut the act.
What really happened here?
- I don't know.
- All of a sudden, your mind is a blank?
- No.
- Steve, are you sure this is the room?
Yes, I'm sure of it.
This has been fired.
But I haven't seen any shot marks around anyplace.
Let me tell you what happened, kid.
You and whoever else was in on this thought you'd put one over on the police.
- So you break in here, you mess the place up...
- Wait a minute, Jim.
The kids couldn't have done this.
You saw for yourself.
The window was locked from the inside, and so was the door.
They rigged it with string. 
It's part of their plan to make us look silly.
I think you're doing that pretty well by yourself, Sergeant.
Steve, was there anybody else with you?
No.
How about when I stopped you over on Morgan Street?
Those kids had nothing to do with this.
- Who were they?
- Why, it was Tony and Mooch.
Those kids? 
Well, there's your answer right there!
They're just the kind of kids to pull a trick like this.
- But this time they've gone too far.
- What goes on out here?
- Land's sakes!
- What are you doing here, Mrs. Porter?
Boy oh boy oh boy! 
Wait till Doctor gets back and sees this!
- Back from where?
- Lieutenant, was it burglars?
We don't know yet.
Where is Dr. Hallen?
Johnsonville.
A medical convention.
You know, I told him this would happen one of these days, the way he leaves everything unlocked.
Of course, it was my fault too.
He asked me to keep an eye on the place.
But that's not true, Dave.
He never left.
I don't think I've had the pleasure.
This is Steve Andrews, Mrs. Porter.
He seems to think the doctor got into some trouble here tonight.
No, sir! 
The doctor don't know anything about this.
He called me just before he left.
He didn't leave. Look, Dave,
I'll bet his car is still in the garage.
Might be. Doctor sometimes goes in somebody else's car.
Dr. Gilpen from over in Groverton.
- Jim, call Dr. Gilpen.
- Right.
- He won't be home.
- Just checking.
Mrs. Porter, did you hear any gunshots tonight?
I sure did!
Tonight and every other night.
The people downstairs have those old movies on their television.
There's always some shooting or screaming.
Whoever this thief was, he didn't have to tear up the place like this.
I feel terrible.
Wait a minute, Mrs. Porter.
I don't want this touched.
Well, I don't want the doctor to come back tomorrow and find the place like this.
- It's bad enough the window's broke and all.
- But, Mrs. Porter...
Now, you boys have your work to do, and I have mine.
There's a criminal walking around out there free as a bird.
You go get him.
Let me clean up here.
Mrs. Porter, you don't understand.
We may want to check here for fingerprints later.
Dr. Gilpen's on his way to Johnsonville.
Did he pick up Dr. Hallen?
I spoke with Mrs. Gilpen, and she said that Dr. Hallen had called around 11:00, just after her husband left, but she thought they were going together.
- Where can we reach them in Johnsonville?
- I didn't ask her that.
St. John's Hotel.
That's where the doctor usually stays.
Well, they should be there in a couple of hours.
We'll leave word to have him call us when he checks in.
Can't I just dust around the fingerprints?
Tomorrow.
Well, let's go, kids.
Dave, this is all wrong.
All right, kid, the show's over. 
It was a cute act, but this time it didn't work.
This locked door business really hung you.
If everything happened like you said, where's the doctor?
And where is this old man?
And where is the big, bad monster?
I don't know.
Hand me that small hammer, will ya?
- Why don't you finish that tomorrow?
- I ain't gonna be here.
I'm goin' on a huntin' trip.
I didn't know you was a hunter.
Neither did I.
We got a little cabin up in the south woods, the boys and me.
And I'm tellin' you, Marty boy, we're goin' up there this weekend, and I'm gonna get so roarin', stinkin', no-good drunk...
I won't be able to see.
Hey, why don't you come with us?
It'll do you some good.
Oh, I don't think Martha would figure it that way.
Do you have to tell your old woman everything? 
Tell her your uncle died.
Tell her you're going away so you can love her more when you get back.
Good night.
Boy, I'm so tired of lookin' at the guts of secondhand cars...
I could spit grease.
You know, Marty, if I didn't get away once in a while, I'd blow a gasket.
When I come in on Monday, if Mr. Johnson looks at me funny just once... just once... you know what
I'm gonna do to him, Marty?
Hey, Marty!
Look, you keep telling me about a monster.
- All I want to do is clear this thing up.
- All right, I agree.
- But I still don't see why you had to call our folks.
- Dave, it's for you.
- What else could I do?
- Well, give us a chance to find out what happened.
You know we didn't tear up Doc's house.
How long have you known me?
All right, I believe you!
But I still don't think you're telling me all you know.
- Oh, Dave.
- Hello? Yeah.
Well, young lady, do you mind telling me where you've been spending the evening?
- Daddy, it's all right.
- Oh, yes, everything's fine.
I always stop by the police station to pick up my daughter.
Don't you realize what this could do to me?
By morning, it will be all over town.
We were just trying to warn people.
After all, I am principal of the high school.
Young man, this is the last time you're ever going to take my daughter out!
Steve didn't do anything wrong!
Mr. Andrews, can you make anything out of all this? I can't.
Take it easy, Mr. Martin. 
We'll straighten everything out. Hello, son.
- Dad, I saw something terrible tonight.
- And nobody'll believe us.
Mr. Martin, Mr. Andrews, uh, apparently Doc Hallen's office was broken into by vandals tonight.
And Steve and Jane seem to know something about it.
Vandals?
My daughter?
Well, you don't think our kids were mixed up in it, do you?
All we know is that they told us something had happened over at Dr. Hallen's house.
We're not accusing anyone of what we found.
We can't be more definite until we contact Dr. Hallen in Johnsonville.
Dad, it isn't vandalism!
Dr. Hallen is dead, and he was killed by some sort of a monster.
Now, I know because I saw it, Dad.
Lieutenant, I want you to know that Steve is not in the habit of telling lies.
If he says he's not mixed up in this vandalism, you can be sure it's the truth.
Did you see this thing too, Jane?
Well... no, not exactly.
Well, look, folks, we'll all know more in the morning after we've called Johnsonville.
I think the best thing now is for all of us to go home and get some sleep.
Maybe it's a good idea, son. 
We can talk about this some more at home.
Sure, Pop.
Get out of the house as fast as you can.
I'll be over.
Maybe Bertie's right.
Maybe this is just a gag like those school fraternities were throwing last year.
Remember how they stitched that bathing suit to the statue of General Hayes?
I don't think this is a gag.
Why didn't you book the kids then?
Why make a big thing of it tonight if we can clear the whole thing up tomorrow?
Boy, if it was Bertie, he'd have them strung up by the thumbs by now.
Maybe he would.
Police department.
Hold on. It's Bertie.
- Hello?
- Dave? 
Yep.
A couple of people thought they heard shots, but weren't sure. 
- Okay, Jim. Doc's place locked up?
- Yeah.
- Check back in, then.
- Right.
We'll get the truth out of those kids if it takes all night.
- I sent the kids home.
- Home? Are you crazy?
Jim, we'll take care of this whole thing tomorrow.
Yes, sir.
Is that all?
Yes, that's all.
Bertie got some idea what this is?
I don't care what Bertie's ideas are!
He acts like we're still fighting the war.
Just because some kid smacks into his wife on the turnpike... doesn't make it a crime to be 17 years old!
Okay, so I don't know what the kids are up to tonight.
But I'm not gonna throw them into a cell like a couple of vagrants.
We'll put this puzzle together in the morning.
In the meantime, at least we know where the kids are.
- Hey, where are you going?
- Oh, shhh, Danny.
- Shhh.
- Where are you going?
I've got something very important to do, Danny, but it's got to be a secret.
I won't tell anybody.
I'll go with you.
No, honey, I have to go by myself.
- Will you be back pretty soon?
- Well, I don't know.
Aren't you afraid to go out by yourself?
Yes, I guess I am, Danny.
I'm not afraid.
I'll guard you.
Oh, no, Danny.
You've got a bigger job to do.
You've got to stay here and guard Mommy and Daddy.
Oh, they don't need guarding.
Oh, look, Danny, go on to beddie.
Look, if you go to bed, 
I might bring you a little dog all your very own.
A dog! Honest?
Honest.
I cross my heart.
- Oh, boy!
- Now go on up to bed.
- What's his name?
- Oh, any name you want, Danny.
Can I name him William?
Oh, that's a fine name, Danny.
Now you better run on up to bed.
- Go on.
- Oh, I don't like William.
You run on to bed, honey.
Steve? Steve?
- Was he asleep?
- Yeah.
Do you think he did something wrong?
I don't know. I don't think so.
The police don't either, or they wouldn't have sent him home.
I felt that he was keeping something from us.
He did seem more willing to talk when we were at the police station.
Well, I think tomorrow he might talk and we'll be able to straighten this out.
Maybe, after a good night's sleep.
Yeah. Good night.
'Night, dear.
You scared me to death.
What are you doing here?
Listen, Jane, 
I told you to wait over there.
The folks went to bed, so I thought I should just come on over.
All right, come on.
Let's go around the corner.
- Steve?
- Huh?
Oh, I'm sorry.
At least I could've thanked you for coming out tonight. 
You didn't need to.
I never needed to talk to anyone before, not as much as I do now.
Well, we're in this together, aren't we, Steve?
You know, I wish that we...
I must be getting confused.
I know we saw the old man,
I know we took him to the doc's... and I know the doc sent us out to see if we could find out what happened.
So?
And I know the old man had something on his hand, something he couldn't get off, something that kept getting larger.
I saw that.
And then I...
I think I saw the doc.
He was standing by the window, and he... he was trying to get out... and that thing was all over him... and then... just dissolved while I stood there.
I think I saw this.
I believe you did.
You know, plenty of people in their right mind thought they saw things that didn't exist, you know, like flying saucers.
The light was just right, and the angle and the imagination.
Boy, if that's what it is, then this is just an ordinary night.
You and I are gonna go to sleep, and tomorrow when we get up... that sun's gonna shine, just like yesterday.
Good old yesterday.
Steve, well, you believe you did see it, don't you?
I don't know. I-I...
That's not true, Steve.
Well, maybe, maybe now you don't want to believe it.
Maybe you'd like to tell yourself it didn't happen.
But, Steve, you're not the kind of person who can turn your back... on something you know is true.
I don't know.
Well, you actually did see what happened to Dr. Hallen.
How do you know I did?
Because I know you.
Okay.
Now what do we do?
How do you get people to protect themselves from something they don't believe in?
Well, you keep trying and hoping you can find... some sort of proof that'll convince them.
Okay.
I don't like it much, but I guess the only way you can find that is to go out and look for it.
I'll go get the car.
- You sure you want to go with me?
- Yes.
I wouldn't give much for our chances... wandering around in the middle of the night trying to find something... that if we found it, it might kill us.
If we could only find a couple of people to help us.
Hmm. Who?
Well, your friends,
Tony, Mooch and Al.
Hey, you know, that... that's worth a try.
Yes, I am here, 
the demon who possesses your soul.
Wait a bit.
I am coming for you.
I have so much to show you.
Tony, listen, I wanna see you outside.
Hey, what gives? 
I thought you cats didn't dig spooky shows.
This is important.
Outside.
- Hey, what's up?
- Shhh.
I'll explain outside.
This is important.
You missed most of the picture.
You're not gonna get your money's worth.
None of us are, unless somebody keeps quiet.
You're gotta come with us.
There's nobody else we can go to.
- Okay, you kids, knock it off.
- Come on!
What?
Walk out of the movie?
Let's cut out.
You cats gonna make it?
Not me. I'm part of this chair, and I can't move.
Tsk.
Hold up, Mooch!
Hey, all right, Steve, you made us waste our 80 cents. Now, what gives?
Yeah, what's the scoop?
What's the big idea, Steve?
Would you believe me if I told you there was something inside of that rock we found, something that could wipe out this whole town?
Knock it off!
Go ahead, Steve.
I saw this thing kill Dr. Hallen tonight.
Kill Dr. Hallen?
- That's right.
- Well, what is it?
I don't know.
But one thing's for sure, if it can kill Dr. Hallen, it can kill somebody else.
What do you want us to do, Steve?
All right, we're gonna find this thing, and we're gonna make people believe us.
Let's try Johnsonville again, Ritchie.
- Okay.
- I just saw a strange one.
What do you mean?
On my way back here, 
I ran into Mr. Connors coming outta that bar... in the building he owns over on Second Street.
He'd just stopped in, and there was nobody there.
Queerest thing I've ever seen.
TV was playin' away. The cash register was there with the money still in it.
Nobody around.
No bartender, nobody.
I'll look in there on the way home.
Forget it. 
The place is all locked up now.
Why don't you go home and get some shut-eye?
You can't run our shift and yours too, you know?
Yeah, I know. I wish I knew where those two doctors were, though.
- Any luck, Ritchie?
- Nope, they're not there.
Want me to call the other hotels?
There's a lot of them between here and Johnsonville.
No. I guess you're right. I guess there's nothing here that won't wait till morning.
Well, I'll see you guys.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Well, hello, kids!
Come on in!
You're just in time for the fun.
- We came to warn you.
- Huh? How?
- We came here just to warn you...
- Oh, a warning!
Well, that's fine.
I didn't know you cared.
Hey, folks!
I want you to meet Paul Revere, and this is Mrs. Revere.
They've come to give us a warning about something important.
The British are coming!
Excuse me.
We were just... just looking for a monster.
Monsters? You must've been talking to that guy from Second Street.
Man, I don't know what they're serving over there, but it sure must be great stuff.
Listen, we're trying to tell you.
We don't wanna get served.
Look, I have monsters in here all the time, so beat it.
We don't serve kids anyway.
Where is he?
Over there, in the doorway of your dad's store.
- Come on. Come on.
- Come on. Hey!
That's funny.
The door's not locked.
Do you think it's been open all night?
Well, I don't know.
This is Friday.
The store closes at 10:00, and then old Mr. Weinermeyer sweeps up... and then he collects all the push carts.
Huh. He works around for a couple of hours before he locks up, but I'm sure he'd never be this late, not...
Hey, Mr. Weinermeyer?
Hey, Mr. Weinermeyer, where are you?
I'm gonna turn on the light.
Steve, what is it?
I don't know. Oh.
It's a broom and stuff that Mr. Weinermeyer cleans up with.
It's spread all over the aisle.
What's the matter? Jane!
Here. You all right?
Yes.
Steve!
Oh, Steve, our parents!
They think we're home in bed asleep, sound and safe.
Steve, it's the little dog!
Now listen! Everything's gonna be all right. 
Do you hear me? Now...
It's gonna be all right.
I don't know if we can stop that thing.
- The dog, Steve.
- Take it easy, Jane.
- Oh, Steve, the little dog!
- Don't cry, Jane.
There's nothing we can do about it.
Now, Jane, just put this on.
It'll be all right.
Oh, Steve, what are we gonna do?
I don't know.
That thing probably isn't far away.
We've gotta get out of here before it comes back for us.
Now, come on.
All right?
There they are! 
- Hey, where you kids been?
- Hey, it's in there!
- You're kidding!
- I wish I were kidding. It's in there.
- He got the little dog.
- Oh, you mean the old man's dog.
- We just seen him running down the street.
- Oh, Steve!
- What do we do now?
- We're gonna call the police. They want evidence.
There's a phone at the corner!
- Hmm.
- Go on!
- You talk to him, Tony.
- Me? Why me?
I'm supposed to be home asleep.
If they think I'm loose, they'll never believe us.
Yeah, here's a dime.
Come on. Come on.
- Hey, what'll I say?
- Ask for Dave.
And you give it to him straight. 
You tell him to get out to the store quick.
Tell him to bring every piece of hardware he can find in the police station.
Hello. Police department.
Is... Who's this?
Arthur who?
Is every kid in town in on this?
I don't know who this is, but you're going to wish you'd never thought of this.
Hello? Hello?
Big deal!
I'd like to take that dime...
- Bert?
- Yeah.
Wouldn't you know it?
All right, we tried to do it the right way, now we're gonna wake this town up ourselves.
- Yeah, yeah, but how?
- Yeah, how?
Any way we can think of.
We've got to stop being a baby-sitting service and start being a police department.
- Just kids, Jim.
- Just kids?
That's about he craziest argument 
I've ever heard.
Every criminal in the world was a kid once. 
What does it prove?
You know what I think?
I think they've got it in for me.
- You?
- Yeah.
They've heard about my war record, and it bugs them.
They're trying to break me down, see what makes me tick.
Anything they can try, they try.
Aw, I don't think so, Jim.
- What the...
- Sounds like New Year's Eve.
Hello?
I don't know either...
Lady?
Police department.
Looks like everybody in town's getting up.
What's going on here?
Why, that's an air raid!
Pull yourself together.
Oh, it's probably only...
No, maybe it's the real thing.
It isn't a drill.
Where is my civil defense helmet?
Where is it?
Here we are.
Here we go.
- Fire.
- Fire?
This has never happened before.
What am I gonna wear?
Henry, Danny's gone!
What?
And Jane too!
- Calm down, Elizabeth.
- I looked in their rooms. They're both gone!
- Are you sure?
- Yes! Yes!
Well, maybe they're down here.
Here's Danny.
Danny!
What are you doing here?
I'm guarding you.
Guarding us?
Guarding us against what, darling?
I don't know.
Has everyone in this fool town gone crazy?
Danny, do you know where Janey is?
She's just gone.
I'm going to get to the bottom of this right now.
Come, Elizabeth.
Hey, what's going on here?
What's the matter?
All right now, kill the ho...
Kill the horns!
All right, knock off the noise now!
Listen to... Listen to me!
Now listen to me, everybody!
This town is in danger.
Several people have been killed already.
Now we had to make this noise so you'd listen to us, so we could warn you.
If we're in trouble, where are the police?
You! Boy, this time you've really hung yourself.
Now look... Now look, sarge, just give me a chance to talk to them, that's all.
I don't know what kind of a game it is you're playing, but whatever it is it's gonna stop right now!
Here comes Dave.
What's going on here, Jim? 
Steve!
Dave, make 'em listen to me!
There is a monster!
We saw it again in Dad's store.
Dave, it's bigger now.
Your story's gotten bigger now, kid.
Dave, look at me! Do I look like somebody who's playing a practical joke?
Am I laughing... or am I scared stiff?
- What are you gonna do?
- He's telling the truth.
Oh, wait a minute! It's one thing to make a fool out of yourself, but it's another thing to make a fool out of the police department and the town.
- He's right, Lieutenant.
- You've been wrong before.
Maybe I have! But as long as I'm in charge of this town's police force,
I'm gonna handle this thing the way I see fit.
And your job right now is to help me restore some order around here.
Yes, sir.
Okay, everybody, quiet down a minute.
Quiet down, please!
Listen, this is an emergency, and it can affect every one of us.
That's all I can tell you right now.
But we're trying to get things under control.
In order to do that, we have to clear this area immediately.
So please go home and stay there.
We'll keep in touch with you through your radio station.
Now, be careful pulling your cars out of this area.
Go home slowly and quietly.
Just keep calm.
Everything's gonna be all right.
- Anything I can do to help?
- Lieutenant, what's going on?
Ask your daughter, Mr. Martin.
She can tell you more than I can.
Phil, can your boys give us a hand clearing this area? 
Sure.
- Do you have any guns?
- A couple of 'em.
- Get 'em.
- Say, Dave, what is this thing?
I don't know. But if it's in the market, we'll all know in a few minutes.
Now all the images of horror,
the demons of your mind crowd in on you to destroy you.
Phil, can you move your truck over to the door... and shine your big light into the market?
- Sure, Dave.
- All right.
What the...
Hey, who's in the store?
Huh?
There's nobody in here but us monsters.
Dave, it's at the theater!
Don't go in, Jim.
This won't do any good.
It's the most horrible thing
I've ever seen in my life.
- So what is it?
- Come on, we've gotta clear this area.
All right, step back!
Everybody step back!
Here it comes!
Danny!
No, Danny, wait!
What goes?
What happened out there?
Oh, I almost got it.
No, Danny! Danny, we can't stay here.
Come with me, Danny.
Listen, it's too late.
Let's see if we can get out the back.
Wait a minute!
What's this?
- What happened?
- It's all over us.
- What do you mean? What's the matter?
- Take it easy!
Jim, get the telephone company. 
Have them connect you with the diner, fast.
I'm not gonna stay here!
Now, wait a minute!
You open that door, and we've had it!
- You wanna die?
- What are we supposed to do?
- Hello? Yeah.
- Steve?
- That thing is all over us!
- Watch out!
I don't think it can be killed.
- We've gotta try one more thing.
- Okay.
- Is everybody all right?
- Okay, but not for long.
We can drop a power line on it.
Do you understand?
There should be enough juice in that line to burn the thing to a crisp.
Yeah, get everyone down in the cellar.
We'll do it in 60 seconds, Steve.
Cellar!
Okay.
Jim, here's a rifle.
- Take the phone, Ritchie.
- All right.
Dave, this baby should do the trick.
It's all set to go.
Try not to miss, Jim.
Okay, let's have those lights!
Fifteen seconds.
It's quiet now.
I think the upstairs is clear.
Good. Keep your ear to that phone, Ritchie.
Okay, Jim.
It didn't work.
Why don't you do something?
Do something!
Elizabeth.
The diner's on fire.
Can't we put it out?
Any suggestions how?
Anyway, not enough oxygen in there to keep a fire going for ten minutes.
There's something burning.
- Listen, is there any other way out of here?
- The windows.
Hey, now you be quiet.
Shhh.
- I'm not afraid.
- Well, I know you're not.
Hey, listen, Jane...
It'll be all right.
Honey, lay your head down and try to go to sleep.
Everything will be all right, Danny.
Hey, there's the fire!
I'll stop it!
Wait a minute.
Let me have that a minute.
CO2! Hey, that's it!
It's cold!
That's why it didn't come in the ice box after us. 
It can't stand cold.
- You got any more of these things? Huh?
- No.
This thing's running out.
The phone. Hey, Dave!
Hey, Dave! Hey, Da...
Anybody on the phone?
Hey, Dave!
Dave, can you hear me?
CO2!
Dave!
- What did he say?
- Al, what's up?
Shhh. Quiet.
CO2?
Phil! Phil, do you got any CO2 extinguishers?
Not many.
Some soda acid.
Well, get the CO2s out here and start hitting around those cellar windows.
- What?
- Just do it, Phil!
And check these buildings for fire extinguishers. 
But only the CO2 kind.
- Bring back every one you can get your hands on.
- All right. Okay.
Hey, maybe we can help.
Let's get some guys together.
- Lieutenant, I know where there are 20 extinguishers
- Good. Where?
- At the high school. Who can go with me?
- Hey, right here, Mr. Martin.
Well, what are we waiting for? 
Let's go.
Okay, let's go.
Over here, Mr. Martin.
This thing's running out!
Hey, Dave! Dave?
Dave, CO2 fire extinguishers!
Dave, can you hear me?
CO2!
Okay, come on.
- Oh, it's locked.
- Of course it's locked.
- Here comes Mr. Martin.
- Here comes the principal.
We could only find four or five of these things, Dave.
- How many of them do you need?
- A lot more than that.
- Keep looking. It's all we can do.
- Okay.
Dave, Colonel Spaulding got me through to Washington.
They thought I was crazy at first, but they're getting someone now.
Hey, here come the kids!
Our power's still out, so we can't do much in the way of refrigeration.
We think we've got it under control, but we won't rest easy until it's frozen solid.
Now...
No, it's too big for that, and it's impossible to cut it.
No, sir, a bomb would spread it all over the country.
Look, this thing has killed probably 40 or 50 people since last night.
In a few hours, we're gonna have the sun overhead.
I think you should send us the biggest transport plane you have... and take this thing up to the Arctic or somewhere where it'll never thaw out.
Oh, Daddy! Oh, Daddy!
Let me see you, son.
Let me see my boy.
- Nice work, Steve. You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.
Dave, listen, I wanna...
Well, I wanna thank you for getting us out of there.
You know, for a while,
I didn't think we were gonna make it.
- That makes two of us.
- What are they gonna do with that thing, Dave?
Well, the Air Force is sending a Globemaster in.
They're flying it to the Arctic.
It's not dead, is it?
No, it's not.
- Just frozen.
- I don't think it can be killed.
But at least we've got it stopped.
Yeah, as long as the Arctic stays cold.
I am William Castle, the director of the motion picture you're about to see.
I feel obligated to warn you... that some of the sensations, some of the physical reactions... which the actors on the screen will feel... will also be experienced for the first time in motion picture history... by certain members of this audience.
I say "certain members" because some people are more sensitive... to these mysterious electronic impulses than others.
These unfortunate, sensitive people... will at times feel a strange, tingling sensation.
Others will feel it less strongly.
But don't be alarmed.
You could protect yourself.
At any time you are conscious of a tingling sensation... you may obtain immediate relief by screaming.
Don't be embarrassed about opening your mouth and letting rip with all you got.
Because the person in the seat right next to you... will probably be screaming too.
And remember this:
A scream at the right time may save your life.
- Who are you?
- I'm nobody.
- Unless you got business...
- I won't bother you.
You got to have a pass to come in here.
Will this do?
I'm sorry.
I didn't know it was a relative.
- It's my wife's brother.
- Try not to faint.
I won't faint.
- I understand going to friend's funeral.
- We weren't "friends," exactly.
I had a pass to the execution, and I mean...
- Does it always kill them in the chair?
- I've never heard of it failing.
Well, in the chair, does it hurt them?
Not if it's done properly.
At least, I don't think so.
Even a slight shock hurts.
Try putting an electrode soaked in saline solution on your head... another strapped to your leg, then slamming 2,000 volts between them.
If it hurts, let me know.
Well, if it works, then why this?
I've never found it to be necessary.
But it happens to be the law.
An autopsy must be performed immediately after the execution.
Interesting.
This man's vertebrae are cracked.
They're nearly splintered in two.
Two thousand volts!
Electricity had nothing to do with this.
I've seen this phenomenon many times in people who were badly frightened... just before they died.
There's a force in us that science knows nothing about. The force of fear.
That it's strong enough to shatter the spinal column, we know.
But what it is... what causes it to appear and disappear, we don't know.
Some day I hope to find out.
Maybe it's what makes your spine tingle when you're scared.
Exactly.
Tingle?
It can do a great deal more than that.
It's odd. I've been experimenting with this force for years.
Never had a name for it until now.
Now I think I'll call it "The Tingler."
- You do all the autopsies out here?
- Most of them, and for the county too.
It ties in with my experimental work in fear.
Many people die in fear.
I wonder how many die of fear.
You mean, being scared to death?
Not on the death certificate.
Fear causes tremendous tensions in the body.
If you can't relieve them, why can't they become strong enough to kill you?
Never thought of it that way.
I've thought of little else for some years now.
That man's vertebrae are cracked.
Sensation of fear alone can't have done that.
Something real and powerful broke those bones.
And on the death certificate...
I'll write down that death was caused by heart failure... due to electrically induced shock.
I guess he deserved it, killing those two women in cold blood like that.
What?
He killed two women. Right down the street from where I live.
Looked for a while, though. They couldn't find a clue, but they did.
I seldom know who they are or what they did.
I suppose because I don't want to know.
Science is sometimes frighteningly impersonal.
Being my wife's brother...
Well, you ready?
You wouldn't be able to give me a ride into town, Doc?
I'm sure I'd be glad to, Mr...?
My name's Oliver Higgins.
Everybody calls me just Ollie.
Where do you live?
There aren't many theaters like this left.
You'd be surprised how many come to see these old pictures.
- Not just to make fun, either.
- Yours?
It belongs to my wife.
We run it together, though.
- Would you like a beer or coffee, Doc?
- Coffee'd be fine.
Good, I live right up there.
I'll check with the wife first.
I'm going upstairs and make some coffee.
I'll open up later.
Well, shall we go, Doc?
It's kind of old-fashioned, but she likes it this way.
- You like cream and sugar?
- No. Black, please.
Just the two of you run the whole show?
You'd be surprised how much work it takes.
Just the cleaning up alone.
Mopping, sweeping, vacuuming the seats and the runners.
Once a week, we go over everything.
We even do the ceiling.
We even do behind the screens and under the seats.
- I tell you, it takes a lot of work.
- It sounds like it.
You know, you ought to come sometime, Doc.
Some of the silents are just as good as the movies they make nowadays.
Even with the sound and the color, and the screens a block wide.
I'd like to see some of the old
Charlie Chaplin films again.
We show them once a year.
I'll let you know.
That's my wife.
Never mind. She'll come in here.
She has to wash her hands first.
Martha?
This is Doctor Warren Chapin.
She says she just finished washing her hands.
She's deaf and dumb. She can read lips if you talk straight to her.
How do you do, Mrs. Higgins?
She says to excuse her, but she never shakes hands.
People's hands have germs, she says.
Tell her she's so right.
She can't make a sound or hear a sound.
- No vocal cords?
- None.
She's a bug in this washing up.
Our bill for towels is five bucks a week.
There you are, Doc.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
That was a clumsy thing to do.
- It's my fault.
- No, it's nothing but a small cut.
Go down and get the bag out of my car.
She always does this.
One drop of blood and out she goes.
It affects some people like that.
Did you notice how rigid she became?
She always does.
It's interesting.
Because she has no vocal cords, she can't release fear vocally.
So they continue to mount, until she can't endure it.
So she faints?
It isn't a faint as we know it.
It's more of a psychosomatic escape.
I never thought of that.
You go downstairs and open up.
I'll come downstairs in a minute.
It's time to open up the box office.
We'd better go down first. She won't leave anybody alone with that safe.
Thanks for asking me up, Ollie.
I'm sorry I caused you all that trouble.
That's all right, no harm done.
Thanks for the ride home.
I'm sorry about...
Goodbye, Mrs. Higgins. I'm sorry
I caused all that trouble.
She says goodbye, and she hopes your cut isn't serious.
No. No, it isn't.
Goodbye. Bye, Mrs. Higgins.
Goodbye, Doc.
Good luck with your experiment.
Thanks.
Hi, Lucy. Where's my devoted wife?
Where's David?
Tell me something, Warren.
What happened to those rules I learned about what every young girl should do?
Like, keep your date waiting for at least ten minutes.
And never let him know that she wonders if he's ever going to show at all.
It's all my fault.
I sometimes... like right now, wish he didn't work for you at all.
- That he was...
- A what? A Persian rug merchant?
That's much worse.
Just an ordinary eight-to-fiver with a yen for picket fences.
And waste one of the best minds in pathology?
Not really.
I love David just the way he is.
I don't even want to change him.
Golly, is that abnormal?
Refreshing.
Isabel went out about an hour ago.
What are we going to do about her?
- She's simply ruining her life.
- It's not her fault.
A husband who spends all his time in the laboratory.
And hates cocktails and parties, and falls asleep at the opera.
She's out almost every night now.
And with men who aren't very nice.
I'm ashamed of my sister.
Lucy, as soon as David and I finish this experiment...
I'll have more time for her.
He'll have more for you.
I'd wait for Dave forever if I have to.
But why do I have to, Warren?
Does being someone's guardian give you the right to rule them?
You've had another battle with Isabel?
No. The same one.
I'm too young. David's too poor.
If I do anything she doesn't approve of... she won't give me my share of the money.
I'll talk to her.
What good will that do?
Who knows?
- Have you had any dinner?
- Not yet.
- I'll fix you something.
- No, look. I'm not really hungry.
Warren, you've got to eat.
Cut my head off.
Boil me in oil.
Young man?
What do you mean, keeping this beautiful girl waiting?
You say, "Go get a cat."
You ever chase a cat down an alley?
I'm lucky to be alive.
Did you get one?
A big black brute.
Trouble is, I don't think we can scare him.
Well, what are you two up to now?
Black cats in dark alleys?
Fear has the same effect on all animals.
You mean I'm an animal?
Better-looking than most, and can't run as fast.
I hope.
- I got that prescription for you.
- Good.
From the articles I read, it's a very interesting drug.
So is nitroglycerin.
Where is that all-for-science attitude?
I left it in my other suit.
Don't fool with that stuff alone.
It can produce pretty weird effects.
Speaking of which, I saw an interesting reaction this afternoon.
There's this deaf-mute. She can't utter a sound, and she has a blood trauma.
I cut my hand on a broken saucer, and she went into total shock.
I've never seen anyone so terrified... or so unable to release her fear tensions.
What happened?
Her husband thinks she faints, but it isn't a true faint at all.
It's much more serious.
Her unreleased tensions grow so great... that she goes into psychosomatic blackout.
What if she didn't?
That's an interesting question.
If we get her to a fluoroscope, and show her some blood...
Please!
We're going to dinner!
I'm sorry.
All right, you kids get out of here.
We'll go, if you stay out of the lab tonight.
The further we go, the surer I am that what we're looking for... is something tangible. Real.
Anything that can exert such tremendous pressure on the spinal column... must be something you can see, touch, hold in your hand.
It may exist for only a fraction of a second, but... there's something in every frightened person that's as solid as steel.
And probably stronger.
I think I've found a name for it.
The Tingler. You like it?
The Tingler? Why not?
Since we don't know what it is yet, we can't give it a Latin name.
Tingler.
It must cover almost the entire backbone.
The only way we'll ever isolate it is to catch someone... at the instant of complete terror.
Not before, not after.
David.
You'll be too weak.
- Weak?
- From starvation.
Have fun. And David...
I know. I know.
Don't keep him out late. He has a hard day in the lab tomorrow.
- Good night, Warren.
- Good night.
Good evening.
I wish you wouldn't stand around in the dark.
Feet hurt?
As a matter of fact, they do.
Not from running.
That was a charming little scene out there.
Wasn't it?
- Good night.
- Love in bloom, right on the sidewalk.
Rather shopworn, though, isn't it?
Don't tell me you've abandoned corpses for peeping out of windows.
If there was anything honest about your behavior, I might feel differently.
You're just playing the field, and vice versa.
You know, I think I'll have a nightcap with amateur psychiatry.
Jealousy doesn't look well on your tie, dear.
There's no jealousy involved.
You know, Warren, you've lost contact with living people.
Nobody means anything to you anymore, unless they're dead.
And you can root around in them with your sharp little knives.
There's a word for you.
There's several for you.
Lucy's very upset. So is Dave.
And for that matter, so am I.
Good.
The only way Dave Morris will marry my sister is over my dead body.
Unconventional, but not impossible.
They're nice kids. They're in love.
They're old enough and wise enough to make a go of a marriage.
Nice kids! Love!
Morris is another you. A scientist... who thinks the world is in his lab.
I won't let my sister sacrifice herself the way I did.
You may have to.
What do you mean?
You suggested a way.
I'm tired and I'm sleepy.
- Good night.
- Stay awake a little longer.
The next time you sleep, it may be forever.
- Is this the hour for melodrama?
- Depends on your definition.
Sit down. Let's have a chat.
- You've nothing to say I want to hear.
- Sit down anyway!
Go on!
Now you won't have so far to go.
I'd like to make two suggestions.
First, leave Lucy and Dave alone.
You're a shrewd and evil woman, adept at twisting people's minds.
Leave them alone. Please.
Next, I suggest that you give
Lucy half of the money you've got.
So Dave can continue in pathology, without the obstacle of having no money.
I know a wonderful psychiatrist with a divine straitjacket... just your size.
Are you forgetting anything?
- Probably.
- That's the understatement of the year.
Now remember this:
Everything you've got, I paid for!
Your lab, all that expensive junk,
Morris' wages, your car, this house!
And remember!
All I have to do to put you and Morris into the street is to turn the key.
On the goodie box?
Where did the goodies come from?
My father.
Nice man too. Pity he died so suddenly.
I had nothing to do with my father's death, and you know it.
- Like me to prove it isn't nonsense?
- You can't prove anything.
- There's nothing to prove.
- You wouldn't like me to try?
And you should remember this, darling.
Organic poisons, like old soldiers, never die.
They just lie smoldering in the grave.
And I'm not bad at autopsies.
You're crazy! You really are.
Isn't everyone? Now walk straight ahead.
Go on.
What are you going to do?
We'll have a little chat. What I do next is entirely up to you, so walk.
Where are you taking me?
It'll be easier to "rearrange" things in the laboratory.
You should come in here more often, dear.
Let's stop all this childish behavior.
- A gun is so out of character.
- Isn't it? Over there.
- Warren, stop it!
- Over there!
Have you gone completely out of your mind?
Not at all.
You see, you're a good teacher.
You taught me how to get what I want, no matter who gets hurt.
- What do you mean by that?
- Just this:
Ever since you've been Lucy's guardian, you've tried to ruin her life.
You've greedily kept what was hers.
Now I'm giving you a choice.
Either you give Lucy half of all the money you got and leave her alone... or you commit suicide right now.
Suicide? You mean murder.
When I finish rearranging things, it'll look like suicide.
Now make up your mind.
We want to be through with this before Lucy comes home.
I won't give that child anything, so put away that silly pistol!
This "silly" pistol can make a hole in you... the size of a medium grapefruit.
I'll call the police!
You're not hurt, dear.
It was just a blank cartridge.
Thanks for helping with the experiment.
You played your part excellently.
I see.
Sharing in your husband's work and all that, you know.
Kitty.
Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.
I was going to use this cat.
But you made a much better subject.
Have you two met?
In the same alley, perhaps?
When my turn comes, and it will come... it won't be an experiment.
Howdy, boss!
I've got something to show you.
Wait. I brought a dog.
A dog? What for?
You say, "Get a cat." I got it,
You say, "Get a dog." I get a dog.
We don't need him.
"A" for effort.
I wouldn't be surprised if in a fair fight that cat'd whip this dog.
- What do you want to show me?
- You've never seen anything like this.
See anything unusual?
What's this?
You tell me.
I don't know. But it's stronger and denser than bone.
I'm showing you these negatives in reverse order... on purpose.
Look at that!
Wait.
The Tingler.
It must be.
Until we get a specimen of it, we can't be sure.
I can't see any bone structure.
- It must be solid matter.
- That's what I thought.
How'd you get this picture? Who is it?
- It doesn't matter how or who.
- Isabel?
I said it doesn't matter.
- I'm sorry, Warren.
- That's all right.
Let's review our progress so far.
What do we know about The Tingler?
What do we think we know, and what've we got to find out?
First, we know that it exists.
If roentgen rays can't penetrate it, we know it's solid.
We know that fear energizes it, gives it strength.
That's about all we know.
Except that it exists in every human being.
And that it's extremely powerful.
What do we think we know?
That fear causes The Tingler to spread along the spinal column.
And with those arm-like things, between the vertebrae... forces it to become arched and rigid.
And you believe that screaming... or any sound the human in fear can make, paralyzes it?
At least screaming seems to stop it from bending the spinal column.
Screaming may dissolve it, or if it's a living organism, kill it.
And these are things we have to find out.
- What do you think it's made of?
- I don't know.
But I'd guess sinews of some very powerful material.
You said, "living organism."
Could The Tingler be alive?
A separate and living thing inside our bodies?
Why not?
You know, of course, that after death... many things continue to live in the body.
Fingernails grow.
So does hair, and the formation of calcium in the bones continues.
Life is not merely a matter of breathing and a beating heart.
- We've come a long way.
- We got a long way to go.
Perhaps. And perhaps not.
We now know that at the peak of terror...
The Tingler is a solid mass extending from the coccyx to the cervicals.
If one could stand the pain without screaming... or otherwise releasing their tension until they died... an autopsy would give us a Tingler we could work with.
The advancement of human knowledge is fine, but dying for it...
If that's your attitude... we'll have to find someone else who's willing to die for science.
And eventually we will.
I'm worried, David. Isabel has been sweet to me all day.
Me too. At least she said good morning.
Even smiled.
So look out. The roof is going to fall in.
- Coffee, Warren?
- No, thanks.
I've been thinking...
Yes, I'd love a cup of coffee.
Thank you.
So?
I've been trying to frighten myself, but nothing works.
It isn't that I'm too intelligent.
Just too grown up.
Kids can scare themselves... by lying in the dark and making ghosts out of chairs, but we can't.
The only way I can frighten myself is to make it real.
Jump out of a window, get run over by a car, go out and drown.
After those x-rays, we know The Tingler exists.
Why do you have to scare yourself?
I want to personally sense the power of The Tingler... in a genuine fear situation.
In a controlled experiment, with my own fear... perhaps I can find out all the things we have to know.
Only nothing scares me.
Exactly. Boo!
Well, back to the salt mines.
Why don't you take the night off?
Go to a movie. You and Lucy.
I'll be in later.
I mean it. Take the night off.
Okay, boss. The night off.
Good night.
This is not good.
- He's leaving us out of something.
- But what? There's nothing in the lab.
That drug you brought...
It's not a drug. It's an acid.
I wonder...
Locked.
He never did that before.
Can you see anything?
He's locking the other door.
What's he doing now?
He's saying something to the tape recorder.
Average injection: 50 micromilligrams.
Fifty.
I'm making it 100 micromilligrams in solution.
What's happening now?
Warren wanted to do this.
Let's hope he's accomplishing something important.
What's he doing now?
Time: 8:03. Sharp stinging sensation.
Now he's sitting down.
- Is he all right?
- As far as I can tell.
Definite blurring of vision now... at 8:11.
Emotionally, I feel nothing abnormal.
What does that stuff do to you?
For one thing, nightmares.
You're wide-awake.
But you're having nightmares.
Blurring of vision... has been replaced by distinct rocking... and tilting sensation.
I don't seem to be tilting, but the room is... from side to side.
Time...
Emotionally, I begin to feel somewhat apprehensive.
Probably normal, however.
The room is closing in on me.
He's talking again.
I wish I could hear.
Is he all right?
Something is scaring him.
The room is closing in on me.
You've got to make it stop.
The walls!
The walls!
Can't we help him?
No, we can't, Lucy.
Break the door. He may be suffering.
That drug may be hurting him.
He's only suffering in his mind.
Nothing is hurting him.
It may hurt his mind.
There's nothing we can do to help him now.
That acid must wear off naturally.
If I try to stop it or even minimize it with an antidote, I might kill him.
I got to get out of here!
No breath!
No air!
I can't breathe!
The window. It won't open!
It's locked. Barred!
Somebody's got to help me!
- Isn't there another key?
- Maybe. I'll go look.
Mustn't scream.
I mustn't scream!
I broke down and screamed, didn't I?
I couldn't help it, Dave.
Things were pretty foggy... but I remember thinking that I mustn't scream.
But the pain and the fear were so great.
I don't think anybody could keep from screaming if they were really terrified.
Unless...
Unless what?
Just an idle idea.
I'd better be on my way. Good night, kids.
Unless what, Dave?
Suppose a person could not possibly scream?
Well, everybody can scream.
A deaf-mute can't scream.
- Evening, Doc.
- Ollie.
Come to see the show?
Not tonight. I just dropped by to see how you were doing.
Well, pretty good.
- How's your experiment?
- It's making progress.
In fact, I dropped by because I was worried about your wife.
A shock like that can have pretty bad after-effects.
I've been a little worried about her too.
She hasn't eaten a thing and she can't sleep.
Ever since she saw that blood, she just roams around the theater all night.
Is she here now?
She's upstairs. She won't even tend the box office anymore.
Why don't I have a look at her?
It may be a simple case of nerves.
- I'd appreciate it.
- What drugstore do you use?
The Cut-Rate around the corner.
Good evening, Mrs. Higgins.
Ollie told me to come up.
He said you weren't...
Ollie told me to come up and see you.
He said you weren't feeling well.
Would you like me to check you over?
All you need is sleep and rest.
Now I'm going to give you a shot.
To relax you.
And then I'm going to give Ollie a prescription for some barbiturates.
Sleeping pills. They won't hurt you.
All right?
All you need is rest and sleep.
How much? How about a couple of passes for your theater?
Now you just go to sleep, and you'll be as fit as a fiddle.
Lie down.
Good night.
How is she, Doc?
It's just nerves.
I gave her a shot to relax her.
If she should wake up, give her these pills.
- How long will she sleep?
- Now?
The shot should wear off in two or three hours.
Have her take these pills.
She needs a lot of sleep.
I'll go get this filled.
I have time to have a beer, don't I?
Sure.
Join me? With her sick,
I certainly need one.
I'd like to very much.
But I have some work to finish.
Thanks, Doc. And good night.
Home so soon?
Did you hear what the husband said to the wife?
This another one of your oblique jokes?
Why does the back door slam every time I come in the front door?
Because he was a jealous husband?
Nothing like a good two-fisted drinker, right?
Are you sure I didn't mix them for you, dear?
You look tired.
It's a pity I'm not the type for gold tie clips.
But you are, Warren. Exactly.
Doc! Doc, my wife!
I know it's late, but my wife...
Take it easy. What's the trouble?
She's sick. Maybe dead by now.
It's terrible.
I'll get my bag.
I brought her here because you treated her.
I tried to phone you.
Let's bring her around to the lab door.
Just a couple of beers.
When I got home, there she was.
You suppose...
Could it be that shot you gave her?
Well, hardly.
I found her lying on the bathroom floor.
She was so cold, I thought she was dead.
When I picked her up, she moved.
Ollie, your wife is dead.
I'm very sorry.
I guess I wasn't much of a husband to her.
There's no way I can make up for it.
Ollie, I'm really sorry.
Do you feel like helping me with some details?
I feel okay.
What do you want to know?
Tell me as closely as you can... what time you found her, and the circumstances.
It must have been about one o'clock, Doc.
When you left, I went to have a beer.
When I came home, I just went in.
There she was, lying on the bathroom floor.
- Age?
- She's 46.
Was there any sign of a struggle?
There was nothing. She was just lying on the bathroom floor.
There wasn't anything unusual about the room at all?
No. Just the way it always is.
From her expression, something must have terrified her just before she died.
You haven't any idea what it was?
Everything was locked.
There was no sign of anyone there.
My God, she's alive!
She's not alive, Ollie.
Something frightened her to death.
She's been dead for over an hour.
She moved.
May I find out why?
Sure, Doc, sure. Anything you want.
Just sit over there.
The Tingler!
Give me that glass tank.
- What happened?
- It attacked him.
That thing?
How strong is it, Doc?
Strong enough to kill a man, easily and quickly.
- What made it let go?
- My screaming, I think.
Must have been.
Your wife is...
She's dead.
Are you badly hurt, Warren?
Good night. I'm sorry about your wife.
Is there anything I can do for your arm, dear?
No, thank you.
Thank you, Ollie.
We'd better call a funeral parlor.
No, not in the middle of the night.
Couldn't I just take her home and call in the morning?
It's easier that way. They'll just come...
It might take quite a long while.
It's so late.
You'd have to wait up.
- I'd rather take her myself.
- All right.
- Can you manage?
- I can manage.
You'd better notify the police right away.
I will.
Has he gone?
This is very important to you, isn't it, Warren?
Yes, very.
You've worked so long to find it.
Let's celebrate, shall we?
Let's celebrate finding The Tingler.
And me.
You?
I've been a bad and foolish wife.
All this time I've been jealous of your work.
How silly can you get?
- Scotch?
- Yes, I think so.
Thanks.
Here you are.
I'd rather have the other glass, darling.
Why?
More booze.
They're both exactly the same.
You're so amusing.
And so trusting.
Thanks.
Here's to The Tingler... and your new wife.
I hope the new wife doesn't turn out to be as dangerous as The Tingler.
One thing that's so nice about you...
I can always count on you.
To do what?
The right thing.
Now, about this new wife...
First, about The Tingler.
Is it really so dangerous?
You know...
I felt as though my arm were in one of those hydraulic presses.
Tremendous power.
What are you going to do with it?
Probably for my old wife.
That you, Doc?
I just called to let you know everything's all right.
You really didn't have to bother.
I left her...
Well, I mean...
She's at the funeral parlor.
I called the police.
They said let it go till morning.
Nothing affects it.
You can't destroy the thing.
Doctors will be amazed when they see The Tingler.
They're not going to see it.
Aren't you taking it to the convention?
You'll write about it in the journals.
There's not going to be anything in the journals about it.
After all this work!
What are you going to do?
To break the laws of nature is always dangerous... and we've violated some basic principles.
We had to. But now we'll stop.
But, Warren, you can't just...
Hear me out.
That The Tingler exists in every human being we now know.
Look at that.
It's an ugly and dangerous thing.
Ugly because it's the creation of man's fear.
Dangerous because a frightened man is dangerous.
We can't destroy it, because we've removed it from its natural place.
Then what can we do?
Call Ollie.
Ask him the name of the funeral parlor where he left his wife.
We can only hope, and try.
Fear made that Tingler grow from microscopic size to this.
We can only hope... when it goes back where it came from, it'll also go back to a thing... infinitely small. Even die.
Because its creator is dead.
All fear gone.
Ollie doesn't answer.
Then call the police or the coroner.
They'll know.
- Isabel's gone.
- Isabel is always gone.
- I mean she's left.
- Give me the police department.
- She's taken her clothes.
- I want to check on a death.
Well, I can only hope she'll be happier.
They have no report of her death.
But they must have! Ollie called me...
I wonder.
Call Ollie again.
Call him till he answers.
And when he does, tell him not to do anything foolish.
That I'll try to help him.
- What did you do with her?
- I took her to the funeral home.
Like I told you on the phone, but you hung up on me.
- Where is she?
- I keep telling you, Doc.
What's in there?
Just my things. I'm moving out.
It's too gloomy here.
You killed her.
No, I didn't.
Your wife was frightened to death with this.
And this.
What did you do with her?
- I keep telling...
- You're lying!
You don't know how it was with her.
She would've killed me if she could've.
She tried to lots of times.
You don't know how it was.
I know exactly how it was.
What are you going to do?
First, I'm going to put The Tingler back where it came from.
So that if it can die, it will.
And then I'll call the police.
It broke out of the box!
What's that?
It's just a loose board.
I've been meaning to fix it.
What's below this?
The theater!
The theater!
The Tingler is in the theater!
I'll warn the audience.
No, you'd start a panic.
We've got to be quiet and careful.
But we've got to find it.
It must be in here somewhere.
Let's look down the other aisle.
Ladies and gentlemen, there's no cause for alarm.
A young lady has fainted.
She is being attended to by a doctor, and is quite all right.
So please remain seated.
The movie will begin again right away.
I repeat, there is no cause for alarm.
- Must have been about here.
- No, it's further down.
Why can't we see it?
Ladies and gentlemen, please do not panic!
But scream! Scream for your lives!
The Tingler is loose in this theater!
And if you don't scream, it may kill you!
Scream!
Scream!
Keep screaming! Scream for your life!
It's here! It's over here!
Help! Help!
- Look out, it's under the stage!
- Ladies and gentlemen.
The Tingler has been paralyzed by your screaming.
There is no more danger.
We will now resume the showing of the movie.
The projection booth, quick!
Are you all right?
- Where is it?
- Right there.
- You must have screamed just in time.
- I guess so.
All right, no more stalling.
Don't open that film can until I tell you.
And then you'll have to help me.
I'm sorry now I did what I did, Doc.
You gave me the idea.
Just because poison happens to exist is no excuse to commit murder with it.
I'm not blaming you.
But I knew she couldn't scream, and about The Tingler and all.
Give me The Tingler now.
Come on. Give it to me.
It isn't as though I'd shot her or taken a knife and stabbed her, is it?
If you kill anybody deliberately, it's murder.
No matter how you do it.
I guess they'll probably electrocute me, won't they?
I'm neither judge nor jury.
This time you're going to the police with me.
You're wrong. You're going by yourself.
Look, all I have to do is go downstairs and call the police.
It won't do you any good.
Goodbye.
Ladies and gentlemen, just a word of warning.
If any of you are not convinced that you have a Tingler of your own...
the next time you're frightened in the dark, don't scream.
It has been written... since the beginning of time... even onto these ancient stones... that evil, supernatural creatures exist... in a world of darkness.
And it is also said... man, using the magic power... of the ancient runic symbols... can call forth these powers of darkness... the demons of hell.
- I must see Dr. Karswell at once.
- Who shall I say is calling?
Professor Harrington.
Tell him it's most urgent.
I'm afraid Mr. Karswell is not at home, sir.
I know he's here. Tell him
I won't leave until he does see me.
- I'm very sorry, sir.
- Well, go back and say--
- Karswell.
- That's all right, Bates.
Please, come in.
This way.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
Mother--
Well, I'll go and see about some tea.
That won't be necessary.
We shall only be a minute.
Call it off, Karswell.
Stop this thing you've started... and I'll admit publicly I was totally wrong and that you were totally right.
It's very gratifying to hear that, but some things... are more easily started than stopped.
But I've heard it.
I've seen it. I know it's real!
You involved me in a public scandal.
I protested.
You said, ''Do your worst,'' and that's precisely what I did.
Please, Karswell.
I'll stop this investigation.
When Holden arrives,
I'll tell him I've made a mistake.
I'll send a statement to the newspapers.
No more newspapers. All I ask for is privacy for myself and my followers.
- Well, I promise.
- All right. That's good enough.
Then you'll stop this?
You've still got that parchment
I gave you?
The runic symbols?
No, they burned. I couldn't stop it.
I see. Well, I think perhaps you'd better go home.
- Then you will help me?
- I'll do all that I can.
- Karswell, if you only knew.
- I do know.
Thank you.
- Good night, Mrs. Karswell.
- Good night.
Thank you again.
Good-bye, Professor.
Excuse me.
I can't get out.
- Sorry.
- Good.
Here they come.
Dr. Holden?
I'm Lloyd Williamson.
- Professor Harrington's personal aide.
- How are you?
I'm so glad I'd be able to meet you here, sir.
The professor had planned to meet you here himself, but he--
- Well--
- Dr. Holden?
We're the press, sir.
Could you spare a few minutes?
- What makes me news?
- Ghosts.
What exactly is the function of this convention you're attending?
Investigation of international reports on paranormal psychology.
''Para'' what psychology?
Just say mind-reading, fortune-telling, spirits and zombies.
Operator, I'm still waiting for my number.
I'm sorry. The number you requested is reported out of order.
Could you check it, then?
It's to Professor Harrington's house.
That is the correct number, but
I'm sorry. The line is out of order.
Oh. Thank you.
Sorry to keep you waiting,
Williamson.
You were saying
Professor Harrington couldn't come.
I'm afraid I have some terrible news for you.
Professor Harrington was found dead this morning.
Found dead?
Sorry to disturb you, but there's so much to do and so little time.
I'll be right out.
The police say that
Professor Harrington was electrocuted.
Somehow, his car ran into a power line outside his house.
It was a terrible accident.
He must've died instantly.
- The services will be held tomorrow.
- I'll be there.
This is Mark O'Brien. He's been working with Professor Harrington.
- He'll continue to do so with you.
- Fine.
You'll have to forgive me.
I had a little sleep to catch up on.
- Of course.
- Sit down. I won't be very long.
- What is this?
- Part of O'Brien's research... which is tied up with the Karswell Devil Cult investigation.
I see.
Let me get some clothes on.
I wrote Professor Harrington recently that if he wanted to find the key... to Karswell's phony supernatural power, all he had to do... was check the psychological makeup of some of his followers.
I know, but we ran into difficulty.
The one cult member we persuaded to speak up-- a farmer named Rand Hobart-- was arrested several weeks ago as an alleged murderer.
He can still be useful.
I'm afraid not.
His mind is in total collapse.
He's in a state of catatonic shock and in a home for the criminally insane.
Why do you say ''alleged murderer''?
That's just my personal view.
A short while ago at the asylum,
I succeeded in rousing Hobart.
Under hypnosis, he produced this drawing.
It's crude, but remarkably similar to these copies... of old woodcuts and medieval drawings... of a fire demon invoked by witchcraft to destroy an enemy.
You mean you think that thing committed the murder?
I thought the purpose of our convention was to disprove that type of thinking.
- Yes, but Mark says--
- I'll speak for myself, Llyod.
I'm a scientist also, Dr. Holden.
I know the value of the cold light of reason.
But I also know the deep shadows that light can cast.
The shadows that can blind men to truth.
What truth? Myths.
Demonology and witchcraft have been discredited... since the Middle Ages.
I wrote a book about it.
That's why I'm here.
Then explain how an uneducated farmer like Hobart... could know anything about this creature... whose legend has persisted through civilization after civilization.
Babylonian, Baal, Egyptian...
Sethtyphon, Persian, Asmodeus...
Hebraich, Moloch--
Come in.
Good evening. KT Kumar, Bombay, apologizes for being late.
That's quite all right, Kumar.
We're just about to begin.
- This is Dr. Holden.
- How do you do?
Dr. Holden.
I'm very pleased to meet you.
Your work on hypnotism is a great favorite of mine.
Thank you. Now, we were just talking about devils and demons.
What are your views on the subject?
I believe in them.
Absolutely.
You'll find the library straight through, sir.
I'm sorry, sir, but the last volume you asked for--
The True Discoveries of the Witches and Demons-- is not available.
What does ''not available'' mean?
It should be in our restricted section.
The only known existing copy... is over 400 years old, you know.
Yes, I know.
It seems to be missing.
Most peculiar.
I'm having it checked.
It was mentioned in these research notes.
Never mind. I can probably find what I want in these.
I hope so, sir.
I'll do my best to trace it.
Excuse me, sir.
I couldn't help overhearing your conversation with the librarian.
You're interested in seeing The True
Discoveries of Witches and Demons.
- Is that it?
- Yes.
I have a copy I'll gladly put at your disposal.
Then the British Museum didn't have the only copy.
Apparently not, Dr. Holden.
I have what is perhaps the finest library in the world... on witchcraft and the black arts.
- You know my name.
- Oh, yes.
And you know mine.
I'm Julian Karswell.
It's rather difficult to talk here.
Why not come out to my place in the country? The book's there.
If I don't find what I want,
I might take you up on that.
Delighted.
Just one thing.
Let's understand each other.
My investigation of you and your cult... won't be stopped.
But if I could make my point,
I could persuade you.
I'm not open to persuasion.
But a scientist should have an open mind.
That's what investigations are for.
Well... in any event, here's my card.
Lufford Hall.
It's near Wargrave.
I'll be seeing you soon, I'm sure.
Excuse me.
How clumsy.
I'm so, so sorry.
Here are your papers, sir.
- Thank you.
- Good-bye.
Don't leave it too long.
Can I help you, sir?
Did you see that man who was just here?
I can't say that I did.
- What do you make of this?
- It's a visiting card.
No, I mean the handwriting on it.
- No handwriting.
- Yes, there is.
Forget it.
Nice of you to drop in, Kumar.
Good evening, Holden.
Why, Mr. Holden.
Are you ill?
- I'm all right. Hello, Mark.
- I phoned you earlier.
The authorities have been difficult about cooperating on Hobart.
We need the family to sign a release.
I have it here.
If it's gonna be that much trouble, forget it.
His memory patterns are probably worthless anyway.
Besides, I've met this Karswell.
- He's just a harmless faker.
- You are a very skeptical man.
That's what Karswell said.
- Care for a nightcap?
- I wouldn't mind.
Haven't you gentlemen heard that alcohol is the devil's brew?
And interested as I am in the devil,
I never indulge, thank you.
O'Brien, don't you think that...
O'Brien, don't you think that... skepticism is the scientific attitude?
Oh, sometimes.
All good scientists are from Missouri.
In other words, they should continually be saying, ''Show me.''
- And if you are shown?
- Then I'll look twice.
- Like water?
- No, thank you.
The whole question of this demon monster... that you think shocked Hobart out of his mind... is a perfect example of auto-suggestion and mass hysteria.
Just the same as flying saucers.
Someone imagines that they see moving lights in the sky.
And the next thing, a thousand hysterical witnesses... turn up all over the world swearing that Martians are attacking us.
And now, this nonsense.
It even affects serious men like yourselves.
Sometimes, even me.
But logic-- the reality of the seeable and the touchable-- that's what convinces me finally.
Certainly not rumor or intuition or funny feelings.
Here's how.
I wouldn't dream of arguing with you.
You say, ''Show me.''
I say, ''Look for yourself.''
You know, the devil has something here.
Very pleasant.
He's most dangerous when he's being pleasant.
Look, Mark,
I don't want to be arbitrary... about this Hobart business, if you're so set on it.
- Let me think it over, will you?
- We haven't much time.
- This is the release form.
- Thank you.
I wonder... if either of you could recognize this tune.
It goes something like this.
And then it goes--
Sounds like a distortion of an Irish folk tune.
About the devil, I believe.
Present devils excepted, of course.
A most odd coincidence.
For in Northern India there is a similar tune... which is also part of an enchantment spell.
Well, that takes care of that.
I guess I must have heard it somewhere.
It kept running through my mind.
Tell me, what have you got in your program for the convention tomorrow?
Only a few sessions on extrasensory perception.
The timetable is over there on the desk.
I'd like to watch you work.
Do you mind?
Not at all.
Be glad to have you.
Holden, you are not leaving us after the 28th, are you?
No. Why did you ask that?
Well, it's just that all the pages after the 28th are torn out.
I can't find anything on this card.
- Nothing at all?
- No.
I could try some absorption tests, but that would take time.
- How much time?
- Tonight?
Fine. Call me at my hotel when it's finished.
- Aren't you--
- Yes, on the plane.
- Did you know the professor?
- Did you?
Yes, I worked with him.
I'm John Holden.
Then I must talk to you.
It's very important.
I'm Joanna Harrington.
Professor Harrington was my uncle.
- My deepest sympathies.
- Thank you.
- When can we meet?
- Tonight?
- Call me at my hotel.
- All right.
- 41 2. Down to the left, miss.
- Thank you.
- Well, come in.
- Thanks.
So you really are Dr. Holden?
All scientists don't wear thick glasses.
I apologize for bothering you on the plane.
What was all that writing about anyway?
Letters to my pupils about my trip to America.
I'm a kindergarten teacher.
I'm sorry it ended so tragically for you.
- Thank you.
- Sit down, won't you?
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thanks.
You don't mind if I have one, do you?
I need it.
It's cold tonight, isn't it?
No, it's hot.
Quite hot.
Do you think so?
I heard you're continuing my uncle's project.
And?
I believe you're in danger.
I found my uncle's diary.
It's all in here.
- You make it sound very menacing.
- It is.
I think it had something to do with my uncle's death.
Something horrible happened to him.
Something unexplainably horrible.
- I'd like to read it to you.
- Go ahead.
''Met Karswell at Albert Hall concert.''
He puts three exclamation marks after that sentence.
Karswell can be a pretty startling character.
- You've met him?
- This morning.
Listen to this.
''Karswell most pleasant.
Lost my program during concert, and Karswell gave me his.
A nice gesture, since I save them.''
That doesn't sound particularly menacing.
Wait.
''Today I found the parchment... in the concert program
Karswell gave me.
It had runic symbols drawn on it.''
That's not mysterious.
Runic symbols are the oldest form of an alphabet.
They're found carved on ancient stones, like hieroglyphics.
They're supposed to have magic powers.
They don't.
''The parchment acted as if it were alive.
It pulled from my hand and flew into the fire and burned.
I think I can guess what Karswell has done to me.
I'm under some kind of witch's spell.
My mind is in the balance.
Must speak to Holden about this.''
Unfortunately, you came too late.
What you're trying to tell me is... your uncle was killed by witchcraft.
As a doctor,
I can assure you you're wrong.
Please don't treat me like a mental patient who has to be humored.
I also majored in psychology.
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean--
- You could learn a lot from children.
They believe in things in the dark until we tell them it's not so.
Maybe we've been fooling them.
Good night, Dr. Holden.
I'm really quite flattered you've taken such an interest in my welfare.
Don't be. If I hadn't been away, my uncle might still be alive.
- It was an accident.
- I don't believe that.
I loved my uncle very much, and I want to know exactly what happened to him.
You don't seem to share my view.
Good night.
Wait just a minute.
I've tested this card through and through.
There's been no chemical used on it.
Are you sure? Couldn't it have rubbed off in my pocket?
Maybe, but some of it certainly would have been absorbed into the card... and my absorption tests would have shown it.
This card is 1 00% clean.
I guarantee it.
I see.
Well, thank you.
How would you like to show me the way to Lufford Hall... and the friendly
Mr. Karswell tomorrow?
- Then you think--
- Don't jump to conclusions.
I just wanna borrow a book from him and discuss a chemistry problem.
- Are you sure this is Karswell's place?
- That's what it said back there.
I don't know what his racket is, but it pays very well.
Sounds like a human sacrifice.
Well, you remember the magic word, of course.
- Yeah!
- Now!
It's magic.
Just a tame magician.
So that was it.
That was what?
The answer to my chemistry problem.
Why don't--
Right, children. Now, just be good for a few minutes.
I shall be back.
- Holden. Delighted to see you.
- I hope we're not intruding.
Not at all.Just my annual Halloween party for the village children.
I'll come right up.
- He's just a nice old guy.
- Perhaps he's Santa Claus in disguise.
I didn't recognize you.
I used to earn my living like this years ago.
You see before you
Dr. Bobo the Magnificent.
Excuse me.
This is Miss Joanna Harrington.
- Miss, uh, not by any chance--
- Yes. He was my uncle.
I was very sorry to hear of his accident.
He was a man of great principle.
Mother?
I'd like you to meet my mother.
You must try her homemade ice cream.
She's very proud of it.
- May I introduce Dr. Holden.
- How do you do?
And Miss Joanna Harrington.
Miss Harrington is a niece of Henry Harrington's.
Dr. Holden's going to borrow a book from my library.
- I've asked them to stay.
- How nice. Do you like ice cream?
- Yes, I love it.
- Come with me. I'll give you a treat.
- Would you like to try some?
- Not right now, thank you.
Say, this is quite a place you have here.
Yes, yes.
Let me show you around.
Snakes and Ladders. An English game.
You wouldn't know it.
You see, if you land at the foot of the ladder, you climb up to the top.
But if you land on the head of a snake, you slide all the way down again.
Funny thing.
I always preferred sliding down the snakes to climbing up the ladders.
You're a doctor of psychology.
You ought to know the answer to that.
Maybe you're a good loser.
I'm not, you know.
Not a bit.
Just how much do you know about this book that you're after?
Not very much. Only that Professor
Harrington referred to it in his notes.
A remarkable work. The few men that really understood it... learned many strange and terrifying secrets.
Only a few?
Is it that hard to understand?
I spent my life trying to decipher it.
The ancient sorcerers who wrote it knew their information... was far too valuable to entrust to any known language.
I didn't realize what I was asking for.
You don't believe in witchcraft?
Do you?
Do I believe in witchcraft?
What kind of witchcraft?
The legendary witch that rides on the imaginary broom?
The hex that tortures the thoughts of the victim?
The pin stuck in the image that wastes away the mind and body?
Also imaginary.
But where does imagination end and reality begin?
What is this twilight-- this half-world of the mind that you profess to know so much about?
How can we differentiate between the powers of darkness... and the powers of the mind?
- This is a stick-up!
- How terrifying.
What do I see here?
Yes, some chocolate, I do believe.
And there as well.
Here we are.
Gosh! Chocolate!
Wonderful, aren't they?
If only we grown-ups... could preserve their capacity for simple joys and simple beliefs.
I see you practice white magic as well as black.
Oh, yes.
I don't think it would be too amusing for the youngsters... if I conjured up a demon from hell for them.
Or for myself, for that matter.
As we're not protected by the magic circle, we'd both be torn to shreds.
And you'd spoil the party.
You're so right.
But how to prove my point.
There. It's done.
What is?
A magician doesn't like to expose his magic, black or white.
- Where are the others?
- They probably went 'round by the back.
I didn't know you had cyclones in England.
We don't.
- You probably could use a drink.
- The perfect host.
This way.
I'm sorry. I miscalculated.
The wind's stronger than I expected.
Much too much.
You're talking in riddles.
To prove my point.
A medieval witch's specialty-- a wind storm.
Take my professional advice and stick to rabbits and puppy dogs.
You think I'm mad?
Unfortunately, you won't be able... to explain away your death on the 28th of this month so easily... with my prediction of it at this moment.
You're really serious, aren't you?
You will die as I said... at 1 0:00 on the 28th of this month.
Your time allowed is just three days from now.
''My time allowed.''
Oh, yes, your trick with the card.
Very good too.
I'm sorry you remain so skeptical.
But as the time gets closer, mental disintegration will set in.
First, weakness and unsureness.
And then horror, as the fear of what is behind you grips your heart.
Because it's there, Dr. Holden.
It's there!
It has been from the moment we met in the museum.
You actually believe this nonsense.
I asked you to drop this ridiculous investigation.
Perhaps you will before it's too late.
Well, it's nice to know that
I do have a way out, Mr. Karswell.
The choice is yours.
I hope we don't run out of candles before the power lines are repaired.
Don't you think eating by candlelight is romantic?
Yes, but not on a night like this.
Shall we have some brandy in the living room?
I could use something to warm me up.
Don't say it.
I know you think it's hot in here.
No. As a matter of fact, it's rather chilly.
Do you know The Ancient Mariner?
Vaguely. I read it in school.
I found a copy of it in my uncle's desk.
He underlined one part.
''Like one that on a lonesome road doth walk in fear and dread... because he knows a frightful fiend... doth close behind him tread.''
I hope you don't read poems like that to your kindergarten class.
When it's important that a child learn something...
I use the most direct means available.
I get it, teach.
He scribbled a note on the next page.
I never had a kindergarten teacher as pretty as you are.
- I'm serious.
- So am I.
You wouldn't deny a dying man a last request, would you?
You'll listen whether you like it or not. You haven't much time left.
''Today I found all the pages of my desk calendar... torn out after October the 22nd.''
I know why.
He died on the 22nd.
John, what's the matter?
The same thing happened to my desk calendar, after the 28th.
And I know why.
You put the two together, and they add up to a very obvious trick.
You see, when a tribal witch doctor puts a hex on his victim... he always lets the victim know well beforehand.
Let me see your uncle's diary.
In case it would make you feel better... a parchment has to be passed... and the person has to take it without knowing.
My mother taught me never to take anything from strangers.
- I still don't.
- Then what killed my uncle?
An accident with a falling power line killed him.
Then he should only have been burned.
His body was mutilated horribly.
The police said it could've been an animal.
The only thing they didn't say was what kind of animal.
What do you expect me to do?
Nobody's free from fear.
I have an imagination like anyone else.
It's easy to see a demon in every dark corner.
But I refuse to let this thing take possession of my good senses.
If this world is ruled by demons and monsters, we may as well give up now.
Nobody said we were ruled by them.
You just want me to give in to
Karswell's carefully calculated threats.
That's exactly what he wants me to do.
Because he knows he can't stand up to a real investigation.
If he's so all-powerful, what's he so afraid of?
I wish I knew.
Are you sure Karswell never passed anything or gave you anything... on which the runes could have been written?
- What if he did?
- Did he?
Well, he could have at the museum when my notes fell to the floor.
As a matter of fact, he mentioned the museum the other day.
Yes?
Well, he picked up the papers and handed 'em back to me.
- Where are they now?
- At my hotel, I suppose.
No.
They're in my briefcase.
I have it here.
He did give you the parchment.
- It's trying to escape!
- It's just the wind.
But it is trying to escape into the fire!
It's the draft from the chimney.
What made them stop?
I don't know.
That's it, sir.
Number 44.
Thank you.
Over here,John.
I'm sorry I'm late. I just got back to the hotel and found your message.
It's only a minute or two.
I wanted to wait and go in with you.
- What is this all about?
- I'm not sure I know.
That's why I asked you to come here.
I didn't want to have to explain.
I promised Mrs. Karswell
I'd bring you here.
- Mrs. Karswell?
-John, she wants to help you.
I thought we might take a chance.
I mean, I thought... at least we might learn something.
After this afternoon, I must confess there are a few things I don't know.
I'm so glad you've come, both of you.
Mr. Meek has just telephoned.
He's on his way.
- May I ask who Mr. Meek is?
- The gentleman I want you to meet.
And this is Mrs. Meek.
Miss Harrison--
I mean Harrington, and Dr. Holden.
- How do you do?
- Excuse me, please.
Don't you worry. All your problems will be solved. You'll see.
That's very nice.
May I ask how?
- Through tonight's seance.
- Seance?
Yes. Mr. Meek is the most remarkable medium.
I come to him with all my problems.
Here he is now.
John, she's trying to help you.
I said I'd talk to her.
But this nonsense--
- These things are all phony.
- Oh, please.
You'll hurt Mr. Meek's feelings.
- He really is a most wonderful man.
- Well, good evening.
'Tis a good evening too.
A little warm, perhaps.
Mr. Meek, this is Dr. Holden.
So you're the gentleman who was in trouble. Maggie, dear?
Well, life's full of little problems, isn't it?
Let's see. What's yours?
No, perhaps you better not tell me.
The spirits sometimes resent previous knowledge.
Well, let's see if we can clear the air.
Well, let's see if we can clear the air.
Not being part of the circle, you two had better sit by the window.
Well, Maggie, no point in wasting these good people's time.
I must be insane to get involved in a thing like this.
John, please.
Very well, Maggie.
Cherry ripe
Cherry ripe
Ripe, I cry
Full and fair ones
We must all sing.
The spirits like it.
He's going off.
That's really very quick.
He's so helpful, you'll see.
Mrs. Karswell--
Something's here.
Can't you feel it?
That's Crimson Eagle.
He's Mr. Meek's guide.
He's a Red Indian Chief from an obscure part of your country.
Well, a kindly good evening to you, friends.
Good evening, Mr. McGregor.
That's Mr. McGregor.
He always comes through.
He's a friend of ours.
Bonny weather we're having.
It'll do a mickle of good to the flowers and the barley.
Lovely weather, Mr. McGregor.
But I sense we have strangers in our midst.
Two strangers.
But they're very sympathetic.
Will ya ha' them into the circle?
That's really a great honor.
Mr. McGregor's so particular who sits in the circle. Here.
Over here, both of you.
- It's my uncle.
- Don't be foolish.
- Are you there,Joanna?
- Yes.
- These things are all faked.
- But it is my uncle! I know his voice!
Please!
You'll hurt Mr. Meek.
Got to--
Got to tell Holden... he can't fight it.
It's too strong.
He means you must give up the investigation.
- This is crazy.
- Karswell has the key.
He's translated the old book.
The answer is there.
- No!
- Look!
It's in the trees!
It's coming!
The demon!
It's coming! No!
That does it.
Don't turn the light on!
He's in a trance!
- A trance my eye.
- Maggie, I feel sick.
- You're not the only one.
- He's still alive, no thanks to you.
Don't you know that to wake a medium out of a trance is to risk his life?
But it was real!
You must do as he says.
Don't you understand?
Oh, dear.
Mr. Holden!
Don't go, Mr. Holden!
Oh, Mr. Holden, you must listen!
Mr. Meek knew nothing!
Let them go. All right, Mother.
Come along with me.
But I tell you, it did sound like my uncle's voice.
It was Mr. Meek doing voice impersonations.
And your supposed friend,
Mrs. Karswell, staged the whole thing.
She's looking out for her son's interests, not mine.
Tomorrow's the 28th.
That would be a real miracle if Karswell could change time.
What if we did find he really had a translation of that book.
Would that convince you that there is something in all this?
It might help.
Then I'm going to Karswell's house to see if I can find it.
Go ahead.
Aren't you even going to try to stop me?
It would be easier to stop Karswell's demon... than a woman who has her mind made up.
No lights are showing.
If anybody finds you there, the charge will be burglary.
Karswell is away.
His mother told me.
If you find a reception committee waiting for you... will you believe then that
Mrs. Karswell loves her son, not us?
I hope that's what does happen.
Don't you see
I want to be wrong?
There's nothing I'd like better than to find out... that this is all being put on just to scare you off.
Where are you going?
- To see if I can get into the house.
- But it was my idea.
You didn't think for a minute that
I'd let you go in there, did you?
- I'll go with you.
- No, it'll be much easier for me.
I can get next to the house by going through the woods without being seen.
And with you waiting,
I'll hurry back.
- Why did you drop the poker?
- It's red-hot.
It isn't, you know.
My boy, you're as pale as death.
There was something in here.
Nothing to worry you.Just a minor demon I set to protect the room.
Nothing like the real thing when you meet it.
It may have been minor, but it had claws and teeth.
Oh, claws and teeth.
Did you bite the man?
Oh, shame.
I don't keep you as a watch cat.
I left the book in full sight for him.
His name is Greymalkin.
A very fashionable name for English cats in the Middle Ages.
- They were used in witchcraft.
- It was not that cat.
Oh, yes, it was.
You must have awakened him.
You shouldn't have, at the time of the full moon... when cats wander and witches dance.
Oh, yes. They do dance.
I've seen them.
- You really are crazy, aren't you?
- On the contrary. You seem unhinged.
Is breaking into my house to read my scribbles an indication of sanity?
- I was talked into that.
- Ah, Miss Harrington, no doubt... that horribly bright young woman.
- I don't think she'd be flattered.
- At least her head isn't in the sand.
She believes that she can see.
She can.
She believes that she's alive.
She is.
She believes that you'll die tomorrow night. You will.
Julian, I thought I heard--
It's all right, Mother.Just a social visit. Dr. Holden was just leaving.
- Is your car outside?
- Housebreakers don't leave cars.
You have a point there. Give my regards to that intelligent young woman.
If you're thinking of going through the woods, you might find it unpleasant.
I suggest you use the drive.
I'll put on the light for you.
I have one superstition--
I like to go back the way I came.
He's a very obstinate young man.
I told him not to go through the woods.
He just wouldn't listen.
It was dark in the trees... and I saw this smoke.
I know this sounds crazy, but...
I could've sworn the smoke came after me.
And don't forget
Karswell tore out those pages.
I mean, the book must have had the answer.
Why would he have torn them out otherwise?
Quite. One usually has a reason for tearing things out.
And this feeling of being followed.
And Karswell says
Dr. Holden will die tomorrow night.
Of this enchantment thing?
Forget the hex. Let's say something came after me. Take it from there.
We've been through all of this before.
Frankly, I think a bit of sleep is indicated.
It's extraordinary how different a thing can look in the morning.
- But there's so little time!
- If what you say is true.
- But it is! All of it!
- Doctor...
I don't think Scotland Yard can be anything but an interested spectator.
- I see your point.
- You mean, Uncle, you have a victim?
You already have one-- my uncle.
Have we got anything in criminal records to cover phantoms and demons?
- Not that I know of.
- I didn't think so.
You're right. It will seem different in the morning.
But it is morning. It's 3:00 in the morning, to be exact.
If you insist on setting the wheels grinding, will you please wait here?
Spare me a minute, sir.
There's a Dr.John Holden outside, sir.
- The psychology chap?
- That's it, sir.
It's-- It's a bit awkward.
He's--
It seems he's bewitched.
You know, broomsticks and all that.
Thinks he's being followed by something.
Apparently, he's going to die tomorrow night.
- Does he say so?
- Well, not exactly, sir.
There's a young lady with him, a Miss Harrington.
Apparently, her uncle went through the same thing.
Thought he was being followed by something or other.
Thought he was going to die on a certain night at 1 0:00.
Did he?
That's the thing that's got me puzzled, sir. He did.
You look angry.
Maybe that's because I am.
- With me, for bringing you here?
- No. At myself... for not realizing what their attitude was bound to be.
Look,Joanna, let me tell you something about myself.
When I was a kid, I used to walk down the street with the other kids.
When we'd come to a ladder, they'd all walk around it.
I'd walk under it,just to see if anything would happen.
Nothing ever did.
When they'd see a black cat... they'd run the other way to keep it from crossing their path.
But I didn't, and all this ever did for me... was make me wonder why-- why people could get so panicky over absolutely nothing at all.
I've made a career studying it... maybe just to prove one thing-- that I'm not a superstitious sucker like about 90 percent of humanity.
But what did you run from in the woods?
It was a trick gadget that Karswell had rigged up to frighten me away... and I fell for the bait like an idiot.
But he told you himself not to go back through the trees.
That's good psychology.
The same as he used when he had your sweet old Mrs. Karswell... plant the story about his being away.
Don't bother about him.
He thinks I'm crazy anyway.
I'm beginning to think so myself.
Allowing myself to be stampeded like this into a state of hysteria--
I suppose you mean by me.
I didn't say you were doing it deliberately.
But that's what you meant.
Good night, Dr. Holden.
When your partner comes out, tell him it was just a bad Halloween joke.
I want to clear up everything today, even if it means... having the closing session tonight.
- Is that all right with you?
- Fine.
Hobart's been send down today by ambulance under guard.
I want to get back to the States as soon as possible.
I'll get it.
You finish your breakfast.
Yes?
Who's calling?
It's Mrs. Karswell.
Tell her I cut my throat.
Anything. Get rid of her.
She's been calling all night.
Dr. Holden has just left for the day. I'm sorry.
Hmm?
She's hung up.
Karswell's working his mother overtime.
Let's go, shall we?
All of us here know that through the use of hypnotism... we can unlock certain sections of the human mind... that are not accessible to memory.
A great deal of publicity has been given lately...
A great deal of publicity has been given lately... to hypnotized persons who supposedly recall... an existence prior to birth.
In all cases, we must ask ourselves...
''Do hypnotized people always tell the truth?''
The subject of hypnotism brings us to a presentation... of the late Professor Harrington's study and investigation... of people who follow witch cults... and practice devil worship.
We're going to perform an experiment on the platform... with a Mr. Rand Hobart... who, through an experience related to devil worship... has lost all contact with reality.
Professor O'Brien, the platform is yours.
We have here an extraordinary subject.
For a period of time, this man has been as you see him here.
He fails to respond to any normal stimulation.
His experience, whatever it was... which we hope here to discover, has left him... in a state of absolute catatonic immobility.
When I first investigated this case, the problem of how to hypnotize... an unresponsive person was the major one.
Now, the proceedings may be somewhat dramatic, but they are necessary.
The only way of bringing his mind out of the womb of darkness... into which it has retreated to protect itself... is by therapeutic shock-- electrical or chemical.
For our purpose, we are today using pentathol... and later methyl amphetamine.
Hobart, look at this.
Look at this.
You see only this.
You see nothing else.
Only the light.
Only this.
You see only the light.
Look at this.
You see only this.
You see nothing else.
You see only this.
Your eyelids are getting heavy.
Tired.
More and more tired.
You're going to sleep.
Sleep.
Calm, restful sleep.
Rest. Sleep.
Now.
You hear nothing but my voice.
Do you understand, Hobart?
You hear nothing but my voice.
The patient is now in a deep trance and will obey the commands of Dr. Holden.
Methyl amphetamine.
- Do you wish to proceed?
- No, I'll turn him over to you.
- Do you wish to proceed?
- No, I'll turn him over to you.
Hobart, you'll next hear the voice of Prof. O'Brien.
From that point on, it will be his voice and his alone... that you will hear and obey.
Do you understand that?
Yes?
- Do you hear me?
- Yes.
Mine is the only voice you'll hear.
Is that clear?
Yes.
Only you.
Hobart, what is the order of the true believer?
Those of us who believe that... evil is good... and good evil.
And who revealed this to you, Hobart?
Who?
The one who has brought us the wisdom... of the true belief.
-Julian Karswell?
- Yes.
Now, I want you to come forward in time.
It is the night of the demon.
You must.
It is the night of the demon.
No! It's there.
I see it in the trees... the smoke and the fire.
My time allowed is almost over.
Hobart, what do you mean,
''your time allowed''?
He's not in rapport with you.
Want me to turn him over?
- Yes, please.
- Hobart... from now on, the only voice you'll hear is that of Dr. Holden.
Do you understand?
What do you mean by
''your time allowed''?
To prepare for my death.
Why must you die?
I've been chosen.
How will you die?
The parchment was passed to me.
I took it without knowing.
Hobart, open your eyes.
Is this the parchment?
I passed it back to the brother who gave it to me.
It was the only way.
I had to return it to him.
I didn't want to, but it was the only way I could save myself.
To save yourself, you had to give it back to the one who gave it to you?
Yes. Yes.
I had to.
And the demon took him.
Not me! Not me!
You're trying to pass it to me again.
But I won't take it.
I won't!
Let it escape!
Let it escape!
It was born in fire!
Let it die in fire!
Oh, this is terrible.
Really terrible.
Could you get me a car to take me to Lufford Hall?
You can use mine.
But why should you want to go there?
I have something to return to Mr. Karswell. Give me the key.
Certainly.
Dr. Holden. Wait.
- I do not believe he's there.
- How do you know?
Mrs. Karswell told me earlier on the telephone.
Knowing your attitude, I told her you would not be interested. Are you?
- Yes, I am.
- She kept saying all evil must end... but how could it?
- Go on.
- I hardly understood her... but it seems that her son is taking the 8:45 train to Southampton tonight.
- Would you know why?
- The 8:45.
Has the Southampton train come through yet?
- She's in the station now.
- Give me one ticket, please.
Good evening, Dr. Holden.
My boy.
I've been expecting you.
Joanna.
First-stage hypnosis.
Oh,just a convenient way of stopping idle chatter on the train.
She's not harmed.
I'll bring her out of it.
Now, wake.
There's a friend here.
Talk to him.
-John.
- This is abduction, you know.
Oh, dear me, no, no, no.
She came quite willingly.
You came willingly, didn't you?
You remember.
We discussed it... oh, at great length.
John, he's frightened-- terrified of you.
I thought it was supposed to be the other way around.
- He's trying to run away from you.
- You see why I let her sleep?
This idle chatter.
Karswell, I know now... that you were right and I was wrong.
Really?
But there is a way out for me.
You always said so.
- Here.
- What's this?
Read it.
You want me to admit your power.
You can send this to any newspaper... and photostatic copies to all your followers.
- Isn't that what you want?
- Yes, but it's too late now.
It's six minutes to 1 0:00.
Well, I guess it was my fault for not listening toJoanna.
I'm sorry now that I didn't listen.
And I want to thank you for convincing me... of the existence of a world
I never thought possible.
Oh, if only you'd understood sooner.
I suppose...
I still have time for a last cigarette.
No, thank you.
I've stopped smoking.
It must have been quite recently.
- Have you got a match?
- Yes, of course.
Thank you.
That's all right. You keep them.
I shan't need them anymore.
You're very generous.
Well, I'll leave you two alone.
I know there's a certain feeling between you, and you might want to be alone.
Sit down. Your generosity is becoming overwhelming as it gets closer to 1 0:00.
You're staying with me, Karswell.
You've sold your bill of goods too well, because I believe you now.
I believe that in five minutes... something monstrous and horrible is going to happen.
And when it does, you're going to be here... so that whatever happens to me will happen to you.
You're insane.
You can't do this.
No?
You're staying here, Karswell.
- You're staying right here.
- No!
Let him go, Holden!
- This man's insane. I must go.
- It's all right, Doctor.
We're the police, as Holden knows.
We've had you under observation at his request.
- Fortunately for you, as you can see.
- Yes, I see. Thank you.
It's obvious that Holden has got a bit of a persecution complex about you.
Something about your putting a hex on him.
That's ridiculous. If you'll excuse me,
I'm getting out of this station.
Johnny, he's lying. He bought a ticket to Southampton. I saw it myself.
This is idiotic.
I can leave this train when I want.
- Excuse me.
- Here's your book.
It's not mine.
I found it here when I got on the train.
- Your bag, sir?
- My bag-- Oh, yes.
- Yes, of course.
- These are his too.
You want your hat and coat, don't you, sir?
Oh, yes. Very forgetful of me.
Thank you very much.
You passed them.
You slipped them in my pocket.
- It's two minutes of 1 0:00.
- Come on.
- What was that?
- Come on.
- There's a man on the track!
- What happened?
I don't know, but I think the train's hit him.
Maybe it's better not to know.
The train must have hit him and dragged him.
I thought he was on the other side, sir.
Don't be ridiculous, Simmons.
Look at him.
The train must have hit him.
You're right.
Maybe it's better not to know.
In WWI, for the first time ever,
nations combined to fight nations,
using the crude weapons of the day.
WWII involved every continent.
Science provided new tools of war.
These reached an unparalleled peak
in their capacity for destruction.
Now, fought with the
terrible weapons of super-science,
menacing every creature
on Earth, comes...
No one would have believed,
in the middle of the 20th century,
human affairs were being closely
watched by a greater intelligence.
Yet, across the gulf of space,
on the planet Mars,
intellects vast and unsympathetic
regarded our Earth enviously,
slowly and surely
drawing their plans against us.
Mars is more than 140 million miles
from the sun.
For centuries it has been
in the last stages of exhaustion.
At night, temperatures drop
far below zero, even at its equator.
The inhabitants of this dying planet
looked across space with instruments
of which
we have scarcely dreamed,
searching for another world
to which they could migrate.
They could not go to Pluto,
outermost of all planets,
and so cold that its atmosphere
lies frozen on its surface.
They couldn't use Neptune or Uranus,
twin worlds in eternal night,
both surrounded by an atmosphere
of methane gas and ammonia vapor.
They considered Saturn, attractive
with its moons and rings,
but its temperature is
close to 270 degrees below zero,
and ice lies 15,000 miles deep
on its surface.
Their nearest world was Jupiter,
with giant cliffs of lava and ice,
with hydrogen flaming at the tops.
The atmosphere is awful. Thousands
of pounds to the square inch.
They couldn't go there, nor to Mercury,
nearest planet to the sun.
It has no air. The temperature at
its equator is that of molten lead.
Of all the worlds the life forms
on Mars could see and study,
only our own Earth was green
with vegetation, bright with water,
and possessed a cloudy atmosphere
eloquent of fertility.
It did not occur to mankind that a
swift fate might be hanging over us.
Or that from the blackness of outer
space we were being scrutinized.
Till the time we drew close to Mars'
orbit, during a pleasant summer...
- Is that a fireball or something?
- Boy, that's big.
- I wonder where it hit?
- Probably halfway to Pomona.
I'm gonna see. Who's coming?
This is Pine Summit. I got a smoke.
- Azimuth: 160 degrees, 30 minutes.
Big? I bet it's as big as anything that ever lit in California.
Better get something over there.
It's started a blaze already.
Number Three to D.O.
- D.O. to Number Three, come in.
- We're getting this under control.
Okay, send the tanker in, but you
stand by until that thing cools off.
- Someone ought to check on it.
- There's scientists fishing nearby.
They probably saw it come down.
I'll tell them. What's it look like?
It's too hot to get near enough for a good look, but it's enormous.
I got a message for you. You're the guys from Pacific Tech, ain't you?
- Looks like the fishing was good.
- Have some?
Well, I might just do that.
It's about that meteor.
They say it's a whopper.
They phoned us up on the summit.
I thought you might be interested.
- About 10 miles from here.
- It didn't come down like a meteor.
That's right.
It came down in spurts.
You fellows figure it out.
You're scientists.
It's big as a house and red-hot.
- I'll borrow your car and take a look.
- We ought to get back.
- I'll fly Bilder back down in your plane.
- Okay, the insurance is paid up.
- Light?
- No, I'll smoke it later.
Did you watch it come down?
I saw it from my window.
Harold, look here a minute.
Step over a little. Smile.
It must have skidded along the gully.
Then the loose earth shook down over it.
- I guess most of it's buried.
- That's 12 feet thick.
They run heavy. They won't be able to haul this one away to no museum.
A good attraction for Sunday drivers.
Better than a lion farm or snake pit. We won't have to feed it.
- We can sell tamales and hot dogs.
- Ice cream, cold drinks, souvenirs.
- We should put up picnic tables.
- Then they'd bring their own lunch.
- Gonna dig for gold, Buck?
- You think you're kidding?
It'll be like having a gold mine in your own back yard.
I'm gonna get a closer look at it.
- That's it over there.
- It's still pretty darned hot.
- Be careful, Buck.
- Watch it.
- Did you see it come down?
- Yes, I was fishing in the hills.
- That's a lot of tackle.
- The others flew back in my plane.
Why didn't it make a bigger crater?
It hit sideways and skidded in.
That's what I think.
A scientist's coming, he'll tell us.
- Ever hear of Clayton Forrester?
- What's that fellow trying to do?
He's top man in astro and nuclear physics. He knows all about meteors.
- You seem to know all about him.
- I did a thesis on modern scientists.
- Did it do you any good?
- Sure, I got my degree.
- Say, do you have a match?
- No, I'm sorry. I don't smoke.
They had Forrester on the cover of
Time. You have to rate to get that.
- He isn't that good.
- You don't even know him!
- I do know him, slightly.
- What's he like?
Well, he's like...
You don't look like yourself in that get-up, but I'm happy to meet you.
Sylvia Van Buren.
I teach library science at USC.
- I didn't know how to stop you.
- You didn't wear glasses in Time.
They're for long distance. To look at something close, I take them off.
- You could fry eggs on that thing.
- The sand is keeping the heat in.
Uncle, Dr. Forrester. Dr. Matthew
Collins is the pastor here.
- Well, how do you do?
- How do you do, sir?
Hey, you!
What have you got in here?
It's ticking like a bomb.
This is a Geiger counter for detecting radioactivity.
- It's that meteor.
- It's radioactive?
Yes. It's difficult to account for a reaction like that.
- Look at it. It's going crazy!
- Maybe we should keep people away.
I'll post a few deputies.
That meteor is either very light, which is unheard of, or it's hollow.
If it were heavy and solid, it would have made a tremendous crater.
I'll wait around until it cools off.
Is there a place I could clean up?
- I'd like you to stay at my house.
- Thank you.
It won't be cool for 24 hours. What do people do here on a Saturday?
- Not much of anything.
- There's a square dance tonight.
Allemande left and the ladies star.
Gents walk around, but not too far.
Allemande left and the gentlemen star.
Ladies walk around, but not too far.
First and third balance and swing.
Promenade the outside ring.
Three quarters round the outside ring.
Through that couple and not too far.
Meet in the center with right hand star.
Swing your corner with left hand round.
Let's take another look at it.
- It's almost cold now.
- We might as well go home.
- No sense staying out here.
- Let's go.
Hey, it's moving!
- It's a bomb!
- It didn't go off last night...
- Maybe it's gonna go off now.
- It's a sneak attack. Let's go.
Wait a minute.
Bombs don't unscrew.
It's no meteor. That's for sure.
Darnedest thing I ever saw, the way that's unscrewing.
- Thank you, Doctor. Having fun?
- You know what I was thinking?
The energy from one square dance could send the meteor back home.
- Must be somebody in there.
- Who? Where do they come from?
I read that Mars is near Earth now.
It happens every 20 years, they say.
Men from Mars...
- What do you think?
- Maybe these are not men, like us.
Everything human doesn't have to look like you and me.
If it's men from Mars, we ought to let them know we're friendly.
- No, you don't know what it is.
- We'd be the first to make contact.
We'd be in all the papers.
We could walk out there with a white flag.
I got an old sugar sack in my car.
What are we going to say to them?
"Welcome to California."
Come on.
We're friends!
Open up!
- How will they understand us?
- We'll talk in sign language.
Everybody understands that the white flag means we want to be friends.
- Hey there, open up!
- Come on out, we're friends!
- We welcome you!
- We're friends!
No smooching in the dark, folks.
- Any candles around?
- All the lights in town are out.
- Somebody found some candles.
- I like it in the dark.
Call the electric company and see what happened.
- Hey, the phone's gone dead.
- The phone isn't on the same circuit.
What are they saying? Something's wrong with my hearing aid.
We play "Good Night Ladies" at midnight, anyway. It's near that now.
- My watch has stopped.
- I've got the time.
- Mine's stopped, too.
- Mine ain't working. What is this?
They've all stopped at the same time.
There's only one explanation for a thing like this. Do you have a pin?
See that? My watch is magnetized.
That's what knocked the phones out, too.
- But everyone's watches all together?
- Do you have a pocket compass?
- The needle isn't pointing north.
- It's pointing toward the meteor.
Let me through!
- What's going on?
- I don't know any more than you do.
Look at the fire out there!
The power lines are down.
That explains why the lights went out.
- Hey, look at the cars!
- Where are the three men you left?
Look there!
People in town started to follow us.
Don't let them come near here.
Get under cover!
- What is that gizmo?
- A machine from another planet.
We'd better get word to the authorities. Look!
Sheriff, you'd better get word to the military. You'll need them.
Get moving. On the double.
Take cover along the riverbed.
Get those 30s over here.
The area is controlled by Marines.
The gully is surrounded.
Here is Prof. McPherson of Canada.
Is it true you've had reports of landings in other places? Canada?
Not in Canada yet, but in
Bordeaux, France. Some in Spain...
There's supposed to be one down in Italy.
We're trying to locate the second meteor that landed here at midnight.
- Do you think they come from Mars?
- Dr. Forrester?
It's possible. It seems certain they're from some other planet.
If they are Martians, what would
they look like? Bigger? Smaller?
As to Martians, our heavier air
would oppress them.
You think they'd breathe like us.
What about hearts and blood?
If they are Martians, with hearts,
they'd beat at a slower rate.
Their senses could be
quite different from ours.
They may be able to smell colors.
It is possible that they would have
more than one brain.
- Two? Three? Just think of that!
- It's only speculation.
What about these meteor machines?
They're probably controlled by jets,
navigated with a gyroscope system.
Thank you, Doctor. Colonel, can you tell us anything about this plane?
It'll drop a flare. Then Air Force cameramen will get pictures.
There's been a lot of mysterious activity around the machine.
Lights and dust, as if they're digging themselves out. There it comes again!
If it keeps up, it'll be a guide for the plane.
The pilot's just blipped his motor.
That means he's dropped the flare.
We'll be the first men on Earth to get a real look at these invaders from space.
They're after the plane with their rays!
Jump for it!
Here we are...
Hey, they cut me off!
They got my truck!
They'll come out of the gully soon.
Our defenses have to be ready.
- You'll need plenty of reinforcements.
- We'll get them.
- The troops are certainly moving in.
- You sent word to the 6th Army?
No, Col. Heffner's in charge.
You never know where you'll wind up when you go to a square dance.
- That's D-24.
- Correct.
Locate your observation post on this hill.
Position your recoilless 75s back here. Carbon Canyon.
I want your battery here. In daylight you may be exposed. Be ready to pull out.
- But you'll get first crack at them.
- Suits me, sir.
Heffner...
Half-tracks? Okay.
Get in back of Hill Three.
If it's a moving target, follow up from there. Over and out.
They've located that second meteor.
There's one, there's the other.
We're right between them.
- So is the town.
- I warned them to prepare to evacuate.
Everyone has been alerted.
- Gen. Mann, I was told to expect you.
- I'm here to report back, not interfere.
Clayton Forrester,
I haven't seen you since Oak Ridge.
This is Pastor Collins,
Sheriff Bogany, head of local control.
- Miss Van Buren.
- Would you care for some coffee?
Gen. Mann's in charge of intelligence for the Pacific area.
You've certainly got them surrounded.
- They've neutralized communications?
- Not all. The field phones are okay.
A cylinder reported by Huntington
Beach. That's a job for the Navy.
- Any news from abroad?
- We're in touch with their militaries.
They're coming down all over.
Santiago has two cylinders.
They're outside London.
They're in Naples.
We've got them between here and Fresno. Two on Long Island.
- They're coming down at random.
- No.
According to information from foreign sources, they have some kind of plan.
What it is isn't clear yet, because once they begin to move, no more news comes out of that area.
We've had reports of destruction, massacre.
"Town south of Bordeaux wiped out by ray."
"Local reports say nothing remains."
What do you make of that?
- All we've seen is their heat ray.
- Our newest weapons will stop them.
From the data, and that picture the Air Force took tonight, this is the original pilot ship.
Its observations guided the others down.
One lands, then two, making groups of three joined magnetically.
My orders are not to go into action unless they move out of the gully.
This is the only place we have them contained.
What happens here will be a guide to other operations.
When it starts, and a defense pattern develops, I'll report to Washington.
- You've deployed your forces well.
- We'll blast them right off Earth.
They'll probably move at dawn.
There's something moving in the gully.
Look at it.
Beings from another world.
- Is it a flying machine?
- No.
It's supported from the ground by rays.
Probably some form of magnetic flux.
This is amazing!
They must keep the opposing poles in balance and lift the machine.
Stand by to fire.
All command posts, stand by to fire.
- But Colonel, shooting's no good.
- It's always been a good persuader.
Shouldn't you try communicating with them first, then shoot, if you have to?
Target as indicated.
We should try to make them understand we mean them no harm.
There's another machine coming out!
They are living creatures.
They're not human.
They're an advanced civilization.
If they're more advanced than us, they should be nearer the Creator.
No real attempt has been made to communicate with them.
Let's go back inside, Uncle Matthew.
I've done all I can in there.
You go back. Sylvia...
I like that Dr. Forrester.
He's a good man.
Attention all batteries:
Prepare for volley fire.
Who's that?
What is he doing?
- Uncle! Stop him!
- It's too late. He's too far away.
Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil.
It's seen him.
Thou anointest my head with oil.
My cup runneth over.
And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever...
- Let 'em have it!
- Fire!
The shells can't get through. They've put up an electromagnetic covering.
That skeleton beam must be what they used to wipe out the French city.
Cut across their lines of magnetic force and any object will cease to exist.
Take my word for it, General.
This defense is useless against them.
You'd better let Washington know. Fast.
Hold them as long as you can.
Order all command posts to pull back north of the tunnel bunker.
Everybody out of here! The Air Force will take care of these babies now.
Dr. Forrester, get out of here.
Everybody out...
- Can't you go higher?
- The air will be full of jets in a minute.
Read all about the Martian invasion.
They're in New York and Miami.
Fighting outside Los Angeles.
Read all about it.
- Hold it right there, General.
- What do you think of the situation?
- Do you believe we can hold them?
- Sorry, I've no time.
Break it up.
The way he's hedging, maybe we didn't hold them. I've heard news.
Australia, India...
Nobody's stopped them yet.
- If the city must be evacuated...
- Many have already moved out.
- We've mobilized cars and buses.
- The Red Cross is standing by.
The enemy is 30 miles outside Los Angeles.
Not in full force yet, but developing.
It can happen any minute.
- Washington is on the line, sir.
- General Mann.
I'd say our effective losses were 60% men, 90% material.
The jets went in but none came out.
Bombers were knocked out of the sky, and their bombs did nothing.
Their electronic umbrella is quite impenetrable.
Forrester thinks they generate atomic force without the screening we use.
Very well, sir.
Get me the fastest plane we've got.
Now I'll make a statement to those reporters.
All right, the general will see you now.
We heard Forrester was out with you.
What does he think about this?
- Ask him. He's back at Pacific Tech.
- No, he's not. He hasn't shown up.
Wake up.
Let's get moving.
- Are you all right?
- It's that machine!
It's gone.
We're south-west of Corona.
There must have been another cylinder down here. They cleared everyone out.
There's a farmhouse out there.
Let's find something to eat.
We're doing all right.
I almost forgot when I ate last.
That looks good. Mostly I get my meals in coffee shops and restaurants.
- Don't you live at home?
- No, on campus. I haven't any family.
I come from a big one. There's nine of us, all in Minnesota. Except me.
I have no close folks.
My parents died when I was a kid.
A big family must be fun. It must make you feel you belong to something.
It does. Maybe that's why
I feel lost right now.
We'll get out safely. Don't worry.
They murder everything that moves.
If they're mortal, they have mortal weaknesses. They'll be stopped.
I haven't been close enough to them for any real observation.
I feel like I did once when I was small.
Awful scared and lonesome.
I'd wandered off. I've forgotten why.
The family and whole crowds of neighbors were hunting for me.
They found me in a church.
I was afraid to go in anyplace else.
I stayed by that door, praying for the one who loved me best to find me.
- It was Uncle Matthew who found me.
- I liked him.
He liked you.
Oh, I could bawl my head off.
But you won't, you're not the kind.
You're tired. You've been up all night.
You crashed in a plane, slept in a ditch.
You want to know something?
It doesn't show on you at all.
Get down!
- How long was I out?
- Hours. I've been so scared!
They're right outside.
Several of them came down together.
There's a machine standing right alongside of us.
An electronic eye.
Like a television camera.
It's looking for us.
Maybe they're not too sure we're here.
They could be as curious about us as we are about them.
Maybe they want to take us alive.
It's pulling out.
Can't we get out of here?
- Something moved out there.
- There's nothing there now.
- It was one of them!
- What was it like?
- I couldn't see much in the dark.
- I've got to get a good look at them.
- They've blocked it!
- It's blocked here, too.
They've pushed earth all around the outside.
Here, this is the way up to the attic.
Look out!
Your scarf.
It's wet.
Blood...
Stop it. Stop it!
We've got to make a run for it.
Come on!
The Martians had calculated their
descent with amazing perfection.
As more of their cylinders came from
the mysterious depths of space,
their war machines, awesome
in their power and complexity,
created a wave of fear
throughout the world.
Governments tried to coordinate their
defenses with those of other nations.
The government of India
met in a railroad coach,
while millions streamed for the
imagined safety of the Himalayas.
The Finnish, Turkish, Chinese and
Bolivians worked and fought furiously.
Every effort against their other-world
antagonists ended in the same rout.
As the Martians burned fields and
forests, and cities fell before them,
people were driven from their homes.
The stream of flight became a torrent.
It became a giant stampede,
without order or goal.
It was the beginning of the rout of
civilization, the massacre of humanity.
A great silence fell over half of Europe,
as all communication was disrupted.
When the last wire photo out of Paris
reached the exiled French Cabinet,
they hit upon the idea
of usingjets as couriers.
Carrying extra fuel
instead of weapons,
they maintained contact with North
Africa, the US and especially England.
The Martians plainly knew the strategic
significance of the British Isles.
The people of Britain met the invaders
magnificently, but it was unavailing.
As the Martians swept toward London,
the British Cabinet stayed in session,
coordinating every item of
information that could be gathered,
passing it on to the UN in New York,
and from there to Washington,
the only remaining
unassailed strategic point.
It's vital to prevent the Martian machines from linking up.
Once they do, they adopt an extraordinary military tactic.
They form a crescent, anchor it at one end and sweep on until they've cleared a quadrant.
Then they anchor the opposite end and reverse direction.
They slash across country, wiping out everything that's trying to evade them.
That's why communications are cut once they begin moving.
- Montreal's blacked out. Nothing.
- Same thing as on the Pacific coast.
- Anything from them yet?
- Still nothing from San Francisco.
- Here's that Los Angeles picture, sir.
- This is a sonic radar picture.
It shows details of the Martian nest outside Los Angeles.
Their machines appear as round blobs.
Newly fallen cylinders are elongated.
There are three cylinders to each group, three machines to each cylinder.
All right, I've seen enough.
Only one thing will stop them. We've held back because of the radiation.
Now there's no choice. Washington will confirm an order to use the atom bomb.
Our first target will be the initial landing place outside L.A.
Have Pacific Tech monitor the drop.
I'll have the area cleared all around.
We can still hit them before dark.
We'll blast them all over the world.
- We've been looking all over for you.
- We walked half-way from Corona.
This is Miss Van Buren. Dr. Grotzman,
Dr. Pryor, James, Bilderbeck.
- What's this about the A-bomb?
- We're going in right after it.
- What's that?
- An electronic eye.
They modeled it after their own eye.
They use it the way we use a periscope.
- It'll tell us about their metals.
- We can find out about their optics.
- Very interesting.
- And this... the blood of a Martian.
I don't remember ever seeing blood crystals as anemic as these.
They may be mental giants, but by our standards, physically, they must be very primitive.
Everything about them seems to be in threes.
Their eyes have three lenses, three pupils. Strong light shocks them.
Sunlight on Mars is approximately half as strong as we get it.
Add their clouds and dust, it amounts to no more than our twilight.
Now, if you'll step over here, please.
We've rigged the epidiascope to reflect whatever the Martian lens picks up.
Move in a little. Thank you.
There's how the Martians see us.
Evidently there's a shift in their spectrum.
Their color absorption must be different from ours.
Let's see why they were so curious about you, Miss Van Buren.
- Time we got started, gentlemen.
- Let's go.
- Let's make an analysis of their blood.
- It might give us something.
You can get all the Martian blood you want after the plane drops the bomb.
The Flying Wing is going to carry it.
Tower, this is Flying Wing, ready for take-off.
Flying Wing, this is the tower.
Clear for take-off.
Wish us luck.
The target is the nest of
Martian machines in the Puente Hills, where more cylinders came down last evening.
A plane will pinpoint the target from six miles up.
This bomb is ten times more powerful than anything previously used.
It's the latest thing in nuclear fission.
Nothing like it has ever been exploded before. We're going to be pretty close, but there are observers in a forward bunker who will be a lot nearer than us.
The whole world is waiting.
This will decide the fate of civilization.
Whether we live or die may depend on what happens here.
Attention! Four minutes to bomb time.
There must be a couple of million people behind us in the hills, waiting to find out whether they can go home again.
All around the world, people have been driven from their homes.
Direct cable communication is being maintained with Washington, but there's no radio at all. Not even with the bomber that's coming over.
All radio is dead, which means that these recordings are for the sake of future history, if any.
Future history, he said.
Yes, if any.
Bilderbeck's calculated how long we have until they take over the world.
If the A-bomb fails, the Martians can conquer Earth in six days.
The same number of days it took to create it.
Attention! Two minutes to bomb time.
Prepare to take shelter.
If you have no goggles, turn away.
Remember, the heat flash and
concussion that follow are dangerous.
50 seconds.
There's the plane.
40 seconds.
We've sighted the plane, sir.
- 30 seconds.
- Look. Look!
They're using those protective blisters again.
Attention! Stand by.
15 seconds.
10 seconds. 9, 8, 7, 6...
Hello? What can you see?
There's something moving!
They haven't even been touched!
It didn't stop them. Guns, tanks, bombs, they're like toys against them!
It'll end only one way.
We're beaten.
No... Not yet.
Washington ordered all cities in danger of attack evacuated if the bomb fails.
They'll be moving on Los Angeles now.
We'll fight them back to the mountains.
Our best hope lies in what you people can develop to help us.
Six days, you said. Six days...
They'll stamp the city flat.
We'll establish a base laboratory in the Rocky Mountains.
- We'll search out their weaknesses.
- A forlorn hope.
- But there is a chance.
- We may get a lead from the blood.
- By some biological approach?
- We can't beat their machines.
We've got to beat them.
Everybody listen carefully!
The Martians are coming this way.
We must evacuate.
Take food, water and extra clothing.
All highways have been marked to
lead you to welfare centers in the hills.
Keep them rolling!
Come on!
- Gratzman, did you get those biotics?
- No, I thought you had them.
I'll get them. You get in the school bus.
Sylvia will drive you.
Let me up. I'll give you $500 for your place. I'll make it $1,000.
Money's no good anymore!
Here comes another truck!
Throw that guy off there!
Stop, you fools!
You fools!
- Quick, we've got to stop them!
- The law's no good here now.
- The thieves stayed behind.
- It's like this all over.
They must be stopped.
The instruments!
Hold it a minute!
We've got to have those instruments.
They're our only chance!
Did they grab the trucks ahead of me?
Did you see the Pacific Tech people?
I don't know. There's fighting all over.
- Did they get the school bus?
- If they saw it, they took it.
You can't buy a ride for love or money!
Gratzman! Bilderbeck!
Sylvia!
- Hey, you better get out of here!
- I'm looking for Pacific Tech people.
- There's nobody left around here now.
- We could have stopped them.
The mob stole the trucks and smashed everything. They cut their own throats!
He's nuts...
Come on, jump in.
Hurry up. Jump in!
There was a girl with them.
If I could find her...
- She's kind of lost.
- You look kind of lost yourself.
- But I think I know where she'll be.
- It's your last chance to get out of here.
We humbly beseech
Thy divine guidance, O Lord.
Deliver us from the fear which has come upon us.
From the evil that grows ever nearer.
From the terror that soon will knock upon the very door of this, Thy house.
O Lord, we pray Thee.
Grant us the miracle of Thy divine intervention.
Don't go, son. Stay with us.
No, I'm looking for someone.
She'll be in a church, near the door.
- Forrester!
- DuPrey, Bilderbeck! Are you?
- Where are the others?
- We don't know where they are.
I got knocked under our truck.
DuPrey pulled me out.
- What happened to Sylvia?
- We never did see her again.
In our peril we plead.
Succour and comfort us in this hour.
Please, God.
Sylvia!
Sylvia!
- Here! Here!
- Sylvia!
Let me through! Please!
It's quiet. Maybe they've gone away.
(SUDDEN LOUD
CRASHING SOUND)
Something's happening to them.
It's dead.
We were all praying for a miracle.
The Martians had no resistance
to the bacteria in our atmosphere.
Once they breathed our air, germs
harmless to us began to kill them.
The end came swiftly. All over the
world, their machines stopped and fell.
After all that men could do had failed,
the Martians were destroyed
and humanity saved
by the littlest things which God
in His wisdom had put upon this earth.

Are you out of your mind?
Give her another one.
What a way to go.
I really felt we had it.
What's gotten into you?
I warned you at home I don't wanna go there.
Well, you have to.
You can take me there, but I won't stay.
Whew, you could've killed us all.
That's what I tried to do.
The kid's lost her marbles talking wild like that.
I'm certainly glad, Paul, that we're getting rid of her.
Shut up!
That's no way to talk to your mother.
Step-mother, my mother's dead.
Oh, you're back on that track.
And I'll never get off.
I don't approve of your smoking, but I guess one more won't hurt you now.
Let her have a whole pack if it'll help calm her nerves.
I'll handle this, dear.
Now, look, Nancy, we've discussed this back and forth.
Then you ought to know how I feel.
Then why can't you see it my way?
I have a right to remarry.
Oh, you're on that lonesome kick again.
At least you could've waited!
Six weeks, then you married her.
Well, the company shifted me to another city.
I had to make a decision.
I know, they twisted your arm around her.
That'll do, you're selfish.
Maybe your mother spoiled you.
All you think of is yourself.
Me, you're a fine one to talk.
You sell the house, yank ne out of school, you break up my whole social life!
You mean those moonlight beach parties and those rock and roll sessions?
I'm gonna lose all my friends, especially Glenn, and just when we were getting close.
Real close, I can just imagine.
You break it up and now you wanna get rid of me.
Did you expect us to take you along on our honeymoon?
Oh, don't give me that blushing bride routine.
You put a ring through
Dad's nose and...
That'll do!
Well, at least I told you.
And it makes no sense.
Now, we're going, and you'd better keep your hands off the wheel.
Well, at least the storm has let up a bit.
Well,
I gave you up.
You were expected hours ago.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Thorndyke.
I allowed all day for the 300 miles, but this storm and coming through the mountain pass, we nearly skidded off the road.
It was really close.
Well, I'm glad you made it.
I'm sorry I can't offer you something to eat.
That's all right.
We'll get a bite on the way back.
Yes, you should be on your way, both of you.
You've done enough for me.
I'm Nancy Perkins, Mrs.
Thorndyke.
Please forgive us all.
Forget it, Nancy.
Poor girl, you look half frozen.
I'll be all right.
Then we better conclude the formalities, Mrs. Perkins.
Eh, the new Mrs. Perkins.
I lost my wife recently.
Six weeks ago.
In fact, that's why we registered Nancy at Sherwood.
Well, I'm sure you made the right choice.
I think you'll be very happy here, Nancy.
I like the cheery atmosphere.
At first she seemed a little worried.
That's natural, separate anyone from familiar surroundings, the warmth and security of home.
You do understand.
Of course, but I'm sure any strangeness you feel will pass.
She was also worried about the discipline.
Oh now, Nancy, this is not a corrective institution.
Sherwood is a private preparatory school with a very high rating.
All our girls come from fine backgrounds.
There is work, our courses are not easy, but there is also fun.
You'll find out, lots of fun.
Well, I'm glad that's settled.
You know your way back?
It'll be a breeze.
You're driving all the way home tonight?
They'll probably stop at a motel.
Well, goodbye, Nancy, and be sure to write.
Every week.
Say goodbye to.
Goodbye, Doris, take good care of Daddy.
Goodbye, Nancy.
Well, I leave my little girl in your charge.
Goodbye, Mrs. Thorndyke.
Goodbye.
Thank you.
Let's move along, dear.
I'll help you with your luggage,
Nancy.
I'll show you to your room.
It's right up here.
You'll sleep in here tonight.
You'd better go to bed at once.
Naturally, it's too late now, but in the morning I'll introduce you to the girls in your dormitory, five very sweet girls.
Well, goodnight.
Goodnight.
Well, at least you've got sense enough not to fight.
Shocking pink, the first blush of Spring.
And look at the neckline on this blouse.
Oh, this formal, the most.
Take the music and moonlight, and my dream boy.
I hope you kids are having a ball.
Signal when you're through,
I'd like to sack in.
Where'd you hide the cigarettes?
Here they are.
Help yourselves, I'm terribly sorry
I didn't brink a carton.
Uh, maybe we should tell this prize package that it's against the rules to speak until you get permission, or we might have to put you through our course in etiquette.
For instance, do you take off our gloves to eat and drink?
And when your date brings you home, do you give him the key to your front door?
Hey, look at this!
Didn't anyone ever tell you this is bad for your teeth?
Oh, chocolates.
Kids, look at this.
Our little girl's got a dream boy with wavy hair and muscles.
Hey now, knock it off!
Hey, beat it, you guys.
Old horse face is on the warpath.
So, you're the new girl,
Nancy Perkins.
Yes, ma'am.
Well, I'm Miss Rivers and I'm the house mother.
I look after this dormitory and I teach art.
Also, I expect to get eight hours uninterrupted sleep.
Yes, ma'am.
For a new arrival, you certainly can kick up a storm.
I'd never give you an A for tidiness.
Do you have to make so much noise unpacking?
Don't you know everyone's asleep?
I'm sorry, Miss Rivers.
I was looking for something, a hand mirror, a present from my dad.
I, I thought at first that I'd left it home, but then I found it.
Well, you put all these things back neatly, and remember, at Sherwood, we teach our young girls to be neat and quiet, and go to bed.
I hope you slept well, Nancy.
Sometimes a strange bed in a strange place.
Oh no, it was just like home, cozy and quiet.
Good, good morning, girls.
Good morning, Mrs.
Thorndyke.
Sit down, girls.
I'd like you to meet Nancy
Perkins, your new roommate.
This is Myra, Terry,
Nola, Linda, and Anne.
How do you do?
These must be the five sweet girls you told me about.
Exactly, you see, we like to put a new comer in with girls who've been here for awhile for guidance.
They'll show you where your classes are and help you get used to our ways here at Sherwood.
I'm sure they will.
Well, I hope you all get along, and from now on, good luck.
Thank you.
Come on, girls, let's go.
Excuse us, Nancy.
Nancy, I wanna talk to you.
You passed your first test with flying colors.
You didn't snitch.
If there's one thing we can't stand around here, it's a snitch.
I'm glad I made the grade, but don't give me an
A for conduct.
I like to handle things in my own way.
Don't be a meathead.
I'm just taking an interest in you, because you've got spirit.
Just remember, there's no such thing as a lone wolf at Sherwood.
We can make life awfully miserable for oddballs.
I suppose.
First of all, when it comes to classes,
I'm the teacher's assistant in Chemistry.
Secondly, Nola, the girl whose hair you tore out by the roots, she's an English assistant, get it?
I get it.
And then if you wanna have some fun here and be let in on things, you've just gotta be one of us.
How do you get to be one of us?
You'll do what I say.
You'll have to join our secret organization,
Birds of Paradise.
So long as I sponsor you, you're as good as in.
I never won any medals for obedience.
Come on, we'll be late for class.
I'm not hungry anyway.
Hi, Myra.
Oh, hi, Eddie.
Hey, who's the new talent?
Nancy, this is Eddie.
Is she a member?
After the next initiation.
Give her a preferred position,
I dig her.
Would you two mind letting me in on the double talk?
Ever hear of a census?
Yeah.
If they ever took one at Sherwood,
Eddie would be penciled in as the whole male population, and Eddie's the exclusive property of Birds of Paradise.
We take turns dating him.
What a catch.
That's all there is except on holidays.
We divide him up like a jug of water on a lifeboat.
One swallow to each girl.
Oh, now I get it.
King Farouk with a lawnmower.
Myra, move her way up on the list.
I'll give you a better idea,
Myra, scratch my name off.
Fall off that cloud.
I've got a real boyfriend.
Wow, what a frosty chick.
Well, that just leaves more water in the jug for the rest of us.
Any way you pour it, I'd say you got more jug than water.
Thanks for nothing.
What did I do?
It's what you were willing to do.
I heard you, every word.
Listen, lunkhead, you're not the dream boy you think.
If there was more supply around here, there'd be less demand.
All right, all right.
And don't forget you're engaged to me.
Yeah, but it's a secret.
Not from us.
You know it and I know it, remember that.
Sure, sure baby.
I have to share you, but I don't want you to be so enthusiastic about it.
Okay, okay.
Now give the girl you love a kiss.
Here?
Here.
In the morning?
Does true love look at the clock?
Okay.
And don't forget, cut your date short tonight.
Say your head hurts.
You've been thinking.
And meet me later on at the same place.
Miss Branding, what experiment shall I get ready for today's class?
Two simple experiments combination, the joining of simple solutions to form a more complex compound, and decomposition, breaking down the compound.
You remember, copper wires to form a copper oxide, and then we'll decompose hydrogen peroxide to form water.
Yes, I got my thesis back again.
I'm sorry, Miss Branding.
Save your sympathy and try to learn something from this.
We live in a world ruled by men for men.
He won't even consider my thesis.
He mocked me, my work, but they're convinced that they're on the right track.
And before they're proven wrong and I can do that, they'll destroy the world through reckless experiments.
But you yourself, you experiment all the time.
Of course I do, constantly.
I'm not against progress, but they search for power in the wrong place.
If they continue, do you realize what the people of the future will be, what they'll look like?
Monsters, grotesque, misshapen, frightening fiends.
Isotopes and fallout in our lungs and our glands distorting natural shape and proportion.
No one can calculate the hazards of radiation.
Reckless fools, they search in the wrong place.
When I can demonstrate that there's a power strong enough to destroy the world buried within each of us, if only we could unleash it.
But how?
I can release a destructive power in a human being that would make the split atom seem like a blessing.
And after I've done that, after I've demonstrated clearly that there's more terrible power in us than man can create, scientists will give up their destructive experiments.
They'll stop testing nuclear bombs.
Nations will stop looking for new artificial weapons, because the natural ones, we, the human race, will be too terrible to arouse.
War will no longer be a calculated risk, because it can only end in total destruction.
Oh, it sounds big, Miss
Branding, important.
Oh, if I could help.
No, you won't do, Myra.
For my experiment, I must find a special kind of girl with special potentials.
No, you're not what I need.
I must find someone with the natural fire, explosiveness close to the surface, a disturbed girl perhaps, but with a will of her own, someone...
Wait till you meet our new girl, Nancy Perkins.
She's an A-bomb all by herself.
In fact, each of you in your own chemical makeup contains elements which if isolated and let loose, could blow up the entire school.
But when these dangerous elements are combined, we have a bouquet of very pretty girls.
Myra, will you conduct the next experiment?
I'll need two girls,
Nola and Nancy.
Both of you please come up.
So, you're the new girl, Nancy.
Yes, Miss Branding.
Well, you're the guinea pig.
You're on your own.
Here are two colorless liquids, one is water, the other alcohol.
We will see which one of evaporates first.
Ah, Nola, please extend your right hand, palm down.
Go ahead, Nancy.
That's cold, it feels real cool.
All right, Nola, you do the same thing to Nancy.
You burned me!
Here, here, here, Nancy!
Easy, Nancy, you must control yourself.
A mistake's been made.
On purpose!
Better let me treat this for you.
Myra, will you look after the class?
Yes, Miss Branding.
I think Nancy needs special treatment.
Sorry, Nancy, but accidents will happen.
I still say it was no accident.
You feel strongly about being hurt.
I never forget a hurt, and I never forget the person who hurts me.
Is it better?
No, it still hurts.
Maybe it won't get better.
Perhaps it can't get better until you do something about it.
Like what?
Like what you intimated by getting even.
Maybe.
You needn't be ashamed or afraid of that impulse.
For some people, special people, no injury gets better until the score has been evened.
I certainly feel that way.
So did our ancestors.
You remember the Bible, an eye for an eye?
Then it's all right to feel the way I do?
Yes, under certain conditions.
Well, I feel that way about my father for remarrying so soon.
I hate my step-mother.
I even hate this school because all...
I understand, dear.
Bruised emotions don't heal easily, sometimes never.
All quite normal, as I said, under certain conditions.
What conditions?
I'll tell you sometime when we get to know each other better.
Soon?
Perhaps and when you're prepared to do something about it.
It would be silly for you to strike out blindly, don't you think?
Yes.
Whatever you do should be done under guidance.
But whose?
I'll tell you that too.
Soon?
Perhaps soon.
It still hurts.
Well, now I'll really take the pain away, but I'll need your cooperation.
Well, what do you want me to do?
First I want you to answer a question.
All right.
Nancy, do you trust me?
I think so.
I hardly trust anyone except, well, Glenn, that's my boyfriend, and of course, I did trust my mother, but you, I think so.
I'm glad, because if you didn't,
I couldn't help you at all, and because you do, I naturally trust you.
In other words, what happens in this room must not go beyond this room.
You can depend on me.
What do you want me to do?
I'll tell you.
Nancy, have you ever been hypnotized?
No, not really.
Oh, some goon tried it on me once in a parlor game at a party and I made believe that I was under his influence, and then he told me to kiss him hard, but I slapped him hard instead.
Well, this is not a parlor game, nor is it make-believe.
And take my word for it, Nancy.
This will help you in many, many ways.
You see this amulet?
I picked it up in an antique shop.
It was sold to the dealer by a woman whose ancestors had immigrated from the Carpathian Mountains.
She claimed that it had been in her family for seven generations.
She must've made up the story to get a bigger price.
No, she didn't, Nancy.
She told the truth.
I made a trip to that region to verify this amulet and the legend connected with it.
It's a strange metal with a cat's eye for a centerpiece.
It can heal and it can destroy.
Also it can release frightening powers.
Look at it, Nancy, look at it.
Now, go to sleep.
Your eyes are getting drowsy.
You're getting more and more sleepy, but you can still hear my voice.
You can hear me and you will obey me.
You're in a deep sleep, and your hand no longer feels the pain.
Touch it, pinch it, do as I tell you.
I want you to prove it to yourself.
It's all gone.
And that's what I promised you, and I helped take the pain away, and you won't forget that.
No, Miss Branding.
When I count to five, you'll wake up refreshed, the pain entirely gone, but you'll remember that it's important to obey me always.
One, two, three, four, five.
Wake up.
How do you feel, Nancy?
Fine, I feel fine, it's gone.
Now you can go to your next class.
Thank you.
And remember, not a word of this.
You can trust me, Miss
Branding and thank you again.
Now, remember you guys, this is no panty raid.
We know how to socialize.
We've gotta behave.
Like little gentlemen.
Sure, just like you said, good, clean, fun.
We'll just be a welcome surprise.
Well, I hope so, because
I still don't know if I'm doing the right thing.
Come on, Eddie, make the move, and don't forget, Tab,
I get dibs on the blond.
Which blond?
Any blond.
Only if there's a redhead for me.
Hold this, will you, Joe, come on.
Honey, you're holding me too tight.
But I like it.
Well, of all the...
Don't be scared, girls, it's only us.
My buddies, Joe and Tab.
Hi.
They fell in on me, they're from Lindbergh High, and I was telling them...
Who invited you?
We heard the rock and roll, figured it was open house.
Well, that's out of bounds except for girls.
You'll get us all in trouble.
No, you can't crash this party.
We already did.
So you might as well be sociable.
Besides, it'll be more fun.
Terry, did you invite them.
I just happened to mention to Eddie that we were gonna hold an initiation party and...
What's the difference?
Let's have a blast.
Then we'll go quietly out the window.
Well, all right, but I'm gonna hold you responsible.
Okay, it's all in fun.
Come on, I brought some swinging records.
How about a replacement for that pillow?
No thanks.
Oh, the sociable type.
I choose my own partners.
Okay, but wait till you ask me to dance.
Hey, Tab, how about singing
Puppy Love for the girls?
Come on, sing, Tab, sing.
Come on, Tab.
# Oh, it was quite a night and it sure was hot #
# I had my daddy's car with the convertible top #
# We drove by the light of the moon above #
# And my baby said, oh yeah, let's make some puppy love #
# She looked at me and smiled so sweet #
# But I felt like jumping right out of my seat #
# I knew what she was thinking of #
# 'Cause her eyes said come on, let's make some puppy love #
# Well, then she gave me that crazy look #
# And before I knew it,
I was really shook #
# So I drove like mad and
I didn't stop #
# 'Cause I that if I did,
I might blow my top #
# So I drove her home
'cause it was late #
# And asked her for another date #
# She said, that's real cool, my turtle dove #
# We'll take another ride and make some puppy love #
# Well, then she gave me that crazy look #
# And before I knew it,
I was really shook #
# So, I drove like mad and
I didn't stop #
# 'Cause I knew that if I did, I might blow my top #
# So, I drove her home
'cause it was late #
# And asked her for another date #
# She said, that's real cool, my turtle dove #
# We'll take another ride and make some puppy love #
# Making puppy love, puppy love, love #
Excuse me.
Okay.
What's wrong, Nancy?
Nothing, I just feel a little dizzy, that's all.
It's the excitement of the party.
Sit this dance out and relax.
Tab, I'd like to dance the next dance with you.
Okay.
Look, baby, you're with me.
Knock it off, Joe.
We dance, so what?
Ow, Tab, stop it.
Shh, stop that.
Cut it out, fellas!
Come on, let's get out of here.
Hurry up, hurry up.
Open the door and let me in.
Okay, let her in.
What's going on in there?
What's going on in here?
Why is this door locked?
I thought I heard men's voices.
Oh no, Miss Rivers, I was just doing imitations.
And this place looks as though you had a ballroom brawl.
Oh, we've just been having a little pillow fight.
And what were the pillows stuffed with?
Well, the high jinks are over for the night.
Rules are rules and it's after 10 o'clock.
Oh, just a little longer, Miss
Rivers, just a few minutes.
Well, 15 minutes and then all lights out.
And Nola, you better get supplies for tomorrow's class now.
I know you sleepyhead.
You'll never be up on time.
Oh, I'm always the patsy.
Oh, wait till I get my hands on your Eddie.
Okay, kids, start straightening up.
Feel any better, Nancy?
I'm just sleepy that's all.
I think I'll sack in.
Do that, you cut out now.
We'll clean up.
Goodnight.
Here Nola, take one for the road.
86 proof ginger ale.
All right, the rest of you stay here and help me clean up.
Nobody goes to sleep until this room is shipshape.
The Birds of Paradise are noisy, but neat.
Who's there?
Mrs. Thorndyke, I'd like to talk to all the girls who attended the initiation last night.
Sergeant, you certainly don't suspect one of them?
Routine, but you know how teenagers are.
Sometimes they get carried away, lose their heads.
Well, I suppose you must.
If you don't mind, I'll have them brought down.
Miss Branding, will you please go to dormitories D and E.
Wake up the girls and tell them to come down to my office.
Yes, Mrs. Thorndyke.
I think we could save a little time if you answer a few questions now.
Of course.
What do you keep in that basement?
School supplies and tools.
Who goes down there?
Mostly William, the janitor, occasionally a student.
Oh, the janitor's been with us over 15 years.
Does he keep the basement locked up?
No, it's usually open.
Just the supply room is kept locked.
We'd like to have a talk with the janitor.
Well, I'll get him right away.
Wake up, everybody, come on, wake up, girls, wake up!
There's been a terrible accident.
Hurry, put on your robes.
Meet me outside of Mrs.
Thorndyke's office.
The police want to question you.
Police, what kind of an accident?
When they talk to you, just tell them the truth.
Now, hurry, you mustn't keep them waiting, come on now.
Nancy, Nancy, wake up, wake up,
Nancy!
Can you imagine her sleeping through all this?
You go ahead.
I'll get Nancy up.
Wake up, Nancy, wake up.
Come on, Nancy, wake up.
You've had a long sleep.
I know, I feel, I feel as though I've been drugged.
But it did you a world of good.
How pretty you are after the night, look.
I must've dreamed something weird, Miss Branding.
Perhaps you can explain it,
I dreamed I...
Forget it now.
You can tell me about it later when we're alone, but for anyone else, forget it.
The night belongs to you.
It's your private domain.
No one shall intrude.
As far as the outside world's concerned, forget it.
Do you understand?
I understand, Miss Branding, and I'll forget it.
Nancy, I have something to tell you.
The janitor found Nola early this morning in the supply room.
She was dead.
Remember now, you had nothing to do with it, you understand?
I understand.
The police are here and will question all of you in Mrs. Thorndyke's office about the initiation.
Would you sign this, Lieutenant?
Yeah.
Thank you.
I read the report, Doc.
I get the frame, but there's not clear picture.
What do you make of it?
Only what I saw.
Well, what?
Two tiny punctures of the external jugular vein, right side.
Any blood?
No, that's the strange part.
No evidence of bleeding.
And what is even stranger, not much blood left inside.
Well, now come off it, Doc.
I've never known you to overdramatize.
I'm only reporting what showed on the surface diagnosis.
Face and hands ghastly pale as if the blood had been drained completely.
Oh, I'm sure the P.M. will verify that.
I'd say so.
That's just how the body looked, Lieutenant.
A shame a beautiful young girl like that.
Mind if I say something?
Go ahead, what's on your mind?
This type of murder is part of a pattern.
You know anything about this pattern?
I believe so.
At Med School, I shared a room with an exchange student from a small town on the
Carpathian Mountains.
He used to tell us stories, legends about vampires,
Dracula's.
He told them as though he believed them.
As though he'd seen the monsters with his own eyes.
He explained it as an old world sickness that drives the killer on and on.
He described it so vividly, the pictures never left me, and when I saw that young girl, chalk white, the last drop of blood drained from her, it came back to me, the killer, the sickness, the victims, just as he described it to me, as though it were true, and Dracula.
Oh, come off it, Mike.
You must be kidding.
Don't let anyone hear you talk like that, or you'll end up in a straight jacket.
Okay, make fun of it if you like, but I believe it.
One crack like that out of you to the reporters, and we'll have mass hysteria.
While I'm in charge here, we're not reviving the age of witches and grave robbers.
I'm sorry, Mike, but we've all gotta watch ourselves very carefully.
One wrong word could have the effect of dropping an A-bomb on Sherwood.
As it is, the teenage students are panicked.
Look, I understand your position, but.
Now, Mike, a good coroner has not only got to be a good physician and surgeon, he's got to understand the legal principles of evidence and proof in court.
That's why we can't go around shooting our mouth off making loose assertions.
What you just said couldn't be proved.
For the present, we'll call this youthful zeal on your part, but from here on in, you just follow instructions.
Shocking.
I agree, Mr. Mayther, but I'm doing all I can to keep the girls calm.
In 36 years, it's the first black mark against The Sherwood School, awful.
I think the school should be allowed the same constitutional rights as an individual.
Let's say that Sherwood
School is innocent until proven guilty of negligence.
I'm thinking of the reaction of the board.
First thing they'll do is to cut down on the state grant of funds for your school.
They're businessmen before they're educators.
They won't support a hotbed of scandal and terror.
They may even close
Sherwood all together.
Well, how would that help?
How would that solve anything?
I don't know, but authorities act that way.
What about the girl's parents?
They're circus performers in Europe on a tour.
A lawyer in Chicago handled her tuition and checked her school reports.
They've been notified.
Perhaps the police will find the murderer before they get here.
In the meantime, we must do everything possible to keep all the other parents at bay.
Well, you speak of parents as if they were enemies.
That's the only way to think of them.
Why do they send their teenage daughters to a boarding school away from home, would you?
You'd be surprised how vicious those parents can get.
When they leave their daughters in a private school, they also leave all their responsibilities.
For what they pay, little or much, they expect you to be mother, father, policeman, minister, teacher, guardian, confidant, and friend.
Mrs. Thorndyke, I know your record.
I know your qualifications.
I know how hard you worked to maintain high standards at Sherwood.
Believe me, I haven't changed my opinion of you or this school.
It's just the outside world that concerns me.
Just keep a strong hand on the situation, and let me know of any developments.
I'll try to keep the board from tearing you apart.
Girls, before we take up today's first experiment,
I've been asked by Mrs. Thorndyke to say a few words to you.
I know we're all dreadfully upset by the tragedy that took place.
A death of a teenage girl is a terrible thing under any circumstances.
The unfortunate way it happened here is shocking, shattering, but we must try to put it out of our minds.
We don't help by brooding or neglecting our studies.
Let's remember that the proper authorities are handling this case.
That's their job.
Our job is to concentrate on our studies.
The living have an obligation to go on living.
Now, for our experiment this morning, we'll observe the results when a substance is changed from one physical state to another.
Myra, will you set up the proper apparatus?
Come in.
Here are the corrected test papers, Miss Branding.
I see you're doing more work on your thesis.
Yes, I'm revising it, important revisions.
Then you found some new material?
Yes, science constantly moves forward.
Every hour brings new discoveries.
Your own?
My own, otherwise what I have to give to the world would have no validity.
If my thesis is to make the correct impact on mankind, it must be based on what
I see with my own eyes.
And what you do with your own hands.
Exactly.
I see.
Myra, look at me.
I said look at me.
Myra, I've spent many extra hours training you for a scientific career.
In those hours we've worked closely together.
I've confided in you about my thesis, what it means to me, what it can mean to the world.
Yes, Miss Branding.
That confidence must never be violated.
Never.
Looks like we've run into a wall.
That's about it, Lieutenant.
Every lead we had blew up.
Well, we've questioned a few prowlers and vagrants.
One screwball even wanted to sign a confession.
When we checked he had an airtight alibi.
I've still got a wino in the tank, but I don't think he's...
No, I checked your report on him.
There's nothing there, better drop it.
Every time we corral a new suspect it leaks out to the press.
The mess gets stirred up, but we give them no results.
All they want is results.
Has Doc Lawson got any ideas?
You know how cautious he is.
Won't make a statement until it can stand up in court.
Says could even be an animal.
Shall I close it out?
How long have we been on it, two weeks?
Yeah, and a few days.
No, better just mark time on it.
Sometimes gotta show up.
All right, kids, kids, listen!
Here are the rules for our
Halloween scavenger hunt.
Early today I buried six objects in the old cemetery.
In a cemetery?
Yes, we have to prove our bravery, don't we?
Anyway, the first one to bring back three of those objects wins this crazy compact, complete with rhinestones and trick mirror, donated by Terry.
Hey yeah, but where do we look?
We can't dig up the whole cemetery and by night yet.
No, I'm going to give you a clue.
Now, you find the first object where the moon shines most bright, you will find an object white.
I know where to look.
Well, then I'll follow you.
You can pass the shovels now.
When I say go, you light out fast.
It's 8:20 now.
Your time limit is one hour.
Everybody be back here by 9:20, go!
Look, baby, why here?
I like this atmosphere.
Terry, will you level with me, why here?
Silly, I told you.
I'm on a scavenger hunt.
What do you have to bring back, a body?
No, we just have to dig up some objects.
Well, count me out.
Will you stop shivering.
The kids often date here.
Tab and I thought we were gonna go to a Halloween party.
But a scavenger hunt in the cemetery.
No, I've had it.
I'm cutting out.
Nancy, what did you do to your, why Nancy, what's come over you?
I can't find anything here.
Nancy, did you.
Hi, well, there's that cold fish from the party.
Still the social type.
Come here, honey.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
You're pretty strong.
Okay, I didn't say anything.
I'm leaving right now.
Never come across anyone quite like you.
Can't be, get away from me!
Get away from me!
No, get away from me!
Now we have three murders all alike.
Must be the work of the same killer.
What do you make of it, Doc?
Go along with you this far.
The symptoms are identical.
Two incisions of the jugular vein.
Well, is the killer human or animal?
Well, I can't commit myself yet.
You shut me up fast the first time, but I tell ya, this second killing fits in with what I was trying to tell you.
Look, according to you we oughta start a witch hunt.
Search for a Dracula.
Search only in the moonlight.
Protect all possible victims with garlic leaves, or maybe dig up a couple rows of corpses, and drive wooden stakes through their hearts so they'll stay buried.
Isn't that what the legend prescribes?
You can't laugh away murder.
I'm not trying to.
I don't intend to.
But the way it happened, where it happened.
Look, let's go about this in a logical routine manner.
Now, what was the motive?
Well, it's not robbery.
No evidence of assault, and it doesn't seem like vengeance.
These teenagers had no enemies.
Well, none that we know of that is.
Then it's definitely the work of a paranoid.
Somebody with a compulsion neurosis to kill.
In my book that means another attempt will be made.
The psychopathic killer feels superhuman.
He thinks of himself as above...
Why himself, there were certainly no clues pointing to the sex of the killer.
That's right.
Maybe within the school itself.
We better requestion every girl on that scavenger hunt.
If necessary, every girl in the school.
The Lieutenant will see you now,
Nancy.
Go ahead, dear.
Come in.
Sit down, Nancy.
Now, we know you wanna tell us the truth, and this lie detector will help us to evaluate your answers.
The polygraph pens don't lie.
Now, Nancy, to set your mind at ease, let me explain how the polygraph works.
These wires carry an impulse to the machine which registers through the pens on this graph paper.
The pens move according to the impulses they receive from your body.
That way we obtain a picture to whether your statements are true or false.
Start the machine, will you?
Example, Nancy, what's your full name?
Nancy Perkins.
The pen registered a normal impulse.
That indicates you told the truth.
Now, I want you to tell me a lie.
What's your full name?
Eleanor Banks.
There, see the difference in the sweep of the pens?
That indicates you didn't tell the truth.
That's all there is to it.
Now, let's get down to business.
How old are you, Nancy?
How long have you been attending The Sherwood School?
Oh, about six weeks.
Do you like the school?
Yes.
Now, tell us in your own words as best you can, exactly what you did on
Halloween night.
Well, we were told to look for six objects in the old cemetery, and each of us was given a small spade to dig with.
Did you find anything?
Not at first, I...
Well, go ahead.
Tell us how you went about the scavenger hunt.
I was trying to find the first object.
Yes?
And then I saw Terry lying on the ground, and next to her was Tab.
Did you see anyone strike either of them?
No, sir.
Did you touch either of them?
No, no sir.
What happened after you saw both bodies?
Well, the other girls came running, and they saw the bodies too, and we just stood there.
All of us just stood there.
We were too frightened to move.
Thank you, Nancy.
That'll be all.
Well, the polygraph indicates you told the truth.
Can I take the girls back to school now, Lieutenant?
Yes, and thank you very much.
That's an interesting necklace, especially the pendant.
An antique, I suppose?
It's definitely an antique.
I'm not the type for costume jewelry.
It's a keepsake of no value at all, except me.
I can see you treasure it very highly by the strong chain you wear it on.
Do you also wanna question the teachers?
Yes, but we'll let you know when.
Goodbye and thanks again.
Come in.
Nancy.
Miss Branding, I'm frightened.
You've got to help me.
You must tell me, Miss
Branding, who, who am I?
What am I doing?
I'm living a nightmare.
A horrible urge comes over me.
I feel a strength that's almost frightening.
It takes possession of me.
I must do something awful, but when I try to remember all I can see is you.
I've got to know, Miss Branding.
You will and when you know the whole truth, when you realize the part that you've played in saving mankind from his own destruction, you'll be proud.
But in the meantime, what I do, what you make me do, I feel it's wrong.
Wrong, who's the judge of that?
There's as much merit to one side as to the other.
The final result will justify everything.
Go back to class.
Empty your mind of doubts or misgivings.
Remember the deed and the responsibility are mine.
Your responsibility, like master and slave?
Like brain and arm.
Put it out of your mind.
Go on, Nancy.
Go back to class.
I came as soon as I got your message.
Thank you, Miss Branding.
Oh, I need your help desperately, and I know I can trust you.
I'm also trying to control my nerves, but it is extremely difficult.
You see, you might say that
Sherwood School is under bombardment.
Everything I've worked for, built up with love and patience, being destroyed because, because of these dreadful tragedies.
A dozen students have been pulled out of school by parents and guardians in the last two days, and the state supervisor threatens to close Sherwood.
I know how you feel, Mrs.
Thorndyke.
Please call on me, anything
I can do, anything.
Thank you, Miss Branding.
Now, I want you to take over some of my administrative duties, which will leave me free to talk to parents, to reporters, to keep down hysteria until the police catch this fiend, this monstrous killer.
Of course, of course.
As long as I have a chance
I must keep on fighting to save the school.
I'll help in any way I can.
Myra, come in.
I came as soon as soon as I got your note, Miss Branding.
Mrs. Thorndyke wants me to take over some of her administrative duties, so I won't have time for class.
I want you to substitute for me tomorrow.
Just review what we've studied so far and correct all the papers.
Yes, Miss Branding.
Are you experimenting on your own again?
Yes, I had to check some details.
When you transform power from one substance to another, from a lower sphere to a higher sphere you have to be sure.
Goodnight, dear, I know you'll make a good substitute.
But I'll never be the teacher you are, Miss Branding, goodnight.
Goodnight.
Nancy.
Oh, Glenn.
I'm sorry if I frightened you, baby, but I've been waiting here for hours.
What're you doing here?
Well, I had to see you.
I borrowed dad's car and I cut two classes and made the 300 miles in less than six hours.
Aren't you glad to see me?
Nancy, are you all right?
All the papers are full of scare headlines about Sherwood School and with this fiend running loose,
I was nearly out of my mind worrying about you.
I just had to see you.
I'm all right, Glenn,
I'm perfectly all right.
How would I know that?
One letter from you the first week, and then after that you stopped writing.
Nobody crams that much.
Nancy, is there anything wrong?
No, of course not.
I mean between us.
No, Glenn.
Let's go someplace where we can talk, Nancy.
I tried to see you earlier, but I couldn't get by a
Miss Branding.
She's a real creep.
She said no visitors allowed.
I asked her what're you running here a dungeon, and she practically tossed me out.
Because of what happened they're very strict that's all.
Where can we go, Nancy?
I don't know, Glenn.
I don't know any place that's safe.
Well, let's just go and sit in the car.
We have to talk.
I've gotta get this thing straightened out.
No, Glenn, you mustn't.
What am I all of a sudden, poison?
Not even one kiss?
Please, Glenn, you said you wanted to talk.
All right, we'll talk first.
Look, Nancy, I'm sick, I'm worried sick about you, about both of us.
All those wonderful plans we made, going to state college together, then after that the other plans.
Kids make plans, dream stuff.
You meant every word you said.
I know I did.
But the way you act and speak tonight, I've lost my compass.
I don't know where we're heading.
Look, I'm gonna ask you once more.
Is there anything wrong?
Maybe.
Nancy, please, what're you trying to say to me?
I don't know, Glenn.
I don't know for sure, and until I do you must go back, please.
I won't.
Now, do as I tell you!
Go back before it's too late!
Nancy!
Miss Branding.
What is it, Nancy?
Miss Branding, you must help me.
Well, I thought I convinced you I am helping you.
No, I don't mean those fancy phrases about mankind and the future of the human race.
I mean help for me.
You've got to set me free.
Free to do what?
Free to be myself.
I just left Glen, my boyfriend.
You tried to stop him from seeing me.
I didn't think that was important.
It's the only important thing in my life.
I love him.
I know that.
That's why I tried to prevent him from seeing you.
Nancy, I can't risk having you upset.
At this point of my experiment, our experiment, your emotional stability is of the utmost importance.
In the scale of the future is bigger than anything.
Certainly bigger than adolescent love between a couple of teenagers.
What I feel for Glenn you'll never understand.
I'm asking you to set me free.
Don't confuse me any longer with this talk of a big experiment.
I know what you are, and I know what you've done to me!
When I was in his arms instead of feeling what I should,
I almost killed him.
You've got to help me.
It's too late, Nancy.
We, you and I together, we must go to the end of this experience.
But it's horrible what
I do, what I become.
Power, especially the power to kill is never pretty.
It won't go on much longer.
In time you'll be proud of the part you've played in saving mankind.
Here drink this.
It'll make you forget.
You'll do as I say, remember what I want you to remember, and draw a veil over the rest!
No!
Nancy, look at me!
No!
I said look at me!
I won't, if you won't let me go, I'll do it myself!
You can't defy me.
My will is stronger than yours.
Get away from me, get away, please!
Nancy, open the door!
Nancy, are you in there?
Open the door, Miss Branding!
Open the door.
Miss Branding!
Oh, Nancy.
Oh, Mrs. Thorndyke, we're too late.
I should've told you sooner.
Even her manuscript is gone, destroyed, years of work, the record of her experiment, gone.
As it should be.
There is a power greater than science that rules the earth, and those who twist and pervert knowledge for evil only work out their own destruction.
I'll call the police.
One more.
Just one more, please, Dr. Meacham.
Hold it, please.
A little closer to the wing, sir.
A little more profile, Dr. Meacham.
Yeah, he wants to get that faraway, visionary look.
Cal, we know how tired you must be.
We'll make it as short as possible.
Fire away, gentlemen.
But I warn you,
I am beginning to feel faraway and visionary.
How about your conference with the Committee on Atomic Power?
Oh, not my conference.
20 engineers and scientists were there.
Hardly a routine meeting, would you say?
Yeah, and look, Cal, we won't buy the committee's getting you VIPs together for a cocktail party.
All right, boys, I'll tell you this much.
Under discussion was the biggest job we've ever tackled, the industrial application of atomic energy.
But that's not news, Cal.
We all know there've been several industrial reactors in work already.
Well, let us say then that, in the light of recent developments, those plants may already be obsolescent.
Electronics is your specialty.
How does that fit in with atomic energy?
You boys like to call this a push-button age.
It isn't, not yet.
Not until we can team up atomic energy with electronics.
Then we'll have the horses as well as the cart.
How long has the Army been handing out jets, Doctor?
One of the boys at
Lockheed handed me this one.
I hope you taxpayers don't mind.
Cal, when do we get to this push-button age?
When fellows like me stop talking about it and get back to our labs.
I'll see you gentlemen later.
- Goodbye.
- So long.
Cal.
Cal, are you working on anything along the lines you mentioned?
Roughly.
Well, remember me, will you?
I'm concentrating on the re-conversion of certain common elements into nuclear energy sources.
Huh?
How's that again?
What counts is how I make it work.
I see.
Have a good flight, Cal.
Thank you.
So long.
2XD341, calling
Ryberg Control Tower, come in.
2XD341, this is Ryberg Control Tower.
Go ahead.
Okay to come in, Webb?
All clear, Cal.
The drift's south, about 20 miles per hour.
Hi, Webb.
What's Cal's ETA?
Half an hour late.
That's my boss.
The only guy in the world who can travel by jet and still be late.
So you talk about me when I'm gone.
Where are you?
Look out the window.
Cal, what's wrong?
I have no control.
Cut loose, Cal.
Bail out!
I can't.
I'm too low.
Jerking around must have caused a flame out.
No power.
No nothing.
Cal, you okay?
Okay.
What happened?
How'd you bring it in?
I didn't.
Couldn't.
What do you mean, you didn't?
Controls went out.
Huh?
That's right, no controls, no power.
The plane died up there.
I should be dead...
Cal, I know everybody's seeing flying saucers and screwy lights up in the sky.
Well, you can put me in the booby hatch, too, because, so help me,
I saw this ship turn a bright green up there.
Are you sure, Joe?
Positive.
Did you hear anything?
Yes.
A high-frequency howl.
Very high.
All the time your ship was...
Green?
Did Webb see it?
Unless he's blind.
Check him.
Right.
Oh, and, Joe, until we find out what happened, all three of us were blind.
How's the little giant?
Growing up.
Getting ready to astound the world.
Let's take a look.
I figured that.
She's all ready and waiting.
Lowering the cylinder.
Increase the rate of reaction.
Check rate of radioactive decay.
Positive.
The same it was the whole week you were away.
What did the committee say?
Oh, they were a little excited.
A little?
Zero reading.
The XC condenser must have shorted out again.
Get the spare.
Burned out yesterday.
And don't ask me why I didn't order some new ones.
I did.
XC condensers in an envelope?
Must be a gag dreamed up by the receiving department.
I ordered two XC condensers, and Supreme Equipment sent me these beads.
You say they're a gag, but they're condensers.
I checked one for capacity and voltage on the meter.
And blew it to bits.
Yeah.
After it held to 33,000 volts and no leakage.
If that were true, we could build a generator.
One that would supply electric power to run an entire factory.
It would fit in a matchbox.
It still read 33,000 volts.
I'll try one on voltage test.
I've got one set up for you.
Into thin air.
35,000 volts.
Call Pete Knowles at Supreme.
Okay.
Pete Knowles, please.
Pete?
Cal Meacham.
I ordered two XC condensers and you sent me some beads.
Yes, beads.
Well, I am serious.
I just tested one bead for voltage and...
Oh?
Well, thanks.
Supreme didn't send them.
They're crazy.
Pete says they've had no condenser order from us in six weeks.
Here's the duplicate of the order
I sent by teletype three days ago.
What's the address on the letterhead that came with the beads?
No address.
Look.
"Dear Dr. Meacham,
"In place of the condensers you ordered,
"we are sending you our AB-619 model.
"We are certain it will interest you.
"Director, Electronic Service, Unit 16."
I thought it was a subsection of Supreme.
Electronic Service, Unit 16.
Well, at least we can find out what they're made of.
A diamond drill, the hardest element we've got.
The bead isn't even scratched.
Experimental lab, Wilson speaking.
Yeah, sure.
Sam wants to talk to you.
He's at the hangar, he's been checking over the plane.
Good.
Hello, Sam.
Sam can't find anything wrong.
Did you double check the controls?
Of course not, I, now, look here, Sam.
All right, Sam, you win.
Maybe I did have just a couple, but, all right.
Good night.
Maybe I should have had a couple.
Maybe I will.
Morning.
Sign here.
Thank you.
What have you got?
I don't know.
There's no return address.
Electronics Service, Unit Number 16.
A catherimine tube with an endiom complex of plus four.
What are they talking about?
I don't know, but this outfit has them.
This isn't paper.
It's some kind of metal.
"Interocitor incorporating planetary generator.
"Interocitor with Volterator.
"With Astrascope."
Here's something my wife could use in the house, an "Interocitor incorporating an electron sorter."
Although she'd probably gain 20 pounds while it did all the work for her.
You know, Joe, according to this, there's no limit to what it can do.
Laying a four-lane highway at the rate of a mile a minute would be a cinch.
Cal, maybe we've been working too hard.
"Complete line of Interocitor parts,
"incorporating greater advances
"than hitherto known in the field of electronics."
What exactly is an Interocitor?
I don't know.
And I don't want to know.
Well, I do.
I want to know what it is and what it does.
Order the list of parts on these pages.
How are we gonna build it?
These symbols, they're like a foreign language.
And anyway, we don't know the address.
Well, you ordered the condensers from Supreme by teletype.
Yeah?
Which means that somebody intercepted that order and sent us those beads.
Here, try it again.
You're too darn smart.
I may be the dumbest man who ever walked this Earth, Joe.
Here's the invoice.
No charge and no address.
And listen to this,
"No Interocitor part can be replaced.
"Bear this in mind while assembling."
Well, let's start unpacking.
There's 2,486 parts.
Each part is cross-indexed into a symbol pattern.
Shouldn't be too hard at all.
Sure.
A snap, maestro.
Only, where do we start?
Right here.
You know what my kids would say.
Dig this crazy, mixed-up plumbing!
Plug it in, Joe.
We'll see what happens.
Now what do I do?
Clear your screen, please.
You can hear me?
Of course.
Use the intensifier disk.
The one in your hand.
Place it in position on your right.
Now turn the control
18 degrees to the left.
You have successfully accomplished your task, Dr. Meacham.
You've assembled an Interocitor, a feat of which few men are capable.
Who are you?
I'm called Exeter.
I'm a scientist like yourself
Shall we say, a colleague.
My colleagues don't materialize out of strange machines.
They're flesh and blood.
And so am I, Dr. Meacham, as I hope you'll soon find out.
Although I admit at the moment, I do appear immaterial.
But no matter.
I represent a group which is seeking scientists of exceptional ability.
All prospects must pass an aptitude test, which you've just done.
I'm flattered.
Only I don't remember applying for any job.
You didn't.
I beg your pardon, Mr. Wilson.
Your camera will pick up nothing but black fog.
Images on the Interocitor don't register on film.
Put it away, Joe.
To continue, Dr. Meacham, we test out people without their knowledge.
We leave nothing to chance.
Except the chance that I'm not interested in you or your group.
Come, come, Doctor, it's not possible that a man of your scientific curiosity wouldn't want to find out who I am, where I come from.
Wouldn't give his right arm for more examples of our superior technical knowledge.
I think I can assume, Dr. Meacham, that you're sufficiently intrigued to come to an immediate decision.
We'd like you to join our team, as you might say, at once.
You'll make arrangements to leave immediately.
Wait a moment.
I didn't say...
At five o'clock Wednesday morning our plane will land at your field.
It will wait exactly five minutes and then depart.
Whether I'm aboard or not?
Place the catalog on that table with the blueprints.
Now stand aside, please.
You too, Mr. Wilson.
Just a minute.
Please step back or you maybe harmed.
Further back.
You okay?
Okay, within reason.
If there is any reason around here.
There's no reading now.
Cal.
Yes, Joe?
Whatever that Exeter is, I don't like it.
Don't you, Joe?
He was right about one thing.
I'm gonna be on that plane.
Cal, won't you reconsider?
I did, all night.
And as a committee of one,
I came to a series of decisions at exactly the fifth cup of coffee.
One, whatever scientific knowledge this Exeter character has should be in our textbooks.
Two, Joe Wilson, my able assistant, knows enough about a certain experiment to carry on without me for a while.
I'm not sure of that, Cal.
Look, Joe, my committee decided I'm expendable.
Nothing you can say will change that.
You always were an obstinate, oh, well, I'm not worried.
Not even a moth equipped with a lightning bug could fly in here this morning, so no plane is...
He made it.
No pilot.
No windows.
Cal, you'll really be flying blind.
Please be seated, Dr. Meacham.
And welcome aboard.
A seat belt is not required, Doctor.
Please clear the stairs.
Thank you.
So long, Joe.
I'll be dropping you a card.
Cal, get off, right away!
This whole thing smells to high heaven!
Cal, I'm begging you!
Don't go!
Please, don't go!
Good morning, Dr. Meacham.
Hope you slept well.
We'll be landing shortly.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Where am I?
Georgia.
I kind of expected Neptune or Mars.
Exeter asked me to greet you.
I'm Dr. Ruth Adams.
Ruth Adams!
But this is wonderful!
I never expected,
Ruth, I'm Cal Meacham.
Cal.
Dr. Meacham, of course.
Four or five years ago, conference on thermal problems in nuclear reactors.
Boston, wasn't it?
Vermont.
We were lecturing to a symposium of graduate students.
Summer, three years ago.
After classes we'd go swimming in a little river near the school.
You were an awful sissy about that icy water.
Oh, Ruth, don't tell me you've forgotten.
Dr. Meacham, all I can say is I'm deeply flattered, and maybe a little envious of the girl you've mistaken me for.
And now I think Exeter is waiting to greet you.
I'm sure you must be puzzled, Doctor.
I'll never forget my own feelings on the day of my arrival.
Exeter isn't exactly conventional in his hiring methods.
Or his choice of personnel.
I think that sounds like rather a personal dig.
Once you're at the club,
I'm sure you'll like us much better.
The club?
That's what we like to call it.
Exeter has spared nothing for our comfort or facilities for our work.
Inside looks better, Doctor.
They'll bring your bags in.
Your plane.
The elevators down to
Exeter's slave quarters.
Our laboratories.
Our living room, social center, library.
This is Exeter's office and study.
Not exactly what you expected, Dr. Meacham, is it?
Good morning, Doctor.
Good morning, Doctors.
Give me your coat.
Good morning, Herr doctor.
Good morning.
Engelborg, from Munich.
The Doctor's out for his morning constitutional.
He's been here a week, but his English and my German...
Who's that one?
That's Brack, one of
Exeter's assistants.
But you'll find them all very helpful.
What language do they speak?
Anything you wish.
English, Hindustani, Congolese.
Anything.
Dr. Meacham.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Please come in.
Both of you.
Sit down.
Dr. Adams.
Oh, yes, Steve.
About that nuclear decay factor, Ruth,
I'm afraid my equation just doesn't seem to work.
I was hoping you could find time to go over it with me later.
I still think the basic principle is all right.
And maybe we can trust...
Yes, well, thank you, Dr. Adams.
Oh, there you are, Dr. Adams.
I was just reminding Dr. Meacham that I had promised to produce some of his colleagues in the flesh.
May I use you as my exhibit A?
I'm afraid Dr. Meacham isn't too happy with me.
At the airport, he was sure we were old friends.
Obviously I was wrong.
The lady hardly remembers me.
What is more important is...
Who we are, what we're doing here.
Dr. Meacham,
I represent a group of scientists who work with but one purpose, to put an end to war.
Naturally, such a goal can't be attained without experts of superior ability, men of vision.
Men such as you, Doctor, gathered here, exchanging information daily, putting aside all thoughts of personal success.
We hope to achieve exciting new techniques, leap years ahead of the others.
I don't think I need tell you how effective our voices will be when the world learns of our achievements.
Well, there you have it.
Nothing new, perhaps, but then, what is?
However, let me assure you, Doctor, that we are dedicated men and women, and as such we can accomplish wonders.
Well?
What do you think of us?
This all sounds great,
Mr. Exeter, but why me?
Dr. Meacham, we happen to know that you are on the threshold of discovering limitless amounts of free nuclear energy.
More specifically, the conversion of lead into uranium.
Dr. Adams here has been working along the same lines as you have.
Perhaps just a step behind you.
Although I might add that both of you are way ahead of anyone else in your field.
Be careful.
Exeter will flatter you to death.
The truth is never flattering, Dr. Adams.
Now, suppose you relax and think it over.
Suppose when I do, I find
I can't go along with you?
Naturally, we'll expect you to be discreet about what you've seen here.
Otherwise, you are free to leave, Dr. Meacham.
As free as air.
And now, suppose we continue your tour of inspection, right from our chairs.
Conserving energy is one of our primary concerns, isn't it, Doctor?
Your laboratory, Doctor.
Immediately below this office, I believe.
Still under construction, but, in a few days, well, we'll have some surprises for you.
Brack?
Everything in order?
Yes.
Thank you, Brack.
Any reason why you can't start in the morning, Doctor?
No.
Another view of your laboratory, with your own Interocitor, of course.
In addition to which, we hope to provide you with...
One of our other units calling, Doctor.
Other units?
Yes, we have several at strategic points throughout the world.
Please forgive me.
We'll have a chat at dinner, Meacham.
Excellent cuisine, by the way.
Like everybody here, the chef must be dedicated to his work.
You'll find the stairway through the living room and to your right.
Your room is at the top of the stairs.
Thanks.
Dr. Meacham.
I'm still sorry I wasn't the girl in Vermont.
Yes?
Your progress report
I find is unsatisfactory.
You are failing to meet the schedule as planned.
Why?
Because certain methods imposed upon me by the council have not been effective here.
I wish to discuss it with the council.
Impossible.
The time element will not permit any dissenting opinions.
You will carry on with
Plan A as instructed.
Now, please report on status of personnel.
With the arrival of Meacham, the personnel roster is complete.
Proceed with Plan A.
What do you think of Mr. Mozart, Exeter?
I'm afraid I don't know the gentleman.
My mind must have been wandering.
Your composer, of course.
Our composer?
He belongs to the world.
Yes, indeed.
The dinner, Exeter, was even more perfect than you promised.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I could do with some fresh air myself.
Would you care to join me, Dr. Adams?
You, Dr. Carlson?
Why don't you?
Show him the grounds.
We won't start cracking the whip on Meacham until tomorrow.
That's quite a group
Exeter has collected.
Quite.
That's Dr. Hu Ling Tang.
Tang's field is titanium, the same as Dr. Engelborg.
Dr. Marie Pitchener, U-235.
Dr. Blorfield, plutonium.
Hmm, that puts all of us in the production of nuclear energy, doesn't it, Carlson?
What are you getting at, Meacham?
Why no biochemists?
Electronic experts, mechanical engineers?
People equipped to make practical application of the energy the rest of us produce.
I seem to remember that was part of Exeter's pitch.
We try to make it a rule around here, Doctor, not to discuss our work after hours.
Now, how about that fresh air?
How about you and Dr. Adams showing me my laboratory instead?
After all I've heard today,
I can hardly wait to add my little contribution to the good work.
This way, Doctor.
Your lab and my lab are in this wing.
Steve and the others are on the right.
This is yours, over here.
It's only Neutron.
We call him that because he's so positive.
Stay off Dr. Meacham's equipment.
Well, what do you think of it?
It's not bad.
Should be able to get started very quickly.
Fine, but a word of warning.
Don't let Exeter push you too hard.
He's the kind of man who wants results yesterday.
This is the same size lead slab I use in my own lab.
I guess you're right.
I guess Exeter doesn't expect me to waste any time.
This is very interesting.
Now, standing here with the lead slab in front of us, the lead reactor panel behind us, we're shielded from nuclear rays.
Could be even from the prying eyes of Exeter's Interocitor.
What's your opinion, Doctors?
All right, I'll spell it out for you.
The two of you walk around here as if you're scared of your own shadows.
Ruth's even afraid to admit she and I once might have held hands.
Well, that's okay with me.
But either I've got to figure I'm a little cracked, or that Exeter's cat has got both your tongues.
You ever stop to think that we have a right to throw a few questions at you, Meacham?
What are you doing here?
Look, I received a darn fool catalog.
I couldn't resist it.
I built an Interocitor, arrived on that trick plane and that's all I know.
But so help me, in the next 10 minutes,
I'm gonna know a lot more.
I believe him, Steve.
Well, I guess I do, too.
Now we're getting somewhere.
To begin with, Cal,
I was the girl in Vermont.
Then why all of that...
Because we couldn't take a chance.
There's always the possibility you spent a few minutes under one of Exeter's sun lamps before you got here.
Sun lamp?
That's what it looks like.
Only instead of a sun tan, you get your brain cells rearranged.
Steve had a peek at one.
Yeah, it's similar to a lobotomy.
Renders useless certain areas of the brain.
Those areas controlling the power of the will.
Up until now, Steve and I have been spared.
We think Engelborg, too, but we haven't the slightest idea why.
And what about the others?
Try talking to them.
Well, that leaves the big one.
Who's Exeter working for?
We don't know.
All we do know is what you've already guessed.
Exeter is desperately trying to come up with new sources of atomic energy.
And we're the geniuses he's depending upon to deliver for him.
Well, he might get a surprise.
Why did you wait, Brack?
You should have told me.
I was busy elsewhere.
If you're so concerned, why don't you let me use the transformer?
The transformer is not the only answer.
The council differs.
It says it's infallible.
The council is wrong.
I told the Monitor so today.
The transformer is morally abhorrent to the subjects.
It sets up subconscious blocks which defeat our very purposes.
You're being sentimental.
I am being practical!
No, Brack.
Use a machine to control a man's brain, you destroy his initiative.
You destroy his power to help us, as we need help.
We can both see it right here.
It maybe true, but are you sure?
We're 30 miles from nowhere.
Steve and I know, we've tried.
And if we did get out, who'd believe all this?
I don't blame you doctors for being excited about working for Exeter.
It's a rare privilege.
He's a rare man.
Our little Neutron gave us away.
He felt the impulses.
That cat, I could...
Put Neutron under the thought transformer?
Why not, Brack?
And perhaps you'd like me to step in with him.
Turn it off, Brack.
Our friends won't be giving us any more information tonight.
And the log of 236 plus
1.008 to the ninth.
It's an interesting equation.
I'll check it.
You may find it'll help you over some of the more difficult obstacles, Meacham.
And now, Doctor, I'd like to acquaint you with another of our accomplishments.
Notice that section of lead plate behind you.
Please bring it forward, about eight feet.
Now, please move back.
By the door, Doctor.
When your lead-to-uranium process is working properly, the effectiveness of this ray will be increased enormously.
Tell me, Exeter, why should a communication device be equipped with a destructive ray?
Television waves can't penetrate mountains.
With the aid of neutrino rays, we can.
Neutrino rays?
You've just observed one in action.
I suppose the neutrino could be described as the missing link between energy and matter.
Fascinating, if destruction is our goal.
On the contrary.
Just recently, one of our rays was used for quite another purpose.
More specifically, to save your life.
The green light?
Exactly.
Picking your plane up in midair and conveying it safely to Earth.
After it first immobilized my controls.
Meacham, I must ask you to have faith in our ultimate aims.
I must also ask you to refrain from meeting with any of your co-workers again, except in our usual channels.
Any way you want it.
Very good, Doctor.
And your patience, I promise you, will be rewarded.
Here's a sketch of the Interocitor.
I also have rough notes on its working controls.
It's guesswork, mostly, but better than nothing.
And these are portraits of Exeter and Brack.
Do you notice the peculiar indentations in both their foreheads?
Coincidental, no doubt.
And this is the one we're really proud of, Cal.
We discovered this about a week ago, two miles south of here.
The side of this hill has been hollowed out.
And here's an acre of canvas covering the excavation.
You tell me what's in there.
Steve wanted to go back and find out what was inside, but I guess I got cold feet.
Just like Vermont, still a sissy.
They're fine, Steve.
When we get out of here,
I'll have them framed at my own expense.
If we get out.
He's just hungry.
Goodbye, Neutron.
Confirm, please.
Plan A abandoned.
Alternate plan in effect.
Correct.
Our ionization layer is failing rapidly.
We may need transportation.
Are you prepared to leave?
We have been since your last communication.
Although Meacham and Adams are achieving positive results.
Can you give us another time period?
Impossible, but it is hoped that you will be able to complete the project here.
Bring them.
Good.
You will keep in contact until moment of departure, then remove all evidence of installation.
That is all.
Take over.
What is it?
Something I've seen before.
Get off the road, quick!
They're playing with us.
We're sitting ducks in this thing.
If we're gonna make the airport, we'll have to do it on foot.
When I stop, we'll pile out.
Take cover, fast.
Steve!
Steve!
We've got to get out of here.
Get down!
Get away!
We'll try and make the airport.
Let's go.
Is it flyable?
It should be.
Exeter keeps it here for the staff.
They're pulling us up.
Remain here.
I want a report on temperature control immediately, and use extreme caution through the thermal barrier.
Our two passengers are very sensitive to heat.
The passengers are here.
Allow me to welcome you.
I'm sorry that our visit below had to be terminated so dramatically, but time allowed for nothing else.
I can assure you, we mean you no harm.
Like Steve Carlson and Engelborg?
Like the others in that house?
What happened was beyond my control.
What happened was mass murder.
We're not all masters of our souls, Meacham.
That's a nice little phrase, coming from you.
I learned it on Earth.
Look, the two of you are beginning a strange journey.
A journey that no Earth people have ever undertaken before.
Now, whether you consider me a devil or a saint is unimportant.
What is important is that you're here on this spaceship.
Suppose then, for the time being, we call a truce.
As scientists at least, Meacham.
Ruth, don't tell me that as a woman you're not curious about our destination.
Where are we going?
To a planet we call Metaluna.
Metaluna?
There's no such planet in the solar system.
Metaluna lies far beyond your solar system, in outer space.
The Stellar Scope will convince you.
Come.
Observer, prepare a view of the second quadrant, please.
I won't ask you to condone what we've done.
All I ask is that, when you understand the plight of my people, you try to have more sympathy for our deeds.
Earth.
It's being left far behind.
Cal, it's getting hard to breathe.
We're going through the thermal barrier.
I'm afraid you'll find the temperature unpleasant for a short time.
Prepare to leave Earth's orbit.
All conversion must be completed during this time period.
Follow me, if you will.
Exeter, what are you using for power?
How are you controlling the fantastic temperature on this ship?
What's to prevent us from floating around like a bunch of balloons once we get away from Earth's gravity?
Well, to answer the last question first.
We create our own gravitational field, which means that no matter what position our ship takes in space, we here inside remain right-side-up.
But, at the moment, if we're going to get you to Metaluna alive, there's a little procedure you'll have to go through.
What are you doing to them?
Metaluna's atmospheric pressure is like that in your greatest oceans.
If we entered Metaluna's orbit without conversion, we'd be crushed to death.
Then in going from Metaluna to Earth, the tissues of our bodies would dwindle.
We'd disintegrate completely.
Correct, Meacham.
If we're fortunate enough to return to Earth.
Brack!
Yes?
You will prepare the doctors for the tubes.
You'll change into clothes such as ours, especially conditioned for life on Metaluna.
Come with me.
Place your hands above the rails.
They're magnetized.
There's an intercom system in the tubes.
You may converse as long as you're able to.
Ruth?
Yes?
You okay?
And you?
Feel like a new toothbrush.
Ruth.
Cal.
Approaching enemy-control sector.
This is Master Control awaiting instructions.
We'll energize only as necessary.
Conserve power.
Avoid contact with enemy until safety of ship is in danger.
You'll feel stronger in a few moments.
Now, I know you both feel as though you could sleep for at least 1,000 years, but then you would miss observing our approach to Metaluna.
And with your curiosity, you'd never forgive me for that.
I don't understand.
What don't you understand, Doctor?
Those two objects, they appear to be comets, but their paths are identical, almost as though some intelligence were controlling them.
Your deduction is quite correct, Doctor.
Although the objects are not comets, they're meteors controlled by spacecraft of Zagon.
They're gonna hit us, they're gonna hit us!
We've offered to make peace with Zagon, but to no avail.
Is Zagon a planet?
A planet that was once a comet, as you can see.
Their spacecraft are actually guiding the meteors against us.
Now on fourth quadrant.
Metaluna contact in three time periods.
Observer, a closer view.
View in third quadrant.
Contact in two time periods.
View in second quadrant.
Contact in one time period.
View in first quadrant at ionization layer.
What you're observing may well be the beginning of the end for our world.
The Zagon meteors are beginning to get through our ionized layer.
That haze, a field of intense radiation.
As you can well imagine, such a screen requires the output of great amounts of atomic energy.
And you're running out, that's why you were sent to Earth.
And why you sent for us.
You need uranium.
In gigantic quantities.
Our own deposits are exhausted.
As our power diminishes, our protection fails.
That's enough, normal view.
Entering ionized layer.
Metaluna.
Brack, remove the equipment of our two doctors to turbine center.
Have it all set up for immediate use.
Oh, Brack, I'm sure personnel will need everyone.
Have the crew report immediately for reassignment.
Now, we must report to the Monitor.
Step in.
Our means of interior transportation.
Before the war forced us to move inside of our planet, these tubes covered the surface of our Earth.
Our educational complexes.
Now, rubble.
Over there was a recreation center.
This way.
The Monitor's structure.
Welcome, Exeter.
Observed your flight.
Almost counted you lost.
Your Earth creatures.
Dr. Adams.
Dr. Meacham.
The Monitor, the supreme head of our government.
Regrettable, there is no time for amenities.
I am certain your minds have difficulty grasping this transition from Earth to Metaluna.
I have given them as much indoctrination as possible.
Then you know that shortly we can expect Zagon to commence and sustain an all-out attack.
Our ionization layer must be maintained until our relocation is effected.
Relocation?
To where?
To your Earth.
A peaceful relocation.
We hope to live in harmony with the citizens of your Earth.
In harmony?
Our knowledge and weapons would make us your superiors, naturally.
Then why haven't your superior brains solved the problem of synthesizing uranium?
Most of our scientists are dead.
Our major laboratories, destroyed.
The war has reduced our population to a mere handful.
That is true, Meacham.
It is indeed typical that you Earth people refuse to believe in the superiority of any world but your own.
Children looking into a magnifying glass, imagining the image you see is the image of your true size.
Our true size is the size of our God.
Do you still insist, Exeter, that we can allow any of these Earth creatures to have free minds?
I do.
I know them.
I have lived with them.
You have wasted our time.
Take them to the thought-transference chamber.
Please come with me,
I'm afraid you have no choice.
Interocitor control, hear me. lonization failing at prime sector.
Use emergency power and repel attack.
Power transfer will begin immediately.
Our Zagon friends seem to be hitting this prime sector quite regularly.
Is that where it is, in there?
My mind is my own and nobody's gonna change it.
I'm not going into that room.
Nobody is, come on.
I'm sorry.
I'd hoped to have prepared you somewhat beforehand.
This is a mutant.
We've been breeding them here for ages to do menial work.
Well, actually, they're similar to some of the insect life on your own planet, larger, of course, with a higher degree of intelligence.
This one has been given orders to guard this corridor as long as we're here.
I beg of you, go inside, cooperate voluntarily.
If you do, I give you my word that you will not be harmed or your minds changed in any way.
You'd defy the Monitor?
I already have.
Do you believe him, Cal?
In this place, I wouldn't believe my grandmother.
Come on.
The travel cart, come on!
Where are we going?
The spaceship, at least it's safer there.
Don't you understand?
Let it happen now.
Meacham!
Ruth!
Stand back, Exeter.
Meacham, believe me, I wanna help you.
Time is short.
Get into the car.
He appears badly hurt.
Stay close to me.
Stand back.
I command you, stand back!
Cal!
Are you badly hurt?
I'll be all right.
Close off all hatches.
Control room, quick.
I'm all right.
Ruth, activate the Stellar Scope, right control, 45 degrees left.
Our ionization layer has failed completely.
Will we be able to get out?
Depends on the amount of energy we have left.
If we have to ward off any heavy Zagon attacks,
I don't know.
That may be the last of them.
Yes.
They're concentrating all their attention on Metaluna.
Those flashes of light, they're meteors, hundreds of them.
The intense heat is turning
Metaluna into a radioactive sun.
The temperature must be thousands of degrees by now.
A lifeless planet.
And yet, yet still serving a useful purpose, I hope.
Yes, a sun.
Warming the surface of some other world.
Giving light to those who may need it.
Now, into the converter tubes.
Ruth, you take the first tube.
You, the next.
What about you?
I'll use the third tube.
Exeter, are these tubes strong enough to keep him out?
Possibly, he's bleeding badly.
In a very few moments, the pressure should destroy him.
Run, Ruth, run!
Our speed is diminishing.
We're now in the atmosphere of Earth.
Your plane is where you left it, in the cargo hold.
A conventional way for you to return to Earth, I admit, but perhaps the most practical.
Where are you going?
Our universe is vast, full of wonders.
I'll explore, perhaps find another Metaluna.
A place inhabited by beings not unlike myself.
You see, I'm more adventurous than you imagined me.
Exeter, you're a liar.
You've used all your power bringing us here.
Even if you had a place to go, you couldn't make it.
Come with us.
We'll heal your wounds.
I'm afraid my wounds can never be healed.
You've things to teach us.
Thank you.
We're over your Earth now.
It's time for you to go.
Farewell.
Home.
Thank God, it's still here.
I was here this afternoon.
He wasn't here then.
He's alive.
Go back and get a litter.
Better hurry, we still have a good deal of ground to cover.
My name is Girard, I'm a doctor.
We are about a thousand miles off the coast of Peru.
How do you feel?
I guess all right.
- Any pain?
- No.
Good.
Did your ship go down?
Yeah.
Pedro Queen.
It was a freighter.
Your name is William Fitzgerald, hm?
We found a wallet in your hip pocket.
It's over there on the table.
You are petroleum engineer, eh?
Yeah.
- You were headed for the states?
Yeah.
Isn't there anybody?
You were alone.
There was an explosion.
I was the only, only one up on top, I.
I thought there might be other boats.
No.
Your lifeboat was the only one washed up on the beach.
Do you have you any boats here?
No.
Have they radioed?
We have no radio.
I'm afraid there's nothing we can do.
Well.
You sitting up and taking notice, eh?
Walter, this is William Fitzgerald.
Walter Perrera, we carried you off from the beach.
And did you see anything?
- No, that thing's really hurting, you know it?
I heard it once.
Moaning, crying like.
You really want that thing back?
Don't be stupid, Walter.
We must've woke your wife up.
She's up on the porch.
Well, I'll see you all in the morning.
Glad you're okay, Fitzgerald.
Good night.
Go in there and stay with him until he finishes it.
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry.
How long have you been up?
- I think I woke up when you first brought him in.
Is he all right?
He will be.
He was on a freighter that went down.
He's an American, apparently the only survivor from what he says.
- There isn't anything you can do about the others, is there?
Walter said that you found him on the beach.
Yes, he was quite lucky.
He could have drifted into the-
When?
And hour ago.
What were you doing out?
It has escaped again, hasn't it?
Going to dig pits tomorrow.
I knew it, I heard it crying.
It sounded like a human.
There is nothing to be afraid of, dear.
It's as frightened of you as you are of it.
Yes, I suppose it is.
It's known nothing but pain and fear since we came here.
I can't help being afraid.
I'm afraid of this house, this island.
I can't stand Walter.
What you're doing is so wrong, I hate it, all of it.
I know you do.
Please let the animal go.
Let it escape, then we can leave here.
Frances, we have spent two years working on that animal here.
It would be absurd to throw that away and the dozen years before that learning, experimenting.
That's important.
- What about us, aren't we important?
My dear, of course we are.
Please don't.
This is so cheap.
- There's just no talking to you tonight, is there?
Good night.
Sir, are you feeling all right, sir?
Yeah.
Feeling a little bit like a human being again.
I was just thinking, I'm a pretty lucky human.
Yes, sir.
Can I do something for you, sir?
No, I'm fine, Tiago, thanks.
I think that was about the finest meal I've ever had.
And I thank you for the razor and the clothes.
Did Dr. Girard say when he'll be back?
No, sir.
Flowers for your girl?
They're for my mother, sir.
I take them now if you don't want something.
No, I'm fine, thanks.
Tiago, is there anybody in the house now?
No, sir.
- Well, there was something about traps last night, is he hunting today?
Yes sir, he's hunting.
Tiago.
Who lives here, Tiago?
- Dr. Girard, Mrs. Girard,
Mr. Walter, my sister.
I mean here, on this island.
What people live here?
Not any, sir.
- Not any?
- Nobody.
Hello.
Hello?
Anybody around?
Hi, no, don't come any closer.
Stay there.
It's all right, I didn't want you to walk into this pit.
There's a pit here.
It begins about a dozen feet in front of me.
It's covered with leaves and branches, do you see it?
How do you feel?
Pretty good.
What is this, a trap?
Yes, we're just about finished.
Just a little over there, then you're through.
Mr. Fitzgerald, this is my wife, Frances.
Hello.
How do you do?
I'm glad you're feeling so much better.
- Yes, I've been thinking about that, I'm pretty lucky.
- You shouldn't be running around like this, but as long as you are here, it's all right.
Can I help?
No, thanks.
Are there any more pits like this?
Three more.
Did you have anything to eat?
Plenty, Tiago's a good man.
I'm sorry there wasn't one of us there, but we had to get this done.
It's been a very difficult day.
- Is it a particular kind of animal you want?
Yes, uh, we dug those pits and we put out some drugged meat.
One or the other ought to do the job.
It's all right, let's go.
The sun will be down in an hour.
I must've slept for 20 hours.
That's good, you needed it.
I guess I did.
Feels as if I'm not awake yet.
- To you, darling, for many reasons.
The most immediate being our delightful supper.
- I think we should be toasting Mr. Fitzgerald for reminding us we still can be civilized on vacation.
- That's right, Mr.
Fitzgerald is our first guest.
Seems so much longer than two years.
I had forgotten we had goo china or silver or the manners to use them.
- I'd like to drink to destiny or the fates, or whatever it was that put me ashore here on your island.
I'm gonna walk around a little.
It's been two or three hours now.
We might've caught us a cat by now.
Yeah, I'll get that black devil back where he belongs.
Ain't that right?
- Yes, sir.
- You can bring a coffee now, Selene, just three.
This has been wonderful.
I'd almost forgotten about the animal, this island.
- This here's been a very pleasant evening.
You've been here two years?
Just about.
- At first, I had the idea that you were a missionary, but the boy was telling me you've, well there's nobody else here on the island.
This would be a very poor spot for missionaries.
No, I am a surgeon.
I'm doing some experimental work here.
You must've come through the village this afternoon.
Yes.
Well, didn't Tiago tell you?
About the village?
- Well, it has been inhabited since last night.
50 or 75 people were living here.
What do you mean, they all just left?
Not quite so sudden or so strange.
They're very superstitious people.
They never quite understood what I was doing here.
They thought me to be some sort of an evil spirit.
We've had some trouble before.
Must be a primitive bunch.
Well, most people are, aren't there?
Wouldn't have been much different in New York.
What did they do?
Nothing, they were afraid, so they decided to move to some other island.
Why were they afraid?
No reason really, they were just afraid.
- One of the men came to get Tiago and Selene.
We didn't know until later, but they wanted to stay on.
They're the only ones left.
Well that's fantastic.
All while I was asleep.
Why, we all were asleep.
Is New York your home, you mentioned it.
- Yes, I had my practice there in Manhattan.
I gave it up two years ago.
I was doing quite well, office on Park Avenue.
I quit because I was making too much money.
Not that objected to make money, but I had some research work I wanted to do, and the more money I made, the harder I found it to break away.
I knew if I waited much longer, I'd never leave.
What is it you're trying to do?
To alter certain functions.
It's too difficult to explain.
It would be to me.
Surgery's a little out of my line.
You are from San Francisco.
Mm, that's right.
I've been in South America most of the last 10 years.
I was on my way back home to stay.
I didn't quite make it.
It was a terrible thing.
I'll be a long time forgetting.
Incidentally, how often does a boat put in here?
That's what I wanted to tell you.
Not very often, I'm afraid, about four times a year.
The last was seen a month ago, so could be another two months.
Do you realize nobody in the world knows what happened to that ship or the people on it, and nobody knows what happened to me, except you.
Charles.
Maybe just a signal.
Sounded close.
I won't be long.
Is it always quiet like this?
Not always.
- I think I'm developing a taste for quietness in my later years.
I like it.
- You do?
I don't.
Sometimes, not always.
Are you afraid of something, Mrs. Girard?
I'm afraid of everything.
Right now, the darkness and the night.
I never used to be afraid of the darkness before.
But I am now.
- I don't blame you, the animals here, it surprises me.
What do you mean?
I just wouldn't expect to find anything like a panther here, not on an island the size of this one.
Do you see many of them?
No.
No, we brought this animal with us when we came here.
Charles got it from a dealer in Kahai.
It's for his work?
Yes.
It escaped last night.
They'll probably find it, won't they?
Yes, they'll find it.
Then he'll want me to assist him in his work again.
I don't think I can.
Do you work with him?
I'm a nurse.
Well, I don't know,
I imagine he's as anxious to get back home as you are.
I'm going to leave on the next boat whether Charles's work is finished or not.
I'd like to get away.
Sometimes I think I'll die on this island.
Will you help me, Mr. Fitzgerald?
Certainly, but.
Looks like they got him.
- Yeah.
I have to go in now.
See, nothing to be afraid of now.
Yes, there is.
Well, we got him.
He eat enough of that meat, he'll be out this time next year.
- Walter, there's no reason to keep you up, you can go to bed.
Frances.
Frances, will you come out now?
Charles, please don't.
Leave him alone tonight.
- There are some sterilized gowns downstairs, aren't there?
Yes, there are.
I'll be down.
- You want to fill all them pits tomorrow, don't you?
Yes, tomorrow.
- All right.
- You got him.
Yes.
Are you going to be working tonight?
Yes, he's unconscious.
There was more chlorohydrate in that meat that would put out an army.
We have to bring him to, otherwise, he'll die.
I didn't realize he'd escaped.
Your wife told me you used him in your work.
He is my work.
- Well, I think I feel as if I've been making myself.
I think I'll go to bed.
Yes, you're still very weak.
It will take a few more days.
Dr. Girard.
I know this work is important to you, and I also know that the whole things is none of my business, but-
Yes, this work is very important to me.
It's the most important thing in my life.
I came here to do a very specific piece of work.
I came to this island because it afforded me privacy.
There is no one here to waste my time.
I understand.
Good night.
No change.
No.
Must be the generator.
Will you please go and turn it?
Yes.
It's more than half full.
It must be something else.
I cannot stop to check now.
The candles must be over there in the top drawer if we need them.
Let's hope we don't.
Are you operating tonight?
No, not tonight.
You now, this is wrong.
I can't help you anymore, I can't.
All right.
I'll have Walter come down and clean up.
All right.
I'm sorry.
Hello.
Your own private beach.
Yes.
Sometimes it's a little too private.
How do you feel today?
Fine, been exploring your island.
Say, I was wondering, I just passed through the village, and I meant to ask last night about the graves there.
Was one of the boys' mothers Tiago's?
Yes.
She was our servant.
Her name was Alicia.
She was killed the first time the animal escaped.
She was the first one.
The night before last, it escaped again.
People were killed that time.
That was why they left.
Your husband didn't say anything about it.
No.
I, I guess he had his reasons.
Last night you said you were afraid.
You never said what you were afraid of.
Is it your husband?
Yes.
Will you help me?
I said I would.
But I don't think there's anything to worry about.
They're not going to let it get loose again.
Must be a mean animal.
It's a pitiful creature.
Don't let's talk about it.
- Don't you feel better today than you did last night?
- I always feel better on a daylight, out in the sun.
- Along the Gulf of Mexico, there's a little beach, something like this.
- I was imagining this was a
French Riviera before you came.
Have you ever been there?
- No.
- It's pretty overrated.
- I thought I'd love it when I first came here.
Seems a long time ago, two years.
I was busy making plans, and I was planning to marry a wealthy doctor, live on an island in the South Seas.
Sounds better than a travel poster.
I thought so then.
It's been a long time, hasn't it?
Please don't.
I'm not lonely, I'm frightened.
Won't be long.
I'd hate to see them come.
Remember last year?
Yes.
Would you like a drink?
No thank you.
You sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
- Mrs. Girard, will the doctor not be having his dinner?
- No, if he wants anything, he'll get it himself, Tiago.
- He hasn't been upstairs the whole day, you know it.
I'll call down to him a couple of time.
He said he was busy.
That's all right with me.
Maybe that stinkin' animal down there is gonna die.
You want another one?
Not yet, thanks.
You gentlemen have your drinks.
I think I'll say good night.
- Already?
- Good night.
Good night, Mrs. Girard.
She's kinda touchy tonight, ain't she?
She's a little edgy.
I guess we all are.
- Yeah, yeah, everybody's touchy, are they?
That's right, I hadn't thought about it.
But uh, you know why that is, hm?
No, why?
It's the weather.
That's right, that's the weather.
I know what I was talking about,
I was born and raised in rain country, in Guatemala, you know.
Over there, when it rains, or it's gonna rain, people gonna get mean, you know?
Irritated, it's the weather.
Same thing here.
Makes sense.
Imagine scientists-
- Scientists, hm!
Let me tell you something, friend.
I have enough science to last me the rest of my life.
I work around in hospitals, in nuthouses, since I was 23 back home.
And let me tell you, that Girard's worse than the rest of them put together.
What do you mean?
Oh well, nothin'.
It's my own fault for coming down to this stinkin' island.
You know,
I thought I was gonna have it pretty soft down here.
There it is.
I'm going off to bed.
I could though, I could tell you some things.
A lot of them, I mean, right here.
- You could, huh?
- Yeah.
Stinkin' rain.
There's nothing to say, is there?
I thought you decided that my work was none of your business.
So I did.
You like a fresh drink?
I see you are interested in what I'm doing here.
I wonder why.
Just curious.
I wish I weren't.
Now.
You'll find out anyway from
Walter or Tiago or my wife.
Haven't they told you what I was doing?
No, they didn't.
They made quite a point of not telling me.
They don't approve, I'm afraid.
I wish they understood, but they don't.
Every man needs approval, understanding.
Do you know anything about surgery,
Mr. Fitzgerald, medicine?
Well, a couple of years ago,
I got into a fight at a bar in Caracas, and they took 12 stitches, that's about the extent of my knowledge about surgery.
That's one of its functions, repairing damage to the human body, removing malignant or poorly functioning organs, transplanting tissue or bone from one part of the body to another, sometimes from one body to another.
Now there's been some progress in plastic work recently, but basically, surgery has remained primitive, limited, its potential not even imagined by medical men.
I can imagine it, though, and surgery's only a part of my work, a small part.
You see on the desk most of it, and these are the records.
Could I have it first hand?
- I feel as if I were
100 years old tonight.
I began thinking about this already in medical school, actually started working on it about 10 or 12 years ago, simple work at first, on smaller animals, skin and bone grafts.
Later, I attempted alterations of major organs.
I had incurred many failures, but there was a percentage that was successful to some degree, so I kept on trying and learning, experimenting.
Try at what?
- To bring about the modification of a species, but a modification to such a degree that the subject will lose the characteristics of its own species and take on those of another.
Do you understand?
I think so.
- I don't mean surface or topographical changes, but basic modifications, do you understand?
- Well, on the face of it, it seems unnatural.
Is that what the others say?
Yes, that's what they say.
It's no more unnatural than evolution, it is evolution.
- And you've speeded up the process, is that it?
You make it sound very simple, it isn't.
There's more to it than surgery.
That's what you said.
You see, surgery can alter appearance, it can change a rat into a rabbit, but the real difference lies in the brain.
Its size and the function of the individual areas.
There is where the change has to be made.
- You can change the size of a brain, cause it to enlarge?
More than that.
Enlarge and actually alter the cellular structure by the use of certain chemical, I developed it, it's a synthetic, it's similar to a glandular extract.
Now, infinitesimal amounts of this chemical injected directly into the brain during surgery will bring about alteration of individual cells, cell division, and cell growth.
I can control the size of the brain.
I can control the function of the various areas.
What do you think?
- I think you've given me something to think about.
- I can alter living matter, alter it basically from its smallest unit to its largest, from one cell to many trillion.
- And that's what the animal out there is for.
Yes, we can talk some more tomorrow.
I still have a great deal of work to do tonight.
All right, good night.
Dr. Girard, the changes in evolution have come about through a process of natural selection haven't they?
Yes.
But in your work, the selection isn't nature's though, it's yours.
Your choice.
Yeah, that's right.
Uh, I'm going to operate tomorrow.
Would you like to come downstairs?
Yes, I would.
- Mr. Fitzgerald, please do not take what my wife says too seriously.
She is afraid, and she doesn't know what she's afraid of.
Rain keeping you awake?
Yes.
Me, too.
Still, there is nothing to be afraid of.
Be still.
Thank you, Tiago.
Yes.
Sir?
- Hm?
I was wanting to ask you.
Will you carry these with you, in your pocket?
Why sure, Tiago.
What is this?
Aku-aku.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
It's hard to believe it rained last night, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
- Would you want some orange juice now, ma'am.
Yes, please.
Good morning, how are you feeling?
I could say that you're not to blame for what happened last night.
- I don't want to talk about it now.
- If I thought it was something to be ashamed of-
Please don't say anything.
Talking just makes it worse.
We'll have to face it sooner or later.
I don't want to talk about it now.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
Good morning.
Just coffee, Tiago, where's Walter?
- Walter had quite a bit of sleeping medicine last night.
Not too much, I hope.
I need him to assist me this morning.
- Are you operating this morning?
Yes.
Say, what is aku-aku?
- I see you must have been talking to Taigo, huh?
Yes, he gave me this.
- Yes, that's an aku-aku, it's a sort of good luck charm.
All the natives here believe in it.
Tiago must think you'll need a little bit of good luck, huh?
Who doesn't?
That's right.
Mr. Fitzgerald and I had a talk last night.
I tried to explain to him what we are doing here.
What you are doing, Charles.
See, my wife does not approve.
You still feel like coming along?
- Sure, right now?
- Yes.
You won't be bothered by his crying for a while,
I'll be going to his larynx.
He'll have no voice?
Only just for a few hours.
You won't change your mind?
No.
Well, I'm going to wake Walter.
Tiago, maybe get him some breakfast.
Shall we start?
- Hm.
You will find it odd to find here in the middle of a jungle a complete laboratory, surgical equipment, even have our own generator, and x-ray machine.
The animal is in here.
You'll be all right for a while.
You will have to help me to get him onto a table.
You take the legs.
Dead weight, a lot of it.
Secure the hand straps, will you?
You operating right now?
Yes, as soon as Walter comes down.
You want to stay?
Yes, I'd like to.
I'm glad you're here.
Later, whether you approve or not, at least you'll believe what you see.
Oh Walter, get yourself cleaned up.
If you'd be so kind to lift this, use the knob.
See, it's always hard to believe great changes unless you've seen all the steps.
At least you have seen one of them.
- You said great changes, what did you mean?
What kind of changes?
Some people would call them miracles.
Would you?
Yes, do you believe in miracles?
I don't know.
I've been around a little,
I haven't seen one yet.
- Yes, you are young and you have been around.
You think you know enough of the world to speculate on its past or its future.
I don't.
I still believe in miracles.
Walter.
I've performed exactly 53 major operations on him in the last two years.
Dr. Girard.
This animal-
Yes, he's terribly strong.
It's ironic that such a little brute should fear me, but he does.
I think you better get out.
I'll wait upstairs.
Hi, Tiago.
You were down for a long time, sir.
Hm, didn't realize it was that late.
Yes, sir.
Five past noon.
You have aku-aku?
Mm-hm, here we are.
You will need it, sir.
Yeah, I might at that.
Just finished, Frances, could
I talk to you for a minute?
I have to help him clean up.
You have any trouble?
No.
- I'll stay here, you can go upstairs and rest.
- I thought you didn't want to come down here anymore.
So did I, but I'm here.
Will you help Mrs. Girard to clean up?
Frances, you check his heart every few minutes, huh?
I'll be back in about an hour.
All right.
I wouldn't get that close, Mrs. Girard.
It's got bit loose once before.
We got him strapped down now.
Just the same, it's no sense letting him get started again.
I don't think he'll hurt me.
Suit yourself.
I'm glad you came down here, Mrs. Girard.
I've been wanting to talk to you about something.
What?
Well, I wanted to talk about you.
What do you mean?
Just to talk.
What do you want, Walter?
I don't want anything.
I sure don't want you to get sore at me.
I want to help you.
I don't need any help.
And if you don't leave, I'm going to call Dr. Girard.
- Oh come on, you're not going to call him.
That's why I didn't want to talk to you earlier.
Any place public, you know.
Like, at the beach.
I really don't blame you none.
After all, it's none of my business.
But you are wrong about not needing any help.
You do, because let me tell you, that husband of yours is crazy.
You counting on getting the next boat off this island.
He just might not let you, you know that?
That Fitzgerald, he ain't gonna help you.
He's helping your husband.
You need somebody on your side.
I really want to help you.
If you will let me.
Stay away from me, Walter.
Let go of me!
You devil.
Got your boyfriend a little upset.
You stop that.
- I want you to forget about this now, Walter.
But don't come close to me again!
Devil being, it's time somebody took you down a peg or two!
Hi.
Hi, Selene.
The doctor up from his nap yet?
He was asleep when I left.
- Yes, sir.
- Thanks.
- Mr. Fitz.
- Yes, Selene?
You, and doctor leave?
Well, I did wanna see him, why?
Mr. Fitz, Mrs. Doctor is a good woman.
You help her to go away, please.
My brother and I go with you.
Only you can help, Mr. Fitz.
I'll do what I can Selene, I promise.
But I thought you and
Tiago wanted to stay here.
Our home is here, but no more.
Nothing now belongs here.
Only dead.
- That's a bad bruise,
Selene, where'd you get that?
It's nothing.
Who did that to you, Selene?
No one.
Perrera?
No.
Ah, there you are, Fitzgerald.
I see it hasn't rained all afternoon.
You've been exploring the island?
Not really, just walking, thinking.
Come into my study,
I have something to show you that might interest you.
Another hot day, eh?
Come in, Mr. Fitzgerald, sit down.
This is what I wanted to show you.
It should make your perspective about my work fairly complete.
Dr. Girard, what kind of animal is that you have downstairs, what do you call it?
What would you call it?
- I don't know, I've been thinking about that.
Ever since I saw the eyes, all I saw was the eyes, but-
And what would you call it?
A man.
Am I wrong?
What is a man, Mr. Fitzgerald?
Where does the species begin?
- I saw his eyes, and there was a soul there.
I call him a man.
Well, if he's a man, if he has a soul,
I gave it to him, didn't I?
I don't think you have the right to.
- Mr. Fitzgerald, I'm a scientist, not a philosopher.
I cannot possibly concern myself with the moral aspects of my work.
There will be enough people who will be only too eager and willing to take care of that when the time comes.
Why do you want to do this, do you know?
Certainly I know, I'm perfectly sane.
I never thought anything else, but I'm still curious to know why.
Well.
Man breeds animals for his own purpose.
Improves them, modifies them, he speeds up the processes of natural evolution.
Now, you could ask why not use the same principle to improve the human race?
Well, it cannot be done,
'cause man's mind is not his own.
It' completely dominated by complexes, anxieties, fear and prejudice of countless generations before him.
That's why I've chosen the animal to be the father of a new race of man.
He alone will have a new, fresh mind capable of thinking his own thoughts with complete objectivity.
I've never known such a man, have you?
- Maybe some day, such a man will evolve, evolve naturally.
There are laws, natural laws.
Yes, but why wait?
We can only find out about these natural laws by waiting, watching, and recording them over hundreds, thousands of years and generations.
What a waste of time.
Let me show you something, Mr. Fitzgerald.
Here, this is a photograph of the animal when we first brought it here.
Here, our sketches showing the various stages of development.
This is evolution, Mr. Fitzgerald.
Man evolved from an animal in less than two years, according to natural law, it cannot be done.
Well, I have done it.
Have you?
In appearance, perhaps, but inside, he's still a beast, a killer.
Semantics.
This creature killed by instinct, out of fear.
Same instinct of fear makes people kill each other, go to war.
That instinct, I'm afraid,
I have not yet been able to isolate and remove with a scalpel.
- In the meantime, he's killed four people without reason.
- How childish and naive and sentimental you are.
What do the lives of four people-
- You mean you don't care about the lives of these people?
- I care as little about theirs as I do about my own.
Well, that's your business, but you don't have the right to involve your wife in all this.
- Mr. Fitzgerald, why should any man value another more than he does himself?
That's your philosophy.
Isn't it yours?
Be honest with yourself.
It takes courage, I know.
Well, I have it, and that is why nothing, absolutely nothing will stop me or alter my course.
So what is your course from here?
I shall continue my work, and I shall succeed in creating a higher, a perfect man.
He's entering another life.
Can you imagine what he feels, what he thinks?
Does he think?
Yes.
Man.
Man.
Man.
Man.
Good.
Good, man.
Good.
Yes, yes.
Yes.
He is a man.
Charles, is he afraid of something?
I don't think so.
I don't know.
I could use this.
I wish I knew what was wrong.
No pain.
There is no pain.
It may have something to do with you.
Why don't you wait outside.
Don't be afraid.
Nothing is going to happen to you.
There's nothing to fear.
Don't be afraid.
What do you want me to do, sir?
Get Walter down here with the torch.
What about you?
Go on.
Get a torch, he needs you down there.
Tiago's gone after it.
Well how good that will do.
The gun was there.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.
What about Charles?
He's okay, Tiago!
Are you out of your minds?
You'll get us all killed!
- He'll be afraid of this sir, do you have a match?
Yeah.
I'll stop him!
Walter.
Careful, Walter.
Please don't hurt him.
You, too!
Somebody help me with this, quick!
He's badly hurt.
I'll give him a sedative.
That devil tore up the whole place down there.
Don't that matter any?
No.
The damage can be repaired, it doesn't matter.
Besides, we have other drug supplies.
- Why, you should've let me finish him off myself.
He's a killer to start with.
- I don't want to hear any more of that.
He's no more of an animal than you are.
Then he is a man.
Is he, Charles?
Yes, he is.
You call that thing a man?
Charles, we have got to get out of here.
Let's talk about it later.
There's no need to talk about it later.
We have no secrets here, any of us.
We live too closely for that.
Yeah.
- Please, let's leave as soon as possible.
I can't.
Then I've got to go by myself.
- I know what a strain this has been on you, Frances, but you are still my wife.
Am I?
What exactly does that mean to you?
I told you how I felt about my work before we were married.
I never said that living with me would be one endless romantic adventure.
Oh Charles, I'm so sick of this.
I'm not trying to put the blame on anyone,
I don't care who's to blame.
All I know is that I can't live here any longer.
I don't even know you.
You don't know me?
Whom do you know, yourself?
Fitzgerald, perhaps?
What do you want me to say, Charles?
There is nothing to say.
We both know how things stand.
Do we?
I supposed you're the injured party, the innocent and misunderstood husband.
Frances, why are we so hostile?
You'll just never understand that whatever I've done here is not for myself, but for humanity.
Did it ever occur to you to ask me if I thought it was worth it?
You'll leave with me when I'm ready.
You'd better accept that as final.
- I'm not like that poor creature downstairs, Charles.
You didn't create me.
He's going back to the lab.
He's gone clean out of his mind, calling that thing a man.
Expect we'll have to do something.
- Like what?
- Like!
Somebody's got to stop him.
He'll get us all killed.
What he is doing, that ain't right, and you know it.
You act like you want him to keep on.
What's the matter with you, anyway?
I think you're as crazy as he is!
Do you think Charles is insane?
He may be a genius, he's not insane.
There's a fine line.
Does somebody got to stop him.
- You're not the one, though,
Walter, even if you're right.
- I don't know what he's fixing to do down there, but I think we ought to do something.
What are you gonna do Walter, get drunk?
You don't talk to me like that, mister.
Oh, please be quiet, Walter.
You two are pretty smart, aren't you?
He don't know how smart, does he?
Get up.
Stay there!
I'm going down there.
I'll have a little talk with you later, mister.
Take it easy, Walter.
- Yeah, take it easy, that thing gets loose again, kill all of us!
- Don't be stupid!
- I'm not stupid, mister!
I'm not stupid.
Girard!
You fool.
Get back, go on.
I'm going to do some operating on him.
Walter, I am warning you.
Get back!
You calling me a fool,
I'll show you the fool!
What's that?
The generator.
You better do something about it, there's not time to lose the lights.
- Downstairs.
- Okay.
Where's some candles?
In my room.
You find it?
No, it should be somewhere downstairs,
I thought they were here.
Oh, here it is.
This thing's dead.
Do you have any matches, a lighter?
No, not in here.
It's all right, Frances.
Nothing to be afraid of now.
We're getting away from here together.
I'll tell him tonight.
I have to leave by myself, I've got to.
- But I love you, Frances, don't you know that?
I don't know anything.
Maybe some people can accept mistakes and make the best of them, not me.
I loved him a long time.
I can't just forget that.
Please leave me alone.
He's still there, in the hall.
You still hear him?
No.
- He's here?
- Yes, Tiago.
- You both all right?
- Yes.
Yeah.
Walter is dead.
- You wanna go after him tonight?
He hasn't been gone long.
If he's close, he might find him even in the dark.
Tiago, get the slickers out of the big closet.
Bring the flashlights and the two coils of rope from the dock.
But how are we going to stop him, how?
I don't know.
- Gotta be crazy to try and look for him in the night.
If I were you, I'd wait till morning.
But you are not me.
Why don't you, instead of hindering me, help me, Mr. Fitzgerald.
That's what I would do if I were you.
All right.
If we find him, how do we take him?
I don't know, exactly.
I'll get the hypodermic kit.
Mister.
I'll take this one-
- Oh no, you stay here, you stay with the women.
Yes, sir.
You have a gun?
Yes, but we won't need it.
We'll be back before long.
Yes.
- Make sure the windows are locked, all of them.
The back door, everything, all the way around.
You take the rooms, Selene.
Yes, ma'am.
Tiago?
Tiago!
Tiago!
Selene?
Where are you?
Tiago?
Tiago?
Selena, Tiago?
She's dead!
Frances!
Frances!
Frances, Frances!
Look in all the rooms, I'll go downstairs.
Frances!
Fitzgerald.
- It came back while we were gone.
It must've gone out the back way.
We've got to find him.
We have to find her, Doctor.
Must've been him.
This goes down the cliff.
You take this way.
We only have one gun between us.
I won't need this, neither will you.
He'll do whatever I tell him to do.
Put her down.
There is nothing to be afraid of.
Don't be afraid.
Put her down!
Put her down!
Come here, come, come here.
Leave him alone, Charles.
Keep away from him!
Come.
Come?
Tiago!
Are you all right?
Where's the boat?
It's gone, sir.
He wanted to help me.
The sun'll be up soon.
IVAN THE TERRIBLE
Part Two
THE BOYAR`S PLOT
Written and Directed by
SERGEI EISENSTEIN
This story about Ivan the Terrible,
the founder of the Tsardom of Muscovy,
tells of his struggle against the foes of Russian unity.
In the role of Ivan the Terrible:
Nikolai Cherkasov
The Oprichniki:
Malyuta Skuratov:
Mikhail Zharov
Alexei Basmanov:
Amvrosy Buchma
His son, Fyodor Basmanov:
Mikhail Kuznetsov
Philip, Metropolitan of Moscow and of all the Russias:
Andrei Abrikosov
Pimen, the Archbishop of Novgorod:
Alexander Mgebrov
Pyotr Volynets:
Vladimir Balashov
Efrosinia Staritskaya, the Tsar's aunt:
Serafima Birman
Her son, Vladimir Staritsky:
Pavel Kadochnikov
Prince Andrei Mikhailovich Kurbsky: 
Mikhail Nazvanov
Sigismund, King of Poland:
Pavel Massalsky
It is the year fifteen hundred and sixty-four,
the year in which the Tsar formed his special bodyguard,
the Oprichniki.
The year in which Tsar lvan withdrew to Alexandrov.
The year in which the people organized a procession
to beg the Tsar to return.
The year in which Prince Kurbsky
committed the base treachery of surrendering
the Russian armies to the Poles
and transferred his allegiance to King Sigismund.
There are certain defeats that are more resounding than victories.
The defeat of my Russian army near Revel will spark off the revolt.
Tsar Ivan has fled the wrath of the boyars and taken refuge in Alexandrov.
The Moscow boyars, the Kolychevs, have managed to get some messages through.
The Tsar is assailed on every side like a baited bear.
The boyars are seething with revolt, the Tsar will fall without a blow being struck, and the throne of Moscow will be free for a new Tsar well-disposed towards Poland.
God in his wisdom decreed that Lithuania, Poland and the Baltic States should serve as the outposts of Europe, in order that the civilized nations of the West might be protected from the Muscovite barbarians.
They say the Muscovites eat children alive.
Russian soil is fertile.
The herds are well-fed.
The sub-soil conceals inexhaustible riches.
Of course, the Russians have to be kept down, but a strong man on the throne of Moscow would shatter the most cherished dreams of all the European sovereigns.
We need the dim-witted Vladimir Staritsky.
We must support the rebel boyars.
The solitary reins of absolute power must be wrenched from the Tsar and returned to the feudal princes.
We must destroy the unity of Ivan's Russia.
Once that has been done, the Christian kings will embark on a new crusade.
We will force the Muscovite to serve the West.
We will drive the Russians out of Europe and force them back to their Asian steppes.
Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!
Tsar Ivan is on his way back to Moscow!
So I've caught you!
You didn't expect me back, eh?
You were delighted by the Tsar's departure!
You've shown yourselves for what you are, traitors!
The rogues.
They wanted to govern the land themselves!
Alright, if that's what you want!
From now I'll give you land to govern!
I'll give you land.
But as the widower,
I shall keep the widower's portion... the towns along our borders.
From there
I will watch over the security of the State and guard the integrity of Russian frontiers.
And I shall stamp out treason!
I have no confidence in you boyars.
Therefore as God created man in his own image, so I have created men in mine.
They will carry out my orders and only they will enjoy my confidence.
That is why I have christened them Oprichniki.
These plans come not from God... but from the devil.
He who defies ancestral traditions, shall not remain sovereign for long.
Fyodor Kolychev!
Say no more.
Why are you so severe with me,
Fyodor Kolychev?
Why, my good friend, are you so cruel?
You should really pity me!
I am not Kolychev, I am Philip the monk.
I carry out the will of God, not the designs of the Tsar.
Listen,
ever since I was a child,
the boyars showed their hatred of the Grand Duke of Moscow.
After my father's death,
my mother was killed.
They have poisoned me!
Ah! I am dying!
My son!
They have killed me!
Watch out for poison!
Beware of the boyars!
Elena Glinskaya is dead.
That's how I came to be an orphan, alone and abandoned, whilst the boyars governed in my name and handed over Russian territory to foreign enslavement.
Ivan Vasilievich, Grand Duke of Moscow, has graciously ratified a commercial treaty and agrees to pay duties for the transit of goods via the Baltic, to the great Hanseatic League of the German merchant towns.
The Grand Duke of Moscow has reconsidered his decision.
He has concluded the treaty with the Order of Livonian Knights.
Someone has certainly been lining 
Shuisky's pockets.
The Hansa!
It was the Boyar Council's decision.
The Grand Duke is free to annul the council's decisions.
But he has pledged his word.
The Grand Duke is the sole arbiter of his word.
He gives it or rescinds it as he pleases.
It is the Grand Duke's will which constitutes the law.
But the will of the Grand Duke is to conclude a treaty with the Hansa.
The Grand Duke's will is to concede the privileges to the Livonian Order.
The Grand Duke's will is law!
We must pay the Hansa!
No, we'll pay the Livonians!
The Hansa will be more profitable to the State!
You mean more profitable to yourself!
And you have been bribed by the Livonians!
The money must go to the Hansa!
We'll pay the Livonians.
We will pay no one!
We're not obliged to pay.
The coastal towns were built by our ancestors.
Those lands are our inheritance; they must be returned to Moscow.
Who would be fool enough to give them back?
Anything that falls off the back of a wagon is lost.
If they won't return them voluntarily, we shall take them back by force.
By force?
And where will we find this force?
You have wasted Russia's strength.
It has been frittered away by the boyars.
O Lord! I'll die laughing.
Take it off.
Off, I say.
Get off my mother's bed!
My mother, who was murdered by you, you dogs!
A dog, am I?
Well your mother was a bitch.
She used to sleep with that dog Telepnev.
No one even knows who your father was!
Race of dogs!
Seize him!
Seize him!
The leading boyar handed over to the kennelmen!
I shall reign alone!
Without the boyars!
I will be Tsar!
Now... I hold great power.
The people support me.
My personal guard form an iron ring around me.
My enemies are kept at bay.
But I have no close friends.
God refuses me the sweet consolations of friendship.
On whose shoulders can I rest my head?
With whom can I share my joys and sorrows?
I am alone, abandoned.
I had a single close friend, Anastasia.
She has left me.
I had a friend, Kurbsky.
He has betrayed me.
No, not just myself but our great cause.
I don't fear the trouble-makers.
I don't fear the sword, poison or betrayal.
I fear not for myself.
But I tremble for our great cause.
A new cause, on which one had hardly embarked.
There is no higher destiny than to reign according to ancient traditions.
As our ancestors did.
Pay heed to the boyars.
Share your authority with them.
You lie, monk!
These are old wives' tales!
You reject the counsel of your spiritual guide? 
Very well!
Remain alone!
Condemned, accursed... and alone!
It is no longer the Tsar who pleads with you but a friend crushed by the burden of authority.
Don't leave me in my isolation.
Stay with me.
Help me to re-establish Russian power.
And for this accept the office of Metropolitan Bishop of Moscow.
Will you allow me the right to plead in favor of those you accuse?
I never accuse the innocent.
Wait!
Very well. It shall be as you say.
Why give the bishop such power over you?
Why let yourself be humiliated by an ignorant priest?
None of your business, dog!
I know I am a dog... but a faithful dog.
You are wrong, Tsar, to prefer a priest to a dog.
I know, you want friendship.
You languish without friendship.
For friendship you are ready to bow at his feet.
Do you not see that Philip has only one idea, to conceal your enemies under his own skirts?
A friend, eh?
He's hardly worth more than Kurbsky!
You dare pronounce that name.
Ah! I know you love Kurbsky!
It's not his treachery which wounds you.
It's the loss of a friend!
You don't sleep at night!
Hold your tongue, dog!
You don't show any gratitude or affection to those who are loyal to you, who'd give their lives for you, who carry the weight of your power on their strong shoulders.
My power is carried by the shoulders of the people and their will is my strength.
I hear the voice of God through them and I carry out His holy designs.
Tsar, I beg you, don't let the priest do as he pleases.
Don't trust anyone.
You hold the power. Use it!
I understand. 
You've given your word to the priest.
You've made him promises.
You can't go back on your word.
I understand.
So we must see that the Tsar's word is respected and wipe out the traitors too.
It's just going back on your word that worries you, isn't it?
There is a way out... use a cat's paw.
No, a red-headed dog, me, Malyuta.
I'll take the Tsar's sins on my shoulders.
I'll give my soul for the Tsar.
I'll go to hell if need be, but I'll keep the Tsar's word.
What does the hound do when the game tries to go to earth?
Flies straight as an arrow to the lair.
He outwits it... heads it off, outruns it.
Outstrip the priest?
Is that what you're suggesting?
So he won't have time to double back?
You'd give your soul for the Tsar!
Eh, dog?
You complain the Tsar doesn't spoil you?
Be off with you!
Do what you have to do. 
By God's will, be judge and executioner.
And to outstrip the priest, we'll start on some of his distant relatives, the Kolychevs.
Kolychevs are untamed, but we'll tame them!
By what right do you set yourself as a judge, Tsar Ivan?
By what right do you wield the sword of justice?
Let me not drink of this cup.
You cannot avoid it... 
Even though some cups contain poison!
The cup?
The goblet.
They poisoned her!
They poisoned my sweetheart!
Who gave the fatal goblet to the Tsarina?
She received it from my own hands!
And who gave it to you?
Efrosinia!
Efrosinia?
Is it possible?
The Tsar's aunt?
My own blood relation?
Silence! 
Not a word of your suspicions to anyone until I have ferreted out the truth. 
Come!
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.
Our Sovereign Ivan Vasilievich,
Tsar and Grand Duke of all the Russias, has pronounced these boyars of the Kolychev family to be traitors.
The aforementioned boyars having been in communication with the king of Poland, with the aim of submitting to foreign domination.
Ivan Vasilievich,
Tsar of all the Russias, has condemned them to be beheaded for high treason.
Too few!
By God's power invested in you, bring the Tsar to heel.
I charge you to excommunicate him.
I shall return to my monastery.
You daren't. 
If you don't bring the Tsar to heel, you will answer for it before God!
Ah! my lord!
I ask for justice against the Tsar, and protection.
I ask that the boyars' cause be defended.
No, I do not ask, my lord, I demand!
That's not all I'm demanding.
I demand that the Tsar be humbled.
I do not ask,
I demand!
God be my witness.
It is not for myself nor for the members of my family who have been executed that I take up the sword.
It is on behalf of the boyars.
Justice must be done against the Tsar.
Beneath my priestly robes beats the heart of a Kolychev!
And a Kolychev who is a prince of the Church!
Even the Tsar can do nothing against the Church.
Come tomorrow to the cathedral!
I shall humble the Tsar.
I shall crush him with the weight of the Church.
God be praised.
Mother... 
What's the story of the fiery furnace?
The story tells how a heavenly angel led three youths called Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, out of the fiery furnace of Babylon, into which a ferocious heathen Tsar, 
Nebuchadnezzar, had thrown them.
Now, there are no such angels.
Innocent, we were flung into the burning, fiery furnace
lit by the Chaldeans,
for having disobeyed the heathen Tsar.
Chaldean! Hey! Chaldean!
What is it?
Is this the Tsar's work?
The Tsar's!
They disobeyed the Tsar?
They disobeyed!
So, we are going to hurl them into the burning, fiery furnace!
We are given into
the hands of lawless princes,
wretched apostates.
Into the hands of an unjust Tsar
who is the wickedest in the world.
With her staff the old lady...
Hands off the Tsar's aunt!
She's Tsarina in her own house!
So she slapped your faces, you and your henchmen!
I recognize the family spirit right enough!
Perhaps this is the right moment to polish off the Staritskys with one blow.
They've opposed the Tsar's will!
It is not for you, Alexei, to tell the Tsar what to do.
Not for you, Fyodor, to raise your hand against the Tsar's family.
No harm shall come to Efrosinia, as long as she calls herself the Tsar's aunt and does not claim to become the mother of a Tsar, a Tsar who submits to the boyars.
As for you, Basmanovs... learn to keep your place!
And the poisoned goblet... have you forgotten that?
Be quiet.
Be quiet, Fyodor! 
Don't mention that grave charge!
God grant it was not she who was guilty!
Why, shameless Chaldeans,
do you serve a lawless Tsar?
Why, bewitched Chaldeans,
do you serve a devilish, blaspheming and despotic Tsar?
Why do you torment us with fire?
Why do you burn us?
And now, bear witness to a miracle.
The terrestrial lord will be humbled
by the Lord of Hosts.
The Tsar of all the Russias begs your blessing.
I do not recognize the Orthodox Tsar in his pagan actions!
In what way, monk, do my actions concern you?
Your actions are those of a bloodthirsty beast!
Silence, Philip. 
If you question my sovereignty you will incur my anger!
Now bear witness to a miracle.
The terrestrial lord will be humbled
by the Lord of Hosts.
Ivan, like Nebuchadnessar, you cast those who are close to you into the fire.
But the avenging angel will descend from heaven and free them from their prison.
Silence, Philip!
Submit to the authority of the Church, Ivan!
Repent!
Dissolve the Oprichnina before it's too late!
Ivan... dissolve the Oprichnina before it is too late!
Silence!
Mother, is that the terrible and godless Tsar?
Mother, it is the terrible and godless Tsar!
It is her, Fyodor!
It is her.
From now on I will be just what you say I am!
I will be terrible!
Philip has been arrested.
He's been forbidden to go back to the monastery.
He'll be given a savage trial.
He will be condemned.
In the old days they would have handed Philip over to us for trial.
We'd never have let him be humiliated.
It's no good living in the past.
We must find a solution.
There is no solution.
There is a solution.
Just one.
The last.
Kill the Tsar.
Either kill the Tsar or lay our own heads on the block.
But who will do it?
Only the pure in heart would be worthy of carrying out so elevated a mission!
Pyotr Volynets,
I consecrate this mission to you.
Come, my brothers, embrace for the last time.
God's servant, Peter, who lately dwelt among us.
He has vowed himself to the grave.
He will repose beneath a cold slab.
He is entering into the shades.
He bids farewell to friends and relations.
He will lie with the dead.
He confiscated Church property.
We will exterminate the beast!
We must save Philip, because he has incurred Ivan's wrath for our sake.
That will depend on Philip's judges.
Who will preside at the Tribunal?
To whom must we send our gold, plate and furs?
It is I who will preside at the tribunal.
That means he's saved!
That means he's lost!
Philip is more useful to our cause as a martyr.
A corpse, a martyr.
A saint is more valuable to our struggle.
A dead man... A saint is invincible, even for the Tsar!
His cowl is white, but his soul is black.
Why are you always trying to make a leader of me, mother?
Why do you want to sacrifice me?
A black beaver was bathing in the river
In the frozen Moscow River
He didn't wash himself cleaner
He only got blacker
Having taken his bath, the beaver
Went off to the capital's High hill
To dry himself, shake himself and look around
To see if anyone was coming to look for him
The hunters whistle
Searching out the black beaver
The hunters follow the scent
They will find the black beaver
They want to catch and skin the beaver
And with its fur then to adorn a kingly mantle
In order to array
Tsar Vladimir!
I'd suffer the pangs of your birth a hundred times over for you to ascend the throne.
To see you seated on the Tsar's throne!
Take the crown.
Take the collar.
I've always been frightened of blood.
You won't have to shed it.
That will be Pyotr's job.
Yes... but after to be haunted by remorse for the rest of my life, always seeing him wherever I go, enduring his silent reproaches.
Whatever else you need fear, it's not that.
When the throne is yours, you will punish the regicide.
And others, too.
A sovereign should not stray from the path of righteousness if he can help it, but he must be prepared to tread the path of evil if necessary.
Our great sovereign offers you a cup of wine.
Moreover our great sovereign invites his cousin Vladimir Andreyevich to the royal table.
The hand of God!
Our cause prospers!
You will accompany Pyotr to the banquet.
And don't forget to wear your new kaftan.
I'll remind him!
The hand of God!
Our cause prospers!
It's empty!
Holla! Holla!
Faster! Faster!
Bravo! Bravo!
Ah, Brother Vladimir, you don't love me.
You don't care that I am so alone, that I'm just a poor abandoned orphan whom no one pities.
It's not right for the Tsar to fraternize with the landowners, and above all not with the Staritskys!
It is not for you, Alexei, to teach the Tsar his business, nor to raise your hand against the Tsar's relations.
But it was you who taught me to weed them out.
The Tsar's connections outshine all other connections.
As the celestial tamarind outshines homely oak.
Aren't we the new forest growing around you?
I don't hack down oaks to make room for wretched aspens.
Don't touch the Tsar's relations!
The ties of blood are sacred!
Aren't we who are closest to you bound to you by other blood, blood which has been shed?
You're no relation of mine.
You are my slaves.
I raised you from the dust to crush the boyar traitors.
I express my will through you.
Your function is to serve me, not to teach me how to behave.
Keep to your place, Basmanovs!
You are beginning to catch the boyars' sickness.
You are beginning to get ideas about rank.
Would you like to put yourself beside the Tsar?
I've sworn never to fraternise with the boyars nor with the landowners.
I am alone, a poor orphan.
No one loves or pities me!
The guests have assembled in the courtyards of the boyars
In the courtyards of the boyars
The axes skim the necks of the boyars
The axes, the axes
Come along! Come along!
What happens next?
What happens next?
Come on, tell us more
Come on, tell us more
Strike with the axes
The gates have split down the middle
Down the middle
The golden goblets pass from hand to hand
From hand to hand
Come along. Come along
What happens next?
What happens next?
Come on, tell us more
Come on, tell us more
Strike with the axes!
Oh, you are wrong,
Tsar of all the Russias,
- you have friends.
- I haven't one.
- Yes, you have!
- Don't lie.
- I'm not lying.
- Then who is my friend?
- Well, me for one.
- I don't believe you!
I swear it!
Don't swear it. 
Prove it by your actions!
I will prove it!
And when the guests are parting having drunk their fill
Drunk their fill
They set fire to the castle
Set fire to the castle
Come along. Come along
What happens next?
What happens next?
Come on, tell us more
Come on, tell us more
Strike with the axes!
What is Archbishop Pimen's man doing amongst the servants?
Pimen assigned him to the service of Vladimir Andreyevich.
You lie... You won't prove anything!
I will... I will prove it to you!
You sit here celebrating and you don't even know some people want you out of the way.
- Is that so?
- I swear it!
And who do they want in my place?
You'd never guess!
I said to her, who'd want to be Tsar?
Plots... executions.
As for me... I'm just a peaceful man; all I ask of life is to drink and live in peace.
Indeed, who'd want to be Tsar?
The task is a heavy one!
That's exactly what I said.
Why do I want to be Tsar?
But she insists.
Take it... take the crown.
Take the collar.
Take the collar...
Take the crown.
Take it!
Take it! Why not?
Take it, cousin!
Bring the Tsar's regalia!
He likes it, this lackey of the Poles!
The farce is over.
Enough of this ungodly revelry!
Brothers, let's address ourselves to the Almighty!
Let us think upon our last hour.
Awake, my soul
Awake
Lead us to the cathedral!
A Tsar does not draw back.
The Tsar is always first to enter!
Ivan is no more!
Good people, look!
Ivan is no more!
The brute is dead!
Russia shall flourish under a boyar Tsar! 
Vladimir!
Holy Mother of God...
No!
Torture me!
Execute me!
You'll never make me speak!
I won't give anyone away.
Why are you holding him?
It was not the Tsar he killed... only the fool!
Let him go.
And it was not only a fool he killed but the Tsar's worst enemy!
My grateful thanks!
As for her...
They want to catch
and skin a beaver
And with its fur then to adorn
A kingly mantle for... for...
Tsar Vladimir
As for her...
A black beaver was bathing...
I swear before God to accomplish
In Russia, my royal mission
To purge the Motherland of her savage enemies
To shed with my own hands the blood of the guilty
Without mercy, either to myself or others
For the sake of the great land of Russia.
A Tsar must always weigh and assess.
Mercy and gentleness for the good.
Cruelty and torment for the wicked.
A Tsar who hesitates in this will never make a Tsar!
Today in Moscow, we have struck down the enemies of Russian unity.
My hands are free!
From now on the sword of justice shall flash against those who dare to oppose from without the greatness of Russian might.
We will not let Russia be abused!
- Oh, Dr. Hill.
- Dr. Bassett.
Where's the patient?
- I hated to drag you out of bed at this time of night.
- Will you let me go while there's still time?
- You'll soon see why I did.
Doc, will you tell these fools I'm not crazy?
Make them listen to me before it's too late.
- I'll listen to you.
Let him go.
- Who are you?
- I'm Dr. Hill from the state mental hospital.
- I'm not insane.
- Let him go.
- Listen, doctor, now you must listen to me.
You must understand me.
I'm a doctor, too.
I am not insane.
I am not insane.
- Alright, alright.
Now suppose we just sit down over here Dr. Bennell and you tell me what happened?
- Well, it started.
For me it started last Thursday.
In response to an urgent message from my nurse,
I'd hurried home from a medical convention I'd been attending.
At first glance, everything looked the same.
It wasn't.
Something evil had taken possession of the town.
These two.
Here you are.
- Thank you, sir.
There you are.
- Thank you.
Morning, Mr. Fisher.
- Doc.
- Hiya, Sally.
- Hi.
Welcome home I'm glad you're back.
- How's Mickey and the baby?
- They're fine but it seems that everybody else in Santa
Mira needs a doctor.
You've got an office full of patients.
- Oh, no, on my first day back?
- Well, some of them been waiting for two weeks.
- Why didn't you send them to Percy or Carmichael like I told you to?
- Most of them wouldn't go.
They wanna see you.
- Oh.
What's the matter with them?
- They wouldn't say.
You know usually people can't talk enough about what's ailing them.
For instance Wally Eberhard was in twice and called three times about something, but he wouldn't tell me what it was.
- That's funny.
- Neither would anyone else from Becky Driscoll down to that fat traffic cop Sam Janzek.
- Becky Driscoll.
I thought she was in England.
- She got back a few days ago, and she wanted to see you.
Are you still interested?
- My interest in married women is strictly professional or yours would have been a lost cause long ago.
- How was the convention?
- Wonderful.
They wept with envy when I read my paper.
- Jimmy, come back here.
Jimmy.
- What's the matter, Mrs. Grimaldi?
- It's nothing he just don't wanna go to school.
- If I were you I'd have a talk with his teacher.
- I will when I get time.
- What's the matter has Joe been sick?
- No, we gave the stand up too much work.
- Oh.
The boy's panic should have told me it was more than school he was afraid of and that littered, closed-up vegetable stand should have told me something, too.
When I last saw it less than a month ago, it was the cleanest and busiest stand on the road.
- That's strange.
She was in to see you too last Friday.
I tried to get her to go see
Doc Percy but she wouldn't.
She said only you could help her.
- Well, whatever it was it couldn't have been too serious I guess.
One minor concussion, two cases of the common cold and six canceled appointments.
Looks like you rushed me here for nothing.
- I don't understand it, Miles.
They couldn't wait to see you.
But you're still booked up solid for the afternoon.
- I bet they don't show.
Look there's Wally Eberhard talking somebody into buying some insurance.
There's nothing wrong with him.
Bill Bitner's taking his secretary to lunch.
And speaking of lunch will you tell whoever that is that I'm out having mine?
- Is Dr. Bennell in?
- Yes, he's here.
- Do you suppose he has time to see me a moment?
- Well, if he hasn't something's wrong with him.
Go right in.
- Becky.
Almost five years.
- It's wonderful to be home again.
I've been away so long I feel almost like a stranger in my own country.
Hope you don't mind my coming without an appointment.
- Not at all.
What'll you have?
We're pushing appendectomies this week.
- Oh, Miles.
- I don't know maybe I clown around too much.
Pretty soon my patients won't trust me to prescribe aspirin for them.
Seriously, what's the trouble?
- It's my cousin.
- Wilma.
What's the matter with her?
- She has a...
Well, I guess you'd call it a delusion.
You know her uncle, Uncle Ira?
- Sure I'm his doctor.
- Well, Miles she's got herself thinking he isn't her uncle.
- How do you mean that they're not really related?
- No, she thinks he's an impostor or something someone who only looks like Ira.
- Have you seen him?
- I just came from there.
- Well, is he Uncle Ira or isn't he Uncle Ira?
- Of course he is I told
Wilma that but it was no use.
Please, would you stop by and have a talk with her?
- Well, Sally says that I'm booked up for the afternoon but why don't you ask her to come in and see me?
- I'll try.
- How about some lunch?
- I can't I'm meeting dad at the store.
- When did you get back?
- I came back from London two months ago.
I've been in Reno.
- Reno.
- Reno.
Dad tells me you were there, too.
- Five months ago.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- So was I.
I wanted it to work.
Well, I guess that makes us lodge brothers now.
- Yes.
- Except that I'm paying dues while you collect them.
- Miles.
- Hello, Jordan.
- How are you?
Sam.
- Hello, doc.
- At it again, eh?
My nurse tells me you were in last week and wanted very much to see me.
- It wasn't anything important.
- Say, didn't he go to college with us?
- Quit his second year to get married like I wanted us to do.
- Just be thankful I didn't take you seriously.
- You be thankful.
I found out that a doctor's wife needs the understanding of an Einstein and patience of a saint.
- And love?
- I wouldn't know about that.
I'm just a general practitioner.
Love is handled by the specialists.
- Well, here's where I leave you.
- You know something this is where you left me the last time.
Hiya, Johnny.
Sally, I'm off.
Will you tell the answering service I'll be at home?
- Good night, doc.
- Goodnight.
- I'm not going in there.
- You're gonna listen to me stop all this nonsense and be a good boy come on.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey take it easy.
Isn't this Jimmy Grimaldi?
- Yes, doctor, can I talk to you a moment?
- Sure you know I almost ran you down this morning.
You've gotta be careful when you run out in the road.
- Come on now.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey slow down now.
Look school isn't as bad as all that.
- School isn't what upsets him.
It's my daughter-in-law.
He's got the crazy idea she isn't his mother.
- She isn't. She isn't.
Don't let her get me.
- Nobody's gonna get you, Jimmy.
- How long has this been going on?
- An hour ago I found him hiding in the cellar having hysterics.
He wouldn't tell me anything until I started to phone his mother.
That's when he said
Anna wasn't his mother.
- Could you keep him with you for a day or so?
- Of course.
- Give him one of these every four hours during the day.
Call me tomorrow and let me know how he's feeling.
- Yes, doctor, thank you.
- Don't let her get me.
- Nobody's gonna get you, Jimmy.
- All right, Jimmy, open your mouth.
Shut your eyes.
In the words of the poet
I'll give you something to make you wise.
- That's a good boy, Jimmy.
- I'm not going home ever.
- You're gonna stay at your grandmother's house.
Will you call his mother and tell her that--
- She's not my mother.
- Alright, alright, alright run along, run along.
Everything's gonna be alright.
You be a good boy now go on, alright.
- Good bye, doctor.
- Good night.
Sally, I've changed my mind.
I'm not going directly home.
I'm going to stop off and see Wilma Lentz.
- Should I call the boy's mother?
- Yes, call her and tell her what happened and that I suggested it might be a good idea if the boy spend the night at his grandmother's house.
- Hello, Miles.
- Nice to see you, Wilma, Becky.
- Let's have it.
You talked to him what do you think?
- It's him.
He's your Uncle Ira, alright.
- He is not.
- How is he different?
- That's just it there is no difference you can actually see.
He looks, sounds, acts, and remembers like Uncle Ira.
- Then he is your Uncle Ira.
Can't you see that?
No matter how you feel he is.
- But he isn't there's something missing.
He's been a father to me since I was a baby.
Always when he talked to me there was a special look in his eye.
That look's gone.
- What about memories?
There must be certain things that only you and he would know about.
- There are I've talked to him about them.
He remembers them all down to the last small detail just like Uncle Ira would.
But, Miles, there's no emotion.
None just the pretense of it.
The words, gesture, the tone of voice everything else is the same but not the feeling.
Memories or not he isn't my Uncle Ira.
Wilma, I'm on your side.
My business is people in trouble, and I'm gonna find a way to help you.
Now no one could possibly impersonate your Uncle Ira without you or your Aunt Eleda or even me seeing a million little differences.
I want you to realize that.
Think about it, and then you'll know that the trouble is inside you.
- Wilma, where are you?
- Out on the lawn.
Say nothing to her.
- Why, Miles, I didn't know you were here.
Welcome home.
- Hello, Mrs. Lentz.
- Did you ask Miles to stay for dinner?
- Can't tonight.
- I'm making spoon bread.
- Please, don't tempt me.
- Well, maybe next time.
Wilma, where are my glasses?
- I think I saw them on the mantelpiece.
I'll go with you.
- Miles, am I going crazy?
Don't spare me I've got to know.
- No, you're not.
Even these days it isn't as easy to go crazy as you might think.
But you don't have to be losing your mind to need psychiatric help.
I'd like you to see a doctor friend of mine.
- A psychiatrist?
- Dan Kauffman.
I'll make an appointment for you tomorrow.
- Alright.
But it's a waste of time.
There's nothing wrong with me.
We better break this up or he'll start wondering.
- Wondering what?
- If I don't suspect.
You've been a big help.
I don't want you to worry about him me or you either I'll be alright.
- Sure you will.
Staying here, Becky, or may I drive you home?
- Would you like me to stay?
- Of course not.
Good night.
- Good night.
- Nice having Becky back again, eh, boy?
- Sure is.
In the back of my mind a warning bell was ringing.
Sick people who couldn't wait to see me then suddenly were perfectly alright.
A boy who said his mother wasn't his mother.
A woman who said her uncle wasn't her uncle.
But I didn't listen.
Obviously, the boy's mother was his mother.
I'd seen her.
And Uncle Ira was Uncle Ira.
There was no doubt of that after I talked to him.
- Miles, he is Ira?
- Of course he is what do you mean?
- It's just that Wilma's so positive.
Will she be all right?
- I think so.
I'm a doctor according to my diploma but I don't really know what Wilma's trouble is.
I could start talking psychiatrical jargon but it's out of my line and in Dan Kauffman's.
I wish you didn't have to go home for dinner.
- I don't.
Dad's eating out with a friend.
I could pick you up at 7:00.
- Well.
- It's summer and the moon is full, and I know a bank where
- the wild thyme grows.
- You haven't changed a bit.
- Whup, whoa watch out.
- Sorry.
Hey, Miles, when did you get back?
- This morning how are you, Danny?
This is Miss Driscoll.
Dr. Kauffman our one and only psychiatrist.
- How do you do.
- Watch out what you say.
Ed, you remember Becky.
- I should I brought her into the world.
- You did us all a favor.
- Hello, Dr. Percy.
- This saves me a phone call.
I've got a mixed up kid and a woman who need a witch doctor.
- The boy says his father isn't his father and the woman says her sister isn't her sister?
- That's pretty close.
I knew you'd been studying hypnosis, but when did you start reading minds?
- He doesn't have to read them.
I've sent him a dozen patients since it started.
- What is it?
What's going on?
- I don't know a strange neurosis evidently contagious, an epidemic of mass hysteria.
In two weeks it spread all over town.
- What causes it?
- Worry about what's going on in the world probably.
- Make room for Wilma Lentz tomorrow will you Danny?
Send her in around 2:00.
Good night.
- So long, Danny.
Well, this is the oddest thing I ever heard of.
Let's hope we don't catch it.
I'd hate to wake up some morning and find out that you weren't you.
- I'm not the high-school kid you used to romance, so how could you tell?
- You really want to know?
- Mm-hmm.
- Mmm, you're Becky Driscoll.
- Hey, Santa Mira's looking up.
- Has ever since you got back.
- Is this an example of your bedside manner, doctor?
- No, ma'am that comes later.
- Evening, doctor.
- What happened to the crowd tonight?
- I don't know it's been this way for two or three weeks now.
- Well, at least we don't have to wait for a table.
- Take your pick in here or here.
- Here, I think.
Shall we?
- Mm-hmm.
- Where's the band?
- Well, business started falling off, so I had to let them go.
There's the jukebox, though.
- Shall we dance?
I hope you didn't let the bartender go.
- I'm the bartender.
Martinis?
- Two, dry.
Very dry.
- Miles, I don't care what Dr. Kauffman says.
I'm worried.
- You are in the capable hands of your personal physician.
- Oh, doctor.
- Ah, there's our evening.
Sorry.
Thanks.
Dr. Bennell.
- Jack Belicec wants you to come to his house right away, doctor.
He says it's urgent.
- Thank you.
Better hold those drinks.
Emergency.
Well, at least they called before we ordered dinner.
How hungry are you?
- I can wait.
- It may be a while.
- I can go with you.
- Sorry, we'll be back later.
There's Jack.
Hello, Jack, what's the matter?
Teddy sick?
- No.
- Miles, thank heaven I thought you'd never get here.
- Well, if you're not sick who is?
- Nobody.
- Well, then why'd you drag me away from my dinner?
- Well, you won't believe it, Miles, until you see it for yourself.
Hello, Becky, good to see you again.
Hi, Becky. Hi Teddy.
Would you be able to forget that you're a doctor a while?
- Why?
- I don't want you to call the police right away.
- Quit acting like a writer what's going on?
- Maybe you can tell me you're the doctor.
Miles, put the light on over the pool table.
Go on pull it down.
Well, what do you make of it?
- Who is he?
- I have no idea.
- Its face, Miles, it's vague.
- It's like the first impression that's stamped on a coin.
It isn't finished.
- You're right.
It has all the features but no details no character, no lines.
- It's no dead man.
Have you got an ink pad around the house?
- There should be one in the desk, why?
- I wanna take the corpse's fingerprints.
- Of course it's a dead man what else could it be?
- I don't know but I've got a feeling that
I know this sounds crazy but if I should do an autopsy
I think I'd find every organ in perfect condition, just as perfect as the body is externally everything in working order.
All set to go hold that down.
These are blank.
- Waiting for the final finished face to be stamped onto it.
- But whose face?
Tell me that.
- I think we could all use a drink.
- Bourbon all right?
- Fine.
- Not for me, thanks.
- Miles, answer me.
Whose face?
- I haven't the slightest idea, honey, have you?
- How tall would you say that thing is?
- Oh, 5'10", thereabout.
- How much does it weigh?
- I don't know it's pretty thin.
Maybe 140 pounds.
- Jack's 5'10" and weighs 140 pounds.
- Teddy, will you stop talking nonsense?
- I'm sorry, darling.
- Come on let's have that hand.
- But it isn't nonsense.
Becky, you don't think it's nonsense, do you?
- Well, of course it is.
Jack's standing here in front of you.
- Of course I am bleeding to death.
Excuse me.
- You know what?
I'm afraid you may live.
Here, this should fix it.
- Miles, don't you think we should we call the police and have them take that dead body out of here?
- I'm afraid it isn't just a dead body.
- Thanks.
- I wonder if.
- What?
- I wonder if there's any connection.
- What do you mean?
- There's something strange going on in Santa Mira.
Dr. Kauffman calls it an epidemic of mass hysteria.
Becky's cousin's got it for one.
She thinks that her uncle and her aunt aren't her uncle and her aunt.
There's several cases of such delusion.
Now this isn't you yet but there is a structural likeness.
It's fantastic but there must be some reason why this thing is in your house.
Would you be willing to sit up with your strange friend and see what his next move is?
If nothing happens by morning call the police.
If something happens call me, will you?
- You know I will.
- Good night take it easy.
- Sure.
- Now nothing's going to happen.
- Good night, honey.
- Well, if it does it'll make a charming, bloodcurdling mystery story.
- I was careful not to let Becky know but for the first time
I was really scared.
Dan Kauffman's explanation of what was wrong in town mass hysteria couldn't explain away that body on Jack's billiard table.
- Come in while I turn the lights on.
- You're a forward wench dragging me into a dark hallway to be kissed.
- I'm dragging you into a dark hallway because I'm scared of the dark tonight.
- In that case I'd better stay and tuck you in.
- That way lies madness.
- What's wrong with madness?
- Madness.
Now good night.
- Well, it's about time you two got home.
- Dad, what are you doing in the basement this time of night?
- Working in my shop.
How about a nightcap, doc?
- No, thanks it's kind of late.
I'll take a rain check.
Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night, Miles.
- Look, Jack, it's you.
It's you.
No, no you mustn't go near it.
Get out of here please
Please.
- Miles.
- What happened, Jack?
- Teddy says the thing at our place is me right down to the cut on my hand.
Sit down, baby.
I didn't wait to look.
- It's alive.
It's alive.
The hand was cut and bleeding.
And the position of the body had changed.
- Here, here, take this.
I'll call Danny Kauffman.
- Hello.
- Hello, Danny.
- Yeah.
- Something's happened and
I've got to see you right away.
Will you get over here as fast as you can?
It's important.
- Oh, okay.
- He's on his way.
I'll make some coffee and be right with you.
- Good deal, Miles, thanks.
Miles, what about Becky.
Do you think she's all right?
- Dad, what are you doing in the basement this time of night?
- Working in my shop.
- I don't know what it was call it a premonition but suddenly I had the feeling that Becky was in danger.
I had to get to her as quickly as possible.
I was going to ring the bell but then I had a hunch
I'd better be careful.
Something was wrong in this house.
Becky.
Becky.
Becky.
- Miles, will you tell me what happened?
- The same thing.
I found another one in the cellar at Becky's house coming to life while I stood there watching it.
It was Becky.
- Yeah, I want to see one of these bodies.
- Alright.
- Now, you're going to bed and you're staying with her.
Put on your clothes we'll go to Jack's first.
Got any coffee around here?
- Yeah, you'll find some in the kitchen.
- He doesn't believe me, Beck.
- He will.
- Somebody's playing games.
- Rough ones.
There's a blood spot.
What you saw was the body of a murdered man.
Did you examine it carefully?
- Yes.
I don't know what's happened to it.
It was not an ordinary body and there wasn't a mark on it.
- I checked it too when
I put it on the table.
There wasn't a scratch.
- You can kill a man by shoving an ice pick into the base of his brain and leave a puncture so small the naked eye can't see it.
- Danny, you're ignoring the fact that this was not a normal body.
You heard what Teddy said about the hand.
- I heard lots of things Teddy said and none of them made sense.
- Alright now hold onto it, pal, I was here too.
So was Miles.
Now look we took his fingerprints.
Look at that tell me why it didn't have any.
- He didn't want any so he took them off with acid.
- Stop trying to rationalize everything will you.
Let's face it we have a mystery on our hands.
- Sure you have a real one.
Whose body was it and where is it now, a completely normal mystery.
Whatever it is it's well within the bounds of human experience and I don't think you ought to make anymore of it.
- I wouldn't if I hadn't looked in Becky's cellar.
How do you explain away the body I saw there?
- I don't think you saw one there.
- You don't think I saw one here either?
- I know you did because three others saw it, too.
- But I dreamed up the second one?
- Doctors can have hallucinations, too.
The mind is a strange and wonderful thing.
I'm not sure it'll ever be able to figure itself out.
Everything else maybe from the atom to the universe everything except itself.
- Nevertheless, I saw Becky's double and the body that we saw here bore an uncomfortable resemblance to Jack.
- Yeah, a mighty uncomfortable.
- Alright let's go on to
Becky's and have a look.
Alright where's your girlfriend's double?
- Okay, skeptic lift the lid.
- There's a body here, alright.
- It's Becky's double.
- It sure is.
- Take another look.
Now you see it, now you don't.
- It was there half-hidden by that blanket.
- You said you saw it there just now.
- I thought I did.
- Why did you come here tonight?
You'd seen a dead man at
Jack's an average-sized man.
The face in death was smooth and unlined bland in expression which often happens.
You had just become aware of a curious, unexplainable, epidemic mass hysteria.
Men, women, and children suddenly convince themselves that their relatives weren't their relatives at all so your mind started playing tricks and reality became unreality.
The dead man became Jack's double in your eyes.
- Look come off it will you, Dan.
- I know, Miles, this all hard to believe, but these things happen even to witch doctors like me.
- I saw her here she was real.
- You saw her alright in every tiny detail as vividly as anyone has ever seen anything but only in your mind.
- Look, Danny, you can talk all night, but you're not gonna convince me.
- What in heaven's name are you doing in my cellar?
- Using it for an office, Mr. Driscoll.
These gentlemen are patients badly in need of psychiatric treatment.
Stop talking nonsense.
- I'm not they've been having nightmares.
- Well, if you're drunk you'd better sober up quick.
The police are on their way here.
- No, we're not drunk.
- Nothing that simple as that.
Pull up a chair.
- Why, you're crazy all of you.
- Hey, what's going on down there?
- Hello, Nick, glad to see you.
You saved these two characters a trip to the station.
They want to report finding a body and losing it.
- Where, when?
At my place about 7:00.
- Why did you wait so long to report it?
You know better than that, doc.
- Yeah, well, it was a curious sort of a body and then it wasn't there anymore.
- I have a good mind to throw you both in jail.
- But if you had seen it you'd understand why we waited.
- Thin man, 5'10", fingerprints burned off with acid
I Just seen it on the slab in the morgue.
It turned up in a burning haystack on Mike Gessner's south pasture two hours ago.
Now break it up.
Go on home.
- Well, you win pick up the marbles.
Good morning.
- Good morning.
Orange juice.
- Thank you.
- How do you like your eggs?
- Any way you'd like.
- Boiled, two minutes?
- Two minutes?
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.
You know dragging you out of bed in the middle of the night was a lot of trouble but it was worth it.
- Seriously, Miles.
What was that?
- Who is it?
- It's the gas man.
Morning, doc.
- Good morning, Charlie.
I guess I'm a little jittery.
Not getting enough sleep.
- Well, I won't be bothering you anymore.
Putting the meter outside on the patio.
- Okay.
- The eggs will be hard-boiled.
- Did you do this for your husband?
- Mm-hmm.
Didn't your wife do this for you?
- Oh, yes, she liked to cook.
That's one of the reasons why I'm single.
I never was there when dinner was on the table.
Well, take my advice and don't get mixed up with a doctor.
They're seldom at home.
- What would you say if I told you
I was already mixed up with a doctor?
- I'd say it was too good to be true.
- Things like this can happen all of a sudden.
- What's all of a sudden about two people who've know each other most of their lives.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- I thought I smelled some coffee.
Why didn't you give me a call?
- I didn't want to wake Teddy.
- Oh, she's wide-awake.
Got a good sleep.
- Good.
- But I don't feel that she should go home right away, Miles.
Would you mind taking in a couple boarders for a while?
Or do you have something else in mind?
- Well, I was toying with an idea but you can stay.
- Here, Jack.
- Thank you, doll, I'll take it to Teddy.
- Miles, did you make that appointment for me with the psychiatrist?
- Yes, 2:00.
- I don't need him.
I feel like such a fool.
I woke up this morning and everything was alright.
You don't know how relieved I am.
- Yes, I do.
Listen will you call Becky and tell her about it.
She was worried about you.
- Alright.
- She's at my house.
- At your house why?
- Well, it's a long story but she'll tell you about it.
- Becky's still at his house.
- Alright.
- Good morning.
- Morning, Sally.
- Take a peek at what's in the reception room.
- Mother, why don't we go home?
- In a little while, Jimmy.
- He certainly made a quick recovery.
- I guess we all have.
But driving home I had a lot of questions and no answers.
How could Jimmy and
Wilma seem so normal now?
Surely I had done nothing to cure them.
Maybe they wanted me to feel secure but why?
Well.
- I hope you didn't forget the steaks.
- I never forget anything.
- Don't worry about him he's completely housebroken.
- I need a martini, Beck.
- Onion or olive?
- Doesn't matter.
I wanna pour it on the charcoal.
I can't get this stuff to burn.
- A martini isn't dry enough.
I'll get you something to start it.
For drinking purposes.
You're looking shipshape.
- Thank you, sir.
- Here we are.
Jack.
Jack.
- They're like huge seedpods.
- This must be the way that body in my closet was formed.
Miles, where do they come from?
- I don't know.
If they are seeds or seedpods they must grow someplace on a plant probably.
Somebody or something wants this duplication to take place.
- But when they're finished what happens to our bodies?
- I don't know.
When the process is complete probably the original is destroyed or disintegrates.
No, wait.
- I'm sorry but I take a dim view of watching my own destruction take place.
- There isn't any danger until they're completely formed.
We learned that last night at your house.
Your blank didn't change right away.
- Not until you fell asleep.
Miles, when the change does take place do you suppose there's any difference?
- There must be.
Wilma noticed it.
So did little Jimmy.
- So did I.
My father.
- That must be what he was doing in the cellar last night placing one of these I'm sorry.
- I felt something wrong but I thought it was me because I'd been away for so long.
- They have to be destroyed all of them.
- They will be every one of them.
Listen we're gonna have to search every building every house in town.
Men, women, and children are gonna have to be examined.
We've got some phoning to do.
- Well, I'm gonna stay right here where I can watch them.
- I'm gonna staying with you.
- Don't call the police.
Nick Grivett didn't find any body on a burning haystack.
- Why don't you call
Danny maybe he can help.
- Danny.
No, I'm afraid it's too late to call Danny, too.
- Well, what are you gonna do?
- Get help.
I hope whatever's taking place is confined to Santa Mira.
- Operator.
- Hello, this is Dr. Bennell.
This is an emergency I wanna talk to the
Federal Bureau of
Investigation in Los Angeles.
- Can you make them believe you?
- I've got to.
- Where did they come from?
- So much has been discovered these past few years.
That anything is possible.
Maybe the results of atomic radiation on plant life or animal life some weird alien organism, a mutation of some kind.
- Why should they take the form of people of us?
- I don't know, I don't know.
Whatever it is whatever intelligence or instinct it is that can govern the forming of human flesh and blood out of thin air is it's fantastically powerful beyond any comprehension, malignant.
All that body in your cellar needed was a mind, and it was--
- And it was taking mine while I was asleep.
I could take that pitchfork myself.
- On your call to Los Angeles, doctor they don't answer.
- Well, try again.
That office is open day and night.
If they've taken over the telephone office we're dead.
- Is that me?
- This is an emergency, emergency.
Now look there's been...
Operator, get me a better connection.
- I'll try, doctor.
It's no use all the Los
Angeles circuits are dead.
- Alright try Sacramento.
Give me the state capital I wanna talk to the governor.
- The Sacramento circuits are busy, doctor.
I'll call you back.
- Alright.
Alright I'll wait for your call.
I'll take the phone outside.
Jack, they've got the phone.
Now you and the girls get in your car and make a run for it.
First town you get to yell for help.
- What about you?
- In a little while that phone is gonna ring soon.
If there's nobody here to answer it, they'll know we've gone and blocked the roads out of town.
I'll stall them till you're out of reach.
- Well, then what are you gonna do?
- Try and find out what's in back of this.
- I'm staying.
- No.
- Miles, don't ask me to leave you.
- Jack, get going.
- Miles, I can't--
- Look somebody's got to go or we don't get help.
- Please, let's get out of here.
- Watch out for yourselves.
- Go over by the phone stay there.
If it rings call me.
- Hello.
- Is Dr. Bennell there?
- Yes, I'll get him.
- Never mind.
Just tell him the Sacramento circuits are still busy and ask him if he wants me to keep trying.
- Alright, hold on.
Miles, the circuits are still busy.
- Well, tell her to keep trying.
Also try San Francisco and Washington.
We're getting out of here right now.
- Where are we going?
- Sally's.
- We're still unable to get through to Los Angeles.
Do you wish me to keep trying?
Dr. Bennell.
Dr. Bennell.
- I needed someone I could trust and I figured Sally, my nurse, was my best bet.
I decided to try to phone her to see if she was at home.
Maybe they hadn't taken over the pay phones.
I'll try the pay phone.
Hey, Mac.
- Oh, hi, doc, how are you?
- Listen would you get me a couple gallons fast?
I'm in a hurry.
- Sure.
Martha, doc's in a hurry.
Get the windshield, will you?
I have to have the keys to open the gas tank.
- Somebody sick out this way?
- There's been an accident.
- Funny we haven't heard about it.
- Well, it just happened.
- Before I could even get her number
I saw Mac closing the trunk of my car.
He could have been checking my spare tire but I didn't think so.
- That should do it.
- Thank you.
- All set.
- All set, doc.
- Fine, thanks.
Put it on my bill, will you?
- Sure, doc.
What's the matter?
- We've got to make it to Sally's house.
I wasn't sure now there was anyone I could trust, but I took a chance and drove to Sally's anyway.
When I saw several cars in front of the house,
I decided to play it safe.
- What's wrong?
- Probably nothing but we're not going in there until I'm sure it's safe.
Slide over under the wheel and get out of here fast if anybody shows up looking for us.
- The baby asleep yet, Sally?
- Not yet but she will be soon and there'll be no more tears.
- Shall I put this in her room?
- Yes, in her playpen.
No, wait maybe I'd better take it.
- Why don't you go in, Miles?
We've been waiting for you.
- Becky, start the car quick.
Becky, get going.
- Attention, all units attention, all units apprehend and detain
Dr. Miles Bennell and Becky Driscoll now believed heading north in a black and white
Ford sedan license number 2-X-3-7-7-9-6.
All units designated as roadblocks move to your stations.
It is urgent.
These two persons must be detained and not permitted to leave Santa Mira.
Repeat it is urgent.
Be on the lookout for a 1955 black and white Ford sedan license number 2-X-3-7-7-9-6.
- We'll try to make it to my office.
Cut into that alley on the right.
- Do you think he'll come back?
- I don't think they'll check again before morning.
By then Jack should be here with help.
- What if Jack doesn't get through?
- He's gotta get through.
Here now take two of these.
They'll help you to stay awake.
We can't close our eyes all night.
- We may wake up changed into something evil and inhuman.
- In my practice I've seen how people have allowed their humanity to drain away.
Only it happens slowly instead of all at once.
They didn't seem to mind.
- But just some people, Miles.
- All of us a little bit we harden our hearts and grow callous.
Only when we have to fight to stay human do we realize how precious it is to us, how dear as you are to me.
- Maybe that's Jack trying to find us.
- He'd know better than to use the phone.
Where is he?
Why doesn't he come?
Just like any Saturday morning.
Len Pearlman, Bill Bittner
Jim Clark and his wife
Shirley and their kids people I've known all my life.
- What time is it?
Yeah, I know.
It's too early to be so busy.
- What are they doing here?
- There's the answer there must be strangers in town.
They're waiting for the bus to come and go.
There isn't another one through here until 11:00.
Farmers.
Grimaldi, Pixley, Gessner.
- Crescent City.
If you have Crescent City families, step over to truck one.
Crescent City the first truck.
Redbank.
All with Redbank families or contacts go to truck number two.
All with Redbank families or contacts truck number two.
Havenhurst the third truck.
Havenhurst the third truck.
Mill Town the third truck.
Mill Town the third truck.
Valley Springs the third truck.
Valley Springs the third truck.
- First our town then all the towns around us.
It's a malignant disease spreading through the whole country.
- That's all for today.
Be ready again tomorrow.
- I can't wait for Jack any longer stay here.
- But you're not going out there?
- I've got to stop them.
- Wait we're safe here.
- They're not here
I hope we're not too late.
- Jack, thank God.
Jack, the whole town's been taken over by the pods.
- Not quite there's still you and Becky.
- Miles, it would have been so much easier if you'd gone to sleep last night.
- Now relax we're here to help you.
- You know better than that.
- Where do you want us to put them?
- Would you like to watch them grow?
- No, thanks.
- Put them in there.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
We're not going to hurt you.
- Once you understand you'll be grateful.
Remember how Teddy and
I fought against it.
We were wrong.
- You mean Teddy doesn't mind?
- Of course not she feels exactly the way I do.
- Let us go.
- We'll leave town we won't come back.
- We can't let you go.
You're dangerous to us.
- Don't fight it, Miles, it's no use.
Sooner or later you'll have to go to sleep.
- I'll wait for you in the hall.
- Miles, you and I are scientific men.
You can understand the wonder of what's happened.
Now just think.
Less than a month ago Santa Mira was like any other town people with nothing but problems.
Then out of the sky came a solution.
Seeds drifting through space for years took root in a farmer's field.
From the seeds came pods which have the power to reproduce themselves in the exact likeness of any form of life.
- So that's how it began out of the sky.
- Your new bodies are growing in there.
They're taking you over cell for cell atom for atom.
There's no pain.
Suddenly, while you're asleep they'll absorb your minds, your memories and you're reborn into an untroubled world.
- Where everyone's the same?
- Exactly.
- What a world.
We're not the last humans left.
They'll destroy you.
- Tomorrow you won't want them to.
Tomorrow you'll be one of us.
- I love Becky.
Tomorrow, will I feel the same?
- There's no need for love.
- No emotion?
Then you have no feelings only the instinct to survive.
You can't love or be loved am I right?
- You say it as if it were terrible.
Believe me, it isn't.
You've been in love before.
It didn't last.
It never does.
Love, desire, ambition, faith without them life's so simple believe me.
- I don't want any part of it.
- You're forgetting something, Miles.
- What's that?
- You have no choice.
- I guess we haven't any choice.
- Good.
- I want to love and be loved.
I want your children.
I don't want a world without love or grief or beauty.
I'd rather die.
- No.
No.
Not unless there's no other way.
- Why didn't they just give us a shot or a sleeping pill or something?
- Drugs dull the mind maybe that's the reason.
No, it wouldn't work.
I might get one or even two, but I couldn't possibly get three of them.
- You're forgetting something, darling me.
It isn't three against one.
It's three against two give me a knife.
- No.
Here.
Go over by the desk.
- What's going on in there?
- Miles.
- The door is locked.
- Miles, unlock the door.
- Come on, Miles.
Miles, open the door.
- Open the door, Miles.
- Open the door.
- Our only hope is to make it to the highway.
Well, that does it.
The only other way is out the front door and there's bound to be somebody watching.
We'll have to chance it.
Keep your eyes a little wide and blank.
Show no interest or excitement.
Well, Sam, we're finally with you.
- They were supposed to let me know.
The chief said he'd phone the station then I'd get the call.
- He phoned but the line was busy.
He's calling again now.
- Watch out.
I'm sorry, Miles.
- This is Janzek they got away.
Turn the main siren on.
Hey, stairs.
It's only a few steps more.
- Come on they went this way.
They're over there.
- Miles, I can't.
I can't, Miles, I can't.
I can't go on.
- Yes, you can.
- Here's her sweater they must be in the tunnel.
Some of you go that way.
- Give up.
You can't get away from us.
We're not gonna hurt you.
Give up.
- They're not in the tunnel.
All right, everybody, outside.
Come on let's check the hills.
Everybody, move.
- Miles, I can't stay awake much longer.
- I think they're all gone now.
We'd better start or we'll never make it to the highway.
- Miles, I've never heard anything so beautiful.
It means we're not the only ones left to know what love is.
- Stay here and pray they're as human as they sound.
Bye, darling.
- This is station KCAA, the 24-hour platter parade the station of music.
- Becky.
Becky.
Becky.
Becky, where are you?
- I'm here, Miles.
- You didn't go to sleep?
- I'm so tired.
- They weren't people.
It was more of them.
They're growing thousands of pods in greenhouses.
We've got to get away.
- I'm exhausted, Miles, I can't make it.
We can't make it without sleep.
- Yes, we can.
- I went to sleep, Miles, and it happened.
- Oh, Becky.
- They were right.
- I should never have left you.
- Stop acting like a fool,
Miles, and accept us.
- No.
Never.
- He's in here.
He's in here.
Get him.
Get him.
- I've been afraid a lot of times in my life but I didn't know the real meaning of fear until I had kissed Becky.
A moment's sleep and the girl I loved was an inhuman enemy bent on my destruction.
That moment's sleep was death to Becky's soul just as it had been for Jack and Teddy and Dan Kauffman and all the rest.
Their bodies were now hosts harboring an alien form of life, a cosmic form which to survive must take over every human man.
So I ran, I ran.
I ran as little Jimmy Grimaldi had run the other day.
My only hope was to get away from Santa Mira to get to the highway to warn the others of what was happening.
- Wait.
- Go.
Come on we gotta go.
- No, wait let him go.
They'll never believe him.
- Help.
Help.
Help, wait.
Help, help, help wait.
Wait, wait stop.
Stop and listen to me.
Listen to me.
Listen, listen, listen.
More people are coming after me they're not human.
Listen to me we're in danger.
- Get out of the street.
- Danger.
- Go on get out of here.
- You're in danger please.
- Get out of here go on get out of here.
- Get out of the road.
- All of us.
All of us they want all of us.
Now listen, listen, listen to me.
There isn't a human being left in Santa Mira.
Stop pull over.
Please, hey, stop.
Pull over to the side of the road I need your help.
Something terrible has happened.
- Go on you're drunk.
Get out of the street.
Get out of here go on.
- Are you crazy you big idiot?
- Look you fools you're in danger.
Can't you see?
They're after you.
They're after all of us our wives, our children, everyone.
They're here already.
You're next.
You're next.
You're next.
You're next.
You're next.
You don't believe a word of this, do you?
Sure, it's fantastic but it happened.
Don't just sit there measuring me for a straitjacket.
Do something get on the phone and call for help.
What's the use?
- What do you think will psychiatry help?
- If all this is a nightmare, yes.
- Of course it's a nightmare.
Plants from another world taking over human beings mad as a March hare.
What have we here?
- He ran his truck through a red light.
Greyhound bus smacked him broadside and tipped him over.
- Put him in the O.R.
Will you take over Bennell for me, doctor?
- Certainly.
- How badly is he hurt?
- Both legs and left arm broken all to bits.
We had to dig him out from under the most peculiar things I ever saw.
- What things?
- Well, I don't know what they are.
I never saw them before.
They looked like, uh, great big seedpods.
- Seedpods.
- Where was the truck coming from?
- Santa Mira.
- Get on your radio and sound an all-points alarm.
Block all highways and stop all traffic and call every law enforcement agency in the state.
Operator, get me the Federal
Bureau of Investigation.
Yes, it's an emergency.
The Crawling Eye (1958) aka The Trollenberg Terror.
What's he doing up there?
- Hey! Jimmy!
- Hang on a minute.
Can't see.
It's foggy.
Gone cold too.
What do you say?!
I tell you it's foggy!
Cloud, or something...
Hey! Wait a minute.
There's someone coming.
Who is it, Jim, the
Abominable Snowman?
I tell you, there's someone coming.
I can't see a thing.
Who is it? Who is it?
No... no...!
Nooo...!
Gerald!
- Help.
- Right.
Take the strands.
Haul it quick.
Stand by. Now pick it up.
- Heave.
- Hold.
Heave!
Can you see him?
Not yet. He's just below the lip.
Here he is. Jim?
No!
Come on! Come on!
You idiot, we nearly had him.
Why did you let him go?
Didn't you see it?
What are you taking about?
His head...
It was torn off!
Hey...? Anne?
- Huh?
- Were you dreaming?
No, I don't think so. Why?
You were talking in your sleep.
Did I give away any secrets?
Not really. I didn't quite catch his last name.
Silly.
- Would you like some tea?
- No, thank you.
You sure you feel all right?
Yeah, I feel wonderful.
I wish everybody would stop treating me like an invalid.
I'm sorry.
Look. Anne, there are the mountains.
Anne...
- What happened? Did I faint?
- Now don't worry. It's all right.
Is there anything I can do?
Oh, ah... my name is Alan Brooks.
Oh... I'm Anne Pilgrim and...
- this is my sister, Sarah.
- Hello.
How do you do?
There we are.
I'm sorry about your newspaper, Mr. Brooks.
Oh, that's all right. I've read the baseball scores.
There you are. Spot of that will bring the color back.
- You look like you might do with one.
- No, thanks.
- You have far to go?
- Geneva.
That's quite a run.
[Conductor] Trollenberg.
Next... Trollenberg.
Trollenberg?
Sarah, we're getting off at Trollenberg.
That's my stop.
What's the matter, Anne? You know we have to go on to Gen...
No! I really can't go any further today.
We can stop at the Hotel Europa.
Hotel Europa? We've never been to this place. How do you know about the Hotel Europa?
I don't know.
Anne, what's got into you?!
We're getting off at Trollenberg.
Please, Sarah!
Herr Brooks, I'm sorry I'm late.
Did you have a nice trip, I hope?
Herr Klein, nice to see you again.
Oh, I'd like you to meet
Miss Anne and Sarah Pilgrim.
Herr Klein. He's the proprietor of the Hotel Europa.
I wonder if you can help us out.
These young ladies have arrived without any reservations.
- I thought perhaps you could put them up.
- Yes...
- it will be all right.
- Good.
- Thank you very much.
- The car is outside.
It's very good of you to put us up on such short notice.
Well, this is not yet our season, you understand.
- Oh? I thought now would have been about your busiest time.
- Normally yes, but ahh...
Oh, is... is Hans still working for you?
Yes, Hans is still working for us, Herr Brooks. Thank You.
- Cigarette, Sarah?
- No, thank you.
Anne?
No, thank you.
- How about you, Herr Klein?
- Thank you. I don't smoke.
They shouldn't have started the climb.
- What are you talking about?
- An accident.
Last week. Twelve hundred feet up the south col.
Three English students.
One of them was killed.
Was there an accident,
Mr. Klein?
On a mountain, these things sometime happen.
What else do you know about the Trollenberg?
Peasants are leaving the mountain.
They say it's bad luck.
The mountain people are very simple.
They are superstitious.
All these stories are nonsense.
What stories?
Climbers, disappearing into the mist and never seen again.
- Hans, we have guests.
- Yes, sir.
Hello. You must be Mr. Brooks.
Klein told us you were coming. My name's Truscott, Philip Truscott.
How are you Mr. Truscott?
Klein, you didn't tell us we were expecting other guests.
Oh, this is Miss Sarah Pilgrim and Miss Anne Pilgrim.
Pilgrim? Sarah and Anne Pilgrim?
I'm sure we've met before.
- The name rings a bell.
- Does it?
Would you mind if we went up to our rooms now?
It's all there:
Observatory at the foot of the mountain.
Cable car.
There's a small hut the climbers use.
You can see it from the observatory.
It's all there.
Just like...
Just like what, Anne?
Well, just like...
Sarah, why did
I want to come here?
What is there about this place?
Why do I feel I've seen it all before?
Don't worry about it, darling. Lots of people get a feeling like that.
Perhaps you read about it in a book, or saw a picture in a travel folder.
You mustn't let it upset you.
No... no, I mustn't.
Yes, you're right.
I've probably read about it.
Come in.
- Hi.
- How are you?
Give you a hand?
Oh, I think I can manage.
Lovely spot this, isn't it?
- It certainly is.
- You've been here before, haven't you?
Yes, once, a couple years ago.
Good climbing.
- So they tell me.
- Don't you climb?
Not if I can help it.
Funny place to come for a holiday.
If you don't climb.
Yes, isn't it?
Attractive, those two girls, aren't they?
They certainly are.
Pilgrim sisters, Sarah and Anne...
Of course, I knew I'd seen them before somewhere.
On the Palladium, about a month ago.
They're a mind-reading act.
Funny they didn't say anything.
Well, perhaps they ah... they wanted some privacy.
Can I buy you a drink later?
- All right.
- Good.
Give me zero-x-6-4-6-8, will you?
I want you to check on someone for me.
Brooks, Alan Brooks.
He's just arrived here.
He's American. He's about
40, I should think.
Well, I should try New York first, then Los Angeles, and then Washington.
OK.
Right.
Hello there. You'll be Brooks.
- That's right.
- I'm Dewhurst. This is Brett.
- How do you do?
- How you doing?
- Looks like you're going for a climb.
- Yes, we're going up the Trollenberg.
Gonna have a noggin' before we start.
Care to join us?
All right.
- What's it gonna be?
- Scotch, please.
Scotch and the two brandies.
Better give me a bottle of brandy to take with us.
Keep the cold out tonight.
You gonna stay the night?
No, there's a hut at the foot of the south col.
We'll sleep there tonight and attack the mountain proper tomorrow.
Hello, Truscott.
You must be Miss Pilgrim.
- Yes, that's right.
- Oh, this is Mr. Dewhurst, Sarah... and Mr...
- Brett.
- Brett. Yes.
Do you care for a drink?
I appear to be in the chair.
Wish us bon voyage.
Thank you. I'll have a Campari.
- Truscott?
- Scotch, please.
Campari and another scotch, Hans, please.
Sit down, Sarah.
Your sisters here with you, isn't she?
Klein told us.
- Would she care to join us?
- No, she's having a rest just now.
Quite an occasion for me.
My first climb up a mountain.
Well, yours too, Mr. Brett?
Oh, no.
He's a big voice in the Alpine Club.
How'd you come to take up mountaineering?
Wanted to see if we can't find some good reason for all these accidents.
I'm a geologist, I know all about rock formations and that sort of thing.
Welp, here we are.
Cheers.
- Good Luck.
- To a good climb.
Keep an eye on your roping, won't you.
Why roping, particularly?
- The student business last week.
- That's right, nasty business.
Very nasty.
What was that?
Some kids, climbing on the south col, and one of them fell.
They shouldn't have been climbing without a guide!
Seems he wasn't roped up correctly and the rope got caught up around his neck.
- Strangled him?
- Worse than that.
Tore his head off.
You don't know the half of it.
Tell him what the villagers say, Hans.
It's not for me to...
What do they say, Hans?
Well... the guides who found him, also his friends, they swear the rope was around his waist.
You understand, it was still tied.
But, how could it have...?
The villagers have something to say about that too.
Haven't they, Hans?
Excuse me.
What do the villagers say, Truscott?
They say that it happened before he fell.
As I said, they shouldn't allow inexperienced climbers up the
Trollenberg without a guide.
- There are bound to be accidents.
- Nevertheless, you watch your roping.
We ought to be moving, if we want to make the hut before nightfall.
[German]
Oh, ah, I'm going up to the observatory.
I'll hitch a ride with you in the cable car.
That is, unless you're going to climb the whole way.
Climb the whole way?
Not if I can help it!
See, there are certain chemical changes that can take place inside rock... which cause a physical alteration to its structure.
At times it can become like chalk, break away in hand.
- What do you think of that, Brett?
- Huh?
Oh, I don't think it's like that.
A mountains a mountain.
Some people can climb it and some can't.
Those that can't, shouldn't try.
I'm here under sufferance.
How long do you think it will take you to reach the hut from the observatory?
I don't know.
Oh, about three and half hours.
It's an easy climb.
Professor.
Professor.
How many more times do I tell you?
I'm not to be interrupted.
I'm sorry sir, but there's someone outside to see you.
I don't care. Tell him to go away.
- He says his name is Brooks.
- Tell him to...
- Alan Brooks?
- Yes, sir.
Well, bring him in, bring him in!
No. Wait. Wait.
I bring him in myself.
Alan, my dear Alan.
They all get the sack for leaving you out here. Come in. Come in.
It's good of you to come and see me.
And on your holidays too.
- I was lucky it was in Europe.
You got my letter?
- Yes.
Well, you don't say very much.
What's the matter? You're not pleased to see your old friend?
- [German], professor.
- And how are you, Alan?
Come in. Come in.
Well, Alan, what do you think of our little observatory, huh?
Yes, indeed.
You know, the government gives me as much money as I want.
Come here.
I show you something.
Television?
Better than windows.
Now look.
- Hmm.
- Do you see?
Television cameras on the roof.
We watch everywhere!
You know, the government, the government, they say to me, "Professor, do you have to have such expensive things?
Windows are much cheaper!"
And I say, "I have to have", and I have!
That over there.
That is the only window.
And even for that, we have protection.
Look.
That will stand up to any avalanche.
But that too was very expensive.
All this to study cosmic rays.
Well, Alan, come into my office.
Well, Alan, here we are.
Same old mess, huh?
Well, you're looking very fit.
Fit?
I look the same as always.
Come on, quit your stalling, professor.
You forget I know you.
You said in your letter that it was urgent I see you right away.
What's so urgent?
Well, how long you been here in Trollenberg, Alan?
Got here this morning.
Came right up to see you.
You haven't heard about the accidents then?
Yes, I heard about the students.
Yeah, that was one of them, but... but there have been others.
Many others!
Where people climb mountains there are lots of accidents.
That's true.
And sometimes, the bodies, they disappear.
But here, the search parties go out, and always they find nothing.
Now why is that?
I don't know.
- And then there is the cloud.
- What cloud?
Come on, Alan, you know what I'm talking about.
The cloud where there should be no cloud.
Where there are mountains, there are always clouds.
But this one remains static, on the side of the Trollenberg.
It never moves.
A freak of nature.
A radioactive freak of nature?
- Radioactive?
- Uh huh.
Can we see it from here?
Come, I'll show you.
There you are. On the south side of the Trollenberg.
Alan. Come here.
You see.
Here... here's a map of the area.
This is the Trollenberg.
Now that... that is the scanner.
It's up on the roof here.
Now, you see, at the moment... nothing, no reaction, nothing.
Now remember, here is the cloud.
I turn on the scanner... so.
Now watch when it passes the cloud.
Watch up here on the dials.
Uh huh. Now you see it's past the cloud... nothing.
Watch it go around again.
Watch here.
Well, what do you think of that?
Alan, I ask you to think back 3 years ago, to what happened in the Andes.
- But... but this can't be the same!
- Why not?
We have the accidents like before.
We have the cloud like before.
- Why can't it be the same?
- Too many things missing.
- The mental compulsion...
- What is it?
The girl on the train.
She... she suddenly decided she had to get off at Trollenberg.
She was booked for Geneva.
But she had to get off at Trollenberg!
And did she?
Yes.
She's at the hotel.
There's climbers on the Trollenberg, sir!
Climbers? I thought they were all scared away.
- Where are they?
- 16 degrees west of true north.
2000 meters.
Oh, it's Brett and Dewhurst.
- You know them?
- Just from the hotel.
They came up with me on the cable car.
Well...
They should be all right as long as they stick to their present track.
The cloud is well to the west of the path.
Alan... will you do something about what I've told you?
The cloud? Do what?
Inform the authorities.
Look, I'm on a holiday.
Besides, you haven't told me anything that can be proved.
I've told you about the cloud.
I've told you about the accidents.
What more do you want?
Facts. Proof.
Something that'll look real in black and white on a committee's desk.
Oh no, I'm not gonna stick my neck out again like I did in the Andes.
But why? You were employed by the United Nations.
It was all in the report.
Look, by the time the Andes report was in, there wasn't anything left... in the area, explained or otherwise.
They practically accused me of dreaming the whole thing up.
If I was to take a hand here,
I'd have to have a list... of documented facts and they'd have to be pretty conclusive.
You're an important man.
Why don't you get through to Bern.
Important! I'm only important if
I say something about cosmic rays.
If I say anything else, they tell me to mind my own business.
Maybe... maybe you should speak to Klein.
- The hotel proprietor?
- Well, he's also the mayor of Trollenberg.
Perhaps he could help.
Anyway, he could supply a list of the accidents.
Then perhaps you do something yourself.
You all right?
Take your pack off, man.
You can't relax like that.
Hello?
Yes, Herr Brett.
You're arrived all right!
Good... good.
A nights sleep will set you right.
Yes, all right.
Good-bye.
It was Herr Brett.
They have arrived at the hut.
You see, there's nothing to worry about.
It is just unfortunate that this year we have had many inexperienced climbers.
And what about the rumors in the village?
Well! You know these people, professor.
They are superstitious.
They like to believe in... in fairy stories.
Gentlemen, you understand, officially, there's nothing I can do.
We should be able to make the summit and back tomorrow, if we travel light.
I must have a sack for rock samples.
I think we can manage that.
You can take your sack.
Hmm... visibilities not to good.
- Hope it'll clear.
- Fog? Up here?
No. A cloud, moving down from the peak.
- Will this do, Miss Pilgrim?
- Oh, this'll be fine.
It's quite a collection you have there.
- Now would somebody bring Anne in, please?
- Oh, yes.
Now you'll see that I make no signals to Anne and say nothing.
So it's impossible for any sort of code to be used.
Well done, Alan.
It's a bank note,
French, 500 francs.
There's a number on it.
H...
Oh...
One...
One...
Eight...
Eight!
Well done... very good... ya...
And, who does it belong to, young lady?
- Philip.
- Well done!
It's a rounded sort of object about the size of a tennis ball.
Made of glass.
I think it's used as a paper weight.
There's a model inside it.
A mountain and a little hut.
And when you shake it there's a snow storm.
Snow... mountains... a little hut...
- Two men in the hut.
- Anne!
- Leave her alone.
- The fat one, he's asleep.
Yes, the fat one, he's asleep.
But he's not the one.
It's the other one, sitting at a table, smoking, writing in a book.
He's the one.
He's getting up, he's coming toward the door.
He's reached the door.
He's opening it.
He's coming out.
Up the slope.
Up the slope!
Walking slowly!
No...
Mountains...
Paperweight.
Glass paperweight.
- Please, don't crowd.
- Take her up to her room.
- Hello.
- Hello, Brett?
- Dewhurst here. What do you want?
- Are you all right?
Yes, why?
- Is Brett there?
- Of course he is.
Wouldn't go wandering off in the middle of the night...
Just a minute... hold on.
Dewhurst!
Dewhurst, is Brett there?
Can you hear me? Dewhurst?
Are you there?
Hello? Hello?
Hello? You're right, he's not here.
He must have just gone out.
I better go and look for him.
No, don't do that.
You'll be lost in 5 seconds.
Just sit tight where you are.
I think I should go. There may be something wrong.
No! You're not to move.
Stay in the hut!
- What's the weather like?
- Not very good.
Some heavy cloud coming down.
Well then, stay where you are, there'll be somebody at this end of the phone all night.
If Brett show up, or if you need us, ring us here, will you?
All right. Bye.
Bye.
Brett!
Brett!
[Echoes]
She's coming around, I think.
- Where am I? What happened?
- It's all right, darling.
You passed out.
Now we need something to relax you sister.
A sedative, perhaps?
You have such a thing?
I may have some sleeping pills in my room. Shall I see if I can find them?
Oh, please.
Thank you.
Sarah, could I speak with you for a minute, please?
All right.
I shan't be a minute.
Now, Miss Sarah, I don't want you to upset yourself...
Are these any good?
Oh.
Yes, that's fine.
Now, you give her 2 of these, then come downstairs, please.
All right.
So Mr. Brett decides to take a walk.
- That is not so strange.
- Hope you're right.
How is she?
Well, she'll be all right, I think.
- Did you get through to the hut?
- Yes.
Brett isn't there.
Did you notice how she said... he was coming out of the hut, coming up the mountain side?
It was as though she was watching from on the Trollenberg itself.
Well, Miss Sarah, I wanted to ask you something.
This act of yours, you've been doing it for how long?
About 2 years now.
You don't use a code, do you?
Well, we used to.
And hen we found that Anne could guess what I was thinking before I started speaking.
- But I don't see what this has got to do...
- Please, please...
Your sister's telepathic, no?
Yes, she is.
- I wanted to give up the act.
- Why?
Well, you saw what happened tonight.
It's a dreadful mental strain.
That's really why we're taking this holiday.
Nevertheless, you will take her away from here first thing tomorrow, please.
Take her aw... But why?!
It's not good for her here.
You will take her away first thing in the morning, all right?
If you say so.
Good.
Hello?
Yes.
Yes, he's here.
It's for you, professor.
Thank you.
Hello.
- Hello, Crevett here.
- Professor?
I thought I'd better contact you.
That cloud has started moving.
Yes. It's variation is about 6 degrees.
Radioactivity increasing.
The radioactivity is increasing too, sir.
Wait a minute and I'll find out.
Yes.
Yes, I understand.
I'll be up in the morning.
The cloud has moved.
It is at the foot of the south col.
Where the hut is!
Hello!
Oh, hello Alan.
No, no sign of him yet.
It's foggy as hell outside.
Anyway, I can't see far.
Perishing cold too.
Yes.
Yes.
Hold on a minute.
There's someone outside.
Hang on.
Brett?
Brett, is that you?
False alarm, I guess.
Hang on a minute, I'm just gonna close the door.
Dewhurst, can you hear me?
Dewhurst?
Dewhurst? Hello? Hello?
Dewhurst?
Well?
The phones gone dead.
Hello.
Yes, speaking.
Yes...
I see.
All right.
All right.
It was the observatory.
The cloud has moved away from the hut.
Back up the Trollenberg.
[SPEAKS GERMAN]
We better start now.
It will be light soon.
[SPEAKS GERMAN]
I though the locals were afraid of going up that mountain.
They are afraid.
It's an unwritten law here.
At a time like this, they go up, no matter what.
I have called a spotter plane, but it will not be up until morning.
We will be well on our way by then.
Ready?
- All right, Herr Klein.
- Good.
Look after yourself, Alan.
Don't worry.
I'll stop by the observatory on the way down.
Good.
Be careful everyone.
Here they come.
Professor?
Here they come.
Men,
They're climbing the ledge.
They'll be here soon.
Soon they'll be at the hut.
Keep them away.
Keep them away from the hut.
Away from the hut!
Away from the hut!
Professor?
What's the matter?
Why does she behave like this?
Well...
Well, it's...
It's like a radio receiver.
You see... your sister's mind is capable of receiving signals sent out by other minds, by yours for example.
Now... now there is a stronger signal,
I think, a stronger mind.
It's jamming the wavelength.
But who is it?
Well, we shall know more about that, I think, when they reach the hut.
In the meantime, I say to you again, get your sister out of here before it is too late.
Too late for what?
Well, it's time I was getting back to the observatory.
Too late for what, professor?
When they reach the hut, then we shall know for sure, I think.
The door's locked from the inside.
They must be there.
Mr. Brett! Mr. Dewhurst!
I just looked in through the window.
The place seems deserted.
Philip.
Come here.
These blankets... frozen stiff.
Where are they?
That door was barred on the inside.
- Yeah...
- Herr Brooks!
[SPEAKS GERMAN]
It's Dewhurst.
His head's been torn off.
Anne, we're leaving here today.
No, Sarah.
But Anne, why not?
Look, after last night...
I just want to stay here, that's all.
Now, Anne, I really mean this!
We're leaving Trollenberg today!
All right?
All right.
Now, don't you worry about anything at all.
And I'll go and fix things up.
[SPEAKS GERMAN]
You know these mountains, Herr Klein.
What do you think of our chances of finding him?
Herr Brett is an experienced climber so we can only assume that he's hurt.
[Indistinct] ...the spotter plane should be here any minute.
[SPEAKS GERMAN]
Hey, Alan.
This is why the telephone went dead.
The wires are broken.
What do you make of it?
Never seen that happen before.
I have.
I saw some experiments with excessive cold once.
If wire like this is subjected to sufficient cold, it crystallizes, the structure breaks down.
- Just like this here.
- It hasn't been cold!
- Not cold enough for this.
- Yeah, I know it.
Spotter.
Plane to party. Plane to party.
Are you receiving me?
Are you receiving me?
Party to plane.
Receiving you loud and clear.
What is your position?
What is your position?
Our position: map reference 2-6-5-8-4-3.
Over.
Roger, party. I can see you now.
I shall fly north for 5 miles, then turn west for 5 miles,
- then south.
- Uh huh.
- I shall cover this search area first.
- Roger, plane!
Anne, I...
Hello?
Hello, I want to speak to the observatory,
Professor Crevett.
Hello, party. This is the plane.
I have spotted him.
I have spotted him.
He's approximately half a mile due north of your position.
- Above the north face.
- Roger, plane.
Miss Pilgrim, my name's Wilde.
Professor Crevett sent me to bring you to the observatory.
But I'm not to go to the observatory.
Well, there's nowhere else to go.
It's only a couple hundred yards.
I'm to go up the mountain.
I don't think so, Miss Pilgrim.
I think you ought to wait a while at the observatory.
[SPEAKS GERMAN]
Herr Brett! [Echoes]
[SPEAKS GERMAN]
Swing it 30 degrees west.
- How about that?
- Negative.
- Hugo?
- Negative.
Swing another 30 degrees.
Negative.
Negative.
Try the other circuit.
No. Wait.
Switch back to the first circuit and reverse the scanner.
Now...
Well, hello Anne.
What are you doing up here?
I must go.
- Please excuse me.
- Go? Go where?
To the Trollenberg.
I must go, now.
- Don't let her go, sir.
- Don't worry.
Come along.
Oh, good.
- Alan, I want to speak with you.
- Yeah, I've got news for you too.
Hans, when's the next cable car go down the mountain?
- It shouldn't be long, sir.
- Good. I...
I want you to take Anne down.
Don't let her out of your sight.
Anne, I want you to go with Hans.
He'll take care of you.
Thank you, Hans.
- Well, I've been to the hut.
- And?
Dewhurst is dead.
Brett's missing.
Not that I'm surprised, mind you.
The cloud has started moving again.
What cloud?
Oh, I don't think you'd understand, Philip.
Like that time in the
Andes, do you mean?
How do you know about that?
All right, I'm a newspaper man.
It's my job to know about these things.
I see.
I chased that story when we got a wind of your report, Alan.
When I got there it was too late.
Looks as if I'm going to be more fortunate this time, doesn't it?
Yeah. Fine. Fine. That's... that's just what we need.
You haven't answered my question, professor.
- What question?
- Is this the same as it was then?
Seems to be.
So what happens now?
The United Nations have a special team for investigating phenomenon.
I call them in.
Does the... theory that you put forward last time still hold, professor?
What theory?
Visitors from outer space.
That was it, wasn't it?
- Well, what else?
- Well, what are they?
What do they want?
Look, Philip, there are many galaxies besides ours.
Now, who knows what is happening millions of miles out in space.
Perhaps the world that these creatures inhabit is coming to an end.
Perhaps the need to find somewhere else to live.
- Well why pick on us?
- We don't know it's just us.
Maybe it's also Mars, Venus, Jupiter.
Who can tell?
Do you go along with this?
Until someone comes up with a better theory...
Yes... yes I do.
All right.
All right, while we're theorizing...
Why, do you think, do they always happen to land on the tops of mountains?
First the Andes, and now the Trollenberg.
Well, it's the atmosphere, I think.
You see, it gets much thinner high up.
Well, perhaps these creatures need that.
The cloud would seem to indicate this too.
Creating their own atmosphere.
Well, if they can only exist on the tops of mountains they're hardly likely to inherit the earth, are they?
You see, anyone can get used to anything, in time.
Now these movements we have recorded here, each time lower down the mountain.
Acclimatization perhaps?
What next, professor?
The next move is up to you, Alan.
You must inform the authorities!
Have you seen the professor?
He's in the office with Alan Brooks.
They're telephoning Zurich.
Any sign of Mr. Brett yet?
Well, the plane spotted someone he thought was him, and 2 of the searchers went to meet him.
The others are back.
They saw nothing.
Well, if it was Brett, they aught to be back by now.
- Where's your sister?
- She's in her room.
Good.
You think she's safe from our "friends" up there?
Well, I don't think they'll try the same thing again.
Trouble is... what will they try?
Herr Brett... you all right?
A bit tired, otherwise all right.
Where have you been?
We had search parties out for you.
I was lost.
- Dewhurst get back all right?
- When did you see him last?
- Dewhurst?
- Yes.
- Last night I saw him.
- At the hut?
Yes, at the hut.
It's a bit hot in here.
Pour me a drink, Klein.
Have one on me.
- Let me help you.
- Sorry.
Thank you.
- How's your sister, Miss Pilgrim?
- She's all right now.
Where is she?
- She's in...
- Here... have a cigarette.
Bit nervous, I'm afraid.
Pretty scary up there on your own.
Were you all on your own?
After I lost Dewhurst.
I'm sorry to be a nuisance, but may...
Look at his head.
There's no blood.
That should take care of him until the morning, I think.
Good.
The UNO team will be here tomorrow and Dr. Frekard can have a look at him.
Do we tell the others what he was trying to do?
I don't know.
I don't know about you, but I could use a drink.
Alan, what is this all about?
Brett behaving like that, I mean.
You read the Andes report.
Don't you know?
Do you mean to say something like this has happened before?
Oh, that part of the report was hushed up.
There was an old woman down there.
She was clairvoyant.
The villagers thought she was a witch.
Actually, it was case of more than ordinary sensory powers.
Crevett was able to hypnotize her.
She was remarkably sensitive to outside suggestion.
You know, mental suggestion.
Under hypnosis, one can tell these things.
Well... it was about the same time as we first observed the cloud.
She started having these trances.
It was a though some mental compulsion was working on her.
She began seeing things.
We planned a course of hypnosis to try and find where these compulsions were coming from, but... we never did start it.
There was a man... he went up the mountain.
He'd been missing for 24 hours and then he came down.
His co-ordinations were not quite right.
Just like Brett.
The first opportunity he got, he took a meat axe to the old woman.
We got there about
10 minutes later.
Both dead.
How did the man die?
Crevett...
The man had been dead already 24 hours.
I know, I know, it's impossible, of course.
But you see, there are certain changes which take place in the body after death.
They follow a pattern that can not be altered.
The man had been dead already,
24 hours. There was no doubt!
I was unfortunately unable to perform the autopsy.
The police took over.
Are you trying to tell me that Brett is like that?
That... we've just been fighting a... dead man?
We believe that he was sent down that mountain by... whatever's up there, for the express purpose of killing Anne Pilgrim.
They can't afford for
Anne to be alive.
She's a threat to their security.
They tried to entice her up there.
Now they've tried this.
- Neither's worked.
- So what do they try now?
I don't know.
- Professor?
- I don't know, either.
But whatever it is, we won't have to wait long to find out.
Alan!
Alan!
Alan!
Oh, Alan!
Alan!
Wake up! Please!
Alan! Please!
Alan!
Alan! Come quickly!
Alan!
- Alan, look at this.
- What?
Hans, bring the light closer.
Now put it lower. Lower.
Put it on the floor.
You see the way the flesh reflects the light?
It's almost as though it was crystallized.
Like meat that's been deep frozen.
I still don't understand how such a...
Alan, the observatory's just been on...
That clouds moving again.
It's coming down the Trollenberg, towards the village.
Hans, I've told you, you're wasting your time. That phone is dead.
The wires have been cut.
- We gotta get up to the observatory.
- But we must...
You heard what the professor said.
That place is built like a fort.
If we're going to have any direct contact with these things, at least we'll have some kind of chance up there.
It's insane!
We should try to get out...
- to the valley!
- The road is blocked. The cloud stretches right across it.
Alan?
- We'd better get moving, eh?
- Yes. Yes. You.. you go in the next cable car with the girls.
- You got everyone?
- Nearly everyone.
Got 12 left.
One has all ready gone up and the other one will be down in 10 minutes.
- Who is that?
- It's Hans.
All right everybody, let's get up to the cable car as quickly as we can.
We haven't got very much time.
- Got everything, Philip?
- Yep.
- Hey, what about Hans?
- He's driving through that cloud!
Professor, are you sure we're doing the right thing, coming up to your observatory?
Right or wrong?
I don't know.
What I do know is it's wrong to stay down in the village.
Up there, we stand some chance, at least.
Professor, look, on the lower slopes, the cloud!
It's moving faster.
I hope they see it down there.
The operator says it is 5 minutes now.
Good.
Alan!
The clouds moving pretty fast now.
Please folks, I'd like for you all to be ready to load in the car as soon as it gets down.
We haven't got a second to spare.
It's nearly at the hotel.
If only we could see into that cloud at least we'd know what we were dealing with.
Well, we'll know soon enough.
It seems to have stopped at the hotel.
Yeah, well, as long as it stays there, we're all right.
At least that cloud lets us see where it moves.
Let's get aboard as quickly as possible, please.
That's it.
Hurry along.
Please, ma'am, please.
[SPEAKS GERMAN]
Of course... the child!
If that cloud starts to move this way before I get back, take the car up, understand?
- What about you?
- Do as you're told!
Stay!
[SPEAKS GERMAN]
Tell her that Mr...
All right, let's get in the cable car.
That's it.
- That was a close shave.
- It was.
We're not through yet.
Remember the telephone wires at the hut?
Yeah.
This contraption operate in extreme cold?
- We work the cable car at 30 below.
- Colder than that?
It never gets colder than that.
The cable, it will snap!
All right, quick, everybody out!
That's it.
We're leaving the villagers out here, sir. It's just as safe, and they won't get in the way.
- Are the radios still working?
- We checked it about 15 minutes ago.
Oh, Alan, come here.
- Alan, we are in big trouble.
- What now?
- The cloud is splitting up..,
- Splitting up?!
There are 4 of them now.
And all moving this way.
- How long before they get here?
- An hour, maybe.
Then we've got just an hour to decide what we're gonna do.
Better check that radio again.
- You're going to signal the authorities?
- To tell them what?!
What do you use against these things?
- High explosives?
- Bombs?
The time the plane get here, those things will be all over us.
How do they drop their bombs then?
- Sets still working OK, sir.
- Good.
Let me see that thing again.
There's someone knocking at the outside door, Herr Wilde.
- It's Hans, from the hotel.
- I'll let him in.
There are 5 of them now.
And all moving.
Well, if we don't make up our minds pretty soon, they'll be made up for us.
Hans, what's the matter?
What happened?
The cloud, it was straight across the road.
I turned the car and came back.
You all right?
Yes.
I'm all right.
Thank you.
It is so hot in here!
Stay here with the others, Hans.
You'll be all right soon.
Thank you.
[SPEAKS GERMAN]
I know it's a lot to ask, Sarah, but I don't see any other way.
Anne, where're you going?
- I'm just going to sit down in the office.
- All right.
But how can Anne help?
She doesn't know anything.
We don't for sure that she can. But Sarah, we've got to try something.
Obviously, she has some kind of contact with these things, whether she know it of not.
I thought perhaps with you controlling her thinking, we... we might be able to learn something about what we're dealing with.
I suppose we could try.
Professor, it's the thermometer on the south col, it's going down all the time.
- It's 45 below.
- And still dropping.
- It's a cloud location, isn't it?
- There is a cloud there, yes.
Wait a minute.
Say it's cold they need.
They live in cold. Remember the phone wires at the hut?
And Brett complained of being hot after he was infected.
- Yes.
- And Hans too, he complained of the heat.
Supposing that...
Hans? What about him?
He arrived a few moments ago, said he changed his mind about trying to escape. He complained...
- Where is he?!
- Out in the corridor.
- Where's Hans?
- He went inside a minute ago.
- He came in here.
- Well, where can he... Anne!
No, Sarah, no!
Wait, my dear, please.
Poor devil.
- Anne!
- She'll be all right, I think.
Wilde. Better take care of him.
How thick are these walls?
- I don't know, 2, 3 feet, maybe.
- Fireproof?
Well, yes, they're reinforced concrete against the avalanche.
Good. Hugo, get on the radio,
United Nations in Bern. I want to talk to Colonel Spellman.
Now that Anne can't help us anymore, there's only one thing left.
- What's that?
- What I said before.
Every time we've come up against these things there's been this intense cold.
Remember you said that Brett looked like he'd been in a deep freeze.
Heat! That's what we've got to use.
I'm going to ask for a bombing raid.
- You said that was impossible.
- Fire bombs, that's our answer.
Through to Bern, Mr. Brooks.
- Got any petrol?
- Yes.
Fine. Get it. And all the jars and bottles you've got.
I think a bit more in that one.
That's fine.
Be sure and get that rag stuffed in there tight so the petrol won't leak.
May I have your attention, please?
I don't want anyone to leave this corridor unless I say so. Understood?
In the meantime, get as many of these ready as you can, and be careful of them, they're dangerous.
And I can tell you that help's on its way. Thank you.
- Alan?
- Yeah?
How we gonna use these "bombs" of yours?
You light the rags and throw them at those things in the cloud.
Alan, come here, quickly.
Look at this.
- Cute little things, aren't they?
- Yeah.
I'm gonna throw a bomb at that one. You watch on the screen and see what happens.
Would you all go up to the far end of the corridor, please?
Except you, you come with me.
I want you to slam this door behind me and wait for me to knock to come back in.
If I don't knock, don't open it, right?
All right.
Get me a couple more of those bottles.
- I saw it on the screen.
- Those things can really move.
We really got to get a direct hit or surround them with so much flame they can't get out.
- Let me try one.
- All right.
Alan, there's one on the roof!
It's taken Philip!
Thanks.
- You all right?
- Yes.
Thank, Alan.
- Now what?
- I don't know.
We can't go out that door again, that's for sure.
It's the only way in or out of this observatory, I've checked.
No more bombs then.
Not these.
- Well, what do we do then?
- I don't know.
There's nothing much we can do, but wait for that airplane.
What are they doing now?
- Can't tell anymore. They block out the cameras, you see?
- Yeah.
Jolly Roger to observatory.
Jolly Roger to observatory.
Receiving you loud and clear.
ETA in 5 minutes. Over.
Mr. Brooks, I'm through to the plane.
He says ETA in about 5 minutes.
Good. Tell him to make a straight run over the observatory and drop his bombs on the roof.
I hope he knows what he's doing.
Hello, Jolly Roger.
- Hello, Jolly Roger.
- Jolly Roger to observatory...
- No change?
- None.
Repeat. Waiting your instructions.
Over.
Hello, observatory. I can just make you out through a great deal of low hanging cloud. Over.
Tell him to bomb the cloud.
Hello, Jolly Roger.
Drop first stick across observatory and cloud. Understand?
Bomb the cloud as well.
Over.
Wilco, observatory. Sounds crazy to me, bombing a cloud. Over.
- Do as you're told! Over.
- Yes, sir. Out.
Stand by, everyone.
The target is that cloud.
I'm going in to take another look.
Now all we can hope is these wall will stand the heat of those bombs.
Well, we shall know soon enough.
I'm gonna try a high level attack first.
Here we go.
Steady.
Steady.
To your right.
Visual on.
Steady.
Bombs away.
Standby for low level attack.
Oh, Wilde, tell the villagers they can go down the mountain any time they'd like.
Yes, sir.
How about a breath of fresh air?
- I'd love a breath of fresh air.
- Come on.
Well, Sarah, doesn't look as though you'll have to worry about her any longer.
- No, it doesn't.
- Cigarette?
Well, Alan, for the first time in weeks, the Trollenberg is free from cloud.
Yes, and let's hope it stays that way!
Created with VisualSubSync and Subtitle Edit.
    - You know who that was?
    - No.
             Major Lincoln Bond.
I wonder what he's doin' back here.
                       I wonder.
   Edwards to General Banner,
   I can see it again.
     It looks like the fire
     is back to the wing.
'Roger, Edwards.
I can see it now in my mirror.'
  'I'm reducing power
  to idle position. Stand by.'
     General, this Mickey McKee.
 I don't see any fire now.
 Is your warning light still on?
   'Affirmative, Mickey,
   no fire in the mirror now'
    'but the warning light's
    still on.'
'I'm stop-cocking the throttle, and comin' in.'
 Okay, we'll be all set for you.
     I want crash trucks
     at both ends of the runway.
  Calling Crash Control,
  we have an F-102 in trouble.
  Give us equipment
  at both ends of the runway.
  You got fire again, general.
  Don't try to land, bail out.
      'Relax, Mickey,
      we'll never locate'
     'the cause of the fire
     that way.'
  'If I can't make the runway,
  I'll land on the dry lake.'
Don't try it, she may get worse.
Get out while you can.
   'Negative, I'm coming in.'
I'm sorry, Lt. Sweeney, but only the rescue party is allowed in the crash area.
It's still dangerous, ma'am.
        - You too, sir.
        - Okay, captain.
            Mm-hmm. Yeah, I see.
   Oh, what's his condition now?
   Hmm, good.
What about the plane, any report come through on it yet?
               What do you know,
               it's Major Bond.
   - Welcome back to Edwards.
   - Thanks, Jerry.
Just visiting.
    - What'll you have, sir?
    - Scotch on the rocks.
                      Coming up.
                      How is he?
 Hospital says he's okay.
 He'll be back at work tomorrow.
          I was afraid this time
          he'd had it.
     Excuse me.
     Major Bond, meet Major Lee.
Bromo Lee?
I've heard about you.
     I've heard about you.
  I saw the general coming in.
With that much fire, you'd have thought he'd have bailed out.
   Looks like you don't know
   General Banner.
  He's allergic to abandoning
  any aircraft..
    ...if it's still flying.
    Well, it's getting late.
          - Goodnight.
          - 'Night.
Bromo's been making quite a name for himself with those speed and altitude records.
               Oh, I don't know.
      Always figure we got
      other pilots just as good.
         But he rates number one
         with General Banner.
      'There's no question
      about that.'
           Tell me..
...the general still doing a lot of tests, like the one tonight?
  Are you kiddin'?
  He flies more than his pilots.
      Especially the tough ones.
That's what I hear.
     Mickey.
   You should know better, Linc,
   this is no way to do things.
Well, maybe I should've come in through the back door.
             The idea is to give
             a little notice.
 Why, we have a band that jumps
 at any excuse to start playing.
They'd need a better excuse than me.
                 Sit down, Linc.
Well, since you having made general obviously, you've been doing something else with your time.
               Well, I just had
               another daughter.
All by yourself?
        No, there was some woman
        around at the time
           by the name of Sarah,
           I think.
I think so too.
How is she?
    They're all wonderful, Linc.
   Well, you didn't come
   all this way just to find out
         that we're loaded
         with kids at our house.
 Mainly, I came all this way
 to get away from where I was.
           Washington? I thought
           that's the place
       where everything happens.
  Not any of the things
  that I know anything about.
 You know why I'm here, Mickey.
   I want a job test flying.
         Yeah, I know.
  And I know all the questions
  you've got to ask
     before you can give me
     any sort of an answer.
   First, "Am I alright now?"
            Are you?
           I'm fine.
     All I need is a job
     that I know I can do.
  I know what a spot
  it's putting you in to ask.
         That doesn't bother me.
          The only thing
          that really matters is
             are you sure
             you're alright now?
      'Maybe you need
      a little more time.'
           I'm okay.
                    I don't have
                    to tell you
           if it were up to me
           you'd already be set.
  It goes without saying that
  I'll put in a request for you.
    Then it's up to the general.
Banner?
Is he everything they say he is?
     He's a real good man, Linc.
What's his attitude going to be about me?
                 Let's find out.
                 Come on.
    Hi, Connie. Any chance of
    seeing the man for a minute?
 Probably. You're ranked pretty
 high around here, you know.
'Yes?'
     Col. McKee would like
     to see you, general.
        - 'Send him in.'
        - Yes, sir.
See how easy it is when you're ranked pretty high?
       'Thanks, Connie.'
Oh, by the way..
I think this is what
Sarah means when she says
I'm always putting my foot in my mouth.
Anyway, there's a guy outside
I think you used to know.
  I used to know lots of guys.
That's what I mean.
So, you probably know this one.
         Linc.
                  Hello, Connie.
This is a fine thing to do to a girl.
             Well, I didn't know
             you were here.
 - Last time I heard you were--
 - I was in dating.
That was quite a while ago, Linc.
                Yes, yes it was.
General Banner requested me here about a year ago.
                             Oh.
You would've known all this if
I hadn't started feeling silly about all those letters
I was writing and never getting any answers.
           Yeah, well, it wasn't
           that exactly, I--
Lots of time can pass before you even know it.
                           Yeah.
            Well, all in all,
            wouldn't you say I..
  ...look a lot younger
  than you've ever seen me look?
I was thinking that but...
I couldn't find just the words.
Good Ol' Linc... he can always tell when a girl's about to go completely to pieces.
I haven't even asked you what you're doing here.
                Well, I'm trying
                to get a job
     which no one seems to think
     I have a chance of getting.
You'll never know until you ask.
           Well, it used to be..
           knew before I asked.
              Well, things have
              a way of changing.
Don't they just?
          Connie, how about
          having dinner tonight?
I'd like to, but..
I'm afraid I'm going to have to work tonight, Linc.
     Well, couldn't you tell him
   that a ghost out of your past
   showed up unexpectedly?
The general is a man who doesn't believe in ghosts.
But if you're going to be around for a few days..
         Not if the news is bad.
Well, I better be getting back to my desk.
Oh.
         Connie, isn't there
         something you could do?
        I mean about the dinner.
I'm afraid not, Linc.
If I'd had any warning..
...but of course you didn't know I was here.
Goodbye, Linc.
  But, general, I wouldn't be
  asking you to assign Bond if..
 Look, he wasn't a collaborator.
         Oh, wasn't he?
 A confession he made to
 the Chinese about germ warfare
      sounded a lot like
      collaboration to me.
     Alright, so he signed
     a piece of paper.
 But not until he'd held out
 for 14 months of brainwashing
       and gone through..
     Hell, who knows
     what they go through.
              But more important
              than anything..
     ...before he went to Korea,
     he was turning into
        the most promising pilot
        I'd ever run across.
          He had natural ability
          and judgment.
  And what you need more
  than anything else right now..
                   ..experience.
What I need more than anything else right now is pilots I know I can count on under stress.
I'm sorry, Mickey, that doesn't sound like Bond to me.
           But who knows how bad
           the stress got?
           Maybe nobody could've
           taken it any longer.
Maybe.
   He tried to kill himself by
   slashing his wrist, you know.
     We turn down good men
     every week.
  How can you ask me to lower
  that standard for Bond?
 Bond met those standards when
 he came here originally, sir.
     There's no use
     trying to convince me.
     It doesn't matter
     how I feel personally.
 What matters is, that I have
 pilots I know I can count on.
  With Bond, I wouldn't know.
   That's all there is to it.
Believe me, it's a rotten decision to make.
 It looks as though
 I was giving him a final kick.
It  wi be the final kick, sir.
      If it is, I'm sorry.
 That doesn't change anything.
                Well, it looks
                as if we've won.
           Maybe full production
           on the XF-120.
  Great. It's about time too.
        I gotta go fly.
Well, you're in the right branch of the service for it, general.
Never without a word on the subject, these civilians.
      You were right.
      I used to know him.
I was sure I had the right girl.
    Oh, general...I'd like
    you to meet Major Bond, sir.
    - General Banner.
    - Glad to meet you, sir.
Haven't I seen you before?
      I don't believe we've met.
Thanks for trying to pry me out of there last night.
             Well, sir, I wasn't
             doing much good.
                 The rescue boys
                 got you out.
About your request, Bond
I'm afraid I'll have to turn you down, I'm sorry.
Too bad you had to come all the way out here.
           It meant a lot to me.
Look, if you'd be interested in anything else around here except test flying..
- That's nice of you. sir.
- You let McKee know if you are.
Where are you staying?
        I piled in last night
        on Joe and Polly Craven.
   From all the fuss you'd think
   they were glad to see me.
   - Great actors, those two.
   - Yeah.
In our theater group they don't come any better than Joe and Polly.
    - When are you leaving?
    - Tomorrow morning.
      In case you don't know it,
      I'm having dinner tonight
                with the Cravens
                and the McKees.
      Thanks, Mickey,
      I know how hard you tried.
See you later.
  Well, you know what
  it was like during the war.
       No place to eat,
       no place to park.
   Luckily, of course, we had
   only two children then.
Only two..
Sounds like a whole gang to me.
      Believe me, Linc,
      two children aren't enough
           to completely destroy
           a large house.
         Stick around a few days
         and you'll see.
    Absolutely, Linc, and you're
    not gonna leave tomorrow.
    You just can't do things
    like that.
    Just pop in after
    who knows how many years
    then turn right around
    and pop right off again.
  Before anyone's had a chance
  to get used to you again.
Now, why would you want me and my long sad face around?
It may be long and sad, but it's a familiar face.
    Andf I think old friends
    are the best friends.
            She didn't read that
            any place.
       She made it up
       on the spur of the moment
         just for this argument.
You better watch yourself, pal.
This is the kind you wind up marrying.
          Don't worry,
          I'll keep my guard up.
       Don't you agree?
       If he did marry me
               it'd be nice
               for the children.
'Don't worry, you'll find out.'
       Not at this rate,
       I won't.
    Connie told me
    she was working tonight.
  So what? It's already 10:30,
  they worked until ten
    and then Connie dragged
    the general down here
  for a little Saturday night
  relaxation.
   You know, I think I'll ask
   that girl for a dance.
                      Uh, Linc..
Nothing, I was just gonna wish you luck.
            Thanks.
   - Why didn't you tell him?
   - Why didn't you?
  There's nothing for anybody
  to tell anybody.
    He's just gonna ask her
    for a dance, isn't he?
      - Evening, general.
      - Good evening.
      How are you, Connie?
I was afraid you'd take off before
I had a chance to see you again.
    You've heard of
    the perennial bad penny.
 And I hope, sir, you've
 heard of the universal custom
    of asking an attractive
    young lady to dance.
                  Oh, I've heard
                  of it alright.
     I can't say that I
     particularly approve of it.
             But if it's alright
             with her, major.
It's alright with me.
        Thank you, sir.
        You know, a lonely major
        can find himself
     flying with his wings
     cut off
  by making a pass
  at the general's girfriend.
          It isn't that exactly.
But it is something.
      Well, we've been going out
      quite a bit together
      and you know how
      those things are built up.
      How serious is it, Connie?
       If somebody asked me that
       yesterday, I..
...would have said pretty serious.
       - What's changed?
       - Stop it, Linc.
              You know very well
              what's changed.
            You don't sound
            very happy about it.
                   Why should I?
             What's there to be
             happy about finding
         you still get disturbed
         about someone
      who hasn't even given you
      a thought for over a year?
  - You know better than that.
  - How?
  That big stack of letters from
  you that I treasure so much?
        Like old times,
        isn't it?
    I don't think it's much
    like old times, do you?
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
I certainly didn't mean to disturb you but there's been trouble at the rocket testing station and I--
         Alright, Sweeney,
         pull yourself together.
        - I'm leaving right now.
        - Oh, yes, sir.
   - So, you're at it again.
   - Oh, it isn't my fault.
    Being a general's aid's
    a lousy position to be.
  I-I-I didn't mean that, sir.
     It was an unfortunate
     choice of words--
   - Alright, Sweeney.
   - I'll go with you, Bill.
 No, it's early, you stay here
 and have a little fun.
    You can bum a ride with
    the McKee's or someone
       I'll see that she
       gets home, sir.
       Yes, the major
       can see you home.
       Thank you, major.
      - Alright, Sweeney.
      - Yes, sir.
       Why don't we leave
       by the front door?
Thank you, sir.
       - Goodnight.
       - Goodnight, sir.
But at least somebody's on my side.
               Just pray that
               it isn't Sweeney.
Why won't you tell me about Korea?
    Honestly, Connie, I'd rather
    tell you about it
         than anybody else but..
      ...it'd be like two people
      trying to communicate
   with each other,
   each in a different language.
            I just don't think
            you'd understand me.
Alright, then let's forget it.
From now on, if anybody asks you anything you tell them to check with me.
     I don't want a whole lot of
     people checking with you.
              If it's scars
              you're looking for
                I've got some
                worse than that.
I just wanna be sure they're all healed.
Gone as far along toward healing as they can without some help.
What kind of help, Linc?
    I need somebody to show
    some confidence in me again.
      Believe me, I never needed
      anything so desperately
               in my whole life.
            What it amounts to..
                ...I guess, is..
  ...starting from scratch and
  selling myself all over again.
   Ever try to sell something
   that nobody wanted to buy?
         - Connie, I--
         - Don't, Linc.
           - Why not?
           - Why not?
 Linc, you can't just wander
 back here after all these time
    and pick up right where
    you left off.
You're not the only one that things have happened to since you've been gone.
And believe me, you're not the only one who's been hurt.
You hurt me bad, Linc, real bad.
Taking me in your arms isn't going to help me forget it.
                        Connie..
You talk about needing someone to show some confidence in you..
Why couldn't you have shown a little in me?
Didn't you know that no matter how cut up you were mentally or physically, you could've come right back to me and that's all
I would've cared about.
   Perhaps I needed some time
   to pull myself back together.
I didn't want you all together.
I wanted you all the pieces.
So I could show you how much I loved you by helping you get back.
'I'll try to make it brief, sir.'
  'I'd like to quote something
  you said in a speech once.'
You said that the most important requirement of a test pilot
      is the desire to be
      a test pilot.
No doubt about it.
       Well, that I've got, sir.
           And I think my record
           will back me up.
         Then you went on to say
         that the second-most
           important requirement
           is stability.
That's right.
And since you brought up your record, I..
Go ahead, major.
   Well, sir, unfortunately,
   at this point
    the only way I can prove
    my stability
      is for somebody
      to let me prove it.
      Also, unfortunately
   nobody who's in a position
   to let you prove it
   could possibly ignore
   everything on your record.
    No, sir, they couldn't.
  The only reason that I'm
  taking up more of your time
    is to try to impress you
    with my complete desire
      to be a test pilot.
  In regards to my stability,
  I..
    ...I think I'm qualified
    there again, sir.
    I'm sorry but the answer
    is still no.
Alright, sir, may I take you up on your offer of last Saturday?
         Some other job
         on the base?
   You didn't seem
   very interested Saturday.
       What made you
       change your mind?
    Well, when it came time
    to leave, I..
   I realized that even if
   I couldn't do test-flying
  I'd still like to be around
  where it's being done.
     I'm afraid I've gotta
     say no to that too
       because it,
       it wouldn't work.
        And I quote you
        right back..
  You mentioned your complete
  desire to be a test pilot.
    We both know that there
    isn't any substitute.
 But maybe there's another way,
 a better way.
 Nobody knows all the answers,
 least of all, me.
But I do know some testing procedure.
Suppose you have to determine the stability of an experimental aeroplane, how would you proceed?
    I'd work up to it, sir,
    step by step.
   Exactly.
   You nibble at the problem.
  Now, on that basis
  I'm going to change my mind.
     I'll go along with you
     for that first step.
  I'm willing to re-assign you
  as a test pilot.
But you'll be limited to chase and pace.
None of the major projects.
   - I understand, sir.
   - Alright, it's up to you.
      Yes, sir.
      Thank you, general.
           - Bill..
           - General.
     Senator, may I present
     General Bill Banner
     he runs the show here.
  I've been hearing about you
  for years, Banner.
  Thank you, sir, I hope
  you had a comfortable trip.
     Very smooth. General Shelby
     is a good pilot.
      Don't tell me you finally
      broke down and got an aid.
    Yes, sir.
    Gentlemen, Lt. Sweeney.
Lieutenant.
    Isn't that Lincoln Bond?
'Yes, Bromo's checking him out on the XF-120.'
- How long has he been here now?
- Little over two months.
I was surprised when you took him here.
       - How's he doing?
       - Alright so far.
That about covers it.
And remember she's got a high rate of sink.
Your first landing, come in flat with plenty of power.
 - Hard to judge the flare out.
 - Roger Wilco.
And try to bring it back in one large attractive piece, huh?
         I'll bend every effort.
       - All checked out?
       - Yeah.
              I get to do it
              all by myself now.
This makes just about everything on the base you checked out on now, doesn't it?
                     Just about.
How you coming along with Bromo?
       I'd say, I was
       winning him over, slowly.
At least, he stopped foaming at the mouth every time my name's mentioned.
    That's progress.
    You can't get away from him.
           'Right..'
I'll see you later.
'That was flight 745 taxing.'
         Quite a view.
Sixty four square miles of level rock-hard landing surface.
 We figure you save the country,
 a quarter of a billion dollars
     in safe emergency landings.
   Edwards is one of ten centers
   under General Shelby
         and Aero Search
         and Development Command
         but it's developed into
         a pretty big operation.
         I have over 8000 people
         on duty here.
  There's our rocket engine test
  station right over there
                 in those hills.
     High altitude speed course,
     deceleration track.
             All this is just
             a bird's eye view..
     Oh, there's the Gilbert 120
     taking off right now.
'Yes, Mr. Gilbert was telling me we really got something there.'
Before I came here, I thought you tested mainly airplanes at Edwards.
Just what is your mission?
  Quality. Flying hardware of
  better quality than the enemy.
   Not just the aircraft but
   the power plant, the armament
 the RADAR, everything that goes
 with the vehicle
           to make up a complete
           weapon system.
   How long have you been in
   command here, Bill?
          Well, it's going
          on six years now, sir.
         I'm just really getting
         broken in, Senator.
 What it boils down to, is this.
   Our whole future air strategy
rests on the accuracy of the data, our guys pass on to the planners at Washington.
I'd call that a good sized responsibility.
   We try and pick the good ones
   and throw out the bad.
What was that?
 Sonic boom. An aircraft
 penetrating the sound barrier.
You're looking at an engine right now with enough thrust to reach outer space.
     - What's stopping you?
     - Money.
   Then the guiding system.
   We're still perfecting it.
'Attention! Final warning for ten second countdown.'
  This high speed track is the
  world's fastest
    and straightest railway.
 - 'Ten. Nine.'
 - Sled'll do 1500 miles/hour.
   'That way we can make
   some tests on the ground'
  'without risking the pilot.'
'Five-four-three-two-one.'
'Fire!'
   Senator, there you see
   an Air Force tanker refueling
       a bomber and two fighters
       at the same time.
'Yes.
A B-66, an F-100, an F-101.'
 'Some of our latest aircraft.'
        - Bye, Senator.
        - Thanks a lot.
    - Goodbye, general.
    - It's a pleasure, sir.
           Carry on.
 We just intercepted a radio
 call, Mickey, what's going on?
 Major Bond just called in, sir.
 Having trouble with the 120.
             Says he's got
             aileron on reverse.
'Edwards Control to Major Bond.
What's your present position?'
I'm eight miles south to the lake at 22000 ft., Edwards.
    I'm trying another roll
    to the same side.
'There she goes again,
Edwards Control.'
I think I've got something else.
 I've got wrinkles in the skin.
 My left wing.
This is General Banner, how bad are the wrinkles, Bond?
     - Not too bad, sir.
     - Can you land safely?
   - 'Affirmative, General.'
   - Alright, bring her in.
 - Keep checking on that wing.
 - Roger.
'Control to Major Bond, you're cleared'
   'for an immediate landing
   on runway 22.'
 - What'd you do? Pull ten Gs?
 - No, sir. Less than five.
     - Report to my office.
     - Yes, sir.
 Did you authorize Bond to carry
 out any stability tests?
    No, sir. It was strictly
    a check up.
      - I recommend, sir--
      - Yes, Connie?
   - Major Bond is here, sir.
   - Send him in.
        Come in, Major.
    What's the story, Linc?
    It's the wings, General.
They won't take the design load on a rolling pull out.
       Until, they're
       beefed up stronger
     you've got
     a dangerous airplane.
      Somebody's gonna
      pull the wings off.
    I don't agree, General.
I pulled more than five Gs with no sign of structural weakness.
You must've exceeded design limits.
  It happened exactly at 4.5 Gs.
You must've pulled more Gs than that. Maybe you blacked out?
  No, sir, I didn't black out.
  I'm sure it's gust loads.
Hitting few bumps for a fraction of a second would do it.
    If it could happen to me
    it's gonna happen to others.
  Bromo Lee is plenty capable
  of running phase four tests
 on that aircraft. You were up
 there for familiarization.
 Why did you start
 your own private test program?
 Sir, I stumbled on a condition
 that didn't feel right.
    I wasn't looking for it.
But when it happened
I thought I oughta pin it down.
            Alright.
But Gilbert's chief engineer tells me, you must be mistaken.
      Maybe he can explain
      the wrinkles, sir.
    The question is
    what really caused them?
  You're telling us, Major Bond,
  we're committing ourselves
 to mass production of a fighter
 with a dangerous defect?
                 Yes, sir. I am.
    Mickey, is the other 120
    in commission?
 It'll be ready tomorrow, sir.
 Set it up for me. Linc, I want
 you to fly chase.
And help me duplicate the exact conditions you encountered.
  General, since Bromo's been
  directly responsible
  for this project, it'll save
  time if he flew with Bond
       on the first one.
Save my time? What do you think
I'm here for, Mickey?
        Very well, sir.
 That's all for now, gentlemen.
Bill, you suppose bond pressed the panic button up there?
             I'm gonna find out.
How do you feel about his reliability?
               It's this simple.
If I were commanding an army and he was guarding my left flank
   I'd be running there every 30
   minutes to check up.
Why you wasting your time on him?
  Well, because what I said just
  now is a personal feeling.
      I'm gonna judge him on
      performance, nothing else.
You know, Bill, this X2 may well be as far as we can go with a human pilot.
And expect him to survive.
                    Yes, I know.
How soon are you starting tests with rocket power?
 Not for several months.
 We've lot of blind drops to do.
Decided on our pilot for it.
        I'll take that one, sir.
      That's been my pet project
      from the beginning.
  I've watched six years, nine
  million dollars and the brains
   of 280 engineers go
   into that X2. Excuse me, sir.
  - Banner.
  - 'This is Harvey Gilbert.'
               Yes, Mr. Gilbert.
'What's this about wrinkles in the wing? Is it true?'
              Yes, that's right.
              News travels fast.
'...accepting his report?'
        We don't know yet.
        We'll find out tomorrow.
Of all people, we don't consider a brainwashi qualified
        to say we've got
        a bad airplane.
   I'd like to come up there
   right away.
   Fine, we'd be glad to see ya.
  Alright, Mr. Gilbert, goodbye.
     Well, he's in a real storm.
Well, I can't say I blame him.
I'm equally concerned.
Bill, running Air Research and
Development Command has turned into a tremendous responsibility.
I could sure use you at my headquarters.
   How soon do you think you can
   wind it up here?
Wind it up sir?
Oh, I can't leave this job now right in the middle of all the new projects we're getting into.
Not that I don't appreciate your asking me.
I know there's no job more important than yours.
    I'm glad you agree we're not
    exactly an old man's home
        back there in Baltimore.
    Leave some of the strenuous
    testing to Mickey and Bromo.
                     The others.
Oh, it's good for the circulation, General.
     Just remember, you and I
     aren't getting any younger.
Yes, Connie.
                 I have the 104
                 data here, sir.
Oh, good let's have a look.
That's all.
         - Hey, Connie?
         - Yes, sir.
Do you think I'm getting old?
            Well, I'd say that's
            the usual procedure.
I mean maybe I'm too old to compete with these youngsters around here.
       - You mean flying?
       - All departments.
        In experience, I'd say
        you're older than Moses.
          But you seem ten years
          younger than you are.
It's a good definition of what the commander here better be.
You know, Connie, one thing
I'm not going to do is get my brains knocked out at any high school competition over you. I'd lose that one.
All I'm asking is that I be the first one you tell.
              Of course, I will.
            The first thousandth
            of a second, I know.
    Oh, wait. Mr. Gilbert,
    this is Major Bond, sir.
         - Mr. Gilbert.
         - Oh, yes.
            Lincoln Bond.
            Structural Engineer.
         Just a pilot,
         Mr. Gilbert.
             Very modest of you.
  I was just talking with
  Gilbert's chief test pilot.
    He inspected the damage
    and frankly he thinks
    you're out of your mind.
    However, I'm going ahead
    with the test anyway.
           Yes, sir.
Give me a double. Honest double.
Do you mean that, sir?
   Yeah, I wanna see how four
   ounces of alcohol
  affects a flyer's judgment.
    Connie, I didn't know you
    were working the West Coast.
Linc, you've a real important day ahead of you tomorrow.
   They're all important, honey.
  It's just that some are little
  more depressing than others.
       However,if it bothers you
       to see me to lush it.
              I'll wait it out
              until you've gone.
What's the matter? You're afraid you're wrong?
I have a feeling I've never been right a day in my life.
It should show one way or other shouldn't it?
          It should but then you
          never know.
I know one thing, mister.
Anybody who's thinking about having any kind of tussle at all with Bill Banner had better think it over carefully because he's really in the heavy weight division, Lincoln he belongs there.
   Yours could hardly be an
   impersonal opinion, could it?
I just know the General in question never ran away from a thing in his life.
He faces things head on, Linc.
And when he does, people always wonder what hit them.
There was a time when I thought that you and the General were two of a kind.
 Let's just chalk it off to
 girlish enthusiasm, shall we?
         Just a minute.
    Hi. Am I still under
    the 10 o' clock curfew?
              Yes.
 - Well?
 - Since you made it. Come in.
 I juts want it made perfectly
 clear that even if you hadn't
    waded into me with those
    bitter, stinging remarks
   I still probably wouldn't
   have taken that drink.
  Because I believe basically
  people don't change.
 I'm a man who's never run away
 from anything in his life.
 I don't know whether you know
 it or not, Connie
  but I've always been a man
  who's faced things head on.
 Whenever I have, people always
 wondered what hit them.
  If you've ever had any other
  impression of me
       you've been wrong.
       Unfairly wrong.
I should be boiled in very warm oil.
    - At least.
    - How about some coffee?
  No, sir, because I've got
  a very important day tomorrow.
 And I believe a man should get
 to bed early before such a day.
Well, hurray for you,
Horatio Alger.
      Thanks for the help, lady.
Any red blooded girl interested in experimental aircraft would've done the same.
   Ha ha. Hey, that's very good.
      About the red blooded girl
      interested
       in experimental aircraft.
       Very good indeed.
 You know all the people around
here who think I'm going crazy like Gilbert's chief pilot, he's an awfully good man, Connie.
     Maybe I did read those
     instruments wrong.
  At Red Prison they got me to
  where two and two
       looked like five.
       Maybe I am crazy.
I'm betting my own money that you're right in this thing.
    Sure, what do all those
    old highly trained engineers
                  know about it?
Will you please relax, Linc?
        It'd be too smooth today
        at 20000.
Well, if we don't find the right conditions there, General
Bromo reported some turbulence lower down.
  All set, Bond. Now, give me
  the exact conditions.
      Okay, General, start
      a shallow dive.
      Stay 40 knots below
      critical Mach number
       at 95 percent rpm.
  Pull 4.5 Gs and a steep bank
  to the left.
'Then give it, three quarter air rock.'
             Roger.
    What is this,
    you're giving us, Bond?
  Everything's normal.
  I pulled more than 5 Gs too.
'I'm afraid the air is too svelte at this altitude.'
   'No gust blows that time.'
'I'll try lower over the mountains at the Pass.'
       'Ought to be bumpy
       enough there.'
'Roger.'
'Giving it 4.5 Gs now, Bond.'
  I can't find anything wrong.
I guess we're not getting quite the same conditions, General.
You mean wrinkles in the wings, you're right. Returning to base.
             Roger.
Well, Mr. Gilbert, everything's seemed normal to me.
     That's not conclusive.
The fact remains that one of my pilots did get wrinkles and till we find out why, Mickey
I want the phase four test
 done over from the beginning.
 Assign Joe Craven to work with
 Bromo on the 120 full time.
   - Double check everything.
   - Yes, sir.
  I'm all for caution, General
  but it can't be overdone.
      Specially in view
      of...circumstances.
    I repeat I think
    you're airplane is okay.
  But if there's one chance
  in a million that Major Bond
   stumbled on something.
   Now's the time to find it.
    I'm confident you won't
    find anything.
  Unless the design limits
  are exceeded. Right, Major?
         Who knows, Mr. Gilbert
         what a limit really is?
It's funny.
Trippin over my own feet.
Me and my big feet.
        You don't look too well,
        General.
Oh, I'm alright.
  The flu's going around. You
  oughta see the flight surgeon.
Flight surgeon?
No, I feel fine.
You've been General Banner's friend longer than anyone else.
I suppose it's occurred to you he can't stay here forever?
       Oh, I hadn't given it any
       thought, sir.
     You know how he flies
     all the winds himself.
   Finds it hard to delegate
   responsibility?
Mickey, it's time to think about another commander.
            But his whole life
            is test flying, sir.
Naturally it'll be an important promotion.
               Boot him upstairs
   when every pilot on this base
   would crawl on his belly
              to Chicago for it?
Mickey, what he's got in his head is too valuable.
General, he wouldn't understand.
  Do you want to risk losing him
  to some big company
     like Gilbert Aircraft?
I know he's had some fancy offers.
That's where you come in. I'm talking to the next commander.
   Start getting ready. Take all
   the load off General Banner.
Aren't you placing me in an awkward position, sir?
  Let's say an unusual position.
       One that involves loyalty
       to General Banner.
I don't know what to say, sir.
             You know him better
             than anybody.
Nudge his elbow every chance you get about the challenge.
The bigger challenge waiting for him in Baltimore.
       I'll try, General.
     But you're handing me
     an awful big pair of shoes.
  Okay, sergeant, pop it out.
With this amount of drag, you'll drop from 20000 feet
                    like a rock.
       We figure 4000 feet
       to be the lowest altitude
         you can get rid of this
         deceleration chute
 with a safe margin to pull out.
Suppose the electrical release mal-functions
    have you got
    a manual release for me?
        Yeah we've installed one
        just in case.
Good. You know the old saying,
"If it can go wrong, it will."
  You wouldn't change your mind,
  would you, General?
 You know, I've been kinda
 hurting to do this test myself.
You've got enough to do.
I can't spare you right now.
I was thinking, sir, Linc Bond's got this current as anyone
 on this F-94. They want you
 pretty badly at the conference.
            I think he'd be okay
            to do this test.
You know my policy, Mickey, Bond is limited to chase and pace.
           Well, I knew that was
           your policy, sir.
       But he's been putting out
       harder than..
          I think he's really
          earned the right, sir.
I know he's putting out.
Just leave it that way.
 You see what I mean about Bond?
'He's been bumming rides in the
B-66 in his spare time.'
     'I don't when
     the guy ever sleeps.'
You're pressing, Mickey. So is
Linc. Pressing too hard, maybe.
Trying to prove something.
That alone can make him a risk.
Oh, thanks.
Oh, never mind, Connie.
No more coffee.
I think I'll knock off.
Why don't you take off, Connie?
You're probably late for a date.
                 That's alright.
That reminds me. When's that wing-ding Lillian's giving?
   - Thursday night.
   - I guess we'd better go.
  Help celebrate Joe Craven's
  promotion.
      When you said we, were you
      including me?
Of course. Why?
Somebody else ask you?
  Incredible though it may seem,
  somebody did.
                   Lincoln Bond.
Make a note in your book to remind me to ask you sooner.
That won't be necessary. You did ask me over a week ago.
     I told Linc,
     I was going with you.
      Hmm, that's a mark
      of a good commander.
     Instinctively he does
     the right thing.
      - I did.
      - You certainly did.
   But don't you go assuming
   I would've said no to Linc
      if he'd asked first.
 Oh, before you go. The mayor's
 appointment tomorrow.
    Will you be down
    from your test by nine?
   Better change him to 9:30.
  And operations called about
  your chase pilot.
 Bromo has to go to El Centro.
     Mickey's tied up too.
 They said Bond was available.
    - Alright, make it Bond.
    - I'll tell them.
   - Thursday night, then.
   - 'Affirmative, General.'
   Okay, Bond, I'm deploying
   the chute.
             Roger.
    You fouled up, General.
    You're only half open.
 Getting plenty of drag though.
 - I've got 4300 feet, General.
 - Roger.
     It's about that time.
     There she goes.
 - You've strung up the shoot.
 - 'I know it.'
   Both release
   has mal-functioned, Linc.
 Well, maybe I can land anyway.
 The chute's only half open.
    Negative. Might open
    all the way any second.
'If it does, you'll spin like a top.'
     I'm gonna have to try
     to snag the chute.
 Don't try it, Linc. Pull away.
        That was close.
      Can you hold
      that position, Linc.
   I'll have to hold it
   right through the landing.
I don't want the chute to pull lose and open again.
   Okay. I'm landing straight
   ahead on the lake.
             Roger.
 For Pete's sake don't lose me.
  We'll leave everything as is
  until they photograph it.
                       Yes, sir.
Well, Linc, how much do I owe you?
            A couple of bucks
            ought to care of it.
Two dollars, huh?
A minute ago my neck wasn't worth two cents.
Well, no sweat, huh?
                       No sweat.
           Lucky we didn't
           need the rescue boys.
Yeah. They would've been a little late.
Too far out.
You know, Linc,
I can't figure you out.
In these emergencies..
Well, it just doesn't jibe with that business in Korea.
Of course, you never did tell me your version of it.
I wish you would though.
Maybe if I understood what really happened.
Something beside the inhuman treatment.
What they use?
Drugs, truth serum?
                        No, sir.
Well, it just doesn't figure.
Even with torture, you're not the kind to crack.
What made you do it, Linc?
  Have you ever been in solitary
  confinement, general?
               Tortured mentally
               24 hours a day.
     Physical torture is nothing
     compared to the things
          they've learned
          to do to a man's mind.
That covers it, huh?
            Well, it's something
            entirely new, sir.
                 If a man hasn't
                 been through it
              it's no use trying
              to explain it.
Look, I'm trying to give you a break.
Give me something to go on.
   What does it take, general?
You think I'm hard to convince, huh?
Well, I am.
I always have been when the test date issued a flaw.
Can't you give me a better reason?
            I wish I could, sir.
Well, at least you showed me something today.
Another step, shall we say?
And if I step you into something more important what's your first choice?
                  Rocket flight.
          X-2 project.
Ah, that's a big step.
Too big maybe.
I always had
Mickey and Bromo in mind
  to work with me on the X-2.
However, Bromo's still got his hands full with the Gilbert job.
- I'll talk it over with Mickey.
- Yes, sir.
      ♪ Off we go into the
      wild blue yonder ♪

        Come on, Carmen.
            Come on.
   You don't want me to have
   to right in my log book
     that you're
     uncooperative, do you?
 I'm not going to your quarters
 for a nightcap
       or anything else.
       I just wanted you
       to see how much
      my wonder box
      geraniums had grown.
        Sure...you did.
        Come on, Carmen.
            Come on.
         - Hiya, Jimmy.
         - Hello, Linc.
 How about all this
 fancy dan flying you're doing?
          Trying to make
          Chuck Yeager look bad?
Chuck could fly better than that before he ever saw a plane.
   So much modesty to be in just
   one little old Korean hero.
A couple of real sharp chase pilots you got tonight.
                 Chase is right.
           I don't like him very much.
Mickey.
        The only man now alive
        who's flown an aeroplane
                 with no wings..
           ...faster than sound.
I was in a hurry.
It's just no way to live.
You're always so jumpy and jittery and popping right out of your skin every time you hear his voice.
           Just because I always
           try to be cognizant
                     to my duty.
Don't know what that means, but I do know all he has to do is say hello, and you shoot up 14 feet.
  Debbie, I wish you'd try not
  to exaggerate every time.
        Hello, Sweeney.
          Oh, oh, oh!
Honestly, you did it again.
You embarrass me so much!
    'Why do you always
    do that sort of thing?'
         His heart's going
         to give out long before
      he makes first lieutenant.
Ha ha!
                    Oh, so soon.
Well, Joe and Polly have finally gotten here.
Let's go.
    - Hi, Joe.
    - Good evening, general.
Those look awfully good, colonel. Congratulations.
      - Thank you, Connie.
      - You too, Polly.
    - Congratulations, Joe.
    - Thank you.
   What does his promotion
   really mean to you, Polly?
Well, for the first time in our marriage, food on the table.
        When did we get a table?
      I'll be right back.
Alright.
    Any messages for anybody
    in the powder room?
No. But on your way past the bar
     would you mind telling
     my husband
     that his leave from me
     has just expired?
    I always like to be
    the bearer of bad news.
            Then as we pulled
            into a steep climb--
   You will be sorry to hear
   that you were just shot down.
  Sarah's reeling in her apron
  strings again, is she?
             Oh-oh!
   I was saving that
   to go to camp this summer.
             But..
Here you sit all by yourself and there are literally 50 girls
        who are drooling
        for you to ask them out.
You know that, but nobody ever tells me.
       Nobody tells you.
 I suppose that little red head
 at the PX isn't telling you.
    Every time she sees you
 she goes into
 that exaggerated model's walk.
     She throws her hips
     out so far you wonder
  if they're ever coming back.
Well, I assume, naturally that she has some sort of trouble with her back.
        Aren't you going
        to join us at the table.
Oh, I was afraid a man all by himself would put a crimp in the fun you couples are having.
            You're just a lonely
           wanderer, aren't you?
I don't think so.
          Well, I hope I see you
          at the table.
             Have a drink on me.
No, thanks, Bromo.
I was just leaving.
           Yeah, maybe your wise
           at that, buddy-buddy.
       'Cause I hear you've been
       bucking real hard
   for the job tests on the X-2.
          And I kind of consider
          that belongs to me.
Good luck.
       I don't like you, mister.
     I'll go home and stick
     my head in the oven.
    Oh, I got a better idea.
Let's go outside, and I'll knock it off for you.
        Come on, Bromo.
        I've got--
              No.
Hey, don't hit him again.
He's drunk.
Linc!
                He held my arms.
              He shouldn't
              have held my arms.
How could you hit him?
      You didn't see
      what happened, Bill.
 It was on account of that man
 over there trying to stop him.
      Whatever it was
      you better get home.
           Yes, sir.
Come on, men, give him a hand.
Connie.
Let's get back to the table.
        We can't just..
         Alright, Bill.
         You go ahead.
     I'll only be a minute.
             Linc.
                If only that guy
                 hadn't held me.
I know, Linc.
I know.
        Look, Connie,
        you're with the general.
             You better go back.
It's perfectly alright.
    Please, it's bad enough now.
I want to talk to you.
        Go on back in, will you?
Better go in there, and explain how it happened.
          That's the worse thing
          I could do.
I know he'd understand.
         Better for him to think
        that I go around socking
        helpless people
                   than peg me
                   for a psycho.
You've got to do something.
                 Leave it alone.
- I'm going back to the base.
- I think I better go with you.
           Don't you understand?
      The general gave me
      my chance and I muffed it.
If he gave me another, I still wouldn't have the right to..
Finally it happened.
Blew my top.
That's what they've all been waiting for.
   Nobody's been waiting for it.
    They're pulling for you.
    Everybody.
It's going to be alright.
         You still don't get it.
              I'll spell it out.
   The Reds hammered me
   to my limit and broke it.
    I put a patch over it,
    and hoped it would hold.
  For months now, I've been
  praying that it would hold.
       Trying to hide it.
    Now the patch is pulled off.
                      It's over.
No, Linc, it isn't.
                  It's all over.
                Goodbye, Connie.
       - Hi there, Linc.
       - Hi, Hank.
    - The party over.
    - No, it's still going.
What are you doing here so late?
  We got a glide drop coming up.
         Hope you get in on her.
         Been making any hit way
         with the old man?
Afraid not.
Just thought I'd drop by and see how it was going.
  You, uh, changed the stick?
             Yeah.
  Moved it half an inch forward.
        Go ahead and try it out.
                     Any better?
I'd even give it a little more.
Of course, it's not up to me.
I wish it were.
       Well, you're about the
       same size as the general.
    Like sitting in the nose
    of a guided missile.
       I guess that's what
       it would be like, alright
        when she carries a man
        right up to outer space.
           Only I'll never know.
      You'd like to Hank,
      wouldn't you?
                   Be the first?
Who wouldn't, Linc.
             Yeah.
'And to have this kind of behavior'
   'from two of our officers'
 'well, it...it's just not the
 sort of thing we point to'
 'with pride in the Air Force.'
      I just can't drink.
      I know that, sir.
 But you proved you could stay
away from it, Bromo for three years until last night.
Now since this is your first slip with me
I'm gonna leave it this way.
Some people just can't drink.
If you ever take another, your career in the Air Force is over
I'll see to that.
      I think the general
      can count on me.
              Yes.
       'Sir, can we give
       out a statement'
    'on the chute emergency
    yesterday?'
 No! I don't want the
 drag chute story released yet.
         - 'Yes, sir.'
         - Not yet.
      'How do you want me
      to handle it, sir?'
 - We've had several inquiries.
 - Alright. Then hold them off!
              Yes.
    Sir, major here is Bond.
I mean Major Bond is here, sir.
          Send him in.
I was about to send for you.
Have you talked to any newspaper men?
                        No, sir.
Somebody leaked a premature report on our chute emergency.
I dropped by your quarters last night.
Where were you?
  I returned to the base,
  and then to my quarters later.
You weren't there when I looked for you.
   Excuse me, general, it'll
   save a lot of questions--
Just let me handle the questions.
 The big question is what am I
 supposed to do about that show
 that you put on with Bromo Lee
 in a public place?
If I ground you you'll be dead weight.
       If I take strong--
 May I say something, general?
    I came in here to resign
    from the Air Force.
So you're, you're ready to quit, hmm?
      I never should've started.
You had to start somewhere.
I appreciate your giving me a chance against your instincts.
Let's say in spite of my prejudice.
             Your first judgment
             was right, sir.
Have a seat, Linc.
What I wanted to talk to you about last night..
                     No, thanks.
...I got to thinking that over.
It just didn't add up.
You slugging Bromo Lee.
Unless there was something else.
     That's right, sir.
     It was a mental thing.
     That's why I want out.
  I was about ready to put you
  into the X-2 project.
So you want to admit failure, huh, Linc?
Look, I've gone along with you this far
I'd feel like it was my failure too.
   I'm sorry, sir. I'm just
   afraid I'd mess things up.
Ever read William Faulkner?
         Yes. Most of his stuff.
Well, than maybe you'll remember something he said when he accepted the Nobel Prize.
   It's sort of, sort of goes
  to the heart of the job here
  at the flight test center.
   Something like,
   "Man will not only endure
       he will prevail."
         Some men, yes.
You'll never know where you'll find it, Linc.
 Excuse me, sir.
 It's Col. McKee. An emergency.
Craven's having trouble, sir.
Aileron reverse, she just snap rolled on him.
'Chase pilot to Craven.'
   'Chop your throttle, Joe.'
 'Just turn everything loose.'
  Okay, Joe, you're out of it.
           Level off.
Craven from Gen. Banner.
You okay, Joe?
'No sweat now, general.'
   'but I was real busy there
   for a minute.'
   'I sure got the reversal.'
   General, I've got wrinkles
   in both wings.
        'How bad, Joe?'
      Worse than Bond got.
        Chase to Craven.
        Hold your level.
       I'll have a closer
       look underneath.
 Wrinkles underneath too, Joe.
    I'm afraid you're
    gonna have to leave her.
'Chase pilot from Gen. Banner.'
       'You're sure it's
       that bad, Harry?'
     Affirmative, general.
The wrinkles are flexing bad in the left wing. May come off.
     General, I still think
     maybe I can land.
       Negative, Joe.
       Get out, get out.
        - Bail out now.
        - Okay, general.
 But I'd like Harry to get some
 pictures of those wrinkles
      before I fire myself
      out of here.
 'Use your own judgment, but I
 advise you to bail out now.'
   Hardly take a minute, sir.
          Okay, Harry.
     'I'm ready to eject.'
         'Stay clear.'
'Bail out, Joe.
Joe!'
       'Can you hear me?'
       'Bail out!'
    'Joe, fire the canopy.'
        'Joe, bail out.'
     Joe, fire the canopy.
     'Get out of there.
     Fire the canopy, Joe.'
'Too late, general.'
  'His chute opened too late.'
Just the instant before he hit.
            Are you sure, Harry?
      'Positive, general.
      He was too low.'
    'Never had a chance.
    He...he's had it, sir.'
           Well, I guess there's
           nothing we can do.
        I let him wait too long.
It's not that, sir.
He, he never answered any calls.
He must've been knocked out.
          Mickey, you know Polly
          better than I do.
     - It might help--
     - I can tell her, sir.
 Only Linc really knows Joe and
 Polly better than any of us.
      - Maybe..
      - Do you mind, Linc?
   - No, sir. I'll tell her.
   - Thanks.
  I'll send the flight surgeon
  and the chaplain over later.
   - 'I'll drop in shortly.'
   - Yes, sir.
   Why do they always have
   to have two or three kids?
          Hiya, Linc.
          Come on in.
        Hi, Uncle Linc.
     Daddy hasn't come home yet.
Hi, Uncle Linc.
            Polly..
  Maybe we'd better go inside.
              Joe?
          I heard it.
He was..
Well, it was instantaneous.
Let me get Sarah McKee for you.
                        Not yet.
         Please, just excuse me,
         will you, Linc?
     You know, I've been
     ready for a long time.
  Kids, how about going to
  Aunt Sarah's for ice cream?
Yeah, yeah!
      Okay, let's go.
      Thanks, Uncle Linc.
        How'd she take it, Linc?
General, she's got more guts than anybody you ever saw.
               Think she's ready
               to see me yet?
Yes, sir. I think she'd really appreciate it.
           I want to thank you
           for going over there.
   We've got a big job ahead
   of us with this X-F 120.
   Major modifications
   on that wing and all that.
   It'll be your project
   of course if you want it.
- Sir, I appreciate that very--
- Ah, Linc.
I hope this has knocked out all ideas of your resigning.
      Well, general, it hasn't
      changed the primary reason
                that I felt
                I should resign.
   The fact that Joe went in
   still doesn't change the fact
            that I went
            sky high last night.
Why shouldn't you have gone sky high?
If a man's taken a lot of nasty beatings while somebody's holding his arms he'd have to be an insensitive idiot not to react violently when he felt somebody was holding his arms again.
What would you do if you got out?
You'd make a rotten insurance salesman anyway.
            I wouldn't care
            to argue that point.
     Well, sir, if I'm back
     on the payroll
     what you said about working
     into the X-2 rocket program
           sounded awfully good.
Alright, Linc, you've got it.
                 Thank you, sir.
          Okay, Linc.
          8000 feet.
      Count off for drop.
       Five, four, three
          'two, one.'
            'Drop.'
Hank, I'm still getting a little buffeting in the nose.
   Stability could be better.
'Stalling action, good.'
         Linc to Harry.
      Are you sure my nose
      wheel is straight?
                     How was it?
You ought to know.
       - Wow!
       - Same way I felt.
That was really something, Mickey.
But the real charge would be with rocket power.
      The old man's set on doing
      that himself.
          I think it's
          a younger pilot's job.
 - I know.
 - I got this much out of him.
      I get to do this next drop
      with partial rocket power.
I want you to get qualified to be my launch panel operator.
Well, that's something anyway.
      Passing 20,000 feet.
    Launch panel cameras on.
     Selector switch, off.
      Count for jettison.
       Five, four, three
          'two, one.'
        Locks, jettison,
        switches open.
       Come off the X-2!
       Come off the X-2!
        Get out, Mickey.
        Get out quick.
   Bond to pilot.
   Drop her! Drop her quick!
'Yes. Yes, sir, that's right.'
'Well, what happened?'
'We don't know, general.'
 'They told me she just blew.'
      Something more Barn,
      but we haven't--
'Well, anyway, this settles it.'
     I'm not taking anymore
     chances with you.
     On the test
     with full rocket power
      you've got to assign
      somebody else.
      The day I can't run
      my own show
     I'm turning in my suit
     for a different model.
'Don't be pig headed, and stubborn.'
'I'm sorry, but if you tie my hands--'
'Nothing personal, Bill.'
       'I'm just thinking
       of the Air Force.'
'Yes, general,
I appreciate that.
'But we need you here in Baltimore.'
'Okay. But not until this one's finished. This one's mine.'
'Remember what I told you.'
'We're not getting any younger.'
'Yes, sir. Goodbye.'
  That was a real close call
  for Mickey McKee, wasn't it?
                    Yes, it was.
Mickey said you must've been almost psychic.
As if you'd had premonition.
            I don't go for that.
         The instruments weren't
         reading quite right.
   Anyway, testing is based
   on facts not premonitions.
   Linc, there's still one thing
   after all this time I don't
   understand about test flying.
             What?
Why anyone should want to do it?
Well, why do you think?
   I haven't the slightest idea.
At first, I thought maybe it had to do with something silly like
 proving to each other
 what real good he-men you were.
      But I never met one of you
      that needed to prove that.
     Maybe it's the money.
No, I'm serious.
It's a mystery to all the other women I know.
  Well, part of it is the
  excitement and satisfaction.
             Doing something
             for the first time.
                  The challenge.
       That's a very small part.
            When you love flying
     you know that the aeroplane
     wants to fly right.
You get a compulsion to make it as perfect as you can.
 But with you and Bill and the
 others, it's almost fanatical
        like a religion.
               Ever heard of
               a good ballplayer
       who lived much
       of anything but baseball?
Or a woman that didn't know that the...only really important thing in life was having children?
  But that happens to be true
 because if we didn't have them
 where'd you get
   all your ballplayers or..
          Test pilots?
         That's right.
 Is Bill Banner still planning
      to fly the big test
      in the new X-2?
              Yes.
        Should he do it?
    Have you or Mickey explained
    to him that he shouldn't?
 No, Gracie Allen, we haven't.
    Just the same, if Bill
    shouldn't fly that test
      and everybody knows
      that he shouldn't
 then somebody should tell him.
       Yes, they should.
       Linc, I'm almost..
   I probably shouldn't ask.
  But what's Bill going to be
  up against in the X2?
  Well, you can't say exactly.
   First time a man goes over
   a hundred thousand feet..
     ...three or four times
     the speed of sound
 hits the heat barrier
 where the friction of the air
   makes the wings white-hot.
And the pilot has a fraction of a second to make decisions.
    Why did they have to use
    anything as dangerous
       as rockets anyway?
    There isn't any choice.
         No other type of engine
         develops enough power.
           Those two rockets
           in the tail of the X2
          give it enough power
          to drive a battleship.
Linc, do you have any idea?
Well, any premonition about Bill?
      I don't have premonitions.
             Connie, you've said
             Bill four times?
      If it weren't Bill
      it would be another pilot.
You know it's Bill.
             Yes, I guess it is.
            Well, I got an early
            take off tomorrow.
     - 'Do you have to go?'
     - Yes, ma'am.
Goodnight, Linc.
At least I'm glad it doesn't have to be you.
   You haven't understood a word
   I've been saying, have you?
    I'd give anything if it were
    going to be me up there.
           And I'd give anything
           if it were me
          instead of Bill Banner
          down here.
         I don't know.
   She oughta be ready for
   a try at full rocket power
    but how can you be sure?
    This time she's going
    right out of this world.
Let's face it, Hank, you'll never be sure.
      Maybe one more time
      with one rocket.
     I don't see why, Hank.
   Mickey and I have already
   done three more drops
   than we did on the old X2.
       Everything is
       checking out okay.
      Maybe you're right.
      Well, whatever
      General Banner says.
Yeah. See ya, Hank.
Any chance he'll let one of you fly?
           Not a prayer,
           you know the general.
     Thanks for the coffee.
  Tomorrow's okay with Hank
  if it's okay with you, sir.
         Then it's on.
       Something else
       isn't okay though.
      Ever since you went
      to Baltimore, Mickey
  there's been new heat
  on me to delegate this test
      to a younger pilot.
   Now I get a TWX that's
   a next thing to an order.
     Did you have anything
     to do with this?
  They pinned me down, general
  I gave them a straight answer.
       Younger pilot,
       you for instance?
                             Me.
                        Or Linc.
        We've been friends
        for a long time, Mickey.
           If I can't depend on
           your absolute loyalty
I'd better get me a new director for flight test.
       If it's a question
       of loyalty, sir
  that'll never be necessary.
                           Okay.
        Alright, wheel and deal.
               Set me up for
               an 05:30 takeoff.
           Yes, sir.
May I speak to the general privately?
      What's on your mind, Linc?
Well, sir, I never wanted to ask a favor.
 Pretty hard to turn you down.
   Well, what I mean sir is..
    ...I'd like to make this
    next flight in the X2.
- You too?
- I hope I'd earned the chance.
     I've flown in her
     as much as anyone now.
      I don't know what's
      the matter with you.
   We know this
   is gonna be a rugged one.
       That makes it
       my responsibility.
    I have a responsibility
    too, sir.
       That day in
       the locker room..
    - What about it?
    - You almost passed out.
- That could happen in the air.
- I told you, I tripped.
      We both know
      what happened, sir.
   I think the flight surgeon
   would agree with me.
You'd go to the flight surgeon?
    I didn't say that, sir.
    I know best whether
    or not I'm safe to fly.
      General, may I speak
      off the record?
        Go right ahead.
I know what it's like to go through hell.
I've been there, and I failed.
And I would've failed here too if it hadn't been for you.
You gave me your confidence and your respect.
                  You earned it.
      Not my own respect.
 'You reached your limit once
 but that was all in the past.'
     You would've held out
     until they killed you.
         Keep talking.
I think I've faced myself on that score.
Have you faced yourself?
Have you faced the fact that with your stubborn pride your blind egotism and time catching up with you
     'you could jeopardize
     this whole project?'
        That's enough--
If you keep this up your failure can be greater than mine was.
   You're the only man alive
   that could say that
   to me that I'd listen to.
       Is it true, Linc,
       is it that bad?
    I wish I didn't have
    to be the one to say it.
      Do the rest of them
      think the same?
    I can't speak for them.
      Well, I'm not making
      any promises.
   But I can't fly them all.
       Somebody else will
       get their chance.
       But not this time.
       I still wish you'd
       change your mind.
   I guess that's all, Linc.
      Very well, general.
And I think you can count on the zero wind for the landing.
               Hello, Linc.
               Hank, come on in.
         - Coffee?
         - No, thanks.
             What's the problem?
      Well, sir, it isn't
      exactly a problem.
      Hank was
      wondering whether..
    Well, maybe you better
    tell the general, Hank.
General, I've been going over the figures again and could we have one more drop at half power?
Just one rocket?
I know you're anxious to go ahead--
  I'm not that anxious, Hank.
       Not until
       you're satisfied.
Then I'd suggest, sir that Major Bond repeat exactly the same test he made last week.
   Well, the only thing
   I don't like is the delay.
'I'd really feel better, sir.'
   What's your opinion, Linc?
   Well, sir, everything checked
   out normally on my last test
      but it would give you just
      that much more information
      before using both rockets.
        Certainly couldn't hurt.
          Okay, Hank,
          I'll approve one more.
You take it up, Linc.
You'll be getting a piece of what you want anyhow.
'I appreciate it.'
       After Bond's test
       set me up
      as soon as possible
      for the final test.
  - Both rockets, full power.
  - 'Yes, sir.'
            'Linc.'
     How about flying Chase
     for you tomorrow?
                   Okay, Mickey?
             Okay.
'Weather report's still okay for take off time?'
       'Affirmative.
       Wind's subsiding.'
    - 'Forward tank filled?'
    - 'Check.'
     - 'Aft tank filling?'
     - 'Check.'
'Operations inform Bond we still have a zero wind for takeoff.'
    'Affirmative, he knows.'
   That liquid oxygen
   is really frosting up now.
      Snow's beginning
      to form on the skin.
How do you feel, Linc?
  I always get a few butterflies
  with rocket power.
         Yeah, so do I.
  But using one rocket you can
  stay below 70,000, alright.
                No problem, sir.
       - Good luck.
       - Thank you, sir.
       - Good luck, Linc.
       - Thanks, Bromo.

   There goes number two too.
'He's fired both rockets.'
- He's got full power, general.
- I know, I heard it.
What does he think he's doing?
       Did you give him
       a choice, general?
       Later, Hank.
       Talk to me later.

  Everything's going haywire.
  I can't..
         'I can't. I..'
    Ask Bromo if he's still
    in contact with Bond?
      Bell control to Major Lee.
   Are you still reading the X2?
'Negative.'
     'His transmission
     was getting garbled.'
  'The last I heard, he was
  firing the ejection system.'
                      Thank God.
The flight surgeon is here, sir.
And Colonel McKee.
Send them in, Connie.
            Come in.
How is he now, doc?
  He's gonna make it, general.
Good.
      Near as we can tell
  a wind blast tore open
  that experimental face plate
      at high altitude
      and passed him out.
      And he's got a mild
      brain concussion
      and an injured hip.
Ah, Linc's a pretty rugged customer.
       He had to be.
       It was that close.
 He's still coming out
 of a severe case of the bends.
      Call for excellent
      physical condition.
Oh, I know that.
 Frankly, sir, a pilot your age
 wouldn't have had a chance.
 Well, sir, I better be
 getting back to the hospital.
Thank you, doctor.
Well, Mickey, I've been here a long stretch.
Seems like a lifetime.
      Tests that came out
      okay, and some bad.
'But in a way they were all successful.'
What I meant to say Mickey..
...I've got news for you.
I'm transferring to headquarters
Air Research and
Development Command.
I'll recommend you to succeed me.
     We're gonna miss you, Bill.
I know you'll do a great job.
           - Thanks.
           - Coffee?
No. thanks, Connie.
   About Linc's flight, sir.
 General Shelby's headquarters
 wants to know
  if he violated orders
  going to full rocket power?
Of course, he didn't violate orders.
I left it up to him.
Verbal orders.
   Then we better amend this
   operations order, officially.
         - In writing.
         - Alright.
It's amended.
        - Line of duty.
        - Yes, sir.
  Connie, what are your plans?
   I imagine I'll stay here.
Of course, I'd love to have you go with me.
          I'd love it too, Bill.
         But you know that story
         about the paratrooper
         who was afraid to jump.
    And the general asked him
    why he became a paratrooper?
                    The boy said
    "Because I like to be around
    guys who like to jump."
   I guess I'm that way
   about the flight test center.
Yeah.
I know what you mean.
   I'll miss these guys
   around here, all of them.
        Mickey, Linc.
        Specially, Linc.
 There's a big fire burning
 out of control near the dump.
                Tell them to put
                it out, Sweeney.
           Yes, sir.
   But, sir, won't they just
   naturally go ahead and..
    Yes, sir, I'll tell them
    to put it out.
   Connie, I'll tell you how
   much I think of Lincoln Bond.
                He deserves you.
      Now, you'd better get over
      to the hospital, hmm?
Bill, I'm so sorry.
      Look, you don't have
      to worry about me.
Anybody who's waited as long as I have to get married probably knows subconsciously what a rotten husband he'd be anyway.
             Don't give me that!
              I'm tellin' you
              what the man said.
       I'm not responsible
       for the caliber of orders
     that are given around here.
           Under this antiquated
           military system
             they're given to me
             and I pass 'em on.
      Lieutenant Sweeney.
  I'm leaving for Baltimore
  so you'd better get me packed.
           Yes, sir.
  If you're coming along you'd
  better start packing yourself.
  You mean, you want me to go
  along with you, sir?
    Well, let's put it this way.
  After having been
  in the service almost 25 years
         I've run into something
         completely new
               and unheard of
               in the Air Force.
 I don't want to let it get away
 until I find out what it is.
           Yes, sir.
      Something new
      and unheard of, sir?
        A second lieutenant with
        a general for an aid.
That'll finally hit him tonight in bed and he'll go right through the ceiling.
I don't care if that is against regulations.
     It's all your, Mickey.
  Take good care of the place.
I won't say goodbye, Bill.
I know you'll be droppin' in on us to keep your hand in.
     Connie, you take good
     care of Mickey.
        I'll do my best.
       And I'm not saying
       goodbye, either.
     You'll be coming back.
          Sure, sure.
   You see that Linc follows
   Doc Bailey's orders.
  He's not supposed to be out
  of bed for another week.
           What the..
      - Button your coat.
      - I know, I know.
   It was like getting out
   of Alcatraz but I made it.
                          Linc..
      ...when are you gonna
      learn to carry out orders?
  Sorry, general, but I've never
  been able to miss a parade.
           Present..
          Order, hut.
        There goes a lot of guy.
A lot.
   As much as we'll ever see.
Well, almost.
- Be right out, Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.
- The car's here, sweetheart.
- All right, darling.
Rhoda.
Rhododendron, pal.
That's a mighty pretty piece.
It's Au Clair De La Lune, Daddy.
In English, that means
"By the Light of the Moon."
I hate to tune you off.
Have you got time to say goodbye to your old man?
Of course, Daddy.
Will you write Mother every day?
I'll write both my girls every day.
And will you put in a special page just for me?
She has to have a very special page all her own, you know.
A special page with lots of X's.
Monica, how nice.
Yes, here's your effusive landlady from upstairs, darlings... come to say goodbye.
No life of my own, so I need other people's.
I speak for my brother Emory as well as myself.
He had to go to the train to meet Reginald Tasker.
He's the speaker at our Psychiatry Club this evening.
Emory never gets a chance to speak when I'm around.
I've talked enough.
You say something, Colonel.
It will just have to be goodbye, Monica.
I'm taking off.
Do something about not having a war.
I'm not ready to be turned into a piece of chalk just yet.
By gum, I'll try.
You said "by gum" because I'm here.
You're right. I did.
Don't worry about your two darlings.
If either of them begins to look peaked,
I'll send up smoke signals.
Thanks, Monica.
Rhoda, dear, let's stay here... so Mommy and Daddy can say goodbye by themselves.
Besides, I have a surprise for you.
Presents?
Rhoda!
All right.
I'll take my goodbye present here.
Now.
What will you give me if I give you a basket of kisses?
I'll give you a basket of hugs.
I'll miss your hugs.
I'll miss your kisses, Daddy.
You're so big and strong.
See my effect on girls?
Goodbye now, sweetheart.
- Take care of Mommy?
- I will, Daddy.
- Goodbye, Monica.
- Goodbye.
Come on, darling.
What have you got for me, Aunt Monica?
Let's see if you can guess.
- Good morning, Sergeant.
- Good morning, Mrs. Penmark.
Thanks, Sergeant.
Darling, when you see Daddy in Washington... will you have him come and pay me a visit?
Sure, I will.
Kenneth.
- We've lived through this before.
- I know it.
I'm just not in any mood to shout hooray, that's all.
Smile, girl.
My girl?
Yes, for ever and ever.
Bye, darling.
Look, Mommy!
Monica, what have you given her now?
It's a pair of dark glasses... to keep the sun out of those pretty blue eyes... and the rhinestones to frame them in.
My, who is this glamorous Hollywood actress?
I like them.
- Where's the case?
- Here it is, dear.
Didn't you ever hear about spoiling people?
Nonsense!
Now here's something else.
This was given to me when I was 8 years old.
It's a little young for me now.
But it's still just right for an 8-year-old.
Monica...
I just don't know what I'm going to do with you.
However, there's a garnet set in it... so we'll have to change that for a turquoise... since turquoise is your birthstone.
Could I have both stones?
- The garnet, too?
- Rhoda.
What a way to behave...
Why, certainly you may, of course.
How wonderful to meet such a natural little girl.
She knows what she wants, and she asks for it.
Not like these overcivilized little pets... that have to go through analysis... before they can choose an ice-cream soda.
Dear, sweet Aunt Monica.
Darling, I know I'm behind the times... but I thought children wore blue jeans... or playsuits to picnics.
You, my love, look like a princess in that red-and-white dotted Swiss.
Tell me, aren't you afraid you'll get it dirty... or that you'll fall and scuff those new shoes?
She won't soil the dress, and she won't scuff the shoes.
Rhoda never gets anything dirty... although how she manages it,
I don't know.
I don't like blue jeans. They're not...
You mean blue jeans are not quite ladylike, don't you, my darling?
You sweet, old-fashioned little dear.
Am I to keep this now?
You're to keep it until I can find out where to get the stone changed.
I'll put it in my treasure drawer.
Rhoda, we'll be leaving in a few minutes.
Is your room all straightened?
Yes, Mother.
Unnecessary question.
LeRoy.
LeRoy.
Yes, Miss Breedlove?
What on earth do you think you're doing?
I'm just trying to hurry with my chores, ma'am.
Ring first and wait.
If nobody answers, then use your key.
Morning, Mrs. Penmark.
I left my chamois and pail... doing the inside windows yesterday.
Very well, LeRoy. They're in the bathroom.
Does he always crash in that way?
Only when we're up and about, I think, trying to prove his individualism.
LeRoy doesn't mean any harm.
He has the mind of a child, but he's managed to produce a family... so I keep him on.
Monica.
Good morning, Miss Uppity.
When I was in school, we didn't have no picnics.
I don't care what you didn't have.
We'll go right along, dear.
I just want to write this tuition check for Miss Fern.
Yes, Mother.
Excuse me.
You sound like Fred Astaire tap-tapping across the room.
What have you got on your shoes?
I run over my heels... and Mother had these iron pieces put on them... so they'd last longer.
I'm afraid I can't take any credit.
It was Rhoda's idea entirely.
I think they're very nice. They save money.
You penurious little sweetheart.
You think of everything, take everything so much to heart.
That's one reason why I thought you should have some presents today.
You wanted to win that penmanship medal very much, didn't you?
It's the only gold medal Miss Fern gives, and it was really mine!
Everybody knew I wrote the best hand, and I should have had it.
I just don't see how Claude Daigle got the medal.
Rhoda.
These things happen to us all the time... and when they do, we simply accept them.
Now, I've told you, darling, try to forget it.
I'm sorry. I know you don't like people pawing over you.
It was mine! The medal was mine!
Have you completely lost your senses?
- Look at Rhoda's shoes.
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Breedlove... but she had to come running out...
- just as I was...
- LeRoy!
Sorry, ma'am.
LeRoy, I own this apartment house.
I employ you...
I've given you the benefit of every doubt because you have a family.
I've thought of you as emotionally immature... torn by irrational rages, a bit on the psychopathic side.
But after this demonstration,
I think my diagnosis was entirely too mild.
You're definitely a schizophrenic with paranoid overtones.
I've had quite enough of your discourtesy and surliness... and so have the tenants in my building.
My brother has wanted to discharge you.
- I've taken your side despite misgivings...
- Monica...
- I shall protect you no longer...
- Monica.
He didn't mean it. It was an accident.
- Sure, it was...
- He meant to do it. I know LeRoy.
It was no accident, Christine.
It was deliberate, the spiteful act of a neurotic child.
He meant to do it.
You watched out of the corner of your eyes.
- Rhoda, I want you...
- You made up your mind in one second!
I never. I'm just clumsy!
My patience is at an end, and you might as well know it.
Get about your work!
It's much too lovely a morning for such tirades.
Now, don't forget our luncheon with Reggie Tasker.
Dear me. I haven't put in my order yet.
What do you feed a criminologist?
- Prussic acid, blue vitriol, ground glass.
- Hot weather things.
Nothing would hurt Reggie.
He thrives on buckets of blood and sudden death.
Goodbye, dear.
Have a wonderful, happy day.
Goodbye, Aunt Monica.
That know-it-all Monica Breedlove.
Don't think nobody knows anything but her.
Well, she ain't got long to go anyway.
Old heifer's about ready for the canners.
But that young, trough-fed Mrs. Penmark... she might get kind of Ionesome with that soldier boy of hers gone.
Yes, sir, she might.
Yeah, that Rhoda's a real smart one.
That's a smart little gal.
She's almost as smart as I am.
She sees through me, and I see through her.
Swallow me a frog, but she's smart.
Jenny Fürst, you come back here!
- I want to see...
- You're not to go near the water.
Now remember, everybody.
You are not to go out on that pier... or near the boathouse!
- Why, Mrs. Penmark. How splendid.
- Good morning, Miss Fern.
- Good morning, Miss Fern.
- Good morning, Rhoda.
- That was a perfect curtsy.
- Thank you.
You run along with the others.
I want to speak to Miss Fern for a minute.
- Yes, Mother.
- That is, if you have a minute.
Well, we're rather rushed this morning.
But, of course, Mrs. Penmark... shall we talk while I place the favors on the tables?
Yes, of course.
By the way, Miss Fern...
I have the check here for the last quarter.
Here it is.
Why, thank you.
Now, about Rhoda, naturally...
Tell me frankly, Miss Fern... is she always as perfect in everything as she was in her curtsy?
She does everything extremely well, as you must know better than I.
And as a person, does she fit in well at the school?
Let me think. In what way, Mrs. Penmark?
Rhoda's been...
I don't quite know how to say it... but there's a mature quality about her that's disturbing in a child... and my husband and I thought that a school like yours... where you believe in discipline and the old-fashioned virtues... might perhaps teach her to be more of a child.
Yes, I know what you mean.
Do the other children like her?
Is she popular?
The other children?
Of course, Mrs. Penmark.
I really should get things started.
- Will you excuse me, please?
- Yes, of course, and thank you.
But I did meet him. But I did meet Freud!
Nobody ever believes me when I tell them that I met Sigmund Freud.
They just don't believe that you're old enough, little sister.
Anyway, it wasn't Dr. Freud who analyzed me.
It was Dr. Kettlebaum in London.
Monica's been spread out on couches from New York to Los Angeles.
And what was Kettlebaum's verdict?
He said my whole trouble was associating ideas... with words and names.
My marriage to Fred Breedlove, for example.
He said I married Fred because of the combination of ideas... suggested by his name.
The last syllable, "love"... romantic, eternal... and the first syllable...
That is rather obvious, isn't it?
- The result of the analysis?
- It broke up my marriage.
When I explained it to Mr. Breedlove, he became so confused... between his first syllable and his last syllable... that he just gave up.
Let's sit over there, so we can get away from analysis.
At least be comfortable.
Yes, come on, Reggie.
Entertain us with your latest work.
What is your bloodthirsty scribbling about to disclose now?
I've been making a collection of data on Mrs. Allison.
News Budget wants an article on her.
You mean that practical nurse who killed all those people?
My, yes. That simply fascinating, paranoidal female.
Listen, Christine.
Mrs. Allison was a quite definite personality.
She did away with nine patients... for the life insurance, with almost as many different poisons.
You read about her in the papers, Mrs. Penmark?
Only hastily, I must say.
I'm afraid I shy away from reading about such things.
Now that's an interesting psychic block.
Why would Christine dislike reading about murders?
I don't know. I just have an aversion to violence of any kind.
I even hate the revolver
Kenneth keeps locked in the house.
Do you dislike the revolver more than the poison?
I just hate them both.
Maybe if you try saying the first thing... that comes into your mind, we can get at the root anxiety.
Just say it, no matter how silly it seems to you.
Tell your story, Reggie, and Christine will associate.
- What nonsense.
- What do you mean, "associate"?
Just speak up, because any idea that comes into your mind... will be an associated idea.
They finally caught on to Mrs. Allison... when she poisoned her 80-year-old father... with arsenic in his buttermilk.
- There, say anything quickly.
- But what?
I'll be a middle-aged Mongoloid from Memphis.
Sweetsie, little lovebird.
Now you play your little cards right, and instead of a piece of cuttlebone...
Uncle Emory will get you a piece of Dr. Kettlebaum.
Emory.
Go on, Christine, no matter how silly.
What I was thinking at that very moment... was that outside of Kenneth, my father is the dearest man... in the whole world.
- Is that silly?
- No, certainly not.
- Isn't your father Richard Bravo?
- Yes.
There's a man that can write for you.
Those pieces from the Pacific during the war.
I'm very proud of him.
The whole country is, but we've disclosed nothing yet.
Go on with your story, Reggie.
I think we can afford a change of subject.
All right, then, there.
What does that suggest to you?
It doesn't suggest anything because I'm still thinking about my father.
What about him?
No editing, no skipping.
What I was thinking that time was even sillier.
I've always had the feeling that I was an adopted child... and that the Bravos weren't my real parents.
You poor, innocent darling.
Don't you know that the changeling fantasy... is the commonest of childhood?
Why, I once believed that I was a foundling... with royal blood.
Plantagenet, I think it was.
And Emory, let's see. Emory was...
I was a chipmunk.
You really always have had this suspicion...
- that you were adopted?
- Yes, always.
- But no evidence.
- Only that I dream about it.
What kind of dream?
Monica, really.
Do I have to tell my dreams, too?
It's all so silly,
I haven't even mentioned it to Kenneth.
The gal that really took the prize... was that one you wrote about in that first book of yours.
The one that pulled all those jobs, and they couldn't convict her.
You mean Bessie. Bessie Denker.
Most amazing woman in all the annals of homicide.
She was beautiful, she had brains... she was ruthless, and she never used the same poison twice, either.
Her father, for example, died of rabies... supposedly contracted from a mad dog.
It just happened that all his money went to Bessie.
Did you say Bessie Denker?
Yes.
There. Now we might have struck something.
Murderess, poisons, et cetera, ad infinitum.
Monica, this really is nonsense.
Here, let's clear some of these things away.
You still planning on hanging around for a few days' fishing?
I'd sure like to, but I don't want to bother you any.
Listen, any excuse with me for fishing.
We'll get the weather for tomorrow... and if the channel reflects a good deep blue...
...nothing more important has happened for many years... in the field of foreign affairs.
That's the international news for the moment.
Now let's look at the local weather forecast.
For tomorrow and...
I interrupt this program to...
I have been asked to announce... that one of the children on the annual picnic... of the Fern Country day school... was accidentally drowned in the bay early this noon.
The name of the victim is being withheld until the parents are first notified.
More news of this tragic affair is expected momentarily.
- Monica!
- It was not Rhoda.
Rhoda is too self-reliant a child.
It was some timid, confused youngster afraid of its own shadow.
- It was certainly not Rhoda.
- Emory, please!
To continue with the weather.
What am I standing...
We now have the full story on the Fern School drowning.
We are now authorized to give you the name of the victim.
It was 8-year-old Claude Daigle... the only child of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Daigle of 126 Willow Street.
He appears to have fallen into the water from the abandoned pier... on the Fern property.
It is a mystery how the boy got on the pier... for all the children had been forbidden to play near or on it.
But his body was found off the end of the landing... wedged among the pilings.
The guard who brought up the body... applied artificial respiration, but without result.
There were bruises on the forehead and hands... but it is assumed that these were caused by the body washing against the pilings.
And now to continue with the report of local weather.
Scattered showers...
That poor little boy. That poor child.
They'll send the children home immediately.
They must be on their way now.
I don't know what to say to her.
Rhoda is eight. I remember
I didn't know anything about death... or it didn't touch me closely until I was much older.
A teacher I adored died.
My whole world changed and darkened.
Monica, here comes the bus now.
I don't know what to say to her.
This is between you and Rhoda now.
Nobody else can help.
I suppose.
I would come with you... but I think mother and child are better alone at a time like this.
Darling!
Mother, we didn't really have our lunch... because Claude Daigle was drowned.
I know. It was on the radio.
He was drowned, so then they were all rushing, calling, and hurrying... to see if they could make him alive again, but they couldn't.
They said the picnic was over, and we had to go home.
I'm glad you're home.
So could I have a peanut butter sandwich and milk?
Rhoda, did you see him?
Yes, of course.
Then they put a blanket over him...
No. Did you see him taken from the water?
Yes, they laid him out on the lawn and worked, but it didn't help.
Sweetheart...
I want you to try to get these pictures right out of your mind.
I don't want you to be worried or frightened one little bit.
These things happen to us sometimes... and when they do, we simply accept them.
But I thought it was exciting.
Can I have the peanut butter sandwich?
Why, yes, darling.
I'll get it ready for you.
LeRoy.
Just doing my baskets, Mrs. Penmark.
Good.
- I thought I'd go out and skate after.
- Very well, dear.
Mighty awful event at the Fern School this morning, Mrs. Penmark?
Yes, LeRoy. It was very sad.
They say when they found that little boy...
Yes, Mrs. Penmark.
Now, Rhoda... you're behaving very well, dear... but still, it's a terrible thing to see and remember.
I understand how you feel, darling.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't feel any way at all.
Have you been naughty?
Why, no, Mother.
What will you give me for a basket of kisses?
I'll give you a basket of hugs.
I want to finish my sandwich while I skate, Mother.
Well, then you should.
How come you go skating and enjoying yourself... when your poor little schoolmate's still damp from drowning in the bay?
It looks to me like you'd be staying home, crying your eyes out.
Either that or be in church, burning a candle in a blue cup.
You ask me, and I say you don't even feel sorry... about what happened to that poor little boy.
Why should I feel sorry?
It was Claude Daigle who got drowned, not me.
Ain't scared of nothing?
I'll find a way to scare you.
"The knight had not gone more than a dozen paces...
"before he saw beside the path...
"a beautiful lady who laid out a fair damask cloth under an oak...
"and set thereon...
"cakes and dainties...
"and a flagon...
"with two silver cups..."
- Mommy.
- What?
Why aren't you reading?
I was just thinking, I guess.
About what, the accident?
Partly. And my telephone call.
The circuits were busy.
What are cakes and dainties?
They're like little cakes, you know.
"Cakes and dainties, and a flagon with two silver cups.
"'Knight,' she called. 'Knight, come eat...
"'and drink with me, for you are hungry and thirsty, and I am alone."'
Did you take your vitamins, dear?
Yes. I took one before. This is my second.
I was saving them because I like the juice.
- I'll close my eyes, but I won't be asleep.
- I know.
"And then the knight answered her.
"'I thank you, fair lady, for I am not only hungry and thirsty...
"'but I'm lost within the forest.'
"Then he let his palfrey graze nearby...
"and he feasted with the lady, who gave him loving looks...
"sweeter than the wine from the flagon, though the wine was sweet and strong.
"And in this fashion, the time passed...
"till the light was gone out of the wood and it was dark.
"And he was aware that the pavilion had not been there in the daylight...
"but had been created...
"out of darkness...
"by magic."
Rhoda.
- May I come in, Mrs. Penmark?
- Yes, of course, Miss Fern.
I was going to come and see you.
I got your note.
We're in such distress, all of us at the school.
We've suffered such a blow, losing one of the children that way...
- I know...
- I'm sure you'll forgive us... for going over and over things.
I think everyone has been worried, puzzled, and saddened.
I don't think I've ever known any happening to puzzle... so many people in so many ways... and I can help so few of them.
I've just come from seeing Mrs. Daigle.
Of course, our first thought was of her.
The rest of us are touched only lightly by this tragedy.
- She'll have to live with it all of her life.
- I know.
I've seen her several times... and each time she's asked me to find out from you... if you had any possible clue to where the penmanship medal might be.
It was lost?
Yes, it wasn't found with the body, and has completely disappeared.
I didn't know about this.
- Good morning, Miss Fern.
- Good morning, Rhoda.
Mother, could I sit under the scuppernong arbor for a while... and read my book?
- Of course, Rhoda.
- It's so shady there... and I can see your window, you can watch me from there... and I'd like to be where you can see me.
Is it a new book?
It's Elsie Dinsmore, the one I got for a prize at Sunday school.
- I'll be here.
- I'll be right there all the time.
Goodbye, Miss Fern.
It occurred to me that Rhoda might have told you a detail or two... that she hadn't remembered when she talked with me.
You see, she was the last to see the little Daigle boy alive.
- Are you sure of this?
- Yes.
- I hadn't realized...
- Several times during the morning...
Rhoda had to be stopped from following Claude around... and trying to take the medal away from him.
She kept snatching at it... and he finally became very upset and started to cry.
I'm terribly sorry to hear this.
When you say that Rhoda might have been the last one...
- to see the little Daigle boy alive...
- Yes.
Shortly before Claude's body was discovered... the beach guard saw Rhoda coming off the wharf.
He shouted a warning, but by then she was on the beach... and walking back to join the main activity.
So he decided to forget the matter.
The guard didn't identify the girl by name... but she had blond pigtails and was wearing a red dress, he said.
And Rhoda was the only girl who wore a dress that day.
At 1:00, the lunch bell rang... and Claude was missing when the roll was called.
- You know the rest of it.
- Yes, but this is very serious.
- lf Rhoda was on that wharf...
- Not serious, really.
Children conceal things from adults.
Suppose Rhoda did follow the Daigle child onto the wharf.
So many things could have happened, quite innocently.
He may have concealed himself in the old boathouse... and then when discovered, may have backed away from Rhoda... and fallen in the water.
That could have happened, but I don't...
Later on, when it was too late to do anything... she was afraid to admit what had happened.
Then, you do think that Rhoda knows something she isn't admitting.
Yes, I think that like many a frightened soldier... she deserted under fire.
This is not a serious charge.
Few of us are courageous when tested.
Yes, but she has lied, though.
Is there any adult who hasn't lied?
Smooth the lines from your brow, my dear.
You're so much prettier when smiling.
Well, I'll question Rhoda.
I wish you would, though I doubt you'll learn more than you know.
Miss Fern, there's something
I've been wanting to ask you.
There was a floral tribute at the Daigle boy's funeral... sent by the children of the Fern School.
The children must have helped share the expenses... but I haven't been asked to pay my part.
I know, my dear.
We thought you'd like to send flowers individually.
Why should I want to send flowers individually?
Rhoda wasn't friendly with the boy... and my husband and I haven't even met the Daigles.
I don't know, my dear. I really...
There are three of us.
In the hurry of making decisions...
You make excuses for Rhoda, at the same time, you admit to me... that you didn't ask me to pay my share of the flowers.
And the reasons you give me for not asking are obviously specious.
Does this mean that in the minds of you and your sisters... there's some connection... between the boy's death and Rhoda's presence on the wharf?
I refuse to believe that.
- But you've acted as if there were.
- Yes, perhaps we have.
Perhaps you...
Miss Fern, this has been a terrible tragedy for Mrs. Daigle.
As you say, she's lost her only child... but if there's any shadow over Rhoda because of what has happened... then I have to live under it... and my husband does, too.
As for Rhoda, she would not be happy in your school next year.
No, she would not.
And since she would not... it would be as well to make up our minds now... that she will not be there.
Then there is some shadow over her.
You've already decided not to invite her back.
- Yes, we've made that decision.
- You can't tell me why?
I think her behavior in the matter of the medal is sufficient explanation.
She has no sense of fair play.
She's a poor loser. She doesn't like to...
Surely you're not saying that Rhoda had anything... to do with the Daigle boy's death?
Of course not.
Such a possibility never entered our minds.
I'll have to answer that.
Of course, my dear.
Thanks, we're Mrs. Daigle and Mr. Daigle.
You didn't have to let us in.
You realize we followed you.
We shouldn't have done it.
I'm a little drunk.
I guess you never get a little drunk.
You're very welcome, both of you.
Don't pay no attention to him.
He's all for good breeding.
He was trying to stop me.
How are you, Mrs. Penmark?
You've always had plenty.
You're a superior person...
- No, I'm not.
- Yes.
Father's rich. Rich Richard Bravo.
I know. Famous.
Me, I worked in a beauty parlor.
Miss Fern used to come there.
She looks down on me.
- Please, Mrs. Daigle...
- I was that frumpy blond.
Now I've lost my boy, and I'm a lush.
Everybody knows it.
We're worried about Mrs. Daigle.
She's under a doctor's care.
She's not herself.
But I know what I'm about just the same.
Just the same.
May I call you Christine?
I'm quite aware you come from a higher level of society.
You probably made a debut, all that.
I always considered Christine a gentle name.
Hortense sounds fat.
That's me. Hortense.
"My girl Hortense," they used to sing of me...
"hasn't got much sense.
Let's write her name on the privy fence."
Children can be nasty, don't you think?
Please, Hortense.
You're so attractive, Christine.
You got exquisite taste in clothes.
Of course, you got ample money to buy them with.
What I came to see you about...
I asked Miss Fern what happened to Claude's medal... and she wouldn't tell me a thing...
- I don't know...
- You know more than you're telling.
You're a sly one 'cause of the school.
You don't want the school to get a bad name.
You know more than you're telling,
Miss "Butter Wouldn't Melt" Fern.
There's something funny about the whole thing.
I said so over and over to Mr. Daigle.
He married quite late, you know, in his 40s.
Of course...
I wasn't exactly what the fella calls a spring chicken, either.
We won't have any more children.
No more.
Please, Hortense, let me take you home where you can rest.
Rest? Sleep?
When you can't sleep at night, you can't sleep in the daylight.
I just lie, and I look at the water where he went down.
Christine, there is something funny about this whole thing.
I heard your little girl was the last one to see him alive.
Would you ask her about those last few minutes... and tell me what she says?
Maybe she remembers some little thing.
I don't care how small it is.
No matter how small.
You know something?
Miss Fern dyes her hair.
She knows something, and she won't tell me.
My poor little Claude, what did I do to you?
Christine, somebody took that medal off his shirt.
It couldn't have come off by accident
'cause I pinned it on... and it had a little lock with a clasp in the back. It was no accident.
You can wear such simple things, can't you?
I never could wear simple things.
I couldn't even buy them.
When I got them home, they didn't look simple.
He was such a lovely, dear little boy.
He used to say I was his sweetheart... and he was gonna marry me when he grew up. I used to laugh so.
"You'll forget about me long before then.
"You'll find a prettier girl, and you'll marry her."
You know what he said then?
"No, I won't...
"'cause there's not a prettier girl in the whole world than you are."
If you don't believe me, you ask the lady who comes in and cleans.
She was present at the time.
Why do you put your arms around me?
You don't give a hoot about me.
You're a superior person and all that.
I'm just...
God forgive me.
There were bruises on his hands... and that peculiar crescent-shaped mark on his forehead... that the undertaker covered up.
He must have bled before he died.
That's what the doctor said.
And where's the medal?
Who took the medal?
I have a right to know what happened to the penmanship medal!
If I knew, I'd have a pretty good idea what happened to him.
I know why you put your arms around me.
I'm as good as you are.
Claude was better than your girl.
He won the medal. She didn't.
I'm drunk.
It's a pleasure to stay drunk when your little boy's been killed.
Maybe I better lay down.
We'll go home. You can lie down there.
Why not?
Why not go home and lay down?
- Goodbye, all.
- Sorry.
Who cares what they think?
I drank half a bottle of bonded corn in little sips, so I'm drunk as I can be.
Poor woman.
I'll be getting back.
Thank you for bearing with her and with me.
I'll talk to Rhoda.
I know there isn't anything that will help that poor creature... but I'll do what I can.
We both have to do what we can.
- Goodbye, Mrs. Penmark.
- Goodbye, Miss Fern.
She'll have to live with this until she dies.
Yes, until she dies.
Thank you.
- Rhoda.
- Yes, Mother?
Will you come in a moment, please?
May I just finish this last page?
Very well, but then I want to talk to you.
Yes, Mother.
Hello?
Yes, speaking.
Kenneth?
Darling, I am so glad you called.
Honey, what was the accident at Rhoda's school?
The one where the little boy was drowned?
The little boy who was drowned?
Has it affected Rhoda any?
No, Rhoda's her usual self.
She's right outside where I can see her.
I just talked to her.
I miss you both and love you both so much.
Do you really, darling?
I hope it won't be too much longer.
It'll be at least four weeks.
Four weeks is a long time.
Write to me as...
Kenneth.
Yes, darling?
I love you.
Col. Penmark, the General is waiting, sir.
I'll be right there.
Honey, the General just buzzed for me.
All right, dear, then don't keep him waiting.
Goodbye, darling. Give my love to Rhoda.
Bye.
Monica!
Don't be alarmed. I'm just in and out.
This is not another psychiatric session.
Come on in, please.
It's Rhoda's locket I'm using for an excuse.
I've actually found a place where they'll change the stone and clean it.
I'll get the locket.
I know where she keeps it.
- I think it's in her treasure box.
- Good.
They didn't agree to this without a little pressure.
- In fact, I had to threaten them.
- Not really!
You don't know the old busybody.
She uses pressure, influence, bribery, blackmail.
And I had to pull them all on old Mr. Finchley.
He said this little job would take at least two weeks.
But I told him straight...
I'm handling the community chest again this year.
You found it. The darling.
She keeps her treasures so carefully.
It's a kind of miserly delight.
- Shall I wrap it?
- No, darling.
I'll just drop it in my purse.
My horoscope says today is the day for paying attention to small objects... and getting things done.
Now I take to the air, dear Christine.
Only do forgive me for bursting in and rushing out.
No ceremony, please.
No, darling. Be seeing you.
What did you want to see me about, Mother?
So you had the medal after all.
- Claude Daigle's medal.
- Where did you find it?
How did the penmanship medal... happen to be hidden under the lining in the drawer of your treasure chest?
Now I want the truth.
Mother, when we move into our new house... can we have a scuppernong arbor?
Can we? It's so shady and pretty.
- And I love sitting under...
- Answer my question!
And remember, I know more about the picnic than you may think.
Miss Fern has told me a great deal.
Don't make up any stories for my benefit.
What was Claude Daigle's medal doing in your drawer?
It certainly didn't get there by itself.
I'm waiting for your answer.
I don't know how the medal got there, Mother.
How could I?
You know very well how the medal got there.
Did you go on the wharf at any time during the picnic?
Yes, Mother. I went there once.
Was it before or after you were bothering Claude?
I wasn't bothering Claude, Mother!
- What makes you think that?
- Why did you go on the wharf?
It was real early, when we first got there.
Why did you go on the wharf?
You knew it was forbidden.
One of the big boys said there were little oysters that grew in the pilings.
I just wanted to see if they did.
A guard said he saw you coming off the wharf... just a little before lunchtime.
I don't know why he says that.
He's wrong, and I told Miss Fern he was wrong.
He hollered at me to come off the wharf, and I did.
I went back to the lawn, and that's where I saw Claude... but I wasn't bothering him.
What did you say to Claude?
I said if I didn't win the medal...
I was glad he did.
Rhoda, please!
I know you're an adroit liar... but I must have the truth.
But it's all true, every word!
I was told that you were seen trying... to snatch the medal off Claude's shirt.
Is that all true, every word?
Oh, that was one of the monitors... that big girl, Mary Beth Musgrove.
She told everybody she saw me.
Even LeRoy knows she saw me.
You see, Claude and I were just playing a game we made up.
He said if I could catch him in 10 minutes... and touch the medal with my hand, it would be like Prisoner's Base.
He'd let me wear the medal for an hour.
How can Mary Beth say I took the medal?
- I didn't.
- She didn't say you took the medal.
She said you tried to grab at it, and that Claude ran away down the beach.
- Did you have the medal even then?
- No, Mother, not then.
- Rhoda, how did you get the medal?
- I got it later on.
How?
Claude went back on his promise.
Then I followed him up the beach.
Then he stopped and said
I could wear the medal all day... if I gave him 50 cents.
Stop that!
- Is that the truth?
- Why, yes, Mother.
I gave him 50 cents, and he let me wear the medal.
Then why didn't you tell this to Miss Fern when she questioned you?
Mommy, Miss Fern doesn't like me at all.
I was afraid she'd think bad things of me if I told her I had the medal.
Rhoda. Now, listen to me.
You knew how much Mrs. Daigle wanted that medal, now, didn't you?
Yes, Mother, I guess I did.
Then why didn't you give it to her?
She's lost her little boy, Rhoda.
She's heartbroken about this.
She may never get over it.
It may have destroyed her.
Do you know what I mean?
Yes, Mother, I guess so.
No, you don't know what I mean.
But it was silly to want to bury the medal pinned on Claude's coat.
Claude was dead.
He wouldn't know whether he had the medal pinned on him or not.
I've got the prettiest mother.
I've got the nicest mother.
That's what I tell everybody.
I say I've got the sweetest mother in the world.
If she wants a little boy that bad... why doesn't she take one out of the orphans' home?
Rhoda! Get away from me.
Don't talk to me.
- We have nothing to say to each other.
- Okay, Mother.
Rhoda, when we lived in Wichita, there was an old lady... who lived upstairs, Mrs. Clara Post.
She liked you very much.
Every afternoon you used to go upstairs to visit her.
She used to show you all her treasures.
The one that you admired most was a crystal ball in which a little fish floated.
Old Mrs. Post promised this to you when she died.
Then one afternoon when her daughter was out shopping... you were alone with the old lady, she fell down the spiral backstairs... and broke her neck.
You said she heard a kitten meow... and went to see what it was and accidentally missed her footing... and fell five flights to the courtyard below.
- Yes, it's true.
- Later, you asked her daughter... for the crystal ball, and she gave it to you.
- It's still sitting on your treasure chest.
- Yes, Mother.
Rhoda, did you have anything...
I don't care how small it was.
Did you have anything to do with the way Claude got drowned?
- What makes you ask that?
- Come here.
Now look me in the eye and tell me the truth...
- because I must know!
- No, Mother, I didn't!
You're not going back to the Fern School next year.
- They don't want you anymore.
- Okay.
I'm going to go and call Miss Fern and have her come over here.
No! She'll think I lied to her!
- You did lie to her!
- But not to you, Mother! Not to you!
Hello, Fern School?
Miss Claudia Fern, please.
No, no message.
She isn't home yet.
Mother, what are you going to do with the medal?
It's really mine.
Rhoda, come here to me.
It can't be true.
$0.50, $0.75, $5, and $5 are $10.
Thank you very much, Colonel.
- And here's the card to go in it.
- Yes, Colonel.
None of it will get broken in the mailing?
No, it will be specially packed in excelsior for that.
Good. Thank you.
Look, a tea set!
I guess we know a daddy who loves somebody, all right.
What does the card say?
"For no reason, except she's the sweetest little girl in the world.
"Daddy."
Look, it's got a pot and everything.
Mother, could I take it out under the arbor for a while?
I want to pretend
I'm giving a garden party.
Yes, dear. And, by the way... unpack it while you're out there, will you?
Because this excelsior is just getting over everything.
Don't put it down the incinerator because it's much too large.
Leave it out by the cellar doors for LeRoy to dispose of.
Yes, Mother.
A garden party. Isn't she the perfect little, old-fashioned girl?
By the way, Miss Emily Post, do you know you're having supper with me tonight?
Really, Aunt Monica?
Is it a special reason?
No. Just that I've invited
Reginald Tasker for cocktails.
You remember, Rhoda,
Granddaddy's coming tonight.
I'm going to have dinner with him.
And that's much too late for you to eat.
- Wasn't that nice of Aunt Monica?
- Of course. Aunt Monica's sweet.
And I'll be glad to see Granddaddy.
He's sweet, too.
I wish she were mine.
Every time I look at her,
I wish I had just such a little girl.
There she is at her little table, playing with her little dishes...
Iooking cute and innocent...
Iooking like she wouldn't melt butter, she's that cool.
She can fool some people with that innocent look... she can put on and put off whenever she wants, but not me.
Not even partway, she can't fool me.
Don't wanna talk to nobody smart?
Like to talk to people she can fool... like her mama and Mrs. Breedlove and Mr. Emory.
Here's some excelsior for you.
You talk silly all the time.
I know what you do with the excelsior.
You made a bed of excelsior... down the basement, behind that old furnace... and you sleep there, where nobody can see you.
I've been way behind the times heretofore... but now I got your number, miss.
I've been hearing things about you that ain't nice.
I heard you beat up that poor little boy in the woods... and it took all three of the Fern sisters to pull you off him.
I heard you run him off the wharf, he was that scared.
If you tell lies like that, you won't go to heaven when you die.
I heard plenty.
I listen when people talk, not like you... gabbing all the time, won't let nobody get a word in edgewise.
That's why I know what people are saying and you don't.
People tell lies all the time, but I think you tell them more than anybody else.
I know what you done to that little boy when you got him on that wharf.
You better listen to me if you want to stay out of bad trouble.
What did I do, if you know so much?
You picked up a stick, and you hit him with it.
You hit him with it because he wouldn't give you that medal, like you told him to.
I thought I seen some mean little gals in my time... but you're the meanest.
You want to know how I know how mean you are?
'Cause I'm mean.
I'm smart, and I'm mean.
And you're smart, and you're mean.
And you never get caught, and I never get caught.
I know what you think.
I know everything you think.
Nobody believes anything you say.
You want to know what you done after you hit him?
You jerked the medal off his shirt, and then you rolled that sweet little boy...
- off that wharf among them pilings.
- You don't know anything.
None of what you said is true.
I'm telling the gospel truth, you know I got it figured out.
You figured out something that never happened, and so it's all lies.
Now take your excelsior down to the basement... and sleep on it when you're supposed to be working.
You ain't no dope, that I must say.
That's why you didn't leave that stick around where nobody could find it.
No.
You got better sense than that.
You took that bloody stick... washed it off real good, and you threw it in the woods...
- where nobody could find it.
- You know, I think you're a very silly man.
It was you who was silly, thinking you could wash off blood, and you can't!
Why can't you wash off blood?
Because you can't, and the police know it.
You can wash and you can wash, and there's always some left.
Everybody knows that.
I'm going to call the police and tell them... to start looking for that stick in the woods.
They got what they call
"stick bloodhounds" to help them look... and them stick bloodhounds can find... any stick there is that's got blood on it.
When they bring in that stick you washed off so good... the police are gonna sprinkle some special blood powder they got on it.
That little boy's blood is gonna show up on that stick.
Gonna show up a pretty blue color, like a robin's egg.
You're scared about the police yourself.
What you say about me is all about you.
They'll get you with that powder.
Rhoda, it's time to come in now.
- Time to get ready for supper.
- Yes, Mother.
Getting up this excelsior, Mrs. Penmark.
Messing up my lawn here.
- What were you saying to Rhoda?
- Why, nothing, Mrs. Penmark.
We was just talking about her little play dishes.
You're not to talk to her again.
If you do, I'll report you.
Is that entirely clear?
But, ma'am...
I started it, Mother.
It wasn't LeRoy's fault.
Very well, but you're not to talk to her again.
- Do you understand?
- Yes, ma'am.
Mother?
Is it true that when blood has been washed off anything... a policeman can still find if it's there?
If he sprinkles some powder on the place... will the place really turn blue?
Who's been talking to you about such things? LeRoy?
No, Mommy, it wasn't he.
I heard some men talking about it when I was out front this morning.
I don't know how they'd test for blood, but I could ask Reginald Tasker.
- Or Miss Fern, she would know.
- No, don't ask her!
Mommy, nobody helps me.
Nobody believes me.
- I'm your little girl.
- All right, Rhoda. It is not a very good act.
You may perfect it enough to convince someone who doesn't know you... but right at present, it is quite easy to see through.
Maybe I'd better go up to Monica's and have dinner.
Yes, she said any time.
Good evening, Mr. Tasker.
You can't renege on the invitation now.
I showed up.
I'm very glad you could come.
- This is my daughter, Rhoda.
- Hello, Rhoda.
- Isn't she a little sweetheart?
- Thank you.
That's the kind of thing that makes an old bachelor wish he were married.
- You like little girls to curtsy?
- The best thing left out of the Middle Ages.
I'm having dinner upstairs.
The loss is ours, all ours.
- You may go now, Rhoda.
- Yes, Mommy.
It's been a pleasure to have met you, Mr. Tasker.
Now, there's a little ray of sunshine, that one.
I've seen her stormy.
No doubt.
But she's going to make some man very happy, just that smile.
Since I spoke to you,
I've had a wire from my father.
He's coming here tonight.
It's a whole year since I've seen him.
Richard Bravo's coming here?
Now, there's a man
I've always wanted to meet.
He may be here before long.
He said possibly for dinner.
Good. By the way, dear lady... if you want advice on writing anything, you don't need me.
Not with Richard Bravo on the scene... especially if it's a mystery story, as you said.
Your father was a real authority on crime and horror in his early career.
I know.
He covered every famous case there was.
I'm afraid he wouldn't listen to me.
You're always an office boy to your city editor, aren't you?
- What will it be?
- Gin and tonic?
Good, I'll have that, too.
The question that I wanted to ask you is a psychological one.
I doubt that it's been asked or answered, if it has, until recently.
I may not know all the answers.
Perhaps no one does... but this story that I'm thinking of writing made me wonder.
Tell me, do children ever commit murders... or is crime something that's learned gradually... and grows as the criminal grows... so that only adults do really dreadful things?
Yes, children often commit murders.
And quite clever ones, too.
Some murderers, particularly the distinguished ones... who are going to make great names for themselves...
- start amazingly early.
- In childhood?
Yes, like mathematicians and musicians.
Poets develop later.
Pascal was a master mathematician at 12.
Mozart showed his melodic genius at six.
And some of our great criminals were topflight operators... before they got out of short pants and pinafores.
Yes, but they grew up in the slums, among criminals... and learned from their environment.
Surely, you...
I wonder if that couldn't be Father.
- Daddy!
- Hi, darling.
You're here, you're actually here!
Told you I'd come.
You said you wanted to see me, and I wanted to see you.
I'm so glad.
Father, this is Reginald Tasker.
Reginald Tasker?
- The writer fella?
- Afraid I stand convicted.
- One of my favorites.
- Put you to sleep regularly?
Mostly keeps me awake.
Also, I'm not forgetting... that impressive research you've done for the Classic Crime Club.
Not half as good as the papers they used to publish by Richard Bravo.
That old dodo?
No, he's written himself out and talked himself out.
Now he just hobbles around the country, working for a second-rate news service.
I took time out because I wanted to see my long-Iost daughter.
Where's my granddaughter?
She's upstairs having dinner, Daddy.
- She'll be down in a few minutes.
- That's fine.
Sit down.
Say, any reason I can't have one of those wicked-Iooking mixtures...
Mr. Tasker's consuming?
Daddy, I'm sorry.
You're about ready for another one, too, aren't you?
Haven't you ever considered coming back into the criminology racket?
There's been nobody like you since you left.
All compliments aside... my last books didn't sell as well as my earlier ones... and the war came along, and now I write filler.
You've written some things that will never be forgotten.
Let's hope.
And now your daughter tells me she's gonna try her hand.
At writing? She can't even spell.
It gets Ionely here with Kenneth away.
I thought I might... try a murder-mystery during the evenings.
Are you encouraging this energetic competition?
I must admit, I didn't quite know how to answer her first question.
She was asking me... whether criminal children are always a product of environment.
There's nothing difficult about that, little one. They are.
I always thought so, too.
Always.
I couldn't prove you're wrong, of course, sir... but some fellow criminologists, including some behavior scientists... have begun to make me believe... we've all been putting too much emphasis on environment... and too little on heredity.
They cite a type of criminal... born with no capacity for remorse or guilt... no feeling of right or wrong... born with a kind of brain that may have been normal in humans... fifty thousand years ago.
Nonsense.
If you encounter a human without compassion or pity or morals... he grew up where these things weren't encouraged.
Or at birth, he received some pitiable... physical injuries to the brain tissues.
Certainly not inherited.
That's final and absolute for me.
The rest is hogwash.
And with that outburst,
I terminate for a refill.
No more ice.
Daddy, I'm sorry. It's in the kitchen.
Would you mind?
Certainly not.
Do you really mean to say that nice family surroundings... and advantages could make no difference at all?
Yes. It's as if these children were born blind permanently... and you just couldn't expect to teach them to see.
Would you notice any brutish expressions on their faces?
Sometimes, but more often, they present a more convincing picture... of virtue than normal folk.
But that's horrible.
It's just that they are bad seeds... plain bad from the beginning, and nothing can change them.
This favorite murderess of yours... the one you were telling us about the other afternoon, is she an instance?
Bessie Denker? Was Bessie a bad seed?
Well, yes, I should say so... because when the full story of her career came out... it was realized that she must have started at the age of 10.
- Then she started young?
- Yes.
Isn't that so, Mr. Bravo?
- What so?
- We were talking about Bessie Denker.
I know you covered all her trials... because I read your famous essay listing her methods.
I've forgotten all about those gloomy cases.
Put them out of my mind.
I'm full up with my present prosaic series on offshore oil.
How did she end?
Sweetheart, you don't want to probe into these nonsensical graveyards.
Yes, I do.
Say, Kenneth and I saw the Senators play the Yankees on Sunday.
- And that Mickey Mantle...
- Daddy, please.
Mr. Tasker, would you tell me the rest of the story?
- Did she ever use violence?
- She ended in mystery.
Just when the authorities thought they had her dead to rights... she disappeared, just vanished.
She had quite a fortune by then.
There was a rumor that she went to Australia.
A similar beauty turned up in Melbourne.
Her name was Beulah Demerest.
So if it was the same person, she didn't have to change her initials... on her linen and silver.
How could she kill so many and leave no trace?
Every time she was indicted, she just took off for parts unknown... leaving absolutely no...
Wait a minute!
Wasn't there a child, a little girl?
Never heard of one.
Must be a recent addition to the myth.
There's one more question I'd like to ask.
Wasn't she ever found out here?
Not in this country.
Three juries looked at that lovely dewy face... and heard that melting, cultured voice and said:
- "She couldn't have done it."
- She wasn't convicted?
"Not guilty" three times.
Do you think that she was one of these... poor, deformed children, born without pity?
Did she...
Did she did she have an enchanting smile?
Dazzling, from all accounts.
- She was doomed?
- Absolutely.
Doomed to commit murder after murder... until somehow or other, she was found out.
She'd have been better off if she'd died young.
You've been talking tommyrot, Tasker, and you know it.
On this not-too-merry but disputed point, I'll take my leave.
It's been a great pleasure, sir.
I've been lecturing, so I'm afraid I was the only one to enjoy it.
Not at all.
Don't go to any major-league doctor with that heredity theory.
They'll shoot it full of holes.
We'll stay off the subject the next time we meet.
I'll study up on my baseball.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- And again, thank you, Mrs. Penmark.
Good night.
It's nice to be alone again with my girl.
Are you really planning to write something?
I was just asking questions.
- You saw Kenneth in Washington?
- Yes, he's looking well.
As well as possible when a fella's hot, sticky, and tired... and most of all, Ionesome.
We had planned to go somewhere this summer, but then this... sudden change of orders came through...
Am I looking too close... or is there something heavy on your mind?
Does something show in my face?
Everything shows in your face.
It always did.
I don't know if...
I'm worried about anything now that you are here.
I always felt so... safe and comfortable when you were in the room... and you have that same effect now.
To tell you the truth, you did a magic for me.
I'd always wanted a little girl... and you were everything lovely a little girl could possibly be for her dad.
But, Christine, tell me... what did you want to ask me?
Let me think a minute.
Would you like another drink?
Yes, I guess I would.
- Can I fix you something?
- No, thank you. I don't want any.
Well, speak up, darling.
It's between us, whatever it is.
My landlady here... is a kind of amateur psychiatrist, a devotee of Freud's... constantly analyzing.
- I know the type.
- You'll meet her. Her name is Breedlove.
She's offered a room for you to stay in while you're here.
Rhoda's upstairs, having dinner with her right now.
You were going to come out with something.
Yes, what I was going to ask reminded me of her.
I confessed to her the other day that I'd always been... worried about being an adopted child, and that...
I was afraid that Mommy wasn't really my mother... and that the Daddy... that I love so much... wasn't really mine.
- What did she say?
- She said that it was... the commonest of childhood fantasies, that everybody had it... that she'd had it herself.
It certainly is common.
Yes, but that doesn't help me, because, you see...
I still feel that old fear... that you're not really mine.
Has something made you think about this lately?
- Yes.
- What is it?
My little girl Rhoda.
- What about her?
- Daddy, I'm terrified.
I'm afraid for her.
I'm afraid of what she might have inherited from me.
What could she possibly have inherited?
Nothing but sweetness and...
Father... whose child am I?
- Mine.
- No, Daddy, please don't lie to me now.
It's gone beyond the time where that will help.
I've told you about a dream I have, but I'm not sure it's only a dream.
Whose child am I?
Are you my father?
I know this is a strange question to greet you with... after having been so long away from you... but for Rhoda's sake and my sake,
I must know.
- What has Rhoda done?
- I don't know, but I'm afraid.
Christine, even if it were true... just remember, all this inheritance stuff is pure rubbish.
All thumbs and webbed feet.
I'm sorry.
I won't ask any more questions.
Right, darling.
Let's just close the book.
Besides...
I know the answer now.
- Answer?
- Yes.
Christine, I've been a very fortunate man.
If it hadn't been for you becoming part of my life... all these years would have been empty and Ionely... and unbearable.
The greatest piece of luck I ever had was a little girl named Christine.
You were the only child I ever had.
As I said, you were magic for me.
I was happy and proud to keep going, just for you.
You don't have to say any more.
- I don't, do I?
- No.
You found me somewhere.
Yes.
In a very strange place.
- In a strange way.
- Daddy, I know the place.
I don't think you could have.
You were less than 2 years old.
Then, if I don't know it,
I guess I must have dreamed it.
What kind of dream?
Daddy...
I dream of a bedroom in a farmhouse... in a countryside where there are orchards.
I share the room with my brother, who's older than I am.
One night, somebody... Is it my mother?
She comes to take care of him and...
She's a lovely lady.
She's beautiful, like an angel.
Later, I guess my brother must have died because I'm alone in the room.
One night, I'm terrified to be in that room another minute.
Somehow, I get out of bed, it's moonlight.
I get out the window, drop to the ground below... and I hide myself in the deep weeds beyond the first orchard.
I don't remember very much else, except that towards morning, I'm thirsty.
I begin to eat the yellow pippins that fall from the trees.
When the first light comes up on the clouds...
I can hear my mother's voice... calling to me from the distance, and I don't answer her because I'm afraid.
Now, is that a dream?
Is that only a dream?
What name did she call?
Well, it isn't Christine. Could it be Ingold?
- You remember that name?
- Yes, Daddy.
It's coming back to me now. Ingold.
"Ingold Denker!" she's calling...
Denker!
Daddy.
You've kept this from me all these years?
I came out of that terrible household?
That's where you found me?
The neighbors found you after your mother disappeared.
I discovered you with them before anybody.
The most astonishingly sweet and beautiful little thing... with the most enchanting smile I've ever seen.
As Tasker said, I was there covering the case for a Chicago newspaper.
I wired my wife, and she joined me.
- We couldn't resist you.
- Daddy!
God, help me!
Why didn't you just leave me there?
Why didn't I die in the orchard... and end the agony there?
It was the neighbors who found you and saved you.
Would you rather have stayed with them?
No!
You've been a wonderful father.
It's that awful place and that evil woman!
My mother!
There are places and events in every man's life he'd rather not remember.
Don't let it hurt you now. It's past.
I wish I had died then. I wish it.
It hasn't mattered where you came from.
You've been sound and sweet and loving.
You've given me more than I ever gave or could ever repay.
If you'd been my very own,
I couldn't have hoped for more.
You've known nothing but love and kindness from us... and you've given nothing but love, kindness, and sweetness all of your life.
Kenneth loves you, and you've made him infinitely happy... and Rhoda's a sweet, perfectly sound little girl.
Is she, Father? Is she?
- What has she done?
- It's as if she'd been born blind!
It doesn't happen. It cannot happen.
Excuse me, please, but Rhoda has tired of her puzzle... finished her dinner, and now she wants a book.
We haven't even started yet.
And I haven't met Mr. Bravo.
How do you do?
I'm Mrs. Breedlove, the oversized analyst.
I'm going to put you up, and I promise not to annoy you.
You know what newspapermen are like: crusty, bitter, irascible.
- lf you can put up with me, you're a saint.
- Granddaddy!
- Rhoda.
- Isn't she perfection?
Next to Daddy, you lift me up best.
Why do you look at me?
I just want to see your face.
Mr. Bravo, these Penmarks are the most enchanting neighbors I've ever had.
Now I'll want Rhoda for dinner every night.
Thank you, Aunt Monica.
Tell me, Mr. Bravo, didn't you write the Fingerprint series?
I'm afraid I was guilty of that about 20 years ago.
I read the first volume to pieces, and wept over it... till the parts I loved most were illegible, then bought another.
- Well, I finally met my public.
- I don't disappoint you?
Anyway, I'm large.
I like people who read books to pieces.
It's good for royalties.
It's time I began to get our dinner.
I better find my room and get ready for the evening.
I'll take you up, if you care to go now.
- lf you'll be so kind.
- It's the next floor above.
Good night, Christine.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
Is that for the incinerator?
- Yes.
- But what is it?
It's just some things you told me to throw away.
No!
- Let me see what's in the package.
- No! Give me that!
- Let me see what's in the...
- Give it!
- Let me see what's in the package.
- Give me that!
You hit him with the shoes, didn't you?
You hit him with the shoes. That's how he got those half-moon marks... on his forehead and on his hands!
Answer me, Rhoda.
Answer me!
I hit him with the shoes.
I had to hit him with the shoes!
- What else could I do?
- Do you realize that you murdered him?
But it was his fault!
If he gave me the medal like I told him to,
I wouldn't have hit him!
All right.
All right, now.
We'll start at the beginning, and you'll tell me the truth.
I know you killed him, so there's no sense lying.
Rhoda, I want you to tell me the truth!
- I can't tell you, Mother.
- I want you to...
I'm waiting for your answer.
He wouldn't give me the medal like I told him to, that's all.
So then he ran away from me and hid on the wharf.
But I found him there... and I told him I'd hit him with my shoe if he didn't give me the medal!
But he shook his head and said no.
So I hit him the first time.
Then he took off the medal and gave it to me.
And then what happened?
He tried to run away from me.
So I hit him with my shoe again!
But he kept on crying and making a noise... and I was afraid somebody would hear him... so I kept on hitting him, Mother!
I hit him harder that time... and he fell in the water.
My God.
What are we going to do?
I've got the prettiest mother.
- I've got the nicest mother.
- How did...
How did the marks get on the backs of his hands?
He tried to pull himself back on the wharf... after he fell in the water.
I wouldn't have hit him anymore.
Only he kept saying he was going to tell on me.
Mommy, please say you won't let them hurt me!
I won't let them hurt you.
I don't know what must be done now... but I promise you nobody will hurt you.
I want to play the way we used to, Mommy.
Will you play with me?
- lf I give you a basket of kisses...
- Rhoda, please.
- Please.
- Can't you give me an answer, Mother?
- lf I give you a basket of kisses...
- Rhoda, I want you to...
I want you to go in your bedroom now and read... because I have to think about what to do.
Promise me you won't tell anyone what you've told me. Do you understand?
Why would I tell and get killed?
Rhoda!
What happened to old Mrs. Post in Wichita?
There was ice on the steps... and I slipped and fell against her... and that was all.
That was all?
No.
I slipped on purpose.
Rhoda, get the shoes.
Get the shoes and put them in the incinerator. Hurry!
Put them in the incinerator and burn them!
- What will you do with the medal, Mother?
- I'll think of something to do.
You won't give it to Miss Fern?
No.
I won't give it to Miss Fern.
So your grandpappy finally left?
My mother and I just came from taking him to the plane.
That's really none of your business.
Maybe he don't like you so much.
Maybe he sees through you, like I do.
You know so much.
His editor called from long distance, and he had to go to work... and you better do yours.
I found out about one lie that you told.
There is no such thing as a stick bloodhound.
I ain't supposed to talk to little Miss Goody-Goody.
Then don't.
Where's your mama?
She had to go back to the grocery store.
That's none of your business, either.
And I'm busy with my puzzle.
Puzzle?
You don't puzzle me none,
Little Miss Sweet-Iooking.
For your own sake, I'll tell you something.
There may be no stick bloodhound, but there's a stick, all right.
You better find that stick before they do,
'cause they're going to turn blue.
Then they're gonna fry you in the electric chair.
There isn't any stick any more than there's a stick bloodhound.
You know the noise the electric chair makes?
It goes...
When that juice hits you, it parts your hair neat.
Like lightning struck you.
Go on with your lawnmower.
They don't put little girls in the electric chair.
They don't?
They got a little blue chair for little boys... and a little pink chair for little girls.
I just remembered something.
Just the morning of the picnic,
I wiped off your shoes with the cleats.
You used to go tapping on the walk.
How come you don't wear them anymore?
You're silly.
I never had a pair of shoes like that.
You used to go tapping on the walk.
I'd squirt water on them and you'd wiped them off.
They hurt my feet, and I gave them away.
You know something?
You didn't hit that little boy with no stick.
You hit him with them shoes.
- Ain't I right this time?
- You're silly.
You think I'm silly
'cause I said about the stick.
I was trying to make you say,
"It wasn't the stick, it was my shoes."
- I knew what it was.
- You lie all the time.
How come I got those shoes, then?
Where did you get them?
Just walked right into the apartment, right into your room and took them.
It's just more lies,
'cause I burned those shoes.
I put them down the incinerator and burned them.
Nobody's got them.
I don't say that ain't smart, 'cause it is.
Only suppose I say I heard something come rattling down the incinerator... and I says to myself, "Sounds to me like a pair of shoes with cleats."
I don't say you didn't burn them a little... but you didn't burn them all up like you wanted to.
- Yes.
- You listen, then figure out... which of us is the silly one.
I'm working down the cellar, and I hear them shoes come down that incinerator.
I open the door quick, and there they is... sitting on top of the coals, only smoking the least little bit.
I pull them out.
They're scorched.
Sure, they're scorched... but there's plenty left to turn blue... and show where that little boy's blood was.
Plenty left to put you in the electric chair.
- Give me those shoes back!
- Oh, no.
I got them shoes hid where nobody but me can find them.
You better give me those shoes.
They're mine. Give them back to me.
I ain't giving them shoes back to nobody.
You'd better give them back to me, LeRoy!
I'm keeping them shoes.
Who says I got anybody's shoes except my own?
You did! You get them, and give them back!
I'm fooling you, I'm teasing you.
I got nobody's shoes.
- I got work to do.
- Give me back my shoes!
Don't you know when anybody's teasing you?
Will you bring them back?
Play with your puzzle.
I got no shoes, I tell you.
You bring them back!
I believe you did it.
I was fooling before, but now I believe you killed him.
You killed that little boy with your shoes.
You've got them hid... but you'd better get them and bring them back here... right here to me!
- What is LeRoy saying to you?
- Nothing.
I heard you yelling,
"Bring them back here."
He said he had my shoes.
I got nobody's shoes, Miss Penmark.
You may go, LeRoy.
Yes, ma'am.
There you are.
May I come down a minute?
I have that present I promised a certain precious somebody.
- Yes, of course, Monica.
- I'll be right down.
Rhoda...
I thought I told you not to discuss this with anybody.
- Yes, but he said he had my...
- We'll talk about it later. Get upstairs.
Rhoda! Look what I have for you.
- What is it? The locket.
- My smart little darling, exactly.
- And here's the garnet, too, in there.
- How pretty.
- Will you help me fasten it, Aunt Monica?
- Yes, I will, darling. Come over here.
Now you're going to look just like a little princess.
It's the ice-cream man.
Mommy, can I have a Popsicle?
- What?
- Can I have a Popsicle?
Yes, take the money from my purse.
Rhoda!
What have you got those for?
I just wanted some to play jackstraws with.
Put them down this minute.
You know we have a rule about that.
Yes, Mother.
Why, it's so hot today!
Christine.
Christine, you won't mind if I'm nosy and ridiculous... but you haven't been yourself lately.
It's as if something is dragging you down.
Does it show to other people?
- Then there is something wrong.
- No, Monica. Not really.
I'm just tired, I guess.
Do you take vitamins regularly?
No, I don't.
You should, darling.
That's one of the things we do know.
I have an awfully good combination.
I'll bring some down if I may.
And now you must really forgive me... but have you and Kenneth come to a parting of the ways?
His being transferred to Washington didn't mean that?
- No.
- It can happen in marriage, you know.
That restlessness in cycles of seven or eight years, they say.
Something to do with hormones.
I can't speak from experience... because I always doubted if Mr. Breedlove had any.
No, Monica. It isn't anything like that.
I wish I were as sure of other things as I am of Kenneth.
Do you sleep enough?
No, not always.
You must have some sleeping pills.
That much we can do.
I really don't like sleeping pills.
I'm afraid of them.
I'm not going to bully you anymore, dear Christine.
I'm only going to say that I love you.
Truly I do, darling.
Please, tell me what it is.
- I can't, Monica.
- Please, you can trust me.
- I can't tell anyone.
- Dear Christine.
You'll feel better now.
Perhaps you can get some rest.
Perhaps...
There now, dear.
I'll get rid of whoever it is.
Wait a minute.
Well, Mrs. Breedlove.
Hi.
I know you don't want me here.
I don't, either.
But I can't stay away, so I got a little drunk and came over.
- Excuse me, please.
- You're very welcome.
Like a skunk, I know.
Mrs. Breedlove knows everyone, knows even me.
How are you, Mrs. Daigle?
Well, I'm half-seas over.
I want to have a talk with your little girl.
She was one of the last to see my Claude alive.
I know.
Where do you keep the perfect little lady who was the last to see Claude?
I thought I'd hold her in my arms... and we'd have a little talk, maybe she'd remember some little thing.
Any little thing.
She's out playing, I think.
I'm unfortunate, that's all.
Drunk and unfortunate, ladies and gentlemen.
She isn't there now. I don't see her.
She's a perfect little lady.
That's what I heard.
Never gives any trouble.
Christine, have you got anything in the house to drink?
Any little thing at all.
I'm not the fussy type.
I prefer bourbon and water, but any little thing will do.
Ain't we swank?
Really Plaza and Astor.
I want to have a little talk with Rhoda
'cause she knows something.
I called that Miss Fern on the telephone a dozen times.
She just keeps giving me the brush-off.
She knows something, all right.
Are you all right there?
I'm not intoxicated in the slightest degree.
Kindly don't talk down to me.
I've been through enough without that.
- I brought back change, Mother.
- Very well.
Mrs. Daigle would like to see you.
So this is your little girl.
Claude spoke of you so often... and in such high terms.
You were one of his dearest friends, I'm sure.
He said you were so bright in school.
- So you're Rhoda.
- Yes.
Rhoda, you just come right over here and see me.
Come give your Aunt Hortense a big kiss.
You're the one who was with Claude when he had his accident... aren't you, darling?
You thought you were gonna win that penmanship medal... and worked so hard, but didn't win it, did you?
Claude won it, didn't he?
Now you tell me this.
Would you say he won it fair and square... or he cheated?
These things are so important to me now that he's dead.
Would you say he won it fair, darling?
'Cause if he did win it fair, then why did you go after him for it?
I want my Popsicle.
Let's go shopping now.
Mr. Finchley will show us his collection.
- Right now?
- Yes. We're late as it is.
Take your Popsicle, dear.
You can wash upstairs.
- Well, I must say...
- They really did have an appointment.
I'm sure they did.
Practically sure.
I didn't know Rhoda had all these social obligations.
Thought she was like any little girl that stayed home and minded her mother... and didn't go traipsing all over town with important appointments.
I'm sorry that I interfered with Rhoda's social life.
I offer you my deepest apologies, Christine.
I'll apologize to Rhoda, too, when I can have an interview with her.
You haven't interfered at all.
I was not going to contaminate Rhoda... in the slightest degree, I assure you.
Hello?
Yes, Mr. Daigle, I know. She's here.
No, not at all.
Did you tell him I was drunk and making a spectacle of myself?
Did you tell him to call out the patrol wagon?
No, you heard what I said.
I said only that you were here.
Your husband is at the drugstore at the corner.
I was only gonna hold her in my arms and ask her a few simple questions.
- Perhaps another time would be better.
- You think because I'm lit?
I'm not lit.
Rhoda knows more than she's told... if you don't mind me being presumptuous!
I had a talk with that guard since I saw you last.
That was an interesting conversation.
He said he saw Rhoda on the pier... just before Claude was found among the pilings.
She knows something, all right.
I know what you're thinking.
You're thinking,
"How can I get rid of this pest?"
You may fool some with that mealy mouth.
You look like Ned in the primer to me.
Well, then... perhaps you'd better not come here anymore.
I wouldn't come here again for a million dollars laid on the line.
I wouldn't have come here this time if I'd known about Rhoda's social obligations.
I am going home.
I'm not going to wait for Mr. Daigle.
I know where I'm not wanted, and I'm not wanted anyplace... where people have all these social obligations, if you get what I mean.
Say, you're looking kind of sick and sloppy.
Why don't you come up to my house... and I'll give you a free beauty treatment?
If you're hard-pressed for ready cash, it won't cost you a nickel.
Thank you, Mrs. Penmark.
Come, Hortense. It's time to go home.
My God, it's time to go home.
Christine, you know something!
You know something you won't tell me.
Operator.
I want to call...
Washington D. C... please.
Kenneth, my darling, my love.
What am I going to say to you?
That our baby is...
Never mind it, operator.
Cancel the call.
Good. She's gone.
I know I shouldn't take things into my all-too-capable hands... but I couldn't let her paw Rhoda any longer.
Mr. Daigle came for her.
And I fear I've loosened the discipline just a little.
I let Rhoda go out for another Popsicle.
She wanted a second? That's unusual.
She seemed quite eager, and since she's not one of these... fat, self-indulgent little blobs,
I doubt that it will do any harm.
By the way, darling, here are the sleeping pills and the vitamins... both plainly marked.
Thank you, Monica.
I'll keep them separate.
Emory and Reggie just got back from fishing.
Reggie's having dinner with us before he leaves tonight.
Wouldn't you like to eat with us, you and Rhoda, too?
No, Monica.
Thank you very much.
Really, I'd rather not.
You poor girl.
I do bully you, and I promised not to.
What was that?
It sounded like somebody shouting for help. It sounded close by.
Rhoda, who was that shouting?
I don't know, Mother.
- It sounded as if there were a fire.
- No, I don't think so.
- No, Reg! Back here!
- Look!
Give me that shovel.
Get the hose!
Help me!
It's too late.
- Somebody call an ambulance!
- He's lying still.
Whatever can be done will be done.
Yes, Monica. But now, you see...
I should have known that this was going to happen.
I should have known it.
How could I be so blind?
Thank God Rhoda was in the den playing the piano.
The fire was where LeRoy was!
- There was nothing you could do.
- This time I saw it with my own eyes.
Make them stop screaming because it isn't going to help.
Make her stop that music, Monica.
Because that man is still screaming... and the piano is going on and on while he's dying in the fire screaming.
A man screaming!
- Monica!
- I don't want to see anybody now.
It's Emory, dear.
There was a flare-up in the basement.
Tasker and the rest are putting it out now.
I'm afraid poor LeRoy...
- Never mind.
- I saw him.
I saw him run down the path and die.
Can it be any worse than that?
Seems he fell asleep on a bed he'd made out of excelsior.
I suppose a cigarette set fire to the stuff.
My God, Monica.
Monica, I just simply cannot bear it!
Now she is driving me mad!
How could she play that now?
Rhoda, I want you to...
- What is it?
- Monica, I can't stand it!
How can she play that music now?
Rhoda, stop playing that music!
Stop that music!
Let me get my hands on her!
You didn't see it, did you?
You could turn away, and you could play the piano.
What has she done?
It isn't what she's done.
- It's what I've done.
- What does she mean, Monica?
I don't know, Rhoda.
She'd better go upstairs with me.
- She'll stay till you're calmer.
- Yes, Monica. Would you take her, please?
- But will you be all right, dear?
- I'll be all right!
It just that that screaming got louder!
We'll come down for you later.
Come, Rhoda.
She killed him... but she's my little girl... and I love her.
My baby.
"Polly put one toe out from under the covers to find out how cold it was...
"and it was nipping cold.
"She remembered why she'd wanted to wake up and got out of bed...
"very softly...
"shivering and pulling on her dress and her stockings.
"She'd never seen a Christmas tree decorated and lighted...
"the way they are at Christmas and houses where children have...
"fathers, and it isn't hard times.
"She'd promised herself that she would see one."
You have some new vitamins to take tonight.
- New ones?
- Yes.
- Are those the vitamins?
- Yes.
May I see them, please?
Why, yes, of course.
They're some that Monica sent down.
You know, I think Monica likes me.
I'm sure she does.
Swallowing pills is just a trick.
You're very good at it.
Do you love me, Mommy?
Yes.
Do you know about LeRoy?
Yes.
You told me to put my shoes in the incinerator, didn't you?
Yes.
What did you do with the medal?
I can have it now, can't I?
I drove out to the playground alone... and I went out on the pier when it was dark and no one could see me... and I dropped the medal by the pilings in the water there.
Mommy, LeRoy had my shoes.
He said he was going to give them to the police... and then tell them about me... and they would put me in the electric chair.
You don't have to say any more.
Will you read more now?
Yes, but first you have to take these.
- So many?
- They're a new kind. I'm to take them, too.
I like apricot juice.
It doesn't even need ice.
Mommy...
I saved a couple of matches... and I lit... the excelsior and locked the door.
But it wasn't my fault, Mommy.
It was LeRoy's fault.
He shouldn't have said he'd tell the police about me...
- and give them my shoes.
- I know.
There. That's all.
Don't let them hurt me, Mommy.
I won't let them hurt you.
- Good night.
- Good night, Mommy.
Now will you read?
Yes.
"When Polly was all dressed...
"she found her shawl and crept quietly out of the front door.
"The door creaked and she waited and listened, but nobody woke up.
"She closed the door carefully...
"and looked at the bright moon and the shining cold snow.
"The Carters must have a tree.
They lived two blocks away.
"If they left the curtains open, you could look in and see.
"If only there weren't any dogs.
"Polly walked carefully on the hard snow on the walk...
"keeping the warm shawl close around her.
"It was further than she remembered to the Carters' house...
"but she could see that there were lights in the windows.
"She came near it, only making a little...
"creaking noise on the snow...
"and stood for a while in front of the house...
"before she dared go near.
"Then, she gathered all her courage...
"and walked across the yard, her shoes sinking through the crust.
"The Christmas tree was right in the front window...
"and the lights were on in the house...
"so she could see the fruits and the bells...
"and the strings of popcorn and candy...
"and the silver star...
"at the top."
Rhoda, you're mine... and I carried you... and I can't let them hurt you.
I can't let them take you away and shut you up.
They'd stare at you and make a show of you... and nobody can save you from that unless I save you.
So sleep well... and dream well, my only child, and the one I love.
I shall sleep, too.
Yes, Doctor.
Has she...
- Has anything changed?
- Her condition is still the same.
Can't l...
Please, Colonel, everything possible is being done for Mrs. Penmark.
But it's been two days.
You mustn't go in there.
The doctor will be out soon.
Why did she do it?
Again?
That's what I can't understand.
Why did she do such a thing?
She wasn't unhappy when I left.
Maybe a little bit down about us being separated for a while... because we were in love.
Don't you see? She proved that to me.
Christine and I were in love.
Suddenly, she doesn't want to live anymore.
She seemed a bit upset over the accident to the Daigle boy.
Yes, but she met that perfectly well.
No, a thing like that wouldn't unbalance her to the point of...
Dick, you must have had a good heart-to-heart get-together... when you were down for your visit.
Did she say anything? Mention anything?
You've got to be frank with me.
Ken, there's nothing I can say that will help at all.
Monica, you know she was quite hysterical at the death of LeRoy.
And it was that same night it happened?
Yes. We heard the shot and ran down.
She had done it after giving Rhoda that lethal dose of sleeping pills.
Why, I don't know... but she'd obviously planned that they should go together.
If she doesn't live...
I don't think I can.
Kenneth, my dear, you mustn't talk like that.
Even if the worst does happen... you still have something to be grateful for.
You still have Rhoda.
If we hadn't heard the shot and gotten the doctor quickly...
Rhoda would be gone.
There she is.
Is Mommy better yet, Daddy?
We're waiting, darling.
Come here, sweetheart.
The same lovely smile.
She'll always live in you.
I love you, Daddy.
Sorry, Colonel, there's nothing really definite to report.
She's still in coma.
I have been successful with this type of operation... but it can go either way.
The brain, I feel, definitely is not damaged.
It's mainly shock and loss of...
But we've been all over that.
I really think the best thing you can do is to go home.
A certain young lady here looks rather tired.
She's had quite an ordeal herself, you know.
I really think it would be best.
I won't leave Mrs. Penmark... until we know.
Very well.
Let's go home now, Rhoda.
I forgot my lighter. Be right back.
- Give me a few seconds, Doctor?
- Certainly.
- Smoke?
- Thanks.
I meant to ask you, during my daughter's...
While she's been unconscious, did she say anything?
Mutter anything at all?
Yes, come to think of it, she did.
For a while there, she kept muttering something about...
Yes. "A bad seed."
Does that give you any clue?
Not particularly.
Yes, she was starting to write a book, something around the theory... let me see, that a child can inherit criminal tendencies in the blood.
If you'll forgive me, that's a pretty specious theory.
That's what I told her.
It's a matter of environment, isn't it?
Of course. Now and then, we get a twisted brain chemistry... born to healthy, enlightened parents, but that's one in a million.
- I was sure of that.
- Great Scott, if we were foolish enough... to swallow that other venal belief... nobody would ever either adopt a child or even have children of their own... like that sweet little girl she has, for example.
Thanks.
- Thank you very much, Doctor. Good night.
- Good night.
There, now.
Daddy, will Mommy get well?
- We just prayed for her, didn't we?
- Yes.
What made me sick the night Mommy hurt herself?
Everybody gets tummy trouble now and then.
All ready to turn out the lights now?
What would you give me for a basket of kisses?
A basket of kisses?
I'll give you a basket of hugs.
- Good night, my sweetheart.
- Good night, Daddy.
Daddy. Aunt Monica likes me.
Everybody loves you.
She said if she ever died or anything, or went away... she'd give me Sweetsie, her lovebird.
That's nice, honey... but Aunt Monica isn't going to die or go away for a long time.
- A long time?
- That's right. Go to sleep now.
Daddy, how long do lovebirds live?
- I don't know.
- As long as people?
No, not that long.
I'll find out for sure tomorrow when Aunt Monica takes me... for my sunbath.
Where is that?
Aunt Monica promised me she'd take me for a sunbath.
She fixed up a place on the roof.
Way up high where no one can see us.
- Isn't that nice?
- That's wonderful.
- Good night, sweetheart.
- Good night, Daddy.
Yes?
Col. Penmark?
- Yes, Doctor.
- I have somebody here... who wishes to talk with you.
We can't handle her unless she does.
But don't talk but very little, Colonel.
On your honor, now.
Kenneth.
Kenneth, darling.
They said I'm going to be all right.
Christine, dearest, just to hear you, but don't talk anymore.
Kenneth...
I've committed... a dreadful sin.
And I know that I'm going to have... to pay for it in some way.
Just to know... that I have your forgiveness...
Sweetheart, please don't talk anymore.
Whatever it is, not now.
We'll solve it together.
Oh, Kenneth.
I love you.
I love you.
One moment, please.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, our wonderful cast.
Mr. Gage Clarke as Tasker...
Mr. Jesse White as Emory...
Miss Joan Croyden as Miss Fern...
Mr. Bill Hopper as Kenneth Penmark...
Mr. Paul Fix as Richard Bravo...
Mr. Henry Jones as LeRoy...
Miss Evelyn Varden as Monica...
Miss Eileen Heckart as Mrs. Daigle...
Miss Patty McCormack as Rhoda... and Miss Nancy Kelly as Christine Penmark.
And as for you...
No!

My name is Group Captain Todd.
During the I was commanded an RAF station on the east coast of England.
This is a story of some of the men of an air-sea rescue unit...
... who served under my command.
They didn't fly, but went to sea on high-speed launches.
Their job, to rescue their comrades from the sea.
Their motto:
The time is the autumn of 1944.
The allied armies are sweeping through France...
...and thrusting towards Belgium and Holland.
# If I only had wings... #
Go on, kids, get some sea servicing.
# I'd fly up high #
# Up in the sky #
Shut it in and prime the port engine, can't you, Dray?
Okay, corp.
# If I only had wings... #
Go on, rupt yourself, do!
Stand up!
- Well, what's your name?
- Milliken, sir.
Who are you, what are you?
Armorer, electrician, sanitary welder?
Medical orderly, sir.
Told to report to 2561.
Medical orderly?
Well, what was you in civvy street, a chartered accountant?
- No, sir.
- Don't call me sir.
Save your sirs for the skipper.
He's an officer and knows nothing...
...and therefore entitled to be called sir.
See these?
These indicate the most important rank in the Royal Air Force.
Oy, now then.
What am I?
- A Flight Sergeant.
- And don't you forget it!
No, Flight.
Flight, he says.
Just like that.
What the war does for the Air Force.
When I joined the service it was,
"Yes, Flight Sergeant.", "No, Flight Sergeant."
Three bags full, Flight Sergeant.
Stand still!
My name's Slingsby.
Flight Sergeant Slingsby.
I drink blood and eat grenades.
- Morning, lads.
- Morning, sir. All right, son, fall out.
- Move on, sir? On to sea?
- Tell the engine to start up.
Aye, aye, sir.
Start up, below.
Okay, Dray, start them up.
- Let go springs.
- Springs out, sir.
- Let go out!
- All gone out, sir.
Let go fore head?
All done fore head, sir.
Fire the engine, Clarkson.
- First trip?
- Yes, corporal.
- It's nice and smoothe, isn't it?
- Yeah.
Just another pleasure cruise.
Come on, big time, there's no time for sleeping.
You're in the way.
Over in the bunk, go on!
Robbie, I'm going to change.
Okay, Chiefy.
Have some corned-beef sandwich?
Best in the world, this is.
Here, doc.
- Put that on.
- Thanks, corporal.
There's an overcoat in there if you want it. It's gonna be cold.
Oh, you.
You married?
- No.
- Lucky you.
What's happened? We stopped.
Hey, Gus, do you reckon we'll be back on time?
- Why, are you in a hurry?
- Yes, I am.
Well, we won't then.
You'd better get your head down, Doc.
We've got a long way ahead of us.
Why, where are we?
We're on what's called rendez-vous.
We're going to stay here until somebody tells us to go home.
It's exciting, ain't it?
- You all right, Skip?
- I'm all right, give me a hand.
- Through the hatch, sir, up above.
- Right.
How are the others?
The dinghy's been ejected.
Make your way along to the wing, sir.
Will you finish buckling the belt?
Get in the dinghy.
The craft's going down any minute.
Come on, Skip, let's help him.
Any more for the skylark?
We got a long way to go.
You all right, Skip?
Yes, I'm all right. I got a bit of a whack in the bread basket...
- ...when we ditched, that's all.
- What happened exactly?
We got poked in the engine by a Messershmidt.
But if it's any consolation,
I returned the compliment.
Right now Jerry's on the North Sea, too, sitting on his own little rubber mat.
Boy, is he going to be lonely.
Do you think anyone saw us ditch, Canada?
I shouldn't think so.
I didn't see any ships or anything.
- Where are we exactly?
- Just off the coast of Holland, sir.
About 20 miles from the show.
And a long way from home.
Guess we'd better get organized.
- Canada, can you get that small box going?
- Right.
- Mac, can you set up the aerial?
- Yep.
- Would you mind helping, sir?
- Oh, of course, I'm in your hands.
All I want is to get this briefcase back safely to England.
You just treat me as one of the crew.
She's going.
Well, that's that.
Makes you think, doesn't it?
If any of us had anything sharp on us, rip, zip, and we'd be sitting on about
500 fathoms of ocean and nothing else.
Yes, sir, this little piece of rubber is all there is between us...
... and the bottom of the deep blue sea.
Come in.
- Yes, Flight?
- The weather's getting worse, sir.
- I've posted two bridge lookouts.
- Right.
By the way, how's the new boy?
His name's Milliken, sir.
Herbert Milliken.
- He's a bit seasick, but he'll do.
- You'll get him up to standard, anyway.
- Coffee?
- Thank you very much, sir.
Thank you.
- Is it true about the rumor, sir?
- Yes, this is my last trip.
I'm checking out of the unit at Gosport.
It's a promotion anyway.
I expect the wife's pleased.
How is she?
I took her to the hospital an hour before we left.
The baby's due any moment now.
Oh, by the way, my wife made this.
She asked me to give it with you.
It's a grey coat.
It'll fit a boy or a girl.
It's a nice cozy one.
Thank your wife for me, will you?
- I most certainly will.
- How's your boy?
- Well, he's let me down, sir.
- Why?
He joined the Navy yesterday.
Not again, Milliken!
I don't seem to be able to stop.
I knew a fellow once in the early days of air-sea rescue, he were a medical orderly, too.
He died from seasickness.
He strained his stomach.
Oh, it was a horrible sight.
Hi, Doc, still alive?
- How are you feeling?
- Sick.
There's hot soup in the forecastle.
Come on, I'll get you some.
Self-heated soup! I never touch it.
I don't trust them chemicals.
Come on, chap, get up on deck, you're on.
All right, corp.
Fill your bowls with this.
When's the return to base coming through, Robb?
I'm sick of this bit of sea.
The other bits are just the same.
I never want to see another boat after the war as long as I live.
Ten men and a medical orderly crammed aboard this tub.
What's the matter, Skinner?
Danger of losing a date?
Yeah, a WAF. She promised to see me last night at the station dance tonight.
I thought you were supposed to be overhauling the oil feed...
...on the port engine last night.
- Oh, I did that in 10 minutes.
- I thought it was a big job.
Duke said it would take all night.
The engines got us here and they'll get us back.
Come and take this message, will you, Knox?
There you are, Skinner, the one thing you can do well.
Return to base.
- Hey, Chiefy, Chiefy!
- What's up, Marshall?
There's a kite in the drink northeast of here.
Knox is just decoding them and they're not quite sure of it.
- Get up!
- Return to base, Flight?
Kite the drink.
Start up!
- Kite in the drink, sir.
- Come on boys, there's a kite in the drink.
This is it, Milliken, we're going to war.
- Ahead all speed, Flight.
- Ahead all speed, sir.
4050, 2000 revs.
Good morning.
Come in.
At ease.
- Good morning, sir.
- Sit down.
- Poor show, this.
- Yes, nothing further, I suppose?
We've had a signal.
The Hudson took off at 11:20.
The Air Commodore Waltby was definitely on board.
- It was that one?
- Looks like it.
There's no other aircraft reported overdue.
Not so far anyway.
If they are in the drink, there's a pretty fair chance of their being picked up.
They've got to be picked up.
I've had London on the phone.
Waltby was carrying a briefcase.
It's vital that neither he nor the briefcase shall be lost.
I know Waltby's number one buff on unguided missiles but...
I wonder what was in the briefcase.
It seems our people over there got hold of some papers.
Formula, blueprints, and so on.
Waltby was sent over to identify them.
London had word from him yesterday.
He's got the follow-on to the B-1 and the B-2.
I wonder if the Jerries knew about Waltby.
And deliberately shot them down?
I doubt it.
I'm going to see what's happening.
- Thanks. I'll keep you posted.
- Thank you, sir.
- Ah, Dray.
- Good morning, sir.
- Which is the Hudson?
- Here, sir.
It's only an approximate position, of course, sir.
I can't understand why we didn't get a better one.
Flight Sergeant MacKay is a good wireless operator.
If in fact the signal came from Harding's aircraft.
Oh, quite, sir.
We're only guessing.
There's still time to hear the Force landed somewhere in this country.
- Who picked the signal out?
- They heard that it Fellwell and Harbury.
A weak mayday signal without a call sign...
...lasting just long enough for them to get enough bearing.
Probably Harding's last chip before he ditched.
Yes, sir.
They've apparently got Air Commodore
Waltby with them, of course?
Yes, sir.
Do you know him, sir?
He's my brother-in-law.
The plane's the best part of an hour overdue.
Any shipping in the vicinity?
There are air-sea rescue launches north and south in the area.
What about Coastal Command?
They've got a couple of Sea Otters in the job and the Navy have sent at least one.
There's always the chance of an aircraft in the area picking up the signal, I suppose?
With a squawk box in a dinghy?
Oh, yes.
- What's the picture on the weather?
- A bit dicey, sir.
I'll get Commander Peeple to send someone up.
- Tell him to come to my office, will you?
- Very good, sir.
Main office?
- Good morning, sir.
- Morning, Scotty.
- Do you want me? I'm rather busy.
- I shan't keep you long, sir.
Well, all right.
I found something rather interesting this morning, sir.
Now, sir. What about this?
Rather wizard, I think.
I suggest we hang one up in the mess somewhere, shall we?
You're the adman officer, Scotty.
I leave it to you.
Roger, sir.
I'm just on my way to the canteen to give the boys a lecture on post-war planning.
- I might hang one up there too.
- Oh, you fix it, Scotty,
I'm rather occupied at the moment.
By the way, sir, about this ensign company... who's supposed to be giving a show here on Sunday. I...
Come in.
- Ah, Hart. Well, what's the picture?
- I'm afraid we're in for a nasty blow, sir.
What I really want to talk about, sir, is the new bus service to town.
Deal with it yourself, Scotty.
Roger, sir.
Stoneway reports clouds at 500 ft, heavy rain and a gale-force wind.
No flying.
That's about 400 miles north of here, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.
- How long before it reaches us?
It'll be here by this time tomorrow, if not before.
Just a bright day for flying, that's all we want.
The barometer is falling a little already, sir.
I guarantee that every time anyone ditches...
...the weather immediately starts to make things as difficult as possible.
When I ditched in 1940 it took two days to find me.
I never felt so cold and lonely in all my life.
As a matter of academic interest, has one of these things ever been known to turn over?
Judging by the way this one's behaving at the moment,
I reckon it can turn itself inside out if it tried real hard.
There's a whole lot of water getting in here.
Is there something I can bail with?
That briefcase would make a good bailer.
How about it, sir?
- I think not.
- You could shove the papers in your pockets.
- I think not.
- I don't see why...
Enough, Mac!
Do you think anybody's getting a signal from that thing, Canada?
- Sure, if it's working.
- It's working, all right.
Just as you say, bud.
It's a pity we didn't get a signal out before we ditched.
I hadn't got a chance, had I?
I made out a couple of maydays and the transmitter...
...went to pieces right in front of me eyes.
Sure, so nobody's got a bearing on us.
- At least not a good one.
- I did what I was supposed to do!
Keep your hair on, Mac.
Nobody's fault.
I mean, who'd expect to find a Jerry here at this time of the war?
Anyway, it helps to know he's got a wet behind, too.
It don't help mine any.
How long is it since we came down?
About 4 hours, sir.
It'll be dark in another hour or so.
Think of that.
And me, I had a date tonight.
Not another new popsy, Canada?
Not a new one.
Same as last week. And the week before.
Don't tell me it's the real thing this time.
Sure is. Hell, I didn't pluck up the courage to kiss her for two nights running.
That proves it then, doesn't it?
All right, I'll take it.
Come on, time we had some food.
Let's get the bag, Allan.
Better start on a strict ration right away.
We don't know how long we're going to make this lot last
Is it getting darned cold?
A nice warm blanket would be just the job now.
Look, Steve, here's my jacket.
I don't need it.
I've got a jacket.
You keep yours for yourself.
- But I can get a bang on the guts.
- I don't feel the cold, honest.
Don't be a clod, Mac.
If you don't feel the cold you must be dead or something.
No, you keep your jacket on.
Well, well, well!
Water purifying tablets.
That's gonna be real handy with all this sea around us.
What are those?
Oh, biscuits. They're useful.
And energy tablets.
Say, they think of everything.
Cigarettes, chewing gum...
...compass, and...
My, my, what a delicate thought!
Toilet paper.
All right...
One food tablet and one biscuit each for this meal.
What, no coffee and licors?
Oh, that reminds me.
- Brandy.
- Brandy?
No wonder you didn't want to let that case go, sir.
We'd better keep that till we need it.
What, when we're too weak to taste it?
Not in your life! Let's have it now while we can enjoy it.
Let's die happy.
- What do you think, sir?
- I think a little nip around will do us good.
- Here, you first.
- No, after you.
Carry on.
I got it.
Go on.
Thanks.
Okay, sea, I'm ready for you now.
This would happen to me.
We'll never get back to London now.
I don't know what you're talking about, Tebbitt.
She can't get a train to London till midday tomorrow. So long as we're back by noon...
No, I know the wife.
Of course, blimey, I ought to.
Look, she says here...
If you are not back home tonight
I am going to London.
There is someone there who loves me and who will not leave me alone...
...all the time like you do.
Who is this bloke, have you got any idea?
How should I know, with her living in town and me stuck in camp?
Maybe she only wrote that to put the wind up you.
No, Wilda's always wanted to get back to London.
B1s, B2s, she don't mind.
She misses the pubs, and dance halls, and things like that.
Maybe we'll make it back tonight even yet.
I bet we don't. Even if we do pick up them fellows in the dinghy...
...we'll probably hit a bloody mine or something.
Here, you take over.
- Comfy, Tebbitt?
- That's right.
It's not all right. There's an aircraft over there and it's coming this way in fast.
- Sir, I'd seen it...
- Well, report it, you berk.
Aircraft approaching from starboard.
It's a Sunderland.
Thank you very much!
- What's that, Robby?
- Cocoa.
Give us a cup, will you?
- Any sign of anything yet?
- Nah!
What's up, Flight?
Ah, that Tebbitt.
Drives you up a wall.
He's all right. He's a good boy when it comes to the pick-up.
Oh, sure, they're all good boys when they're on the job.
The problem is keeping them going in between times.
You don't mind that, do you?
You think I like chasing Tebbitt?
It's my job, that's all.
Look at young Milliken.
Do you think I like chasing him?
- He hasn't complain, has he?
- No, he's got guts, all right.
They have to learn the hard way, same as you did.
You were a civilian for the duration, weren't you?
Well, you made it, and so will he.
And the same way.
With punishing flight sergeants chasing from butt holes to breakfast time.
But I was a bit older.
Maybe you were.
But he'll grow old.
I'll see to that.
Oy!
You're the sergeant.
And the sergeant's got to be tough, eh?
That's right.
Ever a Beau Geste.
- How are the engines, baby?
- No complaints.
Bet you're beginning to wish now you hadn't skipped those repairs last night.
Ah, get stuffed, you.
Listen, son.
A damaged oil feed can stop the engines stone dead, and you know it.
All you can do now is hope and be ready.
Ah!
How long is it since we ditched?
About ten hours, I imagine.
Why the hell couldn't look for us in the daylight?
They must be somewhere about.
They can't be far away.
You're the only one who wants to get out of here, bud.
My girlfriend's waiting for me back there.
I reckon in just about an hour
I'll be kissing her good night.
That's all you ever think about, isn't it?
Beer, and girls, and going to the pictures.
Well, I've got other things to think about.
I'm not going to spend the rest of my life in this blasted dinghy.
If the sea gets much rougher, you won't have to worry about that, Mac.
Wait a minute.
Are you all right, Skip?
Yeah, I'm all right.
- A bit stiff.
- A bit stiff.
Here.
Listen, MacKay, and you, Kirby.
If anything should happen to me, this briefcase has got to go overboard, do you understand?
And if we're picked up by an enemy vessel, take the strap of this squawk box, pull it through and tie it tight, and drop it overboard so that it sinks fast.
Did you get that?
Okay, sir.
Is that understood, MacKay?
Why don't you throw it overboard now and have it done with it?
It's brought us only but bad luck.
Listen, MacKay, up to now I haven't reminded you that I have got a certain rank.
When I ask you to do something it's an order.
Did you hear that?
Yes, sir.
Right. We won't talk anymore about the briefcase.
It's about time we did some more exercise. Come on.
It's the damn water we're sitting in.
I've had pins and needles on my behind for the last hour or more.
I can't get rid of it.
Still, if it's just the job for working up an appetite, boy, am I looking forward to my next energy tablet.
- Come on, MacKay!
- Oh, what's the use?
It's a waste of time anyway.
Come on, for goodness' sake.
Do something, stop arguing.
We'll have a song, too.
On and on...
On and on...
Away, pull and tug.
Dear God.
We are four men here... on a pretty tough spot.
I know You've got a lot to think about but... please, try and not forget us.
Our trust is in You.
And if You could possibly see Your way clear getting us somewhere dry, we'd be very grateful.
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
I say, what's the trouble?
It's nothing, sir.
Come along now, you're not crying for nothing.
Nothing, sir, really.
I say...
You're one of the mess clerks, aren't you?
- Yes, sir.
- Well, can't I help?
- That's what I'm here for, you know.
- Yes, sir, I...
I suppose you haven't heard any news of Mr. Harding's crew, have you, sir?
Oh, I see.
Well, uh...
Look, I was just going to see the Group
Captain, I'll find out what's happening.
Who is it you're interested in?
- Sergeant Kirby, sir.
- Your boyfriend, right?
- We're nearly engaged, sir.
- Jolly good show.
You hang on here and I'll let you know.
- Thank you, sir.
- Think nothing of it.
Come in.
- Good evening, sir.
- Evening, Scotty.
- Sorry to bother you so late, sir.
- Is it important?
- I'm afraid so, sir. Any news of Harding?
- No.
Well, this is about Flight Sgt. MacKay.
He's with Harding, isn't he?
MacKay? What about MacKay?
Well, sir, the station police have found a Jerry kind of petrol in his car, you know, that old Morris he runs about in.
Seems it fell off the back of a motor transport...
...and the police corporal spotted MacKay picking it up after dark.
For sure, sir, fetching petrol is a Court Martial offense.
- Has the corporal reported it?
- Yes.
- That means a charge will be made out.
- Afraid so, sir.
MacKay's a good wireless operator.
He was put in for commission with me.
That's right, sir.
It's all he could do altogether.
What do you feel should be the drill?
There was a sergeant at Fell Borough who took a jerry can of petrol, I remember, in similar circumstances. Stealing by finding, I suppose you'd call it.
That's right, sir. Court Martial and reduced at the ranks.
Then, shortly afterwards he was given his rank back...
...and was eventually killed over Essen.
Oh, was he, sir?
I didn't remember that.
No.
Anyway, nothing much can be done about it until MacKay gets back.
If he gets back.
By the way, sir, about this ensign show on Sunday,
I was wondering if we couldn't possibly...
Roger, sir.
Did you find out, sir?
Oh... yes, my dear.
Well, there's no need to worry.
- They're going to be all right.
- You mean they've found him, sir?
Well, they know where they are.
It's just a matter of time.
- He is all right, isn't he, sir?
- Of course he is.
He'll be on the telephone through the
War Effort before you know where you are.
- Now, you run along and don't worry.
- Thank you, sir.
I've been in touch with the Navy at Dover. sir.
If it gets no worse they think the dinghy will rough the night.
- And if it does get worse?
- I'm not so sure.
I wish we knew where they were.
If they can hold out till daylight, there's still a chance.
We'll get everything that can fly off the ground at first light, unless there's thick fog or heavy rain.
- What's the temperature, Howard?
- Low, sir. Cold and raw.
Possibly some frost on the way.
It could be pretty grim out there.
Could you get a new piece of chalk, corporal?
Sorry, sir.
Oh, Flight! 2559 is around.
I've just picked up a signal.
- They've called airmen to search now.
- Very good. Where is she?
Due north of here.
Well, here we go again.
It'll be the usual, Ryce.
Three tours on the point of a pick-up, and each time fire on us was pitiless.
Next time I'll pull out her bungs and scuttle her.
What's this?
I tied us all... all together.
And that... case...
In case one of us..
...went overboard.
Oh, yeah...
- How's the skip.
- I'm all right, Canada.
How's yourself?
Lousy.
Came the dawn.
Skip, would you like some food?
- No?
- No.
This damn wind...
...taking us closer to the Dutch coast all the time.
Where are they?
It can't take them all this time.
They're...
They're just not trying.
Him and his blasted little bag.
What if he has got Jerry secrets in it?
The war's nearly over now.
Pipe down, Mac.
Whining's not gonna get us anywhere.
Bloody charm we're under...
He... he can't fall himself...
...so he has to take us in the drink too.
Oh, the hell, Mac.
He's a nice enough guy.
What's he doing in the Air Force anyway?
Earning his living?
Not likely.
I know his type.
Constable over his camp... pink gins in the mess...
Mac...
I don't think they served any pink gins in the last six weeks.
Why? Did the mess run out of gin or something?
Did you ever make a parachute jump, Mac?
No.
He did. To get all the stuff that's in that bag.
Made his way through...
...occupied territory for heaven knows...
...how many miles to get it back.
Not so many miles, Harding.
Only about 6 km, actually.
Pretty sticky ones, though.
- What's happened to your boots?
- Hm?
Your boots!
Oh, Skipper's got them on.
He only had shoes on.
How are you feeling?
I'm all right.
I don't feel the cold.
He flew through the air with the greatest of ease
The bold, daring man on the flying trapeze.
He flew through the air with the...
One more leg, Ted, then we head for home.
Set out the course, will you, Ted?
Yep.
Wouldn't like to be in the drink in this weather.
Lord knows I'm fed up with these Sea Otters.
To hell with ditching in a kite that won't float.
Accomplished course 270.
Turning at 5 minutes exact.
Roger dodger.
Listen! Listen!
It's one of ours.
Say, Mac, you'll capsize us.
- Where's the flare?
- I've got it.
Wait a minute, Mac.
Let's see the aircraft first.
- There it is!
- Where?
- I can't see it! Where?
- I can, sir. Over there!
- Have you got the flare ready?
- I can't. I'm too cold.
Hey! We're here!
Here we are!
Hey! Hey!
Hey!
Hurry up, man!
It's a Sea Otter. They're searching for us.
Hurry up with that flare!
- Hurry up, man, for God's sake or we'll miss it.
- It won't come, I can't help it!
- Let me try, here!
It's turning away. It's heading south.
It's too late, I'm afraid.
- We're here! Here we are!
- Hey!
Hey! Hey!
It's no good, fellows.
They can't hear us.
No wonder they didn't spot us.
Why weren't you turning that thing?
I was turning it.
Why didn't they hear us then?
Got a hell of a clout when we ditched.
Maybe it's busted.
You're the wireless operator.
You ought to know.
Knock it off you two.
Quarreling won't help.
Nobody's fault.
They're all the same.
They don't care.
They're warm.
Skipper's passed out.
- Wish we could have found them.
- Me too.
The weather's closing in.
If we don't head for home, we'll be in the drink ourselves.
Come on, you old string bag.
Twenty miles an hour flat out.
The wind and tide behind her.
Bloody taxi driver, that's what I am.
Hey, can you see something down there?
- Huh?
- Look!
- Yeah, it looks like a dinghy.
- I'm going down.
It isn't what we're looking for.
It must be a fighter boy.
I'm going down to pick him up.
Made it!
It's rougher than I thought.
Stand by, Ted.
Johnny, it's a Jerry.
Grab the rope!
Hang on tight!
Come on, you sausage-eating baboon!
Don't panic!
We're getting you!
Danke... danke shoen.
Danke shoen.
I wonder if he's seen anything of the other dinghy.
- Did you see another dinghy? No?
- A dinghy.
- No English. No speak English.
- He doesn't speak English.
Where, what happened?
Who shot you down?
Bomber... attack.
Hudson! Must be the one we're looking for.
- Where was it? Where was it?
- Wo war der Hudson?
He must be the character that shot the Hudson down.
They probably got a pop at him and shot him down too.
Better get him back in the damn tub, too.
Yeah, let's get going.
We haven't any time to waste.
Now we're in trouble.
Someday I'm gonna meet the guy that invented these tripe machines.
Better get busy on the buzzer and contact base and tell them where we are.
Then climb out on the wing and see what the score is, will you?
What about him?
He's in pretty bad shape.
I hope he can hold on until they question him.
I hope so.
Danke.
Danke shoen.
- 59's pretty close now.
- Wonder which is gonna pick up the dinghy.
I bet it's 59. You couldn't pick up a curl in the head.
Hold it!
Yes, that's all right.
Procede... immediately... to assistance... of damaged Sea Otter... tow back to base.
That's due south of here.
Away from the search area.
Oh, now, 61 always gets the dirty jobs.
This boat's got a jinx on it.
Visibility's not so good, Flight.
Still good enough to spot trouble, sir.
See what I see?
Full speed!
Skipper! Sea Otter in the drink by the sound of it, sir.
Signal, sir.
Ahoy, there, 61!
I see they're taking you out of the search.
Well, well, well!
Never mind, you're better off doing an honest job of towing.
They're only using us because we can tow the Sea Otter and search.
- Anyway, good luck with the pick-up.
- Keep your trousers dry.
Head off, Flight.
Head off, aye, sir.
We'll never get back before the train leaves now.
- That's me last chance up the spout.
- That's right, chum, you've had it.
I bet she'll be wearing her new coat.
Ten quid that cost me, you know?
With the gloves in the act.
She's daft about money, dead daft.
She said she wanted it to go with her green suitcase I bought her for Christmas.
I bet she takes that with her, too.
Yeah, and the knives, and the forks, and the family jewels.
That's all right for you to talk, you're not married.
No, and after serving in this lot with you, chum, I'm staying that way.
Phooey! After 20 years of this game
I'm posted to a tug.
- Five-man passengers, that's all.
- Oughtn't to be.
- It's just a ship built at the same time.
- They have a better fitter that we have.
Yes, that's true.
Ah, Skinner!
He should have been a tailor.
Al he's interested in is trousers and skirts.
Weather report, sir.
Gale blowing up.
- Do you think they want me, corporal?
- Damn, get out of the way, can't you?
Skinner!
Oh, there you are. What's up?
- The water pumps are packed up, Flight.
- Water pumps?
Yes, sir, both of them.
The engines are overheating.
There's no water coming through.
How is it that both the water pumps are packed altogether, Skinner?
Well, sir, the keys have sheared.
They have a habit of shearing at awkward moments.
What are you going to do about it then?
- Dismantle the pumps and fit new keys.
- How long will it take?
It'll take about 2 hours, sir.
I'll have to make new keys.
- Haven't you any spare keys?
- That's right.
Not like the boat
I was on before, sir.
The fitter there he made spare keys.
They were in his kit.
Why haven't you?
Why not?
- Well, you see...
- Come on, Skinner, out with it!
Well, sir, it's pretty busy down there with only two of us.
- None of the boats have more than 2 fitters.
- Yes, sir, but...
Skinner, how long did it take you to fix the oil feed last night?
It took me about 3 hours, sir.
I don't believe you took 10 minutes at the most!
- How long did it take you?
- Well, it took me about...
Go on, get back there to make those new keys.
I'll sort you out when we get back.
Hang around.
- Knox.
- Yes, sir?
Send a signal to base.
Tell them we've broken down and we can't pick up the Sea Otter.
Sir.
Pick it up, Skinner!
Go on!
- Pick it up and get on with it!
- But, Flight, it's bleeding.
Lovely!
I'd like to see you bleed slowly to death, master-flaming-corporal Skinner.
Go on, get on with it!
I'll just strip off a bit, Flight, it's pretty hot...
There's no time for stripping off, master-flaming-corporal Skinner!
Maybe you'll sweat to death.
If you do, I'll read the burial service when they push you over the side.
I'll be the first to shout per ardua ad astra as you go down.
And you're gonna be hanging I'll bloody well push you down with a boat hook!
Fire away!
I'll be watching you.
- How's it going, son?
- All right, Flight, it's coming off.
How long's it gonna take?
- A day at this rate.
- All day?
Well, the first sea lord here is gonna be back in a couple of hours.
He'll be lucky.
Thanks, Flight.
Launch on stern quarter, sir.
Ahoy, there, 61!
Broken down again?
Never mind, we're on the job.
We'll find the Sea Otter and tow her in.
Much obliged to you!
You're welcome. And we'll come back for you in the morning if you like.
Very funny, ha-ha.
I'll make a note of where you are in case you're not sure.
Shall I give you your position?
I know where I am, thank you.
You'd better let the Navy know we're here.
If this weather gets worse, we might need help.
We'll probably come back for you ourselves.
Have a good day.
You'll get a medal for this.
He knows what he can do with his blasted medals.
Hold on, 61, I'll pass on your message.
Good luck!
All right, you move along, on the bridge.
All right, Flight.
You'll all end up with double pneumonia this flight, I'm telling you.
Milliken, get me some cocoa.
Well, I've been 20 years in the Marine Corps but I never knew anyone like Skinner.
There's a gale warning out, Flight.
Everybody's been recalled.
And we had to stop here. All because of Master Skinner. Ain't it marvelous?
I keep telling you, kid.
There's no Sergeant Kirby here.
We're keeping beds ready and hot-water bottles...
...but they haven't even found them yet.
From what I heard in the ops room they don't even know where they are.
That can't be true!
Squadron Leader Scott definitely said last night that they'd been found.
He was only saying that to cheer you up.
No, he wasn't. He said they knew where the dinghy was and...
Listen to me. If they had found Kirby or any of them, I'd know, wouldn't I?
Sorry, kid. Keep your chin up.
Excuse me.
I couldn't help overhearing.
I'm afraid Sqn. Ldr. Scott misled you.
He meant well, of course.
- They haven't found them then.
- No.
We've had no luck at all so far.
We're assuming they got into their dinghy safely and that they're still afloat.
But we can only guess at where they are.
- But... in this weather, sir?
- I know.
If it's any help to you,
I still honestly believe...
...there's a chance of their being picked up.
Yes. Thank you, sir.
Here.
Let me help you.
Is he going to die, sir?
Do you think he'll be all right?
I hope so.
Must be...
...nearly midday.
He's a nice fellow, Harding.
You like him, don't you?
He'd so the same for me.
It's...
...just the way he is.
The way... he talks, the bloke.
We've been together nearly two years, sir.
Others have... have come and gone.
But... we seem to have stuck,
I don't know why.
Yes, I know how it is.
His dad's got big estates.
Biggest there are in town.
My father's got fruiters and grocers.
In Luton.
It's mine now.
It's time for his water-foolish son...
...to get back to the shop.
I've got an old bloke looking after it but...
...he doesn't care.
No, it's not the same when it's not your own.
- Did you say Luton?
- Eh?
- Luton.
- Yes, do you know it?
That's funny...
You know, you must know my dad.
Why, did you live there, sir?
What is he, the mayor or something?
No, not exactly.
But he must have punched your ticket at the railway station often enough.
He's a porter there. Or he was, till two years ago when he retired.
Oh.
I used to be mad about trains when I was a kid.
Playing about the railway line all the time...
...watching the numbers of the trains and so on.
But Dad always said no. Fly.
Flying is the thing of the future.
Well, I dropped into the RAF but they wouldn't let me fly.
Eye sight test, you know.
Well, well, I was lucky.
I got a scholarship.
I... I'm an engineer, you know.
Yes... I got back into the RAF again in the end. They wanted me.
Some use to them, I suppose.
So... here I am.
I'll put in for my commission.
Do you think I'll get it?
I don't see why not.
You would, if you knew.
Why?
It's a bit soft telling this to an Air Commodore but...
I pinched a Jerry can of petrol...
...the night before we started out on this lot, and it landed in a ditch.
I've got a little car I bought off a bloke, you know... to go down see the shop now and again.
I just slung it in the back.
If anybody's found it...
I've had it.
If that shop goes bust...
I'm finished.
Yes.
This damn weather, this trouble at home, and you can't get back.
By the way, you'd better consider yourself under close arrest.
Oh...
You know...
He always thought...
...that he'd come and get his groceries from me...
...even if he had to cycle from Gloucestershire.
That's where he lives.
He will, Mac.
So help me, bud, he will.
Where do you think we are now, Kirby?
Somewhere off the coast of Belgium,
I reckon, sir.
There's a chance we may be washed up on...
...enemy territory then.
Well, at least he'd be safe and warm in hospital.
How's your hand, Mac?
Can't even feel it, sir.
That reminds me.
Time we had another ration.
See if you can reach that thing and...
...chuck it over, will you?
If I can.
With the other hand.
Thanks.
Do you think that...
...Sea Otter will...
...ever come back again?
Not exactly flying weather, is it?
Not ideal.
What about the air-sea rescue?
As my old grandma used to say...
Patient, ever patient, enjoy, so be thy share.
- Got it?
- Thank you, sir.
Oh, God!
I hate the bloody sea!
Is that the dinghy?
According to the Navy, yes, sir.
They've questioned that German pilot they brought in pretty closely, and allowing for wind and the tide, that's about it, sir.
- As close in as that.
- As close in as that.
If she's still afloat.
The Navy says she'll be right by the beach this evening...
...in occupied territory.
- Are both our launches still out of it?
- Yes, sir.
2559 is due at any time now with the Sea Otter.
2561 I reckon will be able to operate in a couple of hours.
Look!
Look what's happened to my best jacket.
Look at it! Look what's happened to my best jacket.
- Look what's happened.
- Good!
Nothing like a spot of oil for a two-bit, Skinner.
You'll have to get it off.
Got to wash it, like I do.
Maybe it'll keep you in at nights.
Go on, keep firing.
- What are you doing, bosseye?
- Yes, Flight.
The big swan wants his head examined.
How long is this likely to last?
Robbie seems to think we won't get the full force of the gale.
We're somewhere on the edge of it.
What do you think, Timmy?
Maybe I should have walloped her, given her what for, showed her who was boss.
No, that good-for-no-good, she'd just gone off sooner, wouldn't she, eh?
Well, what do you think, Gusser?
I'll tell you what I think, chum.
Somewhere out there there's four blokes in a dinghy.
They've been out there all night.
And if they're not dead already, they're sitting out there depending upon you and me to go and find them.
So if you don't stop whining about that silly wife of yours,
I'm gonna pick you up and chuck you right over the side, personally.
All right, all right, I was only asking.
Come on, it's time you and I go on watch.
Milliken, put the kettle on.
Robbins will be down in a minute, he'll want a cup of tea.
Okay, corporal, Tobey's in the way.
He asked for Flight.
Okay.
Do you think we'll be back before dark, Flight?
What's the matter? Can't you sleep without a night light?
What about the skipper?
- Going to Gosport.
- Yes...
Ever been to Gosport?
- No.
- I have.
I was stationed there in the old days.
Yeah, we've gone a long way since then.
And what have we got?
We've got radar, wireless, loops, launches with vast engines and patent logs.
With that and a fishing crew you're up a well-known creek.
Excuse me. I think I've set the boat on fire.
Fire!
Get down below!
It's all over here, sir.
- Where is he?
- Check the upper deck, the cabin.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- This is a fine bloody mess.
Who's responsible for this?
I am, sir.
Flt. Sgt., I want the full facts before we get back.
Milliken...
They'll probably shoot you for this.
But I was only trying to put the kettle on for a cup of tea.
If they don't shoot you, you'll be paying for this boat for the rest of your life.
Keep out of my way till we get back.
Now get up top.
You're doing bridge watch.
- Bridge watch, what's that?
- Keeping your silly eyes open, that's all.
You keep sitting on your old mat all day. Go, get up there!
Tobey, you follow him.
- Don't take your eyes off him.
- Okay, Flight.
- Well done, Tebbit.
- Thanks, very much.
- Clear this muck up.
- That's gonna take hours!
We've got all day!
I shouldn't have cared if we all blowed up.
What have I got to live for?
Hey! Come on, Guy Fawkes.
- How are you feeling now?
- Like death.
Why don't you sit in the wheel house?
I'll stand your watch for you.
Thanks, Corp, but I think I'd better stay here.
I'm not very popular with the Flight
Sergeant at the moment.
All I did was put a match to it and it blew up in my face.
Oh, forget it.
I know it was an accident.
The Flt. Sgt. doesn't think so.
- He's a bit of a terror, isn't he?
- He's gotta be.
After all, the Flight Sergeant's got to be tough.
He's all right.
You watch him if you run into any trouble. You'll see.
Hey, skipper.
Kraut firing ahead!
Launches.
Yeah.
And more than one by the sound of it.
I heard them.
And the firing, too.
You'll get a bloody medal, you will.
- They're due east of us, sir.
- And they're not HSLs.
You bet your life they're not.
They're right in the middle of eboat tally here.
I suppose they couldn't be
Navy boats, could they?
Yeah, they could.
But not our Navy.
The enemy.
I hope they don't run into us before
Skinner gets his engines going again.
We've got to make this pick-up.
All right, you bunch of heroes, get back to your holes... we're not dead yet.
Did you hear that?
There's firing.
Canada!
Canada! They've come, they've come!
Hold...
Hold the flare, Mac.
Let's see them first.
They might be Jerries.
Why should they be?
They must be ours.
They must.
Hear that?
But they... they must be our chaps.
They must...
Testing their guns around here?
No, they're Jerries all right.
That means we must have drifted south faster than we expected.
Yes, sir.
My guess is we're... we're somewhere off the mouth of the Scheldt.
How far off, do you think?
Well, unless... the wind changes...
...or the tide...
...we'll be inshore before nightfall.
Right under the nose of their shore batteries.
That washes out any chance of a rescue.
- There they are.
- Where?
There.
Two of them, see?
I... I knew it.
They're Jerries.
- What do we do now, sir?
- Wait.
Wait?
We're not going to give up ourselves now.
We'll be on the beach by nightfall.
You said so.
And Skipper... it'll be too late.
They may not have seen us yet.
There's still a chance of a rescue.
What's so good of being rescued if he's dead?
He's had as much as he can take.
We all have.
Haven't you got any pity?
Look at him.
He's dying, I tell you!
He's dying!
I've got to get this case back to England even if we all die.
There's just a chance they may be looking for us.
- For us, sir?
- Or this case.
They've passed us by.
No!
What are you up to, man?
For God's sake, man, what are you doing?
MacKay, MacKay, let go.
Give me that!
Give it!
- I'm gonna do it!
I'm gonna...
- It's time. It's time!
- MacKay, listen to me!
Millions of lives are... Listen!
There are millions of lives that we can save...
...if I can only get this case of mine back home.
Come on, Mac.
For God's sake, believe me, man.
He's right, you know, Mac.
Excuse me, sir.
You'll excuse me speaking to you, you're Group Commander Todd, aren't you?
- Yes.
- I've seen you at the dances.
- Oh, I'm uh...
- I'm Mrs. Tebbitt.
Oh, Mrs. Tebbitt.
- Yes.
My husband was due back from patrol last night and he hasn't turned up.
- What launch is he in?
Are you planning to catch this train?
Yes.
Yes, I am. I'm going to London.
- At least I...
- Mrs. Tebbitt.
There are four men down in a dinghy.
They're somewhere in the North Sea.
About their only chance now is for launch 2561 to find them.
Oh.
Excuse me. I've got to break the news to someone.
- Hello, Chris, dear.
- Hello, Eve.
How nice of you to come and meet me.
- Where's Clive?
- He's not here. Eve.
Don't tell me I've come all this way...
What is it, Chris?
Has something happened?
I'm afraid Clive's missing, Eve.
The aircraft he was traveling back in yesterday morning failed to arrive.
There's a crew of three with him.
We believe they're in a dinghy.
Dinghy?
Message from headquarters, sir.
Must be highly secret. I can't decode it.
Flight.
Aye, aye.
- Congratulations, sir.
- Thanks, Flight.
I told you that coat would fit a boy.
- Any reply, sir.
- Yes, send a signal.
When do the new childs allow us to start?
When do the new childs allow us to start?
I hope we get back soon, Flight.
It's gone 2 o'clock. That's me lot.
She's left me.
Here... you don't have it, you know.
Well, I did.
She's on her way to London by now.
I shall never see her again.
And a damn good job, too,
'cause I'm jolly well sick of her.
- Where's the captain.
- On the bridge with Chiefy.
- Well, they're all right. We can start.
- The engines are okay?
- I said we can start.
- Right.
- Engines are ready, sir.
- Good, and about time, too.
All right, start them up.
Marshall, send the signal to base.
- We're ready to continue the search.
- Very good, sir.
Blythe, go ahead all speed,
1000 revs.
Come in.
Well, Scotty, what is it this time?
- I thought you'd want to see this, sir.
- What is it?
It's a charge sheet made out against Flt. Sgt. MacKay.
- You haven't wasted much time.
- No, sir.
- Any news of the dinghy?
- No, there isn't.
Did all you could do, sir.
I suppose this will have to go through.
But if he comes ashore alive, he will be dealt with lightly, or I'll know the reason why.
Yes, sir. Still it's jolly unpatriotic, you know. I mean, pinching petrol...
- Don't behave like a club man!
- Yes, sir... Very good.
- Oh, one thing more.
- Yes, sir?
This little WAF, Sgt. Kirby's,
I gather you told her last night...
- ...he was safe and on his way back.
- I was trying to cheer her up.
She's only a child, you know.
She didn't behave like a child when I told her the facts.
Sorry, sir.
I seem to make rather a muck of things all around.
Come in.
Signal from 2561, sir.
- They're ready to resume the search.
- Right, I'll come.
- May I talk to you of the dance on Sunday, sir?
- No.
- Oh, no news yet, I'm afraid.
- Thank you, sir.
Where do you reckon the dinghy should be now?
Just about here, sir.
- Right in close to enemy shore.
- Forecast for that area is mist lifting rapidly.
It means the Jerries are bound to spot them.
Yes...
How long would it take 2561 to get to that position?
About an hour, sir.
45 minutes, maybe.
Right. Signal them to make an in-shore search in that area.
Yes, sir.
It's a devil of a place for a launch to go right out to the shore batteries.
- That is not all of it, sir.
- Hm? What else?
This is an enemy mine field.
I think it's about time we did some exercises again, huh?
- Land!
- Where?
- I saw land.
- Huh?
I saw land over there.
- Look, there it is.
- Where?
- See it?
- Yes, I can see it now that the mist is lifting.
Houses.
Real houses.
Well... we're close in.
Belgian coast.
South of Antwerp.
That'll be nice.
Right in Jerry's lap.
Listen!
It's only waves.
No, it sounded louder than that.
It's a sand bank.
We're inside it.
If it dries out at low tide... they'll be able to walk out and pick us up.
At least you'll be all right.
All I've got to look forward to is a court martial.
If we can get this briefcase back to England safely... you'll find it'll weigh more than a Jerry can of petrol.
Well, if anyone wants to pick us up now...
...they'll have plenty of fun.
- Will you make us some tea, Knox?
- Tea? Hot-water bottles in case of shock.
- Oughtn't I to do that?
- You did enough damage last time.
You get up on deck and keep your eyes open.
The shore's only over there through the mist.
We've got just about enough petrol to get us out.
Keep searching.
Aye, sir.
Thank goodness for this mist.
At least they can't see us from the shore.
A launch.
- A launch, they've found us.
- Where, man, where?
Over there.
I saw it for a second, then...
Then it disappeared.
- It's nothing.
- I tell you I saw a launch.
Air-sea rescuer, or I'm crazy.
Get the flare out, will you?
Make sure that it works this time.
Come on, where is it?
There!
There she is.
- Shout!
- Hey!
- For God's sake, shout!
- Hey! Hey!
It's no good attracting mensches at that distance
Get the flare out, Mac, go on!
Hey...Hey...
- I can't. You... you do...
The whistle!
Blow the whistle, Mac.
The mist is lifting.
It's a bit disappointing though, coming all this way without making the pick-up.
Blarmey, Tebbitt, you're human after all.
Thanks very much, Flight.
Flare, Flare!
Flight, a red flare.
Sir, a red flare over there!
That's all, hold it.
- There she is, sir!
- It's a dinghy, sir! It's a dinghy!
Stand by to pick-up!
On posts! Keep your eyes keen everybody.
The shore's somewhere over there.
Come on, get below, Milliken.
You've got work to do, come on.
She's coming.
She's coming towards us.
Shout, boys.
Shout like hell.
Hey! Hey!
- Hey!
- Hey!
We go uptide to the south side of the sand bank and come out the other end.
Aye, aye, sir.
Skinner, up on deck!
Let's have all of you up on deck!
We may need you.
Full speed ahead on all three.
- They've seen us, Flight!
- Here it comes!
Pretty rotten shots, aren't they?
Any menace they all start up.
One more like that, that's all we want, just one more like that.
Come on, hurry up!
Get a move on.
All together!
Right, lift!
Steady as you go!
- Are you all right, sir?
Don't worry about me, watch the dinghy.
We've got do this damn quickly.
Take the wheel.
You'll be all right, chums.
You'll be on board a train in a minute.
- Hey, Tebbitt!
- All right, sir.
Try to get a move on.
- I got it. Watch out chap.
- Okay, get her away!
Head off!
Hold your breath, boy!
We did it!
We bloody well did it!
Tebbitt!
- You all right?
- They must have chucked the gun at me.
- I'll get you an order to sick bay.
- And an all clear, Flight.
All clear?
Do you hear that noise?
The sweetest music in the world.
The engines making for home.
How are you, Clive?
- Hello, Chris.
- It's good to see you.
Good luck, sir.
- Thanks. Come see me later.
- I will, sir.
Okay, now?
Yes.
You?
Fine.
See you later.
Thank you, Treherne.
You did a great job.
The doctor said you'll be on your feet in a matter of weeks.
That'll suit me fine, sir.
Have a nice stretch of convalescence leave.
Give you time to get to know your son.
I'd like that, sir.
Congratulations.
Thank you all very much.
Thank you, sir.
- Well, how do you feel?
- Oh, I'll be fine in a couple of days.
I'm glad Eve took it so well.
Oh, by the way, I wanted to talk to you sometime about that Flt. Sgt. MacKay.
Funny you should mention that.
I wanted to talk to you about him.
How's Flight Officer Harding?
Oh, he'll be okay, Sergeant.
We got him just in time.
- How was it?
- Oh, a bit dodgy.
But we held them off, you know?
Here, Milliken!
A fag?
Oh, thanks, Flight.
I thought you did a favor to us all.
You made a pick-up.
You're one of God's chosen few.
Enjoy the trip?
I never thought we'd get back.
Get back? Get back?
After a pick up like that I'd have swum under the basket and carried her home.
I bet you would, Flight.
Now come on, son, don't keep the ambulance waiting. You're wounded, aren't you?
Oh, it's nothing. I feel a bit hungry.
I thought I'd go down to the cookhouse.
All them WAFs!
Come on, Robbie.
Subtitles: Luís Filipe Bernardes
Since the first revelation of the atom bomb at Hiroshima in 1945... the United States, England and Russia... have been experimenting with more and more increasingly deadly weapons.
Every day, there is more concentration on the race for atom supremacy.
Sometimes machines and men, such as Carl Noymann... are driven beyond the line of endurance.
And when that happens...
In Washington, the accident became the subject of an intense discussion... by high-ranking officials.
Dr. Penner, science is your business.
Protecting this country is mine.
You say we should call an immediate end to nuclear experimentation.
- But you know that's impossible.
- Then limit it to experiments for peace.
We've been over all this before.
After what happened,
I thought you might think differently.
That's why I flew here.
General, since I can't change your mind...
I am resigning from the Commission.
- I want nothing more to do with the project.
- You're being panicked by one incident.
Panicked? The area around Dr. Noymann's laboratory won't be livable for years.
Every test made since the explosion yesterday... shows pollution of our atmosphere, the air we breathe.
Every precaution is being taken to protect the people in that district.
- Decontamination crews are...
- Are what?
Cleansing the air?
Straining it, as you would dirty water?
Radioactive particles have been blown into space.
Who can tell when those particles will come down to Earth again?
You don't even know what lasting effect... they might have on the space around the Earth.
Dr. Penner, please reconsider.
The Commission can't afford to lose its top man.
Sorry, but I think my attitude now... would be more of a hindrance than a help to the Commission.
I'm going to fly home in time for Carl Noymann's funeral... and I'm not coming back to Washington.
Goodbye, General.
Carl Noymann and I were friends since childhood.
We grew to manhood sharing the same goal.
Science for the benefit of humanity.
Somewhere, our ideals were lost... and Carl Noymann died because of it.
A deadly weapon he was helping to create killed him.
But Carl Noymann hasn't died in vain.
His death has served a purpose... to bring me back to my senses.
I've found again the ideals
Carl and I once had.
From now on, my work will be devoted to the aid of humanity... not its destruction.
I have made my pledge to you, Carl.
May God rest your soul.
- How is he?
- Asleep. He's exhausted.
I'm sorry your father resigned from the Commission.
It puts us on opposite sides of the fence.
It's become an obsession with him.
I hope he gets over it.
I'm sure he will.
I'd better get some sleep.
I have to catch an early plane back to
Washington the first thing in the morning.
It's good seeing you again, Phyllis.
It's been a long time, John.
- I'll drive you downtown.
- Wonderful.
I'm glad you could fly in for the funeral.
I know Dad appreciates it.
I'll call and see how he is before I leave in the morning.
Carl!
Adam Penner, you will listen carefully.
You can't be Carl. You can't be.
No.
This is the corpse of an Earthman who was known as Carl Noymann.
Earthman?
I am from another planet, outside your galaxy.
I'm sorry. I just don't understand.
Adam Penner, you can save the people of Earth from total destruction.
Unless Earth surrenders in 24 hours, we will begin a mass invasion.
This is fantastic.
You expect me to believe that you can overrun the entire world?
Your scientists think that the moon is a dead planet.
That it is uninhabited. It is not.
You're a madman. We know it is.
More than 20,000 years ago, my planet invaded the moon... and destroyed the life that existed there.
We have controlled the moon since then... and made it an impregnable base for our spaceships.
- We'd have seen signs of life there.
- You would see nothing.
We are invisible.
We are invisible, Adam Penner.
Long ago we learned to change the molecular structure of our bodies.
You cannot see us.
I am using this dead man's body so that I can communicate with you.
Why do you want us to surrender?
What do you want of Earth?
We have studied your languages and your many civilizations... for thousands of years.
We have never bothered Earth because of its slow scientific development.
But now you are approaching the Space Age.
You are testing nuclear and rocket devices for travel into space.
As we have put the moon and many other planets under our rule... it is now time for us to put Earth under our rule.
Dictatorship of the universe!
We cannot be defeated.
We have never been defeated.
Just as I have done with the dead body of Carl Noymann... my people will come to your planet... and inhabit the bodies of other dead Earthmen.
The dead will kill the living.
And the people of Earth will cease to exist.
That is the message you will bring your people.
Why me? Why did you choose me?
Your voice has been the loudest for peace.
You have demanded that the nations... stop the manufacture of nuclear weapons for war.
Adam Penner, if you want peace... you will tell your people to surrender now and avoid war.
They'll never surrender. They'll fight.
As fast as you can land your spaceships here, they'll destroy them.
Hold out your hand.
What is it?
The material from which our spaceships are constructed.
We have made everything on our planet invisible.
- That sound...
- Look closely.
You are holding the material from which we build our ships.
Without this device, you cannot see it.
Now that you know you cannot find our ships to destroy them... you will bring the message to your people.
They won't listen. Nobody will believe me.
You have had your warning.
- John, please be patient with him.
- Of course.
I know that this won't interfere with your plans to return to Washington.
We'll see. Besides, it gives me a little more time to see you.
When I came home and found that he actually believed that fantastic story...
- I had to turn to someone.
- I'm glad you came back to the hotel for me.
I'm sure all he needs is a little rest.
Dad.
- You brought John back?
- Yes, I'm here, Adam.
- Phyllis told you about it?
- Yes.
This has to be just something in your mind.
A nightmare. You know that, don't you?
The corpse of Carl Noymann was in this room.
- It was no nightmare.
- Oh, Dad.
And I'm not insane, Phyllis.
I'm not having a breakdown.
Try to understand. There's no time to argue.
Don't ask me to get proof.
I can't explain what happened tonight.
I'm not going to try. All I know is... that we're all just 24 hours away from destruction.
Adam, in heaven's name!
Phyllis told me that you want me to go to Washington... to alert them about this crazy idea.
You must!
Do you expect them to believe such a thing?
Not from me, not after the things
I've said to them about the nuclear tests.
- But they might believe you.
- You're asking me to make a fool of myself.
In 24 hours, John, you might not be alive... to enjoy that precious career of yours.
Please, John?
Adam, I owe you a great deal.
Everything I know, you taught me.
I don't want to do this, for both our sakes.
But, if that's what you want,
I'll go to Washington... and tell them what you said.
Then hurry. Every hour counts.
Now make them realize that.
I'll be in Washington in a few hours.
I'll try, that's all I can promise.
Goodbye, Phyllis.
If Carl had only left me some proof, something to convince them...
Dear Lord, I pray that I am insane... that all that happened is only in my mind.
I pray that tomorrow the sun will shine again on living things.
Not on a world where only the dead walk the Earth.
- Well, John?
- I see you've read the papers, Adam.
Wasn't there anyone who'd listen to you?
He tried, Dad. John really did try.
All you've succeeded in doing is making laughing stocks out of both of us.
I hope you're satisfied.
I want to believe that I'm out of my mind,
John, but I can't.
You've been with me all day, hon.
Was I rational?
Yes.
He was, John, every minute.
I'd know. He's not sick.
I don't know what to say, Phyllis.
At 11:30, the 24 hours will be up.
We need time.
They must give it to us. They must.
You honestly believe you can contact these... invisible things again?
I don't know. But we have to try.
Where? How, Dad?
The one I talked to was using
Carl Noymann's body.
- Perhaps if we go to the cemetery...
- Adam!
We've nothing to lose, John. Please.
Like I told you, he's not sick.
I'll drive.
If you are here, if you can see me... or hear me... please, I must talk to you.
I beg you, I plead with you, in the name of humanity... please, let me have this one chance to speak.
Speak, Adam Penner.
I tried to do what you wanted.
You failed, Adam Penner.
No one would listen. We must have time.
Please, give me time to try again.
Your voice is not enough.
You are alone, Adam Penner.
You cannot succeed.
But the people of Earth will have one more warning.
How? What will you do?
One more warning. That is all.
Listen.
I don't hear anything.
That rasping sound, the breathing.
It's stopped. They're gone.
What do you believe now, John?
What can we do? What can we possibly do?
Nothing.
The warning will come.
Then it'll be up to the world.
It's out of our hands.
The first warning came in the wake of a fatal air crash... outside Syracuse, New York.
The pilot had been killed.
But, within minutes, his lifeless body was inhabited... by one of the invisible invaders.
Girard back to Fontaine. Fontaine shoots.
The puck is deflected.
It hits the cage and goes off to one side.
The invader, using the pilot's body... had come to issue the first public threat to the people of Earth.
Icing is called. They'll have to bring the puck all the way back to Rover ice.
People of Earth, this is your last warning.
Unless the nations of your planet surrender immediately... all human life will be destroyed in a war you cannot win.
The invader, finished with the corpse... left it and again became invisible.
The second warning came in California.
People of Earth... this is your last warning.
Unless the nations of your planet... surrender immediately... all human lives will be destroyed.
And the entire world has felt the shock of sudden and very strange warnings... delivered by some sort of invisible life from another planet.
At this very moment, every capital in the world... has called an emergency meeting to discuss a unified defense of the Earth.
Apparently, there is no indication that any of the nations intend to surrender... as demanded by the invaders.
People of Earth, our warnings have been ignored.
The invasion of Earth has started.
Within three days... the dead will destroy all the living and we will rule the earth.
For the human race, this is the end of existence.
By late that same afternoon, the invaders had instigated... a worldwide reign of terror with sabotage.
Buildings and industrial plants were hit by explosions.
Large dams in the United States, Holland...
Finland and Russia were blown up... flooding the areas around them, inundating towns and cities... killing thousands.
Bridges leading to key military installations were destroyed... stopping all traffic to these vital centers.
Throughout the entire world, the dead are leaving cemeteries... to attack the living.
Walking dead who kill, but cannot be killed.
Horror, fear and panic have turned the civilized peoples of the Earth... into howling mobs.
It is impossible to estimate the death toll... since many of our news headquarters in other nations have been destroyed.
Just a moment.
We have a bulletin from Washington.
Dr. Adam Penner has again taken charge of the Atom Commission.
He and other top scientists are being sent to laboratories in underground bunkers... throughout the United States, where they will try to find... methods of fighting the invasion of the invisible enemy.
Well, that must be John now.
- I was afraid you weren't going to make it.
- We just about did.
- Miss Penner, Major Jay.
- How do you do?
The Pentagon had assigned
Major Bruce Jay, of the Air Force... to escort the group to one of the underground bunkers...
27 miles outside of town.
The news said there was fighting in the Lawnhurst area.
- Bunker 4's been cut off.
- We'll try Number 6.
- Can't we stop them at all?
- They're sabotaging large installations.
- It's our job to find some sort of weapon.
- What about the others on the Commission?
27 scientists have been moved to other underground bunkers.
They'll be working on this project, also.
Here, can I help you?
All right, hang on.
Maj. Jay, who had been briefed thoroughly... in the operation of the complex underground bunkers... was to afford whatever protection he could for the scientists.
The walking dead were everywhere now.
A vast army of destruction that could not be killed.
Just keep your hands up where I can see them.
I got no way of getting out of this part of the country, except on foot.
- I want that jeep you're driving.
- This is an official mission. Get off the road.
You think you're better than I am?
You think you got a right to live, and I ain't?
I seen them walking dead things.
I seen them.
Joe Anderson and his wife drowned two weeks ago.
Now walking through the fields again.
Walking and killing.
I'll give you three to get out of that car, then I'm shooting. One!
All right, get out.
Don't do anything to make him nervous.
He's out of his head.
- What are you gonna do?
- Just get out.
Two!
You killed him.
Maybe you've got some answers this country needs.
Anyway, we're only a few miles from the bunker.
I wasn't going to let him stop us.
Everybody get back in the jeep.
I said get back in the jeep!
The jeep arrived without further incident at the camouflaged entrance... of Bunker Number 6, which had been built to be bombproof... in the event of an all-out atom-bomb war.
The control panel's over there, everything's marked.
Shut the door. I'll meet you in the lab.
Able Fox Niner Six on May Day Channel 1.
Calling May Day Homer.
This is Able Fox Niner Six. Over.
May Day Homer to Able Fox Niner Six.
Just a moment, sir. Gen. Stone?
- It's Major Jay, on Number Six.
- Then he got through all right?
Yes. Maj. Jay, Dr. Lamont,
Prof. Penner and his daughter.
Good.
Major Jay, listen carefully, all of you.
A worldwide state of extreme emergency exists.
The federal government has been evacuated from Washington.
Total military and scientific mobilization has been ordered.
Attempts to negotiate with the invaders have proven hopeless.
Continuing efforts by the military to destroy the invaders have failed.
Hold on, General, be right with you.
Remote Geiger counter shows high radioactivity outside.
All of you, turn off those white switches, quick.
We're all right now.
Those switches hermetically seal the bunker.
Make it bombproof, safe from almost anything.
But why the high radioactivity outside?
We'd hear, or at least feel, any nuclear explosion... close enough to give a reading like that.
The radioactivity isn't constant.
It goes up and down.
Cyclic pulsation?
Doesn't make any sense at all.
As if the wind were blowing radioactivity in, then out, then in?
Or a line of something going past one at a time.
- We better take a look.
- Look?
Closed-circuit TV wasn't affected by the jamming.
They've found us.
No, not yet they haven't. But they're looking.
And that's the reason why.
The walking dead, inhabited by the invisible enemy... had left their spaceship nearby to search for the scientists.
So far, it looks like they don't know the bunker's here.
You were right.
The invaders occupying those dead bodies are highly radioactive.
Able Fox Niner Six to May Day Homer. Over.
- What happened?
- Invaders outside the bunker looking for us.
We picked them up with the Geiger counters.
We've already discovered they're highly radioactive.
Unfortunately, we can't give you any help.
No one's been able to come up with a clue to stop the invaders.
We don't know how you're going to do the job... but you must find some weapon to stop the invaders.
You'll use May Day S.O.X. for your reports.
Good luck to you.
Good luck to all of us. Over and out.
Roger Wilco. Over and out.
Well, you heard him. Any ideas?
Every scientist in the world must be working on this.
How do they expect us to hold out long enough in this prison?
Those things out there are breathing down our necks.
We're all scared, Dr. Lamont.
You're not alone.
Sorry. When I saw that farmer you killed walking past the bunker...
I don't see any point of your being insulting about it.
I'm in charge of this outfit.
We've got a job to do, and we're gonna do it, now.
I'm sure that Dr. Lamont and my father realize that.
Since this started,
I've seen a lot of men crack up mentally... like that farmer out there, but we need you.
You can't afford the luxury of cracking up.
John, the Major is right.
We're all gonna need sleep by tonight.
The work can't stop, so we'll have to sleep in four-hour shifts.
- Agreed?
- Agreed.
- You gonna need your daughter?
- Not until she has to take some notes for us.
All right.
You'll find everything you need here.
If it isn't here, it doesn't exist.
Miss Penner, you'll help me with the supplies.
Meanwhile, the sabotage by the invaders... went on in ever-increasing fury.
Government buildings, communications units... warehouses, army supply depots... railroad and air terminals were the victims of incendiaries... completely demoralizing the high commands... of the armed services of every nation in the world.
May Day Homer to Able Fox Niner Six.
This is Able Fox Niner Six.
Major Jay. Over.
Major, Gen. Stone. Is Dr. Penner there?
Yes, sir. Right next to me.
We can't hold out here much longer.
Any progress there?
Nothing definite, sir.
Maybe this will be of some help.
We've been able to establish a definite pattern.
The invaders either have no weapons of their own, which is unlikely... or the ones they do have won't work in our atmosphere.
General, this is Dr. Penner.
What about the sabotage, the explosions, the fires?
All created by our own weapons against us.
Then their only weapon, actually, is the fact that they're invisible.
That's right. Dr. Harkov, in Moscow, believes there must be a weakness... in the molecular structure of their basic materials... their metals, in Earth's atmosphere.
It might also indicate a weakness in the molecular structure of their bodies.
Thanks, General. This might help.
We'll report back in two hours, sir.
- Right.
- Over and out.
Shall I wake up Lamont and your daughter?
Not yet. They've only had a little over an hour's rest.
I want to work on this new aspect alone for a while.
Dr. Penner... do you still feel the same way about the testing of nuclear weapons?
Yes, Major, I think I do.
If the Lord wills it, we'll come out of this alive.
Then, perhaps, the nations of the world will realize it's possible to work together... as they're doing now... instead of trying to destroy each other with nuclear bombs.
You didn't sleep much.
I thought I heard the radio.
Gen. Stone had something for us.
- Your father thought it might be a lead.
- Can I help?
He wants to work on it alone.
You hate my guts, don't you?
You killed a man in cold blood this morning.
I keep seeing his face.
So do I.
I fought all the way through Korea.
Probably killed a lot of men.
But I never saw their faces.
Dropping a bomb from a plane isn't quite so personal.
Can I make you some coffee?
No, thanks. I've had enough already.
It was either your father or the man with the shotgun.
I had to make a choice.
Perhaps I was wrong about John, too.
What about?
The way you insulted him.
You had to make that choice, too.
Well, he was going off the deep end.
It worked, didn't it?
At least, it was better than slugging him.
I majored in Psychology at college... but I'll take a few lessons from you, Major.
Yeah, sure.
If there's anything left of this world after we get out of here, we'll talk about it.
About Lamont, you two majoring in each other?
Lamont and I...
Phyll.
Get John for me, please. Hurry.
Find something?
I'm not sure it'll work.
It's going to take some courage to find out.
Major, one of us will have to leave the bunker.
What is it, Adam?
I told you of the device used by the invader who contacted me.
- The thing that made the metal ore visible.
- Yes.
Since this morning, I've been working on the theory that the device... may have projected a ray of some sort.
Now, only two theories seem to make any sense.
That the ray changed the light spectrum, or that it temporarily changed... the molecular structure of the ore itself.
Dr. Penner.
You said one of us would have to leave the bunker.
- Why?
- I'm getting to that, Major.
Before I can test either of the theories... we'll have to capture one of the invaders to test it on.
- That's a pretty tall order.
- We have no choice.
We'll have to bring one of the creatures into the bunker.
How can you possibly capture something you can't see?
There's a fire-foam spray among our equipment.
Can you convert it to handle an acrylic spray?
Acrylic spray?
A liquid plastic mixed with a catalyst that... covers and solidifies on contact, forms a hard shell.
The stuff used to mothball
Navy equipment and tanks.
If I can convert the gun, then what?
I believe... the invisible creatures enter a dead body through the pores of the skin.
Sort of an osmosis process.
And the acrylic spray will seal the body so the invader can't get out?
It's only a theory. I said it might not work.
We can't take this chance.
One of them might escape in the bunker.
None of us would be safe.
Maybe there's another way.
Maybe there's something else...
If there is another way, we haven't got time.
Dr. Penner, you get on with the spray.
I'll try and convert the gun.
Phyllis.
They've no right to put you in such danger.
Haven't they, John?
By 11:30 of the first night... the nations of Earth were close to total defeat.
All through the night,
Dr. Penner and Dr. Lamont... labored to manufacture the acrylic formula.
Meanwhile, Major Jay, with the help of Phyllis Penner... converted the fire-foam gun so that it could use the liquid plastic.
By dawn, they had succeeded.
Remember, if I don't make it, you'll have to try again.
They won't quit now.
You asked about John and me.
We're just old friends. That's all.
I'm glad I asked.
All clear.
All clear.
Okay, open the door.
There's enough radiation out there to kill you. Please be careful.
This suit's tough. I'll be all right.
The Geiger counter. Something's coming.
- He got him.
- Wait.
He didn't finish the spray.
No!
We can use the truck to get to him.
Look.
He's leaving.
If he gets far enough away, we won't need the truck.
Now!
Thanks. I'm all right.
The spray gun won't work.
It's not fast enough.
However, I still think the acrylic spray is the answer.
When I hit the body with it, the invader took off fast.
- He was afraid of it.
- But how can we use it?
Well, that depends on Lamont's nerves.
Major, you've been trying...
All right, all right, take it easy. Relax.
I need your help. I'm asking for it.
My life will be in your hands, and I don't want to go into this thing with... two strikes against me.
- What do you want me to do now?
- I'll tell you in a minute.
Dr. Penner, can you make up a large amount of this spray?
- We might.
- All right.
We're gonna have to move fast now, after what's happened.
Have any of you wondered why I wasn't killed by that invader?
You said the invader was frightened by the spray.
That's right.
The spray was more important than I was.
He probably went back to his spaceship... to report we were getting close to something that might bother them.
Now they'll double their forces to find our bunker and knock it out.
It will also mean the entire area around here will be filled with them.
That's why only two of us will leave.
Phyllis and Dr. Penner will stay here.
If we're not back, there'll be someone left to keep working.
- There's only one radiation suit.
- That's all we need.
You'll stay in the cab of the truck.
It's protected.
As you say.
All right, let's get busy on the spray.
I'll explain what I have in mind.
Knowing the invader's spaceship must be in the area...
Major Jay chose a likely spot to set his trap for catching one of the enemy.
Okay, this looks like the spot.
They're around here, but not too close.
Remember, don't get out of the truck.
I understand.
Major, there's one thing you haven't said.
Yeah?
You're actually making yourself the bait in a trap to catch one of the creatures.
Know a better way to go fishing?
No, I don't.
All right, stay with that Geiger counter.
In case I get company, signal with that horn, and fast.
One long, one short.
A deep hole had been dug.
And now it was being filled with the acrylic liquid.
The next step was to set a noose beneath the liquid... for once the acrylic hardened... the encased corpse would have enormous weight.
The plan now was to lure one of the walking dead into the area... where the pit had been dug.
A direct attack by Major Jay was the quickest... though the most dangerous, method of baiting the invader.
- They're coming, get ready.
- All right, Dad.
- You okay?
- I'm okay.
Get your father,
I want to get this into the chamber.
Major Jay!
They're all around us.
I saw them on the monitors.
They probably followed the truck.
They're trying to smash down the door.
Take it easy.
This place is built to stand an atom blast.
Come on, help me.
Are you sure the pressure will crack that stuff on the body?
It can crush anything not built to withstand it.
All right, when the acrylic coating on the body splits... we'll be turning an invader loose in the chamber... if we've caught one.
Let's find out. The pressure, Dr. Penner.
Nothing's happening.
Now we've got one of those things in here... and a mob of those dead men right outside.
If you hadn't gone out in the truck, they couldn't have followed us.
John, shut up.
Another point, Dr. Penner.
Look!
The thing is in there.
Yeah.
It looks like we caught ourselves an invader.
The rest is up to you, Dr. Penner.
Wait.
It's left the body.
Let's hope we can keep it locked up in that chamber.
Do not think you will succeed.
There is no way on your earth to make us visible.
Your people are being destroyed... country by country.
My unit has already received reports... that many of your nations are considering surrender.
You're lying.
You can check with your commanders for the truth.
If they had surrendered, you would have said so.
It is inevitable.
If you will surrender to me now... your lives will be spared.
Look, friend, you're the prisoner.
And as long as we have you to work over, we still have a chance.
Lamont, Dr. Penner, we'll continue on with the tests.
You will die, then, as all the rest of you shall die.
Dr. Penner and Dr. Lamont began immediate... experiments in a desperate effort... to make the invader visible to the human eye.
The vast scientific knowledge of the two men... was put to the test in a race against time.
For they knew that with every moment of failure... thousands more people all over Earth would die.
Time was running out for the defenders.
The world was nearing the end of its ability to fight back... for this was the third day.
By midnight, the human race on Earth would cease to exist.
They still trying to batter down the door?
No, they gave that up.
But they're still out there.
Probably trying to figure a new way to get at us.
That thing in the chamber knows we're trapped and that we can't get out alive.
If we surrendered, you think they'd let us live?
Maybe. We won't know if we don't try.
All our experiments have failed. Why wait?
We're not giving up.
Or do you two go along with him?
Major, we've tested everything.
Light rays, every shade on the spectrum... chemicals, mechanical devices, nothing.
We can't make it visible, we can't hurt it.
I asked you a question.
Do you agree with Lamont or don't you?
I don't know.
I'm too weary to think straight anymore.
Look. We can't hold out here forever.
Let's take their offer. See what happens.
Look, the three of you.
That thing in the chamber is bluffing.
The very fact that he's offering us our lives if we stop the tests... proves that we're on to something.
And he's afraid we're gonna find out.
You're a fool.
We're no closer now than we were an hour ago.
You do what you like. I'm taking the offer.
I'm letting that thing out of the chamber.
Make him stop.
John, I think we've hit on something.
- What, Dad?
- The creature.
You heard the alarm bell on the radiation counter.
The explosion and concussion made the creature react.
Nothing else has.
React?
We've been looking the wrong way for our answer.
It isn't in light waves or chemicals.
The answer is in sound!
- Sound, John!
- Sound to create sight?
You said the device used by that creature that came to your house... caused a humming sound.
Yes, the sound was low-key to our ears... but the device must've used sonic rays.
Sound vibrations that created resonance... with the basic molecular structure of the metal ore.
And that resonance caused visibility!
I just hope it isn't too late.
Sound is the answer.
He certainly reacted during the explosion.
Listen. When the chemicals in that flask hit the panel... it caused a short circuit... jumped the breakers and blew up our entire air-conditioning and filtering system.
Luckily, our radio's still intact.
- How long can the air last?
- An hour and a half.
Then we'll have to open the air vents.
We'll be sitting ducks for what's waiting for us outside.
Major, I want to apologize.
It's all right. Forget it.
Look, if you think sound is the answer, you better make sure, and fast.
There. That ought to do it.
Now, both these pieces of equipment are identical.
If one doesn't generate enough sound, we'll use both... and probably break our own eardrums.
- Nothing, nothing at all.
- Keep going.
Major, there's your weapon.
It not only makes the invaders visible, but destroys them as well.
Could the army turn these out in a hurry?
I could give headquarters all the details in a few minutes.
Good. Come on.
May Day Homer, this is Able Fox Niner Six, over.
Able Fox Niner Six...
There's a high-powered jamming signal in the area.
- You think the invaders are doing it?
- Deliberately, to kill our broadcasts.
The spaceship must be close by.
We could use the jamming signal to find the spaceship... by tracking it on the direction-finding radio in the truck.
Yeah. That'd be our only chance to get your information to Gen. Stone.
Yes. But what about the invaders waiting for us outside?
We're gonna crash right through.
If you have any prayers for a job like this... you better start saying them.
After you let us out, get to the transmitter.
When the jamming signal goes off, call the General in a hurry.
Good luck, Major.
Don't miss with the sound gun.
It's the only chance you have against radiation.
Okay, Dr. Penner, open her up.
The radio jamming set up by the invisible spaceship... was the only key to the location of the ship.
The directional-finding equipment on the truck operated by Dr. Lamont... had to use this key successfully... or all hope would be gone.
Slowly, but surely... the radio jamming led the truck to the immediate area... of the invisible ship used by the invaders.
Hold it.
May Day Homer. This is Able Fox Six.
Come in, please.
May Day Homer to Able Fox Niner Six.
Come in, Able Fox Niner Six.
Come in, please.
In the United Nations building in New York, a special meeting was called.
Present were Dr. Penner, his daughter...
Major Jay and Dr. Lamont... to receive grateful thanks from the countries of the world.
Earth had been on the brink of disaster.
But out of the holocaust of war... in which a dictatorship of the universe had been defeated... a lesson had been learned.
The nations of the world could work... and fight together, side by side... in a common cause.
- Sir?
Can you please tell me where
I can find Dolls Incorporated?
- Room 502, first door on your left.
- Thank you.
These are the Brownies from the Valley High School.
- The girls are here to visit the factory, Mr. Franz.
Yes, Mr. Franz.
He'll be with you in a moment.
I'm sure the girls would like to see the doll display while they're waiting.
- Well, fine.
Thank you.
- [Girl] I like the one over there next to you.
It's beautiful.
- [Girl] I like the one over there.
- [Girl] They've got so many beautiful dresses.
I like the one over there best.
There are so many, I don't know which one I want.
- Don't let Mr. Franz catch you.
He's very particular about these dolls.
Nobody's allowed to touch them.
Come on, let's look at the other dolls.
- Young lady, do you like my dolls?
- Oh, I think they're lovely.
- Do you really?
You must meet some of them.
My dolls are fashioned from all walks of life.
Here's a bride.
Isn't she lovely?
And over here, now let me see.
Here's a housewife going shopping.
And here, oh my, yes-
She's very important.
This is my nurse.
She helps to keep my little people well.
Wouldn't do for anything to happen to them, would it, nurse?
- You treat them like real people.
- But of course.
They're my friends.
My name is Franz.
What's yours, my dear?
- Sally Reynolds.
You came about my ad, I suppose.
- Yes. But I don't think
I'm the girl for the job.
- Wait, please.
Let me be the judge, huh?
How much experience have you had?
- Very little.
I worked a year in a college bookstore, that's all.
- Married?
- No.
- Live with your family?
- I haven't any family.
I'm on my own.
I'm sure there's somebody else that's better qualified.
- You're exactly the one
I want, Miss Reynolds.
I'd like you to start right away.
- I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
- Just answer the phone, take care of my accounts and my correspondence.
As you can see, I'm no good at paperwork.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Franz.
I couldn't.
- I have no one to help me with my dolls.
I work alone.
I need someone in the office.
Whatever you do, your work will be satisfactory, my dear.
I pay the usual wages, but if that isn't enough,
I could manage a little more.
Won't you please try it?
Just for a day or two?
- Dolls Incorporated.
One moment, please.
A Mr. Grant for you.
- I'll take it in the back room.
Yes, Mr. Grant.
- [Grant] I understand you had a secretary named Janet Hall?
- Yes, Miss Hall used to work for me.
- [Grant] Do you have any idea where I can reach her?
- Well, she left last week.
She was going to take a better position with Pathay.
You might try to reach her there.
- [Grant] This is Pathay.
She never showed up.
- If you see her, will you have her get in touch with me?
- I'd be glad to, Mr. Grant.
I'll make a note of it right away.
- [Grant] Thank you, goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Who is it?
- It's Sally.
Mr. Franz, if I'm to work for you,
I'll need the cash ledger.
Can you tell me where it is?
- I'm afraid I don't know.
Janet took such good care of things.
I'll be right out and help you look for it.
- Well, hello!
Who are you?
- My name is Sally.
I work for Mr. Franz.
- Since when?
- Six weeks ago.
Do you have business with Mr. Franz?
- I sure do.
I'm Bob Westley, the best salesman in St. Louis.
- Well, he can't be disturbed right now.
You may wait or perhaps come back later.
- [Bob] The least you can do is tell him I'm here.
- But I'm sorry, he just can't be disturbed.
- He's not in the factory.
Now, are you gonna tell me where he is?
- Please, don't get me into trouble.
Mr. Franz is in the back room.
And when he's in that room, he never wants to be disturbed.
- All right, all right, don't get excited.
But can't you send up some smoke signals or something?
Call him on the phone.
- He'd be furious.
- Mr. Franz, furious?
They don't come any milder than him.
Say, are you afraid of him?
- Please, I've got work to do.
If you'll excuse me,
I'll be able to do it.
- Look.
- Let's start all over again.
I apologize.
I don't want to get you into any trouble, and I want to be friends.
Okay?
- Okay.
- All right, now that we're friends, tell me the truth.
Are you afraid of your boss?
- No, I'm not afraid of him.
Maybe just a little.
He does get a little peculiar at times.
- What times?
- When he talks to them.
He's so serious.
It's almost as if he expected them to talk back.
- Who?
- Why, the dolls, of course.
- The dolls? (laughs)
- Wait, just a minute.
- Good morning, Sally.
Been dreaming up anything new about the boss?
- Dolls Incorporated?
- It's on the fifth floor.
- Second floor!
- Well, I can take the letter.
I work there.
- Are you Miss Hall?
- No.
- Well, it's registered.
Someone will have to sign for it.
- Maybe you better see Mr. Franz about it.
- Third floor!
- Are you another new man?
Seems we just got one lately.
- I'm special delivery.
- Fourth floor!
- Whatever happened to that friendly fellow who brought the mail around here for so long?
- You mean Old Ernie?
Funny thing, two days before he was to retire and get a pension, he disappeared.
Yes sir, started out one morning with his mail sack and never came back.
- Yes, Miss Reynolds.
I'll be right out and sign for it.
Bob.
Good morning.
- Morning.
- I'm sorry I don't know
Miss Hall's new address, but I expect her to stop by in a day or two.
I'll see she gets this.
- [Delivery Man] Thank you.
Come on in, Bob.
- Sorry if I hurt your feelings.
- I'll be right with you, Bob.
- [Sally] How beautiful!
- Yes, very nice.
The price doesn't seem too out of line.
I'll take four gross of that.
What do you like, my dear?
- This one here.
- The white organdy with the blue ribbons.
- Ah, It's a pity you can't model it for us.
I can see it would be very becoming on you.
Yes.
- Well, two gross of the strapless organdy, and two of the negligee.
- How about lingerie to go with it?
- Yes, you can put that in, too.
When can you deliver them?
- [Salesman] Ten days.
Is that all right?
- Yes.
- Will that be all, Mr. Franz?
- Do you mind if I keep this strapless organdy?
You can charge it to my order.
- I think that'll be all right.
Thank you, Mr. Franz.
Thank you, Miss.
- Here, let me get rid of some of this stuff for you.
- Miss Reynolds, I don't know what I'd ever do without you.
- Yes, Miss Reynolds.
Who?
No!
By all means, tell him
I'll be right there.
An old friend out of the past is here to see me.
Shall we call it a day?
I'd have to stop soon anyway to mix more plastic.
So, you'll forgive me, won't you?
- Certainly, sir.
- Hey!
- My dear friend, how are you?
- [Franz] Emil, what a surprise.
I didn't even know you were in this part of the world.
- I arrived yesterday.
- With your puppets?
- Why of course, of course.
My puppets open their show next Monday.
And listen, Franz, I should like you very much to come to the theater and meet them.
- Of course, I should be happy to.
- Good.
- How did you ever find me?
- Well, I thought I'd need the services of a marionette-maker while I was here.
So, I opened the directory and there was your name.
It's been a long time, Franz.
No more show business, huh?
- No, no, I gave that up.
I just have dolls now.
- Dolls, eh?
- Many, many dolls, as you can see.
- As long as you enjoy it.
- Tell me, how's your dear Emma?
- Emma, Emma.
- Emma, the girl with the beautiful golden hair, your wife.
- I have tried so long to forget that name,
I sometimes almost succeed.
She left me.
- When did this happen?
My marionettes were playing in Luxembourg.
And she ran away with someone she liked better.
An acrobat.
- Acro, oh, how that must've hurt.
How that must've hurt, Franz.
- But I'm happy now at any rate, and that's what counts.
Emil, let me take you to dinner.
- [Emil] Why not, why not?
- And we'll have time to stop at the theater and visit your marionettes.
- That's an excellent idea, Franz.
- So, let us go.
- And wait till you meet my little puppets.
- (applauding) Bravo, bravo, bravo!
Excellent, Franz, excellent.
You know, I haven't seen a performance like that in ages.
Well, well, well.
This is like the good old days again, huh, Franz?
You were once the best in our profession.
You still could be, if you wanted to.
Well, you see, things have been getting too much for me lately and I've been thinking of a partner.
What about joining me, huh?
- It doesn't interest me.
- Why not?
Because my marionettes are getting old and need attention?
- Oh, I don't mind repairing them, it isn't that.
- What is it, then?
- I'm content in my doll factory.
Isn't it time we ate?
- Do you know what's wrong with you, my friend?
- Why must someone who's content with things the way they are always have something wrong with him?
- Contentment is unnatural.
Emma's leaving must've done you a great deal of harm, my boy.
- You think so?
You've run away from life.
You've surrounded yourself with all shapes of people, with their faces, their legs, their arms.
Even little mannequins of them.
But not their spirit.
You're afraid of that.
- Well, I've found peace, anyhow.
- Will it last?
- I have no fear it won't.
I love my dolls and I'm quite sure they'll never leave me.
Let's forget about the past, Emil, and have a good time, huh?
Living in the present is the only important thing.
And then after dinner, we'll go back to my shop, huh?
- Excellent idea.
- How about that?
- Happy?
- Mmhm.
Did you pick this show for any particular reason?
- I get tired of the same things all the time.
Don't you?
- Yes, I do.
Such as what?
- Dolls.
- Why don't you ask me what it feels like to be a freak?
- Please sir, I--
- This is how it feels to be so big you can stick your fist through a circus top!
Like a clown!
- Mr. Franz said you were going back to St. Louis tomorrow.
- Maybe.
- [Colossal Man] It's ingestible,
I can grow to be 100 feet tall!
And I don't need a change of wardrobe.
- How would you like to come with me?
- What would I do in St. Louis?
- Live in a pretty little house.
Become Mrs. Bob Westley.
- Man lives through plutonium blast.
That's a great joke, isn't it, sergeant? (laughs)
- Why do you think I've been hanging around all these weeks?
What do you say?
- I don't know what to say.
- Don't say anything.
- Do you want to go back to your quarters and tell your friends about the monster, about the circus freak?
That's right, sergeant.
I'm a circus freak.
Have a tent, will travel.
Why don't you make a sign saying: see the amazing colossal man?
- Say, I got a terrific idea.
What do you say we fly to Las Vegas tomorrow and get married?
- I couldn't leave without telling Mr. Franz I'm going.
- Well, let me tell him.
I'll see him first thing in the morning.
You get packed and be ready and I'll pick you up at 10:00.
How's that?
- Wonderful.
- [Colossal Man] I'm not growing, you're shrinking!
- Hello?
- Miss Reynolds.
Is anything the matter?
When you didn't come to the office this morning,
I began to worry.
- Well, hasn't Mr.
Westley been to see you?
- Yes, he was here earlier, but he's left.
- [Sally] Where did he go?
- Back to St. Louis, I believe.
Miss Reynolds, Miss Reynolds?
Are you all right?
- Yes.
- Can I expect you at the office this morning?
- Yes. I'll be there.
- All right.
Ah, there you are.
Now things are as they should be.
By the way, I left the bill for those St. Louis shipments on your desk.
- I'll see to them right away.
Mr. Franz, did Bob go by air?
- No, by train.
I believe he had his ticket all ready.
- It was very sudden.
- Well, he'd been neglecting his business lately.
It probably caught up with him.
- Didn't he tell you anything about me?
- Yes, of course, he did.
He told me that he'd asked you to marry him, and that you had consented.
When's it to be?
- He didn't...
I mean, we haven't set the date.
- Bob gave me to understand that you wouldn't have worked for me after you were married.
I begged him not to take you away.
I told him how sad it is when people go.
Oh, my dear.
I didn't mean to make you unhappy.
Is it because he didn't come and say goodbye?
That wasn't very thoughtful of him.
Will you listen to an old friend?
Perhaps it would be better if you tried to forget him.
- I don't know what to think.
That's not true, I do know.
Bob wouldn't treat me this way if he could help it.
Something's happened to him.
- When did you make this, Mr. Franz?
While Bob was here.
- It could be him, almost.
- Well, thank you for the compliment.
The aim of every composer is to fit the world within the limits of his symphony.
A writer wants to put all of life between the covers of his book.
If I can make my dolls in the image of those I know and love,
I'm satisfied.
Oh, it's a small talent, I know, but I have to make the most of it.
It's the only one I have.
I'll be out of the office for an hour or so, Miss Reynolds.
Will you lock up, my dear?
I have my own key.
- Pardon me.
Can you tell me where
Sergeant Paterson is?
Thank you.
Sergeant Paterson?
- Yes.
- I'm Sally Reynolds.
The man at the desk sent me to you.
- Oh, yes.
Sit down, Miss Reynolds.
Here it is.
You say in this report you made downstairs that your fiancé disappeared mysteriously.
Just what does that mean?
- Something Mr. Franz did to him.
- Such as?
- Well, Mr. Franz did something to him.
- You said that.
- Well, I don't know how else to put it.
- Did he hit him?
Did he shoot him?
Did he strangle him?
- No, he...
You won't believe me.
- Well, that's my business.
Now tell me, just what did he do?
- He made Bob into a doll.
- He made your fiancé into a doll.
I see.
Well, we'll let you know if we learn anything, Miss Reynolds.
I knew you wouldn't believe me.
Suppose there were some other people that disappeared the same way?
Would you do something then?
- That all depends.
Who were they?
- Janet Hall.
- Anyone else?
- A mailman named Ernie.
- Ernie Larson.
Go on.
- Well, isn't that enough?
I guess it is.
- Okay, let's go and see this Mr. Franz.
- He's taken Bob down.
He must have him inside.
- Is this the man?
- Yes.
- The lady says you've been making people disappear mysteriously, turning them into dolls.
- Why, Miss Reynolds, what made you say such a thing?
That's perfectly ridiculous.
- Is that Westley?
How come it looks just like her boyfriend?
- I model all my dolls after people I know and like.
People I like to have near me.
There's nothing wrong with that, is there?
- May I see it, please?
- Certainly.
- It's lifelike, all right.
- Well, I should hope so.
But I assure you, it's only a doll.
Watch.
What did you expect, my dear?
They're only made of plastic.
You see, here's a whole case full of them.
- Well, looks like your boyfriend kind of took a powder, doesn't it?
Okay, I'll put through a tracer on him, anyway.
Be seeing you.
- Feel free to drop in anytime, Sergeant.
- Thank you.
- Oh, you weren't thinking of going too, were you, dear?
- Of course.
- Please, don't.
It would make me so unhappy.
- Do you really expect me to work for you after all this?
- I think of your pretty eyes and your lovely voice, and the beautiful flowers on your desk, and I ask myself, how could I ever bear to let you go?
- But it's impossible.
- Now why do you say that, my dear?
- Because I can't stand being in this place another minute.
It's locked!
Open the door, it's locked!
No, no!
- Be careful, my dear.
You aren't afraid of me, are you?
Why, I'm your friend.
You mustn't feel bad, Miss Reynolds.
It's time for you to put on your new clothes.
You don't want to meet your fiancé dressed in nothing but a napkin, do you?
Here they are.
First your toilet articles.
And your stockings.
And the dress.
Oh, it's very pretty.
You remember you selected this yourself?
You want to make yourself look nice, I'm sure.
You're going to meet Bob.
Shall I help you?
That's better.
He's only asleep, Miss Reynolds.
What you might call a state of suspended animation.
- Bob, Bob!
- Oh, be patient, he'll be with you in a minute.
This fresh air will revive him in no time.
You don't know how much I enjoy these little reunions.
You funny little people.
I wonder why it is you always hate me so at first.
I haven't really harmed you.
You get the best of care.
I never let you get too warm or cold, too hungry or too tired.
You should be grateful.
Think.
No daily grind, no budget problems, no taxes or debts or family to support.
I see to everything.
And it's never dull.
You sleep away the long boring hours in your jars, and when I take you out to wake you, it's only to have fun.
To enjoy some new treat
I've thought up for you.
Don't you see how fortunate you are?
You have nothing to do all the rest of your little lives but be happy.
- That's what you think!
Change us back the way we were!
- I like you better the way you are.
- Are you going to keep us this size?
- Always.
- What have you done to us?
- Would you really like to know?
It's my secret, but I don't think you'll give me away.
It's a very simple principle, really.
Notice how this slide projector throws a visual image.
I can make it any size I choose.
When I push it closer to the wall, the picture becomes smaller.
Being of an inquiring mind,
I asked myself one day if I couldn't do the same with living things.
I reasoned that if I could pass them through a device similar in principle to this slide projector then I would be able to project these living things to any size that I would choose.
This is the answer I found.
Here, Tommy.
Tommy, Tommy, Tommy!
To project a complex molecular structure, such as a man or say a cat, it's only necessary to change them into energy first.
Much as the light in that slide projector.
I soon found out that the most practical way of causing this change was to break down the molecular structure by means of high-frequency vibration.
Now, with this tuning fork, I will set up a sonic vibration.
Just as the glass disintegrated through the resonant frequency sent out by this tuning fork, so will a living thing disintegrate to its resonant frequency.
Of course, it's a much higher frequency.
Oh, there you are, Tommy.
Now, watch this.
All right, kitty, I have something for you.
Now, watch the cat.
You remember Tommy, Miss Reynolds.
He always liked you.
Take him.
Being so small, he may feel strange at first.
Pet him.
I must get some of the other little people who live with me.
I want them to meet you.
- Hello, big boy.
Who's your friend?
- [Franz] Miss Reynolds, may I introduce Miss Lane?
- Call me Georgia.
They all do.
Glad to meet you, Sally.
Welcome to the toy department.
- [Laurie] Hi, kids!
- This is Laurie.
She's a swell kid.
Laurie, meet Bob and Sally.
- How are you?
- Hello.
- Gosh, I'm awfully sleepy.
How long did he put me away this time?
- For a couple of months, anyhow.
Say, you missed a lot of fun, we had a picnic in a flower box, two dances, and a moonlight swimming party in the sink.
And all because I wouldn't sing for him.
- Hi, Laurie, long time no see.
Hi, everybody.
- Well hi Stan.
Say hello to Bob and Sally.
And if it isn't Mac, pride of the Marine Corps.
Mac, meet Bob and Sally.
- Well, welcome, stranger.
Hey, the old Franz is learning how to pick 'em better all the time.
- Hey, when are we gonna get this party rolling?
- Yeah, let's go!
What are we waiting for, big boy?
We got a new arrival here to celebrate!
- I have some refreshments for our little party.
A petit four.
A knife to cut it with.
Some tiny little cups and saucers.
And a miniature bottle of champagne.
Please help yourselves.
I'm afraid I'm a little too clumsy to serve my guests when they're as small as you.
- [Georgia] Oh, boy.
This is great!
- A toast to the new members of the family, Sally and Bob.
- Are you two engaged?
Say, when's the wedding going to be?
- You'd better ask him.
- Poor Bob and Sally.
There's no one your size who can marry you.
I'll have to see what I can do about it, sometime.
- Stop! All of you stop!
How can you be so calm?
Call for help, run, do something, anything but this!
- Say, what's the matter with her, anyway?
I got used to this size in about 10 minutes.
And believe me, brother,
I kind of like it.
I ain't never had it so easy in my life.
- Look at it this way, Sally.
We're in a jam, and there's nothing to do but make the best of it, for the time being anyway.
- I know how she feels.
I took it pretty hard, too.
But we sometimes have to do things we don't want to just to have some freedom like this.
- Listen, he drops a capsule in your jars to put you to sleep.
Don't breathe any of it--
- Pipe down, everybody, he's coming back.
- Come on, baby, let's go.
- [Mac] Rock it, rock it!
- Now, Laurie, you must sing for us.
- No, I don't want to sing.
- [Franz] But you will, my dear, or back in the bottle you go.
♫ You're a dolly
♫ You're so cute and lovely, dearest little doll
♫ Say you want me to be near you
♫ To be yours forever more, my little doll
♫ You're so precious, you're so darling
♫ You're all that I could want, a living doll
♫ Never leave me, don't deceive me
♫ Stay with me forever more, my living doll
♫ Never leave me
♫ Don't deceive me
♫ Stay with me forever more, my living doll
- Yes?
- I was passing by and saw the light in your window.
I thought you might be lonesome, so I dropped in.
You mind?
- That was kind of you, Emil.
Tell me, how did your opening night go?
- Franz, wonderful, wonderful.
Come and sit down and I'll tell you all about it.
- Let me put things away, huh?
- Ah, but it will only take one minute.
- You must hear what happened last night.
Come, sit down, will you?
First of all, everybody was there.
But everybody!
- He's got somebody outside.
- The telephone.
The police.
Does anybody know their number?
- I should remember.
I called them just yesterday.
- Come on, come on, hurry up!
- Police department.
Police department!
- We're at Dolls Incorporated!
Fifth floor of the Tilford building!
Please hurry!
- Police department!
Anybody on this line?
- Oh, he can't hear me.
It's the music.
- But if we stop it, Franz is sure to come back.
- Tilford building!
Fifth floor!
Dolls Incorporated!
- [Switchboard Operator]
Anybody on this line?
- [All] Help! Help!
Help! Help!
- Oh, what's the use?
Nobody can hear little people like us.
- It's awful when you think there are people all around us, and we can't even get through to them.
- And then, right after the first act, who do you suppose--
- Emil, I simply have to go now.
- Now wait a minute, Franz, wait.
You don't know who came backstage to congratulate me.
- Just a minute.
I have to take care of the record player.
- There, you see.
The record player takes care of itself.
Now come on, let me finish it.
- Franz, listen.
I tell you, it was like the good old days in Brussels.
Now, will you guess the name of the party who came backstage?
Come on, try, try.
- I can't guess.
You tell me.
- The machine.
I was wondering if we could go through it the other way and come out our right size again.
He said it works like a projector.
I'll bet I could figure out the controls.
- It may not be a good idea to fool with it.
You might get killed.
- I don't care.
I'm willing to risk it.
- I am, too.
Who wouldn't be?
- Well, one's enough.
It only takes one of us to go for help.
Shall we try it?
- [All] Yeah.
- No no no, hold it, you living dolls, but I was one of his first puppets.
So I deserve the right to be the guinea pig, okay?
- All right, Mac.
If that's the way you want it.
You know what can happen if I make a mistake.
- Come on, let's go.
- Well if it does work, you're going to need some clothes, now I'm pretty sure he keeps our old ones in that closet.
- That's right.
I saw him hang mine up over there.
- Well, come on, let's go.
You three girls better stay up here.
I'll work the controls.
Stan, you go to the door and keep an eye out for Franz.
- Just a minute.
- There you go.
Okay, Mac.
Come on, let's go!
- How splendid for you.
- So, I said to myself, I said, at last I'm being appreciated.
I could have wept for happiness, Franz.
- And I am happy for you.
May I go now?
- Well, I shouldn't detain you like this, should I?
You go on and--
- You see, I have to be alone in this kind of work, I'm doing.
You understand?
- [Stan] Hold it!
- Why don't you go and do what you have to do, and I'll talk to you while you work?
- No, no.
I'd rather give you my undivided attention, old friend.
So tell me, what happened then?
- Okay.
- We'd better get back.
- What about a nightcap with me, huh?
- Oh, I only wish I could.
- Oh, lunch tomorrow then, huh?
- Certainly.
I'll call for you about noon.
- Excellent, excellent.
- Well, I suppose there's nothing more for us to say but goodnight, huh?
- Let's be bold and get it over with.
Goodnight.
- [Emil] Goodnight.
- [Mac] Come on, Stan.
- You've had enough fun for tonight.
Come to bed quickly now.
It's time.
Come in.
- Ah, Sergeant, how are you?
- Fine, Mr. Franz.
- You don't mind if I go on with my work, do you?
I'm shorthanded and
I've fallen way behind.
- I notice you're advertising for another secretary.
- Yes, it's quite a problem keeping help these days.
- How'd you happen to lose Sally Reynolds?
- She went to St. Louis, I believe.
Her fiancé lives there, you know.
- Well, I could have saved her the trip.
- Why have you news of him?
- Well, he didn't show up at home, and we've been asked to do more some more checking on him here.
- How strange.
What do you suppose could have become of him?
- Well, that's what I came to ask you.
- Mister, can you fix my dolly?
- Will you excuse me?
- Go ahead, take care of your customer.
I'll just look around.
- Well, let's see what we can do for you.
Tell me, what's your dolly's name?
- Susie.
She got run over.
- Oh, dear, dear, dear.
How did that happen?
- She ran out in the street while I wasn't looking.
- (clicks tongue) That wasn't nice of her, was it?
- She's a bad dolly.
- You know, you ought to spank her when she disobeys.
- I do, but it doesn't seem to do any good.
Are your dollies like that?
- They do get rather headstrong sometimes.
- Mr. Franz?
What's in here?
- [Franz] Oh, just a workroom.
- Well, may see it, please?
- There's nothing there that would interest you, Sergeant.
I go there whenever I'm lonely.
- I would like to see it.
May I have the key, please?
Thank you.
- You have so many dollies.
They must give you a lot of trouble.
- Yes, but they're nice.
I never get lonely and that makes up for it.
- Oh look!
Isn't that cute?
Can I have it?
No, dear, no, no.
- Please, why not?
- Well, everybody would want to know where you got it.
You know, grownups ask so many awkward questions.
Now you better give it to me.
- Don't take it away from me, I want it.
- What do you call this thing in here?
- You can play with it until I get back.
- Oh, that?
Well, what's it look like to you?
- You've got me.
- You know what a photographic enlarger is, don't you?
- Well, this works just the opposite.
I use it to make models of people.
Wouldn't you like to see how it works?
- Some other time.
I've got to be running along.
We'll, what you got there, little girl?
Let's see.
A tape recording inside.
You like it?
- [Girl] Uh-huh.
Can I have it?
- No. But you can come and play with it anytime you like.
- And the cat?
- Yes. That, too.
- About those missing people,
I'll be checking with you later.
- I do hope you find them soon, Sergeant.
- Thank you.
Bye, honey.
- [Girl] Bye,
- Now, to fix your dolly.
(chuckles) This is one of the best puppets you ever had, Emil.
- It's one of the best Jekyll and Hydes there ever was.
It was made by Schwartz, back in the good old days in Prague.
But a funny thing, every time the cue comes for Jekyll to change into Hyde, nothing happens.
- Did you bring me back here at this late hour because your star puppet was a little temperamental?
- Please, Franz.
Please understand my predicament.
- There are only three people in the world
I trust to cure him.
Mariani, who's in Milan.
Auriac, but he's in Paris, and you.
- You know perfectly well I never could resist flattery.
- How much time can I have to work on him?
- Well, you see, we have a matinee tomorrow at 2:00.
It would be tragic to return all that money for the tickets.
Can you have him ready that soon?
- I'll try it, even if it takes me all night.
- Good, and, one more thing, how much is this gonna cost?
- Oh nothing.
That's the least I can do for an old friend.
- Thank you, thank you.
- May a dear old friend ask you something of a personal nature?
- Certainly.
- What are you up to that brings the police over to ask me all sorts of questions?
- When was this?
- This afternoon.
A police sergeant named Paterson.
He comes to my hotel room, and it sounds fantastic,
He asked me if you were in the habit of making people disappear.
- I suppose you told him
I do it all the time?
- Ah but seriously, it's bad business to have police prying into your affairs.
- Emil, I'm quite serious.
If I thought I was being watched
I would find life intolerable.
Now, be a good fellow, will you, and tell the night doorman to let me in the theater later on.
I'll have to give Mr. Hyde a tryout when he's finished.
- I'll run along now.
I'll do it on my way home.
I don't suppose I have to tell you how grateful I am to you, Franz.
- Oh, nonsense!
Good night, Emil.
And goodbye.
Oh.
Sorry you're awake, Miss Reynolds.
Makes everything much more difficult.
- What are you going to do?
- The police have been asking my friend, Emil, questions.
They're getting uncomfortably close.
That leaves me only one course.
- You'll free us, won't you?
You'll make us our right size again?
- And be deprived of your company?
Oh no, I couldn't let that happen.
Can't you see?
It's better that we all bow out together.
Oh please, don't be frightened.
Can't you see?
It's much better that we all meet death together than for any one of us to be left alone.
There's nothing worse than loneliness.
Wait, wait, I have a splendid idea.
Yes, we'll have a going-away party for all of us.
A celebration.
My friend Emil asked me to fix his puppet and leave it at the theater.
We'll have our party there, a theater party.
Now, let's all get ready.
- Say, what's the matter with being a bottle baby?
Look at the service we get.
Oh, the old boy is really letting go.
He's been giving us parties like they're going out of style.
And tonight, a theater party no less.
- You better enjoy it,
Georgia, as it may be our last.
- What are you talking about?
- Sally!
Tell her.
- He said that tonight.
He said tonight he was to kill us all, himself too.
- You'd better hurry up and dress.
We'll tell the boys.
- Bob, Bob, he said he's going to--
- Yeah, I know.
We heard you tell Georgia.
- Oh, if I was just my old size for five minutes.
- Hey, let's try the telephone again.
There's no music now.
Maybe they'll hear us.
- Yeah sure.
So would Franz.
He's just outside the door.
Hey, the window.
It's slightly open.
Maybe we could signal somebody.
- Sure we can.
We're only five stories up.
- Hey, here's some paper.
Somebody get something to write with.
Laurie, keep an eye out for Franz.
- Here's an old paintbrush.
It's all dried up.
- Say, how about using some of this lipstick?
- [Stan] Hey, here's a pencil.
- [Bob] Hey, that's great.
Bring it on over.
Let's see now.
I'll write, help, send police!
- Come on, hurry up.
Aim it good.
- Now, shall we take a taxi to the theater?
I think that'd be a nice treat.
Of course, you won't be able to see out the window, but I don't think you'll mind that little inconvenience.
At least, you'll be able to hear what the city sounds like at night because this time, I shan't put you to sleep.
You've been very good.
This is your reward.
- You all right, Mr. Franz?
- Yes, yes, fine.
- [Doorman] Kind of lonesome in a theater with nobody around.
- Not to me.
I have my puppets to keep me company.
- But you've been at it all night.
I thought maybe I'd get you some more coffee.
- No, no more coffee.
I still have plenty.
Don't come on the stage!
- All right, all right.
No more coffee.
- I've got one of those capsules he uses to put us to sleep.
We could slip it in his coffee.
It may not put him to sleep, but it'd probably slow him down some.
- Where'd you get it?
- The last time he put us away.
- Now then, I think our puppet friend Dr. Jekyll is ready for a trial.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,
I am Dr. Jekyll.
I have discovered a strange drug that is able to free my evil nature from what is good in me.
Then I become the sinister monster, Mr. Hyde.
With the assistance of a few members of our audience,
I'd like to put on one of the scenes from our little play.
Which one of you will volunteer?
Come now, we mustn't keep Dr. Jekyll waiting.
Miss Reynolds, you will play the good doctor's fiancé.
Georgia, you will be his victim.
And, now let me see, for
Dr. Jekyll's best friend...
Yes Bob, you should be very good in the part.
The rest of you just sit back and enjoy yourselves.
All right, you're on now, Miss Reynolds.
I'll prompt you on what to do.
- Go ahead, darling.
Keep his eyes off the coffee cup.
- Tell him he's been strange lately and ask him what's the matter.
- You've been strange lately.
Tell me what's the matter.
- Nothing, my dear.
Nothing at all.
It's only your imagination.
You must play up to him, Miss Reynolds.
Remember, you love him.
Say so.
Tell him he can trust you.
- You know I love you.
Why can't you be kind to me?
- No. More convincing, dear.
Try it again.
- You know I love you.
Why can't you be kind to me?
- That's it, my dear, that's it.
Things are different now.
They can never be changed back again.
Perhaps it would be best if we stopped seeing one another.
There is danger here for you and I wouldn't want anything to happen to you.
Ask him to confide in you.
- Why won't you tell me what's wrong?
- [Franz] I have traveled the road of no return.
There is no going back.
Only death can free me from the curse
I have put upon myself.
- Why you're more of a fiend than I thought!
If you're gonna kill us, get it over with!
Cut out this cat-and-mouse game!
- Bob, don't ruin our last act.
- Look at this puppet down here, Franz.
Look at it closely!
It's a monster all right, but not half the monster you are!
- Oh, stop it, Bob!
The puppet!
You're destroying the puppet!
Stop it, I tell you!
Stop it!
Who's there?
Me again.
Don't come on the stage!
I thought I told you I don't want to be disturbed.
- Well, I heard you shouting and I thought--
- You thought what?
- Maybe you want some more coffee.
- No, no, your coffee's fine and still have plenty.
- Bob!
Miss Reynolds!
Where have you run to?
Where are you hiding?
Where are you?
Don't run away from me!
Come, it's time for us to go!
- Who are you talking to, anyway?
- Haven't you heard a ventriloquist practice throwing his voice?
- Help! We're here!
- Come over here, help!
- [Doorman] Oh, I've heard about enough.
- There must be somebody nearby!
- It's 5:30 in the morning.
Most people are in bed now.
- Oh, it's hopeless!
- Let's try to get back to
Franz's place and the machine.
If we make it, we can come back for the others.
- It's this way.
- Second and main.
And we have to go to Seventh and Hill.
- How far is it?
About a mile, I think.
- When we're our size, that's the equivalent of six miles.
- How can we ever make it, Bob?
- We're not gonna make it standing here.
Come on.
- Who are you looking for?
- [Franz] Did you see them leave?
- Them? Who?
- Never mind.
- Are you sure it's this way?
- I think so.
I was almost sure that it was.
- Wait, Bob, look, it's the factory.
Come on, let's hurry.
- No wait, we have to go to the fifth floor.
The elevator operator won't be on for at least an hour.
We can't operate it ourselves.
Hey, what about freight?
- What do you mean?
- Well, there must be a freight elevator around back.
When do they make deliveries?
- I don't know.
Shipments usually come in before I get to work.
- Come on.
Hey, Wait!
Oh, it's all right.
He'll be back for another load in a minute.
- Bob, look!
Bob, look, the label!
It's for Mr. Franz.
- Go on, get out!
Get out of here!
- Hey, we're in luck.
He left the doors open.
- Mr. Franz!
Mr. Franz!
- What's the matter, honey?
Isn't Mr. Franz in?
Let me try.
- Well, it looks like we both missed him, doesn't it?
You like him, don't you?
Because he makes dollies?
- [Girl] And people, too.
- People?
- Little people.
- He makes little people, does he?
How?
- Out of big ones with a machine.
- Real little people?
People that walk and talk and everything?
How do you know?
- Mr. Franz showed me.
He said, sometimes when I'm good
I can play with them.
- [Paterso] So he isn't here to let you play with them, and that's why you're unhappy, huh?
- [Girl] He said I could play with his kitty.
- [Paterson] Oh, a kitty?
- [Girl] A little, tiny kitty.
Mr. Franz keeps it in a matchbox.
He made it in his machine.
- I see.
Isn't it time you were going to school?
Well, come on.
I'm going to take you there.
Little people.
Cat in a matchbox, huh?
Come on.
- Get away from that door.
Come on, Sally.
We'll call the police.
- Don't leave me.
Please don't leave me.
Don't leave me!
I'll be alone.

{3338}{3486}KYUSHU - MOUNT ASO
{4191}{4214}Hey!
{4260}{4291}Good Morning.
{4301}{4434}Hey, were you out last night again?|-Yes, I'm sorry.
{4442}{4465}That's not good!
{5220}{5341}Get back! Back off! What is this?|Stop getting so excited!
{5641}{5681}Stop! Stop!
{5689}{5759}How many times have I told you|to stop this foolishness?
{5767}{5851}I won't put up with this|anymore! Alright, Yoshi?
{5904}{5939}You too, Goro.
{6092}{6206}Well everyone, let's go, let's go!|Save your strength for the mines!
{6391}{6437}Good morning.|-Good morning.
{6775}{6803}Descending!
{7840}{7866}Hello!
{7875}{7915}Good morning.
{7981}{8062}It's very warm out today.
{8071}{8133}Haven't you figured out|what's wrong with the Earth?
{8140}{8191}What's happening to the Earth?
{8219}{8365}With eight million tons being mined out of this|entire area, I'd say the Earth is running out of ore.
{8374}{8402}Oh, no!
{8585}{8629}Hello, main office.
{8694}{8736}Filled with water?!
{8771}{8823}Mine number eight?
{8887}{8939}Alright, I'll be there soon.
{8982}{9065}Two meters of water has|flooded the mine.
{9086}{9215}That's strange. There wasn't any|there the last time it was surveyed.
{9245}{9298}It must be an underground spring.
{9305}{9336}I'll go check it out.
{9390}{9448}Hey, give me a hand here!|-Yes, sir!
{9791}{9840}It's shut down! It's shut down!
{9959}{9994}Go ahead!|-Go ahead!
{10314}{10344}Thank you for coming!
{10470}{10499}How did it happen?
{10507}{10585}We were mining a wall,|when it started flooding.
{10593}{10616}How bad is it?
{10624}{10731}It's flooded pretty bad...|We had no way to control it.
{10741}{10776}Well I'm glad that everyone's safe.
{10802}{10865}No... Yoshi and Goro are still down there.
{10890}{11018}I need to down and look at it.|I need some volunteers.
{11025}{11065}Is it okay?|-It's okay.
{11109}{11179}Suikishi, Saba... Let's go!
{11244}{11300}Be careful.|-Be careful.
{12751}{12797}That's Yoshi!
{12810}{12849}Hurry! Hurry!
{13020}{13081}Yoshi!|-Yoshi!
{13088}{13130}Hurry! Hurry!
{14272}{14305}Doctor...
{14357}{14432}It's hard to say.|It's not a simple wound.
{14465}{14539}I've never seen a|head wound like that.
{14549}{14666}But... What could have|done something like that?
{14747}{14806}You've contacted the police, right?
{14813}{14905}Yes. They should be here around 1 PM.
{15083}{15230}Yoshi's my husband! Let me see him! Please|let me see him! Please let me see him!
{15234}{15277}Please let me see him!|Please let me see him!
{15279}{15381}Wait! Wait! You'll have to|wait for the doctors see him.
{15741}{15770}Let's go.
{15873}{15921}Haven't they found Goro yet?
{15931}{16038}Hey! There's no proof|he's the criminal, right?
{16046}{16136}I'm prepared to believe it.|That's my opinion of it.
{16146}{16225}That's for the police to decide.|It's best to keep it to yourself.
{16234}{16370}But, he and Goro were working together.|Why haven't they found Goro's body?
{16381}{16461}Please don't go spreading this around.
{16998}{17045}Oh, they're taking a look at him now.
{17125}{17156}Kio...
{17365}{17417}Is it true about my brother?...
{17506}{17564}It's impossible.
{17572}{17613}But, everyone...
{17686}{17735}Believe in your brother.
{17759}{17921}Until they can get a hold of Goro,|they can't be sure if he's the criminal.
{17934}{17973}I'm sure of it.
{18262}{18400}I can walk with you to the mines.
{18409}{18453}Come on, let's go.
{18857}{18895}Oto!|-Here!
{18902}{18936}Oetsuka!|-Here!
{18945}{18980}Ooyama!|-Here!
{18986}{19019}Mamura!|-Here!
{19027}{19052}Hodo!|-Here!
{19066}{19092}Akeshita!|-Here!
{19100}{19132}Mamona!|-Here!
{19146}{19183}Akira!|-Here!
{19190}{19242}Here!|-Here!
{19752}{19855}We've completed a full roll call|and Goro is the only one missing.
{19931}{20019}You're sure that Goro|hasn't come out yet?
{20027}{20091}This is the only|way out of the mine.
{20163}{20192}You hear that?
{20235}{20270}You're too jumpy!
{20303}{20343}Someone must have gone in again.
{20352}{20470}No! The only person|in there would be... Goro.
{20554}{20625}Alright. I'm going in.
{20728}{20767}Give me the rope.
{20808}{20871}There must be something wrong with him.
{21754}{21802}What's that noise?
{21832}{21917}Goro? Goro!
{22161}{22190}It's him!
{22233}{22267}Idiot! Control yourself!
{22307}{22349}It may be nothing...
{22559}{22638}Goro?|-Goro!
{22891}{22920}It's him!
{22928}{23070}Idiot! There's nothing to|be afraid of! Keep quiet!
{25123}{25235}Hey, just a moment. Here they come!|-Hold on please.
{25838}{25889}These aren't ordinary murders.
{25904}{26033}How could a criminal make wounds|like this on these men?
{26153}{26316}The wounds could only have been|made by someone of great strength.
{26323}{26425}In Japan and in the rest of the world,|I've never seen a weapon so sharp.
{26432}{26471}What is the weapon?
{26546}{26601}I regret that I can't even guess.
{26608}{26681}Incredible... Murders unlike any in Japan.
{26688}{26753}Of course, we'll have to do something.
{26760}{26826}I'll increase the number|of police in the village.
{26946}{27014}Let me go! Let me go! Let me go!
{27021}{27063}Hurry! Get the others!
{27133}{27189}Otama! Otama!
{27203}{27262}Otama! Otama!
{27349}{27423}Kio! Kio!
{27497}{27564}Let me go! Let me go!
{27581}{27613}Stop!
{27617}{27786}She's right. You cannot|blame her for your pain, ok?!
{27837}{27871}Thank you...
{28711}{28748}Shigeru!
{29506}{29654}Kio... I don't believe|Goro is the murderer.
{29741}{29912}To kill... Goro would have|to be pushed too far.
{29964}{30074}I don't think he killed|anyone. I'm sure of it.
{30159}{30248}I believe Goro knows who did it.
{30360}{30485}So, don't count him out yet. Okay?
{30732}{30762}Kio!
{31092}{31176}Hey! Police! It's an emergency!
{31184}{31228}Oh! Let's go!
{31889}{31918}There!
{32294}{32406}Hurry! Hurry! Hurry, please!|Run across the bridge!
{32417}{32461}What's going on?
{32986}{33015}Come on!
{34209}{34238}There it is!
{34423}{34485}Alright, let's go!
{36062}{36090}Fire!
{36942}{37000}It's in sight!|-We're firing!
{37361}{37393}Look out!
{37947}{38013}Damn... Oh, no...
{38025}{38065}Alright, let's go!
{38813}{38875}Captain, I believe that|thing is our murderer.
{38915}{38948}That thing?!
{39359}{39531}Put me through. Ah, headquarters? This|is Nishima. What's the matter with you?!
{39538}{39631}When you assigned me here I thought I was|going after a criminal! What are you saying?!
{39638}{39745}I need men with pistols and machine guns|right away! Hurry, please! Don't delay!
{39834}{39904}The monster has retreated|into one of the older shafts!
{39906}{39932}Right!
{39977}{40048}Okane! Okane!|-Hurry! Hurry!
{40057}{40114}Hang in there!|-Help is coming!
{40154}{40226}Hey, is he okay?|Stretcher!
{40233}{40264}Okane!
{40306}{40346}Head inside!
{40383}{40436}Right. To the hospital!
{40561}{40684}Boss... If that thing's in|there, let me go after it.
{40688}{40762}Idiot! Going in|there is dangerous!
{40769}{40822}Besides, the military|is on its way here.
{41185}{41223}Let's go!
{42300}{42336}Halt!
{42469}{42504}Thank you for coming.
{42534}{42572}Remove the barrier.|-Yes, sir.
{43411}{43517}First unit, set up!|The rest keep moving!
{43733}{43771}It's filled with water!
{43799}{43843}Alright, let's go.
{44917}{44982}Goro! Goro!
{45257}{45286}Fire!
{46193}{46277}Right. I have an idea!|-Okay! Let's go!
{46357}{46415}Look out! It will|come this way!
{46549}{46591}Here I go!
{48168}{48219}Let's get the debris up front.|-Roger!
{48739}{48787}Hey! Just a moment!
{48890}{48961}Shoot! Fire, please!
{50032}{50168}Are you okay?|Are you okay?
{50364}{50451}I can't believe what we saw.
{50458}{50558}A creature like this is quite amazing.
{50565}{50651}For the Meganuron to have the|strength to do that to a man...
{50653}{50727}You could earn a living finding|proof of their existence.
{50734}{50808}You would expect it|to come from outer space.
{50815}{50919}Oh, I'm with the Seibu Newspaper.
{50974}{51096}It was inside the coal mine, so we can assume|the Meganuron hatched from an egg there.
{51130}{51256}Things that could affect its age range from|temperature and to where it was buried.
{51265}{51324}It may have been around for 3 or 4 years.
{51333}{51468}Although it's difficult to see how old it is,|I have enough data to produce a theory.
{51475}{51517}We understand.
{51525}{51704}This time, the larva changed tactics for a short|period and that created the outbreak of murders.
{51725}{51763}But why did it do that?...
{51822}{51866}How's the excavation going?
{51875}{51998}It was a large cave-in. I regret|that we haven't found him yet.
{52248}{52281}An earthquake!
{53010}{53047}Hello?
{53060}{53191}Yes, this is Chief Scientist Sugahara.
{53200}{53303}Hello. The earthquake we just felt...|Where was its epicenter?
{53313}{53452}We're just finishing... We believe|that it's near the area of Kotowataji.
{53469}{53529}Is the science center certain of that?
{53538}{53790}It's not exact. We think it was near coal mines,|but it wasn't strong enough to damage them.
{53799}{53868}I understand. Keep up the good work.
{53922}{53969}Get the cars.|-Yes, sir.
{54181}{54257}Hey, stop! Stop!
{54686}{54878}That's strange... I don't see how this much damage|could have been made from a shock like that.
{55025}{55075}Look at that guy over there!
{55716}{55790}Hey! Hey! What happened?
{55842}{55873}Is this Shigeru?
{55882}{55943}The last I heard he|was stuck in a cave-in.
{56012}{56122}Kamura! Kamura!|Hang in there! Kamura!
{56126}{56175}What happened to him?
{56182}{56286}Kamura! Kamura! Can you say|something for the Seibu Newspaper?
{56295}{56344}Kamura! Kamura!
{57040}{57097}Thank you...|-Let's get him inside.
{57764}{57797}Kamura!
{57859}{57920}Kamura!
{57986}{58034}Clear the way! Clear the way!
{58484}{58702}Kamura! It's me! Don't you know that|it's me? Take a look at me! It's me!
{58717}{58762}You know what my name is!
{59184}{59230}Shigeru!
{59403}{59440}Shigeru!
{59871}{59913}Shigeru!
{60201}{60315}What's... What's wrong with him?
{60332}{60660}As far as I can tell, he doesn't recognize any of you.|I'm not sure how long this amnesia will last.
{60669}{60826}We'll treat him at the hospital.|We'll take him right away.
{60852}{60888}Let's go...
{61284}{61411}Alright, take it easy.|Close your eyes.
{61471}{61533}Okay, open your eyes.
{61665}{61827}Once more, close your eyes|and take a deep breath.
{62043}{62083}And this is?
{62646}{62743}You were the first one to|see this. Look at it very carefully.
{62858}{62897}Can you remember it?
{63722}{63752}Shigeru!
{64321}{64495}Yes? Yes, they're going to pass over the volcano|tomorrow morning. Yes, this is Nishima.
{64554}{64615}It could erupt tomorrow?
{64690}{64798}It might be wise for them to|stay at their post? I understand.
{64806}{64944}I'll tell them it's urgent. Right, I understand.|I'll do what I can in the morning.
{64953}{65123}I can't believe they're doing it,|just so they can find this monster.
{65130}{65186}I would just blowit off the mainland!
{65517}{65766}This is Kitahara. Unknown object at 50.5 degrees,|20,000 feet, travelling at supersonic speed!
{65775}{65873}What? Did I hear him correctly?
{65881}{66140}Kitahara, Kitahara. This is base. Recommend you|check it out. Recommend that you check it out.
{66148}{66188}Roger, roger.
{66691}{66803}Base, base. This is Kitahara.|This is Kitahara.
{66812}{67002}Object in the sky still travelling at supersonic|speed. It just completed a 1 1/2 times vertical loop.
{67009}{67047}What?! One and a half?
{67058}{67140}The object is still travelling at a high speed.
{67148}{67264}Kitahara! Kitahara! Pursue it!|Escape if it comes after you!
{67271}{67310}Roger, roger!
{67839}{67882}It's coming back towards me!
{68037}{68111}It's moving too fast to avoid it! Damn!
{68182}{68252}Kitahara! Kitahara!
{68383}{68442}It's impossible!
{68461}{68545}But the radar showed|what happened in the air.
{68553}{68694}Is that what you think? How can something|that size manueuver so quickly in the air?
{68703}{68823}Of course, I don't know... but perhaps if|it had registered at other installations...
{69139}{69213}What do you think it was?
{69228}{69345}It didn't look anything|like a flying saucer.
{69506}{69622}Yes? Huh? Yes... Just a moment.
{69629}{69669}Excuse me. It's your office.
{69675}{69712}Oh, thank you.
{69731}{69781}Hello. This is lizeki.
{69835}{69895}It's been sighted at other locations?
{69946}{70044}What? They're talking|about flying saucers?
{70079}{70135}I'll be there.
{70143}{70256}I just got word from my office.|They're keeping track of the object.
{70286}{70339}Can't they tell us where it's going?
{70547}{70643}PEKlNG
{71211}{71274}PHlLLlPlNES
{72157}{72200}TOKYO
{72205}{72258}Is the Earth a target?
{72271}{72436}Many people believe that this flying|object is actually a flying saucer.
{72444}{72659}Also, this flying object has reached speeds|that would be impossible for us to achieve.
{72668}{72860}It was sighted in Peking at 11 :00 AM, then|sighted in Manila at 11 :20 AM, both Japan time.
{72979}{73078}Drive carefully on that mountain.|You never know what could happen.
{73085}{73163}We've already had our earthquake.|What else could possibly happen?
{75244}{75378}I can't see how they could both be dead.|There was no one else in the area.
{75387}{75541}If this was going to be a double suicide, wouldn't|their camera and shoe be close by them?
{75549}{75647}Really?|-Also, they wouldn't be apart.
{75660}{75769}This mess doesn't add|up to anything, huh?
{75828}{75956}These men would like to speak with you|later, regarding three missing cows.
{75966}{76014}We want to tell you about it.
{76125}{76181}The film is developed.|-Oh, it's done!
{76239}{76310}Hey, take care of those two.|-Yes, sir.
{76344}{76431}Iizeki, this is the film from the camera.
{76491}{76596}Of course... This looks like|two typical newlyweds...
{76672}{76717}What is that?
{76761}{76942}Doctor, could that be a flying saucer?|It looks a lot like... an animal.
{77809}{77896}Is that it?|-There's no mistake. It's a Pteranodon.
{77903}{77998}Haiyama... If it is, it's travelling very fast.
{78008}{78076}But wasn't this photograph taken recently?
{78085}{78314}The Pteranodon roamed the earth about two|million years ago. How could it be captured on film?
{78322}{78479}But is this a Pteranodon? Do you mean one of them|lives in the mountain and no one knows about it?
{78489}{78595}After all that, you expect|me to believe such a thing?
{78597}{78683}Yes. The characteristics are|the same as in this photo.
{78829}{78930}If one still exists, what|can we do to catch it?
{79035}{79072}Go ahead...
{79767}{79958}Shigeru, look at them. They're so|cute. Do you knowwhat they are?
{84731}{84832}Shigeru! Shigeru!
{85359}{85454}Kio!|-Shigeru!
{85464}{85606}Kio... I... What did l...
{85669}{85828}Shigeru... you're out|of danger! You are...
{85942}{86021}That's it... There's no doubt about it.
{86170}{86203}Thank you!
{86286}{86401}This was the thing that was eating|the creatures inside of the mountain?
{86410}{86662}Yes. I saw it with my own eyes...|This thing was eating them.
{86669}{86772}Alright, I know what we|have to do. Come with me.
{89173}{89217}Incredible...
{90392}{90511}This is it. I'm certain|this is where the egg was.
{90519}{90630}If it is Kamura, why aren't|there any remnants of the egg?
{90718}{90869}The cave-in may have covered|it up. It could have...
{91198}{91289}Doctor, this is it!|This is part of the egg!
{91296}{91348}This is part of the egg?|-lt is.
{91483}{91529}Hey, it's a cave-in!
{91578}{91652}Hey! Get out! Hurry!
{92096}{92135}The tests are completed.
{92163}{92221}The results are very good.
{92228}{92282}Percent data?|-Ninety percent.
{92313}{92520}Really? Judging from the cell structure, I'd say|this creature was reptillian. See for yourself.
{92713}{92827}Of course... The egg matches perfectly.
{92835}{93027}The problem is guessing the size of the egg|based on the inner curve of this section.
{93645}{93864}I can't believe the size of this egg. You might hear|about an egg like this in the book, "Arabian Nights"...
{93930}{94112}You'd think an egg like that came from space.|But for nature to produce an egg like that...
{94122}{94208}This egg is a product of|both nature and man.
{94297}{94384}I don't think this will|determine its final size.
{94392}{94447}But, you...|-No, thank you.
{94454}{94500}This confirms my theory.
{94646}{94920}To repeat, this Pteranodon is a life form|that is alive due to unusual circumstances.
{94928}{95045}We have determined that this creature|is part of the species called Rodan.
{95053}{95333}Its wingspan will reach 270 meters and it will|weigh one hundred tons when fully grown.
{95467}{95650}The Rodan's strength was discovered to be|similar, but more powerful that its cousin's.
{95660}{95850}It's a sonic boom. Since it flies at supersonic speeds,|it's natural that its wings create the phenomenon.
{95949}{96033}Professor, I have a question.|-Go ahead.
{96079}{96225}If a Rodan is among us now, has the|Professor thought about how it survived?
{96330}{96448}I have a theory regarding that question.
{96518}{96774}From what I've concluded, radiation and atomic|bombs may have been the spark that gave it life.
{96782}{97073}It may have seeped into the caverns from the outside|and this new energy revived Rodan from its stasis.
{97080}{97128}That's what I think.
{97159}{97281}But... could that be all?|-No, there may be other factors...
{97293}{97365}But I haven't fully explored them yet...
{97390}{97565}Professor, the real problem is where do we|begin our search for Rodan. Is there one spot?
{97626}{97819}There's no doubt... Near these coal mines and|in this general area would be the likely spot.
{97830}{98034}It would go beyond these two areas if|there were a drought or shortage of food.
{98041}{98126}This should be enough|of an area to begin.
{99231}{99267}What's that?
{99410}{99507}That's it! That's definitely it!|That's the thing I saw!
{99848}{99921}Alright! Head back|and inform headquarters!
{101268}{101382}What?! Rodan is coming?|Right, I understand!
{104663}{104702}Damn!
{104871}{104921}Jets two and three are left!
{104947}{105095}Base, base. This is limura.|Rodan is still in the air.
{105101}{105198}Alright... Continue pursuing the monster!|Continue pursuing the monster!
{105211}{105244}Roger, roger!
{106352}{106390}Over there!
{107596}{107783}Everyone, please make your way to|the buses! Hurry! Go to the buses!
{108060}{108085}Let's go!
{109013}{109056}We did it!
{111021}{111194}Rodan is changing course. We have scored|at least one hit. Its speed is down to half.
{112375}{112420}Here it comes!
{113078}{113149}Hurry! Hurry, hurry!|Quickly! Quickly!
{114402}{114470}Order our forces to attack|it while it's on the ground!
{114507}{114635}Mobile armored units, move into|position while it's attacking the city.
{114642}{114718}Open fire on Rodan as|soon as you are able.
{120932}{121069}There's another! There isn't just one!|We have sighted a second Rodan!
{121075}{121109}Over there!
{121186}{121277}I see the second one!|It's coming from the ocean!
{121283}{121333}Have all available units begin|attacking the one in the air!
{121336}{121399}Yes, sir! I'll order an|air assault right away!
{122675}{122757}How's the battle going?|-Take a look! One of them did this.
{122769}{122854}Incredible! And Rodan?...
{122884}{122951}He got away.|-Got away?!
{122985}{123081}It's not from this area. I think it|went back to where it had hatched.
{123768}{123921}It's unusual, but our intelligence doesn't|know where either of the Rodan's could be.
{123930}{124013}Do you think the two have left the area?
{124019}{124142}No. I'm certain that both Rodan's|are in the Mount Aso region.
{124155}{124194}Mount Aso region?
{124223}{124396}The truth is, these animals are assisting each|other. They'll stay in a place that's easily defended.
{124415}{124600}If we were to use the camera film as testimony,|I'd say that they were staying in that area now.
{125130}{125177}We are in the area now.
{125185}{125221}Please take us down.
{125605}{125688}There it is!|-Ah! We've found one!
{125835}{125946}Professor, you were right!|-Yes. It's a splendid bird.
{126300}{126523}Unit number one will concentrate|their attack in this vicinity.
{126531}{126809}At the same time, unit number two will attack this|area. The explosions should bury both Rodan's.
{126815}{126926}Just a moment please. Could that|cause Mount Aso to erupt?
{126960}{127034}We don't believe that the|attack will cause an eruption.
{127040}{127184}It's not so absurd! How could you|ignore the possibility of it happening?
{127193}{127268}But...|-No I'm opposed to the idea!
{127280}{127433}Sugahara, of course there is always some|kind of risk in an operation like this.
{127448}{127598}That's not what I'm talking about.|The people... Their livelihoods...
{127604}{127783}Listen, what would happen to the Kyushu|area if we allowed the Rodan's to live?
{127792}{127932}Unless you have a better idea, we|cannot be bothered by such complaints!
{130337}{130671}Headquarters, this is command outpost.|We have three platoons ready to attack. Over...
{130675}{130818}Yes, this is Nishima. Yes. All of|our units are ready for the attack.
{130825}{130944}We will inform you when our|advance has stopped. Right. Roger.
{130984}{131052}Have unit one set their position|and prepare to attack.
{131055}{131126}Right. I'll contact unit one|and tell them to stand ready.
{131133}{131298}Unit number one, unit number|one, prepare to attack.
{131812}{131855}Kio!
{131983}{132042}Shigeru!|-You're not supposed to be here!
{132045}{132103}I know.|-Then why are you here?!
{132124}{132208}I don't know why I came. I'm sorry.
{132332}{132489}Thank you. It's dangerous out|here, so let's hurry inside.
{132904}{132970}Unit one is ready to attack!|-Open fire!
{132977}{133036}Yes, sir! Open Fire!|-Right! Open fire!
{133045}{133133}Open fire!|-Fire!
{135638}{135804}It's an emergency! The attack is affecting|the mountain. It may erupt at any time!
{135858}{135899}What do we do?
{135981}{136076}Alright... We'll continue our attack.
{138640}{138695}Unit number two is ready to attack!
{138719}{138803}Alright... Open fire!|-Open fire!
{140856}{140891}It's Rodan!
{145798}{145889}Give the order to cease fire.|-Give the order to cease fire.
{145964}{146105}All units are ordered to cease fire.

This is the salton sea
in Southern California.
A strange phenomenon, in which nature
has placed 400 square miles
of salt water in the middle of an arid desert.
In the desert, near the shore of the sea,
the government has established
one of its most important naval research bases.
At the laboratory on the secluded
south tip of the base,
top-secret atomic experiments
are carried out under rigid security control.
At the airfield, under the direction
of the parachute test unit,
planes leave on daily missions
for the jump area over the salton sea,
where Navy men dive in the government's
continuous researching of parachutes,
to meet the ever-increasing demands
of modern flight.
On may 17, in the early afternoon,
an earthquake occurred in the desert area.
Its force was strong enough to be felt
at the research base,
even though its epicenter was 10 miles away
in the wild rock formations 350 feet
below the surface of the salton sea.
However, less than 2 hours
after the earthquake,
the base was back to normal operating procedure.
Lt. Hollister, of the parachute test unit,
was preparing to make
the last-scheduled jump of the day.
Hollister was a veteran of over 300 test flights.
For him, this was to be one more routine jump.
Meanwhile, on the salton sea,
crewmen Johnson and Sanders
were headed out to meet lt. Hollister.
And for them,
this was to be one more routine pickup.
This is flutterboy 2-4-2 calling Navy 8-7.
You are now in sight. Over.
Hollister now
preparing to jump. Over and out.
He's down.
Navy 8-7, this is flutterboy 2-4-2.
Over.
This is Navy 8-7. Over.
He's in sight.
You're clear to return to the base. Over.
Roger. Leaving for home.
Over and out.
Flutterboy 2-4-2 calling land radio 4. Over.
Land radio 4. Come in.
Jumper landed safely.
He's down about 2-miles in,
off the southeast tip.
That's pretty far out. Hope this doesn't take all night.
Yeah, I'll call you back.
Where is he?
I don't know.
He's gotta be here.
I saw him hit.
Hey, lieutenant!
I'm going down for him.
You see him?
No. I'll try the other side.
Johnson?
Johnson!
Johnson!
Johnson!
Uh.
Ah!
Ah!
This is land radio 4 calling flutterboy 2-4-2.
Come in, please.
Land radio 4 calling flutterboy 2-4-2.
Come in.
Come in, flutterboy 2-4-2.
El centro base.
Naval intelligence, please.
Cmdr. Twillinger's office.
He's on the other line.
Okay, I'll put you on hold.
Lieutenant, I appreciate your calling, but there's nothing I can do.
He went awol, it doesn't matter what the circumstances were.
I'll have to refer the case.
Wait a minute!
In the 1 week that I've been here,
I've had a dozen different cases come up.
I don't decide these things.
I'm an investigating officer, not a judge.
All right,
I'll send you notification.
I know this guy. He's all right.
He made a mistake, but...
He sure did!
Commander, Wyatt on 3.
Wyatt?
He's our radioman at the salton sea pier.
Twillinger. Yes, Wyatt.
How long ago?
45 minutes.
No, I've lost radio contact.
It's not a mechanical failure at this end.
Have a boat standing by.
I'll be there in 5 minutes.
Trouble?
The last pickup crew hasn't reported in.
We'll have to go out.
Sally, wait until I call you.
Yes, sir.
Still there, mom?
Looks like ironheart's gonna work late again tonight.
That's right.
Shove off.
I don't see why they weren't covered for something like this.
They jump close to 20 men every day.
It's a good system, nothing goes wrong.
Something went wrong this time.
A boat off the port bow, sir.
She looks deserted.
Head up alongside.
Aye.
It's Sanders.
Check the water for the other men.
Yes, sir.
Sam.
Look at this.
What is it?
I don't know.
You better take a sample.
Have the lab run a test.
Commander, there's something surfacing on the portside.
It's Hollister.
Like I told you, he said he'd call me back later and that was all.
That's when you lost contact?
Yes, and I called the base.
When you talked last, was everything normal?
Yes. We was just kiddin', you know how you get on the phone.
That's against regulations.
Yes, sir.
Have a report in my office in the morning.
Yes, sir.
May I have that sample we took off the boat?
Right here.
How long's that autopsy on Hollister gonna take?
We'll have it early tomorrow.
I'll cover it for you.
Take some divers and go after Johnson in the morning.
It's too late to dive now.
Okay.
I want to take this to the lab.
It's right there.
Go through the main door and turn to your right.
I've already spoken to Dr. Rogers.
Good.
We won't need you anymore, Wyatt.
Thank you, sir.
That your new boss?
Yeah.
Sure is an eager beaver, sir.
Yeah, that he is.
You might know I'd be making eight carbons.
I said I'm always making eight carbons when my fingers go to...
Hello.
Is this Dr. Rogers' office?
Yes.
I'm cmdr. Twillinger.
I'll tell him.
I think you were notified that I was coming.
I was sorry to hear about the accident.
Young lady, you're not to discuss that with anyone. Do you understand?
No, of course not.
I'm Dr. Rogers, commander.
Twillinger.
Lt. Clemens said you have a substance to be analyzed.
I do. It's in here.
Come on, let's take a look at it.
Where did you find this?
On the boat, near the body.
Lt. Clemens told me what happened.
I'm terribly sorry.
We lost 3 men, so far.
At least, we think it's 3.
We've only recovered 2 bodies.
He said there was something unnatural about the condition of one of the bodies.
There was. It was shriveled.
Shriveled?
Sometimes seawater does strange things to human flesh.
In this case, I don't think so.
Would you say that the water in the sea could be radioactive?
Commander, let me answer you in this way.
My 2 assistants do a lot of diving related to our work.
I know that.
We don't take any chances with radioactivity.
Our sea experiments had nothing to do with what happened to your men or the condition of that body.
You might be wrong.
I've found that people are always jumping to wild conclusions concerning atomic reaction.
Science fact and science fiction are not the same.
Not in the least.
Just take a few minutes.
Can you make it as fast as possible?
It'll only take a little while, as long as I'm not interrupted.
I'll be outside.
Gail, I'm returning your child in the same condition as when I got her. I think.
Hi, sweetie.
Hi, mommy.
Excuse me.
It's all right.
May I go look at the rabbits?
Not today, sweetie.
Please. Hm-mmm.
Mommy, of all those rabbits, i like grace the best.
You can't see her today.
That's okay,
I've got a ladybug to keep me company.
Gail, when will the boys be finished?
They got tied up because of the earthquake and had to reset all the tests.
Oh.
Hey. 2 minutes.
Your wife and unborn child are starving.
A minute and a half.
What a life!
Did I ever tell you that I detest this lab?
That husband of mine even has "top secret" stamped in red ink in the middle of his chest.
He does. "Secret, secret, secret."
You can't speed up science.
I guess not.
Would you like to hold my ladybug?
Hmm?
I said, "would you like to hold my ladybug?"
Certainly. It's a privilege.
Honey, don't bother him.
That's all right.
Doesn't she have pretty spots on her back?
Yes, she has.
Commander?
It's just a simple marine secretion, although there is something that puzzles me.
I'd like to run another series of tests on it tomorrow.
I'll call you.
I'll wait for your call.
You can get me on 254.
That's right.
My ladybug.
You forgot my ladybug!
Maybe it's on the floor somewhere.
Don't worry about it.
Sandy, you can find another ladybug.
But I don't want another one, mommy.
I tell you what, when I get home,
I'll see if I can find her.
If I do, I'll bring her back, okay?
Okay.
He's cute.
I guess so.
Did you mention that you were available?
Somehow it didn't come up.
If I were you, it would have.
You're a character.
Ready to go home now?
I guess so.
I'm leaving now, doctor.
'Night.
Excuse me.
That's okay.
Just consider me a piece of furniture.
Sandy, come here.
Look. I've got a surprise for you.
I found her for you.
Thank you.
I'll give her a good talking to.
I wouldn't be too severe on her.
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Cmdr. Twillinger?
That's right.
Nate brown.
How do you do?
You know Josh Peters, sheriff's office.
We've met.
I've been with this office for 15 years, but I've never seen anything like this.
Have you, Josh?
Afraid not.
I've seen a lot of people die in different ways.
What caused it?
It's hard to tell.
A puncture wound, I think.
Both bodies taken from the sea were totally drained of blood and water.
What would make that happen?
I have no idea.
The wound could've been made by any sharp object and naturally the body would bleed.
But simple bleeding wouldn't cause this.
It happened near the research lab?
Yes. But they say there's no connection.
Maybe.
Take a look at the microscope.
You're looking at a piece of skin.
Usually when a body is left in water, the epidermal tissues become swollen.
But this is like leather.
It doesn't even resemble human skin anymore.
Skin on a man over 100 would have
3 times the amount of moisture.
What about the other man we found on the boat?
A stroke.
A stroke?
There's a technical name for it, but that's what it amounts to.
I don't understand you.
What could cause a stroke in a man that young?
In that age group, only 2 things could cause a stroke:
Violent anger or fear.
You can rule out anger.
Hm-mmm.
In my opinion, the man you found on the boat was literally scared to death.
Do you have enough deputies to post a quarantine on all the beaches until we find out what happened out there?
Yeah. I'll get right on it.
Good.
Thanks again for your help.
Not at all.
You boys care for a sandwich?
Got tuna fish and minced ham on rye.
No, thanks.
It's nice and cold.
Close the beach? I got
22 people staying here.
Sorry, we've got orders.
Nothing we can do.
That's swell. So everybody should go home, is that it?
Did you look at the temperature today?
Yes, we know it's hot.
120 at 3:00. So nobody swims.
What's wrong with the water?
We got a bulletin, Mr. Davis.
That's all we know!
Okay.
Dr. Rogers' office.
Yes, commander. Just a moment.
Dr. Rogers,
cmdr. Twillinger on line 1.
Yes, commander.
Yes, we're working on it.
We hope to have something, late today or tomorrow.
Tomorrow! Look, doctor, that's the only clue we've got.
I could have sent it to San Diego by now.
Hold on, commander, don't pressure us.
We don't need it.
I'll call you as soon as I finish.
I'll be in my office.
I've just been read the riot act by our friend from naval intelligence.
Don't let him bother you,
I'll give you a character reference.
I'm ready to run a geiger count on the stuff from los Alamos.
Good, go ahead.
That's strange.
Is that the stuff from the boat?
Yes.
What's it register?
And your last reading on the salton sea?
Normal, 0.034 constant.
That's odd. This is from the same water.
Why the difference in the radioactivity?
We'd better run a check test.
Hello, Larry.
Mrs. Simms.
Bob. What'll it be?
We'd like to talk about your beach.
About my beach?
I'm going now, ma.
All right. Jody.
Jody!
Yes.
Who you going out with?
You know.
I said, "who?"
Morty.
Morty.
Sure, I might have known.
I got nothing against servicemen, but that morty's no good.
You hear that?
I hear.
Ma, look at me.
I'm a big girl now. Grown up.
Can't you understand that?
You won't pay attention to me anymore.
That isn't what I mean.
I don't want to hurt you.
But there are times when I've got to use my own judgment about things.
It has to be that way.
Please try to understand.
All right.
Just you get home early.
I will.
I got a terrible headache.
I'm sorry, ma.
Goodnight.
You were saying?
About your beach.
I'm afraid you'll have to close it up temporarily.
No swimming.
Mort?
Mort?
Where you been?
Ma, she's...
Ma what?
Nothing.
She's screaming at everybody tonight.
Forget it.
Pretty girl. Ha.
Pretty girl, where's your suit?
Underneath, silly.
It's sure a beautiful night.
Did you get a look at that moon?
Catch me.
Come on. I'll race you to the float.
You haven't got a chance.
Morty.
Morty?
Mort.
Mort.
Ah.
Ah! Ah!
Ah!
I'll tell you what happened.
That boy ran off somewhere with Jody.
I know it.
He's no good.
I warned her. I said,
"why don't you go out with a nice young man?"
But no, she's just like her father was:
No sense.
The boy didn't report back to the base at all last night.
Are you sure he was with your daughter?
Of course I'm sure.
Did you see him?
I didn't have to see him.
Jody herself told me she was going out with him.
Uppity as you please.
And after all I've sacrificed and done for her, not a word of appreciation.
You'd think that at least she'd...
May we take a look around?
No, go ahead.
Her room's in there.
Let me have it.
No, give it.
Wait a minute.
I don't care. Give it to me.
It's mine, I found it.
There's some kids out there with a sailor's cap.
What?
Some kids.
What do kids got to do with it?
I don't know.
Give it to me.
I don't care.
Come here. Just a minute, son.
Let me take a look at that cap.
Did you find this cap?
That boy, Freddy, was trying to take it from me.
Yes.
Where'd you find it?
Over there.
It don't belong to nobody.
It don't belong to you, does it?
No, it doesn't.
Will you show me where you found this cap?
Come on.
There.
What's that?
A uniform or at least part of one.
Did your daughter and her boyfriend ever swim here?
Swim? I don't know.
You don't think they could...
Jody!
Jody!
Oh.
Oh, baby!
I could cut out my tongue for the things I said to you.
Oh, baby.
Josh!
Josh!
What's up?
I don't know.
But that's the same thing we found on the side of the boat.
Dr. Rogers says it's highly radioactive.
I better call and have him investigate the bottom of the sea, before somebody else is killed.
Man, it's cold down there.
I'll get price to get you some coffee.
Do you want us to move out again?
No, not yet.
There's a rock formation i want to check with a geiger counter.
As soon as I fix my regulator.
Thanks.
Any sign of them?
Nothing. Those kids are probably off on a honeymoon.
I hope so.
That's it.
Thanks.
Okay, let's go.
Keep a sharp eye, will you?
Believe me, we haven't seen a thing, except a few fish the size of your left hand.
Fine. Just be careful.
Sure thing.
How rough does it usually get?
It depends on the wind.
As a rule, there's not much current.
Then if the bodies are down there, they'll be easy to find.
Should be. Unless...
Unless what?
I'd rather not conjecture.
Okay?
Yes, sir.
We've got you on the frequency.
Right.
We're still descending.
What's your depth?
40 feet.
60 feet. We're leveling off.
Good. Try a reading.
Doctor, I'm now checking
the rock formation.
Reading is normal.
Normal. Good.
What's the bottom like?
Doctor, about the same.
We're going down again.
It looks like there may be
some kind of cave out under us.
How deep are you?
80 feet.
Still dropping.
That's most unusual.
Why?
We've been over this area a dozen times, the maximum depth is 65 feet.
Don't take any chances.
Don't worry.
97 feet.
100.
125.
We've leveled off again.
I think we're at the bottom
of some kind of huge cavern.
We see some kind of peculiar object ahead.
Hang on.
Doctor, I get a reading of 1.038.
What is it?
I'm not sure.
Some kind of marine growth, I think.
Circular. About 6 feet.
Almost transparent.
We'll try to cut it loose.
I'll send down a net.
Lower the net, boys.
Okay. Take it up.
Is everything all right?
No problems.
We're still looking.
Hold off and come up till we check what's in the net.
Okay.
We've found the girl.
Can you get her up quickly?
It'll only take a minute.
Okay, but don't take any longer.
My tank.
What' s wrong?
Blake's tank is caught
in the undergrowth.
Do you need any help?
No, we're okay.
Oh!
Johns!
Johns!
Answer me, Johns!
I'm okay. It got Blake.
What're you talking about?
I'm coming up. Get help.
Oh, my god.
What happened?
Oh, my god. His body.
He died right in front of me.
I couldn't help him.
I've got to go back.
Talk sense. What's down there?
I don't know, I never saw anything like it.
Like what?
A creature. A giant creature.
You're not going back down there.
Take your hands off me, i 've got to kill it!
I said, "you're not going back down!"
Stay out of this,
I'll take care of him.
There's no time for hysterics.
What are we fighting?
I don't know.
Was there just one of these creatures?
I think so. There was a cave, outside that thing.
An egg.
That must be one of its eggs.
Behind you!
The eye. Get the eye!
Keep those depth charges moving.
Hurry up, boys, we don't have much time.
The commander wants to leave in 5 minutes.
The Pentagon is sending admiral greenhouse for the conference.
Good. We're keeping the egg in the lab under observation.
We should know more about it by then.
I issued a press release saying the Navy is conducting routine tests with underwater explosives.
That should cover us for the moment.
No sense in starting a panic.
Excuse me, sir.
They're about finished loading.
You want to take a look?
Be about 5 minutes, doctor. Excuse me.
Would you sign these?
Did you get a hold of Connie?
No, but I left word for her to come down here.
Thank you.
If you have any problems, let us know.
The chief of staff has authorized full cooperation.
We'll see you in the morning.
Thank you, captain.
What's going on?
Did Mars finally invade us?
Another secret?
Where's George?
Where's George?
Connie, I couldn't help it.
Where's George?
What's happened to my husband?
Connie, step in here with me for a moment.
Where's Dr. Rogers?
He's in the radio shack.
He's with Connie.
Oh.
We're about ready to shove off.
Leave them alone, please.
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
I don't think you are.
What's wrong?
I should be with Connie, telling her how you get over it.
The trouble is, you don't.
I mean, I didn't.
Would you like a cigarette?
No, thank you.
When tom was killed, they said all those things to me.
Tom?
My husband.
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
It's funny, you go around for days and you don't believe it.
You think it can't be true.
And one of those days you get to thinking,
"it is true.
He isn't coming home."
And you say it out loud,
"he isn't coming home."
Don't listen to me,
I'm over it now.
It was 2 years ago.
I couldn't go in there with Connie.
Not right now.
What did your husband do?
He was a pilot.
He was stationed in San Diego.
Sandy and I moved here afterwards.
It takes a great deal of courage to start over.
I had a lot of happiness, a lot of things to think about and remember.
And I had Sandy.
I couldn't fall apart.
I guess not.
You know something?
You're easy to talk to, and I didn't think you would be.
Gail.
Yes, doctor.
Would you take care of Connie, please?
Of course.
We're waiting for you, doctor. How is she?
She's resting.
She'll be all right.
Good.
Men, Dr. Rogers has some final instructions for you.
Everything that's happened, or that will happen on this expedition, is classified
"top secret." Is that clear?
We've crippled and may have killed this giant creature.
To make sure it's dead, we're going to saturate the area with depth charges.
But our most important job is to find all its eggs.
Once they're located,
Dr. Johns will make a quick survey of them and then they must be totally destroyed.
Cmdr. Twillinger will be in charge of the underwater demolition.
I guess that's all.
All right, men. Let's go.
Believe me, it's best for you to stay here tonight.
I've got plenty of room.
What are they doing?
Come on.
What you see here is the formation inside the egg sac we found near the creature's lair.
You'll notice the shell is beginning to harden.
There's quite a bit of definition in the head.
Until our studies are completed, we're keeping it alive by controlled water temperature.
You'll notice that the thermostat reads
38 degrees exactly.
Is there any danger that the egg might hatch?
No, the temperature is low enough to keep it from hatching.
As long as this knob is set so the temperature remains constant, there'll be no problem.
I see.
Gentlemen, we believe that this creature is of the same family as the historically documented kraken.
A giant sea beast that was the direct ancestor of the modern water mollusk.
I've had some film of common mollusks flown in from San Diego.
I'd like you to compare it with the creature that attacked us.
Dr. Johns?
Yes. Right this way, please.
Sheriff, would you cut the lights, please?
As most of you know, the mollusk family is comprised of animals with a soft body usually covered by a hard shell.
This is gonaxis kibweziensis.
It's one half inch in diameter.
You'll note the similarities between it and the giant creature in the salton sea.
For example, the gonaxis has a predatory nature.
It attacks other living creatures, will devour them, eat their flesh.
The larger it is, the larger its appetite.
This is a branch of the gonaxis, the euglandia.
It shreds the flesh of its victim with scissor-like teeth.
Some species suck out the body fluids in much the same manner as the creature with which we're dealing.
As I mentioned, most of these creatures live entirely in the water.
But it's not unusual to find them on land, searching for food.
The same thing is true of our kraken.
These mollusks are only recently hatched, yet they're as large as the adult.
The reason being that they developed to full growth within the egg sac.
From the instant they're born, they're hungry.
That bubbly secretion you see is formed in the digestive system.
It acts as a defensive weapon.
Incidentally, it's chemically similar to the secretion we found on the boat.
That'll give you an idea.
It's interesting, but what's the point?
The creature was killed and all the eggs were destroyed.
That's right, but we're not sure we destroyed all the other creatures.
Do you think that more than one has developed?
We're sure of it.
From the number of shells in these photographs,
I'd say there are at least 10 of these giant creatures, each one with the capacity to lay several thousand eggs in its life cycle.
There was a cave here which we sealed with explosives and probably trapped the rest of them inside.
We have to be sure, doctor.
That's impossible, because the mouth of that cave is covered with tons of rock.
If any did escape, it will have to surface sooner or later.
It won't find enough food in the salton sea, it'll get hungry.
We can keep a 24-hour beach patrol.
Yes, I think that's imperative.
But our real danger doesn't lie at the sea.
Let's remember that these creatures can travel overland, too.
A few miles from here is the all-American canal system, which irrigates the entire imperial valley and then in time empties into the Gulf.
I don't want to alarm you unduly, but if just one of these creatures lived and got by the patrols, into the canal system and multiplied, the species could threaten the entire world.
First, devouring all life in the oceans and then, foraging on land.
Can you imagine an army of these things descending on one of our cities?
What caused it?
Where'd they come from?
We don't know, we can only guess.
Perhaps you saw this article here in life.
A few miles from here, this lakebed existed in a dry state, void of life for many years.
Then a flash flood filled it with about 2 feet of water.
In a few days, there were millions of shrimp in that lake.
They hatched from dormant eggs that were there for centuries.
I believe the same thing happened here.
I think that a pocket of eggs from this prehistoric species was trapped here, below the bottom of the salton sea.
Suppose an earthquake caused a fissure to open at the bottom of the sea, allowing water to seep down to this pocket.
Because this water was slightly radioactive, and because the eggs had a capacity to absorb this radioactivity, they found an environment that was perfect in which to hatch and grow.
Then a more severe earthquake widened the fissure, allowing these creatures to escape into the sea.
I'd like to alert the civilian defense.
Mr. Patterson, there are
100,000 people in this valley.
A move like that would lead to hysteria.
I suppose that's true.
I think we should set up a joint patrol around the sea, combine your staff with the sheriff's office, set up a headquarters at the air base and coordinate from there.
Does that sound practical to you?
Yes, sir.
How about your office, sheriff?
Sounds fine to me.
I'm due to report back to joint chiefs of staff.
I'll tell them that even if there are some surviving creatures, there's still no national danger.
Unless, as you said, some escape from the sea into the all-American canal.
That's correct.
I'll be in touch with you, commander.
Call me if anything develops.
Very good, sir.
Good day, gentlemen.
Good day. Good day.
The governor advised me to offer you any assistance you may need.
We appreciate that very much, thank you.
Yes, doctor.
I think we'd better meet in my office to set this up.
Okay.
Good night.
Good night.
Gail, how's Connie?
All right. She's staying with me for a while.
Good.
I feel kind of embarrassed today, commander.
Why?
The personal things i said yesterday,
I hope I didn't embarrass you.
You didn't.
I don't usually carry on that way.
You ought to, at least once in a while.
We're on our way back to the base now, and we have to eat sometime.
What I mean is, why don't you let me take you to dinner tonight?
I found a wonderful place to eat in mexicali.
Thank you, but i can't leave Connie.
I mean, I shouldn't.
Okay.
I'm awfully sorry.
If you should change your mind...
I never do.
If you should, the number's 254.
You already have it.
So I have.
Good night.
Good night.
Anything happening?
Nothing. Nothing but moonlight.
Wallace and hanson will replace you at 10:00.
Thanks.
Okay.
That about ties it up.
This reminds me of last year.
We had a stakeout on a federal bank for 3 months.
What happened?
Not a thing.
You sure you won't come home and take potluck?
Jenny wouldn't mind.
Much.
No, come on!
No, I'll get something from the cafeteria.
Okay, see you later.
You bet.
This is just like that federal bank stakeout last year.
The only trouble is, nothing ever happens.
No, mom.
I don't know. Yes, I'll hurry.
No, I don't know how late.
This is Walker, section 5 north. All clear.
Check.
Oni, twillinger.
Hi.
I had to come to town with some reports for the doctor.
I know it's past dinnertime, but if you hadn't already eaten, I...
Yeah, I'm starving.
Where are you?
Right, I know where it is.
I'll be there in 5 minutes.
Right, goodbye.
I'll check with you in half an hour.
Okay.
You can take mine, too, please.
You certainly don't eat very much.
I don't know how you keep going.
I had a big lunch.
That reminds me,
I'd better check in to base again.
Excuse me.
Nothing's happened so far, nothing at all.
Did you make a wish?
Yes.
I've got a confession to make.
I bet I know what it is.
You're still hungry.
No.
What I said about coming into town wasn't true.
I went home and Connie felt like being alone so that made me feel lonely, too.
So I decided to call you.
That's not a confession, that's a compliment.
You want a ballpoint pen, senor?
What?
Very cheap, senor. 8 pesos.
Big bargain.
No, thanks.
Si!
No.
Much ink inside.
No, thank you.
She will write 2 million miles, no refills.
How much is 8 pesos?
65 cents.
All right, bud.
You got yourself a deal.
Thank you, senor.
Hey, kid, my pen!
What are you grinning at?
Twill.
What's so funny?
That kid walked off with my money.
Your face. You're so serious.
Big bargain.
You're really much too serious.
Maybe you're right.
But I don't think you're like that underneath.
What did you want to do when you were little?
First, I wanted to be a fireman, and then a forest ranger, then I guess i wanted to be a cop.
Really?
Mm-hmm.
Senor, look, you like red?
I got red, white, green, blue, red and white, black and white, green and red...
Blue and white.
No blue and white.
Red, red and white, black and white, green and red...
Look, I'll just take this one.
Go on, scoot. Shoo!
Thank you, senor!
Where were we?
You were just going to take me home.
I'm afraid it's getting very late.
It's only 10:15.
Want to stop at the four oaks for a beer?
I told Betty I'd come right home after our shift.
So you'll be half an hour late.
Take the canal cutoff and we'll be there in 5 minutes.
Check that car ahead.
You better take a look.
Yeah.
What happened? What's wrong?
It. It was...
Better get him to the hospital.
Radio headquarters. Right.
No! Mary Jean.
Mary Jean.
It could have gone a dozen different ways.
Every half-mile, there's a junction and the locks roll open.
I don't understand.
Did you check all the patrols on the sea?
Yes, they're certain nothing got past them.
It's 23 miles from that sea to that canal, and there's no connection by water.
I just got a report.
A farmer 15 miles from here found
2 of his cattle dead.
Shriveled up.
He thinks they were attacked about 10:00 last night.
We know that the boy and girl were attacked here at 10:00.
Of course. There must be an underground river through which they escaped.
A river that leads from the sea to one of the pools near the canal area.
They leave this pool at night, and come around the canals in search of food.
We'll have to patrol the entire canal system.
There's 700 miles of canal bank in this county alone.
That could take us days.
We don't have days.
The egg at the lab was almost hatching when we got it.
We must find their new nest, before they lay any more eggs.
I'll call air national guard.
Their helicopters will work with ours.
We'll check every pool in this valley for their secretion.
Good. Because the possibility of finding one pool out of thousands is remote.
There's the chance that there may be an old survey map that shows where this underground river empties into the pool.
Doctor, if there is such a map, we'll find it.
Come on, we'll use our car.
This is helicopter 2-5, reporting in.
We have covered south basin.
There is no sign of target pool.
Bearing south-southeast.
Well, now, we gave most of our map collection to the library.
We've already been to the library.
We've checked every possible source.
You're our last resort.
Too bad.
We don't have many documents.
We don't have room for them.
We put up a bond issue, proposition 14-a, specifically asking for a document room.
Here.
Here we are.
Is this all you have?
I'm sorry.
Just not a speck of room.
Mr. dobbs, this is very important.
Have you heard of an underground river or ancient waterway that runs through the valley that would empty into a deep pool?
Dear, let me think.
I can't think of a thing.
But every once in a while, somebody dies and leaves us a whole lot of documents for our room, the one we didn't get, you understand.
Proposition 14-a was defeated.
If you hear anything, you can get me at the air base.
Air base?
Yeah, El centro.
Sure. I always cooperate with the authorities.
You'll find I'm a very cooperative person.
Thank you, Mr. dobbs.
Just call on me anytime. Night or day.
Give me Navy intelligence, please.
Oni, yeah.
Lock 23? Lock 23, okay.
46, okay, nothing sighted.
We still haven't spotted the pool where they've nested.
We have the entire irrigation system under patrol.
The gatekeepers at each lock are on 24-hour guard.
Someone is bound to spot one of those creatures.
When they do, we close all the locks and hold it till we arrive.
Then we'll follow it back to the pool.
Sounds like an effective plan.
I'll be in capt.
Master's office.
All right.
How many patrols have checked in?
The gatekeepers have called, except 3.
See if you can get them.
Right.
Sally, try locks 14, 32 and 57.
I'll call you back later, mom.
Lock 57.
Yes, I did try, but the line was tied up.
No, I haven't seen any creature.
Just plain foolishness.
Hey, boys!
Get away from there!
We don't allow no swimming here, you know that.
Go on, now.
Okay.
Don't go in there, Sandy.
We're going home now.
When can we go swimming again?
I don't know, dear.
Then can I go look at the rabbits?
Not today, sweetie.
Dr. Rogers' office.
Yes, just a minute,
I'll read you the figures on that.
That was 2-3-4-5.
Yes, and 5-4-2-3.
Hello, grace. How are you today?
We have to be very quiet, because mommy is so busy.
Poor grace. You're cold.
If I had a nice warm blanket,
I'd put it over you.
Maybe I can figure something out.
There. Is that better?
I gotta go now. Goodbye.
Fine. Goodbye.
Sandy?
Yes, mommy.
Let's go home.
Lock 41, okay.
41, okay.
Proceed eastward on highway 8-0.
Have you heard anything?
Not yet. We'll keep you posted.
What time were the boy and girl attacked last night?
9:30 or 10:00.
It's 9:00 now.
Yeah, I know.
Mm-hmm.
Hey, you kids!
Don't try to hide from me.
Hey, you kids!
Hey, you kids!
Still no answer.
When did you last talk to him?
At 8:00.
Do we have a car in that area?
There's one within half a mile.
You better call it.
Get moar and Walker in car 14.
Right.
This is control operations calling car 14.
This is Walker, car 14.
What've you got?
Proceed to
canal junction 57.
Repeat. Proceed to canal junction 5-7.
Right.
My god. I'll call in.
This is car 14 calling control operations. Over.
Come in, car 14.
Tell Josh we found
the gatekeeper dead,
just like the others.
Have them stay there.
Radio all the patrols.
Roger.
Close everything that leads to lock 57.
We'll try to hold it long enough to follow it.
Right. Sally, give me a line.
Commander!
Could I help you?
I'm here to see cmdr. Twillinger.
Will he be back?
Not for some time.
You just missed him.
I know. Well.
Is there anything I could do?
No.
I think maybe I better wait.
If it's all right?
He may be gone for hours, Mr...
Dobbs. Lewis Clark dobbs.
Mr. dobbs.
Well.
I'll wait.
That's right.
Close the locks south from juncture 302 to 23.
Right. And keep them closed till you hear from me.
I called in the minute i heard that noise.
I thought to myself,
"something's breaking out there."
"There's sure something breaking."
So I come out to see what it was.
And there it was.
Why weren't you out here?
The lock has an emergency release.
You could've stopped it.
Listen, commander,
I was only doing what they told me.
I didn't know you wanted to follow it.
You didn't?
Thanks, anyway.
I know how you feel, but it wasn't his fault.
Twill?
Yeah?
What do we do now?
Wait for another one.
Come on, let's go back.
Commander.
Lewis Clark dobbs.
Hello, Mr. dobbs. What is it?
It's probably not anything at all.
I see.
How's it coming, sailor?
The same, sir.
Nothing?
No, sir.
You said it was important, you know, about the map.
Yeah?
A very strange thing happened.
I was looking for these papers.
Actually, I was looking for this petition.
We're campaigning again for proposition 14-a, the one that was defeated, and there was this folder.
And in the folder, there was this map.
I remembered it because Mrs. de fauna de porto had asked me to take care of it, and then she passed on.
I told you about it, didn't I?
A very great loss.
You see, the de fauna de porto family settled this valley.
A most distinguished family.
Is this a river?
No. But the Indians dug Wells along there, apparently.
Here. It says here, in Spanish, of course,
"the Wells of life."
I read 18 foreign languages.
Clem!
Sir?
Any boys working in the photo lab?
Not now.
Get them down there right now.
I want this blown up and graphed.
Order me a helicopter at dawn and notify Dr. Rogers.
Right.
Drop us down a little.
That's the one.
How do you want to proceed?
We radio for equipment, then dive and destroy them.
Chances are they're dormant now, but any sound may attract them.
So set your charges and get out.
Right.
Are you ready?
Are you?
I think so.
Doctor, your lab's on the mobile phone.
Thank you. Yes, Gail.
I sent you those cylinders you asked for.
They should be there in 10 minutes.
Thank you. We may need them.
Hold on a minute.
Gail?
Yes, twill.
Hi!
Is everything all right?
Are you all right?
Everything's fine. Don't worry.
I'll call you later.
Okay. Twill?
Yeah?
Take care.
I always do.
Goodbye.
I'll take it.
I have you on the frequency.
We're moving through
a dense growth.
Can't tell what's ahead from here.
We've reached the bottom.
We've found them.
Any problems?
No,
I think we can get them all.
It took you
3 minutes to get down.
Allow yourselves
2 minutes leeway.
Will do.
We set the first charge.
The pin on my last charge
is stuck.
Twill, Johns is in trouble.
You're 30 seconds past safe time.
Start up.
You're 42 seconds past safe time.
Start up.
Are you on your way up?
Just a second.
We're on our way up.
You have 25 seconds.
Come on.
Let's help pull them up.
Hurry up.
You fellows all right?
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
I wanna make a check in half an hour, when the sediment clears.
All right.
I'm sorry about what happened down there.
You don't have to be.
I made a mistake.
When I signaled you,
I was sure the pin was loose.
Forget it, anyone's entitled to an honest mistake.
Anyway, you saved my neck.
Thanks.
Excuse me,
I've got a phone call to make.
It's a great relief knowing we got them all.
Yeah.
You know, I guess I was wrong about that guy.
The commander takes a bit of knowing.
Mobile operator.
Give me Dr. Rogers' office.
The Navy lab, salton sea, 2-2-1.
Johns is going to stay to load up.
Would you mind dropping me at the lab?
Sure, jump in.
I called Gail at the lab, but the line was busy.
Oh, really?
They're all down at the pool, sir.
Yes, I will.
Hi, honey.
Hi, mommy.
I got dressed by myself.
And a good job you did, too.
Have you had your orange juice?
Yes.
We'll have breakfast in a little while.
Why don't you go play?
Dr. Rogers' office.
I'm sorry, he's not here now.
I can take a message if you wish.
Yes, captain.
I'm sorry, he was called away.
Grace?
Ah!
Mommy!
Sandy!
Honey, stay where you are!
Mommy!
Mommy!
Don't move!
It's all right, honey.
Someone will come soon and help us.
Mobile operator.
Could you try the Navy lab again?
Salton sea, 2-2-1. That's right.
Still busy.
Want to stop and get some breakfast?
No, thanks.
I had toast and coffee when I got up.
But if you want to stop...
No, I can wait.
Sandy.
Do you see that window?
Yes.
Can you get up there?
Try!
I can't.
Try!
I can't!
Oh, god.
I want you to close your eyes.
I want you to close your eyes and put your head right there.
Don't open them for a little while.
Good morning, commander. Doctor.
Go ahead.
Gail!
Doctor!
Get help!
Get help!
Can you hear me?
Yes.
Can you hear me?
Yes.
Now listen, when I holler come out of there.
Now! All right. Now!
Here, take it easy now.
You're still shaken.
Yes, I am. But i feel all right now.
What about you?
I think I'm all right.
You're just fine, honey.
You know something?
You can go swimming again.
Can I?
Yes, ma'am, you can.
[Thunder cracks]
[Wind howling]
[Lawrence] I don't know if she's still alive or not.
They've had her now for the past 24 hours.
I'm equally uncertain as to the fate of her father,
Professor Elliot.
Both are probably dead.
The odds are 100 to one
I, too, will be finished before another sun rises, but tonight I'm going to try to fight for my life and those larger issues, so perilously at stake, affecting all mankind.
If I fail...
This seems most likely...
The consequences to humanity defy the imagination.
As the only trained reporter who has been in a position to observe the terror from its inception, and as one of the few living humans who has actually met, face to face, the man from planet x.
I will try to set down the strangest story a newspaper man ever covered.
It began prosaically enough in a college observatory not far from Los Angeles what is it?
A new planet.
For want of another name, presently identified as planet x.
It was first spotted some weeks ago rushing out of space.
Is this the reason
Professor Elliot wired me to contact you?
Have you known the Professor long?
Yeah. I was with the eighth air force in england.
The Professor was our chief meteorologist doping out weather for bomber raids.
The British lent him to us.
Good man,
Elliot.
Oh, the best.
He and I became fast friends.
He always said if he ever ran across anything of real importance, he'd give me a crack at it.
Used to think he was kidding, but I guess not.
No, I guess not.
[Lawrence]
What's it all about, doctor?
[Dr. blaine]
The world, Mr. Lawrence, is now experiencing strange astronomical phenomena.
Reports have come in from all over the globe of objects being sighted in the sky.
[Bell rings]
You're not saying a scientist like yourself believes such nonsense.
No. I'm not telling you that.
Then on what evidence do you base your statement?
On questionable reports of trained observers.
First this phenomenon seemed to have no particular focal point, appeared at random here and there about the world.
But about
6 weeks ago, tremendous concentration was detected over a certain section of the earth, in a particularly barren and isolated area.
Burry?
Yes. What do you know about it?
Well, nothing much, except that this cablegram
I got from Professor elliotcame from there.
Says, uh, "if you remember my promise"
"for exclusive story, see Dr. Robert Blaine
"at university observatory."
Signed Elliot.
Strange waves resembling, but still not radar waves, have been bouncing off the earth.
Coming from someplace outside, like the moon or
Mars for instance?
Originating on some sphere outside, but not the moon or Mars or any known planet.
Well, where's this planet x fit in?
What's it rushing##towards?
The earth.
You mean you mean it's likely to collide with us?
No. At least not a headlong collision.
Oh, we've had these things before, like halley's comet for instance, to name one.
None which has come as close to our world as this one is expected to in the next 3 weeks, if our calculations are correct.
You think something will happen?
I wish I knew exactly.
At the best, atmospheric disturbances, hurricanes, probably tidal waves.
And at the worst?
Where does Professor
Elliot fit in?
He discovered the planet.
Oh, is that why he's in burry?
If he's correct in his deductions, this isolated island is that part of the world the new planet will come closest to.
Gee, it sort of makes cold fingers run down my spine.
How about you?
This is not visible to the naked eye.
Not yet.
How do I get to burry?
[British accent]
Here you are, sir.
This is burry.
Uh, do you know
Professor Elliot?
Aye. I've seen him once or twice.
Where's he staying, do you know?
Up at the Brock.
Good evening to you, sir.
Well... hey, wait a minute!
Mr. Lawrence.
Hello.
I'm sorry I was late.
Had a little motor trouble.
Well, better late than never.
Put your things in the back.
All right.
Thanks.
All set?
Yeah. Drive on, macduff.
Fog's getting thicker.
It's always worse on the moors than it is in the village.
You don't remember me, do you?
Well, I, uh...
Isn't that a fine example of how unfaithful men are?
The last time I saw you,
I got your solemn promise that when I grew up
I could be your girl.
Good heavens.
Enid Elliot.
Well,
I thought...
Took you long enough to recognize me.
The last time I saw you you were crying because you had to go back to school.
All gawky legs and buck teeth.
I see you do remember me.
Braces took care of the teeth.
And nature took care of the legs.
I hadn't thought you'd noticed.
It's the newspaper man in me.
What a difference
6 years make.
I don't think you've changed.
Well, thank you kindly, or should I thank you kindly?
Yeah.
Thanks.
Hey what did all this?
Bombs?
Father time.
It's been this way for centuries.
Who ever built this tower up here at the end of nowhere?
[Enid] They call these towers brocks.
Originally built, local legend has it, as a defense against the viking raiders.
Well, come on.
"As of midnight, the 13th of September,
1950, isas follows..." hello.
Professor.
John.
Good to see you.
And you, my lad, and you.
It's a cozy place you have here.
Serves its purpose.
Oh you remember
Dr. mears by any chance?
Mr. Lawrence has forgotten.
I forgive him.
I doubt if he ever expected to see my face again.
Frankly, I hadn't given it much thought.
John and I are starved.
You and Dr. mears have already eaten.
Yes. We had a bite.
Take him down to the kitchen, and fix yourselves something.
It's just a tiny place right here, but home is where the pantry is.
Isn't that so?
That's right.
Come along.
Here. Let us continue.
"1950, is as follows..."
What I lack in talent for cookery,
I make up in speed.
But I really do brew a fine cup of tea.
Well,
I hope so.
How many of these rooms are there?
This one's mine, and there's another one under this.
Dr. mears occupies it.
No thanks.
You have some.
Um-hmm.
Hey, how on earth does he happen to be here?
Oh, you know father, soft-hearted as a sponge.
Mears dropped in on us, 2 weeks ago, pleaded he was ill and broke, and jolly well looked it, too.
And he was one of father's students...
So he's here.
Hmm. Just dropped in?
Um-hmm.
People don't just drop in here, a place on the edge of the world.
I heard he was somewhere in Scotland.
He's been in seclusion since that trouble he got into.
I feel sort of sorry for him.
Well, you needn't.
He should've gotten 20 years.
[Enid] He did go to prison for a while, didn't he?
I was just a kid then.
I trust I'm not disturbing you,
Mr. Lawrence.
Professor Elliot would like to see you upstairs.
Go ahead, John.
I'll be up in a minute, soon as I put away these dishes.
All right.
Didn't interrupt you before you'd finished, did I?
No. No. Just having some tea.
Where's mears?
What? I thought he was behind me.
Hmm. Must have gone to his room.
I called you to take a look at our mysterious visitor before we lose her for the night.
Good.
Fog's rolling in off the moors.
Go ahead, John.
Thank you.
[Lawrence]
It's tripled in size.
[Dr. elliot]
Grows larger nightly.
Well?
What do you think,
Professor?
I think
I'll just have to wait and see on the 17th.
[Dog howls]
Stray dog.
[Laughs nervously]
Eerie place, these moors.
Wet, too.
Yet they have a grim beauty of their own.
That hot tea you drank should've warmed you.
Is that why the
British drink it...
The climate?
And because we like it.
Hello, lightning.
Storm brewing.
I've heard that one may tell how far a storm is by the number of seconds between the lightning and the thunder. True?
Well, let's see.
Huh. Must be in Chicago.
No thunder.
Hmm.
Well, static electricity maybe.
This time of year?
How's the view from the top of the rise?
Pretty if there's anything to be seen.
Well, I'm sure of that.
The village is over there, but the fog's too thick.
You'll have to take my word for the view.
I'll do that and add 3 of my own.
I like it.
We better be getting back. Dad'll worry.
I'll bet right now he doesn't know we're alive.
And it's getting cold.
I hadn't noticed.
Well, which way?
Uh, this.
I think it's closer this way.
Here we are.
Take it easy.
Thank you.
Ooh. I'm sorry.
[Enid] What on earth is that?
[Lawrence]
I don't know.
If I were mechanically minded,
I could probably tell you.
Well, what could it be?
That, as we say back in the states, is the $64 question.
Oh, careful. It might explode or something.
Oh, it's not a bomb.
At least, I don't think it is.
Besides, what would a bomb be doing up here?
Fell out of a plane?
Do any ever fly across here?
The only one that's been anywhere near here in the past 6 months must've been the one that set you off the breakwater.
Well, your father'll probably be able to tell us##what it is.
Oh, you couldn't carry that back to the Brock. It looks...
Nothing to it.
Ah.
The measurements are singularly precise.
Well, what is it?
How does it operate?
If it does or has.
Well, you ask more than
I'm prepared to answer.
A theory might suggest that the inside is hollow, and it might've contained a propulsive element of some kind, a gas perhaps.
Look here.
The metal is discolored, possibly from the generation of some terrific heat.
It's fantastic.
Professor, look.
Interesting.
That should work out at about
1/5 the specific gravity of steel.
That could mean millions, millions if that formula could be reproduced.
I don't know if I follow you.
What do you mean, if that formula could be produced?
Where do you think this came from?
Well, my idea may sound fantastic, may be fantastic for all I can say, but this object...
Comes out of space?
I could not deny the possibility.
Do you realize what this metal could mean?
It's harder than steel.
It has tremendous tensile strength.
And it weighs only
1/5 as much as steel.
The man who controls this formula, controls the industry of the world.
Before you start spending those millions, doctor, consider a slight problem.
What's that?
If the Professor's theory bears any fact you're going to have a little difficulty mining that metal, don't you think?
I was speaking metaphorically, of course.
You reassure me.
Let us concentrate on this remarkable object.
Father, it's quite late.
Shh. The scale is delicate and responds to a breath upon it.
[Yawns]
How long has it been since you slept?
Oh, about 36 hours and
6,000 Miles ago, I guess.
Would you object to sharing a bed with Dr. mears?
No need to inflict myself on him.
Just for tonight.
I noticed an inn at the village.
Tomorrow I'll make dad get rid of mears.
Not on my account.
On my own. He...
Well, he upsets me.
Well, we can't have you getting upset.
Can we?
Where you going?
I'll drive you.
Oh.
See you tomorrow.
Well, good night.
Thanks a lot for everything.
Drive carefully.
Oh, I know every stone in the road.
John?
Yeah?
It's nice having you here.
Thanks.
Good night.
Good night.
[Tire blows]
Confound the luck.
[Sighs]
[Electronic pulsating hum]
Aah!
[Running footsteps]
[Tap, tap, tap]
The light flickered on and off.
It wasn't very bright, a ghastly greenish color.
When I got close to it, it looked like a giant glass ball girdled with something like a steel belt.
3 of them,
I think.
When I got close enough to look in, there it was.
"It?" What?
That face right on the other side of the glass, looking right into mine. I was scared.
Face, a human face?
A ghastly caricature, like something distorted by pressure.
I can't think how else to describe it.
A horrible, grotesque imitation of a face looking right into my eyes.
Now, I know you're not given to hysteria, my dear, but your statements have the tinge of fantasy.
Now, you you say you saw this...
This hideous face.
Yes!
And I ran, really frightened,
I guess, for the first time in my life.
Hmm.
You're not going##out there.
I'd better take a look.
You have a hot drink and get some sleep.
I'll show you.
My dear...
Don't argue.
I'm quite all right.
It was just the first shock.
Now you've got me wondering just what I did see.
I'm going with you.
[Elliot]
All right.
[Enid]
This way.
[Elliot]
Where?
Over the next rise.
[Dog howls]
I don't see anything.
I think it's straight ahead.
[Wind howls]
Look.
Quietly now.
[Electronic hum]
[Elliot]
Can't see much.
No face, at least.
I'm certain of that.
What is it?
Obviously a creation of science.
That's beyond question.
But manufactured by whom and for what purpose?
Careful.
[Hum stops]
Shh. Shh.
Look, the light went out.
[Footsteps from inside]
[Piercing tone]
Down.
[Tone stops]
Let's get away from here.
We should've waited until daylight.
It was senseless coming out here in the dark.
I'm... it's uncanny.
Come on, father.
Get up, father.
Is anything the matter?
Father, do you hear me?
Hurry.
Come on.
Hurry.
[Frogs croaking]
Please wait.
Father, stop!
Father?
Don't stare at me.
Come with me.
Slowly.
[Buzzing]
All I was capable of was obedience when I heard a command.
It was a complete paralysis of the faculties other than blind, slavish movement.
Well, we seem to be confronted by a concrete menace.
Willful.
Hostile.
Do you think...
Could it possibly have something to do with that planet?
Oh, am I glad to see you.
I saw your car.
Is anything the matter?
We've had a case of the jitters.
But I shouldn't keep you out here on the doorstep.
Come on in.
Your theory,
Professor, is that these occurrences are in some way connected with planet x.
Have you a better theory to offer?
No, but, uh, you'll have to pardon me if it takes me a moment to get my bearings.
What do you think this is building up to?
Well, I must confess
I'm beyond my depth.
We have but one theory to work on.
In approximately
60 hours the planet's orbit will bring it into its closest position to this world, burry will be the nearest spot on earth to the planet and whatever and whoever is upon it.
60 hours.
Don't you think we'd better notify the police?
What should we notify them of?
That ball out there.
The gadget enid and I found.
And defeat everything that we've spent all these weeks in this forsaken spot to achieve? Being overrun with the curious?
Somebody's liable to run onto that thing out there.
Oh, it isn't likely.
This area of the moors is checkered with marshes.
Many a straying farm animal has been swallowed up.
This place has a bad name.
The natives keep their distance.
Where's this ball now?
I'll take you.
You can see it from the edge of this rock.
Look.
No sign of life.
You know what that looks like to me?
A big diving bell.
The only difference between water and space is a matter of density.
Hmm. Here.
It's pretty quiet now.
Let's go down and take a look.
[Buzzing]
That everlasting fog they mistake for climate around here.
Come on.
Glass?
I wonder.
It was my wife's.
Diamonds cut glass.
Not a scratch.
Glass and practically any other substance on earth.
This must be tremendously resistant.
I can't think of anything known to man equally so.
And this, you believe, from out of space?
What else?
What's the next step, Professor?
Keep it carefully under observation until the 17th and find out whether it has any connection with what may or may not happen then.
We'd better be getting back.
We don't want to worry enid too much.
Quite right.
[Spacesuit hissing]
That thing he's holding. Watch it.
Don't move.
If he doesn't take the idea and make a move for me, you run.
Run as hard and as fast as you can and come back with help.
Ever tried outrunning the speed of light?
Well, here goes.
This is a universal gesture.
Maybe it'll work.
[Electronic noise pulses]
What's the matter with him?
[Elliot] Hear that hissing noise?
[Lawrence] Sounds like it's coming from that tank on his back.
[Elliot] Probably filled with gas, something like oxygen.
He's trying to regulate it.
[Lawrence] He's trying to turn that knob to the right, but he doesn't have the strength or coordination.
[Hissing grows louder]
Must have decided we're friendly natives.
We've got to find some means of communication.
He's capable of sound.
[Alien noise pulses]
It's an attempt to communicate.
It seems hopeless, though.
It looks as if we're up against a blank wall.
Let's beat it back to the Brock.
What, and leave him?
Question is, will he let us?
It's maddening.
Here we have this astounding creature with his vast potential for fabulous knowledge to be given us, and we may only stand and stare at each other.
Lawrence.
Elliot.
[Alien noise pulses]
Oh, I'm getting primitive in my excitement.
It's foolish of me.
What about sign language?
Shall I try it?
Just don't alarm him.
It's no use.
Start backing up.
If he makes a move for that thing in his holster, stop.
All right.
Back up.
[Pulses]
All right now.
On the double.
[Coughs]
[Coughs]
What's the matter?
[Coughs]
Father!
I'm all right.
[Coughs]
John, where have you been? I've been so...
Behind you.
[Alien noise pulses]
[Lawrence]
Any luck?
[Elliot]
Nothing works.
He just keeps making that sound to everything we try to do.
How is enid? Did the sedative work?
Yeah, she's asleep now.
Good.
[Elliot] We've got to reach him.
You've found a means of communication, doctor?
Yes.
What?
A common denominator,
Professor.
The basic and universal language:
Geometry.
By George, doctor!
You've hit it!
If anything should warrant success, this should.
Excuse me, Professor.
You've lost me.
I'm the shadowy figure in the background with a stupid look on his face.
I don't get this math.
There may be no scientific achievement without math.
In itself, it's the purest language of science.
Now this creature represents an obviously superior race of beings where science is concerned.
To be able to land on the earth from a planet whose existence was previously unsuspected.
I'm up to you now.
If there's anything our friend should understand, and we might use as a bridge to reach him, it's this same basic language: Geometry.
Precisely.
Professor, this is not an easy formula to devise.
Would you...
I understand.
You need undisturbed concentration.
Let us know when you're ready.
Come, John.
You're leaving him alone with...
I presume your concern arises from fears for my safety, Mr. Lawrence.
Spare yourself any anxiety.
This creature is as intelligent as we.
He knows that we are trying to find a mutual basis for understanding.
I'm quite safe.
Mears is right.
Come, John.
[Pulses]
I'll have the world in my pocket with your help.
[Humming and pulsing]
Now don't start fussing about me like that, my dear.
I have a little touch of the flu.
It's nothing to get nervous about.
You're going to stay in bed.
Here's a compromise.
Suppose I go to the village to the drugstore and buy medicine that will alleviate the...
"chemist" in england.
Chemist or drugstore,
I'll get something that'll knock this out.
You stay in bed till I get back.
Oh, that creature downstairs...
Don't worry about him.
I'll take a look at him.
I don't like leaving you here with...
I'll return as fast as I can.
Here are the car keys.
If you fix the tire, it'll save you a lot of time.
All right.
Oh, and what have we here, now?
Oh, morning, constable.
Isn't that miss Elliot's car?
Yeah. I'm visiting her father.
So you're the man from America.
Yup.
Folks be saying all's not well up to the Brock.
They're absolutely right.
Strange doings at all times of the night.
Naturally.
Excuse me.
Aye.
Naturally, you're saying.
Yup. Professor Elliot has a touch of the flu.
Oh, so,
'tis true.
As a matter of fact,
I'm on my way in now to the chemist to get some medicine.
Aye.
If you'll excuse me.
Aye.
This shall be my secret.
[Hums and pulses]
Oh.
Heh heh heh heh.
To think, a fantastic gnome like you had to hurtle out of space to put this power into my hands.
Well, now that we've made contact,
I'm going to tear out every secret you've got.
[Pulses and hums loudly]
[Humming ends]
We're gonna ration this, and you're gonna start earning it.
[Enid] Dr. mears.
Dr. mears.
What is it?
Father would like to see you.
He's resting.
Were you able to communicate with him?
No.
It was a futile attempt.
I couldn't make him understand me at all.
I'm most disappointed.
I had high hopes.
Oh, I felt sure you were on the right track.
Well, we will have to try another method.
How are you feeling?
Everybody's so concerned about me.
May I trouble you for a glass of water, please?
Yes.
[Enid screams]
Got the stuff.
Should have you up around in no time.
Where's enid?
In the kitchen.
Enid.
Enid?
[Lawrence] Enid was gone.
Had I sacrificed her just for a newspaper story?
That was the thought which tormented me.
She's nowhere around.
The dungeon's empty.
Empty?
What happened after I left?
Enid! He must have taken her.
Come on.
Where to?
The sphere on the moor.
Where else would he take her?
You got a gun,
Professor?
I have one.
Well, bring it.
Be careful.
I'll go along...
Wait a minute,
Professor.
Be sensible.
You'd better stay in bed.
We'll go out and scout and be back as soon as we can.
Let's go.
The gun'sin my room.
I'll meet you out front.
What did he do to him?
He was trying to establish communication.
How? Oh, yes, I know geometrically, but how else?
What do you mean?
Did he abuse him?
Provoke him in any way?
There wouldn't have been any sense in doing so.
Well, I don't consider mears a sensible man.
He's an ambitious man, a brilliant man, a dishonest man, but not a sensible one.
But why should he be foolish as to try to jeopardize...
Well, he mayhave to answer for that one of these days. Here.
Directions are on the bottle.
You'd better take it, and stay in bed.
Anything?
Not a sign. Nothing.
We can't risk a move.
Enid might be in there.
What'd you do to him back there in the dungeon?
Do to him?
I didn't do anything.
Nothing at all.
He showed a definite disposition toward friendliness when I left.
Well, how can you talk of him as if he were a human being?
How do we know what thought processes run through his head?
How can we even assume that he thinks like we do?
How can you anticipate what a fantastic organism like that might do or might not do?
All right.
Stay here and
I'll be back.
If anything should happen to enid
I'll never forgive myself.
I should never have exposed her to this danger.
Should never have exposed her.
[Lawrence] The night was haunted by terror and the sickening conviction that the man from planet x had enid powerless in his grasp.
If she was to be saved,
I had to think calmly.
I checked off my resources.
Help from the village?
I dared not risk it with enid a captive.
The Professor?
Ill. Helpless.
Dr. mears?
Unstable. Unpredictable.
If I only were not so helpless before the voiceless threat of the unknown.
Where was enid?
And where was the man from planet x?
[Footsteps]
Good evening to you, sir.
Good heavens, men.
Don't you knock?
I thought you heard us coming upthe stairs.
No, I didn't.
I didn't mean to frighten you, sir.
What brings you here?
We'd like to speak with the Professor.
He's sick.
He's on a sedative.
What do you want with him?
'Tis a matter of considerable importance.
Sandy burns and
Mike Lane have gone.
Gone?
Where? Why?
Plain vanished and none can tell where.
I don't get you.
Gordy and me, we've been out on the moors searching for them.
We dropped by here to look in on you.
You don't think
I have your
2 villagers up here?
Each night they drive the sheep in from the moors.
Last night they did not come home.
The two of them.
And what we want to know is it any of your doing here at the Brock?
Up here?
You'll not deny there's something very strange going on here.
No, I won't deny it.
Something strange has been going on.
Boogey doings.
Aye, aye.
And now, what exactly is the natureof this...
Miss Elliot has disappeared.
Aye, miss...
Oh, no.
She has, now?
Have you any idea as to where she could be?
Yes, I have, but I can't tell you.
And why not?
You wouldn't believe me.
I'll have to show you.
Aye, show me, is it?
I'll try to explain on the way if your friend will stay with the Professor while we're gone.
Well, all right.
But there'd best be no monkey business of a foreign nature.
I'll go with you, and, gordy aye, Tammy?
If I'm not back in a reasonable time, call outthe village.
Aye.
Boogey's work.
I'll not believe such clapper-claw...
That's why I'm going to show you.
It's that sphere which brought him out of space.
It's just over the next rise.
Aye, it's daft you are completely flummoxed.
Or it is some
American joke.
Look, I don't enjoy walking out on these cold moors.
Professor Elliot hasn't been living in that Brock because he likes it, and his daughter hasn't disappeared as a joke.
Aye.
You make it sound very sober.
'Tis a sorry part of the moors for honest men to be in.
Come on, easy.
It's right ahead, now.
[Constable]
I don't see a thing.
But this is the spot where I left mears just a few hours ago.
You don't tell me he's gone away, too.
Mears?
Mears?
[Dog howls]
Give me a light.
Aye.
I don't see a thing.
There, there.
You see where the brush is flattened?
What's this?
Mears' binoculars.
Ach, man, it must be you've been sampling too much of our good scot whisky.
Finding glasses doesn't mean much.
What about your
2 villagers who've disappeared and miss Elliot and now mears?
Believe me, man, we're in trouble.
We'll go back to the station house.
I'll get out a search party.
Meanwhile I'll keep me eyes on you.
I don't care where you look, provided you do something.
Now, go along with you.
Tammy, have you found my man?
[Andre] Was out on the moor gave you any clue, constable?
Nay, not.
We have not found a thing.
But 2 more persons are missing.
One is the old
Professor's daughter, and the other is one of the men staying up to the Brock.
Now, don't you worry.
We'll find him for you.
Donald.
Aye?
Go up one side of the village.
Knock on the doors.
Andre, you go up the other side.
We'll search the moor.
It will take every man.
Tell the men to bring what arms they have.
Andre, Donald, you hear that?
Get on with you, then.
Gordy! What ails you, man?
Act like you've seen a ghost or something.
A ghost? No.
Something of flesh and blood yet of neither.
Horrible, monstrous creature with a head as big as two men put together, and skin with the shine of a new shilling, and eyes that are no better than a dead fish.
Where'd you see him?
Why'd you leave the Professor?
I didn't.
He left me.
What are you saying?
I went to fill the water jug at the well.
When I was coming back, the Professor was walking into the fog with his friend who's been with him.
Dr. mears?
That's him.
I heard him call by name.
What happened?
The Professor's ill.
The other one was helping him.
And he looked no better than a dead man himself, with his glassy eyes.
I was afraid, and I followed them.
And then, then it was I saw it.
It? It what, man?
The boogey.
Boogey?
With a big head and a hump in his back.
He stepped out of the fog a wee bit before the Professor and his friend,
I did not wait to see what else happened.
I ran until I thought my heart would burst from my chest.
All right. Get back, now, get back.
Well, Mr. Lawrence what do you make of that?
It's that creature from outer space.
He's got mears in his clutches and used him to get the Professor too.
That's where you'll find the men from the village, too.
[Andre] Man from space?
What clapper-claw is this?
'Tis a fearsome visitor from another world.
Is it complete daft you are, constable?
'Tis why the Professor has been living up at the Brock.
To see what would happen when an unknown planet came close to the earth on the night of the 17th.
That's a few days from now.
But why here in burry?
The Professor's calculations told him this is the area of closest contact with the planet.
[Woman]
But the boogey
'tis real, then?
We have every reason to believe it is.
The Lasses and the children stay behind locked doors!
You men!
It will be all over town in no time.
We've got to get out on the moors.
You could not get a loon out there.
We'll get help from the outside.
Got a radio?
I mean a wireless?
Not for outside contact.
Call London, tell them what's happened here, and ask for help at once.
Hello?
Are you there?
Hello!
Hello, there!
It's dead.
Here, let me try.
Hello, operator?
Operator.
Hello, hello.
Have you had this trouble before?
Only during climate disturbances.
There's no local exchange here?
It's over on the mainland.
The wire goes across the bottom of the sea.
Well, except for the fog, the weather isn't too bad.
Aye, I can't understand it.
Lend me your bicycle and I'll go to the Brock.
Maybe I'll find something that...
Who knows?
Fine risk you'd be running.
It's better than hanging around here, just waiting.
The bicycle's outside.
Thanks.
I'll be back in a few hours.
You hang on that phone.
Aye.
Hello?
These two must have undergone the same treatment.
You mean they were acting independent of their own will?
They were acting like slaves, and seeking villagers to be enslaved with them.
But for what?
Can't you see?
He's building an army.
If he isn't stopped, he'll have every man in this village to carry out his orders.
You take the taste of the tea right out of my mouth.
Any luck with the phone?
Nothing but jangling clanging and buzzing.
Is there a way we can get word off this island?
No, no, no. Except what? What?
Well, talk, man!
I was thinking perhaps heliograph.
Well, try it at once!
But there's not enough sunlight to get to the nearest place.
[Ship whistle blows]
There's enough to reach that boat out there.
Hey, right you are!
Fast, fast, before it sails by.
Right-o.
She'll be nosing into that fog bank in a few minutes.
Aye.
[Whistle blows]
Emergency.
Village terror-stricken.
Contact Scotland yard.
Well, she's gone.
Aye.
Fog bank swallowed her up.
Think they saw us?
I cannot tell.
And what are you lads doing out this time of...
Oh, look here, lads!
Let me go! This is no time for pranks!
[Continues shouting]
And I found it at the new location, where he'd moved it.
It was being fortified, and I have no doubt that the men doing the job were the same ones who disappeared from the village but I was too far away to recognize them.
And I have some news for you, too.
Two more of the men of the village have been taken.
How'd that happen?
Young wilke and Bobby Harris.
Young wilke went down to look at his cows.
They hadn't been milked for 2 days.
His sister said he left a little before sunrise.
He didn't return.
Bobby went down to look at his boat, to see if it were up above the midnight tide line.
He didn't return, neither.
If the men left don't buckle down, this will be a village of zombies.
You can not get them out.
It's the fear of the unknown that scared them.
Even if they would take the risk, their Lasses wouldn't let them.
What should we do?
Stand around and let him send for us?
[Knock on door]
Come.
Come in.
Gentlemen.
Who are you?
Are you in charge of this station, constable?
Aye.
I'm inspector Porter.
This is sergeant Ferris.
Scotland yard?
Yes.
Gentlemen, pardon me.
Come in, inspector come in. Sit down.
We were in Edinburgh.
We received word from London...
Our message got through!
The ship saw us!
Aye.
I understand a freight ship relayed to London by a wireless a message he picked up while passing that was flashed by heliograph.
I'm John Lawrence.
Oh. American?
Newspaperman.
Affiliated press.
How'd you get here?
Small plane.
Landed South of the village.
Only field without boulders.
Took us an hour to trudge here.
You're a long way from home, Mr. Lawrence.
What are you doing here in burry?
Sit down, inspector.
I'll try to tell you.
How do you expect to cope with this situation, inspector?
Well, from what
I've been told,
I see only one way.
A detachment of the military.
That creature won't be taken.
He'll fight and all those people he's captured will die with him.
How will you get soldiers here?
The telephone's out.
Our plane has a wireless.
There just might be another way.
Oh? What's that?
It's now 9:30.
I'll give you until 11:00 to try what you can.
If you're not back by then, we'll open fire.
But you've got to at least give us time.
By that time, your job must be finished.
If it isn't
Everyone out there might be annihilated...
Enid, the Professor, people from the village,
Dr. mears...
Everyone.
Professor Elliot told you that planet would be within the earth's gravitational orbit by midnight.
The result of such an unique proximity could be...
Anything.
None of us know what that enigma out on the moors might be planning.
Aye, you're right, inspector.
The Professor's theory was invasion.
We can't risk determining whether it has an effect.
A planet of such size coming so close to ours might cause a disastrous atmospheric upheaval.
Therefore,
Mr. Lawrence, 11:00.
We dare not delay beyond that time.
Do you understand?
Yeah.
We may be risking too much.
All right.
The hour is near, and the man from planet x is waiting.
Be sure who's coming out of the fog before you start blasting, inspector.
I'll make certain.
I've written a story of what's happened here up to this minute.
Can I count on you to get it to the right hands when security seems fit?
I'll see that it reaches the proper hands.
Thanks.
Well...
Good luck.
Look out for yourself.
Yeah, thanks.
[Buzzing sound]
Professor Elliot.
Professor Elliot, this is John.
John Lawrence.
Do you hear me?
[Emotionless]
I hear you.
Where's enid?
Where's enid?
Inside.
What did mears tell you when he came back to the Brock?
Told me enid had escaped and sent for me.
Listen to me,
Professor.
Climb over this embankment...
Very quietly...
And walk straight ahead.
Climb over this embankment.
Walk straight ahead.
Mears.
Dr. mears.
Come here.
Kneel down.
You were able to communicate with thecreature, right?
Yes.
You found out how to do it in the dungeon at the Brock.
Is that so?
Yes.
What's he doing now?
What's his appearance here mean?
He's establishing a wireless directional beam to his planet.
At midnight, when the planet is at its closest approach to earth, an invasion will be launched.
But why? Why?
He comes from a planet that's dying.
It's turning to ice.
If his people do not escape from the planet before it swings back along its route through space, they will be doomed.
How'd they get so close to earth?
They managed to make the planet deviate from its natural orbit by scientific degravitation.
What was that object enid and I found on the moors?
It was a magnetically powered range finder, used to determine the composition of the earth's atmosphere.
It was sent out in advance of the spaceship for experimental purposes.
And how does he keep you a slave to his will?
By exposing us to a ray.
He exposes us to it every few hours.
Wait here.
Men.
Stop work.
Walk straight ahead.
Walk.
[High-pitched humming]
Enid! Enid!
Come out of there.
Mears, stand up.
Up!
Run!
Over this wall.
Come down.
Darling, it's me.
John.
Come on, we must hurry.
There's something out there.
It's the Professor!
Ah, it's glad I am to see you, sir.
Glad I am, indeed.
Where are you going?
Stop now.
Ferris, help him sit down.
Come along,
Professor.
Come along.
That's it, man.
Sit down here.
That's right,
Professor.
[Explosion]
[John]
Keep going!
No, they can't destroy him.
They mustn't.
[Explosion]
Mears!
Come back!
[Man] Fire!
Fools.
The planet!
You're going back with inspector Porter in his plane, hmm?
Yep. By this time tomorrow afternoon, we'll be...
Far out over the ocean.
Going home.
Mm-hmm.
I'll miss you.
Your father tells me you're coming to California so he can confer with Dr. blane.
Mm-hmm.
Soon.
Good.
Is it true that no one will ever know what happened here?
Knowledge would only bring more fear, in a world already filled with it.
Can such a thing be kept a secret?
No, but it can be reduced to gossip.
You know,
I think that creature was friendly.
I wonder what would have happened if Dr. mears hadn't frightened him?
Who knows?
Perhaps the greatest curse to ever befall the world, or perhaps the greatest blessing.
Hello, Matthew, what are you doing here so late?
I came to get the books.
I want to study our accounts.
We've been doing very well lately.
Over 200 paid admissions today.
You call that good Saturday business?
If you weren't so stubborn, we'd be turning them away from here.
Who cares a hang about history in wax?
There are people in the world who love beauty.
But more who want sensation, shock!
Morbidly curious! I won't cater to them.
Their money is as good as anybody else's.
You should have seen them turning them away at that Wax Museum on...
... 23rd Street tonight: The Eden Musée.
The story's the same at
Madame Tussaud's in London.
- If you'd only listened to me...
- I know, Matthew.
I'd put in a Chamber of Horrors:
Murder, torture, executions... scare the life out of people.
I don't care for that kind of patronage!
You're a great artist, a genius sculptor.
I'm an ordinary businessman who wants a quick return on his investment.
I've put $20,000 in this historic peep show of yours.
- I could use that to better advantage.
- All right, Matthew.
I've known for some time you wanted to dissolve our partnership.
- I may be able to accommodate you.
- How?
A friend is bringing Sidney Wallace, the art critic, to see my work tonight.
Wallace is rich, and I think
I might persuade him to buy you out.
That sounds interesting.
- I'll want a profit on my investment.
- Yes, Matthew.
I understand.
You leave everything to me, and I promise you it will be...
- That should be they, now.
- I'll wait in the office.
I've heard of Wallace.
He has a pot of money.
If he likes your stuff, put a stiff price on it.
- Does Jarrod live here?
- Yes, he has a room upstairs.
You'll like him, Sidney.
He speaks your language.
Please come in.
I'm happy to see you, Bruce.
I thought you wouldn't come on such a bad night.
We were delayed.
He had to be at a gallery.
Mr. Sidney Wallace. Professor Jarrod.
- A pleasure.
- For me also, Professor.
That title was bestowed on me when I became an exhibitor.
It has little to do with my real work.
If you come, I will show you what that work is.
The visit of such a distinguished critic... may cause my children to become conceited.
To you, they're wax. But to me, their creator, they live and breathe.
Here we have two great lovers from the past.
Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt, and Mark Antony. Their last meeting.
You'll recall, Antony, believing Cleopatra to be dead... killed himself with his own sword.
When Cleopatra found out what happened, she quickly followed her lover.
You noticed how cleverly the hair is mounted on the scalp?
Yes. How do you do that?
Real hair of the proper color and texture... is pressed into the slightly warmed wax with a scalpel... one hair at a time.
Each wave and curl of the subject's own hair is reproduced.
Here's President Lincoln and his assassin,
John Wilkes Booth... one of my few concessions to the macabre.
That's the best figure of Booth I've ever seen. You almost expect him to speak.
- I wonder what he'd say.
- I'm sure he'd rant a bit.
Even after he shot Lincoln and jumped from the President's box onto the stage... he couldn't resist turning to the audience and taking a bow.
I found him a very stubborn person.
- Stubborn?
- Unbelievably.
For days I argued with this fellow before he posed the way I wanted him to.
- You mean, he talked back to you?
- Of course.
It's not easy to shut an actor's mouth.
These groups are like dimensional paintings of the old masters.
This is not only a great show, it's an art exhibit.
That's what I told you.
Here we have Joan of Arc, a favorite subject of mine.
- I understand that. It's beautifully done.
- Thank you.
I've done her over a dozen times, and still she doesn't complain.
What was wrong with her?
There are no authentic portraits available... so sculptors and painters have to work from models.
I've never found the right one, but I will someday.
It's a shame to race through this exhibit.
These figures should be studied.
You're very kind.
My creations have some merit, I suspect... but in bringing back to life the lovely Marie Antoinette...
I feel I've done my best work.
I've never seen anything so exquisite.
People say they can see my Marie Antoinette breathe... that her breast rises and falls.
Look at her eyes, they follow you wherever you go.
She is very real to me.
You know, her eyes do follow you.
They're made of glass, more's the pity.
The exact size and color of the original.
They're inserted into the sockets from inside... by way of the hollow neck, before the head is attached to the body.
Forgive me, my dear, for discussing your intimate secrets.
I'm sorry. I lose myself at times.
If people knew what you have inside these walls... you couldn't accommodate the crowds.
What you need here is exploitation, more advertising.
- That's what I've been telling him.
- My partner wouldn't agree.
He's not happy here.
He wants to invest in something else.
Would you become a partner in this venture? Would you buy him out?
I might be interested if my lawyers approve and the price is right.
With your support, I'd do wonders.
I'd make any sacrifice.
Unfortunately, I'm leaving for Egypt.
I'm financing some excavations there.
I'll be back in three months, then we can discuss...
You make me very happy.
You intrigue me, Professor.
I believe we'd get along together.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- And I'm grateful to you...
- It's all right.
Thank you for your visit and your encouragement.
I'll see you in three months.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Mr. Wallace is a great art critic, darling.
You heard what he said.
Does he make you happy?
Of course you'd say that.
But I don't care about success.
The world will acknowledge your beauty.
And you, my friends...
Cleopatra, Mark Antony,
Lincoln, Joan of Arc, all of you.
How would it suit you to be famous again?
I know it'll please you, you conceited devil.
It was like you to get yourself shot down in a burning barn.
Couldn't do it without a spotlight, could you?
Do you really hear what they say?
Of course.
A man has to be a little nuts to be a good showman.
The sooner I'm out of it, the better.
You'll be out soon, Matthew.
Mr. Wallace returns from Egypt in three months.
He'll be ready to talk business then.
- I heard him. That's no good for me.
- But, surely...
I want to buy something. It'll pay off in a big way and three months is too late.
What guarantee do I have that he won't go cold on the deal?
- Sorry. It's the best I could do.
- I can do better.
How would you like to split $25,000 with me?
And you call me crazy?
You ever thought of what would happen if we had a fire here?
In the cellar, there are six barrels of wax.
Wax is paraffin based.
It's highly inflammable.
This place would go up like a paint factory.
Burn? Burn all my people?
- Do you think I'm a murderer?
- Stop dreaming.
These dummies are insured for $25,000.
That's $12,500 for each of us.
You'd have money to begin again.
I'd rather die myself than see my friends destroyed.
I won't let you do it, and I'll kill you if you try.
Don't be stupid.
All you have to do is to strike a match and the thing is done.
Yes, my friend was a genius.
A great artist.
Only I could understand him.
We were like that, Cathy. Just like that.
- Couldn't they ever find him after the fire?
- Not a sign of him.
The place burned like a paint factory.
Like a volcano.
He was such an impractical fellow.
But I still loved him.
Had I been there, I might have saved him.
You might have gotten burned yourself.
Yes. Such is life.
No matter how much we lose, we must still go on living.
Was there any insurance on the Wax Museum?
Yes. I had a little difficulty about that.
According to the partnership agreement... the money was to go to the survivor of the others.
The insurance company insists upon proof of my partner's death.
They always want a corpse.
But they settled finally.
This afternoon, in fact.
Certified check. I got it cashed.
The money is in my safe.
- You know what that means, baby?
- No, what?
That little trip
I was talking to you about...
You're such a card!
- How much did you get?
Where would you like to go? Atlantic City?
Niagara Falls.
We can get the license in Buffalo.
- License?
- Yes. You know.
Legitimate.
Why not? It might be fun.
Waiter, my check.
Pull it tighter, Sue.
I want a waist like Anna Held.
If I pull it any tighter, you're not going to be able to breathe.
That's all right.
I don't need much breath, anyway.
As my late friend Matty used to say:
"If a girl don't watch her figure, the men won't."
Wasn't that the man you were to marry?
Yes, but he hung himself instead.
Matty was such a card.
Where is your new friend gonna take you tonight?
The Hoffman House for dinner, and then to a vaudeville show.
- That sounds like fun.
- He's a free spender, all right.
Little bit older than I like 'em, but very distinguished looking.
- Is he nice?
- Awfully nice.
A real gentleman, except when he has had a couple of drinks.
That's to be expected.
I'm moving up.
I'm moving up in the world, honey.
No girl ever hits the jackpot till after she passes 14th Street.
- Is that how it goes?
- Sure.
Look at me.
Not too long ago,
I was down on Delancey Street.
And tonight I'll be right up there among the bright lights on 23rd.
Now, when you get up there tonight, don't drink too much.
Don't worry, I won't.
He keeps trying to pour the liquor into me, but I always manage to keep my head.
After all, now that I'm going regular with a swell...
I got social obligations.
You know how it is when a fella...
No, of course you don't know.
You're not like me. You never could be.
You got all the brains and all I've got is what I've got.
You know, I'm surprised you even talk to me.
What nonsense.
You've been so good to me.
Why not?
A girl needs a friend when she is down on her luck.
Holy smoke! Look at the time.
I've got to hurry.
Did you find a job yet?
No, but they need a hat-check girl at the Silver Slipper... and I've got an appointment with the manager.
I know that fellow. Watch out for him.
- But why? What's the matter with him?
- Nothing much.
- Long as you know how to duck.
- That kind?
Yes.
- Did you eat today?
- I had everything I needed.
To hear you tell it.
- Besides, you're behind in your room rent.
- Mrs. Flannigan will wait for me.
Don't count on that.
The old buzzard almost locked me out once.
There.
If I don't sizzle him tonight,
I might as well give up.
He's picking me up in a hansom cab.
No trolley for him. He is real society.
All I've got is 50 cents.
Buy some dinner with it.
- No, Cathy.
- Come on.
My friend will give me some money tonight and then I'll stake you.
I don't need any mad money.
I never get mad.
Good luck tonight at the Silver Slipper.
And don't forget to duck.
Just a moment, Miss Allen.
- What are you coming in so quietly for?
- I didn't want to disturb anybody.
- Did you get the job?
- No.
- Why not?
- I had trouble with the boss.
You'll get your money.
Cathy promised to lend me some tonight when she comes home.
You better get right up there, then.
Because she's home now.
- Couldn't it wait until tomorrow?
- No, it could not.
If you want to sleep in this house tonight, you get that money.
All right, I'll try.
Cathy, it's Sue. Are you there?
I tell you, the scream came from up there.
Let's look into it.
- Usually there's a policeman at the corner.
- That's why I'm blowing the whistle.
Cabbie!
- What is it, Mother?
- It's Sue.
This is a surprise.
I was just thinking about...
- What happened to you, dear?
- What's wrong?
- Wait a minute.
- What happened?
- Wait a minute.
- What is it?
Cathy Gray, the girl in my rooming house, was murdered tonight.
- What?
- I found her.
The man who killed her was there in the room.
I tried to get away from him.
But he followed me into the street.
No, Scott, please don't go out there.
It's all right, darling. Don't be frightened.
It's all right now, dear. You're safe.
- Who found the body?
- One of my roomers. A friend of Cathy's.
- Sue Allen.
- Which one is Miss Allen?
- She isn't here.
- Where is she?
I don't know. We heard her scream.
When we went looking for her, she was gone.
- Are all your roomers in?
- All but Miss Allen.
Lt. Brennan will want a statement from each one of you.
See that nobody leaves the house.
When I arrived at the rooming house, this girl had been dead for several hours.
The immediate cause of death was strangulation.
The mark of a cord is still on her throat.
My examination indicated she'd probably been given a drug.
- You were right.
- What was it?
Something to make her sleep.
Veronal, perhaps.
I'll know as soon as we hear from the laboratory.
How long would it take for such a drug to work?
That would depend upon how much it was diluted.
It was probably given to her in a drink.
That's how it's usually done.
- Business is slow tonight.
- What?
- Three suicides and two murders...
- And a traffic case since 9:00.
The fellow got hit by an automobile.
I didn't think they go fast enough to hurt anybody.
Give them time.
They're getting better every day.
I hope you like it here, honey.
It's the best we've got.
- What's the matter with this one?
- You'll get used to that.
The embalming fluid makes them jump.
One of the suicides. Just like a woman.
They always have to have the last word.
- Why didn't you tell the police?
- She's doing that.
Last night was the time to do it.
- She was in no condition to come here.
- This is murder, Mrs. Andrews.
The body of Cathy Gray was stolen from the morgue last night.
No.
Why would anyone want to take Cathy's body?
We are as much in the dark as you are.
We had a similar case before.
Matthew Burke.
I read about that.
And Patterson, a Deputy City Attorney disappeared.
We found no trace of him.
We could've laid our hands on that man that you saw last night.
That's the strangest description
I've ever heard.
- No human being can look like that.
- Sure you didn't imagine it?
I did see him.
Just as I described him to you.
He was incredible, but very real.
Could he be the man who took Miss Gray to dinner?
That's impossible.
She told me that he was very good-looking.
That's what the landlady said, it's a man with gray hair.
We have no suspects fitting your description.
If we did, we'd have him in the crazy house.
Don't leave town. Where can we find you?
27 Lafayette Street.
- Miss Allen will stay in our home.
- Make sure of that. She's our only witness.
That's all. Thank you.
How do you do?
I received a letter giving this address and signed Professor Jarrod.
But I know the Professor's dead.
Can you tell me who wrote this letter?
My name is Sidney Wallace.
It's so good...
Forgive me. Shaking hands with me is an unpleasant experience.
My hands are no longer hands.
Sit down, please.
This is Igor. He's a deaf-mute.
He is one of my assistants.
I'm going to open another wax museum under a different name.
- It startled you, seeing me here?
- I thought you were dead.
Jarrod is dead. I am a reincarnation.
When I saw your signature,
I thought somebody was fooling me.
I don't understand how you escaped the fire.
It's a mystery to me, too.
All I can remember is that I tried to get out of my studio.
- I failed at first, but here I am.
- What a frightful experience.
Somehow I made my way to the house of a doctor.
I still have my limbs but they won't bear the weight of my body.
As for my hands, they are no use to me now.
As a sculptor, I can't control them.
But they serve for ordinary functions.
- But you're beginning again?
- With the help of my pupils, yes.
I'm rebuilding my exhibition from the ground up.
I'm going to give the people what they want:
Sensation, horror, shock.
Send them out in the streets to tell their friends... how wonderful it is to be scared to death.
I'll show you one of my subjects.
Do you recall the case of Kemmler, the first man to die in the electric chair?
- Yes.
- Igor is working on a model of his head.
He has a strange obsession, this mute of mine.
Every head he models takes on the shape of his own face.
But in this case I humor him, for he somewhat resembles Kemmler.
Crimes of violence will be reproduced in wax... and exhibited while they are still fresh in the public mind.
What do you think of my scheme?
It will succeed, commercially, though it doesn't sound like you.
- Have you turned your back on beauty?
- No.
But I can no longer create it.
- I never forgot your Marie Antoinette.
- Nor have I.
She will be the leading lady of my new exhibition.
But I must find her first.
- Find her?
- A model, I mean.
Yes, there will be beauty, for contrast, if nothing else.
But each subject must be taken from life.
How can I convince my audience they're alive, if I don't believe it myself?
I have something I think will interest you.
You follow Igor down into the basement.
I have to go my own way.
Here we are. Interesting, isn't it?
One of my pupils is about to dip a body into a bath of wax.
- Body?
- Yes.
The bodies are constructed separately... to exact specifications, of reinforced plaster of Paris.
This is Leon, another one of my pupils.
- Mr. Wallace.
- How do you do?
The wax is melted in the cauldron you see above the vat... liquefied and brought to a boiling point... so that it will distribute itself evenly over the body.
The head and hands, tinted by my own secret process... are attached to the body after it is covered with its skin of wax.
Now watch.
I wondered how it was done.
It's a method of my own.
Crude but adequate.
- Have you found a home for your museum?
- This is it, the building upstairs.
We'll continue to use the cellar as the workshop... it's an excellent location, and the building can be leased at the right price.
I have some capital, but I need more.
$30,000, at least.
That's why I've asked you to come here.
- I'll think it over.
- Good.
She is about right, now.
Leon, drain out the surplus, and let her cool.
Leon, open up number 27.
Come this way, please.
I told you that I intend to exhibit scenes of violence.
Here is an interesting subject.
A mystery they are still talking about.
All right, Leon.
I saw his picture in the papers.
This is a remarkable likeness.
- But it can't be a death mask.
- No, it's from memory.
He hanged himself in an elevator shaft.
Come in, ladies and gentlemen.
See the House of Wax.
See the Chamber of Horrors.
Here's three lovely ladies right over here.
Would you like to see Little Egypt?
Here she is, ladies and gentlemen,
Little Egypt, Queen of the Harem... who danced at the Colombian Exposition in Chicago in 1893.
Is she wax, or is she flesh and blood?
See the world in wax, the Hall of Fame.
The Chamber Of Horrors.
A cultural exhibition that'll enlighten you, amaze you...
- I think I could do that.
- No, you couldn't.
I could, too, if I took my stays off.
Don't do that. Don't talk that way.
Watch it, young lady.
Careful, sir. Keep your head down or I'll tap you on the chin.
Look out.
That's a becoming hat you're wearing.
I wonder if I could clip a flower off it.
Hold steady, now. Don't move your head.
Or you'll lose the powder off your nose.
There is someone with a bag of popcorn.
Close your mouth, it's the bag I'm aiming at.
Not your tonsil. Here she comes.
Look at that, it's in the bag.
See the lovely centers of ancient times, ladies and gentlemen.
Beauties who died and tortured out on the block.
Visit our Chamber of Horrors.
And pass the time of day with notorious murderers... who killed with the rope, the knife, and the axe.
Thrills, chills, a lot of dirt for a price within the reach of all.
I hope you don't think I've gone too far hiring this fellow to bring people in.
- He makes it sound like a sideshow.
- Try him for a week or two.
Once we're established, we won't need that sort of thing.
He looks like a real man.
You'd be surprised.
It's a real man. Sorry.
The historic figures I'm about to show you will be more interesting... when I tell you that their faces were molded from the original death masks... now in the possession of certain European governments.
First, we have Anne Boleyn... second wife of Henry the Vlll, and the mother of Queen Elizabeth.
With the executioner
Henry borrowed from the French king... so that Anne's head would be cleaved from her body without too much pain.
He was a thoughtful husband, Henry.
It was he who invented the short cut to divorce.
A very bad pun, I'm afraid.
Here is another scene of historic violence.
Charlotte Corday and Marat... one of the leaders of the French Revolution.
The lady found him taking a bath, and plunged the knife into his heart.
- Quelle femme terrible!
- What a shocking thing.
Yes, wasn't it? The poor man was dreadfully embarrassed.
The exhibits in this room will be added to... from time to time as various crimes are committed.
You'll read about them in your newspaper... and see them enacted here in waxen tableaux.
By the way, ladies... this is how your ancestor carried his bride across the threshold.
During the French Revolution... a certain doctor invented a labor-saving device... to take the place of a headmen's ax.
So successful was this machine... at cutting off the heads of the French aristocrats... they named it after its creator.
Here it is, the bloody guillotine.
I don't think I can stand it.
Pull yourself together.
Twelve years ago, the electric chair was first used in New York state.
Here we have an authentic reproduction... of the execution of William Kemmler on August 3, in 1890.
Kemmler killed without mercy and 2,000 volts sent him to a higher court.
The torture of the rack. In this case...
Lady Anne Askew, an English noblewoman accused of treason... is being put to the question.
Needless to say, she admitted she was a traitor.
Who wouldn't, under that sort of pressure?
- Is it your corset?
- It's my stomach. It turned over.
Mine turned over, too.
Now, my friends... we have that jolly old gentleman known as the modern Bluebeard.
Like his namesake, he killed not wisely, but too well... and did away with eight wives.
- Smelling salts, ladies? Help yourself.
- Thank you very much.
Next door to him, we have a mystery of more recent date.
Matthew Burke, the stockbroker.
He was found hanged in the elevator shaft of the building where he had his offices.
Was it murder or suicide?
Only time will tell.
"Foul deeds will rise, though all the world o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes."
Thank you.
- You like him?
- He looks exactly like my Uncle Rufus.
They ought to have a policeman like this in the Eden Musée.
- Haven't you been there?
- No.
From what I see in the papers, this museum is even better.
We'll soon find out.
Meet my good friend, Mr. Sidney Wallace.
- Miss Sue Allen.
- A pleasure.
- I heard you were in town.
- You should have looked me up.
I expect great things of Scott.
He's one of our most promising sculptors.
- Has he been working hard?
- He never knows when to stop.
- Sue's been posing for me.
- Indeed, lovely subject.
She's not a professional model.
She's a guest.
Our mothers were great friends.
- Have you been inside?
- Is it exciting?
If anything, too much so.
But I'm sure it'll catch on.
Jarrod, the owner, is a good friend of mine.
You'll be interested in him.
Let's go in, shall we?
- These figures are excellent.
- I thought you'd agree with me.
They're not only well done but they're good theater.
- What do you think?
- I know they are only wax... but they seem so real, just looking at her makes my neck hurt.
Wait till you see the Chamber of Horrors.
I told Jarrod he should have a nurse on duty there.
He lost the use of his hands.
- Who did these figures?
- His pupils, but he supervised the work.
- His is the mastermind.
- Surely knows his anatomy.
Sue, what is it?
- Are you crying?
- What's wrong, Miss Allen?
A dear friend of mine was murdered and I found her.
She means Cathy Gray, the girl whose body was stolen from the morgue.
What made you think of her now?
That's her face. I know every line of it.
I wake up at night and I see it.
I can't get it out of my mind.
Perhaps that's the reason you see a resemblance.
- It's more than a resemblance.
- It's wax, my dear.
I know, but...
But why should it be so like Cathy?
I think I can explain that.
- This is a pleasure.
- You see, Miss Allen...
I heard what the young lady said.
The figure of Joan of Arc is a traditional exhibit in wax museums.
It was completed just in time for our opening tonight.
You're right, my dear.
It is more than a chance resemblance.
When I create an important figure,
I can't take just any face.
I saw pictures of your Cathy Gray in the newspaper.
Her face fascinated me. And here she is.
Immortalized as the victim of an earlier event.
- Do you really think she'd mind?
- No, I don't think she'd mind.
Cathy loved to "dress up" as she called it.
She used to take fancy dresses... and imitate the actresses she saw in the theater.
- I don't think she'd mind.
- Then I'm forgiven?
There's nothing to forgive.
I just don't understand how it can seem so real.
That's the finest compliment
I have ever received. Thank you, my dear.
Did I hear your name correctly,
Scott Andrews?
- Yes, Mr. Jarrod.
- The sculptor I've been telling you about.
Sidney showed me photographs of your work.
He was right. You have great promise.
- What are you doing now?
- I'm doing a head of Miss Allen.
Let me see your hands.
Mine were once like that.
How I envy you.
Would you be interested in some modeling for me, some originals I have in mind?
Yes. I'd be honored.
Good. Come here tomorrow morning, we'll make the arrangements.
I think you'll like it.
I want you to look at this girl.
- With pleasure.
- Who does she remind you of?
I've been wondering about that.
I haven't known her more than 10 minutes but...
... there's something about her face...
That haunts you as the face of my Marie Antoinette has haunted me.
Of course. I should have seen it at once.
- A figure in wax. Mr. Jarrod's greatest work.
- More than wax. She lived.
- You mean I look like she did?
- Exactly as she did.
Once in his lifetime, every artist feels the hand of God... and creates something that comes alive.
So it was with my Marie Antoinette.
And I loved her.
But she is gone now. Horribly destroyed.
Perhaps you would help me to bring her back.
You will come to see me? Soon?
I'd be glad to.
You'll be welcome at any time, no matter what I'm doing.
- And you, Mr. Andrews, in the morning...
- I'll be here, very eager to begin.
It has been a very exciting day for me and I'm a little tired.
So if you'll forgive me, I'll say good night.
Sidney, one moment, please.
Excuse me, I'll be right back.
Forget about it.
You heard what Mr. Jarrod said.
Cathy's face was inspiration.
It's a portrait in wax.
Why should it seem so real?
I hate to drag you away.
That's fine. I'm going to work here.
We'll see it all another time.
Yes, another time.
Still time to see the entire exhibition, ladies and gentlemen.
Get your tickets from the fine little lady in the box office and go right in.
See the world in wax and improve your mind.
See the Chamber of Horrors and scare yourself out of a year's growth.
Not again.
What happened? Why did you scream?
I saw Cathy again.
And the man who killed her was right here in this room.
I must have been dreaming.
Of course you were, dear.
A lager for the gentleman.
Sarsaparilla for the lady.
- And two knockwurst on rye.
- Thank you.
- Enjoying yourself?
- It's exciting.
- Do nice people come here?
- Of course.
- These Sunday matinees are very popular.
- I don't know.
It doesn't seem proper, all those girls showing their talents.
You never saw a show like this in Provincetown?
Don't worry, your reputation is safe.
You've been worrying too much... about wax figures and seeing monsters in your dreams.
You need something like this to bring you back to normalcy.
Prosit!
Remember Mr. Jarrod said he first saw
Cathy's picture in the newspaper.
Yes. What's wrong with that?
I knew her so well.
I knew every little expression and they are all there.
They would be. The man's an artist.
There's something else I saw that night in the museum.
Cathy had a habit of wearing an earring in her right ear.
She had the lobe of her right ear only pierced for that.
But that's there, too.
How could he see that in a photograph?
- How can he make it so real unless...
- What?
Unless it is Cathy.
I'm going to take you to Lt. Brennan's office tomorrow.
Tell him exactly what you told me here.
He's a policeman, he knows.
He'll convince you once and for all that no such thing could happen.
Now relax, honey, and enjoy the show.
I know it sounds fantastic, but you asked me to tell you everything.
You can see this idea is an obsession, an unhealthy one, if you ask me.
- You say Jarrod is a cripple?
- He uses a wheelchair.
He can walk with crutches, but not very well.
Such a man came and asked to see police photographs of Cathy Gray.
That's how it's done. Every detail is studied to make the features true to life.
But why should Joan of Arc have her right ear pierced?
- Why not? They wore them then.
- Two, not one.
Lieutenant, it's not a suspicion.
It's more a kind of fear, an intuition.
Intuition isn't much help in police work.
Facts are what we need.
Suppose you forget about it, and let us do the worrying.
You mean you'll investigate it?
- Of course he does.
- Yes, that's what I mean.
- You both think I'm crazy.
- We think nothing of the kind.
It was very good of you to listen and be so patient. Thank you.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Thanks.
This is Brennan speaking. Give me Shane.
Hello. I want you to go to the City License Bureau... and check up on a man named Henry Jarrod.
Yes, he opened a museum on 29th Street, near Broadway.
Yes, The House of Wax.
Dig up all you can. Get a list of his employees and check with me here.
That's a copy of her face, all right.
But she didn't look like that when I saw her.
- Not so composed.
- Poor kid.
You know, this fellow Jarrod's good.
- You think Miss Allen's fears are justified?
- Heck, no. Do you?
That's wax, how could it be anything else?
Leave it to a skirt to dream up a crazy idea like that.
So you did come to see me, my Marie Antoinette?
Or was it that you came to see?
Mr. Jarrod, I'm so sorry. I know
I'm not supposed to touch the figures.
You couldn't help yourself.
Don't let it trouble you.
I beg your pardon, this is Leon Averill and Igor.
- How do you do?
- Igor isn't impolite. He simply can't talk.
Leon is an artist in his own right.
It was he who did the waxwork on the figure of Joan of Arc.
- Does she still seem real to you?
- As life itself.
Of course, her hair is different, but that doesn't change her face.
What puzzles me is how you can get such detail from a photo.
Was Cathy wearing her earrings when the police photographed her?
Earrings? I don't remember.
Was she, Leon?
No. I don't think so.
The police would remove the jewelry from the body, wouldn't they?
Yet you were careful to show that both her ears had been pierced for them.
Yes, of course.
If I missed a detail of that sort,
Mr. Jarrod would be most displeased.
He insists on reality.
I can understand that.
Just a moment, Leon.
There's something in this box
I think would interest you. Open it, Leon.
Your Mr. Andrews permitted us to make a cast of the head he did of you.
Leon has just finished it in wax.
Do you like it?
It's sort of a shock to see your head detached that way.
- I guess it's a very good likeness.
- Yes, and no.
Andrews is clever, but like all modern sculptors... he has too much imagination.
He would improve on nature.
What I need for my Marie Antoinette is you.
The real you.
Nothing less will satisfy me.
Will you come to see me again, my dear?
You know this fellow Jarrod's quicker at finding these guys than we are?
That's what he says in his advertising.
Look at that. Even the twist in the neck.
That's a case that gets me.
Where is Burke? Who got him?
- Who'd want him?
- We better find out pretty quick.
- Did you read the blast in today's World?
- Yeah, it's dynamite.
The Chief had me in his office this morning.
If I'm not careful,
I'll be pounding a beat in the Bronx.
Come here, Jim.
Do you remember Patterson, the
Deputy City Attorney who disappeared?
Sure.
Does Booth look like Wilbur, or am I crazy?
He does a tad with the brush off his lip.
The hair is different, of course, but the features are like Patterson's.
Maybe he looked like Booth. I've seen dummies that look like people I know.
The caveman is a spitting image of the new Commissioner.
Please. Don't touch the exhibits.
- Can't you read the sign?
- I'm sorry.
Look, where'd you get the face for this guy that shot Lincoln?
- From photographs.
- They take them at that time?
If you go to the City Library... you'll find the volume of Mathew Brady's photos taken during the Civil War.
- Do you work here?
- Yeah.
- You make these things?
- Some of them.
What's your name?
Leon Averill. What's yours?
Jim Shane. I'm an engineer on the
9th Avenue El. It was nice meeting you.
You know me. I'm no good at names, but I don't forget faces.
If I can take the muff off of that one
I might be able to place it.
It was a long time ago.
Mr. Wallace, I'm Lt. Brennan. Sgt. Shane.
- Glad to know you.
- Won't you sit down?
- Sorry I kept you waiting.
- That's all right.
This is the first time I've been asked to come to Police Headquarters.
What am I suspected of?
Nothing. We thought perhaps you might be able to help us.
We heard that your partner is the same Professor Jarrod... whose museum on 24th Street burned down some time ago.
That's true.
This Professor Jarrod was supposed to have been killed in the fire.
- Apparently, a slight mistake.
- You suspect him of some criminal act?
- We haven't a thing on him.
- We're curious.
So is the insurance company.
What do you know about his employees?
- There's Scott Andrews, a protégé of mine.
- Yes, we know of him.
Then there's Igor, deaf-mute, and Leon Averill, who does the wax work.
Averill's an odd character.
Periodical drunkard, but a fine artist.
I've seen some of his sketches.
One of the Savior with his disciples.
Beautiful work.
- I'm afraid I haven't been much help.
- You never can tell. Thank you.
- Please don't mention this to your partner.
- I won't.
You know, I gamble on Jarrod.
He's strange, unpredictable, but I think he's a man of integrity.
- I'm sure of it. Thank you very much.
- Not at all. Good day, gentlemen.
Remember I told you
I knew the man with the whiskers?
Do you remember that artist in Sing Sing who painted The Last Supper on his cell?
Hendricks. They called him a genius and gave him a parole.
But when they turned him loose, he became a drunk.
He broke parole a year ago.
We've had him on the wanted list since.
- Carl Hendricks?
- That's him. Alias, Leon Averill.
- Bring him in.
- Can do.
A little more bitterness in that face, my boy.
Remember, this fellow has been badly used by the world... and he despises all the people in it.
Deepen those lines around the corner of the mouth.
Not too much.
There. That's better.
What I wouldn't give to have those fingers of yours.
- Thank you, Mr. Jarrod.
- I'm sorry I kept you so late tonight, Scott.
That's all right.
Miss Allen is meeting me here.
It's her birthday.
We're going to celebrate at Chiles'.
Charming creature.
I was worried. The shock of finding that murdered girl gave her strange ideas.
I know.
I took her to Lt. Brennan, he set her right.
That's very good now. Excellent.
Before you go, would you mind running over to Metzgers for me?
- Metzgers?
- Where they make the artificial flowers.
They're doing a background for this new group. Take a look at it.
You know what I want.
Advise them on the color scheme.
I'd go myself, but it's so hard for me to get about.
I know. I'll be glad to do it.
I'll go right now.
Thank you very much.
I followed him through his bender.
Sometimes, he gets the shakes so bad, you expect to see his teeth fall off.
- Is this all he had on him?
- Yes.
No money?
Gold.
"To Wilbur Patterson...
"With affection and admiration.
"City Attorney's Office.
December 25, 1900."
Where did you get this?
- I found it.
- Where?
- On the El.
- What line?
- Third Avenue, downtown.
- When?
I don't remember, it was months ago.
- Book him on suspicion of murder.
- No. I found that.
I never knew the man who owned it.
I never saw him.
Lock him up.
Please don't put me in a cell. I'm sick.
Can't you see my nerves are all shattered?
Look, please give me one little...
Can I have one little drink...
You're not going to get anything until you tell us where you got this watch.
- Take him out.
- Let's go.
You shouldn't have done that, my dear.
It is Cathy.
It's Cathy's body under the wax.
I knew it. I knew it all the time.
Everything I ever loved has been taken away from me.
Not you, my Marie Antoinette, for I will give you eternal life.
This is where I recreated my Joan of Arc.
It's an interesting process.
If you have patience with me, my dear,
I'll show you how it's done.
I can't stand it.
All right.
All right, I'll tell you what I know.
Patterson was killed because he looked like Booth.
- You killed him.
- No, not I. Jarrod, at the waxworks.
His hands were no good.
He had to take subjects from life.
- You helped him?
- No, they were already dead.
What about Burke?
He's there, too. In wax.
He was the one who set fire to the old museum.
Jarrod came out of it alive, but insane.
- Cathy Gray?
- Joan of Arc. That's Cathy.
She's there with all the rest of them.
The whole place is a morgue.
He'll do the same to Sue Allen, if he gets his hands on her.
You've got to stop him before he does any more killing.
That look of horror spoils your lovely face.
What if it should show, even through the wax?
Are you in there?
Where's Sue?
Where is she?
The end will come quickly, my love.
There's a pain beyond pain, an agony so intense... it shocks the mind into instant oblivion.
We'll find immortality together... for they'll remember me through you.
Where's Jarrod?
Andrews, where's Jarrod?
In the cellar. He's got Sue.
Take care of him.
The People's Exhibit Number One.
You almost lost your head. Would you care to keep that one as a spare?
No, thank you.
We'll never forget you and your men.
Thanks to you, we're still alive.
But every time I shave,
I can still feel that guillotine blade.
- Please, let's not talk about it anymore.
- Yes, you're right.
Mr. Brennan, thank you for the use of your coat.
- That was nothing.
- It meant a lot to me.
When I found you weren't dressed too warmly...
I didn't want you to catch a cold.
Goodbye, Mr. Brennan, and thanks for everything.
- Bless you, Mr. Shane.
- Thank you, Miss Allen.
By the time this guy gets out of Sing Sing... this head will grow a long beard.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's amazing how much we know about the surface of our globe.
In the last 100 years, men have progressively studied this.
Explorations have reached the North, the South Pole.
There are really relatively only a few square miles left of the surface of our globe that are not known.
During the same years, men have reached out into the stars, three times further in your lifetime and mine, three times further into space than men have ever been able to go before.
Amazing knowledge we have of that and of this.
What's inside this globe?
What is there beneath our feet as we stand on the earth?
No one knows, of course.
And science ponders about it and all men are curious, but no one knows.
Primitive man, going into caves, reaching back and back, and down and down, wondered what lay beyond, and in terror he fled out.
And he remembered strange sighs and noises.
Now you go back to Mesopotamia and the beginning of Western civilization, and you have the great hero
Gilgamesh going down into the underworld.
And so, too, with the Greeks.
All down through time.
Religions of the past have postulated the existence of this inner habitable world.
All through the Middle Ages, people believed of something under the surface.
Dante, the great Dante, saw great cone-like cavities stretching down to the very center of the earth.
There's nothing new about this. lt's as old as man, this belief that under the surface there may be areas inhabitable by man.
And in our time and in the last 100 years, there've been a number of theories, very curious and strange theories, about what goes on in the center of our planet.
This is a very famous and interesting and odd one.
A soldier...
Rather, a minor hero of the War of 1812 was a man named
John Cleeves Symmes.
And he had a sudden idea that inside our world, like onion layers, there were globes within globes, five of them, some of them inhabited, and that if you were to travel up through the icy wastes of our world, the northwest edge of Siberia, you could go down through a hole, and go successively to these various spheres.
Unfortunately, he was thoroughly obsessed with this, went around lecturing, and in fatigue, died before he could make this experiment.
Now, here's another theory much closer to us.
This is 1870, about.
A young American physician named Cyrus Reed Teed had a revelation.
We are not living on the outside of the globe, said Teed, but on the inside, that when we think we're looking out at the sun, we're really looking in at the sun.
Strange, strange.
Questing mind of man that tries to find answers to things that he can't understand.
This was a theory by Karl Neupert, in Germany, in the 1920s.
He, again, imagined that we're living on the inside, rather than the outside of the globe.
And here's a real sun, and a real moon, and then a rather shadowy and formless mass of electric potentiality with little bright sparks in it.
And they give us the sense of our stars.
So in this picture you're about to see, you'll see the culmination of a long series of such desires to look into the earth.
One might well believe, philosophically, that some ancient culture, engulfed by a great and tremendous upheaval of nature might linger on in some pocket of earth.
This is science fiction, of course. lt's a fiction. lt's a fable beyond fiction, for l think if you'll study this picture and think about it, when it's over, you'll realize that this is something more than just a story told. lt's a fable with a meaning and a significance for you and for me in the 20th century.
Thank you and goodbye.
Dr. Bentley! Dr. Stuart!
Come quickly.
Bellamin! Lafarge!
Come on!
Some sort of stone tablet.
What's it doing in this strata?
The cuneiform writing...
But it is not possible in this part.
You mean it's not probable, Lafarge.
In archeology, all things are possible.
The fact is we found it below the Great Flood level, so it must be at least
5,000 years old, which would make it one of the oldest human records.
What about the inscription?
Sumerian.
It's the dedication of a temple or a public building.
Stuart, every time i think of how many civilizations have crumbled, fallen apart, rotted from the inside, or cracked from the outside, i shudder when i pick up the front page of a newspaper.
The translation, Bentley.
Sure.
The first part reads,
"i, Sharu, king of kings,
"son of Sharu Ad..."
It breaks off there.
Sharu?
Well, that's a new one on me.
Mean anything to you, Lafarge?
Dr. Bentley, do you remember the Gilgamesh tablets George Smith found?
Yeah. They told a legend about a dynasty that suddenly disappeared from the face of the earth.
Right. lt also referred to a king of the dynasty, one called Sharu or Charul.
Well, what does the rest of it say?
"He who with malice destroys, effaces, or removes from its place this, my signed attestation, may he be denounced by lshtar."
"May his name, his seed in the land,
"be destroyed."
Earthquake!
We'll have to open new trenches tomorrow along the north line, Jud.
Most of the old ones caved in.
That earthquake put us behind at least a month.
You know, Bellamin, we shouldn't complain about the work.
I think we were fortunate.
The epicenter of the earthquake was only 25 miles from here.
Do you think the goddess of Ishtar is punishing us for removing the tablets,
Lafarge?
The inscription said
"He who removes it with malice."
But we aren't malicious, are we?
We want to rescue the Sharu dynasty from oblivion.
That's what archaeologists are for, no?
Archaeologists are underpaid publicity agents for deceased royalty.
This shepherd boy found something.
What, another one?
This boy came a long way,
Dr. Bellamin.
You buys your ticket and you takes your chance.
I believe in grabbing for the gold ring every time.
Hey! Where'd you find this?
Kuhitara. High, high.
Kuhitara, the epicenter of the earthquake. lt's a kind of moss that is native to this region.
It grows only on the rocks of Kuhitara, but not where the boy found it.
Much, much higher.
The earthquake must've dislodged it and rolled it down to the plateau.
But how did it get up on Kuhitara to begin with?
Maybe Bentley has the answer.
How's it coming, Roger? lt's an oil lamp all right, shaped like a boat.
The engraved figures are of a man, a woman and different animals in pairs.
The Sumerian version of Noah's Ark?
Exactly.
The Flood's been proven to be a historical fact.
Why not a Sumerian version?
According to the inscription they got wet, too. Listen.
"I, Sharu, king of kings, son of Sharu Ad."
"From water i emerged.
I caused to embark within the vessel
"all my family, my relations,
"my craftsmen and my slaves, and the beasts of the field,
"and made my home in the ark.
We floated on the waves
"until we found the land of the snow near the goddess of Ishtar."
The top of the mountain.
The Sharu dynasty was saved from the Flood on Kuhitara.
But was never heard of again.
Of course not. No one would look for human beings on top of Kuhitara.
We're going to.
Oh, it's impossible.
The summit is less than
20,000 feet.
It's treacherous. Always wind and snow.
Nothing's there, nothing.
Then we shouldn't be afraid of nothing.
Gentlemen, Kuhitara is a treacherous mountain to climb.
Do you think we can make it? l think so.
We shall establish three camps.
The porters will carry enough supplies to establish a base camp here at the foot of the snow level.
We will then climb to here, which is 2,000 feet from the plateau on Kuhitara, and establish a second camp.
The next day we shall attempt the final climb.
All this risk and money because of a vague poetic inscription on an ancient oil lamp.
Don't you trust poets, old man?
No, l don't.
Schliemann did.
He found the ruins of Troy by trusting Homer, the biggest blabbermouth of all.
When can we start, Nazar?
My men are ready, sir.
Tomorrow morning, then.
Kuhitara.
BELLAMlN: That's a lot of mountain.
We're only going to the plateau. ls that it on the right face, Nazar?
No, Dr. Stuart.
Tomorrow we may be able to see it, if we keep to our schedule.
Then let's keep to the schedule.
We'll make camp here.
Peaceful-looking, isn't she?
The thing that impresses me the most is the complete and utter silence.
You can almost hear it.
Don't let her fool you, Mr. Bentley.
When she wants to, she can scream so loud as to make you deaf.
And you will hear her and quite soon. l think perhaps even tonight.
Tremendous invention, gasoline.
Yeah, l'm well-done in front and my back teeth are chattering.
Cheer up, Jud. lf this storm clears, we'll be on the plateau of Kuhitara by tomorrow night.
Tomorrow night is 24 hours and 3,000 feet of thin air away.
Avalanche.
This mountain's hundreds of square miles in area.
You're only occupying one square foot.
Sitting here is a lot safer than crossing Times Square.
There's an avalanche. Come on!
Well, the goddess of Ishtar isn't smiling so sweetly this morning.
Look!
The avalanche must've brought it down from the plateau.
Can anyone be living up there now?
In this thin air, it's possible to imagine anything.
The ruins of a Sumerian temple.
I don't understand.
They usually built their cities near their temples.
Where are the rest of the buildings?
Five thousand years is a long time.
To make any sense out of all this is going to take a while.
I think we ought to send Nazar back for his men and set up permanent camp here.
Dr. Bentley,
Bellamin, take a look at this.
The goddess of lshtar?
Right.
How did the inscription on the oil lamp go?
"We floated on the waves till we found the land of the snow,
"near the goddess of lshtar."
Wait till Stuart sees this.
Paul!
Paul! l can't see the bottom.
We got to get down.
Get your ropes, Nazar. lt's getting warm.
Yeah.
We must've come down at least 200 feet.
You gonna be all right?
Oh, sure. l'm fine. l found him!
We are trapped here.
Say, this isn't a natural cavern. lt's been excavated.
You all right?
We are trapped here.
No food, no water.
There seems to be a draft.
There must be another opening.
Come on, let's look for it.
There's another tunnel.
You better take a look at Lafarge.
What's wrong? lt's the air. lt's hard to breathe.
Give me a hand with him, Jud.
There's light.
What do you make of the light?
Probably some chemical in the rocks.
There must be some rational scientific explanation for this.
Look!
It's an exact duplicate of the head we found on the plateau.
Here, gentlemen, is your city. lt's fabulous.
The city must have been built on a thick crust of earth, over a volcanic bubble strong enough to support the city until an earthquake came along.
What we found on the plateau were the suburbs.
You're right.
Look here.
"The temple of Ishtar have i built with the stones of the mountain.
"Sharu."
That's how the
Sharu dynasty ended.
They ran away from a flood right into an earthquake.
The children of Noah survived and the children of Ishtar died.
There's going to be some history rewritten when we get out of here.
How do you know there's a way out?
There has to be.
We'll keep looking.
How long can we keep looking?
We've been on our feet now over 15 hours.
Yeah. We got to get some rest.
Well, this is as good a place as any.
I think i'll sleep forever.
How is it?
It's as if the whole mountain were lying on my chest.
We're going to get out of here. Don't worry.
Now get some sleep.
What was that?
I didn't hear anything.
Is there anything alive in here?
Oh, nothing dangerous.
Dwarf lizards, small bats, things like that.
Go on to sleep.
What were they?
I couldn't see a thing.
I couldn't either.
Jud, come here.
Take a look at this.
Claw marks, or maybe a hand. There are four cuts.
Some hand.
And whoever it was needs a manicure.
It can't be.
It can't be.
Save your battery,
Rog. There's no way out of here.
We were brought in.
There has to be a way out.
What do you think, Jud?
I'm no anthropologist.
I wouldn't know whether they were Cro-Magnon or Neanderthal.
I don't think an anthropologist could classify this one either.
All we can say for sure is that they walk erect and they have a skull large enough to house a brain with associative areas.
And this one died as a result of a blow from a heavy, blunt instrument.
Well, that's a sign of higher civilization.
Bentley!
What is it?
Look!
Don't move.
He wants us to go with him.
No, don't.
Gentlemen, we are in 3,000 B.C.
In my hand i hold the magic eye of Ishtar.
The sacred weapon of Ishtar.
The golden rod, the secret of death.
There, O King, are the evil ones who were captured by the beasts of the dark.
Bring them here.
Who are you?
We are friends.
We are different from you, but we are your friends.
He speaks our tongue.
We come from a world where your tongue can be studied on ancient tablets.
There is no world beyond ours.
There is only heaven, where we lived a long time ago until we were expelled for our sins amidst thunder and fire.
This is the world and we are its people.
You are not of us.
There is heaven and only the gods live there.
Would you tell us that you are gods?
The greatest find of all time, and we're buried with it. ln the name of the King, l declare sentence upon you. lf you are evil spirits, you must be destroyed.
If you are mortal, as you claim, our world cannot support you.
In either case you must be destroyed.
You will die in the fire of lshtar.
Bentley!
Come on!
Bentley!
The light. Their eyes can't tolerate the light.
Help him up, Jud.
Stop! Stop! Do not run!
Guards! Do not run!
We won the first round.
Look at him.
No pigmentation.
Without sun or ultraviolet rays they turn into albinos.
The pupils are enlarged to let in the maximum amount of low-intensity light.
The optical nerve must be hypersensitive.
That's why they couldn't stand the light.
And how have they survived here?
What do they eat?
What happened to the mind, the memories of the past in the world of light?
So many questions.
So many questions.
And why is it necessary for them to kill us?
They have to kill us because we made them doubt their world is the only world, their answers the only answers.
Look out!
Lafarge, wait!
Lafarge, wait!
Wait!
We must get away from them.
We have to get out of here. lf we go back to the temple, we are lost.
All right, Lafarge, all right.
We've been going down all the time.
It's getting hotter and hotter.
The air is getting worse.
I can hardly breathe.
What was that?
I don't know.
Lafarge, you wait here.
Come on, Jud.
Listen.
Beasts! Guards! Get them!
The button's jammed!
Come on, let's go.
Come on, Lafarge! Come on!
It won't work.
Forget it. Come on!
I can't go on!
You have to!
Come on!
Lafarge, wait!
Well, at least Lafarge is at rest where he always lived, in a world of the past.
Oh, we're right back where we started.
There's bound to be a way out of here.
There's fresh air. lt has to come from somewhere.
Why don't we get back to the river and try and swim out?
Now, you know as well as i do that river runs underground for miles.
In the King's name...
Do not use the burning light.
We come to you as friends.
I wouldn't count on that.
What do you want?
Since you have shown that you possess the divine fire of Ishtar, the King is now convinced that you are holy messengers.
Are you speaking only for your King?
The King's will is law for all.
He has ordered me to assure you of his friendship and to invite you to a royal feast.
We are most grateful.
Where is the absent one?
He was called back to heaven by Ishtar.
Follow me.
And why did lshtar send you to our kingdom?
To see how you live, to learn of your needs so she can help you.
Does she not know us through our prayers?
Does she not reward us for our sacrifices?
Does she not see us with her all-pervading eyes?
We are her eyes.
Then you will see.
Our kingdom is your home.
Mushrooms?
Why not? lt's one of the few things that can grow without the sun.
Come here!
Do not interfere.
The King's will is the law.
The fire of lshtar is the law.
So be it.
You have fondness for her, have you not?
Yes.
She belongs to you.
Go.
The gods do not favor trading human beings.
Human? She is a marked one.
Are there many like her?
No.
Rarely is one born with the mark of darkness.
And the others like yourselves.
How many are there?
Twice and a half times 60.
Well, that's not very many. lt is a sacred number.
The highest number that our sacred food can nourish.
Well, what do you do when your population exceeds that number?
We kill them.
We sacrifice them in the fire of lshtar, the like of which you possess within that cylinder.
Speak.
The beasts of the dark have desecrated our dead.
They took the body of the guard that was slain by the intruders.
When they were finished with it, they left it in the tunnel.
All the flesh had been torn from the body.
You've apprehended them? l have, O Priest.
Kill them.
Let us now bless the spirit of the earth.
Ishtar has given us the food of the tunnels, the fish of the river, and the sacred milk of the goat.
Above all, we glorify lshtar for giving us power over the beasts of the dark, that they may till the earth beneath us, so that Sharu, king of kings, his children and his children's children may live in strength and rule the world.
So be it.
Well, even if there is a way out, we'll never find it.
Not without help.
You mean the albinos?
No.
Well, surely you don't expect the beasts of the tunnel to help us.
Why should they, after what's been done to them?
Five thousand years of slavery.
The planned degeneration has turned men into beasts.
There's no help there, Jud.
Thank you, Adad.
Lie down, my lord.
Well, go right ahead, Rog.
Don't mind me. l will watch you while you're away.
Away? ln your dreams.
What about you? When do you sleep, Adad? Or do you? l sleep when my sleeping time comes.
Your sleeping time?
But how are you able to tell?
Here, in my heartbeat.
One, two, three.
But you're not counting all the time, are you?
No, l just feel it all the time.
What happens when your heart beats faster? lt matters not. lt is my heart, it is my time.
Look, Adad, you'd better go home.
This is my home.
The King has ordered it so.
Well, never mind the King.
You're free to go. Understand?
Free? What is free?
Well, if you wish to go, you go, and if you wish to stay, you stay.
That's being free.
Then l am free, because l wish to stay.
But you're in danger.
Danger? Why?
Because we're different than your people.
They fear us and may try to harm us.
You're different, too, and if you're with us, it may remind them.
What are you going to do?
Try to get back to our world.
There's nothing beyond darkness, my lord.
Are you sure of that?
Have you never in your life heard of a world of light above the darkness?
No, my lord. Never.
Well, then, let me tell you about it.
The world of light changes color with every heartbeat.
There are mighty rivers and places where the land is covered with living things.
And then there are the cities.
Beautiful cities filled with many people like you and me.
You're speaking of heaven, my lord.
Maybe l am. Maybe l am.
Well, that's one way of doing it.
What is it?
Steam from an underground spring?
Something hotter than that. Lava.
Figure this one out.
You tan hides with tannic acid made from tree bark, right?
What do they use?
Want me to ask them?
No, not now. Let's go.
The Egyptians were able to weave very fine materials out of wool.
The stuff they're weaving here looks like burlap.
Well, the finer cloth is loomed by the priests.
One of their trade secrets. l sure would like to get out of here.
And that is not all.
The King has shown weakness and poor judgment.
He believes in the divinity of these intruders.
Dealing with the divine is our office. lf we abandon the smallest particle of it to outsiders, our position will soon come to naught.
But are these outsiders not divine?
No, they are mortal.
Do they not eat when they are hungry?
Do they not sleep when they are weary?
When the guards attacked them, did not their faces show the fears of mortal men?
But do they not possess the power of heaven?
The cylinder they carry possesses it. lf you had that cylinder, or you, or you, you could use it, too.
And if it is the power of heaven, is it not we who should possess it and use it to control the beasts of the dark, the people, and yes, if need be, even a faltering king himself?
You will therefore follow these intruders wherever they may go, and bring me that cylinder.
Here's something.
No, that's not it either.
That's hopeless, Roger.
Not as long as we're alive.
Why don't we just give up and apply for Sumerian citizenship?
I don't like mushrooms.
Now, don't complain, Rog.
Last night we had cave rat for dinner.
No, why don't we settle down?
Especially you?
Why especially me?
Well, there's Adad.
Just imagine what some future archaeologists would think if they happened to rediscover this world and the wild theories they'd concoct in order to explain the presence of dozens of little Bentleys speaking Sumerian with a Harvard accent, and playing baseball in front of the temple of Ishtar.
The Ishtar Nine, champions of the Little Mushroom League?
Come on.
Let's look around some more.
Yeah.
Is all in order?
In order, Captain.
Shall i feed them?
They're getting weak.
You have your orders.
They're not to be fed until you're told otherwise.
Guards! Sixty lashes!
Please don't interfere.
The beast has committed a crime.
He was hungry.
My orders are to keep them hungry.
Captain, look.
Do you realize you're bringing disaster on our heads, and yours, too?
Did you learn that song as a child?
I did not learn it, i found it.
It's beautiful.
As beautiful as you are.
No, i'm a marked one.
The priests said so.
They are so right.
It's not only the color of your eyes and your hair and your cheek that mark you, but your heart also.
It beats with tenderness.
The love of your ancestors is there.
Love? I do not understand.
Well, if somebody has hurt and his hurt gives you pain, or if somebody has joy and his joy gives you pleasure, that's love.
Adad, do you believe, as your king believes, that i'm one of your gods?
No, my lord.
Our gods are always angry and give orders. You smile.
If i ever get out of here into my world...
The world of light and flowers?
...will you come with me?
Yes, my lord.
My lord.
What is it?
The King wishes to see you at once.
The Captain of the Guards has been found murdered.
The beasts of the dark have done it.
It is possible they intend to revolt.
What about your guards?
Cowards. They tremble at the sight of their own shadows.
We do not want unnecessary bloodshed.
We need the beasts.
But with your cylinder of fire, you could bring them under control.
We will not take part in any plan to punish your slaves.
They are against us.
They are evil.
Ishtar has sent them.
I say to you that she has not.
Take their magic cylinder away from them and you shall see then that they are powerless, and we will have their power.
No, Elinu.
We will not challenge Ishtar.
Have the guards arrest three of the beasts and beat them until they are dead.
It's dead.
And so are we.
As long as they think we're armed, they'll stay away from us.
Come on, help me with these chains.
You're gonna release them?
We can't leave them here.
Why, they attacked us the last time.
The guards forced them to.
Go!
He was trying to say something.
They don't have the power of speech, but they can reason.
And all we can hope is they try to help us.
Ishtar has turned her face away from us because we have sinned.
The intruders are the sinners, and we are to starve because of them.
They are behind the rebellion.
It is they who encourage disobedience so that the beasts of the dark do not produce enough to feed us all.
If we cannot produce enough food, we must reduce our population as it is inscribed on the sacred stones.
We will offer them in sacrifice to our goddess so that the others can live.
In my hand i hold the golden rod, the secret of death.
For death shall appease Ishtar through the spirit bride of sacrifice.
Ishtar, who is married for life to the spirit of our world, to the glory of death.
I have something to show you,
Priest. Please come with me.
Wait. The King must see for himself.
The divine messenger who has gone to heaven.
He was mortal, as we are mortal.
And he is dead, as we shall soon be dead if we do not deal with the intruders.
What do you advise?
Give me freedom to act.
You have it. Destroy them!
Did you ever hear of anyone smoking dried mushrooms?
What?
Oh, nothing. Skip it.
What a pleasant surprise.
Where'd all the food come from?
Slaves back at work?
I don't know, my lord.
The food keeper was very generous.
Delicious.
Sit down, Adad.
Well, why don't you eat?
Royal food is not for servants.
Haven't i told you before that you're not a servant?
Yes.
And what else have i told you?
That i'm just like you.
Correct. Now eat.
In your presence, my lord, i cannot eat.
Adad, i...
I want you to...
My lord. My lord!
They poisoned me.
Seize them.
Guards! Kill them!
We've nothing to fear.
I have the burning light.
The eye of Ishtar.
Adad.
Sunlight.
To your people it was a burning death, but to us it's life.
You see, a long time ago your people came from our world.
You're a living proof that that's true.
But they didn't understand.
That's why they called you the marked one.
It's warm. It's beautiful.
And deadly for our friends of the tunnel.
That's right.
I'm afraid the world of darkness is theirs forever.
The priests must have had this secret for thousands of years.
Then finally the sun became too strong even for them.
You will take me with you?
Well, welcome to our world, Adad.
It's even more beautiful than i imagined.
Hey, Rog, look!
There's our gear.
Adad!
THE DEVILS
"A painting is always quite moral
"when it is tragic and it gives the horror of the things it depicts."
Barbey d'Aurevilly.
"Delassalle Boarding School"
- Monsieur Delassalle...
- Yes.
- It's about time you blew your horn. - It's okay...
I'll get the things out of the car.
- Your salads are rotten!
- You aren't paying for them.
Line up, please.
And be quiet.
Oh, what a pain.
- Lovely kids!
- Can't wait for the escape.
Get out!
Do your eyes hurt, dear colleague?
I hurt myself getting up.
You're up early. Last night,
I was doing my rounds... about 4 a.m., and I heard screams coming out of your room.
The chaste woman loves to contemplate dawn, doesn't she?
You spent too much time with the
Jesuits, M. Drain.
Everyone can't be thrown out of the school system.
Brute!
- "Tiene, Señora."
- Thank you, darling.
Oh, it's so nice!
We all need a vacation.
Our body needs to eliminate its toxins.
Tomorrow, mademoiselle, I'll be all naked, and you... how did you plan this long weekend?
I'll be home, in Niort.
Deux Sevres. Heard of it?
Sous-Prefecture Maine,
Bressuire and Partenay.
Getting some fresh air?
It warms up my heart, M. Drain.
It still has the smell of the country.
A graceful instrument, but with all the rains...
I prefer my old umbrella.
In my country, instead of your ugly black umbrella... you'd wear a sombrero and... spend your breaks in a hammock.
It's such a frivolous thing to give an educator.
Does your teacher really look that way, Jose?
Yes, sir. And he used to come to school on a horse.
I'll never get used to it.
I told him it was a horse to please him.
- It was only a mule.
- Go play, Joselito.
- What's the matter?
- Look.
- Miguel.
- Of course, Michel. Who else?
- Did you have another fight?
- He came back at 3 a.m.
How have you stood him for so long?
He wasn't always that way.
At the beginning, he really made me happy.
It was for your money.
Why are you trying to be nasty?
Don't you think... life is hard enough for us?
I may be reactionary... but this is absolutely astounding.
The legal wife consoling the mistress. No, no and no.
- What the hell are you both doing here? - Nothing.
Nothing. Like kids. Nothing.
Come on and kiss me!
- Did you look at me?
- Are you still angry?
What about you, Cricri, aren't you kissing your husband?
Let's see... aren't you supposed to be on break today?
I told her to stay.
- Don't you see how she looks?
- Exactly. She needs air.
And her shoes. Did you see the soles?
I've always told her to buy heavy shoes, the real things.
A sick person shouldn't worry about her appearance.
- I'm not sick.
- She's delicate, you know it
Delicate? Yes, when she came from Caracas.
Today, she's a cute little ruin.
She doesn't risk anything.
Ruins are indestructible
She'll bury us all. Won't you, my little ruin?
That's enough. Go out and play both of you.
Yes, a black little bottle.
She smelled it like that, and it wasn't perfume.
I can tell you, they drink.
That's why they're always together.
- What was in the bottle?
- Whiskey, idiot!
Please, I don't want to hear about that anymore.
Patard, if you want to spend your vacation here... you'll have all the time to draw.
M. Patard, you heard.
You won't go on vacation.
Miguel, what's the matter?
- I didn't want to punish him.
- So don't threaten him.
Patard did very well on his English quiz.
That's not a reason to disgrace himself.
I won't have any regrets.
No. I can't. I can't.
I wasn't even able to get a divorce. So!
- Do you still love him?
- Of course not.
- You can't understand.
- Am I stupid?
- Divorce is a deadly sin.
- Really!
And what about the knife you carried around for a month...
- Wasn't that a deadly sin?
- I was jealous. I was mad.
But to concoct this thing... No.
As you wish. But think about it.
We'll never find a better opportunity.
And we have just three days.
Everyone knows I am leaving for
Niort. You'll come and rest.
- Don't you believe in hell?
- Not since I was seven.
I do.
- Fish again.
- Not fish again.
It's the same fish as last night.
- Make me two fried eggs.
- You're not gonna start, are you?
I put in a liter of vinegar and a kilo of onions.
I'm not saying it's bad. But, you can smell that it's fish.
It stinks.
Yes, yes, later, later.
No, thank you.
- Help yourself.
- I'm not hungry.
You must set an example.
My liver doesn't allow me fat.
M. Delassalle, may I ask for a glass of wine?
- You already had two.
- Only one. Only one.
Well.
"Bonum vinum laetificat coro mini."
- What is it? A bone?
- I told you I wasn't hungry.
I'm asking you to eat.
- Swallow! - I can't help it.
I just can't.
Swallow.
- Delicious fish, M. Raymond?
- Perfect. Perfect.
It seems extremely nutritious.
What these gentlemen need, is a little hard time.
Be quiet or I'll keep you all here this weekend. Swallow.
Everyone is looking at you.
Swallow.
- It's disgusting.
- Sorry?
Some things are hard to swallow.
I'm not talking about the fish.
M. Drain, throw these hooligans out of here.
What is this supposed to be?
You're going to eat your fish and shut up.
- I told you to throw them out.
- Yes, sir.
- M. Raymond, go help your colleague. - Yes, sir.
Get out, everybody. What is this?
Get out and be careful.
What kind of a supper is it for these growing boys?
A slice of sausage and two spoons of mashed potatoes?
They should've eaten what they were served.
- In the army...
- You're not an adjutant
- But a soup merchant. - I can't buy coalfish for 3000 francs.
You'd rather make them sick.
As a kid, we used to buy whiting.
Coalfish was too expensive.
They need expensive fish.
I buy it but... at a price that I can afford.
It's a mistake to buy on sale.
The fishmonger is not as stupid as we are. He knows.
It's not his money. It's mine.
I'm paying for everything here.
I'm paying for the doorkeeper.
And M. Drain.
I even paid Germaine, Sabine,
Therese.
I'm paying you too, Nicole.
I accept it.
But when the kids are involved, it upsets me. I...
I can't stand it.
Calm down. It's not good for you.
I'd like to die, and not see him anymore.
Die darling.
Die, and do it quickly.
We'll have a nice funeral for you, and we'll get rid of you.
The school won't suffer... and I'll feel much better.
Well, children, have fun.
I have to wake up early.
I'll go and pack.
Well, so...
I'm leaving at 7 a.m.
Have a nice vacation, darling.
Take care. See you, the other one.
Have a nice vacation!
A three day honeymoon.
Oh no. Oh no.
Nicole!
- Nicole! - I'm up here.
I'm coming down.
What are you doing?
Be careful. Move back.
Those riding the bus, raise your hands.
Will your sister still be in the bathroom?
If we get there before ten.
You'll see, I made a hole.
- Give me the pack back!
- You'll see my sister naked.
- It's worth a pack a cigarettes.
- No! Give them back to me!
Soudieu, aren't you part of our group?
No. We'll share a cab, the four of us.
Money is pouring out of your pockets.
Don't you have a suitcase, de Gasquet?
The chauffeur will take it.
He's being paid for that.
Our personal chauffeurs don't do their job right, dear friend.
Have a nice vacation, sir.
- You too
- Thank you.
Plantiveau, did madame come down?
I was ringing the bell when they drove through the gate.
- I opened it.
- Both of them?
Madame Delassalle and
Mademoiselle Horner.
I thought you knew.
Of course, I knew. I just forgot.
Except that it's a problem.
Especially for these gentlemen.
One of you must stay to watch those on detention.
- You'll feel funny about coming back to Niort. - Why?
- That's where you had troubles in high school. - Troubles...
I resigned, that's all.
- Do you still have your parents?
- No.
I've got a couple of teachers living on the first floor.
- What? There are people in the house? - I thought about it.
I thought about everything.
We are not risking a thing.
You're tired. Do you want me to drive?
You can't drive.
I could never afford a car.
- This way, I cannot think.
- Good. So keep driving.
Keep your nerves for tomorrow.
We'll never have the courage.
- You don't know me.
- Yes, I know you very well.
You can wish someone's death, but kill...
You must've wished my death, didn't you?
I didn't. But he did.
He would say to me...
"Don't worry. With her heart condition, it won't take long.
"After she dies, we'll share the school."
It's horrible!
Don't you believe me?
What did you answer?
- Do you want me to be honest?
- Can you?
- I didn't know you that well...
- Don't talk.
I'd rather not know.
Watch the step.
Mlle. Horner!
What a surprise!
Don't bother.
What a huge trunk.
It always upsets M. Herboux when I take...
- more than a suitcase.
- Good evening.
Mme. Herboux, M.A. In grammar.
Mme. Delassalle, my principal.
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.
Don't forget my rent.
By check, please.
Don't torture me.
I'm so embarrassed.
I thought of giving it to you tomorrow or the day after.
But we didn't get paid for the examinations in Vausson.
We were counting on that money.
But don't worry...
- I'll come tonight.
- No need. I'll come up tomorrow.
We're a little tired tonight.
Yes, she looks sick.
Make yourself at home.
Home, sweet home.
Turn off the light. It's a waste.
- Already? - Let's do it now and forget about it.
Hello, operator. I'd like a line to St. Cloud.
The number is Molitor 27.45.
Thank you.
I like to have my feet free.
When it's cold...
I put on ski socks instead of slippers.
Well, what are you waiting for?
You see, it doesn't bite.
And it doesn't slap either.
Hello? Who is it?
Answer, for God's sake!
It's you!
From Niort. My compliments!
Do you think I can afford to send you away in the Poitou?
What about the gas?
What are you talking about?
I'm telling you that we need to separate.
Yes, I want a divorce.
You are young, you are strong.
You can make a nice living.
The school was part of my dowry, so I'll take it back.
We'll start the proceedings right after the holidays.
- What? - Don't give me that crap.
I'm coming.
I'll take a train tomorrow morning.
I'll meet you at Nicole's.
- So? - He's coming tomorrow on the evening train.
Well, Germaine?
You're nuts. You'll catch cold.
I'm not cold.
I'm suffocating.
- You've got fever.
- No, I'm just hot.
I thought you'd never come back.
That he'd get here before you.
It doesn't always go as you want it to.
That's life. Everything was closed.
Did you buy a tablecloth?
Yes, a nylon, waterproof one.
- It's too big!
- It won't be big for him.
Guess how much?
2500 francs.
That's how they make money.
Let's open it.
That way it won't look weird.
Well, let's not waste it.
- Here, it will cheer you up.
- No.
You should, it's not bad at all.
I've never had that before.
- You're supposed to put water in it.
- It would be a waste.
Hand me the small bottle.
- Won't he notice anything?
- Not a thing.
He'll sleep like a log.
- Will it leave any traces?
- None.
It's a sedative.
He'll digest it.
I'm sure he won't come.
That's him. That's his train.
Put that over there.
Stop, please, stop.
It's awful.
- We must fill it up.
- I can't do it.
I can't do it, not today.
We must do it, and you know it as well as I do.
- It's either today or never.
- Then never!
Let's forget about it.
I can't handle this.
As you wish. But I must warn you.
If you miss your chance he won't miss his.
Not after your phone call.
I don't know. I just don't know anymore.
Nicole, please, help me.
What for? It's beyond your strength anyway.
I should have never trusted you.
I got involved too, and you abandoned me.
Yes, you're right.
I'm not worth anything.
I'm just a ruin, a little ruin.
That's what he said. But... the little ruin will get her revenge. She'll do it.
Even if she collapses afterward.
My only regret... is that he'll never know that I killed him.
Come on, before you were giving up, now you're excited.
What you need is to relax.
Relax a lot. You must keep cool.
I will. I swear that I will.
I must go upstairs and see them.
Can't you stay with me?
If the Herbouxes look out the window and...
- see him come in...
- You'll come right away, won't you?
As fast as I can, I promise.
Be brave, in half an hour, it will all be over.
I'll find her a husband.
I'll redeem myself.
She's young, she'll be rich and she'll be happy.
I wasn't expecting you tonight.
Mme. Delassalle is resting and I'm not tired.
- May I come in?
- Please, do.
We were listening to the radio.
We've finished eating.
The drama is over.
Zapi Max starts in a few seconds.
Dear listeners, you've just heard...
"One Should Never Laugh at Love" by Alfred de Musset.
God!
- Good evening, Michel.
- Good evening.
Come in.
So, are you proud of yourself?
Not so loud, the neighbors.
Don't worry. I don't want to be noticed.
A man who runs after his wife is ridiculous enough.
I left the school like a thief.
I had to hide from Plantiveau.
Hiding from my own doorkeeper!
It's humiliating.
I couldn't tell him where
I was going.
You have forced me to come, what are you waiting for?
- What?
- Pack your bags.
- No!
- What?
- I'm staying.
- Are you refusing to come?
I thought that was clear.
I'll come back after our divorce.
- Have you decided to get a divorce, you? - Yes.
With your religious beliefs?
I won't get married again, that's all.
But getting a divorce is like getting married... we must both agree.
- My lawyer doesn't think so.
- You have a lawyer?
- Attorney Berthoux, 64 Victor Hugo.
- Berthoux?
You can check in the phone book.
I went to see him this morning... and he assured me that I'd get the legal separation quickly.
He told you that?
Funny lawyer!
- Of course, I told him...
- You told him... all of our secrets... about our private life.
You told everything to a stranger?
An animal who enjoyed every word of it?
You, the former nun!
I'm telling you, it's disgusting!
Didn't you talk about us to your lovers?
Do we still have secrets?
Is there anything that Nicole doesn't know?
Her! If you believe her!
Two words, three lies.
There are details that she couldn't have invented.
She can invent anything!
God knows what she told the lawyer!
- I'll go see him, and put things straight. - No!
- You won't stop me.
- No, later. Tomorrow.
- Right now, he must be having supper -Well, I didn't eat.
- He won't receive you.
- We'll see.
When I tell him that I came all the way from Paris...
Don't. I didn't see a lawyer.
I lied to you.
You too. It's contagious.
So, what about the divorce, was that a lie too?
No, I really want the divorce.
It's the only way.
For your sake as well, Michel.
- It will be better for both of us. - Come on, Cricri.
You can't be serious. Do you know the price of a divorce?
- And what about the scandal?
- What scandal?
I'll have to take a lawyer to defend myself.
And lawyers never stop talking.
Parents won't entrust you with their children.
- They'll take the children away from me? - Of course.
You'll go bankrupt.
Not that I care much.
If it were up to me, I would have sold it a long time ago.
With your money and my contacts
I'd have gone into business.
We could have lived comfortably.
But you wanted this kid business. I gave in.
- It was security.
- Big deal!
We traded in the big car for a small one.
I gave up my training.
I used my old suits.
We are rich and we live like poor people.
Do you know how I paid for my trip?
I sold my dictionary, my big dictionary.
And I did that for you.
Believe me that I don't regret a thing.
But when you throw me out... it upsets me, Cricri.
It upsets me a lot.
But anyway, you made me feel miserable.
We used to fight, like every other couple.
Well, girls, what about this!
Wait. Don't lie. You mustn't lie now.
You made me very unhappy.
You might not have been aware of that, but it's the truth.
- Ask Nicole.
- Please, don't talk about... that bitch. She's setting you up against me.
She exploits the fact that you're sick. She has a good mind.
Yes. She's got knowledge, taste...
- Taste? - Maybe. But she doesn't have a good mind.
That's it. I'm firing her right away... and we'll replace her with a man.
A good, honest, old man.
- Michel! - For God's sake!
My Prince of Wales suit!
You idiot! Go get a handkerchief, a towel!
It will stain and I'll stink of alcohol.
Just go!
Here and here.
It doesn't pay to be nice to you.
I will break you, girl.
Well, what are you waiting for?
Bring some hot water.
We're leaving now and we'll be back tomorrow morning.
How long did you have to drive?
Ten, twelve hours?
Well, answer!
Can't you talk?
Eh, woman, another glass!
I don't know... I feel dizzy.
You can't measure anymore.
That's enough.
Nice color.
Stop looking at me with your insane eyes.
Who's paying? The princess?
By the way, where is she?
Is she scared? Hiding?
She's upstairs visiting the tenants.
Mademoiselle has tenants.
She never told me that.
- I'm exhausted. It's the train.
- Just lie down.
- Whose bed is this? Hers or yours?
- Ours.
That's a scream.
Shoes. Take off my shoes.
What's the matter with me tonight?
I don't want to sleep.
I don't want to sleep.
We have to leave.
What are you doing?
- Just sleep.
- Why did you turn off the light?
I'm so tired!
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. Go to sleep.
- How did you get in?
- I came through this door.
- How many drinks did he have?
- Three.
He was very good.
He's dreaming.
He's ready. We can take him.
Take off his shoes.
- What the hell is she doing?
- She's taking a bath.
At 10 P.M.? Funny habits.
Oh, shit!
Tell me, sir, where are the
Straits of Mozambique?
Between Madagascar and Africa!
It is precisely located between Madagascar... and the Coast of Africa.
Bravo, sir!
32,000 francs!
I must ask you now:
What do you want to do?
- Do you stop or do you carry on?
- I will go on.
Of course, I carry on.
I was winning 32,000 francs and
I can't hear a thing now!
- Poor baby! - Bitches! Bitches!
Daughters of bitches!
I didn't even hear the question!
Midnight baths! The decline of Rome!
It's a problem of enjoyment!
I have the right to send her a registered letter.
And I'm not saying that
I won't do it.
The 17th at 10:05, 06 P.M.
- What are you looking for?
- His return ticket.
Here it is.
With the restaurant bill.
Burn it.
Let's go. You take the feet.
It's lighter.
Together.
The bronze...
The bronze on the mantel
Give it to me.
Now, the tablecloth.
The tablecloth.
It's over.
Did he suffer too much?
He didn't feel anything.
Let's go right away and bring him back tonight.
What about our alibi?
When they find him, we'll have to be able to prove... that we were here the day he died.
That's why I'm using the idiots upstairs.
She still hasn't emptied the tub.
- So what?
- So I can't go to sleep.
When she opens the drain, the noise will start again.
It won't fall on your bed.
I can't sleep under
Niagara Falls.
- Are you planning to stay up all night? - I'm sitting down.
I'll give her until midnight.
- Here they are!
- They took their time.
When I passed by the cafe, at twelve... they were already there.
They must know how much it costs them.
- Lf you were a landlord, and
I a school principal... - Sure.
We could also afford good meals.
Well, I'm going to take a nap.
Here we go, the flood!
- What's the matter?
- He's so ugly!
I've had it! They must get the hell out of here!
Too bad you're leaving us so soon.
It was so nice to have company...
You know, school is starting tomorrow.
For us as well as for you.
I just came to take my dishes.
It's quite heavy.
Wait a minute. Would you have a piece of string?
A piece of string? No.
Wait. This might help you.
I'll try, yes.
Let me do it. It'll be easier for you.
It won't work. Your trunk is crammed too full.
- Let's take some things out.
- No, no.
Yes. I'll bring you the old tin trunk.
It's very strong. It went through the 1940 retreat.
- Start emptying the basket!
- No, it'll be fine.
- We're already late, aren't we,
Nicole? - That's what I told them.
Anyway, it's fine now.
We can load.
Attention! Clear the way!
On my command. One, two!
Now, it'll be easy.
A little kick in the ass.
I'll start the engine.
- That's it!
- As you say!
M. Herboux, thank you for your help.
- Don't mention it.
- All the same...
- Here, this is for the road.
- Thank you, madame.
Drive carefully, the roads are dangerous.
They have mobilized 1500 policemen.
You'll find one at every crossroad.
Goodbye, madame.
And thank you again.
- Have a good trip.
- See you soon!
It won't be this time.
- A little bit earlier, or later.
- Great...
There is only one possible end.
We are monsters.
I don't like monsters.
If it's only him, I feel better.
Because... the grain of sand falling off the hands of providence...
I'll keep that for my Sunday school lesson.
Well, don't stop!
It is about time!
All the gas stations were empty!
No wonder! It was crazy today.
Wait. There is always some left in the bottom.
- 963 francs. - I only have a 5,000 franc bill.
Come with me.
I'll get some change.
- Are you going to Tours?
- No, I'm not.
Could you give me a lift?
The bus driver wouldn't take me.
He's anti-militarist, like me.
We are already two. Can't you see there's no room?
I won't take room.
A second class soldier.
If I don't report, they'll put me in jail.
Have some pity for a soldier.
Leave me alone. You're drunk.
Me? Hey you!
I'm being polite. And if that's the way it is...
I'll just get into your car.
I won't let you. Do you hear me?
Nicole! Would you get out!
- What is it?
- Don't worry.
He's drunk. I know him.
He's not a bad guy.
You should be ashamed of yourself, Robert.
Get out of here, or I'll push you out myself.
The pig. What did he do?
The floor is all wet.
I'll clean it.
No, no need. We're in a hurry.
Thank you.
Start the car. There's a hole in the nylon!
- Did you hear that?
- It sounds like the boss.
- He decided to come back.
- It's about time!
Is this the time to make all this racket?
If we only ring,
Plantiveau won't open.
Three short strokes, that's Michel's signal.
Plantiveau is a heavy sleeper.
I'll wake him up myself!
- Come on Plantiveau!
- It's you?
I thought it was M. Delassalle.
What? Isn't he here?
Do I know? Ask him when you see him.
- You look tired.
- Are you surprised?
You can go.
- Sorry to have awakened you.
Good night -Good night.
Turn off the light.
For our number...
- we don't need spotlights.
- No music either!
Oh, not now.
- That's the bathroom light
- It's Pascual.
I heard he gets up every night.
He might be able to look out the window.
- Can we see him from here?
- No.
Either the water is too dirty, or we're too far away.
I'm telling you that we can't see anything.
What's the point in staying here?
We're not supposed to discover the body.
- Close the window. It's freezing.
- Shut up. It stinks in here.
Good news. The principal didn't come back.
- He's in heat. - He's already got two chicks. Isn't that enough?
Of course, not. When I grow up,
I'll have a lot.
Look at Napoleon and
Louis XIV.
All the big men used to have a lot of chicks.
- Do you think you're Napoleon?
- I'm Falcon Eye.
M. Moinet, stop playing the fool.
I'm not a fool.
I am an Indian.
Then you can write:
"My absurd comments provoke...
"my friends' hilarity",
20 times.
What do I hear?
The principal is missing?
This is the third time, dear friend... that I drink my wine, chemically pure.
Where is he? I saw him the day before yesterday... around eight o'clock. By twelve, he was already gone.
And he didn't show up again?
That's not like him.
Poor Mme. Delassalle.
She has enough troubles already.
If she's no more worried than
I am, he can stay where he is.
But believe me, he'll be back soon.
And we'll start drinking bad wine again.
Did you notice?
This afternoon... it seemed that he pretended not to see the body.
The body was at the bottom.
- Do you think it will rise?
- It has to.
- When?
- How should I know?
- Tonight. Tomorrow morning.
- It makes me nervous.
We cannot ask to empty the pool.
Try to understand.
It's natural to empty a pool when the water is dirty.
What we find inside won't be natural at all.
I'll take the responsibility for this.
In order to take responsibilities, you have to be an adult.
You think like a child.
You're not worth anything.
How can you grade papers?
By mistake I just wrote complete nonsense
- Well, erase it.
- I don't have an eraser.
If his body doesn't come up by tomorrow...
I'll manage to have the pool emptied.
And I hope we won't regret it.
Don't bite your nails.
I was not in the game.
- Look!
- I was expecting that.
Don't bring attention to it.
- I told you not to look.
- Do something!
My heart is about to explode.
You promised yesterday.
Give me the keys. We'll move things faster.
That was clever. Go and bring the pole.
Me! Me! Me!
Soudieu! Let's test you on a 100 meters.
As for you, you need some training in the shot put.
You're lucky. You have a champion skin diver here.
- Soudieu! I forbid you!
- Let him! He's a champion!
What's happening?
It's taking him too long.
He might be drowning.
Did you see the bubbles?
Did you get them?
Say something!
I found it. It was shining in the mud.
It looks like M. Delassalle's lighter.
- And you didn't see...
- The keys!
It's chocolate soup at the bottom.
Go get dressed. Don't catch cold. We'll manage.
I think we'll have to empty the pool.
You're right.
Send Plantiveau over.
What are you waiting for?
Plantiveau...
It's deep where you're standing.
- It's all right. I can swim.
- So what?
A lot of people who can swim drown.
Because the ones who can't stay away from the edge.
- I want you to empty the pool.
- Right now?
I'm not dressed for it.
I was going to the barber.
Do it now, Plantiveau.
It's urgent.
- Do it for me. - All right.
The fish will wait.
Only to empty the pool will take an hour.
She's upset. Be cool.
Why are you staring at me?
Is something wrong with me?
Again. The surface of a hexagon... in relation to the radius of the circumference?
Well, I'm waiting.
I'm waiting...
- 6 AB x 1/2 OH. - Thank you.
Good. Go back to your seat.
Take out your notebooks.
Wait a minute. I'll be back soon.
M. Plantiveau!
What happened to her?
It can't be true.
It's impossible!
- I didn't see well!
- You saw very well!
- He isn't there anymore?
- No, he isn't.
- Come in. What is it?
- It's the doctor, mademoiselle.
I think it comes from the open space, the empty pool.
She suffers from agoraphobia, and she got dizzy.
- It's possible.
- Nature abhors a vacuum.
An empty pool isn't worth a full bottle, Plantiveau.
Is she feeling any better, dear colleague?
Dr. Loisy is with her.
You'll take her pupils for study hall, M. Raymond... and you, M. Drain, watch my class for a few minutes.
Mme. Delassalle might still need me.
Of course. Did you notice?
She gives orders now.
- So, doctor?
- That's what we should all expect.
When it's used, it's used.
Where is the husband?
He should come here fast.
In the meantime, no emotions, no vexations. Spare her.
Don't you think a specialist...
If you want, I'll call Bridoux.
He's 60 years old, but he's got the best ear in Paris... and he's the finest gourmet!
For him a meal is a meal.
Anyway, give her some digitalis.
- The doctor said... - I don't care.
Close the shutters and go.
No. It would be too easy.
Much too easy.
Does a corpse that disappears seem natural to you? Not to me.
If he's not in the pool, someone took him out.
I asked Plantiveau if he opened the door for anyone.
- He said no one.
- Why would he lie?
If no one went out... the body should be around here.
I've searched everywhere.
The attic, the basements, the garden. There's nothing.
No dirt, no footsteps.
There's nothing.
My head is about to explode.
It's crazy.
It's been crazy since the beginning.
Not even a kid's game.
You took one of your word problems with leaking taps, and tanks that empty... and you planned a murder from it.
In real life, this kind of thing does not exist.
Bathtubs that we fill up, swimming pools that we empty.
That was crazy. And I was crazy to listen to you.
Come in!
Somebody brought back monsieur's suit.
The one he's been wearing lately.
- The Prince of Wales.
- Who brought it back?
- The dry-cleaner.
- What dry-cleaner?
I don't know. He came on a bicycle.
He looked at the street name... and asked again if it was the right address.
A very conscientious little guy.
Get to the point.
He said it was from
M. Delassalle.
So I asked him: "Did you see
M. Delassalle? Where?"
So he said:
"I didn't see him"... but he asked me to bring the suit home, urgently.
Well, should I hang it up in the closet?
No. Leave it here.
It is his suit.
That's completely insane!
Wait.
Rue St. Ferdinand.
- Good morning.
- Excuse me.
Did you deliver a suit this morning in St. Cloud?
- What's the name?
- Mme. Delassalle.
- Was there a problem?
- No. We just want to know who...
- brought this suit to you.
- We see so many of them!
If I remember well, it was a tall thin man, dark hair... with a bamboo cigarette holder.
There's a check mark.
The kid forgot something.
It was in his pocket.
Eden Hotel. Room nine.
Your husband seems to be leading some life!
I can have the kid bring the key, if you wish.
Do you know this hotel, madam?
It's a residential hotel.
Very cozy.
Come on!
First street on the right.
Number 27.
- I'll go.
- What if they ask you something?
It looks like they don't ask questions here.
Don't go, it's a trap. Someone wants to blackmail us.
At least, we'll know with whom we are dealing.
- What are you doing here?
- I'm looking for M. Delassalle.
He's never here during the day.
- When does he come back?
- Who knows if he comes back at all.
His bed is always neat. See, no belongings, no bags.
Nothing. Some weird guest.
Did you ever see him?
Never, neither did the doorkeeper.
He must come, after I leave... and before the other guy starts his shift.
But, why all these questions?
He's my husband.
I am Mme. Delassalle.
Poor lady! This isn't where you should look for him.
You can trust me. His life is somewhere else.
It's scary. What's happening to us?
I don't know.
No one knows.
It doesn't make any sense.
80,000 francs. Shower repair, and it's two years old.
Ah, this time it smells the bailiff.
Pay them half. It's already something.
- He was really dead, wasn't he?
- You're the one who should know.
- Why are you saying that?
- You killed him, didn't you?
- Me? - You are the one who planned the whole thing.
I'm sorry, we planned it... and you made the phone call.
You bought the tablecloth to wrap him... the drug to put him to sleep.
I would have been unable to do that.
- But you made him drink!
- You liar! I didn't want to!
You know I didn't want to!
You could've let him sleep his whiskey off... instead of carrying him to the tub.
Who filled up the tub?
Who pushed him under water?
And who brought the bronze from the mantel?
It's too easy.
You'll see whom the court will hold responsible.
- You'll see.
- The court doesn't scare me.
We'll get what we deserve.
Well, suit yourself!
Go to the police! Go!
- I thought of that.
- To put the whole thing on me!
I won't let this happen.
I'll call the cops first!
Call them, but I'm warning you,
I'll tell them everything!
I have nothing to hide.
You were jealous, and killed him.
And I helped you because
I felt pity for you.
You were jealous because it was over between you two.
You killed him, and you know it!
So, what are you waiting for?
- Do you have my newspapers?
- Yes.
Be careful not to get dirty.
The ink is still wet.
- Christina!
- I have nothing to tell you.
- Where are you going?
- To confession. Do you mind?
Do you think you'll get absolution if you don't turn yourself in?
- So I'll turn myself in.
- What about me?
I can't keep this up.
Come on, don't worry.
It's all over.
They found the body.
Read this.
"A Naked Corpse in the Seine"
- Why in the Seine? - What counts is that they found him.
Everything fits.
The description...
The Bois de Boulogne bridge which is very close... a three day old death.
Our alibi is holding up.
They brought him to the morgue.
I read this, and I think it's my husband.
Identity card.
Could you describe
M. Delassalle?
Dark hair, thin, dark eyes.
All this has already been written in the paper. It's too easy.
- I want details.
- What do you want to know?
I don't know. You tell me.
If you tell me he had an appendectomy...
- it's a detail.
- He's had the operation.
- Dentition. How many teeth?
- All of them, I think.
- Fillings?
- Maybe one or two.
- One or two?
- Two.
- Beauty marks?
- Yes.
- Where?
- On his shoulder.
Why didn't you tell me he had a bracelet?
- He never had one!
- Really!
- What do you see on his right thigh? - Nothing.
Try to think, above the knee.
I can't see anything.
So it must be a mistake.
Bring up number 4702.
You were right.
No bracelet and nothing above the knee.
Please, follow me to the identification room.
- It's not him.
- Are you sure?
- Yes! - I'm sorry, madame.
This rarely happens.
Taxi! To St. Cloud!
St. Cloud? Now?
Are you out of your mind?
I don't want to have supper on a merry-go-round!
Excuse me...
Here we go!
Aren't you feeling well, lady?
Maybe it's the emotion.
The reaction only comes after, doesn't it?
You should feel better since it's not him.
Drive.
Do you feel better?
Let me introduce myself.
Alfred Fichet, retired police commissioner.
But I didn't ask the police for anything!
Didn't you inform the police commissioner?
It was a mistake.
That's what they are for.
I didn't think about it.
I'll do it.
I'll do it myself. Just out of principle.
One should not expect too much from the regular police.
The police are too busy.
No. If you'd like, we are both going to find your husband.
40 years on the job, it's not to be ignored.
Now, I have plenty of time.
- No. Really, it's not necessary.
- What do you risk?
If I don't find anything, you won't pay me anything.
And if I find something... well, you'll judge for yourself.
You can't ask for a better deal.
Let's see.
- You've been married...
- Eight years.
- I don't understand what...
- Leave it to me. I know.
We are saying eight years.
It's boiling, mademoiselle.
- How long do you think it can boil? - Five minutes.
How do I know.
He had his own keys.
He would go in, and out.
He was the boss.
And it was vacation anyway.
- Was he a little low-spirited?
- It was not his style.
It was more in his nature to complicate his life.
- Maybe he was feeling sick.
- Couldn't be.
The man was very strong.
When he was younger, he was a tennis champion.
Did he get a telegram on Sunday?
A phone call? Sometimes, people leave after a phone call.
I can't tell you, sir.
This Sunday I took my wife to the park... and when the school is closed, we seize the opportunity.
There might be the hypothesis of the accident.
Did M. Delassalle used to drive fast, very fast?
He didn't have the car.
The women took it to Niort.
That's right. Don't you think he could've drowned?
Drowned? He was a real fish.
This man could swim.
I see. Well, thank you.
The Alps separate Italy from
France in the southeast.
The Alps are very high mountains.
There is Mont-Blanc, the highest mountain in Europe.
In the east, there is the Jura...
That is quite reassuring.
I think you worried a little bit too early.
On Saturday, your husband was still here.
It's only been five days, and you go look for him at the morgue.
The article in the paper upset me.
A 30 year old man, one meter seventy...
Dear madame, there are 100,000 men in Paris who fit... this description. And this doesn't include the tourists.
I guess you were thinking of suicide.
Yes. Well, I don't know.
To commit suicide in the Seine, one doesn't need to undress.
My hypothesis is much less tragic.
When I say hypothesis,
I mean...
A woman! Of course, you're right.
I was stupid to worry and to bother you.
- Take this.
- No, no. I won't steal your money.
Remember our agreement.
If I don't find out anything, you don't owe me anything.
But, don't worry, I'll find him.
I haven't been in a school for a long time.
In my days, it was the local school. Charonne.
Less fancy. Much less fancy.
Ah, it was really different.
You emptied the pool.
You thought about this too.
- Not at all!
- Why not at all?
I dropped my keys in the pool.
- So in order to get them back...
- When was that?
- Yesterday. - Commissioner
Fichet. Mlle. Horner.
- Our most devoted associate.
- Hello.
It was pure coincidence.
Really, the keys in the pool, the husband in the morgue...
You dream too much about water in this house!
May I look at his mail?
- You'll never find him.
- How do you know anyway?
- I see he has a typewriter.
- Yes, for the accounts.
You're right. M. Delassalle is not a literary man.
Perhaps he doesn't trust his spelling.
May I? I seriously can't imagine him that desperate.
Let's take this seriously.
So we're saying:
Delassalle Michel...
- 34 years old...
- One meter seventy.
- Yes, I know. Dark hair. Eyes?
- Brown.
Average nose, ears... folded in.
How to find someone with this description?
Well, we'll find him.
These pigs are so strong!
What was he wearing the day he disappeared?
We were away that day, sir.
Of course! How stupid of me.
Here's what we'll do.
We'll look into his wardrobe... and we'll see what is missing.
One, two, three, four, five, six. Six.
- What did the 7th pair look like?
- Brown suede.
- Tie?
- Red, with a white stripe.
You're sharp-eyed. He's got at least 25 ties.
So, suit?
Suit!
So you know his ties better than his suits.
I think it's a Prince of Wales, grey.
Prince of Wales, grey.
- Like this one?
- Yes.
- Wait a minute.
- Is something wrong?
Mme. Delassalle has a heart condition. We must spare her.
You should have told me.
It's not that urgent. I've got enough to keep myself busy.
Take care of yourself.
I'll go visit downtown.
I still have friends there.
And don't worry. I'll be back.
- Plantiveau said he's a detective.
- A private one.
Everybody to the firing squad!
Heberge, if you're done with your work...
I'll find something else for you to do.
First, Latin. When the Middle Ages lost everything... they still knew Latin.
The Church understood it.
The last village priest knew Latin.
I don't think that the average priest... is that clever.
It's not his job.
M. Moinet, what are you doing here?
Aren't you supposed to be studying?
- The principal punished me.
- Who?
- The principal.
- What are you talking about?
- It's the truth.
- What did you do?
I broke a window.
Maybe the principal came back.
Stop talking nonsense.
Tell me the truth, now.
- Who punished you?
- The principal.
- That's for lying!
- I'm not lying.
Let me handle this.
You're scaring him.
Tell me your story again.
And if you tell everything,
I'll lift your punishment.
- How did you break the window?
- With my slingshot.
- Then what happened?
- The principal opened the door... and told me to go to bed right away... without picking up the dead leaves.
It can't be him.
It's impossible.
You know he's not here.
You forget that this kid is a pathological liar.
Last week, he told his friends he had a fight... with a lion at the fair.
With a lion!
He's a mythomaniac.
I just asked the other kids.
Nobody saw the principal.
But there really is a broken window in the corridor.
He punished himself in order to create this story.
Who knows? Obviously... this is a case of self-induced hallucination.
The kid broke a window and in his subconscious... he generated the idea of punishment... to match the principal's.
Darkness did the rest.
- Do you really think so?
- No. The kid saw himself... being punished in the literal sense of the word.
I think he's kidding us... in the literal sense of the word.
- Give me your slingshot.
- The principal took it.
Don't you think you're a little out of line?
I feel tired. I'm going to sleep.
- Suit yourself.
- Goodnight.
Goodnight. Go get some rest.
M. Moinet. We've been patient enough.
If you want to be stubborn... go straight to the corner.
You'll get out only after you tell the truth.
We'll see who gets tired first.
I saw him. I saw him.
- Moinet couldn't have brought this slingshot. - Certainly not.
- So who could've done that?
- It could be anyone.
- It's a coincidence.
- Coincidence!
Fichet at the morgue, was a coincidence.
And the suit, and the hotel, and now the students.
Is it a coincidence that it's getting closer each time?
Please, calm down. My nerves are going as well.
It's all getting clear.
There are no miracles in life.
Unfortunately.
Each time I close my eyes... it seems that I'm going to see him.
Don't talk. He must already be in some condition.
Yes, if he's dead.
Listen, I've seen dead people in my life.
Believe me, Michel is dead.
Really dead.
Lie down and try not to think of anything.
With all I have on my mind...
If you don't get any sleep, you won't last three days.
Dr. Loisy is very worried.
He asked Prof. Bridoux to come tomorrow.
There you are!
What's the point now?
I'm finished.
- Stop that.
- Give me back my marbles.
- I don't have them.
- You took them, I know.
- I'm going to break your neck!
- Leave me alone!
- Give him back his marbles.
- Leave me alone.
- I haven't got them. Stop it!
- Come on, come on!
You can fight, but don't scream.
Mme. Delassalle is very sick.
Moinet, your punishment is lifted... for now.
- Go for your picture.
- Thank you, sir.
A picture without the principals, is not a school picture.
We'll do better next year.
Come on, children.
Do we put the bench in front of the window?
- Why not in front of the door?
- What about the car?
There is a professor from the university upstairs.
I must go. It's part of the job.
I'll show the professor out, and I'll call you.
You overdid it.
You should really have a good rest.
- Will I be able to get up?
- We'll talk about this later.
- You will be fine here.
- Could I go out into the yard?
- Is it too much for me?
- Until the doctors say so... you are not supposed to move.
Let's do it. Look at my hand.
Don't move.
One, two. Thank you. One minute.
I'll take another one.
You can go through.
Taking her to my clinic would have been too expensive.
Between you and me, there are no heirs.
I know. But people dying in the clinic... the hearse in front of the door,
I don't like that.
Neither do the patients.
- Let me see! - Be careful, kids.
It's still wet.
Great. Nobody moved.
Please... I came out fine.
This is the first time I've had the position of honor.
When I show the picture, they'll think I'm the principal.
- What do I see behind the window? - Looks like the boss.
- You're nuts!
- Wait! Let me put my monocle on.
- Let me see, mademoiselle!
- Leave me alone!
- I didn't see anything?!
- You didn't miss anything.
It's some kind of shot-silk effect.
The reflection of a cloud or some spot on the window... that reminds us of the principal's features.
Maybe it's him!
He didn't want to interrupt us... or this was just an innocent joke.
I can't see Delassalle playing hide-and-seek.
But you, didn't you see anything?
I was looking at the group, being sure to see everybody.
Let's settle this once and for all. Moinet.
You're such a great observer.
Did you see the principal?
Six hours in the corner, thank you, that's enough!
The case is closed.
There wasn't anyone.
Thankfully. Really.
To hear people saying... that people go in and out of here... without me knowing it, it's offensive for a doorkeeper.
- I'm afraid.
- Me too.
We must go now.
Here, get dressed!
The doctors forbid me to move.
Where would we go, anyway?
To my place.
In Niort? Don't you think he might be there as well?
He's more certainly there, than anywhere else.
So, we'll travel, we'll go anywhere.
It's not possible.
There's no point.
- I can't stay here anymore.
- So, just go.
What about you?
I can't leave you here.
Yes. You'll see. And you'll get used to managing without me.
Besides, I don't want to see you anymore.
For all that's about to happen... for all that will eventually happen...
I'd rather be on my own.
No, no, please!
- You hate me, don't you?
- Not at all.
Where is the little red suitcase I gave you?
On the floor, by the closet.
So you really think it's time for us to separate?
Yes, it'll be better that way.
- I hope you succeed and forget.
- Farewell, Christina.
"Tremble, she told me, a girl worthy of me.
"The cruel God of the Jews is stronger than you.
"I pity you for falling in his fearsome hands."
- What are you doing here?
- I was just looking at you.
I came to make my report.
That's what I'm paid for.
But you were sleeping so deeply...
Leave me alone.
I'm sick, very sick.
You'll feel better very soon.
Everything is fine.
Can't you have some pity for me and let me die alone?
Do you think I'm not dying fast enough?
What's the matter with you?
It's not the time to die.
I found him. He'll be here very shortly.
It's wrong, and you know it.
You know he can't come back.
- Why?
- Because I killed him.
- This afternoon?
- Five days ago.
Five... So we mustn't be talking about the same one.
- Five days ago in Niort.
- And you went to the morgue?
- His body disappeared.
- From Niort?
No, from here! We brought him back in the truck... in a wicker trunk.
When we got here, we threw him in the swimming pool.
But you weren't alone in Niort.
- You were with mademoiselle...
- Horner.
Horner, yes. And didn't she notice anything?
She was his mistress.
She helped me. - I see.
She was his mistress... and she helped you. Well...
I wouldn't mind listening to what she's got to say.
- She got scared, and she left.
- It was obvious...
It won't work. It's Michel's.
It was under water a whole day.
Well, well...
Aren't you arresting me?
You should stop playing with your nerves.
You need a strong sedative.
Goodnight.
Shall I turn off the light?
Tomorrow morning, you'll wake up acquitted.
He disappeared. She's deficient.
In addition, Nicole runs away.
- Doesn't it remind you of anything?
- Registering for unemployment.
I'm afraid. Here's the cop.
I found it under the diving board.
- Isn't there a wicker trunk around here? - Yes, sir.
- Above the garage.
- So, let's go.
It's starting to stink.
You wonder if anything happened to Delassalle.
You're a witness that I didn't know anything.
Me either, dear colleague.
Right. Let him manage alone.
I don't know why, but...
You think that we fucked up.
Me too.
M. Pacard. Moinet.
- Goodnight, sir.
- Goodnight.
Who's there?
It's over, this time.
She's was tough.
The bitch. She used to say that she had a heart condition.
My poor darling.
You're all wet.
Go change your clothes.
In the bathroom, it took me... more than one hour to get out of the tub without making noise.
You must've suffered during the trip in the trunk.
What about the dive in the pool in the middle of the night?
She made life terrible for us.
I got scared more than four times.
Wasn't it worth it?
Now, we're rich.
Just by selling the school, we'll get a lot...
Between 15 and 20 years in jail.
It'll depend on the judge.
Moinet, Moinet.
Wait a moment.
You again, Moinet. You should be ashamed of yourself.
On the day we're closing the school.
- Who gave you this slingshot?
- Mme. Delassalle.
- Who? - Mme. Delassalle.
She opened her door.
She gave me back my slingshot.
She said: "This is for you,
Moinet. Have fun."
You are impossible.
You know that she's dead.
- Her body was taken away today.
- She's not dead. She came back.
M. Moinet, go to the corner.
I saw her.
I know that I saw her.
Don't be devils. Don't ruin... the interest your friends could take in this film.
Don't tell them what you saw.
Thank you for them.

But with release of pressures, judgment may be unsound for some seconds.
- Shall I take over on remote control ?
- No. Give him a few more seconds.
Dan, do you hear me ?
I repeat, do you read me ?
Cannot direct hands toward stabilizers.
Steady me. Steady me.
Electronic controls, take all stabilizers.
- I'm trying, sir, but I can't get equalization.
- Keep at it.
Listen, Dan, this is Dr. Von Essen speaking.
You are weightless.
Without concentration, you cannot coordinate your senses.
Listen to me.
Tell me what to do, Doc.
Tell me what to do.
First, control yourself.
Now, forget everything else, and watch your left hand.
Without taking your eyes off it, put it down... until it is resting on something.
No matter what.
Take your time.
Be quick, Doctor.
If he hits atmosphere at this speed, he'll burn up.
When you have hold with your left hand... do the same with your right.
Bring it slowly forward until you can grasp the stabilizer.
Watch carefully until you are steady.
Now concentrate and you will regain control of Y-12.
You're moving outside the preset radar position.
We're going to lose you.
Can't help it !
Can't help it !
I've got control, but I can't reduce speed !
Radar control,
Y-12 gliding outside preset orbit.
Track five degrees west.
Tracking five degrees west, sir.
You'll never hold him.
He's going !
His only chance is to bounce the atmosphere until he loses enough speed.
- Radar Control, keep tracking west !
- Yes, sir.
Track west. Keep going !
Keep going ! Keep tracking !
Well, if we don't hear soon, we never will.
Why didn't he obey orders, stick to the test plan ?
He should have !
You cannot blame your brother for this tragedy, Commander Prescott.
For a few vital seconds, he was not himself.
I wish I could agree with you, Doctor.
We do not yet understand the physiological conditions... a man may have to endure at such heights.
My brother's always been unpredictable.
He's a heck of a good pilot, the best we ever had.
Well, he knew the limits.
Why did he disobey orders ?
It was a physiological condition clouding his judgment.
Chuck, we've progressed a long way in the development of aviation medicine.
But the conditions we simulate in the high-altitude test chamber... just aren't the real thing.
It's like...
Captain Richard's office.
Commander Prescott speaking.
What ?
Is the pilot all right ?
Now, where ?
Say that again slowly.
Puerco. Yes, yes. I know the place... between Albuquerque and Santa Fe.
Listen, don't let anyone near it.
We'll be right over.
We found Y-12, sir.
Badly damaged, but in one piece.
And Lieutenant Prescott ?
Is he safe ?
Yes, he's all right.
Yes, sir ?
Have Hyatt bring around my car on the double.
- Salvage officer speaking.
- Captain Richards.
Team up the Y-12 crew.
Get 'em loaded and have a salvage crane follow me to Puerco.
I'll radio directions, but get going'.
Well, Commander, looks like you're losing me another night's sleep.
Afraid so, sir.
Commander Prescott, U.S. Navy.
Where's the plane ? just off the road over there.
We're sure glad to see you.
We're mighty cold and hungry.
Should have been off duty a couple hours ago.
Well, thanks for stickin' around.
Where's the pilot ?
Oh, he's around here someplace.
The plane's just over here.
Right. Thanks.
Take it easy, Clancy.
It's me, Whitney. I brought the navy.
Huh. What in, a land yacht ?
You see it come down ?
Yeah, right down the valley.
We took a quick look and radioed in to headquarters.
Where's the pilot ?
The relief patrol took him into town.
Into town ?
But he's okay.
Sure. He looked like a man from Mars in that getup.
Talked sense, but he acted kinda loony.
What do you mean ?
I don't know. Kind of high, I guess.
But I'll tell you one thing...
- I'll send in a report to you in the morning, sir.
Well, she's badly beaten up, but with any luck, the instruments might be okay.
Let's hope so.
Good evening, sir.
Boy, that pilot's the zaniest guy I ever saw.
How come ?
He had me take him into town for a change of clothes.
Said he had some dame to see.
Couldn't even wait for coffee.
Well, I guess I know where that'll be.
Mind if I borrow the car, skipper ?
Sure. We'll ride back with the salvage crew.
- Thank you, sir.
- Take it easy.
Oh, Dan, I wish you were not a test pilot.
It is so dangerous.
Honey, it's my future.
It's our future.
Who's gonna forget the first man in space ?
They don't forget Lindbergh, or the Wright brothers.
- You talk too much.
- You can always shut me up.
I will.
Oh, don't talk with the macaroni.
Answer the door.
- Is Lieutenant Prescott here ?
- Yes.
In there.
But...
Hiya, brother. 
Have a drink.
What the heck's the matter with you ?
You just wrecked $10 million worth of aircraft, and I find you lollygagging around here.
Why aren't you back at the base making out your report ?
As a matter of fact,
I was just on my way.
Okay, wise guy.
Taylor.
Escort Lieutenant Prescott back to the base... and inform the duty officer that he's confined to quarters until further notice.
Yes, sir.
Now get up !
You can see how it is, honey.
I'll phone you soon as I can.
You can pull all the rank you want.
You're very good at doing that.
But just remember this :
You couldn't pilot a kiddy car to cross the other side of the street.
If it weren't for guys like me, you'd be dead ! Nothin' !
Why did you treat him that way ?
Right now he has no business playing house with you.
He's got a job to do and that comes first.
Not always, Commander.
Dan knows what he's doing.
Does he ?
I'm not so sure.
Why don't you quit riding' the boy, Chuck.
He disobeyed orders.
Y-12's a wreck and we were darn lucky to salvage the instruments.
All right. But you got to look at it both ways. just think of the progress we made.
Come in.
Yes, sir ?
Simmons, take this to
Commander Barrett.
- Tell him I'll be there in five minutes.
- Yes, sir.
I got something else here you can worry about.
We're putting Y-13 on a four-week countdown as of tonight.
Four weeks ?
Yeah, the Pentagon just came through.
- We're priority go-ahead. - Mmm.
We'll be really sweating blood to get this on time.
All right, then sweat blood and read your orders.
I have an Apex to free in 30 minutes.
Look at that baby go.
Isn't she beautiful ?
You're, uh, released on Captain Richard's orders.
- It's about time.
- That's not all.
It seems the Pentagon is so impressed with your fame... that you're to pilot Y-13.
That's great !
But you're not so very happy about it, are you ?
I just want to be sure of one thing, that there are no mistakes... that you obey every instruction given to you.
- Your reactions are slow up there.
- That's not the answer I want !
- What do you want me to say ?
- I want you to say that you understand... that you're the pilot, but I give the orders.
Unfortunately, I think you'd do anything for this.
- Get off my back, will you !
- I'll get off your back... as soon as you realize that we're developing a piloted space plane... and not a record-breaking hero !
All right. As I said before, your reaction is slow up there.
Well, we'll see to it that you get plenty of time for a checkout... before the next fight.
Dr. Von Essen will give you a thorough indoctrination... so that your reactions are automatic.
Now get your things together and get over to Aviation Medicine.
Yes, sir.
- Miss Francesca ?
- Yes ?
What are you doing here ?
I'm sorry, Commander, but I'm in a hurry.
Wait...
Chief, what is Miss Francesca doing here ?
Check in' in some material with Dr. Von Essen, sir.
I don't understand you, chief.
What sort of material ?
She's on Dr. Von
Essen's staff, sir.
Aviation Medicine Department.
I wish she was working here.
I'm all for scientists in skirts.
Hmm. You and the rest of the navy.
Come in.
Commander Prescott.
Congratulations.
- Y-13 should be a fine project.
- Oh, thank you, Doctor.
- Sit down. Cigarette ?
- Uh, no. No, thanks.
Say, uh, Doctor, do you, um...
Do you have a Miss Francesca on your staff ?
You do not visit us often enough at the university.
- How long has she been working for you ?
- Some months.
She has charge of the cardiographs... and probably knows more about your brother's heart than he does himself.
Yes. From what I've seen,
I wouldn't be surprised.
She's good for him.
He's quieter, calmer... and in love.
In love ? 
Are you kidding ?
You're too close to your projects, Commander.
You do not notice people enough.
- Are you sure of this ?
- I should not say it otherwise.
Well, what do you know ?
What sort of an idiot does that make me ?
Why in the heck didn't 
Dan say something ?
You don't seem to have your brother's entire confidence.
No, uh, Doctor, I'm afraid I don't.
You wish it were any other man than Dan who should pilot Y-13 ?
Well, he's not the man
I'd personally pick for the job.
Why not ?
I just don't think it's in his nature... to stay inside any organized pattern.
It's not an unnatural characteristic to find in a man who risks his life for a new achievement.
Maybe so. But on a project such as this,
I'd prefer to have someone more reliable.
Well, he will be in my care until you are ready for the fight.
I'll pay some attention to his psychology.
Yes, would you let the psychiatrists work on him, Doctor ?
Make him understand that even though he's up there in space, alone... he still has to obey orders.
Attention all personnel... stand by for Y-13 rocket motor testing.
Y-13 tied down.
Fueling completed.
Stand clear for test. Stand clear for test.
- Like to go over the fight plan again ?
- What, again ?
- I know it blindfolded.
- I know. Let's go over it again, huh ?
Okay. Okay.
We blast off at 45,000 feet, crash the heat barrier... out into the stratosphere in six seconds.
Fifty seconds later,
I break through the chemo sphere.
- And you switch off your refrigeration plant.
- Check. But keep tracking me.
Buffeting in Y-12 was so severe
I couldn't read my instruments.
- Oh, that and the barrier of control.
- Mmm, yeah, that's really tough.
It's as much as you can do to hold on.
You sure you can take over when you reach ionosphere ?
If you want to, we can take you past rocket burnout.
No, no. That won't be necessary.
Now that I know what to expect,
I'll be ready.
Y-13 countdown. Zero minus 54 minutes.
Repeat, zero minus 54 minutes.
Well, von Essen did a good job.
You look pretty good.
Never felt better. I wish he was comin' today, though. I like to have him around.
The air force has priority today.
Y-13 countdown.
All personnel assemble.
All personnel assemble for takeoff.
Well, good luck.
And you take it easy.
Thanks, Chuck. But don't worry.
I'll bring you back all the dope you need for Y-14, and then some.
Come on. Let's go, huh ?
Right. five, four, three, two, one, drop.
Y-13 to Control. Y-13 to Control.
"G" pressure gone. I'm weightless.
- But gyros holding steady.
- Okay, Dan, we're with you.
Now check controls for atmosphere bite.
I'm checking now.
- Steady her up. That's enough !
- Take it easy, Chuck.
Approaching 500,000 feet. Check ?
Check.
You're doing fine, boy.
Now, commence your turn in 15 seconds.
Chuck, she feels like she'd go on forever !
Stop talking ! Concentrate !
- Your altitude is 600,000 feet.
Prepare to turn.
Dan ? Y-13. Y-13.
Commence your turn immediately.
No, sir, I'm going straight up.
First man into space !
Commence your turn !
Commence your turn !
Sir, we're losing contact.
Switch to remote control !
Over to remote control, sir.
- Dan, are you reading me ?
- So long. See you in space !
- Dan ! Dan, are you reading me ?
Are you reading me ?
Remote control won't respond, sir.
- He'll be out of atmosphere any second now.
- He's still climbing.
The fool's fred his emergency boost !
This is an emergency.
Keep all radio beams open.
Instruct all radar to keep scanning constantly. Bring in everyone.
Warn all spotters.
This is an intercontinental priority.
Yes, sir.
Well, he's on his own now.
The first man into space.
He'll either hit the moon or orbit the Earth the rest of his life.
Control ! Control !
I've done it ! 250 miles !
I'm going to turn now.
This is Y-13.
Y-13 calling from over 250 miles in space.
My rocket motors are burned out, and my gyro stabilizers cannot turn me at this height.
I'm going to use release mechanism to catapult myself and the nose away from the plane.
Control ! Control ! Are you reading me ?
This is Y-13.
Control ! Control ! Are you reading me ?
This is Y-13.
Y-13 calling Control !
I'm running into some meteorite dust !
Pressing ejector button now !
Wish me luck.
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Si. Si.
Kalinsky ! Yeah. Yeah, sure.
We'll take care of it right away.
Yes, sir ?
Some Mexican farmer called Sanchez.
He says he caught sight of a parachute floating down.
It landed just outside his farm.
I don't know, he says there's something like a front half of a plane... or something attached to the chute.
- Where's he located, sir ?
- Just off Route 17.
About 10 miles south of Alvarado.
You better get the nearest patrol car out there right away.
- Yes, sir.
- Meantime, I'll call the navy base.
Might have something to do with their rocket fringe.
Hello. Get me the duty officer at the navy base.
Smash-up on the south highway.
Bus full of people and two trucks.
No report on deaths.
Should have word from car 51 any minute now.
- Yeah.
- We got two witnesses.
- They're definite about the way it happened.
- Uh-huh.
Krupke's getting their reports now, and he'd like you to follow up.
Yeah. Okay.
Have him call me back.
- Morning, Commander. Glad you could make it.
- Morning.
I'm Wilson, Assistant Chief of State Police.
Well, thanks for phoning in, Chief.
Uh, whereabouts is it ?
Oh, just up there a ways in the bushes.
- Any... Anyone hurt ? Any damage ?
- No.
Dropped about a half a mile from the nearest farm.
Came down like a dame in a feather bed.
No sign of the pilot though, huh ?
Well, uh, you better come and look for yourself.
Well, what do you make of it, Commander ?
I don't know. It's, uh, too early to say.
Uh, I've never seen anything like this before.
It'll have to go into the test lab.
Well, the pilot's had it.
That's for certain.
Smashed the canopy in.
Yeah, he couldn't live up there in space.
- You got a minute, sir ?
- Why ?
Could you come up and take a look at what we've got up here ? There's a farm.
- You okay ?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.
Salvage crew's right behind me.
Oh, uh, look, will you have one of your men stand guard ?
I've got to go in to Albuquerque and make a call.
Oh, sure. I'll be here myself.
Well, thanks for your help.
Always glad to help the navy.
What's the trouble ? 
Oh, it's this Mexican farmer.
He's had a lot of cattle slaughtered for no reason I can see.
- Well, let's go and see.
- Okay.
I knew this would happen.
I didn't want him to go.
Yes, I understand.
How could you understand ?
- To you, Dan was just a piece of machinery.
- Now, that's not true.
You wanted him to risk his life.
I had to put Y-13 into space and Dan as a pilot because those are my orders.
- Orders !
- Tia...
Dan couldn't exist unless he were risking his life.
If he weren't piloting Y-13, he'd find his own brand of danger somewhere else.
He had to prove he was the best.
If you knew all this, why didn't you try and stop him ?
I did.
I don't believe you.
I've been trying to stop him ever since we were kids.
He was always climbing the highest tree... or swimming further than anyone else.
With Dan it was all the way or nothing.
He wanted to be the first man into space.
And he was.
Before we lost track of him, he was higher than any man had ever been.
Higher than any man.
That's all you can think of.
I wanted him to give up flying, to settle down.
If he had, do you think he'd have ever been happy ?
No, you're right.
I just can't believe he's gone.
I've got to get back to the base.
Will you be all right here alone ?
Alone...
Yes, I'll be all right.
Well...
Chuck...
I didn't mean to blame you.
Look, I'll, um, stop by the Aviation 
Medicine Department tomorrow... and see you if you'd like.
Thank you. 
I'd like that.
Good-bye, Tia.
We're, uh, running some metallurgical tests.
It seems as if the skin was subjected to some sort of incrustation we've never heard of.
Any idea how high he went ?
In weakened gravity pull, he could go a long way.
Could be anything... 250, 350 miles.
Chutes seem okay.
The usual signs of scorching.
Yeah. The, uh, automatic escape mechanism operated perfectly too.
And this breaking chute opened just right, as soon as it hit full atmosphere density.
But it was too late to save Dan.
Nobody could live once the canopy burst.
You'd be dead in a second.
Have a look over here.
This incrustation has some remarkable qualities.
You see ? 
Nothing.
Nothing at all.
X-rays will not pass through it.
- No luck here either, sir.
- Thank you.
This is the infrared photograph.
But the rays do not penetrate to show us what is below the surface.
And here under the ultraviolet lamp...
I can't understand it.
It's resistant to any identification or penetration test we can do here.
We'll take a photograph anyway.
There may be some reflection we cannot observe, though I doubt it.
Hmm. So far, then, your tests are negative.
Well, let's hope the metallurgical report will give us a line.
- Let's hope.
- Let me know as soon as you have it.
Well, good night, Doctor.
Good night, Chuck.
- Good night.
- Good night, sir.
You know, you better get some sleep.
I will, skipper. Thanks.
What is this stuff, Doctor ? Do you think a chemical breakdown could tell us anything ?
We do not even know the primary reactor.
I'll send a sample to my own laboratory.
We may find the answer more quickly.
Yeah, l, uh... I can't get him out of my mind, Doctor.
I can just see him up there now in the cockpit.
He, uh, wanted you there today.
Maybe if you had been...
- If only I had...
- You mustn't blame yourself, Chuck.
Maybe you're right.
Look, I'll check with you first thing in the morning.
Yes, I'll do that.
Thank you, sir, and good-bye.
Come in.
Hi, Chuck. Glad you came by.
I want to talk to you.
Have you seen this, skipper ?
Uh, not the headline.
Read further down.
"In the past 24 hours death has struck in mysterious and terrifying ways.
Type of wound inflicted is fearful and inhuman."
Read the middle part, sir.
It talks about the slaughtered cattle.
That farm is right next door to where Y-13 fell.
I've got a call in now to Chief Wilson.
I don't get the tie-up.
- Yeah ?
- Call for Commander Prescott, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Commander Prescott.
Yes, Wilson. Where are you ?
Alameda ?
What ?
Yes, well, I'll be there as soon as I can.
It's like I said, Commander, about the wounds on the Mexican's cattle.
Look, this one's the same.
It's like a tearing jag there across the throat. See ?
Who or what could cause this wanton destruction ?
Well, I don't know, but it seems to like the taste of blood.
See, it... it looks like it's been scooped up or something.
And look here. Look.
Takes more than human strength to do this.
Unless he had an ax.
- Chief.
- Yeah ?
- Give me your flashlight, would you ?
- Sure.
Look there. See on the edge of the wound there ?
What ?
Those little shiny specks.
Oh, yeah, yeah. I see.
That's funny.
I never noticed those before.
What do you suppose they are ?
When you do an autopsy, will you send a sample of that... to a Dr. Von Essen in Aviation Medicine ?
Sure.
Think they mean something ?
I don't know.
But I'd like to take a look at that Mexican's cattle.
Okay. We'll go over as soon as we're through here.
Well, there you are, Commander.
Take a look.
There's a dozen more like it in the lower pasture.
Esta muerta.
; Que cosa terrible !
Who want kill Clara ?
She win many prizes at feria.
See what I mean ?
It's the same thing.
The throat ripped right open.
Mmm. Looks like it kills whatever it comes near.
Yeah.
You have any idea what sort of a weapon could cause such a gash ?
No, not yet, but we're working on it.
Wait a minute. Shine your light.
- Oh, yeah. Those shiny specks again.
- Mm-hmm.
Would you send a sample of this also over to Aviation Medicine ?
Why, sure.
What are you trying to say, Commander ?
That something from outer space came out of that missile ?
I don't know, but I'd like to have them compared... with the sample we took from the nurse at the blood bank.
Okay.
You think it's gonna help us find the killer ?
Well, I can't say.
But let's hope we catch it before it does any more killing.
Well, it can't escape my roadblocks forever.
But if you've got any ideas, Commander, you've gotta let me in on 'em.
Here. Lift that head. Yeah.
What is it ?
Looks like a high-altitude oxygen lead.
I've gotta get back to the base.
I've got a lot of work to do.
But don't worry.
I'll keep in touch.
Yeah, sure.
Pero, senores, quieren pagar mi ganado ?
- I gotta go now.
- Okay.
- I'll be back this way next Thursday.
- Okay.
Don't forget to keep my side warm.
Don't worry. I won't let it get cold.
Uh, hello, I'm Commander Prescott.
I'd like to see a Miss Francesca.
I'll see if she's free.
They're just finishing an altitude test.
Commander Prescott to see Miss Francesca.
I'll bring him down.
- Come with me, Commander.
- Thank you.
Watch out for sphere density and final reactions carefully.
Only 10 seconds to normal.
Right. Open the chamber.
Careful with his helmet.
Hello, Tia.
Hello, Commander. Good to see you.
- How are you feeling ?
All right.
I've got plenty to do. It keeps my mind off of it.
Yes, it does help, doesn't it ?
I was on the way over... to see about some blood tests the police sent over this morning... and I thought I'd stick my head in and say hello.
That's very nice.
Do you want me to see if they are ready ?
I'd appreciate it. Thanks.
Pathological.
Hello ? Are those blood tests ready for Commander Prescott ?
They are ?
Could you please send them down ?
He's waiting for them.
Thank you.
Well, that's fast work.
We try our best.
- Do you want some coffee ?
- Yes, I would. Thank you.
- Black ?
- Please.
- Sugar ?
- No, thanks. I'm fine.
You look tired.
Yeah. Well, maybe this'll help.
How did you ever end up in Albuquerque ?
I came with my father two years ago.
He and Dr. Von Essen were very good friends.
They were at school together.
And when my father died,
Dr. Von Essen asked me to stay on and help him.
What part of Italy are you from ?
Turin, from the north of Italy.
- Ever get homesick ?
- Not anymore.
It's strange... The first time
I met you, I thought...
Well, it just goes to show you how wrong a person can be.
- Do you want some more coffee ?
- No, thanks. That's fine.
Thank you.
"Embedded in both samples are innumerable particles of meteorite dust...
"that show no sign of structural damage...
"such as would be expected from passage through atmosphere.
"Detailed analysis will be needed before a confirmed opinion can be given.
A full report is requested on the origin of the dust."
Has this got anything to do with Dan ?
I don't know.
Look, Tia, I've got to get back to the base.
I'll see you again as soon as I can.
- Thanks for the coffee.
- Good-bye, Chuck.
We have the results of the metallurgical tests.
Hang on a second, Doctor.
I'd like you to take a look at this.
Later, later. 
Come over here.
I want to show you something.
Well, uh...
This is a sample of our new secret alloy... of which the fuselage of Y-13 is made.
You know the terrific heat and pressure it will stand.
This is a piece from the fuselage which was coated with this strange substance.
Notice the metal underneath has not been affected.
Now, this is a piece we removed from the stabilizer... that has escaped being encrusted.
Look. It has undergone a complete transformation.
It does not even retain a resemblance to metal.
It's like, uh, crumbling carbon.
And if I grind it... there's nothing left but powder.
What could cause this transformation, Doctor ?
Difficult to say.
Possibly cosmic rays we do not yet know or understand.
And where it is coated, this transformation hasn't occurred. Right ?
Exactly.
So then it could be that this is some sort of cosmic protection.
Could be.
Commander Prescott, report to Captain Richard's office, please.
Commander Prescott, report to Captain Richard's office, please.
I'll, uh, be right back, Doctor.
Although I accept your explanation, senor captain... there is no doubt that it was providence that His Excellency was not killed.
But the place where the tail section of Y-13 fell... is 10 miles from your town.
What is 10 miles, senor, when you do not know where your missiles go ?
- What's he getting at ?
- He's referring to the rocket that almost hit Juarez.
But that was a captured German V-2.
It happened nearly 10 years ago.
What is 10 years, senor ?
You still do not know where your missiles go.
He has the whole story, sir.
The low-flying projectile you lost over Argentina last year... and the Apex missile that disappeared last week.
That is so, senor captain.
Where are they, eh ?
As if I knew. If they're not up there, they must be down here.
Glad you're here, Commander.
Meet Sr. Ramon DeGareara, consul for Mexico at Santa Fe.
Mr. Harold Atkins, State Department.
Commander Prescott.
Mr. Atkins.
It seems that His Excellency, the minister for social services... was opening a new bull ring in San Pedro...
Senores, it was the moment of truth.
A great silence descend upon the crowd... 5,000 people.
10,000 eyes, senor comandante, fixed on the blade.
When suddenly there is a roar from space.
It was greater than the roar of the "oles" that would greet the final triumph.
All of the eyes look up.
And when they looked down...
- He missed the kill.
- Of course !
Suddenly there is a tremendous...Crrrrrrr!
The crowd scatter.
The bull is scared, jump over the barrera, nearly into the lap of His Excellency.
Then the bull escaped... and wrecked the market.
They found what was left of Y-13 tail section later on in the day.
Y-13 ? How soon can we get a salvage crew down there ?
I'm afraid it's not quite as simple as that.
There are formalities and compensations.
Si, senores.
Here is a list, senor captain, but, uh, it's not complete.
20,000 pesos !
Must have been the bull of the century.
Senor captain, it was a bull... worthy of Manolete himself.
Senor Consul, I hope you will cooperate by allowing us to salvage the tail section.
- I will use my personal influence.
- Thank you.
And the United States government will see about adequate compensation.
Please impress upon His Excellency that both our countries will benefit... from permission to send a salvage crew onto the crash site... at the earliest possible moment.
Of course, senor captain.
Well, uh, buenos dias, senores.
Buenos dias.
Buenos dias.
Oh, and, uh, captain...
I hope the next time you lose a missile... you shoot it in some other direction.
Boy ! We free a dozen missiles every week.
Because something goes wrong once in a while, this kind of thing has to happen.
Now, look, Chuck.
Wilson's just called.
Things are getting pretty serious.
There have been three more killings.
- Three ?
- Yeah.
- Did he give any details ?
- Mm-hmm.
A truck driver at a roadside diner just outside Los Alamos... and an elderly couple out by Green Valley.
Green Valley ? Why, that's...
How is it traveling those distances in such a short space of time ?
It can drive.
Wilson found a truck with a steering column and foot controls bent so far out of shape... it can't be driven another yard.
Ah. I'm beginning to get a picture.
We know it has great strength... it's clumsy, smashes everything it touches... and it has mechanical knowledge.
What makes you think this has anything to do with Y-13 ?
I'd like to have you look at something in the lab.
Excuse me.
- Captain Richards.
- Commander Larsen, sir.
The S-21 rocket motor is ready on test bed number two.
- We free in 30 minutes.
- Hold it.
- How long you gonna need me ?
- I'll make it as fast as I can.
Delay your test by one hour.
Fire at 1730.
But, sir, we're all set !
Look, it's about time you boys realized there's more than one baby in this nursery.
Delay your test till 1730.
I can give you 30 minutes.
Let's go.
Assuming that there is life in outer space... it would have to create a protective coating... in order to survive those destructive elements up there.
You mean, like the primeval creatures that crawled out of the sea... and grew skin to protect themselves against the sun ?
Yes. Y-13 has penetrated a new world.
So this coating was formed on Y-13... to protect it from those destructive forces in space.
It's an interesting theory, but I don't...
But suppose the same thing happened in the cockpit.
Let me show you something.
This.
If you notice, this is flexible and... harmless to touch.
Let me demonstrate on this piece of sponge rubber here.
I'll wrap this around my hand.
Now watch this.
Holy cow !
If this were a human throat, that's how it could be slashed.
Look closely into these gashes.
Meteorite dust.
The same as in the wounds of all the victims... meteorite dust.
So, there's only one interpretation
I can put on all this.
This... monster... kills... but only because, for some reason or other, it needs this blood.
No one has seen it and lived.
What are you getting at, Chuck ?
I'm afraid this monster is Dan.
- Say, that guy's off course.
- Yeah, he's loaded, okay.
Here we go.
Hold on.
I'm gonna take him !
Okay. I'll handle it.
Dan's metabolism must have changed.
But what form has it taken ?
Without knowing the kind of cosmic rays to which Dan was subjected... and their effect on the physical basis of life...
I couldn't say.
Perhaps it caused a blood change.
Boy !
It's incredible to think of your brother as a blood-drinking m...
Tia, would you get Dan's metabolism charts and cardiograms ?
We're gonna need your help.
Yes, l-l-I have them all here.
Suppose when the canopy burst... his blood absorbed a high content of nitrogen.
Then he would die.
The human body cannot survive a rarified atmosphere... without the protection of space suits and pressurized cabins.
But you're forgetting about that protective coating on Y-13.
- And if it formed quickly enough on Dan...
- Yes, it might have kept him alive.
And if, instead of death, a new metabolism was created... which starved his body and his brain of blood... what then ?
We know very little.
Only that by some mysterious means the cells controlling growth and reproduction... are changed by exposure to some cosmic rays.
Beyond that, I could only guess.
Yes, I'm only guessing too, Doctor.
But I think Dan would be more at home in space... than on Earth.
What has been going on hasn't been wanton killing... but only his need to replace this blood that has been changed.
He would need some proper transfusions.
It would be useless to drink it.
Yes, unless he was obeying some animalistic instinct.
Your hunch was right, Commander.
- Look at this.
- It's Dan's space helmet.
- Where'd you find it ?
- Not too far from here.
In a car with his latest victim.
And now we know what he looks like... a great big, lumbering, deformed monster.
It seems you can't kill him.
The bullets bounce off.
It's the coating.
It's a perfect protection, like armor plate.
I've assigned a platoon of marines to help Wilson.
Look, I... I know he's gotta be stopped, but... remember, he's still
Lieutenant Prescott, and... and if he can drive a car, he still retains some intelligence.
He's not all monster.
Well, what do you suggest ? We just let him roam the state, killing at random ?
No, Chief, that's not what I meant !
Well, look, we've got the works on him.
Next time we fight him, we'll try tear gas first.
If that doesn't work, let the marines blast him.
Stands to reason, Chuck.
If we can't stop him, we gotta destroy him.
I know, I know.
In the meantime,
I gotta talk to Washington.
Doctor, can you take me to your office ?
I wanna get a long-distance conference line open.
Of course, Captain.
Come with me.
I'd like you along, Chief.
Chuck, why did this have to happen ?
Tia, we're conquering a new world.
The dangers have to be faced.
Someone has to start.
- But why Dan ?
- Who could stop him ?
I couldn't, even though I tried.
You couldn't either.
No, I couldn't.
No, though you were right about one thing.
It was a piece of machinery that I wanted in the cockpit of Y-13, not Dan.
It is hard to remember sometime that people matter more than machines.
It is...
Well, he can't breathe !
In there !
Stop fringe ! Leave him alone !
Get out of here and warn the others to stay away from him !
We've got to get to von Essen, tell him to open up a high-altitude chamber.
Come on.
- Where's your nearest P.A. system ?
- Reception hall.
You'd better get to von Essen.
I'll stick with Dan. Go on.
Dan ! Dan, listen to me !
It's Chuck !
Listen, I tried to...
Attention, everyone !
Do not leave your offices !
Don't go into the corridor ! Your life is in danger if you go into the corridor !
Dr. Von Essen, he's going the wrong way.
Try and direct him on the P.A. system.
I'll follow him.
Captain, why don't you let me call my men and blast him ?
Forget it.
I'll take full responsibility.
Dan, listen to me !
You are in the wrong corridor.
Remember the building.
From the reception hall you should turn right.
Do not go straight on.
Turn right !
Dan, you have come a long way to find me... and I am very near.
If you are following my directions correctly... you will be approaching a staircase... leading to the high-altitude chamber... where I am waiting for you.
Remember, you must turn left onto the staircase.
If you are on the staircase... you are almost there.
Dan, try hard to remember.
The chamber is at the end of the corridor... leading straight from the bottom of the staircase.
Take your time, Dan.
I'm here in the high-altitude chamber... waiting to help you.
Come straight into the chamber.
He's coming this way.
Captain, open the door to the chamber.
- Larsen ?
- Yes, Doctor ?
Take Mr. Wilson over to the atmosphere controls.
Get as many recorders in operation as you can.
Look out, skipper !
With those hands he'll never be able to connect the inside controls.
- I'm going in.
- Chuck, you can't !
- I've got to.
- Chuck !
- Dr. Von Essen, can you hear me ?
- Yes, Chuck.
Start altering atmosphere immediately.
- Take it up as high and as fast as you can.
- All right, Chuck.
Proceed, Larsen.
Open inlet valve.
Allow for rise to 30,000 feet in 60 seconds.
It's being done, Chuck.
Dan. Dan, it's Chuck.
Your brother. Don't you know me ?
Chuck. We want to...
We want to help you.
We want to help you, Dan.
Dan.
Dan, don't you know me ?
Chuck !
It's Chuck !
Don't you know me ?
Ch... Ch-Chuck ?
Dan, we're trying to help you.
Sit down in the pilot's seat.
Sit down !
That's right. 
Back up.
Easy.
Sit down in the pilot's seat.
Back up. 
Back up down at...
That's right.
Dr. Von Essen, get me some oxygen, quick.
All right, Chuck.
Dan.
Listen.
Dr. Von Essen is here.
He wants to help you.
Dan,
I'm here at the window.
Dr. Von Essen.
Doctor ?
I've been searching for you.
Everything seems strange and dark.
I c-couldn't find you !
Tell me about it, Dan.
If I know what's happened,
I can help you.
Under this stuff...
I feel like I'm suffering from some terrible disease... like I've got no blood in my veins.
But the rarified atmosphere we are giving you, it helps ?
Like clean, fresh air.
I can breathe and think again.
We're up to 30,000 feet.
Can Chuck take any more ?
Be still, Chuck.
Don't exert yourself.
Take it very steadily up to 38,000 feet, but no more.
Go on, Dan.
There's not much to tell.
I have no memory.
Only an instinct to stay alive... until I found you.
I've been groping my way... through a maze of fear and doubt.
We're steady at 38,000.
Hold it there.
Dan, to find out what's wrong with you...
I must make metabolism and blood pressure tests.
All right, Doctor.
Dan, can you tell us what happened up there in space ?
It was like running into the tail end of a hurricane... only it was a stream of meteorite dust we hit.
At first it was like
50,000 machine guns... all hammering at once.
First the canopy... and then my... my visor melted.
I thought my blood was starting to boil.
Then this coating started to form... fast, cooling and protective.
But it was too late.
The last thing I remember was... pressing the button of the nose ejector.
Then I... I thought I died.
How high did you go, Dan ?
About 250 miles.
Maybe 300.
I don't know.
Chuck, did you hear that ?
Yeah, Dan. I'm listening.
You thought I was kidding... when I said I'd bring back all the dope you wanted.
Well, I've got it all.
With a covering of this stuff...
Y-14 will be able to go through that meteorite dust... straight up... l-It will be able to... go on... forever.
Rest, Dan. Rest.
He can't breathe.
Take it higher.
Chuck, i-it's no good.
I'm finished.
We shall take him higher.
But if we do, we'll kill Chuck.
- Tia.
- Yes, Dan ?
I'm sorry things had to happen this way.
But, you see, I...
I just... had to be... the first man... into space.
Neutralize atmosphere !
Right, Captain. Open the door.
No, Tia.
- Take care of Dan, will you ?
- Sure, sure.
There's nothing we can do.
You know, Doctor... this is the part of my job I dread.
Y-13 cost Dan his life.
And we go ahead with Y-14 soon.
I wonder if we've learned enough.
The conquest of new worlds always makes demands on human life.
And there will always be men who will accept the risks.
Kimo, you have committed the greatest crime of all.
You have betrayed your own people.
You have caused the death of your own father, once our mighty chief!
For these sins you must die!
Tano, you know lam innocent!
My father died from the Black Plague.
Lies will not save you!
The devil dust of your American friends killed our great chief, killed many of our people!
Tano, you fear the Americans because their medicine is stronger than yours!
They come here as our friends to help us!
Friends'?
Why didn't the Americans heal your father?
You all know I was his father's best friend.
I begged our great chief, do not listen to the false voices of the strangers.
Listen to Tano, the wise one!
His medicine will make you strong and well again.
My father was sick and out of his mind with fever!
Tano gave him the poison because you wanted to become the new chief!
You and Tano are the guilty ones! You should die!
The evil spirits have seized Kimo's mind!
- His tongue has become a serpent.
- I tell the truth!
Ask my wife Korey.
She was caring for my father when Tano and Maranka came with the poison!
- What is it you wish me to say, Kimo?
- The truth!
Tell them the truth, that Tano and Maranka gave him the evil medicine that killed him!
What medicine, my husband?
The only thing he drank was the medicine you brought from the American doctor.
Do you hear the truth from the wife of the guilty one?
You broke the law of our tribe when you brought your father to the Americans!
It was their fiendish, unholy devil dust that made him sick!
Their medicine that killed him!
For that you must die!
Korey, why have you betrayed me?
I will come back from the grave to revenge for myself.
Tano!
You can kill my body, but my spirit will never die!
In death I will be stronger than you in life!
Maranka, your days are numbered.
May the gods curse you and Tano and Korey!
I promise you all,
I shall come back from hell and make you pay for your crimes!
How come the travel posters never mention the drums?
Islands of romance.
Islands of beauty.
How come they never talk about the malaria and the jungle rots, the fever and the heat, the stupid blind ignorance, and those drums?
Yes, that propaganda they feed the innocent tourist is enough to drive a man to drink.
If I ever go back to the States, which seems unlikely,
I'll become a research chemist in a distillery, and combine business with pleasure.
You better lay off that stuff, Professor.
You'll wake up in the morning with a hangover, but the drums will still be here.
Drums don't bother me, Doc.
As a matter of fact, they have a nice anthropological beat.
Well, maybe we oughta record it, get it on the hit parade.
All kidding aside, those drums sound like trouble.
Trouble for us, I'm afraid.
Ever since the old chief died, the natives have been staring at us with hate in their eyes.
I tried to save his life, but the old chief was too far gone from that brew of bacteria the witch doctor fed him.
By the time I got there, he was paralyzed, practically dead.
I know.
You did your best, Doc.
No need to be nervous.
Ordinarily, the natives on this island are peaceful enough.
You mean they were peaceful enough until they dropped that atom bomb on the Nogassa Atoll.
Fifteen hundred miles from here.
Who would have thought that a freak typhoon could come out of nowhere and wreck all calculations.
Well, the facts remain that the atomic fallout landed here and that we trusty scientists from the International Foundafion came running with our little
Geiger counters to investigate.
What did we find? Plague!
That's what's killing off the natives. It's not the fallout.
A little knowledge is a dangerous thing.
You know, they heard about the fallout from the sailors on the boats that trade with the islands.
They think of it as some kind of "devil dust".
A curse brought along by the evil Americans.
We know that's so much eye wash.
We've checked the radiation on this island, it's only 3.05 roentgen.
Hardly any more than an ordinary dental X-ray.
Sure, reason's on our side, but they don't seem to be buying it.
I'll tell you who poisons their simple minds.
It's Tano, their witch doctor.
He's afraid of losing his patients to modern medicine.
Wants to keep them steeped in their centuries old superstitions.
They worship him like some kind of high priest.
Back in the States they don't regard doctors that way.
Sometimes they don't even pay their bills.
I know what's on your mind.
It's written all over you.
You'd like to go back home, wouldn't you?
Is it that evident?
Sure, I'd go back tomorrow, only...
Only you'd like to take a bride with you and the girl says "no".
Terry Mason's doing a great job on Baku Island.
I don't think the Foundation would want to lose her.
Why did I have to fall in love with a dedicated female scientist?
She considers marriage some kind of prison.
What do you expect from a pretty girl two years out of med coflege?
She wants excitement, adventure.
She thinks of routine as a middle age thing.
There are sometimes I could kick her beautiful teeth in.
Here I offer her the earth, the moon, the stars... and she prefers test tubes and a tiny Pacific atoll.
Forget her!
Find somebody else.
I've tried!
Dozens of times.
Well?
There's nothing like a cup of your battery acid to pep you up.
Only it needs a little more acid.
Generator 3 was acting up.
Luckily, I caught it just in time.
All I can say is Jones and Pierce sure picked a good time to to go over to Taenga Atoll with Reverend Cameron.
They could've give me a hand.
Ah, coffee?
That's a very good idea.
It'll taste better if you put a little iodine in it.
I better drink it before it melts the spoon.
Doc! Eddie! It's Mrs. Kilgore!
I warned her never to leave the trading post during one of the native ceremonies.
- Eddie, take her to the lab.
- Okay, Doc.
- Eddie, get me a wet towel.
- Check.
Oh, save me, save me, help me!
Easy, Mrs. Kilgore, easy.
Relax, your perfectly safe.
You're among friends.
Oh, it's awful. I was there.
I saw them kill Kimo.
The bloomin' cannibals. They stuck a knife right in his heart.
It was horrible, simply horrible!
And that native outside, he'd liked to have killed me if he could.
You're all right now, Mrs. Kilgore.
No one's going to hurt you.
I'll have nightmares the rest of me natural life. The heathens.
They ought to drop a bloomin' hydrogen bomb on 'em all
- and blow 'em to pieces.
- Now, Mrs. Kilgore try to control yourself.
Don't be stingy at a time like this, Deary.
My goodness, I must look ghastly in front of you gentlemen.
There's nothing else I can do now. If you want me, I'll be in the radio room.
Mrs. Kilgore?
You passed a cemetery during a native ceremony.
That's why they sent a man out to try to kill you.
Why, I just had to see you,
Doctor.
I ran out of that ducky medicine you gave me for my nerves.
Doctor, you can't imagine the lonely life of a widow.
Two husbands I've buried, and now their's no one to care for me.
Well, if we hadn't heard you scream, Mrs. Kilgore, we might be burying you beside your latest lamented husband.
Well, I just couldn't stand those drums.
Gave me a terrible case of the jitters.
Oh, that horrible brute.
I think he hit me.
Doctor, wouldn't you like to examine me, see if I've suffered any injuries?
Mrs. Kilgore, you appear to be in excellent shape.
I'm afraid you're more frightened, than hurt.
Seems like every place you go on this bloomin' island you break a tribal law or something.
Soon as I find a buyer for the trading post,
I'm taking off for
Australia like a bird.
I'm going to open a little tea shop.
After two years in this bloomin' rat hole,
I think I'll open a pub instead.
Well, until you do leave,
Mrs. Kilgore,
I advise you to give the natives a wide berth.
Well, I like that!
My poor Eddie and me, we opened the trading post to help these unfortunate people.
And you made a nice profit trading beads and knives in exchange for copper and the occasional pearls.
Now that's not a nice thing to say.
I bet you're getting paid handsomely by that International Atomic
"whatsit" that sent you here!
I don't know why you want to study those natives for anyway.
Mrs. Kilgore, I'm afraid you don't understand them the way the good professor does.
He considers them civilized in their own delightful primitive way.
Why, he'll tell you a human sacrifice is no worse than a traffic accident.
I still don't know why they killed Kimo.
Such a nice polite fellow.
Good looking too.
He committed the crime of learning something about modern science.
He wanted to help his people.
And for that they killed him.
Terrible thing.
He was our one link with the natives.
Our one chance to lick the plague.
Well, whether they like it or not, we've got to stop this epidemic.
Once we do that, they'll trust us again.
Of course, I'm not educated like you two but it doesn't take much brains to see there's all kinds of strange things going on on this island.
You're right about that,
Mrs. Kilgore.
As a matter of fact I think we could use some more help to study the situation.
I'll mention that now in my report to Washington.
Terry.
Oh, Bill...
Oh, your pulse needs to be steadied.
You seem to be running a fever.
At times like this a violent chemical reaction sets in.
May I prescribe a cold shower?
Oh, I've already had one.
We have our own shower.
We built it out of the finest rusty pipe we could find.
Sounds like real luxury.
Oh, Terry, you remember
Eddie, don't you?
He worked in Baku for awhile.
Eddie!
- Sure.
- Hello, Eddie.
Good to see you again, Dr. Mason.
- Can I get your bags?
- Yes, Please. Thanks Eddie.
Terry, this isn't fair.
I won't be able to keep my mind on my work with you here.
I wish they'd sent somebody else.
Then, this isn't your doing?
You mean having you ordered here?
Oh, you know howl feel about you, Terry.
This is a danger spot.
- A little plague doesn't worry me.
- Ah, something worse.
See that?
Their witch doctor's got them all stirred up.
Terry, why don't you go back to Baku.
Have them send somebody else.
I've never dodged an assignment yet, Bill.
Dr. Falkner and Dr. Curly are my bosses.
I can take orders only from them.
Well...
Okay, let's go.
Welcome to the island of forgotten scientists, Terry.
You can imagine how pleased we were when
Washington radioed you're on the way.
Oh, thank you. Professor, it's so good to see you.
How's the work going?
Fine. I think you'll find our tests very interesting.
Well, I'm sure I will.
We can talk shop later.
- I'm sure you want to unpack first anyway.
- Well...
I'm doing some work in the lab and I'll see you at lunch.
Give me all the Foundation gossip from Baku.
Professor, it'll be a pleasure.
Oh... Terry, this is Mrs. Kilgore.
She runs the trading post
They told me a lady doctor was coming, but I figured it would be one of them beanpole spinsters.
Well, I'm a spinster all right, Mrs. Kilgore.
But you ain't no beanpole, that's for certain.
My, that's a lovely suit.
Why thank you. I bought it on my last trip to Hawaii.
Mmmm, that perfume smells real nice.
That come from Hawaii too?
No, I brought that from the States.
It's Arpege and I have an extra bottle if you'd like one.
Why that's right nice of you, Ducky.
I mean, Dr. Mason.
Why that's all right, Mrs. Kilgore.
You needn't be so formal.
You call me Ducky or Docky or anything you want to.
I will, Deary.
And you call me Meg.
Oh, uh...Ducky?
- Yes, Ducky.
- We've got your quarters ready.
Mrs. Kilgore will take you over.
I'll drop by later and pick you up.
I knew you'd be tired from the trip, Ducky, so I got a native girl to help you.
Oh, I thought Dr. Arnold said the natives were angry with us outsiders.
The tribe considers Orchid an outcast.
She's the girl I got for you.
And being an outcast she's not subject to tribal law.
Her mother was a native, but her father was Dutch.
When her parents died, she was raised by Reverend Cameron, the missionary.
- You want these bags now, Dr. Mason?
- Yes, please. Thanks, Eddie.
Come along, Deary.
Oh, Terry?
Yes...
I'm glad you stayed.
Thanks.
I hope that you'll like it here.
Oh, it's very nice,
I'm sure I will.
- Orchid, this is Dr. Mason.
- Hello, Orchid.
Eddie, I wonder if you can take me back to my quarters?
- I'd be glad to, Mrs. Kilgore.
- Oh, wait a minute, Meg.
Mustn't forget that perfume
I promised you.
Thanks, Deary.
Eddie, we'd better be going.
- See you later.
- All right.
Why do they call you Orchid?
Because they say I'm wild, like our flowers.
I'm glad that they picked me to be your servant.
Maybe I can earn money to go to other island, where they will not care that I am an outcast.
Then maybe I will marry.
- Are you married?
- No.
Perhaps if I were, I may not have come here.
Orchid, how do you come to speak such good English?
The Reverend Cameron taught me how.
He's been like a father to me.
- You certainly learned it well.
- Thank you.
You know, I think we'll get along fine.
Terry, are you ready?
I thought I'd show you around the lab before lunch.
Hey, you're early.
I see you're enjoying our luxury.
It's wonderful!
I'll be over as soon as I'm dressed.
Okay-
Norgu.
I'm glad to see you.
After Tano's orders forbidding the natives to come here
I thought I'd never see you again.
I was Kimo's best friend.
I think the same way he did.
That you have come to help our people.
Tano could do nothing for my wife Dori.
He does not know how to fight the plague sickness, nor the marks on her face.
Dori, sit here.
Ah, your face shows improvement.
You are healing her, Doctor.
Others in the village know you have chased away the evil spirits with your medicine.
Nargu, this plague is very serious.
Talk to as many of your people as you dare and get them to come here for treatment in spite of the danger.
Tano has no medicine to cure the plague.
There are many who do not trust you since Kimo's father died, Doctor.
But it was Tano who gave him the poison medicine.
Kimo said that too, before they killed him.
I believe it, but others do not.
Well, Dr. Mason.
This is Dori.
I'd like you to look at her.
She's recovering from the plague, but seems to have suffered a slight radiation burn also.
Had she a history ofjungle rot or dermatitis before the fallout came?
She had a history of eczema.
It seemed to be almost cured before the fallout landed here.
Before the former chief died and son was killed, the natives came to us for treatment.
However, the new chief, Maranka, and his witch doctor Tano, forbid the natives to come here.
Those who do are taking their lives in their hands.
From the look of the scar tissue it seems to be responding to your treatment.
Terry!
You specialize in dermatology and the removal of excessive scar tissue.
Have you any ideas?
It would help our situation with the natives if we could speed up a recovery.
Let's try formula X-37. We had some good results on Baku with It.
We can begin treatment soon as the supplies are unpacked.
Terry, I hear that your group on Baku have rebuilt human tissue destroyed by jungle rot.
Yes, we had some luck, I guess.
Let's hope your luck holds out.
Dori, come back tomorrow and we'll try Dr.
Mason's new medicine.
I will bring her. Thank you.
I'm glad you have confidence in Dr. Arnold, Norgu.
He's a good man.
Not evil, like Tano!
Come, Dori.
Our progress with these natives is very slow, Terry.
Their superstitions are so deep rooted.
Yes, I know.
Well, where's that lunch you promised me?
You're looking at the best
French chef on this island.
And wait until you taste his coffee.
It was for you that I helped kill Kimo, my husband.
And since he died the fire of your love has grown cold.
I could never have a traitor like you as my wife.
Get out of here!
I know that you make those poison darts to kill the Americans.
You are afraid of them.
You throw me out so that you can make love to Naomi.
You come from her hut many times.
I picked the poison berries for you.
We have enough, Naomi.
We will go now.
This could be for you, just as easily as for the Americans.
Here you are, Terry.
Nature's own flower shop.
Orchids, Hibiscus, you name them, we have them.
Thanks, Bill.
It's very lovely.
Almost as lovely as you are.
I'm gonna fill your head every morning with jungle flowers.
That's one of the advantages of living in this primitive area.
You can give your girl a fortune in flowers, and it doesn't cost a cent.
Terry...
Bill, Dear. I'm not your girl, or anybody's girl.
Why do you have to be so stubborn?
Why don't you admit you love me?
Then, when Reverend
Cameron comes back, he can marry us and we can go back to the States and live like normal people.
Depends on what you call normal.
Being couped up in a stuffy apartment having my ears blasted by rock & roll music isn't my idea of normal.
Rock & Roll? Wait until you hear the native drums. They'll really rock you.
Terry, what do you want out of life?
Do you wanna go from one assignment to another, out here on the islands, like the Professor?
Do you want to go through life alone?
Don't you want a husband, children, like other women?
You do love me, don't you?
Admit it.
I don't love you.
Then Why'd you kiss me back?
I don't know.
My metabolism.
It was unconscious, involuntary.
Terry, will you stop being a doctor first and a woman second.
Let your emotions rule you, not your intellect.
Bill, I live by my intellect, reason.
If I let my emotions run away,
I wouldn't be any good in my work.
Bill, isn't that the native cemetery that Orchid was telling me about?
That's where they buried Kimo.
Oh, the one Mrs. Kilgore saw murdered.
The one with the knife in his heart.
His grave should be somewhere over there.
- I'd like to see it.
- Hmm?
- Oh, it's taboo territory?
- Un huh.
Well, who's afraid of the local medicine man?
Strange. An odd looking stump.
Seems to be breaking the ground round the grave.
Could it be a growth from the roots of another tree?
I don't know.
We better get Clark out here to look at it.
He's an expert on jungle trees and plants.
Well, it isn't very likely that a tree or the stump of one would sprout out of a grave.
It'd have to penetrate a six foot coffin.
Orchid says Kimo was buried in a six foot coffin.
Could a tree trunk grow out of a coffin?
Who knows? Science doesn't have all the answers, yet.
It's probably the malformed growth of a tropical bush.
Nothing particularly unusual about that.
Professor, that's not a bush!
No, it's a tree all right.
Don't tell me that matured stumps come ready made from the ground.
The next thing you know...
Hello, Nargu.
Nargu, what is it?
Kimo's curse has come through.
His spirit returns from the grave!
- You mean this?
- Yes.
Nargu, I thought you didn't believe in that witch doctor hocus pocus.
I have heard of stories like this from my grandfather who was storyteller of the tribe.
Oh, you mean it's a legend, a made up story?
No!
No, it's the truth.
Years ago, one of our great chiefs was murdered by his enemies.
He was buried with seeds.
He came back to life as a tree monster.
Tree monster!
Oh, now Norgu, I know about cannibalistic flowers, but this tree monster is utterly unbelievable.
Dr. Mason, you are wise lady, but there are many things even the wisest of us do not know.
This tree monster was torn loose from the ground by a bolt of lightning.
It roamed the island.
Killed many people.
They called it...
Tabanga!
Tabanga, what does that mean?
- Creature of revenge.
- What happened to this monster?
It just disappeared one day, never came back.
Some say it walked into the quicksand at the edge of the forest.
No one knew for sure.
I just came from Mrs. Kilgore, by way of the cemetery.
I happened to pass Kimo's grave.
There's a strange growth from the ground.
It has a ceremonial dagger in it's heart.
See, Kimo's coming back!
It looks so terrible, with green stuff coming from it.
Like green blood from a dying man.
Well, obviously there's something there.
We'd better go and investigate it.
You're right, Howard. There is an irregular heart beat
Terry, give me the reading.
This tallies with the lateral pulse. It's a human heart beat!
What do you make of that green ooze?
Probably the equivalent of blocd, the stuff that keeps it alive.
Let's take a sample.
Stand back!
Geiger reading gets high,
...on 65!
Radioactive material in this thing!
The Tabanga will soon remove itself from the ground.
You mean this wooden zombie's going to uproot itself from the earth?
Your grandfather must have been quite a storyteller.
Please Professor, if this one is like the other
Tabanga, you must destroy it at once.
I beg you, pull up the roots so it will die before it murders everyone.
Maybe you could throw it into the quicksand at the edge of the forest.
Norgu, what you fear is scientifically impossible.
You know what, I have an eerie feeling that this thing knows what we're saying.
Professor, this is the reply from your message to Washington.
"Request you remove growth."
"Make thorough laboratory analysis."
"Have Arnold and Mason determine influence of radiation, if any."
"Radio detailed report."
"Mail photos as soon as possible." "Falkner"
Well, that's that.
Better get busy.
Thank you, Eddie.
Well, the first thing to do is go out and dig up the monster, and bring it to the lab.
That won't be easy. The roots probably go quite deep.
Yeah, we'll probably have to separate each root at soil level and seal it with stitches.
I imagine the natives are in an uproar.
Like Nargu, they probably feel the monster is another Tabanga.
If moving that monster violates another tribal law, we'll be in for it.
You know we're greatly outnumbered here.
They could easily overpower us.
And don't forget what Nargu said about it being taboo for strangers to go near the Tabanga.
Well, I say let's get started.
And I say let's throw it in the quicksand. Forget about it.
Well, they blame us for everything as it is. This could be the final straw.
Where's your scientific curiosity, Doctor?
Anyway, Washington wants us to investigate it, so let's take a risk and see what happens.
Professor, Bill is worried about me.
Now look, Bill. I can handle a gun if the occasion arises.
Remember, we're both working for the Foundation.
Well, I see I'm out voted.
All right, if you people feel like chopping wood, I don't mind a little exercise.
Let's go get the choppers.
Nargu has disobeyed the taboo at the
Americans. He must die with them.
Nargu has many friends in the tribe.
- We must be careful.
- I say he must die.
In good time.
First...
I will spread this powerful medicine at the base of the new Tabanga.
It will go to the roots...
Tabanga will become my servant and will kill when I tell it to!
Nargu will be it's victim!
I will place the medicine on the Tabanga.
The 4th day after 2 full moons... so has the spirit told me.
You'll remember, Tano,
Korey must also die.
Nargu, isn't this Korey, the wife of your dead friend, Kimo?
You are Chief Maranka's woman.
What do you come here for?
He no longer loves me.
He would take Naomi to be his wife.
Korey, are you trying to tell us something?
Yes, Tano and Maranka are planning to kill all of you.
Also Nargu.
You're breaking the Chief's taboo by coming here, isn't that true?
I know it.
- And yet you came here to warn us?
- Yes.
How do we know this isn't some kind of trick?
You do not trust me.
I don't blame you.
Did Nargu tell you I betrayed
Kimo and caused his death?
No, Nargu said nothing about that.
They are evil, Tano and
Maranka, both of them.
They want to become gods of the island.
That is why they want to drive you out, and all others who stand in their way.
- Are you in their way, as we are?
- Yes
They want to kill me, too.
Please let me stay here with you.
You think we can trust her, Nargu?
You can trust Korey.
Even though she lied once,
I think now she tells the truth.
All right, you can stay here with Orchid.
You'd better get Dori and stay in the compound too.
Monster must be uprooted and brought here tonight.
Make as little noise as possible.
We don't want to alert the natives.
Bill, you dig there.
Terry, you and I will sever the roots as he exposes them.
Hold the light, will you, Eddie?
Pulse beat is almost human.
Maybe we ought to ship it back to the States.
Makes a great scarecrow.
He reminds me of a chemistry prof I had at med school.
Bill, during the operation, your arm accidentally brushed the knife in it's heart.
- Ah, I didn't notice.
- I could have sworn it moved.
Almost as if it were in pain.
The pulse is weak.
It's dying!
The pulse is getting weaker!
It's dying on us!
Probably a stoppage in the circulation somewhere.
Maybe a clot in the aorta.
Well, we've done everything we can.
There's nothing more we can do.
Looks as if it will stop beating altogether in a few minutes.
Good! I'm all for throwing it in the quicksand. Let it return to it's ancestors.
Couldn't we try to energize the adrenal gland with an electrode resistor?
How much energy would you need?
I've read of experiments where they used 750 amps and a 1,000 volts.
Our generators can't give us that much power.
Look, why keep this freak of nature alive?
Your interest in it is morbid!
Bill, it's purely scientific!
And if you weren't so concerned with your natives, and their silly taboos, you'd be helping us.
Not standing by doing nothing.
I know what, why don't we psychoanalyze the monster?
Maybe it's mother was scared by an oak tree.
Oh, Bill. Why won't you be serious.
Look, Terry... we came down here to treat people with the plague and those maybe suffering from atomic fallout.
I'm no tree surgeon.
Does this mean you two geniuses can't figure out the answer?
Oh, I've got the answer.
Let's pack our frozen faced friend in a box and send it back to Dr. Falkner.
Maybe he can use it in his office as a clothes tree.
Case closed!
You two may consider this case closed, but this is an entirely new specie of life, and as long as there's life in it, I'm going to work on it.
Formula 447? Is this something you've been working on at Baku?
I've experimented with monkeys and parrots who've been exposed to a dangerous amount of radiation.
This formula has achieved miraculous results in re-creating heart action.
Have you experimented with human beings?
Afraid I'm years away from that phase of the work, Bill.
Works very slowly. Takes several hours to show any effect.
I want to try some on our wooden friend here.
I have a few hundred cc's right with me.
What do you think, Bill?
Well, the monsters almost dead.
Terry wants to waste her time on it, it's all right with me.
Thanks. Will you help me with an intravenous injection?
You've never experimented with anything this large before, would you like to check your calculations?
There isn't time, the thing's dying.
We have to trust my calculations. It's now or never.
All right, all right. We'll do it just the way you want.
Thank you, Dr. Arnold. Now, will you hook up the IV bottle while I mix the formula?
I will be delighted.
Pulse is the same, no stronger, no weaker.
- Bottles almost empty.
- Want me to take the tube out?
Yes, thanks, Bill.
What do we do now, Terry, sit up with the dying patient?
No, I don't think that'll be necessary.
My experiments show it requires at least
8 hours for the formula to take affect.
Might as well all get a good night's sleep and meet here at six o'clock in the morning.
- That I heartily approve of.
- Six o'clock!
- The monster!
- It's gone!
You must have administered too large an injection of your formula.
Came back to life sooner than you expected.
The reaction never took less than 8 hours.
I was so sure I figured correctly.
Well, you figured wrong this time, in spades.
Wait a minute, doctors.
You honestly believe that
Terry's formula brought the thing back to life and it ran away?
I don't know...
Terry, when you re-created heart action in those monkeys, did they suddenly have the strength of gorillas, tear the place apart?
No, it took days or weeks before they had strength to run around.
Well then, isn't it obvious who caused this destruction?
You mean, Tano and the other natives?
You think they came to get the Tabanga?
I'm afraid so.
And then after they were here, like angry children, they decided to smash our things.
I guess you're right,
Professor.
Holy mackerel!
You know,
I know this sounds crazy, but maybe the Tabanga is for real.
And if it is, we're gonna need help.
Eddie, radio Baku.
Doc! Professor!
Does this mean we're cut off from communication from the outside?
You've been hiding from me a long time.
I've been waiting for this chance.
You've stolen my man, now you must die!
Help! Help me!
The Tabanga!
Help meg
Help!
Help meg
Help!
I just saw the Tabanga!
Well, how do you know it was Tabanga?
Because it looked like a tree, it had eyes and hands and a knife was still in it's heart, like Kimo's.
- You have many loves.
- I'm only calming her fright.
She said she had seen the Tabanga.
- Where did you see it?
- In the forest, near the quicksand.
- You sure it was the Tabanga?
- I swear it!
We'll soon find out.
We will go to the cemetery!
This is dangerous.
The Tabanga's been taken out.
It was the Americans! They cut the roots to free the Tabanga!
- It will kill us all!
- Not if we kill it first.
We'll have our bravest men hunt it down and kill it!
As long as the Tabanga's free, we are all in danger.
After the Tabanga dies, then the Americans die!
Come, take me to where you saw the Tabanga.
Korey's gone! This is where I left her!
See, there's her knife!
See, this is Korey's too!
Tabanga must have thrown
Korey in the quicksand.
We must find the Tabanga!
- Where's Maranka?
- Killed, by the Tabanga.
Tano, why didn't you destroy the Tabanga with medicine?
Before I could get to it, the Americans had cut the roots and given it freedom.
Now the evil spirits in the Tabanga are too strong, it must be killed!
Hurry, we have no time to waste!
Orchid, what's wrong?
I just came from the village.
The Tabanga is not dead.
That can't be!
Tabanga came to the village and killed Maranka.
Does anybody know where the Tabanga is now?
Tano and his men are looking for it.
What is it?
The monster's still alive.
I knew my formula would work. I was right, Professor, wasn't I?
Yes, but I'm not sure how right I was to let you go ahead with it.
Orchid reports the
Tabanga's killed the chief.
Oh no, I...
I just wanted it to live.
Not to destroy.
Don't blame yourself, Terry.
The radiation dormant in the monster must have set off a chain reaction.
We've got to stop that monster before there's any more killing!
Isn't it strange, that of all the natives on the island, the monster got Maranka?
Tabanga spirit of revenge.
It killed Korey, Kimo's widow.
We've got to help these people.
It is dangerous for you to go.
Tano blames you for taking the Tabanga from the ground.
Orchid's right. With the Tabanga running amck, they'll kill anything in sight.
- Are the guns loaded?
- Yeah.
Kani, we've set our trap well.
Now we must be certain the
Tabanga will fall into this pit.
We know the Tabanga has threatened three lives,
Korey's, Maranka's, and mine.
So I am the next one he would kill!
Therefore, I'm the bait that must lead him to the trap!
Maku, climb a tree, signal me when you see it coming. I'll stand here.
The rest of you, stand behind the trees!
Tabanga comes!
Tabanga comes!
Now!
Tabanga will die.
Wait a minute, Doc.
This may be trouble.
Eddie!
See who's at the door.
Be ready to shoot.
Yes, sir.
Well, what do you want?
Come quick, please help us.
We can not kill the Tabanga.
We burned Tabanga with a mighty fire, but it didn't help.
It came out alive!
Please come before it kills us all!
Do you know where the
Tabanga is now?
Good. You two wait outside.
Thank heavens all of you are alive.
I thought I'd never see you again.
When Orchid told me about that horrible monster running amok,
I didn't dare leave my house.
An hour ago the natives ran past the house screaming and jabbering about the monster.
They said it was on the prowl.
You two girls stay here.
It's safer.
Oh, no. I'm going with you.
I won't stay here alone for minute with you men gone.
What if that horrible thing came back.
She's right. Obviously, locked doors mean nothing to the monster.
Well, I can't keep you back if you insist on tagging along.
Bring a gun for me, Eddie.
I don't know how to shoot one of the bloomin' things, but I'd feel safer with one also.
Make it two, Eddie.
Eddie, we should be able to pick up the trail if we can find any of that green ooze.
I'll keep my eyes open, Doc.
And I've looked for that green goop everywhere, everywhere I can think, and I haven't seen a sign of it.
I never would have thought of such a thing from Kimo.
Delightful fellow, really.
I know that you like the Doc, Deary, but I had a real liking for that
Kimo, and I had a thing going once.
Of course, he was much taller than I, but there's something about a tall man that I, well I don't know, you look up at him and he looks down at you, and I don't know, you just go on like that indefinitely.
Deary, island life is very pleasant, but there's nothing like a good pub.
There you sit with a gentleman every evening, drinking...
Help! Help!
Help! Help!
- What was that?
- It came from behind us.
Where's Terry?
I don't know.
I was talking to her and all of a sudden, poof, she disappeared.
You think that bloomin' monster got hold of her?
- We've got to find her.
- Let's go back. Come on!
Down there!
It's Terry!
You're the best shot, Eddie.
Have you got enough light to see?
This moonlight's good enough.
All right.
Try for that knife.
Maybe if you can hit that knife with the bullet it'll drive it clear through the monster's heart.
It has to turn to give me a crack at that knife, Doc.
Fire a few shots, maybe it'll turn around.
No effect on it at all.
- Try again.
- I'll aim above her.
Doc, I never saw anything like this.
Those bullets bounce off like
BB shot on a stone wall.
That knife's our only chance.
Now!
We know now,
American magic is better.
Maybe we need new medicine maker to replace Tano.
Will you be our witch doctor?
Maybe for a little while, Maku. Then perhaps we can teach some of your people.
Thank you.
Oh, Professor Clark, that was ever so thrilling.
And isn't nice you and the natives can be friends again.
Yes, it looks like a honeymoon and back to the States for them.
Ah, by the way, Professor,
I never asked you, are you married?

[ Man Narrating ]
This is Tokyo...
once a city of six million people.
What has happened here
was caused by a force...
which, up until a few days ago,
was entirely...
beyond the scope
of man's imagination.
Tokyo - a smoldering memorial
to the unknown...
an unknown which,
at this very moment, still prevails...
and could at any time lash out
with its terrible destruction...
anywhere else in the world.
There were once many people here
who could have told of what they saw.
Now there are only a few.
My name is Steve Martin.
I'm a foreign correspondent
for United World News.
I was headed
for an assignment in Cairo...
when I stopped off in Tokyo
for a social call.
But it turned out to be a visit
to the living hell of another world.
Emergency hospitals were overflowing
with the maimed and the dead.
For the living,
the horror of last night was over.
The only thought left
was the paralyzing fear...
that it could happen again today...
or tomorrow.
[ Geiger Counter Clicking ]
Everyone who had survived
without serious injury...
was helping to repair
the human wreckage.
One of the survivors
was Emiko Yamane...
the daughter of Japan's
famous paleontologist.
For some of the victims,
there was hope.
For others,
there would be no tomorrow.
[ Child Wailing ]
I don't know
how many hours went by...
before an auxiliary
hospital unit found me.
I knew it was daylight.
I was surprised to be alive.
The odor of scorched flesh
permeated the air.
The sight of all the helpless
human wreckage...
snapped me back to stark reality.
[ Wailing Continues ]
[ Woman Sobbing ]
Emiko. Emiko!
Steve. Steve Martin.
Are you badly hurt?
After last night,
I'm lucky to be alive.
I guess we're all living on borrowed time.
Oh, Steve, what brought this upon us?
I don't know, Emiko.
I don't know.
Your father - is he all right?
Yes. He's meeting with the security officials now.
[ Groans ]
Don't move, Steve.
I'll try to get a doctor for you.
[ Steve Narrating ]
It was still hard for me to believe...
that I could be lying here
in a hospital alive....
when I think of the thousands
of others dead and dying...
in the ruins around me.
When I think back,
only a few days ago...
I was en route to Cairo...
with a few days' layover in Tokyo.
I was looking forward to a visit
with an old college friend, Dr. Serizawa...
a theoretical scientist who was gaining
great recognition in the Far East...
for his unusual experiments.
While I was unaware
of it at the time...
10,000 feet below,
an incident was about to take place...
that would shake the foundations
of the civilized world. dd [ Ballad ]

[ Steve Narrating ] This morning,
it would have been impossible...
for anyone to convince me that I would
ever see Tokyo like this again.
- Pardon. You are Mr. Steve Martin?
- Yes.
I'm Shigeo Ioto, assistant to Dr. Serizawa.
Oh, how do you do?
And how is Serizawa?
His health is fine, but he regrets not being here to meet you.
Something wrong?
Dr. Serizawa had to go inland on some field experiments.
He wanted to delay them until after your visit... but they were much too important.
- He hopes that you understand.
- Of course.
- Oh, when's he planning to return?
- Perhaps before your departure to Cairo.
Meanwhile, if there's anything I can do, please feel free to call me.
I certainly will.
[ Japanese ]
[ Japanese ]
I'm sorry, Mr. Martin, but we must ask you... to come to the security office for questioning.
Is this a polite way of telling me I'm under arrest?
No, no arrest.
Just questioning.
- But it is imperative that you come.
- Of course.
I'll take your bag.
Hotel Mikasu?
No. Still the Imperial.
[ Man Over P.A. ]
Flight 104 is arriving at ramp seven.
[ Japanese ]
- How do you do, Mr. Martin?
- Mr. Iwanaga.
During your flight last night, did anything unusual occur?
Well, I didn't notice anything.
I was busy writing and reading, and the rest of the time I was sleeping.
Oh, I see.
I understand you've questioned everyone on my flight.
What is it you're trying to find out?
I represent United World News.
I don't know, Mr. Martin.
I don't know whether it should be printed or not.
I don't follow you.
You see, we don't know what it is we're dealing with.
At 3:30 this morning, a ship from Tokyo was literally wiped... from the surface of the ocean in a matter of seconds.
Anything from the ship's radio?
It said there was a blinding flash of light... and the ocean burst into flame.
Could have been a mine or a collision.
Why would the radio men not report a mine or a collision?
That's a good point.
Well, whatever's being done
I'd like to find out about.
All right.
Come with me.

This is the chart room of the Nankai Steamship Company.
It was their ship which was sunk.
[ Japanese ]
You mind telling me what they're discussing?
They're at a loss to explain how their ship could disappear so suddenly.
[ Japanese ]
- Any survivors?
- No, not yet.
They're in direct contact with the rescue ship now.
It should arrive at the scene of the sinking in a few hours.

Mr. George Lawrence,

[ Steve Narrating ]
The few survivors who had been found...

[ Crowd Clamoring ]
[ Japanese ]
With disaster following disaster,
the terror-stricken people...
demanded action be taken.
Security officials and scientists
were called together.
Dr. Yamane,
Japan's leading paleontologist...
was among the top scientists
invited to the meeting.
I had met Dr. Yamane through my friend
Serizawa several years ago.
If there was to be an answer
to these mysterious ship disasters...
it would come from these men.
[ Japanese ]
[ Man Speaking Japanese ]
[ Japanese ]
I'm afraid my Japanese is a little rusty.
[ Japanese ]
Dr. Yamane is suggesting to the officials... that they question the natives of a small island.
He says that Odo Island is close to the area... where the disasters have taken place.
[ Steve Narrating ]
Odo Island...
a bleak spot of land in the Pacific...
populated
with several hundred natives...
who were now
half paralyzed with fear.

While various natives
of the island...
were being interrogated
by the officials...
Tomo and I went out
among the natives.
[ Japanese ]
Hey, Tomo, we make him mad?
He's frightened.
He's terribly frightened.
He must've seen something.
He claimed he saw a monster, a horrible monster.
If he saw a monster, he's had too much sake.
No, no, Mr. Martin.
These island people are very superstitious.
Well, let's see what else we can find out.
[ Steve Narrating ]
It was decided that we'd spend the night...
and it gave me an opportunity
to witness a rare ceremony...
one that was all but forgotten.
dd [ Native ]
The island people are beset by many dangers, Steve - some real, some imagined.
This ceremony is dedicated
to one such danger.
There's a legend
among the island people...
that somewhere off their shores
there exists a monster... too terrible for a mortal to conceive.
Many centuries ago, they used to send a young girl out on a raft... each year as a sacrifice.
dd [ Continues ]
What's the name of this monster?
[ Man ]
Godzilla. Godzilla!
[ Japanese ]
Did you hear that? Godzilla.
They believe their, uh, Godzilla... is responsible for all these ship disasters?
They're certain of it.

It was more than wind, rain, and lightning.
Much more.
I wasn't just sure what it was.
No one was sure.
No one except the natives,
and they were positive.
They said it was Godzilla.
The next morning, the officials brought
some of the islanders back to Tokyo...
to make a direct report.
[ Chattering In Japanese ]
[ Japanese ]
Each of the natives of Odo Island...
told his own story
of the sudden turbulence...
and had his own ideas
of its cause.
They were all of the opinion
that the destruction was brought about...
by a living creature.
[ Japanese Continues ]
[ Japanese ]
I have not been to the island myself... but the world today is filled with many mysteries.
In the Himalayas, footprints of snowmen have been found.
No one knows
anything about them...
so there's no one
who can explain
a phenomenon
at the top of the world.
Is it not possible that some other
unexplainable phenomenon....
might exist at the bottom
of the ocean?
A research party should be organized to make... a scientific survey of Odo Island.
[ People Applauding ]
I'm going to catch Dr. Yamane.
I'll see you later.
It seems to me there are still forces left in this world... that none of us can understand.
[ Japanese ]
Oh, excuse me.
[ People Chattering ]
- Dr. Yamane.
- Steve Martin. It is good to see you.
You take this monster talk seriously?
Who can tell?
I understand you're heading the research group to Odo Island.
Yes. We leave this afternoon.
With your permission, I'd like to come.
I've been cleared by the security office.
Of course. Pier J at 2:00.
Good. I'll see you then.

[ Horn Blowing ]

But there was still
a feeling of anxiety among us all...
for every ship
that had taken this course...
had vanished
from the face of the earth.
Yes, there was a feeling of anxiety.
But perhaps the two exceptions...
were Emiko and a young
marine officer named Ogata.
At the moment, they seemed
more interested in each other.
When I'd last seen Emiko...
she had just become engaged
to Dr. Serizawa.
It was the usual triangle...
only this time it was
to play an important part...
in the lives of millions of people.

Look at the size of those footprints!
It can safely be assumed that two million years ago...
It can safely be assumed that two million years ago... this brontosaurus and other ancient reptiles roamed the earth.
It was known as the Jurassic age.
During this period,
there was another species which
we may call the intermediary animal...
a cross between the land-living
and the sea-living animals.
Let us call this creature Godzilla...
according to the legend
of Odo Island.
And judging from this photograph... this creature is over 400 feet tall.
[ All Murmuring ]
[ Man Exclaiming In Japanese ]
Of course, the question we are...
asking ourselves is how this animal...
happened to reappear
after all these centuries...
and so near to the coast of Japan.
One answer could be that some rare phenomenon of nature... allowed this breed of the Jurassic age to reproduce itself...
and for a long span of time, it had
no reason to reappear to the world.
But now that analysis
of radioactivity...
of the creature's footprint...
shows the existence of strontium 90...
a product of the H-bomb...
it is my belief that Godzilla
was resurrected... due to the repeated experiments of H-bombs.

You realize your story's front-page all over the country?
We want to know what's being done about this monster.
Well, here's your headline:
‘‘Security Decides to Use
Depth Bomb on Godzilla."
Oh, that's fine.
But how can they use depth bombs against something they can't even see?
Same way they look for a submarine: sonar.
Oh, they'll find him, all right.
The big question is, will they kill him?
Well, stay on it, Steve, and keep us posted.
I will. So long, George.
[ Phone Ringing ]

Steve, you are a better newspaperman than a linguist.

Emiko is coming over this evening, and she said it was important.
- All right. I'll check with you tomorrow.
- That will be fine, Steve.

[ Steve Narrating ] The marriage
between Emiko and Dr. Serizawa...
had been arranged
when they were both children.
And while Emiko wasn't in love
with the great scientist...
she had great respect
and admiration for him.
It proved difficult for her to tell him
she was going to marry Ogata.

of the day, it was generally assumed...
that the underwater demolition
had ended...
the short but terrible reign

Tokyo is surrounded
by high-tension electrical towers.
To get to the heart of the city...
Godzilla would have to break through
300,000 volts of electricity.
The officials are trying to have everything ready by nightfall.
Now I must report back to my station.
All right.
And thanks, Tomo.

Nothing new will develop unless -
- [ Ogata ] Unless what?
- I was shown a terrible secret... which is probably the only weapon which could destroy Godzilla.

never to reveal his secret to anyone.
Emiko...
Emiko, last night
Tokyo was destroyed.
Tomorrow it might be
Osaka or Yokohama.
If you can help, you must.
[ Emiko ]
When I went to see Dr. Serizawa...
I had intended to tell him about Ogata and me...
but there was something
he wanted to show me first.
[ Japanese ]
[ Screams ]
[ Emiko ] Dr. Serizawa had been
experimenting with oxygen...
when he came upon
a terrible chemical discovery -
a way to destroy
all oxygen in water...
thereby disintegrating
all living matter.
An amount no larger
than a baseball...
could turn Tokyo Bay
into a graveyard.
Serizawa had found
a terrible destructive power...
and until he could find
a counteracting good...
that would come
from this discovery...
he didn't want the world
to know his secret.
[ Japanese ]
[ Liquid Bubbling ]
He made me promise
never to tell what I had seen.
[ Ogata ]
Emiko, we need Serizawa's help.
There's no other way.
If I could only see him... just talk to him.
Perhaps I can change his mind.
Ogata will go with me.
Whatever you do, Emiko, you mustn't fail.
[ Ogata ]
Serizawa-san.
Sit down.
Doctor, I know of your Oxygen Destroyer.
- We must have it.
- I don't know what you are talking about!
I broke my promise, Serizawa.

You must use your Oxygen Destroyer against Godzilla. [ Sobbing ]

What was that?
Yes? Southern Sea Salvage,

What?
Right, I understand.
As soon as possible.
Emiko, I'm sorry...
What is it? An accident?
The Coast Guard received a distress call.
I'll have to cancel our date tonight.
I'm sorry I can't go with you, but you can still see it if you hurry.
It's a shame, but it's your job.
Well, you'd better hurry.
Southern Sea Steamship Company vessel, the "Eiko-maru," a 7,500-ton freighter, was reported lost... on August 13 at 19:05 hours.
Its last position, latitude 24 degrees north, longitude 141.02 degrees east.
Contact was lost for unknown reasons.
All units in sectors 3 and 4 stand by for action!
Thank you for calling me.
Thank you again.
What could have happened?
We have no idea.
It seems like there was a sudden explosion.
Communications suddenly halted shortly after we received their SOS.
Well, the "Bingo-maru" is approaching the area now.
We'll learn more soon enough.
They are here.
Certainly. The "Eiko-maru" and
"Bingo-maru" are both owned by the Southern Sea
Steamship Company.
Yes. They don't know how.
Can't you tell us if any survivors were seen?
Please wait a little longer.
We have a helicopter and two ships searching the area now.
We won't be sure of anything until we get their report.
Excuse me, why not send more ships?
Two ships are not enough for this!
No, we're not limiting the search party to two ships.
We'll make every effort to conduct a thorough search.
Until then, please be patient.
Hey!
Help us, please!
We're here! Hang in there!
It was incredible.
The ocean just blew up!
Blew up?
So far, three survivors were picked up by a fishing boat.
They are being taken to Odo Island.
We have sent the vessel "Kotaka" to assist them.
Which ship were the survivors from... the "Eiko-maru" or the "Bingo-maru"?
We are still investigating, but their names will be released soon enough.
I hope the three men know what happened.
We need to know more about the accidents.
Just a moment! Please, wait!
What's the matter?
I can't believe it.
I just can't believe it!
The fishing boat sank the same way.
News desk! Ah, Mr. Yamana?
Mr. Yamana, the other search boat was sunk!
In the same area... yes.
Yes, in the same way!
We're tired of hearing the same thing!
Please tell us what happened!
Please give us a chance to investigate!
Don't you know what's going on?
I'm sorry, but you must be patient!
Wait, please wait!

Then...
Godzilla must have done it.
The old man and Godzilla, both relics from days past!
Hey! What do you know about the old days?!
If you all keep thinking like that, you'll all become prey for Godzilla!
Anyhow, there must be some kind of animal in the sea.
That's why we can't catch anything.
But a creature that big would...
I knew it was stupid to open my mouth!
I try to tell you all, but nobody listens!

It will come from the ocean to feed on humankind to survive.

Odo Island Representatives
Mr. Ooyama.
There have been 17 houses destroyed with nine deaths...
I have heard that there were other damages.
Could you please tell us how bad they are?
Odo Island Village Mayor,
Mr. Inada.
Certainly, of course.
Twelve cows and eight pigs died.
I'm not lying!
It was hard to see in the dark, but it was an animal!
I know it goes against common sense, but the more I think about it, the more I am convinced that it was definitely not a normal hurricane.
The way the houses and helicopter were destroyed, it seems as if they were crushed from above!
Now, finally, we will hear the opinion of expert paleontologist
Professor Kyohei Yamane.
I suppose my opinion is a bit premature before a thorough investigation, but we are all aware of the discovery in the Himalayas of the alleged
"snowman footprints."
It is a mystery we have yet to solve.
The earth has many deep pockets, abyssal regions that contain secrets we have yet to discover.
For this incident,
I request the formation of a fact-finding party for a full investigation.
Good Luck,
Odo Island Research Party!
Good-bye!
We'll see you soon!
It was surprising to see
Dr. Serizawa at our departure.
He rarely leaves his laboratory.
I don't know if he believes this will be our final journey.
Well, what could go wrong?
Of course, we can avoid dangerous waters, but anything can happen.
For the time being, please don't use the water from this well.
It's dangerous.
This is horrible!
We can't use the well anymore?
Professor, if there was radioactive fallout, wouldn't the wells on the other side of the island be affected?
Yes. Why is it that the wells in this area were the only ones affected?
It doesn't make any sense.
Mr. Hagiwara, I think this depression might be the footprint of a creature.
Would you agree with me?
Is that true, Professor?
This footprint is radioactive.
Everybody, it's very dangerous here! Please step back!
Step back! Step back!
Emiko, look!
It's a trilobite!
A three-lobed creature that has long since been extinct!
Professor!
You shouldn't be touching that!
Professor, what is that thing?
This is... an incredible discovery!
It's on the other side of the hill!
It's on the other side of the hill!
Father!
What is it?
Tanabe, I saw it!
A creature from the Jurassic Period!
Where is it?
Emiko! Emiko!
Emiko!
Father!
This way! This way!
This way! This way!
What is that?
Those are footprints.
About 2 million years ago, this brontosaurus and these other dinosaurs roamed the earth during a period the experts called Jurassic.
During the following geological period, the Cretaceous, a creature somewhere between the marine reptiles and the evolving terrestrial animals was born.
I am convinced there was such an intermediate creature.
This creature, according to Odo Island folklore, is called Godzilla.
As we look at this photo of Godzilla's head from a hill on Odo Island, we can estimate that this creature stands approximately
50 meters tall.
So then, how can we explain the presence of such a creature during the present day?
It probably survived by eating deep sea organisms occupying a specific niche.
However, recent experimental nuclear detonations may have drastically altered its natural habitat.
I would even speculate that a hydrogen bomb explosion may have removed it from its surroundings.
Incredible!
Really!
I have strong evidence to support my theory.
First, the organism we found embedded in Godzilla's footprint, a trilobite.
This is a photo of the creature.
This is it.
This creature has been extinct for two million years, yet here it is in perfect physical condition.
Next is the sediment that we found in the trilobite's shell.
That sediment is sand.
There is no doubt that this sand matches the deposits found from the Jurassic period.
This sand is similar to the red clay found in the stratum of that particular period.
Professor, how do you know that this has something to do with the atomic bombs?
Because our Geiger counter readings of the radiation in this sand indicate the presence of Strontium-90.
Professor Tanabiya will explain this better in a moment, but basically, this sand that came from Godzilla has absorbed a massive dose of radiation, the type generated only from an atomic bomb.
Order, please! Order, please!
The evidence suggests that Godzilla itself must have absorbed an enormous amount of atomic radiation.
Order, please! Order, please!
Chairman! Chairman!
Mr. Ooyama.
I believe
Professor Yamane's report is of such extreme importance, it must not be made public.
What are you saying?!
Because it is so important, it should be made public!
Yes! Yes!
Be quiet!
What I mean is, if this Godzilla is the product from the use of atomic weapons...
Exactly!
That's exactly what it is!
She's right!
That's my point!
World affairs are fragile enough as it is!
If this were to be made public, can you imagine the consequences?
The truth is the truth!
That is what makes it such a delicate matter!
The improper handling of such a notion would engulf the country in a panic!
The government, the economy and international relations would plunge into total chaos!
You stupid idiot!
What are you saying?!
You dare to call me an idiot?!
Apologize! Apologize!
The truth must be made public!
Counter-Godzilla Headquarters

First, he'll probably eat you in one bite.

How could we create such a thing?
I guess I'll have to find a shelter soon.

Counter-Godzilla Headquarters
Isn't there any way they can get rid of this creature?
Longitude 138 to 138.07 degrees east.
Latitude 33.04 to 33.08 degrees north.
These are the coordinates of the anti-Godzilla frigate fleet.
Depth charges will be dropped in the area.
So vessels in the vicinity should be warned.
That's all.
Is that all?
That's all.
In response to the public outcry, the government is attempting to get rid of the monster known as Godzilla.
A frigate fleet has been ordered to begin a massive depth-charge attack in order to get rid of the creature.
The 10 vessel fleet left port at 10:00 a.m., heading for the coast of Odo Island.
At 10:19 a.m., they received orders to commence with their attack.
What's wrong with them?
The professor is a zoologist.
He doesn't want them to kill Godzilla.
Father! Father!
Father...
Please leave me alone for a while.
Emiko, please turn off the light.
Yes.
Godzilla! It's Godzilla!
Watch out! Watch out!
Please don't panic!
What a bother!
Have you tried solving the problem together?
They're sticking to their point of view.
How much longer will they keep us waiting like this?
For as long as they want.
It's annoying!
Please, Professor. Have a seat.
Excuse me.
Thank you for coming.
You're welcome.
This is quite a problem,
Professor.
If this keeps up, we'll have to suspend the international ship routes.
Have you found a way?
Is there something we can do to defeat him?
So, that's it?
Professor Yamane, let's be honest.
If there's a way to defeat
Godzilla, we'd like to know.
It's impossible!
He absorbed massive amounts of atomic radiation, but Godzilla still survived.
What do you think could kill him?
Instead, we should focus on why he is still alive.
That should be our top priority!
Professor Yamane's argument is absolutely correct!
This isn't the time to behave like idiots.
We should focus on scientific research!
Yes, but research at what cost?
You're right!
That's the question!
Hagiwara, interview this gentleman.
Dr. Serizawa?
Yes, he's Professor Yamane's future son-in-law.
Oh? The girl's fiance?
I'm sure my father will understand.
There's no reason for him to apologize.
But I can't help feeling uneasy when I think about Serizawa.
If it wasn't for the war, he wouldn't have received such a terrible scar.
Ogata...
Ever since I was a child,
I've always thought of him as an older brother.
Even now, my feelings for him have not changed at all.
Emiko, thanks.
Miss, Mr. Hagiwara would like to see you.
Mr. Hagiwara?
Yes, the reporter.
Hello! Excuse me.
Thank you.
What do you want?
Um... I'd like to ask you a favor.
The truth is, I tried to talk to Dr. Serizawa, but he refused to see me.
So, I was wondering if you could introduce me to him?
It's for our daily newspaper.
I'm sorry, but I need your help.
It's perfect.
I should go along with you to speak with Serizawa personally.
You're right, but I should break it to him my way.
Please let me go to speak with him first.
You're right. Well, go ahead.
Thank you. I'm sorry, but we should go.
I have a ride waiting outside.
I'll try my best to talk to him.
I'll help Shinkichi with his studies. See you later.
Serizawa Research Laboratory
There must be some mistake.
I haven't spoken to anyone about the importance of my research.
It's the truth.
A journalist in Switzerland met with a German scientist who stated that your project would be an incredible breakthrough in anti-Godzilla operations in Japan when completed.
I don't have any German scientist associates.
Really? Then what is the nature of your research right now?
No. I'd rather not speak about it.
Well, thank you for your time.
No, I'm sorry that I wasn't much help.
Excuse me.
I'll stay a little longer.
Really? Then, I'll be going.
I wanted to find out what his research was all about.
He's very moody, but please try to ask him again at another time.
I will. Good-bye.
Have a safe trip.
Well, what are you really studying now?
My father is also wondering what you are studying these days.
Emiko, would you like to see it?
Yes.
This must be strictly confidential.
Sure.
I'm risking my life in this project.
Would you be able to keep it a secret?
Follow me.
Wow!
Get back!
Emiko, you're the only one
I've shown this to.
Don't forget it.
Yes, I'll keep my promise.
Welcome back. We missed you.
Welcome home.
Did anything happen?
No, it was nothing.
Has Emiko come back?
Yes!
Godzilla!
Godzilla has come back!
Ogata!
I couldn't tell him about us.
I am Yamane, Professor Yamane!
I'm sorry, but I've been ordered not to let anyone pass!
Then tell your commander not to use lights on Godzilla!
They will only make him angry!
He can't be bothered by that now!
Professor, let's go to that hill.
Get back, please!
Get back, please!
International Researchers to Assist!
We are preparing to construct a 30 meter high, 80 meter deep barbed-wire fence along the coast.
We will send 50,000 volts of electric current through the fence in hope of electrocuting Godzilla to death.
We will have to evacuate the people along the coast, of course, and maintain a safe distance of 500 meters from the entire fence perimeter.
The Coast Guard and the Army will work to implement this defense plan.
Hurry! Hurry!
This is a Security
Command Announcement.
At 16:30 hours, Godzilla was sighted north of Kasonzaki, moving in a northeast direction.
A maximum security alert has been issued for the coastal zones in the Tokyo vicinity.
Third District. Third District.
Check! Check!
Third district!
Check!
This is a special news report.
This is a special news report.
All residents of the Minato,
Shinagawa and Osaku districts are to begin evacuating immediately.
Repeating, all residents of the Minato, Shinagawa and Osaku districts are to begin evacuating immediately.
Please keep your radio on for further reports.
Emiko, today I'm going to ask for your father's consent.
Will that be all right?
Welcome home.
What happened, Father?
All they can think about is killing Godzilla.
Why can't they try to study him from a radiological perspective?
It's an unique opportunity!
Professor, I agree with them.
Ogata, I do not take this matter lightly.
Godzilla is something that no one in the world has ever seen, and only those of us in Japan can study it!
But, Professor, that's no reason to do nothing while this monster ravages our country.
Isn't Godzilla a product of the atomic bomb that still haunts many of us Japanese?
Don't you think we should study what keeps a creature like this alive, regardless of the radiation it absorbs!
But...
All you want is to kill Godzilla, too?!
Go away! Get out of my house!
I'm very sorry.
No, I shouldn't have upset him like that.
No, Father has been like this.
Emiko, give me a chance to see him again.
This is a special bulletin!
This is a special bulletin!
Godzilla was spotted moving toward the coastline several minutes ago.
The barbed-wire fence along the shoreline is about to be charged with high voltage electricity.
We repeat...
Direction, 25 to 30 degrees!
Distance, 850!
Fires are raging through the Shihabara district.
We have no way to put them out.

We'll be joining your father in just a moment!
A little longer, a little longer, and we'll be with your daddy!
This is unbelievable, absolutely unbelievable!
Yet, the unbelievable is happening at this moment, right before our very eyes!
Right now, Godzilla is leaving behind a sea of flame!
From Ginza-Owari to Shinbashi,
Tamachi, Chiba and Shinabara, it's all become a sea of flames!
Now, Godzilla is starting to move again!
It appears that he is moving beyond the city limits!
To all of our viewers, this is not a play or a movie!
This is real, the most extraordinary story of the century!
Is the world going to be destroyed by a two million-year-old monster?
All personnel to the shelters!
All personnel to the shelters!
Quickly, please!
Quickly, please!
Operational Command Staff, proceed to shelter 306!
We are reporting to you live from a short-wave transmitter.
Godzilla is now approaching this broadcasting station, heading toward our TV tower!
There is no time for us to take cover!
We don't know what will happen to us!
He is getting even closer!
It looks like our doom!
I'm watching as he grabs onto the tower!
He has incredible strength!
This broadcast is over!
Good-bye, everyone, good-bye!
Godzilla has turned Tokyo into a sea of flames!
He is moving from Ueno to Asakusa and Shinagawa, apparently heading for the river!
Damn it! Damn it!
Damn it!
Damn it! Damn it!
He's running away!
He'll be back!
What can we do?
Damn it!
How can we get rid of him?!
Damn it!
Godzilla has retreated back into the sea.
Professor Yamane has been asked to work on a plan to defeat the monster.
No details are known at this time.
That is the news for now.
Mr. Ogata from Southern Sea Salvage.
Mr. Ogata from
Southern Sea Salvage.
There has been a change in the scheduled timetable.
Please report to the briefing room for further instructions.
Thank you for your help.
Your mother will be okay.
Emiko...
Ogata, I have something important to tell you!
I can't stay quiet anymore!
I must betray him.
Betray?
Yes. I made a promise to Serizawa.
Serizawa?
It's a secret I've been keeping, even from you!
But, now, I have to break my promise!
It happened on the day that Mr. Hagiwara and I went to see him.
That's when it happened.
Get back!
What was that?
Yes. All of the oxygen in the water was disintegrated.
The organisms in the tank died of asphyxiation.
Their remains were liquified by my Oxygen Destroyer.
Overall, it's a device that splits oxygen atoms into fluids.
My...
I intended to devote my work to the study of the element oxygen.
But, in the course of my research,
I came across an unknown form of energy.
In my first experiment,
I discovered a powerful force that scared me beyond words.
I didn't eat for two or three days!
Just a little piece of this, dropped into the water, could turn the entire Tokyo Bay into a graveyard!
Why are you working on such an awful project?
Emiko! I perform my work strictly as a research scientist!
But what if... what if your discovery is used for some horrible purpose?
You're right.
Used as a weapon, this would be as powerful as a nuclear bomb.
It could totally destroy humankind!
But I believe I can find a use for the Oxygen Destroyer that will benefit society.
Until then,
I won't reveal its existence.
That's why I didn't say anything to the reporter.
If I am forced to surrender this device in its present form...
I'll make sure the results of my experiments are destroyed in the event of my death.
I understand.
I won't tell anyone about this, not even my own father.
I had to break my promise.
So that's it?
But, Emiko, considering what Serizawa said, and the fact that this thing can be of help,
I'm sure he will forgive you for this.
Hello. Welcome back.
Serizawa.
What? Oh, it's you.
I have a favor to ask you today.
Well, have a seat.
What do you want from me?
I want to use the Oxygen Destroyer.
What Oxygen Destroyer?
I don't know what you're talking about!
Serizawa, why are you pretending?
Pretending?
Serizawa, I broke the promise
I made to you.
So I told him everything!
Please let him use the device!
I'm sorry! Please forgive me!
Emiko wanted to help after seeing the destruction.
Please try to forgive her.
Your device is our only hope!
Ogata, if Emiko told you everything about my device, you should know why I can't let you use it.
I must refuse!
Serizawa!
No!
Why is it wrong to use it for this?
Please go home!
Serizawa!
Serizawa!
Open the door, please! Serizawa!
Serizawa! What are you doing?!
Leave me alone!
Do you want to destroy years of research?
Let go!
Stop, please!
Serizawa!
Ogata!
Ogata!
Ogata, forgive me.
If my device can serve a good purpose,
I would announce it to everyone in the world!
But in its current form, it is just a weapon of horrible destruction!
Please understand, Ogata!
I understand, but if we don't use your device against Godzilla, what are we going to do?
Ogata, if the Oxygen Destroyer is used even once, politicians from around the world will see it.
Of course, they'll want to use it as a weapon.
Bombs vs. Bombs, missiles vs. Missiles, and now a new super weapon to throw upon us all!
As a scientist, no, as a human being,
I can't allow that to happen!
Am I right?
Well, what do we do about the horror before us now?
Should we just let it happen?
If anyone can save us now,
Serizawa, you're the only one!
If... you use the device to defeat Godzilla, unless you reveal what you have done, who will know about it?
Ogata, humans are weak animals.
Even if I burn my notes, the secret will still be in my head.
Until I die, how can I be sure
I won't be forced by someone to make the device again?
What am I going to do?
"Oh Peace, Oh Light, Return," the prayer for peace that took place all over the country today.
Here we see the Tokyo chapter of this event.
Listen to the young voices as they put the strength of their lives into their song.
May we live without destruction
May we look to tomorrow with hope
May peace and light return to us.
Serizawa!
Ogata, you are right.
But this will be the first and last time that I will ever allow the Oxygen Destroyer to be used.
Don't cry, Emiko.
This is the only way to be sure that it won't fall into the wrong hands.
We are getting closer to the moment of truth.
We will soon know if Godzilla, the monster that has terrorized the world will be finally buried forever in the ocean depths.
At this time, Geiger-counter readings are being used to pinpoint Godzilla's location.
Ogata, get me a diving suit.
What are you saying?!
You have no experience in using a diving suit!
Serizawa... Ogata is right.
Let him do it.
Professor, this is the only Oxygen Destroyer
I have!
To use it properly,
I have to do it underwater.
All right.
We'll do it together.
No. I'll do this myself.
You're crazy.
I won't allow someone with no experience to go down alone!
Hey! Get another diving suit ready!
Okay? Please don't go down alone!
Will the only Oxygen Destroyer in the world be powerful enough to do the job?
Its inventor, Dr. Serizawa, remains silent.
All we can do now is pray for its success.
Professor...
I never thought
I'd reveal it in this way.
I'll be praying for you.
All right!
You two be very careful.
Ogata, we're counting on you.
Right!
The time has come.
Right now, Dr. Serizawa is being lowered into the water.
They've reached the bottom!
Pull!
Start pulling!
Serizawa! Serizawa!
Serizawa!
Serizawa! Serizawa!
What's going on?! Serizawa!
Ogata, it worked!
Both of you, be happy.
Good-bye... farewell!
Serizawa! Hey, bring him up!
Serizawa!
Serizawa...
This exhilaration, this jubilation, we have won!
We can see that Godzilla will never rise from the ocean's depths again!
This victory could not be achieved if it weren't for the young scientist, Dr. Serizawa.
He wanted us to be happy...
I can't believe that Godzilla was the only surviving member of its species...
But, if we keep on conducting nuclear tests, it's possible that another
Godzilla might appear... somewhere in the world, again.
Salute!
At ease!

Would you mind coming into my office right away, please?
Thank you.
As I was saying, our search planes
Found the wreckage of your husband's plane, Mrs Martin.
A rescue crew was sent out, but...
But they must have reached the wreckage hours ago.
Why can't they find him?
I honestly don't know, Mrs Martin.
[KNOCKING AT DOOR]
Yes, come in.
CURT KRUGER: Ellen.
Curt.
Colonel Banks, isn't there any hope?
COLONEL BANKS: I'm afraid not, Mrs Martin.
They found the pilot dead in the wreckage,
And according to all reports, no one could have bailed out.
I'm terribly sorry.
[SOBBING]
Doctor Martin!
Doctor Martin, are you all right?
I, I am, yes.
It's Doctor Martin.
Call the base hospital.
Come on, doctor, come on.
All right, look up to your right.
Now, look over to your left.
All right, you can get up now.
Well, everything seems all right, except can't you recall
Anything that happened from the time your plane crashed until...
I remember the controls froze.
The next thing I saw was the main gate of the base.
Your plane was completely demolished,
The pilot burned to death, and you
Show up the picture of health.
Are you sure you weren't driven here?
Positive.
You don't remember where you got this?
Mm-mm.
You know, your medical chart shows
No indication of any scars on your body.
I must have got it in the crash.
No, no this was surgery, a very skillful incision.
I've never had an operation.
Now, that's what
I don't understand.
Mr Briggs.
Colonel Banks.
How are you, Mr Briggs?
Fine, how are you?
Fine, I see the FBI doesn't waste much time.
Well, uh, not if we can help it, Colonel.
Oh, you know our base surgeon, Major Clift?
Sure.
How have you been, Major?
How do you do?
Well, I guess you gentlemen have business to discuss.
Oh, no, no, this won't take a minute.
Sit down.
Sit down if you please, gentlemen.
Cigarette?
Oh, thank you.
I understand you've already talked with Doctor Martin.
I just left him.
You know, ah, Colonel, um, according to my files,
Doctor Martin is just about the key man
On this nuclear project.
Yes, along with
Doctor Kruger, he is.
Well, I know they're both good friends,
And, uh, well, both have knowledge
And access to top secret information.
Well, that's very true, but there's no
Reason to suspect that they...
Oh, we can, uh, we can suspect anything, Colonel,
Until Doctor Martin accounts for every minute
From the time of the crash.
The shock must have caused a mental block.
His mind doesn't want to remember the details,
The origin of the scar on his chest,
How he got back to the base under his own power.
Did you ever stop to think that perhaps this Doctor
Martin isn't really the Doctor Martin?
What are you getting at?
What I mean is that, uh, this man could be an imposter.
[PHONE RINGING]
Briggs speaking.
Oh, oh they did come through, huh?
They do check?
That's what I've been waiting for, thanks.
Get me Colonel Banks at the base, please No, no, I'll wait.
Oh yes, Mr Briggs.
Any news on the line you were getting on Doctor Martin.
Just heard from
Washington, and I was wrong,
This is our man, all right.
His prints and description check right down the line.
Now, here's what
I suggest you do.
But you say he's in excellent physical condition,
Yet you're keeping him in the base hospital.
Why?
Mrs Martin, you must realize that your husband is
Engaged in a highly secret work.
If this experience had, well, affected his mind...
Are you trying to tell me that Doug is...
No, no, no, it's nothing serious, Mrs Martin.
His reflexes are excellent, except for that one lapse
Of memory, his mind is perfectly clear.
Isn't that natural under the circumstances?
Yes, except for the question of the scar on his chest.
I know he didn't have it before the crash.
Well, I'm sure he didn't,
Mrs Martin, but you see,
It would be impossible for a wound of the size
To have healed so quickly and without medical attention.
Well, you can't keep him here indefinitely.
We don't intend to.
We asked you to come down here, because we've
Decided to let you take him home, provided you can keep
It quiet and he gets enough rest.
I understand.
Now we'll just have to take that vacation
He's been wanting for so long.
Vacation.
To watch him, you'd think he'd never heard of one.
Yes, he must have asked me 100 times
When the next test was scheduled.
He's anxious to take his own readings, again.
Well, he did have a key part in the planning of these projects.
Well, is there anything he should
Or shouldn't be allowed to do?
No, except he does need diversion,
Anything that won't upset or excite him.
I see, movies, bridge, drives, things like that.
Well, you're the doctor, now.
Just see that he gets plenty of rest.
Thank you.
Good bye, Colonel.
Good bye.
See you later, Major.
[MOANING]
Doug, what's the matter?
I can't sleep.
What time is it?
Little after three.
I'm going to go get myself a glass of milk.
Get me squadron operation.
Duty desk, please.
Ellen, what did you get up for?
This is Doctor Martin calling.
Who is this speaking?
Sergeant Bandero.
Is there anything I can do for you, Doctor?
I wondered if there were any last minute
Orders on another atomic test.
What do you mean, you can't tell me?
Sorry sir, regulations.
I can't give out information to anyone.
No sir, it won't do you any good to come down.
All right, we'll see about that.
I've got to get out to the base right away.
Ellen don't you agree with me?
I've spent months preparing for this series of tests,
And no Sergeant is going push me around, now.
Well, aren't you say anything?
No.
Look, I know they're ready for another test,
And I should be there.
Can't you understand that they don't
Want you around for your own good?
I don't need their sympathy.
There's nothing wrong with me.
Then why are you acting this way?
You're all on edge.
If you don't slow down, I don't know what's going to happen.
You really believe that, don't you.
Look Doug, if you won't take it easy for your own sake,
Please, do it for mine.
Hey.
Hey, time to get up.
Go away.
All right stay in bed all day.
It's almost 11 o'clock.
What'd you say?
I said it was almost 11 o'clock.
It is?
Mhmm.
Oh, you go put the coffee on while I get dressed.
I don't care what you say, you had
No right to go ahead without me.
And you, Curt, you didn't tell me, either.
Why?
Orders, Doug.
Orders, nonsense.
The least that could have been done
Would have been to let me know.
I'm fine.
I could have done my work.
I hate to say this, Doctor Martin,
But in your present state, you're
Not considered a very good security risk.
Me, security risk?
My present state?
What's the matter with me?
How long am I to be considered...
Only temporarily.
The results of the test will be available for your study
When you return to work.
I am ready, Colonel.
To us, you're still a very sick man.
My advice to you is to go home and relax as you were ordered.
Relax, relax!
And if I don't?
Then you'll be confined to the base
Hospital 'til you change your mind.
Now, what's it going to be?
Well, Doctor.
Oh, Doctor Martin.
I didn't expect you back so soon.
Why, haven't you heard?
I'm a mental case.
Can't even be trusted with my own work.
Ah!
Liable to go berserk at any minute.
Colonel Banks will fill you in on the details.
Now, don't, don't tell me, let me see, you're, uh,
I know, I know, you're
Miss, uh, Vincent,
The secretary I share with, uh, hmm...
Oh Doctor, you can't be serious.
Uh, there was no one in your office,
So I thought you wouldn't mind.
No, that's all right, it's all right.
As far as I'm concerned you can take the rest of the day off.
Are you sure?
Mhmm, oh, I don't really belong here, I just,
Uh, just came in to pick up a few personal things
From my desk.
Good bye.
Good bye.
[PHONE RINGING]
[PHONE RINGING]
[FOOTSTEPS]
[DOOR OPENING]
Main gate, main gate, please.
[PHONE RINGING]
Just a minute, Doctor.
Main gate, Sergeant Powers.
Doctor Kruger?
Doctor Kruger, Doctor
Kruger, no, he checked out.
Yeah, about 20 minutes ago.
OK.
Sorry to keep you waiting, Doctor.
That's all right.
OK, Doctor.
Will you sign out, please?
We'll post a couple of men outside
Of Doctor Kruger's office.
Get me Colonel Banks at the Officer's Club.
Thank you, Doctor.
Good night.
Good evening, Doctor Kruger.
Yes.
My name's Briggs.
I'm from the FBI.
Briggs, Briggs, of course.
I've heard of you.
I wonder if you'd mind returning to your office
With me?
What seems to be the trouble?
Oh, just a few things we'd like to straighten out.
Concerns me?
Well, I'm afraid so, Doctor.
You can take your own car, if you like.
I'll met you there.
All right, I will.
The papers seem to be intact.
Is this all, uh, classified information, Doctor?
Of course.
You know, according to security regulations,
That vault should have been locked before you left.
But I'm certain I did lock it.
All right, then tell me this, who, besides yourself,
Has access to the combination?
Well, the Colonel, here, and Doctor Martin.
Doctor Martin.
He was in building this afternoon.
That's right, we saw him in my office.
He left around 4 o'clock on orders.
He dismissed his secretary a few minutes later,
But he, he didn't sign out of here
'Til 20 minutes after you left.
After I did?
Well, there must be some mistake.
I personally checked his office just as I was leaving,
And he wasn't there.
Do you always do that?
Well no, but Doctor Martin has been acting, well,
Quite strange of late.
Yes, he certainly has.
His wife telephoned to say that he hadn't come home as usual.
I was very much concerned about him.
So am I. He still hasn't show up, yet.
What kind of pipe tobacco do you use, Doctor Kruger?
Me?
Why, I don't smoke at all.
And you, Colonel?
Cigarettes.
What are you driving at?
That's funny.
How long has Doctor Martin been using this brand of tobacco?
Well, I really don't know.
Why?
Well now, Mrs
Martin, you say you
Have no idea where he could be at this hour.
Why no, he's never been this late
Before without telephoning.
Well, I hate to ask this, but have you ever had any suspicion
That there might be another woman?
Certainly not.
I'm sorry, Mrs Martin.
Just why are you asking me these questions?
Well, let's put it this way, has he made any new friends
Lately, you know, people not in the usual group?
No, the only people we've seen in months
Have been connected with the institute.

[TIRES SQUEALING]
[HORN HONKING]
They're here, they're going to... here, they're here,
They're here, they're going to destroy us.
He's coming out of it.
It's all right, Doctor Martin.
You're with friends.
You'll be all right.
Let me go!
Let me go!
That's enough, that's enough.
They'll kill everyone.
We've got to stop them!
Easy, Doug, easy.
What did you give him?
Sodium amytal, truth serum.
It'll deprive his mind of any imagination.
I guess he'll make sense, now.
I'll get the recorder ready.
Can you hear me Doctor Martin?
DOCTOR MARTIN: Yes.
Now, listen to me, I want you to count backwards from 100.
Do you understand?
Backwards from 100.
Oh, you can ask him questions, now.
Doctor Martin, what were you doing with the information
You took from Doctor
Kruger's vault?
I was delivering it.
Delivering it?
But where?
To the rocks in Soledad Flats?
Yes, Soledad Flats, right where we crashed.
I was delivering it, just as I was ordered.
Who ordered you to do this, Doctor Martin?
I'll tell you the whole story.
I remember we were circling the atomic cloud.
There was an object glowing beneath us at Soledad Flats.
We were going down to investigate.
Controls jammed, couldn't pull out.
When I regained consciousness,
I was on a table.
Next thing I knew, they were coming at me, strange people.
Their eyes, those horrible eyes.
They didn't speak.
I could see something strange and eerie pulsating
In front of me.
Then one of them lowered it toward my chest.
It was my own heart.
What happened?
What is this place?
Who are you?
What are you doing to me?
Can't you speak?
Who are you?
Step forward.
Doctor Martin, I see you are quite well.
You have recovered from your unfortunate accident.
Who are you?
A scientist, like yourself.
Where do you come from?
From a planet yet unknown to you.
You know my name.
You speak English.
We speak every language.
You can't expect me to believe that.
I'm getting out of here.
Stay where you are.
[ELECTRICITY SURGING]
Who are you?
I have already told you that.
How did you get here?
[ELECTRICITY SURGING]
Here, in our machine, magnetically
Propelled across the electron bridge we have created.
Electron bridge?
You mean, you come and go, just like that without anyone
Ever seeing you?
Our ships have been sighted on numerous occasions
By your people.
And why haven't we been able to track one down?
We have a warning system, similar
To your primitive radar.
Our machines are set to change course
At the mere approach of a pursuing object.
Let's say I do believe you.
Where are we right now?
In a cavern within the upper crust of the Earth.
How long have you been here?
Since the beginning of your experiments in nuclear fission.
What have you got to do with that?
We are accumulating the energy released
With each of your atomic explosions.
[ENERGY SURGING]
One moment.
[SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE]
What was that?
A report from the monitor we sent to the surface
To obtain the results of your last nuclear test.
Results?
They'll take days to analyze and compute.
I think you will find these figures are correct.
I can't believe it.
Where is that man?
You don't recognize the area?
No.
He is in the vicinity where you crashed.
That rock was glowing.
A normal reaction in view of the amount of radiation
Absorbed.
You have a remarkable memory,
Doctor, considering the fact
That you did not survive the crash.
What do you mean?
The mechanism of your heart, it ceased to function.
It was necessary for us to revive it.
You were dead.
I was dead?
So that's what they were doing.
You didn't even try to help the pilot, why did you save me?
Because we had an important need of your services.
Such as?
[ELECTRICITY SURGING]
Look this way, Doctor.
You will understand.
[ELECTRICITY SURGING]
Here Doctor, you are the first of your world
To be looking at our solar system, the Astran.
This is our planet,
Astran Delta.
It occupies the fourth position in relation to this, our sun.
Yes, go on.
During the 23rd time rotation our sun began to die.
So during the succeeding generations,
As our planet began to cool, vegetation began to disappear.
Our eyes developed to this state to combat
The ever-growing darkness.
We were forced to migrate.
You left your planet?
Where?
We invaded these neighboring planets.
They were nearer to our sun.
You just moved in and took over?
How many of you?
All of us, well over one billion.
There were feeble attempts to stop us,
But we were prepared for such contingencies.
And now that our sun is about to completely expire,
We must move again in order to survive.
Yours is the only planet in this solar system
Capable of supporting our civilization.
This is fantastic, over a billion
Of you trying to come here to Earth.
We had no alternative.
We have been putting our plan to work for some time.
At the proper moment, the invasion
Will be launched from out platforms,
Which are being readied in space.
[ELECTRICITY SURGING]
ALIEN: Nothing can stop us.
You must be insane.
This is ridiculous.
You cannot find your way in or out of this cavern.
Do not try to leave.
[ELECTRICITY SURGING]
[ELECTRICITY SURGING]
[ELECTRICITY SURGING]
[AMPLIFIED ANIMAL NOISES]
[LAUGHING]
So you have discovered our menagerie.
Don't you think you will be more at ease
On this side of the cage?
I... it's horrible.
What are you doing here?
We are breeding our, shall I say, armies?
Those carnivorous insects and animals?
What have you done to them?
Their growth is due to a change in their genes.
At your next nuclear test, these animals will multiply at a rate
Beyond imagination.
When the time comes, we will unleash them.
They will spread to every continent
And devour every living thing on the surface of the Earth.
Well, what good will that do you?
How could you expect to survive better than we?
We have provided for that.
[ELECTRICITY SURGING]
No, Doctor, look over there.
We will use their bodies to fertilize the soil.
Vegetation will rise up in abundance.
A new era of civilization will begin.
Gamma rays?
You see, Doctor, we have arranged for everything.
Wait a minute.
All this equipment?
Our nucleostorage units.
To date, we have accumulated several billion electron volts
As a result of your atomic explosions.
Several billion?
Why, a chain reaction at this point,
Could release enough unstable isotopes to,
To create a new and powerful element,
Might be impossible to control.
True, an element that will never
Be known by your scientists.
I can assure you the strength of this new element-
- Well, this is a powder keg, could go up at any minute.
I assure you, Doctor, we have everything
Under our complete control.
What force could possibly be strong enough
To harness the...
Now, you control
Your whole operation by electricity.
Of course, no generators, no generators.
That means you're getting your power
From somewhere on the surface.
It must be passing through here.
You have heard enough, Doctor Martin.
Step inside.
All right.
What do you want from me?
You will have access to advanced information
Relative to the time and strength
Of the forthcoming atomic tests.
What about it?
You will provide us with that information
As soon as it is available.
I see.
You're afraid of an overload.
You can't tap enough electricity, wherever you get
It from, to hold a strong enough charge.
You are a clever man,
Doctor, perhaps too clever.
And what makes you think
I'll give you any information?
It is the only way you can save your own life
When the time comes.
You will be transported to one of our platforms in space
And resettled here when our operation is completed.
You're asking me to sabotage the entire world,
Three billion people.
They are doomed in any case.
Well, I guess there's no alternative.
I have to do as you say.
You are lying, Doctor.
Your only wish is to betray us.
No.
I know.
Your thoughts have been recorded.
Lie detector?
Call it what you like.
You force me to resort to other methods.
I will contact our space station.
MALE VOICE: You are an unwilling subject, Doctor Martin.
What?
Who are you?
I am The Tala.
You will listen and obey.
No, I...
You will listen to my orders and obey me.
You will listen and obey.
Listen...
And obey.
You will remember nothing you have seen or heard here,
Nothing but my orders, which you will obey.
Yes.
You will obtain the data, and bring it
To the stone near the place where your plane was wrecked.
DOCTOR MARTIN: To the stone.
What have you seen or heard here?
What have you seen or heard here?
Nothing.
Repeat my orders.
I will obtain the data and bring it to the stone.
Well, that's what I did.
I took the information to where they told me.
I didn't realize I was being mesmerized.
Why didn't somebody say something?
Don't you believe me?
Curt, you understand.
These giant animals, breeding by the millions,
They'll devour everything unless we stop them.
Of course, Doug, we will.
Colonel, Colonel, you've got to arrange to set off other bomb,
Tonight, the strongest charge we have.
They're beneath the ground with all their equipment.
We can blow them to pieces.
Now, wait a minute.
A strong charge will overload their units.
You, you don't believe me, Colonel?
Major?
Curt?
Of course we do.
Easy, Doug, easy.
You think I'm crazy, all of you.
Well, I'm not.
Do you understand?
Everything I said is true.
I saw it with my own eyes.
Give me a hand, Doctor.
No, let me go!
Let me go!
Steady, steady, steady, take it easy.
Take it easy.
We'll talk this whole thing over.
(SLEEPILY) What are you doing to me, now?
You just rest quietly.
That's it.
Mrs Martin should be along any minute, now.
She went for their car.
What'll I tell her?
Well, he's in a state of shock.
Tell her he's resting quietly.
If you'll excuse me,
I think I'd better
Wait for her at the information desk.
Well, Doctor Martin seems to be indestructible,
Except for those hallucinations.
Those weren't hallucinations, Colonel.
Under the influence of sodium amytal,
A patient loses all control of his imagination.
Well, then he shouldn't be able to fabricate those stores.
That's right.
Major, you're not trying to tell us that everything he said
Was true?
Look, gentleman, I can only give you the medical facts.
As for the rest, you'll have to decide for yourself.
Excuse me, please.
[CAR REVVING]
Good evening, Doctor Kruger.
Chili isn't it?
Oh, Mr Briggs, you startled me.
I didn't expect to see anyone here.
Well, neither did I, Doctor.
Well, I suppose you want me to explain why I'm here.
Mhmm.
I want to believe Doug.
We've worked together a long time.
Anyway, I just had to come out here and check for myself.
Check what, Doctor?
For an entrance or an exit to the caverns he described.
I'm afraid you're wasting your time.
Cigarette, Doctor?
No, think you.
See, we've already covered the entire area.
We couldn't find a thing.
Then what about that scar?
I'd like to see you disprove that.
Oh, Mrs Martin.
Oh, how is he, Doctor?
Oh, he's resting fine.
I think he'll be all right.
How's the car?
There's nothing to worry about...
DOCTOR MARTIN:
Keep away from me.
Keep away, I said!
Stop!
Let me go!
They're after me!
Nobody's after you, Doctor Martin.
Keep away!
Doug, he's trying to help you.
I don't need any help!
I, I want to see
Curt, right away.
Now, you control yourself, and I'll call him just as
Soon as you get back to your room.
Now, you get back into bed, and I'll call Doctor Kruger.
I, I've got to figure something out before he gets here.
I'll need a pencil, some paper, and a slide rule.
I'll see that you get it.
Oh, can I have Doctor
Kruger, please.
[PHONE RINGING]
Doctor Kruger speaking.
Oh yes, Major, how is he?
All right, I'll be over in a few minutes.
Doug.
Doug.
Doug.
Curt!
Ellen, I got here as soon as I could.
Is there anything wrong?
He's much better.
And Major, he's even started working.
He asked for paper and a slide rule.
That's interesting.
I wonder what he's up to.
Formulas, equations, anyway, whatever he said,
Pretend to agree with him, Major Clift's orders.
Of course.
Doug.
Doug, Curt's here.
Hello, Doug.
Just a second.
I'm almost finished.
I'll take your hat.
Thank you.
Curt, let's face it.
I know that you all think there's
Something wrong with me.
No, of course not.
No, I wouldn't blame you after the story I told last night.
Well, frankly you did have us a little worried
Asking that a bomb be dropped because of what you said.
Now, you don't believe me, either.
Curt, I tell you,
I've been there.
I've seen what they're doing, breeding animals
Into carnivorous monsters, but I don't need a bomb to stop them.
I've figured it out.
It's all here.
Now look, here's the nuclear strength of our last test,
And this is the amount of electricity
Needed to control it.
Let me see that.
I had to estimate the conversion
Rates of their transformers.
If these figures are correct, such transforms
Must operate on a constant supply of electricity.
Where could they get that much electric power?
Only one way, they must tap it from the main lines
At the power house.
If they do it by parallel induction,
Nobody'd ever know the difference.
All we have to do is to cut it off.
Cut off the power?
We can't do that.
It would cause untold damage for miles around.
Such a power stoppage must be planned in advance.
8 to 10 seconds, that's all I need.
That gap in supply will short out their resistors
And the whole thing'll go up.
But you won't go along with that, no no, not you.
Doug get back in bed.
I've got the car keys.
Now look, you're carrying this too far.
Out of my way.
Doug!
Please call the main gate and try to stop Doctor Martin.
Doug took the car, hurry!
Doctor Martin!
Stop!
[TIRES SQUEALING]
Stop!
He did what?
How long ago?
Right, we'll leave immediately.
What's wrong, Colonel?
Doctor Martin, he's on his way to the power house,
Wants to cut off the power supply.
Well, let's go.
I couldn't stop him,
Doctor, he went that way.
[TIRES SQUEALING]
Hey, no parking!
[LOUD MACHINERY]
[PHONE RINGING]
OK, you run up the stairs, I'll look here.
[TIRES SQUEALING]
There's his car.
Come on, hurry!
He isn't back there.
Let's go.
Where is the driver of this car?
He went into the building.
We better take the stairs.
What do you want?
Where are the main switches?
Hey, what's the with you?
You sleep walking or something, Mister?
Where are the switches that control the...
[PHONE RINGING]
Soledad Flats area?
I said, where are they?
This way.
[PHONE RINGING]
Phone.
Control room.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Come on.
Show me those switches, come on!
All right.
Cut that power.
Now look, Mister, be reasonable.
I said, cut it.
Now the next one.
Next.
Go on.
That'll turn the power off for 100 miles.
Do as I say.
Stay where you are.
Put down that gun, Doctor Martin.
I'm warning you, Colonel, come any closer and I'll kill him.
Now the next one.
What's this one?
That's the master switch.
Cut it.
ELLEN MARTIN: Doug, please, don't.
I said, cut it.
Get back or I'll kill him.
Go on, get back.
Go on, get back.
Do as he says.
DOUG MARTIN: Give me 10 seconds after I cut the power.
If I'm insane, nothing will happen,
And you can do what you want with me.
But if I'm right...
Now, one, two, three,
Four, five, six, seven, eight...
[LOUD RUMBLING]
Over here.
Soledad Flats, right on the button.
Just as he said.
He blew them to pieces.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
Know then the legend of the hound of the Baskervilles.
Know then that the great hall of Baskervilles...
was once held by Sir
Hugo of that name...
a wild, profane, and godless man.
An evil man, in truth...
for there was with him a certain ugly and cruel humor...
that made his name a byword in the county.
- Our friend learns swiftly.
- Aye.
He's already learned to fly like a wildfowl... and now he swims like a waterfowl.
Shall we see how he roasts?
Fetch him.
By morning, our friend will know better than to condemn the sport of his master.
Come on out. Come on.
Here he comes, Sir Hugo.
Here he is, Sir Hugo.
Now our waterfowl has become guinea fowl.
Guinea pig, more likely.
Bird or beast, we'll soon make him sing like a nightingale.
Now, sir....
This may teach you to criticize my pleasures.
If 'twere anyone but my own daughter, Master...
You should be proud that a Baskerville... should so much as look at your miserable child.
Pay up!
No, no! The game was spoiled before the wager was laid.
Do not crowd me, sirs, I pray you.
I will not pay.
What about the wager?
If I must, I must.
- But not in gold.
- Not in gold?
In kind, with a plaything
I was keeping for myself.
I accept. Where is the girl?
Girl? What talk is this of a girl?
I know of no girl.
Enough!
You shall see her at once, and before
Sir Richard bursts with passion.
See to it that there be no fighting among your herd of rams.
The bitch has got away.
What does she think I am, that she does this to me?
Damn her!
I have her now.
You there! Let loose the pack!
And you, my hunter at the door...
- ...set the hounds on her.
- But, sir, you cannot...
The hounds! Let loose the pack!
- Yeah, I'll get her.
- My friend, you cannot do this.
I'll get her!
May the hounds of Hell take me if I can't hunt her down!
Come on.
Come on, what's the matter with you? Come on, will you?
Now, you witch!
No.
"And so, the curse of Sir Hugo...
"came upon the Baskervilles...
"in the shape of a hound from Hell...
"forever to bring misfortune...
"to the Baskerville family.
"Therefore, take heed...
"and beware the moor in those dark hours when evil is exalted...
"else you will surely meet the hound of Hell...
"the hound of the Baskervilles.
"So ends the legend."
And what, may I ask, do you think of that, Mr. Holmes?
There must be hundreds of similar folk stories.
I fail to see why I should find this one of singular interest.
What do you say, Watson?
I'm sure Dr. Mortimer's intentions are for the best... but there seems little to be gained from what he's told us.
I had hoped, sir, that the facts
I have laid before you... might have intrigued you as a detective.
I was obviously mistaken.
Good day to you, sir.
Dr. Mortimer, it was something more important... that brought you from
Devonshire to Baker Street... something that occurred on Dartmoor on Friday, the 13th of June.
You've known about it all the time, then?
I know nothing, except that you live on Dartmoor... have a copy of the Devon County
Chronicle in your briefcase... dated June 14.
That newspaper is published on Saturdays, but goes to press on Thursday.
You've kept it for something vitally important.
The headlines aren't interesting, so it must be in the stop press.
Whatever it was happened on
Friday, the 13th of June.
- But this is remarkable.
- Superficial.
There's nothing remarkable about using one's eyes.
Now, sir, would you be prepared to give us the relevant facts?
Why, yes.
Under the circumstances,
I think I would.
- Proceed.
- Thank you.
This is just the stop press.
"Devonshire knight found dead.
"The body of Sir Charles Baskerville discovered on Dartmoor early today.
"Foul play not suspected."
The account in the next edition is much fuller.
Now, where are we?
Yes, here we are.
"The death of Sir Charles Baskerville has caused much sadness...
"in the small village of Grimpen, Dartmoor.
"Dr. Richard Mortimer, a well-known
Devonshire personality...
- "said today that"...
- If you'll pardon me, Dr. Mortimer...
I want just the plain facts in your own words.
Please.
Very well.
The plain facts of the matter are that a fortnight ago...
Sir Charles Baskerville was found dead on the moor.
- Who found him?
- His servant, Barrymore.
He and his wife are housekeepers up at Baskerville Hall.
He fetched me at once and took me back to the body.
Where was the body? Dartmoor, I know, but exactly where? It's a large place.
Near the abbey ruins up on the hill, not far from Baskerville Hall.
The place where Sir Hugo died in the legend... and the circumstances were exactly the same.
You mean Sir Charles had been attacked?
- That his throat had been torn out?
- No. The body was untouched.
But his face....
Never in all my medical career have I seen such a look of horror on a dead person.
Sir Charles must have been terrified when he died.
But he was alone.
The strange thing was, there were no footprints, Mr. Holmes.
That cannot be quite true.
There were the servants', for instance, your own, and Sir Charles'.
Yes, of course, but what
I meant to say was... there were no other footprints.
Facts are only of value when they're clear, concise, and correct.
Pray, continue.
And there was another strange thing.
Sir Charles must've been tiptoeing back to Baskerville Hall when he died.
I could tell that because the footmarks showed only the toes of his boots.
There were no heel marks.
I'm something of an archaeologist in my spare time... and so I'm used to looking for the extraordinary.
You have not yet told us what Sir Charles died of.
Before you do, sir, I suggest it was heart failure.
The inquest found that he died of arteriosclerosis... a disease of the coronary arteries.
A condition of the heart... that can lead to heart failure.
Yes. I think it must be hereditary with the Baskervilles.
They all seem to suffer from the same weakness.
Is there a successor to the family title?
Yes. Sir Henry Baskerville.
He's due to arrive in London tonight from Johannesburg.
Why have you come to me, when you really don't believe... that I can help you?
- I don't think I know what you mean.
- I think you do.
Excuse me.
Although you knew the cause of death, you've implied a more horrible death... that he might have seen the hound of
Hell, the curse of the Baskervilles.
Do you really believe that legend?
There are many things in life and death that we do not understand.
Then I suggest you consult a priest instead of a detective.
Do you think I can influence the powers of darkness?
Of course not.
I thought you might prevent Sir
Henry from going into danger.
If there is an evil curse on the family... it can be just as powerful in London as in Devonshire.
- Where will he be staying?
- At the Northumberland Hotel.
Does this mean that you'll investigate the matter?
I have not said. My commitments are heavy.
I beg of you, Mr. Holmes, this is a matter of life and death.
There can be no harm done by my seeing the man.
Shall we say 10:00 tomorrow morning, at the hotel?
Good. That will suit admirably.
Thank you, Mr. Holmes.
You will not find me ungenerous in the matter of fees.
My professional charges are upon a fixed scale.
I do not vary them, except when I remit them altogether.
Good day.
Good day, Mr. Holmes.
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Not at all, Doctor.
Good day, Dr. Watson.
I must say, you never cease to surprise me, Holmes.
First you tear him apart, and then you say you'll help him.
My dear Watson, you ought to know me better.
I had to burst the balloon, deflate his pomposity... to find one significant clue.
I saw nothing of significance in anything he said.
I'm surprised you bothered with him.
Nevertheless, one important point did emerge.
Didn't you notice anything odd in what he said?
The only thing I noticed was that he said Sir Charles... was tiptoeing about
Dartmoor at night.
That's just it, Watson. Well done, my boy. But he wasn't tiptoeing.
He was running, running for his life... running in panic until he burst his heart.
Would you mind sorting out a large-scale map of Dartmoor... while I find some more tobacco.
This, I think, is a two-pipe problem.
Come in.
So you finally managed to get here.
I didn't know we'd kept you.
Kept me? I sent for you over 20 minutes ago.
- I think perhaps you've made a mistake.
- I've made a mistake, all right.
The mistake I made was in ever coming to this hotel.
What did you find out about my other boot?
They were both here last night.
But nobody knows: the porter, the maid, the boot boy.
Nobody in this hotel of yours knows where the other one's gone to.
You're the manager.
Perhaps you'll tell me what you do with all your boots.
I'm a few minutes late, I'm afraid.
Those confounded horse buses.
However, I see you've all met, we might as well get down to business.
We have not been given an opportunity to introduce ourselves.
I'm so sorry. Please, let me.
Sir Henry, let me introduce
Mr. Sherlock Holmes...
Dr. Watson. Sir Henry Baskerville.
I'm afraid you're a little late, Mortimer.
I've already managed to make quite a fool of myself.
Gentlemen, I must ask you to accept my apologies.
Dr. Watson. Mr. Holmes.
- How do you do?
- Glad to meet you both.
- I'm sorry if I've embarrassed you.
- Say no more.
- It was quite understandable.
- Yes, indeed.
I hope that the missing boot will turn up very soon.
So do I.
I can understand somebody wanting to steal a pair of boots, but one?
There it is.
- Please, sit down, gentlemen.
- Why, thank you.
Now, Mr. Holmes....
Dr. Mortimer has, no doubt, explained why he's asked us to come here.
He has, and I may as well tell you,
I consider him to have been... somewhat hasty in asking your advice.
Surely, it was only to protect your interests.
He has told you of the legend of the hound of the Baskervilles?
Yes, but I don't attach any importance to that sort of old wives' tale.
A man after my own heart.
You intend to go down to Devonshire and live at Baskerville Hall?
I've already come a very long way to do exactly that... and nothing is going to stop me.
- You can understand that, surely.
- I can indeed.
The estate must be worth a vast amount.
Exactly how much, Dr. Mortimer?
You will forgive me if I ask a very personal question?
- Of course.
- Well?
When everything's settled up,
I suppose, close on £1 million.
Did anyone else benefit under Sir Charles' will?
Yes. He left the
Barrymores £1,000... which I thought was rather generous... and I myself received something.
- How much?
- Is this really necessary?
I would not have asked, otherwise.
Very well.
He left me £40,000.
Then, you see, I was Sir
Charles' best friend.
- Were there no other relatives?
- No.
Sir Henry is the last of the Baskervilles.
That's why I'm anxious to safeguard his interests.
Very wise of you.
One thing is certain, Sir Henry.
On no account must you go down to Devonshire alone.
That's taken care of.
Dr. Mortimer's coming with me.
Dr. Mortimer will have his practice to attend to.
I can look after myself, Mr. Holmes.
I must impress upon you that I believe your life to be in considerable danger.
Now, look, if you attach so much importance to this... why don't you come down to
Dartmoor with me today?
- You can pack before the train leaves.
- You're going today?
I can't possibly leave town until the end of the week at least.
- Watson?
- Yeah.
You're free at the moment, aren't you?
Yes, I am... if you think I could do the job.
You're the very man. That's settled.
You'll go down with him.
We'll keep in touch by telegram.
Sir Henry, I am not a man to overestimate danger... but I must insist upon one thing:
Under no circumstances... are you to venture out onto the moor alone at night.
Very well.
As things have gone this far,
I'll do as you say, for now.
But I'm not yet convinced that I need the services... of a detective at all... unless it'd help me find my other boot.
Sir Henry, keep perfectly still... if you value your life.
Move your head. Carefully.
I can't.
You must.
Leave it to me now.
No! Look after him.
Brandy, Mortimer, quickly.
Here you are.
What a filthy thing. Horrible.
You've had a lucky escape... but we must make certain never to be caught off our guard again.
Are you suggesting that that thing was put in there deliberately?
The powers of evil can take many forms.
Remember that, Sir Henry, when you're at Baskerville Hall.
Do as the legend tells... and avoid the moor when the forces of darkness are exalted.
Are you sure you don't want a ride to the village?
Quite sure. It'll only take you out of your way... whereas it's a short walk across the moor.
You'd be better off to go along with us.
Kindly wait until you're spoken to, and get on with what you're doing.
Whatever you say, but don't blame me if you get your throat cut.
- What are you talking about, man?
- There's been an escape.
- An escape? When?
- Night before last. Man named Selden.
Nasty customer, from all accounts.
What's all this about?
Forgive me, Sir Henry, you wouldn't know about it.
One of our largest prisons, called Dartmoor... lies only seven miles across the moor.
It appears that one of the prisoners has broken out.
Selden. Yes, I remember the case.
He murdered a number of street women.
- I thought people hanged for murder here.
- There was some talk of him being insane... so they sentenced him to life imprisonment instead.
Won't do him no good, though, escaping.
He'd only starve himself to death out there, or something worse.
- What do you mean by that?
- Why, nothing, sir.
Just my foolishness.
I feel you should let us take you into the village.
He might be anywhere out there.
Don't worry about me.
I can look after myself.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
All right, Perkins.
A curse upon the family... unhappiness and death to his descendants.
That's what he left, Sir Henry.
Certainly has a lot to answer for.
What about this one here?
That was another picture of Sir Hugo.
It disappeared under mysterious circumstances some months back.
- You mean it was stolen?
- In the middle of the night.
And what steps were taken to recover it?
Your uncle called in the police from
Exeter, but they could find no trace.
One picture of that scoundrel is more than enough.
What do you say, Watson?
Your glass is empty. Please....
You must be bored to tears by all this rigmarole about my family.
- You must think me a terrible host.
- Not at all.
- I've found it extremely interesting.
- Have you?
It's very nice of you to say so.
- Barrymore.
- Sir?
Would you and your good wife care to join me in a toast?
That's most kind of you, Sir Henry.
Let us drink to my first day at Baskerville Hall... and to my firm belief... that the family curse is nothing but a legend... and that the hound of Hell will never again bring fear... to those on the moor at night.
I must ask you to excuse my wife's behavior, Sir Henry.
She was most upset by
Sir Charles' death.
Her nerves have been in a bad way ever since.
I'm very sorry to hear that.
Watson, can you give her something for her nerves?
Yes. Yes, of course. I will.
Barrymore?
Since you've mentioned
Sir Charles' death... perhaps you could tell us a little more about it.
You were the first to discover the body, weren't you?
That's correct.
It was terrible, sir.
I never saw such a dreadful look on anybody's face before.
You found Sir Charles' body up near the old Abbey, I understand.
What made you go up there to look for him?
I didn't, sir.
I was on my way to tell Dr. Mortimer that he was missing, and then I....
Then I saw Sir Charles lying there dead.
But what made you decide to go across the moor to look for Sir Charles?
I've had a look at a map of the locality... and surely it would've been quicker to have taken the trap and gone by road.
There's a shortcut across the moor, sir.
Barrymore... did you go across the moor because you half expected to find Sir Charles... because of the legend?
You know about the legend of the hound of the Baskervilles, don't you?
Do you believe it?
Do you really believe that there is a creature out there?
I don't know what to believe, sir.
What I know is that
I've heard it... heard its terrible howl on the night before Sir Charles died... and I never want to hear such a sound again in all my life.
- Can I help you, sir?
- No, thank you.
It's got away. Damn it. I could've done with that.
Excellent specimen of
Coleoptera scabrus.
I collect them, you know.
- Why, it's Sir Henry.
- It is.
Yeah, the Baskerville mouth. I could have recognized you anywhere... even among the natives.
Frankland is the name.
Frankland, Bishop of the outer isles... for what they're worth.
Very glad to meet you, sir.
Won't you come in?
Thank you.
Yes. How good.
How very good to see a new owner of Baskerville Hall.
That's not quite what I meant....
Poor Sir Charles.
What a splendid fellow he was.
So you knew my uncle?
Knew him? My dear fellow, we were the greatest friends.
How many times Sir Charles and I have discussed life, you know... over a glass of sherry.
In that case, perhaps you'd care to join me in a glass of sherry now.
Now you've mentioned sherry...
I think perhaps I might like a glass.
I saw Bishop Frankland coming up the drive, Sir Henry.
Barrymore... still the faithful retainer.
Thank you.
- For you, Sir Henry?
- No, thank you, Barrymore.
"That's the best sherry in Devon," I always say.
Sir Charles knew his creature comforts, all right.
Seen him with some very attractive creatures at times.
Yes, he knew a woman when he saw one, did Sir Charles.
Yes. Poor fellow.
May he rest in peace.
What a loss.
Thank you. I think I should like another glass, yes.
Watson, I don't think you've met the Bishop.
- Bishop Frankland, Dr. Watson.
- How do you do?
Watson, you say the name is?
Yes, I knew a Watson in Caprina.
Yes, a notorious white slaver. Nice fellow, though. Relation of yours?
No, sir. Not that I know of.
But, of course, it is possible.
You've come to approve the new
Lord of the manor I imagine?
- It's not necessary.
- Thank you.
But why have I come?
- Yes, of course. The jumble sale.
- Jumble sale? What on earth's that?
It's a colloquial expression,
Sir Henry. A sale of oddments.
And I was wondering if you had anything you could spare for us.
An odd tablecloth or an old suit or some cast-off silver?
I'm sure I can.
I'll ask Mrs. Barrymore.
That's very kind of you.
May I give you the address in which you could have them sent?
I'm sure we shall all be very grateful to you... very grateful, indeed, if you'd have them sent there.
Now, I shan't apologize for the tract.
It's really rather charming.
"All things bright and beautiful."
Thank you.
I'm just going down to the village to leave instructions at the post office.
If you'll excuse me, my Lord Bishop.
Of course. I'd give you a lift on the tricycle but I wanted to chat with Sir Henry.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
I'm afraid you'll be expected to open the sale, Sir Henry... and judge the prettiest mother and baby.
Do you know, dear old Sir
Charles, he loved doing that?
Yeah. He did, indeed.
I remember one occasion when one of the babies wet....
Dear.
Don't move. Stay where you are.
I said not to move, sir.
You've no call to use that kind of trap. It's unnecessarily cruel.
A man's got to live.
There are ways of killing animals without torturing them.
Why don't you use a gun?
- I'm sorry.
- Besides, cartridges cost money.
Some of us haven't got any to spend.
It's a poor life on the moor, Sir Henry.
I'm afraid you've made a mistake.
My name is Watson... though I'm staying at Baskerville Hall.
- With Sir Henry?
- Yes.
Tell the new squire his new neighbor would like to meet him.
I farm the lower pastures near the hall.
Have done for nearly a year.
Poor land it is, too.
- What name is it?
- Stapleton.
Very well. I'll tell Sir Henry.
I wonder, could you tell me how to get to Baskerville Hall?
- I seem to have lost my way.
- You'll bear right at the fork.
Thank you.
Mr. Watson....
Don't step off the track or you'll find yourself in Grimpen Mire.
Once in there, you'll never get out.
Thank you.
Good morning.
I wonder, could you tell me, am I on the right path to Baskerville Hall?
The track seems to end here.
Watch out!
The mire!
I say!
Cecile, come back!
Hold on.
You wait, my girl, I'll teach you to come when I call.
Get the cart down as near here as you can.
Be quick about it. Will you do as you're told, girl?
I told you to watch out.
- Who is that girl?
- My daughter.
The moor's no place for a girl.
- What was she frightened of?
- There's a convict escaped from the prison.
I'll help you to the cart.
Watch where I step.
Thank you.
Now that you're here, would you like to come in and see Sir Henry?
- It's as good a time as any.
- How about Miss Stapleton?
- Would she like to come in, too?
- She'll wait where she is.
Very well.
Well, good morning, Miss Stapleton.
Hello.
If you're looking for the new owner, he's not at home.
Go away.
I haven't introduced myself yet.
I'm Henry Baskerville.
- May I ask...
- Please, go away.
My father will be out in a moment.
So your father's gone into the hall?
- Let's join him.
- No. Don't.
Here. You wait a minute.
- Leave me alone!
- Just a minute! Calm down!
Now, why did you run away?
Why did you run away?
I've done nothing to frighten you.
- My father.
- What about your father?
- He would have seen us.
- What of it?
Now, would you let me go?
Cecile!
Where have you been?
Come on, girl. Where have you been?
- Good morning.
- Morning.
- Sir Henry Baskerville, isn't it?
- Yes.
I've been looking forward to meeting you.
My name is Stapleton.
Welcome to Dartmoor.
- You're very kind.
- I run the home farm.
You'll be very welcome whenever you're that way.
We must be getting on our way, mustn't we, Cecile?
- Good day to you, sir.
- Good day.
Come on!
Watson, here.
Move the candle about. Quickly.
I swear I saw a light out there on the moor as soon as you picked up the candle.
Someone out there is signaling to the house. Come.
Whatever happens, Sir Henry, you must stay with me.
- We're still in line with the light.
- Yes, but we're not near enough yet.
Keep close to me. Don't go off left, or you'll be in Grimpen Mire.
Right?
Come on.
Come out! We're armed!
They've gone.
Whoever they are, they must have heard us.
Watson!
Come on! There's still a chance.
No, no. Quiet. Listen.
He's down there somewhere.
What was that, Watson?
What was that?
It's my heart.
Drink some of this.
Will you be able to get back if I help you?
I'll try.
Come on, then.
That is for me to decide, Sir Henry.
I suggest that you have a little rest.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I really don't know why you bothered to send for me.
After all, as a doctor, you're just as capable as I am.
Does your diagnosis confirm mine?
He has a similar heart condition to his uncle, agreed.
Hereditary, no doubt, but nowhere near so far advanced.
All the same, I'd like to leave him in your charge until I get back.
If you insist.
Anyway, my night's sleep is ruined, but
I really can't see that it's necessary.
Nevertheless, I'd appreciate it if you would stay.
It's essential that I go back to the moor.
All right. I'll stay.
Why have you left Sir Henry alone?
Holmes.
I repeat, why have you left Sir Henry alone?
Dr. Mortimer is with him.
- Anyone else?
- Yes. The Barrymores.
Very well, then.
Forgive me if my dramatic entrance startled you.
It's good to see you again.
It's been rather lonely up here.
This is fantastic.
How long have you been in Devon?
Four hours and 52 minutes less than you.
I caught the next train down after yours.
But your telegram...
I wrote that before I left town and had it delivered later.
So it was you I saw.
You might have let me know what you intended to do.
I'm sorry, but I didn't want it known I was here.
You would have tried to prevent me.
- You will understand, I had to find Selden.
- Selden, the convict?
- That was madness.
- No doubt, but effectual.
- How did you know he was on the moor?
- I read about it in the newspapers.
The escape was well-reported.
I'm surprised you didn't notice it.
He told me all he had seen since he's been hiding.
What had he seen?
What did he tell you?
There is more evil around us here than I have ever encountered before.
I still don't see...
Mortimer's gone.
His ponycart's not there.
- You told him to stay with Sir Henry?
- Indeed, I did.
Which way? For heaven's sake, which way?
Too late.
- We're too late.
- Sir Henry.
Watch out, Holmes.
It's treacherous here.
We must go back and get help, then come back for the body.
I'm to blame for this.
- I shall never forgive myself.
- I warned him.
What could have possessed him to come out alone on the moor?
The last of the Baskervilles.
His life was in our hands.
I shall not rest until I destroy the thing that killed him.
- You're Barrymore, I take it.
- Yes, sir.
Barrymore, I want you to get a ladder, some rope, and lanterns... and load them on the cart within five minutes.
You understand?
- Yes, sir.
- Good.
- Where's your room?
- This way. I'll show you.
And have those attended to, will you?
Very good, sir.
I'll need a pair of dry stud boots and a heavy coat before we go out again.
Yes, of course.
You know, Holmes, I can't help feeling that if I hadn't left Sir Henry alone...
We're to avenge his death, not mourn over it.
No. This way.
Who's there?
Holmes. For heaven's sake, when did you get here?
I am glad to see you again.
I am more than glad to see you, Sir Henry.
Who was it, Holmes?
Who was the poor devil that died instead of me?
If my deductions are correct, it was the convict, Selden.
He was a murderer, I know, but he shouldn't have died that way.
But why him? The curse is only on the Baskervilles. Is no one safe?
Selden had on the suit you were wearing when we met in London.
- How did he get them?
- He must've broken in and stolen them.
Possibly, but unlikely.
Sir Henry... why did Dr. Mortimer leave so suddenly tonight?
He told me that he'd stay until I got back.
Stupid row, really.
He kept on about my uncle's death and the curse on the family, and...
I asked if he was trying to frighten me and told him to mind his business.
I should like a few words with Dr. Mortimer sometime.
Excuse me, Sir Henry. Is there anything else you require?
No, thank you, Barrymore, not as far as I'm concerned.
- You've prepared a room for Mr. Holmes?
- Yes, sir.
Will you still be needing the ladder and rope you asked for tonight, sir?
No. Not now.
But I shall want them and your help in the morning.
Very good, sir.
- Barrymore.
- Sir?
That room at the end of the corridor upstairs:
Has it been used lately?
- Not for some time, sir.
- I see.
I think you'll find a candle burning near the window in that room.
Do kindly extinguish it. It's serving no useful purpose.
- Very good, sir.
- Thank you.
And now, with your permission, to bed.
Yes. We could all do with a good night's sleep.
This, I perceive, is Sir Hugo Baskerville, the man who started all the trouble.
Yes, it is. How the devil did you know?
Family likeness. There are certain features that are unmistakable.
What happened to the picture that hung here?
That one? Nobody knows.
It disappeared some time ago.
Yes.
Yes, of course. It had to.
Stupid of me.
Yes. Good night.
That's strange. There's nothing there.
I could have sworn that that was the spot.
It must be more over this way.
No, Watson. You were right.
This was the place. Look at this.
Here's another trace... and another.
You can see where they're leading to.
- Barrymore!
- Sir?
Tell Perkins to bring the cart up to the ruins, then follow us.
- Yes, sir.
- We won't find the body down here.
By heavens, what's been going on here?
The Baskerville crest, engraved on the hilt.
Mr. Holmes!
As I thought. Selden.
His body's been mutilated.
Some revolting sacrificial rite has been performed.
- What depths a human being can sink to.
- What human being could have done this?
That is precisely what
I intend to find out.
- You rang for me, sir?
- I did, Mrs. Barrymore. Sit down, please.
- No, thank you, sir. I prefer to stand.
- As you wish.
I want to ask you and your husband a few questions, if you don't mind.
- How long have you been married?
- Married?
- Must be almost five years now, isn't it?
- Is that right, Miss Selden?
Yes, sir. We got married about...
Please, sit down.
Your name was Selden before you married, wasn't it?
And the convict who escaped was your brother?
- How did you know?
- Your brother told me.
- He's dead, sir, isn't he?
- Yes, I'm afraid he is.
How did it happen?
You gave Selden some of Sir
Henry's clothes, didn't you?
Well, I....
Someone, or something... mistook your brother for Sir Henry.
You mustn't blame my husband, sir.
I gave him the clothes.
Sir Henry said I might take them for the village sale.
Buy why should they have them... when my brother was out on the moor, cold and hungry?
Thank you, sir.
I know he was bad, sir, but he was ill, really... and he was my brother.
You can't leave someone you love out there, cold and starving.
I understand. It might help you to know he also told me... he would never let them recapture him alive.
Come along, my dear.
Poor woman.
I suppose when Sir Henry and
I arrived here at the hall... she found it difficult to get food to her brother.
They arranged a signal with the candle at the window... to show him the coast was clear.
Couldn't they be charged with helping an escaped convict?
They could, but they won't.
I've satisfied the local police.
What's the next move?
"All things bright and beautiful, all creatures great and small."
I wonder if that includes tarantulas.
Tarantulas?
But, Holmes....
- A gentlemen to see you, my lord.
- Good, good. Just in time.
Yes, I'm still having trouble with it.
Will you come and have a look at it?
Of course, I'm not an engineering man, but it seems this eccentric is malaligned.
Or perhaps if this cam were buffed to another thou or so... it might make all the difference, don't you think?
- Or perhaps a shim.
- Graphite grease.
What?
Of course, yes. I have got some.
- Do you know, I never thought of it?
- Allow me.
Thank you.
Yes. Silly of me.
- Yes.
- Thank you.
There you are.
You'll want that. Yeah.
Now let's see.
Wonderful, wonderful.
That's done the trick, yeah.
I wish Mrs. Goodliffe would leave those windows alone.
Never mind. Take a glass of sherry before you go.
- Bishop Frankland, I...
- Nonsense.
A little wine, for your stomach's sake. That's in the Bible.
I think you'll like this.
What do I owe you for your trouble, and your fare from Exeter, of course?
My Lord, you've mistaken me for someone else.
No. Only somebody from
Warburton and Crawley... could have solved that problem.
Nevertheless, I am not from
Warburton and Crawley.
- Not?
- My name is Sherlock Holmes.
I am staying with Sir
Henry Baskerville.
Allow me to shake the hand of the country's greatest detective.
That case of the Bermondsey forgery, that was first class.
Thank you. And I am pleased to meet our most distinguished entomologist.
You've heard of me? How flattering.
I know the directors of the Regents Zoo... regard you as the highest living authority on the study of rare spiders.
Spiders?
It is about that subject that I have come to see you.
- The species of the genus Theraphosa.
- Tarantula.
Everybody's asking me about tarantulas these days.
No.
I'm afraid I can't help you on that subject.
How very disappointing... because I've found one.
- Found one? Have you, by Jove?
- Dead, fortunately.
Pity. Never mind.
Where did you find it, somewhere about the village?
- No. In London.
- Up there.
Nevertheless... it was the same spider that you lost.
No, impossible. Far too far away.
Are you suggesting that
I've lost a spider?
I'm afraid I am.
You have, haven't you?
You lost a spider sent to you from the London Zoo about five days ago.
- Are you interested in butterflies?
- My Lord, I must insist.
Will it help if I tell you I am fighting evil, fighting it as surely as you do?
Yes. Very well. I did lose a tarantula.
I missed it last Thursday. I've been worried out of my life ever since.
They're dangerous.
So I understand. But you needn't worry any longer. The spider is dead.
Now, it is important that you answer this question correctly.
What visitors did you have on the day you missed the tarantula?
Visitors?
That's difficult because
Thursday's my at-home day.
I mean, a lot of people like to look in for sherry and a chat.
Let me see. There was old Mrs. Smythe.
Poor woman. Drinks.
Yes. Dr. Mortimer before lunch.
Dear old Mortimer. How he talks.
The Stapletons to tea.
The man about the woodworm in the belfry.
Fascinating little creatures. But the church is full of them, you know?
I'm extremely sorry to hear that.
And the man's name?
- Smith, I think.
- And no one else?
Last Thursday? No.
Thank you, my Lord, that is all I wish to know.
It has been most kind of you and most helpful.
And thank you for helping me with my telescope.
- Not at all.
- Remarkable instrument.
It's surprising what you can see through a good telescope.
Now, what's going on in the big world?
There's Sir Henry.
Where's he off to?
Dear me, this is very interesting.
Come have a look.
Come here. Come have a look.
He's gone.
Anybody at home?
Mr. Stapleton?
Why did you come here?
I'm sorry. You must think me very rude, but I did knock.
I've come to see your father.
He's not here. He's gone to Baskerville Hall.
Has he? May I ask why?
To invite you and your friends to dinner tonight.
That's very kind of him.
Would you like some cider?
Thank you very much. I would.
What time are we expected to arrive?
You mean, you will come?
I'm looking forward to it.
It won't be like Baskerville Hall.
I haven't spent all my life at Baskerville Hall, Cecile.
- I like your home.
- This is not my home.
My home is in Spain.
You were looking at the picture of my parents.
My mother was a fine woman... a fine Spanish woman.
She would hear nothing of living in England.
She was born in Spain, and there she would die, she said.
She did die.
We came here to England.
My father spent all the money we had saved... to come back to England to become a gentleman farmer in his own country.
But the land he bought is no good.
The money's gone.
We have a saying at home:
"Weeds are not killed by the frost."
We still live.
- Have you ever thought of going back?
- I've thought of nothing else.
My father's too proud to admit he's beaten.
Proud of this.
And so we are left with the moor and the mist.
- You must be very lonely.
- Yes, I am very lonely.
When you are poor, no one wants to know you.
I want to know you, Cecile.
Why did you run away from me yesterday, when we'd hardly met?
Why did you kiss me, Cecile?
Why?
I don't know.
- Tell me.
- I don't know.
Will you meet me tonight at the hall?
We can walk back across the moor.
If you want me to.
Our paths seem to have crossed this morning, Sir Henry.
I suppose you've come to talk about the farm.
You have cider? Good. Cecile, fetch another tankard for me.
Now, quickly about it, girl.
Do sit down, Sir Henry.
Thank you.
I was wondering if you and your guests would care to join us for a meal tonight?
- Just simple fare, of course.
- Yes, so your daughter's already told me.
I'd be very pleased to. So will
Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson.
Good. It will be a change for us to have visitors.
To your health, sir.
But how can you be so certain that someone took one of the bishop's spiders... and deliberately placed it in Sir Henry's room... that it wasn't in his luggage from South Africa?
Elementary, my dear Watson. There are no tarantulas in South Africa.
Whoever placed it there didn't know that.
Precisely.
But he did know when and where
Sir Henry was arriving... and where he'd be staying.
He also knew a great deal about the Baskerville family.
A bite from a tarantula is not necessarily deadly to a healthy man... but to a man with a weak heart....
That points to somebody from this part of the country.
Why not?
There's an fine train service to and from London... and as Sir Charles died here only a month ago... it's less suspicious for Sir
Henry to die in London.
Sir Charles, I'd almost forgotten about him.
- It's a good thing I remembered, wasn't it?
- All right.
But the person who benefited most from his will was Sir Henry.
You're not going to suggest that he killed his uncle?
£1 million is a great temptation.
In a case such as this, everyone is suspect, even Sir Henry.
Dr. Mortimer was the only one who knew where Sir Henry would be in London... and when he was arriving.
No. No. The London Times would have published it.
What about the legend of the hound of Hell?
Remember, we've both seen something of its horror.
Watson! You inspire me!
Let me see your map, quickly.
Selden swore he heard his cries coming from the very depths of the Earth.
The hound of Hell. Let me see.
Really, I must pull myself together.
I should have noticed this long ago.
Holmes. Barrymore told me you'd arrived.
And about time, too, if I may say so... considering what happened to that convict fellow last night.
A development I deeply regret, Dr. Mortimer.
I don't.
A man like that deserves all he gets.
In case you're both wondering why I'm here...
I've just come over to start looking through the family estate.
I think I'm wasting my time, if you ask me.
You know, really, Holmes...
I find it quite impossible to get on with Sir Henry.
I understand you had a disagreement with him last night.
Disagreement?
He was downright rude, if that's what you mean.
Hardly an excuse to leave him alone when you know he's in danger.
You told me you'd stay with
Sir Henry until I got back.
What if I did?
I don't see why I should be insulted by the man I'm trying to protect.
After all, I only mentioned the subject of the legend.
Now, you are very fond of doing that, Dr. Mortimer. Why?
Weren't you the first to discover the existence of the legend?
Mr. Holmes... when I engaged you...
I looked to you to protect
Sir Henry's interests.
I'm beginning to see, for the first time in my life, I was wrong in my judgment.
- If you care to relinquish the case...
- I never relinquish!
- Mr. Holmes...
- Please, don't let us fall out at this stage.
I need your help, unfortunately.
You know a lot about the geography and history of this district, I believe.
I am considered something of an authority.
There's an old tin mine marked here on the map.
- Does it still exist?
- I believe so.
What of it? It's been derelict for years.
Yes, I rather fear this map a wee out of date.
Could you show me the way to the entrance?
What on earth for?
Could you?
I'm afraid not.
I haven't been near there for years.
Perhaps Stapleton can help you.
It lies under his ground.
If he agreed to show me, would you come with us?
I suggest that you stay away from the mine, Mr. Holmes.
It hasn't been in use for a long time, the shaft is in a dangerous condition.
How do you know, if you haven't been there for years?
It's obvious, isn't it?
Any tunneling is dangerous if it isn't in a state of repair.
Still, I feel I must take a look at it. Will you come with me?
As an archeologist, your help will be invaluable.
I suppose, if you're going to make an issue of it, I shall have to come.
- Good. Good man.
- What do you want me to do?
Identify anything I may find.
Strange things are to be found on the moor.
Like this, for instance!
- Where did you find that?
- Interesting, isn't it?
Could you tell me how old it is?
I'm not sure.
- About 1700, I imagine.
- 1740, to be exact.
And the blood, how old is that?
I couldn't tell.
Then I will tell you. It is less than 10 hours old.
Could you tell me anything else about the weapon?
No? Come, come.
With your knowledge of the legend,
I made certain you ought to know.
It's the dagger Sir Hugo used to murder the girl in the abbey.
And more recently, it has been used for some diabolical ceremony.
All right, Watson, we're all down quite safely.
Good! I'll be waiting for you here!
I don't expect we shall be very long.
You'd both better follow close behind me for the moment.
You'll have to watch your step.
It's very slippery down here.
The water seeps through from the mire.
Don't touch any of the props, whatever you do!
We'll have the whole roof down on us.
We should never have come down here. It's far too dangerous.
What do you expect to find, Mr. Holmes?
What is one likely to find under the ground?
Bones, perhaps.
This is dangerous.
You carry on, Mr. Holmes, while we chock the wheels.
- Certainly.
- Here you are.
Thank you.
We won't need to go any further.
I've found what I came down for.
No good, Watson?
Leave the lanterns there, Mr. Stapleton.
We must go to the village and get some help.
I'm afraid it won't do no good, sir.
Must be a ton of rock blocking that shaft there.
We must try.
You must resign yourself to the fact that there's no hope of him being alive.
- Don't you agree, Stapleton?
- You know as much about it as I do.
It's over two hours since the roof fell.
You've been down there.
We've heard nothing.
Not likely to, with all that rock in front of us.
That don't mean to say he's not alive.
Plenty of air in that old mine. Comes in from them ventilating shafts.
Couldn't we get down one of them and find him that way?
I wouldn't like to say, sir.
I doubt there's a man as knows them entrances.
We must try to find one.
Mr. Stapleton, will you lead us back to the path immediately, please?
I did warn him not to go.
You were there. You heard me, didn't you?
- There's still a chance.
- A very good chance.
I've been waiting for you for the last 10 minutes.
Holmes!
- Thank heaven you're safe.
- How did you get out? This is wonderful.
That's gratifying.
When the applause has died down,
I wonder if we could get back to the hall.
I've hurt my leg, I'm cold, and I'm hungry.
Will you please stop behaving like a maiden aunt.
If I hadn't known there were a number of entrances to the mine...
- ...I'd never have gone down.
- But for a wretched old beef bone...
It is not a wretched old beef bone.
That's just the point.
It's a relatively new one.
- But I...
- No buts.
Would you mind, please, passing me my tobacco?
- Where is it?
- You'll find it in the top right-hand drawer.
An unopened tin.
- You must have put it somewhere else.
- The right-hand top drawer.
- I'm looking in the right-hand top drawer.
- Isn't it there?
I've just told you it isn't there.
Here it is.
Just a minute. I know I put it there this morning.
Watson, the bottom drawer, where I put the dagger... is it still locked?
No.
Holmes, the lock's been forced!
The dagger's not there.
Watson.
How's the leg feeling now?
- Not very good.
- I'm sorry to hear that.
I wasn't able to tell you before... but Stapleton has asked us over for a meal tonight.
- Has he?
- Yes. I thought it was a very nice gesture.
Still, I don't suppose you'll feel like going with your leg the way it is.
No, I don't.
They'll be very disappointed, and
Cecile is waiting for me downstairs.
Of course, I wouldn't dream of going without you.
My dear Sir Henry, if you'd wanted us to come with you... you'd have told us about the invitation much sooner than this.
I beg your pardon?
You'd better be off. You mustn't be late for your peasant friends.
- I don't like that, Holmes.
- I don't like the people you're mixing with.
I thought, in your new position, you would've cultivated worthier friends.
I hope you enjoy their rabbit pie.
Mr. Holmes, I appreciate the fact that you are here to help me.
Nevertheless, I would remind you that you are also a guest in my house.
- Good night!
- Good night.
- I do think you might...
- Do stop talking nonsense.
You know my methods.
Couldn't you see I was being purposely rude?
I wanted him to go without us.
The dagger's gone.
Don't you realize what that means?
Sir Henry is to die tonight!
Are you sure your leg is all right?
It's got to be, if we're to break the curse he laid on the Baskervilles.
- Holmes?
- Yes.
You learned something from that portrait that I never saw.
The hands, Watson. Why do you think this painting was stolen?
Because the artist revealed both hands.
Barrymore's confirmed what I suspected.
The fingers of Sir Hugo's right hand were webbed.
- Stapleton.
- Exactly. Stapleton.
Illegitimate descendent of Sir Hugo, next in line to the Baskerville fortune.
- No. This way.
- But this is the way to the farm.
Come on.
Swine!
You thought it was going to be easy, didn't you? Didn't you?
You won't be the first of your family who thought that... and you won't be the first to die because of it.
Remember the legend?
Sir Hugo died here.
His throat was torn out because of a girl.
And Sir Charles, your dear uncle, he died here, didn't he?
Died because he wanted me, like you.
Died because he wanted a woman enough to bring me here alone at night... in spite of the hound of the Baskervilles.
He died screaming.
I know. I watched him.
And now you are here alone... at night.
You don't understand, do you?
Then let me explain.
I, too, am a Baskerville, descended from Sir Hugo... descended from those who died in poverty while you scum ruled the moor.
We have waited and prayed for this moment, my father and I.
Now our time has come, and yours.
The curse of the hound is on you.
No, Watson! She won't get far.
Attend to Sir Henry.
All right.
All right, Sir Henry.
The hound is dead, and you must see it, sir.
No, I don't....
It is best that you should.
There is nothing to fear now.
There's a passage leading from the mine to this place.
I discovered it after Stapleton tried to kill me down there.
They used this mask to make it look more terrifying.
He was starved for weeks, kept in the mine till the time was ripe... then given the scent.
They had to have something of yours to give the hound.
We'd better get Sir Henry back to Baskerville Hall.
Have you got your cape?
Would you get it for me?
- So the curse has claimed its last victim.
- Yes.
No more will be heard of the hound of the Baskervilles.
I feel I have already suffered enough from my infamous ancestor... and so....
"And so I am sending you the missing portrait...
"which we found at Stapleton's farm to add to your collection of souvenirs.
"I hope you will accept it, also the check which I enclose for..."
Very generous.
After tea, you must write to Sir
Henry that I should be pleased... to accept both his gifts.
Tell me, Holmes... when did you first suspect the truth about this case?
- The truth?
- Yes, that the hound was a real dog... and not just a legendary myth.
When Sir Henry complained of a missing boot... that put me on the scent, as it were.
As early as that.
That's incredible.
It's elementary, my dear Watson.
A muffin?
Thank you.
- What's the score, Doc?
- Twins. Cutest things you ever saw.
Hey, they're keeping you busy these days.
It's the desert. Gives people wonderful ideas.
- Check the ship, will you?
- You betcha.
Hiya, Doc. Phone's been ringing like crazy for you.
Sheriff's half out of his mind.
- Call him for me, will you, Josh?
- Yeah.
- I'm ringing him, Doc.
- That's fine.
- He's on, Doc.
- Thanks, Josh.
Hello, Jack. What's up?
Can you come over right away, Doc?
I hate to bother you.
I know you've been up all night, but this is important.
Okay.
Doc, sure sounded worried, didn't he?
Someday, you old codger, you're going to hear something you won't like.
Are you inferring that
I was listening in?
Yeah.
Hi, Jack. What's all the excitement about? Who's sick?
- Nobody.
- Huh?
The boys found a man near the highway this morning.
- Run over?
- No.
- Well, then?
- That's why I called you, Doc.
- What's it look like?
- Like nothing I've ever seen before.
Who is it?
Well, he has the same general build as Eric Jacobs, but I'm not sure.
I don't follow you.
There's something about his face says he's Jacobs... but maybe he ain't.
Look, Jack, I'm lost.
You remember Jacobs, don't you?
Yeah, he's the biologist.
Works for Prof. Deemer.
Met him a couple of years ago.
He's over at the undertaker's.
You'd better have a look.
- Hi, Charlie.
- Hi, Charlie.
I phoned Deemer right away.
He said he'd be over to see if this is him.
You know Deemer, don't you?
Yeah. When I opened my office I went out to pay my respects.
He was polite enough... but I had the feeling I wasn't welcome, so I never went back.
Some of these big brains never learnt manners.
Here he is, Barney.
- Hi, Doc.
- Hello, Barney.
You figure this one out and you're good.
Now you know why I'm not sure.
That's not Jacobs. This man has had the disease for years.
I saw Jacobs last month.
He looked okay then.
They're in the back room, Professor.
It's Eric, all right.
He was my friend for 30 years.
You better come outside, Professor.
Yes.
- You all through in there?
- Yeah.
Leave us alone for a minute, will you, Barney?
Yeah, sure.
Professor, I have to know all about it.
Why he looks that way, why he was missing.
Sheriff, have you ever watched... a friend dying before your eyes and not been able to help?
That's the worst of it.
Being helpless.
It's particularly tough when you're a physician... and you know what's wrong with him.
And there isn't a single solitary thing you or anyone else can do.
When I saw the body,
I though it was acromegalia.
But that's not possible.
Acromegalia?
The pituitary gland goes haywire, Jack.
It distorts the face, neck, hands, and feet.
I met Jacobs a couple of years ago at your place.
The sheriff saw him about a month ago. He looked normal then.
It is acromegalia.
But in every case
I've ever heard of... it's taken years to produce the deformity.
I know.
The history of medicine is the history of the unusual.
Perhaps Eric had been ill for years. Who knows?
But it was only four days ago that he began to complain of muscular pains.
Neither of us thought too much about it.
These things happen as you grow older.
And the next morning he began to...
To change.
Maybe we'd better do an autopsy just to make sure.
I don't think that'll be necessary.
I was in attendance, and I signed the death certificate.
I see.
How come we found him on the desert?
Dr. Jacobs became delirious last night.
Broke out of the house and ran into the desert.
Are you certain he hadn't complained of anything before that time?
There's nothing I can add to what I've already said.
Eric had no family. I'll arrange for the funeral.
Thank you for calling me so promptly.
- Goodbye, Dr. Hastings.
- Professor.
Acromegalia.
- You heard the man.
- I sure did.
A young fellow like you can't stack what he knows against the professor.
The trouble is, Doc, you hate to admit you're wrong.
We all make mistakes, Jack.
This isn't one of mine.
Hello.
There we go.
- Paul!
- Eric is dead. Do you hear me?
There's just you and me... and we're going to die, too.
No, Paul! Keep away from me!
I'm trying to help you. Paul!
Coco, you startled me.
So you escaped the fire?
Let me see those paws.
I'll have to do something about those burns, won't I?
Come on, Coco.
You've got that look like you swallowed the canary.
Not at all.
If there's anything a man hates it's to be told he's wrong when he knows he's right.
I knew Deemer had burnt your tail.
Listen, I'm just a country doctor, but I know what I know.
And I know acromegalia doesn't turn up in four days out of left field.
So?
So I went to the medical library in Phoenix and read up on it.
There wasn't one single recorded case in medical history... where a malformation developed as fast as Deemer said Jacobs' did.
- You mean he was lying to us?
- I don't know.
But I'd like to know why he was in such a hurry to bury Jacobs... and why he didn't want me to do an autopsy.
The man's an M.D. Like you.
He's entitled to his opinion.
Or do you want me to charge him with confusing a country doctor?
There's nothing like the safety of prestige, is there, Sheriff?
Let's skip it.
Everything's clean and legal... and I wouldn't want you to stick your neck out for anything.
What do you want me to do?
Pinch him because I don't like the way he parts his hair?
Have you ever asked yourself what Deemer and Jacobs... were working on in their lab?
No, and I don't intend to jimmy open a window to find out, either.
Deemer's speciality is nutrient biology.
Jacobs is a leader in the same field.
Now when two big shots like that get together... and hole up in the desert,
20 miles from civilization...
I'd say they might be working on something... they're not too anxious to talk about.
You think whatever they might be doing ties in with what killed Jacobs?
I wish I knew.
Oh, oh.
Joe Burch is on the warpath again.
- What'd you do this time?
- I forgot to tell him about Jacobs.
Well, good day, my very, very good friends.
A fine pair you turned out to be.
I practically had the paper put to bed... when I found out about
Jacobs by accident.
Well, I'm sorry, Joe. It slipped my mind.
What do you want to know?
Only what I haven't found out for myself.
I sneaked a look at the death certificate over at Barney's.
Got the personal dope on him out of Who's Who.
How often does this acromegalia occur, Doc?
Not very. First time I've seen it, as a matter of fact.
My dictionary says it's chronic, it doesn't mention death.
Well, death doesn't usually come from the disease itself.
It's caused by suffocation.
What do you mean, suffocation?
The tongue becomes enlarged.
The throat, the thorax, the heart... everything gets pushed out of place.
What do you think Deemer's been working on out there?
That I'd like to know.
I'll hop out with Ridley, grab a couple of pictures, and see what I can find out.
By the way, Doc... how long had Jacobs been dead when our friend here remembered to call you?
- Will you lay off?
- Eight or ten hours.
Thanks, Doc. I'll be sure to spell your name right.
As for your friend, it might just slip my mind... to support him the next time he comes up for election.
Say, that's a good idea, Jack.
Him going out to Deemer's.
Joe will get him so riled up with questions, he may take to me.
If you go into the hotel, miss, they'll tell you the best way to get there.
Thank you.
I wonder if you might tell me the best way to get out to the Deemer place?
- It's about...
- I know where it is.
Is there a bus or cab available?
Well, yes, but there won't be any buses through anymore today.
Then would you mind calling a cab for me?
I wouldn't mind it a bit.
But it wouldn't do no good.
Because Jasper, you see, it's his cab.
He's out at the Bar Six and won't be back for a couple of hours.
Maybe longer.
Well, what'll I do?
Sit down and wait.
That's all you can do.
Thank you.
You ain't come through here before, have you?
No.
Didn't think I'd seen you.
You any kin to this man, Deemer?
No, I'm not.
He any kin to you? Oh, no.
- I don't suppose that...
- I doubt it.
Me, too.
Josh, I'm expecting a call from Dan Simon.
Switch it to the Deemer place, will you?
You going out there?
- Just leaving.
- Take her with you.
Well, you see, I was asking how to get out there, but...
Well, I wouldn't want to impose on you.
He won't mind.
No, I'd be glad to drive you.
- Well, if you're sure.
- Are these yours?
Hey.
Ain't you two going to introduce yourselves?
- No.
- No.
Getting to be a fast world.
Think it's about time?
- Dr. Matt Hastings.
- Stephanie Clayton. "Steve."
I like Steve.
I'm really indebted to you,
Dr. Hastings, for this ride.
Or rather, I'm indebted to your friend Josh.
So am I.
I guess it's none of my business asking why you're going out to Deemer's place, but...
Why not?
I'm doing graduate work in biology.
The professor teaches it, or he did.
I knew it would happen.
Give women the vote and what do you get? Lady scientists.
Well, student so far.
You see, I wrote a paper on the nutritional aspects of expanding populations... and Prof. Jacobs read it and offered me a job for the summer.
How about a place to live?
There are a couple of nice boarding houses in Desert Rock.
- Cost less than a hotel.
- Well, no.
I'm going to stay at the professor's.
You see, it's all part of my contract.
I'll be laboratory technician, cook, student. The whole works.
I see.
Well, it's one way of earning a master's.
And it's worth it working with people like Deemer and Prof. Jacobs.
- How well did you know Eric Jacobs?
- I've never met him.
He just read the paper and liked it, and that was that.
He's dead.
Died yesterday morning.
How?
Glandular condition called acromegalia.
Acromegalia? Isn't that a very rare disease?
Extremely.
Are you sure it was that?
No, I'm not sure at all.
He has a wonderful lab here.
One of the best.
Looks like nobody's home.
There must be someone. That's
Joe Burch's car over there.
Might as well.
The electric panel shorted.
And, well, you can see for yourself.
You estimated the amount of damage yet, Professor?
The greatest damage, of course, was to the work that was destroyed.
Let's get back to Jacobs.
- Why did he leave...
- I've told you all there is.
Will you gentlemen excuse me?
One more picture.
- Pat the monkey, Professor.
- I said that was all.
I think that ought to be enough, Joe.
- Professor's had a rough couple of days.
- Yes. Thank you, Dr. Hastings.
Thanks for the story, Professor.
I didn't mean to add to your troubles.
Come on, Ridley.
- See you later, Matt.
- See you, Joe.
I thought I'd never get rid of them.
You must forgive an old man.
- Have I met you before, miss?
- No.
This is Stephanie Clayton. It seems
Prof. Jacobs wrote for an assistant.
- She's it.
- Yes, Eric told me you were coming.
But I didn't expect to see a biologist that looked like you.
That was intended as a compliment.
- I'm afraid I've gotten a bit rusty.
- Well, thank you, sir.
Well, I don't know that you'll want to stay on with all that has happened...
You're welcome to, of course.
But Eric...
I know. Dr. Hastings told me on the way out.
I see.
Well, with Eric gone, I'm alone.
I'm sure I can be of service.
I mean, if you're going to continue with your work.
Yes, indeed. For Eric's sake, if nothing else.
Wasn't Paul Lund working with you, Prof. Deemer?
Paul...
Yes, he was studying for his doctorate... when I was a freshman.
- I'd heard he came here.
- Yes, of course.
Paul Lund. No, he's not with us anymore.
Well, come now, Miss Clayton.
Let me show you my lab.
- Are you interested at all, Doctor?
- Yes, of course.
I've put all I own into this.
It's my life.
Everything that I have and care for is here.
Unfortunately, part of it has been destroyed.
I see.
What's in the vial, Professor?
- A nutrient.
- You mean a synthetic?
A completely nonorganic food concentrate.
Medicine has lengthened the life span, and people live longer.
But the food supply remains fairly static.
World population is increasing at the rate of 25 million a year.
An overcrowded world.
That means not enough to eat.
The disease of hunger, like most diseases, well, it spreads.
There are 2 billion people in the world today.
In 1975 there will be 3 billion.
In the year 2000, there will be 3 billion 625 million.
The world may not be able to produce enough food to feed all these people.
Now perhaps you'll understand what an inexpensive nutrient will mean.
Well, not many of us look that far into the future, sir.
Our business is the future.
No man can do it on his own, of course.
You don't pull it out of your hat like a magician's rabbit.
Well, you build on what hundreds of others have learnt before you.
I thought that synthesis was impossible without a bonding agent... to hold everything together.
And we use the simplest of all: The atom.
Let me show you.
- That's an isotope, isn't it?
- A radioactive isotope.
Ammoniac.
- And that's what binds your solution?
- Binds it and triggers it.
Using it, Eric's dream and mine may be a reality before...
Excuse me.
Hello?
Yes.
It's for you, Doctor.
Thank you.
Hello? Hi, Josh.
Of course.
Call her back. Tell her I'll stop by on my way home.
Bye.
Sorry to break this up.
Thanks for the tour, Professor.
Maybe one of these days you'll invite me back.
Why, yes, of course.
Professor, I...
I'm still puzzled by the speed with which Jacobs' malformation developed.
Can you explain it?
Eric is dead and he shouldn't be.
But the cause was acromegalia. Nothing else.
It seems such a deviation from the classic cases.
You're being very diplomatic, Doctor.
Why don't you speak up?
Don't you think, sir, this time you might be wrong?
In this case, no.
You want to do an autopsy. Why don't you?
- Well, you objected.
- I was upset.
Eric was not only my colleague, he was my closest friend.
- You have my permission.
- Well, thank you, sir.
I'll let you know what I find.
And please, don't forget to invite me back?
- Well, now I'll show you to your quarters.
- All right.
- That you, Jack?
- How're you coming?
Be right with you.
What you got?
I'll give it to you fast, Jack. Nothing.
Nothing? You mean the professor was right?
Couldn't have been more right.
Well, how do you like that?
You make a big thing out of it, show
Deemer up for maybe a murderer and then...
You want me to go ahead with the interment, Jack?
You might as well before this amateur gumshoe gets any more bright ideas.
The case is closed.
And the next time I need a doctor,
I'll call one in from Phoenix.
You know, I don't think Jack's too happy about all this.
I don't blame him.
But I still can't figure it out.
Slowly, slow.
That's good.
Take your time, Steve, take your time.
We have nothing except time.
And we won't have that if we make a mistake.
There.
- Am I doing all right, Professor?
- Fine!
Now lift the lid onto the vial.
Easy.
That's it. Now lift up the graduated glass... and put it in the access chamber.
Well done, Steve.
Now lift up the chamber.
That's it.
Now we'll take this into the dry box... where we can handle it safely.
You're getting quite expert at this.
I don't know what
I'd do without you.
Now let's see how we make out.
It's one thing to develop a formula on paper, another to make it work.
So far we've found an almost consistent instability in the material.
One batch of nutrient varies sharply from the next.
What do you want to try it on this time?
One of the baby rats?
Okay.
How long before we know anything, Professor?
Well, there have been times when the instability has caused death.
I meant, if it works.
Let me show you.
- You see that rabbit?
- Yes.
How old would you say he was?
Four months.
Look at the chart.
Six days!
Is it normal?
I ran a reflex test on him after you went to bed last night.
The only difference between him and the others... is that he's healthier and stronger.
All the same, we mustn't be in too much of a hurry.
We've got to lick this problem of instability.
Once we can control that, we're ready for the ultimate test: On humans.
There mustn't be a mistake this time.
- I'll be back in a couple of hours.
- All right, Steve.
Science is science, but a girl must get her hair done.
You'd better hurry though, if you're going to catch that bus.
- It only stops on signal, you know.
- I know.
- Anything I can get for you?
- No, thanks.
We'll run those tissue tests when you come back.
- Right.
- Have fun.
Have the prescription refilled and be sure she takes it after every meal.
Okay, Doc, but you know women.
Mary will just let it sit on the shelf.
Yeah, but she'll feel better knowing it's there, won't she?
Yeah, I suppose so.
Say, when are you and me flying out for some more fishing?
- It's been four or five weeks since...
- Excuse me, Jim.
Steve!
- Carry your books, miss?
- Thanks!
I haven't been walked to school in a long time.
Hey, you dress up our town very nicely.
If you don't look out, the
Chamber of Commerce... is going to list you in their publicity with the local attractions.
Say, do you have to go right back?
No.
- Good, let's skip school.
- All right.
It's like an oasis.
- I bring all my patients here.
- I'll bet.
- How's this?
- Fine.
Not now, thanks.
How are you getting along with Deemer?
Half the time he doesn't know I'm there... and the other half he's worried I'll make a mistake.
- He's quite a guy, I guess.
- Yes.
Has he said anything more about that assistant that left?
No.
How's the nutrient coming along?
Well, this is the most amazing thing
I've ever seen.
How long does it take an ordinary rabbit to reach full growth?
I don't know. Four or five months, I guess.
He has one there that's reached maturity in six days.
Six days?
I know it sounds unbelievable, but it's true.
It's still so new and unpredictable.
There are all sorts of things to take into account... before we can even think of experimenting on humans.
Some of the nutrient, when unstable, has even been deadly.
But we do know that it's kept animals alive that have been fed nothing else.
If I stay here much longer
I'm going to miss my bus.
Who can ask for a better opening?
I'm at your service, miss.
Are you sure your patients can spare you?
I'm such a good doctor, they never get sick.
- Come on. Let's go.
- All right.
No wonder you love the desert.
It's so beautiful.
Everything that ever walked or crawled on the face of the earth... swum the depths of the ocean... soared through the sky has left its imprint here.
Look.
Did you ever wonder what piled them up like that?
Wind? Water? What?
I've never seen anything quite like it. Can we stop?
Sure.
All this was once an ocean, wasn't it?
You can still find seashells if you keep your eyes open.
- What's that?
- I...
- There he is.
- It scared me.
I'm beginning to see now why you love it here.
Catching, huh?
I think I'll have that cigarette now.
Thank you.
You know, it must look out of this world from the air.
- I'll show it to you sometime.
- Will you really?
What does it look like?
Like something from another life.
Serene, quiet, yet strangely evil... as if it were hiding its secret from man.
You make it sound so creepy.
The unknown always is.
- Whatever could have started it?
- I don't know.
Well, I think I've had enough of the unknown for one afternoon.
Something must have started it.
You can't second-guess the desert.
Rocks that have stayed for
1,000 years, they just move.
There's no figuring it.
Well, the bus would have gotten me here sooner, but I certainly enjoyed it.
- Give my best to the rabbits.
- Would you like to see them?
Now you're talking.
You can put them right there.
It's funny he's not here.
Maybe he's resting.
- Do I get the guided tour?
- Follow me.
It wasn't like that when I left!
Are you sure it's the same one?
Yes.
We injected a baby rat this morning. Let's take a look at it.
- This morning?
- It was a baby.
Matt, I tell you, this morning it was a baby.
And it doubled in size in a few hours?
Matt, you do believe me?
Of course I do.
Hello?
Yes, he's here. Just a minute.
It's your office.
Thanks. Hello?
Yeah, Josh.
I'll stop by on my way home. Thanks. Bye.
I've got to go.
That's one of the penalties of being a doctor.
I never seem to find time to finish a conversation.
What do you make of that baby rat?
I don't know.
Freaks of any kind give me the willies.
Well, I've heard of giantism, but
I've never seen it produced.
Why don't you have Deemer ask me out in the next day or so.
- I'd like to discuss it with him.
- I will.
Besides, it'll give me a chance to see you again.
Or don't I need an excuse?
- Now, what do you think?
- I'll call you.
My laboratory is not open to the public, Miss Clayton.
Explain why you brought
Dr. Hastings here.
- Sir?
- Dr. Hastings.
Will you please explain why you brought him here?
He's very interested in your work, sir, and I thought it'd be all...
Were you in the habit of conducting tours at Owens University?
No, sir, but I thought it would...
Bringing him here was a breach of my trust in you.
Experimental research is always confidential be it here or anywhere else.
You didn't tell me it was confidential.
I didn't think I'd need to.
Professor, your face.
- That will be enough, Miss Clayton.
- Yes, sir.
- Boy, you got nerves. Simmer down.
- Where did you come from?
I was on my way to old Andy
Andersen's when I saw your car.
What are you doing here?
There was a landslide an hour or so ago.
- Came back to see what caused it.
- This is one of those days.
Old Andy called me in a sweat and said to come a running.
Couldn't figure out what he was yakking about... but it seems like something was eating his cattle.
- Eating them?
- Say...
He had sunstroke a couple of years back. You don't suppose...
No, there must be something to it.
Said he had a stack of bones to show me.
You wouldn't like to come along, would you?
You still trust my judgement after the Jacobs business?
I ain't looking for medical advice, Doc. Just company.
Glad you finally got here, Sheriff.
Hi, Doc. Didn't expect to see you.
Hi, Andy. Jack met me on the way.
Told me you've been having trouble.
- Yeah, darndest thing ever happened.
- Where's what we came for?
Let's go.
I never saw anything like it.
No footprints, no blood, no sign of struggle.
The bones just stripped clean, like peeling a banana.
About noon the boy here came up from the lower section and found them.
I don't suppose it could've been mountain lions?
I've ranched here 22 years now, Doc... and I've had more than my share of lions and wolves.
It wasn't them.
- Where did that come from?
- It was there when the boy got here.
Stop worrying about that and tell me what's picking my cattle clean.
That's all I want to know.
What's doing it?
- Take it easy, Andy.
- They're not your cattle.
If it could happen last night, it could happen tonight, tomorrow night.
It could wipe me out.
Aren't you going to do anything?
I'm up a tree, Andy, like you are.
I don't know where to start thinking.
You got any ideas, Doc?
Better round up what livestock you can and stand guard.
If you see or hear anything, ring me at the house.
I'll be there, just in case.
See you, Andy.
Hi, Jack.
Anyone pull through?
You kidding? I want to show you something.
Morning, Doc.
The Sheriff tells me you've seen something like this before.
Yeah.
You buying this accident business, Doc?
- Aren't you?
- Nope.
I can't figure it.
There isn't a skid mark.
We ploughed through the wreck and found the brakes still work.
It's just like something grabbed the pickup and threw it 30 feet off the road.
Take a look at this, Doc.
I can't understand why I didn't spot this stuff... when I hauled those skeletons out of here and stacked them on the other side.
- They were here?
- Yes, sir. Why?
There doesn't seem to be any distinctive odour.
Wow.
Say, have you got a thermos or a jar around here somewhere?
I think there's one over here.
- Same stuff we found at Andy's?
- Yeah, I think so.
Well, that makes three then.
Three?
Here, the stuff you saw yesterday, and Andy's.
Andy?
His wife found him at the corral last night, dead.
He'd been... Like the cattle and sheep.
There was a couple of gallons of this liquid beside him.
I wish you'd give me a hand with this yarn, Doc.
Stuff here I can't handle.
Maybe there's stuff here none of us can.
If I were you, Joe, I'd write this as a straight accident.
If you print anything as vague as what we've got... you'll scare half the state to death.
- News is news, Doc.
- Guess and a half-truth aren't news.
Why don't you hold off till we nail this down tight?
Maybe then you'll have the biggest story of your life.
- What have you got, Matt?
- I don't know.
But we've got to keep our minds open and our mouths shut till we do know.
Here you are, Doc.
Thanks.
Well?
I'm not sure.
It's impossible at this stage to give you a positive answer.
But it's related to insect venom.
- Insect venom?
- Come off it, Matt.
I know. But it checks.
Acidic content, the whole works.
I'm not sure what kind of insect venom it is, but...
Look, Matt, I'm willing to play ball with you... but there's a limit to what I'll swallow.
Check it yourself, Joe.
I'll show you how.
You're having nightmares, Doc.
There's not an insect in the world with that much venom.
All right, don't take my word for it.
Get someone else to analyse it.
- Who?
- Prof. Deemer.
Hey, that's a good idea.
I'll make a date with him.
Take the stuff out. Okay?
Okay.
- This time don't you forget to let me know.
- I won't, Joe.
Insect venom in the large economy size. I've heard everything.
Give me Prof. Deemer will you, Josh?
Hello?
Hello, Matt.
No, I can talk. He's upstairs.
I was hoping you'd call. There's...
Matt, I've got to talk to you.
Well, he's sick,
Matt, terribly sick.
It's his face and his hands.
Yes. Well, I did.
I asked him to see a doctor, but he won't do any...
Steve? Steve!
She hung up, Doc. You want me to try to get her back?
Hurry, Matt!
- Are you all right?
- Something's happened.
He can hardly breathe!
Steve, get me some water, will you?
Don't you think we ought to get him to a hospital?
There isn't anything they can do for him we can't do right here.
Give him some water, Steve.
There's nothing you can do, Doctor.
- Don't say that.
- Nothing anyone can do.
Start with Jacobs, Professor.
He was the beginning.
Eric and I spent every waking hour on this ever since our... days at Oakridge.
But he was an impatient old man.
He was convinced that... an occasional failure with the animals... didn't necessarily mean... that the nutrient would fail with humans.
Then... one day when I was in town... he and Paul... injected themselves.
When did Jacobs inject himself, sir?
Four days before he died.
Acromegalia developed in four days.
The isotope triggered our nutrient into a nightmare.
Then...
Paul went crazy and attacked me.
While I was unconscious, he made sure that I wouldn't survive.
But I... continued the experiment... hoping that in the short time... left to me, I'd be able... to prove the... nutrient... would work.
You should have seen them.
You should have seen them.
You should have seen them before the fire.
They lived on nothing but our nutrient.
A rat eight times normal size.
A guinea pig big as a police dog.
A tarantula...
Lost, all lost.
What about the tarantula?
Burnt.
All burnt.
Let's take him upstairs.
- He'll sleep for a while.
- Is there any hope?
Here's something to relieve the pain.
Give him one when he wakes up.
Where are you going?
Well, the tarantula...
There's something I want to check on.
I'll phone you when I get back.
- Just set it up, Jean. Then you may go.
- Yes, sir.
Well, that was a pretty accurate analysis you made, Doctor.
Then it is insect venom?
Well, not precisely. It's from a species called arachnida.
- A spider?
- Well, a tarantula, to be exact.
But I've never seen venom in such quantity before.
You know, there's more venom in this test-tube... than you'll find in 100 tarantulas.
You mean a tarantula that could secrete that much venom, would be...
100 times larger than normal?
At least that.
What would you say, Doctor, if I told you I found pools of that venom?
Four and five feet across, two to three inches deep?
I'd say you'd been having a nightmare.
Or that you're the biggest liar since Baron Munchausen.
It's a nightmare all right, Doctor... but not the kind you mean, and I'm not lying to you.
- The tarantula film is ready, Professor.
- Thank you, Jean.
Now look, I know you didn't fly
200 miles just for a joke... but I simply can't believe all you're telling me.
- Good night, Professor.
- Good night, Jean.
Well, under the circumstances we might find this interesting.
That's the largest of tarantulas, from South America... and it's only a foot in diameter with its legs outstretched.
I know. Our Arizona species is even smaller.
That's right. Not more than three inches in size.
Now there it is, coming out of its burrow.
It's got eight legs and can move faster than you think... which assures him of a long life.
As long as 25 years sometimes.
That's the spider wasp... the tarantula's deadliest enemy.
See? The wasp usually wins... but don't count on it, because the tarantula doesn't know the meaning of fear.
As you can see, he'll back down a rattlesnake if he has to.
See?
They're flesh eaters, aren't they?
Yes, and desert beetles are their usual diet.
Those powerful jaws are strong enough to pierce a man's finger.
There. The venom is paralysing the victim.
Tarantulas predigest their food by flooding the wound with a powerful solvent... so that the flesh can be sucked into the body.
That would account for the bones.
Dr. Hastings, your imagination is showing.
So that's it, Doctor.
- How deadly is the venom?
- Not deadly at all.
About as poisonous as a hornet's.
No fun, mind you, but harmless.
The few deaths that have been reported are the result... of germs entering the wound at the time of the bite.
- You make them sound like pets.
- Not pets, Doctor.
Just part of the world about us.
We must accept them as we do the rest of God's creatures.
Each has a function in its own world.
But what if circumstances magnified one of them in size and strength?
Took it out of its primitive world and turned it loose in ours?
Then expect something that's fiercer... more cruel and deadly than anything that ever walked the earth.
How about Dr. Hastings' call to Desert Rock?
I'm afraid I won't be able to get it for you.
The lines are down between
Calamite and Desert Rock.
Be about an hour before they can resume service.
- How'd that happen?
- I really don't know, sir.
Do you want me to try again in about an hour?
No. Never mind. Thanks.
Here you are, Jeb.
Going to be a murky night.
Yeah.
Do you think that was lightning we saw over to the west?
If it was, it's the first time I ever seen lightning throw off sparks.
Maybe one of them college boys short-circuited his nice new Geiger counter.
What was that?
- I'm at the airport.
- Oh.
- Can you hear me now?
- Yeah, yeah.
Jack, we haven't much time.
I want you to round up every available man. Arm them...
Do what? What are you talking about?
Jack, do as I say.
Notify the State Police to meet you at the Deemer place.
Notify the State Police?
You must be drunk.
No. I haven't been drinking.
- All I want you to do is...
- I know. Just call the State Police.
Please, Jack. Believe me.
All right, I'll do it.
Thanks. I'll see you.
He's coming, Matt, I can see it!
There's Matt's car.
- What's it all about?
- Jack, turn the cars around!
- What for?
- There isn't time. I'll tell you later!
Lieutenant, look!
Jumping Jupiter!
Get those submachine guns!
You boys, get back in the car.
They won't stop it!
Matt, if it follows the highway, it'll come right into Desert Rock.
- Doc, keys in your car?
- Yeah.
Doc and Miss Clayton are coming with us.
Get in. You boys, try to slow it down.
- If you can't, take Doc's car and follow us.
- Yes, sir.
- Come on. Start it, man!
- I can't start it.
Come on, you'll flood it.
That is correct.
You've got at the outside 30 minutes to get everybody out. Over.
Desert Rock will be cleared in 30 minutes. Over.
Do you think dynamite would stop him?
Get a truck over to Murphy's, load up all the dynamite he has.
Bring it just north of Devil's Rock.
We'll be waiting for it.
Yeah, dynamite might work.
But what if it doesn't?
You got any other suggestions,
Doc? It'll be light soon.
If we could get a message to the air base at Sands.
How are you going to do that?
- Somebody could phone from town.
- Unless the lines are down.
Sergeant, I want you to phone the commanding officer at Sands Air Base.
Any special instructions, Doc?
Yeah. If the boys have some napalm, tell them to bring it along.
Sergeant, tell them to load up with napalm, rockets, anything they've got.
Hurry it up, boys!
- That's the last of it, Mr. Murphy.
- That's it, Joe.
There isn't another stick of dynamite in the whole town.
Here. Prime them on the way.
- See you later, I hope.
- You will.
All right. Let her roll!
Don't forget to prime them!
Pull her right in here, boys!
Pull her in here.
Right across the road. Come on!
Lend a hand, boys!
Watch it now! They're all primed!
Where do you want this dynamite?
- Across the road.
- Shake it up, boys! Lend a hand!
Watch it now! Put the boxes right down there across the road.
All right, let's go.
Come on, boys. Get them down here!
- All right. Here we go.
- Come on, get that dynamite down here.
All right. Beautiful.
- Do you think it will work?
- Dynamite's tricky stuff.
It may blow it up. It may just blow the highway up.
Doggone, I wish we had some nitro.
I'll have to see that tarantula before I believe it.
You'll see it, Joe, and you'll wish you hadn't.
Let's go! Get those wires hooked up.
Here he comes!
Holy cow!
Come on! Get back!
- Let's go!
- Come on.
Get this truck turned around!
Let's go!
Hold it!
We've gotta hurry it up.
Hurry it up.
I got it.
Steady.
Now!
Let's get out of here.
What now?
- I don't know.
- We got to do something.
Biggest story of my life and I won't get a chance to write it.
Look!
Look, here they come!
Look at them!
All right, Betts. Fire two rockets on this first pass.
Here goes.
Dropping napalm. Follow in order.
Dump them all.
How was the take tonight?
Not bad, Mr. Hennessy.
- Almost 20 grand.
- Good.
Tell the boys I'll be with them in a few minutes.
Mary, for deposit tomorrow.
142 one hundred-dollar bills,
100 fifty-dollar bills, the rest five, 10...
I told you I'd come back.
Remember Buchanan?
Why, you're not Buchanan!
I don't look like him but I am him.
Don't you recognize the voice, Jim?
I promised to see you die and I will.
- Hey, boss, what's the matter?
- Hey, boss, let us in.
- Hey, boss, what's the matter?
- Hey, boss, let us in.
Hey, boss.
Come back home. Come back home.
Get in the automobile.
Get in the automobile.
The automobile.
Get inside!
Turn on the ignition.
Now, drive home.
He got hit when they shot at him.
He might not be able to make it.
If his brain is still receptive, he can be directed.
Well, what if it isn't? What if their bullets hit one of the brain electrodes?
As long as he has an ounce of liquid in his veins, he will return home.
I've told you, these creatures automatically try to return to their source of feeding when their energies run low.
Well, your creature's helped us get rid of the first one.
I'll see them all die before I'm through.
Oh, if I had only known when you first offered to help me financially.
Dr. Steigg, if it weren't for my money, you'd still be experimenting with cats and dogs in that flea-sized lab of yours in Europe.
I made it possible for you to prove your theory with human beings.
That is true.
But my theory was to use these creatures to help people live by doing everything that was difficult and dangerous.
You just want to see people die.
Not just people, Steigg. Particular people.
And I'll get them. Every single one of them.
And after you do?
What?
There'll be nothing we can't do or have.
Nobody'll be able to stop us.
Can't you keep him going any longer?
No, I can't keep them breathing longer than a few days, then the glands deteriorate.
They just disintegrate.
Is he dead?
He never was alive.
Different parts of the body die at different times.
My next problem is how to keep them working as long as the heart is beating.
Does the brain still die first?
Always.
The brain always dies first.
- Why aren't you boys home in bed?
- Hello, Dr. Walker.
I gave him exactly $19,821.
All right, wait outside, will you, please?
- Oh, hello, Chet.
- D.A.
- Hi.
- Hi, Dave.
- What does it look like?
- Your guess is as good as mine.
- Robbery behind it?
- Yeah, it could be.
Yet whoever did it left over 60 grand in the safe.
Maybe he didn't want to get into a higher bracket.
Oh, brother.
How did he get it?
How didn't he get it?
The neck's been broken and also his spine.
Just by twisting it.
The murderer must have had the strength of an ape.
Hennessy's guards saw him.
Said he looked like any other man.
Don't tell me he bent these bars?
That's what Hennessy's boys say.
The killer came in and got out that way.
Well, I'd hate to meet him on a dark night.
- Bullet holes, huh?
- Hennessy's boys shot at him.
Hit him, too. Look at the trail of blood.
We found some blood on the road.
You know, there's something screwy about this whole thing.
He must've been hit bad to lose that much blood, yet he made it to his car and got away.
Well, whoever it was, was certainly careless. These fingerprints are perfect.
- That's strange.
- What is?
Turn out the lights for a minute, will you?
- See it?
- Yeah.
The fingerprints are luminous.
Yes, and the footprints and the blood.
Turn on the lights again, huh?
What do you make of that?
I'm a district attorney, not a chemist.
Ask Chet.
- What about it, Chet?
- I wish I knew.
Let's take this back to the lab and make a test on it.
I'll send the fingerprints to Washington.
Maybe they can trace them there.
- Don't let anyone in there.
- Have you any idea who did it?
- Was it robbery?
- What's the inside on this?
Got nothing to say now, boys.
Doctor, how did anybody break through those bars in there?
Maybe he ate all his vitamins.
Vitamins?
Look, a diluted solution of hematin.
Two absorption bands between the Fraunhofer lines.
Oh, cut the double-talk, Chet, and break it down to plain English.
Take a look. This so-called blood is a chemical composition.
It looks like a bunch of crystals to me.
Exactly. There are crystals in that concoction.
Now, what do you mean "concoction"?
Here. I'll show you.
Adrenaline, sodium hydroxide and blood sugars.
Throws the beam to the right dextrose.
No hemoglobin traceable.
No hemoglobin? Then it isn't blood.
Right. Like I said before, it's a chemical composition.
Here, I'll put it in the centrifuge and we'll see what else it's made of.
Well, why is that stuff luminous?
That's right, why is it luminous, Chet?
Just as I thought.
This so-called blood is highly radioactive.
- Dangerously so?
- Plus nine.
Is that a lot?
Enough to kill a man if he's exposed to it long enough.
Well, that's about all we can do for tonight.
Let me know when you hear from
Washington on those fingerprints.
Well, what'd you find out?
Yeah, how about giving us a lowdown on this?
Yeah, give us a lead, will you?
- You want the truth?
- Yeah.
All right, then, according to the evidence,
Hennessy was murdered by a creature with atom rays of superhuman strength.
And a creature that cannot be killed by bullets.
Creature?
You don't expect us to believe that?
- No.
- Big joke.
Just for that I'll misspell your name.
I don't blame them.
I don't believe it myself and I was with you.
Dave. Come on in.
- Where's Chet?
- Sleeping.
Sleeping? At this hour?
Yes, at this hour. 7:30.
Well, don't blame me, Joyce.
I didn't ask him to be a cop.
Get him up, will you? it's important.
- Where's Penny?
- Having breakfast.
Uncle Dave.
Well, how's my little sweetheart this morning, huh?
I feel fine, Uncle Dave.
There's some coffee in there, Dave.
Thanks, I can use it.
Well, Penny and me are going to have a little tête-à-tête, aren't we, huh?
I never tasted a tête-à-tête before.
Chet.
Chet.
Chet, wake up.
Chet, not now!
- Name a better time.
- Dave's here.
Oh, he can wait till I kiss my wife.
Chet, he'll hear us.
So what? We're married.
But he's not.
Well, then let him find out what he's missing.
Chet, he says it's important.
Important?
About that murder last night?
Yeah, must be.
You didn't tell me anything about it.
I don't believe in talking shop when I'm home.
You'll probably read all about it anyway.
And when you do, you won't believe it.
I'll tell him you'll be right out.
Oh, this door sticks.
Remember, Mrs. Walker, you had your chance.
Come on, open up.
Tell me a story first.
It's too early in the morning for stories.
I always tell a story to my dolly.
- Do you like her?
- Oh, I'm crazy about her.
- What's her name?
- Henrietta.
Henrietta?
I used to go with a girl named Henrietta.
What happened to her?
What happened to her shouldn't happen to your doll.
She married a con man.
That's not the kind of a story to tell kids.
- Hi, Penny.
- Hello, Daddy.
Hurry up, Penny. You'll be late for school.
Come on.
Atta girl. Goodbye now.
Goodbye, Daddy.
- Goodbye, Uncle Dave.
- Have fun, Penny.
That's the story of a cop's life.
"Hello, Daddy. Goodbye, Daddy."
What's up?
You'd better sit down first.
I just came from the Bureau.
They checked the murderer's fingerprints.
His name is Willard Pearce.
They let me have it from the files.
Petty theft, fraud, three months in prison, tubercular...
How could a tubercular man have strength enough to break those bars like that?
You think that's something?
Answer this one.
How could a dead man have strength enough to do it?
Deceased?
Yeah, and I used to think
Scrabble was tough.
When did he die?
Well, according to that, 24 days ago.
Oh, that doesn't make sense.
You're the smart one.
If it doesn't make sense to you, imagine how it sounds to me.
Have they got a file on this guy?
Yes, I copied it.
"Died of asphyxiation on the 22nd of last month.
"Body delivered to the city morgue.
"Copy of coroner's report was attached."
Have you checked with the morgue?
I got two of the boys doing it now.
Does MacGraw know?
I called him at his home.
He told us to meet him at his office.
Hello.
Oh, yes, he's here.
For you, Dave.
Yes? Be right over.
Remember that cylinder we took out of Hennessy's Dictaphone?
- Yeah.
- Like to hear it?
- Sure.
- Come on.
Bye, Penny.
- Now perhaps we can all relax for a little...
- Bye, honey.
- Call you later.
- Chet, you didn't have breakfast.
- Nope.
- Chet, it's not healthy to...
Goodbye, Joyce.
What are you doing in here?
I'm from Buchanan.
If you know that, you know why I'm here.
It's no use, MacGraw.
I said I would live to see you die.
I am watching you now.
Come back home. Come home.
Come back home.
Mary, for deposit tomorrow.
142 one hundred-dollar bills,
100 fifty-dollar bills, the rest five, 10...
I told you I'd come back.
That's when the Dictaphone was knocked out of his hand or he dropped it.
Anyone recognize that voice?
I do and I don't.
I just got a feeling that
I've heard it before.
Well, it'd be hard to place it anyway, but the killer's voice sounded more mechanical than Hennessy's.
- Did you notice it?
- Yes, it's like a...
Like a recording of a recording.
"I told you I'd come back."
Not much to tie onto there.
Well, could've been some big loser who swore to get even or some gambler he rousted around.
Anyone and anything.
Anyway, there's no doubt that he bent the bars and came in through the window.
We could hear the sound of the glass crashing.
Listen, MacGraw must be waiting for us now.
Yeah.
Oh, but if that's the D.A., tell him we're on the way up.
Hello. Yeah.
MacGraw?
MacGraw was found in his garage, murdered.
I'll meet you down there.
I want to pick up some equipment first.
Okay.
Looks like the same job pulled on Hennessy.
- Did you find any prints?
- Plenty.
I asked the Bureau to call me here as soon as they get a line on them.
- How long has he been dead?
- About an hour.
It must have happened just as he was getting ready to go to the office.
Who found him?
His wife. She's in the house now.
I had to give her a sedative.
Take him away, boys.
Captain Harris, I can't figure this one.
His jaw's broken. Neck, too.
It wasn't a weapon.
The bruises look to me as though they'd been done by a fist.
But MacGraw was a husky guy.
I've never seen a case where a man's neck was broken by the sheer force of a grip.
Why should anyone want to kill MacGraw?
Well, he was a district attorney.
A lot of guys must have hated his guts.
MacGraw's enemies were usually friends of Hennessy's, and yet they were both killed in the same way and by the same person or thing.
Thing?
How about a statement, Captain Harris?
About time we had something official.
As soon as we have something to say, we'll say it.
Do you tie up MacGraw's murder with the Hennessy murder?
Not until we know more about it.
You're wanted on the phone, Captain.
It's in the house.
Geiger counter?
I want to check the car for radioactive emanations.
Emanations?
Say, Dr. Walker, didn't you find radioactivity in the Hennessy killing?
Well, then that would connect the two murders, wouldn't it?
Well, yes and no.
It's not a conclusive fact.
Just an approach.
That story you gave us last night about a creature charged with atom rays,
-it's on the level then, huh?
- I told you it was.
Hey, we had a scoop and didn't know it.
Let's get out of here.
It was the Bureau.
The prints belong to a Vernon Dunn.
He died a few weeks ago.
And that's not all. Get this.
The boys just checked the morgue.
Eight bodies have disappeared.
Call the inspector and tell him I want to talk to him as soon as possible.
And ask him to have the Mayor there and the commanding general of this military area.
General?
We're going to need all the cooperation we can get on this one.
How do you do, ladies and gentlemen?
This is Dick Cutting with today's commentary on the news.
Well, as you know, today's big story hinges around the killing of District Attorney MacGraw, whose body was found today in his garage, murdered in much the same manner as Hennessy was.
What connection the murder of MacGraw can possibly have with Hennessy, a gangland boss, is unknown at present.
Dr. Chet Walker of the police laboratory has given out a fantastic story, so incredible that one can lend it little credence.
Dr. Walker is of the opinion those crimes are being perpetrated by dead men.
Yes, I said dead men, restored to life in some unknown manner by being charged with atom rays, which give them superhuman strength and makes them impervious to bullets.
Well, if you want to believe that story, you can...
This Walker must be a pretty smart cookie.
He has imagination.
The kind of imagination that may prove dangerous to us.
You mean the kind of imagination that could prove dangerous to him.
About time to feed them, isn't it?
Hello, Walker. Captain. Mayor Bremer.
General Saunders.
This is Captain Harris and Dr. Walker.
Walker's in charge of our lab.
I hope, Dr. Walker, you've called us here to assure us the stories about dead men walking our streets is only a hoax.
I wish they were.
What did you find out about those bodies stolen from the morgue?
Well, according to the records, they were to be cremated.
They were placed in coffins and delivered to the city crematory.
May I ask how this concerns me?
You can be of great help to us, General, as I'll explain in a moment.
But first, I'd like to give you and the
Mayor a picture of what's been taking place so that you can understand exactly what we're up against.
Couldn't those bodies have been stolen by some of those creatures on or before arrival?
Well, they could've. But that wouldn't explain them coming back to life.
What makes you so sure they were alive?
What makes me so... Well, they were walking around, weren't they?
It says you found fingerprints.
You yourself said those dead people committed the crimes!
Yes, those are the facts.
But I'm afraid we'll have to depart from our usual approach to get anywhere on this case.
I wish, Dr. Walker, you'd make yourself a little clearer.
Well, let me give you a very primitive example.
Do you remember Faraday's experiment with a frog's leg?
I flunked Chemistry One three times.
I remember Faraday's experiment.
Good. Then you'll remember that Faraday applied energy, in that case electricity, to the leg which had been severed from its body.
It moved.
Frog legs. I don't see the parallel.
People of that day wouldn't believe that the leg of a dead animal could move, but Faraday proved it.
We know why.
Yes, now we know why and take our knowledge for granted.
In our case, which is as mysterious to us as Faraday's was in his time, we found traces of energy.
Energy which would increase the strength of any animal tremendously.
Radioactivity.
Well, you've lost me.
All right, Chet. What you're trying to do now is throw away everything we've learned so far about life and death and start from scratch.
And just how do you propose to do this?
Well, we have certain clues.
One very definite one.
In both of the murders, radioactive emanations were found.
Now that's where you come in, General.
We'll have to find the source of these emanations.
Now I want to use Air Force planes and trucks equipped with instruments which can track down that source.
I'll see that you get the trucks and I'll call Colonel Roberts at Monroe Air Force Base about the planes.
He'll give you all the cooperation you need.
We'd certainly appreciate that.
Tell him I'll be down to talk to him at, say, 3:00.
Goodbye, Dr. Walker. Good day, gentlemen.
Of all things to happen under my administration.
Keep me posted on this.
And suppose we do find the source?
Then we'll be able to find the cause.
That car in front. Get it. Wreck it.
Drive into it.
What's he doing at the airfield?
Better wait and find out.
It may concern us.
Come back!
Stop.
It's you!
Well, who did you think it was?
Don't tell me strangers are in the habit of...
I was wondering if you'd be home in time for dinner.
That's not true, Chet.
Is it?
Better hide it from Penny.
- But how can I hide a thing like...
- Please, Joyce.
I'm tired and I'm hungry and I'm...
Frankly, I don't know how.
I don't know any more about it than it says right there.
Look, how are we fixed for a nice, cold martini?
Coming right up, Chet.
Penny's outside playing.
Well, what about it?
Well, is it safe?
There seems to be some sort of a definite pattern.
Can't put my finger on it, but I do know that Hennessy and MacGraw were killed for a reason.
Well, it's all right then?
Well, for a while.
I don't think they've gotten around to indiscriminate killings yet.
Yet?
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, Penny.
Where's the paper, Mommy?
I want to read the funnies.
Oh, it didn't come today, dear.
Oh, then I'll put on the TV.
- No, Penny.
- It's broken, Penny.
We'll have to have a man over to fix it.
Yeah.
Look, why don't you play with Henrietta?
She's a bad girl and I'm punishing her.
Well, did you spank her?
I put her in her bed and told her she can't look at TV all week.
You're a tough one, you are.
Thanks, honey.
I've been looking forward to this all day.
I'll go.
Hello, Uncle Dave.
Hi, Penny. How are you?
Oh, it's you.
Oh, you don't seem particularly happy to see me.
There comes a time in every woman's life when she'd like to be alone with her husband, if only for a few minutes.
How come you never got married,
Uncle Dave?
He'd be a bigamist, Penny.
He's already married to your father.
- Want a drink, Dave?
- No, not while I'm on duty.
Well, I'm not on duty.
You will be when you hear what I've got to tell you.
Penny, will you please go to your room?
Why? I didn't do anything.
I know, dear. it's just that Daddy and Uncle Dave want to be alone.
I won't bother them.
Go to your room this minute, Penny.
All right. But I always let you listen when I talk to Henrietta.
Okay, let's have it.
Look, I'm not a child.
And this is my house.
You're not going to put me out of it.
The only time my wife talks is when I'm ready to go to sleep.
All right. I'll get dinner.
Remember you said this morning that you were thrown because Hennessy and MacGraw were both killed in the same way and by the same thing yet they were always on opposite sides of the fence?
- Yeah, what about it?
- Well, that worried me, too.
So I checked back on both of them and found that they were on the same side of the fence, once.
- Well, when was that?
- About 10 years ago when you first came into the police lab.
Hennessy and MacGraw helped convict Frank Buchanan.
Buchanan.
The name rings a bell, but not too clearly.
Buchanan was a top mobster around these parts.
He practically ran the city.
When MacGraw became D.A. he took out after him.
Well, where does Hennessy come in?
Well, Hennessy was Buchanan's number-two man.
He wanted the number-one slot, so he turned on him.
Oh, yeah.
I remember something about it now.
Wasn't Buchanan shipped off to Europe?
That's right.
He got five years and deportation.
I don't get the connection.
Listen to this.
I got it out of the newspaper files.
"No sooner was sentence pronounced
"than Buchanan leaped to his feet, screaming to MacGraw,
"'I'll get you for this.
You and everyone who squealed on me.
"'I'll come back and see you die, every single one of you!"' Get it?
That voice on the Dictaphone.
"I told you I'd come back."
That's right.
That's the first thing I thought of, too.
- Yeah.
- But you just said he was deported.
I'm not saying it's him, but it's a lead.
It's the only connecting link
I could come up with, why any guy should want to kill both
MacGraw and Hennessy.
Did you check with the authorities over there?
Well, I cabled them and just got this answer.
"Frank Buchanan, resided in Rome.
Via Lucullo, Number 11.
"House vacated.
Left no forwarding address."
Well, he could still be anywhere in Europe.
Well, I cabled the chief of police in Rome.
Asked him to investigate further and cable me as soon as he had a line on him.
Were there any others who helped convict Buchanan?
Two others who were in with him and the fellow who was the Assistant
District Attorney, Lester Banning.
He's now in private practice.
Think they should be warned?
I'm having the boys round them up now.
They should be in my office any minute.
Well, let's go.
What about dinner?
Oh, keep it warm, honey.
I'll be back in an hour or two.
- Sorry, Joyce.
- I'll bet you are.
One for the road?
Oh, not now, dear. I'm back on duty.
- Oh, nice to see you, Mr. Banning.
- Thank you, Captain.
This is Dr. Walker, head of our crime lab.
- Doctor.
- Banning.
And this is Jason Franchot.
He used to be Buchanan's accountant.
And Dunn here used to be his gunsel.
- I don't like that word.
- Paid killer. Like it better?
Look, I've been traveling straight and I don't know what
I was brought here for, but it's a bum rap.
I want to see a lawyer.
Now tell me, Captain, what's this all about?
I called you here to warn you that your lives may be in danger.
Is Buchanan back?
What makes you say that?
First Hennessy then MacGraw.
He said he'd get us.
But I didn't know he was back in the country.
His sentence wasn't changed.
How could he be back?
If he's in this country, he's here illegally.
Now if you take my advice, you'll all go to jail for protection and stay there until we can find out whether it's Buchanan or not who's behind all this.
Not me. I worked too hard to get out of jail.
- It's for your own good.
- Think my wife would believe that?
She'd think I went back to packing a rod.
What about you?
I have a good business now.
Tax auditor, public accountant.
If I went to jail, my reputation would be ruined.
I don't think it's necessary, Captain.
Particularly since there's no proof that Buchanan is back in this country.
All right. But I am going to give you protection 24 hours a day no matter where you are. Got that, Tom?
- Right.
- Have some of the boys drive them home.
Now if an attempt is made to get any one of them next then we'll know for sure.
It'll complete the pattern.
It's the hard way to find out.
This is from the chief of police in Rome.
"Attention, Captain David Harris."
"...in lab operation, who also has disappeared.
"If find any additional information, will advise.
"Rome Chief of Police."
Dogs, cats, monkeys.
That's the way experimentation usually starts.
Starts?
It's only one step from animals to human beings.
Captain Harris sent me to relieve you.
A little early, but why complain?
And with the murder of Jason Franchot last night I must apologize for my recent skepticism regarding these radioactive creatures.
It seems they do exist and they are prowling the street.
Police Chief Camden assures us that they are doing everything in their power to get to the source of these beings.
With the cooperation of the military, planes and helicopters equipped with radium finders are now overhead, and strange-looking trucks similarly equipped are now at this moment prowling through the streets of our city to track them down.
Excuse me, please.
A glass of beer, please.
Thank you.
Hey, you forgot your change.
This is a sawbuck.
Two bits in the till, $9.75 in my pocket.
Now that's what I call a tip.
You from Water and Power?
Five point two.
What's this all about anyway?
I'm probing for radioactivity.
Is there uranium around here?
I'm going to call my lawyer and find out if I own the mineral rights.
- Who was sitting here?
- Search me.
He went out the back way.
- Do you know who he is?
- Never saw him before.
Hey! Don't wash that glass.
He never washes them anyway.
He leave anything else here?
No.
Just this.
This 10-spot hot?
Hotter than you think.
This is an international who's who of the medical profession.
Here's what it says.
"Wilhelm Steigg, born in Stuttgart, Germany, in 1893.
"University of Berlin, Zurich, Milan.
"1948 Harman Prize for his research in amygdala stimuli."
Amygdala stimuli, what's that?
Ultra-short wave stimulations to specific parts of the brain, producing involuntary movements of the body.
- That's highly specialized stuff.
- Yeah.
A number of stories have been published about amygdala stimulation of monkeys.
Here's one of them.
Appropriations have been made for research and development, and there's a doctor in Madrid who's made great advances since this article was published.
Have you been conducting any experiments here at the hospital?
No. But I have a short film that I told you about.
Would you like me to run it?
- I'd appreciate it.
- Fine.
Draw the curtains, will you?
This animal looks content, doesn't it?
You wouldn't suspect that it has
18 electrodes inserted in its skull.
Turning this switch releases a small amount of ultra-short waves.
Those electrodes are tuned to specific frequencies.
As long as the impulse is released, the dog barks.
By applying another impulse of different frequency, the dog immediately falls asleep.
It will lie there as long as the stimulus is active.
Another impulse will make it vicious.
Docile.
Hunger can be induced.
Or it can be made to resent its food.
Amygdala stimulations, somatomotor and visceromotor effects.
Does this demonstration satisfy your curiosity?
Almost.
Try my special mixture.
Thanks.
This experiment was done on live animals.
Of course.
Do you think it could be applied to dead ones?
Dead ones?
Offhand, I'd say no.
The command impulse is so small, less than a millionth of a watt, that only the animal's body energies could supply the reactions.
If you could replace the body energy from an outside source, say, with radioactive energies, do you think you'd get the same results?
Well, your question is much too abstract to be answered at this moment, Dr. Walker.
Do you think an experiment on humans would have the same result as on animals?
We haven't arrived at that stage of our experiment, yet.
Could it be possible that somebody else has tried and already succeeded?
Are you trying to connect the experiments with animals with mysterious events of our city?
It would answer the riddle, wouldn't it?
Remote-controlled creatures, their brains powered by atomic energy, roaming the streets, directed from a central point.
Utterly fantastic.
Yes? Yes, he's here.
It's for you, Doctor.
Yes? Oh, yes, Dave.
Send the glass and that bill over to the lab at once.
That bird must be radiating in the dark.
I don't understand how he can stay alive with all that radium poisoning in his system.
German accent, huh?
Better have them search every house within a 10-block radius.
Letting them get that close to you.
What did you ever leave here for?
The pain, the pain in my hand was killing me.
If I hadn't gotten some medicine to relieve it, I would have gone crazy.
From now on just hide in here.
With the walls and the shutters leaded, they'll never find us.
I'm not so sure.
Those creatures, they leave radioactive traces.
Sooner or later they will be picked up.
The planes, how low they're flying.
Oh, I think it was a mistake not to get rid of that Walker when we had the chance.
It's a mistake we can remedy easily enough.
I'll stop them.
I'll make them ground every plane and pull out every truck looking for us.
Go in there and fix up that stoolie.
I want to send one of them out.
And you feel certain it's Buchanan who's behind all this?
For my money, it is.
Killing Franchot completed the pattern.
What about those other two,
Banning and whatever his name is?
Who, Dunn? We put them in the county jail.
They'll be safe there.
It's the first time that gunsel ever begged to be put into jail.
He was scared stiff.
He isn't the only one.
- Yes?
- Call for you, sir. Personal.
The party says it's important.
Hello. Yes, this is Chief Camden.
You will stop all planes and trucks searching for radioactivity.
I will give you until 3:00 this afternoon to do this.
If you do not, many people will be killed exactly one hour later.
Who is this? Who is this?
There will be no other warning.
Hello? Hello? Hello?
They hung up before
I could put a tracer on it.
It was a warning to withdraw all our planes and trucks equipped with radium finders by 3:00.
Or else.
What do you mean "or else"?
He, or whatever it was, practically threatened mass murder one hour later.
What did the voice sound like?
Sort of mechanical.
What do you think, Dr. Walker?
Could he, or they, or whatever these creatures are, could they do this thing?
There's no definite knowledge as to what they can or cannot do.
Then they must be stopped.
- How?
- Well...
Our only chance is to find their source.
But if we pull back all the planes and trucks we'll never find the source.
Give into Buchanan now and there's no telling what he'll ask for next.
You think they're bluffing, Chet?
They could be, but I doubt it.
Captain, alert the entire force. Put every available officer on duty at 4:00.
I wonder just what they're trying to do.
We'll find out in two hours.
As Governor, I am declaring a state of emergency.
All police facilities have been alerted to protect us against any further crimes by so-called atomic creatures.
The state militia will assist in patrolling all traffic.
All scheduled transportation shall be canceled until further notice.
If you must go outside, have identification papers with you.
The radium-finding planes and trucks will continue to operate since this is our best hope of locating the source of these beings.
Do not be alarmed as we are confident we will soon pinpoint the origin of these emanations.
All possible measures for your safety are being taken...
I think we'd better dismantle the panel right now and get out of here while we can.
Not till I'm finished.
There are two more yet, to say nothing of that bright boy, Dr. Walker.
But you don't even know where they have hidden Banning and Dunn.
Walker'd know.
- If we got him...
- Why, as a creature, he would have no memory. You know that.
He's a cop, isn't he?
We can use him to get the information for us.
Bring one of them out, right now.
Oh, hey, Dave, will you do me a favor and take my car over to the lab?
Have one of the boys take the Geiger counter out of the trunk.
- It needs a little adjustment.
- All right. You can drive mine home.
- Thanks.
- I'll bring it back in the morning.
Okay.
Hey, what's the big idea?
Identification.
Oh, yes. Of course. I forgot.
Franchot.
Hand me the scalpel.
I think we've made our first real mistake.
- A dangerous mistake.
- I don't think so.
What will you use Captain Harris for?
The same thing I was going to use Walker for.
He's a cop, too, isn't he?
Get him in shape as fast as you can.
- Is he ready?
- Yes.
Let's take a look at him.
Come in.
Closer.
Stop.
Why doesn't he see us?
What's wrong?
Look at us.
See how the selen cells transmit the image the creature sees on this screen?
And with him I have actually succeeded in stimulating the muscular impulse of the larynx so that I can activate him to speak.
- With his own voice?
- Yes.
Let's hear it.
Make him say something to me.
What do you want him to say?
His name. And make him look at me.
Look at him.
Say, "My name is David Harris.
Captain Harris, Homicide Squad."
My name is David Harris.
Captain Harris, Homicide Squad.
Steigg, you may be a crackpot, but you're also a genius.
I think we can finish up all our unfinished business by tomorrow.
I'll go.
Penny! Ask who it is first.
Who is it?
I am Captain Harris, Homicide.
It's Uncle Dave.
Why so formal?
"I am Captain Harris, Homicide."
Hello, Uncle Dave.
Daddy isn't home.
He just left.
I'm baking a cake for Penny.
It's her birthday.
I'm seven today, going on eight.
Excuse me, will you? My cake will be ruined.
Gosh, your hand is cold.
Sit down, Uncle Dave. I want you to see what Mother got for Henrietta.
See? She got a new dress, panties, socks and shoes.
Don't you think they're beautiful?
What's the matter, Uncle Dave?
Cat got your tongue?
Where is your father?
I don't know.
Ask your mother.
Mommy, Uncle Dave wants to know where Daddy is.
He went to see Chief Camden, Dave.
Something about those two men involved with Buchanan.
Those two you're keeping in the county jail.
What are their names again, Dave?
You know who I'm talking about.
- Banning and Dunn.
- That's it.
You sound terrible, Dave.
Are you sure you feel well?
Penny, keep away from him.
He may be coming down with a cold.
Here. Hold Henrietta for me.
It's time to feed her.
Chet had a brainstorm this morning, Dave.
Something about giving out phony information as to where those two men were hidden.
He thinks Buchanan will send out one of those creatures to kill them and then you can capture him.
But he'll tell you all about that when you see him.
Penny, what are you looking for?
Where's Henrietta's bottle?
Here is it.
Now please stay out of the kitchen.
I'm busy enough as it is.
Mommy!
Penny! Penny!
Mommy!
Penny, baby, what's the matter?
- Honey, what's the matter?
- It's my dolly!
I told you I'd make use of him.
They were going to trick you with false information.
We're about to pull a neat little trick ourselves.
Tell him to hurry up.
Faster. Faster.
Dr. Walker's trying to locate you, Captain.
He said to get in touch with him immediately.
This is 13-F-1 calling from frequency two.
Inform Dr. Chet Walker that
Captain Harris is at the county jail.
KMA 3-6-7.
Oh, Captain Harris.
Glad to see you again.
Yeah. We're getting tired of looking at one another.
How long do we have to stay holed up here?
Being with him is like being in solitary.
Well, if we can judge by the progress the police are making, we may as well resign ourselves to spending the rest of our lives together.
That may not be as long as you think.
What's wrong, Captain?
Captain, you off your rocker?
I'm Frank Buchanan.
You're cracked! You ain't Buchanan.
You're Captain Harris.
I am Buchanan.
I told you I'd see you die.
Hi, Dave!
Joyce called me. Why in the world did you...
Hey, Dave. Wait a minute. What's the rush?
We got Walker.
For Pete's sake, Dave. What's eating you?
Slow down, Dave.
Attention all cars.
Lester Banning and Tom Dunn found murdered in county jail.
Police Captain David Harris, suspect.
Proceeding south with Dr. Chet Walker in yellow convertible.
License number 27H4926.
Dave? Did they... Oh, no.
Proceeding south with Dr. Chet Walker in yellow convertible.
License number 27H4926.
Smash up that car. Smash it up.
Did the car crash?
It must have.
Then both are dead.
Only one can die, Mr. Buchanan.
- Dr. Walker, you all right?
- Yeah.
Have Chief Camden rush a helicopter to pick up Captain Harris and take him to the city hospital.
Yes, sir.
And tell him to have Dr. Norton stand by.
Right.
Muscular movement extremely strong.
Extra-ocular reactions missing completely.
Reactions similar to those of animals subjected to strong amygdaloid stimulations.
Got that?
Thank you.
The X-rays of the skull.
These will bring us a few steps closer to the solution.
Will you follow me to my office, please?
Doctor, stay here and let me know should the patient's condition change.
Amazing.
What are the small protrusions on end of the dark lines?
Electrodes.
As you see, they are grouped in patterns.
Every one is connected with an amygdala circuit.
You used that word before.
What does it mean?
The small lobes projecting from the underside of the cerebellum.
All our body movements originate from there.
These nerves stimulate muscular impulses.
That's how the body gets orders from the brain.
Muscular impulses?
The larynx is a muscle, isn't it?
We certainly move it by muscular contraction.
That's why those creatures are able to talk.
If the right stimulation activates the amygdala circuit, they will speak.
There is no question about it.
But they're not aware of what they're saying.
They are not aware of anything.
Those disks in front of the eyes are selen cells.
What makes you think so?
Electric impulses produced by light.
They could very well be transmitted back to...
Well, let me call it a receiving station.
What would that mean?
If the image on the retina could be transmitted then someone would be able to witness whatever this creature is seeing on a screen.
But that's impossible.
- Look here.
- What is it?
You see? A few of the very fine wires have been broken loose.
That's why the creature is impassive.
He's moving. He's trying to get away.
We can't get through to him.
See?
Some of the electrodes must have been broken when he had that accident.
The oscillograph doesn't register the impulse.
His eyes are open.
- Does he see us?
- I don't know.
Don't go closer in case the selen cells can still transmit light images.
Maybe you can lead us to them, Dave.
Maybe you could... it's just a hunch but I think he's trying to return to his source of energy.
Look, see how he turns, as if trying to find a certain direction?
Watch it!
Let him go. I'll follow him in the helicopter that brought us.
Tell your men not to interfere with Captain Harris if he takes a car,
-even a police car.
- Right.
Let's hope he leads us to the source before his energy runs down completely.
Try to contact him.
If he has any energy left at all, he will return to replenish it.
The radium in this tube, wherever he is, this will attract him like a magnet.
Captain Harris leaving hospital area.
Patrol car 557 passed
First Street heading north. Over.
Camden! Come in, Camden!
- This is Camden.
- I can see 557.
Have your men keep out of his way.
He can only see what is in front of him, clear?
- Over.
- Clear.
Over and out.
Take her down.
Fly about 500 yards behind 557.
Patrol car 557 passing Third Street area.
557 turned onto foothill proceeding south.
Caution them to follow and not interfere.
Will advise when 557 reaches destination.
Over.
Place located at end of Westholm
Boulevard. Notify all aid. Over and out.
Okay, set her down.
In a little while, the police and soldiers will be here.
Come with me.
I've had enough bloodshed.
I will not let you commit any more.
Oh, yeah? Try and stop me.
A life of work.
But I'll destroy it first.
I'll bring up some incendiaries, burn the place down.
No! There must be radium in there.
A fire would burn off its protective lead shield.
Yes, once the radium is exposed, the gamma rays might spread over the entire city.
Then we can't even blow open the door or the windows.
It would be too dangerous to try it because of explosion.
Come in.
Come in.
Go out and kill them.
Kill them.
Look.
Good grief. Look at them.
Those are the bodies that were stolen from the morgue.
Kill them. Kill them.
The bullets have to sever the electrodes to stop them.
Incredible.
With the last ounce of energy remaining, he's still trying to reach the source.
Are you all right?
Well, I wonder what we've got here.
Look at that, a birthday present from Uncle Dave.
Isn't that pretty?
Oh, but isn't he coming?
No, no. I'm afraid he'll have to be away for a while.
Why? I'm not mad at him anymore.
It's not that, Penny. it's business.
Look, Penny, why don't you name your new dolly Henrietta the second?
No. I'm going to call her Dave.
Dave? Dave's a boy's name.
That's a girl doll you've got there.
I don't care.
I know.
I'll tell all my friends she's a tomboy.
Well, guess that ought to do it, huh?
All right, Penny.
See if you can blow these out now.
Here, Daddy, hold Dave for me.
All righty.
Take a deep breath now.
Get ready.
Come on, blow. Come on.
- There.
- Wonderful, Penny.

Councilor! Councilor!
How disgraceful!
Calm yourselves.
Councilor... this is an urgent matter!
Tend to those two at once.
Yes, Sir!
- Hang in there! - Keep a hold of yourself!
- Hang on! - Stand steady!
Lord Kira?!
EDO MANSION OF THE ASANO CLAN
EDO MANSION OF THE ASANO CLAN
Stop fretting, Gengoemon. Kira Kozuke no Suke holds the fourth rank at court.
Stop fretting, Gengoemon. Kira Kozuke no Suke holds the fourth rank at court.
If anything, offering him a bribe now would be disrespectful.
But, My Lord, many Daimyo have already suffered at his hands.
For instance, Matsudaira Totomi no
Kami and Honda Yamato no Kami...
...were shamed deeply by Lord Kira, and bloodshed was only narrowly avoided.
This is about a ceremony to welcome...
...both the Imperial Envoy, Great Councilor
Yanagiwara, and Mid-Councilor Seikan'in.
If people heard that someone from the Asano Clan...
...had bribed Kira, not only would it go against my family's customs...
...it would be an inexcusable slight against the Imperial Envoy!
Yes, My Lord, but Lord Kira's behavior in the palace yesterday...
...was absolutely outrageous!
Enough! Don't say any more, Gengo.
Go and prepare for my visit to the palace.
["Gengo:" Short for "Gengoemon."]
Thank you, Lord Kira.
It is all thanks to you...
...that yesterday's welcoming ceremony went so perfectly.
Nonsense, Lord Date. Unlike Lord Asano, you are attentive in all things...
...and you take in everything
I say with good grace, so it's a pleasure to guide you.
Please, feel free to consult me at any time.
You have my humble thanks.
Lord Kira, I humbly request instruction on how to best attend the Imperial Envoys.
You should have some idea how to do that without me telling you every little thing.
Do what's proper.
But I am ignorant and unschooled in the manners of court nobles...
...and the Council of Elders has told me to seek your guidance in everything.
Well, if you insist, I suppose
I can spare a word or two.
Gifts are vital to official functions.
Gifts?
Yes. You must treat the Envoys with esteem.
You should give them gifts every day.
I understand.
Also, please tell me what I should do regarding the replacement of tatami mats at Fukoin...
...where I'll be entertaining them during their visit to Zojoji Temple.
Oh, there's no need to go to such lengths.
Lord Tsuchiya Sagami no Kami is the presiding Elder this month.
I asked his steward, who told me that whatever Lord Kira may have said...
...daily gifts would be both preposterous, and regarded as quite rude.
In fact, it's never been done.
We must merely spare no effort to properly entertain them.
So it's as I thought.
How dare he play me for a fool!
Was he just pressing for a bribe?
My Lord, this weighty task is almost upon us. Please, just endure until then.
Oh, don't look at that.
That gift's from a hick Daimyo who struts around...
...talking about Bushido in this peaceful Genroku era! Toss it out.
But, My Lord, he did go to the trouble.
Wouldn't it be best to at least examine it?
These days, one must often forget Bushido and adopt a more flexible approach.
I know what the typical Asano family gift is like without having to look.
I shall examine it, then.
I see... I can just picture the haughty look on Asano's face.
See? I told you not to look.
First last night, then tonight... we have never seen you like this before.
My Lady is worried that your current state duties are causing you great distress.
There's no need for concern.
Everything is going smoothly, thanks to Lord Kira's instructions.
No need to fear.
Now, pour me another...
You have not been looking well.
Please be mindful of your health until this ceremony is over.
It's not something I'm used to, so I'm just anxious not to make a mistake.
I'm sorry I worried you.
Oh, what nonsense.
We are family!
My Lord, Chief Retainer
Yasui Hikoemon...
...requests an audience with you, about an urgent matter.
What? You say Asano asked the Elder about gifts to the Envoys?
Yes. Date Sakyo no Suke's Chief
Retainer just sent word.
Did he say I'd told him to give gifts?
I'm told that, from observations of their conversation, it seemed so.
Damn that Asano...
What is this "urgent business"?
My Lord, according to what Horibe and Maebara have heard, the Date Clan have just finished... replacing all the tatami mats in the room where they'll host their guest...
...during his visit to Zojoji Temple.
What?! They replaced the tatami?! Damn that Kira, he's made a fool of me again!
There is no way we can replace
200 tatami mats in time...
...to pass the inspection tomorrow morning, My Lord!
We won't?!
My Lord, we'll get it done by morning even... if we have to round up every tatami weaver in Edo!
Please don't worry.
That hick of a Daimyo...
We have to finish this by morning!
I'm counting on you all!
- What time is it?
- 11 PM, My Lord.
And there's no word from Gengo?
None.
Lord... won't you try to get some sleep?
You go on to bed ahead of me.
- How many left?!
- Another 40.
We're almost there!
I'm counting on you all!
Oh, My Lord!
What is it?!
All the tatami mats have been replaced.
My thanks...
My deepest thanks!
My Lord!
Yasubei, I thank you.
Sir...!
You are certainly blessed,
Lord Asano. Bravo.
Lord Asano.
Lord Asano!
If you require something,
I'll be happy to serve you.
The likes of you would not understand!
Lord Asano, what is this?!
Look at this screen!
If there is some problem with it, please tell me.
You fool! It's inexcusable to use a screen...
...with an India ink painting in the
Envoys' pilgrimage lodgings!
I'll wager you're just making do with whatever was lying around the temple!
If you weren't well-off, that would be one thing...
...but someone as rich as you should at least have a new screen made!
Are you really that much of a penny-pincher?
Lord Kira, I must ask you to...
Enough!
It must be a headache having such hick samurai as your vassals, Lord Asano.
My Lord! My Lord...
Please wait!
I am grateful for your instructions.
At the ceremony for the reply to the Throne...
["Long Kamishimo," "Eboshi Daimon:"
Two types of formal samurai dress.]
...should I wear a long kamishimo?
Or should I wear eboshi daimon?
["Long Kamishimo," "Eboshi Daimon:"
Two types of formal samurai dress.]
["Long Kamishimo," "Eboshi Daimon:"
Two types of formal samurai dress.]
A long kamishimo should be fine.
You should know that much!
We just have to endure this for one more day. Be patient!
"We have been hearing of Lord Kira's behavior for some time..."
Kuranosuke...
I thank you for your concern.
It sounds like a most sympathetic and encouraging letter.
Remember, after today's ceremony, your work will be done.
I pray you will get through your duties for this one day.
Don't worry.
All right. Tonight, regale me with your stories.
I know what to do.
Set your mind at ease.
My Lord, what's the matter?!
Gengo, I've been duped.
Everyone's dressed in eboshi daimon for this ceremony!
I've made a terrible mistake!
Have no fear. We have your formal dress all laid out.
What?!
We brought them, just in case of this very mistake.
Gengo... Gengo!
Thank you so much!
Toda.
Yes?
My Lord said we need only endure for this one day, correct?
The Imperial Envoys have reached the Nakasuzume Gate!
Lord Kira! The Envoys will enter the palace any minute!
As their host, should I greet them on the raised platform... in the entryway, or down by the door?
Please, tell me! Please!
Lord Asano, you're incorrigible.
You must be well aware of the answer.
Are you mocking this old man?
No, not at all! Please, help me!
Have you lost your mind?
You're serious, aren't you?
Lord Asano, it's absurd for you to be asking such questions, today of all days!
Lord Kira!
You're within the palace.
You do know that?
You mean to kill me, the Kozuke?
Fine, you just try it!
If you unleash that sword from its scabbard one tiny bit...
...your land is gone and your family name is history.
If that doesn't bother you, sure, go right ahead!
What's the matter, Lord Asano?
You insolent fool!
Please forgive me.
I bow in humble apology for my blunder!
Please, please instruct me!
Lord Asano.
When the Envoys' audience with the
Shogun is over, please let me know.
His honored mother,
Lady Keishoin, is eager to visit with them and inquire after their health.
I understand.
I am not sure what you need,
Lord Kajikawa...
...but if you have any questions, please allow me to assist you.
This hick of a Daimyo couldn't help... he doesn't know a scrap of etiquette!
Hold it right there, Kozuke!
Now you'll pay!
What are you doing?!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Are you mad?!
This is the palace!
Let me go! If you have any warrior spirit in your soul, let me go!
["Ninjyo:" Lit., "wounded by sword." Drawing a sword in the palace was a very serious crime.]
Bloodshed! Blood! Bloodshed!
Bloodshed!
Bloodshed!
Bloodshed!
Bloodshed!
["Metsuke:" A Shogunate Inspector who investigated important crimes, including corruption and treason.]
I, Metsuke Okado Denpachiro, am making a formal inquiry.
First, tell us the circumstances behind this incident.
["Takumi no Kami:" Lord Asano's formal title.]
Why did Takumi no Kami draw his blade?
You must have done something.
My Lord, I am only an old man.
I cannot remember doing anything to cause
Lord Asano the slightest grudge.
Also, because we are on palace grounds, and particularly in view of the occasion...
...I tried to dodge him instead of parrying.
Now I have wounds even on my back.
I beg you to intercede with the Shogun for me.
You say that you have done nothing to offend him?
Exactly. I cannot understand his attack at all.
My Lady, something horrible has happened.
To my Lord?
Yes. He drew his sword against Kira Kozuke no Suke...
...in the Pine Hall of Edo Palace.
And Kozuke?
Is he alive?!
Silence! If you were in your right mind, why would you have done this?
There must be no falsehoods in your written submissions to this court.
"I, Takumi no Kami, suddenly drew my sword in a fit of madness."
You, write that down.
Please, wait.
I am deeply grateful for your mercy in leaving me my 53,000-koku of land.
However, I am the Lord of Ako Castle.
If my official reason is that I lost my senses, I will be a laughingstock.
The truth is that I drew my sword against Kozuke...
...because I could no longer hold back my resentment.
Tamura Kyodaiyu, presenting myself here on your orders.
The Shogun has instructed me,
Dewa no Kami, to convey his decision.
This morning, Takumi no Kami caused an uproar in the palace that showed...
...disrespect, both to the court and to his duty as host to the Imperial Envoys.
Therefore, the Shogun considers his actions a great outrage.
He commands that Takumi no Kami immediately travel to Lord Tamura's estate...
...and once there, commit seppuku.
- Seppuku?
- Yes.
And what of Kozuke no Suke?
Well... the Shogun considers it laudable that Kozuke no Suke...
...honored the court and restrained himself, out of consideration for the time and place...
...even though he faced mortal danger.
Therefore, he is to receive no punishment, and his wounds are to be treated.
Lord Takumi no Kami is master of a castle controlling 53,000-koku in income.
I fear that the decision for him to immediately commit seppuku...
...has been made too hastily.
It is the Shogun's order!
Wait!
With all due respect, if he testifies that he attacked because of a personal grudge...
...we cannot be certain Kozuke no
Suke's behavior was correct...
...without closely investigating the nature of the animus.
Above all, after my initial investigation, there are several matters that are not yet clear.
Lord Okado, are you protesting the Shogun's decision?
I am a Metsuke.
To uphold the law of the land, when I feel that a decision may not be universally accepted...
...I must venture to offer my counsel.
Silence! The Shogun has already given his order.
Please, wait.
Since Lord Ieyasu's time it has been the rule that both parties are to blame...
...for quarrels within the palace.
If Takumi no Kami is to commit seppuku...
...I believe Kozuke no Suke should face some punishment as well.
If nothing else, a few years ago, other Daimyo...
...such as Matsudaira Totomi no Kami and Honda Sado no Kami...
No more! Do you oppose the Shogun?!
Restrain yourself!
The chief coroner,
Shimousa no Kami...
...and Lord Okado Denpachiro, the Metsuke, have arrived.
What's the meaning of this?! No other
Daimyo ordered to commit seppuku...
...has ever been forced to do it in the garden!
And this "crime" Takumi no Kami has committed is hardly...
Lord Yanagizawa consulted the
Shogun out on the matter...
...and was told to punish
Asano as a criminal.
["Ometsuke:" Shogunate Chief Inspector who handled investigations involving Daimyo and senior officials.]
Hold on! Is it proper for an Ometsuke to simply do as Lord Yanagizawa desires?
Restrain yourself!
Remember where you are!
Lord Asano, it's time to prepare yourself.
A vassal of Takumi no Kami, Kataoka
Gengoemon, has just arrived.
Gengoemon is here?
He requests a brief audience with the Lord.
No one will be allowed to see him.
I allow it!
Send him to the garden.
Yes, sir!
My Lord...
My Lord!
My Lord!
Gengo?
My Lord...
It was good of you to come.
If I may carry a message to anyone, it's...
It's the least I can do!
Even just one sentence!
When you see Oishi in Ako...
...just tell him I am consumed with remorse.
My Lord...
I will tell him without fail!
This is goodbye.
My Lord!
Leave.
I will pass it on.
"The wind carries away... the cherry blossoms...
...yet I grieve more... for the passing of spring itself."
"I grieve more... for the passing of spring itself."
Quiet! We are asking you all how far you're prepared to go.
How does refusing to give up the castle show our devotion?
I don't see how we'd be showing loyalty to our dead Lord...
...by defending this castle, when it will make his merchants and farmers suffer...
...and bring down disaster upon his family and all their relatives!
What are you talking about?!
We won't set one foot out of this castle!
It would be a disgrace to the honor of Ako!
Shogunate regulations specify that both parties...
...are to blame for fights within the palace!
Now that they've trampled on that rule, honor forbids us from handing over this castle!
But if the Shogun has decreed it, we have no choice but to obey!
Seeking even more suffering would be disloyal to our Lord!
Arguing any more is pointless.
All those who agree with
Ono should leave now!
Yes, we should!
Men, do you understand what I'm saying?
If you let momentary passions make you stay here, it'll be fatal!
Do you want to add another treachery to the list?!
First of all, isn't it odd that
Councilor Oishi isn't here?!
Silence! Councilor Oishi is hoping for responsible behavior from us all!
There's no need to pretend.
All of you who agree with Ono... begone!
The passions of the moment will become treachery!
Traitors!
I'm no traitor!
Traitors!
Traitors!
Councilor, this is a letter written in blood...
...from those vassals in Edo who have sworn to live or die with you!
Councilor!
We are all prepared to die to defend this castle.
You attest that you're resolved to defend the castle...
...even if the Shogunate brands you rebels and traitors?
You need not even ask!
"NATURALLY, EVERYONE WAS EVICTED FROM
THE ASANO FAMILY'S CITY RESIDENCE."
The Metsuke is here to make his inspection! Hurry up and leave!
Wait! Wait, wait, wait!
I just want to say a word of greeting to Lord Okado.
No! Your time is up! Get out!
No! Your time is up! Get out!
- Wait! Wait!
Okano, stop!
Stop it.
Stop this commotion!
Lord Okado, I'll express my deep gratitude for your consideration...
...during our master's seppuku, and then I'll take my leave.
I know how you must feel, being chased out like stray dogs.
Then I would like to ask you one question.
Yes?
Does Lord Kira still live?
What?
I beg you...
I beg you, please tell us.
His life is in no danger.
Now leave.
Sir...
We evicted his retainers from the
Edo residence without incident...
...but many in Ako, led by their councilor, Oishi...
...seem prepared to defend the castle to the death.
I trust there were no problems deploying
Honda and Matsudaira's troops to Ako?
None whatsoever.
Wakizaka Awaji no Kami is prepared for that as well, so if worst comes to worst...
...we'll break up the whole castle and clan, and confiscate everything.
This should put all those country
Daimyo in their places.
APRIL 17TH
APRIL 17TH
I was eager to go down in glory, defending this castle to the death...
I was eager to go down in glory, defending this castle to the death...
...against those coming to take it.
I feel some regret that I cannot.
It is easy to die a glorious death in battle, but it would cause trouble for the people of our fief.
Yes, I am sure that to quietly follow our Lord is true loyalty.
Today we see Ako Castle for the last time.
Emoshichi! You have a sick father to look after.
You mustn't die here.
With all due respect, Councilor, please look at this.
My father despaired that he could not help the Asano Clan in its time of need...
...so he... he...
He took his own life?
Yes.
I want to join him, and go to meet our dead Lord!
No! You haven't come of age yet.
I won't allow you to rush blindly into death.
Councilor, if you refuse because
I am not of age, then what of Chikara?
Why can he participate?
Why do you refuse death only to me?
Emoshichi, well said!
We both aim for the same thing!
Yes!
Father, please allow Emoshichi to follow our Lord into death!
Wait! Wait, wait, wait...
C... Councilor!
Kazuemon?
I have been a ronin for the three years since I angered Lord Asano...
...and now I will never have the chance to gain his pardon!
I have come here so that I can at least seek it in the afterlife.
Whether I slept in the fields or the mountains at night...
...not a single day has passed when I didn't pine for my master!
I, Kazuemon, have prepared myself.
I beseech you...
Please let me follow my dead Lord!
I beg you!
No. I can't believe you would ask to follow my Lord to death...
...when he was still furious with you!
I will gain his forgiveness in the afterlife!
Emoshichi, don't let him beat you!
Right!
Councilor, prepare yourself.
Wait, men.
We're canceling this seppuku!
- What?!
- What?!
First you ask us to defend the castle to the death...
...then today you decide we're following our master...
...and now you call off our seppuku?!
It's heartless! You can only mock a man so much!
My Lord has faithful retainers.
I think...
...he must surely...
...be pleased right now.
Yet Kira Kozuke still breathes!
APRIL 18TH
Kuranosuke, your surrender of the castle was truly remarkable.
Every detail meticulously accounted for, from the first bow to the last pair of sandals!
You've quite impressed me.
I beg you with all my heart...
...to appoint my late master's younger brother, Lord Daigaku, as his heir.
If only all retainers were like you!
NAMEPLATE: "KIRA"
So they peacefully surrendered the castle, eh?
Oishi may be a wise man, but he couldn't think his way out of that one! Excellent, excellent.
Father, they say Oishi petitioned for Takumi no Kami's brother, Daigaku, to succeed him.
What? Such insolence!
I'm told that the Shogun's anger at Takumi no Kami was extreme.
I imagine he wouldn't dream of allowing the succession.
Obviously not!
This is the end of the Asano line!
But we don't know what his ronin in Ako and Edo will do.
My Lord, you must be very cautious, as they must be seeking vengeance against you.
W... What do mean, vengeance?
Hyobu!
Father was the one who was cut, and the Shogun ordered the seppuku!
They have no right to seek
"vengeance" against me!
If there's any target for revenge here, it's the Shogun!
Those hick samurai won't understand that.
Don't say that!
Oishi is the wisest man in Ako.
I believe extreme caution is necessary.
And the brilliant way in which he handled the surrender of the castle...
...has everyone in government saying how clever he is.
He didn't even defend his castle with his life! What can he do?
Rumor has it that Oishi bought a huge estate at Yamashina in Kyoto.
Then we can't be too careful.
Make sure you keep watch on that place at all times, from inside and out.
All these hick samurai know how to do is draw their swords at the drop of a hat.
I can't believe you,
Lord Awaji...
...letting that hick councilor, Oishi, talk you into bringing me such a petition.
I have to say it seems a little childish.
No, Oishi is a truly admirable person.
And I thought a bit of benevolent governance would mute any public criticism...
...that ordering Takumi no
Kami's seppuku was unjust...
...in view of the
"both sides at fault" rule.
Lord Awaji, I am the
Shogun's grand chamberlain.
I can't bring him a request that would conflict with his wishes!
I understand, but I am told this incident has all of
Edo speaking ill of the government.
I feel it's worth bearing in mind.
I'm shocked that even you, the head of the Elders, would say such things!
If you rate Oishi's abilities that highly, you should hire him.
How dare you!
Lord Yanagizawa,
I think you're crossing the line!
YAMASHINA
Welcome home.
- Welcome home, Father!
- Welcome home, Father!
Who is this?
I am Okahei; I have an introduction from Sir Den'emon.
Ah, you look like a strong young man.
You've been tired day and night...
Are you sure you're not having a little too much sake?
I understand you're leaving for Edo soon.
If it should affect your health...
Father.
Where's Chikara?
He rushed off to his uncle's for something.
Is this trip to Edo about the request for Lord Daigaku's succession?
It seems like everyone in
Edo is tired of waiting...
Edo, eh?
It's been three years...
EDO
Move it!
It's Lord Kira.
Check out the showy procession!
Acting all important just because
Lord Yanagizawa backs him.
Lord Asano of Ako sure got the raw end of the deal.
Yeah, but Lord Kira's the one whose head is gonna roll!
Sir, I, err...
Never mind, just come with me.
You may dress like a townsman, but
I won't tolerate that look in your eyes.
Sir, I promise you
I'm no one suspicious.
Come on.
Where on Earth are you taking me, sir?
Strange how fate keeps bringing us together.
But you'd never get Kira like that.
What do you mean?
This "Kira" person you...
Silence.
You're... Lord Okado!
I remember meeting you when
I cleared out your master's home.
You have my most sincere thanks for your consideration that day.
Is this a plan of Kondo Nobori no Suke's estate?
I'm sure that Takumi no Kami is pleased, in the next world, as he watches...
...his men work so strenuously and tirelessly at the risk of their own lives.
I can't stop seeing the moment of his seppuku in my mind.
We have not yet toiled enough.
There are those who have said goodbye forever to their wives and mothers.
The estate on that map is empty right now.
You should reconnoiter it now, while you can.
Who... what are you saying, my Lord?
You're a poor imitation of a townsman.
Any halfwit could tell you were a samurai in one glance.
Sir, you look ill.
What's the matter?
Something troublesome has happened.
The Kira household is being moved from Sukiyabashi to Honjyo.
And to the old home of that ruffian
Kondo Nobori no Suke!
How do you explain that?
Well, you're obviously asking me after you've already come to a conclusion.
I suppose it's because if the ronin of
Ako did attack Lord Kira's estate...
...it would be too close to the palace for comfort.
You think so too?
If we assume this to be true, then as long as Lord Kira is not near the palace...
...the Shogun will not officially notice our security measures.
But sir, do you really think the ronin of Ako will risk everything to attempt their vengeance?
What do you think?
I understand this "Oishi" is highly regarded.
I would say this is because he has the public's sympathy.
He and I differ there.
But hasn't it been six months since
Takumi no Kami drew his sword?
If they meant to kill Lord Kira and were willing to die for it, they've already had chances.
Fine, fine.
Rui... eventually I'll have a job for you to do.
I hear Oishi is coming to Edo soon.
I have no idea what he'll do.
We must be on our guard.
NANBUZAKA, RESIDENCE OF YOZEN'IN
This is the first time I've seen you since my late husband's seppuku.
I can't help but cry.
My Lady does nothing but worry about the troubles our vassals must face...
...now that they've left the fief.
All those who would scatter have scattered.
Now if young Lord Daigaku could just receive an estate of even 10,000-koku...
Kuranosuke!
Your late master cast away 53,000- koku to attack Lord Kira.
Surely you have not forgotten.
Otaka, Yoshida, Horibe and his son, and the other prominent vassals...
...who remain in Edo sometimes visit me...
...and they tell me they've all placed themselves in your hands.
You could carry out my Lord's will whenever you had a mind do.
With all due respect,
My Lady...
Are you suggesting there is a spy in this house?
I believe my visit here is known to...
We are told you've been buying up farmland in Yamashina...
...and have so lost yourself to wine and women that this is your first visit to Edo.
Is this a ploy to deceive our enemy?
Toda! Don't scold him.
I am sure Kuranosuke has his reasons.
I am Oishi Kuranosuke, former retainer at Ako.
It'd be most bothersome if you mistook me for someone else.
This is absurd!
Identify yourselves!
Since you refuse,
I assume you know who I am.
I suppose I have no choice but to fight.
He's tough!
Idiots!
I won't allow such violence!
Lower your swords. Now!
There will be no violence on the doorstep of Metsuke Okado Denpachiro!
Retreat! Retreat!
I cannot thank you enough for intervening.
No need, Oishi.
But you are unfamiliar with Edo.
Happily, one of my regular merchants...
...is just returning to Nihonbashi;
I'll have him show you home.
Hey!
Sir?
Oh, it's you!
I never dreamed I'd find you in Lord Okado's home.
Councilor, it's you!
I haven't seen you since our master's seppuku.
When I heard you were in Edo,
I went to your inn...
...but they told me you left this morning without telling anyone where you were going.
I was worried. It's very dangerous to walk around unescorted.
Sir, Lord Okado did me an immense kindness...
...concerning Kira Kozuke no
Suke's move to Honjyo.
Oishi, the townspeople have already caught wind of your visit to Edo.
Edoites are quick to jump to conclusions...
...and there are already rumors that the time for vengeance at hand.
Even a Metsuke cannot control the tongues of the masses...
...and so I thought it best to mention this to you.
Ah, then I must have caused you a lot of trouble.
After I petition for Lord Daigaku to succeed his brother,
...I'll be returning to
Kyoto immediately.
Keep back!
Why so flustered,
Lord Shimizu?
- Where's the chief councilor?
- He's in the bath right now.
I've done something terrible.
What's the matter?
I must apologize to him immediately.
So you didn't manage to kill Oishi?
What? You knew about that?!
The ronin we hired foolishly attacked him right on Metsuke Okado's doorstep.
Oh no, for him of all people to get involved...
Was anyone hurt?
Two were cut down.
Is Oishi that talented?
I trust you made sure there is no evidence of our involvement?
This Oishi is no ordinary man.
He shouted at the top of his voice at us, asking if we knew who he was.
Now, we can't have you, of all people, afraid of him.
I received this map from Lord Okado...
...several days before Kira switched lodgings.
Thanks to it, I was able to inspect every nook and cranny before he moved in.
And I was able to open a trinket shop right in front of it.
This has been of great help to our comrades, sir.
And now that we are fortunate enough to have you in Edo...
...we'd like to settle things within the next couple of months.
Sir, over time, even those who once doubted us have come to see what's right...
...and by the time you left Kyoto, there were over 120 names on our blood compact.
Bushido has not yet died out!
This many people raiding Kira's mansion would be truly magnificent!
Sir, if you're carrying the blood compact now, please show it to us.
The blood compact!
Our scroll isn't here!
Where is it?
Why don't you keep them together?
We are comrades!
I'll do it after Lord Daigaku's succession is decided.
Sir, we pledged our lives in blood.
I cannot understand this.
Sir, don't you believe in us?
Of course I'd like to believe.
"Like to"?
Don't you understand how your comrades feel...
...bearing all their pain silently for the sake of their revenge?
Yoshida, and all the rest of you, you should try to stay away from Yozen'in's house.
Why would you say that?!
What happened to me tonight is an excellent example.
Rui, you will go to Kyoto.
Me, sir?
You are the only one who can do this, Rui.
Am I to spy on Oishi?
Is he an unworthy opponent?
No...
Heihachiro is already in Yamashina.
Oh, my...
Are you telling us to endure silently until
Lord Daigaku's succession is decided?!
You're asking for a lot of patience!
What'll we do if the old bat dies?!
I'm a full eight years older than Kira.
I can't afford the luxury of time.
Don't you understand the pain those of us in Edo have felt all this time?!
My late master...
I can still picture the moment of his seppuku.
I'm ashamed of my weakness!
Father, why don't the two of us go and kill Kira then?!
Wait!
Do you still not understand what's in my heart?
Behind our enemy Kira, there lurks Lord Yanagizawa.
He's the infection that is corrupting the government.
To make Yanagizawa regret what he did to our master...
...and eradicate the root of such evil from the Shogunate, we must wait to kill Kira...
...until we know the result of our bid for Lord Daigaku's succession.
If we broke into his home like burglars, it would be a disgrace to the name of Asano!
Ours must be a just vengeance, one that shames us before no one!
Our Lord was sentenced, as if he were a criminal...
...to commit seppuku in the garden...
...a death that no other Daimyo has ever been ordered to endure!
Do you think we can avenge
Takumi no Kami...
...that we can purge his bitterness this way?
I beg you all to consider that all your suffering...
...will have been for nothing... if the smallest part of our secret leaks out.
Sir, I have taken your words to heart today!
Now...
...I suppose I'll go back to Kyoto...
...and continue to debauch myself.
AND SO, HALF A YEAR PASSES...
Guy who's "it", guy who's "it", come toward the clapping!
Guy who's "it", guy who's "it", come toward the clapping!
Guy who's "it", guy who's "it", come toward the clapping!
Guy who's "it", guy who's "it", come toward the clapping!
Guy who's "it", guy who's "it", come toward the clapping!
Guy who's "it", guy who's "it", come toward the clapping!
Guy who's "it", guy who's "it", come toward the clapping!
Got you!
- No, no! That's Rui, the waitress!
- Okay, now you're It!
My, my, what a beautiful waitress.
Quiet now, that's enough!
I'm tired of playing with you girls.
Come on, Rui, let's drink!
Let's drink! Come on!
Come on, Rui. Everyone, come!
Oishi, sir,
I'd like a word with you!
I am Sekine Yajiro, a ronin of Echigo.
I'm sorry to intrude upon your merrymaking, but there's something
I'd like to discuss with you.
My, what a boor!
- What a boor!
- Sure, sure... come over here!
Come on over here...
All right, what is it?
What is it, then?
Sir, it's been a year and a half since
Lord Asano's bitter death.
Yet you show no sign of finishing things!
What is the meaning of this?!
People have always spoken most highly of you...
...and everyone just assumed you'd rectify the Shogunate's mistake about Kira Kozuke...
- Who goes there?!
- Now, now, it's fine.
The women probably just came to see what was going on.
Sir!
We've been eagerly waiting, counting the hours until you stand up for your late Lord!
So you must be another of those people who tell me to avenge him, eh?
Certainly!
We firmly believe in you!
Sorry, but this revenge thing is pointless.
What? Oishi!
Do you mean that?
Do you mean what you're saying?!
Just think about it.
The Asano Clan fell because of one moment of lost restraint!
No, no, I myself might be doing all right, but the other vassals have dispersed.
A short-tempered master is a terrible thing.
What's more, Lord Kira was the one who was cut!
I couldn't get "revenge" even if I wanted to!
Oh! Oh, how about you?
What would...
What would you do?
You cowardly dog of a samurai!
You almost made a dog of me, too!
Now, say what you want, but once a man dies, he never comes back.
While you're alive, drink good sake and dally with beautiful women.
That's the joy of this mortal world.
Enough! You bastard,
I'll cut you down!
- I can't let you do that!
- Stop!
Out of the way!
Ukihashi! Ukihashi!
Please calm down!
Move!
Move, woman!
I will not. You're being rude.
What?!
I may be a harlot, but this is still my room.
You could say I, Ukihashi, am queen of the castle here.
I won't let you barge in without permission.
Kuranosuke! Killing scum like you would just soil my sword!
Out of my way!
Scary, scary.
["Uki-sama:" Oishi's nickname]
Now, let's go cheer "Uki-sama" up!
Let's!
Stop it! Do you want to be bitten by dogs?
Never come between people in love.
You dense girls!
Come on, this way.
You're not injured?
I am impressed by your patience.
I'm sure that deep down...
Hello? Uki-sama?
Oh...
Asleep already...
Is he really so scared to die he'll put up with that?!
I know! And he calls himself a samurai?
I'm finally disgusted with Uki-sama.
Is he besotted with Ukihashi?
Truly!
I don't care if he is one of our best customers...
I wouldn't want a spineless samurai like that!
Is that what you all think?
I don't see it that way.
Then how do you see it, Karimo?
He isn't such a coward.
If he were, Ukihashi wouldn't have fallen for him.
Well, you're sure taken with him!
Where is Oishi?!
In that room over there.
Wake up! Uki-sama... you have guests.
Sir, it's me, Junai.
And Yasubei.
W... We're sorry, but we'd like to speak in private.
Ah, you two.
Well, well!
Sir!
You're here about Lord Daigaku's reduction in rank?
Yes, sir. Not only was Lord Daigaku denied succession...
...they reduced his income by 3,000-koku and sent him to live with his relatives in Geishu.
Sir, the last hope of restoring the Asano Clan is gone.
There's no longer...
There's no longer any...!
Ukihashi! Where did Ukihashi go?
Hey! Ukihashi!
Oh, Ukihashi!
- Sir!
- Sir!
Ukihashi! Hey! Uki...
Oh, have you seen Ukihashi?
Yes, just go that way...
Hey! Ukihashi!
Sir...
Master Oishi is returning home.
- Children, it's your father!
- It's Father?
Is that the light of the
Nikenjyaya teahouse?
Or the light of Maruyama?
I'm home!
- Come on! Ugh...
- Look out!
Ah, here we are...
Welcome home, Uki-sama.
Ah, Riku. Let's have some sake!
- Uki-sama...
- Oh! Wait, wait Riku!
She's all muddy.
Wipe her feet, will you?
- Oh, no, you don't have to do that!
- Hey, what's taking so long?!
Go get some sake!
Father!
Oh, Chikara...
What's with that face?
Father, this is going too far!
While you've been out misbehaving every night...
...Mother has waited for you patiently here with the children, without a single complaint!
Every time I see her lonely face, it cuts me to the bone!
It wounds me every day, but I've endured it, because I knew there must be a reason!
Now, Chikara, you mustn't be so rude to your father.
I must and I will! You come home for the first time in days...
...but you don't even hug your young children!
You tell my mother to get you sake and wipe the feet of a dirty harlot!
I'm going to buy the freedom of that "dirty harlot."
Husband, is that true?
I'm sick of you, you washed-up old housewife.
Here are your divorce papers.
Father!
We're over! We're through!
Kuranosuke.
Oh, hello, Mother.
You'd better not send Riku back to her parents...
...so that you can bring a prostitute here.
As your mother,
I won't stand for it!
Mother, it's all right.
No, I've been enduring this scandalous dissipation...
...because I was sure he was doing it to fool our enemies.
Riku, you mustn't think I've been spoiling him just because he's my son.
No, ma'am.
I completely understand.
Kuranosuke! This has been hard on your mother...
...but it's been even harder on Riku!
Riku, I'm amazed you've stuck with him this long.
I can't tell you how grateful I am.
And now you want to divorce your loyal wife?!
Yes... Yes.
Something wrong with that?
Kuranosuke, are you...
M... Mother!
Oh, hey! Hey, Ukihashi!
Where are you going?
Kuranosuke...
Could it be that the time has come for you to go to Edo?
Kuranosuke, why don't you answer me?
Is there something you can't say in front of your own mother...
...and your wife of many years?
Mother... please lay off.
If this is about going to Edo,
I'm sure Riku would be happy to hear it.
Now, tell us.
A single word is enough.
Enough! "Revenge this,"
"revenge that"...
Is there someplace I can go where they don't know that word?
Kuranosuke! Are you saying you have no intention of avenging your dead Lord?
None! None whatsoever!
Oh, you traitor!
You disrespectful son!
I didn't raise you to be so unfaithful and ungrateful!
Mother!
Divorced! We're through!
If you're tossing Riku out,
I won't stay either!
Come on, everyone, let's go.
Yes.
Will you go to Tajima with your mother?
Or stay here with your father?
Father...!
Decide for yourself.
I'm 15 now, Father.
I won't slow you down, so please take me with you!
Kuranosuke.
I cannot leave our late Lord's memorial tablet here...
...so I'm taking it with me.
Any objections?
A strange thing to ask for!
Do what you like.
TABLET: "WORLDLY NAME:
OISHI KURANOSUKE"
Riku! Riku!
Yes?
And so, Husband...
...I bid you farewell.
Please... take care of the children.
I will.
And you, Husband...
The weather is growing very changeable...
...so please be mindful of your health.
You too...
My mother is old, so please make sure she is careful.
I will.
We'll bring you back lots of presents, Father.
Look after the house while we're gone!
Have you said your goodbyes?
The palanquin is waiting.
You should tend to your health!
Now, let's go.
I'll see you off.
Now say goodbye to Father.
Goodbye!
Goodbye, big brother.
Take care of yourself.
Goodbye!
Goodbye!
Father!
Where is Kuranosuke?
He's bought Ukihashi's freedom, and now he's drinking more heavily than ever.
It's just as you said.
He's going to Edo.
He even renounced his wife and children, all to trick us.
Are you telling me to kill Oishi?
I... I can't do it!
Have you fallen for him just like Ukihashi?!
You wouldn't understand.
But if I fail, please tell
Councilor Chisaka...
...that he was right about
Oishi, and I was wrong.
What does that mean?
If you tell him, he'll understand.
Sir...
I've brought you some tea.
Rui...
Y... Yes?
You can have that ball.
But sir, that ball is...
My youngest daughter's.
Well, I think I'll have some of that tea.
- Rui...
- Yes?
You've often said that Kyoto...
...is a better place than Edo.
Yes.
A woman's happiness...
...comes from having a good husband...
...and being surrounded by her beloved children.
Do you think you can do that, Rui?
If you can do it, Uki-sama...
...then I should be able to recognize the sound of a child's ball.
What's wrong? You're shaking.
I think I'll head out now.
She's botched it.
Let me go! There's no time!
You won't...
You won't be able to kill him!
I'm not in love with him!
You mustn't! You'll just die a dog's death!
You're no match for him. Don't do it!
Unhand me!
Father, we were right... it's Okahei.
Chisaka Hyobu sent him.
Hyobu...
As we expected, Asano Daigaku was denied his succession.
An excellent cautionary example.
I find it truly regrettable,
My Lord.
How unfortunate that Lord Yanagizawa was not a bit more judicious!
What would you do if you were in the government?
I would have granted him the succession and 10,000-koku of income.
Do you think that would lessen the danger to my father's life?
That is part of it...
...but the Takumi no
Kami incident...
...is also causing an unexpected public rejection of Yanagizawa's governance.
Enough!
Be sure you guard my father well!
Necessary though it was,
I ask your forgiveness...
...for my misconduct and my waste of so much money.
Nonsense!
You have our sympathies, in particular for the way you had to part from your family.
The time is coming when the rest of you will...
...also have to leave your families forever.
From now on, your comrades here are your brothers.
Yes, but look at this!
Sir, I'm overcome with shame about how
I cursed your methods last year in Edo.
When they heard Lord Daigaku's request for succession was denied...
...72 men came to me with all sorts of excuses for taking their names off the list.
Only 47 of us left...
Father, may we get out the tools we've prepared for the raid?
Open them!
We'll let the winds from Mt. Fuji clear the smoke in our hearts...
...and see the moon over Kiyomigaseki.
If afterwards we could live on in memory...
...we would be held up as examples of filial devotion.
Oh, what happiness!
ASSEMBLING IN EDO
Oh, what happiness!
Oh, what happiness!
This express letter from Kyoto says they'll be splitting... into five groups and coming to Edo.
Oishi's group is the largest.
I hope that they arrive safely...
What are Kira's defenses like, Okano?
Sir, they're extremely tight.
What's more, Kira's refurbished the inside of his mansion, so we don't know the layout.
I don't see Akagaki or Katsuta...
Maki, leave us alone for a bit.
Another brotherly fight?
Hmm? Oh, no, none of that today.
Genzo, do you know what the townsfolk of Edo are saying?
They're calling the Ako ronin a bunch of cowards!
Brother, I wish you would stop bringing that up.
You absolutely refuse to bare your heart to me?
There's nothing to bare!
Lord Asano's the one who cut Kira in the first place...
...so taking revenge just isn't logical.
I'm your own brother!
Your own blood!
Yeah, but if there's no logic in revenge, what am I supposed to do about it?
Genzo! Your Lord gave you a stipend of 200-koku!
You're a disgrace to all samurai!
Brother, that was unusually violent of you.
Shut up!
Getting so angry is ruining your health.
From this moment on, you are no longer my brother!
There's no help for it...
Get out!
All right.
Take care. Goodbye.
You don't have to run away just because you saw me!
- But my clothes are so slovenly...
- Oh, husband, it's you!
Get in here!
Come on.
Where are you living?
I'm still masterless, so...
You and the other ronin must be working so hard!
I am proud. Shinza... when will you take your revenge?
Revenge is the furthest thing from my mind, sir!
Nonsense, Shinza. You're the son-in-law
I chose myself! Why hide it from me?
Every time I see those dirty clothes,
I am so grateful to you.
Father, I must take my leave.
Wait! At least greet our child!
Go away, we're having an important conversation!
Shinza! Why do you hide this?!
As a gift to your dying father- in-law, tell me the truth!
Revenge is impossible, sir!
What?!
Why, you!
Never darken my doorstep again!
"THIS ROOM: KAKIMI GOROBEI,
STEWARD TO THE KONOE"
Why are you attacking me?!
Shut up! You're not going to say that sign is a fake, are you?!
No, sir! Of course not!
Come, now, stop this violence.
But, sir...
- We have a problem!
- What?
I'll investigate this myself.
Take me to him.
Wait, everyone! Wait!
Our business is too important!
We have to dispose of him!
If we don't kill him, we'll never achieve our goal!
Stop! You're being too reckless! Now wait!
If we kill him, we'll be wanted men.
Our goal will be out of reach!
But sir, our backs are against the wall. We have no choice!
Wait.
I am the envoy of the Konoe Clan,
Kakimi Gorobei.
I'm obliged to ask you...
Are you calling yourself Kakimi Gorobei, envoy of the Konoe Clan?
- I am.
- What?
As you can see, we are transporting the tools for an important task.
What? "An important task"?
What task is that?
["Rinnoji no Miya:" A person, likely a member of the Imperial family]
We are delivering celebratory gifts from the Konoe Clan to Rinnoji no Miya.
Hmm... then I'll just have a look inside that chest!
Stop! You go too far!
How dare you!
I'm sure you have your reasons for appearing out of the blue...
...using my name, and treating me as an imposter.
Tell me what is going on.
The impudence!
You say that I am the imposter?
There is only one Kakimi
Gorobei in this world.
Then I'll ask you this: if you're really Kakimi Gorobei...
...I trust you carry promissory notes issued by the Konoe Clan?
Well?
Do you have them?
Let me see them.
How could I travel without promissory notes?
Quite. So let me see them.
Well? Come on.
P... Produce them!
You're a careful man.
Take a good look.
NOTE: THIS DESIGN IS
THE ASANO FAMILY CREST.
Asano...
Barbarians!
Get out!
Yes, My Lord!
Yes, My Lord!
That is unmistakably...
...a Konoe note.
I most humbly beg that you forgive me...
...for brashly using your name.
No need...
I fully realize that you only did so because circumstances required it.
Fellow samurai must support each other.
We are never so keenly grateful for the kindness of others...
...as when we have fallen on hard times.
I must make some small amends for what I've done.
These are the Konoe promissory notes that I forged.
Please, I want you to have them.
Sir Kakimi...
Journey without worry... I pray from the bottom of my heart...
...that you will successfully complete your task.
Farewell.
You say Okahei was killed?
Yes. I am sure he is no longer alive.
I see. I've had no letters from him since September 10th.
["Yamaoka:" Okahei's family name.]
That's the night that
Sir Yamaoka was killed.
Only moments before he died,
I was almost killed as well.
Councilor...
I asked him to tell you that you were right about Oishi, and I was wrong.
Yet now I am alive, and Yamaoka is dead.
What did Oishi do after that?
Since he sold off his temporary residence in Yamashina, he has not been seen.
I was sure he'd come to Edo, so I hurried to follow him here...
...but I have found no signs of him.
He couldn't have beaten you here.
From what you've seen of Oishi, do you think he'll take his revenge?
Yamaoka says in the letter that he probably doesn't intend to do it.
You wrote that he
did intend to.
What is it?
What is it?
Have you fallen in love with that dandy?
Even you think so? That's the same thing Yamaoka asked me.
No, no, consider that a joke.
There's one thing... one thing I am sure of.
I got it out of Oishi.
What? What is it?
[Note: March 14th is the day Lord]
Asano committed seppuku.
Oishi died on March 14th.
He's dead?
Everything he has done has been in pursuit of a single goal.
For you see...
...despite all the women and sake, his eyes and bearing were clear and pure.
He was horrifyingly beautiful.
Rui, you've shown great perception.
- I'll take my leave now!
- No, you won't!
If there are others who share Oishi's goal...
...I imagine they have the same eyes and demeanor.
Rui, tomorrow I want you to go and stay at Lord Kira's estate.
Me, go to Lord Kira's?
You're the only one who could expose any Ako spies who might be there.
Please... don't make me do it!
Come in.
Kanzaki!
Maebara!
I'm glad you made it here safely!
You amaze me, opening a shop right under Kira's nose.
But I'm also very impressed with
Okano's work as chief clerk!
Oishi's group is the only one yet to arrive, and I think they'll be here soon.
Come on.
- How could you not see him?!
- Sir, I haven't done anything!
- Sir, he's my friend...
- Shut up! Where were you born?
Edo, sir. Edo!
Don't lie to me!
- You bastard!
- Why, you!
Something's going on out front.
- It's a nighttime noodle vendor.
- I'll go take a look!
Hey, what are you doing?!
Oh, I'm sorry.
Please, wait! Sirs, this man is like a little brother to me. Please, spare him.
Now apologize to these men!
Who the hell are you?!
I own a trinket shop right across from here.
My name is Gohei.
Please, forgive us. Please!
Are you saying you'll vouch for him, trinket man?
Yes, yes.
If he's not who you say he is, I'll have you evicted!
I promise you, he is.
All right, scram.
Thank you! We're so sorry.
I'm sorry.
I want to somehow get my hands on up-to-date plans of the estate.
Thank goodness. Sugino almost got dragged into Kira's mansion!
Sugino's posing as a nighttime noodle vendor.
Oh, I see...
Oh!
Oh!
Sugino!
I saw those bastards beat you...
I'm so glad you made it here safely.
Well, for now why don't you eat some of my noodles?
Good evening.
Oh, welcome!
The teeth of my comb broke.
Hmm, which one should I buy?
Is it for you?
Let's see...
How do you like this one?
I don't want something so childish!
Well then...
Say, Kin, are you all alone tonight?
Yes.
What were you doing just now?
Oh, nothing really.
What were you doing just now?
Kin, do you mean to live here like this forever?
Well, yes, I suppose...
I see.
Well, that makes me happy. After all, that way I can keep seeing you every day!
Err... your comb...
Tell me, Kin, where are you from?
You mean, my hometown?
It's...
It's in the west, isn't it?
Yes... I suppose it is west.
I was right!
I can tell everything about you, Kin.
Everything?
You're honest and hardworking, and you carry a great ambition in your heart.
Am I right? I bet you want to own your own little shop someday...
...instead of working here all by yourself in someone else's.
You do know everything.
See? I really do know you.
He can't stay like that!
What's wrong?
Horibe...
I lecture Okano every time
I see him. You tell him too!
- Kanzaki!
- Okano!
I'm so glad you made it safely!
Hey, Okano. Haven't you gotten the estate plans from Suzu yet?
If we don't get them immediately, it'll be too late.
I know.
The girl is infatuated with you.
If you take advantage of that, we could have those plans.
Horibe, I can't deceive a woman.
But we absolutely must have post-renovation plans of Kira's mansion!
She's crazy about you.
It's a small sacrifice for a great cause.
Look at Oishi!
Think of the suffering he has managed to endure.
But misleading a woman...
...is something I just can't do.
A palanquin is entering
Kira's estate!
Father... I'm glad to see you looking so well.
As I get older, the cold gets to me more and more.
November's come so quickly.
Well, come in.
Okano... when Oishi parted with his family in Yamashina...
...even those of us watching from a distance wept.
Kanzaki...
...trampling on the feelings of an innocent girl in love is more than I...
Please, just drop it.
We believe Oishi is in Edo, My Lord.
Oishi?
Ah...
...the chief councilor of Ako?
Yes.
Oh, there's nothing to fear from a man like that.
Hyobu, make sure our security is tight.
Yes. We already have the most prominent of the Ako ronin under surveillance.
Stop. Why are you so interested in my house?
This is a public road, isn't it?
Maybe, but you've been roaming around since this morning!
What time do you think it is?!
If you want something, come inside!
Come on!
EDO
EDO
This makes 46. Everyone but Yato
Emoshichi has arrived in Edo.
This makes 46. Everyone but Yato
Emoshichi has arrived in Edo.
Your safe arrival has put the men in higher spirits than I could've imagined!
What's the situation in Kira's estate?
Sir... he's apparently made extensive renovations...
...and we still don't know the layout inside the mansion.
And its defenders?
They have master swordsmen from the Uesugi Clan...
...and at least 10 are on duty at all times.
Some of them are famous: Shimizu Ichigaku,
Kobayashi Heihachiro, Waku Handayu...
There was a Kira spy hanging around in front of my house, too.
And it's just like you said last year...
Lady Yozen'in's estate isn't safe either.
Do they know that my father is in Edo?
I doubt that Kira's people have noticed yet...
...but the citizens of Edo have gradually started... to curse the ronin of Ako for cowardice...
...and people like me, whose faces they know, are being called dogs.
How much money do we have?
We've managed to make ends meet, but we're almost broke.
Has there been any discord among you? Has our secret been leaked?
We've all sworn on our lives.
There's absolutely no worry there.
Ultimately, what we absolutely must do before the raid...
...is to get a map of the inside of Kira's estate.
That, and... we must find out what Kira himself looks like.
Not a single one of us has ever seen him!
No, that is not so...
I have seen Kira's face.
You have?
As fate would have it, he was serving the Shogun...
...three years ago when I accompanied our master to Nijo Castle in Kyoto.
I perfectly remember his looks and the eboshi daimon he wore.
Out of the 47 of us, only you know him...
How very curious.
With this many of us in Edo, someone is bound to discover us.
We can't take our time anymore!
Please, let's do it before the end of the year.
Emoshichi journeys here with his mother in tow.
I hope he will arrive in time.
Mother...
I'm so sorry, but I have nothing more to sell.
It was wrong of me to come along.
I should have forced myself to let you go.
Leave me here, and make better time by yourself.
I...
Mother!
You mustn't think of doing it!
What nonsense.
Death is easy.
If I stay with you,
I'll only cause you trouble.
Where are you going?
I still have my sword!
But, Emoshichi!
You... You...
You mean to go unarmed?!
This sword is a memento of your father.
Leave here now while you can.
I'll do whatever I have to from here.
This money should at least feed you for a day.
I'm so sorry.
Mother... please take care.
When I've found a home in Edo...
...I swear I'll come back for you!
Emoshichi...
...I'm so proud of you for keeping your great secret, never telling it even to me.
I know that this is our final goodbye.
Hurry up and go.
Hurry up and go!
Leave!
Y... Yes.
Rui!
Yes?
Today we'll finally find out whether Oishi is in Edo!
What do you mean?
The ronin of Ako...
...are concerned that
Lord Kira might take refuge... at our master's family home of Yonezawa.
But wouldn't Lord Kira need the Shogun's permission to go to Yonezawa?
Of course.
But I planted a rumor to that effect with the merchants who supply Kira's estate.
So you intend to trick the Ako ronin into attacking a fake convoy?
Yes! That's it exactly!
You don't look too pleased.
We have to do this to save our master's house.
Where did this rumor that Kira was going to Yonezawa come from?!
The merchants who regularly sell to him.
What's more, they say he's leaving today!
If this does turn out to be true, today is the last chance we'll get for a long time!
Sir!
If Oishi and the others are in Edo, they're sure to attack the processional.
Yonezawa is too far away.
Councilor, it's a naïve idea.
Even if Oishi is in Edo, he won't walk into such a trap, only to die a dog's death!
You have that high an opinion of Oishi?!
An old man used to luxury...
...wouldn't be eager to go to the snow country.
But I think he might if it were to save his own life.
Hara...
...do even you think that?
Sir! You still say this is a trick of Chisaka's?!
What is it? What happened?
Kira's procession!
Kira's procession has just left the gate!
What will you do?!
Sir!
There's not a moment to lose!
Excuse me!
Wait, all of you!
How can you tell us to wait now?!
Excuse me!
Don't be rash!
I have to know!
Are you right, or am I?
Come on!
That palanquin is empty.
Well?!
It's strange.
Nothing's happened.
Is it Oishi?! Shimizu, follow that man.
If you have to, kill him.
Hey!
- Wait!
- Hold it!
You attack me knowing it's unjust?
It's a swordfight! A swordfight with Lord Kira's men!
It's a swordfight with
Lord Kira's men!
Withdraw! Withdraw!
Stay back!
- Stay back!
- Sir...
There's no question; he means to get revenge.
Avoid letting Lord Kira outside as much as possible. And find the spy!
Yes, sir.
They're insulting! I got mistaken for an
Ako spy at Kira's place the other day...
...and some samurai sent me flying like a rag doll. Now look at me!
Last year everyone said the Ako ronin would get revenge, but nothing's happened.
["Oishi:" Lit., "big rock."]
That Oishi's no big rock, he's a small pebble.
It's a disgrace!
Ako had 53,000-koku.
They must've had lots of samurai, but not one avenges his master! How pathetic!
Yeah, I'm a total stranger and
I could just about do it myself!
I mean, you linger a second outside the guy's gate and they knock you down!
So maybe the ronin of Ako can't get near him, either. But seriously...
...isn't anyone going to avenge him?
Yes!
I don't know about anybody else, but there's one who'll kill Kira!
Oh? Is it Oishi Kuranosuke?
Or his son Chikara?
Or Horibe Yasubei?
But he's just a dog now.
No, no!
So who's the man who's going to get revenge for this bump here?
Katsuta Shinzaemon!
I've never heard of him!
You fools! Katsuta married my daughter! He's my son-in-law!
And where is this son of yours?
In the same row houses as you!
- As me?
- Yeah.
But...
That samurai who looks like a dirty beggar!
Jerk! What do you mean, "beggar"?!
He's so weak-looking!
Just you wait!
I know Katsuta will get revenge!
- What a joke.
- Don't make me laugh!
Personally I agree the Uesugi Clan should take Lord Kira in...
...but we'll have to wait for a good opportunity.
May I ask your reason, My Lord?
I don't know who put it into his head, but at my audience with the
Shogun the other day...
...he said that ordering Takumi no Kami to commit seppuku...
...and taking his 53,000-koku was a rash decision.
He asked me how the ronin of
Ako were doing, and the like.
In the end, he even admonished me.
What did he say?
He told me not to act on my own in his name.
Could Okado Denpachiro have prodded the Inspector General and the Elders...
...into bending the Shogun's ear?
Hmm, I would like to see him dismissed...
...but he has depths of strength to him.
At any rate, I can't grant this request right now.
"Current locations of former
Asano vassals"?
What is this?
The magistrate's office requested that information about the Ako ronin.
Throw it away.
But...!
I said, throw it away!
How are we supposed to "keep them in line" when they aren't making any trouble?
Chisaka probably put this through by cozying up to the magistrates.
This will be our last meeting until the day we strike.
When will we make our raid?
Within the next 10 days.
When we've made sure
Kira will be at home.
Once the date is set,
I'll visit you and let you know.
Until then, those without duties to perform must not go outside.
This is the critical moment that will determine whether we succeed or fail.
All of us must protect this secret with our lives.
Emoshichi didn't make it, after all.
Emoshichi!
Everyone, I beg to be forgiven for being late.
Emoshichi, thank goodness you're here!
We'll strike within 10 days.
Where have you come from?
I rushed straight here from an inn in Kanagawa.
Where is your mother?
We couldn't pay for the room, so I left my mother at the inn in Kanagawa, as their hostage.
Emoshichi...
...I will make sure you see your mother before the raid.
We've already said our goodbyes.
My mother has resigned herself to this.
Please, don't worry about us.
Okano...
This is a memento of my mother.
Will you deliver it to Emoshichi's mother for me?
Sir...
...I swear to you that I will obtain a plan of the mansion.
What is it you wanted to talk to me about?
Come on, tell me quickly.
Yes... I'll tell you now.
Suzu...
There's something I want of you.
What is it?
I'll give you anything.
Come, what is it?
Suzu...
I'd like you to show me the plans to Kira's estate.
What?
I just want to look at them.
Then I'll give them right back.
The plans...?
I beg you, please.
You want them that much?
- You can't mean to...
- Suzu...
What's your answer?
Will you... Will you help me?
Or not?
Kin...
There's something
I'd like to ask you first.
- What is it?
- Kin...
Do you love me... even a little?
Or are you just using me to get the plans?
Th... That's...
Which? Please, tell me.
Which is it?
I love you. You're the one
I love best in this world.
Truly? You mean it?
If I didn't love you, I wouldn't have suffered so much.
I love you too, Suzu.
That's exactly... why I'm so...
Don't say any more.
That's enough...
...to make me happy.
I have what I've always wanted...
Kin!
Oh my. Father, I thought you were asleep upstairs.
What did you take from the cabinet?
Money.
Liar! You've never wanted for money. Show me!
No! No!
I'm begging you, please just let me go!
Show me. Hand it over!
It's nothing. Go upstairs and keep out of this.
Yessir.
If you eavesdrop, you'll pay for it!
Forgive me!
Suzu... do you know the truth about him?
Do you know who he is?
Yes.
And did he tell you his name?
No.
Hurry, go!
Thank you, my love.
In my heart, you're my wife.
That's the truth, isn't it, Kin?
But...
...this is goodbye forever.
At least... At least tell me your real name.
It's...
Suzu! Don't ask him needless questions!
Masagoro, sir...
I do regular business with Lord Kira.
Kin, I don't give a damn about your worldly name.
I know the two of you can't be together.
But you'd better marry her once and for all in the next life!
Please.
I will, sir.
You swear it?
Yes.
Thank you. Now go, before anyone sees you.
Yes, sir.
Suzu...
Kin!
Kin...
In the next life...
In the next life, I swear it.
Yes!
Father!
Halt!
What are you wandering around for?
Hello. I'm on my way to visit a friend.
I mean no harm, sir.
Lies!
You're no ordinary townsman.
You're wrong, sir.
I work in a trinket shop...
Show me what you have there.
What do you mean, sir?
I don't have anything.
You see?
No more lies!
Hey!
I think you're an Ako spy!
Why would you say that?
I'm nothing of the sort!
Silence! Rui...
Rui! Are you running away?!
No, sir, I promise you there's nothing to be suspicious of.
Hmm? Confess!
But there's nothing to confess...
I really don't know anything.
- Show me what you're hiding!
- I don't...
What is it?
You still won't tell me?!
Please... Please let me go.
- Stand up.
- Okay.
- Stand up!
- All right.
Sir Shimizu!
Sir Shimizu!
What? This is men's business.
Step aside.
But Kin is my husband-to-be! Please don't mistake him for someone else.
- He's your man?
- Yes.
Don't you dare loiter around here!
Kin...
My darling...
...thank you.
No... you've endured so much.
Do you know the tea ceremony?
Only a little...
How about haiku poetry?
I regret to say not.
Will you come on the 14th?
It'll be quite the crowd. Well?
Yes.
I'm afraid I must attend to some personal business...
...so I will take my leave.
This gives us the strength of a thousand men!
Well done, Okano.
How did you come by that wound?
It's nothing.
You did your duty.
I'm sure Suzu will understand.
What are you talking about?
Suzu is my wife.
It's only natural for a wife to be of service to her husband.
As I arranged your marriage, here is my wedding gift.
Open up!
Get in!
Do you still refuse to talk, you Ako spy?!
I don't know what you're talking about, sir!
How about now?!
I don't know!
I don't know anything!
Then why were you hanging around the gate?!
Confess!
Why you!
Take that!
Why, you!
Take that!
Hurry up and talk!
Confess, you swine!
Well?! Take this, you stubborn bastard!
You got it wrong!
What are you doing?!
I'm ill!
Hey, this guy was at the gate the other day.
These people are innocent.
Why treat them so cruelly?
Yamaoka's been murdered.
He and I were friends since childhood.
I'll have my revenge upon those Ako scum!
But Sir Yamaoka was...
Fortunately, we've discovered where Oishi's staying.
After he returns, you will bring him out to me.
Mr. Kakimi, sir, you have a visitor.
Well, now...
Rui.
It's been a long time.
And what can I do for
Chisaka today?
He asked me to confirm that you're here...
...and obtain proof that you plan to attack.
You hid a dagger... behind your back that day, didn't you?
And today it is you... who is hiding something behind your back.
And will you stop at nothing to find out what it is?
You and the other ronin risked your lives to come here.
The beauty of that act has cut me to the core.
You look so noble.
And the actions of Lord Uesugi and Lord Kira are so ugly!
How long will they continue?
And I participated in them.
After witnessing your nobility...
...I can't bear to be their dog anymore!
That which you hid from me, your belongings, and your life are all in danger here.
Lord Kira must stay in Edo until the end of the year.
On the 14th, he'll hold a tea ceremony, and everyone in the estate will feast.
Rui...
...are you trying to get yourself killed?
No...
...if I wanted to die,
I would attack you...
...and die by your sword.
Say... what have you done with that ball?
- I threw it away.
- You threw it away?
I pray that you will achieve your goal.
You're a ronin from Ako.
Going to visit Oishi?
What? No, you have the wrong man.
Silence!
Hold it!
Please, stop!
Rui! Rui!
Did you see a woman out front when you came in?
A woman I didn't know was just cut down by Shimizu while trying to protect me.
What?!
Sir! It's true, there will be a tea ceremony at Kira's mansion on the 14th.
Rui! Rui! Rui!
Rui...
Rui...
Thank you.
Damn that Oishi...
I looked... everywhere...
Oishi wasn't there.
He'd just...
...just left...
...the inn...
Rui!
We'll strike on the 14th.
THE 14TH
Hello! Sugi!
Sugi!
Oh, Genzo!
Hey! Where are you going?
Hey, wait!
Do we have a guest, Sugi?
Yes. It's Genzo.
Goodness! Genzo?
Yes. He says if the Master is out, he'd like to speak to you.
Honestly, how could my husband have such a drunken lout for a brother?
What should I tell him?
Let's see...
Say this awful snow has my stomach pains acting up, and I'm sick in bed.
But what if he wants to pay you a get-well visit?
Hmm...
Tell me, what should we do?
Well, I'm going to sleep, so lay out a futon for me, quick as you can.
All right.
- Sugi! Sugi!
- Yes?
Also, tell him my husband will be out late...
...on business, and probably won't be back until after nightfall.
Then chase him away, quick!
- Yes, My Lady.
The Mistress is sick in bed. This awful snow has given her the usual trouble.
There you go, lying.
Well, if you think I'm lying, go and check on her yourself!
No, never mind. Just tell her to take care of herself in this cold weather.
Fortunately, I have some medicine.
Give this to her for me.
What, your personal medicine box too?
Yes.
All right.
What is it?
Well, I'm told that the Master is out on business...
...and won't return until this evening.
What? This evening?
Yes.
That's no good.
Sugi, put those clothes in front of the alcove.
Oh, are you going to wear it?
No. I just have to do something.
Like this?
Yes. Take this.
And do what?
Put it there.
Now leave me for a while.
Well, please don't put it on.
Well, Brother, I was adopted into the Akagaki at a young age...
...and I have never forgotten for an instant the kindness... you've shown me ever since.
I've come today to say my farewells, but unfortunately you are not here.
I leave dejected.
After you've lived out a long life, and I see you in the next world...
...I plan to give you my thanks for all you've done for me.
My! Genzo, are you crying?
Huh...? Of course not!
The cold just made my eyes water.
Oh, you're never serious! But are you going somewhere far away?
Yes, I suppose I am.
- When will you be back?
- A good question.
Next July will be the first Bon
Festival after my departure,
...so I will definitely be back for that.
It's bad luck to say that!
You're talking like you're already a ghost.
A ghost, eh?
Well, when the time comes, I hate dumplings and bean-paste buns...
...so leave me sake for an offering, okay?
I owe you a lot, don't I?
Hurry up and find yourself a good husband.
Mind your own business.
But I guess no one would take you, huh?
Hmph!
Is he gone?
Yes. He left this medicine for your stomach cramps.
What?
He gave it to me, along with his own pill case.
He seemed very different than usual... very lonely.
Why... Kuranosuke!
I've been waiting for so long.
Ever since I heard you were in Edo...
...each day I've wondered,
"Is this the day I'll see him?"
I've... I've waited so fervently for this day!
I do not deserve such great consideration, My Lady.
You seem so weary... somehow.
Kuranosuke, you've visited us in the midst of a great snowstorm.
Can it finally be that...
Lady Toda.
I've come because I'm about to travel somewhere far away...
...and I thought I wouldn't have another chance to visit.
Where is this faraway place?
You see...
...a certain western Daimyo is taking me into his service, so I came to say my farewells.
What? Another Daimyo?
Kuranosuke, is this true?
Why do you ask?
Now that Lord Daigaku has been denied his inheritance...
...you would go serve another
Master, in another house...
...without the slightest thought of vengeance for our dead Lord?
I want to know how you can do such a thing!
- Kuranosuke.
- Yes?
You are the only one in all the world upon whom I can rely.
I beg you, be candid with me.
My Lady, there is nothing I haven't been candid about.
The day of Takumi no Kami's seppuku, the only message he gave to Kataoka was for you.
I know you can never forget it!
Do you say you have no intention of answering the call to revenge...
...that echoes from the dagger he sent you, the one that took his life?
None?
None?
None, then?!
None whatsoever.
Then, there's nothing more to be said.
But, when I think of how deeply Takumi no Kami trusted you, it breaks my heart!
This is goodbye.
I hope you will take care of yourself in this cold weather.
Give it to him.
Kuranosuke, my Lady remembered how easily you get cold...
...and she sewed this silk headscarf herself, to give to you if you came.
Kuranosuke, the two of us are alone now. Please, tell me the truth.
Lady Toda, I have already told you the truth.
Now, I'll take my leave.
Oh, Lady Yozen'in's anger made this completely slip my mind.
These are the travel poems I wrote on my journey to Edo.
After Lady Yozen'in's anger has abated, please read them to her.
You insist you will not take revenge, then?
Excuse me.
Lady Toda.
You cannot be too careful these day. Please, take care...
...to lock the doors tightly, blow out all the candles, and so forth.
Goodbye.
Sugi says Genzo came while I was out.
Ah... yes.
You must have seen him.
How did he look?
Was he well?
Unfortunately,
I had a stomachache...
Oh?
Well, it's not your fault you were sick.
- Sugi!
- Yes?
Why is this here?
Sir...
...Genzo said he was going someplace far away...
...so he wanted to say farewell to you, and then he left that sake...
What? He came to say goodbye?
And left sake here?
And was he acting oddly at all?
Yes. He... well, it seemed like he was crying.
Crying?
Then when I asked if he was crying, he said the cold made his eyes water.
It was strange, somehow.
Genzo cried?
What day is it today?
Well, it's the 14th...
Why on Earth didn't you receive him?!
Father, Katsuta is here.
Shinza is here? Well, does he still look poor and scruffy?
He's very well-dressed.
So he's come to say goodbye?
And? Did he mention revenge?
No. He said he'd been taken into Lord Sendai's service.
What? Lord Sendai?!
Father, I pray for your good health.
I'm told you've been taken into Lord
Sendai's service. Is it true?
Yes.
I'll come bring Yae to our new home when things have settled down...
...but today I came to bid you my leave.
Shut up!
Did you think the sight of those fine clothes...
...would make me happy?
I have no use for a samurai who forgets his duty to his Lord...
...refuses to avenge him, and now serves two masters!
A... As of today...
...you are no longer my son!
Oh, Father!
How could you?!
Leave! Get out!
I have no choice.
Darling!
This money is to buy what you need for the journey.
But it's so much!
I'm traveling to Sendai ahead of you.
You never know what could happen.
Darling, please at least see your child!
Yae! Stay away from that disloyal samurai! That coward!
Look, baby, it's your father.
Please don't worry about what my father said.
Yae, take good care of our son.
You're acting differently today.
What is it?
Kobai! What are you doing?!
Intruder!
Intruder! Intruder!
Intruder! Stop her!
It's Kobai, the new servant!
Forty-seven orders, all ready!
Food for forty-seven, all ready!
"We hereby swear to abide by all of these provisions."
"And, should we, by unhappy chance, fail to kill Lord Kira...
"...we shall set fire to the estate and each man shall disembowel himself."
My Lady!
It's a vengeance pact!
How foolish I've been! How could I not have noticed...
...Kuranosuke's inner anguish, his painstaking caution?!
And in truth, it's thanks to Kuranosuke that we were able to deal with Kobai.
Oh, what should I do?
Kuranosuke! Kuranosuke!
Forgive me!
Men, time to go!
Go!
Those are Yamaga-school war drums!
The ronin of Ako are assaulting us!
Men, attack! Attack them!
Asano's vassals are paying a visit!
We are after Kozuke no Suke and no one else!
["The Statement of the Vassals of Asano Takumi no Kami"]
Asano's vassals are paying a visit! We are after Kozuke no Suke and no one else!
Those who resist us will be slain, and those who run, spared!
Women and children, flee!
Only the women and children can leave! Men, stay here!
You bastard!
Father, are you hurt?
Oh my faithless son, I was just toying with him! Get going, you idiot!
My apologies!
Idiot!
Idiot! Just leave!
Sorry!
Find Kira.
So it was you.
I, Okano Kin'emon, will fight you!
Hey! Still no sign of Kira?!
We can't find him!
He ran away!
- Where's Kira?
- I don't see him anywhere!
- You still can't find him?!
- Not yet!
Still no sign of him?!
I have no idea where he's hiding!
Still nothing?!
Lord Kira!
I, Oishi Kuranosuke, have come here with 46 other men...
...in order to avenge
Takumi no Kami.
Now, end your life.
Coward! Goodbye, then!
Big news!
Big news!
Big news, big news! Listen up!
Hey, what happened?
The ronin of Ako!
They did it! They finally did it!
Last night...! They raided Kira's mansion and took his head.
Hey!
Ow ow ow!
Was Katsuta one of them?
Was my son Shinzaemon there or not?!
Answer me, dammit!
Ow! My ears!
You'll rip off my ears!
I don't care about your ears!
Tell me, was he there?!
- Sir! Put this on!
- No one knows yet!
Hey! Was Shinzaemon there or not?!
I don't know!
You fool!
Ouch! Sir, calm down!
Ladies and gentlemen! Behold this rare record of an amazing event!
Over 40 Ako ronin from Banshu raided Kira's mansion...
...and successfully slew their enemy!
Hey! Hey! Show me that list!
That's a limited edition!
Please make it quick!
I know, I know! If I see a name
I like, I'll buy every last copy!
Hey! This ink is so light,
I can't read it!
No, sir, you've got it face-down.
Wait, wait, stay calm. Let's see...
"Oishi Kuranosuke..."
Yes, that's Oishi for you.
Bravo! I'm humbled, sir!
Is your son there, sir?
Get back! "Oishi Chikara,
Yoshida Chuzaemon...
"...Horibe Yahei Kanemaru,
Horibe Yasubei Taketsune..."
Isn't he there?
Shut up! "Otaka Gengo,
Takebayashi Tadashichi...
"...Okano Kinzaemon, Kataoka
Gengoemon, Sugino Juheiji...
He's not there, sir!
"...Maebara Isuke, Kanzaki Yogoro...
"K... K... Katsuta Shinzaemon."
He's here...
He's here.
He's here... He's here!
He's on the list!
Sir! Sir!
We've lost.
Stop! Where are you going?
To kill the Ako ronin!
Wait! You must not!
You must not!
We'd just go the way of the Asano Clan.
Dear, you'll catch your death of cold! Sugi, Sugi!
Yes?
I know my brother was one of the
Ako warriors. Go and find out!
But Master, what if he isn't?
A man knows his own brother!
Go! Go!
All right!
Sugi.
Yes?
When you see him...
...you yell as loud as you can...
... "That boozer Genzo is with them!"
Yes, sir.
Yae! Yae!
Yes?
K... K... K... K...
Katsuta was there.
Sh... Shinza's name is on the list!
Congratulations.
Congratulations!
Genzo!
Sugi?
Sugi...
Give my best to my brother.
Darling!
Suzu, be glad.
Because of your help, I've well and truly avenged my Lord.
This is from Oishi.
All right.
Live a long life.
I'll be praying for your happiness from the other world.
Who goes there?
Don't you know you're near the Palace?
What strange breed of men are you...
...that you presume to enter here, wearing such grotesque clothes, and marching in formation?
None of you shall cross this bridge!
What nerve!
March right over them!
Wait, stop.
Wait! Wait.
Oh... Sir Oishi!
And there's Okano.
Bravo! It must have been satisfying to release such pent-up rage!
Last night, we descended on our sworn enemy's estate...
...and achieved our long- cherished goal.
Now we withdraw to our Lord's ancestral temple of Takanawa Sendaiji.
As one warrior to another,
I beg you will cede us the bridge.
As a man I would. However...
...Ryogoku Bridge is a critical path to the main gate of Edo Palace...
...and crossing it while armed is forbidden.
But if you went to Fukagawa and crossed the bridge at Eitai...
...to get there through Shiba-Takanawa, no one would impede you.
Thank you for your kind words.
Please excuse us, then.
Turn around, men!
THE END
Wait!
- Take a look at this.
- What is it?
We found it ten foot from the entrance.
Looks like a badge of some sort.
It is. And I think it proves that we're on the right track at last.
I hope so, for John's sake.
Let's go and talk to him.
Steve, John must get his leg properly set.
He's your son.
You must send him back to base.
That's for him to decide.
I'll abide by what he says.
- Hello, Father.
- We've got something, Son.
- Where exactly was this found?
- Ten foot from the entrance.
It's the badge of the Karnak guards.
- It could be.
- But it is, man, you know it is.
Look at the hieroglyphic on the reverse there.
Yes, I believe it is!
- Have you seen this, Uncle Joe?
- Yes, I've seen it.
Any idea of the length of the gallery?
Hard to say, five foot, possibly ten?
We should break through in four or five days, then.
- Uh-huh.
- What about your leg, John?
- What about it?
- Well, I don't know much about medicine, but I do know that if that leg isn't set properly now, it will knit the way it is.
It's your decision, Son.
Five days isn't long to wait.
It's a damn sight too long.
Joseph, you're not an archaeologist, but you know better than anyone else what's been put into this search.
For 20 years, I've been trying to discover the tomb of Ananka.
We know that she set out on a pilgrimage to Amtak.
We know that she disappeared with all her party.
We've discovered a concealed tomb in the rock face out there, and we now have evidence that one of her soldiers had access to it.
He might even have been part of the burial party.
Think, man, in five days, we might be looking at Ananka herself.
Or we might be looking at an empty hole in the ground.
 Joseph!
I promised to abide by John's decision.
You're his father, you could have ordered him there.
That boy's going to have a twisted leg for the rest of his life and it'll be your fault.
Well, this is it.
Pity poor old John couldn't come in with us.
I promised to let him know what we'd find.
Glad you stayed, Joseph?
I'll tell you that when I see how John's leg heals.
Oh, it'll be all right, man.
You haven't heard him complaining, have you?
That's because he's as pig-headed as you are.
He's my son.
- Are you ready?
- Ready.
Mr Banning?
I'm Banning.
I must ask you to stop these operations.
I don't understand.
You must not continue digging here.
Why on earth not? We've got all the necessary permits, haven't we, Joseph?
I'm not interested in permits.
- You're not from the Egyptian government?
- No, I'm not.
Oh. There's no more to be said.
Mr Banning, please?
Allow me to appeal to your reason.
Believe me when I say that what you are doing places yourself and the rest of your party in the gravest danger.
If you persist in continuing with this operation,
I cannot answer for the consequences.
Nobody's asking you to, sir.
And now if you'll excuse me...
Mr Banning!
You would do well to remember the ancient saying,
He who robs the graves of Egypt dies.
Now, for the last time, please stop what you're doing and leave this place.
And for the last time, kindly mind your own business.
Come on, Joseph.
Superb.
- Is it?
- Yeah.
It's the royal seal of Ananka.
Now then, hold your breath, Joseph.
Marvellous.
Absolutely undisturbed.
Is it really Ananka?
It must be.
"Ananka.
"Lady of the two kingdoms.
"High priestess of the great god Karnak."
It is, Joseph.
- I'll tell John.
- Huh?
Stephen, I'll tell John.
Yes, do that.
Is it the tomb, effendi?
Yes, the tomb of Ananka.
It's the Scroll of Life.
Is he quite sure? There's no doubt?
No doubt at all.
After all these years.
Confound this leg.
You'd better get back, he'll need help.
Let him have his moment of triumph.
Steve, what is it? What's happened?
Was that the last?
Hmm?
- What did you say?
- Was that the last?
Yes, yes, that was all of it.
- Isobel?
- Mmm-hmm.
- How is she?
- She's fine.
What did she say about your father?
She went to see him again.
Still the same.
Doctors think it's permanent.
How can they say that?
When Father first went into the nursing home, they said if there was no improvement in six months, there never would be.
They may be wrong, you know.
They know very little about mental illness.
- All is ready, effendi.
- OK.
You want to see the inside of the tomb for the last time?
The sooner you seal it up again, the happier I shall be.
Yes, I feel the same way.
I've worked in dozens of tombs.
Seems the best part of my life's been spent amongst the dead.
But I've never worked in a place that had such an aura of menace.
There's something evil in there,
Uncle Joe. I felt it.
Oh, well, let's get it over.
I've placed a charge 12 feet along the tunnel. It'll bring the roof down.
Great god Karnak, father of all living things, hear these words from me, the humblest of your servants.
For this desecration, you will be avenged.
Those unbelievers who disturb the rest of your handmaiden, the princess Ananka, shall suffer for their blasphemy.
Though it takes me years of earthly time,
I shall re-enter the tomb and find the instrument of your revenge, as ordained by your servants
4,000 years ago.
This I swear.
Yes, completely unexpected.
It happened this morning, when they went to wake him.
He asked for you straight away.
But for three years, he hasn't even acknowledged that he has a son.
Now he starts asking for me.
How do you explain it, Doctor?
Frankly, at the moment, I can't.
I had thought that his condition was permanent.
As you know, I believe that he suffered a physical stroke to the brain.
Should be incurable.
Could this mean that he's going to get better?
I don't know, Mrs Banning.
His condition could be purely temporary.
- May I see him?
- Of course.
I would suggest alone.
- I'll wait for you here.
- All right.
Oh, James, show Mr Banning to his father, please.
- Yes, sir. Right this way, sir.
- Thank you.
Hello, Father.
John?
You must excuse me, I...
I've been unwell, you understand.
My memory...
- You look well, Son.
- I am well, thanks.
Your leg, what's the matter with it?
Oh, I... I damaged it three years ago.
It didn't mend very well.
Oh.
You should have seen a doctor and had it set.
You wanted to see me, Father?
Oh, yes.
The mummy.
I wanted to tell you about the mummy.
- The mummy?
- From Ananka's tomb.
Oh, she's in the British Museum.
Not the princess, not her.
It was the mummy who lives.
I'm afraid I don't...
I don't understand.
The mummy I brought to life when I read the scroll.
There was no other mummy.
Don't talk rubbish, man, I was there,
I saw it myself.
It came from the rock when I read the scroll.
- What scroll?
- The Scroll of Life.
After 4,000 years, the words of the scroll brought him to life again.
It hates us, John.
It hates us for desecrating the tomb of its princess.
- It will kill us! It will kill us, all of us!
- Father...
Father, you mustn't upset yourself.
Stop thinking about it.
Nothing really happened that day, you know.
You're a fool, John.
Thank you for coming.
Goodbye, Father.
Remember, John...
Someone has found the scroll.
The mummy is released again.
As I was saying...
I says to him,
"If you think I'm going to cart goods which I don't know nothing about,
"then you've got another thing coming your way, mister," I says.
- So he says?
- So he says,
"It don't make no difference what you're carting, so long as you get paid for it".
So you says?
To which I was forced to agree, times being what they are.
But he didn't tell you what was in it?
Oh, something about relics. Aye, relics.
- All the way from Egypt.
- Relics?
Why send all the way to Egypt for them?
You've got them right here in Englefield.
Well, these come from Egypt.
- Well, I don't like the look of him.
- Who?
The cove we're doing the carting for.
He's a foreigner.
Well, he can't help that, poor chap.
Come on, drink up.
We've got to get going.
- Good night, Bill.
- Good night.
- I'll drive.
- I'll drive, you're drunk.
It's my cart, my horse and I'll drive.
What a dear old horse.
A man's best friend is a horse.
It's a dog.
It's a horse. I'm not that drunk.
- And I'll drive.
- All right, you drive...
Whoa!
Do you think we'd better tie that down?
- What for?
- The road is bumpy.
Aw, just past the nursing home, he said.
It's only half a mile.
- Right.
- Giddyup!
The mummy.
It's waiting.
It's always there.
Help! Help! Help!
- That's from the nuthouse.
- Perhaps one of them got out.
The box isn't half moving about.
You'd better slow down over the causeway.
I'm not going to have my throat cut by no lunatic.
Not for all the relics in Egypt.
Take care, Jim. You'll have me in too if you're not careful.
Oh, it's hopeless.
Parts of this bog are next to bottomless.
We'll never find it.
Now, for some particulars, if you don't mind.
First, what was on the cart?
A great, ruddy box. We was taking it to the house up the ways there.
- And what was in the box?
- I don't know.
But whatever it was, I reckon it's better at the bottom of the bog.
Why do you say that?
It's my idea there was something in that box which wasn't quite right.
I see. Now, where do you say you was taking the box?
Up the ways there.
A big house, set back, he said.
- Who said?
- I said, Officer.
Oh. Morning, sir.
You was expecting this box?
Yes, I was.
I engaged this man and his companion to transport it from the station.
I see. Well, hard luck, isn't it?
I mean, losing it like this.
Is it quite irrecoverable?
Oh, yes, sir. Quite.
I see. Thank you, Officer.
One moment, sir, if you don't mind.
The contents of the box?
Relics, Officer.
Egyptian relics. Nothing more.
I'm very sorry, Mr Banning.
I simply cannot explain it.
First, we have this recovery after three years, and now this.
I've never known him so violent.
He seems to have a persecution mania.
He... He thinks there's somebody who wants to kill him.
- When did it start?
- Yesterday evening.
There's... There's nothing
I can do I suppose.
Nothing whatever, I'm afraid.
We have him in a padded cell for his own safety.
Is that really necessary?
We cannot possibly afford to take any chances.
He may do himself a serious injury.
You see, with this persecution complex, he's quite liable to take his own life in order to cheat whoever he thinks is after him.
It's quite common.
But what could have put him in this state of mind?
As far as I know, he hasn't an enemy in the world.
Great Karnak, god of all light and darkness, hear this prayer from the humblest of your servants.
Help me in my task.
Make my way easy, that I may achieve your desires and return to the land of my forebears.
"Return, O Ka, the double.
O Ba, the soul.
"Pulse strong, O Ab, the heart.
"Make supple the limbs and strong the sinews.
"Refill, oh, my soul, this heart with tenderness that he may walk the Land of Khem,
"in all thy strength and beauty,
"and wear once more the Urolith."
O Karnak, through me, guide this, thy servant, on his appointed task.
Go now.
Go and destroy those who desecrated the tomb of our princess.
Those unbelievers who gazed upon her long-dead face.
Go.
And let the spirit of Karnak, our god, go with you.
Now, If you want anything in the night, just ring this bell.
It's no good shouting or banging on the door. We won't hear you.
All right now?
Good night, Mr Banning.
Help! Help! Help!
Help!
Help!
The very nature of this deed points to the fact that it was committed by some homicidal maniac.
And if it were not for the evidence of forced entry,
I would have no hesitation in telling the doctor of the nursing home to look among his own inmates.
However, there is no doubt that the perpetrator of this crime came from outside the nursing home and left the premises immediately after the crime.
I can only exhort the police to do everything in their power to apprehend this individual with the utmost dispatch.
The verdict of this court is murder by person or persons unknown.
"Person or persons unknown."
- Coroner said it was the work of a maniac.
- I can't believe that.
There must be a motive somewhere.
We must go through his papers.
Perhaps we'll find something there.
He was in the nursing home for three years.
And before that, 10 years in Egypt.
Then, we'll have plenty to work on.
Father kept a record of everything.
I still don't know exactly what we're looking for.
I don't really know myself. A letter, a note. Anything that may give us a lead.
But, Uncle, you knew Father pretty well.
Did he ever mention anyone to you who bore him a grudge or he disliked?
I never remember your father saying a harsh word about anyone ever.
- Except that Egyptian fellow that time.
- What Egyptian?
You remember I told you.
The day we entered Ananka's tomb.
- The man who tried to stop us.
- Yes, yes, I remember.
That sort of thing was always happening.
"Dear Mr Banning, unless this account is settled..."
So much debt.
He was such a methodical man in everything else, but he would leave paying bills to the last minute.
He was always being sued.
If you could remember the argument you had when you decided to take him in hand?
He said he was perfectly capable of dealing with his own business affairs.
And two minutes later, there was a little man on the doorstep serving a writ.
We had a good laugh about it afterwards.
You were very fond of your father, weren't you?
Yes. Yes, I was.
In spite of that leg.
That was my own fault. I could have gone back to base and had it set.
Then all the trouble started.
Do you remember that day?
I don't think I shall ever forget it.
That look on your father's face when he realised he'd discovered Ananka's tomb.
And then afterwards.
It was... It was never really established what made him crack, was it?
- Overwork and the excitement.
- That was the doctor's verdict.
That's what it was.
What else could it have been?
I can't get out of my mind what Father said to me the other day when I went to see him.
All that nonsense about the living mummy and the Scroll of Life?
- Mmm-hmm.
- You'd better, otherwise you'll be having a breakdown too.
- What's that?
- The Ananka folio.
- Do you know the legend?
- Vaguely, yes. What about it?
- Do you know it?
- No, I don't really.
Some wild story about the living dead.
That sort of thing, wasn't it?
And here it is.
"In the year 2000 BC,
"the Princess Ananka, high priestess of the temple of Karnak, set out on a pilgrimage.
"She was bound for Amtak, the reputed birthplace of her god.
"The great procession travelled for three months,
"when the princess was stricken with a sickness from which she died.
"The body of the princess lay in state in her own tent,
"while the involved and lengthy mourning ceremonies took place."
I am come unto thee, O Osiris, who art cleansed of all impurities.
Thou goest 'round heaven.
Thou seest Ra.
Thou seest the beings who have knowledge.
Behold, thou art in the Sektet Boat as it goeth 'round the horizon of heaven.
Prosper thou for me.
All the ways unto thee.
Homage to thee, Osiris, thou mighty and beneficent being.
Thou holy god.
Thou prince of eternity.
"Then her body was prepared for embalming
"by the incredible process known only to the ancient Egyptians.
"First, it was anointed with the holy oils."
Hail, Osiris, triumphant.
The goddess Wa hath given thee birth.
And Anubis, who sitteth upon the hill, hath set thee in order and will fasten thee thy swathings.
Thou art more beautiful than a goddess and hath been begotten for transformations more numerous and with a created form more perfect than those of the gods.
"Then the embalmers, with natron and sweet spices
"prepared her for everlasting preservation."
The god, Ta Sekret, hath given unto thee the honours of the divine house which he hath.
Peoples and nations exalt thee.
The majesty of thy terror is in the hearts of men and the dead.
"And thus she lay for 70 days in her bath of natron.
"Custom decreed that after purification,
"the body of the princess should be returned
"to the coastal plains where she had ruled in life.
"But Kharis, high priest, for reasons of his own, chose to ignore custom.
"Here she had died and here she would remain for all time.
"He caused a tomb to be prepared close to the place of death,
"and it was to this tomb that the ceremonial cortege moved to in final procession.
"Centuries of time had laid down the laws governing the order of the procession.
"The Sektet Boat forbearing the spirit of the dead to the afterworld.
"The living god, personification of the recorder of souls.
"Anubis, guardian of the tomb.
"The head of the goddess Hathor.
"Maidens bearing the Ushabti,
"symbols of mythical power and significance.
"The royal mummy itself, the mortal remains of the Princess Ananka.
"Kharis, high priest, the personal representative of his god Karnak,
"nursing within him a terrible secret.
"The tomb had been hewn deep in the side of a mountain.
"It was designed to remain inviolate for all time.
"Although 1,000 miles from her home, the princess was laid to rest
"with the full pomp and circumstance which was her divine right.
"As the high priestess of the god Karnak,
"to have done less would have been committing sacrilege.
"Under the watchful eye of Kharis, the royal mummy was taken
"from its bier by Nubian slaves and was carried into the tomb.
"Behind it walked Kharis.
"And behind him came the casket containing the heart of the princess.
"Much blood was to flow during the succeeding days.
"Many were to die, both for the further glorification of the princess
"and to ensure that the location of the tomb remained a secret.
"The Nubian slaves were put to the sword.
"Their fate was ordained, as was the fate of the six maidens.
"They all died so that their spirits would accompany that of their princess
"into the afterworld."
Hail to thee, child of the god Shu.
The underworld has gained mastery over his diadem.
Like the Hammamet beings, may thou arise, even as Karnak doth arise and fare forth.
Have power over the speech of thy mouth.
"Thus started the final rites.
Rites that continued for six days,
"culminating in the sealing of the tomb.
"That night, Kharis returned to the tomb alone.
"He violated the royal and sacred seal to regain entry.
"In life, the princess had been loved by Kharis. It was a forbidden love,
"the high priestess being bound by all vows to the god Karnak himself.
"But now Ananka was dead.
And the vows were no longer binding.
"Kharis now attempted the ultimate in blasphemy.
"Using the timeless Scroll of Life
"said to have been written by the hand of the god Karnak himself,
"he tried to bring back to life the princess he loved."
O, thou lord of souls.
O, thou lord of the tomb.
Thou mighty one of Amentet.
Let not these limbs be without movement.
Let them not pass away.
And let them not suffer from corruption.
Make supple these limbs and strong these sinews.
Refill, oh, my soul, this heart with tenderness, that she may walk again the land of Khem in all her strength and beauty.
Give life.
Give life when I pronounce the mighty word of power.
Fulfil ye now the will of the lord god Karnak.
"For this dreadful profanity,
"Kharis was sentenced to have his tongue cut from his mouth
"so that the cries he would utter during the fate that awaited him
"should not offend the ears of the gods.
"Death was not for Kharis, nor was life.
"For his sins, he was sentenced to remain for all time
"on guard near the body of his princess.
"He was buried alive in a secret tomb specially prepared for him.
The rest of them never got back to Egypt.
Illness perhaps? Savages? Who knows.
That is the legend of Ananka.
The dictionary defines "legend" as being historical myth.
But don't forget half the story we know is fact.
We know that Ananka died on a pilgrimage and was buried somewhere in the jungle.
We know that no survivors ever returned to Egypt.
Now, if half the story is true, why not the other half?
Because the other half is removed from fact. It's fantasy.
Dad knew all about the legend.
Perhaps having discovered that half of it was true, he let his imagination persuade him that the rest of it could have been.
Is it possible that's what drove him out of his mind?
Possible, yes. He was overexcited, he'd been working too hard.
But remember, John, historical myth.
Treat it as such.
If you don't want the same thing to happen to you.
A fairy story, nothing more.
Help us, your servants, O Karnak, to fulfil the second of our tasks.
Go now.
Destroy the second of the infidels who dared to desecrate the tomb of your princess.
Hey, Bill, give us a whisky.
Make it a large one.
Anything wrong, mate?
- Gamekeeper troubles?
- I wish it was gamekeepers.
I've seen the like tonight that mortal eyes shouldn't look at.
You've been round to Molly Grady's again.
Ten foot tall, he was!
Swathed in bandages, come lumbering through that wood like a great bear.
- Who?
- You mean "what?"
I tell you, it wasn't human.
Oh, I needed that.
Are you sure that's the first one you've had tonight?
Have you been seeing the little people?
If it's little people, it's the biggest little people ever you heard anything about.
I'll have another one of those.
I tell you, something very unpleasant is going to happen here tonight.
Well, John, I'm going to bed.
I think you should too.
We'll do some more in the morning.
Yes, of course.
You must be tired, I'm sorry.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
What I don't understand, Mr Banning, is that if you hit him like you say you did, you must have killed him.
You didn't do that, otherwise there would be a body.
So, I must assume that you missed.
I tell you, Inspector, I hit him, twice at least from here.
- At four yards?
- At four yards.
I see.
All right, let us have your impressions as to who this intruder must have been.
You'd never seen him before?
I told you, Inspector, he was bandaged, there was just a slit for his eyes, the rest of him was covered.
With bandages? Extraordinary.
- And you hit him twice.
- At four yards.
I see.
Well, I've got men out there looking for him now.
That's all we can do at the moment.
You'll let me know if you have any ideas.
- I have one already.
- You have? Why didn't you say so?
You wouldn't believe me.
I don't believe you about hitting him, if that's what you mean.
All right, Inspector.
I believe the intruder was a mummy, a living mummy.
- A mummy. One of those Egyptian things?
- That's right.
I thought they were always dead people.
They usually are.
By rights, this one should be dead too.
- Now, look...
- Inspector, would you sit down, please?
I want to tell you about something that happened three years ago.
Something I'm now convinced happened to my father.
As you know, he was driven out of his mind.
We were excavating a tomb.
The tomb of a princess Ananka, who died 4,000 years ago.
I was out of action at the time. My leg.
Father and Uncle Joseph entered the tomb without me.
Uncle had promised to let me have any news as soon as he could.
"Ananka.
"Lady of the two kingdoms.
"High priestess of the great god Karnak."
It is, Joseph.
- I'll tell John.
- Huh?
Stephen, I'll tell John.
Yes, do that.
It's the Scroll of Life.
"To restore to life.
"O thou lord of souls
"O thou lord of the tomb.
"O mighty one of Amentet.
"Let not these limbs
"be without movement.
"Let them not pass away,
"and let them not suffer from corruption.
"Make supple these limbs
"and strong these sinews.
"Refill, oh, my soul,
"this heart with tenderness,
"that he may walk..."
When my uncle found him,
Father's mind was completely unbalanced.
He never recovered.
I didn't believe the story my father told me.
I... I thought he was... Well...
But I'm beginning to think differently now.
Mr Banning, are you trying to tell me that these two murders were committed by a dead man?
- I knew you wouldn't believe me.
- You're right, I don't.
I find it incredible that you should even imagine such a story.
I deal in facts, Mr Banning.
Cold, hard facts.
The facts tell me that someone broke in here, committed a murder, then got away.
There is no doubt whoever did it killed your father too.
This I consider a fact also.
But that's where the facts run out.
Well, it's my job to dig around until I unearth some more facts.
But facts, Mr Banning, not fantasy straight out of Edgar Allan Poe.
If you've any more ideas, please let me hear them.
They make fascinating listening if nothing else.
There is one more.
I think I'm the next to be killed.
- It was only a little hare, sir.
- Er, thank you, Sergeant.
- It was dead anyway, sir.
- Sit down, would you?
I'm Inspector Mulrooney, criminal investigation from London.
An inspector from...
The squire's gone mad altogether.
- I beg your pardon?
- It was only a little hare, sir.
And you're a...
I'd better explain to you the way it was.
You see, I was out having a bit of a stroll, minding my own business, see, through the woods, and I happened to see this little bunny lying down there.
It was dead, sir. Killed.
In one of them wicked traps.
So I picked it up, sir,
I was going to give it a decent burial...
And what else did you see in the woods?
Nothing, sir. Only a little bunny, it was lying there...
Uh-huh. It's been reported that you rushed into The Red Lion last night saying you'd seen a man in the woods.
Oh, yes, I... I saw him, all right.
Describe him to me, please.
Oh, well, sir, he was horrible, sir.
He was about 10 foot high...
- How high?
- Well... 7'6"?
Yeah, he'd be about that.
About 7'6 ", 7'7".
I had a father once. He was tall.
About seven foot, something like that...
And then?
Well, and then there was all this yelling coming from the nuthouse.
I got scared and whipped up the horses.
Went over the causeway and the box just fell off.
Straight into the swamp.
There wasn't a hope of saving it, not a hope.
Ah, it was nasty business all round.
Very scarifying, it was.
Thank you.
Give him another, will you?
I thought the crate was gone for good.
Well, parts of the bog are next to bottomless, you understand, sir.
- Well, I was going up to see this man...
- Which man?
The one whose crate it was, the Egyptian.
Anyway, I didn't have to.
He arrived on the scene, and, well, I told him straight away...
- How did he take it?
- Well, it's funny, that one, sir.
Here's this crate come thousands of miles from Egypt.
Then to lose it practically on his doorstep.
Well, he didn't seem to mind.
Treated the whole thing casual like.
- And the contents of the box?
- Relics, he said, sir.
- Relics?
- Egyptian relics.
The last task is upon us, O Karnak.
Watch over us as you have watched over me during the past three years.
Watch as you did throughout the long journey from our own land to this strange country of the unbeliever.
Watch while Kharis, the living mummy, your servant, performs this last task, the one that will release him from his eternal bondage.
The destruction of the last member of the party who desecrated the tomb of your high priestess.
Go now, Kharis.
Kill the last unbeliever who disturbed the sleep of your beloved.
John, isn't it time you came to bed?
- What's the matter?
- It's extraordinary.
I never noticed it before, but with your hair like that, you're the image of Ananka.
Am I?
She was considered the most beautiful woman in the world.
Oh, I am flattered.
- Mind you, the world wasn't so big then.
- Oh, don't spoil it for me.
Have you heard anything more from the police?
No, not since this morning.
Why don't they hurry up and do something before there's another murder?
Well, they're doing the best they can,
I suppose.
It's frightening to think of some maniac wandering around loose in the countryside.
Yes. Yes, it is.
Oh, thank you.
You know something, don't you?
It's just an idea.
Have you told it to the police?
I told them, but they didn't believe me.
I can't blame them either.
Won't you tell me?
It's just that I think the... the maniac might come here again.
Here?
Yes, he wants to kill me.
John, what are you saying?
Of course, I may be wrong.
But if I'm not, my only chance of catching him is to sit here and wait.
But you told me the police didn't believe you.
They didn't.
You're going to do this by yourself?
What else can I do?
I won't allow it.
John, this is ridiculous.
What can you do alone against this man?
I have to take a chance.
I'll have my gun, be ready for him.
I won't let you.
If what you think is true, you should get away now.
Or at least ask for police protection.
Darling, I tried to convince the inspector, but he wanted facts. But, Isobel... if you really want to help me, you'll go upstairs to your room and lock the door.
- But I...
- Isobel...
I've never ordered you to do anything before, but I'm doing so now.
Please do as I ask.
Please go, Isobel.
Very well, John.
John, please take care.
I will, darling.
Don't worry.
No!
Darling! Darling!
Are you all right?
He thought your wife here was this Ananka woman, is that it?
You'll admit there's a strong resemblance.
She's been dead for a thousand years.
So has the mummy, a comatose state of living death.
You know, Mr Banning, this morning
I was all for having you certified.
And now?
I've been asking questions all day, trying to get some sort of lead.
What I've come up with helps to confirm what you're saying.
I'm glad you're convinced.
I didn't say that, but it is a theory.
My facts seem to have gone wrong.
Now tell me what you know about this man who is supposed to be an Egyptian.
What man?
The one that's just taken the big house past the nursing home.
- An Egyptian?
- So the locals say.
Though it's my belief they wouldn't know an Egyptian from a Chinese acrobat.
- But what's an Egyptian doing here?
- That's what I asked myself.
Didn't you ask him?
Mr Banning, if he tells me he's over here to grow mushrooms, I'll have to accept it.
And he's not likely to say he's over here to murder a few people.
- Don't you know anything about him?
- Nothing.
I don't even know if he's really Egyptian.
- I could find out.
- No doubt, but you're not going to.
This must tie up.
It's too great a coincidence.
If he's up to something, you'll be placing yourself in danger.
I know, it's your own neck.
But, at the moment, I'm partially responsible for keeping it where it belongs.
It's my duty to warn you not to take any action yet.
All right, Inspector.
It'll take a little time, but I'll find out about him eventually.
- You're going, Inspector?
- I am, but I shan't be far away.
Now remember, Mr Banning, no private police work please.
- Goodnight, Inspector.
- Goodnight.
Great God, we have accomplished what we set out to do.
The three desecrators are now dead.
At last, you have been avenged.
Now, we are free to return to our own country, if that is your desire.
You have done well, Kharis.
You may rest.
Soon we start the long journey home.
Rest, Kharis.
I will call you when it's time.
Go.
Good evening. My name is Banning.
I live a few miles from here.
I'd heard there was a newcomer to this rather lonely district, so I thought I'd pay you a neighbourly call.
This is very courteous of you, Mr Banning.
I hope I haven't called at an inconvenient time.
- Not at all. Do come in.
- Thank you.
My name is Mehemet Akhir.
This way please.
Thank you.
It is so difficult getting to know people in a strange land.
You come from Egypt, don't you?
- Yes, I do.
- I spent many years in your country.
You must know Egypt very well then.
There's still a lot I want to learn.
You're not Banning the archaeologist?
John Banning, junior member.
Of course, you're Stephen Banning's son.
You knew my father?
Only by reputation.
I haven't heard about him lately.
Has he retired?
My father is dead.
I'm sorry. Please accept my sympathy.
May I have your coat?
Won't you sit down?
Thank you.
Well, this is indeed an honour.
To meet someone who has taken part in unearthing so many of the sacred secrets of my country.
Are you interested in archaeology?
Yes, I am.
Academically, that is. Not commercially.
It has often puzzled me about archaeologists.
Has it never occurred to them that by opening the tombs of beings who are sacred, they commit an act of desecration?
If we didn't, the history of your country, indeed a great part of civilisation, would still be unknown.
Nevertheless, those tombs were sealed for all time.
You're an intruder.
You force your way in, you remove the remains of the long dead kings and send them to places like the British Museum, where thousands of people can stare at them.
Does this not trouble you at times?
Your conscience, perhaps?
No, it's my job. But it troubles you?
Why should it trouble me?
I'm a civilised man, Mr Banning.
To me, the dead are the dead. Clay.
Can I offer you some refreshment?
No, thank you.
A cigar, perhaps?
Do you mind if I keep to these?
Not at all.
I'm very sorry to hear about your father.
- When did he die?
- Recently.
- Had he been, uh...
- Thank you.
Ill for some time?
Yes, he had.
But that wasn't the cause of his death.
What was the cause then?
- He was murdered.
- Oh.
It was a great shock to me.
Oh, please forgive my apathy.
In my country, as you know, violence is quite commonplace.
It doesn't leave the same impression as it does in this peaceful, well-ordered community.
The history of your country is steeped in violence.
Indeed, it is.
I remember the opening of Princess Ananka's tomb.
She was high priestess to a pagan god, Karnak.
We have reason to believe that over 100 people were put to death during her funeral rites.
Most probably.
And Karnak wasn't a particularly important deity, a third-rate god.
Not to those who believed in him.
Perhaps not. But their standard of intelligence must have been remarkably low.
Why do you say that?
He was insignificant.
He had nothing to commend him to anyone with the slightest degree of intelligence.
But surely, you're assuming a great deal.
I don't think so.
I made an extensive study of this so-called religion.
It's based upon artificial creeds and beliefs, some of them ludicrous in the extreme.
Did it not occur to you that beneath the superficial you've learnt about, there could be a great and passionate devotion to this God.
It occurred to me, but I dismissed it.
You're intolerant, Mr Banning.
Not intolerant, just practical.
Intolerant.
Because you're unable to experience the greatness of a deity, you dismiss it as of no consequence.
But believe me, to those who worship and serve Karnak, he is all-powerful.
Surely, there can't be people who still have such beliefs?
Now you talk about something of which you know nothing.
You've scratched only the surface and you know nothing.
You assume the right to disturb the everlasting peace of the gods.
You pry and meddle with unclean hands and eyes.
Profanity, blasphemy, religious desecration, all these you are guilty of.
But the powers with which you have meddled do not rest easy.
I think you will not go unpunished.
Punished? By whom?
There are certain things for which civilisation has no answer.
But if you choose to meddle thus, then you must be prepared to face the consequences, whatever they are.
Consequences? That sounds like a threat.
You must excuse me, Mr Banning.
We like to think that our European dress, our liberal education have buried the past.
But, occasionally, one is forced to realise that all this is only veneer.
Thousands of years of traditional belief cannot be dismissed in one generation.
Please, accept my apologies.
Please, I should apologise to you.
After all, I only came here to welcome you.
I'm afraid I got rather carried away.
I mustn't detain you any longer.
You haven't detained me at all.
- May I?
- Please do.
The 20th dynasty, isn't it?
Nineteenth.
Yes, of course. How stupid of me.
Have you any other pieces in this period?
Very few, I'm afraid.
A large consignment was lost in transit,
I'm sorry to say.
How unfortunate. The trouble is these things are irreplaceable.
Quite.
Thank you. Most interesting.
Thank you for calling.
We shall meet again.
- It's a small world. Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
Karnak, great god, your servants have failed you.
The task is not yet accomplished.
But this will be remedied.
Before the sun strokes the horizon, the last desecrator will be dead.
This, I promise.
I have served you faithfully, great god, to the best of my humble ability.
But if it should be that I'm unable to commune with you again, then so be it.
We go now.
Our fate and our destiny we place in your merciful hands.
Come, Kharis.
This time you shall not fail.
If he'd strangled you there and then, it would have served you right.
Inspector, my father and his brother have both been killed. I had to do something.
Anyway, I found out what you wanted.
Are you sure it was him?
I'm certain. Apart from his conversation, he had the seal to Ananka's tomb.
What more do you want, Inspector?
Surely...
I'll tell you, Mrs Banning.
Perhaps your husband is right.
Perhaps this man is controlling the mummy.
I'm inclined to think he is.
But what you don't understand is he's been forced into a position where he has got to act and act soon.
I didn't want to force any action until I was ready to deal with it.
By that time it might have been too late.
Couldn't we get more help?
At the moment, the sergeant is trying to round up some of the villagers.
In the meantime, all I have is PC Blake and another man.
Where are they?
Blake is at the back of the house.
The other man is up the road.
It's loaded.
Now, sir, as you're acting as decoy,
I think it would be safer if Mrs Banning came with me.
- Oh, I don't think so.
- No, don't worry, Mrs Banning.
The man up the road will give us plenty of warning.
It's best.
If anything happens, fire your gun as a signal.
You stay here, Mrs Banning.
I'm going around to the front to check up.
All right.
Inspector Mulrooney!
Stop!
Isobel, your hair!
Stop!
Kill her, Kharis.
Kill her!
Kill her!
What happened?
He's taken Isobel.
- Where do you think he'll take her?
- The house.
Wait, look.
He's taking her to the swamp.
No! Don't risk it.
Don't shoot, you'll hit Mrs Banning.
Now what are we going to do?
Have the men line up here.
Come on, into position.
Isobel! Isobel, this is John.
Isobel! Isobel!
Isobel, tell him to put you down.
Tell him, Isobel, quickly.
Kharis.
Kharis, put me down.
Let's go around the other side.
Tell the men to be ready.
Stand by, men. Be ready.
Put me down. Kharis, put me down.
Isobel, start walking towards me.
Slowly.
When I shout, get down as low as you can.
Now, Isobel. Fire!
Come on, Isobel.
You're safe now.
Since the world began, ever-inventive man has constantly pushed forward into the unknown.
One by one, the frontiers of science have fallen before him, the science of speed, travel, radio.
Now he stands on the threshold of a new age, a terrifying age.
Man goes forward into the unknown.
But how does the unknown react?
The unknown planet,
Planet X.
All righty, Dr. Laird.
Right.
Circuit A.
Circuit A.
Circuit B.
Circuit B.
All right, Gil, put in GF2.
Yes, sir.
Gently.
Gently.
GF2 entered.
Sayers, you fool, get away from there!
- Morning, Wilson.
- Good morning, Brigadier.
- Please sit down.
- Thank you.
I take it you've come about Laird.
Yes. He's got to stop,
Wilson.
That'll be your recommendation to the committee?
Of course.
Don't you agree?
You're thinking of this business of Sayers.
Well, I'm thinking of the cost.
By the way, I've replaced Sayers.
The devil you have.
No alternative while the present setup lasts.
We're committed to two assistants.
Well, the sooner we close the whole project down, the better.
Now, look, Wilson, I am just a plain bone-headed brass hat.
I wouldn't say that, Brigadier.
You would, and you jolly well do, I know.
It's true anyway.
But I do know when an experiment is successful.
And I do know when it's costing the Earth, even though I don't fully understand it.
I don't suppose there are more than half a dozen people who do understand precisely what it is that Laird is trying to achieve.
- Then why on Earth...
- As far as Laird is concerned, his work is pure research.
Pure baloney.
But the practical implications may well affect thinking on defense matters.
That is why we are financially supporting the project.
Financially supporting?
Do you know how much money we've poured down that drain to date?
A quarter of a million pounds.
Can you justify that?
Can Laird?
Justify?
Has anyone ever been able to justify pure research at the time?
Without it, no radio, no television, no radar, no guided missiles.
Is Laird onto something like that?
Laird is engaged on experiments which aim to study the changes, if any, in the nature and properties of metals, living tissues and other materials when introduced into powerful magnetic fields.
I know. I know. I can read.
Right.
If Laird can produce a magnetic field more powerful than any that has been produced before, if he can demonstrate that important changes do occur...
Has he?
He's nearly bumped off Sayers, and he's having trouble with his equipment.
He was on the phone this morning.
- He's asking for more and more.
- More?
Oh, this is preposterous.
I'm going straight down there this morning to get to the bottom of this piece of folly.
That might be a good idea, Brigadier.
Seriously, though, Laird tells me he's already had some limited success.
- You might check on that.
- I certainly will.
Oh...
I promised to send him this.
Perhaps you would take it.
- What is it?
- A piece of metal, an alloy, such as used in aircraft.
What's Laird supposed to do with that?
Tell him if you'd like.
Oh, I'd love to.
In that case, you'd better take this piece, too.
I'd like to think that one experiment at least was some use to the country.
- Is this the same?
- Well, actually, no.
I want testing on both eventually.
- You going straight away?
- Yes, this morning.
Good. We have to soften the old boy up on his new assistant.
- It's a woman.
- A woman?
- Yeah.
- I can hardly wait to tell him.
Well, here we are.
Oh, Gil, this is Brigadier
Cartwright from the Ministry.
- How do you do, sir?
- How do you do?
This is Gil Graham,
Brigadier, my chief assistant.
He's from McGill in Canada.
A fine university.
Thank you, sir.
My other assistant was injured.
We're expecting another one today.
Oh, Lord. I am sorry.
I had forgotten.
I was to tell you your new assistant is a woman.
A woman?
You must be joking.
- Oh, he has to be joking.
- I'm afraid not.
There's no one else available to operate this computer of yours.
But a woman, this is preposterous.
This is highly skilled work.
She's very highly qualified, Doctor.
Yeah, I know the type... frustrated, angular spinster, very dedicated to her calling, without a sense of humor, bossy and infuriatingly right every time.
Sorry. I know how you feel.
I'm not having this.
I'll go up and see Wilson.
Look, Doctor, don't you think you'd better show me what you've brought me down here to see?
Maybe you won't need an assistant soon.
Very well.
Bend this.
This is a piece of copper.
So is this.
Bend it.
But this is flexible like steel.
Precisely.
Dr. Laird,
I'll take these GF2 figures to your office.
This is really most remarkable.
It has had its molecules realigned in there.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I was told to come down here.
Who did you want to see?
Dr. Laird. Are you...
No, no. I'm Gilbert Graham, his assistant.
Oh. I was told to report here.
He's right here in the laboratory.
Oh, uh, are you the new comp operator, the replacement for Sayers?
Yes, I am. I heard about Nicky Sayers.
I'm terribly sorry.
Oh, I don't know.
Weren't you expecting me?
Not exactly.
You're French, aren't you?
Yes, I am.
Are you surprised?
- Very agreeably so.
- Thank you.
I think that Dr. Laird will be, too.
How is he to work with?
Oh, he's great... as long as you stand up to him.
I see.
Oh, Mr. Graham, can I have a word with you?
Certainly.
This is Michele Dupont.
General Cartwright.
How do you do?
How do you do?
As soon as I see her in to Dr. Laird,
I'll meet you up in the office.
Yes.
Excuse me.
Now, this business of altering the molecular structure of metals, has he got any defense angle?
Well, if the molecular structure of the alloys used in building an aircraft were to be altered, the plane would probably crash.
Remember Comet 1?
Oh, yes, yes, of course.
But research of that nature into metal fatigue and all that sort of thing, that's already being carried on elsewhere.
- Well, not quite, sir.
- How do you mean?
Well, our research may lead to the discovery of means to crash an enemy's aircraft.
You aren't suggesting, I take it, the enemy would allow us to cook his airplane alloys in that contraption of yours?
Well, I don't think that'd be necessary.
Let me try to explain.
Magnetism is a force, the only force other than gravity.
They may be one in the same thing that operates over a distance.
I see you have nine circuits in operation here and only one in reserve.
Is that not rather dangerous?
This infernal machine has only 10 circuits, and I need as many surges as I can get.
The thing is supposed to compute and then fire the electrical impulses.
I use a field of high intensity but short duration.
I understand.
Nevertheless,
I think you should have at least three in reserve and one overriding spare, and I mean one not in actual use.
That would give me only six charges, and it isn't enough.
I see you don't understand this machine.
Each circuit is capable of use over and over again.
If it has a few microseconds to clear itself, that means you can have as many surges as you like in banks of three.
Yes.
Yes, of course.
Do you mean that
Laird could produce a magnetic field powerful enough to reach out beyond the machine, beyond the house?
Well, from what the people down in the village are saying, he's done it already, spasmodically.
Is it true?
Do you think so?
I don't know.
Sometimes I wonder.
Look here, Graham, be honest about this.
It's important.
Are you saying all this just to try and save the project?
No, I'm not.
I'm not at all sure
I want to save it, not if...
Not if what?
Well, there are dangers, the imponderables.
Look, I've got a piece of airplane alloy here.
Would Laird experiment on this, do you think?
Well, if our new assistant can get the computer going, we might try it tonight.
Let's go and find out.
Oh, I wouldn't say anything to Dr. Laird about the effects over a distance, not yet anyway.
Mm-hmm.
Come in, Miss Dupont.
Gil, Gil, you were hopelessly wrong.
Miss Dupont is brilliant and not at all bossy.
She's not a bit frustrated, and I think she's quite good-looking.
Don't you?
What do you think, Brigadier?
Oh, I'm of your opinion, Doctor, though I know nothing about computers.
She's fixed it, Gil.
We've got all the power we need... for the time being.
That's fine. The brigadier would like for us to cook this tonight.
And why not?
You'll stay and watch us?
Yes, I think I will.
It should be interesting.
Hello.
Hello.
Have you got one yet?
No.
Jane!
What do you mean talking to that tramp?
- How dare you?
- He's nice.
I met him in the woods yesterday.
- What?
- He likes insects, too.
He's promised to give me a flea when he can catch one.
I'll give you a flea.
Come on in this minute.
How many times have I told you not to speak to strange men?
Tell me, what do you do for entertainment here?
- Entertainment?
- Yes.
Well, we have television.
Of course, we don't have much time for that sort of thing.
Once in a while,
I combine my pleasures and watch it down at the village pub.
Oh, I adore village pubs.
Do you often go?
Often as I can. Like to join me sometime?
- I'd love to.
- Good.
Better warn you, though, we're not very popular down there.
No? Why?
Well, they seem to think that some of our activities up here create some odd interferences in their TV and radio.
- Is it possible?
- Dr. Laird doesn't think so.
And you, do you think so?
Could be.
Is... is what we're doing dangerous?
Not yet.
But then you were thinking of Sayers.
No, I was not thinking of that kind of danger.
- That's to be expected.
- Yes.
You know, I've been thinking.
You don't have to stay here.
I mean, you'll be going back to France pretty soon.
Why not?
I'm not scared, Mr. Graham.
No, of course not.
You know, we're all kind of, as the English say,
"matey" around here.
Makes things easier.
Think you can manage to call me by my first name?
Gil,isn't it?
- Gil.
- Oh.
I saw your name in the letter you brought.
- Michellin?
- Michele.
Oh, that's it, Michele, yes.
I like that. It suits you.
You didn't answer my question.
- About the danger?
- Yes.
You see, I'm no expert in magnetic fields, but it just occurred to me this field
Dr. Laird is using here, well, it's a very large field, isn't it?
I mean, isn't it possible?
Could it spread outwards?
Dr. Laird doesn't seem to worry.
Laird. You're always telling me what Laird thinks or doesn't think.
I'm asking you.
I think you're a very clever young woman.
Mm-hmm. I see.
And bossy?
- Oh, now, wait a minute.
- Frustrated?
Look, Michele, you're taking unfair advantage.
I mean, after all,
I didn't know you then.
What I mean is the female scientist types that I've always known were, uh, shall we say, different.
Mm-hmm. I'm sure.
Well, I think we'll call the others.
Oh, Michele, look, your letter of introduction... what I mean is, is there anything besides your name?
Oh, yes.
Bachelor of science.
- Yeah, but...
- And mademoiselle.
Mademoiselle.
Well, that do make it nice.
That's American slang.
It means that do make it nice.
Oh.
Well, Doctor, I'd like to get back tonight.
Do you think we could start?
Certainly, if that remarkable young lady has finished her work.
Shall we go down?
Oh, by the way, have you a watch?
Yes.
I should leave it here if I were you.
Watches are delicate mechanisms.
They're best not taken too near magnetic fields.
All metals in the lab are either nonmagnetic or have been demagnetized.
I see.
There's no danger, of course.
All right, Gil, switch on the recorder.
We record everything, Brigadier.
It's useful for checking later.
But surely tapes are magnetic.
Very smart, Miss Dupont, and you're quite right.
No, we don't use tapes.
We have a microphone, and we record on disc in the next room.
Switch on the generators, Gil.
I'll take the circuits.
- But, Dr. Laird...
- Over here, Brigadier.
Do sit down, Brigadier.
Thank you.
Circuit A on.
Computer?
Computer on.
Circuit B on.
Integrate.
Integrating.
Ten... hold.
- All ready, Gil?
- All set, sir.
Right, steady now.
GF2.
Gently.
Gently.
GF2, over.
Three banks under reserve in operation, Doctor.
Good.
Switching off power!
Look out, Michele!
What the devil are you doing?
Good heavens, sir.
Are you hurt?
No, I don't think so.
Must be the rough skin.
Oh, I'm sorry.
It was the only thing to do.
- What happened?
- I don't know.
I'm sorry.
It was my fault.
I left my keys in there.
That was very careless of me.
You seem to have been successful, Doctor.
Look. What's that?
All in the "Standard"!
All the latest!
Big storm on the south coast!
All in the "Standard"!
Big storm on the south coast, all the latest!
Ah, let's see.
Ah, yes.
Quote, "Is space travel..."
No, no. Unquote.
I'm sorry, yes. Let's see.
Quote,
"Could they invade us?"
Unquote. Yes, something like that.
Then, we will carry a follow-up on page three with readers' letters.
They'll have seen hundreds of ruddy flying saucers by the time we're through with them.
Okay.
Who exactly is invading us? Mars?
Hey? Oh, oh, no.
They won't like that.
- Who? The Martians?
- Um, idiot, no. The...
No, make it... make it, uh...
Yes, that's it, Planet X.
The invasion from Planet X.
Well, that was some of your bold fast, if you don't mind my saying, sir.
Yesterday you're all for folding up poor old Lair.
Today, you tell the committee...
Look, Wilson, I couldn't say all I wanted to in front of the committee.
Hey, they're supposed to be in the picture.
- They have to decide...
- No, the picture's changed.
This affair is too big for the committee to handle.
There are security risks.
I'm afraid I don't quite follow.
You showed us the alloy, and I'll admit it was most impressive, but we knew something of this before.
I showed you and the committee one piece of alloy, the piece Laird put into his apparatus.
Now, this is the other piece you gave me.
Look.
Now, that remained in this case during the whole experiment.
It and the case and the hook it was hanging from ended up by flying right across the laboratory and almost injuring the new assistant.
Not another one.
Oh, she's all right thanks to Gil Graham.
But don't you see?
This wasn't in the confounded witch's cauldron.
I see.
Do you? Look at this.
That fell off the TV area along Laird's roof.
It's a different alloy, but it's gone the same way as the rest, at least 30 feet away from the apparatus.
You know what you're saying, don't you?
Yes. Action at a distance, the military's dream.
Look, Wilson, from now on, this is top security.
All right. We'd better call in
Jimmy Murray in that case.
Yes, I think we'd better.
Come in.
Hi. How are you feeling?
Broken neck would feel worse, I guess.
Do you always take your female assistants in a low-flying tackle like that?
Depends on the mood.
When I'm away from an intense magnetic field, my technique's a little different.
I should hope not.
You didn't come here to demonstrate, did you?
Might be kind of interesting.
- Help yourself.
- Thanks.
No. As a matter of fact, Michele,
I... I have something else on my mind.
Can't say I'm sorry.
What's the trouble?
Before I grabbed you last night,
I switched off the power from the generators.
Yes?
That should've shut the whole machine off at once.
Well, it did surely.
Laird was pretty furious.
Think back for a minute, Michele.
- Must I?
- Please.
Okay.
After we hit the floor, the... the briefcase flew across the room into the computer.
Correct.
GF2 was arcing then.
Right.
Then, how the devil could that be?
With the current off, the whole contraption should've been dead.
That's right, but...
There's another thing, too.
Of course, that screaming noise!
Yeah, well, then I'm not crazy.
- You do remember.
- Yes.
The circuits continued to operate after I'd switched off the power.
But, Gil, what are we saying?
This is completely ridiculous.
You couldn't have switched it off.
Yes, I did. I checked the switch this morning.
There was no current flowing from the generator when GF2 arced, when that briefcase flew across the room, and while the circuits continued to scream.
- There's one way of checking.
- How's that?
- The recording.
- Of course.
What's the matter with me?
- Come on!
- Wait.
- What? What's the matter?
- I'm still creaky.
- Let me give you a hand.
- Thanks.
You don't look all that fragile, you know.
This is the bit.
Listen.
Switching off power!
Look out, Michele!
Well?
Gil, what does it mean?
I don't know.
That apparatus was receiving power from some place, somehow.
The storm maybe?
No. That's absurd.
But very likely.
Gil?
I'm scared.
Yeah, well, so am I, Michele.
So Laird's circus gets top security rating?
That's about it, Jimmy.
Well, if you both think so.
Don't you?
Frankly, Brigadier,
I just don't register yet.
What you have been telling me sounds, well...
I know. I know.
But you will take my word for it at the moment.
Okay. But what with you and Laird, freak storms, and the press going to town about flying saucers and invasions from Planet X,
I'm beginning to feel like Dan Dare.
Am I likely to meet any little green horrors with eyes on the ends of their whiskers?
I don't think that at all likely, though you may meet some characters with snow on their boots, if you know what I mean.
Yes, I know.
And you know we've had a call from Air Force security saying that three of their radar stations report sighting some unidentified object?
Do you think there's any connection between this and Laird's work?
I don't know.
I just don't know, but we must take every possible precaution.
You and Wilson travel down separately.
Okay.
Wilson will supervise the ordering and delivery of Laird's new equipment.
It's going down in plain vans.
- Watch it, Murray.
- I will.
And remember, Wilson, you must impress on Laird the importance of a wide margin of safety this time.
Laird seems to be a tricky customer to give advice to.
He is. In fact, he's more than tricky. He's...
Oh, well, I suppose you must make some allowance for genius.
And work in close touch with Graham.
I'm pretty sure he's aware of the risk.
And they must understand the whole aim of the project now is to make the force directional.
Right, sir.
Keep in touch, and the best of luck.
I hope that fence will work.
It's costing enough.
Yeah, it should form an anti-magnetic screen.
Particularly ugly one.
There ought to be a law about corrugated iron.
Another lorry load of cabins arriving.
You know, this is getting a bit ridiculous.
Besides, creating a condenser to make it look like a sight board is darned expensive.
I'd better go down and check it in.
Right. Oh, Gerald, when you're finished,
I'd like to have a private word with you.
Okay, I'll be back.
All right.
Did I frighten you? I'm sorry.
I'm not frightened. I... I was just going home anyway.
I don't know you.
What is your name?
- Smith.
- Smith?
We've got a teacher at school called Smith.
Are you her husband?
No.
Good. I hate her.
She threw my bugs away.
- Bugs?
- Mm-hmm.
She called them insects, of course.
She's very stupid.
And weren't they insects?
Some were. You see, all insects are bugs, but all bugs are not insects.
And is that what you were doing just now, collecting bugs?
- What were you doing?
- Oh, nothing.
Um, please, I was just trying to find my way.
My goodness.
Are you lost?
Yes.
Fancy getting lost in Bryerly Woods.
Is this Bryerly Woods?
Of course it is.
Everyone knows that.
Are you a foreigner?
You look like one.
You've got funny whiskers.
Yes, I suppose I am.
At least, I came here from a long way off.
What's so funny about my whiskers anyway?
I haven't seen anyone else with funny whiskers like that.
Well, perhaps I'd better shave them off then.
I don't want want to look funny or different from anybody else.
How did you get here?
If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.
I would, you know.
Even if I said
I came on the back of a giant dragonfly?
Oh, no. There aren't any drag... dragonflies.
There are where I come from.
There aren't any drag... dragonflies anywhere.
What about on the moon then?
Oh, well, if you come from the moon, that's different.
Where are you staying?
I don't know.
As a matter of fact,
I'm looking for somewhere to stay.
I expect we could've put you up at our house, only there's a new lodger coming today.
I don't think I shall like her.
Her name's Forsyth, and she's going to be the new teacher at our school.
Is there anywhere else around here
I may be able to stay?
I don't supposed they'd put you up.
They're very narrow-minded.
Oh, of course.
Are there any big places around here, you know, factories, workshops, anything like that?
Nothing like that, only Dr. Laird's house, of course, but it's no good going there.
He's a mad inventor.
And what does he invent?
It's a secret.
No one knows.
- Well, I must go home.
- Why is Dr. Laird mad?
Almost every night, he switches on his machine and busts up all the television sets.
- Where does he live?
- It's no good.
He won't take lodgers.
You can see his house from the top of the hill.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Mm.
Now, let me get this straight.
What you're trying to tell me, as I see it, is that this fearsome contraption of yours went on working after you'd cut off the current.
Is that it?
That's it.
I speak from unfathomable depths of ignorance, but is that so very remarkable?
Of course it is.
If I switch off, say, an electric fan, wouldn't it go on turning for a while?
Momentum or something?
Yeah, but you wouldn't get an electric shock from the terminal.
Our circuit, GF2 we call it, leapt across about 5 seconds after I switched off the power.
That's impossible.
That's what I keep telling myself and Dr. Laird.
What did he say?
Same as you did... impossible.
Refuses to listen.
There's more to it than that, too, Gerald.
You know, I'm not the brains of this joint, but I've been figuring a few things out during the past 10 days.
That apparatus was building up a field far in excess of anything that we could've reasonably expected from the power we were feeding into it.
Personally, I think you're all getting slightly neurotic over this business.
Did you say you had a recording of the session?
That's right.
You ought to hear it.
Hmm. That's funny.
It's gone.
This looks like a case for Jimmy Murray.
- Where is he?
- On his way down from London.
I promised to meet him for a pint in the Crown and Mitre this evening.
You'd better come, too.
Yeah.
Shall I bring Michele?
Not necessary.
She's coming.
I asked her this morning.
Oh. I'm gonna start getting up earlier.
Aah!
Help! Help! Help!
Aah!
Help!
Are you all right?
Yes, I think so.
Wait a minute.
Thank you.
Where do you live?
Well, I'm going to Bryerly Bay.
I'm a teacher.
I started the school there on London.
Bryerly Bay? Well, after we've reported this to the police,
I'll take you there.
Please sit down, Mr. Murray.
Thank you, Inspector.
We're taking a statement from Miss Forsyth now.
I understand you're taking her home to her lodgings at Bryerly Bay.
Yes, I was taking her myself, to Dr. Laird's establishment.
Inspector, what are you going to do about this man?
Well, we'll comb the woods, of course.
But first, let me ask you a question.
Oh, I don't say I should be able to reply.
I know you security chaps, but this is important.
You see, a man has been seen in the woods, and it's been reported that he has a large burn mark on his face.
Tell me, has Laird been using radioactive materials?
I can tell you that, Inspector.
The answer is no, definitely no.
Thank you, sir.
Well, we'll have to try another line of approach.
Come in.
Miss Forsyth's ready now, sir.
Right. Just coming.
Well, goodbye, Inspector.
Goodbye, and thank you very much for all your help.
What about another drink?
Not for me, thanks.
Pass.
Do you mind if I...
No.
You're very quiet, Gil.
What's on your mind?
Oh, nothing.
Everything.
You mean you feel comme ci, comme ca?
Eh.
How long you known Gerald?
Why? Does it matter?
Sorry.
Didn't mean to interfere or intrude.
I don't want to quarrel with you, Gil.
Cheers.
I wonder where that man Murray is.
He was supposed to meet us here.
What will you have, sir?
What's that?
Well, old Boggs?
Mild and bitter.
I'll have that.
Certainly, sir.
That music you hear comes from a proper band.
- At last.
- Sorry I'm late.
Okay. Meet Michele Dupont and Gil Graham.
- How do you do?
- How are you?
- What's the trouble?
- Things have been happening.
There's a maniac at large in the woods.
- A what?
- Maniac?
Oh, there you are.
Nice of you to take me dancing.
What are all the pretty girls going to do now that they haven't got
Gene Kelly to dance with, nurse their perishing colds?
- Oh, I haven't been long.
- Oh, no.
You were going to get me a drink half an hour ago.
I thought you were going to have a nice cup of tea.
Tea? Get me a glass of nourishing stout.
All right, love.
Evening, Art.
Evening, Mrs. Packer.
Evening, Mr. Graham.
Oh, hello, Art.
Where's Gillian?
- Isn't she here?
- I haven't seen her.
Well, you see, I was supposed to be working late tonight.
And, well, she said she'd meet me here.
- Here you are.
- That's women for you.
Can't let them out of your sight.
Never mind, Art. Have a drink.
I'd expect Gillian's had to wait until her dad's got home.
She hasn't been too well lately.
No, I, uh, I think
I'll stroll down the lane and see if I can meet her.
I thought the band was noisy.
The microphone was too near the loudspeaker.
A syndrome, that's it.
That's what was the matter.
We had a syndrome in the... in the magnetic field.
Are you all right, old boy?
What the dickens are you babbling about?
You understand, don't you, Michele?
- Yes, I believe I do.
- Would you mind explaining?
Or have you both gone crazy?
Did you hear that screech from the loudspeaker?
- I'm not deaf.
- Yeah, well, look.
The microphone was too near to the speaker.
The sound goes in.
It comes out louder, back into the microphone, around and out louder still and so on and so on.
It's called a syndrome.
You mean a sort of vicious circle?
That's right. And if you don't put a stop to it, it keeps piling up and piling up until the amplifier or some part of the circuit goes bust.
I get it.
But why all the dramatics?
Have you got your car here?
Yes, why?
I want to get back to the lab.
What? Now?
I've got to see Dr. Laird right away.
You do understand, don't you, Michele?
Yes, I do. I think you ought to go.
Can't you tell us what all the excitement's about?
I'll try and explain.
You must go.
You'll be all right, won't you?
Of course.
Come on. Let's go.
Oh, Gerald, I'm sorry, but this is important.
Gil, I hope you know what you're talking about.
So do I.
Let's be practical, my boy.
You make an excellent theoretical case for the build-up in the field being syndromic.
But where exactly in the circuit does the phenomenon occur?
As I see it, it's between these two circuits.
You have a first-class brain,
Gil. It's a pity that you allow your imagination to run away with you.
Meaning what?
Meaning that, in the first place, you have reached the correct conclusion from the wrong premise.
Oh, I don't understand.
Secondly, that you are allowing a self-evident fact to scare you.
You were driven to your clever piece of reasoning by worrying about a lot of silly diddle daddle, freak storms and the like.
Haven't you considered the possibility that we might've caused some of the things which took place that night?
I never consider anything which might interfere with my research.
Seems rather short-sighted, doesn't it?
If one always stopped to calculate the risks, there would be no research.
But you think I'm right about the syndrome?
I know you're right.
I reached the same conclusion over a week ago.
Well, but you said nothing...
Because I knew you would be all for delay.
Well, wouldn't that be the wiser course, Dr. Laird?
I don't think so.
We have accidentally stumbled upon the secret of producing an enormously more powerful magnetic field than we had ever hoped for.
We have saved ourselves years of work, and you want to throw those years away.
No, I don't want to do that.
I just feel that we ought to proceed with the utmost caution.
We have new equipment, more powerful generators but the same circuits.
We have taken great precautions, the iron fence, for instance, the direction field, better insulation and the screening between the terminals of GF2.
Yes, well as I see it, the screening of the GF2 terminals is the main danger.
It's like, uh, like putting a 6-inch nail across a 5-amp house fuse.
Perhaps you would allow me to be the best judge of that.
I've been engaged in this work all my life.
Well, I'm sorry.
I... I didn't mean to sound impertinent.
Not impertinent, just frightened, and a frightened assistant is no good to me.
If you would care to terminate your appointment here?
Oh, of course not.
I...
I wouldn't think of deserting you at this stage of the game in any case.
Please do not allow questions of personal loyalty to affect you.
Under the circumstances,
I wouldn't.
I was thinking more the complicated operation of the apparatus.
It's not so complicated now, you know.
It will be possible for only one person to operate.
Yes, sir.
Gillian!
Gillian! Gillian!
Gillian.
No.
Aah!
Now then, go ahead down.
How about a drink?
Is the bar closed?
Yes, sir. The dance goes on until midnight.
It's getting very late.
Is it that I'm positively repulsive?
Or could there be someone else?
I'm afraid there is.
I'm sorry.
I just realized it now.
- Gil?
- Please, let's go.
Lucky devil.
Ah, Miss Dupont, are you going?
- Yes, why?
- It's Gillian Betts.
They've just found her.
Is young Art here?
What's happened?
An accident?
No, sir, not an accident, murder.
Murder?
Well, what's this?
In Bryerly Woods, sir.
There's a maniac.
- Are you quite sure?
- I can't say any more.
No, course not.
Darling, are you all right?
- Yes, but we can't we go?
- You are together, sir?
- Yes.
- And you have a car?
- Oh, yes.
- Then that'll be all right.
You see, we haven't found the fellow yet.
And what about you, sir?
Are you with...
No, Officer.
I am alone.
If you're going past Bryerly Woods,
I don't think you ought to be by yourself, sir.
Could I give you a lift?
Thank you.
Not at all. My car's outside.
Goodnight, miss.
Goodnight, sir.
Goodnight. I'll warn the others upstairs.
Right.
Where shall I drop you, Mr...
Smith.
If you could drop me at the other end of the village near Dr. Laird's house.
Oh, yes. We're going that way.
Thank you.
I'm just thinking, that young man went to meet Gillian.
Don't you think we should tell the police?
Yes, of course.
I'll go back in and tell him.
Will you forgive me if I take this opportunity of speaking to you?
What is it?
I overheard what Mr. Graham said tonight about syndromes.
Well?
You see, I understand something of your work.
How much?
Who are you anyway?
That is not important.
I must speak to you and Mr. Graham as soon as possible.
It will have to be tomorrow after we have finished our work at the lab.
Very well. Shall we say here at 6 o'clock?
- All right.
- Okay. I told him. Let's go.
Did he give you any clue as to why he wanted to meet you and Gil?
Not really, but he seemed to know a lot about our work.
- You didn't tell him anything?
- Of course not, Jimmy.
I'm not that stupid.
Well, I don't like it.
I just don't like it.
Who is this chap, Smith?
Know anything about him, Gerald?
Not a thing.
Gil?
I saw him for the first time tonight at the dance.
Gerald, when you took him in the car tonight, did he say where he lived?
No, he just told me to drop him near here.
Yes, he said it was okay to drop him here.
That's right. He must be staying in the village.
Well, that should make it easy for us to keep tabs on him.
Gil, Michele, you must meet him tomorrow evening as arranged.
What's the drill?
See if he tries to pump you about Laird's work.
Find out all you can.
Right.
How did Laird react to your inspiration, Gil?
What, the syndrome? Mm-hmm.
He guessed it already.
Ah, that's tough.
Is it going to foul things up?
Nope. He's pressing on regardless.
You're worried, aren't you?
I am. I'm in a bit of a fix.
I... I don't like to go behind the old man's back, but I think we're moving along a little too fast.
Hmm, that apparatus is ready to work, but nobody knows for sure what it'll do.
Doesn't Laird know?
You try asking him.
I almost got sacked tonight.
Oh, no, Gil.
Would you like me to contact Cartwright?
Well, I think we should in any case, but he better not come here, not with Laird in his present mood.
I agree.
Where then?
Oh, police headquarters.
Royal Inspector Burns ought to be put more in the picture.
We may need his help yet.
Just you say, Jimmy.
I'll phone Cartwright in the morning.
I'll meet him at the station in the car.
Well, if there's nothing else, time for bed. Would you mind?
Oh, yes.
Coming, Jimmy?
Hmm?
Oh, yeah.
I'll see you two before you meet Smith.
- Good night.
- All right. Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I'm, uh, I'm sorry about tonight.
I didn't mean to butt in.
It isn't really any of my business.
Isn't it, Gil?
After you had gone,
Gerald kissed me.
Why tell me?
I'm not enjoying it.
Neither did I. Funny, isn't it?
Well, that's too bad.
I'm sorry.
Are you really?
Not really.
I enjoyed that.
Hmm, so did I.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Feeling better?
- Yes, much better. Thanks.
This is Jane.
I'm staying at her house for the time being.
She's taking me to see her school.
I'm going to catch a beetle for her. They're horrid-looking.
I'm terribly thrilled about that.
When does school start?
On Monday. I've got the key from the head so I can look around my classroom and get everything ready.
You both like being busy, what with beetles and school.
Look, I'm rather tied up today, but I thought of taking a boat out tomorrow, Sunday.
When did you think about that?
Just a moment ago.
I can't think why.
- Care to come?
- I'd love to.
I must fly now. Got to meet my chief off the train.
Oh, by the way, Jane, ever met a man called Smith in the village?
No, but I met a Mr. Smith in the woods.
- What?
- He's nice.
He helps me look for insects.
Oh. Well, if you meet him again, try and find out where he lives, will you?
I can't.
So that's our school, Jane?
Are you going in, Miss Forsyth?
Yes, I must.
Oh, well. If you must.
And you?
I'm going to look for that beetle larvae.
All right.
But don't be late home.
- You promised your mother.
- I won't. Goodbye.
- A lot of beers here, George.
- Thank you, sir.
There we are.
Thanks.
Just right.
Thank you, sir.
All right,
Mr. Smith, shoot.
I'll come straight to the point, Mr. Graham.
I overheard your conversation last night, and that led me to suppose that you are concerned with Dr. Laird's experiments.
I see.
And what's your interest in those experiments?
Will you accept, for the moment, that it is purely scientific?
Go on.
I take a great interest in the subject of magnetic fields, Mr. Graham.
Why not? What's that got to do with Dr. Laird's experiment?
Will you also accept that
I am not a complete fool?
All right.
Thank you.
Dr. Laird is no doubt a very clever man.
He must be to have built an apparatus capable of recently causing such atmospheric disturbance.
However, I suspect he is also a single-minded man and possibly an unimaginative one.
Mr. Graham, the earth has a magnetic field.
Have you considered the dangers of upsetting that field?
It has happened before in history, you know, with catastrophic results.
Yes. Yes, I've considered the possibility.
You seem to be a remarkably well informed man, Mr. Smith.
Please go on.
There is also another danger, the danger of radioactive rays.
We're not using any radioactive materials.
I know that, but not all radioactive particles are man-made.
There is another source.
Yes, that's true.
There are cosmic rays.
They bombard us constantly, but they... they do little apparent harm.
Because you are shielded from all but the harmless ones by the ionosphere, the... the so-called heavy-side layer.
The heavier it is, the sodium, for example, never normally reach the earth.
Yes, that's true, but, uh, but I don't quite follow you.
Mr. Graham, the ionosphere could be affected by magnetism.
It could be bent or fractured.
But surely the ionosphere is 50 or 60 miles up?
And ships at sea 18 miles away were affected by your experiment.
Don't you see?
If, at the points of maximum strength of your field, the heavy side layer had been temporarily fractured or pulled down close to the earth, heavy and possibly dangerous cosmic rays could've reached the Earth's surface and may have affected many people in strange ways.
How do you mean?
I mean, they may have been driven mad.
The human beings who may have been affected by the rays will probably all die, though not before they may have killed many people.
But there is something else.
It would normally take many years for any change to become apparent in the human race or in animals with a long gestation period.
But what of the quick breeders, the insects?
Insects?
Oh, mon dieu, no.
Yes.
Some insects, ants, spiders could already have mutated.
In what way?
That is impossible to say.
They could've become a different species.
They could've become smaller or much larger.
Look, some of my colleagues are in a conference now at the police station.
Would you come along with me and state your case to them?
No, Mr. Graham.
I'd rather not.
- But why not?
- There are reasons.
Besides, they would probably regard me as a crank.
- Well, I... I don't.
- I hoped you wouldn't.
That's why I chose to speak to you.
- Well, then please...
- No, Mr. Graham.
The responsibility rests with you.
I can only wish your success.
Miss Dupont.
Well, Gil, what do you think?
I think he may be right, Michele.
Look, I... I want to go see Cartwright.
Can you make it home all right alone?
Of course.
Darling, make them believe you.
I know you can be very persuasive when you want to.
Right.
Excuse me, miss.
Being as you're a scientist,
I wish you would look at what our Jane's found.
I rung the police, but they didn't say much.
And, well, I don't like the look of it.
Do you have something to boil this in?
- Well, yes. I have.
- You boil it immediately.
- Boil it, Miss? But...
- Please, Mrs. Hale.
Don't argue. You boil it.
You understand? You boil it.
It's very dangerous.
And, incidentally, you lock your door and close all your windows and keep everybody inside.
- But what about Miss Forsyth?
- Who is Miss Forsyth?
My new lodger, the new school teacher, she's still out.
She went to the school this afternoon.
Where is the school?
Well, the quickest way is through the woods.
There's a path opposite.
Don't worry.
I'll find Miss Forsyth.
The whole idea is utter nonsense.
The chap's trying to scare us off.
I'm surprised at you, Gil.
I'm inclined to agree.
I certainly think this man, Smith, needs pulling in for further questioning.
You know anything about him, Inspector?
Not a thing.
But then there are quite a lot of Smiths about.
Exactly. He's too good to be true.
Who is he?
Where does he come from?
I can't get a lead on him anywhere.
All the same, I agree with Graham.
We must hold up all further experiments with Laird's apparatus until a thorough check-over has been made.
All right, that's agreed.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Inspector Burns here.
Yes.
What?
Mark Davison's been found, dead, mutilated.
Oh, my.
His body was cleaned dry of blood.
You see? Smith was right.
It's those insects.
They've mutated, and they're hungry.
- Oh, come off it.
- Shut up, will you, Jimmy?
Inspector, Brigadier, you've got to cordon off those woods.
Insects are tremendous eaters.
There won't be anything left long in there.
Get me every available man.
Graham's right.
No, give me that telephone.
This is a military operation.
Get me the nearest army depot.
Aah!
Bryerly Woods.
That's it. Goodbye.
Graham, get down to the lab at once.
On no account must Laird touch that damn machine of his.
- Yes, sir.
- Where's Wilson?
He should be at Laird's house.
I'll phone him.
He can have a word with Laird.
Yes, son?
Well, Sergeant, I didn't think it was important at first, but now...
Well? Well?
Mrs. Hale, sir, she rang up to say her daughter had found a whopping great egg.
What was that?
An egg, sir.
Who said that?
Mrs. Hale, sir.
And she said that her lodger, a Miss Forsyth, was out late.
Oh, no. Does she know where she went?
She was at the village school, sir.
Gil, quick, Bryerly School!
Go back! Go back!
Aah!
Aah!
Helen! Helen!
Are you all right?
Helen?
There's another girl in the woods.
Who is it?
From, uh...
Dr. Laird's assistant.
- Michele!
- Gil, come back!
Mr. Graham!
Michele... she's in here!
I'll come with you. Hurry.
Michele!
Michele!
Wait!
What do you mean, wait!
Leave this to me!
This way.
Aah!
Oh, what is it? What is it?
I just had a message from
Brigadier Cartwright, Dr. Laird.
Oh, I can't be bothered with you or Cartwright just now.
I'm sorry, Doctor.
This is important.
So is this, much more important than anything Cartwright has to gossip about, and I'm nearly ready for testing.
It's about that. You mustn't operate the machine.
I must not operate my own apparatus?
Did you say that...
I'm afraid I did!
Some entirely new factors have arisen which make it imperative that all testing shall be indefinitely delayed.
Indefinitely delayed?
How easily wise old bureaucrats betray a red-tape fetish.
Indefinitely delayed.
There will be no delay,
Mr. Wilson.
I alone am competent to decide when this apparatus shall be tested, not some two-penny brass hat or upstart civil servant.
Now, get out!
Dr. Laird, don't be ridiculous.
Put that gun down.
You're behaving like a madman.
- Nobody wants to interfere.
- Get out!
If you say another word,
I'll shoot you.
Do you understand?
I'll shoot you.
Please listen.
This apparatus has cost lives.
It is dangerous.
Feeling better, Michele?
You're going to be all right, Michele.
Well, I think we've covered this section of the woods, Mr. Murray.
I wouldn't like that job again.
Any casualties?
It's a good job we acted when we did.
The woods were thick with eggs.
Another few days and we'd...
Yes, all right.
There is to be no relaxing.
Keep patrolling all night and tomorrow we'll have a thorough comb-out.
You better report to Brigadier
Cartwright straight away.
Right, sir.
Good Lord.
To think we have to do this in every wood in the country.
That will not be necessary,
Mr. Murray.
Hmm?
Mr. Smith.
One or two questions
I'd like to ask you.
Where do you come from?
Uh, Jimmy, uh, I'm afraid that's going to be a kind of an awkward question for him to answer.
- Isn't it, Mr. Smith?
- Yes, indeed.
Uh, you said that some of the RAF boys had reported unidentified objects flying south.
Yes, that's right.
The usual sort of nonsense.
Yes, well, this time, it wasn't nonsense,
I'm afraid.
Was it, Mr. Smith?
I landed here shortly after your first disastrous experiment.
Landed?
What are you talking about?
Well, this is difficult.
Let me put it this way,
Mr. Murray.
Without being aware of it, your newspapers were very near the truth when they spoke of mysterious invaders from Planet X.
Am I going crazy?
In fact, there was but one invader.
It was I.
Jimmy, I... I realize it's going to be a little hard for you to believe.
But the truth of the matter is, Mr. Smith is the legendary character from outer space.
Right?
Get me Brigadier Cartwright.
Hurry.
Cartwright here.
Cartwright?
Wilson here.
Listen.
Laird's gone mad.
What's that?
No. Don't talk.
Listen.
He shot me.
Come... quick.
For heaven's sake, come.
He's alone.
Wilson!
Wilson!
Wilson...
Wilson!
Wilson!
We have had your planet under close observation for many years.
Flying saucers?
That's what you have chosen to call our spacecraft.
We've also been monitoring your radio.
That's how I come to speak passable English.
But, you... you are like us.
Is that so very surprising,
Miss Forsyth?
There are many planets with the same physical conditions as here on Earth.
And, on them, life has gone through the same evolutionary processes.
Where is this Planet X?
If I were to tell you, you would neither understand nor believe me.
Time and space are still the great mysteries to you.
Why have you come to pay us this visit?
Because of your experiments in magnetism.
You brought down one of our spacecraft on the night of your experiment.
Our craft use the planetary lines of magnetic attraction as their means of propulsion.
That's why we were so concerned with your experiments, alarmed, I might say.
We had to act in what you would call enlightened self-interest.
Is that the only reason that you came?
No. We have never interfered with your development before.
But, this time, your entire planet was in danger.
It still is if you continue with your experiments.
You mean we might reverse the Earth's polarity, tilt the Earth on its axis?
Yes, I do.
It has happened before, but then the force was extraterrestrial.
I thought you said there was no further danger from these insects.
That is correct.
We were able to calculate the center of disturbance and the points of maximum intensity.
This, I assure you, is the only place on land to be affected by cosmic ray bombardment.
On land?
There were some areas in the sea.
There, life will have been spontaneously created, microscopically, just as it was millions of years ago before there was an ionosphere to protect you.
You've had a very narrow escape, Mr. Graham.
Well?
Message from Brigadier Cartwright, sir.
Will you and Mr. Graham come down to Dr. Laird's house immediately?
- What's happened?
- It's Mr. Wilson, sir.
He's been shot.
Gerald shot?
Is he...
We're afraid he's dead.
Dr. Laird seems to have gone mad, and the Brigadier's worried he may start his machines again, sir.
I was afraid of this.
We've got to stop him.
Let me come with you.
It's like I thought, locked and bolted.
We could break it down, I suppose?
We might, but it'd be a tough job.
It'd take hours.
Oh, that will be enough to set him off.
Look here, Smith.
Can you help us?
Do you really want me to?
Of course we do.
Smith, there's very little time left.
If Laird switches on that infernal machine... well, I understand you know more about these things than we do?
I do, sir.
We must stop him.
Can you help us?
Look. How about that... that gun thing, the one you used to kill the spider with?
No. I can help you, but the decision for what I do must be yours.
Go on.
It is a question of one man's life or perhaps the very existence of the Earth.
That's not a difficult decision.
For us, it would be.
Life is more simple for you.
Your press has spoken of our world as Planet X.
We too have the equivalent of X in our language.
Our children learn in their schools about the strange world of Planet X.
You mean, uh...
Yes.
Yours is the strange world, Mr. Graham.
Brigadier, if I were to destroy this machine, would you promise me not to rebuild it?
I give you my word.
Without Laird,
I don't think we could.
- Right, Graham?
- Absolutely right.
Very well.
I want you to take your men away from the house, well away.
What are you going to do?
Mr. Graham, Miss Dupont, would you come with me, please?
Now we must wait.
There it is.
Goodbye.
Will you come back?
Who knows?
NARRATOR: First in Alaska and then
Invading steadily southward, there
Were reports of a new species.
The giant killer shrew.
[THUNDER]
Sure is a lot of quiet out there.
Almost smell it, can't you?
No, I but I can feel it.
That pressure's dropped so fast it's almost made my ears pop.
Hurricanes got definite ways of telling you it's there.
Where is it?
Dead ahead.
What's that mean to us?
Now boy, that puts our port right in the middle of it.
There's a cove on the east side though.
We'll snuggle up close to the bluff and ride it out.
What about the bottom?
Well, the chart shows it's good holding ground.
It's clay.
You know something?
If this thing had an automatic pilot,
I wouldn't have to put up with you.
Then you wouldn't have nobody to chew out.
We should be there in a couple of hours.
These mills of yours keep running.
Look, automatic pilots can't play dixieland jazz
On their [INAUDIBLE] like I can.
Hey, Rook.
Rook, come here.
Take a look.
There she is, dead ahead.
Man, that sure do look good.
Man named Craigis owns this island, does he?
That's the name on the crate, Dr. Marlowe Craigis.
We'll unload tomorrow.
I don't want this crap sitting high in that water
When that blow hits.
You going to ride [INAUDIBLE] with a lot of water under?
That's right.
That sea won't make up in that cove.
That wind will have her whipping around like a kite.
Step forward and break out the heavy weather hook.
Check it and make sure it's free to run.
- I don't mind, sir.
- Good.
Ah, she'll ride like a duck.
If she swings too far to starboard
We might have to take a check line to shore.
Hey Rook, take a slant up that trail.
Now that's a rather strange set up, wouldn't you say?
Looks like somebody's getting rid of somebody, huh captain?
Maybe.
Hard to tell.
I'm Dr. Craigis.
Thorne Sherman.
I have your supplies aboard.
That's good.
Nothing wrong with Captain
[INAUDIBLE], I hope?
I wouldn't know.
I just bought his run.
Oh, I see.
Well, [INAUDIBLE] order?
Everything on the list.
Here's the manifest.
Missing last week's supply has run us a little short,
You know.
Captain, after you have unloaded,
I have a passenger for you.
Ann.
Captain Sherman, this is my daughter, Ann Craigis.
Hello.
So you're the passenger.
That's right, Captain.
Well, it's going to be nice having you aboard.
I'm getting a little tired of looking at Griswold.
But we're, uh, we're not leaving today.
In fact, we're not even unloading.
That load will cut the roll in half.
You expecting an invasion?
Yes, animals.
Game or otherwise?
Under certain conditions it could be dangerous.
Hey Rook, you want to shake the kinks out, limber up a little?
Not me, Captain.
You go right ahead and stretch your legs.
That ship's going to be bucking like a bucking bronco
Before long.
Besides, I got some work left to do.
If you do come ashore, wear a gun.
Got you, Captain.
When I told you about the hurricane,
You acted like you didn't know anything about it.
What's the matter?
Your set broken down?
We have been out of communication for more than a
Week, Captain.
Can't it be fixed?
It's totally out of commission.
My assistant, Mr.
Farrell, Jerry Farrell.
Father, perhaps the captain would enjoy a drink.
Well of course.
Will you join us for a cocktail?
Well, I've never been known to turn down a drink yet.
I'd be glad to accept.
Fine.
In that case we'll have martinis.
Mario.
Si, senor?
Mix them, please.
Right this way, Captain.
Come in.
You have everything here you need?
We are self sufficient here.
We have cows for fresh milk and chickens for fresh eggs.
We even have
[INAUDIBLE] horses.
Sort of a world all your own.
That's exactly what
I've tried to create.
Well, to each his own.
If you have to be isolated for your work,
You picked a lonely little island.
Excuse me, please,
I think I'll change.
She's a little worried because you
Aren't leaving until tomorrow.
Well, I can understand that.
But there's something else bothering her.
Radford.
Radford.
Radford, would you please step over here?
I'd like you to meet someone.
Just a second, Doctor.
That could go on for hours.
Dr. Baines.
There's no need to shout,
Doctor, I'm right here.
I'd like you to meet
Captain Thorne Sherman.
This is my other assistant, Radford Baines.
How do you do?
Two new litters since lunch, Doctor.
Both support GT116.
That's good, but, uh...
We can breed them to the 205 group in about three weeks.
But I'd prefer to wait and expose about half of them
To the Hoskins factor first.
If you agree.
Good idea.
Do you know there's a hurricane coming?
Hurricane?
Well, I don't suppose there's much we can do about that.
Glad to meet you.
Sherman, was it?
You have to excuse Radford.
Anything that does not concern his
Project cannot get through to him.
Brilliant mind.
He would starve to death if someone
Didn't remind him to eat.
Must be very interesting work.
What's his field?
Biology.
He specializes in genetics, heredity.
I'm afraid my interest doesn't run in that line, you know.
Think what would happen if you could isolate and identify
The inherited
[INAUDIBLE] in each gene.
Now wait a minute.
I'm afraid I'm not very good with pure research.
This is practical research.
[INAUDIBLE] mammals, the smaller the size, the higher
The metabolism and shorter the life span.
Yeah, right.
Well, I'm attempting to decrease the size
By maintaining a low metabolism and result
In a longer lifespan.
What reason?
Overpopulation.
Not a problem now, but it will be in time.
If we were half as big as we are now,
We could live twice as long in our natural resources.
Father, may I speak with you a moment?
Will you please excuse us, Captain?
Well, providing you drop the captain.
I prefer Thorne.
Tell me something, Doctor.
Has a hurricane ever hit this island before that you know of?
I wouldn't know.
We've only been here nine months and this place
Has been unoccupied for years.
Well have you ever been through one?
Only the fringes.
Well, this one's building up very fast.
Pressure drops very quickly in the center.
I'd advise you to get some doors and windows open in this place.
Ventillators in the roof.
And if you'll freshen Ann's drink I'll go and check them.
I'd be happy too.
Thank heavens you arrived today.
Why, are rations getting short?
No, it's more than that.
Much more.
We'll surely be able to sail tomorrow, won't we?
Possibly.
But not probable.
Not until late, anyway.
Takes a long time for a sea like that to quiet down.
Well if you're worrying about me, you needn't.
I'm a good sailor.
Oh, I'm not worried about you.
We'll sail when the time's right.
Got them opened all right.
Oh, Captain, let me freshen you a drink.
One for the road.
Not trying to rush you, but it will be dark soon.
I've invited Thorne for dinner, father.
Oh?
I see.
If you're not worried about your ship, you are welcome.
I'll take a rain check on that dinner.
If you wish.
Father.
I've asked Thorne to stay.
Progress, Doctor.
This is the sole survivor of group 30.
28 months old today.
Well that's equivalent to 140 years to us.
That's right.
Yet it still maintains low metabolism
Without any sluggishness.
It's not a breakthrough, but it certainly sets our course.
Radford, suspend series 52 through 96
And we'll concentrate on the rest.
What is that?
It's a sorex soricidae.
Looks like a small rat.
Smells like a skunk.
They have musk glands [INAUDIBLE].
These little fellas are our subjects.
They have a birth cycle of
10 to 14 days and using them
We can establish traits.
We can trace the progressions through a number
Of generations over a short period of time.
Well how big do they get?
That's an adult.
See, the muzzle is long and thicker than a rat's.
It extends over the lower mandible, see?
Does he bite?
Only when he is hungry.
Well, maybe you'd better take him.
He doesn't know me.
All he knows is his next meal.
He's just been fed.
He'll be all right for another eight hours.
[CRASHING]
[SCREAMS]
A shutter blew open.
Radford.
I got it, senor.
Don't let that scare you.
It's going to get worse.
Storms always frighten her, ever since she was a child.
They are not climbers.
They are digging animals, like the mole.
They feed only at night unless they are starving.
And when they are hungry enough, they'll
Tackle anything regardless of size.
No kidding.
If you leave two of them in a cage for 12 hours without food,
The stronger will eat the weaker.
Like cannibals.
Precisely.
You see, their intense activity requires
A tremendous amount of energy.
To supply, they must eat three times their own weight in food
Every 24 hours or starve.
Radford.
Radford, would you please take this?
Take him.
Some call them bone eaters.
When the flesh is gone, they'll eat the bones for marrow.
All they leave are teeth, horns, hooves...
I could use another martini.
Do you mind?
Of course, my dear.
I'll get you one.
There you are.
Mario?
Mario.
[SPEAKING SPANISH] Mario will show you to the bath
And you will freshen up a bit.
[SPEAKING SPANISH]
[SPEAKING SPANISH]
Excuse me.
[SPEAKING SPANISH]
You got a problem too?
Que paso?
[SPEAKING SPANISH] But you will leave on the ship tomorrow.
Well, I think that all depends on the wind and the sea,
Don't you?
Si.
Si senor.
I don't know.
Ah, [INAUDIBLE].
I feel the point.
I see.
Well, I'm glad to hear that.
Now if anybody else is concerned about my sailing
Tomorrow, why, you see they feel the point too, huh?
I don't like to repeat myself.
OK, senor.
I know, but I'm not saying that you created them, Jerry.
I am saying that because of your drunken stupidity
In leaving the cage door open, you
Created the horrible situation that now exists.
Look, Ann, this is a mistake any one of us might have made.
And I'm getting a little sick of being called
An irresponsible drunk, now believe me I am.
Excuse me.
Care for a cigarette?
Thanks.
And thank heavens you arrived today.
You said that before.
What's the strain?
If I don't make sense, please excuse me.
But it seems like everything is coming to a head at once.
Oh?
I want to leave, but I want my father to go with me.
Well then, why doesn't he?
We've discussed it many times, but he's adamant.
I'm sure Jerry has a lot to do with his decision.
He tried to convince me that the crisis
Will only last for a few...
Well.
This is certainly a cozy little scene.
Might even be called intimate.
Boy meets girl...
Stop it, Jerry.
That remark is uncalled for.
What I do or have to say does not concern you.
I can't disagree with you more, my dear.
I'm concerned with everything you do
And I intend to keep it that way.
Now on my book an engagement isn't a casual thing.
In my book it isn't either.
And last night ended ours.
[SHREWS CHATTERING]
[GUNSHOTS]
[THUNDER]
[THUNDER]
[SHREWS CHATTERING]
Help!
Help!
Captain Thorne!
Somebody help!
Help, Captain Thorne!
[THUNDER]
Be reasonable.
Everybody in the world is scared to death of something.
That's evident.
When they came at us last night you
Knocked me down getting inside the fence.
It's just that I can't stand them.
And I've discovered something I can't stand.
All right.
But I advise you not to mention it to anyone.
I'm going to complete these experiments with your father
Regardless of anything, do you understand that?
Nobody is going to take this chance away from me.
Where's Captain Sherman?
Checking the weather.
I'll get him.
Captain?
Time for dinner.
[SHREWS CHATTERING]
Help!
Somebody!
Help!
Help me!
No!
Somebody!
Help!
[GUNSHOTS]
Help!
Somebody help me!
Help me!
[SCREAMS]
[SCREAMING]
[THUNDER]
Well, a miss as good as a mile, I always say.
And if one of those trees crashes through
It might just knock the whole...
Look, any tree on this side of the house
Will fall away from us, so just relax.
But I think I'd better go back aboard.
Don't think I'm not grateful for your hospitality.
I am.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Thorne.
Your ship is safe.
Please, stay here with me.
Why?
You scared or lonesome?
Both.
I'll take a rain check on it.
Thorne.
You can't leave.
No one opens that gate after dark.
Well, who's going to stop me?
You?
With this.
No one opens that gate at night.
[SHREWS CHATTERING]
Look, I don't ask questions because it's
Against my principles.
But wouldn't you like to explain that?
All right.
Sit down and I will.
Give me the gun.
Not very becoming, anyway.
Do you believe in fairy tales?
Well, I'm a little old for that sort of thing,
But what did you have in mind?
Well I'll tell you about one.
A true fairy tale, and you're right in the middle of it.
Oh?
Have you ever heard of a shrew?
As in "Taming of the"...
No, the animal.
Radford called them sorex soricidae
When he showed you one.
Well, then shrew must be the common name
For those cute little animals.
Cute?
That's the last word you can use to describe
Those little monsters.
They're the most horrible animals
On the face of the earth.
As father told you, they breed within three weeks after birth.
Their lifespan is one year.
Yeah, I know what your father told me.
But what's that got to do with me opening that gate?
There are 200 or 300 giant shrews out there.
Monsters weighing between
50 and 100 pounds.
50 to 100... wait a minute.
You must be kidding.
I'm definitely not kidding.
That's as big as a full grown wolf.
And what's more, they are beginning to starve.
No wonder you didn't want me to go out there.
Thanks for saving my skin.
And I'm sorry I had to threaten you with a gun.
But I didn't know how else to stop you.
It was very effective.
But all you had to do was tell me about them.
I hoped I wouldn't have to.
But you changed everything when you started to leave.
And I had to stop you some way.
You say there's 200 or 300 out there?
Ann.
That's right, Captain Thorne.
And if you'd stuck with your row boat
And played captain instead of trying to play detective,
You wouldn't have to worry about how many are out there,
Would you?
That's enough, Jerry.
What's wrong, Ann?
Thorne decided to leave.
To dissuade him I started to tell him about the shrews.
He might as well know the whole story as half of it.
I guess we're all a little jumpy, captain.
I'm sorry.
Six months ago we managed to isolate
The path to controlling size.
Two litters were born.
Six individuals kept for study.
They were about the size of buckshot at birth.
But the rate of growth was abnormal.
They continued to grow and grow.
They were mutants.
But they inherited all the negative characteristics
Of their breed.
Somehow they managed to escape.
About a month later we saw one of their offspring.
They were multiplying.
We did everything in the world to exterminate them,
But no apparent luck.
Then we haven't seen any since daylight blinds them and they
Forage only at night unless starving.
But the fact that two of them charged Ann and Jerry
At the gate last evening indicates
That their available food on the island is nearing depletion.
Then what, Doctor?
They will exterminate each other.
It will take a couple days.
And what do we do during that time?
Stay indoors and wait until it's over.
I guess some wires blew down on the transformer.
I'm sorry.
I'll get some lamps.
Mario.
Mario.
Si, senor?
There's a lantern in the pantry.
Light it and bring it in here.
Radford, light all the candles you can find.
All right, I will.
Where's the generator?
Outside.
Can't get at it at night.
Here, let me help.
A lantern will give you all the light you need.
I will join you shortly, Jerry.
[THUNDER]
Well, Jerry, I felt she was sincere
And made sense from her standpoint.
Wanting her father to leave the island with her makes sense?
It'd be much better for the project
If I went with her for a few days.
As a matter of fact, I think
I'll talk to Doctor about that.
That might be the answer.
And another thing, I don't take much to this Thorne Sherman.
He looks to me like the type that would try anything.
That left handed dinner invitation.
That was just to keep me here until after dark, wasn't it?
I wanted you here tonight.
I thought something terrible was going to happen.
Do you still feel the same way about it?
Not as much.
Not since you're here and know everything.
[SHREWS CHATTERING]
[HORSE NEIGHING]
I love an open fire, don't you?
Mm-hmm.
The wind has a lonesome sound, doesn't it?
Sure does.
Back in Sweden we don't have a wind this strong.
You're a strange man, Thorne.
I never met anyone like you.
Oh?
You seem so disinterested in everything.
Aren't you the least bit curious?
Don't you wonder about the unusual things around here?
The guns, the fence, shattered windows, my accent, anything?
I'll tell you something.
I'm only interested in anything that concerns me,
Then I do something about it.
[HORSE NEIGHING]
You're going to sail with me tomorrow whether your father
[INAUDIBLE].
[HORSE NEIGHING]
Thorne, no!
Father!
Rad!
Out there.
I don't think he was going out, Jerry.
I couldn't take a chance.
He's fool enough to.
Don't be stupid.
I had no intentions of going out there and opening
That gate unless somebody needed it.
Did you hear it, Doctor?
Sounded like a human voice.
I was thinking of Rook.
It was the livestock.
The shrews got into the barn.
What was it, father?
The livestock.
Did Mario forget to bar those doors?
No.
I put them in the barn myself.
They couldn't get through the wood doors.
They dug through the dirt floor.
Let me ask you something, Doctor.
How could you expose all our lives, yourself included,
With those things out there?
All you had to do was get the Coast Guard or the Navy
To come in here and burn them out.
Those things got loose...
Any unusual experiment can produce unusual results.
That's why I chose this island.
It's isolated.
Miles of open water in any direction.
Our project is privately financed.
It's not a product for the government or military.
And the world is no danger.
This species does not swim.
And as far as the shrews are concerned,
This island is their world.
Very soon, right here on this island,
There's going to be a miniature reproduction
Of an overpopulated world.
And you'll see the importance of what we're working to avoid.
I'm not concerned about all this theory.
What I'm concerned about is our lives.
There'll be ample time to panic when they run out of food
And go on a 24 hour forage.
How do you know they haven't already?
That's possible.
Their main diet has been small animals on the island.
That source could have been depleted 18 or 20 hours ago.
And that's why they went after the livestock.
There's still some food on this island
Before they reach the crisis.
Where?
No worry about them digging in here.
The floors are tile.
But the walls aren't, Doctor.
They're adobe.
Our safest bet would be on that boat.
You may be right.
You can reach your boat in daylight.
The shrews will gorge themselves on livestock.
That will keep them lethargic for several hours.
There's no sense looking at the dark side.
And there's no sense minimizing a serious situation.
It leaves you completely unprepared to cope with it.
Now we certainly can't make it tonight.
That's out of the question.
Maybe tomorrow.
I have it.
We'll get some sleep tonight, but we'll
Have a watch, an hour and a half apiece.
Doctor, you go first, and then Radford, Mario, Jerry,
And then me.
Shutter all the windows.
Make sure they're locked good and tight.
Check all these walls.
Come now.
No, I think I'll stay here by the fire.
I feel safer.
I couldn't stand it in that room alone.
All right.
As you wish.
But try to get some sleep.
I will.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
Senor Farrell, it is Mario.
You are next to make the patrol, no?
(SLURRING) Sure,
Mario, come on in.
Been waiting for you to finish.
I must have dozed off.
You kind of startled me.
Sit down.
Here.
Have a drink.
It'll help you to relax.
Gracias, senor.
Sit down.
Rest a while.
You just checked every room in the house, didn't you?
Si.
Fine.
You're a good man, Mario.
A man that can be trusted.
You know what I've been thinking about, Mario?
Ann and that captain.
You and me.
Imagine an intelligent girl like her going
For a common sea tramp like him.
I know why.
You do too.
In case anything goes wrong she's
Looking out for her own hide.
That's why I keep thinking about you and me.
Anything goes wrong, we're going to outlast them all.
[THUNDER]
I'm going to trust you to take my turn
At patrolling the house.
But when you finish, don't wake the captain.
Come back here and get me.
I'll probably feel good enough by then to take his turn.
OK, Mario?
Si.
OK.
[SHREWS SQUEAKING]
Senor, it is Mario.
Mario.
Come on in.
What is it?
[SPEAKING SPANISH]
A shrew in the cellar?
Si.
I hear him [INAUDIBLE] down there.
Well how did he get in?
The [INAUDIBLE] the kitchen window.
But I close it off.
He went down there.
Why should he go down there?
The food for the [INAUDIBLE].
I [INAUDIBLE].
They love it.
Well did you tell Jerry?
No, senor.
He [INAUDIBLE] your turn next.
Here is [INAUDIBLE].
We kill him, no?
Yeah.
Ann.
Ann, wake up.
A shrew got in.
It's all right.
He's down in the cellar.
Now, we're going down after him.
But I don't want you to let anybody
Open that door until I tell you to.
You understand?
Good girl.
OK.
Open it just a crack.
Open it.
Hold on to it.
OK.
Take that side.
Mario?
[SPEAKING SPANISH]
You see anything?
I see where he was.
I do not see where he is.
[SPEAKING SPANISH]
Si, senor.
I will be careful.
[GUNSHOT]
[SPEAKING SPANISH]
Here, let me fix that.
[SHREW SQUEAKING]
[GUNSHOT]
You all right down there?
Doctor, get down here quick.
Mario!
He... he's dead.
Dead?
I got this on him right away.
He couldn't have bled to death.
Might as well let go of it.
Won't do him any good now.
What could have killed him?
I'm not certain.
Until the autopsy.
Hemotoxic syndrome.
I'm afraid so.
We'll know after pathology.
Doctor, that's not the same animal you showed me.
That's a monster.
As I said, they are mutants.
In controlling the size factor, we
Seem to have crossed some of the other characteristics.
Well, you certainly did a good job of it.
I've known that for some time, Captain.
Would you please give me a hand with Mario?
Radford, bring up the animal.
Extremely high poison content in the shrew's saliva.
Mm-hmm.
Now compare it with this.
Careful count isn't necessary.
Any indication the same poison in Mario's blood
Will give you the answer.
Yes, you're right.
Look, Ann.
Brooding about it's not going to do any good.
Now why don't you try to think of something else?
Tell me, what do you do around here?
Are you a scientist?
I'm a zoologist.
Oh?
That's the study of animal life, isn't it?
Well, do you specialize?
What do you specialize in?
[INAUDIBLE].
I had a hand in this too.
I'm partly to blame.
[SHREWS CHATTERING]
[INAUDIBLE].
If we ever get off this island, I'll
Never have anything to do with it again.
What will you do?
Live normally, like normal women do.
May seem a little dull after the life I've been living.
But I'd rather dull and alive than excited and...
I'd take a dull alive woman every time.
Say, Thorne.
The autopsy has proved what we suspected.
Several weeks ago I concocted the most virulent poison
I could with the materials I had at hand.
I put it out as bait.
Mario was killed by poison.
Doctor, I wonder if you thought the system of the sorex
Enabled them to assimilate that poison.
It remained in the salivary glands of their jaws.
Isn't that wonderful?
I am sorry.
Of course I always speak from the clinical point of view.
Well, don't you have something to counteract that poison?
Once Mario was bitten I'm afraid there's nothing anyone
Could have done.
This indicates that we cannot afford to get even so much
As a scratch from these animals.
They're more poisonous than snakes.
What, do you think they're all effected?
Best way to find out is let them all
Bite you and see which bites you die after.
We might just all get that chance, Jerry.
You included.
Doctor, I've closed all the doors in the house.
I suggest we do the same thing with this hall and this lab.
It'll cut down the chances of getting
In the front of the house.
I think if we keep a close watch on those walls and windows
In there, we might make it until daybreak.
The walls are two feet thick.
Do you think they have a chance to dig in?
Of course there's a chance.
Anywhere that plaster's off, that adobe's as soft as mush
Where that rain hit it.
[SHREW SQUEAKING]
It's not a bad idea, Doctor.
But here's another possibility, Doctor.
It's very light out.
It's going to be daylight soon.
We take the shrew that killed Mario
And throw it over the fence and use it for bait.
If they show up for it, of course the run for the boat's
Out.
But if they don't, then I'll go down
And have Rook lay too with the lighter.
Then I'll return to the bend in the trail
And give you the all clear signal.
Sounds fine, Captain.
Good, then you explain it to the rest.
Yes, I will.
Well, the bait's been out there 20 minutes.
Nothing's touched it.
Even the wind has gone down.
Isn't that wonderful?
I'm afraid it's not over, my dear.
It's just a lull.
There'll be a lot more.
He's right.
I'll be back at the bend shortly.
Now you watch for my signal.
You can't go alone.
I'll go with him.
Not you, father.
You haven't even fired a gun.
Take Rad or Jerry.
Sure, I'll go.
And you'll be sure of getting a signal.
Don't shoot that gun unless you have to.
We've only got 20 rounds all together.
I know that as well as you do.
Sherman.
You stay away from her.
Do you have that gun pointed at me?
Right at the middle of your back.
Look, we got enough problems without worrying about Ann.
I'm telling you, stay away from her
Or when the shrews get through with you,
They won't even find a buckshot.
[SHREWS CHATTERING]
Hey, Rook!
Hey, Rook!
Rook!
[WHISTLES] Where's the skiff?
I'll follow that check line.
I've got to find him.
Since last night you won't find much of him.
Would you shut up?
I'm not going back.
You what?
I'm staying here.
All right.
You suit yourself.
But if I were you, I'd swim out to that boat.
Can't swim.
Then stay here.
Wait a minute.
You've got to give me a gun.
Give you a gun?
Sherman, wait!
This is the gun we had on the boat.
They don't leave much, do they?
Sherman, we've got to make a deal for...
[SHREWS SQUEAKING]
What is it?
Shh.
They've been trailing us on both sides.
Where?
I didn't see anything.
Look, Sherman, you've got to give me a gun.
All right.
Whatever you do, don't you run.
And you stay in front of me because I don't trust you.
[SHREWS CHATTERING]
They're coming!
Open the gate!
Open it!
[GUNSHOT]
Open the gate!
Open the gate!
Open up!
Let him in!
Jerry, open the door!
[GUNSHOT]
[INAUDIBLE].
Sherman!
The shrews were out there!
I couldn't take a chance!
[MEN YELLING]
For heaven's sakes.
Doctor, stop him!
All right, didn't he have it coming or didn't he?
What happened out there?
Oh, nothing much.
Jerry just tried to kill me twice in the last five minutes.
Rook came ashore last night.
He's dead.
This is all that was left.
Won't do us any good.
It's got no ammo.
I'm deeply sorry, Captain.
I wish he had followed your orders.
Look, Doctor, you casually mentioned animals.
You didn't explain to us what we were facing out there.
You have every right to feel the way that you do.
My mistake was only mine.
It was one of judgment.
I didn't know about the hurricane.
I didn't anticipate the effect it would have on the shrews.
I thought the house would be safe through the crisis.
How could you expose your own daughter?
How could you expose Ann to that?
She was going to leave last week, but the boat didn't come.
I need a drink.
Anybody else care for one?
I could use some coffee.
I'll make some.
Thank you, Ann.
Cream and sugar?
[SHREW CHATTERING]
Oh, my leg!
[GUNSHOTS]
Slam the door!
You all right, Doctor?
He just ripped my trousers, that's all.
Are you sure that's all?
I'm completely aware of it, Doctor.
I'll kill them!
[GUNSHOTS]
That was a stupid waste of ammunition.
Every one of them a clean miss.
There's still four of them in there.
How did they get in?
Through that kitchen window.
That rope must be rotten.
It's got him!
Radford!
He's dead.
Oh, no!
He recorded every symptom and reaction.
Right up to the moment of his death.
Jerry, tear down one of those drapes and cover him up.
Sure.
Sure.
Craigis will cover Ann and I'll cover him.
You'll cover me.
But who'll cover you?
Shut up.
We can get on [INAUDIBLE].
I told you to shut up.
Now you stop snivelling and think.
It'd take a tank to get us out of here.
Thorne!
There!
[SHREW SQUEAKING]
Won't take them long to dig around this.
You're right.
No telling where else they're digging too.
[GUNSHOTS]
Come on. [INAUDIBLE].
There's not enough stuff here to barricade those walls.
I'll tell you what, pile some of those crates up over there.
That roof's our last chance.
Help me, Doctor.
Find something light.
All right.
Here, [INAUDIBLE] Doctor.
Jerry, see if you can find some rope.
Doctor.
Yes?
Use these chemical drums as tanks.
Individual tanks.
Here, I'll show you.
Set it down now.
Slow.
All right.
All right?
Yeah.
It'll work.
It'll work.
But these drums are too tall for the base.
If the shrews don't push us over, the wind will.
Not if we lash them together.
Are there any more around here?
Only that one over there.
Have any [INAUDIBLE] chisels or hammers or anything
I could knock a hole in here and make [INAUDIBLE] pieces?
There are some tools over there in the corner.
Hey, here's another one.
Get that out there.
Hey, even better.
Give me a little more slack.
Get some rope and put it on that latch so we can [INAUDIBLE]
From the ground.
[SCREAMS]
[SHREW SHRIEKING]
Now hold this in.
All right.
All right.
We're all set.
Look, it's going to be rough, but we
Should be able to duck walk to the beach.
Where's Jerry?
There's a lot of them out there.
I can see them.
I'm not going.
Look, come down here!
That wind will blow you right off that roof.
I told you, I'm not going.
I'm staying here.
We've got to get him down here somehow.
Ann, see if you can coax him down here.
Jerry, Jerry please come down with us!
No.
Ann, they'll get you if you go out there.
Come down here, you fool!
Poor devil.
I hope he makes it.
We can't leave.
He's not responsible for himself.
We have to go now.
All right, Doctor.
Now hold it up.
Everybody ready?
I'm going to open that gate.
Ready.
Ready.
OK, here they come.
Hold on.
Hold on.
[SCREAMS]
Ann, what's the matter?
Your side's dragging.
You want to rest?
You tired?
[SPEAKING SWEDISH]
What'd you say?
She says she's all right.
She's keeping her eyes closed.
All right.
Keep your eyes closed.
They can't get at you through the slit.
This empty drum is too heavy for her.
I can barely hold up my side.
I'll be all right in a minute.
All right.
You walk.
I'll drag for a while.
Listen.
Don't let their head get under.
They'll flip us over.
[GUNSHOTS]
[SCREAMING]
[SCREAMS]
He got my foot!
Check your foot!
No, my foot is free but he got my boot.
Is there a scratch?
No.
Not a mark.
[GUNSHOT]
Keep moving.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Thorne, I don't think I...
What?
Sand!
We're at sand!
Sand, we're close!
We'll hit the water soon.
Doesn't sound like they're following us anymore.
We'd better walk deeper.
I'm about drowned out.
OK, let's swim for it.
OK.
[SPEAKING SWEDISH] We are safe, aren't we?
I mean, the storm.
Oh, sure.
She rode out the first half all right,
And that's always the roughest.
Anyway, riding an anchor out will give me a chance
To learn a little bit more about that Swedish accent.
In 24 hours, there'll be one shrew left on the island.
And he'll be dead of starvation.
An excellent example of overpopulation.
Well, you know something, Doctor?
What's that?
I'm not going to worry about overpopulation just yet.
Ah, Satan, Mon Cher.
You are late, yes, you are.
Still looking for your girlfriend, huh?
Mademoiselle Dandelo has found another.
You will never see her again.
But don't you worry. There will be others.
Eh, madame?
Yes?
Yes, who is this?
This is François Delambre speaking.
Helene? How are you, Helene, dear?
What can I do for you?
François, I've killed Andre.
- I need your help.
- Now, look, Helene, it's past midnight.
I've had a hard day. I love you both dearly, but this sort of a joke...
It's true.
I've killed Andre.
You killed... But...
Please help me.
Call the police and... Come quickly.
I just can't...
Helene.
Helene?
- Yes?
- Monsieur François? Gaston.
I tried to call you.
Something terrible has happened.
A man is dead.
His head is under the press.
And I saw a woman running...
Running away.
Yes, Gaston.
It looked...
I think it was Madame Delambre.
You stay there, Gaston.
I'll get the police immediately.
Anthenium Club?
Is Inspector Charas still there?
Yes, thank you.
Yes, I'll wait.
Check.
Sorry to interrupt, sir.
There's a call.
Thank you.
- Hello?
- Inspector?
This is François Delambre. You may remember, we met a few times at the club.
It's just... I'm sorry to call you so late, but, well, I'm in terrible trouble.
- Trouble, monsieur?
- My sister-in-law just phoned.
She'd killed her husband, my brother... My brother, Andre.
What? At our factory,
Delambre Freres.
Our night watchman called too.
There is a body.
Where are you now,
Mr. Delambre?
I'll pick you up in a few minutes.
Good-bye. You'll have to excuse me.
- Inspector, Helene lives just...
- No, we ought to look here first.
- But I've got to talk to her.
- Please, I've already sent a man.
She'll be all right.
It's Andre.
- How can we raise the press?
- I'll do it for you.
Would you like us to get one of your men?
I'll be all right.
Whenever you're ready, monsieur.
Dead about 30 minutes.
- Is the downstroke fast?
- No.
About the same.
- No danger of it coming down again?
- No.
It's been set for 50 tons.
- Impact zero.
- Zero?
Yes. That means level with the bed.
- It's never been set that way. Never.
- Oh?
That would squeeze the metal to nothing.
It's been set for single strokes too.
She didn't know how to operate the press.
- Are you sure this is your brother?
- Well, he...
There was a long scar on his left leg. War wound.
- I'll... Would you mind?
- Doctor.
I can't believe it.
Can you think of any reason why she would do such a thing?
None. Absolutely none.
They were completely happy together.
They have a wonderful little boy,
Philippe, whom they both adore.
Helene was always so gentle.
It just doesn't make sense.
Andre loved two things, his family and his work.
It's impossible.
- What is it, monsieur?
- The stroke count.
- That's the stroke count.
- I don't understand.
Whoever did this to Andre...
It reads two.
- They did it twice!
- Twice?
Oui, monsieur.
I heard the press come down two times.
- Good evening, monsieur.
- Good evening.
- Is it true?
- Doctor.
Yes.
- Did Helene...
- Listen, I can't believe it.
Inspector, this is our family physician, Dr. Ejoute.
- Inspector Charas.
- Your man called me, so I came.
- How is she?
- Quite calm now.
Almost in a state of euphoria, of relief, as though she's happy about it.
Is she insane, Doctor?
Helene Delambre could've never killed her husband.
It's impossible.
Unless she is or was insane.
- Did she tell you anything?
- Nothing, except she killed him.
And how... No, there's nothing in her that could make her do that.
Why, Inspector,
I've known her all her life.
I even delivered her.
She and Andre were devoted to each other.
- Where is Madame Delambre?
- In the living room.
François, I'm sorry I called you.
As you see, I could've called the police myself. I'm all right now.
Helene, my dear, you know if there's anything I can do...
You're the police?
Inspector Charas, madame.
Helene, what's going on?
Why do you say you killed Andre? Why?
It's all right, François.
Everything's all right now.
Madame, would you tell us what happened?
Of course, monsieur.
I killed my husband,
Andre Delambre, about half an hour ago in the hydraulic press shed.
You understand the gravity of the crime.
You say you killed your husband.
That means you murdered him.
I killed Andre, yes.
- Why?
- I cannot answer that question.
- How did you kill him?
- With the hydraulic press.
- How do you operate it?
- First you put on the main switch.
Then you set the stroke to whatever tonnage you want.
You set the stroke to maximum, that is, level with the table, or zero.
Then you press the release button.
It's the red one.
You mean you put your husband under the press?
No, Inspector.
He did that himself.
He put his head and his arm under the press?
- Yes.
- Why?
I cannot answer that question.
Coffee, Inspector?
Yes, ple... Gentlemen, would you wait for me outside, please?
Yes, of course.
No, thank you.
Now, madame, you were happy with your husband?
There were no mistresses.
I had no lovers.
We were both very happy.
- That is the truth.
- Then why did you kill him?
I wish to help you all I can, Inspector, but I cannot answer that question.
You pressed the button and it was all over.
Yes.
- Why did you press it twice?
- Oh, it was only once.
The stroke count read two.
A machine cannot lie.
Oh, yes. Yes, it was twice.
I... I was wrong.
- I did it twice.
- Why?
Perhaps you will wait, madame?
Of course, Inspector.
What would you advise, medically, Doctor?
Rest. Maybe in a day or two, her state of mind will improve.
Very well. You understand the lady is under surveillance.
I'll arrange for one of our nurses to take charge of her.
Of course. Thank you very much, Inspector.
You can rely on me.
Well, what do you think?
Would you show me your brother's laboratory?
Yes, of course.
This way.
This is the work of a madman!
There was over $200,000 worth of special equipment here.
Andre was always so careful of everything.
Special equipment?
What was all this for?
I don't know. It could have been anything, any one of a dozen ideas.
He... Well... When he'd develop something, he would show it to me.
He was working on an idea for the Air Ministry.
Perhaps they'd know.
I imagine electronics is a profitable field these days.
Yes, very. We own the business jointly.
We both have more money than we know what to do with.
They had no outside interests.
None, I'm sure of it.
That's why it doesn't make sense.
You're very attached to both of them, aren't you?
Yes. Inspector, what does all this mean?
I have no idea.
She would tell me nothing except that she'd killed him.
There appears to be no motive, no reason except insanity.
And even that leaves several important questions unanswered.
Perhaps he committed suicide.
Well, if he did, why does she say she killed him?
And if it was suicide, why such a clumsy method?
And why involve your wife?
And she was there.
She could hang for this.
Poor Philippe.
What will I tell him?
How does one tell a child?
If I may suggest, you could look after the boy for a while.
What's gonna happen to her?
We'll keep her under observation for the moment.
There's plenty of time.
Did your brother ever experiment with animals?
Never.
- Or insects?
- Insects? No.
That would be funny if...
No, Helene and Andre believed in the sacredness of life.
They wouldn't harm anything, not even a fly.
Lunch, madame.
Oh, I'm eating much too much.
At this rate,
I'll gain pounds.
- Can I get up today?
- Ask Dr. Ejoute, madame.
Every time I ask him, he says "Tomorrow."
You're coming along nicely.
The rest will do you good.
Is Inspector Charas coming today?
He did not say, madame.
I like him.
He's been very gentle.
I hope François brings that nice little boy today.
What is his name?
Philippe?
Yes, Philippe.
A nice boy.
They think I'm mad, don't they?
They never tell me what they think about.
Go away.
Go away!
- Is it bothering you?
- No. No, it doesn't bother me.
- I'll soon rid you of the pest.
- It's all right, Nurse Andersone.
Please leave it alone!
But, nurse!
Stop it, nurse.
Stop it!
Leave it alone!
Leave it alone!
- No! No!
- What is the matter?
- Let me look at that fly!
- You get back into bed!
- Please let me look at the fly!
- Back into bed.
Get out of my way!
Where is it? Where?
Oh. Oh, there.
Come on.
Come on, madame.
Come on.
Come on, madame.
- It's just a common housefly.
- Yes.
Perhaps it's symbolic of something deep in her subconscious, as her psychiatrist believes.
Mr. Delambre, do you think she's mad?
It's obvious, isn't it?
In spite of what the doctors think,
I believe Mrs. Delambre's mind is quite clear.
- Even when catching flies.
- How can you say that?
She must be mad.
What about Philippe?
She acts as if the boy were mine and not hers.
She may be trying to protect him.
- Perhaps she fears him or even hates him.
- That's impossible.
Helene couldn't hate anyone.
You must be out of your mind.
You're in love with her, aren't you?
- Yes.
- Then why didn't you marry her?
Because she loved my brother.
I don't think she ever noticed me.
I'm glad you're being honest with me.
You see, at first
I suspected you.
Me? Why should I do such a thing?
Motive one, for his wife. Motive two, to gain control of Delambre Electronics.
What do I care about motives?
Helene is in trouble and Andre's dead.
It's... It's like a nightmare.
I know now you had nothing to do with it, but I had to check for her sake.
I'm sorry, Inspector.
I'm a fool.
You've been so patient. Forgive me.
It's just...
I understand, monsieur.
It is I who should apologize. I have to pry into all sorts of personal things.
It's necessary, unfortunately.
Thank you for coming.
If there's anything
I can do to help, I will.
Did you discover what your brother was working on?
No. The Air Ministry scientists have been through all of his papers. Everything.
They didn't mean a thing to them.
We couldn't decipher the ashes.
Nothing there either.
Well, I've delayed all I can.
We've been quite patient with the lady.
I'm afraid I shall have to ask for a warrant tomorrow.
- The courts can decide.
- Tomorrow?
The charge can only be murder.
I'm sorry for you and the boy, but I cannot conceive of any verdict except guilty, or guilty but insane.
- Thank you, Yvette.
- Uncle?
- Yes, Philippe?
- When's Daddy coming home?
- Soon.
- Can I see Mommy again tomorrow?
- Yes.
- She's very sick, isn't she?
Yes, Philippe, she's very sick.
Do flies live a long time?
I don't know. Why?
Because I saw that fly
Mommy was looking for again.
I didn't know your mother was looking for one.
Oh, yes, she was.
It's grown quite a lot, but I recognized it, all right.
- Mmm, this is good.
- How did you recognize it?
Its head is white instead of black, and it has a funny sort of leg.
It was on your desk this morning.
Oh? I didn't notice it.
When did you first see that fly?
The day Daddy went away.
I had caught it, but Mommy made me let it go.
Then later she wanted me to find it again.
She changed her mind.
You know how women are.
Excuse me, Philippe.
I won't be a moment.
Inspector Charas.
Inspector Charas.
- Good evening, Nurse.
- Why, Mr. Delambre.
Inspector Charas told me about her relapse. How is she now?
Resting quietly, poor lady.
But monsieur...
The inspector told me that I might speak to her for a few moments alone.
- He knows I'm here.
- But he didn't say you were coming.
He has so much on his mind.
I won't be long.
Oh.
François, I didn't hear you.
You look tired.
Of course.
Just the office, you know.
You shouldn't work so hard.
- How are you?
- I'm fine. I feel all right.
I'm glad you came.
I wanted to ask you something.
Of course, Helene.
Anything at all.
How long do flies live?
Oh, I don't know.
I think a month, two months.
The fly you were looking for was in my study today.
- Did... Did you kill it?
- No.
You have it with you?
Give it to me.
- Please, give it to me!
- I haven't got it here.
Oh.
- You know now.
- What is this all about?
You haven't got it, or you wouldn't ask.
Yes, I have it. It's locked in my desk.
Tell me what happened.
No, never.
Andre wouldn't want me to.
I know you're not mad.
I want the truth.
Either you tell me, or I'm going to give it to Charas.
You swear you have it?
Yes.
If I tell you, will you promise to destroy it?
- I can't do that until I know...
- Then I can't tell you anything.
For your own sake you've got to tell me.
You're all right, or you can be all right perhaps.
As soon as they examine it they'll know, and they'll know you're not insane.
No!
For Philippe's sake,
François, I beg you.
Don't you see? I was pretending to be mad for Philippe's sake.
Better that I should be declared insane, than he should be the son of a woman hanged for murder.
I want to know.
Either you tell me now, or I give the fly to Charas.
If I tell you, will you tell them?
I only want to help you.
I can only do that through them.
Yes, I would tell them.
Poor François.
Call Charas then.
I can't tell it twice.
So long as you'll kill the fly.
You promise?
Yes.
This is not a confession.
Although I killed my husband,
I am not a murderess.
I simply carried out his last wish.
A few months ago...
Who's a ticklish boy?
Why don't you pick on somebody your own size?
Andre! What a pleasant surprise.
Hi, Daddy. Are you gonna play with us?
Later, Philippe. I've got to borrow your mother for a moment.
But I won't be long, I promise.
I'll tell you what.
Before you go to bed,
I'll play with you, all right?
- Promise?
- Promise.
- All right then. I'll play with Dandelo.
- Good.
Be gentle with her, Philippe.
Come on. I've got to show you something.
But, Andre, we don't see you for days on end.
- Then suddenly you expect...
- Don't argue with me. Come on.
But...
I'd no idea you'd made so many changes.
- A completely new line of research.
- Let me guess.
- The permanent battery.
- Mmm-mmm.
Not the portable reactor?
I'll show you, but there must be absolutely no mention of this made to anyone.
- Of course.
- It's much too important.
Helene, you're the first to see a miracle.
- Remember this?
- Oh, of course.
Our wedding present from my devoted and very rich Aunt Bess.
Mmm-hmm. The family heirloom.
Hurry, put them on.
Now watch the box.
You can take your goggles off now, darling.
It's gone.
Come on.
- It's the same one.
- Mmm-hmm.
- Have you turned magician?
- In a way.
For a split second, an infinitesimal part of a second, this was disintegrated.
For one little moment it no longer existed, only atoms traveling through space at the speed of light.
Then here, a moment later, integrated again into the shape of an ashtray.
Oh, you're joking.
Doesn't sound possible, does it? But it is true.
It is impossible. You're playing some joke on me.
Take television.
What happens?
A string of electrons, sound and picture impulses, are transmitted through wires or the air.
The TV camera is the disintegrator.
Your set unscrambles, or integrates, the electrons back into pictures and sound.
- Yes, but this is different.
- Why?
Well, because it's impossible!
Fifty years ago, if my father were told he could sit in Montreal, and watch a World Series in New York the exact time it was happening, he'd say it was impossible.
- This is the same principle exactly.
- But it's not the same.
- This is solid.
- Oh, no, it's not.
To your touch, maybe it is.
In reality, it's billions of atoms, which we believe are only a series of electrical impulses.
Uh...
You actually did this?
It's no trick?
No.
I can transport matter, anything, at the speed of light perfectly.
Oh, of course this is only a crude beginning.
But I've been lucky enough to stumble on the most important discovery since man sawed off the end of a tree trunk and found the wheel.
The disintegrator-integrator will completely change life as we know it.
Think what it'll mean.
Food. Anything.
Even humans will go through one of these devices.
No need for cars or railways or airplanes, even spaceships. We'll set up matter transmitting-receiving stations throughout the world, and later, the universe.
There'll never be a need of famine.
Surpluses can be sent instantaneously at almost no cost anywhere.
Humanity need never want or fear again.
I'm a very fortunate man.
I'm a very fortunate woman.
I hope you don't transmit me.
I wouldn't want to come out like this.
What do you mean?
Well, it doesn't matter, does it, Andre?
Andre.
It's perfect.
Everything checks.
It's perfect.
Perfect.
Dandelo!
What's the matter? You hungry?
There we are.
That's it.
You won't feel a thing,
Dandelo.
And tomorrow you'll be the most famous cat in all the world.
Dandelo!
Dandelo.
Hello?
Oh, François, how nice to hear you.
Important?
You're getting married.
No.
No, not yet.
I think I like it this way.
It's just that there's no hurry.
Is Andre there?
Andre?
I've seen him about two hours in the last two weeks.
He eats and sleeps in his lab.
He won't talk or answer the telephone.
- I don't want to hear one more word!
- I don't want to!
- You're going to eat your dinner now!
- I don't want to!
Philippe's acting like a juvenile delinquent. Dandelo's disappeared.
I've even got to go to Professor
Augier's this evening alone.
You know how he is, Helene.
It's just until he solves his problem, whatever it is. Be patient.
How you men stick together.
Anything I can do? All right, François.
I'll tell him if I see him.
I gotta run now, François.
Good-bye.
Well!
Where have you been?
Listen, darling, I'm sorry about the last couple of weeks.
I had a little setback, but it's all right now.
- Oh, I didn't mind.
- Hmm?
Well, maybe just a little.
Call Augier and cancel out.
We're going to celebrate by ourselves.
Wonderful.
I didn't want to go anyway.
François just called about some special equipment. He's sending it now.
Good. By the time you've changed, I'll be ready.
- Changed?
- I've got tickets for the ballet.
- The ballet!
- We'll eat at the Tour d'Eiffel first.
- Oh, wonderful!
- Now hurry.
We'll finish a delightful evening with reintegrated champagne.
Finish?
- Well, not quite.
- Oh? What then?
What do you suggest?
You're in an unscientific mood.
You don't approve?
I didn't say that.
Will the champagne be as good as ever?
Exactly the same, bubble for bubble.
Here.
- The label's perfect!
- Of course!
Oh, it's so cold!
And it'll stay that way until
I show you something else.
Oh?
No, Andre, don't!
It might not work. I won't allow it!
- It'll be all right.
- Andre, please!
Put your goggles on, darling.
It's astounding!
It works!
I test-ran it this morning. It's all right.
You've succeeded completely.
It's unbelievable.
We'll have to wait and see.
I'll know for sure in a few weeks.
- I don't understand.
- To see if it suffers from ill effects.
- Oh.
- If it's alive in, say, a month, then we'll pronounce the experiment successful.
May I look after him?
It's still a her, but you can.
For one whole month she's mine.
Don't kill her with overfeeding.
It's a little frightening, isn't it?
Yes.
The first live experiment was disastrous... Dandelo.
Dandelo?
Andre, how could you?
She disintegrated perfectly but never reappeared. I don't know why, even now.
I redesigned the projecting device, and now it's perfect.
Where's she gone?
Into space, in a stream of cat atoms.
It'd be funny if life weren't so sacred.
Andre, promise me one thing.
No more experiments with animals.
I promise. No more experiments with animals.
It's frightening.
It's like playing God.
God gives us intelligence to uncover the wonders of nature.
Without the gift, nothing is possible.
Oh, Andre, I get so scared sometimes.
The suddenness of our age, electronics, rockets,
Earth satellites, supersonic flight, and now this.
Oh, it's not so much who invents them, it's the fact they exist.
But you're not frightened of TV or radio or X-rays or electricity, or that the Earth is round.
No, but everything's going so fast.
I'm... I'm just not ready to take it all in.
It's... It's all so quick.
Just do like Philippe does.
Accept them as part of our normal life.
They're facts, wonderful facts.
Which brings me back to the champagne.
I love you so much, Andre.
It's wonderful being married to you.
And to you, my love.
You're the healthiest guinea pig in the whole world.
Andre!
- You'll catch cold.
- Not today.
- What are you doing?
- Oh, just looking at the sky.
- Looking at God, perhaps.
- You're a strange man, Andre.
So precise and practical, and yet so...
- I don't quite know how to put it.
- So aware of the infinite?
The more I know, the more sure I am I know so little.
The eternal paradox.
You said you were frightened by progress.
I'm filled with the wonder of it.
- Spring will soon be here.
- I like spring the best.
All life growing, renewing itself.
- It's fantastic to be alive.
- How do you mean?
Oh, I don't know.
It's just...
I'm just so happy to be alive, that's all.
So am I.
Would you marry me again if you had your time over?
I think so.
Well, I've got a lot to do.
- Oh, François is coming to lunch.
- Oh?
Bring him down to the lab.
We'll show him now.
Shall I call Professor Augier and the Air Ministry scientists too?
Now, there's no hurry.
I... I don't even know how or why parts of it work yet.
It's too important.
It's too impossible.
Poor François.
He'll never believe it.
Don't stay out too long, darling.
You look tired.
The last thing I am is tired.
And we're finishing with crepes suzette.
What's all the celebration about?
I'm only coming for lunch.
- Andre wants to show you something.
- In the lab?
- Mmm-hmm.
- What is it? Flat screen?
It's better.
No more questions. Come on.
I've only been invited into the laboratory three times.
Each time I came out with a potential fortune.
Oh, dear. We won't see him for lunch.
I see what you mean.
His writing gets worse and worse.
Mommy! Mommy!
Where are you?
Coming, Philippe.
Yes, darling?
- I got something to show you.
- I have something to show you.
I caught such a funny-looking fly.
You want to see it?
Let it go. You know your father disapproves of you catching insects.
But this isn't like any other fly I've ever seen.
It has a funny white head and sort of white leg.
Now, you let it go at once.
Go along. Do as you're told. Go on.
Look at all that dirt you brought in.
Best fly I ever caught.
- Was there anything else, madame?
- No, thank you. Good night.
Shall I leave something for the master?
Didn't touch a bite of his dinner.
Oh?
I fetched up his tray about an hour ago.
It was still outside the door.
Had his favorite pastry on it too.
Never mind. He probably didn't hear you knock. I'll see if he wants anything.
Thank you.
Good night, madame.
Good night, Emma.
Andre? Andre, I'm going to bed now.
Is there anything you want?
Andre!
"Helene,
I've had some trouble."
Trouble?
Andre, what's the matter?
Answer me.
"I'm counting on you not to lose your nerve, for only you can help me."
"I've had a serious accident."
"But I'm not in danger at the moment,"
"although it's a matter of life or death."
Andre!
"It's no good calling to me or saying anything."
"I can't answer.
I can't speak."
"You've got to do exactly and very carefully what I tell you."
"Knock three times to show you understand and agree,"
"then fetch me a bowl of milk laced with rum."
Bowl of milk? Andre!
- Anything I can do, madame?
- No. No, loan manage.
Go back to bed, Emma.
Good night, madame.
Ah!
"When you knock,
I'll open the door."
"Walk over to my desk and put the milk on it."
"Then go into the other lab and try to find a fly."
A fly?
"You will easily recognize it.
Its head is white."
Philippe-
Oh, Andre.
"Don't hurt it.
Just give it to me."
"Before you come in, you must promise to obey me implicitly."
"Do not look at me.
Talking is useless. I cannot answer."
"Knock three times to show
I have your promise."
"My life is in your hands."
You can depend on me, darling.
It's not in here.
If you can't talk, knock.
Knock once for "yes" and twice for "no."
Do you understand?
We'll find the fly tomorrow.
I promise.
Just as soon as it's light,
I'll start looking.
Now, why don't you go to bed?
I'll help you.
No one will see you. I promise.
Philippe caught a fly this morning.
He said its head was white.
I didn't see it.
I made him let it go.
"Come back in morning.
Will type explanation."
"Need you fresh and strong tomorrow.
Poor darling. Sorry."
I'm all right now, darling.
Don't worry.
I'll find that fly.
Do you need anything tonight?
Darling, please try and get some sleep.
Good night, darling.
Andre.
"Remember the ashtray experiment?
"I've had a similar accident."
"I transmitted myself successfully yesterday morning."
"But in the second experiment, a fly which I did not notice"
"was in the disintegrator with me."
"When we integrated again, our atoms were mixed."
"Now my only hope is to find the fly."
"I've got to go through the machine once more and pray our atoms untangle."
"If you can't find it,
I'll have to destroy myself."
Can I come back in?
Don't worry, Andre. I'll find that fly.
It can't be far away.
But you mustn't talk about destroying yourself. You mustn't.
I'll call Professor Augier and the other scientists. They can help you. I...
Don't be angry, Andre.
I only thought that...
Promise me that you won't do anything.
Let me see your face.
I won't be afraid.
All right.
All right, Andre.
All right.
- Flies, madame?
- Yes. Close the windows.
- Catch flies?
- I told you, Emma.
A fly escaped from the lab.
We've got to find it.
- It's got a white head.
- Mommy!
I don't know what's gotten into this house.
Mommy!
- Look. I caught lots of them.
- Where is it?
- Are you sure you caught it?
- Oh, the white one.
No. I haven't caught it yet.
I told you to find that fly.
I'm sorry, Philippe, darling, but you've got to find it.
The white one, only the white one.
- Gotcha!
- You fool!
I said catch them!
Don't kill them!
I'm sorry, Emma.
Please, just catch them.
Madame, there's one in the hall.
Where? Where is it?
Oh, it's no good, Emma.
We'll never find it.
Philippe?
Make some supper, Emma, would you?
I'm sorry.
It's... It's just that...
Come on, Philippe.
Go and get washed up for dinner.
There's a good boy.
All right, Mommy.
Oh, Philippe.
I see it.
Don't move.
Go and get some sugar, quick.
Give me the sugar.
And close those doors.
Now, stay back.
Got him!
- Good boy, Philippe. Careful now.
- Let me see.
Oh, no.
It's in back of the curtain!
Oh, don't harm it.
Don't hurt it.
Oh, God, don't let it get out.
You try and keep it behind the curtain.
I'll get it from outside.
Oh, no. Oh, God...
Please, God, don't let it...
Don't cry, Mommy.
Please don't cry.
We'll catch it tomorrow.
Don't worry.
Please don't worry.
Andre.
We caught the fly today, but it escaped out into the garden.
I'll look for it again tomorrow.
You eat. I'll read this here.
"if you had caught the fly, you would not be reading this."
"I know you will never catch it now.
It's hopeless."
"There are things man should never experiment with."
"Now I must destroy everything, all evidence, even myself."
"No one must ever know what
I discovered. It's too dangerous."
"I've thought of a way.
It's not easy, but I need your help."
Andre!
You can still reason, Andre.
You've got no right to destroy yourself.
You mustn't think about it.
You've still got your intelligence.
You're still a man with a soul.
You've no right to destroy yourself.
We'll find that fly tomorrow.
I know we will.
Think easy.
But you've got to give me more time.
Why?
Why won't you wait?
Then see Professor Augier and the other scientists. They'll help you.
They'll do anything to help you.
I've another idea.
You remember the ashtray experiment?
Go through again.
It worked before.
Why?
Please try it.
You've got to try it.
Please, Andre, for my sake.
Maybe it will work.
I beg you.
Oh, darling, I love you and I want you so much.
Please, please let this come out right.
Hurry, darling.
It will work.
It has worked, hasn't it?
You'll be all right now.
I know it's worked.
No! No! No!
A strange story, Mrs. Delambre.
It's almost impossible to believe, isn't it?
- What happened to his notes?
- He destroyed them.
- And the writing on the blackboard?
- I rubbed it out.
I see.
Well, I must be going.
Thank you for telling me.
Inspector, it wasn't wrong to destroy the thing?
A fly-headed human? No.
It wasn't Andre.
I couldn't have hurt Andre.
But I'm glad,
I'm glad the thing is dead.
I'll see you out, Inspector.
- Inspector...
- I'll be with you in a moment.
- Inspector...
- Do you believe the story?
Well, it explains all the facts, the reason for the press, the fly, everything.
True. But I asked you if you believed it.
Oh, I'm only a policeman, not a science fiction enthusiast.
But I do not believe what she said.
It... it can't happen.
But you don't...
Well, I... I mean, you didn't know Andre.
He was a genius in some ways.
Possibly. But matter cannot be transmitted. Oh, the story is impossible.
I'll be back at 10:00 with a warrant for her arrest on the charge of murder.
Nurse Andersone is under strict instructions not to leave her for any reason.
But, Inspector, it might be the truth.
It is the truth, to her.
I'm satisfied now.
She's quite insane. She won't hang.
- Well, I'm not satisfied.
- I wish I could help you, monsieur.
The lady's in need of a doctor's care, permanently.
There's no telling whom she might attack next. Perhaps the boy.
But there must be something we can do to prove...
There is.
Show me the fly.
- Good morning, Monsieur François.
- Good morning, Emma.
- How's the mistress, sir?
- Oh, as well as can be expected.
- Such a lovely lady.
- Yes.
Emma, when you had that mad search for a fly, did you see it?
- Oh, yes, I saw it.
- What did it look like?
Oh, just a fly.
I'd say it was a bluebottle.
You know, quite a large one.
- Did it... Did it look any different?
- Not to me it didn't.
She and Philippe were saying its head was white.
- But it was just a fly.
- Thank you.
May I fix you some breakfast, sir?
Nice cup of tea? Some coffee?
No, thank you.
Help! Help me!
Help me!
Help! Help me!
Please help me!
Help me!
We can manage quite easily.
Thank you, Mr. Delambre.
Well, I... I thought
I ought to be here.
Do you wish to check the warrant?
- As next of kin you have the right.
- No, I'm sure it must be all right.
- Madame? Time to get up now.
- Hmm?
Oh, I slept so well.
- Wonderfully. Is it a nice day?
- Yes.
- I think I'll have the silk one.
- Take this one.
- You must be warm.
- But I'm not going out.
Come in.
- Good morning, Mrs. Delambre.
- Inspector.
But I...
I don't understand.
I have a warrant for your arrest for murder.
And I must caution you.
Anything you say can be taken down and used in evidence.
But, Inspector,
I told you everything.
It is for the court to decide.
But you said it was not wrong to kill a thing.
- You have to come with us, madame.
- François, didn't you show them?
You didn't destroy it?
Inspector, you saw it.
I'm afraid I did not,
Mrs. Delambre.
I lied to you, Helene.
I never had it. I never had it.
You never had it?
If you'll just come with us, madame.
You never saw it?
Leave her alone.
She doesn't have to go with you.
I demand that I first have time to talk to my attorney.
Dr. Ejoute will care for her.
I've already consulted with him.
The patient is ready to leave.
- I don't believe it.
- I have his diagnosis,
- and his authority.
- No, no, wait.
Don't make things more difficult, monsieur.
- Here you go, ma'am. You'll be all right.
- No!
François, don't let them take me!
Don't let them lock me up!
François, please...
- Mommy! Mommy!
- Philippe.
Oh, François, do something.
Don't let him see me like this.
Please!
Philippe. You can't see her,
Philippe, not at the moment.
I'll take you for a walk.
I know. I'll take you to the movies.
But they don't open till this afternoon.
Then I'll take you this afternoon.
Is the ambulance for Mommy?
Yes.
Is she going to be all right?
Yes. All right.
- I ran all the way over here.
- Oh?
I wanted to see how she was.
- I wanted her to play with me.
- She'd like that, Philippe.
But she can't, not now.
- When's Daddy coming home then?
- Soon, Philippe.
- I saw that funny-looking fly again.
- Oh?
- Which show will we go to?
- Any...
You saw the fly? Where?
It's in a web.
A spider's going to get it.
By the bench in the garden.
- You're sure?
- Oh, yes.
Stay here a minute.
- It's in the garden. Come quickly.
- Please, Monsieur Delambre...
Philippe has seen it. It's there.
I beg of you. Please, please.
All right.
Show me where.
Here, Uncle François.
Wait in the house.
There's a good boy,
Philippe.
Help me! Please help me!
Help! Help me!
Please help me!
Please!
Go away! Go away!
No! No! No!
Charas.
Charas.
I didn't believe it, but you saw it.
- You saw it, didn't you?
- Yes, I... I saw it.
- I thought she was...
- As God is my witness, I saw the thing.
It's unbelievable.
I shall never forget that scream as long as I live.
You've committed murder, just as much as Helene did.
You killed a fly with a human head.
She killed a human with a fly head.
If she murdered, so did you.
I know. But who's going to believe us?
They'll think we're both mad.
But he could have started the press and got under it in time.
It could have been suicide.
Andre's mind was deranged.
Helene just tried to stop him.
But the stroke count?
I was the one who forgot to reset it after it was used the last time.
Yes. Yes.
It could have been suicide.
Oh, a great shot, Philippe.
- Oh, François. Thank you.
- Hello. You look wonderful.
- Hi, Uncle François.
- Hi, Philippe.
You taking me to the zoo like you promised?
- Yes, if your mother...
- Oh, you two run along.
We'll all have dinner together later.
Oh, good.
- Uncle.
- Yes?
Mommy told me about Daddy.
Something she said to ask you.
Why did he die?
Well, Philippe, he died because of his work.
He was like an...
Like an explorer in a wild country, where no one had even been before.
He was searching for the truth.
He almost found a great truth.
But for one instant, he was careless.
- That's what killed him?
- Search for the truth is the most important work in the whole world and the most dangerous.
I'd like that.
I'd like to be an explorer like him.
- Will you help me, Uncle François?
- Yes, Philippe.
- You better run and get a coat.
- Yes. Right away.
You're a dear one, François.
So kind and thoughtful.
Thank you.
Here I am.
Well, come along, you two.
I'll see you off.
Ave Maria, gratia plena,
Dominus tecum.
Benedicta tu in mulieribus,
et benedictus fructus ventris tui, lesu.
Sancta Maria, Mater Dei,
ora pro nobis peccatoribus,
nunc et in hora mortis nostrae.
Amen.
Well, what do you say?
I don't like it.
What is wrong with it?
There's nothing wrong with it.
I just don't like it.
Look here, my old friend.
Would...
You are my friend, aren't you?
Yes.
Well, would I suggest anything that might go wrong?
You would.
Look at the last time.
You were supposed to watch in the street.
How was I to know they kept dogs?
I've still got the scars.
I'll show you.
This ain't like that.
We don't have to break in anywhere.
It's all in the open.
Nothing can go wrong.
That's what you said the time before.
I got six months.
I've had enough of it.
All right, then.
All right.
We won't say no more about it.
Forget I ever mentioned it.
If you don't trust me, that's all right with me.
I'll just have to do it on me own, that's all.
All right, then.
I'm going home.
Of course, the doctor did say that I mustn't do anything that might strain my heart.
I'll see you tomorrow.
And, er...
I shall have the whole ten marks to meself.
- Ten?
- Ten.
- You said six!
- Ten, I meant.
Still, that don't worry you no more, does it,
'cause you ain't coming with me.
Ten. Ten marks... for a dead'un.
Yeah, well, like I say.
You gotta know where to find these things.
You gotta keep your eyes open.
Take this one, for a start.
He only got planted this morning, you know.
He'll be as fresh as a daisy.
Who is he?
Who?
Him!
Or is it her?
An 'er?
No, it can't be an 'er. It only came from the prison this morning.
Look, don't stand there talking.
Come on, we ain't got all night, you know.
'ere.
Come and have a look!
A baron!
Well... shall we get any more for him?
I ain't never seen a real-life baron before.
Come on, hurry up!
Blimey.
'ere.
It's a priest with no head!
What if he is a priest?
He's a dead'un, isn't he?
Still worth ten marks to me, isn't he?
Course, er... the head's a bit of a problem.
Good evening.
I am Baron Frankenstein.
Hear, hear.
- Hear, hear.
- Quite right.
I ask you, gentlemen, what do we really know about him?
- What do any of us know?
- Nothing at all.
He came here three years ago and set himself up in practice.
Before then, no-one had even heard of him.
Where did he study?
Where did he take his degree?
What's his background?
Do any of you know?
- No!
- No. No more do I.
Yet here he is, well-established.
The most popular doctor in Carlsbrück, by all accounts.
He hasn't applied for a place on the Medical Council.
I've even heard he says he can do without the Council.
Looks as though he's right there, doesn't it?
He's managed to steal half my best patients.
- And mine.
- And mine.
Exactly! And mine too.
Your wife amongst them,
I understand, sir?
Yes, well, I put a stop to that!
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
Well, the fact remains, gentlemen,
Dr Stein must be made to join this Council, or steps must be taken to see that he is no longer permitted
- to practise in this city.
- Hear, hear! Quite right!
Assuming he refuses to join, how do you intend to stop him practising medicine?
Mr President?
Erm... well, we have never attempted to prevent any doctor from practising in the city.
However, Dr Stein's refusal to join, er... to become one of us, is an affront.
- Quite so.
- Are there any suggestions?
- Oh, well, er...
- Send a delegation to see him.
Excellent. Delegation. Yes.
- Made up of, er...?
- Three.
Of course, three.
Yes, three.
Three doctors from the Council here.
- That is what I suggest.
- Seconded.
- All in favour?
- Yes.
- Fine. Fine.
- We ought to make an appointment.
- Hmm?
- He's right.
No-one gets into Dr Stein's surgery without an appointment.
Oh, he's most charming. So clever.
My dear Dr Stein,
Vera is in great distress!
Indeed, Countess Barscynska.
Please, would you...?
Well, I know that you insist that she's cured,
- but I see no improvement whatsoever.
- I understand.
She's weak and faint, the movement of every muscle is an effort.
Raise your head, Vera.
Higher, my child!
You see? No animation, no vitality.
You must revise your diagnosis.
Overhaul her!
Vera, my dear, go and prepare yourself. Yes, yes.
Now, let me see. What was your daughter's original complaint?
Really, Dr Stein!
It started with palpitations, then dizziness...
- Well, how could you forget?
- She's not my only patient, Countess.
Oh, those women outside.
I know most of them.
They're all in perfect condition.
Nothing wrong with them at all.
You should be my partner.
We could dispose of surgery in half the time.
That, of course, would mean half the money.
Oh, I know their fees subsidise your work at the poor hospital.
I know how good you are to the poor, Doctor.
But my daughter, Vera, she's all I have in the world.
Mm-hmm. Of course.
I'm afraid there's very little more
I can do for your daughter.
Doctors are not magicians. We cannot diagnose maladies which are not there.
You are a man, Doctor!
You can do a great deal for her.
Everything I have goes to Vera when she marries.
It was her father's last wish.
Now I'm having a musical evening soon.
I so much hope you'll be able to come.
Much as I like music,
I have very little free time.
Ah, poor man!
A life devoted to the needs of others.
No time for a life of your own.
There's always time for the important things.
- Doctor, I'm ready!
- So am I, Vera. You may come out.
Excuse me.
You see? Just a few steps and the poor child is exhausted.
Every movement is an effort.
- I'll go wait outside.
- No, please. It is better that you stay.
You always used your ear before.
I still use my ear.
This just magnifies the sound.
- Oh, Mama, it's so cold!
- Stand still, dear.
Now, breathe deeply.
I can't breathe. That thing's so cold.
Can you hear the palpitations with that?
Wouldn't it be better to use your ear?
There's, erm... three men to see you, Dr Stein.
They're from the Medical Council.
- They must wait until after surgery.
- Yeah, well, they seemed impatient.
When I've finished!
You're the doctor.
Have them wait in the ward.
- What? In the ward?
- In the ward!
And shut the door!
Oi, you! Tell Dr Stein
I want me rum ration!
Right, I'll tell him.
- Murdering butcher, that's what he is!
- Tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk.
He'd better not try and do nothing with me.
I'll strangle him with me bare hands, I will!
You're gonna frighten him.
How can I do me dance without me legs?
You'll have to learn to sing!
Ah, this way, gentlemen.
This way.
This is intolerable!
Gentlemen, you must remember that these are the poor.
The stench is enough to kill me.
Er... Dr Stein says for you to make yourselves comfortable in 'ere.
- Comfortable! You tell Dr Stein...
- Ooh!
Doctor...
There's Dr Stein, gentlemen.
Looking after the poor and needy.
Look at this. Interesting, isn't it?
Quite a work of art.
- What do you think, gentlemen?
- Er, why, it's, er...
- Very picturesque.
- We didn't come here to...
- You must have it off.
- Have what off?
This arm.
You'll have to strangle him with one arm, Harry!
He ain't gonna have my arm off, that's for sure.
If you'd rather die, it's up to you.
- Let him have it, Harry.
- The arm don't pain me none.
It's of no use to you.
- What do you mean, no use?
- Be quiet.
Five o'clock in the theatre.
Doctor, I won't be able to work no more.
- What is his work?
- Pickpocket.
Then you'll have to find another trade, or use the other hand.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
- Is he new?
- Admitted this morning.
- Oi, me pipe!
- What's your trouble?
It... it's me chest, guv'nor.
I'm not surprised.
You use it like a furnace.
It's amazing how dirty these people are, isn't it?
Keeps them warm, they tell me.
Well, hmm?
What can I do for you?
Well, er... I am the
President of the Medical Council.
Congratulations.
At our last meeting, it was agreed that you should become a member.
Really?
Have this new man washed, then I'll look at him.
- I'm greatly honoured, gentlemen.
- Then you accept?
- No.
- Huh?
Every doctor in the faculty regards your attitude as an insult.
When I arrived in Carlsbrück, without means or influence, and attempted to set up in practice,
I was met by a firm resistance from the Medical Council, which apparently exists purely to eliminate competition.
I have built up a highly successful practice, alone and unaided.
Having grown accustomed to working alone,
I find I prefer it.
- Do I make myself clear, gentlemen?
- Quite clear.
Thank you.
Good day.
- You haven't heard the last of this!
- A lot he cares!
What more can I do?
Well, he won't pick any more pockets with that arm.
And you'll have the parcel ready for my messenger when he calls?
Right, Doctor.
- Your supper's all ready in there.
- Good night to you, then.
- Good night, Doctor.
- And thank you.
A masterly dissection, Dr Stein.
You must forgive this intrusion.
Must I?
I wanted to renew our acquaintance.
After a few moments with you this afternoon,
I was sure I'd seen you before.
That's hardly surprising.
I've been practising here in Carlsbrück for the last three years.
Before that.
A little more than three years ago, at the village of Inkstadt,
I was attending the funeral of Professor Bernstein.
You've heard of him, no doubt?
Everyone has heard of
Professor Bernstein.
I was a last-year student at the university where he was lecturing when he... died.
- May I offer you some chicken, Dr...?
- Kleve. Hans Kleve. No, thank you.
Perhaps a little cheese?
I can recommend it.
The professor was buried in the family vault of Baron Frankenstein.
Shall I go on?
Please. Please do.
I'm the first, I suppose, to recognise you.
For what I am, or what you would have me be?
No, the resemblance is too striking.
That, and...
Your present activities lead to only one conclusion.
So, and what if I am this Baron Frankenstein?
Are you?
Just now, you were telling me.
Now you're asking.
Dr Kleve, why are you so interested in this gentleman?
I'm in search of knowledge.
Oh, knowledge? Ah, so that's it.
My name is Frankenstein, I'll admit.
But it's a large family, you know.
Remarkable since the Middle Ages for productivity.
There are offshoots everywhere.
Even in America, I'm told.
There's a town called
Frankenstein, in Germany.
Are you the Baron Frankenstein?
There are the Frankensteins emanating from the town of that name in Silesia.
Are you Baron Frankenstein?
Yes, Dr Kleve.
I was sure of it!
I told you that I'm in search of knowledge.
I want to learn more than any university could ever teach me.
I want to be the pupil of the greatest doctor, the finest medical brain in the world.
Your pupil, Baron Frankenstein.
Highly commendable.
And if I refuse?
You won't.
So, either I employ you in my researches, or...
Surely this is blackmail?
An ugly trait in a doctor.
I see it as an agreement of, shall we say... mutual reciprocation?
Your knowledge in return for my assistance.
And your silence?
- I'm not an easy man to work for.
- Few men are.
And when you've learned all you want to know, you might change your mind about keeping silent.
I wonder if I can trust you.
But then uncertainty is part of life's fascination, isn't it?
I'll take the risk if you will.
Will you accept me as your pupil?
Where did you study?
Under Professor Anderson in Edinburgh,
Dr Karl Strauss in Vienna, at the hospital in Paris...
Enough.
Unlike yours, my practice is negligible.
When do we start working together?
Now. Incidentally, Hans, you must exercise great caution when addressing me.
My name is Stein. Victor Stein.
Yes, of course.
The Austrian or Swiss branch of that family, Dr Stein?
Let's settle for Switzerland.
It's an exhilarating climate, if a little heady.
Please, do join me.
After supper, I'll show you round my laboratory.
- Evening, Doctor.
- Good evening.
The other one's down below, waiting for you.
Not the best setting for a laboratory, but it's ideal for my purpose.
Careful!
It would be a pity to lose you... so soon.
Surprised?
Originally, this was a wine cellar.
Karl, this is Dr Hans Kleve.
He is to work with us.
- Do we really need him?
- Oh, yes. I shall need an assistant.
Dr Kleve presented himself just at the right moment.
The doctor trusts me, Karl.
I hope you will, too.
Good.
Oh, this is Otto, our chimpanzee.
Karl, you collected the parcel?
Yes. Yes, Doctor.
It's over here.
Hans...
That's the arm of the pickpocket!
It is, indeed.
You need sensitive fingers to be a member of that profession.
It'll be very useful to me.
Now, come here.
Well, what is it?
- A brain.
- A brain?
If you put your hand too near a fire, what makes you snatch it away?
- The nerves.
- Exactly.
The nerves of the hand send a message to the brain, and the brain activates the muscles for withdrawing the hand.
But you don't put your hand too near the fire if you see it first.
The eye recognises fire as a harmful agent.
Let me demonstrate.
Now observe.
The brain, the hand, the eyes.
Watch the eyes.
Fascinating, isn't it?
So this is a brain.
All this paraphernalia, and capable of only one simple reaction.
Imagine for one moment the complexity of the human brain, the same size, perhaps, but a million times more efficient.
It controls every action, every reaction, stores memories, it motivates all life, and this is all I've been able to do.
But you should be proud.
I've never seen anything like it!
Haven't you?
No, I don't suppose you have.
You know that I... that Frankenstein, was condemned to death?
- Yes.
- Do you know what for?
But surely everyone knows?
The story's become a legend.
He created a man who became a monster.
It should have been perfect.
I made it to be perfect.
If the brain hadn't been damaged, my work would have been hailed as the greatest scientific achievement of all time.
Frankenstein would have been accepted as a genius of science.
Instead, he was sent to the guillotine.
I swore I would have my revenge.
They will never be rid of me.
This is something I am proud of.
Who is he?
Nobody.
He isn't born yet.
But this time he is perfect.
Except for a few scars, he is perfect.
And you made this body from other bodies?
Yes. My voluntary work at the poor hospital serves me very well.
All I need is the brain, and then I can give it life.
You've seen the result of this, and it's by no means my first attempt.
I only keep this cumbersome thing to remind me of the impossibility of the task, should I ever think of trying again.
No, the brain must be a living one.
Unlike the limbs, life cannot be restored once life has gone.
The brain is life, and so a living brain must be used.
But surely that would mean committing murder?
No, not necessarily.
I have a volunteer.
He's here, in the laboratory.
No, Hans, not you.
No, your brain is too valuable where it is.
His over there.
- You mean Karl?
- Yes.
We made a bargain.
If he saved me from the guillotine,
I would give him a new body.
Yes, but his paralysis. Surely that indicates an injury to the brain?
I examined him thoroughly.
The paralysis is due to a blood clot.
It can be dispersed during the operation.
Karl has a fine brain.
He's quick, intelligent, and he's absorbed a great deal of knowledge since working with me.
Haven't you, Karl?
Dr Stein is welcome to my brain.
As long as he rids me of... this.
You must have great faith in Dr Stein?
I have.
Are you sure it can be done?
The operation will be a complete success.
There's a... a young woman asking for you, Doctor.
She's a real lady.
She's got scent on.
Must have come to the wrong surgery.
Finish dressing that, will you?
- Right, Doctor.
- Where is she?
She's in the Doctor's room.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Er... Dr Stein's not here,
I understand?
No, no. He's at his surgery in town.
- Um... would you like to sit down?
- Yes, thank you.
- You don't mind if I get cleaned up?
- No, please do.
I'm Margaret Conrad.
I shall be working here.
Oh? The Doctor didn't tell me about that.
My father is the Minister.
Dr Stein has been informed.
I see.
I shall read to the sick.
Shop for them, you know.
Get them things like tobacco, writing paper, soap.
My dear lady!
They seldom wash, and they never write.
But I'm sure you'll be able to find plenty to do.
Thank you.
I won't disappoint you.
Or Dr Stein.
Oh, I...
Oh, Karl, this lady's going to work here.
Did you want something, Karl?
Er... I... I was to...
No, it can wait.
Oh, well, if it's a professional matter, I'll leave you.
Er... No, please.
I'll come back.
Oh!
When I offered him my hand, I didn't realise.
He seemed quite taken with you.
Is he a patient?
No, he helps Dr Stein.
Oh, there's a very sound brain in that unfortunate body.
Are you quite sure you want to work here?
I'm quite sure.
I did my best to dissuade her, but it would be inconvenient if I were forced to leave the hospital because of her father.
Well, she seems a very determined young lady.
You get her to wash one of the patients.
That should frighten her away.
You ready?
Where are we going?
The laboratory.
Tonight, we give Karl his new body.
You wanted to learn. Come on!
Karl, are you ready?
I'm ready, Doctor.
Good...
Thank you.
You keep looking at him.
Very soon, that will be you.
Ready.
This is to preserve the body.
- Embalming fluid?
- Yes.
Hans.
Keep it steady at 80.
Dr Stein!
Anaesthetic!
Quick, man!
Switch off!
All right.
How long before he regains consciousness?
An hour or so.
His brain'll take some time to adjust itself to his new body.
He must have complete rest, and avoid any sudden or violent movement.
As a precaution, I shall keep him strapped for a few days.
It was a superb operation, Doctor.
I learned a great deal from it.
Thank you for your assistance.
This is only the beginning of our work together.
- Must be Otto's feeding time.
- Yes.
So it is.
That was one of Karl's duties.
I'd better do it for him.
I wonder what he makes of all this.
He'd be very interested, if he knew.
In my early experiments with a live brain,
I used reptiles.
I removed the brain from a lizard and replaced it with a frog's.
The lizard attempted to jump, but of course it was physically incapable.
But it proved my theory.
The brain will continue its normal function, regardless of its environment.
Later, I used anthropoids.
I gave Otto the brain of an orangutan.
- Was it successful?
- You can see for yourself.
Now...
I want Karl close at hand, where we can watch him.
We must get him to the hospital.
I've prepared an attic room there.
Won't that be dangerous, so soon after the operation?
Not if we take care.
Get on!
Please, be calm.
Try to relax.
You're quite safe now.
He's bound to have a certain amount of pain as the anaesthetic wears off.
Now, Karl...
Karl, can you hear me?
You've made wonderful progress in the past week.
These are necessary for a little while. I'm sorry.
It won't be for long.
- Hans?
- Yes.
Good.
Now...
Just reflect the light on his right eye, will you?
Keep it steady.
Mm-hmm.
Now, the left.
Yes, excellent.
Now, Karl, try and move your left arm.
Left.
Now, the right.
There's very little wrong with you, Karl.
Congratulations.
I'm due in the ward now.
Dr Kleve will stay with you.
- You'll see to the straps?
- Yes, of course.
Except for the movement of his right arm, his reactions are excellent.
Even better than I expected.
Now, talk to him. Don't overtax him, but keep his mind fairly active.
When he shows signs of fatigue, give him one of those.
You can leave him to rest then.
I shall go to the laboratory as soon as I've finished in the ward.
Send for me at once if you need me.
- You have your key?
- Yes.
Karl?
You'll be up and wearing those clothes in no time!
Dr Kleve?
Yes, Karl?
When can I see my new body?
Very soon now.
I think you'll be proud.
Dr Kleve, what is... to happen to me, after?
Oh, there are great plans for you.
Doctors and scientists will come from all over the world to see you, and to talk to you.
You're a very important person now, Karl.
Dr Stein intends to hold student lectures.
They'll see you, a normal man with a normal body, side by side with your old body.
All my life I've been stared at.
It will be different now, Karl.
You'll be able to play a great part in the advancement of medical science.
Oh.
- Are you in pain?
- No.
I think you'd better rest now.
Not too much excitement just yet.
Here.
Drink this.
Hello, Ned.
Still suffering, eh?
- How are you today?
- Better, miss, thank you.
Oh, good. I am glad.
Well, now. Would you care for something today?
There's some soap, writing paper, or tobacco.
Oh, well, I'll have it all in tobacco, if I may, miss.
- No soap?
- I never use it.
- Miss Conrad?
- Yes, Doctor?
I must ask you to keep out of the ward when I'm on duty.
- Have you anything to do?
- Yes, sir.
- Do it, then.
- Yes, sir.
- He's a moody cove, ain't he?
- Mmm.
I beg your pardon?
Oh, I'm sorry, miss, but, er... if you knew what I knew... Cor.
Cruel, he is.
He cuts 'em up, you know.
Alive.
Don't talk such nonsense.
What? Here, let me tell you, miss, he had a new one in the other night.
Horrible state he was in.
All strapped down, he was.
Screaming his head off.
I don't believe a word you're saying.
You can see for yourself.
They keep him in a special room, an attic.
- All locked up, of course.
- Oh!
Well, then, perhaps
I'd better see him.
Just in case you're telling the truth.
- Would you like to show me the way?
- Well, of course I will.
I know where they keep the master key.
They don't know I know, but I know a lot of things that might surprise 'em, eh?
You wait 'ere. I'll go and fetch it.
Oh, er... I might as well take my tobacco now, eh?
In case I forget it.
Ta.
Don't forget to lock 'im up when you're finished.
And let me have the key back, eh?
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I waken you?
Miss Conrad, it's you.
How did you know my name?
I've met you once before.
You wouldn't remember.
Did Dr Stein send you to see me?
No. No, I just came to see if... if you were comfortable.
Thank you.
- All right, come in.
- Thank you, Doctor.
Oh, really, I...
I didn't intend to, er...
Oh. Well, if you insist.
Here you are.
Thank you, Doctor.
Ooh, that's better.
Just the stuff for a cold day, eh?
If you used that broom a bit more, you wouldn't feel the cold.
Oh.
How's the, um... how's the special patient, Doctor, eh?
- What do you know about him?
- Oh, nothing.
Nothing at all, except he's special.
What's so different about him?
Ain't he got fleas?
If you washed yourself, you wouldn't have fleas.
What, me, wash? Cor!
I'd catch pneumonia, like as not.
No, I'll have me fleas and keep me health and strength.
What is your work?
I...
I have no work.
Oh, you will soon get some.
You'll forget all about your illness.
I will help you when you're better.
You must come and see me.
I will write down my address for you, shall I?
I'll put it in your pocket.
These straps, they hurt.
Oh, they're far too tight.
I'll loosen them for you.
Now, then.
Take the animals in the jungle.
They don't wash none, and yet they keep 'ealthy.
You never hear of them getting sick.
'Cause why?
Because they are good and dirty.
And what do you know about the animals in the jungle?
Ah, you'd be surprised.
I'm a great animal fancier.
I know all about their habits.
Because you practise them yourself, eh?
And what's wrong with that?
They was here before we was, and they'll be here a long time after we've gone.
They know how to look after themselves.
Well, take the monkeys, for instance.
They got a good layer of dirt to keep 'em warm.
Plenty to eat, plenty to drink.
I bet they laugh at us sometimes, on the quiet, eh?
Now, if you get hungry, you have to cook yourself a meal of meat and potatoes.
Not them, no.
They get hungry, they reaches out for a banana.
They don't have to worry about cooking or nothing.
They don't even eat meat.
- They don't, do they?
- Meat? 'Course they don't.
Erm... do you mind if I help myself to another one, Doctor?
No? Thanks.
Did Otto eat flesh before you operated?
No, I discovered it soon after the operation. He ate his wife.
Ate another monkey?
What else would he be married to?
Do you mean he turned into a cannibal?
Yes. I didn't attempt to correct it.
He'd been through enough already, and he's perfectly happy and in good health.
But surely...
I mean, couldn't the same thing happen to Karl?
There's no danger of that, so long as his brain is given time to heal.
Otto became agitated after his operation.
He fractured one of the cells of the brain.
Does Karl know about what happened to Otto?
Of course he does.
It's just as well.
He knows what could happen to him, so he'll take no unnecessary risks.
Hans, I finished something today.
I'd like to show it to you.
What do you think of it?
I thought you'd be interested.
Before we go back to the hospital,
I want you to help me get him into the tank.
Who's down there?
Where are yer?
Hey!
You heathen beast!
There y'are!
Afraid I'm gonna bust your skull in, are yer?
That'll teach you.
Don't hit me, please.
I won't hit you.
Now I'll have to hit you some more, to make up for all the damage you just done.
Get up!
But how...?
But he was asleep when I left him.
I gave him a sedative.
How could he have undone the straps?
Why, Hans, not how. Why.
There's always a reason why.
What happened before you gave him the sedative?
Well, I don't remember.
Pull yourself together, man!
Tell me!
Well, I... I talked to him.
I told him your plans for his future.
You told him that?
You fool! You stupid fool!
Do you know nothing of human reactions?
Let me think.
Where would he go?
The laboratory.
Look!
He burnt his old body.
The janitor must have disturbed him.
Suppose his brain was damaged in the fight?
Sooner or later he'll need my help.
He knows that.
Go back to the hospital and carry on normal routine. I shall stay here.
- But shouldn't we search for him?
- Do as I tell you!
Ah! Thank you, Joseph.
I'm just going in to see the ponies.
Hello, my lovelies.
How about a piece of sugar, hmm?
Piece of sugar for Mama?
Good!
How about you, eh?
Come on, I've got a piece for you.
Come over here.
There.
- What are you doing here?
- I... I...
I had to get away.
You said you'd help me.
Does Dr Stein know you've left the hospital?
No! No, don't tell him, please!
Please don't tell him!
- You'd better come with me.
- No, no, no, let me stay here.
You need looking after.
I must tell Dr Stein.
No!
Well, Karl...
Karl, you cannot remain here.
Not like this.
You've... you've been kind to me.
Please, please, not Dr Stein!
If I promise not to tell him, will you stay here until I get back?
I won't be long.
Try to rest this as much as you can, will you?
Yes, Doctor.
Hans, I must speak to you.
It's urgent.
Come and see me again in a few days' time.
Yes, Doctor.
Look, I found Karl this morning.
He's at my aunt's home, in the stable.
At your...
- I must get Dr Stein!
- Oh, no, no.
Please, Karl's terrified of him.
I'm sorry. I must get him.
Please. The poor man's nearly out of his mind.
Anyway, I promised him
I wouldn't bring Dr Stein.
- Then I'd better come.
- I have a carriage.
Please!
He was in pain.
I thought I was helping him.
Of course you did.
Karl, I brought Dr Kleve.
But he was there!
I left one of the groomers with him.
Joseph. Where's that man
I told you to look after?
I don't know, miss.
I went to water the horses, and when I came back, he'd gone.
- Dr Stein must be told now.
- Shall I come with you?
No, no.
You stay in the house.
Oh, stop that, can't you?
Well, what are you getting annoyed about?
What do you think
I'm getting annoyed about?
We've been 'ere half an hour, and all you can find to do is look at a lot of ants.
Well, ants is interesting.
You can learn a lot from ants.
Well, you haven't learned much.
What do you mean?
They've got more sense than to sit around all night.
They get on with it.
On with what?
Oh, I'm going home!
Good night, Gerda.
Gerda! Gerda!
Is it much further?
We're in the park now.
The Countess' house is about three miles away on the other side.
Can't we go any faster?
I feel I'm to blame for this.
But I thought it'd be wiser to go myself.
When Miss Conrad told me she'd promised...
You should have come to me at once!
These interfering women!
Why have you stopped?
Oh, it's you, Dr Stein.
I'm sorry to trouble you, sir, but we have to check on everyone passing this way.
There's been a murder in the vicinity.
Can I be of assistance?
Oh, this is Dr Kleve.
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.
Well, sir, if you could examine the body, we should like to have a report.
- Certainly.
- Come this way, sir.
- When did this happen?
- About an hour ago, this boy says.
Did you see who attacked her?
All he could tell me was, when he heard the girl scream, he shouted, and then the man rushed off.
If it was a man.
What do you mean?
Well, sir, the boy said he had a strange shape.
Almost like an animal.
But, of course, he only caught a glimpse of him.
I think this is more than just an ordinary murder.
Have you searched the park?
Thoroughly, sir.
Well, there's nothing I can do here.
I'll let you have my report.
Thank you, sir.
Sorry to have detained you.
I have nothing against the English composers, Dr Molke.
It's just that they won't let themselves go.
- Not even Handel?
- Ah, but he was stolen from Germany.
- Dr Victor Stein, Dr Hans Kleve.
- Oh, Dr Stein, so you came after all.
Countess, I wish to speak to your niece.
It is very urgent.
Ah, but the night is young.
Vera, my dear!
- Excuse me.
- Certainly.
When you found Karl in the stable, was he the same as when you saw him in the hospital?
Yes, but he was very distressed.
- Is that the last you saw of him?
- Yes.
- Are you certain he hasn't returned here?
- Yes. I...
Oh!
Frankenstein!
Frankenstein.
Help me.
"Frankenstein, help me!"
Those were his very words.
- And then what happened?
- The poor fellow collapsed, dead.
Stein and young Kleve carried him from the room, and that's all I know.
I summoned this meeting right away.
You did correctly, Dr Molke.
What we have to decide now, gentlemen: is this man Frankenstein or not?
Mr President, while I was waiting for the senior members of this Council to gather,
I spent my time going through the old records relating to this Frankenstein.
The description of him given in them fits our friend,
Dr Stein, very closely.
Dr Stein, I beg you to listen to me!
Get away from here, across the border!
We can start again somewhere else.
There's no hurry.
But everyone heard Karl call you Frankenstein!
Molke was there.
He'll report to the Medical Council.
They're bound to take action.
You know the way they feel about you.
This is the chance they've been waiting for.
There was always the risk that I might be identified.
- My plans were made accordingly.
- But you can't stay here!
I shall be at the surgery in the morning at my usual time.
Have you seen your waiting room?
It's deserted.
- The whole town knows who you are.
- Do they?
And I've been summoned before the
Medical Council. What am I to say?
I'll come with you.
That would be madness.
Let me do what I can.
I've nothing to fear from them.
What can they prove?
On our way, Hans,
I have something to tell you.
Gentlemen, I deny it absolutely!
You deny your name is Frankenstein?
Have you ever consulted a street directory, sir?
Any street directory for any town in central Europe?
You will find dozens of Frankensteins.
I am a Frankenstein.
Of course I'd heard of
Baron Frankenstein, who created that monster some three years ago, but naturally I didn't wish to set up in practice here handicapped by such a name, so I changed it.
But the resemblance?
The uncanny resemblance?
This is a monstrous accusation, inspired by jealousy.
Baron Frankenstein?
Dr Stein!
Dr Stein.
How do you explain that wretched fellow calling you Frankenstein?
For the very same reasons as your own, I should imagine.
I think a little proof, Mr President, rather than a lot of gossip, would be advantageous to us all.
- One moment.
- Excuse me.
I am a busy man. Good day, gentlemen.
Dr Kleve, we have not yet questioned you.
All right, open the coffin.
- It's a priest's hat!
- Rosary.
We were right.
Frankenstein is not dead.
He asked for proof.
Now we have it.
You were just like the raw material for him!
- How's the head today, Kleiner?
- Don't lay your filthy hands on me.
Don't be a fool, man.
I've got to look at it.
You heard me.
Keep your murdering hands off me,
Frankenstein.
Yes, that's what I said.
Frankenstein!
Fugitive from the gallows.
Murderer. Mutilator.
Doctor, Doctor!
They're killing him in there.
Killing him.
Killing who?
Frankenstein.
On the bed.
- Hans...
- Don't talk.
It's no good.
You know what to do.
Yes, I know.
What kind of a place is this?
I have a warrant for the arrest of Victor Stein!
Come in, Inspector.
- Where is he?
- This way.
What happened?
It was his patients at the hospital.
They went mad and practically tore him to pieces.
I brought him here and operated in the hope of saving his life.
Well, the body must be taken and buried in unhallowed ground.
As it should have been three years ago!
Pray heaven I've got the skill to do this.
You were an excellent pupil, Hans.
This scar will hardly show.
Your next patient is waiting,
Dr Franck.
Thank you.
Lady Benborough and Wendy.
How nice to see you.
SUBTITLES BY POWERHOUSE FILMS LTD
This was the planet Mars
as my crew and I first saw it.
Dangerous,
treacherous...
Alive with something we came to know only as...
Death.
This is what we faced when our spaceship
cracked up in landing just six months ago...
In January of this year, 1973.
But it seems as if six centuries passed
before a rescue ship arrived...
For today, of all my crew,
I, col. Edward carruthers
of the United States space command,
am the only one alive.
Now, I will be going back to face my superiors on earth
in Washington.
And perhaps there, too,
I will find another kind of death.
Ladies and gentlemen of the press, as you know, the first attempt to send a spaceship to the planet Mars was made 6 months ago.
We knew that that ship, the challenge 141, had reached its destination.
But that's all we knew.
Teleradio communication with Mars ceased immediately.
And we were forced to assume that the ship and crew had been lost.
The man in charge of this expedition was a man who had become known to the world as the first man to be shot into space.
The man who pioneered interplanetary space travel.
Col. Edward carruthers.
2 months ago, we sent a second ship to Mars to learn the fate of col. Carruthers and his crew.
The president has asked me to pass on to you this significant news.
Col. Edward carruthers has been found alive on Mars.
But there is a tragic side to this history-making event.
Col. Carruthers was the sole survivor of this first expedition.
1 hour ago, we received a teleradio communication from col. Van heusen, commander of the second spaceship.
This ship is now ready to take off for its return trip to the earth from Mars.
And col. Carruthers is being brought back for a court-martial to face trial for the murders of the rest of the crew.
The rescue ship is ready to return to earth.
I am to spend the next
4 months with strangers,
a crew of men and women who have
but one single purpose...
To see that I face a military firing squad.
The emergency air lock in c compartment has been left open. What gives?
Sorry, sir, that was me.
I was dumping some empty crates overboard a while ago.
Name check.
Eric royce, secure.
Mary royce, secure.
Ann Anderson, secure.
Maj. John purdue,
secure.
Bob finelli, secure.
Lt. James calder, secure.
All right! Countdown.
Minus 10, 9,
Carruthers?
Carruthers?
What are you thinking about?
Those 9 bodies you left down there?
Yes.
But I didn't kill them.
Still sticking to your story about a mysterious creature.
Do you expect a court-martial to believe it?
It's all I can tell them.
I wish we could've stayed and searched for the bodies.
However, there's still enough evidence to put you in front of a firing squad.
You honestly believe I'd murder 9 of my closest friends in order to survive on Mars?
Isn't it logical, colonel?
The challenge 141 cracks up in landing.
You know you're marooned indefinitely on Mars until another ship is sent.
If another ship is sent.
You know the food and supplies aboard would last the entire crew only a year, but they'd last you 10 years, if the others were dead.
Those people were killed by something.
Not me.
I want to show you another something, carruthers.
After you.
At least I appreciate the freedom of a ship.
Why not? Can you think of a better prison?
Aren't you afraid I'll murder you all in your sleep?
Either It. Calder or myself will be with you every second of the trip.
Take a look at this.
We brought the dental records of the first crew from earth.
This is frank kenner.
Kenner?
We found it near the challenge 141, the day after we found you.
There's only one kind of a monster that uses bullets.
The second we hit earth,
I'm gonna jump through that air lock all the way to the ground.
Then I'm gonna roll around and stretch like a cat in the sun.
Oh, boy, the sun.
We'll be 50 million miles closer to it.
Even when I was a kid, I could never stand being cold.
How'd you ever win the ardmore fellowship in low temperature physics?
I wore long underwear. Ha ha ha.
Aah. That figures.
What do you look forward to?
Girls!
Oh, you!
I think I remember, a fascinating research.
Won't a geologist do?
You're, uh, military property, Ann.
Occupied territory.
Every time van sees you, he floats, even though the ship is equipped with artificial gravity.
These days, van seems more concerned over a manhunt, than a woman hunt.
It's just that Eric believes carruthers' story, I don't.
I don't believe it, necessarily.
Nor do I disbelieve it.
However, one thing's sure:
He does believe it.
He had to force himself to believe it or he'd go insane.
And I didn't do that, did I?
Missed your dinner, col. Carruthers.
I'm tired of ruining appetites.
I'd just like a coffee, if I may, miss Anderson.
Of course, colonel.
Better stay here, carruthers.
Jimmy?
Yeah.
Here's some last-minute computations on adjusting the orbit.
Look 'em over when you get a chance.
Yes, sir.
By the time we reach earth,
I'll have his confession on tape.
Col. Carruthers!
Thank you.
Such a cold, desolate world.
We saw so little of it.
Sometimes I almost want to believe you.
I killed them or I didn't.
It was me or something.
I've only heard the story through van.
Now you'd like to hear my version?
All right.
It's a long story, but I'll make it brief.
We were all outside the ship, exploring the Southern tip of syrtis major, suddenly a sandstorm came up and we started back.
I was driving the Jeep.
The sand was so thick we could barely see.
We were almost back to the ship when...
Cartwright just disappeared.
One minute he was there and the next minute he was gone.
As if something had just plucked him out of the Jeep like... Candy out of a box.
We heard a weird sort of sound.
Then we thought we saw a dark shape running near the Jeep and started shooting at it.
A few moments later, kenner and all the rest were gone.
I was the only one who made it back to the ship.
When the sandstorm quit, I...
Went out and searched all over.
There wasn't a sign of them.
How can you explain the bullet hole in the skull?
We were all shooting at this thing...
Maybe the one who got the bullet was lucky.
You don't believe me, do you?
I don't disbelieve you.
How about you, lieutenant?
Mars is almost as big as Texas, maybe it's got monsters.
Carruthers is still talking about his monsters?
Why don't you stop baiting him, van?
You're not using your authority very well.
I'm not doing it for kicks.
Believe me, chicken.
I'm just playing the odds.
Your odds, because you think he's guilty.
Admitted.
But, Anne, there's a time factor involved here.
He's unstable right now.
If I crack his story,
I can turn him over to the court-martial tied up in a little pink ribbon.
What if he's done nothing to confess?
Then he won't.
But I owe it to the lives of those 9 men who died to try and find out.
Don't you owe it to carruthers to treat him as a fellow officer, not as an animal?
Do you think he's innocent?
I don't know.
It's not for me to decide, or for you, van.
Ok, chicken. I'll let up on the third degree.
Looks like I either have to do that or get lynched myself.
It's you I'm worried about, van.
I hate to see you so vindictive.
Every move I make's worse.
Ah, come on, Eric, resign...
No!
Aah!
I haven't resigned a game in 30 years.
I'll be damned if
I'm gonna do it now.
What was that?
What?
I heard something.
What?
I don't know.
I didn't hear anything.
I learned to hear all over again on Mars.
Who's up there?
Kienholz.
Come, colonel, we got a game to finish.
Kienholz?
Did you hear anything?
Kienholz?
Now he's hearing things.
Come on, let's get him before he wakes up the others.
Kienholz?
Carruthers?
Hey, carruthers, come on down here.
Kienholz is gone.
Kienholz isn't gone, he's probably just turned in.
I'll check his cabin.
Kienholz?
Kienholz?
He's not in his cabin.
Kienholz?
Will you stop this nonsense, currathers?
Kienholz?
Kienholz, do you hear me?
Kienholz?
Kienholz?
Kienholz, answer!
What's he hollering about?
I don't know.
He can't find kienholz.
Kienholz, this is royce.
Reply at once.
Reply at once.
Joe, can you hear me?
Reply at once.
Report at once to the quarters level.
If this is one of his jokes,
I'll make him walk home.
Everybody search the ship.
He isn't here.
Come on.
Not a sign of him.
This is ridiculous.
It's just plain crazy.
Kienholz's gotta be here.
Where's your brother?
He's Comin'.
Hey, gino.
Hey, gino!
Funny, he was right behind me.
Hey, gino!
Gino?
Gino!
Gino?
Hey, gino!
Maybe he went below.
But we were here together.
Now there's 2 of them missing.
This is ridiculous.
There's just no place on this ship for a man to hide.
Ay, gino, where are you?
Gino?
Where can he be?
If he were here, he'd hear us.
Oh, look, maybe he's hurt.
We've got to find him.
Kienholz.
Lord have mercy on his soul.
C compartment.
First storage, c compartment.
Come quick. Come quick.
All hands on the double.
What's the matter?
What happened?
What happened?
Shush!
Hey, maybe gino's up there.
No. No, he's not there.
Over here.
If he's in there, we can get him through this hatch.
I'll go, I know the layout in there.
He's in here.
Gino!
Gino!
Gino. He found gino.
Easy, Bob.
He's alive!
Gino?
Gino?
Gino?
Gino!
Gino?
Help!
You're not gonna leave gino up there.
Get him out of here!
Get my brother outta there.
Get out of here, will ya?
Get a head start. Go!
What are you gonna do with those?
We can wire 'em up to the hatches.
Let's do it!
Put up the grille. Hurry up.
There wasn't anything else to do, Bob.
I know how you feel, but there wasn't anything else we could do.
We could've tried.
You heard what Jack said.
Gino was past help...
We should've tried.
Sooner or later, he's gotta come out of the duct.
Right into the grenades.
There, you'll be all right, but you have to rest.
Jack, nobody blames you.
Do you know what happened to kienholz?
Every bone in his body must be broken.
I'm not sure that's what killed him.
That shriveled-up effect...
I'll have to do an autopsy.
What is that thing down there?
Carruthers?
What is it?
Do you know what it is, carruthers?
No.
I have a theory based on what you and Jack told me.
You say it's man-shaped, humanoid.
Perhaps there was once a civilization on Mars.
It ended. Disease, war, something terrible.
The martians that were left went back to barbarism.
Savage murderers.
Maybe that's what we've got on board.
Bob?
I was only 3 feet away from him.
He was shaking his head, trying to warn me.
I was that close and
I couldn't help him.
Instead I ran.
Why don't you hate me, too?
At least carruthers did what he thought was right.
If anybody did a wrong thing, it was me.
But please believe me, we couldn't of saved him.
Gino knew that.
Gino knew that himself.
I don't blame carruthers, you,
I don't blame anybody.
It's just that he's down there.
How could that thing have gotten aboard?
And why? Just to kill us?
What is the usual reason an intelligent creature kills.
It's hungry?
What makes you so certain it's intelligent, colonel, not just an animal?
It opened the door to c compartment.
Eric?
Those gas grenades that gino made up.
He joked about them, said if we ran into any dinosaurs on Mars, the grenades would take care of them, but... If nothing else works, maybe gas?
They're in the chemical cabinet, Eric.
We'll use them as a last resort.
Jim, will you get out the gas masks?
The second storage hatch.
Close it! Close it!
Bullets, grenades, nothing stops it.
What do we do now?
What'd you find out?
There's not a molecule of oxygen or a drop of water left in kienholz's body.
Water?
Blood, bone marrow, glandular secretion, moisture in the tissues...
Every ounce of edible fluid in his body is gone.
Probably through some osmosis process, there are no punctures.
That's what killed him.
Cellular collapse and dehydration, not being crushed into that duct.
It holds together.
Mars is a world almost totally without water or oxygen.
The creature's entire being is probably organized to feed in that manner.
It preys on smaller creatures, which in turn feed off the sand itself, converting their intake and hoarding it as water.
I'm worried about van.
Infection's set in and I can't seem to control it.
It's exploring, testing.
It can get through the center hatches.
It has to kill us or starve, and we've got to kill it or die.
Why is it so quiet now?
Why doesn't it attack?
'Cause it's got gino, huh?
Bob, look, I've got an idea.
How is he?
It's an alien bacteria of some kind.
So far the infection isn't critical, but our drugs don't even touch it.
Col. Carruthers.
I know this may sound horrible, but you were right and we were all wrong.
It's taken this to prove it.
Anne?
Anne?
It's moving around.
Jimmy?
Anne?
Bob and I have a suggestion.
We could get around behind the creature by going out the control room emergency air lock, moving down the hull to the emergency air lock on the motor level.
That would put us one level below it.
We might be able to surprise it that way.
If we knew what to surprise it with.
I've been thinking of something.
At least, it's worth a chance.
Exactly 520 minutes,
10 seconds, now.
We'll time it to get to the motor level air lock at exactly 525.
Start making noise then, not a lot, just talk, move around.
Don't make it sound threatening.
Just enough to keep his attention away in case we make noise coming in below.
Good luck, in case we don't come back.
I said, "good luck, in case we don't come back."
The plan is a simple one.
While the rest try to hold the attention of the beast
with their talk and footsteps,
we will attempt to get to a level below the monster.
Our only hope is that this will be
the last attempt we have to make to kill the thing.
I've gotta fix that pillow for van.
I'm sure they will.
They'll be all right.
I hope they're making noise.
Do you think they're gonna be all right down there?
Grenades, gas and bullets
have failed to stop the beast,
but perhaps it can be electrocuted.
There's enough voltage in these lines
to kill 30 human beings.
The only drawback is, the thing isn't human.
I know, but they'll be back up.
They'll be all right.
Ah!
Hey!
I can't make it.
My leg's broken!
Get out! Get help!
I've switched the intercom to pickup his suit-radio.
Calder? Calder, can you hear me?
Loud and clear.
It's nice to have company.
Are you all right?
I'm alive, if that's what you mean.
I picked a good spot, right between the induction pumps.
You mean it can't get at you?
It could, if I didn't have this torch.
To reach me, it has to stretch down in.
Every time it does, I give it the torch in the eyes.
Can you reach the lock?
No. No chance.
Looks like I'm here for the duration.
Oops! Here it comes again.
Calder?
Still here.
The plate on this torch says,
"good for three hours continuous use."
And to return it for your money back if unsatisfied.
Hang on, Jim.
We'll leave the intercom on.
Just hang on.
Sure. What else?
Will you keep us informed of its movements... we'll try to figure how to get you out.
Just send care packages.
You know, if that thing should attack the induction pumps or...
The bank of control relays, we couldn't maneuver the ship or land it. we'd just...
Drift right past earth towards interstellar space. We'd...
Drift forever.
So I decided after one bad marriage to bury myself in science.
I didn't want anybody.
Van changed your mind?
If we get out of this, I'd...
Eric?
The bacteria is attacking the bone marrow, resulting in a leukemia condition.
I can fight it with drugs, but slowly.
Too slowly.
If they're going to live, they've got to have fresh blood constantly...
And there's no more up here in the dispensary.
Then we've got to go down and get it.
Sir, if...
You couldn't help calder.
You had to...
You had to leave him there.
Well...
What did you do, carruthers?
Throw him in as bait so you could get away?
Van.
How...
How come you...
How come you always get away without a scratch?
He doesn't know what he's saying.
I heard that.
Tell him he's nuts.
Van heusen's got it all wrong.
Hey, can anybody hear me?
Van heusen's got it all wrong.
We hear you, Jim. Thanks.
Somehow we've got to get that blood.
Well, this time it's my turn.
I'm going with you.
All right, we'll make a run for it.
One thing, remember there's only
10 feet of ladder between it and us when we get down there.
So, we better take it slow and easy.
One sound, and we're dead.
Let's take our boots off, huh.
Here are the inventory numbers.
Type o, compartment x-1, storage b.
They're all marked.
Calder?
I'm with it.
I'll let out a shout if the critter even looks at the ladder.
Right now, it's just prowlin' around.
Good luck.
Thanks.
Hey, this might be worth something.
It just went in the reactor room.
This might be the break we're waiting for.
It took gino with him.
Calder, listen,
I'm going to close the door to the reactor room.
Let me know what he does, will ya?
Roger.
Calder?
What's happening?
Nothing. Not a squawk.
We're Comin' down.
Eric?
Van'll appreciate it. Come back.
Maybe we can get calder out of there now.
Bob...
Take a look.
We'd better hurry and get that blood.
Easy, Bob, easy. No noise!
Okay, Jimmy.
No! Van, no!
No! Let me go!
Let me go!
Let go of me. Van...
I know what I'm doing.
Please, van.
We can unshield the reactor.
The radiation...
The radiation will kill it.
It's too dangerous while they're down there.
If the creature breaks loose he'll...
Wait until they come back.
It's a good idea, but, van, please.
Now is the time.
No, van, please.
Hurry! Van unshielded the reactor.
I hope that door holds if it wants out.
Bob, hurry up.
It's enough to kill 100 men.
Get up the stairs.
I'll be all right.
No, I'm not leaving ya.
Ah! Ah!
It's out!
It's out!
It won't die.
Eric, hurry. Hurry!
What about Bob?
There's nothing we can do!
Get that blood up there fast! Don't stop!
Eric.
Get up to the control level. Hurry!
Be careful, dear.
At least down below
I could've died on a mattress.
You'll be all right.
You'll be all right.
I guess it...
I guess it looks like it's you and ed now, huh, chicken?
What do you mean?
Uh...
I got good ears. I can hear.
You and him, just out of nowhere.
Let's talk about it later.
There isn't any later, the way things look.
That's why I asked now...
I, i...
I just got to know.
Van, please.
Anne, where are the flashlights?
Better get Goin'.
Mary?
Am I going to make it? I mean, if all of us get away, uh...
Okay, Mary, I understand.
I'm the guy with all the answers.
There is nothing to do but wait now,
nothing to do but see if the beast
will reach us through the center hatch.
We can go no higher.
We are in the top level of the ship.
This is where either we die, or it dies.
Calder?
Still alive.
Don't ask me why I bother.
Good. Can you see it?
Big as death.
It's been sitting here for the last half hour, licking its chops.
Incidently if anybody's interested at this late date
I got it figured how the critter got aboard.
How?
It Must've followed us back to the ship, after we picked you up, climbed one of the fins
just before takeoff and got in through
the open emergency hatch in c compartment.
Sounds right.
How's the air down there?
Pretty bad.
My suit-tank helps, but it's about empty.
Ed?
It's movin'.
It's going up the ladder.
I can hear it prowlin' around up there.
Anne, Mary, get those flashlights on quick.
Ed, it's going up to first storage,
banging on everything it passes.
It's Goin' nuts.
Can you get to the air lock?
Why? Look at the pretty stars through my broken faceplate.
Get in the air lock and hide there.
Eric.
Take a look at this.
The oxygen consumption's way up.
40 percent over every previous maximum.
40 percent! Perhaps the gas from the grenades.
No, that wouldn't affect it that much.
It's not a leak, the pressure's all right.
Are you thinking the same thing I'm thinking?
The creature?
It must have enormous lungs from the thin air on Mars.
Let all the air out of the ship.
If we can do it in time, we can kill it.
We can build up our air supply later.
Right!
Get your spacesuits on. Quick!
Aah!
Drive him below so I can get to the air lock.
Ed!
You have been called here again to receive further information about the story which was given to you last night.
I will read you the text of a teleradio message received from the challenge 142 less than an hour ago.
"This is Eric royce talking.
"Of the 19 men and women who have set foot upon the planet Mars,
6 will return.
"There is no longer a question of murder,
"but of an alien and elemental life force.
"A planet so cruel, so hostile, that man may find it necessary
"to bypass it in his endeavor
"to explore and understand the universe.
"Another name for Mars is death."
Subs by beastless 2012
This is a sacred pyramid, in the dead city of Tikal,
300 miles south of Mexico City.
Here, for thousands of years,
once lived the Maya,
a peaceful and cultured people
deeply versed in mathematics and astronomy.
But one day, in the year 607AD,
this people emigrated en masse,
toward the distant and savage north,
abandoning intact the solid houses, the pyramids
and temples they had constructed.
Not a single Maya came back,
the city remained deserted,
and slowly the jungle swallowed their streets and buildings
erasing all trace of that civilisation.
The scientific expeditions that had attempted to throw light upon the reasons for this migration
have never been able to give it an acceptable explanation.
It was once thought that they had been defeated by an enemy tribe,
but what power at that time could have been strong enough to defeat the Mayan people?
There exists no indication of any cataclysm of nature, and what catastrophe
could have pushed an entire people to build a new kingdom
abandoning the lands in which they had always lived?
The mystery still persists today
and the nomad indians who cross the area
recount how their ancestors fled this land in order to escape the wrath of a terrible goddess
a goddess who thirsted for blood:
Caltiki!
Look! Señor Nieto!
What's happened?
My God!
And Ulmer, what could have become of him?
Who knows?
So what happened? Were they attacked?
Only Nieto might be able to tell us but at the moment he's in a state of shock.
He won't be able to talk for many hours yet.
It's empty. He fired all his shots.
- But who could have attacked them?
- They went into the cave, near the volcano.
That's an absolutely deserted area.
What could have happened?
Perhaps it was Nieto, who clobbered Ulmer.
That's absurd. Ulmer and Nieto are like two brothers.
I can already see the headlines:
"Two archaeologists fight to the death in a cave in Tikal, Mexico."
Stop it, Bob!
We must go back to the cave, immediately.
Ulmer may be wounded and waiting for help.
Ulmer!
The mummy - aah it's Caltiki! Caltiki!
Caltiki is a Mayan divinity!
Let's go, John!
Yes, let's go.
I'll tell Ellen to look after him.
Come on! The truck will meet us at the cave.
Do you think they'll find him?
I don't know. I fear something horrible's happened.
That's how the indians feel about it too. They're all terrified.
Do you know what they say, that we should never have come here?
That we've provoked evil spirits.
I'm afraid it'll end up with them abandoning us if we don't go soon.
I'll tell John when he gets back, but I know how useless it is.
And Nieto - how is he?
He's still raving.
He keeps repeating the same name..
Caltiki.
Yes, Caltiki
Then he brings up Ulmer. It's really scary.
Do you hear him? It's better if we stick around.
We've already looked everywhere.
Where could he have ended up?
It's a script in Mayan characters.
The ground's given way here.
There's an opening.
It must have been opened during the eruption the other day.
Come here!
Look!
There are steps. They must have come this way.
Give me the Geiger counter!
They're remnants of an ancient construction.
Do you fear there might be radiation?
I don't think so, although it's best to check that.
Come on, hurry up with that gadget!
But that's the goddess Caltiki!
We must be in a subterranean Mayan temple. A great discovery.
Caltiki, but that's the name Nieto kept repeating in his delirium.
So it's certain that they've been here.
One moment.
Look at the dial.
It's indicating strong radioactivity.
Say it came from there, from something under the water..
This must be a sacred lake, where the priests, drowned the victims as sacrifices to the goddess.
But if only I had my underwater equipment..
Maybe Ulmer fell in there.
But this is his cine-camera!
-Let me see.
-There's no doubt.
It's really his.
He must have dropped it.
In fact, the shutter's bent.
We need to explore the bottom of the lake.
We must go back to camp and equip ourselves to get ready for a dive.
Before giving up the search, you have to try everything.
Let's go.
How is Nieto?
Well, worse. The fever's mounting, it's getting worrying.
We have to do everything to save him.
Bob has developed the film Ulmer took.
Maybe we'll understand what happened.
Oh, yes, we could. Get ready to project it right away.
OK.
- Can we begin?
- Yes, certainly.
Go ahead.
Who recorded this?
The indian who took them to the mouth of the cave.
Did you question him?
Yes, but he knows nothing.
He left them there and then came back.
Poor Ulmer! Who knows where he could have ended up?
Look at that! The eruption was still taking place.
There's the stair we discovered this morning.
Ulmer shot this part.
Look, that one down there is the goddess Caltiki.
What's he found?
It would seem like a bracelet.
- What's happening?
- Who knows?
Something's happened to Ulmer. They're in danger, they've been attacked!
Isn't there any more?
That's all.
These people are driving me crazy! I shouldn't ever have come here.
This trip was supposed to be a second honeymoon for us.
How could I foresee all this?
It was your idea to persuade me to come away.
But then, for you, work comes first of all!
But I can't stand it any longer.
I'm going back to Mexico City tomorrow, whatever.
Do whatever you want to. I won't force you to stay around, even if you're my wife!
Although I expected my wife to give me more understanding.
Since we're here you don't even remember I exist!
I have responsibilities, I'm obliged.
Without even considering that today we made a very important discovery.
An important discovery?
One man's dead and another one's dying!
That's exactly why we must continue. So that they won't have died for nothing.
What the devil are the natives doing this evening?
An ancient rite.
To placate the anger of evil spirits.
A sacred dance? Let's go and see.
No, I'm not interested.
- No, wait!
- But why? What is it?
A white can't participate in the ritual.
It would bring bad fortune.
Not to me! Ha ha!
Helen, I'm very sorry for what's happening to you.
What does that mean?
Oh, excuse me..
I heard everything John said to you.
I think that he behaved very badly.
I thought you were a friend of John's.
Yes of course.
But I want the best for you too, I'd like to see you happy.
A woman can't live this way.
You're.. a very sensitive creature.
You need warmth, and affection.
I believe that you've set too much store by our discussion.
It could be.
But I hope one day you'll take refuge between my arms.
Don't delude yourself, Max. Goodnight.
You haven't had much success.
Stop spying on me.
Is this how you set out to conquer that poor millionairess doll.
Poor Max, you're aiming too high.
And you do just the same.
I'm no longer able to free myself from you since I pulled you out of that third-rate joint!
You have no right to treat me like this!
You used to promise me..
Men promise any old thing to someone like you.
And then? I'm not sure I was the first.
It's true! I've never hidden my past from you.
But don't get rid of me so easily!
I don't want to lose you, Max.
Are you trying to tell me you're looking for a husband?
Hmph, take me off the list!
Find yourself a half-breed, someone like you.
Yes, dear?
Would you forgive me?
You forgive me.
Both of us have our nerves in shreds. Unfortunately.
But they say a good argument now and then guarantees a happy marriage.
Excuse me, treasure, it's all been my fault.
I'm capricious, it's true, you knew that before you married me.
And me,
I concern myself more with biology than with my wife.
But I'll change, you'll see.
Tomorrow we have to get back to research.
But I want you and Linda to return to Mexico City, first thing in the morning.
Do you really want that, John?
Yes dear, I'd prefer it.
- Pass the tank.
- Have you checked it?
Yes, all ready.
I don't like that lady!
But for luck, I've protected myself.
Be careful.
Up.
There's a treasure at the bottom of the lake, a fabulous treasure!
We're all rich, billionaires!
They're jewellery of the Pre-Columbian style.
They'd have adorned the victims offered to the goddess.
Who knows how many people are dead in there, all covered in gold and jewels?
And Ulmer?
Not a trace of him.
Maybe it's better if I go down again, have another look round.
No, it's pointless. I don't want to take any more risks.
But who thinks of risks when all this bounty is there on the bottom?
Bob is right.
Well, try to be quick.
I can't wait to get out of this cavern.
OK.
Let's go.
I don't want him to stay too long.
Let's get him up! Something's happened!
Come on, you pull too!
Pull!
Go easy.. slow now..
Come on!
Look! Look out Señor!
Save yourselves if you can!
Quick! Up the stairs!
John! We've left the bag with the jewels!
Wait for me.
No! Max, it's crazy!
Max, come back, don't be a fool!
Get up, Max.
We're safe. We made it.
Hey you, come over here quickly! Carry him away!
Don't touch his arm, it's dangerous.
If you'd waited just one hour longer there wouldn't have been anything we could do for him.
Luckily we were able to charter a plane to carry him.
This case has no precedent in the history of medicine.
This unknown substance has incorporated itself in the tissues of his arm and absorbed all vital fluids.
In your opinion, is there still hope of saving Max?
I hope so. But you, a qualified biologist, must also help us by determining what could be the nature of this monstrous thing.
What you tell me is seems fantastic.
But your hypothesis is correct, it's extraordinary!
You observe it too, Profesor Fielding!
I tell you again that this is not a known organism, but a fragment of an animal constituted of a single gigantic cell.
Quite so, but do you realise the audacity of your claim?
There would be a revolution in the field of biology, with the discovery of such a unicellular being.
What's strange is, why an organism of this type would need millennia to develop this way.
Can we establish it's age?
- Yes, certainly. Come with me.
- Thank you.
This apparatus is the fruit of 20 years of research.
It's an electric brain that, using an isotope, carbon-14, reveals the age of any body, also living.
In a few seconds we'll know in exactly which era the fragment came into being.
It's amazing!
You check the readings too, please.
No, it's not possible!
It's never gone as high as this with a living specimen!
But.. Professor!
15 megavolts - how incredible!
There can't be any mistake.
This fragment, this specimen.. this cell, must be 20 million years old!
Gentlemen, our expedition had one purpose: to throw some light on the reasons for the occurrence in the 7th century of the great migration of the Mayan people.
During the research, unfortunately in consequence of grave incidents, we have discovered the mysterious being that the newspapers are talking about.
And of which, we have recovered a fragment.
Maybe the journalists have exaggerated their deductions, but everything makes us think we are confronted with a living prehistoric being that goes back to the first geological eras.
But this, gentlemen, is not all.
I want to call your attention to a Mayan inscription photographed at Tikal.
It reads:
"Caltiki is one, and immortal."
"And when her mate appears in the sky, the power of Caltiki"
"will destroy the world."
This description coincides strangely with the characteristics of our mysterious specimen.
Caltiki is one, the being is a unicellular one.
Caltiki is immortal. This specimen is of an age inconceivable to us.
If I could renounce scientific rigour, I would tell you, 
I brought back with me a piece of the body of Caltiki.
Run to Papa.
Welcome back, dear.
Oh my treasure! Tell me, were you good today?
Yes. Mamma gave me a teddy bear.
Is that so? Aren't you going to show me?
Now, no.
He's sleeping now, because he got tired.
No, no, don't touch the bag.
- Go to Mamma.
- Come on, Jenny, time to go to sleep.
To bed with your teddy.
Listen, don't let Jenny into my laboratory.
- Why?
- Please, dear..
She's not to enter for any reason.
Go with your nanny.
- 'Bye, little Mamma.
- 'Bye, dear.
What's that there?
It's the piece of the monster that the professor managed to detach from Max's arm.
Why do you keep it? Wouldn't it be better to destroy it?
I have to keep it under observation.
We've analysed it but we still know too little about it.
What's made it live an incalculable number of years?
What guides it infallibly towards the organisms from which it sucks life.
If I could only manage to resolve those two questions, I might be able to say something new in biology.
How is Max now?
Very bad.
His life depends on the results of my study.
The only hope of saving him.
Unfortunately it's a tenuous hope.
Linda, you mustn't make yourself ill. There's never need to despair.
He's regained consciousness.
But he's so strange!
Sometimes he screams with pain.
Then he turns, looks at me, and laughs.
And his arm! My God, his arm! What a horrible thing!
But you now, you need to rest a little.
Yes, thank you.
Come to stay with us until Max gets better.
Hi, Max.
You've really had a close call!
How is Nieto?
Oh he's better. Much better.
He's back on his feet already, some day soon he'll come back to work.
What a lousy liar you are.
He's dead, right?
Yes.
But you're not going to die, Max.
You'll manage to pull through.
Have you seen my arm? My face?
Should I delude myself?
Max, you must have faith. You'll see, we'll do the impossible.
Oh, sure!
Sure, you'll use me as a guinea pig, and I'll die like the others!
What madness to go back into that cave!
You'll see, we'll pay dearly for this! All of us!
All of us!
Now you stay calm and drink this, it'll do you good.
No! I don't want to!
So, professor..
The outcome of the diagnosis..?
We're confronted with a serious lack of knowledge, Mr Fielding.
And the best actually available medical treatments are decidedly insufficient..
The diagnosis is difficult, unfortunately.
Why?
Because it seems a third-degree burn, but the tissues are like parchment.
But the skin..! The skin, one might say, has been..
- Mummified?
- Yes, exactly, mummified.
Exactly like that.
And the process has been very quick.
It seems an incredible story.
Yes, you're right, professor.
I wouldn't believe it myself if I hadn't seen it personally.
- Ah, but there's worse.
- What?
The poison will certainly enter the blood circulation, and unfortunately..
Unfortunately?
Unfortunately we must anticipate that before long it will reach the brain.
Miss Agatha, tell Professor Perez that the operating room is free.
"If we accept the hypothesis that, millions of years ago, a primordial cell"
"could have developed differently from all the others.."
"The amoebas had a similar structure to the being in the cave."
"Primitive monocellular beings developed by combining with others just like them."
"But this cell might have grown, becoming gigantic, without combining with any other."
"But what natural biological force could have caused"
"this abnormal development?"
Oh, it's you Ellen.
John dear, it's late.
What time is it?
It's almost one. Don't you think you should get some rest?
No, it's not the moment.
You see, I feel I'm on the right path, but the real substance of this being keeps eluding me.
What is it that's concerning you?
I must continue the analysis of the material of which it's formed, to discover the reason why it destroys every organism it comes in contact with.
I'll find a cure for Max's condition.
I can't abandon him.
Today the professor told me there's a risk he's going mad.
I've got to find out why.
It would be absurd to give up.
So, you intend to work all night?
Yes, dear.
Do you understand how I want the best for you?
All this is too important for me.
I must manage.
Good luck with your work, dear.
But perhaps..
Why not?
It could be this..
There's been a strong eruption, and you know that the whole area is naturally volcanic.
In the cave, we uncovered gamma radiation.
Maybe that's the source of energy for that being.
Radioactivity!
But we can't be sure till we scrutinise it under electronic bombardment.
Will you have the betatron put at my disposal, please?
I'll organise it with the institute. You'll have it this evening.
Thank you. I'm counting on you, professor. It's of the utmost urgency.
Are you ready?
If the conclusions we've drawn are correct, then surely, under the effect of the radioactivity, that little fragment ought to show signs of life.
All right, start it up.
The generator's started, professor.
Radioactivity zero six rad.
Zero seven rad.
Zero eight rad.
Stop it, right away.
Generator reports zero, professor.
On the cessation of radioactivity, it will enter an apparent lethargy.
But underneath it's intensely charged. I believe..
..it could develop more, and multiply itself.
Linda?
Yes, dear?
How considerate you are.
Everybody's so nice to me.
They're trying to help you.
Oh, I believe that!
Now they're afraid.
They realise what I'm worth, and they also realise that they've..
They've finished exploiting me, earning money from my work!
Because now it's different.
Now they must settle accounts with me.
Also that woman.
That woman that would be allowed to scorn me.
Don't think about her, it's me who's here with you.
She'll be sorry she treated me that way!
They'll all pay, you'll see!
I've been wounded, I've suffered, but now I'm strong..
I'm stronger than all of you!
You'd do better to side with me.
Remember that well!
Linda, how are you?
My God, you're exhausted!
Would you like a coffee?
No, thanks. Don't worry about me. It isn't worth it.
You shouldn't torment yourself like that, otherwise it'll end up with you ill too!
Today Max said very strange things to me. He made me frightened.
Well, in his condition it's easy to exaggerate.
It's up to you to give him courage.
It's useless, he won't listen to me.
He hates me.
He's ashamed of me because I'm.. a halfbreed.
Also, he's in love with you!
Why that's absurd.
I heard him that night at the camp. He was courting you.
And it doesn't surprise me, you've got everything I haven't.
You're a lady, you're rich. And you're also beautiful.
Max behaved with me like he does with everybody.
Excuse me if I'm blunt, but he's not the man for you.
He doesn't deserve you, you should leave him.
Leave him! How can I leave him in that state he's in?
One day he'll get well, and you'll be free. Free and happy.
Happy? My happiness is with him.
I know perfectly well what he's worth, but I love him.
I can face everything with him.
Everything! As long as I don't lose him.
Yes? That's me. No, my husband isn't here.
Then madam, you come. Come here immediately, to the hospital.
It's about Max Gunther.
Excuse me, but what's happened? A disgrace?
Ellen, what is it, Max? Has something happened?
Don't worry, we'll come immediately.
Was that the hospital?
Yes, they want us there right away, but they didn't explain the reason.
- Please, madam, stay calm.
- What's happened, doctor?
- Stay calm. Please don't do this!
- Where's Max?
Max - where is he? Where's Max?
I don't know. We've searched everywhere.
Be brave, Linda.
- Who is that woman?
- The wife of Gunther, I believe.
Send the alarm out to all the street patrols.
We're looking for a man, 33 years, of medium height, blond hair and blue eyes. He's wounded..?
In the right arm.
In the right arm. Dangerous.
Dolores, come into the house to help me.
What are you thinking?
The inscription said: "Caltiki is one, and immortal."
And these words contain a scientific truth.
But who's going to be her husband coming from the sky?
That which, according to the inscription, will give Caltiki infinite force, with which she'll destroy the world.
Don't you think we're giving too much credit to the scientific mind of the Maya?
Well, who knows?
It could be that they knew more than us.
- Are you still immersed in your research?
- Hi, dear.
Now we've abandoned that, we're reduced to solving puzzles.
We're looking for a bridegroom.
Is he so difficult to find?
Ah, it seems he comes from the sky.
Well, whatever you find, I hope you find it soon.
For a week, now, you've kidnapped my husband.
I'm truly mortified, but I can't do without his help.
Good night.
Good night.
So we'll see each other tomorrow, eh?
Till tomorrow.
Excuse me, dear.
Hello? Yes, it's me, Fielding.
Who is it, John?
What? Are you sure?
It invaded the laboratory and destroyed the betatron.
It's still growing! We don't know how to stop it.
Come immediately!
Set fire to it.
Set fire to the whole lab, if necessary, without losing a moment. I'll come immediately.
- I have to run.
- But John..
The husband coming from the sky.
What's that about, professor?
I don't know, but I want to have another try.
You wish to know if, in the year 607AD, a celestial phenomenon occurred?
-Right.
-Strange you should ask..
What interests me is that, it was the year of the Mayan emigration.
There was the passage of a comet.
It was seen at Byzantium, by an astronomer of the Emperor Justinian.
The ancients named it Arsinoé,
They defined it as a malign star, because it precipitated grave perturbations like those of a radioactive cloud.
But then, this would cause an increase in atmospheric radioactivity!
Naturally, we don't have precise data about it. But I'll be able to give you that tomorrow.
- Why tomorrow?
- Because tonight the earth is in exactly the same condition as in the year 607.
In a few hours that comet will pass very close to us.
Like, the same comet, tonight?
Certainly, that's why I found your request so curious.
Arsinoé comes near to us, cyclically, every 1352 years.
We're observing it at this moment.
Arsinoé.. "the husband from the sky".
That's the cause of the Mayan emigration.
Radioactivity increased the size and strength of the monster.
The zone around the cavern was infested with terrifying beings, that thirsted for blood.
It's the same danger that also threatens us now.
The radioactivity will make the fragments of the monster grow.
Operator!
Professor Fielding's line.
- He doesn't answer.
- Try, try again!
Miss, I absolutely need to talk!
3679 is completely cut off.
There's no time to lose. I must go to Fielding's house.
You, run to the betatron! We need to destroy the monster fragments immediately!
When we arrived, the betatron was in pieces and the watchman was dead.
A new victim, like Bob and the others.
Maybe he inadvertently started up the generator, causing the growth of the monster.
But we'll never know.
See that no-one touches him, for any reason.
It could be dangerous.
The amazing thing is how quickly the size of the fragment developed.
Another few minutes and I don't know what could have happened.
Inform the family.
When the husband appears in the sky, the power of Caltiki will destroy the world!
Mama! Little Mama!
Mama!
What is it, treasure, why aren't you asleep?
I saw a man. A bad man.
Jenny, there's no bad man here. You don't need to be afraid.
But I saw him!
You were dreaming, love. Now lie down and close your eyes.
Mama will stay with you until you're asleep.
All right? Sleep, treasure.
Have a lovely, lovely sleepy-bye.
I'm sorry, I didn't want to wake you Ellen.
I didn't manage to sleep, and I was hungry.
We're all nervous. The child just woke up too, crying that she'd seen a man.
It'll have been a nightmare.
Oh yes, no doubt. Good night.
Good night.
Max, I've brought you something to eat.
Did they see you?
No, you can feel safe. No-one knows that you're here.
Max, you have to listen to me.
Start again.
I love you. And you know that. But you can't stay here.
What, do you want to turn me in?
No, Max, I'd never betray you.
And John is your friend too.
John - he would be the first to denounce me.
You're wrong! You don't know how much he's done for you.
Now, maybe you don't understand that, but when you're normal again..
How am I not normal? Even you think I'm crazy!
Just remember, if you say one word, I'll kill you!
Ah here you are. Professor Rodriguez has gone to your house.
He did? Why?
We tried to telephone but you're phone's cut off.
- We got alarming news at the observatory.
- What's it about?
Right at this moment a comet's passing very close to the Earth.
It causes an increase in atmospheric radioactivity.
It's already reached zero eight rad.
My God!
That fragment at my house!
Get the police! The army! We need flamethrowers.
That monster can only be destroyed with fire!
Don't run away, it's useless.
No, Max. Don't do this. I thought you were my friend.
How beautiful you are.
Oh, how inappropriate!
You did a terrible thing leaving the hospital before you got better.
After all the trouble we've taken for you!
But why to you try to escape from me, Ellen? Do I disgust you?
No, calm down.
Listen, now I'll call Linda. You'll see - she'll be happy to see you again.
She's already seen me. And she helped me, and hid me.
But now I don't need her any more.
What do I care about her?
You're the only woman that I want, Ellen.
And you'll be mine!
Now you'll come away with me.
The telephone's not working. I pulled the line out.
Nobody can come to help you. You're in my power!
No! Let me go! Let me go!
Help! Linda! Linda!
Max, you promised me not to come here.
You walk away!
Give me that pistol right now. I won't let you hurt her!
Stay where you are!
No, Max, no!
Murderer!
Now you'll do whatever I want!
Obey me, or I'll kill your little girl too!
John Fielding!
I've heard you!
Come out!
Help!
Mama!
- Mama, what is it?
- Nothing!
Come on. Come on.
Halt! Stop!
Running a roadblock, resisting the public forces..
If it goes well you'll get three months, Señor.
Listen to me, inspector.
I'm Professor John Fielding, British citizen.
I beg you to let me go immediately. My wife and daughter are in danger.
I don't doubt that, with a husband like you!
Listen, inspector, there are monstrous beings in the house that nobody's seen before now.
It's impossible to explain now, but believe me they're dangerous.
And not only for my family, for the entire city!
Come on, take him away immediately, this crazy person!
Inspector you must listen to me!
Take him away. And if he acts up again, put him in a cell!
Let me go!
Call the British Embassy! Do something or you'll regret it!
For the love of God, open up I tell you!
Follow him!
Stop! Stop!
There! Over there!
Take him!
Take the Jeep!
- Where are you taking me, Mama?
- Be good, Jenny, be good!
- Mama, where's Papa?
- He's coming now.
Attention! Attention!
Commander of the Armed Forces speaking.
The city is in a state of emergency.
No one approach the south quarter.
Armed vehicles of the military, and flamethrower squads,
have received the order to move to the house of Professor Fielding.
Clear the roads for the passage of military vehicles.
No-one may leave their homes until further orders.
The population is invited to keep calm,
and all measures have been taken to deal with the danger
that faces the city.
Help, John, we're here!
Be brave, wait!
John, help us!
Everybody, go!
Stop shooting, it's useless! We need flame throwers!
And you?
Inspector, that Englishman was right, really! The garden is full of monsters!
I know. The alarm has already been raised.
The army will be here in a few minutes. Recall all our men.
Tell them to stay out of the garden, we have to wait for the flamethrowers. Go!
- Yes, sir!
- Let's go.
Everybody out!
Surround the house!
Get back men. We're letting go with the flamethrowers.
Quick!
Advance!
- Look! There's a way through!
- But where?
Let me go!
He's crazy! He'll be burned alive!
Cease firing!
Here I am Ellen!
Be quick!
It's breaking through the door!
Hurry!
Go on, give me the child.
Daddy!
Come quickly. Quickly!
Hold on to me tightly!
They're safe!
Start firing again.
Look, it's enormous!
Get back, everybody, get back!
The city's in danger! Get the tanks in to destroy everything!
Attention! Advance from the north. Break down the perimeter wall.
Group 2, advance across the garden.
Group 3 and group 4 ready for action.
Group 5, don't shoot! Use your flamethrowers.
Order the tanks to use flamethrowers!
To all tanks: open fire!
From the commander of the operation: the danger is over.
We're securing the area.
You can suspend the state of emergency.
The companies are returning to base.
Jenny's gone to sleep.
Please, take us away from here.
Yes, now we can go.
Now there's nothing to be afraid of, dear.
Caltiki is destroyed forever.
Subs by beastless 2012
Here passes from this Earth
Hélène Delambre,
...widow of my brother André,
...whom I loved deeply, hopelessly.
She was destroyed in the end by dreadful memories:
A recollection of horrors that did not dim as the years went on,
...but instead grew monstrously, and left her mind shocked and unsteady...
...so that death, when it came, was a blessed release.
Beg pardon, gentlemen.
May I speak to you?
No, you may not.
You're Philippe
Delambre, aren't you?
My condolences on the death of your mother.
Would you please get out of our way?
I beg your pardon sir,
I am an accredited freelance journalist.
You are an accredited, freelance scandalmonger!
Now will you please leave us alone?
Why don't you want me to speak to your nephew, Mr. Delambre?
Is it because there are a lot of unanswered questions...
...about the death of your brother?
All very mysterious.
First it was called murder.
Then it was called suicide.
First Hélène Delambre was held.
Then she was released. All very odd!
Granville, will you get out of here.
And I advise you to never try these tactics again.
Inspector Beauchamp! You were part of that big cover-up, weren't you?
This is going to make nice reading, I promise you.
Thank you, Inspector Beauchamp.
The newspapers can be unpleasantly persistent.
You must understand their eagerness to uncover a mystery, Mr. Delambre.
Yes. You and Inspector Charas were very kind.
- I only aided Charas. It was his case.
- No.
No, you were invaluable, too.
I shall never forget that.
You had a great deal to bear, monsieur.
If I can be of any help, please call on me.
Thank you.
That man's a disgrace to all decent journalists, intruding at such a time.
Nevertheless, he asked a question.
Why was Mother accused?
- I can't tell you.
- You've got to.
All my life I've heard whispers.
I know something terrible happened, something even more terrible than...
...suicide or murder.
What was it?
François...
Anything is better than not knowing.
If I tell you, Philippe,
...it will haunt you for the rest of your life.
Tell me. I have a right to know.
Take us to Delambre Freres, please.
The old foundry.
- Monsieur Delambre!
- Gaston.
Philippe! I beg of you, please, do not enter here.
This place is cursed and
I swear to you it is!
Ever since... ever since the day
André Delambre began to work in it.
It is I who... who found his poor, crushed body.
Believe me, I know... I know.
Please. Please, I beg of you.
Do not go in.
OK, Gaston. All right.
Thank you for warning us.
Now, we won't be long. Go about your work.
Poor old fellow.
It disturbs him when anyone comes here.
He remembers too much.
This laboratory has been locked since the day André died.
It's just as he left it.
The equipment... It's all smashed.
Yes, he did it - in a blind rage, to destroy the machine he created,
...because it destroyed him.
It destroyed him and your mother...
...because he ventured into areas of knowledge where man is not meant to go.
That's pure superstition!
There are no areas of knowledge where man is not meant to go.
Fifty years ago, stupid people said man was not meant to fly.
Father did research in the transmission of molecular structures. I know that.
- Just tell me what happened.
- Very well, Philippe. I will tell you.
Yes, it's true. André did do research in the transmission of matter.
The device you see lying shattered there was built to prove his theory:
That solid three-dimensional molecular structures...
...can be transmitted instantaneously through space,
...much in the same way as a television image is.
But a television image is merely an electronic representation...
...of light and shadow.
André's machine actually disintegrated the molecules of solid matter,
...and then reintegrated them again in a different place.
Eventually, André gained such confidence in his machine...
...that he put himself through the disintegration-integration process.
He successfully transmitted himself.
Then, on a tragic second attempt,
...something went wrong.
Unwittingly, he found himself in the disintegrator chamber,
...but he was not alone.
With him was a fly.
The result was a creature with the body of André Delambre,
...and the arm and the head...
...of a fly.
And so André decided to dispose of himself in such a way...
...as to keep such an abomination from the eyes of the world.
With your mother's help, he crushed his monstrous head and arm...
...in one of the presses out there in the old foundry.
Now you know why I didn't want to tell you,
...and now you know, Philippe,
...why we got to get out of here and lock this place up...
...and never come back again!
- François?
- Yes?
Do you remember what you told me after my father's death?
Yes, I think so.
You said he was like an explorer in a wild country...
...where no man had ever been before.
That he was searching for a great truth.
He almost found it, but for one instant he was careless.
- Yes, Philippe, I remember that.
- Do you remember what I asked you then?
Yes. You said you wanted to be an explorer like your father.
- And you asked me to help you.
- Will you help me?
Haven't I done so?
The finest scientific education...
No, I said I wanted to be an explorer like my father.
I've read his scientific papers.
I understand what he was trying to do.
I've done some work in the field myself.
I want to rebuild this.
It'll be his monument, his vindication.
Philippe... It destroyed him.
It could destroy you.
He was careless. I won't be.
- No, Philippe!
- You'd break your promise?
- It was the promise to a child.
- It was a promise to me.
- Philippe, I'm sorry, I can't help you.
- Why not? Give me one reason...
...besides your touching concern for my safety.
All right I'll give you one reason: Money.
I simply can't afford to back you in this venture.
Neither can the business.
That's the plain, unpleasant truth of the matter.
All right, François.
I don't believe you, but I won't argue the point.
- Then you'll give up the idea?
- Of course not.
- Philippe, look...
- I'll never give it up.
While Mother was alive, she was so obsessed...
...with fears that I couldn't work openly.
I did what I could.
I worked secretly.
Now, she's gone.
- Philippe, listen to me...
- Please! I want to be alone.
I want to stay here for a while.
Please leave me alone.
- Hello, Alan.
- Hello, Phil.
- I hope it wasn't too trying.
- Thank you.
- I had a talk with my uncle.
- Oh? Did he agree to help you?
No. But I learned some things today...
...that made me more determined than ever to go ahead.
- You still want to work with me?
- Of course I do.
I'll pay you the same salary my uncle does,
...as long as my money holds out.
We'll pick up right where my father left off.
The money isn't important.
It's the chance to follow up on André
Delambre's work that counts.
When do we start?
- Right away.
- Here in the plant?
No. I want to get out of Montreal.
I've got the perfect place to work.
- Would you like to see it?
- Of course!
This was my grandfather's house.
My father loved it so much, the old man left it to him.
So now it's mine.
Phil, it's a mansion.
- Monsieur Philippe, so good to see you.
- And you, madame.
This is Mr. Alan Hinds.
This is Madame Bonnard, my housekeeper.
Pleased, monsieur.
- Mama?
- Hello, Cécile.
Hello, Philippe.
- Cécile, this is my friend Alan Hinds.
- I'm pleased to meet you.
- How do you do?
- Alan's going to work with me here.
I'd like him to have the room next to mine.
Of course. And now you will stay for tea.
Oh, no. I...
Well, it sounds as though we're staying for tea.
While we're waiting let's have a look at the workshop.
You know, Phil, you weren't exaggerating about the girl.
She's a beauty.
Yes, she is. Come along.
Here's where I've been working.
It's fine.
Plenty of room to expand.
Well, this whole situation's ideal.
We can live here in comfort.
We'll have complete privacy.
The nearest neighbor's house is half a mile away.
Good.
- Now the first thing we have to do...
- After we've had tea.
...after we've had tea, is to go back into town...
...and get my father's papers out of the old lab.
I wouldn't want François to know.
There's a watchman there, an old fellow named Gaston.
We may have to lure him away.
Well, he doesn't know me. I'll cook up some kind of a story for him.
All right.
We'll take what we need.
Diagrams, notes of experiments, anything we can find.
Then we'll get to work.
You won't know the old wine cellar when we get through with it.
We'll have it filled with equipment.
We'll let you visit if you bring us biscuits like this to eat.
- I will. I baked them myself.
- I don't believe it.
- Truly I did!
- Really?
You've known each other a long time, haven't you?
Since we were children.
I used to come here to visit my grandfather.
We played together in the garden.
Once Philippe got very angry at me and threw sand in my face!
Threw sand in this lovely creature's face? You cad!
- Philippe!
- What on earth's the matter?
Are you ill, Monsieur Philippe?
You look as if you've just seen a ghost, old man.
It was the fly. The fly disturbed you.
I've always hated them.
I... I'm sorry.
- Now what do we do?
- I don't know.
A water-cooled tetrode would do the job, but it'd cost a fortune.
- Bank account getting anaemic?
- Yes, it is.
Look, Phil, I've been meaning to speak about this.
You've been paying me for three weeks now,
...and I haven't spent a dime.
There's been no need to.
The food and lodging here are wonderful.
So forget about the salary.
Pay me when your gadget's a whopping success, which I'm sure it will be.
Thanks, Alan.
Believe me, I appreciate it.
- Good day, Madame Bonnard.
- Bonjour, Monsieur François.
- Where is Philippe?
- In the cellar, working.
Thank you.
Hello, François.
I wondered how soon you'd find me.
Well, it didn't take a genius to do that.
Well, I see you've gone ahead, against my wishes.
Well, this is my house.
I've used my own money.
- So you knew Alan Hinds was with me?
- Yes, of course.
I suspected that when he left my employ.
Thanks for your loyalty.
Well, as you said, this is your house.
Now I suppose you'll ask me to leave.
No, François, I wouldn't do that.
As a matter of fact
I'm glad you came here.
You've saved me a trip into town.
The truth is, I've about run out of money.
- I said I wouldn't back you.
- Yes, you did say that.
But I am half-owner of Delambre Frères?
Yes, you are.
All right, I want my half.
Nonsense. You can't divide a business like a sack of apples.
I'll sell my half-interest for whatever it will bring,
...to anyone who will buy it.
You can't be serious.
Would you destroy a company that's been in our family for over 100 years?
If I had to.
- You're holding a gun to my head.
- I'm sorry, François.
But if you won't help me,
I'll raise the money any way I can.
Yes, I think you would.
I think you would.
Very well.
Because I have a sense of responsibility to Delambre Freres, even if you do not,
...I'll undertake to supply you with whatever you need.
Thanks, François.
It's going to work. Believe me,
I don't want just your money.
- I want you to work with us.
- I'll work with you.
Not because I'm won over,
...or have any hope that you will succeed where André failed,
...but to protect you, if I can,
...from the deadly consequences of building this device.
And I'll keep on trying to dissuade you every step of the way...
...from continuing with this project.
That's fine. You're welcome to try.
But just work with me.
I promise you'll come to believe in this thing as firmly as I do.
- We'll see.
- We will see.
- When can I order new equipment?
- Whenever you like.
- Today?
- If you like.
I'll meet you at the plant.
Very well.
Phil, you were wonderful.
Now we can really get started.
I'm sorry I had to do it that way.
I'll tag along with you if you don't mind.
- I've got some errands in town.
- All right.
- I'll pick you up here about three.
- Three it is.
Taxi!
- Hello, Ronnie.
- Not Ronnie. Alan Hinds, if you please.
Well, Mr. Hinds, what brings you here?
- Money.
- Did you say money?
- You'll get none from me, my boy.
- Just a moment, my fine fat friend.
What would you say if
I told you I'm on the track...
...of something worth millions?
- I'd say you were lying.
- Not this time, Max.
Look, one thing you'll admit:
I know about electronics.
I've been working for Delambre Freres.
The new radar for the
Canadian Air Force. Might be valuable.
Max, this is no radar.
It's something really fantastic,
...and I'm in a great spot to steal it.
Go ahead and steal it.
Why come to me?
I need someone to sell it for me.
I'll nab the drawings and specifications. You sell them.
Ronnie, you'd double-cross your own mother.
So would you.
But there's plenty for both of us.
- I tell you, it's tremendous.
- Very well, it's tremendous.
What is it?
Were you here in Montreal when André Delambre was killed?
- I was.
- Do you recall some strange rumours...
...about the project he was working on at the time of his death?
Yes, I do.
You get in touch with the leading...
...electronics outfits, the big international cartels.
Ask them just one thing:
If they're interested in a disintegrator-integrator.
Then sit back and wait for the offers to come in.
They'll want something to go on, some sort of proof.
I'll bring you something in a day or so.
Just enough to whet their appetites.
Anything we get we split 50-50. A deal?
I'll work with you.
Not that I trust you.
Naturally not - you'd be a fool to.
And you're no fool.
A greedy pig perhaps, but no fool.
Thank you. By the way, where can I reach you if I need you?
Max! Please give me credit for a little sense too.
You'll hear from me when I'm ready.
- You can depend on me.
- I'm sure of that.
With the British police looking for you, you wouldn't dare play games with me.
How many years would they give you if they took you back to London?
Nothing like that.
Hanging, perhaps, but no prison.
You see, I once terminated a partnership with a chap who proved unreliable.
As a matter of fact, I terminated him.
- Goodbye, Max.
- Goodbye, Ronnie.
Alan! What are you doing in this part of town?
An old friend -
I... I visit him whenever I'm in town.
OK, Alan. It all checks out.
Well, sir, now that we're ready to give it a go,
...would you like to make a little wager?
Not as sceptical as you were?
I knew we'd make a believer of you.
Since an ashtray was the first object transmitted in Father's experiments,
...I consider it only fitting that we use one in ours.
- Perfect.
- No transposition.
None.
- Morning, Philippe.
- Morning, François.
- Morning, Alan.
- Morning.
- Well what's on our schedule for today?
- We're going to try a live subject.
- A guinea pig?
- Finished here, Phil.
Would you check the fire circuit, François?
Right.
- Giantism!
- Must be in the amplitude control.
Well, let's find it. Let's check everything.
Hello, Cécile.
- It's late.
- Yes, I know.
Thank you, Cécile.
Phil?
Well, he looks perfectly normal.
Put a guinea pig in the disintegrator cabinet, will you, Alan?
Now that we have the giantism's corrected,
...we'll attempt the experiment
Father describes here.
First the disintegration half of the cycle:
"Hold the subject in a disembodied state for a time,"
"...then complete the cycle and bring the subject back."
Disintegration cycle only.
In none of his experiments did he record any ill effects...
...from delayed reintegration.
Well, we'll bring him back tomorrow morning about ten.
All right. I'll make it a point to be back here then.
Come on, Phil. Call it a day.
You can't work day and night, you know.
I'm not tired.
- Too excited, I guess.
- I can understand that.
Got him.
Phil! I'm sorry, old man, really I am.
Here.
What is it? Why do those nasty little brutes bother you?
I'm your friend. You can tell me.
If you are my friend, don't ever do that again.
Certainly not. I won't.
Come on. You've had a big day.
You've got to take care of yourself.
Go on upstairs and get some rest.
Tomorrow will be a big day, too.
I suppose you're right.
Ronald Holmes, you're under arrest.
None of that now! Stand up.
- How did you find me?
- Never mind about that.
Where are all your coppers?
You... you didn't come here alone?
Turn around and put out your hands.
- Philippe, what was it? The lights!
- They dimmed in my room, too.
Alan?
What happened? Every light in the house dimmed.
Short circuit. Stupid of me.
I got the back of this chair tangled with the main power switch.
Hope I didn't ruin anything.
Some chunks of copper melted out.
That's about all.
I don't see how it could affect the machine.
I'm sure it couldn't.
Maybe we should try it,
...bring the rat back a little ahead of schedule.
Wait a minute, Phil.
François said he'd make it a point to be here, didn't he?
I'm sure he'd be offended if we just went ahead without him.
The machine's all right.
The circuit breakers didn't even kick out.
You're probably right.
We'll wait.
I was just going to bed when the lights began to dim.
I just came down to have another look at the ballast circuit.
I'll put the stuff away, then I'll turn in too.
- All right. Good night, Alan.
- Good night.
- Hello?
- Max, I want you to meet me tonight.
- I can't. I've got some work to do.
- It's got to be tonight.
No, I can't come there.
I'll tell you when I see you.
Max, you meet me in 40 minutes...
...out on the old Cross Creek road, a mile west of the highway.
You be there!
- Couldn't this wait until the morning?
- No. I have to get rid of this car now.
Ronnie, what are you up to?
Over she goes, right there.
Well, Max, any interest in our proposition?
Interest? Yes, indeed.
I got in touch with the four biggest concerns.
Two of them are ready to do business.
All they ask is an indication that we've really got it.
Well, here's your indication.
Just enough to show we're on the right track,
...not enough to give away the whole idea.
Right you are.
I'll process this film when I get back.
I'll walk the rest of the way.
You get busy with your contacts,
...show them that film, and line up the best deal you can get.
I'll finish up my end here and get in touch with you tomorrow.
All right, Ronnie.
- Hello, Alan.
- Philippe, you... you startled me.
- What were you doing out there?
- Well I heard a car starting,
...so I went out to investigate.
Madame Bonnard heard a car.
She woke me up and told me about it.
But that was nearly two hours ago.
Oh, no. This was only
10 or 15 minutes ago.
A different car, perhaps.
Mysterious goings-on, eh?
Very mysterious.
Bloodstains there...
It looks as though someone tried to wipe them up.
They are bloodstains, aren't they?
Well, Phil, I'm heartily ashamed, believe me.
You did try to reintegrate the rat, didn't you?
And got nothing.
It's inexcusable, I know, but I was so curious...
...to see whether we had that giantism problem licked,
...that I brought him back to have a look at him.
Go on. You're doing fine.
Well, the little beggar bit me,
...I lost my temper, and I killed him.
- I'm sorry.
- Let's see the wound.
- What?
- Let's see the wound.
Rat bites are dangerous.
They should be cared for.
It's nothing, really.
It's just a scratch.
Not worth bothering about.
You have an explanation for everything, don't you, Alan?
Look, Phil, old man, I...
Let's hear you explain these.
Oh, I can explain those.
But I'm not going to.
With this, a chap doesn't have to do any explaining, does he?
Give me your keys.
Your keys!
Open the cabinet!
I trusted you, Alan.
I'd have given you a fair share of anything I made on the machine.
Open it!
It's too late, Alan.
I've already called the police.
Monsieur François!
A quarrel?
Where is Philippe?
Cécile. Cécile,
I had a telephone call from Philippe.
Some trouble about Alan. Where is he?
- They fought, monsieur.
- Fought? Who fought?
Alan? Philippe? Where? Where?
Down there. Philippe cried out.
And then I heard the machine!
The machine?!
Alan? Alan?
Alan, where?
Where's Philippe?
That's an interesting question, Mr. Delambre.
Where is he?
Shall we say, he's sewing the cause of science?
Alan!
- Monsieur François!
- Help me get inside.
This is a terrible wound, monsieur.
Please let me call a doctor.
No, I've got to get down to the laboratory.
It's the only way to save Philippe.
Help...
The police.
I don't want the police here...
...until I've finished with the machine.
Madame Bonnard, delay them if you can.
Halt!
Police Department.
- Police Department.
- This is Sergeant Dubois.
We have an injured man, gunshot wound.
Send an ambulance to 418 Cromwell Road.
Help me! Cécile!
Help me!
I'm here! On the door! Cécile!!
Help me!
Cécile!
Monsieur? What is it?
- Good morning, Lieutenant.
- Where's Delambre?
Just back from surgery.
They got the bullet out.
I want to talk to him.
I'm told it'll take several hours, and then some.
This whole thing is beginning to tie together.
The handcuffs were Evans' all right,
...and it's my belief that he's been killed.
There were bloodstains on the ground outside...
...and marks where someone had been dragged to a car.
I want to talk to François Delambre as soon as he's conscious.
Yes sir.
Thank you.
Get Lieutenant MacLish, please.
Monsieur Delambre,
I am Sergeant Dubois, Police Department.
Did you... Did you catch him?
Your nephew? No, we did not.
But you saw him.
You know. You saw the creature.
The creature, sir? My men and I saw someone in the laboratory.
He disobeyed an order to halt,
...so I fired, but he escaped.
Then you didn't see him?
We didn't see his face, if that's what you mean.
It was your nephew, wasn't it?
I must talk to Inspector Beauchamp.
I'm sorry, but Inspector Beauchamp is out of town on official business.
- Lieutenant MacLish is in charge.
- I...
I must talk to Inspector Beauchamp.
Monsieur Delambre, this is Lieutenant MacLish.
I won't speak to anyone but Inspector Beauchamp.
Mr. Delambre, I'm in charge here.
You will kindly answer my questions.
Why did your nephew run away?
I demand the right to speak to Inspector Beauchamp!
Mr. Delambre, your continued refusal may cost your nephew his life!
He has repeatedly disobeyed orders to halt.
Now my men have orders to shoot on sight.
No... That would be murder.
- He's done nothing.
- Then why did he run from us?
I want to see Inspector Beauchamp.
- Stay with him.
- Yes, sir.
Monsieur Delambre... Tell me, please, why must you talk to
Inspector Beauchamp?
Why?
He aided Inspector Charas in the investigation of...
...my brother's death.
He knows the... the terrible secret.
You wouldn't believe...
You would not believe...
This terrible secret...
Does it concern a fly?
What... What did you see?
- What did you see?!
- Nothing.
I... I thought I... It is nothing.
I'll get in touch with Inspector Beauchamp at once.
Hello? Ronnie? Where are you?
I've been getting the material organized. You all set on your end?
Yes, yes, all set. They've got the money ready.
I must say, you've botched things thoroughly.
There's no doubt of it.
Young Delambre is looking for you.
Exactly. He's looking for me.
You have nothing to worry about.
Perhaps not. But I suggest you hurry.
Thank you.
Inspector Beauchamp...
Thank God you're here.
Inspector, it's... it's happened again. To Philippe.
Yes, when I heard about the laboratory and that strange machine, I knew...
The machine... The machine must not be tampered with.
If it's disturbed,
Philippe will be lost forever.
It won't be touched, I assure you.
If...
- If Philippe is taken alive...
- Yes?
If Philippe is taken alive,
...we still have to find the tiny creature, you remember?
Yes, I remember.
We'll find it. I'll go to the laboratory myself.
The integrator cabinet was smashed.
I've... I've instructed them to make a new one.
Yes, but will you have the strength to operate...
...the machine when the time comes?
- I'll find the strength.
- I'm sure you will.
Take him upstairs, please.
Mademoiselle, I'm Inspector Beauchamp.
Would you mind taking me to Mr. Philippe's workshop, please?
I will show you.
Cécile! I'm Philippe!
Philippe!
No one will help me!
Cécile! Cécile!
Cécile! I'm Philippe!
Philippe! No one will help me!
Cécile! Cécile!!
Cécile!
I'm Philippe! Philippe!
Help me! Cécile!
Cécile! Cécile!
- Nurse, would you excuse us, please?
- Yes, Inspector.
- Did you catch it?
- Yes, I caught it.
It seemed feeble. I gave it food.
How long does a fly live?
Musca domestica, common housefly:
Life span about three weeks.
But they die very quickly when it's cold.
I'll see that the laboratory is kept warm.
But how can we know how much of its life span this creature has left?
It seems so hopeless,
Inspector. So hopeless.
My dear friend, nothing is ever hopeless.
But with 100 men searching for him,
...hunting him down as though he were a wild animal...
How can he elude 100 men?
Perhaps he's dead already.
Wounded by one of your police bullets,
...he may have crawled into some lonely thicket to die.
Keep up your courage.
You're going to need it, all of it, when we find him.
What is it?
- The man you knew as Alan Hinds.
- Yes?
He's dead. Neck bones crushed by some gigantic pressure.
Also, a notorious dealer in stolen property named Max Barthold.
Did Philippe do it?
- What can we do?
- Wait until the police catch Philippe.
Or, if he evades them, wait until he comes here.
You and the girl and her mother...
...are the only ones he can possibly turn to for help.
- Inspector...
- Yes?
Suppose he does come here.
And suppose he's not like André.
When this same ghastly thing happened to my brother,
...he still had a human mind and a human conscience.
What if Philippe does not have the mind...
...of a human, but the murderous brain of the fly?
I pray that he does not.
But if he does come here, not for help, but...
...to kill?
Then he will have to be destroyed.
Inspector! Please, help me!
Tell François he's needed in the laboratory.
He'll understand and do not let the nurse interfere.
I'm all right.
Put him in the cabinet, quickly.
This is the worst storm yet.
Yeah, almost every night for the last three months.
Well, it sure ain't natural.
I'm getting away from this lightning while I still can.
Ah, you'll be soaked to the bone before you get ten yards.
Well I'd better be soaked than barbecued.
What if we ran for it?
It's impossible to make it to the main road.
Maybe we can make it to the old willows place?
Are you out of your mind?
Do you actually believe in them monsters?
But the newspaper story said...
Oh, act your age, Mac.
Here's the house.
Don't look good to me.
Ah, you're just spooked.
Well, spooked or not, that place just don't look healthy.
It hasn't been lived in in 15 years, it's deserted.
It is, huh?
Thought you said this place was deserted?
Well, it's supposed to be. I don't get it. what do you want?
Let's get out of here.
Uh, we didn't think anybody lived here.
It was all his idea.
We thought maybe we could get out of the rain.
It looks like it's going to last all night.
It's pretty bad out there.
Oh no, you can't stay.
Oh, be reasonable.
You can't stay.
We might catch pneumonia.
You're not welcome in my house.
Go away, now, go, go, go.
Lobo!
Lobo! No, no!
The monster!
Now you believe those newspaper stories?
Do you hear that, lobo?
You're the monster.
Perhaps, one day you will meet the monster.
Heh, heh, heh.
Wait, wait!
I can't run anymore.
We gotta keep going.
That was the monster.
Well, I wouldn't give to see a couple of cops right about now.
Come on. you, get these straps off of me.
Let me loose, do you hear me?
Lobo hears, but he cannot speak.
Lobo is mute.
Because of the storm, I was afraid we were not going to have guests tonight.
Lobo, you're too rough with my patient.
Already, he tires of our humble hospitality.
I said, let me out of here.
At the moment, i am afraid it is impossible.
Who are you?
Vornoff, Dr. Eric vornoff.
The name will mean little to you. what are you doing to me?
You will be soon as big as a giant.
Strength of 20 men.
Or, like all the others, dead.
Turn off the switch.
Isn't it strange, lobo?
Our friend always returns home after his long, tiresome swim.
What's your name?
You find out.
We will.
Hey, watch that cigarette.
What were you doing in the swamp?
What's it to you?
That's enough of that, buster.
No tank town jail can hold me.
I'll be out of this here rat trap in 24 hours.
That's what you think.
Vagrancy will hold you for 72 hours.
Take him downstairs and book him.
All right, let's go.
Let go of me, I said.
You can't do that to me.
Let go.
Hey, where do you think you're going?
What do you mean, where do I think I'm going?
I've got captain
Robbins' newspapers.
You have, have you?
And since when you don't leave the captain's papers with me?
Since the captain told me to bring 'em in myself.
When you read 'em first, you mess 'em up.
Hold your tongue and give me those papers or I'll have you locked up for peddling without a license.
I got a license.
Want to bet I can make it expire all of a sudden?
Come in.
Here's the late editions, captain.
Look, why can't i work on this case?
Get back to your desk.
Yes, sir.
- And kelton.
Yes, sir?
I told the boy to bring the papers in himself.
Yes, sir.
But if you ask me...
I didn't.
Yes, sir.
- And kelton.
Yes, sir?
Where's lieutenant Craig?
In his office, I think.
Send him in.
Yes, sir, right away, sir. come in.
Hi, captain.
Hello, dick, sit down.
Seen today's papers?
Is there anyone who hasn't?
Well, there's the one nice thing about birds.
They never cause anybody any trouble.
Your girlfriend writes a good story.
She thinks so.
Anything new.
No.
12 disappearances around this place and nothing to go on.
And nothing this time either.
Been around that swamp so many times, I'm getting web-footed.
It's been fired recently.
It's been fired several times recently. jake long's wife identified it a little while ago.
The coat belonged to
Ralph mcrae, his partner.
They went hunting by marsh lake and never returned.
Not much left of it.
Boys found it floating in the lake.
What about the rifle?
About a mile from the old willows place.
All ties together.
But it doesn't prove anything.
You think there's anything in these monster stories?
Your girlfriend does.
What about you?
The police don't believe in monsters.
Facts are our business.
Facts and only facts, and don't you forget it.
I'm telling you, the captain isn't seeing nobody.
Now please be a good girl, miss lawton, and go.
Captain Robbins, will you tell this junior g-man to let me go?
Kelton.
Yes, sir.
Let her go.
Just as you say, captain.
It used to be a newspaper reporter could get information around this place.
What in the world do you mean?
Now, he makes like a comic.
Dick Craig, I don't put much stock in the future success of our married life if already you're holding out secrets on me.
You've been dodging me all day.
Where'd you get an idea like that?
You mean you haven't been dodging me?
No.
And all those times I called.
And kelton said the line was busy, it really was?
Yes.
Ok, let's have the story on lake marsh and the monster.
Uh... monster, monster... aaah.
I thought so.
There is no such thing as monsters, this is the 20th century.
Don't count on it.
Monsters, I mean.
Now, Janet.
Don't you "now, Janet" me.
And you can count our engagement off.
- You don't mean that.
Yes, I do.
No, she doesn't.
I most certainly do.
Well, then, give him back the ring.
What?
If you're throwing over the marriage, give him back the ring.
Now, chief, I...
Captain.
Give him back the rock.
It's the only fair thing.
I'd rather throw it in lake marsh first.
Besides, we've got to leave our personal lives out of our business lives.
As it should be.
As I've been saying all along.
Dog! Now, what about the monster story?
Well, that's your own story.
You wrote it and you're stuck with it.
There's no such thing as monsters.
But two more men have vanished up at lake marsh.
That makes
12 in three months.
Everything points to an inhuman violence.
Or do you still stick to the alligator devouring routine?
Oh!
You're withholding news from the public.
Janet, you may not believe this, but you got all the story there is.
You're right, i don't believe it.
Well, nevertheless, it's the truth.
Except for the monster, figment of your very vivid imagination.
While we've got nothing more to go on than what you reported to the paper.
The figment of my imagination is something I believe and you haven't been able to disprove it.
We've conducted every possible search.
Monsters, it's fantastic.
You know that.
Our business is dealing in facts, evidence.
Can't you see that?
Men disappearing. Huh.
There's plenty of quicksand out there.
Yeah,
12 went down in the same place.
Well, we're doing our best to solve it.
Maybe your best isn't good enough.
- Janet!
No, I mean it.
No clues.
What's this, a dancing costume?
And this, a pogo stick?
Well, I've got to admit those we're found at the lake.
But remember, they were in your own story.
No human did this.
So you say.
Well, looks like I've run into a dead end around here.
Ok, if you boys wanna play a game of secrets., there's nothing left for me to do but take a run out to lake marsh myself.
Over my dead body.
That could be arranged.
Goodbye.
She's just crazy enough to do what she says.
- You know what, captain?
What?
I think you're right.
Hi, tillie.
Hi, Janet.
Long time no see.
Tillie, do you remember a couple of years ago in the real estate section when the old willows place out on lake marsh was up for sale, against back taxes?
Seems to me that was around
November or December of '48.
- Wanna see the files?
Yes.
Just a minute.
Here they are.
October to December, '48.
In the top file there.
I won't be long.
Take your time I ain't going anyplace, and neither are they.
Find what you wanted, Janet?
Yes, thanks. Sorry to leave such a mess for you.
Well, that's what I get paid for.
Be a dear, tillie.
Call the boss.
Tell him I'll be gone the rest of the day,
- I'll report in later.
Sure thing.
On something hot?
Oh, it could be.
Oh, and dick.
Call him at headquarters, break my dinner date with him.
Tell him I... I have an ulcer or something.
Leave it to me. I fix.
Ok.
- Hi, Janet.
Oh, hi, Marge.
Janet. Still on the monster hunt?
What do you think?
I think the boss has been looking for you all day.
Something about the police wanting those monster stories 86'd.
You've got the whole town in a panic.
I didn't hear you.
- I said...
I know what you said.
But I didn't hear you.
I get it. See you later.
Lieutenant Craig has been working on the case a long time, professor.
I'd like him to hear what you just told me.
I should be happy to cooperate.
Oh, hello, dick.
Professor Vladimir strowski, lieutenant Craig.
Glad to meet you, professor.
How do you do?
Professor, will you bring him up to date?
Lieutenant Craig, have you ever heard of loch ness?
I think so. That's a lake in Scotland, isn't it?
Mm. Then perhaps you are familiar with the loch ness monster.
Vaguely.
A few years ago, I was called in by the British police to investigate the appearance of a monster at loch ness.
Well, they thought that it was some creature left over from a bygone age.
I am considered an authority on the subject of prehistoric monsters.
However, I must admit that my investigation failed to get the desired results, in that I did not see the monster myself.
But others did.
There are sworn statements.
Professor, is it your theory that perhaps the loch ness monster crossed the ocean and came to the swamp?
I consider that possibility extremely remote.
But the cases do bear a certain similarity, in that there are so many varied descriptions of this so-called monster.
And I thought perhaps, with my knowledge of such things, and with your permission, of course, that I might be able to shed some light on this mystery.
That is the reason for my presence here.
What do you think, dick?
Well, there's no denying we need help of some sort.
And you'll keep your findings secret for the time being?
As you will.
And you don't mind a little company?
How do you mean, company?
Lieutenant Craig.
At times, the police can be quite useful.
I should be most happy to have lieutenant Craig's assistance.
How soon can you be ready to leave for lake marsh, lieutenant Craig?
I'm ready.
Well, I suggest we wait until morning.
There was a storm brewing when I came in.
And it is so close to nightfall.
According to reports, the monster strikes only at night.
Undoubtedly true, but the preliminary investigation should take place in daylight.
The night, the monster, all in good time.
Sounds logical.
Whatever you say.
Now, gentlemen, since I just arrived in town this afternoon, if you will excuse me, i should like to return to my hotel.
Certainly, sir.
Good day, captain.
Professor.
Until morning, lieutenant Craig.
I'll be here.
Strange sort of bird.
Where do I meet him?
Here, ten o'clock.
That will give him plenty of daylight.
Well, see you later.
Hmm, got a date?
What do you think?
I'll say you don't.
I don't?
Girl from her office called in.
Said that Janet had a headache or some such thing.
If she's gone to lake marsh alone.
I'll take her across my knee, if it's the last thing I do.
Well, it probably would be.
Watch him, dick.
Strowski?
Just a hunch.
Right. you are all right now, my dear.
What?
Who... who are you?
I'm... I'm Dr. Eric vornoff.
You had a severe shock.
Oh.
How did I get here?
Oh.
That's not important for the moment.
What you need now is rest.
Rest.
You will sleep.
Sleep.
For the lovely young lady, sleep.
Well, here we are at the fork in the road.
Like they say in all good westerns, which way to go?
Well, that's the road to the willows place.
Let's take a chance on that one.
Ok. You know, i get to hate this swamp more every time I come out here.
You just weren't born for swamp duty, Marty.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I'd like to transfer to a department as far away from here as possible.
The wind and the rain.
Gives this place a gleam that just isn't natural.
The ground alive with crawling things, crawling death.
You're right there, Marty.
This swamp is a monument to death.
Snakes, alligators, quicksand, all bent on one thing.
Destruction.
Something strange about all this rain.
The lightning's been going crazy too.
Maybe it's like the papers said.
All these atom bomb explosions distorted the atmosphere.
Maybe.
You know, if I was this professor strowski guy, i wouldn't come out in this swamp without a guide.
You know, that's the one thing I can't figure.
He comes to the office with all these monster stories, makes an appointment to come out here with us, then he goes off by himself.
Are you sure he came out here?
Where else could he go?
Well, let's get at it.
Hm.
Janet's car?
Yeah, there's not a trace of her.
Well, maybe after the accident she found her way down to the road and then back into town.
I've gotta be sure.
Look, there's a coffee joint about ten miles back, let's go and check.
- Let's go.
Ok.
Where did you find her car?
Not a sign of her?
Where's strowski?
I told you not to let him out of your sight.
Right, captain.
I don't like the looks of things.
Well, get back to strowski.
I'll get word to you later.
Yeah.
You look worried, dick.
No one.
Captain Robbins, her apartment, her office.
No one has heard from her since yesterday afternoon.
Captain Robbins is checking further.
Ok, but what do we do?
Orders, find strowski.
Ah, get me the city desk.
Hello, Jim.
Yeah, about the lawton girl.
Uh, he just called me too.
Who saw her last around your office?
Don't be afraid of lobo.
He's as gentle as a kitten.
Put the tray down here.
 That is all.
Get out.
I said, get out! that is all.
Now come, my dear.
Some cream or sugar?
You didn't have your breakfast yet.
Now it's past noon.
You must be hungry.
What happened to me?
Your automobile, an accident.
Lobo brought you here.
To me.
What is this place?
And who are you?
Don't you remember i told you last night?
Did you tell me?
Yes, I'm Dr. Eric vornoff.
Oh. This is the old willows place.
Yes.
How did you know?
I checked our real estate files.
A Dr. Eric vornoff bought the willows place in November of 1948.
You are a newspaper reporter, huh?
Yes.
My name seems to mean much to you.
Well, actually it wasn't your name I was interested in.
Through the mysteries of lake marsh, and the willows place being right on the lake.
I looked in the files to see what happened to it.
Your name was there as the purchaser.
I thought perhaps you might have heard something about the monster.
Oh, my dear miss lawton. I...
When did I tell you my name?
You didn't.
But since you were unconscious, i took the Liberty looking into your purse.
You must have seen my press card.
Yes, I did.
Well, since you knew the answers already, why the third degree?
And who or what was that monster?
Oh, he's quite human.
I discovered him in the wilderness of Tibet.
He has been quite useful to me... at times.
But now, since your tiring experience, i think we have talked too much.
I'm not the least bit tired.
But you are tired.
You are so tired.
Strange.
Suddenly, I...
I do feel very tired.
Yes.
Very tired.
Very tired.
Lobo! Take the girl to my quarters.
My dear professor strowski.
Well, it has been a very long time.
Vornoff.
It is you.
You can see.
In Paris, i missed you by a month.
In London, a week.
At loch ness, by only one day.
The monster of lake marsh sounded again like you.
Why the sudden interest in me, professor strowski?
Your experiments in atomic energy, of course.
Ah, so my dear country now believes in my work.
And that it can be a success.
Our government wants you to return, vornoff, to continue your research and experiments there, where you can have everything at your disposal.
Why do you laugh?
Surely this is not a laughing matter?
My dear professor strowski.
20 years ago, i was banned from my homeland.
Parted from my wife and son, never to see them again.
Why?
Because I suggested to use the atom elements for producing super beings.
Beings of unthinkable strength and size.
I was classed as a madman, a charlatan, outlawed in the world of science which previously honored me as a genius.
Now, here in this forsaken jungle hell, i have proven that I'm all right!
Now, professor strowski, it is no laughing matter.
Yes. Yes, indeed it was a tragic error.
But, as soon as I had learned how correct your findings were, always have been,
I informed those in authority.
Vornoff, I have searched for you everywhere, everywhere I hear stories of monsters.
Now, I am here, sent to bring you home.
Home?
I have no home.
Hunted, despised, living like an animal, the jungle is my home.
But I will show the world that I can be its master.
I will perfect my own race of people.
A race of atomic supermen which will conquer the world.
Yes. Yes, of course.
A truly great master race, such as I convinced my superiors only you could create.
One with which our government can rule the world without debate.
You misunderstand me, strowski.
I don't intend to return home.
My plans are for myself.
Are you mad, vornoff?
One is always considered mad, when one discovers something that others cannot grasp.
Our government ordered me to bring you back.
I'm afraid you will find that rather difficult.
You see, vornoff, i did not come alone.
Neither did I, my dear strowski.
Bring him along, lobo.
Come, come.
Hurry!
You are a fool, vornoff.
You... you may... you may kill me, but others will come.
Silence.
You will never get away with this.
Put him in there.
Vornoff! Vornoff! No! No!
Help! Help!
Vornoff! Vornoff!
Vornoff!
Now, professor strowski, you will get a much closer view of the product of my genius.
The alleged monster of lake marsh.
Vornoff! Vornoff!
Vornoff! Vornoff!
Your country offers fame and fortune for my return, but my price is so much more great.
You will disappear, professor strowski, just as all the others have disappeared. vornoff! Vornoff!
It's a rental car.
Think it's the one strowski used?
I'd make book it is.
It's getting dark now.
You take the car, and go down to the beach.
I'll go through the swamp to the old willows place.
Ok.
Oh, here.
You'd better take this with you.
Right.
- Oh, Marty?
- Yeah?
You see anything suspicious, you know where I am.
Trouble is, everything in this swamp is suspicious.
What can I do for you, sir?
Captain Robbins, homicide.
Why, captain I haven't murdered anyone in a month of Sundays.
Did Janet lawton stop by here late yesterday afternoon?
Oh, just a like a policeman, no sense of humor.
Yes, she stopped by late in the afternoon.
Remember the time?
Well, not to the second.
She came in around two, and left around 3:30.
Then again, that isn't so late, is it?
What'd she want?
She was looking for information.
That I'm sure of.
Do you happen to know what that information was?
Well, sure.
- Well?
Well, what?
Must we play games?
I didn't know we were.
What was miss lawton looking for in the files?
Oh, well, why didn't you ask that in the first place instead of all your chit-chat?
She was looking over the real estate files in October, November and December of 1948.
In particular, the sale of the old willows place, out on lake marsh.
Did she find what she was looking for?
Well I guess she did. At least, she found the sales notice.
I saw it myself after she rushed out.
She left the paper open at the November 26th date.
Wanna see it?
Why, very much.
Well, it's right up there.
I haven't had time to put it back yet.
Yeah, Dr. Eric vornoff.
Give me all you have on him.
I'll hang on.
Are we ready for the girl?
Here.
Oh, lovely.
Strap her to the table.
Do as I command you.
I'll teach you to disobey.
You will obey.
Strap her in.
Strap her in, I command you.
Get the equipment ready.
It will hurt just for a moment, and then you will emerge a woman of super strength and beauty.
The bride of the atom.
You are insane.
My paper knows where I am.
You can't hurt me and get away with it.
As soon as my experiments are completed, no one can ever touch me,
I will make the law.
Either way, whether I succeed or fail, it will not hurt you very long.
Let me go! Let me go!
You heard what she said.
Who are you?
For one thing, the police.
Now turn her loose and make it fast.
You have the advantage for the moment.
Stop talking and turn her loose.
Dick.
Take him out, quickly.
Where's lieutenant Craig?
We found strowski's car down the road.
Lieutenant took off through the swamp.
Sent me down here to the beach to wait for him.
Where was he heading?
Old willows place.
- Kelton.
Yes, sir.
Now, this is your first time out.
- Don't mess up the operation.
Yes, sir.
I mean no, sir. martin, you stay with me.
Yes, sir.
Come on.
I'm sure my experiments on the young lady will interest you.
I'll live to see you hang.
There are much more important things to attend.
I hope the straps are not cutting.
Such lovely skin should not be marred.
Lobo, stop.
Stop. Stop, I command!
Stop! easy, Janet.
Janet, get me the gun.
Easy.
I've gotta stop him.
You can't, he'll kill you.
He probably will anyway.
Stay here.
Turn that thing off.
Lobo!
No! No!
Stop.
I beg you! stop!
Kelton, you station yourself here.
You men surround the house. martin, you come with me.
All right, captain.
- Ready?
Right. look, the place is on fire.
Let's get out of here before we get roasted.
Ca... captain, look!
What do you suppose that was?
Well, whatever it is, get it.
Oh, wait a minute.
Here comes dick.
He's got Janet.
Get him!
No, don't shoot!
You might hit Janet.
Let's go.
- Marty.
Yeah?
Give me a gun.
Here you go.
There he goes!
Can I suggest something, captain?
No!
Now get on up over that ledge.
Get up over on top of him.
That's what I was gonna suggest.
Well, stop the chattering.
- Get in action.
Yes, sir.
Now he's clear.
Give it to him.
I think it's broken.
Don't move, buddy. he tampered in god's domain.
He's cold.
We'll be home in a couple of minutes.
His teeth are chattering.
You gonna make friends with this one, too?
He is cold.
Come here.
He's relaxing.
He likes me.
Me, too.
Frank?
Patrick.
Aw, Jan, you know how much this means to me.
Get with it, will you, baby?
Frank!
Hey, Frank!
Oh.
No.
Oh, Frank.
Come on.
Ok, colonel. Ok.
Lay off. Stop it.
Ready for duty.
Always ready.
Yes, sir, colonel.
Jan, put on some coffee.
Don't I always put a pot of coffee on the stove before I pass out?
There's lots of coffee.
Oh, my dear
Dr. Schratt, you sober up with more grace than anybody I ever saw.
You're terrific.
Come on, let's go.
Are you kiddin'?
Look.
Nope.
Frank, don't let me down.
What's more useless than a surgeon with a hangover?
I'm a drunken zero.
I pass.
No, you don't.
I'd rather have you do a corneal transplant for me drunk than anybody else sober.
Let's go, boy.
You're brilliant, but not normal.
Heh heh. So are you, but are you, and who is?
Uhh.
Great.
Come on, boy.
Hit the showers.
Turn in your suit.
Get me a long carotid this time, will you?
Yes, indeed.
Clean to the last teeny pore.
Darling, junior's falling asleep.
Good.
Look, he's the first who's not scared.
That's a break for us.
Less problem with clots.
Pat, couldn't I keep him as a pet?
I thought I was your pet.
Set him on the table, honey.
He's so young, so trusting.
He trusts me.
Must be just a baby.
Pat...
The others were too old.
Maybe that's why we failed.
This is your fifth try.
It seems so pointless.
4 wasted lives.
Monkey lives, and is it pointless for animals to help save human life?
One soldier, one mother in an auto accident, one half-drowned boy, one baby girl feverish with freckles and a dimple.
You're right, darling.
I'm being silly.
Thanks, dear.
Now go make us one of those wonderful stews, will you?
She is really something.
So are you, pal.
Ok, you're on.
This is the day.
I feel it.
Me, too.
In about 30 minutes, we'll have a monkey brain...
Alive.
Well, yes or no?
Frank, the pump.
Now the motor.
Jan, check the oscillograph.
For the fifth and last time,
I hope, nothing.
Keep watching it.
Frank, up 5 microvolts.
An Alpha curve.
Faint, but it's here.
Up 5 more.
The curve's firm and normal.
Honey, take a look.
It's something, kids.
A brain without a body...
Alive.
It's wonderful.
Great work, Frank.
Congratulations.
Terrific, but
I'm glad it's over.
All set, darling.
Immediately upon removal,
2 electrodes fastened to cortical tissue.
If that's for me, I'm not here.
Hello?
No, Dr. Schratt's not here.
Well, I don't know about Dr. Cory.
Oh, hold on a minute.
Pat, it's the chief ranger.
There's been an airplane accident.
He thinks some of the passengers may still be alive.
Why don't they get Frank?
He'll be in town in a half an hour.
That half hour might save a human life.
This is Cory.
I'll be glad to help.
Where do I meet you?
I'll be there as quickly as possible.
Honey, take care of things.
Notes of everything, huh?
I'll watch every second.
Yeah.
Ok, boys.
Set him down.
He'll never make it to the hospital.
What about your place, doc?
It's only a couple of miles.
I don't think he has a chance, but it's worth a try.
Ok.
This way, fellas.
Still living?
Perfect.
Same as when you left.
What about the wreck?
Three dead, one survivor.
He's in bad shape.
Give me a hand with this, boys.
Put the head right over here.
Jan, give them scissors.
Easy now, fellas.
Fast as you can, cut away the clothes.
Tuttle, help with the sheet there.
You'll find 'em in the side drawer.
Better get Frank.
He's running a temperature.
I think he's asleep.
Wake him up.
Get him.
You pull him through, doc, you should be set for life.
How do you mean?
That's Warren h. Donovan.
Means nothing to me.
He's supposed to be worth a hundred million.
The sky's the limit on your fee.
Money can't help him now.
All right, boys.
Thanks very much.
That's swell.
You can go.
Frank'll be here in a minute.
Honey, we'll need your help.
Will you get the gowns and things?
Hurry up, Frank.
Why weren't you in your office?
The whole wide world is my office.
How bad is he?
Both legs completely gone.
His chest is crushed.
Tuttle, you better get into the hospital.
If we pull him through, we'll need a lot of things.
Right. I'll call you as soon as I get to town.
We'll know for sure by then.
We'll need adrenaline, and I'd start plasma right now.
Frank, you take care of the chest.
I'll do the legs.
Clamp.
Uh...
What's the pulse?
None.
I think he's gone.
Adrenaline.
Let Frank do it.
Right into the heart.
Not a flicker.
Try a massage.
Still nothing.
Any idea who the poor man was?
Some millionaire, name of Donovan,
Tuttle said.
Absolutely nothing.
Hmm.
Any ideas?
I wouldn't have wasted this much time.
All right, that's that.
Thanks for covering for me, pat.
Tuttle hates my guts.
He'd love to see his brother in my job.
Well, you go on back to bed.
I'll tell him you were sick.
Make out the death certificate first, though.
That's not my department.
Why don't I park
Mr. Donovan in the garage?
All right. Thanks.
Wait a minute.
Hold everything.
Watch the current, will you, Frank?
Jan, give us readings.
What's the big idea?
I'm curious, that's all.
What about it, Jan?
There must be something wrong.
There are indications of Alpha waves.
Not too unusual.
In violent death, like the plane crash, organs of the body die at different times, and his brain's still alive.
You're right.
The waves aren't weakening at all.
Come on, Frank, I think we have time enough.
Time for what?
Donovan's dead, isn't he?
Beyond all help?
So?
Science can use Donovan's brain.
Hurry, or we'll never make it.
You're crazy.
Count me out.
It's against the law to operate on a corpse.
It could mean jail.
And for what?
What do you hope to prove?
There's no time to talk now.
Either help me, or leave me on my own.
Please, darling, don't...
Believe in me, will you, baby?
Get the instruments out of the sterilizer.
Quickly.
The bottom tray.
You're wackier sober than I ever was crocked.
What an idea, stealing a man's brain.
Second success of the day.
To Patrick Cory, doctor of science, who plays miracle man on the side.
Now will you tell us why?
Jan, please, 40th minute...
Tissue regains color, complete recovery from surgical shock.
It's simple, Frank.
We have blood banks, bone banks, eye banks, corneal transplants from dead to living.
Jan, arteries resuming pre-operative state.
Add the time.
So what? Preservation of tissue is nothing new.
Why risk a jail sentence for that?
If this brain lives, maybe we can discover how it thinks.
Impossible.
It can't see, it can't hear, and it can't feel.
That's correct.
The brain itself can't.
That's why this one feels no pain even though it's still alive, but this brain contains all the knowledge and experience of Warren Donovan's entire life.
In other words, all his thoughts.
The impulses of these thoughts, then, must still be alive.
You're just guessing, aren't you?
Am I?
What do you think is registering on the oscillograph?
I'm a doctor, not an electrician.
For all I know, that thing would move even without the brain.
Let's see. Fluid level has dropped 2 millimeters.
Do you suppose it could be absorbing nourishment?
Promise me something, will you, pal?
If anyone ever asks any questions about this, you don't even know my name.
I promise.
Well, see ya.
Where are you going?
Still 11 bottles left in that case.
Why don't you take them home with you?
Good idea.
I'm supposed to be home... On duty.
Darling, what about the stew?
Oh, right now, but in here, please.
I'm not budging an inch as long as Mr. Donovan's brain is still alive.
72nd hour, third day.
Current increase...
2 microvolts.
Please, take it off the hook.
Well, let's face it, darling.
If you don't go to town,
Higgins is going to come out here.
Do you want that?
I told you I'd see him, honey, but not now.
Please, don't stop.
If that's Higgins, keep him in the living room.
I'll come out.
All right, but I'm worried.
Frank said there was talk of an autopsy.
How are you going to explain the stitches in his head?
I'll explain 'em.
Here are your chemicals.
Now will you forget that thing and come on back to town with me?
Are they performing an autopsy?
No autopsy yet.
It's just that this Donovan was a very important man.
The c.A.A.
Is investigating the crash, but the main thing is Higgins and Webster are after my neck.
Now will you come on back with me and get me off the spot?
Ok, pal, anything you say.
Just give me a few minutes to shave.
Take over, will you, dear?
Darling...
Wear a tie, huh?
If anyone thinks I was guilty of negligence, why not perform an autopsy?
We considered that, but Mr. Donovan's family decided it wasn't necessary.
Ah, Tuttle.
Tuttle, didn't you tell them we did everything we could?
There's no dispute about that.
Then why am I here?
Principally, with regard to Dr. Schratt.
Now would you say...
Would you say
Dr. Schratt was or was not in condition to perform his duties?
Dr. Schratt was in perfect condition to perform his duties, and he did.
When I tried to reach him, he wasn't at his office.
At Dr. Cory's, he smelled like a barroom, and Mike at the liquor store says he bought a case of that Russian stuff he lives on.
Caviar?
Tuttle, you're a fine ranger.
Why don't you mind your own business?
Mr. Webster, take my word for it.
You couldn't have a more capable person in your employ than Dr. Schratt.
Anything else, gentlemen?
Nothing more for me.
Mr. Donovan's son and daughter are waiting to meet you.
Of course.
I'll buy you a drink sometime, ranger.
What's your version, doc?
Did you know Donovan before?
I asked you men to cooperate.
I'll be back in a minute, fellas.
Please, get me on the way out.
Thanks a lot.
Ok, doc.
Mrs. parton,
Mr. Donovan, Dr. Cory.
Hello, doctor.
How do you do,
Dr. Cory?
I'm very sorry about your father.
Well, thank you, doctor.
My sister and I have been assured everything possible was done.
Believe me, it was.
Did dad say anything before he died?
No. He was unconscious when we got to the wreck, and he stayed that way.
I'd say he passed on very peacefully.
No pain.
We wondered if any papers fell out of his pockets.
Not that I know of.
Are you certain?
You notice anything?
No.
As I told you before,
Dr. Cory and I were concerned only with what we had to do.
We understand.
We're grateful to you both.
If there's ever anything we can do to show our appreciation, please call on us anytime.
By all means, do.
Thank you, I will.
Good luck to you both.
Fellas, I can't add a thing to what you already know.
What about the rumor that Tuttle's brother will replace
Dr. Schratt?
Quote, nobody could be better in his job than Dr. Frank Schratt, unquote.
That's all, boys.
Will you excuse me now?
Sure, doctor.
So far, so good.
Hiya, doc. My name's yocum, herbie yocum.
I freelance for a livin' with my little brownie here.
Came up on my own on spec to do a picture story on Donovan's death.
Well, where do I fit in?
He died at your house, didn't he?
Look, doc,
I'd like to get a shot of the operating table where he kicked off.
That's a little gruesome, isn't it?
Delicious.
The Sunday supplement's eat this stuff up.
I got some shots of
Donovan in the morgue.
What happened to his head?
It was a plane crash, remember?
He had extensive injuries.
Oh, come on, doc.
Give me a break.
If you do, I'll take some shots of your kids.
All right, yocum.
Do you want to follow me in your car?
Are you kiddin'?
The finance company took it 4 payments back.
Doc, you're my chauffeur.
I just added 5 ccs of serum, and there was a small deviation...
We'll talk about it later.
Hey, good lookin' lab you got here, doc.
Oh, a heart, huh?
Hey, a brain.
All right, yocum.
This is where Donovan died.
Take your picture from over there.
Yeah, sure, doc.
And include us out.
Got it?
One more, just in case.
Hey, how about doin' a story on your stuff, doc?
You know, it might be worth a couple of hundred dollars, and I'll split with you.
No, thanks. Uh...
What do you think you're doing?
Oh, doc, you're rushing me.
That one slipped.
You know, I just lost 6 cents.
That's what these bulbs cost me wholesale.
This one ought to do it.
All right.
Take him back to town, will you, please, Frank?
Well, thanks, doc, and if you're ever in Hollywood and need a favor, look me up.
Yocum. Y-o-c-u-m.
The only one in the phone book.
Bye.
How did you ever happen to allow a thing like that?
He wanted some pictures of where Donovan died.
He'd already taken pictures in the morgue, and I was afraid he'd get suspicious if didn't let him come here.
What were you saying now when we came in about a deviation?
Well, it was at 4:40.
I was checking the voltage.
Here comes another one.
This like the 4:40 one?
Yes.
Huh.
2 identical deviations.
Looks like a beta frequency.
Oh, it is.
The brain must be thinking systematically.
Darling, you watch the screen.
I want to try something.
It's another deviation, a bigger one.
Jan...
I feel we are about to stumble onto something very important.
For instance?
Well, I don't know for sure, but we know the brain reacts and reacts differently.
The next step is to find out what these reactions mean.
Specifically, which cells are responsible for thoughts, emotions, actions.
All right, but where do we go from there?
Now you're asking me too much too soon.
These answers may take years.
By the way, how's your Patience?
What do you think?
I think someday you'll be as famous as madame Eve curie.
Well, if I'm as useful to you as she was to her husband,
I'll settle for that.
You're just as useful...
And lot's prettier.
Oh, pat, please go take a nap.
Not now, dear.
You do the sleeping for both of us.
Let me have the notes, please.
Seventh day.
Brain's absorption of nourishment increasing approximately
1 cc per hour.
Growth and pulsations visible to naked eye.
These impulses!
They must mean something.
They must!
More notes?
No, not now, dear.
Pat, I'm worried about Frank.
Why?
He'll show up when he runs out of money.
Don't you feel a little guilty?
If he hadn't been here helping you, he'd have been home on duty when Tuttle called.
Wouldn't have lost his job.
Jan, when a teetotaler takes after a drunk, the drunk doesn't have a chance.
Tuttle's been after
Frank for a year now.
Sometimes I think you're a bad influence.
Why don't you discourage
Frank from drinking?
Oh, perhaps I'll cure Frank and every other alcoholic, if I can solve the mystery of Donovan's brain.
I think it's a matter of chemistry, how the brain thinks.
The problem is to find out what chemical combinations are responsible for success, failure, happiness, misery.
Sounds impossible.
But it isn't.
It can't be.
There has to be a way.
Pat, I wish you'd eat and get a good night's sleep.
Oh, there must be some way.
Now this oscillograph has shown us all kinds of reactions, but what do they mean?
Honey, are you really interested in reactions?
Are you kidding?
Of course.
Well, what about mine?
It looks like we're going to spend the rest of our lives here in this room.
All right.
I don't miss the fresh air, and my cooking smells like carbolic acid, but there's no place in here for you to warm my cold feet on these long winter nights.
I guess if we had about a hundred mirrors, we could watch the brain from every room in the house, couldn't we?
If you think it'll work,
I'll buy them.
Something else will work.
What?
We'll give the brain a voice, and we can hear it from anywhere.
Now who's kidding who?
No, no, no. Honest.
I'll show you.
Look, go get the portable radio, will you?
And the soldering iron.
And a ham sandwich on rye!
See, beautiful?
The same electrical impulses which move the oscillograph can be turned into sound waves.
This thing lets us see the brain think, and the amplifier and loud speaker let us hear.
If I only knew what it was thinking.
It sounds spooky.
Now when did we get superstitious?
I'm not really.
I'm just a little upset.
What about?
Well, now that that thing works, can we go in the other room, sit in front of the fire?
Sure, dear.
That's what it's for.
Welcome home,
Dr. Schratt.
Well, it's about time you showed up.
Can I live in your breakfast nook?
It's been made up for days.
How's the mastermind doing with his stolen brain?
Go take a shower, will you?
What's that noise?
Mr. Donovan thinking out loud.
Oh, very funny.
You look like you could use a shower and a shave and some sleep.
Thank you, Frank.
Pat's letting himself run down like a broken clock.
He won't listen to me.
Look, pal, I've got an idea...
The answer to everything you want to know.
You come along fishing with me for 3 days, and I'll solve all your problems for you.
All right, wise guy, let's have it now.
What you need is a nice big crystal ball.
Oh.
If you didn't have a beard,
I'd kiss you for that.
For what?
Crystal ball, that's it!
The next step...
Clairvoyance, telepathy.
You remember the experiments at Duke university.
One brain transmitting thoughts, the other receiving them.
Well, don't you get it?
Donovan's brain is sending out thoughts.
All I have to do is use my brain to receive them.
Oh, naturally.
Very simple.
Darling, will you do something for me?
Will you go into town and get back issues of magazines and newspapers?
I want every article that has anything to do with Donovan.
Every possible detail of his life.
Will you, baby, please?
Hey, you sober enough?
Will you drive her?
I'm beat.
I want to take that shower you sold me on and sleep.
I'm tired of this space-patrol junk.
All right, all right.
Darling, will you, please?
Sure.
Maybe there's something in the last issue of newsweek.
"Despite his millions,
"Donovan was notoriously antagonistic toward organized charity.
His huge..." hey, you read that one before.
Oh.
How about this?
"The government case against Donovan
"for income tax evasion
"has been in a legal snarl for years.
"Donovan carried to an extreme
"the independence of the self-made man.
"What belonged to him he felt was his and his alone.
"He scorned taxes, fought the payment of every penny.
"Treasury department experts refused comment
"on how the fact that Donovan left no will will affect the status of their case."
Jan, read that one again that gives his description.
"Donovan's strength was in his lined,
"granite-like face and piercing eyes.
"Nephritis had left him in poor physical state.
"He must have been in constant pain,
"because he generally walked with a limp, his right hand soothing his aching kidney."
Yeah, a lot of walking he did with 4 Cadillacs.
I can just see him now, hobbling from the mansion to his car, chewing on a $2 cigar and blowing smoke rings worth a nickel a piece.
Well, thanks for everything, kids.
Night, darling.
Frank.
I'm gonna catch us some nice fresh trout for breakfast.
Want to come along?
No, thanks.
Somebody around here ought to get some sleep.
See you in the morning.
Hey, if you happen to get a message from an old lady with white hair, that's my great aunt marta.
Say I'm out.
Hey! Anybody up?
Look.
3 nights in a row he hasn't been to bed.
She should have married a mattress tester.
Pat.
Hmm?
Pat?
Now, this is silly.
Why didn't you come to bed?
What happened?
A remarkable occurrence,
Dr. Cory.
A thoroughly exhausted man fell asleep.
Now, look.
Why don't we put this on a sensible basis?
Now that Frank's living here, we can take turns, and that way we won't miss a thing, and we can still keep our health.
You write this?
No.
Frank, is this one of your gags?
Did you pull this after I fell asleep?
No. So help me, pat.
How could I?
I was busy catching our breakfast.
What is it, darling?
Where's that picture of Donovan's signature?
I think it's in newsweek.
Newsweek?
Give us a hand, will you, Frank?
Here it is.
We've done it.
Contact with
Donovan's brain at last.
I wonder who Fuller is.
Hi, flower girl.
Finally remembered how bright the sunshine is.
I can't seem to make contact today, so I'm going to check around and try to find out who Fuller is.
I wish you'd stay close by.
Of course, darling.
Won't miss a thing.
Why aren't you in the laboratory?
I told you to watch the oscillograph until I returned.
Don't talk to me like that.
Well, then do as I tell you.
Why don't you stop fooling yourself?
You're not kidding me.
You don't believe that Donovan and Cory have arrived at a meeting of minds?
Not in a million years.
You're blind, Schratt.
Report, please.
Constant glow, same as when you left.
Fabulous. Look.
See the difference?
Now look at the oscillograph.
See? The brain is falling asleep.
That's good.
Let's go in the living room, hmm?
All right, dear.
Pat, Frank and I had a long talk when you were out.
Oh?
We decided that you're carrying this thing too far.
Too far?
Oh, darling, this is only the beginning.
Do you remember our conversation when you came in?
Conversation?
Hmm. Very vaguely.
And you think that's the sign of a healthy mind?
Look, pat, we're both doctors.
We understand autosuggestion, self-hypnosis.
Darling, don't you see?
The limp, the tone of voice.
You're imitating Donovan subconsciously, even to practicing his signature with your left hand.
Oh, Jan, please.
We read you every detail of Donovan's life, and you're so anxious to see this crazy experiment succeed...
What do I have to do to convince you both this Donovan business is on the level?
You'll never convince me.
I expect you any day to send me out for a box of $2 cigars.
You told us that it was an experiment, an investigation of human emotions.
It is.
A search for happiness.
It is all those things, but human emotions exist way deep in the mind.
So far I've only managed a superficial communication with the brain.
Oh, you're off your rocker, pal.
You're way past the brain.
You're looking for the soul.
You're out of your department.
That's why I tell you you're kidding yourself, and if you're not, if you are on the level, then you're trying to play god.
Oh, Frank.
You know I couldn't have gotten this far without...
God's help.
That wins this round, chum, but you wait.
Uh, did you measure today's increase in size?
No, not yet.
I better do it.
I'll be back in a few minutes.
He seems so Sincere.
The mind's a funny thing, Jan.
This Jekyll and Hyde thing, it's weird.
You want me to end it?
How do you mean?
You tell me when, and we'll have an accident.
A fuse in the garage will pop, and 5 minutes later, we'll bury Donovan's brain.
Much as I'd like it,
I want pat to be the one to say when.
Janice, pack my suitcase.
And I'll want the tape recorder.
Where are you going?
To the city.
Why? For how long?
When did you...
Please don't interrupt my train of thought.
While I'm away, increase nourishment to the brain...
Half a pint a day.
Frank, order a taxi, then call the airport and charter a private plane.
Yes, sir?
Suite 612, if it's not occupied.
612? It's available.
For how long?
A week at least.
Possibly longer.
Dr. Cory? It's nice having you with us.
Incidentally, the rate on 612 is 75 a day.
My friend Mr. w.H. Donovan said the rate would be 50.
Oh. That was for Mr. Donovan.
Confidential, we thought.
However...
However, the rate will be $50.
Have the boy take my bags upstairs.
I'll be back later.
Hi, doc. Remember me?
Hey, don't tell me you forgot herbie yocum.
Oh. Hello, yocum.
I just telephoned your house.
Thought maybe I'd run out and pay you a visit, but the missus said you were checking in here.
Call me here later this afternoon, yocum.
I'm late for an appointment now.
Yeah, sure.
You'll have to see the manager... Mr. mcnish.
Mr. mcnish?
Yes?
I was sent to you about this.
Effie.
You have identification, doctor?
Yes, certainly.
Effie, will you get me the signature card of the Roger hinds account and the ledger sheet, please.
Yes, sir.
Have you known
Mr. hinds long, doctor?
Does it matter?
Well, as a matter of fact, to my knowledge, he's never been in the bank.
Naturally, we're a bit curious about him.
All his deposits and withdrawals have been made by mail.
We all have our idiosyncrasies,
Mr. mcnish.
How do you wish to have this cashed, doctor?
Mostly thousands, some hundreds, and a few fifties.
Well, that will just about close the account.
I wouldn't know about that.
You have an office here in the city, doctor?
No, I'm visiting at the town house.
I see.
Well, here you are, sir. $27,000.
May I have an envelope, please?
Certainly, sir.
And if you'd care to open an account...
No, thank you,
Mr. mcnish.
Good day, sir.
Get me the treasury department, bureau of investigation...
A Mr. Brooke. Yes.
Do you have this equipment on hand?
Yeah, I think so.
I want immediate delivery to that address.
If you don't have a truck, hire one.
I don't know about that.
I'll pay double the usual hauling rate, with a $100 bonus for the men on the truck.
How much do I owe you?
I'll have to figure it out.
A rough guess will be good enough.
Well, I'd say, uh, with the tax...
It'd be pretty close to $8,000.
Your firm will absorb the tax, or I'll use my professional connections to make the purchase wholesale, understand?
Have the driver give the change to Mrs. Cory.
$50 of that is for you.
What can I do for you, sir?
I was sent by w.H. Donovan.
Do you have any blue serge with a thin pinstripe?
Yes, sir.
We certainly do.
We had just ordered a bolt especially for Mr. Donovan shortly before...
The accident.
I'll take half a dozen suits.
Certainly, sir.
I want the first one in the morning.
That's impossible, sir.
Not if you put one tailor on the coat, another on the trousers, and have both work all night!
Now, let's get on with my measurements.
Mr. Nathaniel Fuller, please.
Mr. Fuller is in conference.
He'll be tied up until after lunch.
Tell him a friend of w.H. Donovan wants to see him.
Say it's urgent.
But...
Go on.
Excuse me, Mr. Fuller, but there's a gentleman here...
A friend of
Mr. w.H. Donovan's.
Says it's urgent.
Who is he?
Dr. Patrick Cory.
Dr. Patrick Cory.
Cory?
Tell him to come back some other time.
Fuller, I have a message for you from Warren Donovan.
You'll see me now.
Sorry, Mr. Fuller.
Have
Mr. Cory come in.
The first door.
Now, Mr. Cory, what is so urgent?
It's Dr. Cory.
Mr. Fuller, I want you to put through a phone call to Mr. Donovan's
Washington connection.
Tell him to leave
Washington tonight by plane.
You and he will be in my suite,
612 at the town house, at 11:00 tomorrow morning.
I don't know what you're talking about, Dr. Cory.
Do you know who I am?
Frankly, no.
Mr. Donovan died in my home.
Oh, that's right.
No wonder your name sounded slightly familiar.
However, I doubt if Mr. Donovan's connection, as you refer to him, would drop his official duties and come out here on my say-so.
He will when you tell him that certain checks, endorsed by him, are in my possession.
He still wants them, doesn't he?
Now, see here,
Dr. Cory.
Yes, Mr. Fuller?
Do you recognize the handwriting?
Yes, but...
Then follow my instructions,
Mr. Fuller.
Aren't there certain checks with your endorsement, too?
See you in the morning,
Mr. Fuller.
Suite 612.
Get me the long-distance operator.
I want to make a person-to-person call to Washington.
Yes, sir.
612, please.
Yes, sir.
Room service?
This is 612.
Send up a thick steak, porterhouse, rare, charred, asparagus hollandaise, celery hearts, crisp, olives, large ones.
That's right.
No coffee.
No, milk.
Dr. Cory?
My name is Brooke.
Mr. Smith and I are investigators assigned to the treasury department.
May we come in?
Yes, come in. Yeah.
You gentlemen don't waste any time, do you?
Sit down.
You're right, doctor, and we won't waste time...
Ours or yours.
Where did you get the $27,000 check you cashed this morning?
I see no reason to answer that question.
That's a surprising attitude, doctor.
Well, ordinarily
I'd be glad to tell you, but it so happens the money is financing a research project of mine.
The backer said he'd withdraw if his connection became known.
Can you arrange for us to meet this Mr. hinds?
We'll respect his confidence.
Next time I see him,
I'll be glad to relay your request.
Well, doctor, we've been instructed to tell you a little more about this situation.
Thanks.
I'm not interested.
Would you be interested in finding yourself on trial as an accessory to tax fraud?
Prosecuted by the government of the United States?
If you'll give me your card, Mr. Brooke,
I'll have my attorney get in touch with you.
We'd appreciate that, doctor.
Oh, incidentally, what's your attorney's name?
It's unimportant.
He'll introduce himself when he calls.
Room service.
Come in.
Well, gentlemen.
We'll run along, doctor.
And please, we'd rather you keep in touch with us than for us to have to keep in touch with you.
It'll be ready in a moment, sir.
Hiya, doc.
Really living it up, huh?
What is it, yocum?
Remember, doc,
I told you I was broke?
Well, I wrote an article, and I think it's gonna get me a lot of loot.
You mean the one on Mr. Donovan?
Well, sort of, but I got a new slant on it, and it's a dilly.
How does that concern me?
Oh, I thought maybe you'd like to see it.
Good title...
"dead man's living brain."
Is the brain still alive?
Yes.
Say, that's good.
Some editor might want proof.
I can get 10 grand for that.
It's worth it.
Oh, you really think it's good, huh?
It's a good guess, yocum. That's all.
Ah, the public don't care about that.
And I got pictures.
Look.
Here's Donovan in the morgue.
I took the bandages off so you can see the stitches.
Here's Donovan's brain in your lab.
Gee, the missis looks pretty, doesn't she?
That's the one I thought was gonna cost me 6 cents.
Ha ha ha.
Yocum, why go off half-cocked on this thing?
I mean, why not forget this article for a while, and then when the experiment's completed,
I'll collaborate with you.
That's swell, doc, but what do I live on in the meantime?
Will you make me a small advancement?
How small?
Oh, say a couple of grand.
What makes you think
I have that kind of money?
I just happened to be around the bank when you picked up a bundle.
I see.
Pretty sharp, aren't you?
Yocum, have you ever been in trouble?
Not your kind of trouble, no.
You know, stealing a dead man's brain is quite a rap.
A cousin of mine's a lawyer.
He says it's a 5-year stretch, besides losing your medical license.
How do I reach you in case I want to get in touch?
Like I told you...
Yocum, herbie yocum.
The only one in the phone book.
Oh, and keep the copies.
I got plenty.
And picture negatives, too.
See you next week, pal.
Next month.
Well, that depends on how long this lasts.
Happy days, doc.
So long, partner.
Give me the desk.
This is Dr. Cory in 612.
Call Morton flying service and charter a plane to take me to green valley.
No, I'll keep the suite.
I'm coming back in the morning.
Hasn't it the slightest sign of decay?
None. I've never seen healthier tissue.
It's growing larger by the day.
I wonder if he'll be himself.
I doubt it.
It's my guess he's losing himself.
That's what worries me.
Look.
Hmm.
I wonder what effect it's having on him.
Let's go see.
Hello, Frank.
Darling.
Do you control it, or does it control you?
I wouldn't call it control.
I'd say I make my mind receptive, submit to the brain's will.
The brain takes over, that's all.
You know, a strange thing happened this afternoon.
I was sitting in front of the brain concentrating like you do, only, to tell the truth,
I was wishing that thing would die, when suddenly my head began to swim, and I had an eerie feeling that that thing was reading my mind.
That must be the equipment I ordered.
Dr. Cory?
That's right.
Aloe supply.
Oh, yes.
How would you like us to uncrate the stuff outside?
Why mess up the house?
Good idea.
I'll open the back door.
It's closer to the lab.
Ok, doc.
What kind of equipment?
Where did you get the money?
Oh, don't worry about that, dear.
Now, let's see.
There's an automatic feeder which can nourish the brain for a year, amplifiers for increasing the brain's output, a thermostatic temperature control, plus a generator and change-over gimmicks which can supply power in case something happens to the regular power supply.
Might as well get it installed now.
I don't like it, Jan.
He says he submits.
What happens if he can't stop submitting?
Oh, but could that happen?
Why not? That's why it has to stop right now.
Don't talk to him about it until morning, Frank.
He needs a good night's sleep.
It's a little late for talk, Jan.
Stop that!
Pat!
Pat!
Pat! Pat!
Pat! Pat!
What's the matter with you?
Have you lost your mind?
I'm sorry, Frank.
Give me your word not to interfere again.
I was only trying to save you from yourself, pal.
Did I ever try to stop you from having a drink?
This is different.
It's unnatural, unholy.
Well, if it is, then we'll let a higher power decide when it should end.
Cigar counter.
This is Dr. Cory in 612.
Send me some upman cigars.
Box of 50 supremes.
Send out and get them.
Come in.
Well, Mr. advisor himself.
Did you have a pleasant flight, sir?
Yes.
Well, sit down, gentlemen.
Make yourselves comfortable.
I'm sure we've never met, but there's something about you...
Perhaps it's the suit.
Would you gentlemen have some coffee?
That's it. The suit...
Like Donovan's.
But why, Dr. Cory?
Does it matter?
Now, then, it is my understanding that in exchange for certain considerations, you and your Washington connections would handle
Mr. Donovan's tax situation in such a way that...
Donovan's dead, Dr. Cory, and that seems to me...
As I was saying...
In such a way that the statute of limitations would ultimately cause the government's case to be thrown out.
Now you may talk.
Donovan's death released me from any agreement
I may have had.
You're mistaken.
Certain checks endorsed by you ensure that agreement.
Try to understand my position, Dr. Cory.
I felt dirty for many years.
Here was my chance to, well...
I went to my friend the Attorney General and offered to cooperate in exchange for personal immunity.
So you turned on your most powerful backer.
A very touching story.
Be that as it may, you will not clean your conscience at Mr. Donovan's expense.
Is that clear?
Come in.
Oh, yes, yes.
Thank you, thank you.
Cigar?
No, thank you.
Mr. Fuller?
Another reminder, like the suit?
You put it very nicely, sir.
Well?
The Attorney General cannot allow me to reverse my present stand.
That, of course, is your problem.
As I understand it, it requires a quarter of a million dollars to continue with the original plan.
The money will be in your office on the date Mr. Donovan said it would...
As usual, in cash.
I suggest, Mr. advisor, that you carry on.
Is our procedure perfectly clear?
Perfectly.
I'm glad we understand each other.
Gentlemen.
Operator, this is an emergency.
Get me green valley.
114, please, and hurry.
What?
The circuits are busy?
Well, keep trying.
It can't be busy forever.
Still busy?
Oh, Janice.
I've been trying to reach you, but the line is busy.
Darling,
I ache all over with pain, and I don't know why.
I don't know how long it's been, but I can't seem to break contact with Donovan.
Now listen carefully.
I don't know if I'll ever be myself again.
Oh, if the line would only open.
Well, keep trying!
Now, Janice, listen carefully.
I've got to break away from the brain.
I may have to do something desperate.
I... i don't know.
We have to end this thing.
We'll have to take a wild chance.
Now, you know the lightning rod on the roof of the house?
Taxi!
Turn right on Wilshire.
There's a gray sedan following us.
$100 if you lose it.
You got the wrong boy, buddy.
This is my bread and butter.
Hey!
Oh, darling.
Mrs. Cory?
Dr. crane.
Is he out of danger?
He's in no danger,
Mrs. Cory.
The concussion was very mild.
The leg was severely bruised and twisted out of joint.
Just minor injuries.
I doubt it if he'll be here a week.
I feel so much better.
Your husband's an amazing man.
He's shown absolutely no sign of pain.
Oh?
We like to minimize the use of sedatives.
I know.
I used to be a nurse.
The entire staff is baffled.
We can't understand.
I think pat does.
One day, he'll explain it to you.
If he can, he'll amaze me.
Well, Mrs. Cory, he seems to be waking up.
I'll leave him to you.
Darling.
What happened?
Oh, I'm in such pain!
Is this a hospital?
You were in an accident.
You'll be all right in a few days.
Jan, this is unbelievable.
It's very vague, but I think I deliberately walked into that accident.
But why?
I don't know.
To get away from someone,
I think.
I needed time.
Darling...
I'm a little scared.
Several times, I've tried to break contact with Donovan.
I haven't been able to.
I did once, I think.
I did some recording on the tape at the hotel.
Let me tell Frank to turn off the current.
The new apparatus may be too strong.
No. Have him turn it down
10 microvolts.
What are you doing here?
Why aren't you at home?
Why, darling, i...
Go on home where you belong.
Go on, get out!
I'll be there in a few days.
All right, pat.
Anything you say.
Hello?
Yes, I'll accept the call.
Hello, Jan.
Frank, I don't know what to do.
Even pat's worried.
He doesn't seem to be able to throw off the influence of the brain.
I was afraid that would happen.
The brain has hardly quieted down since he left.
He wants you to turn the current down
10 microvolts.
Do it, will you?
And do something else for me, please.
I'm going to stay here in the hospital waiting room.
The number of the phone is Adams 3-9105.
Call me whenever the brain goes to sleep.
I've got to talk to pat again when he's himself.
Sure. Good idea.
Will do.
Dr. Cory, we don't understand what you're trying to do.
Well, didn't mr. Fuller explain?
It made no sense.
Father's dead.
Don't you see?
Tom and I want to cooperate with the government.
They're entitled to the back taxes they want.
How dare you criticize my behavior?
Aren't we entitled to the truth?
It's a terrible thing to say, but dad was an awful man...
Better off dead.
His possessiveness, ugly suspicions, drove mother nearly insane.
He had her committed to an institution because she tried to take her own life.
It took his death for us to get mother out.
So, you hated him, too?
I loathed him.
Most people loathed him.
Get them out of here, Fuller.
See that neither of them gets another dime.
Impossible, doctor.
Not at all.
I have a signed document to that effect.
It'll be on your desk in the morning.
Now, you parasitic ingrates, get out!
Hey, doc.
I read about your accident.
How do you feel?
All right.
Gonna sue the company with the truck that hit you?
I hadn't thought of it.
Let me handle it.
My other cousin's an M.D.
He and the other cousin...
You remember the one I told you about's a lawyer...
They'll rig you up a great case.
You came here for that?
Well, not exactly, doc.
I figured on another advance.
How much this time?
Same amount. 2 grand.
It's been less than a week.
I know it, doc.
I was in hock up to my eyeballs, and I had to buy a car.
How long does this go on?
Oh, just till the article's published.
Tell you what, yocum.
Why don't you get your camera, drive out to the ranch, and take some more pictures of the brain.
Hey, that's a swell idea, and I need some closer shots.
You could leave right now.
I'll phone Schratt and tell him to give you a hand.
Swell, I'll, uh, get the money out of your pocket.
Ah, doc, you're a real pal.
Well, better get on with it.
See ya.
Give me green valley 114.
Jan?
Oh, hello, pat.
Good to hear your voice.
Where's Janice?
Why isn't she there with you?
We're out of groceries, pal.
She's gone downtown.
Now listen, Frank.
You know the photographer yocum?
He's on his way there right now.
Leave him in the lab alone, understand?
10 minutes alone.
Yeah.
The brain?
Perfect, great.
Bigger and better every day.
Good work, Frank.
Thanks.
There you are,
Mr. Fuller.
All cash, including your fee.
Phone Washington.
Say the money's on its way.
Very well, Dr. Cory.
Purchase the cemetery property tomorrow, and the day after,
I'll want to consult with an architect.
It's of great importance...
The construction of this permanent abode, or rather vault, which will perpetually house
Mr. Donovan's... Remains.
I'll do as you say, doctor, but this relationship of you to Donovan is so unnatural, so illogical.
Don't you think
I'm entitled to the truth?
The truth is always dangerous, Mr. Fuller.
In the Donovan situation, it entails great misfortune to all who know.
Believe me, your ignorance is insurance for personal safety.
Mr. Donovan intends to dominate the international financial scene, and a fatal accident will occur to all who happen to stand in his way.
Good day, sir.
A fatal accident will occur to anyone who stands in his way.
Frank and Janice...
They stand in my way.
Pat made that recording while the brain was destroying yocum.
That proves the brain can only dominate one person at a time.
But at the rate it's growing, do you think that'll always be so?
Who knows?
Honestly, Jan, we shouldn't wait.
Any minute now, that thing may get the power to paralyze us all.
You have another plan?
Mm-hmm, but I don't want to discuss it in here.
Let's step outside.
Why all the way out here?
I don't know.
I feel better outside.
Jan, pat may never get away from the brain.
It's up to us now.
But pat wouldn't harm us.
Donovan would... the minute we get in his way.
But murder... i can't believe that pat...
But yocum's death was no accident.
Donovan engineered it.
Then the same thing could happen to us.
Donovan could kill us the same way he killed yocum.
That's right, and it's too dangerous to wait any longer.
Now, when pat gets back home, it's up to you to keep him outside here.
Hold him.
Make him angry...
So angry the brain won't know what I'm doing.
Well, what's that?
I'll be in the laboratory.
Oh, it's a nightmare.
Do you think it'll work?
It has to, Jan.
The brain is very powerful, but we know it can only concentrate on one thing at a time.
We've proved that over and over again.
Frank...
What'll happen to pat?
I mean, if we kill the brain...
The brain is Donovan.
Frank...
Has Donovan become so much a part of pat?
I mean, could pat die?
Who knows?
This whole thing is beyond experience.
It's a gamble.
You don't have him now anyway.
Frank.
It has to be done, Jan.
Welcome home, darling.
Well, I'm happy to be here.
I've missed you, my dear.
My friend yocum show up?
Frank saw him.
Too bad about the accident.
Yes.
Tuttle told us they just found him.
How did you know?
I must've heard it somewhere.
I haven't seen you in so long, darling.
I mean, couldn't we take a little walk or something?
You look as though you haven't had a breath of fresh air in days.
A walk?
Of course.
The exercise will do you good.
Besides, you'll work up an appetite.
Please, pat.
Oh, but, Janice, surely it's going to rain.
And besides...
All right, my dear.
Let's take a walk.
Smell the rain coming?
How fresh the air is before a shower.
You know, Janice, you were always a very devoted wife.
Were?
But I still am.
And you've been a wonderful husband.
Thank you, my dear.
Oh, pat, look at me.
Look at me, please.
What?
Look at me, pat.
You can be free if you have faith.
Patrick.
What is this idiocy, Janice?
All right.
We can stop pretending now.
You're not Patrick Cory.
You're something evil living in his body.
But whatever your plan is, you'll never get away with it.
The experiment's over.
You're right.
It is over.
From now on, Warren Donovan is a living fact.
There's no further need for the instruments who gave him life.
The services of Schratt,
Cory, and yourself are no longer required.
Then you'll be the one to go, Mr. Donovan...
Just as you should've gone weeks ago.
No!
What are you doing?
No!
Let go of me!
Let go! Let go!
Let go.
Darling, are you all right?
Y-yes, Jan.
I'm so glad.
Let's go inside.
Frank!
Surprised?
You forgot, my dear, that you and Frank are ordinary people with limited mental capacities.
You couldn't possibly compete with a fully developed and powerful brain.
Thanks to
Dr. Patrick Cory,
Donovan's brain will live, thrive, and continue to grow far beyond the body of Dr. Cory.
It is already able to exist in anybody, anywhere at will.
Knowing this, you now know too much...
So look at my brain, my dear...
Your last look.
I promise you it will not be a painful one.
Ohh!
Good afternoon, Mrs. Cory.
Is the doctor ready?
He'll be right with you,
Mr. Brooke.
Is he feeling better?
Much better, thanks.
Good.
Um, Mr. Brooke, what do you think about...
I mean...
How long do you suppose he'll be gone?
Well, I'm sorry.
It's hard to say.
It depends on whether there's an indictment.
Well, they do know it was pat's plan to end this thing by hooking the lightning rod into the power supply.
They know that, don't they?
It's all on the tape recorder, Mrs. Cory.
Of course, a great deal will hinge on the decision of the medical board as to the ethics of the experiment and the validity of the results.
Well, we'll get turned around.
Mr. Brooke has the valise, dear.
Did you find the files on last year?
Everything...
All charts and notes.
We're covered on practically every minute since we first started research...
Thanks to you, dear.
Hurry back.
I'll try.
But they can't blame you... they can't.
Jan, I went into this with my eyes open, but it got out of hand, and I did many foolish things...
Things that made other people suffer.
I'm only grateful the storm struck when it did, and that Frank survived.
Will he be well enough to help you testify?
I hope so.
Maybe if everything works out, they can use another country doctor around here.
No, dear.
You're a scientist and always will be.
I love you very much.
Let's go, pal.
The history of the Haymarket Strangler. It's all here.
Five unfortunates lured to their doom...
half-strangled and slashed to death.
Here you are. Only a penny.
The history of Edward Styles, the Haymarket Strangler.
He terrorized the metropolis.
Five young women murdered in as many months.
The life story of Martha Stuart.
Only a ha'penny. An eyewitness account of the Haymarket orgies.
Martha's last night atJudas Hole.
Only a hapenny.
The life story of Edward Styles.
Five lovely young girls slashed to death.
Only a hapenny gets the infamous history of the Haymarket Strangler.
It's all here.
Five unfortunates lured to their doom.
No! But I didn't...
I never knew Martha Stuart!
I'm innocent!
You can't hang me for the murder of Martha Stuart!
Listen! I didn't do it!
You're getting your just deserts!
Cover him well over.
Quicklime is cheap enough.
We therefore commit his body to the ground.
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes... dust to dust.
Doctor Tenant's fainted!
Quick, give us a hand.
I've been back over the records and given you at least a dozen cases.
Why on earth choose this one?
It's the one clear case that'll prove my point.
If Styles had had the money to buy an adequate defense...
- He never would have hanged.
- Very well. Let's take this to my offce.
- There's more fresh air up there.
- Right.
I don't know why you social reformers always want to play detective to prove your theories.
Because you detectives always leave such gaps in your investigations.
Well, that doesn't apply to me.
I wasn't on this case.
- Now, then, what is it you want?
- There was a Dr. Horsely, the police surgeon on the case.
I'd like to see his report.
Ah, yes.
Yes, here it is.
I don't know what you expect to find.
If ever a case was proved, this one was.
Oh, no, Burk. There's nothing in Styles's life to show that he was capable of such violence.
Except for this.
Here's positive identifcation of Styles.
A dozen people saw him that night in theJudas Hole.
Why, one of them, Cora Seth, she still sings there.
It's quite impossible for her to have mistaken a one-armed man.
Is the knife still in the box?
You nearly had me that time.
- You know it isn't.
- No, and it never was found.
That's one of the gaps
I was talking about.
Here's what I want.
A young doctor, named Tenant,
Horsely's assistant.
Horsely sent him to do the autopsy on Styles's body.
Well, the law demands an autopsy on anyone who's died an unnatural death.
Tenant collapsed at Styles's graveside.
- Well, you said he was a young fellow.
- Young, perhaps, but not squeamish.
Look, it's all here. Five young women brutally murdered in the neighborhood.
- And the autopsy on all of them was performed by Tenant.
- What are you suggesting?
Why, that he might know as much about the murders as anybody else.
But I can't find him.
He never went back to Horsely... not even to collect the salary that was owed him.
Why did he disappear so soon after Styles was hanged?
It looks as though you're concocting some far-fetched theory out of your imagination.
Is it so far-fetched? I wonder if he knew that Styles was innocent.
I wonder if he was hiding something.
My dear Rankin, I've known you for an awful long time.
Allow me to tell you
I've never heard such rubbish in my life.
How can you call it rubbish if you don't even know why Tenant disappeared?
But I do. Look, it's all here in Horsely's report.
Here. Tenant was admitted at Guy's Hospital seriously ill.
It was from there he disappeared.
Where are you going?
To Guy's Hospital of course, to concoct another far-fetched theory.
Yes, here it is.
The third.
"Dr. Tenant admitted.
Brought in from Newgate Prison unconscious."
Ah, yes.
"Suffering from hallucinations, loss of memory... and some form of paralysis of the left side."
Here is an opinion that
"if the hallucinations...
"and attacks of paralysis with accompanying violence continue... he must be certifed and confned to an asylum."
- Is that what you want?
- It makes no mention of the fact of his disappearance?
It says here, "Dr. Tenant missing from his room. Authorities notified."
- And that's all.
- Only a note.
"In the event of any person claiming Dr. Tenant's possessions...
I have placed them in the lost property room, pigeonhole number 602."
If they're still there,
I'd like to see them.
Well, it's strictly against the regulations, of course.
- But should we look in the pigeonhole first...
- Thank you.
Ah, here we are, sir.
Safe as the day it was placed there.
Now, let me test my memory.
That'll be Dr. Tenant.
Yes, that's the one.
Quite a scandal there was about it at the time.
- We old ones still talk about it.
- Scandal? What sort of scandal?
Well, the young nurse who ran away with him.
The doctors all said he was mad.
She thought she knew better.
And when the asylum van came, no patient, no nurse.
- I never heard what became of them.
- Do you remember the name of the nurse?
I'm afraid you've got me there, sir.
Very quiet.
Very quiet and reserved she was.
- Do you have records that go that far back?
- It would mean quite a search.
It would be a great help if I could have that information.
And if I could borrow these things.
I should have to consult my superiors of course.
But I think it could be arranged.
- Will you come this way?
- Yes, thank you.
- Ah, good evening, Hannah.
- Good evening, sir.
- Has Dr. McColl come yet?
- Yes, sir.
He's in the conservatory with Miss Lily.
Shall I tell him you've come back?
No, I'll find him all right.
By the way.
How's that young scamp of a brother of yours?
Oh, sir, he's doing very well. He's got himself a job as a porter at Covent Garden.
Well, good.
That will keep him out of mischief.
Ma and I will never forget what you did for him, sir.
Well, no need for him to go to prison simply because he had bad friends.
Is that you, Jim?
Aren't they beautiful?
Now, don't frown. I've been most careful not to touch any of your precious papers.
- Thank you, my dear.
- Did you have a good day?
Splendid, I made great strides.
How much longer are these investigations going on?
I'm afraid the end isn't quite in sight, Barbara.
But it's all past.
That man was dead and buried
20 years ago. Let him rest.
I know I can't bring Styles back from the dead.
But one could force a change in the legal system... so that a poor man would have a lawyer to defend him.
Styles's was a typical case, and there'll be plenty of others.
- Jim, I realize how much...
- I must find this young assistant of mine.
By the way, we're going out again.
We won't be back for dinner.
- I wanted to talk to you about Lily.
- Later, dear.
Ken, you must never return to Canada.
- I couldn't bear it.
- Unless you come with me as my wife.
But that won't be for years.
Not until you've completed your studies.
Psychological medicine seems such a big thing.
Darling, it's new. When I win my diploma, think of the prospect... a new idea in a new country.
With you at my side, nobody can stop me.
I can't wait.
- Ah, there you are, McColl.
- Good evening, sir.
I'm sorry, Papa.
I didn't know you were back.
Evening, Lily. My boy, just give me a hand with this table.
As usual, Burk was most helpful.
Showed me the complete fle on the Styles case.
The trail led to Guy's Hospital where I found these things.
They belong to Dr. Tenant.
First of all, a letter.
- From Australia?
- Yes, from a sheep farmer named Temple... saying he can give him work on his station up-country when he gets there.
Then another letter from a shipping company... offering him a berth on a grain ship... but saying arrival in Sydney can't be guaranteed under six months.
And here's the actual ticket, unused.
- He never left England.
- Exactly.
And that's not all.
The usual paraphernalia... stethoscope, surgical dressing... and an instrument case from which a surgeon's knife is missing.
- I don't follow you, sir.
- What was the last case... that he was employed on before we lost sight of him?
- You mean the autopsy on Styles?
- Exactly.
An autopsy on which a surgeon's knife would be an essential instrument... also the perfect instrument for murder.
Excuse me, sir.
There's a cab waiting.
- Says you ordered him.
- Thank you, Hannah.
Get your coat, McColl.
Come on, giddap. Giddap.
As you will see, the contents of
Tenant's notebook are most revealing.
Intimate details of the killings of all fve girls.
Details that go far beyond an ordinary, routine report on an autopsy.
Why was he so fascinated by these gruesome details?
Well, he was young. Perhaps he took trouble to follow through on the cases.
- I would want to myself.
- I doubt that very much, my boy.
I regard it more as the abnormal, morbid streak... that is quite lacking in everything we know of Styles... but could be used to build a case against Tenant.
There is a point
I think you overlook, sir.
- Tenant had the use of both arms.
- I know, I know.
And the women were only half-strangled and then slashed to death.
Of course it's perfectly true
Styles was a one-armed man.
But we mustn't overlook the word
"paralysis" in Tenant's case history.
I see we're getting close to our destination.
- Where is that, sir?
- The place where the last victim was killed... and where Styles was caught and identifed... and the place that is mentioned so often in Tenant's notebook: theJudas Hole.
Would you give this note to Miss Cora Seth, please?
Certainly, sir. Would you be good enough to wait up there?
- My girls are good, eh?
- Oh, very, but...
I really came to see Cora Seth.
Oh, well, give her time.
Twenty years is a long while to think back.
- Miss Seth will be with you in just a few moments, sir.
- Thank you.
- Give us a song!
- Cora!
Hiya, boys.
- This him?
- Yes, it is.
- You're not the police?
- Purely private business.
That's different.
Your billet-doux about the Haymarket
Strangler gave me quite a turn.
I was only about 1 7 when I helped send
Martha Stuart's killer to the gallows.
- Oh, you're drunk!
- I'm not drunk. I've never been drunk...
And I shall never, never be drunk.
Take this lout away from me.
I'm soaked to the skin.
I don't think a handkerchief will be suffcient.
Where can I take you?
Bring my fan.
Pearl may be your prodigy... but you'll have to teach her to handle a man better than that.
She's young. She'll learn.
Well, don't stand there.
Bring it in.
Come on, girls.
Out of the way.
Come here. I haven't thanked you yet for taking that lout off of my hands.
It was a pleasure.
There. That was nice, wasn't it?
Come on, ducky. Over here.
- Well, sit down. No need to be uncomfortable.
- Thank you.
Well, now, Mr. Rankin.
What can I do for you?
Well, I'm a novelist.
I'm about to write a pamphlet based on the Haymarket Strangler murders.
- You mean Edward Styles?
- It's not about Styles I want to talk.
There was a young doctor here the night of the murder... a certain Dr. Tenant.
- Dick Tenant. He was here.
- You knew him?
Yes, he was always about, pestering us girls.
- Why do you say "pestering"?
- Well, you know.
In and out. Night after night.
Bottles of champagne.
I never knew why a young doctor like him should want to go rampaging around the town.
He didn't seem cut out for it, if you know what I mean.
- Well, as a matter of fact, I don't...
- A fne thing, Cora.
He rescues me, and I offer to thank him.
And what does he do? Asks for his friend who's talking to Cora, he says.
- The gentlemen are here on business, Pearl.
- Business? A fne story.
- What business have you got?
- My business.
And you wrap yourself up and get back to yours.
- Well...
- Go on! Don't you sauce me, you little bit!
You old trull!
Little baggage.
She won't come to much harm, a girl with spirit like that, eh?
We were talking of Dr. Tenant.
Was he fond of anyone in particular?
- He'd have liked to have been.
- You, for instance?
No. I wouldn't let him lay a fnger on me.
Why do you say that?
I don't know.
You can't account for feelings.
It was just something in the way he looked at you.
When he touched you, it was...
Anyway, he didn't want me.
It was Martha Stuart he was after.
The girl who was murdered?
Poor Martha.
I'll never forget that night, not as long as I live.
I was in here, you know. When I heard that terrible scream, I went rushing out.
And I was just in time to see that one-armed creature running away.
Are you quite sure that it was Styles?
- Are you calling me a liar?
- The face, did you see the face?
I didn't have to see his face. I could tell that one-armed outline anywhere.
What sort of a girl was Martha Stuart?
Funny thing, that.
She was as like Pearl as two peas.
Well, I've gotta change.
If you two gents don't want an eyeful, you'd better get out.
Quite, quite.
That woman's identifcation of Styles is worthless.
Exactly.
But what she had to say about Dr. Tenant is quite another matter.
Now, McColl.
I want his whole history investigated. just as thoroughly as we did with Styles.
Yes, sir.
Barbara, you didn't wait up for me?
I told you, dear.
I want to talk to you.
So you did. I'm sorry, but in the excitement of the evening, I quite forgot.
- Jim, what I wanted to say is...
- I know.
- That I shouldn't go on wasting my time.
- No, it wasn't. But I will say one thing.
You shouldn't meddle with things that are outside your knowledge.
You mustn't, Jim.
You mustn't. I beg of you.
I'm sorry, Barbara, but a man must do the work in which he believes.
I'm sorry, dear. All I ask is that you don't overtax your strength, make yourself ill.
I won't. I've nearly fnished. And then I can turn the summaries over to McColl.
It's about him I want to talk.
He and Lily like each other very much.
Barbara.
You see a romance everywhere.
Now surely you didn't wait up just to tell me that.
I did. Lily's spoken to me about it.
- I think she's in love with him.
- Well, in that case...
I'll just have to give the young man enough work to keep him occupied.
And so far as I'm concerned, dear...
I promise you that very soon
I'll settle down again... and write another long, three-volume novel... suitable for the most genteel of young women.
And my last inquiry, sir, was at the medical school.
Tenant's examination results were brilliant, but he was an erratic student.
Well done, McColl.
So there we have it.
A father who beat his son unmercifully.
A mother who drank and didn't care.
Interrupted studies, but a brilliant mind... and carousing in places like theJudas Hole.
Where we find that at least one woman refused him...
- And another couldn't bear his touch.
- Yeah.
He'd have a need to revenge himself.
Five times over in cold blood?
Perhaps he had a compulsion to kill.
Afterwards, in his lucid moments... he might bitterly regret his actions.
He might even forget them altogether.
You mean he killed while he was in some sort of a trance?
I can only theorize, sir.
Yes, but it's a theory that applies to a man... who had intermittent attacks of paralysis and great fts of violence.
Well, I can't contradict you, sir.
He was trying to cut himself off from his old life by going to Australia.
Perhaps in an effort to rid himself of the compulsion to kill... he discarded the knife that had become the symbol of the murders.
- Well, it's an explanation, sir, but...
- Where was the last place that he would've had the knife?
Well, I suppose he had it at Styles's autopsy...
- Before the burial.
- Exactly.
So the knife must be hidden in the most obvious place.
- Where?
- You can't deny it, McColl.
In Styles's coffn.
I tell you, Rankin.
I can't accept your theory.
My commissioner would throw me out in the street if I were to present such fiimsy evidence.
In any case, it's pure supposition.
A lot of psychological hot air.
Give me that, McColl.
Is that supposition?
I ask you, where is the knife that should lie in that groove?
- Was this Tenant's?
- It was.
Again I ask you, where is the knife?
Well, it's not the first time a surgeon's lost a scalpel, is it?
How dare you disparage my opinions!
I'm going to find that knife and hold it under your nose and make you apologize.
I demand that...
- Mr. Rankin, don't.
- I will say it, McColl.
Burk, I demand the exhumation of Edward Styles's body.
I'm sorry, Rankin.
But please don't drive me too far.
And don't make a fool of yourself.
I'm going to make an offcial demand for the exhumation of Styles's body.
If you won't help me, to whom shall I make it?
Well, if you must, I suppose the governor of Newgate Prison. But I warn you...
Good day to you.
And I'm sorry I can't add thanks.
- You had no right to admit him.
- I gave you the letter, sir.
Well, let him wait.
Take it back with my compliments...
And see him off the premises.
This way, sir.
- Sir.
- Who are you?
- I sent you that letter in all good faith.
- I never read such nonsense in my life.
To exhume a prisoner sentenced and executed 20 years ago... for the whim of a scribbling novelist.
- I stated my reasons quite clearly.
- Reasons? That claptrap?
I tell you, I knew the man.
I had the privilege of seeing him go to the scaffold.
And if ever a blackguardly ruffan deserved his sentence, it was Edward Styles.
I'll not let it rest here.
I'll go to higher authority. I warn you.
Oh, you're warning me?
All we had was the condemned cell.
It isn't everyone what can stomach a whipping.
I was talking to the governor.
Where is he?
Now, now, take it easy, sir.
You've had a nasty turn.
You're free to go whenever you like.
The previous occupant wasn't so lucky.
His nibs instructed me to return this letter.
- He did, did he?
- Begging your pardon, sir.
The governor acquainted me with the contents.
Of course, he ain't a free agent.
He's hemmed in by rules and regulations.
- You follow me?
- I think I do.
Do you know the location of the grave?
Do I? I helped to bury him.
Packed him in quicklime, I did.
He was a lovely ft. We couldn't get him in till we got his clothes off.
- Not half an inch either way.
- Please.
They don't use that graveyard, not once in weeks.
Now if someone was to let you in the gate late at night...
- Someone what knew where the coffiin lay...
- Are you suggesting that you would...
Of course, there'd have to be a consideration for his trouble beforehand.
There'll be no trouble about the money, but how can I be sure that...
I thought we were speaking as gentleman to gentleman.
There's your letter.
Be off with you.
No, wait a minute. Wait.
Must you go on working, Ken?
Yes, darling. Your father expects these summaries by the morning.
You never seem to have any time for me anymore.
Now, darling.
You know that's not true.
McColl!
When I gave you the freedom of my house,
I expected you to observe certain decencies.
- Well, sir, I was going to...
- But, Father, we're going to marry.
Really? I thought it was customary for a young man to ask permission.
Father, you must have known. Mother said she tried to talk to you about it.
I've no real objection to your joining my family, McColl.
But I do wish you'd said something to me.
It's bad enough being blocked and frustrated by the authorities at every turn... without having you add to my anxieties.
We had no such intentions, Papa.
I'll see that he works harder than ever.
He'll have to if I'm successful tonight.
- Do you want me to come with you, sir?
- Thank you, no, McColl.
You can't help me.
Ken, I'm so happy.
I think he means to give his approval.
I'm not so sure. Since the day we went to Burk's offce, I've...
I've lost his confdence.
- I disagreed with him.
- Then first thing tomorrow morning...
- Tell him how sorry you are.
- Yes, I will.
- But I must talk to Burk again.
- Yes, but not now, Ken.
No, not now.
You've got three hours, so you'll have your work cut out.
Wait a minute.
I'll be back at 2:00.
And mind you're gone. You'll find a spade over there in the corner.
But, Mama, why should I wait so long?
Your father hasn't yet told me that he approves, Lily.
And in any case, dear, it was very wrong of you... to encourage Dr. McColl without speaking to me in the first place.
Now run along upstairs.
I'll come and talk to you presently.
Please, mum.
Shall I lock the front door?
No, Hannah, not yet.
Mr. Rankin isn't home.
- Did he say where he was going?
- No.
But I expect it's some meeting to carry his investigations further.
Did you see that young man sitting at one of the tables just near to us?
Oh, lovely.
Pearl! Pearl, where are you?
Pearl, can you hear me?
Oh, shut up, Cora!
What do you want?
Come and do me up.
I'm getting too fat.
All right.
I'll be over in a minute.
Open up, dears.
Where's this from?
Quiet. A present from Major Fortescue.
Yeah, he sends his compliments... and he said he wants you all to join him in fresh bottles...
When these are empty.
- Good night. Come again soon.
- I shall, my Pearl.
You give an edge to a man's inclinations.
Next time I shall bring you a stone to match your name.
Oh, two.
Set in gold.
I'll have one here...
And one here.
Pearl! I can't wait all night!
Oh, shut up!
You'd better go, otherwise Cora will miss her entrance, and then London will never be the same.
George, see His Lordship off.
- Good night.
- This way, sir.
And about time too!
Can't you learn to keep your big mouth shut?
Now, you listen to me, my girl.
Until you're a great deal older and I'm sure you can pick 'em right... you're gonna stay right here under my wing.
Not if you're gonna spoil the chances I do get.
You nearly lost me a pair of pearl earrings.
Pearl earrings.
Before I've fnished with you... it'll be diamond necklaces.
You be patient, my Pearl.
- I'll make you the toast of the town.
- You're a good sort, Cora.
With you looking after me,
I'll do all right.
My fan.
- Right. How do we look?
- Gorgeous.
If one day I can equal it,
I'll be very happy.
You will, my love. You will.
Tell George to put a bottle of stout in my room, eh?
All right. I will.
Now Cora is a lady
I'm a girl what's doing well
I deal in nothing shady
I've got too much to sell.
It's very plain for all to see
I've got a heart of gold
So, join the queue
Enjoy the view
I'm big, I'm bad, I'm bold
All the boys adore her
She's always ready for a little bit of fun
With a duke or an earl or a younger son
But if you've got the wherewithal
To treat her as you should
For a diamond bright
She'll cuddle up tight
And maybe a little bit more-a
Cora, Cora
All the boys adore her
She's always dining with the la-di-da
And makin' 'em pay for the caviar
But if you take her fancy she won't ask you for a sou
But play your part
She'll give her heart
And maybe a little bit more-a
Now, Cora likes a dandy
A chap what's doing fiine
I'm not averse to brandy
In fact, it's quite my line
Of course I wouldn't drink a lot
I'm such a careful girl
I wouldn't blot
My copybook
Not even for an earl
Who are you?
Who let you in?
Cora
How all the boys adore her
She's always ready for a little bit of fun
With a duke or an earl or a younger son
For a diamond bright
And maybe a little bit more-a
All the boys adore her
She's always ready
It's the Haymarket Strangler!
Stop him!
Stop him!
Pearl!
You should have stayed in bed, Jim.
You're not ft to be up.
I'm sorry I frightened you, Barbara.
It... It was a nightmare.
I didn't know I was shouting.
You must let Dr. McColl examine you, dear.
You're not well. I know you don't want to worry me.
I don't want to worry anybody.
But the proof of my theories is almost within my grasp.
I know now that Styles was innocent. jim, give it up.
I beg of you with all my heart. Don't go on.
I must go on.
I can't give it up.
The man may still be alive.
I know who he is.
I know his name.
It's Tenant.
I must go to Burk. I must make him believe me. They must all believe me.
I have the proof.
Sir, there's a man here from Inspector Burk.
He wants you to join him at theJudas Hole.
Last night a girl was murdered.
Half-strangled and stabbed.
Have him wait.
I'll go with him as soon as I'm dressed.
Yes, sir.
Jim... Are my pleas useless?
Do they mean so little?
I'm committed.
I can't turn back now.
Oh, Jim.
Terrible. A young girl like that.
Everybody in the place saw the man.
The resemblance was so marked that Cora started the cry of the Haymarket Strangler... and the mob took it up as they set after him.
What can I do to help?
This is your fault.
Why did you have to go stirring up the dead?
If you'd let Martha lie peacefully in her grave...
Pearl would be alive now.
This is your doing, Mr. Rankin.
Now, Cora...
Cora, come on. Pull yourself together.
These hysterics aren't gonna help anybody.
Come on, Cora.
Try and remember what the man looked like.
I don't know anymore.
I don't know.
It was just as though
Styles had come back to life again.
It was the same man.
The very same man.
I'd tell you that if you brought me face-to-face with him now.
It was the Haymarket Strangler.
Is she right?
Would I have been wiser to let the dead rest?
I have no opinions about that, but your theories have been proved right.
There's too much similarity for this to have been coincidence.
- Rankin, are you prepared to cooperate?
- In any way that I can. This man must be stopped.
I want you to come to my offce.
For 20 years, this man's been amongst us.
Something you've either said or done has stirred his brain.
It shouldn't be diffcult to point to him now.
Burk. Any news?
Have you traced them?
No, we've been over all the early ground, but we might just as well have taken your word for it.
I've been over these papers over and over again, but the trail always ends at Guy's Hospital.
I'm on my way there this evening to go through the records, see if we can find the name of that nurse.
- Might be able to trace her.
- How can you?
The authorities were notified.
They couldn't find the runaways.
I know, but it wasn't a matter of so much urgency then.
- Burk.
- Yes?
There's one more line of investigation that I must pursue.
- I'll come with you.
- No, go on with what you're doing. This is an intimate matter.
If I'm right, you'll know soon enough. jim, where have you been?
I've been waiting and worrying.
I've been working with Burk at Scotland Yard... trying to trace the murderer of that young girl.
Tell me about it in the morning, dear.
You must get some rest.
I haven't seen you like this since...
Since when?
When did you see me like this?
Barbara, I've never pressed you on this point.
You've made me content to live as a man who only knew half of his life, but now I must know.
You must tell me.
Who is the man you took from Guy's Hospital?
Don't ask me that, Jim.
Is it an answer that I know myself?
The inevitable end of my search?
That I myself am the man that I've been hunting?
Of course that's it.
I've known it for days and been afraid to face the truth.
Why did you do it?
My only crime has been to love you, Jim.
Then out of your love, pity me and tell me.
When they brought you to the hospital, I did pity you.
You were so young.
And in the periods when you were yourself... so gentle and kind.
Always when you were in my care.
I fell in love with you.
I was a young widow with a baby to care for.
Lily... thinks of you as a father.
- What else did you know about me?
- Nothing. Nothing at all.
You were to be certifed.
I couldn't believe that you were insane.
- You took me away?
- Yes, I did.
And I encouraged you to start a new career as a novelist.
It was a fearful risk, but...
I had to create another man.
Always afraid we might be discovered.
I didn't know then that you were a murderer.
Now that you do?
The decision's no longer in my hands, Jim.
I tried to warn you... begged you to give up these investigations.
Fate has a strange way ofbringing retribution, Jim.
Styles will avenge himself on me as... well as on you.
- But I'll not desert you.
- No.
Leave me alone.
I'm mad.
Styles, the poor wretch, would have no use for a surgeon's knife.
But... Tenant would.
He was a doctor.
They're crowding in on me.
Styles and those women.
I must get to Burk before... jim, what is it?
What's the matter?
No. Don't.
I don't know where on earth he could have gone.
He was in my offce till pretty late last night, then he left to carry out some inquiries of his own.
He seemed very upset. And how on earth are we gonna tell him about this?
And this on top of everything else.
I'd like Dr. Johnson to have a look at him.
Perhaps you can make him see reason.
- I'd be glad to, McColl.
- Excuse me, sir... but I've just seen Mr. Rankin coming down the street.
Well, thank you, Hannah.
Why, Burk, what are you doing here?
Rankin...
I've got something dreadful to tell you.
Your wife was found dead in your study last night.
She'd been strangled and... and then stabbed.
Hannah said she caught sight of the murderer as he was leaving last night.
So that's what happened.
Burk, I must talk to you alone.
- Not in there.
- What difference does it make?
That is where she lay?
I told you you shouldn't have come in here.
Doesn't matter.
Burk, you must arrest me.
I killed my wife.
Now, look, Rankin.
You've had a dreadful shock.
Now, we'll find Tenant before long.
I am Tenant.
I've suspected it for a long time... but last night my wife gave me the proof.
You must not make such preposterous statements, Rankin.
I killed her with the knife that was missing from the instrument case.
It was here... here on the desk.
But how could you have found the knife?
You wouldn't help me. I found it myself.
I found it in Styles's coffn.
That's just your writer's imagination.
How could you possibly have dug up a body at Newgate Graveyard without somebody seeing you? It's pure fantasy.
The turnkey.
The turnkey who let me in. He saw me.
And the people at theJudas Hole.
- And now it's theJudas Hole.
- They'll identify me.
- Except that it wasn't you they saw.
- Hannah.
Hannah saw me.
Let me face Hannah.
Where is he, Ken?
He's in the study with Burk.
- Lily. I want you to meet Dr. Johnson.
- How do you do, Miss Rankin?
He's promised to look at Mr. Rankin in the hope that we can persuade him to rest.
I hope you succeed, Doctor.
Hannah, will you come in the study a moment, please?
- I was just gonna get Mr. Rankin his breakfast.
- Afterwards, Hannah.
Yes, sir.
I don't understand.
Why should anyone want to hurt Mama?
What are you trying to do, trap me?
I'm not used to telling lies.
Nobody's trying to trap you, Hannah.
You're here at Mr. Rankin's own request.
That's so, Hannah.
Now, isn't it true that...
Now, Rankin, you mustn't put words into her mouth.
- Now, Hannah, who was it you saw?
- I don't know.
- Was it Mr. Rankin?
- It was too dark to see properly.
He was more like a beast than a human being.
- Not a gentleman like Mr. Rankin.
- Thank you, Hannah.
- Hannah, I know you think you're trying to help me, but...
- Thank you, Hannah.
There you are, Rankin.
A girl who knows you well couldn't identify you.
But the knife...
I had it here in my hand.
- Did you show it to anyone?
- No. You sent for me to theJudas Hole before...
The Newgate turnkey.
He'll know me. He must.
He let me into the cemetery.
Very well, Rankin, if it'll humor you.
Yes.
Why, sir, this is the gentleman what visited you in the house of correction.
- All I need...
- I'll ask the questions.
Did you admit him to the prison again?
What reason would I have, sir?
A respectable gentleman...
I want a straight answer.
Yes or no.
- Never set eyes on him since, sir.
- Th... That's a lie!
You took me in the side gate.
You led me to the cemetery.
You should remember.
I paid you well enough.
Are you accusing this man of accepting bribes?
Sir...
I came to you with an unusual but perfectly reasonable request... and you refused it out of hand.
I had to find the knife to prove that Styles was innocent.
And I did find it!
How can you deny that you let me into the cemetery?
I'm sorry, sir. I'd help if I could.
Upon my soul, I would.
- Why, you lying dog!
- That'll do.
Steady, Rankin. Steady.
I ask you, sir, how could I get him into the cemetery without my mates knowing anything?
- Just ask them, sir.
- The grave.
The grave where I found the knife.
The earth is still fresh.
Lie as he will, he can't explain that away.
There you are, sir.
Fresh earth.
See for yourself, sir. jim Moxon, the child murderer.
We buried him last week.
- Now you're satisfed?
- It's a trick!
You changed the headstones.
This is Styles's grave, I tell you!
Governor, I demand another...
- Leave him to me. Steady, Rankin.
- Burk! He did let me in.
- I did find the grave.
- Rankin, steady.
- You must help me!
- Rankin, steady.
- I thought it was...
- I've asked Mr. Rankin to remain at the Yard.
- He's excited and not at all himself.
- After what Hannah told me, I'm not surprised.
That'll do, Miss Rankin. He's under the impression that he murdered your mother.
And that's only the beginning of it.
Naturally I don't believe this any more than you do.
- Has the doctor seen him?
- He's with Dr. Johnson now.
I want you to return with me. We must get him into a private home before anything else happens.
Obviously a case for observation.
- Coldbath Fields?
- No, there'd be diffculty about that... because, see, he's not actually a criminal lunatic.
Besides, it was the request of the daughter and the assistant that I examined him.
But an obsessional type... and dangerous.
I'd certainly prefer to have him under lock and key.
I'm just as sane as you are!
My daughter had no right! You can't commit me!
You speak as if I was suggesting some hole-in-the-corner abduction.
Naturally the certifcate will be signed by a justice of the peace.
Anything we do is purely for your own good.
You... You'll never get me!
You'll never put me in...
Get a van from Coldbath Fields.
And I must get a message to the superintendent.
I'm signing the order for commitment.
The man's a maniac.
No, no.
Take your hands off me.
You've got no right to...
Send for the inspector.
- Let him go!
- What's the meaning of this?
- Release this man immediately.
- Burk, you know me better than anybody.
You can vouch for me.
Put a stop to this.
- Here's the committal order, sir.
Properly signed by the justices.
- But this is ridiculous.
I'm afraid this paper's in order.
- I'm afraid Johnson's within his rights.
- Burk, you can't let them!
- You're not going to...
- If he goes, I go too!
Lily, it won't rest here.
You stood there and watched while they dragged him off to that terrible asylum.
- He attacked the surgeon!
- And what had they done to him before that?
Miss Rankin, this is not helping.
I'll get the commissioner to revoke the order, and we'll get him into a private home.
- Now you get down to Coldbath Fields and see what you can do.
- Right.
Come on. Time to eat.
No! No! I don't want it!
I don't want it! No!
- Company to see you.
- Burk?
- No, it's that doctor friend of yours.
- McColl. What does he want with me?
- Come on. We can't just stand talking.
- No! No! No!
Don't do it. Don't.
- You had no right to put him in here.
- You're seeing him on his best behavior.
Mr. Rankin, it's Kenneth McColl.
- I'm arranging to take you away.
- Why bother? You and Lily wanted me put here.
Mr. Rankin, if I'd known this was going to happen, I'd never have agreed.
You both wanted me out of the way!
You see? You're frightened.
I'm dangerous.
I did strangle those women.
Pearl, Martha Stuart.
Mr. Rankin!
McColl, I curse the day I ever saw you.
If I ever get my hands on you!
You'll not get away just by slamming this door!
Where's Burk?
Send for Burk!
I must have Burk!
He'll believe me!
I am Tenant, I tell you! I am!
I strangled those women!
I must prove it to you!
I'm glad you're here, sir.
As medical superintendent of this asylum...
I want you to authorize Mr. Rankin's transfer to a private home.
My dear sir, the man is a certifed criminal lunatic.
I admit he's unbalanced, but he's not a criminal.
He attacked me. If that's not a criminal assault, perhaps you can supply a name for it.
Mr. Rankin is a friend and a collaborator.
I know the stress he's been working under.
He's suffering from a violent psychic upheaval... possibly a projective identifcation with the murderer.
Without a proper examination,
I wouldn't like to put a name to it.
- Words, man. Words.
- You have to take the whole case history into consideration.
- With proper treatment...
- I don't agree.
I only know that the so-called treatment he's been getting here may do him lasting harm.
Do you think you can cure a diseased mind by... by brutality?
What are you doing?
Get your hands off!
Well, here are the papers.
I had an awful time getting the signature.
There wasn't as much diffculty putting him into the asylum.
- Dr. Johnson raised the objections.
- Admittedly there was provocation...
- But it's not right to put a man in Rankin's condition into a padded cell.
- No.
Anyway, thanks, Superintendent, for all you've done.
I take it you've made arrangements with a private home.
- Yes. I'm taking him straight from Coldbath Fields.
- Good.
I'll convince him that Lily bears him as much love as if she were his own daughter.
When Lily White Sand he heard the news
His eyes ran down with water
Said he
In love I'll constant prove
For I'll not live very long after
They both agreed to married be
Upon next Easter Sunday
But ratcatcher's daughter she had a dream
She'd not be alive on Monday
She went once more to buy some sprats
And tumbled into the water
And down to the bottom all covered in mud
Sank the ratcatcher's poor little daughter
- Have you seen him?
- Seen who?
- The escaped lunatic.
- Course I've seen him.
He's hiding under the spuds.
Want to look?
You can wipe that silly grin off your face.
He's put paid to poorJack Billins.
Spoiled his looks for life.
- Straight he has?
- We were right on him. He was coming this way.
Well, I ain't seen no one, and I've been here all the time.
He's not in there.
There's only potatoes in there.
Well, if you hear anything, holler.
Come on.
Holler? I'll scream bloody murder.
For I'll not live very long after
So he cut his
- What will they do to him?
- They'll catch him, of course.
I only hope they'll let him enter this private home.
Then perhaps, with treatment, he'll overcome this obsession.
They won't. They'll take him back to Coldbath Fields.
- It'll kill him.
- Darling, there's little we can do.
He thinks we're responsible for putting him there.
But we can't turn our backs on him, Ken.
No, darling, we can't.
We'll do everything in our power.
But as soon as it's over...
I'm going to take you to Canada.
- Have you found him?
- No, we haven't. The search parties are still out.
- Hunting him like some wild animal, I suppose.
- Miss Rankin, this is a matter of public safety.
If I'm right, he may return here. You and
Miss Rankin may be in very grave danger.
- Where's the maid?
- She'll be here soon.
You guard the front.
Keep an eye on the road.
- You, come round the back with me.
- Right, sir.
I'm convinced that knife's in this room somewhere.
But I don't understand. Why should he want to return here to kill us?
My dear, this is something beyond all our comprehension.
I had a talk with that injured attendant... and it seems evident that Rankin underwent some actual physical transformation.
- You speak as ifhe were possessed.
- I believe that he is.
You mean that somehow he released some evil spirit from the grave?
No, not that.
A side of himself he can't control.
A dual personality that, without the knife, is incomplete.
I can understand all that, but how do you account for this paralyzed arm?
It's a physical manifestation.
A sort of paralysis associated with what is going on in his mind.
I don't understand.
He was always so kind and gentle.
But your men searched this room.
It must be here somewhere.
Stay here. Don't move.
Hannah, what happened?
It was him.
Quick! Into the house!
Get out!
Forgive me, Lily.
Those faces, they haunt me.
I tried to kill you.
Mr. Rankin... you'll have to come with me.
Yes.
The knife.
It must go back to the grave.
I must put it there.
It's too late, Rankin.
I charge you.
- Bury this knife.
- Shoot.
Hold it!
I'll see the knife's destroyed, Rankin.
No use, Burk.
It belongs here... with me.
