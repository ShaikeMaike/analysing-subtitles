Ladies and gentlemen, the hundred yards race has been won by the sports mistress of our local high school,
Miss Caroline Trewella.
- I lost my bathing cap.
- you won the race, though.
- That was just luck.
- Proud of you, Caroline!. Proud of you!
- Congratulations, Miss Trewella.
- Thank you.
Now you've won the cup for the third time, you've won it outright.
I know that I'm speaking for everybody here when I say...
- Caroline's lucky week.
- yes.
Jolly good show, her aunt leaving her that house in Cornwall.
Pity it's in such an outlandish place, though.
She's frightfully thrilled about it.
- If they don't hurry up, she'll miss her train.
- Uh-oh.
TANNOY.. The next train from platform 3 is for Penzance, calling at Westbury, Taunton,
Exeter, Newton Abbot, Plymouth,
Liskeard, Bodmin Road, and all stations to Penzance.
What a rush!
(Flatly) I hope you have a nice weekend at Smuggler's Rest. you sound as though you do.
It's a ridiculous waste of money to be travelling first class.
It's a long journey and I wanted to relax.
Oh, well.
Have you got sandwiches and things?.
- I'm going to have a meal on the train.
- Isn't that rather extravagant?.
Caroline, the more we save now, the sooner we can get married.
That is what you want, isn't it?. yes, Ronald.
Good. Here is the newspaper for you.
- Thank you.
- It's all right. I've finished with it.
I should hope so. It's yesterday's.
Goodbye.
Bye.
GUARD.. Pencarrow!. Pencarrow!.
I can manage.
Pencarrow. Pencarrow.
Passengers for Pencarrow get out here.
Thank you.
Tickets, please. All tickets, please.
- Is there a porter?.
- No, miss. No porter tonight.
- Could I have a taxi, then?.
- No taxi neither.
How do I get to a house called Smuggler's Rest?.
Smuggler's Rest is up along, about three quarters of a mile.
- Oh, dear.
- I'll carry it for you, miss.
Thank you.
I'll make it worth your while.
That's very kind of you.
Hello.
That's Smuggler's Rest up there.
Now, here we are.
Oh, yes, thank you.
Thank you very much.
Well, isn't it enough?.
Quite enough, miss.
- Miss Trewella.
- Ah, Mrs Forster. you're very welcome, miss, I'm sure. you've got a look of the Trewellas, bless you.
- Good evening, Mr Jeffrey, sir.
- Good evening, Mrs Forster.
I've just been doing my good turn for the day.
Very kind of you indeed, sir.
If ever you feel like a little fishing,
Miss Trewella, I shall be delighted.
Any time.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mrs Forster.
- Well, now, this is most attractive.
- Oh, I am glad.
Mrs Forster, who exactly is Mr Jeff...?.
Mr Jeffrey Saunders, miss.
One of the richest gentlemen hereabouts.
- I thought he was a fisherman.
- He does fish. It's his hobby, like.
I see. you know, I haven't been here since I was a child. you won't find things change much round about here.
It's funny. That picture's the only thing that I can remember.
She's the lady that enticed your great-grandfather down to the sea.
Was he drowned?.
Not exactly, but they do say he was sunk the moment he set eyes on her.
Ah. There's a lot of nonsense talked about mermaids in Cornwall.
Hello, boys. Thirsty?.
- Good evening, sir.
- Evening, Mr Jeffrey.
- Two more pints, Charlie.
- Right, sir.
- How are things?.
- Bad, Mr Jeffrey, bad.
Last night's catch was the worst this year.
I reckon there's a shark of some sort round abouts.
- Why?.
- No fish.
And the gulls won't rest on the water.
They always know, all right.
Besides, Old Rundle saw something funny out in the bay.
Oh, I saw it all right. I saw it all right, Mr Jeffrey.
A great big shiny tail.
Like nothing I'd never seen before.
- Was it after closing time?.
- (Laughs)
Now, have I seen everything?.
- yes.
- What's here?.
That goes down to the old smuggler's cave, but the steps are all fallen away.
- Have you been down?.
- No! I don't want to break my neck.
It ought to have been bricked up years ago.
- Is that the sea?.
- yes.
It makes strange noises sometimes.
At night, most particular.
- What do you mean?.
- Well, sort of eerie sounds.
Almost inhuman.
M- m-m-m-m-m-ruh!
M- m-m-m-m-ruh!
Gracious!
If you're nervous, you're welcome to sleep at my cottage.
It would take more than echoes to make me nervous.
I'm sick of playing this dreary trumpet.
It's no good being nervous. It's nothing.
It is! I've heard it twice.
Is anybody there?.
Hello.
But you're me! you can't be.
I'm Miranda. Who are you supposed to be?.
I don't know.
Oooh!
Berengaria, be quiet. Submerge. you're a Trewella, by the look of you.
I'm one, too.
The wrong side of the blanket, of course.
I was born on the ocean bed.
The ocean bed?.
But... then you're a mermaid!
Naturally.
Look.
- See what I mean?.
- But you can't be. There aren't any.
Is she a Trewella?.
Oh, no. Between you and me, she's a bit simple.
Her mother was frightened by an octopus.
Poor thing.
As a matter of fact, she's a silly creature, but she's always been my accompanist.
I think I'll come ashore.
We must have a mutual great-grandfather.
That's right.
Old Matthew Trewella was terribly gay.
He used to take my great-grandma on dry land sometimes.
As a matter of fact, I've been on dry land also.
How did you manage?.
I had a whale of a time!
I met the most lovely men. Do you know any?.
I'm engaged to one.
Has he got pretty legs?.
I don't think I'd call them "pretty".
Well, then, you must get another one.
Do you like being a mermaid?.
It's dull at the moment. All the men are away.
- The mermen, of course.
- yes. They've gone to a coral convention.
They go every year for two weeks.
Would you like to come into the house and have a talk and a drink, if your husbands or friends are away?.
Wouldn't you think it strange to have a mermaid in the sitting room?.
Not any more. It seems quite natural.
Rather fun to have a fish in the family.
I think you're a darling.
It must be lovely to be you.
Caroline, would you let me be you, just for two weeks?. I'm so lonely.
But how could you?. What about your...
I'd wrap it up and go as an invalid.
Well, I did half-promise a friend to go on a cycling tour.
I suppose you could take my place for two weeks.
But who would look after you?.
There's a nurse in London who looked after me last time.
She understands my little ways.
Nurse Carey.
- Come in.
There's a young lady to see you, Nurse.
- Put it on the table, please.
- I said a young lady, Nurse.
- What?.
- A young lady to see you.
Oh?. What's her name?.
- Miss Trewella.
- Miss Trewella! Miranda!
But you're walking. you've grown legs!
How do you do?. I'm afraid I'm not Miranda.
Not Miranda?. But your face, your voice...
We have the same family tree, it's just that Miranda is the underwater branch.
Incredible.
I've just come from her.
She needs your help.
- Needs my help!
- She wants to come on land again.
The darling creature!
She shall! She shall! She shall!
Hello, Mrs Forster.
I hear Miss Trewella's coming back.
Morning, Mr Jeff. Morning, George.
That's right. Tomorrow afternoon.
I thought I'd better give her one of these as a peace offering.
Ooh! What a beauty! This'll cheer her up.
- Here's one for you, Mrs Forster.
- Thank you very much, Mr Jeff.
Poor girl's had an accident. Did you know?. yes. She fell out of them parallel bars, whatever they may be.
- Is she badly hurt?.
- It's her legs.
She won't be able to walk for some time.
Well, if there's anything I can do...
She'll need someone to carry her round. yes. Thank you, Mr Jeff, but she's bringing a trained nurse with her.
Good morning.
- Hello, Mrs Forster.
- Oh, Miss Trewella! My poor dear!
Where are my boys?.
Where's the porter?. Ooh, there you are.
That's right.
- Just put the bags down there, will you?.
- No trouble, madam.
Thank you very much.
- One moment, my man.
- It's a pleasure.
- There we are. Thank you very much.
- Thank you, madam.
Oh! Take care! Take care!
Those are my dear, darling boys.
Are you sure you're going to be all right?.
Well, I shan't be quite myself for the next two weeks.
- (Tuts)
- Nurse Carey.
Coming, Miss Trewella. Coming!
- This is Mrs Forster.
- How do you do?.
Oh, dear. A pussy.
Where will our sanctuary be?.
- Well, your room's in there, Nurse.
- Thank you very much.
Naughty pussy! you mustn't!
I'll be going.
The meal's all ready. See you in the morning.
Thank you.
Does it shine?. I want it to look wonderful.
If I went on shore, I should have a perm.
But then I never shall. you're really much more fish than I am.
I know.
I've only to sit on a rock for ten minutes and I get landsick.
I only get lovesick.
I think men are so beautiful.
Huh! Men!
The only one I ever trusted tried to harpoon me.
Fabulous!
Oh, what a miraculous cavern.
Miranda! Miranda! We're here!
- How blue the sea is.
- We've come to fetch you.
- So, this is her home.
- Be careful, now.
I'm very sure of foot. Oh!
Thank you.
I'll get her rug.
Miss Miranda!
Miss Miranda! Here I am!
Nurse! I knew you'd come.
Of course I came.
Oh! you pretty thing!
- But where's the other young lady?.
- young lady?.
She's down there shrimping.
Berengaria!
Nurse Carey - Berengaria.
Oh! How do you do?.
How do I do what?.
Well, just how do you do?.
I like your bonnet.
Do you?.
Couldn't you make one out of seaweed?.
Would you wear a cabbage on your head?.
No, perhaps not.
Very interesting, of course, but not quite a lady.
Here comes Miss Caroline.
Ready?.
We'll wrap you up and get you up to the house.
Goodbye, Miranda. Keep your tail wet.
Bye-bye, Bere! oodbye!.
I'd better take a change of shoes.
Even if it pours, Viola cycles through.
Camping with the girls.
What a waste of a tent!
Miranda, you must behave. you're supposed to be me and you're engaged.
Come along, dear, come along. you've a long cycle ride ahead of you.
Miranda, please be good.
I'll be better than good.
I'll be the best they've seen here for years.
Nurse, you must look after her.
See that she doesn't get into any hot water.
(Laughs) She could hardly do that, eh?.
Don't you worry, you just look after yourself.
I should be clear of the village by daylight.
If only all our British girls were as brave as you.
See you in two weeks' time.
On! On, Britannia!
Well, she's gone.
The poor, buttoned-up creature.
Isn't it funny to think that
Great-Grandma was in this very house?. yes, yes, yes.
The dear, pretty soul.
What a pity Miss Caroline's having to sell the house.
Sell the house?.
Why?.
Financial reasons, dear.
Besides, very soon she's going to get married.
But why can't they come and live here?.
Her fiance is some sort of engineer, and he's got to work in London.
What's he like?.
Well, look.
- hardly bursting with sex appeal, is he?.
- None at all.
Still, I dare say he's very dependable.
Dependable, my tail!
I'll hook a better one than that for Caroline.
- Nurse!
- yes.
- Open up the wardrobe.
- yes, yes.
Oh, my!
How awful!
No wonder she only caught Ronald, with that for bait.
Let's see what else there is.
Ah, here we are.
Here's something a little less refined, rather more chic.
It's too hot and it wouldn't show enough of me.
- Now, Miss Miranda...
- We must buy some new ones. yes, yes, but what about the money?.
I've got plenty in the cave below.
Berengaria will give it to you tomorrow morning.
Oh, good, good, good.
Arise and shine!
Hello, old trout.
Old trout yourself!
I want Miss Miranda's breakfast.
Well, here it is!
Steady on! I'm not a seal!
She wants me to fish up her ditty box.
Catch.
Pandora's box.
Ooh, look at this.
That belonged to my great-granny.
Oh, poor soul.
- I fancy that.
- A little too big for you.
Perhaps it is.
This looks more like you.
Oh, how lovely!
For a grand occasion.
The cat's whiskers.
- Can I keep it?.
- Certainly..
Thank you.
Good gracious!
What are all these coins?.
- Doubloons.
- Spanish doubloons?.
But you'll never be able to spend them.
Can't we exchange them somewhere?.
I don't think there's a pawnbroker's in this village.
I don't want to get my clothes in this village.
We've got to go to Torquay.
Good, good, good.
Here we are.
I've never been inside one of these places before.
I'd like to go in alone, please.
Would you, dear?.
I do hope they won't cheat you.
Don't worry, I'm used to dealing with sharks. yes, very well.
Good morning.
Good morning.
What lovely curls!
Are they permanent?.
They've been with me ever since I can remember.
They must be such fun to comb. yes.
Er, what can I do for you?.
- Think of something nice.
- Is there something you fancy in the window?.
Not in the window.
I want to sell these.
Oh, yes, of course.
Old gold.
- Spanish?.
- They've been in my family for years.
Well, they're worth quite a lot of money.
Would you like ready cash or would you care for me to arrange a credit with your bank?.
They'd be most surprised if you did.
Oh, really. Which is your bank?.
- The Dogger.
- The Dogger Bank?. yes.
We must get on, dear.
We've such heaps to do.
He's bought them. Isn't he sweet?.
- Charming.
- Oh, it was a great pleasure.
- Bye.
- Goodbye.
I didn't think he'd take them.
He can't have seen anything like those before.
He can't have seen anything like me before.
Well, no, of course not.
Now, clothes!
Christopher Columbus!
She's off!
What delicious abandon.
- Thank you.
- It's been a pleasure.
- Are you having trouble?.
- yes, we are.
- Let me help you.
- Thank you very much. you're very strong.
It's a pleasure.
I knew the late Miss Trewella.
Oh, I'm always early. you never know what you'll miss if you're late.
My name is Sutton. Barclay Sutton.
- I shall call you Barclay.
- yes, please do.
May I introduce my fiancee,
Barbara Davenport?. We're distant cousins.
The distance is merely relative.
I was afraid you were his wife. you teach at St Hilda's, don't you?.
Kensington?.
- That's right.
- My uncle, Sir Felix, is one of the governors.
- you know him?.
- I'm his favourite mistress.
- We're going to be close neighbours.
- The closer the better.
The Hall is half a mile from your house.
- yes, you must come over and see us.
- Sometime.
- Is tomorrow soon enough?.
- By all means.
- Why don't you come to dinner?.
- I'd love to. How do I get there?.
I'll come and fetch you in my car.
- Oh, I love motoring.
- you can hardly call half a mile motoring.
- It all depends how fast you go.
- If you please.
Until tomorrow, then.
- Goodbye.
- Bye.
She's oddly ingenuous, isn't she?.
I should say she was just odd.
We must be nice to her.
She's having a rough time.
From what I can see, I should think she would like it to be even rougher.
I'm sorry to keep you waiting, but the most extraordinary thing has happened.
Someone's put six Spanish doubloons in the collection.
- They're pretty rare, aren't they?.
- Museum pieces, Colonel.
- Have you any idea who it could be?.
- I can only think it must be Miss Trewella.
- That's where we settle.
- Don't you love the Colonel's moustache?.
- yes. Very handsome.
- He reminds me of a walrus I once knew.
My late husband had a moustache, a ginger one.
I used to trim it with my surgical scissors.
- Did you like it?.
- It was rather ticklesome.
Sometimes it retained the froth from his ale.
- How lovely!
- Oh, no, it wasn't.
I hope Caroline likes them because the Colonel would make rather a good match.
He evidently thinks you most fascinating.
Shall we add him to our list of possibles?.
A very good beginning.
But he's not the only pebble on the beach.
Can you see that beautiful man there?.
- I should say so.
- I could fall for him hook, line and sinker.
- Hello!
- Miranda, please.
- Good morning, Miss Trewella.
- He knows my name.
- Isn't he beautiful?.
- yes, yes.
- I'm sorry about your accident.
- yes, it is trying.
If I could walk, I could come down there and see what you're doing.
I can soon remedy that.
Ooh! How intrepid.
Be careful! She's rather delicate.
Oh, don't take her down there.
Mind how you go! you might lose your foothold!
Don't slip on the mackerel.
Hello, old gentleman.
Hello, missy.
Would you be a darling and go and keep my nurse company?.
Aye, I would.
It's a long time since I kept company, but once you know how, you never lose the knack.
- How's that?.
- Perfect.
The young lady sent me up to keep you company, nursey.
- Oh, she did, did she?.
- But I came willing, all right.
- Do you mind if I sit down?.
- you seem to have sat down, don't you?.
I love your legs.
What's your name?.
But you know. Jeff Saunders.
I like you, Jeff.
- Does my pipe worry you?.
- Well, no. I like the smell of good tobacco.
Oh! (Coughs)
Perhaps you'd hold that skein for me, would you?.
- yes, ma'am.
- Thank you.
There we are.
By the way, who's that young fisherman down there?.
He's no fisherman. He's a gentleman.
What?.
And very rich, they say.
Oh, well, that's splendid. Is he married?.
No. I reckon he's too wise.
I don't know what you mean by that.
He'd rather make several ladies happy than one miserable.
Oh, yes, I see.
I suppose that's rather level-headed.
(Chuckles) I'm glad you like my tobacco.
I don't like it all that much.
It's not a brand I'd choose to smoke myself. you feel wonderful. you're different, somehow.
Different?.
From the last time we met.
Oh, yes.
Do we know one another very well?.
Hardly very well.
Don't you think it's about time we got to know one another better?. yes.
Another little titbit, Rupert, my love?.
Morning, miss.
Morning.
Thank you.
There. How are your legs this morning?.
I can't feel them at all.
Morning, Nurse. Lovely morning. yes, indeed.
- My boys are glad to be alive.
- your breakfast is in the dining room.
Thank you, Mrs Forster.
I'll be out in a minute or two.
Sausages and coffee.
Salt water and shrimps.
Lovely!
Thank you, Nurse.
Two lunches.
Two dinners. Two brekkers.
Very bad for my figure. yes?. yes?. All right, I'll hold on.
Operator, this is ridiculous.
I've been waiting 17 minutes for a call to Cornwall...
Good.
Oh, all right. Keep your wool on. yes?.
Hello. Is that Smuggler's Rest?.
Mr Baker here.
Must be Miss Caroline's fiance from London.
That'll be Ronald. I'll take it.
Hello, Ronnie.
"Ronnie"?. Now, Caroline, you know how I detest abbreviations.
Now, time is money, you know.
How are your legs?.
Fine.
What?. Well, I still think a nurse was quite unnecessary.
Oh, I see.
I really rang up to give you some good news.
I am coming down to Cornwall for a day or two.
Oh, you are! When are you arriving?.
9.49 this evening.
This evening?.
I just can't wait.
This evening you're dining at the Hall, with the Moustache.
That's why I can't wait.
If you're not back before Ronald arrives, what shall I say?.
- Tell him I'm dining out.
- yes, yes, of course.
Ooh! Look here!
If they should ask you about your accident, don't forget to tell them you fell between parallel bars.
That's right - bars.
I can't think what you are going to do about the food.
- Get rid of it.
- But where, dear, where?.
- In my sponge bag.
- Oh! yes, of course.
- That'll be the Moustache.
- yes, yes, yes.
- Good evening, Colonel.
- Good evening.
She's all ready for you.
Hello.
Well! Well, well, well, well, well. you look very cool and calm.
And waiting to be collected.
Up you come. you smell delicious.
- Bye, Nurse.
- Bye, love. Take this with you.
- Thank you.
- Look after her, Colonel.
The dear naughty thing!
It was sweet of you to fetch me yourself.
We can't have every Tom, Dick and Harry manhandling you, can we?.
Well, not all at the same time.
- I say, Miss Trewella.
- Call me M...
Caroline.
Caroline.
When you say Caroline, your moustache gives a lovely twitch.
Twitch it again.
Caroline.
Nurse Carey says it'll tickle. Will it?.
Goodbye! Have a fine frolic!
Miss Berengaria!
Miss Berengaria!
Are you anywhere about?.
(yawns) Hello, nursey.
Oh, there you are.
I was having a snooze.
What?. Under the water?.
- My gills still work.
- Of course, of course.
I brought my sewing down.
I thought you might be lonely.
- What are you making?.
- I'm embroidering a boudoir cap and a nightie.
- Whoever for?.
- For myself.
- Oh, show me.
- All right. I'll try them on.
I must do it properly.
It took me simply months to embroider this.
I must have the bows.
Is it funny?.
Now, how's that?.
I want it.
Naughty!
No, no. Mustn't touch.
If I had legs, I'd wear pyjamas.
Oh, yes.
Well, I do... on alternate weeks.
May I have some more?.
I'm terribly thirsty.
Delicious.
Do you find that champagne rather dry?.
No, it's lovely and wet, thank you.
Barclay was saying you don't look in the least like a schoolmistress.
Oh?. Why?.
Rather too charming.
Thank you.
What er... subjects do you take?.
- Games.
- Fun and games?.
There's plenty of fun out of school.
It's certainly fun having you so near us.
Barclay simply pines for female company.
He's so easily attracted.
I suppose he must be.
But his enthusiasm... never lasts for long.
How trying for you.
But never mind.
We always say where I come from,
"There are as many good men on dry land as ever fell in the sea. "
Mm. I dare say there's a great deal of truth in that.
- I suppose you swim well.
- Like a fish. Why?.
Barbara's very good in the sea.
I'm not particularly good in the sea.
How very extraordinary.
- Most extraordinary.
- Oh! Will you have some more chicken?.
No, thank you.
I haven't quite got my appetite back yet.
Most unfortunate about your accident.
It has its compensations.
How did it happeng?.
I was going from one bar to another, and I fell down.
I see you're engaged. yes, but I don't mind breaking it off.
Oh, really?. Why?.
I find my fiance rather repulsive.
Brandy, madam?.
Oh, thank you. I'll help myself.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Delicious.
That Miss Trewella.
- What?.
- Drinks like a fish.
Really?.
Half a pint of Napoleon brandy gone in one gulp.
She must have a strong head.
- It's as well she has a full stomach.
- But she hasn't. Look!
# I can't resist...
# Men
# Can't do without them
# Weak ones or strong, right men or wrong
# I don't mind
# Here in my arms, they all have charms
# I'm so fond of men
# Can't resist men
# I love them all, then...
# Easy to date, that's been my fate
# From the age of...
# Ten
# I can't resist...
# Men
Enchanting.
That was quite charming. yes, wasn't it?.
- Where were you trained?.
- The Canary Islands.
I studied singing once.
But I got so lazy about my scales.
Oh, really?. I've never had any trouble with my scales.
Why don't you ask her to sing at your concert next week?.
What concert?.
A charity affair I'm organising over at the theatre in Pennregis.
In the theatre! Oh, I'd love to.
I'm afraid we've got rather a full programme.
Some other time, perhaps.
- Shall I sing to you?.
- No, thank you.
Has Miranda said anything against my voice?.
No, no, no. She said you played a conch shell very nicely.
- I sing much better.
- Do you?.
My high notes are so high that only a dogfish can hear them.
Wouldn't it be a pity to waste them on me?.
Of course, Miranda has never really forgiven me for scaring away a very handsome lifeguard.
Oh?. How did you do that?.
By singing.
It was last year.
There I was sitting on the Needles.
Perhaps that was the trouble, dear.
Ten to one that's Miss Caroline's fiance.
And no-one to answer the door.
Now, be as quiet as a clam.
I'll be right down back here as soon as I've settled him.
Bye-bye.
What a hullabaloo!
Patience! Patience!
Oh. Mr Baker?. yes.
Do come in.
I'm afraid Miss Trewella is out.
But she's expecting me.
Will she be long?.
Well, I really don't know.
She's dining at the Hall.
She can walk again, I see.
No, no, no.
The young gentleman carried her.
I don't care for that at all.
She seemed to enjoy it.
Goodbye, Barbara.
Thank you for a lovely evening.
- your playing was perfect.
- Oh, thank you.
I do so like a musical background.
Excuse me, madam,
I think you left this in the dining room.
Ah! My toothbrush.
I never go anywhere without it.
It's a habit that I picked up from my great-grandfather, Old Matthew Trewella.
He always used to say,
"Where I dines, I sleeps. "
He was a very determined man.
Goodbye, Barbara.
Goodbye.
- Simes?.
- yes, madam?.
- Was that a sponge bag?.
- yes, madam.
- What was in it?.
- Miss Trewella's dinner, madam.
- Her dinner?.!
- yes, madam.
Very tiresome customer.
I'll settle him, all right.
Miss Berengaria! Miss Berengaria!
Oooh!
- Take it off at once!
- Try and get it, you old trout!
My nightie! My nightie! My... you naughty girl!
It's naughty of you, doing that!
I'll catch you!
I'll catch you!
I'll catch you!
# I can't resist men
# Bo-bo-bo-bo
# Can't do without them
# Bo-bo bobo-bo
Barclay, it's been wonderful.
Has it, Carolineg?.
Now, where will you kiss me?.
It doesn't tickle at all.
Caroline, your breath is like ozone.
What's ozone?.
A condensed form of oxygen emitting a pungent odour.
Ah, Barclay!
This is my fiance, Ronald.
- How do you do?.
- Not at all well, thank you.
I didn't know you were in Cornwall.
So it seems.
- Well, I expect you'd like to take over.
- yes.
- Right?.
- Right.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Sweet dreams.
And what do you mean by allowing that man to kiss you?.
He's a very beautiful man, and I liked it.
I don't think there's nearly enough kissing goes on.
Don't you want to kiss me?.
Well, I... I can't kiss you just like that.
Have you got another way?.
What's come over you?. you've never been like this before.
We did waste time, didn't we?. you know, you could be quite attractive.
Let's take your glasses off.
Perhaps not.
But you always seemed so sensible and level-headed, and...
Dull.
I don't want a wife who sparkles.
Just look at that dress.
It's lovely, isn't it?.
It's far too revealing.
I'd be ashamed to wear it.
I doubt if it would suit you.
And all those pearls.
If you go on spending at this rate, you'll be on the rocks in a fortnight.
I know.
Well, she's either a roaring drunk or a raving lunatic.
- She's just full of spirits.
- Overflowing.
She tossed a neat half-pint of brandy into the flowerpot.
I meant high spirits, Barbara.
I've done the same sort of thing myself.
- At the regimental dinner last...
- yes, dear. We know.
Did you put the regimental dinner into a sponge bag?.
- Dinner?.
- Or put doubloons into the church collection?.
Well, I... I can't help feeling sorry for her.
Oh! you haven't met her fiance. I have.
He wears glasses.
He comes from Beckenham.
I'm glad he's turned up.
It'll keep you out of trouble.
Everyone knows she hasn't a penny.
Old Miss Trewella left practically nothing except the house.
- you don't think she's after my money, do you?.
- I don't see what else.
Well, I'm bound to tell you, Barbara, there might be something else.
Oh?. What?.
My moustache.
Now, business.
I came down here to sell the house.
Not to see me.
Might as well be frank about it.
No time for slop.
Quite a nice little place, but give me a modern maisonette any day.
It's been in my family for generations.
The sooner it isn't, the better.
What have you done about selling it?.
Nothing.
Tomorrow morning you and I go to the house agent's together.
Tomorrow morning I am going fishing.
It must be wonderful being a fisherman's wife. you can have too much of a good thing.
I don't believe it.
This is a new line I've got.
Is it?. It's most effective.
Where do you live, Jeff?.
Over at Pennregis.
That's where Barbara Davenport's giving her concert. yes. What we suffer for charity.
I'd love to be in it.
I've got a bite!
It must be enormous!
Doesn't your fiance mind you being out with me?.
He's furious.
- Aren't you in love with him?.
- No, I'm not.
- Then what about...
- He was forced onto me.
Oh, you poor darling.
Jeff, you're so understanding.
Oh! (Giggles)
Only an old gull.
- Excuse me.
- Good morning, sir. Lovely morning.
Where could I find a fisherman named Jeff Saunders?.
Oh, he went out some time ago.
- That's his boat over there, look.
- Oh, yes.
I wonder if I might look through your telescope.
I don't suppose
Mr Saunders would mind.
Oh!
There. It's a very unusual recipe.
I hope it's to your liking.
That's lovely. Thank you.
- What on earth is it?.
- Mussel soup.
Oh. A very little for me.
Good.
But it's cold!
That's the way I like it.
And raw fish. I saw you this morning in the boat, with that man.
We didn't fish for long.
He wanted to kiss me.
- And you let him.
- I had to encourage him slightly.
Whilst you were out,
I put the house in the hands of the agents.
The sooner I get you back to Beckenham, the better.
Nothing would induce me to leave the coast.
And what about my career?. In a hole like this?. your career as what?.
Sanitary Officer, of course.
Sanitary Officer.
So you're one of those people that think it's a good idea to dump all sorts of horrid things into the sea.
What better place is there for refuse?.
I've always wanted to meet one of you. yes. For once, I'm ashamed of you.
It may have been ill-mannered, but it got rid of him.
- But the poor damp boy...
- He'll be dry by the time he gets to London.
- That's all very well, but...
- He should have brought another suit.
We haven't all got two of everything.
Think of my one lovely nightie, floating out there all alone in the bay.
Hello.
Barclay?.
It's me.
Ronald's gone back to London.
I've broken off my engagement.
What?.
Capital. That's really quite something, isn't it.
Very encouraging all round.
Look, er... shall I canter over to see you this afternoon?.
Oh, yes. Then I can ride with you.
I tell you what.
I'll gallop.
Here's the Colonel arriving.
This is where I go and feed my birds.
- Good evening, Colonel.
- Good evening.
- Hello.
- Hello.
I'm awfully sorry.
I'm afraid I got rather carried away last night.
Don't apologise. It was your turn to be carried.
- Has your fiance gone for good?.
- Yes.
And are you staying for good?.
I'm staying, Barclay.
I've er... I've bought you a present.
How sweet of you! What is it?.
Something rather personal.
They say a girl can't have too many.
That's right, Barclay. A girl can't.
I just thought that's what Caroline would like. yes, Barclay. Caroline would.
Ooooh!
Good afternoon, ma'am. you've swum a good way out, ma'am.
- you're not in trouble, I suppose.
- Oh, in trouble! you naughty old man!
I didn't mean anything disrespectful, lady.
I'm no lady.
The currents are very strong around here.
Mind you're not carried out to sea.
Would you like me to sing to you?.
Sing to me?. No, thank you, ma'am.
I've got a voice like a siren.
I reckon you might have, at that.
No, ma'am.
That'd upset the mackerel, that would.
After all, there's a time and place for all things.
What's that you're doing?.
If that's the way you're feeling, you'd better come aboard.
Argh!
I've always wanted to ride a horse.
Can't we go any faster?.
Faster?. you're an invalid, remember.
Hold on!
Barclay.
Darling Barclay.
I shall hate to leave Cornwall.
Must you?.
My lovely house is up for sale already.
Oh, Caroline.
Never mind.
I've got such sweet memories.
Caroline, stay.
How can I?.
As my wife.
Could I keep my house?.
Why, yes, of course.
Lovely.
May I think it over?.
Don't keep me in suspense.
Ask me again, Saturday week.
I feel in stamping good form. Do you?. yes. Stamping.
Good. Now, with any luck, we should reach Cheddar tomorrow, and Glastonbury the next day.
Good.
- Baker here.
- Hello. Ronald?.
If you have rung to apologise, you're wasting your time.
Apologise for what?.
You know perfectly well.
But I don't know what you mean. your deportment whilst I was down in Cornwall.
Down in Cornwallg?.
Making love to strange men right under my nose.
Throwing a tureen of soup over me.
I smell revolting and my suit is ruined.
Well, I must say, it does sound rather awful.
I don't know what I could have been thinking of.
Are you very scalded?. you know perfectly well the concoction was freezing cold.
Oh, it was! Oh, yes, of course it was.
And... I request the return of my diamond.
Immediately.
Certainly. By registered post.
Finished already?. yes, completely.
Has Miss Berengaria always pinched things, dear?.
- yes, and she's getting worse.
- Really?.
Kleptomania caused by depression,
I should say.
- Have you nearly finished that, darling?.
- Nearly.
That'll be Mr Saunders.
There we are.
Put it away, and curl up your tail.
- Good evening, Nurse.
- Good evening, Mr Saunders.
For me?. How charming of you.
Thank you very much.
Go in, will you?. you'll find her all agog.
- Hello.
- Hello.
I've brought you a present.
- Not a pair of shoes.
- Shoes?.
No, a pair of lobsters.
Oh, thank you.
I've come to say
I shan't be going fishing tomorrow morning.
Why not?.
I'm going out with the regular fishing fleet tonight.
They've been having a lean time.
I hoped I might change their luck.
If you cast your nets near the Durdle Rocks...
.. you will change their luck.
But everyone knows that's a rotten fishing ground.
Promise me you'll fish there tonight.
All right. But where do you get your inside information?.
I'm Cornish.
Perhaps I've got second sight.
I wish I didn't feel that
I'd double-crossed those mackerel.
- Terry Rundle.
- Hello, Miss Barbara.
- Why are the bells ringing?.
- Great news.
There's been a record catch down by Durdle Rocks.
Never saw so many fish in my life.
And all thanks to that Miss Trewella.
She showed us where to cast the nets.
A proper fish diviner she's turned out to be!
Oh, really. That's very interesting.
I reckon the Trewellas always had a way with fish.
Old Matthew Trewella had, anyway. you don't really believe such things, do you?.
I don't know, but...
My old father used to tell me of a very strange catch in the cave under Smuggler's Rest.
Oh.
Did he?.
Oh!
Oooh!
Pink pilchards for pale people.
# Oh, Shenandoah
# I love your brother
# Away, you rolling river
# Oh, Shenandoah,
I love your daughter...
Someone stole her clothes while she was swimming.
I wonder who that could have been.
Jeff, do you know where she was swimming?.
Somewhere down here, I think.
What was the time?.
About an hour ago.
She didn't say anything about me, did she?.
No.
Except that she wanted to ask you to sing at her concert.
Oh.
Will you be there?.
Not unless you promise to sing.
Darling Jeff.
I shall hate to leave Cornwall.
Then don't. Stay.
How can I?.
As my wife.
- Could I keep my house?.
- Why not?. We could live here.
How lovely.
Will you ask me again next Saturday?.
I changed my mind about asking Caroline to sing.
- That's very nice of you, Barbara.
- yes.
I think I'm going to enjoy launching her.
- you must admit, she's got something.
- Oh, yes.
Something no-one else has got.
Oh, Caroline?.
Erm, about my concert, over at Pennregis.
I was wondering if perhaps you'd like to sing, after all.
I'd love to, if you really want me to.
I suppose there's no hope of you being on your feet by then?.
None at all.
I thought not. Well, now... your song.
Suppose we have you perched on the pianog?.
We want everybody to see you.
Lovely.
Will the people from the newspapers be there?.
Oh, yes. The press will be there.
I think I can promise you quite a splash.
I must have the most lovely dress. yes, yes, yes.
Extra-long, since you have to sit on the piano.
And Bere must be there to hear me.
Berengaria, at the Pier Theatre?.
Underneath the pier. you can hear very well.
- Can you?.
- yes, there's a soft, seaweedy slab.
- We go there very often.
- yes, yes, of course.
- What are you going to sing?.
- I don't know. Have you got any ideas?.
I always used to fall back on the Mother's Song from The Merry Matador.
I don't know whether it's quite your style.
It's a song with action.
Do it for me.
Goodness me.
I'll have a try.
- I must have a mandolin.
- A mandolin.
Oh, yes, yes.
# I'm Maria, the matador's mother
# Ole!
# Ole!
# Hey-hey!
# There's nobody keener in all the arena
# To keep him out of the dirt
She really has a fish's tail?.
Oh, yes.
It's quite beautiful, rather like a whiting. you're sure somebody isn't playing a trick on you?.
Of course not. I've seen it myself.
Hm. Tail like a whiting, eh?.
I tell you what, I'll come down myself, tomorrow night.
- Good.
- What time?.
About 730. you'll bring a photographer?.
Of course.
What other personalities will be there?.
First of all, I'm getting onto Dr Fergus.
He's a member of the Zoological Society...
The mating cry of the chimpanzee differs from that of the...
Er, no. No, alter that.
.. the love cry of the larger ape. yes?.
Trunk call for you, Doctor.
Hello.
Barbara Davenport! How are you, my dear?.
A discovery?. How interesting.
A what, did you say?.
A what?.!
Are you sure it's not a seal?.
Catch her!
We must catch her at all costs!
On land?.
Masquerading as a woman?. yes, of course I'll come down. Sure.
Beautiful face?. Never mind the face.
What about her piscatorial extremity?. you've got a namesake down in Pendower.
Oh, really?. yes, another Caroline Trewella.
- What's she been doing?.
- Well, she hasn't done it yet.
What do you mean?.
It says.. "Miss Caroline Trewella, Pendower, will make her debut as a singer at the Pennregis Pier Theatre tonight. "
Miss Barbara Davenport, the organiser, says..
"Miss Trewella is to be my surprise item. "
Surprise item?.
- Good luck tonight, Barbara.
- Thank you.
I think we'd better have this down.
That's fine. Thank you very much.
Oh, Signor Mantalini...
Miss Davenport, who is this Caroline Trewella?.
- She comes from Pendower.
- An amateur?.
- A very exceptional one.
- I am exclusive!
I do not share a cage with a Cornish nightingale.
Cantare una canzone...
A great prima donna! Mantalini has been used as bait - a sprat to catch a mackerel! Hm!
There you are, my love.
Ready for the great moment.
Thank you.
One last little finishing touch.
Which flowers will you wear?.
Roses from the Moustache?.
Or Mr Jeff's orchids?.
Mr Jeff...
I'd be tempted, if they didn't clash. you don't think she'll get away?.
Impossible.
There are policemen all around the pier.
And seal trainers are on guard outside her dressing room.
And used to dealing with slippery customers.
Their mobile tank is ready to transport her to London.
Come in.
Hello.
Hello.
- you look beautiful.
- Doesn't she?.
She's going to be a sensation.
Are Marco and Zampa's performing seals in your show?.
- Performing seals?.
- What do you mean?.
They're in a tank at the stage door.
If I'm not mistaken,
Marco and Zampa are in the corridor now.
Nonsense. They're not in my show.
I thought they were, particularly when I saw old Fergus.
- Er, I think...
- Who is old Fergus?.
A professor of the Zoological Society.
Mad about aquatic mammals.
Jeff, you must go out front.
I don't want you to miss this.
- Can't I carry her?.
- No, Barclay will do that.
Good luck.
Thank you.
Good luck, dearest... Caroline.
She knows! She knows what I am.
- I'm in a trap!
- No, never.
- Let me have a look-see.
- Hurry! Hurry!
- We're imprisoned.
- Try the corridor.
What am I going to do?.
They shan't get you! They shan't!
Caroline!

- Good evening.
Hello, Barclay.
How very nice to see you again.
I've come to whisk you off your feet.
Whatever for?.
Nervous?. yes, a little.
I've never been on a public stage before. you'll be all right.
The audience will adore you.
This way, Colonel.
Now, love.
Hope it all works out.
See you one day soon.
Hello, Bonzo! Hello, Trixie.
There you are.
- Bye-bye.
SEAL: Bye-bye!
Hello.
Good luck.
Bere!
- Oh, Miranda!
- I've had a terribly narrow squeak.
Bere, they found me out.
They'll be after you in speedboats!
They won't. Caroline's up there.
She's taken over.
- Can she sing?.
- Not a note.
Signor Mantalini will now play for us the celebrated cello solo entitled La Violette.
The Violin.
Signor Mantalini.
- Infernal machine.
Woo-hoo!
Where are you, love?.
Wonderful, Catch it. you just sing into it like this.
# I'm Maria the matador's mother
They'll think you're singing up here.
All right?. I'll send it down.
Here it comes. Catch it!
Got itg?. Good!
Lovely!
Good luck!
If only Caroline could fall in love with one of the men, we'd keep the house in the family.
I do so hope it could be Jeff. you should worry. you'll be back in our nice semi-detached cave any day now. you're so cold-blooded, Bere.
It's just that I know which side my eels are jellied, that's all.
Think she'll break out our way, Bill?.
Can't say. Never handled one of these mermaid jobs before.
What's that?.
A blinkin' seal. I saw his whiskers.
Good evening, Sergeant.
Are you busy?. (Giggles)
Here, Bill. She's here. In a hat.
- What's that?.
- A mermaid! In a hat.
It was a seal, I told you.
Good evening, Inspector!
Coming for a stroll?.
Go away!
Go away!
She nicked my hel...
Leave me alone, miss! I'm a married man!

(Shrieks) Let go of my tail!
Oooh! (Giggles)
Ladies and gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen, please, I'm so sorry.
I must apologise for this awful upset.
But you have clear proof now of something
I have known for the past three days.
The extraordinary performance that you have witnessed is due to the fact that Miss Trewella is not a woman, but a mermaid!
- Mermaid, show your tail!
A regular red-hot mammal.
Barclay, what happened?.
I don't know.
The whole thing's extremely fishy to me.
I think you and I had better walk home.
What's the matter?.
Nothing. Why?.
For a moment, you seemed to be like you were before your accident.
I'll never be like that again.
Cinderella
You're as lovely as your name
Cinderella
You're a sunset in a frame
Though you're dressed in rags
You wear an air of queenly grace
Anyone can see
A throne would be your proper place
Cinderella
If you give your heart a chance
It will lead you
To the kingdom of romance
There you'll see your dreams unfold
Cinderella
In the sweetest story
Ever told
Once upon a time, in a faraway land, there was a tiny kingdom, peaceful, prosperous, and rich in romance and tradition.
Here, in a stately chateau, there lived a widowed gentleman and his little daughter, Cinderella.
Although he was a kind and devoted father, and gave his beloved child every luxury and comfort, still, he felt she needed a mother's care.
And so, he married again, choosing for his second wife a woman of good family, with two daughters just Cinderella's age, by name, Anastasia and Drizella.
It was upon the untimely death of this good man, however, that the stepmother's true nature was revealed.
Cold, cruel, and bitterly jealous of Cinderella's charm and beauty, she was grimly determined to forward the interests of her own two awkward daughters.
Thus, as time went by, the chateau fell into disrepair.
For the family fortunes were squandered upon the vain and selfish stepsisters, while Cinderella was abused, humiliated, and finally forced to become a servant in her own house.
And yet, through it all,
Cinderella remained ever gentle and kind.
For with each dawn, she found new hope that someday her dreams of happiness would come true.
Well, it serves you right, spoiling people's best dreams.
Yes, I know it's a lovely morning, but it was a lovely dream, too.
What kind of a dream?
Can't tell.
'Cause if you tell a wish, it won't come true.
And, after all...
A dream is a wish
Your heart makes
When you're fast asleep
In dreams you will lose
Your heartaches
Whatever you wish for
You keep
Have faith
In your dreams and someday
Your rainbow will come smiling through
No matter how your heart is grieving
If you keep on believing
The dream that you wish
Will come true
Oh, that clock.
Old killjoy.
I hear you. "Come on, get up," you say.
Time to start another day.
Even he orders me around.
Well, there's one thing.
They can't order me to stop dreaming.
And perhaps someday...
The dreams that I wish
Will come true
No matter how your heart is grieving
If you keep on believing
The dream that you wish
Will come true
- Look what I found.
- Over there, Cinderella.
Wait a minute.
One at a time, please.
Now, Jaq, what's all the fuss about?
New mouse in the house.
Brand-new. Never saw it before.
- Visitor. Visitor!
- Oh, a visitor.
Well, she'll need a dress...
- No, no, no.
- It's not a she, it's a he.
- He, he.
- Oh, that does make a difference.
- He'll need a jacket and shoes...
- Gotta get him out!
- It's in a rat trap.
- Where?
In a trap? Why didn't you say so?
Now, now, calm down, everybody.
Oh, the poor little thing's scared to death.
Jaq, maybe you better explain things to him.
Zuk, zuk, Cinderelly.
Now, now. Look, little guy.
Take it easy. Nothin' to worry about.
We like you. Cinderelly likes you, too.
She's nice, very nice.
That's better. Come on, now. Zuk, zuk.
Zuk, zuk.
Well, that's better.
Well, let's just slip it on for size.
It is a little snug.
But it'll have to do.
Now, for a name.
I've got one. Octavius.
But for short, we'll call you Gus.
Like it, Gus? Like it? Like it?
Gus-Gus.
I've got to hurry.
See he keeps out of trouble, Jaq.
And don't forget to warn him about the cat.
Zuk, zuk. Look, did you ever see a cat?
Cat, cat?
Cat, cat. Lucifer. That's him.
Meany, sneaky.
Jump at you. Bite at you.
Big, big. Big as a house.
Zuk, zuk, Lucify?
Lucify, zuk, zuk.
Here, kitty, kitty.
Come, kitty. Come on.
Lucifer! Come here!
I'm sorry if Your Highness objects to an early breakfast.
It's certainly not my idea to feed you first.
It's orders. Come on.
Lucify. Is that Lucify?
Zuk, Lucify. That's him.
Gus-Gus take the Lucify and look at!
No, Gus-Gus, no.
Now, listen here. Lucify not funny.
Lucify mean.
Bruno.
Bruno!
Dreaming again.
Chasing Lucifer?
Catch him this time? That's bad.
Suppose they heard you upstairs.
You know the orders.
So if you don't want to lose that nice, warm bed, you'd better get rid of those dreams.
Know how?
Just learn to like cats.
No, I mean it.
Lucifer has his good points, too.
For one thing, he...
Well, sometimes he...
There must be something good about him.
Bruno!
Oh, Bruno.
Come on, now. Outside.
I know it isn't easy, but at least we should try to get along together.
And that includes you, Your Majesty.
Breakfast time.
Everybody up. Hurry, hurry.
Come on, everybody, breakfast, breakfast.
Come on, let's eat breakfast.
Breakfast? Breakfast!
Lucify. How're we gonna get out?
Let's see.
Listen, ibby-dibby. Got an idea.
Now, somebody's got to sneak out, get Lucify to chase him, run over to the corner and keep Lucify there.
Then we all run out. Zuk.
Yuk, yuk. Out.
Now we choose the one to do it.
Ibby-dibby hop.
- Hop.
- Hop.
- Ready, hop.
- Hop.
Hop.
- Now...
- Hop, hop, hop.
Hop.
Oh, there you are.
I was wondering.
All right. Breakfast is served.
Take it easy, cluck-cluck.
Let go! Let go, now.
Stop that. Go on, shoo, shoo.
Shoo, shoo, shoo!
Poor little Gus.
Here.
Help yourself.
Where's Gus-Gus?
Well, guess he got away.
Cinderella!
All right, all right. I'm coming.
Oh, my goodness.
Morning, noon, and night.
Cinderella!
Coming, coming.
- Cinderella!
- I'm coming.
- Cinderella!
- In a minute.
Cinderella!
Good morning, Drizella. Sleep well?
As if you care.
Take that ironing and have it back in an hour.
One hour, you hear?
Yes, Drizella.
Good morning, Anastasia.
Well, it's about time.
Don't forget the mending.
Don't be all day getting it done, either.
Yes, Anastasia.
Well, come in, child, come in.
Good morning, Stepmother.
Pick up the laundry and get on with your duties.
Yes, Stepmother.
Oh, Mother. Oh, Mother!
Mother! Mother!
You did it. You did it on purpose.
Mother! Mother! Mother!
Now what did you do?
She put it there.
A big, ugly mouse, under my teacup.
All right, Lucifer.
What did you do with him?
Oh, you're not fooling anybody.
We'll just see about this.
Come on. Let him go.
Now the other one.
Come on!
Oh, poor little Gus.
Oh, Lucifer, won't you ever learn?
Cinderella!
Yes, Stepmother.
Are you gonna get it.
Close the door, Cinderella.
Come here.
- You don't think that I...
- Hold your tongue.
Now, it seems we have time on our hands.
- But I was only trying to...
- Silence!
Time for vicious practical jokes.
Perhaps we can put it to better use.
Now, let me see...
There's the large carpet in the main hall.
Clean it!
And the windows, upstairs and down.
Wash them!
Oh, yes.
And the tapestries and the draperies.
- But I just finished...
- Do them again!
And don't forget the garden.
Scrub the terrace.
Sweep the halls and the stairs.
Clean the chimneys.
And, of course, there's the mending and the sewing and the laundry.
Oh, yes. And one more thing.
See that Lucifer gets his bath.
My son has been avoiding his responsibilities long enough.
It's high time he married and settled down.
Of course, Your Majesty.
But we must be patient.
I am patient!
But I'm not getting any younger, you know.
I want to see my grandchildren before I go.
- I understand, Sire.
- No.
No, you don't know what it means to see your only child grow farther, farther, and farther away from you.
I'm...
I'm lonely in this desolate old palace.
I... I want to hear the pitter-patter of little feet again.
Now, now, Your Majesty.
- Perhaps if we just let him alone...
- Let him alone?
With his silly romantic ideas?
But, Sire, in matters of love...
Love.
Just a boy meeting a girl under the right conditions.
So, we're arranging the conditions.
But, Your Majesty, if the Prince should suspect.
Suspect!
Look, the boy's coming home today, isn't he?
Yes, Sire.
Well, what could be more natural than a ball to celebrate his return?
Nothing, Sire.
If all the eligible maidens in my kingdom just happened to be there, why, he's bound to show interest in one of them, isn't he?
Isn't he?
Yes, Sire.
The moment he does...
Soft lights.
Romantic music.
All the trimmings!
It can't possibly fail.
Can it?
Yes, Sire. No, Sire!
Very well, Sire.
I shall arrange the ball for...
- Tonight.
- Tonight? Tonight!
- Oh, but, Sire...
- Tonight!
And see that every eligible maid is there.
Understand?
Yes, Your Majesty.
The pear-shaped toad
Sing, sweet nightingale
High
Above me
Oh, sing, sweet nightingale
Sing, sweet nightingale
High
Above
Oh, sing, sweet nightingale
Sing, sweet nightingale
High
Oh, sing, sweet nightingale
Sing, sweet
Nightingale
Oh, sing, sweet nightingale
Sing, sweet
Oh, sing, sweet nightingale
Sing
Oh, sing, sweet nightingale
Oh, sing, sweet
Oh
Sing
Lucifer!
You mean old thing.
I'm just going to have to teach you a lesson.
Open in the name of the King.
An urgent message from His Imperial Majesty.
- Thank you.
- From the King!
What's it say, Cinderelly?
What's it say?
I don't know.
He said it's urgent.
Maybe I should interrupt the music lesson.
Sing, sweet nightingale
High
You clumsy! You did it on purpose.
- It's her fault.
- Girls, girls. Remember, above all, self-control.
Yes!
Cinderella!
I've warned you never to interrupt...
- This just arrived from the palace.
- From the palace!
- Give it here.
- Let me have it.
I'll read it.
Well, there's to be a ball.
- A ball!
- In honour of His Highness, the Prince.
Oh, the Prince!
And, by royal command, every eligible maiden is to attend.
- Why, that's us!
- And I'm so eligible.
That means I can go, too.
Her, dancing with the Prince.
I'd be honoured, Your Highness.
Would you mind holding my broom?
Well, why not?
After all, I'm still a member of the family.
And it says, "By royal command",
"every eligible maiden is to attend."
Yes, so it does.
Well, I see no reason why you can't go.
If you get all your work done.
Oh, I will. I promise.
And if you can find something suitable to wear.
I'm sure I can.
Oh, thank you, Stepmother.
Mother, do you realise what you just said?
Of course.
I said "if."
Oh. "If."
Isn't it lovely?
- It was my mother's.
- It's pretty, but it looks old.
Well, maybe it is old-fashioned, but I'll fix that.
- How do you do it?
- Wait a minute.
There ought to be some good ideas in here.
This one.
Oh, very nice. Nice.
- Like it.
- It'll be easy.
I'll have to shorten the sleeves,
I'll need a sash,
- a ruffle, something for a collar...
- Cinderella!
Oh, now what do they want?
Cinderella!
Oh, well.
I guess my dress will just have to wait.
Cinderella!
All right, all right. I'm coming.
Poor Cinderelly.
Every time she finds a minute, that's the time when they begin it.
Cinderelly, Cinderelly.
Cinderella!
Cinderelly, Cinderelly
Night and day it's Cinderelly
Make the fire
Fix the breakfast
Wash the dishes
Do the moppin'
And the sweepin' and the dustin'
They always keep her hoppin'
She'd go around in circles
Till she's very, very dizzy
- Still they holler
- Keep her busy, Cinderelly
Yeah. Keep her busy.
You know what?
- Cinderelly won't go to the ball.
- What?
- Not go?
- What did you say?
You'll see. They'll fix her.
Work, work, work.
She'll never get her dress done.
Poor Cinderelly.
Hey! We can do it!
We can do it
We can do it
We can help our Cinderelly
We can make the dress so pretty
There's nothing to it, really
We'll tie a sash around it
Put a ribbon through it
When dancing at the ball she'll be more beautiful than all
In the lovely dress we make for Cinderelly
Hurry, hurry, hurry
Gonna help our Cinderelly
Got no time to dilly-dally
We got to get it goin'
I'll cut it with the scissors.
And I can do the sewing.
Leave the sewing to the women.
You go get some trimmin'.
And we'll make a lovely dress for Cinderelly, whoo
We'll make a lovely dress for Cinderelly
Follow me, Gus-Gus.
I know where to go.
It's gonna be pretty, this dress.
Cinderelly will be surprised.
Surprised, surprised. Very surprised.
And this, too, my slippers.
Don't forget...
- Take my dress.
- Here, mend the buttonholes.
- Press my skirt and mind the ruffle.
- Cinderella?
- Yes?
- When you're through, and before you begin your regular chores,
I have a few little things.
Very well.
I don't see why everyone else has nice things to wear, and I always end up in these old rags.
This sash! I wouldn't be seen dead in it.
You should talk. These beads!
I am sick of looking at them.
- Trash.
- Oh, I hate this.
Come on and be careful.
Yes, yes, yes. Real careful.
We can use that, Gus-Gus.
Pretty, pretty.
Look out. Lucify!
Beads!
Very pretty beads!
A dream is a wish your heart makes
When you're fast asleep
In dreams you will lose your heartaches
Whatever you wish for
You keep
No matter how your heart is grieving
If you keep on believing
The dream that you wish will come true
Okay. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
Whatever you wish for you keep
All right.
Heave, ho. Heave, ho.
Heave, ho.
The dream that you wish will come true
Will come true
- Yes?
- The carriage is here.
Why, Cinderella,
- you're not ready, child.
- I'm not going.
Not going? Oh, what a shame.
But, of course, there will be other times.
Yes. Good night.
Oh, well.
What's a royal ball?
After all, I suppose it would be frightfully dull, and boring, and completely...
Completely wonderful.
- It's my...
- Surprise!
- Surprise!
- Surprise!
- Happy birthday!
- No, no, no, no!
Well, I never dreamed it.
It's such a surprise.
Oh, how can I ever...
Oh, thank you so much.
Remember, when you're presented to His Highness,
- be sure...
- Wait!
Please, wait for me.
Isn't it lovely? Do you like it?
Do you think it will do?
- Cinderella!
- Mother, she can't.
- Oh, no.
- You can't!
Girls, please.
After all, we did make a bargain.
Didn't we, Cinderella?
And I never go back on my word.
How very clever.
These beads, they give it just the right touch.
Don't you think so, Drizella?
No, I don't. I think she's...
Why, you little thief!
They're my beads. Give them here.
Oh, no.
And look, that's my sash.
She's wearing my sash.
- Mine!
- Oh, please.
Please, no.
Thief!
Girls, girls.
That's quite enough.
Hurry along now, both of you.
I won't have you upsetting yourselves.
Good night.
You will lose your heartache
Whatever you wish for
You'll keep
Oh, no. No, it isn't true.
Have faith in your dreams and someday
It's just no use.
Your rainbow will come smiling through
No use at all.
No matter how your heart is grieving
If you keep on believing
I can't believe. Not any more.
The dream that you wish
Will come true
There's nothing left to believe in.
Nothing.
Nothing, my dear?
- Oh, now you don't really mean that.
- Oh, but I do.
Nonsense, child!
If you'd lost all your faith,
I couldn't be here.
And here I am.
Oh, come now. Dry those tears.
You can't go to the ball looking like that.
The ball?
- Oh, but I'm not...
- Of course, you are.
But we have to hurry, because even miracles take a little time.
- Miracles?
- Watch.
What in the world did I do with that magic wand? I was sure...
Magic wand?
That's strange.
- I always...
- Then you must be...
Your fairy godmother? Of course.
Where is that wand? I...
Oh! I forgot.
I put it away.
Look at what she did.
How'd she do it?
Now, let's see.
I'd say the first thing you need is
- a pumpkin.
- A pumpkin?
Now the magic words.
Sala-gadoola-menchika-boo-la
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo
Put 'em together and what have you got?
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo
Sala-gadoola-menchika-boo-la
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo
It'll do magic
Believe it or not
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo
Now sala-gadoola means
Menchika-boolaroo
But the thing-a-ma-bob that does the job
Is bibbidi-bobbidi-boo
Sala-gadoola-menchika-boo-la
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo
Put 'em together and what have you got?
Bibbidi-bobbidi
Bibbidi-bobbidi Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo
Oh, looky.
Isn't it wonderful?
Oh, it's beautiful.
Yes, isn't it?
With an elegant coach like that, of course, we'll simply have to have
- mice!
- Mice?
Oh, this really is nice.
Why, we'll have a coach and four when we're through.
Just a wave of my stick and to finish the trick, bibbidi, bobbidi, boo.
Gracious, what did I do?
I was sure there were four.
There should be one more.
There you are.
Bibbidi, bobbidi, boo.
Oh, poor Lucifer.
Serves him right, I'd say. Now...
Where were we? Oh, goodness, yes.
You can't go to the ball without a horse.
Another one?
But tonight, for a change, you will handle the reins, and sit in the driver's seat, too.
For instead of a horse, you're the coachman, of course.
Bibbidi, bobbidi, boo.
That does it, I guess, except for...
Oh, yes!
The finishing touch. And, that's you.
Yes, Bruno, that's right, you'll be footman tonight.
Bibbidi, bobbidi, boo.
Well, well, hop in, my dear.
We can't waste time.
- But...
- No, don't try to thank me.
Oh, I wasn't... I mean, I do, but...
But, don't you think my dress...
Yes, it's lovely, dear.
Good heavens, child.
You can't go in that!
Now, let's see, dear.
Your size and the shade of your eyes.
Something simple, but daring, too.
Oh, just leave it to me.
What a gown this will be.
Bibbidi-bobbidi.
Bibbidi-bobbidi.
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.
Oh, it's a beautiful dress.
Did you ever see such a beautiful dress?
And, look, glass slippers.
Why, it's like a dream.
A wonderful dream come true.
Yes, my child.
But, like all dreams, well, I'm afraid this can't last forever.
You'll have only till midnight, and then...
Midnight? Thank you.
Now, now, now, just a minute.
You must understand, my dear, on the stroke of 12:00 the spell will be broken, and everything will be as it was before.
Oh, I understand, but it's more than I ever hoped for.
Bless you, my child.
I... Goodness me!
It's getting late.
Hurry up, dear. The ball can't wait.
Have a good time.
Dance, be gay.
Now, off you go.
You're on your way.
With a bibbidi-bobbidi
Bibbidi-bobbidi
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo
Princess Frederica
Eugenie de la Fontain.
Mademoiselle Augustina DuBois.
Daughter of General Pierre DuBois.
The boy isn't cooperating.
Mademoiselle Leonora
Mercedes de la Tour.
Daughter of Colonel and Madame de la Tour.
I can't understand it.
There must be at least one who'd make a suitable mother.
Sire.
A suitable wife.
Mademoiselles
Drizella and Anastasia Tremaine.
Daughters of Lady Tremaine.
I give up.
Even I couldn't expect the boy to...
Well, if I may say so,
Your Majesty, I did try to warn you, but you, Sire, are incurably romantic.
No doubt you saw the whole pretty picture in detail.
The young Prince bowing to the assembly.
Suddenly he stops. He looks up.
For, lo, there she stands.
The girl of his dreams.
Who she is or whence she came, he knows not, nor does he care, for his heart tells him that here, here is the maid predestined to be his bride.
A pretty plot for fairy tales, Sire.
But in real life, oh, no.
No! It was foredoomed to failure.
Failure, eh?
Take a look at that, you pompous windbag.
Who is she?
- You know her?
- No, Sire.
I've never seen her before.
That's one thing in her favour.
The waltz. Quick, the waltz!
Lights. The lights.
Failure, eh?
Well... Now for a good night's sleep.
Oh, quite so, Sire. I believe I, too...
You will stay right here.
See they're not disturbed, and when the boy proposes, notify me immediately.
Notify me immediately.
And remember, if anything goes wrong...
- Who is she, Mother?
- Do we know her?
Well, the Prince certainly seems to.
I know I've never seen her.
Nor I.
But she certainly is... Wait.
There is something familiar about her.
Ahem.
So this is love
So this is what makes life
Divine
I'm all aglow
- And now I know
- And now I know
The key to all Heaven
Is mine
My heart has wings
And I can fly
I'll touch every star
In the sky
So this is the miracle
That I've been dreaming of
So this
Is
Love
Oh. Oh, my goodness.
What's the matter?
It's midnight.
Yes, so it is. But why...
- Goodbye.
- No, no, wait.
- You can't go now. It's only...
- Oh, I must. Please.
- Please, I must.
- But why?
Well, I... Oh, the Prince,
I haven't met the Prince.
The Prince?
But didn't you know...
- Goodbye.
- No, wait.
Come back. Please come back.
I don't even know your name.
How will I find you?
Wait! Please wait.
Goodbye.
Oh, I say. Young lady.
- Wait!
- The Prince!
Just a moment.
Guard! Guard!
Stop that coach! Close those gates!
Follow that coach!
Open those gates!
I'm sorry.
I guess I forgot about everything.
Even the time, but...
But it was so wonderful.
And he was so handsome, and when we danced...
Oh, I'm sure even the Prince himself couldn't have been more...
More...
- Oh, well, it's over and...
- Cinderelly.
Look, look! The slippers!
Yeah, your slipper.
Your slipper, Cinderelly.
Thank you.
Thank you so much, for everything.
Your Majesty,
I see no point in beating about the bush.
I regret to inform you, Sire, that the young lady has disappeared, leaving behind only this glass slipper.
Yes. I'll do it.
No. I just can't.
Well, come in.
Come in!
- Your Majesty...
- So, he's proposed already?
- Tell me about it.
- Well...
- Who is she?
- I didn't get a chance...
No matter. We've more important things to discuss.
Arrangements for the wedding, invitations, a national holiday.
- All that sort of thing.
- But, Sire...
Here. Have a cigar. Take a few more.
But...
Better practise passing these out, eh?
But, if you'd only listen.
And for you, my friend.
- Your Majesty, please...
- A knighthood.
I hereby dub you Sir...
By the way, what title would you like?
- Sire? She got away.
- Sir "She Got Away"?
A peculiar title, but if that's what you...
She what? Why, you...
You... You traitor!
Now, Sire.
Remember, your blood pressure.
Treason!
No, Sire. No!
Sabotage!
You were in league with the Prince.
I tried to stop her, but she vanished into thin air.
A likely story.
But it's true, Sire.
All we could find was this glass slipper.
The whole thing was a plot!
But, Sire, he loves her.
He won't rest till he finds her.
He's determined to marry her.
What? What did you say?
The Prince, Sire, swears he'll marry none but the girl who fits this slipper.
He said that, did he?
We've got him!
But, Sire, this slipper may fit one of any number of girls.
That's his problem. He's given his word.
- We'll hold him to it.
- No, Your Highness.
I'll have nothing to do with it.
You'll try this on every maid in my kingdom.
And if the shoe fits, bring her in.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Cinderella? Cinderella?
- Cinderella! Where is that...
- Yes?
Here I am.
My daughters, where are they?
I think they're still in bed.
Don't just stand there!
Bring up the breakfast trays at once.
And hurry!
I wonder what's the matter.
What's the matter with her?
I don't know. Let's find out. Come on.
Drizella. Drizella!
What?
Get up. Quick. This instant.
We haven't a moment to lose.
Anastasia.
Get up, Anastasia.
What for? Why?
Everyone's talking about it, the whole kingdom.
- Hurry now. He'll be here any minute.
- Who will?
The Grand Duke.
He's been hunting all night.
- Hunting?
- For that girl.
The one who lost her slipper at the ball last night.
They say he's madly in love with her.
- The Duke is?
- No, no, no. The Prince!
The Prince!
You clumsy little fool.
Clean that up, then help my daughters dress.
What for?
If he's in love with that girl, why should we even bother?
Now, you two, listen to me.
There is still a chance that one of you can get it.
One of us?
Why, Mother, what do you mean?
Just this:
No one, not even the Prince, knows who that girl is.
We know! We know! Cinderelly!
The glass slipper is their only clue.
The Duke has been ordered to try it on every girl in the kingdom.
And if one can be found whom the slipper fits, then, by the King's command, that girl shall be the Prince's bride.
- His bride.
- His bride!
Cinderella, get my things together.
Never mind her. Get mine right away.
What's the matter with her?
- Wake up, stupid.
- We've gotta get dressed.
Dressed. Oh, yes.
Oh, we must get dressed.
It wouldn't do for the Duke to see me...
Mother, did you see what she did?
- Are you just going to let her...
- Quiet!
So this is love
What's she gonna do?
I don't know. Gotta watch.
Come on.
- Cinderelly!
- Cinderelly!
So this is the miracle
That I've been dreaming of
What?
Oh, no!
No, please!
Oh, you can't, you just can't.
Let me out! You must let me out!
You can't keep me in here!
Oh, please.
No, no. She can't do it.
She can't lock up Cinderelly.
I'm gonna...
Please. Please.
We gotta get that key, Gus-Gus.
We just gotta get that key.
He's over here, the Duke-Duke.
- Yeah, yeah. Who?
- The Grand Duke, with the slipper.
We gotta get that key quick.
Yup, yup. Key, key. Quick.
Oh, Mother, Mother, he's here, he's here.
- The Grand Duke.
- Do I look all right?
- I'm so excited, I don't know what I'll do.
- Girls.
Now, remember, this is your last chance. Don't fail me.
Announcing
His Imperial Grace, the Grand Duke.
You honour our humble home.
Quite so.
May I present my daughters,
Drizella, Anastasia.
Your Grace.
Yes. Charmed, I'm sure.
His Grace will read the royal proclamation.
"All loyal subjects of His Imperial Majesty"
"are hereby notified by royal proclamation in regard to a certain"
"glass slipper."
"It is decreed..."
Why, that's my slipper!
Well, I like that. It's my slipper!
No, no, no! It's Cinderelly's slipper!
- How can she stand there...
- Girls.
Your manners.
A thousand pardons, Your Grace.
Please continue.
Yes, quite so.
Oh, yes.
"It is upon this day decreed"
"that a quest be instituted throughout..."
"The sole and express purpose of such quest to be as follows:"
"That every maid throughout the kingdom without exception,"
"shall try on her foot this slipper of glass,"
"and should one be found upon whose foot this slipper shall properly fit,"
"such maiden shall be acclaimed the object of this search"
"and shall be looked upon as the true love of His Royal Highness,"
"our beloved son and heir, the noble Prince."
"Said Prince will, upon bended knee"
"beg, request, or if need be, implore"
"said maiden that he be granted her hand in marriage."
"Whereupon, should the aforementioned maiden"
"look with favour, shall the couple pledge their troth..."
"And in due course, upon the inevitable demise of His Majesty the King,"
"succeed to the throne to rule over the land"
"as King and Queen of our kingdom."
"So be it."
You must be quite fatigued, Your Grace.
May we offer you some tea?
What? Tea?
Thank you, madam, no.
We must proceed with the fitting.
Of course. Anastasia, dear.
There. I knew it was my slipper.
Exactly my size.
I always wear the same size.
As soon as I saw it, I said...
Oh, well...
It may be a trifle snug today.
You know how it is, dancing all night.
I can't understand why.
It's always fit perfectly before.
I don't think you're half trying.
Mother, can you...
Quiet, my dear.
We mustn't disturb His Grace.
Young man, are you sure you're trying it on the right foot?
Oh, it's the right foot, but...
These glass shoes aren't always reliable.
Come on, hurry.
Up the stairs, up the stairs!
Lucify, Lucify.
Up, up, up with it.
Here.
Why can't you hold still a minute?
My word. Enough of this!
The next young lady, please.
Did you hear that, Gus?
- Yup.
- Gotta hurry.
Come on, come on, hurry.
Gus-Gus, Gus-Gus, come on.
Look, look. Just up there. Come on.
Us is coming, Cinderelly.
- I can get you out.
- You've got the key!
How did you ever manage to...
Lucifer!
Let him go, Lucifer.
Please, let him go.
- Let him go.
- Let him go!
Let him go. Let him out, you hear?
Lucify, you...
Bruno. Yes, Bruno!
Quick, get Bruno. Get Bruno!
Of all the stupid little idiots.
I'll do it myself.
Get away from me.
I'll make it fit.
- There.
- It fits.
It fits?
No!
Oh, Your Grace, I'm dreadfully sorry.
It shan't happen again.
Precisely, madam.
Come on, come on.
Get up, Gus-Gus, get up.
Don't, don't, don't, don't.
Let go, let go.
You are the only ladies in the household I hope... I presume.
- There's no one else, Your Grace.
- Quite so.
- Good day. Good day.
- Your Grace?
Your Grace, please, wait.
May I try it on?
- Pay no attention.
- It's Cinderella.
- From the kitchen.
- Ridiculous.
She's out of her mind.
Just an imaginative child.
Madam, my orders were "every maiden."
Come, my child.
Oh, no.
No, no, no. Oh, no!
Oh, this is terrible.
The King, what will he say?
What will he do?
Perhaps, if it would help...
No, no. Nothing can help now. Nothing.
But, you see, I have the other slipper.
Have faith in dreams
And someday
Your rainbow will come smiling through
No matter how your heart is grieving
If you keep on believing
The dream that you wish
Will come true
Your goal, gentlemen, Antarctica.
Five million square miles of terra incognita,
But your job, to make it just a little less incognita,
Amundsen discovered the South Pole in 1911.
Wilkins explored the coast in 1928.
And Admiral Byrd flew over the South Pole in 1929 and once again in 1947.
Now, gentlemen, it's your turn.
As officers of this great enterprise, you will facilitate our navy's geographical and meteorological mapping operations.
You will also investigate the phenomenon encountered by the Byrd expedition of 1947, a polar oasis consisting of a body of warm water completely surrounded by this vast desert of ice.
Now, at the time, this discovery astounded the entire scientific world, caused a great deal of speculation.
Now, there are other phenomena that you will investigate.
Ellsworth discovered fossil remains of ferns and petrified logs.
Amundsen discovered veins of coal
100 miles long.
There have been reports of iron, copper and nickel.
Now, there may be deposits of uranium under these vast polar ice fields.
Now, in addition, you may find that...
Gentlemen, this way is south.
Thank you.
Now in just a few moments, we'll show you excerpts from a film made by the Byrd expedition which'll give you firsthand information on many of the problems which you are apt to encounter.
But first, we'll take a short break.
Not bad.
She's got a head on her shoulders, too.
Oh, you know her?
Margaret Hathaway, Oceanic Press.
How do you do, Miss Hathaway?
Hello, Captain. I'm sorry I'm late.
That's quite all right.
I was thinking perhaps the OP had decided not to send you after all.
Oh, no.
Of course you're aware of the dangers of this trip?
I am. I've read a great deal about Antarctica.
I wasn't thinking of Antarctica exactly.
I was thinking more of your being alone with 800 men.
I've read a great deal about men, too.
Don't forget, once I was alone with half a million of them for three months in Korea.
In that case, Miss Hathaway,
I think you've had excellent basic training.
Now, would you care to meet some of the men you'll be working with?
I always love to meet men, Captain.
Miss Margaret Hathaway, may I present Commander Roberts, with whom you'll be spending most of your time?
I've heard about you, Commander.
How do you do?
I can do better than that.
I'm an ardent reader of your column.
How do you do?
This is Lieutenant Jack Carmen.
He'll be your helicopter pilot.
Hello, Lieutenant.
Hi.
I hope you won't mind having to fly the first woman over Antarctica.
Ma'am, you just say the word, and I'll fly you up to the moon.
In a helicopter?
You won't have to worry about him,
Miss Hathaway.
I'm sure he'll cool off as soon as he hits sub-zero weather.
Pardon me.
The film's ready, sir.
Thank you.
You'll excuse me.
Will you join us?
Thank you.
So you're a geophysicist, Commander?
That's right.
But you don't look like a scientist to me.
You don't look like Walter Winchell.
Give me time.
CAPTAlN: Will you take your seats, please?
In 1947, the use of Huskies as draft animals was still very much a part of any operation in the Antarctic.
And here we see some scenes of the careful training that both men and dogs underwent in the months prior to embarkation.
Finally, the ships are loaded,
Admiral Byrd boards his flagship, and the expedition is on its way.
Its main goal is the Bay of Whales in the Ross Sea.
But 800 miles of the Ross lce Barrier had to be penetrated.
But finally, in the winter of '47, which is just the beginning of summer in the Antarctic, the expedition arrives.
It finds the first Little America intact.
And its foodstuffs, bread and other perishables remain unharmed in nature's great deep freeze.
Now, at the edge of the Ross lce Barrier some 800 miles away from Admiral Byrd's base camp, huge transport aircraft for the first time are launched from an aircraft carrier and land in Little America.
Now, their mission, the greatest aerial exploration and mapping program of Antarctica ever undertaken.
Now, here you see the first pictures ever made of Antarctica's ice-free warm water region, first discovered by the Byrd expedition in '47 and which will be thoroughly investigated by a member of our own group...
How soon do we leave?
...Commander Alan Roberts.
In two months.
December 15th, we leave from Norfolk.
CAPTAlN: He will lead an expedition into this region.
It's overwhelming.
This tremendous force chewing up the ice.
Diesel oil.
What?
I was saying, this overwhelming force is caused by the sudden expansion of compressed oil vapor.
Oh, Alan!
Oil vapors, molecules.
Do you have to be so technical?
A few things I can be quite romantic about.
Name one.
Well, women.
Oh.
For example, although I know basically women consist mostly of water, with a few pinches of salt, metals thrown in, you have a very unsaltlike and nonmetallic effect on me.
I give in.
Let's talk about diesel engines, shall we?
Sorry for the rough treatment.
We'll have to put up with it for a while.
We've just entered the Ross lce Pack.
Thanks.
The heaviest since Sir James Clark forced his way through it in 1841.
It's going to hold us back more than we anticipated.
We've got about 700 miles of the stuff to plow through.
It'll put us about two weeks behind schedule.
And how will that affect my program,
Captain Burnham?
Well, we've got four weeks of precious daylight.
I'll have to ask you to take longer flights than I would permit under ordinary circumstances.
You'll commence operations as soon as we reach open water, which will be just about there.
The weather reports are satisfactory.
The sooner you get going, the better.
Are you ready, Lieutenant?
I think so, sir.
Steve?
Ship's all checked out, sir.
Engine's heated.
Provisions? Survival kits?
Yes, sir.
Fine. How about you, Commander?
All my gear's aboard, sir.
Good.
Miss Hathaway, you understand that if anything should happen out there, your chances for survival are limited?
I'm going.
All right, then. Good luck.
Thank you.
Happy landings.
Thank you, sir.
Look at those two.
Man and wife?
Nope. Both males.
Wanna say hello to them?
Maybe you can get an interview.
Looks like they're all wearing tuxedos.
Nope. All female.
40 below zero.
It's hard to believe that millions of years ago this region was subtropical.
In those days, on an excursion like this, you would have worn a bathing suit.
Born too late, I always say.
Unless Mount Erebus erupts again.
If she did, there'd be a lot of melted snow down there.
The latest weather report, sir.
Contact Lieutenant Carmen.
The helicopter is to return at once.
Yes, sir.
A sudden shift in the wind.
There's a storm moving in between here and the warm water region.
I hope we can catch them before they land.
We're getting closer.
Right beyond this range.
There it is!
Well, now I believe it, but there's still the big question.
Is it the beginning of a new heat wave or the tail-end of a million-year-old cooling-off process?
Just how warm is this water?
Warm enough to swim in. 68 degrees.
Base to Helicopter X-3, Over,
Helicopter X-3 to base. Over.
Base to Helicopter X-3. There's a storm front developing south of bay.
Wind velocity 45, direction south-south east.
Return at once,
Try to skirt it in westerly direction,
Do not fly through it! Over,
Received your message.
Am returning to base. Out.
Bad weather building up.
We've got to get back to the base.
There she is.
How high can we go?
Not high enough.
Lieutenant, I've gotta get home.
I've got a kid that's gonna be born in June.
What's your hurry?
It's only the beginning of February.
Are you going to fly around it?
And then refill at the nearest gas station to get home? No, can't do.
Couldn't we just land here?
Look down.
Even if we could, it would be a nice three-week stroll back to base.
Why don't we go back to the warm water lakes and just sit it out?
Ever hear of the point of no return?
It's back there.
Now, what we need is to find a break in this weather.
Over there.
That's what I've been looking for.
It's taking a chance, but there's no other way.
Okay, hold on to your parkas.
I hope to get out of this before we're iced up.
What's your altitude?
Three thousand.
Our collective control is damaged.
The only way I can go is down!
Helicopter X-3 to base.
Helicopter X-3 to base.
The aerial's gone!
Hang on!
We should break through any second.
I don't get it.
We dropped below sea level.
Lieutenant, look at the temperature.
What is it?
We've just gone through a temperature rise of about 50 degrees in less than two minutes.
It's still going up.
What's your altitude?
Twelve hundred feet below sea level.
We could be inside the crater of a volcano.
I hope it's got a bottom.
What's the temperature now?
91 degrees.
It's so hard to breathe.
It's the humidity. Must be close to 100%.
We're now 2,500 feet below sea level!
And the temperature's still going up.
We're breaking through!
Look out!
Hang on! We're gonna hit!
Now, can you see where we got hit?
I can't see anything from here.
I'll take a look up top.
Do you know what's wrong?
No. Not yet.
Steve, while you're up there, see what the antenna damage is.
Lieutenant, I'm gonna need some tools up here.
It's the push-pull tube assembly.
How bad?
Well, I won't be able to tell you till I take it apart.
But it looks as though all it is is a bent tube.
Tools coming right up, Steve.
Oh, Commander, you better take a quick look around.
We're not gonna be here very long.
That's all right with me, Jack.
Why?
Where's that inquiring reporter's mind of yours?
Come on, let's take a look around.
Here we are practically at the South Pole.
A few minutes ago it was 60 below zero.
Wait here.
Alan! Alan!
Maggie, over here.
Where are you?
Right here.
See this?
It's volcanic activity, all right.
Somewhere beneath us, hot gases under tremendous pressure have found a channel to approach the surface.
We'd better get back to the ship.
This is Helicopter X-3 calling base.
We are down.
Helicopter X-3 is down.
Our location, between grid 30 and 32.
We're invisible from the air.
Can you home in on my signal?
Do you read me? Over.
You got the radio fixed?
I'm not so sure.
I haven't been able to pick up a thing.
What about your transmitter? Do you think you're getting through to them?
If I was, they'd answer me.
There's nothing wrong with my receiver.
It could be atmospheric conditions.
Yeah. I'll try again a little later on.
Lieutenant.
It's the push-pull rod, isn't it?
Yes, sir.
All we have to do is straighten it.
Lieutenant, I just realized, this tube is a magnesium alloy.
What are we gonna do now?
Well, in the first place, within the next few hours there won't be a square mile of this area that won't be covered by search planes.
What good'll that do?
They won't be able to see us.
They can pick up our radio signal and home in on it.
They can get us out of here in a few hours.
Right, Lieutenant?
Right.
Steve, help me get out the survival kit.
We might as well make ourselves comfortable.
Commander, you're an excellent naval officer and a brilliant scientist, but you're a very poor liar.
Commander, would you give me a hand here?
Excuse me.
Well, we won't starve for a while, anyway.
Enough rations in here to feed a small army for a couple of months.
If we're not found within 30 days, we'll have to do better than that.
The expedition pulls out at the end of February, and there may not be another one for years.
Can I be of any help?
Yes. You can carry this water jug.
It may have to last us for some time, so be careful.
Well, come on.
Hello, hello!
This is Helicopter X-3 calling base.
Mayday! Mayday!
This is Helicopter X-3 calling base.
We're down and lost.
Please come in. Please come in.
This is Helicopter X-3 calling base.
Mayday! Mayday!
This is Helicopter X-3 calling base!
Mayday! Mayday!
Well, what about that scream?
Didn't you hear it?
I heard it.
I heard something.
Rising volcanic heat melts the ice on top of those cliffs and turns it into the clouds that hang over this valley.
It keeps the heat and the moisture sealed in permanently.
Climatic change, one of the main causes of evolution, doesn't exist here.
See that tree?
It's a species that disappeared from the Earth millions of years ago.
What are you trying to tell us, Commander?
We're liable to meet some ape men around here?
Even the apes are millions of years in the future.
It's my guess that this valley is still in the Mesozoic era.
Do you think there's any kind of animal life down here?
Yes, I'm pretty sure that there is.
Tastes like rotten eggs.
Listen!
Hello, navy rescue.
Helicopter X-3 down. Helicopter X-3 is down.
Calling mayday! Calling mayday!
Get a fix on us please.
We can hear your engines.
You're very close to us.
I'll keep talking as long as I can.
You won't be able to bring a plane in here.
It'll take a copter.
We're at the bottom of a deep canyon, about 3,000 feet below sea level.
There's a heavy cloud layer, some 1,500 feet that you'll have to break through.
We have a broken push-pull tube assembly.
If you drop us a replacement, we can fly out.
We have enough gas to return to base.
Our physical condition is good.
We have enough food for six weeks.
Hello, navy rescue. This is Helicopter X-3.
My battery is running low.
Am forced to discontinue.
Will try to contact you when you return to this sector. Out.
They're right over us!
Why can't they hear us?
I don't think our signal is strong enough.
Can't understand it.
We had enough power last night.
What're you gonna do, Miller? Wait!
A flare's only good for 400 feet.
Why don't we save them until they can see it?
Whoops.
Sorry, Maggie.
I just felt so darned messy.
I had to clean up a bit.
Where's Steve?
Out looking for some fresh water.
I told him to stay close to camp.
Give me a hand with this, will you?
Maggie, will you please bring the oars?
What's the matter?
There's... There's something back there. Awful.
There.
First of the flying lizards.
What a smell.
We better get back to camp.
It isn't safe here.
What's on your mind?
A dead animal is food.
I don't want to be here to meet its consumers.
Come on.
Steve, you go fire up the engines!
Maggie, go with him.
Come on!
Come on!
More throttle!
That sound! What is it, Alan?
Whatever it was, rex wanted no part of it.
You mean there's something that thing's scared of?
The tyrannosaurus that attacked us is the largest, most ferocious dinosaur of this era.
It's not only its size, but the structure...
Alan, no lectures now, please.
Obviously, the only place we've got a chance is right here in this helicopter.
In that case, we better keep our food supplies in here, too.
Right.
Come on, Steve. Let's get them.
We'd better all help.
I don't suppose there's any point in asking which one of us did this.
Come on, Alan, you're the scientist.
What did it?
What could be worse than that thing that attacked us?
Just people, Maggie. Just plain folks.
There weren't any humans in this age.
Fog's beginning to roll in again.
I don't think we'll ever find a way up those cliffs.
Well, whatever it is, at least it's keeping rex away.
Twenty-five more days and after that we'll be the only humans in Antarctica.
That calendar of yours could be wrong.
Besides, they wouldn't think of leaving without us.
Maggie, we gotta face it, they can't risk 1,000 men just for the four of us.
And once winter sets in, the ice pack would crush their ships like matchboxes.
We've still got 25 days.
That's just about how long my clothes are going to last.
You know, I got a name for this valley.
Hell's Chimney.
Fog really socks in, doesn't it?
Oh, Steve, isn't he darling! What is it?
I don't know. I picked him off a tree.
Was sure good to find something small and soft, something that wasn't ready to kill you.
Well, how do you do?
Know him?
Sort of a nodding acquaintance.
I think he's a tarsier, or a very close relative.
He's a mammal, but it's his eyes that tell the story.
Observe, please, they're on the front of his head and not on the side like reptile or fish eyes.
Yes. This little fella already has stereoscopic vision.
MAGGlE:
He certainly looks silly.
Not a very nice way to talk about one of your ancestors.
One of my ancestors?
Mmm-hmm.
Homo sapiens junior. Very, very junior.
At this moment, he can't make up his mind whether or not he should become a real monkey.
But you will.
In 50 million years, you'll be a monkey in a tree.
And then one day, you'll come down and walk on your hind legs.
Another 50 million years flip by just "pfft," and you'll be Aristotle,
Galileo, Michelangelo, Mozart, Shakespeare.
What are we gonna be, monkeys?
I'm gonna get Shakespeare a drink.
Maggie!
Alan!
Maggie, where are you?
Maggie!
Any luck?
No, not a trace.
Commander, here's something.
It's part of her outfit.
I don't understand it.
No animal tracks here. No sign of a struggle.
Here's your answer, Alan.
Look at this!
These footprints were made by a being physically very much like us.
That's all I can tell you.
Except whatever it is, it's got Maggie.
How do you know?
Where's the footprints?
She was being carried.
End of the line.
He used a boat.
He's on this river somewhere.
There!
That smoke's coming from a cave!
Here. Drink.
You're one of us. Who are you?
How did I get here?
I brought you here.
Where are the others?
Where are the others?
That's our food, isn't it?
It's mine.
The whole valley's mine.
Everything in it belongs to me, including you.
What happened to the others?
They're dead.
You killed them.
One of the beasts did it for me.
How long have you been in this valley?
Ten years.
A hundred years.
Time has no meaning when you have nothing to wait for.
How have you managed to stay alive?
Not on charity or pity or the nobleness of the soul.
I survived because I'm the fittest to survive!
Because I've learned how to kill efficiently!
You must be very strong.
It's my intelligence that keeps me alive and in control of this land.
The big beasts are stupid.
They kill when they're hungry.
But I plan murder ahead.
Do you know how?
No. Tell me.
Their eggs!
I destroy their eggs.
Why, that's...
That's very clever.
And those that I permit to live,
I control with this.
The sound frightens them.
Then it was you who...
Yes. That's how I rule them.
No! Don't!
Stay away from her!
Move away, caveman!
Caveman!
You won't call me that after you've been here for 10 years.
You'll be crawling on your belly like the rest of the beasts, if you live that long.
You're out of your mind.
Don't say that!
Hold it, Jack.
I'm sorry.
I'm sure that he didn't mean to offend you.
The fact that you've been able to survive in this terrible place proves you're a man of superior intelligence.
My name is Roberts.
Margaret Hathaway,
Lieutenant Carmen and Mr. Miller.
Now, who are you?
We crashed.
Four of us.
The '45 expedition.
A plane disappeared with four men aboard.
Four men.
Three are dead, but... Who am l?
I'm Hunter.
Dr. Carl Hunter.
After what he's been through, it's no wonder he's like this.
This is your trouble, isn't it?
That's from our ship. How did you...
After we crashed,
I stored some of the wreckage.
I think you could replace this out of it.
I'll tell you where it is, then the three of you will go, and the woman stays here.
What? Oh, you're really crazy.
You don't seem to understand.
I'm giving you a way out of here, the only way out.
What if we don't go along with your proposition?
You will, and sooner than you think.
Do you see this?
In case you don't remember, it's a gun.
If I have to, I'm gonna blow a hole right through your head.
We'll find the wreck without your help.
Maybe you will, if you aren't trampled to death first or eaten alive or die of starvation.
Wait till the Antarctic night comes and for nine months the black air hangs round you like a rotten rag.
And your eyes are blinded from the dark and from your own sweat.
And you'll lose each other!
And you're alone!
Alone! Do you hear me?
Always alone.
Maggie, get out of here, quick. That way.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey! Hey!
Hey!
Maggie!
Maggie.
I backed into it.
It was horrible! Horrible!
It's all right now.
Where's Hunter? He was here.
Oh, we'll never get out of here, Alan!
Never, never, never!
Stop it! Do you hear me? Stop it!
This doesn't sound like you.
We're not licked yet.
Three lives for one, Alan.
No.
Don't you understand?
It's the only way. I've got to go to him.
We'll find the wreck, I tell you.
We don't have time.
Oh, please, Alan, let me do it.
No, and don't talk anymore.
But why should three of you die...
They've given us up.
They're gonna leave without us.
Oh, shut up, will you?
You know something, Lieutenant, you're a dead duck just like all the rest of us.
You think I'm blind?
We're all gonna die because of her!
That's enough!
He's right, Alan.
We're not making any deals with Hunter, not the kind he wants.
Why don't you let Maggie talk for herself?
You, too, Jack?
What's the matter, Alan?
Losing your sense of humor?
Well, what are we waiting for?
Let's find that wreck.
We got two whole days.
Come on, Steve. Pick up where you left off.
I'll keep on working the south end.
I think, darling, we'd better try...
Maggie!
Maggie, where are you?
Get back! Get back!
Where's that wreck? Where's that wreck?
MAGGlE: Stop it! Stop it!
Not before he talks.
No!
No!
Where is it? Where's that wreck?
Tell me or I'll... Where's that wreck? Talk!
No!
You're gonna rot here.
Talk! Talk!
Get out of my way.
You've lost your mind.
Maybe you wanna stay here for the rest of your life, but not me!
You're not gonna touch him.
Go ahead, Steve.
We're not gonna dig our way out of here through human flesh.
Not Maggie's, Hunter's, not even yours.
Jack.
Get out.
No one asked you to come here.
We want to help you.
I don't need your help or your pity.
We all need pity, and we all need help.
Here. It's a map.
It'll show you where the wreck is.
Take it. And leave me alone.
We'll find it.
If it's true that you can't live among beasts without becoming one, then it's just as true that you can't live among human beings without becoming affected by their humanity.
Let's get started.
Come on, Maggie.
I'll stay with Hunter.
I'll be all right.
We must have passed this place 20 times.
It'll work.
Okay, Jack. Give it a whirl.
Well, if it doesn't run this time, we've had it.
The battery's just about shot.
Jack, is there anything we can do?
Let's check the ignition system again.
I'm going back to camp.
No! You stay here!
Something's happened to them.
Something's happened to them!
Well, she's running smooth as a watch.
Kick in the rotor and let's see what happens.
Yeah, here goes.
What is it, Steve?
The new rod needs adjusting.
We'll be all right.
How about it, Steve?
I need a little more time.
It's okay now!
Let's go.
Look! There's Maggie and Hunter.
Steve! Get the winch ready.
Oh, look!
Jack, get as close as you can.
Right.
Hello, Task Force W. This is Helicopter X-3.
We're airborne and trying to intercept you.
Give us a heading. We're low on fuel.
Repeat, give us a heading,
Hello, Helicopter X-3. Hello, Helicopter X-3.
Our radar has you spotted.
Take a heading of 51 degrees,
We will intercept you,
Proceed to flight deck on the north wind,
We've everything ready for you, Over,
Received your message.
We're coming in. Out.
Hey, there they are!
Probably will be another expedition next year.
Would you like to come along?
No, thanks. I've had it.
Anyway, the OP likes to rotate assignments.
I wasn't thinking of it exactly as an assignment.
Oh? What then?
Well, sort of a honeymoon, sort of?
At the South Pole?
Well, it's one way of keeping warm.
That's ridiculous, Alan.
Yeah, I guess it is.
Why, who'd stay home with the baby?
Sure, who'd stay...
What baby?
Ours, silly.
Why, by this time next year...

Early Spring, 16th Century
The Age of Civil Wars
North shores of Lake Biwa in Omi Province
What could that be?
They must be executing
Shibata's spies.
I need to sell all this before the fighting starts.
Can you sell it in Nagahama?
I hear business is booming there since Lord Hashiba's forces arrived.
- Can't I go with you?
- No, no women.
There's no telling what lawless soldiers will get up to.
Besides, you have to stay and take care of little Genichi.
Go, then, if that's what you want!
Some samurai you'll make, you fool!
How high can a man rise without big dreams?
Ambition must be as boundless as the ocean.
You must be dreaming!
You can't even handle a sword.
You should stick to the trade you know or you'll regret it.
Just wait until I'm rich.
I swear by the god of war,
I'm tired of being poor.
Genjuro, please take me with you.
Still at it?
Forget your foolish dreams.
- Let me pull the cart.
- Stop it, you fool!
He's delusional, he thinks a big future awaits him in Nagahama.
What an idiot!
Back soon, Miyagi.
They're too greedy for their own good.
And not just Tobei. Genjuro, too.
I tell you, quick profits made in chaotic times never last.
A little money inflames men's greed.
They'd do better to prepare for the coming war.
- Tell Genjuro that when he returns.
- I shall.
Thank you for your advice.
Your father's back!
Welcome back.
Here...
Look!
- What's this?
- What do you think?
You got that for your wares?
Feel the weight of it.
Never seen so much, have you?
I hurried back just to show you.
That's what I call trade!
Now do you understand?
What about Tobei?
He came across a fine-looking samurai in Nagahama.
I tried to stop him, but he insisted on following the samurai.
I beg of you, sir! I beg of you!
Please, I beg of you, sir!
Let me be your vassal!
I'll serve you unto death, sir!
- Accept a beggar as a vassal?
- Get some armour first!
- Armour and a spear!
- Get lost, beggar!
Then can I be a samurai?
Get lost!
Not you again?
Get some armour and a spear!
You look so nice!
Happy now?
Very smart indeed.
It's like the Bon festival and New Year's all rolled into one.
For years I've wanted to buy you a kimono but I could never afford it.
Now I finally can!
Just look at your face.
You look so happy!
It's not the kimono but your kindness that makes me so happy.
As long as you're with me,
I want for nothing in life.
Just look at all this...
Dried fish, oil, flour, arrowroot and rice cakes.
Money is everything, see?
Without it life is hard, and all hope dies.
Well, your father's got work to do.
Up we go.
I will earn even more.
I'll try and make as much pottery as I can.
That last small batch brought in three silver coins.
That's enough talk of money.
We have plenty now.
The village chief says Lord Shibata's troops could be here by tomorrow.
We should be careful...
Nonsense!
War's always good for business.
Just look how much I made!
You were fortunate once.
You may not be next time.
- If anything happened to you...
- Stop imagining the worst.
Oh, Ohama...
- Brother...
- You mustn't worry.
No samurai would hire a peasant dressed in rags like him.
Don't you worry, he'll be back.
Have something to drink, here.
You fool!
Have you come to your senses?
You look like a beggar.
You've become the village idiot!
Keep it turning, come on.
Get him out of here!
He's in the way.
We won't make it if we don't hurry.
Stay out of the way, now.
Go and sit down.
Mother, I'm hungry.
What a pest!
Come on, come on, a few more turns!
You're a different man now, always so irritable.
All I want is for us to work in peace as husband and wife, and for the three of us to live happily.
That's all I wish for.
You really worked hard for me this time.
I have a plan, that's why.
Let's sell this new batch in Nagahama.
We'll make a fortune.
- Will I get a share?
- Of course. A third of all we sell.
I can't wait... I can't wait to get my hands on that money.
I've never seen those two work so hard before.
They've thrown everything into this kiln, their strength, their souls, everything.
I don't know what will become of them if it all fails.
Living together as a happy family is enough for me.
But he insists on taking this risk.
Men just won't listen, will they?
Genjuro was always so level-headed before.
War changes people, doesn't it?
At least they're trying to bring in some money.
I wonder what that is.
Wake up, dear. Wake up.
The rumour was true.
They must be Shibata's troops.
See anything, Tobei?
The villagers are scattering like spiders!
- What now?
- We must keep the kiln burning.
I'll be damned if I let that fire go out.
They're pillaging houses and rounding up men.
Genichi!
It's Shibata's army! Hurry, run!
Hurry, hurry!
Hurry!
Halt! We're taking men for forced labour! Don't try to resist!
This is terrible! Run for your lives!
Lord Shibata's troops are here!
They're stealing everything!
Hide your valuables!
- Don't let them get your women!
- Hurry!
They're taking all men into forced labour!
- They're requisitioning everything!
- They're like a pack of wolves.
If only they'd waited one more night!
Hurry, let's run.
It's too dangerous here. Hurry!
If we lose this batch,
I won't get my share of the profits!
You'll lose your life for that kiln!
Come on!
Come now, quickly!
Boil some rice.
We'll need it in the mountains.
Ohama! Ohama, come quickly!
Mother!
Trying to hide, eh?
Come out, damn you!
Help! Please! Help!
Please have mercy! Don't take them!
Don't leave us to starve!
We're begging you!
No, please! No!
Out of my way!
Out of the way, fool!
Help!
It's ready. Here...
Thank you.
Hurry and eat.
- What's happened to him?
- Hopeless fool!
- Have you seen my husband?
- No, I haven't.
Who's there?
It's really quietened down.
The guns are almost silent.
Where are you going?
It's too dangerous.
Wait until the soldiers leave.
Wait. It's best to wait.
I can't wait! I have to go!
- Please don't go!
- I can't let the fire go out!
Forget the kiln!
What if you're caught?
- I can't let the fire go out!
- We can always make more pots.
Silence!
I can't let the pots be ruined.
Ohama! Ohama!
Damn it! The fire's gone out.
- Dear...
- Too late. The fire's gone out.
Damn, it's empty!
- What was that? Is someone hiding?
- Could be something hidden in there.
Have a look.
Nothing but pots.
Let's go.
They're done!
Look! They're fired!
Thank goodness they're done!
They're done!
Thank goodness.
Are they done?
Yes, they are!
And very nicely, too.
- Hurry and load them up.
- So we're off to Nagahama, then?
We can't now.
We'll row across the lake.
Ohama's a boatman's daughter.
You do the rowing, okay?
- Can we get to the lake safely?
- We'll take a shortcut to Onoe.
Will we find a boat?
There are always abandoned ones there.
Hurry, let's unload the kiln.
In the waters of Azuchi
A little boat floats along
All are asleep
Slumped over the rudder...
We've got to be careful, the fog is thick.
Genichi, this is the lake.
Isn't it beautiful?
We're finally out of danger.
I'm glad we decided to go by boat.
If we'd gone overland, we'd probably be dead by now.
We'll reach Omizo by morning.
That's where Lord Niwa has his castle.
The town's even more prosperous than Nagahama.
You and I will be rich men, and our wives will be wealthy women.
I'll build a warehouse in our village.
And I'll buy a suit of armour.
Another boat!
It's a ghost!
No... I'm not a ghost.
I'm a boatman from Kaizu.
I was on the way to Azuchi with my cargo, when I was attacked by pirates.
Water...
Give me water!
Thank you.
Wherever you're headed, be on the lookout for pirates.
If they see you, you'll lose your cargo and your lives.
Take care of your women.
Your women...
Merciful Buddha!
Buddha have mercy on his soul.
Let's turn back.
This is a bad omen.
Let's return the women to shore.
We'll continue alone.
- Please don't go.
- I'm staying... to keep my eye on him.
- They kidnap women.
- I'll risk it.
I'll go wherever you go.
Please take me with you.
- You must look after Genichi.
- Take me with you!
Ohama, take us back to shore.
Quickly!
Tobei, take us back!
We'll be back with the money soon.
We'll return within ten days.
Wait for us.
Don't try to fight if pirates overtake you.
I know, I know.
Don't take the main road.
Remember what I said and take the mountain path.
And don't go back home right away.
Understand?
These misfortunes will soon be over.
Just be patient.
Tobei, Ohama, please look after him for me.
Don't worry, we'll be back soon.
Take good care of Genichi.
You'll be surprised at all the silver we bring back.
Father!
Please be careful!
Come back safely!
- Father!
- Please be careful!
Father!
Buy our wares! Buy our wares!
Tea bowls! Tea bowls!
This? Here you go. Many thanks.
- Sake flasks and cups, too!
- Buy our wares!
- I'd like that vase, please.
- This one, yes?
And that sake flask and those cups.
And can we also take those rice bowls, plates and jars?
Yes... rice bowls, plates and jars.
We live at Kutsuki Manor.
Please deliver them there.
We will pay you then.
Thank you.
- The castle guard approaches!
- Make way for the castle guard!
Don't look!
You'll only get your crazy ideas again.
Shut up!
If I had armour, I could be a samurai.
Sword, spear, armour...
Don't throw away our hard-earned money.
- Leave me alone!
- Brother!
- Tobei!
- Let go of me!
Next time we meet,
I'll be a great samurai.
Please stop him!
Tobei! Tobei!
That got rid of her.
- May I help you?
- A suit of armour, please!
Tobei!
- Do I look like a samurai?
- Yes, and a fine one.
- But you need a spear.
- I'll take one!
Here you are.
How much?
One silver piece.
Pretty, isn't she?
Let me go!
What are you doing?
Damn you!
Murderers!
There's some money for you.
Bastards!
Look what's become of me.
Satisfied now, Tobei, seeing your wife reduced to this?
What do you care, anyway, now you think you're a samurai?
Tobei, you wretched fool!
You fool, Tobei!
Would you watch over my stall until my partners return?
- Of course.
- They should be back soon. Thanks.
Sir, how much is one of these?
Are you looking to buy?
Depends on the price.
They're too luxurious for the wife of a man like you.
I've got money.
Excuse me.
We thought you might need us to show you the way.
That's very kind of you.
Please follow us.
Please come in.
Well... Thank you, but I should be getting back.
Lady Wakasa is waiting for you.
Please come inside.
You say "Lady Wakasa"...
Are you referring to the young lady?
Yes, she is the daughter of the late Lord Kutsuki.
Now please come through.
No need to stand on ceremony.
Many thanks.
Come through.
Please...
Please, come.
You are Master Genjuro of Omi province, are you not?
How does your ladyship know my name?
When I saw your ceramics at the market,
I could hardly believe my eyes.
The blue glaze on your pots gleamed as brightly as crystal.
My father taught me a certain appreciation of such things.
I wanted to meet you, to ask how you manage to create such beautiful objects.
But perhaps it is a trade secret, not meant for outsiders?
No, my lady, there is no special trade secret.
But it takes many years' experience to handle the clay and apply the glaze.
The fruit of experience is beauty, but only a master craftsman can create such beauty.
Thank you, my lady.
These are my wares, aren't they?
I wanted to taste sake from your cups.
You're fortunate, my little ones, to catch this noble lady's eye.
I'm a farmer, so the pottery is just a sideline, but I feel for my creations, as if they were my own children.
That such a noble lady would look kindly upon them is a great honour.
To see them in such a grand residence, graced by the touch of so beautiful a lady, is like a dream come true.
Not at all. They must be saddened by the touch of one fallen on hard times, such as myself.
Please, take a cup.
My wares have never looked so beautiful.
The value of people and objects truly depends on their setting.
My wares must be at a loss to find themselves in such a noble manor.
Your talent must not be hidden away in some poor, remote village.
You must strive to deepen and enrich your gift.
And how might I do that, my lady?
By swearing your love for Lady Wakasa, and pledging your troth to her at once.
The finest silk
Of choicest hue
May change and fade away
As would my life
My beloved
If thou shouldst prove untrue
Our vow to love for a thousand years... is sealed with this cup...
His voice sounds overjoyed!
That is the voice of my late father.
The entire House of Kutsuki was wiped out by Oda Nobunaga, that detestable Oda Nobunaga.
The only survivors of the purge were her ladyship and myself, her nurse.
But the spirit of the late daimyo lingers in the palace, and it sings like this every time her ladyship dances.
Is it not a splendid voice?
He's expressing his delight at her ladyship's impending marriage.
Whenever I hear the voice of my late father...
It's too early to rise.
Please sleep as long as you like.
What am I doing here?
What a thing to say...
...as if you'd forgotten everything.
Is my lord awake?
Lead your husband by the hand to the spring and bathe him.
I won't intrude upon you any further.
You have such a look of distrust on your face.
You think I'm some kind of enchantress, don't you?
But you're mine, you belong to me now.
From now on, you must devote your entire life to me.
This love
This love of ours has driven me to madness...
Even if you are a ghost or enchantress,
I'll never let you go.
I never imagined such pleasures existed.
This is exquisite! It's paradise!
Help me! Help me!
Somebody, please help!
Someone, help me!
See any food?
Quickly, quickly!
Pull yourself together.
Come with me.
Come quickly!
- Take these rice cakes and this.
- I'll never forget your kindness.
You'll be all right if you take the back road.
- To the left.
- Many thanks.
Be careful.
Here!
It's mine!
- Hey... you got any food?
- We're starving to death.
That food's for my son.
Please don't take it!
Do me the honour of beheading me.
I've brought you a head! A head!
A general's head!
Please, my lord!
- What is it?
- Please look at this!
You found the head of a great general.
No, I didn't find it, my lord.
I killed him with my spear!
Who'd believe a warrior like Fuwa Katsuhige would let a mere foot soldier kill him?
A lucky find, but you'll be rewarded all the same.
What would you like?
A horse, armour and vassals.
Very well. You shall have them.
Thank you, my lord!
You're a clever one, aren't you?
He looks like a fine samurai.
What clan does he belong to?
- He killed Fuwa, the great general.
- What's his name?
Tobei of Nakanogo, one of Lord Niwa's top men.
Pay homage, that you may be so lucky.
Beautiful girls are waiting for brave warriors!
We have the finest sake and fish!
Please come inside!
I can't let you pass, sir!
Come and look.
We have beautiful girls inside.
- What's going on?
- Chief, perhaps we can rest here.
No, I'm heading directly home.
I have someone waiting for me, and she must see me in all my glory.
Chief, why not let us celebrate your triumph?
- Your men are looking forward to it.
- I see. Very well.
I, Nakanogo Tobei of Lord Niwa's army, will rest here.
- Prepare some tables.
- He'll rest here. Show your gratitude.
Thank you, sir.
Make way!
Clear the way for Master Tobei!
Welcome.
- Which one is this Tobei?
- Him, over there.
Him?
I heard of his great exploits.
May I drink from your cup so your luck rubs off on me?
Me, too!
How did you manage to kill such a great general?
Yes, tell us, so we may do as you did!
A guide for future action!
There's nothing much to tell.
First, you need brains.
You need knowledge.
Then, a strong arm.
Skill on the battlefield.
Martial artistry.
Speed to seize the moment.
The ability to see life in perspective.
Then you'll be wise as Kongming, the great Chinese military strategist.
But above all, keep a clear, discerning mind.
- Got that?
- Indeed.
For military tactics, study the Kusunoki and Koshu schools.
For firearms, Kanamaru school.
For the spear, Otsubo school.
Next you need to know fortifications and fortresses.
Then defensive tactics,
V-formations and the like...
Hey! My money!
Let me go!
Crazy bitch!
- Someone stop him!
- Hey, what's going on?
- Let go of me!
- He's trying to run off like a thief!
I don't give money to wenches like you.
Scoundrel!
Making a plaything of me.
This will do just fine, thanks!
Ohama! Ohama!
So you're the big man now?
You've finally become the great samurai of your dreams, eh?
While you've made your way to the top,
I've made quite a name for myself.
In my fancy kimono and make-up, drinking fine sake,
I bed a different man every night.
Some success for a woman, isn't it?
Happy now?
This is what you wanted.
Success always comes at a price, and we pay in suffering.
I may be a fallen woman, but your success wipes the slate clean.
Come!
Be my customer tonight and we'll celebrate.
Buy this fallen woman with your money!
Ohama.
Without you, my success means nothing.
That's a lie! My fate meant nothing, as long as you became a samurai.
No, no, no, you're wrong.
Ohama!
I thought you'd be proud if I made good.
I never dreamed you'd be brought to this.
I'm a defiled woman.
And you're to blame!
- Can you restore my honour?
- I can.
- Otherwise, I have to die!
- I can!
I swear I'll restore your honour.
How many times I've wanted to die, but I had to see you first!
I hated myself for it, I hated myself, but I couldn't die without seeing you first!
I couldn't die... I couldn't die!
This...
...and this. Thank you.
I don't quite have enough.
Could you lower the price?
In that case, I'll take this back.
I really wanted that.
Come to Kutsuki Manor and I'll pay you the rest.
- Kutsuki Manor?
- Yes, at the foot of the mountain.
Take it all, and go away!
Keep your money, too. Just go away!
- Wait.
- How can I help you, Priest?
I sense something evil... an ill omen.
- What is it?
- Let me look closely at your face.
- My face?
- Yes.
We can't talk here.
Please follow me.
Very well...
The shadow of death is upon your face.
Has some strange apparition crossed your path, perhaps?
No, not at all.
Have you no home, no family?
If others depend on you, you must return to them at once.
If you remain here any longer, you will forfeit your life.
Return home quickly.
But why?
Do not ask the reason.
Your life is at stake.
But I spend my days happily with Lady Wakasa at Kutsuki Manor.
- She is a spirit of the dead.
- What nonsense.
This love of yours is forbidden.
Do you not love your wife and child?
Would you forsake your life and abandon them, too?
Wait!
Go then, if you must, but I cannot let you walk into the jaws of death.
I will exorcise this ghost.
Come.
When you realise how terrifying this spirit is, you'll come to your senses.
Oh... how beautiful!
Such lovely jewellery!
You've made me so happy!
How thoughtful of you, sir.
I'm so relieved.
You were so late in returning that I grew terribly worried.
But you look troubled, my dear.
What has happened?
What is it?
You must not leave here again.
Since the fall of our clan, people have treated us with nothing but contempt and slander our name.
What a wretched world!
Genjuro,
I want you never to leave my side again.
Let's leave this manor and return to my native province.
Genjuro, you are my husband for life.
You will accompany me, won't you?
Please forgive me.
I've been...
I've been lying to you.
I have a wife and child.
I left them back home in the chaos of the war.
You must leave all that behind you now.
Please let me go!
No!
I refuse to let you go.
So, you will come with me to my native province...
...immediately.
What is it, my lady?
- He has something on his skin!
- His skin?
Genjuro, did you...?
- Did you...?
- On your skin?
You must wash away what's on your skin!
Why did you wed her if you were already married?
I don't know... How could I have made such a terrible mistake?
A mistake for a man perhaps, but for a woman, it's far worse.
Please forgive me.
Let me go.
Certainly not!
Wipe off those Sanskrit prayers to the Buddha and that curse, or we will never forgive you!
Genjuro, how could you even think of doing something so dreadful?
All I wish is to remain forever by your side.
For all eternity.
Lady Wakasa departed this world without ever having known love in her life.
It grieved my heart to see her so sorrowful.
I wanted her ladyship to enjoy fully the pleasures of a woman's life, so I chose to return with her, to wander this world.
Our hopes were fulfilled when she met a good man like you and found a love that occurs only once a lifetime.
And now, when she has at last found joy, you speak of returning home, never to see each other again.
Does it not pain you to know that you may ruin her ladyship's only chance of happiness?
Do you feel no remorse?
Master Genjuro, you must banish these dreadful thoughts and stay by her side forever...
Please forgive me! Forgive me!
Genjuro!
Genjuro!
This is the man!
Hey, you! Get up!
- What are you doing?
- You shameless thief!
You stole a sacred treasure from the shrine.
- You're wrong! I didn't steal it.
- Silence!
This sacred sword disappeared a month ago.
That can't be! It belongs to Lady Wakasa at Kutsuki Manor.
- Kutsuki Manor, you say?
- That's right!
You must've been dreaming.
This is where it stood before the clan was wiped out.
He's lying through his teeth!
Where in the manor did you find the sword?
He's suspicious. Search him.
That's my money!
Give it back!
Silence! In peace time, we'd throw you in jail, but Shibata's army burned it down.
Be thankful for that, you lucky bastard.
The finest silk
Of choicest hue
May change and fade away
As would my life
My beloved
Miyagi.
Miyagi!
- I'm sorry I was gone so long.
- You're back!
I knew you'd be worried about me.
But you're all right...
I'm so happy to see you're all right.
- Genichi?
- He's asleep.
Let me hold him, let me hold him.
Genichi...
Genichi, I'm back! I'm back!
Your father's returned.
Let me hold you, let me hold you...
I wanted to bring you back fine presents, but this is all I have.
I... I made a terrible mistake!
Don't say another word, my dear.
You've returned safely to us.
I realise now how right you were.
My mind was warped.
Let's not speak of it anymore.
You must be exhausted.
I have some sake prepared.
And there's a stew ready in the pot.
I feel so relieved.
Sake never tasted so good.
It's so peaceful here.
Come, Genichi.
I'll put you to bed.
I haven't had a moment's peace since I left here, but I'm home at last... home at last...
Home at last... home at last...
Is someone in there?
Open the door!
Is someone in there?
Open up.
- Village chief!
- Genjuro! You're back?
Yes. Thank you for all your kindness in my absence.
Oh, there you are, my boy!
I was worried,
I didn't know where you'd gone.
What a relief.
What a relief.
The boy must have heard you were back.
Hey, Miyagi...
Miyagi!
Genjuro...
Are you dreaming?
Dreaming?
Miyagi was killed by soldiers of the defeated army.
Killed?
She'd have been so happy to see you back safely.
Poor thing.
Merciful Buddha...
Ever since Miyagi died,
I've been looking after your boy in my house.
I was so afraid when he suddenly disappeared last night.
The bond between parent and child is strong.
But how could he have known that you'd returned?
To hell with this... and this...
...and this!
I told you so, but you were too stupid to learn except through misfortune.
The war drove us mad with ambition.
Don't let my suffering be in vain.
Pull yourself together and work hard.
Why did you have to die?
Miyagi, why did you have to die?
I did not die.
I am at your side.
Your delusion has come to an end
You are again your true self in the place where you belong.
Your work is waiting...
What a beautiful shape!
Helping you spin the wheel is my greatest pleasure.
How I long to see it when it's fired
The firewood is cut and ready
The rampaging soldiers are gone.
$0 make your wonderful pottery in peace.
50 many things have happened
You've finally become the man I had hoped for.
But alas
..I am no longer among the living.
Such is the way of the world.
You must be tired. Rest a while.
Here, Genichi. It's delicious.
Eat it while it's hot.
Brother, eat before it gets cold.
Once in the Highlands

Here's Auchindale.
''As l remember, that should be on the left, and l don't remember.'' lt is.
Here's Braekirk.
Should be on the right.
-Then where the devil are we?
-What's in the middle?
-Nothing.
-That's where we are.
-Nothing?
-Yep.
For a fellow of my potentialities... this is an ideal location.
We'll find our way out when the mist clears.
Must be depressing to be a bird... and know the hunting season is on.
''The way you aim, the birds have nothing to worry about.''
Yeah? Watch.
Wait a second.
That isn't a grouse.
Fine couple of game hunters we are.
''We come here from New York, and the first night out, we get lost.''
Maybe we took the high road instead of the low road.
''-Like a drink?
-No, thanks.''
Good. That leaves more for me.
You told me you were gonna cut down.
''Yes, l did, but l'm a terrible liar.''
''Besides, it doesn't pay.'' l remember l was going with a wonderful girl once... and she used to plead with me to give it up.
''So, one day l did.''
''We discovered we had nothing more to talk about, so we broke up.''
There's something about this forest... that gives me the feeling of being in a cathedral.
''lf we were, l'd know where the exit is.''
''-You don't believe in anything, do you?
-Of course l do.''
Really? What?
Practically anything l can understand.
Anything that's real to me.
''Things l can touch, taste, hear, see, smell and swallow.''
What about the things you don't understand? l dismiss 'em.
''Makes it very easy, doesn't it?''
''Comfortable, anyhow.''
-l envy you.
-Why?
You seem so satisfied. l am. Aren't you?
''No, l'm not.''
That's the silliest thing l ever heard.
You've got a fine job and you're engaged to a fine girl.
You're lost in a fine forest.
What more do you want? l don't know.
Something seems wrong.
Especially about Jane and me.
That makes everything seem wrong.
Look how l postponed getting married. l can't get myself to that altar.
Don't you love her?
You did when we left New York.
Sometimes l think l'm really not capable of loving.
Sometimes l think nobody is anymore.
That's nonsense.
Don't start talking yourself into an inferiority complex.
-You don't deserve it.
-What do you mean?
Most of my friends who have an inferiority complex are right.
They're not as good as everybody else.
''But you-- young, dashing, loaded.''
Hey. Look at that.
-lt looks like a village.
-lt is. l thought you said there were no towns on the map around here.
''-l did. You wanna see the map?
-No, l believe you.''
Let's go down.
There must be people down there.
They must eat food.
That's what we're interested in.
Funny it isn't on the map.
Maybe they don't like publicity.
Jean. Jean!
-Come away from the window.
-l'm tryin' to see Charlie.
''l know you are, and you're not supposed to.''
'Tis bad luck to see the groom before the weddin'.
Put the clothes in the chest.
Do you think he's glad he's marryin' me... or do you think he's beginnin' to regret it?
''Well, if l see him...'' l'll ask him.
''Now, hurry up.''
''Father, how did ye feel when Mother agreed to marry ye?'' l didn't propose to her.
She proposed to me.
Didn't it make you happy?
''Aye, her good judgment pleased me highly.''
''Fiona, you'll be sure to see Charlie and tell him...'' to come over to sign the family Bible.
''-Aye, Father.
-l'm off to see Mr. Lundie.''
Attend to the marketing.
Buy everything that's needed for the weddin' supper.
''-Aye.
-But remember, just what's needed.''
My aim for this occasion is to be hospitable... not philanthropic.
When you gonna think about marriage for yourself?
When l find someone who makes me think of it.
You've never met anyone up 'til now that made you think of it?
''No, not as yet.''
Doesn't that worry you?
''Aye, a little...'' but l'm not gonna let it worry me into marryin' the wrong one.
Many a lassie as everyone knows'll
Try to be married before 25
So she'll agree to most any proposal
All he must be is a man and alive l hold a dream and there's no compromisin' l know there's one certain laddie for me
One day he'll come walkin' o'er the horizon
But should he not
Then an old maid l'll be
Foolish ye may say
Foolish l will stay
Waitin' for my dearie
And happy am l
To hold my heart
'til he comes
Strollin' by
'' When he comes, my dearie''
One look and l'll know
That he's the dearie l've been wantin' so
Though l'll live 40 lives
'Til the day he arrives
'' l'll not ever, ever grieve''
For my hope will be high
That he'll come strollin' by
For you see l believe
That
There's a laddie weary
And wanderin' free
Who's waitin'
For his dearie
Me
What do you do while you're waitin' around
For your lad to come your way
'' Well, when no one is lookin'''
You kneel on the ground
And you pray and pray
And pray
But when lassies sit and have no men
'' Oh, how long becomes the night''
But l fear the night is longer when
The lad's not right
Waitin' for my dearie ls sweeter to me
Than wooin' any laddie
On the lea
Dreamin' of your dearie
And idlin' the day
That's how l am
And how l'll always stay
Though l'll live 40 lives
'til the day he arrives
'' l'll not ever, ever grieve''
For my hopes will be high
That he'll come strollin' by
For you see l believe
That
There's a laddie weary
And wanderin' free
Who's waitin'
For his dearie
Me
''Good mornin', Fiona!''
Thanks.
''-Good mornin', Miss Fiona.
-Good mornin', Mr. Beaton.''
-Good day.
-What would you be lookin' for?
A waistcoat for my father for the weddin'.
''Of course. Jean and young Dalrymple are gettin' married today, aren't they?''
''lf she had to choose someone other than my son, Harry...'' l'm glad 'twas a lad as fine as Charlie.
Would you have a waistcoat of this that would fit him? l think so. l'll have Harry run over to the house and see.
''Friends, your attention, please!''
This is the second day of our blessing... and so to remind ye...
Mr. Lundie has drawn up a map of our town... and asked me to hang it in the public square here... where ye all can see it and be reminded.
''Now, the boundaries of our village are:''
''To the east, the bridge.
To the west, the old kirk road.''
''To the north, the stone fence at the edge of the forest...''
''and to the south, Loch Harold.''
Let no one cross... or we shall be ungrateful before God... and night shall fall upon us forever.
The second day of whose blessin'?
'Tis for certain not mine.
-l'm truly sorry.
-Do not be.
''lf anyone's goin' to pity me, let it be me.''
'Tis not fair for Charlie Dalrymple to be weddin' her.
He's got everything-- school in Edinburgh and now Jean-- and l've got nothing.
Nothing but to be trapped in this peasant village all my life.
Look at it.
The boundaries of a town?
Not to me.
'Tis more the dimensions of my jail.
''Hey, sonny, could you tell us where we could get some breakfast?''
That kid's gonna have problems when he grows up.
Pardon me. Could you tell us where we could find a local inn?
What is this? ls there a place around here where we could get some breakfast?
''-l do not know, sir.
-What do you know? lt talks.''
What's the name of this town? l do not know.
You'll have to excuse me.
You're in Brigadoon.
-Good morning.
-Good morning.
You must forgive him. l imagine he was a wee bit taken back.
People do not come here very often.
What did you say the name of this town is?
Brigadoon.
That's funny. lt isn't on the map. l should not be surprised.
You know it isn't on the map?
Aye.
''That's a little snobbish of you, don't you think?''
-Why isn't it on the map?
-For good reason.
''Well, look, Miss, uh--''
-Campbell.
-Thank you.
We're trying to get some breakfast. ls there an inn around here?
An inn? l do not think so.
''But if you follow the road, you'll come to MacConnachy Square.''
You can find all the food you want for sale there.
Thank you very much.
You're more than welcome.
Good day.
Good day.
Good day.
Good day.
Good day.
Look!
Funny clothes they wear around here.
Maybe this is the day they take pictures for postcards.
Hello. lt couldn't be me. There must be something peculiar about you.
''This milk is for sale, isn't it?''
-Aye.
-Do you mind if l help myself?
''One moment, sir. l'll have to see your money first.''
-My money?
-Show 'im the money.
-Look at the date!
-Funny-lookin' thing.
What did you give 'em?
A hunk of uranium?
''No, just a shilling.
What a loony layout this is.''
''Aye, 'tis very interesting, sir...'' but it does me no good.
You mean you won't sell me anything?
''l'm sorry, sir. l cannot.''
Why not?
''l cannot explain further, sir.''
They just happened in a wee while ago.
''Well, welcome to Brigadoon.
How did you gentlemen get here?''
''We came from Graymore, six miles yonder.''
Six miles.
That's quite a distance.
''You must be hungry. Angus, how about some breakfast for our visitors?''
''Charlie, their money--'' l do not want their money.
''This is my weddin' day, laddie.
You're my invited guests.''
''Help yourselves.
Bread, scones, ginger cakes.''
''Oh, but first, a bit o' heather ale.''
Sandy!
-Here l am.
-Some ale for our guests.
Ale for everybody!
So you're getting married today.
That's wonderful.
''Aye, it is.''
''This afternoon, to Miss Jean Campbell.''
-Campbell?
-Aye. l think l met your bride a few minutes ago. She's very charming.
''Aye, that she is.''
Her health.
Her health!
-To our visitors!
-Here!
And to Mr. Forsythe. l hope he knows how grateful l am to him... to postponin' the miracle for me.
''-That what?
-'Tis a toast we have here, sir.''
And may God bless me this evenin' as much as l would bless him... if l were he and he were Charles Dalrymple. l guess we'll not be seein' you at the tavern anymore.
''Aye, lads.
My tavern days are over.'' l used to be a rovin' lad
A rovin' and wanderin' life l had
On any lass l'd frown
Who would try to tie me down
But then one day l saw a maid
Who held out her hand and l stayed and stayed
And now across the green l'll go home with bonnie Jean
'' Go home, go home''
Go home with bonnie Jean
'' Go home, go home'' l'll go home with bonnie Jean ln Aberdeen l used to know
A lass with an air an' her name was Jo
And every night at 10:00 l would meet her in the glen
But now you'll not see her again
Especially not in the glen at 10:00
For now across the green
You'll--
Go home with bonnie Jean
'' Go home, go home''
Go home with bonnie Jean
'' Go home, go home'' l'll go home with bonnie Jean
Hello to married men l've known l'll soon have a wife and leave yours alone
A bonnie wife indeed
And she's all l'll ever need
You wanted her at any cost
But how do you know if you've won or lost
And still across the green
You'll go home with bonnie Jean
'' Go home, go home''
Go home with bonnie Jean
'' Go home, go home''
You'll
Go home with bonnie Jean
''-Oh, you can't stop now!
-Go on!''
'' Go home, go home''
Go home with bonnie Jean
'' Go home, go home'' l'll go home with bonnie Jean
'' Go home, go home''
Go home with bonnie Jean
'' Go home, go home'' l'll go home with bonnie Jean
'' Go home, go home''
Go home with bonnie Jean
'' Go home, go home'' l'll go home
With bonnie
'' - Jean
- Go home, go home''
'' Go home, go home go home, go home''
'' Go home with bonnie Jean, aye''
Meg Brockie just told me at the back window... there are two strangers in town.
-Aye.
-Ya mean ya know it?
Why didn't ya tell me?
Did ya see them?
-Aye.
-Tell me about them.
What are they like?
How do they look?
''He has brownish hair, a wee bit taller than father.''
-Very nice face.
-What about the other one?
''The other? He's about the same, l imagine.'' l really cannot remember. l only saw them for a moment.
Where are they?
Where did they go?
To the square for some food.
They've probably left by now.
Maybe they haven't. l'm goin' to see. l'll pick up the bread for ya.
Jean! Are you daft?
How can you even think of goin' out today?
Supposin' you run into Charlie.
Do you want to start out your marriage under a cloud of bad luck?
''-l'll get the bread.
-Oh, but, Fiona--''
Who ever heard of a bride bein' seen on the day of her weddin'? l'm surprised at you for even thinkin' of it.
Lovely.
''Oh, you're a winnin' lad.
A right winnin' lad!''
''You've noticed that, have you?''
Do you have a wife? l never touch the stuff. l don't believe in marriage. l've seen too many happy love affairs broken up by it.
''Oh, you're a braw and handsome lad,
Mr. Douglas.''
You should see me when l'm rested. l'm almost robust.
We do not have enough lads in Brigadoon.
''Enough for everybody else, or enough for you?''
There are so few single lads in town. lt's hard for a lass to catch a husband. lt would be so nice if ya could stay a while. Could ya? l'll have to ask my pop.
We came over here to hunt grouse.
And coming from this hill--
''-Oh.
-Good mornin', dearie.''
Father asked me to remind ya... to be sure and come sign the family Bible this afternoon. l'll be over.
''-How was breakfast, sir?
-Wonderful. Thanks.''
Where's my bride?
She's home... palpitatin'. lsn't that your bride?
''No, lad.
That's her older sister, Fiona.''
-Do you mind if l have more ale?
-Help yourself.
''Here, old tank.
Amuse yourself.'' l thought we were going hunting. l am.
See you at the weddin'.
Can l carry that for you?
''No, thank you. l do not have far to go with it.''
''You're very busy today, aren't you?''
''-Aye, my sister--
-They told me she's getting married.''
-l was overjoyed.
-That's very kind of ya.
''Not at all. ln this case, her happiness is mine.''
''Besides, Charlie's a nice kid.''
''Aye, he is that.'' lt's wonderfully refreshing these days... to see someone so enthusiastic about getting married.
-ls it so unusual?
-l think so. l was thinking of facing the minister once... and l certainly wasn't bubbling over like Charlie.
Oh?
''Oh, what?'' l'm very surprised.
You do not look like the sort of lad who'd be thinkin' of settlin' down. l didn't say that. l just said l was thinking of getting married.
''Well, if ya felt that way...''
'tis a very good thing ya didn't.
''Yes, l suppose it was a very good thing l didn't.''
''-Good mornin', Fiona.
-Good day, Mrs. Maclntosh.''
-This is--
-Albright. Tommy Albright.
-Likewise.
-He's just passin' through.
Where do ya come from?
From America.
You're an American? lsn't that all right?
''Aye, of course.''
''-The bread, Mrs. Maclntosh.
-Aye.''
Andrew! Come to the window and look at the stranger!
He's an American.
She gives us bread for our potatoes.
-That's nice.
-She's a very nice lady.
'Tis just that--
People don't come here very often.
Aye. You're very understandin'.
''No, l'm not.'' l don't understand one thing about this place.
The bread will be ready in an hour. l'll bring it to your cottage.
''-Thank you, Mrs. Maclntosh.
-Good day.''
Good day. l've been wanting to do that all day.
Now where? l must gather some heather for the weddin' decorations.
Where do you do that?
''On the far hill, where the heather is.''
Do you mind if l come along?
-Why did ya want to?
-Why?
''Oh, l don't know exactly.''
Maybe it's because l've nothing much else to do.
Or maybe it's because l'm so full of wonder about this place... and want to stay a little longer.
Or maybe it's because l remember how relieved l was... when l found out it was your sister's wedding day and not yours.
Can't we two go walkin' together
Out beyond the valley of trees
Out where there's a hillside of heather
Curtsyin' gently in the breeze
That's what l'd like to do
See the heather
But with you
The mist of May is in the gloamin'
And all the clouds are holdin' still
So take my hand and let's go roamin'
Through the heather on the hill
The mornin' dew is blinkin' yonder
There's lazy music in the rill
And all l wanna do is wander
Through the heather on the hill
There may be other days as rich and rare
There may be other springs as full and fair
But they won't be the same
They'll come and go
For this l know
That when the mist is in the gloamin'
And all the clouds are holdin' still lf you're not there l won't go roamin'
Through the heather on the hill
The heather
On the hill
''-Here's your waistcoat, Mr. Campbell.
-Thank you, Harry.''
'Tis good to see ya.
''-Wait a minute, lad.
-What for?''
Why don't ya take my hand? l'm not your enemy.
''Ye may not mean to be, but ye are, and so is everybody in this town.''
Why do ya hate everybody? l couldn't get through seein' her marry someone else if l didn't.
What else can ya do when ya realize your life means less than nothin'? l cannot leave here. l cannot go to the university and make something o' myself... and l cannot have Jean.
So there's nothin' left to do but to hate everything and everybody... in this cursed town.
''You'll never find peace by hatin', lad.'' lt only shuts ya off more from the world... and this is only a cursed town if ya make it so.
''To the rest of us,
'tis a blessed place.''
Who was that?
My waistcoat came.
You should be gettin' ready. l was waitin' for Fiona.
Where is she?
She's been gone for hours.
Go to your room.
Close the door.
''Charlie, go 'round to the window.''
Here's the Bible.
There's the quill and ink.
Now sit ye down there and sign right under the name... of my dear departed wife.
''And when you've done that, take your leave!''
''Aye, sir.''
This is where l come all day and tend my flock.
''When l say it sounds fascinating, l want you to believe me.''
-lt's a very picturesque view.
-Thank ya.
-What for?
-For likin' where l've brought ya. lt makes me very happy.
''-You get happy very easily, don't you?
-Aye.'' l haven't been in a shed like this since l was in college...
''which at this point seems a good 2,000 years ago.''
''-Ya mean you're tired?
-Aye, lassie, l'm tired.''
''That's what you brought me here for, wasn't it, so l could take a nap?'' l should not think a long walk would fatigue a young lad like ye.
''-A young lad?
-Aye, you're very young.''
That's either a deliberate lie or wishful thinking.
''l am ancient, decrepit and disintegrating rapidly.''
My mother and father met in this shed.
We all make mistakes.
My mother was a gypsy... and one day she was walkin' past this shed... and she saw my father lyin' down asleep.
''She liked his looks, and she was achin' for a husband.''
''So, she took off her shoes, sat in the rocking chair there...'' and waited for him to wake up.
And it was not long after that that l was born.
That's one of the sweetest bedtime stories l've ever heard.
''What's under here, your father?''
Thank you very much.
You've been more than kind.
''Now, if you want to round out your generosity, buzz off.'' l just hate to leave ya.
''You better. When l sleep, l make all sorts of odd noises.''
Who told ya?
Ya do not have a wife. l was engaged once.
You're a right winnin' lad.
You should have someone to take care of ya. l don't know what you're after. l just wanna go to sleep.
Now go!
Go?
But do ya not see? l'm highly attracted to ya.
''Why, when l look at ya, l feel wee tadpoles jumpin' in my spine.''
That's about as repulsive an idea as l've heard in years.
''lf love were a hobby, you'd be a collector's item.''
All you men are all alike.
-l should certainly hope so.
-You're all brutes!
Ya get what ya want from a lass an' then 'tis farewell!
Get what l want? l can't even get you to go away!
That's what l'm referrin' to. l thought ya wanted to propose to me.
That's why ya brought me here.
You misled me.
You sure have one lulu of an imagination.
''Can you think of one good reason why l, a strange man...''
''should be interested in proposing to you, a mighty strange woman...'' and at this hour of the day?
''Because you're a lad, and l'm a lass.''
''With that philosophy, you must have had a provocative career.''
Now go. Be off.
Away with ya.
-But--
-Go tend your flock.
''Fiona! There's some white heather, lots of it.''
''Tommy, stop!''
There isn't any white heather over there.
Of course there is.
There's plenty--
What is it?
What frightened you?
'Tis nothin'. ls it the bridge? Why do you have such a look of fear on your face? l cannot say.
Why can't you?
''Fiona, what's the matter?
What's going on around here?''
What was all that business about Charlie and a miracle?
''Hey, look out! Tommy!''
What happened? Tommy!
Are you all right?
''lf there's anything l hate, it's you.''
Any civilized person would be dead by now.
Maybe the sun gave me the power
For l could swim Loch Lomond and be home in half an hour
Maybe the air gave me the drive
For l'm all aglow
And alive
What a day this has been
What a rare mood l'm in
Why it's almost like bein' in love
There's a smile on my face
For the whole human race
'' Why, it's almost like bein' in love''
All the music of life seems to be
Like a bell that is ringin' for me
And from the way that l feel
When that bell starts to peal l could swear l was fallin' l would swear l was fallin' lt's almost like bein' ln love
When we walked up the brae
Not a word did we say lt was
And her arm linked in mine
Made the world kind of fine lt was
'' Why, it's''
Almost like bein' in love
'' Why, it's almost like bein' in love''
Life seems to be
Like a bell that keeps ringin'
For me
And from the way that l feel
When that bell starts to peal l would swear l was fallin' l could swear l was fallin' lt's almost like bein' ln love
-Aren't we headin' back?
-There's no hurry.
Let's stick around a while.
There's gonna be a wedding.
''-Yours?
-Oh, very funny.'' l thought we came to Scotland to go grouse shooting. l'd like to get one little bird before the day is over.
-What's the matter?
-Hey. l must be a little touched.
Listen to this.
''''''Married: Elizabeth Lang to Andrew Campbell...''
''''''July 2nd, 1719.''''''
What about it?
People used to get married then.
''No, wait a minute.
''''Children: Fiona.''
''''''Born October 10th, 1732.''
''''''Jean. Born April 8th, 1736.''''''
Well?
Fiona told me Jean's four years younger.
-Well?
-They're the sisters in this Bible!
That's ridiculous.
They're probably just named after them.
''-You know Charlie's last name, right?
-Dalrymple, isn't it?''
''Dalrymple, yes.
Get this.''
''''''Married: Jean Campbell to
Charles Chisholm Dalrymple...''
''''''May 24th, 1754.''''''
Now what do you say?
Congratulations. l don't understand.
No Brigadoon on the map.
All those odd things that happened when l was out with Fiona this afternoon... all that stuff about a miracle... and now this.
Why are you getting so worked up?
''lf it makes 'em happy to disregard
200 years of human bing-bang, let 'em.''
''There must be a logical explanation for this, logical enough even for you.''
You don't have to explain anything to me. l don't care.
What's the matter? ls that your name in this Bible?
Aye.
Someone seems to have messed up your book.
What does it mean?
You must tell me.
''There is an explanation for it, isn't there?''
''Aye, there is, but l cannot tell ya.'' ls there anybody who can? l've got to know.
-You must talk with the dominie.
-Who?
''Our schoolmaster, Mr. Lundie.''
''-Where does he live?
-Down the road in a tree, maybe.''
''He does not live in a tree, Mr. Douglas.
Mr. Lundie's a great man.''
''All right, Tommy, l'll take you to him.'' l hadn't wanted to... because it'll be so hard for you to believe what you'll hear.
And l wanted-- l wanted you to stay with me...
'til the end of our day.
Take us to see Mr. Lundie.
Aye.
''ls it informal, or should l wear my Napoleon hat?''
''Good day, Mr. Lundie.''
''Why, hello, Fiona.
What a pleasant surprise.''
''Mr. Lundie, l'd like you to meet Mr. Tommy Albright...'' and Mr. Jeff Douglas.
''-Good afternoon, gentlemen.
-How do you do, sir?''
Good afternoon.
Where do you gentlemen come from?
-We're from New York.
-New York?
We changed it from New Amsterdam.
-So l understand.
-The British changed it.
''Confidentially, though, as soon as
Washington organizes himself...''
''we're gonna chase them out, but keep it under your hat.''
''Put a cork in it, will you, Jeff?''
''Mr. Lundie, l was wonderin' if you'd be good enough...'' to tell these gentlemen about Brigadoon.
They've heard and they've seen a great deal... and they're very perplexed indeed.
-Perplexed is right.
-l would very much like him-- l mean them--to know. l see.
''-Will you not be seated, gentlemen?
-Thank you.''
''From what l gather, nobody can talk about the place around here but you.''
''-ls that right?
-No, that's wrong.''
Mr. Forsythe could've told ya.
''Forsythe? l've heard about him, but l didn't meet him.''
Likely not. l think he's dead.
''That would stand in the way, l suppose.''
''Let me warn you that what l'm goin' to tell ya, ya will not believe.''
That's all right.
We've already been warned.
Why won't we believe it?
Because what happened in Brigadoon was a miracle... and most folks do not believe in miracles.
''Miracles require faith, and faith seems to be as dead as--''
Mr. Forsythe?
Aye.
Now this miracle happened--
Let me see.
-What day is it?
-Friday.
Friday. That means it happened exactly 200 years ago.
Two hundred years ago the Highlands of Scotland were plagued with witches-- wicked sorcerers who were takin' the Scottish people... away from the teachings of God and puttin' the devil into their souls.
''They were indeed horrible, destructive women.''
-l do not suppose you have such women.
-Witches?
''Oh, we have 'em.
We pronounce it differently.'' lt did not matter that they were not real sorcerers... because you and l know there's no such thing... but their influence was very real indeed.
Now we had at that time in Brigadoon... an old minister of the kirk... named Mr. Forsythe... and a good man he was.
-The kindest man in Scotland.
-l believe he was.
No man loved his parish as did Mr. Forsythe...
''but he was gettin' old, and it grieved him that one day soon...'' he'd have to leave those he loved so well.
But most of all he worried about the witches.
''Now mind you, they hadn't visited us as yet in Brigadoon...'' but he knew that there was a band of them coming our way.
So he began to wonder whether there was not something he could do...
''to protect the folk of his parish, not only against them...'' but against all the evils that might come to Brigadoon... from the outside world after he died.
Then one day he came to me and told me... that he had decided to ask God for a miracle.
''And on an early Wednesday mornin', right after midnight...'' he went out to a hill beyond Brigadoon... and made his prayer to God.
''And there, in the hush of the sleeping world...'' he asked God that night to make Brigadoon... and all the people in it... vanish into the highland mist.
Vanish... but not for always.
They would return just as they were for one day... every hundred years.
The people would lead their customary lives... but every day when they awoke... it would be a hundred years later.
And when we awoke next day... it was a hundred years later.
''ln this way,
Mr. Forsythe figured that...'' there'd be no change in the lives of the people.
They just wouldn't be in any century long enough to be touched by it.
You mean that--
You mean that you go to bed at night...
''and when you wake up the next day, it's a hundred years later?''
Aye.
And every day is a hundred years later?
Aye.
What happened to the minister?
We ne'er saw him again.
''You see, he realized to ask for such a miracle...''
''some sacrifice would have to be made, and he wanted to be the one to make it.''
''Well, what was the greatest sacrifice that he could offer?'' lt was to be separated from those he loved before his time.
And that was why he went out to a hill beyond Brigadoon...
''where, his miracle granted...'' he'd ne'er see Brigadoon again.
All this happened
200 years ago?
''Aye, lad.''
''Which of course to us, you see, is only two days ago.''
Let me ask you something.
Suppose somebody around here got fed up and wanted to leave?
''-Then what?
-Well, he cannot leave.''
''-You mean, l've gotta stay here now?
-No, lad.''
But according to Mr. Forsythe's contract with God... if anyone belonging to Brigadoon leaves... the enchantment will be broken for all.
''And that night, when all the people go to sleep...''
Brigadoon will disappear forever.
''Look, l'm not saying l believe all this...'' butjust for argument's sake... suppose a stranger like--
''well, like me--'' came to Brigadoon and wanted to stay.
Could he?
''Aye, he could.
Mr. Forsythe provided for that.''
''He didn't miss a trick, did he?''
''No, lad, he did not.''
A stranger can stay if he loves someone here.
''Not Brigadoon itself, mind you, but someone in Brigadoon...'' enough to be willing to give up everything... to stay near that person.
''Which is only right, because after all, lad...'' if you love someone deeply enough... anything is possible.
Aye. Anything is possible.
''Oh, Fiona, shouldn't you be thinkin' of changin' for the weddin'?'' l had.
''Tommy, will l see ya later?'' l'll be there. l'd like to stick around... and see if this place evaporates like you say. l must hurry now.
''Good-bye, Mr. Lundie...'' and thank you.
She's a dear lassie.
''Yes, l'm finding that out.''
''Mr. Lundie, are you all perfectly happy living here in this little town?''
''Why, of course, lad.''
''After all, sunshine can peep through a wee hole.''
But what's it like at night when you go to sleep?
For me it's like being carried on shadowy arms... up to a distant cloud... and there l float 'til mornin'.
And yet... sometimes l think l hear strange voices.
-Voices?
-Aye.
They say no words that l can remember... and yet... they're voices filled with a fearful longin'.
And often they seem to call me back. l've pondered over it when l was awake... and l think... l have a feelin' l'm hearin' the outside world.
''Oh, there must be an awful lot of folk out there...'' searchin'... for a Brigadoon.
Buchanan!
Douglas!
Lindsey!
There's goin' to be a weddin'.
We have no minister in Brigadoon now.
''ln most villages, this would be a calamitous thing...'' but when there is no minister present...
''it is perfectly proper, according to the laws of Scotland...'' for two people to wed each other by sincere mutual consent.
There need be nothin' in writin'.
All that is necessary... is that ye promise to love each other... while ye both are on Earth.
''Go ahead, lad.'' l shall love ya 'til l die... and l'll make all effort to be a good husband to ya.
And so much will l try... to be a fine and lovin' wife.
''-Are we married now, Mr. Lundie?
-Aye, lad, you're married.''
''Go on, kiss her, lad.''
''Mr. Forsythe would have liked to have been here, l know...'' but as long as you're both good and true to one another... ya cannot fail but live in the grace of God... and Mr. Forsythe could've wished no more than that.
All l've done was to want ya too much. l'm leavin' Brigadoon!
'Tis the end of all of us!
The miracle is over!
''We must stop 'im! Cover the woods!
Sandy and Angus, guard the bridge!''
''Robert, take a group and spread out along the old kirk!''
''Fiona, is it true?
Could he make Brigadoon disappear?''
''Aye, if he gets away.''
Harry Beaton!
Harry Beaton!
Harry Beaton
Harry Beaton
Run and get him
Get him
Run and get him
Get him
Run ye men or ye will never see another mornin'
Go and stop him
Stop him

Harry Beaton!
Harry Beaton!
Beaton sure came this way
'' And we cannot be too far behind him, laddie''
'' Ye there, head for the brae''
'' Keep your eye open or ye will not find him, laddie'' l'll go down to the creek
'' And by God, if l see him l'll throw him in it''
Search the hill to the peak
'' Find him, lads or tomorrow will never, never come''
Run and get him

-How did it happen?
-He must've hit his head on a rock.
''Ah, the poor lad!''
''Oh, Harry, my son, my son.''
How could ya be so ungrateful?
''Oh, l'm so ashamed for ye.'' l'm so ashamed for ye.
''Look here, all of ya. There's been enough sorrow for one weddin' night.''
Don't tell anyone he's dead.
Just say he was stopped.
They can find out in the mornin'. l'll take him to my cottage.
No one will see him.
''-Father, what happened?
-lt's all right. The alarm is over.''
''-Was he hurt bad?
-No, just scratched a wee bit.''
He'll be fine and fit in the mornin'.
Now let's all come back to the weddin' supper.
''-Aren't ya comin', Fiona?
-Aye, Father.''
''Angus, did ya see
Tommy, the American?''
''Aye, dearie. l saw him cross the bridge.''
''Angus, did he come back?'' l did not see him.
They stopped him just in time.
He wasn't far from the brook.
''Yes, they told me.''
''Oh, Fiona, when l think what could have happened--''
''Your whole world, gone forever.'' l thought my world was gone. l thought you'd left.
Without saying good-bye to you?
You know l wouldn't do that. l know ya wouldn't have.
''Tommy, darlin'.'' l can't leave you. l can't.
Lundie said you could stay if you love someone enough... and l do. l love you. l'd better hurry and find him.
There's not much time.
-Are they after you now?
-l'm looking for Lundie. l've got something very important to tell you. l'm not going back with you. l'm gonna stay here.
''Oh, that's nice.''
''Please, Jeff, be serious, just for once.'' l am. l'm being serious all over the place.
''l tell ya, l feel more a part of her and all this...'' than l ever felt about Jane or anybody or anything back home.
-Great.
-l can't give it up. l belong here.
''Yeah, you belong here, all right.
No doubt about it.''
''Milking cows in the morning, planting little things...''
''weaving, butter churning.''
''That's for you, boy.
You'll have a ball.''
''And just think, you can do it for always, always...''
''in a town that's got one of the longest ''''always'''' on record.'' lt's got nothing to do with all these things you're talking about.
Don't you see? l believe in her.
''And what's more, l believe in this place, and l can't leave.''
''Well, kiddies, that's what happened to Tommy today.''
''But what about his friend, Jeff?
Well, he had fun too.''
Tonight he went running off through the woods after some Highland hothead... who was gonna make all the people disappear... by crossing the wrong street.
''Well, after a while
Jeff thought he saw a bird...''
''perched low in a tree, and he shot at it.''
Something fell to the ground.
''He rushed over to it, and what do you think it was?'' lt was Hothead Harry.
''Yes, sir, the boy dervish himself, lying there looking all dead.''
You mean you--
To kill somebody somewhere else in the world would have been an awful thing.
But Harry was a citizen of the little town that wasn't there... and he probably never lived in the first place.
''Chances are, there weren't even any woods.''
''ln fact, the whole day probably never even happened...''
''because, you see, this is a fairy tale.''
''Oh, Jeff, you poor guy.
You must feel horrible.''
''What do you mean, l must feel?''
What am l supposed to feel in a voodoo joint like this?
''Dream stuff, boy, all made up out of broomsticks and wishing wells.'' lt's that or a boot camp for lunatics. l don't know what goes on around here.
''All l know is that whatever it is, it's got nothing to do with me or you...'' and anything that happens to either of us just doesn't count!
How can it when you don't understand it?
''And you want to give up your family, your friends, your whole life for this?'' lt's not even worth arguing about.
Now go say good-bye to the little people and thank them for the picnic.
''You're confused, aren't you, boy?''
''You know, if you believed as much as you think you do, you wouldn't be.''
''Tommy, Fiona tells me you want to stay.'' l'll wait for you by the bridge.
''Tommy, what did he mean by that?''
What is it?
''Fiona, it's me. l thought--''
''Do not be ashamed of yourself, lad.'' lt's the hardest thing in the world to give everything... though it's usually the only way to get everything.
''You'd better hurry, Fiona.
There's not much time left.''
''Fiona, do you understand at all?''
-l think so.
-Then you're not sorry l came?
''No, l'm glad. l'll be less lonely now.''
Real loneliness is not bein' in love in vain... but not bein' in love at all.
-lf l only had more time.
-lt's not your fault.
'Tis the end of our day!
''-lt isn't because l don't love you.
-l know, l know.''
''But to stay, l had to have no fears and no doubts.''
''Aye, Tommy, aye.''
''Good-bye, Tommy...''
''and do not forget any day, any night...'' that always and always... l love you. l love you. l love you. l love you. l love you.
''Peter, Peter, l left the dogs in the car.''
Will you be a dear and ask the driver to take them home and feed them?
''l can't afford to get a divorce, what with community property and taxes.''
-But alimony is deductible.
-But she'll want capital. l can't give her that. lt isn't fair to the children.
''Darling, l'm so sorry l'm late, but l had the most agonizing afternoon.''
My new analyst is divine.
He has the most marvelous new theory.
He believes that childhood hasn't got anything to do with anything.
-Sounds dreamy.
-l've got my standards.
''l'll lie, cheat, steal for this company...'' but l will not give up my integrity. l feel that a man is of value to the organization as long as he--
''-Yes, it arrived this afternoon.
-Have Andre fix it for a party at 6:00.''
Tell him for me that if he messes up the sauce this time--
''Great little car.
Hiya, Jeff.''
Once you get into one of those foreign cars--
''But, honey, why don't you try and see my side of it?''
''Frank, bring me another brandy.''
''-lt's bourbon, sir.
-lt is?''
''That's all you've had for four months, ever since you got back from Scotland.'' ls that right? l just decided l don't like it. lt's not near as good as the whiskey
Mother used to make. l'll have brandy.
''-Yes, sir.
-Honey, l can't get home tonight.''
''l know, but l can't let the boss down.''
He's got this girl that he wants to take out... and he needs another man along so it won't look like she's with him.
''Yes, dear.''
''You'd better bring me two glasses of water, Frank.''
''l know, baby, but we can celebrate your birthday tomorrow night.''
''Honey, l can't take any longer. l've gotta get back. Talk to you later.''
Frank? Sorry.
''-Sorry.
-Would you like dinner, Mr. Douglas?''
-No. Bring me my lunch check.
-Certainly. l think l'll eat out tonight.
''-Frank, bring me another.
-So soon? Where's the last one?'' lt vanished... like Brigadoon.
''Like who, sir?''
That was the name of my brother who ran away.
''Good evening, Mr. Albright.
Your table will be ready in a moment.''
''-Thank you, Peter.
-Tommy, Tommy.''
What's your opinion about the Parker deal?
-l'll let you know tomorrow.
-l've got a real slant on it-- l'll tell you tomorrow. l'll give you a call.
''Albright, how about that meeting this morning? Was that great?''
-Great.
-Things were brought out in the open.
-Let in a lot of fresh air.
-Great.
-Do you like how l handled the old man?
-Great.
''Thanks, Albright.''
-Hi.
-Hi.
-lt's hot in here.
-lt's not the heat. lt's the humanity.
''-Good evening, Mr. Albright.
-Oh, thank you, Frank.''
-Have you seen Jane?
-She meeting you here?
-Yeah.
-l'll drink up and get outta here.
There's nothing a woman hates more than her fiancé's best friend.
He knows the secrets she's gonna spend the rest of her life tryin' to find out.
-l've been dodging her for a month now.
-Don't worry about it.
''l always say, scratch the surface of any woman and she'll enjoy it.''
-When are you getting married?
-l don't know.
-l don't know if l want to get married.
-Why?
''Because, old tank, l'm in love with someone else...''
''and l ''''canna'''' get over it.''
''And the trouble is, because l can't be with her, l can't be with anyone.''
So many things remind me of her.
''l'll be talking with people, and they might say one little word...''
''that opens the door to a memory for me, and then...''
''l'm a few thousand miles away with-- well, you know.''
''But slowly l come back to the conversation, they ask me a question...'' and l don't know what in the world they've been talking about.
-l haven't heard a word.
-You must be fascinating company. lt ain't easy.
''-Hello, Jane!
-Hello, Jane!''
''-You've certainly been elusive.
-Hello, Jeff.'' l've been up to my neck at the office.
Would you like a drink?
''Love one. An old-fashioned, please, and would you bring it to the table?''
''-How are you, Jeff?
-Darling, it's been weeks.''
''-Fine, Jane. How are you?
-l'm sorry.''
''Oh, l've had a little cold, but other than that--''
-But you could've called more often.
-l hate to eat and run.
''-Your table is ready, Mr. Albright.
-Thank you.''
-l'll call you later.
-Hello!
''Good-bye!
Frank, put it on the bill.''
''-Your bill, sir, is very high.
-So am l!''
''-Jane, you look fine.
-So do you.''
''-Would you care to order dinner now?
-No, we'll finish our drinks first.''
''Darling, l wish you'd been with me over the weekend.''
''l went up to Connecticut, house hunting.
Saw the most wonderful place.''
''Rather interesting. Colonial, and right on top of a beautiful hill.''
Through the heather
On the hill
The mornin' dew ls blinkin' yonder
There's lazy music
On the rill
And all l want to do is wander
Through the heather--
''And l didn't think you'd want to do that, would you?''
''Hmm? Uh, maybe.''
''You mean, you'd even consider it?''
What?
Commuting from
60 miles out of New York.
''-No, l wouldn't wanna do that.
-l didn't think so.''
And l told Mr. Bradville.
-Who?
-Herbert Bradville.
''-Who's he?
-Darling, he's the real estate man...'' l just told you l've been working with.
''l told him you'd call, so please do. l'm trying hard to arrange everything.''
''By the way, do you still want
Jeff to stand up for you?''
''Yes, if he can.''
Why?
Nothing. lt's just he's so impossible these days.
Everybody's bored to death with him.
''Maybe l'm not interested in everybody, Jane.''
''Well, you certainly have been antisocial since you got back from Scotland.'' l thought for a while there was something really bothering you.
You certainly wouldn't keep me waiting and--
Waitin' for my dearie
And happy am l
To hold my heart
'Til he comes strollin' by
''-Give me a ring, won't you?
-Oh, of course.''
'' When he comes, my dearie''
One look and l'll know
That he's the dearie l've been wantin' so
''-When l see you wander around like--
-No, Jane. No.''
-No what?
-There won't be a wedding next month.
''-Do you mean you're postponing it again?
-No, Jane, l'm not postponing it.''
-l'm calling it off for good.
-Calling it off?
''Jane, l'm sorry.
You've been wonderful, darling.''
''lt's not your fault, but something strange happened to me a few months ago.''
''l can't explain it, but l just don't fit here anymore.''
You've gone clean out of your mind.
We can't stand here and talk about it.
Let's go home and--
''Go home, go home
Go home with bonnie Jean''
'' Go home, go home''
''lf you want to stay and make a fool of yourself, you can.'' l'll go home with bonnie Jean
'' Go home, go home
Go home with bonnie Jean''
Until l'm old enough for Social Security... l've got my expense account.
''But most important of all, l'm building.''
Building every day. That's about the only security a man can have.
''Hello. Room 732, please.''
''Jeff, are you sober?
Listen to me.'' l wanna go back to Scotland.
You wanna come along?
Never mind what for!
Do you wanna come with me?
''Okay, get plane reservations right away.''
''l know it isn't there, but l wanna see where it was!''
''Who cares if it doesn't make sense?
Jeff, l wanna go!'' l've got to! lt's unbelievable.
-Awful and unbelievable.
-What is?
''To think that down there, somewhere between the mist and the stars...''
''there's someone l want so terribly, and l know she's not dead.''
''She's only asleep, and yet l'll never see her again.''
''Well, you didn't have to come all the way over here just to say that.''
You could've told me on the phone back in New York for a dime.
''No, l'll tell you why.''
She became so alive to me that l had to come back and see for myself... if the place really wasn't here. lt didn't work that way for me. lt's so much like a dream now that l have to work hard... to convince myself it happened at all.
''There's the big difference between us, Jeff.''
''Oh, tell me about it.'' l found that... sometimes the things you believe in become more real to you... than all the things you can explain away or understand.
''Oh, why do people have to lose things...'' to find out what they really mean?
''Well, let's start walkin'.'' l got lost around here once.
Brigadoon
Brigadoon
Blooming under
Sable skies
Brigadoon
Brigadoon
There my heart forever
Lies
Let the world grow cold
Around us
Let the heavens
Cry above
Tommy!
''Tommy, lad, you!''
''My, my, you must really love her.
You woke me up.''
''Come, lad.''
You shouldn't be too surprised.
''l told ya, if ya loved someone deeply enough...'' anything is possible.
Even miracles.
Brigadoon
Brigadoon ln my valley
There'll be
Love
There'll be love

Suomi-Filmi presents
Based on the themes of Kalevala
Made as a Mosfilm and
Suomi-Filmi co-production in 1959
This film is dedicated to the memory - of Elias Lönnrot, the collector of Karelian folklore.
Mastered by desire impulsive, by a mighty inward urging,
I am ready now for singing, ready to begin the chanting
Golden friend, and dearest brother, brother dear of mine in childhood,
Let us clasp our hands together fingers intertwined with fingers
Come and sing with me the stories, come and chant with me the legends.
You did your chores, Lemminkäinen.
Go on home now.
Hello!
Hello!
Mother!
Darling Goldilocks!
Ilmarinen!
Annikki, dear sister.
What is on your mind?
The eyes as blue as the sea.
Canst thou forge for us the Sampo, hammer us the lid in colours?
On one side to grind the flour, on another to make the salt.
We would never go hungry if we had the Sampo.
Cannot forge for thee the Sampo without heavenly fire.
Fire from the nave of the sky.
Where has the spark gone, the one given to us by thunder?
Louhi took the spark to the stony hills of Northland.
Sampo! Sampo!
Sampo!
Sampo!
Sampo! Sampo! Sampo!
Have you already forged the Sampo?
Hammered me the lid in colours?
You'll never have the wisdom to forge such things!
We tried with all our might!
Throw this jester into the pit with vipers and snakes!
Have mercy, my dear lady!
There is one who can forge it, hammer you the lid in colours!
- Who is it?
- It is Ilmarinen the blacksmith, the ancient forging master.
On the plains of Kalevala.
He, the one that forged the heavens, forged the air a hollow cover.
Listen, wizard.
Bring this Ilmarinen to me, so that I can have a look at him.
Rise up, blacksmith.
Come to the banks of Northland.
Rise up, blacksmith.
Come to the banks of Northland.
Rise up, come here!
Come here!
Annikki, dear sister.
The sister of Ilmarinen, the most crafty forging master.
We are bound to get the Sampo.
Fly, fly, my cloak.
Cross the sea like a storm.
Hello, sun, to your pretty face for rising up so beautifully
From under the ground and way up above the trees
Make your way safe and sound, travel without harm
End your journey beautifully and pleasantly come the evening
End your journey beautifully and pleasantly come the evening
Annikki!
Annikki!
Annikki!
Fly, fly, Goldilocks, to the courtyards of Kalevala.
Thereto take my message.
Bitter in this place of ruin.
Thus will I, chick, disappear
Thus will I, fair maiden, perish
Within a hill of copper
Imprisoned in a cave by Louhi
This is the last thing you'll do, and it will be the end of you!
Ilmarinen! Your graceful sister is in the darkness of Northland.
Annikki.
Give me your sword so I can rescue the maiden.
Bide a while, Lemminkäinen.
I shall accompany you.
Hear this, old Väinämöinen.
The evil lady of Northland has just captured Annikki.
Where can I get a vessel so we can sail there?
It is a vast, open sea to sail.
A long way to travel.
Be that as it may,
I will hastily give you a vessel which will glide on the surging waves like a swan.
Help us, old Väinämöinen!
Here is an oak to work on, a wonderful tree to build a boat.
It will take us to Northland to aid dear Annikki in distress.
- Who on earth are you?
- We are the winds.
The winds?
- I came from the west.
- I am a great summer's wind.
- From the far north-east.
- I stood still as a thick fog.
Fog?
I blew from the farthest North, freezing everything on my way.
Who is this talking?
I am Frost, son of gale, bringer of cold weather.
Please release me from these chains, untie my cumbersome restraints.
So, Annikki dear,
I will give you chores, some work to do to pass your time, make your day fly by with haste.
May the sun shine onto you.
Glide upon the trackless waters, sail away, my ship of magic
Sail without the touch of hand without an oar to propel thee
Caress the vessel, dear wind
Guide it across the wide blue sea
Bring the men to Northland, then
Brave young souls to the coldness there
Come out, you seers!
Down from the cliffs, wizards!
Whose is this boat approaching us through the waves?
Milady!
One is Lemminkäinen and the other
Ilmarinen the blacksmith!
Greetings to you!
Thank you for your welcome!
Is there space for us to draw our ship ashore?
Dry land to rest it on?
Ground for us to fight on?
Yard enough for us to battle?
- I suppose we have room for you.
Places for throat-cutting.
To kill such a scoundrel, slay a no-good man.
What are you babbling about, vile woman?
Give Annikki back to us.
Let the poor thing board the boat.
I will not give her to you.
Let this arrow fly toward you, split the spleen of this evil woman!
Hold on, Lemminkäinen.
What will you give me as ransom for the young maiden?
What are you asking for?
If you plough my field full of vipers!
I shall do it!
Take me to the field.
Give to me your plough.
Bring forth a horse to pull it.
I shall not give to you my plough, nor my horse to the mouth of vipers.
I will make you a pleasing plough and harness a good horse, too.
Milady!
Soon Lemminkäinen will be ploughing the field of vipers.
He will take the girl back.
Poor men will be left without a vessel.
Boatless, our dear guests.
I have ploughed your field of vipers.
May it grow viperless from this day forth.
Bring forth our Annikki!
I shall give her to you.
But how will you take her to sea?
A pike splashed around here with its mighty tail.
He whipped your boat to pieces, snapped the arcs into bits.
I will make a new vessel.
Replace it with an iron one.
So the giant pike may bite away and break his teeth while trying.
A boat is emerging from the fire, a boat is emerging!
If you are asking for a ride to the underworld, there is your vessel.
- Banish the horrid ship!
Now give Annikki back to us.
- Your maiden is not ready.
- Damn you and your lies.
You ploughed the field, but you will not get your sister without more serious chores.
Well, what do you ask of me?
Forge a Sampo on our rock, hammer us the lid in colours.
Listen, Lady of the North.
I'll make you tools.
If you won't forge me the Sampo, you will not get your sister alive.
- Listen, Lady of the North.
- Hammer me the lid in colours!
Wilt thou forge the Sampo?
I guess I will forge the Sampo.
Like I once forged the sky.
We will take Annikki back.
Bring her home with us.
- Well?
- From the tips of white-swan feathers, from the finest wool of lambkins, from a single grain of barley.
These will make the Sampo.
From the tips of white-swan feathers.
From the finest wool of lambkins.
From a single grain of barley.
These will make the Sampo.
Sampo! Sampo!
Sampo.
Give me fire for my furnace from the nave of the sky!
The nave of the sky?
The ground must be ploughed to grow, fishnets thrown in water to feed one.
Sampo cannot be made without fire.
He wants the enchanted flame.
Then we'll have our Sampo, with a beautiful lid in colours!
- On one side to grind the flour.
- On another to make the salt.
A moneymaker on the third!
Get the wizards to labour.
Make them work the bellows.
Inflame the inflamers!
Will the Sampo be ready soon?
Make everyone labour, work the bellows more mightily!
Inflame the inflamers!
Work the bellows!
Water!
Bring water hither!
Sampo.
Sampo!
Sampo...
Well? Now, woman, give me my Annikki.
Did our new Sampo work its lid in colours?
Thus let the Sampo be born.
May it work its lid in colours.
- Where is my sister?
- You can have the girl.
- Annikki.
- Lemminkäinen.
Annikki.
Dear sister.
Leave this place, you dogs!
Finally the duckling is under my wing, my favourite bird by my side.
I will never give up my darling, never forget my dear maiden.
What did you give for me?
Miserable, little me?
Your brother, he forged a Sampo for your ransom.
He gave Northland the Sampo?
There goes the fortune of our people, just to release poor little me.
Annikki, my sister.
When we reach our destination and arrive back home,
I'll go and retrieve the Sampo.
It is about time that I, too, did some manly chores.
- Don't!
- Lemminkäinen!
Welcome back, dear friend!
Please stay for the week!
Be welcomed to our courtyard.
Could you be man enough to drink this beer I offer?
Now listen, you heathen!
Dirty scoundrel!
Why did you come back?
You know why!
I came back to get the Sampo, retrieve the lid in colours.
I'll take the Sampo back to the plains of Kalevala.
If you won't settle for less, take what you came for.
Go!
Well? Go!
If you are up to the task.
Why do you put your swords down and go in weaponless?
A sword would taint the Sampo.
A blade would blemish the lid in colours.
Sampo.
That is the end of Lemminkäinen.
The demise of your poor son.
That is a flagrant lie!
Easy now, Annikki.
Soon you'll be a beautiful bride, dancing your wedding for a week.
Oh birch, you white-belted one.
Did you not see my son?
I have enough care already, pitiful my own misfortunes.
My belt is cut with knives, the leaves stripped from my head.
Oh pathway, you finest of sands.
Did you not see my son?
I have enough care already, pitiful my own misfortunes.
They trample me with war-horses, wear me out with iron hooves.
Oh sun, you golden spindle.
Did you not see my son?
Your son is in the distance.
In the darkness of Northland.
Who arrives uninvited, comes without company?
Where is my poor son?
I know not about your son, or where he might have gone.
He might have been eaten by wolves or gnawed up by bears.
I know you are lying.
Wolves can't touch my kin!
He puts them down with bare hands.
Battles bears without weapons.
Where have you put my son?
Ask the fish in the sea, the perch deep beneath the waves.
Sea.
Give up my son.
Push him back ashore.
Get up, my son.
Rise up from your dreaming.
Golden apple of my eye, my silver staff to lean on.
What good is a dead man?
What use a drowned steed?
Oh pathway, you misfortunate one.
Please, save my son.
The ground is never alone, roads never emerge unaided.
Use them to save your son.
Of birch, you misfortunate one.
Please, save my son.
I will spill a drop for thee, sap from underneath my bark, a tiny drip of tree nectar.
Take it from my belt.
Use it to save your son.
Oh sun, you golden spindle, shine between the clouds.
Please, save my son.
Mother.
Son.
I thank thee, birch.
Pathway, I thank thee more still.
Oh sun, you golden spindle.
I thank thee most of all.
Mother, my resurrector.
You awaited a week.
Wait a while longer.
Then I'll be back.
- Where are you going, my only one?
- I have to retrieve the Sampo.
Sampo!
I won't come back from Northland and face Annikki without carrying the lid in colours.
The day will not save you again, the sun give you another life.
Sampo must be brought home, and its gifts where they belong.
Thou shalt not come here!
So, you help yourself?
Tie him to the rock!
Where did this fog come from?
Go, whence you came!
Puffing without permission, you.
Poor me, look at this!
Who has done this deed?
Lemminkäinen.
He who retrieves the Sampo, brings back the lid in colours, shall have a helmet full of gold, a blanket filled with silver.
Sampo!
Rise, you wind, and blow!
Do away with young Lemminkäinen!
The steed sank into the sea, drowned beneath the waves.
Gone is now my poor man
My Goldilocks disappeared
Beneath the waves so deep
Into the blackness deep below
The waters took my dearest one
Do not ever in a million years
Draw your nets for fish in this vast bay of our sea
And my mother my forebearer
May she never in a million years
Get the water for her kettle from this well so evil...
Lemminkäinen!
Oh, Lemminkäinen.
My Son!
The worry of my kin guarded me.
Long as I was sleeping.
The Sampo sank into the deep.
So little is left of it.
A piece of the heart of Sampo.
Don't you worry, Lemminkäinen.
Just let the days pass.
There will be use for it yet, the last morsel of Sampo.
Within it lies the seed and beginning of eternal happiness.
May Kalevala emerge here on the banks of Northland!
May Kalevala emerge here on the banks of Northland!
Lemminkäinen is alive.
The scoundrel cheated death.
I will use my cloak and fly to Kalevala!
- The groom got a fine maiden.
- Like the other pea in the pod.
- Like a strawberry in the field.
- A small bird in a tree.
Fine feathers up a birch tree, white breast on a maple branch.
A pretty grass on a lawn, a golden flower in a meadow.
Rise up from the oars, bluebill, ascend from the paddles, dear duck
Rise up without lifting, ascend without elevating
Advance along this reckless road, the ground prepared for you
The carefully groomed courtyards, evened out especially
Put your foot up on the step, then proceed to move indoors
Under the handsome ridgepole, this beautiful canopy!
Rise up from the oars, bluebill, ascend from the paddles, dear duck
Rise up without lifting, ascend without elevating
Greetings and God bless you, everyone under this ridgepole.
Under this beautiful canopy.
Greetings to you, and welcome to our home!
This humble house of ours, this petty room of pinewood.
A fine ale, tasty drink, malty beverage to my liking.
A man should not drink in vain, he should sing, too.
Oh, wise Väinämöinen, ancient and famous singer.
Please pick up your instrument, play us your harp.
Groom, be thankful for your fortune for this good woman you have met
Your maker promised you a good one gave you one in all his grace, too
This duckling is pretty at sea, yet even prettier by your side
A star shines brightly in the sky yet more brightly on your finger
Please give us, dear God another day; oh Lord
For us to live here in peace and keep working our good deeds
I wish we could play all day and be merry in the evening in this stead we call our own
In Kalevala and its courtyards
Eternal night has come, a lasting period of darkness.
- Our feast was abruptly ended.
- Let the banquet continue later.
This is a serious matter.
Let us go and see.
Oh, poor me.
There is no joy under the sky, no reason to play the harp, with no daylight to be had, no sunlight shining on our heads.
I shall make the winds blow, make a tempest rage in turmoil!
Freeze the marshes, freeze the lands!
Cover the canopies with snow, knock down the people of Kalevala!
Slay them and their devious kin.
No more shall our swan be singing to poor people ridden with frost.
Death will soon come, our demise is approaching.
We will all freeze to death here.
Light up the room for a moment, dear candle.
So that I may take one more look at you and your pretty eyes.
Are they blue or red?
Or white as a sheet?
- Get up, Ilmarinen!
- There is no life without the sun.
Forge us another day up there to the top of the sky.
You have forged the heavens, too!
I think I might forge the day.
- What are you forging in your smithy?
- A new halo for the sun.
Day cannot be made in a smithy.
Let us go to Northland and release the day once more.
Rise up with your swords, men!
Everyone to your blades!
A sword cannot touch the evil, a blade violate the villains.
Something else is needed.
The magic of marvellous music.
We shall go with harps in our hands.
How do we implement the instruments?
Construct the harps?
There are plenty of pines standing on our hills.
Strike the wood with your axes, carve it with your hatchets.
Bring all the ships here.
Gather our wooden vessels.
Bring all your gold here.
All you shining silver, too.
That will make the strings for our harps to make sounds of eternal joy.
The piece of Sampo's heart, fly to the top of the sky.
Move like an arrow of blue, twinkle like a spark of fire.
Come and see this, wizards.
What is this strange phenomenon?
- It is the swordsmen of Kalevala.
They shall come in hundreds, thousands even.
What are they holding in their hands?
Harps, I reckon?
They come here to dance, in need of a jolly frolic.
Death to the intruders!
May demise meet the haughty steeds in the freezing embrace of the lake.
In the frosty womb of the snow.
Put your hands on your ears, so you cannot hear the strange music.
Strike them all down!
With steel-tip arrows and spears of copper.
Rise up, you wind!
Turn into a terrible tempest!
Turn into a terrible tempest.
Fly, fly, my cloak!
Hurtle away, dear cloth!
Strangle these men by their throats!
Now, Lemminkäinen.
Release the daylight from the rock!
Soon you will rise again, sun!
Beautiful day rise from the rock!
Greetings, day; for shining so bright, dear sun for rising so high.
Give us happiness henceforth, to live life in peace and harmony.
In this stead we call our own, on the plains of Kalevala.

Saga Vera Oy, Oulu
Extracts from Kalevala translation from 1888 by John Martin Crawford
Sorry, Miss Jan.
Sam, l'd think by now, you'd know every hole in this road.
I know all the holes, Miss Jan, but on this road there's no place to go but in them.
Well, it's a good thing
Africa hasn't completely changed.
I was afraid after 10 years you'd be driving me home on a super-highway with drive-ins on both sides.
Nothing much has changed in this part of Africa, Miss Jan, not in 10 years, not in 50 years.
Sam!
Sam! Stop, you hit a man!
It wasn't a man. It was one of them. l'm truly sorry, Miss Jan, but l couldn't stop.
There's your grandma, now.
She'll tell you l was right.
She's waiting for you.
You're trembling.
We hit a man.
Ran over him not a mile down the road.
Sam wouldn't stop. l saw him, ma'am, with the seaweed on him.
He stood in the middle of the road and tried to stop the car.
Get Miss Jan's things up to her room.
But that man. He's badly hurt, or dead.
There's no one on the road.
Remember that! l saw him! Sam saw him! He admits it.
Go inside now, and freshen up, Jan.
So you still believe in this voodoo? l thought it was a nightmare from my childhood. l thought everything would be different now.
Later on, Jan, you'll decide for yourself. l'm sorry it had to start like this on your first night back.
Here's to a calm crossing, which we already had!
The hook dragged anchor at 18 fathoms.
Okay. Okay. Lower the launch.
Okay, sir.
No, l don't want any more, thanks.
And here's to a million bucks in diamonds, which we're soon going to have.
You're getting drunk.
Why not? ln a few days, l'm going to deck that lovely beautiful body of yours with diamonds from head to toe.
Now what would l do with diamonds on my toes?
Never mind. lt was a sweet thought.
And what are you going to do with your diamonds, Jeff?
Me? l'm going to stuff mine in a nice little box l rent at the First National Bank in New York.
Oh, now that's real romantic.
You're listing to port, Mona.
Your husband's the man over there.
Can't you take a friendly little kiss without trying to make something out of it?
How about me, Mona?
Don't l get a kiss, too?
You don't get a cut of the diamonds, Doctor.
Well, if l had known what went with them l would have insisted on a share.
Well, listen to the old boy! A regular Romeo.
The launch is ready, sir.
Who's that?
Help!
-l hit it. Both shots.
-Fool! l tell you, l hit him, whoever it was.
-Both times.
-More likely you hit Johnson.
What?
He's dead. l couldn't have hit him. l'm not that drunk. l don't think you did. His neck's broken.
Well, who did it? Who was that?
Get the others. Let's get him to shore.
Who was it?
You wouldn't believe me, Jan.
You didn't learn such things at school. l thought it was a man. l saw him walk right into the water. l came down to watch the ship arrive. l didn't expect them so soon.
But after what happened to you on the road l knew they'd be here tonight.
Mrs. Peters? l'm Doctor Eggert. l've been expecting you.
This is my great-granddaughter, Jan Peters.
How do you do, Miss Peters?
This is George Harrison. Mrs. Harrison.
And this is our diver, Jeff Clark.
-One of my men has just been murdered.
-l know. l heard the voices and the shots.
What's going on? l wrote. l warned you of the danger.
You mean that voodoo stuff? lt was a man. l fired at him.
And you hit him. But it didn't help, did it? l want the police.
The police will do you no good,
Mr. Harrison. They're far away.
We'll have to bury the poor man.
-Tonight?
-Well, he's dead.
We may as well bury him. lf the police want to dig him up later that's their business.
There's no casket but l'll get someone to sew him up in sailcloth.
These are the graves of the first group that came after the diamonds.
That was in 1906.
They were British.
This was a German expedition in 191 4 just before the outbreak of war.
What l want to know is, how did they all die, Mrs. Peters?
Another British group tried their luck in 1923.
Portuguese in 1928.
The first Americans showed up
10 years later, 1938.
Yours is the sixth attempt to recover the diamonds.
Whose graves are these?
The first one is for your dead sailor.
The others for the rest of us.
She's trying to scare us.
She wants the jewels for herself. l've learned that no one who comes for the diamonds can be frightened away.
Give me a hand.
That grave, it's for me! l know it. Get me away! Please.
-l'll get her to bed.
-Let them have the large guest room.
According to Eggert, the Susan B is lying in about 100 feet of water on a sandbar.
-Say, where is Eggert?
-He's having a pow-wow with the old lady.
Maybe he can find out why the old lady was so anxious to have those graves dug in advance.
Now, if the sandbar hasn't moved, it should be about here.
Well, this one baffles me. lt's pre-Christian, of course, but it doesn't seem to be truly African.
You know, it's closer to those figures on Easter lsland than anything l've seen.
You've picked the prize of the collection quick enough. l guess you do know something about Africa.
Just who are those people you're with?
Well, as l wrote you, l've spent 20 years researching the legends of the Susan B.
Mr. Harrison owns the salvage ship.
He came for the diamonds. l came for the story. l think l'd die happy if l could complete the research on my book.
Not that l'm eager to occupy one of those graves.
Only fools are afraid of the grave.
There are worse things.
Bodies around here must be buried quickly, Dr. Eggert.
-You mean, the climate?
-No! l don't like to explain to idiots who think l'm in my dotage.
But, you should understand.
The walking dead?
You believe in them?
And so will you, before the week is out.
My husband,
Captain Jeremy Peters of the Susan B.
He was one of them.
That picture was made over 60 years ago.
He looks almost the same today, except for the eyes. l've seen him.
You know the story.
The Susan B put in here for trade in 1894.
The sailors discovered a temple with a golden casque full of uncut diamonds.
They stole the casque. There was a fight.
And 10 of the sailors were presumed dead, the Captain among them.
The others returned to the ship with the casque.
Then, surprisingly, the 10 missing men appeared.
Something happened.
The rest of the crew were slaughtered and the ship scuttled in the bay.
You think that these 10 men that had been killed returned to their ship?
They were dead then and they're dead now.
But, they're still guarding those cursed diamonds.
One of them killed your sailor tonight.
They've killed everyone who's come for the diamonds.
But they're murderers! Your own husband...
They're dead, l tell you!
They have no morality, no free will.
They'll kill anyone who tries to steal the diamonds.
But what about you?
They don't bother me. They seem to know l don't want their precious treasure. lt was more than 50 years ago that l heard rumors that my husband was seen around here.
And l came back to find out.
Slowly, l pieced the story together. l built this house.
You want to be with your husband, this dead man? l came to help him return to dust, to find his eternal rest.
But how? How can you do that?
Oh, that fool woman, again!
Jan!
Fire!
That's the only way to fight them. lf you'll listen to me l'll help you get the diamonds.
Where'd he go?
You'll never find him.
Well, l'm clearing out.
Diamonds or no diamonds, l'm getting out of here.
-You're staying.
-George, you saw that thing! l came here for the diamonds. l'm staying and so are the rest of you.
But if you knew there'd be all this trouble, people killed, why did you let them come? l didn't let them do anything.
Eggert wrote and told me they were coming.
-l don't own the diamonds or the bay.
-But you wanted them to come.
Yes! l want them to find the diamonds and then destroy them!
Only when the diamonds are destroyed will your grandfather be able to rest.
Destroy them?
Do you think Harrison is the kind of man who would destroy the diamonds after going to all the trouble of finding them?
Throw them away because of an old wives' tale about men who died 60 years ago but aren't dead? lf they ever find the diamonds they'll be glad to destroy them. l know what l have to do!
And this time, there'll be an end to the diamonds, and an end to the walking dead.
Hello.
Weren't you afraid it was a zombie out here? l understand they don't smoke.
They're afraid of fire.
-Then you know all about them, too?
-Only what my grandmother says.
-And you believe her?
-No.
Then who broke into the house tonight?
Who killed Johnson? l wish l knew. l wanted to ask you to leave, with the others.
Give it up before any more are killed.
-Do l look like l'm afraid of zombies?
-But Johnson is dead, and so are many others buried behind the house. lt's not worth the risk.
Oh, yes, it is. lf those diamonds are half of what they're cracked up to be, my share may come to a million dollars.
-That's a lot of loot.
-What is it worth if you're dead?
Oh, look, Miss Peters, l may be a dumb diver, but l got A in Arithmetic at P.S. 81 .
That's in New York.
And this is the way it figures.
Usually, as a diver, l make 100 bucks a day.
And if l'm lucky l work three days out of every week.
That's 15 grand a year.
Now, do you know how many years l'd have to work to make a million?
Sixty-seven years.
You'd better go back to school and learn how much 60 years of life is worth, or 50, or 20, or even 10.
All right, l'll make you a promise. lf l get that million, or even half, l'll give up my dangerous occupation. l'll never dive into anything deeper than a swimming pool.
Or, if that makes you nervous, l'll stick to very dry martinis.
Not funny? l didn't think you'd listen.
There's something else.
Tonight, when Sam was driving me home we hit one of those men, not a mile down the road.
We hit him hard, ran over him.
We must have killed him. l'd like to find out.
So would l.
Can we get the car?
They're supposed to be afraid of flares.
Even if l agree with you and wanted to quit, it's not my show. lt's Harrison's equipment and Harrison's money.
That's why he waltzes off with three-quarters of whatever we find.
Right there, just ahead. l think l see something.
-lt was right over there.
-Be careful.
Looks like water. lt sure isn't blood.
-This where it happened?
-Just about here.
-Maybe a bit down the road.
-Let's look.
The remains of your headlamp.
You must have hit something right here.
-What is it?
-Seaweed.
Water and seaweed?
Do you suppose he could have come from the bay?
He just suddenly appeared on the road.
Footprints!
Facing toward the road.
So, he did come from the direction of the bay.
He must have been hit back there where we found the glass and the button.
He was thrown a few yards and run over down there.
Let's go back and see what we can pick up back there.
Jan, you take one side of the road, and l'll take the other.
See if you can find some more footprints.
Jeff!
He just picked himself up and walked away. l'd like to follow these.
-Tonight?
-No. l'll get something to mark the place.
We'll come back with the others in the morning.
Jan, can you hear me?
Try to get away while l back them down with these flares.
Jan, come on, we've got to move!
That should hold them.
Lucky you brought that Very gun along.
What made you think of it? l remembered how that old lady drove off that joker last night with the torch. l didn't know where the girl was taking me. l figured she was leading me in for a setup.
So, l grabbed the Very gun from the locker.
You say this mausoleum in the middle of the jungle is about 40 by 20 feet.
And no running water or central heating. lf you like, we'll pack a picnic lunch and walk over there.
Do you think you could find it again?
Well, l should.
You kept me up all night making notes.
You know, doc, you're going to have to cut me in on the royalties from your book. l think you're right the first time. l'll give you odds, Little Miss Sweetness and Light was leading you into a trap.
You can bet that she and that old witch are at the bottom of what's going on.
-Good morning.
-Good morning.
Warm milk, Margaret. l want to thank you for saving Jan's life, Mr. Clark.
She's very precious to me and l'll be always grateful.
Now, you've got a friend for life, Jeff.
We all die in good time, Mrs. Harrison.
There's a grave waiting for all of us.
You old hag! You're dead already. You just don't have sense enough to lie down.
-Shut up!
-Well, it's true.
She's at the bottom of what's going on around here, and you all know it. l'm sorry, Mrs. Peters, but, you see, she learned her manners as a hostess in Eddy's Front Street Saloon.
-She...
-As l was saying, l'm grateful, and l'll do whatever l can to help you recover the diamonds.
Thanks, but it won't make any difference now.
-You see, l've decided to give it up.
-What? You can't quit like this. l practically taught you the business.
You should have taught me the business end of the business.
Then, l'd be up on deck taking a sun bath and getting 75 percent, while you went below and played footsies with the fishes.
We made a deal. l've sunk $30,000 into this, practically everything l've got.
Get yourself another boy.
Do the diving yourself.
Nobody told me there'd be a crew of cut-throats pushing up the odds.
And l don't care who's behind them.
Okay. l'll give you another five percent.
Maybe he's right, George.
We ought to quit.
This place gives me the creeps.
-One more word out of you, and l'll...
-What'll you do? Put me in irons?
What do you want? l did some arithmetic last night, Harrison.
You know, 50 percent isn't hard to resist.
-l hope you live to collect it.
-Oh, but l intend to.
You see, l'm counting on you to keep me alive, at least, until after we get the diamonds.
We're losing the whole morning.
-Good morning.
-Good morning.
Good morning, Miss Peters.
-You all right?
-So, you're going ahead?
Yeah. Harrison talked me into it.
Ask Mrs. Peters.
But l tell you, l buried that knife in his throat.
-So, you missed a vital spot.
-Okay.
But l should have got a little blood out of that eight-inch blade.
Do you believe in the walking dead, Doctor Eggert?
All l know is what l've read.
What does it say in the books, Doc?
Are they supposed to be good swimmers?
Well, they wouldn't have to breathe.
Well, that's my weakness. l have to breathe.
Try to remember that, Harrison.
-Any last words?
-Just find the diamonds. l'm only going to try and locate the cabin.
Fifteen minutes.
Don't get yourself killed, Jeff. lt would be such a waste.
Can you hear me?
Telephone okay?
Air pressure okay?
All right, let's go.
...twenty-four, twenty-five.
Twenty-five feet. How is it?
Water's clear.
But I don't see anything yet.
This ''A-number one'' helmet
of yours is leaking, front port gasket.
Where'd you get it? In the surplus store?
-Is it bad?
-Not yet. Keep it coming.
Fifty feet.
Get the other suit ready.
Seventy-five feet. How's the leak?
No worse.
-Do you want to come up?
-No. Not yet.
Lower away.
I see something! Right under me.
Easy.
I'm looking right into the hold.
We're in luck.
I think I can walk right into the hold.
Maybe I can get in right now.
You want to try?
Yes. lt's no dive at all. lt's less than 100 feet.
But why go down? You're not in condition. l'm not going to let him get his hands on those diamonds without me being there.
I see it! I see the safe!
Start hoisting.
Jeff, can you hear me?
Are you inside?
-Jeff!
-What's happened?
Air pressure reads zero. ls he free? Can you haul him in?
-He seems to be coming up, unless...
-Unless what?
Unless the cable snapped.
Well, why don't you go down and see?
Well, this is the quickest way.
Keep them rolling.
He's alive.
We'd better try to get him to a doctor.
The nearest doctor is at the Angel Mission.
That's five hours driving each way. l do the doctoring around here.
Over my dead body.
Well, it's his breathing. lf we don't do something to help that quick, he may not come out of it. l'll fix something for him.
You're not gonna let her feed him anything, are you?
Well, what do you think?
-Well, l don't think she's a murderess, but...
-She's out of her head! l don't know if he's breathing at all now.
This will stimulate his breathing.
Give him about an ounce every hour.
Well, it's not that we distrust you,
Mrs. Peters, but...
Put it down.
Give it to him or not, as you please.
Wait! lt's potent, but it won't hurt you. l'll let you know if there's any change.
Okay, Florence Nightingale.
Call me when you're ready to go off shift.
Hit me. l just can't stand the excitement.
Exotic Africa.
Wild animals and tropical nights.
Here l am teaching a professor how to play blackjack. l have 21 .
Well, okay. So he owes you another thousand matchsticks.
Relax.
Well, why doesn't she tell us what's going on?
She just told you a half an hour ago.
He's sleeping peacefully and breathing normally.
What do you want, a bulletin every 10 minutes?
-Well, l'm going to see for myself.
-Don't start any trouble.
-How do you feel?
-No. No, don't stop. l guess l finally made it.
Soft clouds, golden stairways, trumpets, and angels.
Not a chance, Jeff.
You're in Africa!
And from where l sit it looks a lot more like the other place.
Why didn't you call us when he wakened?
-He just did.
-Oh, sure!
What goes on here?
You getting time and a half on this job?
Why didn't you call us? l told you, l didn't want any trouble!
What do you expect the phony caveman act to get you? l told you to stay away from him.
Now, l'm going to give you the only kind of lesson you seem to understand!
You'll have to come back!
-How's Jeff?
-He's okay.
We'll talk to him after a while about what happened at the wreck.
They say of the walking dead, that their souls can find no eternal rest, that they exist in torment. lf only people could find peace of soul and mind while they're alive.
We've had that fire going for two hours now. lf Mona could see it, she could have found her way back.
Once you're inside that tangle, you can't see very far.
She wouldn't have ventured into the jungle by herself.
They have her, l'm sure.
We'll have to go after her then.
-To the graveyard?
-l'll go too.
-Sure you want to go along?
-Well, l'd like to help.
This won't be any sightseeing expedition. lf they've had her this long it won't do any good.
They'll get you all. lt should be right about here. l clocked it on my way back last night.
You want to use the Very gun again?
You want a gun, Doc?
No, thanks. l'll take an extra flashlight.
All right, let's go.
Here's the path.
Art and Johnny, you two bring up the rear.
Keep a close watch out on both sides.
Doc, you stay in the middle.
You stay close behind me.
And don't fire unless you have to.
All right, let's go.
Hey, wait a minute. lt's Mona's bracelet. lt's on the other side of the boulder.
The old lady tells me this was a European cemetery for the people who dug the diamonds 100 years ago.
Art, Johnny, you two stay here. lf any of them show up try the flares.
-You want to come with us?
-l'll go.
Okay. You carry the gasoline.
-She's dead.
-Maybe not.
We'll get her, but let's figure on getting out of here, too.
Doc, empty the gas on both sides of the door.
All right.
Okay. Now, keep your eyes on them. l'll be right behind you. l'll try and hold them back with these flares.
She is dead.
Let's get out of here!
Mona! Look!
Mona! Are you all right?
Get her out of here! l'll cover you!
Okay. Come on!
They found you!
You're all right. l'm so glad...
She's as cold as...
She is all right, isn't she?
She hasn't said a word.
Maybe she's been drugged or in shock. l think you'd better get her to bed.
She's dead.
Your wife is dead, Mr. Harrison.
You saw her walk in here.
You all saw her walk...
Look at her eyes. She's not breathing.
Cold as death. l won't listen to that crazy talk.
You hear me? Now, no more of it.
-l'm going to put her to bed.
-Not in this house.
-Oh, please, Grandmother.
-We can take her out to the ship.
No. l know this is your house, but l'm not going to move her tonight.
Now, if you're afraid, you get out. l'm not afraid for myself. l'm afraid for you, for all of you.
Miss Peters, would you help me put her to bed?
Of course.
What about us?
Let them stay, the first bedroom.
We may need them.
Mona, why don't you close your eyes and get some sleep?
Jeff, you up?
-How's Mona?
-No change.
-You willing to go down tomorrow?
-Well, the safe's right there. l figure one more dive and we should be able to get to it.
Why?
You want to pull out? l ought to think about Mona. l ought to get her to a doctor.
Help! Help! Jeff! Harrison! She's crazy!
-Help! Help!
-Mona!
Jeff, help me! l can't stop her!
Light more candles. Lots of them.
He's dead. She knifed him.
Then she went for me.
Tell Sam to bring up all the big candles he can find.
Now force her back to her room with these.
They're afraid of fire. l guess it's the only thing that can destroy them.
She's sick, Mrs. Peters.
She's out of her head, isn't she? l'm sorry, Mr. Harrison. l know exactly how you feel.
Put a couple more in the doorway. lf fire'll work here, it'll work underwater, too.
Keep that blaze like that, and they won't bother you.
-They'll stay inside.
-l understand.
-Unless they have another way out.
-lt's worth a try.
We might have them bottled up.
Anyway, you and your men will be all right if you stay near the fire.
We'll be here.
Let's go.
The way l figure it, it can't be much of a safe. l should be able to cut it open in five or ten minutes.
Now, while l'm burning off the hinges, you stand by with another torch. lf any of them do show up, you hold them off with your torch.
Hope that fire keeps them out of circulation. lt'll be dark before we're through.
About that damaged compressor, l'm glad we found out before we dived.
We could wait till tomorrow. l thought you wanted to pull out tomorrow and get Mona to Dakar.
-Another day won't matter.
-Look, day or night, it's dark down there.
Besides, tomorrow l might have cold feet, like you've got now.
Okay!
Doc, you take care of the intercom so we can talk to each other, huh?
Sure thing, Jeff.
-Harrison, can you hear me?
-I hear you.
-Air pressure okay?
-Pressure's okay.
All right, I'll go ahead.
You follow at 10 feet. And watch my line!
Go ahead.
Good luck, Jeff.
You too, George.
I'm on the bottom.
Can you hear me, George?
I hear you, and I see you.
Feed me some more line.
All right, Jeff.
More line.
She's a real old clunker with outside hinges!
You know,
I think I can get into her with a scout knife.
Stuff is burning like firewood.
I'll have the first hinge off in a minute.
-Jeff! They're all around me.
-Can you hold them off?
I don't know.
I'm working on the second hinge.
-How much longer?
-Just one more minute.
I've got the hinges off.
I've got it.
I need 10 seconds to get out of here.
I can't hold them off! I'm going up!
Take me up! Take me up!
Send the diver stage down.
There are two of them waiting to jump me.
I want to make sure my lines are clear.
And when I give you the word,
start winding away like mad.
We understand, Jeff. Give us the word.
It worked! Where's Harrison?
He's just breaking surface now.
They're all over him! Four or five of them.
Use the flare.
Send down the diver's stage.
Wind me up clear of the deck.
What's with Harrison?
He's lost a lot of blood. He's in his cabin.
-We're running out of flares.
-Save them.
-Look! They're coming on board.
-Get the torches and the kerosene.
Yes, sir.
Let's see if we can keep it.
Take it to the cabin and lock yourself in.
Patrol the decks.
That torch can set us afire.
-How many flares left?
-Two, sir.
Keep that bunch covered. Come on.
Fire one into their laps. l'm going to pick up that torch.
Johnny! Behind you!
Doc, open up! Let me in!
You got some lighter fluid? Cleaning fluid?
Anything that'll burn?
Yeah, in the desk drawer.
-Give them those lousy diamonds!
-Don't anybody try that.
-You got a better idea?
-Yeah, we'll fight our way out.
Who's going to carry you while l do the fighting? l'll manage.
-You're in great shape for running.
-l'll be all right in a minute. l'll take this and make a break for it. lf l get through, l'll head for shore in the launch.
They'll follow me, and that'll give you a chance to get away.
Don't try it, Jeff.
You want it so bad, take it!
-He won't get far with those diamonds.
-You are a fool, Harrison.
-He's not trying to steal the diamonds.
-Shut up.
Well, he saved your life and mine. That's more than you could do on your bad leg. l know him better than you.
Break out that dinghy.
-You're safe! l was so worried. l saw the...
-Later! We've got things to do. Come on.
Maybe she's coming out of it.
Mona!
They sure have her hypnotized.
Come on.
So, you succeeded where all the others failed. l thought you might.
Listen, there's a whole flock of them after this. They'll be here in a few minutes, and they're playing pretty rough. And l don't want to be around here when they get here.
And l don't want Jan around, or you, either, Mrs. Peters. l figure we can get into the car, take Mona, and clear out.
We can meet up with Harrison at Dakar.
Well, l'd split my end of the take with you. l figure you've got something coming after all these years.
That is, if there is a take. l'm still not sure we found the diamonds.
-How do you get this open?
-lt's older than the Pyramids.
They didn't have any springs or screws, of course.
But they did know something about levers. Usually...
Give me your scarf quick.
Get the launch and start it up.
We'll be going back to the boat in two minutes. lf any of them show up, hold them off with the torches. lf they come near, l'm leaving.
Tell the girl to bring me that chest.
Tell her if there's any funny business, l'll shoot you for trying to steal the diamonds and deserting us while we were under attack.
Well, that's not true!
He took all the risk himself.
-Listen, Harrison...
-l haven't the time.
Peewee and Johnny are getting steam up.
Mike and Tony are waiting at the launch. l'm taking Mona and the diamonds out of here. l just wrote a new deal.
Give it to him.
Maybe, you got it open.
How are you going to know?
-No, please, don't, you'll ruin it.
-l'll find a way.
You follow me, l'll kill you.
But the diamonds should really be yours.
You found them, you saved them.
Thanks, Doc. Come here.
We have to make a run for the launch.
You understand?
Come on!
Go on! Get in!
He's dead.
She did it.
-lt happened so fast.
-Let's get him inside.
But you don't even know for sure if they want the diamonds.
Maybe they just wanted the chest.
We could have seen the end of them.
They want the diamonds.
They'll be back when they find the chest is empty.
But how could l destroy them even if l wanted to?
Cast them to the winds.
Scatter them over the sea so that no man'll ever find them.
Come with me, Jan.
We can be on the ship in a few minutes and out of the bay in 10 more.
Where will they catch us, in New York?
No matter where you go, they'll follow you.
Well, l'll get rid of the diamonds fast. l'll turn them over for cash.
They'll be sold in every capital in the world.
What would they do? Picket all the jewelry stores on Fifth Avenue?
Look, Jan, l want you with me. l want you to enjoy the money, too. l want you to marry me. l think l'd like that, Jeff. l can't go. l can't leave like this.
You mean, you believe all this, too?
That if l dump the diamonds they'll disappear?
Yes, it's true.
They'll stop walking the Earth.
They'll find their eternal rest.
The diamonds must be destroyed.
You can't rob them of this.
Jan!
She believes.
She's spent a lifetime believing.
You can't rob her of this.
Well, l can't throw them away.
Maybe l wish l could.
But l'm gonna take them with me.
And you're coming with me, too.
Both of you. l can't leave you behind, not when they're still prowling around. l'm staying right here.
But you can't stay here now. lt's too dangerous.
-l'm sorry, but if l have to, l'll carry you.
-l believe you would.
We don't have any time, Mrs. Peters. l'll put you off wherever you say. lf you like, l'll arrange to get you back here later.
Help her in.
Wait!
They've returned for the diamonds.
-What are we waiting for?
-Please, not yet.
We're safe enough now.
Captain Peters.
Must you go on?
All right.
Okay, take them.
The diamonds, Mrs. Peters.
They're yours. Do what you want with them.
Thank you.
Thank you.
At last, Jeremy Peters.
At long last. l'll probably never be rich again.
Hello, I'm Patrick Macnee.
The holiday season is my favorite time of year.
Families get together, they come from all parts of the continent.
People really seem to enter into the spirit of things.
A tradition in our family for many Christmas' has been to watch the movie, Scrooge.
It was taken from
Charles Dickens' novel,
A Christmas Carol which was written in 1843.
There have been several versions of this film, but my favorite is George Minter's.
It was made in 1951.
It starred Alastair Sim.
It really seemed to capture the true essence of the Dickens novel.
After all...
A Christmas Carol, is a story of redemption,
Dickens himself called it a sentimental romance.
It just seemed to capture the true holiday spirit so well.
Why don't you and your families join me in watching this Christmas classic,
Scrooge.
"Hark the Herald Angels Sing"
"Glory to the new born king!"
"Peace on earth and mercy mild,"
"God and sinners reconciled."
"Joyful all ye nations rise,"
"Join the triumphs of the skies,"
"With angelic hosts proclaim,"
"Christ is born in Bethlehem."
"Hark the herald angels sing,"
"Glory to the new born king!"
Old Marley was as dead as a doornail.
This must be distinctly understood or nothing wonderful can come of the story I'm going to relate.
The registry of burial was signed by Scrooge and Scrooge's name was good on the London Exchange for anything he chose to put his hand to.
Ah, Mr. Scrooge.
Your servant, sir.
Are you ooff home to keep Christmas?
I am not in the habit of keeping Christmas, Sir.
Then why are you leaving so early?
Because, Sir, Christmas is in habit of keeping men from doing business.
Come it's the nature of things that ants toil and grasshoppers sing and play, Mr. Scrooge.
An ant is what it is, and a grasshopper is what it is, and Christmas, Sir, is a humbug, good day.
Ha ha ha ha ha.
Mr. Scrooge, Sir.
Who are you?
Samuel Wilkins, Sir.
Oh yes, You owe me a little matter of twenty-odd pounds, I believe.
Well if you want to pay it, come to my place of business.
I don't conduct my aoffairs in the teeth of inclement weather.
I - I can't pay you, Sir.
I'm not surprised.
Not unless you give me more time.
Did I ask you for more time to lend you the money?
Oh, no, Sir!
Then why should you ask me for more time to pay it back?
Can't take me wife to a debtors' prison.
Then leave her behind.
Why should she go to a debtors' prison anyway?
She didn't borrow the twenty pounds, you did.
Eh... what does your wife got to do with it?
For that matter, what have I got to do with it? Good afternoon.
But, Mr. Scrooge, it's Christmas!
Christmas has even less to do with it, my dear sir, than your wife has or I have.
You still owe me twenty pounds and you are not in the position to repay if it was in the middle of a heat wave on August bank holiday. Good afternoon.
"Holy infant so tender and mild,"
"Sleep in heavenly peace."
Be ooff with you!
Will.
Have I the pleasure of addressing
Mr. Scrooge or Mr. Marley?
Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years.
In fact, he died seven years ago this very day.
Well, we have no doubt that his generosity is well represented by his... surviving partner.
At this festive season of the year,
Mr. Scrooge, it is more than usually desirable that we should make some slight provision for the poor and destitute.
Are there no prisons?
Plenty of prisons.
And the union work houses, are they still in operation?
They are.
I wish I could say they were not.
And the Treadmill and the Poor Law, they're still in full vigor, I presume?
Both very busy, Sir.
Oh, from what you said at first
I was afraid that something had happened to stop them in their useful course.
I'm very glad to hear it.
I don't think you quite understand us, Sir.
A few of us are endeavoring to raise a fund to buy the poor some meat and drink and means of warmth.
Why?
Because it is at Christmas time, that want is most keenly felt. and abundance rejoices.
Uh, what can I put you down for?
Ha! ...nothing.
You wish to be anonymous?
I wish to be left alone.
Since you ask me what I wish, Sir, that is my answer.
I helped to support the establishments
I have mentioned.
Those who are badly ooff must go there.
Many can't go there.
And some would rather die.
If they would rather die, they'd better do it and decrease the surplus population.
Besides, it's not my business.
Isn't it, Sir?
No.
It is enough for a man to understand his own business without interfering with other peoples', mine occupies me constantly.
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Who's that?
Your nephew, Uncle.
It's you, is it?
Well, what do you want?
Neither to borrow money or beg a mortgage, Uncle.
Only to wish you a Merry Christmas!
Keep Christmas in your own way and leave me to keep it in mine.
But you don't keep it!
And let me leave it alone then.
Much good may it do you to keep it.
Much good it has ever done you.
It's certainly done me no harm.
No, your wayward nature has done that.
And your marriage.
My marriage was the making of me.
The ruin of you, you mean.
Why don't you come and see for yourself, if you won't take my word for it.
Come and dine with us tomorrow.
No... thank you.
But why? ...Why?
Why do you marry against my wishes?
Because I fell in love.
You fell in love.
With a woman as penniless as yourself.
Oh, good evening, Nick.
We've never had any quarrel that I've ever been party to.
I ask nothing of you.
I came here in the spirit of bright good will and I won't let you dampen it.
So a Merry Christmas to you any way, Uncle.
Good evening.
And a Happy New Year.
Good Evening.
Humbug!
How is Mrs. Cratchit and all the small assorted Cratchits?
Very well, Sir. Thank you.
All chomping at the bit for
Christmas to begin, eh?
Oh yes, Sir, all very eager.
And the little lame boy.
Which one is he?
Tim, Sir.
That's right. How is he?
We're in high hopes he's getting better, Sir.
Good.
A Merry Christmas to you.
Thank you, Sir, and a
Merry Christmas to you, Sir, I'm sure.
Thank you.
Come along Tim, my dear, I've got to go.
Did you have a lovely time looking at all the wonderful things?
Yes, thank you, Ma-ma.
Did you get the big goose?
It's the biggest goose you ever did see.
As big as you and as fast as a beetle.
Wait 'til your father sees it.
His eyes will pop right out of his head and he'll forget all about ornery old Mr. Scrooge. Ha ha ha!
You're not feeling too tired are you, dear?
Not a bit, Ma-ma!
If your father was here, he'd carry you home on his shoulder.
Yes, I love having a ride on his shoulder.
It's been almost as cruel to keep him working in that cold little room just as late as he possibly can.
Christmas Eve or no Christmas Eve, the old Ogre.
You want the whole day ooff tomorrow, I suppose?
If quite convenient, Sir?
It's not convenient!
And it's not fair.
If I stopped your half-a-crown for it, you'd think yourself ill-used, wouldn't you? Hmm!?
But you don't think me ill-used, if I pay a days wages for no work,
'Tis only once a year, Sir.
That's a poor excuse for picking a man's pocket every 25th of December.
Yes, Sir. I'm sure. I'm very sorry, Sir, to cause you such an inconvenience.
It's the family more than me, Sir.
They put their hearts into Christmas as it were, Sir.
Yes, and put their hands into my pockets as it were, Sir.
I suppose you better have the whole day.
But be back all the earlier the next morning.
I will indeed, Sir! Thank you, Sir!
It's more than generous of you, Sir.
Yes, I know it is. You don't have to tell me.
Merry Christmas, Sir!
A Merry Christmas, Sir.
You, a clerk on fifteen shillings a week, with a wife and a family, talking about a Merry Christmas. Haha.
I'll retire to bedlam.
Waiter.
Yes.
More bread.
Take me extra, Sir.
No more bread.
Scrooge.
Jacob Marley.
Scrooge.
Hu - hu- humbug!
Oh...
Hum...
- bug.
Scrooge.
Aaaaaaaaah!
Who are you?!?!
Ask me who I was.
All right, all right, who were you then?!
In life, I was your partner,
Oh!
What do you want with me?!
Much.
Huh!
Huh, huh, huh!
In that case... can you sit down?
I can.
Well do it then!
You don't believe in me.
I-I don't.
Why do you doubt your senses?
Because a little thing aoffects them.
A slight disorder of the stomach makes them cheat.
You... you... might be an undigested bit of beef.
Huh! ...a piece of cheese... a fragment of an underdone potato.
There's more of gravy than a grave in you, whatever you are.
You see that toothpick?
I do.
You're not looking at it!
But I see it not withstanding.
Oh.
Well then,
I'm just going to swallow this and
I'll be tortured for the rest of my life by a legion of hob goblins, all of my own creation.
It's all humbug, I tell you!
Wahahahahaohoh!!!!
Mercy! ...mercy, mercy!
Man of the worldly mind, do you believe in me or not?
Yes, I do, I do, I do... I must.
But why do you walk the earth?
And why do you come to me?
It is required of every man that the spirit within him should walk abroad with his fellow men.
If it goes not forth in life it is condemned to do so after death.
It is doomed to wander through the world! Aaaaaah! Woe is me!!!
And witness what it cannot share, but might have shared on earth and turned to happiness.
Why are you fettered?
I wear the chain I forged in life,
I made it link by link and yard by yard. I girded it on of my own free will and of my own free will...
I wore it.
You have my sympathy.
Ahhhh... you do not know the weight and length of strong chain you bear yourself.
It was full as heavy and as long as this, seven Christmas Eve's ago and you have labored on it since.
It is a ponderous chain.
Mark me!
In life, my spirit never roved beyond the limits of our money changing hold.
Now I am doomed to wander without rest or peace... incessant torture and remorse.
But it was only that you were a good man of business, Jacob.
Business!!! Mankind was my business!
The common welfare was my business.
And it is at this time of the rolling year that I suoffer most.
Hear me!
My time is nearly gone.
I come tonight to warn you that you have yet a chance and hope of escaping my fate.
A chance and hope of my procuring,
Ebenezer.
Thank you, Jacob.
You were always a good friend of mine.
You will be visited by three spirits.
What?
Was that the chance of hope that you mentioned, Jacob?
It was.
Oh, well...
In that case, never-mind.
I think I'd rather not.
Without their visits you can not hope to shun the path I tread.
Expect the first when the bell tolls One.
Look to see me no more.
And look here... that you may remember for your own sake,
What has passed between us.
Why do they lament?
They seek to interfere for good in human measures.
And have lost their powers... forever.
Are you the spirit who's coming was foretold to me?
I am.
Who and what are you?
I am the Ghost of Christmas Past.
Long past?
No, your past.
And what is your business here with me?
Your welfare.
Huh... my welfare.
Your reclamation.
Take heed, rise, and walk with me.
Through the window?
Are you afraid?
I-but I- I am a mortal.
I'm liable to fall.
There but a touch of my hand and you shall be upheld in more than this.
Good heavens!
You know this place?
Know it?!
I was a boy here.
They are the chains of the things that have been.
They do not know we are here.
Look!
There's my old school.
How lonely and deserted it looks.
Not quite deserted.
A solitary boy, yourself Ebenezer, forgotten by his friends is left there still.
I know.
Ebenezer!
Fan!
It's fact.
Oh, dear brother, I have come to bring you home.
Home, home, home!
Home?
Yes!
Home for good and all!
Home forever and ever.
Father is so much kinder than he used to be that home is like heaven.
For you, perhaps, but not for me.
He doesn't know me, nor even what I look like.
Same as I hardly know you now that you're quite a woman.
Ma-ma must have looked just as you look now, just before she died.
Perhaps that is what has changed his mind towards you.
He spoke to me so gently one night when I was going to bed, that I wasn't afraid to ask him, just once more, that you might come home.
And he said, "Yes, you should," and sent me in the carriage to bring you, and you're never to come back here anymore, and you're never to be lonely again.
Never to be lonely again.
Never, as long as I live!
Well then, you must live forever, Fan.
Well, nobody else ever cared for me.
Nobody else ever will.
You must live forever, Fan!
Oh, dear brother, what nonsense!
Everyone loves you very much.
You must forgive Pa-pa and forget the past.
For our dearest mother's sake.
Oh, Fan...
Bring down, Master Scrooge's box.
Your sister was always a delicate creature whom a breath might have withered.
But she had a large heart.
She had.
She died a married woman and had,
I think, children.
One child.
True, your nephew.
She died... giving him life.
As your mother died, giving you life.
For which your father never forgave you, as if you were to blame.
You recall this, no doubt.
Recall it!
Why bless my soul!
It's at Old Fezziwig's!
I was apprenticed here.
Look there's Old Fezziwig and
Mrs. Fezziwig, top couple!
Oh, was there ever a kinder man?
And yet, what does this party cost him in your mortal money?
Three or four pounds, at most.
Is that so much that he deserves your praise?
Oh, but it's not that!
The happiness he gave us, his clerks and apprentices, and everybody who knew him.
It was as great as if it had... as if it had cost a fortune.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
Something, I think.
No, no, no, no...
Just that I'd like to have a word with my own clerk, Bob Cratchit, just now.
That's all.
Turn and see yourself in love,
Ebenezer Scrooge.
It's only a shilling ring, Alice, but one day, it'll be a gold one.
...when I'm rich enough.
Oh, it's a beautiful ring!
But I mustn't accept it.
Why not?
Because it's not good enough for you?
Oh, no, no.
Oh, because I'm not rich enough for you?
How foolish of you, of course not!
But you're still so young, you may have a change of heart one day.
Oh, dearest Alice, if ever I have a change of heart towards you, it'll be because my heart has ceased to beat.
And it makes no diofference that I'm poor?
I love you because you're poor, not proud and foolish.
Will you... always feel like that?
As long as I live,
...longer... forever and ever.
Then...
I accept your ring.
Alice
Ebenezer
Ha ha ha ha
God Bless you, Alice,
From now to eternity, we, two, are as one.
I've seen enough!
Yet more awaits you...
I won't look!
You shall.
Now see yourself in business, Ebenezer.
Come, come it's a busy week.
We are good friends, I think, besides good men of business.
We're men of vision and progress.
Why don't you sell out while the going's good?
You'll never get a better ooffer.
You should be aid to the machine and the factory and the vested interest.
We small traders are all history,
Mr. Fezziwig.
Huh, Doh-Doh's.
Yes, I dare say we are.
And the ooffer is a very large one,
I have to admit, but it's not just for money alone that a man spends a lifetime building up a business, Mr. Jorkin.
Ha ha ha
Well, if it isn't, I'd like you to tell me what you do spend a lifetime building up a business for?
It's to preserve a way of life that one knew and loved.
No, I can't see my way to selling out to the new vested interest, Mr. Jorkin.
I have to be loyal to the old ways and die out with them, if needs must.
Well, ha ha ha. You know what they say about time and tide, Mr. Fezziwig.
They wait for no one.
There's more in life than money, Sir.
Oh, excuse me, Mr. Fezziwig, Sir?
Uh yes, yes, my boy?
The foreman would appreciate a word with you, if you could spare the time, Sir.
Uh, yes, yes, of course.
Excuse me a moment.
Ha ha ha, you can't teach an old dog new tricks. Can you, Mr. Scrooge?
Nor teach the leopard to change its spots.
Well I - I think I know what Mr. Fezziwig means though, Sir.
Oh, so you hate progress and money too, do you?
Well no, I don't hate them, Sir, but... well, perhaps the machines aren't such a good thing for mankind, after all.
Sage and onions, my dear fellow!
Ha! Gammon and spinach.
Why, suppose I told you, you could get twice the salary
Old Fezziwig can aofford to pay you? as a clerk in a new company?
What would you say to that, eh?
Well I - I'd still say money wasn't everything, Sir.
Ha, well if it ain't,
I don't know what is.
Come and see me one day anyway, young fellow.
You're smart and you're no fool.
That's the kind of buck they're looking for these days.
No, Spirit, not here.
Yes, here.
Fan... your brother.
Do you know me?
Ebenezer.
I sent for you.
Promise me...
Promise you what, Fan?
I'll promise you anything, dearest.
Only there, there isn't going to be any need.
You're going to get well again, Fan.
No...
You are! you are.
Dear God, you must!
Fan you-you-you can't die.
Fan, you mustn't die!
You're going to get well again, Fan.
Fan, you're going to get well again!
How could you have brought me here?
Have you no mercy, no pity?
Ebenezer.
Brother?
Ebenezer?
Promise me... you'll take care of my boy.
Promise me you'll take care my...
You heard her.
Forgive me, Fan.
Forgive me.
Forgive me, Fan!
Forgive me, Fan.
Well, there you are, me buck.
That's where you'll start.
And you can work your way up as high as the dome in St. Paul's Cathedral, if you have a mind to do so.
Control the cash box and you control the world.
By the way, how did Old Fezziwig take it when you said you were leaving him?
He wished me luck, Sir.
No hard feelings, eh?
Starting with a clean slate?
Good.
And now let me introduce you to your fellow clerk. Mr. Marley!
Just a moment please.
Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge, the new clerk.
Mr. Jacob Marley, our wizard of the accounts.
Your servant, Mr. Marley.
Your servant, Mr. Scrooge.
I'm sure you two gentlemen will get along famously.
I'm sure we shall Mr. Jorkin, Sir.
Yes, heh heh, well I'll leave you to it.
Thank you.
Take your place, no doubt, seems new and strange to you.
Somewhat.
The world is on the verge of new and great changes, Mr. Scrooge.
Some of them, of necessity, will be violent. Do you agree?
No, I think the world is becoming a very hard and cruel place, Mr. Marley.
One must steel oneself to survive it.
Not be crushed under with the weak and the infirm.
I think we have many things in common, Mr. Scrooge.
I hope so, Mr. Marley.
Oh, excuse me, Mr. Scrooge, Sir.
Yes?
What's your present salary?
Five shillings a week, Sir.
You can stay for four shillings a week.
Well yes, Sir. Thank you, Sir.
Isn't that Old Fezziwig?
Alice.
The same Alice you swore to love for all eternity, Ebenezer.
She is not changed by the harshness of the world.
But you are.
Then you no longer love me?
You no longer love me.
When have I ever said that.
In words? ...Never.
Well, in what then?
In the way you have changed.
But how have I changed towards you?
By changing toward the world.
But, is it, is it such a terrible thing for a man to struggle for something better than he is?
Another idol has replaced me in your heart.
A golden idol.
It's singular.
The world, that can be so brutally cruel to the poor, professes to condemn the pursuit of wealth in the same breath.
You fear the world too much.
Ha! ...with reason!
But, I - I - I am not changed toward you!
Aren't you?
Our promise is an old one.
It was made when we were both poor and content to be so.
If you had never made that promise, tell me... would you seek me out and try to win me now?
Of course, I would.
No.
If you were free today, would you choose a direless girl with - with neither wealth nor social standing?
You, who now weigh everything by gain!
I bring you nothing but repentance and regret.
That is why...
I released you.
You know I'm right then?
I must bow to your conviction that you are.
May you be happy in the life you have chosen.
Thank you.
I shall be.
Goodbye.
Show me no more.
But I told you.
These are but shadows of the things that have been.
That they are what they are.
Do not blame me.
Take me away!
Very well.
But we have not done yet, Ebenezer Scrooge.
We do, but turn, another page.
And as your business prospered,
Ebenezer Scrooge, a golden idol took possession of your heart... as Alice said it would.
May we hear those figures, Mr. Snedrig?
At your pleasure.
Certainly, Mr. Groper.
Well, gentlemen, after seventeen years of existence, the Amalgamated Mercantile Society's books show the startling figures of a liability of three thousand- two hundred pounds, eight shillings and 10 pence.
And a total asset of eleven pounds, eight shillings, and 10 pence.
Well at least the 10 pences cancel each other out.
How much of this is the company's capital?
All of it, Mr. Rosebed.
In short, Sir, you're not only a bankrupt, you're an embezzler of the company's funds.
Ha ha ha ha ha
I also beat my wife and skewer innocent babies when in my cups.
Take a very cool attitude, if I may say so, Sir.
So do Mr. Scrooge and Mr. Marley.
They're not facing prosecution for the capital ooffense.
Oh, but gentlemen it could have been any one of you.
We're all cut-throats under this fancy linen, Mr. Snedrig.
I must ask you to speak for yourself, Mr. Jorkin!
Well, what would you gain to prosecute me?
All you would get out of it is about eleven pounds odd.
And to pack me ooff to Botany Bay, would be poor compensation for the panic that would arise among the share holders.
Panic, Sir?
Yes, panic.
Would any of you gentlemen care to deny that if this juicy little scandal leaked out now the annual shareholders meeting would resemble an orchestra of scorched cats.
Result... bankruptcy all around.
Strike that speech out of the minutes!
Yes, Sir.
Mr. Jorkin doesn't exaggerate the imprudence of allowing his... misdemeanors to be made public.
Are you in sympathy with Mr. Jorkin by any chance, Mr. Scrooge?
Not, I confess, with the admittance.
Mr. Marley and I have a proposition to make to the representatives of the company which might solve some of the difficulties to our general advantage.
The devil you have!
You ought to watch these two fellows, you know?
They'd skin Jack Ketch alive and he'd never know they'd done it.
Can we hear the proposition?
Shall I be Spokesman?
Mr. Marley and myself are prepared to make good out of our own private resources, the sum of money appropriated by Mr. Jorkin.
Ha, ha, ha, reprieved, reprieved!
Curfew shall not ring tonight,
Mr. Snedrig.
Order, order!
In return, we wish to be allowed the option of buying up further shares in the company.
To a maximum of fifty-one percent of the total.
In short gentleman, if you wish to save the fair name of the company by accepting their generous ooffer, ha! They become the company.
Fifty-one percent!? Never, never!
Out of question!
Never! Fifty-one percent!?
Out of question! and also out of order, Mr. Scrooge!
Pardon me... if you can find the grace to,
I've just come from Mr. Marley's with a message for Mr. Scrooge.
Well, can I give it to him?
Well please your great kind self, dear.
I'm to say... that Mr. Marley ain't expected to live through the night, and that if Mr. Scrooge wants to take his leave of him, he should nip along smartly or there won't be no Mr. Marley to take leave of as we know the use of the word. tch tch tch
He's breathing very queer when he does breathe at all.
Excuse me, Mr. Scrooge.
I'm busy.
It's about Mr. Marley, he's dying, Sir.
Well what can I do about it?
If he's dying, he's dying.
Well, the message was for you to go at once, Sir.
It is now a quarter to five.
The business of the office is not yet finished,
I shall go when the office is closed.
At seven o'clock.
Yes, Sir.
He'll come at Seven.
I'll try and get Mr. Marley to hold out
'til then, I'm sure.
Much obliged.
Good night to ya.
And a Merry Christmas if it ain't out of keepin' with the situation.
Thank you, the same to you.
I hope you'll find Mr. Marley well, Sir.
I should think that's highly unlikely.
Yes, I suppose so, Sir, but... seems odd to think of the place without him, Sir.
Why should it be anymore odd than it was with him, hmm?
We've all got to die, Cratchit.
I suppose you will want the whole day ooff tomorrow, as usual.
If quite convenient, Sir?
Ha, ha... every Christmas you say the same thing.
And every Christmas, it's just as inconvenient as it was the Christmas before. Goodnight.
Goodnight, Sir.
Who's that, the doctor?
No, Sir, the undertaker.
Ha.
You don't believe in letting the grass grow under your feet, do you?
Ours is a highly competitive profession, Sir.
Is he dead yet?
I'll have another look, if you'd like?
No, don't bother.
I'll see for myself.
Oh, oh Jacob.
Well have they... have they seen to you properly?
Last rights and all that, hmm?
There's uh... there's nothing
I can do, hmm?
Oh?
What... particularly?
While...
Huh??
...there's still time...
Time?...
Time for what?
We...
We were wrong.
Huh?
Wrong.
Wrong?
Oh...
Well we - we can't be right all the time.
Nobody's perfect.
We've been no worse than the next man.
Or better, if it comes to that.
You mustn't reproach yourself, Jacob.
We are wrong.
What?
Save... yourself.
What? Save myself?
Save myself from what?
Hmm?
Speak up
Is he dead?
Yes.
Just like you said.
I always know.
One shadow more.
No!
No more.
I - I cannot bear it.
Jacob Marley worked at your side for eighteen years.
He was the only friend you ever had.
But what did you feel when you signed the registrar at his burial when you took his money, his house, and his few lean sticks of furniture?
Did you feel a little pity for him?
Look at your face, Ebenezer.
A face of a wrenching, grasping, scraping, covetous old sinner.
No... no... no, no, no... no.
No... no... no, no, no...
Ha ha ha ha.
Heh heh heh heh.
Come in, come in, Ebenezer Scrooge.
I await you.
Yes, I'm - I'm coming.
Come in! ...Come in!
I'm coming.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha...
Ohhhhh...
Ebenezer, come in. He he he he he.
Come in, come in! And know me better, man.
Heh heh heh... I am the Spirit of
Christmas Present.
Look upon me.
You've never seen the like of me before... Have you?
Never.
And I wish the pleasure had been indefinitely postponed.
So... is your heart still unmoved towards us, then?
I'm too old and beyond hope!
Go and redeem some younger, more promising creature, and leave me to keep Christmas in my own way.
Mortal!
We spirits of Christmas do not give only one day of our year.
We live the whole 365.
So is it true of the child born in Bethlehem.
He does not live in men's hearts only one day of the year, but in all the days of the year.
You have chosen not to seek him in your heart.
Therefore, you shall come with me and seek him in the hearts of men of good will.
Come.
Touch my robe.
Heh heh heh ha ha ha.
"Hark! The herald angels sing,"
"Glory to the newborn King!"
What place is this?
A place where miners live, who labor in the bowels of the earth.
But they know me.
Come.
Joyful, all ye nations, rise,
Join the triumph of the skies;
With angelic hosts, proclaim,
Christ is born in Bethlehem!
Hark! The herald angels sing,
Glory to the newborn King!
Why, it's Cratchit!
It's Bob Cratchit.
He's coming mother!
Father's here with tiny Tim!
Here, Martha.
You hide... and we'll tell him you've been held up and who knows when you'll be here.
Yes! Go hide!!
Oh, goodness! Where?
Behind the scullery door, quickly, Martha!
Hi.
A Merry Christmas.
Why... where's our Martha?
Oh, she's not coming.
Not coming?
Not coming on Christmas day?
Yes I am, Father!
I can't bear to let them tease you.
Why, bless your heart.
It never would have been Christmas, if they'd kept you late.
Is the pudding still singing in the copper, Peter?
Yes, come and hear it.
You come, too, Mary and Belinda!
Come, Tim.
You come along as well, Martha.
Come and hear the pudding singing in the copper.
I'll come in a minute.
All right.
Sit you down before the fire, and have a nice warm, the Lord bless you. that I never did think I'd get away.
We had to clear away this morning, and then I ran all the way so's to be here in time.
How did little Tim behave in church?
As good as gold and better.
Sometimes he gets thoughtful sitting by himself so much and thinks the strangest things you ever heard.
He told me, he wasn't going to feel shy if people looked at him because he was a cripple, as it might be pleasant to them, being in church, to remember upon Christmas day, who made lame beggars walk and blind men see.
He's growing strong and hearty though,
Martha, my dear.
Isn't he, my love?
Spirit... tell me will... will tiny Tim live?
I see a vacant seat in the poor chimney corner, and a crutch without an owner, carefully preserved.
If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future, none other of my way shall find him there.
Oh, no!
No!
Kind Spirit... say that he will be spared.
Why?
If he be like to die, he better do it and decrease the surplus population.
Well, my little cock sparrow, here's your own stool by the fire all ready for you.
There's such a goose, Martha!
I'm sure of it.
And the pudding! Oh, the pudding!
It shant be easy 'til it's eaten.
I confess, I've had my doubts about the quantity of the flour.
It'll be a perfect pudding my love.
A perfect pudding.
Won't it, Martha, my dear?
Eh, Tim?
It'll be the finest pudding in the whole of London this Christmas, and the goose'll be the finest goose.
And ours'll be the finest Christmas.
Here's the punch, all steaming hot.
Oh, good!
No, no, no, take your turn, one and all, if you please.
There's enough for one toast now and another after that. Thank you!
Thank you!
There! Bravo! There's bounty for you!
I declare I'd like to know how many families of our acquaintance could boast two rounds of the best gin punch!
None! No one!
Now, has everybody got his drink?
Yes! Yes!
Good. But before I give the toast,
I have a piece of momentous information for all, and Master Peter, in particular.
Master Peter?
Why, that's you, Peter!
What is it, Father? Yeah, what is it?
Master Peter, now grown to full estate and dignity as son of the house, and looking every inch the grand fellow he is, in one of my own collars,
Ha ha ha ha ha...
I have waited for this great moment, to advise him that I have my eye on a situation for him which will bring him, if obtained, full 5 and 6 pence weekly!
YA!! You'll be quite the independent gentleman now, Peter!
What next? I wonder.
Then a toast my love, my dearies.
To a Merry Christmas!
God bless us.
God bless us!
God bless us... every one.
I give you Mr. Scrooge, the founder of the feast.
Oh no, Father!
He doesn't deserve it!
I wish I had him here now, I'd give him a piece of my mind to feast himself upon.
My dear, the children... Christmas Day!
Could only be on Christmas day that I would drink the health of such a hard, stingy, unfeeling man as Mr. Scrooge.
You know he is, Robert, nobody knows it better than you do, poor fellow.
My dear,
Christmas day.
I'll drink his health for your sake and the days... not for his.
Long life to him. A Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
He'll be very happy and very merry, no doubt.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
He said that Christmas was
"humbug", and he believed it, too.
I told you so.
Well, a Merry Christmas and a Happy
New Year to the poor old man.
He wouldn't let me wish it to him personally, but here it is, never the less,
Uncle Scrooge!
Yes, to Scrooge!
Uncle Scrooge!
Well, I don't know that our drinking to him will do him much good.
Or do I. I hate him!
Oh, I forbid it! I'm sorry for him.
I couldn't feel angry with him, if I tried.
Who suoffers worse from his humors?
Himself always.
Look at the way he's taken it in his head to disown us without a shilling, and won't even come to dinner with us.
And what's the consequence?
He's only cheated himself out of a highly indigestible dinner.
It was a wonderful dinner!
Yes, it was a wonderful dinner.
Well I'm really glad you think so, Miss, because I personally haven't very much faith in these newlywed housekeepers.
Have you, Tupper?
Alas, as a bachelor,
I'm a wretched outcast, with no right to express an opinion on such a tender and delicate subject.
Have I... dear... distant... unmovable,
Miss Flora?
Now, you really are quite incorrigible,
Mr. Tupper.
Quite beyond hope.
...and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.
And though I have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have all faith so that I can remove mountains, and have not charity,
I am nothing.
Do you feel more rested now, my dear?
I do, bless your dear gentle heart.
Alice...
Do you know, me darlin',
I never thought there was anyone like you left in the whole wide world.
Cut me throat, rip me liver, if I'm tellin' a lie.
This is the happiest Christmas
I ever had!
Alice?
Alice!?
Spirit, are these people real or are they shadows?
They're real, we are the shadows.
Both of us?
Did you not cut yourself ooff from your fellow beings, when you lost the love of that gentle creature?
Where are you taking me now?
My time with you, Ebenezer, is almost done.
Will you profit by what I have shown you of the good in most men's hearts?
I don't know.
How can I promise?
If it's too hard a lesson for you to learn, then learn this lesson.
Spirit, are these yours?
They are man's.
They cling to me for protection from their fetters.
This boy is Ignorance.
This girl is Want.
Beware of them both, but most of all, beware of this boy.
But have they no refuge, no resource?
Are there no prisons?...
Are there no workhouses?
Are there no prisons?
Are there no workhouses?
Are there no prisons?
Are there no workhouses?
Are there no prisons?
Are there no workhouses?
Aaaah!
I am in the presence of the
Spirit of Christmas yet to come.
And you are going to show me shadows of things that have not yet happened, but will happen?
Spirit of the Future, I fear you more than any other specter that I've seen.
But even in my fear, I must tell you,
I am too old!
I cannot change.
I can't.
It is not that I am impenitent; it's just that I -
Oh, wouldn't it be better if I just went home to bed?
No?
Lead me, then.
He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings thou shalt trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler.
Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day;
A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee.
For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.
Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him:
I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.
Because thou hast made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation;
There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.
He shall call upon me, and I will answer him:
I will be with him in trouble;
I will deliver him, and honour him.
Shall I stop reading?
No, no... it's only the color. It hurts my eyes.
They're better now.
It makes them weak, by candlelight.
And I wouldn't show your father weak eyes, when he comes home, for the world.
It must be near his time.
Past it, rather.
But he seems to be walking a little slower than he used... these last few evenings.
Why I've known him walk, with tiny Tim on his shoulder, very fast, indeed.
So have I... Often.
So have I.
So have I.
But then, he was light to carry and his father loved him, so it was no trouble.
No trouble.
I'm a little late, my dear.
Please forgive me.
You must be cold and tired.
Sit near the fire.
No, no I'm... very content, my dear... very content.
I went to see the place where he will rest.
It's sheltered by green trees, my dear, and very quiet and still.
It was strange, but as I stood there,
I felt his hand slip in mine, as if he was standing beside me and comforting me.
I felt very peaceful, my dear.
He was telling me, you see, in his own little way, that he's happy.
Truly happy now... and that we must cease to grieve for him, and try to be happy, too.
Oh Tim... my Tiny Tim.
Poor Robert, Oh Robert... poor Robert.
Hello, Joe.
Huh.
Hi, Joe.
Hey.
Well, come on, then.
No, let the laundress go first.
No, no, dear, you was here first.
After you, I'm sure.
Heh heh heh heh!
Ha ha!
Oh look, Old Joe, it's a chance... if the chow lady, the laundress, and the undertaker haven't all met here at the same time without meaning it! Ha ha ha!
Well, you couldn't have met in a better place.
Let's go in the parlor.
You were made free of it long ago, eh? Heh heh heh
And the other two aren't strangers, heh...
Uh... wait a minute just 'til I shut the door to the shop, eh?
Just shut the door to the shop.
Oh! How it screeks!
There's not a rusted piece of metal in the place like its own hinges.
And, I'm sure, there are no old bones here like mine. Well, heh...
We're all suitable to our callin's, eh? He he he.
We're all well matched.
Come into the parlor.
Come into the parlor.
Who goes first?
What odds, now, that all met at the once.
Everyone's got a right to take care of themselves, he always did.
Oh, that's true enough, no one more so.
Why then, don't stand staring as if you was afraid, woman.
Who's the wiser?
We're not gonna pick holes in each other's coats, I suppose.
No, indeed!
No, we hope not!
Very well then, who's the worse for the loss of a few things like these?
Not a dead man, I suppose.
No indeed.
Ha ha!
If he wanted to keep 'em after he was dead, why wasn't he amiable in his lifetime?
If he had been, he'd have had somebody with him when he was struck with death.
Instead of lying, gasping out his last air alone be himself.
There never was a truer word spoke.
T'was a judgment on him.
I wish it was a little heavier one.
And it would been, if I could of laid me hands on anything else.
We knew pretty well we was helping ourselves, before we come here, I believe.
It's no sin.
Open the bungle, Joe.
No, no, I'll go first.
Just to show we all got trust in one another.
It's very polite of you,
I do grant, I'm sure.
Watch, fob, seal, pencil case, sleeve buttons, broach.
Yes... 8 shillings, this lot, and I wouldn't give you another 6 pence.
Not if I was boiled for life for not doing it.
Who's next?
Always a lady, dear.
I shall have to insist you all stop and watch mine, now that we're all so open and above with each other.
2 sheets, ya, 2 towels, ya, shirt, ya, teaspoons, 2 silver, uh, sugar tongs, foods assorted, four.
Yeah, 17 and 6.
That's how I come to ruin myself.
Yeah, if you ask for another penny might leave open question,
I'd regret me liberality.
Knock ooff half a crown.
Now open my bundle, Joe.
Come on, what's in it?
Aaaah...
Eh?
You wait and see.
Bed curtains.
Bed curtains?
Uh huh, bed curtains.
What'd you? You mean to say you took these down, rings and all, and... oooh, him lying there?
Yes I do, why not?
Heh heh, you was born to make a fortune, ma'am, and you... you certainly will.
These his blankets, too?
Who's else do ya think?
He ain't likely to take cold without 'em, I daresay.
Ha ha ha ha!
He didn't die of anything catching, did he?
Oh, don't you be afraid of it!
I wasn't too fond of his company
I'd loiter about him for such things, if he did.
And you can look through that
'til your eyes ache and you won't find a hole in it.
It's the best one he had, and a fine one, too.
They'd have wasted it, if it hadn't been for me.
What you mean, wasted it?
Well they'd have bedded him in this, of course.
But I took it ooff of him, again.
As if calico ain't good enough for burying.
Anyway, it's just as becoming to the body.
He couldn't have looked uglier than what he did in this one.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
It's poetic justice.
He frightened near everybody away from him when he was alive.
And now he benefits us when he's dead.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
No, I don't know much about it either way.
I only know he's dead.
When did he die?
Last night, I believe.
What was the matter with him?
I thought he'd never die.
So did he, I daresay.
What's he done with all his money?
Left it to his company, where else?
He didn't leave it to me... that's all I know.
Well, funeral won't cost much, that's certain.
Pardon my soul, I can't think of anyone who'll go to it.
I don't mind going... if the lunch were provided.
But I must be fed... or else I stay at home.
I know those men.
They're men of business, very wealthy, very important.
Who's funeral were they talking about?
Strange.
My usual place is over there, under the clock.
I ought to be there this time of day.
But I'm not.
I'm not!
Before I draw nearer to that stone, answer me one question.
Are these the shadows of things that must be?
Or are they only shadows of things that might be?
I know that men's deeds foreshadow certain ends, but if the deeds be departed from, surely the ends will change!
Tell me it is so with what you show me now.
Aaaaahhhhh...
Aaaaa, no Spirit, no, no, no!
Tell me I'm not already dead.
Tell me I'm not already dead!
Tell me I'm not already dead.
Hear me, Spirit,
I'm not the man I was.
Believe me, I'm not the man I was!
Why show me all this if I'm beyond all hope?
Oh, pity me, Spirit, pity me!
And help me!
Help me to sponge away the writing on the stone if I repent.
And I do repent, I do repent!
I'll make good, the wrongs
I've done my fellow man.
And, I'll - I'll change!
I'm not the man I was.
I'm not the man I was!
Believe me. Believe me!
I'm not the man I was!
Believe me!
I'm not the man I was.
I'm not the man I was!
I'm not the man... I was.
Ha ha ha... Heh heh heh...
Good morning, Sir.
Tell me... what day is it?
What day?
Why it's Christmas Day, of course, Sir.
Christmas Day?
Christmas Day, Christmas Day!
Then I haven't missed it.
The spirits must have done everything in one night.
But of course, they can do anything, can't they?
Of course, they can!
Ha ha heh heh heh ha ha ha...
Are you quite yourself, Sir?
What?
I don't know.
No, I - I don't think so.
I hope not!
What!?
The curtains are still here.
They're still here!
You didn't... you didn't tear them down and sell them.
Hmm?
They're here. Everything's here!
I'm here, ha ha ha ha ha... and the shadows of things that would be, can still be dispelled, and they will be.
I know they will be, I know.
Heh heh heh ha ha...
I - I -I don't know what to do!
Ha ha heh heh ha heh,
I'm as light as a feather! Ha ha ha...
I'm as happy as a...
I'm as happy as an angel!
I'm as... merry as a school boy!
Heh heh heh heh!
I'm as giddy... I'm as giddy as a drunken man, I never...
Ho ho ho ho...
A Merry Christmas, Ebenezer!
Heh heh heh... you old humbug!
Heh heh heh heh
And a Happy New Year!
...as if you deserved it!
Aaah!!
Merry Christmas, Mrs. Dilbur!
Same to you, Sir.
Well thank you, thank you, thank you.
And many, many of them...
Aaaaaah!
Aaah! Look once!...
Heh heh heh heh... Look, Mrs. Dilbur, there in the corner is where the Spirit of Christmas Present sat.
And there's the door where
Jacob Marley's ghost came through.
And there's the window where I saw the wandering spirit.
It's right! It's true!
It all happened! Oh I...
I don't know what day of the month it is, I...
I don't know how long
I've been amongst the spirits, I...
I don't know anything.
I never did know anything.
Heh heh heh! But now I know that I don't know anything!
Heh heh, I don't know anything.
I never did know anything.
But now I know that I don't know all the Christmas morning.
I must stand on my head.
I must stand on my head!
Aaaah!! Aaaah, aah, ahahh!!!!
Come back, come back!
Aaaah!! Aaaaah!
Come back, come back, Mrs. Dilbur!
Aaaah!! Aaaah, aah, ahahh!!!!
Shhh, please, please, Mrs. Dilbur.
I am not mad. Heh heh
Even if I, "woo"
Aaah!!
Don't be violent, Mr. Scrooge, Sir.
You'll force me to scream for the beagle!
The beagle, madam, ha!
A fig for the beagle.
A guinea?
Here, what for?
I'll give you one guess.
To keep me mouth shut?
Hmm?
Ho ho ho ho! To keep your mouth shut.
Oh no, ha ha ha!
No, no, no, Mrs. Dilbur.
It's for a Christmas present.
A Christmas present?
For me?
Of course, for you!
Ha ha ha
A Merry Merry Christmas.
Dear Mrs. Dilbur, how much do I pay you?
2 shillings a week.
2 shillings?
It's forthwith raised to 10!
10 shillings a week, here!
You're sure, you don't want to see a doctor?
A doctor? Certainly not!
Nor the undertaker! Ha!
Now ooff you go and enjoy yourself.
Like a good girl.
Bob's your uncle! Ha ha
Ha ha he he ha ha ha!
Merry Christmas, Mr. Scrooge!
In keeping with the situation!
Oh, very well then, heh heh heh
Oh, what a beautiful morning.
Hello there! Hello you!
You boy! You!
Who me?
Yes, you!
Do you know the butcher's in the next street but one?
I should hope so.
Heh, heh heh! Intelligent boy, remarkable boy.
Tell me, have they sold the prize turkey that was hanging there?
Not the little turkey, the big one?
The one as big as me?!
Yes, ha ha ha ha ha.
What a delightful boy.
Yes, my buck, the one as big as you.
It's hanging there still.
Is it?!
Very well then, go and buy it.
Won't occur!
No, no, no, wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
I'm in earnest.
Tell the butcher to bring it here, and I'll give him the name of the party he's to send it to.
Come back with the butcher and I'll give you a shilling.
Come back in less than five minutes and I'll give you half a crown!
Heh heh heh! An enchanting boy.
I'll send it to Bob Cratchit!
That's what I'll do. He'll never dream where it came from! He he
Ha ha! None of it's here,
I must have a label.
Label, label, label, label, label.
Label, label!
Label. Ha ha ha.
Heh heh! It's - It's twice the size of tiny Tim! Heh Heh Heh
Mr. Robert Cratchit, 2 Porter Street,
Camden Town.
That's you Robert, least ways there's no one else I know of.
I think I know who sent it.
Who?
Who??
Mr. Scrooge.
Oh dear, oh dear, whatever made you think it might be him?
I don't know, I just think it.
What would make Mr. Scrooge take such leave of his senses suddenly?
Christmas.
"In Scarlet Town where I was born,"
"There was a fair maid dwelling;"
"Made every youth cry Well-a-day,"
"Her name was Barbara Allen."
"All in the merry month of May,"
"When green buds they were swelling;"
"Young Jimmy Grove on his deathbed lay,"
"For love of Barb'ra Allen."
"So slowly, slowly she came up,"
"And slowly she came nigh him,"
"And all she said when there she came:"
"Young man, I think..."
Uncle Ebenezer!
Is it too late to accept your invitation to dinner?
Too late? I'm delighted, delighted!
My dear, look who it is!
Can you forgive a pig-headed old fool for having no eyes to see with, no ears to hear with, all these years?
Yes, you dear Uncle.
You've made Fred so happy.
Oh, bless your heart!
Dennis... polka.
Bravo, Uncle Scrooge!
Bravo!
Come on everybody.
Everybody!
Cratchit!
You're late.
Sir.
What do you mean by coming in here this time of day, hmm?
I'm very sorry, Sir.
I am behind my time, Sir.
Hmm, you are indeed!
Step this way, Mr. Cratchit, please.
It's only once a year, Sir.
It won't be repeated.
I was making rather merry yesterday, Sir.
Hmm hmm hmm hmm!
I'm sure you were.
Well we won't beat about the bush, my friend.
I'm not going to stand this sort of thing any longer.
Which leaves me no alternative but to raise your salary.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
Oh, I haven't taken leave of my senses, Bob.
I've come to them.
From now on,
I want to try to help you to raise that family of yours.
If you'll let me.
Well, we'll talk it over later, Bob, over a, over a bowl of hot punch, hmm?
Meanwhile, you just go and put some coal on that fire.
You go straight out and buy a new coal scuttle.
Yes, you do that before you dot another 'i', Bob Cratchit!
Ha ha ha, ho ho ho, heh heh, heh, ha ha ha!
Oh, I don't deserve to be so happy.
But I can't help it. Ha ha!
I - I - I just can't help it.
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Scrooge was better than his word.
He became as good a friend, as good a master, and as good a man as the good old city ever knew.
Or any other good old city, town, or borough in the good old world.
And to tiny Tim, who lived and got well again, he became a second father.
Uncle Scrooge!
And it was always said that he knew how to keep Christmas well, if any man alive possessed the knowledge.
May that be truly said of us, and all of us.
And so, as tiny Tim observed,
God bless us... every one.
"Sleep in heavenly peace,"
"Sleep in heavenly peace."
He knew thereafter, how to keep Christmas well.
Dickens.
What can I say?
It was 38 years ago that film was made.
And it still continues to delight young and old alike.
I know that our family looks forward every Christmas to spending this special time together, with Scrooge... Marley...
Bob Cratchit... all of them.
I hope you've enjoyed this version of "Scrooge".
And as tiny Tim so eloquently says,
God bless us... every one.
I'm Patrick Macnee.
Good night and thank you.
Oh... and Merry, Merry Christmas!
- Congratulations.
- We're so pleased.
A wonderful article in the paper about you,
Sir Oliver. It's wonderful, sir! Wonderful!
Good morning, Professor, or I should say Sir Oliver.
- Long article about you.
- Is there? Well, well, well.
I think they made a mistake about your age.
Paper! Paper!
Paper! Paper!
Paper!
It's such an honor for Edinburgh, Sir Oliver.
I cannot take your money.
- Thank you.
- Paper! Paper!
Congratulations, Professor.
# Here's to the prof of geology
# Master of all natural history
# Rare boy he, and rare boys we
# To know such a big curiosity
# To the braw, aye, aye, aye, aye
# To the bricht, aye, aye, aye, aye
# To the knicht, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye
# Aye
I'm sorry.
Sir Oliver, since you have been created a knight,
I've given your students a holiday - a day for a knight, so to speak.
First, however, there's to be a presentation.
Will the Laird of Glendarach step forward?
Sir Oliver.
In the name of the student body, in gratitude for the knowledge you have imparted to us...
That's enough obituary prose.
An inkwell, I presume.
A very handsome thing.
Hellish to dust.
I thank you all from the bottom of my heart.
And now off to the playing fields, all of you!
Ah.
It cost £4.17. I was on the committee that made the collection.
- I thank you for your efforts, McEwen.
- £5 was subscribed. That left three shillings.
You're not going to give me the change, are you?
I expended it on this. A little extra token
I thought you might fancy.
I saw it during Easter week in a little window in Glasgow, a curiosity shop.
It seemed to whisper to me.
"Buy me for Professor Lindenbrook."
What did you reply?
I said "Only if you can be bought for three shillings."
- I argued with the owner all Good Friday.
- It's lava, of course.
But exceptionally heavy.
Could serve as a paperweight.
- Do you like it, Professor?
- It's a scholar's choice.
What are you eating tonight?
This being Tuesday, I'm not eating.
I find it very healthy to eat only every other night.
Be at my house at eight o'clock.
I'm entertaining some of the faculty.
- I do not think I could.
- What's the matter with you?
You used to come to my house regularly.
Is it those frayed cuffs that worry you?
I won't get my other shirt from the wash till Friday.
Eight o'clock sharp.
We're scientists, aren't we?
That's one society where frayed cuffs don't matter. We've all had 'em.
Yes, Sir Oliver. Eight o'clock.
Lava.
I swear there's something inside.
- There's Uncle now, Kirsty.
- And high time too!
I thought it was Uncle Oliver.
I want it understood that not a single stitch
I'm wearing belongs to me.
- Good evening, Miss Jenny.
- Good evening, Alec McEwen.
- I'm early, but I trust I'm not too early.
- I didn't know you were coming.
Well, your uncle - I should say Sir Oliver - ordered me to come.
Where is he? He's never been late like this - never.
I don't know, but, to return to the subject of my clothes, they're my classmate's, the young Laird of Glendarach.
"You can't go to dinner dressed like that" said the young laird.
"The professor knows my wardrobe"
I replied, and went to take my bath.
When I returned, my clothes had been confiscated and these substituted.
I want to make it clear I have no claim to the Glendarach tartan.
You've explained your magnificence.
Kirsty!
There will be one more guest.
- I'll seat you between the dean and the rector.
- Couldn't I sit next to you?
Certainly not.
Pardon my being personal, but I notice a certain harshness in your attitude toward me.
What do you expect when it takes a command from my uncle to bring you to this house?
Miss Jenny, why should I torture myself to no purpose?
Two years more I have to study for my master's degree.
Then four years more as a laboratory assistant.
There's the money I owe my relatives.
They're paying for my schooling.
You are very logical, Mr McEwen.
- It's the logic of an empty purse.
- How like a Scotsman.
I am a Scotsman.
I know one whose purse was not empty, because he didn't even have a purse.
His name was Robert Burns.
Do you know what he said?
Miss Jenny, the time of poetry is over.
If this is true, Alec McEwen, what are you doing with your hand on my knee?
Miss Jenny.
Now you just wait in there.
Kirsty, I'll set the extra place.
Is there something you want?
- A key is stuck.
- But that's impossible.
It was just tuned last month.
Which one?
- This one. Can't you see?
- No, I can't.
At least you can see how unhappy I am.
You know how I've felt since that day you entered the classroom and brought your uncle the galoshes he forgot.
You looked like spring itself.
# My love is like a red, red rose
# That's newly sprung in June
# My love is like the melody
# That's sweetly played in tune
I thought you were setting the table.
There's a key stuck. Mr McEwen is fixing it.
#... my bonny lass
# So deep in love am I
# That I will love you still, my dear
# Till all the seas go dry
# Till all the seas go dry, my love
# And rocks melt with the sun
# And I will love you still, my dear
# While the sands of life shall run
# So fare-thee-well, my only love
# And fare-thee-well a while
# For I'll come back to you, my love
# Though it were ten thousand mile
- Miss Jenny, you're crying.
- I've been over the goose... the fumes...
- Good evening, Miss Jenny.
- Good evening, gentlemen.
We were worrying about Professor Lindenbrook.
Yes, we were. Isn't he with you?
- Isn't he here?
- No.
- Careful it doesn't go too high, Paisley.
- It's just about the limit now, Sir Oliver.
I gave no permission for visitors.
Oh, it's you, McEwen.
- Good lad. You can lend Paisley a hand.
- Uncle, your guests are waiting.
If you don't come now, the goose will be...
- Oh, goose, goose, goose!
- Tell him, Alec.
This lava you gave me is one in ten million.
I've been at it all day.
- Aye, and without a pause for lunch or tea.
- You've had three semesters of petrology.
Now then, from which volcano could this piece of lava have emerged?
- Fujiyama?
- No.
- Mount Etna?
- Very close. The Mediterranean.
The Lipari island group off the coast of Italy.
- But theirs is a very light lava, sir.
- That's exactly what stumped me.
Inside there must be something the weight of the heaviest rock in existence.
- But that would be Icelandic peridotite.
- Precisely.
- There's a piece chipped off.
- By me.
- What's the rock inside?
- Icelandic peridotite, naturally.
When I saw this, I stopped chipping.
There's some marks on the surface.
Looks like a letter or some notches.
Three notches made by the hand of man.
But how could a rock from Iceland possibly pop out of a volcano across the world? What's your conclusion?
Science does notjump to conclusions.
Science is not a guessing game.
We're going to melt off the crust of lava.
Mr Paisley.
Add 10cc of aqua regia.
Not too fast, you know.
I shall write to Professor Goetaborg of Stockholm about this.
He's the leading authority on volcanoes.
How long is all this going to take?
A typically female question. To melt lava will take as long as it takes lava to melt.
- Maybe two hours, maybe four hours.
- Two hours? Four hours?
Maybe the whole night.
Who cares?
Jenny!
Are you all right?
That was entirely my fault, Sir Oliver.
I don't know how it could have happened.
Mr Paisley, by your slip you've rendered an inestimable service to science.
Alec.
See this? What would you call it?
As you said, it's a man-made object.
Looks like a top.
A surveyor's instrument. A plumb bob.
Not only looks like - it is a plumb bob.
- There are letters on it.
- It's an inscription. A message, perhaps.
Can you make out what it says, Professor?
It's in some Nordic tongue.
The hand that wrote this trembled.
Perhaps it was a dying hand.
I wonder what it's written in. Paint? Ink?
- Perhaps blood.
- Possibly.
Look at this side, sir. A signature.
Arne Saknus...
Arne Saknussem.
I hope it isn't too much to suggest that you take me home now, Uncle Oliver.
Or do I have to go alone?
Alone. Alone. It's unthinkable, but it must be true.
A man took some tools and went where no human being has ever set foot.
Alone. Into the interior of the earth, alone.
- What is he talking about?
- Arne Saknussem, the Icelandic scientist.
Greatest of his day. He was laughed at when he claimed there was a world down below.
The laughter stopped when he disappeared, never to be heard from.
Until tonight.
Get out of here, woman! I didn't ask for tea.
I don't want any tea! All I want is my post.
There's no use shouting at me, Sir Oliver.
I can shoutjust as loud as you can!
For two weeks you've had nothing to eat and you haven't slept!
Out, woman!
Here's your post, Uncle Oliver.
Another day and still nothing.
Can you believe that? No answer!
- Where is Alec McEwen?
- At the university, looking for letters there.
How long does it take for a letter to get here from Stockholm?
- Answer the bell.
- Did it ring?
We have to speak to Sir Oliver.
And don't tell us he's busy.
Callers, callers. That's all I need.
Oliver, we all know your reputation for rudeness.
You also have a reputation as a conscientious man.
But you've skipped every lecture in two weeks.
- I'm involved in something important.
- More important than our university?
Something any university would envy us.
You laugh. What does the name
Arne Saknussem mean to you, gentlemen?
Saknussem... Just a second.
Wasn't he the one who wrote about the lost city of Atlantis?
That was an early phase of his career.
His real fame rests on his study of volcanoes.
Out of a volcano came this message from him.
It lay unnoticed for 100 years, was probably picked up by some peasant, gathered dust in a curiosity shop till it came to me.
Here is a translation of the words.
"I am dying, but my life's work must not be lost."
"Whoever descends into the crater of Sneffels Yocul can reach the center of the earth.
I did it. Arne Saknussem."
- The center of the earth?
- Sneffels Yocul?
An extinct volcano in Iceland.
There must be a direct route from it to a region no man has ever seen.
But, Oliver, this is sheer fantasy.
You haven't heard all of it.
There's a postscript.
"At sunrise on the last day of May the mountain Scartaris will point the path."
- Well, what do you say now?
- I'm more mystified than ever.
- Scartaris?
- It's a mountain peak near the volcano.
But this is a student's hoax.
You should know better.
Just a second, Rector.
Let's not take that tone.
Let's assume it's authentic.
Isn't the correct procedure to write a paper and submit it to the university officially?
More than anything, you must consult other experts.
- A thing like this needs verification.
- Here is my paper.
And I've written to the foremost authority in Europe.
The Royal Geological Society?
More eminent still.
Professor Goetaborg of Stockholm.
And what does he say?
Unfortunately I've not yet received his reply.
And I've written to him twice.
I suggest we relax on the matter until your famous correspondent sees fit to answer you.
And in the meantime we could do with a cup of tea.
I know you two think I'm daft.
Think whatever you want!
Jenny, tea!
- When did you get here?
- Just this moment, Sir Oliver. Look.
It's from Stockholm!
Well, he's got his letter from Stockholm.
Did you see the shine in his eyes?
There'll never be a better moment to tell him about our feelings for each other.
- He'll say yes almost inadvertently.
- What if he says no advertently?
You wait and see how firm my voice can be when I speak of you.
Blast and damn!
Blast and damnation!
- The devil blast it!
- What is it, Oliver?
- Don't keep us in the dark.
- Bad news, sir?
I am stricken. The University of Stockholm informs me that Professor Goetaborg has vanished from Sweden.
His disappearance follows closely the date my communication must have reached him.
With all my material.
He evidently didn't think it important enough to answer.
Or too important.
McEwen, go directly to the harbor. Find out when the next ship leaves for Iceland.
- Oliver, calm down.
- I will not be beaten to my goal.
- But what is your goal?
- You heard Saknussem's message.
- Oliver, you're seriously ill.
- I am seriously well.
What are you waiting for? I told you to hurry.
If you'll excuse me, I must start packing.
- To go where?
- To Iceland to begin with.
- And then?
- Where Arne Saknussem went.
- Oliver!
- Will you kindly stop saying Oliver.
I can't sit in my classrooms waiting, while a scoundrel named Goetaborg exploits what I foolishly placed in his hands.
Don't you see what's at stake? The ultimate aim of all science: To penetrate the unknown.
Do you realize we know less about the earth we live on than about the stars and the galaxies of outer space?
The greatest mystery is right here, right under our feet.
And now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen...
- I must have a word with you.
- I've no time.
- You must take time for this, sir.
- What are you so urgent about?
- This is the most urgent moment of my life.
- Not for me. I have to be in Iceland.
So must I. I'm going with you, sir.
- Where?
- To the center of the earth, naturally.
# My heart's in the Highlands
# A-chasing the deer
# A-hunting the wild deer
# And chasing the roe
# My heart's in the Highlands
# Wherever I go
Right now all Iceland must be aware that the Scots have arrived.
I wish I could sing loud enough for Jenny to hear me.
Homesick already?
It is a bit painful to leave her on the first day of our engagement.
To come back to her as a world-famous scientist is not to be sneezed at.
Come here. Take a look.
Did you expect a flight of stairs with a red carpet?
I neglected to tell you, sir.
I have a nervous fear of heights.
Well, you'll get over that after the first million fathoms or so.
Million fathoms...
Alec, he's been here.
He's been surveying here.
This is fresh-cut wood.
- Your revered colleague from Stockholm.
- He isn't wasting any time.
- Do you think he's already gone down?
- No. The message said the last day of May.
Take our carriage to Reykjavik.
Buy all the rope available.
Stock up on hardtacks, salted beef, chocolate, and all the medical supplies we need, but more than anything inquire whether they have Ruhmkorff lamps.
Have another carriage waiting for me at sunset.
- You think we can prepare it all so quickly?
- We must. We're in a race.
What's that you're taking?
Jenny's farewell gift.
I'll keep it with me always.
Scartaris.
- Back to my hotel.
- Já, Professor Goetaborg.
My good man.
I assume my assistant sent you.
No, no, thank you.
Nobody carries a soldier's weapons.
And take your time.
These instruments are delicate.
Easy, coachman.
This isn't the same road we came by this morning. I said slow down, man!
You're out of your senses! Stop your horses, man! This is not a request, it's a command!
Can't you hear me? Slow down!
Stop, you fool!
Whoa!
If you've ruined my instruments,
I'll horsewhip you, so help me.
And where are we?
This certainly is not my hotel.
- Professor!
- Alec!
Where are we?
Apparently in an eider-feather storehouse.
- How did you get here?
- I don't know. It went so fast.
I was clubbed. I was overpowered before I knew there was a struggle.
- Did you see who did it?
- No. I was just trying to do your errands.
I said Professor Goetaborg was a scoundrel.
He's a criminal.
Very likely he's dreamed of such a project.
Your letter was the key to the door of fame.
- Hush. Did you hear that?
- What?
Some tapping.
Don't get your hopes up, Professor.
There's not a soul around.
- Everybody is in the market square.
- Why? It isn't Sunday.
The fishing fleet is going out for the first summer haul.
- You mean the shops are closed?
- No, the shops are open.
But every piece of rope, every lamp, everything we'd need was sold.
To Professor Goetaborg.
He's staying in the very inn where we have our rooms.
This time I heard it too.
- A fellow prisoner, do you suppose?
- Let's give it a signal, sir.
- It's a code.
- Morse?
I can'tjust make it out. Jot this down.
Dash, dash, dot, dot, dot, dot, long dash...
- It doesn't make sense.
- Perhaps it's in Icelandic.
I don't think so.
We've established contact.
I still can't make it out.
My esteemed friend, whoever you are, let me introduce myself.
Professor Oliver Lindenbrook,
University of Edinburgh.
May I ask you to interrupt your tapping for a moment and listen?
In what language would you like me to speak?
- He doesn't understand English.
- I'll try French.
Mon cher ami, vous et nous sommes dans une situation abominable.
It's no good, sir. It sounds more Russian.
Gertrude?
Gertrude! Gertrude!
- It's a female prisoner.
- And her lover.
Professor, they're kissing.
I'm sorry, but for once we must dispense with tact.
Much as I regret to disturb this tender moment, is there any way you can get us out of here?
It's a duck!
And I was just about to try Latin!
Young man with the gold tooth, I'll give you more gold if you'll guide us to Reykjavik.
You take us to Reykjavik.
I understand that Professor Goetaborg from Stockholm is stopping here, a friend of mine.
- A friend of yours? Professor Goetaborg?
- Let's say a colleague.
May I have your help?
- He is at home, isn't he?
- Yes, I...
He is not at home. He is not to be disturbed.
- Don't tell me he's asleep with this going on.
- You cannot see him. I'm sorry.
Here are your coins. And here is my card, if you'll be good enough to put it in his box so that he'll know tomorrow that I'm around.
Thank you so much.
Goetaborg! I know you're in there.
Open up. This is Lindenbrook.
Goetaborg.
Do you see what this is, laddie?
The very last word in equipment.
Ruhmkorff lamps.
Self-generating.
- How long will they burn?
- My guess is indefinitely.
As long as they're wound up, the induction coil will give off current.
Breathing devices.
The kind they use in coal mines in Wales.
All the instruments needed for exploring the world below, whatever it may be.
I shall wait here till Goetaborg returns.
You wait too.
Goetaborg may be a strong man.
More treasure, sir. Climbing boots.
Alpenstocks.
Blankets.
Food for months.
A chart of the...
Professor!
What?
Well, Goetaborg, it seems there's such a thing as justice after all.
So you wanted to push in ahead of us.
Fate took care of him.
Why didn't they tell us at the desk?
Hotels rarely advertise the fact that there are corpses lying around.
The Icelander teaches us a lesson.
All right. We'll observe one minute of silence in memory of a great scientist, even if he was a blasted thief.
Alec, you mentioned fate. Slight correction.
Fate plus a few grains of potassium cyanide.
He was against someone who was even more against him.
Who?
I'm the wife of Professor Goetaborg.
- Oh, my dear.
- What is it?
I was surprised my husband wasn't at the pier to meet me. Is something wrong?
Won't you sit down for a minute before you go up?
Please, my dear.
He seemed so well. Early in the morning he went to the mountain.
When he came back for lunch he received his guest right in the lobby. I saw him myself.
They went up to his room and ate.
What are you trying to tell me?
That my husband is?
His guest left about four.
In the evening when the maid went to make the bed...
Oh, dear God! As long as I can remember, no one ever died in my inn!
Of course, we called a doctor, but it was too late.
We left him up there because we knew you were due in on the morning boat.
Just ten days ago he was... he was joking on the pier in Stockholm.
The moment he arrived here he sent me a message, just with one word: "Come."
Madam, my deep sympathy.
My name - Oliver Lindenbrook of Edinburgh University.
I take it you're familiar with that name.
- Professor Lindenbrook.
- I see you are.
I must ask you a question, and it's just as well that Madam Goetaborg be present.
This will be difficult for you, madam, but it must be faced.
Who was the last person to see him alive?
His luncheon guest.
- And who was that?
- Count Saknussem.
Count Saknussem? I didn't realize the Saknussem family still existed.
The Saknussems are the oldest family in this whole land.
A descendant of Arne Saknussem?
And a scientist too in his own right.
And it was he who lunched with Professor Goetaborg?
They saw each other every day.
They worked together in his room with all those charts and instruments.
I suggest that you have an autopsy performed immediately.
You think there's something suspicious about my husband's death?
Your husband came to Iceland for the same reasons that brought me.
Neither he nor I could suspect there was a third party who would stop at nothing to forestall us.
He was... killed?
Poisoned.
This is now a matter for the police.
Go and send for them at once.
To your room first, madam.
Just one second, if you please. Thank you.
I am deeply distressed by your husband's death, and I fully understand your feelings.
However, I must ask you one question.
How do you plan to dispose of the equipment your husband assembled up there?
- What does it matter now?
- Don't give it another thought.
- I'll take it off your hands.
- We can discuss it later.
No, we cannot discuss it later, madam.
Time is running out.
My expedition must start within the next 24 hours.
- Your expedition?
- Exactly.
I only know of the Goetaborg Expedition.
Husbands don't tell their wives everything.
I do not wish to blacken the memory of your husband, but as I'm under pressure,
I must change my request to a demand.
I have a right to that equipment and I claim it.
A right? To take over the work of another man's lifetime?
- He died for that idea.
- An idea he stole from me.
- That is a lie.
- Madam...
An unforgivable lie!
I would rather destroy every pound of that equipment than let you have it.
"Incredible encounter."
"A Saknussem descendant turns up - acts as if he were King of Volcanoes."
"Tries to force me to surrender his ancestor's secret."
"Saknussem called again."
"New complication.
My real adversary arrives: Lindenbrook."
"Undoubtedly to claim his rights.
Must fight him somehow."
Young man, would you come here a moment, please?
Who are those for?
Professor Lindenbrook.
- Oh. At least we have some rope.
- That's a beginning.
Tell him to stop jabbering and go for some more shopping.
What about lamps?
Lamps. Lamps.
What about picks?
And provisions. Food.
What are you doing? What are you doing?
Put me down! Put me down!
Kindly put me down! Put me down!
Will somebody please explain this outrage?
Are we to be abducted every day in Iceland?
- She speaks Icelandic.
- I do.
But I wish to apologize to you in plain English.
I went through my husband's diary, and some of his remarks led me to believe I did you an injustice.
- I'm sorry. I didn't know.
- Don't give it another thought. I shan't.
I'm Sir Oliver's assistant, Alec McEwen.
This whole expedition began, thanks to this lad.
Began - and that's all it has done.
Sir Oliver, this morning you asked me for these.
If you still want them, they're yours.
Will you say that again?
I shall not stand in the way of the Lindenbrook Expedition.
Madam.
My husband had these boots made specially. I hope they fit you.
Mine will be ready without delay. I told your man to order some for me immediately.
Good, good.
What was that?
Why would you need boots like this?
Well, I can't very well go in these.
- Go where, madam?
- Don't say it.
Naturally, I'm coming along.
That's why I'm giving you all of this.
- It's a condition. I thought you understood.
- You didn't mention any condition.
Then I do now. Whom did you intend to take along, besides this young man?
- The big Icelander.
- Then I'll be very useful.
- He doesn't understand a word of English.
- You can't come along! You're a woman!
And what has my sex to do with it?
We're not contemplating a stroll down Piccadilly or the Champs Élysées.
Professor Lindenbrook,
I have just lost my husband.
I have nothing else to live for any more up here.
- Down there I can represent his name.
- The decision is not yours to make.
The police require your presence for the investigation into the death.
I have already given my testimony.
But, madam, quite apart from the appalling danger, think of the inconvenience.
The lack of privacy.
In short, you don't want all of this.
I may be mad on the subject of this journey, but I am not stupid!
To burden myself with a female is sheer stupidity!
I resent that word. I may have been a disturbance to men, never a burden.
This is an absolute holdup!
You will not receive one iota of extra consideration.
You'll sleep where we sleep, eat what we eat and wash when we wash.
Then you accept my proposition.
Professor, look!
There's our gateway!
Thank you, Scartaris!
Never was there a brighter sunrise.
Now we descend into oblivion or... we enter the great book of history.
Roll call.
Carla Goetaborg.
- Alexander McEwen.
- Hans and Gertrude Belker.
Oliver S Lindenbrook.
What did he say? Hans and who?
And Gertrude.
Professor!
Professor!
All right, you've arrived.
- Rather an alarming descent.
- I found it exhilarating.
I wonder if Madam Goetaborg will change her mind.
You make my mouth water.
- Hans is tying the rope on her.
- I'm a fool.
I should have told him to tie her to a mule and send her back where she belongs.
In what language would you have told him that?
All right, she may be of some use in that respect.
And then there's always the blessed chance the rope may break.
- Are you all right, ma'am?
- Quite.
Hans insisted on a double rope, you see.
- Did he indeed? How solicitous.
- But that was for Gertrude.
Poor Sir Oliver, stuck with a woman.
If only you could see your face.
That's my consolation, madam.
I don't have to look at it. You do.
- There isn't enough rope in all Europe.
- Perhaps this is the wrong entrance.
The sign was unmistakable.
But there's no other way to continue.
Gertrude!
Gertrude!
He says there's a tunnel on the other side... slanting downhill but walkable.
Eureka!
Thank you.
Now then, a general summary.
A: We must never use more than two Ruhmkorff lamps at a time.
B: We will not be needing our breathing equipment for a long stretch.
Nevertheless, none of us must ever take a step without it.
C: Use canteens freely for now. There'll be plenty of mineral springs on our way.
As my husband's charts indicated.
Is Professor Goetaborg to be with us on our entire journey, madam?
Sorry.
Well, every journey begins with a first step.
May the good Lord be with us.
Onward.
And let's have some music.
Alec, will you start us off?
Miss Jenny.
I saw you turn pale when the dominie spoke of those in peril at the far ends of the earth.
The far ends of the earth - at least that would be somewhere.
There was a clipping in a Stockholm paper.
A dispatch from Reykjavik.
- I can only read their names.
- I had it translated.
The last news was that they went up Mount
Sneffels with some heavily laden donkeys.
Yes?
And then the animals came down without their packs.
- And?
- And that's all.
Oliver S Lindenbrook, Alexander McEwen,
Hans Belker and... Madam...
- What's it?
- It seems a woman went with them.
A woman!
You know what they'll call that in the Royal Observatory at Greenwich?
A slight tremor, coming from undefined regions.
Well, we've lived through a slight tremor. Let us proceed.
It seems to be moving away from us.
Madam, in these regions I'd never venture to say that anything is moving away - or coming towards us.
The only thing we can be certain of is that danger is always with us.
We might as well ignore it.
Run!
Jump!
The three notches.
The three notches of Arne Saknussem.
- What does that mean?
- We've been shown the right path.
Alec, the plumb bob.
Look. Without these marks, we would have gone astray.
We'd have wasted months exploring endlessly.
We might have taken any one of these channels.
But our great colleague maketh a path for our feet.
Well, you all deserve a rest. Let us have tea.
With a double ration of raisins.
May I comb my hair first, Professor?
Ladies on the left, gentlemen on the right.
What is it, madam?
If we'd known that you had nightmares, we'd have made different sleeping arrangements.
Someone is walking up there.
I heard footsteps. Human footsteps.
Madam, since the beginning of time all women have heard footsteps up there.
My hearing is extremely acute.
The hearing of all women is extremely acute.
My wife used to hear rats in the attic, usually the nights before I had an important lecture.
I used to go up, armed with a broom.
Alec, go up and find out. Hans.
Madam, will you leave those men alone?
They need rest.
Moreover, it was stipulated that I give the orders.
There's no need to use that patient voice with me.
Would you rather I used an impatient voice?
Professor Lindenbrook,
I am a member of this expedition, and as such I intend to report any observation I make.
Alec.
Put it down in the record that a member of the expedition reported... rats in the attic.
Lights out.
Don't be afraid, madam.
I'm right here.
Conceal these marks completely.
I'll give them some new ones.
This is steeper than anything we've encountered.
It's just as well we all had a good night's rest.
Alec, take this down.
"21st day of our descent."
"Starting from an estimated depth of 129km, limestone formation continues."
Kai-ai, Professor.
Here are the three notches again.
Good.
- Gertrude, wrong turn.
- Let's see. What have we here?
One heads 220º south-southwest, the other 160º south-southeast.
Strange. I would have wagered we'd have to bear in that direction.
That was Gertrude's feeling too.
Are you sure your compass is right?
Quite.
What's he saying?
Hans is wondering about the ultimate goal of our expedition.
- He's asking why.
- Alec, suppose you tell him.
Well, why does man freeze to death trying to reach the North Pole?
Why does man drive himself to suffer the steam and heat of the Amazon?
Why does he stagger his mind with the mathematics of the sky?
Once a question has arisen in the human brain, the answer must be found if it takes 100 years. 1,000 years.
Let's hear you render that into a few well-chosen Icelandic words.
Why not simply tell him scientists have bats in their belfries?
Are you all right? Can you unhook yourself?
Hans.
- Grab his hand.
- I didn't see it.
Never mind about that.
How is it possible?
This way was clearly indicated.
There must have been a quake since Arne Saknussem's day.
This is no recent fissure. This has been here since the beginning of time.
I was not in a position to observe it scientifically.
We've made a mistake somewhere. But where?
What are you doing here?
We're supposed to stay together.
And we must never have more than two lamps.
We've been tricked.
Tricked into the wrong tunnel.
Those three notches are not Arne Saknussem's.
She's right, Professor.
Someone has passed through before us.
No need to ask who.
Madam... heard him last night.
Now she's saying "I told you so."
Silently, I admit, but she's saying it.
When I wish to say something,
Professor, I say it - aloud.
Due to this development, I have no choice but to break up the expedition.
- We must return.
- Why?
You don't strike me as a man who frightens easily.
I'm not thinking of myself. You know that.
- I must think of you, a woman.
- We agreed I was to be one of your men.
- But if there is a madman loose...
- He's against all of us.
Against the very concept of this journey.
What's happened? What's he saying?
He said we should go back to where Alec fell.
But it's not on our route. If we're to go ahead, we have no time for detours.
Then you wait here.
If only my Jenny were here to see this.
Madam, now that the boy has gone and Hans doesn't understand English,
I must ask rather a delicate question.
I'm blushing already.
You're wearing... stays, are you not?
Professor!
Yes, I thought so.
I can hear them creaking as you walk along.
What I wear is not your business.
Everything is my business. We'll look the other way while you discard them.
Professor, you go too far.
We're approaching regions of excessive heat.
Nothing must impede anyone's breathing in any way.
Alec! Leaving in a few minutes!
I've got to take a specimen of this back to Edinburgh, if it's the last thing I do.
Unique. Inexplicable.
All right, ready to go, if that boy Alec would be good enough to appear.
Where the devil is he?
It's a blind alley!
Keep back!
Professor!
Hans!
Good God!
Hold on. Hold on to my arm... my shoulder!
Little bit... Hold on. That's it.
Praise the Lord!
Alec.
Professor!
Hello! Hello!
Professor! Professor! Here I am!
Salt.
Alec!
Alec!
Professor.
Professor, you can't go on this way.
I've kept track of the passage of days.
- You haven't.
- We'll try the cross-channel over there.
We were in that channel yesterday.
We left marks.
- You won't find him there.
- I've got to find him. I'm responsible.
Look.
No need to translate.
I can see that this is a recent break.
Alec!
Can you hear me?
If you're down there, give us a sign!
Alec, listen carefully. When the echoes stop, you must try to answer.
If you're injured, if you can't talk, make an effort.
Pick up a pebble and scratch the rock.
We'll hear you, I promise you.
Just give us a sign.
A phosphorescent pool.
A strange grave for a young Scot.
Professor, there's no use.
How can I live with myself?
Accept his loss, like one soldier accepts the loss of another soldier.
You must continue with what you started.
You must go on with the Lindenbrook Expedition.
- The Lindenbrook Expedition!
- Yes. Go on with it.
It was his project as much as it was yours.
Yes, you're right.
We will proceed. But we won't call it the Lindenbrook Expedition any more.
From now on it's the Alec McEwen Expedition.
No broken bones? Ribs all right?
Good. Get up.
Down there, food and water. Refresh yourself.
So you've lost your friends? Just as well.
It's my servant.
Too much heat, too much load... too much fear.
You're younger. You'll do to carry my things.
I'm not your servant, Count Saknussem.
Pride? Rather out of place here. Eat, drink, then pick up those things. I'm in a hurry.
- To steal the professor's project?
- Steal?
Listen, young foreigner,
I don't have to steal what belongs to me.
You're in my world now.
Stop. I need someone to carry my equipment.
You will never find your companions or your way out. You need me as much as I need you.
You found me. My friends could find me too.
Very well. You'll carry it with one arm, not two!
- A hail of bullets.
- No, no.
It's a multiple echo, reverberating through the rock chambers.
The last echo will give us the direction.
166º south-southeast.
Alec. Alec.
Alec. Alec!
We'd given you up, but you're alive, laddie.
You're alive!
Professor.
Hans.
Just to see you...
Where was he?
I... I didn't think he'd shoot, but he did.
Of course I did. What did you expect?
You are trespassers here.
I am the owner of this domain.
You are also the murderer of my husband.
I claimed my rights. He would not listen.
Count Saknussem, in the name of your great ancestor, put down that preposterous gun.
No harm will come of it if you accept my terms.
You will go back the way you came, but you will leave the equipment I need and that man.
You're not going to listen to a murderer?
Never interrupt a murderer, madam.
I resent that bourgeois classification.
I'll spare your lives.
You have my word of honor.
Give me your hand on that.
A bourgeois trick.
So sorry.
Now then, before we continue on our journey, we must perform a solemn duty.
We have to hold court.
Here, hundreds of kilometers beneath the surface of the earth, we are the law.
The defendant stands accused of one murder and one act of mayhem.
To preserve legal formalities
I must ask you, as jurors, is the defendant guilty or not guilty?
Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Then the mandatory sentence is death.
There are two bullets left. Madam, will you be good enough to explain to Hans?
We will follow the route marked by the notches.
He is to wait here for ten minutes, then carry out the sentence.
- No, no, no, no, no.
- I can carry something with my left hand.
You can carry yourself for a couple of days.
That's all we can expect.
Sir Oliver, there's a slight problem.
Our friend Hans refuses to shoot the count.
What do you mean, "refuses"?
It's a court order.
It seems his family have been loyal to the Saknussems for generations and, well, he cannot touch the gun.
This is contempt of court.
- All right, Alec.
- No, no, Professor... I mean, Sir Oliver.
You mustn't look at me. I, um...
I couldn't pull the trigger with my left hand.
Oh, no. You... you couldn't consider for a moment that I could do it.
- After all, I'm a woman.
- I see.
For weeks you've been denying your sex, and now you fall back on it.
I would say the natural executioner would be the leader of the expedition.
We must face the truth, sir.
We're much too civilized to... to do away with a fellow human being.
What do you propose? Drag him with us?
Feed him? Let him share our glory?
Stop fiddling with those lamps.
What's he jabbering about?
I'll tell you what he's saying.
The lamps are giving out.
And I'll give you the reason. The induction coils have been corroded by the salt.
To save what we can, I insist that we leave these regions at once.
You insist?!
As a matter of fact, he's bloody well right. Let's be off.
You realize Saknussem's unfastened himself from the rope again and gone off?
What's the harm?
He'll be back when it's time to eat.
The harm is, madam, that he's wasting a lamp.
Madam, will you try your lamp, please?
- It's dead.
- Yours, Alec?
When these things are gone, they're really gone.
Madam, make a final note, while you've still light enough to write by.
- Let me, madam. My arm's quite well now.
- No need.
"We've covered another 92km."
"Temperature dropped seven degrees."
"It's surprisingly cooler than anticipated... but darkness is closing about us."
"This may be our last entry."
Hans and I can cut some rope into some torches.
That's a good idea. What puzzles me is that the three notches of old Arne Saknussem still keep pointing our way.
What kind of a lamp did he have?
Perhaps my ancestor did not require a lamp.
From here on neither do you, Sir Oliver.
Why don't you turn it off?
Yes, just switch it off.
Why, it's miraculous!
Look at this.
What is it, sir?
A form of algae with the property of luminescence.
Light without heat. A cool, chemical light.
You've seen fireflies, madam, and glowworms, and forms of life in the sea that generate their own light.
The same principle is involved here.
"256th day."
"The phenomenal winds vanished as abruptly as they came."
"We are now in a stupendous deposit of cinnabar."
What's that curious mark you make on every page?
ME. McEwen Expedition.
So whenever I've said
Lindenbrook Expedition, you've written McEwen Expedition?
May I remind you that months ago you gave me explicit orders to that effect?
You may not remind me! I do not wish to be corrected by you incessantly.
Is that what I'm doing?
You're doing it with your looks, the inflection of your voice, the very posture of your body.
Your entire presence is a constant criticism of me.
I'm tired of it. I've had enough.
You've had enough.
Well, let me tell you, you dried-up walnut of a man, if anyone's had enough, it's me.
- It's I.
- It's I, it's me!
It's Carla Goetaborg! I quit! I am leaving!
May I send for madam's horse and carriage?
Well...
Well, at least you know I have a temper.
And from now on Alec will keep the charts.
Alec! Alec!
Why can't he stay around?
Kai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai!
Mushrooms! A forest of mushrooms!
They may be hundreds of years old, but the small ones we can eat! They're delicious.
To think they grew without sun this far under the earth!
All the food we can eat!
It's tougher than leather.
We'll have new soles for our shoes.
It's like an oak tree.
Madam, you're magnificent. Mushroom steak, mushroom soup, mushroom hash.
Let me say this. If we'd had one more week of that salted beef, I would have perished.
Don't be too happy.
After some months of this, you'll be smacking your lips at the thought of salt beef.
Yes, months, months.
If we only knew how many more.
There's no term to the work of a scientist.
Let me say this, madam.
If you hadn't been along, this whole journey would have been unbearable.
But that's not
Professor Lindenbrook's feeling.
It's mine.
You see, we have no sun, no moon and no stars.
But then you're here.
And what is the name of the girl you love?
- I beg your pardon?
- The girl you love?
- What's her name?
- Jenny.
But why would you want to know thatjust now?
Dear Alec! There are times when it's advisable to jog a young man's memory.
Professor?
Here's some hot mushroom porridge for you, Sir Oliver.
I slept as I never slept in Edinburgh.
No street noises, no church bells, no clatter of pans from the kitchen.
I may move here permanently.
What's our large friend doing over there?
I don't know.
Special command of His Majesty.
Is that madman still giving orders?
This is supposed to be his rest period.
The minute you fell asleep he went off in that direction, through the tunnel.
He came back long enough to order the felling of the mushrooms.
What in the world can he want with all those?
You've come to ask me why I didn't take my rest period.
I don't sleep. I hate those little slices of death.
- It's a sea.
- It's an ocean with waves and currents.
The ocean of the underworld.
Some earthquake, before the beginning of history, cracked wide open the great sea and through the fissures poured this.
The fissures closed again.
No map ever recorded the Saknussem Ocean.
I so christened it while you were asleep.
It's the prerogative of the discoverer.
I congratulate you.
You realize, Lindenbrook, that from now on there will be no notches to follow.
That's why you ordered a raft. I approve.
A dimetrodon!
If I had my gun, we'd have fresh meat for dinner.
That's what he's seen. He's a flesh eater.
- Can he swim?
- No, thank God.
The wind blowing down the high street!
Here.
I brought you some nice apples.
- I wonder if it's cold where they are.
- Where they are. Indeed.
Are they anyplace?
McEwen, put that toy away and take over the rudder.
Yes, sir.
- I didn't tell you to throw it away.
- It flew out of my hand!
My watch!
- Save the instruments.
- What's happening?
My ring! My wedding ring.
A field of force that snatches gold away.
This is it! This is it!
The junction of magnetic forces from the North Pole and South Pole!
The center of the earth!
Hang on!
Hold on to your rope!
No!
Is everyone here?
Madam Goetaborg,
Alec, Hans.
Gertrude.
And His Highness over there.
So... the expedition with all the names... ends like this.
We're alive, aren't we?
After all, we did hit the center of the earth.
It hit us, laddie.
No need to tell us, madam.
He wants to know where we go from here.
Tired minds don't plan well.
Sleep first, plan later.
When I refused to eat my porridge when I was a boy, my mother - like all mothers - used to say
"Oliver, the day may come when you'd very much like to have that porridge."
Why do you look so surprised? Is it incredible to you that I ever had a mother?
I was just thinking how proud she'd be of that little boy who wouldn't eat his porridge.
Here, duck.
Here, duck.
Gertrude?
Gertrude?
Gertrude?
Gertrude!
Gertrude!
Gertrude! Gertrude!
Gertrude!
Hans! Hans!
Why do you look at me like that?
Hans!
I needed food, so I took it.
Professor, tell your man to calm himself.
I'm not in the mood to engage in a dispute about a slaughtered duck.
Professor, stop him! Stop this fool!
- Hans!
- Hans!
You ingrates! What can you do without me?
Only I can show you the way out of this realm of mine.
Look out!
This is the sunken city.
After 5,000 years, behold a fragment of the lost Atlantis.
All we know about it comes from the Greek.
The floor of the sea opened up and swallowed the whole island of Atlantis.
This must have been the market square.
Professor. Professor, this looks like some sort of inn.
It is an inn. An eating place, certainly.
"Eating." What a word.
What a wonderful word.
Well, we've learned one thing about the inhabitants of Atlantis.
They ate oysters.
Stale bread. We must speak to the baker.
Madam! Madam!
Já?
- He's asking if that was a temple to their god.
- Yes, I'm sure it is.
It's some sort of altar stone where the sacred flame burned.
- It's serpentine, isn't it?
- Exactly. A massive form of asbestos.
To think that at a moment like this
I've no pad and pencil to record it all.
Turn around, madam. Don't look.
What is it?
The great Arne Saknussem, I presume.
So this is as far as you came.
What's the matter with you two?
Say "how do you do" to a brave man.
He must have dragged himself here with a broken leg. Look at that tibia.
- You won't find anything edible in there.
- Why not?
The Chinese eat eggs over 400 years old.
Gunpowder.
Professor, look at his right hand.
It's pointing somewhere.
To that shaft over there.
Of course! Of course!
This is what the pointing finger meant!
This is the way up.
He couldn't make it, but we can!
This is the volcanic chimney.
The violent updraft can mean only one thing:
A direct hatchway to the surface.
- And we can climb up.
- Madam, explain to Hans.
Let him venture 100 meters or so on reconnoiter.
The updraft can't carry him away.
Now I'd say let's roll up our sleeves - if we had any.
We mustn't hope for much.
This light won't stay with us.
- We'll have to provide some kind of light.
- And food.
I'll go see what I can find.
I'll comb every inch of Atlantis.
If we only had some shears, we could cut it off.
Could we?
Kai-ai! Kai-ai!
Kai-ai! Kai-ai!
Flints! I've found some flints.
Good lad. We won't be walking in darkness.
I wish I had better news. It gives every indication of being a perfect passage upward, straighter than the one we descended.
- But...
- But? But?
There's an obstacle. A gigantic block of stone obstructs the passageway.
Hans said only a landslide could ever move it.
No, let him be.
If his hopes hadn't been so high...
- Alec!
- Yes, sir?
The haversack -
Arne Saknussem's haversack. Get it.
If God is with us and that gunpowder has kept its ginger over the years, we'll make that landslide ourselves.
Now, my wonderful companions, you realize, I hope, that we're taking an enormous chance.
But it's our only chance.
I guarantee that this'll blow up the obstructing rock.
Whether the surrounding rocks will take the disturbance lightly, I cannot guarantee.
Let's get what protection we can.
Into the altar stone.
Dear God, ruler of heaven and earth...
Don't set any limit to his realm, laddie.
God of the universe, we are in thy merciful hands.
- Look out!
- Run, Professor! A monster!
Let me go!
We've started an earthquake!
The lava is pushing us up!
- It's an earthquake of unusual magnitude!
- More likely it's a volcanic eruption.
Listen to this. "Stromboli, Italy.
First eyewitness report."
"The capsule of the dead volcano broke under a tremendous explosion."
"Rocks of extraordinary size are being spewed out into the sea."
Dammi una mano.
Piano. Piano.
- Passami il vino.
- Ecco.
Signora, beva, beva.
Where's Alec?
Hans says... Alec was thrown from the altar stone... long before we hit the water.
Non si preoccupi. Abbiamo uno scalino.
I'm most grateful, ladies, but my immediate need is not a ladder.
I need trousers. Pants.
Pantaloons. Pantaloons.
- Vuole i pantaloni.
- Pantaloni.
Don't bring them yourselves.
Send a friar, a monk.
Excuse me, ladies.
Excuse me.
Lindenbrook! Lindenbrook!
Speech! Speech!
Fellow Scots, if these shouts of yours express some pleasure that we've returned alive, I thank you deeply.
However, if they're meant as praise for a successful scientist,
I must disclaim that honor.
No. A scientist who cannot prove what he has accomplished has accomplished nothing.
I have no records, no shred of evidence.
I will never embarrass this distinguished university by asking that it take my word.
Let me say only this.
300 years ago a daring man undertook a perilous journey and never came back.
We followed his path and returned, by the grace of God - and a heathen altar stone.
One day someone else - it may be you, my boy, or your sons or your grandsons - will pick up where we left off.
This, I know: The spirit of man cannot be stopped.
Splendid, Oliver. Splendid speech.
Professor, here's someone who wants to say goodbye.
His ship sails at four.
Hans, old friend.
We never could have done without you.
He has a speech.
If you... if you will ever go down there again, the center earth, Hans will go too.
Thank you.
Did you get your injuries when the volcano blew up, in the hot lava?
No, it happened at our wedding.
He was in such a hurry leaving the church, he fell all the way down the steps.
You poor wee bride. After all that waiting.
It's been no marriage for you at all.
You underestimate Alec.
I'm taking the night train to London and then back to Stockholm.
Stockholm? But you have ajob to do here in Edinburgh.
- I?
- I intend to write my memoirs.
I can't remember everything that happened alone.
Oh, I see. What you need is a widow who can jog your memory and take dictation.
I suppose I'm to report every day from nine till twelve, from two to six?
No, none of that nonsense.
You can stay in my house.
And what would Edinburgh say?
It's one thing to spend one's days and nights with a man under the earth, another under one roof in Scotland.
Well, uh... what do you propose?
That's not a word I'd bandy about, Professor.
What did I say? Which word?
I thought it would catch in your throat.
Madam. Madam.
Thank you. Madam Goetaborg.
Frau Goetaborg!
Carla!
Yes... Oliver?
Carla...
I warn you...
I'm wearing stays again.

MIRACLE IN MILAN
Once upon a time...
Good morning.
What a great big place the world is!
- What's seven times seven?
- And six times six?
Three times three?
Shall we go now, little boy?
Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Who are you saying hello to?
- To you.
- To me?
- Yes.
- Do you know me?
No.
So what do you mean by saying "Hello"?
- I really just wanted to say "Hello".
- Go and take a running jump!
That's all I need a retard first thing in the morning-..
Excuse me, have you got a job for me?
No.
Excuse me, but that's mine.
- It's yours?
- Yes.
- There's hardly anything in it.
- But I rather liked the case.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
- 'Night.
- 'Night.
Do you know where I could get a bed for the night?
You'll have to go to the town centre.
But the last tram's just left.
I could put you up at my house if you want.
- Thanks
- Okay, then. Let's go.
- Th-th-thanks a lot.
- You're welcome.
You've b-b-been very kind.
I don't know how to thank you enough.
There's really no need.
The sun! The sun!
Quick, come on!
Lovely, isn't it?
Kick him out!
Move! Don't push!
Stamp your feet.
Clean your nose!
- Come on in!
- I'm not cold. I've got underwear.
Look! The sun!
How selfish can you get!
He wants it all for himself.
Jesus wept!
Come on, Angelina.
Come on! Up you get!
Jump up! Run!
Peek-a-boo! Stamp your feet.
Come on! Come over here!
Peek-a-boo! Stamp your feet.
All we need's a shack
to live and sleep in.
Angela, what's five times five?
- Angela, what have you done?
- Eh...
And you. What's three times three?
- Hello!
- Hello!
Get the paint.
Look. It's over there.
What are you doing?
This way at least the children will learn something.
- Can I help?
- Yes, of course! Come over here!
Thanks.
One Times One Square...
This is a vacuum cleaner.
Come on, lads! To work!
Work ennobles man.
And makes men rich.
- Look at that beautiful statue!
- Really lovely!
- She's mine! I saw her first!
- No, it isn't.
- I found it. It's mine.
- Where was I then?
Nowhere.
I saw it first, so it's mine.
Leave it out!
What do you mean you saw it first?
Get your hands off me.
I said it's mine!
What do you mean it's yours?
- I said I saw it first.
- You didn't see anything.
- Excuse me. I saw it first.
- Clear off, you!
The statue's mine!
I'll give you statue.
One second!
- What is it?
- Blow.
- Eh?
- Like this.
Oh, clear off home.
Oh, who cares. You keep the statues and the rest of the rubbish, too.
Come on!
Beautiful, eh?
- Marvellous!
- Take it along to the square.
- Please hammer this in for me?
- Okay. You fix this.
- I'd give an arm and a leg to be as tall as you.
I'm not that tall.
I just look it.
- I'd give an arm and a leg.
- Come on, I'm not that tall.
- What's eight times eight?
- See? I'm not that tall.
- You only say that 'cos you don't
- ... know what being four feet's like.
There's not a lot of difference between you and me.
We're both small.
And life is beautiful for us, too.
Ahhh! Blessed youth!
Me too. All it takes is the slightest movement... oww, oww!
I can hardly move with this rheumatism!
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Mind your Own business!
- Poor creature.
Mind your own!
I'll mind mine!
How beautiful!
Lovely! Gorgeous!
Really well-made!
Leave me alone!
I want nothing to do with anybody!
- And noone's to be friend With me!
- Give it a rest!
Ugly tramps! Mind your own business!
Especially you!
- I'll kill any animal I want!
- Do you want to leave it out or what?
Go on! Clear off!
I don't like him much either.
What?
Shall we move it?
Among the chickens again!
He needs a thrashing...
...he'll remember to the end of his days.
What did you move me for?
I was fine just where I was.
- You're now facing the rising sun.
What more do you want? - Arturo!
Arturo! Get down!
Get down, Arturo, get down!
Arturo! Arturo!
Get down!
- Come on doWn, Arturo!
- No, no, no!
- Why? What did you do that for?
- I'm bored.
No. Come here- Life's beautiful.
Try it!
There you go. See?
Come on, get down!
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Husband and wife?
- Yes.
A shack for two at the end on the right.
- Are you on your own?
- No. A husband, a child and... a maid.
- Are you on your own?
- No, I'm with him.
A shack for two, down there at the end.
Excuse me, but I'd like a shack facing the sun.
- Yes.
- Facing the sun.
- What do you do?
- Giuseppe. I'm Giuseppe.
Families doWn there in One Times One Square.
Where that half-built shack is.
- I'm single.
- Single?
Okay, down there in that shack...
- Are you on your own?
- Alone.
- Alone?
- Alone. Housewife.
Bachelors over here, spinsters over there.
Edvige, move yourself.
What are you doing?
- Where is this shack?
- Right there, ma'am.
Giuseppe, stop.
Here it is.
This should do, shouldn't it?
- That's enough!
- Edvige! Wicked girl!
She has done no wrong- on the contrary.
She must be careful.
- We can't go on like this.
- She didn't do anything Wrong.
- I like it.
- You're fired, and that's that!
I love water, believe me.
I love it. Look.
But What...? It took an hour to fill it! Now I've got to do it again!
If you need anything from me, just call.
Thanks!
Here we are. This is the land.
I'll give you no more than 10 million for it.
My last Offer:
30 million and it's yours.
- 25, not a cent more.
- Who are all these people?
- The poor.
What are they doing here?
You can get rid of them
Whenever you want to.
You think so?!
Nothing easier. If I just stamp my feet, they'll run off.
Doesn't look that easy to get rid of them to me.
He says it's not easy to get rid of them. Good Grief!
Excuse me, sirs, would you like to warm your hands?
Come here!
Help yourself.
Here we all are together. As you can see, I'm cold, just like you.
That's because we're all the same. My nose might be smaller or larger than yours...
...but it's still a nose. That's the truth of it, my friends- A nose is a nose.
- What's that mean?
- What have noses got to deal with it?
Why should they leave their shacks?
You've got a house, perhaps two.
Do we have to know one another or each other's names to be brothers? No.
- Do I know your name? No. And yours?
- Rappi.
I know now because you just told me, but I didn't a minute ago.
Yet I like you just the same.
Because I've got five fingers...
On my hand and so has he... and him.
Bravo! Bravo!
Long live Mr. Mobbi!

There's someone there!

Toto, open up.
Do me a favour.
No- I'm no-one, I'm just Toto.
It's my mother doing all this.
What's this thing?
Oh, the baby! Goodness me!
Good evening.

Excuse me.

Oh! What a handsome lady!
What a gorgeous dress!
Really elegant!

I want to go to town.
Imbecile! Cretin!
What on earth are you doing?
Down! Get down.
You too, you idiot!
Get down, you fool!
Up!
Clap him in irons.
To prison with him!
Shall we attack, Mr. Mobbi?
No. Let's wait until dawn.
Let's wait for the light
Would you like the moon?
Even the moon.
Come on.
I don't know.
Come on.
Shoes.
- Toto, do me a favour, my rheumatism...
- I can't.
Kiss me. Me.
- I want to go to town.
- We'll take her!
Edvige, the dove.
My mother brought it back to me.
Would you like the sun?
Yes.
The dove!
What is it?!
Toto, where are you?
Toto!
Let's go. Forward. Move along!
Toto!
Forward! Come on! Come on!
Move! Move!
Left, right, left, right...

Toto, Toto, Toto!
Everyone grab a broom!
- Everyone grab a broom!
- Giuseppe, the baby!
Come on! Come on!
Upsy-daisy!
The little Madonna...
All we need's a shack
to live and sleep in.
All we need's a bit of ground
to live and die on.
All we want's a pair of shoes,
some socks and a little bread.
That's all we need
to believe in tomorrow.
That's all we need
to believe in tomorrow.
...towards a kingdom Where hello really means hello!
THE END
The legend of Orpheus
is well-known.
ln Greek mythology, Orpheus was
a troubadour from Thrace.
He charmed even the animals.
His songs diverted his attention
from his wife Eurydice.
Death took her away from him.
He descended
to the netherworld,
and used his charm
to win permission
to return with Eurydice
to the world of the living
on the condition
that he never look at her.
But he looked at her
and was torn away from her
by the Bacchantes.
Where does our story
take place...
and when?
A legend is entitled to be
beyond time and place.
lnterpret it as you wish...
Heurtebise, help Cegeste across the square.
I'M not drunk!
Yes, you are.
Orpheus!
- Greetings!
- You're sMashed.
Sit down for a Minute.
- I've driven everyone away.
- You've entered the lion's den.
I wanted to fiind out--
- What will you have to drink?
- Nothing, thanks. I had a drink.
It was rather bitter.
You're brave to speak to Me.
I'M no longer in the battle.
I gave up writing at 20.
I had nothing new to say.
They respect My silence.
No doubt they think
I have nothing new to say, and that a poet should not be too faMous.
They're not very fond of you.
Actually, they hate Me.
Who's the not very aMiable young drunkard who doesn't seeM to be averse to luxury?
That is Jacques Cegeste.
A poet.
He's 18 years old and adored by all.
His coMpanion, the princess, fiinances the review that published his fiirst poeMs.
The princess is very beautiful and very elegant.
She's not froM here, but she needs to be aMong us.
Here is her review.
Every page is blank!
It's called ''NudisM.''
It's absurd.
Less absurd than if it were full of absurd writing.
No excess is absurd.
Orpheus, your gravest fault is knowing how to get away with going too far.
The public loves Me.
The public is alone.
They're talking about us.
It seeMs they change everything and publish texts.
I have his poeMs.
Hold on to theM. In his current state he's apt to leave theM anywhere.
Jacques, give theM back!
I'll knock you out!
Will you calM down?
I hate scenes.
Of course.
Police?
The Poets' Cafe.
There's a brawl.
Good-bye.
Your cafe aMuses Me.
It thinks it's the center of the universe.
It is.
You know it, and that annoys you.
Is My case hopeless?
No. If it were, they wouldn't hate you.
What should I do?
Fight theM?
Astonish us.
Your papers.
My apologies, sir.
I didn't recognize you, though My wife's rooM is full of portraits of you.
- The gentleMan is with Me.
- My apologies once again.
You're in too well with the police.
- Me?
- I advise you to disappear.
You Might be blaMed for this unpleasantness.
That's too Much!
Let Me go!
You have no right to treat hiM like this!
- He has no papers.
- I vouch for hiM.
- You can explain it at the station.
- This is outrageous!
We're just doing our job.
Let Me go!
ScuM! Swine!
Let Me go!
- The little bastard bit Me!
- Watch out!
- Get the license nuMbers.
- We couldn't see theM.
Put the other units on alert.
Put hiM in My car and take care of this pathetic crowd.
Heurtebise, help theM.
And to think it happened here, where no one even passes through!
Don't stand there like a laMppost.
Yes, you!
Make yourself useful.
I need you as a witness.
Get in. Quick!
Give Me your handkerchief.
He looks badly wounded.
Don't Make useless reMarks.
The hospital is behind us.
You don't think I'd take this child to a hospital.
Don't touch hiM!
But... this young Man is dead.
Will you Mind your own business?
When will you stop Meddling in other people's business?
It was you who told Me to coMe with you.
Will you please be quiet?
Take the usual route.
The radio.
Silence
goes faster backwards.
Three times.
l repeat.
Your attention, please.
A single glass of water
lights up the world.
- Where are we going?
- Must I force you to be quiet?
A single glass of water
lights the world.
Twice. l repeat.
Hello there!
But... those are the Men who knocked this boy down.
You're being stupid.
Please, ask Me no More questions.
Get out and let My Men work.
Take the body out of the car and take it up there.
Are you sleepwalking?
I Must be.
Everyone is dawdling.
I don't like it when people do that.
Wait for Me here, young man.
Lay hiM on the floor.
Follow Me.
You're clearly asleep.
Yes, I'M asleep.
It's very strange.
- You Must explain--
- No, I won't.
Sleeping or dreaMing, the dreaMer
Must accept his dreaMs.
I have a right to ask for an explanation.
You have every right, My dear Man, and so do I... so we're even.
Turn off that Music!
There's a dead Man in the next rooM and the Men who killed hiM.
- I repeat... I deMand-
- And I deMand you not touch that radio!
- Message.: The mirrors would do well...
- CalM down and have a seat.
to reflect further.
Three times.
You're unbearable.
Sit down.
Wait for Me in this rooM.
My servants will bring you soMe chaMpagne and cigarettes.
Make yourself at hoMe.
You try too hard to understand what's going on, My dear young Man, and that's a serious Mistake.
But they expect Me at hoMe.
Let your wife wait.
She'll be all the More pleased when you return.
- Is everything ready?
- Yes, Ma'aM.
Cegeste, get up.
Hello.
Hello.
- Do you know who I aM?
- I do.
- Say it.
- My death.
Good. FroM now on you will serve Me.
I will serve you.
- You will obey My orders.
- I will obey your orders.
Excellent.
Now, coMe with Me.
Hold on to My dress.
Do not be afraid.
Don't let go.
Where are we?
- I said where are we!
- I don't know.
I'M supposed to wait for you and take you back.
Where is the princess?
Where is the villa?
Sir, if you will kindly get in the car--
Yes, yes!
The woMan was staying at the TherMal Hotel.
Call the Manager for Me.
They want to speak to the Manager.
This is the chief inspector speaking.
I'M sorry to trouble you again.
Have you conducted
your investigation?
Hello? Hello?
I can only repeat what I've told you, Inspector.
There is no woMan here fiitting that description, nor have I seen any Rolls-Royces.
I'll drop by at 2:00.
It's unbelievable.
Not at the TherMal, not at the Fabius, and not at the Two Worlds.
He'll never coMe back.
There, there, calM down.
Men always coMe back.
They're so absurd!
But where is he?
Where can he be?
There's no point in lying to you.
He's with that woMan.
No, no! I don't believe it!
Inspector, tell her it's not true.
You know Orpheus!
- Tell her it's not true.
- It's diffiicult to say.
Yours is a perfect Marriage, but soMetiMes Men lose their heads.
- It's a Messy story.
- Will the press create a scandal?
No, I gave strict orders.
Besides, the reporters don't know anything yet.
- It's a reporter, Inspector.
- What?
What is it?
I've been sent by the Sun.
Is your husband in?
My husband can't be disturbed.
He's sleeping.
He worked all night.
I caMe by to see hiM, but I didn't want to disturb hiM.
Fine. I'll go then. Can I drop you off soMewhere, Inspector?
- Not necessary. I have My car.
- What was it you wanted?
I wanted to talk to hiM about the accident.
The young Man is not at the hospital, and his friends are concerned.
Everything's fiine.
I'll stop by your offiice.
Well done!
This is terrible!
Let's not panic.
I'll stop by the offiice and speak with theM.
CoMe now. Be strong.
Follow Me, and be as quiet as possible.
I'll open the garage.
Then it's agreed?
My wife would never understand.
I'M a reporter froM the Sun.
So you're asleep, huh?
I'll let you sleep on, Orpheus.
Pleasant dreaMs!
Get out of here!
My newspaper will take your attitude into account.
Clear out.
- You'll regret this!
- To hell with the press!
- That's soMething new.
- Yes, it's new.
Eurydice, he's back!
- What are you doing here?
- CharMing!
Orpheus, if you abandon your wife, it's only norMal that she should call on those who love her.
I was frantic with worry.
I called Aglaonice.
And the inspector?
I don't think you realize how serious the situation is.
What I realize is that I coMe hoMe and fiind the police and a woMan whoM I've forbidden to ever enter My house!
You've gone too far with your bad Manners.
You'll live to regret those words!
CoMing, Inspector?
You seeM as unwelcoMe as I aM.
Go on. I'M not detaining you.
You're to coMe to My offiice toMorrow.
Aglaonice is dangerous!
Her League of WoMen is powerful.
You're crazy!
Perhaps I aM going Mad.
- Where were you!
- Oh, that!
No cross-exaMinations, please!
But you've never stayed out all night.
It's only natural that I ask you--
Nothing!
Ask Me nothing!
Orpheus, you never drink!
I do now! Do you Mind?
And here I was waiting for you to coMe hoMe to tell you soMe great news!
I don't want to hear any More stories!
I especially don't want to hear any news!
The news I get is always bad news, and I'M tired of it!
Leave Me alone.
I want to sleep!
- Who are you?
- I brought your husband back.
Where was he?
I'M the chauffeur for the woMan whose car he got in yesterday.
Did he spend the night with her?
No, Ma'aM.
My eMployer was transporting a badly wounded Man.
Your husband was at the scene and got in the car.
But My boss doesn't like people Meddling in her affairs.
And so?
She left us on the road.
She had a sMall car waiting for her near her villa.
She drove off on her own with the wounded Man.
And My husband?
I had a probleM with a loose connection.
It was better to wait till day.
Your husband slept in the car.
He was very worried about you.
I'd like to believe it.
I Might lie to you if I were a real chauffeur, but I'M not.
- What are you?
- A student-- without a penny.
I only got the job two weeks ago.
My naMe is Heurtebise.
You Make Me feel better.
- Do you know My husband?
- Who doesn't?
My husband adores Me... and now we've had a fiight.
He's not hiMself.
He's been drinking.
You dropped your work.
I was going to tell hiM the big news.
He wouldn't listen.
He saw nothing and heard nothing.
He stepped right on it without even noticing.
He's tired.
It's hard to sleep in a car.
Perhaps it's that.
He said he wanted to sleep.
But you Must be exhausted.
I'll Make soMe coffee for you.
Where are you supposed to Meet your eMployer?
Forgive Me-- your ''lady.''
Sit down.
I have no orders.
I'll wait for her in town.
Stay here if you like.
There's a little rooM above the garage.
It's not Much,
I'M warning you, but you can park your car next to ours and wait.
Tell the truth.
You want Me under your thuMb because I'M part of the story.
Nevertheless, you are charMing.
You're wrong.
I'M very ordinary.
You Must realize that woMen like Me have Much to fear froM certain people.
Your husband wouldn't lose his head easily.
He's very handsoMe and very faMous.
It's a Miracle that he's still faithful to Me.
- Please, forgive Me.
- The gas!
- What about it?
- It's still on. Be careful.
I dislike that sMell... and for good reason.
I coMMitted suicide by gassing Myself.
Since My death, the sMell has pursued Me.
Your death?
I Mean... since I alMost coMMitted suicide.
You don't look like a ghost.
I was in love with a girl.
She was quite Mean.
It's a pity she wasn't like you.
- Your naMe is Eurydice, right?
- At your service.
But I've forgotten yours.
Heurtebise, at your service.
The bird sings with its fingers.
Once.
l repeat.
And that first night
Orpheus'death
entered his room
and watched him sleep.
Two days later...
There are other radios besides this one.
I can't get this station anywhere else.
I see I'll have to live in the car.
- Nobody's forcing you!
- Darling--
38...
39...
40.
Twice.
l repeat.
SeeMs like nothing but Meaningless words to Me.
But there was a terrifiic Message yesterday.
Rest awhile.
So the Messages can start again as soon as I turn My back? Thanks.
You can't spend your life in a talking car.
- It Makes no sense.
- No sense?
My life had begun to pass its peak.
It was rotting, stinking of success and of death.
The least of these phrases is Much More than any of My poeMs.
I'd give all that I've written for even one of those little phrases.
I'M on the trail of the unknown.
Orpheus, little phrases won't feed our child.
There's a woMan for you,
Heurtebise.
You discover a world and she speaks to you of baby clothes and bills.
I adMire Orpheus.
I could have listened a thousand tiMes and not paid the slightest attention.
Where could they be coMing froM,
Heurtebise?
They're on no other station.
I'M certain they're Meant for Me.
Orpheus, nothing Matters but this car.
I could die and you wouldn't even notice.
We were dead and we didn't notice.
Beware of the Sirens!
It is l who charM them.
Your voice is very beautiful.
Be satisfiied with your voice.
Attention.
2,294. Twice.
What fascinating poetry!
Who can say what's poetry and what isn't?
Besides, if you're not happy, you don't have to stay.
I just want to be left in peace, that's all.
Take her away.
She'll drive Me Mad.
That car will drive you Mad.
Take her away, Heurtebise, or I'll do soMething I'll regret!
Orpheus was horrible.
No, he's a genius, and every genius has his Moods.
It's not that talking car that I fear.
It's what he's looking for.
But he'd be the saMe with that woMan.
All he's interested in is those phrases.
Heurtebise, I May be silly but I feel things.
It's the fiirst tiMe he's treated Me like a dog.
Don't exaggerate.
It's just a little faMily quarrel.
It starts with little faMily quarrels.
You're going to lie down and close your eyes.
Would you answer it for Me?
Yes, this is Orpheus' house.
No, this is not Orpheus.
Yes, Inspector.
Yes, I'll give hiM your Message.
The inspector called.
He's expecting you.
- And your wife doesn't feel well.
- It's natural in her condition.
- Go see her.
- All right. Would you get the car out?
- My car?
- No, Mine.
No one Must suspect the other car is here.
The whole town knows that car.
What's wrong?
- Don't you feel well?
- Very well.
- Would you like Me to get you a nurse?
- A nurse?
I can't leave you all alone.
I have to go into town.
I won't be alone.
Forgive My bad teMper.
I've been resting on My laurels.
I've got to wake up.
CoMe hoMe quickly.
Do you forgive Me?
I'M all nerves.
What is it?
Did I scare you?
I'M all on edge.
I couldn't drive.
Aren't you afraid they Might recognize Me if I drive?
You can drop Me off and wait soMewhere where no one will recognize you.
I'M going to the police station, and then I'll be back.
One never knows if one will return froM the police station.
Very funny.
Excuse Me. Have you seen a dark-haired woMan pass by?
Hello, Orpheus.
Hot under the collar?
Excuse Me--
Have you seen a young woMan pass by?
Chasing girls, Orpheus?
She's very thin and very sMart, and she walks very fast.
That's Me!
- Orpheus, your autograph, please.
- I don't have the tiMe.
- Please, sign My book!
- I don't have anything to write with.
Monique, lend Me your pen.
It's hiM, it's hiM!
Let Me go!
Idiot!
Over here! CoMe quick!
I see why he steers clear of us.
Read this.
A very annoying article.
Speak one at a tiMe or we'll never get anywhere.
You were saying, sir, that this phrase is a poeM.
No one should know better than you.
Go ahead and speak.
Orpheus sent Me the texts yesterday Morning.
I found theM quite astonishing.
I showed theM to My friends.
I noticed that one of theM-- quite an astonishing one-- reMinded Me of soMething.
I believe this is the text.
''The bird sings with its fiingers.''
I believe that's how it reads.
On the day of the accident, the guy was sMashed.
Are you speaking of the victiM?
Jacques Cegeste.
He was to give us a poeM.
After the brawl, l found these pages
at The Poets' Cafe.
He wrote the phrase you have in your hand.
Orpheus didn't know Cegeste.
He was sitting with Me when he saw
Cegeste for the fiirst tiMe.
The young Man disappears under tragic circuMstances, and his poeM coMes back to us through Orpheus, who was in the car and who claiMs he doesn't know what becaMe of Cegeste.
MadaM, you run a woMen's club, ''The Bacchantes.''
There's late-night drinking that goes on there.
-Just chaMpagne, Inspector.
- That's right.
What can you tell Me?
Orpheus Married one of My forMer serving girls.
We're very fond of her.
When she's sad, she coMes to us.
She told us she was very unhappy.
Ladies and gentleMen, I don't doubt your good faith for a MoMent, nor your wish to assist justice.
But this evidence is too fliMsy to accuse a national hero...
Orpheus!
Don't forget we call a fanfare of truMpets
''Orphean Music.''
Ladies, gentleMen--
To hell with national heroes!
We'll take care of justice ourselves!
I'M expecting Orpheus at any MoMent.
I'M sure he'll explain--
If justice refuses to intervene, then we will.
Good-bye, Inspector.
GentleMen, gentleMen!
Did you read the article?
- No, and I won't read it.
- You're right. It's horrible.
Don't Mention it to My wife.
Did you see a lot of people?
It seeMed to Me that the streets were oddly eMpty.
All I found were girls asking for autographs.
- And you?
- No. Wait-- yes! My eMployer.
She passed by in a convertible.
She slowed down and shouted to Me that the Rolls was fiine at your place, and that I should wait for her.
You should have gone after her, shouted for her to stop.
A chauffeur doesn't give orders.
He only takes theM.
Did she give you any orders?
No. She told Me to wait for orders at your place.
- What did the inspector tell you?
- I didn't go to see hiM. He can wait.
Each night, Orpheus'death
returned to his room.
- No, Eurydice, no!
- I Must go, Heurtebise.
I'll go to Aglaonice.
I Must!
She's the only one who can advise Me.
Orpheus would not like it!
He doesn't care about anything but that woMan's car.
Even if I drove you, he'd see you.
He's in the garage.
I'll take My bicycle.
I do it all the tiMe.
- In your condition it's crazy!
- I'M going!
I don't have the authority to forbid you, but what if I begged you?
I'd still go.
It wouldn't stop Me.
I'M going Mad!
Aglaonice can't tell you anything new and you'll be dead tired.
Hello.
CoMe along, Cegeste.
Get used to following Me.
- Close the door.
- What door?
The Mirror! You never understand what you're told.
The Mirror and the trapdoor.
Is everything all right?
That depends.
What do you Mean by that?
Nothing, Ma'aM.
Good.
I can't stand iMpertinence.
Is Orpheus in the garage?
Yes, Ma'aM.
Well, now, Cegeste, what does that look Mean?
Perhaps you expected to see Me with a scythe and a shroud?
My boy, if I appeared to the living the way they portray Me, they would recognize Me, and that wouldn't Make our task easy.
Heurtebise will help you.
You'd never Manage on your own.
I'll close the curtains Myself since none of you have bothered to.
Leave nothing on the table except the transMitter.
Cegeste, send the Messages.
CoMe on, get a Move on!
Not drinking doesn't suit you.
I have no tiMe to lose.
''The Mourning of young widows is as brief as a noonday candle.''
Once. I repeat.
Your phrases are an exquisite stroke of inspiration.
Thank you.
- Where are My gloves?
- They're not in the bag.
Did you forget theM?
That's the last straw!
Yes, Ma'aM. I'M sorry.
I knew it. Give Me yours,
Quickly!
You know I deMand absolute discipline like on a ship.
Do you have orders?
What did you say?
I asked you if you had orders.
When I carry out My orders,
I expect Mine to be carried out.
That's exactly why I ask if you have orders.
You dare to ask?
If you had had orders, your butchers would have coMpleted their task.
Are you in love with this idiot?
What if I aM?
You have no right to love in any world.
- Nor do you.
- What?
- You can't escape the rules.
- I order you to be quiet!
You're in love with Orpheus and you don't know how to handle it.
Shut up!
TransMit your Messages.
Make soMething up-- anything!
Could I appear and disappear like Heurtebise?
You're too cluMsy.
TransMit.
''Jupiter gives wisdoM to those he would lose.
I repeat.''
Orpheus! Orpheus!
What? Can't I ever be left alone?
Your wife is in great danger.
- Follow Me.
- Be quiet!
I'M telling you, your wife is in great danger.
- I can't hear.
- Will you listen to Me?
Let Me fiinish writing this.
Orpheus, your wife is dying!
You don't know her.
It's just a trick to get Me back in the house.
Get up.
Do you know who I aM?
- I do.
- Say it.
My death.
FroM now on you belong to the other world.
FroM now on I belong to the other world.
- You will obey My orders.
- I will obey.
Excellent.
Ah, there you are.
Orpheus Must have refused to follow you.
I will report this.
And so will I.
I have a lot to say.
Don't forget the apparatus.
You forget everything!
I suppose, Heurtebise, that you want to stay on Earth?
You look like a gravedigger in that trapdoor.
You are quite ridiculous!
I'M not the only one!
I'll Make a note of your insolence.
Cegeste!
Won't you ever learn not to look back?
People have been turned into a pillar of salt for that!
Let's go.
I warned you.
You're too late.
- Too late?
- CoMe up.
What are you doing in My rooM?
CoMe in through the window you fiind so handy for cliMbing out.
I asked you what you're doing in My rooM.
- Your wife.
- What about My wife?
Your wife is dead.
You're joking.
That would be a strange joke.
You refused to listen to Me.
Eurydice.
Orpheus, listen to Me.
It's too late for regrets.
Listen to Me.
But how... and why?
She had a bad fall and, I suspect, other things as well.
But what?
It's not possible.
Talk to Me.
Look at Me.
There's one way to undo your foolishness.
This is part of the saMe dreaM, the saMe nightMare.
But I'll wake up--
SoMebody wake Me up!
Listen to Me.
Will you listen to Me,
Orpheus?
It's all useless.
You have one chance left.
What chance?
Orpheus, you know Death.
I've spoken of her...
I've dreaMt of her...
I've sung about her.
I thought I knew her... but I didn't know her.
You know her... in person!
In person?
You have been with her.
With her?
In her rooM.
In her very rooM!
- The princess?
- That's right.
My God!
The Mirror.
I'll give you the secret of secrets.
Mirrors are the doors through which Death coMes and goes.
Look at yourself in a Mirror all your life... and you'll see death at work like bees in a hive of glass.
How do you know these frightening things?
Don't be naive.
Could I be her chauffeur without learning certain frightening things?
Heurtebise, there's nothing More to be done.
Yes, there is.
Find her again.
No Man can do that unless he kills hiMself.
A poet is More than a Man.
But My wife lies dead there on her deathbed!
It's one of her faces, as the princess is one of death's faces.
It's all false!
Your wife is in another world.
I invite you to follow Me there.
I would follow her to hell!
You needn't go that far.
I want to fiind Eurydice.
You don't need to beg.
I'M offering it to you.
Look into My eyes.
Is it Eurydice you wish to fiind, or Death?
But...
I'M asking you very clearly:
Is it Death you wish to fiind, or Eurydice?
Both.
And, if you can, betray one with the other?
Let's hurry!
I aM delighted that I aM no longer alive.
SoMeone left their gloves.
- Gloves?
- Put theM on.
CoMe on, put theM on.
With these gloves you will pass through Mirrors as if they were water.
Prove it.
Try it.
I'll go with you.
Look at the tiMe.
Hands out in front.
Perhaps you're afraid?
But this Mirror is a Mirror, and in it I see an unhappy Man.
You don't have to understand.
You just have to believe.
Where are we?
Life is a long death...
This is no-Man's land.
Here are Men's MeMories and the ruins of their beliefs.
Does every Mirror in the world lead here?
I suppose so.
But I wouldn't want to be in your gloves.
Don't think I know Much More than you do.
CoMe on, keep Moving.
It's hard to follow you.
You Move, but you're Motionless.
It's different for Me.
Glazier!
Why are these people prowling around? Are they alive?
They think so.
There's nothing More habit-forMing than habit.
Are we going far?
The words you use have no Meaning here.
There's no wind.
Why do you seeM to be heading into the wind?
''Why?''
Always ''Why?''
Ask no More questions.
Keep Moving.
Do I have to take you by the hand?
Did you receive orders to transMit your Messages?
Yes.
Did you receive orders to transMit
certain Messages?
Didn't you have to subMit the texts fiirst?
Be careful how you answer.
No. I invented the phrases and nuMbers.
I Myself sent soMe phrases
I had written earlier.
Did you notice anything peculiar about Heurtebise's behavior?
I adMired how he could coMe and go at will.
I wished I could do that, but Death told Me
I'd never be able to.
- That I was too cluMsy.
- Go on.
Take the young Man away.
Bring the other person in.
May I sit down?
Be seated.
May I sMoke?
If you wish.
Having been given orders-- or at least perMission-- to take a young Man into your service... you are accused of having taken his wife as well.
FurtherMore, of having undertaken a private enterprise, and of having used initiative.
What do you have to say in response?
Nothing.
It was a series of circuMstances.
There are no circuMstances allowed here.
There are only orders.
Did you have orders?
The laws of the other world are so different froM ours.
Perhaps I overstepped My authority without realizing it.
Before continuing the enquiry, we Must wait for another suspect and a witness.
They're here.
Hello.
We're caught like rats.
Make no Mistake, gentleMen.
These are my judges.
Stay calM.
CoMe forward.
So, Heurtebise... now is the tiMe to say what you have to say.
I have nothing to say.
You are accused of taking part in an intrigue in which Death was involved without perMission.
Do you have a good excuse?
I was her aide.
I followed her.
You lingered in the huMan world for personal reasons, which you had no right to do.
Perhaps.
There is no ''perhaps'' here.
Answer.
I didn't Mean to disobey.
CoMe forward.
You. You!
- Me?
- Yes, you.
Your naMe.
- Your profession?
- Poet.
The card says ''writer.''
- It's alMost the saMe thing.
- There is no ''alMost'' here.
What do you Mean by ''poet''?
To write, without being a writer.
Do you know this Man?
Yes.
Do you adMit you took his wife?
Yes.
To get her out of the way and have this Man for yourself?
- GentleMen--
- Silence.
CalM down.
- Keep calM.
- Do you love this Man?
Yes.
Is it true you entered his rooM to watch hiM sleep?
Yes.
Sign this paper.
Do you have a pen?
I forgot you're not a writer.
Show these two people out.
Not you.
You stay.
CoMe forward.
Do you recognize this Man?
Of course. It's Heurtebise.
Did he atteMpt to speak to you in your husband's absence?
Did he say anything shaMeful to you?
ShaMeful?
Of course not.
It's Heurtebise.
Heurtebise, do you love this woMan?
I repeat:
Do you love this woMan?
- Yes.
- That is all we wanted to know.
Sign here.
And you told theM yes?
One cannot lie here.
My love.
I loved you even before we Met.
I Must have seeMed very stupid to you.
What can we say to each other?
I don't have the right to love anyone... and yet I love.
You are all-powerful.
In your eyes.
Here death takes on innuMerable forMs.
Young and old, they receive orders.
And if you disobeyed those orders?
They can't kill you.
It is you who kill.
- What they do is worse.
- Where do the orders coMe froM?
They are sent back and forth by so Many sentinels like the toM-toMs of your African tribes... the echoes of your Mountains... the wind whispering through your trees.
I will go to he who gives those orders.
My poor love, he exists nowhere.
SoMe say he thinks of us... others, that we are his thoughts.
Others say he sleeps and that we are his dreaM... his bad dreaM.
I'll take you away froM here when they set us free.
Set us free?
I never want to leave you.
I Must leave you but I swear I will fiind a way to bring us back together.
Say ''forever.''
- Forever.
- Swear it.
I swear.
But now--
- Now their police are here.
- A Miracle will happen.
Miracles only happen in your world.
All worlds are Moved by lovers.
In our world no one is Moved.
One goes froM judge to judge.
CoMe.
Go on. I love you.
Do not be afraid.
I don't want to lose you again.
If you resist, you will lose us.
Follow Me.
GentleMen.
I shall now pronounce the verdict.
''We, this tribunal, release Orpheus' death and her aides on bail.
Orpheus is free on condition that he never speak of what he has seen.
Eurydice is free to return to life in the other world on condition that Orpheus never look upon her.
A single glance at her and he will lose her forever.''
- But--
- Silence!
Here is your wife.
Be careful!
Don't look at her!
You've Made a good start.
May I be perMitted to accoMpany
Orpheus to his house?
I'M afraid his coMpliance
May be diffiicult to Monitor without supervision by one of our people.
You May accoMpany the couple.
Under our watchful eye, of course.
- Do you have the gloves?
- No.
- Oh, yes. In My pocket.
- Put theM on.
Close your eyes.
I will guide you.
It will be easier that way in the beginning.
And... her?
May I look at her?
Under no circuMstances.
You Must not open your eyes under any circuMstances!
Take hold of hiM by the shoulders.
It will be safer that way.
CoMe.
Where are the judges?
The swine!
Cegeste...
If I were of our forMer world,
I'd say let's have a drink.
How could it be 6:00?
We entered the Mirror at 6:00.
You Must not speak of these things.
You gave your word.
There's a letter.
I'll go.
Call out froM the garden,
''I'M coMing back in...'' and Eurydice will hide.
- How convenient.
- What a nightMare!
Be careful!
Why shouldn't I look at Myself?
If Orpheus coMes in, he Might see you in the Mirror.
It's a good thing you caMe.
You're not angry with Me for what I said at the tribunal?
What did you say?
Excuse Me.
When Orpheus coMes in, hide under the table.
An anonyMous letter, written backwards.
Look out, Eurydice!
He's coMing!
Be careful, Orpheus.
- Eurydice, are you under the table?
- I aM.
Where is he?
- Where are you?
- Over there, under the table.
That's great.
''You Are A Thief And A Murderer.
We Will Meet On Your Grave.''
Beware of Mirrors.
- No need to tell Me.
- I Meant her reflection.
Heurtebise forbids Me to look at Myself in the Mirror.
Get rid of that stupid letter!
May I coMe out?
Just a Minute.
Turn your back.
You can coMe out.
I can't even say how diffiicult this is... the tension such an absurd thing causes!
It'll becoMe a habit.
A strange habit!
It's better than being blind... or losing a leg.
We don't have Much choice.
It even has its advantages.
Orpheus won't see
My wrinkles.
Fine!
It seeMs you think it's all a joke.
I don't see what else your wife could do.
- What else she could--
- Careful!
You're dangerous, My friend.
I'M not going to live with blinders on!
I'll get you a drink.
Close your eyes.
Heurtebise will sit you down while I'M in the kitchen.
I'll tell you what else
My wife could do:
She could realize the awful position I'M in.
You think she doesn't suffer too?
You're wrong.
WoMen adore coMplications.
Close your eyes.
- What if I put on a blindfold?
- That would be cheating.
It's wiser to get used to it right froM the start.
It won't be easy, I know, but we'll Make it.
Bring a chair.
Sit down.
I'll turn My back.
It's when you're Moving around that you're dangerous.
A picture of your wife is not your wife.
I'M so tired.
A decision has to be Made about how to handle this situation, and it's up to Me to Make it.
We can't spend our lives playing hide-and-seek.
Do you want Me to go live soMewhere else?
- Always exaggerating!
- CoMe on, Orpheus.
We can't share the saMe rooM.
I'll sleep here on the sofa.
Now who's exaggerating?
Be careful!
It's her fault! She could provoke even a corpse to turn around!
- I should have stayed dead.
- Tell her to be quiet!
I'M incredibly on edge.
I could do anything!
You've Made your wife cry.
Since I annoy everyone,
I'll leave!
- Where are you going?
- To my rooM.
Try to calM down.
He hates Me.
If he hated you, he would not have snared you froM death.
For that he will always be reMeMbered.
He didn't coMe for Me.
You know that.
Just like you know where he's going when he goes to the car.
Orpheus was lost to Eurydice.
She could not bear
to live this way.
She wanted to save him
from herself...
and there was only one way
to do it.
Do you love this Man?
I'M asking you if you love this Man.
What is it?
Is that you?
It's Me, Eurydice.
I know you often fall asleep with the laMp on, but since the electricity has been cut off for an hour,
I caMe down to fiind a book.
A book?
To read in the dark?
Try to understand.
Think of the risk you're exposing us to with your foolishness.
Go upstairs and close the trapdoor.
You gave Me a bad scare.
- Do you forgive Me?
- Of course.
Go upstairs and get soMe sleep.
A short black-out
had made her miss her chance.
She had to go on living,
and the next day--
You've coMe just in tiMe.
Do you understand the code?
Stock Market quotations.
- What about this?
- Be careful, your wife is coMing.
Don't push her too far.
- May I coMe in?
- Close your eyes for a Minute.
Yes, coMe in.
Your husband was listening to the stock Market.
- Get in the back.
- AM I bothering you?
I was listening out here so I wouldn't disturb you in the house.
- That noise frightens Me.
- Don't take risks.
What risks?
Orpheus can't see Me, but I can touch his cheek.
It's wonderful!
The Mirror!
That was bound to happen.
It had to happen.
It had to happen, Heurtebise.
I had enough of half-Measures and arrangeMents.
There's no getting adjusted to that.
You have to go all the way.
Stones. You can Make a statue of Me with theM!
You Mustn't stay outdoors.
There they are, the swine!
I've been expecting theM.
The letter, Heurtebise.
The anonyMous letter.
I'll talk to theM.
What does Marble think when it's being sculpted?
It thinks, ''I aM struck, insulted, ruined, lost.''
Life is sculpting Me.
Let it fiinish its work.
- The swine!
- Threaten theM with this.
This is your house!
Give Me that revolver.
I'M ordering you to give it to Me.
And I order you to get off My property.
I forbid you to coMe back on My property.
- I'll enter your property when I like.
- Do you want to kill Me?
We want to know where Jacques Cegeste is.
- Is he here with you?
- Stay back or I'll shoot.
I'll shoot!
- Step away froM the door.
- Keep calM.
He's only wounded.
No one will harM you.
Is it done?
It is done.
- Cegeste.
- MadaM?
This is the fiirst tiMe I have alMost understood the notion of tiMe.
Waiting Must be frightful for Men.
I no longer reMeMber.
- Are you bored?
- What's that?
Forgive Me.
I was talking to Myself.
lt's not the same journey
this time.
Heurtebise leads Orpheus
where he should not lead him.
No longer the wonderful
motionless journey,
Orpheus and his guide
trudge on,
at every turn forced back
and forced on
by a great
and inexplicable breath.
They are here.
I found a way to coMe to you again.
I called out froM within Me for so long that you fiinally caMe.
I heard you and waited for you.
I did not want you to stay among men.
- Where shall we hide?
- We no longer have to hide.
- We are free.
- Forever?
Forever.
Hold Me, Orpheus.
Hold Me tight.
You burn like ice.
You still have a huMan warMth.
- It's nice.
- I love you.
I love you.
- Will you obey Me?
- I will obey you.
- Whatever I ask?
- Whatever you ask.
Even if I passed sentence on you?
If I tortured you?
I belong to you and I will never leave you.
Never again.
- You know what I expect of you.
- But MadaM--
It's our last hope, and we don't have a second to lose.
- Reconsider--
- There is no need to reconsider.
There is nothing worse in any world.
Are you a coward?
The death of a poet
requires a sacrifice
to render him immortal.
For the last tiMe,
I beg you... do not try to understand what I aM going to do, for in truth it would be diffiicult to understand even in our world.
- Stand here.
- Quick.
Cegeste, to work!
Orpheus, don't Move.
Stay still. You proMised.
Work, work!
Heurtebise, I'll help you.
I'll work along with you.
Don't weaken.
Count... calculate.
Labor as I labor.
Seal hiM off. You Must!
Without willpower we are cripples.
I can do no More.
You Must will it, Heurtebise.
You Must!
- I can't.
- You're not trying.
Don't speak.
Go deep inside yourself and escape froM yourself. Run!
Overturn all obstacles!
You're nearly there.
You're there.
I see it.
I'M alMost there.
A fiinal effort, Heurtebise.
Do it.
Are you there?
Answer Me.
Are you there?
I'M there.
Then set out.
Go back in tiMe.
What has been
Must no longer be.
- I'M very tired.
- I don't care!
Work.
Work, I coMMand you!
Where are you?
In the rooM.
The gloves.
Get the gloves, quick!
Were you watching Me sleep?
Yes, My love.
- I had a terrible nightMare.
- You don't feel ill?
- No. A little headache.
- I will cure you.
- Were you working?
- I was working.
You work too hard.
Try to rest.
My books don't write theMselves.
- But they do!
- I help theM.
How is the young boy behaving?
- It Might be a girl.
- It's a boy!
He's kicking Me.
- He'll be as unbearable as his father.
- Unbearable? You?
Many people fiind Me unbearable.
Poor you! They love you.
- They loathe Me.
- That's a forM of love.
There's only one love that counts: ours.
Is it done?
It is done.
MadaM, your own aides.
They're here to arrest you.
Yes, Cegeste.
Flee!
Where?
When they arrest you here... what happens?
It's not pleasant.
It's never pleasant.
Here less than anywhere else.
Thank you.
It was nothing.
We had to return theM to their swaMp.
Farewell, Cegeste.
THE END
Harufa!
Aye, captain.
Sound for a depth.
A sounding?
Here?
Aye.
Aye, captain.
Does he expect to land here, past the very end of land?
Perhaps hunger has crazed his mind.
His belly is as empty as ours.
If there was land...
...it would be land no man would dare set foot upon.
Sinbad would.
He dares anything.
Captain!
Full fathom seven!
Sharp lookout there!
Aye, captain!
What can it be?
Perhaps a sunken reef.
Or a sea serpent.
Or something worse.
Full fathom five!
Let it be land.
Land ho!
Off the port bow!
He has the eyes of an owl.
I see nothing.
Look! There!
Land it is!
All hands, look alive!
Drop anchor. We'll go ashore at the first light of dawn.
May Allah grant we find food and water.
And may Allah grant we find nothing more.
This is no time to come to a lady's bedroom.
I bring good news to your mistress.
I know your sailor's tricks.
Now, off with you.
Go steer your course elsewhere.
Sadi...
...you must be more polite to the captain.
He's not responsible for the winds...
...which blew us off our course.
Or are you?
I blame him for taking you from the safety of your father's palace...
...to this.
I came willingly, Sadi.
What good news, captain?
We're anchoring off an island.
Tomorrow we take on food and water to continue our voyage.
The food comes none too soon.
That pirate Harufa has already found eyes for my pet.
In a week, you'll be feasting in Bagdad.
At our wedding.
I think you invented the island for just this purpose.
For another such kiss...
...I'd invent a whole continent.
Bananas! Melon!
Here, have a coconut.
And grapes!
Captain Sinbad is filling his cask with fresh water.
Stay until he returns.
A cloven hoof.
Here! There's another.
What a stride.
Captain Sinbad...
...look!
Captain!
What is it?
It has the mark of an ancient civilization.
It has the mark of Satan himself.
Come, let us go back to the ship.
Hold this.
I'm going to see where that stone mouth leads.
Help me! Help me!
Help me!
To the boat, quickly!
From the land beyond beyond...
...from the world past hope and fear...
...I bid you, genie, now appear.
I obey the master of the lamp.
I command you to build me a barrier...
...between those men and the Cyclops.
I shall try, O master.
I shall try.
What weird power restrains that monster?
The man who holds this treasure is safe from even greater danger.
Why didn't you destroy the monster?
The genie of the lamp cannot be used to work harm.
But in protection his powers are invincible.
Look out!
Help!
Help!
Oh, my prayer is answered.
You are safe.
Hoist all sails!
Full starboard rudder!
Head to sea!
The lamp!
The lamp!
My lamp!
For your ship, a king's ransom in jewels.
You forget one thing, my friend.
The Cyclopes will be on guard now.
Besides their strength, they have the lamp as well.
The Cyclopes have no speech.
It is useless to them.
I alone can invoke the power of the genie.
Who are you?
I am Sokurah.
The magician.
Is your lamp so precious that you'd risk your life to go back there?
There is nothing I would not do to regain it.
Your ambition nearly cost us our lives already.
If you're a magician...
...why do you not use your power to slay the one-eyed monster?
I had prepared a potion for just such a purpose...
...but I could not persuade the Cyclops to swallow it.
The winds that drove your ship to the island of Colossa...
...have wrecked many vessels on its shores.
The treasure of 100 years has been gathered by the Cyclopes.
The wealth that awaits us there...
...is worth many, many thousand times what you see here.
We're on a mission for the caliph of Bagdad.
It means the difference between war and peace.
I'll not risk turning back.
That is my final word.
Perhaps when you are safely in Bagdad...
...you'll be persuaded to feel differently about the venture.
I doubt it.
Harufa, show the magician to his quarters.
With fair winds, we should reach port in five days.
Magician! Your jewels.
My lord Sinbad is a very great prince in his country.
The people rejoice for the news I bring.
Peace between your father's kingdom and ours.
And do you love me just to save Bagdad from destruction?
I love you because
I cannot do otherwise.
Your eyes are mightier than all your father's armies.
Three times welcome, Sinbad.
You have done wonders to avert a war.
And what fair prize is this?
Princess Parisa, daughter of the sultan of Chandra.
Pledged to be my bride...
...a symbol of lasting friendship between our kingdoms.
Welcome as a daughter, my child.
For I love Sinbad as my own son.
I thank you, kind sir.
My father sends his wish for your health...
...and bids me tell you he'll arrive within a week for our wedding.
A royal wedding it shall be, with all honours.
Tell me about your journey.
Oh, a strange voyage and a strange tale it is, my caliph.
I did not think any place could be more beautiful than Chandra...
...yet Bagdad is.
The city is made lovely by your presence.
Without you, it is plain.
Now that we are here, all the strange terrors of the voyage seem unreal.
Yet they were all too real at the time.
Perhaps it is all a dream, and the one-eyed giant a nightmare.
And is Sokurah, the magician, also a dream?
He is very real indeed.
Something about him frightens me.
If only he would vanish when I awaken.
He's determined to gain possession of the magic lamp.
His life is distorted with a single driving wish.
I pity him...
...for I have my one wish.
Illustrious and magnificent caliph of Bagdad...
...I am honoured to be summoned by you.
Sinbad says you are a man of unusual powers.
It's my wish you show your skill at a welcome feast for the sultan.
Your wish shall be granted before it is asked.
I promise a performance that will live in your memory for all the days...
...may you live 1000 years.
You please me already.
Your palace is a jewel of comfort and hospitality, but...
- But?
- My happiness would be complete...
...if you would but grant me a single wish.
- State it.
- A fast ship...
...and a well-armed crew to return to my island.
Ships are costly, and lives are not to be wasted.
I have here the design of a new weapon.
A giant crossbow...
...to protect the men from harm.
I cannot judge, for I haven't seen the one-eyed giant.
Sinbad, what is your opinion?
Tales of our voyage have crossed Bagdad.
Only a madman would sail back to Colossa.
Sinbad's word...
...is my word.
Until the sultan's feast then?
Are you sure you can be happy here in Bagdad?
Very. I love Sinbad more with every sunrise.
I had such doubts after I let you go.
If anything had happened to you, they would have paid with many lives.
Father, you're getting angry.
You mustn't, you know.
Here comes the caliph now.
Smile at him. He's a very nice man.
May your illustrious presence...
...return to your own house a thousand folds.
If my daughter is happy,
I have honour enough.
Daughter.
Remember, not only will you triumph over good and evil...
...but you will be the most exotic woman in all of Bagdad.
- What must I do?
- Leave everything to me.
I've arranged a presentation which I think will arouse your interest.
Summon Sokurah, the magician.
Is that not Sadi, your waiting-woman?
Yes, Papa.
She has offered herself as the magician's subject.
If he can turn her into a contented woman, he is indeed a great magician.
It's a serpent.
She'll be killed!
Allah have mercy on them both.
Oh, Papa!
Behold!
It is impossible!
I am asleep.
If so, I share your dream.
Sadi!
- Are you all right?
- I assure you she is unharmed.
Well done, Sokurah.
If I have pleased you,
I hope you will grant my request...
...for an expedition to my island of Colossa.
You are truly a man of great skill...
...but I do not change my mind so easily.
Perhaps a further demonstration of my powers is necessary.
The art of prophecy has always fascinated me.
Can you foretell the future?
I can, upon occasion, foretell certain events.
It would please us to have you tell the future of our two countries.
As you wish.
I shall require a brazier of live coals.
You shall have it.
Guards!
May the unseen forces grant that I see nothing but good.
My spirit races ahead of time itself.
Ask your questions.
What do you see here in Bagdad?
I see...
...but I cannot speak.
You must!
I see...
...great disaster.
I see...
I cannot tell!
Go on. I command you!
There are great buildings falling.
Women and children slain.
I see war!
War between Bagdad and Chandra!
You lie!
What of my daughter's wedding?
There will be no wedding.
Mysterious and evil forces are at work...
...and the wedding rejoicing shall be turned to mourning!
You have done well, Sinbad.
I could not let him frighten the princess.
I spoke at your insistence.
The events my spirit saw lurk as dire possibilities.
If you request...
...I will use my powers to disperse the evil forces...
...and avert such disaster.
Then I presume I must grant you the ship and sailors you desire.
Such a gift of gratitude would seem fitting.
So your lies are cheap schemes...
...to force me to grant your wish.
Get out! You have committed treason against both Bagdad and Chandra.
If you're found within the walls of our city by sunset tomorrow...
...your eyes will be torn out...
...that you may see no more evil dreams.
To the wedding, and our lasting friendship.
Good night.
Though I wish the night were gone.
Tomorrow will come soon.
And all the nights thereafter cannot come soon enough.
I cannot imagine waking to see your face, instead of Sadi's.
She was indeed transformed tonight by that magician.
- Suppose that his prophecy...
- I'll dream of dangers he predicted...
...so you can rescue me.
The wedding procession will pass here...
...then pause at the throne, where you and I will be seated equally.
My lord! My lord!
Where is she?
Where is my daughter?
The princess!
Sinbad, here I am!
Sinbad, look!
Here on the pillow.
Look closely!
No, it cannot be!
It is.
- The world's grown very large overnight.
- It's true.
It is you, my darling.
My daughter, where is she?
Where is my...
Ten thousand devils!
What evil sorcery is this?
My daughter, is it you?
Speak! Tell me my eyes lie.
You see truly, my father.
I would have borne any insult.
But my dear one...
...my daughter!
Look upon your city.
Enjoy the sight...
...for soon it will be rubble and bleached bones.
Sokurah!
Sokurah, wait.
- The princess...
- I know.
In my vision, I saw her state.
But I feared to tell you because of your anger.
Tell me, can you help her?
Possibly.
No!
No! The risk would be too great.
If she can be helped,
I will do anything.
I cannot turn back.
If I am in Bagdad at sundown, my eyes will be dark forever.
I'll answer to the caliph for that.
No, l...
Tell us what must be done.
There is one potion which will remove the evil charm.
- Mix the potion, quickly.
- We lack the most vital ingredient.
A piece of shell from the egg of a giant bird called the roc.
Monstrous bird that nests on the peaks of Colossa.
Without this shell, the potion is useless.
We have no choice. I must sail at once and bring back the eggshell.
No. The princess must go with us.
Only in my castle can the potion be used.
I'll order a ship at once.
We'll need your design for the giant crossbow.
The palace jeweler can make a tiny home for Parisa.
Where will you find a crew, Sinbad?
The bravest of my former men will come.
That won't be enough.
Where will you find the others?
I'll find them...
...where men fear the headman's ax over the Cyclops. In the prison yard.
Hear me!
Hear!
Come here!
I am Captain Sinbad. I am here with an offer of freedom.
I have come to raise a crew for the hard and dangerous voyage to Colossa.
The land of the Cyclopes!
We may be thieves and murderers...
...but we're not fools.
The caliph has offered you full pardon.
He offers a choice of two kinds of death.
I fought the Cyclops and here I stand, alive.
This man was there.
He sails with me again.
What will it be?
We need five and 20 men.
Freedom...
...or the hangman's noose?
They'll not kill Golar!
He'll spit in the Cyclops' eye first!
- That's right.
- I'll sign up.
- Let's go!
- Me too.
Take me!
The ship's hold is filled with the giant crossbow.
- Then lash the arrow to the mast.
- Aye, aye, captain.
Careful! We'll need that arrow to fight for our lives!
We're all fools.
If we're to fight for our lives, let us fight against men, not monsters.
There are rich prizes plying in the coastal waters.
This vessel could be ours for the taking.
What of those men who are loyal to the captain?
We'll feed them to the fish.
Heave!
Heave! Heave!
I fear this will be a tedious voyage for you.
I shall never complain, not as long as I'm near you.
A hazardous voyage too, in spite of all the plans we made.
If you were as small as I, you could walk among the giants unseen.
They're not our only danger.
We must sail uncharted waters with a doubtful crew.
I wonder what they would think, if they could see me as I am.
I do not trust them out of my sight, or in it.
Yes?
Captain, can I have a few words with you?
For the past week, there's been unrest among the crew.
I've heard dangerous mutterings.
All weapons are locked up.
Without weapons, they can do nothing.
In a few more days, we should reach the island.
Something troubles your appetite, Sinbad.
I shall be glad when we arrive.
Sinbad...
...how can you love a tiny...
...insignificant female, such as I?
A diamond is a tiny thing...
...yet very precious and beautiful.
Quickly, princess!
Stop! Do not kill him!
We surrender!
Harufa, we must give up.
This is a touching show of friendship.
Take his sword.
Here! The magician's cloak...
...will make a flag for us.
Here are the men who would feed us to the one-eyed monster.
What shall we do with them?
Kill them! Drown them!
You hear the verdict.
You die at dawn.
And my wish for a night of pleasant dreams.
Hear my curse, for it seals your doom.
Those who harm us shall be driven mad!
Terror shall be in your hearts.
Before dawn, you will plead with us for your very lives.
Oh, save me.
Oh, save us, magician.
Save us!
For you, I will tie the knot myself.
So you will strangle slowly.
Throw him in the forward hold!
Helmsman!
Take a course due south.
We'll circle back to the trade routes. Go on!
We could have sliced them to bits...
...but you stopped us to save this idiot...
...who babbles nonsense.
You will see.
Winds and currents will drive the ship southward...
...and my prophecy will come true.
How can you be certain?
South of Colossa lies an accursed island...
...inhabited by wailing demons.
Their screaming is heard over a hundred leagues.
Men hearing it are driven mad.
They drive their ships onto the jagged rocks and are devoured by sea serpents.
What's to prevent us from sharing their fate?
If we stuff cloth in our ears.
Well, that's fine.
Now we won't be driven mad.
We'll just be devoured by sea monsters.
If we wax the cloth, it will stop most of the sound.
The wind screams like 10,000 fiends!
Full port rudder!
Change your course!
We'll be wrecked on the rocks!
Ho, lookout!
What can you see?
Hold this course...
...or you'll die!
Steer south!
High winds and seas surround the demon island.
The sound penetrates even here.
Give me that glass!
Full port bow!
I'm going to release them.
Full port rudder!
Save us!
Save us, captain...
...before we're wrecked.
There's a narrow channel through the rocks. It is our only chance.
Has the whole ship gone mad?
Full port rudder!
Full port rudder!
Sharp lookout for the peaks of Colossa!
The crossbow will be ready within the hour.
Keep the men at the crossbow.
I'd rather go with you.
I know, but you're more valuable here.
Everything is ready.
The sooner we leave, the better. Come.
Here.
- Who's in command of the great crossbow?
- You are.
This is the valley of the Cyclopes.
In the centre of the island are the peaks where the great birds nest.
- Then our path lies through the valley?
- Your path.
We separate into two groups.
Because if one group is captured, the other may attempt to free them.
We meet at the far side of the valley...
...tonight at sunset.
May the powers of good protect all our footsteps.
We will stop and rest here and proceed again at nightfall.
You, Golar!
Do not drink so deeply.
We'll need the water for our climb.
Why so miserly?
- We can fill the skin from the pool.
- That's right.
This water is poisoned.
The man who lets it touch his lips will be dead.
Poison?
Would you care to try it?
Wait here a moment.
What are you doing here?
Don't worry.
The crossbow's in good hands.
Let us get back to the others before the Cyclops returns.
They were here a moment ago.
See if you can find them.
Captain Sinbad!
Captain Sinbad!
Come quickly!
Here, through here. Hurry!
We're rich! We're rich!
Come, master. Take your fill!
Pearls, rubies, gold, everything!
Out of here!
There'll be time enough for treasure after we finish our mission.
Out! Hear me, or by my sword,
I'll run you through.
Let me go!
Sinbad's men must be trapped.
You will remain here.
Help me!
Sinbad, help!
Help me...
Help me! Help!
Must we thirst here...
...while water runs around us, just because of the magician?
He has strange, strange powers.
We dare not disobey.
- Golar dares.
- That's right.
Then drink from the forbidden pool.
You think he's afraid?
Here. Show them.
Hey!
That's good!
Tastes like choice wine.
Help! Sinbad!
Help me, Sinbad!
Sinbad! Help me!
Lend me a hand.
Maybe I can reach the latch.
Sokurah!
Come here.
There's a latch on top of the cage.
Try to open it.
Sokurah!
Why does he leave us?
He leaves us to share the fate of Harufa.
But we shall escape.
Escape? How?
You must never reveal what you're about to see.
- Just get us out of here.
- Save us!
Princess, there's a latch on top of this cage. Will you try to open it?
I'll do my best.
I see the latch. I'll try.
Sinbad, it is stuck!
I cannot move it.
You must try, princess.
It's our only hope.
The lamp!
It is done, Sinbad.
Lift me up.
Must we hide here so quietly while our comrades are in danger?
- Are we afraid of Sokurah?
- Who's afraid?
Then follow us.
Courage, Harufa.
Put out the fire.
Let's get out of here!
The lamp!
Here!
Here I am!
Over here!
Over here!
Closer!
Closer!
A little further.
Here!
Closer!
Look! There he is!
He's dead.
The danger is far from passed.
There are still Cyclopes alive.
I alone know the words that will summon the genie.
I should have the lamp.
I do not trust you.
When I called you to free us, you didn't open the cage.
I do not understand this lamp's power.
If we need it, it shall be safely within my grasp.
As you say.
Poor Rahan.
Allah knows many ways of dealing with hungry men.
Look, Sokurah.
We have reached our goal!
- There's something moving inside.
- It is the season for the young birds.
Higher up there will be eggs already hatched.
Come this way.
No more climbing, please.
We're starving!
Here.
Let us break open the egg!
Put down that spear!
You should not have let them do that.
Hungry men don't ask, they take.
Here. The princess must be restored without delay.
That must be combined with elements found in my cave...
...at the foot of the mountain.
That's the edge of the Cyclopes' domain.
What protects your castle from them?
You will see when we get there.
- I'm glad to breathe fresh air.
- Good news, my princess.
We have the eggshell for the potion.
Your words are happy, but your face is sad. Why are you troubled, Sinbad?
I do not trust the magician.
Our only hold over him is this lamp...
...and he alone knows the secret of its power.
Sinbad...
...let me enter the lamp.
Perhaps I can learn how to call the genie.
But is such a thing possible?
Well, who knows what's possible within a magic lamp?
Please let me try.
All right.
If all is not well, call quickly.
I will. I promise I will.
Are you all right, Parisa?
Oh, fine.
There's a wonderful mist down here.
Be careful.
Welcome, Princess Parisa.
You know who I am.
A genie knows many things.
And you're as tiny as I am.
How else could I live inside a lamp?
In such a lovely one.
Had I known how beautiful it is,
I'd have visited you long ago.
You must be truly happy here.
The most comfortable prison is still a lonely place.
But aren't you sometimes called to our world to work your wonders?
But then I'm summoned as a slave...
...to do the bidding of whoever holds the lamp.
I long to be free...
...to be an adventurer and to sail the seas as Captain Sinbad does.
But those are dreams for real boys...
...and not for a genie.
Is there no way to escape?
Perhaps someday.
But I cannot return to the real world until I'm called by my name.
What is your name?
Baronni.
I have a promise of freedom inscribed in the lamp.
Would you care to see?
I should love to see it.
It is here.
"When the big that is small...
...shall again become tall.
Into fiery rock, to rise...
...you must fall."
"When the big that is small" ...
I was big and now I'm small.
You know what it means?
I'm not sure.
But I'll make you a bargain.
If you'll help me, I'll help you.
What do you want me to do?
Tell me the magic words that call you forth from the lamp.
I like you, and I wish to help.
But I don't know.
It's a great power to grant.
In return, I promise
I'll try to help you, Baronni.
Now tell me the words that invoke your protective power.
From the land beyond beyond.
"From the land beyond beyond." Go on.
From the world past hope and fear.
"From the world past hope and fear."
I bid you, genie, now appear.
"I bid you, genie, now appear."
"I bid you, genie, now appear."
The genie was very nice to you.
Yes.
He promised to help us, if we'd help him.
We will help him.
Look!
From the land beyond beyond.
From the world past hope and fear.
I bid you, genie, now...
Harufa, the lamp!
Parisa!
Parisa!
Sokurah!
Sokurah!
Parisa.
Sokurah!
From the land beyond beyond.
From the world past hope and fear.
I bid you, genie, now appear.
Mighty Sinbad, the slave of the lamp is yours to command.
Where is Princess Parisa?
She's held by the magician...
...in his underground castle at the foot of the mountain trail.
I will meet you there.
But how will l...
Go ahead, turn it.
Inside is another wheel...
...with which to loose the dragon so that he may guard the entrance.
Sokurah!
Parisa!
I knew I could trust your Sinbad to bring the lamp to us.
Now I will show you a sight which will make your heart leap.
Behold.
Sinbad!
Sinbad, I'm here!
Come this way.
He hurries to greet his princess.
I must prepare a welcome for him.
I warn you...
...tell him to do as I ask.
Are you all right, Parisa?
Oh, yes, I'm all right.
Restore the princess at once.
I will restore her in exchange for the lamp.
At once!
The potion is already prepared.
Bring the princess here.
Give me the eggshell.
If you harm her, you die.
Sinbad?
I'm here, princess.
And now...
...if you please, my lamp.
You shall have it when we are safely at the ship.
Very well.
Let us go.
Kill.
Kill him.
We're trapped.
We must summon the genie, quickly!
From the land beyond beyond.
From the world past hope and fear.
I bid you, genie, now appear!
Command me, O princess.
Help us escape from this cave.
I shall try, O princess. I shall try.
Hold tight, princess.
What is it, princess?
I remember now.
The genie's verse.
"Into fiery rock, to rise you must fall."
I made a promise to the genie.
This is the fiery rock.
The lamp must be thrown into it so he can be set free.
If we lose his help now, we may never reach the ship alive.
And if the lamp is thrown into the flaming pit, he may be destroyed.
Still, your promise must be kept.
Let's go.
Follow!
Follow!
Kill! Kill!
Follow! Kill!
Ali!
- Ali!
- Yes, captain?
Man the crossbow.
- Take the princess to the longboat.
- Yes, captain.
Hurry! Come on! Hurry!
Hurry! Come on!
Pull!
Pull!
Follow! Follow!
Pull for your lives!
Follow! Kill!
Pull for your lives!
Head for the sea!
Farewell, Colossa.
I'm only sad about one thing.
I shall miss Harufa.
And I'll never forget our friend, Baronni.
His one wish was to sail the seas with you.
You called for Baronni?
I am here.
It's the genie!
No longer the genie, captain, but your cabin boy.
Then prepare my cabin for a celebration.
I already have, captain.
I already have.
See for yourself.
Why, it's the treasure of the Cyclopes!
I put it onboard for you...
...as sort of a wedding present.
Well done. I know you'll be as good a sailor as you were a genie.
I shall try, captain.
I shall try.

THE WHITE REINDEER
A child is born to a fiery snow.
Grew a girl with hay shoes.
Like a young reindeer doe.
Didn't know at her father's home.
Didn't know at her father's home.
When she went to her bridegroom's house.
That she was born a witch.
An evil spirit in her stomach.
Sacrificed at the altar of Maddar Ahkka
Sacrificed at the altar of Maddar Ahkka
A white reindeer.
From there she ran as a mountain reindeer.
Until the moment was at hand.
A lightning impaled the white.
There lay the girl with the hay shoes.
The snowblanket as her cover and a pillow made of snow under her head.
Pirita ! Will you come with us ?
Look at that.
Go, reindeer!
Faster !
Faster !
A reindeer is fast, but a wolf is faster.
Got you.
Do you love me ?
Looks like a hunter of she-bears is coming.
We have a buyer.
You have a bird. Sell her to us.
We have a buyer.
You have a bird. Sell her to us.
- Are you serious ?
-Yes I am.
- You can't treat our daughter badly.
- I'll do my best.
- You can't treat our daughter badly.
- I'll do my best.
A great acknowledgement on behalf ofthe bride and the bridegroom.
To you who gave a present to this honorary table.
Heads together. Like frogs.
Hello to all the wedding guests.
And to the memory of the young couple.
There is no more booze.
The bread and the salt are eaten.
Go after the reindeer.
Aslak.
Aslak !
Pirita !
I'll leave this to you as a house reindeer.
It'll grow up to be a beautiful draft animal. Thank you.
Again you leave and who knows when you'll be back. I'll miss you.
Again you leave and who knows when you'll be back. I'll miss you.
The weeks'll go by fast.
Goodbye, my bird.
Come back soon !
Hello.
I knew you'd come.
What do you want ?
A love potion ?
What do you want ?
A love potion ?
That's what the young women, and the older ones too, want.
A man of the mountains.
Tsalkku-Nilla knows how to do it.
Herbs from beyond ten mountains, from the streams of ten creeks.
A little bit of death mold.
The testicles of ten deers.
The strenght of ten deers.
Tsalkku-Nilla is such a seer that he brings the lost reindeer back home too.
He brings the dead back from their graves too.
You must sacrifice to the great altar the first living thing that you encounter on your way home.
Than can no man resist you.
Yet this winter you...
Yet this winter you...
Continue.
Witch !
Witch !
You must sacrifice to the great altar the first living thing...
Living thing...
Pirita ! Catch !
I missed you.
The first living thing...
Good day.
- Where is Aslak ? I want to see him.
- Other there at the resting point.
- Where is Aslak ? I want to see him.
- Other there at the resting point.
- Aslak has a fine-looking woman.
- You bet.
Aslak left with Tauno to hunt reindeer.
Found fresh tracks from the mountain.
Stay here for the night, he may come back soon.
Then no man can resist you...
A wild reindeer.
Don't. It's white.
Let's catch it.
I can catch it.
You'll see.
You'll see.
- How'd it happen ?
- Something odd about this.
Niilo left to chase a wild white reindeer.
We found him dead at the Demon's valley.
- Where are you going ?
- Cut some lichen. Come with me.
Don't play with me.
Will I say Hi to Aslak for you ?
Let's do it.
It's certainly that white reindeer.
That's your local superstition.
A reindeer can't kill a man like that.
That's the second man found dead at the Demon's valley.
There were clearly reindeer tracks in the body and no other tracks.
Jouni est parti 3 sa poursuite.
Jouni est parti 3 sa poursuite.
It's no ordinary reindeer.
It's bewitched.
You won't make me believe that.
Witchcraft won't help if it gets in my sight.
You won't make me believe that.
Witchcraft won't help if it gets in my sight.
Bullets won't hurt it.
You need cold iron.
Bullets won't hurt it.
You need cold iron.
- You need to kill it with a spear.
- A spear you say ?
L'll rely on my rifle if that witch attacks me.
You shouldn't make fun of a witch.
It can become angry.
A lot happens here that you can't understand somewhere else.
A lot happens here that you can't understand somewhere else.
What's wrong with that dog ?
I'll show you how to kill a witch.
What is that ?
I shot it...
I shot it...
Something's happened.
Reindeer...
I shot it... Laughing...
I shot it... Laughing...
We paid 15000 for it.
Yes, I paid 15000.
It was nice.
It was nice.
After a week it dropped its horns.
Witch !
Witch !
Witch ! White reindeer !
Witch ! White reindeer !
Witch ! White reindeer !
Catch the witch !
Catch the reindeer !
I'll kill the Witch !
Let's go home.
What's wrong with you ?
What has happened to you ?
Are you ill?
Are you ill?
I'm afraid. You mustn't go after the white reindeer.
Promise me.
I don't want to lose you.
All right. I'm not going anywhere.
A shame that the little white reindeer got away.
Wonder if a wolf caught it on the mountain.
What are you looking at?
Is it wrong ifl look ?
Haven't seen you in a long time.
Go to bed now.
I'll have to go soon too.
Pirita !
I saw... a horrible dream.
- Did I scare you ?
- I'm afraid to sleep.
Look at the moon glare.
You have had a bad dream.
Sleep, my bird.
No ! Don't go !
No ! Don't go !
No ! Don't go !
No ! Don't go !
Don't go 5
It's the bewitched reindeer !
The white reindeer !
The white reindeer !
Why are you forging a spear?
You can only kill a witch with cold iron.
The white reindeer !
The white reindeer !
Tsalkku-Nilla !
Tsalkku !
The powerful spirit ofthe altar.
Take back the spell.
Release me from witchcracft.
Hear me ! Release me !
Release me ! Release me !
The second star to the right
Shines in the night for you
To tell you that the dreams you plan
Really can come true
The second star to the right
Shines with a light so rare
And if it's Never Land you need
Its light will lead you there
Twinkle, twinkle little star
So we'll know where you are
Gleaming in the skies above
Lead us to the land
We dream of
And when ourjourney is through
Each time we say
Good night
We'll thank the little star that shines
The second from
The right
All this has happened before.
And it will all happen again.
But this time it happened in London.
It happened on a quiet street in Bloomsbury.
That corner house over there is the home of the Darling family.
And Peter Pan chose this particular house... because there were people here who believed in him.
There was Mrs Darling.
George, dear, do hurry. We mustn't be late for the party, you know.
Mrs Darling believed that Peter Pan was the spirit of youth.
- But Mr Darling--
- Mary, unless I find my cuff links... we don't go to the party.
And if we don't go to the party, I can never show my face in the office again.
And if I can never-- Ouch!
Well, Mr Darling was a practical man.
The boys, however,
John and Michael... believed Peter Pan was a real person... and made him the hero of all their nursery games.
Blast you, Peter Pan!
Take that! Give up,
Captain Hook? Give up?
Never! I'll teach you to cut off me hand!
Oh, no, John.
It was the left hand.
Oh, yes.
Thank you, Wendy.
Wendy, the eldest, not only believed... she was the supreme authority on Peter Pan... and all his marvellous adventures.
Oh, Nana, must we always take that nasty tonic?
Nana, the nursemaid, being a dog... kept her opinions to herself... and viewed the whole affair with a certain tolerance.
Take that!
Insolent boy!
I'll slash you to ribbons!
And I'll cut you to pieces.
- Aha!
- Ouch!
- Careful, Michael, my glasses.
- I'm sorry,John.
You'll never leave this ship alive!
Oh, yes, I will.
Take that!
Scuttle me bones, boy,
I'll slit your gizzard.
Oh, no, you won't.
Back, back, back, you villain!
- Insolent pup!
- Wicked pirate!
- Aha, I got ya.
- You didn't either.
You never touched me.
Take that and that!
And that!
Boys, boys, less noise, please.
- Oh, hello, Father.
- You old bilge rat.
Wh-Wh-What?
Now, see here, Michael--
Oh, not you, Father.
You see, he's Peter Pan.
- And John's Captain Hook.
- Yes, yes, of course.
Uh, have you seen my cuff--
Oh, Nana, for goodness sake!
Where are those cuff links?
- Cuff links, Father?
- Yes, the gold ones.
Michael, the buried treasure.
Where is it?
- I don't know.
- The map then.
- Where's the treasure map?
- It got lost.
- Good heavens, my shirt front!
- Hurray! You found it!
- You found it!
- Yes, so I have.
And hereafter--
Don't paw me, Michael.
This is my last clean--
No! No!
George, dear, we really must hurry or we'll be late--
- Mary, look!
- George.
- It's only chalk, Father.
- Why, Michael.
It's not his fault.
It's in the story.
- And Wendy says--
- Wendy? Story?
I might have known. Wendy!
- Wendy!
- Yes, Father?
- Would you kindly ex--
- Oh, Mother!
- You look simply lovely.
- Thank you, dear.
- Wendy.
-Just my old gown made over.
- But it did turn out rather nicely, didn't--
- Mary, if you don't mind.
- I'd like--
- Why, Father, what have you done to your shirt?
What have I-- Oh!
- Now, George, really.
It comes right off.
- That's no excuse.
Wendy, haven't I warned you?
Stuffing the boys' heads with a lot of silly stories.
- Oh, but they aren't.
- I say they are.
Captain Crook!
Peter Pirate!
- Peter Pan, Father.
- Pan! Pirate! Poppycock!
- Oh, no, Father. Father, have you--
- Oh, you don't understand.
Absolute poppycock!
And let me tell you, this ridiculous--
- Now, George.
- ""Now, George.''
""Now, George''!
Well, ""Now, George,'' will have his say!
- Please, dear.
- Mary, the child's growing up.
It's high time she had a room of her own.
- Father!
- George!
- What?
- No!
- I mean it!
Young lady, this is your last night in the nursery.
And that's my last word on the matter--
No!
No!
Oh!
Poor Nana.
""Poor Nana''?
This is the last straw!
Out! Out, I say!
- No, Father, no!
- Yes!
There'll be no more dogs for nursemaids in this house!
Goodbye, Nana.
""Poor Nana.''
Oh, yes, ""Poor Nana.''
But ""Poor Father''?
Oh, no!
Blast it!
Where is that rope?
Oh, thank you.
Dash it all, Nana, don't look at me like that.
It's nothing personal.
It's just that--
Well, you're not really a nurse at all.
You're, well, a dog.
And the children aren't puppies.
They're people.
And sooner or later, Nana, people have to grow up.
But, Mother,
I don't want to grow up.
Now, dear, don't worry about it any more tonight.
He called Peter Pan
""absolute poppycock.''
I'm sure he didn't mean it,John.
Father was just upset.
Poor Nana, out there all alone.
No more tears, Michael.
It's a warm night.
She'll be all right.
- Mother.
- What is it, dear?
- Buried treasure.
- Now, children.
Don't judge your father too harshly.
After all, he really loves you very much.
Oh, don't lock it, Mother.
He might come back.
- ""He''?
- Yes, uh, Peter Pan.
You see, I found something that belongs to him.
- Oh? And what's that?
- His shadow.
- ""Shadow''?
- Mmm, Nana had it.
But I--
I took it away.
Oh? Yes, of course.
Good night, dear.
But, George, do you think the children will be safe without Nana?
Safe? Of course they'll be safe. Why not?
Well, Wendy said something about a shadow, and I--
- Shadow? Whose shadow?
- Peter Pan's.
Oh, Peter Pan--
Peter Pan!
You don't say. Goodness gracious, whatever shall we do?
- But, George-- Really, I--
- Sound the alarm!
- Call Scotland Yard!
- There must have been someone.
Oh, Mary, of all the impossible, childish fiddle-faddle.
Peter Pan indeed. How can we expect the children to grow up and be practical...
- George, dear.
- when you're as bad as they are.
- Please.
- No wonder Wendy gets these idiotic ideas.
Over there, Tink, in its den.
Is it there?
Must be here somewhere.
Tink! Shh!
Stop playing and help me find my shadow.
Shadow. Oh, shadow.
Huh?
Aha!
Peter Pan! Oh, Peter!
I knew you'd come back.
I saved your shadow for you.
Oh, I do hope it isn't rumpled.
You know, you look exactly the way I thought you would.
Oh, a little taller perhaps.
But then--
Oh, you can't stick it on with soap, Peter.
It needs sewing.
That's the proper way to do it.
Although, come to think of it,
I've never thought about it before.
Uh, sewing shadows, I mean.
Of course, I knew it was your shadow the minute I saw it.
And I said to myself, I said, ""I'll put it away for him until he comes back.
Oh, he's sure to come back.''
And you did, didn't you, Peter?
After all, one can't leave his shadow lying about and not miss it sooner or later.
Uh, don't you agree? But what
I still don't understand is how
Nana got it in the first place.
She really isn't-- Oh, sit down.
It won't take long.
She really isn't vicious, you know.
She's a wonderful nurse.
- Although Father says--
- Girls talk too much.
Yes, girls talk too--
Hmm? Oh.
- Well, get on with it, girl.
- Uh, my name is Wendy.
- Uh, Wendy Moira Angela Darl--
- Wendy's enough.
Oh, uh, but how did
Nana get your shadow, Peter?
Jumped at me the other night at the window.
Well, what were you doing there?
- I came to listen to the stories.
- My stories?
- But they're all about you.
- Of course.
That's why I like 'em.
I tell 'em to the Lost Boys.
The Lost Boys--
Oh, I remember.
- They're your men.
- Uh-huh.
I'm so glad you came back tonight.
I might never have seen you.
- Why?
- Because I have to grow up tomorrow.
- Grow up!
- Tonight's my last night in the nursery.
But that means no more stories.
- Mm-hmm.
- No!
I won't have it.
Come on!
Bu-Bu-But where are we going?
To Never Land.
- Never Land!
- You'll never grow up there.
Oh, Peter, it will be so wonderful.
But wait.
What would Mother say?
Mother? What's Mother?
Why, Peter, a mother is someone who-- who loves and cares for you.
- And-- And tells you stories--
- Good! You can be our mother.
- Come on.
- Now, just a minute, I--
Let me see now.
I-I have to pack.
Oh, and I must leave a note when I'll be back.
Of course, I couldn't stay too long.
And then I'll have to--
Oh, but Never Land.
Oh, I--
I-I'm so happy I--
I think I'll give you a-- a kiss.
What's a-- a kiss?
Oh, well, uh,
I-I'll show you.
- Oh!
- Stop! Stop it, Tink!
John,John, wake up!
He's here.
Huh? Jiminy!
Ooh, what in the world was that?
Tinker Bell.
Don't know what got into her.
Hello, Peter Pan.
I'm Michael.
And my name is John.
How do you do?
- Hello.
- Oh, look, a firefly.
- A pixie.
- Amazing!
- What's the pixie doing?
- Talking.
- What did she say?
- She says you're a big, ugly girl.
Oh. Well, I think she's lovely.
- Well, come on, Wendy, let's go.
- Where are we going?
- To Never Land.
- Never Land!
- Peter's taking us.
- ""Us''?
Well, of course. I-I couldn't go without Michael and John.
Oh, I should like very much to cross swords with some real buccaneers.
Yes, and fight pirates too.
Well, all right, but ya gotta take orders.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Me too.
But, Peter, how do we get to Never Land?
- Fly, of course.
- ""Fly''?
It's easy. All you have to do is to-- is to--
Is to--
- Ha! That's funny.
- What's the matter?
- Don't you know?
- Oh, sure.
It's-- It's just that
I never thought about it before.
Say, that's it!
You think of a wonderful thought.
- Any happy, little thought?
- Uh-huh.
- Like toys at Christmas?
- Sleigh bells, snow?
Yep! Watch me now.
Here I go!
It's easier than pie.
- He can fly!
- He can fly!
He flewed!
- Now you try.
- I'll think of a mermaid lagoon... underneath a magic moon.
I'll think I'm in a pirate's cave.
I think I'll be an Indian brave.
Now everybody try.
One, two, three!
We can fly! We can fly!
We can fly!
This won't do.
What's the matter with you?
All it takes is faith and trust.
Oh! And something
I forgot. Dust!
- Dust?
- Dust?
Yep, just a little bit of pixie dust.
Now, think of the happiest things.
- It's the same as having wings.
- Let's all try it just once more.
Look! We're rising off the floor.
-Jiminy!
- Oh, my! We can fly!
- You can fly!
- We can fly!
Come on, everybody.
Here we go!
Off to Never Land!
Think of a wonderful thought
Any merry little thought
Think of Christmas
Think of snow
Think of sleigh bells
Off you go like reindeer in the sky
You can fly, you can fly
You can fly
Think of the happiest things
It's the same as having wings
Take the path that moonbeams make
If the moon is still awake you'll see him wink his eye
You can fly, you can fly
You can fly
Up you go with a heigh and ho
To the stars beyond the blue
There's a Never Land waiting for you
Where all your happy dreams come true
Every dream that you dream will come true
Come on, Nana!
When there's a smile in your heart
There's no better time to start
Think of all thejoy you'll find
When you leave the world behind and bid your cares goodbye
You can fly, you can fly
You can fly, you can fly
You can fly
There it is, Wendy. Second star to the right and straight on till morning.
When there's a smile in your heart
There's no better time to start
Think of all thejoy you'll find when you leave the world behind
And bid your cares goodbye
You can fly, you can fly
You can fly, you can fly
You can fly
You can fly, you can fly
You can fly
Oh, a pirate's life is a wonderful life
A-rovin'over the sea
Give me a career as a buccaneer
It's the life of a pirate for me, oh
The life of a pirate for me
Oh, a pirate's life is a wonderful life
They never bury your bones
For when it's all over a jolly sea rover drops in on his friend, Davy Jones
Oh, my good friend
Davy Jones
- Good morning, shipmates.
- And what's good about it, Mr Smee?
Here we are, collecting barnacles on this miserable island.
While his nibs plays ring-around-the-rosy with Peter Pan.
Look out. It might go off.
We ought to be tending to the business of looting ships.
Why, I've almost forgotten how to slit a throat.
- Better hop it.
- And tell the captain... we wants to put to sea, see?
Peter Pan--
Blast that Peter Pan!
If I could only find his hideout,
I'd trap him in his lair.
But where is it?
Mermaid Lagoon?
No, we've searched that.
We've combed Cannibal Cove.
H-Here! No. No, no, no!
That's Indian terri--
But wait.
Those redskins know this island better than I do me own ship.
Ah...
I wonder.
- Good morning, Captain.
- I've got it!
Tiger Lily, Smee!
T-Tiger Lily, Captain?
The Chief's daughter.
She'll know where Pan is hiding.
B-B-But, but will she talk, Captain?
Oh, a little persuasion might be in order.
Now let me see.
Boiling in oil?
Keelhauling? Marooning?
A pirate's life is a wonderful l-life
You'll find adventure and sport
But live every minute for all that is in it
The life of a pirate is short
Oh, the life--
Now let me see, where was I?
Oh, dear, dear, dear Captain Hook.
Shooting a man in the middle of his cadenza?
It ain't good form, you know.
""Good form,'' Mr Smee?
Blast good form!
Did Pan show good form when he did this to me?
Why, Captain, cutting your hand off was only a childish prank, you might say.
Aye! But throwing it to the crocodile!
That cursed beast liked the taste of me so well... he's followed me ever since, licking his chops... for the rest of me.
And he'd have had you by now, Captain... if he hadn't swallowed that alarm clock.
But now when he's about, he warns ya as ya might say with his tick-tock... tick-tock, tick-tock.
Smee? Smee!
Oh, save me, Smee!
Please, don't let him get me, Smee!
Please, don't let him get me, Smee! Smee!
Here now, shame on ya.
Upsettin' the poor Captain.
There'll be no handouts today.
Shoo now, shoo!
Go on, go on, off it. Off with ya,
I say, go away, go away, out of here.
- Is he gone, Smee?
- Aye, Captain, all clear.
- Nothin' to worry about.
- Oh, Smee, Smee.
I can't stand it any longer.
I tell you, I can't.
Now, now, now, now, Captain.
Just relax.
What you need is a shave.
A nice soothing shave.
There now.
Oh, a pirate's life is a wonderful life
A-sailing over the sea
Give me a career as a--
Captain, you know,
I can't help noticin'... you just ain't been your usual jolly self of late.
Give me a career as a buccaneer
And the crew's gettin' a might uneasy, Captain.
That is, what's left of it.
Now, why don't we put to sea, see? Leave Never Land.
Forget Peter Pan.
There now!
Give me a career as a buccaneer
We'd all be a lot happier, not to mention a lot healthier.
Captain? Oh, dear! I never shaved him this close before.
Now, don't worry, Captain.
I-It must be somewhere about.
Get up, you idiot!
Aye, aye, sir.
Ooh! I found it, Captain.
- Good as new.
- Why, you blithering blockhead!
- Peter Pan ahoy!
- What? What? Where away?
Three points off the starboard bow!
Swoggle me eyes!
It is Pan!
Headed this way with some more of those scurvy brats!
Mr Smee, pipe up the crew!
A-Aye, aye, sir. Uh, pipe up the crew. Uh, pipe up the crew.
All hands on deck!
All hands on deck!
All hands on deck!
All hands on deck!
Look alive, you swabs!
- We've got him this time, Mr Smee.
- That we have, Captain.
Man the Long Tom, you bilge rats!
- I've waited years for this.
- That's not countin' the holidays either.
Double the powder and shorten the fuse!
Shorten the powder and double the fuse!
A pretty sight, Mr Smee.
We'll pot 'em like sitting ducks.
- All right, men! Range 42.
- ""Range 42.''
- Elevation 65.
- ""Elevation 65.''
- Three degrees west.
- ""Three degrees west.''
Steady now! Steady!
Oh, Peter, it's just as
I've always dreamed it would be.
Oh, look,John, there's Mermaid Lagoon.
By Jove!
And the Indian encampment!
Oh, look, there's
Captain Hook and the pirates.
Look out!
Quick, Tink, take Wendy and the boys to the island.
I'll stay here and draw Hook's fire.
Hook! Hook!
You codfish! Here!
Tinker Bell? Not so fast.
Please, Tinker Bell.
We can't keep up with you.
Tinker Bell! Wait!
Ouch!
So!
- Who ya shovin'?
- Who ya shovin'?
- You! That's who!
I'll show you!
Huh? Orders from Pan?
- Hold it, men!
- What's the orders, Tink?
- A terrible what?
- Wendy Bird.
- ""Wendy Bird''?
- Flying this way?
- Uh, Pan's orders are--
What? Smash it?
- Kick it?
- Stomp it?
- Stomp it?
- Oh! Shoot it down!
- Shoot it down!
- Yeah!
- Yeah, shoot it down!
- Come on, follow Tink!
- Follow Tink!
- Let's go!
- Yeah, come on. Let's go then!
- We're gonna get 'er!
- I see it!
- Me too!
- Me too!
Ready, aim... fire!
Oh, Peter, you saved my life.
- Are you hurted, Wendy?
- No, Michael.
Good heavens, Wendy, you might have been killed.
- Hey! Hey! Pan!
- We followed your orders, Pan!
- Hey, Pan, I got it with my skull buster!
- Ya did not! We did!
- I did it, Pan! I did it!
- No, I did!
Attention! Well...
I'm certainly proud of you, you blockheads!
- I bring ya a mother to tell ya stories--
- A mother?
- And you shoot her down.
- Well, Tink said it was a bird!
- Tink said what?
- Well, she said you said to shoot it down!
Tinker Bell. Tink!
Come here. You're charged with high treason, Tink.
Are you guilty or not guilty?
Guilty? But don't ya know ya might have killed her?
Tinker Bell!
I hereby banish you forever.
Please, not forever.
Well, for a week then. Come on, Wendy,
I'll show you the island.
Oh, Peter, uh, the mermaids?
- Aw, let's go huntin'!
- Tigers?
- Naw, bears.
- Naw, bears.
Personally, I should prefer to see the aborigines.
- And the Indians too.
- All right, men!
Go out and capture a few Indians.
-John, you be the leader.
- I shall try to be worthy of my post.
Forward! March!
- Come on, bear.
- Oh, Michael, do be careful.
Come on, Wendy.
I'll show you the mermaids.

Oh, Blackfoot tribe.
Belongs to the Algonquin group.
- Quite savage, you know.
- Uh, let's go get 'em.
- Come on! We'll get 'em!
- Gentlemen, gentlemen.
- First, we must plan our strategy.
- Uh, what's strategy?
A plan of attack. The initial phase is an encircling manoeuvre, thus!
John! Indians! Indians!
Let me in!
Now remember, the Indian is cunning...
- Hey--
- but not intelligent.
Therefore, we simply surround them and take them by surprise--
I'm frightfully sorry, old chaps.
It's all my fault.
- Aw, that's all right, Wildcat.
- Oh, we don't mind.
That's okay.
- How!
- Uh, h-how, Chief!
- How!
For many moons red man fight paleface Lost Boys.
- Ugh.
- Ugh, ugh.
- Sometime you win.
- Sometime we win.
- Okay, Chief.
Uh, you win this time.
Now, turn us loose.
""Turn us loose''?
You mean this is only a game?
Sure! When we win, we turn them loose.
- When they win, they turn us loose.
- They turn us loose.
This time, no turn 'em loose.
- Huh?
- Huh?
- The Chief's a great spoofer.
- Me no spoof'em.
Where you hide
Princess Tiger Lily?
- Uh, Tiger Lily?
- We ain't got your old princess.
- I've certainly never seen her.
- Me neither.
- Honest we don't.
- Heap big lie.
If Tiger Lily not back by sunset... burn 'em at stake.
Just imagine, real live mermaids.
- Would you like to meet 'em?
- Oh, Peter, I'd love to.
All right, come on.
- It's Peter.
- Oh!
- Hello, Peter!
- Hello, Peter!
- Hello, Peter!
- Hello!
Hello, Peter!
- Hello, girls.
- I'm so glad to see you.
Why did you stay away so long?
Did you miss me?
- Tell us one of your adventures.
- Something exciting.
Want to hear about the time
I cut off Hook's hand and threw it to the crocodile?
- Oh, I've always liked that one.
- Me too.
Well, there I was on
Marooner's Rock surrounded...
- Oh, Peter!
- by 40 or 50 pirates.
- Who's she?
Huh? Her?
Oh, that's Wendy.
- A girl?
- What's she doing here?
And in her nightdress too.
Come on, dearie.
Join us for a swim.
- Oh, please, I'm not dressed for it.
- Oh, but you must!
- We insist!
- No, no, please!
- Too good for us, eh?
- Peter!
- If you dare to come near me again--
- Wendy! Wendy!
They were just having a little fun, weren't you, girls?
- That's all.
- We were only trying to drown her.
- Ya see?
- Well, if you think for one minute...
- that I'm going to put up with a--
- Shh. Hold it, Wendy.
- Yep, it's Hook, all right.
- Hook!
- Hook!
Hook! Oh!
Quick, Wendy.
They've captured Tiger Lily.
Looks like they're headin' for Skull Rock.
Come on, Wendy.
Let's see what they're up to.
Now, me dear Princess, this is me proposition.
You tell me the hiding place of Peter Pan... and I shall set you free.
- You dog.
- Poor Tiger Lily.
Am I not a man of me word, Mr Smee?
Oh, yes, always, Captain.
You'd better talk, me dear, for soon the tide will be in... and then it will be too late.
- I'll show the old codfish.
Stay here, Wendy, and watch the fun.
- ""Fun''?
Remember... there is no path through water... to the happy hunting ground.
This is your last chance,
Tiger Lily!
Manatoa, great spirit of mighty seawater, speak!
Beware, Captain Hook!
Beware! Beware!
- Did you hear that, Smee?
- It's an evil spirit, Captain.
Stand by, Smee, while I take a look around.
Spirit of the great seawater, is it?
Psst! Wendy. Watch this.
- Mr Smee!
- Uh, yes, Captain?
Release the princess and take her back to her people.
Aye, aye, sir.
Release the princess--
- But-- But, Captain--
- Those are me orders, Mr Smee!
Aye, aye, sir.
- Well, at last Captain Hook's comin' to his senses.
- Odd's fish!
I told him all along you Indians wouldn't betray Peter Pan.
And just what do you think you are doing, Mr Smee?
Just what you told me, Captain.
Carryin' out your orders.
- My orders?
- Why, yes, Captain.
Didn't you just say to go--
Put her back!
You blithering idiot!
- My orders. Of all the bumbling--
- Mr Smee!
Just exactly what do you think you are doing?
Putting her back like you said, Captain.
I said nothing of the sort!
Oh, but, C-Captain, d-d-didn't you?
I thought that--
For the last time, Mr Smee.
Take the princess back to her people.
Understand? Understand?
Understand? Understand?
- Uh, aye, aye, sir.
- Oh, and one more thing.
When you return to the ship, tell the whole crew... to help themselves to me best rum.
- Peter!
- Here's your spirit, Smee!
Why, it's Peter Pan.
- Scurvy brat!
- Thank you, Captain.
Come down, boy, if you've a taste for cold steel.
- Watch this, Wendy.
- Oh, Peter, do be careful.
- Try your luck, Mr Smee?
- Let him have it!
Well, come on, you idiot!
Blast him!
Right here, Mr Smee.
Hold it, you fool!
No! No!
Captain?
Oh, how dreadful.
What a pity, Mr Smee.
I'm afraid we've lost the dear Captain.
Captain!
In the back, Captain?
Give it to him, Captain!
Cleave him to the brisket.
I've got you this time, Pan.
Well, well, a codfish on a hook.
I'll get you for this, Pan, if it's the last thing I do!
I say, Captain, do you hear something?
No.
No!
No!
Mr Crocodile, do you like codfish?
- You do?
- Oh, Peter, no!
No!
- Smee!
- D-Don't go away, Captain!
Uh, stay right there now, sir.
I'll save ya, sir.
Smee!
Smee!
Smee!
Ow!
Captain! Captain!
Smee! Smee!
- Give him back!
- Smee--
Row for the ship!
Row for the ship--
Whoa!
Smee!
Peter, what about Tiger Lily?
Tiger Lily?
Oh, Tiger Lily.
Help--
Peter. Wait for me.
That cursed Peter Pan.
Making a fool out of me.
Oh, my head.
Oh, a pirate's life is a wonderful life
- Your hot water, Mr Smee.
- Shh!
The poor Captain has a splitting headache.
We mustn't annoy him.
Well, Captain, it's nice to see you smiling again.
Brings back the good old days when we was leadin' a healthy, normal life.
Scuttlin' ships, cuttin' throats.
Oh, Captain... why don't we put to sea again?
You know, there's trouble brewin' on the island.
Women trouble.
I wouldn't want this to go any farther, but... the cook told me that the first mate told him... that he heard that Pan has banished Tinker Bell.
Whoa!
Why, you doddering imbecile, I--
Did you say Pan... has banished Tinker Bell?
Aye, aye, Captain.
That he has.
- But why?
- Well, on account of Wendy, Captain.
Tink tried to do her in, she did.
Tink's terrible jealous.
- Well, well.
- That's why we ought to leave, Captain.
This ain't no place for a respectable pirate.
That's it, Smee!
That's it!
I'm glad you agrees, Captain.
Quick, me coat.
Me best dress coat.
Aye, aye, sir. The sooner we get going, the better.
Ah, yes, a jealous female can be tricked into anything.
- My case of hooks!
- Aye, aye, sir.
Here you are, sir.
Your Sunday set, sir.
If we impress the pixie, convince her we're eager to help her... the wench may chart our course to a... certain hiding place.
Our best hiding place is the Spanish main, sir.
I'll set our course--
And where do you think you are going?
T-To tell the boys we sails with the tide, sir.
You will go ashore, pick up Tinker Bell... and bring her to me.
Understand?
Aye, aye, s-s-s-sir.
- How!
- How!
What's the Chief doing,John?
He's delivering an oration in sign language.
- What's he saying?
- He says...
""Peter Pan, mighty warrior.
""Save Tiger Lily.
Make big Chief heap glad.''
Well, he certainly doesn't look ""heap glad.''
Make Peter Pan heap big chief.
You now Little Flying Eagle.
- Hurray for Flying Eagle! Flying Eagle!
- Hurray!
Hurray!
- Oh, how wonderful!
- Hurray!
Teach 'em paleface brother all about red man.
Good, this should be most enlightening.
Uh, what makes the red man red?
- When did he first say, ""Ugh''?
- First say, ""Ugh''?
Why does he ask you, ""How''?
""Why does he ask you, 'How'?''
Hana mana ganda

Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda
Once the Injun didn't know all the things that he know now
But the Injun

Let's go back a million years to the very first Injun prince
He kissed a maid and start to blush and we've all been blushin'since

Squaw take 'em papoose.
Wa-hoo!

- Squaw, get 'em firewood.
Squaw no get 'em firewood!
Squaw go home.
Beggin' your pardon, Miss Bell... but Captain Hook would like a word with ya.
Yes, Miss Bell,
Captain Hook admits defeat.
Tomorrow I leave the island, never to return.
I'm glad to hear that, Captain.
I'll tell the crew and--
And that's why I asked you over, me dear... to tell Peter
I bear him no ill will.
Oh, Pan has his faults, to be sure.
Uh, bringing that Wendy to the island, for instance.
Dangerous business, that.
Why, rumour has it that already she has come between you and Peter.
But what's this?
Tears?
Then it is true.
Oh, Smee.
The way of a man with a maid.
Taking the best years of her life and then... casting her aside like an old glove!
Ain't it a bloomin' shame?
But we mustn't judge
Peter too harshly, me dear.
It's that Wendy who's to blame.
Mr Smee, we must save the lad from himself.
But how?
We've so little time.
We sail in the morning.
Sail! That's it, Smee!
- We'll shanghai Wendy.
- ""Shanghai Wendy,'' Captain?
Take her to sea with us.
With her gone, Peter will soon forget this mad infatuation.
Come, Smee, we must leave immediately.
Surround Peter's home--
But, Captain, we-- we don't know where Peter Pan lives!
Great Scott, you're right, Smee!
What's that, my dear?
You could show us the way?
Why, I never thought of that.
- Take this down, Smee.
- ""Take this down, Smee.''
Aye, aye, Captain.
- Start at Pegleg Point.
- ""Start at Pegleg Point.''
- Forty paces west of Blindman's Bluff.
- ""Blindman's Bluff.''
Yes, yes. Hop, skip and a jump across Crocodile Creek.
Then north by northeast, one, two, three.
Well, get on with it--
Continue, my dear.
I mustn't harm Peter?
Madam, Captain Hook gives his word... not to lay a finger... or a hook on Peter Pan.
Ah, Hangman's Tree.
So that's the entrance to his hiding place.
Thank you, me dear.
You've been most helpful.

Big Chief Flying Eagle greets his braves.
- How!
- Uh, how, Chief.
- How, Chief! How!
- How.
- How.
Big Chief greets Little Mother.
- How!
- Ugh!
Aw, Wendy, is that all you have to say?
- Everyone else thinks I'm wonderful.
- Especially Tiger Lily.
- Tiger Lily?
-John! Michael!
Take off that war paint and get ready for bed.
- Bed?
- Brave no sleep.
Go for days without sleep.
- But, boys, we're going home in the morning.
- Home!
- And--
- Oh, Wendy, we don't want to go home.
No go home. Stay many moons.
Have heap big time.
Now, Peter, let's stop pretending and be practical.
Chief Flying Eagle has spoken.
Oh, for goodness sake.
Please, boys.
Do you want to stay here and grow up like-- like savages?
- Of course.
- But you can't.
You need a mother.
We all do.
Aren't you our mother, Wendy?
Why, Michael, of course not!
Surely you haven't forgotten our real mother!
Did she have silky ears and wear a fur coat?
Oh, no, Michael.
That was Nana.
I think I had a mother once.
- What was she like?
- What was she like?
- I forget.
- I had a white rat!
- That's no mother!
Hey, who ya shovin'?
No, no, boys! Please.
I'll tell you what a mother is.
- Yeah, tell us.
- Yeah, tell us.
- Please, Wendy.
Well, a mother, a real mother... is the most wonderful person in the world.
She's the angel voice... that bids you good night... kisses your cheek... whispers, ""Sleep tight.''
Your mother
And mine
Your mother
And mine
The helping hand that guides you along
Whether you're right
Whether you're wrong
Your mother
And mine
Your mother
And mine
What makes mothers all that they are
Might as well ask what makes a star
Ask your heart to tell you her worth
Your heart will say
Heaven on earth
- Another word
- Shh.
For divine
Your mother
And mine
- I wanna see my mother.
- Yes, Michael.
I propose we leave for home at once.
- Could I go too? Huh, Wendy?
- Me too, Wendy!
- Come on! Let me go!
All right, boys. All right. I'm sure
Mother would be glad to have you.
Uh, that is, if Peter doesn't mind.
Go on!
Go back and grow up!
But I'm warning ya.
Once you're grown up... you can never come back!
- Never!
- Dear.
- Well, then, shall we be off?
- Yeah, come on. Let's go!
- Yeah!
- See ya, Peter.
They'll be back.
Peter.
Goodbye, Peter.
All right, men.
Take them away.
And now, Smee, to take care of Master Peter Pan.
But, Captain, wouldn't it be more humane-like to slit his throat?
Aye, that it would, Mr Smee.
But I have given me word not to lay a finger... or a hook on Peter Pan.
And Captain Hook never breaks a promise.
Yo ho, yo ho
Yo ho, yo ho, yo ho
So try the life of a thief
Just sample the life of a crook

Join up with Captain Hook
- Hey, I wanna join!
- Please! Oh, boy!
- I wanna be a pirate!
- Oh, boy! A pirate!
Boys! Aren't you ashamed of yourselves?
But Captain Hook is most insistent, Wendy.
Yeah! He says we'll walk the plank if we don't.
Oh, no, we won't.
Peter Pan will save us.
Peter Pan will save them, Smee.
Peter Pan will save them.
Oh, Captain, you did it.
But a thousand pardons, my dear.
I don't believe you are in on our little joke.
You see, we left a present for Peter.
Sort of a surprise package, you might say.
Why, I can see our little friend at this very moment... reading the tender inscription.
""To Peter, with love from Wendy.
Do not open till 6 o'clock.''
Huh. I wonder what's in it.
Could he but see within the package... he would find an ingenious little device.
Set, so that when the clock is like this...
Peter Pan will be blasted... out of Never Land forever.
No!
But time grows short.
We have but 1 8 seconds.
Fifteen seconds.
Thirteen seconds.
Twelve seconds.
Well, I guess
I can open it now.
Hey, Tink.
Look what Wendy left.
Hey, stop that! Stop it!
What's the matter with you?
Hook? A bomb?
Don't be ridiculous!
And so passeth a worthy opponent.
Amen.
Hook! It was a bomb!
Why, if it hadn't been for Tink-- Tinker Bell!
Tink? Tinker Bell?
Where are you, Tink?
Tink? Tinker Bell!
Tink. Are you all right?
Wendy? The boys?
But I've gotta save you first.
Hold on, Tink! Hold on!
Don't go out.
Don't you understand, Tink?
You mean more to me than anything in this whole world!
And now, which will it be?
The pen or the plank?
Captain Hook, we will never join your crew.
As you wish.
Ladies first, my dear.
- Goodbye, boys.
- Goodbye, Wendy.
- Goodbye, Wendy.
- Be brave,John.
- I shall strive to, Wendy.
- Goodbye, Michael.
- Goodbye, Wendy.
- Come on!
- Get along over there!
- Get going, miss. Get going!
Don't give us no trouble!
Go on! Go on!
Get it over with!
- Move along!
- The Captain's waitin'!
Wendy! Wendy!
- Captain, n-no splash.
- Not a sound.
- Not a bloomin' ripple.
- It's a jinx, that's what it is.
- No splash.
- No sign of the wench.
- Did you hear a splash?
- I'm telling you, mates, it's a black day.
Mark me words.
We'll all pay for this.
The ship is bewitched.
No splash, Captain.
So, you want a splash, Mr Starkey.
I'll give you a splash!
- Who's next?
- You're next, Hook!
- This time you've gone too far!
- It's Pan! Peter Pan!
- And Wendy!
- It can't be!
It's his blinkin' ghost what's talkin'!
Say your prayers, Hook.
I'll show you this ghost has blood in his veins.
I'll run him through! Ooh!
Take that!
Curse this hook!
Come on, everybody!
Hurry, Michael! Hurry!
Don't stand there, you bilge rats!
Get those scurvy brats!
After the brats, men!
This is no mere boy.
'Tis some fiend fighting me.
A flying devil!
- Hold your fire.
- Get 'em!
Steady, men. Steady.
- Club 'em with the marline.
- Fire!
- I'll crack their bloomin' skulls!
- Let me at 'em!
Down, you blackguard!
Hurray!
- Right through, Michael.
- Yea, Bear Killer!
- Yea for Bear Killer!
Fly! Fly! Fly! You coward!
Coward? Me?
Ha-ha-ha! You wouldn't dare fight old Hook man-to-man!
You'd fly away like a cowardly sparrow!
Nobody calls Pan a coward and lives!
I'll fight you man-to-man, with one hand behind my back.
- You mean you won't fly?
- No, don't, Peter! It's a trick!
- I give my word, Hook.
- Good, then let's have at it!
Now! Insolent youth, prepare to die!
Fly! Fly, Peter! Fly!
No! I gave my word.
You're mine, Hook!
Cleave him to the brisket!
You wouldn't do old Hook in now, would you, lad?
I'll go away forever.
I'll do anything you say.
Well, all right.
If ya say you're a codfish.
- I'm a codfish.
- Louder!
- I'm a codfish!
- Hurray!
Hook is a codfish
A codfish, a codfish
-Hook is a codfish, a codfish, a codfish
-All right, Hook... you're free to go, and never return.
Peter!
Smee! Smee!
Smee!
Smee! Smee!
Smee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee!
Captain!
Captain! Captain!
Hurray!
Hurray for Captain Pan!
All right, ya swabs, aloft with ya!
We're castin' off!
Heave those halyards!
But, but, Peter--
Oh, that is, Captain Pan.
- At your service, madam.
- Could you tell me, sir, where we're sailing?
- To London, madam.
- Oh, Peter.
Michael!John!
We're going home!
Man the capstan!
Hoist anchor!
Pixie dust!
George, I am so glad you changed your mind about Wendy.
After all, she's still a child.
Oh, pshaw, Mary.
You know I never mean those things.
Do I, Nana?
Oh! Wendy!
Wendy, what on earth are you doing there?
Mmm. Hmm?
- Oh, Mother, we're back!
- Back?
All except the Lost Boys.
They weren't quite ready.
- Lost Bo-- Ready?
- To grow up.
That's why they went back to Never Land.
- Never Land?
- Yes, but I am.
- Uh, ""am''?
- Uh, ready to grow up.
Oh! Oh! Uh--
Well, my dear, all in good time.
- After all, perhaps we were too--
- Oh, but, Mother... it was such a wonderful adventure.
Tinker Bell and the mermaids and Peter Pan.
Oh, he was the most wonderful of all.
- Why, why, even when we were kidnapped, I--
- Kidnapped!
Mm-hmm. I knew Peter Pan would save us, and he did.
And we all called him a codfish!
Uh, Captain Hook, I mean.
And then we sailed away on a ship in the sky.
Hmm. Mary, I'm going to bed.
Oh, Mother.
He really is wonderful, isn't he?
See how well he sails the ship.
- George. George!
- Now what, Mary?
Nana, d-did you see--
You know, I have the strangest feeling... that I've seen that ship before.
A long time ago... when I was very young.
- George, dear.
- Father.
When there's a smile in your heart
There's no better time to start
Think of all thejoy you'll find
When you leave the world behind
And bid your cares goodbye
You can fly
You can fly
You can fly

Praise be to Thee, my Lord, through all Thy creatures...
...especially brother Sun, who illuminates the day.
And beautiful is he and radiant with great splendour.
Of thee, most High, he bears the likeness.
Praise be my Lord, for sister Moon and for the stars.
In heaven, Thou hast formed them luminous, precious and fair.
A Rizzoli production
Praise be my Lord, for brother Wind,
...and for the air and clouds, and all the weather...
...through which you give all Thy creatures nourishment.
Inspired by the"Fioretti" of San Francesco
Praise be my Lord, for sister Water,
...she is greately helpful, humble, precious, and pure.
Praise be my Lord, for brother Fire...
Interpreted by non-professional actors
...through whom Thou illuminate the night...
The role of The Tyrant Nicolaio played by Aldo Fabrizi,
...and who is fair, cheerful, powerful and strong.
Praise be my Lord, for our sister, Mother Earth, who sustains us and governs us... and brings forth diverse fruits with coloured flowers and herbs.
Praise be my Lord, for those who forgive for Thy love...
...and bear suffering and trial.
Blessed those who shall in peace endure,
...for by Thee, most High, they will be crowned.
Praise be my Lord, for our sister, bodily death
...from whom no living man can escape.
Woe to them who die in mortal sin.
Blessed be those who she finds in Thy most holy will,
...for the second death shall not harm them.
God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise,
Praise and bless my Lord, and the weak things of the world to confound the things that are mighty
...and serve him with great humility.
Paul. I Corinthians, 2:27
To conquer the world,
Francesco became humble and a clown to merit the Kingdom of Heaven.
Everyone mocked him and said he was mad.
But Pope Innocent III let him preach to the people, his faith in gentleness and poverty.
Now Francesco is returning from
Rome with his companions.
Their hut is occupied. They go on to Santa Maria degli Angeli.
From there they will take to the world the power of their meekness and their sweet love of peace.
"If I were preaching,
I'd begin like this:"
I've come to tell you a big secret that will make you happy.
I'll teach you how to find real peace.
And joy!
And joy! Because joy and peace are what men most desire.
I'd talk of glory. We should have the spirit of the perfect knight.
He wishes us to preach the word of God with charity.
Ardour springs from a heart full of joy.
I think a Christian should love to struggle.
It's great to struggle for a cherished dream.
You mean virtue? The joy I mean is what the soul has when it can dominate the passions that trouble it.
Remember how calm it was those starry nights when dreams enchanted our youth?
Then the weather broke the spell that could have harmed us.
Now the Pope has blessed us, we must make known this new reality.
The joy we feel today is from this struggle... which divine Providence has inspired us to.
But why, Brother Bernardo, don't you show us how to behave to achieve such peace of soul?
You should imitate Christ in His poverty and humility!
Let there be joy! Let there be glory!
Let people rediscover the joy of loving!
Slowly, brother. Were you thirsty?
But why you? Why you?
What do you mean?
Why does everyone follow you, Francesco?
Why do they all want to see you, hear you, and obey you?
You're not tall, handsome, or noble!
Because God could find no lower creature on earth nor a sinner worse than I, in order to show that all virtue and good comes from Him, not us.
Glory be His name for all eternity!
That's why I follow you, too, Francesco!
Someone's in there.
- What do you want?
- We need to rest, brother.
Bring my donkey back in.
I'll give you rest!
- But we built this hut ourselves.
- Now it's mine.
That is hardly charitable.
Save your breath. Get out!
I'll teach you to bother me!
Get out, you thieving bastards!
Come, Bernardo, Leone lambs of the good Lord, come!
- Now where do we go?
- I know.
Shouldn't we be rejoicing in our hearts?
It's the first time Providence has made us useful to someone else.
Father, what's bothering you?
God forgive me for abusing your obedience. Bernardo,
I command you, on your holy vows, to do what I ask.
I'll obey you, I will do all you ask.
What must I do?
You must punish my pride.
I'll lie down. Step on my face and neck, saying:
"Lie there, wretch whose pride imposes penance on his brothers!"
The joy in our faces is your best answer to God.
We're beginning to love our vocation!
Now we see by following you, we follow God.
Thank you, brothers.
The Lord is always good to me.
How brother Ginepro returned naked to Santa Maria degli Angeli where the brothers had finished building their hut.
Ah! How I long to go and preach!
Brother, this work brings you ever nearer to God.
If you work with your hands, you know life deeply.
Put thought into each stone, and each will magnify you.
What a lovely present!
What shall we do with them?
Now we need some sheep!
- Who gave them to you?
- A benefactor.
Let's put them on the altar!
At last we have bells to call us to prayer.
We've another surprise! We've finished our house. Come and see!
It's a bit cramped.
Brother Ginepro, what happened?
I gave my habit to a beggar.
But you musn't give away your habit.
Didn't you tell us to help the poor?
I command you not to give away your habit again!
How Giovanni The Simple asked to follow Francesco, and imitate him in gesture and word.
Francesco, we're setting out.
Father, help me form these sons into a new and humble people.
May this new time be like that which saw your Son's meekness.
Let there be peace among men.
In the name of the Lord, go in meekness and honesty.
Pray God in your hearts, and shun empty words and deeds.
Each one help the other.
If you come across anyone who needs you, forget everything else.
If you don't help others on earth, you can't hope for God's reward.
Brothers, take care not to waste the most precious gift of time nor appear lazy in others' eyes.
I want my brothers to do honest work and not burden others.
Make those who don't know the Gospels learn from your example.
As Ginepro has no clothes, he will cook you a nice dinner.
We'll bring him a silken habit.
Farewell until this evening.
- We'll spread joy!
Lord, make me an instrument of your peace.
Let me bring love where there is hate, unity where there is discord.
Let me bring joy where there is pain, and hope where there is despair.
Make me love, not wish for love.
And let all on earth know the secret of your peace which is the fruit of justice and fraternal charity.
Sing a little quieter.
Our Father who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come
Little brothers, who praise God so easily, because you fly so freely now let me, too, praise God in peace.
Thy Kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven
Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. So it is.
Anyone there?
What do you want, brother?
- Oh, you're beautiful!
What do you want?
To speak to your leader.
Speak to me, it's the same.
I want to join Francesco.
And the bull?
It's for the brothers.
That's ours. Grandpa's gone mad.
We can't give away a cow.
- I'll see to the old man.
- Yes, you keep him.
Here we walk with Jesus and the Madonna.
- Can you pray?
- I know the Hail Mary.
See how beautiful! Do you like it?
We always pray here.
- Do you like them?
- Beautiful.
The lamp is out. Well, we'll light it tomorrow.
- What are you doing?
- The oil is beautiful.
Let us pray.
How peaceful it is.
This is where we sleep.
The fire is dying.
Beautiful fire!
Why stint brother Fire?
I love him because he's beautiful and strong.
Praise God for brother Sun by day and brother Fire by night.
But father, fire can hurt you.
And you, why do you want to hurt brother Fire?
Father, let me do it.
- Why aren't the others back yet?
- Be patient, they'll come.
I want to be like Francesco.
But why did you leave your wife and children? Were they unkind?
No, I want to be like Francesco.
With us, you must work harder still.
Your family must be as dead to you.
You must be humble and pray.
Will it not be hard to leave your family? What do you want of Francesco?
I want to be a saint like him.
I am Francesco!
Let's go out.
Your new brothers are returning from a day's work.
This is our new brother.
So many gifts from God!
- Take these, Ginepro!
Sister Chiara sent this habit for brother Ginepro. It's been so long, and she wants to eat with you.
May she come here?
Do you think I should let her?
So, tell sister Chiara we await her.
Here, Ginepro. God never abandons those who serve Him.
Why are you so sad?
We are great sinners. The Lord wouldn't grant us alms today.
Never fear, those who do their duty will never go in want.
What our brothers brought back is for all of us.
Look, we have a new brother!
His name's Giovanni.
Santa Chiara's wonderful meeting, with San Francesco at
Santa Maria degli Angeli.
- We'll never do it!
- Don't worry, we have time.
Don't break the branches, just take the flowers.
- Want to climb onto my shoulders?
- Lf you steady me.
And we thought we had nothing.
Pick plenty for sister Chiara.
We're making a beautiful carpet.
Smell it!
Good. Let's prepare a house fit for a girl consecrated to God.
Go trim your beard!
Take the buckets.
- And you?
- Father, I don't have to shave.
Now we'll clean you up.
Ack! That hurts.
- Gently, gently.
She is coming!
Sister Chiara's coming!
Hello sister Chiara!
Hello sister Chiara!
So many memories!
Sister Chiara consecrated herself to God in this chapel.
She's beautiful.
He took my cloak!
Hush! Brother Ginepro has no clothes.
Didn't Francesco order you not to give your habit away again?
Yes, but I met a man who begged in God's name.
I couldn't give him this ricotta, so I said:
"I have only this habit, and I have sworn not to give it away but if you take it off my back
I won't stop you."
That's my cloak
Be charitable. He was naked, we covered him.
Take this to a needy brother.
You take it, please.
Last night the devil visited me again.
But he went away unhorned, because
I've a simple way to drive him off,
When he's near, I rush to close the door to my heart, and envelop myself in holy meditation.
So when he knocks,
I reply from within:
"Keep out, evil one, there's no room for you here!"
Defeated, the devil leaves me, and the land.
My God!
And the people of Assisi saw the horizon red with fire.
They ran to Santa Maria degli Angeli thinking it was burning.
The sky was alight with glowing words of love from God, Chiara, and Francesco.
How brother Ginepro cut off a pig's trotter to give to a sick brother.
I always have to stay here.
But that's fine.
One of our brothers is weak from too much fasting.
I've made soup. Will it do him good?
Doesn't it smell good?
I doubt he can eat it, but I'll take it to him.
Brother, I've made food that'd raise the dead.
Thank you, brother.
In your condition, you shouldn't fast.
Father Francesco would order you to eat.
I do not fast to mortify my flesh.
You fast too much. I know what you would like.
A leg of chicken.
Or a trout, some sausages, a fresh egg and ricotta.
So, what would you like?
It'd be a big comfort if you'd bring me a pig's trotter.
Leave it to me.
I'll go and find one.
He wouldn't eat but he wants a pig's foot.
Where?
With God's help I'll find a pig who'll offer me his trotter.
Give me the knife.
Let's trust in God.
Brother piglets, the Lord has sent you to help me.
Brother pig, please listen.
You who are the most beautiful give your succulent trotter for a sick brother?
It won't hurt. The Lord will help us.
Think, little brother, how rarely we can do good!
Thank you, Lord, for the good the pig and I can do.
You found one!
Listen, he's also thanking the Lord!
I've brought you a trotter.
What a lovely smell!
Robbers! Thieves! You cut off my pig's leg! That's what you call doing good?
Calmly, brother. What is it?
One of you cut off my pig's leg.
- Forgive us. Did you see who did it?
- No, or I'd have cracked his skull.
You've done it again!
You're a simpleton.
But, I did something good.
What made you do such a thing?
Brother pig and I were only doing good.
The pig was happy, too, wasn't he, Giovanni?
I command you to run and beg that man's pardon, and promise we won't trouble him again.
Don't be stingy with your repentence!
What a forest of hair!
A lovely forest for God!
You needn't feel sorry for brother pig because he helped my sick brother.
To help a sick brother!
Aren't you pleased?
Eat it, you vagabonds! But if I see you again, I'll flay you!
I told you I'd soothed him.
We can give it to the poor!
Yes, I'll see to it.
How San Francesco, praying in the forest at night, met the leper.
My God, my all!
God, crucified
My brothers and I love you.
Crucified
My God!
How brother Ginepro cooked food for fifteen days and Francesco, touched by his zeal, gave him permission to preach.
I've got an idea!
Now that we have so much food let's cook it all at once, then it'll last fifteen days,
So we'll be able to go and preach, too!
I think Francesco will be happy, too.
And also the poor.
Where will we find a big enough pot?
Ask the shepherds.
Good idea. I'll go and look, with God's help.
- And for Francesco.
Help me. Put in lots of greens.
Get the wood now.
- What are you doing?
- The wood.
No, put the vegetables in!
Ginepro, the fire is dying, bring more wood!
Ginepro's cooking tonight.
Don't put the wood in, you'll ruin it!
Francesco! Beautiful Francesco!
I'm making dinner for fifteen days, so we can all go preaching.
The chicken in this soup will nourish us, then we can forget about meals, we can preach!
Come here, Ginepro.
You may preach, but I command you to begin your sermons thus:
"Baa, baa, baa, much I say, little I do."
For it is better to preach with example than with words.
How brother Ginepro was sentenced to death, and how his humility conquered the ferocity of the tyrant Nicolaio.
Let me have a go. Sit on the other end.
Where did you get the helmet?
Nicolaio's soldiers left it.
The tyrant is besieging Viterbo.
- Since when?
- Three months.
He's still there? I must seize this opportunity.
He'll win again.
No, he's got less blood than I have.
- I bet he can't fill the cup.
- I bet he can.
Baa, baa, baa, much I say, little I do.
Thank you, Lord. Finally
I understand, that souls are won not by words, but by example.
- What's happening?
- A game.
Let's go and watch!
What's going on?
They're having fun with a beggar.
Bring him here.
Search him.
An awl and a flint.
Beat him, then kill him.
I'll try it.
What have you done to this damned armour? It's digging into my neck.
Do something, you dogs!
The last time you cut off the feet instead of the head.
Will you kill him without a priest of his faith?
Call that one who buries the bodies.
Why a priest? He'll die, anyway.
Give him some wine instead.
Play music. He'll manage to die, just the same.
Such a little mouse! Trying to kill our leader!
Go away.
My son, I bring you the comfort of our faith.
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.
Who are you?
A sinner.
What sins?
Many, many!
- Where are you from?
- Assisi.
Your name?
Ginepro. Why?
Do you follow, that Francesco who's gentle like a mother?
And meek as a lamb.
In God's name! I know this boy, he's a friend of all. I'll talk to Nicolaio.
Lord Nicolaio, an injustice!
They're killing an innocent!
What's that? What do you want?
Nibbio, raise this visor!
Raise it at once!
What innocent?
The man you just condemned.
That worm threatened my life.
Nibbio, show him the instruments.
But this is to make fire, and the awl is for mending his sandals.
A spy warned me of an assassin with such tools, dressed like a beggar.
This is a devilish conspiracy!
No, I know him.
He is a follower of Francesco, a poor man - the son of a rich man.
He gave everything to the poor, and lives with companions in a forest, free as birds.
Many follow him, because he loves even the lowly.
He who despises the world is full of hate, and thus, poisonous.
No, does not Aristotle say that, he who despises the world does so to protect himself from pain?
The poor are all the same. They preach poverty, rob you, then slit your throat.
No! They refuse everything.
They're incapable of doing harm.
So, bring him here. I want to question him.
Tell me, who are you?
- I'm a very great sinner.
Take off this helmet, Nibbio!
Would you betray us to Viterbo?
I'm the greatest traitor, unworthy of anything.
Were you going to kill me with that awl, and set fire to the camp?
I?
I'm a very great sinner.
I'd do worse things if God didn't protect me.
If this is Ginepro what must Francesco be like?
See the truth in his words!
Before God, we're always guiltier than others can tell, because we are not grateful to God and because we do not love our fellow men.
We would be even more guilty but for the help of merciful God.
- I don't understand this talk.
Nor I. Get this armour off me!
Take him to my tent.
Sound the call!
End the siege!
How brother Francesco taught brother Leone what perfect happiness is.
Brother Leone, lamb of God, even if we could make the blind see the deaf hear, exorcise demons, and raise the dead - this is not perfect happiness.
Did you see? He was after my gold, but I punished him.
Brother, is a little gold worth a man's life?
Here, take this coin.
Rest in peace.
- Amen.
O brother Leone, lamb of God, even if we knew the language of the angels, the soul's secrets, this is not perfect happiness.
Even if we could predict the future, and know nature's secrets, this is not perfect happiness.
Were we to convert all to Christ, this is not perfect happiness.
Tell me, where is perfect happiness?
Oh, here's a house. Let's see if they'll praise Christ with us!
God, in his mercy, will surely show us where perfect happiness is.
Be charitable, brother. We poor monks roam the world for love of others.
We'll help you serve Jesus.
Serve Jesus with us!
Go away! Stop bothering people!
Brother, be charitable!
Serve Jesus, brother!
I'll give you Jesus! Get out, thieves!
I'll be generous! I'll give you every inch of this stick of mine!
If you want more, come back and disturb a man in his own house.
Brother Leone, lamb of God, now that we've suffered all this for Christ it is perfect happiness.
Above all the graces which Christ gives
His followers is the grace to conquer oneself and to endure suffering for love of Him.
Only in this is perfect happiness!
How San Francesco left Santa Maria degli Angeli with his brothers and went through the world to preach peace.
They're coming!
We found few people to accept our alms:
They say we're poor.
We leave our garden in your hands.
We leave you everything: Oil, bread, nuts. Not much, but all yours.
Please care for our chapel, because we are going away to preach.
I can't come, not with this cloak.
True, apostles have no cloaks or shoes.
You've more than you need, give them away.
Happy? You need a cowl.
God bless you! I take only my faith with me, I leave you my heart.
Farewell, brother Nightingale.
Farewell, shady brother Tree.
Farewell, blessed earth.
Farewell, little house.
Farewell, Santa Maria degli Angeli.
Some for us, some we give to the poor.
Take everything. Even my stick.
Come here, Father.
Bring the gifts.
The Lord bless you.
Brothers, I have nothing left.
Nor have I, and I have fifteen children.
We've given everything, now let us thank God.
Father Silvestro, you're a priest, say the blessing.
O my Lord, my hope is in You.
Send us help from on high!
Show us Your paths.
Teach us Your way.
Guide our steps.
Giovanni, we're waiting for you.
The time has come for us to separate for each to go and preach alone.
Father, which way do we go?
- God will show us.
How shall we know God's will?
I command you to spin around, like children playing, until your head is dizzy.
Not dizzy yet?
Still not dizzy?
Now I'm dizzy!
Ah, my head's spinning!
In which direction did you fall?
Towards Siena.
Towards Florence.
Towards Arezzo.
Towards Pisa.
Towards Spoleto.
Towards Foligno.
Where did you fall, Giovanni?
Towards that finch dancing on the trees.
Then follow that bird, and the road the Lord has shown you.
So, my sons, spread throughout the world and preach peace. Farewell.
Pyewacket.
What's the matter with me?
Why do I feel this way?
It's such a rut.
The same old thing, day after day.
The same old people.
I know I'm feeling sorry for myself, but it's true.
Why don't you give me something for Christmas, Pye?
What would I like?
I'd like to do something different.
I'd like to meet someone different.
Look, there's that man upstairs.
He's different.
Why don't I ever know people like that?
Why don't you give me him for Christmas?
Why don't you give me him?
Oh, dear!
- You startled me.
- We're even.
- Who are you?
- You do have a nice place here.
Thank you. Would you mind if I ask what you're doing in it?
Certainly not. I was going downstairs...
...and your door happened to be open, and I saw your window open, too.
The snow was coming through...
...and I thought you'd like me to close it, so I did.
It's odd I had to unlock the door to get in.
Yes, isn't it?
After all, you are fairly new in the building.
I was only being neighbourly.
Are you the one that lives above me?
Tell me something.
Do you study dramatics, by any chance?
Dramatics?
At night, I hear you through the ceiling, as I'm trying to sleep.
Sounds as though you're reciting or something.
- Can you understand what I say?
- No.
I'll try not to do it so loudly.
You read, don't you?
And you have such a correspondence.
I straightened your desk up a bit.
I'm afraid you're very sloppy.
If you don't mind terribly,
I have some telephoning to do.
Some personal telephoning.
Before you moved in, a theosophist lived here, and he was very pleasant.
Very pleasant.
Hello? Mother?
I'm sorry to bother you.
I'm Shepperd Henderson. I live above.
- I know. I'm Gillian Holroyd.
- How do you do?
My phone's out of order.
I wonder if I might use yours.
- I'm late for an appointment.
- Certainly. Come in.
Thank you.
It's in the back.
- You reading this?
- Magic in Mexico? Yes.
- Are you interested in that sort of thing?
- Only professionally. I'm a publisher.
Operator? I'd like to report a phone out of order.
- Did you publish that?
- No, but I wish I had.
- It sold like the Kinsey Report.
- I can't think why. It's completely phoney.
- It is?
- I spent a year in Mexico.
I'm sure they fed him a lot of fake tourist stuff, and he swallowed it whole.
Maybe they did that to Kinsey, too.
I certainly wish I'd put this one out.
I understand Redlitch is about ready to change publishers.
Yes, I'll wait.
- Would you like to meet him?
- You know him?
No, but I might know someone who does.
I understand he's a drunk and a nut, but there's a market for the supernatural.
- Yes, I'd like very much to meet him.
- I'll see if I can arrange it sometime.
Thank you.
Supervisor? My number is
Chickering 4-5-0-9-9, and it's out of order.
I don't know what's wrong with it.
If you want my opinion, I think it's sick.
No matter what I dial,
I get nothing but these idiotic sounds.
That's just it. They're not mechanical.
They're more human, or inhuman.
Maybe it is goblins.
I know it sounds strange, but I want it fixed.
A Merry Christmas to you, too.
Perhaps you need a drink.
I'm in an awful hurry.
Maybe I can have a rain check.
Certainly.
Here we are.
This is a fascinating shop. What's this?
That's a Bayaka mask, from the Belgian Congo.
Looks like a German governess I had.
How did you ever get interested in all this?
I majored in anthropology at college.
Gillian, you've got to change your mind and come along.
- I didn't know you had company.
- This is Shepperd Henderson.
- This is my aunt, Miss Holroyd.
- Your aunt?
Mr. Henderson and I saw each other a little earlier.
- I'm afraid he thinks I've been naughty.
- No, not exactly.
Gillian, you can't stay in tonight.
All our friends will be at the Zodiac.
- Mr. Henderson, persuade her for me.
- The Zodiac? I don't think I know it.
I don't imagine you would.
It's kind of a dive.
But it's fun. Coax her for me.
- Is it fun?
- It certainly can be.
Then you oughtn't stay home
Christmas Eve.
Thanks again for the phone, and Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas!
- I think you like him.
- Yes, I do. Very much.
- Did you bring him here?
- No, he came to use the phone.
- You broke into his apartment, didn't you?
- I didn't break in, dear.
And you fixed his phone.
I'm angry with you, Queenie.
Really angry. You promised.
I promised to be careful.
Besides, it serves him right.
He wasn't nice to me at all, and what harm did I do?
I didn't take anything.
All right, I read his letters.
Really, Queenie.
But it's not as if I were going to make use of them.
It's too bad, though, he's getting married, isn't it?
He's getting married? How do you know?
One of his letters, I suppose.
- Well, that rules him out.
- I don't see why.
- I don't take other women's men.
- But it would be so easy.
And it would be such good practice for you, darling.
And he'd never suspect.
Not in a million years.
It's amazing the way people don't.
They don't believe there are such things.
I sit in the subway sometimes, or in buses, or at the movies...
...and I look at the people near me, and I think:
"What would you say if I told you I was a witch?"
And I know they'd never believe it.
They just wouldn't believe it.
And I giggle and giggle to myself.
You've got to stop giggling here.
I want you to swear you'll stop practicing in this apartment house.
- But you practice here.
- I can be discreet about it. You can't.
I shall move to a hotel.
Very well, but if you get into trouble there, don't look for me to get you out.
I want you to swear you'll never practice witchcraft again, in this house.
If you don't, you'll be sorry.
And you know I can make you sorry, too.
Say, "I swear."
I swear.
Really, Auntie, it's for our own good, dear.
I think you're very cruel.
If you'll wait, I'll change.
There were only a few of us, but I actually saw her do it.
I'm afraid I must agree with you.
Up to a point, Matilda's technically superb, but her brewing lacks quality.
On the other hand, you have to admit that her ointments have done wonders.
Ointments! My dear,
I abandoned ointments when I was 14.
That's understandable. One can't mention
Matilda and you in the same breath.
- There's been nothing this century like you.
- You're sweet.
Gil, darling, you're depressed.
I expect it's Christmas.
It always upsets me.
Auntie, don't you ever wish that you weren't what we are?
No.
That you could just spend Christmas Eve in a little church somewhere...
...listening to carols instead of bongo drums?
Come join Zoe and Waldo and the others.
Why, even Mrs. DePass is here!
I wish I could just spend some time with some everyday people for a change.
You wouldn't like it, darling.
They're ordinary and humdrum.
Yes, I suppose so.
But it might be pleasant to be humdrum, once in a while.
Perhaps you'd like to be humdrum with that Mr. Henderson.
I wouldn't mind.
It has to be around here someplace.
I looked it up in the directory.
All right, Shep. I grant you this place is different, but must it be invisible?
Listen. I swear I hear music.
Don't you hear music?
Well, listen.
What's that? Look.
Drums!
Hello, down there! Hello. Zodiac?
Hello! This is it.
See there? Okay. I'll bet this is it.
There you are, a trail.
Follow the yellow line and keep going...
...and keep going, and there is an arrow.
Success. Come on.
Are you sure you wouldn't rather go back to El Morocco?
Come on, this will be fun.
- Good evening.
- Hello.
Providing the signs are favourable, the Zodiac welcomes you.
- The date of your birth, sir?
- March 12.
Sign of the fish. The time is favourable.
- Sign of the fish.
- Shep, this is the scrabby end!
The night is favourable. Auspicious for love, pleasure and entertainment.
- Go right down.
- Thanks. Come on.
It's not supposed to be known, but he's from the Paris chapter.
This is a number about a man who was assassinated and thrown in a river.
That was ten years ago.
There he's been all this time...
...at the bottom without food, alcohol or a female friend.
In addition, he detests water.
You won't catch her at El Morocco.
She looks like she's been living in a pickle barrel.
I think she's the one.
There's a snapshot of her in his desk drawer.
Auntie, I think...
Yes, I'm sure I do. I know that girl.
- Sure you don't mind?
- Of course not. We're delighted.
That's very kind of you. There we are.
I believe Miss Kittredge and I know each other.
- I don't seem to remember.
- Wellesley, we were in the same dormitory.
Yes, of course.
You were that girl who used to come to class barefoot.
They put you on probation for it, didn't they?
Somebody wrote a note to the dean about it.
I wear them in public now, Mr. Henderson.
- That band certainly is different.
- They play very well together.
Nicky is the one playing the bongos.
Up to a few months ago, he'd never studied music.
Quite remarkable.
Yes, particularly when you consider that he used to work in an herb shop.
Looks to me as if he's eaten one herb too many.
That's why he acts so creepy, I suppose.
No, it's not that at all.
All the Holroyds are a little sinister.
You see, Nicky's my brother.
I'm terribly sorry.
- Waiter.
- Yes, sir?
Give us two more of those.
A vodka and tonic, and scotch and soda.
Yes, sir.
Miss Kittredge had a quirk at college, too.
- Thunderstorms.
- Thunderstorms?
- You do remember them?
- Just an old bugaboo of mine.
That last spring in school, it was most astonishing...
...how many dreadful thunderstorms there were. Remember?
Yes, I remember.
It was most extraordinary.
Why, they lasted for weeks.
- Did they really scare you?
- I'd rather not talk about it.
Are you all right?
Shep, get me out of here!
All the girls loathed her.
She was a liar and a sneak.
And do you know what else, Auntie?
She used to write poison-pen letters.
- That note to the dean was from her.
- Didn't you do anything about it?
Why do you suppose we had all those thunderstorms that spring?
- That was you?
- She was a nervous wreck.
Did you hear that, Nicky?
Why, Nicky! How clever.
It's nothing, really.
Just something I picked up the other day.
Nicky, will you ever grow up?
Auntie, you know something else?
She had a terrible reputation as a beau snatcher.
Now, you can't have a single twitch about taking him away from her.
It wouldn't be anything for you.
Just a few words to Pyewacket.
I don't want him that way.
Gillian, you haven't fallen in love with him and lost your powers?
Of course not.
You don't believe that old wives' tale?
- They say it's true.
- Nonsense! It's the other way around.
We can't fall in love.
I wonder.
I wonder if I could get him without tricks.
I wouldn't know, dear.
I could never do it at all.
If you come in, you can have your presents.
It's been Christmas for hours.
- Now, wait a minute. Let me open it.
- It's my turn now. Let me.
- Auntie...
- If Nicky can, why can't I?
I've your present with me, but it's mingy this year. I've never been so broke.
- I'll like it just the same.
- Let me do it again.
- No, that's enough.
- Come on.
Come on, Queenie. It's present time.
- You know what I used to wonder?
- Pyewacket!
I always used to wonder why all through history...
...witches were always poor when they could get anything.
It's only because they weren't any good at it, anymore than we are.
We can turn out street lights, but we can't make anything turn to gold.
Gil could hex the entire stock market if she wanted. She's afraid of the repercussions.
No, I say you don't know what this kind of thing can do to you, if you go too far.
Records! Wonderful! They're fine.
But I don't have a phonograph anymore.
You'll find you have one when you get home.
Gil, that's too much! Really?
Did you get it for me?
- Did you witch it, or pay for it?
- None of your business.
You mustn't ask that, Nicky.
It's like asking what it cost.
This is lovely, Gillian. What does it do?
It makes you look fascinating.
- You mean...
- No, it has no powers.
I just thought it was pretty.
It is. It's very pretty. I love it.
Thanks again, Nicky.
- What's it for?
- It's for summoning.
You're supposed to take this liquid, and you paint it on an image...
...or a drawing or a photograph of anybody you want, then you set fire to it and...
They got to come to you.
I found it in a new little shop.
Very interesting, Nicky.
I hope it works for you.
I couldn't even make it light.
Let's try it. Right now.
- Who are you going to try it on?
- You'll see.
Nicky, get the bowl.
- The book on the desk, and the scissors.
- The book on the desk, and the scissors.
Who are you going to try it on?
The man who wrote this book,
Sidney Redlitch.
- Where is he now?
- The wrapper says he lives in Acapulco.
- Any words?
- It says not.
- All right. Got a match?
- Here.
Go.
You're a genius.
It's Mr. Henderson!
Hello.
Are you having fireworks?
Sorry to disturb you. I just thought the place was going up in flames.
No, it's nothing like that.
It's just a little game that we play.
It seems rather dangerous, but go right ahead with it.
No, no. It's all right. We've finished.
Nicky, I'm terribly tired.
I must be leaving. Goodnight.
Everything's working out wonderfully.
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas.
Thanks again for the presents, Gillian.
- Good night, Mr. Henderson.
- Merry Christmas.
Well, Merry Christmas.
Perhaps you'd like that rain check now?
All right, only make it a brandy, will you?
- How did you like the Zodiac?
- I'm not quite sure.
Somehow it seemed more like Halloween than Christmas.
Did you know Merle well in school?
Not very.
I'm afraid your brother and those drums were too much for her.
Thank you.
She's really quite a wonderful girl.
Is that your cat?
I've seen him on the stairs, watching me come in and out. What's his name?
- Pyewacket.
- How's that?
- Pyewacket.
- Pyewacket. Well, how do you do?
Bad cat!
- I'm glad he didn't scratch you.
- No. That's all right.
He doesn't have very good manners.
It's just because you're a stranger.
Once he gets to know you...
It's nice having you over me.
I mean, it's assuring having a man near one...
...in case he's needed.
Merle and I are getting married tomorrow.
I mean, today.
We decided the whole thing driving home this evening.
There's this party she's giving tomorrow.
I mean, today, she's giving the party.
And we were going to announce the engagement then.
And then, do it later on...
...but that seems like such a hack's way of getting married, so we're going...
...to drive up-state, or over to Jersey, or wherever it is that you...
...do it, and do it.
It's funny, but all my life I've been either too busy or too careful to get married.
But now, all of a sudden, I just can't wait.
Just can't wait.
Of course,
I imagine it'll be a little strange at first.
It'll sort of be like somebody reading over your shoulder all the time.
I think I'm allergic to your cat.
If it was anybody else but Merle...
...I'd be scared stiff.
For one thing, she has such wonderful taste...
...in clothes, books, everything.
And she paints very well, too.
She paints in this sort of cloudy style.
Did a portrait of me last year.
She was crazy about it.
So I just never did tell her that I thought it was upside down.
I've known her since she was a kid, then she went off to school...
...and I sort of lost track of her.
I've sort of been rattling, haven't I?
It's getting late.
I think maybe I'd better go up.
And thank you for the drink.
Tomorrow's going to be quite an important day for me. I mean, today...
...is going to be quite an important day, so if you'll excuse me.
That tune you're humming, what is that?
Just something I sing to Pye now and then.
Say something.
I want to hear your voice again.
Do you like my voice?
I like everything about you.
Don't you know that by now?
You've made it charmingly apparent.
Just what are you thinking at this moment?
Nothing, nothing at all. And you?
Nothing, either. I can't think.
Certainly not this close to you.
- By the way, where are we?
- On top of the Flatiron Building.
You wanted to be on top of a tall building.
- We had no luck at the Empire State.
- Didn't we knock?
Yes, we did, but they said, not at 6:00 a.m.
They were very understanding, though.
But not as understanding as this fellow downstairs.
- What about before?
- My place.
- Why did we ever leave?
- You wanted to go dancing in the snow.
- Of course, you don't remember.
- I remember every single moment.
And I'm going to muss your nose.
There's a timelessness about this.
I feel spellbound.
Stay that way.
Gillian, tell me now, what has it meant to you?
- Meant?
- These hours.
- They've been enchantment.
- That's all?
Do we have to talk about it? Why?
I'm supposed to be getting married this morning.
Are you?
If not, I'd better ask myself some questions in a hurry.
Do you want to ask them, Shep?
Right at this moment,
I want never to stop seeing you.
I know it doesn't make sense, but...
...I have an idea I must be in love with you.
Has it hit you that way?
I want you as much as you want me.
Would you like it to go on for always?
- Does anything go on for always?
- One likes to think some things do.
Maybe this is one of those things that burn themselves out.
But if it is, it's a whale of a fire.
Shep, it has hit me hard.
Good morning.
Have we done something dreadful?
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.
Merle, I've been taking stock.
I'd make an impossible husband.
Things I've never told you.
I gargle. I eat radishes.
I chew tobacco. I spit.
I'm an insomniac. I don't sleep at all.
I stomp around the bedroom all night long,
talking to myself.
- Besides all that, I snore.
- What?
You won't be happy with me. Not at all.
- Shep, what's the matter with you?
- I don't know exactly.
You look green.
I hope you haven't too much of a hangover from last night.
You're just nervous. You'll be all right.
Bonita called from Westport.
She's found a minister. He'll be ready at 1:00. He arranges for photographers.
- Isn't it exciting?
- It's no good, Merle.
It's just no good. No use.
- Are you still drunk?
- No, I'm not drunk. I'm not drunk.
I may be intoxicated, but not drunk.
- You're certainly not acting like yourself.
- No, I'm not.
You're almost like another person.
That's exactly how I feel, Merle, like another person.
I just don't seem to want to marry you any longer.
You wouldn't want me to marry you when I don't want to, would you?
Are you trying to say you're jilting me?
That's a very heavy word, Merle.
It's a very heavy word.
Let's just say that we're "uncoupling."
- You sound like a lunatic.
- That's very true.
Very true.
I'm sorry, Merle.
I can't really explain this.
I don't fully understand it myself.
What am I supposed to tell people?
Just what do you expect me to do?
You could go back to Arthur O'Neill, the fellow you jilted.
You could take a world cruise.
You could...
...redecorate this apartment.
It really needs it, Merle.
- You are a vile, sleazy, contemptible...
- I'm a cad.
Goodbye, Merle.
I almost forgot my hat.
- Good morning, Tina. Nice Christmas?
- Very nice. And yours?
Superb!
The mail is on your desk.
And Mr. White is in, and the Faulkner galleys are ready.
And that gentleman is waiting to see you.
And Bergdorf's called about that negligee you wanted to send to Miss Kittredge.
Tina, why don't you just have them send that to your house?
And I'm not going to have lunch with Miss Kittredge, or dinner.
You can just cancel all those reservations.
We don't want to have a perfectly good negligee go to waste, do we?
Mr. Henderson, I'm Sidney Redlitch.
You don't know me, but I think I want to see you.
- You're who?
- Redlitch. Magic in Mexico.
Magic in...
Of course. Redlitch, I'm glad to see you.
I'm astonished to see you. Sit down.
I was talking to some people just the other night about you...
...only I understood you were in Mexico.
Yeah, that's right.
You see, there is this new book that I am about to get into.
All of a sudden, I get this...
...uncontrollable urge to talk with you about it.
First, I figured I'd write to you and then I thought maybe I'd phone.
All of a sudden, I decided I had to see you so I grabbed a plane, and here I am.
I didn't expect this kind of weather.
It's chilly here, isn't it?
Are you looking for something?
A little post-Christmas cheer.
Certainly. Tina, get the...
Scotch? Bourbon?
It doesn't make any difference.
- Sit down.
- Thank you.
Listen, Mr. Henderson.
Do you ever publish anything on witchcraft?
- Do you know anything about it?
- Not exactly.
You will. When this new one comes out, this will knock you over.
Water or soda?
Knock them over.
Shep, I thought that we might...
Andy, come in. Meet Sidney Redlitch.
This is my partner, Andy White.
How do you do, sir?
- Mr. Redlitch wrote Magic in Mexico.
- Yes.
And he's just about to do another one.
What are you going to call this one?
Magic in Manhattan or Witchcraft Around Us.
Is it around us?
You bet your boots it is, son, it's all around us.
You probably thought it was confined to the jungles and the tropics. It's not.
- It's right here. New York is full of them.
- Full of what?
- Witches, boy, witches.
- How do you know that?
Sure, go ahead.
- What was that?
- Scotch.
Make this one bourbon, would you?
How do I know? I've met a couple.
Met them through my book, before I went to Mexico.
Take my word for it, right here, all around us...
...there's a whole community of them.
- What do they look like?
- Like anybody else.
Like her.
Like him.
When it's a man, it's called a warlock.
- Did you know they can't cry?
- They can't cry?
Physically impossible for a witch to shed a tear, or blush.
When you throw them in the water, they float.
You mean, you can actually contact these people?
Of course. They have hangouts, but they're open to the public.
Cafés and bars and nightclubs.
They've got a place there in the Village, the Zodiac.
Over in Brooklyn, there's...
You don't take this very seriously, do you?
Yes, I do, but I've got some work to do right now.
Besides, Mr. Henderson's in complete charge of our "abracadabra" department.
See you later.
You said the Zodiac?
The little place in the cellar?
- The headquarters is downstairs.
- The headquarters! I'll be darned!
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.
What are you doing this evening?
I'd like you to have a drink with a couple of friends of mine.
Sure, I'd love to.
...or blush.
If you throw them in the water, they float.
Tell them about the Zodiac, that place where Nicky works.
That's their headquarters.
The place is infested with them.
What do you know?
Just take a good look at the proprietor sometime.
- You mean to tell me he's a witch?
- Absolutely.
- And what is it they call a man witch?
- A warlock.
- Warlock.
- Warlock.
- You'd never know it to look at him.
- You wouldn't, but I would.
- You can recognise them?
- Like a shot.
- How?
- It's a look, or a feeling or something.
I can't put my finger on it, but if one came in here right now...
...I'd know him in a minute.
Yeah. I wonder if we know any of them.
I wonder.
- I suppose there's lots of it around.
- Yeah, it's sort of like the flu.
Make jokes, but my old publisher's still interested.
No, no. As a matter of fact, I've come to a decision. I'll publish your book.
The truth is,
I wouldn't think of not publishing it.
I've seen things from arthritis to the Dead Sea hit the best-seller list.
- Why not this?
- Great! You'll never regret it.
- This calls for a little celebration.
- I think I'll join you.
This is just an amazing coincidence.
Only the other night, Gillian was asking me if I'd like to meet you.
It was right in this room, wasn't it?
Remember?
Toast.
Ring the bell, close the book, quench the candle.
That's how they used to exorcise them, put them out of business.
In medieval times, of course.
Tell me, is it safe to write about all this?
Aren't you afraid of reprisals?
As a matter of fact, I am. There's a woman very high up in the movement.
If I can find her,
I hope to get her on my side.
- Who's that?
- It's a Mrs. De...
- I can't tell you.
- Mrs. DePass?
How do you know that?
I heard someone mention her name at the Zodiac.
They say she smokes cigars made of seaweed.
Sounds like her. Hope I can locate her.
I'm going to start looking tonight.
Hasn't this cat got anything better to do?
- Couldn't you give him something to read?
- I'll put him out.
There's something about that cat.
They make excellent "familiars" though.
Almost all witches have them.
Pets who have to carry out their masters' bidding.
- You did say we were going dancing?
- Yes.
I forgot. I've got something on the stove upstairs. Don't dance all night.
I guess I'd better go, too, so I'll get my coat.
- Turn out the lamps, won't you?
- Surely.
Sorry we have to run, Mr. Redlitch.
I don't like him looking for Mrs. DePass.
Put him off the track.
I see what you mean.
What you said is terribly interesting.
Do you mind if I walk along with you?
That's a wonderful idea.
Maybe we can stop someplace and have a drink.
I know just the spot.
A bar called "Mumbo Jumbo."
- You keep in touch with me.
- Don't worry. I'll touch you for an advance.
That's a little play on words.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Quite a fellow, that Redlitch.
I thought you'd like to meet him.
Don't forget your shoes.
The amazing thing is, I think he believes there are such things as witches.
Just so he doesn't think I'm one.
- We're going dancing, remember?
- Yeah, but first...
Why do we have to go dancing?
I like it here.
- You'll be back.
- You bet I will.
Let's see now, laundry, hotel room...
...money, barber shop.
A good barber, a little trim.
No, not too much.
And a typewriter. I got to get a typewriter.
- I'll loan you mine.
- That's very friendly.
You know something?
There's one thing that you might...
- He's closed.
...need and that would be a collaborator.
I mean it.
Somebody that could really scout around.
You know, get some dope for you.
Let you in on some things.
Let me in?
I am as in as anybody, but one of them himself could be.
And if I got you one of "them" to collaborate with...
That would be different.
- Would you split 50-50?
- Sure. It'd be worth it.
You're naive, boy.
They're very tight with their trade secrets.
I could never get near a deal like that.
You are nearer than you think.
See them?
Watch.
You.
- You get better all the time.
- So do you.
- Your nose is cold.
- I'm cold-blooded.
I wouldn't say that.
That's not fair.
Hello.
What is it?
I know I haven't.
I've been busy. Quite busy.
No, not the way you think. Just busy.
What do you want?
Then say it over to me and I'll correct you.
That's it.
Just a minute.
- The water's boiling, Shep. Will you?
- Sure.
No, not now, I tell you. I'm not alone.
No, no. Nothing's going on.
Just why do you want to know all this?
What do you mean you're working with Redlitch?
I've got to hang up now.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Gil, where's the tea?
The tea, just a minute.
- Where's the tea?
- Right here.
When are we going to get married?
I must have missed a chapter somewhere.
After the last two weeks, you can't say this is so sudden.
No, but I just hadn't thought of marriage.
Darling, that's the man's remark usually.
Gil, I've really got it bad.
I've let everything slide.
I have a pile of unopened manuscripts in my office this high.
I can't stay in my office for wanting to get to you. I'm going crazy.
We can't go on like this.
That's the woman's remark usually.
Why don't you get your shoes?
I'm sure they're dry.
Why are you ducking this?
Tell me, I'm serious.
- I just don't think I'm cut out for marriage.
- Why not?
Because of the way that I've lived...
...selfishly and restlessly, one thing after another.
- You make it sound so...
- I don't mean affairs.
What does it mean, then?
I don't understand.
It's just that my life has been sort of...
...disreputable, at least seen through your eyes.
- I'm cynical, I'm jealous, and I'm vindictive.
- I don't believe that.
It's true.
I've always lived for, and by, the special...
...not the ordinary.
I've never even thought of marriage.
It would mean giving up a whole way of thinking...
...behaving...
...a whole existence.
I don't know if I could.
I wish I could.
Take this and the tea into the other room.
I'll get your shoes.
I wonder if I could.
Suppose he found out afterwards?
Don't look at me like that!
I will if I want to!
Shep, I will!
I'd like to hear that again.
I will.
I want to.
- I'll be different from now on. I promise!
- I don't want you any different.
- I want to be! I want to be quite different.
- I won't stand for it.
Hey, surprise! You're quite a stranger.
Making hay? Boy, we are.
Shep said he'd read the first half tonight.
When did you get mixed up in this?
The night Redlitch and I left your shop, you remember?
You'd die laughing if you read what Redlitch has written.
It's wrong, all wrong.
It took me a while to straighten him out.
What do you mean, straighten him out?
You haven't told him about yourself, have you?
Of course! I told him nearly everything.
I want it to sell, don't I?
He doesn't know about me, does he, Nicky?
No, dear. I told him I was the one who summoned him to New York.
- Of course, if you want the credit, well...
- I do not want to take the credit!
You fool!
Don't you know it doesn't pay to tell outsiders?
I think it'll pay very well this time.
Shep has already given Redlitch a generous advance.
- Nicky, you cannot publish this book.
- What is the matter with you? Why not?
Shep and I are getting married.
For goodness sakes.
Bless your little heart.
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.
Marriage no less.
What fun!
- Shep is really going to have quite a time.
- No jokes, Nicky, and no tricks.
- You don't mean this is on the level?
- Yes, I do!
Why? You've already got him.
What do you want to marry him for?
Because I want to live with him.
Because I'm happy with him.
I suppose next you'll say you're giving it all up.
You're renouncing.
- I have renounced.
- You've what?
- And this is too close to home.
- I'm sorry. This is very important to me.
It is much more important to me, and I want you to stop it!
Not a chance. I'm not going to spend my life being a tom-tom player.
Very well then. I'll just have to do something about it!
You're going to pull one?
I thought you were renouncing!
I'll make a farewell appearance for this.
I wouldn't, Gil.
If you do, I promise your little romance is going to go on the rocks.
Absolute trash. Garbage.
Very frankly, this is the most idiotic thing
I've ever read in my life.
You should call it,
What Every Young Witch Should Know...
...and include a do-it-yourself kit with every sale.
But I thought you were keen on the idea.
Yes, I was, but I've certainly changed my mind.
- Why?
- Why? Because...
- I can go on with a spoof.
- Spoof?
- Silly, isn't it?
- It certainly is silly.
I don't intend to be the laughingstock of the trade by publishing it.
- But every word is gospel, boy, gospel.
- What's the use, Sid? He isn't having any.
This is my hour of grief.
Sidney, maybe we can find something to tide you over.
A little bourbon? Scotch? That's right.
- You don't care which one it is. Nicky?
- No, thanks. I've had plenty.
- Hello, Miss Holroyd.
- Hello.
- Is Mr. Henderson busy?
- Yes, but there's a Mr. Holroyd with him.
Of course, you understand, you can keep the advance.
Well, think of the devil.
I'm sorry, Shep, I have to see you. Now.
Hi, dear. This is a pleasant surprise.
Come on in.
What do you suppose, Gil?
Shep turned down the book.
- I'm afraid I had to.
- You bet you did.
So long, Shep.
You and Gil will be hearing from me.
- You forgot your manuscript.
- Just drop it into the wastebasket.
It was silly of me to try this writing bit anyway, wasn't it, Gil?
You can always go to another publisher.
No, I don't guess any other publisher would do us much good.
- Would it, Gil?
- I doubt it.
I don't suppose you'd be interested in the sequel I have in mind...
...about the islands in the Caribbean,
Voodoo Among the Virgins?
Don't trouble, Nicky.
I'm going to tell Shep.
Either way, it's your funeral, isn't it, dear?
What was that all about?
I decided this morning that there's something I had to tell you...
...even if I thought you'd never find out.
Tell me what?
There are people who...
- Well, I've got to say it, who live by magic.
- By magic?
- You don't believe such thing at all?
- No, dear. No, I don't.
I'm one.
You're one what?
One of the people that the book's about.
And Nicky's one, too.
And he persuaded you to come in on it?
I'm sorry, dear. It just won't work.
I'd be happy to publish the book just for you, but it's just terrible.
You don't understand, Shep.
I'm trying to explain something.
If you're trying to prove to me that Nicky's a witch...
- The word is warlock.
- We don't have to get technical.
Now, dear, listen...
What is wrong?
Has Nicky been threatening you or something?
About telling me something about you or...
That's easy.
- You can tell me yourself.
- That's what I'm trying to do.
What is it? Something in your past?
What have you been up to?
You been engaging in un-American activities or something?
No, I'd say very American.
Early American.
Maybe, I don't know.
Okay, I'll have a look.
- Just give me a minute.
- Shep.
There are people who possess powers that others don't.
Go ahead, dear, I'm listening.
There are ways of altering things, of manipulating things for yourself.
- That's very interesting.
- It's true. I know. I can do it.
You can? Go ahead.
Do something. Show me.
- No.
- Why not?
Because it's habit-forming.
I gave in to it only last night, but I'm going to fight it.
I'm not going to let it destroy me as a person.
- What did you do last night?
- I stopped that book from being published.
No, you didn't. No, that's my province.
I didn't say I stopped you from publishing it.
- I stopped anyone from publishing it.
- Just how did you do that?
You'll say it's absurd.
I put on a spell. I used Pyewacket.
You mean you spoke to the cat about it?
You had him talk the publishers out of it?
Is Pyewacket a witch, too?
All right. Don't believe it.
Don't believe I brought Redlitch to you.
And don't believe...
Just a second.
Let's get our stories straight.
- Nicky says that he brought Redlitch.
- He's lying, because I did.
- With luminous paint, I suppose?
- Yes.
And your telephone.
Who do you think put it out of order?
- Providence.
- No!
- Who?
- Never mind!
Why would anyone want to put my telephone out of order?
As a prank. A trick.
Like turning all the traffic lights on 57th Street green.
That's what Nicky uses it for.
That and his love life.
His love life? That's kind of useful, isn't it?
I don't know what this is all about and I don't know about Nicky's love life...
...but as far as the lights on 57th Street...
...and Redlitch and my telephone, they're coincidences.
Oh, yes. They look like coincidences.
There's always a rational explanation if you want it.
I'll take the rational explanation.
Yes, just as you took the rational explanation of us.
What was that?
There, I've said it.
- You mean that was...
- Yes, that was.
What did happen early Christmas morning?
Was that rational?
Why not?
What happened after Nicky and Queenie left? Exactly.
You asked me to have a drink.
So I sat down and talked about Merle.
And then I suddenly realised
I must be allergic to that cat of yours.
That's right. Go on.
I went over, I picked up my hat and coat...
Then I seemed to see you for the first time.
You left something out. What was I doing?
You weren't doing anything.
You were just sitting there, humming to the cat.
What made you kiss me?
The same thing that makes me want to kiss you right now.
I don't know why you want me to believe you, but I believe you.
I believe you cast a spell on me, an absolutely wonderful spell.
And I believe it and I'm crazy about it.
If you don't believe it, you don't.
I've tried. I tried my best.
I have tried my very best.
It's not possible.
Then, I've never seen her blush.
Does she float?
Stop it!
No, not you. Keep going.
Mr. Henderson,
I'm so thrilled about it all, you and Gillian.
I bumped into Nicky earlier, and he told me everything.
To think that Gil was willing to tell you all about herself.
I do hope you appreciate it, because that's a dangerous thing to do.
It's so lovely that you and Gil are getting married.
Marriage! And to an outsider!
That may be totally unprecedented.
I'm dining with Mrs. DePass tomorrow and I must discuss it with her.
She'll know if it ever happened to one of us before.
But whether it has or not, Shep,
I can call you Shep now, can't I?
- And you must call me Auntie.
- Let me get this straight.
- You mean you think you're one, too?
- Yes, Shep.
How else could I get into your apartment when the door was locked?
Oh, very true.
That door's locked.
Let's watch you open it.
No, I mustn't. I've been forbidden.
- I took the oath.
- You took the oath.
- Gillian made me.
- Sure, she did.
You know, Gil is the gifted one, but she began so much earlier than most.
So did Nicky. I came into it late.
But they were just babies when they started.
Went to children's séances, I suppose.
Baby witch parties.
Yes. We lived in Massachusetts.
I see.
Miss Holroyd, you don't really think that Gil has any powers, do you?
I know she has.
She's done some wonderful things.
My friend.
Those thunderstorms, for instance.
What thunderstorms?
The ones that made your Miss Kittredge so sick at college.
Gil made them happen...
...but she had to do it to settle accounts with her.
Just as she had to do what she did about you.
I must go.
What did she do about me?
- Didn't she mention about the spell?
- Yes, I got that.
Then, otherwise you'd have gone and married Miss Kittredge.
You mean that Gil went after me out of spite against Merle?
No. Not altogether.
She found you very attractive.
- She liked you.
- She liked me?
That's a great deal for us, Shep.
It's not as if we could fall in love.
Love is quite impossible.
Not hot blood, though.
Hot blood is allowed.
But, of course, you know all about that.
Miss Holroyd,
I don't think we'd better go on with this.
I've been too bold, haven't I?
- I hope she likes it.
- I'm sure she will. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- Thanks.
- I gather Queenie's been talking.
- Yes, she has. She certainly has.
It seems you omitted a few high spots this afternoon, didn't you?
You didn't tell me about you and Merle Kittredge at college.
You didn't tell me that you went after me just to spite her, did you?
I didn't, not to spite her.
- But you did. You went after me. Why?
- Because I wanted you.
- Because you were in love with me?
- How could I be? I'd just met you.
Are you in love with me now?
I'm more in love with you than I've ever been with anyone.
That's an evasion.
I tried to tell you how it was with me.
I tried to tell you how it started with us.
I tried to tell you that getting things that way was no good...
...and it was you that made me resolve to be through with it.
I tried to tell you this afternoon, but you...
I did, but you found it so dreadfully funny.
- Don't tell me you're getting angry.
- I am not angry. I'm sorry.
How do you think I feel...
...to find out that you haven't been there the whole time...
...and it's been a merry little adventure?
Don't pretend to cry because you can't do that either!
So now you believe it.
Of course I don't believe it!
Not one single, stupid word of it!
I'm getting out of this building.
And don't think I'm coming back, because I'm not. Ever!
You will. You have to!
You mean the spell?
We'll see about the spell!
Taxi! Taxi!
Fascinating, boy, fascinating.
I hope I can watch.
You're a fool. Who's a fool? You're a fool!
- Hello, Bianca.
- Good evening, Nicholas.
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Mrs. DePass.
I assume this is the one you phoned me about.
- No, I'm all right.
- No. This is Sidney Redlitch, Bianca.
Why, certainly. I'm an admirer of yours.
- This is indeed an honour.
- The honour is mine.
Bianca, this is Mr. Henderson.
He's the one.
How do you do?
Nicholas has explained your condition.
It's too bad. Too bad.
- Can you help me?
- I can but try. Please, step in.
No, no. I'm sorry. It's quite impossible.
- We'll wait in the cab, Shep.
- No, no. Better just carry on.
These matters often take considerable time.
Good luck, Shep.
Goodbye, Shep.
Thank you.
Who's a fool? You're a fool!
Be quiet, Sybil!
Dear Gillian, only an amateur, of course, but very effective now and then.
Do you know what she used?
Used?
Heart of a toad? White vinegar?
Swallow's liver?
- She used a cat.
- Cat?
That's right.
You must wear this.
Put it on.
- Can we get on with it, please?
- Patience.
"I conjure thee to remove all chains and break all bonds which bind thee."
- Drink it.
- Drink it? I will do no such thing!
- Drink it!
- Drink it.
Quickly, while it has strength!
Drink it!
Drink it!
All of it!
You're a fool! Who's a fool? You're a fool!
So cheapening, you taking him to see her!
He's too good for that sort of thing.
Come now, Gil, just because you and Bianca are rivals.
We are not rivals.
That third-rate, vulgar, self-advertising, mail-order sorceress.
You shouldn't have told him, and you know it.
You know what it says on love potions:
"Shake well, but don't tell."
That's what happens to people like us.
We forfeit everything...
...and we end up in a little world of separateness from everyone.
If you don't mind, I'd like to see
Miss Holroyd for a few moments.
- Yeah, Shep, old boy.
- Nicky, will you, please?
Yeah. How are you?
Yeah. You're fine.
I heard about last night, Shep.
- What did you go there for?
- For the hair of the dog that bit me.
That's why.
Listen, I don't want to be here...
...and I wouldn't be, except she said the treatment...
...wouldn't be complete until I confronted you.
Nice of her to make that a condition.
And she told me to tell you that if you have anything further in mind...
...she's fixed it so you can't undo this one.
Yes, and just how did she do that?
She said it was something she put in that disgusting mess she made me drink.
I've never been so humiliated in all my life!
To say nothing of the money it cost me!
- What did she charge?
- What?
- $1,000. At least she took a cheque.
She also said that if we'd gotten married...
...it would've cost a lot more than that to get divorced.
- That's a pretty comparison.
- Yeah, but it's a good one.
Pretty good one, not bad, pretty good.
And now, if you'll forgive me,
I think I'll be going.
Believe me, I've had my fill of this bell, book and candle set.
- It wasn't necessary for you to move, Shep.
- Yes, it was.
I may have trouble subletting.
This isn't the kind of a house...
...that I could wholeheartedly recommend to anybody. Good day.
- You mean goodbye?
- That's right.
- I'll never see you again?
- I can't see what for.
- I suppose you'll go back to Merle.
- Perhaps, if she'll have me.
I forgot, I'm going to a hotel, so I won't be needing this.
Maybe you might, in case you get sick of the primitive art business.
Have broom, will travel.
So...
...a trip to the Brooklyn Harpy, a visit to me, a final moronic joke...
...and away we go! It's that easy, is it?
Go back to Merle Kittredge, will you?
Not if I have anything to say about it.
Perhaps you're defrosted, but I haven't even begun with her!
Let's see, what would be fancy enough?
I'll transport her.
Before I'm through with her, she'll see more geography...
...than Marco Polo!
And you needn't chase after her.
Before she leaves I'll infatuate her.
I'll make her fall for someone, the first stranger that walks in on her...
...the mailman, the plumber, the window washer.
Pyewacket!
Holy smoke!
Pyewacket, where are you?
I know how it sounds.
I'm under a spell. I'm enchanted.
Sure, it's inconceivable, but it's a fact.
I tell you, there are such things and they're right here in New York.
- There are?
- Yes.
That girl you know, Gillian Holroyd, she's one.
A witch?
Shep, you just never learned to spell.
How about those thunderstorms while you were in college?
Think they were ordinary thunderstorms?
Well, they weren't plain, ordinary...
In the last half-hour, have you had an urge to go on a vacation?
To get away from it all?
- No, dear, only from you.
- Only from me. That's a good one.
All I want to do, is to tell you why I'm here.
I have to tell you something peculiar may happen to you.
And if it does, maybe I can help you.
- If this is your idea of a way to crawl back...
- You think what you like.
Just don't blame me if you're eating sukiyaki before the week's out.
Naughty cat! Naughty cat!
Gillian's been looking all over for you!
Why can't you understand that I'm just trying to...
Let me call Dr. Cook.
Maybe he can help you.
A doctor? I'm not crazy, Merle!
I may sound like a lunatic, but I'm not crazy!
I'm not trying to whip up any old passion, so you don't...
It's the exterminator. Can he come in?
- Yes, dear.
- No.
I wouldn't let him come in here if I were you.
- Why not?
- Because he'll seduce you!
- Send him in.
- Yes, ma'am.
- I'm really getting fed up with all this!
- What do you think I feel like?
I'm trying to help you.
Good morning.
You can start in the bedroom.
Yes, ma'am.
Bon voyage.
On the roof, of all places.
He's never gone off like that, has he?
Do you think he was looking for a mate?
Pyewacket, come here!
Pyewacket, get down here this instant!
Come here. Get down. Come on.
What's the matter?
- I have a little job for him to do.
- You mean...
- How thrilling! Who is it going to be?
- Miss Poison Pen, Merle Kittredge.
It's just wonderful, dear, you're staging a comeback.
What are you going to do to her?
Why don't you burn down her house?
Or have all her hair fall out!
Pyewacket! Pyewacket!
Tears.
Real tears.
It's true, that old wives' tale.
It's true! That's why Pyewacket ran away.
You've lost your powers.
I've fallen in love.
I've been coming down with it all along,
I guess.
I didn't know what it was.
What is it like, Gillian, love?
I've never had it, you know.
Is it wonderful?
Wonderful? Oh, no!
Auntie, it's awful.
Auntie, I don't want to be human, not now!
I've said for years, the ideal situation at cockcrow is to be alone...
...with one's subject, on the threshold of a deserted lea.
But where can one find a deserted lea nowadays?
It's impossible.
You can't even find a barber shop that's open at 4:00 a.m.
I haven't had any luck, either.
I'll put that down.
I think our friend Redlitch is kind of gone on Mrs. DePass.
Haven't you heard?
He's writing her life story.
I'm so worried about Gil.
She's been so unhappy these last couple of months.
She asked for it.
You mustn't talk like that. She's so alone.
Even Pyewacket left her, and I can't get him to go back to her.
No wonder. He's a cool cat.
I keep thinking if only something could be done about getting her and Shep together.
Nature might take its course.
- All right. Why don't you fix it?
- My hands are tied.
She's even forbidden me to tell Shep about her predicament.
- Would you handle it?
- Me? No, I'm sorry. I don't believe in it.
If I've told you once,
I've told you 1,000 times.
It never pays to get mixed up with human beings.
The best thing for Gil would be to come back to us, where she belongs.
You don't really understand. She's in love.
Wouldn't she rather be dead?
I simply have to do something.
I simply have to.
- Tina, I'm trying to work.
- Sorry, Mr. Henderson.
For pete's sake!
I bet I've told you 1,000 times about that window.
- I'll close it, Mr. Henderson.
- No, leave it alone!
Got to have some air in this God-forsaken office.
Finish it?
How am I supposed to finish it when I'm getting interrupted?
Let's get some lights in here.
- Can't you do all that later?
- You wanted these arranged right away.
I know what I want! Just leave me alone!
I'm working!
No, you're not! You're howling!
You've been howling for weeks and weeks!
And if you want to fire me, go ahead!
Who wants to work for a coyote?
Coyote.
- Can I help you?
- Yes, you can take your cat back.
I should think this little game of yours is about worn thin.
What on earth are you doing with Pyewacket?
- Somebody gave him my address.
- Well, I didn't!
- He's your cat, isn't he?
- No, he's not my cat.
I don't care whether you put him outside my window...
...or had him fly there. It doesn't matter.
I thought I made myself clear on that.
- What do you mean, he's not your cat?
- He doesn't belong to me anymore.
Why not?
He broke too many shells.
- Where's he going?
- Queenie's. He's hers now.
Queenie's?
Yes. Queenie.
I'm sorry, Shep. I'll speak to her.
I promise nothing else will happen.
I didn't mean to get sore.
That's all right.
- When did all this take place?
- Recently.
- It's quite a change, isn't it?
- Yes.
You seem changed, too.
Do I?
Please, you don't have to stay and be polite.
- Is this one of the rare ones?
- No. It's a Triton's Trumpet.
From the Philippines.
Are you doing well?
Yes, very. How are things with you?
- Fine.
- Good. How's Merle?
She's fine. Fine, I guess.
I haven't seen much of her lately.
I must say it was decent of you not to hex her after all.
- Did you think better of it?
- Yes.
It's extraordinary the way we can discuss things like this.
- Because...
- I know, we're strangers to each other.
No, not quite that.
I wish you wouldn't stare at me so.
- Gil, you're not blushing?
- Of course not.
I want you to have this.
It's a small return for what I cost you.
So little, compared to what you gave me.
- I never gave you much of anything.
- Yes, you did.
You gave me something wonderful!
You made me unhappy.
- You're crying, too!
- All right, I'm crying!
- Why didn't you come and tell me?
- I don't know. Pride, I guess, or shame.
- How did it happen?
- It just happened. It does, sometimes.
No, it only happens one way.
The story is, it only happens if you fall in love.
And it's been happening to me, too.
Ever since I walked in here.
Only it's real this time.
Or has it been real all along?
Who's to say what magic is?
- Gil, don't you want to stop crying now?
- I don't think I can.
I'm only human.
Woman: This is Forbes field in Pittsburgh, and this is our national pastime-- the game of baseball, as played by the Pittsburgh pirates.
[Laughter]
I didn't know a thing about baseball.
My usual job was writing the household hints column on the ladies' page, but the paper was running a series of articles-- what's wrong with the pirates?
The sports editor wanted the woman's angle.
All I knew was that
Pittsburgh was losing.
This, I learned, was quite normal.
He's out!
The manager of the pirates was a large man named Guffy Mcgovern who was always coming out to discuss things with the umpire.
I was too far away to hear, but he seemed upset, irritated, maybe even angry.
What's the matter with you?
[Cursing unintelligibly]
You hear me?
All right, Guffy, watch your language, or I'll throw you out of the game.
There was certainly something wrong with the pirates.
Take that time when Cincinnati was batting and that pirate player got hit in the head with the ball.
That didn't seem right.
[Cursing unintelligibly]
And later in the game, when the pirates were hitting and had a good chance to score, well, even I knew three runners on one base was too many.
You're out!
You're out!
Great!
That's the first time you three guys have been together all season.
[Laughter]
The score at the end of the game was Cincinnati, 21,
Pittsburgh, 2.
You through, Jenny?
I haven't even started.
How do you get a story out of that?
Well, you hit them on a bad day.
Yeah.
Yeah. They had a good one back in 1938.
Hey, maybe I should talk to Mcgovern, huh?
Now?
Well, yeah.
That's a wonderful idea.
Everybody should talk to Mcgovern at least once.
Well, how do I get down there?
Well, you see that second tunnel down there?
Yeah.
Go down through that.
The first door on the right is the entrance to the pirate clubhouse.
Oh, thanks, and thanks for letting me sit here.
Anytime.
And, Jen, give Guffy our best regards.
I will. Bye.
Bye.
What a dirty trick.
So ends another holocaust in Forbes field, the pirates' exhibition of skill this afternoon reducing their standing to seventh place in the national league.
By the way, I'll not be with you for the balance of the season.
It seems in the course of my sportscasts,
I have somehow offended the great Guffy Mcgovern, alleged manager of the pirates.
Steps have been taken, and briefly, your announcer has been canned.
I'll still have my regular
Tuesday night broadcast and Wednesday television, and I shall continue to call the plays as I see them.
This is Fred Bayles saying thank you, Guffy Mcgovern.
No, no, lady. You can't go in there.
Press.
No.
Gangway.
Uh, Mr. Mcgovern, please.
Does he come out this way?
When he's dressed, he does.
I'd like a story, so I think I'll wait.
Lady, he just lost a ball game 21-2.
He's unhappy.
You can't win all the time.
Guffy Mcgovern:
I would like to say a few words about today's endeavor with the Cincinnatis.
Of all the...
[Cursing unintelligibly]
Personally, I think it was a waste of time to send me.
I don't know the game, and I haven't any story, but I can tell you what's wrong with the pirates, all right-- that Mcgovern person.
Of all the loudmouthed, offensive-- and all those nice, clean-cut young men and the way he bullies them.
No wonder they make mistakes. Anybody would.
But if you ask me, the Pittsburgh pirates would be a lot better off without him, and so would the city of Pittsburgh!
Hey, write it.
Write what?
What you think about Mcgovern.
But he'd sue us.
Honey, compared to his real character, it'll read like a testimonial.
Do your worst, and let me see it when you're finished.
Well...
Hi, Jen.
Hi.
Household hints.
Obituary department.
12 more people kicked off today.
How was the game?
Anybody die out there?
Just the pirates.
Listen to this--
"Ignatius A. Turnball, aged 77 years, passed away at his home today following a..."
What a depressing job.
Think about me.
I have to write about
Guffy Mcgovern.
Now, there's an obituary
I'd like to handle.
Mr. Kirney must have liked the story.
He even put my byline on it--
"by Jennifer Paige, household hints editor."
He wanted more of the same-- personal stuff about Mcgovern.
I realized I'd have to do a little sleuthing.
I found out where he lived-- one furnished room and kitchenette near the ballpark.
He had no known relatives, never any visitors.
Every morning about 11:00, he left for the field.
There were plenty of empty cabs cruising around, but Mcgovern wanted the one without the driver.
He would.
[Honking horn]
Hail a cab!
Hail a cab!
This is the only hack in Pittsburgh?
You like the color or something?
You know the law, Sonny.
You're supposed to stay with your cab at all times.
Are you with it?
Forbes field and make it snappy.
Aw, the bums don't start until 1:30!
His afternoons were spent like this...
[Cursing unintelligibly]
The only place he was seen in public outside the ballpark was John's steakhouse.
They had the best steaks in town.
Medium rare.
Yeah.
I'm going over and talk to him.
You'll make a nice item tomorrow.
"Jennifer Paige, age 24, departed this world at approximately--" oh, stop.
I came here to corner him, didn't I?
Well, there he is, cornered.
Waiter, a Brandy for the lady.
Yes, sir.
I'm Jennifer Paige.
Jennifer Paige.
I wrote that story about you this morning in the messenger.
You didn't read it?
All I ever read is the box scores.
Well, I began this way...Quote--
"Aloysius X. Mcgovern,
"the evil-tongued orator of the baseball field
"is a surly, unbred goat
"whose mouth should be washed out regularly with a strong detergent."
Don't ever call me Aloysius.
You're--you're not mad?
Dogs have fleas.
Managers have sportswriters.
Oh, I'm not a sportswriter.
I do household hints for the ladies' page.
But I have a few facts and figures about your-- oh, don't put so much ketchup on your steak.
It spoils the flavor-- a few statistics that might be interesting.
For instance...
Last season, Minelli had a batting average of .310.
This year he had .210.
Now, that's 100 points difference.
Doesn't that prove something?
I'll have to speak to Minelli.
Cruickshank's average is way down, too--93 points, and Minden's and begg's, and it's the same right through the whole batting list.
Where'd you gather this information?
Tim Durney helped me.
He's the obituary editor.
What do you hear from want ads?
Well, I realize figures can be misleading, but when an entire team goes as sour as the pirates, well, I look around for a reason, and I look right at you.
Uh, what, uh, what-- what do you have to say,
Mr. Mcgovern?
What'd he say?
"Boo"?
Well, well, Guffy Mcgovern.
How are things in seventh place?
Fine. Fine.
What do you do with your afternoons now, junior?
Thanks to you,
I just signed a deal to broadcast for the giants, whom, as you may have heard, are leading the league.
Meanwhile, I'm just lying around thinking of things to say about you.
Why don't you catch me tonight?
I'm on the air in an hour.
I can't wait.
I got a mission in life now, Guffy.
I'm going to run you out of this town, maybe right out of organized baseball.
You wouldn't do that.
Oh, yes, I would.
I'm a stinker.
Why don't we talk this over?
Let's step in here a minute.
I got an exclusive for you.
[Thumping]
[Punch]
[Thud]
* take me out to the ball game *
* take me out to the... ** before I say good night,
I would like to reiterate...
My opinions are those of an unbiased observer who has the best interests of baseball at heart.
There is nothing personal in my feud with Guffy Mcgovern.
Incidentally, don't look for me on television tomorrow.
[Crowd cheering]
By asking questions,
I began to learn baseball.
Question-- what is a balk?
Answer-- see me tomorrow.
Question-- what is a rhubarb?
Answer...
[Shouting]
He's out.
The man was out!
The man was out!
Get out, Mcgovern!
You're out of the game!
[Clapping in time to Mcgovern's footsteps]
[Clapping stops]
Boo!
Boo!
[Clapping in time to footsteps]
Radio:
And there you have it.
Final score--Cincinnati, 9,
Pittsburgh, 0.
The pirates had a total of 3 hits, 7 errors.
The reds, 14 hits-- don't be so modest, Baxter.
You made two of those errors all by yourself.
Well, what's the matter, Mr. Minden?
Did you think that was second base?
Ah, I'm certainly proud of you athletes today.
Particularly you,
Mr. Ronson, our schoolboy star, the pride of Milwaukee high.
But I worry about you, son.
You're going to catch a fly ball some of these days and knock out your front teeth.
Ah, Cruicksie.
Cruicksie, you were fine.
You didn't fall down once.
And here we have the famous Saul Hellman, our relief pitcher.
You fellas may not believe this, but Saul once pitched a two-hitter in a world series.
Of course, that was quite some time ago, but he's still in there pitching.
1 walk and 4 hits on 10 pitched balls.
Don't you think you're a little old for this pastime, Saul?
You should have quit winners when you could still reach the plate.
Easy, Saul.
I'm glad for one thing-- today's game puts us in eighth place.
We can go no lower in this league.
We used to have a guy like that in the 3-i league once.
We used to put gunpowder in his cigarettes.
Hey, has Mcgovern always been like this?
You knew him in the minors, didn't you, way back when?
Well, what I mean is, you know, when you were first breaking in.
You can say it--
16 years ago.
Oh, you've got plenty of stuff left. Plenty.
Sure.
Where's my good luck piece?
I put it in your uniform.
Well, where is it?
Maybe you dropped it out on the field.
Of all the...
[Cursing unintelligibly]
Oh, shut up!
What?
Close your fat mouth.
I want to talk to you.
If that's some wise guy on the P.A. system,
I'll bust his snoot.
You'll bust nobody's snoot if you know what's good for you.
You've been busting snoots and polluting the air with your foul talk long enough, Mcgovern.
Frankly, we're fed up.
Do tell.
And who are you, may I ask?
An angel.
How's that?
I'm an angel.
Well, you must be very proud.
Let me get my hands on him.
I'll make him an angel.
Oh, you're cold, Mcgovern.
I never sit in the field boxes.
Where do you sit?
Usually on the right hand of the archangel Gabriel.
That name mean anything to you?
Sure, sure. Gabriel.
Trumpet player.
None of your lip, Guffy, or I'll boot you over the center field wall.
I can get just as tough as you. Remember that.
I'll murder this guy!
Cold, Guffy.
Oh, colder still.
Now you're getting warm.
Keep talking.
The angel Gabriel's taken a personal interest in you, bigmouth.
It seems someone down there's been sending up a lot of prayers on your behalf.
Somebody praying for me. Gee.
One punch!
That's all I ask! One punch!
Before he answers those prayers, he'd like to clean you up a little, and I'm stuck with the job.
Now, there's certain rules.
I'll give them to you fast.
Number 1-- cut out the blasphemy.
Number 2--start treating your fellow men with a little more respect and understanding.
Quit making life miserable for everybody around you.
Number 3-- and this is important-- love and stop slugging thy neighbor.
You hear me?
I hear you fine.
Why can't I see you for one moment?
Because I usually stay as far away from you as possible.
The bleachers!
Stay where you are!
Stand still and listen, or I'll blast you with a bolt of lightning.
Now don't rile me, boy.
Just behave yourself, and we'll get along fine.
As a matter of fact,
I'll make a deal with you-- lay off swearing and fighting, and I'll win you some ball games.
I might even win you a pennant.
You'd like to win a pennant again, wouldn't you, Mcgovern?
All right, you play ball with me, and I'll play ball with you.
How about that?
How do I know you're what you say you are?
Thunder and lightning's not enough, huh?
All right, Aloysius, you trusting soul, look for a miracle tomorrow night in the third inning.
What kind of a miracle?
Tomorrow night in the third inning...
Hey! Hey!
Hey, where are you?
Wait a minute!
Wait a--
[crowd cheering]
Ronson?
You're out!
You're out!
[Crowd cheering]
[Crowd cheering]
Safe!
[Crowd cheering]
[Crowd cheering]
Out!
Yeah? What?
I was about to suggest that possibly you erred on that decision.
Get off the field.
Yes, sir.
[swat]
Nice going, bigmouth.
[Take me out to the ball game playing]
Jennifer: The pirates had come to life.
On the road, they won 10 games straight, and stranger still,
Mcgovern was a changed man.
He hadn't punched a soul in two weeks.
The team was in sixth position when they played the braves in Boston.
It was the last inning.
The pirates were winning 8-6, a hard-fought game.
Boys, boys!
Now, boys, boys, please take it easy.
Now, I'll handle this.
Let me-- get out of my way, you bowlegged ape.
You fetter-mouthed donkey, you buckethead...
[Thunder]
Well, Mcgovern, you sure talked your way out of that one.
10 straight games, and then you had to go and blow it.
Now, look-- take off your hat.
Yes, sir.
All I said this afternoon--
I heard what you said.
Don't repeat it.
Well, look.
The guy called me an ape.
Bowlegged ape.
Yeah.
You are a little bowlegged.
What am I supposed to do-- take it as a compliment?
Don't I get a chance to talk back?
Certainly.
The English language has a total of 698,000 words.
We ask you to avoid
1/100 of 1% of these, which, at the moment, seems to be your entire vocabulary.
I'll be tongue-tied.
Shakespeare wasn't, nor Milton, nor Robert burns.
Study, Mcgovern, study.
Ok, I keep my trap shut,
I win all my games, huh?
Now, wouldn't that look a little silly, the pirates winning every game?
Yes, it would.
Besides, we have other things to do.
A lot of time, you'll be on your own, and when you need us, we'll be in there pitching.
Who's we?
Me and my boys-- the heavenly choir nine.
Ball players?
Sure.
In heaven?
Oh, there's plenty of ball players in heaven.
What do you know?
But very few managers.
Oh. How do your, uh, boys help?
Oh, they sort of get behind your boys, throw out a few quick hunches.
Who's on your squad, the heavenly choirs?
We won't go into that, but I don't mind telling you that we have a team batting average of .331.
Good club.
Not bad.
When your boys played baseball down here, did I know any of them?
Did I know you?
We might have run into each other.
On what base?
Ha ha ha ha.
Come on. A guy's got a right to know his own angel.
Just give me a hint.
What team were you with?
What position?
All right, lay off, Mcgovern.
Your broken-down ball club is winning ball games.
What more do you want?
I'll see you around, huh?
Now, wait. Listen-- good-bye. Keep your nose out of things that don't concern you.
All right, all right.
Don't go away sore, huh?
Sorry, Mr. Mcgovern.
Oh, that's all right.
Sit down, son.
Well, I told Minelli I'd have dinner with him.
Hey, when you made that catch today, how come you were laying so far to your right?
I don't know.
I had sort of a feeling
Johnson would hit it there.
A left-hander?
He never hit there in his life.
I don't know. Just call it a hunch.
He's reading Shakespeare.
Go on!
The tempest. I had it in English three.
He asked me to sit down with him.
Yeah. This morning he said hello.
I don't like it, boys.
It isn't natural.
He hasn't changed.
He's just charging his batteries.
Waiter.
Yes, sir?
Did you do what I said?
Yes, sir.
This all right?
You're sure it's tough enough?
Mr. Baxter, this was cut right from between the horns.
Here, sir.
Hey, Saul.
Yeah.
Pull up a chair.
Thanks, but I'd like to digest my dinner.
You did all right in the old days.
Remember how we used to tear around?
I don't want to think about the old days.
I don't want to think about you.
Do you mind?
Your steak all right, sir?
It's a wee bit tough, but it has a very nice flavor.
When the pirates played their next game in Pittsburgh, it started out just like any other afternoon.
But events were taking shape in the bleacher section.
Some orphan kids, in on passes, had come to cheer for the home team.
It was a regular weekly event.
Who's pitching,
Mr. Smalley?
Martin, sister.
Won 4, lost 6.
[Snap]
Come on, Martin.
Stay in there and keep it high.
If he feeds it to Modbury low, he'll put it right in our laps.
Oh, dear.
Don't worry about
Martin. He's super.
Let's go, Marty!
Show 'em what you did in Boston!
Pass the peanuts, dear.
Fair!
Hey, ump!
Fair?
Fair ball?
Why, thou knave, thou dolt, thou hast eyes but seest not.
You heard him.
He said fair.
Fie! Fie upon you and a pox upon you, too!
Thou art blind, thou black-livered bat!
Hey, Hamlet, blow.
All right, let's get it.
Come on.
Atta-boy, Joe.
Jennifer: The orphan kids cheered for the pirates all through the game, but they were losing.
It was the sixth inning, the score, 7-2 in favor of the Phillies.
Things were looking bad for the pirates.
Then suddenly it happened.
Look! Look at the angel behind Mandekic.
What did you say, dear?
And there's one behind Ronson, too, and Rothberg and Rezende.
There's one in back of everybody.
One what?
Angel.
Get her out of the sun.
Come along, Bridget.
Come along.
How do you feel, dear?
I feel fine.
[Crowd cheering]
There they are again!
Bridget, there are people sitting behind you.
But I see them--angels.
The kid is seeing angels.
Ain't nothing to what I've seen sometimes.
Look!
Shh! You'll get us in trouble.
Bridget, that's enough.
But I see 'em, sister, big as life-- in the outfield, in the infield...
And there's one sitting on the scoreboard.
Are you having trouble, sister?
Nothing I can't take care of, thank you.
Do you want to leave again and not come back?
No, sister.
Then let's have no more angels.
Jennifer: The pirates won again, 10-7.
It was getting to be a habit.
On the way out,
I ran into Smalley, the park cop.
He told me about the little girl in the bleachers, an orphan who saw angels.
I had my story for the day.
* take me out to the ball game *
* take me out to the fray *
* la da da da da da * hello, Joe.
Good morning.
* la da da da Dee Dee Dee *
* buy me some peanuts and crackerjack-- ** yes?
Uh, I'd like to see a little girl.
Come in, please.
What age?
Oh, uh, about 8, I guess.
That would be third grade--my class.
Would you wait just a moment, please?
Sure.
[Clack clack]
Children, there's a gentleman here.
He's looking for a little girl.
They never adopt them with glasses.
[Clack clack clack clack]
Why, Mr. Mcgovern.
I think she's the one.
I--
I'd like to talk to you.
I think you should talk to some of the others, too.
We have some very nice girls here.
I'm sure.
What is it, sister?
Mr. Mcgovern.
How do you do? I...
I came about the story in the paper.
Yes. I read it.
Is this the kid that-- is she the little girl who saw the angels?
I just want to ask her a couple of questions.
Bridget, wait in my office.
Yes, sister.
Thank you, sister.
Mr. Mcgovern, will you come with me, please?
Thank you.
I'm sister Edwitha, mother superior.
How the paper got the story
I have no idea, but I think it's best for all concerned that we just forget it.
Yes. Oh, sister...
Excuse me, but you don't know baseball, baseball fans.
Thing like this gets started, it becomes a big megillah.
Oh, a megillah's a sort of a-- federal case.
Yeah.
Go on.
Well, the fans want answers.
I'm the manager, and I got to supply them.
A little girl sits too long in the sun without her hat on, and she thinks she sees something.
Surely you don't believe they were angels.
Oh, me?
Would it do any harm just to talk to her?
I don't want the child excited.
I won't. I promise.
Well, just one moment.
Oh, there's one other thing.
Yes?
In the seventh inning yesterday afternoon, when Rothberg was on third, why didn't you try a squeeze?
They were expecting it.
Well, that's just it-- they were expecting it, and they knew that you knew that they were expecting it, so you wouldn't pull it.
Why, it would be completely unexpected.
Rothberg's fast.
He'd have made home easily.
Yeah. Well,
Rothberg happens to have a bad ankle.
He hurt it in practice.
Oh, I'll light a candle for him.
[Doorbell buzzes]
Will you just go along in and excuse me?
Hiya.
Hi.
Sit down.
You, uh...
Um...
You read this?
It says yesterday you saw angels.
Did you?
Are you sure?
Did you ever see angels before?
Well, how'd you know they were angels?
They looked like angels.
With wings?
Well, sort of like wings.
Not baseball uniforms?
Sort of like uniforms.
What color socks?
I couldn't see.
Their robes were too long.
How many were there?
One behind each player-- the pirates, I mean-- one on the scoreboard and one in the bullpen.
Was there one behind me?
Uh-huh.
Is he there now?
Who's that?
That's Saint Gabriel.
Figures.
Now, about these, uh,
"sort of like uniforms."
Was there any writing across the chest, like New York, maybe, or, uh, cardinals or Dodgers?
It wasn't a whole name, just initials.
Well, what initials?
H.C.
[Gasps]
Heavenly choir.
What?
Uh, nothing, nothing. Uh...
Uh...
Now, uh...
About these other kids.
They didn't see anything, huh?
Just you?
Why was that, do you suppose?
Maybe because I've been praying for you.
Me? You've been praying for me?
The whole team.
How long have you been praying?
Ever since you hit the slump.
You must have been praying pretty hard, huh?
Oh, yes, every night and every morning, and...And sometimes during arithmetic.
That's very nice.
Thanks.
Well, you needed help, didn't you?
We sure did.
I prayed to
Saint Gabriel personally.
He's our patron Saint.
Good man, Gabriel.
What's your name?
Bridget white, 8 years old.
How long have you been here?
Eight years.
Oh. I, uh,
I have to shove off now, Bridget.
It's been nice talking to you.
So long.
So long.
Oh, Bridget, about those prayers.
Keep 'em coming, huh?
He's nice, isn't he?
No, no, no, you can't see her. I'm sorry.
Now, please go away.
We won't hurt the kid, sister.
The whole story is ridiculous.
"No angels, says sister Edwitha."
Can we quote that?
Don't you dare.
Sister.
Don't you print that picture, young man.
Evening post, sister.
It's a beauty.
Well, hiya, Guffy.
How's the angels?
Look, let me out of here, will ya?
How about a statement, Guffy?
No comment.
No comment.
Maybe he believes in them, too.
How about it?
Yeah. What are you doing here, Guffy?
Where's your harp?
Lay off me, will you?
You want to know about angels, ask her.
She wrote the story.
I'm getting out of here.
[Thunder]
Now what did I do?
Oh, nothing personal, eh?
[Doorbell buzzes]
Well, miss household hints.
What can I do for you?
You can listen while I say I'm sorry.
Honestly, I had no idea that story would raise such a fuss.
If I had,
I never would have-- what a mess this place is--
I never would have written it.
Your mistake was in showing up at that orphanage.
The newspapers are going to make a monkey out of you.
Goat, monkey--
I'm used to it.
If I were you,
I'd protect myself, Mcgovern.
Make a statement.
To you?
Why not?
Miss Paige, you're ruining my carpet.
Oh, don't be afraid of mud stains.
They're very easy to take out.
Here, do you mind?
Stuff them with newspaper, turn on the oven, and put them underneath.
What kind of a parrot is this?
It's a parrot.
Does it talk?
Yes.
Did you teach it?
Yes.
Scratch my head, please.
Well...
He's very polite, isn't he?
Why shouldn't he be?
What else does he say?
He says, "hello, how've you been?"
And "good-bye."
Joe, say good-bye to the lady.
Good-bye.
That's wonderful.
But doesn't he ever...
Well, with you teaching him, doesn't he-- a man only swears when he's annoyed.
Joe never annoys me.
We're very happy together, Joe and I.
Well, frankly, I don't see how you can be in a shambles like this.
How do you ever find anything?
Look, there isn't even a place for a guest to sit down.
There might be an idea in that.
Well, you can't get rid of me just yet, so you might as well make the best of it.
You know,
I've always wondered what baseball players did on rainy afternoons.
Entertain lady reporters who drop in uninvited.
Well, you're not being very entertaining.
What about the story of your life, Mcgovern, while my shoes are drying?
Were you always so tough?
Even when you were little?
You had a boyhood, of course.
Tilton falls, Wisconsin.
I looked you up.
Sounds like a nice little town.
It was--four pool halls, five saloons, and the biggest pants factory in the state.
Did you play ball there?
I sold peanuts.
Your folks weren't very well-off, huh?
My folks did fine. They had one of the saloons.
One day, they gave you a ball and a bat, and that's how you got started.
Not exactly. I used to throw snowballs at the cop on the corner.
It was a long block and a long winter, so I finished up a third baseman.
Any more "down memory Lane" stuff you'd like?
No.
[Sniff sniff]
Are you cooking something?
My shoes!
Yeah, they're kind of crisp.
I said under the oven, not in it.
Of all the stupid, asinine-- shh! Not in front of Joe.
Oh. How do you suggest I get home?
Well, I could loan you a pair of my shoes, or I'll call a cab.
Where do you live?
Delaney street.
And how do I get to the cab?
I weigh 110 pounds.
When the cleaning woman comes in, tell her to burn all the old papers and put an airwick in the corner to get rid of that cigar smell--
I like cigar smoke.
And scour the ashtrays with ammonia.
Oh, and if she wants to take the ink stains out of that burgundy chair-- what chair?
Burgundy, that's a color-- she can call me at the office-- extension 1173.
Will you open the door?
You know, I could be a big help to you.
Just what I always needed-- a girl with turned-up shoes. 110?
Yeah.
Here, take these to Delaney street.
So if I took her to the ball game and we sat in the grandstand out of the sun, she wouldn't see any angels, of course,
I'd write the story just that way, and that would be the end of it.
All right.
Bridget!
Bridget!
Ooh! This is Bridget white, miss Paige.
Hello.
Would you like to go to the ball game with her this afternoon?
Can I?
Mm-hmm.
Will we speak to Mr. Mcgovern?
Well, uh, we can wave.
All right, run along.
Comb your hair, put on a hat...
With a brim!
Jennifer: Bridget and I got pretty chummy during the game, exchanging girlish confidences.
The boys in the press box kept showing up with a steady stream of hot dogs and Eskimo pies and asking Bridget if she saw any angels.
Uh, vanilla ok?
Oh, thank you.
Mac, I think that's enough.
How's it going, honey?
The, uh, angels working yet?
Uh-uh.
Well, you'll let us know, won't you?
Oh, uh, Jenny, how about dinner after the game?
Oh, thanks, but I'm testing a new recipe tonight.
Well, have fun.
Bye.
Do you live alone?
All by myself.
That must be nice.
Why?
I mean, instead of having a lot of kids around all the time.
Kids are such a bother, aren't they?
Mmm...It depends.
I always say, why not live alone if you can live alone?
Take like if you had someone around the house all the time.
You couldn't even come to the ball game when you wanted.
Not unless I brought her with me.
What's the matter?
They're warming up.
Who?
The angels.
Oh, now, Bridget, no!
There they come, out on the field.
There's no one, nothing.
Look!
Don't you see?
You couldn't possibly see anything down there.
Do you hear me, Bridget?
But I do. There's one behind every player.
Oh, no! Come on, get out of here quick!
Hey, they're going!
Hey, Jenny! Jenny, wait a minute!
Honey! Jenny, Jenny, what's the story?
Look, fellas. We're leaving, that's all.
Did you see any angels?
How many were there, Bridget?
Nine!
Nine?
Nine?
Reynolds here.
Take this--
"the angels were out in force today, said little
Bridget white."
Wait in here, please.
All right.
Thank you.
I hear the kid's sick.
What did you do to her?
Nothing. I think it was just the ice cream and the four frankfurters.
Nice food for a kid.
You ought to know better.
Why did you want to drag her out there in the first place?
I didn't drag her.
She was dying to go.
I only wanted to help.
Help? Fine help.
"Mcgovern's angels strike again."
What are you trying to do-- laugh me out of baseball?
Mr. Mcgovern,
I haven't laughed since the day I met you.
Were they boy angels or girl angels?
Boy angels.
Did they look like people or did they look like the pictures of angels on our little prayer cards?
Prayer cards.
Sore, huh?
What color robe did they wear?
White, eh?
You're sure they were angels?
They weren't groundkeepers?
Or they were peanut vendors?
Angels.
[Door opens]
Sister, Mr. Mcgovern and miss Paige, they'd like to see Bridget.
Oh, please, can they?
I don't see why not.
Organically, she's fine.
Just a little upset stomach is all.
But, uh, emotionally,
I'm not so sure.
You really think that we should-- he can do no harm.
He's an excellent man.
Bridget, I don't want to alarm you, but we're going to call another doctor.
He won't give you any medicine.
He'll just ask you a few questions.
You understand, don't you?
Sure. You want to find out if I'm wacky.
Doctor, I'm sure it's not necessary.
Only a few minutes, please.
Now, don't you go upsetting her.
How you feeling?
Much better, thank you.
You just ate too much junk, huh?
It was the nicest time
I ever had.
I brought you a present.
Oh, thank you.
You shouldn't have.
Aw, it's nothing.
It's beautiful!
Yeah. Well, it jumps, too, if you just squeeze this little thing here at the end, see?
[Squeaking]
It talks, too.
Imagine.
Well, it's just a kid's kangaroo.
I'll take it back and get you a real toy.
No. Please.
I love it.
But will you come to see me again anyway?
Yeah. Sure. Every day as long as you're sick.
Miss Paige, too?
Me, too.
Now, I think you'd better get some sleep.
Yeah. Good night,
Bridget.
Every day while I'm sick?
Of course.
Sure.
Good night.
Jenny: The story became a national issue.
Everyone was talking about angels.
There were newsreel interviews with baseball celebrities.
Bayles: Joe DiMaggio,
Yankees center fielder.
What do you think, Joe?
If Mcgovern needs any extra angels, we'd be glad to give him a couple of ours.
Ty Cobb, one of baseball's all-time greats.
What do you think,
Mr. Cobb?
Well, all I can say is that this game of baseball has certainly changed.
Bayles: Songwriter
Harry Ruby, composer of three little words,
America's number-one baseball fan.
I predicted this at the start of the season when I said,
"heaven help the pirates."
Bayles: Bing Crosby, part owner of the Pittsburgh pirates.
You know, I think this angel stuff's pretty sound.
Lots of times folks think someone's watching over them.
Thanks.
Jenny: Whenever the team was in town,
Mcgovern paid a visit to the orphanage, and he made good his promise to bring a new present.
Now if you just go back to your seats so everybody can see...
Just turn this knob, see?
Now watch.
Announcer: He's got that chin lock again.
Yanking his head back.
The monster is trying to put on a leg crusher.
Very educational.
Yeah.
When the pirates climbed into third place, the newspapers laid off Mcgovern.
The angels were completely forgotten.
Tell him to bunt.
Wait.
Let him hit away.
Stay in there, Lou.
Safe!
That was a nice switch.
Just a hunch.
[Whistling]
* happy birthday to you *
* happy birthday to you ** happy birthday, Mcgovern.
What goes on?
A party!
But how did you know?
Bridget, she looked it up in the sporting news.
Parrot:
Hello.
Hiya, Joe.
I didn't throw out a single thing you'll ever miss.
Don't you like it?
Sure.
Sure, I like it.
Hey, a cake and everything.
Jennifer made it.
I turned on the oven.
What do you know?
A regular birthday party.
I haven't had one since I was 10.
Believe me, that's a long time ago.
It sure is.
The book said-- never mind.
I tell you what, on your birthday,
I'll give you a party.
When is it?
Well, I'm not sure exactly, but the home picked October 5th.
That's the only day they had open.
Look, you help me in the kitchen, and, Bridget, why don't you give Joe a piece of this celery, huh?
That-a girl.
I hope you don't mind.
She's getting such a kick out of it.
Why should I mind?
Would you hand me the salt, please?
Hey, what smells?
So good, I mean.
Uh, ragout of veal a la brignole.
Oh, fancy stuff, eh?
Mm-hmm. You eat too many steaks, Mcgovern.
Change will be good for you.
Yeah, brignole smells great.
You know, I often wonder who dreams up all these things.
Uh, Mrs. Harkrider Oates of Rawson Avenue.
Is that so?
Her favorite recipe.
Guaranteed to keep men at home.
Now the butter, please.
Well, we won again today, didn't we?
Yeah, we did.
I suppose you realize we're only five games out of first place.
I've heard some talk.
Isn't it wonderful?
Just a few weeks ago, we were last.
Wonder how it happened.
Angels.
Shh! The parsley, please.
The green stuff, the parsley.
Right there.
Thank you.
I have a different theory, you know.
I think it's you.
Me?
Sure. The pirates are playing as a team.
Why don't you take your apron off, honey?
'Cause you're not losing your temper and yelling your head off and swinging on people.
Sister Edwitha says,
"never swing on people.
You should turn the other cheek."
Well, there's two schools of thought on that.
My school recommends getting in the first punch.
Sister Edwitha says,
"turn the other cheek."
You see?
Ok, I suppose she knows best.
Now, you can carry this.
Bridget, you take the peas.
Now, be careful.
They're hot. There.
Look out!
You'll sit on the presents.
Oh!
That one's mine.
I'll save this till last.
Well.
Not too loud, is it?
No, no.
Yellow and green's not loud.
Now...
Well, what do you know?
A baseball.
It's not just an ordinary baseball.
Jennifer sent it into the clubhouse, and all the pirates signed it. See?
All except Mr. Hellman.
He was in the shower.
Imagine, an autographed ball.
That's just what I wanted.
Well, come on, let's try this.
Well, what's the matter?
Well, what about grace?
Grace who?
Oh, grace.
Yeah, grace.
I almost forgot.
You--you lead off.
Oh, lord, make us truly thankful for these, thy gifts, which we are about to receive.
Amen.
You know, I'm hungry.
I hope I fixed enough of everything.
Cooking for myself the way I do,
I'm never exactly sure how much I should-- oh, don't eat that.
No. No, it's...Delicious.
Oh, no, don't! It's poison.
I never in all my life--
Mrs. Harkrider Oates of Rawson Avenue is certainly going to hear from me in the morning.
Keeps men at home, does it?
Maybe she means permanently.
I can't understand it, though.
Unless that olive oil...
Could it have been rancid?
How long have you had it?
What olive oil?
The olive oil in the cupboard, in the bottle in the cupboard.
Neat's foot oil.
What?
Not olive oil, neat's foot oil.
I rub it in my glove.
Keeps the leather soft.
What's it doing in the cupboard?
I got to put it someplace.
It's wonderful for gloves.
It certainly doesn't do anything for veal.
The peas are fine.
You can't make a meal on peas.
Oh, I just feel awful.
I should have looked at the bottle.
I always look at the bottle-- now, wait, now, don't lose your head.
This is my birthday, and I'm not going to have it spoiled by Mrs. Harkrider Oates of Rawson Avenue.
How's that?
All right?
Well, well, well.
This is a cozy little scene.
Birthday party?
Yeah, yeah.
Keep moving, huh?
I don't like to intrude, but may I have your autograph,
Mr. Mcgovern, on a check?
I got the tab today from my dentist.
Repairing bridgework--
Just send me the bill, first of the month.
I think you'll like this.
Here, look-- will you stop?
I thought you'd like to see what you're paying for.
I beg your pardon.
Look, blow, huh?
Please?
Uh, let me explain.
You see, a few weeks ago,
Mr. Mcgovern, in his usual charming, inimitable style, put the slug on me.
Didn't you, Guffy?
Would you step outside for a moment?
I would be delighted.
Mcgovern...
Oh, sure, sure.
Don't worry.
Yeah? What?
Look, I'm having a little birthday.
Don't louse it up.
You had a couple of drinks.
You feel good.
I feel fine.
Great shape.
Sure. Be a nice guy.
Go on home.
Why should I be a nice guy for you? Give me one reason.
Nobody's bothering you tonight.
Nobody will, and if any certain party tries to bother me,
I'll hook him in the mouth.
Now, wait a minute.
[Woman screams]
I'll take her in.
You stay where you are.
You'll have to carry her.
Up we go.
Come on.
Come in.
Please.
Right up to bed now, dear.
Good night.
Good night.
That's a sweet kid, that one.
Did you have a good party?
Nicest time I ever had in my life.
Happy birthday.
Thanks.
Uh, what happens to the kids here, sister?
What do you mean?
Do they stay here forever?
Doesn't anybody ever come around and, you know...
Adopt them?
Occasionally.
Not so often as we'd like.
They all seem to want tiny babies now.
I'd be afraid.
Were you thinking of adopting Bridget?
Who, me?
No, I just, uh...
I...
I couldn't, could I?
Well, it would present certain problems.
There's no law against it, of course, but the court usually doesn't permit children to go to unmarried people.
Yeah, that would be a problem.
I'll pray on it.
Thanks.
It's not that I couldn't afford to keep her.
I got some dough saved.
I just never had anybody to spend it on.
A kid like that ought to have somebody, like a father.
Not that I'm any shining example of behavior.
There have been some times...
And baseball's a pretty tough game, and a lot of people say that I...
Well, maybe you've heard.
I sat in back of first base one day.
Well, I don't have to tell you.
That's all over.
Believe me.
It's a thing of the past.
I keep my mouth shut and my hands in my pockets.
No language.
Not even one fight.
You see, sister, we were in this restaurant, and there was this fella-- good night, sister.
Good night, Mcgovern.
Wait for me, will you?
She's really a sweet child.
She just adores you.
Have you ever thought of adopting her?
Who, me?
I don't see anybody else around here.
Don't be silly.
What would I want with a kid around the house?
Besides, a thing like that presents certain problems.
Well, this is where I live.
What kind of problems?
Problems.
Oh.
It's been a wonderful evening, especially the main event.
I'll bet that's the first black eye you've had in years.
You travel around with me,
I'll fix you good.
Is my face on crooked or something?
Well, yours is.
You better go home and fix it.
And don't believe that beefsteak routine.
That's just superstition.
What it needs is hot and cold applications, preferably Epsom salts.
Look, you make a move,
I'll make a move.
Huh?
A long time ago,
I played third base in Minneapolis.
There was a girl in St. Paul, the nicest girl I ever knew.
We did a lot of talking, and I made some big plans, but they didn't include a certain shortstop, the one she finally married.
It was quite a blow.
I can imagine.
I guess I've been taking it out on everybody else ever since.
Good night.
Good night.
Sister, is it always right to turn the other cheek?
Certainly. Why?
Mr. Mcgovern did last night, and he got sloughed something awful.
The meek shall inherit the earth.
Jenny: I never missed a game after that.
In September, the pirates met the giants in the final series.
They needed three straight games to win the pennant.
Steady there! Make him pitch to you!
Two and two, boy.
Make him pitch to you.
Guffy!
How do you feel?
It's nothing.
I don't feel a thing.
I did it again, didn't I?
Why'd I have to go and wave at you?
It's nothing.
We won, didn't we?
Where am I having dinner?
I mean, where are you having dinner? I mean, us.
You're not going anyplace except home.
I've got a cab.
Hiya, Guffy.
Nice catch.
You ok?
Any permanent injuries?
No. I've been hit in the head 20 times.
I feel fine.
Did you see any angels out there?
I've never seen an angel, but I talk to one regularly.
What did you say?
You speak to angels?
Certainly.
Can we quote you?
Why not? An angel sits in back of me in the dugout every day.
Where are they running?
Let's get out of here.
Uhh!
Sister?
Hmm?
Isn't it wonderful?
I see them, and Guffy talks to them.
"Believe me, gentle listener.
"There is more to this than meets the eye.
"Mr. Mcgovern's antics on the field and off
"are no longer a source of amusement
"but a basis for serious inquiry.
"His latest peccadillo, an admission to the press that he converses with angels--" oh, for heaven's sakes!
You were hit in the head.
You could say anything.
"...is unworthy of the high position
"he now commands, proof beyond doubt
"that Mr. Mcgovern is, to put it charitably,
"emotionally unstable and guilty of conduct
"detrimental to organized baseball.
"Mr. Mcgovern's supporters
"claim his peculiar statement
"was made after being hit in the head with a line drive, therefore, he is not responsible."
He admits it.
I would like to ask
Mr. Mcgovern a question.
Was he responsible seven weeks ago in Boston?
How about it, Mcgovern?
Seven weeks ago, were you or were you not of sound mind and limb?
Beside me in the studio tonight is a man who can answer these questions.
Would you tell us your name, please?
Patrick J. Finley.
What is your occupation,
Mr. Finley?
I'm a groundskeeper at braves field up in Boston.
Will you please tell us what you saw in braves field about seven weeks ago?
Well, I seen
Mr. Mcgovern.
What time?
I don't know.
After the game.
Where was he?
Sitting on second base.
And what was he doing?
He was talking.
Talking to whom?
I don't know.
There wasn't anybody there.
And when he was sitting on second base talking to somebody who wasn't there, where was he looking?
Up.
What did he say?
I don't know exactly.
I couldn't hear everything.
I was in the dugout.
But one thing he said was,
"I have a right to know the name of my own angel."
He said that?
"My own angel"?
Yes, sir.
Then he said again,
"don't go away mad."
Thank you, Mr. Finley.
I ask you, ladies and gentlemen and Mr. commissioner, is this the act of a normal, reasonable man, to hang around second base at night and talk to angels?
Much as I hesitate to say this,
I think that Mr. Mcgovern should take a long, long, perhaps permanent rest.
The pirates chalked up a victory today, squeaking through by one lone run, playing uninspired ball.
They came to life in the final frame to sneak a run over the plate-- nice going, boys!
What's eating you?
So we win a ball game.
So, hurray.
I tell you, it's making me jumpy--angels, angels.
Every time I go after a ball,
I'm afraid I'm going to trip over something.
Shut up.
Did you watch Mcgovern out there looking over his shoulder every two seconds?
It's scary.
For all we know, this guy is off his rocker.
He might even be dangerous.
Lay off Mcgovern.
I don't care if he's talking to fence posts.
He's trying to be a right guy.
Your job is to play ball for him and keep your mouth shut, understand?
Ok, Saul.
Here he comes.
Announcer: And here's a flash that was just handed to me.
Arnold P. Hapgood, commissioner of baseball, will arrive in Pittsburgh tonight.
He is here to investigate
Guffy Mcgovern.
Well, that sounds like bad news for Pittsburgh.
With the pennant hanging on tomorrow's game,
I'm afraid the pirates and Mr. Mcgovern are in a pretty tough spot.
The pirates played mighty shaky ball out there this afternoon.
With this hanging over their heads, there's no telling what they'll do.
It's about my boys.
They're getting nervous, not that I blame them, but if it keeps on like this, they're apt to come apart tomorrow.
I thought maybe you might have something to suggest.
Nervous, huh?
Well, I wouldn't worry too much about it.
It's only natural at a time like this.
How are you doing?
Me? Great.
I'm in the pink.
One game away from a pennant, and they're trying to throw me in the loony bin.
I don't sleep nights.
I don't eat.
Just to make matters worse,
I'm fresh out of pitchers.
That so?
You know. I used four this afternoon.
Who do I start tomorrow?
Yeah. Well, I wouldn't worry about it.
Excuse me.
You got nothing to worry about.
You're all set.
With me, it's a little different.
Yeah?
Yeah. Martin's got a bad arm,
Clark's on the sick list, and Hellman's an old man.
He wouldn't last two innings.
Yeah. Saul's pretty tired.
Even I couldn't make him look good.
16 years is a lot of pitching in the major leagues.
It's his last one.
Next season they'll want to send him to the minors.
That won't make any difference to Saul.
He won't be around next season.
We're signing him up in the spring.
Saul?
Yeah. Everybody gets to play up here sooner or later.
But Saul...
We were friends.
At least we used to be.
Hellman was a great pitcher once.
He pitched a two-hitter in a world series, you know.
Yes, I know.
I was there.
Excuse me.
Good night.
Good night, Guffy.
This way, commissioner.
Commissioner, could you give us a few words about tomorrow?
Gentlemen, I have an appointment with all parties concerned tomorrow morning at 9:00, so until I hear all the evidence,
I have nothing to say.
The pirates are playing their last game of the season tomorrow afternoon for the pennant.
I'm aware of that.
Do you think is this the proper time to conduct the investigation?
Any time is the proper time when the situation warrants it.
Baseball is for the people who support it.
My desk is piled high with letters.
From New York, sir?
New York and other places.
In other words, you think Mcgovern has flipped his lid?
The hearing takes place tomorrow morning.
Oh, but,
Mr. commissioner...
Jenny: The hearing was like a courtroom trial.
The investigation hinged on two points.
One--are there such things as angels?
And two--is it possible to talk to them?
How long have you been practicing psychiatry,
Dr. Blane?
18 years.
You've just heard
Mr. Mcgovern's account of how a group of angels helped his ball team.
As a psychiatrist, how did his story impress you?
Belief in celestial beings is a carryover from mankind's ignorance and fear of his environment.
Originally, man worshipped the sun, the moon, stones, trees.
But with the rise of religion as we know it today, man felt the need of a closer alliance with a supreme being, and so he invented the angel.
Invented?
Precisely.
Just as a hurt child will run to its parent, so will a man turn for comfort to a belief in angels.
And when this belief takes the form of, uh, actual conversation with angels, what is your professional opinion?
Well, I'd prefer not to say, but...
I'd be happy to see you,
Mr. Mcgovern, in my office.
[Laughter]
Uh...
Ahem.
I think that'll be all, doctor, and thank you.
[Whispering]
Uh...
Mr. commissioner.
Yes?
I'd like to introduce three witnesses for the defense.
Yes, yes, of course.
Uh, gentlemen.
Mr. commissioner,
I do not know any of these gentlemen.
My name is Guffy Mcgovern.
Dr. Eustace Danforth,
Trinity church.
How do you do?
Rabbi Allan Hahn, temple Israel.
How do you do?
Father O'Hoolihan, church of our lady, queen of the angels.
Commissioner:
Uh, gentlemen, just make yourselves comfortable.
Mr. commissioner?
Uh, I suppose you gentlemen know the general idea in back of this inquiry?
Well, what do you think?
Uh, do you suppose there might be angels?
Right to left.
Lead the way,
Dr. Danforth.
To deny the existence of angels is to deny the word of the holy Bible, which is specific on the subject.
From the ancient Hebrew text, we have the words b'Nai Elohim-- the sons of god,
Kedoshim-- the holy ones, and mala-- mala-- how do you pronounce that?
Malachim.
Thank you, rabbi.
Malachim-- the messengers.
All of these may be translated "angels."
You'll check me on that, rabbi Hahn?
It was an angel who guided the children of Israel to the promised land.
"Behold, I send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way."
In psalms, again we find an angel-- the protector of man.
"The angel of the lord
"encampeth round about them that fear him and delivereth them."
Mcgovern:
Father O'Hoolihan?
Seeing as how there are whole coveys of angels flitting through the pages of the holy scriptures, both old and new testaments,
I don't see how I can get out of saying
I believe in them.
I imagine the commissioner does, too.
Oh, please, just leave me out of this.
Uh, Mr. commissioner...
Yes?
Father, would you also believe that, uh, they play baseball?
What's that?
Well, Mr. Mcgovern has testified that, uh, angels helped his team.
Well, now, considering all the great wonders that angels have performed,
I'd be much surprised if they couldn't play baseball, providing, of course, they had a mind to.
But would they?
With all respect to your cloth, gentlemen, is it likely that one of your angels or a group of angels would lend support to a man like Guffy Mcgovern?
Is it possible that angels would aid and comfort such a man?
"If a man have a hundred sheep
"and one of them should go astray,
"doth he not leave the 99 in the mountains and go and seek that which is gone astray?"
Matthew, chapter 18, verse 12.
Besides, the lord isn't as small-minded as some of us mortals.
And now,
Mr. commissioner,
I had a short talk with rabbi Hahn in the elevator, and we both discovered we're seeing a ball game at 1:30, so if you don't mind...
No, of course not.
Uh, you'd better hurry.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Thank you.
If Dr. Blane would care to see me in my office,
I'd be very happy, indeed.
[Laughter]
Hey, fellas...
Where are you sitting?
[Both laugh]
Anything further that you'd like to add, Mr. Mcgovern?
Nothing.
Well, gentlemen, I have listened to both sides of this argument, and frankly, I'm baffled.
I'm sure we'd all like to believe in angels.
I know I would.
But if only I had just one tiny bit of concrete evidence.
However...
[Door opens]
Mr. commissioner?
Yes?
This is Bridget white.
She wants to testify for
Mr. Mcgovern.
Mr. commissioner, a minute ago you were all set to make a decision.
Let's get on with it.
I don't want anyone hammering away at this kid.
Sister, will you please get her out of here?
If the commissioner wants to hear about angels, he ought to ask someone who's seen them.
Mr. Mcgovern, what are you afraid of?
All right, you just sit right down here.
Uh...What is your name, little girl?
Bridget white.
8 years old.
Oh, yes. And where do you live, Bridget?
Saint Gabriel's home for orphan girls.
You believe in angels, don't you?
Doesn't everyone?
No.
No, they don't.
But I saw them...Twice.
And where did you think you saw these angels?
In the ballpark.
They were helping the pirates.
You're quite sure about that?
You wouldn't, uh, just make up a story, would you?
Oh, no.
It's bad to lie about anything.
But if you lied about angels,
I guess that'd be real trouble.
Mr. commissioner, may I question the witness?
Certainly, certainly, certainly.
Now, Bridget, when you, uh...
When you saw your, uh, angels, what were they doing?
Well, there was one standing behind
Mr. Mcgovern.
But, uh, you didn't see him talk to Mr. Mcgovern.
No. But I know he must have.
Why?
Because Mr. Mcgovern said so.
And you think that one of your angels, one of these heavenly messengers, would talk to a man like Mr. Mcgovern?
Of course. Any angel would be proud to talk to a nice man like Mr. Mcgovern.
[Laughter]
Commissioner:
Quiet. Quiet, please.
Is that all, sir?
Mr. commissioner,
I hope we're not going to accept this as testimony.
The child is obviously prejudiced.
What are you talking about?
I will decide what is evidence here.
Isn't it true that you tried to adopt this child?
Haven't you recently made a declaration of this intention to the orphans court?
Suppose I did.
What about it?
Why, Mr. Mcgovern...
There's nothing definite yet.
I don't even know if the court will let me have her.
You don't just walk in and adopt a child.
There's problems.
Oh, there's no problem here, Guffy.
Nevertheless, you wanted to adopt her.
Oh, that's nice.
It's touching!
The little girl who saw the angels now stands up to testify for
Mr. Mcgovern.
But isn't she actually testifying for papa?
Ooh!
Guffy!
Stop that!
Jenny:
Guffy!
[Thunder]
Commissioner: Order!
I said order.
Jenny:
Don't do it, Guffy!
[Shouting]
Jenny: Stop it!
Guffy, stop it!
Guffy! No!
[Shouting]
Jenny:
Guffy, don't!
Make him stop!
Guffy, don't!
Gentlemen, I think...
In view of the facts...
All things considered...
This case is dismissed.
What's with Guffy?
Read about it!
He got all his marbles?
Sure, sure.
He was ok all the time.
He ain't no more crazy than I am.
Hey, Guffy, here you are!
[All talking at once]
Come on, Mcgovern, what do you say?
That was a nice little fracas you staged, Mcgovern.
Quite a show.
Look, you heard what the fella said.
What else could I do?
You had no right to slug him.
I warned you about that twice.
Ok, keep your shirt-- keep your wings on, huh?
You talking to me?
Just stick to your driving, will ya?
I only hit him once or twice.
You completely destroyed his bridgework.
All right. I'm sorry.
Well, you ought to be because when you busted that bridgework, you also busted our agreement.
What do you mean?
We're through with you.
From now on, you're on your own.
Please! Don't make jokes!
I didn't say nothin'.
It's no joke.
We're all finished.
Look, a pennant's hanging on that game today.
You can't walk out on me now. I need you.
Kind of a shame, isn't it?
But don't worry.
You've been on your own a lot of times in the last eight weeks.
I don't like to be on my own.
I'm not happy on my own.
You used to be.
But I'll let you in on a little secret-- you've learned something, Guffy.
You don't know it yourself yet, but you've learned that there's more important things in life than winning ball games.
We're a little proud of you.
Don't be proud of me.
Just be at Forbes field at 1:30.
That's all I want.
Sorry, can't make it, and tell that cabdriver to slow down.
He's making me nervous.
It's a dirty trick.
Who'd ever think that an angel would stoop to such a lowdown, dirty-- so long, Guffy.
No, listen!
Good luck, boy.
Wait! Come back here a minute, will you?
[Horn honks]
How much do I owe you?
Nothing!
[Tires squeal]
You decided who's going to pitch yet?
The boys in the press box are asking.
They want to know who's going to pitch.
Hellman.
What?
I said Hellman!
Let's do it, boy.
[All shout at once]
Batteries for today's game-- for New York...
Barberry catching,
Toley pitching.
For Pittsburgh...
Baxter catching,
Hellman pitching.
No! Not Hellman!
Hellman?
And they say Mcgovern's not crazy. Ha!
Take care of the bullpen, will you?
Yeah, sure.
Do you see anything, honey?
Not yet.
Umpire:
Play ball!
The giants come to bat now with the score still nothing to nothing.
Hellman has managed to hang on for four innings, but it's just a question of time.
[Crowd cheering]
Strike!
And it's over the left-field wall for a home run.
Safe!
There's another hit.
A very close decision down there, but he's safe.
See any angels yet?
You're out!
You're out!
Out at first for a double play to end the inning.
Score--New York, 1,
Pittsburgh, nothing.
Mr. Hellman coming in off the mound.
Looks like a very tired man.
Come on, Vince, boy, let's go to work!
Get a hit, boy!
You're out!
All right, only one away.
Lay into it, Tony, boy!
Lay into it!
Ball.
All right, Lou, get in there, boy, let's go! Let's go!
Come on now, Lou!
Knock it out of the park!
Mandekic pulls up safe at second.
Two away, and rube Ronson coming up.
Rube hasn't had a hit yet.
All right, rube, let's get some runs, boy!
A long, hard-hit ball that bounced off the scoreboard for a home run.
Atta-boy, Ruben!
That's one for Milwaukee high!
Let's get out there and hold them! Come on!
How's it going?
I guess I can get three of them out.
Here we are, at the top of the ninth inning, the final frame with the score still
Pittsburgh, 2, New York, 1.
Hellman is taking the mound again for Pittsburgh, though he seems to be tiring badly.
This is the giants' last chance to tag him, and maybe they will.
One away, boy, one away!
Hellman's touching that arm again.
Seems to be giving him some trouble.
Either it's pain or those giant averages.
Umpire:
Take your base.
And he takes his base, hit by a pitched ball.
Well, Hellman seems to be losing control in there.
[Cheering]
Jumping high in the air and spearing the ball.
Two out, a man on first.
They're getting to him,
Guffy. He'll never make it.
Ball one!
Spectator:
Take him out!
Boo!
Boo!
Take him out!
Get him out of there!
Take him out!
Two men on now, first and second.
Two away.
The fans are yelling to take Hellman out.
Come on, take him out!
Get a pitcher!
Throw the bum out!
Get him out of there!
Take him out!
Get him out of there!
Take a walk back!
Take a walk!
Safe!
You're safe!
The throw was not in time, and all the runners are safe.
Three men on base, two out.
And those pirate fans are really mad now.
A hit could win this ball game.
Spectator: Go on,
Hellman, good-bye!
Get him out of there!
Go to the showers, bum!
Get him out of there!
Take him out!
Yank the bum!
Yank him!
Mcgovern has finally made up his mind to take Hellman out of the game, but, uh, it may be a little late.
What do you think, Saul?
Can you do it?
Well, I'm tired, but I'd sure like to try.
Spectator: Get that bum out of there!
Get a pitcher!
Get a pitcher!
It's your ball game.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Mcgovern has just pulled the bonehead play of his career.
He's leaving Hellman in.
Take him out of there!
Coming up to the plate now is Dobbie Roscalla, who leads the league in runs batted in.
If he bats one now,
Mr. Mcgovern had better leave town.
Strike!
A swing and a miss.
He never connected with that one.
Strike!
Strike two.
Roscalla steps up to the plate again.
It only takes one to hit it.
Hellman's taking his time.
He's a very tired pitcher right now.
Thanks, Guffy.
For what?
You're getting a good man.
Well, there you have it.
Uh...Final score--
Pittsburgh, 2, New York, 1, and, of course, a pennant for the pirates.
I hope
Mr. Mcgovern's angels are pleased with the way things turned out.
Are you happy up there, little angels?
Why don't you shut up?
It was really true, wasn't it?
Somebody must've helped me...
Not only on the ball field, either.
Look what I got.
I wonder who they were.
Walter Johnson...
John McGraw...
Christy Mathewson...
Eddie Collins...
Lou Gehrig...
Babe Ruth.
Great names.
Great guys.
Play ball!
All right, come on, hit it!
[Thud]
They're on now.
Yes, yes, yes.
Rise and pray for all is writ.
All is writ.
If everything is written down, what's the use of getting up?
Oh, Father. You gave me the whole blanket again.
- That's untrue.
- You mean, I took it?
I mean, it is not a whole blanket.
Only half.
Only enough to cover one small girl.
It's empty.
We ate the last loaf for supper.
- Don't you remember?
- Stomachs have no memories.
And I at the moment am all stomach.
Not even a crumb.
Perhaps today will be kind to us.
POET:
Allah, I make a prayer for my daughter.
MARSINAH:
And I, for my father.
POET: Let this day spare her the monkey bites of hunger and want.
Let my verses sell in profusion...
...that my daughter may eat and prosper and wear shoes.
I pray the unselfishness of my father's prayer be noted.
Hmm.
Remove us from Earth
If we've nothing to stay for.
They pray the best...
...who have something to pray for.
Oh, look.
Look, the camel likes your rhymes.
- See, it's an omen.
- I thank you.
POET:
Rhymes. Rhymes for sale.
Rhymes. Fine rhymes, sweet rhymes have I.
Rhymes for sale.
Poetry in profusion.
Rhymes to help you sell your wares.
Charm your wives. Educate your children.
Ah. There's a won'thy citizen.
A rhyme for any purpose you name.
What use has a butcher for rhymes?
Sir, to increase your sales.
What meat do you sell today?
Nothing. Nothing but leftovers of mutton.
Good, good.
The haunch of the paunch
Or the rib of a sheep
Is tasty and tender,
Though priced a bit steep.
The part that you can buy
With no financial frown
Is on the ground
When the sheep's sitting down.
You're mad. Mad.
A man can sell anything in the world except poems.
He can sell poisons, emetics, false noses, but no poems.
BEGGAR 1: Alms for love of Allah.
- Has your hunger grown?
- Like a magic tree.
BEGGAR 1: Alms for the love of Allah.
There are fresh oranges this morning at the Bazaar of the Vendors.
- I'll be there.
- Do not take so many.
- They interfere with your speed of foot.
- Oh, my father's wisdom always guides me.
BEGGAR 2:
Alms for the love of Allah.
BEGGAR 3:
Alms for love of Allah.
BEGGAR 4:
Alms for love of Allah.
BEGGAR 5:
Oh, great master...
...thou shalt live if thou shalt give.
- Ah!
May though soul burn by fire,
O thou dog.
A father sending his daughter to steal.
Could anything be baser than that?
Take note, Allah, how low a human can sink to the bottom.
BEGGARS:
Alms for the love of Allah.
Sir, do you wish to purchase a poem?
Poem? Are you not a beggar?
I beg your pardon.
Do I look like a beggar?
BEGGARS:
Alms for love of Allah.
Alms for love of Allah.
BEGGAR: Open thy purse and let the inflicted bend over the house of Mecca.
Hard father, may Allah ruin thee forever.
BEGGARS:
Alms for the love of Allah.
You can't beg here.
This is one of the best begging locations in Baghdad.
- Oh?
- Why do you think this space is empty?
It's not empty. I'm here.
It must remain empty until old Hajj returns from Mecca.
That begging place belongs to him.
My dear verminous friends,
I am a cousin to old Hajj.
- That's impossible.
- Please, come, consider.
Only a Hajj may sit here. That is the law.
Would I dare risk it if I were not a Hajj?
- Omar.
- Would I?
BEGGARS: Alms for the love of Allah.
- Oh, may Allah give thee ease.
- Alms for a starving brother.
- May Allah give thee ease.
BEGGARS:
Alms for the love of Allah.
Oh, stop it.
BEGGARS:
Alms for the love of Allah.
Alms for the love of Allah.
Alms for the love of Allah.
What's this? Where's old Hajj?
Hajj has gone to Mecca, great sir.
Yeah, this fellow claims to be a member of the family.
A customer of Hajj's, I presume?
I am taking over his practice.
All my life, I have given one dinar each morning to Hajj the Beggar.
I am too old to change beggars.
You say you're too old to change beggars.
Your attitude strikes me as strange.
It's easy enough to change beggars.
What's difficult is to beg change.
Not bad. Ha-ha.
Not bad.
Here, you deserve encouragement. Here.
One dinar is not enough to encourage me.
- Take it. Take it.
- No, it's too little. You're too stingy, no.
Now, the beggars tell us what to give.
Well, here.
- But not for the beggar, for the poet.
- I thank you.
- You disgrace us.
- We mustrt seem to be greedy.
- We're not supposed to notice the amount.
- It's the spirit behind the gift that counts.
Never have I seen a profession more keenly in need of new blood.
As of now, this business is under new management.
BEGGAR 1:
Alms for the love of Allah.
Give me a few dozen dinar, my friend.
And an already pleasant morning will be made pleasanter for both of us.
If you do not wish my blessing,
I'll be happy to give you my curse.
I do not give money away.
I'm a businessman.
May the graves of your ancestors vanish in the spring floods.
May your wives grow warts on their noses.
May your taxes increase.
- May your taxes increase.
- May your taxes increase.
BEGGARS:
May your taxes increase.
May your taxes increase.
May your taxes increase.
- May your taxes increase.
- I sat down, feeling desolated
Bowed my head and crossed my knees
Is fortune really predicated
Upon such tiny turns as these?
Then fate's a thing without a head
A puzzle never understood
And man proceeds where he is led
Unguaranteed of bad or good
Fate
Fate can be the trap in your path
The bitter cup of your tears
Your wine of wrath
Fate can be shade in the desert blaze
Sudden food in a famine found
The sound of praise
Incomprehensible and strange
Fate can play a trick with the twine
To weave the evil and good
In one design
And so my destiny
I look at you and cannot see
Is it good? Is it ill?
Am I blessed? Am I cursed?
Is it honey on my tongue or brine?
What fate
What fate is mine
Fate can play a trick with the twine
To weave the evil and good
In one design
And so my destiny
I look at you and cannot see
Is it good? Is it ill?
Am I blessed? Am I cursed?
Is it honey on my tongue or brine?
What fate, what fate is...
Good morning, O giant men of the desert.
Welcome to civilization.
You are the beggar called Hajj?
Even so am I. Far and wide the name of...
Permit me to correct myself.
My name is not Hajj.
- Silence.
- But my name... But my name is not...
You, what is this beggar's name?
- He said that Hajj, that he...
- Thank you.
But I tell you, you're making a mistake.
It must be a case of mistaken identity.
And l...
POET:
You're making a terrible mistake.
I don't think...
Now I know what you are.
You're slavers.
Slave traders of the desert. Allah! Allah!
- We have him, master. Hajj the Beggar.
- Good.
Such a profitless error. I have nothing.
Oh, glorious chieftain, let me be,
I pray you.
I'm not won'th selling at the slave market.
Look, my bad legs, injured in a fall, unable to bear my weight.
I'm old, foolish, forgetful and broken-brained.
I'm won'thless. Less than won'thless.
Talks a lot, doesn't he?
Are the irons hot?
Quite hot, master.
Take a look at my face.
Do you know me?
I know no one and nothing.
I have no memory.
- I am Jawan.
- Jawan. Oh, no.
Your memory freshens.
Well, it's a famous name, Jawan.
Let me see, it strikes a chord.
You're Jawan the great astronomer.
You dissemble poorly.
I'm Jawan, the robber, the brigand, as you very well know.
But I don't know.
I've no interest in such matters.
By tomorrow, I will have forgotten your face, I could never identify you.
- Bare his belly.
- Why? What for?
We're gonna decorate it with a white-hot coal, gleaming in its navel like a jewel.
- In Allah's name, what have I done?
- Can it be he's forgotten?
Fifteen years ago you put a curse upon me,
Hajj the Beggar.
I have only been Hajj the Beggar since this morning.
- His mind has rotted like a fig.
- I have never seen you before.
I know that. But 15 years ago, you put a curse upon my name, Hajj the Beggar.
Soon after, my only son was stolen from me.
All these years,
I've sought for my son everywhere.
I've offered ransom that would purchase all Persia.
- Now, I am to die soon.
- Oh, let's hope not.
I must find my son in the weeks remaining to me.
The wise men tell me it is your curse...
...that keeps me from him.
- Ah. Do they really?
- How much ransom did you offer?
- Never mind. Remove the curse.
Certainly, of course. Delighted to do the best I can under these conditions.
- Don't haggle. Remove the curse.
- Jawan, you don't understand.
A curse must be removed voluntarily.
That's the law of curses.
A curse is nothing more than a prayer, a prayer for harm.
A prayer is born in the heart, not the mouth.
- You'd pray for me and not mean it.
- For money, I would.
- Would Allah accept prayer that's paid for?
- Aye, indeed so.
Do you not give money to mosques and to holy men?
Do they not bless you and pray for you?
- That is true. Give him a gold piece.
- Is that all your son is won'th?
- Lf my patience snaps...
- You'll have eternity to regret it.
Think, Jawan.
Listen to death chuckling in your chest.
What good will your wealth be when the chuckle becomes a roar?
Your tongue is cunning.
Give him 10 gold pieces.
- A hundred. Do I not offer you your son?
- A hundred?
Happiness on Earth as well as a cushion in paradise?
How much is too much for eternal bliss?
Will I find my son this day?
This day? Possibly within the hour.
Saddle a horse.
A plain mount, it'll go unnoticed.
Don't risk entering the city. You'll be taken by the Wazir's police. Tortured. Beheaded.
If I must die in Baghdad, how can I avoid it?
By staying out of Baghdad.
No man can avoid his fate.
That is kismet.
- Break camp.
- Break camp.
Return to the mountains.
Wait for me there.
Pray well, Hajj the Beggar.
Excuse me, which way is Mecca?
Hey, ho. Hey, ho, ho.
Hey, ho.
I'm rich.
I am rich.
On the rim of torture and death and now, treasure.
Why, I'm the richest man I ever knew.
Today's my day
My day of days
My blessings unfold
In a hundred golden ways
Fate has played the trick with the twine
And woven evil and good in one design
And I can face the sun
No more to dodge, no more to run
I can eat, I can buy
I can sleep in a bed
In the certainty I'm fed and free
For fate has claimed its child
And smiled on me

And hands in every pocket.
WAZIR:
Investigate that laughter.
SUBALTERN:
Wife of wives to the Wazir.
Wife of wives to the Wazir.
CHIEF POLICEMAN:
To the Wazir's wife of wives.
Salaam, Lalume, possessor of my entire heart.
Happiness attend your return.
Salaam, my exalted husband.
Lalume, I sent you to Ababu to negotiate a loan. Did you get it or not?
And I had thought your impatience was for me.
I found a new and wondrous ointment, feel my skin.
Lalume, without that loan, I perish.
Answer me, do I get it?
All the gold 10 camels can carry.
- Heh-heh. Lalume.
- But there is a condition.
A high marriage for the three princesses of Ababu.
Oh, what a nuisance.
I don't need any more wives.
In fact,
I've got more than I've any use for.
My lord, no one knows that better than I.
However, it is not you the sheik of Ababu wants for a son-in-law.
He wishes his eldest daughter to become wife of wives to the Caliph.
To the Caliph?
And her two sisters, second and third wives to the Caliph.
How can I influence the Caliph?
He's too young to understand an honest bribe.
Nor can I frighten him, not while he keeps that certainty of divine destiny.
He's shown not the slightest inclination to marry.
With your wit and enterprise, you will change his mind.
Remember, all the gold 10 camels can carry.
Are they attractive, these three young women?
Judge for yourself, my lord.
WAZIR:
Guards.
CHIEF POLICEMAN:
Guards, bring the Ababus.
Exalted Wazir, may I present Their
Royal Highnesses the Princesses of Ababu.
In the name of our illustrious Caliph,
I welcome you to Baghdad.
What they say?
CHIEF POLICEMAN:
They could not be happy here...
...no matter what their father wants.
- What? Heh-heh. What?
Not happy in Baghdad?
Why, that's impossible.
Well, Baghdad...
Well, it's a symbol of happiness on Earth.
- Fetch me 50 happy people, quickly.
- My lord, it will take a month.
Sacred cats of Nefertiti.
Am I to be balked at every turn?
Will no one cooperate?
Unless I'm served as a Wazir should be...
...I warn you, heads will roll in the dust.
And the streets of Baghdad will flow with the tears...
LALUME: Baghdad
Don't underestimate Baghdad
GUARDS:
A city rich in romantic oriental lore
CHORUS:
Aye
LALUME:
Baghdad
You must investigate Baghdad
GUARDS: And learn a few of the facts
You never knew before
CHORUS:
Aye
LALUME:
Due south of the Garden of Eden
Due north of the Gulf of Aden
Where every male and maiden
Is laden down
With the blisses of Baghdad
This irresistible
Town
When or where
Could you compare high life
To the life you find here
Not since Nineveh, not since Tyre
Not since Babylon turned to mire
For a sin of a kind we never mind here
Where or when ever again low life
Like the life well-known here
Not since Nineveh, not since Sidon
Not since Jericho started slidir
From the din of a horn
That's never blown here
Our palaces are gaudier
Our alleyways are bawdier
Our princes more autocratic here
Our beggars more distinctly aromatic here
Where could you ever pursue your life
With the zeal we feel here?
Not since Babylon read that writing
Not since Jericho heard that trumpet
Not since Nebuchadnezzar's
Hanging garden went to pot
CHORUS: Aye
- Not since that village near Gomorrah got
Too hot for Lot
- No, not since Nineveh
CHORUS: Aye, shabash
Not since Nineveh
Ah ah
- Nineveh
CHORUS: Come to Baghdad, live in Baghdad
Life in Baghdad
Takes you back to Nineveh
CHORUS:
Nineveh!
CHORUS:
Stay in Baghdad, stay in Baghdad
Stay in Baghdad, stay in Baghdad
Stay in Baghdad, stay in Baghdad
Stay in Baghdad, stay in Baghdad
Aye
CHORUS:
When or where
Could you compare high life
To the life you find here
Not since Nineveh, not since Tyre
Not since Babylon turned to mire
For a sin of a kind we never mind here
Where could you ever pursue your life
With the zeal we feel here?
Not since Babylon read that writing
Not since Jericho heard that trumpet, not
Not since
No, no, no, no
Not since Nineveh
Not since
Not since Nineveh, not since Tyre
Not since Babylon turned to mire
Not since Nineveh, not since Sidon
Not since Jericho started slidir
Baghdad is the gayest town
Since Nineveh
Nineveh!
GUARD:
Clear the bazaar.
GUARDS:
Make way for the Wazir.
Clear the bazaar.
Make way for the Wazir.
Clear the bazaar.
All Highest, pardon thy servant.
I should've prevented this indignity.
- I was stepped upon.
- Oh.
Inconceivable, All Highest, but true.
You were incontrovertibly stepped upon.
But it is written that they who defile the royal presence will die.
Great ruler, we will all die.
In your words, there's food for much thought.
Yes, and in my thoughts, there is much room for food.
Can't we return to the palace now and have breakfast?
Certainly not.
Now the official year of mourning for my father is at an end...
...I will assume the official duties.
The Caliph's schedule has no intermission.
Then, my boy, heh, alter the schedule with a wave of your hand.
Omar, the duties of royalty are sacred.
My late cousin, Ultimate of Aden...
...strangled to death on a peach pit rather than interrupt an official function.
In my humble opinion, your late cousin was a... Was a fool.
There are many things that only royalty can understand.
Heh-heh-heh. Yes, it must be.
These roaming roamings in the streets incognito...
...do they serve a purpose?
The Caliph is expected to make incognito visits among his subjects regularly.
And he shall do so.
May we ask ourselves what purpose these visits serve?
We may ask ourselves.
- And may we answer ourselves?
- We may.
Abba, to learn the ways of the people.
Babba, to stimulate our local storytellers.
Cabba, to introduce a romantic note into the dry business of government.
Dabba...
Dabba?
Omar, she is lovely.
My boy, I've never seen that expression on your face before.
It's sickening.
SLAVE TRADER: Slaves for sale.
Gathered from the four corners of the Earth.
Here we have Al Marre of Ankara.
Sold into slavery by her husband.
Come gaze at her. What am I offered?
Gaze at this physique, this marvelous physique.
Powerful. Does lots of work.
Makes cheese. Milks goats.
Manages estates.
Fifty dinar. Fifty dinar.
Gaze at this magnificent physique.
Fifty dinar.
Gaze at this marvelous musculature.
Here she is. Fifty dinar.
- Omar, she is gone.
- Oh, my boy...
...Caliphs don't chase girls through the streets.
- Hurry, Omar, hurry.
- Oh, my boy.
ORANGE VENDOR: Stop that woman.
Stop her. Stop that woman.
Stop the thief. Grab that woman. Grab...
Where are they, you sticky-fingered street girl?
Where are the oranges you stole?
Rest awhile, father of none and son of hundreds.
- Rest till I learn if my daughter be harmed.
- It's all right. Let him go.
- Up then, toad.
- I'll have you jailed for this.
I'll have every last dinar and... It's the... l...
Come on, Father, before he summons the police.
Marsinah, we don't run away from the police. Not anymore.
Why not?
Because of what I hold behind my back.
- What?
- What does it sound like?
- Not copper pieces.
- Not copper pieces.
Suppose you could have anything you ever wanted. What would you wish for?
- Breakfast.
- Oh, my dear child.
Let us have some breadth of vision.
Think big. Very big.
- The other half of the blanket.
- The other half... Oh!
We could buy the other half of the blanket.
Good merchants, set forth your silks and jewels...
...your finest garments and sweetest perfumes.
- My daughter will purchase only the best.
MERCHANT: Who is this happy mad man?
Those who are slow to serve us...
...will naturally be the last to receive our custom.
- It's gold. Gold.
- Gold.
Put it back where you got it.
Never fear, child.
It is honestly got, honestly got.
Oh, Father, I'm afraid.
Sweet Marsinah, our frightened days are behind us.
Try to understand. We are rich.
You know the house out near the pomegranate grove?
You mean the one I've always dreamed we might someday...?
- We're that rich?
- Yes. Yes, my darling.
If it is still for sale, we can buy it.
But keep some of the money for yourself.
You talk only of things for me.
What does a poet need?
What can rival the beautiful things that he invents in his head?
SLAVE TRADER: I have girls.
Able bodied slaves for sale or for rent.
Gathered from the four corners of the Earth.
Able-bodied slaves for sale or for rent.
Gathered from the four corners of the earth.
One hundred dinar.
- Well, come to think of it.
- Think of what?
Well, you should have maids and attendants now.
Fitting for a lady in your position.
Don't you think so?
- I wouldn't know what to do with them.
- Don't worry about that.
I'll get three or four.
No sense in being short-handed.
So many beautiful things.
What shall I buy?
BANGLEMAN:
Baubles, bangles and beads
MERCHANT 1:
Marsinah, buy from me
MERCHANT 2: Marsinah, buy from me
MERCHANT 3: Marsinah, lovely
MERCHANTS:
Marsinah, Marsinah, buy
SILK MERCHANTS:
Worms work on a Chinese terrace
Worms dream of a happy heiress
Wearing their wares
Answer their prayers
BANGLEMAN:
Baubles, bangles and beads
MARSINAH:
Baubles, bangles
Hear how they jing, jing-a-ling-a
Baubles, bangles, bright shiny beads
MERCHANTS:
Marsinah, buy from me
Marsinah, lovely
Marsinah, Marsinah, buy
Think upon the Macedonian oyster
Having indigestion in his watery cloister
So that Marsinah could have a pearl
- A pearl
- Baubles, bangles and beads
Baubles, bangles
Hear how they jing, jing-a-ling-a
Baubles, bangles, bright shiny beads
Sparkles, spangles
My heart will sing, sing-a-ling-a
Wearing baubles, bangles
And beads
I'll glitter and gleam so
Make somebody dream
So that someday he may
Buy me a ring, ring-a-ling-a
I've heard that's where it leads
Wearing baubles
Bangles
And beads
CHORUS:
Ahhh
Ahhh
Baubles, bangles
Hear how they jing, jing-a-ling-a
Baubles, bangles, bright shiny beads
Sparkles, spangles
My heart will sing, sing-a-ling-a
Wearing baubles, bangles and beads
MARSINAH:
I'll glitter and gleam so
Make somebody dream
So that someday he may
- Buy me a ring, ring-a-ling-a
CHORUS: Oooh
ALL:
I've heard that's where it leads
That's where it leads
CHORUS:
Wearing amulets, necklaces
Stars in one's hair
MARSINAH:
Wearing baubles
Bangles
And beads
BANGLEMAN:
Baubles, bangles and beads
Oh. Ladies.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
I feel that I'm wearying you.
Please rest a while.
WOMEN:
Oh, thank you, master.
Frankly, I've never owned slaves before.
I'm a bit vague as to what your rights are.
We have none, master.
Your word is our law.
Well, then we certainly won't have any trouble getting along, huh?
- You are sweet, master.
WOMEN: Oh, yes, you are.
Master, if I werert a slave,
I'd kiss you.
Oh, my dear child, feel free to express your gratitude at all times.
One thing I will not have around the house is class distinction.
- The Wazir's police.
- Oh!
Oh. Be not alarmed.
These fine constables can want nothing from honest, well-to-do citizens.
- Nothing but your name, good sir.
- My name? Why, my name is...
Why do you ask?
Jawan the Brigand was recognized in the bazaar this morning.
- I don't suppose you've seen him?
- Oh, no.
Very well. Name and place of residence?
Uh... Officer, I wonder if we couldn't save ourselves much inconvenience.
I wonder if one piece of gold would serve to identify me suffic...
- Not the whole thing.
- Do you admit possession?
Officer, let there be no misunderstanding.
That is my purse.
And it bears on it the sign of the House of Achmed. Seize him.
- Sign of what?
- The House of Achmed...
...Iooted by thieves this last moon.
You, return these creatures to the slave mongers.
Add the money to the evidence against this thief. Take him to the Wazir.
The Wazir.
SUBALTERN:
Away.
- Ah!
- Please don't scream.
Heh. Why should I scream?
I followed you from the bazaar.
Yes.
Are you accustomed to having men follow you?
Yes. Sometimes at great speed.
It is not fitting for you to answer that way.
You should have said, "No."
I think you have no humor.
Goodbye.
I had an uncle who laughed sometimes.
- Who are you?
- You may call me Haroun.
Oh, of course, I may.
I may call you Mameluke ben Goathead, but who are you?
Please, I don't wish to say just yet.
Oh.
You're a criminal.
No, not a criminal.
At least, not in his eyes.
Not in whose eyes?
Why...
...AIlah's.
Mmm. Splendid reference.
Do you have any others? More local.
I'm afraid not. I am a stranger here.
Oh, not anymore, I hope.
Yes, I know.
That is not a fitting thing to say.
You are...
...very beautiful.
Probably it's just my pretty clothes that attract you.
Having my hair combed...
...and my face washed.
Yes, that would make a difference.
Oh, I like you, stranger.
What is your business?
Your family's business?
We, uh...
- We try to make things grow.
- Oh.
Gardeners.
Gardeners.
Gardener...
Gardener, I do not think this is fitting.
No man has ever touched me before.
And no other man ever shall.
It is his will.
I do not belong to you.
This time I'm speaking of Allah's will.
You are too confusing for me.
Please, take your hand away.
I cannot.
Please.
Oh, why do the leaves
Of the mulberry tree
Whisper differently now
And why is the nightingale
Singing at noon
On the mulberry bough
For some most mysterious reason
This isn't the garden I know
No, it's paradise now
That was only a garden
A moment ago
Take my hand
I'm a stranger in paradise
All lost in a wonderland
A stranger in paradise
If I stand starry-eyed
That's a danger in paradise
For mortals who stand beside
An angel like you
I saw your face
And I ascended
Out of the commonplace into the rare
Somewhere in space
I hang suspended
Until I know
There's a chance
That you care
Wort you answer the fervent prayer
Of a stranger in paradise
Don't send me in dark despair
From all that I hunger for
But open your angel's arms
To the stranger in paradise
And tell him
That he need be
A stranger
No more
You say you're a gardener.
What flowers should I plant along the fence?
I must go in a moment.
Will you meet me here this evening?
I thought hyacinths, but perhaps oleanders.
At moonrise? Here in the garden? Please.
Yes.
Yes, of course.
- Until tonight.
- Tonight.
You won't forget? You won't fail me?
I saw your face
And I ascended
Out of the commonplace
Into the rare
BOTH:
Somewhere in space
I hang suspended
MARSINAH:
Until I know
CALIPH:
Till the moment I know
There's a chance that you care
There's a chance that you care
Wort you answer the fervent prayer
Of a stranger in paradise
Don't send me in dark despair
From all that I hunger for
BOTH:
But open your angel's arms
To the stranger in paradise
And tell me that I need be
A stranger
No more
Bow low for the mighty Wazir.
SUBALTERN:
Bow low for the mighty Wazir.
Silence then obedience.
The court of justice convenes.
The court begins its meditations.
"The case of the seller of candlesticks,
Ibn Nuwas...
...charged with breaking the pottery pots of Ali Dah doud."
Illustrious Wazir, Ibn Nuwas pleads for a postponement of judgment...
...until his broken legs are mended.
He fell from a cushion while being questioned.
Next case.
Great Wazir, we have apprehended a thief...
...with a hundred pieces of gold taken from the house of Achmed.
Let him appear.
Oh. At last, good fortune returns to me.
Good fortune?
The noble Wazir himself, sitting in judgment.
Who could ask for a more righteous, a fairer, a finer judge?
I loathe fawning criminals.
- He doesn't talk like a thief.
POET: Oh.
Let your loveliness be the loot,
O princess...
...and every man is a thief.
CHIEF POLICEMAN:
Silence.
Oh, let him chatter a bit.
- The evidence against this criminal is as fo...
- I need no evidence.
Under the laws of Baghdad...
...I order that the right hand of this liar, rogue and thief be cut off.
Have you aught to say before sentence is executed?
Well, that I am a liar,
I am not a big enough liar to deny.
That I am a rogue can be verified by anyone who knows me.
And that I am a thief is as true as if it were written in the Koran.
But, in this particular case...
...I say, for the first time in my life,
I am innocent.
I dislike being mocked in public.
Add 20 lashes to my sentence.
CHIEF POLICEMAN:
Are you done with your protest?
It is rather expensive, but I should like to continue.
I can understand your indifference that I am innocent...
...O dispenser of justice.
I, the pick purse, the brawler, the collector of women, innocent?
I can hardly believe my own ears.
Tell me, what sort of women did you prey upon?
Till I beheld you, O princess...
...my memory of them was that they were all beautiful.
Oh! It's his tongue that should be cut off.
But let the sentence stand.
Right hand off.
Oh, noble Wazir.
I assure you that I despise innocence as much as you.
It is at best a temporary state.
- What are you bothering me about?
- The small matter of losing my right hand.
As a poet and storyteller, the loss would cripple my career.
- Scoundrel. I'm leaving you your mouth.
- Hold.
For that simple sentence, you needed your hand.
It is the gesture which tells the story.
Let me convince you.
LALUME:
Oh, let him.
I love being convinced.
Dear hand, deft hand
Clever and facile extremity
Fond companion to me
From my birth
Sweet hand, swift hand
Spinner of fable and fantasy
Faithful friend of my art
Would they rend us apart
Leaving no finger or fist there
But just the hint of a wrist there
Where then my spirited wit
My mercurial charm
Am I fated to sit
With an elbow and arm
And no digits to top them off
If they lop them off
How could I plead to you?
How could I pray to you?
How intercede with you?
What could I say to you?
Like a dog with no tail
Like a spoutless whale
Like an elephant sunk
If you cut off his trunk
Hold
I'd like to hear a little more
When you tell a story
Amorous or gory
You can tell it best
If you gesticulate
Suppose the mighty Sinbad
Meets a jinn who's been bad
They will guess the rest
If you gesticulate
A tongue is a tongue
A lung is a lung
And a tale you can shout or sing
Without the gesture, nothing
Nothing.
Should Scheherazade
Undulate her body
That can be expressed if you ges...
Can be assessed if you ges...
She'll be undressed
If you gesticulate
If I tell you I was walking by the sea
And found a genie in a bottle
- That's trite
CHORUS: Quite
For practically everyone has seen a genie
Someone had to throttle
In a bottle
Right, but if I say the bottle
Was so teeny
So teeny
And so was the genie
So was the genie
Until with trembling hand
I pulled the cork
And threw the jug
And covered up my eyes
And the smoke began to curl
And the smoke began to swirl
And it swirled and it curled
And it curled and it swirled
As higher it did rise
Till it was so high
CHORUS:
So high
And so was the genie
So was the genie
- Then two great arms reached down
CHORUS: Two great arms
- And lifted me up
CHORUS: Up
- Up, up
CHORUS: Up, up
- Into the sky
CHORUS: So high, so high
And we did fly
CHORUS:
And he did fly
The genie and I
CHORUS:
How he did fly
- We did sail
- Did sail
- Did sail
- Did sail
Is this a tale?
CHORUS:
This is a tale
- Are you convinced?
- We are convinced
You see
You see
For the facile finger
Listeners will linger
They will be impressed if you ges-
Applaud with zest if you ges...
If it's a question of a story, gory
Sinbad, in bed
Bottle, smoke, genie, arms
Fly, sky, high, I state
Reiterate
POET AND CHORUS:
Gesticulate
With your hands
With your hands
Rather clever, you must admit.
Too clever. Much too clever for an ordinary sort of thief.
I'm sure he's stolen more than a hundred pieces of gold.
Where have you hidden the money?
Believe me, great sir,
I have stolen nothing.
Both hands off for that lie.
What money I have was given me for removing a curse from a mars head.
Oh, you presume to have power over curses?
The power of prayer is infinite, Great Wazir.
And I pray exceedingly well.
Send men to his home.
Bring me who you find.
- All his confederates.
- No.
No, there is no one in my home, no one at all.
Only a wretched, half-mad daughter, ugly, cackle-voiced.
Please, she had done no wrong.
Oh, we've touched a sore spot.
We're on the trail now. Go, hurry
Yes, Great Wazir. Where do you live?
You refuse to answer?
You dare to refuse to answer?
May Allah curse you.
May calamity strike you.
May disaster overwhelm you.
May you be driven from this palace, kicked into the road.
A curse on your head.
A curse on the head of the Wazir of Police. Ah. Aah!
POLICEMAN:
Exalted Wazir.
- Exalted Wazir, we have captured Jawan.
JAWAN: Let me go.
Let me go. Let me go.
There he is. The cheat.
The pretender of powers.
Let me tear out his liver.
Let me rip his belly to ribbons.
He removed a curse from me for 100 pieces of gold.
And he swore I'd find my son before this day was over.
Where, you dog of a thief, where is my son?
Oh, mighty Wazir, have your men release me.
Gaah!
Allah be praised. Allah is merciful.
And Mohammed is his prophet.
That amulet around your neck.
Oh, mighty Wazir, answer an old man one question.
Where did you get it?
This amulet's been with me since childhood.
At last I have found you.
Ali, my little Ali.
What does this mean?
I am your father.
JAWAN:
Oh, Ali, the light of my soul.
I put that amulet around your neck one week before you were kidnapped.
Look.
Here's the other piece.
See how they match.
Why, they fit perfectly.
Yes, of course.
Oh, forgive my taunts, Hajj the Beggar, forgive me.
Allah be praised.
A man with the power to curse and uncurse. A magician-beggar.
JAWAN:
Oh, speak to me, speak to me.
My father's heart aches for one word from its son.
I'll attend to you in a moment.
Oh! What a glorious end to all of my search. Oh.
Speak to me, speak to me.
You are Jawan, the robber and murderer.
Is that true?
Yes, I'm too overcome to say much more.
You said enough. You've confessed to being a criminal of the worst sort.
Take him to the dungeons and dispose of him.
But I am your father.
All the more reason to be rid of you.
For the leading judge of Mesopotamia...
...to have as a father the leading criminal of Mesopotamia, a disturbing thought.
Oh, let me something other from my sors lips than a sentence to death.
- To the dungeons with him.
- Oh, but my Ali. Just to be near my Ali.
My baby, my little baby.
Ali, Ali, the light of my life, my soul.
My sun, my stars, the moon.
Never have I seen a more touching reconciliation.
- We can use this man.
- Yes.
Yes, I rather think so.
Have the kindness to have your menials release me.
Oh. Yeah, you heard him, release him. Heh.
Wait.
Wait, oh, what an idiot I am.
Did you not place a curse upon my head?
With all the venom you could summon?
What became of that curse?
What became of that curse?
Let all mouths close but mine.
HERALD:
Let all mouths close but mine.
The holy, the good, the wise, the just, the omnipotent...
...the commander of the faithful.
Nenone al Raschid Ben Mohammet ibn Khasimoun...
...the Caliph.
Arise, my subjects. Arise and rejoice.
Even the walls of my chambers rejoice at Your Highness' presence.
Your Caliph rejoices at the tidings he brings.
He is pleased to notify his Wazir that he has chosen a bride.
See that the proper proclamations are made.
Tell the foreign embassies all candidates for the Caliph's hand...
...should return to their homes.
May every citizen share his Caliph's happiness.
Ruined.
WAZIR: Ruined, hopelessly, utterly, gracelessly ruined.
Who could have put this wicked spell upon me? Who?
- The beggar.
- You sent for me?
You. It was you who did this.
Reverse my decision in the case of Hajj the Beggar. Magician.
- Restore all his gold to him.
- Yes, Great Wazir.
Heh-heh.
Now, let's come to terms quickly.
How much to lift that curse of yours?
Forgive me, but I can do no more today.
Consider what I've already done.
Suppose we should raise you to the rank of emir?
Emir? Me? An emir?
Lalume, an emir is second only to me.
Don't haggle with the wizard.
He may take offense and turn you into something worse than you are.
My daughter and I...
...members of the nobility.
But only if you undo the harm you've caused and prevent the Caliph's marriage.
Prevent the Caliph's marriage?
Oh-ho-ho, but you are too kind.
It is overwhelming. What a day.
But how could one possibly refuse such an offer?
And how can one possibly accept it?
Don't tell me you doubt your power.
Indeed I do.
As a matter of fact, each time it functions,
I am more and more astonished.
Still it does function. We've seen it.
Yes.
Yes, it does, doesn't it?
- Noble Wazir, I accept your offer.
- Done.
SUBALTERN: Great Wazir.
- Yes?
- Shall we dismiss the court?
- No, I feel good.
I'll sentence the rest of the criminals before my nap.
Come here.
You know when really angered at someone, my husband usually drops him alive...
...from a high battlement onto a long hook.
Thus will you be impaled when he discovers you're a fraud.
Then, may I make a suggestion?
Let's not tell him.
He doesn't need to be told.
He'll know the moment the Caliph marries.
That is why I hesitated before accepting his offer.
But, well, love is an uncertain business.
And if lover's quarrel, as young lovers often do, then I'm an emir.
If not, well, that is kismet.
You'd gamble your life on such a slim chance?
Princess, I have risked floggings for a handful of dates.
I envy you.
Every moment an adventure.
A life totally without monotony.
Yes. That you can say for it.
Since my so-called marriage to the Wazir,
I have waked each morning...
...with the chart of my day staring down at me from the ceiling.
The path of every hour already mapped.
And the map of each hour the same.
Have you ever known that torment?
It is one of the few I have been spared.
You are fortunate.
Afternoons dull
Mornings duller
Duller the nights before
Suddenly you
Suddenly color
I suddenly see
Monotony for me
Will be no more
Bored by the night and the day was I
Seldom gay was I
Before now
In a world without you was I
And I was bored
So bored
Then came your eyes compelling me
Telling me something wild
On your lips lay adventure
And lightning flashed
When you smiled
So smile now
Wake the fires that sleep in me
Make them leap in me
With your kiss
And whatever it is I'll be
I won't be bored
Not bored
Bedeviled, yes
Bedazzled, yes
Bewildered and breathless, yes
But not bored
How could I ever be bored
Not with your lips on mine
Your magical lips
Pressed on mine
Not bored
I will never again
Be bored
What kind of a sentence did he get?
Your gold.
The Caliph's trumpeters.
WOMAN:
Look, they're beautiful.
Silence, you fools.
Silence, you caterwauling trulls.
Well, beggar, why do you not begin your magic?
Now?
Could it be that our great wizard does not know what the music means?
The Caliph is on his way to fetch his bride.
What? Are you certain?
Why are you disturbed?
Did you not promise to stop this wedding?
Great sir, as I've already told you,
I've exhausted today's rations of powers.
- I couldn't possibly...
- I see. Guard.
WAZIR:
Guards, draw swords.
Guards, this reluctant magician...
...is not to leave the palace under any circumstances.
He has a tremendous spell to weave, in which I'm sure he will not fail.
However, should he fail...
- Executioner.
- Executioner forward.
Executioner, prepare the room of the 29 fires.
Watch him carefully, he's slippery.
But I suspect that he is not fireproof.
- What are you doing?
- Shh!
I'm calling on my powers.
Assist me, all of you.
Oh, powers above and powers below.
Ye who weaves at your tanglesome skeins...
...and daily spins the tapestry of agony and joy...
...that mortals call the history of man...
...cup thy ear to Hajj the Beggar.
Aye, shabash.
Goat of Mendes.
Baphomet.
Blight and blast our Caliph's love.
Twice this day hast thou seen fit to grant what I ween.
Twice this day has thou let...
...Hajj's humble prayer climb up heavers stair.
And kismet so ordained.
My goal should be attained.
Another prayer, another cry.
Grant again, grant it,
I ask thee now, ask thee now.
Kismet, mystery of fate.
Fate
Heed me as I lower my knee
A beggar begging your ear
To hear his plea
Fate, let the sound of my voice beguile
Look with love on your slave below
And show your smile
'Tis but a trifle I ask
That in the master design
Which you have written and sealed
You change one line
This love that mustrt be
This he, this she
Turn her smile into scorn
Turn his heart into stone
- Turn the honey on their lips to brine
CHORUS: Ohhh
POET:
Then fate
The day is mine
CALIPH AND CHORUS:
Play on the cymbal
The timbal, the lyre
Play with appropriate passion
Fashion songs of delight and delicious desire
For the night of my nights
Come where the so well-beloved
Is waiting
Where the rose and the jasmine mingle
While I tell her the moon is for mating
And 'tis sin to be single
CALIPH:
Let peacocks and monkeys
In purple adornings
Show her the way
To my bridal chamber
Then get you gone
Till the morn of my mornings
After the night of my nights
CALIPH AND CHORUS:
After the night of my nights
CHORUS:
'Tis the night of my nights
Play on the cymbal
The timbal, the lyre
Play with appropriate passion
Fashion songs
Of delight and delicious desire
For the night of my nights
Come where the so well-beloved
Is waiting
Where the rose and the jasmine mingle
While I tell her the moon is for mating
CALIPH:
And 'tis sin to be single
CHORUS:
Let peacocks and monkeys
In purple adornings
Show her the way to my bridal chamber
Then get you gone till the morn
Of my mornings
After the night of my nights
'Tis the night of my nights
After the night of my nights
CALIPH:
'Tis the night of my nights
MAN:
Marsinah.
MARSINAH: Father?
- Oh, Marsinah.
Thank heavens I found you.
I've looked everywhere for you.
I can't explain now.
- But we have to make a trip to Damascus.
- Damascus?
Oh, my poor father.
Some angry husband again?
Oh, no, it's much worse than that.
I'm in great danger of the Wazir.
His police may be here at any moment.
Come.
- The Wazir?
- Yes, Marsinah, I can't explain now.
- Look I'll tell you all about it as we go.
- Oh.
Father, Father, I can't leave now.
But this is a matter of life or death.
But I was to meet someone here.
Someone...
Police.
MAN 1:
To the bride of the Caliph. Ha-ha.
MAN 2: To the second and third and future wives...
...the All Highest will take now that he has a first wife.
And to the silks he shall buy her.
And the satins and the jewels.
- Gentlemen, to polygamy.
MEN: To polygamy.
So you see, instead of becoming an emir,
I have incurred the wrath of the Wazir.
- Do you understand now why we must flee?
- Yes, I understand.
Help me saddle this beast and we'll get out of here. I'll leave a fair price for him.
MAN 1: Out of the way.
MAN 2: Get out of the way.
- Look.
- Where is Hassan?
Procession is returning without the bride.
Can't be true.
Why would any woman run from the Caliph?
- She just wasrt there.
- News will be all over Baghdad by morning.
Did you hear?
It isn't true. It can't be.
On the contrary, it must be.
Father, you frighten me.
What are you going to do?
Return to the palace and become an emir.
- No.
- But Marsinah.
- No, I won't let you.
- But, Marsinah.
You're not going to put yourself into the clutches of that butcher.
- Marsinah.
- You're no more of a magician...
...than he is. Than that camel is.
Marsinah. Now, listen, you must wait here.
If I have not returned before dawn, you go swiftly and secretly to Damascus.
Here's what's left of our gold.
Ample to buy your living for years.
Keep 10 gold pieces so that you can have a dowry and marry a man of substance.
And keep still another 10 in case that your husband should be mean or cruel.
You give me this...
...instead of my father.
Marsinah, when a mars fortune is on the rise...
...he knows it beyond logic, beyond reason.
Trust me as you always have.
- But I'm content the way we are.
- And?
We have more than enough money to satisfy us.
Only a fool would risk his neck for more.
No, Marsinah, come here.
A fool sat beneath an olive tree
And a wondrous thought had he
So he rose and he told it to the sky
And where was I?
Behind the tree I overheard
His reverie
Why be content with an olive
When you could have the tree?
Why be content to be nothing
When there's nothing you couldn't be?
Why be contented with one olive tree
When you could have
The whole olive grove?
Why be content with a grove
When you could have the world?
The fool stood beneath the olive tree
"What a wondrous thought," said he
But alas, it is very, very deep
And so he yawned and went to sleep
Because, you see
He was a fool
Why be content with an olive
When you could have the tree?
That which has lulled you to sleep, fool
Has awakened me
Why should I sigh that my lot is my lot
That I can't make it anything more
When that is a lie
An excuse for a fool to snore
I walked
From behind the olive tree
With a wondrous change in me
For I walked with my eye upon a star
If you have heard and do not heed
There is a word
For what you are
And, oh, my friend
The word is
Fool
Lalume.
Bow low for the Mighty Wazir.
- Lalume.
LALUME: My lord?
Lalume, he's succeeded.
Our wizard has succeeded.
I'm not surprised, are you?
I am flooded with relief.
Had the Caliph married that backyard bride...
...why, I truly believe
I'd have had to kill myself.
My dear husband, you will never have to kill yourself.
Now, where is he now, do you suppose?
I shall have to destroy him as soon as possible.
Destroy him? Why?
A man who's abetted me in a treasonable act, knowing what he knows, how could I let him live?
Of course.
But what a pity though.
Think of the power you are throwing away.
Imagine the Wazir of police with a wizard in his employ.
Power within power.
Power.
- Yes.
- You could change the face of Baghdad.
All Persia.
All Arabia might be yours.
Oh, wise, Lalume.
We must befriend him.
Make him a permanent guest in our home.
Then persuade him to put his talents to our use.
But perhaps he won't return.
- Perhaps he...
- He will return.
- How can you be sure?
- You'd just be angry if I told you.
- Oh, nevertheless, I wish he would... Oh!
- Your wish is my command.
Oh. Greetings, great wizard. Heh.
Well done. Excellently done.
I thank you.
Oh, your patent of nobility awaits only your signature.
Your coronet,
I shall bring with my own hands.
Oh, inform the harem to entertain my magical guest.
To delight him continuously.
Feed him sweetmeats and watermelons.
Feed him rahadlakum.
It shall be done, my lord.
- Rahadlakum?
- An ecstasy of taste.
A delight that will steal your brain away.
Well, some other time, perhaps.
Without my brains, I am defenseless.
LALUME: What's wrong?
- Ahem.
You are hostile.
Great Lady, I have but one goal.
To take my coronet of office...
...collect my grant from the Caliph's treasury and live in well-fed obscurity.
I want you to remain here.
In what capacity?
Your fullest.
- Lalume.
- Hmm?
You have saved my life and befriended me.
And I'm grateful.
But you know me as I know you.
We are practical people who live by real values in Allah's name.
- Let's not try to fool each other.
- I'm not trying to fool you.
- Not at all.
- But I have a daughter. I can't desert her.
Your daughter would be as safe here as you.
- Safer.
- Yet, I'm no magician.
How long do you think I could live under the Wazir's roof before he found out?
About 30 years.
Guard.
- The Emir Hajj commands you.
- Uh...
Go to the camel stables hard by the street of the vendors.
You'll find a young lady there who'll answer to the name of Marsinah.
- You fetch her to me.
- Immediately, Emir Hajj.
Emir Hajj.
Can it really be?
- Come with me.
- Where?
- To the harem.
- Must I?
Pretty poet. I would like the Wazir to believe it was his harem...
...that enticed you to remain here.
It would simplify our lives.
I understand.
On days when my lord groweth restless
And bored with his sword and his plume
His handmaiden hath what he needeth
And what doth he need
Rahadlakum
On nights when my lord looketh listless
And black is the hue of his gloom
His handmaiden hath what he lacketh
And what doth he lack
Rahadlakum
'Tis sweet with the meat of the litchi nut
Combined with the kumquat rind
The kind of confection
To drive a man
Out of his Mesopotamian mind
And lo, if my lord feeleth faithless
And roameth by night from his room
His handmaiden fanneth her fires
And out of her pan
Riseth a tantalizing perfume
He scenteth the scent
He turneth his face
His previous place in her embrace
He doth resume
And love is in bloom
The while they consume
- Rahad
- Rahad
BOTH:
Rahadlakum
Oh, gracious emir...
...everyone marvels at your wizardry.
May an humble servant plead the benefit of your magic?
He may.
My third wife is soon to spawn a child.
I now have seven daughters.
Will the gracious emir this time grant me a boy?
My good man, this assurance I can give you.
If it is not a boy, it will not be my fault.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You know,
I wouldn't be surprised if he did have a boy.
After all, didn't the Caliph's commoner disappear as I guaranteed?
Did not Jawan find his son?
Could it possibly be that I actually do possess the power?
Ahem. Allah, this is me again.
Restore my missing tooth.
No magician.
Just an ordinary man.
Far from ordinary.
WAZIR:
Lalume.
WAZIR:
Lalume, why don't you answer?
Where's Hajj?
Oh, bother, he's disappeared again.
- Ah.
- Gah!
My coronet.
Where were you this time?
That would be hard to explain to a layman.
Your Emirship.
Your Emirship.
I thank you.
- How do I look?
- Ooh, heh-heh. Magnificent.
Does he give you a kind of creepy feeling?
Do you mean a sort of tingly sensation under the skin?
- Yeah.
- He certainly does.
Perhaps now you'll remain here as our guest.
Magician though I may be,
I am unable to tear myself away.
All Persia, all Arabia, all Mesopotamia...
SUBALTERN:
Great Wazir?
Yes.
- Great Wazir, a summons from the Caliph.
- Hmm.
Call my litter.
Enjoy yourself, friend. I shart be long.
Now, let's see, where were we?
About here, I think.
Oh, I'm being foolish. Not now, not here.
But when, Lalume? And where, Lalume?
And in heavers name, how soon can we be there, Lalume?
I have heard of an oasis in the desert, about a week's journey by dromedary.
- Not that I've ever been there.
- Of course not.
It is called the Oasis of Delightful Imaginings.
No one around for miles and miles.
The sound of palm trees rustling in the distance.
Warm desert winds caressing your skin.
Glorious emir.
- Yes.
- The lady has been brought as commanded.
Marsinah.
Marsinah.
- Oh, Father, you're safe.
- Yes, of course.
I was so worried about you, with you here in that butcher's clutches.
Eh-eh-eh... Marsinah, may I present the butcher's wife?
My daughter, Marsinah.
- Forgive me, great lady.
- Uh...
Notice anything, Marsinah? Ahem.
- An emir. You really are.
- Yes.
She must have gowns and silks befitting her station.
My dressmaker will prepare a selection for your choice.
Thank you.
- Father, can we leave this place now?
- Hmm?
I didn't want to ask while she was still here, but please.
You have your emirship.
Isn't that enough?
Please, let us leave and buy our pretty house.
But you prefer a house to a palace?
Father.
Father.
I tried to tell you before.
- I have fallen in love.
- Oh.
It was there that I met him.
Maybe he'll come back.
At a time like this, you talk of infantile infatuation.
It's love, Father.
It is real and deep as the one I feel for you.
Marsinah.
Please forgive me. L...
I didn't realize.
I'll never find him again.
There's no way. L...
- I don't even know his name.
- Darling.
- Where he lives, nothing.
- Darling, please. Please don't cry.
We'll find him.
Now, what's he like, huh?
Can you describe him?
Wazir, all your men, your entire force...
...is to be set upon the task of finding a certain young woman.
Your Caliph has already described her to his councilors who will assist you.
Start the search immediately.
Immediately, highness.
A gardener? Hmm.
Well, tell me a little more about him.
Is he a tall gardener?
Short gardener?
I don't know anything else.
Well, now, come, let's have some facts.
Were his eyes gray?
Brown?
His eyes were...
Oh, Father, we talked only for a few moments.
He touched my hand.
You'd say his eyes were
Sometime bright
But only sometime
Often dark
Well, that is plain
Plain words can't tell the thrill
Then tell it how you will
Dawrs promising skies
Petals on a pool drifting
Imagine these
In one pair of eyes
And this is my beloved
Strange spice from the south
Honey through the comb sifting
Imagine these
On one eager mouth
And this is my beloved
CALIPH:
And when she speaks
And when she talks to me
Music
Mystery
And when she moves
And when she walks with me
Paradise
Comes suddenly near
MARSINAH:
All that can stir
All that can stun
All that's for the heart's lifting
Imagine these
In one perfect one
And this is my beloved
CALIPH AND MARSINAH:
And this is my beloved
Wazir, why have I had no tidings?
All Highest, the search is barely under way.
We have so little information to start with.
You mean you have nothing to report?
Nothing at all?
Great ruler, I need time.
True, Wazir, true.
But a royal marriage has been promised the people.
And a royal marriage must be given them.
Exactly the point I was about to make.
You were?
Proceed.
Permit me to observe the illusion that you can be happy with one woman...
...it's a phase man goes through.
If Your Highness would glance into my harem...
...my wives are entertaining three ravishing young guests.
I am not in the mood, Wazir, for visiting other mers harems.
Not a visit, highness, a glance.
I have secret means of watching.
It's a small device from which I've derived a great deal of innocent amusement.
The simple creatures do not know they're being observed.
They are the princesses of Ababu.
Note their charms.
Consider that an alliance with them would mean a safe northern frontier.
I do not require your advice on military security.
But if you would look again, highness, it is not military security I'm offering.
It is she.
It is.
Here in your harem.
My boy. My poor boy.
But this is impossible. Impossible.
Your Highness...
...one marries so many people.
Of course, she cannot now become your wife.
But if you'd care to have her as a concubine, with my compliments.
Concubine?
No, Wazir.
It was not a concubine I sought.
But I don't understand.
A harem wife to the Wazir of police walking alone in the bazaar?
How is it possible?
She must have bribed the guard.
You. Get me the facts.
Yes, Excellency.
I pray Your Highness does not blame me for his disappointment.
The incident is closed.
I shall hold a diwan this very night.
You may present your three princesses of wherever it is.
Inform marriage missions from other nations...
...to present their candidates for the Caliph's hand.
This night will he choose a wife of wives.
Well, where'd she come from?
The new emir brought her.
Oh, my brilliant magician.
He transferred the woman to my own harem.
His power is unbounded and therefore so is mine.
Bring me the girl.
Put her over there.
The Caliph believes this woman to be one of my wives.
I would not have him discover me in a lie.
Ah. Witness this ceremony and enter it into the records as of a month ago.
Empowered as judge of Baghdad to create and cause marriage...
...between two true believers...
...I officially accept this creature as wife of the 7th rank. Therefore, be she mine.
Huh?
Congratulations.
- What is your name, woman?
- Marsinah.
What has happened?
- Marsinah, the Wazir has taken you as a wife of the 7th rank.
Have her scrubbed and anointed.
I shall visit her after the Caliph's diwan tonight.
If you do, I'll kill myself. I swear it.
Really? Oh, this may be the first interesting wedding night...
...I've had in years. Hmm.
Inform the embassies to present their candidates for royal marriage...
...at the diwan tonight.
Excellency, you dare not take that risk.
Suppose the All Highest chooses the wrong bride?
I'm taking no risk at all.
My magician shall officiate at the ceremony.
All Highest, the emir of whom I told you.
Let the diwan begin.
Oh, Prince of True Believers, first of the enchanting maidens...
...who aspire to the incredible honor of becoming your wife.
The beauteous Zubbediya of Damascus.
Sire, perhaps your guards should advance a pace.
CALIPH: Why so?
- Princess Zubbediya is charm incarnate.
One cannot forget that Damascus is a province famous only for the fact...
...that your great grandfather was assassinated there.
O commander of the faithful, a second contestant for your noble heart.
Samaris of Bangalore.
Alluring as the mirage, pulsing as the sirocco.
And agile as the mongoose.
And now...
...now, Great Caliph, the three princesses of Ababu.
O imperishable ruler, it is said in the Koran...
...that he who looks out of three windows sees more than one olive tree.
So devoutly do these princesses desire your happiness...
...that they have put aside the natural rivalry of womankind.
And each is prepared to marry that third of you, which she can serve best.
Ah. The delight in your eyes shows your decision.
O fount of wisdom, all Baghdad will rejoice...
...and all Ababu as well.
Your Caliph has made no decision.
You have your curses ready in case he chooses Samaris or Zubbediya?
As ready as ever, Great Wazir.
You know, I'm consumed with curiosity as to what trick you would use.
- Couldrt possibly give me just a hint?
- No, l...
All right, I understand. Forgive me.
- Secrets of the trade.
- Hmm.
Oh. Oh-ho, by the way...
...that was an ingenious feat of magic you performed today.
Which?
Oh. Transferring the Caliph's beloved to my harem.
What?
- Oh, oh. Just routine wizardry.
- Wonderful. Heh-heh.
But you should have told me.
I thought all was lost when the Caliph saw her this evening. Heh.
I told him that she was one of my wives.
- A jeweled brain.
- Heh-heh.
And then, just to protect myself,
I married her.
She swore she'd kill herself.
Angry little thing.
Can't understand what attracted the Caliph.
What's her name?
Marsinah. That's it, Marsinah.
Marsinah.
- No.
- Yes, yes, Marsinah.
In Allah's name, what have I done?
Oh, that's all right.
She won't be a danger to us for long.
In fact, she'll cease to exist very soon after I get down to my palace tonight.
Heh-heh.
Oh, look at him, descendant of Mohammed, outwitted by an ordinary mortal.
A knife.
The trick has something to do with a knife.
I have written the name of Ababu upon it.
Hide it in your boot.
- My boot?
- Quickly or you'll spoil the trick.
My boot. Ha-ha.
Mighty Caliph, behold.
What have you there?
A blade of virgin iron, All Highest.
As you can see...
...nothing is written upon it.
My lords, ladies.
I throw it thus into the pool.
When retrieved from the water...
...the magic blade will be inscribed with the name of our Caliph's bride-to-be.
Noble Caliph, lest you suspect fraud...
...your loyal Wazir himself will retrieve it from the bottom of the pool.
- Who? Me?
OMAR: The Wazir?
Only he can serve the end I have in mind.
Wazir, explain this fellow's arrogance.
He is a man of wondrous magic,
Your Highness.
The most potent of wizards.
- Proceed.
- Your indulgence, All Highest.
Too much light quarrels with my art.
May they smother all the torches but this one?
This trick may take a little while.
O most tender of lords.
Now?
Now.
All the way to the bottom, my brilliant assistant.
Have no fear. I am here to help you.
Your foot. Give me your foot.
My foot?
Uh... Heh.
This feat, if you trouble to try, will help you to understand...
...the infinite slowness of eye compared to the speed of hand.
He seems to be struggling.
If I didn't know that he was a magician,
I'd swear the man was drowning.
Yes, he struggles well, doesn't he?
All part of the illusion, of course.
Let me assure you, he is doing exactly what I wish him to do.
Gentle ruler, be not angry when I say...
...your subjects have been told your heart is broken.
Perhaps your heart has died.
What judgment would you pass if your love were lost because a lie spoken?
- What judgment upon the man who lied?
- Why do you ask? Whom do you accuse?
A lover of torture, a drinker of tears, who laughs aloud when the innocent weep.
And to all beseechments turns stone-deaf ears.
Who is this man? Name me his name?
A bargain, great Caliph.
Name me his sentence first.
His death, without delay and without mercy.
I thank you for your verdict.
It has been carried out.
CALIPH:
The Wazir. Rescue the Wazir.
Guards. After the assassin.
Don't let him escape.
CALIPH:
Has my physician been summoned?
PHYSICIAN:
Here, All Highest.
GUARD 1:
Come back.
- Where's the assassin?
- This way.
Find the traitor.
PHYSICIAN:
Here we are. Let's go.
MAN 1: Does he live?
MAN 2: His heart is quite still.
PHYSICIAN:
Hold.
I hear a beat. He lives.
- Father.
- Marsinah.
POET:
It's all right.
You are safe now.
Everything's gonna be all right.
You attempted murder before the very eyes of the protector of the faithful.
You have defiled his presence.
- Noble Caliph, l...
- Silence.
For a crime such as yours, there is no defense to be spoken.
No defense to be spoken, All Highest.
But a living defense.
A breathing one, my daughter.
Then the magiciars story was true.
Entirely true, sire.
She was not the Wazir's wife, All Highest.
Not until after you left there.
Then she was seized and married by force.
Such a marriage shall have life no longer than my Wazir.
- The gardener.
- Not the gardener, my dearest.
- The Caliph.
- Marsinah?
Your name is Marsinah?
Only Marsinah.
I am no more than what I seemed.
And I am no less than I seemed, no less in love, no less humorless.
Is this man be pardoned, O Caliph?
Pardon him, All Highest.
His crime was a service. Let him go free.
No. Don't ask that.
Under the circumstances...
...it would embarrass the All Highest to pardon his father-in-law.
Oh, prince of justice, let me help you to compose this most difficult of verdicts...
...against a man who in his life never once did right.
And never once wronged anyone.
Condemn the scoundrel to some dreadful oasis.
At least a week's camel journey away.
Force him to take with him the widow of the soon-to-be-late Wazir.
And all the property she can get...
...before the accounts are audited.
Condemn him to lighten her sorrow...
...and to toil ceaselessly...
...to remove all grief from her heart.
You have just condemned yourself for life, my lord.
And finally,
O prince of true believers...
...take from me my greatest treasure, my daughter, Marsinah.
Take her away forever, by marrying her to the end of her days.
Such is the Caliph's pleasure.
And so he orders.
Princes come, princes go
An hour of pomp and show they know
Princes come and over the sands
And over the sands of time
They go
Wise men come ever promising
The riddle of life to know
Wise men come
Ah, but over the sands
The silent sands of time
They go
Lovers come, lovers go
And all that there is to know
Lovers know
Only lovers know

She's looking for her cousin
He'll find your cousin for you. He finds everything l must go and get my paycheck
Another one for the collection.
Nice girl
-She is naive.
-Yeah, right. l know you
-Watch out, Mira is around.
-Orpheus!
-Didn't l tell you?
-Orpheus!
Sorry to break up your party.
Are you telling her fortune?
-Why not?
-No way!
With her looks, she'll only have bad luck
You're too much of a show-off to deserve good luck
Are you coming?
She is crazy
-Have you been to carnival?
-No, l have not
-ls that why you came?
-No
You'll end up going.
No one can resist the madness
See? There is no mistake
Just follow this path and you'll find the place
-Thank you very much.
-My name is Hermes lf you get lost again, please come back l'm always here, l am the station guard
Thanks. Some day l'll be back
You're loaded! Hand it over, let me see it
Did you get the directions?
Yes, thanks
-Do you know her?
-No
-Why so much fuss then?
-Because l am very kind
-Kind?!
-lsn't she cute?
-What about me? Let's go!
-Where to?
See, Hermes? He is cynical to the point of asking ''where to''
Don't you remember that we are getting married?
-Pay attention, man!
-What eyes she has!
And l have a good memory, you know? l know! Poor guy!
Enough!
-Where is the fifth forum?
-1 st floor, 2nd door, right side
Take your hat off!
Fix your tie. What a mess
Let me fix it, let me
-Give me a kiss.
-There's people coming
Come
Marriage license?
Sorry! lt's for tomorrow
No, for today.
We want a license
-We want to get married, right?
-Are you sure?
-Of course! Why do you ask?
-Sorry, l was just kidding l said that because everybody comes here to get married lt is quite funny
Names? What is your name?
-Orpheus.
-Orpheus
Obviously, the bride's name must be Eurydice
My name is not Eurydice.
Why do you say that?
Because everybody knows that
Orpheus loves Eurydice
Do you love some woman called Eurydice? l don't know any
Eurydice! What is this?
Nothing... nothing. That's an old story. Just kidding
That's not funny at all! l'm not interested in these old stories, Orpheus
My name is Mira
Let's go, Mira!
Are you happy now?
You got what you wanted
-Are you buying me a ring?
-What ring?
Now that we are engaged, you must give me a ring
-With what money?
-You did get your paycheck!
-You won't do it? -l've got to get my guitar out of hock
That's what interests me.
Tomorrow is carnival. A ring?
-Silly! Buy your own ring!
-No, you have to give it to me! l told you, l have no money!
-l can loan you some.
-All right!
But you're the one who has to get me a ring! Come on!
-What else do you want?
-First my guitar!
Orpheus... Orpheus
You will look beautiful as a king! l am the king!
Leave it here on the bench...
Enough
-What is this? -These crooks aren't interested...
-All right, all right.
-Hold it. Look, it works well!
This relic is worth much more than 1 00 cruzeiros...
Any museum would pay alot for this. And it plays well l just need the 1 00 cruzeiros l just want 1 00 cruzeiros for carnival. lt plays well l know. Here are the 1 00 cruzeiros, and take this away!
-1 00 cruzeiros! Great!
-Take this devil away!
No, now it belongs to you
You think that's funny, huh?
You made a good deal
-Hold this piece of junk!
-Hold on...
Hold this
Don't get mad, all right? lsn't it a beauty?
-lt is beautiful, indeed.
-Yes, but you owe me 1 1 0 bucks
-What?
-One hundred and ten!
Are you sad, birdy?
He didn't come
He will come.
Sing, bird. Sing!
-Bread! -l spent all my money on a costume
Chico! Chico!
Oh... lt's you!
-Good morning.
-Good morning. Come in
You're the last thing l expected. l thought it was him
-Him?
-Chico Boto! You don't know him
What a man.
He travels all the time
But he promised to be here for carnival
-Your husband?
-No, why?
We just like each other.
And l'm all his!
You should see what a chest he has lt doesn't mean that l'm not happy to see you!
Actually, since he's not here, it's quite convenient
Let me guess...
You came for carnival!
-l ran away.
-Ran away?
-l'm scared, Serafina!
-You? Scared?
Of what? Of whom?
A man who come to the farm and kept chasing after me
-Because you're beautiful, silly! -No
-l'm sure he wants to kill me.
-Are you crazy, girl?
He just wants to get into your pants, don't you see?
No... he wants to kill me. l know he does l know. Listen and answer me.
Does he know you're here?
-No.
-Then, forget about that! Come
You must be starving. All l have is onions. Do you have money?
Never mind. l'm asking because my costume was expensive
Forget it. The Portuguese grocer will do anything for a kiss
You are really very beautiful!
Good trick
Good morning, Benedito.
How are you?
-ls that amulet for me?
-No, it is for her
-You don't even know her!
-Now l will. Do you want...
-Thank you, Benedito.
-You already know my name?
My name is Eurydice. l'll keep this forever
-Even after l die?
-That's nonsense. Come on
That boy is full of strange ideas. Let's go, come on!
Give me a kiss
-Enough! Only one.
-And you?
-A fish.
-Fish... fish... fish
Something makes me think you came with no money
Exactly! l bring you customers like myself- bold ones
You'll be flexible, won't you?
My pretty little fatso...
One more, please
You are terrible! Always asking for credit, and now this!
No way! Nobody owes me money!
Here! This should hold you for a little while
That's much better.
What about her? lt looks like she's not used to this... poor thing!
-What about you? No kiss?
-No way! l rather pay!
That's too bad, since her man...
This woman is much smarter than you
-Forget it! That's just talk.
-Everybody knows that lf he's really getting married, poor thing! lt's time now.
They are arriving
Take anything you want! ls everybody crazy?
You're not going to see him?
Who?
She doesn't know him yet.
When she does, she'll run even faster than the others.
Are you taking that?
No way, that's green!
Green, green- of course!
Did you want a red chayote?
This can't be! Poor baby!
You're getting hitched?
She's really serious
Do you want me to get rid of your little fiancée? May l?
-How did you do it?
-He insisted l'm so happy!
-You're suffocating me! -l'm happy for you! Give me a hug
-What's going on?
-Oh, it's you! Nothing
Sorry. l must tune the guitar for the rehearsal
-Orpheus! Orpheus!
-Later... later!
-He doesn't want it.
-Didn't l tell you?
-You're an idiot!
-My costume is cool
So beautiful
-Where is Orpheus?
-He left already?
Yes, he said we should meet at the rehearsal
He could at least have told me
You know, he is so shaken, poor thing
Let me see your ring again
-What a beauty! ls it real?
-Almost lt looks great, doesn't it?
Orpheus, will you dance with me?
Yes. Soon, at the rehearsal
How is everybody?
How are you, Caruso?
You two... always cuddling, huh?
-Would you ask him?
-No, you ask him l would like to ask you something ls it true that you make the sun rise by playing guitar?
-Of course l do!
-Didn't l tell you?
Could you make the sun rise tomorrow?
Sure! Even better, since tomorrow is carnival!
What do you play to do that?
-l make it up.
-And you? Could you? l could make up a melody! l'd love to make the sun rise
Give him the guitar.
Just to ckeck it out
This is a very old guitar...
-''Orpheus is my master''.
-Yes, that's true
There was an Orpheus before me.
And one may come after l'm gone but l'm the one ruling now.
Do you understand that?
Don't be sad.
Don't tell anybody, OK? l will play a new song l just wrote
Pretty, isn't it?
Morning, such a pretty morning
A new song is born
Singing of your eyes,
your laughter, your hands
There will be a day
when you come
From the strings of my guitar
That only your love sought
A voice comes
And talks about kisses
Kisses lost in your lips
Sing, my heart,
happiness is back
ln the dawn of this love
-What are you doing here?
-l have the right to...
Zeca, take the guitar!
You didn't see me!
-lsn't he here?
-Who?
Was that you playing?
Orpheus taught me
Where is he?
He just left with a woman
What?
Since you have the guitar, play something
He'll hear me
That's even better. Play
You again? What are you doing here?
Why didn't you tell me that
Serafina is your cousin?
So, we are close.
What's your name?
Don't you remember? l'm Eurydice
Wonderful! l like you already!
Of course! Orpheus likes
Eurydice, as the story goes
Are you Orpheus?
-Yes, l am. From head to toe.
-But l... l don't like you
Yes, you do! Try to remember.
This is really an old story
Thousands of years ago, Orpheus was sad and melancholic like the bird trapped in this cage
One day, from the strings of a guitar, sought by only one love, a voice spoke of lost kisses from the lips of Eurydice
And Eurydice's lips were trembling with anxiety... and the perfumed flower of her mouth opened slightly
No! You are too young to remember
Yes... l remember the words you sang...
-because they are the same!
-Exactly!
But it was the melody l liked best
Forgive me, Eurydice
Look l need to talk to him
No, leave them alone!
Orpheus, they're waiting for you at the rehearsal!
Yes!
Well... l need to go l know l'll sing and dance for you!
-Are you coming?
-Yes, l am
Take good care of her!
Let's go!
See you later
Thanks
Why aren't you paying any attention to me? l have no time now
-Answer me!
-Go back to your place! l'm sorry. He already saw you. He and the sun
Look at Serafina.
She is the Queen of Night
Look how happy she is
-And who is she?
-Her?
That's Mira. She plays the Queen of Day
-She is pretty, isn't she?
-Yes
She is Orpheus' fiancée
Look, he's going to kiss her
-OK, that's enough!
-What's so funny?
-Nothing! That's enough!
-Why didn't you kiss me?
Leave me alone. Have you tried on your costumes?
Of course! Mira's costume is a beauty, isn't it? lt has embroidered sleeves.
Let's go see it
Come and dance, Eurydice, come
Come on!
-And who is that?
-Ask Orpheus!
-l want a costume for her, OK?
-OK, all right
When it comes to women, nobody is better than you!
Leave me alone!
She is pretty! Hot girl
-lsn't she better than Mira?
-Much better! A real beauty!
-She has good taste.
-Drop it!
-So what? So what?
-Where is the costume?
That's all we have. A woman like this doesn't need costumes
-Hold on, let me look next door.
-No
-That's right, you're with Mira.
-Why are you talking about her? lt's nothing... nothing
You don't waste any time, do you?
Shall l introduce my cousin?
Be good now. Take care of her. l want a pretty costume for her
-Oh, you!
-Seriously
You don't even know her!
Yes, l do
Look at me
Look at me!
Oh, boy!
Don't make faces! This is not tragic. l'll take care of it
People, leave the girl alone! l'll take care of her!
-l will help!
-lt's high time!
Don't just stand there!
Move! Go!
Quickly, quickly! l'll take care of her
-Orpheus, is Eurydice here?
-Yes. Why?
-Eurydice, someone's looking for you! -Who?
-A man.
-Who is he? l don't know.
He's not from around here
-Who is it?
-Don't be afraid
Tell him she's left.
She's gone
What are you waiting for?
No!
No!
Calm down. Calm down!
Calm down! There's nothing to be afraid of!
Take care of her!
What happened?
-Eurydice! She got scared!
-Eurydice? -My cousin
-Her name is Eurydice?
-She has the right
Orpheus!
What happened, Benedito? l tried to catch him, but he threw me on the ground
-Where did he go?
-l don't know. That way
That's impossible!
There is a cliff there!
-The man fled that way.
-That way?
What's wrong with him?
-Take care of him.
-Orpheus! What happened?
Who is this Eurydice woman?
Are you sleeping with her?
-No! Let me go!
-Stay here!
No! lf you go...
So, you chased him away?
Eurydice! ls that you? Serafina!
Answer me!
Eurydice!
Where are you? ldiot! You scared me!
You're the one hiding, and l scared you?
-Where is my cousin?
-Your cousin?
-Yes, my cousin!
-Ah, she was your cousin?
-You scared her too, right?
-Who, me?
Fine! l need to find her!
Hold it! l came from
Montevideo to see you!
She'll find her way
-Where is Eurydice?
-He saw her, but she ran off
Where to?
-Answer, man!
-Don't know! That way
He'll find her
Chico!
-Chico, my love!
-You're strangling me!
No!
No! He'll kill you!
He'll kill you!
Take care of her l am not in a hurry
We shall meet soon
So long
You are in my arms, Eurydice l will protect you forever... against everything l like you, Eurydice
You will never feel scared again... never
Chico Boto has arrived.
Do you want to stay here?
Yes
You won't be scared here.
They're great
He will protect you too.
He is a beast!
And then... then there is me
-Let go!
-Orpheus, is that you?
Orpheus! l swear l heard people talking. Didn't you?
-lt was the dog.
-Talking?
No. So what?
Gimme
-She is in good hands.
-Who?
-My cousin.
-Your cousin? Didn't she run off?
Dummy! Open your mouth and close your eyes
More! More!
The dog ripped one of the little animals
They're not animals, they're signs of the zodiac lt's beautiful
That's where l was born. lt's my house in heaven
A baby sheep? l'll rent the one right next to it, so l'll always be near you
Should l?
Good night
Good night l'll sleep outside. lt's closer to my house... and yours
Good night, Eurydice
One... two... three... four... five
-They're playing.
-l hope they will let us sleep
Come!
Come on!
Got you!
You haven't gotten me yet
l can't
l will catch you!
Did l hurt you?
Poor thing!
-ls it still hurting?
-No. lt's better
Wait!
Ah, Chico! l won, didn't l?
You always win
Zeca... Zeca!
Let's go... it's time.
Hurry! Hurry!
All right... l'm coming lt's too early to get up, boy.
Let us sleep in peace!
-Close that door!
-Yes, yes, gramma
Let's go, it's late already
What are these devils doing at this hour?
Quiet, Caruso!
He won't find it.
We better tell him
Yeah, right! Come on, let's see
What if he's asleep? l'll knock on the door
What did l tell you?
My happiness is dreaming
ln the eyes of my girlfriend
lt's like this night, passing
Seeking the dawn
Speak low, please
So she might wake up happy
Look... it's rising
Offering a kiss of love lt's true
Sadness has no end
Happiness does
Happiness is like a drop of dew
On a flower's petal
Brilliant and tranquil,
then quivering
Then falling like a tear of love
Serafina, where is your costume?
Chico is here!
He is always hungry!
-You look beautiful!
-Wait, let me get Orpheus!
No, l'm in a hurry. l will run ahead
Thanks
-Are you getting married today?
-Orpheus forgot
Why? Didn't he invite you?
Eurydice!
Ah, Eurydice
You were here? Quick!
Get your costume on, quick!
No. Quick. No, no... not there, no... that way
-ln a hurry, aren't we?
-Mira... she's coming
So what if she's coming?
Come, dear.
Aren't you ready?
-No... l'm in no hurry.
-ls he out of his mind?
-Orpheus, you promised me.
-l'll keep your scarf
God, he's silly! How did you get him to be like that?
You're awake already!
At least say good morning!
-Who is that?
-My cousin
Your cousin?
Let's not start with that again, OK? Go to sleep!
-l'm hungry.
-Wait!
Eat, eat, eat all the time!
Here, eat and shut up!
God Almighty!
What can l do? l like him lt happens to everybody.
Look at you
Wow! You look great!
What am l going to drink?
Here, but l don't want to see you again
-Nice costume.
-lt was Orpheus' idea
-Happy you.
-Me?
Carnival is very nice, child, but tomorrow Chico leaves again
Here, button this down
-l'd rather fool around with him.
-l'd rather dance with Orpheus
Orpheus, open the door! lncredible!
What if you were to dance in my place?
-No!
-Yes! That's it!
-Orpheus, open the door!
-l'm coming, l'm coming
What are you doing?
Can't you see? Look
Am l pretty?
-Yes.
-What's the matter?
You could at least look
Do you have a sore throat?
-Are you...
-Listen, Mira, l need to
New? Must be... What are these animals on the scarf?
They are not animals.
They are zodiac signs
Zodiac signs! You don't say!
And the girl next door took you to heaven last night, right?
Answer me!
Here! That's what l think of this bitch's dirty rag lt's her, isn't it?
-Shut up!
-You're afraid she will hear!
Listen, if l see her again with you, l will kill her!
We came to help you take the sun l will wait for you outside
Here. My tambourine
You look very pretty, you know?
Who was screaming next door?
-Nobody.
-Was that Mira?
-Since you already know...
-Orpheus told me everything
-He promised to talk to her.
-l understand
-Aren't you coming, Serafina?
-Yes, l'm coming!
She is going to be mad
-Quick, put your veil down.
-Now?
Now! Otherwise Mira will think l've been playing tricks on her
She is no good l'm coming! Chico, wake up and give my cousin a kiss, quick!
-Your cousin?
-Yes!
-That's her!
-You win the smart prize!
Now she is me, and you will kiss her as if she were me, OK?
-Kiss her?
-Yes, her!
No, not here. At the door! l'm coming! Soon! Soon!
Kiss her! Hard!
Enough!
Say something to her!
-Like what?
-What? How, what?
What... what... what
But l don't know your cousin!
-Look at Serafina's costume.
-Too much veil, not enough face!
For Serafina, that's an advantage, trust me!
Orpheus, are you going to stand there forever? Let's go!
Ask Serafina if Eurydice is coming. Run!
Serafina, Orpheus wants to know if Eurydice is coming
Why do you have her amulet?
-ls it a secret?
-Yes. Only Orpheus may know it l'll run and tell him to wait for you
Attention! Attention!
Here comes the best...

Eurydice!
Watch out!
Catch it, Benedito!
Attention! The presence of
Orpheus, representative...
of United Babylon is
required at the Jury's stand!
Why did you choose Serafina to dance in my place?
Not now. The Jury is calling me! Come, Lourdes!

Thank you, thanks... everybody deserves... look, look l will kill you!
No!

-She was sent to the morgue
No, she is alive! l'm going to find her! lt's true, Orpheus. Wait!
-May l go?
-Yes
Wait , Orpheus! Orpheus!
-They are all like that at first.
-No!
They really liked each other
Really... does that exist? lt does
Orpheus, wait for me! l'd like some information
Are you family? Then you can't stay here lt is forbidden.
You can't come in
Stop, stop!
You can't go up!
Go, go- Go away! lt went up
Stop!
What do you want?
What are you doing here?
-Nothing.
-Then, please leave lt's forbidden and we have no time to waste
Don't be sad, Orpheus lt's over... lt's all over
Hold this bitch!
-l know him.
-l know this guy
-Are you Orpheus, from Babylon?
-Yes, l am
He is incredible!
The best! Great singer!
Sing something for us! The one you sang for us... how was it?
Sing, man!
What's your problem?
-l'm looking for a lost person.
-That's not here
These are soccer fans.
Missing Persons, 1 2th floor
-Where is that?
-l'll show you. Come here
Show me that step
That thing... that one.
Something like that
OK, go... get out of here
Get out of here!
Go away!
Anybody there?
What are you looking for, brother?
Missing Persons
There is such a section... but l never saw any missing people there. Just paper
That's Missing Persons
See? Nobody there... but lots of paper, see?
The house is full.
1 5 floors of paper... for nothing
Can you read?
-Yes.
-l can't
Feel free to look around, if you wish... but you will not find missing people in papers
On the contrary, that's where they get lost
Are you suffering, my brother? l lost Eurydice lt's as if she were burning inside my heart
Keep calling... She will come l am calling
You alone... that's not strong enough... and these papers will not give you an answer
Do you think paper cares for anybody?
Let's go, my brother. l know where to take you
Let's go
Sweeping, or not sweeping, there is always more paper
Come, Orpheus
Quiet! Calm down,
Cerberus... calm down
Calm down, Cerberus
That's how it goes.
She received the spirit
Call her...
Sing, Orpheus!
Sing, Orpheus... go ahead!
Sing, Orpheus!
Orpheus, Orpheus
Eurydice!
Eurydice!
Don't look back, Orpheus.
You will never see me again
Where are you, Eurydice?
l'm close to you, Orpheus
Do you love me enough to accept
hearing me without seeing me? l love you, Eurydice, but l want to see you! My arms are empty! l want to see you, to hold you close to me
No! You will lose me, Orpheus
You are not there.
You are tricking me!
No! l want to see you!
Orpheus, you're killing me!
Farewell, Orpheus.
You'll never see me again
No! You lied to me!
Why did you do that to me?
-You lied to me.
-Calm down, Orpheus. Don't leave!
Hermes, that's him. lt is him! lt's me. Hermes also came l've nothing left in life l am poorer than the poorest of the black men
Seek mercy, my son.
We are all poor and... what's left to be said is the poor people's word- thanks l ask you for mercy, Hermes
All l can do is give you mercy
Here. l have already done everything that had to be done l think that you'll get true mercy there
Thank you, Hermes
No, my son. You are going to thank Eurydice
Yes
Are you going to take her yourself?
All right.
Come with me lf you don't want it, it's always interesting... having another cadaver for the doctors, for science
And it is also cheaper for you lt is my duty to ask that question, because of them... and, the truth is, when one is here...
Carnival is over, there is nothing one can do
Would you like to try and identify her?
Careful, you'll get a cold dressed like that
Death is cheap here, right?
Careful! You're shaking
The same thing happens to me
lt doesn't help to be careful.
l have a cold all year round
Everything is beautiful, Eurydice
My heart is a bird whose thirst is quenched by a drop of dew
Thank you, Eurydice.
Thank you for this new day
You are the one who carries me l am in your arms, like a sleeping child
The sweet breath of your chest l know you will take me where l must go
Thank you, Eurydice. The path you chose is full of flowers
The sun is rising to embrace us, my love
You are singing, Eurydice
The happiness of the poor is
the great illusion of carnival
We work all year long
Mira!
No! No! No!
Zeca!
Hurry! Hurry!
-Play and make the sun rise!
-l don't know how!
-Sure, you know.
-l don't know if l can!
Make it up!
-Come on, play!
-l don't know
You do know, come on!
He plays well, doesn't he?
What are you looking at?
Shut up!
He is making the sun rise!
He made the sun rise!
Wow! Just like Orpheus!
-Now you are Orpheus.
-No
Yes. Take this little flower
Play a song for me, please
Come on!

Observatories dedicated to the study of astronomy often are set in high and remote places.
But there is none more remote than Mount Kenna Observatory in this part of South Africa.
If our calculations prove to be correct this will be the most frightening discovery of all time.
These two bodies have travelled almost a million miles in two weeks.
- Is that Randall?
- I hope so.
Stanley, I want Randall to leave as quickly as possible.
The plates are ready, catalogued and marked for identification.
- Here are tonight's plates.
- Good! lnclude them.
I told Professor Hendron
I'd send as much detail as we have.
Paul, Stanley, it won't be necessary to tell Randall what he's carrying.
ZS, MAP, Dave Randall from Johannesburg.
Cabin monoplane, request permission to land. Over.
Hello, Randall. This is Russ Curtis,
Mount Kenna Field.
Visibility fine. Take runway three.
Approach from southwest at 500.
There's a car waiting to take you to the observatory. Over...over.
Thank you, Mount Kenna Field!
- Hello, Randall.
- How are you, Stan?
You must have been held up.
We knew you arrived two hours ago.
I had a friend's aunt for a passenger to get home.
- I'm Emery Bronson.
- Hello, doctor.
- You've been well recommended.
- It shouldn't have taken much.
I understand all you want is a package delivered.
Did you bring your passport to the United States?
Yes. But who gets delivery of what?
Your recommendation said I could depend on a lack of curiosity.
I don't care what you're doing.
Just tell me where do I go
- and when I get paid.
- I didn't mean to be rude.
It's just that secrecy is very important now.
Fly to Lisbon, then take the transatlantic clipper to New York.
The delivery will be made to Dr Hendron at the Cosmos Observatory.
Here are several poses of Dr Hendron.
The delivery must be made to him personally.
- To Dr Hendron only.
- Right.
You'll require this for expenses.
I'm supposed to get $1,500 plus expenses.
Hendron will pay on delivery.
Time is all that counts.
The money doesn't matter at all.
With me, doctor, money always matters.
Perhaps now.
But the day may arrive when money won't mean anything.
Not to you, nor anyone.
When that happens to me,
I'll be six feet under.
Good luck, Randall.
There was another radiogram for you at the last stop.
Thank you.
- I hope you're enjoying your trip.
- It's very nice, thanks.
Honestly, the inspection takes longer than the trip across.
I brought Clara a few things.
She's so appreciative.
50% duty?
I'd rather junk the stuff right here.
I think that's the man, carrying the black box.
I'll see.
- David Randall?
- That's right.
May I see your passport, please?
Thank you.
Fine.
I'll handle this, Jim.
Give him his luggage.
That brown one over there.
Right this way, please.
- Here's your man.
- How do you do?
I'm Joyce Hendron,
Professor Hendron's daughter.
We're to go straight to the observatory.
This is better than a motorcycle escort.
You'll need a pass to get out of the building. The pass.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Right this way, Mr Randall.
Mr Randall. Mr Randall!
Mr Randall, I'm Donovan from "The Sentinel".
- Some other time.
- We've raised our offer. $7,500.
Here's a cheque to your order.
No thanks.
I'm working on a better offer.
I can't imagine how "The Sentinel" even had a hint about your errand.
But it's difficult to keep secrets from the newspapers.
I'm glad you turned them down.
You know what it would mean if the public had this information prematurely?
Of course.
We've been praying Dr Bronson is wrong - that these pictures will show some error in his calculations.
Don't you find yourself wishing...
Wouldn't you rather not know?.
No, it's better to know.
I wish I had your courage.
But I'm frightened.
As frightened as all those people would be if they knew.
I haven't the courage to face the end of the world.
Joyce!
- I'm glad you waited for me.
- So am I.
Tony, this is Mr Randall.
- How are you?
- How do you do?
Alice, didn't my father know
Dr Drake was here?
I told Alice not to bother him.
He's in a meeting of the observatory trustees.
They'll want to see you right away.
- You smoke?
- Thanks, I'll try one.
Have a South African one.
You part of this deal, doctor?
This stargazing?
No, I confine my gazing to the eye, ear, nose and throat.
I'm an MD.
I gather you're not an astronomer either.
I'm just a high-priced messenger boy who's beginning to doubt the sanity of astronomers.
They should stick to wrong weather predictions.
Astronomy is a very exact science.
But when they say Doomsday is around the corner, we part company.
Who's been telling you that?
Mr Randall, come right this way.
Hello, Tony, come along if you want to.
- Please...
- One second.
I have people waiting.
- I'm supposed to make sure.
- Yes, of course.
They check.
Who told you that, about Doomsday?
Why doc, I thought you were practically family.
Put it on the desk, Randall, please.
Thank you, dear.
Dr Bronson said I would get $1,500...
- I'll take care of it.
- But this is supposed to be COD.
Hold still, please.
Oh, thank you.
Would you mind waiting in the anteroom?
He knows all the details, Dad.
Dr Bronson and I have no secrets.
Has Bronson been at this study long?
Two years. But I first heard from him ten days ago...
He wanted me to check his findings.
Give this data to DA.
D for differential. A for analyser.
Differential analyser - DA.
Naturally.
We'll check these through the viewer.
- Dr Hendron, the key.
- Later, Randall, later...
Sometimes I wish I didn't know
Bronson's capabilities so well.
He rarely leaves any margin for error.
This was Bronson's first discovery.
Bellus, a star, a dozen times larger than earth, has been approaching earth at tremendous speed.
Bronson's second discovery - a new planet.
Bronson named it Zyra and his measurements show it revolves around Bellus more rapidly than earth revolves around the sun.
This is in the constellation of Scorpio.
Dr Frye, notice the position of these new bodies.
Yes, I see.
But here again, Bellus and Zyra have changed position.
Just how fast they've been moving and their eventual destination are among the mathematical problems being determined by our differential analyser.
We'll have the results in a few hours.
Zyra is about the same size as our earth.
Both these bodies are coming into our solar system.
If Bronson's readings are correct, they will destroy the earth.
How far away are they?
The calculator will be precise.
I estimate 3 billion miles.
Billion? Let people start worrying in a hundred years.
You've flown ships faster than sound.
These bodies are thousands of times faster and could be here within one year.
All this depends on Bronson being correct.
The planet Zyra will pass close enough to influence the tides.
Oceans will be torn from their depths.
Tidal waves will sweep in from the coasts.
There will be giant earthquakes.
Handfuls of people may survive if provisions are made.
We'll make them.
Every possible effort.
Whatever help my factories can give, we'll give gladly.
It will be useless. Soon after,
Bellus will collide with the earth.
Our world will end.
There is no error.
I always wanted to do this.
Want to try?
It's funny. I keep thinking about a Mr Simmons.
He was a patient of mine when I was interning.
One of those incurable cases.
I used to wonder how he felt the day he asked me how much longer he had to live.
Now I think I know.
- Joyce?
- Yes?
Let's not put off getting married.
There isn't any reason to wait, is there?
I promised Dad I'd wait.
There'll be so much to do.
Your father will be the first to agree.
The time that's left should be ours.
We're entitled to be selfish when we know what's coming.
I'd feel better if I talked to Dad first.
He'll be home the day after tomorrow.
- Dr Drake?
- Yes?
There is a call for you from the hospital.
Thank you.
Excuse me, I'll be right back.
I never used to believe my mother's stories about Americans being the most progressive people.
I thought she was boasting because she was born here.
But this is proof of progress.
They charge for drinks...by the inch.
Look, stargazer, arithmetic is your department.
How much is seven times $2.50?
Real progress, $17.50 per bottle.
- Tell me something, stargazer.
- What is it?
You and the doctor going to get married?
I don't know.
Maybe you could tell me where I could find out.
Why?
I'd like to stop being an interested bystander.
Bronson gets in tomorrow.
I'll tell him he was right to say the day was coming when money wouldn't mean a thing to me.
May I trouble you for another light?
Thank you, Madam.
This is the day. Money to burn!
I must ask one question that all the delegates want answered.
I hope I have your confidence.
You are satisfied there is no error and that all the facts are correct?
Yes, sir.
The effect of Zyra's passing should be felt about one o'clock on the afternoon of July 24th.
What about the giant star, Bellus?
Can the doctor tell us when this second body will threaten?
19 days later.
Bellus will crush the earth on the morning of August 12th.
This is not a publicity seeking campaign.
We are aware that most of our colleagues ridicule our findings.
But believing what we do, we have to ask for this hearing.
Therefore, I ask you, Dr Hendron, if it is with complete certainty that you say the world will end next August 12th?
Precisely that, sir.
There is a very remote possibility, that a few people may be saved.
The world will be destroyed, but a few people will be saved?
Our world will end on August 12th, in eight months.
There is no margin for error in that.
But we believe that Zyra once contained living matter.
We believe, and this is theory not certainty, that some form of vegetation may exist on Zyra.
You are proposing that we all pack our trunks and move to...Zyra?
No, but we hope that with God's guidance, a few may do exactly that.
A 20th century Noah's ark.
As many as can be built in this short time.
Eventually, as Zyra and Bellus speed toward us, even a layman will see the danger.
As a train looms in the distance, in an instant it is upon you.
With enough funds, labour and material,
Dr Frye believes rockets can be built to fly to Zyra.
But eight months is very little time.
Only if work begins immediately can this be done.
If you wait until the danger is visible, it will be too late.
Bellus and Zyra will be upon us and crush the earth!
Dr Ottinger, of the Estabrook Observatory.
Gentlemen, my colleagues,
Dr Felix Zenta,
Professor of astronomy at Cornwall
University and Dr Jonathan Wilson,
President of the International
Planetary Research Institute, and I have examined the photographs and data submitted by Drs Hendron and Bronson.
Our findings show there is no cause for alarm.
No reason to spend billions of dollars to build spaceships which never will be needed.
Suppose they were built.
Do either of you believe spaceships can fly to any planet?
It is theoretically possible.
I believe in theories. But when you say flying to another planet is possible you are out of the realm of theory and dreaming of the impossible.
Even if the world were to end, would it be less unpleasant to die in space than here, on firm ground?
The world will not end.
Certainly, these new bodies will pass our planet.
Heavenly bodies frequently do.
But we are still here.
Predicting the end of the world is an annual crackpot event in our society.
An attempt to corner the newspaper headlines.
But I did not expect a man of Dr Hendron's background to join this headline-hunting parade.
Read all about it!
End of the world just around the corner.
Read all about it!
Let's be thankful for small favours.
The subcommittee didn't believe us.
At least they didn't ridicule us.
No one believes us.
How will we interest enough private capital?
I'll buy you a start on your ship!
I'll settle for the satisfaction that I contributed to salvaging something from our old world.
I'm older and richer than you are.
I'll arrange the lease on a large camp - an old government site.
Between us, you'll have enough to start.
Wonderful, Spiro!
I'll arrange the details for our next meeting.
Gentlemen.
- Have you got a minute, Dad?
- I'm marking time.
We have an appointment with Sydney Stanton.
Will he give you the money you need?
I hope so.
He made the appointment.
Tony's outside.
- I'm sure he didn't come to see me.
- He wants to marry me, now.
I don't blame him.
Isn't marriage what you want?
I've liked Tony more than any other man.
I was always sure we would get married one of these days.
There isn't time for uncertainty.
You have to answer this question.
Do you want to spend what time is left as Tony's wife?
I wish I could answer.
I suppose it really doesn't matter... and it is what Tony wants.
- Not what you want?
- I don't know that either.
Dad, I'm so mixed up.
I can't think straight.
Do I know this subject of your confusion?
Dave Randall.
I don't know why, when or where.
I told myself I like being with him only because he's someone different.
- Yes?
- Mr Stanton is here.
Tell Dr Frye and send in Mr Stanton.
You told me to answer the question.
Let Tony wait a while longer.
And give me two minutes after Stanton leaves to figure out an excuse to keep Dave Randall right here.
Oh, thanks, Dad! Thanks!
- Dr Hendron.
- Mr Stanton.
- This is Dr Frye.
- Doctor of what?
Dr Frye is the dean of the Eastern School of Technology.
All right, I'm here safe and sound.
Go outside and read the magazines!
Will this Noah's ark get to that new planet?
In theory. On some engineers' calculations it is possible.
Your observatory trustees,
Marston and Spiro, tell me you have an equipped camp but need money to finish the ship.
- Millions!
- Amounts don't stagger me.
I'm just weighing the percentages.
Your word against other astronomers.
Wilson, Ottinger, Zenta.
- They think you're a crackpot.
- I know.
- It will mean liquidating some interests.
- It may save a civilisation!
Their salvation doesn't interest me.
Mine does!
I'm no humanitarian like Marston and Spiro. I just don't relish dying.
What are the chances of existence on this new planet?
We don't know.
We can only hope they're good.
- Millions for theories!
- The end of the world is no theory to us.
If I thought it was, I wouldn't be here.
All right. I'll pay for your ark.
- But I select who goes with us.
- This won't be a commercial liner.
There may be space for 40 human beings, some machinery and livestock.
The minimum for a new life.
You're not qualified to select those people.
I reserve that privilege.
Make up your mind.
You admit you don't relish dying.
You're willing to put up the money as life insurance, that if the world ends, you'll be among the few to reach this new world.
That makes my proposition simple.
Your money for your life.
We'll do the picking together.
Half and half.
Why not? Why should you be the one to give life or take it away?
The proposition still stands.
Your money or your life.
You know I can't refuse. Build it.
You are the men selected.
Gentlemen, this is a rough design of our ship.
Instead of taking off in a customary manner, straight up, we will conserve fuel by using a mile-long slide to give us impetus.
The ship will be cradled on a rocket-propelled undercarriage which will be automatically released.
At this point, the wing engines will be turned on.
The power of all engines will be used to carry us out of earth's gravitational pull.
We will then be in free ascent, until we reach the gravitational pull of Zyra, when the ship will be operated as a normal aircraft.
Similar rocket ships are also being constructed in other countries.
Now about our camp and its working conditions.
Dave Randall, who is assisting
Dr Hendron, will talk to you about that.
Thanks, Dr Frye.
First, you were selected because you are the top engineering students here.
Agricultural students and mechanics, all were picked in this way.
The project needs you because you are fine technicians who are healthy and free to make your own decision.
There is no guarantee that the ship will reach Zyra.
But those to make the flight will be chosen by lots, sometime before the worlds collide.
Only about 40 persons can be taken and already more than 600 people are working on this project.
Go down to the bunker first.
Joyce Hendron, please.
Take your new arrivals to dormitory C.
- Got the cards for this group?
- Yes, sir.
- Are my cards ready?
- Right here, Miss Hendron.
All right, fellas, this way.
Thanks. I'll leave these at the clinic.
Follow me, girls.
Dr Frye, please, Dr Frye.
There is a call for you from the microfilm laboratory.
Julie!
See you later.
Check in at the medical clinic within 30 minutes.
Attention, new arrivals.
Check in at the medical clinic within 30 minutes.
Dr Bronson, please, go to the chart room.
Attention, main garage.
Two jeeps are needed immediately at the foot of the ramp approach.
Animals now waiting for unloading on east end siding.
- Hello, Tony.
- Joyce!
- Did you have a nice trip?
- 17 new people. Where's Dad?
Dr Ottinger asked me to come to New York for a conference with Wilson and Zenta.
I'll put these new cards in the file.
- Is this the new design?
- That's right.
The drawings came while you were away.
Bronson tells me Ottinger and the other doubting Thomases have jumped over to our side of the fence.
That will end the newspapers calling me a lunatic.
Stanton's folly!
With time running out, they'll wish they had a fleet of Stanton's follies.
They admit our calculations are correct but insist our flight is impossible.
Even in other countries where ships are being built, most say it isn't possible.
- And you?
- I believe as I did before. In theory...
Always theories.
Jigsaw puzzles on paper.
- Aren't you ever positive?
- Only about Doomsday.
A government representative will warn people tomorrow.
They will be evacuated to mountain locations.
What provisions have you made to protect us when the panic starts?
- I haven't thought about it.
- I have.
I don't deal in theories.
I deal in realities.
Ferris! Bring in those boxes.
I brought enough rifles to stop a small army.
- There'll be no panic.
- Stop theorising.
Once the havoc is over, every mother's son will try to climb aboard our ship.
People know only a handful can make the flight.
You've spent too much time with the stars.
You don't know about the law of the human jungle. I've spent my life at it.
You don't know what your civilised people will do to cling to life.
I do, because I'd cling if I had to kill to do it. And so will you.
We're the lucky ones with a chance to reach another world.
And we'll use those guns to keep your only chance to stay alive.
Ferris! Ferris!
There's no question that crisis impends.
The secretary is on his way.
We will have his message in a moment.
My friends, it is imperative that you listen closely.
This is a matter of life or death.
Your lives and those of everyone on earth.
At one o'clock on July 24th,
Zyra, a new planet, will pass so close to the Earth, it will cause mass destruction.
There is no doubt about the coming of Zyra.
Remember, there is no doubt.
By one o'clock on that day, whole populations must have been evacuated from coastal areas.
Plans have been made and all that can be done will be done.
When I was a kid, I read a book about the world ending.
I was so scared, I didn't dare sleep.
Then in the morning, the sun came out, everything looked so wonderful,
I forgot the story.
Life was beautiful all over again.
The same sun will be shining on the new world.
Look, stargazer,
I don't figure in this new world.
The past couple of months, you and I have been telling recruits the few to make the trip will be needed in the new world.
Scientists like you or your father,
Tony, farmers and mechanics.
You'll have things to offer.
But you won't be needing aerial taxi drivers for another hundred years.
Dad promised me that...
Dad said we'd need you.
Thanks, but Noah would have turned down my application fast.
I'm not applying for this trip.
Use a little arithmetic.
The ship's cargo is limited.
Every pound will count.
I weigh as much as a couple of lambs, three dozen chickens, one healthy farmer.
We're coming in.
Better see that they're strapped down.
Randall, calling Plateau Tower.
Come in, please, over.
Schedules of train, bus and plane departures will be made available in all countries.
Attention, please.
The commanding general will speak to you. Stand by.
This is an official order.
The evacuation will now proceed in an orderly manner.
There will be planes enough for all.
Women and children will go first.
Families will not be separated for long.
I repeat this.
Families will only be separated for the duration of the evacuation flight.
Women and children will now proceed to the designated planes.
Never before in the history of the world has humanity felt so close to God.
As Zyra inexorably rushes toward us perhaps to destroy the earth, men and women of all races and creeds pause to think, to pray and to atone.
As evacuation of coastal cities progressed, tales of acts of heroism and sacrifice poured into newspaper offices.
With few exceptions, transportation and utility workers volunteered to remain at their posts until the evacuation is completed.
Overnight, populations of inland cities were more than doubled.
Deserted, the once great city of New York is a ghost town.
Ten million mighty roaring machines suddenly shut off, waiting for the approach of Zyra.
The silence, an eerie foretelling of the destruction to come at one o'clock, the hour of doom!
According to your figures, by now we were supposed to feel the effects of Zyra's passing.
Tidal waves, oceans torn from their beds...
Millions of dollars for a false alarm.
Ottinger called you a crackpot.
All you scientists are crackpots.
Nothing is going to happen.
Ferris!
- Are you all right?
- Yes, Dad. I'm over here.
Attention! The ship is breaking loose. Emergency crews to ramp!
Move those l-beams to the ship!
Come on!
Go to the crane and use the hook to stop the undercarriage.
Lower the block!
Look out! The crane is falling.
Bronson!
This is Emergency Camp 9 again.
Is anyone left?
Can anyone hear us?
We are located 11 miles due north of Middletown.
That's about 100 miles from here.
There is desperate need here for drinking water...
Anything else for the helicopter, doctor?
Those boxes. I'll bring the rest.
Repeating - we are remaining on the air.
Can anyone hear us?
We need drinking water and medical supplies - plasma and penicillin.
You needn't come, Randall.
I can fly a helicopter.
- I've done a lot of parcel dropping.
- I can handle it.
Sounds like somebody rubbed you the wrong way.
That's an excellent diagnosis.
Would you like to prescribe a cure?
You're the doctor, you name it.
Now or later?
We need drinking water and medical supplies desperately - plasma and penicillin.
Later. Come on.
Can anyone help?
Can anyone hear us?
What's that?
For a minute, I thought maybe now was that later you mentioned.
I gave it a passing thought.
We cannot postpone the inevitable.
This meeting is to choose those to make the attempt to reach Zyra.
As you know, human cargo must be restricted to 7,000 lbs, 44 persons.
Every pound consumes fuel, which we cannot waste if we are to have any chance.
About 900 lbs already have been spoken for -
Mr Stanton, Dr Frye, my daughter, myself, Dr Drake and Mr Randall.
Unless there is some objection we intend to include another 40 lbs, our latest addition to the camp.
To again emphasise our fuel problem, most of it will be consumed in overcoming earth's gravitational pull.
Once this has been accomplished, engines will be turned off until we come into the gravitational pull of the new world.
In turning the ship completely around every ounce of fuel will be needed to avoid crashing.
Dr Frye and I hope we have worked out a sound plan.
It would be unwise for a man to know he is not to go while a man working at his side is among the fortunate few.
In this envelope is a list of numbers of those who will go.
In these boxes we have placed numbered discs.
The one on the left for the women, the other for the men.
Each of you will select and keep one disc.
This list will be posted on the dormitory bulletin boards shortly before the take off.
Is this plan satisfactory?
If there are no objections, please start the drawing.
This is the men's box.
Your box is here.
You pick both numbers.
This is the women's box.
You're already listed.
Hello, Dave.
I've been looking for you.
Not to quarrel about your sense of ethics - just to ask why?
I haven't any more right than any other man in this camp.
I'll grant you that.
I'll even admit my motive was selfish.
I want to do things according to Hoyle.
But Joyce is pretty important to me.
- And to me.
- I'm glad.
I'd do anything to ensure her chances.
Wouldn't you?
It isn't a free ride for Joyce.
She's qualified to go.
No more than some others.
We're stretching the point because she's important to both of us.
Why not for her sake, stretch the point further to include you?
Look, doctor. I've wrestled with this thing for weeks.
I can give you a dozen reasons why I shouldn't go.
Give me one good reason to include me.
She wants you, Dave.
That'll change. Tony will be there.
She's used to having him around.
They would have been married if I hadn't come into the picture.
Anyhow, why worry?
Maybe I drew a lucky number.
You didn't take any number from that box.
I had the exact number of discs in it.
One for every man and woman except the six people I named.
If you had taken a number, we would have been one short.
Look, doctor. The drawing is over.
You can't issue new numbers without starting a revolution among the lucky winners.
It's about time I donated something to this setup.
I won't be needed. I never have been.
I didn't give up much by not drawing.
What's one chance in 600?
Leaving me will save fuel.
Let it stay that way.
And I hope you won't say anything to Joyce.
Good night.
Attention, everyone!
Bellus growing larger.
Getting closer every hour.
And with every hour the time left gets shorter. So hurry!
More welders are needed by Construction Crew 3.
Please rush!
Seven days left.
We're falling behind schedule.
Trucks are waiting to load plasma and medical supplies. Hurry!
Less than six days left.
We're still behind schedule.
Construction Crew 5, report to the main bunker.
This engine's all right.
Let's try this one.
I'll take it.
It will work out all right, Joyce.
Please.
Only 79 hours to the collision with Bellus.
We're still more than three hours behind schedule. Hurry!
- Worried?
- No.
This ship is really well put together.
If anything can make it to the new world, this one will do it.
- Dave?
- Yeah?
How long would it take to learn this flight panel board?
A few weeks, maybe.
But Dr Frye knows every knob on the panel.
He can operate it in his sleep.
I hope so.
What'll happen when he blacks out?
Everyone will black out in the fast climb.
The direction will be set.
This will hold you on course.
- All the way to Zyra?
- No, but far enough.
The blackout won't last too long...a few minutes, tops.
This is no time to start doubting the ship, doc.
I'm not. I know how well it's been put together.
The trouble is I just learned how Dr Frye's put together.
His chance of coming out of the blackout isn't good.
- I've seen older men make it.
- At the speed we'll climb?
1,500 miles in a few minutes?
His heart won't stand that pressure.
When did you discover that?
Yesterday. When I made his cardiograph test.
I haven't told anyone yet - not even Frye.
Well, don't!
It won't help to scare everyone.
Like Doomsday, that can't be avoided.
We can't let Frye handle this flight.
Look, doc... maybe...well...
Dr Hendron and Frye must be told.
I can't take that responsibility.
That isn't what I wanted to say.
No...you're right.
You'll have to tell them, I guess.
There's no other choice.
If anything happens to Frye after we get out into space...
I don't suppose it makes any difference, crashing from 1,500 miles up, or dying on earth.
Either way, you're just plain dead.
After the blackout, one of the technology students,
Eddie Cummings could take over, if Frye tells him what to do.
If Frye is able to tell him after the blackout.
Dave, you're hedging!
We both know who can handle this flight.
Maybe not as good as Frye, but good enough.
Do you doubt being able to fly this ship?
I can fly her.
There isn't anyone else.
You're our life insurance.
If Frye doesn't make it, you can land the ship.
For months, I've tried to find a legitimate reason to go.
I never could. Maybe things were meant to happen this way.
Diagnose it any way you want.
All I know is, I'd feel a lot easier, not having to tell Frye the news.
Be right back!
This is the last of the chloroform.
Put it somewhere handy to the animal pens.
You going to give the animals a mickey finn?
If we don't, the pressure will drive them mad.
We wouldn't want to see them kick the ship apart.
I'll never forget what you did for Dave and me, Tony.
I told you the doctor would fix everything.
Come here, Whatsis.
- Come on.
- Where are you from, boy?
- He's mine.
- Where did you get him, Mike?
- Downtown.
- You mean down at the airfield?
He was walking around.
I hate to remind you, but you said the doctor can fix everything.
That's right, I did, didn't I?
Let's weigh him.
Incidentally, he's a she.
Nine lbs, two ounces.
Sure, Whatsis is gonna pinch it for a couple of plump chickens.
Urgent! We are still
32 minutes behind schedule.
Those making the attempt to reach Zyra, report without delay to Dr Drake.
- I knew it would be like this!
- What did you expect?
My number - it's on! I'm on the list!
Julie! I'm on the list!
Julie! My number!
I'm on the list!
Remember, if we delay the take off as long as possible,
Zyra's position will form a perfect orbit with ours.
I hope we can retain that extra fuel to keep us flying over Zyra, while we look for landing room.
Zyra will be about here in relation to earth.
If you hold the ship to this curve, we can meet her orbit and run parallel.
The fuel will last longer with less cargo!
Why risk taking so many people?
You and that chair weigh 186 lbs.
That's a lot of fuel.
Do you want to donate that weight?
No more than you want to donate your life!
Or your daughter's.
I paid for this ship. You would have been wiped out with the rest of the world!
Before you paid, you tried to make this a personal enterprise.
A private rocket ship for your own special use.
This project was started by real humanitarians. By Marston and Spiro.
They gave their money with no strings attached.
You're not here under any special licence.
You're always shouting for facts.
Remember these facts.
Our chance of reaching the new world is as thin as you becoming a humanitarian!
If we make it, will we be able to land?
Will the air be fit to breathe?
Will there be water? Vegetable life?
Men and women here have been praying for God's help.
Not your kind of hypocritical praying, but the kind that comes from deep inside a man.
- Sorry. I'll come back later.
- No. We can't put things off till later.
I just wanted to leave this for someone else to use.
He has a girl, Julie Cummings.
I guess he doesn't want to leave her.
There's that extra fuel.
He must weigh close to 180.
You heard him volunteer to stay behind.
Shut the door.
You're not taking it from him!
He turned it back of his own free will.
Get out. Ferris!
The other side of the door for you.
Shut up!
This is one of the good ones, isn't it?
I'm sorry.
The people have all been selected.
- I'm going too.
- Put that gun down.
I'd almost rather kill you than go along.
For seven years, ever since I started pushing this chair around,
I've hated your insides.
You're a very easy man to hate.
I'd like to reason things out.
You see...
No! You three are running things.
You'll tell everybody I'm going!
This is my number.
That's all the reasoning I want to know.
And if I don't go...
- He was going to kill us.
- Better give it to me.
I said this would happen.
And not just Ferris!
There'll be others. All of them.
They won't wait to die here.
- He may be right.
- There's a lot of bad feeling.
One boy was stabbed after the list was posted. There've been fist fights.
It's dog eat dog.
The law of the jungle.
We can't risk it.
What do we do now?.
Move the women on board and lock the gates.
The men can wait outside until take off!
- The guns are in my room.
- That's out!
We'll have to move people and animals as quietly as possible.
- There's a girl...
- Julie Cummings.
Tell her there's been a mix-up.
She and Eddie Garson are going.
We'll gamble on less flying time over the new world.
- Let me tell you...
- Don't say it Stanton!
Don't say anything.
The last dawn!
I think we can start boarding.
All right, everyone, inside the ship!
I'll bring Mr Stanton.
Why should our lives be decided by a raffle?
How do we know it wasn't fixed?
- It should have been by voting!
- Let's take the ship!
Gangway, boys.
- Here are the guns Stanton left.
- That's all we need!
- Let's go. Grab a gun.
- There's no sense in this.
- We agreed to the drawing.
- Listen to him.
Take the ship. Then what?
Only 40 can get away.
The rest of us will get rid of that 40, and the next 40 until we kill each other or get caught when the worlds collide!
Stick around until the collision puts you out of your misery.
Get me on board.
You were right. You're a better judge of people than I am.
Get me aboard. No, Hendron.
What are you doing? Stop him!
Hendron, what are you doing?
No. Wait. Help!
Dr Hendron.
Get on board, hurry.
Hold the gangplank.
Hold the ramp, wait!
We're the extra fuel they might need.
The new world isn't for us.
It's for the young.
Dave! The ship is moving. Stand by.
We're out of the pressure zone.
The engines are off.
We're on course.
You invented those cardiographs for my benefit.
Yours and Joyce's.
- How does it look?
- Better than we expected.
We'll need every bit, or we'll hit the new world head-on, at ten miles a second.
- We're getting close.
- In a minute we'll feel the pull.
Turn the ship.
Start all engines.
We're slowing.
- Can I cut one engine?
- Not yet. Keep them all going.
- We're using fuel too fast.
- We have no choice.
The ship has turned for landing.
Take over.
Cut wing engines one and six.
I'm going to level off.
Brace yourselves.
We're levelling the ship.
Land anywhere! We've got to.
- Not yet.
- Check your belts.
The fuel's gone.
There's an opening!
- There go the engines!
- I'll bring it around and glide in.
- It looks frozen!
- I hope so!
We're going to find out.
- We made it!
- We're here!
- We're on Zyra.
- Let's get out!
Dave, wait until we've tested the atmosphere.
We'll get a sample through the airlock.
Never mind. Good air or bad, it's the only place we can go!
Best air I ever tasted.
Break out the gangplank.
Mike! Where is he?
Hey, Mike!
Don't you want to see the sunrise?
- Our first citizens.
- And they're all mine!
- They sure are.
- Every one.
Well, let's leave Whatsis and the puppies here.
Now, let's go look at the first sunrise.
In the fallen of the old days, that Rome must need to withdraw her legions from England.
Then stood the realm in great darkness and danger.
For every overlord held rule in his own tar and fought with fire and sword against his fellow.
Then against these dark forces, rose up a new a new force, wherein flowered courtesy, humanity and novel chivalry.
Your kinsman must have been here before us.
He is still here.
I cry Morgan le Fay, rightful queen of England, and her Knight champion, Mordred, lord of the lsles.
I cry Arthur Pendragon, duke of Gwen.
God keep you stepsister.
God spare you stepbrother.
Not in a wise made us meet here, but we are here.
Do we meet as foes?
We meet as kinsmen to put an end to bloodshed and restore the throne
And which of us speaks as the king of that throne.
He who is Uther Pendragon's son, his high king of England.
I am the only issue, born to Uther into wedlock.
No son was born to him by his rightful queen.
Yet your father was sired a son.
Born in shame. His son nonetheless.
Morgan le Fay is the rightful heir.
And Mordred, the rightful king.
My lady, we are met here so that he who is the rightful king shall prove it.
Come.
What words are those carved upon the stone?
I am the sword Excalibur.
Who so pulled me from this anvil is the right wise born king of all England.
How do we know this is the sword the legend spoke of?
And if it be the true sword,
Why did Merlin alone know where it is hidden?
Because the king Uther Pendragon revealed to me alone the night before his death.
Then I shall take what is mine.
Sire.
That is not the true sword.
It is the true sword.
It is witchcraft!
Let no man say otherwise.
Then we must summon the council at the Ring of Stones and to the chiefs of all the lands, and they should decide, my lord.
They shall decide to hang thee by the tree and all thy witchcraft within.
And though you are the unnatural brother of this lady, you too should hang beside him.
We shall meet again at the council of the Ring of Stones.
King...of England. You are not.
What? Not yet.
You have still to prove it by deeds, not words.
Return it to the anvil.
Alas, good Lancelot. This Arthur fellow is as hollow as a broken promise.
This Arthur of yours must be a hundred leads to the other side of nowhere on a charge of made of nothing.
Others are real enough.
And man enough to ride as we do in pursuit of glory.
Alas. Good Lancelot.
How far in the name of reason will you chase this pompous, fancy knight.
To Arthur, to the world's end and beyond
We are there already.
Isle is the valley of death, where the devil himself has plowed under
Not so good, Sir Lancelot.
I hear the sound of life.
Sweet music to my hungry ears.
Four men against one him.
Chivalry hide thy face.
Come Simon. We'll look for something fiercer as a foe.
Sire, by your lead, my spirit is willing but my stomach cries for quarter.
Eat then and join me later to the ring of stones.
Shall we seek king Leograf at the ring of stones?
Yes, but not his daughter.
Guinevere is here with me now, Merlin.
Here in my heart, as she ever has been since the day we met his children.
And as she always will be till the day this heart no longer beats.
Kind words. And I shall make her queen of all this island.
Queen of all England.
Oh harder to do than unheard deed.
Now from hereon this is Mordred's land.
I shall travel a different road to you.
Go by the towns and let me go through the forest.
This is not as we have planned.
It is I've planned it now though.
Why?
If one of us is ambushed, the other will live to confound Mordred at the Ring of Stones.
Peace guarded that it be you.
Ride with him.
No. It is your breath Mordred seeks, not mine.
Stay with your master.
Ride alone you shall not.
I'll go through the forest and you shall take Venavier.
Or not of us move a step from here till doomsday.
I see I have been pressed to a mule.
Very well.
Go to the forest and godspeed be with you.
You have been more of a father to me of wisdom and strength than he who sired me.
Without you I endure life.
With you I rejoice in it.
Godspeed.
Which road does Arthur take?
Through the forest.
Sire, what about my reward?
You promise me enough gold to silence me.
Was there never enough gold in Crisnum to silence a traitor; nevertheless, silence him.
Here we part company.
Bring me word from the Ring of Stones when Arthur is dead.
Within an hour.
Mordred, where have you gone without me?
To the council of kings to the Ring of
Stones. I do not want you there.
Why not? Your wife might be in peril.
Where you go, there I go also.
Did I have to say as much in words?
Why are you late, sir knight?
Why, how late am l, my lady?
I've been waiting for you since dawn.
Alas, my lady. How will I shall know?
You should have known by magic.
Magic?
It's very easy.
I made a wish in the pool for a knight to come riding and carry me off.
And I am the knight. Of course you are.
May I ask my lady's name? Elaine.
Of what place? Of Optines.
Come nearer, perhaps you would like to ride.
Where are you taking me?
To your home if you will tell me where it is.
I told you who I was, but you haven'told me who you are.
I'm Lancelot of the Lake.
King Banes'son of Benwick.
Where is Benwick?
In France. Then it must be near from England.
I come in search of a great hero called Arthur Pendragon.
What will you do when you find him?
Ride the wide world by his side.
What will you ride in search of?
Oh giants and unicorns. beyond England, the sea of white bears and witch whales.
Beyond the sea, the happy islands, where no one ever grows old.
Or so stare at the harbor and they'll sing you a few songs.
Have you a lady? No.
Then I shall be your lady.
And one day you will come back and take me to the happy islands.
What is it? Nothing that will harm you.
Who stands?
Come forward and declare thyselves.
Why do you seek me?
Why do you lie in hiding like a mane?
So it's a nest of mane.
Well good sirs, draw your swords before my friends arrive.
5 to 1 is all that Arthur himself can hope for.
Are you Arthur's man?
To the dead. Kill him.
The lists is open.
Who dare come in next?
Behind you.
Thanks my lady.
It's time to lead ole might.
I can take care of myself. Now stand off
Not while I live.
I yield. Dare fight. I yield.
Dare fight. Ambush!
What now? Now, my lady,
I could take you home for supper.
That meddler again.
Sire, I thank you for the help I did not need.
Those are brave words, sire, but hardly grateful.
You deny and you spoil my fight.
Why sire? Do you seek another?
Do you not owe me one?
Come pay your debts.
With broad swords if you wish.
Sir Lancelot, I'm hungry.
I'll be with you in the passing of a minute.
Take care so that it will not be a passing of a knight.
Sire, I have never met your like before.
In combat you have no peer.
I am Lancelot of the Lake.
By the fate of my body I must know who you are.
I am Arthur Pendragon.
Arthur.
Why do you break a sword that serves you with such might?
It struck you.
Then you shall have mine.
May it serve you half as well.
My lord. While I live,
I shall remember this hour.
By the ache of every bone,
I shall never forget it.
Stand and declare thyself, cowboy.
I am no cowboy, sire.
I am Percival of Optines.
I ride in search of my sister, Elaine.
A thousand pardons to yourself and to your horse.
Yonder is the lady you seek,
I think.
Asleep and safe.
Elaine.
Elaine.
Percival. We've been searching the countryside for you.
I've been in such a battle. A battle?
We fought five men. We?
This knight and l. This knight and you.
He and that other knight.
Sires, who are you?
I am Lancelot of Benwick and this is Arthur Pendragon.
Arthur. Sire. My lord.
My lords. Let me be your man to ride with.
Let me be your knight earl.
What heirs would you seek?
The holy grail, my lord.
Your ambition soars high for such young wing.
Will you not help me to prove myself worthy of it?
If all goes well with our cause,seek us at Camelot, if there it should be war seek us at the battlefield and prove yourself in combat.
I shall my lord.
Thank you.
Come sister.
Goodbye, sir Lancelot.
I shall be awaiting you when you return from happy islands.
Till then my lady, fare you well.
Happy islands? Where are they?
You should know my lord. Perhaps in the heart. Do you not seek them to?
I know but one island, and it is not a happy one.
My task is to make itself. Where is it?
We're standing upon it now.
It shall be happy, my lord.
We shall make itself.
We are not many people, we are one people.
Bound together by the sea above us and our enemies from without.
We do not have many causes, we have one cause.
England.
England which now stands in mortal peril and we alone can save it. How
There must be an end to all these strives among us, to the burning and the killing.
You're not our judge, nor our leader.
Don't pretend to be our judge and our leader.
Beware of this man, my lords.
He will only throw the king's fete to crown himself.
I claim from no one that is not rightfully mine.
Then from a man who is not even rightfully born.
Let me speak
My lords... the true ruler of England is her law.
It is as old as these stones which were raised to measure of the sun and the motion of the stars.
Each one is balance by its neighbor with all the cunning of the nation's skill.
If each stone keeps in balance, then all will stand forever.
So it is with England.
Let each man keep in balance with his neighbor and all our world stands still.
I am Mar, king of the Pits.
Does any man dare tell what I must do?
Not one man, nor a hundred, nor a hundred thousand. but the people of England.
The dark knight of their recklessness crushed with hungry, fear and misery.
They cry out. Let there be peace.
Hear him.
He will lead only rebellion in the land against his master.
You will make us serve the peasants who were born to serve us.
Who is Arthur Pendragon to speak such words to kings?
Which of you is a true king?
Mar, who comes from the broken wall of Rome with his painted pitch and burned land.
Mark and his cornice pirates
Brian and his slave race in an unprotected coast.
There is no true king in all England until this council names one and obey him.
It is ordained that I shall be the rightful king of England.
I will be king my lords.
With peace if I can.
By war if I must.
Neither I nor my friends lack bows and spears.
And if the people lack goods which you plunder, they do not lack anger nor courage.
Choose!
Let the traitor perish while his treacherous is still black upon his lips
Arthur ride!
Barings!
What will it be my lord, Camelot or the battlefield?
To the battlefield.
We'll crown you king by Christmas.
Where are you going?
Home.
With your village left standing by Mordred's men.
No.
But if I have to starve to dead.
I'd choose to starve to dead there better than here.
I love this horse like a brother.
I would kill him with my own hands and you could eat his flesh if it will give you half the courage to the man you are deserting.
Keep your horse.
What shall I give thee as a Christmas gift, good Sir Louise?
Find words from a man whose pocket is as empty as his wits.
Is this empty? The right Merry Christmas
And the right Merry Christmas to you,
Sir Galant.
Gently. Gently.
The wind is as gentle as ever.
Better the beast, wolf. And Galant is to festive for his mood.
I wish I were. I'm rusting faster than my sword.
How is the knight? Time is frozen solid.
Why shouldn't we attack Mordred, my lord?
When the first spring source set in.
Why not now?
No where we can find Mordred in the weather, too.
This is not fighting I know.
It's a kind of creeping death.
Nevertheless, we are fighting.
And surely as if we were in the field.
Lancelot.
This is the season of the year when men give gifts to those they hold esteem.
I esteem thee more than any other man.
Friend shall I be. Call me another.
This is a pledging to its brother and brother.
Christ is born. He is born.
Does each man know the plan?
Each man is in his place, and each man knows his orders.
Do they but obey them and
Mordred will never forget this day.
Mordred will not forget this day.
May he not live to.
May this be the sword that beats him sweet farewell.
Is that all the strength they can muster?
Old men. Lame boys.
The day is ours already.
England is ours already.
Death to Arthur.
Stand and behold. Arthur is dead.
The day is mine.
Arthur lives. The day is still ours.
Get drown. Get drown.
Get drown? I think they are in retreat.
Now for the kill. Pursue and slay!
Pursue and slay!
We have them. Perish them all and dead for all.
Do you see my banner shame?
Strike the dragon banner bearer.
He has won his first, my lord.
He has done wonderfully.
Fine work, Percival.
And now for England.
Forward. Make them fall like apples in a gale.
The day is ours.
Hail to Arthur, king of England.
Hail to Arthur, king of England!
My lords, do you accept Arthur Pendragon as your king?
Then accept also his pardon.
Whereby he does absolve you all from retribution.
So that to keep the peace of England.
My lords! in true penitence I do confess my wrongs against King Arthur.
And beg live to serve him loyally as his knight.
That live I freely give.
Sire, I request that the deeds of this knight be put to banishment.
Would you have me break my word?
The war is over Lancelot, and I begin my reign in peace and honor.
This man will destroy you.
Sire, must I stand and be rebuked by this mongering knight.
I will give this satisfaction...
Stop! Stop Mordred.
Put up your swords.
Are you not an outlaw?
Cool your hot blood and keep your place.
Which is high enough, but not above the good of the realm.
My lords, Arthur Pendragon will be crowned king in the city of Camelot.
There also will he wed the princess Guinevere.
Then shall you all assemble to pay homage to him and to his queen.
So be it.
I am King Banes' son of Benwick rebuked by you before this company.
While that man lives
I will not pay you homage.
Sing up Lancelot.
Where's that voice Lancelot with thy heart and thy boot?
Let him be you rattlesnake .
Whose shields are these?
Ask who they were, sir knight?
Why. They all three slain.
Well, not slain. Would you say esquire?
Oh not certainly esquire, but put to sad saw shame.
Our lord master stripped them of all.
Armor, horses and their lady.
And out they went on foot like penitence
What lady is this you speak of?
Why the lady under escort of the three nights.
Didn't you see there a way?
Then your master is a naive and a dog.
Then good sir knight by your leads, we will throw dice for your horse now.
Wait for me here.
State your purpose.
You hold a lady against her will.
Perhaps, not against mine.
I beg you let her go free.
If you would free her that would be simply done. Slay me first.
That sir knight shall be my pleasure.
I heed you fight fiercely.
If I slay you while you hit then the lady's heart will melt like butter in my hand.
You will be melting in another place, sir knight.
But where is the lady?
Fine, the head of my shield seems to accept me as champion.
There the lady stand.
My lady will you take me for your champion?
Tell me first, sire. Who are you?
He who would be your champion.
And why do you champion my cause?
Because my lady I have seen many wonders in my time, but not in this world as beautiful as you.
Sire, he is the... Brigette.
I take you for my champion, sir knight.
For the lady.
He's all bark and no dog, your highness.
He barks well enough.
Now let us see how he bites.
I cry porter.
You'll be crying porter, sir knight, unless you swear to take the lady wherever she decides to go.
And because you've dishonored a good knight, you shall give up your armor, hang your shield besides the others on that tree.
I swear it. I swear it.
Mean thy ways, sire.
There is some good in you.
And guard the lady well.
On my honor.
You are free my lady.
Where do you go from here?
To the wedding of King Arthur and Princess Guinevere in Camelot.
Will you ride there with me?
I wish it could be so. my lady, but it cannot.
Sir Adolf Pek Ok Yander will conduct you there in safety.
Tell me, Sir Knight. Who are you?
Forgive me lady, but there is shame upon my name.
I think that you've never done a shameful thing, nor ever will.
For that may God's mercy be forever with you.
For God's mercy be forever be with you, too.
My lady.
Every knight in England must be here today.
I wish Sir Lancelot were here.
You have set another apple cart?
If it need a hundred apple carts, it would be a fair price of the sight of his face again.
She ever grows more beautiful.
They are a match.
And if they are not, they will make themselves.
Long live to King Arthur.
Long live to Queen Guinevere.
My lords, come forward and to each his homage as the ancient custom does degree.
My leader, it is said on this day of great rejoicing that any man may ask one favor.
And the King will grant it provided that it be not against the realm.
That is true. And I will do it, if it not be against the realm.
My master ask of you this honor that he may be the first to do you homage.
Who is your master?
Sir Lancelot of the Gate.
King Banes' son of Benwick.
Knight commander of the army of England.
I grant your request.
In my lead I am your man.
With my mouth and hands,
I swear to serve your cause against all odds.
My lord, I fought Lancelot and live.
Sir Lancelot, with my mouth and hands I swear we shall not fight again.
Sire, forgive my discourtesy at the Ring of Stones.
I rebuked you too sourly, and I say it before this company.
Pay homage also to your queen.
Guinevere, this knight is my banner, sword and shield.
This is the knight who came so swift to my rescue.
Lancelot? But so late in my wedding.
Sir Lancelot, I thank you for the rescue of my lady.
In gratitude I make you henceforth, the queen's champion.
I shall ever be in your quarrel to be your knight in right or in wrong at the hazard of my body,
From this day forth to my death.
Be thou my champion in right or in wrong.
You stand here in the presence of your peers to become knights of the round table.
Therefore, each man shall say aloud this vow:
I will fear God. Honor the king, and defend this realm with honor and might.
With God's good grace,
I will hold myself true to this fellowship of knights
In the name of each man here I vow in God's name, to do battle against all evil doers.
But never in any wrong cause nor do any outrage.
I will defend the helpless and protect all women, and be merciful to all men.
I will honor my word, and I will speak no treason nor slander.
I will be true in friendship and faithful in love.
All this I do swear on the hilt of my sword.
To all here, swear it likewise.
So be it. God, grant long life to the table round.
So England was blessed with Peace.
For while Arthur and Lancelot were united in friendship, no forces of evil were strong enough to prevail against the chivalry of the round table.
Doom! Do my ear look like an apple?
It was Duke with his harp.
He did it on purpose to spoil my aim.
Well your aim is as far as his music.
With that bow go, Wayne.
We can grow new apples quicker than we can grow new ears.
My new horse against yours.
I'll split that apple before you do.
I'll take it!
By your lead, my lady.
Stop daydreaming.
You're in a court now, not in a meadow.
My lady.
This is my sister, Elaine.
Elaine? You may stand up. Thank you.
I beg you to make her a lady in waiting.
She refuses to stay home anymore.
Is that you would like?
Music!
You owe me a horse, sir knight.
Sir Lancelot of the Lake, my sister.
My lady.
Have you found the happy islands yet?
Happy islands, my lady?
Have you forgotten them as easy as you have forgotten me?
Forgotten you?
By a thousand pardon my lady.
But how grown up you are.
You think so, too?
Everyone does except you.
Are you still making midsummer wishes?
No. That was the only one
I shall ever make.
Is your horse well? Barings? Yes.
He will remember you, and he will be delighted to see you again, my lady.
When will I see him?
Do you presume that a knight of the round table had nothing better to do than to show you his horse?
When may I see Barings.
He was part of my wish.
You shall see him tomorrow, my lady.
Where have you seen that child before?
In the wood. In a midsummer's eve.
She made a wish in a pool for a knight to come riding by and carry her off.
And did a knight come riding by and carry her off?
Not while I was there.
Am I deceived, or do I sense a pair of royal turtle doves?
What is that?
Oh, a coin. How beautiful.
It's yours.
Thank you.
Do you know what I think?
We should set a trap to catch our turtle doves, my lord.
My lady, that is a new necklace you're wearing this evening.
May I admire it? lf you wish?
An old coin, how curious and charming.
Only one who loves most deeply gives such an unusual token to his lady.
I had not notice it. Why, my lord.
To give such a gift and not notice it, when it is worn in your honor.
It was given to me by Sir Lancelot, not the king.
By Lancelot. I wish that
I could charm you in such a gift, sire.
What must I do to deserve it?
By pleasing you with my dancing.
Will that be a beginning?
I'm already in your debt, my lady.
May I delight my lord, my lady?
Alas, my lady, you have come off worst.
But never mind. After this,
Sir Lancelot shall dance with you for the rest of the evening.
I shall command it.
Well sire, now that we're alone.
What is the great secret?
A pleasant one I hope.
Not pleasant, and no longer, unfortunately, a secret.
A delicate matter and yet
I must be bland.
The court is a very elegant place, my lady.
And dubbed as so when you are queen of it.
But its walls, not only have ears, they have eyes. And they have lips.
No one is safe from them, my lady.
Not even the king himself. Not even you.
Are you trying to tell me that
I have enemies?
Everyone in the court has enemies.
If the queen could lie that the men will believe, it could break the round table and destroy the kingdom.
What lie can they make of me?
One that would involve Lancelot.
Lancelot is my husband's friend.
And Mordred is your husband's enemy.
Does my husband know of this?
Not from my lips.
Then I shall tell him. No, my lady.
Why not?
If Arthur believed you and banished Mordred,
I should no longer be able to keep an eye on him which I do very well here
If he disbelieve you, you would have done yourself great harm in his trusting eyes.
And what of Lancelot in all of these?
It is Lancelot for whom I am concerned.
He is the torch which
Mordred would light up even.
This is horrible. It is life.
Lancelot is too vulnerable.
To be out of reach of this mischief, he should be safely married. Married?
I am glad it is I who sit watching your face at this moment and not Morgan le Fay, my lady.
Do you suspect me, too? No, my lady.
But I'm just as artful as she at weaving guilt out of the innocence,
Iet it be at the good of my cause.
That should be it.
It is not too cruel a sacrifice for the throne he serves.
Why so silent, child?
I am trying to find the courage to ask you a question, my lady.
Why it is so difficult? Because..
Is it about Sir Lancelot?
How did you know, my lady?
I guess. Now, ask me your question.
Does he love anyone, my lady?
He has never told me so.
Then there isn't anyone else.
No, no one.
Does he ever notice me and speak about me?
I'm sure he does.
My lady, would he marry someone who loves him as much as I do?
Even if he didn't love her very much.
Even he only loves her very little.
Would any woman be wise to marry a man who do not love her, my child?
It could bring heartbreak with it.
My heart would only break if I thought that I might never see him again.
Then you would marry him no matter what the cost.
Oh yes, my lady. Yes.
I will.
Men, you seek yourself for some wind,
I'll wait for you down the river.
Elaine was speaking of you as we rode here.
It does me great honor.
I come to know her very well.
I trust it pleases you.
Does she please you? Why yes. Why not?
How much does she please you?
Saving yourself, I would be her servant before all others.
Lesson Sheba. Lesson.
Stop Sheba.
Lancelot, there's something
I must tell you.
I know that you love me.
You would never tell me so, but I know that you do.
While it was our secret no harm and shame could come of it. but it is no longer a secret.
And we have enemies.
Those enemies will be silent if... you wed Elaine.
It is my wish that you do so, for she loves you too.
All through the war Arthur would speak of you.
I fought beside him shoulder to shoulder but you are forever in his heart.
You must not be in mine too.
I will do as you bid me.
Thank you.
Come Sheba.
Well flown. Yes, he flew too well.
Sire, if it would please you, I will go to the north as captain of the marches
You, Lancelot? Why?
There's good fighting in the north.
The Pigs are in revolt.
The Pigs are always in revolt.
Sire, you know me better than any man living.
My sword has been idled for too long.
I'm sick for the sound of battle.
I understand my man.
You have my lead to go.
I will also ask the favor of the lady,
Elaine.
Will you go with me my lady, as my wife?
Yes, my lord.
Happily.
Oh my lady. My child, our blessings be with you both..
My lady, and the favor of my wife,
I will remain your champion and carry your scarf and scroll as I've always done, in loyalty and in honor.
God go with you.
How we shall miss him.
I'm missing him already.
Advance the banner!
Lower!
Stand on! Lift! Stand on!
Forward on!
Which of us glean most as wonder to see them depart?
Whichever of us has the tenderness heart
Good. Then, neither of us is gleaning.
Is there any sign of him?
A messenger or horse, maybe?
I feel my husband somewhere near us,
Dwain.
I wish I had your faith, my lady.
Then do not falter in your own, Dwain.
I tell myself, three months, about a quarter of a year, but already, I feel I've been gone for three century.
They will come home safe. I can feel it.
They are very close to me.
I would even be closer to him if he'd taken me instead of that harper
Would you see that Garette can watch over my safety?
No, my lady.
He has no more sense of responsibility than his own silly harp.
Dwain. My lady.
Never a sign of a foe.
Will we ever see a pig?
They are hiding somewhere like badgers.
Or dissolve in the highland mist.
Then they'll smother us to dead.
Silence!
Form a ring!
Form a ring!
Shields!
Old Burt. You must muster it..
My lord, I lasted my last blood.
Wasn't I such non crude a knight after all.
You always be a good knight as
I have known.
Forward on!
My lady. My lady. Gently. Gently.
Oh Nanna, help me quickly.
My knight is here and I'm not ready to greet him.
Told you not to flush yourself.
I'm not flushing.
I am well. Truly, I am well.
Now that he is here.
My lady.
My lord.
The Scottish mist has rusted all his notes.
A lovely song, Garius.
But why such a sad one.
Right. Strike up a gay tune!
Will you dance, my lady? Yes.
Lancelot! Lancelot! Percival is here.
Percival! Percival!
Never with a face more welcome.
Never with a heart more cold and weary.
Come. Sit by the fire.
Bring me some wine. Yes, Sir.
What news? What news in the court?
You know more than l. We?
We knew nothing since we left there.
How long have you been gone from Camelot? Maybe weeks.
Is everything all well with you?
I'm upon a quest, sire.
What do you seek?
The holy grail.
At Pentecost. When the round table meet.
Every night, the savior would sat in his own place, then suddenly we heard the crash and cry of thunder. Louder and louder until we thought the walls was tumbling and would destroy us.
But then the tune had died and the hall was filled with light.
A hundred times more clear than day that no life could speak.
Then we heard music.
The skies were filled with joyful song.
A voice spoke. A voice?
It was the strangest thing.
But this is something
I do not even now understand. What?
Every night I heard the music and saw the light.
I was the only one who heard the voice.
What did it say? He said...
Percival, my love. Who has come out of worldly life into spiritual life.
Go forth. Seek the holy grail.
Blessed for it that our Lord drunk from it at the last stand supper.
When he died upon the cross for all mankind, he held his precious blood
Seek him.
To the end of the faith and what is eternal maybe renewed.
For in good time, the cup will return to earth.
And there remain and that men may be at peace with one another.
Blessed be God who lives and moves in all things eternally.
Amen.
The king granted me leave to go forth upon my quest.
But in his heart, it saddens him to see me go. First, Lancelot.
Now you, he said.
He is a lonely man.
You are twice welcome, my brother,
Percival.
Your coming has brought us both great joy.
My lady, will you see him to his comfort
I will make my rounds with the guards
All the happiness in my world is here with me now..
And mine has all renewed.
What is it?
Nothing, my lord.
Is loneliness nothing? I'm not lonely.
No.
I am.
I think you are also.
Great task brings great demands upon the situation, and sometimes great ways.
I also must watch you walk with it.
None may follow you and be accountable.
I least of all.
You most of all.
My lord, I honor your performance.
I often wonder how you can bring justice and rescue to your people.
At last. I have seen them.
By far with love far more understanding
Here are so many pretty queens than I
I love him also, Guinevere.
I did not know my sister could be so happy.
Whoever has put his trust in you, you would mahe happy.
Who knows better than l?
What I do not know is why I came to be chosen for the holy quest, instead of the choice of knight that has been christened.
Every world I ever conquest,
I saw and achieved. never have been beaten in a quarrel whether right or wrong.
But in holy things I know I will fail for the sins of my heart are not light.
And no power will make it pure again.
If there's a weight of sorrow in your heart.
Let mine be half await.
I know there is no sin in your heart.
For my own would look black and lost.
There's no sin in you, Percival.
And you will find what you seek.
The voice who spoke to you is God's.
My lord, Lancelot.
Come. Sit by me.
I will tell you the dream I dreamt.
About our son.
You are certain it is to be a son, are you?
I saw him. He was armed all in white.
Shield and spear of white.
And so is his horse.
He had your eyes, your smile.
And your bearing.
And yet, he was like no one save himself
There was a great light above.
I envy your such a dream.
You know, do you not?
That my dream will come true.
You always have.
You're always happy.
Why did you say that?
You never found your happy islands.
Strange that you should remember that idle jest of mine above all others.
It was no idle jest.
These are my happy islands.
I don't want more than these for life.
You indeed been made so happy by so little.
So little? if I had all my life to live again.
It will have nothing different.
Do you understand, Lancelot.
Nothing different.
I want you to remember that, always.
I will.
Is Mordred here? With King Mar.
What does Mordred so far knows?
Why have we been summoned here?
What have you come unless you've guessed my purpose.
I shall have no parts & parcels against
Arthur until the country is divided
Nor l.
What will divide it quicker than a clash between Lancelot and Arthur.
His head is full of wild nonsense.
Not wild or nonsense.
There is a frail link in Arthur's chain.
Lancelot is the queen's lover.
What else do you think I'm here, my lords?
If Mar would have slew for peace,
I will do the rest.
I slew Lancelot for peace.
Once the war has end, what would keep
Lancelot from returning to the court of Camelot.
Once at Camelot,
Lancelot and the queen will betray themselves.
I put my oath upon it.
I caught Lancelot if he returns, it's madness.
Wait, let me hear Mordred out.
I smell method in his mind.
Read it.
Sire, I give thee royal greetings.
The border is now under such good rule as you will have.
The Pigs under their leader Mar have ensued for peace.
With Garius and Dwain, I sent my son,
Galahad.
For whom in giving him life, my lady, his mother died.
Than hers, no heart is more constant and gentle and more forgiving.
I pray you'll take him to send my son to my father.
That he may have joy in his grandchild.
Be certain of our friendship and grace the queen may know that
I am her true servant still
Lancelot, knight.
When should you return to the north?
As soon as you please, Sire.
I will give you letters to Lancelot.
And then you shall go.
Sire, Lancelot must come back, he has been to long away.
You're right.
Sire, it is too soon to send for Lancelot.
Too soon, when the war is over?
Mar will be up in arms and back again as soon as his back is turned.
Lancelot still serve England best from the marches.
And would not come save by command, therefore, command him not to come.
Let us leave with the child, my lady.
I shall speak with Merlin on this matter later when his tongue is not so sharp.
When his tongue is not so sharp.
I would if I had the old raven throat between my fingers now.
Fingers lay bruises.
Merlin is old.
His death could easily look more natural
Make it so.
Merlin, I sent for you some hours ago.
Why did you not come to me?
Let's not quarrel about Lancelot.
If for real reasons be sound
I pledge to lead him in the north.
But let me request old retiring
If I shall be recalling...
I will have to ask you again.
Now, what do you say?
Merlin.
Merlin.
Forward! Advances!
Ready! At ease!
Knights and ladies, for as much as Sir Lancelot of the Lake has kept the king's guard on the northern marches well and faithfully, and he has now returned to court as the king's desire,
I do proclaim in the king's name 12 days of holiday, with such tournaments, feasting, dancing and merrymaking, that shall be devised hereafter.
Plague take the tournament.
Why must I run the course with every knight who wants to shout for his lady?
So that every lady will shout for you.
Though neither of them would shout for his ballads, he will still sing to them one after the other. and he can sing them one after another.
Till they shout for him for mercy.
What's that, my lord? A lady's veil?
Why not'S
Is it in memory of the lady Elaine?
I need no scarf to remember her.
Why, my soul. Lancelot is wearing a ladies veil on his arm.
A veil? But is he not still in mourning for his wife?
I thank God some lady has called his thoughts back.
Sire, my lady.
What is the most difficult art in the world?
It is the Chevanae.
We'll call a dancer that will dance around these stones, without breaking one.
If you doubt me,
Iay your wagers on the number he will break.
I wager he breaks none
Impossible. What will you wager? A kiss.
Is that the queen's new rival?
I wonder.
Agreed.
So far so good.
Take your wager.
Lady Vivian must best take care.
We are all a little jealous of her.
Are we not, my lady?
Leave me.
But madam who will tend to you?
I will tend to myself.
You're right, my lady.
The queen has gone to see Sir Lancelot.
The men are waiting and ready.
Fetch them to the east tar.
Go.
This time we shall not fail.
The king must prove absolute.
You must not be there when they are taken.
Arthur must think that we are innocent of this affair.
Wait here.
Then we will not fail.
Who is it?
My lady. Close the door.
What brought you here?
I must know what I've done that you should hurt me?
You have come at this hour to ask me that.
Where else can I ask you.
In the presence of the court, so that you could shame me.
But it's high treason for you to come here. You'll dishonor us both.
You cannot stay here, nor come to me, nor speak to me beyond my duty.
Is it a part of your duty to humiliate me for all to see?
My lady, this is all in your mind,
I beg of you to return to your chamber.
Speak with me tomorrow when no harm can come of it.
Why did you ignore me tonight?
Has your love for me turned to contempt?
Why? I must know why.
My lady, in only one thing you have mistaken me,
I do not love you.
It is not in my nature to love and honor
Only in my nature to fight and sport and eat, and to fight again.
Was it all a lie? Did you never love me?
What if I did. Nohing last forever.
Least of all, folly.
What are you saying?
Did you yourself not warn that Mordred watches our every move?
Is he such as fool not to be watching us this very moment?
Hoping it is you and not the lady Vivian that I favor.
As for the lady, Vivian.
She and I are the feather.
We demands on one another are alike.
We do not commit high treason.
Stop...
I beg you say no more.
I will not degrade myself before you again.
Who is it?
Death.
They are waiting on the stairs.
And it was I who had too little faith.
It's too late for silence, Lancelot.
You're trapped at last.
Mordred's men. He and Morgan have been waiting only for this moment.
Traitor knight.
We'll have your head on a pole and your trouble, too.
You shouldn't come out in your fancy suit and saddle smack.
Come out. Or we'll barrel down the door.
What is it? My sword.
Simon took my sword to mend the scabbard.
We're lost.
If we're lost, all is lost.
King, kingdom. England.
Agraven, if you withdraw and quit this place,
I swear and vow as knight that I will answer to the king.
You shall to the king, and his queen with you, in Mordred's presence.
Agraven. I will give myself up and stand trial if you will spare Lancelot. No.
Give ground, I'll unbar!
I had him.
All of them that have befallen shall be accounted for to Arthur.
But never by you.
Sire, you heard proof spoken under oath and without malice. and the Queen Grace has sicken me with that knight. and without the knowledge of her husband.
Go unattented to the quarter of Sir Lancelot.
Sires,you shall give your voice each one of you for or against if you choose.
You will bear in mind if they are declare guilty the penalty by law for high treason.
For the man, that his head be split from his body. That his body be dismembered, and his quarter shall be hang up on the high ways to the admonition of all traitors.
For the woman, that she be conveyed to the public square
Let her be burned alive before the people.
Sires give your voice, whether guilty or not guilty.
Sir Toll. Guilty.
Sir Lionel. Not guilty.
Sir Rector. Guilty.
I heard a great lie in rode here and without rest. Where is Lancelot?
I know not.
The king is here and the trial has all but ended.
Trial.
Therefore, it is found by true count of voices that Lancelot of the Lake and Guinevere
Queen, are each of them guilty of high treason against our sovereign lord, King Arthur.
I ask authority for men and arms, sufficient enough to take the traitor, Sir Lancelot.
Most noble king,
I give myself into your hands.
If it is a plea for mercy, you're coming at an ill time, Sir Lancelot.
The verdict of high treason has already been brought against you and the queen, Grace.
Why is the queen not with you?
Because the queen has been so greatly wrong, my leader, so I will hold her in safety until the wrong is righted.
Traitor!
Touching her loyalty and mine,
I will give full account.
First I must speak of friendship from which all else has sprang.
In the old days I rode in search of a man and found him and became his friend.
We fought side by side and endured all things together.
And if a time we differ and fell out, still I'll say that no two men living were truer friends.
Then again riding forth, I met a woman from that hour I loved her.
Her name is Guinevere, she's your queen.
My friend was your king.
It pleased her to make me her champion.
Therefore, I remained her servant and no others, saving only the lady, my wife to whose soul may God give her gentle rest.
A man and a woman may love each other all their lives with no evil between them.
I dare say that such love is good for by denial and suffering, the heart is purified.
Be that as if may my leader that if any knights save in your person will say that the queen is not a true wife,
I will make it good upon his body.
My leader, this man is no longer free of a battle.
He may only be condemned.
Sir Lancelot,
According to the law the penalty for you and the queen is death.
But by my authority, sovereign lord of this realm, neither the queen nor you shall die.
Punishment as shall be.
Therefore, I decree that Guinevere, my queen that was be conveyed to the convent of the holy nuns of Amsbrey, there to remain until the day of her death.
Sir Lancelot, when this land was in need and peril you gave service at its cause that it deserves rewarding by a headman's axe
Therefore, you shall be banished from this realm of England.
Never in your lifetime to return.
The penalty is death.
The sentence is banishment.
Sire, I give you thanks for your grace and mercy to the queen.
I will abide by this banishment though it be harsher than the losing of my life.
My leader.
It is you who have taught us that no one make sentences that should be above the law.
Men and women, high and low, are alike before the court of justice.
But you have twisted the law to your private favor.
If you shield the living, who shall avenge the dead, the outrage of murder
You have broken the oath taken in this very hall.
Mordred.
My lords, sires.
The last words in this matter has been spoken.
His last word in this matter has not been spoken.
Do you challenge the authority of the king?
King as so long we call him king.
Is the king in a man who shrinks from justice when he cried the loudest?
Are there of knights among us who believe that the truly proud and strong should follow none but he who is as strong as steel?
Is he a king of the man of straw?
Blind to save himself and his own grief and sick in the soul.
How strong is Arthur without Lancelot?
A strong as a man in the thick of battle who has his sword struck from his fist
A common pipe man could run him through.
At last did Mordrid succeed in his intent.
The great bond was broken.
With the queen taken from all men's eyes in sorrow and disgrace.
And Lancelot vanished from the land.
Evil days return to England.
Harkan.
You who command the opposing armies.
It is agreed that while this parley last that no knight shall draw his sword.
If any sword be drawn on either side a trumpet shall sound and dreadful war begin.
Arthur Pendragon, you asked for this truce.
What will you have to regain you?
Mordred, this carnage I seek to avert is unlike the old wars we fought against each other.
Once you lead out a plan against me, enemies of England.
This time the entire Englishman is against you because you are the enemy.
If I must war against my people and my knights the stroke that strike them dead is death to me.
The doom is yours, not mine.
Mordred, beware!
None will emerge the victor in this holocaust.
Friend will slay friend in this mist, not knowing whom he slays.
Before us lies only the darkness of utter destruction.
The end of chivalry.
The end of all our world.
In the name of God, I beg you to fore swear this war.
Upon my terms!
What are they?
First, you should withdraw your armies from all the lands in the west.
Second, that the lives and charter of the people of the west shall come under my domain.
Last, that the round table shall be disbanded. Never to be reassembled.
These are not terms to offer equals, these are terms to shame the banquish.
Sir Percival.
If I agreed these terms, will you pledge to wage no further wars?
If I be not provoked.
I agree to the terms.
Let it be done in writing!
Treason!
Master. My noble lord.
God forgive me I come too late.
What place is this? Chapel of the sword.
Excalibur
I'll return it where it came.
No longer bright. No longer glories.
Tarnished by my own hand. My lord.
Lancelot.
Lancelot.
Mordred.
You were right.
I should have destroyed him.
I won't be able to do it, before he grows again in strength.
I will. My sword.
Stained and blooded my own people.
Cast it into the sea, Lancelot.
Swear it. I swear it.
Go to Guinevere.
Tell her...
I love and forgive her.
Friend shall I be.
Call me no other.
It's a pledging to his brother and brother.
Wait at the hall of the round table until I join you there.
Let me go with you. No.
What I must do, must be done alone.
I bring you sad tidings my lady.
The king is dead.
His message to you is brief, two words.
What were they?
Forgiveness and love.
Thank you.
To the death!
To the death.
Barings!
Barings!
Barings!
What is it?
It was I who brought this fellowship to ruin and to death.
My heart is too sick to pray.
Lancelot.
The music.
Do you not hear it?
I hear nothing.
The light.
Almost blinds me.
But the hall is unchanged.
The cup.
The cup.
Percival my knight and servant.
This high vision is granted to such above, pure in heart.
To the end of faith in what is eternal may be renewed.
Of fellowship and honor, all is lost.
All of knights, Galahad, the son of Lancelot, shall be most worthy.
Give comfort there to Lancelot.
Whose guilt is all forgiven.
Whose heart shall now know peace.
Blessed be God who lives and moves in all things forever.
Alice in Wonderland
How do you get to Wonderland
Over the hill or under land
Orjust behind the tree
When clouds go rolling by
They roll away and leave the sky
Where is the land beyond the eye
That people cannot see
Where can it be
Where do stars go
Where is the grass that blooms
They must be somewhere
Where is the sunny afternoon
Alice in Wonderland
Where is the path to Wonderland
Over the hill or here or there
I wonder
Where
"... for if he does and had been of late...
"much accustomed to usurpation and conquest.
"Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him, and even Stigand-"
- Alice.
- Hmm?
- Oh, I'm listening.
- "And even Stigand,
"the Archbishop of Canterbury, agreed to meet with William... and offer him the Crown. "
"William's conduct at first was model-"
Alice. Will you kindly pay attention to your history lesson?
I'm sorry, but how can one possibly pay attention... to a book with no pictures in it?
My dear child, there are a great many good books in this world without pictures.
In this world, perhaps, but in my world, the books would be nothing but pictures.
Your world? Huh!
What nonsense.
- Now, once more.
- Nonsense?
- From the beginning.
- That's it, Dinah.
If I had a world of my own, everything would be nonsense.
Nothing would be what it is, because everything would be what it isn't, and contrariwise, what it is, it wouldn't be.
And what it wouldn't be, it would.
You see?
In my world, you wouldn't say "meow. "
You'd say,
"Yes, Miss Alice. "
Oh, but you would. You'd be just like people, Dinah.
And all the other animals too.
Why, in my world:
Cats and rabbits
Would reside in fancy little houses
And be dressed in shoes and hats and trousers
In a world of my own
All the flowers
Would have very extra-special powers
They would sit and talk to me
For hours, when I'm lonely
In a world of my own
There'd be new birds
Lots of nice and friendly how-de-do birds
Everyone would have a dozen bluebirds
Within that world
Of my own
I could listen
To a babbling brook
And hear a song that
I could understand
I keep wishing
It could be that way
Because my world would be
A wonderland.
Oh, Dinah. It's just a rabbit with a waistcoat- and a watch!
Oh, my fur and whiskers!
I'm late, I'm late, I'm late!
Now this is curious. What could a rabbit possibly be late for?
- Please, sir!
- I'm late, I'm late
For a very important date
No time to say hello, Goodbye
- I'm late, I'm late, I'm late
- It must be awfully important.
Like a party or something.
Mr Rabbit! Wait!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
I'm overdue
I'm really in a stew No time to say goodbye, Hello I'm late, I'm late, I'm late
My. What a peculiar place to have a party.
You know, Dinah, we really shouldn't... um- be doing this.
After all, we haven't been invited, and curiosity often leads to trouble.
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
Goodbye, Dinah.
Goodbye!
Oh.
Well, after this, I shall think nothing of fall-
Oh. Of falling down stairs.
Oh!
Ahh.
Whoa!
Goodness. What if I should fall right through... the centre of the earth-
Oh! And come out the other side... where people walk upside down?
Oh, but that's silly.
Nobody- Oh!
Oh, Mr Rabbit! Wait!
Please!
Curiouser and curiouser!
- Ohh!
- Oh! Oh, I beg your pardon.
Whew. Ha. It's quite all right, but you did give me quite a turn.
- You see, I was following-
- Rather good, what? Doorknob? Turn?
- Please, sir.
- Swell, huh?
One good turn deserves another.
What can I do for you?
Well, I'm looking for a white rabbit, so, um, if you don't mind-
Eh? Oh!
- There he is! I simply must get through.
- Sorry. You're much too big.
- Simple impassable.
- You mean impossible.
No, impassable.
Nothing's impossible.
- Why don't you try the bottle on the table?
- Table? Oh!
Read the directions and directly you'll be directed in the right direction.
"Drink me. "
Hmm. Better look first, for if one drinks much... from a bottle marked "poison," it's almost certain to disagree with one sooner or later.
- Beg your pardon?
- I was just giving myself some good advice.
But- Mmm.
Tastes like, uh, cherry tart.
Custard, pineapple, roast turkey. Goodness!
- What did I do?
- Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho.
You almost went out like a candle.
But look!
I'm just the right size.
Oh, no use.
I forgot to tell you.
I'm locked!
Oh, no!
Uh, but of course, uh, you've got the key, so-
- What key?
- Now don't tell me you've left it up there.
Oh, dear.
- Whatever will I do?
- Try the box, naturally.
Oh!
"Eat me. " All right, but goodness knows what this will do.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, oh!
What did you say?
I said, "A little of that went a long way. "
Well, I don't think it's so funny.
Now- Now I shall n- never get home!
Oh, come, come, now.
Crying won't help.
I know, but I-I-
I just can't-
I can't stop!
Come! Oh! Say, this won't do.
It won't do at all.
You! You up there!
Stop!
I say! Oh, look!
The bottle. The bottle!
Oh, dear. I do wish
I hadn't cried so much.
Oh, a sailor's life is the life for me
How I love to sail on the bounding sea
And I never, never, ever do a thing about the weather
For the weather never, ever does a thing for me
Oh, a sailor's life is the life for me
Tiddlee um pom pom
Deedle dum dum dee
And I never, ev-
Ahoy!
And other nautical expressions!
Land ho, by Jove!
- Where away, Dodo?
- Dodo?
Three points to starboard.
Pull away, me hearties.
Have you in port in no time at all.
- Oh, yo-ho-ho and a bottle of sea
- Uh, Mr Dodo! Please!
- We'll all fish fry as we sail the sea
- Please help me!
Um, uh, uh, pardon me, but, uh, would you mind helping me, please?
Yoo-hoo. Yoo-hoo!
Help me. Please!
Won't you-
Help me!
Forward, backward, inward, outward
Come and join the chase
Nothing could be drier than a jolly caucus race
Backward, forward, outward, inward bottom to the top
Never a beginning
There can never be a stop
Hopping, skipping, hopping, skipping
Fancy-free and gay
That's all they did tomorrow but you finished yesterday
Round and round and round we go until forevermore
Once we were behind but now we find we are be-
Forward, backward, inward, outward
Come and join the chase
Nothing could be drier than a jolly caucus race
Ah, backward-
I say! You'll never get dry that way.
- Get dry?
- Have to run with the others.
First rule of a caucus race, you know.
But how can I-
That's better. Have you dry in no time now.
No one can ever get dry this way.
Nonsense! Why, I'm as dry as a bone already.
- Yes, but-
- All right, chaps. Let's have it now.
Look lively.
The White Rabbit.
Mr Rabbit. M-Mr Rabbit-
- Oh, my goodness! I'm late. I'm late.
- Oh-oh, don't go away.
- I'll be right back.
- I'm late, I'm late.
- I'm late, I'm late. - Don't step on the fish! Uh, w-w-watch it there.
Stop kicking that mackerel.
Brilliant!Jolly well-
Mr Rabbit.
Oh, Mr Rabbit.
Oh, dear, I'm sure he came this way.
Do you suppose he could be hiding?
Hmm.
Not here.
I wonder.
No, I suppose he must've-
Oh! Why, what peculiar little figures.
Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum.
If you think we're waxworks, you ought to pay, you know.
Contrary to wax, if you think we're alive, you ought to speak to us.
- That's logic.
- Well, it's been nice meeting you.
Goodbye.
You're beginning backwards.
Aye, the first thing in a visit is to say:
How do you do and shake hands
Shake hands, shake hands
How do you do and shake hands and state your name and business
- That's manners.
- Really?
Well, my name is Alice, and I'm following a white rabbit, so-
- No, you can't go yet.
- No, the visit has just started.
- I'm very sorry.
- Would you like to play hide-and-seek?
- Or "Button, button, who's got the button"?
- No, thank you.
If you stay long enough, we might have a battle.
That's very kind of you, but I must be going.
- Why?
- Because I'm following a white rabbit.
- Why? - Well, I-I'm curious to know where he's going.
Oh, she's curious.
The oysters were curious, too, weren't they?
Aye, and you remember what happened to them.
- Poor things.
- Poor things.
Why? What did happen to the oysters?
- Oh, you wouldn't be interested.
- Oh, but I am.
No, no, you're in much too much of a hurry.
- Well, perhaps I could spare a little time.
- You could?
Well!
"The Walrus and the Carpenter. "
Or "The Story of the Curious Oysters. "
The sun was shining on the sea
Shining with all its might
He did his very best to make the billows smooth and bright
And this was odd because it was
The middle of the night
The walrus and the carpenter
Were walking close at hand
The beach was wide from side to side
But much too full of sand
Mr Walrus said the carpenter
My brain begins to perk
We'll sweep this clear in half a year
If you don't mind the work
Work!
- Th-The time has come
- The walrus said
To talk of other things.:
Of shoes and ships and sealing wax
And cabbages and kings
And why the sea is boiling hot and whether pigs have wings
Calloo, callay
No work today
We're cabbages and kings
Oh, uh, oysters, come out and walk with us.
The day is warm and bright.
A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk, would be a sheer delight.
Yes, and should we get hungry on the way, we'll stop and, uh, have a bite.
But Mother Oyster winked her eye
And shook her heavy head
She knew too well this was no time
To leave her oyster bed
The sea is nice
Take my advice
- And stay right here
- Mum said
Yes, yes, of course, of course, but, uh, ha-ha!
The time has come my little friends
To talk of other things
Of shoes and ships and sealing wax of cabbages and kings
And why the sea is boiling hot and, uh, whether pigs have wings
Calloo, callay
Come run away
With cabbages and kings
Well, now, uh, let me see.
Ah! A loaf of bread is what we chiefly need.
Listen, how 'bout some pepper and salt and vinegar, eh?
Well, yes, yes. Splendid idea.
Ha-ha. Very good indeed.
Now, if you're ready, oysters, dear, we can begin the feed.
- Feed?
- Oh, yes. Uh-
The time has come my little friends to talk of food and things
Of peppercorns and mustard seed and other seasonings
We'll mix 'em all together in a sauce that's fit for kings
Calloo, callay
We'll eat today
Like cabbages and kings
I, uh- I-I weep for you.
I- Oh, excuse me.
I deeply sympathize.
For I've enjoyed your company... oh, much more than you realize.
Little oysters.
Little oysters.
But answer there came none
And this was scarcely odd because
They'd been eaten, every one
Well, uh-
The time has come!
With cabbages
And kings
- The end.
- That was a very sad story.
Aye, and there's a moral to it.
Oh, yes, a very good moral, if you happen to be an oyster.
- Well, it's been a very nice visit-
- Another recitation.
- I'm sorry, but-
- Entitled "Father William. "
- But really, I'm-
- First verse.
You are old, Father William the young man said
And your hair has become very white
And yet you incessantly stand on your head
Do you think at your age it is right, it's right
Do you think at your age it is right
Well, in me youth
Father William replied to his son
I'd do it again and again and again
And I've done it again and again and again
I wonder who lives here.
Mary Ann! Oh, drat that girl.
Where could she have put them?
- Mary Ann!
- The rabbit!
Mary Ann!
No use! Can't wait! I'm awfully late.
Oh, me. Oh, my. Oh, me. Oh, my.
Excuse me, sir, but- but I've been trying to-
Why, Mary Ann!
What are you doing out here?
- Mary Ann?
- Don't just do something. Stand there. No, no! Go, go!
- Go get my gloves. I'm late!
- But late for what?
- That's just what I-
- My gloves!
- At once! Do you hear?
- Goodness.
I suppose I'll be taking orders from Dinah next.
Hmm. Now let me see.
If I were a rabbit, where would I keep my gloves?
Oh! Thank you.
Don't mind if I do.
Oh, no, no, not again.
Oh! Mary Ann!
Now you see here,
Mary Ann. Help!
I need help!
Whoo-hoo! Ha! Oh!
No! Help!
Monster! Help! Assistance!
- Oh, dear.
- A monster! A monster, Dodo!
- In my house, Dodo. Oh, my poor little-bitty house. - The dodo.
Steady. Steady, old chap. Can't be as bad as all that, you know.
Oh, my poor roof and rafters.
All my walls and- There it is!
By Jove!
Jolly well is, isn't it?
Well, do something, Doo-doo.
Yes, indeed. An extraordinary situation, but, uh-
But, but, but, but, but what?
But I have a very simple solution.
- Thank goodness.
- W-W-W-What is it?
- Simply pull it out the chimney.
- Yes, g-g-go on, go on. Pull it out.
Who, me?
Don't be ridiculous.
What we need is a- Uh-
- A lizard with a ladder!
- Hmm? Oh! Bill!
Bill! We need a lazard with a lidder- A lidder- A b-b-b-
- Can you help us?
- At your service, governor.
Bill, me lad, have you ever been down a chimney?
Why, governor, I've been down more chimneys-
Excellent, excellent.
You just pop down the chimney... and haul that monster out of there.
Righto, governor.
Monster?
Steady now. There.
That's better.
Bill, lad, you're passing up a golden opportunity.
- I am?
- You can be famous.
- I can?
- Of course!
There's a brave lad.
In you go now.
Nothing to it, old boy.
Simply tie your tail... around the monster's neck and drag it out.
- B-But-But, governor-
- Good luck, Bill.
Well, there goes Bill.
- Poor Bill.
- Uh, perhaps we should try a- a more energetic remedy.
Yes! Anything, anything.
But hurry!
Oh, I-I propose that we, uh-
- Yes, go on, go on. Yes, yes.
- I propose we, uh-
Oh!
By Jove! That's it.
We'll burn the house down.
Yes. Burn the house- What?
- Oh, no.
- Oh-ho-ho!
Oh, we'll smoke the blighter out
We'll put the beast to rout
Some kindling
A stick or two
Ah, this bit of rubbish ought to do
- Oh, dear
- We'll smoke the blighter out
- We'll smoke the monster out
- No, no! Not my beautiful bird house!
Oh, we'll roast the blighter's toes
We'll toast the bounder's nose
Just fetch that gate
We'll make it clear
- That monsters aren't welcome here
- Oh, dear. Oh, me, oh, my.
- A match? Thank you.
- Match?
Without a single doubt we'll smoke the monster out
We'll smoke the monster out
No! No!
My poor house and furniture.
Oh, dear.
This is serious.
I simply must- Ah!
A garden.
Perhaps if I ate something, it would make me grow smaller.
Let go! Help!
- I'm sorry, but I must eat something.
- Not me! You, you, you, you-
You barbarian!
Help!
Monster!
Help!
Ah! I'm late! Oh, dear.
I'm here. I should be there.
- I'm late, I'm late, I'm late.
- I say, do you have a match?
Oh, no. Must go. Goodbye.
Hello. I'm late, I'm late, I'm late.
- Wait! Please wait!
- Ah, young lady.
- Do you have a match?
- No, I-I'm sorry, but-
- Mr Rabbit!
- No cooperation. No cooperation at all.
Well, can't have monsters about.
Jolly well have to carry on alone.
Wait! Please!
Just a minute!
Oh, dear. I'll never catch him while I'm this small.
Why, what curious butterflies.
You mean bread-and-butterflies.
Oh, yes, of course, uh- Hmm?
Now who do you suppose-
A horsefly! I mean, a- a rocking horsefly.
- Naturally.
- I beg your pardon, but, uh, did you-
Oh, that's nonsense.
Flowers can't talk.
But of course we can talk, my dear.
If there's anyone worth talking to.
Or about.
- And we sing too.
- You do?
Oh, yes. Would you like to hear
"Tell It to the Tulips"?
- No, let's sing about us.
- We know one about the shy little violets.
- Oh, no, not that old thing.
- Let's do "Lovely Lily of the Valley. "
- How 'bout a daisy duet? - Oh, she wouldn't like that. - Oh, watch the rose.
Girls! We shall sing
"Golden Afternoon. "
That's about all of us.
Sound your "A," Lily.
La
Mi, mi, mi, mi, mi, mi mi, mi, mi, mi, mi, mi
La, la, la, la la, la, la, la, la
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Dum du dum-dum
Little bread-and-butterflies kiss the tulips
And the sun is like a toy balloon
There are
Get-up-in-the-morning glories
In the golden afternoon
There are dizzy daffodils on the hillside
Strings of violets are all in tune
Tiger lilies love the dandelions
In the golden afternoon
The gold afternoon
There are dog- and cat-erpillars
And a copper centipede
Where the lazy daisies
Love the very
Peaceful life
They lead
You can learn a lot of things from the flowers
For especially in the month ofJune
Ah, ah, ah, ah
There's a wealth
Of happiness and romance
All in the golden
Afternoon
All in the golden afternoon
The golden afternoon
You can learn a lot of things from the flowers
For especially in the month ofJune
There's a wealth of happiness
And romance
All-
The golden afternoon
Ah
- Oh, that was lovely!
- Thank you, my dear.
What kind of garden do you come from?
Oh, I don't come from any garden.
Do you suppose she's a wild flower?
Oh, no.
I'm not a wild flower.
Just what specie- or shall we say genus- are you, my dear?
Well, I suppose you'd call me... a Genus Humanus Alice.
Ever see an Alice with a blossom like that?
Come to think of it, did you ever see an Alice?
Yes. And did you notice her petals?
What a peculiar colour.
And no fragrance.
Just look at those stems.
Rather scrawny, I'd say.
I think she's pretty.
- Quiet, bud.
- But I'm not a flower.
Aha!Just as I suspected.
She's nothing but a common
Mobile Vulgaris.
Oh, no!
- A common what?
- To put it bluntly:
- A weed.
- I'm not a weed.
- Well, you wouldn't expect her to admit it.
- Can you imagine?
- Well, goodness!
- Don't let her stay here and go to seed.
- Go on now. Don't you take root-
- Please, girls!
We don't want weeds in our bed.
Move along, move along.
All right, if that's the way you feel about it.
If I were my right size, I could pick every one of you if I wanted to.
And I guess that would teach you.
You can learn a lot of things from the flowers.
Hm! Seems to me they could learn a few things about manners.
A
E- I-O-U
A- E-I-O-U
A- E-I-O-U
Who
U- E-I-O-A
U- E-I-A
A- E-I-O-U
Who are you?
Well, I-I-I hardly know, sir.
I've changed so many times since this morning, you see-
I do not see.
Explain yourself.
I'm afraid I can't explain myself, sir, because I'm not myself, you know.
I do not know.
Well, I can't put it any more clearly, for it isn't clear to me.
You? Who are you?
Well, don't you think you ought to tell me... who you are first?
Why?
Oh, dear, everything is so confusing.
- It is not.
- Well, it is to me.
- Why? - Well, I can't remember things as I used to, and-
- Recite.
- Hmm?
Oh. Oh, oh, yes, sir. Um-
How doth the little busy bee improve each shin-
Stop.
That is not spoken correct-ically.
It goes:
How-
How doth the little crocodile... improve his shining tail... and pour the waters of the Nile... on every golden scale?
How cheer-
How cheer-
How cheerfully he seems to grin.
How neatly spreads his claws... and welcomes little fishes in... with gently smiling jaws.
Well, I must say I've never heard it that way before.
I know.
I have improved it.
Well- If you ask me-
You? Heh!
Who are you?
Oh!
Uh, you there. Girl!
Wait! Come back!
I have something important to say.
Oh, dear.
I wonder what he wants now.
Well?
Keep your temper.
- Is that all?
- No.
Exact-ically what is your problem?
Well, it's exact-ically- exact-ical-
Well, it's precisely this:
I should like to be a little larger, sir.
- Why?
- Well, after all, three inches is such a wretched height-
I am exact-ically three inches high!
And it is a very good height indeed!
But I'm not used to it, and you needn't... shout!
- Oh, dear.
- By the way, I have a few more helpful hints.
One side will make you grow taller.
- One side of what?
- And the other side will make you grow shorter.
- The other side of what?
- The mushroom, of course!
Hmm.
One side will make me grow-
But which is which?
Hmm. After all that's happened, I-
I wonder if I-
I don't care.
I'm tired of being only three inches high.
Yi, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi!
A serpent! Help!
Help! Serpent! Serpent!
Oh, but please, please!
Off with you! Shoo! Shoo!
Go away! Serpent! Serpent!
- But I'm not a serpent.
- Ser- Indeed?
- Then just what are you?
- I'm just a little girl.
Little? Ha! Little?
Well, I am.
I mean, I-I was.
And I suppose you don't eat eggs either.
- Yes, I do, but, but, but-
- Ah! I knew it! I knew it.
Serpent. Serpent!
Oh, for goodness' sake.
Hmm! And the other side will-
The very idea.
Spend all my time laying eggs for serpents like her.
Goodness. I wonder if I'll ever get the knack of it.
There. That's much better.
Hmm. Better save these.
Now let's see.
Where was I?
Hmm. I- I wonder which way I ought to go.
'Twas brillig
And the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe
All mimsy were the borogroves
And the mome raths outgrabe
Now where in the world do you suppose that-
- Lose something?
- Oh!
Oh, uh- I-
I was- N-No.
I- I-I mean, I-I was just wondering-
Oh, that's quite all right.
Uh, one moment, please.
Ooh.
Second chorus.
'Twas brillig
And the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe
Why- Why, you're a cat.
A Cheshire cat.
All mimsy
Were the borogroves
Oh, wait!
Don't go, please.
There you are.
Third chorus.
Oh, no, no, no.
Thank you, but-
But I just wanted to ask you which way I ought to go.
Well, that depends... on where you want to get to.
Oh, it really doesn't matter, as long as I-
Then it really doesn't matter... which way you go.
And the mome raths outgrabe
Oh, by the way.
If you'd really like to know, he went that way.
- Who did?
- The White Rabbit.
- He did?
- He did what?
- Went that way.
- Who did?
- The White Rabbit.
- What rabbit?
But didn't you just say-
I mean- Oh, dear.
Can you stand on your head?
- Oh!
- However, if I were looking for a white rabbit,
I'd ask the Mad Hatter.
The Mad Hatter? Um, no, no, I-I don't think-
Or there's the March Hare... in that direction.
Uh, thank you. I-I think
I shall visit him.
Of course, he's mad too.
Oh, but I don't want to go among mad people.
Oh, you can't help that.
Most everyone's mad here.
You may have noticed... that I'm not all there myself.
And the mome raths outgrabe
Goodness. If the people here are like that, I-
I must try not to upset them.
How very curious.
If there are no objections let it be unanimous
- Oh, a very merry unbirthday
- A very merry unbirthday
A very merry unbirthday to us
A very merry unbirthday to me
- To who - To me - Oh, you
A very merry unbirthday to you
- Who, me -
Yes, you - Oh, me
Let's all congratulate us with another cup of tea
A very merry unbirthday
To
You
- No room, no room, no room.
- No vacancy.
- No room, no room, no room!
- But I thought there was plenty of room.
Ah, but it's very rude to sit down without being invited.
I'll say it's rude.
It's very, very rude indeed.
Very, very, very rude indeed.
Oh, I'm very sorry, but I did enjoy your singing, and I wondered if you could tell me-
You enjoyed our singing?
Oh, what a delightful child.
Things happen. I'm so excited!
We never get compliments.
- You must have a cup of tea.
- Ah, yes, indeed, the tea.
- You must have a cup of tea.
- That would be very nice.
I'm sorry I interrupted your birthday party.
- Uh-uh, thank you.
- Birthday? Ha-ha-ha.
My dear child, this is not a birthday party.
Of course not.
This is an unbirthday party.
Unbirthday? Oh, I'm sorry, but I don't quite understand.
It's very simple.
Now, 30 days hath Sept-
No. Well. An unbirthday-
If you have a birthday, then, you-
- She doesn't know what an unbirthday is.
- How silly!
Well, I-
I shall elucidate.
Now statistics prove prove that you've one birthday
Imagine.:just one birthday every year
Ah, but there are
364 unbirthdays
Precisely why we're gathered here to cheer
Why, then, today is my unbirthday too.
- It is?
- What a small world this is.
In that case-
- A very merry unbirthday
- To me
- To you
- A very merry unbirthday
- For me
- For you
Now blow the candle out, my dear and make your wish come true
A very merry unbirthday
To you
Twinkle, twinkle, little bat,
How I wonder what you're at.
Up above the world you fly...
Like a tea-tray in the sky.
- Oh, that was lovely.
- And, uh, and now, my dear, uh, you were saying that you would like to seek-
Pardon me.
Uh, you were seeking, uh, some information of some kind?
Oh, yes. You see,
I'm looking for a-
Clean cup, clean cup.
Move down!
- But I haven't used my cup.
- Drink up, drink up
Move down, move down
Drink up, drink up, move down
Would you like a little more tea?
Well, I haven't had any yet, so I can't very well take more.
Ah, you mean you can't very well take less.
Yes. You can always take more than nothing.
- But I only meant that-
- And now, my dear, something, uh, seems to be troubling you.
Uh, won't you tell us all about it?
- Start at the beginning.
- Yes, yes.
And when you come to the end, stop, see?
Well, it all started... while I was sitting on the riverbank with Dinah.
Very interesting.
- Who's Dinah?
- Why, Dinah's my cat. You see-
Ah! Cat?
- Get the jam. On his nose. Put it on his nose.
- On his nose, on his nose.
- C-C-Cat.
- Oh. Oh.
My goodness. Those are the things that upset me.
See all the trouble you've started?
- But really, I didn't think that-
- Ah, but that's the point.
- If you don't think, you shouldn't talk.
- Clean cup, clean cup.
Move down, move down, move down!
- But I still haven't used-
- Move down, move down, move down
Move down
And now, my dear, as you were saying?
Oh, yes. I was sitting on the riverbank with, uh, with you-know-who.
I do?
I mean my c-a-t.
Tea?
Just half a cup, if you don't mind.
Come, come, my dear.
Don't you care for tea?
Why, yes, I'm very fond of tea, but-
If you don't care for tea, you could at least make polite conversation.
Well, I've been trying to ask you-
I have an excellent idea.
Let's change the subject.
Why is a raven like a writing desk?
Riddles?
Let me see now.
Why is a raven like a writing desk?
- I beg your pardon?
- Why is a raven like a writing desk?
- Why is a what?
- Careful. She's stark, ravin' mad.
But, but it's your silly riddle.
You just said-
- Steady. Don't get excited.
- How about a nice cup of tea?
Have a cup of tea, indeed. Well,
I'm sorry, but I just haven't the time.
The time! The time!
Who's got the time?
No, no, no, no. No time, no time, no time.
Hello. Goodbye.
I'm late. I'm late.
- The White Rabbit!
- Oh, I'm so late.
I'm so very, very late.
Well, no wonder you're late. Why, this clock is exactly two days slow.
- Two days slow?
- Course you're late.
My goodness.
We'll have to look into this. Aha!
I see what's wrong with this.
Why, this watch is full of wheels.
Oh, my poor watch.
Oh, my wheels and springs.
- But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but- - Butter! Of course!
It needs some butter.
Butter!
- Butter!
- But-but-butter?
Butter. Oh, thank you.
Butter. Yes, that's fine.
Oh, no, no! No, no, no!
You'll get crumbs in it.
Oh, this is the very best butter.
What are you talking about?
- Tea?
- Tea! Oh, I never thought of tea! Of course.
- Don't! Don't! Not tea!
- Tea.
- Sugar?
- Sugar? Two spoons. Yes, y- Two spoons.
- Thank you, yes.
- Oh, please be careful!
- Jam?
- Jam! I forgot all about the jam.
- No! Not jam!
- Just shows you what a person'll do.
- Mustard?
- Mustard, yes! Mus-
Mustard?
Don't let's be silly.
Lemon- that's different.
That's- There.
That should do it.
- Look at that. - It's going mad. - Oh, my goodness.
- Oh, dear. - It's going mad.
Mad watch. - Oh, my goodness.
- I can't understand it. It was the best butter.
- Mad watch. Mad watch.
- Mad watch! - Oh, look. Do you think the springs- Oh, my goodness!
There's only one way to stop a mad watch.
Two days slow.
That's what it is.
- Oh, my watch.
- It was?
And it was an unbirthday present too.
- Well, in that case.
- A very merry unbirthday
To
- You
- Mr Rabbit.
Oh, Mr Rabbit! Oh, now where did he go to?
A very merry unbirthday to us, to us
- If there are no objections let it be unanimous
- Of all the silly nonsense.
This is the stupidest tea party
I've ever been to in all my life.
Well, I've had enough nonsense.
I'm going home.
Straight home.
That rabbit. Who cares where he's going anyway?
Why, if it hadn't been for him, I-
"Tulgey Wood. "
Hmm. Curious.
I don't remember this.
Now let me see.
Oh!
Mmm, no, no, please.
No more nonsense.
Now, if I came this way,
I should go back this way.
Oh, I-I beg your pardon.
My goodness. When I get home,
I shall write a book about this place.
If I- If I ever do get home.
Oh, uh, excuse me.
Um, could one of you tell me-
Uh- Heh-heh. Never mind.
Oh, dear. It's getting dreadfully dark.
And nothing looks familiar.
I shall certainly be glad to get out of- Oh!
Who. Who-who.
Who.
It would be so nice if something would make sense for a change.
Oh!
"Don't step on the mome raths. "
The mome raths?
A path!
Oh, thank goodness.
Ah. I just knew I'd find one sooner or later.
If I hurry fast, I might even be home in time for tea.
Oh. Oh, won't Dinah be happy to see me.
Oh, I just can't wait till I- Ah!
Oh, dear. Now I-
Now I shall never get out.
Well, when- when one's lost,
I- I suppose it's good advice... to stay where you are until someone finds you.
But- But who'd ever think to look for me here?
Good advice.
If, If, If, If I'd listened earlier, I-I wouldn't be here.
But- But that's just the trouble with me.
I give myself very good advice.
But I very seldom follow it
That explains
The trouble that
I'm always in
Be patient
Is very good advice
But the waiting makes me curious
And I'd love the change
Should something strange
Begin
Well, I went along my merry way.
And I never stopped to reason.
I should have known
There'd be a price to pay
Someday
I give myself
Very good advice
But I very seldom follow it
Will I ever learn
To do the things
I should
Will I ever learn
Learn to do the things
I should
And the mome raths outgrabe
Oh, Cheshire Cat!
It's you!
Whom did you expect?
The White Rabbit perchance?
Oh, no, no, no.
I- I-I'm through with rabbits.
I wanna go home!
- But I can't find my way.
- Naturally.
That's because you have no way.
All ways here, you see, are the Queen's way.
- But I've never met any Queen.
- You haven't?
You haven't?
Oh, but you must!
She'll be mad about you.
Simply mad.
And the mome raths outgrabe
Please, please! Uh, how can I find her?
Well, some go this way.
Some go that way.
But as for me, myself, personally,
I prefer the short cut.
Painting the roses red
We're painting the roses red
We dare not stop or waste a drop
So let the paint be spread
We're painting the roses red
Oh, painting the roses red
And many a tear we shed
- Because we know
- They'll cease to grow
In fact they'll soon be dead
Ohh, and yet we go ahead
Painting the roses red, red red, red, red, red, red, red
Painting the roses red
We're painting the roses red
Oh, pardon me, but, Mr Three why must you paint them red
Huh? Oh!
Well, the fact is, miss, we planted the white roses by mistake, and-
The Queen she likes them red
If she saw white instead
- She'd raise a fuss
- And each of us
- Would quickly lose his head
- Goodness!
Since this is the thought we dread
- We're painting the roses red
- Oh, dear.
Then let me help you.
- Painting the roses red
- We're painting the roses red
Don't tell the Queen what you have seen
Or say that's what we said but we're painting the roses red
Yes, painting the roses red
- Not pink - Not green - Not aquamarine
We're painting the roses red
- The Queen!
- The Queen!
- Queen!
- The Queen!
Cards, halt!
Sound off!
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, jack!
The rabbit.
H- H-Her Imperial Highness,
Her, Her Grace,
Her Excellency, Her Royal
Majesty, the Queen of Hearts!
- And the King.
- Hooray!
Hmm! Who's been painting my roses red?
Who's been painting my roses red?
Who dares to paint with vulgar paint
The Royal flower bed
For painting my roses red
Someone will lose his head
Oh, no, Your Majesty, please!
It's all his fault!
Not me, Your Grace!
The ace! The ace!
- You? The deuce, you say?
- No! Two!
- Not me! The trey!
- That's enough!
Off with their heads!
They're going to lose their heads
For painting the roses red
It serves them right, they planted white
The roses should be red
Oh, they're going to lose their heads
Silence!
Oh, please, please.
They were only trying-
- And who is this?
- Uh, well. Well, well, now, uh, uh, let me see, my dear.
It certainly isn't a heart.
Uh, do you suppose it's a club?
Why, it's a little girl.
- Yes. A-And I was hoping-
- Look up. Speak nicely.
And don't twiddle your fingers!
Turn out your toes. Curtsy.
Open your mouth a little wider.
And always say:
"Yes, Your Majesty. "
"Yes, Your Majesty. "
Now, um, where do you come from, and where are you going?
W- Well, I-I'm trying to find my way home.
Your way? All ways here are my ways!
Well, yes, I-I know.
But I was just thinking-
Curtsy while you're thinking.
It saves time.
Uh, yes, Your Majesty.
But I was only going to ask-
I'll ask the questions!
Do you play croquet?
- Why, yes, Your Majesty.
- Then let the game begin!
To your places. To your places. By order of the King. Hurry, hurry, hurry.
Shuffle deck!
Card cut! Deal cards!
Cards, halt!
Silence!
Off with his head!
Off with his head. Off with his head. By order of the King. Uh, you heard what she said.
- You're next, my dear.
- Oh, but-
Uh, yes, Your Majesty.
Oh!
- Stop!
- Oh, of all the impossible-
Do you want us both to lose our heads?
- Uh-huh.
- Well, I don't.
Uh, I say, how are you getting on?
- Not at all.
- Beg pardon?
I said, not at all!
Who are you talking to?
- Oh, uh, a cat, Your Majesty.
- Cat? Where?
There. Oh.
- Oh, there he is again!
- I warn you, child, if I lose my temper, you lose your head!
Understand?
You know, we could make her really angry. Shall we try?
- Oh, no, no!
- Oh, but it's loads of fun.
No, no, no! Stop!
Oh, no!
Oh, my fur and whiskers!
Oh, dear! Save the Queen.
Someone's head will roll for this!
Yours!
- Off with her-
- But, but, but, but consider, my dear.
Uh, couldn't she have a trial? Huh? First?
- Trial?
- Well, th-Just a, a little trial? Hmm?
Hmm. Very well, then.
Let the trial begin!
Your Majesty.
Members of the jury.
Loyal subjects.
And the King.
The prisoner at the bar is charged with enticing Her Majesty, the Queen of Hearts, into a game of croquet and thereby willfully...
- But- - and with malice aforethought, teasing, tormenting...
- and otherwise annoying our beloved-
- Never mind all that!
Get to the part where
I lose my temper.
Thereby causing the Queen to lose her temper.
Now, are you ready for your sentence?
Sentence? Oh, but there must be a verdict first.
Sentence first!
Verdict afterwards.
- But that just isn't the way!
- All ways are-
Your ways, Your Majesty.
Uh, yes, my child.
Off with her-
- But consider, my dear. Eh, we've called no witnesses.
- Huh?
Uh, couldn't we hear maybe one or two? Huh? Maybe?
Oh, very well.
But get on with it!
- First witness. First witness. Herald, call the first witness.
- The March Hare.
Uh, oh, oh, what do you know about this, uh, unfortunate affair?
- Nothing.
- Nothing whatever?
- Nothing whatever!
- That's very important!
Jury, write that down.
Uh, unimportant, uh,
Your Majesty means of course.
Silence! Next witness.
The Dormouse.
- Well-
- Shh!
What have you to say about this?
Twinkle, twinkle, little bat.
How I wonder-
That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet.
Write that down!
- Twinkle, twinkle. Twinkle, twinkle.
- Twinkle, twinkle.
Twinkle, twinkle.
What next?
The Mad Hatter.
- Off with your hat!
- Oh, my!
And, uh, where were you when this horrible crime was committed?
I was home drinking tea.
Today, you know, is my unbirthday.
Why, my dear, today is your unbirthday too.
- It is?
- It is?
It is?
- A very merry unbirthday
- To me?
- Oh, no!
- To you! A very merry unbirthday
- For me?
- For you!
Now blow the candle out, my dear, and make your wish come true.
A very merry unbirthday
To you
Oh! Your Majesty.
Uh, yes, my dear?
Look! There he is now!
- Huh? Wha- Who?
- The Cheshire Cat.
- Cat!
- Cat?
- Cat! Cat, cat, cat, cat!
- There he goes! There he goes!
- Oh, this is terrible! Help! Help!
- Stop him! Stop him!
- Stop him. Catch him.
- Somebody help me. Catch him.
- Get me the jam. The jam, quick.
- The jam! The jam! By order of the King.
The jam. Let me have it!
Somebody's head is going to roll for this!
- Aha!
- The mushroom.
Off with her h-
Oh, pooh. I'm not afraid of you.
Why, you're nothing but a pack of cards.
Rule 42: "All persons more than a mile high... must leave the court immediately. "
I am not a mile high.
And I'm not leaving.
Sorry. Rule 42, you know.
And as for you,
Your Majesty-
Your Majesty indeed.
Why, you're not a queen.
You're just a, a fat, pompous, bad-tempered, old ty- tyrant.
And, uh, what were you saying, my dear?
Well, she simply said that you're a fat, pompous, bad-tempered, old tyrant.
Off with her head!
You heard what
Her Majesty said.
Off with her head.
Forward, backward, inward, outward
Here we go again
No one ever loses and no one can ever win
Backward, forward, outward, inward bottom to the top
- Never let the-
- Off with her head!
Off with her head!
Just a moment! You can't leave a tea party without having a cup of tea, you know.
- But I can't stop now.
- Ah, but we insist.
You must join us in a cup of tea.
Off with her head!
Mr Caterpillar, what will I do?
Who are you?
There she goes.
Don't let her get away!
Off with her head!
Oh! Still locked, you know.
But the Queen!
I simply must get out!
- But you are outside.
- What?
See for yourself.
Why- Why, that's me!
- I'm asleep.
- Don't let her get away!
- Off with her head!
- Alice, wake up. Please wake up, Alice!
- Alice! Please wake up, Alice!
- Off with her head!
Alice! Alice. Alice.
Alice. Alice.
Will you kindly pay attention and recite your lesson?
Hmm? Oh. Oh! Uh, how doth the little crocodile improve his shining tail?
- And pour the waters of the-
- Alice, what are you talking about?
Oh. I'm sorry. But you see, the caterpillar said-
Caterpillar?
Oh, for goodness' sake.
Alice, I- Oh, well.
Come along. It's time for tea.
Alice in Wonderland
Over the hill
Or here or there
I wonder where
Alice in Wonderland
How do you get to Wonderland
Over the hill
Or under land
Orjust behind the tree
Alice in Wonderland
Where is the path to Wonderland
Over the hill
Or here or there
I wonder where
Neal, what do you suppose the missi髇 is?
Send Captain Patterson and his crew in,
Yes, sir.
Go in, please.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Professor Konrad, Captain Patterson,
Lieutenant Cruze, Lieutenant Turner.
How do you do, Professor?
We're honored, sir.
It's a pleasure, gentlemen.
I have a missi髇 for you, Captain.
You're to ferry Professor Konrad to Space Station A.
You're disappointed, Captain?
Missi髇 not important enough for you?
Oh, it isn't that, sir.
Well, anything Professor Konrad does is important.
Space Station A is his brainchild.
He fought for it. He built it.
It's just that, we were hoping for a crack at the exploratory orbit around Mars.
You'll get it.
You and your men have earned the chance.
But this missi髇 is of the gravest importance.
There are indications of serious trouble up there.
Professor Konrad will tell you about it when you're underway.
Until then, you're not even to discuss this with anyone.
Yes, sir.
Departure at 1400.
Your navigational data is being checked out.
Good luck, gentlemen.
At ease.
- Doctor.
- Lieutenant.
Lieutenant. Pleasure, Captain.
A lousy milk run. And we're stuck with it.
Look, we're the guys who made the first orbit around the moon.
We're not ordinary space jockeys.
They got freighters for that routine stuff.
You heard what the Colonel said.
This is a missi髇 of the gravest importance.
What's important about a taxi run to that bus depot up there?
Bus depot?
I'm sorry, sir. I...
No, no, Lieutenant. It's a good name for it.
It is a way station in space, spinning tirelessly 10,000 miles above our Earth, where travelers in space can take on oxygen, fuel, supplies of all kinds for their journeys
- to the far reaches of the universe.
- Yes, sir.
- Welcome aboard, Doctor.
- Thank you, Captain.
Excuse me, sir.
They're still fueling the second stage.
The liquid oxygen. I should know.
I've seen enough of these rockets blow up in my time.
- Departure on time, Captain?
- Yes, we'll be ready.
Our navigation is all preset for us, recorded on tape and fed into our autopilot.
I still want Lieutenant Turner to check it, though.
- Hey, where is that guy?
- Where else?
But, Larry, spaceships are dangerous.
I mean, what if it should get lost up there?
Or blow up or something?
Oh, I wouldn't know what to do without you.
I'm sorry, baby, but I don't have any other choice.
I'm the navigator, and they can't make a move without me.
He's saying goodbye to a friend.
Lieutenant Turner, report to the ship on the double,
Oh, Larry.
On the double, Lieutenant.
So long, honey.
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
Bye.
Thanks.
That was a pretty dirty trick, if you don't mind my saying so, sir.
Come on. Let's get this show on the road.
Better look over that flight plan again.
Ready, Professor? It's almost takeoff time.
Ready, Captain.
Starfire to Control Room, ready to take off.
Zero plunge,
Twenty, nineteen, eighteen, seventeen, sixteen, fifteen, fourteen, thirteen, twelve, eleven, ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, fire,
- You all right, Doctor?
- Y es. Y es, I'm all right.
First stage burnout, two seconds late.
Second stage, right on the nose.
We should be on predicted course and speed.
- Good. Verify it with the base.
- Yes, sir.
- Let's take a look at your baby.
- Fine. Fine.
There it is.
Your way station in space.
A few hours cruising, and we'll be there.
How many times have you made this run, Doctor?
100 or more, I should say.
I fought for the idea of a space station for many years, but it wasn't until that memorable day in 1957, when the first satellite was rocketed into space, that I got any support.
22 years ago, July 1963, we put the first materials for the space station into orbit around the Earth.
22 years ago, the first brave men stepped out into space, with 10,000 empty miles beneath them to assemble that material.
Dr. Konrad, the Colonel said there were indications of serious trouble up there.
What did he mean?
They've made some disturbing observations from the space station.
Apparently, we have some deadly neighbors in outer space.
Earth may be in mortal danger.
Captain, there's something strange going on out there.
Some sort of a beam.
What is it?
A beam, a ray.
Energy of some kind, God knows what.
It's gone! It just blew up!
Good men. Good men on her.
Captain, it's coming towards us.
Hang on!
Prepare for maximum acceleration.
It's overtaking us!
It looks like snow.
No, that ain't snow, Mike.
That's 醤gel hair.
We done died and gone to heaven.
Captain.
Give me a hand here, men.
Captain's been hurt.
- His head's cut.
- This must be what hit him when all that stuff was flying around the cabin.
It's a small cut.
There may have been concussi髇.
Where are we?
I was afraid you might ask that, Captain.
Lieutenant Turner here says we're in heaven.
Mr. Cruze doesn't seem to agree.
Myself, I'd vote for Alaska.
Alaska?
It's a bad joke, my boy.
I've no idea where we are.
But first things first.
How do you feel now?
Oh, I'm all right, except for the headache.
Captain, what hit us?
The same thing that blasted the space station, I guess.
It picked us up like a chip of wood in a flash flood.
That it did.
Automatic landing controls must have worked perfectly, or we'd be splattered over 100 acres.
Did you get a report off the base?
No, the radio's knocked out, both transmit and receive.
Captain, are we back on Earth?
Easy enough to find out.
Larry, would you see if the artificial gravity is still working?
- Yeah, it's working.
- Turn it off.
Then we're not on Earth.
I tell you, we're in heaven.
Take a look at that speed indicator.
Over 100 miles a second.
We could have been going twice that fast.
Or 10 times that.
We could be almost anywhere.
What about Mars?
Mars has polar snowcaps.
It also has a surface gravity of 0.38.
We'd all be bouncing around like ping-pong balls.
Why don't we check outside?
I'll break out the pressure suits.
We may not need them.
The gravity is so close to Earth's, the atmosphere should be breathable.
Easy enough to find out.
You're right.
We won't need the pressure suits or the oxygen.
- Got a hunch, Professor?
- Yes, yes, I do.
If it proves to be correct, we will have made the most fantastic voyage in history.
What is it, Doc? Where are we?
Yeah, come on, Doc, give.
I want to be sure.
Captain, I want to explore a bit down there below the snowline.
All right. We'll all go.
About that hunch of yours, Professor, you still got it?
It's no longer a hunch, Captain.
I'm sure.
- We're on the planet Venus.
- What?
At its closest,
Venus is 26 million miles from Earth.
You don't just accidentally land on a planet 26 million miles away.
That's what I would have said, but it appears all things are possible in space.
We don't know how fast we were traveling, nor how long we were unconscious, but of one thing I'm sure, this is Venus.
Yeah, but, Doc, what about all those things we learned at school?
You know, the atmosphere of Venus is supposed to be unbreathable.
The cloud layer's so thick that no light ever gets through.
And with a surface temperature higher than the boiling point of water.
Yes, I know. I subscribe to many of those theories myself.
I even helped formulate some of them.
But it appears
I'm closer to the problem now.
Not a sound.
Not even the hum of an insect.
Is this a dead planet, except for us?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Was that a bird or an animal?
My guess is that was an electronic signal of some kind.
Electronic signal?
Did the hackles cut through the back of my shirt, Mike?
They came up high enough.
Let's get this straight, Doctor.
Electronic signals could only be made by humans.
Not necessarily humans, Neal.
Intelligent beings perhaps, yes, but, who knows what form they may have taken.
It could be insects with tremendous mental powers.
You know, the Doctor's right.
Once I read one of those thriller dollar magazines that told all about the life on the planet Venus.
They had these little bitty guys, about so high.
Green bodies, green blood, heads like king-sized turnips.
They had beautiful eyes, though, waving around on the end of two-foot feelers.
You can see the advantage, Mike.
All they had to do was bend them around behind their head, and they can see what's sneaking up on them.
That sound definitely passed directly over our heads.
Well, there's nothing out there,
I'm happy to report.
I can't stop thinking of Berger and the others on the space station.
All gone.
If one of those weirdies with the floating eyes catches up to us, we'll be gone, too.
You're a cheerful little thing tonight.
Why'd you ever give up that job as master of ceremonies in the Chamber of Horrors?
All right, all right, boys.
- Who'll take the first watch?
- I'll take it.
- I couldn't sleep anyway.
- You got it.
You guys go ahead and sack out.
If I see any of those little green men,
I'll faint.
The sound of my body falling will wake you up.
I wouldn't worry.
The fire ought to keep them away.
How do you know? How do you know?
They might try to come around to get warm.
Just checking. See if you're on your toes.
Good night.
Well, Mike, you've been away from Earth too long.
Hey, you kids play rough.
All right, doll, all right.
- We have found the intruders.
- Good, Bring them in,
We shall do so.
They speak English.
Go! Go! Go!
I believe we'd better accept the invitation.
Yeah, the way those shooting irons of theirs work, I'm with you, Doc.
Well, you heard what the babe said.
Little green men.
I hate them! I hate them!
I hate them! I hate them!
What do you suppose is the matter with her?
I don't know. What's she picking on me for? I didn't do anything.
Go!
- I don't think they like strangers.
- I don't think they like men.
Yeah. Where are the men?
Well, what now?
My guess is they want to look us over.
That's fair enough.
Larry's sure looking them over.
You're not fooling.
How do you like that blonde?
Wow.
Hey, Mike, how'd you like to drag that to the senior prom?
Professor, what do you make of all this?
There's nothing but women.
Perhaps this is a civilization that exists without sex.
You call that civilization?
Frankly, no.
That's the chief?
I am Yllana, ruler of the city of Kadir and queen of this worid.
Why are you here?
We're amazed that you speak our language.
You shouldn't be.
We have monitored your electronic waves for many years.
I see.
I'm Captain Patterson.
This is Professor Konrad,
Lieutenant Turner, Lieutenant Cruze.
We came from Earth on a peaceful missi髇, but our ship was thrown off course, and we crashed here.
This is Venus, is it not?
I believe that is your name for our planet.
If your people will help us repair the damage to our craft, we'll leave as soon as possible.
No, Captain. If we let you go, you will return and make war on us.
That's not true.
The people of Earth have always been aggressive and warlike.
We told you, our missi髇 was a peaceful one.
You betrayed yourselves, Captain.
When my guards found you, your first reaction was to kill.
But we thought we were being attacked.
We were merely defending ourselves.
I do not believe you.
I know how belligerent and quarrelsome you Earthmen are.
The Council will decide your fate.
The men from Earth have had their audience with Yllana.
She sent them to the prison chamber.
- What sort of men are they?
- They seem strong and brave.
Their leader insisted they're on a peaceful missi髇, but Yllana did not believe him.
Do you believe him, Motiya?
His eyes told me he spoke the truth.
I will talk to them.
I must be sure that they can be trusted.
The Council has deliberated.
- lt is our decisi髇 that you lied.
- We told you the truth!
You came here to spy on us, to prepare for invasi髇.
What is the plan of attack?
This is utter nonsense.
There's no plan of attack.
Doctor, you are a man of intelligence.
You must see how futile this stubbornness is.
As a man of science, I assure you,
Earth has never considered Venus to be inhabited, or inhabitable.
Lieutenant Turner?
I haven't heard of any plans.
Why don't you giris knock off all this Gestapo stuff and try to be a little friendly?
You! What have you to say?
Oh, I'm just fine, ma'am.
How's all your folks?
You will die!
But first you will scream for mercy when we force the truth from you.
Take them away!
And I'm the guy that said this was gonna be a lousy milk run.
Very interesting so far.
Be more interesting when we find out what they're going to do with us.
Well, Venus is an awfully nice place to visit, but I certainly wouldn't want to live here.
Not much hope of breaking out.
Surprise one of the guards.
Get a hold of one of those ray guns.
Neal, why do you suppose the queen and her councilors wear those masks?
I'd assume for the same reason that Oriental potentates made their wives wear veils.
Oh, you mean so the hoi polloi can't take a peek.
Something like that.
Brother! They must be knockouts, judging by what there is to see.
Those masked beauties may be knockouts to you, but I have sense of foreboding about them.
A feeling of something monstrous, evil.
So do l.
I didn't say anything to the queen.
I didn't want to put her on guard.
But I'm beginning to think our being here isn't an accident.
I'm afraid I must agree with you.
What's that? What's that?
The ray that destroyed the space station and knocked us off our course may have originated right here.
Oh, come off it.
How could a bunch of women invent a gizmo like that?
Sure, and even if they invented it, how could they aim it?
You know how women drivers are.
I will take that.
Groceries.
Man, they're getting beautifuller and beautifuller.
- The queen wants you to eat.
- Yeah, so we'll eat.
Hey, you know, it's good.
But don't tell me what it is.
Extend our thanks to the queen.
And please ask her to grant us a further discussi髇.
I'm afraid no amount of discussi髇 would help.
Surely, we can make her understand.
But the queen doesn't wish to understand.
She has nothing but hatred in her heart.
Sounds downright subversive.
- Who are you?
- I'm Talleah.
I'm a member of the queen's court.
I came here to tell you that your lives are in great danger.
Maybe I could help.
Fine. We can use a little help, baby.
Hold it. Queen Yllana would kill anyone who tried to help us, wouldn't she?
Yes.
- We can't allow you to risk your life.
- Why not? I'm not alone.
There are many of us who are against the queen's cruelties.
We would like to see her banished.
If you help us, we are going to help you.
I know everything. I heard the verdict.
It's dangerous for you to come here.
I must take that risk and so must you.
Otherwise, the Earth is going to be destroyed.
Earth destroyed? By who?
Yllana and that bunch of masked marvels of hers?
Don't underestimate the queen.
Ten Earth years ago, our worid became involved in war with the planet Mordo.
It was a terrible war.
We fought with weapons of great power, and we still were nearly defeated.
Finally, Mordo was destroyed.
However, the war was won at great cost.
Most of our cities were destroyed, and now they are lost to the jungle.
But what has this to do with Earth?
We suffered greatly.
And that is when we women took over.
Go on.
We were led by a masked woman called Yllana.
Masked? Why?
Nobody seems to know.
You mean, you've never seen her face?
No, but she is said to be very beautiful.
You said Yllana led a revolt?
She said that men caused the ruin of this worid, and it was time for women to take it over.
She became our queen with an absolute power over life and death.
That's incredible.
How did she manage to overthrow the men?
They didn't take her seriously.
They were preparing for war.
After all, she was only a woman.
Well, what happened to them?
To the men.
They're all gone.
You mean, they're all dead?
Not all of them. Some of them she needed.
Scientists, mathematicians.
She banished them to Tyrus, a small satellite that circles Venus.
It became a prison colony.
Then, we're the only men on the whole planet?
Yes.
Wow!
No wonder they locked us up.
Yllana knows that the Earth has been making scientific progress, and she's afraid that they might attack us.
That's why she wants to destroy the Earth.
She must be mad.
She boasts that weapons made by her scientists can destroy the Earth.
The destruction of the space station.
That was the work of one of those weapons?
Yes.
Then Earth may indeed be doomed.
Yeah, if she could knock out the space station the way she did, bam, maybe she could wipe out the Earth.
Yllana sends for you.
I think she wants you, Neal.
Sounds like an invitation to a royal working-over.
- Look, no bunch of dames...
- Turner, don't be a fool.
You heard what that Yllana said she'd do to us?
Yes, I heard what she said.
Also, I watched her.
Believe me, Captain Patterson, she only had eyes for you.
That's it.
Maybe Yllana has more on her mind besides military information.
Neal, why don't you give her the old romance bit?
You know, give her that old black magic.
- Queen Yllana?
- She's a woman, isn't she?
Yes.
Remember the legend of Achilles' heel.
No one, man or woman, is completely invulnerable.
Now listen, skipper, maybe I'm the fellow that ought to have all this romantic razzmatazz.
Sorry, I don't think Yllana's your type.
What do you mean?
If she's a woman, she's my type.
That old stuff again.
How can a doll as cute as that be such a pain in the neck?
All right, Romeo,
I'll give it a whirl if I get the chance.
You know, there's a certain irony in the fact that our lives, and perhaps the lives of everyone on Earth may depend on
Captain Patterson's sex appeal.
If she'd have only picked me.
I'd get her under a tree with a full moon and all that romantic jazz.
Do they have a moon on the planet Venus?
Yes, they have several, but you'll never see them because of the dense cloud cover.
She picked the right guy, don't worry.
I hate her!
I hate that queen!
She's jealous.
26 million miles from Earth, and the little dolls are just the same.
Good evening, Captain Patterson.
Is anything the matter?
Why, no, no.
Bring me a glass of wine, Captain, and one for yourself.
Now, drink with me.
Refreshing, don't you think?
It's distilled from fruits and flowers found nowhere else in the universe.
You're right. It's delicious.
It's exciting and mysterious as Queen Yllana.
I'm sorry my men and l gave the wrong impressi髇, but, a strange new worid, our nerves were on edge.
You needn't bother to explain, Captain.
I understand perfectly.
I hope so. It was scarcely good manners.
You can make your apology sound most convincing.
And, you'll accept it?
Let us say, I'll consider it.
It doesn't depend on your deft phrases and your undeniable charm, Captain, but as I indicated in our first meeting, your common sense.
My common sense?
I mean quite frankly, Captain, if you do not give us a truthful explanation of your visit here, the Council sentence will be carried out to the letter.
I assume you'll weigh the consequences.
But I wonder, have you considered the alternative?
The alternative?
Even a queen can be lonely, Captain.
I've never admitted it until now.
Yllana.
The moment I saw you in the Council chamber,
I felt a weakness most unbecoming to a queen.
But not unbecoming to a lovely woman.
- Take off your mask.
- No.
You're certainly making it difficult.
I can see you are no novice at this, Captain.
Did you promise your men you'd sweep me off my feet?
Use your male magnetism to win freedom for all of you?
Certainly not.
Whatever gave you that idea?
Come, Captain, you don't really hope to deceive me.
We're not fools.
Your space station was an outpost from which you intended to attack us.
How many times must I tell you?
That's not true.
I've warned you, Captain.
You will speak the truth or suffer the consequences.
- What is the plan of attack?
- There is no plan of attack.
Let me show you what happens to those who oppose me.
Look, Captain. The beta disintegrator.
- This is what destroyed the space station.
- Yes.
And it will destroy the Earth just as easily.
But the people, the lives of those countless millions.
I admit the men of Earth have been quarrelsome and foolish in the past, but they mean no harm to your worid.
I swear it.
I understand you better than you do yourself.
You're denying man's love, substituting hatred and a passi髇 for this monstrous power you possess.
Monstrous?
You're not only a queen, you're a woman, too.
And a woman needs a man's love.
Let me see your face.
For that you will die.
I'm sorry, I didn't understand.
Radiation burns. Men did this to me.
Men and their wars.
You say I need the love of a man.
Very well.
Now that you know, will you give me that love, Captain?
- I didn't realize.
- You didn't realize!
Guards! Guards!
It was atomic radiation that disfigured her.
I think it's affected her mind.
And it certainly would account for her hatred of men and wars.
I was clumsy. I should have known.
Don't blame yourself.
No one suspected, not even Talleah.
Just the same, I failed.
It was our last chance.
Well, what are we gonna do, just sit around and wait for those dames to polish us off with the ray guns?
Easy, Mike.
Hey, there's only two of them.
Let's rush them.
- Mike, don't be silly.
- Well, it's better than sitting around, waiting for something to happen.
Come on.
No, No! Friend.
Talleah. Come.
- I was so worried about you.
- We're all right.
These are my friends, Motiya and Kaeel.
They are also your friends.
Hiya, dolls. Glad to have you on our side.
We have no time to waste.
I've found out that the queen plans to destroy the Earth in two days.
Maybe she wasn't bluffing.
Where is the machine?
The beta disintegrator?
It is housed deep in the jungle.
An underground tube runs to it from Kadir, but it is well-guarded.
Then we'll have to go overland.
Can we get out of the city?
It's not going to be easy, but we are going to try it.
Talleah, no need for you and your friends to risk your lives.
It's our fight.
If we can disable the machine, we'll come back to help you.
- But we want to come with you.
- Yes, we want to come with you.
We have no life here without love, children.
All right, you and your friends can come along.
Thank you. Your weapons are here.
We're going to teach you how to use them.
Look in the laboratory.
Take them! Take them! Hide.
Come! Come!
I didn't call for you. What do you want?
You are disturbing my work.
What do you want?
Get out. Get out of here.
You are not needed here.
I ordered, get out!
All exits are sealed.
It's impossible to escape from the palace.
We'll try to fight our way through.
I know a way they may not think of.
Come on.
The Earthmen must be found, and I want them taken alive.
The richest reward to their captors.
No, no, please. No!
This is the traitor who helped the prisoners escape.
No, no, she's mistaken. I swear it, Yllana.
Houdina has always been loyal to her queen.
Release her.
You may go.
It seems
I'm always being forced close to you.
Oh, that's all right.
I'm not the type to complain.
Air Force, you know.
We learn to handle almost any emergency.
Promise you'll stay close to me no matter what happens.
Oh, yes.
Gosh, yes.
Yllana's detection devices are relentless.
Why, they might even track us down by our heartbeats.
Boy, I'm really giving her a target right now.
You're very pretty.
You're handsome.
Is there any special reason for taking your friends along?
Yes, because if we can't change the civilization here,
I thought perhaps we can go someplace and start one on our own.
She's straightforward about it, anyway.
I hope you realize, Captain, this leaves you with a grave responsibility.
Well...
I'm sure that the Captain is dependable in everything.
Looks like we lost them.
I guess we can rest a bit.
They're bombarding us by radar control.
They located us by infrared detection.
Radar can't track us in there.
The metallic streaks on the wall.
You're right, Neal.
No radar impulses can reach us here.
Do you realize that's gold?
The whole planet must be veined with it.
What is so different about gold?
We have much here.
It's incredible.
You know, under other circumstances, this would be so wonderful.
You beside me, watching the fire, the two of us planning the future.
I must admit
I was thinking about the same thing.
But then again, we might have no future at all.
Tell me, Captain, were you happy on your planet?
I was doing work that I liked.
I'd gotten a little recognition.
Yes, I'd say I was pretty content.
Were you really?
No. I hadn't found the girl I wanted, if that's what you're getting at.
I'm glad you said that.
I would be terribly jealous.
Talleah, you're amazing.
Why, you know, on Earth, a girl would rather die than show her real feelings.
We have an old saying,
"A man chases a girl until she catches him."
How silly. What a silly waste of time.
I think if a girl wants a man, she should tell him so.
You're very beautiful, Talleah.
I'm glad you noticed.
It took you such a long time.
I noticed from the first.
And I noticed that I wanted to kiss you from the very beginning.
- Comfortable?
- Yes, very.
- I think the fire's going out.
- No, it isn't.
Oh, the fire.
Larry, get some more wood, will you?
What do you mean,
"Larry, get some more wood"?
What's the matter with,
"Mike, get some more wood"?
This is one time when the seniority really pays off.
Turner, more wood.
Save my place. Yes, sir.
No, I'll get it, Lieutenant.
I'm not busy.
We don't really need any more wood.
Look here!
Guards outside. They found our trail.
No. No use to fight.
They'd simply surround us and starve us out.
They're too many.
How long could we last without food or water?
- You're sure they know we're in here?
- Yes, I'm sure.
- I say let's make a break for it.
- Wait a minute.
- Nobody knows you helped us.
- No.
All right. So far as Yllana's concerned, you're still a loyal subject.
You all are. So loyal, in fact, that you followed us here and recaptured us.
Yes. Of course.
Come on. It has to look good.
March us out.
Come on.
Guards! Help me with the prisoners.
We are going to take the prisoners back to Kadir.
Talleah has recaptured the Earthmen.
We shall return with them immediately.
Talleah has recaptured the fugitives,
Good. Have them taken to my quarters.
Push forward the preparations with all possible speed.
Guards will remain here.
Man, I just aged 10 years out there.
What if those guards had insisted on coming in here with us?
Nice going, Talleah.
I'm disappointed in you, Captain, attempting this foolhardy escape.
You should have known it would be impossible.
Perhaps you would have been more disappointed if I hadn't tried.
Perhaps.
But you'll never get another chance,
I assure you.
I am going to allow myself the exquisite pleasure of watching you while I obliterate the Earth.
Then you will be executed.
Well done, Talleah.
I promised a rich reward for the captor, and you shall have it.
I don't want your reward.
One move, and I kill you.
You're all through. You've had it.
Traitors! You know what this means.
Freedom for our people.
These women aren't alone.
There are thousands like them, desperately wishing for the old order.
And now they're going to have it.
My subjects are grateful to me.
I've kept peace.
Peace is not enough.
They must also be content.
- Women can't be happy without men.
- You're so right, baby.
Do you want to be hated, Yllana?
I don't think you're a tyrant.
I think you're just a woman who's been hurt, hurt so badly you can never repay it.
Is that understanding, Captain, or pity?
Call it what you want.
I'm giving you a chance to save your life.
First, you'll go to that tele-viewer screen of yours and give orders to suspend all work on the beta disintegrator.
I'll give no such orders.
And you will contact the guards on Tyrus and tell them to free all the men.
And if I refuse, Captain?
The alternative wouldn't be a pleasant one.
No, I suppose not.
I've shown no mercy.
I should expect none.
That was a stupid thing to do, Yllana!
You ought to know when you're beaten.
Beaten? You're beaten, Captain.
No one but I can give the orders you want, and I'll die before I give them!
You know, Neal, it sounds like she means it.
That's great, just great!
Is it true?
The orders must come from Yllana?
Yes.
And the orders are going to come from Yllana.
Of course.
I'm going to put on one of her dresses.
Come on, giris. Help me.
I'm sorry.
- We could have ruled this planet together.
- Not your way, Yllana.
You would have done so if I had been as beautiful as Talleah.
- Once I was beautiful.
- Yes. I'm sure you were.
- Tie her up!
- Let me go!
- Put her in back of that screen.
- lt'll be a pleasure.
Let me go!
You're hurting me. Let me go!
Let me go!
You're hurting me. Let me go!
You'll pay for this. You'll all pay!
You look like her twin sister.
Disguised like that, you can take us right to the machine, give us our chance to destroy it.
Are any of the personnel at the disintegrator base loyal to you?
-10 or even more.
- We'll need them.
You better go ahead and tell them that we are coming.
Alert them to help us if necessary.
We'll do our best.
No, that way.
We may not have a chance to talk later.
We may not even live through the day.
I just want to say while I have the chance,
I love you.
Love. I've almost forgotten, but if it is that warm feeling that makes my heart sing, then l, too, love you.
We must hurry. We have no time to lose.
Don't forget. We're your prisoners.
Get rid of those guns.
Yllana!
Get out! I didn't send for you.
What are you looking for?
You're disturbing me.
Traitor.
Now don't jump to conclusions.
Please!
Now, if you'll just give me a second
- I can explain.
- Silence, man.
So, the beautiful, loyal Talleah.
- Let me kill her now.
- No, not yet.
They shall die. Talleah, Motiya, all of them, but not until they've witnessed my greatest triumph.
For her treachery, Talleah will die last, and most horribly of all.
I could spare your life.
I must say, this baby looks like it can do it.
Yes.
I believe they've solved the problem of projecting nuclear energy.
You will be interested to hear that the weapon will be ready to fire in a few minutes.
Well, Captain, no comments?
I think you're out of your mind.
A person like you must appreciate this achievement, Professor.
One touch of a tiny red button, and Earth will become a wasteland, and the mountains will crumble into dust.
It's monstrous.
Will nothing keep you from going through with this?
Nothing, Professor!
You disappoint me.
I thought you would be fascinated.
Many would envy you this privilege,
Professor.
If you've got a crazy notion to blast somebody, blast us.
In due time, Lieutenant. In due time.
Look! Over there!
My electronic telescope makes every detail clear.
It took untold millions of years to create the planet you call Earth.
Watch it closely, Earthmen.
It will be destroyed in a matter of seconds.
Watch it!
And now the brave men who have helped us to get back our freedom and our happiness are about to depart.
Their ship has been repaired, and there is nothing that stands in their way to go back to their own planet.
If you must go, promise me you're going to come back to me.
I don't want to go, Talleah, believe me.
I want to stay here with you.
But, Larry, you said you loved me.
Oh, baby, I do, I do.
These past few days have been wonderful.
I mean, getting to know you and all.
Can't you delay your departure a day or two?
I'm sorry. No.
- Where's Larry?
- Where else?
Larry.
I gotta go. I'll be back as soon as I can.
- I was just being polite to the girl.
- Sure, sure.
Come on. We have to get going.
You're going to come back to me.
The electronic tele-viewer is working.
Earth answers us.
Wonderful!
My orders to Captain Patterson are not to attempt a return flight in the Starfire.
I will not risk his life or the lives ofhis men in a patched-up ship,
Therefore, Captain, you and your crew will remain on the planet Venus until a relief expedition can reach you,
I know you men are anxious to return home,
Colonel, are you kidding?
But you must bear your privations and your hardships bravely,
Hardships? Oh, I will, Colonel.
I will. Bravely. Yes, sir.
It may be a year or more before we can get to you,
You had your technicians working day and night.
You arranged this whole...
A year.

Come in, Mrs. Sugrue.
Katie, darlin'.
Can you lend me the loan of a small pinch of tea?
I'll pay you back Thursday.
You can have it and welcome.
I knew you wouldn't refuse old Sheelah, and I knew you'd have rations and leavings, for there's little that's lacking here, unless 'twould be a man to cook for.
I have me father to cook for.
So you do, so you do, but I meant a man of your own.
- Time enough for that.
- "Time enough" lost the ducks.
There's many a lass that lost her market from waiting too long.
Oh, you can smile now, but who in this town would have you?
- Am I that bad?
- You miss the meaning.
There's not a man doesn't want you, but who among them dare look at you with the grand house you live in?
A fine situation your father has with his lordship.
Take my son Pony.
He don't dare raise his eyes to you, and him the catch of the town.
Now, I would have said that Pony thought no small beer of himself.
Oh, he's proud.
He's proud as a white-washed pig, but he needs encouragement from you.
You should be looking ahead, Katie.
Your father is getting no younger, and when the time comes that he must step down... who else will there be but Pony
Sugrue who can take his place?
Don't put me father in his grave just yet.
Oh, the saints forbid.
He'll be spared for many years,
God willin'.
[Skipped item nr. 32]
(hoofbeats)
That must be Pony now.
No, it's not.
Merciful heavens!
It's Lord Fitzpatrick himself.
Hello, Katie.
Your Lordship, why didn't you tell us you were coming?
I'd have opened the manor house for you.
I'll not be stopping here long enough for that.
Where's your father?
Well, now, let me see.
Um...
I heard him sayin', um, something about cuttin' the weeds around the summer house.
I think he'll have gone to have the smithy sharpen his scythe.
- I'll fetch him for you, Your Lordship.
- Well, that's good of you.
That Katie's a grand girl.
Almost makes up for her father.
- What ails him?
- Oh, nothing at all, but he retired about five years ago, didn't tell me about it.
He'll be down at the inn now, telling stories.
Well, let's go and have a look at the gatehouse.
Oh, I didn't know anybody was here.
I'm the Widow Sugrue,
Your Lordship.
- I often comes in to help.
- I see.
Begging Your Lordship's pardon,
I'm the mother of Pony Sugrue.
He drives the mail cart to Cahersiveen whenever the train comes in.
I'm very glad to hear it.
He's a fine strong lad.
He's worthy of greater things.
- Is he, now?
- Aye, he is indeed.
You'll never hear me speak a word against Darby O'Gill, but he's gettin' on.
When the time comes for you to hire a younger man, give a thought to m'lad Pony.
I'm not sure I want a man who is too well known to the town.
A man from outside would be more respected.
My Pony is respected and feared, too.
He's whipped every man in the parish.
Is that so?
Thank you. Thank you.
If it were Pony you had in charge of this place, he wouldn't let it fall to wrack and ruin whilst he sat in the pub telling stories.
Well, I'll tell you, the first look
I got at him was in the old ruins
- on the top of Knocknasheega.
- And what did he look like, Darby?
Ah, just like any other leprechaun, only he, being king of them all, had a little gold crown on his head.
Tell me something, Darby.
Did he have a long tail and a cloven hoof?
Now, whoever heard of a leprechaun havin' a...
(laughter)
You don't have to listen if you don't want to, Pony, but you needn't make fun of those who do.
But I do.
I want to listen.
I want to learn all about them.
Here, Molly, give me another large one, and then maybe I can see a leprechaun, too.
You'll get no more whiskey here today, but if you care to be sociable, you can have a glass of stout.
I ordered whiskey, and devil a foot will I stir from here until I get it.
Pony Sugrue, you're bloom old and for want of a beatin', and if I were 10 years younger,
I'd give it to you.
Ah, but you're... you're not
10 years younger, are you?
No, I'm not, but this is my place, and while you're in the Rathcullen
Arms, you'll sit quietly, or I'll have Father Murphy forbid you to come here at all.
All right, I'll have the stout.
You were sayin', Darby?
I was sayin' this wasn't like any old leprechaun that you wouldn't say hello twice to.
But who was he... but Brian Connors himself, the king of them all.
But I got me eye fixed on him.
They can't escape, you know, as long as you don't look away.
Now, the night was dark and the mountain was covered with mist, and the moon was no bigger than the light from a wee penny candle, but it didn't hide him from me... for there he stood, with an angry little gob on him and his face as fierce as fire.
King Brian, me old boyo,
I've got you at last, and I'm not gonna let you go until you grant me the favor of three grand wishes.
Wait now, wait now, maybe we can talk this over.
- Will you have a pinch of snuff?
- Aye, and you'll blow it into me eyes.
I'm up to all your dirty little tricks.
You've gone too far. You'll get no wishes from me at all, now.
You'll either give them to me, or else you'll answer to the Church.
I'll have Father Murphy curse you with a blessin' that'll shrivel you up in a minute.
All right, then, wish your wishes and be done with it.
I've work to do at home.
- Ah, don't rush me.
- Don't rush you? Huh.
Mean to say you're not gonna wish for a crock of gold?
I may in due time, but what's gold to a man if he be too sick or too sad to enjoy it?
Ah, you're the thinkin' man.
I am, and me first wish is you'll grant me health.
- Granted.
- Now, me second wish is a small wish indeed, but it means a lot to me.
- I want a big crop of potatoes.
- Granted.
And me third wish is for the crock of gold.
Granted.
Now, what about your fourth wish?
Me fourth wish?
Try me.
You'll find I'm a generous man.
Then I'll be a generous man.
I'd like a crock of gold like this for me good friend Tom Kerrigan and another one for that decent man Pat Scanlon and another one for that doorful of a woman, Molly Malloy.
- Is that your fourth wish?
- It is.
(laughing)
Three wishes I'll grant you, great wishes or small, but you'll wish a fourth one, and you'll lose them all!
(laughing)
Wasn't I the fool of the world, lettin' him trick me into the fourth wish, and me knowin' better.
Ah, dear, dear, and we could all have been as rich as Midas himself.
- A whole crock of gold for me.
- The devil's gold.
I wouldn't touch it if Father Murphy blessed every coin.
Stay away from Knocknasheega, Darby.
You moil and meddle with that little king, he'll put the come-hither on you and make you his slave forevermore.
Do you think I'm a babe in arms?
You are to the likes of him.
5,000 years old, he is, and every year of his life he's learned a new trick.
And I've learned 100 of them.
You're mad, mind you. You'll be caught like a rat in a snap trap.
Now, I don't want your blood on my head, so don't wish any gold for me.
I'll leave your share to the Church, Paddy,
(laughs) but I won't let Father Murphy know where I got it.
- No, no.
- (laughter)
(Father Murphy)
God save all here.
We didn't see you, Father.
I didn't want to interrupt.
I just dropped in to tell you the news.
My friend Father O'Leary in the town of Glencove has a new bell that was given to him by Lord Bellinbergh, and he has presented the old one to us.
- Ah, that's grand, Father.
- Glory be.
There'll be a chapel bell in our tower at last.
All we have to do is to go after it.
Now, if I had a horse, which I haven't,
I'd go for it meself, which I won't, but I thought perhaps there might be somebody here with a horse and cart who'd like to go for the bell.
How much would that somebody be paid, Father?
Paid?
I suppose we might be able to scratch up two pounds.
Now, I would've said it was worth two pounds, 10, if it was worth a bob.
Like enough it's worth three pounds, but since we're a poor parish,
I thought perhaps you might like to take out the difference in the credit to your soul.
Two pounds, 10, Father.
Why, my goodness me, a deed like that might even absolve a man from the sin of using the priest and the Church against the powers of darkness for his own selfish ends.
I'll do it, Father.
I'll do it for nothing.
No. As a reward, you may have the music of the bell.
- The music of the bell for me?
- Yes, and for your seed, breed and generation till the end of time.
It's a bargain, Father.
I'll do it in the morning.
Father!
Savin' your presence, Father Murphy, but he's needed at the house.
Excuse me, Your Reverence.
- Fitzpatrick himself...
- Don't worry about me, girl.
I'll get back.
I'm coming now.
What are you after doin' pulling me out, with Father Murphy lookin' at us, neither?
I can't afford an army of caretakers for the little use I have of the place, but I don't like to see the weeds higher than the summer house.
Someone's after poaching rabbits.
Ah, that's a thing
I want you to put a stop to.
Old Darby couldn't catch a poacher if he tried.
Like enough he helped to set the snare.
Now, I don't want any bad feeling between the townspeople and me.
I like 'em, mind you, and so will you,
- but don't like 'em too much.
- No, sir. No poachers.
Well, well, well, sir.
I never thought I'd have the pleasure of seeing Your Lordship so soon.
Yes, it looks as if you weren't quite ready for me.
One more day, and I'll have the whole place beautified.
Darby, this is Michael MacBride, a Dublin man.
I've decided to settle him here in your place.
I know it sounds sudden, but I've had it in mind for some time.
You've served me well, Darby, but we need a younger man here.
When a man gets along in years, he shouldn't have to work so hard, so I'm going to retire you on half pay, let you have the old McCarthy cottage rent-free for the rest of your days.
And leave the gatehouse?
It's become our home.
Well, so will the other in time.
- I don't think Katie will take to this.
- We'll give it a new thatch.
But what am I going to do with meself, and me cut off in me prime?
You'll be telling stories at the public house all day, and poaching rabbits by night.
Holy old Finbar!
What with the foxes eatin' the grouse, don't tell me I set a snare down a rabbit hole.
You're an old fox yourself, Darby, but, faith, I'm fond of you and Katie, too.
Whenever we have to open up the manor house, she can have first call with the cleaning.
Pardon me, sir, but when have we got to leave the gatehouse?
Can we give them another two weeks?
Longer than that, sir, as far as I'm concerned.
Good. Then tonight, when you finish today's work here, you tell Tom Kerrigan to let you have a room at the Rathcullen Arms.
Please, sir, I'd be grateful if you wouldn't mention it to Katie.
I want to break the news to her meself.
Very well, but remember I said two weeks, Darby, not two years.
When I return here on Monday week,
I want you out and Michael in and everything settled and done.
Yes, sir.
Good day, Your Lordship!
Well, goodbye, Mr. O'Gill.
Now here, wouldn't it be a shame to put his lordship to the expense of a room in the pub and Katie and me fair rockin' around in the gatehouse?
That's very kind of you, but I don't think his lordship would like it.
Why wouldn't he? Sure I can instruct you on your new duties. Katie!
Yes, Father?
- This is Mister, uh...
- MacBride.
Mr. MacBride is comin' to stay with us for a while, so throw some extra spuds in the pot for supper and make up the bed in the loft.
If it's any trouble, I can go to the inn.
It's no trouble at all.
Pony!
- Come with me.
- What's up with you now?
I want you outside where his lordship can have a look at you.
Why should he want a look at me?
'Cause you're going to be a consequential man and have Darby's fine position as his lordship's caretaker and Katie O'Gill for your wife.
Huh, and when the sky falls, we'll all catch larks.
I mean it, Pony. I had a talk with his lordship about you, and I tell you it's only a matter of time.
I put a flea in Katie's ear, too.
I wouldn't worry about her.
With a fine situation like that,
I could have me choice of girls.
Katie might help you get it.
- Maybe you're right.
- Here he comes.
Smile, me darling.
Smile.
This is m'lad Pony, Your Lordship, the one I told you about.
Your servant, sir.
Well, he's a big man, isn't he, now?
Nice to meet you, Pony.
(clears throat)
"A big man," says he.
What did I tell you?
You'll get the job in no time at all.
Ah, Katie, you should have saw the turf the two of us cut this afternoon.
That was a grand bit of work you done. So it was, aye.
His lordship thought I could use a lad to help with the turf before the rains came.
And me doin' 10 men's work already.
Come, lad, sit down.
Take the air of the fire, and I'll play you a tune while the pot's on the boil.
(# plucks strings)
Ah, that's good.
(# playing lively tune)
- Can you put a name to that?
- Hmm? Uh, no, it's... it's new to me.
What's it called?
Them as I heard it from give it no name.
Well, where did you hear it?
In the old ruins on the top of Knocknasheega, and there were the little people dancing all around in the moonlight.
Well, aren't they the bold creatures?
Aye, they are.
Supper's ready.
Bold and cunning, they are, but I'm up to them.
Once I caught King Brian himself, and he gave me the gold, though I'd no need for it.
But, faith, I have need for it now.
Shh.
(whispers)
Don't breathe a word.
Tomorrow at dawn I've got to go to Glencove to bring back a bell for the chapel.
I'll have to round up the horse, now, before she runs all over the mountainside.
I'll be glad to give you a hand.
I was just going to ask you to go the rounds of the manor house and try all the doors and the windows.
Right so, but after that, I think I'll go down to the Rathcullen Arms and see about a room.
Now, why would you be doin' that?
I don't like to take hospitality under false pretenses, and besides, two weeks from today, you must leave here.
- I think your daughter should know.
- Oh, she will, she will.
Then why let her believe that I was brought here only for the cuttin' of the turf?
You see, she was born in the gatehouse, and for 20 years, she's lived in it.
It gives us a standin' in the town.
No, I'll tell her when the time comes.
I can't break it out of a clear sky like a crack of thunder.
Well, when will you tell her?
- The first good chance I get.
- Then do it soon.
I'll tell her, I'll tell her.
Here, I'm used to the dark.
- Watch out for poachers.
- I'll do that.
Come on now, Cleopatra.
Wait now, darlin'.
Devil take you!
Come back here!
Come back to your master.
Wait till I catch you.
Cleopatra, come on, now.
Cleopatra, where are you?
I'm lookin' for you.
Can't you hear me?
Cleopatra.
Ah, there you are.
What do you think you're doin'?
Hop out of that.
Do you want to break a leg?
Whoa! Whoa, there.
Whoa! Whoa, I tell you.
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa, there.
Whoa!
Get down! Whoa!
- (neighing)
- Get down!
(screaming)
- So that's Darby O'Gill, is it?
- Aye, it is.
I wonder why his honor put the come-hither on the likes of that.
Sure there's no more life in him than a potato vine after a frost.
Well, either he's hard asleep or he's killed entirely.
Let's find out.
(grunts)
You murderin' little heathens!
- Watch your stick.
- Oh! Hey! Get off me!
Wait, wait.
Hey! Ooh!
(laughing)
(grunting, groaning)
Come on, you blackguard, now we'll take you to the king.
There's no tellin' what he'll do to you.
No tellin' indeed.
(laughs)
(# bagpipes and drums playing)
- Come on.
- Hurry up!
Darby O'Gill is here.
He's come.
(music stops)
Come in, man.
Come in.
All right,
Your Royal Highness.
Well, Darby O'Gill, 'tis pleased and delighted I am to see you again.
Thank you, sir.
It's a grand place you got here.
Ah, it does well enough.
Sit down, man.
Over there.
Drop the lid, man.
It's only an old chest full of jewels.
We took it from the Spanish ships when the Armada
- was wrecked on our coast.
- Is that so?
Ship's gun, too.
Oh, that's a fine piece.
- It is indeed.
- And the throne?
By all the goats in Kerry, do you think I'd sit on a Spanish throne?
This once belonged to Fergus mac Leda, ancient high king of all Ireland.
- Do you say so?
- I do.
And over there, the gold cup of Cormac.
And here's the sword of Brian Boru, who drove out the Danes.
And over there you see the harp.
Don't tell me it's "the harp that once through Tara's Hall the soul of music shed."
Aye, it is that same.
I declare to me soul, when I tell them this down in the pub, they won't believe a word of it.
Ah, you can't do that, Darby.
Once you're here, there's no going back.
I've got to get back to Katie.
Ah, you needn't worry about Katie.
She'll give you a grand wake, and then she'll forget all about you.
- Mind what you say about Katie.
- Calm yourself, now. Calm yourself!
- What have I ever done to you?
- Nothin', Darby.
- Who tells all the stories about you?
- You do, Darby.
Aye, and who makes the women watch where they're throwin' their wash water when you and your lads are out walkin' invisible?
You do, Darby.
And who makes the men tip their hats respectful to every swirl of dust?
You.
You've done grand.
So you put the come-hither on me.
That's how you pay me back, you ungrateful little frainey.
Your heart's as cold as a wet Christmas.
(shouting)
Blackguard!
They better watch what they're saying. I speak Gaelic, too.
- Now, you listen to me.
- No, you listen to me.
Phadrig Oge was standing under the white thorn tree by the summer house when his lordship gave you the bad news today, and the moment
I heard you were in trouble,
I swore I'd take you out of it.
If you're the fine, decent man
I think you are, you'll be showin' me a little bit of gratitude.
I am grateful.
Then you can say goodbye to the tears and the troubles of the world outside. There's nothin' but fun and diversion here.
Now, what'll you do first, Darby?
- Well, I don't know.
- Would you care to play the harp?
No, I'm no great hand with the harp... but give me me old fiddle, and I'll play you a tune
- worth goin' a mile o' ground to hear.
- Grand.
Now, if someone will show me the way out, I'll go home for it.
None of your tricks, Darby.
I said you were here to stay.
Phadrig Oge!
- Yes, Your Highness?
- Fetch the Stradivarius.
Right away, Your Highness.
It was presented to me by the emperor of the Italian fairies in 1700.
It's a Stradivarius.
I'd rather have me own.
Ah, you'll have to make do with this one.
Go ahead, man.
Try it.
All right, then, if it makes you happy.
(# playing sad tune)
- Now give us a good one.
- All right, then.
Me grandfather Podge told me there were three things the little people were mad after:
Dancin', whiskey and huntin'.
Begorra!
He wasn't far wrong.
Then I'll give you the fox chase.
- (crowd murmuring)
- Ah, the fox chase.
First you'll hear the gathering of the huntsmen
- and the bayin' of the hounds.
- Grand.
Away we go.
(# playing lively tune)
(# playing faster)
(# playing faster)
(# playing faster)
(laughing)
Ooh!
(horn sounding)
Gone away!
(laughing)
Give us full cry!
(laughing)
(King Brian) A-ridling!
Oscul!
A-ridling!
Wait!
Wait, Your Highness. Wait!
(whinnies)
Whose side are you on, anyway?
You'll find out who's the knowledgeable one.
Come on, now.
Oh, it's not for me.
I'm expectin' company.
If I can only hold him here till cockcrow, you'll see what'll happen to your friend when daylight comes. Aye.
(door banging)
And... And how was the chase, hm?
We were chasin' the wrong fox, but I've run you to earth at last.
What do you mean, sir?
- I've a good mind to break your back!
- I thought we were friends.
You've made a laughingstock of me in front of my own people!
- I don't understand.
- When his lordship kicked you out,
- who took you in?
- You did.
And what did you do the minute my back was turned?
Oh, I-I just went back for me pipe.
You didn't think I wanted to stay here, did you?
How could any man who's had one look inside the fairy mountain be content with anything else?
Faith, I never saw dancin' so fine or heard pipin' so shockin' sweet or touched a fiddle so grand, and never in me wildest dreams did I dream I'd be sittin' on diamonds.
No, indeed.
All I want from here is me old duidin.
Well, you better make sure.
We can't have you goin' in and out.
No, not a thing else.
- I'll not even be needin' this.
- And what might that be, now?
It's a drop of old poteen
I found in the bog.
Oh, it has a real smack to it.
I'd offer you a drop, only it wouldn't be fine enough for Your Royal Highness.
Let me be the judge of that.
Well, very good,
Your Royal Highness.
Well, here goes.
Ahh.
It drinks cool and easy, so it does.
I'm plenty glad you like it.
Now we'd better be on our way.
I can't wait to get back to all that music and fun and diversion.
Now, just a minute.
We've a fine bit of diversion right here.
Sit down now and have one with me for friendship's sake.
Well, if you insist,
Your Royal Highness...
- I'll join you.
- Good man, yourself, and if it's music you're after, what about a song?
- A song?
- Aye.
- Do you know the "Wishing Song"?
- I do not.
Oh, we better not try it, then.
You have to make it up as you go.
(laughs) I can make up a thousand songs, so I can.
Can you?
- Of course I can.
- All right, then.
The "Wishing Song."
# Oh, I wish I had time to sing you a song
# But when I get started,
I sing all night long
- (laughs)
- Ha.
Can you put a rhyme to that?
- Try me.
- Go on, then.
# Oh, singin's no sin and drinkin's no crime
# If you have one drink only, just one at a time
(Darby laughs)
# Oh, I wish all the rhymers were like Brian Connors
# When it comes to rhymin', he takes all the honors
(Darby laughs)
(laughing)
- Can you beat that?
- Hold your whisht.
# Oh, I knew you could sing when you opened your mug
# So you carry the tune and I'll carry the jug
That's a good one.
Could we have another round?
- There's nothin' stoppin' us.
- Good.
# Oh, I wish all barmaids
# Were like Mary McCluskey
"McCluskey"?
# When she served you a drink
# Why, she served you good "whuskey"
(laughing)
Oh, that's a thunderin' good rhyme,
"McCluskey" and "whuskey."
Did you ever hear the like of it?
# But Mary, she married poor Jimmy McQueen
# 'Cause she wanted her name to rhyme with "poteen"
- Oh, I've got a good one.
- So have I.
# Oh, I wish I was married to old Widow Tunney
# She's ugly as sin but has beautiful money
- Slainte, lad.
- Slainte go saol agat.
(laughing)
(groaning)
(both continue laughing)
(snores)
(# King hums the "Wishing Song")
How many verses have we sung?
- Well, here's the 80th for you.
# Oh, I wish that all mortals were like my friend Darby
# He's full of poteen, but he's fuller of blarney
(laughing)
- That's a tough one.
- (King laughs)
- Well, here's 81.
- Ha! Ha! Ugh!
# I wish all the gentry were like the King Brian
# If he can't beat ya drinkin',
# He'll fall down a-tryin'#
(both laughing)
(roostercrows)
(laughing)
Good mornin', me old bucko.
(laughing)
Open your door.
Can you not go through it anymore?
Try again.
Would you violate the sacred rites of hospitality?
I would.
How would you like to have me put a lump on your back?
I know you can't work your charms in the daytime, and when you couldn't go through that door, I knew I had you.
You murderin', deceitful, blind-staggerin' old truaillidh moran!
When me strength comes back in the nighttime,
I'll put an elephant's head on you and have you crawl on all fours and eat grass that won't nourish you
- till you shrivel up and die!
- Whoo-hoo, hullabaloo!
(cat meows)
Ah, good mornin', Ginger.
Have you come for your breakfast?
Well, there's a tasty morsel
I've no further use for.
Don't let him loose.
Don't let him loose!
Shrivel him up.
Put a hump in his back.
Have mercy, Darby.
Spare me and I'll grant you your three wishes all over again!
Do you hear that, Ginger?
Now, go on, wish them.
Sure now, I might wish for the crock of gold.
- Go on!
- Or I might wish for... let's see...
- Long life.
- Yes.
Or I might wish for a carriage and pair.
- Granted. Granted.
- (Ginger meowing)
Granted!
But I haven't wished a wish yet.
I said I might.
Get on with it, then.
Wish your wishes, and since we've had such a grand night of it, you can have as many as you like.
So that's good of you.
"Three wishes I'll grant you, big wishes and small, but if you wish a fourth, you'll get none at all."
(laughing)
Ah, what a memory you've got, you wicked old scut.
(laughing)
But before I make a wish,
I'll have to talk with Katie.
- I'll make one.
- Go on, go on.
One wish to protect the other two.
Now, me first wish is that you will not fly back to Knocknasheega, but you'll be at my beck and call for a fortnight at least, until I make the other two wishes.
You thief of the world.
Never in 1,000 years has a man taken such an underhanded advantage.
Faith, never in 5,000 years have you ever met a more knowledgeable adversary.
I am Brian of Knocknasheega, and never...
No! No!
Do you agree to the terms of the first wish?
I do, I do!
All right, then.
Go on, Ginger.
But how am I gonna protect myself while you're makin' up your mind?
Now, don't worry.
I'll take good care of you.
Aah!
No, no, no, you wicked old devil.
You murderin' old hypocrite!
Let me go! Let me out!
(muffled)
Let me out, do you hear me?
Now, what would she be doin' around here?
Always scroogin' round to the back door, beggin' something, borrowin' tea or something.
- Morning.
- Good morning.
- Did you sleep well?
- That I did, thank you.
Where's Darby?
His bed hasn't been slept in, but he'll turn up.
I gathered from something he said last night that he might capture the leprechaun.
- He has great games with them.
- When he's taken a draft too many?
He's not a drinkin' man.
But he's a lonely man since me mother died.
When he goes to the pub, it's for company, and when he makes his rounds at night, the wee folk give him sport.
Well, what about yourself?
Don't you get lonely?
I keep busy.
Rathcullen's a small, little place, but there are dances and hostings aplenty.
There's a dance on tonight.
Maybe you'd care to go,
Mr. MacBride?
No, not yet, thank you.
And, uh, by the way, my name is Michael.
Well, so it is, but until I've known you more than a day, your name is Mr. MacBride...
Mr. MacBride.
What was old Sheelah doin' around here?
She dropped in to pay back a pinch of tea.
Well, I don't like to see her about the place.
- Father, sit down and eat.
- She and her son Pony, they're two of a kind, neither of them up to any good.
She's only a poor old woman.
Old woman indeed.
Are you wearin' your holy medal?
- I am.
- Well, don't leave it off.
- She could be a witch.
- You'd better go to bed.
I can't. I got to go to Glencove to pick up a bell for Father Murphy.
'Tis a shame I'll not be here today to help you.
Oh, we can't let the cutting of the turf stand in the way of good deeds.
Well, me boy, seein' it's for one day only, could you leave the turf and cut the weeds around the summer house?
- I think I could.
- And, listen, if you make a good job of it,
I might keep you on.
How would you like workin' for me, anyway?
Why would he want to work for you?
You haven't one shilling to rub against the other.
Katie, me dear, there's been a change in our fortunes for the better.
I'm thinkin' of buyin' the manor house for meself and shiftin' you out of here into surroundin's more in keepin' with your charm and beauty.
Well, I wouldn't want to live in the manor house.
You know as well as I do, his lordship would never sell it.
What do you want?
You've only got to name it.
I don't want anything.
Now, sit down.
I suppose you don't want to hear about the great battle
I fought with the powers of darkness.
I do not.
Now, sit down and eat your stirabout.
She should be the caretaker.
She's got a tongue would clip a hedge.
(Michael) # Have you ever seen the sea gulls
# A- flyin' o'er the heather
# Or the crimson sails in Galway Bay
# The fishermen unfurl
# Oh, the earth is filled with beauty
# And it's gathered all together
# In the form and face and dainty grace
# Of a pretty Irish girl
# Oh, she is my dear my darlin' one
# Her eyes so sparklin' full of fun
# No other, no other can match the likes of her
# She is my dear my darlin' one
# My smilin' and beguilin' one
# I love the ground she walks upon
# My darling Irish girl
I called you when your food was ready, but you were makin' so much noise, you couldn't hear me.
Faith, I know I can't sing a lick, but when I'm roarin' like Doran's bull, it works up a killin' hunger in me.
What have we got here?
Bread newly baked, butter fresh from the churn, and boiled eggs and ham.
Well, now, aren't you the clever girl?
You have enough here to feed the parish.
I thought you'd be hungry.
- I hope the bread has cooled.
- Oh, I like it hot.
Mile murder! Did no one ever tell you the hazard of hot bread?
No, they didn't, ah...
Sure you can see I need someone to watch over me.
Did your father say anything this morning before he left?
He said he would be back by sundown.
Nothin' about me?
- He said you were a good lad.
- That's all?
- Isn't that enough?
- I suppose it is.
Tell me, Katie, do you think I'm a good lad?
I very greatly doubt it.
(bell chiming)
(cheering)
Aye, you look fine, Darby!
Hey, all right!
It's a grand bell.
You've done a great deed.
Thank you, Father.
Thank you, Father.
Darby!
- What have you got in the bag?
- Well, uh, Father, it would be a hard thing to explain.
Oh, now, you could try.
Well, like, it's a kind of financial venture, you might say.
A financial venture that you'd be afraid to tell your priest about?
Oh, no, no, no.
Sure I'm on the side of the angels, against the powers of darkness.
What would you say,
Father, if I told you
I captured the king of the little people?
I'd say you had imagined it.
Ha-ha. Then I've nothin' at all in the bag here, Reverend.
Nothin' at all.
(laughing)
(cheering)
Glory be to the saints of joy.
This is a great day for Rathcullen.
You've certainly earned a glass of stout, Darby.
Aye, it's dry work cartin' a bell.
May we all live to see...
- Would a toast be a kind of wish?
- It would.
Oh, well, then, devil a toast will I drink this day.
What's in there?
The renowned Brian Connors, king of all the leprechauns.
One wish I wished already, but I'm not lettin' him out of this bag until I've wished the other two.
What does he look like, Darby?
Ah, just a teeny-weeny tawny little atom-y kind of gentleman with a beard on his face and a crown like a fistful of horns on his head.
Let's have a look at him, Darby.
Let's have a look at the little gentleman.
Oh, never mind, then.
Sure it's only
Lady Fitzpatrick's prize hen, the one they gave the red ribbon to at the fair.
(imitating chickens clucking)
Fill the little pannikin, 20 year old, the best in the house.
I will, Darby.
Thank you.
Here you are, Your Majesty.
(gulping noise)
(King Brian) Ah.
- Did you see that?
- I saw it with me own two eyes.
Give me the glass, Tom.
That's a story will bear repeatin'.
And if any man doubts the truth of it, there's the very same glass.
# Bum-ba-dum-ba-da-da-dee-dee
# Da-dum-ba-da-da-da-dun
# When the dew is on the hayrick
# And every drop a pearl
# When the geese are full of blarney
# And the thrush is singing Gaelic
# And standing in the doorway
# Is a pretty Irish girl
# Oh, she is my dear my darling one
# Her eyes so sparkling full of fun
# No other, no other can match the likes of her
# She is my dear my darling one
# My smilin' and beguilin' one
# I love the ground she walks upon...
- Now, where did you hear that?
- Michael was singin' it.
# My pretty Irish girl #
- Where are you off to?
- To a dance.
With Michael?
No. Michael's goin' your rounds for you.
He is?
Why'd he do that?
Well, he said you were worried about the poachers.
If I hurry, I'll catch up with him.
- Ah, the devil take you!
- Darby!
What ails you, lad?
Is it blind you are?
I am indeed. Sure when I saw man running in the dark with a game bag in his hand, wasn't I the foolish one to mistake him for a poacher?
By the hokey, it did look bad.
Will you forgive me?
Faith, a stepmother wouldn't blame ye.
No harm done.
I'm sorry, but I promised his lordship there'd be no poaching, and I can't make an exception, not even for you,
- so you'll have to let the rabbit go.
- Rabbit indeed.
(laughing)
I didn't intend to show him yet, but you've been a nice fella.
I'll give you the first look.
Bring him over here. Come on.
Get ready for the grand surprise.
It's no rabbit.
- Rabbit or hare, what's the odds?
- Rabbit or hare?
You're lookin' at Brian of Knocknasheega,
- king of all the leprechauns.
- 'Twas a rabbit I saw.
Have another look.
It's still a rabbit.
- Try closin' one eye.
- Closing one eye?
Ah, you've had a hard day today, and a hard night last night.
Now, why don't you go home to bed and get a good rest?
How could I rest, and you thinkin' I'm a poacher?
They take different shapes, you know?
So I hear.
Aye, you ought to see him with his little gold crown and his red beard and his two eyes leapin' from his head like flames.
- I wish you could see him.
- Granted.
And that's your second wish.
Why, you tricky, deceivin', connivin', double-dealin',
- high-handed...
- Oh, wirra, wirra, wirra.
That's what comes of a man not yet threescore and 10 matchin' his wits against an intellectual gladiator 5,000 years old.
Well, I still have me third wish left, and maybe me second one's not all wasted.
Now, go on.
Make yourself visible to him.
But I am visible to him.
You wished he should see me, and see me he does.
- He sees me as a rabbit.
- You're a cheat and you're a liar.
- Don't tell me you can't hear him.
- I'm afraid I can't.
What's the world comin' to?
I could have knocked a crock of gold out of this old chancer with that second wish, but I gave it all up for a man who can neither hear nor see.
Darby, he can see me as I really am... in his dreams tonight.
You can see him tonight in your dreams.
Are you sure?
I am.
He promised me.
Ah, the last reel was the best one.
You know, Katie, you're so light on your feet, you could tread on cobwebs without breaking them.
- Thank you, Sean.
- May I take you home now?
No need to trouble yourself.
Katie can ride home with me.
- I think it...
- Can't she?
That'll be grand, Pony.
- Good night, Sean.
- Good night, Katie.
(clicks tongue)
Come on. Hup! Hup!
Thank you for the ride.
Good night, Pony.
Have you no pride, ridin' home with the like of that?
He was only bein' civil to me, and I was no more than civil to him.
Well, you'd better forget about him altogether.
Well, maybe I will... when me father stops spyin' on me at windows.
Oh, tare and ages!
Isn't that a nice way for a girl to talk to her father?
And she me one and only.
She's a fine girl, Katie, but she's in mortal danger.
- How do you mean that?
- 'Tis you, the way you're dillydallyin' with your wishes.
Phadrig Oge, he's me lieutenant.
He'll stop at nothin' till he gets me back.
He might even put the come-hither on Katie, so's you'd have to wish her free again.
If he lays a finger on Katie,
I'll kill you dead and murder you entirely.
- Tell your Phadrig Oge that!
- Tell him?
How can I give the order, and me tied up in a sack?
I'll throw you in the river and drown you like a kitten.
Do that, and you'll have a scourge that'll make the potato famine
- look like a Sunday regatta.
- Don't you threaten me.
Your cows will die of the black leg and your sheep of the red water, and in every cradle in town there'll be a changeling!
I'm not afraid of you.
You'd better be.
I'm the one that keeps my kingdom in order, and all the unpleasant spirits of the night will run wild unless you wish your wish and let me go.
To tell you the truth,
I don't know what to wish for.
Then, uh, wish for the gold.
I'll give it to you this time.
Ah, she doesn't want the gold nor the manor house, neither.
- Who doesn't?
- Katie, I'm thinkin' of.
Well, uh, what does she want?
I don't know.
We were happy here, the two of us, but when I catch her dancin' and whirligiggin' with a drunken blatherumskite like Pony Sugrue... well, I don't know her at all.
Ah, she needs to settle her mind on a good steady lad with temperate ways.
That she does.
What if she found such a lad and fell in love with him, and he with her?
Would you wish your wish then?
I would.
Good.
Now, go to bed, have a good sleep.
Leave all to me.
Put your mind at rest.
Michael.
Michael.
What do you want?
I said I'd visit your dreams, and when I make a promise,
I keep it.
Well, I've seen you.
Now go away.
Ah, but I...
- I'd like to talk about Katie.
- How does she concern you?
She's the one that's keepin' me here.
Darby won't wish any more wishes until his girl is pleased.
Well, what can I do about it?
Marry her, and you can all live here as happy as three peas in a pod.
I hardly know the girl.
One look at her and you'll know her.
She's a nice girl and I like her, but...
Good.
Then next Sunday after Mass, take her up to the ruins on the top of Knocknasheega.
'Tis a fine romantic view from there.
Just lookin' down will make any girl so dizzy, she'll fall into your arms.
I don't want her to fall into my arms.
But then, of course,
I can't very well blame you.
Might mean gettin' your head broken.
I know if I was courtin'
Pony Sugrue's girl,
I'd be afraid, too.
Is it puttin' the coward's name on me you are?
Ah, no, no, no.
No, no. Go to sleep now.
Go to sleep.
Good lad.
Go to sleep.
Katie.
Katie.
I say, Katie.
He's a fine strong lad with temperate ways.
Hmm?
Michael is a fine strong lad with temperate ways.
He'd make you a grand husband.
I don't want a husband.
Not yet.
Not yet? Oh, Katie, many a girl has spoke these words and lived to rue them.
You know, when a girl is 20, her boy will marry her up in a minute, but when she's 30, doesn't she have a time trying to make him say the hard word?
- I'll have me courtship first.
- Courtship, is it?
And marriage the bone and sinew of the country?
What would you call a girl who'd keep her lad dangling through pure selfishness or sinful dalliance?
I know what I'd call her.
I'd call her...
I'd...
Katie.
Katie.
(whispers) Yes?
I returned as a matter of courtesy to give you the last word.
Me last word... is no.
That's grand.
That's grand.
Keep on sayin' that.
Keep on sayin' that.
(whispers) Keep on sayin' that.
"The ruins of old Ireland, how wondrously they stand
"by the lakes and rushing rivers on the hilltops of our land."
"Around these walls of battle, the Viking and the Dane, the Norman and the Saxon and the Cavaliers of Spain."
Ah, it makes a man feel like the lord of the castle.
I wonder now, is it the Danes or the Vikings swarming up the valley to storm the fort?
- The Danes.
- We'll both be put to the sword.
But before we are, you would crave the favor of one last kiss.
Mr. MacBride, I thought you could do better than that.
Maybe I could.
(laughing)
(gasps)
You don't care who you walk out with, do you?
Get off this land, or I'll report you to his lordship.
You do that.
(laughs)
Get out of the way.
Look who's talking.
If you lay a finger on him,
I'll never speak to you again!
Katie... when I need your help against the likes of that, I'll ask for it.
Pony Sugrue would have killed you.
- Would you care?
- Not in the slightest.
You have no interest in me at all?
You're certain sure?
Kiss her.
Kiss her.
Go on, kiss her.
Aah!
And him a Dublin man!
Look, look, look.
Will you wish your wish now?
- I will indeed.
- Good.
(bell chiming)
The bell.
Listen to the music of it.
Father Murphy gave it to me.
But the wish, Darby.
Ah, it would charm the fishes from the deep and the little birds down from the trees.
You said you'd wish your wish.
What? On Sunday, with my music floatin' over the countryside and Father Murphy himself pullin' the rope?
Tomorrow is Monday.
Will you wish your wish then?
I will.
Hush now.
Listen to my music.
Whoa, there.
Hello, Joe.
Morning, Mrs. O'Toole.
There's the post.
Did the tea come down from Dublin?
The pails, too.
Where's everybody going?
To the pub.
Darby is making his third wish.
His third wish?
The old fool.
Old fool indeed.
It's makin' too free with them, Darby is.
When you sup with the devil, you need a long spoon.
From America.
Nora Cassidy's son.
- Ah, there'll be money in that.
- The pails, Mrs. O'Toole.
- Right you are, Pony.
- "Michael MacBride, Rathcullen."
That's from the Lord Fitzpatrick.
I'd know his fist anywhere.
Look at the elegant swirls and all.
So that's why his lordship left him behind.
And now 'tis "Michael" this and "Michael" that.
The Dublin jackeen.
"And, Michael, go and open up the manor house
- and get Katie in to help."
- The dirty usurper!
- Poor old Darby.
- Poor Katie.
I wonder, does she know?
Maybe you should drop it by and leave her see it for herself.
Oh.
You think I should, now?
No Christian bein' would do any less.
Then I will so.
Look, Pony, his lordship wrote it to young Michael MacBride, and nary a word to Darby, now I ask you.
Ha! And you said you had an understanding with his lordship about me, and all this time,
MacBride has the job.
He won't keep the job if I have a son who's man enough to run him out of town.
Well, Pony?
What are you doing?
I'm packing, and if you don't know why, you can read the card.
Why didn't you tell me?
Your father made me promise that I wouldn't.
- When are you throwin' us out?
- Oh, now, Katie.
- When?
- Well, today was supposed to have...
- You give short notice.
- I don't want you to leave at all.
Why not?
What does it matter to you if you break an old man's heart?
You're a strong young man.
You can find work anywhere, but, no, you must come here and take me father's place.
No wonder he's chasin' the fairy gold, and him half out of his mind, tryin' to keep some little bit of self-respect in the town.
Here, you can clean the manor house yourself.
It'll be all we can do to move our belongin's out of your house this night.
Now, you listen to me.
I don't want your father's job at all, not unless I can have the both of you along with it.
I want you to stay here and be my wife.
I love you, Katie, and I think that you love me.
I?
Love you?
- Everybody ready?
- Yes, we're all ready, Darby.
Run and get a turf creel, a big one.
- What for?
- For to hold the gold.
- I'll not wish for the gold.
- Why not?
Nine times out of ten, it leads to unhappiness.
Wish for happiness, then.
Human beings need bitter with the sweet.
When I was a young lad, knee high with a sod of turf, me grandfather Podge...
God be good to him...
...he told me there was only one man in the town who was happy altogether... the village idiot.
- (laughter)
- (King Brian) Ha!
Were you addressing me,
Your Majesty?
What's all the speechmaking about?
Are you standin' for Parliament or what?
- Will I get you a drink, sir?
- You could make a wish.
- Get on with it.
- I'll do that.
You know what I'd wish for, Darby?
I'd wish for a grand, big house on top of a hill, as big as the castle at Cong.
- How would you look after it?
- I'd have the servants, too.
You didn't wish for the servants,
You didn't wish for the money to run the house.
There you'd be with a big house in your hands, as big as a church, and you the poorest church mouse in it.
Did you hear that?
Oh, he's got a head on his shoulders like Aristotle.
- Think of the best...
- Father!
Then ask yourself,
"What else might I lose if I had it?"
Father, you've got to come and catch the horse.
Not now, Katie.
His lordship is comin'.
We've got to move today!
Move out of the way, Katie.
I'm makin' me third wish.
Not here, Father!
Wait, Your Highness!
Wait, Your Highness.
Wait!
(mocking) Wait, Your Highness.
Wait!
(man) Catch him, Darby!
Catch the coinin!
(all shouting)
Darby, catch the coinin!
Make him give you the crocks of gold!
The crocks of gold!
- Get out of my way.
- Leave that horse alone.
Do you think I'd stay under your roof another night?
- I'll go to the inn.
- You can go to blazes.
I'm movin' to the McCarthy house.
With night coming down on that mountainside, you could get yourself killed.
Now, give me that halter.
I'll get the horse.
Ah, well, you look grand.
Now, don't move a finger until his lordship comes.
Katie!
Katie!
Katie!
Katie!
Katie!
Katie!
(sniffs)
Is it drunk you are?
- Who did it, lad?
- I don't know, but I can guess.
- Where's Katie?
- She's gone after the horse.
Did you let her go alone in the dark of the night?
She was in a tearin' rage at me, and sure it was your fault for not telling her the truth in the first place.
God forgive me.
She'll be chasin' a puca.
Oh, for goodness sakes.
(female voice wailing)
- The banshee!
- Maybe it's just the wind.
It's the wail of the banshee, the same as I heard the night that Katie's mother was taken.
She'll be destroyed entirely!
(thunder rumbling)
Katie!
Katie!
Katie!
(echo) Katie!
Katie!
(echo) Katie!
Katie!
Katie!
Katie.
Katie!
Katie!
Katie!
The banshee!
(wailing)
Keep away!
Keep away!
Keep away from her!
Keep off!
(wailing loudly)
Keep off, now!
Keep off, now!
Oh, me poor darlin'.
Your daddy didn't mean to do you any harm.
- Speak to me. Speak to me.
- Darby.
What have I done to you?
We'd better get her home.
(banshee wailing)
Brian!
King Brian!
King Brian!
King Brian!
What is it, man?
- Your Highness!
- What is it?
It's the coiste-bodhar, the death coach.
Send it away!
It's comin' for Katie.
Send it away.
But it's not within my powers, man.
Once it sets out, it can never return empty.
Then give me me third wish and let it take me instead.
You don't know what you're askin' for.
You promised!
Don't break your word.
Darby O'Gill, never in me born days...
Give me me third wish.
More's the pity.
Granted.
Darby O'Gill.
Get in.
(King Brian) Darby.
Darby.
I was on me way back home, and I says to meself,
"Brian," says I,
"'tis at his side you should be."
Well, then, the truth of it is,
I'm real glad to see you.
Ah, Darby, me boy,
- we've had great sport together.
- Aye, we did.
You've been a grand adversary.
'Tis sorry I am to see you come to this.
I can endure anything if Katie was all right.
Ah, you needn't fret about Katie.
Her fever broke the minute you set foot in this coach.
I'll be forever grateful to you.
In the years to come, maybe you'd keep an eye on Katie and Michael.
I'll do that.
'Tis a pity you won't be there to see them married.
Ah, it's better for the old to die than the young.
In the end, we all have to go.
That you do.
I wish I could go with you all the way.
I wish you could, too.
(laughing)
And you a knowledgeable man!
Darby, you've wished your fourth wish.
Goodbye, Darby, me friend.
(King Brian laughs)
It's a miracle. She's fine and sonsy, like a baby woken from sleep.
Michael, what a temper I have.
Well...
I like a lively girl.
I suppose I'm the only man alive today
to have rode in the coiste-bodhar and come back to tell it.
Coiste-bodhar.
'Twas his lordship's carriage you saw.
His coachman told me they found you rootin' in the mud of the road, so far gone in grief you were out of your mind entirely.
(laughs)
Pony, I heard you were goin' to live in Cahersiveen.
I am.
Then why don't you be on your way and leave us alone?
Don't worry.
I will.
I've heard enough silly blather about little people to last me a lifetime.
What kind of man are you at all that doesn't believe in the little people?
- Maybe you'd like to find out.
- Indeed I would.
You know, somebody beat me over the head that night, and I thought it was the little people, but when I spoke to King Brian about it, he said that you should take the consequences.
What consequences?
Indeed, that's what I asked his majesty, and you know what he said?
He said, "If I were you,
I'd clout the blackguard in the face."
- Ooh.
- (glass breaks)
Oh!
- (glass breaks)
- Ooh! Oh, gosh.
Ooh!
(whispers) Come on.
(whimpers)
Pony, me darlin'.
Oh, you poor thing.
Hold your whisht.
I'll have no more from you.
- Well, that didn't take long.
- Now I can get back to work.
I even feel like workin' meself.
I do indeed. Aye.
How do you feel about bringin' in the rest of the turf?
Well, lad, you took the words right out of me mouth.
Come around, Cleopatra.
Come on, now.
# Oh, she is my dear my darlin' one
# Her eyes so sparklin' full of fun
# No other, no other can match the likes of her
# Oh, he is my dear my darling one
# His eyes so sparkling full of fun
# No other, no other
# Can match the likes of him
(both) # She is my dear, my darlin' one
# My smilin' and beguilin' one
# I love the ground she walks upon
# My darlin' Irish...

"The Two Turtles"
Here's the greatest toreador in all Spain.
Serve him a bottle of my best wine.
Sit down, please.
Vincente.
- Go and release a bull into the arena.
- Now?
Yes, immediately!
You are crazy, señor.
Don't answer back, do what I ask you.
How?
- Have you prepared tomorrow's bullfight?
- Yes.
So choose the best bull.
What does the card say?
What do you read?
Answer, Mother, I ask you.
What destiny do you predict?
Yes, I suspect, I know it.
Too much obsession with the one who is dead and dishonor in the profession of your son.
You answer now?
It is not necessary to be popular, it's enough to be a man.
The profession of toreador was worthy enough for my father.
But you are not like him.
Enough! Enough comparisons!
I'm not like him, but you can thank God for that!
He was a poor wretch!
Don't talk like that!
You deny your race.
I curse it!
Forgive me, Mother.
I have nothing to forgive you for, Juanito.
Good luck!
Good luck, Matador!
For the lady.
I dedicate the death of this bull to Pandora.
I want to offer a show as great as my love for you and as beautiful as your face.
Knowing your eyes watch me I will fight like no one has before me.
I dance for Pandora!
Dancing for you!
He is alive!
He's here!
But I killed him!
He is alive!
Leave me alone!
THE SEVENTH SEAL
It is the middle of the 14th Century.
Antonius Block and his squire, after long years as crusaders in the holy land... have at last returned to their native Sweden.
A land ravaged by the black plague.
And when the Lamb opened the seventh seal, there was in heaven a silence which lasted about the space of half an hour.
And the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.
- Who are you?
- I am Death.
- Have you come to fetch me?
- I have long walked at your side.
- That I know.
- Are you ready?
My body is, not myself.
- Wait a moment.
- You all say that.
- But I leave no respite.
- You play chess, don't you?
- How do you know?
- From paintings and folk songs.
Yes, I'm actually quite a skilful chess player.
- Not more so than me.
- Why play chess with me?
- That's my affair.
- You are right.
The condition is I live as long as I resist you.
If I conquer you, you free me.
You have black.
It's most appropriate, isn't it?
Squeezed twixt the thighs
On a bed of sighs
That's the only way to be
For a man like me
Our Lord sits up high
He is somewhat shy
But Satan, your crony
Ensures you won't be lonely
They talk of omens and other horrors in Färjestad.
Two horses ate one another last night.
Graves had been opened in the cemetery and remains scattered about.
There were four suns in the heavens yesterday afternoon.
Can you tell me the way to the inn?
- Did he indicate the way?
- Not exactly.
- What did he say?
- Nothing.
- Was he dumb?
- No, one can't say that.
I'd say that he was extremely well-spoken.
Yes, well-spoken. But the speech he made was dour. I have to say.
Good morning.
Have you had any breakfast?
Unfortunately, I can't eat grass.
Can't you teach me?
Things are tight. People aren't interested in art in these parts.
Mia, wake up! I've seen something
I must tell you about.
- Has something happened?
- I've had a vision.
No, not a vision.
It was like it was real.
I see... Have you had another vision?
I saw her, anyway.
- Who? Who did you see?
- The Holy Virgin Mary.
- Really?
- She was so close I could touch her.
She had a crown of gold and a blue dress with flowers, and she was barefoot and had small brown hands.
She held the child and taught him to walk.
Then she saw that I'd seen her and she smiled at me.
I got tears in my eyes and when
I wiped them away, she disappeared.
And it became utterly, utterly quiet everywhere.
In heaven and on earth.
Can you understand that?
- The things you come up with.
- You don't believe me, but it was real.
Not your kind of reality, but another reality.
Like when you said the Devil painted our wagon wheels red using his tail.
Why bring that up?
- Red paint was under your nails.
- Yes, that time it was made up.
I did it so you'd believe in my other visions. The real ones.
Control your visions, or you'll be taken for a fool, which you aren't.
At least not yet, as far as I know.
But one never knows.
I didn't ask for my visions! I can't help the Holy Virgin revealing herself and that angels and devils like to be with me.
Haven't I said it once and for all that I need to sleep in the morning?
I've asked you, begged you, but nothing helps.
That's why I'm now saying... Quiet!
Mikael, Mikael, Mikael...
- He should have a better life than us.
- Mikael will be a great acrobat.
Or maybe a juggler who accomplishes the only impossible trick.
- What trick is that?
- Make one ball remain still in the air.
- It's impossible.
- For us it is. But not for him.
You and your fantasies...
I made up a new song last night.
I lay awake almost all night.
- Do you want to hear my song?
- Sing it. I'm really curious.
There sits a dove on the lily
In the midst of summer
She sings her fair song of Jesus Christ
There is great rejoicing in heaven
- Mia, are you asleep?
- It was a very beautiful song.
- It's not finished yet.
- I'm just going to sleep a little more.
- You can sing the rest later.
- You just sleep and sleep.
Is this disguise worthy of an actor?
I'm only asking.
- If the priests didn't pay, I'd refuse.
- Are you playing Death?
Frighten decent people out of their wits with such nonsense.
- When are we going to do it?
- At the All Saints Festival in Elsinore.
On the actual church steps. Not bad.
Why not something bawdy?
People like it and it's funnier.
Idiot. There's an evil sickness about and priests are preaching grim death and moral bellyaches.
- What roles will we play?
- You're the human soul, you twit.
- Naturally it's a bad role.
- Who decides? Who's the manager?
You fools, keep this law in mind.
Life's thread is of the weakest kind.
Life is short, you will find.
Will women love me in this costume?
I'm only asking.
Jof? Stand perfectly still.
Don't say anything.
- I'm quiet as a mouse.
- I love you.
- What are you painting?
- The dance of Death.
- That's Death?
- Yes, he dances away with them all.
- Why paint such daubings?
- To remind people they will die.
- That won't make them happier.
- Why always make them happy?
- Why not frighten them a bit?
- They'll just close their eyes then.
Believe me, they'll look. A skull is more interesting than a naked wench.
- And if you frighten them?
- They'll think and be more frightened.
- And rush into the priest's embrace.
- Not my business.
- You're just painting Death's dance.
- I'm only showing how it is.
- You'll anger certain people.
- Then I'll paint something cheerful.
One has to make a living.
At least until the plague claims you.
The plague? That's horrifying.
You should see the boil on the neck of the sick.
See how the body contracts, until his limbs become a rope of madness.
- It doesn't look good.
- Yes... It doesn't look good.
He's trying to tear the bubo out of his bed.
He gnaws at his hands, rips out his veins with his nails.
His scream is heard everywhere.
- Are you scared?
- Scared? Me?
You don't know me.
What nonsense is that you've painted?
The strange thing is that people see the plague as a punishment from God.
Supplicants trail through the land and whip themselves into God's favor.
- They beat themselves?
- Yes, it's an awful sight.
You want to run and hide when they come.
Have you got any schnapps?
I've been drinking water all day.
- I'm thirsty as a camel in the desert.
- You did get a little scared, after all.
I want to confess as honestly as I can, but my heart is empty.
And emptiness is a mirror turned to my own face.
I see myself and am seized by disgust and fear.
Through my indifference for people,
I've been placed outside of their society.
Now I live in a ghost world, enclosed in my dreams and imaginings.
- Despite that, you don't want to die.
- Yes, I want to.
- What are you waiting for?
- I want knowledge.
- You want guarantees.
- Call it what you like.
Is it so terribly inconceivable to comprehend God with one's senses?
Why does He hide in a cloud of half-promises and unseen miracles?
How can we believe in the faithful when we lack faith?
What will happen to us who want to believe, but cannot?
What about those who neither want to nor can believe?
Why can't I kill God in me?
Why does He live on in me in an humiliating way despite my wanting to evict Him from my heart?
Why is He, despite all, a mocking reality I can't be rid of?
- Do you hear?
- I hear you.
I want knowledge! Not faith, not assumptions, but knowledge.
I want God to stretch out His hand, uncover His face and speak to me.
- But He remains silent.
- I call out to Him in the darkness.
- But it's as if no one was there.
- Perhaps there isn't anyone.
Then life is a preposterous horror.
No man can live faced with Death, knowing everything's nothingness.
Most people think neither of Death nor nothingness.
But one day you stand at the edge of life and face darkness.
- That day.
- I understand what you mean.
We must make an idol of our fear and that idol we shall call God.
You are worried.
Death came to see me this morning.
We played chess together.
The respite allows me to attend to some business.
What business?
All my life I've been searching, wondering, talking without meaning or context.
It has been nothing. Yes, I say so without bitterness or self-reproach, as I know that almost all of people’s lives are made this way.
But I want to use my respite for one meaningful act.
That's why you are playing chess with Death.
He's a difficult and skilful tactician, but so far I have not surrendered a piece.
How can you outwit Death in your game?
I'm playing a combination of bishop and knight that he hasn't noticed yet.
I'll expose his flank in the next move.
I'll remember that.
You're a traitor. And you cheated me.
But we'll meet again.
And I'll find a way.
We'll meet at the inn.
We'll continue our game then.
This is my hand. I can move it.
My blood gushes in it.
The sun is still high in the sky.
And I... I, Antonius Block, am playing chess with Death.
My master and I have been abroad.
Do you understand, my dear... Pictor?
- The crusades.
- Exactly.
For 10 years, we let snakes bite us, insects sting us, animals maul us, heathens slaughter us, the wine poison us, women infect us, lice eat us, fever rot us.
- Everything in the name of God.
- In the name of God.
Our crusade was so stupid, only an idealist could have invented it.
- All this about the plague is awful.
- It's worse than that.
Oh, yes... It's always your own arse you sit on.
- A great truth.
- Your own arse. Your own arse.
- A profound truth.
- Here is Jöns the squire.
He grins at Death, guffaws at the Lord, laughs at himself, smiles at the girls.
His world is believable to no one but himself.
Ridiculous to everyone, even himself.
Meaningless in heaven and indifferent in hell...
Your stew stinks, what's it for?
She was joined in flesh with the Evil One.
- And now she's in the stocks.
- She will burn in the morning.
- But we must keep the Devil away.
- With that stinking brew?
The best stuff, blood and guts of a big black dog.
The... The Evil One can't bear the smell.
Me neither.
Have you seen the Devil?
- Don't talk to her?
- Is it so dangerous?
I don't know, but she's seen as guilty of the plague that has befallen us.
Oh, fate is a reprobate
You my friend an unfortunate
Now you bound in haste
Now worms lay you to waste
- Must you sing?
- No.
Why do you look so surprised?
I steal from the dead.
It's quite a rewarding domain these days.
You're thinking of telling tales in the village? It won't help.
Each one of us saves his own skin.
It's that simple.
Don't try to scream. No one will hear you, neither God nor man.
It's nothing to be surprised about.
I recognize you, even though it was long ago.
You're Raval from the seminary in Roskilde.
Doctor Mirabilis, Caelestis et Diabilis.
Am I not right?
You convinced my master to go to the
Holy Land on an honorable crusade.
Are you worried?
Butterflies in your belly?
Now I understand the meaning of these 10 years that I thought wasted.
We had it too good, we were too content.
The Lord wanted to punish our self-satisfied pride.
He sent you to spit your heavenly venom and to poison the knight.
- It was in good faith.
- But now you know better, don't you?
Now you're a thief, a more suitable occupation for wretches and villains.
Am I not right?
By all means. I am not bloodthirsty.
Next time I'll mark your face like we do with petty villains of your kind.
I actually came to fill my water bag.
Jöns is the name.
I'm a nice, talkative young man who only thinks good thoughts and commits honorable deeds.
Farewell, my girl.
I could have raped you.
But between us, I'm tired of that kind of love. It's dry in the long run.
When I think of it, I need a housekeeper. Do you cook well?
I'm married, but I have hope my wife will be dead by now.
So I need a housekeeper!
Come now and don't just stand there.
I saved you from death so you owe me!
Bloody hams!
Making a spectacle of themselves.
Stop that, you tin-heads!
I don't start so I'll go behind the drape.
Stop staring, you blockheads!
The horse sits in the tree and crows
The road is wide but the door is low
The Black One dances on the beach
The hen meows in the darkest lake
The day is red but the fish is dead
The Black One squats on the beach
The snake flutters in heaven's heights
The virgin is pale but the pussy shows delight
The Black One runs on the beach
The ram hisses with teeth apart
The gust is harsh and the waves dart
The Black One farts on the beach
The horse sits in the tree and crows
The road is wide but the door is low
The Black One dances on the beach
The hen meows in the darkest lake
The day is red but the fish is dead
The Black One squats on the beach
The snake flutters in heaven's heights
The virgin is pale but the pussy shows delight
The Black One runs on the beach
The sow lays and the cat sows
Night is blighted and darkness glows
The Black One remains, remains
Remains, remains on the beach
God has sent
His punishment over us.
Yes! You will all vanish by the Black Death.
You standing there like open-mouthed cattle.
And you sitting there in bloated self-satisfaction.
Do you know that this could be your final hour?
Death stands behind you.
I can see the crown of his head gleam in the sun.
His scythe flashes when he raises it behind your heads.
Who among you will he strike first?
You there, staring like a goat.
Before evening will your mouth be distorted into a last, unfinished yawn?
And you, woman, blooming with appetite and lust for life.
Will you grow pale and drop before the dawn?
And you there, with your swollen nose and silly grin.
Have you got a year left to pollute the earth with your debris?
Do you know, you confirmed idiots, that you are all going to die?
Today, tomorrow, or the next day.
You are all condemned.
Do you hear what I say? Do you hear the word? Condemned, condemned!
Lord, take pity on us in our degradation.
Don't turn Your face from us in contempt but have mercy on us for the sake of Your Son, Jesus Christ!
This bloody talk of doom. Is that sustenance for a modern man?
Do they really think we'll take them seriously? You laugh at me, Sire.
I've read, heard and experienced most stories we tell one another.
Even the ghost story of God,
Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit,
I've absorbed without much emotion.
- Why are you shouting?
- I'm Plog and you're Jöns.
- That's possible.
- Have you seen my wife?
No, I haven't. But if I had, and she resembled you, I'd be quick to forget.
- So, you haven't seen her?
- Maybe she's run away.
- Do you know anything?
- Quite a lot, but not of your wife.
Go to the tavern and you may find an answer.
It's true, the plague has swamped the west coast. People die like flies.
Business is normally good at this time of year, but my stock's unsold.
They talk of the Last Day. And all the omens certainly are terrible.
A woman gave birth to a calf’s head.
People are crazy. They flee inland and take the plague with them.
If it's as they say, then we'll have to enjoy life as long as we're standing.
Many people have cleaned themselves by fire and died.
But the priest says it is better to die clean than to live for hell.
This is the end, that's what it is. We all know it, but no one dares to say it.
This is the end.
People are crazy with fear.
- And you're scared too?
- Too right I'm scared!
Judgment Day edges toward evening.
The angels descend and the graves open. It will be terrible to see.
- I'll sell you this bracelet cheaply.
- I can't afford it.
- It's genuine silver.
- It's nice, but probably too expensive.
- Have you gentlemen seen my wife?
- Is she lost?
She's run away, they say.
With an actor.
An actor?
If she has such bad taste, let her go.
You are absolutely right.
I was thinking I would kill her.
- I see. Murder is another thing.
- I'm going to kill the actor, too.
- The actor?
- The one she's run off with.
- What for?
- Are you thick?
Oh, the actor! Now I understand.
There are far too many of them.
Even if he's blameless, you should kill him.
- Are you telling tales to him?
- Me? Am I telling tales?
You're also an actor and it's your crony that's snuck off with his wife.
Are you an actor as well?
Me, an actor? Not really.
Then we should kill you. It's logical.
- You're funny.
- You've gone pale.
- Something on your conscience?
- You're funny. Don't you think so?
Maybe we should mark you as one does with petty villains of your kind.
What have you done to my wife?
Do you want to hurt me?
Why?
Have I annoyed anyone or been in the way? I'll leave and never come back.
Stand up so everyone can hear you.
Speak louder.
Stand on your head so we can see whether you're a good actor.
What have you done to my wife?
- Don't whimper. Get up and dance.
- I can't. I won't.
- Imitate a bear.
- I can't imitate a bear.
We'll see if you can anyway.
- Get up. Be a good bear.
- I can't be a bear anymore.
Remember what I'd do to you if we met again?
I'm a man of my word.
- What's his name?
- Mikael.
- How old is he?
- He's just over one year.
- He's big for his age.
- You think so? Yes, he is quite big.
- You were in a performance today.
- Did you think it was bad?
You're more beautiful without make-up.
That dress suits you better.
You think so? Jonas Skat went and left us, so now we're in a real fix.
- Is that your husband?
- Jonas? No.
- The other man is. His name is Jof.
- Oh, him.
Now it's only me and him. We'll have to do tricks again, and that's a bother.
- Do you do tricks as well?
- Oh, yes. And Jof is a good juggler.
- Will Mikael also be an acrobat?
- Jof wants him to be.
- But not you?
- I don't know.
- Maybe he'll be a knight.
- It's not so much fun, I can tell you.
- You don't look happy.
- No.
- Are you tired? Why?
- I have boring company.
- Do you mean your squire?
- No, not him.
- Who do you mean, then?
- Myself.
- Oh, I understand.
- Do you really?
Yes, I understand quite well.
I often wonder why people torment themselves as soon as they can.
- Mia...
- Jof... Jof, what is it?
Jof! Jof, what have you done?
Have you... Come and sit down.
Where have you been?
Let me look at you.
Why did you have to go to the tavern?
You drank, of course.
- I didn't drink a drop.
- You boasted about angels and devils.
- People don't like too many ideas.
- I didn't mention angels.
Then you sang and danced.
You always have to perform.
- People get angry at that, too.
- Look at what...
Look at what I bought for you.
- You couldn’t afford that.
- Well, I did it anyway.
Jof!
- Oh, they gave me such a beating.
- Why didn't you give one back?
I just got scared and angry, but never got that far.
I got angry, believe me.
I roared like a lion.
- Did they get scared?
- No, they just laughed.
Mikael. Mikael.
- Smell how good he smells.
- And he's solid.
You're a solid one, you are.
A real acrobat's body.
This is my husband, Jof.
- Good day.
- Good day.
You have a fine son.
He will bring you joy.
Yes, he is lovely.
Do we have anything to offer, Mia?
- Thanks, I shan't have anything.
- I picked wild strawberries.
- And we actually milked some milk.
- Have milked...
If the knight would join us it would be an honor.
- Sit down and I'll bring the food.
- Please.
- Where are you heading?
- To Elsinore.
- I'd advise against a trip like that.
- Why, if I may ask?
The plague is going down the coast.
People are dying in their ten thousands.
- Trouble always brings his brother.
- Follow me through the woods.
You can stay at my estate or follow the east coast. You'll be safer.
They're wood strawberries.
They grow on the hill.
They're wood strawberries.
They grow on the hill.
I never seen them so big.
Smell how fragrant they are.
- Enjoy the fare.
- I thank you respectfully.
I think your suggestion is good, but I must consider first.
It would be nice to have company through the wood.
It's full of ghosts, devils and thieves.
So I heard.
I said it wasn't bad, but I must consider it.
Since Skat left,
I'm responsible for the troupe.
- I've become the manager, after all.
- "I've become the manager, after all."
- Would you like strawberries?
- That man saved my life.
- Sit down and join us.
- The knight's Jöns conveys his thanks.
- Oh, it's so nice.
- For a short while.
Almost always.
One day is much like the next.
Not so strange.
Summer is better than winter, because you don't freeze.
But spring is the very best.
I wrote a poem about spring.
I'll fetch my lute.
Not now, Jof. Our guests might not be entertained by your verses.
- Please. I write songs myself.
- There you are.
I have one about an unchaste fish you may not have heard.
You won't hear it, either.
Some people don't appreciate my art and I don't wish to torment anyone.
- One worries so much.
- It's better when you are a couple.
- Don't you have anyone?
- Yes.
- What is she doing now?
- I don't know.
You look so solemn.
Was she your sweetheart?
We were newlyweds, played together, laughed quite a lot.
I wrote songs to her eyes, her nose, her exquisite, small ears.
We went on hunts. In the evening we danced. The house was full of life.
Would you like some strawberries?
Faith is a heavy burden, do you know that?
It's like loving someone in the dark who never comes, no matter how you call.
But all of that seems unreal when
I sit here with you and your husband.
It's suddenly insignificant.
Now you don't look so solemn.
I will remember this moment.
The stillness and the dusk.
The bowl of wild strawberries, of milk.
Your faces in the evening light.
Mikael lying asleep,
Jof with his lute.
I will try and remember what we spoke of.
And I will carry this memory between my hands, as carefully as if it were a bowl brimming with freshly milked milk.
And this will be a sign for me, and greatly fulfilling.
I have been waiting.
Excuse me, I was somewhat delayed.
As I've given away my strategy,
I will retreat.
Go ahead. It's your move.
- Why do you look so pleased?
- That's my secret.
Naturally. I will take your knight now.
You were right to.
- Have you tricked me?
- Of course, you fell into the trap.
I put you in check.
- What are you laughing at?
- No matter. Save your king instead.
- You are quite arrogant.
- Our game amuses me.
It's your move.
Be quick, I'm in a hurry.
I know you are busy, but you won't avoid our game. It will take its time.
You're travelling with the jesters through the woods?
The two called Jof and Mia, who have a little son?
Why do you ask?
No reason.
- Have you seen Jöns? We must go.
- I believe he's in the inn.
- Have you seen Jöns? We must go.
- I believe he's in the inn.
Good heavens.
If it isn't Plog the blacksmith.
- Evening.
- Are you sniveling all alone?
Yes, the blacksmith’s sobbing and wailing like a soaked rabbit.
- Still the wife?
- Yes, I haven't found her.
Yes, it's hell with women and hell without them.
Logical to kill them when it's at its best.
- Henpecking and swills.
- Screaming babies and wet nappies.
- Sharp nails and malice.
- The Devil’s aunt as mother-in-law.
- Then when you're going to sleep...
- Another tune.
Tears, complaints and laments by the sackfull.
- "Why don't you kiss me?"
- "Why don't you sing?"
- "Why don't you love me like before?"
- "Why don't you eye my new shift?"
- "You just turn your back and snore."
- Oh, hell...
Oh, hell... She's gone now! Be happy!
I'm going to pinch them in the nose with my pliers.
I'm going to pound them on the chest with the little hammer.
I'm going to crack them lightly on the head with the sledgehammer.
Look, he's blubbering again!
- Maybe I love her.
- Maybe you love her?
Listen, you moron, love is another word for lust, plus lust, plus lust, plus a lot of deception, falsehoods and trickery.
- But it hurts anyway.
- Love is the blackest of all plagues.
If you died from it there'd be some joy.
But it almost always passes.
- No, mine won't pass.
- Oh, yes, yours too!
There are only a few poor dullards now and then who die of love.
If all is imperfect in this imperfect world, then love is most imperfect in its perfect imperfection.
You're lucky to have such a fluid tongue that you believe your own twaddle.
Believe? Who said I did?
But I love giving good advice.
Ask for one and you get two.
So I'm actually a learned chap.
Jöns!
Can I follow you through the woods?
I'm so lonely and don't want to go home as they all laugh at me.
As long as you don't sob all the time or we'll leave you.
Jöns!
- My little brother...
- Watch out, Jöns!
- He just wants to fight.
- He's sobbing now.
I'm really sorry if I harmed you, but I have such a temper.
Take my hand.
- Let me embrace you, little brother.
- A little later, maybe.
We're actually in a hurry. Thanks.
Ah, what do I see? Who is it looms out of the edge of the forest if not My Most Treasured with attached actor!
Watch out!
You must be the dirty blacksmith that humiliated my beloved Kunigunda.
- What did you say her name was?
- Kunigunda. Are you deaf?
Her name's Lisa.
Lisa Daft or Sloven or Tart.
- Drawerless Hussy or Arse Lisa.
- Goodness, he's base!
Just good at sleaze, not unlike yourself, you gilded bawd-pudding.
- Oh, he's base!
- You awful, cropped bastard of seven mangy mongrels, if I were in your infested rags,
I'd be afflicted by such boundless shame that I'd free nature from my embarrassing countenance.
- Watch out, you perfumed...
- "Powder-puff."
...powder-puff, that I don't let off a fart that will assign you to the juggler’s inferno in a flash,
- where you can sit together and...
- "Read soliloquies."
...read soliloquies to one another until dust forms in the Devil’s ears.
Careful I don't poke your belly so your intestines flow out your ears.
Careful I don't smack you so you can't even play for Turks and cannibals.
What are you laughing at?
This is serious.
In southern lands there is a man-like animal called an ape.
- What of it?
- Just that.
- Plog, my only Plog.
- What?
- What?
- Darling Plog, forgive me everything.
- She'll start crying in a minute.
- I have to cry. It's awful.
That man deceived me so badly, you won't believe.
- Kunigunda, if we're going to tell the truth...
- And now for his favorite dishes.
Plog, when we get home
I'll make dumplings for you with mashed turnips and lingonberries, which is your favorite.
- Isn't that so, Plog?
- Yes, but I have to kill him first.
Yes, kill him.
Kill him really properly.
- I don't like him at all anymore.
- God, why did you give us woman?
You know what he is?
Just a false beard, false teeth, false smiles, rehearsed intonation and empty as a jar.
- Go ahead and kill him.
- My dear Plog...
If you thought I'd defend my so-called reality you're mistaken.
- Kill me. I'll thank you. Afterwards.
- What are you saying?
He's created confusion.
Already a half-victory.
- Do something, don't just stand there!
- He has to fight or I can't kill him.
He has to provoke me so I get angry like before.
Dear friend,
I lower this dagger to my breast.
And my reality will quickly transform into a new, solid reality.
The absolute manifestation of the corpse.
Wait... I didn't mean it like that.
I forgive you, Kunigunda. Farewell, my friend, pray for me sometime.
Oh, dear... Oh, dear...
I didn't mean it like that.
I started to really like him.
He's absolutely dead. I've almost never seen such a dead actor.
It's really sad, although he wanted it himself, poor thing.
- And I'm married to her...
- Well, you got your little Lisa back.
- Aren't you happy?
- Jöns, in the strictest confidence...
- Isn't life quite...
- Yes, it is. But don't think about it.
It's mad, that's what it is.
That was a good performance.
I'm nothing if not a good actor.
I'll find a tree and climb it.
So no bears, wolves or ghosts can get hold of me.
I'll find Jof and Mia tomorrow, then we'll go to the All Saints Festival.
I'll sing a song to myself.
I'm a little bird who sings how I want
Craftsmen in the forest. How nice.
By God, it's my tree they're sawing down!
Hey, you dozy cockerel!
What are you doing to my tree?
Can't you answer?
Courtesy is cheap. Who are you?
I'm sawing down your tree as your time is up.
- It's not possible. I don't have time.
- Haven't you got time?
- I've got a performance.
- It's cancelled. Because of a death.
- My contract!
- Annulled.
- My family and my children...
- Shame on you, Skat!
I am ashamed, I'm ashamed...
Aren't there any acquittals?
Any special rules for actors?
No, not in this case.
No loopholes, no exceptions?
The moon just came out from behind the clouds.
Good. We'll see the road better.
- I don't like the moon tonight.
- The trees are so still.
- That's because there isn't any wind.
- He means they are very still.
It's completely quiet.
- If we at least heard a fox.
- Or an owl.
Or a human voice.
Beside one's own.
- Where are you going?
- To the stake.
I see, it's the witch. Why burn her in the middle of the night?
- People lack amusement nowadays.
- Quiet, by all the dev... Saints.
- She has the Devil with her.
- Then you men are eight brave men.
Well, we're paid.
The task was voluntary.
Do you hear me?
- They say you worked with the Devil.
- Why do you ask that?
Not out of curiosity, but for highly personal reasons.
- I also want to meet him.
- Why?
I want to ask him about God.
He must know. He if anyone.
- You can see him when you want.
- How?
But then you must do as I say.
Look into my eyes.
Well? What do you see?
Do you see him?
I see a rigid fear in your eyes.
Nothing else.
No one, nothing... No one...
No.
Isn't he standing behind your back either?
No. There's nothing here.
But he's with me everywhere. I only need to put out my hand and I feel his.
He is with me now as well.
The fire won't hurt me.
- Has he said so?
- I know.
I know, I know. You must see him somewhere, you must!
The priest had no trouble seeing him, nor the troops.
They're so scared of him they don't even dare to touch me.
- Why have you crushed her hands?
- It's not us.
- Who?
- Ask the monk over there.
What have you done to the girl?
Do you never cease asking?
No. I never cease.
But you don't get any answer.
I thought about killing the guard, but it doesn't help. She's almost dead.
I told you to watch out!
Don't go near to her.
Eat this and the pain will go.
- What's she see? Can you answer?
- She's not in pain anymore.
You're not answering my question.
Who will take care of that child?
Is it the angels or God or Satan or just emptiness?
- Emptiness, Sire.
- It can't be so!
Look at her eyes. Her poor consciousness is perceiving something.
- Emptiness under the moon.
- No.
We stand powerless with hanging arms, as we see what she sees.
Our fear and hers are the same.
That little child... I can't be bothered, I can't be bothered...
He sings so beautifully of Jesus Christ
There is great joy in heaven
The dawn will break soon.
Yet the heat hangs like a damp blanket.
I'm so scared.
We feel something is going to happen to us, but we don't know what it is.
- Maybe the final day.
- The final day.
Haven't you got any water?
Can you give me some water?
- I've got the plague.
- Keep to the other side of the stump!
I'm scared of dying.
I don't want to die, I don't want to!
Can't you take pity on me? Help me...
At least talk to me!
It doesn't help. It doesn't help.
I know it doesn't help at all.
I'm going to die. I... I...
What's going to happen to me?
Can't you even comfort me?
Haven't you got any mercy?
Can't you see that I...
Is there no help?
Can't I have any water?
It's meaningless.
It's completely meaningless.
I said, it's meaningless.
- Help me!
- Can't you hear I'm comforting you?
- Shall we conclude our game?
- It's your move.
- I took your queen.
- I didn't see that.
Mia... I see something terrible, something almost unspeakable.
- What do you see?
- The knight is playing chess.
- I see that too. It's not so terrible.
- You see who he's playing with?
- He's alone. Don't scare me like that.
- No, no. He's not alone.
- Who is it?
- Death. He's playing Death himself.
- Don't say that.
- We must try and get away.
- We can't.
- We must try.
They're so engrossed in their game, if we leave quietly they won't notice.
It's your move, Antonius Block.
- Have you lost interest in our game?
- Lost interest? On the contrary.
You look anxious.
Are you concealing something?
- Nothing escapes you. Isn't that so?
- Nothing escapes me.
- No one escapes me.
- It is true I'm anxious.
You are scared.
I forget where the pieces were.
But I haven't forgotten.
You won't get away that easily.
- I see something interesting now.
- What do you see?
You will be checkmate in the next move.
That's true.
- Did you profit from your respite?
- Yes, I did.
That pleases me. I will leave you now.
When we meet again you and your entourage's time will be over.
- And you'll reveal your secrets?
- I carry no secrets.
So you know nothing?
I am unknowing.
- Do you see that strange light?
- It's the storm coming with the dawn.
It's something else, something terrible. You hear the rumbling?
- It's probably the rain.
- No, it's not the rain.
He's seen us, followed us, he's caught up to us, he's coming at us!
Get in the wagon, Mia.
Let's get in, quickly!
It's the angel of death passing by,
Mia. The angel of death.
- And he's very big...
- Do you feel how cold it is?
I heard from returning crusaders that you were on your way home.
I've waited for you.
All the others have fled the plague.
Don't you recognize me anymore?
You've also changed.
Now I can see it's you.
Somewhere in your eyes...
Somewhere in your face, but hidden and frightened, is that boy that set off all those years ago.
It's over now and I'm a little tired.
- Do you regret your journey?
- No.
I don't regret anything.
But I'm a little tired.
I can see...
My friends are there.
Ask them to come in.
I'll set the table for breakfast.
"And when the Lamb opened the seventh seal,
"there was in heaven a silence
"which lasted about the space of half an hour.
"And the seven angels who had the seven trumpets
"prepared themselves to sound.
"The first angel sounded
"and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood,
"and they were cast upon the earth.
"And the third part of the earth was burnt up,
"and the third part of trees was burnt up,
"and all green grass was burnt up.
"And the second angel sounded,
"and as it were a great mountain burning with fire
"was cast into the sea.
"And the third part of the sea became blood."
Was there anyone there?
No, Sire. I saw no one.
"And the third angel sounded,
"and there fell a great star from heaven
"burning as it were a lamp.
"And the name of the star is called Wormwood."
Good day, noble Sire.
I am Karin, wife of the knight. I bid you a courteous welcome to my home.
I am a blacksmith by trade and quite good if I say so myself.
My wife, Lisa.
Curtsey for the honorable Sire, Lisa.
She's a little difficult at times and we've had a little affray but no worse than most people.
In our darkness we call out to you, Lord.
Oh, God, have mercy on us.
For we are small, afraid and without knowledge.
In that darkness where you claim to reside, where we probably all reside, you'll find no one that listens to your complaint or is moved by your suffering.
- Dry your tears, mirror your apathy.
- God, you that exist somewhere, that must exist somewhere, have mercy on us.
I had an herb to purge your anxiety over the eternal. Now it's too late.
Feel in this final minute the triumph of rolling your eyes and moving your toes.
- Quiet... Quiet.
- I'll be quiet, but under protest!
It is finished.
Mia! I can see them, Mia.
I can see them.
Over there under the storm-laden skies.
They're all there.
The blacksmith and Lisa, the knight and Raval, Jöns and Skat...
And the grim master, Death, invites them to dance.
He wants them to hold hands and dance in a long line.
And the grim master leads with scythe and hourglass.
Skat brings up the rear with his lyre.
They move away, away from the dawn, in a solemn dance, away to the dark country.
Whilst the rain washes over their faces, cleans their cheeks of tears of salt.
You and your dreams and visions...
I know you
I waked with you
once upon a dream
I know you
The gleam in your eyes
is so familiar a gleam
Yet I know it's true
That visions
are seldom all they seem
But if I know you
I know what you'll do
You'll Love me at once
The way you did
once upon a dream
"In a far away land
long ago lived a King...
"and his fair Queen.
"Many years had they longed
for a child...
"and finally
their wish was granted.
"A daughter was born,
and they called her Aurora."
Sweet Aurora
"Yes, they named her
after the dawn...
"for she filled their lives
with sunshine.
"Then a great holiday
was proclaimed...
"throughout the kingdom...
"so that all of high
or low estate...
"might pay homage
to the infant Princess.
"And our story begins
on that most joyful day."
On that joyful day
On that joyful day
Joyfully now
to our Princess we come
Bringing gifts
and all good wishes
To replete
our loyalty anew
Hail to the Princess Aurora
All of her subjects
adore her
Hail to the King
Hail to the Queen
Hail to the Princess Aurora
Health to the Princess,
wealth to the Princess
Long live
the Princess Aurora
Hail Aurora
Hail Aurora
Health to the Princess,
wealth to the Princess
Long Live
the Princess Aurora
Hail to the King
Hail to the Queen
Hail to the Princess Aurora
"Thus,
on this great and joyous day...
"did all the kingdom celebrate
the Awaited-awaited royal birth...
"and good King Stefan
and his Queen made welcome...
"their Lifelong friend."
Their Royal Highnesses...
King Hubert
and Prince Philip!
"Fondly had these
monarchs dreamed one day...
"their kingdoms to unite...
"thus, today would they
announce...
"that Philip,
Hubert's son and heir...
"to Stefan's child
would be betrothed."
"And so, to her
his gift he brought...
"and Looked, unknowing,
on his future bride."
Their most honored
and exalted Excellencies...
the three good fairies...
Mistress Flora...
Mistress Fauna...
and Mistress Merryweather!
- Ahh.
- Oh.
The little darling.
Your Majesties.
Each of us the child may bless... with a single gift... no more, no less.
Little Princess, my gift shall be... the gift of beauty.
One gift
Beauty rare
Gold of sunshine
in her hair
Lips that shame
the red, red rose
She'll walk with springtime
wherever she goes
Tiny Princess... my gift shall be the gift of song.
One gift
The gift of song
Melody her whole life Long
The nightingales
her tune adore
Bringing his sweet
serenade to her door
Sweet Princess, my gift shall be the...
Wind howls]
Why, it's Maleficent.
What does she want here?
Shhh.
Well...
Quite a glittering assemblage, King Stefan.
Royalty, nobility, the gentry, and... ah ha ha ha ha... how quaint.
Even the rabble.
Ooooh.
I really felt quite distressed... at not receiving an invitation.
You weren't wanted.
Not wa... ah ha.
Oh, dear, what an awkward situation.
I had hoped
it was merely due...
to some oversight.
Well, in that event,
I'd best be on my way.
And... you're not offended,
Your Excellency?
Why, no, Your Majesty... and to show I bear no ill will...
I, too, shall bestow a gift on the child.
Listen well, all of you.
The Princess shall indeed grow in grace and beauty... beloved by all who know her.
But... before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday... she shall prick her finger...
on the spindle
of a spinning wheel...
and die!
Oh, no!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
Seize that creature!
Stand back, you fools!
Don't despair,
Your Majesties.
Merryweather still has her gift to give.
Then she can undo this fearful curse?
Oh, no, sire.
Maleficent's powers are far too great.
But she can help.
But...
Just do
your best, dear.
Yes, go on.
Sweet Princess...
If through this
wicked witch's trick...
a spindle should
your finger prick...
a ray of hope
there still may be in this...
the gift I give to thee.
Not in death,
but just in sleep...
this fateful prophecy
you'll keep...
and from this slumber
you shall wake...
when true love's kiss
the spell shall break.
For true Love
conquers all
"But King Stefan...
"still fearful
of his daughter's Life...
"did then and there decree...
"that every spinning wheel
in the kingdom...
"should on that very day
be burned.
"So 'rwas done."
Oh, silly...
Now, come have a nice cup of tea, dear.
I'm sure it will work out somehow.
Well, a bonfire won't stop Maleficent.
Of course not, but what will?
Perhaps if we
reason with her...
Reason?
With Maleficent?
Well, she can't be all bad.
Oh, yes, she can.
Oooh. I'd like to turn her into a fat, old hop toad.
Now, dear, that isn't a very nice thing to say.
Besides, we can't.
You know our magic doesn't work that way. it can only do good, dear... to bring joy and happiness.
Well, that would make me happy.
But there must be some way.
But there must be some way.
There is!
There is?
What is it, Flora?
I'm going to...
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
[QUIETLY
Even walls have ears.
Follow me.
I'll turn her into a flower.
Maleficent?
No, no, dear, the Princess.
Oh, she'd make a lovely flower.
Don't you see?
A flower can't prick its finger. it hasn't any.
That's right.
She'll be perfectly safe.
Until Maleficent sends a frost.
Yes. Er...
Oh, dear.
She always ruins your nicest flowers.
You're right... and she'll be expecting us to do something like that.
Oooh.
Well, what won't she expect?
She knows everything.
Oh, but she doesn't, dear.
Maleficent doesn't know anything about love... or kindness or the joy of helping others.
You know, sometimes
I don't think...
she's really very happy.
That's it.
Of course.
It's the only thing she can't understand... and won't expect.
Oh!
Now, now, now... we have to plan it carefully.
Let's see,
the woodcutter's cottage.
Yes, yes, yes,
the abandoned one.
Of course, the King and Queen will object...
but when we explain
it's the only way...
Explain what?
About the three peasant women raising a foundling child... deep in the forest.
Oh?
Well, that's very nice of them.
Who are they?
Turn around.
- Why, it's us!
- Uh-huh.
You mean we us?
Uh-huh.
Take care of the baby?
Why not?
Oh, I'd like that!
Well, y-yes, but we'd have to feed it...
And wash it and dress it and rock it to sleep.
Oh, I'd love it.
You really think we can?
If humans can do it, so can we.
And we'd have our magic to help us.
That's right.
No, no, no, no, no, no!
No magic.
I'll take those wands right now.
Oh, better get rid of those wings, too.
You mean live like mortals?
For sixteen years?
Uh-huh.
But now... now we don't know how.
We've never done anything without magic.
And that's why Maleficent will never suspect.
But who'll wash and cook?
Oh, we'll all pitch in.
I'll take care of the baby.
Let me have it, dear.
Come along, now.
We must tell
Their Majesties at once.
Flora.
Flora.
 "So the King
and his Queen watched...
"with heavy hearts...
"as their most precious
possession, their only child...
"disappeared into the night."
"Many sad and lonely years
passed by...
"for King Stefan
and his people.
"But as the time
for the Princess's...
"sixteenth birthday
drew near...
"the entire kingdom
began to rejoice...
"for everyone knew...
"that as Long
as Maleficent's domain...
"the forbidden mountains...
"thundered with her wrath
and frustration...
"her evil prophecy
had not yet been fulfilled."
It's incredible!
Sixteen years, and not a trace of her!
She couldn't have vanished
into thin air!
Are you sure you searched everywhere?
Yeah, yeah, uh...
Everywhere... we all did.
Yeah! Yeah!
And what about the town?
The forest? The mountains?
Uh, we check mountains... uh... uh, forest...
Uh, houses and, uh, let me see, uh... and all the cradles.
Cradles?
Uh, yep, yep.
Ha ha ha ha.
Every cradle.
Cradle?!
Did you hear that, my pet?
All these years...
they've been looking
for a baby.
Oh, ha ha ha!
Fools!
Idiots!
Imbeciles!
- Aaah!
- Aaah!
Ooh! Ooh!
Ouch! Ouch!
Ahhh.
Oh, they're hopeless... a disgrace to the forces of evil.
Oh, my pet.
You are my last hope.
Circle far and wide.
Search for a maid of sixteen, with hair of sunshine gold... and lips red as the rose.
Go, and do not fail me.
"And so,
for sixteen Long years...
"the whereabouts
of the Princess...
"remained a mystery...
"while deep in the forest
in a woodcutter's cottage...
"the good fairies carried out
their well-laid plan.
"Living like mortals...
"they had reared the child
as their own...
"and called her Briar Rose."
"On this,
her sixteenth birthday...
"the good fairies
had planned a party...
"and something extra special
for a surprise."
Well, now, how about this one?
This is the one I picked.
Ooh, she'll look beautiful in that.
Now, I thought a few changes here.
Uh-huh.
Don't forget a pretty bow.
Yes, and raise the shoulder line.
We'll make it blue.
Oh, no, dear, pink.
Of course, we'll need a few pleats.
Yes, but how are
we going to get her...
out of the house?
I'll think
of something.
Well.
And what are you
three dears up to?
- Up to?
- Up to?
Up to? Er, er...
We... we want you to pick some berries.
That's it... berries.
- Berries?
- Lots of berries.
But I picked berries yesterday.
Oh, we need more, dear.
Lots, lots more.
Yes.
Now, don't hurry back, dear.
But don't go too far.
And don't speak to strangers.
Good-bye, dear.
Good-bye!
Good-bye!
I wonder if she suspected.
Of course not.
Come on.
Oh, will she be surprised.
A real birthday party... with a real birthday cake.
Yes, and a dress a Princess can be proud of.
I'll get the wands.
Yes, you g... the wands?
Oh, no!
No magic.
But the sixteen years are almost over.
We're taking no chances.
But I've never baked a fancy cake.
Oh, you won't have to, dear.
I'm going to bake the cake.
You?
Oh, she's always wanted to, dear... and this is her last chance.
Well...
I'm going to make it fifteen layers... with pink and blue forget-me-nots.
And I'm making the dress.
But you can't sew, and she's never cooked.
Oh, ho, ho, it's simple.
All you do is follow the book.
Up here, dear.
You can be the dummy.
Well, I still say we ought to use magic.
 La la
la da da da da
Dee dee dee deedle um
La da da
"Flour, 3 cups."
Cups, cups, cups, cups, cups, cups, cups.
Oh.
Dee da dee da da dum
What's that for?
Well, it's got to have a hole in the bottom.
That's for the feet
to go through.
It's pink.
Oh, lovely shade, isn't it?
But I wanted it blue.
Now, dear... we decided pink was her color.
You decided.
"Two eggs, fold in gently."
Fold?
Oh, well.
I can't breathe!
Get me out of here! it looks awful.
That's because it's on you, dear.
"Now yeast, 1 tsp."
Tsp?
One teaspoon.
One teaspoon! Of course!
Hmm.
Oh, gracious!
How that child has grown!
Oh, it seems only yesterday we brought her here.
Just a tiny baby.
Why, Merryweather!
Whatever is the matter, dear?
After today, she'll be a Princess... and we won't have any Briar Rose.
Oh, Flora!
Now, now, now, now.
W-we... we all knew this day had to come.
But why did it have to come so soon?
After all... we've had her for sixteen years.
Sixteen wonderful years.
Good gracious!
We're acting like a lot of ninnies!
Come on! She'll be back before we get started.
Do you hear that, Samson?
Beautiful!
What is it?
Come on. Let's find out.
Aw, come on.
For an extra bucket of oats?
And a few... carrots?
Hup, boy!
Whoa!
No carrots.
I wonder
I wonder
I wonder why
each little bird
Has a someone
To sing to
Sweet things to
A gay, little lark melody
I wonder
I wonder
If my heart
keeps singing
Will my song
go winging
To someone
Who'll find me
And bring back
a Love song to me
Oh, dear.
Why do they still treat me like a child?
Whoo!
Aunt Flora, Aunt Fauna...
Aunt Merryweather.
They never want me to meet anyone.
But you know something?
Whispering]
I fooled them.
I have met someone.
Whoo!
Whoo! Whoo!
Oh... a Prince.
Well, he's tall and handsome and... and so romantic!
Oh, we walk together and talk together... and just before we say good-bye... he takes me in his arms...
And then...
I wake up.
Yes,
it's only in my dreams.
But they say if you dream
a thing more than once... it's sure to come true.
And I've seen him so many times.
You know, Samson... there's something strange about that voice.
Too beautiful to be real.
Maybe it was
some mysterious being... a... a wood sprite or a...
Here! Stop!
Why,
it's my dream Prince!
Your Highness.
You know, I'm really not supposed... to speak to strangers... but we've met before.
I know you
I waked with you
once upon a dream
I know you
The gleam in your eyes
is so familiar a gleam
And I know it's true
That visions are seldom
all they seem
But if I know you
I know what you'll do
You'll Love me at once
The way you did once
upon a dream
But if I know you
I know what you'll do
You'll Love me at once
The way you did
once upon a dream
Oh!
Oh!
I'm awfully sorry.
I didn't mean to frighten you.
Oh, it... wasn't that.
It's just that you're a... a...
A stranger?
Mm-hmm.
But don't you remember?
We've met before.
We... we have?
Well, of course.
You said so yourself.
"Once upon a dream."
I know you
I walked with you
once upon a dream
I know you
The gleam in your eyes
Is so familiar a gleam
And I know it's true
That visions are
seldom all they seem
But if I know you
I know what you'll do
You'll Love me at once
The way you did once
Upon a dream
Who are you?
What's your name?
Hmm?
Oh. My name.
Why, it's... it's...
Oh, no, no! I can't! I...
Good-bye!
But when will I see you again?
Oh, never! Never!
Never!
Well... maybe someday.
When? Tomorrow?
Oh, no. This evening.
Where?
At the cottage, in the glen.
There.
Whoop!
Well, what do you think of it?
Why, it... it's a very unusual cake, isn't it?
Yes.
Of course, it will be much stiffer after it's baked.
Of course, dear.
Um... what do you think of the dress?
Well, it... it's...
It-it's not exactly...
the way it is in
the book, is it?
Oh, I improved it.
But perhaps if I added a few more ruffles... uh, what do you think?
Um... I think so.
What do you think,
Merryweather?
I think we've had enough of this nonsense!
I think we ought to think of Rose and what she'll think of this mess!
I still think what
I thunk before.
I'm going to get those wands!
You know... I think she's right.
Here they are!
Good as new!
Uh, uh, tut,
tut, tut, tut...
C-c-careful, Merryweather.
Quick!
Lock the doors.
Fauna,
you close the windows.
Oh, plug up every cranny.
We can't take any chances.
Now, you take care of the cake.
While I...
Clean the room, dear.
And I'll make the dress.
Now, hurry!
Ooh!
Come on, bucket, mop, broom.
Flora says,
"Clean up the room."
And now, to make a lovely dress fit to grace a fair Princess.
Eggs, flour, lemon
Just do it like it says here in the book.
I'll put on the candles.
Oh, no! Not pink!
Oh, no! Not pink!
Make it blue!
Merryweather!
Make it pink.
Whispering]
Make it blue.
Oh! Pink!
Blue!
Oh, now look
what you've done!
Shh! Shh! Listen!
It's Rose!
She's back!
Enough of this foolishness!
Make it pink.
Now hide! Quick!
Whispering]
Blue!
Aunt Flora!
Good gracious!
Who left the mop running?
Stop, mop!
Aunt Flora!
Fauna! Merryweather!
Where is everybody?
Oh!
Surprise! Surprise!
Happy Birthday!
Oh, you darlings!
This is the happiest day of my life!
Everything's so wonderful!
Just wait till you meet him!
Him?
Rose!
You've met some stranger?
Oh, he's not a stranger.
We've met before.
You have?
Where?
Once upon a dream.
I know you
I walked with you
once upon a dream
She's in love!
- Oh, no!
- This is terrible!
Why?
After all, I am sixteen. it isn't that, dear.
You're already betrothed.
Betrothed?
Since the day you were born.
To Prince Phillip, dear.
But that's impossible.
How could I marry a Prince?
I'd have to be...
A Princess.
And you are, dear.
Princess Aurora.
Tonight, we're taking you back
to your father, King Stefan.
But... but I can't!
He's coming here tonight.
I promised to meet him.
I'm sorry, child.
But you must never see that young man again.
Oh, no! No!
I can't believe it!
No! No!
And we thought she'd be so happy.
No sign of her yet, Hubert.
Of course not.
It's a good half-hour till sunset.
Ah, excellent bird.
Mmm!
Aw, now, come, man!
Buck up!
Battle's over.
Girl is
as good as here.
I'm sorry, Hubert... but after sixteen years of worrying... never knowing...
The past! All in the past!
Tonight,
we toast the future... with something I've been saving for sixteen years.
Here!
To the future!
Right, Hubert.
To the future!
Skumps! Skumps!
Skumps!
A toast to this night
The outlook is rosy
The future is bright
Our children
will marry
Our kingdoms unite
Skumps, skumps,
skumps
Ah!
Excellent vintage!
And now, to the new home, eh?
New home?
Children need a nest of their own, what?
A place to raise their
little brood, eh?
Well,
I suppose, in time.
Of course! To the home!
- Skumps!
- Skumps!
A toast to the home
One grander, by far
Than a palace in Rome
Uh, let me fill up your glass.
Ha! Ha! That last was all foam.
Skumps, skumps, skumps
The plans!
Weir,
what do you think?
Nothing elaborate, of course.
Forty bedrooms, dining hall.
Honeymoon cottage, really.
You... you mean... you're building it already?
Built, man! Finished!
Lovebirds can move in tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
But, Hubert, they're not even married yet!
I'll take care of that tonight.
To the wedding!
Now, hold on, Hubert.
I haven't even seen
my daughter yet...
and you're taking her
away from me.
Getting
my Philip, aren't you?
Yes, but...
Want to see our
grandchildren, don't we?
Of course, but...
Well, there's no time to lose.
Getting on in years.
Ha! Ha! Ha!
To the wedding!
Now,
be reasonable, Hubert.
After all, Aurora knows
nothing about all this.
- Well?
- Well, it... it... may come as quite a shock.
Shock?!
My Phillip a shock?!
What's wrong with my Phillip?
Nothing, Hubert.
I only meant...
Why doesn't your daughter like my son?
Now, now...
I'm not so sure my son likes your daughter!
Now, see here...
I'm not so sure my grandchildren... want you for a grandfather!
Why, you... you unreasonable... pompous, blustering, old windbag!
Unreasonable? Pompous?
En garde, sir!
I warn you, Hubert!
This means war!
Forward!
For honor! For country! For...
What's this all about, anyway?
Nothing, Hubert.
Absolutely nothing.
The children are bound to fall in love with each other.
Precisely.
And as for grandchildren...
I'll have the royal woodcarvers... start work on the cradle tomorrow!
Splendid!
King size, of course?
Certainly.
To the Woodcarver's Guild!
His Royal Highness...
Prince Philip!
Phillip!
Oh, Phillip!
Phillip!
Phillip! Hold, Phillip!
H-hurry, boy!
Hurry! Change into something suitable!
Can't meet your future bride looking like that.
But I have met her, Father.
You have? Where?
Once upon a dream.
Phillip!
Stop! Stop that!
Phillip! P-put me down!
Now... what's all this dream nonsense? it wasn't a dream, Father.
I really did meet her.
The Princess Aurora?
Good heavens!
We must tell Stefan!
Why, this is the most...
I didn't say it was Aurora.
You most certainly did!
You... you said that...
I said I met the girl
I was going to marry.
I don't know who she was.
A peasant girl,
I suppose...
A peasant g-girl?
You're... you're going to marry a...
Why, Phillip!
You're joking!
Uh... isn't he?
No! Y-you can't do this to me!
Give up the throne?
The kingdom?
For some... some nobody?
By Harry, I won't have it!
You're a Prince!
And you're going to marry a Princess!
Now, Father, you're living in the past.
This is the 14th century.
Nowadays...
Nowadays,
I'm still the King!
And I command you to come to your senses!
And marry the girl I love.
- Exactly!
- Good-bye, Father.
"Good-bye, Father.
Marry the girl you..."
No, no!
No, no, Phillip, stop!
Come back!
Oh, Philip!
Phillip!
Oh!
Oh, how... how will
I ever tell Stefan?
Whispering]
Come along, now.
All right, in here, dear.
Bolt the door,
Merryweather!
Fauna, pull the drapes!
And now, dear, if you'll just sit here.
This one last gift... dear child for thee... the symbol of thy royalty.
A crown to wear in grace and beauty, as is thy right and royal duty.
Now, dear.
Whispering]
Come.
Let her have a few moments alone.
It's that boy she met.
Whatever are we going to do?
Oh, I don't see why she has to marry any old Prince.
Now, that's not for us to decide, dear.
Maybe we should tell King Stefan about the boy.
Well, why don't we?
Listen!
Maleficent! Rose!
Rose! Rose! Aah!
Oh, why did
we leave her alone?
Rose! Rose!
Here.
Rose! Rose!
Rose, where are you?
Where are you?
Rose!
Rose!
Rose!
Rose!
Rose, don't touch anything!
Touch the spindle.
Touch it, I say!
You poor, simple fools.
Thinking you could defeat me.
Me, the mistress
of all evil!
Well, here's your precious Princess.
Rose!
Oh, Rose!
Oh, I'll never forgive myself.
We're all to blame!
Stefan, there's... there's something important
I have to tell you.
Not now, Hubert.
But it's about Phillip.
Phillip?
Oh, yes, of course, Phillip.
Why, where is the boy?
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
Well, send for him immediately!
- But...
- Shh!
The sun has set!
Make ready to welcome
your Princess!
Poor King Stefan and the Queen.
They'll be heartbroken when they find out.
They're not going to.
They aren't?
We'll put them all to sleep... until Rose awakens.
Come!
Sleeping beauty fair
Gold of sunshine
In your hair
Lips that shame
The red, red rose
Dreaming of true Love
In slumber repose
One day he will come
Riding out of the dawn
And you'll awaken
To Love's first kiss
Till then,
Sleeping Beauty
Sleep on
One day you'll awaken
To Love's first kiss
Till then,
Sleeping Beauty
Sleep on
Well, just been talking to Phillip.
Seems he's fallen in love with some...
Peasant girl.
Peasant girl?
Yes? Yes?
The peasant girl... who is she?
Where did he meet her?
Just some peasant girl he met.
Where?! Where?!
Once upon a dream.
Once upon a dr...
Rose! Prince Phillip!
Oh! Oh!
Come on.
We've got to get back to the cottage.
Whistling
Once Upon a Dream]
Come in!
Well... this is a pleasant surprise.
I set my trap for a peasant, and lo,
I catch a Prince!
Away with him.
But gently, my pets... gently.
I have plans for our royal guest.
Maleficent!
She's got Prince Phillip!
At the forbidden mountain.
But we can't!
We can't go there!
We can, and we must!
What a pity Prince Phillip... can't be here to enjoy the celebration.
Come.
We must go to the dungeon and cheer him up.
Oh, come now, Prince Phillip.
Why so melancholy?
A wondrous future lies before you.
You, the destined hero... of a charming fairy tale come true.
Behold...
King Stefan's castle...
And in yonder
topmost tower...
Dreaming of her true Love...
the Princess Aurora.
But see the gracious
whim of fate.
Why, 'tis the selfsame
peasant maid...
who won the heart
of our noble Prince...
but yesterday.
She is indeed
most wondrous fair.
Gold of sunshine
in her hair.
Lips that shame
the red, red rose.
In ageless sleep...
she finds repose.
The years roll by... but a hundred years to a steadfast heart... are but a day.
And now the gates
of a dungeon part...
and our Prince
is free to go his way.
Off he rides
on his noble steed...
a valiant figure...
straight and tall... to wake his love... with love's first kiss...
and prove that true Love
conquers all.
Why, you... you...
Come, my pet.
Let us leave our noble Prince... with these happy thoughts.
A most gratifying day.
For the first time in sixteen years...
I shall sleep well.
Shh! No time to explain.
Wait, Prince Phillip.
The road to true love may be barred... by still many more dangers...
which you alone
will have to face.
So arm thyself... with this enchanted shield of virtue...
and this mighty sword
of truth.
For these weapons
of righteousness...
will triumph over evil.
Now, come. We must hurry.
Whinnies]
Phillip, watch out!
Silence!
You, tell those fools to...
No! No!
Watch out, Phillip!
Hurry! Hurry, Phillip!
A forest of thorns shall be his tomb.
A forest of thorns shall be his tomb.
Born through the skies on a fog of doom.
Now go with the curse
and serve me well...
Round Stefan's castle...
Cast my spell!
Whinnies]
Whinnies]
No, it cannot be!
Now shall you deal with me, o Prince... and all the powers of hell!
Whinnies]
Up! Up this way!
Now, Sword of Truth, fly swift and sure... that evil die and good endure!
Oh, oh, uh, forgive me, Hubert.
The wine.
Now, uh, you were saying?
Huh? I was?
Oh, oh, yes.
Well, after all, Stefan... this is the 14th century.
Yes. You, uh... you said that a moment ago.
Well, to come right to the point... my son Phillip says he's going to marry...
It's Aurora. She's here!
And... and... and Phillip!
What does this mean, boy?
I... I don't...
But, but, but...
I don't understand.
Why, Fauna, what's the matter, dear?
Oh, I just love happy endings.
Yes. I do, too.
Blue?!
Pink!
I know you,
I walked with you once...
Blue!
... upon a dream
I know you
The gleam in your eyes
Is so familiar a gleam
And I know it's true
That visions
are seldom all they seem
But if I know you
I know what you'll do
You'll Love me at once
The way you did once
Upon
A
Dream

A chair, a glass of wine
and a pipe
Excuse me, Master
if you don't mind
l'll sit and drink and smoke
same as you
Fair's fair
- How true
Make a place for two
Come on, make a place for two
Nott' e giorno mal dormire
The devil take you and Mozart
At once, sir
What makes you so put out
lndeed we never would have known you
Now what on earth
brought that about
Frozen earth all dead or dying
There in the snow buried deep
And outside where he was lying
The sight of a drunkard asleep
That's true
Seeing him there
a craving seized my brain
For drinking
Yes, drinking
Then do the same
Lie down there in the ditch
- And for a pillow
- The pavement
- And for a roof
- The sky
- What about sheets
- The rain
Are you having nightmares, Hoffmann
The first song is yours then
Don't make us ask again
The chorus leave to us
Yes, leave that to us
Right
Choose something that's gay
Sing the song of the rat
No, we're all sick of that
l know
We'll have to have
the one about Kleinzach
Oh, yes, come on
We'll have the song about Kleinzach
Right
Here's Kleinzach
Now long ago
the duke of renowned Eisenach
The duke of Eisenach
Employed a tiny clown
with the name of Kleinzach
He had the name Kleinzach
He wore a busby big and black
And his noddle
his noddle did go crick-crack
Crick-crack
Crick-crack
So that's
So that's Kleinzach
- Crick-crack
- Crick-crack
- Crick-crack
- Crick-crack
So that's
So that's
Kleinzach
He also had a paunch
quite as stout as a stack
As stout as any stack
His feet looked just like twigs
sticking out of a sack
Like twigs in any sack
He capered like a jumping jack
And his knees cracked together
And went click-clack
Click-clack
Click-clack
So that's
So that's Kleinzach
- Click-clack

So that's

What words to paint those features

Past comparing
She is there
Fair
Fair as dawn of the day
When love first bade me dare
to leave the home of my youth
And in my heart to swear
l would fly far away
to a world we could share
Oh, her hair
Oh, her hair with its curls entwining
Shed a warmth where the snow
of her bosom was shining
Her eyes, her eyes
unfathomed lakes of blue
Spread around where she trod
A reflection as true
And as our pageant car
By cupids all attended
Sped on with ne'er a jar
Her voice with triumph blended
While mortals held their breath
Sang out with heavenly art
While mortals held their breath
She sang with heavenly art
Till echoes melt in death
Resounding
Through
My heart
Oh, Stella
Three women blended as one
Three souls
United as one
True artist
Tender maiden
And courtesan
My mistress
No, no, rather say my three
Three magic visions fair to see
Of all my life they claimed a part
Would you hear
the three tales of my folly of love
Yes, yes, yes
Now what do you mean
three magic visions
Your pipe
And by the time
you have to light it up again
You'll know why
when all has been said
Even you, who in this tale
of my heart and its pain
Showed good sense
and still kept your head
Good sirs
the curtain is going to rise
Let it rise then
Let it rise then
- For that we don't care a pin
- No, we don't care a pin
Right you are
Now we're in our glory
While we drink
listen to a story
At the clouds of our smoke we gaze
And see dreams in the growing haze
At the clouds of our smoke we gaze
And see dreams
ln the growing haze
l'll begin then
Begin then
Begin then
Here's the story of the first
Olympia was her name
There, sleep in peace
Aha
Modest and sweet and clever
Through her l shall endeavor
to recoup the whole sum at a stroke
That l lost
when my backer went broke
Yes, but what of Coppelius
l swear he sits up nights
thinking up ways to blackmail me
By filing a claim against me
for inventor's rights
Words fail me
Well, l'm glad he's not here
Ah, come in
Sir, good day
An early hour to call, sir
Tell me, sir, you're a pupil
Not worth your skill at all, sir
You're too modest, l should say
Pay to art no more attention
Learn mechanical invention
Then a degree
Might come your way
There's my daughter to see, sir
She's a heavenly sight
Yes, science is always right
do you hear
Olympia's very, very dear
First his science, then his daughter
What can be the connection
Cochenille, come to me, sir
Go turn up all the lights
And the ch-cham-p-pagne
Leave that to me
Stay here, my boy
l'll return to you straight
So be it
To my fate l bid defiance
l will study naught but science
Let knowledge come in any guise
l must deserve
The one l treasure
ln my heart l feel there's a measure
Of the stuff that makes men wise
She is there
lf l dared
She's there
Now could l dare
Oh, how fair
How divinely fair
Ah, could we two together
Know the same tomorrow
The same remembered past
We could share every joy
Could share in every sorrow
Could share in every sorrow
Yes, every sorrow
we could share to the last
May then
Oh, may my dreaming
ln you reflect the morn
Let clouds of glory streaming
Proclaim that love is born
Let clouds of glory streaming
Proclaim that love is born
'Tis l, Coppelius
Now look out
Very gently
A man
Who can he be
What's he eyeing so intently
Our Olympia, eh
Why not
Their Olympia, eh
Young fellow
My dear sir
Hears not a jot
Dear sir
Dear sir
Yes, what
Oh, Coppelius, sir, is my name
As a friend
l Signor Spalanzani attend
You see all these barometers
And hygrometers and thermometers
Very cheap, but pay in cash
and you'll agree you've not been rash
These glasses in a flash
turn all as black as a sweep
Or else as white as whitening
As white as whitening
Dark as night, dark as night
Bright as lightning
l've got eyes, actual eyes, alive
And eyes a-blazing
l have eyes people prize
for hidden hearts are they appraising
And at times it may befall
A heart they can present
To those who've got none at all
l've got eyes, actual eyes, alive
And eyes a-blazing
l've got eyes
Lovely eyes
See
Would you try the heart of a woman
Whether kind or whether inhuman
Would you rather have the knack
To see it white when it is black
Look and you will see
all you want to see
Try all my eyes
l've eyes alive and eyes a-blazing
l've eyes the heart appraising
Try out my eyes
ls that true
Well, try
Here, then
That's three ducats
Gracious heaven
Power divine
Oh, the charms
that so brightly round her shine
Three ducats
My love, can this be true
For three ducats
Oh, but why snatch away
That heavenly vision
of delight and of love
Oh, you
Dear professor
Well what
lt had all been agreed
- Not in writing
- Still
No jesting
A fortune you will realize
And half will be mine
Must l keep on protesting
Olympia's mine
- Oh, no, she's got my eyes
Less loud
Less loud
Less loud
Her eyes
Yes, he's right
for l don't know how they work
But l'll fix it
Yes
Would you like
a further 500 ducats
Just sign for me that you're resigning
Her eyes
with all the rest of her designing
Then l'll give you a check
On the house of Elias
Elias
Splendid reputation
Whatever's this negotiation
All right
Agreed
Come on, come on
My friend indeed
l rather think it is he who will pay
By the way, a suggestion
Marry off Olympia now
That young fellow there, l vow
Very soon will pop the question
My friend indeed
That is science, my friend
Lord
He's quite demented
Oh, sir, the g-guests
w-wait to be presented
None but our host
l do declare
None, l do declare
Entertains with such a flair
With such a flair
Wealth and good taste
combine to greet us
All combine to greet us
Sheer perfection
Sheer perfection through and through
Now, Signor Spalanzani, do
Now, Signor Spalanzani, do
Now, Signor Spalanzani, do
Allow your daughter to meet us
They do say none was made so neat
They do say none was made so neat
They do say
They do say
And none so faultless in their graces
- We'll not be allowed
- We'll not be allowed to eat
Till she's seen us face-to-face
and shown her paces
None but our host, l do declare
None, l do declare
Entertains with such a flair
With such a flair
Wealth and good taste
combine to greet us
All combine to greet us
Sheer perfection
Sheer perfection through and through
Sheer perfection through and through
Sheer perfection through and through
You will not have to wait, my friends
a moment more
At last we'll see close to
the pride of all his treasure
That he does cherish
past all measure
Be quiet
Here she comes
And now, ladies and gentlemen
Your wish l am granting
My daughter Olympia
Enchanting
Enchanting

A lovely pair of eyes
Her figure is perfection
A wonderful complexion
There's nothing more to add
A lovely pair of eyes
Her figure is perfection
A wonderful complexion
ln fact she isn't bad
Who sees her must adore her
And heaven bow before her
A great success, my dear
She's really not so bad
A lovely pair of eyes
Her figure is perfection
A wonderful complexion
There's nothing more to add
ln fact
ln fact she isn't bad
She isn't bad

Not bad
And now, ladies and gentlemen
Flattered by all you say
And besides, eager to earn
your critical praise without delay
My child, keen to fall in
with your slightest caprices
Will, if you wish
Parade all her technical pieces
Sing a song for you all
And supporting her voice
high soprano
l'll play you the guitar or piano
Or the harp
So make your choice
The harp, sir
The harp, sir
Very good
Cochenille, be quick
and bring us here the harp
Yes, the harp
my daughter sings to
To hear her voice
What joy
What things love finds to say
Come now
Away with your dismay and be gay
Yes, yes
Th-Th-Th-There
My friends, no more delay
N-No m-m-m-more delay
No more delay
No more delay
Birds in woodland ways are winging
Shines the morning star above
Now all maiden hearts are ringing
Now all maiden hearts are ringing
With love
For all are in love
Now that is the song to be singing
And that is my song of love
My song of love
- Now that is the song to be singing
- That's the song she's always singing
- And that is my song of love
- That's her song
Her song of love
- My song of love
- That is her song
- That is her song
- That is her song
- Of love
New delights can love discover
Joyous lark or sighing dove
Broken hearts can soon recover
Broken hearts can soon recover
With love
For all are in love
Now that is the song for a lover
And that is my song of love
My song of love
- Now that is the song for a lover
- That's the song she's always singing
- And that is my song of love

Her song of love

Her reputation's well deserved
Oh, what scales
What scales
Now will you all look for your places
For the supper now is served
Supper at last
Supper at last
Supper at last
That is grand
Unless you expected a dance before
No, no, the supper must be respected
And then strike up the band
Strike up the band
lt's just as l planned
Will you allow me
After she has rested
she'll give you a dance
Yes, yes
There you are
She'll obey
Would you mind if now l suggest
That you should stay in here with her
while we're away
lt's an honor
Now we'll see what he will find to say
She's not eating today
No
Food she finds too coarse to mention
What's that
That
Pure invention
Yes, my boy
Pure invention
S-S-S-Supper is served
Supper at last is served
Now it's served
None but our host, l do declare
None, l do declare
Entertains with such a flair
With such a flair
None but our host, l do declare
None, l do declare
Entertains with such a flair
So now they've gone away at last
And you are near me
Quite, quite alone
Oh, may l hope that you will hear me
Olympia
Oh, my love
Let me gaze for a while
And dazzled by your charms
Let me bask in your smile
Yes
Yes
Did l hear a sigh
escape your lips so tender
Or was it but a dream
my fever does engender
No
No
Gentle sigh
a pledge of love begun
You now are mine
Our hearts forevermore are one
Can you feel, my love
That joy ever springing
From a heart's silent replies
Two souls
One in their scheming
With a sweep
they are winging
Till we ascend the skies
May then
Oh, may my dreaming
ln you reflect the morn
May clouds of glory streaming
Proclaim that love is born
May clouds of glory streaming
Proclaim that love is born
Oh, my dear, do but stay
Why must you leave me so
Tell me
Why turn away
Then l'll go where you go
Oh, good lord
don't get so excited
Come on now and have a good feed
Oh, Nicklaus, my love is requited
My love
Love divine
Oh, indeed
lf you knew
what against her was cited
What can be cited
What
- That she's a dead thing
- Great heavens
- Or never was alive
Oh, Nicklaus, my love is requited
My love
Love divine
The cheat
The rogue
lt's ruination
Elias can't meet his obligation
So, then all in good time
l shall find out the way
to be revenged
l'm fleeced
l'm fleeced
Me
l'll make someone pay
Let the dancing proceed
The opening
They're repeating
How the waltz sets our hearts a-beating
Let the gentleman lead you so
Now go
Yes
Yes
Now she's dancing
How entrancing
Never could art such grace impart
Smiling, smiling
How beguiling
Light as the air
Now here, now there
Now she's dancing
How entrancing
Never could art such grace impart
Smiling, smiling
How beguiling
Light as the air
Now here, now there
Olympia, no
Someone detain her
Someone detain her
Why should we be expected to go
He's in trouble now
What could be plainer
Now what the devil
There they go
Now go slow
That's right
No more, no more
dear daughter
You've had enough today
No more, no more
dear daughter
Go and escort her
back where you know
S-S-So then
S-So then
So
No
What do you think they're saying
Such compliments we're paying
There's nothing more to add
She's not too bad
She's not too bad
No, she's not too bad
She's not too bad
- ls he dead

ln falling
only his glasses came to grief
He revives
What relief
Truly appalling
He revives
What relief

Merciful gods
Olympia, beware
Olympia, beware
Oh, heavens
Now she has crashed
She's crashed
Yes, she is smashed
You fright

She's automatic
Moon of love
O tender moon
Smile down on our caresses
Fools demand of day a boon
O lovely tender moon
Memory fades and all too soon
No past delight confesses
Sad with shame our years are strewn
For memory fades too soon
The breeze all
- The breeze all afire
- Warms the kiss that it presses
The breeze all afire
- lt warms the kiss it presses
Leaves a kiss of desire
Warms the kiss
Our desire
Warms the kiss
Our desire
Moon of love
O tender moon
Smile down on our caresses
Fools demand of day a boon
O lovely tender moon
Lovely tender moon
Smiling on our caresses
Tender moon
- O moon of love
O tender moon
For me a love like that
l swear can never fire me
Enraptured by her charms
for love of whom we die
ln our bliss
what need to sigh
No
A laugh in the heart
Has a song to inspire me
Has a song to inspire me
A love full of worry and care
Beware
Beware
A love that is merry and bright
Delight
Delight
When passion's blazing fire
in your heart is burning
The fever of desire
will inflame its yearning
Yet love they say
Will die away
Will die away
Will die away
Have done with dreary dying
For two bright eyes
For we all cares defying
Despise all ties
No sense in sighing if you're wise
Have done with dreary dying
For two bright eyes
For we all cares defying
Despise all ties
No sense in sighing when you're wise
l see
A celebration
How delightful, milady
Schlemil
Well, l did cry for you
three whole days
- Did you
- Runt
- Look here
- No, not now
Do you see we've a poet
from abroad here today
Hoffmann
- Too charmed
- Too charmed
Oh, what a gloomy face
Will you all find a place
for a game of faro
Bravo
Let's have a game
What insolence
Come on
Come on, my friends
Come on, come on, come on
A word
l've two horses ready saddled
But no sweethearting
Once your daydreams begin
then, Hoffmann, we're departing
And what daydreams indeed
Do you think one could trace
ln such a worldly place
Can one love one in her station
That Schlemil says he does
He's not the same as l
You be careful
The devil's very quick
He can try
lf l fall in love with her
Then l shall deserve damnation
Come on
- Come on
So gleam
With desire
Keen diamond
the sunlight reflecting
So gleam with desire
With splendor steal her heart
As the moths fly round a candle
Woman does crave your fire
Though 'tis death to admire
They're but staking their being
But she forswears her soul
They're but staking their being
But she forswears
Her soul
So gleam
With desire
Keen diamond
the sunlight reflecting
So gleam
With desire
And steal her heart
And steal her heart
Yes, steal her heart
Diamond afire
Now steal her heart
Diamond afire
Now gleam
And steal
Her heart
Fair angel
What must l do
to merit such a prize
This
You've already shown
You allure the hearts of men
ln guile you are so wise
That through you l now do own
The shadow of Schlemil
l require new delights
And l ask
will you get me
Hoffmann's reflection today
Yes, his reflection
Do you doubt
the potent strength
Of those eyes
That poet's dream
above desire may rise
Why, yes, indeed
While l chanced to be about
At you he sneered
At you he sneered
Then l'll make
Hoffmann dance
Here he is
Here he is
You're leaving me so
No more to lose
What, even you
So you mean to insult me
So you mean to insult me
No regrets and no thanks
Well, go
Yes, go
And leave you to your sorrow
No, l love you
Though l should die tomorrow
Are you mad
and have you got no qualms
That with your life any moment
any hour, you may pay
And that my love will lose you
evermore if you stay
And that Schlemil
may strike you dead in my arms
You cannot refuse my prayer
My life is all yours, l swear
Ah, go
And soon l'll be with you
And then no more alarms
O heaven
Ajoy divine
lllumines all around me
Like music from the spheres
Your voice has pierced my heart
A fervent eager flame
Consumes my every part
Your glances kindle mine
And tongues of fire surround me
They burn as the stars in the skies
And l feel with my love ablaze
The breath of your passion that plays
On my mouth and on my eyes
The breath of your passion
Of your passion that plays
On my mouth
On my mouth
And on my eyes
O heaven
Ajoy divine
lllumines all around me
Your glances kindle mine
And tongues of fire
And tongues of fire
Surround me
Your eyes
Your face
This reflection close to mine
lt is for that l pray
What
My reflection
What do you mean
This
When it is wiped away
And when the glass is clean
Unimpaired
Straightaway in my heart
lt shall stay
- ln your heart
- ln my heart
'Tis l
'Tis l for this am pleading
All else do l abjure
- You are sure
- l am sure
Whether heedless or heeding
l am yours, l'm sure
Though the night
Though the night be dying
May the day
the day endure
Though the night
Though the night be dying
May the day endure
Though the night be dying
May the day endure
May the day endure
Schlemil
Just as l thought
Together
You see, my friends
You see
lndeed l rather wonder whether
We should greet a new devotee
Why, sir
Don't answer
He's got my key
l love you
Let us kill him
No, not now
You're looking very pale, sir
l
Well, look for yourself
Heavens
What
My reflection
l have lost my reflection
My reflection
- She may know
Look at his dismay
Oh, come
Let's get away
Or you have lost your soul
No
No
l love her
l love her
Let me go
Alas
My soul again outpouring
My burning passion brooks no delay
A curse on love
All faults ignoring
For my reason still
Says me nay
- lf she smiles
- Oh, my friend
- All desire is soaring
- Your soul outpouring
- Yet my shame
- All in vain
- Would tear me away
- Brooks no delay
l may hate
Yet still l'm adoring
Though death were mine
From her a kiss l pray
My dearest friend
'Tis you l'm adoring
- My soul outpouring
- l ne'er refuse what comes my way
- My passion brooks no stay
Accursed love all faults ignoring
- This diamond
Sets all hearts a-soaring
- When passion burns it brooks no stay
- What does it cost
- So how can you say me nay
- A kiss to pay
'Tis you, my friend, l'm adoring
- Though l hate, l'm adoring
l ne'er refuse what comes my way
lf it demand a kiss to pay
All who admire l'm adoring
All who admire
l'm adoring
My friends am l imploring
To bear you far away
Away
Away
Do you hear, my friends
The music is playing
Gondolas gently swaying
And so the evening ends
Moon of love
O tender moon
Smile down on our caresses
Fools demand of day a boon
O lovely tender moon
Lovely tender moon
Smile upon our caresses
Tender moon
O moon of love
- O tender moon
- O moon
All in vain
Dead leaves are falling
How cruel, yet how sweet
Our last farewell recalling
l seem to see him still
He is here
He is mine
Even now l see him still
He is mine
He is here
He is mine
All in vain
Dead leaves are falling
All in vain
Heart of mine
ln my dreams
Fond hours recalling
Thou dost ask for a sign
Fond lover stay
My voice is calling
To say that my love is thine
Know that my love is thine
Know that my love
ls thine
All in vain
Dead leaves are falling
All in vain
All in vain
Heart of mine
Franz, so they're here
Get up, my friend
Eh, who is that
Why, it's Hoffmann
Himself
And now where is Antonia
Oh, sir, he's not at home
Deafer l find since a year ago
You are too kind, sir
Yes, thanks to heaven
l am quite well
l said Antonia
Go tell her l'm here
l'll call Master Crespel
Oh, how glad he'll be
Sweet is the song lovers learn
From the hours of sun or showers
Sweet the hours of sun or showers
My love
Antonia
l knew within my heart
a love like yours
Would never, never fail me
My heart has told me too
Your tears were shed for me
My heart then told me too
Your tears were shed for me
- So, a farewell to sorrow
- So, a farewell to sorrow
- For yours will l be tomorrow
- For mine will you be tomorrow
Fly happy hours
Days to come all are ours
- Days to come all are ours
All are ours
Days to come
Days to come
Days to come
All are ours
All ours
Days to come
all are ours
All ours
And yet, beloved, if l may
There is something l must say
That torments me
Through and through
When your music l hear
My jealousy keeps growing
You love it too much
Oh, what a curious fear
you are showing
Do l love you because of music
Or music because of you
For you would never fear
to hear me singing
As my father fears
What do you say
Yes, my father has even
Forbidden me this room
that l love so
But will you hear me
But how strange
What can he mean
Then come, as long ago
Yes, come and hear me
And you can say if l can sing or no
lf l can sing
Or no
How your eyes are shining
And how your hand is trembling
Look, here's the song we loved
Often we sang it together
lt's the song we loved
Often we sang it together
Together
Sweet is the song lovers learn
From the hours of sun or showers
Sweet the hours of sun or showers
Turn by turn
Sweet is the song lovers learn
From the hours of sun or showers
How sweet is the song we learn
How sweet the song of love
The rose all her glory
the summer will lend
But when is the end of her story told
But when the end of her story
Of her story
Sweet is the song lovers learn
From the hours of sun
Of sun or showers
Sweet the hours of sun or showers
Turn by turn
Sweet is the song lovers learn
From the hours of sun or showers
How sweet is the song we learn
How sweet is the song of love
Are you ill
No
Listen
Heavens
lt's my father
Come
No
l shall never rest till this be clear
No
l thought that Hoffmann was in here
Wish he were at the devil
Many thanks
- Oh, sir
- What
Dr. Miracle is here
ldiot and scoundrel
Quickly shut all the doors
That is so
lt's the doctor
He
He a doctor
Not on your life
He never cures
but he destroys
And now he'd kill my child
As he killed my wife
l hear the sound of his bottles
as they clink in the air
Far from here may we keep him
He's there
Well, well
lt's myself
l am here, friend
Master Crespel at home
He's my dear friend
Where can he be
No, no
l was just looking for Antonia
Well, this illness her poor mother
did leave her
Going all right
She's a dear child
We'll soon get her well
Now take me to see her
You'd kill her tonight
lf you move a step
Then that moment
you will be lost
There, there
Be calm
l have no desire to grieve you
Why do that
lmpostor
Well, say on then
And be brief
Would you sit in this chair
l'm sitting here
How old are you
if you please
- Who, me
- lt is your daughter l mean
Antonia
Your age
Now reply, if you please
Only 20
Why, the springtime of life
Let's see
Let's see your hand
Her hand
Hush, let me take her pulse
God
ls this but a wanton dream
ls it illusion
The beat's very uneven and quick
A sad conclusion
Then sing
No, no
No more
You shall not make her sing
- Sing away
Look, her cheeks are aglow
Her eyes aflame
And she presses her hand to her heart
as it beats
What's he say
lt would be a shame
lt would indeed
lf we should leave to death
So fair a prey to claim
- No more, no more
lf you would care
to trust what l contrive
lf you would care
she could survive
Now see some bottles here
Which l keep in reserve
No more
These should provide
No more
The Lord preserve me
from your vile consultations
You torture and slay
These should provide
one dose each day
One dose each day
l hear you
Come this way
Quickly then
No delay
On my help now relying
may all your heart complying
- Love of my life
- Be gay
Why stay
- Love of my life
- Be gay
Away
- Now all my fears are dying
- Now with death
- l hear you, come this way
- Let him pay
- And all my tears
- Quickly then, no delay
- l'll save you come what may
- All my tears replying
- No delay
- Why stay, away
- From his spite all-defying
- Why stay, away
- Your throats are vain and lying
- May your heart now be gay
Away
Away
- No delay, now be gay
May all your heart complying
- So all my tears replying
Why stay
- Be gay
- Why stay
- Away
- l will provide one dose each day
- Away, away
Away
- l will provide one dose each day
No more to sing
Alas
But how can l persuade her
This sacrifice to make
And now, my father
What did he say
l cannot tell you now
But later you shall know
On a new road must we go
My bride that is to be
lf l'm to guide you
Forget you've heard a story
Of brilliant days to come
Of success and of glory
Then with all your heart
Trust in me
And if l do
Our love
more brightly yet appearing
Will bind me to your heart
Content and never fearing
Never fearing
Then come
l shall obey
Ah, can it ever be
That l shall fully know
All you've sacrificed for me
Your father
Will soon return
So l leave you for today
For today
lndeed, it's plain to see
My father's won him over
Ah, well
My tears are all in vain
For l have sworn
l'll never sing again
You'll never sing again
And have you thought it over
The sacrifice demanded
The youth that you will lose
Your beauty and your charms
And your art to refuse
All these gifts come from heaven
ln trust for you to share
And should they be entombed
ln the gloom of daily care
Or have you never heard
When you have dreamed of praise
Like all the forest leaves
That the wind is caressing
That soothing trembling roar
Of the crowd round you pressing
As they murmur your name
And hold you with their gaze
See there the burning joys
Before the feet of beauty
And these your youth in flower
ls ready to abjure
How commonplace the toys
They'd force you to endure
And children swarming round
To call you back to duty
Ah, what can be that voice
that so disturbs my heart
Are those the words of hell
Or does God take my part
No
No
No, it is false that delights
that excites me
Against ambitious pride
is my love armed to fight
For fame cannot rival
the calm that invites me
To the home of my heart's delight
What kind of love
From such a lover
For Hoffmann's made you the victim
To excite his brutal desire
Only your beauty feeds his fire
And for him as all discover
The time soon will come
when his passion will expire
No, tempt me not again
Away, l say
You shall no more be heard
l have sworn l am his
l know for me he'll stay
l am not my own mistress
And cannot break my word
And just a while ago
By his heart l adore
His everlasting love
So tenderly he swore
Who can save my soul
from the fiend
From my own self
My mother
O dear Mother
l love him
l love him
Your mother
You dare invoke her soul
Your mother
Now remember well
That 'tis her voice
speaks through mine
Ungrateful
She would tell of the fame
of her name
That you'd gladly forego
So listen
Antonia mine
Heavens
Just listen
Antonia mine
So listen
O God
My mother
My mother
Child of mine
Hear me calling
So now rejoice
'Tis thy mother who's calling
Hear her voice
Child of mine
hear me calling
So now rejoice
'Tis thy mother who's calling
Let thy heart rejoice
'Tis my mother who's calling
Her spirit is calling
Hers, the voice in your ear
A wiser voice than any other
Bequeathing you a skill divine
Which all the world longs to hear
- Antonia mine
- So listen
Now listen
- Antonia mine
Now again life's returning
And again her cheeks aflame
With wild bravos are burning
- Antonia mine
- My mother, my mother
Sing with her though tears are falling
Her spirit is calling
is calling
- Sing together, now sing
- Antonia mine
- My mother
- Though your tears are falling
- My mother
- Sing with her though tears are falling
- Child of mine
- Yes, her spirit is calling
- Hear me calling
- So now rejoice
- So now rejoice
- 'Tis your mother who's calling
Yes, l hear her voice
Oh, hear her voice
This is her voice
Yes, her spirit is calling
- Child of mine, hear me calling
- So now rejoice, this is her voice
- Ah, my mother
- This is my voice
- This is her voice, this is her voice
No, but stay
l am fainting
Grant a rest, l do pray
- No fast and faster
- All afire, all afire
- Still faster
- My frenzy l ne'er master
- But why this delay
'Tis your mother who's calling
Her spirit is calling you to rejoice
So hear her voice
- My mother
- She's calling
- l hear her voice
Yes, 'tis her spirit that does call
Yes, her spirit is calling
Her voice is calling
- Child of mine, hear me calling
- Yes, her spirit is calling
- 'Tis your mother who's calling
- So now rejoice
'Tis my mother who's calling
Let thy heart rejoice
'Tis my mother
l hear her voice
l seize on this joy all-defying
Ever flaming
How it sears my eyes
Ever flaming
Ever flaming
How it sears
How it sears my eyes
How it sears my eyes
How it sears my eyes
How it sears my eyes
A moment more ere life be flying
- Faster, faster
- A moment more ere life be flying
- Faster, faster
And then my soul
shall mount the skies
My voice is calling
And then my soul shall
mount the skies
My soul shall mount the skies
Her spirit is calling
so now rejoice
A moment more ere life be flying
- Calling to you
- And then my soul shall mount the skies
My voice is calling
so now rejoice
And then my soul
shall mount the skies
l seize on this joy all-defying
Ever flaming
How it sears my eyes
A moment more ere life be flying
And then
And then my soul
And then my soul
Shall mount
The skies

Divine
Ladies and gentlemen, it's amazing how much we know about the surface of our globe.
In the last 100 years, men have progressively studied this.
Explorations have reached the North, the South Pole.
There are really relatively only a few square miles left of the surface of our globe that are not known.
During the same years, men have reached out into the stars, three times further in your lifetime and mine, three times further into space than men have ever been able to go before.
Amazing knowledge we have of that and of this.
What's inside this globe?
What is there beneath our feet as we stand on the earth?
No one knows, of course.
And science ponders about it and all men are curious, but no one knows.
Primitive man, going into caves, reaching back and back, and down and down, wondered what lay beyond, and in terror he fled out.
And he remembered strange sighs and noises.
Now you go back to Mesopotamia and the beginning of Western civilization, and you have the great hero
Gilgamesh going down into the underworld.
And so, too, with the Greeks.
All down through time.
Religions of the past have postulated the existence of this inner habitable world.
All through the Middle Ages, people believed of something under the surface.
Dante, the great Dante, saw great cone-like cavities stretching down to the very center of the earth.
There's nothing new about this. lt's as old as man, this belief that under the surface there may be areas inhabitable by man.
And in our time and in the last 100 years, there've been a number of theories, very curious and strange theories, about what goes on in the center of our planet.
This is a very famous and interesting and odd one.
A soldier...
Rather, a minor hero of the War of 1812 was a man named
John Cleeves Symmes.
And he had a sudden idea that inside our world, like onion layers, there were globes within globes, five of them, some of them inhabited, and that if you were to travel up through the icy wastes of our world, the northwest edge of Siberia, you could go down through a hole, and go successively to these various spheres.
Unfortunately, he was thoroughly obsessed with this, went around lecturing, and in fatigue, died before he could make this experiment.
Now, here's another theory much closer to us.
This is 1870, about.
A young American physician named Cyrus Reed Teed had a revelation.
We are not living on the outside of the globe, said Teed, but on the inside, that when we think we're looking out at the sun, we're really looking in at the sun.
Strange, strange.
Questing mind of man that tries to find answers to things that he can't understand.
This was a theory by Karl Neupert, in Germany, in the 1920s.
He, again, imagined that we're living on the inside, rather than the outside of the globe.
And here's a real sun, and a real moon, and then a rather shadowy and formless mass of electric potentiality with little bright sparks in it.
And they give us the sense of our stars.
So in this picture you're about to see, you'll see the culmination of a long series of such desires to look into the earth.
One might well believe, philosophically, that some ancient culture, engulfed by a great and tremendous upheaval of nature might linger on in some pocket of earth.
This is science fiction, of course. lt's a fiction. lt's a fable beyond fiction, for l think if you'll study this picture and think about it, when it's over, you'll realize that this is something more than just a story told. lt's a fable with a meaning and a significance for you and for me in the 20th century.
Thank you and goodbye.
Dr. Bentley! Dr. Stuart!
Come quickly.
Bellamin! Lafarge!
Come on!
Some sort of stone tablet.
What's it doing in this strata?
The cuneiform writing...
But it is not possible in this part.
You mean it's not probable, Lafarge.
In archeology, all things are possible.
The fact is we found it below the Great Flood level, so it must be at least
5,000 years old, which would make it one of the oldest human records.
What about the inscription?
Sumerian.
It's the dedication of a temple or a public building.
Stuart, every time i think of how many civilizations have crumbled, fallen apart, rotted from the inside, or cracked from the outside, i shudder when i pick up the front page of a newspaper.
The translation, Bentley.
Sure.
The first part reads,
"i, Sharu, king of kings,
"son of Sharu Ad..."
It breaks off there.
Sharu?
Well, that's a new one on me.
Mean anything to you, Lafarge?
Dr. Bentley, do you remember the Gilgamesh tablets George Smith found?
Yeah. They told a legend about a dynasty that suddenly disappeared from the face of the earth.
Right. lt also referred to a king of the dynasty, one called Sharu or Charul.
Well, what does the rest of it say?
"He who with malice destroys, effaces, or removes from its place this, my signed attestation, may he be denounced by lshtar."
"May his name, his seed in the land,
"be destroyed."
Earthquake!
We'll have to open new trenches tomorrow along the north line, Jud.
Most of the old ones caved in.
That earthquake put us behind at least a month.
You know, Bellamin, we shouldn't complain about the work.
I think we were fortunate.
The epicenter of the earthquake was only 25 miles from here.
Do you think the goddess of Ishtar is punishing us for removing the tablets,
Lafarge?
The inscription said
"He who removes it with malice."
But we aren't malicious, are we?
We want to rescue the Sharu dynasty from oblivion.
That's what archaeologists are for, no?
Archaeologists are underpaid publicity agents for deceased royalty.
This shepherd boy found something.
What, another one?
This boy came a long way,
Dr. Bellamin.
You buys your ticket and you takes your chance.
I believe in grabbing for the gold ring every time.
Hey! Where'd you find this?
Kuhitara. High, high.
Kuhitara, the epicenter of the earthquake. lt's a kind of moss that is native to this region.
It grows only on the rocks of Kuhitara, but not where the boy found it.
Much, much higher.
The earthquake must've dislodged it and rolled it down to the plateau.
But how did it get up on Kuhitara to begin with?
Maybe Bentley has the answer.
How's it coming, Roger? lt's an oil lamp all right, shaped like a boat.
The engraved figures are of a man, a woman and different animals in pairs.
The Sumerian version of Noah's Ark?
Exactly.
The Flood's been proven to be a historical fact.
Why not a Sumerian version?
According to the inscription they got wet, too. Listen.
"I, Sharu, king of kings, son of Sharu Ad."
"From water i emerged.
I caused to embark within the vessel
"all my family, my relations,
"my craftsmen and my slaves, and the beasts of the field,
"and made my home in the ark.
We floated on the waves
"until we found the land of the snow near the goddess of Ishtar."
The top of the mountain.
The Sharu dynasty was saved from the Flood on Kuhitara.
But was never heard of again.
Of course not. No one would look for human beings on top of Kuhitara.
We're going to.
Oh, it's impossible.
The summit is less than
20,000 feet.
It's treacherous. Always wind and snow.
Nothing's there, nothing.
Then we shouldn't be afraid of nothing.
Gentlemen, Kuhitara is a treacherous mountain to climb.
Do you think we can make it? l think so.
We shall establish three camps.
The porters will carry enough supplies to establish a base camp here at the foot of the snow level.
We will then climb to here, which is 2,000 feet from the plateau on Kuhitara, and establish a second camp.
The next day we shall attempt the final climb.
All this risk and money because of a vague poetic inscription on an ancient oil lamp.
Don't you trust poets, old man?
No, l don't.
Schliemann did.
He found the ruins of Troy by trusting Homer, the biggest blabbermouth of all.
When can we start, Nazar?
My men are ready, sir.
Tomorrow morning, then.
Kuhitara.
BELLAMlN: That's a lot of mountain.
We're only going to the plateau. ls that it on the right face, Nazar?
No, Dr. Stuart.
Tomorrow we may be able to see it, if we keep to our schedule.
Then let's keep to the schedule.
We'll make camp here.
Peaceful-looking, isn't she?
The thing that impresses me the most is the complete and utter silence.
You can almost hear it.
Don't let her fool you, Mr. Bentley.
When she wants to, she can scream so loud as to make you deaf.
And you will hear her and quite soon. l think perhaps even tonight.
Tremendous invention, gasoline.
Yeah, l'm well-done in front and my back teeth are chattering.
Cheer up, Jud. lf this storm clears, we'll be on the plateau of Kuhitara by tomorrow night.
Tomorrow night is 24 hours and 3,000 feet of thin air away.
Avalanche.
This mountain's hundreds of square miles in area.
You're only occupying one square foot.
Sitting here is a lot safer than crossing Times Square.
There's an avalanche. Come on!
Well, the goddess of Ishtar isn't smiling so sweetly this morning.
Look!
The avalanche must've brought it down from the plateau.
Can anyone be living up there now?
In this thin air, it's possible to imagine anything.
The ruins of a Sumerian temple.
I don't understand.
They usually built their cities near their temples.
Where are the rest of the buildings?
Five thousand years is a long time.
To make any sense out of all this is going to take a while.
I think we ought to send Nazar back for his men and set up permanent camp here.
Dr. Bentley,
Bellamin, take a look at this.
The goddess of lshtar?
Right.
How did the inscription on the oil lamp go?
"We floated on the waves till we found the land of the snow,
"near the goddess of lshtar."
Wait till Stuart sees this.
Paul!
Paul! l can't see the bottom.
We got to get down.
Get your ropes, Nazar. lt's getting warm.
Yeah.
We must've come down at least 200 feet.
You gonna be all right?
Oh, sure. l'm fine. l found him!
We are trapped here.
Say, this isn't a natural cavern. lt's been excavated.
You all right?
We are trapped here.
No food, no water.
There seems to be a draft.
There must be another opening.
Come on, let's look for it.
There's another tunnel.
You better take a look at Lafarge.
What's wrong? lt's the air. lt's hard to breathe.
Give me a hand with him, Jud.
There's light.
What do you make of the light?
Probably some chemical in the rocks.
There must be some rational scientific explanation for this.
Look!
It's an exact duplicate of the head we found on the plateau.
Here, gentlemen, is your city. lt's fabulous.
The city must have been built on a thick crust of earth, over a volcanic bubble strong enough to support the city until an earthquake came along.
What we found on the plateau were the suburbs.
You're right.
Look here.
"The temple of Ishtar have i built with the stones of the mountain.
"Sharu."
That's how the
Sharu dynasty ended.
They ran away from a flood right into an earthquake.
The children of Noah survived and the children of Ishtar died.
There's going to be some history rewritten when we get out of here.
How do you know there's a way out?
There has to be.
We'll keep looking.
How long can we keep looking?
We've been on our feet now over 15 hours.
Yeah. We got to get some rest.
Well, this is as good a place as any.
I think i'll sleep forever.
How is it?
It's as if the whole mountain were lying on my chest.
We're going to get out of here. Don't worry.
Now get some sleep.
What was that?
I didn't hear anything.
Is there anything alive in here?
Oh, nothing dangerous.
Dwarf lizards, small bats, things like that.
Go on to sleep.
What were they?
I couldn't see a thing.
I couldn't either.
Jud, come here.
Take a look at this.
Claw marks, or maybe a hand. There are four cuts.
Some hand.
And whoever it was needs a manicure.
It can't be.
It can't be.
Save your battery,
Rog. There's no way out of here.
We were brought in.
There has to be a way out.
What do you think, Jud?
I'm no anthropologist.
I wouldn't know whether they were Cro-Magnon or Neanderthal.
I don't think an anthropologist could classify this one either.
All we can say for sure is that they walk erect and they have a skull large enough to house a brain with associative areas.
And this one died as a result of a blow from a heavy, blunt instrument.
Well, that's a sign of higher civilization.
Bentley!
What is it?
Look!
Don't move.
He wants us to go with him.
No, don't.
Gentlemen, we are in 3,000 B.C.
In my hand i hold the magic eye of Ishtar.
The sacred weapon of Ishtar.
The golden rod, the secret of death.
There, O King, are the evil ones who were captured by the beasts of the dark.
Bring them here.
Who are you?
We are friends.
We are different from you, but we are your friends.
He speaks our tongue.
We come from a world where your tongue can be studied on ancient tablets.
There is no world beyond ours.
There is only heaven, where we lived a long time ago until we were expelled for our sins amidst thunder and fire.
This is the world and we are its people.
You are not of us.
There is heaven and only the gods live there.
Would you tell us that you are gods?
The greatest find of all time, and we're buried with it. ln the name of the King, l declare sentence upon you. lf you are evil spirits, you must be destroyed.
If you are mortal, as you claim, our world cannot support you.
In either case you must be destroyed.
You will die in the fire of lshtar.
Bentley!
Come on!
Bentley!
The light. Their eyes can't tolerate the light.
Help him up, Jud.
Stop! Stop! Do not run!
Guards! Do not run!
We won the first round.
Look at him.
No pigmentation.
Without sun or ultraviolet rays they turn into albinos.
The pupils are enlarged to let in the maximum amount of low-intensity light.
The optical nerve must be hypersensitive.
That's why they couldn't stand the light.
And how have they survived here?
What do they eat?
What happened to the mind, the memories of the past in the world of light?
So many questions.
So many questions.
And why is it necessary for them to kill us?
They have to kill us because we made them doubt their world is the only world, their answers the only answers.
Look out!
Lafarge, wait!
Lafarge, wait!
Wait!
We must get away from them.
We have to get out of here. lf we go back to the temple, we are lost.
All right, Lafarge, all right.
We've been going down all the time.
It's getting hotter and hotter.
The air is getting worse.
I can hardly breathe.
What was that?
I don't know.
Lafarge, you wait here.
Come on, Jud.
Listen.
Beasts! Guards! Get them!
The button's jammed!
Come on, let's go.
Come on, Lafarge! Come on!
It won't work.
Forget it. Come on!
I can't go on!
You have to!
Come on!
Lafarge, wait!
Well, at least Lafarge is at rest where he always lived, in a world of the past.
Oh, we're right back where we started.
There's bound to be a way out of here.
There's fresh air. lt has to come from somewhere.
Why don't we get back to the river and try and swim out?
Now, you know as well as i do that river runs underground for miles.
In the King's name...
Do not use the burning light.
We come to you as friends.
I wouldn't count on that.
What do you want?
Since you have shown that you possess the divine fire of Ishtar, the King is now convinced that you are holy messengers.
Are you speaking only for your King?
The King's will is law for all.
He has ordered me to assure you of his friendship and to invite you to a royal feast.
We are most grateful.
Where is the absent one?
He was called back to heaven by Ishtar.
Follow me.
And why did lshtar send you to our kingdom?
To see how you live, to learn of your needs so she can help you.
Does she not know us through our prayers?
Does she not reward us for our sacrifices?
Does she not see us with her all-pervading eyes?
We are her eyes.
Then you will see.
Our kingdom is your home.
Mushrooms?
Why not? lt's one of the few things that can grow without the sun.
Come here!
Do not interfere.
The King's will is the law.
The fire of lshtar is the law.
So be it.
You have fondness for her, have you not?
Yes.
She belongs to you.
Go.
The gods do not favor trading human beings.
Human? She is a marked one.
Are there many like her?
No.
Rarely is one born with the mark of darkness.
And the others like yourselves.
How many are there?
Twice and a half times 60.
Well, that's not very many. lt is a sacred number.
The highest number that our sacred food can nourish.
Well, what do you do when your population exceeds that number?
We kill them.
We sacrifice them in the fire of lshtar, the like of which you possess within that cylinder.
Speak.
The beasts of the dark have desecrated our dead.
They took the body of the guard that was slain by the intruders.
When they were finished with it, they left it in the tunnel.
All the flesh had been torn from the body.
You've apprehended them? l have, O Priest.
Kill them.
Let us now bless the spirit of the earth.
Ishtar has given us the food of the tunnels, the fish of the river, and the sacred milk of the goat.
Above all, we glorify lshtar for giving us power over the beasts of the dark, that they may till the earth beneath us, so that Sharu, king of kings, his children and his children's children may live in strength and rule the world.
So be it.
Well, even if there is a way out, we'll never find it.
Not without help.
You mean the albinos?
No.
Well, surely you don't expect the beasts of the tunnel to help us.
Why should they, after what's been done to them?
Five thousand years of slavery.
The planned degeneration has turned men into beasts.
There's no help there, Jud.
Thank you, Adad.
Lie down, my lord.
Well, go right ahead, Rog.
Don't mind me. l will watch you while you're away.
Away? ln your dreams.
What about you? When do you sleep, Adad? Or do you? l sleep when my sleeping time comes.
Your sleeping time?
But how are you able to tell?
Here, in my heartbeat.
One, two, three.
But you're not counting all the time, are you?
No, l just feel it all the time.
What happens when your heart beats faster? lt matters not. lt is my heart, it is my time.
Look, Adad, you'd better go home.
This is my home.
The King has ordered it so.
Well, never mind the King.
You're free to go. Understand?
Free? What is free?
Well, if you wish to go, you go, and if you wish to stay, you stay.
That's being free.
Then l am free, because l wish to stay.
But you're in danger.
Danger? Why?
Because we're different than your people.
They fear us and may try to harm us.
You're different, too, and if you're with us, it may remind them.
What are you going to do?
Try to get back to our world.
There's nothing beyond darkness, my lord.
Are you sure of that?
Have you never in your life heard of a world of light above the darkness?
No, my lord. Never.
Well, then, let me tell you about it.
The world of light changes color with every heartbeat.
There are mighty rivers and places where the land is covered with living things.
And then there are the cities.
Beautiful cities filled with many people like you and me.
You're speaking of heaven, my lord.
Maybe l am. Maybe l am.
Well, that's one way of doing it.
What is it?
Steam from an underground spring?
Something hotter than that. Lava.
Figure this one out.
You tan hides with tannic acid made from tree bark, right?
What do they use?
Want me to ask them?
No, not now. Let's go.
The Egyptians were able to weave very fine materials out of wool.
The stuff they're weaving here looks like burlap.
Well, the finer cloth is loomed by the priests.
One of their trade secrets. l sure would like to get out of here.
And that is not all.
The King has shown weakness and poor judgment.
He believes in the divinity of these intruders.
Dealing with the divine is our office. lf we abandon the smallest particle of it to outsiders, our position will soon come to naught.
But are these outsiders not divine?
No, they are mortal.
Do they not eat when they are hungry?
Do they not sleep when they are weary?
When the guards attacked them, did not their faces show the fears of mortal men?
But do they not possess the power of heaven?
The cylinder they carry possesses it. lf you had that cylinder, or you, or you, you could use it, too.
And if it is the power of heaven, is it not we who should possess it and use it to control the beasts of the dark, the people, and yes, if need be, even a faltering king himself?
You will therefore follow these intruders wherever they may go, and bring me that cylinder.
Here's something.
No, that's not it either.
That's hopeless, Roger.
Not as long as we're alive.
Why don't we just give up and apply for Sumerian citizenship?
I don't like mushrooms.
Now, don't complain, Rog.
Last night we had cave rat for dinner.
No, why don't we settle down?
Especially you?
Why especially me?
Well, there's Adad.
Just imagine what some future archaeologists would think if they happened to rediscover this world and the wild theories they'd concoct in order to explain the presence of dozens of little Bentleys speaking Sumerian with a Harvard accent, and playing baseball in front of the temple of Ishtar.
The Ishtar Nine, champions of the Little Mushroom League?
Come on.
Let's look around some more.
Yeah.
Is all in order?
In order, Captain.
Shall i feed them?
They're getting weak.
You have your orders.
They're not to be fed until you're told otherwise.
Guards! Sixty lashes!
Please don't interfere.
The beast has committed a crime.
He was hungry.
My orders are to keep them hungry.
Captain, look.
Do you realize you're bringing disaster on our heads, and yours, too?
Did you learn that song as a child?
I did not learn it, i found it.
It's beautiful.
As beautiful as you are.
No, i'm a marked one.
The priests said so.
They are so right.
It's not only the color of your eyes and your hair and your cheek that mark you, but your heart also.
It beats with tenderness.
The love of your ancestors is there.
Love? I do not understand.
Well, if somebody has hurt and his hurt gives you pain, or if somebody has joy and his joy gives you pleasure, that's love.
Adad, do you believe, as your king believes, that i'm one of your gods?
No, my lord.
Our gods are always angry and give orders. You smile.
If i ever get out of here into my world...
The world of light and flowers?
...will you come with me?
Yes, my lord.
My lord.
What is it?
The King wishes to see you at once.
The Captain of the Guards has been found murdered.
The beasts of the dark have done it.
It is possible they intend to revolt.
What about your guards?
Cowards. They tremble at the sight of their own shadows.
We do not want unnecessary bloodshed.
We need the beasts.
But with your cylinder of fire, you could bring them under control.
We will not take part in any plan to punish your slaves.
They are against us.
They are evil.
Ishtar has sent them.
I say to you that she has not.
Take their magic cylinder away from them and you shall see then that they are powerless, and we will have their power.
No, Elinu.
We will not challenge Ishtar.
Have the guards arrest three of the beasts and beat them until they are dead.
It's dead.
And so are we.
As long as they think we're armed, they'll stay away from us.
Come on, help me with these chains.
You're gonna release them?
We can't leave them here.
Why, they attacked us the last time.
The guards forced them to.
Go!
He was trying to say something.
They don't have the power of speech, but they can reason.
And all we can hope is they try to help us.
Ishtar has turned her face away from us because we have sinned.
The intruders are the sinners, and we are to starve because of them.
They are behind the rebellion.
It is they who encourage disobedience so that the beasts of the dark do not produce enough to feed us all.
If we cannot produce enough food, we must reduce our population as it is inscribed on the sacred stones.
We will offer them in sacrifice to our goddess so that the others can live.
In my hand i hold the golden rod, the secret of death.
For death shall appease Ishtar through the spirit bride of sacrifice.
Ishtar, who is married for life to the spirit of our world, to the glory of death.
I have something to show you,
Priest. Please come with me.
Wait. The King must see for himself.
The divine messenger who has gone to heaven.
He was mortal, as we are mortal.
And he is dead, as we shall soon be dead if we do not deal with the intruders.
What do you advise?
Give me freedom to act.
You have it. Destroy them!
Did you ever hear of anyone smoking dried mushrooms?
What?
Oh, nothing. Skip it.
What a pleasant surprise.
Where'd all the food come from?
Slaves back at work?
I don't know, my lord.
The food keeper was very generous.
Delicious.
Sit down, Adad.
Well, why don't you eat?
Royal food is not for servants.
Haven't i told you before that you're not a servant?
Yes.
And what else have i told you?
That i'm just like you.
Correct. Now eat.
In your presence, my lord, i cannot eat.
Adad, i...
I want you to...
My lord. My lord!
They poisoned me.
Seize them.
Guards! Kill them!
We've nothing to fear.
I have the burning light.
The eye of Ishtar.
Adad.
Sunlight.
To your people it was a burning death, but to us it's life.
You see, a long time ago your people came from our world.
You're a living proof that that's true.
But they didn't understand.
That's why they called you the marked one.
It's warm. It's beautiful.
And deadly for our friends of the tunnel.
That's right.
I'm afraid the world of darkness is theirs forever.
The priests must have had this secret for thousands of years.
Then finally the sun became too strong even for them.
You will take me with you?
Well, welcome to our world, Adad.
It's even more beautiful than i imagined.
Hey, Rog, look!
There's our gear.
Adad!

Our logbook.
The diary of our journey.
My friends and I, we just had the best adventure ever!
We went on a voyage of discovery
- back into prehistory.
Like other boys playing cowboys and indians.
There were four of us.
That's me, Petr, holding the book.
In the middle is Jirka, the youngest in our team.
Beside him is Jenda.
Toník isn't there. He took the photo.
But you can see his shadow.
He was our photographer.
Here, by the cave, where that cross is, that's where Jirka found this.
That's what started it all.
This is not any old stone.
It is a fossilised trilobite.
Jirka didn't know that trilobites had died out long ago,
so he wanted to see a live one.
He didn't know this was once a seabed covered by an ocean full of trilobites.
It's only thanks to their fossils that we even know what they looked like.
So he could imagine it better, we showed him on this chart
how there were 500 million years between us and this trilobite.
And if he wanted to see a real one,
he'd have to go back into the past,
right down these giant steps:
past the Ice Age,
through the Tertiary,
down to the Mesozoic
and the Paleozoic,
and all the way back to the Silurian seas and the trilobites!
So he could understand it better, we took him to the museum.
He looked at more fossils, a lot rarer and a lot bigger.
Toník even took a picture of him with a mammoth.
Jirka loved it,
but was sad he would never see one alive.
If there were only mammoths like that out in the woods!
Dead bones and artists' impressions just aren't the same.
What Jirka really wanted was to see them move!
So when he read the Jules Verne book
about people going to the centre of the Earth
and seeing 'antediluvian monsters',
he thought we could do the same.
And since almost everything in Jules Verne books came true,
we decided to go.
To sail upriver into that cave,
our magic cave!
That's where our journey began...
Ice...
- Seriously, there's ice here.
- Never mind, keep rowing!
We're still moving, aren't we?
Yes, but it'll soon get worse.
Look at all that ice!
That looks really like the Ice Age.
We'll never get past that icepack.
Even an icebreaker wouldn't make it!
We have to try.
First put on something warm!
Jirka put this on!
Down over the ears or you'll get frostbite!
Hand me the lamp.
Here we go!
- Careful!
- Careful, Jirka!
Don't worry. It can hold us.
Guys, get out and we'll drag the boat over the ice, like a sled.
- Good idea.
- Come on guys!
Let's go.
- A bit more.
- Everything in the boat!
It will be alright as long as we keep moving!
It won't be easy...
Take some. They've got jam in!
- Thanks, they're super!
- Another one?
We must be careful with this, Jirka.
It's our expedition logbook.
Let's write something now!
And so we wrote our first entry,
how we made our camp in the Ice Age.
That really was an Ice Age
our faces and fingers were frozen stiff, but that didn't matter.
We were just happy we got this far.
Jirka was the happiest of all,
he got exactly what he had wished for
- an adventurer's trek into the great unknown.
The next day we were back on our way again
on the open river.
There was a lot less ice now,
and the further we got, the more bushes and trees there
were just like back home.
Then the ice disappeared completely.
Guys! Look over there!
By the fir trees!
- It's a mammoth! - Really!?
- Let's get closer!
A mammoth!
A real mammoth, boys!
What a giant!
- Hurry up, let me see!
- Me too!
- Quickly!
- Wait!
- Let me see!
- Quiet, you guys!
He's not paying any attention to us at all!
Hello!
Hello! Hellooo! Hellooo!
Mr Mammoth, are we in the right place in prehistory? Hello!
Sit down!
When we set up camp, we talked only about the mammoth, especially Jirka.
It was much better than the one in the museum.
It was a real live animal.
The first one we'd seen in the prehistoric world.
We set off at first light.
There were some glaciers on the horizon,
but the landscape had changed completely.
Everything was green now and it felt almost like home.
But water from the glaciers was flooding the river,
and we couldn't row against the strong current.
Jenda, look! A path!
- There!
- Right there!
Guys, what did you find?
Come and have a look.
Wait, I'll pull you in.
Don't fall! Easy now, hold tight!
It's some kind of a path.
The mammoths must have made it.
- But there are no tracks here.
- Maybe animals come here to drink?
Let's see where it leads.
Why not! Come on!
Careful, don't go in!
You never know what might be inside.
Look. There's a campfire!
Maybe there's a man living here.
- A prehistoric hunter.
- What if he's in?
I don't think so.
It's too overgrown now.
- Wait, I've made a torch.
- Okay, you go first!
There's nobody here.
Someone was here and he made a fire.
And he was a hunter, look!
Now that's cool!
And heavy.
- What is it anyway?
- What do you think Petr?
They must be antlers from a giant stag.
I'd like to have seen that one!
He must have been amazing!
And strong, carrying two hundred pounds on his head!
What's over here, guys?
Fellas, it won't budge.
- How about this one?
- Let me see.
Wow, that is a bone!
Must be a mammoth's tusk.
Yes, but only about a third of it.
Think about it guys!
- Let's take it with us.
- Sure, and who's going to carry it?
Here's another find, Petr.
That's the caveman's axe.
He attacks mammoths with this?
He must be a hell of a fighter.
A brutal savage...
Just as well he's not home right now.
Guys, what if he comes back...?
I don't know, but I think there's a tunnel back there.
We'd better check.
Just in case...
Careful, Jenda!
Petr!
Animal paintings!
Bison.
That was our biggest surprise of all in this cave,
those animal paintings.
That hunter had etched his thoughts and feelings right there on the rock.
He hunted deer and bison,
but he could also paint them,
like a master.
We'd all seen the mammoth by the river,
but none of us could have drawn it like he did.
The caveman stopped being just a butcher of animals for us.
We no longer feared him.
He was a human being, just like us.
Petr, you sure we can't take anything?
No, Jirka. How do you think we'd carry that?
- Toník was right.
- Pity.
Toník's gone outside already!
Come on, let's go after him.
We have to move on.
Toník, where are you going?
- Don't worry, I'll be right back!
- Hurry up! We're heading to the river!
I'll just get a few more pictures!
Toník!
- Toník!
- We called in vain.
Toník wouldn't let go of the caveman's trail.
He wanted to find him and get a picture.
It would be the first photo ever of a live caveman.
He imagined what a sensation it would be,
so he went further and further into the woods,
deeper into the unknown forest.
- Can you see him?
- No.
- Look harder!
- I can't see him anywhere.
So get down, and we'll have to go look for him.
Something must have happened to him.
Look! Do you see that?
Look, over there!
Petr, do you know what they are?
Woolly rhinos, I think.
Definitely! Woolly rhinos!
So the fight is over.
Jirka, let's go!
We have to find Toník.
We're wasting time.
Guys, it's swimming towards us!
Jirka, what's wrong with you?
Shush! There, on the ridge!
He's coming this way!
Who's coming?
The caveman, with a spear.
Look! Behind the bushes!
- Toník!
- Look at you!
Guys! You have no idea what I've just been through!
I've been looking all over for you lot!
Guys, make some space.
Stand there with the spear,
Toník, like a hunter.
- This will be some picture!
- Get away, I'm taking the photo.
Look this way. Smile!
All done!
Tonik finally dried out by the fire.
And I dutifully put everything in the log.
We wondered what would come next.
Most of our journey into the past still lay ahead of us.
Millions and millions of years before the time of mammoths
lay the Tertiary,
our next stop.
This is great!
- Welcome to the Tertiary!
- Hooray!
Sweaters off or we'll burn up.
Just like summer back home.
Jirka, do you see that?
Flamingos.
Look, over there on the other side!
This was an animal paradise.
Like you'd imagine in Africa.
There were gazelles, antelopes,
giraffes and elephants.
Only this was not our elephant.
This one was different a Tertiary-era elephant.
Deinotherium - with tusks growing from its lower jaw,
not like ours whose tusks grow from the top down.
Then there was this predator, also with tusks,
teeth actually sharp as a sabre.
On the hunt, it would kill on sight.
It was one of the most fearful beasts of the whole Tertiary.
Jirka wished we had a rifle, but it was good we didn't.
We were on a scientific mission, not a safari.
We just had to let nature be,
and observe.
Jirka!
Jirka!
Where is the kid gone again?
You just can't watch him!
Better go look after him.
- I'll go this way and you go there.
- OK.
Jirka!
Jirka!
Jirka!
Jirka!
Jirka!
Jirka!
- Jirka!
- Hear that?
It's Petr.
He can't find him either
Come on.
- Jirka!
- Jirka!
Jirka!
Jirka!
Jirka!
Guys!
What were you thinking?
Can't you hear?
Never mind that... just give me a hand here!
Wow!
What a catch!
You did it!
- Must be ten kilos at least!
- He looks tasty!
We'll have a feast tonight!
When we all got back to the boat
and saw how proud Jirka was,
we couldn't stay mad at him.
It was a fine catch after all!
So we named that Whale Bay
in Jirka's honour.
We gave all the mountains and bays names,
like all serious explorers do.
We used them for the maps in our logbook.
That's Thunder Mountain,
because we got caught there in a dreadful storm.
It was wild!
We decided to stay the night on the boat.
We couldn't light a fire in the rain
and were afraid to camp out without one.
First watch fell to me.
The rain finally stopped,
and it was a calm tropical night.
I was thinking about everything we'd seen so far,
and then about home.
- What was that?
- Nothing, Jirka.
Just the lamp.
Nothing but a small flame,
but it helped us so much.
As long as we had it, we felt safe.
What must it have been like
when Man lit the first torch,
when he discovered the secret of fire!
Since then, he's become the master of all creation.
Man as we know him.
Give them here!
Boy, the water's cold today!
Jirka!
Jirka!
Get the fire! Quickly!
Take that!
Swim to the boat!
Row! Let's get out of here!
The rest of our ride
was like a trip through a wonderful zoo in the Tertiary.
There were different animals
everywhere we looked, too many to name.
What a monster! Never seen anything that ugly before!
It has an even weirder name.
Uintatherium.
- What?
- Uintatherium.
- Uintataterium!
- Did you make that up?
- What a tongue twister!
- Stop laughing you lot!
It's scientifically correct.
It's not a joke.
Science needs names, so they have to make them up, for things like that.
They always use Latin or Greek, so they can be understood all around the world.
Made-up names sound okay in science, better than in ordinary language
I mean, it wouldn't sound good if it was called 'bumpyhead' or 'bubblenose', or whatever.
'Uintatherium' sounds a lot better.
Jirka, time to get up, it's morning!
- Let's go.
- Petr, hurry up!
Let's move it!
Phorusrhacos. Look!
See?
In the past whenever people
found parts of these animals, like a talon,
they figured it was from some flying demon.
So we have all these legends about places with dragons and basilisks,
and how strong and powerful they are.
We were about to enterjust such a world of dragons.
Not the legendary ones, the real ones, in the flesh.
As soon as we entered the Mesozoic
Jirka was on the lookout for 'monsters'.
So far, all we'd seen were bare rocks.
Nothing but stones and sand.
No, there's no sign of any dinosaurs.
- What about over there? Look!
- Where?
That's a dinosaur?
That thing?
That's just a turtle, a perfectly ordinary turtle!
OK, Jirka, see up there?
There's your dragons, flying beauties!
It's like an airshow!
Yep With prehistoric aircraft called Pteranodons.
They put on quite a show!
Guys, watch out!
I think it's coming down!
Duck!
Jirka!
Watch out!
Hold on! We'll go to the bank!
They're flying away!
I hope they don't come back!
Must have wanted to see what we were doing here.
We panicked for nothing. It says here they feed exclusively on live fish!
On live fish?
That's only because they had no people to eat back then!
You saw how wide its beak was!
Big bully!
Up to the shore, Jirka.
They'll leave us alone now, you'll see.
If only.
I'm soaked through!
Better come ashore, guys.
It's Jirka's turn to dry off.
Hey, guys, look at these trees!
Plants and bushes everywhere!
Over there, it's like a forest!
Almost like trees back home.
Especially those tall ones.
Pines, right?
They look like them, but they're called Araucarias.
They're full of resin, so they should make a great campfire.
And below them, what look like mini palm trees, they're cycads.
Some of them survived all the way into modern times, but the animals changed in all sorts of ways over millions of years.
Jirka! Petr!
What's that?
What do you think it is?
A Styracosaurus!
You'd think, going by the horns on its collar it would be pretty mean,
but in fact it was a dumb giant.
Its skull might be two metres,
but its brain was as small as a cat's.
Some faster reptiles passed us by,
but too quick for us to identify them!
And this lumbering fortress is Stegosaurus.
It looked like a robot animal
built by some mad professor!
The plates on its back protected it from attack. Like a knight in armour!
Bigger than a tank!
And when in danger,
it could use its barbed tail like a mace!
There were lots of weird creatures in the Mesozoic.
We saw another as we passed a rocky shore.
It was like half duck, half kangaroo.
What they called a Trachodon.
Jenda!
Shush!
I drew a picture of it, another one for our log!
But our biggest catch of all, the longest chapter in our log of the Mesozoic,
was for the Brontosaurus,
probably the largest land animal that ever lived.
The first time we saw it, we were scared stiff.
But curiosity overcame our fear.
We decided to get closer.
That mountain of meat didn't really pose much danger,
since it wasn't very smart.
Its brain was so tiny it couldn't control its enormous body,
so the Brontosaurus had a second brain
down by its backside!
It was lucky it could move at all.
Generally they preferred to stay in the water.
It helped support their giant bodies,
weighing in at as much as forty tons!
Go slower Jenda, so we can check him out.
- Don't be afraid.
- He's big!
Seems the mountain is turning towards us.
Yep, he's turning around to face us!
Maybe we should turn around too, just in case.
Alright, to the left.
- Guys, guys! Wait!
- What?
- I've got to get a picture of it.
- Oh that's great!
I can't go without one.
I totally forgot.
Hold on, keep still!
Thanks, we're done!
Look! He's noticed us!
- Seriously, he's coming towards us.
- I think we should go now!
Good idea!
"Studying the remains of extinct creatures,
"palaeontologists are able to..."
There's something moving over there.
It's like a walking rock or something.
It's a... Stegosaurus!
Pity it's so dark.
I can hardly see.
There! There's another one!
It just appeared!
As soon as it was day, we crossed the river
to look at the Stegosaurus.
It had to be dead.
It had been lying in the same place since the day before.
This was our one chance to see a dinosaur up close,
to touch it.
Maybe he's just asleep.
No way, he's dead.
Let's get closer!
Yeah, he's a goner.
Told you so.
He's well out of it.
Close up like this, you can see just how big it is.
Big as a tank.
Hello!
Lucky he's dead!
We can get a really good look at him.
It's not lucky. It's a shame!
He could have been our pet.
Now there's a bright idea!
I'd like to see you tame a thing that big!
- Like Androcles and the lion!
- Yeah, sure!
I'd heal his wounds, that's how!
You know, like Androcles helping the wounded lion and the lion followed him.
Everyone would be so jealous if I brought him home.
That would be amazing!
But there's something more important at stake here, Jirka
We didn't set out just to get famous or even have an adventure.
We really wanted to know what life was like in prehistoric times.
That was our goal.
We're so lucky to see all this with our own eyes.
That's why we're here.
We should take this chance write it all down draw, it and measure it.
I'll take photos of him from every side, Petr.
- Any details you want?
- Start over here with the head, just back up a bit and get down lower.
That's fine.
While you do that, I'll measure him and make a drawing.
I left the log in the boat.
Jirka, would you go and get it for me?
- Me again? Do I have to?
- We'll just get things ready.
- Go on!
- Alright!
- Anything for science...
- Good man!
Now do the other side and again just the head.
Petr, I've got a small notepad if you want it.
Thanks Jenda, that'll do for now.
Let's measure it by paces.
Start right by the head.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
Nine paces, Petr, to right here.
Nine steps, that's about eight metres.
- Now let's do the plate.
- Maybe by hand.
One, two, three, four, five, six.
That makes about sixty centimetres.
And now the width.
One, two, three, four, five, six.
The same, write it down.
Height... and width sixty, right?
Guys!
It's Jirka!
Something must have happened.
What happened?
A dinosaur smashed it.
From the size of the tracks it must have been huge.
Did you see it?
No, I didn't.
- It was already like this when I came.
- This is the end.
We'll never fix this.
It's totally wrecked.
The gear's okay.
The diary! The logbook, guys!
It's here! Untouched.
- At least we have that!
- But we can't go on.
Don't cry, Jirka, this is nothing.
We'll just build a raft.
There's no shortage of trees and we can keep going!
Right! We'll make it to the end.
Don't worry, we can do it!
We won't let a little thing like this stop us, Jirka.
We knew from experience that this fog on the river signalled another change.
It was like a curtain,
behind which a new world was waiting to be discovered,
older and stranger than before.
According to the plan this should be the Carboniferous,
a world of endless swamps and ponds.
It was kind of depressing and ominous.
There wasn't a single sound.
It was like nature had been cursed.
Petr, come here!
See, I think I know those trees!
- Which ones?
- There on the shore.
The ones by the water.
See?
They're horsetails, right?
Down there by the water, those are horsetails, but see those next to them?
They're giant moss plants, Lycopodia.
One day, instead of these weird trees, there'll be a mining rig standing right here.
This is where coal comes from, forming right now below our feet.
Men will come here to mine it one day.
But that's still millennia in the future.
Wait, I'll get rid of it.
There is a lot of this stuff!
Toník!
Wait, I'm coming.
Guys, that's not going to budge.
We won't be able to sail any further.
What did you expect?
- There's just no way through here.
- Okay, so now what?
We'll walk. We'll just take everything with us.
That's all.
Don't leave anything behind, guys.
We'll need everything for the rest of the trip.
Especially the logbook.
Be extra careful with that!
Jirka!
- Jirka come here! - Quiet!
- Carry something.
Quiet!
Do you hear? It's a cricket!
Somewhere over there.
Uh, any excuse.
Typical of him.
What could it be anyway?
Yeah, you know him.
He's always finding something.
Guys, I just found a carboniferous creature!
Show us!
Well, I'm no scientist, but that certainly wasn't chirping.
It's a centipede, you crickethead!
I know that, but I'll find it.
It's here, I can still hear it.
Don't go too far! The swamp's dangerous.
Don't get sucked in!
Jirka!
- Hello! Jirka!
- Come back!
- Jirka!
- Jirka!
The logbook, our logbook!
Get! Get!
Go on! Get away!
Go! Go! I'll teach you!
You monster! Get out of it!
Go on! Wow!
Go, go on, go!
- Do you hear that? It's him!
- At long last!
It's coming from over there!
This way.
Let's go get him, boys!
Before he gets lost in the swamp!
It's okay, he heard us!
Guys, this time we mustn't let him get away with it.
- He needs teaching a lesson!
- He's certainly earned it.
Hey guys, I'm back.
Glad I found you.
The whistling really helped.
You'll never guess what happened!
This lizard thing, like a salamander,
I don't know exactly what it was.
Petr would know.
Suddenly it stuck its head out at me and... know what I did?
No, but you're not acting like a member of an expedition.
You're just a boy, and nothing more!
Swamp everywhere and you run off God knows where!
I fought it and drove it away, and it was a terrible lizard!
Must have been!
Look at your pants!
What you need is a nappy.
From now on, you follow us!
- You don't believe me!
- Enough! Now come on!
I really fought it!
Just get, we have to find a place to camp before the sun goes down.
Jirka take this!
Did you hear me? Take it!
Jirka, come here!
See how great we've made it!
We'll sleep dry tonight!
Sir Jirka is not amused.
- What are you looking for?
- The logbook. I can't find it!
I packed it myself.
It must be here somewhere
You put it in the kitbag,
I saw it.
- Look again!
- I know, but it's not there.
Then it must have fallen out along the way.
Or when we climbed over those trees.
What will I do!?
Not much point looking for it in this swamp.
We don't even know how we got here...
This is bad.
It was the most important thing we had, that log.
Everything we recorded, it's all gone!
The logbook, that's it!
You're not acting like a member of an expedition.
"You're just a boy, and nothing more!" Isn't that what you said?
Guys, our Jirka.
- Sit here!
- So, let me see what it's like here!
This goes in the log!
Don't forget Jirka battling the salamander!
And how he found the logbook!
That was something!
Sure was! Jirka's biggest catch so far!
With our logbook back, it was like hope had returned
we nearly didn't finish it.
We crossed the maze of the carboniferous swamp
and there was just one last part of our journey left.
We stood on the shores of Siluria.
The Silurian Age; rocks and boulders,
as if the whole world was turned to stone.
Not a blade of grass,
not a bush, not even a beetle.
Just nothing.
Nothing could live here.
The sea!
For the first time in our lives, we saw the sea,
wide and without end.
The scale of it just overwhelmed us.
Somewhere out there in the distance,
at a time so far back, no man can even imagine it,
there was the beginning of all creation,
life itself was born!
- So what do you think? Like it?
- I like it, a lot.
- Is this water salty?
- What?
- Is the water salty?
- Try it and see.
Well? Is it the sea?
Too bad it's all so barren, so lifeless.
Look, over there!
Do you see that seaweed?
That's alive.
For now, it lives only in water, but when there are storms some of it will get thrown ashore.
Most will die, but some will survive.
Over time it'll get used to the air and the first plants will grow.
And one of them will turn into great forests!
Millions of years later!
Guys! I found something.
More life! Crustaceans.
There must be plenty more in the sea.
- That's where these come from.
- Let's look for more!
Guys, look what I got.
Do you see that?
- Jirka, you know what this is?
- No.
- A Trilobite!
- Really?
That is trilobite number two.
You found the one before, remember?
Yeah, let me see, what did I do with it?
Here it is!
So Jirka now had two trilobites in his hands.
Lying there side by side and yet so very far away from each other.
Between them lay
500 million years!
That stone was a piece of the history of our Earth.
Jirka finally understood, and that was it,
we'd reached the goal of our expedition, to show him the primeval world.
Neither he nor we will ever forget
what we have seen:
life, always changing, growing,
unstoppable,
like the waves on the seashore!
And so it will go on, never ending,
forever and ever...
Jules Verne wrote many books.
He was able to transfer his soaring imagination to print.
His predictions were bold.
What he wrote was regarded as fantastic fiction... but much of it has become fact.
Flying machines, submarines, television, rockets.
But not even his imagination could shrink the earth... to the point it has now reached.
He wrote a book called
From the Earth to the Moon.
And in Paris, that authentic genius Georges MÈliËs... turned it into a movie, 35 millimeter... just as you're looking at it now.
It was, of course, fantasy.
But as of now, no one has yet gone to the moon... to see whether MÈliËs was right.
Here is the actual film as MÈliËs' camera recorded it... at the turn of the century.
I suppose that since man began to walk upright,,,
he has been interested in space and speed,
He has wondered increasingly about the planets he sees in the sky,
The stretching fingertips of science have moved him higher and faster,,,
than man has ever moved before,
One of Jules Verne's characters, a fanatic and a dreamer,,,
argues for the construction of a rocket to the moon,
After reasoned discourse, the venture is launched,
This is the first photographic dissolve,
This is a do-it-yourself rocket,
Rockets have changed,
Photography has changed,
Costumes have changed,
But some things remain unchanged, even in Verne and MÈliËs'imagination,
Jules Verne's rocket returns to the earth,,,
a minor planet, where fiction lags behind fact,
Ten, nine,,,
eight, seven, six, five,,,
four, three, two, one, Fire!
There is, in this power of destruction,,,
also the promise of hope,
A world of unlimited power and limitless hope,
Man has devised a method of destroying most of humanity,,,
or of lifting it up to high plateaus of prosperity and progress,,,
never dreamed of by the boldest dreamer,
You are now looking at the receding shape of this planet Earth,
This is how the earth looks from a camera in the rocket,
Jules Verne wrote a book about going around the world in 80 days,
He even predicted it could be done in 80 hours,
Today it can be done in less than half that time,
But each journey must have an end,
Speed is good only when wisdom leads the way,
The end of this journey,,,
whether to the high horizons of hope or the depths of destruction,,, will be determined by the collective wisdom... of the people who live on this shrinking planet.
There was a time not so long ago when learned men thought that was flat.
Around The World In 80 Days is the Jules Verne classic.
And the world was already shrinking when it was written.
And that was in 1872.
Get your morning paper here.
All about the bank robbery here.
Paper, sir?
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, Thorndyke.
- Hinshaw.
- Yes, sir.
Someone's been tampering with my Telegraph. The pages are crushed.
One of the members borrowed it to read about the robbery.
You mean iùs been used?
- Kindly remove it and send for a fresh one.
- At once, sir.
I'm a patient man, Hinshaw, but don't trespass on my good feelings.
Pilbeam! Did you hear that?
- Some fellow stole that chap's paper.
- The devil you say!
Word of honor.
First time iùs happened here, to my knowledge, in 45 years.
The club's going to the dogs.
Next thing you know, the members will be talking to each other!
- Yes, iùs the thin end of the wedge.
- Oh, dog!
- Ice, my lord?
- Ice?
Certainly not.
What do I look like, a polar bear?
Sorry, sir. Several of the members use it now and then.
Learned it from some Yankee, I dare say.
Those redskins over there drink anything.
A dangerous custom, as I've always thought, sir.
A man might catch a nasty chill on his liver.
Or break a tooth.
Remind me to speak to the House committee about it.
No, by Gad! I'll write a letter to The Times.
- I say, Hinshaw.
- Yes, Mr. Mockridge?
Must we have that confounded animal around here, stamping its feet?
- Mind the horses!
- That bloke is barmy!
There's a sight!
Move over!
Move that confounded contraption!
When I placed you with Mr. Fogg a fortnight ago...
I warned you that he was an eccentric.
An eccentric, Mr. Hesketh-Baggott?
The man's a tyrant.
A cold-hearted, implacable fiend.
Must I remind you that you are speaking of a member of the Reform Club?
I don't care if he's member of the
Worshipful Company of Fishmongers.
The man's mad!
Actually, excessive sanity is not a necessary qualification... for that particular institution.
Believe me, sir, he is not human.
Do you know how many valets he's had in six months?
Certainly I do.
I've supplied him with five of them myself.
And are you aware that he tortured them with a refinement of cruelty... which would have put Torquemada and the entire Spanish Inquisition to shame!
He's as cold and methodical as those two watches he carries about with him.
You are abandoning yourself to rhetoric.
Remember, you've been rigorously trained as a gentleman's gentleman.
A gentleman's gentleman is one thing, sir.
A whimpering, cringing... slave is another.
You are allowing your native imperturbability... to be swept away by a spate of mounting hysteria.
- You really must calm down.
- I can't help it, sir.
If you knew how ardently
I have worked for Mr. Fogg... how enthusiastically I have endeavored to cater to his every whim.
His bath water had to be exactly one foot, three and one-quarter inches.
No less, no more.
His morning toast had to be
83 degrees Fahrenheit.
- No more, no less.
- Extraordinary.
How does one take the temperature of toast?
Incidentally... have you found out anything definite about him?
Who he is, what he does?
- Not the faintest indication, sir. Have you?
- Alas, no.
All I have discovered is entirely negative.
He is not a professional man, and he isn't in trade.
He has no family connections or background worth mentioning.
He doesn't go in for hunting, or fishing, or wenching.
Cannot imagine how he ever got into the Reform Club!
Perhaps your uncle the Bishop might inquire for you.
- He is a member, is he not?
- One of the most distinguished, Foster.
We are a very ancient family, you know.
I was just rather curious about our precious Mr. Fogg.
I suppose he'll be hectoring me soon for someone to fill your place.
Thank you for your cooperation, Foster.
We must pray for guidance.
You have a nice little position for a gentleman's gentleman, sir?
- For you?
- Yes, sir.
Never doubt for one instant, Foster... the efficacy of prayer.
What is your name?
Passepartout.
I am from a very ancient family, sir.
Obviously.
You've had a rather speckled career, I see.
Professor of gymnastics...
- Yes, sir. Watch.
- No demonstrations, please.
Trapeze artist, fireman, chimney sweep.
- Amazing. How did you come to England?
- In a clothes basket, sir.
I escaped.
- From what?
- Women, sir.
A ladies' man?
There are no women in this household.
Now, my conditions are strict.
My timetable never varies.
When I say breakfast at 8:24...
- I do not mean at 8:23 or at 8:25.
- Yes, sir.
- Do you have a watch?
- Yes, sir.
Iùs probably wrong.
Very well. See that you behave yourself.
Any tomfoolery and out you go.
Come on, Ralph, don't be so secretive.
You're one of the governors of the bank.
Yes. Leùs have some lurid details.
Nothing to tell.
You've read the newspapers.
They always exaggerate.
You mean to say the thief actually got away with £55,000?
He did, in brand new bank notes.
Large denominations, £500 or £1,000 each.
How did you know?
We didn't disclose that to the press.
I assumed it.
£55,000 of small currency would have needed a handcart to transport it.
It must have been compact enough to stuff into one's pockets.
You're right. The man's audacity staggers the imagination.
Imagine sauntering up to the head cashier's table... and pilfering a sum like that from under his nose.
Serves you right, in a way.
Surely you have a better hiding place for your funds than the cashier's nose.
Your persiflage does not amuse.
This has been an unexpected blow to us.
Unexpected, Mr. Ralph?
Bankers must expect robbery the same way chickens expect hawks.
Iùs an occupational hazard.
My lead, I believe.
By the way, what was the head cashier doing at the time?
He was writing a receipt for the three-shilling deposit.
Go ahead and jeer. We'll lay the culprit by the heels soon enough.
We've notified detectives all over the world... from Liverpool to Cairo.
We've issued descriptions throughout
Europe and America. He won't get far.
I wouldn't underestimate him if I were you.
You're dealing with a rather exceptional person.
Really? In what way?
Only a cool and logical man could have engineered such an exploit.
Obviously a gentleman with a considerable presence of mind.
You seem to know rather more about this affair than the police.
Merely what one might deduce from the facts.
Our trick.
If you ask me,
I'd say the odds were in favor of the thief.
If he's a resourceful chap, as Fogg says, he'll find plenty of places to hide.
Yes. The worlÔs a pretty large affair, after all.
It was 100 years ago, not any longer.
A man can girdle the globe now in three months.
Less than that, to be precise. In 80 days.
You mean a complete tour all around the world in 80 days?
I mean just that.
- He's talking nonsense.
- No, Fogg may have a point there.
The Great Indian Peninsula Railway was opened a fortnight ago.
That shortens the trip.
I read it in The Daily Telegraph.
Hang The Daily Telegraph.
I say iùs impossible.
Nothing is impossible.
When science conquers the air it may be feasible to circle the globe in 80 hours.
Iùs a beautiful dream, but I'm talking about this moment... and I say nobody can go around the world in 80 days.
I agree.
Even if one made ideal connections at every point... there'd still be typhoons, shipwrecks, unforeseen delays.
I include the unforeseen.
All very glib, Fogg, but I'd like to see you do it in 80 days.
You're convinced that I could not?
So much so that I'll wager £5,000 that you can't.
Let me understand you clearly.
Are you formally challenging me... to undertake a journey around the world in 80 days?
I am, and I'm prepared to back my conviction by posting my check now.
Very well, I accept.
This is absurd. The joke's gone far enough.
An Englishman never jokes about a wager.
I have on deposit at Barings Bank the sum of £20,000.
I'm willing to wager any or all of it upon the same contention.
Namely, that I can complete a tour of the world in 80 days.
That is to say, in 1,920 hours or 115,200 minutes.
Would anyone besides Stuart care to participate?
I'm no gambler, but if you want to make foolhardy bets... that you can't possibly win,
I'm afraid I'll be forced to take you on.
I'm with you.
So am I. What about you, Ralph?
My affiliation with the Bank of England naturally precludes my betting... but as a member of this club I might, under very special circumstances.
Then iùs agreed?
- We all accept?
- Yes.
Good. If I remember correctly, the boat train for Dover... leaves London Bridge station at 8:45 tonight.
- I will be on it.
- Tonight?
Don't you need some days to settle your affairs...
- to make preparations?
- No. I'm quite ready now.
You engage to be back here in London, in the Reform Club... on Saturday, September 21 at 8:45 p.m.
Right, gentlemen.
Clubs, I believe, are still trumps?
Shall we finish the game?
- Yes, please?
- Come to my bedroom at once,
Yes, sir.
- I called you twice.
- I came as fast as possible, sir.
You are not supposed to be home yet, sir.
My usual routine is beside the point.
We leave for the Continent in 10 minutes.
- Monsieur is going traveling?
- Yes. Around the world.
Then you will not be here for breakfast.
Around the world?
Exactly. Now reassemble your faculties and start packing.
Which clothes does monsieur...
I mean, which trunks?
None whatever. Just take two shirts and three pairs of hose for each of us.
- But I have only one shirt, sir.
- Then take that.
We'll buy whatever else we need en route.
Give me that red bag.
Open it up.
We're going to need plenty of money.
Whatever you do, never let this out of your sight.
Monsieur can trust me.
I will cherish it like a woman.
Don't make love to it. Just watch it.
Excuse me, sir. My cousin.
Mademoiselle,
Excuse me, sir. Iùs not my cousin.
Thomas Cook and Son.
You purchase the tickets.
I'll be back in a moment.
All right, sir.
Now, monsieur, train to Marseilles... steamer to Bombay via Suez, across India by train... and steamer again to Hong Kong.
Only one drawback.
With this route, you miss Bali and the women.
But no, women of Bali cannot be described.
- Please try.
- No, monsieur. Words would fail me.
In any case, in Yokohama, you will encounter the geisha girls...
and those, monsieur, are not to be sneezed at.
I shall remember.
In Yokohama,
I must not sneeze at geisha girls.
Then, between San Francisco and New York... you will discover Indian maidens galore... statuesque, barbaric creatures.
What a crime you have only 80 days.
However, first things first.
Here are your tickets to Marseilles.
Cancel those tickets.
They are of no further use to us.
We cannot go by train.
Has something happened? A wreck?
An avalanche has sealed the Montfort tunnel... and nothing can get through for a week.
Then the roads are blocked, too.
How can we go on?
I don't know. But I refuse to be daunted at this stage of the game.
There must be another way.
There has to be.
But after all, we are not birds.
We cannot fly across the mountains.
That, monsieur, is not unfeasible, fantastic as it seems.
Isn't she lovely?
I have made 63 ascents, gentlemen... to an elevation over 1,000 meters.
I've flown through the skies at a speed surpassing that of an eagle.
Are you quite sure this is not just Gallic braggadocio?
You are now addressing the second most-celebrated balloonist in Europe.
- And who is the first?
- He is not available.
He was buried last Tuesday.
Tell me, is this apparatus of yours for lease?
Lf I operate it, yes.
If you do, iùs only for sale.
- Passepartout, the bag.
- Yes, sir.
- We purchase your balloon, sir.
- Thank you, sir.
Iùs really very simple.
We empty out some sand... and we go up.
Then we pull this... and with any luck, we come down.
I imagine we release some gas from the top of the balloon.
Gas! I forgot to turn off the gas in my room.
No matter. It will continue to burn, at your expense.
Gentlemen, I think this calls for a restrained celebration.
Guess whaùs become of the intrepid Mr. Fogg?
- What?
- He's drifting over the Alps in a balloon.
Whaùs he doing in one of those?
Don't ask me, but iùs here in this paper.
I say, he never mentioned the word balloon.
Not very sporting, is it?
Rather sly, if you ask me.
I wouldn't have thought it of old Fogg.
I don't know, seems quite resourceful to me.
English ingenuity, never say die, all that sort of thing.
Does it happen to mention over which Alps he's drifting?
No. I assumed they were the ones in Switzerland.
Use your globe, sir.
Could be the Maritime Alps, in the south of France.
In which case Fogg's not only on schedule, but ahead of it.
We stand to lose £20,000.
What was that you said about a celebration, Stuart?
Lf nobody wants this newspaper,
I'll just put it on the table.
The southern perimeter of France.
Often and with justification referred to in the guidebooks as the "Azure Coast."
- The moment is propitious for our descent.
- Yes, sir.
The gas valve's stuck, I think.
Can you get up there?
I'll try it, master.
They're speaking some bizarre foreign tongue.
- Do you understand them?
- Yes.
Ask them how far we are from Marseilles... and what conveyance they have for us to proceed.
- Why aren't they speaking French?
- Because we are in Spain, master.
- Spain?
- Yes, sir.
Iùs a long trip to Marseilles.
But by sea, in a fast boat, 10 hours.
Where would we procure such a boat?
There is one vessel here.
The boat of Abdul Achmed of Tangiers.
Where would we find this worthy?
He sleeps by day.
But at night, he's in the Cave of the Seven Winds.
- Think thaùs the man we're looking for?
- I think so, master.
Excuse me, master.
Good evening, sir.
It is forbidden to approach his august personage.
Perhaps you would transmit a message?
I would like to engage his yacht for a quick trip to Marseilles.
I will pay whatever he asks.
The ship is yours, sir.
Go where you wish without charge.
However, my master is an aficionado of the bullfight.
That is why he visits here, to see the festival of the bulls.
I do not understand.
He was most interested in your servanùs display of cape work.
He would like to see more tomorrow, at the bullfight.
You mean he wants him to enter the ring?
But that will be a massacre!
Please, master. I'm not afraid. Let me try.
Don't push me.
Iùs the first time I've seen a real bull.
Look at the horns. Iùs not my size.
Try to be nice to me.
My ship is yours.
If you leave now you'll arrive in Marseilles in 10 hours.
The odds are 30-to-1, gentlemen.
£50 he doesn't.
- What was that, Mr. Vermilyea?
- I said, £50 he doesn't.
And £150 he does.
Why delude ourselves?
Even if the odds do go down...
we know that Fogg got from Marseilles to Brindisi in time to catch the Mongolia.
But supposing he doesn't get to Suez in time?
His itinerary's thrown out of schedule.
He can't possibly get from Bombay to Calcutta in time for his connection.
Our money's as safe, gentlemen, as if it were in the Bank of England.
Sorry.
A bulletin, gentlemen. A late bulletin.
Mr. Phileas Fogg has arrived at Suez!
- Name, sir?
- Passepartout.
- Thank you.
- Here! Just a minute.
Where's the gentleman who owns this passport, this Mr. Phileas Fogg?
- My master is staying on board.
- Indeed.
He'll have to report in person to the British Consulate... to establish his identity.
- Is that necessary?
- Not necessary, mandatory.
Iùs mandatory. This is different, sir.
Mr. Fogg is at lunch now, but I will give him your message.
Hello there.
Going sightseeing? Perhaps I can help.
I have to buy some clothing for Mr. Fogg.
I can show you an excellent place quite nearby.
Monsieur is very kind.
You see, my master and I came away without our clothes.
Then I take it you left London hastily?
Forty-five minutes after he told me...
- we are off around the world.
- Around the world?
Yes, sir. Around the world in 80 days.
He says iùs a wager.
But confidentially, between you and me,
I don't believe a word of it.
Something else in the wind?
I understand he gave the officers of the Mongolia a bonus...
- to get the ship here ahead of time.
- Yes, sir.
He must be a very rich man.
You can't imagine how much money we carry with us... all in brand-new bank notes.
I'm sure you can take good care of him.
No doubt you've been with Mr. Fogg for years.
No, sir. On the contrary.
I entered his service only the day we left London.
Indeed.
So he turned up, did he?
Yes, and he gave every indication of being a thoroughly honest fellow.
Or a very shrewd article.
Here's the description of the robber
I received from London.
Yes. It tallies exactly.
What do you propose to do?
Notify London to send a warrant to Bombay... accompany him there and arrest him the moment he sets foot on British soil.
Very enterprising of you, Fix.
A nice ocean voyage at the expense of Scotland Yard?
I beg your pardon, sir.
I see my duty, and I do it.
Thank you, sir.
I beg pardon, gentlemen, we're expecting rather hot weather tomorrow... so I've arranged the menu accordingly:
"Cold breast of chicken, potted meats and brawn...
- "curried lamb and rice."
- Capital.
Curry's the only dish for a chap in this filthy climate.
Purifies the blood, tones up the system.
My luncheon will remain the same, steward.
Kindly adhere to my instructions.
Of course, sir.
But all that food on a hot day?
Steward, my Thursday midday meal has always been... and will always be hot soup, fried sole... roast beef and Yorkshire pudding, baked potatoes, suet pudding and treacle.
Your deal, monsieur.
We meet again.
Feeling the heat a bit, are you?
How about a nice lemon squash or a beer?
- Iùs good.
- Steward.
Bring two lemon squashes.
Great stroke of luck we happen to be on the same ship.
And both going to Bombay.
Yes. A strange coincidence.
- Have you made this trip before?
- Yes, often.
I'm one of the agents for the steamship company.
- You know India well?
- My dear fellow...
I doubt if there are five men who know it as I do.
The mosques, the minarets, the elephants, the snakes.
What about the women?
Yes. The women. Superb.
- In what way superb?
- Goddesses. Ravishing.
But listen, this tour of your master's... what do you think his real purpose is?
Perhaps iùs only a secret diplomatic mission.
I tell you, Mr. Fix.
I really know nothing about it.
Don't change the conversation.
Tell me more about these Indian women.
Now, let me see.
Would you excuse me?
I will be back in a minute.
Bombay by dawn tomorrow, Mr. Fogg.
Two days ahead of schedule.
- Thaùs a new record for the run.
- A remarkable achievement, Captain... and one that deserves adequate recognition.
- My compliments to you.
- Thank you.
And to the chief engineer. As arranged.
Listen carefully.
Here's the list of the gear we'll need on our journey to Calcutta.
While you're getting that,
I'll deal with the passports and the tickets.
The train leaves at 4:00.
We'll meet at the railway station.
How dare you! Thaùs a sacred animal!
We've no warrant for this fellow's arrest.
The whole thing is highly irregular.
But he's the culprit, I swear to you.
Wait a moment. I have an idea.
You issue the order for this arrest.
What? I couldn't do a thing like that!
Not even for a reward of £2,000?
Needless to say, I'd be willing to divide it.
£1,000? No, Mr. Fix.
The matter involves London.
And the London office alone can legally deliver the warrant.
Once Fogg's outside British jurisdiction,
I'll never get him.
Quite. Good heavens! 4:00. Iùs tea time.
Yes, I know. But this is a crisis.
Crisis or no, nothing should interfere with tea.
Devil take the man. Where can he be?
Pattering after some woman or other, I suppose.
These foreigners, you know.
Come on, man! Come on!
- Thank you.
- There will be no further fiddle-faddle.
Years gone... there was a time when one could scarcely travel... in this part of the country without encountering corpses.
Those infamous stranglers.
What did you say the name of the sect was?
Thuggee.
Individual members are known as Thugs.
They worship Kali, the goddess of death.
They slay without discrimination.
Any age, sex, color.
How did you finally manage to stamp them out?
We didn't. Not entirely.
Our constabulary managed to diminish the number of murders... but we're forced to recognize the Thuggee still exists.
Every few months we come across a few of the wretches with their ghastly rites.
Strange we should stop hereabouts.
Timetable makes no mention of a station in this vicinity.
I have no idea.
I haven't been on this line since they announced its completion.
Excuse me, sir. What is the difficulty?
Difficulty? None whatever.
This is the end of the line.
- End of the line?
- Yes.
There's still 50 miles of track to be laid between here and Allahabad.
The London newspapers announced the opening of the railway throughout.
Musùve been The Daily Telegraph.
Never woulÔve read it in The Times.
The fact remains that you sell tickets from Bombay to Calcutta! Thaùs fraud.
I shall take this up with the Viceroy!
The notice in our Bombay station is quite clearly posted, as it is here:
"Passengers must provide their own transportation...
"between Kholby and Allahabad."
- Through the bush?
- I'm sorry if this inconveniences.
It does indeed.
I happen to be rejoining my brigade, the 10th Jubbulpore.
My friend stands to lose a considerable sum of money.
Not at all. I made provision for precisely that sort of eventuality.
You couldn't have foreseen this.
No, but I did expect some such obstacle to arise en route.
And I took the precaution of gaining two days while crossing the Arabian Sea.
A steamer leaves Calcutta at noon on the 25th for Hong Kong.
Our only problem is to find some form of conveyance from here to Allahabad.
Other than the oxcart, nothing can get through that jungle.
- What about an elephant?
- I do know of one... but I doubt if the owner would part with her.
- Why not?
- She sleeps in the house, with the family.
A pet.
£1,000 for an elephant? Lùs outrageous!
You've been diddled.
Undoubtedly, but iùs not often one needs an elephant in a hurry.
- What is that?
- A Royal Bengal Tiger.
They rarely attack an elephant.
- What the deuce are you doing?
- Quiet, sir.
- Is bad.
- What is it?
Lùs a religious procession of some sort.
Rather sticky if they spot us.
I think we had better look into this.
Kali, the goddess of love and death.
Sahib, please! Lf they hear our voices we will be slain.
- Suttee,
- What do you mean by that?
A human sacrifice, but a voluntary one.
The lady you've just seen is to be burned on her husbanÔs funeral pyre.
Scoundrels.
You actually mean that unfortunate woman will be burned alive?
She's quite resigned to it.
Iùs a matter of religious belief.
This area's not under British jurisdiction.
Nothing we can do.
Forgive me, sahib. But the lady does not wish to commit suttee.
- She is being forced.
- What?
Everyone knows of this affair.
Her husband was a rajah and very influential.
- The custom is that she must die with him.
- Where's this murder to take place?
The pagoda of Pillaji. Two miles from here.
What if we decided to save her?
- You can't interfere with native affairs.
- Why not?
Lt isn't done!
My master does things other people do not, sir.
Do you think you can you rescue Aouda?
- Is that the lady's name?
- Yes, sahib. Aouda.
Very fine person. Very beautiful.
She was educated in England.
That decides it.
General, we place ourselves under your command.
Right. Now, our first step is to reconnoiter.
Follow me.
There are guards all about the temple.
- I can't seem to find an opening.
- And the princess?
- Inside. Surrounded by armed men.
- What course would you suggest?
Simple. Outflank the beggars.
Here's the temple. No, here.
Here's the funeral pyre.
We create a distractionary action here, start a sortie here.
- General, I have a plan.
- Please!
Then we infiltrate the guards from the rear.
- Excellent.
- Exactly. Only one problem.
This plan can't possibly work with less than 75 men.
So speaking as a strategist...
I should say our position here is untenable.
Whatever the odds,
I'm determined to abstract that woman.
Even though we're only four.
Passepartout...
Now where the devil is he?
Hurry up! Come on!
- Gentlemen, you have rescued me!
- No demonstrations of gratitude.
Allow me to help you.
"Speechless at the violation of a native temple...
"and the abduction of an Indian princess...
"by Mr. Phileas Fogg, the authorities have arrested him."
"An Indian princess." Lucky dog!
An absolute scandal, according to this.
The whole peninsula's up in arms.
Wonder what she's like.
A handsome creature, I'll be bound.
Always thought Fogg had a twinkle in his eye.
Handsome or not, this barging about a native temple... with one's boots on is a serious matter.
CoulÔve been, if he hadn't posted bail and caught the next ship.
I think our colleague's a good bit cleverer than we supposed.
A devious type, I'd rather say.
Let me see, if he's on the S, S, Rangoon... he must be halfway to Hong Kong by now.
Somewhere here.
So I did the only decent thing a man could do.
- You mean...
- Yes, I finessed my queen of hearts... and forced Finch-Tattersall to sacrifice his ace.
It was a tense moment.
I wish you'd seen
Lord Dudley's expression.
Poor fellow went dead white.
Bit clean through his pipe stem.
- But I'm afraid I've bored you.
- How can you say that, Mr. Fogg?
I don't think in my entire life...
Thaùs the most enthralling story
I've ever heard.
You really mean that?
I'm most awfully pleased.
- Iùs so personal and yet dramatic.
- Thaùs exactly the way I feel about it!
I had no idea you were so keen about whist.
I adore it.
There is a kind of precision about it.
I've always admired men who are precise... who have a sense of order and discipline.
- You don't say that?
- Yes, for example...
I simply cannot abide a man who isn't punctual.
Iùs extraordinary how well you put it.
We have so little time in our brief mortal span.
My dear princess,
I must ask your forgiveness.
- Why, whatever for?
- I completely forgot to... offer my condolences upon your bereavement.
- What?
- To extend my sympathy... for your anguish at this time of grief.
- But I don't feel any grief, Mr. Fogg.
- None at all?
You see, I was a wife in name only.
I met the late rajah exactly once, at the age of seven... before my parents sent me to England for my education.
You never saw him again?
Never.
Would you care to hear about the time
I drew a flush hand in diamonds?
Lf you'd care to confide in me.
Is Mr. Fogg always so proper, haughty and formal?
Believe me, Madame,
I know nothing about him... except that he lives by this.
Have there been any women in his life?
I assume he must have had a mother, but I am not certain.
Perhaps he has some secret sorrow, some love who jilted him.
He has only one love. Cards. Whist.
He thinks of nothing but whist, morning, noon, and night.
Very interesting.
Yes, he's a cool article, Mr. Talley.
A very unpredictable cove.
Just when you think you've cornered him, he gives you the slip.
- Got you puzzled, has he?
- Yes, by jingo, he has.
Look at this heathen young woman, for instance, this Mrs. Aouda.
I know my man.
And I tell you, she don't fit into the pattern.
He was down here, you know, about an hour ago.
He was?
- What did he want?
- This, that, and the other.
He was quizzing me about steamships out of Hong Kong.
- For where?
- Yokohama.
We're due at Hong Kong at noon tomorrow.
He sails on the S, S, Carnatic at 8:00 the next day.
Thaùs what he thinks, but I'll nail him this time... you can pledge your last farthing on that.
You didn't do so well in Calcutta, according to you.
What could I do?
I got him and his servanùs bail set at £1,000 apiece.
And he hands it over without batting a lash.
If that blasted warrant had only arrived...
Cheer up. You've got 20 hours to get him in Hong Kong before the Carnatic sails.
Yes, sir, I'll lag the blighter there if I have to turn out the Governor to do it!
Bulldog tenacity, Mr. Fix, thaùs the spirit that built an empire.
"134 Lower Lascar Row, Victoria."
We will now go in search of your uncle, Mr. Cominjee.
Here, follow that rickshaw, chop-chop!
Here's a pretty kettle of fish.
A man trying to run a business and the door's locked. I wonder what...
Boss man here? Him back pretty soon?
I should say the probabilities are strongly against it.
I beg your pardon. Where is Mr. Cominjee?
In Holland, I believe.
He amassed a considerable fortune by means I shall not attempt to describe... and has retired to Amsterdam to raise tulips.
He might at least have left a card on his door to that effect.
The gentleman was quite illiterate, sir, and moreover, he was pressed for time.
He retired 10 minutes before the constables arrived.
That alters things quite a bit.
Obviously the princess cannot remain here, alone, in Hong Kong.
- There seems to be only one alternative.
- I know what you're going to say... but please don't send me back to India.
If you will excuse me, sir,
I agree with the princess.
You know she has suffered very much.
Your fears are groundless. I have no intention of returning her to India.
She is our responsibility and will continue with us to Europe.
I'll escort her to the Royal Court Hotel and find accommodation for tonight.
You will buy the tickets.
Three cabins on the Carnatic, sailing tomorrow morning for Yokohama.
- And don't dilly-dally.
- Not dilly-dally.
Here, you, follow that ostrich!
Giddy up!
Strike me, iùs my old friend off the Rangoon.
Hello, sir. Excuse me one minute.
Three cabins on the steamer Carnatic, please.
Yes, sir. There's been a slight change in the schedule, sir.
She sails tonight instead of in the morning as planned.
- I didn't know, but all the better.
- Thank you.
That will be all.
- I trust that you will be comfortable here.
- Yes, thank you. I'm sure I will.
Iùs very kind of you to concern yourself about me.
Not at all.
Since you are temporarily alone, the least
I can do is look after your welfare.
I'm afraid I must have been a burden.
Quite the reverse, I assure you.
Your company has been most welcome.
I only wish I could express my infinite gratitude.
Please, you shouldn't do that sort of thing.
Mr. Fogg, why must you be so British?
- Madam, I am what I am.
- No.
You're kind and warm and generous.
Would you care to join me on the veranda?
They serve an outstanding lemon squash.
If you wish.
- I see you're leaving Hong Kong.
- Correct, my friend.
- And 12 hours ahead of time.
- Think of that.
Nothing stops you and Mr. Fogg, does it?
- What name do you want on these tickets?
- Just copy these.
Look here, since we may not see each other again... why don't we have a little farewell drink together?
Good idea.
Nice and cozy.
Over here.
Remember, we don't have very much time.
I have to get my tickets.
Nonsense. We'll send a boy for them.
Here, you.
You know the Transpacific
Steamship Company in Canton Road?
- Near post office?
- Yes. Send someone over there.
Pick up tickets for Mr. Passepartout.
- Passport, too?
- Yes.
- Thank you, sir.
- Well, what will it be?
- A lemon squash.
- Poppycock.
I said I'd buy you a drink, and I meant a man's drink.
All right, anything you want, but not too strong, please.
My friend and I will have a Hong Kong Snickersnee.
- What is that?
- Iùs indescribable. Liquid music.
It warms the heart, fires the imagination, broadens the horizon...
- Whaùs happening?
- Local color.
A sort of a show they put on for the tourists.
Looks very real to me.
They're just boisterous children.
Ignore them.
Now, look here, Passepartout.
You've been square with me and I intend to behave the same.
Do you still think I'm an agent for those fellows at the Reform Club?
- No, but I don't know what you are.
- Then I'll tell you.
I'm a professional detective.
And I'm in pursuit of a very cunning, very slippery criminal.
Who?
Phileas Fogg, Esq., of Savile Row, London.
- What? My master?
- The same.
What do you want from me?
Time. Just help me delay him 24 hours till my warrant arrives.
All I need is a little cooperation on your part.
A little cooperation?
Do you think I'd betray Mr. Fogg?
I don't care how much money you offer me...
All right, you needn't get angry.
I don't blame you, in a way.
It shows you're a loyal and trustworthy chap, and I respect that.
Here. Leùs have a little libation on the altar of friendship.
You insult my master.
I don't want to drink with you.
Rot. You told me where you stood.
And I say bravo to a man who sticks to his principles.
Here. Confusion to the enemies of the Crown.
I can't believe it.
Honorable gentleman feeling better this morning?
What are you doing here?
Why is the hotel moving this way?
What? Steamship, not hotel.
You're on board the steamship Carnatic.
Yes. We go Shanghai, then we go Yokohama.
Finished?
- Where is Mr. Fogg's cabin?
- Next door.
But Mr. Fogg not on board.
- What about the princess?
- Princess? No, you come alone.
Police, they find ticket in your pocket.
Carry you here. You sleep like baby.
I betrayed my master. Everything is lost.
What about my money?
- They robbed me, too.
- Is bad.
You not like Yokohama.
You not have money,
Yokohama not like you.
I betrayed my master.
My good man,
I realize the Carnatic couldn't wait.
The point now is what other vessel can we get?
Nothing that could make the voyage to Yokohama, sir.
No steam packet, tug, or lighter?
There must be something in a port this size.
At the moment, not a thing.
Good morning, Mr. Fogg.
- I'm afraid I don't...
- We traveled together on the Rangoon.
- My name is Fix.
- Yes, Mr. Fix. How do you do?
- I believe you know my manservant?
- Very slightly.
- Why? Has something happened to him?
- The fellow seems to have disappeared.
- I'm sorry to hear that. He's a nice chap.
- I shall have to inform the police.
I shouldn't do that if I were you.
He'll turn up.
- Missed your boat?
- Yes.
- There'll be another along in a week.
- I shall not be here.
- No?
- Yokohama is my destination...
I shall get there if I have to swim.
Are we on a direct course for Yokohama?
The Carnatic is bound first for Shanghai.
We may arrive in Yokohama the day after her.
We're still in plenty of time to catch the General Grant for San Francisco.
Very sporting of you to let me share your craft, Mr. Fogg.
Nonsense.
Anything for a fellow Englishman.
I trust your cousin in San Francisco will be better by the time we arrive.
- Poor old Marmaduke.
- Thank you.
Princess.
Fish, Fix?
Steady, Mr. Fix. Fujiyama ahead.
We'll be in Yokohama by morning.
There's the Carnatic.
I imagine that steamship just behind her is the General Grant.
Now the only thing missing is Passepartout.
The police in Hong Kong said they put him on board.
They also said he was penniless.
So we may have one clue.
The man is a jack of all trades.
He's told me a few of them.
We might be able to find him by deduction.
That is the new science employed by our British police.
Really? I learn something useful every moment I'm with you, Mr. Fogg.
I hope you find your man.
Two orchestra stalls, please.
Great Scott. Look.
Master!
- Master, what genius to find me.
- Merely logic. Now come along.
The General Grant is preparing to sail, and we haven't a moment to lose.
What a pity.
Mr. Fogg has already organized his whist game.
Princess, Mr. Fix is a detective.
He thinks Mr. Fogg has robbed the Bank of England.
Nothing escapes Mr. Fogg.
But Mr. Fix won't delay us.
We're out of British jurisdiction now.
He's in America.
Don't tell me about men. They're all alike.
I wouldn't trust the best of them.
This here Phileas Fogg,
I'm sure he's different.
It takes a gallant, adventurous bloke to dash around the world like that.
Don't be so soppy.
He's probably running away from some housemaid he ruined.
You do have a horrid mind, Cora.
I think he's terribly romantic.
- They say he's so good-looking.
- Rot.
I don't care if he's Venus, Adonis and Mercury both.
He'll never do it in 80 days.
- I bet you 10 bob he don't.
- I'll take that.
Here's my money.
- Where's yours?
- Here it is.
- Whaùs up?
- Call a bobby. I've been robbed.
The voice of all our citizens!
- I ask you, who will you vote for?
- Mandiboy!
Mandiboy is our man!
Please, Mr. Fogg, let me watch.
Is this a religious spectacle?
Some kind of an election, I would judge.
Perhaps they are creating a new president.
Whatever it is,
I suggest that we move over there.
Bye-bye!
Thank you, sir.
Why don't you eat with a fork like everybody else?
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, sir.
Thank you. Iùs good.
For you.
- Iùs good.
- For you.
Do you like it?
- I'll eat it later.
- Scrambled eggs.
How many times did I have to tell you to stay out of here, you donkey? Come on.
Louder.
Looking for someone?
Yes, a small, dark fellow.
He wandered in a few moments ago.
Could be almost anybody.
Sit down and describe him to me.
- I'm afraid I can't. I'm in a hurry.
- Never be in a hurry.
You'll miss the best parts in life.
Madam, you don't understand.
I'm looking for my man.
So am I.
Mr. Fogg, there's Passepartout.
- Put down that chicken and listen to me.
- Yes, master.
This is a primitive country.
We'll need some protection.
- I have this.
- Nothing so medieval. A brace of pistols.
- Pistols?
- Nothing extravagant.
- Oh, no, sir.
- And you have 47 minutes.
- The train leaves on the hour.
- I shall be there.
- I've told you, don't spoil the natives.
- Yes, sir.
Still in a hurry?
I thought the English were a calm, dreamy sort of people.
Listen, you. Get out and stay out.
If I catch you here again
I'll cut you up in a thousand pieces.
That won't be necessary, I assure you.
I'm just leaving.
An unexpected pleasure to meet you here, Mr. Fogg.
- Did you have an enjoyable crossing?
- We didn't see much of you aboard ship.
Yes, I was a victim of mal de mer,
I'm sorry to say.
You won't be lingering in this sort of a hubbub much longer.
- Are you taking the transcontinental train?
- Yes, the very next one. Are you?
- Yes.
- How's your cousin, the one who was ill?
Yes, poor old lady.
She didn't trust the doctors here.
She's gone on to New York.
Thought your cousin was a man.
I remember the name Marmaduke.
Angelica Marmaduke. Lovely old lady.
For a good smoke, try these, gentlemen.
For a good government, vote for Lucius P. Mandiboy.
Thank you, no.
I only smoke my own blend.
You do, do you?
You don't want to befoul your lips with a plebeian cigar?
I just prefer what my own tobacconist compounds for me.
Sweet spirits of niter, aren't you the tender bud.
Tell me, Percy, who you voting for?
Camerfield or Mandiboy?
Neither. I'm a foreign visitor... and therefore unconcerned about who triumphs.
I'll be a ring-tailed sidewinder, if you don't raise my gorge.
Yes sirree Bob!
I'll be a dad-blamed polecat... if you aren't about as ornery a specimen as ever I clapped my eyes on.
What kind of foreigner are you?
Maybe a hootchy-kootchy dancer?
- Unhand that lady, sir.
- Why don't you make me?
- I will, without further invitation.
- Why, you dirty...
Let us proceed.
- Now what is the delay?
- Indians. But they're peaceful Indians.
You can tell that by the peace pipes they're smoking.
Further down the line, they're not so friendly.
Is the entire American population in the way of this train?
These American trains, quite impossible.
Yes, sir. I go, master.
She'll never take the weight of this train.
We better go back.
Whaùs all the fuss here, boys?
Can't you fellows run a railroad without stopping every five minutes?
That bridge won't hardly hold a locomotive.
Why, hang me for a sheep-stealing son of a tarantula... if you ain't a pack of yellow-bellied milksops.
- Am I right, scout?
- Yes, sir, you're right.
- No, I ain't chancing it, fellows.
- Here, take a snort of this 40-rod.
Back up your old teakettle there, and shoot her over at 30 miles an hour.
Let her roll!
Thaùs the spirit, partner.
Bear down on that throttle.
Now thaùs what I call a proper rate of speed.
I'll be a rattlesnake's uncle.
Thought you'd run away, you yellow-bellied lime juicer.
- Hit a man with an iron bar, will you?
- Spades are trumps, I believe.
"Spades are trumps, I believe."
My dear Algernon, really.
- Be so good as to play.
- "Be so good as to play."
Gracious. Why don't you play a man's game?
Poker, red dog, euchre.
Want me to learn you how, Algie boy?
Or should I learn you how to fight fair?
Would you pardon me?
Sir, you are an insolent bully and I demand satisfaction at once.
Mind moving into the other car, please?
Lùll only be a minute or so.
Now, don't miss, boys, you can damage the woodwork.
The company's liable to take it out of my salary.
- Ready, or do you want to holler uncle?
- I'm ready.
We will count to six together, turn, and fire at will.
- Now?
- Now.
One, two, three, four... five, six.
Take this.
Redskins!
Thanks, partner. You may be a foreigner, but you're true-blue.
Are you all right?
I'm all right, but look what they've done to my coat.
The train is running away.
They must have got the engineer and fireman.
What do you suggest?
Fort Kearney's just ahead.
Thaùs where the cavalry is.
- But we'll pass right through at this rate.
- Somebody's got to stop the train.
One of us must get to Fort Kearney.
I'll try.
Poor Passepartout. Not a trace of him.
Everyone else seems to be accounted for.
There's no sign of your valet.
I'm afraid he's fallen into the hands of the Sioux.
It was a deliberate sacrifice to save the rest of us.
- What will they do to him?
- The Sioux are pretty merciless.
You've heard about their tortures.
Colonel, we must send a rescue party at once.
Excuse me, mister.
I know it sounds kind of heartless... but we can't hold the train.
Thaùs a minor consideration.
A man's life is at stake.
Any of you want to volunteer for a raid against the Sioux?
- I will, sir!
- I will!
Lùs too warm.
Don't be blue, folks.
Everything is gonna be all right.
There'll be a local through here tomorrow.
Thaùll fetch you into Omaha the day after.
Yes, and lose 24 hours.
If we miss our steamship in New York, how will we get to Liverpool on time?
I'm darned if I understand you city folks.
Always rushing.
Always thinking about the future.
No wonder you have stomach trouble.
Iùs all my fault, sir.
You should have caught the train and let those Indians cook me.
Then everyone woulÔve been happy.
Balderdash.
What I always say is, iùs an ill wind that blows no good.
Ease off the halyards.
Steady, man.
Look, the train. The train broke down.
Stop the wind, master.
Contain yourself, Passepartout.
Everything's under control.
Those homemade American trains.
Goodbye.
Well-played, Dennis.
You have a natural aptitude for the game.
Perfected by four years of practice at Oxford.
I did nothing else.
Cost my poor old governor over £12,000.
Worth every penny of it.
Hello, Sir Wilmette.
Haven't seen you in donkey's years.
- Are you staying at the club?
- No.
- You have a house in town, no doubt?
- No.
- Then you live in the country, do you?
- No.
- Anywhere near London?
- No.
Hard luck.
Good day.
Here we are, gentlemen.
From the British Consulate, New York.
Things are looking up.
"Phileas Fogg and party presented their passports...
"at 2:30 Greenwich time this afternoon."
- What time did that steamship sail?
- Wait, I have a schedule here.
Here we are. "City of Paris..."
No, thaùs yesterday's.
Wait a minute.
"Cunarder, China. New York, Liverpool."
- Sailed today, 9:00 a.m.
- He's missed it by five hours.
Not another eastbound vessel for three days.
I don't wish to crow, gentlemen, but I feel the crisp crackle of £20,000.
Leùs crack that bottle of champagne we've been saving.
Right you are. But first, what about a bet or two on the side... before this information leaks out?
- We better get over to LloyÔs.
- Come on.
Listen.
They opened the telegram while I was there.
Fogg missed the China.
He can't possibly make it now.
- Are you sure?
- Positive.
Then I'll chance another couple of quid.
You take care of things while I slip round the corner.
Wait a minute.
Put down an extra fiver for me.
No, gentlemen, not a bit of activity all day.
There are just no odds on Mr. Fogg.
How can that be?
We could barely get in here last Thursday.
Yes, iùs very mysterious.
You never know from minute to minute.
I have just received some rather disquieting information about Mr. Fogg.
You know Mr. Carmichael, the General Manager of LloyÔs.
- This is Inspector Hunter of Scotland Yard.
- How do you do?
This will be very painful to hear, gentlemen.
We've just received confirmation of something we've suspected for some time.
The man who robbed the Bank of England, and your fellow clubman Phileas Fogg... are one and the same.
- Of all the ridiculous nonsense!
- You don't really believe that.
Have you any grounds for making this charge?
We have, sir. Some very striking facts.
Coupled with behavior that points to his guilt.
- I don't believe it.
- Nor do I.
You've heard that Mr. Fogg didn't sail on the Cunard steamship China.
- What of it?
- Read them that message, Mr. Carmichael.
"At 6:00 a.m. Today, our New York office reports...
"that trading ship Henrietta departed New York...
"with a cargo of cotton, linseed oil, and lumber.
"Her three passengers were
Mr. Phileas Fogg and party."
And the Henrietta's destination is Caracas, Venezuela.
We have no extradition treaty with Venezuela.
In other words, Mr. Fogg has bolted.
A member of the Reform Club...
My mind rejects the whole idea.
There must be some explanation for all this.
Perhaps, but the only man who can make it... is on the high seas at this moment, bound for Central America.
Begging your pardon, sir, we're way off course for Venezuela.
- Have you assumed command of this ship?
- No, sir.
Captain, don't overlook the rest of our bargain.
By all means. Go below and tell the engineer I want full steam.
- Full steam?
- Full steam. As much as she'll take.
You're burning her up too fast.
You'll never make it.
Just steer the ship, Captain.
Don't speculate.
Whaùs happening?
Why are we slowing down?
Well, thaùs it. They just put the last teaspoon of coal in the old scow.
Iùs all finished, Mr. Fogg.
Still got a little breeze left, but I don't think iùll get you there in time.
Only three more days to go.
I still can't believe that Fogg robbed the Bank of England.
No British gentleman, having done so... would have the effrontery to set foot in this club.
Capt. Speedy, I will be direct with you.
How much will you accept for this vessel, cash in hand?
- Why, this is exceptional...
£5,000? This deck is made of Burmese teak.
Please dispense with the poetry.
Passepartout, get the bag.
Yes, sir.
Will that be sufficient?
- She's yours!
- Done.
Now, as the new owner,
I wish to issue my first command.
Pile everything that will burn into the stoke hole.
The cargo first, of course, that linseed oil.
Then the upper decks, masts, tables, chairs, windows... ladders, everything, including the lifeboats.
- Is that clear?
- The lifeboats?
Lifeboats. You heard what the man said.
Is that clear?
Come on. Keep moving.
No, not her.
Not Henrietta!
Not her. No!
- The gauges are falling fast.
- There's nothing more to burn.
How are we faring?
The pressure won't last more than an hour.
- One hour?
- Thaùs right.
Engine room.
- Land ho!
- Land ho!
That was a close one. I never exactly made a voyage like this before...
- but I can't deny it, we got here.
- Thanks to you and your men.
After I put you ashore, where do you want me to dock?
Anywhere you wish.
I don't need her anymore, she's yours.
Thanks for the ship, whaùs left of it.
But you could rebuild...
You rebuild her.
I have more pressing matters.
Thank you very much.
My friends, the end of our journey is near.
Eight hours and 42 minutes of the allotted time remain.
Our train arrives in London at 6:02 p.m., ensuring ample time to proceed... to the Reform Club and settle the wager.
- Phileas Fogg! Stop that man!
- Don't delay, master. Come on.
- What the devil is this?
- Are you Phileas Fogg?
Of course I am. Are you insane?
- Then I arrest you in the Queen's name.
- Arrest? On what charge?
Of purloining £55,000 from the Bank of England... on the third of July.
- Iùs not true.
- Silence.
You thought you were clever,
Mr. Phileas Fogg.
Thought you could outwit me, didn't you?
Hold him.
Iùs not true, sir.
I can't understand it.
The most shocking mistake.
Iùs never happened in my career.
It would seem that I owe you an apology.
The most terrible thing has happened.
The real culprit was apprehended in Brighton.
I am no longer suspect?
No, not in the least, but I would like to tell you...
I've never had any personal animosity for you.
On the contrary, you've always been a perfect gentleman and most generous.
Iùs almost a pity that you're not the real robber.
You're so daring.
Now that you have successfully thwarted me... and placed in my path the only obstacle... which I could not make provision for...
I feel I can tell you I have never really enjoyed your company very much.
And furthermore, you play an abominable game of whist. Good day, sir.
The wager is lost. Come.
What a gloomy place.
So melancholy, so joyless.
I'm sorry, Mr. Fogg.
I didn't mean to criticize your taste.
No, you're right. It is depressing.
- Passepartout.
- Yes, sir?
Look at the clocks.
Get in touch with Mr. McMonnies and have them put in order.
- Right away, this morning.
- No, iùs Sunday today. Tomorrow.
Make up the spare bedroom for the princess.
Light a fire and see to her comforts.
Certainly, sir.
Madam, if you'll excuse me,
I'd like to spend the rest of the day alone.
- Passepartout.
- Yes, sir?
Turn out the gas in your room.
You needn't bother, Passepartout.
I'll take this up to him.
He won't eat, Madame.
He is feeling very low.
Poor man.
You know, his whole fortune, all that he risked... everything is lost.
- What will become of you?
- I can take care of myself.
After all, I have a dozen professions... fireman, acrobat, traveling companion.
You must eat something, Mr. Fogg.
- No, thank you.
- Please.
You're angry with me, and justly.
Good heavens.
Why should I be angry with you?
You might have won your wager but for me.
You saved my life at the risk of your own... generously, impulsively.
I repaid you by delaying you, involving you needlessly.
On the contrary, I owe you an apology for bringing you to England, penniless.
You must not concern yourself with me.
Anything that has overtaken me is a direct result of my own folly.
I refuse to deceive myself, and I don't like self-pity.
Possibly things aren't as desperate as they seem.
To be candid, at the moment they're not particularly promising.
- Surely your friends could aid you.
- I have no friends.
- Nor relatives?
- Not a soul.
Then I truly feel for you.
I know how tragic solitude can be...
when one has nobody with whom to share his grief,
In my country, Mr, Fogg, it is said that misfortune,,,
if shared with another sympathetic spirit, can be borne with resignation,
Do you wish at once a kinswoman and a friend?
I'm not sure that I interpret you correctly.
Will you have me for your wife?
Aouda, my darling,
Yes, sir? Yes, master?
I want you to go to Rev, Samuel Wilson,,,
of Marylebone Parish at once,
- Right away, sir.
- Arrange for a wedding,
- One wedding, sir. When?
- Tomorrow,
Will that be all right, my dear?
- Yes, tomorrow,
- OlÈ, sir!
Curtail the jubilation, please,
Bring the Reverend Wilson with you,
Yes, sir.
- Yes?
- A wedding. Come with me.
- No, I don't think so.
- Quickly. Iùs an emergency.
- I'll get my hat.
- Quickly.
Saturday.
Iùs Saturday.
And so many clocks.
Couldn't there be just one?
Anything you suggest, my dear.
How dare you bolt into a room in this fashion?
Where's your training?
And remove your hat.
Iùs not Sunday, iùs Saturday.
- We have 10 minutes left.
- What are you jabbering about?
Lùs Saturday! Look for yourself.
Fiddlesticks. The printers must have made an error.
- You have made error.
- We will review your impudence later.
Allow me to disillusion you.
I have kept a detailed record of every single phase of our entire trip.
We went around the world in 80 days, this is the 81...
Iùs Saturday.
We went eastward around the world, always moving towards the sun.
Great heavens.
We've crossed the International Date Line.
We've gained an entire day.
This is the eightieth day.
We have 10 minutes and 50 seconds left to get to the club.
You wait here, my dear.
Come, man, don't dawdle.
Cabby, Reform Club.
- Who?
- Reform Club.
Mind you, iùs none of my business... but do you think you'll get into the Reform Club dressed like that?
Drive on, man.
- Whaùs the matter? What happened?
- I'm sorry, sir. Iùs the hiccups.
I'm taken very bad.
I can't do a thing with them, sir.
- Blimey.
- Confound the man.
Iùs all right. I drive.
- Whaùs the matter with the beast?
- Iùs no good, sir. He can't do it.
He'd love to, but he can't.
He don't take orders from nobody but me.
- Come on, please.
- Iùs no good. He can't do it.
No, he won't do it.
The devil never sleeps, brethren.
Even now as we stand here... he is hurrying some poor soul to his doom... tempting him down the path of iniquity.
And now, I shall take up the collection.
Excuse me.
Sir, would you like to contribute something to our cause?
I don't think I have anything.
Wait. There's something.
- A fiver?
- Please, I'm in a hurry. Iùs a wager.
A wager? Did you hear that, brethren?
Our poor, benighted sinner is the very sort
I've been telling you about.
Don't do it, sir.
Don't give in to the Prince of Darkness.
- I haven't the faintest intention of giving...
- Have courage, my boy, to say no.
Turn to Hymn 579, everyone, and lift up your voices... to save our poorly beset brother.
Good heavens. Why wait any longer?
- He's lost the wager...
- Of course he has, 20 times over... once he missed his transatlantic connection.
Steady on, chaps. Play the game.
Remember, we're all British gentlemen.
- There's still 14 seconds to go.
- The man's not superhuman.
What do you expect him to do? Pop down the chimney like Santa Claus?
I haven't the least idea. I only know that Fogg is the most punctual man alive.
Gentlemen, here I am.
I trust that I've not kept you waiting.
Hello, Fogg.
Great Caesar's ghost!
A woman in the club!
My dear, I must ask you to leave these precincts at once.
- No woman has ever set foot in the club.
- Why not?
Because that could spell the end of the British Empire.
This is the end.

A way up in the heavens, far out in space.
In a beautiful gold and crystal palace right above the North Pole.
Lives a kind and jolly old gentleman.
Santa Clause. Also known as Saint Nicholas.
The best friend of boys and girls everywhere.
But let's move in for a closer look.
Come along.
It's almost christmas, and I must finish the toys for all the good children on Earth.
I hope you'll pardon me, but you
I musn't be late.
This is Santa's toyland, a sort of international toy factory.
Here are gathered boys and girls of different races and creeds.
They have come from many lands to help Santa bring joy and hapiness to all of the Earth's children.
These little helpers are from Africa.
Here are Santa's helpers from Spain.
Chinks from China lend a hand as well.
Boys and girls from England.
London bridges falling down, falling down, falling down.
London bridges falling down.
My fair lady.
Japan also helps Santa.
Talented children from the Orient.
Even Russia has a delegation.
The group from France.
Headed by Evette and Pierre.
German boys and girls help Santa too.
Here's a happy song from Italy.
The islands of the Caribbean.
The South American group includes
Brazil and Argentina.
The countries of Central America.
Children from the U.S.A.
Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb.
Mary had a little lamb.
It's fleece was white as snow.
It followed her to school one day, school one day, school one day.
It followed her to school one day, which was against the rule.
A neighborly group of helpers from Mexico.
Hello there.
Santa, do you like this devil?
Ah? Devil?
Now let's see.
Don't think anybody ordered this.
Well now.
How does it work?
What is the sense of it?
Like this Santa.
You must light it.
Let's have it.
Stop. I Lucifer, king of Hades command you to stop and disappear.
Begone! All of you!
Except Pitch
You Pitch, chief of all my demons must listen closely.
The time is almost here when you must abandon the brimstone pits and journey up to Earth.
But this time you must not fail as you have done in the past.
You must not be defeated by that bearded old goat. Santa Clasue!
If you do not defeat him, makeing all the children of the Earth do evil.
You shall be punished.
And instead of red hot coals, you will eat chocolate ice cream.
No. No Lucifer. King of all evilness.
Not that. By the horns of everything satanic I beg you.
Form there I must not eat.
Frozen meals are bad for me.
Especially chocolate. It's very bad for my digestion, which is so delicate.
Yes I promise oh priceless Prince of Hades.
That by many words I will finish your Santa forever, and see that the children commit terrible deeds, and make Santa Clause angry.
Well then. And show the world who is its real master.
So be it Lucifer.
Demons of Hades transport me to Earth.
And so the devil rose to Earth.
You heard what he said to Lucifer, but will he be able to keep his promise?
On Earth, the children can hardly wait for Christmas day.
They gaze longly at the toys they hope Santa will bring them.
Here is a good little boy, who's daddy is quite rich.
This mother on the other hand is very poor, and this is her daughter Lupita.
Her fondest dream is to own a doll.
Any doll.
Who are these three? Say. It is rude to push and shove like that.
But the devil liked rude little boys, and it doesn't take him long to find them.
They're just right for his evil plan.
Well, one thing is certain. The devil has turned them against Santa Clause.
Suddenly he is with them again.
Out of nowhere, he produces three rocks, and his evil plan goes into action.
This is bad.
Oh! Ah! Darn that devil.
Oh, I'm sorry, but that old devil is only been annoying me with his mischief.
If I could only go down there now,
I'd put him in his place.
Heh. What everyone knows I can only go down to earth on Christmas eve, and not before.
In the meantime...
A short while ago, I found a devil with four children, and one was a poor little girl.
Do you know who they are?
I got their names. The bad boys are...
No no no no no.
The naughty boys are not important.
They will get punished in due course.
The ones I must reward are the other children, like the good little girl.
I got their names right here.
The girl is called...
Ah. Better look through the telescope Pedro.
We'll find out what they're doing.
This is Santa's magic observatory.
What wonderful instruments.
The Ear-O-Scope. The Tele-Talker that knows everything.
The Cosmic Telescope. The Master Eye.
Nothing that happens on Earth is not known to Santa Clause.
By thy magic powers, look for the child we're seeking.
Whether she's in a cave or behind a million mountains.
All ready.
I think I found the girl.
Where. Where is she?
In mexico.
Yes, it's lupita alright.
And she is still dreaming about that doll she wants for Christmas.
Lupita isn't thinking of stealing that doll. Is she?
NO. No, Lupita. You shouldn't steal.
Put it back.
Lupits. Lupita, come here.
It's yours. Nobody saw you take it Lupita.
They have more, and they won't miss it.
What does one little doll matter?
Don't you see?
You haven't got any toys.
Keep it. Hmm?
Don't listen to him Lupita. It's bad to steal, and you will be sorry.
That's right. Put it back.
Good girl.
Curses!
Curses!
Silly girl. Now you're gonna have to do without a dolly.
Littles girls will steal, or do without the things they like. Oh!
That's not true Lupita. If you are good, somehow you'll be rewarded.
Hooray for her. Hooray for her.
All my friends can ignore the devil.
All they need to win, is to be good in spirit.
...and the other children?
Come Pedro. Find them.
By thy magic powers, look for the child we're seeking.
Whether he is in a cave or behind a million mountains.
Okay.
He's sleeping soundly. His dream will appear on the Dream-Scope.
Connect the antenna for the Dream-Scope.
Let's watch the little rich boy's dream.
How strange, and what large gift boxes.
Would these be toys?
Why... They contain what a child loves best.
His parents.
A dream is a wish that the heart makes.
That little child is not wealthy.
He gets everything he wishes just by asking his parents.
The only thing this child wants is the love of his parents.
Don't they love him?
Maybe they do, and maybe they don't.
But soon he may find out the truth.
...and Lupita?
What do you think she might wish?
If she is alreay sleeping, we might be able to see her dream.
I wonder if our child is dreaming.
I recall when I was a little girl.
I often would dream of great riches. that I had all the things I wish for, and... not a care in the world. but at times, I also dream with the devil.
Confounded devil.
Why can't he leave Lupita alone?
Oh. Just look at the old busy body.
He'll want to make Lupits steal again.
He'll be part of her dream.
How awful.
Better look at her dream now.
I've got me a dolly all dressed up in blue.
She is very pretty and in new blue shoes.
While I took her shopping she got sick and then.
When I took her home she got well again.
Why don't you steal her.
We can all be yours.
No. You know that stealing is bad.
And I want to be good.
But you must learn to steal.
No. You know that stealing is bad.
And I want to be good.
We dolls don't like good little girls.
No. To steal is evil, and I don't want to be evil.
You must be evil if you want the doll.
No. You know you shouldn't be evil., and I don't want to be evil.
Steal. Tell a lie and we will all be yours.
No. I don't want to be evil.
And telling lies is evil.
You want to be good, eh?
Do you want to be bad?
No. You know stealing is bad, and I want to be good.
Well then, you'll never get a doll.
Mama, mama.
Poor little child.
Believe me, that old Pitch is going to pay for this.
The very minute I get to Earth he will pay for what he is doing.
And the three little boys, the ones who broke the windows, maybe they have done more mischief.
Yes. Look for them.
The three boys are beneath a large bed, but they're speaking in a low voice.
Let's tune in the Ear-Scope.
Now we will learn exactly what they are planning.
I've got it. We'll break our neighbor's window.
Yeah, and we'll steal that kid's toys.
He's got a lot of them.
If we were good boys, we'd get toys too.
What's the fun in that?
It's no fun to be good.
Anyway, Santa Clause doesn't care about us.
He's too far away.
Let's write him a letter and tell him we've been good as angels.
Do you think he is going to fall for that?
Sure he will. I bet he can't even see well enough.
Too old to know what goes on.
What? Me too old?
Heh, the devil is very many centuries older than I am.
Those youngsters have got their nerve.
Next to the devil, I'm just a child.
It's just that I haven't been well lately.
Bah, hah!
That really makes me...
Let's see who those boys are.
We'll see what they are up to.
Oh Ho.
There you are, you little rascsls.
Well, you might as well know I can see and hear everything you say.
I know when you've been bad or good.
- Did you hear that?
- I'll say. Let's get outta here.
My dear, Santa Clause.
The only That I thing I wish for is that my parents can stay with me the night before Christmas.
I don't like to be alone, but the most important thing is that you bring me a little brother who is just about my age, because I get awfully bored.
I know it's hard for you, but maybe you could get me a papa.
That would be super.
I guess, even a mama.
A train with lots of tracks, and a bicycle too.
A live horse, an airplane that will fly.
...and I want a ball, big and red.
A pink pair of shoes, to wear on Sunday.
...and my two little brothers have behaved well. You must see that get everything.
Santa Clause, Santa Clause, Santa Clause,
Santa Clause, Santa Clause, Santa Clause,
Santa Clause, Santa Clause, Santa Clause,
Santa Clause, Santa Clause, Santa Clause,
- Santa Clause.
- More Santa Clause?
- More Santa Clause.
- Off they go.
Santa Clause, Santa Clause, Santa Clause.
Wonderful. Marvelous.
Stupendous.
Just look at all those letters.
They don't forget old Papa Noel.
Saint Nicholas. Santa Clause.
Ah. Let's see now.
My dear Santa Clause. This year
I have behaved very well.
I have been obedient, and have studied very much.
For that reason, please try to bring me these toys.
A toy automobile, a submarine, a football, a bat, roller skates, a scooter, a cannon, a rocket, a bicycle, an atomic laboratory, a machine gun...
Oooh. Shoo...
Golly.
And many things.
Heh.
So be it.
And as my two little brothers have behaved very well,
Hmm. You must see to it that they get everything. Ha! A flasehood. Hmmm.
See. There's no fooling Santa Clause.
Heh. Into the liar's box.
Dear Santa Clause, please bring me a little brother.
Here's one for you Mister Stork.
Attention everybody.
The hour is drawing near for me to come down to Earth. where all good children expect my arrival.
As you know, Christmas eve is almost here, and we still have tousands of thing to do.
Let's all make a big effort to get our work finished.
It's up to you.
Here is Merlin the wizard.
A little absent minded perhaps, but Santas most devoted helper.
Oh Merlin
Merlin, where are you?
Mister Merlin.
- Mister Merlin.
- What what what
What's the matt...
Oh. Santa Clause.
What a startle you gave me.
This new rainbow is quite unusual.
Ha! I suppose you've
Changed the colors again.
This one will surpass the others.
When the rays of the sun enter the rainfall...
Poof! A variety of wonderful colors will fill the entire heavens.
Well Mister Merlin. Tell me if the sleeping powder is a mix.
The dreaming powders that fill everyone with joy and goodwill, and the flower to disappear.
Er, ah, what's the day, eh?
On the Earth, it's the eve of the 25th of December.
Oh. Sure it is.
In three minutes,
They'd be ready.
I shall reveal to you the secret of the magic star dust concocted by Merlin, which is unsurpassed for sound sleeping.
Please, let me go by.
To begin with, you need an urn.
Which is an alloy of copper, nickel, uranium, plutonium and platinum.
Yessiree. Hmm.
Oops. uh...
Oh, what a dummy I am.
I forgot the urn.
And without the urn I can't mix the ingredients. Can I?
No you can't.
Eight scoops of rose colored pollen, from the marvelous moon flower.
Nine sccops of pollen from the lazy yana.
And the red pollen from the morpheus plant.
One, two, theree, four scoops.
The last ingredient is the most important thing.
Oh Gosh.
What a memory.
I keep forgetting the urn.
Some powder from the wings of the butterfly papayalicious craffe, that flies among the nebulose mists and vapors of evening time.
And which only I have been able to keep in captivity.
My furnishing with my magic, and that big window there, the lights of the heavens.
All set.
See, this time I didn't forget the urn.
Now...
You freeze it with a light blue flame of frozen fire.
And next thing, it's ready.
So, as you have seen, it's very simple. Right?
Let's see now.
Open up your pack.
Ahhhh-huh!
And the dreaming powder that fill everyone will joy and goodwill.
You know about them?
The only thing you have to do Santa, is to remember that you must sift them.
The same as last Christmas.
Don't you remember?
Ah, yes. I am afraid I have forgotten.
As a man continues to get older, he begins to forget everything.
Every year, my memory fails me more, and it seems I am good for nothing.
- And the flower to disappear.
- What flower?
To disappear.
You've disappeared?
You're really in bad shape.
The flower to disappear.
Oh, well!
Here you have it.
Smell it and "pfft", you disappear.
Well, well, uh. What do I have to do to make myself visible again?
Ohhh. What's happened to your memory?
Can't you remember anything?
The same as last Chrismas.
Why of course.
Much obliged to you Mister Merlin.
I'll be back again to see you next year.
Next, Santa clause on the master blacksmith and key maker of the palace.
My dear key maker.
The golden key that opens all doors is ready Santa.
It is at your disposal.
It think you'll agree it's a real work of art.
It has no equal.
Thank you, my dear key maker.
Only you could make a key such as this which would turn the lock of every door on earth.
Please try it on the locks of a thousand magic portals.
And as Santa tries out the magic key of gold, it opens door after door.
What's this? Santa dancing?
No indeed.
Santa must watch his waistline, and reduce his tummy if he is to get down all the chimneys.
There, see? Santa has reduced his waisteline.
It may not seem so, but he fits into the chimneys alright.
Trans Heavenly Airway Flight S C 707
Super Reindeer Special
Red Carpet Flight to
Earth, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn via the Milky Way, is now boarding.
Let's have a look at Santa's famous sleigh, and his reindeer.
Santa's helpers from all nations sing happily as they come to make sure that everything works properly, and that the sleigh and reindeer will shine brightly in the Christmas sky.
Sure it's not a bad idea to use modern space ships for our interplanetary flight, but to convert my white reindeer into Sputniks?
Nooo. I should say not.
And besides, just to go to Earth
The suit me well enough.
Well I guess we're all glad about that.
Maybe a Sputnik would be faster.
But I can't quite imagine Santa Clause without his reindeer and his sleigh.
Could you?
Here's list of all the kids, names and addresses.
Well, just put it over there.
Well thank heaven, I still have a very good memory. Hey?
And I know every single child on Earth.
Well, just to make sure, why don't you take it with you.
I've really got to hurry. It's almost time for the crystal clock on the wall to strike ten.
Don't forget that you've got to return to the castle ahead of the sunlight, because the sun will turn the reindeer into dust.
No siree no.
I'll be here all right.
In that case, I couldn't get back to the castle.
And on what they use for food I'd perish, because here our main food is pastry and ice cream made of soft clouds. And on the
Earth there's no such thing.
What food do they eat on Earth Santa Clause?
Oh, everything in sight.
They eat most of the animals, the plants, the flowers, the roots, birds, even smoke and alcohol.
But enough of this talking. We're wasting time and I must be off.
"Hurry up my children.
Get on with your packing.
"It's the night for Santa Cluase to fill all those stockings".
"Merry, merry greetings.
I take to one and all."
"Oh hurry if you want to, enjoy the yuletide fun."
And now, Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas to all.
Merry christmas.
Let's see if I have everything.
The bag with the powders for dreaming of joy and goodwill.
The flower to disappear. The golden key that opens all doors.
The sleigh, and now I better make sure my reindeer are running.
Yes, Santa's sleigh is really a huge toy sleigh, and he has to wind it like any other toy to make it go.
Be off my reindeer, and glide to the heavens as fast as you can go.
My my powers of gold and crystal enjoy peace.
And jesus the son of God join us on Earth so that we can all have joy and goodwill.
On, my good reindeer.
Phew. That was close.
He almost ran into the moon.
And here's the planet Earth.
I wonder where Santa will go first.
Europe.? Africa? America?
Think of all the nice things you'll get from Santa Clause.
Yes mama.
That's a good boy.
See you in the morning.
If you get bored, you can go down and practice your piano lessons.
See you later my darling.
I knew it. The devil is nearby and these three certainly are up to no good.
Okay, listen now. As soon as Santa
Clause lands on the roof here, all three of us will jump on him.
We'll tie him up and we'll stick him in the sack, and then we'll go home with all of Santa's toys.
But what about Santa?
We can make him our slave, and all his candy and toys will belong to us, so whenever we want something...
Oh boy, this is going to be fun.
You better not talk now.
He can hear us and get away.
Alright children, to bed. Santa Clause will be here any minute now.
Mama, and who is Santa Clause?
He's the man in the store.
The one with the red suit and the white beard, that was laughing very much.
And does Santa know about me?
Uh-huh.
Is he real like my daddy?
He's not. Not really.
The real Santa lives in a castle, and comes once a year.
What does he come for?
They say he *** the children who are obedient.
I don't think he likes me.
He has never brought me any dollies.
It's... not that. Maybe you forgotten to ask him for a dolly.
And if I ask him for one now?
Go ahead. Perhaps he will hear you.
We can say it. Pray it dear.
Mama, please don't cry.
It's definitely Christmas.
And Christmas always makes me feel sad.
It brings bad memories.
Mama, what is Christmas good for?
Well, to remind us that Christ was born many years ago and he was even poorer than we are.
He was born in a bed of straw.
Know what mama? I have already asked
Santa Clause for two pretty dollies.
If he brings the two,
I give one to little Jesus.
Yes my darling.
Maybe we pray with all our might. Hm?
While Santa steers his sleigh towards
Earth, old devil Pitch waits his arrival.
Here comes Santa now.
First stop, Mexico City.
Brrrrr! It's freezing.
I wish I were back in hades, tending the furnace.
He's heard Santa.
By Satan, there he is.
I'm glad that I'm prepared to upset his whole merry Christmas.
We will see who wins out.
This is one night that no one can take from me.
What's he going to do?
Oh, Ho. He's going to push the chimney out of place so that poor old Santa won't be able to enter this house.
Let's hope that Santa realizes what's happened.
What's happened here?
I can smell sulfur.
Well, that must explain this. That old devil Pitch must be around here.
Santa's determined to get in.
He'll find a way.
He's not one to give up.
Well, there's more than one way to beat the devil.
Santa will jump down, using his magic parasol.
Old Pitch hadn't counted on this.
He's almost green with anger.
Uh oh. These two seem to know that Santa is in the living room.
Look out Santa, they'll see you!
Why of course. Santa can handle this.
All he has to do is use the magic dreaming powders prepared by Mister Merlin.
And it isn't long before our two little
"Stay up Lates" are sleeping soundly in their bed.
Now what? Must be Pitch, putting the chimney back in place.
Well, the devil doesn't give up either.
And he seems to be quite happy about his next plot against Santa.
Could Santa be coming down this chimney now?
Uh oh. He's alright, but that was close.
My goodness.
Pitch is foiled again.
But suddenly, he thinks of something else to do.
That's it. He'll huff and puff until his burning breath turns the door knob and key hole red hot. So the that magic key won't work, and Santa will burn his hands.
First he'll see if it's hot enough.
Huh. What do you think of that?
But Santa sees what Pitch is up to, and he isn't afraid.
Meanwhile, Pitch looks out the window to watch Santa burn his hand.
Doesn't seem to know he is right behind him.
Oh ho. A cannon. Now it's Santa's turn to get even with Pitch.
Here in truth, is a poor little rich boy.
He has all the toys a little boy could wish for.
Yet, he is sad and lonely. Lonely for his parents. In spite of all he has, he lacks the most important thing in life.
The company of his mother and father.
I know all those toys don't you happy, but I'll do something for you that I only do for children who are very good.
I will let you see me as I am. And therefore
I will use the powders that will make dream that you are awake.
And now, awaken while you're dreaming.
SantaC lause. You love me, don't you?
Say you love me Santa.
Of course I love you sonny.
Just as much as your parents, because no one loves a child as much as his parents.
Only at times, the parents don't understand their children, and the children don't understand their parents.
And are you really sure that they love me?
When I am left all alone?
Yes. Of course they love you.
And you must believe that love you.
And now, go back to sleep again.
It was all a sweet dream.
When you awaken,
I wish you much happiness.
- How pleasant to see you.
- Hello there.
- George
- Merry Christmas
- Oh, merry Christmas
- Thank you.
- Good bye
- Good Bye
It's been a long time since
I have seen the Martins.
They're both looking pretty well though, aren't they?
That's a strange coctail, isn't it?
It's the coctail of remembrance, which only I can prepare.
Whoever drinks it will think of that, which is most dear, and which at times, for some unknown reason we seem to forget
That's a beautiful thought, perhaps we need a reminder.
Very possibly we forgotten someone we love.
Love can be expressed in many ways, but the truest love is that which we give without expecting anything in return. The greatest reward for those who sincerely, is love itself. So drink my coctail and you will become aware of that love which is closest to your hearts.
And those without love?
They coouldn't drink this cocktail, as it would burn their throats.
Well, since we are very much in love.
May it always be that way.
Now that's strange.
Where did he disappear to?
I don't think he was just a waiter.
He didn't seem to be strange.
That kind look. The white beard.
I knew that face when I was a child.
Couldn't be. If his beard was white when you were a small girl, he'd be dead and buried by now.
Now that's strange. I suddenly have an urge to see our little boy.
Let's go home.
Poor Billy's always alone.
I feel that he is needing us too.
He'll be so glad.
Come on.
Pitch hasn't done too well by himself against Santa.
So he's back to the seek help of these boys who so far are the only ones willing to listen to his evil plan.
They may think it's smart to help him now, but they'll be sorry.
For his advice can only get them into troouble.
One of us better get over there behind the water tank and take the rope along.
When we spot Santa Clause...
...Zowey! We'll pull the rope and knock him down.
Got it!
That's for me.
See. It works.
You got ***?
Oh boy!
Santa Clause is on his way.
Get your head down.
Here comes Santa.
How can you be so dumb?
Stupid fools.
You certainly turned our plan into a horrible mess.
He'll never lick me. I can promise you that.
I'll make him pay dearly for al of this.
Oooh!
That scared me.
The light almost blinded me.
- That music was so loud.
- Scared me too.
What a noise.
Hey, maybe Santa Clause got something in our house.
- Shall we go see?
- Yeah. Let's go.
- Some present for our Christmas.
- Santa Clause doesn't like us.
We didn't get anything.
Why don't you start a fight?
It's all your fault. It was your idea.
Don't be a sissy.
We are complaining.
Well anyway, it was his idea that we should go up by the roof.
My idea? The fault is all yours.
I'm going to bed. I am tired.
Coward. You kicked me when my back was turned.
You be glad it wasn't me.
In that case, it was you.
And you haven't got the nerve to say you didn't.
That's it that's it. Terrific.
Ha ha ha. Haaa. Beat your brains out.
At least I've got the bad thing.
Lucifer will be very pleased.
- I'll beat you.
- Gimme that.
- Ow.
- Ouch. Cut it out.
See you later.
Oh no! Mister Pitch has decided to steal Santas' sleigh.
That's a relief. The reindeer won't obey him.
Tough Luck Pitch.
Uh oh. A pair of scissors.
Look out Santa.
Sulfur.
That old devil Pitch must be around somewhere.
Oh my. Mister merlin's Magic
Dreaming powders.
Now Santa wont be able to put anyone to sleep.
On, my heavenly reindeer.
For there is much to be done.
And there goes the flower to disappear.
And now Santa won't be able to make himself invisible.
What are you going to do now Santa?
Let us hope the flower to disappear doesn't fall into bad hands.
Meanwhile Santa goes on his way, not knowing that his dreaming powders and his flower to disappear are gone.
Santa is not afraid of that dog.
If he goes after him, he still thinks he can disapper.
Go get him Dante.
Sic that old goat. ite him.
Finish him off.
How can old Pitch be so mean?
Siccing a vicious dog on Santa like that?
Powders. The flower to disappear.
No powders and no flower?
What do I do now?
Run Santa. Climb the tree.
It's you only chance.
Get out! Go away! Go!
Shoo! Get out!
That should do it.
That's a very funny sight.
Old white beard and his sack.
Running as if the devil himself were going to take him below.
You'll pay for your mischief.
You just wait and see.
Hmm. But first you'll have to come down from that tree.
And I can have a lot of fun before you can get rid of Dante.
Because you know what I am going to do?
I am going to wake up everybody.
Hah. Nobody can hear your voice.
They hear it in the form of their own private imagination or ideas.
Let them see how foolish you appear.
There's a prowler out there.
He's come to kill your wife and your children.
He is really quite vicious.
He's hiding up in your tree.
Defend yourself.
He's going to murder you.
He's going to murder you.
Mr. Merlin!
Key Man!
Key Man!
Apparently no one is in
Santa's magic obserbatory.
Try to awaken.
There's a man outside.
Marie? Marie, get up.
I think that we're in danger.
- What?
- Yes.
Oh yes.
The assassin that's out in back.
Assassin? I'm not going.
Harry! Get out of bed.
Go after him!.
Show me, where's the pistol?
Where you keep it.
- In the drawer?
- In the drawer.
- In the drawer. In this drawer.
- Why, in this one.
...or, or in this one.
- Here it is. Go after him.
- come on. Don't be funny.
- Me?
- Yes. but I, But I...
With this cough, I can't be expected to go out.
I might catch pneumonia.
Come on. Snap it up. Pneumonia or no pneumonia, you go. you go.
But marie, understand. Why don't you get your father?
- Huh?
- Wait, I must put on my robe.
- Here it is.
-Stop fooling around.
Don't waste time.
Help, Police! Help, Police!
In the tree there's an assassin.
Please come quickly. Help. Police.
A murderer. Run father.
Fire department. Firemen. Firemen.
My house is burning.
I'm on fire. You don't believe me?
Mercy. This is a five alarm fire.
Better let me have that address please, won't you?
Don't expect anything from Santa Clause.
He doesn't bring toys to poor children.
Didn't I tell you to keep that doll?
Silly!
So now you won't have anything.
You are poor.
- Mama, mama.
- What is it dear?
Do the poor people get anything from santa Clause?
Who told you that?
Oh. No my darling. Santa Clause is good to all of the children who are obedient.
It's no matter if you are poor or wealthy.
To bed now my darling.
And sleep well.
Look mama. It's almost day, and Santa Clause hasn't come.
Sleep now darling.
Sleep now, and you will see.
Maybe when you wake up you'll find a dolly.
But go to sleep now, and have pleasant thoughts.
My poor little Lupita.
Who can tell if that Santa Clause will go to our house this year?
Merlin! Merlin!
Merlin! Key man!
Help me!
That did it. The family's awake now.
- Hurry up or  you gotta get a ***...
- Hurry Harry, you go first!
- No. Please ladies first.
- No. There's no time for manners.
- I'm not going to be the first to go.
- Let's all go back to bed.
Hey everyone. I wanna to play cops and robbers.
- Oh My...
- Cops and robbers...
- Alright...
- That's it...
Merlin. Mister Merlin.
Eh. Eh, what's that?
Can you run? Follow me.
Can I run, and follow you?
Better tell me what's the matter.
And I'll decide whether I should run, and whether I should follow you. Eh?
Santa Clause is in danger. He's calling you urgently on the Tele-Talker.
Oh well. In that case, we better hurry.
Let's fly now. One for the money.
Two for the show. Away we go.
Hurry Mister Merlin.
This is no time to play horses.
Santa is in danger.
- We better analyze the situation.
- You're the bravest one here
You can take care of a million men.
Let them all see now, that the only brave one here, is you.
All the men are cowards.
You are a woman.
Put them to shame now.
- Are you sure the "wistol perks"?
- What?
- I mean the pistol works.
- but of course it works.
- Bahhh. If I were only your age...
- Hah, if I were your age, you wouldn't matter if I lived or not.
You both save us both, but neither of you will go out there.
Alright, you heard what she said.
You go first.
No. We bothe go.
We'll both go, and see what happens.
The Red cross, the fired department, the police. What a jam poor Santa's in.
Everyone will see him.
Do you hear those sirens?
They're for you.
The show is about to begin, and you'll never get back before sunrise.
Your reindeer will turn to powder.
You will starve to death.
And I will rule the Earth.
Santa Clause. Santa Clause.
- It's me. Merlin.
- Merlin. Merlin.
Merlin. Where are you?
Here, in the observatory.
Wha.. what is the matter?
In just a few minutes it's going to be day.
Return now.
They got me in a tree Merlin.
I dropped the flower to disappear.
And also the powders for dreaming.
And this beast just won't let me come down.
All this confusion has been prepared by Mister Pitch.
Wait now.
Hurry Mister Merlin! Hurry!
Run!
Where do we find Santa Clause?
He's already been to Asia,
Europe and Australia.
He must be on the American continent.
I think I see him. He's in Mexico.
Doh, golly, but he is in a terrible fix.
And there is no time to go to his rescue.
And the sun is about to rise.
Bad dog. Mad dog.
Against good is bad.
Against black is white.
Against a bad itch, scratch it.
Against thirst, water.
Against mad dog.
Against mad dog. Against mad dog.
A cat. A cat. A cat. A cat.
A cat Sabta Clause.
A cat.
Please be quick Merlin. Now hear this.
My time is almost over.
This time it's serious.
Against mad dog, a cat. Use one of the toy cats that you wind up.
And the dog will go after the cat.
Shoo. Shoo shoo shoo.
Shoo. Shoo.
Let's go now Altogether now, but don't push me. Don't push me.
Just a minute.
You make me nervous.
- Oh come one. Hurry up.
- I can handle this,
- but don't leave me alone, huh.
- Alright, we're with you. Come on.
Where's the body?
How many are injured?
They'll surely find Santa.
Nothing in sight.
Can't see anything.
Better look around.
Don't push me. Leave me alone.
No. Don't do that.
- Oh, huh, oh.
- Why don't you shoot?
- Oh, it's only a hose.
- Be careful it may be a whole gange but don't worry. Try to be brave.
Be calm. We must all be brave.
That's it. The hose.
- Run for the house.
- ...get wet.
Hurry. You barely have time now.
I still have one more friend to visit.
I musn't fail her.
- But...
- No "buts" about it.
First come the children.
I'll see you later, if possible.
What happened? Did you find anyone?
We've looked all over the place, and there's no one to be found.
Let's make sure the fire's out.
There's some smoke, over there.
Well. That serves him right.
The old troublemaker.
He'll probably catch a pneumonia, but he asked for it.
Wait! The flower to disappear has fallen right into Lupita's house.
- Did you find work?
- Nothing my dear. Nothing!
Mama. I saw Santa Clause.
I am very happy I did.
He couldn't stay and talk to me for a very long time, because his white reindeer would turn into powder.
Yes darling, yes. But now go back to sleep, it is very late.
Just go ahead and think of all those wonderful things.
Then, was I just dreaming mama?
Do you think he left ma a dolly, outside in the backyard?
Maybe next Christmas.
Not this one. but he said it was a beautiful dolly.
Look-it mommy. Isn't it a pretty dolly?
Know what mama? That star that's shining out there is a palace of crystal and candy. The home of Santa Clause.
He's just a *** with his sleigh and white reindeer.
Thank you Santa Clause.
Goodbye Santa Clause.
Thank you for a wonderful
Christmas.
And so once again, Santa returns to his palace from his yearly Christmas round.
He us happy, gay, for once again he has brought joy to the children of the world.
Blessed are they who believe, for they shall see God
Peace on Earth, good will toward men.
Merry Christmas.
Once upon a time, long before man learned to fly, long before locomotives left smoky streamers on the horizon, long before all this, somewhere farther than man could sail, there was a little valley.
There on the banks of the winding stream nestled a peaceful little village, and draped around this Hamlet, stretching far and wide over hill and Dale, was the great forest.
Here, deep among old trees, wet moss, and velvet shadows, life flows peacefully along.
Or does it?
Jonathan?
Funny.
Who's playing games?
Look here, young woman!
I might have cut you in half.
No axe can harm me, Jonathan.
Honest Jonathan... that is your name, isn't it?
Honest by name, honest by nature.
Young woman, kindly step aside.
I've business with that tree.
And so have I.
I've come to ask you not to cut it down.
Oh, fancy now, have you?
And may I ask what you have to do with it?
You see, I am queen of this forest.
Oh! And I'm the emperor of China.
Very well, then.
Let me put it in this way.
You see...
This tree is the oldest and fairest of them all.
It's a mighty big oak tree that will keep the whole village warm right through the winter.
But who is going to keep them warm all winter... the little creatures that live in its branches?
See how frightened they are?
Well, look here, it's all very well... spare this tree, Jonathan, and they'll bless you, and so shall I.
Of course, if you put it like that...
Alright.
Oh, thank you, Jonathan.
You shall not go unrewarded.
I'll grant you three wishes.
What?
Anything I wish for?
Three times?
Of course.
Bah! I ought to have more sense.
First, I give away the finest tree, and then I start talking about three wishes.
Fairy tales, all.
Fairy tales!
Where are you?
Where have you gone?
Jonathan.
The wishes belong to both you and your wife.
Don't be hasty.
Yes, your majesty.
Oh, I mean, no, your majesty.
I... I beg your majesty's pardon, I'm sure.
You may stand up now.
Oh, thank you, your majesty.
I'm afraid the tree got a little bit chipped, but don't worry, your majesty.
It will soon heal over.
Real soon.
Sally! Sally!
Barnabee! Sally!
Anna! Anna. Anna.
Do you know what happened today?
Good evening, Jonathan.
Good evening.
You'll never believe what happened to me!
Not now. Dinner's all ready.
Hurry and get cleaned up.
Alright, Anna. But just listen to me for a minute.
You know those oak trees along by the post road with the great big one in the middle?
I was working there today, when suddenly...
I saw a vision.
Yes, I know.
You don't believe me, do you, Anna?
Sit down and say grace.
For what we're about to receive, truly thankful. Amen.
Now then, Anna, let me tell you.
I was chopping away at that big oak tree, the one I was telling you about, when all of a sudden, there was the most wonderful smell of roses.
Cabbage.
Always cabbage.
Can't we ever eat anything else?
We can't afford anything else.
You should thank the good lord for what he provides.
But just for once,
I wish he'd provide a nice, big, juicy sausage.
It's here! Where did it come from?
I told you. It's what I've been trying to tell you all the time.
She granted us three wishes!
She?
Who is she?
Why, the vision, of course.
The beautiful lady.
What beautiful lady?
You never saw anything like it in your life.
One minute, she wasn't there, and the next minute, there she was.
Her skin was like mother-of-pearl, her hair was like the gold of wild honey, and she was so young...
Oh, shame on you, an old man talking like that.
So lovely!
That sausage should grow on your nose for saying such a thing!
The sausage!
See what you've done?
She's granted our second wish!
Now two of our wishes are wasted.
I know what to do.
We'll simply cut it off.
No, you don't!
Alright, then, let it stay.
It doesn't look so bad.
Maybe you don't mind me walking around like this, but I do.
And I wish this thing was off my nose this very instant.
You ought to be ashamed, throwing away our last wish.
What difference does it make to a nose as big as yours?
Mine doesn't smell like garlic all the time.
So...
You're tired of sausage already?
First you're tired of cabbage.
Now you're tired of sausage.
But, Anna, all I said was... you wished for it, didn't you?
Once in a lifetime, poor people like us can ask for anything they want, and what do you wish for?
A sausage!
We had three perfectly good wishes and what have we to show for them? Tell me, what?
Nothing. That is what we have.
When we could have had anything we wanted.
Oh, when I think of it,
I could cry.
Cabbage wasn't good enough for you.
Of all the things we need, you wish for a sausage.
You and your silly wishes!
I sometimes wonder why I ever...
Jonathan... I'm sorry.
Please forgive me.
Ah, it's alright, Anna.
Let's forget it.
You know, Anna, a toy without a child is almost as sad as a child without a toy.
Jonathan, we were so foolish.
Our dream could have come true.
There's still hope, Anna.
She might grant us another wish... just a little one, maybe.
It wouldn't matter to me how little he was.
I'd love him with all my heart, even if he were no bigger than my thumb.
Jonathan! Jonathan!
Hmm?
Someone's outside.
Don't you hear?
What?
Someone's knocking!
I can't hear anything.
Go back to sleep.
Alright!
Who's there?
Is this acorn cottage?
That's right.
The home of Jonathan the woodcutter?
Yes, but I can't see you.
Are you Jonathan?
Yes, I am, but where are you?
Then I'm in the right place.
I can hear you, but I can't see you.
Lower your candle.
Down here.
Glory be!
Come in, lad. Come in!
Oh, thanks. I'm cold.
Ahh, that feels good, father.
Father?
You called me father?
Of course. Don't you recognize your own son?
Oh. I think
I understand.
Tell me, were you sent by the beautiful lady?
That's right.
Welcome, son!
Welcome!
Thanks, I hurried too as fast as I could so I could get here on my birthday.
Jonathan?
Who is it?
Just a minute, Anna.
Who's that?
That's your mother, son.
Come on in.
Surprise her.
We have a visitor, Anna... a little visitor.
He's going to stay with us as long as we live.
Oh, tom!
How did you know my name, mother?
I've always known what your name would be.
Oh, I'm so happy.
Heh, I am, too, but isn't a fella supposed to have a cake on his birthday?
For goodness sake, of course.
You must be starving.
Jonathan, build the fire up.
I'll fix something right away.
Mug for a table, spool for a chair, nice and stable, room to spare.
Thimble for a cup, button for a plate, now we're ready to celebrate.
Happy Birthday, son.
Happy Birthday, son.
Happy Birthday, everyone!
It's getting late.
And I have to fix you something to wear.
Come along. It's time for little boys to be in bed.

Goodnight, mom.
Goodnight, dad.
Which in chinaland mean
"good morning."
Oh, uh, good morning,
Mr., uh...
Allow unworthy one to introduce your humble servant con-fu-shon.
I'm bidding you, on behalf of all toys in nursery, a most glorious welcome.
Oh, thank you.
Good morning, tom.
Good morning, tom!
Good morning.
Good morning, tom.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Good morning.
I didn't know toys could talk.
All very grateful to you, tom, to bring us to life.
Grownup can't do that.
They are too smart.
You see, tom, many, many year, this has been a very lonely place without you, and now that you here, we are so happy.
We want to celebrate.

Ooh!
Hee hee hee!
Ha ha ha!
Everybody run!
Grownup coming!
Run! Run, everybody! Hurry!
Oh, excuse me.
Please. Oh.
He's gone.
Tom! Tom, where are you?
Here I am!
What are you doing out of your cradle?
The sun's hardly up.
Ah, the toys are giving me a party!
The toys gave you a party?
Well, we were having a party. Honest.
We were singing, and dancing, and jumping... shh. Now, listen, son.
Imagination's alright in a little boy, but don't let it go too far.
Never forget your father's name is honest Jonathan.
Turn coming!
Which way, father?
Left today, son.
Watch me take it.
Look! No hands!
Left, Sally!
Another turn coming, father.
Left again?
Yes.
Sally, left again!
Son, this donkey seems to understand every word you say.
Sure.
I understand him, too.
What was that?
A cry from the black swamp.
What's a swamp?
An evil place, son, where horrid birds and animals live.
You must never go inside there.
They'd gobble up a little lad like you in no time.
Great jumping globules of fire!
Can it be real?
It must be.
It lives and breathes.
Antony.
Huh? Huh?
I have an inspiration of unparalleled brilliance.
This little fellow could help us with our job.
What... that little splinter?
He couldn't lift a feather.
Ah, but you forget the old adage...
"there are more ways than one to crack a vault."
He can wiggle through the keyhole.
No, no.
I don't want nobody else.
I can open it with my bare hands.
Of course you can, of course you can, but he can do it quieter.
Watch me strike a bargain with the old man.
We'll play a little game.
The cards, of course, will be marked.
Oh, ho ho ho!
Ivan.
Our fortune is as good as made.
Stand back, my good man.
Oh! Ha ha ha!
Your gracious pardon, sir.
My colleague and I are showmen of prominence on our way to the annual fair, and we were wondering what price you put upon the little lad.
Price? What do you mean?
Do you want to buy him?
Oh, no, no, no.
It would be more of a loan... a sort of loan-lease.
We'd teach him a good trade, and we would pay you.
He will be learning, and you'll be earning.
He's not for sale!
He's my son!
Oh, we understand.
Don't we, Antony?
Oh, yes, we do.
Who would argue with a father's heart?
I like you.
So do I.
I like you very much.
Goodbye, little lad.
One day, your father will be very proud of you.
Arrivederci.
I don't like the looks of those fellows.
I thought they were kind of nice.
Ha ha ha!
Hey, where are you?
Come on.
Hello, Woody.
Queenie!
Where have you been?
I've been calling for you.
I've been looking for you all through the forest.
Oh, poor Woody.
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
I just secured the position as second woodwind in the royal military band.
I think that's wonderful.
Do you really?
Won't you sit down?
Thank you.
Ahh...
You know, queenie, if only there weren't this barrier between us... you being an immortal and I a mere unworthy mortal.
There needn't be a barrier, Woody.
You mean I can be immortal, too?
The other way around.
You can become a mortal.
Well, what's stopping you?
What do you have to do?
It isn't what
I have to do. It's you.
Me?
Uh-huh.
Well, tell me.
Can't you guess?
Well...
I have to be promoted to first woodwind in the royal military band?
No.
Not bandmaster.
It's much simpler than that.
Woody.
Yes?
Would you promise me something?
Anything in the world.
Well...
You won't ever, under any circumstances, ever...
Try to...
Kiss me, will you?
Oh, no!
Certainly not!
Funny how a fella can change, you know.
There was a time when
I wouldn't have thought twice about kissing a girl as pretty as you.
Oh, I was a terrible fella.
Were you, Woody?
I certainly was... kissing, kissing, always kissing girls, sometimes even when they weren't looking.
Ha ha ha!
Ah...
Ahem.
Of course, with you, it's different, you know.
Ever since I first met you,
I've been a changed man.
You know why?
Because you were right up there.
I was way down here.
I still am, but I won't always be.
One day, queenie,
I'll be worthy of you.
And until then...
I'll respect you.
Thank you, Woody.
That's nice.
Hello, Woody.
Good afternoon, Jonathan.
Meet my son tom.
Pleased to meet you, young man.
Goodbye now.
What's the hurry, Woody?
Why don't you come home and have supper with us?
You know Anna's always happy to see you.
Thanks, Jonathan. I wish
I could, but I can't.
I'm a very busy man now.
I have to get back to the village. I have a job.
You? Working?
Certainly.
So long. I'll see you at the fair on Sunday?
Oh, I don't think you will.
Anna and I... we're too old for things like that.
Oh, Jonathan, how can you let this fella miss seeing the fair?
Look, if you can't take him, let him go with me.
I'll show him a good time.
He'll be the guest of the second woodwind in the royal military band.
Ah!
Step up!
Step up!
Step up!
Step up!
¶ Step up, my friends, and see my shoes ¶
¶ I made them especially for you to use ¶
¶ and I can show you the smartest shoes ¶
¶ that you ever saw at a fair ¶
¶ step up, my friends, and see them shine ¶
¶ you never saw shoes that shine like mine ¶
¶ because I handle the talented line ¶
¶ exactly the kind you should wear ¶
¶ these shoes upon my shelf ¶
¶ are shoes I wear myself ¶
¶ these are talented shoes ¶
¶ talented shoes, talented shoes ¶
¶ they leap and jump and hop and skip ¶
¶ and every skip is full of zip ¶
¶ these are talented shoes ¶
¶ talented shoes, talented shoes ¶
I'll take these.
¶ A man is wise to choose ¶
I'll have a pair.
¶ Such talented, talented shoes ¶
I'll take these.
Right, right.
¶ Of 7-league boots ¶
¶ you may have heard ¶
¶ they fly through the air ¶
¶ like a hummingbird ¶
¶ well, I would never say a word ¶
¶ if mine weren't better than those... ¶ give us two of the dancingest pairs.
¶ ...boots set out to fly ¶
¶ they fly much faster ¶
¶ and twice as high ¶
¶ they're just the boots you ought to buy ¶
¶ if you want to be on your toes ¶
¶ these shoes upon my shelf ¶
¶ are shoes I wear myself ¶
¶ these are talented shoes ¶
¶ talented shoes, talented shoes ¶
¶ they leap and jump and hop and step ¶
¶ and every step is full of pep ¶
¶ these are talented shoes ¶
¶ talented shoes, talented shoes ¶
¶ a dunce cannot confuse ¶
¶ such talented, talented, talented ¶
¶ talented, talented, talented shoes ¶ hey, tom, what do you think of those dancing shoes?
Huh?
The dancing shoes.
Oh, I think they're wonderful.
I think so, too.
Let's get some.
But don't you have to stay here?
Oh, we'll be back before it's my turn to play.
They'll never miss me for a few minutes.
Hold on, tom.
Let's go.
I'm sorry, Woody.
All sold out.
Not even a pair for a queen?
Oh, very funny, Woody.
Ha ha ha! Very funny.
Well, how about a pair for this little fellow?
For tom? You know,
I believe I have.
See if these fit.
Ho ho!
Look at this.
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Woody, that no-good loafer... where is he?
Where is he?
Where's Woody?
I was crazy to give him a job in the first place.
Woody!
Woody, wherever you are...
You're fired!
Better go after him, Woody.
Those are talented shoes he's wearing.
They'll keep on dancing as long as the music plays.
Tell them to hold the music!
Stop the music!
Stop!
Bandmaster!
Bandmaster!
What now?
They say to play faster!
Faster? Gladly.
Bandmaster!
Bandmaster!
Stop!
Tom!
Have you seen tom?
No, I haven't.
Stop playing!
Have you seen tom?
No.
My balloon's gone!
Tom!
Hey, Woody!
Look at me!
Don't let go, tom!
Hang on!
It's no good, Ivan.
It won't give at all.
Now...
Finding ourselves in the situation in which you have placed us, it would seem a little coordination is necessary.
We'll use this piece of wood.
This time, our effort shall be unified.
Now, both together when I count 3.
You understand 3?
Yes. It comes after 2.
Good boy. Right.
Ooh...
Argh!
Oh...
Hey, Ivan.
Shh.
Now, we must approach this problem from a highly scientific angle.
Sure, but... but first, we must practice unadulterated silence.
Understand?
Hey! What are you doing?
It's the little runt!
Yes.
Yes, yes.
Thank you.
You saved my life.
Think nothing of it, young fellow.
Fate decreed I should be present in your hour of need, that is all.
Ivan, why can't we use him to get... why don't you shut up?
Oh...
Young fellow, talking about hour of need, it would seem you dropped in just when my companion and I could use your assistance in the performance of a good deed.
Oh, I'll be glad to help.
I knew it.
I knew it the first time
I laid eyes on him, see.
That's what I like about this charming young gentleman.
He's so cooperative.
Uh, what do I have to do?
Come over here.
Get the rope.
Now, Thomas, my boy, listen to me.
Let me explain.
Now, the mayor of this village is an absolute rascal, right?
Now, he has the money belonging to the poor orphans down there.
And he intends to keep it all for himself.
Now, if you'll go down this rope and help us to get the money out, we'll see that it is distributed amongst those to whom it rightfully belongs, eh?
I don't know. Maybe I should ask my father or Woody.
Oh, no! No, there's no necessity to bother them.
I'm sure they would approve.
In fact, I'm quite certain your father would be very proud of you.
Very proud.
Why, yes.
He would?
Yes, of course he would.
Come on. Let's pull the job...
I mean, let us do our best to help the poor little orphans.
Shall we?
You see, Antony?
Everything comes to him who waits.
He believed every word of that silly story. Ha ha!
Hey, wait a minute!
How do I know that money's really for the poor orphans?
Oh, uh...
Well, you have my word of honor.
And you have mine.
Oh! Oh, well, then it must be alright.
Whew.
What should I do now?
Shh.
Tie the rope to one of those bags.
Uh, which one?
The biggest one!
Shh.
Then climb on, and we'll pull you up.
It's going to work,
Tony. Ha ha!
Nobody will guess how we did it.
It's ready.
Right, right.
Ha ha ha!
Ahh! Ha ha ha!
Aren't we going to take any more?
Shh.
Not now. Maybe we'll come back later.
Well, there's plenty more down there.
Ivan.
Let's get rid of the kid now so he won't open his mouth.
Are you out of your mind?
Leave this to me.
Now, listen, my dear fellow.
We're going to take you for a nice little ride.
Ivan.
They are gone.
Come on.
Now, tom, this is where we must part.
Now, that's the road that takes you home.
Now, remember our little secret.
Don't tell anyone.
That's the only way we can surprise the dear little orphans.
Oh, by the way,
I'm sure the dear little orphans would like you to have this.
Run and get it!
Tooty dooty doo!
Tooty tooty too.
Bye!
Bye.
Goodbye.
Bye.
Help! Help!
And where have you been all day?
Oh, all over the place.
I had a wonderful time.
I got some talented shoes, and then I went dancing, and I rode on a balloon.
Oh, I've just been helping two friends do a good deed.
Until it got dark, and you fell into the swamp.
Ah, I'd have got out anyway, but thanks just the same.
What was that?
Hi, queenie.
Hello, Woody.
Do you realize I have searched every inch of this forest trying to find you?
Well, I'm sorry you got lost.
I got lost?
You got lost you mean.
I've been looking for you all day.
The trouble with you, tom... oh, Woody, why don't you leave him alone?
Never mind, queenie.
The trouble with you, tom, is you have no sense of responsibility.
Responsibility?
What about your sense of responsibility?
You were to keep your job and take care of tom.
He only went away to get you a pair of shoes.
You stay out of this!
Don't speak to him like that.
I think you'd better take him straight home.
Oh! "Do this, do that."
I've had enough!
I'm tired of dragging through this forest doing things for other people.
If it's not him flying around in balloons, it's you trying to get me to kiss you.
Woody! How dare you?
Ah, yes, don't think
I don't know.
I'm not as dumb as I may look.
I will kiss you when I'm good and ready to marry you and not before if you think I'd marry a no-good, idle do-nothing like you, you second woodwind, you! Oh!
Hey, wh-wh-what...
Don't go, queenie.
I'm... I'm sorry, Woody.
It was all my fault.
Oh, it's...
It's alright.
Well, come on, tom.
Let's get you home.
That good-for-nothing
Woody.
He'll have some tall explaining to do.
Your father's in a pretty bad mood.
Yes. You better go ahead.
I'll try to get to bed before father sees me.
You've had enough trouble of your own.
Thanks, tom.
So long.
Bye.
Disgraceful!
Disgraceful!
A boy of his age being out till this time of night.
It's been dark for hours.
I should never have let them go.
It's my fault.
Where are they?
Where are they?
I'll teach him a lesson.
I hope nothing's happened to him.
Something will happen to him when he gets home.
The idea of a youngster like that gallivanting around.
I'll see he doesn't do it again,
I can tell you that.
So...
You finally decided to come home.
Now, you tell me what you've been doing all this time, and it better be good.
Jonathan, you mustn't allow yourself to get upset like this.
We'll talk about it in the morning.
Say goodnight to your father.
Goodnight, father.
I'm sorry.
Trouble, yes?
I've just made my folks so unhappy, and I'm so sorry.
Being sorry next best thing to being good.
Humble one suggests you go sleep.
I can't sleep.
I just feel so bad
I can't sleep.
Problem easily remedied.
Let me introduce yawning man... very good friend.
¶ I'm ¶
¶ the yawning man ¶
¶ the yawning man ¶
¶ I come when shadows creep ¶
¶ with my yawning song ¶
¶ I stroll along ¶
¶ and help put people to sleep ¶
¶ If you just can't sleep ¶
¶ and you're tired as could be ¶
¶ there's a remedy ¶
¶ it's the yawning melody ¶
¶ if you yawn, yawn, yawn ¶
¶ then you'll sleep, sleep, sleep ¶
¶ till the dawn, dawn, dawn ¶
¶ so let's all yawn ¶
¶ If the sandman comes ¶
¶ and his sack he unties ¶
¶ tell him, "go away" ¶
¶ who wants sand thrown in his eyes? ¶
¶ if you yawn, yawn, yawn ¶
¶ then you'll sleep, sleep, sleep ¶
¶ till the dawn, dawn, dawn ¶
¶ so let's all yawn ¶ try it, tom.
¶ If you still can't sleep ¶
¶ and for slumber you yearn ¶
¶ if your eyelids burn ¶
¶ and you squirm and twist and turn ¶
¶ try to yawn, yawn, yawn ¶
¶ then you'll sleep, sleep, sleep ¶
¶ till the dawn, dawn, dawn ¶
¶ so let's all yawn ¶
Jonathan, come and sit down.
You can't possibly go to work in weather like this.
You might just as well relax and enjoy your breakfast.
Where's tom?
He's asleep.
Wake him up.
Oh, no, let him sleep.
He's so exhausted.
I wonder who that is.
Well, gentlemen, what can I do for you?
Maybe you can help us.
The treasury has been robbed, and we're searching for the culprits.
Have you seen any strangers hereabouts?
No, I haven't.
Have you, Anna?
Why, no.
Have you looked in the forest?
Yes. We've been all through it.
We're about to have breakfast.
Won't you join us?
Come in, gentlemen.
Make yourselves at home.
Well, thank you.
Won't you sit down?
Here you are.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Very tasty, ma'am.
Well, thank you.
Ouch!
Wake up, con-fu-shon.
Hey, this is a coin from it.
There's no doubt about it, I swear.
How now, madam?
Are you in the habit of baking your bread in the village treasury?
I haven't the least idea how it could've got there.
This coin is part of the stolen money.
Where's the rest of it?
Honestly, I don't know.
I don't even know how this one got here.
Huh! A likely story.
You mean you don't believe her?
Are you accusing us of thievery?
And you call yourself honest Jonathan.
You may call yourself honest Jonathan, but as for me, you're a crook.
That isn't true!
He's the thief.
Don't you dare call my husband a thief!
You're both under arrest.
Hey, wake up, huh?
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up! Help!
Con-fu-shon!
Con-fu-shon, wake up!
Honorable yawning man has very powerful medicine.
We got to open the door!
Con-fu-shon, some soldiers just accused my money of stealing parents.
No, I mean, well, we got to open the door!
He's not a crook.
Are you awake?
A Jack-in-the-box.
Yes, yes, yes!
Come on.
Yes, a big mistake.
You haven't heard the last of this, my friend. Let me go!
Take your hands off me!
Take your hands off me!
Wake up, Jack.
Very quick, wake up.
I'm sleepy.
Go away.
But... but... but honorable tom need honorable
Jack-in-the-box very much.
Why didn't you say so in the first place?
What can I do?
Can you open the door?
Consider it done.
Done.
Little man, big trouble?
Oh, con-fu-shon...
What am I going to do?
To prove innocence, find guilty one.
I know who the robbers are.
With such knowledge, problem easily solved.
Yes. So all I have to do is find the robbers and have them put in jail.
That's what I'm going to do.
¶ are you a dream? ¶
¶ or was it really you? ¶
¶ were we really here? ¶
¶ did my dream come true? ¶
¶ I can't be happy now ¶
¶ till you belong to me ¶
¶ why did you fade away ¶
¶ never my love to be? ¶
¶ was I awake? ¶
¶ I can't believe it's true ¶
¶ but once, long ago ¶
¶ you were the love I knew ¶
¶ can it be possible ¶
¶ you've gone away? ¶
¶ or were you a dream ¶
¶ I dreamed one day? ¶
¶ you touched me ¶
¶ I felt your touch ¶
¶ you must be real ¶
¶ I care so much ¶
¶ come back to me ¶
¶ tell me it's true ¶
¶ tell me ¶
¶ you're not a dream ¶
¶ tell me ¶
¶ it's you ¶ hi!
Oh!
Oh, hello, tom.
I was just, uh, singing to myself a little.
I heard.
Well, where are you going?
Well, I have to go catch a couple of criminals.
Really? And what have they done?
Well, they robbed the treasury.
My folks got blamed for it, and they took them to prison.
Oh, no. Well, that's terrible!
Of course it's terrible!
Are you going to come and help me or just sit there and sing?
Hmm? Oh, help, of course, tom.
Well, come on, then.
I know what they look like, too.
One of them has a big tall hat, and the other's a big fat man.
Wait a minute.
Are they dressed in black?
Yes, yes, and... it's them.
You know who they are, and I know where they are.
Come on, tom.
One for you, and one for me.
Ha ha ha!
Two for you, and two for me.
Ha ha ha!
Three for you, and three for me.

"Give me that money, do you hear?" Ha ha ha!
Go away.

I told him to go away.
Yes.
I heard you.
Now we start again.
Maybe we better leave and share the Booty later.

But you saw me count.
Let's start again.
This time,
I will do the counting.
One for me, and one for you.
Two for me, and two for you.
Three for me, and three for you.

Alright, you do the counting.

Salud, Ivan, eh?
Bottoms up.
Ha ha ha!
Ivan, there's a crook in here, and it's not me.
There are two crooks in here, and they are both you.
Ah... Ha ha!
Ah, money!
There he is.
Oh, money! Ah!
Ha ha! Money. Money.
Oh!
Oh! Argh!
Oh!
Money, I love you!
Ah! En garde!
Touche. Touche.
Touche.
Three-che.
Touche.
Ow!
Ah ha ha!
Had enough?
I've not had enough.
Ow!
Ha ha ha!
Yah! Ha ha!
Aah!
Put 'em up.
Aah!
Aah!
So you try to cheat me, eh?
Now I show you how to count.

And 1, 2, 3, 4 for me. Ha ha!
Ivan, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 for you.
Ha ha ha!
Hey!
There's the kid!
Hey, there he is!
Psst.
Now I'm really going to fix you for coming here.
I'll fix you, boy.
Hear ye! Hear ye!
The decision of the royal court.
"For participation in the robbing
"of the village treasury,
12 lashes of the whip."
"For failure to divulge the names of your confederates, another 12 lashes of the whip."
Whipping's too good for them!
They stole our money!
Get on with the whipping! Please!
We didn't do it.
We're innocent!
Ha ha ha!
Huh? Oh.
Ow!
He bit me.
He bit me.
Where is he?
He's not there, Ivan.
There he is.
Wah!
Help! Help!
Ha ha! Now let's get the money, eh?
Ha ha ha!
Pleasant dreams.
Buena sera.
Well, I guess we got through with the little runt.
Yes, yes.
Come on. Let's go.
No, no, wait.
There's still some more.
Oh, leave those for the orphans.
Ha ha ha!
Come on.
¶ I am an orphan ¶
¶ I am an orphan ¶
¶ I am an orphan ¶ ha ha ha!
¶ I am an orphan ¶ ha ha ha!
Come on.
Tom?
Tom?
Before carrying out the sentence,
I am going to give you one last chance.
Where have you hidden the money?
I can only repeat, sir, we know nothing about it.
Tell the town lasher to prepare.
We've got the money.
We've got the money.
It's the wrong road! This will take us to the village.
The stupid beast won't obey.
Make way for the town lasher!
There's the turn.
Get off the road.
Turn to the right, you stubborn old nag!
To the right, Ivan.
To the right.
I know. I know!
I can't do anything with it.
That was fine.
To the right, Ivan.
To the right.
There's a crossroad coming.
Go straight ahead.
We'll show them who the real robbers are.
Faster! Faster!
I can't go any faster.
We made it! Stop!
There are the robbers!
They stole the money!
Hi, mom. Hi, dad.
Fetch those men!
Out of my way, donkey boy.
What have you done with him?
Where's tom?
I'm over here,
Woody!
Here I am.
No kisses, remember?
Oh, don't worry, mom.
She does that all the time.
Now, wait a minute.
This isn't the way it was supposed to happen.
Try it again...
Gently.
Like... Like this?
Yes.
Queenie, you're real.
