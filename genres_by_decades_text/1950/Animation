Cinderella
You're as lovely as your name
Cinderella
You're a sunset in a frame
Though you're dressed in rags
You wear an air of queenly grace
Anyone can see
A throne would be your proper place
Cinderella
If you give your heart a chance
It will lead you
To the kingdom of romance
There you'll see your dreams unfold
Cinderella
In the sweetest story
Ever told
Once upon a time, in a faraway land, there was a tiny kingdom, peaceful, prosperous, and rich in romance and tradition.
Here, in a stately chateau, there lived a widowed gentleman and his little daughter, Cinderella.
Although he was a kind and devoted father, and gave his beloved child every luxury and comfort, still, he felt she needed a mother's care.
And so, he married again, choosing for his second wife a woman of good family, with two daughters just Cinderella's age, by name, Anastasia and Drizella.
It was upon the untimely death of this good man, however, that the stepmother's true nature was revealed.
Cold, cruel, and bitterly jealous of Cinderella's charm and beauty, she was grimly determined to forward the interests of her own two awkward daughters.
Thus, as time went by, the chateau fell into disrepair.
For the family fortunes were squandered upon the vain and selfish stepsisters, while Cinderella was abused, humiliated, and finally forced to become a servant in her own house.
And yet, through it all,
Cinderella remained ever gentle and kind.
For with each dawn, she found new hope that someday her dreams of happiness would come true.
Well, it serves you right, spoiling people's best dreams.
Yes, I know it's a lovely morning, but it was a lovely dream, too.
What kind of a dream?
Can't tell.
'Cause if you tell a wish, it won't come true.
And, after all...
A dream is a wish
Your heart makes
When you're fast asleep
In dreams you will lose
Your heartaches
Whatever you wish for
You keep
Have faith
In your dreams and someday
Your rainbow will come smiling through
No matter how your heart is grieving
If you keep on believing
The dream that you wish
Will come true
Oh, that clock.
Old killjoy.
I hear you. "Come on, get up," you say.
Time to start another day.
Even he orders me around.
Well, there's one thing.
They can't order me to stop dreaming.
And perhaps someday...
The dreams that I wish
Will come true
No matter how your heart is grieving
If you keep on believing
The dream that you wish
Will come true
- Look what I found.
- Over there, Cinderella.
Wait a minute.
One at a time, please.
Now, Jaq, what's all the fuss about?
New mouse in the house.
Brand-new. Never saw it before.
- Visitor. Visitor!
- Oh, a visitor.
Well, she'll need a dress...
- No, no, no.
- It's not a she, it's a he.
- He, he.
- Oh, that does make a difference.
- He'll need a jacket and shoes...
- Gotta get him out!
- It's in a rat trap.
- Where?
In a trap? Why didn't you say so?
Now, now, calm down, everybody.
Oh, the poor little thing's scared to death.
Jaq, maybe you better explain things to him.
Zuk, zuk, Cinderelly.
Now, now. Look, little guy.
Take it easy. Nothin' to worry about.
We like you. Cinderelly likes you, too.
She's nice, very nice.
That's better. Come on, now. Zuk, zuk.
Zuk, zuk.
Well, that's better.
Well, let's just slip it on for size.
It is a little snug.
But it'll have to do.
Now, for a name.
I've got one. Octavius.
But for short, we'll call you Gus.
Like it, Gus? Like it? Like it?
Gus-Gus.
I've got to hurry.
See he keeps out of trouble, Jaq.
And don't forget to warn him about the cat.
Zuk, zuk. Look, did you ever see a cat?
Cat, cat?
Cat, cat. Lucifer. That's him.
Meany, sneaky.
Jump at you. Bite at you.
Big, big. Big as a house.
Zuk, zuk, Lucify?
Lucify, zuk, zuk.
Here, kitty, kitty.
Come, kitty. Come on.
Lucifer! Come here!
I'm sorry if Your Highness objects to an early breakfast.
It's certainly not my idea to feed you first.
It's orders. Come on.
Lucify. Is that Lucify?
Zuk, Lucify. That's him.
Gus-Gus take the Lucify and look at!
No, Gus-Gus, no.
Now, listen here. Lucify not funny.
Lucify mean.
Bruno.
Bruno!
Dreaming again.
Chasing Lucifer?
Catch him this time? That's bad.
Suppose they heard you upstairs.
You know the orders.
So if you don't want to lose that nice, warm bed, you'd better get rid of those dreams.
Know how?
Just learn to like cats.
No, I mean it.
Lucifer has his good points, too.
For one thing, he...
Well, sometimes he...
There must be something good about him.
Bruno!
Oh, Bruno.
Come on, now. Outside.
I know it isn't easy, but at least we should try to get along together.
And that includes you, Your Majesty.
Breakfast time.
Everybody up. Hurry, hurry.
Come on, everybody, breakfast, breakfast.
Come on, let's eat breakfast.
Breakfast? Breakfast!
Lucify. How're we gonna get out?
Let's see.
Listen, ibby-dibby. Got an idea.
Now, somebody's got to sneak out, get Lucify to chase him, run over to the corner and keep Lucify there.
Then we all run out. Zuk.
Yuk, yuk. Out.
Now we choose the one to do it.
Ibby-dibby hop.
- Hop.
- Hop.
- Ready, hop.
- Hop.
Hop.
- Now...
- Hop, hop, hop.
Hop.
Oh, there you are.
I was wondering.
All right. Breakfast is served.
Take it easy, cluck-cluck.
Let go! Let go, now.
Stop that. Go on, shoo, shoo.
Shoo, shoo, shoo!
Poor little Gus.
Here.
Help yourself.
Where's Gus-Gus?
Well, guess he got away.
Cinderella!
All right, all right. I'm coming.
Oh, my goodness.
Morning, noon, and night.
Cinderella!
Coming, coming.
- Cinderella!
- I'm coming.
- Cinderella!
- In a minute.
Cinderella!
Good morning, Drizella. Sleep well?
As if you care.
Take that ironing and have it back in an hour.
One hour, you hear?
Yes, Drizella.
Good morning, Anastasia.
Well, it's about time.
Don't forget the mending.
Don't be all day getting it done, either.
Yes, Anastasia.
Well, come in, child, come in.
Good morning, Stepmother.
Pick up the laundry and get on with your duties.
Yes, Stepmother.
Oh, Mother. Oh, Mother!
Mother! Mother!
You did it. You did it on purpose.
Mother! Mother! Mother!
Now what did you do?
She put it there.
A big, ugly mouse, under my teacup.
All right, Lucifer.
What did you do with him?
Oh, you're not fooling anybody.
We'll just see about this.
Come on. Let him go.
Now the other one.
Come on!
Oh, poor little Gus.
Oh, Lucifer, won't you ever learn?
Cinderella!
Yes, Stepmother.
Are you gonna get it.
Close the door, Cinderella.
Come here.
- You don't think that I...
- Hold your tongue.
Now, it seems we have time on our hands.
- But I was only trying to...
- Silence!
Time for vicious practical jokes.
Perhaps we can put it to better use.
Now, let me see...
There's the large carpet in the main hall.
Clean it!
And the windows, upstairs and down.
Wash them!
Oh, yes.
And the tapestries and the draperies.
- But I just finished...
- Do them again!
And don't forget the garden.
Scrub the terrace.
Sweep the halls and the stairs.
Clean the chimneys.
And, of course, there's the mending and the sewing and the laundry.
Oh, yes. And one more thing.
See that Lucifer gets his bath.
My son has been avoiding his responsibilities long enough.
It's high time he married and settled down.
Of course, Your Majesty.
But we must be patient.
I am patient!
But I'm not getting any younger, you know.
I want to see my grandchildren before I go.
- I understand, Sire.
- No.
No, you don't know what it means to see your only child grow farther, farther, and farther away from you.
I'm...
I'm lonely in this desolate old palace.
I... I want to hear the pitter-patter of little feet again.
Now, now, Your Majesty.
- Perhaps if we just let him alone...
- Let him alone?
With his silly romantic ideas?
But, Sire, in matters of love...
Love.
Just a boy meeting a girl under the right conditions.
So, we're arranging the conditions.
But, Your Majesty, if the Prince should suspect.
Suspect!
Look, the boy's coming home today, isn't he?
Yes, Sire.
Well, what could be more natural than a ball to celebrate his return?
Nothing, Sire.
If all the eligible maidens in my kingdom just happened to be there, why, he's bound to show interest in one of them, isn't he?
Isn't he?
Yes, Sire.
The moment he does...
Soft lights.
Romantic music.
All the trimmings!
It can't possibly fail.
Can it?
Yes, Sire. No, Sire!
Very well, Sire.
I shall arrange the ball for...
- Tonight.
- Tonight? Tonight!
- Oh, but, Sire...
- Tonight!
And see that every eligible maid is there.
Understand?
Yes, Your Majesty.
The pear-shaped toad
Sing, sweet nightingale
High
Above me
Oh, sing, sweet nightingale
Sing, sweet nightingale
High
Above
Oh, sing, sweet nightingale
Sing, sweet nightingale
High
Oh, sing, sweet nightingale
Sing, sweet
Nightingale
Oh, sing, sweet nightingale
Sing, sweet
Oh, sing, sweet nightingale
Sing
Oh, sing, sweet nightingale
Oh, sing, sweet
Oh
Sing
Lucifer!
You mean old thing.
I'm just going to have to teach you a lesson.
Open in the name of the King.
An urgent message from His Imperial Majesty.
- Thank you.
- From the King!
What's it say, Cinderelly?
What's it say?
I don't know.
He said it's urgent.
Maybe I should interrupt the music lesson.
Sing, sweet nightingale
High
You clumsy! You did it on purpose.
- It's her fault.
- Girls, girls. Remember, above all, self-control.
Yes!
Cinderella!
I've warned you never to interrupt...
- This just arrived from the palace.
- From the palace!
- Give it here.
- Let me have it.
I'll read it.
Well, there's to be a ball.
- A ball!
- In honour of His Highness, the Prince.
Oh, the Prince!
And, by royal command, every eligible maiden is to attend.
- Why, that's us!
- And I'm so eligible.
That means I can go, too.
Her, dancing with the Prince.
I'd be honoured, Your Highness.
Would you mind holding my broom?
Well, why not?
After all, I'm still a member of the family.
And it says, "By royal command",
"every eligible maiden is to attend."
Yes, so it does.
Well, I see no reason why you can't go.
If you get all your work done.
Oh, I will. I promise.
And if you can find something suitable to wear.
I'm sure I can.
Oh, thank you, Stepmother.
Mother, do you realise what you just said?
Of course.
I said "if."
Oh. "If."
Isn't it lovely?
- It was my mother's.
- It's pretty, but it looks old.
Well, maybe it is old-fashioned, but I'll fix that.
- How do you do it?
- Wait a minute.
There ought to be some good ideas in here.
This one.
Oh, very nice. Nice.
- Like it.
- It'll be easy.
I'll have to shorten the sleeves,
I'll need a sash,
- a ruffle, something for a collar...
- Cinderella!
Oh, now what do they want?
Cinderella!
Oh, well.
I guess my dress will just have to wait.
Cinderella!
All right, all right. I'm coming.
Poor Cinderelly.
Every time she finds a minute, that's the time when they begin it.
Cinderelly, Cinderelly.
Cinderella!
Cinderelly, Cinderelly
Night and day it's Cinderelly
Make the fire
Fix the breakfast
Wash the dishes
Do the moppin'
And the sweepin' and the dustin'
They always keep her hoppin'
She'd go around in circles
Till she's very, very dizzy
- Still they holler
- Keep her busy, Cinderelly
Yeah. Keep her busy.
You know what?
- Cinderelly won't go to the ball.
- What?
- Not go?
- What did you say?
You'll see. They'll fix her.
Work, work, work.
She'll never get her dress done.
Poor Cinderelly.
Hey! We can do it!
We can do it
We can do it
We can help our Cinderelly
We can make the dress so pretty
There's nothing to it, really
We'll tie a sash around it
Put a ribbon through it
When dancing at the ball she'll be more beautiful than all
In the lovely dress we make for Cinderelly
Hurry, hurry, hurry
Gonna help our Cinderelly
Got no time to dilly-dally
We got to get it goin'
I'll cut it with the scissors.
And I can do the sewing.
Leave the sewing to the women.
You go get some trimmin'.
And we'll make a lovely dress for Cinderelly, whoo
We'll make a lovely dress for Cinderelly
Follow me, Gus-Gus.
I know where to go.
It's gonna be pretty, this dress.
Cinderelly will be surprised.
Surprised, surprised. Very surprised.
And this, too, my slippers.
Don't forget...
- Take my dress.
- Here, mend the buttonholes.
- Press my skirt and mind the ruffle.
- Cinderella?
- Yes?
- When you're through, and before you begin your regular chores,
I have a few little things.
Very well.
I don't see why everyone else has nice things to wear, and I always end up in these old rags.
This sash! I wouldn't be seen dead in it.
You should talk. These beads!
I am sick of looking at them.
- Trash.
- Oh, I hate this.
Come on and be careful.
Yes, yes, yes. Real careful.
We can use that, Gus-Gus.
Pretty, pretty.
Look out. Lucify!
Beads!
Very pretty beads!
A dream is a wish your heart makes
When you're fast asleep
In dreams you will lose your heartaches
Whatever you wish for
You keep
No matter how your heart is grieving
If you keep on believing
The dream that you wish will come true
Okay. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
Whatever you wish for you keep
All right.
Heave, ho. Heave, ho.
Heave, ho.
The dream that you wish will come true
Will come true
- Yes?
- The carriage is here.
Why, Cinderella,
- you're not ready, child.
- I'm not going.
Not going? Oh, what a shame.
But, of course, there will be other times.
Yes. Good night.
Oh, well.
What's a royal ball?
After all, I suppose it would be frightfully dull, and boring, and completely...
Completely wonderful.
- It's my...
- Surprise!
- Surprise!
- Surprise!
- Happy birthday!
- No, no, no, no!
Well, I never dreamed it.
It's such a surprise.
Oh, how can I ever...
Oh, thank you so much.
Remember, when you're presented to His Highness,
- be sure...
- Wait!
Please, wait for me.
Isn't it lovely? Do you like it?
Do you think it will do?
- Cinderella!
- Mother, she can't.
- Oh, no.
- You can't!
Girls, please.
After all, we did make a bargain.
Didn't we, Cinderella?
And I never go back on my word.
How very clever.
These beads, they give it just the right touch.
Don't you think so, Drizella?
No, I don't. I think she's...
Why, you little thief!
They're my beads. Give them here.
Oh, no.
And look, that's my sash.
She's wearing my sash.
- Mine!
- Oh, please.
Please, no.
Thief!
Girls, girls.
That's quite enough.
Hurry along now, both of you.
I won't have you upsetting yourselves.
Good night.
You will lose your heartache
Whatever you wish for
You'll keep
Oh, no. No, it isn't true.
Have faith in your dreams and someday
It's just no use.
Your rainbow will come smiling through
No use at all.
No matter how your heart is grieving
If you keep on believing
I can't believe. Not any more.
The dream that you wish
Will come true
There's nothing left to believe in.
Nothing.
Nothing, my dear?
- Oh, now you don't really mean that.
- Oh, but I do.
Nonsense, child!
If you'd lost all your faith,
I couldn't be here.
And here I am.
Oh, come now. Dry those tears.
You can't go to the ball looking like that.
The ball?
- Oh, but I'm not...
- Of course, you are.
But we have to hurry, because even miracles take a little time.
- Miracles?
- Watch.
What in the world did I do with that magic wand? I was sure...
Magic wand?
That's strange.
- I always...
- Then you must be...
Your fairy godmother? Of course.
Where is that wand? I...
Oh! I forgot.
I put it away.
Look at what she did.
How'd she do it?
Now, let's see.
I'd say the first thing you need is
- a pumpkin.
- A pumpkin?
Now the magic words.
Sala-gadoola-menchika-boo-la
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo
Put 'em together and what have you got?
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo
Sala-gadoola-menchika-boo-la
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo
It'll do magic
Believe it or not
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo
Now sala-gadoola means
Menchika-boolaroo
But the thing-a-ma-bob that does the job
Is bibbidi-bobbidi-boo
Sala-gadoola-menchika-boo-la
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo
Put 'em together and what have you got?
Bibbidi-bobbidi
Bibbidi-bobbidi Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo
Oh, looky.
Isn't it wonderful?
Oh, it's beautiful.
Yes, isn't it?
With an elegant coach like that, of course, we'll simply have to have
- mice!
- Mice?
Oh, this really is nice.
Why, we'll have a coach and four when we're through.
Just a wave of my stick and to finish the trick, bibbidi, bobbidi, boo.
Gracious, what did I do?
I was sure there were four.
There should be one more.
There you are.
Bibbidi, bobbidi, boo.
Oh, poor Lucifer.
Serves him right, I'd say. Now...
Where were we? Oh, goodness, yes.
You can't go to the ball without a horse.
Another one?
But tonight, for a change, you will handle the reins, and sit in the driver's seat, too.
For instead of a horse, you're the coachman, of course.
Bibbidi, bobbidi, boo.
That does it, I guess, except for...
Oh, yes!
The finishing touch. And, that's you.
Yes, Bruno, that's right, you'll be footman tonight.
Bibbidi, bobbidi, boo.
Well, well, hop in, my dear.
We can't waste time.
- But...
- No, don't try to thank me.
Oh, I wasn't... I mean, I do, but...
But, don't you think my dress...
Yes, it's lovely, dear.
Good heavens, child.
You can't go in that!
Now, let's see, dear.
Your size and the shade of your eyes.
Something simple, but daring, too.
Oh, just leave it to me.
What a gown this will be.
Bibbidi-bobbidi.
Bibbidi-bobbidi.
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.
Oh, it's a beautiful dress.
Did you ever see such a beautiful dress?
And, look, glass slippers.
Why, it's like a dream.
A wonderful dream come true.
Yes, my child.
But, like all dreams, well, I'm afraid this can't last forever.
You'll have only till midnight, and then...
Midnight? Thank you.
Now, now, now, just a minute.
You must understand, my dear, on the stroke of 12:00 the spell will be broken, and everything will be as it was before.
Oh, I understand, but it's more than I ever hoped for.
Bless you, my child.
I... Goodness me!
It's getting late.
Hurry up, dear. The ball can't wait.
Have a good time.
Dance, be gay.
Now, off you go.
You're on your way.
With a bibbidi-bobbidi
Bibbidi-bobbidi
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo
Princess Frederica
Eugenie de la Fontain.
Mademoiselle Augustina DuBois.
Daughter of General Pierre DuBois.
The boy isn't cooperating.
Mademoiselle Leonora
Mercedes de la Tour.
Daughter of Colonel and Madame de la Tour.
I can't understand it.
There must be at least one who'd make a suitable mother.
Sire.
A suitable wife.
Mademoiselles
Drizella and Anastasia Tremaine.
Daughters of Lady Tremaine.
I give up.
Even I couldn't expect the boy to...
Well, if I may say so,
Your Majesty, I did try to warn you, but you, Sire, are incurably romantic.
No doubt you saw the whole pretty picture in detail.
The young Prince bowing to the assembly.
Suddenly he stops. He looks up.
For, lo, there she stands.
The girl of his dreams.
Who she is or whence she came, he knows not, nor does he care, for his heart tells him that here, here is the maid predestined to be his bride.
A pretty plot for fairy tales, Sire.
But in real life, oh, no.
No! It was foredoomed to failure.
Failure, eh?
Take a look at that, you pompous windbag.
Who is she?
- You know her?
- No, Sire.
I've never seen her before.
That's one thing in her favour.
The waltz. Quick, the waltz!
Lights. The lights.
Failure, eh?
Well... Now for a good night's sleep.
Oh, quite so, Sire. I believe I, too...
You will stay right here.
See they're not disturbed, and when the boy proposes, notify me immediately.
Notify me immediately.
And remember, if anything goes wrong...
- Who is she, Mother?
- Do we know her?
Well, the Prince certainly seems to.
I know I've never seen her.
Nor I.
But she certainly is... Wait.
There is something familiar about her.
Ahem.
So this is love
So this is what makes life
Divine
I'm all aglow
- And now I know
- And now I know
The key to all Heaven
Is mine
My heart has wings
And I can fly
I'll touch every star
In the sky
So this is the miracle
That I've been dreaming of
So this
Is
Love
Oh. Oh, my goodness.
What's the matter?
It's midnight.
Yes, so it is. But why...
- Goodbye.
- No, no, wait.
- You can't go now. It's only...
- Oh, I must. Please.
- Please, I must.
- But why?
Well, I... Oh, the Prince,
I haven't met the Prince.
The Prince?
But didn't you know...
- Goodbye.
- No, wait.
Come back. Please come back.
I don't even know your name.
How will I find you?
Wait! Please wait.
Goodbye.
Oh, I say. Young lady.
- Wait!
- The Prince!
Just a moment.
Guard! Guard!
Stop that coach! Close those gates!
Follow that coach!
Open those gates!
I'm sorry.
I guess I forgot about everything.
Even the time, but...
But it was so wonderful.
And he was so handsome, and when we danced...
Oh, I'm sure even the Prince himself couldn't have been more...
More...
- Oh, well, it's over and...
- Cinderelly.
Look, look! The slippers!
Yeah, your slipper.
Your slipper, Cinderelly.
Thank you.
Thank you so much, for everything.
Your Majesty,
I see no point in beating about the bush.
I regret to inform you, Sire, that the young lady has disappeared, leaving behind only this glass slipper.
Yes. I'll do it.
No. I just can't.
Well, come in.
Come in!
- Your Majesty...
- So, he's proposed already?
- Tell me about it.
- Well...
- Who is she?
- I didn't get a chance...
No matter. We've more important things to discuss.
Arrangements for the wedding, invitations, a national holiday.
- All that sort of thing.
- But, Sire...
Here. Have a cigar. Take a few more.
But...
Better practise passing these out, eh?
But, if you'd only listen.
And for you, my friend.
- Your Majesty, please...
- A knighthood.
I hereby dub you Sir...
By the way, what title would you like?
- Sire? She got away.
- Sir "She Got Away"?
A peculiar title, but if that's what you...
She what? Why, you...
You... You traitor!
Now, Sire.
Remember, your blood pressure.
Treason!
No, Sire. No!
Sabotage!
You were in league with the Prince.
I tried to stop her, but she vanished into thin air.
A likely story.
But it's true, Sire.
All we could find was this glass slipper.
The whole thing was a plot!
But, Sire, he loves her.
He won't rest till he finds her.
He's determined to marry her.
What? What did you say?
The Prince, Sire, swears he'll marry none but the girl who fits this slipper.
He said that, did he?
We've got him!
But, Sire, this slipper may fit one of any number of girls.
That's his problem. He's given his word.
- We'll hold him to it.
- No, Your Highness.
I'll have nothing to do with it.
You'll try this on every maid in my kingdom.
And if the shoe fits, bring her in.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Cinderella? Cinderella?
- Cinderella! Where is that...
- Yes?
Here I am.
My daughters, where are they?
I think they're still in bed.
Don't just stand there!
Bring up the breakfast trays at once.
And hurry!
I wonder what's the matter.
What's the matter with her?
I don't know. Let's find out. Come on.
Drizella. Drizella!
What?
Get up. Quick. This instant.
We haven't a moment to lose.
Anastasia.
Get up, Anastasia.
What for? Why?
Everyone's talking about it, the whole kingdom.
- Hurry now. He'll be here any minute.
- Who will?
The Grand Duke.
He's been hunting all night.
- Hunting?
- For that girl.
The one who lost her slipper at the ball last night.
They say he's madly in love with her.
- The Duke is?
- No, no, no. The Prince!
The Prince!
You clumsy little fool.
Clean that up, then help my daughters dress.
What for?
If he's in love with that girl, why should we even bother?
Now, you two, listen to me.
There is still a chance that one of you can get it.
One of us?
Why, Mother, what do you mean?
Just this:
No one, not even the Prince, knows who that girl is.
We know! We know! Cinderelly!
The glass slipper is their only clue.
The Duke has been ordered to try it on every girl in the kingdom.
And if one can be found whom the slipper fits, then, by the King's command, that girl shall be the Prince's bride.
- His bride.
- His bride!
Cinderella, get my things together.
Never mind her. Get mine right away.
What's the matter with her?
- Wake up, stupid.
- We've gotta get dressed.
Dressed. Oh, yes.
Oh, we must get dressed.
It wouldn't do for the Duke to see me...
Mother, did you see what she did?
- Are you just going to let her...
- Quiet!
So this is love
What's she gonna do?
I don't know. Gotta watch.
Come on.
- Cinderelly!
- Cinderelly!
So this is the miracle
That I've been dreaming of
What?
Oh, no!
No, please!
Oh, you can't, you just can't.
Let me out! You must let me out!
You can't keep me in here!
Oh, please.
No, no. She can't do it.
She can't lock up Cinderelly.
I'm gonna...
Please. Please.
We gotta get that key, Gus-Gus.
We just gotta get that key.
He's over here, the Duke-Duke.
- Yeah, yeah. Who?
- The Grand Duke, with the slipper.
We gotta get that key quick.
Yup, yup. Key, key. Quick.
Oh, Mother, Mother, he's here, he's here.
- The Grand Duke.
- Do I look all right?
- I'm so excited, I don't know what I'll do.
- Girls.
Now, remember, this is your last chance. Don't fail me.
Announcing
His Imperial Grace, the Grand Duke.
You honour our humble home.
Quite so.
May I present my daughters,
Drizella, Anastasia.
Your Grace.
Yes. Charmed, I'm sure.
His Grace will read the royal proclamation.
"All loyal subjects of His Imperial Majesty"
"are hereby notified by royal proclamation in regard to a certain"
"glass slipper."
"It is decreed..."
Why, that's my slipper!
Well, I like that. It's my slipper!
No, no, no! It's Cinderelly's slipper!
- How can she stand there...
- Girls.
Your manners.
A thousand pardons, Your Grace.
Please continue.
Yes, quite so.
Oh, yes.
"It is upon this day decreed"
"that a quest be instituted throughout..."
"The sole and express purpose of such quest to be as follows:"
"That every maid throughout the kingdom without exception,"
"shall try on her foot this slipper of glass,"
"and should one be found upon whose foot this slipper shall properly fit,"
"such maiden shall be acclaimed the object of this search"
"and shall be looked upon as the true love of His Royal Highness,"
"our beloved son and heir, the noble Prince."
"Said Prince will, upon bended knee"
"beg, request, or if need be, implore"
"said maiden that he be granted her hand in marriage."
"Whereupon, should the aforementioned maiden"
"look with favour, shall the couple pledge their troth..."
"And in due course, upon the inevitable demise of His Majesty the King,"
"succeed to the throne to rule over the land"
"as King and Queen of our kingdom."
"So be it."
You must be quite fatigued, Your Grace.
May we offer you some tea?
What? Tea?
Thank you, madam, no.
We must proceed with the fitting.
Of course. Anastasia, dear.
There. I knew it was my slipper.
Exactly my size.
I always wear the same size.
As soon as I saw it, I said...
Oh, well...
It may be a trifle snug today.
You know how it is, dancing all night.
I can't understand why.
It's always fit perfectly before.
I don't think you're half trying.
Mother, can you...
Quiet, my dear.
We mustn't disturb His Grace.
Young man, are you sure you're trying it on the right foot?
Oh, it's the right foot, but...
These glass shoes aren't always reliable.
Come on, hurry.
Up the stairs, up the stairs!
Lucify, Lucify.
Up, up, up with it.
Here.
Why can't you hold still a minute?
My word. Enough of this!
The next young lady, please.
Did you hear that, Gus?
- Yup.
- Gotta hurry.
Come on, come on, hurry.
Gus-Gus, Gus-Gus, come on.
Look, look. Just up there. Come on.
Us is coming, Cinderelly.
- I can get you out.
- You've got the key!
How did you ever manage to...
Lucifer!
Let him go, Lucifer.
Please, let him go.
- Let him go.
- Let him go!
Let him go. Let him out, you hear?
Lucify, you...
Bruno. Yes, Bruno!
Quick, get Bruno. Get Bruno!
Of all the stupid little idiots.
I'll do it myself.
Get away from me.
I'll make it fit.
- There.
- It fits.
It fits?
No!
Oh, Your Grace, I'm dreadfully sorry.
It shan't happen again.
Precisely, madam.
Come on, come on.
Get up, Gus-Gus, get up.
Don't, don't, don't, don't.
Let go, let go.
You are the only ladies in the household I hope... I presume.
- There's no one else, Your Grace.
- Quite so.
- Good day. Good day.
- Your Grace?
Your Grace, please, wait.
May I try it on?
- Pay no attention.
- It's Cinderella.
- From the kitchen.
- Ridiculous.
She's out of her mind.
Just an imaginative child.
Madam, my orders were "every maiden."
Come, my child.
Oh, no.
No, no, no. Oh, no!
Oh, this is terrible.
The King, what will he say?
What will he do?
Perhaps, if it would help...
No, no. Nothing can help now. Nothing.
But, you see, I have the other slipper.
Have faith in dreams
And someday
Your rainbow will come smiling through
No matter how your heart is grieving
If you keep on believing
The dream that you wish
Will come true

Stand back, musketeers.
They shall sample my blade. Touché!
Musketeers? En garde? My blade?
Whoever's in charge here?
The scenery! Where's the scenery?
Stand back, musketeers.
They shall sample my... blade?
Okay, have it your way.
Would it be too much to ask if we could make up our minds?
Buster, it may come as a complete surprise to you... to find that this is an animated cartoon.
And that in animated cartoons they have scenery.
And in all the years I've...
All right, wise guy, where am I?
And I've never been so humiliated in all my life!
Look, Mac, just what's going on around here? Let's get organized.
How about some scenery?
That's dandy. That's rich, I'll say.
Now how about some color, stupid.
Not me, you slop artist!
Where's the rest of me?
It isn't as though I haven't lived up to my contract, goodness knows.
And goodness knows it isn't like I haven't kept myself trim.
Goodness knows, I've done that.
That's strange. All of a sudden,
I don't quite feel like myself.
I feel all right. And yet, I...
You know better than that!
Sea picture?
I always wanted to do a sea epic.
Now, Mr. Rembrandt, if you'll kindly oblige with a little appropriate scenery.
Again?
Come here! Give me a close-up.
This is a close-up?
A close-up, you jerk!
Thanks for the sour persimmons, cousin.
Now look, buster, let's have an understanding.
Now what?
Brother, what a way to run a railroad.
As I was saying...
All right, let's get this picture started.
No!
Listen, pal, let's discuss this thing sanely.
Look, I tell you what.
You go your way and I'll go mine.
Live and let live, right? Right.
Ladies and gentlemen, there will be no further delays... so I shall attempt to entertain you in my own inimitable fashion.
- Now what?
- What are you doing down there?
Down here? What are you doing up there?
Down here.
Listen, bud, if you wasn't me,
I'd smack you right in the puss.
- Don't let that bother you, Jack.
- Okay, buddy, you asked for it.
Oh, brother, I'm a buzz-boy.
Time to hit the old silk. Geronimo!
"Under a spreading chestnut tree
The village smithy stands
"The smith, a mighty man is he
With strong and sinewy
"hands"
All right, enough is enough.
This is the final, the very, very last straw!
Who is responsible for this?
I demand that you show yourself!
Who are you?
Ain't I a stinker?
English
This is the night
It's a beautiful night
And they call it bella notte
Look at the skies
They have stars in their eyes
On this lovely bella notte
So take the love
Of your loved one
You'll need it about this time
To keep from falling like a star
When you make that dizzy climb
For this is the night
And the heavens are right
On this lovely
Bella notte
On this lovely
Bella notte
Silent as a snowflake in the night
Holy is the spirit of this night
All the world is calm and peaceful
All the world is bright and joyful
Spirit of love
And child of peace
Love unending
That shall not cease
Peace, my children
Of good will
Peace, my children
Peace be still
[man] It's for you, darling.
Merry Christmas.
Oh, Jim, dear.
It's the one I was admiring, isn't it?
- Trimmed with ribbons?
- [whimpering]
[Jim] Well, it has a ribbon.
[gasping]
Oh, how sweet.
- [Jim] You like her, darling?
- Oh, I love her.
What a perfectly beautiful little lady.
Come on, Lady. Over here.
That's a girl.
There, now. A nice little bed for you.
[Darling] But Jim, dear, are you sure she'll be warm enough?
[Jim] Why, of course, darling.
She'll be snug as a bug in a...
Uh-oh!
Almost forgot something.
There.
[Jim] Good night, Lady.
Now, now, don't worry, darling.
She'll go right to sleep.
No, no, Lady.
This is where you belong, right here.
- [whimpering]
- [Darling] Oh, look.
She's lonesome.
Don't you think maybe?
Just for tonight?
[Jim] Darling, if we're going to show her who's master, we must be firm from the very beginning.
[whimpering]
[Jim pounding on ceiling] Lady!
Stop that now!
Stop it!
[whimpering]
[footsteps]
[whimpering]
[Jim pounding on door] Lady!
[Jim] Quiet, now. You hear me?
Back to bed!
Quick, now.
Not one more sound.
[chiming]
[scraping]
[snoring]
- [whimpering]
- [Darling] Jim, dear.
[groaning]
[whimpering]
Aw, Jim.
[Jim] Hmm? What?
[whimpering, howling]
[Jim yawning]
[Jim] Oh, all right.
But remember, just for tonight.
[rooster crowing]
[chiming]
[Darling groaning]
[yawns] All right, Lady. All right.
I'm up. I'm up, Lady.
Oh, no!
[Darling] What's wrong, Jim? What is it?
Can't you explain to Lady about Sundays?
[barking]
[growling, barking]
[bicycle bell rings]
[Jim] Have you noticed, darling, since we've had Lady we see less and less of those disturbing headlines?
[Darling] Yes, I just don't know how we ever got along without her.
[Jim] Say, she must be about six months old.
We'd better be getting her a license.
Hope it fits.
My, but it does look nice.
So grown up.
Won't Jock and Trusty be surprised?
[humming]
Four steps straight
and then to the left
And right to the place
where I marked it
With a bonnie, bonnie bone
that I buried for me own
In my bonnie, bonnie bank
in the backyard
A-ha, that's a grand sight.
[Lady] Jock!
Oh, Jock!
Hello, Jock.
Oh! Oh, it's you, lassie. [chuckles]
Notice anything different?
Eh, uh... You've had a bath?
No, not that.
You've had your nails clipped?
[Lady] Mm-mmm. Guess again.
Well, I wouldn't a-be knowin'.
Why-o, lassie.
A bonnie new collar.
- Do you like it?
- Aye. [sniffs]
Mmm. It must be very expensive.
- Have you shown it to Trusty yet?
- No.
Ah, we'd best go at once.
You know how sensitive he is about these things.
[snoring]
[whimpering]
[snorting, howling]
He's dreaming.
[Jock] Aye.
Dreamin' of those bonnie bygone days when he and his grandfather were trackin' criminals through the swamps.
- [Lady] They were?
- That was before...
Before what?
'Tis time you knew the truth, lassie.
[Jock] It shouldn't have happened to a dog.
But, well...
Trusty has lost his sense of smell.
- [Lady gasps] No!
- [Jock] Aye.
But we must never let on that we know, lassie.
It would break his poor heart.
Uh... Which way did he go?
Which way did he go?
- Go?
- [Trusty] Yeah, big fella.
About, uh, six-foot-two.
[sniffs] No, uh, three.
Wore a striped suit. No collar.
Why, Miss Lady.
You have a collar.
Mm-hmm. And a license.
My, my.
- How time does fly.
- Aye.
It seems only yesterday she was cuttin' her teeth on Jim Dear's slippers, and now there she is, a full-grown lady.
Wearin' the greatest honour man can bestow.
The badge of faith and respectability.
That's right, Miss Lady.
As my grandpappy,
Old Reliable, used to say...
I don't recollect if I've ever mentioned Old Reliable before.
Aye, you have, laddie.
Oh, yeah.
- [whistling]
- Ooh, it's Jim Dear.
Please excuse me.
Hello, there, Lady.
Come on, beat you home.
Oh, you win again.
Steady, now.
Steady.
Well, what have we here?
Oh, big girl now, huh?
All right.
Oh, ladies first.
You know, darling, with Lady here
I'd say life is quite complete.
[Darling] Yes, dear.
I don't imagine anything could ever take her place in our hearts.
[steam hissing]
[train whistle blows]
[train chugging]
[stretching]
[shuddering]
Ah! What a day!
Well, now to dig up some breakfast.
Hmm? [chuckles]
Aw, cute little rascals.
Cootchie-cootchie-coo.
Now. That breakfast, let's see.
Bernie's?
Mmm... no.
Francois...
No, no.
Nope. Too much starch. Ah!
Tony's. Oh, that's it.
I haven't been there in a week.
[Tony] A beautiful day
to make pizza
Hey, still we call it bella notte
[scratching]
Well, buon giorno, Butch.
You want-a your breakfast, eh?
OK. The boss, he's a-saving some a-nice bones for you.
Breakfast comin' up from a-left field.
[chuckles] Good catch!
[man whistling]
[man] Whoa, boy, whoa.
[whistling continues]
[man humming]
Hey. Psst. Psst.
Blimey.
- Look, Peg, it's the Tramp.
- [Tramp] Shh.
Hiya, handsome.
Come to join the party?
All right. No time for wisecracks.
I've got to get you out.
I'm telling you, the pressure's on.
Signs all over town.
- Gee, thanks.
- You're a bit of all right, chum.
- OK, OK, get going.
- [man] Hey! What's going on there?
Scram. And be careful.
- [snarling]
- Why, you mangy mutt.
Hey. Let go. Let go of me.
Well. Snob hill. Ha!
Hi, gals. How's pickings?
Pretty slim, eh?
Yeah. I'll bet they've got a lid on every trash can.
Uh-oh. And a fence around every tree.
[chuckles] I wonder what the leash and collar set does for excitement.
Lassie. Lassie!
Oh, Miss Lady, ma'am.
Miss Lady!
[Jock] Ah! Good morning, lassie.
'Tis a bonnie, braw, bright day. Uh...
...day.
Why, Miss Lady.
Is something wrong?
Aye. Tell us, lassie.
- If somebody's been mistreatin' ya...
- Oh, no, Jock.
It's something I've done, I guess.
You?
It must be.
- Jim Dear and Darling are acting so...
- [Darling humming]
[humming continues]
- Jim Dear and Darling?
- Hush, lad.
Now, lassie, get on with the details.
Well, I first noticed it the other day when Jim Dear came home.
[clock chiming]
[barking]
Down, Lady, down!
Darling, darling!
Are you all right?
[Darling] Of course I am.
Why shouldn't I be?
[Jim] I just can't help worrying.
After all, in your condition, alone here all day, and walking that dog...
- That dog!
- That dog?
He's never called me that before.
Well, now, lassie,
I wouldn't worry my wee head about that.
Remember, they're only humans, after all.
That's right, Miss Lady.
As my grandpappy,
Old Reliable, used to say...
I don't recollect if I've ever mentioned Old Reliable before.
Aye, you have, laddie.
- Frequently.
- Oh, yeah.
But now Darling is... Well...
We've always enjoyed our afternoon romp together.
But yesterday...
[chiming]
[barking]
[humming]
[whining]
No, Lady. No walk today.
[humming continues]
[barking]
No, Lady.
Not now.
Lady!
Drop that, Lady.
Drop it, I say.
It didn't hurt, really.
But Darling has never struck me... before.
[chuckling] Now, lassie.
Do not take it too seriously.
After all, at a time like this...
Why, yes, you see, Miss Lady, there comes a time in the life of all humans when, uh...
Well, as they put it, uh...
Birds and the bees?
Or... Well, uh...
The stork. You know. Uh, no?
- Well, uh...
- What he's trying to say, lassie, is Darling is expecting a wee bairn.
Bairn?
He means a baby, Miss Lady.
Oh.
What's a baby?
[Jock] Well, they resemble humans.
[Trusty] But I'd say a mite smaller.
[Jock] Aye. And they walk on all fours.
[Trusty] And if I remember correctly, they bellow a lot.
Aye. And they're very expensive.
You will not be permitted to play with it.
But they're mighty sweet.
And very, very soft.
Just a cute little bundle. [chuckles]
[Tramp] Of trouble.
Yeah. They scratch, pinch, pull ears...
Aw, but shucks.
Any dog can take that.
It's what they do to your happy home.
Move it over, will you, friend?
Homewreckers, that's what they are.
Look here, laddie.
Who are you to barge in?
The voice of experience, buster.
[chuckles] Just wait till junior gets here.
You get the urge for a nice comfortable scratch, and, "Put that dog out!"
He'll get fleas all over the baby."
You start barking at some strange mutt.
[barks]
"Stop that racket.
You'll wake the baby."
And then!
Then they hit you in the room and board department.
Remember those nice, juicy cuts of beef?
[Tramp] Forget them.
Leftover baby food.
And that nice, warm bed by the fire?
[chuckles]
[thunderclap]
A leaky doghouse.
- Oh, dear.
- Do not listen, lassie.
No human is that cruel.
Of course not, Miss Lady.
Why, everybody knows a dog's best friend is his human.
[Tramp laughing]
Oh, come on now, fellas.
You haven't fallen for that old line, now have you?
Aye. And we've no need for mongrels and their radical ideas.
Off with you, now. Off with you!
- OK, Sandy.
- The name's Jock.
- OK, Jock.
- Heather Lad of Glencairn to you!
OK, OK, OK.
But remember this, Pigeon.
A human heart has only so much room for love and affection.
When a baby moves in, the dog moves out.
[Jim] Uh-huh.
Oh, let's see. That'll be about...
Oh, well.
[pounding]
[Jim] Darling?
There isn't any way we can tell for sure what it's going to be, is there?
[Darling] I'm afraid not.
Nobody ever knows for certain.
All we can do is hope.
[chiming]
[footsteps]
[yawning]
[wind howling]
[door closes]
Darling, are you sure you want watermelon?
[Darling] Mm-hmm.
Oh, and some chop suey too.
Chop su...
[sighs] Oh, all right, darling.
[door shuts]
[women giggling and chattering]
[woman 1]... the cutest thing.
- [woman 2] Those booties!
- [woman 3] That bonnet.
- [woman 4] Adorable.
- [woman 5] Don't you love showers?
[woman 6] I've never seen you more beautiful.
[woman 7] Isn't she radiant?
[woman 8] That's just what I told Bill.
"Bill", I said, "Darling looks positively radiant."
In all my days,
"I've never seen anyone as radiant."
[men laughing]
[man 1] Aw, Jim, you look terrible.
[man 2] Absolutely horrible.
[man 3] I never saw you look worse.
[man 4] Cheer up, Jim. Old Doc Jones has never lost a father yet.
[laughter]
[thunderclap]
[Jim] Yes, Aunt Sarah, it's a boy.
Uh-huh, a boy. And...
What's that?
Eyes?
Oh, what colour are they?
Well... Oh, gosh. l-I forgot to look.
A boy. It's a boy, it's a... Doctor!
Doctor, it's a boy!
Yes, yes, I know.
Uh-huh, a boy.
Oh, boy, oh, boy!
It's a boy, it's a boy, it's a boy!
[Aunt Sarah on phone]
Hello? Hello, Jim?
Are you there, Jim?
Central, we've been cut off.
Hello? Hello?
Hello!
[baby crying]
[crying continues]
[thinking] What is a baby?
I just can't understand
It must be something wonderful
It must be something grand
Cos everybody's smiling
In a kind and wistful way
And they haven't even noticed
That I am around today
[Jim whistling]
[thinking] What is a baby, anyway?
[baby crying]
Oh, what is a baby?
I must find out today
What makes Jim Dear and Darling
Act this way?
[baby cooing]
[Darling humming]
Oh, my little star sweeper
I'll sweep the stardust
For you
[humming]
Little soft, fluffy sleeper
Here comes a pink cloud
For you
[humming]
Little wandering angel
Fold up your wings
Close your eyes
[humming]
And may love be your keeper
[humming]
There, now.
Little star sweeper.
Dream on.
Well, that should do it.
We've got enough here to take us halfway to China.
[grunting]
[Jim] Darling. Darling!
We haven't much time.
[Darling] Jim, I just can't leave him.
He's still so small and helpless.
[Jim] He'll be all right.
Now come on. If he wakes up we'll never get away.
Jim, I feel so guilty deserting him like this.
[Jim] Nonsense.
[Jim] Hey.
What's the matter with Lady?
[Darling] She thinks we're running out on him.
[Jim] Oh, don't worry, old girl.
We'll be back in a few days.
[Darling] And Aunt Sarah will be here.
- [Jim] With you here to help her...
- [doorbell rings]
[Jim] There's the old girl now.
Coming, Aunt Sarah. Coming!
[Sarah panting] Sorry I'm late, dears.
Hope I haven't kept you waiting.
- [Jim] Let me take your things.
- No, no.
No fussing. I know my way around.
On your way, now.
Mustn't miss your train.
Have a good time, and don't worry about a thing.
Goodbye, dears. Goodbye, goodbye.
[Jim and Darling] Goodbye.
[Sarah] Now to see that big nephew of mine.
- Cootchie-cootchie-coo.
- [cooing]
Oh, you adorable little...
[gasps] Good gracious!
What are you doing here?
Go on, now. Shoo, shoo.
Scat. Get out of here.
- [baby crying]
- Aw, there, there.
Aunt Sarah won't let that dog frighten you anymore.
No, no, no.
[baby crying]
[Sarah] Rock-a-bye, baby
on the treetop
When the wind blows
We are Siamese
if you please
[purring]
We are Siamese
if you don't please
Now we looking over
our new domicile
If we like we stay
for maybe quite a while
[barking]
Do you seeing that thing swimming round and round?
Yesss.
Maybe we can reaching in and make it drown.
If we sneaking up upon it carefully...
There will be a head
for you, a tail for me
[crashing]
[baby crying]
Do you hear what I hear?
[purrs] A baby cry.
Where we're finding baby
there are milk nearby
If we look in baby buggy
there could be
Plenty milk for you
and also some for me
[growling]
- [screeching]
- [barking]
[Sarah] What's going on down there?
[gasps] Merciful heavens! My darlings.
- My precious pets.
- [yowling]
Oh. Ooh, that wicked animal.
Attacking my poor, innocent little angels.
[man] Good afternoon, ma'am.
What can I do for you?
I want a muzzle.
A good, strong muzzle.
Oh, yes, ma'am.
Now here's our latest.
Combination leash and muzzle.
Now, we'll just slip it on like this, and... No! No, no, no.
Nice doggy. No, don't wiggle.
Steady, now.
Now... Now, now.
Careful, you little...
[Sarah] Watch out.
- [man] Careful, doggy.
- [Sarah] Come back!
Get over here, I say.
Come back here.
[horn beeping]
[horn beeping]
[streetcar bell ringing]
[barking]
[snarling]
[growling]
[whimpering]
[panting, snorts]
Hey, Pige, what are you doing on this side of the tracks?
I thought you...
Wh?
Aw, you poor kid.
Oh, we've got to get this off.
Hmm.
I think I know the very place.
Come on.
Well, here we are.
- The zoo?
- Sure.
No, no. This way.
Follow me.
[guard humming]
- [Lady] Oh.
- What's the matter, Pige?
- We can't go in.
- Why not?
- [Lady] The sign says...
- [Tramp] Yeah, well, that's...
- That's the angle.
- Angle?
Look. We'll just wait for the right...
Uh-oh. Here we are now.
Just lay low.
[whistling]
[barking]
- [guard] Hey, you!
- I beg your pardon.
- Were you addressing?
- What's the matter? Can't you read?
Why, yes, in several languages.
Oh, a wise guy, eh?
All right, now, what's this creature doing here?
- He's not my dog.
- Oh, he's not, eh?
Go away. Get down.
Go on. Why, certainly not, officer.
I suppose you'll be tellin' me next it was the dog that was whistling, eh?
- [man] I'm certain I don't know.
- Oh! So I'm a liar now, am I?
Well, you listen to me.
A-ha! Resisting an officer of the law.
You're gonna pay.
Ow!
Pull a knife on me, will you?
Trying to assassinate me, you are.
Carrying concealed weapons.
[arguing continues]
Come on, Pige.
The place is ours.
[arguing continues]
We better go through this place from A to Z.
Apes.
No, no. No use even asking them.
They wouldn't understand.
They wouldn't?
Uh-uh. Too closely related to humans.
Uh-oh.
[Tramp] Alligators.
Now there's an idea.
Say, Al, do you suppose you could nip this contraption off for us?
[echoing] Glad to oblige.
Whoa. Whoa!
[hysterical laughter]
Ha! If anybody ever needed a muzzle, it's him.
- [animal] Timber!
- Pigeon, look out!
Now what harebrained idiot would...
Hey, look. A beaver.
There's the answer to our problem.
Let me see here.
Six-foot-six and seven-sixteenth inches.
Pardon me, friend.
- I wonder if you'd do us a little...
- Busy, sonny. Busy.
Can't stop to gossip now.
Got to slide this sycamore to the... [straining]
...swamp.
Well, this will only take a second.
Only a second? Listen, sonny.
Do you realise every second,
70 centimetres of water is wasted over that spillway?
- [Tramp] Yeah, but...
- Gotta get this log movin', sonny.
Gotta get it moving.
Think the cuttin' takes the time?
It's the doggone haulin'.
[straining]
[Tramp] The haulin'. Exactly.
- Now, what you need...
- I'd better bisect this section here.
What you need is a log puller.
[shouting] I said a log puller!
I ain't deaf, sonny.
There's no need to...
Did you say log puller?
And by a lucky coincidence you see before you, modelled by the lovely little lady, the new, improved, patented, handy dandy, never-fail little giant log puller.
The busy beaver's friend.
You don't say?
Guaranteed not to wear, tear, rip or ravel.
Turn around and show the customer the merchandise.
And it cuts log-hauling time 66 per cent.
Sixty-six per cent, eh?
[giggles] Think of that.
- Well, how's it work?
- Why, it's no work at all.
You merely slip this ring over the limb like this, and haul it off.
Uh, say...
You mind if I slip it on for size?
Help yourself, friend.
OK. Don't mind if I do.
How do you get the consarned thing off, sonny?
Glad you brought that up, friend.
To remove it, simply place the strap between your teeth...
Like this?
Correct, friend. Now bite hard.
You see?
It's off.
Say, that is simple.
Well, friend, we'll be on our way now, so...
Uh-uh. Not so fast now, sonny...
I'll have to make certain it's satisfactory before we settle on a price.
Oh, no, it's all yours, friend.
You can keep it.
I can, eh?
I can?
Uh-huh. It's a free sample.
Well, thanks a lot.
[chuckles] Thanks ever so...
Say!
It works swell.
[Lady] But when she put that horrible muzzle on me...
Say no more. I get the whole picture.
Aunts. Cats. Muzzles.
Well, that's what comes of tying yourself down to one family.
Haven't you a family?
One for every day of the week.
The point is, none of them have me.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
It's simple.
You see... [sniffing]
Hey. [sniffing]
Something tells me it's suppertime.
Come on. I'll show you what I mean.
Now take the Schultzes here.
Little Fritzie, that's me, Pige, makes this his Monday home.
- Monday home?
- Ach, ja.
[with German accent]
Monday is Mama Schultz cooking der Wiener Schnitzel.
Mmm.
Delicious.
[Irish accent] O'Brien's is where little Mike, that's me again, Pige,
- comes every Tuesday.
- Every Tuesday?
Begorra. And that's when they're havin' their darlin' corned beef.
You see, Pige, when you're footloose and collar-free, well, you take nothing but the best.
- [singing in Italian]
- Hey!
Tony's!
Of course.
The very place for a very special occasion.
This way, Pige.
I have my own private entrance.
Wait here.
Just one minute. I'm a-comin'. I'm...
What's a-matter? Somebody's a-makin' da April Fool with...
[barking]
Oh, hello, Butch.
Where you been so long?
Hey, Joe, look who's here.
Well, what do you know? It's Butch.
Hey, hey, hey!
Joe, bring some bones for Butchy before he eat me up.
- [chuckling]
- OK, Tony. OK.
Bones a-coming up.
[barking]
Huh?
Ahh!
What's this?
Hey, Joe, look.
Butchy, he's got a new girlfriend.
Well, a son of a gun!
He's a got a cockerel Spanish a-girl.
Hey, she's a pretty sweet kiddo, Butch.
You take-a Tony's advice and a-settle down with this-a one, eh?
"This a-one"?
This one. This... Oh!
Tony, you know.
He's a-not a-speaking
English a-pretty good.
[chuckles, clears throat]
Now, first we fix-a the table.
- Here's your bones, Tony.
- OK, bones. Bones?
[Tony] What's the matter with you,
Joe? I break-a your face.
Tonight, Butch, he gets the best in the house.
[Joe] OK, Tony, you're the boss.
Now, tell me, what's your pleasure?
A la carte? Dinner?
[barking]
A-ha. OK.
Hey, Joe.
Butch-a, he says he wants-a two spaghetti speciale.
Heavy on the meats-a ball.
Tony, dogs don't talk.
- He's a-talkin' to me!
- OK, he's a-talkin' to you.
You the boss.
Mamma mia. [grumbling in Italian]
Now here you are.
The best spaghetti in town.
[slurping]
For this is the night
It's a beautiful night
And we call it
Bella notte
Look at the skies
They have stars in their eyes
On this lovely bella notte
Side by side
With your loved one
You'll find enchantment here
The night will weave its magic spell
When the one you love is near
For
[both] This is the night
And the heavens are right
On this lovely
Bella notte
[chorus] This is the night
It's a beautiful night
And we call it
Bella notte
Look at the skies
They have stars in their eyes
On this lovely
Bella notte
Side by side with your loved one
You'll find enchantment here
The night will weave its magic spell
When the one you love is near
For this is the night
And the heavens are right
On this lovely
Bella notte
[rooster crowing]
Oh! Oh, dear.
Is something wrong, Pige?
- It's morning.
- Yeah. [stretches]
So it is.
I should have been home hours ago.
Why? Because you still believe in that,
"in the faithful old dog tray" routine?
Aw, come on, Pige.
Open up your eyes.
Open my eyes?
To what a dog's life can really be.
I'll show you what I mean.
Look down there.
Tell me what you see.
Well, I see nice homes with yards and fences.
Exactly. Life on a leash.
Look again, Pige.
[Tramp] There's a great big hunk of world down there with no fence around it.
Where two dogs can find adventure and excitement.
And beyond those distant hills, who knows what wonderful experiences?
And it's all ours for the taking, Pige.
It's all ours.
It sounds wonderful.
But?
But who'd watch over the baby?
You win.
Come on.
I'll take you home.
[man whistling]
[humming]
It's a beautiful night
And they call it...
[chickens clucking]
[Tramp] Not to change the subject, but...
Ever chased chickens?
I should say not!
Oh, ho! Then you've never lived.
- But we shouldn't.
- I know.
That's what makes it fun.
Aw, come on, kid.
Start building some memories.
But we... We won't hurt the chickens?
Hurt 'em? No!
[Tramp] We'll just stir 'em up a bit.
[Tramp] Just look at those fat, lazy biddies.
Why, they should've been up hours ago.
[barking]
[squawking]
Some fun, eh, kid?
[man] Hey, what's going on in there?
- [gunshot]
- What's that?
That's the signal to get going. Come on.
[gunshots]
- This is living, eh, kid?
- Is it?
Come on, Pige. Follow me.
You know, there's a little bit of bird dog in all of us, eh, Pige?
Pige? Pige?
Pige? Where are you, Pige?
Pige?
[echoing] Pigeon?
Oh, Pige!
[dogs howling and barking]
[howling mournful tune]
[howling continues]
[whimpering]
[dog] Hey.
Hey, Dachsie, how we coming?
Just one more chorus and we're out.
OK. On a downbeat.
- One, two...
- [clanking]
[man] Put her in number four, Bill,
- while I check her license.
- OK.
[Bill] All right, baby, in here.
Well, look yous guys,
Miss Park Avenue herself.
[chuckles] Blimey.
A regular bloomin' debutante.
Yeah. And pipe the crown jewel she's wearin'.
Hey, whatcha in for, sweetheart?
Putting fleas on the butler?
All right, you guys. Lay off, will you?
Aw, what's the matter, Peg?
We was only havin' a bit of sport, we was.
Can't you see the poor kid's scared enough already?
Pay no attention, my little ochi chernye.
That's right, dearie.
They don't mean no real harm.
It's like Gorky says in Lower Depths, quote:
"Miserable being must find more miserable being.
Then he's happy."
- Unquote.
- Boris is a philosopher.
Besides, little bublichki, wearing license here, that is like waving, you should excuse the expression, red flag in front of bull.
My license?
But what's wrong with it?
There ain't nothin' wrong with it, dearie.
Confidential, there's not one dog here who would not give left hind leg for such a knick-knack.
That's your passport to freedom, honey.
- Without it...
- [clanking]
Hey. Hey, yous guys, look.
Poor Nutsy is takin' the long walk.
[Lady] Where is he taking him?
[dog] Through the one-way door, sister.
[door locking]
You... You mean he's...
Oh, well.
A short life and a merry one.
Yeah, that's what the Tramp always says.
- The Tramp?
- Now there's a bloke what never gets caught.
He's given the slip to every dogcatcher in this burg.
You won't believe this, dearie, but no matter how tight a jam he's in, that Tramp always finds some way out.
I can quite easily believe that.
Ah, but remember, my friends, even Tramp has his Achilles heel.
Pardon me, amigo.
What is this "chilli heel"?
Achilles heel, Pedro.
This is meaning his, uh, weaknesses.
Oh. Oh, the dames. Yeah.
[chuckles] He has an eye for a well-turned paw, he has.
Let's see. There's been Lulu.
[dog] Yeah, and Trixie.
[Dachsie] Und Fifi.
And my sister,
Rosita Chiquita Juanita Chihuahua.
I think.
What a dog.
Yeah. Tell us about it, Peg.
What a dog!
Peg used to be in the Dog and Pony Follies.
He's a tramp
But they love him
Breaks a new heart every day
He's a tramp
They adore him
And I only hope he'll stay that way
- He's a tramp
- [howling]
He's a scoundrel
- He's a rounder
- [whimpering]
He's a cad
He's a tramp
But I love him
Yes, even I have got it pretty bad
- [howling]
- You can never tell
When he'll show up
He gives you plenty of trouble
I guess he's just a no-count pup
But I wish that he were double
- He's a tramp
- Bum-bum-bum-ruff
- He's a rover
- Bum-bum-bum-ruff
And there's nothin' more to say
Bum-bum-bum-ruff
[Peg] If he's a tramp
He's a good one
And I wish that
I could travel his way
Wish that I could travel his way
Wish that I could travel his way
Yeah.
But he never takes them serious.
Ah, but someday he is meeting someone different.
[Boris] Some delicate, fragile creature who's giving him a wish to shelter and protect.
Like Miss Park Avenue here, eh, matey?
Mm-hmm. Could be.
- But when he does...
- Yeah. I'm way ahead of ya.
Under the spell of true love...
The poor chump grows careless...
The Cossacks are picking him up...
And it's curtains for the Tramp.
[door opens]
[man] It's the little cocker, Bill.
- In number four.
- [Bill] OK.
All right, baby.
They've come to take you home.
You're too nice a girl to be in this place.
Courage, man.
Courage!
But, uh...
I've never even considered matrimony.
Nor I.
But no matter which of us she accepts, we'll always be the best of friends.
Now remember, not a word about her unfortunate experience.
- We don't want to hurt her feelings.
- Uh, yeah. Yeah.
Lassie.
Miss Lady, ma'am.
Please, I don't want to see anybody.
Now, now, lassie.
Don't feel that way about it.
Of course not, Miss Lady.
Why, some of the finest people
I ever tracked down
- were jailbirds.
- [Jock] Quiet!
You great loony!
Uh, please, lassie.
We've come with a proposition.
[Jock] For helpin' ya.
Help me? What do you mean?
Well, now...
You see, lassie...
Neither of us is as young as we used to be.
But we're still in the prime of life.
Aye.
And we've both got very comfortable homes.
[Trusty] That's right. Where we know you'll be welcome and appreciated, Miss Lady.
So... So, to come directly to the point...
[clears throat]
If you could, uh, find it possible to, uh...
To, uh...
You're both very kind, and I do appreciate it.
- But...
- [Tramp] Oh, Pigeon.
Oh, Pi...
[Tramp] Oh! Oh, hi, boys.
Anything new in the kennel club set?
[chuckling]
A little something
I picked up for you, Pige.
Hmpf.
Looks like I'm the one that's in the doghouse.
If this person is annoying you, Miss Lady...
We'll gladly throw the rascal out.
That won't be necessary. Thank you.
Very well, ma'am.
You... You...
...mongrel!
Aw, come on, Pige.
- It wasn't my fault.
- Hmpf.
I thought you were right behind me. Honest.
When I heard they'd taken you to the pound...
Don't even mention that horrible place.
[sobbing] I was so embarrassed and...
- And frightened.
- Oh, now, now.
Who could ever harm a cute little trick like you?
[Lady] Trick? Trick!
- That reminds me, who is Trixie?
- Trixie?
And Lulu and Fifi and Rosita Chiquita wh...
- Whatever her name is.
- Chiquita...
Oh! Yes! Well, l-I...
As far as I'm concerned, you needn't worry about your old heel.
[stammering] My heel?
I don't need you to shelter and protect me.
- But...
- If you grow careless, don't blame me.
I don't care if the Cossacks do pick you up! Goodbye.
- And take this with you.
- [thunderclap]
[Lady sobbing]
[board banging]
[thunderclap]
[growling]
[barking]
[barking]
Stop that.
Hush, now, hush.
[barking continues]
[Sarah] Stop that racket!
[Tramp] What's wrong?
- A rat!
- Where?
Upstairs, in the baby's room!
- How do I get in?
- The little door.
On the porch.
[thunderclap]
[sniffing]
[growling]
[snarling]
[barking]
[squeaking]
[squeaking]
[baby crying]
- [crashing]
- [squeaking]
[crying continues]
[gasping] Merciful heavens!
Oh! Oh, you poor little darling.
No, no, no.
Thank goodness you're not hurt.
You... You vicious brutes. Back!
Get back!
Go on! Get back!
The pound. The pound, that's it.
I'll call the pound.
[barking]
Come here, you. Come here!
Come on, come on.
Come along.
I'll call them this minute.
[whimpering]
I won't sleep with that brute in the house.
[barking]
[telephone ringing]
[Sarah] Hello? Hello!
[whimpering]
I don't care if you are alone there, young man.
I insist you pick him up immediately.
[bell rings]
[Jim] Darling, look.
[Sarah] If you want my advice you'll destroy that animal at once.
[man] Don't worry, ma'am.
We've been after this one for months.
We'll take care of him.
- [Darling] What do you suppose?
- [Jim] What's going on here?
[man] Just picking up a stray, mister.
Come on, giddup. [whip cracks]
Caught him attacking a baby.
- [Jim] Heavens.
- My baby.
[both] Aunt Sarah!
[Darling] Aunt Sarah!
[both] Aunt Sarah!
I was certain he was no good the moment I first laid eyes on him.
Yeah, but, uh...
I never thought he'd do a thing like that.
[Sarah] I got there in time.
There they were...
[Jim] I'm sure there must be some mistake. Lady wouldn't...
[barking]
[Sarah] Watch out! That dog's loose.
Keep her away.
[Jim] Nonsense.
She's trying to tell us something.
- [barking continues]
- What is it, old girl?
What are you try...
Darling, Aunt Sarah, come here.
- [Darling] What is it?
- [Sarah gasps]
[Sarah] Aaah! A rat!
A rat?
We should've known.
I misjudged him.
Badly.
Come on. We got to stop that wagon.
But man, we don't know which way they've gone.
We'll track 'em down.
And then?
We'll hold 'em.
Hold 'em at bay.
Now what?
The scent. Follow the scent.
Ach. Let's face it, man.
We both know you've lost your sense of smell.
[howling]
[howling continues]
[howling]
[howling]
- [man] Get out of here.
- [barking]
Go on, get away.
[barking]
Easy. Go on, get away.
Watch it now. Watch it!
[horn honking]
[crowd murmuring]
Hi, Pige.
[whimpering]
[howling]
[Jim] All right, everybody, watch the birdy.
[growling]
- [squeaking]
- Steady, now.
[Jim] Hold it.
[coughing]
I guess I used a little too much.
Uh-oh.
Darling, visitors.
Visitors?
[Darling] Why, it's Jock.
[Jim] And good old Trusty.
Careful now, man.
Careful. It's a wee bit slippery.
[Trusty] Yes, it is.
[Jim] All right, boy. We'll let 'em in.
No, no, not you, young man.
You're going to take a nap.
Well, Merry Christmas.
Come in, come in.
If you'll just step into the parlour
[Jim] I'll see about refreshments.
Oh, darling, where did you put the dog biscuits?
The box Aunt Sarah sent for Christmas.
[Darling] In the kitchen, Jim dear.
Oh, no doubt about it.
They've got their mother's eyes.
Aye. [chuckles]
But there's a bit of their father in them too.
Well, and I see you finally acquired a collar.
Oh. Yes.
Complete with license.
Oh, yeah, a new collar.
Caught the scent the moment
I came in the house.
[Trusty] Trusty, I says,
Trusty, somebody's wearing a new collar.
'Course, my sense of smell is very highly developed.
Runs in the family, you know.
There'll be no livin' with him from now on.
As my grandpappy,
Old Reliable, used to say...
I don't recollect if I've ever mentioned Old Reliable before.
[all] No, you haven't, Uncle Trusty.
Huh?
I haven't?
Well, um...
As Old Reliable used to say...
He'd say, uh...
He'd say... uh...
Uh...
Hmm.
Doggone.
You know,
I clean forgot what it was he used to say.
[chuckling]
[chorus] Peace, my children
Of good will
Peace, my children
Peace
Be
Still
[Bella Notte]
The second star to the right
Shines in the night for you
To tell you that the dreams you plan
Really can come true
The second star to the right
Shines with a light so rare
And if it's Never Land you need
Its light will lead you there
Twinkle, twinkle little star
So we'll know where you are
Gleaming in the skies above
Lead us to the land
We dream of
And when ourjourney is through
Each time we say
Good night
We'll thank the little star that shines
The second from
The right
All this has happened before.
And it will all happen again.
But this time it happened in London.
It happened on a quiet street in Bloomsbury.
That corner house over there is the home of the Darling family.
And Peter Pan chose this particular house... because there were people here who believed in him.
There was Mrs Darling.
George, dear, do hurry. We mustn't be late for the party, you know.
Mrs Darling believed that Peter Pan was the spirit of youth.
- But Mr Darling--
- Mary, unless I find my cuff links... we don't go to the party.
And if we don't go to the party, I can never show my face in the office again.
And if I can never-- Ouch!
Well, Mr Darling was a practical man.
The boys, however,
John and Michael... believed Peter Pan was a real person... and made him the hero of all their nursery games.
Blast you, Peter Pan!
Take that! Give up,
Captain Hook? Give up?
Never! I'll teach you to cut off me hand!
Oh, no, John.
It was the left hand.
Oh, yes.
Thank you, Wendy.
Wendy, the eldest, not only believed... she was the supreme authority on Peter Pan... and all his marvellous adventures.
Oh, Nana, must we always take that nasty tonic?
Nana, the nursemaid, being a dog... kept her opinions to herself... and viewed the whole affair with a certain tolerance.
Take that!
Insolent boy!
I'll slash you to ribbons!
And I'll cut you to pieces.
- Aha!
- Ouch!
- Careful, Michael, my glasses.
- I'm sorry,John.
You'll never leave this ship alive!
Oh, yes, I will.
Take that!
Scuttle me bones, boy,
I'll slit your gizzard.
Oh, no, you won't.
Back, back, back, you villain!
- Insolent pup!
- Wicked pirate!
- Aha, I got ya.
- You didn't either.
You never touched me.
Take that and that!
And that!
Boys, boys, less noise, please.
- Oh, hello, Father.
- You old bilge rat.
Wh-Wh-What?
Now, see here, Michael--
Oh, not you, Father.
You see, he's Peter Pan.
- And John's Captain Hook.
- Yes, yes, of course.
Uh, have you seen my cuff--
Oh, Nana, for goodness sake!
Where are those cuff links?
- Cuff links, Father?
- Yes, the gold ones.
Michael, the buried treasure.
Where is it?
- I don't know.
- The map then.
- Where's the treasure map?
- It got lost.
- Good heavens, my shirt front!
- Hurray! You found it!
- You found it!
- Yes, so I have.
And hereafter--
Don't paw me, Michael.
This is my last clean--
No! No!
George, dear, we really must hurry or we'll be late--
- Mary, look!
- George.
- It's only chalk, Father.
- Why, Michael.
It's not his fault.
It's in the story.
- And Wendy says--
- Wendy? Story?
I might have known. Wendy!
- Wendy!
- Yes, Father?
- Would you kindly ex--
- Oh, Mother!
- You look simply lovely.
- Thank you, dear.
- Wendy.
-Just my old gown made over.
- But it did turn out rather nicely, didn't--
- Mary, if you don't mind.
- I'd like--
- Why, Father, what have you done to your shirt?
What have I-- Oh!
- Now, George, really.
It comes right off.
- That's no excuse.
Wendy, haven't I warned you?
Stuffing the boys' heads with a lot of silly stories.
- Oh, but they aren't.
- I say they are.
Captain Crook!
Peter Pirate!
- Peter Pan, Father.
- Pan! Pirate! Poppycock!
- Oh, no, Father. Father, have you--
- Oh, you don't understand.
Absolute poppycock!
And let me tell you, this ridiculous--
- Now, George.
- ""Now, George.''
""Now, George''!
Well, ""Now, George,'' will have his say!
- Please, dear.
- Mary, the child's growing up.
It's high time she had a room of her own.
- Father!
- George!
- What?
- No!
- I mean it!
Young lady, this is your last night in the nursery.
And that's my last word on the matter--
No!
No!
Oh!
Poor Nana.
""Poor Nana''?
This is the last straw!
Out! Out, I say!
- No, Father, no!
- Yes!
There'll be no more dogs for nursemaids in this house!
Goodbye, Nana.
""Poor Nana.''
Oh, yes, ""Poor Nana.''
But ""Poor Father''?
Oh, no!
Blast it!
Where is that rope?
Oh, thank you.
Dash it all, Nana, don't look at me like that.
It's nothing personal.
It's just that--
Well, you're not really a nurse at all.
You're, well, a dog.
And the children aren't puppies.
They're people.
And sooner or later, Nana, people have to grow up.
But, Mother,
I don't want to grow up.
Now, dear, don't worry about it any more tonight.
He called Peter Pan
""absolute poppycock.''
I'm sure he didn't mean it,John.
Father was just upset.
Poor Nana, out there all alone.
No more tears, Michael.
It's a warm night.
She'll be all right.
- Mother.
- What is it, dear?
- Buried treasure.
- Now, children.
Don't judge your father too harshly.
After all, he really loves you very much.
Oh, don't lock it, Mother.
He might come back.
- ""He''?
- Yes, uh, Peter Pan.
You see, I found something that belongs to him.
- Oh? And what's that?
- His shadow.
- ""Shadow''?
- Mmm, Nana had it.
But I--
I took it away.
Oh? Yes, of course.
Good night, dear.
But, George, do you think the children will be safe without Nana?
Safe? Of course they'll be safe. Why not?
Well, Wendy said something about a shadow, and I--
- Shadow? Whose shadow?
- Peter Pan's.
Oh, Peter Pan--
Peter Pan!
You don't say. Goodness gracious, whatever shall we do?
- But, George-- Really, I--
- Sound the alarm!
- Call Scotland Yard!
- There must have been someone.
Oh, Mary, of all the impossible, childish fiddle-faddle.
Peter Pan indeed. How can we expect the children to grow up and be practical...
- George, dear.
- when you're as bad as they are.
- Please.
- No wonder Wendy gets these idiotic ideas.
Over there, Tink, in its den.
Is it there?
Must be here somewhere.
Tink! Shh!
Stop playing and help me find my shadow.
Shadow. Oh, shadow.
Huh?
Aha!
Peter Pan! Oh, Peter!
I knew you'd come back.
I saved your shadow for you.
Oh, I do hope it isn't rumpled.
You know, you look exactly the way I thought you would.
Oh, a little taller perhaps.
But then--
Oh, you can't stick it on with soap, Peter.
It needs sewing.
That's the proper way to do it.
Although, come to think of it,
I've never thought about it before.
Uh, sewing shadows, I mean.
Of course, I knew it was your shadow the minute I saw it.
And I said to myself, I said, ""I'll put it away for him until he comes back.
Oh, he's sure to come back.''
And you did, didn't you, Peter?
After all, one can't leave his shadow lying about and not miss it sooner or later.
Uh, don't you agree? But what
I still don't understand is how
Nana got it in the first place.
She really isn't-- Oh, sit down.
It won't take long.
She really isn't vicious, you know.
She's a wonderful nurse.
- Although Father says--
- Girls talk too much.
Yes, girls talk too--
Hmm? Oh.
- Well, get on with it, girl.
- Uh, my name is Wendy.
- Uh, Wendy Moira Angela Darl--
- Wendy's enough.
Oh, uh, but how did
Nana get your shadow, Peter?
Jumped at me the other night at the window.
Well, what were you doing there?
- I came to listen to the stories.
- My stories?
- But they're all about you.
- Of course.
That's why I like 'em.
I tell 'em to the Lost Boys.
The Lost Boys--
Oh, I remember.
- They're your men.
- Uh-huh.
I'm so glad you came back tonight.
I might never have seen you.
- Why?
- Because I have to grow up tomorrow.
- Grow up!
- Tonight's my last night in the nursery.
But that means no more stories.
- Mm-hmm.
- No!
I won't have it.
Come on!
Bu-Bu-But where are we going?
To Never Land.
- Never Land!
- You'll never grow up there.
Oh, Peter, it will be so wonderful.
But wait.
What would Mother say?
Mother? What's Mother?
Why, Peter, a mother is someone who-- who loves and cares for you.
- And-- And tells you stories--
- Good! You can be our mother.
- Come on.
- Now, just a minute, I--
Let me see now.
I-I have to pack.
Oh, and I must leave a note when I'll be back.
Of course, I couldn't stay too long.
And then I'll have to--
Oh, but Never Land.
Oh, I--
I-I'm so happy I--
I think I'll give you a-- a kiss.
What's a-- a kiss?
Oh, well, uh,
I-I'll show you.
- Oh!
- Stop! Stop it, Tink!
John,John, wake up!
He's here.
Huh? Jiminy!
Ooh, what in the world was that?
Tinker Bell.
Don't know what got into her.
Hello, Peter Pan.
I'm Michael.
And my name is John.
How do you do?
- Hello.
- Oh, look, a firefly.
- A pixie.
- Amazing!
- What's the pixie doing?
- Talking.
- What did she say?
- She says you're a big, ugly girl.
Oh. Well, I think she's lovely.
- Well, come on, Wendy, let's go.
- Where are we going?
- To Never Land.
- Never Land!
- Peter's taking us.
- ""Us''?
Well, of course. I-I couldn't go without Michael and John.
Oh, I should like very much to cross swords with some real buccaneers.
Yes, and fight pirates too.
Well, all right, but ya gotta take orders.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Me too.
But, Peter, how do we get to Never Land?
- Fly, of course.
- ""Fly''?
It's easy. All you have to do is to-- is to--
Is to--
- Ha! That's funny.
- What's the matter?
- Don't you know?
- Oh, sure.
It's-- It's just that
I never thought about it before.
Say, that's it!
You think of a wonderful thought.
- Any happy, little thought?
- Uh-huh.
- Like toys at Christmas?
- Sleigh bells, snow?
Yep! Watch me now.
Here I go!
It's easier than pie.
- He can fly!
- He can fly!
He flewed!
- Now you try.
- I'll think of a mermaid lagoon... underneath a magic moon.
I'll think I'm in a pirate's cave.
I think I'll be an Indian brave.
Now everybody try.
One, two, three!
We can fly! We can fly!
We can fly!
This won't do.
What's the matter with you?
All it takes is faith and trust.
Oh! And something
I forgot. Dust!
- Dust?
- Dust?
Yep, just a little bit of pixie dust.
Now, think of the happiest things.
- It's the same as having wings.
- Let's all try it just once more.
Look! We're rising off the floor.
-Jiminy!
- Oh, my! We can fly!
- You can fly!
- We can fly!
Come on, everybody.
Here we go!
Off to Never Land!
Think of a wonderful thought
Any merry little thought
Think of Christmas
Think of snow
Think of sleigh bells
Off you go like reindeer in the sky
You can fly, you can fly
You can fly
Think of the happiest things
It's the same as having wings
Take the path that moonbeams make
If the moon is still awake you'll see him wink his eye
You can fly, you can fly
You can fly
Up you go with a heigh and ho
To the stars beyond the blue
There's a Never Land waiting for you
Where all your happy dreams come true
Every dream that you dream will come true
Come on, Nana!
When there's a smile in your heart
There's no better time to start
Think of all thejoy you'll find
When you leave the world behind and bid your cares goodbye
You can fly, you can fly
You can fly, you can fly
You can fly
There it is, Wendy. Second star to the right and straight on till morning.
When there's a smile in your heart
There's no better time to start
Think of all thejoy you'll find when you leave the world behind
And bid your cares goodbye
You can fly, you can fly
You can fly, you can fly
You can fly
You can fly, you can fly
You can fly
Oh, a pirate's life is a wonderful life
A-rovin'over the sea
Give me a career as a buccaneer
It's the life of a pirate for me, oh
The life of a pirate for me
Oh, a pirate's life is a wonderful life
They never bury your bones
For when it's all over a jolly sea rover drops in on his friend, Davy Jones
Oh, my good friend
Davy Jones
- Good morning, shipmates.
- And what's good about it, Mr Smee?
Here we are, collecting barnacles on this miserable island.
While his nibs plays ring-around-the-rosy with Peter Pan.
Look out. It might go off.
We ought to be tending to the business of looting ships.
Why, I've almost forgotten how to slit a throat.
- Better hop it.
- And tell the captain... we wants to put to sea, see?
Peter Pan--
Blast that Peter Pan!
If I could only find his hideout,
I'd trap him in his lair.
But where is it?
Mermaid Lagoon?
No, we've searched that.
We've combed Cannibal Cove.
H-Here! No. No, no, no!
That's Indian terri--
But wait.
Those redskins know this island better than I do me own ship.
Ah...
I wonder.
- Good morning, Captain.
- I've got it!
Tiger Lily, Smee!
T-Tiger Lily, Captain?
The Chief's daughter.
She'll know where Pan is hiding.
B-B-But, but will she talk, Captain?
Oh, a little persuasion might be in order.
Now let me see.
Boiling in oil?
Keelhauling? Marooning?
A pirate's life is a wonderful l-life
You'll find adventure and sport
But live every minute for all that is in it
The life of a pirate is short
Oh, the life--
Now let me see, where was I?
Oh, dear, dear, dear Captain Hook.
Shooting a man in the middle of his cadenza?
It ain't good form, you know.
""Good form,'' Mr Smee?
Blast good form!
Did Pan show good form when he did this to me?
Why, Captain, cutting your hand off was only a childish prank, you might say.
Aye! But throwing it to the crocodile!
That cursed beast liked the taste of me so well... he's followed me ever since, licking his chops... for the rest of me.
And he'd have had you by now, Captain... if he hadn't swallowed that alarm clock.
But now when he's about, he warns ya as ya might say with his tick-tock... tick-tock, tick-tock.
Smee? Smee!
Oh, save me, Smee!
Please, don't let him get me, Smee!
Please, don't let him get me, Smee! Smee!
Here now, shame on ya.
Upsettin' the poor Captain.
There'll be no handouts today.
Shoo now, shoo!
Go on, go on, off it. Off with ya,
I say, go away, go away, out of here.
- Is he gone, Smee?
- Aye, Captain, all clear.
- Nothin' to worry about.
- Oh, Smee, Smee.
I can't stand it any longer.
I tell you, I can't.
Now, now, now, now, Captain.
Just relax.
What you need is a shave.
A nice soothing shave.
There now.
Oh, a pirate's life is a wonderful life
A-sailing over the sea
Give me a career as a--
Captain, you know,
I can't help noticin'... you just ain't been your usual jolly self of late.
Give me a career as a buccaneer
And the crew's gettin' a might uneasy, Captain.
That is, what's left of it.
Now, why don't we put to sea, see? Leave Never Land.
Forget Peter Pan.
There now!
Give me a career as a buccaneer
We'd all be a lot happier, not to mention a lot healthier.
Captain? Oh, dear! I never shaved him this close before.
Now, don't worry, Captain.
I-It must be somewhere about.
Get up, you idiot!
Aye, aye, sir.
Ooh! I found it, Captain.
- Good as new.
- Why, you blithering blockhead!
- Peter Pan ahoy!
- What? What? Where away?
Three points off the starboard bow!
Swoggle me eyes!
It is Pan!
Headed this way with some more of those scurvy brats!
Mr Smee, pipe up the crew!
A-Aye, aye, sir. Uh, pipe up the crew. Uh, pipe up the crew.
All hands on deck!
All hands on deck!
All hands on deck!
All hands on deck!
Look alive, you swabs!
- We've got him this time, Mr Smee.
- That we have, Captain.
Man the Long Tom, you bilge rats!
- I've waited years for this.
- That's not countin' the holidays either.
Double the powder and shorten the fuse!
Shorten the powder and double the fuse!
A pretty sight, Mr Smee.
We'll pot 'em like sitting ducks.
- All right, men! Range 42.
- ""Range 42.''
- Elevation 65.
- ""Elevation 65.''
- Three degrees west.
- ""Three degrees west.''
Steady now! Steady!
Oh, Peter, it's just as
I've always dreamed it would be.
Oh, look,John, there's Mermaid Lagoon.
By Jove!
And the Indian encampment!
Oh, look, there's
Captain Hook and the pirates.
Look out!
Quick, Tink, take Wendy and the boys to the island.
I'll stay here and draw Hook's fire.
Hook! Hook!
You codfish! Here!
Tinker Bell? Not so fast.
Please, Tinker Bell.
We can't keep up with you.
Tinker Bell! Wait!
Ouch!
So!
- Who ya shovin'?
- Who ya shovin'?
- You! That's who!
I'll show you!
Huh? Orders from Pan?
- Hold it, men!
- What's the orders, Tink?
- A terrible what?
- Wendy Bird.
- ""Wendy Bird''?
- Flying this way?
- Uh, Pan's orders are--
What? Smash it?
- Kick it?
- Stomp it?
- Stomp it?
- Oh! Shoot it down!
- Shoot it down!
- Yeah!
- Yeah, shoot it down!
- Come on, follow Tink!
- Follow Tink!
- Let's go!
- Yeah, come on. Let's go then!
- We're gonna get 'er!
- I see it!
- Me too!
- Me too!
Ready, aim... fire!
Oh, Peter, you saved my life.
- Are you hurted, Wendy?
- No, Michael.
Good heavens, Wendy, you might have been killed.
- Hey! Hey! Pan!
- We followed your orders, Pan!
- Hey, Pan, I got it with my skull buster!
- Ya did not! We did!
- I did it, Pan! I did it!
- No, I did!
Attention! Well...
I'm certainly proud of you, you blockheads!
- I bring ya a mother to tell ya stories--
- A mother?
- And you shoot her down.
- Well, Tink said it was a bird!
- Tink said what?
- Well, she said you said to shoot it down!
Tinker Bell. Tink!
Come here. You're charged with high treason, Tink.
Are you guilty or not guilty?
Guilty? But don't ya know ya might have killed her?
Tinker Bell!
I hereby banish you forever.
Please, not forever.
Well, for a week then. Come on, Wendy,
I'll show you the island.
Oh, Peter, uh, the mermaids?
- Aw, let's go huntin'!
- Tigers?
- Naw, bears.
- Naw, bears.
Personally, I should prefer to see the aborigines.
- And the Indians too.
- All right, men!
Go out and capture a few Indians.
-John, you be the leader.
- I shall try to be worthy of my post.
Forward! March!
- Come on, bear.
- Oh, Michael, do be careful.
Come on, Wendy.
I'll show you the mermaids.

Oh, Blackfoot tribe.
Belongs to the Algonquin group.
- Quite savage, you know.
- Uh, let's go get 'em.
- Come on! We'll get 'em!
- Gentlemen, gentlemen.
- First, we must plan our strategy.
- Uh, what's strategy?
A plan of attack. The initial phase is an encircling manoeuvre, thus!
John! Indians! Indians!
Let me in!
Now remember, the Indian is cunning...
- Hey--
- but not intelligent.
Therefore, we simply surround them and take them by surprise--
I'm frightfully sorry, old chaps.
It's all my fault.
- Aw, that's all right, Wildcat.
- Oh, we don't mind.
That's okay.
- How!
- Uh, h-how, Chief!
- How!
For many moons red man fight paleface Lost Boys.
- Ugh.
- Ugh, ugh.
- Sometime you win.
- Sometime we win.
- Okay, Chief.
Uh, you win this time.
Now, turn us loose.
""Turn us loose''?
You mean this is only a game?
Sure! When we win, we turn them loose.
- When they win, they turn us loose.
- They turn us loose.
This time, no turn 'em loose.
- Huh?
- Huh?
- The Chief's a great spoofer.
- Me no spoof'em.
Where you hide
Princess Tiger Lily?
- Uh, Tiger Lily?
- We ain't got your old princess.
- I've certainly never seen her.
- Me neither.
- Honest we don't.
- Heap big lie.
If Tiger Lily not back by sunset... burn 'em at stake.
Just imagine, real live mermaids.
- Would you like to meet 'em?
- Oh, Peter, I'd love to.
All right, come on.
- It's Peter.
- Oh!
- Hello, Peter!
- Hello, Peter!
- Hello, Peter!
- Hello!
Hello, Peter!
- Hello, girls.
- I'm so glad to see you.
Why did you stay away so long?
Did you miss me?
- Tell us one of your adventures.
- Something exciting.
Want to hear about the time
I cut off Hook's hand and threw it to the crocodile?
- Oh, I've always liked that one.
- Me too.
Well, there I was on
Marooner's Rock surrounded...
- Oh, Peter!
- by 40 or 50 pirates.
- Who's she?
Huh? Her?
Oh, that's Wendy.
- A girl?
- What's she doing here?
And in her nightdress too.
Come on, dearie.
Join us for a swim.
- Oh, please, I'm not dressed for it.
- Oh, but you must!
- We insist!
- No, no, please!
- Too good for us, eh?
- Peter!
- If you dare to come near me again--
- Wendy! Wendy!
They were just having a little fun, weren't you, girls?
- That's all.
- We were only trying to drown her.
- Ya see?
- Well, if you think for one minute...
- that I'm going to put up with a--
- Shh. Hold it, Wendy.
- Yep, it's Hook, all right.
- Hook!
- Hook!
Hook! Oh!
Quick, Wendy.
They've captured Tiger Lily.
Looks like they're headin' for Skull Rock.
Come on, Wendy.
Let's see what they're up to.
Now, me dear Princess, this is me proposition.
You tell me the hiding place of Peter Pan... and I shall set you free.
- You dog.
- Poor Tiger Lily.
Am I not a man of me word, Mr Smee?
Oh, yes, always, Captain.
You'd better talk, me dear, for soon the tide will be in... and then it will be too late.
- I'll show the old codfish.
Stay here, Wendy, and watch the fun.
- ""Fun''?
Remember... there is no path through water... to the happy hunting ground.
This is your last chance,
Tiger Lily!
Manatoa, great spirit of mighty seawater, speak!
Beware, Captain Hook!
Beware! Beware!
- Did you hear that, Smee?
- It's an evil spirit, Captain.
Stand by, Smee, while I take a look around.
Spirit of the great seawater, is it?
Psst! Wendy. Watch this.
- Mr Smee!
- Uh, yes, Captain?
Release the princess and take her back to her people.
Aye, aye, sir.
Release the princess--
- But-- But, Captain--
- Those are me orders, Mr Smee!
Aye, aye, sir.
- Well, at last Captain Hook's comin' to his senses.
- Odd's fish!
I told him all along you Indians wouldn't betray Peter Pan.
And just what do you think you are doing, Mr Smee?
Just what you told me, Captain.
Carryin' out your orders.
- My orders?
- Why, yes, Captain.
Didn't you just say to go--
Put her back!
You blithering idiot!
- My orders. Of all the bumbling--
- Mr Smee!
Just exactly what do you think you are doing?
Putting her back like you said, Captain.
I said nothing of the sort!
Oh, but, C-Captain, d-d-didn't you?
I thought that--
For the last time, Mr Smee.
Take the princess back to her people.
Understand? Understand?
Understand? Understand?
- Uh, aye, aye, sir.
- Oh, and one more thing.
When you return to the ship, tell the whole crew... to help themselves to me best rum.
- Peter!
- Here's your spirit, Smee!
Why, it's Peter Pan.
- Scurvy brat!
- Thank you, Captain.
Come down, boy, if you've a taste for cold steel.
- Watch this, Wendy.
- Oh, Peter, do be careful.
- Try your luck, Mr Smee?
- Let him have it!
Well, come on, you idiot!
Blast him!
Right here, Mr Smee.
Hold it, you fool!
No! No!
Captain?
Oh, how dreadful.
What a pity, Mr Smee.
I'm afraid we've lost the dear Captain.
Captain!
In the back, Captain?
Give it to him, Captain!
Cleave him to the brisket.
I've got you this time, Pan.
Well, well, a codfish on a hook.
I'll get you for this, Pan, if it's the last thing I do!
I say, Captain, do you hear something?
No.
No!
No!
Mr Crocodile, do you like codfish?
- You do?
- Oh, Peter, no!
No!
- Smee!
- D-Don't go away, Captain!
Uh, stay right there now, sir.
I'll save ya, sir.
Smee!
Smee!
Smee!
Ow!
Captain! Captain!
Smee! Smee!
- Give him back!
- Smee--
Row for the ship!
Row for the ship--
Whoa!
Smee!
Peter, what about Tiger Lily?
Tiger Lily?
Oh, Tiger Lily.
Help--
Peter. Wait for me.
That cursed Peter Pan.
Making a fool out of me.
Oh, my head.
Oh, a pirate's life is a wonderful life
- Your hot water, Mr Smee.
- Shh!
The poor Captain has a splitting headache.
We mustn't annoy him.
Well, Captain, it's nice to see you smiling again.
Brings back the good old days when we was leadin' a healthy, normal life.
Scuttlin' ships, cuttin' throats.
Oh, Captain... why don't we put to sea again?
You know, there's trouble brewin' on the island.
Women trouble.
I wouldn't want this to go any farther, but... the cook told me that the first mate told him... that he heard that Pan has banished Tinker Bell.
Whoa!
Why, you doddering imbecile, I--
Did you say Pan... has banished Tinker Bell?
Aye, aye, Captain.
That he has.
- But why?
- Well, on account of Wendy, Captain.
Tink tried to do her in, she did.
Tink's terrible jealous.
- Well, well.
- That's why we ought to leave, Captain.
This ain't no place for a respectable pirate.
That's it, Smee!
That's it!
I'm glad you agrees, Captain.
Quick, me coat.
Me best dress coat.
Aye, aye, sir. The sooner we get going, the better.
Ah, yes, a jealous female can be tricked into anything.
- My case of hooks!
- Aye, aye, sir.
Here you are, sir.
Your Sunday set, sir.
If we impress the pixie, convince her we're eager to help her... the wench may chart our course to a... certain hiding place.
Our best hiding place is the Spanish main, sir.
I'll set our course--
And where do you think you are going?
T-To tell the boys we sails with the tide, sir.
You will go ashore, pick up Tinker Bell... and bring her to me.
Understand?
Aye, aye, s-s-s-sir.
- How!
- How!
What's the Chief doing,John?
He's delivering an oration in sign language.
- What's he saying?
- He says...
""Peter Pan, mighty warrior.
""Save Tiger Lily.
Make big Chief heap glad.''
Well, he certainly doesn't look ""heap glad.''
Make Peter Pan heap big chief.
You now Little Flying Eagle.
- Hurray for Flying Eagle! Flying Eagle!
- Hurray!
Hurray!
- Oh, how wonderful!
- Hurray!
Teach 'em paleface brother all about red man.
Good, this should be most enlightening.
Uh, what makes the red man red?
- When did he first say, ""Ugh''?
- First say, ""Ugh''?
Why does he ask you, ""How''?
""Why does he ask you, 'How'?''
Hana mana ganda
Why does he ask you, how
Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda
Once the Injun didn't know all the things that he know now
But the Injun

Hana means what mana means and ganda means that too
Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda

Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda
Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda

Squaw, get 'em firewood.

In the Injun book, it say when first brave married squaw
He gave out with heap big ""ugh'" when he saw his mother-in-law
Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda

Let's go back a million years to the very first Injun prince
He kissed a maid and start to blush and we've all been blushin'since
Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda
Hana mana ganda
Now you've got it right from the head man
The real true story of the red man
No matter what's been written or said, no matter what
Now you know why the red man's red
- Wa-hoo!
-John!
Squaw take 'em papoose.
Wa-hoo!
- Michael!
- Squaw, get 'em firewood.
Squaw no get 'em firewood!
Squaw go home.
Beggin' your pardon, Miss Bell... but Captain Hook would like a word with ya.
Yes, Miss Bell,
Captain Hook admits defeat.
Tomorrow I leave the island, never to return.
I'm glad to hear that, Captain.
I'll tell the crew and--
And that's why I asked you over, me dear... to tell Peter
I bear him no ill will.
Oh, Pan has his faults, to be sure.
Uh, bringing that Wendy to the island, for instance.
Dangerous business, that.
Why, rumour has it that already she has come between you and Peter.
But what's this?
Tears?
Then it is true.
Oh, Smee.
The way of a man with a maid.
Taking the best years of her life and then... casting her aside like an old glove!
Ain't it a bloomin' shame?
But we mustn't judge
Peter too harshly, me dear.
It's that Wendy who's to blame.
Mr Smee, we must save the lad from himself.
But how?
We've so little time.
We sail in the morning.
Sail! That's it, Smee!
- We'll shanghai Wendy.
- ""Shanghai Wendy,'' Captain?
Take her to sea with us.
With her gone, Peter will soon forget this mad infatuation.
Come, Smee, we must leave immediately.
Surround Peter's home--
But, Captain, we-- we don't know where Peter Pan lives!
Great Scott, you're right, Smee!
What's that, my dear?
You could show us the way?
Why, I never thought of that.
- Take this down, Smee.
- ""Take this down, Smee.''
Aye, aye, Captain.
- Start at Pegleg Point.
- ""Start at Pegleg Point.''
- Forty paces west of Blindman's Bluff.
- ""Blindman's Bluff.''
Yes, yes. Hop, skip and a jump across Crocodile Creek.
Then north by northeast, one, two, three.
Well, get on with it--
Continue, my dear.
I mustn't harm Peter?
Madam, Captain Hook gives his word... not to lay a finger... or a hook on Peter Pan.
Ah, Hangman's Tree.
So that's the entrance to his hiding place.
Thank you, me dear.
You've been most helpful.

Big Chief Flying Eagle greets his braves.
- How!
- Uh, how, Chief.
- How, Chief! How!
- How.
- How.
Big Chief greets Little Mother.
- How!
- Ugh!
Aw, Wendy, is that all you have to say?
- Everyone else thinks I'm wonderful.
- Especially Tiger Lily.
- Tiger Lily?
-John! Michael!
Take off that war paint and get ready for bed.
- Bed?
- Brave no sleep.
Go for days without sleep.
- But, boys, we're going home in the morning.
- Home!
- And--
- Oh, Wendy, we don't want to go home.
No go home. Stay many moons.
Have heap big time.
Now, Peter, let's stop pretending and be practical.
Chief Flying Eagle has spoken.
Oh, for goodness sake.
Please, boys.
Do you want to stay here and grow up like-- like savages?
- Of course.
- But you can't.
You need a mother.
We all do.
Aren't you our mother, Wendy?
Why, Michael, of course not!
Surely you haven't forgotten our real mother!
Did she have silky ears and wear a fur coat?
Oh, no, Michael.
That was Nana.
I think I had a mother once.
- What was she like?
- What was she like?
- I forget.
- I had a white rat!
- That's no mother!
Hey, who ya shovin'?
No, no, boys! Please.
I'll tell you what a mother is.
- Yeah, tell us.
- Yeah, tell us.
- Please, Wendy.
Well, a mother, a real mother... is the most wonderful person in the world.
She's the angel voice... that bids you good night... kisses your cheek... whispers, ""Sleep tight.''
Your mother
And mine
Your mother
And mine
The helping hand that guides you along
Whether you're right
Whether you're wrong
Your mother
And mine
Your mother
And mine
What makes mothers all that they are
Might as well ask what makes a star
Ask your heart to tell you her worth
Your heart will say
Heaven on earth
- Another word
- Shh.
For divine
Your mother
And mine
- I wanna see my mother.
- Yes, Michael.
I propose we leave for home at once.
- Could I go too? Huh, Wendy?
- Me too, Wendy!
- Come on! Let me go!
All right, boys. All right. I'm sure
Mother would be glad to have you.
Uh, that is, if Peter doesn't mind.
Go on!
Go back and grow up!
But I'm warning ya.
Once you're grown up... you can never come back!
- Never!
- Dear.
- Well, then, shall we be off?
- Yeah, come on. Let's go!
- Yeah!
- See ya, Peter.
They'll be back.
Peter.
Goodbye, Peter.
All right, men.
Take them away.
And now, Smee, to take care of Master Peter Pan.
But, Captain, wouldn't it be more humane-like to slit his throat?
Aye, that it would, Mr Smee.
But I have given me word not to lay a finger... or a hook on Peter Pan.
And Captain Hook never breaks a promise.
Yo ho, yo ho
Yo ho, yo ho, yo ho
So try the life of a thief

Join up with Captain Hook
- Hey, I wanna join!
- Please! Oh, boy!
- I wanna be a pirate!
- Oh, boy! A pirate!
Boys! Aren't you ashamed of yourselves?
But Captain Hook is most insistent, Wendy.
Yeah! He says we'll walk the plank if we don't.
Oh, no, we won't.
Peter Pan will save us.
Peter Pan will save them, Smee.
Peter Pan will save them.
Oh, Captain, you did it.
But a thousand pardons, my dear.
I don't believe you are in on our little joke.
You see, we left a present for Peter.
Sort of a surprise package, you might say.
Why, I can see our little friend at this very moment... reading the tender inscription.
""To Peter, with love from Wendy.
Do not open till 6 o'clock.''
Huh. I wonder what's in it.
Could he but see within the package... he would find an ingenious little device.
Set, so that when the clock is like this...
Peter Pan will be blasted... out of Never Land forever.
No!
But time grows short.
We have but 1 8 seconds.
Fifteen seconds.
Thirteen seconds.
Twelve seconds.
Well, I guess
I can open it now.
Hey, Tink.
Look what Wendy left.
Hey, stop that! Stop it!
What's the matter with you?
Hook? A bomb?
Don't be ridiculous!
And so passeth a worthy opponent.
Amen.
Hook! It was a bomb!
Why, if it hadn't been for Tink-- Tinker Bell!
Tink? Tinker Bell?
Where are you, Tink?
Tink? Tinker Bell!
Tink. Are you all right?
Wendy? The boys?
But I've gotta save you first.
Hold on, Tink! Hold on!
Don't go out.
Don't you understand, Tink?
You mean more to me than anything in this whole world!
And now, which will it be?
The pen or the plank?
Captain Hook, we will never join your crew.
As you wish.
Ladies first, my dear.
- Goodbye, boys.
- Goodbye, Wendy.
- Goodbye, Wendy.
- Be brave,John.
- I shall strive to, Wendy.
- Goodbye, Michael.
- Goodbye, Wendy.
- Come on!
- Get along over there!
- Get going, miss. Get going!
Don't give us no trouble!
Go on! Go on!
Get it over with!
- Move along!
- The Captain's waitin'!
Wendy! Wendy!
- Captain, n-no splash.
- Not a sound.
- Not a bloomin' ripple.
- It's a jinx, that's what it is.
- No splash.
- No sign of the wench.
- Did you hear a splash?
- I'm telling you, mates, it's a black day.
Mark me words.
We'll all pay for this.
The ship is bewitched.
No splash, Captain.
So, you want a splash, Mr Starkey.
I'll give you a splash!
- Who's next?
- You're next, Hook!
- This time you've gone too far!
- It's Pan! Peter Pan!
- And Wendy!
- It can't be!
It's his blinkin' ghost what's talkin'!
Say your prayers, Hook.
I'll show you this ghost has blood in his veins.
I'll run him through! Ooh!
Take that!
Curse this hook!
Come on, everybody!
Hurry, Michael! Hurry!
Don't stand there, you bilge rats!
Get those scurvy brats!
After the brats, men!
This is no mere boy.
'Tis some fiend fighting me.
A flying devil!
- Hold your fire.
- Get 'em!
Steady, men. Steady.
- Club 'em with the marline.
- Fire!
- I'll crack their bloomin' skulls!
- Let me at 'em!
Down, you blackguard!
Hurray!
- Right through, Michael.
- Yea, Bear Killer!
- Yea for Bear Killer!
Fly! Fly! Fly! You coward!
Coward? Me?
Ha-ha-ha! You wouldn't dare fight old Hook man-to-man!
You'd fly away like a cowardly sparrow!
Nobody calls Pan a coward and lives!
I'll fight you man-to-man, with one hand behind my back.
- You mean you won't fly?
- No, don't, Peter! It's a trick!
- I give my word, Hook.
- Good, then let's have at it!
Now! Insolent youth, prepare to die!
Fly! Fly, Peter! Fly!
No! I gave my word.
You're mine, Hook!
Cleave him to the brisket!
You wouldn't do old Hook in now, would you, lad?
I'll go away forever.
I'll do anything you say.
Well, all right.
If ya say you're a codfish.
- I'm a codfish.
- Louder!
- I'm a codfish!
- Hurray!
Hook is a codfish
A codfish, a codfish
-Hook is a codfish, a codfish, a codfish
-All right, Hook... you're free to go, and never return.
Peter!
Smee! Smee!
Smee!
Smee! Smee!
Smee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee!
Captain!
Captain! Captain!
Hurray!
Hurray for Captain Pan!
All right, ya swabs, aloft with ya!
We're castin' off!
Heave those halyards!
But, but, Peter--
Oh, that is, Captain Pan.
- At your service, madam.
- Could you tell me, sir, where we're sailing?
- To London, madam.
- Oh, Peter.
Michael!John!
We're going home!
Man the capstan!
Hoist anchor!
Pixie dust!
George, I am so glad you changed your mind about Wendy.
After all, she's still a child.
Oh, pshaw, Mary.
You know I never mean those things.
Do I, Nana?
Oh! Wendy!
Wendy, what on earth are you doing there?
Mmm. Hmm?
- Oh, Mother, we're back!
- Back?
All except the Lost Boys.
They weren't quite ready.
- Lost Bo-- Ready?
- To grow up.
That's why they went back to Never Land.
- Never Land?
- Yes, but I am.
- Uh, ""am''?
- Uh, ready to grow up.
Oh! Oh! Uh--
Well, my dear, all in good time.
- After all, perhaps we were too--
- Oh, but, Mother... it was such a wonderful adventure.
Tinker Bell and the mermaids and Peter Pan.
Oh, he was the most wonderful of all.
- Why, why, even when we were kidnapped, I--
- Kidnapped!
Mm-hmm. I knew Peter Pan would save us, and he did.
And we all called him a codfish!
Uh, Captain Hook, I mean.
And then we sailed away on a ship in the sky.
Hmm. Mary, I'm going to bed.
Oh, Mother.
He really is wonderful, isn't he?
See how well he sails the ship.
- George. George!
- Now what, Mary?
Nana, d-did you see--
You know, I have the strangest feeling... that I've seen that ship before.
A long time ago... when I was very young.
- George, dear.
- Father.
When there's a smile in your heart
There's no better time to start
Think of all thejoy you'll find
When you leave the world behind
And bid your cares goodbye
You can fly
You can fly
You can fly
Alice in Wonderland
How do you get to Wonderland
Over the hill or under land
Orjust behind the tree
When clouds go rolling by
They roll away and leave the sky
Where is the land beyond the eye
That people cannot see
Where can it be
Where do stars go
Where is the grass that blooms
They must be somewhere
Where is the sunny afternoon
Alice in Wonderland
Where is the path to Wonderland
Over the hill or here or there
I wonder
Where
"... for if he does and had been of late...
"much accustomed to usurpation and conquest.
"Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him, and even Stigand-"
- Alice.
- Hmm?
- Oh, I'm listening.
- "And even Stigand,
"the Archbishop of Canterbury, agreed to meet with William... and offer him the Crown. "
"William's conduct at first was model-"
Alice. Will you kindly pay attention to your history lesson?
I'm sorry, but how can one possibly pay attention... to a book with no pictures in it?
My dear child, there are a great many good books in this world without pictures.
In this world, perhaps, but in my world, the books would be nothing but pictures.
Your world? Huh!
What nonsense.
- Now, once more.
- Nonsense?
- From the beginning.
- That's it, Dinah.
If I had a world of my own, everything would be nonsense.
Nothing would be what it is, because everything would be what it isn't, and contrariwise, what it is, it wouldn't be.
And what it wouldn't be, it would.
You see?
In my world, you wouldn't say "meow. "
You'd say,
"Yes, Miss Alice. "
Oh, but you would. You'd be just like people, Dinah.
And all the other animals too.
Why, in my world:
Cats and rabbits
Would reside in fancy little houses
And be dressed in shoes and hats and trousers
In a world of my own
All the flowers
Would have very extra-special powers
They would sit and talk to me
For hours, when I'm lonely
In a world of my own
There'd be new birds
Lots of nice and friendly how-de-do birds
Everyone would have a dozen bluebirds
Within that world
Of my own
I could listen
To a babbling brook
And hear a song that
I could understand
I keep wishing
It could be that way
Because my world would be
A wonderland.
Oh, Dinah. It's just a rabbit with a waistcoat- and a watch!
Oh, my fur and whiskers!
I'm late, I'm late, I'm late!
Now this is curious. What could a rabbit possibly be late for?
- Please, sir!
- I'm late, I'm late
For a very important date
No time to say hello, Goodbye
- I'm late, I'm late, I'm late
- It must be awfully important.
Like a party or something.
Mr Rabbit! Wait!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
I'm overdue
I'm really in a stew No time to say goodbye, Hello I'm late, I'm late, I'm late
My. What a peculiar place to have a party.
You know, Dinah, we really shouldn't... um- be doing this.
After all, we haven't been invited, and curiosity often leads to trouble.
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
Goodbye, Dinah.
Goodbye!
Oh.
Well, after this, I shall think nothing of fall-
Oh. Of falling down stairs.
Oh!
Ahh.
Whoa!
Goodness. What if I should fall right through... the centre of the earth-
Oh! And come out the other side... where people walk upside down?
Oh, but that's silly.
Nobody- Oh!
Oh, Mr Rabbit! Wait!
Please!
Curiouser and curiouser!
- Ohh!
- Oh! Oh, I beg your pardon.
Whew. Ha. It's quite all right, but you did give me quite a turn.
- You see, I was following-
- Rather good, what? Doorknob? Turn?
- Please, sir.
- Swell, huh?
One good turn deserves another.
What can I do for you?
Well, I'm looking for a white rabbit, so, um, if you don't mind-
Eh? Oh!
- There he is! I simply must get through.
- Sorry. You're much too big.
- Simple impassable.
- You mean impossible.
No, impassable.
Nothing's impossible.
- Why don't you try the bottle on the table?
- Table? Oh!
Read the directions and directly you'll be directed in the right direction.
"Drink me. "
Hmm. Better look first, for if one drinks much... from a bottle marked "poison," it's almost certain to disagree with one sooner or later.
- Beg your pardon?
- I was just giving myself some good advice.
But- Mmm.
Tastes like, uh, cherry tart.
Custard, pineapple, roast turkey. Goodness!
- What did I do?
- Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho.
You almost went out like a candle.
But look!
I'm just the right size.
Oh, no use.
I forgot to tell you.
I'm locked!
Oh, no!
Uh, but of course, uh, you've got the key, so-
- What key?
- Now don't tell me you've left it up there.
Oh, dear.
- Whatever will I do?
- Try the box, naturally.
Oh!
"Eat me. " All right, but goodness knows what this will do.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, oh!
What did you say?
I said, "A little of that went a long way. "
Well, I don't think it's so funny.
Now- Now I shall n- never get home!
Oh, come, come, now.
Crying won't help.
I know, but I-I-
I just can't-
I can't stop!
Come! Oh! Say, this won't do.
It won't do at all.
You! You up there!
Stop!
I say! Oh, look!
The bottle. The bottle!
Oh, dear. I do wish
I hadn't cried so much.
Oh, a sailor's life is the life for me
How I love to sail on the bounding sea
And I never, never, ever do a thing about the weather
For the weather never, ever does a thing for me
Oh, a sailor's life is the life for me
Tiddlee um pom pom
Deedle dum dum dee
And I never, ev-
Ahoy!
And other nautical expressions!
Land ho, by Jove!
- Where away, Dodo?
- Dodo?
Three points to starboard.
Pull away, me hearties.
Have you in port in no time at all.
- Oh, yo-ho-ho and a bottle of sea
- Uh, Mr Dodo! Please!
- We'll all fish fry as we sail the sea
- Please help me!
Um, uh, uh, pardon me, but, uh, would you mind helping me, please?
Yoo-hoo. Yoo-hoo!
Help me. Please!
Won't you-
Help me!
Forward, backward, inward, outward
Come and join the chase
Nothing could be drier than a jolly caucus race
Backward, forward, outward, inward bottom to the top
Never a beginning
There can never be a stop
Hopping, skipping, hopping, skipping
Fancy-free and gay
That's all they did tomorrow but you finished yesterday
Round and round and round we go until forevermore
Once we were behind but now we find we are be-
Forward, backward, inward, outward
Come and join the chase
Nothing could be drier than a jolly caucus race
Ah, backward-
I say! You'll never get dry that way.
- Get dry?
- Have to run with the others.
First rule of a caucus race, you know.
But how can I-
That's better. Have you dry in no time now.
No one can ever get dry this way.
Nonsense! Why, I'm as dry as a bone already.
- Yes, but-
- All right, chaps. Let's have it now.
Look lively.
The White Rabbit.
Mr Rabbit. M-Mr Rabbit-
- Oh, my goodness! I'm late. I'm late.
- Oh-oh, don't go away.
- I'll be right back.
- I'm late, I'm late.
- I'm late, I'm late. - Don't step on the fish! Uh, w-w-watch it there.
Stop kicking that mackerel.
Brilliant!Jolly well-
Mr Rabbit.
Oh, Mr Rabbit.
Oh, dear, I'm sure he came this way.
Do you suppose he could be hiding?
Hmm.
Not here.
I wonder.
No, I suppose he must've-
Oh! Why, what peculiar little figures.
Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum.
If you think we're waxworks, you ought to pay, you know.
Contrary to wax, if you think we're alive, you ought to speak to us.
- That's logic.
- Well, it's been nice meeting you.
Goodbye.
You're beginning backwards.
Aye, the first thing in a visit is to say:
How do you do and shake hands
Shake hands, shake hands
How do you do and shake hands and state your name and business
- That's manners.
- Really?
Well, my name is Alice, and I'm following a white rabbit, so-
- No, you can't go yet.
- No, the visit has just started.
- I'm very sorry.
- Would you like to play hide-and-seek?
- Or "Button, button, who's got the button"?
- No, thank you.
If you stay long enough, we might have a battle.
That's very kind of you, but I must be going.
- Why?
- Because I'm following a white rabbit.
- Why? - Well, I-I'm curious to know where he's going.
Oh, she's curious.
The oysters were curious, too, weren't they?
Aye, and you remember what happened to them.
- Poor things.
- Poor things.
Why? What did happen to the oysters?
- Oh, you wouldn't be interested.
- Oh, but I am.
No, no, you're in much too much of a hurry.
- Well, perhaps I could spare a little time.
- You could?
Well!
"The Walrus and the Carpenter. "
Or "The Story of the Curious Oysters. "
The sun was shining on the sea
Shining with all its might
He did his very best to make the billows smooth and bright
And this was odd because it was
The middle of the night
The walrus and the carpenter
Were walking close at hand
The beach was wide from side to side
But much too full of sand
Mr Walrus said the carpenter
My brain begins to perk
We'll sweep this clear in half a year
If you don't mind the work
Work!
- Th-The time has come
- The walrus said
To talk of other things.:
Of shoes and ships and sealing wax
And cabbages and kings
And why the sea is boiling hot and whether pigs have wings
Calloo, callay
No work today
We're cabbages and kings
Oh, uh, oysters, come out and walk with us.
The day is warm and bright.
A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk, would be a sheer delight.
Yes, and should we get hungry on the way, we'll stop and, uh, have a bite.
But Mother Oyster winked her eye
And shook her heavy head
She knew too well this was no time
To leave her oyster bed
The sea is nice
Take my advice
- And stay right here
- Mum said
Yes, yes, of course, of course, but, uh, ha-ha!
The time has come my little friends
To talk of other things
Of shoes and ships and sealing wax of cabbages and kings
And why the sea is boiling hot and, uh, whether pigs have wings
Calloo, callay
Come run away
With cabbages and kings
Well, now, uh, let me see.
Ah! A loaf of bread is what we chiefly need.
Listen, how 'bout some pepper and salt and vinegar, eh?
Well, yes, yes. Splendid idea.
Ha-ha. Very good indeed.
Now, if you're ready, oysters, dear, we can begin the feed.
- Feed?
- Oh, yes. Uh-
The time has come my little friends to talk of food and things
Of peppercorns and mustard seed and other seasonings
We'll mix 'em all together in a sauce that's fit for kings
Calloo, callay
We'll eat today
Like cabbages and kings
I, uh- I-I weep for you.
I- Oh, excuse me.
I deeply sympathize.
For I've enjoyed your company... oh, much more than you realize.
Little oysters.
Little oysters.
But answer there came none
And this was scarcely odd because
They'd been eaten, every one
Well, uh-
The time has come!
With cabbages
And kings
- The end.
- That was a very sad story.
Aye, and there's a moral to it.
Oh, yes, a very good moral, if you happen to be an oyster.
- Well, it's been a very nice visit-
- Another recitation.
- I'm sorry, but-
- Entitled "Father William. "
- But really, I'm-
- First verse.
You are old, Father William the young man said
And your hair has become very white
And yet you incessantly stand on your head
Do you think at your age it is right, it's right
Do you think at your age it is right
Well, in me youth
Father William replied to his son
I'd do it again and again and again
And I've done it again and again and again
I wonder who lives here.
Mary Ann! Oh, drat that girl.
Where could she have put them?
- Mary Ann!
- The rabbit!
Mary Ann!
No use! Can't wait! I'm awfully late.
Oh, me. Oh, my. Oh, me. Oh, my.
Excuse me, sir, but- but I've been trying to-
Why, Mary Ann!
What are you doing out here?
- Mary Ann?
- Don't just do something. Stand there. No, no! Go, go!
- Go get my gloves. I'm late!
- But late for what?
- That's just what I-
- My gloves!
- At once! Do you hear?
- Goodness.
I suppose I'll be taking orders from Dinah next.
Hmm. Now let me see.
If I were a rabbit, where would I keep my gloves?
Oh! Thank you.
Don't mind if I do.
Oh, no, no, not again.
Oh! Mary Ann!
Now you see here,
Mary Ann. Help!
I need help!
Whoo-hoo! Ha! Oh!
No! Help!
Monster! Help! Assistance!
- Oh, dear.
- A monster! A monster, Dodo!
- In my house, Dodo. Oh, my poor little-bitty house. - The dodo.
Steady. Steady, old chap. Can't be as bad as all that, you know.
Oh, my poor roof and rafters.
All my walls and- There it is!
By Jove!
Jolly well is, isn't it?
Well, do something, Doo-doo.
Yes, indeed. An extraordinary situation, but, uh-
But, but, but, but, but what?
But I have a very simple solution.
- Thank goodness.
- W-W-W-What is it?
- Simply pull it out the chimney.
- Yes, g-g-go on, go on. Pull it out.
Who, me?
Don't be ridiculous.
What we need is a- Uh-
- A lizard with a ladder!
- Hmm? Oh! Bill!
Bill! We need a lazard with a lidder- A lidder- A b-b-b-
- Can you help us?
- At your service, governor.
Bill, me lad, have you ever been down a chimney?
Why, governor, I've been down more chimneys-
Excellent, excellent.
You just pop down the chimney... and haul that monster out of there.
Righto, governor.
Monster?
Steady now. There.
That's better.
Bill, lad, you're passing up a golden opportunity.
- I am?
- You can be famous.
- I can?
- Of course!
There's a brave lad.
In you go now.
Nothing to it, old boy.
Simply tie your tail... around the monster's neck and drag it out.
- B-But-But, governor-
- Good luck, Bill.
Well, there goes Bill.
- Poor Bill.
- Uh, perhaps we should try a- a more energetic remedy.
Yes! Anything, anything.
But hurry!
Oh, I-I propose that we, uh-
- Yes, go on, go on. Yes, yes.
- I propose we, uh-
Oh!
By Jove! That's it.
We'll burn the house down.
Yes. Burn the house- What?
- Oh, no.
- Oh-ho-ho!
Oh, we'll smoke the blighter out
We'll put the beast to rout
Some kindling
A stick or two
Ah, this bit of rubbish ought to do
- Oh, dear
- We'll smoke the blighter out
- We'll smoke the monster out
- No, no! Not my beautiful bird house!
Oh, we'll roast the blighter's toes
We'll toast the bounder's nose
Just fetch that gate
We'll make it clear
- That monsters aren't welcome here
- Oh, dear. Oh, me, oh, my.
- A match? Thank you.
- Match?
Without a single doubt we'll smoke the monster out
We'll smoke the monster out
No! No!
My poor house and furniture.
Oh, dear.
This is serious.
I simply must- Ah!
A garden.
Perhaps if I ate something, it would make me grow smaller.
Let go! Help!
- I'm sorry, but I must eat something.
- Not me! You, you, you, you-
You barbarian!
Help!
Monster!
Help!
Ah! I'm late! Oh, dear.
I'm here. I should be there.
- I'm late, I'm late, I'm late.
- I say, do you have a match?
Oh, no. Must go. Goodbye.
Hello. I'm late, I'm late, I'm late.
- Wait! Please wait!
- Ah, young lady.
- Do you have a match?
- No, I-I'm sorry, but-
- Mr Rabbit!
- No cooperation. No cooperation at all.
Well, can't have monsters about.
Jolly well have to carry on alone.
Wait! Please!
Just a minute!
Oh, dear. I'll never catch him while I'm this small.
Why, what curious butterflies.
You mean bread-and-butterflies.
Oh, yes, of course, uh- Hmm?
Now who do you suppose-
A horsefly! I mean, a- a rocking horsefly.
- Naturally.
- I beg your pardon, but, uh, did you-
Oh, that's nonsense.
Flowers can't talk.
But of course we can talk, my dear.
If there's anyone worth talking to.
Or about.
- And we sing too.
- You do?
Oh, yes. Would you like to hear
"Tell It to the Tulips"?
- No, let's sing about us.
- We know one about the shy little violets.
- Oh, no, not that old thing.
- Let's do "Lovely Lily of the Valley. "
- How 'bout a daisy duet? - Oh, she wouldn't like that. - Oh, watch the rose.
Girls! We shall sing
"Golden Afternoon. "
That's about all of us.
Sound your "A," Lily.
La
Mi, mi, mi, mi, mi, mi mi, mi, mi, mi, mi, mi
La, la, la, la la, la, la, la, la
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Dum du dum-dum
Little bread-and-butterflies kiss the tulips
And the sun is like a toy balloon
There are
Get-up-in-the-morning glories
In the golden afternoon
There are dizzy daffodils on the hillside
Strings of violets are all in tune
Tiger lilies love the dandelions
In the golden afternoon
The gold afternoon
There are dog- and cat-erpillars
And a copper centipede
Where the lazy daisies
Love the very
Peaceful life
They lead
You can learn a lot of things from the flowers
For especially in the month ofJune
Ah, ah, ah, ah
There's a wealth
Of happiness and romance
All in the golden
Afternoon
All in the golden afternoon
The golden afternoon
You can learn a lot of things from the flowers
For especially in the month ofJune
There's a wealth of happiness
And romance
All-
The golden afternoon
Ah
- Oh, that was lovely!
- Thank you, my dear.
What kind of garden do you come from?
Oh, I don't come from any garden.
Do you suppose she's a wild flower?
Oh, no.
I'm not a wild flower.
Just what specie- or shall we say genus- are you, my dear?
Well, I suppose you'd call me... a Genus Humanus Alice.
Ever see an Alice with a blossom like that?
Come to think of it, did you ever see an Alice?
Yes. And did you notice her petals?
What a peculiar colour.
And no fragrance.
Just look at those stems.
Rather scrawny, I'd say.
I think she's pretty.
- Quiet, bud.
- But I'm not a flower.
Aha!Just as I suspected.
She's nothing but a common
Mobile Vulgaris.
Oh, no!
- A common what?
- To put it bluntly:
- A weed.
- I'm not a weed.
- Well, you wouldn't expect her to admit it.
- Can you imagine?
- Well, goodness!
- Don't let her stay here and go to seed.
- Go on now. Don't you take root-
- Please, girls!
We don't want weeds in our bed.
Move along, move along.
All right, if that's the way you feel about it.
If I were my right size, I could pick every one of you if I wanted to.
And I guess that would teach you.
You can learn a lot of things from the flowers.
Hm! Seems to me they could learn a few things about manners.
A
E- I-O-U
A- E-I-O-U
A- E-I-O-U
Who
U- E-I-O-A
U- E-I-A
A- E-I-O-U
Who are you?
Well, I-I-I hardly know, sir.
I've changed so many times since this morning, you see-
I do not see.
Explain yourself.
I'm afraid I can't explain myself, sir, because I'm not myself, you know.
I do not know.
Well, I can't put it any more clearly, for it isn't clear to me.
You? Who are you?
Well, don't you think you ought to tell me... who you are first?
Why?
Oh, dear, everything is so confusing.
- It is not.
- Well, it is to me.
- Why? - Well, I can't remember things as I used to, and-
- Recite.
- Hmm?
Oh. Oh, oh, yes, sir. Um-
How doth the little busy bee improve each shin-
Stop.
That is not spoken correct-ically.
It goes:
How-
How doth the little crocodile... improve his shining tail... and pour the waters of the Nile... on every golden scale?
How cheer-
How cheer-
How cheerfully he seems to grin.
How neatly spreads his claws... and welcomes little fishes in... with gently smiling jaws.
Well, I must say I've never heard it that way before.
I know.
I have improved it.
Well- If you ask me-
You? Heh!
Who are you?
Oh!
Uh, you there. Girl!
Wait! Come back!
I have something important to say.
Oh, dear.
I wonder what he wants now.
Well?
Keep your temper.
- Is that all?
- No.
Exact-ically what is your problem?
Well, it's exact-ically- exact-ical-
Well, it's precisely this:
I should like to be a little larger, sir.
- Why?
- Well, after all, three inches is such a wretched height-
I am exact-ically three inches high!
And it is a very good height indeed!
But I'm not used to it, and you needn't... shout!
- Oh, dear.
- By the way, I have a few more helpful hints.
One side will make you grow taller.
- One side of what?
- And the other side will make you grow shorter.
- The other side of what?
- The mushroom, of course!
Hmm.
One side will make me grow-
But which is which?
Hmm. After all that's happened, I-
I wonder if I-
I don't care.
I'm tired of being only three inches high.
Yi, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi!
A serpent! Help!
Help! Serpent! Serpent!
Oh, but please, please!
Off with you! Shoo! Shoo!
Go away! Serpent! Serpent!
- But I'm not a serpent.
- Ser- Indeed?
- Then just what are you?
- I'm just a little girl.
Little? Ha! Little?
Well, I am.
I mean, I-I was.
And I suppose you don't eat eggs either.
- Yes, I do, but, but, but-
- Ah! I knew it! I knew it.
Serpent. Serpent!
Oh, for goodness' sake.
Hmm! And the other side will-
The very idea.
Spend all my time laying eggs for serpents like her.
Goodness. I wonder if I'll ever get the knack of it.
There. That's much better.
Hmm. Better save these.
Now let's see.
Where was I?
Hmm. I- I wonder which way I ought to go.
'Twas brillig
And the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe
All mimsy were the borogroves
And the mome raths outgrabe
Now where in the world do you suppose that-
- Lose something?
- Oh!
Oh, uh- I-
I was- N-No.
I- I-I mean, I-I was just wondering-
Oh, that's quite all right.
Uh, one moment, please.
Ooh.
Second chorus.
'Twas brillig
And the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe
Why- Why, you're a cat.
A Cheshire cat.
All mimsy
Were the borogroves
Oh, wait!
Don't go, please.
There you are.
Third chorus.
Oh, no, no, no.
Thank you, but-
But I just wanted to ask you which way I ought to go.
Well, that depends... on where you want to get to.
Oh, it really doesn't matter, as long as I-
Then it really doesn't matter... which way you go.
And the mome raths outgrabe
Oh, by the way.
If you'd really like to know, he went that way.
- Who did?
- The White Rabbit.
- He did?
- He did what?
- Went that way.
- Who did?
- The White Rabbit.
- What rabbit?
But didn't you just say-
I mean- Oh, dear.
Can you stand on your head?
- Oh!
- However, if I were looking for a white rabbit,
I'd ask the Mad Hatter.
The Mad Hatter? Um, no, no, I-I don't think-
Or there's the March Hare... in that direction.
Uh, thank you. I-I think
I shall visit him.
Of course, he's mad too.
Oh, but I don't want to go among mad people.
Oh, you can't help that.
Most everyone's mad here.
You may have noticed... that I'm not all there myself.
And the mome raths outgrabe
Goodness. If the people here are like that, I-
I must try not to upset them.
How very curious.
If there are no objections let it be unanimous
- Oh, a very merry unbirthday
- A very merry unbirthday
A very merry unbirthday to us
A very merry unbirthday to me
- To who - To me - Oh, you
A very merry unbirthday to you
- Who, me -
Yes, you - Oh, me
Let's all congratulate us with another cup of tea
A very merry unbirthday
To
You
- No room, no room, no room.
- No vacancy.
- No room, no room, no room!
- But I thought there was plenty of room.
Ah, but it's very rude to sit down without being invited.
I'll say it's rude.
It's very, very rude indeed.
Very, very, very rude indeed.
Oh, I'm very sorry, but I did enjoy your singing, and I wondered if you could tell me-
You enjoyed our singing?
Oh, what a delightful child.
Things happen. I'm so excited!
We never get compliments.
- You must have a cup of tea.
- Ah, yes, indeed, the tea.
- You must have a cup of tea.
- That would be very nice.
I'm sorry I interrupted your birthday party.
- Uh-uh, thank you.
- Birthday? Ha-ha-ha.
My dear child, this is not a birthday party.
Of course not.
This is an unbirthday party.
Unbirthday? Oh, I'm sorry, but I don't quite understand.
It's very simple.
Now, 30 days hath Sept-
No. Well. An unbirthday-
If you have a birthday, then, you-
- She doesn't know what an unbirthday is.
- How silly!
Well, I-
I shall elucidate.
Now statistics prove prove that you've one birthday
Imagine.:just one birthday every year
Ah, but there are
364 unbirthdays
Precisely why we're gathered here to cheer
Why, then, today is my unbirthday too.
- It is?
- What a small world this is.
In that case-
- A very merry unbirthday
- To me
- To you
- A very merry unbirthday
- For me
- For you
Now blow the candle out, my dear and make your wish come true
A very merry unbirthday
To you
Twinkle, twinkle, little bat,
How I wonder what you're at.
Up above the world you fly...
Like a tea-tray in the sky.
- Oh, that was lovely.
- And, uh, and now, my dear, uh, you were saying that you would like to seek-
Pardon me.
Uh, you were seeking, uh, some information of some kind?
Oh, yes. You see,
I'm looking for a-
Clean cup, clean cup.
Move down!
- But I haven't used my cup.
- Drink up, drink up
Move down, move down
Drink up, drink up, move down
Would you like a little more tea?
Well, I haven't had any yet, so I can't very well take more.
Ah, you mean you can't very well take less.
Yes. You can always take more than nothing.
- But I only meant that-
- And now, my dear, something, uh, seems to be troubling you.
Uh, won't you tell us all about it?
- Start at the beginning.
- Yes, yes.
And when you come to the end, stop, see?
Well, it all started... while I was sitting on the riverbank with Dinah.
Very interesting.
- Who's Dinah?
- Why, Dinah's my cat. You see-
Ah! Cat?
- Get the jam. On his nose. Put it on his nose.
- On his nose, on his nose.
- C-C-Cat.
- Oh. Oh.
My goodness. Those are the things that upset me.
See all the trouble you've started?
- But really, I didn't think that-
- Ah, but that's the point.
- If you don't think, you shouldn't talk.
- Clean cup, clean cup.
Move down, move down, move down!
- But I still haven't used-
- Move down, move down, move down
Move down
And now, my dear, as you were saying?
Oh, yes. I was sitting on the riverbank with, uh, with you-know-who.
I do?
I mean my c-a-t.
Tea?
Just half a cup, if you don't mind.
Come, come, my dear.
Don't you care for tea?
Why, yes, I'm very fond of tea, but-
If you don't care for tea, you could at least make polite conversation.
Well, I've been trying to ask you-
I have an excellent idea.
Let's change the subject.
Why is a raven like a writing desk?
Riddles?
Let me see now.
Why is a raven like a writing desk?
- I beg your pardon?
- Why is a raven like a writing desk?
- Why is a what?
- Careful. She's stark, ravin' mad.
But, but it's your silly riddle.
You just said-
- Steady. Don't get excited.
- How about a nice cup of tea?
Have a cup of tea, indeed. Well,
I'm sorry, but I just haven't the time.
The time! The time!
Who's got the time?
No, no, no, no. No time, no time, no time.
Hello. Goodbye.
I'm late. I'm late.
- The White Rabbit!
- Oh, I'm so late.
I'm so very, very late.
Well, no wonder you're late. Why, this clock is exactly two days slow.
- Two days slow?
- Course you're late.
My goodness.
We'll have to look into this. Aha!
I see what's wrong with this.
Why, this watch is full of wheels.
Oh, my poor watch.
Oh, my wheels and springs.
- But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but- - Butter! Of course!
It needs some butter.
Butter!
- Butter!
- But-but-butter?
Butter. Oh, thank you.
Butter. Yes, that's fine.
Oh, no, no! No, no, no!
You'll get crumbs in it.
Oh, this is the very best butter.
What are you talking about?
- Tea?
- Tea! Oh, I never thought of tea! Of course.
- Don't! Don't! Not tea!
- Tea.
- Sugar?
- Sugar? Two spoons. Yes, y- Two spoons.
- Thank you, yes.
- Oh, please be careful!
- Jam?
- Jam! I forgot all about the jam.
- No! Not jam!
- Just shows you what a person'll do.
- Mustard?
- Mustard, yes! Mus-
Mustard?
Don't let's be silly.
Lemon- that's different.
That's- There.
That should do it.
- Look at that. - It's going mad. - Oh, my goodness.
- Oh, dear. - It's going mad.
Mad watch. - Oh, my goodness.
- I can't understand it. It was the best butter.
- Mad watch. Mad watch.
- Mad watch! - Oh, look. Do you think the springs- Oh, my goodness!
There's only one way to stop a mad watch.
Two days slow.
That's what it is.
- Oh, my watch.
- It was?
And it was an unbirthday present too.
- Well, in that case.
- A very merry unbirthday
To
- You
- Mr Rabbit.
Oh, Mr Rabbit! Oh, now where did he go to?
A very merry unbirthday to us, to us
- If there are no objections let it be unanimous
- Of all the silly nonsense.
This is the stupidest tea party
I've ever been to in all my life.
Well, I've had enough nonsense.
I'm going home.
Straight home.
That rabbit. Who cares where he's going anyway?
Why, if it hadn't been for him, I-
"Tulgey Wood. "
Hmm. Curious.
I don't remember this.
Now let me see.
Oh!
Mmm, no, no, please.
No more nonsense.
Now, if I came this way,
I should go back this way.
Oh, I-I beg your pardon.
My goodness. When I get home,
I shall write a book about this place.
If I- If I ever do get home.
Oh, uh, excuse me.
Um, could one of you tell me-
Uh- Heh-heh. Never mind.
Oh, dear. It's getting dreadfully dark.
And nothing looks familiar.
I shall certainly be glad to get out of- Oh!
Who. Who-who.
Who.
It would be so nice if something would make sense for a change.
Oh!
"Don't step on the mome raths. "
The mome raths?
A path!
Oh, thank goodness.
Ah. I just knew I'd find one sooner or later.
If I hurry fast, I might even be home in time for tea.
Oh. Oh, won't Dinah be happy to see me.
Oh, I just can't wait till I- Ah!
Oh, dear. Now I-
Now I shall never get out.
Well, when- when one's lost,
I- I suppose it's good advice... to stay where you are until someone finds you.
But- But who'd ever think to look for me here?
Good advice.
If, If, If, If I'd listened earlier, I-I wouldn't be here.
But- But that's just the trouble with me.
I give myself very good advice.
But I very seldom follow it
That explains
The trouble that
I'm always in
Be patient
Is very good advice
But the waiting makes me curious
And I'd love the change
Should something strange
Begin
Well, I went along my merry way.
And I never stopped to reason.
I should have known
There'd be a price to pay
Someday
I give myself
Very good advice
But I very seldom follow it
Will I ever learn
To do the things
I should
Will I ever learn
Learn to do the things
I should
And the mome raths outgrabe
Oh, Cheshire Cat!
It's you!
Whom did you expect?
The White Rabbit perchance?
Oh, no, no, no.
I- I-I'm through with rabbits.
I wanna go home!
- But I can't find my way.
- Naturally.
That's because you have no way.
All ways here, you see, are the Queen's way.
- But I've never met any Queen.
- You haven't?
You haven't?
Oh, but you must!
She'll be mad about you.
Simply mad.
And the mome raths outgrabe
Please, please! Uh, how can I find her?
Well, some go this way.
Some go that way.
But as for me, myself, personally,
I prefer the short cut.
Painting the roses red
We're painting the roses red
We dare not stop or waste a drop
So let the paint be spread
We're painting the roses red
Oh, painting the roses red
And many a tear we shed
- Because we know
- They'll cease to grow
In fact they'll soon be dead
Ohh, and yet we go ahead
Painting the roses red, red red, red, red, red, red, red
Painting the roses red
We're painting the roses red
Oh, pardon me, but, Mr Three why must you paint them red
Huh? Oh!
Well, the fact is, miss, we planted the white roses by mistake, and-
The Queen she likes them red
If she saw white instead
- She'd raise a fuss
- And each of us
- Would quickly lose his head
- Goodness!
Since this is the thought we dread
- We're painting the roses red
- Oh, dear.
Then let me help you.
- Painting the roses red
- We're painting the roses red
Don't tell the Queen what you have seen
Or say that's what we said but we're painting the roses red
Yes, painting the roses red
- Not pink - Not green - Not aquamarine
We're painting the roses red
- The Queen!
- The Queen!
- Queen!
- The Queen!
Cards, halt!
Sound off!
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, jack!
The rabbit.
H- H-Her Imperial Highness,
Her, Her Grace,
Her Excellency, Her Royal
Majesty, the Queen of Hearts!
- And the King.
- Hooray!
Hmm! Who's been painting my roses red?
Who's been painting my roses red?
Who dares to paint with vulgar paint
The Royal flower bed
For painting my roses red
Someone will lose his head
Oh, no, Your Majesty, please!
It's all his fault!
Not me, Your Grace!
The ace! The ace!
- You? The deuce, you say?
- No! Two!
- Not me! The trey!
- That's enough!
Off with their heads!
They're going to lose their heads
For painting the roses red
It serves them right, they planted white
The roses should be red
Oh, they're going to lose their heads
Silence!
Oh, please, please.
They were only trying-
- And who is this?
- Uh, well. Well, well, now, uh, uh, let me see, my dear.
It certainly isn't a heart.
Uh, do you suppose it's a club?
Why, it's a little girl.
- Yes. A-And I was hoping-
- Look up. Speak nicely.
And don't twiddle your fingers!
Turn out your toes. Curtsy.
Open your mouth a little wider.
And always say:
"Yes, Your Majesty. "
"Yes, Your Majesty. "
Now, um, where do you come from, and where are you going?
W- Well, I-I'm trying to find my way home.
Your way? All ways here are my ways!
Well, yes, I-I know.
But I was just thinking-
Curtsy while you're thinking.
It saves time.
Uh, yes, Your Majesty.
But I was only going to ask-
I'll ask the questions!
Do you play croquet?
- Why, yes, Your Majesty.
- Then let the game begin!
To your places. To your places. By order of the King. Hurry, hurry, hurry.
Shuffle deck!
Card cut! Deal cards!
Cards, halt!
Silence!
Off with his head!
Off with his head. Off with his head. By order of the King. Uh, you heard what she said.
- You're next, my dear.
- Oh, but-
Uh, yes, Your Majesty.
Oh!
- Stop!
- Oh, of all the impossible-
Do you want us both to lose our heads?
- Uh-huh.
- Well, I don't.
Uh, I say, how are you getting on?
- Not at all.
- Beg pardon?
I said, not at all!
Who are you talking to?
- Oh, uh, a cat, Your Majesty.
- Cat? Where?
There. Oh.
- Oh, there he is again!
- I warn you, child, if I lose my temper, you lose your head!
Understand?
You know, we could make her really angry. Shall we try?
- Oh, no, no!
- Oh, but it's loads of fun.
No, no, no! Stop!
Oh, no!
Oh, my fur and whiskers!
Oh, dear! Save the Queen.
Someone's head will roll for this!
Yours!
- Off with her-
- But, but, but, but consider, my dear.
Uh, couldn't she have a trial? Huh? First?
- Trial?
- Well, th-Just a, a little trial? Hmm?
Hmm. Very well, then.
Let the trial begin!
Your Majesty.
Members of the jury.
Loyal subjects.
And the King.
The prisoner at the bar is charged with enticing Her Majesty, the Queen of Hearts, into a game of croquet and thereby willfully...
- But- - and with malice aforethought, teasing, tormenting...
- and otherwise annoying our beloved-
- Never mind all that!
Get to the part where
I lose my temper.
Thereby causing the Queen to lose her temper.
Now, are you ready for your sentence?
Sentence? Oh, but there must be a verdict first.
Sentence first!
Verdict afterwards.
- But that just isn't the way!
- All ways are-
Your ways, Your Majesty.
Uh, yes, my child.
Off with her-
- But consider, my dear. Eh, we've called no witnesses.
- Huh?
Uh, couldn't we hear maybe one or two? Huh? Maybe?
Oh, very well.
But get on with it!
- First witness. First witness. Herald, call the first witness.
- The March Hare.
Uh, oh, oh, what do you know about this, uh, unfortunate affair?
- Nothing.
- Nothing whatever?
- Nothing whatever!
- That's very important!
Jury, write that down.
Uh, unimportant, uh,
Your Majesty means of course.
Silence! Next witness.
The Dormouse.
- Well-
- Shh!
What have you to say about this?
Twinkle, twinkle, little bat.
How I wonder-
That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet.
Write that down!
- Twinkle, twinkle. Twinkle, twinkle.
- Twinkle, twinkle.
Twinkle, twinkle.
What next?
The Mad Hatter.
- Off with your hat!
- Oh, my!
And, uh, where were you when this horrible crime was committed?
I was home drinking tea.
Today, you know, is my unbirthday.
Why, my dear, today is your unbirthday too.
- It is?
- It is?
It is?
- A very merry unbirthday
- To me?
- Oh, no!
- To you! A very merry unbirthday
- For me?
- For you!
Now blow the candle out, my dear, and make your wish come true.
A very merry unbirthday
To you
Oh! Your Majesty.
Uh, yes, my dear?
Look! There he is now!
- Huh? Wha- Who?
- The Cheshire Cat.
- Cat!
- Cat?
- Cat! Cat, cat, cat, cat!
- There he goes! There he goes!
- Oh, this is terrible! Help! Help!
- Stop him! Stop him!
- Stop him. Catch him.
- Somebody help me. Catch him.
- Get me the jam. The jam, quick.
- The jam! The jam! By order of the King.
The jam. Let me have it!
Somebody's head is going to roll for this!
- Aha!
- The mushroom.
Off with her h-
Oh, pooh. I'm not afraid of you.
Why, you're nothing but a pack of cards.
Rule 42: "All persons more than a mile high... must leave the court immediately. "
I am not a mile high.
And I'm not leaving.
Sorry. Rule 42, you know.
And as for you,
Your Majesty-
Your Majesty indeed.
Why, you're not a queen.
You're just a, a fat, pompous, bad-tempered, old ty- tyrant.
And, uh, what were you saying, my dear?
Well, she simply said that you're a fat, pompous, bad-tempered, old tyrant.
Off with her head!
You heard what
Her Majesty said.
Off with her head.
Forward, backward, inward, outward
Here we go again
No one ever loses and no one can ever win
Backward, forward, outward, inward bottom to the top
- Never let the-
- Off with her head!
Off with her head!
Just a moment! You can't leave a tea party without having a cup of tea, you know.
- But I can't stop now.
- Ah, but we insist.
You must join us in a cup of tea.
Off with her head!
Mr Caterpillar, what will I do?
Who are you?
There she goes.
Don't let her get away!
Off with her head!
Oh! Still locked, you know.
But the Queen!
I simply must get out!
- But you are outside.
- What?
See for yourself.
Why- Why, that's me!
- I'm asleep.
- Don't let her get away!
- Off with her head!
- Alice, wake up. Please wake up, Alice!
- Alice! Please wake up, Alice!
- Off with her head!
Alice! Alice. Alice.
Alice. Alice.
Will you kindly pay attention and recite your lesson?
Hmm? Oh. Oh! Uh, how doth the little crocodile improve his shining tail?
- And pour the waters of the-
- Alice, what are you talking about?
Oh. I'm sorry. But you see, the caterpillar said-
Caterpillar?
Oh, for goodness' sake.
Alice, I- Oh, well.
Come along. It's time for tea.
Alice in Wonderland
Over the hill
Or here or there
I wonder where
Alice in Wonderland
How do you get to Wonderland
Over the hill
Or under land
Orjust behind the tree
Alice in Wonderland
Where is the path to Wonderland
Over the hill
Or here or there
I wonder where
I know you
I waked with you
once upon a dream
I know you
The gleam in your eyes
is so familiar a gleam
Yet I know it's true
That visions
are seldom all they seem
But if I know you
I know what you'll do
You'll Love me at once
The way you did
once upon a dream
"In a far away land
long ago lived a King...
"and his fair Queen.
"Many years had they longed
for a child...
"and finally
their wish was granted.
"A daughter was born,
and they called her Aurora."
Sweet Aurora
"Yes, they named her
after the dawn...
"for she filled their lives
with sunshine.
"Then a great holiday
was proclaimed...
"throughout the kingdom...
"so that all of high
or low estate...
"might pay homage
to the infant Princess.
"And our story begins
on that most joyful day."
On that joyful day
On that joyful day
Joyfully now
to our Princess we come
Bringing gifts
and all good wishes
To replete
our loyalty anew
Hail to the Princess Aurora
All of her subjects
adore her
Hail to the King
Hail to the Queen
Hail to the Princess Aurora
Health to the Princess,
wealth to the Princess
Long live
the Princess Aurora
Hail Aurora
Hail Aurora
Health to the Princess,
wealth to the Princess
Long Live
the Princess Aurora
Hail to the King
Hail to the Queen
Hail to the Princess Aurora
"Thus,
on this great and joyous day...
"did all the kingdom celebrate
the Awaited-awaited royal birth...
"and good King Stefan
and his Queen made welcome...
"their Lifelong friend."
Their Royal Highnesses...
King Hubert
and Prince Philip!
"Fondly had these
monarchs dreamed one day...
"their kingdoms to unite...
"thus, today would they
announce...
"that Philip,
Hubert's son and heir...
"to Stefan's child
would be betrothed."
"And so, to her
his gift he brought...
"and Looked, unknowing,
on his future bride."
Their most honored
and exalted Excellencies...
the three good fairies...
Mistress Flora...
Mistress Fauna...
and Mistress Merryweather!
- Ahh.
- Oh.
The little darling.
Your Majesties.
Each of us the child may bless... with a single gift... no more, no less.
Little Princess, my gift shall be... the gift of beauty.
One gift
Beauty rare
Gold of sunshine
in her hair
Lips that shame
the red, red rose
She'll walk with springtime
wherever she goes
Tiny Princess... my gift shall be the gift of song.
One gift
The gift of song
Melody her whole life Long
The nightingales
her tune adore
Bringing his sweet
serenade to her door
Sweet Princess, my gift shall be the...
Wind howls]
Why, it's Maleficent.
What does she want here?
Shhh.
Well...
Quite a glittering assemblage, King Stefan.
Royalty, nobility, the gentry, and... ah ha ha ha ha... how quaint.
Even the rabble.
Ooooh.
I really felt quite distressed... at not receiving an invitation.
You weren't wanted.
Not wa... ah ha.
Oh, dear, what an awkward situation.
I had hoped
it was merely due...
to some oversight.
Well, in that event,
I'd best be on my way.
And... you're not offended,
Your Excellency?
Why, no, Your Majesty... and to show I bear no ill will...
I, too, shall bestow a gift on the child.
Listen well, all of you.
The Princess shall indeed grow in grace and beauty... beloved by all who know her.
But... before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday... she shall prick her finger...
on the spindle
of a spinning wheel...
and die!
Oh, no!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
Seize that creature!
Stand back, you fools!
Don't despair,
Your Majesties.
Merryweather still has her gift to give.
Then she can undo this fearful curse?
Oh, no, sire.
Maleficent's powers are far too great.
But she can help.
But...
Just do
your best, dear.
Yes, go on.
Sweet Princess...
If through this
wicked witch's trick...
a spindle should
your finger prick...
a ray of hope
there still may be in this...
the gift I give to thee.
Not in death,
but just in sleep...
this fateful prophecy
you'll keep...
and from this slumber
you shall wake...
when true love's kiss
the spell shall break.
For true Love
conquers all
"But King Stefan...
"still fearful
of his daughter's Life...
"did then and there decree...
"that every spinning wheel
in the kingdom...
"should on that very day
be burned.
"So 'rwas done."
Oh, silly...
Now, come have a nice cup of tea, dear.
I'm sure it will work out somehow.
Well, a bonfire won't stop Maleficent.
Of course not, but what will?
Perhaps if we
reason with her...
Reason?
With Maleficent?
Well, she can't be all bad.
Oh, yes, she can.
Oooh. I'd like to turn her into a fat, old hop toad.
Now, dear, that isn't a very nice thing to say.
Besides, we can't.
You know our magic doesn't work that way. it can only do good, dear... to bring joy and happiness.
Well, that would make me happy.
But there must be some way.
But there must be some way.
There is!
There is?
What is it, Flora?
I'm going to...
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
[QUIETLY
Even walls have ears.
Follow me.
I'll turn her into a flower.
Maleficent?
No, no, dear, the Princess.
Oh, she'd make a lovely flower.
Don't you see?
A flower can't prick its finger. it hasn't any.
That's right.
She'll be perfectly safe.
Until Maleficent sends a frost.
Yes. Er...
Oh, dear.
She always ruins your nicest flowers.
You're right... and she'll be expecting us to do something like that.
Oooh.
Well, what won't she expect?
She knows everything.
Oh, but she doesn't, dear.
Maleficent doesn't know anything about love... or kindness or the joy of helping others.
You know, sometimes
I don't think...
she's really very happy.
That's it.
Of course.
It's the only thing she can't understand... and won't expect.
Oh!
Now, now, now... we have to plan it carefully.
Let's see,
the woodcutter's cottage.
Yes, yes, yes,
the abandoned one.
Of course, the King and Queen will object...
but when we explain
it's the only way...
Explain what?
About the three peasant women raising a foundling child... deep in the forest.
Oh?
Well, that's very nice of them.
Who are they?
Turn around.
- Why, it's us!
- Uh-huh.
You mean we us?
Uh-huh.
Take care of the baby?
Why not?
Oh, I'd like that!
Well, y-yes, but we'd have to feed it...
And wash it and dress it and rock it to sleep.
Oh, I'd love it.
You really think we can?
If humans can do it, so can we.
And we'd have our magic to help us.
That's right.
No, no, no, no, no, no!
No magic.
I'll take those wands right now.
Oh, better get rid of those wings, too.
You mean live like mortals?
For sixteen years?
Uh-huh.
But now... now we don't know how.
We've never done anything without magic.
And that's why Maleficent will never suspect.
But who'll wash and cook?
Oh, we'll all pitch in.
I'll take care of the baby.
Let me have it, dear.
Come along, now.
We must tell
Their Majesties at once.
Flora.
Flora.
 "So the King
and his Queen watched...
"with heavy hearts...
"as their most precious
possession, their only child...
"disappeared into the night."
"Many sad and lonely years
passed by...
"for King Stefan
and his people.
"But as the time
for the Princess's...
"sixteenth birthday
drew near...
"the entire kingdom
began to rejoice...
"for everyone knew...
"that as Long
as Maleficent's domain...
"the forbidden mountains...
"thundered with her wrath
and frustration...
"her evil prophecy
had not yet been fulfilled."
It's incredible!
Sixteen years, and not a trace of her!
She couldn't have vanished
into thin air!
Are you sure you searched everywhere?
Yeah, yeah, uh...
Everywhere... we all did.
Yeah! Yeah!
And what about the town?
The forest? The mountains?
Uh, we check mountains... uh... uh, forest...
Uh, houses and, uh, let me see, uh... and all the cradles.
Cradles?
Uh, yep, yep.
Ha ha ha ha.
Every cradle.
Cradle?!
Did you hear that, my pet?
All these years...
they've been looking
for a baby.
Oh, ha ha ha!
Fools!
Idiots!
Imbeciles!
- Aaah!
- Aaah!
Ooh! Ooh!
Ouch! Ouch!
Ahhh.
Oh, they're hopeless... a disgrace to the forces of evil.
Oh, my pet.
You are my last hope.
Circle far and wide.
Search for a maid of sixteen, with hair of sunshine gold... and lips red as the rose.
Go, and do not fail me.
"And so,
for sixteen Long years...
"the whereabouts
of the Princess...
"remained a mystery...
"while deep in the forest
in a woodcutter's cottage...
"the good fairies carried out
their well-laid plan.
"Living like mortals...
"they had reared the child
as their own...
"and called her Briar Rose."
"On this,
her sixteenth birthday...
"the good fairies
had planned a party...
"and something extra special
for a surprise."
Well, now, how about this one?
This is the one I picked.
Ooh, she'll look beautiful in that.
Now, I thought a few changes here.
Uh-huh.
Don't forget a pretty bow.
Yes, and raise the shoulder line.
We'll make it blue.
Oh, no, dear, pink.
Of course, we'll need a few pleats.
Yes, but how are
we going to get her...
out of the house?
I'll think
of something.
Well.
And what are you
three dears up to?
- Up to?
- Up to?
Up to? Er, er...
We... we want you to pick some berries.
That's it... berries.
- Berries?
- Lots of berries.
But I picked berries yesterday.
Oh, we need more, dear.
Lots, lots more.
Yes.
Now, don't hurry back, dear.
But don't go too far.
And don't speak to strangers.
Good-bye, dear.
Good-bye!
Good-bye!
I wonder if she suspected.
Of course not.
Come on.
Oh, will she be surprised.
A real birthday party... with a real birthday cake.
Yes, and a dress a Princess can be proud of.
I'll get the wands.
Yes, you g... the wands?
Oh, no!
No magic.
But the sixteen years are almost over.
We're taking no chances.
But I've never baked a fancy cake.
Oh, you won't have to, dear.
I'm going to bake the cake.
You?
Oh, she's always wanted to, dear... and this is her last chance.
Well...
I'm going to make it fifteen layers... with pink and blue forget-me-nots.
And I'm making the dress.
But you can't sew, and she's never cooked.
Oh, ho, ho, it's simple.
All you do is follow the book.
Up here, dear.
You can be the dummy.
Well, I still say we ought to use magic.
 La la
la da da da da
Dee dee dee deedle um
La da da
"Flour, 3 cups."
Cups, cups, cups, cups, cups, cups, cups.
Oh.
Dee da dee da da dum
What's that for?
Well, it's got to have a hole in the bottom.
That's for the feet
to go through.
It's pink.
Oh, lovely shade, isn't it?
But I wanted it blue.
Now, dear... we decided pink was her color.
You decided.
"Two eggs, fold in gently."
Fold?
Oh, well.
I can't breathe!
Get me out of here! it looks awful.
That's because it's on you, dear.
"Now yeast, 1 tsp."
Tsp?
One teaspoon.
One teaspoon! Of course!
Hmm.
Oh, gracious!
How that child has grown!
Oh, it seems only yesterday we brought her here.
Just a tiny baby.
Why, Merryweather!
Whatever is the matter, dear?
After today, she'll be a Princess... and we won't have any Briar Rose.
Oh, Flora!
Now, now, now, now.
W-we... we all knew this day had to come.
But why did it have to come so soon?
After all... we've had her for sixteen years.
Sixteen wonderful years.
Good gracious!
We're acting like a lot of ninnies!
Come on! She'll be back before we get started.
Do you hear that, Samson?
Beautiful!
What is it?
Come on. Let's find out.
Aw, come on.
For an extra bucket of oats?
And a few... carrots?
Hup, boy!
Whoa!
No carrots.
I wonder
I wonder
I wonder why
each little bird
Has a someone
To sing to
Sweet things to
A gay, little lark melody
I wonder
I wonder
If my heart
keeps singing
Will my song
go winging
To someone
Who'll find me
And bring back
a Love song to me
Oh, dear.
Why do they still treat me like a child?
Whoo!
Aunt Flora, Aunt Fauna...
Aunt Merryweather.
They never want me to meet anyone.
But you know something?
Whispering]
I fooled them.
I have met someone.
Whoo!
Whoo! Whoo!
Oh... a Prince.
Well, he's tall and handsome and... and so romantic!
Oh, we walk together and talk together... and just before we say good-bye... he takes me in his arms...
And then...
I wake up.
Yes,
it's only in my dreams.
But they say if you dream
a thing more than once... it's sure to come true.
And I've seen him so many times.
You know, Samson... there's something strange about that voice.
Too beautiful to be real.
Maybe it was
some mysterious being... a... a wood sprite or a...
Here! Stop!
Why,
it's my dream Prince!
Your Highness.
You know, I'm really not supposed... to speak to strangers... but we've met before.
I know you
I waked with you
once upon a dream
I know you
The gleam in your eyes
is so familiar a gleam
And I know it's true
That visions are seldom
all they seem
But if I know you
I know what you'll do
You'll Love me at once
The way you did once
upon a dream
But if I know you
I know what you'll do
You'll Love me at once
The way you did
once upon a dream
Oh!
Oh!
I'm awfully sorry.
I didn't mean to frighten you.
Oh, it... wasn't that.
It's just that you're a... a...
A stranger?
Mm-hmm.
But don't you remember?
We've met before.
We... we have?
Well, of course.
You said so yourself.
"Once upon a dream."
I know you
I walked with you
once upon a dream
I know you
The gleam in your eyes
Is so familiar a gleam
And I know it's true
That visions are
seldom all they seem
But if I know you
I know what you'll do
You'll Love me at once
The way you did once
Upon a dream
Who are you?
What's your name?
Hmm?
Oh. My name.
Why, it's... it's...
Oh, no, no! I can't! I...
Good-bye!
But when will I see you again?
Oh, never! Never!
Never!
Well... maybe someday.
When? Tomorrow?
Oh, no. This evening.
Where?
At the cottage, in the glen.
There.
Whoop!
Well, what do you think of it?
Why, it... it's a very unusual cake, isn't it?
Yes.
Of course, it will be much stiffer after it's baked.
Of course, dear.
Um... what do you think of the dress?
Well, it... it's...
It-it's not exactly...
the way it is in
the book, is it?
Oh, I improved it.
But perhaps if I added a few more ruffles... uh, what do you think?
Um... I think so.
What do you think,
Merryweather?
I think we've had enough of this nonsense!
I think we ought to think of Rose and what she'll think of this mess!
I still think what
I thunk before.
I'm going to get those wands!
You know... I think she's right.
Here they are!
Good as new!
Uh, uh, tut,
tut, tut, tut...
C-c-careful, Merryweather.
Quick!
Lock the doors.
Fauna,
you close the windows.
Oh, plug up every cranny.
We can't take any chances.
Now, you take care of the cake.
While I...
Clean the room, dear.
And I'll make the dress.
Now, hurry!
Ooh!
Come on, bucket, mop, broom.
Flora says,
"Clean up the room."
And now, to make a lovely dress fit to grace a fair Princess.
Eggs, flour, lemon
Just do it like it says here in the book.
I'll put on the candles.
Oh, no! Not pink!
Oh, no! Not pink!
Make it blue!
Merryweather!
Make it pink.
Whispering]
Make it blue.
Oh! Pink!
Blue!
Oh, now look
what you've done!
Shh! Shh! Listen!
It's Rose!
She's back!
Enough of this foolishness!
Make it pink.
Now hide! Quick!
Whispering]
Blue!
Aunt Flora!
Good gracious!
Who left the mop running?
Stop, mop!
Aunt Flora!
Fauna! Merryweather!
Where is everybody?
Oh!
Surprise! Surprise!
Happy Birthday!
Oh, you darlings!
This is the happiest day of my life!
Everything's so wonderful!
Just wait till you meet him!
Him?
Rose!
You've met some stranger?
Oh, he's not a stranger.
We've met before.
You have?
Where?
Once upon a dream.
I know you
I walked with you
once upon a dream
She's in love!
- Oh, no!
- This is terrible!
Why?
After all, I am sixteen. it isn't that, dear.
You're already betrothed.
Betrothed?
Since the day you were born.
To Prince Phillip, dear.
But that's impossible.
How could I marry a Prince?
I'd have to be...
A Princess.
And you are, dear.
Princess Aurora.
Tonight, we're taking you back
to your father, King Stefan.
But... but I can't!
He's coming here tonight.
I promised to meet him.
I'm sorry, child.
But you must never see that young man again.
Oh, no! No!
I can't believe it!
No! No!
And we thought she'd be so happy.
No sign of her yet, Hubert.
Of course not.
It's a good half-hour till sunset.
Ah, excellent bird.
Mmm!
Aw, now, come, man!
Buck up!
Battle's over.
Girl is
as good as here.
I'm sorry, Hubert... but after sixteen years of worrying... never knowing...
The past! All in the past!
Tonight,
we toast the future... with something I've been saving for sixteen years.
Here!
To the future!
Right, Hubert.
To the future!
Skumps! Skumps!
Skumps!
A toast to this night
The outlook is rosy
The future is bright
Our children
will marry
Our kingdoms unite
Skumps, skumps,
skumps
Ah!
Excellent vintage!
And now, to the new home, eh?
New home?
Children need a nest of their own, what?
A place to raise their
little brood, eh?
Well,
I suppose, in time.
Of course! To the home!
- Skumps!
- Skumps!
A toast to the home
One grander, by far
Than a palace in Rome
Uh, let me fill up your glass.
Ha! Ha! That last was all foam.
Skumps, skumps, skumps
The plans!
Weir,
what do you think?
Nothing elaborate, of course.
Forty bedrooms, dining hall.
Honeymoon cottage, really.
You... you mean... you're building it already?
Built, man! Finished!
Lovebirds can move in tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
But, Hubert, they're not even married yet!
I'll take care of that tonight.
To the wedding!
Now, hold on, Hubert.
I haven't even seen
my daughter yet...
and you're taking her
away from me.
Getting
my Philip, aren't you?
Yes, but...
Want to see our
grandchildren, don't we?
Of course, but...
Well, there's no time to lose.
Getting on in years.
Ha! Ha! Ha!
To the wedding!
Now,
be reasonable, Hubert.
After all, Aurora knows
nothing about all this.
- Well?
- Well, it... it... may come as quite a shock.
Shock?!
My Phillip a shock?!
What's wrong with my Phillip?
Nothing, Hubert.
I only meant...
Why doesn't your daughter like my son?
Now, now...
I'm not so sure my son likes your daughter!
Now, see here...
I'm not so sure my grandchildren... want you for a grandfather!
Why, you... you unreasonable... pompous, blustering, old windbag!
Unreasonable? Pompous?
En garde, sir!
I warn you, Hubert!
This means war!
Forward!
For honor! For country! For...
What's this all about, anyway?
Nothing, Hubert.
Absolutely nothing.
The children are bound to fall in love with each other.
Precisely.
And as for grandchildren...
I'll have the royal woodcarvers... start work on the cradle tomorrow!
Splendid!
King size, of course?
Certainly.
To the Woodcarver's Guild!
His Royal Highness...
Prince Philip!
Phillip!
Oh, Phillip!
Phillip!
Phillip! Hold, Phillip!
H-hurry, boy!
Hurry! Change into something suitable!
Can't meet your future bride looking like that.
But I have met her, Father.
You have? Where?
Once upon a dream.
Phillip!
Stop! Stop that!
Phillip! P-put me down!
Now... what's all this dream nonsense? it wasn't a dream, Father.
I really did meet her.
The Princess Aurora?
Good heavens!
We must tell Stefan!
Why, this is the most...
I didn't say it was Aurora.
You most certainly did!
You... you said that...
I said I met the girl
I was going to marry.
I don't know who she was.
A peasant girl,
I suppose...
A peasant g-girl?
You're... you're going to marry a...
Why, Phillip!
You're joking!
Uh... isn't he?
No! Y-you can't do this to me!
Give up the throne?
The kingdom?
For some... some nobody?
By Harry, I won't have it!
You're a Prince!
And you're going to marry a Princess!
Now, Father, you're living in the past.
This is the 14th century.
Nowadays...
Nowadays,
I'm still the King!
And I command you to come to your senses!
And marry the girl I love.
- Exactly!
- Good-bye, Father.
"Good-bye, Father.
Marry the girl you..."
No, no!
No, no, Phillip, stop!
Come back!
Oh, Philip!
Phillip!
Oh!
Oh, how... how will
I ever tell Stefan?
Whispering]
Come along, now.
All right, in here, dear.
Bolt the door,
Merryweather!
Fauna, pull the drapes!
And now, dear, if you'll just sit here.
This one last gift... dear child for thee... the symbol of thy royalty.
A crown to wear in grace and beauty, as is thy right and royal duty.
Now, dear.
Whispering]
Come.
Let her have a few moments alone.
It's that boy she met.
Whatever are we going to do?
Oh, I don't see why she has to marry any old Prince.
Now, that's not for us to decide, dear.
Maybe we should tell King Stefan about the boy.
Well, why don't we?
Listen!
Maleficent! Rose!
Rose! Rose! Aah!
Oh, why did
we leave her alone?
Rose! Rose!
Here.
Rose! Rose!
Rose, where are you?
Where are you?
Rose!
Rose!
Rose!
Rose!
Rose, don't touch anything!
Touch the spindle.
Touch it, I say!
You poor, simple fools.
Thinking you could defeat me.
Me, the mistress
of all evil!
Well, here's your precious Princess.
Rose!
Oh, Rose!
Oh, I'll never forgive myself.
We're all to blame!
Stefan, there's... there's something important
I have to tell you.
Not now, Hubert.
But it's about Phillip.
Phillip?
Oh, yes, of course, Phillip.
Why, where is the boy?
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
Well, send for him immediately!
- But...
- Shh!
The sun has set!
Make ready to welcome
your Princess!
Poor King Stefan and the Queen.
They'll be heartbroken when they find out.
They're not going to.
They aren't?
We'll put them all to sleep... until Rose awakens.
Come!
Sleeping beauty fair
Gold of sunshine
In your hair
Lips that shame
The red, red rose
Dreaming of true Love
In slumber repose
One day he will come
Riding out of the dawn
And you'll awaken
To Love's first kiss
Till then,
Sleeping Beauty
Sleep on
One day you'll awaken
To Love's first kiss
Till then,
Sleeping Beauty
Sleep on
Well, just been talking to Phillip.
Seems he's fallen in love with some...
Peasant girl.
Peasant girl?
Yes? Yes?
The peasant girl... who is she?
Where did he meet her?
Just some peasant girl he met.
Where?! Where?!
Once upon a dream.
Once upon a dr...
Rose! Prince Phillip!
Oh! Oh!
Come on.
We've got to get back to the cottage.
Whistling
Once Upon a Dream]
Come in!
Well... this is a pleasant surprise.
I set my trap for a peasant, and lo,
I catch a Prince!
Away with him.
But gently, my pets... gently.
I have plans for our royal guest.
Maleficent!
She's got Prince Phillip!
At the forbidden mountain.
But we can't!
We can't go there!
We can, and we must!
What a pity Prince Phillip... can't be here to enjoy the celebration.
Come.
We must go to the dungeon and cheer him up.
Oh, come now, Prince Phillip.
Why so melancholy?
A wondrous future lies before you.
You, the destined hero... of a charming fairy tale come true.
Behold...
King Stefan's castle...
And in yonder
topmost tower...
Dreaming of her true Love...
the Princess Aurora.
But see the gracious
whim of fate.
Why, 'tis the selfsame
peasant maid...
who won the heart
of our noble Prince...
but yesterday.
She is indeed
most wondrous fair.
Gold of sunshine
in her hair.
Lips that shame
the red, red rose.
In ageless sleep...
she finds repose.
The years roll by... but a hundred years to a steadfast heart... are but a day.
And now the gates
of a dungeon part...
and our Prince
is free to go his way.
Off he rides
on his noble steed...
a valiant figure...
straight and tall... to wake his love... with love's first kiss...
and prove that true Love
conquers all.
Why, you... you...
Come, my pet.
Let us leave our noble Prince... with these happy thoughts.
A most gratifying day.
For the first time in sixteen years...
I shall sleep well.
Shh! No time to explain.
Wait, Prince Phillip.
The road to true love may be barred... by still many more dangers...
which you alone
will have to face.
So arm thyself... with this enchanted shield of virtue...
and this mighty sword
of truth.
For these weapons
of righteousness...
will triumph over evil.
Now, come. We must hurry.
Whinnies]
Phillip, watch out!
Silence!
You, tell those fools to...
No! No!
Watch out, Phillip!
Hurry! Hurry, Phillip!
A forest of thorns shall be his tomb.
A forest of thorns shall be his tomb.
Born through the skies on a fog of doom.
Now go with the curse
and serve me well...
Round Stefan's castle...
Cast my spell!
Whinnies]
Whinnies]
No, it cannot be!
Now shall you deal with me, o Prince... and all the powers of hell!
Whinnies]
Up! Up this way!
Now, Sword of Truth, fly swift and sure... that evil die and good endure!
Oh, oh, uh, forgive me, Hubert.
The wine.
Now, uh, you were saying?
Huh? I was?
Oh, oh, yes.
Well, after all, Stefan... this is the 14th century.
Yes. You, uh... you said that a moment ago.
Well, to come right to the point... my son Phillip says he's going to marry...
It's Aurora. She's here!
And... and... and Phillip!
What does this mean, boy?
I... I don't...
But, but, but...
I don't understand.
Why, Fauna, what's the matter, dear?
Oh, I just love happy endings.
Yes. I do, too.
Blue?!
Pink!
I know you,
I walked with you once...
Blue!
... upon a dream
I know you
The gleam in your eyes
Is so familiar a gleam
And I know it's true
That visions
are seldom all they seem
But if I know you
I know what you'll do
You'll Love me at once
The way you did once
Upon
A
Dream

To the world we all know,
which may or may not be the best world possible,
once again Springtime had come.
But all the magic of Spring was not enough to conceal the misery of Manor Farm.
Once thriving and fruitful, the farm, and its owner, Mr Jones,
had fallen on evil days.
Beset by problems of his own making,
Mr Jones had turned to drink
and for his misery he had found poor company.
On the evening our story begins,
it was later than usual when Mr Jones came home from his drinking to make his rounds.
Damned old hens.
Good for nothing beasts... eat their heads off.
On this night
all the animals had agreed that as soon as Mr Jones was in bed,
they would gather in the main barn for a secret meeting, called by Old Major,
the prize boar hog who, because of his years, was regarded by far the wisest of the animals.
The other pigs started first for the meeting, being clever and fond of taking the lead.
They were followed by Boxer, largest and strongest of the horses,
and his devoted friend Benjamin, the donkey.
All the other animals, great and small, were anxious to get there.
For such a meeting had never been held before.
Old Major had been ailing and now, he had made known,
there were some things he wanted to say to his fellow animals, before it might be too late.
It took a while for all to find their seats.
The pigs had taken up the best positions immediately in front of the platform, among them Snowball,
determined to get a good view.
And Napoleon, equally determined and even less polite.
What was that?
No.
No, it wasn't Mr Jones.
At last everyone could be settled to hear Old Major.
My dear friends...
I have lived a long life...
I have had much time for thought as I lay alone in my stall.
I won't be with you... much longer... and before I die there's something
I want to tell you.
Few of us will ever know the blessings of a peaceful old age.
You... Boxer... when you have given the last of your great strength...
What then?
Whatever we produce is taken from us.
Stolen from us... and sold.
Our children are born... to cold and hunger.
Look at them while you can.
You porkers... do you know what the future holds for you?
Do we deserve such a fate?
Is this farm too poor to support us all?
No, comrades.
Manor Farm is rich.
But we'll never get our rightful share from Farmer Jones.
Overthrow this evil tyrant... and we shall be rich and free.
Comrades...
REVOLT!
But remember...
When you have got rid of Jones... don't adopt his vices.
We animals... are brothers; large or small; clever or simple; fur or feathers; now and forever...
All animals are EQUAL!
The very next morning, sooner perhaps than Old Major would have predicted,
the animals found their situation quite unbearable.
And so, almost before they realised it,
the animals had fought and won!
They had casualties to mourn, and those who died left children to be cared for.
But Manor Farm was theirs
and they lost no time in destroying everything that reminded them of hateful Mr Jones.
When it came to Mr Jones's house, the animals hesitated.
Napoleon showed the way.
But Snowball took the lead in entering the place where their tyrant had lived.
They agreed that Jones's house was no place for them.
All, that is, except Napoleon.
Meantime,
Snowball led the other animals in organising a new society which they now named Animal Farm.
So that all might see and agree the laws of
Animal Farm were inscribed in a prominent place
to be remembered and obeyed forever.
No animal shall sleep in a bed.
No animal shall drink alcohol.
Four legs good, two legs bad.
Wings count as legs.
Four legs good, two legs bad.
Four legs good, two legs bad.
No animal shall kill another animal.
All animals are equal!
Tending the farm by themselves posed problems for the animals,
but the pigs could figure a way round every difficulty.
Boxer was the admiration of everybody.
He had been a hard worker in Jones's time but now he seemed more like three horses than one.
Instructed by Snowball, other animals worked out the rest for themselves.
And the farm work was done like magic.
The success of their efforts delighted everyone
including sly Napoleon and his constant companion Fat Pig Squealer.
That summer, the animals, without any help or any interference, made a going proposition of Animal Farm.
The fields yielded richly and they were cut and gleaned with diligence and devotion.
With the harvest safely home, the animals had time to think of the future
and, at a meeting in the big barn, many resolutions were put forward.
It was always the pigs that made the resolutions.
Comrades... our first five months' plan... is a farm-wide triumph.
And the time has come... to spread the glorious news, so that our downtrodden comrades on other farms will break their chains... and join... the Animal Revolution.
Go! Tell the wonders of Animal Farm to the world.
Some animals, content with their lot, were unimpressed with tales of peace and plenty.
Others, happy in their own surroundings, were alarmed at the thought of any change.
But wherever they were having a bad time, animals listened with interest.
In certain quarters the rebellious behaviour of a lot of dumb animals
caused indignation and much conversation.
But nothing was done about it for the drunken
Mr Jones and his cronies did not know what to do.
Snowball felt that education was the animals' next necessity.
Some of the animals were brighter than others, of course.
B, C, D.
E!
Four legs good, two legs bad.
Snowball set himself to solve the problem of power on the farm.
And so did Napoleon.
In January there came bitterly hard weather.
Inexperienced management brought shortages to Animal Farm.
But Snowball continued his thinking for the future.
And in such thoughts he was not alone!
Comrades, I have prepared a new plan for Animal Farm.
Here it is; all it needs is your vote.
At first we will have to work more and eat less.
But my plan... will bring us electricity.
It will mean a warm barn in winter...
A light... in every stall... sty and roost.
Luxury for all.
Comrades, in one short year Animal Farm will be the finest in the world.
Dreams, dreams.
A vote for my plan is a vote for the life beautiful.
It's a lie.
I promise you a four-day week.
Bosh.
Perhaps a three-day week.
Nonsense.
A one day week.
With Snowball disposed of Napoleon stepped up confidently to take charge of Animal Farm.
And Fat Pig Squealer became his obedient follower and assistant.
Comrades, Snowball is a traitor!
What was he really planning?
To bring back Jones!
Now... let's have no more of these useless meetings... eh?
From now on, I'll protect your interests... and I'll make your decisions.
Let me show you my plan for Animal Farm.
Four legs good, two legs bad.
Hip Hip Hooray.
For "Napoleon" Mill.
And so the windmill was started after all.
Nothing could have been achieved without Boxer
whose strength was greater than that of all the other animals put together.
Superintended by the pigs all the animals worked long shifts which lasted from dawn till dusk.
Rations were shortened for the workers but the pigs, by virtue of their brain work,
were plentifully provided for.
But the greatest inspiration came from Boxer who, with his friend Benjamin,
worked early and late, in season and out.
One evening after working long and late, as usual,
Boxer and Benjamin made a curious discovery.
Word of what now went on at night in Jones's house spread quickly through Animal Farm.
Some of the animals thought they remembered a law against beds but obviously they were mistaken.
And now... other changes in the laws of Animal Farm were in store.
Those ungrateful beasts of yours!
Cheer up, they won't last.
Another winter will bring them to their knees.
Anyway, where are they going to buy the things they need?
In Mr Jones's circle, the subject of shortages at Animal Farm was a popular one.
And a sharp trader named Whymper was just the sort to do something about it.
Comrades! Our leader, as wise as he is beloved, has decided to trade with the outside world.
Not for gain, of course, that would be unworthy of our noble principles.
You hens... are to have the honour of making the first contribution. All your eggs.
I know how proud you are of this privilege...
The chickens seemed to remember that Old Major said their eggs should never be taken from them.
The innocent suffered with the guilty.
The chicken's uprising was short-lived.
Comrades I have made a terrible discovery.
There are traitors among us!
Yes, comrades, in league with Jones and Snowball.
To destroy Animal Farm!
Who else is guilty?
Stand up and confess.
The revolution is now complete.
We have no more use for that song.
Singing it is now forbidden.
Under penalty of DEATH!
Trade between Animal Farm and the outer world now became quite brisk.
As might be expected, Mr Whymper's profits inspired others to seek their share.
Or at least, give vent to their jealousy.
Animal Farm seems to be making money.
For Whymper.
Who ever heard of animals running a farm.
Have you seen their wind mill.
- Come on, let's kick them out.
- Yeah, kick them out.
The original owner was not invited to join this movement.
His neighbours let him know his day was done.
Comrades. The enemy has mobilised all his forces against us.
We must save Animal Farm from the hateful enemy.
At all costs we animals must unite.
Now is the time to fight - to die for Animal Farm.
Let us show them all that Animal Farm is strong.
Now began the heartbreaking job of rebuilding.
And as before, Boxer and Benjamin worked hardest of all.
By now supervision of the work by pigs was hardly necessary.
So they had time for less laborious pursuits.
Long after the other animals left the job...
Boxer and Benjamin worked on and on, giving their all, year in, year out.
A new generation of pigs grew up
endowed with what were considered arts and graces very flattering to Animal Farm.
And its presiding genius!
But still the windmill was not finished.
And Boxer's injured foot got worse instead of better.
It looked as though Boxer were dead.
But he wasn't. Not quite.
Boxer's hurt bad, he'll never work again.
What do we do?
While Napoleon and Squealer made plans for Boxer,
Benjamin predicted he could look forward to a well-earned rest and retirement.
Next day the windmill work went on as usual, but now without Boxer.
And during the morning what appeared to be an ambulance arrived.
Only Benjamin suspected it wasn't an ambulance.
The other animals finally recognised the death wagon from Mr Whymper's glue factory.
I was with him right to the end.
His last words were
"Forward comrades, long live Napoleon".
As for the wicked rumour that Boxer was sold to a glue factory.
Our beloved leader would never do that.
Long live Napoleon.
Long live Napoleon!
And that night, the pigs drank to Boxer's memory in the whiskey they had bought with Boxer's life.
Years passed, the seasons came and went.
Their short animal lives fled by.
The completed windmill stood as a monument to its builders' faith and sacrifice.
But the animals' revolution was only dimly remembered.
Outwardly Animal Farm appeared prosperous,
but the animals themselves were no better off,
with the exception of the pigs, and their supreme leader, Napoleon.
This pig-run enterprise now had many of the frills of real civilization
and one fine day, pig delegates from far and wide arrived at Animal Farm
to celebrate the coming of a new era.
When reports of this great change reached them, other animals everywhere were incredulous.
Dismayed and indignant, they headed towards Animal Farm from all directions,
instinctively uniting, once again, in common cause.
Loyal followers, on farms owned and operated by pigs... there is order and discipline.
Our lower animals do more work and eat less than on other farms.
This... will encourage you to make your lower animals work even harder and eat even less.
To a greater Animal Farm!
To peace and plenty under pig rule.
To the day when pigs own and operate farms everywhere.
To the animals it now seemed that their world,
which may or may not someday become a happy place to live in,
was worse than ever for ordinary creatures,
and another moment had come when they must do something about it.

Jiro!
Come!
Ah, my sister is calling us.
Are we all here? Where's Jiro?
Let's eat!
Take that.
Well, that was a good meal.
Yes, Jiro, you can eat.
Sasuke, Sasuke, see them.
Oh, an eagle took the fawn.
Wait!
I told you to wait.
Dear brother, what you saw was a witch ...
It is said that many years ago, when Japan was a bright new country, there was a bad witch, envious and greedy, who wanted to take away all the pleasures of the Japanese people.
The witch cast magical spells over them, and made them suffer.
But there was a great Japanese king then, who knew magic too ... and he heard of the evil she was doing.
He came to the forest where she was, and punished her.
She was transformed into a small salamander.
Years passed and the king who knew the magic died.
She's transformed back ino her former self, and now has returned to make the innocent suffer.
Her name is Yasha, the evil Princess.
Sister, I want to learn magic.
You'll see how I defeat her.
- You're just a kid
- What? We must fight against the witch.
Sasuke, I know what you feel but can't you wait until you're a little older ... won't you?
Tinkerbell!
Tinkerbell, go back home.
Tinkerbell, go back!
Do you understand what I said?
Hold my stick.
But it's' Tinkerbell ... At this hour?
What's this?
Dear sister,
I am going to learn magic.
Do not worry about me,
I love you. Sasuke
Sasuke... Sasuke
Sasuke... Sasuke
Oh Tinkerbell, his staff ...
What do we do? If it's gone we can not stop ...
God, please protect my little brother and guide him in everything.
Oh ... Who's' been?
My name is Sasuke.
Who are you?
How do you say? I am Genroku, the most terrible bandit in Japan.
A bandit? And why don't you work like the other people?
Work? Ah ah ah!
Come here, I will give you a lesson.
Come on, Genroku.
You think you're very smart?
Take that!
Take that!
Failure.
What's up, Genroku?
Work for me and obey me.
Get up!
Are you okay? Boy, I have not seen you at your house and you leave your sister alone.
Boy, I watched you walk away from your house and you left your sister alone.
Who told you who I am?
- I know you well.
- Really?
On top of this mountain lives a hermit and he is the only one who can teach the magic that you want to learn.
But the mountain is higher than you can climb, kid.
I'll climb it, find the hermit and I'll learn the magic ...
But you ... Where has he gone?
- Are you the hermit?
- Yes, Sasuke. You are very brave.
- And you, how did you climb up here?
- Sasuke, you'll stay here with me
- and I'll teach you magic.
- Really?
- Yes, Sasuke, you deserve to know my secrets because you're brave and courageous.
- Shall we start now?
- Yes, I want to help.
You will do what I say.
Very good ... Sasuke, you think you are strong enough?
- Yes.
- And then tomorrow you will fill them.
You must be careful ... What would you do if the witch takes you by surprise?
Stay alert, always remember what
I tell you ... Stay alert.
- Well, always alert.
- The boy will learn.
You have to leave
Tinkerbell all the work ...
I'm going to learn magic.
Take that, take that!
Take that, take that!
Take that, take that!
Take that!
Take that!
It's too early to say. Another time ...
Are you ready?
Take that!
- Here I am.
- Good.
Tell me Sasuke, do you miss your home?
- No. .. A little.
- I know, Sasuke. But not missing it much.
Well ... Look, sir: what's this?
I think it's a fire, Sasuke.
The bandits are coming and setting fire to everything they encounter.
- Bandits, sir?
- You'll find bad people wherever you go.
Hurry!
That's all, let's go!
- Wait.
- And now what's that?
We enter here.
Hey ... Thieves!
Hurry ... Come on!
Prince Yukimura ... Lord, the bandits burned the city.
What? Get the horses.
Where are you going, child?
Do not leave me, wait!
Prince Yukimura ... Let's go!
Run away!
Friends, I promise: the bandits will repent of this.
Hey, wake up, eat this and then return home.
No, bandits, I'm not going home without my trunk, get it?
You want your trunk back?
Nothing to be done.
Listen, baby, here the boss is Yasha, a bad Princess and ugly witch.
What kind of bandits are these, if they are controlled by a woman?
Genroku, Prince Yukimura will attack if he finds us here.
I hope you have a sufficient number of guards.
Well, I think ...
- Idiot, Go.
Please be a good girl ... If Yasha sees you here, she'll have us killed, please go away.
I don't care, I'm not going without my trunk.
Where are you all?
Guards!
Guards!
Where have they got to?
Here we are ... What a beautiful day.
We were on the job.
And you would be the guards?
What were you doing?
- Uh, nothing, sir. Really.
- Nothing, sir.
Prince Yukimura wants to attack us.
If you are not alert, I'll have your heads.
Boss, you can count on us.
Enough! To your positions!
Master, isn't she beautiful for a country girl?
Excuse me, Miss, I want to know something
...  are the bandits gone from here?
You see before you Prince Yukimura, and
I am his servant.
We traveled a long way today and we want a little refreshment,if it's possible.
Certainly, but my home is a humble one.
Come.
Bandits live in the mountains there.
Perhaps those are the ones you are looking for.
These are delicious.
- I understand ... And where is Sasuke?
- Oh prince, he's been missing for 3 years and I wonder where he is.
Sasuke, each time you become better.
Now try again.
All right, Sasuke. Ready?
Forgive me, I made a mistake.
Do not worry, kid.
Soon you'll be an expert.
I want to help. If one day you need me, let me know.
- Thank you.
- We'll meet again.
Farewell, prince.
- Yasha, I have news.
- Be quiet, don't you see you're interrupting my dance?
Yes, but this is most important.
The guards saw the prince.
What? Where?
He's in a house with a beautiful girl.
With a beautiful girl?
Why didn't you tell me before?
Because I didn't know myself..
The guards overheard them while they were talking about her brother.
- He has learned magic.
- Magic?
And I suppose you did not find out his name ...
His name is Sasuke.
Sasuke?
But he's just a child.
And you, why are you laughing?
Genroku, I order you and your men to kill this Sasuke who knows magic.
Prince Yukimura and the girl: not a word more, understand?
Move!
- I ask that you kill them all.
- All right.
- Are you ready? Ready to go?
- Yes.
What is happening?
Oh, no ... This way.
- Where is the girl?
- Over there.
After them!
Where did they go?
Where are they?
Sasuke!
- You called me, sir?
- Yes, Sasuke.
It's been some time since you came here, boy.
Sasuke, this will be your first test of your powers.
- Yes?
- I have taught you everything I know.
Go, now! And remember to always have trust in yourself.
Girl, you gotta get away, we can't hide you any more.
- No.
- All the pretty girls are going to be killed.
I? Ah, I see. You want to save me because I'm pretty.
Oh no, now she thinks she's pretty.
Please, girl.
I'm saying to you please.
For the last time, if you don't go now ... Ouch!
If you don't go now, we'll throw you off this cliff.
Ha ha, I'm not afraid. I dare you.
- Oh, what do we do now?
- I don't know.
- What do you think? Throw her?
- Maybe it 's the best thing to do.
- Eh? What are you doing?
- You will see.
- Why?
- Why? Because you won't go home.
- This will hurt us more than it hurts you.
- You don't have to do it.
You hit me.
Ah, what are you doing?
It hurts.
- All right ... I think you're safe now.
- Thank you.
- Ah, you scared me ... Who are you?
- I am Sasuke, the best magician in all of Japan.
- Are you really?
- Right now no. Maybe one day I will be.
Sure, when you're bigger.
Now you're a boy ... Ha, ha.
Sasuke, the bandits stole my trunk.
You can get it back with magic?
You said bandits?
Sure.
- Sure, as soon as I've seen my sister.
- Sister? You have a sister?
- Yes, I have not seen her for a long time.
- Really?
- Can I come to meet her?
- Sure you can come.
- Thank you.
- Not at all.
Is it much further?
Sasuke, I'm tired.
No, it's just up the road.
Forward.
Sister!
Sister! Sister!
Sister!
Sister!
Tinkerbell! Where's my sister?
- Sasuke!
- Sister!
Sasuke...
I am very happy to see you.
I missed you a lot.
I missed you a lot too.
We need help, please go to the Prince Yukimura.
Okay.
Open up!
My name is Sasuke and
I want to speak with the prince.
What are you asking?
Who do you think you are, boy?
- Get out of my way.
- You shameless brat, I'll show you.
Where is he?
Thank you, guard.
It was easy to enter.
Guard, what's going on here?
A boy was flying there.
You're right, I must raise the alarm.
Who's there?
You must be Sasuke!
- Sasuke, I'm happy to see you.
- And you are very careful, prince.
Yes, you're very careful
... and my sister thinks you are perfect.
How's your sister?
Is there any news?
She has had a terrible time.
The bandits have burned our house ...
- ..and she had to hide otherwise they'd have killed her.
- What? Bandits?
Master, a boy has got in and is somewhere in the palace.
- I'm looking for him now.
- Wait, the one you are looking for is here.
It's the brother of that beautiful girl.
The bandits wanted to kill her.
What? Kill that beautiful girl?
We will leave at once!
Attack!
- Bandits!
- Quiet! Princess Yasha wants to see you.
No, no, no!
My sister's comb.
Sasuke, there's no time to lose.
You are Sasuke's sister, eh?
I hate beauty.
I want to disfigure you, my dear.
Sasuke, go behind the mountain.
I'll go 'this way.
All right.
- Sasuke, I can go with you?
- You stay here.
- Why  not?
- Ah, ah, wait here until you see our signal to you.
- We need your help here.
- Sure, you can give orders to our new friends.
Can I give the orders?
Okay, I'll wait here.
- Halt!
- Goodbye.
- No mercy for them, understand?
- Understood.
I can't bear this waiting.
Follow me.
- Where is he?
- Here.
Stand and fight.
- They're coming.
- Ha ha, we'll prepare a nice welcome.
- You know what to do with the girl ... right, Genroku?
- Yes, Your Highness.
And now tell me where my sister is.
Otherwise ... One, two ...
- Stop, she's in the house of the witch.
- Yes, in the witch's house.
I've been waiting for you.
Well, where is my sister?
Want to know?
- See for yourself ... Genroku!
- Yes.
- Sister!
- Oh, Sasuke.
- Cowards.
- Sasuke, you challenge me?
Then your sister will die.
You see, Sasuke, you can not defy me now, can you?
Sasuke.
- Genroku!
- Oh, that brat. I want to teach him a lesson.
Cut the rope!
Come on, help me to take it.
Help me.
That's it... friend ... That's it.
Hold on! I will save you.
Sasuke, how can I thank you?
You killed the evil princess.
You are a brave boy, I need someone like you.
Will you come to serve me in the palace?
Yes, Your Highness. That would be a pleasure.
Let's go!
END
