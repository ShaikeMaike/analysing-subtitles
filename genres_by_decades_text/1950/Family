Is this my seat?
BEACH - HOTEL - GOLF - STATION
Back then, my dear lady,
I was a captain in the cavalry...
This is awful!
Take this away.
Monsieur...?
Sorry?
- May I?
- Hulot.
H-U-L-O-T.
Your tobacco.
Hey!
Scram!
- Good night, monsieur.
- Monsieur, madame.
Telephone! New York!
- What's going on? That's not ours.
- It’s my son's. Where can he be?
Denis!
I only have a sleeve left to do on mine.
I haven't even finished the front!
Hey, come here, little one.
- Did you touch the winch?
- No.
Catch, Jean.
A boat... and another one... two, three, four.
It’s magnificent.
Papa, look at Monsieur Hulot.
Ice creams! Choc-ices! Candied fruit!
ICE CREAM
I'm so sorry, please forgive me.
North of our positions the situation was grave.
A decision was called for.

That's Monsieur Ménard, the proprietor.
- May I?
- By all means.
You did it on purpose.
I never touched the winch!
Here she is.
Sit down.
What is there for lunch?
- Weren't you there this morning?
- No, we were shrimping.
You missed a fine boat launch.
Some people are worse than children.
- Do you think it was a holiday-maker?
- Without doubt, madame.
- White wine, five lots of two!
- Leg of lamb!
- It’s there.
- And then an escalope.
- It’s a go. Bring me the other four.
- OK, my fault.
- A beer.
- OK, got that.
- One Badoit.
- One steak, rare and some bread.
- OK.
- Moules marinière!
And now for the latest prices from the stock exchange...
Madame Paillaud, please join the group, don't be shy.
You look just fine.
Come on.
It will be a lovely souvenir for you.
It will only take a moment.
I have an idea.
Let's swap hats, the two of us.
That will look funny.
Keep still now!
Monsieur Schmutz, telephone.
My documents.
London? Schmutz speaking.
Have you sold?
My file.
I'm so happy to have arrived.
Do you know that man?
A real gentleman.
What a journey! Half an hour's wait, no restaurant car, people treading on your feet and an unbearable heat...
..all those people at the station,
I thought I'd die of thirst.
Not a drop of mineral water in sight.
Mad rushes to catch connections!
It was so hot.
You have no idea.
This is unbelievable.
What's happened to my cases?
Thank you so much.
Out for a stroll?
And you, behind, watch out!
I nearly hit the lady.
What a business. Don't you give signals?
Don't you ever give signals?
You chump!
Hurry up, Denise, everyone's waiting.
Come on.

Good night, ladies and gentlemen.
We shall be on the air again at 6:30 tomorrow morning.
Join us! Join us!
Ah, the Major. Always very soldierly.
Martine, come and see this blue sky.
Look. Wonderful, isn't it?
What a delightful scene, don't you think?
How I love the sea.
The rocks, the pretty white sails...
It’s all so beautiful.
Is that Saint-Nazaire over there?
Far along the coast.
Over there?
I find seaside holidays so restful.
If it wasn't for the wind, of course.
It’s impossible to keep one's hair in place.
The cohesion of bourgeoisism falls apart completely.
As for progressivism... yes, but prudently.
A categorical collectivism...
I was in the same sector that English army, Tommies.
At that time I was an officer, you know, in the Ardennes, a very dangerous sector.
You remember?
I receive orders from the General.
I led a difficult mission.
I don't know if you recall the Ardennes in wartime.
But, trust me, it wasn't like strolling down the Champs-Elysées.
May I leave the table?
At my place I've got some sensational
Billie Holiday recordings.
- I prefer the Duke.
- Or Fats Waller.
- OK. King size?
- Or would you prefer one of these?
Wait for me!
Get in!
We'll catch them up.
- Let us help.
- Get in.
Sit down.

No, this way!

That's it.
Don't you greet Madame Dubreil?
There's no way to play with him.
It’s impossible, it's not tennis!
Backhand, forehand...
Goodness me.
Hello, Marie-France.
What is it?
Do you think it's funny?
There you are.
Well played.
It’s your turn.
This is ridiculous.
Play, then.

A seashell!
Another one!
It’s pretty.
Here, take this one, it's splendid.
Did you remember the swimsuit?
- Monsieur Schmutz.
- Hold this for me.
Oh, come on, let's go.

MASKED BALL
Don't stop listening. ln a few moments, an address by
Monsieur Durrieux, Minister of State.
And now, Monsieur Durrieux.
Fellow citizens, this is a grave moment.
I am speaking to you on behalf of the government as it seeks to bear its responsibilities to the electorate... even to those unfamiliar with parliamentary affairs.
What is the issue?
I challenge our carping critics to produce new solutions...
..which relates to the haemorrhaging of funds, are higher than our exports by several hundred billion.
We will inevitably have to make savings in order that...
Financial difficulties become tragic when we turn to issues of armament.
Because the changes for the infantryman during the last three worldwide wars show that war...
Madame Verdaz and Madame Paillaud... in Monsieur Bresson's car.
Oh, but Monsieur Verdaz is going to be jealous.
Madame Giraud... in Monsieur Reynald's car!
Mum, I'm coming.
But, Major, whose car are we in?
Nobody has shown us our seats.
Let's see... Hulot.
Where is he? Hulot!
Wait, I've seen him pass by.
He's here. Come here. Here.
- What is going on, Major?
- I am sorry, but my plan was drawn up a long time ago.
You must wait for Hulot's car.
But he isn't here.
This lady's giving you her seat. How nice.
Attention! Let's go.
No, I must stay to answer the telephone.
The renascent Lettrism will know which way to go!
No more formulas, but dynamism.
The legislature must give way to doctrinal inspiration.
In one word, capitalism talks too much and eclecticism will win out.
We can't get into that car, our dresses will be ruined.
Direction... north!
Let's be methodical.
No. Tinned food, this way.
Ah, some dessert. Put it there.
Look at this view.
This little village, the church - it's really "pretty as a picture" as you say in English.
Oh, I hadn't noticed that over there...
What's happening?
Did you see that?
I went up and down again.
At last we're moving!
Good, I'm feeling hungry.
Yes, I can hear you.
No, not seven. Sixteen loads.
Thank you.
I'll be delighted to see you in Paris.
For you, mademoiselle.
It will be a pleasure.
Such a delightful stay.
Awful journey. You can't imagine how hot it was in that plane.
Do telephone me as soon as you arrive.
Ah, the Major! Hello, Major.
Let me kiss you.
- Goodbye, have a safe journey back.
- Thank you.
- You will keep in touch?
- Certainly!
- Goodbye, monsieur.
- Goodbye.
And if you come near Sèvres, come to see us.
- You have my address?
- Yes, we do.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Come on, hurry up, here it comes.
Goodbye.
It was a pleasure to meet you.
Here's my address.
Goodbye.
Cinderella
You're as lovely as your name
Cinderella
You're a sunset in a frame
Though you're dressed in rags
You wear an air of queenly grace
Anyone can see
A throne would be your proper place
Cinderella
If you give your heart a chance
It will lead you
To the kingdom of romance
There you'll see your dreams unfold
Cinderella
In the sweetest story
Ever told
Once upon a time, in a faraway land, there was a tiny kingdom, peaceful, prosperous, and rich in romance and tradition.
Here, in a stately chateau, there lived a widowed gentleman and his little daughter, Cinderella.
Although he was a kind and devoted father, and gave his beloved child every luxury and comfort, still, he felt she needed a mother's care.
And so, he married again, choosing for his second wife a woman of good family, with two daughters just Cinderella's age, by name, Anastasia and Drizella.
It was upon the untimely death of this good man, however, that the stepmother's true nature was revealed.
Cold, cruel, and bitterly jealous of Cinderella's charm and beauty, she was grimly determined to forward the interests of her own two awkward daughters.
Thus, as time went by, the chateau fell into disrepair.
For the family fortunes were squandered upon the vain and selfish stepsisters, while Cinderella was abused, humiliated, and finally forced to become a servant in her own house.
And yet, through it all,
Cinderella remained ever gentle and kind.
For with each dawn, she found new hope that someday her dreams of happiness would come true.
Well, it serves you right, spoiling people's best dreams.
Yes, I know it's a lovely morning, but it was a lovely dream, too.
What kind of a dream?
Can't tell.
'Cause if you tell a wish, it won't come true.
And, after all...
A dream is a wish
Your heart makes
When you're fast asleep
In dreams you will lose
Your heartaches
Whatever you wish for
You keep
Have faith
In your dreams and someday
Your rainbow will come smiling through
No matter how your heart is grieving
If you keep on believing
The dream that you wish
Will come true
Oh, that clock.
Old killjoy.
I hear you. "Come on, get up," you say.
Time to start another day.
Even he orders me around.
Well, there's one thing.
They can't order me to stop dreaming.
And perhaps someday...
The dreams that I wish
Will come true
No matter how your heart is grieving
If you keep on believing
The dream that you wish
Will come true
- Look what I found.
- Over there, Cinderella.
Wait a minute.
One at a time, please.
Now, Jaq, what's all the fuss about?
New mouse in the house.
Brand-new. Never saw it before.
- Visitor. Visitor!
- Oh, a visitor.
Well, she'll need a dress...
- No, no, no.
- It's not a she, it's a he.
- He, he.
- Oh, that does make a difference.
- He'll need a jacket and shoes...
- Gotta get him out!
- It's in a rat trap.
- Where?
In a trap? Why didn't you say so?
Now, now, calm down, everybody.
Oh, the poor little thing's scared to death.
Jaq, maybe you better explain things to him.
Zuk, zuk, Cinderelly.
Now, now. Look, little guy.
Take it easy. Nothin' to worry about.
We like you. Cinderelly likes you, too.
She's nice, very nice.
That's better. Come on, now. Zuk, zuk.
Zuk, zuk.
Well, that's better.
Well, let's just slip it on for size.
It is a little snug.
But it'll have to do.
Now, for a name.
I've got one. Octavius.
But for short, we'll call you Gus.
Like it, Gus? Like it? Like it?
Gus-Gus.
I've got to hurry.
See he keeps out of trouble, Jaq.
And don't forget to warn him about the cat.
Zuk, zuk. Look, did you ever see a cat?
Cat, cat?
Cat, cat. Lucifer. That's him.
Meany, sneaky.
Jump at you. Bite at you.
Big, big. Big as a house.
Zuk, zuk, Lucify?
Lucify, zuk, zuk.
Here, kitty, kitty.
Come, kitty. Come on.
Lucifer! Come here!
I'm sorry if Your Highness objects to an early breakfast.
It's certainly not my idea to feed you first.
It's orders. Come on.
Lucify. Is that Lucify?
Zuk, Lucify. That's him.
Gus-Gus take the Lucify and look at!
No, Gus-Gus, no.
Now, listen here. Lucify not funny.
Lucify mean.
Bruno.
Bruno!
Dreaming again.
Chasing Lucifer?
Catch him this time? That's bad.
Suppose they heard you upstairs.
You know the orders.
So if you don't want to lose that nice, warm bed, you'd better get rid of those dreams.
Know how?
Just learn to like cats.
No, I mean it.
Lucifer has his good points, too.
For one thing, he...
Well, sometimes he...
There must be something good about him.
Bruno!
Oh, Bruno.
Come on, now. Outside.
I know it isn't easy, but at least we should try to get along together.
And that includes you, Your Majesty.
Breakfast time.
Everybody up. Hurry, hurry.
Come on, everybody, breakfast, breakfast.
Come on, let's eat breakfast.
Breakfast? Breakfast!
Lucify. How're we gonna get out?
Let's see.
Listen, ibby-dibby. Got an idea.
Now, somebody's got to sneak out, get Lucify to chase him, run over to the corner and keep Lucify there.
Then we all run out. Zuk.
Yuk, yuk. Out.
Now we choose the one to do it.
Ibby-dibby hop.
- Hop.
- Hop.
- Ready, hop.
- Hop.
Hop.
- Now...
- Hop, hop, hop.
Hop.
Oh, there you are.
I was wondering.
All right. Breakfast is served.
Take it easy, cluck-cluck.
Let go! Let go, now.
Stop that. Go on, shoo, shoo.
Shoo, shoo, shoo!
Poor little Gus.
Here.
Help yourself.
Where's Gus-Gus?
Well, guess he got away.
Cinderella!
All right, all right. I'm coming.
Oh, my goodness.
Morning, noon, and night.
Cinderella!
Coming, coming.
- Cinderella!
- I'm coming.
- Cinderella!
- In a minute.
Cinderella!
Good morning, Drizella. Sleep well?
As if you care.
Take that ironing and have it back in an hour.
One hour, you hear?
Yes, Drizella.
Good morning, Anastasia.
Well, it's about time.
Don't forget the mending.
Don't be all day getting it done, either.
Yes, Anastasia.
Well, come in, child, come in.
Good morning, Stepmother.
Pick up the laundry and get on with your duties.
Yes, Stepmother.
Oh, Mother. Oh, Mother!
Mother! Mother!
You did it. You did it on purpose.
Mother! Mother! Mother!
Now what did you do?
She put it there.
A big, ugly mouse, under my teacup.
All right, Lucifer.
What did you do with him?
Oh, you're not fooling anybody.
We'll just see about this.
Come on. Let him go.
Now the other one.
Come on!
Oh, poor little Gus.
Oh, Lucifer, won't you ever learn?
Cinderella!
Yes, Stepmother.
Are you gonna get it.
Close the door, Cinderella.
Come here.
- You don't think that I...
- Hold your tongue.
Now, it seems we have time on our hands.
- But I was only trying to...
- Silence!
Time for vicious practical jokes.
Perhaps we can put it to better use.
Now, let me see...
There's the large carpet in the main hall.
Clean it!
And the windows, upstairs and down.
Wash them!
Oh, yes.
And the tapestries and the draperies.
- But I just finished...
- Do them again!
And don't forget the garden.
Scrub the terrace.
Sweep the halls and the stairs.
Clean the chimneys.
And, of course, there's the mending and the sewing and the laundry.
Oh, yes. And one more thing.
See that Lucifer gets his bath.
My son has been avoiding his responsibilities long enough.
It's high time he married and settled down.
Of course, Your Majesty.
But we must be patient.
I am patient!
But I'm not getting any younger, you know.
I want to see my grandchildren before I go.
- I understand, Sire.
- No.
No, you don't know what it means to see your only child grow farther, farther, and farther away from you.
I'm...
I'm lonely in this desolate old palace.
I... I want to hear the pitter-patter of little feet again.
Now, now, Your Majesty.
- Perhaps if we just let him alone...
- Let him alone?
With his silly romantic ideas?
But, Sire, in matters of love...
Love.
Just a boy meeting a girl under the right conditions.
So, we're arranging the conditions.
But, Your Majesty, if the Prince should suspect.
Suspect!
Look, the boy's coming home today, isn't he?
Yes, Sire.
Well, what could be more natural than a ball to celebrate his return?
Nothing, Sire.
If all the eligible maidens in my kingdom just happened to be there, why, he's bound to show interest in one of them, isn't he?
Isn't he?
Yes, Sire.
The moment he does...
Soft lights.
Romantic music.
All the trimmings!
It can't possibly fail.
Can it?
Yes, Sire. No, Sire!
Very well, Sire.
I shall arrange the ball for...
- Tonight.
- Tonight? Tonight!
- Oh, but, Sire...
- Tonight!
And see that every eligible maid is there.
Understand?
Yes, Your Majesty.
The pear-shaped toad
Sing, sweet nightingale

Oh, sing, sweet nightingale
Sing, sweet nightingale

Oh, sing, sweet nightingale

Lucifer!
You mean old thing.
I'm just going to have to teach you a lesson.
Open in the name of the King.
An urgent message from His Imperial Majesty.
- Thank you.
- From the King!
What's it say, Cinderelly?
What's it say?
I don't know.
He said it's urgent.
Maybe I should interrupt the music lesson.
Sing, sweet nightingale
High
You clumsy! You did it on purpose.
- It's her fault.
- Girls, girls. Remember, above all, self-control.
Yes!
Cinderella!
I've warned you never to interrupt...
- This just arrived from the palace.
- From the palace!
- Give it here.
- Let me have it.
I'll read it.
Well, there's to be a ball.
- A ball!
- In honour of His Highness, the Prince.
Oh, the Prince!
And, by royal command, every eligible maiden is to attend.
- Why, that's us!
- And I'm so eligible.
That means I can go, too.
Her, dancing with the Prince.
I'd be honoured, Your Highness.
Would you mind holding my broom?
Well, why not?
After all, I'm still a member of the family.
And it says, "By royal command",
"every eligible maiden is to attend."
Yes, so it does.
Well, I see no reason why you can't go.
If you get all your work done.
Oh, I will. I promise.
And if you can find something suitable to wear.
I'm sure I can.
Oh, thank you, Stepmother.
Mother, do you realise what you just said?
Of course.
I said "if."
Oh. "If."
Isn't it lovely?
- It was my mother's.
- It's pretty, but it looks old.
Well, maybe it is old-fashioned, but I'll fix that.
- How do you do it?
- Wait a minute.
There ought to be some good ideas in here.
This one.
Oh, very nice. Nice.
- Like it.
- It'll be easy.
I'll have to shorten the sleeves,
I'll need a sash,
- a ruffle, something for a collar...
- Cinderella!
Oh, now what do they want?
Cinderella!
Oh, well.
I guess my dress will just have to wait.
Cinderella!
All right, all right. I'm coming.
Poor Cinderelly.
Every time she finds a minute, that's the time when they begin it.
Cinderelly, Cinderelly.
Cinderella!
Cinderelly, Cinderelly
Night and day it's Cinderelly
Make the fire
Fix the breakfast
Wash the dishes
Do the moppin'
And the sweepin' and the dustin'
They always keep her hoppin'
She'd go around in circles
Till she's very, very dizzy
- Still they holler
- Keep her busy, Cinderelly
Yeah. Keep her busy.
You know what?
- Cinderelly won't go to the ball.
- What?
- Not go?
- What did you say?
You'll see. They'll fix her.
Work, work, work.
She'll never get her dress done.
Poor Cinderelly.
Hey! We can do it!
We can do it
We can do it
We can help our Cinderelly
We can make the dress so pretty
There's nothing to it, really
We'll tie a sash around it
Put a ribbon through it
When dancing at the ball she'll be more beautiful than all
In the lovely dress we make for Cinderelly
Hurry, hurry, hurry
Gonna help our Cinderelly
Got no time to dilly-dally
We got to get it goin'
I'll cut it with the scissors.
And I can do the sewing.
Leave the sewing to the women.
You go get some trimmin'.
And we'll make a lovely dress for Cinderelly, whoo
We'll make a lovely dress for Cinderelly
Follow me, Gus-Gus.
I know where to go.
It's gonna be pretty, this dress.
Cinderelly will be surprised.
Surprised, surprised. Very surprised.
And this, too, my slippers.
Don't forget...
- Take my dress.
- Here, mend the buttonholes.
- Press my skirt and mind the ruffle.
- Cinderella?
- Yes?
- When you're through, and before you begin your regular chores,
I have a few little things.
Very well.
I don't see why everyone else has nice things to wear, and I always end up in these old rags.
This sash! I wouldn't be seen dead in it.
You should talk. These beads!
I am sick of looking at them.
- Trash.
- Oh, I hate this.
Come on and be careful.
Yes, yes, yes. Real careful.
We can use that, Gus-Gus.
Pretty, pretty.
Look out. Lucify!
Beads!
Very pretty beads!
A dream is a wish your heart makes
When you're fast asleep
In dreams you will lose your heartaches
Whatever you wish for
You keep
No matter how your heart is grieving
If you keep on believing
The dream that you wish will come true
Okay. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
Whatever you wish for you keep
All right.
Heave, ho. Heave, ho.
Heave, ho.
The dream that you wish will come true
Will come true
- Yes?
- The carriage is here.
Why, Cinderella,
- you're not ready, child.
- I'm not going.
Not going? Oh, what a shame.
But, of course, there will be other times.
Yes. Good night.
Oh, well.
What's a royal ball?
After all, I suppose it would be frightfully dull, and boring, and completely...
Completely wonderful.
- It's my...
- Surprise!
- Surprise!
- Surprise!
- Happy birthday!
- No, no, no, no!
Well, I never dreamed it.
It's such a surprise.
Oh, how can I ever...
Oh, thank you so much.
Remember, when you're presented to His Highness,
- be sure...
- Wait!
Please, wait for me.
Isn't it lovely? Do you like it?
Do you think it will do?
- Cinderella!
- Mother, she can't.
- Oh, no.
- You can't!
Girls, please.
After all, we did make a bargain.
Didn't we, Cinderella?
And I never go back on my word.
How very clever.
These beads, they give it just the right touch.
Don't you think so, Drizella?
No, I don't. I think she's...
Why, you little thief!
They're my beads. Give them here.
Oh, no.
And look, that's my sash.
She's wearing my sash.
- Mine!
- Oh, please.
Please, no.
Thief!
Girls, girls.
That's quite enough.
Hurry along now, both of you.
I won't have you upsetting yourselves.
Good night.
You will lose your heartache
Whatever you wish for
You'll keep
Oh, no. No, it isn't true.
Have faith in your dreams and someday
It's just no use.
Your rainbow will come smiling through
No use at all.
No matter how your heart is grieving
If you keep on believing
I can't believe. Not any more.
The dream that you wish
Will come true
There's nothing left to believe in.
Nothing.
Nothing, my dear?
- Oh, now you don't really mean that.
- Oh, but I do.
Nonsense, child!
If you'd lost all your faith,
I couldn't be here.
And here I am.
Oh, come now. Dry those tears.
You can't go to the ball looking like that.
The ball?
- Oh, but I'm not...
- Of course, you are.
But we have to hurry, because even miracles take a little time.
- Miracles?
- Watch.
What in the world did I do with that magic wand? I was sure...
Magic wand?
That's strange.
- I always...
- Then you must be...
Your fairy godmother? Of course.
Where is that wand? I...
Oh! I forgot.
I put it away.
Look at what she did.
How'd she do it?
Now, let's see.
I'd say the first thing you need is
- a pumpkin.
- A pumpkin?
Now the magic words.
Sala-gadoola-menchika-boo-la
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo
Put 'em together and what have you got?
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo
Sala-gadoola-menchika-boo-la
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo
It'll do magic
Believe it or not
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo
Now sala-gadoola means
Menchika-boolaroo
But the thing-a-ma-bob that does the job
Is bibbidi-bobbidi-boo
Sala-gadoola-menchika-boo-la
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo
Put 'em together and what have you got?
Bibbidi-bobbidi
Bibbidi-bobbidi Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo
Oh, looky.
Isn't it wonderful?
Oh, it's beautiful.
Yes, isn't it?
With an elegant coach like that, of course, we'll simply have to have
- mice!
- Mice?
Oh, this really is nice.
Why, we'll have a coach and four when we're through.
Just a wave of my stick and to finish the trick, bibbidi, bobbidi, boo.
Gracious, what did I do?
I was sure there were four.
There should be one more.
There you are.
Bibbidi, bobbidi, boo.
Oh, poor Lucifer.
Serves him right, I'd say. Now...
Where were we? Oh, goodness, yes.
You can't go to the ball without a horse.
Another one?
But tonight, for a change, you will handle the reins, and sit in the driver's seat, too.
For instead of a horse, you're the coachman, of course.
Bibbidi, bobbidi, boo.
That does it, I guess, except for...
Oh, yes!
The finishing touch. And, that's you.
Yes, Bruno, that's right, you'll be footman tonight.
Bibbidi, bobbidi, boo.
Well, well, hop in, my dear.
We can't waste time.
- But...
- No, don't try to thank me.
Oh, I wasn't... I mean, I do, but...
But, don't you think my dress...
Yes, it's lovely, dear.
Good heavens, child.
You can't go in that!
Now, let's see, dear.
Your size and the shade of your eyes.
Something simple, but daring, too.
Oh, just leave it to me.
What a gown this will be.
Bibbidi-bobbidi.
Bibbidi-bobbidi.
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.
Oh, it's a beautiful dress.
Did you ever see such a beautiful dress?
And, look, glass slippers.
Why, it's like a dream.
A wonderful dream come true.
Yes, my child.
But, like all dreams, well, I'm afraid this can't last forever.
You'll have only till midnight, and then...
Midnight? Thank you.
Now, now, now, just a minute.
You must understand, my dear, on the stroke of 12:00 the spell will be broken, and everything will be as it was before.
Oh, I understand, but it's more than I ever hoped for.
Bless you, my child.
I... Goodness me!
It's getting late.
Hurry up, dear. The ball can't wait.
Have a good time.
Dance, be gay.
Now, off you go.
You're on your way.
With a bibbidi-bobbidi
Bibbidi-bobbidi
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo
Princess Frederica
Eugenie de la Fontain.
Mademoiselle Augustina DuBois.
Daughter of General Pierre DuBois.
The boy isn't cooperating.
Mademoiselle Leonora
Mercedes de la Tour.
Daughter of Colonel and Madame de la Tour.
I can't understand it.
There must be at least one who'd make a suitable mother.
Sire.
A suitable wife.
Mademoiselles
Drizella and Anastasia Tremaine.
Daughters of Lady Tremaine.
I give up.
Even I couldn't expect the boy to...
Well, if I may say so,
Your Majesty, I did try to warn you, but you, Sire, are incurably romantic.
No doubt you saw the whole pretty picture in detail.
The young Prince bowing to the assembly.
Suddenly he stops. He looks up.
For, lo, there she stands.
The girl of his dreams.
Who she is or whence she came, he knows not, nor does he care, for his heart tells him that here, here is the maid predestined to be his bride.
A pretty plot for fairy tales, Sire.
But in real life, oh, no.
No! It was foredoomed to failure.
Failure, eh?
Take a look at that, you pompous windbag.
Who is she?
- You know her?
- No, Sire.
I've never seen her before.
That's one thing in her favour.
The waltz. Quick, the waltz!
Lights. The lights.
Failure, eh?
Well... Now for a good night's sleep.
Oh, quite so, Sire. I believe I, too...
You will stay right here.
See they're not disturbed, and when the boy proposes, notify me immediately.
Notify me immediately.
And remember, if anything goes wrong...
- Who is she, Mother?
- Do we know her?
Well, the Prince certainly seems to.
I know I've never seen her.
Nor I.
But she certainly is... Wait.
There is something familiar about her.
Ahem.
So this is love
So this is what makes life
Divine
I'm all aglow
- And now I know
- And now I know
The key to all Heaven
Is mine
My heart has wings
And I can fly
I'll touch every star
In the sky
So this is the miracle
That I've been dreaming of
So this
Is
Love
Oh. Oh, my goodness.
What's the matter?
It's midnight.
Yes, so it is. But why...
- Goodbye.
- No, no, wait.
- You can't go now. It's only...
- Oh, I must. Please.
- Please, I must.
- But why?
Well, I... Oh, the Prince,
I haven't met the Prince.
The Prince?
But didn't you know...
- Goodbye.
- No, wait.
Come back. Please come back.
I don't even know your name.
How will I find you?
Wait! Please wait.
Goodbye.
Oh, I say. Young lady.
- Wait!
- The Prince!
Just a moment.
Guard! Guard!
Stop that coach! Close those gates!
Follow that coach!
Open those gates!
I'm sorry.
I guess I forgot about everything.
Even the time, but...
But it was so wonderful.
And he was so handsome, and when we danced...
Oh, I'm sure even the Prince himself couldn't have been more...
More...
- Oh, well, it's over and...
- Cinderelly.
Look, look! The slippers!
Yeah, your slipper.
Your slipper, Cinderelly.
Thank you.
Thank you so much, for everything.
Your Majesty,
I see no point in beating about the bush.
I regret to inform you, Sire, that the young lady has disappeared, leaving behind only this glass slipper.
Yes. I'll do it.
No. I just can't.
Well, come in.
Come in!
- Your Majesty...
- So, he's proposed already?
- Tell me about it.
- Well...
- Who is she?
- I didn't get a chance...
No matter. We've more important things to discuss.
Arrangements for the wedding, invitations, a national holiday.
- All that sort of thing.
- But, Sire...
Here. Have a cigar. Take a few more.
But...
Better practise passing these out, eh?
But, if you'd only listen.
And for you, my friend.
- Your Majesty, please...
- A knighthood.
I hereby dub you Sir...
By the way, what title would you like?
- Sire? She got away.
- Sir "She Got Away"?
A peculiar title, but if that's what you...
She what? Why, you...
You... You traitor!
Now, Sire.
Remember, your blood pressure.
Treason!
No, Sire. No!
Sabotage!
You were in league with the Prince.
I tried to stop her, but she vanished into thin air.
A likely story.
But it's true, Sire.
All we could find was this glass slipper.
The whole thing was a plot!
But, Sire, he loves her.
He won't rest till he finds her.
He's determined to marry her.
What? What did you say?
The Prince, Sire, swears he'll marry none but the girl who fits this slipper.
He said that, did he?
We've got him!
But, Sire, this slipper may fit one of any number of girls.
That's his problem. He's given his word.
- We'll hold him to it.
- No, Your Highness.
I'll have nothing to do with it.
You'll try this on every maid in my kingdom.
And if the shoe fits, bring her in.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Cinderella? Cinderella?
- Cinderella! Where is that...
- Yes?
Here I am.
My daughters, where are they?
I think they're still in bed.
Don't just stand there!
Bring up the breakfast trays at once.
And hurry!
I wonder what's the matter.
What's the matter with her?
I don't know. Let's find out. Come on.
Drizella. Drizella!
What?
Get up. Quick. This instant.
We haven't a moment to lose.
Anastasia.
Get up, Anastasia.
What for? Why?
Everyone's talking about it, the whole kingdom.
- Hurry now. He'll be here any minute.
- Who will?
The Grand Duke.
He's been hunting all night.
- Hunting?
- For that girl.
The one who lost her slipper at the ball last night.
They say he's madly in love with her.
- The Duke is?
- No, no, no. The Prince!
The Prince!
You clumsy little fool.
Clean that up, then help my daughters dress.
What for?
If he's in love with that girl, why should we even bother?
Now, you two, listen to me.
There is still a chance that one of you can get it.
One of us?
Why, Mother, what do you mean?
Just this:
No one, not even the Prince, knows who that girl is.
We know! We know! Cinderelly!
The glass slipper is their only clue.
The Duke has been ordered to try it on every girl in the kingdom.
And if one can be found whom the slipper fits, then, by the King's command, that girl shall be the Prince's bride.
- His bride.
- His bride!
Cinderella, get my things together.
Never mind her. Get mine right away.
What's the matter with her?
- Wake up, stupid.
- We've gotta get dressed.
Dressed. Oh, yes.
Oh, we must get dressed.
It wouldn't do for the Duke to see me...
Mother, did you see what she did?
- Are you just going to let her...
- Quiet!
So this is love
What's she gonna do?
I don't know. Gotta watch.
Come on.
- Cinderelly!
- Cinderelly!
So this is the miracle
That I've been dreaming of
What?
Oh, no!
No, please!
Oh, you can't, you just can't.
Let me out! You must let me out!
You can't keep me in here!
Oh, please.
No, no. She can't do it.
She can't lock up Cinderelly.
I'm gonna...
Please. Please.
We gotta get that key, Gus-Gus.
We just gotta get that key.
He's over here, the Duke-Duke.
- Yeah, yeah. Who?
- The Grand Duke, with the slipper.
We gotta get that key quick.
Yup, yup. Key, key. Quick.
Oh, Mother, Mother, he's here, he's here.
- The Grand Duke.
- Do I look all right?
- I'm so excited, I don't know what I'll do.
- Girls.
Now, remember, this is your last chance. Don't fail me.
Announcing
His Imperial Grace, the Grand Duke.
You honour our humble home.
Quite so.
May I present my daughters,
Drizella, Anastasia.
Your Grace.
Yes. Charmed, I'm sure.
His Grace will read the royal proclamation.
"All loyal subjects of His Imperial Majesty"
"are hereby notified by royal proclamation in regard to a certain"
"glass slipper."
"It is decreed..."
Why, that's my slipper!
Well, I like that. It's my slipper!
No, no, no! It's Cinderelly's slipper!
- How can she stand there...
- Girls.
Your manners.
A thousand pardons, Your Grace.
Please continue.
Yes, quite so.
Oh, yes.
"It is upon this day decreed"
"that a quest be instituted throughout..."
"The sole and express purpose of such quest to be as follows:"
"That every maid throughout the kingdom without exception,"
"shall try on her foot this slipper of glass,"
"and should one be found upon whose foot this slipper shall properly fit,"
"such maiden shall be acclaimed the object of this search"
"and shall be looked upon as the true love of His Royal Highness,"
"our beloved son and heir, the noble Prince."
"Said Prince will, upon bended knee"
"beg, request, or if need be, implore"
"said maiden that he be granted her hand in marriage."
"Whereupon, should the aforementioned maiden"
"look with favour, shall the couple pledge their troth..."
"And in due course, upon the inevitable demise of His Majesty the King,"
"succeed to the throne to rule over the land"
"as King and Queen of our kingdom."
"So be it."
You must be quite fatigued, Your Grace.
May we offer you some tea?
What? Tea?
Thank you, madam, no.
We must proceed with the fitting.
Of course. Anastasia, dear.
There. I knew it was my slipper.
Exactly my size.
I always wear the same size.
As soon as I saw it, I said...
Oh, well...
It may be a trifle snug today.
You know how it is, dancing all night.
I can't understand why.
It's always fit perfectly before.
I don't think you're half trying.
Mother, can you...
Quiet, my dear.
We mustn't disturb His Grace.
Young man, are you sure you're trying it on the right foot?
Oh, it's the right foot, but...
These glass shoes aren't always reliable.
Come on, hurry.
Up the stairs, up the stairs!
Lucify, Lucify.
Up, up, up with it.
Here.
Why can't you hold still a minute?
My word. Enough of this!
The next young lady, please.
Did you hear that, Gus?
- Yup.
- Gotta hurry.
Come on, come on, hurry.
Gus-Gus, Gus-Gus, come on.
Look, look. Just up there. Come on.
Us is coming, Cinderelly.
- I can get you out.
- You've got the key!
How did you ever manage to...
Lucifer!
Let him go, Lucifer.
Please, let him go.
- Let him go.
- Let him go!
Let him go. Let him out, you hear?
Lucify, you...
Bruno. Yes, Bruno!
Quick, get Bruno. Get Bruno!
Of all the stupid little idiots.
I'll do it myself.
Get away from me.
I'll make it fit.
- There.
- It fits.
It fits?
No!
Oh, Your Grace, I'm dreadfully sorry.
It shan't happen again.
Precisely, madam.
Come on, come on.
Get up, Gus-Gus, get up.
Don't, don't, don't, don't.
Let go, let go.
You are the only ladies in the household I hope... I presume.
- There's no one else, Your Grace.
- Quite so.
- Good day. Good day.
- Your Grace?
Your Grace, please, wait.
May I try it on?
- Pay no attention.
- It's Cinderella.
- From the kitchen.
- Ridiculous.
She's out of her mind.
Just an imaginative child.
Madam, my orders were "every maiden."
Come, my child.
Oh, no.
No, no, no. Oh, no!
Oh, this is terrible.
The King, what will he say?
What will he do?
Perhaps, if it would help...
No, no. Nothing can help now. Nothing.
But, you see, I have the other slipper.
Have faith in dreams
And someday
Your rainbow will come smiling through
No matter how your heart is grieving
If you keep on believing
The dream that you wish
Will come true
Heidi! Get up!
I'll be right there.
Good morning, grandfather.
So, are you satisfied now?
The weather is beautiful.
The wind changed during the night.
The sky was full of stars.  
Now go and get washed.
Otherwise the sun will be laughing at you.  
Yes, yes.
Heidi!
I just wanted to say ...
You wanted to say 'good morning'?
No, I wanted to...
Good morning, Alp-hi!  
- What do you want?
- Do you have to stay at home now?  
- Do I? Who says so?
- The pastor said it.  
- I'm ready!
- Do you have cheese and bread?  
You're always thinking about food.
Go now!  
And don't come home too late.
Hey, Alp-hi!
Nobody told you anything?
What? That you were coming?
I need to discuss something with you.
No time.
I have to work.  
I was preparing my sermon on the way.
So?
Is it about charity?  
No, about patience.
- Luke 21, 19.
- Why?  
Isn't it written: 'In your patience ye shall win your souls'?  
Yes, yes.
May help you a bit?
Surely that's not why you've come up here.  
Doesn't matter.
So what do you want?
You have beautiful grass.
- Well, I'm here with a request.
- With a request?  
The new bells will be raised Saturday after next.  
The children do it, as is the custom.  
Your grandchild is one of them.
Will you bring her down?  
Heidi does not like to go down to the village.  
But in fall she will have to go to school anyway.  
She should have gone last year already.
No more excuses this time.
Who says so?
The law.
I was given the child two years ago.  
At that time, no one asked if I wanted the child.  
And now I decide what's to be done with her.  
You wouldn't start a fight with the board of education?  
They should leave my Heidi in peace, she likes to be with me.  
Here, take this.
Shall we?
It's far to go up there!
You promised that we would go on the next sunny day. This is today.  
I want to see where the stream comes from.  
We'll get a huge hunger if we go up any further.  
- I have some food left.
- But I have nothing left.  
You can have the cheese.
And the piece of sausage?
You'll get that too, but only once we reach the top.  
I'm sorry, you can't have the piece of sausage anymore.  
But are we really going? Word of honor?
- If I say so.
- Hush! Look.  
I know what you want of me, Father.
Please sit down.
You think these bells can just ring in the reconciliation?  
That's why you came to me and not because of Heidi.  
That's what I thought.
Why not? When I moved into the village, the misfortune had already happened.  
But the others?!
They claim that I did not quench the fire in that windy night.  
Out of arrogance and ruthlessness.
The embers supposedly sparked out of my chimney.  
And I was to blame that 5 houses and the church tower burned down.  
- Do you want some cider?
- Why not?  
And yet I can swear that I did not even have a fire going that night.  
If only I had let the other houses burn.  
But I was the first one trying to put the fire out. Me and my son.  
He was killed while trying to extinguish it.  
Six months later his wife,
Heidi's mother, died out of grief.  
Do you think I can simply forget?
And after all that, they pursued me in justice!  
I had enough of these neighbors.
That's why I came up here.  
Believe it or not, but
I am as innocent as Job.  
Without any misdeed. Innocent.
And here you think that
I'll go to church on Sundays?  
It would not bother me.
Even if a biblical man like yourself has no need for it.  
- Think it over again...
- There is nothing to think over!  
Just do it for the child!
- Goodbye, Alp-hi. The cider was good.
- Goodbye.  
Here, now we are on top.
Give me my sausage.  
But we can go still further up.
Higher up there's only rocks.
You can see that.  
- And we can't climb up?
- No.  
- Why not?
- Because there's only rocks.  
- And where does the stream begin?
- This is the source.  
- Then where's the beginning of the source?
- Give it a rest!  
There, on the top of the ridge is also a small lake.  
- Have you ever seen it?
- Sure!  
- So you can go up further!
- Will you promise me...  
...that I'll get some of the sausage?
- But are we really going?
- Yes, we're going!  
Here it is:
The beginning of the source!  
Let's go to the lake.
How beautiful it is up here.
- Where does the water come from?
- From the sky.  
But you won't make me go up there,
I'm telling you right now.  
Where are we here?
At Echo Ridge. Listen:
Little swan, little bear!
- Grandfather!
- Heidi!  
Stupid pig-cat!
You made the echo angry.
Give me your hand.  
Let us sing something.
But a beautiful song.  
The brook flows into the village.
And where does the water flow then?  
Into the Rhine.
And the Rhine?  
- Into Lake Constance.
- And it stays there?  
- I don't know.
- Who knows then?  
- The teacher. He knows it from books.
- Can't you read them?  
- Not those.
- Why not?  
You're so nosey!
Come on, let's go.  
You have to know what you want:
Either you learn how to read, or...  
... you can go up to the mountain.
You can't do both.  
Then I don't want to learn how to read. Never!  
I'm sure the pastor means well.
But we two don't want to have anything to do with the villagers.  
Are the bells heavy?
It depends on the size.
Can the children even carry them?
Yes, if they work together.
And if a child is sick?
Then another one takes its place.
But if all are there already, there's nobody left who can stand in.  
Shouldn't we go down after all?
We could wait around.
We'll see.
Thanks, Grandfather!
Shall I sing something?  
Yes.
- Hey mother, it's starting.
- Alright, then go.  
I'm going to the village.
Are you sure you don't want to step inside?  
When it's over, I'll knock at the door and wait here.  
Hello.
Heidi! So you made it?
I can help with the bell. But grandfather said someone must go with me.  
I see!
Close the store already.
We want to be there when our boys arrive.  
He could have come for the entire day!
Let the people talk.
The hens can't do it!
That's right!
What is right?! How dare you!
Let him go.
One should take away the child.
He'll get what's coming to him yet.
Nobody will help him then.  
All children to the rope.
But lift the rope only once the bell founder says so.  
Lift the rope!
What's wrong with that little one?
You don't want to join in?  
It belongs to Alp-hi.
Come, you're part of it as well.
Come on, pull!
There's enough for all.
All will get a chance.  
- Did you also get a sausage?
- Yes.  
- But Brigitte, this is white bread.
- This is a soft roll.  
- Do you want some?
- A little, but the rest is yours.  
My late husband used to bring me white bread every Saturday.  
Didn't it get hard?
Later in the week I roasted it...
... on the fire.
- If I had money, I'd buy you...  
- ... white bread daily.
- I can live without it.  
- Are you coming to see us?
- Welcome!  
Brigitte, your house looks run down.  
Grandfather! I got a sausage and was allowed to pull too.  
I know!
- Do you live...?
- Peter and I live here.  
- And in the chambers up there?
- We can't, the roof is broken.  
Don't you know how to use a hammer and nails?  
Nobody will show him, how.
I have to climb up every day with the goats.  
Someone else would have to do it.
Why don't you take someone in the two chambers over winter.  
- I could do that.
- I mean for a fee, of course.  
Of course. I think I know now what you mean.  
You do. That's good.
Goodbye.  
Come, Heidi.
Get home safely.
Heidi, come on!
We have a visitor.
Your aunt from Frankfurt.  
- Yes?
- Go see her at once.  
She has been waiting for 2 hours.
She's upstairs.
She also brought you something.
Look at that! Heidi, how much you have grown!  
Give me your hand.
I hope you remember me?  
- You're Aunt Dete.
- So, you have not forgotten me then.  
I brought you a dress.
Go ahead, unpack it!  
Yes. Thank you.
But why would you deny her happiness?
You only get such an opportunity once in a lifetime.  
The child stays here.
But then my trip from Frankfurt would have been completely useless.  
For the last time:
The child does not belong in the city.  
I see. And what gives you the right to decide that?  
I took her in, back then.
And I was entrused with
Heidi by my late sister.  
At that time you didn't have a bad conscience.  
But now, after two years...
I had just obtained a position and could not take care of her.  
But now it is high time for a good education.  
In the house there's 2 bathrooms, a governess, and electricity.  
And you can eat for example chicken or venison even on weekdays.  
- I'm sure she'll get a good deal.
- Stop this nonsense!  
Make a decision. It's urgent.
Lord Sesemann is going to America in a few days.  
That's why he can't leave his daughter Klara alone.  
Just imagine, she always has to sit in her chair.  
You only ever think of yourself.
That's why you're feuding with everybody.  
That's enough. Get out!
Good. I'm leaving on my own.
I won't be sent away. Adieu!  
She never received such a nice dress in her life.  
That's ok.
She is also a good kid.  
I must go now.
Unfortunately I can't stay here.  
Do you want to accompany me for a bit?
- I don't know.
- Of course, just go.  
That way we can at least spend a moment together.  
Come!
- Adieu.
- Have a good trip.  
Listen, Heidi. Are you sure you don't want to come with me?  
Where to?
To the train station, by car.
I need to ask Grandfather first.
Nonsense.
Just come with me.  
We could surprise him.
You could buy him something.  
What? A tobacco pipe?
Yes, that way for once you'll have a present for him.  
Oh yes! But then we have to hurry.
Heidi?!
Where are you going?  
To the train station with my aunt.
When will Heidi come back?
Right thereafter.
From the train station?
Who says they're going to the station?
Heidi. Just now.
For God's sake.
Alp-hi! Alp-hi!  
Heidi!
You won't find a pipe down here.
What do we do now?
You can get pipes where
I come from. In Frankfurt.  
Is it far?
Heidi!
Heidi!
Heidi!
Why don't you go there with me?
I know you'll love it.  
But will I be back home tonight?
Why?
Otherwise Grandfather will be worried.
But Grandfather would be happy to let you see something new.  
But will I be back tomorrow?
Come with me. And if you want to, you can be back very quickly.  
Just do everything as I told you.
- And what's that...?
- Psst! No time for questions.  
There you are.
Good evening, Sebastian.
Is that all?  
- This is my niece.
- Then go in, you are expected.  
Johann, pick up Lord Sesemann only after 11 o'clock.  
Good night.
Good evening, Miss Klara.
Good evening, Miss Rottenmeyer.  
I do apologize, the train was late.  
I am very grateful that the car could wait that long.  
Otherwise everything went fine.
Now, give everyone your hand.  
- Hello.
- So this is the child, Dete?  
Step closer, girl.
What's your name?  
The Miss asked about your name. Tell her.  
Heidi.
What kind of name is that?
That can't be right.  
It's the name of her late mother, Adelheid.  
I dare say. How old are you?
8 years.
8 years?
That's impossible.  
Is it true, Dete?
It can't really be verified...
...come with me.
Sebastian. Give the child some soup in the meantime.  
Are you Klara?
That's my name.
Is this a car?
Do you drive it around the house?  
Do you understand what she means?
Every word. She says she's hungry.
No wonder after such a long trip.
Come, sit down.  
Some bread?
That's white bread.
May I have this?  
Excuse me?
I want to bring it to Brigitte.
Of course.
We need a child that can study with Miss Klara.  
Lord Sesemann will decide tomorrow.  
He'll send the child back.
For God's sake.  
Prepare the room for the little one.  
You may serve the dessert.
Are you from the railway too?
There was a man with a big bag, he had the same beautiful buttons.  
What did she say?
That sounds so funny.  
It's all very funny.
Leave us, I will ring the bell.  
Do you like it?
I don't taste anything.
What do you mean?
But enough of that.  
Even if you stay here only briefly: in this house there are rules.  
One moment, Klara,
I'm almost done.  
The man who just walked out is a servant.  
One does not converse with them.
Remember this.
What are you doing?  
- Adding Mocken.
- "Mocken"? Who does that?  
The grandfather.
Klara, this is not a reason to laugh.  
You are here in Ludwig Sesemann's house, not on the goose pasture.  
I must also ask you to converse in High German.  
The language of educated people.
Education is the harmonious development of forces that make us happy.  
But I hardly expect a country girl to understood this.  
Certainly not.
That's the limit.
She is tired, Miss Rottenmeyer.
One must be able to control oneself.
And now this naughty creature just falls asleep at the table.  
Sebastian, get Tinette. She shall put the child to bed.  
We must act quickly. Fortunately your father only leaves tomorrow.  
So, get up, get washed and get dressed.
Quickly. The ladies and gents are already at breakfast.  
- Where is Aunt Dete?
- In the kitchen.  
The little girl will be here shortly.
Good. Then you can see what kind of situation we must cope with.  
Now, give the child... what's her name, anyway?  
Heidi.
- We shall call her Adelheid.
- I like "Heidi".  
Give the child some time to get used to it.  
- Klara, how do you like Heidi?
- I find her quite funny.  
Funny is always good.
I am responsible.
I understand, you want to send Heidi back immediately.  
Frankly...
The girl stays here.
If she's really no match for Klara,
I will leave the decision to my mother.
She is coming in a few weeks.
Do you understand?  
My mother alone will decide whether to keep her or send her back.  
I understand
Lord Sesemann.  
Doctor Classen.
Why don't you start with the lessons, Miss Rottenmeyer?  
How nice that you came.
Have you had breakfast?  
Come with me, I need to tell you something.  
I will be away for half a year.
Do whatever you can to help Klara.
Above all, be energetic.
The Rottenmeyer is too petty.  
Unfortunately, Klara has been very passive since the Diphtheria episode.  
I will do my best.
You can leave reassured.  
I am under no illusions.
Perhaps Klara will never walk again.  
Nevertheless, you will understand...
Ah. Our Swiss child.
- Hello.
- Come, sit down with us.  
This is the little girl I had brought here. Did you sleep well?  
Would you like milk or chocolate?  
Milk.
Like you're used to from the pasture.
There's also bread and butter.  
Are you the Lord Sesemann?
No, I am.
That's the nice doctor.  
- What are your mountains called?
- Echo Ridge and...  
Oh? I don't know that one.
- Will you join me? I have to leave.
- I can spare a few minutes.  
Heidi, go over there once you've finished your milk. Alright?  
Come in!
Can not you come when you are called?  
And one does not take one's unfinished breakfast to school.  
Sit down. Starting tomorrow we shall begin promptly at 9 o'clock.  
Oh?
Where is Aunt Dete?  
Here, no questions are asked, especially not in Swiss German.  
We shall now examine you.
Here, read this.
Oh, you don't want to?
No.
And why not?
I'd rather be on the mountain.
Nonsense. Now read.
- I can't read.
- What?  
Heidi, is this true?
You really can't read?  
No. Peter the goat herd can't either.
Hey Klara, may I bring one of those pipes to my grandfather?  
What about the grandfather?
Leave the things where they are and sit down.  
How can Lord Sesemann expect me to teach under these circumstances!  
Why don't we do something else?
Yes. Read your essay, Klara.
The lightning rod. It is desirable at all times to divert the lightning...  
... as it is capable of inflicting great harm to humans and animals alike---  
Adelheid, stop that.
Dad wants that we call her Heidi.
Read on.
Nowadays, man has tamed the electric force by installing lightning rods---  
A bird, a bird!
Why is it in a cage?  
Back to your seat, Adelheid!
Why isn't it allowed outside?
But Heidi, so it doesn't get eaten by the cat.  
Why? It can fly away.
Quiet!
What do you want?
Can't you speak?
Why not?  
I see! So Miss Rottenmeyer forbid you to speak with me?  
Don't take that so seriously.
Shall I open the window?  
Well? What can you see?
Nothing but houses.
Yes, Frankfurt is a big city. You can see everything from the attic.  
Don't worry, Miss Rottenmeyer is out of the house.  
Can you see the mountains from there?
For that you need to climb higher still. Come here!  
And hop! Look. This is our cathedral.
Can you see the mountains from there?
Definitely.
But I've never been up there.
Now you must go back to your room.  
Postcards, ladies and gentlemen.
Careful. Don't be in such a hurry.
Close the door.
We do not need spectators.  
Straight into the study, Johann.
Is Heidi upstairs?  
Yes.
H e i d i ! Heidi! Heidi!
The little girl is nowhere to be found.
I even looked in the attic.  
Why should she be there?
Tinette, come here!  
Lord Sesemann has barely left, and the child elopes already!  
The child does not elope.
You may have frightened it.  
Off to the kitchen with you!
- Where's Heidi?
- Klara, please stay in the room.  
One should search the streets.
Tinette, go and locate the child.
Yes, at once.
- It may be better if I went.
- You stay here.  
I'll show you the way home.
I know the Sesemann's house.  
Don't be so downcast.
I had to scold a little.  
But to make up, I'll show you something nice. Come!  
Something has happened to the child.
There must have been an accident.  
Hopefully she was only hit by a bike, not a car.  
- Or even by a van.
- Don't think such things...  
Sebastian!
Go and search for the child!
This is the best thing to do.
Thank God, there you are.
You don't need to say a word.  
I know exactly where you were.
But don't tell Miss Rottenmeyer that we were in the attic.  
The little one is here.
Adelheid, come here.
Where have you been?  
On the tower.
Tower? On what tower?
From the cathedral.
From the cathedral?
How did you get that idea?
You better say it.
You don't want to talk?
What did you do on the tower?  
I was looking for the mountains.
Mountains?
And so you know it. Even if it's very far: I want to go home.  
But Heidi, we specially sent for you.
You think you can just leave?
Yes, that's what she promised.
Who did?
My aunt.
Is that true?
Yes. She said I could go back home if I don't like it here.  
And I don't like it here.
There's no goats and no mountains.  
I want to go to grandfather!
I see that you can talk when you want to...  
Are you making fun of me?
No, but ...
Silence! I don't want to hear any more. Even my patience has limits.  
In the corner!
Come in.
Just at the right time!
Your niece, this naughty...  
Oh! Sebastian!
Get that animal out of here!  
What a cute kitten.
Kill it!
No, don't kill it!
Be quiet. I'll hide it somewhere.
I know you won't betray me.  
You lied to her. Why did you say she could go back home?  
I only meant well.
In fact, I would love to send her home.
- Then do so.
- I can't do that.  
I must wait until the grandmother comes here.  
- My hands are tied.
- What luck!  
But you'll be fired, I can guarantee that!
Then I'll leave. But I'm warning you.
Cooks are much sought after these days.  
Then go back where you belong!
I forbid you to see your niece!  
You poor child.
They want to separate us.  
You lied.
I want to go home to grandfather.  
But then I'll be alone again!
Papa said I'd have a friend.  
Please stop that!
I'm only human!  
You are trying my nerves
We begin with geography.
Last time, we stopped with the river Main.  
Klara, what do you know about it?
The Main is 323 miles long.
It also carries ships.  
And what about the "Rii"?
Does it end in Lake Constance?  
Oh I see, you mean the Rhine.
Klara, what is the difference between a river and a lake?  
A river flows into the sea.
Does the Rhine flow into the sea?
Say this sentence in High German:
"Does the Rhine flow into the sea?"  
Does the Rhine flow into the sea?
Good!
This question is to be answered in the affirmative.  
And then?
Then the water evaporates and returns as rain or snow.  
Miss Rottenmeyer!
What now?
I have already been where the water begins.  
There is also a small lake, near the Echo Ridge.  
When you shout something there, it is repeated three times.  
Whatever.
Please let Heidi talk:
Are there any flowers there?  
No, not up there. But next to the cabin, further down.  
Gentian, alpine roses, lobelia...
How do you know all this?
From grandfather. He has two goats.
You can see the mountains from the cabin.  
And sometimes we sing together in front of the cabin.  
I only I could walk... I'd love to see that.
But maybe you can.
Give it a try!  
For Heaven's sake, no!
Stop this nonsense.  
Shall I sing a song?
- No.
- Please do.  
May I return to grandfather when Mrs. Sesemann gets here?  
I already explained why that's not possible.  
A man would like to see
Miss Klara personally.  
Let him in!
Good day.
See what I have for you.  
Are they all for me?
Sebastian! Sebastian!
Help!  
I would love to keep them all.
Have you gone crazy? Miss
Rottenmeyer's afraid of cats.  
Heidi said that there was space here and Klara wanted something to play.  
The cats all have to leave the house.
Including the kitten from yesterday.  
Sebastian!
There is something under my skirts.
Not possible. Where?
I don't see anything.
This Heidi.
Don't worry. These animals will leave the house.  
I will write to Mrs. Sesemann at once. Heidi must leave.  
I try to be objective.
Heidi is not unintelligent.  
But she just does not fit into the house.  
She can't even read.
And doesn't want to learn.  
This is worrysome indeed.
Exactly. And therefore it would be best if...  
...you brought Heidi to me.
As you wish.
Klara?
Grandma, please don't send Heidi away.
It's much nicer since she is here.
I don't even mind the wheelchair.
And even the teaching goes by faster.
You happy child. In my day, time seemed to stand still at school.  
Heidi. I hope you remember what I told you yesterday.  
You will address Mrs.
Sesemann as "gracious Madam".  
I know.
If she asks whether you want to go home, you tell the truth.  
What is that?
They're mine!
So, here's our little guest.
Good evening Mrs... Madam Gracious.
How are you.
But I am not a ''gracious
Madam.'' Just call me grandma.  
Look, I found these rolls in the little girl's closet.  
- Rolls.
- She wants to take them to her village.  
But Heidi, hard as these are, they're no good to anybody.  
Yes they are. Brigitte roasts them over the fire.  
That is very reasonable.
Listen, Heidi, won't you learn how to read? Why not?  
Peter the goat herd said: 'You're not allowed on the mountain if you can read.'  
Then he lied to you.
Really?
- Yes. May I read you a story aloud?
- Oh please do, grandma!  
Give me the little book.
- This one?
- Yes.  
Miss Rottenmeyer, you may also listen.  
Do you want to hear the story of the wise shepherd?  
A long time ago there lived a shepherd.
He was very clever.  
One day the King, wearing his golden crown, passed him and asked:  
''Can you answer me 3 questions?
I will reward you abundantly.  
How many stars are in the sky?''
The shepherd said:  
"Send out your servants and let them count the grains of sand on the beach."  
Hence infinitely many.
The King asked: How long does it take it to ride around the earth?  
- And what did the shepherd answer?
- I do not know.  
If the sun is always right above you, it takes exactly 24 hours.  
And the King's last question:
"How long does eternity last?"  
The shepherd thought and said:
"Somewhere is a very high mountain."  
Higher than the Echo Ridge?
Higher than all the mountains in the world put together.  
Every 1000 years comes a bird that whets its beak on it.  
And when the mountain is worn away, one second of eternity will have past. "  
Did you like the story?
Yes.
This book is full of stories. Don't you want to be able to read them?  
You should be able to read when you go home again.  
If I could only read already.
Here is another letter.
From Frankfurt.  
Who says so?
The mother.
She saw the postmark.  
And you should visit us again someday.
- This is for you.
- Thank you.  
- Is the letter from that aunt?
- No.  
From whom then?
From a Mrs. Sesemann, the grandmother of the sick child.  
Alp-hi, is Heidi coming back home soon?
No. The woman writes...
...read it yourself.  
I'm not curious.
What does she write?  
That she is fine and feels right at home.  
She can even read very well already.
Then I'm off.
Alp-hi, does this mean...
Heidi has forgotten us.
Now we must forget her too.  
But if Heidi does not go to the pasture with me in the springtime...  
... then I say, the whole world can...!
Now I have all the dresses together.
Do you like them, Klara?
Not bad.
She looks like a fine
Miss out of town.  
I also have concerns with my daughter.  
I'll put on the spring dress.
It will soon be time for it.  
Children, Johann wants to say something.  Tell the children.  
It's about the horse.
It still has no name.  
And since Lord Sesemann returns soon, the matter is urgent.  
Maybe the misses can think of an appropriate name.  
If you know a nice name, you can go visit it.  
I know something.
There's this story of a white horse in grandmother's book.  
Early in the morning,
Scrooge went to the barn.  
He saddled his horse, Astrid.
I think Astrid is a beautiful name.
I would have never thought of it.
A purely Germanic name.
Miss Klara, you will see how pretty the horse is.  
Sweet little horsey.
Now you can see Astrid.
I'll be back later.  
Can you see it?
More or less.
Come, Astrid. I can caress her skin. It is very soft.  
Klara!
You can stand?
I'll call Johann.
No, stay! I can't believe it. Is it true?  
I must try it again.
Does it hurt?
Why are you crying?
I can stand.
I can't sleep.
If I can stand, I should be able to walk.  
Are you OK?
Yes.
Do you think I can walk to the table?
Definitely.
You can walk.
But it makes me very tired.
Let's try again tomorrow.
No, then you can visit me.
What was that?
- Something fell in Klara's room.
- This is not possible.  
How do I get back to bed?
I'll help you.
Oh!
Tinette, Sebastian, Dete.
Call a doctor. Quickly.  
You receive me as if I were a prince.
Our Swiss child is here too.
Hello. I brought you something.  
Bring up the packages.
- You'll have a drink with me?
- Of course.  
- Is my daughter already asleep?
- No, Lord Sesemann.  
Then she must be expecting me.
My God!
Dad.
Klara! Is that possible?
You are coming towards me?  
I can walk again.
And you bring me home without saying a word!
Pinch me in the nose, so that I can believe it.  
You don't need to carry me anymore!
It's too bad that Mrs.
Sesemann cannot see this.  
Why did nobody write me about this?
I only found out recently.
And we wanted to surprise you.  
And you have succeeded.
Be careful, Klara.  
How did you manage that?
The little girl has helped me a lot.
- Heidi?
- She gave me courage.  
She made the greatest effort.
Heidi.
Give me your hand.  
This is only a down payment.
The rest comes later.  
This is yours.
- And this is for you.
- Thank you, Lord Sesemann.  
From today on call me dad.
You belong to us.  
I'll never let you go.
I'll settle this with the attorney.
It is high time.
Tinette, take the child upstairs.  
I will carry the package.
- Good night.
- Good night, Heidi.  
A doll.
That is what the Indians in
Peru wear. Do you like it?  
This is the prettiest doll I've ever received.  
This is a beautiful gift.
Is it true that I must stay here?
Of course. You are lucky.
Look at the pictures.  
The mountains. And a lake.
Does it look like this in Switzerland?
But now to bed.
Good night.  
Our cabin!
Why are you standing around here?
Sebastian didn't have time yet.
You don't need him to carry the laundry to the attic.  
Wild horses could not drag me alone up there.  
Take the basket.
I'm coming too.  
Do not be afraid. I'm only putting a latch on the door.  
Crazy women.
Ugh!
Shame on you.
Go.  
What's going on. Do you want everyone to go crazy?  
It's easy to be scared, after what happened here.  
It's the third time that the front door is wide open in the morning.  
- This place is haunted.
- Nonsense.  
There's moaning and shuffling.
Stop it!
I'm shutting up already.
But the ghost isn't.  
This can happen in the best houses.
The last place I worked was haunted too...  
You already said that yesterday.
It started in Madam's room...
What's the matter?
Come here. We must contact Lord Sesemann.  
- There are weird noises.
- Where?  
- It came from the attic.
- Nonsense.  
Like the story about the unlocked front door.  
It's probably just a student prank.
Lord Sesemann will think that we didn't lock the door. But I did!  
I'll stand guard. There are no ghosts here!  
Lord Sesemann. Please come outside.
What is it?
I have a clear head.
But this place is haunted.  
- For you maybe.
- Do not jest.  
Someone floated up the stairs.
- Who did?
- The old woman from the image.  
Sebastian had a pipe dream.
Sometimes there are inexplicable facts.  
Sure, that's nothing serious.
But there are inexplicable things that may not be doubted.  
I am a businessman.
I only believe in what I see.  
So do I. But I once saw liquid vanish into thin air.  
Are you saying that the dead can come back to life?  
Sesemann, you are a dilettante.
You can't fob me.
Come, sit down again.  
There is a great-grandmother in the family, of which it is said...  
... right. What's odd is that
Sebastian claims to have seen her.  
But Heidi. You know me.
- The nice doctor.
- Yes.  
You must have been dreaming something beautiful.  
Yes, I always dream.
What is it you dream of?
I dream of home.
Of the mountains? And the pasture?
Isn't it lonely and boring up there?
There's nothing more beautiful and more fun.  
I can't promise anything, Heidi, but I think that soon everything will be well again.  
Good night.
And sleep well.
The child is sleepwalking.
She'll become mentally ill.  
What can you do?
Is there a cure?  
There is a medicine, it's even nonprescription.  
A one-way ticket to Switzerland.
I should send the little one home?
She has everything she wants here.
And how will Klara cope alone?  
Klara will find new friends.
She can walk again now.  
Now it's Heidi who is sick.
Homesick.  
Homesick? Really?
Where is grandma's book?
Here it is.
I'm taking it with me.
There is also white bread.
Thank you. This is for Brigitte.
Hurry up. I'll fetch the suitcase.
You'll be in Basel by evening.
And tomorrow I'll be home home.
Grandfather doesn't know anything.  
Are you coming to the station?
No, it would make me cry.
And dad wants me to be very brave.
But Klara. Don't cry.
Now I am alone.
But you're coming to
Switzerland in the summer.  
I know how that will be.
I'll be stuck in Bad Ragaz and won't be allowed on the pasture.  
They'll say it's too trying for me.
But you must see the cabin and the goats.  
Heidi, do you think they'll allow me to sleep in the hay one time?  
Of course. You can stay throughout the summer.  
Don't worry, I'll talk to dad.
He wants me to get well.  
You take the trains listed and spend the night in Basel.  
But make sure to close the curtains...
...so my late great-grandmother won't appear before you.  
Dete, do you want to go with them and say hi to the grandfather?  
No, I'd rather not.
I couldn't take you back with me.
I thought you'd find happiness here.  
I always had your best interest at heart. Tell the grandfather that.  
- That's no reason to cry.
- Now I'm all alone.  
See how happy the child looks!
Adieu. Farewell, sunshine of our house.
Enough of that sobbing.
Let's go.  
Alright Heidi. We'll stick to the arrangements.  
In a few weeks, we'll go to Bad Ragaz in Switzerland.  
Klara will heal completely there and we will come to visit you.  
Then I can see the pretty flowers.
And learn how to milk goats.  
Thank you for everything,
Lord Sesemann.  
What did you promise me?
- Should I?
- Of course.  
Look at the nice hat that Heidi is wearing.  
She won't recognize us anymore.
She became a fine city woman.  
Run to Brigitte.
What are you standing around?
Be gallant and carry her suitcase.  
Did she arrive by herself?
There was a man with her.
And now the child is going back to the pasture?  
That's what she says.
We need to talk with the priest.
What a beautiful coat you have.
- And this hat.
- I don't need it.  
- Is all this yours?
- Yes.  
This is for you.
- You didn't forget!
- No.  
And this is for you.
A giant sausage!
Now I must continue.
To see grandfather.  
Go ahead. Peter will bring the suitcase to the pasture.  
It is said that you can read now. Is it true?  
- That's not hard.
- Read this.  
- I have no time now.
- Just one sentence.  
- 'The lazy Friedel'.
- That's only the title.  
Friedel was the youngest of 7 sons, who lived on the farm...  
Now I'm in deep trouble.
Now will you learn to read as well?
Guess I'll have to, darn it!
Heidi!
Grandfather.
You can go now.
Alp-hi.
What do you want?
Tomorrow is the Pentecost...
... I did not come alone.  
Is Heidi back?
Won't you say hello to people?
We didn't come here to make you feel uneasy.  
We came here because we all want to shake hands with you.  
Huh. And where are your women?
It's too steep up here.
You'll see the women when you come to church.  
We would be delighted if you would come too.  
You'll be waiting for a long time.
We are leaving now.
Perhaps you'll come yet.  
It would take a miracle.
Heidi!
Is Alp-hi coming or not?
Waiting for Alp-hi...
Praise the Lord, for the Lord is good. Amen.  
To begin today's worship, let us sing Psalm 364.  
This is Glasgow, Scotland.
The year is 1915.
This is the story of a man and his close friendship with God.
His name- Peter Marshall.
As a boy, his home was in Coatbridge nine miles away... but his heart belonged to the sea.
Oh!
How's that?
Aha!
What do we have here?
- It's that Findlay lad again.
- My name is Peter Marshall!
Marshall- Findlay-
Nuisance suits you the best!
This time I'm puttin' an end to your pranks.
- This young rooster belong to you?
- Aye. Aye, he does.
- What's he been up to?
- Three times in as many weeks, they tell me... he's been caught trying to sneak aboard the ship.
Wants to go to sea, he says.
He's gettin' off with a warnin' this time... but catch him on the docks again, and you'll be held responsible.
Dragged along like a common thief for all the street to see-
I always knew you'd disgrace us.
Then why didn't you give me your consent when I wanted to join the Royal Navy?
Ah! There's his gratitude for all the advantages we gave him- piano lessons for the young gentleman, day school for the young gentleman.
- I'm through with both.
- Are ya now?
Then you'll go to work and start paying your way.
You'll find yourselfa job, and you'll-
There now, you've made me late for mine.
The first time in 13 years!
Peter, you must go back to school.
After me making such a fool of myself... tellin' everyone good-bye... braggin' about the big things
I was going to do?
You'll still do the big things, Peter... if you'll but swallowyour pride and get your education.
You can make me so proud of you.
You can be so proud of yourself.
Do you think I could live on Mr. Findlay any longer... after what he said about payin' my way?
I'll get a job all right, but I'll start to night school.
Oh. Oh, thank you, son.
But I'm not givin' up.
Somehow, someday, I'll go to sea.
Mmm. Of courseyou will... ifit's God's plan forya.
Maybe this is one of the times that Granny used to talk about... when God slams a door in yourface... that he may guideyou to the one through which he wants you to pass.
Hmm?
Life followeda common pattern forthe young men ofCoatbridge.
As their fathers and grandfathers before them, they went to work in the mills.
For seven years,
Peter had paid his way.
When fortunate enough to work full-time, nine hours a day... he earned the equivalent ofnine dollars a week... barely enough to reimburse his stepfather,
Mr. Findlay, for room and board... and to pay for the night classes he still stubbornly attended.
Who is it?
Speak up.
What do you want?
Oh!
So it was you who called to me.
Why?
Now I know what's been holding me back.
I'd forgotten that it was you who calls the signals.
But have I got you right this time?
Do you really mean what I think you do?
# Ye'll take the high road and I'll take the low road#
# And I'll be in Scotland aforeye #
# Where me and my true love were ever wont to gae #
# On the bonny, bonny banks #
# Of Loch Lomond ##
- Son, do you want to waken Mr. Findlay?
- Oh, Mother.
- You passed in French?
- I did not. I flopped as flat as a kipper.
Oh, no.
Then what are you so happy about?
Uh, not that it isn't good to feel contented with your lot.
Contented? Oh, that's a pale word for what I'm feeling.
Tonight in the fog, the heavens opened.
They actually did, and now I know what I'm going to do.
Just when I thought my life was worth nothing, the Lord asked for it... told me he had a use for it and what was his plan for me.
And what's that, Peter?
He wants me to be a minister.
- A minister, Peter?
- Aye.
- Aren't you pleased?
- Oh.
My cup runneth over.
- But it'll take a bit of doing.
- Oh, he knows that... and already he's getting to work on it.
- He's sending me to America.
- Oh.
Three years later... by working double shifts at the mill, byscrimping andsaving...
Peter left his beloved Scotland.
With faith and trust in his heart... and $50 in his old brown wallet, he arrived in America.
Now all he had to do was wait for further instructions from the Lord... or as Peter put it,
"orders from the chief. "
- Al most. Whoa! That's it.
- But the chief took his time in communicating with Peter... as he frequently does with all ofus.
So, while he waited,
Peter worked at a variety ofjobs... finally for an excavating company... digging his way across the state of New Jersey... through the blistering heat ofmidsummer... and wondering how all this was bringing him closer to the ministry.
When all seemed futile,
God opened a door- the door ofColumbia Theological Seminary in Decatur, Georgia... where fouryears later he was graduated summa cum laude.
I t's most unusual, Peter, for a young m i nister... to begin his career with a choice of calls.
One of them is highly flattering- a large church in Atlanta.
Hmm. I am flattered and highly honored.
And what's the other call?
The little town ofCovington, Georgia.
You may take a little time, Peter.
Perhaps there's someone with whom you'd like to talk it over.
Aye, there is, sir.
There is indeed.
Hmm.
Peterput the question squarely before the Lord-
Where did he wish him to begin his work?
The answer came- the lovely little town of Covington.
After a joyous ministry in Covington...
Peter received a second call to the large church in Atlanta... a church with an indifferent congregation... and encumbered by debt.
Soon he drew such crowds it was necessary to build a balcony to accommodate them.
For those still forced to stand outside... loudspeakers were installed so that they could hear him preach.
Young people came in droves from the nearby colleges-
Emory, Oglethorpe,
Georgia Tech andAgnes Scott.
I was Catherine Wood, the girl in the tan dress... a senior at Agnes Scott College.
Oh, m iss. Oh, m iss, I'm sorry.
I t's al I right. Thank you.
For two years, I'd been listening to Peterpreach.
For two years, I'd been living just forSunday mornings.
Was Peter touched by such devotion?
He didn't know I existed.
There are men and women i n the world today... who say that God orders their lives... guides them in making decisions... provides for their needs, answers their prayers... in ways which are often strange and unexpected.
That is the testimony of my own experience... and there are many here who could make the same statement.
But if you yourselfhave not had that experience in your life... don't be too quick tojump to the conclusion... that we who saythese things are daft, mad.
I n that mood... many of us approach spiritual things.
We come, like Thomas, not doubting... but dogmatically refusing to believe unless we see... as ifwe could pour God into a test tube... as ifintangibles had to become tangible... in order to prove that they were intangible.
There are certain things that must be approached in faith- things that are matters of perception... not of proof.
Beauty is one of them.
How can you prove that anything is beautiful?
Could you demonstrate to me by logic or reason or by intellect... that the Fifth Symphony or the "Moonlight Sonata" were sheer beauty?
Can you prove by any method of intellect... why a sunset is beautiful?
Describe to me scientifically... the haunting, wistful fragrance... of a bunch of violets.
Yet you come here professing the faith... which formore than 19 centuries... has borne witness to spiritual realities... and you ask if one can prove that God exists!
You ask me to prove it.
How could my tiny mind prove God?
What kind of a god could my little mind prove?
You might as well ask the bird to prove the air in which it flies... or the minnow to prove the sea in which it swims.
Let me ask you to prove that you exist.
I'd be interested in hearing you try.
There are mysteries all around us- stirring, wonderful, inexplicable.
Take, for example, the strange phenomenon of falling in love.
Haveyou everasked the question...
"How will I know when I fall in love?"
I have.
I've asked it of blondes and brunettes... of redheads and of bald heads- of people everywhere.
And the strange thing is, I've always received the same answer, namely...
"Don't worry, brother.
You'll know. "
Love, like beauty... like the haunting, wistful fragrance of violets... is a matter ofperception and experience, not ofproof.
The great things by which we really live... are not proven by logic... but by life.
And as that is true of love and beauty... so it is true of finding God... and learning how close he stands to us.
Let us pray.
It was a fine sermon.
We thoroughly enjoyed it.
Dr. Marshall, as always, you were simply superb...
- but Mary has something to say.
- Yes.
Yes, it is an interesting and worth while idea... and we'd be delighted to cooperate.
Good-bye, Dr. Marshall.
Don't mean to eavesdrop, Miss Hopkins, but I couldn't help overhearin'.
- That was Dr. Marshall, wasn't it?
- Yes, Emma.
He'd like to borrow one of our girls for a few hours Saturday afternoon.
- What's that?
- She'll be one of four students... speaking at a youth rally at Mason Corners.
District has a serious problem- bootleggers enjoying a holiday... peddling their poison liquor to young people.
Hmm. Mere teenagers their best customers too.
- I wonder if-
- Miss Hopkins.
Don't go any further. Don't go searching through that list no further.
There's just one girl- just absolutely one who'll fill the bill.
Pretty, but not gaudy.
Smart and not show-offy.
Talks good.
Nice manners.
It was one of those rare and wonderful moments... when what seems too good to be true is true.
Peter Marshall was calling for me.
A student from Emory was bringing a girl from Oglethorpe... and a fullback from Georgia Tech was coming by himself.
Peter would discover me among the magnolias... reading
Sonnets from the Portuguese.
Then it would be Peter and I driving alone together.
Perhaps when we return from the rally... the night would be one of those blowy, mysterious nights I always love so much.
And Mason Corners was 50 miles away.
Miss Wood!
- How do you do, Miss Wood?
- Good afternoon, Dr. Marshall.
Ah. And this is Miss Standish, our pianist.
How do you do?
Hello.
On the way back, you'll be more comfortable, Miss Wood.
Our boy from Georgia Tech will driveyou home.
Hey, Willie!
Save us a seat, will ya?
Okay!
Now, the good ladies of Mason Corners have arranged this gathering... for a serious purpose- a Christian purpose.
But whoever said that Christianity can't be fun... or that fun can't be Christian?
Whoeversaid that the Lord likeda long face?
He likes us to laugh and enjoy ourselves and enjoy living, and that's what we're going to do.
So to break the ice... supposi ng we start with a song-
What'll it be?
- How about "Tattooed Rosie from New Orleans"?
Well, I- I'm afraid
I don't know "Rosie," but how would it be ifl sang you an old Scottish song?
Down in front!
Well, maybe after the serious business is through... we'll feel more like singing.
Now, the sign at the entrance advertises me as a speaker.
Well, I have a surprise foryou.
I'm not going to speak.
Good!
You're right. This is a young people's meeting... and you're going to hear the ideas of young people.
So first, that nice young girl,
Jane Whitney... from Oglethorpe University.
Come up, Jane.
Dr. Marshall, I can't.
I just can't!
Don't worry, Dr. Marshall.
I'll take care of her.
- Uh, you come up, Bruce.
- Not me, Dr. Marshall.
I plumb forgot my speech.
Well, I've certainly laid an egg.
Dr. Marshall, you're forgetting me.
Oh, no, Miss Wood. Now, it's no use.
They'll not listen.
If that's because I'm a girl, thank you, boys.
And now, if you'll let me,
I'd like to talk, as a girl... to the girls here this afternoon.
I know if you boys will listen, they'll listen too.
And I'm just as sure that the only reason... they've been just as rude and silly as you've been... is because they have the mistaken idea that you wanted them to be.
I never thought much about being a girl... until two years ago... when I learned from a man what a wonderful thing it is to be a woman.
Until that Sunday morning...
I'd considered myselflucky to be living in the 20th century... the century of progress and emancipation... the century when supposedly we women came into our own.
But I'dforgotten... that the emancipation of woman really began with Christianity... when a girl- a veryyoung girl- received the greatest honor i n history.
She was chosen to be the mother of the savior of the world.
And when her son grew up and began to teach his way of life... he ushered woman into a new place in human relations.
He accorded her a dignity she'd never known before... and crowned her with such glory that down through the ages... she was revered, protected and loved.
Men wanted to think ofher as different from themselves- better, made offiner, more delicate clay.
It remained for the 20th century... the centuryofprogress... to pull her down from herthrone.
She wanted equality.
For 1,900years, she had not been equal.
She had been superior.
T o stand equal with men, naturally she had to step down.
Now, being equal with men... she has won all their rights and privileges- the right to get drunk, the right to swear... the right to smoke, the right to work like a man... to think like a man, to act like a man.
We've won all this... but how can we feel so triumphant... when men no longer feel as romantic about us... as they did about our grandmothers... when we've lost something sweet and mysterious... something as- as hard to describe as- as the haunting, wistful fragrance of violets?
Of course, these aren't my original thoughts.
They are the thoughts
I heard that Sunday morning.
But from them, some thoughts of my own were born... and the conclusion reached... that somewhere along the line, we women got off the track.
Poets have become immortal... by remembering on paper a girl's smile.
But I've never read a poem rhapsodizing over a girl's giggles at a smuttyjoke.
OrI've neverhearda man brag... that his sweetheart or his wife could drink just as much as he and become just as intoxicated.
I've never heard a man say... that a girl's mouth was prettier with a cigarette hanging out of it... or that her hair smelled divinely of stale tobacco.
I'm afraid that's all I have to say.
I've never made a speech before.
Right on top of that, we've got to have a song.
Let's make it a good one.
# Oh, that old time religion #
# Oh, that old time religion #
- # Oh, that old time religion
It's good enough for me #
# It was good enough for Moses #
# It was good enough for Moses #
# It was good enough for Moses #
# And it's good enough for me #
# It was good enough for Daniel #
# It was good enough for Daniel #
# It was good enough for Daniel #
# And it's good enough for me #
# Oh, that old time religion #
# Oh, that old time religion #
# Oh, that old time religion
It's good enough for me #
# Oh, that old time religion #
#Oh, that old time religion #
#Oh, that old time religion #
# It's good enough for me ##
I want you to know that I was never more impressed in my life, or more flattered... that a young girl likeyou, with all her interests... should be able to remember almost word for word a sermon she'd heard over two years ago.
- Oh.
- Mind you, it was your own ideas... that really turned the tide.
It'd be very interesting to know what else is in that nice mind of yours.
That's the wonderful discovery
I've made about southern girls.
The cake is almost finer than the frosting.
Well, then we southern girls should be very grateful to your fiancée.
My fiancée?
Who might she be?
Well, there's been talk on campus that- that she's an Atlanta girl.
Definitely not, and I'd be very glad if you'd correct the rumor.
As a matter off act,
I do recall hearing it contradicted.
Someone said you were really engaged to a Scottish girl.
No, that's equally untrue. Why is everybody always tryin' to force me into matrimony?
I'll marry when I'm good and ready.
I'm good enough now, but I'm not ready.
If can wait for the Lord to pick out my wife, why can't anyone else?
- The Lord's going to do that?
- Why, certainly.
You mean, he'll pick you out for her too?
Naturally. Don't you expect him to do as much foryou?
Oh.
Perhaps he has already.
- Oh.
- Well, ifhe hasn't, he will.
# Oh, that old time religion #
Tomorrow I'm going to call the dean of Agnes Scott College... and tell her she's a woman ofreal discernment.
Strange I never noticed you in church before.
- Why?
- Well, even a minister has eyes.
I know it's awfully late, but somehow I hate to say good night.
Finding someone else that thinks likeyou do always puts me in mind of two ships... flashing their lights in a lonely sea.
They may be putting into different ports... but for a moment they knew one another was there.
- Would you mind ifl called you sometime?
- Oh, no.
We could, um, have dinner and see a movie.
Yes.
Certainly, one- one night next week.
I'll, um- I'll call you.
- Good night, Catherine.
- Good night, Dr. Marshall.
Good night, Peter.
Good night, Peter darling.
One long week ofstonysilence-
Monday, Tuesday...
Wednesday, Thursday...
Friday, Saturday.
The longest, unhappiest week ofmy life.
I have come to the conclusion that
I place Dr. Marshall on too lofty a pedestal... and that the time has come to make a clean, deep cut.
A big black period marks the end of an unhappy interlude.
I begin tomorrow by going to another church.
Marriage is not a federation of two sovereign states.
It's a union- domestic, social, spiritual and physical.
I t's the fusion of two hearts, the com i ng together of two tributaries... which, after being joined in marriage... will flow in the same channel, in the same direction... carrying the same burdens of responsibility and obligation.
Marriage is a oneness, divine and indivisible.
Peter went on with his sermon... about the holyinstitution ofmarriage... or in Peter's colorful phrasing...
"the halls ofhighest human happiness. "
But all I kept hearing over and over was...
"Marriage is a oneness, divine and indivisible. "
Aren't you with us?
Miss Wood. Green eyes, brown hair, tan dress- "ridiculous little hat. "
He doesn't miss much, does he?
I'm Ruby Coleman, Dr. Marshall's secretary.
How do you do? Ifit won't interfere with any previous plans... he'd like to haveyou wait a few minutes and driveyou back.
That's very nice of you, Miss Wood.
He needs the fresh air.
Oh, then he's been sick.
Him? Ifhe felt any better,
I think he'd explode.
He didn't bother to explain why he hadn't called.
He onlysaid that when he saw me in church, it suddenly occurred to him... that it was a beautiful day, and something should be done about it... and didn't I agree?
So we drove out to Stone Mountain.
The man at the curio store where Peter bought me a souvenir... said that almost every Sunday some foolhardy idiot... broke his leg or got stranded climbing the mountain.
Did that deter Peter?
Definitely not.
While he climbed down from the mountain...
I rehearsed a dozen charming little speeches... that would bring us back to where we left off after the youth rally.
But whenever I began one, he would warn me with what I suppose was Scottish thrift... that my ice cream was melting.
Peter took me to dinner at his favorite restaurant.
I saw the romantic glow ofcandlelight... and I thought, "At last. "
- Good eveni ng, Dr. Marshal I.
- Good evening.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Have you got a match, Henry?
The food here's the best in Atlanta, but there's only one drawback.
The gloom's so dense, your fork gets lost between your plate and your mouth.
Nor can you enjoy looking at a pretty girl, if she happens to be sitting oppositeyou.
I was wondering what you thought about my sermon this morning.
It's very important to me that I should know howyou feel, so please be perfectly frank.
"Marriage is the fusion of two hearts...
"the coming together of two tributaries...
"which, after being joined together in marriage...
"will flow in the same direction...
"carrying the same burdens of responsibility and obligation.
Marriage is a oneness, divine and indivisible. "
- Then you did like it.
- Oh, Peter.
Well, that settles it then.
It'll be my talk before the young people's groups... in Baltimore,
Philadelphia, Washington.
- What did you say?
- Oh, didn't I tell you?
I'm leaving tomorrow on a two-week speaking tour... but I'll call you the minute I get back.
When you get back,
I won't be here.
Why not?
It'll be all over.
I'll be graduated.
Oh, how could I have forgotten that?
And you'll be leaving Atlanta?
To spend the summer with my parents in West Virginia.
In the fall,
I begin teaching.
Well, I'm sure you'll be a fine teacher.
As I've told you more than once, you've-you've got a very nice mind.
And know that I'll bewishing you all good luck and happiness.
Thank you.
And I wish you happiness too- all the happiness in theworld.
What's the matter, child?
What's that man do to you?
I's glad I's a Baptist!
I's glad I ain't young!
Glad I just got a seat in the bleachers.
- You lost your hearing oryour mind?
- Oh, Emma, go away.
And let that man come charging up here like a roaring lion?
"That man"?
What man?
Stop asking foolish questions and do something radical to that face.
Oh, Emma. Oh!
You'd better go easy with that, honey.
I got a notion that-
What am I saying?
Oh, I'm a stupid, glaikit lump.
I didn't realize what a shock this must be.
But God just spun me around like a top and said...
"Peter, you idiot, don't you see this is my grandest plan foryou?"
Glory, hallelujah!
What's the matter, darling?
Oh, Peter, I'm frightened.
Are you sure this is God's will and not just Catherine Wood's?
- I don't know what you mean.
- Of courseyou don't.
How could you know that for two years, from the- from the very first moment I saw you...
I- I've schemed and- and plotted... and dreamed that somehow this would happen- that, impossible as it seemed... you'd love me too.
Oh, Catherine, this gets more and more wonderful.
I'm not sure that it is.
Maybe you never had a chance.
You hear about the power of thought, about- about willing things to happen...
- that- that the mind is like a magnet and-
- Oh, rubbish!
Don't you know that God plants his own lovely dream in the human heart... and that when the dream is mature... and the time for it is ripe for its fulfillment... well, to our astonishment and delight... his will becomes ours, and ours his?
Now, who but God could've thought of anything as perfect as this?
Well, I- I'll have to consult my calendar... and, uh- and, uh, rearrange my plans.
But with christenings and weddings and speaking dates I'm already committed to...
I don't see how we can get married till practically the end of the summer.
Does that disturbyou, Catherine?
Oh.
What could ever disturb me again?
It was well into fall... before Peter caught up with his busyschedule.
We were married in the old family church in West Virginia... and blissfully set sail for a Cape Cod honeymoon.
Oh, Catheri ne, could anythi ng be fi ner?
She's a snug little ship.
How long is it going to take us to get to Cape Cod?
We'll be there in the morning.
I got a whiff from the galley.
I think it's-
Aye, it's roast turkey.
- Honey, what's the matter?
- I don't know, but I think I'm seasick.
Seasick? You're not.
You couldn't be.
- I always get seasick.
- But there's no such malady. It's all in your mind.
I couldn't have married a girl who'd get seasick.
But you did. And what are you going to do about it?
Oh, the poor girl.
She really believes it.
It was the most beautiful ofhoneymoons.
Peterfell more than ever in love with the sea... and I fell in love with it too- from the proper distance, ofcourse.
Catheri ne, look! Another one!
- Now will you come out?
- No!
But it's as smooth as glass!
All right then, be stubborn.
But no self-respecting fish will come near you.
- Catherine, your line!
- Ooh!
Now why don't you say something?
Well done, Catherine!
I must've scared it your way.
Oh, good morning, Mr. Briscoe.
Lookwhat I caught.
- Yeah. This came for Dr. Marshall.
- Oh.
They thought at the inn it might be somethin'.
- Thank you.
- Oh, that's all right.
Peter! Telegram!
Open it!
- It doesn't make any sense. I can't understand it.
- Whynot?
Well, it's- it's from Washington-
Washington, D.C.
It says,
"Manse redecorated...
"and awaiting you and Mrs. Marshall.
"Moving van arriving tomorrow.
Kindest regards, Evanston Whiting. "
Do you know an Evanston Whiting?
That's Colonel Whiting... president of the board of trustees... of the New YorkAvenue Church,
Washington, D.C.
- But what does it mean?
- Now, don't get excited.
I wanted nothing to disturb our honeymoon, so I didn't tell you.
Tell me what, Peter?
That we're not going back to Atlanta.
We're going to Washington.
All summer long, I've been pondering a call to the old New YorkAvenue Church- the church of the presidents-
Abraham Lincoln worshipped there.
- Aren't you pleased?
- Oh, well, who wouldn't be?
Let's go.
Oh, wonderful. Here- Put it-
Put it right there. That's fine.
Thank you.
You see, Catherine?
That'll giveyou an idea ofhow cozy it will be.
That's our first call.
- Why don't you answer it?
- Well, I can't find the blasted thing.
Catherine, do something!
Well- Oh, here.
Follow this cord.
Hello?
Oh, hello,
Colonel Whiting.
Yes, we're getting along beautifully. Thank you.
Yes. Yes, I've got it.
All right then.
We'll see you at 8:00 this evening.
Fine. Good-bye.
Peter, you're not letting anyone come to this house?
Of course not. We're going to their home for dinner.
Peter, we can't! My hair- It's a mess, and nothing's unpacked.
There's nothing to worry about.
It's just a friendly evening...
- at Colonel Whiting's little farm in the country.
- Oh.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
May I?
- Who may I announce, please?
- Uh, Dr. and Mrs. Marshall.
Oh. This way, please.
Quaint little farmhouse.
Dr. and Mrs. Marshall.
Dr. and Mrs. Marshall... welcome to Washington.
This is all my fault.
I told Mrs. Marshall a small, informal dinner.
That's exactly what it is, my dear- just our own special little group.
- Please come in. Come in.
- This is our granddaughter Barbara.
- How do you do?
- How do you do, Barbara?
Our new pastor and the lady of the manse.
Uh, an interesting coincidence.
Our first pastor back in those days was also a Scotsman.
He was only 22 when he came to America and took over the pulpit.
That makes me feel much less a stranger.
The church had not yet been built.
Services were being held in the old treasury building... burned by the British in 1812.
Pennsylvania Avenue was a cow path... along which Thomas Jefferson had planted some poplar trees.
Why, nobody knows.
Coal had just come into use, but it was too expensive for us... so Dr. Laurie would come early every Sabbath morning... and start a roaring fire in the old woodstove.
A real, true Scotsman!
And my great-grandfather supplied the wood.
Also boarded Dr. Laurie without charge.
What a perfectly beautiful heritage.
You know, Dr. Marshall, you don't look like a minister.
- Barbara, really!
- Well, Gran, he doesn't.
Well, that's probably because Dr. Marshall isn't wearing his clerical collar.
Look, I'm afraid my obvious deficiencies can't be corrected that easily.
I don't own a clerical collar.
But for the pulpit of the New YorkAvenue
Church, you're surely going to acquire one.
Positively not, Miss Fowler. I couldn't breathe, let alone preach, in one of those things.
Oh, Laura, wait till you hear
Dr. Marshall preach.
You won't care ifhe doesn't wear any... collar.
Would anyone like more coffee?
You did beautifully tonight.
I was very proud of you.
Now, let's drive by the church.
- At this hour?
- Mm-hmm. It's on our way.
Ah, there it is- the church of the presidents.
Abraham Lincoln's church.
- We're going in, darling.
- But, Peter, it's past midnight.
There's something I have to see.
I can't wait.
I know a southern girl shouldn't be impressed, but-
Well, what do you think I feel?
From the Coatbridge tube works to Ellis Island to here in only 10 years.
Now, will you please takeyour place in the pastor's pew?
That's what I had to see- howyou lookwhile I'm preaching.
Always be there, darling.
God had some wonderful plan when he sent us here.
Don't you feel it, Catherine?
Let's pray that we never let him down... that we serve him in this beloved old church... in this great city of Washington... according to his will.

I t has been said... that a new minister's first sermon... while he is still strange to his congregation... and his congregation strange to him... frequently has far-reaching repercussions.
You haveyour ideas of what your pastor should be... and your pastor has his ideas of what your church should be.
I have come, practicallyas a stranger... to this imposing old church... a church whose history is almost as old as this country... a church whose traditions and legends
I respect and find thrilling and exciting.
Now, historyand tradition and legends are fine.
We couldn't live without the past... but past glory has never been enough for a nation... or a church or even an individual.
There's always the all-important now and the more important future.
I look out this morning... on a church not even half-filled.
Now, this in no way injures my personal pride, myvanity.
I'm not here to recruit fans for a fellow named Peter Marshall.
Nor am I here to sell anything.
That which we callsalvation- anda most comprehensive term it is- is a free gift.
You can't buyit.
Neither can you earn it.
It's not a reward dangling before the Christian like a carrot before a mule.
I t's not somethi ng that the church has to peddle.
And probably no idea hurts me more... than suggesting that I am a salesman... endeavoring to sell people on the idea of religion.
I resent it bitterly.
Religion is not forsale.
It's given away.
So today... as I start my ministry in this hallowed old church...
I think it only fair to explain... that it isn't the church or religion... that I'm trying to present, but Christ.
Not the pale, anemic, namby-pamby Jesus- the gentle Jesus, meek and mild- but the Christ of the Gospels... striding up and down the dusty miles of Palestine... suntanned, bronzed, fearless... the knuckles big in his carpenter's hands- the Christ who upset the moneylenders- the Christ who had a good time at weddings... and who would not allow his host to be embarrassed by running short of wine- the Christ who loved people- all kinds of people... but particularly red-blooded folk... for he himselfwas red-blooded- the Christ who calleda spade a spade... and who let the chips fall where theymight.
Not the Jesus of the perfumed cloisters ofpious sentiment... but the man who walked the streets of the city, stopping here and there... to pass the time ofday in places where you and I could not afford to be seen... and getti ng a huge kick out of it!
Let us be honest.
Let us recognize that the kind of people that Christ liked best... were not the kind that the average church appeals to at all.
Think of the people whom he personally invited to be his friends.
Peter and Andrew, James and John- fish merchants!
Zacchaeus and Matthew- unpopular tax collectors.
Saul of Tarsus- an aristocrat, a persecutor of the church.
Mary Magdalena- once a prostitute.
Joanna, wife of Herod's chancellor- a so-called society woman.
There are- I'm sure- in Washington... countless people who fall intojust this category.
We cannot afford to be indifferent to them.
We must invite the sophisticates, the irreligious... the lost and the lonely.
We must extend to them our fellowship and introduce them to Christ.
That is our busi ness, nothi ng else.
For Christ likes people, all kinds of strange people... people whom we might have to think twice about before cultivating.
He wants them.
He enjoys their life and vigor.
He wants to hear laughter, a joke... ifit's a good one.
A man ofsorrows and acquainted with grief, that he was.
But it was in order that our joy might be full.
That is the Christ that I know.
That is the Christ that I would have dwell in this historic old church... his big carpenter's hands stretched out in welcome.
Let us pray.
- A most auspicious beginning, Dr. Marshall. Most auspicious.
- Thank you very much.
- You surely gave us something to think about.
- Thank you very much.
- How are you, Barbara?
- Back in the fold. You just brought in your first sheep.
Barbara, whatever in the world do you mean by that?
This child's gone to church all her life.
Just like I go to the dentist- every six months.
You know, the other night,
I knewyou were different.
Now I knowyou're just the greatest, and I'm spreading the word.
Thank you, Barbara.
Good morning, Miss Fowler.
- How are you, Mrs. Peyton?
- Dr. Marshall, you've simply got to do something.
Laura- Miss Fowler's frightfully upset.
Aye. So I gathered.
Could you tell me why?
It all started the other night really- you know, about the collar?
And then this morning just added fuel to the flames.
- How do you mean?
- Well, it was mostly little things... like making the Lord seem almost common... and calling a spade a spade and letting the chips fall.
- Is that all?
- Oh, dear. Maybe I shouldn't have spoken to you.
Please don't be upset or hurt, but she thinks that you, an immigrant... have no right to invite just anybody into New YorkAvenue.
I can't stay. She might imagine that you and I have been talking about her.
I'm one who came uninvited, Dr. Marshall, and I liked your sermon... particularlytheway the chips fell where they might.
That's very kind of you, sir.
To a stranger from the Middle West... this old church and all that goes with it is very exciting.
- Are you a visitor in Washington?
- More or less.
Just make your self at home.
Go downstairs... and see the Lincoln Parlor and all the old documents.
Thank you.
I'll admit you shook us up a bit, but we've decided we can stand it.
As you your self foresaw, there'll be repercussions.
But as a businessman, I know that when you hire new blood, you get new ideas.
- Sometimes they're good.
- Well, gentlemen, I must admit I'm very much relieved.
- Did you knowyou drew a United States senator?
- I did?
I've never even seen a United States senator.
Senator Willis K. Harvey.
Odd chap.
Met him at a luncheon the other day.
Well, I hope he comes back again.
The Lord could do with a few senators- and vice versa.
But, boy, it's simply incredible.
Weather like this, and every inch of the church packed- the lecture rooms, the chapel- and still those hundreds standing outside.
How do you feel when you see something like this?
Scared, sir.
Scared to death.
It's when I do my hardest praying.
Haven't these people any churches of their own?
So much influenza going around too.
Oh, my!
# A mighty fortress #
# Is our God #
# A bulwark#
# Neverfailing#
# On Earth is not#
# His equal#
# Amen##
Sure is a stormy one.
Well, after four stormyyears at
New York Avenue, I'd say it's very appropriate.
Maybe that's why Mrs. Marshall selected it as an anniversary present.
Of course, to tell you the truth,
I gently guided her... towards the gallery where it was to be found.
She gave it to me with the stipulation that she didn't have to look at it.
Well, that's our gain.
- How is Mrs. Marshall?
- At 9:00 this morning she was feeling fine.
At 6:00 this evening she was feeling even finer.
I'd better get the latest bulletin.
How are you feeling, darling?
Oh, that's fine.
Nice considerate son you're having.
Well, of course, it's going to be a boy.
Yes, sir.
- Hey, Senator Harvey.
- Good evening.
- I thought it was you. We haven't seen you for a long time.
- I've been around.
Watch it.
Um, can I give you a lift any where?
No. That is, nowhere in particular.
What do you mean by that,
"nowhere in particular"?
I was wondering if you'd like to go someplace and have a sandwich.
Why, I'd love to.
What's wrong, Senator?
I'm not a senator, Peter.
You mean, all this time you've been an impostor?
No. I've been just what
I was sent here to be... a name on the Senate roster.
Didn't you know that I was only serving out the term of the late Senator Pine?
Oh, I probably did, but I never thought much about it.
He was killed in an accident his first year in Washington.
The big boys back home were caught short.
They wanted another Joe Pine.
So, they played it safe.
They looked around for someone with... n- not so much a clean slate as a- a blank one.
I was appointed.
Nothing was expected of me but to hold down a seat... vote the way they wanted me to.
Like "yes" on the Cheavers' Land Bill tomorrow.
Do you like that bill?
The boys back home do.
Several million acres of timber will be cut.
The state will have a fresh crop of millionaires.
And then next spring... thousands ofsmall farms will be flooded and washed out.
I see.
You know, you-you have a strange... maybe even dangerous effect on a stodgy little guy like me.
- Dangerous?
- Yeah.
You make me think
I'd like,just once... to stand on a hill and- and feel the wind in my face.
You know, you don't have to look far to find your hill.
I might also find that there was no demand... back at our state university... for the services of a reasonably fair history professor... once my time is up.
Thank you.
Thank you, Peter.
In again, out again.
Gone again, Finnegan.
Boy, we sure earn our money taking care of you.
How'd the luncheon go?
What'd you tell those bankers?
That "In God We Trust" is on a thin dime as well as on a silver dollar.
Yes, sir.
A call from the superintendent of the Naval Academy at Annapolis.
You're invited to speak in the chapel a week from Sunday.
The Naval Academy? Ah, tell the superintendent
I'd be greatly honored.
Another acceptance.
General and Mrs. Eisenhower... will attend the St. Andrew's Day dinner.
Well, any more good news today?
Senator Harvey called. I-I'm not sure that I have his message straight.
He said something about a hill and the wind orthe breeze... or something being very refreshing.
Uh, does that mean anything to you?
A lessening of tension as Tokyo announces that Special Envoy Saburo Kurusu... is en route to Washington to meet with
Cordell Hull and Ambassador Nomura.
However, the big news today on Capitol Hill... is the defeat of the controversial
Cheavers' Land Bill.
The deciding vote came by way of a bombshell.
It was cast by
Senator Willis K. Harvey.
On the other side ofCapitol Hill-
- So, that was what he meant.
- That was it, Miss Crilley.
- But what a strange way of putting it.
- Aye.
Strange and mysterious, like the ways of the Lord.
I don't feel right about this sermon.
There's something wrong with it, and I can't put my finger on it.
I'll read a page or so, then maybe you could tell me.
"Everyone agrees that we of the 20th century...
"have made far more advances in the scientific world... than we have in the world of morals and ethics. "
- Peter, I hate to interrupt-
- Why, is it that bad?
No. I'm sure it's wonderful.
But I think you'd better get me to the hospital right away.
Catherine!
Peter, I thought you'd be halfway to Annapolis by this time.
I had to have one more look at him.
And, believe it or not, he's grown a good inch since 6:53 this morning.
Good-bye, darling.
I'll call you as soon as I get back.
And thank you, Catherine.
Thank you for the bonnywee laddie.
Thank you for my son.
# Eternal Father #
# Strong to save #
#Whose arm doth bind #
# The restless wave#
#Who bidd'st the mighty ocean deep #
They're so young.
So young and fine.
Something wrong,
Dr. Marshall?
I can't throw off the feeling that the sermon
I've prepared isn't the right one.
It's been haunting me all week.
Well, then, by all means, say what you like.
I think I shall.
Thank you.
James, fourth chapter...
14th verse.
For what is your life?
It is even a vapor... that appeareth for a little while... then vanisheth away.
What a queer thing for James to say.
It's a strange statement to find in the New Testament, is it not?
Is he being cynical?
Is he joking?
Well, hardly.
If you look at the context in which this statement appears... you will see that James is speaking to those... who make great assumptions as to the future... with never a thought of the contingency of life itself.
He's addressing himself to those who never think ofGod... and who act and live as though they had a mortgage on time... thosewho give no thought to the fact that they may never see tomorrow... those who act as though they had a long lease on life... as though they had immunity somehow... as though that cold and clammy hand of the dread messenger... would never touch their hearts.
Yet, death inevitablycomes... to the king in his palace... the beggarbythe roadside... the animal in his hole.
But what is death?
I s it to be blown out like a candle in the wind?
Is it a shivering void in which there is nothing that lives?
Is it a cold space into which we are launched... to be evaporated orto disappear?
Arewe to believe that a half-mad eternal humorist... tossed the worlds aloft and left their destiny to chance?
That a man's life is the development of a nameless vagrancy?
That a hole in the groundsix feet deep is his final heritage?
There are a thousand insane things easier to believe than these.
How can we believe that human personality wi I I not survive... when one who went into the grave and beyond... came back to say...
"Whosoever believeth in me shall not perish... but have eternal life. "
In a home of which I know... a little boy, the only son... was ill of an incurable disease.
Month after month, the mother had tenderly read to him... nursed him and played with him... hoping to keep him from realizing... the dreadful finality of the doctor's diagnosis.
But as the weeks went by and he grew no better... the little fellow gradually began to understand the meaning of the term "death," and he too knew that soon he was to die.
One day, the mother had been reading to him the stirring tales... of King Arthur and his knights of the Round Table...
And of that last glorious battle in which so many fair knights met their death.
As she closed the book... the boy lay silent for a moment... then asked the question that had been weighing on his childish heart.
"Mother, what is it like to die?
Mother, does it hurt?"
Quick tears sprang to her eye, and she fled into the kitchen... supposedly to tend to something on the stove.
She knew it was a question with deep significance. She knew it must be answered.
She leaned for an instant against the kitchen door and breathed a hurried prayer... that the Lord would not let her break down in front of the boy... that he would tell her what to say.
And the Lord did tell her.
Immediately she knew how to explain it to him.
"Kenneth," she said, as she returned to his room...
"you remember how when you were a little boy...
"you would play so hard all day...
"that when night came you were too tired even to undress...
"and would tumble into your mother's bed and fall asleep?
"In the morning, much to your surprise...
"you would wake up and find yourself in your own room in your own bed.
"You were there because someone had loved you and taken care of you.
"Your daddy had come with big strong arms and carried you to your own room.
"Kenneth, death is like that.
"We just wake up one morning...
"to find ourselves in the other room-
"our own room where we belong... because the Lord Jesus had loved us. "
The lad's shining, trusting face looking up into hers... told her that there would be no more fear... only love and trust in his little heart... as he went to meet the Father in heaven.
He never questioned again.
And several weeks later, he fell asleep... just as she had said.
That is what death is like.
Yet, in the life beyond... the question inevitably comes...
"With what body do we move?"
Certainly not with such a body as ours is today.
Not with rickets or a clubfoot.
Not with twisted spine or withered arm.
Not with calloused hands or wrinkled brow.
Not with a heart filled with the broken glass ofvanquished dreams.
Not with the drunkard's thirst like the fires ofhell... nor the sensualist's lust like gnawing worms.
Not with the bitter memories of a son's crime or a daughter's shame.
Not with the scar across the throat that the maniac's frenzy made. No!
Not with these do we make our entrance upon that largerstage.
We rise, not clothed again in dying clay... not garbed once more with the faded garments of mortal flesh... but with the shining mercy ofGod.
If the Bible is true... and Christ has not deceived us... there awaits beyond the curtain... a life that will never end... a life of beauty andpeace andlove.
A life ofreunion with loved ones... who, like ourselves... have trusted in the verypresence ofGod.
There shal I be no more pain... no more sorrow... nor tears, nor parting, nor death anymore.
Age shall not weary nor the years condemn.
We shall enter into that for which we were created.
It shall be the journey's end for the heart... and all its hopes.
It shall be the end of the rainbow for the child-explorers ofGod.
We have his promise for that.
Let us pray.
Our fathers' God... to thee who are the author of our liberty... and under whom we have our freedom... we say our prayer.
Make us ever mindful that we are the heirs of a great heritage... and the trustees of priceless things... lest we forget the price that was paid for them... or the cost that mayyet have to be met to keep them.
Make us strong, O God, in conviction... with the insight of our perilous times... and in the courage for our testing.
Amen.
Dr. Marshall.
I only know
I had to give that sermon.
- Can I give you a lift?
- Thank you, sir.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are interrupting this program... to bringyou an important announcement.
The Japanese have attacked
Pearl Harbor, Honolulu from the air... and all naval and military objectives of the island ofOahu... the principle American base in the Hawaiian Islands.
Attention all military and naval personnel... all leaves are canceled.
Return at once to your bases.
I repeat, return at once to your bases.
Please stand by for further announcement.
Wil I you let me out, si r?
I 'I I catch a ride back.
Now came the waryears. Peter made tours ofcamps... spoke at bond rallies, visited army and navy hospitals.
With the influx ofmilitary personnel and government workers... his ministerial duties doubled and tripled.
And from Normandy to Okinawa... lonely boys remembered the canteen in the basement of an old Washington church.
# Yes, mares eat oats and does eat oats #

# Oh, mares eat oats, anddoes eat oats andlittle lambs eat ivy##
Sorry. Girls, it doesn't seem possible, but they went through that last batch of sandwiches.
Reinforcements coming up.
For a senator, you do make the best coffee.
I think it's the egg.
Oh, by the way... did I congratulate you on your recent victory?
- Recent victory?
- Being returned to the Senate, of course.
- Oh, that was nearly two years ago.
- Oh, my, how time flies.
Well, better late than never.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
What's the matter,
Catherine?
Oh, nothing.
I guess I'm just a little tired.
I'll take it.
You watch my coffee, hmm?
Thank you, Senator.
Catherine.

Laura, I'm so happyyou've decided to join us.
And you've brought flowers too.
I have no intention of joining you.
And the flowers are for Mr. Lincoln.
It's my custom, if you remember, to decorate his parlor on the eve ofhis birthday.
- Yes, and it's such a sweet custom too.
- Hey, ma'am...
- we're fresh out of sandwiches.
- Refreshments coming right up now.
- I'll take 'em.
- Oh, well, thank you.
- He's so-
- Rude.
Yes. No! Yes.
Good night, Laura.

What's the matter, Willie?
Don't you like my knuckleball?
Just get over the plate. That's all.
Maybe I'm too fast for you.
Now see what you can do with this one.
There it comes!
- Boy, that's a beaut.
- Wow.
Don't worry, Willie.
Don't worry.
Oh, good morning.
A great little ballplayer, that Willie Updike.
You mark my words. We're going to hear from that boy someday.
I'm awfully sorry about the window.
Naturally I'll pay for replacing it.
There's nothing very special about it, is there?
Oh, you wouldn't think so,
Dr. Marshall.
It was only the Abigail Fowler window- a memorial to my grandmother.
Oh, I am sorry, Miss Fowler.
- But I'm thankful it's only a small pane.
- Yes.
I suppose we should be thankful that the church is standing at all.
- Just what do you mean by that?
- I don't think I need to explain.
Now, Laura, we agreed there was to be no bickering... no rehashing of personal grievances.
Now,just what do you mean?
Is this a censuring committee or something?
Well, not exactly.
But an incident... possibly a situation, has arisen that requires immediate discussion.
Uh, supposewe adjourn to your study, Dr. Marshall?
By all means.
Miss Fowler.
Mrs. Peyton, would you sit here?
Colonel Whiting.
Mr. Peyton.
No, thanks,
I'll stand here.
- Yes?
- No calls, please, unless it's Mrs. Marshall calling.
Now, what is this situation that's arisen?
Well, it's the canteen,
Dr. Marshall.
Laura- Miss Fowler- wants to close it up.
Close the canteen?
Why, I've never heard of anything so fantastic.
I understand howyou feel,
Dr. Marshall.
I admit I was wholeheartedly for it in the beginning... but these things can get out ofhand.
Well, is it the- is it the noise you're referring to?
N- No. No one's complained about that.
Well, then what in heaven's name is there to complain about?
Haveyou evervisited the canteen,
Miss Fowler?
Indeed not.
I've disapproved ofit from the start.
But, as with many of your innovations,
I've kept silence.
I can't say I've not been aware of your silences, Miss Fowler.
They've been very eloquent.
How could they be other wise,
Dr. Marshall?
New YorkAvenue Church was my life, my heritage.
It's as if myvery home had been invaded by strangers... invited by a stranger.
And an immigrant to boot.
Sinceyou mention it, yes.
And one deliberately and defiantly alien... to all that this church has stood for.
Oh, I've watched you strolling the streets of Washington in that shirt and coat... belonging at a race meet.
I've watchedyou buildyour ego by changing and uprooting.
I've watched the old things go.
The quartet, an elegant tradition in the New York Avenue Church... replaced by the booming choir of yours.
But, Laura, everybody thinks the choir's better.
- Please let her go on, Mrs. Peyton.
- I'm almost finished.
I could bring up a hundred affronts that I've endured without protest.
But the other night when I visited the church... and found the lecture room where
Mrs. Hathaway conducted her Bible class... turned into a cabaret... the Lincoln Parlor desecrated-
The Lincoln Parlor?
Oh, it wasn't anything so terrible.
I mean, it wasn't anything you couldn't see in any park these days.
But maybe it was a little out of place on Mr. Lincoln's sofa.
So that's what all this is about?
Ayoung sailor and a girl?
- Then you did know about it.
- Certainlyl knew.
I turned it over to them.
I even told them to lock the door.
It's too bad they didn't.
We're all adults, Dr. Marshall, and reasonably broad-minded...
- but I think in this instance- - Where else could those two kids go to be alone?
Where in Washington could they even find a doorstep in these days?
As an immigrant and an alien...
I can't claim to know Mr. Lincoln as well as you people... but I don't believe that he minded a bit... that those two spent their poor little two-hour honeymoon in his parlor.
Honeymoon?
That's right.
That's all they had.
I married them round 7:00 that night.
He was shipping out at 9:00.
She was a little girl from an Iowa farm... a government worker, one of these strangers...
I permitted to invade
New YorkAvenue Church.
He was a boy from California.
They met in this canteen.
Hello?
Oh, hello, Catherine.
All right, darling.
In about 10 minutes.
All right. Good-bye.
My wife has a medical appointment.
Our son will be alone, so I must go home.
As for the canteen, it stays open, oryou can find yourselves a new minister.
Now are you being fantastic,
Dr. Marshall?
True, there was a slight misunderstanding, but it's been cleared up.
- Sure, a case of mistaken identity.
- Oh, Dr. Marshall... if onlyyou had let me know about that sweet little couple...
I could have baked them a cake.
- Where's the kitchen?
- Uh- Oh, right here.
- Oh.
- A fine, big, cozy kitchen... with a great pot ofScotch broth steaming away... and shortbread in the oven.
- Which reminds me, are you hungry?
- Yes.
So am I.
Mommy!
Hi. Hello, Peter John.
Will you excuse us for a minute, Peter John?
Why don't you play down here for a while?
- Can I melt some ice cubes in the kitchen?
- All right.
What's the matter,
Catherine?
I have tuberculosis.
There's no need to be afraid of me.
I asked the doctor.
I asked all three doctors.
It isn't dangerous.
I can't give it to you or to Peter John.
It's- It's what's known as a closed case.
Dr. Blackwants you to call him.
He'll tell you all about it.
But this doesn't mean that- that you've got to go away?
Oh, no. Just to bed for three or four months.
- That's not too bad.
- How can you say that?
Who'll look after the house?
Who'll take care of Peter John?
I don't know, but there'll be somebody.
Not every maid in Washington's on the swing shift.
Now, darling, you go and change.
I'll turn your bed down.
What about dinner?
I think Peter John's throwing something together now.
Hello, darling.
How's everything?
Oh, all sparkling excitement.
I can hear the cars passing in the streets.
Once in a while a bird comes and sits on the sill.
Oh. Poor Catherine.
Why do you say that? Why don't you tell me that everything's going to be all right?
Or are you simply reconciled to all this?
Oh, darling.
I'm sorry.
"Miss Myrtle Bixby. "
Who's she?
A little girl who used to live next doorto me when I was seven.
She had beautiful red hair, and I was jealous ofit.
So I told the other kids it was dyed.
"Mr. R.J. Ross of Keyser High School"?
My algebra teacher.
I cheated in a final examination.
Other wise, I wouldn't have passed.
And "Mrs. Lionel Eaton"?
A girl from Agnes Scott.
We had a fight... overyou as a matter off act.
I'm writing to everyone in my past life that I ever did a mean thing to or- or thought a mean thought about or- or cheated or deceived.
- But why?
- Because I've tried everything else.
There must be something
I've done to someone.
There has to be some reason for this.
Now, you know better than that.
God doesn't send misfortune by way of retaliation.
But I have to do something. I-
You don't realize what it's-what it's like lying here month after month.
Yes, I do.
No, you don't.
You couldn't.
You're-You're healthy and strong and- and alive.
Daddy!
I promised to take him to the zoo.
Come on.
You drink up your milk.
If it'll makeyou feel any better,
I'll mail these.
Please.
Peter?
Peter, you still pray for me, don't you?
You haven't given up?
Oh, Catherine.
Do you wonder we're baffled?
One could say that for almost three years... your wife has been standing at a crossroads... without taking a step in either direction.
She's had every new test, every treatment known to science.
We've even used her as a guinea pig.
I wish I could offer as much as a word of encouragement... but I wouldn't even dare to do that.
Well, thank you, Doctor.
I appreciate your seeing me after hours.
Anytime, Dr. Marshall.
Something wrong with the furnace.
Oh, God, what's happened to us?
You and me.
Whatever it is, it- it's got to be my fault.
As I told Catherine when she said there must be some reason... you don't punish.
Could it be that I've-
I've presumed on your friendship... and you're just putting me in my place?
Did I get a little fatheaded... perhaps reading into your plans more than you meant... or interpreting them conveniently in my own direction?
Perhaps Miss Fowler was right.
I was just building my own ego under the pretense ofbuilding foryou.
Oh, I know there are ministers... doing a much betterjob foryou than I am... and not making nearly as much noise about it.
Maybe I like this town too much.
Maybe I'm just standing off... watching myselfwalk down
Pennsylvania Avenue... saying,
"Hello, Mr. Ambassador. "
"How are you, Mr. Senator?"
"Good morning, Mr. Vice President. "
Thinking that Peter Marshall sure has come a long way.
Well, I haven't, Lord.
I'm way back there.
I haven't as much and I'm not as much as I was when I was- when I was working with one of these.
Oh, Lord, why can't
I get through to you anymore?
You know there's nothing I want so much in my life as to help Catherine, but...
I can't do it by myself.
I can't do anything without you.
Surely Jesus had the power to lift from the dust of disease... the flowers whose stems had been crushed or withered in the mildews ofhuman misery.
There came to this woman from Galilee... the assurance that ifshe could but touch him, even if onlythe hem ofhis garment... shewould be cured ofher awful malady.
As this thought burned itselfinto her mind... herfaith was curiously stirred as it wrestled in the birth throes of a great resolve.
It was daring, fantastic perhaps, but it was worth trying.
It could only fail... and shewas no strangerto failure.
Thus reasoning, she pushes her waythrough the dense throng.
People get in theway.
Now she is desperate.
He must not pass so near and yet so far away.
Is she to lose this opportunity?
She must touch him.
Now she can almost reach him.
At last,just as he passes, she is able to reach out her hand... and with the tip ofherfinger she touches his robe.
It was enough.
God, I've tried.
But I can't touch you.
My faith's worn out.
I can't beg or beseech or demand anymore.
I haven't the strength of that woman in Galilee.
I can't fight my way through what ever wall there is between us.
I've done everything
I've known how to do.
If you want me to spend the rest of my life as an invalid... here I am.
Do whatever you want with me.
Catherine!
Catherine.
I knew it. I knew it.
Halfway through the sermon it was as though a voice said...
"Catherine's all right.
Catherine's all right. "
Yes, but- but, Peter, it worked backwards.
- I told him he didn't have to do anything.
- That's all he was waiting for.
He just wanted the gift of every bit of you.
Oh, my darling.
Ofcourse, the miracle wasn't complete.
But the next daythe doctors admitted the change and marveled at it.
They advised continued rest, but a change ofscenery.
So Peter made the down payment on a little house on the Cape... and there we spent the summer.
All my life I will recall it as the happy summer.
Peter painted the shutters blue... and planted the little red roses that reminded him ofScotland.
And he and Peter John built a boat.
I expected the boat to sink first time out, but it proved seaworthy.
And two old salts sailed the bounding Maine.
A bonny boat, eh?
Aye.
- And a bonny surprise for Mother.
- Aye.
But we'll have to handle this with exquisite tact.
- It's her house, and it has to be her decision.
- Well, gosh, Dad... she's just got to sayyes.
Good night.
Gee whiz.
Now, you watch it.
With your Agnes Scott mother... you're liable to "gee whiz" yourself right out of this deal.
What are you two trying to put over?
- His name's Jeff.
- And smart.
Boy. Gosh, I'm so glad you're crazy about him.
- Aye, a bonny boat.
- Aye.
When we return next summer, you'll be big enough to handle heryourself.
- Aye.
- Hey, you're locking up my book.
All the books are packed and in the car.
A little paperback called
The Case of the Perfumed Mouse?
- I think so.
- Well, I hope so.
I can't spend the winter wondering whether it was the blonde who murdered the redhead...
- or whether it was the fellow in the closet.
- Well, of course not.
Hey, where's Jeff?
We can't go without Jeff.
- Jeff's packed and in the car too.
- Oh, boy.
Aren't you wonderful?
You wear well, darling.
Yep, our quiet days are over.
As of right now.
- Hi, Mrs. Marshall.
- Hello, Lyle. Eddie.
Oh, I'm afraid you'll have to slide out on this side, Dr. Marshall.
Peter John. Hiya, Doc.
You sure look good.
What's the matter, Doctor?
Oh, it's nothing- nothing, I'm sure.
How are you boys? I've got to rush.
I'll see you after services.
- Good morning, Dr. Marshall.
- Good morning.
It isn't that I grew soft and lazy on vacation.
It isn't that
I've prepared no sermon.
It's that ministers are mortal... and are subject to human weaknesses.
Suddenly, and for no reason that I can think of...
I'm homesick.
I want to talk about Scotland- that brave, that lovely little land... who, when parting with a son... keeps forever a piece ofhis heart.
No matter where a Scotsman goes... how high he climbs... or how low he burrows... there are times... as with me as I stand in this pulpit... when the smell ofrain-soakedheather... is so close in his nostrils-
I'll have to ask you to forgive me.
I know I'm acting very strange.
I'm feeling very strange.
I can tell you very little now,
Mrs. Marshall.
It might be a muscular spasm.
- It might be a coronarythrombosis.
- I don't know what that means.
It means that it could be very serious.
Very serious indeed.
- I'll call you this evening.
- Thank you, Doctor.
Excuse me. Okay.
Why can't I see Daddy?
Come, Catherine.
I'll driveyou home.
Come, Peter John.
When we came home,
Peter John and I prayed.
Peter John's prayer was simple.
All he asked was,
"Please don't let my daddy die. "
I asked that God would take away my icy fear.
The doctor's call told us the worst.
It was a thrombosis.
Peter had less than a fighting chance.
As word ofPeter's critical condition spread... a fountain ofprayer rose to the very heavens.
Letters and telegrams arrived by the hundreds... all with the same message-
"Praying for Peter. "
A few days later, the crisis passed.
Here we are at the end of the thi rd i nning of this nip and tuck ball game... with a score of Senators three,
Cleveland two.
This is gonna be a big year for us.
I'd preferyou took no rooting interest, Dr. Marshall.
In fact,
I could make it an order.
So you could.
But why?
Dr. Marshall, if you were an ignorant man,
I might try to deceiveyou.
But since that isn't the case,
I'm going to be frank.
You came very close to not pulling through.
Oh, I know that.
But don't hand yourselfany bouquets.
You had nothing to do with it.
God just didn't happen to want me.
Catherine, will you please resume walking like a normal woman?
I'm simply following the doctor's instruction.
Does he give ballet lessons on the side?
Oh, Peter, this is nothing tojoke about.
He only let you come home a week early on certain conditions.
No noise, no excitement... no walking up and down the stairs.
And you just can't be trusted.
I can't?
I left the house for an houryesterday- one hour- and you washed the dog.
Now, see how you exaggerate. Peter John washed the dog. I- I merely looked on.
The dog was washed in the basement.
You walked downstairs and you walked up again.
- And you called Miss Crilley.
- Well, that's only because... you've embroiled the poor girl in a conspiracy.
- She only gives me half my messages, half my mail.
Hello. Oh, hello,
Senator Harvey.
You're returning
Peter's call?
About a little bridge game this evening.
Mmm,just the three ofus.
You tell him to be around at 7:00 and to be on his toes.
About 7:00,
Senator Harvey.
This is going to be my first sermon when I return to my pulpit.
Peter.
You knowyou can't go back for at least a year, maybe longer.
I'm going back next week.
When God spared me, patched up my heart... he meant that he still had something for me to do on this side.
Peter, sometimes I think you want to leave us.
Don't be silly, Catherine.
I'll never leaveyou. Believe that.
And take the properview.
Years ago in the fog
I gave myself and everything I had... or ever would have, to the Lord.
And not in half measure.
My text is taken... from the first book of Kings... chapter 18 and verse 21.
If the Lord be God, then follow him: but if Baal, then follow him.
The leaders of ancient Israel... including the king, had come together to make a great decision.
It was a national emergency.
Elijah the prophet had summoned them to meet on Mount Carmel... to settle no less a question than whom they should worship.
William Penn has said that men must be governed by God... or they will be ruled by tyrants.
Here then was a Hebrew prophet... facing the very same issue and making his people face it with him.
They all knew the history of their nation... how God had led their fathers out ofbondage... into a new land as pioneers... how his holy law had been written into the nation's constitution... how the Ten Commandments had become for them a bill of rights... and a declaration of dependence.
Butsomething in the nation's life had begun to fade.
Moral decay hadset in.
They had begun to love things more than principles.
They had become materialists.
And materialism had a god... a god of the flesh... and his name was Baal.
Now, El ijah saw the danger.
He saw what would happen to the nation when its moral fiber was weakened.
So, he summoned the 450 prophets of Baal... the king and the nation's leaders.
It had to be either-or.
They had to get on one side or the other.
You remember the dramatic test, the trial by fire... how, on the parched, sunbaked slopes of Carmel...
Elijah announced his proposed test.
Let sacrifices be laid upon the altar.
Let him be God who would send down fire and consume the offerings.
And let Baal and his priests have the first inning.
Then began the weird, pagan performance... with Elijah jibing at them with pointed sarcasm...
"Cry louder, why don't you? Cry louder.
He is a god you are crying to, isn't he?
"Perhaps he's gone for a walk.
Per adventure he's asleep.
Cry louder.
Wake him up. "
All day long he taunted at them until hoarse with their shouting... wearied with their paganistic dancing, they were exhausted.
Yet no voice spoke.
No voice answered.
Then Elijah went over to an abandoned Jehovah altar... set upon it a sacrifice... and offered his prayer to Jehovah... not ranting or foaming or shouting.
And the answer came in fire which consumed the offering.
Then the people looking on cried as they fell on their faces...
"The Lord- He is God.
The Lord- He is God. "
Now, I suggest to you... that America needs a prophet today... a prophet who will set before the nation... the essential choices.
I n the words of that great poet and essayist, J. B. Holland...
"God, give us men!
"Men whom the lust of office does not kill...
"men whom the spoils of office cannot buy...
"men who possess opinions anda will...
"men who have honor; men who will not lie...
"men who can stand before a demagogue...
"and damn his treacherous flatteries without winking!
"Tall men, sun-crowned, who live above the fog... in public duty, and in private thinking. "
Millions of people in America... live in moral fogs.
They move in a sort of spiritual twilight.
Modified immorality, modified dishonesty... is the practice of millions more.
Surely the time has come for us to be honest about it.
Ifwe have thrown away our national heritage... ifwe no longer believe that this nation was founded under God... if, contrary to what is stamped upon our coins... our trust is not in God but in Baal, let us say so.
Let us, at least, not be hypocrites.
Yes, like the ancient Hebrew nation...
America needs a prophet like an Elijah... a prophet who will have the ear of America and who will say to her now...
"If the Lord be God, then follow him.
But if Baal, then follow him and go to hell. "
Let us pray.
- Good morning, Dr. Marshall.
- Good morning, Miss Fowler.
- You seem quite natural.
- I'm afraid so.
A little memento of your return.
Why, Miss Fowler.
May I open it?
Oh, nothing really.
Just a little button... that I clipped from an old jacket that I thought perhaps you might enjoy having.
Why, I'm overjoyed,
Miss Fowler.
Uh, did it come from someone in your family?
A family friend.
A Scottish immigrant.
His name was Jones-John Paul Jones.
Why, Miss Fowler, thank you so much.
I can't tell you what this means to me.
That was just her way of telling you that everything is all right.
And everything is. Good evening.
I mean, good morning, Dr. Marshall.
Against all my betterjudgment, may I present Senators Wiley and Prescott?
- How do you do?
- How do you do, gentlemen?
What do you mean against your betterjudgment?
- One of my best friends is a senator.
- Well, that's encouraging.
Doctor, we have a- for want of a better word- a proposition.
Uh, when would it be convenient for you to talk it over?
- It's rather urgent.
- It is? Am I being investigated?
Your head should be if you agree to listen.
Well, now I am curious. While I'm changing, why don't you go round to my study?
Not without Catherine.
Catherine?
Peter John, you gowait in the car.
I need her support.
Peter Marshall, Chaplain of the United States Senate?
I- I- I couldn't be more highly honored... or more taken by surprise.
And that this should happen today... the 1 Oth anniversary of my becoming an American citizen.
Peter, you can't consider it.
Peter, I oweyou a great debt... and I mean to repay that debt by keeping you from doing this.
I'm afraid we didn't realize the situation.
If the added duties of the chaplaincy would imperil Dr. Marshall's health... we'll merely express our deep regret... and to our colleagues tomorrow, our deep disappointment.
Naturally.
Much as we've wanted this, I-
- Thank you, darling.
- I'll be waiting in the car with Peter John.
The Senatewill be in order.
Our new chaplain,
Dr. Peter Marshall... will offer the prayer.
Our Father in heaven... we pray for the members of this body and their several responsibilities.
Make them see, dear Lord... that you are not the god of any one party... of any one nation or of any one race.
Teach us that freedom may be seen, not as the right to do as we please... but as the opportunity to do what is right.
Give us the courage to stand for something... lest we fall for anything.
Save us from hot heads that would lead us to act foolishly... and from cold feet that would keep us from acting at all.
Create new warmth and love between the members of the Senate... so that they may go at their work, not headfirst, but heart first.
Help us, our Father, to show other nations an America to imitate... an America that loves fair play, honest dealing... straight talk, real freedom and faith in God.
Help us make this
God's own country... by living like
God's own people.
Amen.
Catherine, I'm afraid you'll have to ask the blessing.
The Lord knows I'm not grateful for turkey hash, and I can't fool him.
# And for bonny #
# Annie Laurie #
# I'd lay #
# Me doon #
# And dee ##
- That was foryou, my love.
- Thank you.
And that concludes our concert for this evening.
It's already 45 minutes past Peter John's bedtime.
Gosh, Mom.
Daddy's home tonight.
Daddy's had a long, hard day too.
You run upstairs and brush your teeth.
I'll be up in a minute.
- Uh, Jeff hasn't had his walk yet.
- Yeah!
- Don't you want Daddy and me to take Jeff for his walk?
- No.
- Oh, let's all go, the four of us.
- Oh, boy.
Hi, Jeff!. Hi, Jeff!.
Why,just once, couldn't you go to bed early?
I will, darling, tomorrow night.
Not tonight.
How I love this place.
With all that isn't quite right about it, think of all that is.
You can feel it beating, the pulse of liberty for the world.
I'm so grateful to have been a small part ofit.
Catherine,
I'm in great pain.
Would you please call the doctor?
I'll call the ambulance.
I'll call from downstairs.
Sneaky fellow, isn't he?
I'll get dressed and come to the hospital with you.
No, you cannot.
You-You can't leave our son.
See you, darling.
See you in the morning.
I'm all clean- brushed my teeth.
What's the matter, Mommy?
Peter Marshall's final prayer.
"Oh, God, open our eyes...
"and let us see how simple a man's life can be.
Where we cannot convince"-
"let us be willing to persuade.
For small deeds done are better than great deeds planned. "
Amen.
With the summer,
Peter John and I went back to Cape Cod.
Mr. Briscoe had opened the house.
A friendly neighbor had launched Peter John's boat.
Nothing seemed changed.
Come on, Jeff.
The shutters Peter had painted were just as blue.
The little red roses he had planted were bursting into bloom.
Nothing seemed changed.
No! Peter John, no!
Peter John, you can't take the boat out.
- Why?
- You're too little, darling.
- Daddy didn't think so.
- But Daddy isn't-
Why don't you come with me?
Don't you remember?
I can't. I get-
Please, Mom, just this once.
Please?
A bonny boat.
Aye.
See you, darling.
See you in the morning.

I, Sally Adams, do solemnly swear... that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office... on which I am about to enter, so help me God.
Madam Ambassador, you are now the accredited representative of the United States... to the Grand Duchy of Lichtenburg.
My congratulations.
This is the proudest and happiest moment of my life.
I am proud because my duties take me to a country it has long been my dream to know and love... the glorious Grand Duchy of Lichtenburg.
Lichtenburg and the United States of America are both conscious... of the historic friendship that has existed between our two peoples.
I shall seriously endeavor to preserve that warm relationship.
And I shall strive with all my heart and strength... to bring about a closer unity between us.
Congratulations, Madam Ambassador.
- How soon do you leave us?
- Tomorrow morning.
And when do you arrive at your post?
I'm not sure. Hey, boss.
Where the heck is Lichtenburg?
- Step on it. She's on her way down.
- Hope I got enough light.
With Sally's diamonds, you don't need lights.
Hey!
- Mrs. Adams!
- Madam Ambassador.
Hold it.
Big smile now. Thank you.
- How about a statement?
- Tell us about it.
One at a time, boys.
One at a time. You tee off Johnny.
This way, Mrs. Adams.
That's fine. Thank you.
Mrs. Adams, as our new ambassador to Lichtenburg, is there any statement you'd like to make?
Yes there is. You can say for me boys, that the farewell party
I'm throwing tonight is gonna be a killer-diller.
And you're all invited.
End of statement.
- Hey. - Wow. - But Mrs. Adams.
Don't you feel that Lichtenburg should be included in some multilateral system...
- to promote exchange stability?
- He talks cute.
No, I mean, shouldn't Lichtenburg be brought into the IBRD?
You don't have to spell it out.
You can say it in front of these fellas.
- Seriously, Mrs. Adams.
- Okay, seriously...
I don't know what the h-
I don't know what you're talking about.
My city editor thought up those questions, not me.
But I would like to know how you got this appointment.
- That one I can answer.

Uh, Sally. You wouldn't like me to make a little farewell speech tonight, would you?
That's right. I wouldn't.
I hear you were wonderful in the senate today, Charlie.
- I didn't speak today.
- Everybody loved it.
Hi, deep and thoughtful.
Why aren't you dancing?
- Nobody asked me.
You're gonna be sorry you said that.
- Excuse me, Charlie.
- Surely.
Let's see. You're with the Morning Globe, aren't you?
Not anymore.
I'm going with you to Lichtenburg.
- With me?
- As your press attaché.
- Who hired you? - Nobody yet. But you're gonna need a press attaché.
- And I need a job. I got fired this afternoon...
- ls that a recommendation?
In a way. I got fired for writing nice things about your appointment.
- Yeah?
- Uh, no. I just made that up to impress you.
Actually, the boss and I did have a difference of opinion.
But it concerned a matter of eight bucks a week.
Well, I'm available, Mrs. Adams.
I think you'll find me useful.
I know quite a lot about European politics.
And you think I don't.
Is that it?
Well, I think you're gonna learn very fast.
- Well, thank you, Mr.-
- Mr. Gibson. Kenneth Gibson.
I can be cleared by the State Department in the morning, and be ready to leave by noon.
- Uh, no dice, huh? - Pardon me, Mrs.
Adams. You're wanted on the phone.
- Whoever it is, tell them to come right over.
- It's long distance, Mrs. Adams.
- You'll want this call.
- Oh. Thank you, Burton.
Sorry, kid.
I don't need a press attaché.
Wish I did.
Hello?
Hello, Harry.
How's everything in Independence?
Yep. I'm leaving in the morning.
What? Oh, sure.
The party's going fine.
I'm sorry you and Bess couldn't make it.
Is Margaret with you?
Denver? How did it go?
Even in Denver.
Well, the critics don't know everything.
She made money, didn't she?
Good. Harry, I'm afraid
I won't get to see you before I leave.
Yes, I'm gonna take this job very seriously.
Thanks, Harry, for everything.
Love to the family. Bye, Harry.
We're all ready for the newsreel shots.
We're set up in the den.
- Just a short talk. It won't take a minute.
- Talk? What will I say?
Oh, you know. What you intend to do when you get over there.
- A few facts about Lichtenburg. Anything.
- What do I know about Lichten-
Mrs. Adams. Excuse me.
Those notes you dictated.
- Notes?
- I think it's about what you'll need.
Oh, thanks, kid.
Uh, Kenneth here, Mr. Gibson, is my press attaché.
- He's going with me to Lichtenburg.
- Oh, splendid.
Okay, let's get it over with.
Now, Mrs. Adams. If you'll just step over here, please. You boys all set up?
And though as a diplomatic post, Lichtenburg's importance cannot be overestimated.
The country is no bigger than... Brooklyn?
While Sally's celebrated friends congratulate and wish her Godspeed...
they may recall the days when the fabulous
Oklahoma widow, new in Washington...
made her still widely quoted remark...
a remark that was to endear her in the hearts of the nation's capital.
I'll take the check.
But in the years to follow...
it was her simple forthright charm and native common sense...
that made her Washington's number-one hostess...
and brought to her home, leaders of society, leaders of the nation's government.

- That's not bad, huh?
- Seven hours late.
- What have you to say to that?
- I tried to get her to fly over with me.
You and your female ambassador.
Sir?
- Yes?
We finally have a report on Mrs. Adams.
- Well?
- She was in Switzerland last night.
- Switzerland? - And this morning at
8:00, she tried to cross the border into Italy.
She insisted it was Lichtenburg.
- Well, it's comforting to know she's found Europe. - Yes, sir.
This reflects on me.
I made an appointment with her... to receive the prime minister at I 2:00.
- Now it's after 3:00.
- Take it easy, Maxwell. She'll get here.
Gibson, you are talking to the embassy's chargé d'affaires.
Don't you think it would be more courteous to address me as Mr. Maxwell or "sir"?
Why, certainly, if it seems important, sir.
But I think you're going to find that Mrs.
Adams prefers informality in the office, sir.
Mrs. Adams' preferences interest me very little.
I fully intend to go on running the embassy while she remains quietly in the background.
Like to make a little bet?
Mr. Maxwell.
Oh. Sir.
Mr. Maxwell, about the presentation at the palace tonight...
- what should we inform the Grand Duke?
- Let's not bother the Grand Duke.
His Highness has troubles of his own.
Gentlemen, I see no necessity for all this talk, talk, talk!
We are agreed that the marriage is desirable for both countries. We are agreed on the terms.
- Otto! Not so excited.
- Please, Sophie.
I do not see how parliament could have made it any clearer.
When my niece marries Prince Hugo...
Here, I'll read it again.
"The dowry of the Princess Royal upon her marriage will be two million krobbles..."
"and her income will be tripled."
Well, Excellency, does that not answer all your questions?
All but one, Mr. Prime Minister.
The, uh-
Well. What? What? What?
Where is Lichtenburg going to get the money?
If I may be so blunt... your treasury is no better off than our own in Mittledorf.
The answer, Excellency, is simple statesmanship.
We will get an American loan.
The minister of finance means he will ask for an American loan.
- It amounts to the same thing.
- To be sure.
Now, and mind you, I'm speaking for my government rather than Prince Hugo... who, as you know, is not interested in material things.
He is simply a young man, wholesomely in love.
Now, I see no reason why this marriage should not take place immediately- uh, after these unpleasant financial details have been worked out.
Do not worry, Excellency.
When the lady ambassador gets here, there will be no problem.
We have very reliable reports that she's extremely warmhearted... tremendously generous and very inexperienced.
It will be... Oh.
She's here!
She has arrived!
My type.
Your Highnesses, if you will excuse us.
- We will be back immediately with everything arranged. - Good, good.
- Not bad, huh?
- It'll do.
- Say, this is quite a layout. - Yes, it was built by the Grand Duke's uncle, Count Maximillian... for his, uh... for a dancer he was crazy about.
Why, the old son of a gun.
- And, uh, this is your office here, Mrs. Adams.
- Oh?
- I'll go see about the trunks. Excuse me.
- Right.
Thank you, staff. Any problems, my door is always open. At ease.
Hello, I'm Sally Adams.
Who are you?
- The chargé d'affaires.
- Who?
I am Pemberton Maxwell. I'm in charge of affairs here at the embassy.
Oh, you're one of the office help.
You'll find me easy to work for.
Mrs. Adams, we might as well understand each other immediately.
- When I have appointments, I arrive on time.
- Well, bully for you.
Of course, I happen to have a diplomatic background... a family tradition of government service.
- My father was a public servant, so was my grandfather. - What do you know?
My grandmother was a servant too. She was a chambermaid at the Old Waldorf.
Call the duke and duchess, will you?
And tell them I'll drop in around 4:00.
Sort of get acquainted.
Mrs. Adams, apparently I'm going to have to teach you a great many things...
- you quite obviously do not know.
- You're gonna teach me?
Look at you.
Your coat and pants don't even match.
Oh, Mrs. Adams. The prime minister is here with the minister of finance.
Well, ask them to come in, Ken.
Mrs. Adams, in these matters of state it would be wise to consult me.
I could tell you, for example, they are desperate for an American loan.
Oh, I know all about that. They told me in Washington to turn them down.
Cold but diplomatic.
Come in, gentlemen.
Mr. Chargé d'affaires.
Your Excellencies, it is my pleasure to present to you... the representative of the United States of America, Mrs. Sally Adams.
- Madam Ambassador.
- And this is-
This is the proudest and happiest moment of my life.
Lichtenburg and the United States of America are both conscious... of the historic friendship that has existed between our two countries.
- Grab some chairs. - And if I may be permitted an extremely unofficial remark... off the record, as you say...
- the American ambassador is very beautiful.
- So beautiful.
Well, thank you.
A good optometrist could clean up around here.
- - Now, if the minister of finance may speak officially...
Mr. Tantinnin.
Madam Ambassador, we, too, are conscious... of the historic friendship that has existed between our two countries.
When one contrasts the wealthy and prosperous nation you represent-
- Not a dollar.
- With the position of my poor country...
- Not a quarter. - You must realize the need for a closer relationship between us.
Not a dime.
Of course, if you'd care to stick around for a few beers.
No. No, thank you.
But if we could only go back and tell the Grand Duke... that we have opened negotiations for an American loan.
- Okay, you open them.
- Oh, thank you. That's wonderful.
And I'll close them.
Madam Ambassador is jesting.
Yes. I'm sure we can come to some kind of an agreement that will be mutually satisfactory.
Ten will get you 20.
Drop in again, boys.
Madam Ambassador.
Mr. Chargé.
Well, I told them, didn't I?
Yes. And with such great finesse.
It strikes me that a woman with your enormous lack of experience, Mrs. Adams...
Call me "Madam."
- Madam.
- When you call me madam, smile.
Madam, I happen to be chargé d'affaires.
And I happen to be chargée the whole works.
Aw, look, fancy-pants. We have to work together. We ought to be friendly.
- You're gonna like me and-
- I prefer to keep our relations official, madam.
Okay, now we understand each other.
I'm the madam, and you're just one of the boys.
Yes?
Mr. Maxwell, the foreign minister is here.
- He wishes to see you immediately.
- Me?
I beg your pardon.
I'd expected to find you alone.
- May! address myself only to you?
- Certainly, General, certainly.
I would not think of calling on the American ambassador without an appointment.
But perhaps you would inform Her Excellency... that with all Lichtenburg,
I rejoice in her arrival.
She will be so informed, General.
Would you be good enough to add, that at Her Excellency's convenience... the foreign minister will be happy to make an appointment to receive her credentials.
- Forgive the intrusion.
- What's your hurry, General?
May, uh-
May! introduce myself?
- I am the...
- Pardon me, madam.
Your Excellency, it is my pleasure to present to you... the representative of the United States of America...
Madam Ambassador, Mrs. Sally Adams.
General Cosmo Constantine, secretary of state for foreign affairs... for the Grand Duchy of Lichtenburg.
Excellency.
Get lost. Get lost.
Here are my references.
This is the proudest and happiest moment of my life.
Lichtenburg and the United States of America... are both conscious of the historic friendship... that has existed between our two countries.
I shall seriously endeavor to preserve that warm relationship.
And I shall strive with all my heart and strength... to bring about a closer unity between us.

- I do not understand.
- How much money?

Madam Ambassador, I am convinced that the people of Lichtenburg... can and should help themselves without foreign aid.
- I would oppose an American loan.
- You're kidding.
- No, Excellency. - Well, seems to me, that's not a very friendly attitude.
Borrowing money is not always difficult, but paying it back.
Paying it back?
That is naive.
Uh, of course, all I can do is make a recommendation.
But, uh-
Sit down, General.
Thank you.
- Lovely room.
- Yes.
I understand it was built by the
Grand Duke's uncle for his cutie-pie.
Yes, that was quite a scandal.
Uh, I believe it is in this room... that the door to the secret passageway is located.
- Oh?
- Yes, somewhere along here.
Here it is.
It leads to the palace through the royal wine cellar.
Very interesting. It sort of gives the old room a romantic feeling.
Don't you kind of sense it, Excellency?
Forgive my digression, but, uh...
I would like to clarify my views on foreign policy... if the American ambassador is interested.
If she isn't, she ought to have her head examined.
I was just thinking that the American ambassador... might understand the foreign minister's views a little better... if she knew something about him.
Unquestionably. What is it that
Madam Ambassador would like to know?
Uh, is the foreign minister married?
No, Excellency.
Any other questions?
Just one. Does the foreign minister like roast turkey?
- We're having it for dinner tonight.
- Tonight?
With candied yams and cranberry sauce.
The foreign minister has a passion for roast turkey, with what you said.
But isn't it tonight that Her Excellency is going to the palace?
The palace?
Who's playing there?
No. Tonight...
Madam Ambassador and her staff will be presented at court.
Their Highnesses are giving a bail.
Oh, yeah? Oh, swell. Well.
I must jot that down.
Now, let me see.
- Tonight, presentation at palace.
- 8:30, Excellency.
Tomorrow night, turkey dinner.
7:30, Excellency.
I am very sorry.
I wish I were free tomorrow night.
- Friday night? Sunday, Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday? - No, I-
- Tuesday would be perfect.
- Fine.
Then we can talk more about the loan. Seriously.
You are the most American
American I have ever met.
That's the nicest thing anybody ever told me.
You couldn't have said anything that...
"The most American"...
Of course, I know there's a knock in there too.
Please translate into English this word "knock?"
You know, you think
I'm all right except...
Okay, I can take it.
What are the exceptions?
Well, forgive me, but perhaps for Americans, money is a little too important.
There are more valuable things than money.
That's what money's for, to buy them with.
- With money you cannot buy-
- What can't you buy?
Many things.
For one, love, a happy marriage.
I thought that marrying for money was sort of an old custom around here.
Yes, and in my own family for generations.
But to me, a marriage for money, something never to do.
- I learned that lesson when a child.
- You were married while a child?
I learned it from my parents, my grandparents, my uncles... my great-uncles, my cousins.

Mrs. Adams, about the presentation tonight.
I... Anything wrong?
- I just met General Constantine.
- And?
Wow.
Maxwell said this thing is strictly formal.
I've got everything but a high hat.
- Ken.
- I guess I'd better get one.
Oh, pardon me.
What were you going to say?
Wow.
Here we are.
- The Grand Duke Otto, he has one just like it.
- Is that so?
Oh, perfect.
Fits like a glove.
- I kind of wanted it to fit like a hat.
- Only 300 krobbles.
Three hundred? Bigger hat, smaller price, if you don't mind.
- Two hundred krobbles. Twenty dollars.
- Two hundred?
Ah, this is it.
That's fine. I'll take it.
- I will get a box. Just a few seconds.
- Thank you.
Oh, pardon me.
- Are you busy?
- No.
No. No, not at all.
Is that an American song?
Why, yes. It's a hit from a show that ran a couple of years on Broadway.
Could I hear the words, please?
Don't see why not.

- Mm-hmm. Me.
- You see, I, uh, I really don't work here.
- Oh.
- Your Highness.
- Oh.
I am still looking.
Thank you.
- I will call.
- Your Highness.
Well, I...I guess that makes us about even, Your Highness.
I...I mistook you for somebody professional.
An actress or a dancer.
Oh, yes? That is very odd. Because I've always wanted to be an actress or a dancer.
- Oh, really?
- I'm afraid it is very improper for me to-
Oh, forgive me. I'm Kenneth Gibson of the American Embassy, Your Highness.
I am terribly sorry.
This may sound pompous.
- But until we are formally presented-
- Oh, I understand perfectly.
The first thing you learn in a State Department job is protocol.
Why, we shouldn't even be talking at all.
- We are not anymore, are we?
- Oh, no.
The thing that threw me...
Well, I had no idea that the Princess
Royal would be travelling about alone.
Oh, I am not alone.
My equerries.
They would like to stay closer to me.
I can understand that.
But I enjoy the feeling of privacy.
The people, don't they all know you?
Oh, yes. But they are considerate and kind.
They pretend they do not notice me.
Why, I think I could do almost anything.
Dance, sing, stand on my head even... and no one would look at me.
That's hard to believe.

- I hope you're not as upset as I am.
- About what?
All these sordid formalities, dowries, income.
It would be wonderful if we could run away like simple peasants and marry tomorrow.
- No? - I cannot pretend I am dying of impatience, Your Highness.
- We scarcely know each other.
- My mother did not meet my father... until three days before their wedding.
- Have they been happy?
- Well, uh-
Your Highness should not listen to backstairs gossip.
Besides, things would have been entirely different if our country were not so poor.
Which reminds me. I understand the
American ambassador will be here tonight.
Yes, with her staff.
Your Excellency, Their Highnesses will receive you in a very few moments.
I'll wait.
- Are you sure you know what to do, madam?
- I curtsey at the door...
Bending the left knee, keeping the back straight, the head up...
- with under no circumstances a wobble.
- Okay, no wobble.
I step inside and curtsey again.
Why? I'll never know.
I walk to the throne and curtsey again, for Pete's sake.
- Then I hand the Grand Duke my recommendations.
- Your credentials.
Okay. I hand them to him. Then
I tell him how glad I am to be here.
And he tells me how glad he is
I am here. I make out I believe it.
Then maybe he says, "Sit down." In that case, I tell him a couple of jokes...
- Please.
- I'll keep it clean.
When he gets up, I get up.
I curtsey again, no wobble.
And just to make sure I haven't got a chance, they make me wear this.
I don't mind a train, but they shouldn't have given me the super chief.
- Good evening.
- General.
I am very sorry, but the delay is unavoidable.
His Highness has been resting.
- A slight indisposition.
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
- Uh, we could make it some other time.
Their Royal Highnesses... the Grand Duke and
Grand Duchess of Lichtenburg.
- - Now, now.
No need to be nervous.
You go ahead, Cosmo.
I'll be fine.
You just be yourself and Their
Highnesses will find you enchanting.
Curtsey in here, in there.
Then I walk to the-
The ambassador and her staff will now be received.
Okay, boys. Here we go.
Where are my credentials?
- I have them here, madam.
- Oh. - Mrs. Adams.
- Yes? - Don't you want to get the train back on the track?
Oh.
I do want Harry to be proud of me.
Her Excellency, the Ambassador from the United States of America.
I must have wobbled.
My credentials, Your Highness.
And I want to tell you how happy I am to be in this Grand Duchy of Lichtenburg.
I think one reason is it just so happens that one of my ancestors was Dutch.
So you can understand how happy I am to be in this Grand Duchy... and to meet all you grand Dutchmen.
- Dutchmen?
- Does she think we are Dutch?
We are Lichtenburgers,
Madam Ambassador.
Yes, of course.
Extremely amusing, Madam Ambassador.
So amusing.
Your Excellency.
Why don't you sit down, Highness?
I understand you've been under the weather.
Well, these are very trying times for small nations.
But I imagine the wise ambassador from a much more fortunate country knows... what would make me feel a great deal better.
- Am I right, Excellency?
- Could be.
Tomorrow I'll send you a bowl of nice, thick chicken soup.
It's my grandmother's recipe.
Do you know that she never once called a doctor in 40 years?
Of course, she did owe him money.
And now, if it's all right with you,
Your Highness... there's a member of my staff who hasn't been presented yet.
He's a nice kid.
Mr. Kenneth Gibson.
Your Highnesses.
Your Highness.
- The interview is over, madam.
- Oh.
Well, it's sure nice to have met Your Highnesses.
- Uh, Your Highness, is it proper for me to-
- Oh, no. No.
- I must ask you.
- Oh.
I hope you're enjoying your stay in Lichtenburg, Mr. Gibson.
- I'm not, Your Highness.
- No?
Well, you see, it's extremely personal,
I'm afraid, not protocol.
You may tell me.
Well, they'd never believe this back home, not in a thousand years.
- What? - Well, I met a girl, and
I can't get her out of my mind.
Is that so unpleasant?
Ordinarily, no. But, uh-
Well, this is like a fairy tale without much chance for a happy ending.
You see, the girl turned out to be a real honest-to-goodness princess.
You dance very well, Mr. Gibson.
I'll shut up, Your Highness.
Cosmo, I'm getting very fond of Lichtenburg.
Well, you couldn't have arrived at a better time.
Our annual fair opens next week.
- Yeah? I hear that's quite a shindig.
- Oh, yes. Very colourful.
Much to see. The Princess Royal leads our dance festival.
You will enjoy it, Excellency.
- What is it? I have said something?
- Oh, this "excellency" business.
Isn't it about time the foreign minister started getting less foreign?
You say such amusing things.
I wish I could understand them.
I shall have to spend some evenings with an English-American dictionary.
You name the evenings, and I'll be over.
- May I, Excellency?
- Of course, Your Highness.
I have not danced for years.
- But in honor of the American ambassador-
- Oh, you're doing fine.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
Well, now you're really groovy.
- Yeah?
- One, two, three. One, two, three.
- Fine.
Tell me just how does this reception differ...
- from your famous Washington parties?
- Well, we have a good time.
Uh, I mean, we're less formal.
- You know, everybody sort of pitches in and...
Look. Why don't I just show Your Highness?
Why, yes.
Please do, Excellency.
Got anything hot, maestro?
- Hot?
- Yeah. You know, sizzling.
Oh, yes. I know what you mean.
Something up-to-date?
We have it. Let's see.
Here it is.
An American song.
Irving Berlin.
- "The International Rag."
- Hmm, 1913.
Well, that's fairly up-to-date.
Let's give it a whirl.
- Real razzamatazz, Highness.
- Razzamatazz.
Excuse me.
- Hit it, boys!

No. No, it was not. It-
Good night.
You know, Sally, you have brought a new vitality to Lichtenburg.
The old vitality suits me fine.
General. Forgive me, Excellency.
- At your convenience, could His Highness see you?
- Of course.
Go ahead.
Maxwell's right here.
As you say in America, okay.
You are going to permit me to take you home?
Sure. Where do you live?
- It's a pleasure to watch them work.
- Work?
When those old-world diplomats are good, they're magnificent.
So beautifully sly and devious.
Surely, madam, you don't suppose the foreign minister's attentions are purely personal?
You mean, you don't think he likes me?
To be perfectly candid, I doubt the question has even entered his mind.
With these fellas, there are only two kinds of people: those who can serve their purpose and those who can't.
You, madam, as the ambassador of a rich country...
If you're referring to the loan, let me tell you something.
Oh, I'm quite sure I can tell you the same thing.
He said he didn't want a loan-
- that he would oppose accepting a loan.
- Yes, he did.
The "hard to get" method.
They don't miss a trick.
You don't suppose they're discussing the weather?
- Mrs. Adams, if you don't mind-
- Ken, I-I think we'd better go.
I'd like to.
- Yes?
- You wanted to see me, Mrs. Adams?
Yeah, I'd like to hand the president a few laughs.
Will you dream up a funny cablegram for me?
You know, about the presentation.
Tell him about my pratfall.
- I will, Mrs. Adams.
- I'll appreciate it, kid. Be out in a minute.
Yes, ma'am.

The lady ambassador is late.
I don't know. What do we gain by waiting for her?
This, Mr. Sebastian, is a job for a man who understands women.
Oh. Here.
Let me talk to her alone.
You'll see.
- Madam Ambassador.
- Your Excellencies.
- Hi. - Your presence adds so much to the beauty of our fair.
So much.
- Thank you.
- Now, if madam will enter the official car.
We thought it might be more fun walking.
Oh, no. This is an honor you cannot deny us.
Okay. See you boys later.
To the royal box.
What about your sidekick?
Doesn't he go along?
Well, you see, we have a saying in Lichtenburg...
"Alone at the fair with a lady fair..."
- "no greater delight anywhere."
- That so?
Madam Ambassador, you're a diplomat from a great country.
But to me, you're also a woman.
Very interesting point of view.
When I'm with a lovely lady,
I forget all problems of state.
I forget budgets.
I forget foreign loans.
Ever try a memory course?
You know, it is spring,
Madam Ambassador.
I know. We've got a calendar at the embassy. Cut it out, Excellency.
Forgive me. I'm trying to control my ardent nature. But madam-
I said cut it out, Mr. Tantinnin.
- I want you to call me August.
- Well, that'll be soon enough.
- I'll get out here, driver.
- Your Excellency.
Look here, buster. I thought this was the foreign minister's racket.
If he hasn't got a chance, nobody has.
Thanks for the ride, August.
- Mrs. Adams!
- Cosmo!
Uh, Your Excellency.
- Are you alone? - Yes. Tantinnin was taken out in the first inning.
He was plenty fast, but a little wild.
- I-I beg your pardon.
- It's nothing important.
Well, it was nice seeing you.
- You are not going to walk unescorted?
- I thought it might be safer.
- I'm meeting people. - I was very sorry you were unable to come with me, Sally.
- Why?
- Well, we have a saying in Lichtenburg.
- "Alone at the fair with a lady fair..."
- I know all about that.
It means I may be the ambassador, but I'm also a woman.
A woman of very refreshing charm.
From a country with very refreshing money.
- What made you say that?
- A hundred million reasons.
Quite a fiesta you're tossing here.
Yes. Such a pity. This might be our last fair for a very long time.
- Unless you can raise more money. - The problem will be solved if my program works out.
I'll bet. This program of yours, it's a little like Tantinnin's, isn't it?
Hardly. Tantinnin is an impatient schoolboy... interested only in immediate results.
- Our methods could not be more dissimilar.
- I can see that.
I don't know why it is
I always seem to fall for heels.
- This I do not understand.
- I find it pretty puzzling myself.
- Well, let's stick to the subject of money. Tell me... - Sally...
- I'm going to ask a great favour of you.
- That figures. Let's hear it.
Stop talking about money.
You're a very clever man, Cosmo.
Won't you let me get you something to eat?
Look. If you weren't the foreign minister,
I mean, just some guy that I'd met, I'd say yes.
But as it is,
Yes.
Oh, Your Highness. Eh,
Emil! Heinrich!
Mr. Gibson is with the American Embassy.
A thousand pardons, sir.
That's all right.
I enjoyed the trip.
Well, I-I'm very sorry.
My equerries are overly conscientious.
But they're very considerate.
They didn't break either arm.
Well, uh, good-bye, Mr. Gibson.
- Good-bye?
- We have got to be sensible.
It is not permitted for me to talk to a young man in public.
I'm willing to make it private.
Yes. But it is not possible.
You see, even if I do not marry Prince Hugo, I...
- Are you going to?
- Those decisions are not left to me.
I am not a private citizen.
Oh, I know.
You're going to inherit a throne.
Look, Maria, I don't think I've slept three solid hours since we met.
I, too, have not slept very well.
Oh, I believe you have met Mr. Gibson,
Your Highness.
Oh, yes. You seem to have been discussing something very fascinating.
No.just insomnia.
We both have it.
I wondered what you two have in common.
- Good day, Mr. Gibson.
- I-I'm in no hurry, Your Highness.
I'm-I... Oh, yes, yes.
I-I guess I am.
Well, good-bye.
Good-bye.
Mr. American?
I do not think I care for your attitude toward the Princess Royal.
Oh, I'm sorry, Your Highness.
It's hard to please everybody.
Uh, Gibson, I'm a man with a rather violent temper.
That's a pity.
Bad temper can get you in trouble.
Perhaps. But more likely, it can get you in trouble.
I'm gonna give you some very sound advice.
Leave Lichtenburg.
Hmm. You know, I'm not sure your advice isn't worse than your temper.
Oh, Hugo.
I think we had better get back to the box.
Uncle Otto will be wondering.
I've just indicated to Mr. Gibson... that his attentions to you are far from discreet.
I think he is right, Mr. Gibson.
In that case, he is.
Nah! Caught you again.
But, young man, that is Slivitzberger.
- If you're not used to that...
- I'm getting used to it. Now...
Also, it is much past midnight, and we would like to close.
Well, that's very sensible of you.
Very sensible.
Just as soon as I finish... this.
Sure. A man's got to be sensible.
Like falling in love with a princess.
Hmm Love.

I know you are sad, but,
Sad? What's there to be sad about?
- I'm a happy boy.
Hello! Get me the police!
Hurry! Quick! The police!
The police!
Send Mr. Gibson in right away.
Mrs. Adams...
I am in.
I, uh-
- I thought you'd want to see me.
- I do.
I've got a report here intended for Washington. It's about you.
- Maxwell, huh?
- And it's a lulu. Especially this part.
"After being released by the police because of diplomatic immunity..."
"Gibson fell asleep in a gutter."
"On being awakened, he publicly bellowed an announcement..."
"of his engagement to the Princess Maria."
- Well?
- I-I don't think it was a gutter, Mrs. Adams.
Otherwise, I guess the report is pretty accurate.
Look. With the possible exception of myself... nobody in this office is expected to act like a knucklehead.
How long do you think you'll last here if this goes to Washington?
About as long as I deserve.
- Headache?
- A pip.
And the royal family isn't helping it any.
Look, Mrs. Adams,
I'd just as soon go home.
Well, on your way, stop by my bathroom.
- You'll find some aspirin there.
- Thanks.
And, uh, Kenneth... save this for the wastepaper drive.
Never mind.
I'll do it myself.
Thank you, Mrs. Adams.
Madam, the foreign minister's office called to confirm his engagement Tuesday night... for, um, your turkey dinner.
Relax. Relax.
It's business.
Oh, naturally.
The diplomatic pouch is ready to go.
Have you signed my report on young Gibson?
Oh, yes. Your report.
I think it's in here.
Madam, you certainly aren't gonna treat this lightly.
Gibson's actually been trying to date the princess.
The Grand Duke is highly exercised.
What about? After all, they let Princess
Margaret go out with Danny Kaye.
Permit me to warn you. If there's any interference with this royal marriage...
- Sebastian will protest to Washington.
- Sebastian.
Look, fancy-pants, have you ever been in love?
If you'll read the book of foreign service regulations...
I don't think you'll find "love" listed as a justification for disorderly conduct.
I've read the book of regulations... and it says that I'm supposed to take a complete inventory... of everything in the embassy.
I did, and you're shy four dish towels... an egg beater and nine bed sheets.
Is madam under the impression that I am the housekeeper here?
No comment.
- Anything else?
- Yes.
Slither back to your desk and write...
"I won't be a tattletale" 500 times.
Yes? On the phone?
Well, I should say so.
Put her on.
Hello? Hi, honey- uh, Your Highness.
I've been wanting to talk to you.
Yes.
Certainly, Princess.
I understand.
Yes. Oh, I think that's a fine idea.
I'll be glad to tell him.
Not at all, Princess. Bye.
- Ken.
- Mm-hmm?
- I want you to do something for me.
- Sure.
- You know about this underground tunnel thing to the palace? - Yeah.
Well, they're sending someone over with a message. I want you to get it for me.
- A message?
- It's very confidential.
Oh.
- It's dark in here.
- Here, take this.
- Got a match?
- No. Got a lighter.
- I still can't see.
- Then take off your glasses.
- Your Highness.
- Hello.
- B-But Mrs. Adams said-
- I know.
I told her I had to see you.
She was very sweet.
Oh, I'm not complaining.
Kenneth, Prince Hugo has been making very bad threats... about what he would do to you if we met again.
That's very good news. I didn't think there was a chance we'd meet again... but you weren't really worried.
Well, not too much. I think mostly it was an excuse for seeing you.
Darling. Oh.
Oh. Here.
There. Now I can see you better.
Maria, you can't marry that guy.
I am not going to.
There is no money for the dowry... and I understand there definitely...
- will be no American loan.
- Yeah, but what if there is?
Is it not silly to bother about things that will not happen?
I would like you to kiss me.
- Look. Maria-
- Ah.
That was a command.
Well, I guess there's nothing else to do but obey.
Oh, Kenneth. Oh.
I like being in your arms.
I remember at the presentation,
I was so afraid you would not ask me to dance.
That's something you'll never have to be afraid of.

- Yes?
- Madam, the foreign minister just phoned.
- He's on his way over.
- Fine.
- Tell the butler we'll have cocktails up here.
- Yes, madam.
And, uh, Maxwell... it might be a good idea if we're not left alone.
I want you to sort of hang around.
Well, I must say, that's an astonishingly sound suggestion.
It's very wise to have a witness present at high-level discussions.
Yeah. And just to be polite,
I'll probably hint that you get out.
But no matter what I say, just pretend that you don't understand.
I confess I misjudged you, madam.
This is what I'd call real diplomacy.
Oh, and before you come in... you might give him a couple of minutes to say hello.
I understand perfectly.
And, uh, Maxwell, how do I look?
I never thought I'd say so, madam, but,
Hello? Oh, yes.
Put it through.
Hello?
Hello, Harry.
How are you?
How's Bess?
Good. And Margaret?
You mean to tell me they've got critics in Galesburg, Illinois?
Hmm.
Oh, not bad, Harry... but they're trying to slip a fast one over on me.
Yeah, the man I told you about- the foreign minister.
Is he a smooth character.
Don't worry, Harry.
I'm having him over to dinner tonight.
I'm gonna tell him off but good.
I've got a speech all memorized, and it's a honey.
Bye, Harry. Love to the family, and thanks for calling.
Bye.
Now, see here, Cosmo.
We're gonna put our cards on the table.
If there's something you're after, why not come out and say so?
The foreign minister, madam.
Sally, my dear.
Hi, Cosmo.
Now, see here, Cosmo.
We're gonna put our cards on the table.
Must we play cards?
Uh. Other attractive men have tried to influence me... and not one has failed- uh, succeeded.
If I may use one of your expressions, what the devil are you talking about?
I know what's on your mind.
Why not be straightforward and direct about it?
Well, of course.
Uh, what I mean is... if there's something you're after... why not come out and say so?
Well, you know, that was probably the first time... a foreign minister ever kissed an ambassador.
We've made history.
- Cosmo.
- Yes?
I, uh,
Let's make more history.
Forgive me, Excellency.
Uh, madam, they're typing that report to Washington. It will be right up.
What report?
Oh. Thank you, Maxwell.
- You needn't wait.
- Oh, I don't mind. Not at all.
- Maxwell.
- Yes, madam?
The situation has changed- really changed.
Don't you understand? Blow.
Mrs. Adams likes service.
Maxwell, those instructions
I gave you-
They'll be carried out, madam.
You may be sure of that.
Oh, have you heard the very amusing story they're telling at the hofbrau?
- We heard it.
- Yes, very amusing.
Look, Maxwell, the general and I are gonna have a cocktail before dinner.
Oh. You must permit me to mix them for you.
- But I don't want you-
- I insist.
- Now, what'll it be?
- Murder, I think.
That's a drink I'm afraid
I don't know.
A little brandy, a dash of scram... some "et-gay,” "out-gay,”
'ick-quay" and an egg.
Then you beat it. Beat it!
- There doesn't seem to be an egg.
- Then get one, you lunkhead!
Poor Maxwell.
It's just nerves.
He needs a vacation.
- Uh, Cosmo.
- Yes?
I realize that whatever you're doing is for your country.
Nobody can be blamed for that.
Well, if through my job I can help you.
Darling, your generosity's charming.
You are charming.
But in diplomacy, an impersonal attitude is the best thing.
Best thing for who... uh, whom?
For you, me, everyone.

Ooh. Did you have to wear one with points on it?
Madam Ambassador, please.
Oh, your call, madam.
It is ready.
Hello. Harry? Sally.
Well, he just left, and...
Oh, yes. Very satisfactory.
Uh, Harry... do you think we can spare $100 million?
- From Washington.
- D.C.
Delighted to see you, Senators.
Welcome.
- Well, how are you?
- I'm Pemberton Maxwell...
- senior officer at the embassy.
- Glad to know you, sir.
- Where's Sally?
- You know Mrs. Adams. She's at the caterer's.
Very busy preparing for tonight's party.
- Oh, a party, huh?
- For us?
For anybody. Mrs. Adams' parties require no explanation.
Uh, great gal, Sally.
- Oh, yes, indeed.
- Yes.
- Come in, gentlemen.
- Thank you, sir.
Gentlemen.
Come. We'll get our hats.
But the party does not start for five, six hours.
So we come a little early.
- This is Mrs. Adams' office.
- Oh, yeah.
Make yourselves comfortable, gentlemen.
The guest rooms aren't quite ready.
- Not the most efficient staff in the world.
- No hurry.
I understand you gentlemen are here as an investigating committee.
Yep. That's the general idea.
Thank you.
Well, I'm prepared to talk.
- What about?
- The-The ambassador.
And what passes for her management of the embassy.
Are you knocking Sally?
I-I'm afraid you misunderstood.
I-I admire her, enormously.
Yes.
Splendid woman. Very able.
But, uh, you are here to investigate?
- Yeah, a loan to Lichtenburg.
- Welcome to Lichtenburg.
Uh, may I present the Prime Minister of Lichtenburg, Mr. Sebastian... and the Minister of Finance,
Mr. Tantinnin.
- Senators Gallagher, Brockway and Wilkins.
- Gentlemen.
I'll, uh, see about your rooms.
Excellencies, I know that you Americans do not like to waste time.
But we will not rush. We will sit down before we discuss the loan.
But what about-what's his name-Mrs.
Adams' friend? Our plan was to talk to him.
Oh, yes.
Cosmo, the foreign minister.
He's the opposition leader.
He's a very difficult man.
Also, Excellencies, the negotiating of loans... that is the business of the prime minister exclusively.
That's too bad.
Our ambassador thinks very highly of this Cosmo.
She seems to want us to deal with him.
- She does?
- Cosmo?
- Will you excuse us, please? We'll be right back.
- Just for one minute.
Make sure there's plenty of hot dogs... and ketchup and mustard and all the condiments on the table.
- Mrs. Adams.
- Oh, Ken, I left the senators at the bar.
- Kind of see that they have fun, will you?
- The loan-it's going through?
Got my fingers crossed.
What do you suppose happened to him?
Cosmo, what are you doing in here?
Fascinating book-your State Department's foreign service regulations.
Yeah, it's a book I always curl up with at parties.
I was particularly interested in this chapter... on American consuls and ambassadors who marry citizens of foreign countries.
Got any particular consul or ambassador in mind?
Darling, there is something
I have wanted to say.
Mr. Sebastian, madam, and members of the cabinet.
Just don't forget what you were going to say.
- Come in, boys. Glad you could make it.
- Excellency.
- Excellency.
- Cosmo, the government has fallen.
- No.
- Yes. Congratulations, Mr. Prime Minister.
- Congratulations.
- Very good luck.
Is this true, Sebastian?
The cabinet felt that only you... could solve the problems of Lichtenburg.
We are very happy for you.
Very happy.
Excuse me, please.
It's wonderful news, Cosmo.
Thank you, Sally.
Gentlemen, I have only one question.
Will I be given an absolutely free hand?
Mr. Prime Minister, is a party the place to discuss politics?
- Where is Tantinnin?
- Probably at the bar.
The cabinet meeting was very exhausting.
- If you will excuse us.
- It's out in the garden.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Well, this gives me a chance to carry out my program.
- But I wish I knew what they were up to.
- Don't you worry, Cosmo.
If the deal I've been working on goes through... you can even run for grand duke.
Madam Ambassador.
Ah, Mr. Prime Minister.
Congratulations. My heart is so happy.
- Thank you, Tantinnin.
- I would've come in immediately... but I've been talking to the American senators.
- They will see you now.
- Now?
- Now.
- What about?
They're waiting in
Her Excellency's office.
They're on your side.
Go in and level with them.
I don't understand what the big hurry is.
Sooner the better.
I can't wait to get at those hot dogs.
- Sally having hot dogs?
- And beans.
Look, boys.
We've got to watch ourselves.
This Cosmo strikes me as a very smooth customer.
Oh, come in, Mr. Prime Minister.
Sit down, won't you?
Well, thank you.
Now, uh, we're very fond of Sally...
Uh, Mrs. Adams.
- Everyone is.
- And she likes you.
But you've got to realize this is government business.
How about $50 million?
- Well, I do not think I understand.
- Pretty cagey.
Could you understand a loan of 70 million?
No. I made my position clear.
I thought you knew.
Okay. We're here to approve a loan... but this is final. 100 million.
Gentlemen, I must gratefully, but emphatically decline.
I-I request no loan.
I accept no loan.
Do you mean to tell us this country couldn't use $100 million?
Oh, we could use it, but...
Well, gentlemen, I will be frank to the point of indiscretion.
I appreciate your generosity in wanting to help Lichtenburg... but if my country is on the verge of bankruptcy... it is because very drastic reforms are needed.
Now, with outside help, these reforms would be impossible.
You must not lend my country one penny.
Well, how's he doing?
Sally, the prime minister has made a profound impression on us.
- Good.
- Boys.
- What did you tell them, Mr. Prime Minister?
- The truth, Mr. Sebastian.
Swell. It's going to work out fine.
- Don't you think so?
- Right. Yeah. I'll tell 'em.
Gentlemen, we have been in many European countries.
We have talked to the heads of many governments.
They have been all too eager to reach down into Uncle Sam's pockets.
Today, for the first time, we have met a statesman.
We have finally met a man who has said,
"Don't give us any money."
No, huh?
We have tremendous admiration for your prime minister... and we have only one way of showing our gratitude.
We're going to lend Lichtenburg
$200 million.
Bravo! Bravo!
On behalf of the cabinet, we happily accept.
And we vote the prime minister our lasting gratitude... for his very successful negotiations.
Gentlemen, I cannot say that I have enjoyed my ten minutes as prime minister.
Of course, I resign, and I request that parliament... be called into session as soon as possible.
Good night.
- But r-r-resign?
- Why? I don't understand.
- My hat, please.
- Cosmo.
- Cosmo, I'm sorry... - I do not understand how you could do this to me.
Things I have fought for all my life, you have in one day destroyed.
Cosmo, if you really didn't want the loan-
Oh, I know you said you didn't.
All right. I didn't believe you. I...
- Thank you.
- I thought it was, well, old-fashioned diplomacy.
Anyway, I wanted to help you.
Helping people in my country is what got me where I am.
Yes, it got you out of your country, into my country.
- Good night.
- Cosmo, have a heart.
I love your country.
I love you.
I was trying to help both of you.
What's so wrong with that?
Wrong with it?
Justice, Mrs. Adams.
So long as I have any voice in the matter...
Lichtenburg is not for sale.
What is it, Kenneth?
Bad news?
Well, I-it doesn't have to be.
I just heard the loan is going through.
- Oh.
- Maria, this isn't the 17th century.
- That marriage contract...
- I gave my word, Kenneth.
- If I I'm to inherit the throne-
- But suppose you don't?
Maria, you're beautiful, you're charming and I adore you... but do you honestly think you have any special talent for ruling a country?
The fact that you do not consider me bright...
No, I-I didn't say that. I...
I-I'm the one who isn't bright.
To even suggest that you give up the throne-
A guy earning my salary, it's crazy.
Your salary. I wish that were the problem.
I wish it weren't. Back home, my apartments a lot different from the palace-
Two rooms.
It's not very big.
And the maid only comes in once a week.
You make it sound very attractive.
Oh, sweetheart.
Of course, the maid could come in twice a week.
Even once would be an intrusion.
What do you say?
I-I love you.
And good-bye?
Oh-
Come in.
You too, huh?

- Welcome home.

- What's the matter with you?
- Sally thinks she's in the doghouse.
Why? You saved us
$200 million, didn't ya?
You can thank Cosmo for that. He got his parliament to turn down the money. I didn't.
What's the difference?
He's your friend.
- So you get some of the credit.
- Thanks boys. You can have my share.
- Sally.
- Excuse me.
I don't know why she feels that way about it.
- Hello, Ken.
- Sally, I just came from the State Department.
Constantine is the new ambassador from Lichtenburg.
- Cosmo?
- He's just arrived in Washington.
No! This is the best news I've had in...
Why didn't he let me know?
Hmm. I couldn't say.
Well, come on, Ken.
What is it?
Well-
You're gonna find out anyway.
They told me that he sailed over with a woman.
Oh.
Uh, probably just a shipboard acquaintance, don't you think?
He's bringing her here tonight.
I can understand him falling for somebody else... but why should he bring her here?
Oh, well. Come on. Let's have a good time. How about a drink?
Sure.
His Excellency, the minister from Magrador.
- You go ahead. I'll be right out.
- All right.
- My gracious hostess, welcome home.
- Hi.
His Excellency, the ambassador from Lichtenburg.
Hi.
- Sally.
- How are you, Cosmo?
- I've never been happier.
- So understand. Enjoy your trip?
Enormously. I had the most charming companion.
- How charming.
- She's getting off her wrap.
She'll be right in.
I suppose I should have waited...
- but I was so eager to see you.
- That was real peachy of you.
The honorable
Miss Hammenschlaffen.
- Hello, Mrs. Adams.
- Princess!
- Oh, am I glad to see you.
- Didn't I tell you I had a charming companion?
Gee, this is certainly a...
He's here.
Outside somewhere.
Oh, Cosmo.
Do you still have to wear that thing?
Yes, while I perform an official and very pleasant duty.
Ladies and gentlemen... may I have your attention for a moment, please?
General! Glad to see you!
Senator. Gentlemen.
Pardon me.
Quiet, everybody, please!
Mrs. Adams, as a token of Lichtenburg's great esteem... the Grand Duke has asked me to confer upon you... the Order of Philip I.
This order entitles you to be called a dame.
A dame?
Say, that's quite a promotion.
Hello.
- Your Highness.
- I use our family name now, Kenneth.
It's Hammenschlaffen.
Well-Aren't you getting married?
Next week, I expect.
Oh. Th-Then I suppose you'll be going right back?
Not if I get married here.
I've renounced the throne, Kenneth.
We have Uncle Otto's blessing.
Darling.
And let me add, sir, that we are delighted by your appointment... and extend to you our heartiest welcome.
Thank you, Senator, and thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
The Grand Duke seemed to think it was a good thing for Lichtenburg... and unofficially, I think it is the best thing for me.

I would like to say a few words about weddings.
I've just been through one.
Not my own. My daughter's.
Someday in the far future
I may be able to remember it with tender indulgence, but not now.
I always used to think that marriage was a simple affair.
Boy and girl meet, they fall in love, get married.
They have babies, eventually the babies grow up, meet other babies, they fall in love and get married, so on and on and on.
Looked at that way, it's not only simple, it's downright monotonous.
But I was wrong.
I figured without the wedding.
Now you fathers will understand.
You have a little girl.
She looks up to you. You're her oracle.
You're her hero.
And then the day comes when she gets her first permanent wave and goes to her first real party, and from that day on you're in a constant state of panic.
If the boys swarm around, you're in a panic for fear she'll marry one of them.
If they don't swarm around, why, of course you're in another kind of a panic, and you wonder what's the matter with her.
So you don't worry about it.
You say to yourself, "I've got plenty of time to worry about that.
"I'll just put off thinking about it."
And then suddenly it is upon you.
It was just three months ago, exactly three months ago, that the storm broke here.
It was an ordinary day, very much like any other day.
I had caught the commuters' train home, as usual.
It was late, as usual.
We own our own home in the suburbs, at least we almost own it.
Had it built when my law firm made me a full-fledged partner.
As usual it was Ellie who was the first to greet me.
She asked me what kind of a day I'd had, and I asked her what kind of a day she'd had.
And our Delilah, she was always the same.
Another kitchen crisis, but that's routine.
- Oh, hi, Dad.
- Hello, son.
May I have the keys to the car?
- Yeah. Be careful now.
- Okay.
Good night.
As usual, Ben wanted the car.
Ben's a nice, steady boy in college, studying engineering.
Hi, Pop.
- How you doing?
- Hi.
And Tommy. No worry about him, except to try to keep him fed.
It was "hi" and "goodbye" that night, but I'm used to that.
I was wondering if my daughter had deserted us too, when I heard her voice.
Pops! Pops!
- Hi, Pops.
- Kay was our only daughter.
I know a father's not supposed to have favorites, but when it's Kay...
- Mmm, you smell good.
- You like it?
- What's that?
- An atomizer.
- Where'd you get it? A present?
- Mmm-hmm.
- Who from?
- Oh. Somebody.
What's happened to you?
You look different.
- I do?
- Yeah.
You look all lit up inside.
You're not wearing your usual deadpan look, that "how did I ever get into this family" look.
Oh, Pops.
I know. You've been taking those vitamins that Dr. Gray sent you.
That's right.
I guess I'll get me some of those vitamins.
I'll get it, Delilah!
What's the matter with her?
She seems kind of queer.
I don't know. Maybe she's in love.
- In love. Who would she be in love with?
- I haven't the wildest idea.
You must have some idea or you wouldn't have mentioned it.
Well...
Buckley.
- Who?
- Buckley.
- Buckley who?
- You know that boy.
Buckley something-or-other.
I don't know his last name.
Never heard of him.
Oh, of course you have.
He's been here again and again.
- That doesn't mean anything.
- All right, I'm wrong.
Sorry. Forgive me.
- Who was it, dear?
- Buckley.
- He's coming for me in a few minutes.
- I'll get your coffee.
- Where did the boys go?
- Ben had some date, and Tommy went for basketball practice.
Oh, Delilah, will you bring the coffee, please?
Yes, Miss Banks.
Wouldn't you think those boys would stay home once in a while?
Ben's not a boy, Pops. He's a man.
- He's old enough to have a family.
- At 19?
Buckley says that's not too young for a man to marry.
I didn't marry your mother till I was 25.
Oh, I know, Pops, but that was millions of years ago.
Look at all the men in Ben's class at college.
Loads of them are married and have children.
GI's.
Buckley says everyone should marry young.
Did Buckley happen to mention who was going to finance these child marriages?
Oh, he says the family should support them.
He says it's really economy in the long run.
The men work better and the babies are healthier.
From the way she talked about this Buckley, you'd think he was Moses and
Einstein and Gallup all rolled into one.
I tried to remember which one he was.
There'd been so many boys who had beat a path to our door.
Which one of them was Buckley?
Was it the boy with the teeth?
Or the guy with the porcupine hair?
Or the English teacher, that poop-a-doop that Ellie liked?
I hoped he wasn't that muscle-bound ham with the shoulders.
And she'd never fall for that bebop hound.
It couldn't be that genius who said he'd fix my radio.
She couldn't do that to me.
Couldn't be the radical.
He hadn't been on a picket line in years.
Surely my daughter wouldn't fall for any of them, or would she?
Since the country's in better shape...
She was still going on about him.
Buckley has it all figured out.
He says there isn't going to be any depression.
Oh, that reminds me.
I won't be home for the weekend.
- Where are you going, dear?
- I'm spending it with Buckley's family.
Uh, are you going to marry this character?
I guess so.
And just when are you planning on getting married?
Well, I really don't know yet, Mother.
It all depends on Buckley's plans.
Maybe months, maybe a few weeks, or maybe any time at all.
We can't tell yet.
But there's one thing, we won't be pinned down.
Buckley's very decided about that sort of thing.
He just won't be pinned down.
I hope that Buckley won't think I'm too nosy if I ask a few simple questions.
Okay, Pops.
I suppose we have to go through this.
- It seems to me...
- Who is this Buckley anyway?
- Now listen, Pops...
- And what's his last name?
- I hope it's better than his first one.
- Now listen...
Where the devil does he come from, and who does he think is going to support him?
If he thinks I am, he's got another thing coming.
- I don't give a hoot...
- Stanley!
Stanley, you don't have to shout.
Nobody's deaf.
It's mortifying, with...
Right in there. Please.
The idea, acting like an outraged father.
Sorry. You broke it to me so casually, over the ice cream.
You might have at least waited until I got the coffee.
Thanks, Delilah. I'll pour it.
- You don't give Kay a chance.
- Now listen, Pops.
I'm 20, and Buckley's 26, and we're grown people.
And as far as your supporting Buckley,
I'll tell you this right now.
He's the kind that wouldn't let anyone support him.
He'd rather die first.
That's the kind of a person he is.
He's a wonderful person.
He's the kind of a person that's absolutely...
I mean, absolutely independent.
Buckley wouldn't come to you for help, not even if we were starving in the gutter.
And his name is Dunstan.
That's what it is. Buckley Dunstan.
And he's a wonderful businessman.
I mean, a really wonderful businessman.
- And he has a wonderful job.
- Doing what?
I don't know, Pops. He makes something.
Does it really matter what it is?
He's the kind of a person that can do anything, anything at all.
He's... He's...
Absolutely terribly wonderful.
Stanley, you've hurt her.
You know, while she was talking, all I could think of was a little girl in brown pigtails and dirty overalls, flying at the boys when they pushed her too far.
Seems like such an incredibly short time ago.
Go speak to her. I'm afraid she's crying.
Kay.
And as for his parents,
I'll tell you this right now, Pops.
They're just as good as you and Moms.
They're fine people, and they live in Westbridge.
I guess you'll agree that Westbridge is just as good a place as Fairview Manor.
Oh, I don't see what that has to do with it anyway.
Okay, kitten. I love him already.
What'd you say his last name was?
Oh, Pops!
Stanley! Come away from that window.
I want to get a peek at this Superman.
How nice. Come in.
- Stanley.
- Good evening, Mrs. Banks.
Kay will be down in a minute.
She went up to get her things.
Won't you come in and sit down?
- Well, I...
- Stanley?
Stanley.
Darling, you remember Mr...
Somehow I can't call you Mr. anything.
You won't mind if I call you Buckley, will you?
Please do.
Good evening, sir.
- How are you?
- Fine.
- And you?
- Fine.
Kay's just been telling us some very exciting news.
I hope you don't mind.
No, indeed. We're delighted.
Aren't we, Stanley?
It's wonderful, so exciting, having a romance right under our...
That is, well, you might say, right in our midst, isn't it, Stanley?
- Stanley.
- Hmm? Oh, yes.
I'm afraid it was a little sudden, but I couldn't...
- Hello there.
- Hello.
- Was I too early?
- Oh, no.
Better put on your heavy coat, there's no warmth in that thing.
Pops, I'd die in that heavy coat.
I'd simply smother to death.
- Just the same, I'd wear it.
- Oh, Pops, don't fuss.
- I'll be perfectly all right.
- I think you'd better take it.
- You do?
- Yes.
Okay.
Right then I realized that my day was over.
She'll always love us, of course, but not in the old way.
From here on her love will be doled out like a farmer's wife tossing scraps to a family rooster.
- Good night, Moms.
- Good night, dear.
Good night, Pops. Oh, don't wait up.
We'll probably be late.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I don't like him.
Oh, darling, I know he isn't good enough for Kay.
But then no one is or ever will be.
At least he's head and shoulders above all her other beaus.
That's certainly a great recommendation.
Now, Stanley, she's old enough to know her own mind.
Old enough? That child?
You didn't mind that I was only 18 when I married you.
- Oh, that's different.
- That's different.
Oh, she'll make a beautiful bride.
She has just the coloring and figure.
I know exactly the dress she should wear.
It was in last month's Vogue.
I couldn't believe it.
Ellie was as happy as a lark.
She wasn't worrying about this Buckley.
Her mind was on the wedding.
Some of them can make you look simply ghastly.
But this was perfect.
I'll find it for you.
It had just a touch of eggshell pink.
What's the matter, darling?
Can't you sleep?
- No.
- You want some hot milk?
- No.
- Well, then, good night.
- You're wonderful.
- Thank you, darling.
If Kay was out at some little dance somewhere, you wouldn't close your eyes until you heard her come in.
Now, when it's a question of whether she's gonna eat for the rest of her life,
- you go to sleep like a baby.
- Eat? You want something to eat?
I am talking about Kay, Ellie. Kay.
She sits there tonight and says, "I'm going to marry Buckley. Isn't he cute?"
And we all dance and make faces.
What do we know about him?
Darling, if you're gonna sit up, you better put on your robe.
We don't know a thing about him.
Not a darn thing.
Not where he comes from, what he makes, or what he makes making it.
Only thing we know about him is his name, and you weren't too sure about that.
Yet he walks in, and we hand him Kay.
Darling, you only have to look at him to know that he's nice and that he comes from a nice family.
He calls you "sir" and holds my chair for me.
That reminds me, I must call his family tomorrow morning, tell them how happy we are.
Is that all you need?
Is that all you need?
That he holds your chair for you and that he says "sir" to me?
Is that all you want?
Well, it isn't all I want!
I want to know whether he's going to make her happy.
Whether he's going to make a home for her, can he support her?
You heard his ideas on marriage, didn't you?
He thinks the family should support them.
And you know which family he means, don't you, honey?
He means us.
Sure, sure, he figures on moving in with us.
Then when the food gets a little bad, he'll dump the kids on us and skip.
Probably done it before.
Probably got a wife somewhere else.
Read about those things all the time.
Fellas have wives in three or four places. Families.
How do we know?
Maybe he's got a criminal record.
Fella might be a counterfeiter or a confidence man.
Those are the ones, those smooth-talking ones that have the manners.
Manners are their stock-in-trade. Yeah.
Those soft-spoken fellas who look you right in the eye and would put a bullet in the back of her neck and never turn a hair.
You mark my words, this is going to end in tragedy.
But, Stanley, I...
I got it off my chest.
Funny, the minute you get someone else worrying, you stop worrying yourself.
Come in.
Well, you're an early bird.
How you could sleep last night
I don't know.
I couldn't close my eyes.
I was so upset about Kay.
Kay? What's Kay done now?
Oh, I kept thinking about what you said.
Suppose he is a good-for-nothing.
Suppose he doesn't mean to make a home...
Oh, now, stop worrying, Ellie.
Stanley, you've got to have a talk with him before this thing goes any farther.
You've got to come right out and ask him about what he has and everything.
Oh, darling, I can't do that.
I can't walk up and say,
"How's your bank balance, kid?"
- Why not? You're her father.
- I know, but even a father...
Stanley, I believe you're afraid of him.
- Well, that's a fine remark, I must say.
- Stanley, Kay's up.
You tell her you want to see this boy and see him right away.
- Finished?
- Mmm.
- Hi, Pops.
- Hi.
- How are you?
- Fine.
Uh, Kay?
Uh... About Buckley.
What about him?
Oh, I think he's great. Fine.
Nice clean-cut chap.
- Thanks.
- Yeah.
I thought, you know, we might have a little talk.
I thought I'd talk to him about what he's earning, you know.
You're kidding.
I didn't believe they really did that.
- Thought it was just a gag.
- Well, you know, after all, when a man's only daughter is gonna be married...
Okay.
If you want to go through all that old-fashioned rigmarole, it's okay with me.
- When do you want to see him?
- Well, what about tonight?
- We have a date at 9:00.
- Why don't you ask him to dinner?
Then we can talk before dinner.
About 6:30?
Okay. I'll deliver him.
Kay, you know, tell him we're just gonna have a little chat.
Don't make it sound too formidable.
I don't want to frighten the boy to death.
Oh, don't worry about Buckley.
He's big enough to take it.
Hi.
Hi.
Oh.
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Mrs. Banks.
I hope you'll forgive us.
It's Delilah's night out, and Kay and I are cooking dinner.
We might even put you to work.
I have an apron...
Oh, not now, Mother.
Let him get his talk with Pops over first.
- Talk? You're gonna have a talk?
- Yes, a talk.
- Oh.
- Where's Pops?
- He's in the living room, I think.
- Come on.
- Here he is, Pops.
- Oh, hello.
- Good evening, sir.
- Make it snappy.
Dinner is in half an hour.
- Sit down, sit down.
- Thanks.
- I'll take that.
- Thanks, but I'll need the papers.
- Okay.
- Kay said you wanted to talk to me.
Yeah. Would you like to have a little drink first?
No, sir.
- Smoke, then?
- I have some, thanks.
- Will you?
- No, thanks. I'll smoke a pipe.
Wonderful thing, a pipe. You smoke a pipe?
No, sir.
I like a pipe, especially after a hard day.
All the rush and fuss.
It sort of changes your pace.
- Rests you.
- Yes, sir.
- Are you comfortable there?
- Yes, sir.
I brought some papers that I wanted you to...
Oh, I suppose you think it's kind of silly, this financial talk, but I want to tell you that I wish my father-in-law had sat down with me before Ellie and I got married.
- I think it sort of clears the air.
- You're right, sir.
You sure you wouldn't like a little drink?
- Yes, sir.
- You would?
- I mean, yes, sir, I'm sure I won't.
- Oh.
- Where were we?
- Oh...
We were talking about your father-in-law.
Oh, yes. Well, someday...
I think that I probably understand, you know, the problems of young couples, what they're up against, of course.
Matter of fact, the parents are up against it too, what with high prices and high taxes and everything.
The long and short of it is,
I think that probably you're entitled to know what you can expect from me just as I'm entitled to know what I can expect from you.
Sort of get to know about each other.
- Yes, sir.
- Yes.
So, my proposal is this.
I thought I'd tell you a little about my set-up, and then we could go into your financial picture.
Yes, sir.
Well, in the first place, Buckley, you look around at this house and everything, and you probably think,
"Well, he's pretty well-off."
But let me tell you, my boy, that doesn't mean a thing.
The day I married Ellie, my position with the law firm of Bartham, Henderson and Peck was as nebulous...
In half an hour,
I told him more about my affairs than I had told Ellie in a lifetime.
Well, you take all of those things, the insurance, the mortgages, the kids' schooling, straightening Tommy's teeth, they all sound tough, but as I look back upon it
I think it was good to assume some responsibility.
- Gives you something to work for.
- Yes, sir.
Now, if you'd like to look at some of these papers that I brought...
Come on, you two. Soup's on the table.
We'll have to go into that another time.
We mustn't keep Kay waiting any longer.
- Did you have a nice talk?
- Wonderful. Wonderful.
I feel much better about everything.
Don't we, son?
- Yes, sir.
- Run along now, son.
Don't keep Kay waiting.
He's a smart boy.
Got a good head on his shoulders.
Fine business sense.
I should say he has.
When Kay told me he'd saved $5,000, and being the head of his own company at his age.
You see how silly we were to worry?
Come on.
This is the street.
Too bad Kay couldn't have picked her in-laws from somebody we knew instead of somebody we never laid eyes on.
- Bet they won't even have a drink.
- What makes you think they won't?
Mmm, just that kind of people, I'll bet.
What if they don't?
You're not an alcoholic, are you?
I don't know why you get yourself in such a lather at the thought of meeting the Dunstans, anyway.
I'm not in a lather. Who's in a lather?
- Ought to be around here someplace.
- Bet it's a shack.
Here it is. 394.
There's your shack.
I have a feeling they're behind those curtains watching us.
- Good afternoon.
- Good...
May I have your coat?
Thank you.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Good to see you.
- How do you do, Mrs. Banks?
Well, well, look at this.
There's the wedding, sure has gotten us.
I can't tell you how crazy we are about your Kay.
We feel just the same way about Buckley.
Yes, he's a wonderful boy.
Well, I'll tell you one thing, he's a lucky boy to get a girl like Kay.
- Would you like to wash your hands?
- I washed them before I came.
- Shall we go in?
- Yes, will you...
We did more bare-faced lying in those few minutes than we had done in our entire lives.
I sent Kay and Buckley out to dinner.
I thought we could get better acquainted if it were just the four of us.
It's much cozier this way.
I don't know how you feel about it, but would you like a little snifter before dinner?
- I beg your pardon?
- I have some Madeira here.
Put it down 25 years ago.
Been saving it for a special occasion.
I must say, I don't know of a more special occasion than this.
- Here we are.
- Thank you.
I think we should drink to the bride and groom.
Hear! Hear!
Not too sweet, yet not too dry.
I've been trying to decide whether Buckley looks like you,
Mrs. Dunstan, or Mr. Dunstan.
Oh, do please call us Doris and Herbert, not Mr. and Mrs. Dunstan.
Stanley and Ellie.
- Play golf, Herbert?
- Well, I play at it, Stanley.
Well...
- I love your house, Doris.
- Oh, thank you, Ellie.
I'm crazy to see yours.
Buckley's always talking about it.
- A little more, Stan?
- Just to help you out, Herb.
There we are. Now that we're all friends,
I'll tell you something.
- I was scared stiff about this meeting.
- Herbert.
Big argument this morning.
Should we or should we not offer you a drink?
I was all for it, to break the ice, but Doris was against it.
Afraid you wouldn't approve.
Stickly situation, you know.
We didn't want to start off on the wrong foot.
Now I'll tell you something funny.
Ellie here must have changed her clothes three times.
- Stanley.
- Well, you did, didn't you?
I wasn't so scared
I had to stop and get a martini.
- Martini? Is that your drink?
- Well, I...
Then why are we wasting time with this?
Come on!
Now, then.
Well, well, well! Look at that.
Look at that, Ellie.
Well, well, what do you know.
- Can I help you, Herb?
- Well, thanks, Stan.
The minute I laid eyes on your boy,
I liked him.
And now that I've met his mother and father, I like him even more.
I'm sure that the Dunstan-Banks family are gonna be as one from now on.
And now I want to hear all about our new daughter.
- There's nothing to tell, really.
- Oh, nonsense!
Would you like to hear about the time Kay was a baby and Ellie left her out in front of the grocery store in the carriage, went home and forgot all about her?
- It's the truth, though.
- There's a drop left, Stan. How about it?
Kay was about nine months old.
I know every father thinks his daughter is wonderful, but I want to tell you,
Kay was really something.
She was five years old when I gave her her first swimming lesson.
She was absolutely wonderful.
Not frightened a bit.
You know how Ellie is about the water.
Kay takes after me.
After all, a daughter takes after the father and the father takes... Vice versa.
- Isn't that so, Edith?
- Doris.
- Huh?
- Doris, dear.
Doris, yes. Oh, Doris!
Oh, imagine. I said Edith. Where did I...
Well, anyway, she just took like a duck to water.
Like a... When she was about six,
I started taking her out to the raft with the other kids and throwing her in.
Yeah.
She'd just plop in.
Diving in, she calls it.
She was only 15 when the boys started crowding in.
They were all over the house.
I used to come home at night and find a stranger sleeping on the sofa in the living room and one in the hammock on the porch and one...
And then, all of a sudden, she seemed to lose interest in them.
- And then...
- Then she met Buckley.
- Now you must tell us all about Buckley.
- Yeah, tell us all about Balky.
Well, Buckley was always a good boy.
A thoughtful, sweet boy.
Even when he was only five
I remember him saying,
"Mummy..." That's what he used to call me, Mummy.
He said, "Mummy, you won't ever die, will you, Mummy?"
How sweet.
He was a good boy but he wasn't any angel.
He could hold his own with any of the kids in the block.
And he loved sports.
How that boy loved sports...
It is the duty of the bride's family to give a party to announce the engagement.
Apparently this is done only after everyone knows it.
- Ready?
- It's only 5:00.
You got everything you need?
I borrowed every glass ever made.
Oh, everything's fine, everything's fine, everything's fine.
In fact, I made a lot of martinis.
That's all anybody ever drinks at these things, you know, martinis.
Now, Ellie, after I bring in the drinks, and everybody's got a drink and something to eat, then I'm gonna come in ringing the bell.
Oh, yes, ringing the bell.
And you call for silence, then I'll make the speech.
What do you think of this?
I thought I'd start out,
"Uh, friends, when I was a very young lawyer..."
They're starting to come. Excuse me, dear.
Oh, they're coming?
Friends, when I was a young lawyer,
I made a speech and the man got 10 years.
Now with today's... Oh! Oh!
Well, I see I found the right place.
How are you, Banks?
How about a couple of old-fashioneds to start things off?
- How about a couple of martinis...
- No, thanks. That's very kind of you, but a couple of old-fashioneds would be fine.
I just fixed these up to take out there.
Well, well...
- Tom Collins, please.
- Bourbon and soda.
Wouldn't you like a martini?
Martinis are awful nice.
I hope you have better luck than I did.
I spent 5,000 on my daughter's wedding.
Six months later she was on her way to Reno. Thanks.
Two old-fashioneds.
Dixon, old boy, how've you been?
Hiya, Stanley.
I see they got you working at last.
Two bourbons in plain water.
How about a nice martini?
- Stanley, Doris and Herbert are here.
- Doris and Herbert who?
- Hello, hello!
- How are you?
- How are you?
- I've got your drinks all ready.
If you don't mind, I think it's a little early for a martini.
- We'll have scotch.
- I don't think I've got any scotch.
No scotch? Bourbon? Yes, of course. Sure.
Too early for a martini?
- Hi there, Stan.
- Hello, hello. Hi.
The girls want three old-fashioneds.
What do they think I'm doing in here, filling prescriptions?
Where are the drinks for the Dunstans, Mr. Banks?
Right here. There you are, Delilah.
Now, four old-fashioneds.
- When are you going to make your speech?
- Soon as I can get in there.
Enjoy your minute in the limelight.
It'll be your last.
From now on the gals take over.
You think they can't add two and two.
When it comes to weddings, they're giants of industry.
They put it on like a big theatrical production, too.
The bigger the better.
From now on, your only function is to pay the bills.
No, no, this is going to be a very simple wedding.
I'm warning you, keep it with family.
Weddings are either confined to the bosom of the family or held in Madison Square Garden.
Got my drinks ready?
- Yes, right here.
- Thank you.
- Here.
- Thank you.
- How do you do, sir?
- How do you do?
Nice party, isn't it?
I don't know,
I haven't been out there yet.
Now what do you want?
Couple of dozen frozen daiquiris?
No, I'd like a couple of martinis, sir, if it's not too much trouble.
Did you say martinis?
Here. Here. Have a couple and pass the rest around.
- Why, thank you, sir.
- Say, could I have a couple of Cokes?
- Couple of what?
- Cokes.
Couple of Cokes.
Couple of Cokes.
Here, sir, let me.
Thank you, sir.
Five mint juleps, if you please.
Can I help? It'll speed things up.
Oh, no. No. No.
No, I like doing this. It's my hobby.
You were right about that.
Tom Collins, please.
I'll have four rum and Cokes.
Another bourbon and soda.
Good night, Ellie.
Wonderful party. Wonderful.
Well, you're a big help, I must say.
Where have you been?
Where do you think I've been, shooting pool?
Why must you always leave everything on my shoulders?
- Has everybody gone?
- Of course. It's almost 8:00.
- I haven't made my speech.
- Well it's too late now.
Now, now, Ellie.
You can't do that to Stan.
You can't deny this man the right to announce his daughter's engagement.
You don't realize what a delicate condition he's in.
He's about to become a grandfather.
Come on, Stan. Let's hear your speech.
"As I look at all the old faces
I used to shake hands with...
"Wait for the laugh."
Come on. Let's get one of those martinis.
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
We finally got around to discussing the wedding.
Well, then, we're all agreed.
It's going to be a small wedding.
Ellie?
Small wedding, huh?
Yes, of course, that's what we all want, a small wedding.
- A small wedding and a small reception.
- Mmm.
That's what I want, too.
- Oh, come on, Buckley. We've got...
- Kay, you're not leaving now?
I've got a million things to talk to you about.
I never get you two alone.
We've got to make plans.
We've got to set the date, we've got to make the arrangements about the church...
The church? The what?
- You're not planning on a church wedding?
- Of course.
You weren't married in a church.
We were married in your front parlor in a blue suit.
- That's just it.
- Just what?
Look, whose wedding are you talking about, yours or Kay's?
Haven't you got some schoolwork to do?
- Why not May or July?
- May's too early.
- Ellie, what do you mean?
- I'm going to camp in July.
This isn't a kids' party.
It's my wedding and my friends.
No one has to raise a finger.
When the time comes, I'll do everything.
I mean everything.
Ellie! Buckley!
Now, look here, young man.
If you insist upon a church wedding, you can count me out.
- I wash my hands of the whole affair!
- Stanley!
You two run along.
We'll talk about it tomorrow night.
Don't worry about it. It'll be all right.
Stanley, I don't know what's the matter with you.
We're having a simple little talk about the wedding and you fly off the handle.
Now, Ellie, you heard Buckley.
You heard Kay, didn't you?
You said yourself it was going to be a small wedding.
I know, darling, and it's going to be a small wedding.
With the things you're talking about?
Bridesmaids and churches and automobiles and flowers and heaven knows what.
But, Stanley, all her friends are given weddings like that.
If her friends want to go out and bankrupt themselves, that's their business, not mine, but we've always lived very simply, within our means.
Now here, what are we going to do?
Put on a big show, a big flashy show that we can't afford?
Stan, there's only one time in a girl's life that she can be married in a bridal dress.
Just once, and I don't want Kay to miss it the way I did.
Miss it? Miss it?
Don't you think I wanted a wedding with all the trimmings?
Then why didn't you have it?
Because you didn't want it, so I pretended I didn't either.
And you've been brooding about it all this time?
No, of course not, but I have thought about it.
You go on out and buy yourself a wedding dress
- and I'll marry you all over again.
- I'll be satisfied to see Kay in one.
Stanley, I don't know how to explain, but a wedding, a church wedding, it's what every girl dreams of.
A bridal dress, orange blossoms, the music.
It's something lovely for her to remember all her life, and something for us to remember, too.
From then on, I was a dead duck.
You should've seen it from the back.
- The look on the poor man's...
- Hi, Pops.
Hello, darling.
I'm sorry we're so late getting home.
- We had a very busy day.
- Pops, just wait until you see these.
Delilah, did the dress come for me today?
There were six or seven packages.
I left them upstairs.
Pops, wait till you see this one.
How about I show you these slippers?
They were such a bargain.
Yes, darling, look, if you could let the clothes carnival go for a minute.
- Have you got the list yet?
- The list?
Yeah, the list. I have to have it to give Miss Bellamy at the office.
She has to get the order in for the invitations and the announcements.
Aren't these pretty?
- The list, darling. Have you got the list?
- Yes, I have it right here in my bag.
The bag is here. Here's the bag.
Look, Stanley, isn't that lovely?
That's what the bridesmaids are going to wear.
- Aren't you afraid of the cops?
- It should give the idea of spring, of wood nymphs and glades.
- Like the girl on the White Rock bottle.
- Here's the list.
- Kay, Kay!
- Two...
- Kay? Kay? Hi. Where is she?
- She's upstairs.
- Kay, what did you get today?
- Come up, see my new evening dress.
"Two spectator sports suits, one spectator sport..."
This is no list.
This is something to do about clothes.
"Two country suits, trousers, suit and shoes to match.
"Two town suits, trousers, shoes to match.
"Two afternoon dresses, shoes, bags to match.
"Evening dress, shoes and bags to match.
Jewelry to match.
"One hostess dress, four negligees, hats, furs, six snuggeries,
"raincoat, a dozen slippers..."
- What is this?
- Wrong list.
- It's her trousseau.
- Her trousseau?
- Is she going to get all that?
- Of course, dear.
- But her closets are bulging already.
- She can't wear those old things.
Darling, you know what "trousseau" means?
It's from the French.
It means a little bundle that the bride carries under her arm to her new home.
How sweet. I've got good news for you.
The church is free.
The church is...
Well, I'm glad something's free.
I mean it's available on the 10th of June.
You mean we pay for the church?
There were some telephone messages.
I left them on your desk.
A man called about doing the flowers for the church and the reception, and Mrs. Gibbons left the name of her dressmaker,
- and the candid cameraman called...
- Candid cameraman?
- Thanks, Delilah. I'll look at them later.
- The candid cameraman?
Ben!
How do I look?
If you take your hands out of your pocket,
I could tell. Come down, let me see.
Turn around.
Oh, it fits perfectly. That reminds me.
I've got to get yours out of that trunk in the attic.
- Like it, Pop?
- What are you doing?
- Are you getting a trousseau, too?
- Didn't we tell you?
- Buckley asked Ben to be his best man.
- Oh, he did, huh? $150?
Why didn't he pick on one of his own friends?
I thought it was swell of him.
I hardly know the guy.
It's only two syllables from Banks to bankruptcy.
Hello? The what?
- An orchestra? You got the wrong number.
- Wait, Stanley.
Hello, are you the orchestra
Mrs. Parkman recommended?
How many of you are there?
That sounds very nice.
The 10th of June.
I'll be hearing from you then. Goodbye.
Stanley, from now on, don't answer the phone.
- An orchestra? Are you out of your head?
- For the reception, darling.
We have to have some music, and it only costs $85.
Oh, only $85? Oh, only $85?
What are people gonna say when I'm in the gutter because I tried to put on a wedding like a Roman emperor?
While my secretary went over the list of wedding guests,
I went over the bills.
Yeah.
Before I order the invitations,
I thought you ought to know how many people Mrs. Banks is asking.
- A hundred?
572? There must be some mistake.
Of course, Mrs. Banks doesn't mean to ask them all to the reception, only 280 of them.
The rest just get asked to the church.
Only 280 come to the house?
The house won't hold 280 people.
I was talking to our accountant.
He's married off four daughters.
He breaks each of his wedding guests down into units, reception units and church units.
Each reception unit includes the cost of champagne, caterers,
- tips, flowers, extra insurance...
- Insurance?
Oh, breakage and fire, cigarette burns, that sort of thing.
Broken down that way, he said the cost of each reception unit comes to $3.75.
- A couple?
- A head.
$3.75 a head?
Thank you, Miss Bellamy, and good night.
$3.75 a head.
I want to tell you one thing, there are going to be 150 people invited to this house for the reception and not one more.
I don't care how many you invite to the church, pack them in, build a grandstand if you want to, but the 151 st person who comes into this house is going to be thrown out on his neck.
They're not my friends.
I wanted a small wedding.
Stanley, there are loads and loads of people you just can't ask to the church.
They'd be insulted.
It's no longer a question of insulting people.
This is a question of survival.
Now come on, let's put an "x" next to the names of the people we have to absolutely invite to the reception, we throw the rest out.
Come on now, let's get to work.
I can't be any help.
I've already cut my list absolutely to the bone.
Here's someone, the Sandways.
We never see them anyway.
As for that woman with the dyed hair,
I don't care if I ever see her again.
Harry Sandway just happens to be one of the best friends I have in the world, besides being one of my very best clients.
Oh, Pops, a client.
Harry Sandway would go to the ends of the earth for me, and I for Harry.
What about cutting down a little bit on this Garden Club of yours?
We could get along without them.
Stanley, we have to ask them.
They're running me for president.
Oh, I thought a wedding was supposed to be a joyous occasion.
This is a business convention.
- What's the matter with her?
- She's nervous.
All women are nervous.
Yes? Come in.
- Hi, Pops.
- Hi.
I'm sorry about the way I acted.
That's all right.
It's my fault. I was a little tough.
We're all unstrung by this wedding business.
All this fuss and worry.
I never wanted anything like this.
I just wanted a small wedding.
That's what we all wanted, but it kind of got out of hand, didn't it?
All this money. I feel horribly.
- You know, kitten, I had an idea.
- What is it?
I don't know if it's any good or not, but I thought...
I was wondering, if I gave you and Buckley about $1,500, how would you like to elope?
Elope?
Yeah, you know, tomorrow or the next day you run off somewhere...
Pops, eloping, sneaking off and getting married,
I'd feel sort of, well, as if something were wrong.
As if you didn't like Buckley and didn't want me to marry him.
- Oh, kitten, I don't think it would...
- To get married by the justice of peace in some dirty little office with you and Moms not there?
I don't know, Pops, but...
I don't think I'd feel as if
I were really getting married.
- Well, it was just an idea.
- Stanley.
Forget about... I'm coming, Ellie.
- Pops, if you're worried about the money...
- No. Just forget all about it.
Forget I ever mentioned it. Forget it.
Stanley, you've just got to help me.
I'm going crazy trying to cut this thing down.
Take Bob and Betty, for instance.
If we ask them, we have to ask the Dixons.
If we ask the Dixons, we have to have the Warners.
Mother, let's call the whole thing off.
Let's not have the wedding.
- Kay, what are you talking about?
- Buckley and I could run off.
- We could elope.
- Elope?
Look, I told you that I didn't want you to talk about that eloping nonsense anymore.
Now stop it. Stop it. The poor kid.
She's worried, afraid I'm spending too much money.
Kay, you wouldn't do that.
You wouldn't elope.
Why, it would break my heart.
- Why, of course she wouldn't.
- But Pops, you...
Now I've heard all about this I care to hear. Stop it. Stop it, really.
Look, we're not going to cut these down at all.
Not cut them down at all.
We're going to invite all of them.
- Oh, Stanley, can we afford it?
- Of course we can afford it!
After all, what is money for if it isn't to give my daughter the finest wedding that's ever...
What are you trying to do, get me in trouble?
Ellie had dug up one of those little caterers.
He was willing to take the whole reception over and take us over, too.
This has been a very successful cake.
We made that for Brenda Santanya.
You know, the daughter of the Princess Schwazese,
- by her second husband.
- Yes, the Princess.
- Delightful person, isn't she?
- Yes, charming.
This is another we made for the Stoppenshutts for their nuptials.
- Do you like that, Mrs...
- Banks.
Perhaps I better get your name and the date first.
- Will you step over here, please?
- Ellie, Ellie, Ellie.
Just for the cake.
Will you sit here, please?
- Now, then...
- Mr. and Mrs. Stanley Banks.
24 Maple Drive, Fairview Manor.
- And the wedding is June 10th.
- June 10th. Very good.
- Now, about the reception.
- We're not having a large one, I'm afraid.
Small and sedate. I understand perfectly.
And we don't want a cake.
- What, you don't want a cake?
- No.
- Why?
- I think cakes are cheap.
Every Tom, Dick and Harry has one.
We don't want one.
I understand perfectly.
It's true that very select weddings no longer have them, but for the ordinary run of people we have to show them.
Now, um, about the food, let's see.
What about a large salmon at either end of the table?
With salads in great bowls in the center?
Another very dramatic arrangement is cold sturgeon in the middle of the table.
Now, for the ices, we pride ourselves on a very special effect, with colored lights embedded...
We didn't intend on having that kind of a reception.
What did you have in mind, madam?
Well, we thought we'd have some assorted sandwiches, different kinds, you know.
And some ice cream and little cakes.
Of course you can have just what you wish, madam, but that's what we usually serve for children's parties.
That's what we want.
This 24 Maple Drive.
Is it a club or a country estate?
It's our home.
- What attendance are you anticipating?
- About 250.
- Is it a large house?
- No, it's a small house.
Oh, then, of course, you'll be planning for a marquee on the terrace.
- This, for instance.
- We don't happen to have a terrace.
If they overflow the house, they can tramp around out on the lawn.
I tell you what I'll do.
I'll get one of our field engineers to go over the property.
We always have to do that anyway.
The next Saturday, I finally got around to trying on my old cutaway.
Ellie!
- Ellie!
- Yes, dear?
- Ellie, look, look, look!
- What is it?
- I'm in it.
- Well, well.
Not so bad, huh? A little snug.
Maybe I can... Maybe I could take off a pound or two before the wedding.
Are you standing naturally?
You look as though you might have been strapped up by a surgeon.
I was wondering...
Do you think you ought to get a new one?
- I mean, with Ben getting a new one...
- Oh, nonsense!
What are you talking about?
I've only worn this thing twice.
- Stanley...
- Do you realize that most men couldn't even get into their cutaway after 20 years?
If that button gives way it's going to put out somebody's eye.
You know, sometimes they wear them unbuttoned.
Ah. I kind of like it unbuttoned, don't you?
Like it better that way.
Just wait, just wait.
Wait till I have this thing let out just a little.
You'll be surprised. You wait and see.
Oh, Stanley, I want you to look at these.
Aren't they lovely?
They're Kay's presents to the bridesmaids.
You'd never dream they cost only $15, would you?
- And this is what she's giving Buckley.
She's giving...
She's giving that to Buckley?
The bride always gives the groom a present.
Stanley, that reminds me, can you arrange to meet me in town again on Saturday?
We just have to pick out the flat silver if we're going to get it marked in time.
- The what?
- Kay's flat silver. The table silver.
Now you know perfectly well we give
Kay the flat silver and the linen...
Yes, yes, yes, I know. What does
Buckley's family give, just Buckley?
Just Buckley.
- Mom?
- Yes, dear?
There's a Mr. Massoula and another guy downstairs to see you.
That's the fellow with the cake.
- Say, come here.
- What's wrong?
I just happened to think, you're going to get married pretty soon, aren't you?
And then it'll be my turn, my turn to present you to the father of the bride as my one and only contribution.
- I feel better, son.
- Stanley.
An experienced caterer can make you ashamed of your house in 15 minutes.
Ellie was on the verge of tears.
These doors, they'll have to be taken off and stored.
You'd be surprised how much circulation you lose on account of doors, especially doors like that.
All I know is you can't get more than 125 in the house.
Squash them in like a lot of bugs if you did.
We were planning to take some of this furniture upstairs into the attic.
Yes, we were going to take up the small chairs and the small tables and the standing lamp, and we were even thinking of taking up the rug.
Taking up the rug, lady, ain't going to give us any more room.
- Have you any suggestions?
- Yes, madam, I have.
Even with the marquee out there, you're going to be cramped.
Joe, go out in the back and measure for that marquee.
Right.
You see, madam, circulation is your big problem.
Now, the first thing you've got to do is clear this room of all furniture.
- You mean the settee and the armchairs...
- And the piano.
And in the dining room, the same thing, too.
What do you think I have upstairs, a cold storage warehouse?
I have an attic that's full now.
I suggest you do what our other clients do.
Hire a moving van to take the things out before the reception and bring them back when it's over.
Now, the marquee.
Um, we'll attach the marquee to this French door.
It's stuck. It's stuck.
I'll say it is.
Yes, I've been meaning to get it fixed.
Doesn't matter.
They've got to come off anyway.
It's really quite simple.
All you have to do is push...
Look, you stop! Stop! Just stand still.
I decided after all I might as well get a new cutaway.
Every mail brought a new terror.
- The Cramptons are coming.
- Uh-huh.
The Lewises, the Quincy Browns and the Gaylords.
Apparently Kay picked a day for her wedding when nobody within 400 miles has got anything to do.
- Oh, how nice.
- Somebody refuse?
No, the Whiteheads were asked to another wedding and gave it up to come to ours.
Isn't that sweet?
How nice... The Whiteheads?
They live in Pittsburgh.
What crust, coming all the way from Pittsburgh.
Moms! Pops! Look, I got a present!
A wedding present! Look, a tray.
A lovely hand-painted tray. Delilah!
Delilah, come and see.
Look, I've got a present.
We were not accustomed to such bounty.
The idea anyone should actually go out and purchase a gift with hard money filled us with tender gratitude.
For a few days, it looked as if this might be the last as well as the first, but then they began to come in.
A thin trickle at first, then more and more.
Given enough ointment, there's always a fly.
Given enough presents, there's bound to be a stinker.
- Who sent that?
- "With love from Aunt Hattie."
- Aunt Hattie.
- Kay was expecting a nice, fat check.
When I think of all the guff
I've taken from that old...
- What are we going to do with it?
- Would you really like me to tell you?
You could always drop it.
Oh, Kay! Kay, come take a look at what Aunt Hattie sent you.
- Yeah.
- You can send it back.
Darling, no one would take that back once they got rid of it.
You can send them all back.
The wedding's off.
Kay, what are you saying?
Just that. I'm not going to marry Buckley.
I found out something about him that's unforgivable.
- What could have happened?
- I don't know.
Ellie, let me go to her.
Kitten?
Please, Pops, it's no use talking.
I'm not going to talk, honey.
I just wanted to tell you everything's all right.
Whatever you choose to do, it's okay with us, you know.
Thank you, Pops.
You know, you always used to talk about taking a little trip to Europe.
Why don't I fix that up tomorrow?
You could take one of your friends with you.
Oh, Pops, I couldn't.
Not after all you've been through.
All this horrible expense and everything.
Oh, heavens, that doesn't matter.
Nothing matters, except your happiness.
We can arrange everything.
We'll make some excuse, say that you're ill or something.
We'll send back the presents, notify the people...
Aw, don't.
Oh, he should have told me before.
He shouldn't have kept it from me.
He had this thing come out of the blue.
There, there, there. Don't cry, kitten.
Nova Scotia for our honeymoon.
A camp in Nova Scotia, so he can fish for some horrible salmon or something.
He knew I bought millions of evening clothes and things.
That didn't matter to him. Oh, no.
He loves to go fishing, so he decides we're going fishing.
Well, after all...
What do you mean?
Well, I mean, I thought it was something even worse than that, maybe like another girl or something.
A girl wouldn't be so bad.
At least you can get your teeth in a girl.
But this, this is our whole life.
It's our whole future.
If he's just this selfish now, so mean when it's a question of our honeymoon, what's he gonna be like after we're married?
- Had you talked it over?
- Of course we had.
I told him I wanted to go someplace romantic, but he said there was nothing as romantic as a fishing shack in Nova Scotia.
We had a horrible fight.
I said terrible things to him.
And he called me a spoiled brat.
I made him stop the car, and I jumped out and left him right there.
Buckley's here.
The poor boy's stricken.
He looks terrible.
- Will you see him?
- No.
I never saw anyone who was suffering so.
He'll get over it.
- Good evening, sir.
- Won't see you, Buckley.
- If I could speak to her...
- It's no use, son.
Will you tell her that I'm sorry, that she's right about the whole thing?
I was selfish and pigheaded.
I didn't realize. I should have asked her.
I'll go anywhere, I'll do anything.
Just tell her that I'm sorry.
I'd give anything to take back what I said. Will you tell her?
Yes, I'll tell her. I'll tell her. Yes.
Go on home, now. Pull yourself together.
- What'd you do to your hand?
- Nothing!
Kay slammed the car door on it.
- Buckley!
- Let's get some...
- Buckley! Darling! Oh, darling!
- Darling!
- Oh, darling, I'm sorry.
- No, it was my fault.
- No, it wasn't.
- Forgive me. No, it was mine.
It wasn't your fault, it was mine.
I was selfish and pigheaded. I was stupid.
- I did act like a spoiled brat.
- I'll go anywhere you want to go.
Darling, does it hurt? I'm sorry.
It doesn't matter, just as long as we're together.
Anywhere you want to go.
I'm sorry, darling. It was all my fault.
I'll never do that again,
I promise you I won't.
It's all right.
By the time we got to the wedding rehearsal, everyone but me seemed to have lost interest.
And to make it even worse, it was raining cats and dogs.
Now, you have to take the bride's party.
You're the only one who knows the Banks family and where to put them.
Now, the usher for the groom is Edward Owen. Edward Owen.
He couldn't come tonight, Mr. Banks, but I'll see him tomorrow.
- Oh, he couldn't come tonight, huh?
- No, sir.
Great.
Now, boys and girls, listen.
Now I'm sure that you want this to come off perfect in every detail...
God bless you. Just as I do.
So, what we're going to do is just stick here tonight until we get it right, even if it takes all night.
Kay, it's about time.
- I'm sorry.
- Where's Buckley?
I just got through talking to him on the phone.
He said he'd try to be here as soon as he could.
- He'd try to be here?
- What do you say we start rehearsing?
- Good evening.
- The bridegroom isn't here.
Half of the wedding party isn't here.
Half of the wedding party never is here.
It's quite all right.
We can't very well go on without the minister.
It doesn't matter. I take the rehearsal.
Everything will be all right.
Just don't worry.
Now come on, boys and girls, take your places.
Shouldn't you be up front?
Why don't you go?
Come on, let's get going.
Pops, the bride never rehearses.
It's bad luck.
Ben, there's no reason why you shouldn't rehearse.
Come on, get up front.
- Who's this?
- He belongs up at the altar here.
Yes, of course. Up at the altar.
Get back there. Two girls in front.
You go over here, and you there.
There, that's right.
Now then, now we want a bride.
You'll do for the bride.
You come over here, take Mr. Banks' arm like that.
- We won't need that.
- It'll be fine tomorrow, I'm sure.
Go right back, please, Mr. Banks.
There we are.
- Excuse me. Sorry.
- There, that's fine.
All right, then.
Now then, as for the simple step.
The simple step you have to do is perfectly easy.
You'll all get the hang of it.
Just watch me.
Girls, watch me very carefully.
Step, stop, and step, stop.
Step, stop, and... See, that's all it is.
That's all there is to it.
This is perfectly easy, isn't it?
Now then, boys, when I give you the word "go", start off with the right foot.
All right, Fritz. Fritz!
Now then, right... Don't hesitate.
Just an ordinary walk, just a dignified walk.
Come on, get a move on. Little faster.
That's right. Come on, come on.
Another boy with you there.
Come on, girls.
When I tell you to go.
Listen to the music.
Now... Wait, wait. Right foot.
Are you by yourself? Come on, here.
Come on, get a move on. Go.
- It's all going too fast.
- Now the bride and the father.
Now, the right foot, Mr. Banks.
The right foot. Here we go.
- Never mind that. Right foot.
- All right, all right.
The right foot first, please.
It's quite simple, it is really simple, Mr. Banks.
Good heavens! What's going on up there?
What are you doing here?
- I'm the best man.
- The best man has got to be by the altar.
Now, then, boys and girls, each side of the aisle.
No, boys over there.
Bridesmaids, that's right.
Come on, over here. The boys on the right.
There you are. That's right.
You really must practice at home, Mr. Banks.
Come on, there we are. That's right.
You stay there.
Now, then. So, so, so-so-so, so-so.
Then after "Who giveth?" "I do."
Then you go back and join Mrs. Banks.
No, you back gracefully.
Doesn't matter which foot first.
Then you slide in. That's right.
When the ceremony's over, the bridegroom takes the bride down the aisle.
- I'll be the bridegroom.
- Where are you going?
Then you take the lady of honor...
She's gone now.
She'll be here tomorrow.
Each bridesmaid takes an usher, and away you go.
That's right. That's right.
You got it? Yes, you've got it. Splendid.
Yes, you be here tomorrow.
Now, let's get down to brass tacks and have a real good rehearsal.
- But I thought it was fine.
- Fine? That was a rat race.
Well, you should've...
All through, I see.
That means that I'm just in time, eh?
I'm so sorry, I had a meeting.
Tringle here is an old hand.
- They all know their stuff, Tringle?
- Oh, good, good.
I'm sure everything will go smoothly and be a beautiful wedding.
Now, if you'll forgive me,
I have a meeting.
Just a moment, Reverend Galsworthy.
We haven't had a rehearsal.
The groom isn't here.
Oh, the groom isn't very important, is he, my dear?
You're not nervous, are you, my dear?
She's not nervous.
Have your young man call me in the morning.
I'll put him through his paces.
Now, I must run.
I hate to, but I must.
Don't worry, because everything will go beautifully tomorrow.
I know. I've done it before.
Good luck, my dear.
Such a beautiful bride.
I'm sure you'll be very happy. Goodbye.
Chaos.
Don't worry, darling.
You'll have Kay with you.
She's been a bridesmaid so many times she could walk up the aisle blindfolded.
Absolute complete chaos.
When I finally got to sleep that night,
I dreamed of the wedding.
I was late.
Somehow I couldn't seem to move my feet.
Hi, Pops.
What are you doing here?
I couldn't sleep. What are you doing?
I was hungry.
Pops, I know I'm a fool, but if I tell you something, you won't think I'm silly, will you?
Of course not, kitten.
What's bothering you?
I'm scared, Pops. Scared to death.
Why, what are you scared of?
There's nothing to be scared of.
- Marriage is the most normal thing...
- Oh, I know, Pops.
I'm not scared of marriage.
It's much sillier than that.
See, it's this way.
You know how I wanted a simple wedding, out in the country somewhere.
Well, that's out.
We don't live in the country, period.
But this thing's gotten bigger and bigger and bigger.
I know it's ungrateful of me.
Sometimes it scares the living daylights out of me.
You mean, walking down the aisle, huh?
Yeah. Every time I think about it,
I break into a cold sweat.
Suppose my knees got shaking just as I started.
Suppose they shook till finally they let me down entirely, you had to drag me down the aisle like a sack of meal.
We could always take a short snort just before the show begins.
Oh, Pops.
Now, look, kitten.
Get this into your head.
There is nothing to worry about.
Not a thing.
Whenever you've been bothered,
I've always been around, haven't I?
I'll be around when that Wedding March starts, too.
All you have to do is take my arm and lean against me and relax.
I'll do the rest.
Oh, you are wonderful.
Nothing ever fazes you, does it?
The day of the wedding dawned at last.
Haven't you got this stuff out of here yet?
I'm sorry. I didn't know you were in a hurry. We were just relaxing.
The quicker you get it out the better off we'll all be.
No flowers! Take them out of here!
Hold it, hold it! Hello?
Hello, Aunt Hattie!
Well, Aunt Hattie.
Yes, this is the day, Aunt Hattie.
Sorry you couldn't make it.
What? Oh, you're here.
- Well, yeah. Just a minute.
- From Aunt Hattie.
Where are you, Aunt Hattie?
Where? At the depot?
Oh, Ben! Ben, Ben. Thank you.
Aunt Hattie's down at the depot.
Take the car and go down and get her.
Oh, I can't, Pop. I gotta collect
Buckley's things and bring them here.
I thought it was understood that your domestic staff is to stay out of the kitchen.
My domestic staff is getting me a bicarbonate of soda.
Make your choice.
Wedding banquet or bicarbonate of soda, you can't have both.
Aunt Hattie. Hello? Hello, Aunt Hattie.
Ah, ah, ah, ah.
- If you'll just wait outside the station...
- Mr. Banks, where's Kay?
- I've got to see her right away.
- Upstairs, upstairs.
Somebody will pick you up. Yes. Yes.
Tommy! Aunt Hattie is down at the station.
Forget it, Pop. I can't.
I gotta borrow a white shirt.
Hello, Joe.
- What are you trying to do, trip me up?
- I'm sorry, sorry.
Joe? Joe? Take the pipe lane, turn off at Durand.
- Yeah. Follow Durand for two miles...
- Why don't you look where you're going?
Do you want this stuff moved out or don't you?
- Yeah, of course, I do.
- Then tell this guy to keep his pots...
Ask at the gas station!
I'll tell you what you can do...
- We've been here...
- Why don't you wait with your pots?
And let all these ferns and things wilt out there in that sun?
You know how much these things cost?
You're not buying this stuff, Mac, you're just renting it.
How do you like the nerve of this guy?
There's your boss! He's my boss, too!
Gangway...
Gangway!
By 3:00, I was dressed.
I took the precaution of wearing a belt and suspenders.
Ellie.
Ellie, do you know what time it is?
Quarter past 4:00.
We should be there right now. Hurry up.
Where's this automobile?
Well, I'll be a...
Hello? Hello?
Operator, will you get me
Jake's Garage, please?
Well, keep on trying, will you? Please?
We've got a wedding and no way to get to the church. No cars.
- Will you do that? Thanks very much.
- Don't worry, darling.
There's one thing we know, they can't start without us.
I knew I'd never be able to remember what Ellie wore that day.
But I also knew I'd never forget the way she looked with all the beauty of her own wedding day on her.
Ellie.
- Ellie, you look...
- Thank you, darling.
You don't have to say another word.
You have no right to look like this.
It isn't fair to the bride.
Hello? Hello? Is this Jake's Garage?
What? Holy smoke,
Aunt Hattie, where are you?
They're here, the cars are here.
Never mind.
- Kay, Delilah, the cars are here.
- Just a minute.
It's Aunt Hattie. She's been at the station all morning, wants to know how to get to the church.
We'll take the first car.
You follow with Kay.
Ellie, Ellie! What am I gonna tell her?
This is your relative.
Tell her to jump in a lake.
Aunt Hattie, go outside the station, there's a lake...
There's some taxis out there. Take one, go to the church. I'll pay for it later.
All right, Aunt Hattie. All right.
Kay! Kay, you know what time it is?
- Kay, Kay, Kay, it's 4:20.
- I'm ready. Come in.
She looked like the princess in a fairy tale.
I wouldn't have been surprised if she'd held out her hand for me to kiss.
You're wonderful, kitten. Just wonderful.
Thanks, Pops.
- Well, on to the slaughter.
- Yeah. This is it, isn't it?
- All right. Take this, your bouquet.
- Thanks, Pops.
Thanks. Thanks. Goodbye.
- Hello, I'm Duffy, the candid cameraman.
- You just store that thing.
Here they are.
Kay! She's beautiful!
Ushers, come on. All the ushers.
Quickly, come.
Remember, right foot forward. Go.
Bridesmaids, come on. Take your place.
Now, Mr. Banks, this is the Wedding March.
Get ready.
Right, stop. Left, stop.
Well, Pops, we're off.
Get ready.
Remember, the right foot forward.
Right foot. Right.
Right. Right.
Right.
Hold it, Pops.
Kay overwhelmed me.
She waited for the proper moment with the calmness of a general watching his forces deploy into battle.
Buckley, on the other hand, had the haggard look of a man who had just completed a dangerous bombing mission.
Ready?
Dearly beloved, we are gathered together here in the sight of God and in the face of this company to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony, which is an honorable estate, instituted of God, signifying unto us the mystical union that is betwixt Christ and his church.
All I could think of was the part I had to play.
I knew I had a cue coming.
When the Reverend Galsworthy got to the place where he asked,
"Who giveth this woman?"
I had to say "I do."
It was my only line in the show and I wanted to get it right.
Then I was supposed to drop back a step, turn, and join Ellie in the front pew.
I couldn't remember what was immediately in my rear.
I began to explore.
I didn't want to trip or fall.
People are so quick to attribute such things to alcohol.
While I was still exploring, it was on me.
Who giveth this woman to be married to this man?
I do.
"Who giveth this woman?"
"This woman?"
But she's not a woman, she's still a child, and she's leaving us.
What's it going to be like to come home and not find her?
Not to hear her voice calling,
"Hi, Pops" as I come in.
I suddenly realized what I was doing.
I was giving up Kay.
Something inside me began to hurt.
I, Buckley Dunstan...
I, Buckley Dunstan...
- ...take thee, Katherine Banks...
- ...take thee, Katherine Banks...
- ...to my wedded wife.
- ...to my wedded wife.
- To have and to hold...
- To have and to hold...
- ...from this day forward.
- ...from this day forward.
- With this ring I thee wed.
- With this ring I thee wed.
- In the name of the Father...
- In the name of the Father...
- ...and of the Son...
- ...and of the Son...
- ...and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.
- ...and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.
For as much as Buckley Dunstan and Katherine Banks have consented together in holy wedlock,
I pronounce that they are man and wife in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.
God the Father, God the Son,
God the Holy Ghost bless and preserve and keep you.
The Lord mercifully with his favor look upon you and fill you with all spiritual benediction and grace that ye may so live together in this life that in the world to come ye may have life everlasting.
Amen.
Now the race was on, to get back to the house and the free champagne.
The house was bursting at the seams.
Everywhere I looked there were faces, most of them I'd never seen before.
I wondered if someone had broadcast a general invitation by radio.
The temperature under the marquee was midway between a Turkish bath and a greenhouse.
No one was listening to the orchestra.
Ellie could have saved that 85 bucks.
The caterer was having his trouble, too.
Something was wrong, very wrong, with his circulation.
Yes. Yes. Ladies and gentlemen,
I must insist that you pass through the door into the parkway. Please.
But there was nothing wrong with the waiters.
The moment a person tilted a glass, they were waiting at his elbow with a fresh supply.
Never have I seen men more devoted to their work.
I was looking for Kay.
I still hadn't kissed the bride.
Well, you know, Miss Cale's daughter moved into the palace...
Where's Kay? I can't find her.
Oh, they're in the garden, having their pictures taken.
Stanley, first will you see about the champagne? I'm worried.
Yeah, the way they're handing it out, you'd think they were working on the piece basis.
- See about it, will you?
- All right. All right.
How's the champagne holding up?
Okay, okay, mister, don't worry.
You'll get yours.
Edith! Edith! Hurry up!
Kay's going to throw the bouquet.
Kay! Pardon, miss. Kay!
I want to see this.
- Where's Pops? I don't see him.
- I haven't seen him either.
Pardon me. I'm sorry.
Stanley, where on earth have you been?
Kay just threw her bouquet.
Ellie, look, look, please be nice to me.
For once in your life be nice to me...
No, you can't go up now.
She's changing her clothes.
The reception had turned into a party.
I was skulking around the edges, still waiting for a chance to see Kay.
They're going! They're going!
Come and get your confetti.
Get out of my way, Pop!
Get your confetti.
All of you, get your confetti.
Get it while it lasts. It's going fast.
She was gone. My Kay was gone.
And I'd been too late to say goodbye to her.
When the last guest had gone, and the last glass of champagne had been drunk, we surveyed the wreckage.
I suppose we better clean up and not leave this mess for Delilah tomorrow.
I'll go up and change my dress.
Would you get the vacuum, darling?
Hmm. Oh.
Funny how empty a house can suddenly get, isn't it?
Oh, I'm sorry you missed saying goodbye to her.
It's all right.
I think she's going to be happy with him.
That's the important thing, isn't it?
Oh, sure, sure, sure.
Ellie, look.
Hello?
Hello, kitten!
Where are you?
New York. Our train's leaving in a second, but I just couldn't leave without saying goodbye to you.
I'm coming.
Pops, say goodbye again to Moms, and thank her for all she did.
And, Pops, you've been just wonderful.
I love you.
I love you very much.
Goodbye, kitten.
Catch a lot of fish.
Bye-bye.
All right now?
Nothing's really changed, has it?
You know what they say.
My son's my son until he gets him a wife, but my daughter's my daughter all of her life.
All of our life.
- Congratulations.
- We're so pleased.
A wonderful article in the paper about you,
Sir Oliver. It's wonderful, sir! Wonderful!
Good morning, Professor, or I should say Sir Oliver.
- Long article about you.
- Is there? Well, well, well.
I think they made a mistake about your age.
Paper! Paper!
Paper! Paper!
Paper!
It's such an honor for Edinburgh, Sir Oliver.
I cannot take your money.
- Thank you.
- Paper! Paper!
Congratulations, Professor.
# Here's to the prof of geology
# Master of all natural history
# Rare boy he, and rare boys we
# To know such a big curiosity
# To the braw, aye, aye, aye, aye
# To the bricht, aye, aye, aye, aye
# To the knicht, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye
# Aye
I'm sorry.
Sir Oliver, since you have been created a knight,
I've given your students a holiday - a day for a knight, so to speak.
First, however, there's to be a presentation.
Will the Laird of Glendarach step forward?
Sir Oliver.
In the name of the student body, in gratitude for the knowledge you have imparted to us...
That's enough obituary prose.
An inkwell, I presume.
A very handsome thing.
Hellish to dust.
I thank you all from the bottom of my heart.
And now off to the playing fields, all of you!
Ah.
It cost £4.17. I was on the committee that made the collection.
- I thank you for your efforts, McEwen.
- £5 was subscribed. That left three shillings.
You're not going to give me the change, are you?
I expended it on this. A little extra token
I thought you might fancy.
I saw it during Easter week in a little window in Glasgow, a curiosity shop.
It seemed to whisper to me.
"Buy me for Professor Lindenbrook."
What did you reply?
I said "Only if you can be bought for three shillings."
- I argued with the owner all Good Friday.
- It's lava, of course.
But exceptionally heavy.
Could serve as a paperweight.
- Do you like it, Professor?
- It's a scholar's choice.
What are you eating tonight?
This being Tuesday, I'm not eating.
I find it very healthy to eat only every other night.
Be at my house at eight o'clock.
I'm entertaining some of the faculty.
- I do not think I could.
- What's the matter with you?
You used to come to my house regularly.
Is it those frayed cuffs that worry you?
I won't get my other shirt from the wash till Friday.
Eight o'clock sharp.
We're scientists, aren't we?
That's one society where frayed cuffs don't matter. We've all had 'em.
Yes, Sir Oliver. Eight o'clock.
Lava.
I swear there's something inside.
- There's Uncle now, Kirsty.
- And high time too!
I thought it was Uncle Oliver.
I want it understood that not a single stitch
I'm wearing belongs to me.
- Good evening, Miss Jenny.
- Good evening, Alec McEwen.
- I'm early, but I trust I'm not too early.
- I didn't know you were coming.
Well, your uncle - I should say Sir Oliver - ordered me to come.
Where is he? He's never been late like this - never.
I don't know, but, to return to the subject of my clothes, they're my classmate's, the young Laird of Glendarach.
"You can't go to dinner dressed like that" said the young laird.
"The professor knows my wardrobe"
I replied, and went to take my bath.
When I returned, my clothes had been confiscated and these substituted.
I want to make it clear I have no claim to the Glendarach tartan.
You've explained your magnificence.
Kirsty!
There will be one more guest.
- I'll seat you between the dean and the rector.
- Couldn't I sit next to you?
Certainly not.
Pardon my being personal, but I notice a certain harshness in your attitude toward me.
What do you expect when it takes a command from my uncle to bring you to this house?
Miss Jenny, why should I torture myself to no purpose?
Two years more I have to study for my master's degree.
Then four years more as a laboratory assistant.
There's the money I owe my relatives.
They're paying for my schooling.
You are very logical, Mr McEwen.
- It's the logic of an empty purse.
- How like a Scotsman.
I am a Scotsman.
I know one whose purse was not empty, because he didn't even have a purse.
His name was Robert Burns.
Do you know what he said?
Miss Jenny, the time of poetry is over.
If this is true, Alec McEwen, what are you doing with your hand on my knee?
Miss Jenny.
Now you just wait in there.
Kirsty, I'll set the extra place.
Is there something you want?
- A key is stuck.
- But that's impossible.
It was just tuned last month.
Which one?
- This one. Can't you see?
- No, I can't.
At least you can see how unhappy I am.
You know how I've felt since that day you entered the classroom and brought your uncle the galoshes he forgot.
You looked like spring itself.
# My love is like a red, red rose
# That's newly sprung in June
# My love is like the melody
# That's sweetly played in tune
I thought you were setting the table.
There's a key stuck. Mr McEwen is fixing it.
#... my bonny lass
# So deep in love am I
# That I will love you still, my dear
# Till all the seas go dry
# Till all the seas go dry, my love
# And rocks melt with the sun
# And I will love you still, my dear
# While the sands of life shall run
# So fare-thee-well, my only love
# And fare-thee-well a while
# For I'll come back to you, my love
# Though it were ten thousand mile
- Miss Jenny, you're crying.
- I've been over the goose... the fumes...
- Good evening, Miss Jenny.
- Good evening, gentlemen.
We were worrying about Professor Lindenbrook.
Yes, we were. Isn't he with you?
- Isn't he here?
- No.
- Careful it doesn't go too high, Paisley.
- It's just about the limit now, Sir Oliver.
I gave no permission for visitors.
Oh, it's you, McEwen.
- Good lad. You can lend Paisley a hand.
- Uncle, your guests are waiting.
If you don't come now, the goose will be...
- Oh, goose, goose, goose!
- Tell him, Alec.
This lava you gave me is one in ten million.
I've been at it all day.
- Aye, and without a pause for lunch or tea.
- You've had three semesters of petrology.
Now then, from which volcano could this piece of lava have emerged?
- Fujiyama?
- No.
- Mount Etna?
- Very close. The Mediterranean.
The Lipari island group off the coast of Italy.
- But theirs is a very light lava, sir.
- That's exactly what stumped me.
Inside there must be something the weight of the heaviest rock in existence.
- But that would be Icelandic peridotite.
- Precisely.
- There's a piece chipped off.
- By me.
- What's the rock inside?
- Icelandic peridotite, naturally.
When I saw this, I stopped chipping.
There's some marks on the surface.
Looks like a letter or some notches.
Three notches made by the hand of man.
But how could a rock from Iceland possibly pop out of a volcano across the world? What's your conclusion?
Science does notjump to conclusions.
Science is not a guessing game.
We're going to melt off the crust of lava.
Mr Paisley.
Add 10cc of aqua regia.
Not too fast, you know.
I shall write to Professor Goetaborg of Stockholm about this.
He's the leading authority on volcanoes.
How long is all this going to take?
A typically female question. To melt lava will take as long as it takes lava to melt.
- Maybe two hours, maybe four hours.
- Two hours? Four hours?
Maybe the whole night.
Who cares?
Jenny!
Are you all right?
That was entirely my fault, Sir Oliver.
I don't know how it could have happened.
Mr Paisley, by your slip you've rendered an inestimable service to science.
Alec.
See this? What would you call it?
As you said, it's a man-made object.
Looks like a top.
A surveyor's instrument. A plumb bob.
Not only looks like - it is a plumb bob.
- There are letters on it.
- It's an inscription. A message, perhaps.
Can you make out what it says, Professor?
It's in some Nordic tongue.
The hand that wrote this trembled.
Perhaps it was a dying hand.
I wonder what it's written in. Paint? Ink?
- Perhaps blood.
- Possibly.
Look at this side, sir. A signature.
Arne Saknus...
Arne Saknussem.
I hope it isn't too much to suggest that you take me home now, Uncle Oliver.
Or do I have to go alone?
Alone. Alone. It's unthinkable, but it must be true.
A man took some tools and went where no human being has ever set foot.
Alone. Into the interior of the earth, alone.
- What is he talking about?
- Arne Saknussem, the Icelandic scientist.
Greatest of his day. He was laughed at when he claimed there was a world down below.
The laughter stopped when he disappeared, never to be heard from.
Until tonight.
Get out of here, woman! I didn't ask for tea.
I don't want any tea! All I want is my post.
There's no use shouting at me, Sir Oliver.
I can shoutjust as loud as you can!
For two weeks you've had nothing to eat and you haven't slept!
Out, woman!
Here's your post, Uncle Oliver.
Another day and still nothing.
Can you believe that? No answer!
- Where is Alec McEwen?
- At the university, looking for letters there.
How long does it take for a letter to get here from Stockholm?
- Answer the bell.
- Did it ring?
We have to speak to Sir Oliver.
And don't tell us he's busy.
Callers, callers. That's all I need.
Oliver, we all know your reputation for rudeness.
You also have a reputation as a conscientious man.
But you've skipped every lecture in two weeks.
- I'm involved in something important.
- More important than our university?
Something any university would envy us.
You laugh. What does the name
Arne Saknussem mean to you, gentlemen?
Saknussem... Just a second.
Wasn't he the one who wrote about the lost city of Atlantis?
That was an early phase of his career.
His real fame rests on his study of volcanoes.
Out of a volcano came this message from him.
It lay unnoticed for 100 years, was probably picked up by some peasant, gathered dust in a curiosity shop till it came to me.
Here is a translation of the words.
"I am dying, but my life's work must not be lost."
"Whoever descends into the crater of Sneffels Yocul can reach the center of the earth.
I did it. Arne Saknussem."
- The center of the earth?
- Sneffels Yocul?
An extinct volcano in Iceland.
There must be a direct route from it to a region no man has ever seen.
But, Oliver, this is sheer fantasy.
You haven't heard all of it.
There's a postscript.
"At sunrise on the last day of May the mountain Scartaris will point the path."
- Well, what do you say now?
- I'm more mystified than ever.
- Scartaris?
- It's a mountain peak near the volcano.
But this is a student's hoax.
You should know better.
Just a second, Rector.
Let's not take that tone.
Let's assume it's authentic.
Isn't the correct procedure to write a paper and submit it to the university officially?
More than anything, you must consult other experts.
- A thing like this needs verification.
- Here is my paper.
And I've written to the foremost authority in Europe.
The Royal Geological Society?
More eminent still.
Professor Goetaborg of Stockholm.
And what does he say?
Unfortunately I've not yet received his reply.
And I've written to him twice.
I suggest we relax on the matter until your famous correspondent sees fit to answer you.
And in the meantime we could do with a cup of tea.
I know you two think I'm daft.
Think whatever you want!
Jenny, tea!
- When did you get here?
- Just this moment, Sir Oliver. Look.
It's from Stockholm!
Well, he's got his letter from Stockholm.
Did you see the shine in his eyes?
There'll never be a better moment to tell him about our feelings for each other.
- He'll say yes almost inadvertently.
- What if he says no advertently?
You wait and see how firm my voice can be when I speak of you.
Blast and damn!
Blast and damnation!
- The devil blast it!
- What is it, Oliver?
- Don't keep us in the dark.
- Bad news, sir?
I am stricken. The University of Stockholm informs me that Professor Goetaborg has vanished from Sweden.
His disappearance follows closely the date my communication must have reached him.
With all my material.
He evidently didn't think it important enough to answer.
Or too important.
McEwen, go directly to the harbor. Find out when the next ship leaves for Iceland.
- Oliver, calm down.
- I will not be beaten to my goal.
- But what is your goal?
- You heard Saknussem's message.
- Oliver, you're seriously ill.
- I am seriously well.
What are you waiting for? I told you to hurry.
If you'll excuse me, I must start packing.
- To go where?
- To Iceland to begin with.
- And then?
- Where Arne Saknussem went.
- Oliver!
- Will you kindly stop saying Oliver.
I can't sit in my classrooms waiting, while a scoundrel named Goetaborg exploits what I foolishly placed in his hands.
Don't you see what's at stake? The ultimate aim of all science: To penetrate the unknown.
Do you realize we know less about the earth we live on than about the stars and the galaxies of outer space?
The greatest mystery is right here, right under our feet.
And now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen...
- I must have a word with you.
- I've no time.
- You must take time for this, sir.
- What are you so urgent about?
- This is the most urgent moment of my life.
- Not for me. I have to be in Iceland.
So must I. I'm going with you, sir.
- Where?
- To the center of the earth, naturally.
# My heart's in the Highlands
# A-chasing the deer
# A-hunting the wild deer
# And chasing the roe
# My heart's in the Highlands
# Wherever I go
Right now all Iceland must be aware that the Scots have arrived.
I wish I could sing loud enough for Jenny to hear me.
Homesick already?
It is a bit painful to leave her on the first day of our engagement.
To come back to her as a world-famous scientist is not to be sneezed at.
Come here. Take a look.
Did you expect a flight of stairs with a red carpet?
I neglected to tell you, sir.
I have a nervous fear of heights.
Well, you'll get over that after the first million fathoms or so.
Million fathoms...
Alec, he's been here.
He's been surveying here.
This is fresh-cut wood.
- Your revered colleague from Stockholm.
- He isn't wasting any time.
- Do you think he's already gone down?
- No. The message said the last day of May.
Take our carriage to Reykjavik.
Buy all the rope available.
Stock up on hardtacks, salted beef, chocolate, and all the medical supplies we need, but more than anything inquire whether they have Ruhmkorff lamps.
Have another carriage waiting for me at sunset.
- You think we can prepare it all so quickly?
- We must. We're in a race.
What's that you're taking?
Jenny's farewell gift.
I'll keep it with me always.
Scartaris.
- Back to my hotel.
- Já, Professor Goetaborg.
My good man.
I assume my assistant sent you.
No, no, thank you.
Nobody carries a soldier's weapons.
And take your time.
These instruments are delicate.
Easy, coachman.
This isn't the same road we came by this morning. I said slow down, man!
You're out of your senses! Stop your horses, man! This is not a request, it's a command!
Can't you hear me? Slow down!
Stop, you fool!
Whoa!
If you've ruined my instruments,
I'll horsewhip you, so help me.
And where are we?
This certainly is not my hotel.
- Professor!
- Alec!
Where are we?
Apparently in an eider-feather storehouse.
- How did you get here?
- I don't know. It went so fast.
I was clubbed. I was overpowered before I knew there was a struggle.
- Did you see who did it?
- No. I was just trying to do your errands.
I said Professor Goetaborg was a scoundrel.
He's a criminal.
Very likely he's dreamed of such a project.
Your letter was the key to the door of fame.
- Hush. Did you hear that?
- What?
Some tapping.
Don't get your hopes up, Professor.
There's not a soul around.
- Everybody is in the market square.
- Why? It isn't Sunday.
The fishing fleet is going out for the first summer haul.
- You mean the shops are closed?
- No, the shops are open.
But every piece of rope, every lamp, everything we'd need was sold.
To Professor Goetaborg.
He's staying in the very inn where we have our rooms.
This time I heard it too.
- A fellow prisoner, do you suppose?
- Let's give it a signal, sir.
- It's a code.
- Morse?
I can'tjust make it out. Jot this down.
Dash, dash, dot, dot, dot, dot, long dash...
- It doesn't make sense.
- Perhaps it's in Icelandic.
I don't think so.
We've established contact.
I still can't make it out.
My esteemed friend, whoever you are, let me introduce myself.
Professor Oliver Lindenbrook,
University of Edinburgh.
May I ask you to interrupt your tapping for a moment and listen?
In what language would you like me to speak?
- He doesn't understand English.
- I'll try French.
Mon cher ami, vous et nous sommes dans une situation abominable.
It's no good, sir. It sounds more Russian.
Gertrude?
Gertrude! Gertrude!
- It's a female prisoner.
- And her lover.
Professor, they're kissing.
I'm sorry, but for once we must dispense with tact.
Much as I regret to disturb this tender moment, is there any way you can get us out of here?
It's a duck!
And I was just about to try Latin!
Young man with the gold tooth, I'll give you more gold if you'll guide us to Reykjavik.
You take us to Reykjavik.
I understand that Professor Goetaborg from Stockholm is stopping here, a friend of mine.
- A friend of yours? Professor Goetaborg?
- Let's say a colleague.
May I have your help?
- He is at home, isn't he?
- Yes, I...
He is not at home. He is not to be disturbed.
- Don't tell me he's asleep with this going on.
- You cannot see him. I'm sorry.
Here are your coins. And here is my card, if you'll be good enough to put it in his box so that he'll know tomorrow that I'm around.
Thank you so much.
Goetaborg! I know you're in there.
Open up. This is Lindenbrook.
Goetaborg.
Do you see what this is, laddie?
The very last word in equipment.
Ruhmkorff lamps.
Self-generating.
- How long will they burn?
- My guess is indefinitely.
As long as they're wound up, the induction coil will give off current.
Breathing devices.
The kind they use in coal mines in Wales.
All the instruments needed for exploring the world below, whatever it may be.
I shall wait here till Goetaborg returns.
You wait too.
Goetaborg may be a strong man.
More treasure, sir. Climbing boots.
Alpenstocks.
Blankets.
Food for months.
A chart of the...
Professor!
What?
Well, Goetaborg, it seems there's such a thing as justice after all.
So you wanted to push in ahead of us.
Fate took care of him.
Why didn't they tell us at the desk?
Hotels rarely advertise the fact that there are corpses lying around.
The Icelander teaches us a lesson.
All right. We'll observe one minute of silence in memory of a great scientist, even if he was a blasted thief.
Alec, you mentioned fate. Slight correction.
Fate plus a few grains of potassium cyanide.
He was against someone who was even more against him.
Who?
I'm the wife of Professor Goetaborg.
- Oh, my dear.
- What is it?
I was surprised my husband wasn't at the pier to meet me. Is something wrong?
Won't you sit down for a minute before you go up?
Please, my dear.
He seemed so well. Early in the morning he went to the mountain.
When he came back for lunch he received his guest right in the lobby. I saw him myself.
They went up to his room and ate.
What are you trying to tell me?
That my husband is?
His guest left about four.
In the evening when the maid went to make the bed...
Oh, dear God! As long as I can remember, no one ever died in my inn!
Of course, we called a doctor, but it was too late.
We left him up there because we knew you were due in on the morning boat.
Just ten days ago he was... he was joking on the pier in Stockholm.
The moment he arrived here he sent me a message, just with one word: "Come."
Madam, my deep sympathy.
My name - Oliver Lindenbrook of Edinburgh University.
I take it you're familiar with that name.
- Professor Lindenbrook.
- I see you are.
I must ask you a question, and it's just as well that Madam Goetaborg be present.
This will be difficult for you, madam, but it must be faced.
Who was the last person to see him alive?
His luncheon guest.
- And who was that?
- Count Saknussem.
Count Saknussem? I didn't realize the Saknussem family still existed.
The Saknussems are the oldest family in this whole land.
A descendant of Arne Saknussem?
And a scientist too in his own right.
And it was he who lunched with Professor Goetaborg?
They saw each other every day.
They worked together in his room with all those charts and instruments.
I suggest that you have an autopsy performed immediately.
You think there's something suspicious about my husband's death?
Your husband came to Iceland for the same reasons that brought me.
Neither he nor I could suspect there was a third party who would stop at nothing to forestall us.
He was... killed?
Poisoned.
This is now a matter for the police.
Go and send for them at once.
To your room first, madam.
Just one second, if you please. Thank you.
I am deeply distressed by your husband's death, and I fully understand your feelings.
However, I must ask you one question.
How do you plan to dispose of the equipment your husband assembled up there?
- What does it matter now?
- Don't give it another thought.
- I'll take it off your hands.
- We can discuss it later.
No, we cannot discuss it later, madam.
Time is running out.
My expedition must start within the next 24 hours.
- Your expedition?
- Exactly.
I only know of the Goetaborg Expedition.
Husbands don't tell their wives everything.
I do not wish to blacken the memory of your husband, but as I'm under pressure,
I must change my request to a demand.
I have a right to that equipment and I claim it.
A right? To take over the work of another man's lifetime?
- He died for that idea.
- An idea he stole from me.
- That is a lie.
- Madam...
An unforgivable lie!
I would rather destroy every pound of that equipment than let you have it.
"Incredible encounter."
"A Saknussem descendant turns up - acts as if he were King of Volcanoes."
"Tries to force me to surrender his ancestor's secret."
"Saknussem called again."
"New complication.
My real adversary arrives: Lindenbrook."
"Undoubtedly to claim his rights.
Must fight him somehow."
Young man, would you come here a moment, please?
Who are those for?
Professor Lindenbrook.
- Oh. At least we have some rope.
- That's a beginning.
Tell him to stop jabbering and go for some more shopping.
What about lamps?
Lamps. Lamps.
What about picks?
And provisions. Food.
What are you doing? What are you doing?
Put me down! Put me down!
Kindly put me down! Put me down!
Will somebody please explain this outrage?
Are we to be abducted every day in Iceland?
- She speaks Icelandic.
- I do.
But I wish to apologize to you in plain English.
I went through my husband's diary, and some of his remarks led me to believe I did you an injustice.
- I'm sorry. I didn't know.
- Don't give it another thought. I shan't.
I'm Sir Oliver's assistant, Alec McEwen.
This whole expedition began, thanks to this lad.
Began - and that's all it has done.
Sir Oliver, this morning you asked me for these.
If you still want them, they're yours.
Will you say that again?
I shall not stand in the way of the Lindenbrook Expedition.
Madam.
My husband had these boots made specially. I hope they fit you.
Mine will be ready without delay. I told your man to order some for me immediately.
Good, good.
What was that?
Why would you need boots like this?
Well, I can't very well go in these.
- Go where, madam?
- Don't say it.
Naturally, I'm coming along.
That's why I'm giving you all of this.
- It's a condition. I thought you understood.
- You didn't mention any condition.
Then I do now. Whom did you intend to take along, besides this young man?
- The big Icelander.
- Then I'll be very useful.
- He doesn't understand a word of English.
- You can't come along! You're a woman!
And what has my sex to do with it?
We're not contemplating a stroll down Piccadilly or the Champs Élysées.
Professor Lindenbrook,
I have just lost my husband.
I have nothing else to live for any more up here.
- Down there I can represent his name.
- The decision is not yours to make.
The police require your presence for the investigation into the death.
I have already given my testimony.
But, madam, quite apart from the appalling danger, think of the inconvenience.
The lack of privacy.
In short, you don't want all of this.
I may be mad on the subject of this journey, but I am not stupid!
To burden myself with a female is sheer stupidity!
I resent that word. I may have been a disturbance to men, never a burden.
This is an absolute holdup!
You will not receive one iota of extra consideration.
You'll sleep where we sleep, eat what we eat and wash when we wash.
Then you accept my proposition.
Professor, look!
There's our gateway!
Thank you, Scartaris!
Never was there a brighter sunrise.
Now we descend into oblivion or... we enter the great book of history.
Roll call.
Carla Goetaborg.
- Alexander McEwen.
- Hans and Gertrude Belker.
Oliver S Lindenbrook.
What did he say? Hans and who?
And Gertrude.
Professor!
Professor!
All right, you've arrived.
- Rather an alarming descent.
- I found it exhilarating.
I wonder if Madam Goetaborg will change her mind.
You make my mouth water.
- Hans is tying the rope on her.
- I'm a fool.
I should have told him to tie her to a mule and send her back where she belongs.
In what language would you have told him that?
All right, she may be of some use in that respect.
And then there's always the blessed chance the rope may break.
- Are you all right, ma'am?
- Quite.
Hans insisted on a double rope, you see.
- Did he indeed? How solicitous.
- But that was for Gertrude.
Poor Sir Oliver, stuck with a woman.
If only you could see your face.
That's my consolation, madam.
I don't have to look at it. You do.
- There isn't enough rope in all Europe.
- Perhaps this is the wrong entrance.
The sign was unmistakable.
But there's no other way to continue.
Gertrude!
Gertrude!
He says there's a tunnel on the other side... slanting downhill but walkable.
Eureka!
Thank you.
Now then, a general summary.
A: We must never use more than two Ruhmkorff lamps at a time.
B: We will not be needing our breathing equipment for a long stretch.
Nevertheless, none of us must ever take a step without it.
C: Use canteens freely for now. There'll be plenty of mineral springs on our way.
As my husband's charts indicated.
Is Professor Goetaborg to be with us on our entire journey, madam?
Sorry.
Well, every journey begins with a first step.
May the good Lord be with us.
Onward.
And let's have some music.
Alec, will you start us off?
Miss Jenny.
I saw you turn pale when the dominie spoke of those in peril at the far ends of the earth.
The far ends of the earth - at least that would be somewhere.
There was a clipping in a Stockholm paper.
A dispatch from Reykjavik.
- I can only read their names.
- I had it translated.
The last news was that they went up Mount
Sneffels with some heavily laden donkeys.
Yes?
And then the animals came down without their packs.
- And?
- And that's all.
Oliver S Lindenbrook, Alexander McEwen,
Hans Belker and... Madam...
- What's it?
- It seems a woman went with them.
A woman!
You know what they'll call that in the Royal Observatory at Greenwich?
A slight tremor, coming from undefined regions.
Well, we've lived through a slight tremor. Let us proceed.
It seems to be moving away from us.
Madam, in these regions I'd never venture to say that anything is moving away - or coming towards us.
The only thing we can be certain of is that danger is always with us.
We might as well ignore it.
Run!
Jump!
The three notches.
The three notches of Arne Saknussem.
- What does that mean?
- We've been shown the right path.
Alec, the plumb bob.
Look. Without these marks, we would have gone astray.
We'd have wasted months exploring endlessly.
We might have taken any one of these channels.
But our great colleague maketh a path for our feet.
Well, you all deserve a rest. Let us have tea.
With a double ration of raisins.
May I comb my hair first, Professor?
Ladies on the left, gentlemen on the right.
What is it, madam?
If we'd known that you had nightmares, we'd have made different sleeping arrangements.
Someone is walking up there.
I heard footsteps. Human footsteps.
Madam, since the beginning of time all women have heard footsteps up there.
My hearing is extremely acute.
The hearing of all women is extremely acute.
My wife used to hear rats in the attic, usually the nights before I had an important lecture.
I used to go up, armed with a broom.
Alec, go up and find out. Hans.
Madam, will you leave those men alone?
They need rest.
Moreover, it was stipulated that I give the orders.
There's no need to use that patient voice with me.
Would you rather I used an impatient voice?
Professor Lindenbrook,
I am a member of this expedition, and as such I intend to report any observation I make.
Alec.
Put it down in the record that a member of the expedition reported... rats in the attic.
Lights out.
Don't be afraid, madam.
I'm right here.
Conceal these marks completely.
I'll give them some new ones.
This is steeper than anything we've encountered.
It's just as well we all had a good night's rest.
Alec, take this down.
"21st day of our descent."
"Starting from an estimated depth of 129km, limestone formation continues."
Kai-ai, Professor.
Here are the three notches again.
Good.
- Gertrude, wrong turn.
- Let's see. What have we here?
One heads 220º south-southwest, the other 160º south-southeast.
Strange. I would have wagered we'd have to bear in that direction.
That was Gertrude's feeling too.
Are you sure your compass is right?
Quite.
What's he saying?
Hans is wondering about the ultimate goal of our expedition.
- He's asking why.
- Alec, suppose you tell him.
Well, why does man freeze to death trying to reach the North Pole?
Why does man drive himself to suffer the steam and heat of the Amazon?
Why does he stagger his mind with the mathematics of the sky?
Once a question has arisen in the human brain, the answer must be found if it takes 100 years. 1,000 years.
Let's hear you render that into a few well-chosen Icelandic words.
Why not simply tell him scientists have bats in their belfries?
Are you all right? Can you unhook yourself?
Hans.
- Grab his hand.
- I didn't see it.
Never mind about that.
How is it possible?
This way was clearly indicated.
There must have been a quake since Arne Saknussem's day.
This is no recent fissure. This has been here since the beginning of time.
I was not in a position to observe it scientifically.
We've made a mistake somewhere. But where?
What are you doing here?
We're supposed to stay together.
And we must never have more than two lamps.
We've been tricked.
Tricked into the wrong tunnel.
Those three notches are not Arne Saknussem's.
She's right, Professor.
Someone has passed through before us.
No need to ask who.
Madam... heard him last night.
Now she's saying "I told you so."
Silently, I admit, but she's saying it.
When I wish to say something,
Professor, I say it - aloud.
Due to this development, I have no choice but to break up the expedition.
- We must return.
- Why?
You don't strike me as a man who frightens easily.
I'm not thinking of myself. You know that.
- I must think of you, a woman.
- We agreed I was to be one of your men.
- But if there is a madman loose...
- He's against all of us.
Against the very concept of this journey.
What's happened? What's he saying?
He said we should go back to where Alec fell.
But it's not on our route. If we're to go ahead, we have no time for detours.
Then you wait here.
If only my Jenny were here to see this.
Madam, now that the boy has gone and Hans doesn't understand English,
I must ask rather a delicate question.
I'm blushing already.
You're wearing... stays, are you not?
Professor!
Yes, I thought so.
I can hear them creaking as you walk along.
What I wear is not your business.
Everything is my business. We'll look the other way while you discard them.
Professor, you go too far.
We're approaching regions of excessive heat.
Nothing must impede anyone's breathing in any way.
Alec! Leaving in a few minutes!
I've got to take a specimen of this back to Edinburgh, if it's the last thing I do.
Unique. Inexplicable.
All right, ready to go, if that boy Alec would be good enough to appear.
Where the devil is he?
It's a blind alley!
Keep back!
Professor!
Hans!
Good God!
Hold on. Hold on to my arm... my shoulder!
Little bit... Hold on. That's it.
Praise the Lord!
Alec.
Professor!
Hello! Hello!
Professor! Professor! Here I am!
Salt.
Alec!
Alec!
Professor.
Professor, you can't go on this way.
I've kept track of the passage of days.
- You haven't.
- We'll try the cross-channel over there.
We were in that channel yesterday.
We left marks.
- You won't find him there.
- I've got to find him. I'm responsible.
Look.
No need to translate.
I can see that this is a recent break.
Alec!
Can you hear me?
If you're down there, give us a sign!
Alec, listen carefully. When the echoes stop, you must try to answer.
If you're injured, if you can't talk, make an effort.
Pick up a pebble and scratch the rock.
We'll hear you, I promise you.
Just give us a sign.
A phosphorescent pool.
A strange grave for a young Scot.
Professor, there's no use.
How can I live with myself?
Accept his loss, like one soldier accepts the loss of another soldier.
You must continue with what you started.
You must go on with the Lindenbrook Expedition.
- The Lindenbrook Expedition!
- Yes. Go on with it.
It was his project as much as it was yours.
Yes, you're right.
We will proceed. But we won't call it the Lindenbrook Expedition any more.
From now on it's the Alec McEwen Expedition.
No broken bones? Ribs all right?
Good. Get up.
Down there, food and water. Refresh yourself.
So you've lost your friends? Just as well.
It's my servant.
Too much heat, too much load... too much fear.
You're younger. You'll do to carry my things.
I'm not your servant, Count Saknussem.
Pride? Rather out of place here. Eat, drink, then pick up those things. I'm in a hurry.
- To steal the professor's project?
- Steal?
Listen, young foreigner,
I don't have to steal what belongs to me.
You're in my world now.
Stop. I need someone to carry my equipment.
You will never find your companions or your way out. You need me as much as I need you.
You found me. My friends could find me too.
Very well. You'll carry it with one arm, not two!
- A hail of bullets.
- No, no.
It's a multiple echo, reverberating through the rock chambers.
The last echo will give us the direction.
166º south-southeast.
Alec. Alec.
Alec. Alec!
We'd given you up, but you're alive, laddie.
You're alive!
Professor.
Hans.
Just to see you...
Where was he?
I... I didn't think he'd shoot, but he did.
Of course I did. What did you expect?
You are trespassers here.
I am the owner of this domain.
You are also the murderer of my husband.
I claimed my rights. He would not listen.
Count Saknussem, in the name of your great ancestor, put down that preposterous gun.
No harm will come of it if you accept my terms.
You will go back the way you came, but you will leave the equipment I need and that man.
You're not going to listen to a murderer?
Never interrupt a murderer, madam.
I resent that bourgeois classification.
I'll spare your lives.
You have my word of honor.
Give me your hand on that.
A bourgeois trick.
So sorry.
Now then, before we continue on our journey, we must perform a solemn duty.
We have to hold court.
Here, hundreds of kilometers beneath the surface of the earth, we are the law.
The defendant stands accused of one murder and one act of mayhem.
To preserve legal formalities
I must ask you, as jurors, is the defendant guilty or not guilty?
Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Then the mandatory sentence is death.
There are two bullets left. Madam, will you be good enough to explain to Hans?
We will follow the route marked by the notches.
He is to wait here for ten minutes, then carry out the sentence.
- No, no, no, no, no.
- I can carry something with my left hand.
You can carry yourself for a couple of days.
That's all we can expect.
Sir Oliver, there's a slight problem.
Our friend Hans refuses to shoot the count.
What do you mean, "refuses"?
It's a court order.
It seems his family have been loyal to the Saknussems for generations and, well, he cannot touch the gun.
This is contempt of court.
- All right, Alec.
- No, no, Professor... I mean, Sir Oliver.
You mustn't look at me. I, um...
I couldn't pull the trigger with my left hand.
Oh, no. You... you couldn't consider for a moment that I could do it.
- After all, I'm a woman.
- I see.
For weeks you've been denying your sex, and now you fall back on it.
I would say the natural executioner would be the leader of the expedition.
We must face the truth, sir.
We're much too civilized to... to do away with a fellow human being.
What do you propose? Drag him with us?
Feed him? Let him share our glory?
Stop fiddling with those lamps.
What's he jabbering about?
I'll tell you what he's saying.
The lamps are giving out.
And I'll give you the reason. The induction coils have been corroded by the salt.
To save what we can, I insist that we leave these regions at once.
You insist?!
As a matter of fact, he's bloody well right. Let's be off.
You realize Saknussem's unfastened himself from the rope again and gone off?
What's the harm?
He'll be back when it's time to eat.
The harm is, madam, that he's wasting a lamp.
Madam, will you try your lamp, please?
- It's dead.
- Yours, Alec?
When these things are gone, they're really gone.
Madam, make a final note, while you've still light enough to write by.
- Let me, madam. My arm's quite well now.
- No need.
"We've covered another 92km."
"Temperature dropped seven degrees."
"It's surprisingly cooler than anticipated... but darkness is closing about us."
"This may be our last entry."
Hans and I can cut some rope into some torches.
That's a good idea. What puzzles me is that the three notches of old Arne Saknussem still keep pointing our way.
What kind of a lamp did he have?
Perhaps my ancestor did not require a lamp.
From here on neither do you, Sir Oliver.
Why don't you turn it off?
Yes, just switch it off.
Why, it's miraculous!
Look at this.
What is it, sir?
A form of algae with the property of luminescence.
Light without heat. A cool, chemical light.
You've seen fireflies, madam, and glowworms, and forms of life in the sea that generate their own light.
The same principle is involved here.
"256th day."
"The phenomenal winds vanished as abruptly as they came."
"We are now in a stupendous deposit of cinnabar."
What's that curious mark you make on every page?
ME. McEwen Expedition.
So whenever I've said
Lindenbrook Expedition, you've written McEwen Expedition?
May I remind you that months ago you gave me explicit orders to that effect?
You may not remind me! I do not wish to be corrected by you incessantly.
Is that what I'm doing?
You're doing it with your looks, the inflection of your voice, the very posture of your body.
Your entire presence is a constant criticism of me.
I'm tired of it. I've had enough.
You've had enough.
Well, let me tell you, you dried-up walnut of a man, if anyone's had enough, it's me.
- It's I.
- It's I, it's me!
It's Carla Goetaborg! I quit! I am leaving!
May I send for madam's horse and carriage?
Well...
Well, at least you know I have a temper.
And from now on Alec will keep the charts.
Alec! Alec!
Why can't he stay around?
Kai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai!
Mushrooms! A forest of mushrooms!
They may be hundreds of years old, but the small ones we can eat! They're delicious.
To think they grew without sun this far under the earth!
All the food we can eat!
It's tougher than leather.
We'll have new soles for our shoes.
It's like an oak tree.
Madam, you're magnificent. Mushroom steak, mushroom soup, mushroom hash.
Let me say this. If we'd had one more week of that salted beef, I would have perished.
Don't be too happy.
After some months of this, you'll be smacking your lips at the thought of salt beef.
Yes, months, months.
If we only knew how many more.
There's no term to the work of a scientist.
Let me say this, madam.
If you hadn't been along, this whole journey would have been unbearable.
But that's not
Professor Lindenbrook's feeling.
It's mine.
You see, we have no sun, no moon and no stars.
But then you're here.
And what is the name of the girl you love?
- I beg your pardon?
- The girl you love?
- What's her name?
- Jenny.
But why would you want to know thatjust now?
Dear Alec! There are times when it's advisable to jog a young man's memory.
Professor?
Here's some hot mushroom porridge for you, Sir Oliver.
I slept as I never slept in Edinburgh.
No street noises, no church bells, no clatter of pans from the kitchen.
I may move here permanently.
What's our large friend doing over there?
I don't know.
Special command of His Majesty.
Is that madman still giving orders?
This is supposed to be his rest period.
The minute you fell asleep he went off in that direction, through the tunnel.
He came back long enough to order the felling of the mushrooms.
What in the world can he want with all those?
You've come to ask me why I didn't take my rest period.
I don't sleep. I hate those little slices of death.
- It's a sea.
- It's an ocean with waves and currents.
The ocean of the underworld.
Some earthquake, before the beginning of history, cracked wide open the great sea and through the fissures poured this.
The fissures closed again.
No map ever recorded the Saknussem Ocean.
I so christened it while you were asleep.
It's the prerogative of the discoverer.
I congratulate you.
You realize, Lindenbrook, that from now on there will be no notches to follow.
That's why you ordered a raft. I approve.
A dimetrodon!
If I had my gun, we'd have fresh meat for dinner.
That's what he's seen. He's a flesh eater.
- Can he swim?
- No, thank God.
The wind blowing down the high street!
Here.
I brought you some nice apples.
- I wonder if it's cold where they are.
- Where they are. Indeed.
Are they anyplace?
McEwen, put that toy away and take over the rudder.
Yes, sir.
- I didn't tell you to throw it away.
- It flew out of my hand!
My watch!
- Save the instruments.
- What's happening?
My ring! My wedding ring.
A field of force that snatches gold away.
This is it! This is it!
The junction of magnetic forces from the North Pole and South Pole!
The center of the earth!
Hang on!
Hold on to your rope!
No!
Is everyone here?
Madam Goetaborg,
Alec, Hans.
Gertrude.
And His Highness over there.
So... the expedition with all the names... ends like this.
We're alive, aren't we?
After all, we did hit the center of the earth.
It hit us, laddie.
No need to tell us, madam.
He wants to know where we go from here.
Tired minds don't plan well.
Sleep first, plan later.
When I refused to eat my porridge when I was a boy, my mother - like all mothers - used to say
"Oliver, the day may come when you'd very much like to have that porridge."
Why do you look so surprised? Is it incredible to you that I ever had a mother?
I was just thinking how proud she'd be of that little boy who wouldn't eat his porridge.
Here, duck.
Here, duck.
Gertrude?
Gertrude?
Gertrude?
Gertrude!
Gertrude!
Gertrude! Gertrude!
Gertrude!
Hans! Hans!
Why do you look at me like that?
Hans!
I needed food, so I took it.
Professor, tell your man to calm himself.
I'm not in the mood to engage in a dispute about a slaughtered duck.
Professor, stop him! Stop this fool!
- Hans!
- Hans!
You ingrates! What can you do without me?
Only I can show you the way out of this realm of mine.
Look out!
This is the sunken city.
After 5,000 years, behold a fragment of the lost Atlantis.
All we know about it comes from the Greek.
The floor of the sea opened up and swallowed the whole island of Atlantis.
This must have been the market square.
Professor. Professor, this looks like some sort of inn.
It is an inn. An eating place, certainly.
"Eating." What a word.
What a wonderful word.
Well, we've learned one thing about the inhabitants of Atlantis.
They ate oysters.
Stale bread. We must speak to the baker.
Madam! Madam!
Já?
- He's asking if that was a temple to their god.
- Yes, I'm sure it is.
It's some sort of altar stone where the sacred flame burned.
- It's serpentine, isn't it?
- Exactly. A massive form of asbestos.
To think that at a moment like this
I've no pad and pencil to record it all.
Turn around, madam. Don't look.
What is it?
The great Arne Saknussem, I presume.
So this is as far as you came.
What's the matter with you two?
Say "how do you do" to a brave man.
He must have dragged himself here with a broken leg. Look at that tibia.
- You won't find anything edible in there.
- Why not?
The Chinese eat eggs over 400 years old.
Gunpowder.
Professor, look at his right hand.
It's pointing somewhere.
To that shaft over there.
Of course! Of course!
This is what the pointing finger meant!
This is the way up.
He couldn't make it, but we can!
This is the volcanic chimney.
The violent updraft can mean only one thing:
A direct hatchway to the surface.
- And we can climb up.
- Madam, explain to Hans.
Let him venture 100 meters or so on reconnoiter.
The updraft can't carry him away.
Now I'd say let's roll up our sleeves - if we had any.
We mustn't hope for much.
This light won't stay with us.
- We'll have to provide some kind of light.
- And food.
I'll go see what I can find.
I'll comb every inch of Atlantis.
If we only had some shears, we could cut it off.
Could we?
Kai-ai! Kai-ai!
Kai-ai! Kai-ai!
Flints! I've found some flints.
Good lad. We won't be walking in darkness.
I wish I had better news. It gives every indication of being a perfect passage upward, straighter than the one we descended.
- But...
- But? But?
There's an obstacle. A gigantic block of stone obstructs the passageway.
Hans said only a landslide could ever move it.
No, let him be.
If his hopes hadn't been so high...
- Alec!
- Yes, sir?
The haversack -
Arne Saknussem's haversack. Get it.
If God is with us and that gunpowder has kept its ginger over the years, we'll make that landslide ourselves.
Now, my wonderful companions, you realize, I hope, that we're taking an enormous chance.
But it's our only chance.
I guarantee that this'll blow up the obstructing rock.
Whether the surrounding rocks will take the disturbance lightly, I cannot guarantee.
Let's get what protection we can.
Into the altar stone.
Dear God, ruler of heaven and earth...
Don't set any limit to his realm, laddie.
God of the universe, we are in thy merciful hands.
- Look out!
- Run, Professor! A monster!
Let me go!
We've started an earthquake!
The lava is pushing us up!
- It's an earthquake of unusual magnitude!
- More likely it's a volcanic eruption.
Listen to this. "Stromboli, Italy.
First eyewitness report."
"The capsule of the dead volcano broke under a tremendous explosion."
"Rocks of extraordinary size are being spewed out into the sea."
Dammi una mano.
Piano. Piano.
- Passami il vino.
- Ecco.
Signora, beva, beva.
Where's Alec?
Hans says... Alec was thrown from the altar stone... long before we hit the water.
Non si preoccupi. Abbiamo uno scalino.
I'm most grateful, ladies, but my immediate need is not a ladder.
I need trousers. Pants.
Pantaloons. Pantaloons.
- Vuole i pantaloni.
- Pantaloni.
Don't bring them yourselves.
Send a friar, a monk.
Excuse me, ladies.
Excuse me.
Lindenbrook! Lindenbrook!
Speech! Speech!
Fellow Scots, if these shouts of yours express some pleasure that we've returned alive, I thank you deeply.
However, if they're meant as praise for a successful scientist,
I must disclaim that honor.
No. A scientist who cannot prove what he has accomplished has accomplished nothing.
I have no records, no shred of evidence.
I will never embarrass this distinguished university by asking that it take my word.
Let me say only this.
300 years ago a daring man undertook a perilous journey and never came back.
We followed his path and returned, by the grace of God - and a heathen altar stone.
One day someone else - it may be you, my boy, or your sons or your grandsons - will pick up where we left off.
This, I know: The spirit of man cannot be stopped.
Splendid, Oliver. Splendid speech.
Professor, here's someone who wants to say goodbye.
His ship sails at four.
Hans, old friend.
We never could have done without you.
He has a speech.
If you... if you will ever go down there again, the center earth, Hans will go too.
Thank you.
Did you get your injuries when the volcano blew up, in the hot lava?
No, it happened at our wedding.
He was in such a hurry leaving the church, he fell all the way down the steps.
You poor wee bride. After all that waiting.
It's been no marriage for you at all.
You underestimate Alec.
I'm taking the night train to London and then back to Stockholm.
Stockholm? But you have ajob to do here in Edinburgh.
- I?
- I intend to write my memoirs.
I can't remember everything that happened alone.
Oh, I see. What you need is a widow who can jog your memory and take dictation.
I suppose I'm to report every day from nine till twelve, from two to six?
No, none of that nonsense.
You can stay in my house.
And what would Edinburgh say?
It's one thing to spend one's days and nights with a man under the earth, another under one roof in Scotland.
Well, uh... what do you propose?
That's not a word I'd bandy about, Professor.
What did I say? Which word?
I thought it would catch in your throat.
Madam. Madam.
Thank you. Madam Goetaborg.
Frau Goetaborg!
Carla!
Yes... Oliver?
Carla...
I warn you...
I'm wearing stays again.

Harufa!
Aye, captain.
Sound for a depth.
A sounding?
Here?
Aye.
Aye, captain.
Does he expect to land here, past the very end of land?
Perhaps hunger has crazed his mind.
His belly is as empty as ours.
If there was land...
...it would be land no man would dare set foot upon.
Sinbad would.
He dares anything.
Captain!
Full fathom seven!
Sharp lookout there!
Aye, captain!
What can it be?
Perhaps a sunken reef.
Or a sea serpent.
Or something worse.
Full fathom five!
Let it be land.
Land ho!
Off the port bow!
He has the eyes of an owl.
I see nothing.
Look! There!
Land it is!
All hands, look alive!
Drop anchor. We'll go ashore at the first light of dawn.
May Allah grant we find food and water.
And may Allah grant we find nothing more.
This is no time to come to a lady's bedroom.
I bring good news to your mistress.
I know your sailor's tricks.
Now, off with you.
Go steer your course elsewhere.
Sadi...
...you must be more polite to the captain.
He's not responsible for the winds...
...which blew us off our course.
Or are you?
I blame him for taking you from the safety of your father's palace...
...to this.
I came willingly, Sadi.
What good news, captain?
We're anchoring off an island.
Tomorrow we take on food and water to continue our voyage.
The food comes none too soon.
That pirate Harufa has already found eyes for my pet.
In a week, you'll be feasting in Bagdad.
At our wedding.
I think you invented the island for just this purpose.
For another such kiss...
...I'd invent a whole continent.
Bananas! Melon!
Here, have a coconut.
And grapes!
Captain Sinbad is filling his cask with fresh water.
Stay until he returns.
A cloven hoof.
Here! There's another.
What a stride.
Captain Sinbad...
...look!
Captain!
What is it?
It has the mark of an ancient civilization.
It has the mark of Satan himself.
Come, let us go back to the ship.
Hold this.
I'm going to see where that stone mouth leads.
Help me! Help me!
Help me!
To the boat, quickly!
From the land beyond beyond...
...from the world past hope and fear...
...I bid you, genie, now appear.
I obey the master of the lamp.
I command you to build me a barrier...
...between those men and the Cyclops.
I shall try, O master.
I shall try.
What weird power restrains that monster?
The man who holds this treasure is safe from even greater danger.
Why didn't you destroy the monster?
The genie of the lamp cannot be used to work harm.
But in protection his powers are invincible.
Look out!
Help!
Help!
Oh, my prayer is answered.
You are safe.
Hoist all sails!
Full starboard rudder!
Head to sea!
The lamp!
The lamp!
My lamp!
For your ship, a king's ransom in jewels.
You forget one thing, my friend.
The Cyclopes will be on guard now.
Besides their strength, they have the lamp as well.
The Cyclopes have no speech.
It is useless to them.
I alone can invoke the power of the genie.
Who are you?
I am Sokurah.
The magician.
Is your lamp so precious that you'd risk your life to go back there?
There is nothing I would not do to regain it.
Your ambition nearly cost us our lives already.
If you're a magician...
...why do you not use your power to slay the one-eyed monster?
I had prepared a potion for just such a purpose...
...but I could not persuade the Cyclops to swallow it.
The winds that drove your ship to the island of Colossa...
...have wrecked many vessels on its shores.
The treasure of 100 years has been gathered by the Cyclopes.
The wealth that awaits us there...
...is worth many, many thousand times what you see here.
We're on a mission for the caliph of Bagdad.
It means the difference between war and peace.
I'll not risk turning back.
That is my final word.
Perhaps when you are safely in Bagdad...
...you'll be persuaded to feel differently about the venture.
I doubt it.
Harufa, show the magician to his quarters.
With fair winds, we should reach port in five days.
Magician! Your jewels.
My lord Sinbad is a very great prince in his country.
The people rejoice for the news I bring.
Peace between your father's kingdom and ours.
And do you love me just to save Bagdad from destruction?
I love you because
I cannot do otherwise.
Your eyes are mightier than all your father's armies.
Three times welcome, Sinbad.
You have done wonders to avert a war.
And what fair prize is this?
Princess Parisa, daughter of the sultan of Chandra.
Pledged to be my bride...
...a symbol of lasting friendship between our kingdoms.
Welcome as a daughter, my child.
For I love Sinbad as my own son.
I thank you, kind sir.
My father sends his wish for your health...
...and bids me tell you he'll arrive within a week for our wedding.
A royal wedding it shall be, with all honours.
Tell me about your journey.
Oh, a strange voyage and a strange tale it is, my caliph.
I did not think any place could be more beautiful than Chandra...
...yet Bagdad is.
The city is made lovely by your presence.
Without you, it is plain.
Now that we are here, all the strange terrors of the voyage seem unreal.
Yet they were all too real at the time.
Perhaps it is all a dream, and the one-eyed giant a nightmare.
And is Sokurah, the magician, also a dream?
He is very real indeed.
Something about him frightens me.
If only he would vanish when I awaken.
He's determined to gain possession of the magic lamp.
His life is distorted with a single driving wish.
I pity him...
...for I have my one wish.
Illustrious and magnificent caliph of Bagdad...
...I am honoured to be summoned by you.
Sinbad says you are a man of unusual powers.
It's my wish you show your skill at a welcome feast for the sultan.
Your wish shall be granted before it is asked.
I promise a performance that will live in your memory for all the days...
...may you live 1000 years.
You please me already.
Your palace is a jewel of comfort and hospitality, but...
- But?
- My happiness would be complete...
...if you would but grant me a single wish.
- State it.
- A fast ship...
...and a well-armed crew to return to my island.
Ships are costly, and lives are not to be wasted.
I have here the design of a new weapon.
A giant crossbow...
...to protect the men from harm.
I cannot judge, for I haven't seen the one-eyed giant.
Sinbad, what is your opinion?
Tales of our voyage have crossed Bagdad.
Only a madman would sail back to Colossa.
Sinbad's word...
...is my word.
Until the sultan's feast then?
Are you sure you can be happy here in Bagdad?
Very. I love Sinbad more with every sunrise.
I had such doubts after I let you go.
If anything had happened to you, they would have paid with many lives.
Father, you're getting angry.
You mustn't, you know.
Here comes the caliph now.
Smile at him. He's a very nice man.
May your illustrious presence...
...return to your own house a thousand folds.
If my daughter is happy,
I have honour enough.
Daughter.
Remember, not only will you triumph over good and evil...
...but you will be the most exotic woman in all of Bagdad.
- What must I do?
- Leave everything to me.
I've arranged a presentation which I think will arouse your interest.
Summon Sokurah, the magician.
Is that not Sadi, your waiting-woman?
Yes, Papa.
She has offered herself as the magician's subject.
If he can turn her into a contented woman, he is indeed a great magician.
It's a serpent.
She'll be killed!
Allah have mercy on them both.
Oh, Papa!
Behold!
It is impossible!
I am asleep.
If so, I share your dream.
Sadi!
- Are you all right?
- I assure you she is unharmed.
Well done, Sokurah.
If I have pleased you,
I hope you will grant my request...
...for an expedition to my island of Colossa.
You are truly a man of great skill...
...but I do not change my mind so easily.
Perhaps a further demonstration of my powers is necessary.
The art of prophecy has always fascinated me.
Can you foretell the future?
I can, upon occasion, foretell certain events.
It would please us to have you tell the future of our two countries.
As you wish.
I shall require a brazier of live coals.
You shall have it.
Guards!
May the unseen forces grant that I see nothing but good.
My spirit races ahead of time itself.
Ask your questions.
What do you see here in Bagdad?
I see...
...but I cannot speak.
You must!
I see...
...great disaster.
I see...
I cannot tell!
Go on. I command you!
There are great buildings falling.
Women and children slain.
I see war!
War between Bagdad and Chandra!
You lie!
What of my daughter's wedding?
There will be no wedding.
Mysterious and evil forces are at work...
...and the wedding rejoicing shall be turned to mourning!
You have done well, Sinbad.
I could not let him frighten the princess.
I spoke at your insistence.
The events my spirit saw lurk as dire possibilities.
If you request...
...I will use my powers to disperse the evil forces...
...and avert such disaster.
Then I presume I must grant you the ship and sailors you desire.
Such a gift of gratitude would seem fitting.
So your lies are cheap schemes...
...to force me to grant your wish.
Get out! You have committed treason against both Bagdad and Chandra.
If you're found within the walls of our city by sunset tomorrow...
...your eyes will be torn out...
...that you may see no more evil dreams.
To the wedding, and our lasting friendship.
Good night.
Though I wish the night were gone.
Tomorrow will come soon.
And all the nights thereafter cannot come soon enough.
I cannot imagine waking to see your face, instead of Sadi's.
She was indeed transformed tonight by that magician.
- Suppose that his prophecy...
- I'll dream of dangers he predicted...
...so you can rescue me.
The wedding procession will pass here...
...then pause at the throne, where you and I will be seated equally.
My lord! My lord!
Where is she?
Where is my daughter?
The princess!
Sinbad, here I am!
Sinbad, look!
Here on the pillow.
Look closely!
No, it cannot be!
It is.
- The world's grown very large overnight.
- It's true.
It is you, my darling.
My daughter, where is she?
Where is my...
Ten thousand devils!
What evil sorcery is this?
My daughter, is it you?
Speak! Tell me my eyes lie.
You see truly, my father.
I would have borne any insult.
But my dear one...
...my daughter!
Look upon your city.
Enjoy the sight...
...for soon it will be rubble and bleached bones.
Sokurah!
Sokurah, wait.
- The princess...
- I know.
In my vision, I saw her state.
But I feared to tell you because of your anger.
Tell me, can you help her?
Possibly.
No!
No! The risk would be too great.
If she can be helped,
I will do anything.
I cannot turn back.
If I am in Bagdad at sundown, my eyes will be dark forever.
I'll answer to the caliph for that.
No, l...
Tell us what must be done.
There is one potion which will remove the evil charm.
- Mix the potion, quickly.
- We lack the most vital ingredient.
A piece of shell from the egg of a giant bird called the roc.
Monstrous bird that nests on the peaks of Colossa.
Without this shell, the potion is useless.
We have no choice. I must sail at once and bring back the eggshell.
No. The princess must go with us.
Only in my castle can the potion be used.
I'll order a ship at once.
We'll need your design for the giant crossbow.
The palace jeweler can make a tiny home for Parisa.
Where will you find a crew, Sinbad?
The bravest of my former men will come.
That won't be enough.
Where will you find the others?
I'll find them...
...where men fear the headman's ax over the Cyclops. In the prison yard.
Hear me!
Hear!
Come here!
I am Captain Sinbad. I am here with an offer of freedom.
I have come to raise a crew for the hard and dangerous voyage to Colossa.
The land of the Cyclopes!
We may be thieves and murderers...
...but we're not fools.
The caliph has offered you full pardon.
He offers a choice of two kinds of death.
I fought the Cyclops and here I stand, alive.
This man was there.
He sails with me again.
What will it be?
We need five and 20 men.
Freedom...
...or the hangman's noose?
They'll not kill Golar!
He'll spit in the Cyclops' eye first!
- That's right.
- I'll sign up.
- Let's go!
- Me too.
Take me!
The ship's hold is filled with the giant crossbow.
- Then lash the arrow to the mast.
- Aye, aye, captain.
Careful! We'll need that arrow to fight for our lives!
We're all fools.
If we're to fight for our lives, let us fight against men, not monsters.
There are rich prizes plying in the coastal waters.
This vessel could be ours for the taking.
What of those men who are loyal to the captain?
We'll feed them to the fish.
Heave!
Heave! Heave!
I fear this will be a tedious voyage for you.
I shall never complain, not as long as I'm near you.
A hazardous voyage too, in spite of all the plans we made.
If you were as small as I, you could walk among the giants unseen.
They're not our only danger.
We must sail uncharted waters with a doubtful crew.
I wonder what they would think, if they could see me as I am.
I do not trust them out of my sight, or in it.
Yes?
Captain, can I have a few words with you?
For the past week, there's been unrest among the crew.
I've heard dangerous mutterings.
All weapons are locked up.
Without weapons, they can do nothing.
In a few more days, we should reach the island.
Something troubles your appetite, Sinbad.
I shall be glad when we arrive.
Sinbad...
...how can you love a tiny...
...insignificant female, such as I?
A diamond is a tiny thing...
...yet very precious and beautiful.
Quickly, princess!
Stop! Do not kill him!
We surrender!
Harufa, we must give up.
This is a touching show of friendship.
Take his sword.
Here! The magician's cloak...
...will make a flag for us.
Here are the men who would feed us to the one-eyed monster.
What shall we do with them?
Kill them! Drown them!
You hear the verdict.
You die at dawn.
And my wish for a night of pleasant dreams.
Hear my curse, for it seals your doom.
Those who harm us shall be driven mad!
Terror shall be in your hearts.
Before dawn, you will plead with us for your very lives.
Oh, save me.
Oh, save us, magician.
Save us!
For you, I will tie the knot myself.
So you will strangle slowly.
Throw him in the forward hold!
Helmsman!
Take a course due south.
We'll circle back to the trade routes. Go on!
We could have sliced them to bits...
...but you stopped us to save this idiot...
...who babbles nonsense.
You will see.
Winds and currents will drive the ship southward...
...and my prophecy will come true.
How can you be certain?
South of Colossa lies an accursed island...
...inhabited by wailing demons.
Their screaming is heard over a hundred leagues.
Men hearing it are driven mad.
They drive their ships onto the jagged rocks and are devoured by sea serpents.
What's to prevent us from sharing their fate?
If we stuff cloth in our ears.
Well, that's fine.
Now we won't be driven mad.
We'll just be devoured by sea monsters.
If we wax the cloth, it will stop most of the sound.
The wind screams like 10,000 fiends!
Full port rudder!
Change your course!
We'll be wrecked on the rocks!
Ho, lookout!
What can you see?
Hold this course...
...or you'll die!
Steer south!
High winds and seas surround the demon island.
The sound penetrates even here.
Give me that glass!
Full port bow!
I'm going to release them.
Full port rudder!
Save us!
Save us, captain...
...before we're wrecked.
There's a narrow channel through the rocks. It is our only chance.
Has the whole ship gone mad?
Full port rudder!
Full port rudder!
Sharp lookout for the peaks of Colossa!
The crossbow will be ready within the hour.
Keep the men at the crossbow.
I'd rather go with you.
I know, but you're more valuable here.
Everything is ready.
The sooner we leave, the better. Come.
Here.
- Who's in command of the great crossbow?
- You are.
This is the valley of the Cyclopes.
In the centre of the island are the peaks where the great birds nest.
- Then our path lies through the valley?
- Your path.
We separate into two groups.
Because if one group is captured, the other may attempt to free them.
We meet at the far side of the valley...
...tonight at sunset.
May the powers of good protect all our footsteps.
We will stop and rest here and proceed again at nightfall.
You, Golar!
Do not drink so deeply.
We'll need the water for our climb.
Why so miserly?
- We can fill the skin from the pool.
- That's right.
This water is poisoned.
The man who lets it touch his lips will be dead.
Poison?
Would you care to try it?
Wait here a moment.
What are you doing here?
Don't worry.
The crossbow's in good hands.
Let us get back to the others before the Cyclops returns.
They were here a moment ago.
See if you can find them.
Captain Sinbad!
Captain Sinbad!
Come quickly!
Here, through here. Hurry!
We're rich! We're rich!
Come, master. Take your fill!
Pearls, rubies, gold, everything!
Out of here!
There'll be time enough for treasure after we finish our mission.
Out! Hear me, or by my sword,
I'll run you through.
Let me go!
Sinbad's men must be trapped.
You will remain here.
Help me!
Sinbad, help!
Help me...
Help me! Help!
Must we thirst here...
...while water runs around us, just because of the magician?
He has strange, strange powers.
We dare not disobey.
- Golar dares.
- That's right.
Then drink from the forbidden pool.
You think he's afraid?
Here. Show them.
Hey!
That's good!
Tastes like choice wine.
Help! Sinbad!
Help me, Sinbad!
Sinbad! Help me!
Lend me a hand.
Maybe I can reach the latch.
Sokurah!
Come here.
There's a latch on top of the cage.
Try to open it.
Sokurah!
Why does he leave us?
He leaves us to share the fate of Harufa.
But we shall escape.
Escape? How?
You must never reveal what you're about to see.
- Just get us out of here.
- Save us!
Princess, there's a latch on top of this cage. Will you try to open it?
I'll do my best.
I see the latch. I'll try.
Sinbad, it is stuck!
I cannot move it.
You must try, princess.
It's our only hope.
The lamp!
It is done, Sinbad.
Lift me up.
Must we hide here so quietly while our comrades are in danger?
- Are we afraid of Sokurah?
- Who's afraid?
Then follow us.
Courage, Harufa.
Put out the fire.
Let's get out of here!
The lamp!
Here!
Here I am!
Over here!
Over here!
Closer!
Closer!
A little further.
Here!
Closer!
Look! There he is!
He's dead.
The danger is far from passed.
There are still Cyclopes alive.
I alone know the words that will summon the genie.
I should have the lamp.
I do not trust you.
When I called you to free us, you didn't open the cage.
I do not understand this lamp's power.
If we need it, it shall be safely within my grasp.
As you say.
Poor Rahan.
Allah knows many ways of dealing with hungry men.
Look, Sokurah.
We have reached our goal!
- There's something moving inside.
- It is the season for the young birds.
Higher up there will be eggs already hatched.
Come this way.
No more climbing, please.
We're starving!
Here.
Let us break open the egg!
Put down that spear!
You should not have let them do that.
Hungry men don't ask, they take.
Here. The princess must be restored without delay.
That must be combined with elements found in my cave...
...at the foot of the mountain.
That's the edge of the Cyclopes' domain.
What protects your castle from them?
You will see when we get there.
- I'm glad to breathe fresh air.
- Good news, my princess.
We have the eggshell for the potion.
Your words are happy, but your face is sad. Why are you troubled, Sinbad?
I do not trust the magician.
Our only hold over him is this lamp...
...and he alone knows the secret of its power.
Sinbad...
...let me enter the lamp.
Perhaps I can learn how to call the genie.
But is such a thing possible?
Well, who knows what's possible within a magic lamp?
Please let me try.
All right.
If all is not well, call quickly.
I will. I promise I will.
Are you all right, Parisa?
Oh, fine.
There's a wonderful mist down here.
Be careful.
Welcome, Princess Parisa.
You know who I am.
A genie knows many things.
And you're as tiny as I am.
How else could I live inside a lamp?
In such a lovely one.
Had I known how beautiful it is,
I'd have visited you long ago.
You must be truly happy here.
The most comfortable prison is still a lonely place.
But aren't you sometimes called to our world to work your wonders?
But then I'm summoned as a slave...
...to do the bidding of whoever holds the lamp.
I long to be free...
...to be an adventurer and to sail the seas as Captain Sinbad does.
But those are dreams for real boys...
...and not for a genie.
Is there no way to escape?
Perhaps someday.
But I cannot return to the real world until I'm called by my name.
What is your name?
Baronni.
I have a promise of freedom inscribed in the lamp.
Would you care to see?
I should love to see it.
It is here.
"When the big that is small...
...shall again become tall.
Into fiery rock, to rise...
...you must fall."
"When the big that is small" ...
I was big and now I'm small.
You know what it means?
I'm not sure.
But I'll make you a bargain.
If you'll help me, I'll help you.
What do you want me to do?
Tell me the magic words that call you forth from the lamp.
I like you, and I wish to help.
But I don't know.
It's a great power to grant.
In return, I promise
I'll try to help you, Baronni.
Now tell me the words that invoke your protective power.
From the land beyond beyond.
"From the land beyond beyond." Go on.
From the world past hope and fear.
"From the world past hope and fear."
I bid you, genie, now appear.
"I bid you, genie, now appear."
"I bid you, genie, now appear."
The genie was very nice to you.
Yes.
He promised to help us, if we'd help him.
We will help him.
Look!
From the land beyond beyond.
From the world past hope and fear.
I bid you, genie, now...
Harufa, the lamp!
Parisa!
Parisa!
Sokurah!
Sokurah!
Parisa.
Sokurah!
From the land beyond beyond.
From the world past hope and fear.
I bid you, genie, now appear.
Mighty Sinbad, the slave of the lamp is yours to command.
Where is Princess Parisa?
She's held by the magician...
...in his underground castle at the foot of the mountain trail.
I will meet you there.
But how will l...
Go ahead, turn it.
Inside is another wheel...
...with which to loose the dragon so that he may guard the entrance.
Sokurah!
Parisa!
I knew I could trust your Sinbad to bring the lamp to us.
Now I will show you a sight which will make your heart leap.
Behold.
Sinbad!
Sinbad, I'm here!
Come this way.
He hurries to greet his princess.
I must prepare a welcome for him.
I warn you...
...tell him to do as I ask.
Are you all right, Parisa?
Oh, yes, I'm all right.
Restore the princess at once.
I will restore her in exchange for the lamp.
At once!
The potion is already prepared.
Bring the princess here.
Give me the eggshell.
If you harm her, you die.
Sinbad?
I'm here, princess.
And now...
...if you please, my lamp.
You shall have it when we are safely at the ship.
Very well.
Let us go.
Kill.
Kill him.
We're trapped.
We must summon the genie, quickly!
From the land beyond beyond.
From the world past hope and fear.
I bid you, genie, now appear!
Command me, O princess.
Help us escape from this cave.
I shall try, O princess. I shall try.
Hold tight, princess.
What is it, princess?
I remember now.
The genie's verse.
"Into fiery rock, to rise you must fall."
I made a promise to the genie.
This is the fiery rock.
The lamp must be thrown into it so he can be set free.
If we lose his help now, we may never reach the ship alive.
And if the lamp is thrown into the flaming pit, he may be destroyed.
Still, your promise must be kept.
Let's go.
Follow!
Follow!
Kill! Kill!
Follow! Kill!
Ali!
- Ali!
- Yes, captain?
Man the crossbow.
- Take the princess to the longboat.
- Yes, captain.
Hurry! Come on! Hurry!
Hurry! Come on!
Pull!
Pull!
Follow! Follow!
Pull for your lives!
Follow! Kill!
Pull for your lives!
Head for the sea!
Farewell, Colossa.
I'm only sad about one thing.
I shall miss Harufa.
And I'll never forget our friend, Baronni.
His one wish was to sail the seas with you.
You called for Baronni?
I am here.
It's the genie!
No longer the genie, captain, but your cabin boy.
Then prepare my cabin for a celebration.
I already have, captain.
I already have.
See for yourself.
Why, it's the treasure of the Cyclopes!
I put it onboard for you...
...as sort of a wedding present.
Well done. I know you'll be as good a sailor as you were a genie.
I shall try, captain.
I shall try.

[man] It's for you, darling.
Merry Christmas.
Oh, Jim, dear.
It's the one I was admiring, isn't it?
- Trimmed with ribbons?
- [whimpering]
[Jim] Well, it has a ribbon.
[gasping]
Oh, how sweet.
- [Jim] You like her, darling?
- Oh, I love her.
What a perfectly beautiful little lady.
Come on, Lady. Over here.
That's a girl.
There, now. A nice little bed for you.
[Darling] But Jim, dear, are you sure she'll be warm enough?
[Jim] Why, of course, darling.
She'll be snug as a bug in a...
Uh-oh!
Almost forgot something.
There.
[Jim] Good night, Lady.
Now, now, don't worry, darling.
She'll go right to sleep.
No, no, Lady.
This is where you belong, right here.
- [whimpering]
- [Darling] Oh, look.
She's lonesome.
Don't you think maybe?
Just for tonight?
[Jim] Darling, if we're going to show her who's master, we must be firm from the very beginning.
[whimpering]
[Jim pounding on ceiling] Lady!
Stop that now!
Stop it!
[whimpering]
[footsteps]
[whimpering]
[Jim pounding on door] Lady!
[Jim] Quiet, now. You hear me?
Back to bed!
Quick, now.
Not one more sound.
[chiming]
[scraping]
[snoring]
- [whimpering]
- [Darling] Jim, dear.
[groaning]
[whimpering]
Aw, Jim.
[Jim] Hmm? What?
[whimpering, howling]
[Jim yawning]
[Jim] Oh, all right.
But remember, just for tonight.
[rooster crowing]
[chiming]
[Darling groaning]
[yawns] All right, Lady. All right.
I'm up. I'm up, Lady.
Oh, no!
[Darling] What's wrong, Jim? What is it?
Can't you explain to Lady about Sundays?
[barking]
[growling, barking]
[bicycle bell rings]
[Jim] Have you noticed, darling, since we've had Lady we see less and less of those disturbing headlines?
[Darling] Yes, I just don't know how we ever got along without her.
[Jim] Say, she must be about six months old.
We'd better be getting her a license.
Hope it fits.
My, but it does look nice.
So grown up.
Won't Jock and Trusty be surprised?
[humming]
Four steps straight
and then to the left
And right to the place
where I marked it
With a bonnie, bonnie bone
that I buried for me own
In my bonnie, bonnie bank
in the backyard
A-ha, that's a grand sight.
[Lady] Jock!
Oh, Jock!
Hello, Jock.
Oh! Oh, it's you, lassie. [chuckles]
Notice anything different?
Eh, uh... You've had a bath?
No, not that.
You've had your nails clipped?
[Lady] Mm-mmm. Guess again.
Well, I wouldn't a-be knowin'.
Why-o, lassie.
A bonnie new collar.
- Do you like it?
- Aye. [sniffs]
Mmm. It must be very expensive.
- Have you shown it to Trusty yet?
- No.
Ah, we'd best go at once.
You know how sensitive he is about these things.
[snoring]
[whimpering]
[snorting, howling]
He's dreaming.
[Jock] Aye.
Dreamin' of those bonnie bygone days when he and his grandfather were trackin' criminals through the swamps.
- [Lady] They were?
- That was before...
Before what?
'Tis time you knew the truth, lassie.
[Jock] It shouldn't have happened to a dog.
But, well...
Trusty has lost his sense of smell.
- [Lady gasps] No!
- [Jock] Aye.
But we must never let on that we know, lassie.
It would break his poor heart.
Uh... Which way did he go?
Which way did he go?
- Go?
- [Trusty] Yeah, big fella.
About, uh, six-foot-two.
[sniffs] No, uh, three.
Wore a striped suit. No collar.
Why, Miss Lady.
You have a collar.
Mm-hmm. And a license.
My, my.
- How time does fly.
- Aye.
It seems only yesterday she was cuttin' her teeth on Jim Dear's slippers, and now there she is, a full-grown lady.
Wearin' the greatest honour man can bestow.
The badge of faith and respectability.
That's right, Miss Lady.
As my grandpappy,
Old Reliable, used to say...
I don't recollect if I've ever mentioned Old Reliable before.
Aye, you have, laddie.
Oh, yeah.
- [whistling]
- Ooh, it's Jim Dear.
Please excuse me.
Hello, there, Lady.
Come on, beat you home.
Oh, you win again.
Steady, now.
Steady.
Well, what have we here?
Oh, big girl now, huh?
All right.
Oh, ladies first.
You know, darling, with Lady here
I'd say life is quite complete.
[Darling] Yes, dear.
I don't imagine anything could ever take her place in our hearts.
[steam hissing]
[train whistle blows]
[train chugging]
[stretching]
[shuddering]
Ah! What a day!
Well, now to dig up some breakfast.
Hmm? [chuckles]
Aw, cute little rascals.
Cootchie-cootchie-coo.
Now. That breakfast, let's see.
Bernie's?
Mmm... no.
Francois...
No, no.
Nope. Too much starch. Ah!
Tony's. Oh, that's it.
I haven't been there in a week.
[Tony] A beautiful day
to make pizza
Hey, still we call it bella notte
[scratching]
Well, buon giorno, Butch.
You want-a your breakfast, eh?
OK. The boss, he's a-saving some a-nice bones for you.
Breakfast comin' up from a-left field.
[chuckles] Good catch!
[man whistling]
[man] Whoa, boy, whoa.
[whistling continues]
[man humming]
Hey. Psst. Psst.
Blimey.
- Look, Peg, it's the Tramp.
- [Tramp] Shh.
Hiya, handsome.
Come to join the party?
All right. No time for wisecracks.
I've got to get you out.
I'm telling you, the pressure's on.
Signs all over town.
- Gee, thanks.
- You're a bit of all right, chum.
- OK, OK, get going.
- [man] Hey! What's going on there?
Scram. And be careful.
- [snarling]
- Why, you mangy mutt.
Hey. Let go. Let go of me.
Well. Snob hill. Ha!
Hi, gals. How's pickings?
Pretty slim, eh?
Yeah. I'll bet they've got a lid on every trash can.
Uh-oh. And a fence around every tree.
[chuckles] I wonder what the leash and collar set does for excitement.
Lassie. Lassie!
Oh, Miss Lady, ma'am.
Miss Lady!
[Jock] Ah! Good morning, lassie.
'Tis a bonnie, braw, bright day. Uh...
...day.
Why, Miss Lady.
Is something wrong?
Aye. Tell us, lassie.
- If somebody's been mistreatin' ya...
- Oh, no, Jock.
It's something I've done, I guess.
You?
It must be.
- Jim Dear and Darling are acting so...
- [Darling humming]
[humming continues]
- Jim Dear and Darling?
- Hush, lad.
Now, lassie, get on with the details.
Well, I first noticed it the other day when Jim Dear came home.
[clock chiming]
[barking]
Down, Lady, down!
Darling, darling!
Are you all right?
[Darling] Of course I am.
Why shouldn't I be?
[Jim] I just can't help worrying.
After all, in your condition, alone here all day, and walking that dog...
- That dog!
- That dog?
He's never called me that before.
Well, now, lassie,
I wouldn't worry my wee head about that.
Remember, they're only humans, after all.
That's right, Miss Lady.
As my grandpappy,
Old Reliable, used to say...
I don't recollect if I've ever mentioned Old Reliable before.
Aye, you have, laddie.
- Frequently.
- Oh, yeah.
But now Darling is... Well...
We've always enjoyed our afternoon romp together.
But yesterday...
[chiming]
[barking]
[humming]
[whining]
No, Lady. No walk today.
[humming continues]
[barking]
No, Lady.
Not now.
Lady!
Drop that, Lady.
Drop it, I say.
It didn't hurt, really.
But Darling has never struck me... before.
[chuckling] Now, lassie.
Do not take it too seriously.
After all, at a time like this...
Why, yes, you see, Miss Lady, there comes a time in the life of all humans when, uh...
Well, as they put it, uh...
Birds and the bees?
Or... Well, uh...
The stork. You know. Uh, no?
- Well, uh...
- What he's trying to say, lassie, is Darling is expecting a wee bairn.
Bairn?
He means a baby, Miss Lady.
Oh.
What's a baby?
[Jock] Well, they resemble humans.
[Trusty] But I'd say a mite smaller.
[Jock] Aye. And they walk on all fours.
[Trusty] And if I remember correctly, they bellow a lot.
Aye. And they're very expensive.
You will not be permitted to play with it.
But they're mighty sweet.
And very, very soft.
Just a cute little bundle. [chuckles]
[Tramp] Of trouble.
Yeah. They scratch, pinch, pull ears...
Aw, but shucks.
Any dog can take that.
It's what they do to your happy home.
Move it over, will you, friend?
Homewreckers, that's what they are.
Look here, laddie.
Who are you to barge in?
The voice of experience, buster.
[chuckles] Just wait till junior gets here.
You get the urge for a nice comfortable scratch, and, "Put that dog out!"
He'll get fleas all over the baby."
You start barking at some strange mutt.
[barks]
"Stop that racket.
You'll wake the baby."
And then!
Then they hit you in the room and board department.
Remember those nice, juicy cuts of beef?
[Tramp] Forget them.
Leftover baby food.
And that nice, warm bed by the fire?
[chuckles]
[thunderclap]
A leaky doghouse.
- Oh, dear.
- Do not listen, lassie.
No human is that cruel.
Of course not, Miss Lady.
Why, everybody knows a dog's best friend is his human.
[Tramp laughing]
Oh, come on now, fellas.
You haven't fallen for that old line, now have you?
Aye. And we've no need for mongrels and their radical ideas.
Off with you, now. Off with you!
- OK, Sandy.
- The name's Jock.
- OK, Jock.
- Heather Lad of Glencairn to you!
OK, OK, OK.
But remember this, Pigeon.
A human heart has only so much room for love and affection.
When a baby moves in, the dog moves out.
[Jim] Uh-huh.
Oh, let's see. That'll be about...
Oh, well.
[pounding]
[Jim] Darling?
There isn't any way we can tell for sure what it's going to be, is there?
[Darling] I'm afraid not.
Nobody ever knows for certain.
All we can do is hope.
[chiming]
[footsteps]
[yawning]
[wind howling]
[door closes]
Darling, are you sure you want watermelon?
[Darling] Mm-hmm.
Oh, and some chop suey too.
Chop su...
[sighs] Oh, all right, darling.
[door shuts]
[women giggling and chattering]
[woman 1]... the cutest thing.
- [woman 2] Those booties!
- [woman 3] That bonnet.
- [woman 4] Adorable.
- [woman 5] Don't you love showers?
[woman 6] I've never seen you more beautiful.
[woman 7] Isn't she radiant?
[woman 8] That's just what I told Bill.
"Bill", I said, "Darling looks positively radiant."
In all my days,
"I've never seen anyone as radiant."
[men laughing]
[man 1] Aw, Jim, you look terrible.
[man 2] Absolutely horrible.
[man 3] I never saw you look worse.
[man 4] Cheer up, Jim. Old Doc Jones has never lost a father yet.
[laughter]
[thunderclap]
[Jim] Yes, Aunt Sarah, it's a boy.
Uh-huh, a boy. And...
What's that?
Eyes?
Oh, what colour are they?
Well... Oh, gosh. l-I forgot to look.
A boy. It's a boy, it's a... Doctor!
Doctor, it's a boy!
Yes, yes, I know.
Uh-huh, a boy.
Oh, boy, oh, boy!
It's a boy, it's a boy, it's a boy!
[Aunt Sarah on phone]
Hello? Hello, Jim?
Are you there, Jim?
Central, we've been cut off.
Hello? Hello?
Hello!
[baby crying]
[crying continues]
[thinking] What is a baby?
I just can't understand
It must be something wonderful
It must be something grand
Cos everybody's smiling
In a kind and wistful way
And they haven't even noticed
That I am around today
[Jim whistling]
[thinking] What is a baby, anyway?
[baby crying]
Oh, what is a baby?
I must find out today
What makes Jim Dear and Darling
Act this way?
[baby cooing]
[Darling humming]
Oh, my little star sweeper
I'll sweep the stardust
For you
[humming]
Little soft, fluffy sleeper
Here comes a pink cloud
For you
[humming]
Little wandering angel
Fold up your wings
Close your eyes
[humming]
And may love be your keeper
[humming]
There, now.
Little star sweeper.
Dream on.
Well, that should do it.
We've got enough here to take us halfway to China.
[grunting]
[Jim] Darling. Darling!
We haven't much time.
[Darling] Jim, I just can't leave him.
He's still so small and helpless.
[Jim] He'll be all right.
Now come on. If he wakes up we'll never get away.
Jim, I feel so guilty deserting him like this.
[Jim] Nonsense.
[Jim] Hey.
What's the matter with Lady?
[Darling] She thinks we're running out on him.
[Jim] Oh, don't worry, old girl.
We'll be back in a few days.
[Darling] And Aunt Sarah will be here.
- [Jim] With you here to help her...
- [doorbell rings]
[Jim] There's the old girl now.
Coming, Aunt Sarah. Coming!
[Sarah panting] Sorry I'm late, dears.
Hope I haven't kept you waiting.
- [Jim] Let me take your things.
- No, no.
No fussing. I know my way around.
On your way, now.
Mustn't miss your train.
Have a good time, and don't worry about a thing.
Goodbye, dears. Goodbye, goodbye.
[Jim and Darling] Goodbye.
[Sarah] Now to see that big nephew of mine.
- Cootchie-cootchie-coo.
- [cooing]
Oh, you adorable little...
[gasps] Good gracious!
What are you doing here?
Go on, now. Shoo, shoo.
Scat. Get out of here.
- [baby crying]
- Aw, there, there.
Aunt Sarah won't let that dog frighten you anymore.
No, no, no.
[baby crying]
[Sarah] Rock-a-bye, baby
on the treetop
When the wind blows
We are Siamese
if you please
[purring]
We are Siamese
if you don't please
Now we looking over
our new domicile
If we like we stay
for maybe quite a while
[barking]
Do you seeing that thing swimming round and round?
Yesss.
Maybe we can reaching in and make it drown.
If we sneaking up upon it carefully...
There will be a head
for you, a tail for me
[crashing]
[baby crying]
Do you hear what I hear?
[purrs] A baby cry.
Where we're finding baby
there are milk nearby
If we look in baby buggy
there could be
Plenty milk for you
and also some for me
[growling]
- [screeching]
- [barking]
[Sarah] What's going on down there?
[gasps] Merciful heavens! My darlings.
- My precious pets.
- [yowling]
Oh. Ooh, that wicked animal.
Attacking my poor, innocent little angels.
[man] Good afternoon, ma'am.
What can I do for you?
I want a muzzle.
A good, strong muzzle.
Oh, yes, ma'am.
Now here's our latest.
Combination leash and muzzle.
Now, we'll just slip it on like this, and... No! No, no, no.
Nice doggy. No, don't wiggle.
Steady, now.
Now... Now, now.
Careful, you little...
[Sarah] Watch out.
- [man] Careful, doggy.
- [Sarah] Come back!
Get over here, I say.
Come back here.
[horn beeping]
[horn beeping]
[streetcar bell ringing]
[barking]
[snarling]
[growling]
[whimpering]
[panting, snorts]
Hey, Pige, what are you doing on this side of the tracks?
I thought you...
Wh?
Aw, you poor kid.
Oh, we've got to get this off.
Hmm.
I think I know the very place.
Come on.
Well, here we are.
- The zoo?
- Sure.
No, no. This way.
Follow me.
[guard humming]
- [Lady] Oh.
- What's the matter, Pige?
- We can't go in.
- Why not?
- [Lady] The sign says...
- [Tramp] Yeah, well, that's...
- That's the angle.
- Angle?
Look. We'll just wait for the right...
Uh-oh. Here we are now.
Just lay low.
[whistling]
[barking]
- [guard] Hey, you!
- I beg your pardon.
- Were you addressing?
- What's the matter? Can't you read?
Why, yes, in several languages.
Oh, a wise guy, eh?
All right, now, what's this creature doing here?
- He's not my dog.
- Oh, he's not, eh?
Go away. Get down.
Go on. Why, certainly not, officer.
I suppose you'll be tellin' me next it was the dog that was whistling, eh?
- [man] I'm certain I don't know.
- Oh! So I'm a liar now, am I?
Well, you listen to me.
A-ha! Resisting an officer of the law.
You're gonna pay.
Ow!
Pull a knife on me, will you?
Trying to assassinate me, you are.
Carrying concealed weapons.
[arguing continues]
Come on, Pige.
The place is ours.
[arguing continues]
We better go through this place from A to Z.
Apes.
No, no. No use even asking them.
They wouldn't understand.
They wouldn't?
Uh-uh. Too closely related to humans.
Uh-oh.
[Tramp] Alligators.
Now there's an idea.
Say, Al, do you suppose you could nip this contraption off for us?
[echoing] Glad to oblige.
Whoa. Whoa!
[hysterical laughter]
Ha! If anybody ever needed a muzzle, it's him.
- [animal] Timber!
- Pigeon, look out!
Now what harebrained idiot would...
Hey, look. A beaver.
There's the answer to our problem.
Let me see here.
Six-foot-six and seven-sixteenth inches.
Pardon me, friend.
- I wonder if you'd do us a little...
- Busy, sonny. Busy.
Can't stop to gossip now.
Got to slide this sycamore to the... [straining]
...swamp.
Well, this will only take a second.
Only a second? Listen, sonny.
Do you realise every second,
70 centimetres of water is wasted over that spillway?
- [Tramp] Yeah, but...
- Gotta get this log movin', sonny.
Gotta get it moving.
Think the cuttin' takes the time?
It's the doggone haulin'.
[straining]
[Tramp] The haulin'. Exactly.
- Now, what you need...
- I'd better bisect this section here.
What you need is a log puller.
[shouting] I said a log puller!
I ain't deaf, sonny.
There's no need to...
Did you say log puller?
And by a lucky coincidence you see before you, modelled by the lovely little lady, the new, improved, patented, handy dandy, never-fail little giant log puller.
The busy beaver's friend.
You don't say?
Guaranteed not to wear, tear, rip or ravel.
Turn around and show the customer the merchandise.
And it cuts log-hauling time 66 per cent.
Sixty-six per cent, eh?
[giggles] Think of that.
- Well, how's it work?
- Why, it's no work at all.
You merely slip this ring over the limb like this, and haul it off.
Uh, say...
You mind if I slip it on for size?
Help yourself, friend.
OK. Don't mind if I do.
How do you get the consarned thing off, sonny?
Glad you brought that up, friend.
To remove it, simply place the strap between your teeth...
Like this?
Correct, friend. Now bite hard.
You see?
It's off.
Say, that is simple.
Well, friend, we'll be on our way now, so...
Uh-uh. Not so fast now, sonny...
I'll have to make certain it's satisfactory before we settle on a price.
Oh, no, it's all yours, friend.
You can keep it.
I can, eh?
I can?
Uh-huh. It's a free sample.
Well, thanks a lot.
[chuckles] Thanks ever so...
Say!
It works swell.
[Lady] But when she put that horrible muzzle on me...
Say no more. I get the whole picture.
Aunts. Cats. Muzzles.
Well, that's what comes of tying yourself down to one family.
Haven't you a family?
One for every day of the week.
The point is, none of them have me.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
It's simple.
You see... [sniffing]
Hey. [sniffing]
Something tells me it's suppertime.
Come on. I'll show you what I mean.
Now take the Schultzes here.
Little Fritzie, that's me, Pige, makes this his Monday home.
- Monday home?
- Ach, ja.
[with German accent]
Monday is Mama Schultz cooking der Wiener Schnitzel.
Mmm.
Delicious.
[Irish accent] O'Brien's is where little Mike, that's me again, Pige,
- comes every Tuesday.
- Every Tuesday?
Begorra. And that's when they're havin' their darlin' corned beef.
You see, Pige, when you're footloose and collar-free, well, you take nothing but the best.
- [singing in Italian]
- Hey!
Tony's!
Of course.
The very place for a very special occasion.
This way, Pige.
I have my own private entrance.
Wait here.
Just one minute. I'm a-comin'. I'm...
What's a-matter? Somebody's a-makin' da April Fool with...
[barking]
Oh, hello, Butch.
Where you been so long?
Hey, Joe, look who's here.
Well, what do you know? It's Butch.
Hey, hey, hey!
Joe, bring some bones for Butchy before he eat me up.
- [chuckling]
- OK, Tony. OK.
Bones a-coming up.
[barking]
Huh?
Ahh!
What's this?
Hey, Joe, look.
Butchy, he's got a new girlfriend.
Well, a son of a gun!
He's a got a cockerel Spanish a-girl.
Hey, she's a pretty sweet kiddo, Butch.
You take-a Tony's advice and a-settle down with this-a one, eh?
"This a-one"?
This one. This... Oh!
Tony, you know.
He's a-not a-speaking
English a-pretty good.
[chuckles, clears throat]
Now, first we fix-a the table.
- Here's your bones, Tony.
- OK, bones. Bones?
[Tony] What's the matter with you,
Joe? I break-a your face.
Tonight, Butch, he gets the best in the house.
[Joe] OK, Tony, you're the boss.
Now, tell me, what's your pleasure?
A la carte? Dinner?
[barking]
A-ha. OK.
Hey, Joe.
Butch-a, he says he wants-a two spaghetti speciale.
Heavy on the meats-a ball.
Tony, dogs don't talk.
- He's a-talkin' to me!
- OK, he's a-talkin' to you.
You the boss.
Mamma mia. [grumbling in Italian]
Now here you are.
The best spaghetti in town.
[slurping]
For this is the night
It's a beautiful night
And we call it
Bella notte
Look at the skies
They have stars in their eyes
On this lovely bella notte
Side by side
With your loved one
You'll find enchantment here
The night will weave its magic spell
When the one you love is near
For
[both] This is the night
And the heavens are right
On this lovely
Bella notte
[chorus] This is the night
It's a beautiful night
And we call it
Bella notte
Look at the skies
They have stars in their eyes
On this lovely
Bella notte
Side by side with your loved one
You'll find enchantment here
The night will weave its magic spell
When the one you love is near
For this is the night
And the heavens are right
On this lovely
Bella notte
[rooster crowing]
Oh! Oh, dear.
Is something wrong, Pige?
- It's morning.
- Yeah. [stretches]
So it is.
I should have been home hours ago.
Why? Because you still believe in that,
"in the faithful old dog tray" routine?
Aw, come on, Pige.
Open up your eyes.
Open my eyes?
To what a dog's life can really be.
I'll show you what I mean.
Look down there.
Tell me what you see.
Well, I see nice homes with yards and fences.
Exactly. Life on a leash.
Look again, Pige.
[Tramp] There's a great big hunk of world down there with no fence around it.
Where two dogs can find adventure and excitement.
And beyond those distant hills, who knows what wonderful experiences?
And it's all ours for the taking, Pige.
It's all ours.
It sounds wonderful.
But?
But who'd watch over the baby?
You win.
Come on.
I'll take you home.
[man whistling]
[humming]
It's a beautiful night
And they call it...
[chickens clucking]
[Tramp] Not to change the subject, but...
Ever chased chickens?
I should say not!
Oh, ho! Then you've never lived.
- But we shouldn't.
- I know.
That's what makes it fun.
Aw, come on, kid.
Start building some memories.
But we... We won't hurt the chickens?
Hurt 'em? No!
[Tramp] We'll just stir 'em up a bit.
[Tramp] Just look at those fat, lazy biddies.
Why, they should've been up hours ago.
[barking]
[squawking]
Some fun, eh, kid?
[man] Hey, what's going on in there?
- [gunshot]
- What's that?
That's the signal to get going. Come on.
[gunshots]
- This is living, eh, kid?
- Is it?
Come on, Pige. Follow me.
You know, there's a little bit of bird dog in all of us, eh, Pige?
Pige? Pige?
Pige? Where are you, Pige?
Pige?
[echoing] Pigeon?
Oh, Pige!
[dogs howling and barking]
[howling mournful tune]
[howling continues]
[whimpering]
[dog] Hey.
Hey, Dachsie, how we coming?
Just one more chorus and we're out.
OK. On a downbeat.
- One, two...
- [clanking]
[man] Put her in number four, Bill,
- while I check her license.
- OK.
[Bill] All right, baby, in here.
Well, look yous guys,
Miss Park Avenue herself.
[chuckles] Blimey.
A regular bloomin' debutante.
Yeah. And pipe the crown jewel she's wearin'.
Hey, whatcha in for, sweetheart?
Putting fleas on the butler?
All right, you guys. Lay off, will you?
Aw, what's the matter, Peg?
We was only havin' a bit of sport, we was.
Can't you see the poor kid's scared enough already?
Pay no attention, my little ochi chernye.
That's right, dearie.
They don't mean no real harm.
It's like Gorky says in Lower Depths, quote:
"Miserable being must find more miserable being.
Then he's happy."
- Unquote.
- Boris is a philosopher.
Besides, little bublichki, wearing license here, that is like waving, you should excuse the expression, red flag in front of bull.
My license?
But what's wrong with it?
There ain't nothin' wrong with it, dearie.
Confidential, there's not one dog here who would not give left hind leg for such a knick-knack.
That's your passport to freedom, honey.
- Without it...
- [clanking]
Hey. Hey, yous guys, look.
Poor Nutsy is takin' the long walk.
[Lady] Where is he taking him?
[dog] Through the one-way door, sister.
[door locking]
You... You mean he's...
Oh, well.
A short life and a merry one.
Yeah, that's what the Tramp always says.
- The Tramp?
- Now there's a bloke what never gets caught.
He's given the slip to every dogcatcher in this burg.
You won't believe this, dearie, but no matter how tight a jam he's in, that Tramp always finds some way out.
I can quite easily believe that.
Ah, but remember, my friends, even Tramp has his Achilles heel.
Pardon me, amigo.
What is this "chilli heel"?
Achilles heel, Pedro.
This is meaning his, uh, weaknesses.
Oh. Oh, the dames. Yeah.
[chuckles] He has an eye for a well-turned paw, he has.
Let's see. There's been Lulu.
[dog] Yeah, and Trixie.
[Dachsie] Und Fifi.
And my sister,
Rosita Chiquita Juanita Chihuahua.
I think.
What a dog.
Yeah. Tell us about it, Peg.
What a dog!
Peg used to be in the Dog and Pony Follies.
He's a tramp
But they love him
Breaks a new heart every day
He's a tramp
They adore him
And I only hope he'll stay that way
- He's a tramp
- [howling]
He's a scoundrel
- He's a rounder
- [whimpering]
He's a cad
He's a tramp
But I love him
Yes, even I have got it pretty bad
- [howling]
- You can never tell
When he'll show up
He gives you plenty of trouble
I guess he's just a no-count pup
But I wish that he were double
- He's a tramp
- Bum-bum-bum-ruff
- He's a rover
- Bum-bum-bum-ruff
And there's nothin' more to say
Bum-bum-bum-ruff
[Peg] If he's a tramp
He's a good one
And I wish that
I could travel his way
Wish that I could travel his way
Wish that I could travel his way
Yeah.
But he never takes them serious.
Ah, but someday he is meeting someone different.
[Boris] Some delicate, fragile creature who's giving him a wish to shelter and protect.
Like Miss Park Avenue here, eh, matey?
Mm-hmm. Could be.
- But when he does...
- Yeah. I'm way ahead of ya.
Under the spell of true love...
The poor chump grows careless...
The Cossacks are picking him up...
And it's curtains for the Tramp.
[door opens]
[man] It's the little cocker, Bill.
- In number four.
- [Bill] OK.
All right, baby.
They've come to take you home.
You're too nice a girl to be in this place.
Courage, man.
Courage!
But, uh...
I've never even considered matrimony.
Nor I.
But no matter which of us she accepts, we'll always be the best of friends.
Now remember, not a word about her unfortunate experience.
- We don't want to hurt her feelings.
- Uh, yeah. Yeah.
Lassie.
Miss Lady, ma'am.
Please, I don't want to see anybody.
Now, now, lassie.
Don't feel that way about it.
Of course not, Miss Lady.
Why, some of the finest people
I ever tracked down
- were jailbirds.
- [Jock] Quiet!
You great loony!
Uh, please, lassie.
We've come with a proposition.
[Jock] For helpin' ya.
Help me? What do you mean?
Well, now...
You see, lassie...
Neither of us is as young as we used to be.
But we're still in the prime of life.
Aye.
And we've both got very comfortable homes.
[Trusty] That's right. Where we know you'll be welcome and appreciated, Miss Lady.
So... So, to come directly to the point...
[clears throat]
If you could, uh, find it possible to, uh...
To, uh...
You're both very kind, and I do appreciate it.
- But...
- [Tramp] Oh, Pigeon.
Oh, Pi...
[Tramp] Oh! Oh, hi, boys.
Anything new in the kennel club set?
[chuckling]
A little something
I picked up for you, Pige.
Hmpf.
Looks like I'm the one that's in the doghouse.
If this person is annoying you, Miss Lady...
We'll gladly throw the rascal out.
That won't be necessary. Thank you.
Very well, ma'am.
You... You...
...mongrel!
Aw, come on, Pige.
- It wasn't my fault.
- Hmpf.
I thought you were right behind me. Honest.
When I heard they'd taken you to the pound...
Don't even mention that horrible place.
[sobbing] I was so embarrassed and...
- And frightened.
- Oh, now, now.
Who could ever harm a cute little trick like you?
[Lady] Trick? Trick!
- That reminds me, who is Trixie?
- Trixie?
And Lulu and Fifi and Rosita Chiquita wh...
- Whatever her name is.
- Chiquita...
Oh! Yes! Well, l-I...
As far as I'm concerned, you needn't worry about your old heel.
[stammering] My heel?
I don't need you to shelter and protect me.
- But...
- If you grow careless, don't blame me.
I don't care if the Cossacks do pick you up! Goodbye.
- And take this with you.
- [thunderclap]
[Lady sobbing]
[board banging]
[thunderclap]
[growling]
[barking]
[barking]
Stop that.
Hush, now, hush.
[barking continues]
[Sarah] Stop that racket!
[Tramp] What's wrong?
- A rat!
- Where?
Upstairs, in the baby's room!
- How do I get in?
- The little door.
On the porch.
[thunderclap]
[sniffing]
[growling]
[snarling]
[barking]
[squeaking]
[squeaking]
[baby crying]
- [crashing]
- [squeaking]
[crying continues]
[gasping] Merciful heavens!
Oh! Oh, you poor little darling.
No, no, no.
Thank goodness you're not hurt.
You... You vicious brutes. Back!
Get back!
Go on! Get back!
The pound. The pound, that's it.
I'll call the pound.
[barking]
Come here, you. Come here!
Come on, come on.
Come along.
I'll call them this minute.
[whimpering]
I won't sleep with that brute in the house.
[barking]
[telephone ringing]
[Sarah] Hello? Hello!
[whimpering]
I don't care if you are alone there, young man.
I insist you pick him up immediately.
[bell rings]
[Jim] Darling, look.
[Sarah] If you want my advice you'll destroy that animal at once.
[man] Don't worry, ma'am.
We've been after this one for months.
We'll take care of him.
- [Darling] What do you suppose?
- [Jim] What's going on here?
[man] Just picking up a stray, mister.
Come on, giddup. [whip cracks]
Caught him attacking a baby.
- [Jim] Heavens.
- My baby.
[both] Aunt Sarah!
[Darling] Aunt Sarah!
[both] Aunt Sarah!
I was certain he was no good the moment I first laid eyes on him.
Yeah, but, uh...
I never thought he'd do a thing like that.
[Sarah] I got there in time.
There they were...
[Jim] I'm sure there must be some mistake. Lady wouldn't...
[barking]
[Sarah] Watch out! That dog's loose.
Keep her away.
[Jim] Nonsense.
She's trying to tell us something.
- [barking continues]
- What is it, old girl?
What are you try...
Darling, Aunt Sarah, come here.
- [Darling] What is it?
- [Sarah gasps]
[Sarah] Aaah! A rat!
A rat?
We should've known.
I misjudged him.
Badly.
Come on. We got to stop that wagon.
But man, we don't know which way they've gone.
We'll track 'em down.
And then?
We'll hold 'em.
Hold 'em at bay.
Now what?
The scent. Follow the scent.
Ach. Let's face it, man.
We both know you've lost your sense of smell.
[howling]
[howling continues]
[howling]
[howling]
- [man] Get out of here.
- [barking]
Go on, get away.
[barking]
Easy. Go on, get away.
Watch it now. Watch it!
[horn honking]
[crowd murmuring]
Hi, Pige.
[whimpering]
[howling]
[Jim] All right, everybody, watch the birdy.
[growling]
- [squeaking]
- Steady, now.
[Jim] Hold it.
[coughing]
I guess I used a little too much.
Uh-oh.
Darling, visitors.
Visitors?
[Darling] Why, it's Jock.
[Jim] And good old Trusty.
Careful now, man.
Careful. It's a wee bit slippery.
[Trusty] Yes, it is.
[Jim] All right, boy. We'll let 'em in.
No, no, not you, young man.
You're going to take a nap.
Well, Merry Christmas.
Come in, come in.
If you'll just step into the parlour
[Jim] I'll see about refreshments.
Oh, darling, where did you put the dog biscuits?
The box Aunt Sarah sent for Christmas.
[Darling] In the kitchen, Jim dear.
Oh, no doubt about it.
They've got their mother's eyes.
Aye. [chuckles]
But there's a bit of their father in them too.
Well, and I see you finally acquired a collar.
Oh. Yes.
Complete with license.
Oh, yeah, a new collar.
Caught the scent the moment
I came in the house.
[Trusty] Trusty, I says,
Trusty, somebody's wearing a new collar.
'Course, my sense of smell is very highly developed.
Runs in the family, you know.
There'll be no livin' with him from now on.
As my grandpappy,
Old Reliable, used to say...
I don't recollect if I've ever mentioned Old Reliable before.
[all] No, you haven't, Uncle Trusty.
Huh?
I haven't?
Well, um...
As Old Reliable used to say...
He'd say, uh...
He'd say... uh...
Uh...
Hmm.
Doggone.
You know,
I clean forgot what it was he used to say.
[chuckling]
[chorus] Peace, my children
Of good will
Peace, my children
Peace
Be
Still

THE CARD
Subtitles by Seglora
The five towns lie close to the heart of dear old England
They spread across the face of the countryside for many miles
Foul,unique and indispensable
Do you drink from a cup?
Do you eat from a plate?
You have the five towns to thank for that
The five towns stand for progress and civilization
When our story begins,Bursley was the largest of the five and it was also the proudest
Admittedly its atmosphere was inclined to be heavy
 but some remarkable people breath it
Among them was a widow Mrs Machin
she was a washer woman and there was Edward Henry Machin,her son
Denry as his mother called
him was a healthy child but it soon become apparent no ordinary one
As a boy he was a peculiarly
 thoughtful turn of mind
Instead of spending his leisure hours playing in the streets with his friends
He devoted extra time to the class room
He was not really dishonest it was just he liked to give providence a helping hand
Any case he soon had to pay the penalty for his crime
He won a scholarship to a school
of the sons of gentlemen and you know what the sons of gentlemen are
Washerwoman.washerwoman,washerwoman
It was early born upon Denry that the road to success is fraught with hardship
When the time came for him to leave school and make his way in the world of men
Denry received early confirmation of the fact that even in that world honestly is undoubtedly the
 best and most useful policy
-Yes
-I want to see Mr Duncalf,please Sir
Business?
I want to apply for the job advertised in the Centre North
You won't do
You can't read,it says apply by letter and enclosing references
I've noticed it but you see I brought my references with me
This does belong to Mr Duncalf,doesn't it?

Yes Mr Duncalf,Sir
I reckon she is the finest woman that  ever came to this town and that's a fact
-Denry
-Yes,mother
You'll be late again
I've been working late and
 I didn't sleep well
Actually you're sleeping too well
I've actually got something on my mind
You better have a dose of castor oil
Good Morning Mrs Machin.Morning Denry

E.H.Machin Esq

The Countess of Chell

I hope you have to make your excuses
-Evening dress is essential
-Evening dress
Thank you very much Mr Barlow I'll have
 the final setting ready for you on Tuesday
All right

Very glad you told me.Mr Shillitoe
-Good Bye
-Good Day Sir,Thank you
Hello,Denry,what can I do for you
I want a dress to
-Do you know?
-Yes
Sorry it can't be done
The ball you see,all the bigwigs
 in the town want a dress
I got to get through all the orders as it is
-But I'm going,do you see
-Going where?
To the ball
Duncalf's clerk going to the ball
Yes.Are you?
I've no time for that sort of thing
Do you mean to say that the
 Countess sent an invitation to you?
That's right.I could get one
 for you if you like
The Countess is a client of ours and
 I'm in charge of the invitations
See?
Are you sure?
Of course I need a bit of credit
-A year?
-Two
This is one of the nicest piece of facecloth I've had in for a long time
I can give you a fit on Wednesday
No,no,no Miss Westham.You must try to look less like a chimpanzee and more,although I realize it is very
difficult for you,more like a young lady now,we'll try again,and,one and two..
Come now Mr Clayton I know your
partner feels like a sack of potatoes but there is no reason for holding her like one and for goodness sake will you open your
 eyes and look where you're going
All right we'll do it once more, and one and two..
Get off her feet you clumsy oaf
You both have as about as much
 idea of dancing as a pair of crocodiles
This is you fifteenth lesson and it
 might as well be your first
I shall double my fees to you both
-Good Afternoon
-Good Afternoon
-Miss Earp
-Yes?
I saw your notice and I thought
I just call in to see if I could..
You want to learn to dance?
Yes.I was on my way home as I was passing I thought I just inquire
And you found yourself in a lunatic asylum
-You know what I was doing Mr..?
-Machin
I was consoling myself,you see there
 are some who are natural dancers
And there are some who are not
And to those who are not one cannot
always say the things one wishes and not when they are here really
I understand
I thought you would
You now I should say would
 be a natural dancer
You have the points.
Yes it could be pleasure for a young lady to dance with you
Good
You like to start now? My fee is
2 guineas for a course of 18 lessons
-2 guineas I,..
-1 guinea for 9
But Miss Earp would you like an invitation
 to the Countess's ball?
 I can get you one you know.
I'm in charge of the invitation
Are you really Mr Machin,that
 would be extremely kind of you
I would so wishing I could go
And you of course will be going yourself,
I really think you should have
 the 2 guinea course
You can pay me next time you come
Right,we will start with the waltz
It's quite simple,ready
A right left,right left, right left,right left wake slightly forward one two
 three,one two three
Splendid,one two three,splendid two three one two three
Together,one two three, yes you are a natural dancer
Denry
What did you say
You'll be late again and that is not good manner as the Countess has invited you
I know
I promised the first dance to Ruth Earp
Ruth Earp? You see? Maybe you have but the dinner table is no place for your boots
Sorry
Blessed
I must be off
Your father never had one of those
-No
-Pride goes before a fall
That's right
Get away with you
Have you got your key?
-Good Evening Machin
-Hello Swetham
Will you care to step this way?
Good Evening,Good evening
Countess's cloth
-Hello John
-Hello again,nice to see you
How goes it?
Quite a temperate lady,she is, trouble with one of the horses
-So long
-Bye,bye
Miss Earp
What about our dance?
-Our dance has just finished
-Has it?
I'm terribly sorry
Miss Cotterill,Machin
How do you do
Didn't you look at your programme?
Programme
It's the usual thing to do
Where do I get a programme?
I shall ask the footman
One of those?
That's right
Nellie
Excuse me can I have the pleasure to have a dance with you?
I'm so sorry my programme is full
Excuse me,can I have the pleasure with a dance with you?
Thank you,I'm afraid my programme is full
-Excuse me can I have a....?
-Hi,dance with me
Look at old Mrs Whiggsey.
Do you see anything like her?
She looks like she has come out of a rag bag
I do not know what this town is coming to
Hello Machin
Countess hasn't danced yet
She won't either.Can't say I blame her with this lot
That's right
Nice woman.Mother was having
 tea with her the other day
Why don't someone of the old buffers
 standing around her ask her to
I suppose they can't dance
Somebody ought to ask her
You go and do it,it's a free country
I wouldn't for twopence
I'll bet you 5 £ you don't
I'll take you
Can I have this dance with you?
It's nearly over isn't it?
I'm sure that doesn't matter
Thank you.I should like to.
Machin
I hear you have some bit of troubles with your horses tonight
Yes we did.Who told you?
I just picked it up
-I have an idea I've seen you before Mr..
-Machin,I'm Duncalf's clerk
You were at the office
Yes of course I remember
-You dance very well Mr Machin
-Really?
As a matter of fact it's the first
 time I ever danced in my life
Except in the services you know
It is
She says is the same in dancing as in life it is a moral duty to adapt
 herself to the man
Does she? That's the most
 interesting thought
I soon picked it up,dancing I mean
You pick up things easily,don't you?
Yes
See you
Thank you Countess
Thank you Mr Machin I enjoyed that
Here you are.Mind your cheek
What was like to dance with?
Just the same as with any other woman
What was she laughing at?
Ladies and gentlemen take your
 partner for the lancers
Excuse me
Good Morning Good Morning Good Morning
Good Morning Good Morning Good Morning..
Why are you so gloom and
 gloomy.This fine Sunday
Machin
That's why,you will see when I got in, and I wasn't more than five minutes late
Machin
Come in
Who invited you to the Countess's Ball?
-Who,Sir?
-Yes.Who.Answer me
I did
You did
Yes I thought you perhaps had forgot to put my name on the list of the invitations
You did.Did you? I suppose you thought
 I forgot to put down that tailor chap too
Shillitoe the missed herb
What have you got to say for yourself
-Nothing
-Nothing
I suppose you fancy yourself dancing with your betters eh?
Yes.Don't you?
How dare you speak to me like that
I would never have employed you in the first place a washer woman's son
You haven't done an honest day
 work since you've been here
Nor ever likely to,well you can take
 a week notice,you understand
A week's notice
And clear up those documents and take them to the vault
Alas
It's no use I intend to wait
Ah,Mr Duncalf at last I found you in
I'm extremely sorry Mrs Codleyn but
 I'm very busy just for the moment
If you make an appointment with my clerk
I do not care to make an appointment
What I'm asking you to do when
I've taken the trouble to drive into town to see you is to listen
 to what I have to say
And actually remove your hat to do so
My dear Mrs Codleyn
I'm aware that I'm not your
most important client but the property you manage for me and the rent you collect on my behalf are not insignificant and surely entitle me
My dear Madame
Entitle me to elementary courtesy as I was
 about to say when you interrupted me
But I see that I was mistaken
Madam if you care to place your interest in other hands
I should only be too delighted to hand over all your papers
 and payments on my cost
And Good Morning to you
Mrs Codleyn
It is you Mr Machin.If Duncalf sent you to apologize you can save your breath
It's not that Mrs Codleyn, listen what I want to explain
Explain? I'm not used to be
 insulted,Mr Machin
I shall not think indeed
It's too cruel.Just look at our widows, nobody to protect me,to be spoken like that
Let me tell you this I take
 Mr Duncalf at his words
if there was somebody else I could trust but I don't understand anything
 about rent collectors
That's what I want to talk
 about,Mrs Codleyn
I collect your rent for you if you like
You?
You see I have given him my notice, the fact is that Duncalf I don't
 hit it off together
-But you're only a clerk
-And what's more I'll do it for 5 % instead of 7,5% and I settle accounts
 every month or week if you like
Instead of once a quarter like he does
Well I don't know that I.
5 % did you say?
The usual rent 6 months off the arrears.There you are
-Three more
Will you have to go just without your pint,wouldn't you?
If it's rent you want,not for you
Calm now Mrs Hullins that won't do
Here take a pinch of tobacco
I'm not going without a half
 a crown at any rate
You will be here for better
 part of some time then
I've told you about my son Jack, he's been out of work six weeks he starts today,he will let you have some of it
It won't do,mother,we can't have
 any more arrears,you know
The way you people go on, your ruining poor Mrs Codleyn
Six and forty years I've
 been lived in this heir house
And look what you owe
It's the bailiffs for you I'm afraid
Neigh,neigh,you will not turn me out
I'm sorry mother,it's the rent or
 the bailiffs,one or the other
Look I hate to see you turned
 out of your home
I'll lend you half a crown if you like
But I can't do it for nothing
You pay me back next week
 and give me a twopence
-You are a queer Mr Machin
-That's fair isn't it?
Now get your rent book
Twopence a week for half a crown that's 10 %,that's 40% per month and 500% over the year,you see mother
I've still got that 5 £ I won at the ball
5£ 10% per week compound interest, why that is a fortune
That's lots of them hard up to the rent it will be doing them a kindness
Supposing they won't pay you back
They'll have to,you see when
 they pay me the next rent
I won't mark it down in their books
 unless they are straight with me
Aren't you impressed?
Come on Joey
-You're Machin.
-That’s me
-My name is Calvert
-Oh yes
I've been hearing a lot about you
Get the rents in no nonsense, that's what old Mrs Codleyn tells me
Clears up the arrears 5%
 that is monthly right?
That's right
Here is a list of my tenants in the arrears,get that back log cleared up
I might have something more for you,right
-Right
-Good
I'll give you a week
What's the matter with him?
It's your stick
Thank you Ruth,Friday at eight?
Yes,Friday don't forget to practice your turns
I won't
-Good Afternoon,Mr Machin
-Good Afternoon,Nellie,Miss Cotterill
-I like your hat
-Thank you
-How do you do Miss Earp
-How do you do Mr Machin
-Can I come in a moment
-Please do
It's a long time since we seen anything of one and another,Mr Machin
Yes it is
Do sit down
Thank you
I've been called about the rent,Miss Earp
The rent?
Yes I collect rents,you know
Indeed I thought you were a gentleman
Mr Herbert Calvert has instructed me that no rent is to be allowed to
 be remain in arrears
Let's see you owe 30 £ plus
Mr Herbert Calvert,that what he has done
I presume you know what happened?
Happened?
Mr Calvert took advantage of his
visit here for his rent to behave in a very vulgar and offensive way
What did he do?
Insulted me
I've would have given him
notice to leave instantly if I haven't had to consider my pupils
As it was I decided to withhold the rent and I shall continue to do so
 until I receive an apology
It wouldn't be convenient then to pay something on account
Convenient? Everybody in this town knows that my clientele get larger every year
Convenient? It's perfectly convenient
I just don't care to
Is that final Miss Earp?
Absolutely
Then I think the simplest thing for me will be to send round the bailiffs
 tomorrow morning early
I see so I'm to be persecuted as well
No,the bailiff is quite a nice chap
What curious man you are Mr Machin
Very well I suppose I shall have to give in
I'll write you tonight
With the money? You could give it me
 now really,couldn't you?
Yes,I could and make you thoroughly ashamed of yourself
I shall give you some tea as well
-There is no need
-But there is
I insist
-More tea?
-No thank you
-Let me take your cup
-Thank you
-Cigarette?
-Thank you
The matches are inside
-Sure you don't mind?
-No,I like it
Do you smoke?
I like a man to smoke
I hear that you were a member
 of the Country Club now
Oh,yes
It means you are becoming a very important person
The bank manager put me up
As you know people are still talking about the way you danced with the Countess
If it hadn't been for you I hadn't been
 able to dance with her
I'm sure you are the sort of a man who
 could do anything if you wanted to
Ashtray?
I'm keeping you
No,no,I have a pupil coming in five minutes,that's all
Anyway you can't go before I paid you
-Well
-No.I insist
Every month I put your horrid Mr Calvert's rent in this box
It's all there
I see
Now you shall open it
Turn it sharply into the right
Not seems to open
It's a bit awkward.Let me.Now
It's broken I'm afraid
I'm so sorry
It's not your fault
Just that I don't see how we're
 going to get it opened
You mind calling in at Aldman it has to send somebody around forceps first thing in the morning
And then I can call in and give you the money
That's all right I can call
Can you?
Oh,yes
To tea?
A pupil
Tomorrow then?
Tomorrow
Is there anybody there?
Who is it?
It's me
Miss Earp
Yes.Is that Mr Machin?
Yes.What on earth are you doing in there
What did you say?
I said what on earth.Never mind
I'll try and get round to you
Where are you?
I'm in here.On the table
Just a moment I got some matches
Goodness
I hit my head.I think
 I may have fractured it
Can't you get me out?
I think we are too far from the bank
How deep is the water down there?
Not very
Then I'll come down
The men just put the table in and said it was time for supper and took the waltzed out and went
Furniture men are always like that
But how did you get here?
I was looking for a box to pet the china in
I see doing a moonlight flit
You've got a nerve
I don't need what you mean,
I was helping a friend
A friend? That's your table
 you are sitting on there
The same one which has a little box with a lock that doesn't work
I've looked surprised, a chump going up to an empty house for tea tomorrow,wouldn't I?
And all that talk about
Calvert insulting you well it's bailiffs for you this time Miss
 Earp and make no mistake about it
Bailiffs
I say it's not as bad as that,it isn't really
I did tryt o pay but it was no good
It was too much owing and so few people who wanted to dance
I wasn't extravagant you've got to have good clothes and things if you want the nice people to come
And it wouldn't be any good my
 selling it all up then I'd had nothing
Where were you going?
I was going to my father in Birmingham
I didn't know you had a father, why doesn't he help?
He's bankrupt again
Again?
He's been bankrupt four times
That's why I tried on my own
What is it going to become of me
You'll be all right
We better get out of here
That table was made of iron,isn't it?
Yes.Why?
The table is the only thing which will
 give you away,we will drop it out there
The water is deep enough,come on
-Oh Denry is it safe?
-You'll be safe with me
Oh Denry
Six,cracked note,little Miss Martin, and 10 £ from Miss Earp on account
 less commission of course
Well.What about the balance?
You'll get it
Lots of rumour about that van business the other night
She tried to hook it off being cute
No,no I think the van went to the wrong house
Funny how people talk,some say
 you are engaged to her
Oh,look there is the silly old Duncalf
 coming out of the shoe shop
And you are off to Llandudno‎ for a holiday
They may be right to that
And taking Nellie Cotterill along as a chaperon
I shouldn't be surprised
I like you Denry,you're getting into being a quite a card
Paying tenants rents for the month,everything,
I'll tell you what I do,you can look
 after the rest of my property if you like
Good.I will.When do I start? Next week?
You'll be away
I'll come back for a couple of days to collect the rent
All right.Here is the list
Thanks.Good Day
Good Day to you
Machin
Enjoy your self
I'm afraid Nellie feel a little
 hard with my daytime walk
It's a different landlady from
the one I had last year but she is very nice
Now where shall we begin
It's so much to do and we've
 got to do everything
I know the pier
That's so close I can see
the captain clearly so very becoming to man a beard
Denry why don't you grow a beard?
Oh,Denry our future,shall I go first?
You do want to know your
 fate,don't you Denry?
Come Nellie
Come on in,both.It's lovely
I don't think I can face it after all
I'll try again tomorrow
Very cheap to Snowdon,of course I went
 last year,but I'll love to go again
The isle of Man,magnificent, we must go first class
Look,Denry,marionettes
It's horrid but we'll have to go
Denry 6 shillings
Now this is something we mustn't miss
But Denry won't be here on Tuesday
What do you mean?
I've got to go to Bursley to collect the rent
That.But you will be back
in time for the concert in case you catch the seven o'clock train we'll meet you at the station
Llandudno station, All change.Please
Twenty minutes late.You know it's too bad
Pier it's quite close and it
 doesn't start until eight
Here he is
-Hello.Hello Nellie
-Good Evening Denry
You're late.We have to go straight there
I caught the first train I could,and even
 didn't have a chance to get to the bank
Let's say there is a little
 bit of wind isn't it?
The maid at our hotel said it was the
 worst storm they have had for 20 years
We couldn't even get on the
 promenade this afternoon
Then we went shopping instead
We'll have to call a cab
-Cab
-Cab
I told you no good standing there waiting
What's that?
What's all that about?
There is a Norwegian ship in trouble.
I'm afraid she won't make it to the pier
-Let's go and see
-You can't.The pier has been closed
Has it?
I tell you.You can't go on.
The pier is closed
You need a boat in here
I'll tell you.You can't go in there
Please leave it with me.Press.
Staffordshire Sentinel.I'll close the gate
That's the fishing boat they were talking about
You two wait in the shoulder.I'm going down
Here take this it's the rent
What do you want?
I'm from the Press.Is this your boat?
What's left of it.Keep her clear
Would you care to make a statement
What's there to say.Look the last mast of pieces going in the lifeboat one
If I were you,mister, I'll get out down here
All good reporters can take care of ourselves
Help,help
Now I've got no more pennies
Look instead of take some of these you
 go on the outside and I go on the inside
Here we are.Now let us spread
 our chocolates
-There we are
-Tusen tack(Norw.)
You don't look very well you must have some
Cocoa You like hot cocoa?
-And what about you?
-Ma jag betale for dette(Norw)
What a difficult language,still,never mind
That's all I'm afraid.But hold on.I'll be back
Denry.Denry
Where have you been?
We are running out of chocolates but there is butterscotch and coffee, have you any more pennies?
No,couldn't you use half crowns instead
No we tried they won't fit the machine
Nellie
-Good Morning Denry
-Good Morning
Where is Nellie?
I told her to meet us later
 in the pavilion
And how are you feeling?
Fine
No cold or anything?
No
Nellie and I got our bills for the room this morning
Did you?
-Yes
-Did you pay it?
Yes.The landlady said she
didn't give credit so Nellie gave me her share and I paid it
-Gosh
-Lovely
I've hardly any of the money left that you gave me
There was distress of course but you feel how dear money goes
No
One cannot run into debt here, they'll only claim your luggage
I think they would
I suppose we could use some of that?
Is there any left?
The Calvert will be pleased,it's so generous you know,but at cost you know
What exactly do you mean by that?
Nothing
One cannot make a remark like
 that and mean nothing
A chap can make any remark and mean nothing
Good Morning
Who's that?
It's a gentleman I was once engaged to
No.I suppose I shall just have to go
 home earlier that's all
Is it?
I think I shall go and find Nellie
It's you
Patching it up?
It's hardly worth it
It is not as bad as all that is it?
No,look at that
I see what you mean.Want to sell her?
I might
Want to buy it?
I might.Come and have a drink
But you said just now on the beach that
 she was not worth patching up
That was before I knew that you wanted to buy her
I'll tell you what I do.I'll give you 15 £ now 15£ when I collect her
 and 15£ at the end of the season.
And what's more I'll give you 5 £ a week
 to look after things
Now what do you say?
-All right.I'll do it.
-Have another drink
Now here are my bags and everything
Oh Nellie we must have something
 to read in the papers
-Good afternoon
-Good afternoon Madame
And this and this and that over there
How much?
-3 sh and 2 p
-3 sh and 2p Denry
She is getting some chocolates
Perhaps you prefer this one,Madame
It's got a beautiful ribbon
Isn't it a lovely box?
How much?
15 shillings Madame
That's quite reasonable
Who were they?
A young lady I was once engaged to
Which one?
Can't remember
15 shillings
I been wondered by one of these paper-weights before.Pure crystal
Have you got one with a picture
 of the Great Orme?
I'm afraid not,Madame.We got the Esplanade,
Happy Valley but we out of the Great Orme
Dear.Can't you get one and send it to me?
Yes Madame.We could do that.
They are 35 shillings each
I just make a note where to send it
What name?
Rockefeller
Buckingham Palace
Denry.What an awful thing to say
I only said Rockefeller,can't a chap say Rockefeller?
No he can't
You must apologize at once
Ruth.There is picture of Snowdon,
Dendry just didn't mean it
He is very sorry
I will not submit to insults
No of course not,Dendry
Your ring.Our engagement is at an end.
Ruth
I only said Rockefeller
Come along Ladies and Gentlemen,come along
Everybody taken the chance of the trip to the scene of the terrible
Hjalmar shipwreck
Everybody,man,woman and child will want
 this unique and educational experience
Only 2 and six pence for the round trip including the use of one of the original lifeboats if so desired the gallant Norwegian sailor men will roar
you to the scene of the terrible ordeal sailing every half hour of the day, children half price,babies are free
There you are Mr Machin.That's another 3 £
Thanks,Simeon
That's 60 £ in three  days
Seem to like it.Don't they?
Just as out of the Cregeen's old book
That's it
There is mighty lot of money for doing nothing.Mr Machin
But you see I did do something,
Simeon,I thought of it
-Hello Denry
-Hello mother
So you are back for good now are you?
Yes
And I brought you a little present
What's in it?
Lot of jolly fine pebbles I've
 been collecting on the beach
Pebbles?
Go on.Open it up
Must be more somewhere and
 I will look for them tomorrow
One thousand and fourteen pounds
And I sold the boat for what I paid for it
Then is all this really yours
No I told you it is yours
But what are we going to do with it?
For one thing you don't have to work anymore in that old wash-house
And why not?
Now listen..
I always worked for my living,and I'll go on working,thank you very much
-What's wrong with working?
-Nothing
It's your money and you can spend it or save it as you please
Or if you asked me I'd save it because
 you never know what can happen
By only last week I dropped half a crown down the drains outside
You can laugh,never does no harm to save
No it doesn't
But I've got a better idea
Do you see what I mean Mr Cregeen,people join the club and pay in so much a week
The third chapter decided
 on a 10 £ subscription
Larfy only paid 5 £ to me and he gets 10£ worth of gods from you on his card
I paying you
In fact you lend him 5 £
That's right and he pays me
 back week by week
That's take capital
Doesn't he pay you interest?
No he pays me 10 £ and gets 10 £ worth of gods from you or somebody else
And you do this just to help the working man
Oh,no.You give me 15% discount
Wait a minute
Because he can only use his club card at a shop which I nominated and the shop I nominate is the one
 that give me 15% discount,you see
I see you're quite a card yourself aren't you Mr Machin
All right.I'm on
But it is extra business for you Mr Bostock the club makes it easier for them to buy
You'll get customers you've never ever seen before isn't that worth 15%
How do I know I'll get my money from you
I'll open an account with you today,give you a deposit,right
All right Machin I'll give it a trial
 but I want 50£ deposit fee
50 £ deposit will rule me out
A deposit Machin and I'm in
Deposit,deposit,deposit,deposit...
I'd like to help you Denry but I'm afraid I can't
But the whole thing is a colossal success
I know if it weren't you won't be needing money
It's an old disease,Denry, you're undercapitalized
I know that that's why I came to the bank
I'll be frank,Denry,these people of mine at the head office all they see is a young chap without anything really solid behind him asking for a loan which they think twice about giving to an old established business house
They don't like that,you see, you're not respectable
I am not respectable?
From a banking point of view you are not
Now,if you had someone with a name
With a position to keep up a reputation
for probity to consider would lend that name to the club's activities as a patron say that would be different
-See?
-I see
Thanks
Someone respectable?
So you see John there is nothing in it
I'd like to oblige Denry but
I'll tell you what,you know those new kitchen rangers with brass knobs and everything
Yes
You do this for me
I'll get Mr Calvert to install one of those
 rangers in your mother's kitchen
Well I do not..
Brass knob now what you say?
Well it is bit..
All you got to do is to give me
 the thumps up sign as you pass
So that's settled.Isn't it?
Denry I..
Come on Joey
What is it?
It is a rear side trace ,
My Lady,it is broken
I will get out
-A trace you said?
-Yes,My Lady
I'll have it right a brazier shaped,My Lady
How long to have the brazier shaped?
About 20 minutes My Lady
-It's too long
-Yes,My Lady
Good Afternoon Countess.Had an accident?
No I'm doing this for idle amusement
Can I be of any assistance to you?
You know Mr Machin I 'd
 rather think you can
Things like the 5 £ Universal Club Card
 is something people need round here
It's makes it easier for them to buy the things they want
I see.You are very charitable Mr Machin
Oh no I'm just fond of make money
So I imagined
I don't see anything wrong with that,Countess,do you?
No.But I don't see myself as patron either I'm afraid Mr Machin
Well.Here we are just about to turn into
 the square in a couple of minutes in hand
Not bad for a mule
You're all right
I think we better walk don't you?
I hope you are not going to let this animal beat us Mr Machin
I'd think I hurt my arm a bit
Oh Then I'll better drive
Once it let it beat you, it will never forget it
Kindly back us out of here,please
Make way please
Thank you
Send the bills for any damage to me
Mr Machin has had his arm hurt,the doctor should be on his way
Very good My Lady
Are you all right Mr Machin when
 we know when the ceremony is over
I will drive you home with a better state of wheels
Well Ladies and Gentlemen I've
had my say about this tail of work and in concluding with my proposal
for the vote of thanks to the Countess of Chell for coming here in person to open it I should like to say in my official capacity as Superintendent of the Police that I don't know that I ought not to charge the Countess and Mr Machin here with driving to the common danger
Nevertheless all's well that
 ends well as they say
I know propose a vote of thanks and call upon it to be seconded
He has to be seconded
He has got to be seconded
You go to seconded
Me no.No you do it Duncalf
No,Calvert you think of it
I have nothing prepared.
Somebody has to do it
Shall I do it?
Ladies and gentlemen I've had the honor of being asked by the lady's committee to second the vote of thanks
to the Countess of Chell and I see that there are quite
a few of you this afternoon who are members of the five towns Universal Thrift Club
Btw you can't use your card this afternoon it's your cash they want
Cash on the nail
And why? Because it's for charity and a good charity at that the Bursley Cottage Hospital
In fact I think the best way we can thank the Countess for coming here this afternoon is to give it all the support we can
And just to show you that I mean what I say
I'm going to start the ball rolling by buying something
Now what's cheapest?
Well whatever it is I'll give 50 £ for it and I hand my cheque to your
 committee this afternoon
There it is,Ladies and Gentlemen, now move along please let's show the five towns that
 Bursley's heart in the right place
Good Bye Sir
Home coming
Shall I make the tea Mrs Machin?
Thank you Nellie
Is Denry taken you to the concert next week?
He did say something about it but since
 he became a Councilor he's been so busy
Councilor.Reckon he's getting
 above himself.
His father never wanted to become a Councilor
What do you think? I've heard
 from Ruth Earp yesterday
-She's married
-That's a blessing
Three months ago to a Birmingham man very rich,a bit old of course, she's very happy
Happy she is,very rich
-Good night,Howard
-Good night,Sir
-Hello Nellie
-Hello Denry
-Are you in bed?
-Doesn't look like it
-You know what the doctor said
-Ah,doctors
-What have you got there?
-Present for you.
It's your birthday tomorrow
Your birthday? And you never told me
I don't know the ones reminding of it
There
-Lovely
-Blessed
Put it on
Go on,Nellie,make her put it on
My,it's warm
It should be it's real sealskin
Don't take it off
What are you doing?
Put it away of course.I'll get some moth powder tomorrow
And listen mother,you know what the doctors said you got to keep warm,you know,wearing..
Never said I was
You'll never be in this rotten
 old place it is damp
This was reckon to be a very good class of
 house when your father and I came into it
Some folks have got so grand
Now listen mother.Do you know how much I'm making?
Over 2000£ a year.We don't
 have to go on living here,do we?
You can live where you like
 but I'm staying here
And that's final
I don't know
What are you laughing at?
You Denry,your mother must be the only person
 in the Five towns that's always
 get the better of you
That is your considered opinion
It is
Bless us
Denry
Now,what do you think of her,not bad is she?
-Is it yours?
-Yes,I got her 3 weeks ago
3 weeks ago,you always said you might get one
I wanted to surprise you and
 I had to learn to drive first
It's wonderful
I'll take you to a spin out after tea if you like,is your father in?
No,he had to go to Manchester on business
Money?
I think so
Not you worry anyway
What does the gigs belong to?
That's my surprise.Come on in.I'll show you
Look
By jove
Good Afternoon Denry
I'll say.What a surprise.How are you?
Don't tell me I can see how you
 are,you look wonderful
That's not the right thing to say
 to a widow in mourning,Denry
A widow?
I'm so sorry
I didn't know
Nellie has been telling me
 about your success
I expect she made too much of it
I expect she has
He's always so modest
He always was
-Nellie
-Yes mother
Tea is ready
I did very little shopping in Paris,
I didn't want to stay but I simply couldn't fit going back there again to that horrid Swiss
 hotel crammed full of tourists
Thank you
So I went to Monte Carlo instead
 it was very dear of course
Yes it must have been
But not as dear as Venice
That was gayer?
Naturally.Much.
I stayed with the Comtesse Martinario
 and her brother they have a nice palace
It used to be the Duke of Rodriguez's, of course they only keep about 
26 of their own servants
But it is very very comfortable and so much easier to run
 and after all we spent most
 of the time on the yacht
Denry do pass the cake to Lady Capron-Smith
Yes of course.To who?
Me
No thank you
It must very tame for you
 here back in England
No.I like England.After all it
is where one's real friends are and one dear say long for news
I'm afraid nothing much has happened here
Alderman Mould died
I'm afraid I don't..
He was going to Mayor in December
Now I suppose we should have to have Mr Duncalf
He is a horrible man and now he want to close down the football club just because it won't pay
Silly old Duncalf
Nellie I think that is your father back
Will you excuse me?
Ruth I nearly forgot.Denry has got a motor
Really?
-You drive well
-It's easy once you got the knack of it
-You've changed,you know
-Have I?
You are so much more self-assured mature
Changed a bit yourself?
What children we were
Do you remember Mr Calvert's rent?
Yes. Do you?
This is more comfortable than the furniture van
Of course if I got one I have
 to have a chauffeur
I didn't know that your husband had a title
What was it? A Lord?
No.Only a knight
I didn't even know he kicked the bucket..died
How did it happen?
We had only been married a little while,two months
It was very sudden.Heart
He overtaxed his strength
Of course he was quite elderly
 but most good and kind
He was in steel
Do you see very much of Nellie?
Quite a bit.I am very fond of Nellie
Yes.She is sweet
I am so glad we met again Denry
That silly little misunderstanding, you know,it haunted me
Has it?
Money.It is so important, when you haven't got it and now we both got plenty
 and it doesn't matter
The real thing is ambition isn't it?
How do you mean?
You want to be mayor,don't you?
You see I couldn't be the youngest
 mayor this town ever had
Could have been?
Next year there will be too late for that this year there is the silly old Duncalf
You do not want to upset him
-I don't mind about that but..
-But what?
I don't know
I don't know if I can do it
Denry.Don't you remember what I used to say to you?
What was that?
You can do anything,anything
 at all,if you want to enough
You are that kind of man
You really think so?
Yes
Well Mr Mayor it's yours again
Well I must admit
And this is the kind of show I am blamed for trying to put a stop to
Well the weather doesn't help
Don't make no difference
 what the weather is
Bursley's team is a joke
As long as long as we do not get any public support it will stay a joke
They have the impertinence to organize meetings to condemn the directors
The joke is over now.We are closing it down
It's a pity about Thursday's meeting though
We don't want the things
 become a political issue
Politics don't come into it it's simply a matter of the shareholders
 interest being protected
And I am going to say so
I'll get them a meeting
I'd like a word with your
 captain,Councilor Machin
You'd better come with me
There is only one thing wrong with football and it's not the football it's yourself
For thirteen years now me
and my co-directors have been losing money,our own money to provide this town with a
professional football team and we warned you again and again what would happen if these matches weren't better patronized and now when you stalked the proved debt
You call a meeting to complain about bad management
Hello Denry I thought you were in Birmingham
No
It's all very well to talk but it doesn't get you anywhere
Facts are the real talkers
How are you going to get new blood
 with transfer fees as high as they are
Would anybody at this meeting
 care to lend the club 1000 £ or so?
Anybody?
I thought not
What you're asking for is not better management but something for nothing
Mr Mayor,Mr Mayor
May I say a few words on this subject?
Step up on the platform,Councilor Machin
Thanks
I don't pretend to be an expert on football but I would like to say something
 about this question of new blood
If I'm not mistaken one of the greatest
 modern footballer is a native of this town
Callear
That's right
Callear is the man I mean
The greatest centre forward in England
Callear left this town when he was a boy and he's made the fortune in every club he has played for
Liverpool City
Your county
Your county
That's right and Birmingham
 he is the best there is
Gentlemen I say that Callear ought
 to come back to his native town
And Bursley's centre forward
he'll  lead us on to victory, all right,wouldn't he?
I'm glad Councilor Machin admits that
 he has no knowledge of football
That saves me the trouble of telling you
Why don't you sit down!
Trouble in using him that Aston Villa
and Blackburn Rovers have both made offers to 
Birmingham for Callear and now these two wealthy clubs
are fighting it out between them and ask Callear back again to Bursley,why, steam engines and that Cigg
 himself couldn't do it
Finished?
Mr Callear would you mind stepping up a moment,so we all can have a look at you
Well,gentlemen,we've got Mr Callear here without either the steam engine
 or His Majesty
I suggest to the Directors of the Club that they accept him and try another season
Wait a moment,wait a moment, what about the transfer?
I forgot I signed him up in Birmingham this morning as a present for the club
Please use applause for Machin
It won't be Councilor Machin for long now,Denry
Hello Mr Machin.We won,all right eh!
Have you seen the news of 
Councilor Cotterill,terrible thing
Bankrupt
Cotterill bankrupt!
Yes I know
A petition was filed in Manchester, that's hardly would have been able to keep it a secret for so long
Nellie herself didn't know it until the
 last week,she told me yesterday
Why didn't tell me,I'd have helped them
It wasn't just the money, it was talk of criminal procedures
Why didn't you tell me?
Let them go off like that
Nellie made me promise not to.
They didn't want to notify.
They were ashamed
Their relations in Canada sent
 them the money for the fare
It seemed easier for them to just
 go without saying good bye
But to Canada!
They sail from Liverpool tomorrow,steerage
Steerage? Nellie in the steerage?
And Mr and Mrs Cotterill they only have a little money left
 for when they got there
Steerage.Now we are soon change that
But they are sailing tomorrow
 afternoon,it's too late
Oh,no,it isn't I can telegraph 
Liverpool for first class cabin, go off by train in the morning
 and make them change
Steerage
Denry all right,listen we are both friends of theirs
Let's half the cost,you and I,and let's
 go together to Liverpool and see them off
That's a very good idea
We don't know how to thank you
We couldn't let you go like that
Mr and Mrs Cotterill
Yes
Would you please come and check your luggage
Someday I hope to repay you
Don't worry about that
-Good Bye Denry
-Good Bye Mrs Cotterill
Now I really think we should go
Yes
-Good Bye,Nellie darling
-Good Bye Ruth
Good Bye Nellie
Good Bye
-Look out
-Thank you Denry
All ashore that is going ashore
Time is getting short a minute,I left
 something to give you in,it's in the cab
There isn't any time,the bell is..
It just to dodge people to
 get off quickly,come on
This way
Don't be late,Sir
-Which one is it?
-Wait a minute,dear
In here
Lime Street Station
Denry!
-Will you please follow that cab?
-Sorry Mum,you've to take the cab in front
Downtown,cabbie
Exchange,please
Allow me
Thank you
It's always sad saying good bye to someone you're fond of,isn't it?
Yes it is
Your husband?
My husband? No.Just friend
I have no husband
I think seeing somebody off myself
Your wife?
Oh,no,only my sister.I'm not married
You are upset aren't you?
This is rather unpleasant district
 you know.
May I escort you back to civilization?
I have my car
Thank you
Look here if you don't dry up,
I'll have to cry myself
I'll send a telegram to your father and mother
They will get it when they land
What's you are going to do with me?
Do with you? Marry you,of course, what do you think
Marry me?
You feel happy?
If I had any sense I would
 have thought of it long ago
What about Ruth?
I'll hang Ruth.She can take care of herself
Are you sure you are quite comfortable?
Yes,thank you ,you are really very kind
Not at all
Where to,My Lord?
Where can I take you?
I'm staying at the Coronation Hotel
What an extra ordinary co-incidence,
I'm staying there too
To the hotel,please,Brown
Our leading citizen
What great cause has he ever been identified with
I think I can tell you that,Mr Duncalf
It's quite simple,He's identified with
 a great cause of cheering us all up
Look
Denry

All this has happened before.
And it will all happen again.
But this time it happened in London.
It happened on a quiet street in Bloomsbury.
That corner house over there is the home of the Darling family.
And Peter Pan chose this particular house... because there were people here who believed in him.
There was Mrs Darling.
George, dear, do hurry. We mustn't be late for the party, you know.
Mrs Darling believed that Peter Pan was the spirit of youth.
- But Mr Darling--
- Mary, unless I find my cuff links... we don't go to the party.
And if we don't go to the party, I can never show my face in the office again.
And if I can never-- Ouch!
Well, Mr Darling was a practical man.
The boys, however,
John and Michael... believed Peter Pan was a real person... and made him the hero of all their nursery games.
Blast you, Peter Pan!
Take that! Give up,
Captain Hook? Give up?
Never! I'll teach you to cut off me hand!
Oh, no, John.
It was the left hand.
Oh, yes.
Thank you, Wendy.
Wendy, the eldest, not only believed... she was the supreme authority on Peter Pan... and all his marvellous adventures.
Oh, Nana, must we always take that nasty tonic?
Nana, the nursemaid, being a dog... kept her opinions to herself... and viewed the whole affair with a certain tolerance.
Take that!
Insolent boy!
I'll slash you to ribbons!
And I'll cut you to pieces.
- Aha!
- Ouch!
- Careful, Michael, my glasses.
- I'm sorry,John.
You'll never leave this ship alive!
Oh, yes, I will.
Take that!
Scuttle me bones, boy,
I'll slit your gizzard.
Oh, no, you won't.
Back, back, back, you villain!
- Insolent pup!
- Wicked pirate!
- Aha, I got ya.
- You didn't either.
You never touched me.
Take that and that!
And that!
Boys, boys, less noise, please.
- Oh, hello, Father.
- You old bilge rat.
Wh-Wh-What?
Now, see here, Michael--
Oh, not you, Father.
You see, he's Peter Pan.
- And John's Captain Hook.
- Yes, yes, of course.
Uh, have you seen my cuff--
Oh, Nana, for goodness sake!
Where are those cuff links?
- Cuff links, Father?
- Yes, the gold ones.
Michael, the buried treasure.
Where is it?
- I don't know.
- The map then.
- Where's the treasure map?
- It got lost.
- Good heavens, my shirt front!
- Hurray! You found it!
- You found it!
- Yes, so I have.
And hereafter--
Don't paw me, Michael.
This is my last clean--
No! No!
George, dear, we really must hurry or we'll be late--
- Mary, look!
- George.
- It's only chalk, Father.
- Why, Michael.
It's not his fault.
It's in the story.
- And Wendy says--
- Wendy? Story?
I might have known. Wendy!
- Wendy!
- Yes, Father?
- Would you kindly ex--
- Oh, Mother!
- You look simply lovely.
- Thank you, dear.
- Wendy.
-Just my old gown made over.
- But it did turn out rather nicely, didn't--
- Mary, if you don't mind.
- I'd like--
- Why, Father, what have you done to your shirt?
What have I-- Oh!
- Now, George, really.
It comes right off.
- That's no excuse.
Wendy, haven't I warned you?
Stuffing the boys' heads with a lot of silly stories.
- Oh, but they aren't.
- I say they are.
Captain Crook!
Peter Pirate!
- Peter Pan, Father.
- Pan! Pirate! Poppycock!
- Oh, no, Father. Father, have you--
- Oh, you don't understand.
Absolute poppycock!
And let me tell you, this ridiculous--
- Now, George.
- ""Now, George.''
""Now, George''!
Well, ""Now, George,'' will have his say!
- Please, dear.
- Mary, the child's growing up.
It's high time she had a room of her own.
- Father!
- George!
- What?
- No!
- I mean it!
Young lady, this is your last night in the nursery.
And that's my last word on the matter--
No!
No!
Oh!
Poor Nana.
""Poor Nana''?
This is the last straw!
Out! Out, I say!
- No, Father, no!
- Yes!
There'll be no more dogs for nursemaids in this house!
Goodbye, Nana.
""Poor Nana.''
Oh, yes, ""Poor Nana.''
But ""Poor Father''?
Oh, no!
Blast it!
Where is that rope?
Oh, thank you.
Dash it all, Nana, don't look at me like that.
It's nothing personal.
It's just that--
Well, you're not really a nurse at all.
You're, well, a dog.
And the children aren't puppies.
They're people.
And sooner or later, Nana, people have to grow up.
But, Mother,
I don't want to grow up.
Now, dear, don't worry about it any more tonight.
He called Peter Pan
""absolute poppycock.''
I'm sure he didn't mean it,John.
Father was just upset.
Poor Nana, out there all alone.
No more tears, Michael.
It's a warm night.
She'll be all right.
- Mother.
- What is it, dear?
- Buried treasure.
- Now, children.
Don't judge your father too harshly.
After all, he really loves you very much.
Oh, don't lock it, Mother.
He might come back.
- ""He''?
- Yes, uh, Peter Pan.
You see, I found something that belongs to him.
- Oh? And what's that?
- His shadow.
- ""Shadow''?
- Mmm, Nana had it.
But I--
I took it away.
Oh? Yes, of course.
Good night, dear.
But, George, do you think the children will be safe without Nana?
Safe? Of course they'll be safe. Why not?
Well, Wendy said something about a shadow, and I--
- Shadow? Whose shadow?
- Peter Pan's.
Oh, Peter Pan--
Peter Pan!
You don't say. Goodness gracious, whatever shall we do?
- But, George-- Really, I--
- Sound the alarm!
- Call Scotland Yard!
- There must have been someone.
Oh, Mary, of all the impossible, childish fiddle-faddle.
Peter Pan indeed. How can we expect the children to grow up and be practical...
- George, dear.
- when you're as bad as they are.
- Please.
- No wonder Wendy gets these idiotic ideas.
Over there, Tink, in its den.
Is it there?
Must be here somewhere.
Tink! Shh!
Stop playing and help me find my shadow.
Shadow. Oh, shadow.
Huh?
Aha!
Peter Pan! Oh, Peter!
I knew you'd come back.
I saved your shadow for you.
Oh, I do hope it isn't rumpled.
You know, you look exactly the way I thought you would.
Oh, a little taller perhaps.
But then--
Oh, you can't stick it on with soap, Peter.
It needs sewing.
That's the proper way to do it.
Although, come to think of it,
I've never thought about it before.
Uh, sewing shadows, I mean.
Of course, I knew it was your shadow the minute I saw it.
And I said to myself, I said, ""I'll put it away for him until he comes back.
Oh, he's sure to come back.''
And you did, didn't you, Peter?
After all, one can't leave his shadow lying about and not miss it sooner or later.
Uh, don't you agree? But what
I still don't understand is how
Nana got it in the first place.
She really isn't-- Oh, sit down.
It won't take long.
She really isn't vicious, you know.
She's a wonderful nurse.
- Although Father says--
- Girls talk too much.
Yes, girls talk too--
Hmm? Oh.
- Well, get on with it, girl.
- Uh, my name is Wendy.
- Uh, Wendy Moira Angela Darl--
- Wendy's enough.
Oh, uh, but how did
Nana get your shadow, Peter?
Jumped at me the other night at the window.
Well, what were you doing there?
- I came to listen to the stories.
- My stories?
- But they're all about you.
- Of course.
That's why I like 'em.
I tell 'em to the Lost Boys.
The Lost Boys--
Oh, I remember.
- They're your men.
- Uh-huh.
I'm so glad you came back tonight.
I might never have seen you.
- Why?
- Because I have to grow up tomorrow.
- Grow up!
- Tonight's my last night in the nursery.
But that means no more stories.
- Mm-hmm.
- No!
I won't have it.
Come on!
Bu-Bu-But where are we going?
To Never Land.
- Never Land!
- You'll never grow up there.
Oh, Peter, it will be so wonderful.
But wait.
What would Mother say?
Mother? What's Mother?
Why, Peter, a mother is someone who-- who loves and cares for you.
- And-- And tells you stories--
- Good! You can be our mother.
- Come on.
- Now, just a minute, I--
Let me see now.
I-I have to pack.
Oh, and I must leave a note when I'll be back.
Of course, I couldn't stay too long.
And then I'll have to--
Oh, but Never Land.
Oh, I--
I-I'm so happy I--
I think I'll give you a-- a kiss.
What's a-- a kiss?
Oh, well, uh,
I-I'll show you.
- Oh!
- Stop! Stop it, Tink!
John,John, wake up!
He's here.
Huh? Jiminy!
Ooh, what in the world was that?
Tinker Bell.
Don't know what got into her.
Hello, Peter Pan.
I'm Michael.
And my name is John.
How do you do?
- Hello.
- Oh, look, a firefly.
- A pixie.
- Amazing!
- What's the pixie doing?
- Talking.
- What did she say?
- She says you're a big, ugly girl.
Oh. Well, I think she's lovely.
- Well, come on, Wendy, let's go.
- Where are we going?
- To Never Land.
- Never Land!
- Peter's taking us.
- ""Us''?
Well, of course. I-I couldn't go without Michael and John.
Oh, I should like very much to cross swords with some real buccaneers.
Yes, and fight pirates too.
Well, all right, but ya gotta take orders.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Me too.
But, Peter, how do we get to Never Land?
- Fly, of course.
- ""Fly''?
It's easy. All you have to do is to-- is to--
Is to--
- Ha! That's funny.
- What's the matter?
- Don't you know?
- Oh, sure.
It's-- It's just that
I never thought about it before.
Say, that's it!
You think of a wonderful thought.
- Any happy, little thought?
- Uh-huh.
- Like toys at Christmas?
- Sleigh bells, snow?
Yep! Watch me now.
Here I go!
It's easier than pie.
- He can fly!
- He can fly!
He flewed!
- Now you try.
- I'll think of a mermaid lagoon... underneath a magic moon.
I'll think I'm in a pirate's cave.
I think I'll be an Indian brave.
Now everybody try.
One, two, three!
We can fly! We can fly!
We can fly!
This won't do.
What's the matter with you?
All it takes is faith and trust.
Oh! And something
I forgot. Dust!
- Dust?
- Dust?
Yep, just a little bit of pixie dust.
Now, think of the happiest things.
- It's the same as having wings.
- Let's all try it just once more.
Look! We're rising off the floor.
-Jiminy!
- Oh, my! We can fly!
- You can fly!
- We can fly!
Come on, everybody.
Here we go!
Off to Never Land!
Think of a wonderful thought
Any merry little thought
Think of Christmas
Think of snow
Think of sleigh bells
Off you go like reindeer in the sky
You can fly, you can fly
You can fly
Think of the happiest things
It's the same as having wings
Take the path that moonbeams make
If the moon is still awake you'll see him wink his eye
You can fly, you can fly
You can fly
Up you go with a heigh and ho
To the stars beyond the blue
There's a Never Land waiting for you
Where all your happy dreams come true
Every dream that you dream will come true
Come on, Nana!
When there's a smile in your heart
There's no better time to start
Think of all thejoy you'll find
When you leave the world behind and bid your cares goodbye
You can fly, you can fly
You can fly, you can fly
You can fly
There it is, Wendy. Second star to the right and straight on till morning.
When there's a smile in your heart
There's no better time to start
Think of all thejoy you'll find when you leave the world behind
And bid your cares goodbye
You can fly, you can fly
You can fly, you can fly
You can fly
You can fly, you can fly
You can fly
Oh, a pirate's life is a wonderful life
A-rovin'over the sea
Give me a career as a buccaneer
It's the life of a pirate for me, oh
The life of a pirate for me
Oh, a pirate's life is a wonderful life
They never bury your bones
For when it's all over a jolly sea rover drops in on his friend, Davy Jones
Oh, my good friend
Davy Jones
- Good morning, shipmates.
- And what's good about it, Mr Smee?
Here we are, collecting barnacles on this miserable island.
While his nibs plays ring-around-the-rosy with Peter Pan.
Look out. It might go off.
We ought to be tending to the business of looting ships.
Why, I've almost forgotten how to slit a throat.
- Better hop it.
- And tell the captain... we wants to put to sea, see?
Peter Pan--
Blast that Peter Pan!
If I could only find his hideout,
I'd trap him in his lair.
But where is it?
Mermaid Lagoon?
No, we've searched that.
We've combed Cannibal Cove.
H-Here! No. No, no, no!
That's Indian terri--
But wait.
Those redskins know this island better than I do me own ship.
Ah...
I wonder.
- Good morning, Captain.
- I've got it!
Tiger Lily, Smee!
T-Tiger Lily, Captain?
The Chief's daughter.
She'll know where Pan is hiding.
B-B-But, but will she talk, Captain?
Oh, a little persuasion might be in order.
Now let me see.
Boiling in oil?
Keelhauling? Marooning?
A pirate's life is a wonderful l-life
You'll find adventure and sport
But live every minute for all that is in it
The life of a pirate is short
Oh, the life--
Now let me see, where was I?
Oh, dear, dear, dear Captain Hook.
Shooting a man in the middle of his cadenza?
It ain't good form, you know.
""Good form,'' Mr Smee?
Blast good form!
Did Pan show good form when he did this to me?
Why, Captain, cutting your hand off was only a childish prank, you might say.
Aye! But throwing it to the crocodile!
That cursed beast liked the taste of me so well... he's followed me ever since, licking his chops... for the rest of me.
And he'd have had you by now, Captain... if he hadn't swallowed that alarm clock.
But now when he's about, he warns ya as ya might say with his tick-tock... tick-tock, tick-tock.
Smee? Smee!
Oh, save me, Smee!
Please, don't let him get me, Smee!
Please, don't let him get me, Smee! Smee!
Here now, shame on ya.
Upsettin' the poor Captain.
There'll be no handouts today.
Shoo now, shoo!
Go on, go on, off it. Off with ya,
I say, go away, go away, out of here.
- Is he gone, Smee?
- Aye, Captain, all clear.
- Nothin' to worry about.
- Oh, Smee, Smee.
I can't stand it any longer.
I tell you, I can't.
Now, now, now, now, Captain.
Just relax.
What you need is a shave.
A nice soothing shave.
There now.
Oh, a pirate's life is a wonderful life
A-sailing over the sea
Give me a career as a--
Captain, you know,
I can't help noticin'... you just ain't been your usual jolly self of late.
Give me a career as a buccaneer
And the crew's gettin' a might uneasy, Captain.
That is, what's left of it.
Now, why don't we put to sea, see? Leave Never Land.
Forget Peter Pan.
There now!
Give me a career as a buccaneer
We'd all be a lot happier, not to mention a lot healthier.
Captain? Oh, dear! I never shaved him this close before.
Now, don't worry, Captain.
I-It must be somewhere about.
Get up, you idiot!
Aye, aye, sir.
Ooh! I found it, Captain.
- Good as new.
- Why, you blithering blockhead!
- Peter Pan ahoy!
- What? What? Where away?
Three points off the starboard bow!
Swoggle me eyes!
It is Pan!
Headed this way with some more of those scurvy brats!
Mr Smee, pipe up the crew!
A-Aye, aye, sir. Uh, pipe up the crew. Uh, pipe up the crew.
All hands on deck!
All hands on deck!
All hands on deck!
All hands on deck!
Look alive, you swabs!
- We've got him this time, Mr Smee.
- That we have, Captain.
Man the Long Tom, you bilge rats!
- I've waited years for this.
- That's not countin' the holidays either.
Double the powder and shorten the fuse!
Shorten the powder and double the fuse!
A pretty sight, Mr Smee.
We'll pot 'em like sitting ducks.
- All right, men! Range 42.
- ""Range 42.''
- Elevation 65.
- ""Elevation 65.''
- Three degrees west.
- ""Three degrees west.''
Steady now! Steady!
Oh, Peter, it's just as
I've always dreamed it would be.
Oh, look,John, there's Mermaid Lagoon.
By Jove!
And the Indian encampment!
Oh, look, there's
Captain Hook and the pirates.
Look out!
Quick, Tink, take Wendy and the boys to the island.
I'll stay here and draw Hook's fire.
Hook! Hook!
You codfish! Here!
Tinker Bell? Not so fast.
Please, Tinker Bell.
We can't keep up with you.
Tinker Bell! Wait!
Ouch!
So!
- Who ya shovin'?
- Who ya shovin'?
- You! That's who!
I'll show you!
Huh? Orders from Pan?
- Hold it, men!
- What's the orders, Tink?
- A terrible what?
- Wendy Bird.
- ""Wendy Bird''?
- Flying this way?
- Uh, Pan's orders are--
What? Smash it?
- Kick it?
- Stomp it?
- Stomp it?
- Oh! Shoot it down!
- Shoot it down!
- Yeah!
- Yeah, shoot it down!
- Come on, follow Tink!
- Follow Tink!
- Let's go!
- Yeah, come on. Let's go then!
- We're gonna get 'er!
- I see it!
- Me too!
- Me too!
Ready, aim... fire!
Oh, Peter, you saved my life.
- Are you hurted, Wendy?
- No, Michael.
Good heavens, Wendy, you might have been killed.
- Hey! Hey! Pan!
- We followed your orders, Pan!
- Hey, Pan, I got it with my skull buster!
- Ya did not! We did!
- I did it, Pan! I did it!
- No, I did!
Attention! Well...
I'm certainly proud of you, you blockheads!
- I bring ya a mother to tell ya stories--
- A mother?
- And you shoot her down.
- Well, Tink said it was a bird!
- Tink said what?
- Well, she said you said to shoot it down!
Tinker Bell. Tink!
Come here. You're charged with high treason, Tink.
Are you guilty or not guilty?
Guilty? But don't ya know ya might have killed her?
Tinker Bell!
I hereby banish you forever.
Please, not forever.
Well, for a week then. Come on, Wendy,
I'll show you the island.
Oh, Peter, uh, the mermaids?
- Aw, let's go huntin'!
- Tigers?
- Naw, bears.
- Naw, bears.
Personally, I should prefer to see the aborigines.
- And the Indians too.
- All right, men!
Go out and capture a few Indians.
-John, you be the leader.
- I shall try to be worthy of my post.
Forward! March!
- Come on, bear.
- Oh, Michael, do be careful.
Come on, Wendy.
I'll show you the mermaids.

Oh, Blackfoot tribe.
Belongs to the Algonquin group.
- Quite savage, you know.
- Uh, let's go get 'em.
- Come on! We'll get 'em!
- Gentlemen, gentlemen.
- First, we must plan our strategy.
- Uh, what's strategy?
A plan of attack. The initial phase is an encircling manoeuvre, thus!
John! Indians! Indians!
Let me in!
Now remember, the Indian is cunning...
- Hey--
- but not intelligent.
Therefore, we simply surround them and take them by surprise--
I'm frightfully sorry, old chaps.
It's all my fault.
- Aw, that's all right, Wildcat.
- Oh, we don't mind.
That's okay.
- How!
- Uh, h-how, Chief!
- How!
For many moons red man fight paleface Lost Boys.
- Ugh.
- Ugh, ugh.
- Sometime you win.
- Sometime we win.
- Okay, Chief.
Uh, you win this time.
Now, turn us loose.
""Turn us loose''?
You mean this is only a game?
Sure! When we win, we turn them loose.
- When they win, they turn us loose.
- They turn us loose.
This time, no turn 'em loose.
- Huh?
- Huh?
- The Chief's a great spoofer.
- Me no spoof'em.
Where you hide
Princess Tiger Lily?
- Uh, Tiger Lily?
- We ain't got your old princess.
- I've certainly never seen her.
- Me neither.
- Honest we don't.
- Heap big lie.
If Tiger Lily not back by sunset... burn 'em at stake.
Just imagine, real live mermaids.
- Would you like to meet 'em?
- Oh, Peter, I'd love to.
All right, come on.
- It's Peter.
- Oh!
- Hello, Peter!
- Hello, Peter!
- Hello, Peter!
- Hello!
Hello, Peter!
- Hello, girls.
- I'm so glad to see you.
Why did you stay away so long?
Did you miss me?
- Tell us one of your adventures.
- Something exciting.
Want to hear about the time
I cut off Hook's hand and threw it to the crocodile?
- Oh, I've always liked that one.
- Me too.
Well, there I was on
Marooner's Rock surrounded...
- Oh, Peter!
- by 40 or 50 pirates.
- Who's she?
Huh? Her?
Oh, that's Wendy.
- A girl?
- What's she doing here?
And in her nightdress too.
Come on, dearie.
Join us for a swim.
- Oh, please, I'm not dressed for it.
- Oh, but you must!
- We insist!
- No, no, please!
- Too good for us, eh?
- Peter!
- If you dare to come near me again--
- Wendy! Wendy!
They were just having a little fun, weren't you, girls?
- That's all.
- We were only trying to drown her.
- Ya see?
- Well, if you think for one minute...
- that I'm going to put up with a--
- Shh. Hold it, Wendy.
- Yep, it's Hook, all right.
- Hook!
- Hook!
Hook! Oh!
Quick, Wendy.
They've captured Tiger Lily.
Looks like they're headin' for Skull Rock.
Come on, Wendy.
Let's see what they're up to.
Now, me dear Princess, this is me proposition.
You tell me the hiding place of Peter Pan... and I shall set you free.
- You dog.
- Poor Tiger Lily.
Am I not a man of me word, Mr Smee?
Oh, yes, always, Captain.
You'd better talk, me dear, for soon the tide will be in... and then it will be too late.
- I'll show the old codfish.
Stay here, Wendy, and watch the fun.
- ""Fun''?
Remember... there is no path through water... to the happy hunting ground.
This is your last chance,
Tiger Lily!
Manatoa, great spirit of mighty seawater, speak!
Beware, Captain Hook!
Beware! Beware!
- Did you hear that, Smee?
- It's an evil spirit, Captain.
Stand by, Smee, while I take a look around.
Spirit of the great seawater, is it?
Psst! Wendy. Watch this.
- Mr Smee!
- Uh, yes, Captain?
Release the princess and take her back to her people.
Aye, aye, sir.
Release the princess--
- But-- But, Captain--
- Those are me orders, Mr Smee!
Aye, aye, sir.
- Well, at last Captain Hook's comin' to his senses.
- Odd's fish!
I told him all along you Indians wouldn't betray Peter Pan.
And just what do you think you are doing, Mr Smee?
Just what you told me, Captain.
Carryin' out your orders.
- My orders?
- Why, yes, Captain.
Didn't you just say to go--
Put her back!
You blithering idiot!
- My orders. Of all the bumbling--
- Mr Smee!
Just exactly what do you think you are doing?
Putting her back like you said, Captain.
I said nothing of the sort!
Oh, but, C-Captain, d-d-didn't you?
I thought that--
For the last time, Mr Smee.
Take the princess back to her people.
Understand? Understand?
Understand? Understand?
- Uh, aye, aye, sir.
- Oh, and one more thing.
When you return to the ship, tell the whole crew... to help themselves to me best rum.
- Peter!
- Here's your spirit, Smee!
Why, it's Peter Pan.
- Scurvy brat!
- Thank you, Captain.
Come down, boy, if you've a taste for cold steel.
- Watch this, Wendy.
- Oh, Peter, do be careful.
- Try your luck, Mr Smee?
- Let him have it!
Well, come on, you idiot!
Blast him!
Right here, Mr Smee.
Hold it, you fool!
No! No!
Captain?
Oh, how dreadful.
What a pity, Mr Smee.
I'm afraid we've lost the dear Captain.
Captain!
In the back, Captain?
Give it to him, Captain!
Cleave him to the brisket.
I've got you this time, Pan.
Well, well, a codfish on a hook.
I'll get you for this, Pan, if it's the last thing I do!
I say, Captain, do you hear something?
No.
No!
No!
Mr Crocodile, do you like codfish?
- You do?
- Oh, Peter, no!
No!
- Smee!
- D-Don't go away, Captain!
Uh, stay right there now, sir.
I'll save ya, sir.
Smee!
Smee!
Smee!
Ow!
Captain! Captain!
Smee! Smee!
- Give him back!
- Smee--
Row for the ship!
Row for the ship--
Whoa!
Smee!
Peter, what about Tiger Lily?
Tiger Lily?
Oh, Tiger Lily.
Help--
Peter. Wait for me.
That cursed Peter Pan.
Making a fool out of me.
Oh, my head.
Oh, a pirate's life is a wonderful life
- Your hot water, Mr Smee.
- Shh!
The poor Captain has a splitting headache.
We mustn't annoy him.
Well, Captain, it's nice to see you smiling again.
Brings back the good old days when we was leadin' a healthy, normal life.
Scuttlin' ships, cuttin' throats.
Oh, Captain... why don't we put to sea again?
You know, there's trouble brewin' on the island.
Women trouble.
I wouldn't want this to go any farther, but... the cook told me that the first mate told him... that he heard that Pan has banished Tinker Bell.
Whoa!
Why, you doddering imbecile, I--
Did you say Pan... has banished Tinker Bell?
Aye, aye, Captain.
That he has.
- But why?
- Well, on account of Wendy, Captain.
Tink tried to do her in, she did.
Tink's terrible jealous.
- Well, well.
- That's why we ought to leave, Captain.
This ain't no place for a respectable pirate.
That's it, Smee!
That's it!
I'm glad you agrees, Captain.
Quick, me coat.
Me best dress coat.
Aye, aye, sir. The sooner we get going, the better.
Ah, yes, a jealous female can be tricked into anything.
- My case of hooks!
- Aye, aye, sir.
Here you are, sir.
Your Sunday set, sir.
If we impress the pixie, convince her we're eager to help her... the wench may chart our course to a... certain hiding place.
Our best hiding place is the Spanish main, sir.
I'll set our course--
And where do you think you are going?
T-To tell the boys we sails with the tide, sir.
You will go ashore, pick up Tinker Bell... and bring her to me.
Understand?
Aye, aye, s-s-s-sir.
- How!
- How!
What's the Chief doing,John?
He's delivering an oration in sign language.
- What's he saying?
- He says...
""Peter Pan, mighty warrior.
""Save Tiger Lily.
Make big Chief heap glad.''
Well, he certainly doesn't look ""heap glad.''
Make Peter Pan heap big chief.
You now Little Flying Eagle.
- Hurray for Flying Eagle! Flying Eagle!
- Hurray!
Hurray!
- Oh, how wonderful!
- Hurray!
Teach 'em paleface brother all about red man.
Good, this should be most enlightening.
Uh, what makes the red man red?
- When did he first say, ""Ugh''?
- First say, ""Ugh''?
Why does he ask you, ""How''?
""Why does he ask you, 'How'?''

Squaw go home.
Beggin' your pardon, Miss Bell... but Captain Hook would like a word with ya.
Yes, Miss Bell,
Captain Hook admits defeat.
Tomorrow I leave the island, never to return.
I'm glad to hear that, Captain.
I'll tell the crew and--
And that's why I asked you over, me dear... to tell Peter
I bear him no ill will.
Oh, Pan has his faults, to be sure.
Uh, bringing that Wendy to the island, for instance.
Dangerous business, that.
Why, rumour has it that already she has come between you and Peter.
But what's this?
Tears?
Then it is true.
Oh, Smee.
The way of a man with a maid.
Taking the best years of her life and then... casting her aside like an old glove!
Ain't it a bloomin' shame?
But we mustn't judge
Peter too harshly, me dear.
It's that Wendy who's to blame.
Mr Smee, we must save the lad from himself.
But how?
We've so little time.
We sail in the morning.
Sail! That's it, Smee!
- We'll shanghai Wendy.
- ""Shanghai Wendy,'' Captain?
Take her to sea with us.
With her gone, Peter will soon forget this mad infatuation.
Come, Smee, we must leave immediately.
Surround Peter's home--
But, Captain, we-- we don't know where Peter Pan lives!
Great Scott, you're right, Smee!
What's that, my dear?
You could show us the way?
Why, I never thought of that.
- Take this down, Smee.
- ""Take this down, Smee.''
Aye, aye, Captain.
- Start at Pegleg Point.
- ""Start at Pegleg Point.''
- Forty paces west of Blindman's Bluff.
- ""Blindman's Bluff.''
Yes, yes. Hop, skip and a jump across Crocodile Creek.
Then north by northeast, one, two, three.
Well, get on with it--
Continue, my dear.
I mustn't harm Peter?
Madam, Captain Hook gives his word... not to lay a finger... or a hook on Peter Pan.
Ah, Hangman's Tree.
So that's the entrance to his hiding place.
Thank you, me dear.
You've been most helpful.

Big Chief Flying Eagle greets his braves.
- How!
- Uh, how, Chief.
- How, Chief! How!
- How.
- How.
Big Chief greets Little Mother.
- How!
- Ugh!
Aw, Wendy, is that all you have to say?
- Everyone else thinks I'm wonderful.
- Especially Tiger Lily.
- Tiger Lily?
-John! Michael!
Take off that war paint and get ready for bed.
- Bed?
- Brave no sleep.
Go for days without sleep.
- But, boys, we're going home in the morning.
- Home!
- And--
- Oh, Wendy, we don't want to go home.
No go home. Stay many moons.
Have heap big time.
Now, Peter, let's stop pretending and be practical.
Chief Flying Eagle has spoken.
Oh, for goodness sake.
Please, boys.
Do you want to stay here and grow up like-- like savages?
- Of course.
- But you can't.
You need a mother.
We all do.
Aren't you our mother, Wendy?
Why, Michael, of course not!
Surely you haven't forgotten our real mother!
Did she have silky ears and wear a fur coat?
Oh, no, Michael.
That was Nana.
I think I had a mother once.
- What was she like?
- What was she like?
- I forget.
- I had a white rat!
- That's no mother!
Hey, who ya shovin'?
No, no, boys! Please.
I'll tell you what a mother is.
- Yeah, tell us.
- Yeah, tell us.
- Please, Wendy.
Well, a mother, a real mother... is the most wonderful person in the world.
She's the angel voice... that bids you good night... kisses your cheek... whispers, ""Sleep tight.''
Your mother
And mine
Your mother
And mine
The helping hand that guides you along
Whether you're right
Whether you're wrong
Your mother
And mine
Your mother
And mine
What makes mothers all that they are
Might as well ask what makes a star
Ask your heart to tell you her worth
Your heart will say
Heaven on earth
- Another word
- Shh.
For divine
Your mother
And mine
- I wanna see my mother.
- Yes, Michael.
I propose we leave for home at once.
- Could I go too? Huh, Wendy?
- Me too, Wendy!
- Come on! Let me go!
All right, boys. All right. I'm sure
Mother would be glad to have you.
Uh, that is, if Peter doesn't mind.
Go on!
Go back and grow up!
But I'm warning ya.
Once you're grown up... you can never come back!
- Never!
- Dear.
- Well, then, shall we be off?
- Yeah, come on. Let's go!
- Yeah!
- See ya, Peter.
They'll be back.
Peter.
Goodbye, Peter.
All right, men.
Take them away.
And now, Smee, to take care of Master Peter Pan.
But, Captain, wouldn't it be more humane-like to slit his throat?
Aye, that it would, Mr Smee.
But I have given me word not to lay a finger... or a hook on Peter Pan.
And Captain Hook never breaks a promise.

Join up with Captain Hook
- Hey, I wanna join!
- Please! Oh, boy!
- I wanna be a pirate!
- Oh, boy! A pirate!
Boys! Aren't you ashamed of yourselves?
But Captain Hook is most insistent, Wendy.
Yeah! He says we'll walk the plank if we don't.
Oh, no, we won't.
Peter Pan will save us.
Peter Pan will save them, Smee.
Peter Pan will save them.
Oh, Captain, you did it.
But a thousand pardons, my dear.
I don't believe you are in on our little joke.
You see, we left a present for Peter.
Sort of a surprise package, you might say.
Why, I can see our little friend at this very moment... reading the tender inscription.
""To Peter, with love from Wendy.
Do not open till 6 o'clock.''
Huh. I wonder what's in it.
Could he but see within the package... he would find an ingenious little device.
Set, so that when the clock is like this...
Peter Pan will be blasted... out of Never Land forever.
No!
But time grows short.
We have but 1 8 seconds.
Fifteen seconds.
Thirteen seconds.
Twelve seconds.
Well, I guess
I can open it now.
Hey, Tink.
Look what Wendy left.
Hey, stop that! Stop it!
What's the matter with you?
Hook? A bomb?
Don't be ridiculous!
And so passeth a worthy opponent.
Amen.
Hook! It was a bomb!
Why, if it hadn't been for Tink-- Tinker Bell!
Tink? Tinker Bell?
Where are you, Tink?
Tink? Tinker Bell!
Tink. Are you all right?
Wendy? The boys?
But I've gotta save you first.
Hold on, Tink! Hold on!
Don't go out.
Don't you understand, Tink?
You mean more to me than anything in this whole world!
And now, which will it be?
The pen or the plank?
Captain Hook, we will never join your crew.
As you wish.
Ladies first, my dear.
- Goodbye, boys.
- Goodbye, Wendy.
- Goodbye, Wendy.
- Be brave,John.
- I shall strive to, Wendy.
- Goodbye, Michael.
- Goodbye, Wendy.
- Come on!
- Get along over there!
- Get going, miss. Get going!
Don't give us no trouble!
Go on! Go on!
Get it over with!
- Move along!
- The Captain's waitin'!
Wendy! Wendy!
- Captain, n-no splash.
- Not a sound.
- Not a bloomin' ripple.
- It's a jinx, that's what it is.
- No splash.
- No sign of the wench.
- Did you hear a splash?
- I'm telling you, mates, it's a black day.
Mark me words.
We'll all pay for this.
The ship is bewitched.
No splash, Captain.
So, you want a splash, Mr Starkey.
I'll give you a splash!
- Who's next?
- You're next, Hook!
- This time you've gone too far!
- It's Pan! Peter Pan!
- And Wendy!
- It can't be!
It's his blinkin' ghost what's talkin'!
Say your prayers, Hook.
I'll show you this ghost has blood in his veins.
I'll run him through! Ooh!
Take that!
Curse this hook!
Come on, everybody!
Hurry, Michael! Hurry!
Don't stand there, you bilge rats!
Get those scurvy brats!
After the brats, men!
This is no mere boy.
'Tis some fiend fighting me.
A flying devil!
- Hold your fire.
- Get 'em!
Steady, men. Steady.
- Club 'em with the marline.
- Fire!
- I'll crack their bloomin' skulls!
- Let me at 'em!
Down, you blackguard!
Hurray!
- Right through, Michael.
- Yea, Bear Killer!
- Yea for Bear Killer!
Fly! Fly! Fly! You coward!
Coward? Me?
Ha-ha-ha! You wouldn't dare fight old Hook man-to-man!
You'd fly away like a cowardly sparrow!
Nobody calls Pan a coward and lives!
I'll fight you man-to-man, with one hand behind my back.
- You mean you won't fly?
- No, don't, Peter! It's a trick!
- I give my word, Hook.
- Good, then let's have at it!
Now! Insolent youth, prepare to die!
Fly! Fly, Peter! Fly!
No! I gave my word.
You're mine, Hook!
Cleave him to the brisket!
You wouldn't do old Hook in now, would you, lad?
I'll go away forever.
I'll do anything you say.
Well, all right.
If ya say you're a codfish.
- I'm a codfish.
- Louder!
- I'm a codfish!
- Hurray!
Hook is a codfish
A codfish, a codfish
-Hook is a codfish, a codfish, a codfish
-All right, Hook... you're free to go, and never return.
Peter!
Smee! Smee!
Smee!
Smee! Smee!
Smee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee!
Captain!
Captain! Captain!
Hurray!
Hurray for Captain Pan!
All right, ya swabs, aloft with ya!
We're castin' off!
Heave those halyards!
But, but, Peter--
Oh, that is, Captain Pan.
- At your service, madam.
- Could you tell me, sir, where we're sailing?
- To London, madam.
- Oh, Peter.
Michael!John!
We're going home!
Man the capstan!
Hoist anchor!
Pixie dust!
George, I am so glad you changed your mind about Wendy.
After all, she's still a child.
Oh, pshaw, Mary.
You know I never mean those things.
Do I, Nana?
Oh! Wendy!
Wendy, what on earth are you doing there?
Mmm. Hmm?
- Oh, Mother, we're back!
- Back?
All except the Lost Boys.
They weren't quite ready.
- Lost Bo-- Ready?
- To grow up.
That's why they went back to Never Land.
- Never Land?
- Yes, but I am.
- Uh, ""am''?
- Uh, ready to grow up.
Oh! Oh! Uh--
Well, my dear, all in good time.
- After all, perhaps we were too--
- Oh, but, Mother... it was such a wonderful adventure.
Tinker Bell and the mermaids and Peter Pan.
Oh, he was the most wonderful of all.
- Why, why, even when we were kidnapped, I--
- Kidnapped!
Mm-hmm. I knew Peter Pan would save us, and he did.
And we all called him a codfish!
Uh, Captain Hook, I mean.
And then we sailed away on a ship in the sky.
Hmm. Mary, I'm going to bed.
Oh, Mother.
He really is wonderful, isn't he?
See how well he sails the ship.
- George. George!
- Now what, Mary?
Nana, d-did you see--
You know, I have the strangest feeling... that I've seen that ship before.
A long time ago... when I was very young.
- George, dear.
- Father.
When there's a smile in your heart
There's no better time to start
Think of all thejoy you'll find
When you leave the world behind
And bid your cares goodbye
You can fly
You can fly
You can fly
Glass of double rum.
Aah. This here is a quiet cove.
Much company, mate?
Not much, sir.
- Who'd be the owner?
- My mother.
- Where is your mother?
- In the town.
Hmm.
- What's your name?
- Jim Hawkins.
Well, Jim, you seems a likely lad.
Ever notice a seafaring man alongside this here grogshop?
Not many come out so far, sir.
None by the name of Captain William Bones?
Bones, sir?
No matter. Fill her up.
Jim!
- Was it a one-legged man?
- No, sir.
But he had a terrible scar.
Black Dog!
When you sees Black Dog, you lay to it.
The man with the one leg ain't far off.
Rum, Jim. Fetch me rum.
I can't, Captain. I promised Dr. Livesy.
Oh, hang all doctors! Give me rum!
No, Captain!
Please, Captain Bones.
Doctor said it'd kill you!
If you don't stop,
I'll run to town for the Doctor.
And the Squire, too.
Got to get me strength back, Jim.
Got to pull out of here.
Now, then, boy, take me to Captain Billy Bones, or I'll break your arm.
Straight to him, now. March!
Here's a friend for you, Bill.
- It's Pew.
- Pew as ever was, Bill.
Back with a gift from all your old shipmates.
Boy, take him by the wrist and bring his hand close to mine.
And now that's done.
The black spot.
They come at dark.
I know what they're after, but they won't get it out of me.
What's rightful mine is mine!
Give me a hand, Jim.
We'll do that one-legged man yet!
Captain!
Captain!
The old hulk's grounded, Jim.
Can't shove off.
Go and bring help.
And don't peach, and I'll go shares.
If them muttonheads that slipped me the black spot gets here before you come back, they won't find that on me.
Skip, now.
Luck, matey!
Rouse out, mates!
Horses coming! Run for it!
Here, sir.
Well, Livesy?
Did his doomsday. But he wasn't killed.
He died of shock, or rum.
I wonder what those rascals wanted of him.
I think I can tell you, Squire Trelawney.
Now he's dead, I can.
Odds, my life!
Doctor!
Flint's map. How did you come by it, lad?
Why, he gave it to me, sir, when he sent me for help.
- He said I'd share.
- Share what?
You don't know? Pirate treasure, man!
Flint's gold! Why, everybody knows of the ships Flint plundered.
That fellow must've been the only one who knew where the treasure was hid.
So that's what those scoundrels wanted.
The map of Flint's Treasure Island!
Latitude, longitude, crosses to mark the deposits.
Money to roll in!
You're a trump, young Hawkins.
Mark my words, you will share.
Spy Glass Hill bearing south-southeast, to Finger Trunk Tree by Devil's Rock.
Thence two cables south...
- Go on, go on!
- Bear to larboard, due northeast to foot of White Crag,
10 paces east...
Chest of £700,000!
My servants, Livesy.
Come in, Tom Redruth! Come in, Williams!
They got away, sir.
They had a lugger tied up at Kitt's Hole, sir.
Aye, you gave them a run for it, boys.
They'll not be back.
Thank you, Tom Redruth. Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Shh.
Mum's the word.
We'll take Redruth and Williams along.
Make sailors of them.
We'll have favorable winds, a quick passage, and gold enough to play duck and drake with ever after, hey, Hawkins?
If you weren't so confounded exclamatory, Trelawney, we might understand you better.
Just what is it you propose to do?
Do? Fit out a ship! That's what I'll do!
With a clue like this, by Christopher, we'll have Flint's treasure if it takes a year!
Can't you feel the deck under your feet, and a good trade wind filling our sails?
How preposterous. A doctor can't go chasing across the world and leave his practice behind him.
Hang your practice. I'm your practice.
Do you think I'd put to sea without a ship's doctor?
Besides, it's a risky business.
We aren't the only ones who know of Flint's map.
Those fellows who ransacked this inn tonight are desperate men.
Surely, you don't fear them, Livesy?
No. There's only one man I'm afraid of.
Name the dog.
You, sir. For you can't hold your tongue.
Why, confound you, Doctor.
I'm no tittle-tattle.
An adventure of this kind,
I'd be silent as the grave.
Now, then, Hawkey.
Tomorrow, I start for Bristol to find a ship.
Once you settle your affairs here, you and Jim can follow.
- Jim?
- Aye, Hawkins. You'll come.
You'll make a famous cabin boy, Hawkins!
His mother may have something to say about that.
She'd listen to you, sir, if she knew you were going.
Until I've made up my own mind,
I don't know what I could tell her.
Tell her that in three weeks' time...
Three weeks? Two weeks! Ten days!
Jim Hawkins will be sailing with the choicest crew and the finest ship's doctor in all England.
Will you, sir?
To be sure he will, boy!
I'll wager my wig on it.
Dr. Livesy! Dr. Livesy!
Look, Doctor. It's Squire Trelawney!
Admiral Trelawney, at least.
Livesy. Ahoy!
Ahoy!
And Jim. How did you two find the journey?
Abominable roads.
The sea's the only high road for an Englishman.
Come here.
There she rides, Livesy.
The good ship Hispaniola.
- Beautiful, Trelawney! Beautiful!
- Stout, too.
She'll bring back all the pirate gold that we can put aboard her!
Shh. No talk of treasure in a public place. I beg of you.
Aye, mum's the word.
Jim?
Well, Jim, don't you want to eat, lad?
If there's time before we sail, sir.
- Sail.
- When do we sail?
Better ask Captain Smollett.
Five days he's been selecting a crew.
- Six men are all he's got to show for it.
- Cautious, eh?
"Cautious"?
He pries through every seaman's past like a judge at a quarter session.
When I threatened to step in, he told me to hire a sea cook.
So, by Jove, I did hire a sea cook, right out of his own tavern.
Fellow by the name of Long John Silver.
I didn't waste my time poring over his credentials.
All the credentials I needed was a taste of his ham and his buttered eggs.
You can judge for yourself.
- Top of the mornin', gentlemen.
- Ahoy, John Silver.
Sit ye down, the tables are starving, if ye kindly will.
For you, sir, piping hot.
And this be for Dr. Livesy.
Asking his pardon for being that familiar, but Squire has told me so much about the two of ye, it comes natural to call ye by name, it do.
And this will be young Master Hawkins,
I'll be bound.
Hawkins.
'Tis a proper seafaring name, too.
You run your house well, my man, and you keep a good table, too.
Thank ye kindly, sir.
It isn't often I see fruit in an English tavern for breakfast.
'Tis a rule of health I learned while sailing under the immortal Hawke.
- Ah. Rest him.
- Did you hear that?
Him, sailing under Hawke!
I was with him in '59 at Quiberon Bay.
When you shipped with the Admiral, you never took scurvy from the salt pork and hardtack.
Not with a barrel of apples aboard for the men to chew on.
There's sense in that, Trelawney.
Something we could profit by.
And will, by gad.
There'll be apples on my ship, too.
You favor the Admiral yourself,
Squire, if I may say so.
Why, you and he could make up your mind like that!
- Do I now?
- That ye do, sir. I noticed it afore.
It wouldn't surprise me none to hear you say,
"Heave up the anchor.
We sails on the hour."
Can't sail without a crew.
With all the hemming and hawing that goes on, you'd think there wasn't an honest seaman to be had in Bristol.
I begs to differ, sir, if I may make so bold.
Why, there's a full cargo of my old shipmates that sailed with Hawke becarrmed right here in Bristol.
Sound men inside, if some of them was scarred in the service of England.
And they with no pensions, neither.
Could a score of those foremost hands be had on short notice?
Aye, sir, but they wouldn't be pretty enough for the modern taste.
Nowadays, they picks the younger men by the cut of their jib.
Not the old ones for their experience.
Appearances be hanged!
Silver, get me those men.
But it ain't a cook's place to muster no hands.
That's captain's work.
It's an owner's place, by the hokey.
If you can bring in a crew of your stouthearted lads come sundown,
I, for one, will be greatly obliged.
- Well, sir, if 'tis owner's orders...
- Bully boy.
But I don't like to be pushing athwart my betters, but I'll say this, sir,
I know every seaman in these here parts like the palm of this hand.
Did you know Captain Billy Bones?
Bones?
Billy Bones?
What ship did he sail in, matey?
He was a pirate.
Lord love ye, lad.
Didn't you know that them that sailed with Admiral Hawke had no speaking acquaintance with pirates?
Lessen they boarded us.
Aye, Jim, you're the spitting image of me when I was your age.
Head full of pirates.
But he'll find, same as I, that the sea be mostly hard work.
And the biggest satisfaction a man gets is doing his duty.
Quite right, eh, Jim?
Come, Livesy. Shall we go aboard?
But I just thought if he knew Billy Bones...
'Course you did. Of course he did.
Beggin' your pardon, Squire.
Could ye spare me the lad today?
I've more than my hands full putting the inn shipshape and rounding up a crew.
Sound idea.
You stay and lend him a hand, Jim.
- But, sir...
- Don't fail me, Silver. Livesy.
Come now, Jim, lad. Time be wasting.
Down there, matey.
Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight!
Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight!
Who hailed you, you old bumboat?
Belay!
Belay! Belay!
Ain't you the pretty one?
Swearing blue fire in front of a gentleman.
Living up to her name, she be.
Captain Flint, I calls her, after the famous buccaneer.
'Twas the pirates taught her to swear.
Now, if you want to know about pirates, just you ask Captain Flint.
Why she can...
Well, blow me down for an old sea calf.
"Do you know any pirates?" says you.
"Not on speaking terms," says I.
Yet, here, under my nose, is Captain Flint.
I'll wager you can't make her talk.
Pirates, Captain Flint! Pirates!
Pieces of eight! Hello, boy. Hello.
You're a smart one, Jim.
Smart as paint you are!
'Tain't everyone can make that bird talk.
Hey there! Glass of double rum.
Black Dog! Stop him!
Stop him!
Cady. Run, catch him!
No. Not him. Him!
- Who did you say he was?
- Black Dog.
He was one of the...
He was one of the pirates.
One of them swabs? After him, all of ye!
Run him down!
And if you don't catch him, don't you come back!
What was he doing here, I'd like to know.
Sharks like him, they'll give my house a bad name.
What would the new landlord say?
Why, he'd never set foot in the place again.
Now, would he?
Black Dog, eh? I'll black dog him.
I never thought the day'd come
I'd need this pistol against them cutthroats.
Heavy ball and a light charge of powder works best on a touchy little craft like this, here.
Try the balance?
See the engraving on the trigger guard?
Solid silver.
Butler of London made that there sidearm for Admiral Hawke.
And the Admiral, he give it to me for loyal service aboard the old Portland.
Do ye think you could shoot one?
- Oh! Yes, sir.
- All right, then.
You are a smart one.
I might've known you could handle a firearm.
Now, put it in your pocket and keep it there at half cock.
But don't go waving it in the face of every man who asks for a glass of stout.
- Oh, no, Mr. Silver.
- But if you clamps your dead lights on that there Black Dog again, repel boarders.
- I know, sir.
- And I knows a lad I can trust while I'm out doing my duty by Squire.
And when I come back,
I'll have a crew and you'll have a pistol.
- You mean to keep?
- That's my meaning, matey.
You've got the word of Long John Silver.
- Shipmates.
- Shipmates.
Boat alongside, sir.
Step lively there. Get a move on.
- Get up. Get up with us.
- Ahoy!
Line up there.
All hands muster aft.
Long John Silver, reporting as ordered, sir.
- I see you did it, Silver.
- Like I said, Mr. Trelawney, they ain't pretty, but they knows the sea.
Picked up Hawke's old helmsman, we did.
And a boatswain what pipes man-o'-war fashions.
- Splendid, Silver. Splendid!
- Heave to!
Captain.
Well, Captain, here's your crew.
Would you care to have a word with them?
- Mr. Arrow?
- Yes, sir.
Record the names and sailing records of every man jack on board for entry into the log.
- And check your watches.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Step forward, there. Step lively.
And now, sir, I'd like to have a word with you in the cabin, if I may.
And you, Doctor.
Fetch your gear and take it below.
Captain Smollett, here's to our speedy departure.
Thank you, sir.
Well, I have something on my mind, and at the risk of giving offense,
I'd better speak plain.
I don't like this cruise and I don't like the men.
Possibly, sir, you may not like your employer, either.
Stay a bit, Trelawney. No need for ill feeling till we hear the captain out.
I don't like secret voyages,
Mr. Trelawney, when the only secret kept is the one in my sealed orders.
Everybody else about the town is saying that we're headed for a treasure island with a marked map to guide us.
Someone's been talking.
Well, I never breathed a word.
Livesy, have you?
In my experience, adventure of this kind may mean life and death, and a close run.
We may need a trustworthy crew.
Not one recruited by the ship's cook.
That ship's cook was acting under my orders, sir!
Well, is the cook responsible for the ship's safety?
Well, really! I...
We're all concerned with the ship's safety, Captain.
As matters stand, what measures would you propose?
Two. The whereabouts of any treasure maps to be kept strictly secret from myself and my mate, Mr. Arrow.
The firearms removed from the forward hold and stored aft, here.
Surely you don't anticipate mutiny?
If I did, I wouldn't put to sea at all.
The garrison arrangement's a sensible precaution.
That's fair enough, Trelawney.
Very well. If it'll get us out to sea.
- Agreed then, sir.
- Good.
Now, Captain.
You will find I'll do my duty.
Hang it, Livesy.
Why'd you take the fellow's part?
Because I think our captain's a very conscientious man.
I find his conduct un-English.
Downright un-English.
Weigh anchor, Mr. Arrow.
All hands on deck! Man the windlass!
Fall the topsail!
Anchors aweigh, sir!
Aloft there! Overhaul the buntline!
Well, Captain, what do you say about our crew now?
Oh, they're seamen of sorts, sir.
A shade better than Lord Mayor's men, and no worse than dock-wallopers brought aboard by the press-gang.
- Mr. Arrow, brace your foreyard!
- Aye, aye, sir.
Lee fore brace!
Avast!
Avast!
- Mr. Arrow.
- Concealed weapon, sir.
Bring that man aft.
- What's your name?
- George Merry, sir.
I suppose you sailed with Admiral Hawke, too?
Aye, sir. Master gunner.
You brought your own cannon aboard?
Men accustomed to warfare do arm themselves.
Not when engaged on peaceful, commercial enterprise.
Any further offense, 12 lashes.
And that goes for all the fo'c'sle hands.
- See to it, Mr. Arrow.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Dismissed.
I'll have to turn mine in, too.
Here.
- You ain't let no one see it, have ye?
- No, sir.
Then it would go hard with Long John if you was to turn it in now.
But why?
Well, here's a captain with a suspicious turn of mind, and here's Long John handing out firearms, to an able-bodied seaman like yourself.
But I'd do no harm with it.
- Would you keep it out of sight?
- Yes, sir.
You ain't given to rum drinking, are ye?
Oh, no, sir.
Nor quarrelsome, like some I could name?
I don't want no mate peachin' on me.
You shouldn't have crossed him, George.
Now he can take away our rum ration.
- You knows his reputation.
- And drink it all himself.
Why did you give him the chance, then?
You heard the orders.
Seamen knives is all, and them in full sight.
Well, Israel Hands, here's one he don't get.
Ain't that a beauty, now.
Why, a knife like that'd bring down a gull.
Devil burn ye, John Silver, and don't think ye come that over me.
Time you learn, George Merry, just who is captain aboard this here commercial enterprise.
A captain's was a captain wouldn't have that mate around sticking his nose into fo'c'sle business.
You lay a finger on Mr. Arrow, and you'll answer to me.
Mr. Arrow be a friend of Long John Silver's and I plans to take care of him.
Be that clear, George Merry?
You know, matey, if you and me was worth our salt, we'd think out a way to sweeten Mr. Arrow's disposition.
I knows what'll do him.
- Plum duff.
- Oh, my mother made that!
Tasted proper on a cold night, didn't it?
Did your mother ever put a drop of rum in it?
Good and strong, so the smell went up your nose.
Aye, it's too bad we ain't got none.
Plum duff ain't no better than bilge water without rum.
Can't you get rum for cooking?
And have Captain suspect me of sneaking double grog?
I could ask Squire for some.
Without Captain knowing?
I'm sure I could.
Blow me down, so ye could.
You have an egress and regress to the gentlemen in the cabin, but, uh, can you keep that many secrets?
Aye, aye, sir.
You're a good 'un, Jim.
I seen that from the start.
A-yo, ho, ho and a bottle of rum
Starboard watch on deck!
Starboard watch on deck!
Starboard watch on deck!
Mr. Arrow?
Could ye spare a minute afore you go topside again?
Plum duff. I made it special for you, sir.
And that's what gives it the flavor.
Sweeten to suit your taste.
Right there, you big monkey.
You'll need your sea legs up there tonight, sir.
Have ye forgot, George?
I'm the one what's taking care of Mr. Arrow.
And it shall be entered in the log that Mr. Arrow, mate on the Hispaniola was washed overboard in a storm on the night of May 14, and his body not recovered for burial.
Unto Almighty God we commend the soul of our brother departed and commit his body to the deep.
Amen.
Do you think we'll ever sight land again?
- We will.
- When?
Ooh, there are signs.
What signs?
Sailors' vapors, mostly.
Crew always gets quarrelsome towards the end of a voyage when all the beer's gone and the water keg's crawling and all you've got left is salt pork and boiled beans, and boiled beans and salt pork.
There's a few apples left.
And when the last apple's et, we'll sight land.
- Then I'm going to eat 'em all up.
- Good.
- Hey, fetch me one.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- What do you think, George?
- We can take this ship right now.
- Then what are we waiting for?
- That's what I wants to know.
Since me and Norton joined you, the only crew left on Captain's side is Gray and Joyce and Hunter.
And I say, cut their throats!
And I say there'll be no killing till I give the word.
What's come over you, John?
When you were sailing with Flint, it was cut and rip.
John's gone too genteel for bloodletting.
You thickheaded swab!
Who got rid of Arrow so quiet that no one suspected?
Not even young Hawkins, who brought be the rum for the job.
And who'll get ye firearms in the same way when the time comes?
Nobody's crossing you, John, but we still would like to know what we're waitin' for.
We're waiting while a first-class navigator like Captain Smollett sails this here bumboat to our destination.
We can steer a course, but who's to set one?
You'll get plenty of cut and rip when the time comes.
But until I gives the signal, lay to.
Well, we'll wait, but it won't be easy.
Well, I want some pickles and wine and a mouthful of rum, I do.
When a thirst is on ye, bite into a pippin real savage.
- It staves off the desire.
- Land ho!
Land ho!
Long John Silver. I just can't believe it.
I'd never have questioned his loyalty.
Everything he told us was a lie.
I've been a fool, sir.
You're not the only one, lad.
Captain Smollett, I own myself an ass.
- You were right, I was wrong.
- No more wrong than I, Squire.
I'm the man that signed Scully and Norton and they've turned against me.
Precious few of us left now.
Counting Joyce, Gray, Hunter,
Redruth, Williams, that makes us eight. Nine.
Nine against 20? Pretty heavy odds.
We have all the firearms.
Can't we surprise them?
That's my plan when I get them all ashore.
Did Silver give any hint when he meant to start the mutiny?
No, sir.
Well, here's my view.
We've got time ahead of us, at least till we find the treasure.
Yes, but can Silver keep his men in check that long?
If he can hold them back for 24 hours,
I'll have every one of the mutinous dogs in irons.
Well, here's our course. Lay to, and give them no cause for alarm, otherwise they'd strike at once.
In the meantime, we'll arm the faithful hands and keep a sharp lookout for them.
If you hear any murmurs against Silver, report to me.
Jim warned us once.
I wonder if he could do it again.
Jim, could you play a part you don't feel?
Keep your ears open, and stay friends with Silver?
Stay friends with him?
Yes, sir. I'll stay friends with him.
'Tis a sweet spot for a young lad ashore.
You'll climb trees and hunt goats, you will.
And when you've a mind to do a bit of explorin', just you ask ol' John, and he'll put up a bit of grub for ye to take along.
What's come over ye, lad?
Cat got your tongue?
All hands.
Any of you seen that land before?
I have, sir.
I was cook on a trader that watered here.
- Where's the anchorage?
- Yonder, sir, through that inlet.
- Can it be entered at low tide?
- Aye.
There's a kind of passage been dug there in a manner of speaking, by nature.
You give me a strong pull with a long boat, sir, and I'll guide her in like a lamb.
Good. Stand by to lower the boats.
Can I come along in the boat?
- Captain Smollett?
- Yes?
Young Hawkins here wants to try his hand on a tiller.
Permission granted.
Now that we've got here, what are we waiting for?
We're waiting till
I decide the time be right.
Be that plain enough, George Merry?
Lower away.
- You're to have the helm, ain't you?
- Aye.
- See Redruth on guard there?
- Aye.
When I give ye the signal, jump on him so's we can rush the aft cabin and get them muskets.
Cast off your forward lines.
Stand by to weigh anchor.
Five fathoms!
Good anchorage here, sir.
- Ready to drop anchor.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Rush him!
- Boys, get on deck fast!
Belay! Lay to!
Get below, you scum. Double quick.
Get down. Get down.
- Lash down the hatch.
- Now we're for it.
Cast off the lines and pull for the shore. Lively!
None of that, my men. Turn about.
Come alongside.
Fire that musket, and I cuts his throat.
Merry, you blundering squid.
Can you hear me?
Aye, I hear ye.
Lie low till a treaty be made.
And this time, follow orders.
As for you, Mr. Smollett,
I'll give ye one hour to send a boat ashore with Flint's map and give yourself up to Mr. Merry.
So be it if you want to see young Hawkins alive.
Pull for the shore. Lively!
By Jove, sir, we've got to save that boy.
Now then, matey, don't ye take it so hard.
Why, it is lucky you came along, or old John here, he'd have had nothing to bargain with.
But that don't mean I'd harm a hair of your little head.
Liar! You let go of me.
There, now, see? Here, here!
Come back here.
- Come here, you.
- After him, you swabs.
Come on! Go on! Go on!
Come on! There he goes.
After him! After him!
- Which way, Scully?
- Pipe down. I thought I heard him.
A hang good job of sighting you did.
Ah, he must have doubled back.
Beat to the woods, mates.
After him!
No, no, no! Don't shoot!
You wouldn't harm Ben Gunn?
Poor Ben Gunn, I am.
And I haven't spoke with a Christian these five years.
Five years! Were you shipwrecked?
Nay, mate. Marooned.
Tell me, mate, would that be Flint's ship?
No, Flint's dead.
The master of that ship's a gentleman, Captain Smollett.
"Gentleman, " says you.
"Flint's men, " says I.
I've seen 'em.
Some of them are Flint's men, but they got aboard by a trick.
Is there a man with one leg among 'em?
- Long John Silver.
- Nay, if you were sent by him
I'm as good as pork, and I knows it.
No, you don't understand.
He's trying to take me as hostage.
I hate John Silver.
"And fear him, too," says you.
Everybody feared Flint's quartermaster.
It was him has marooned me here.
I ain't had a mouthful of Christian diet these five years.
Marooned five years!
And lived on goats and berries.
Many is the night
I dreamed of cheese.
Toasted, mostly.
You wouldn't have a rind of cheese about you, would you, now?
There's cheese by the hundredweight aboard ship.
Now, if you could help me row a long boat...
"Boat, " says you.
"Ben Gunn's your man, " says I.
What might ye call yourself, mate?
- Jim.
- Jim.
Jim. Well, now, Jim, you just follow Ben Gunn.
A little more west, sir.
There it is.
With that stockade as a base for our operations ashore we stand a better chance of rescuing that boy.
That's all.
Keep a sharp watch, one stem, the other stern.
- You'll be relieved in good time.
- Let us out of here, you dogs!
Don't be afraid of those bilge rats, but don't underestimate them either.
Shove off.
Made it with me own hands out of bamboo and goatskins, mostly.
"And a trim little craft," says you.
- Will she hold us both?
- That she will.
"But first, " says you, "we'll see if the coast is clear of Flint's men."
No sign of 'em.
Look! The jolly boat!
They're coming for me!
Let us out of here, you dogs!
Open up, you swab!
Let us out of here!
Open the hatches!
Come on. Let us out of prison!
Stop that, or I fires.
Break! Break!
Pull, boys. Pull for the shore.
Stop that!
Blast away!
Blasted!
Aye! Ahoy there.
Now we'll all be marooned.
Aye, we can give that captain a proper welcome ashore.
Avast. Pay no heed to them. Make for the ship. We want them muskets.
- Captain...
- No, no, matey.
- Do you want John Silver to hear us?
- But Captain won't know where I went.
No need to. Ben Gunn knows where your captain's headed for.
There be your friends, sure enough.
Come on. Come along.
If your captain wants to see Ben Gunn, tell him to come tonight, alone, to the top of Spy Glass Hill.
I'll tell him.
And tell him them as hides can find, and them as finds can hide!
Yo, ho, ho and a bottle of rum
Give me the full one, George.
Yo, ho, ho and a bottle of rum
Changed your quarters, have ye, George?
Aye. I took the ship for you, didn't I?
- I can't remember asking ye.
- You said when the time was right.
Clap him in irons.
Clap him in irons!
I'll carry out your orders, John, but I'm speakin' in open council for you to give George Merry another chance.
George here ain't the one to lay plans, but if you aims to take this stockade, well, George is a good man in a fight.
Too good to be rotting down below.
- That's right, John.
- That's right, John.
That's very civil spoke, Israel Hands.
And now we'll put it to Mr. Merry, if I'm to take any more of his sauce.
- I'm with ya, Captain.
- Aye, aye, Captain.
All right, then.
If I'm captain, then this is orders.
All hands ashore except Israel and Haggott here.
The two of you remain on board and guard the ship.
Aye, aye, sir.
If you're in trouble, you can signal me by firing the cannon.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- And when you're doing sentry, though, just ease off a point on the rum.
Hear that, Haggott?
Now, which is it, drink or fight?
Fight! Fight!
Then would you say, Jim, from what you saw of this Ben Gunn, is he sane?
Well, yes, I shouldn't wonder.
A man who's been biting his nails for years on a desert island can't be expected to appear as sane as you or I.
Why did he want you to come after dark, Captain?
Safety, of course. But frankly,
I've no craving for his company.
If he knows as much about the island as he says he does, I may pay him a visit.
Later, perhaps. Right now, we may expect visitors ourselves.
- Can you load, Jim Hawkins?
- Yes, sir.
Good. When they come, we must have their rations ready.
Let them come, by Jove.
They'll find me ready.
Once I've had my brandy.
Quarters!
Flag of truce!
Hold your positions.
I'll go and have a look.
Flag of truce!
What do you want with your flag of truce?
Captain Silver to come aboard and make terms.
Captain Silver? Who's he?
Me, sir. These poor lads here have chosen me captain after your desertion, sir.
My man, I've got no desire to talk to you.
But if you want to talk to me, you can come aboard.
There'll be no treachery, unless it's on your side.
The word of a gentleman be good enough for Long John.
It may be a trick.
Gray, Joyce, Hunter, keep stations!
That's far enough. Sit down.
Very well, sir, but one of you'll have to give me a leg up again.
A sweet, pretty place you have here, to be sure.
And there's Jim. How be my little matey?
And Squire and Doctor.
My service to ye, gentlemen.
If you've anything to say, you'd better say it.
You're right, Captain.
Well, the long and the short of it be this.
I want Flint's map, and I can risk half my crew to get it.
But that ain't Captain Silver's way.
"Try reasoning first," says I.
I never was one to see poor seamen shot down needless like.
You are not in Parliament yet,
John Silver. Come to the point.
You're a good man, Doctor.
I've never seen a better.
And I'd hate to see the likes of you skewered on the end of a pike.
So here be my terms.
You give us that there map and you can stay here and keep your lives.
We'll divide stores with ye, man to man, and I gives you my affidavit to stop the first ship I sight and send 'em here to pick you up.
- Your word, Silver?
- Handsomer you couldn't ask.
And I hopes all gentlemen present will over all my words, for what be said to one be said to all.
- Is that all?
- Every last word, by thunder!
Very good. Now hear my terms.
If you come up here, one by one, unarmed,
I'll engage to clap you all in irons and take you home to a fair trial in England.
You can't find the treasure.
You can't sail a ship.
And your cowardly scum can't fight.
Now, bundle out of here, double quick.
- Give me a hand up, will ye?
- Not I.
Who'll give me a hand, I say.
So be it!
But 'fore an hour's out, you'll be begging help from me.
Them that die'll be the lucky ones!
Truce be over!
Cutlasses, you swabs!
They've opened fire here from the east.
They'll board from all sides at once.
Slash them down!
Burn 'em, boys, burn 'em!
Burn 'em, you swabs.
Musket.
Out, lads. Fight in the open.
Keep those muskets loaded. Here.
Cut that captain down!
They're on the run.
Take cover before they reload.
Come back here, you lubberly Turks.
Oh, for 10 toes!
- Quick, Doctor!
- Bar the door.
Jim, my case. My case.
Think they'll attack again?
I don't know, Jim.
It's hard to foresee the end of this.
Jim, take this map. I want you to have it.
Just a precaution.
It's yours by right, you know.
And if the worst comes to the worst, don't hesitate to buy your life with it.
Water.
How many of them fell?
Five or six at least, that I know of.
Better odds now. They won't drive us out of here in a hurry.
- They may not try to.
- Why not?
At flood tide tomorrow, nothing's to hinder them from bringing the ship close in shore.
Once within cannon range, they could level this fort.
- By Jove, I hadn't thought of that.
- Will they think of it?
Silver might, blast him!
They've got all the boats.
Otherwise, we could slip out, cut the hawser, and the ship might beach herself.
- I could swim for it, sir.
- Can't spare you.
Just nuisance firing, that's all.
You heard what he said!
Ease off a point on the rum!
- No, you don't.
- But I want my ration and none of your sour looks neither.
Stand clear of that rum.
You'll get no more till we're relieved.
And if you don't keep off it,
I'll fire that cannon and get a proper watch aboard.
- Oh, will ya?
- Yeah!
So it was you had Flint's map.
- Not another step.
- Jim.
Jim.
I reckon I'll have to strike my colors.
That comes hard from a master mariner to a...
To a ship's younker like you, Jim.
But you're like Silver said, smart as paint.
One more step, Mr. Hands, and I'll blow your brains out.
Now, now, matey.
Matey.
Dr. Livesy?
Dr. Livesy.
Doctor?
Matey.
Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight!
- Pipe down!
- Aye, 'tis the cabin boy.
Someone's pinked him, for certain.
Blood poisoning, I shouldn't doubt.
Save me cutting your throat, you little swab.
- Avast, George Merry.
- Avast, is it?
Little matey, is it?
Maybe a touch of this here would show
Master Hawkins which side he were on.
And some others I could name.
Maybe you thought you was captain here.
Fetch the water bucket!
I don't have to be captain to know my rights.
And askin' your pardon, this here crew would lay a sight more confidence in a captain as allowed us our say about enemy prisoners.
Prisoners be one thing, hostages another.
We has the ship. We has the fort.
What good is a hostage, and him bad hurt?
Why, you knot head.
With him bad hurt, they'll part with the map to save his life.
We'll hoist the flag of truce and hail that doctor.
Or would any man jack of ye care to give me an argument to the contrary?
So that's your sort, is it?
You're great hands to talk, you are.
But when it comes to fightin', that boy there be a better man than any two of you.
Before this crew takes anymore orders from you, Long John, we claims our rights to step outside for a council.
- According to rules.
- Let's go, council.
You! What are you doing here?
Doctor? Squire?
They gave us the slip last night, matey.
When we walked in here, they was gone.
Now you lay still.
You're going to be cared for proper.
Old John will fetch that doctor here.
Flag of truce!
Ahoy!
Doctor?
We have Jim Hawkins!
Ahoy!
Doctor!
Ahoy!
Step up, lad. I won't hurt no member of a deputation.
The black spot! Well, shiver my timbers.
What be this?
This here was cut from a Bible.
- What fools cut a Bible?
- What did I say?
- "No good'll come of that," I said.
- Was it you, Job Anderson?
Now Job can say his prayers.
He's had his slice of luck, Job has.
- Cut a Bible! You'll all swing now.
- Belay that talk, John Silver.
This crew has tipped you the black spot in full council.
The rules is, you turn it over in duty bound, and see what's wrote there.
Thank ye, George.
You always was brisk for business.
"Deposed." And very pretty wrote.
Your handwriting, George?
You're getting quite a leading hand in this here crew.
You'll be captain next,
I shouldn't wonder.
You can't fool this crew no more, John Silver.
Step down off your perch and vote.
John Silver!
There'll be no voting till the business of this here map be disposed of.
Till then I'm still captain, and your black spot ain't worth a biscuit.
Map or no map, we ain't givin' up no hostage till we lays hands on the treasure itself.
Am I right, mates?
How ye going to find that treasure without the map?
Silver!
- John Silver!
- Top o' the morning, Doctor.
Will ye come aboard and take a look at young Hawkins' wound?
No more of your tricks, Silver.
If Jim Hawkins is there, bring him out.
You want to see that doctor, don't ye, Jim?
If I take ye as far as the stockade, will you give me your affidavit not to slip your cable?
- Word of honor?
- Word of honor.
Right, then.
Stand by here while I parleys with him.
And keep a sharp lookout on all sides.
I'll keep a weather eye out for a man what's trying to get a foot in each camp, and he with only one leg.
You'd better come back with that map and the hostage, Captain Silver!
Doctor!
Steady, lad. Steady, Jim.
Aye, he's had a rum go of it, sir.
- Taking to knifing boys, eh, Silver?
- Not me, sir.
Why, if it hadn't been for Long John, he'd have had his throat cut.
Bite hard on that bullet, Jim.
This will have to be opened.
You could cut my good leg off 'fore I'd raise a finger against that there lad.
Why, when he comes crawling into the fort half dead, I says to myself,
"You've got to save that dear boy, John."
Captain would wish it,
Squire would wish it and you'd wish it.
So Captain Silver is minded to join us again, eh?
I'll be honest and open with you, as I always am.
When I climbed the fort and seen the Hispaniola flying that Union Jack,
I knew I'd been taught a lesson by my betters.
I thinks gold dust of this dear boy.
I've took to him like pitch.
You'd have killed me yourself if you'd had that map.
But you'll not get it. I'd die first.
You're a mite late to talk of dying.
No, old John, he ain't human, he ain't.
He didn't care about saving his little matey's life, not him.
- All he wanted was this here map.
- Very well. You have the map.
But what good is the treasure without a ship to haul it?
And what good be a ship if 'tis only to haul me to execution, Doc?
I be no coward, Doctor, but the thought of them there gallows gives me the shakes.
Now, if I was to save young Hawkins' life, do ye think ye could save mine into the bargain?
- You save him?
- I could guard the boy while I plays at treasure hunting with them scum.
But they'll not give him up till they sees the treasure dug.
Now, wouldn't that warrant a good word to the captain?
- I want to speak with the boy alone.
- Speak and welcome, and make a note of that, too, but go on with your doctoring while you talks.
One false move, and they'll fire.
Jim, I don't know how you managed to save us that ship.
- But I lost the map.
- The map's not important to us now, but your safety is.
So you're not going back to those fellows. Now, listen carefully.
I'll make a quick break to draw their fire.
The moment I do, you fall flat.
Then before they've time to reload, you're up and running and we both head for the woods. Right?
- I can't!
- Why not?
I gave Long John my word.
They'd have killed me if it hadn't been for him.
Perhaps you're right, Jim.
Silver!
I want to give you one piece of advice.
Stay close to that boy, and this I promise you, if we get out of this wolf trap alive,
I'll do my best to save you, short of perjury.
You couldn't say more, not if you was my mother.
Heaven forbid! Good luck, Jim.
- It's the map!
- By Jove, he's got it!
And now, by thunder, I resign.
Elect anyone you please to be your captain.
I've done with ye.
- No, no!
- John Silver for me, yeah!
Take it back, George Merry, and tear it up.
Put it back in the good book, mate.
Poor roving seamen, the likes of you needs every scrap of scripture he can get.
Mind what I say, Master Hawkins and don't try to fly the coop again.
Appearances, matey, appearances.
March now, you little spritsail.
To Finger Trunk Tree by Devil's Rock bearing a point to the north of north-northeast.
There she be!
Come on!
Hey! Now, who might that be?
He were a seaman, all right.
- Leastways, this be good sea cloth.
- Like enough.
You wouldn't look to find a bishop here.
- What did he die of, I want to know?
- He died of Flint's hand, as did five other men Flint took ashore.
That would be Darby McGraw.
- Mind old Darby, Morgan?
- Aye, I mind him.
Owed me money, he did.
I don't like the way he's stretched out.
Ain't natural. Ain't nice.
I've a notion. Where's that map?
As I thought. Right in line!
By thunder! It makes me go cold inside to think of Flint.
This one he hauled here and laid down by compass to point the way to the doubloons.
Fetch ahead now!
There it is!
Where is it?
It's gone!
Gone? Dig!
Rip it up, you swabs!
Stand by for trouble.
One dirty guinea! There's your £700,000!
Hardly worth dividing, is it, George?
So you did make a bargain with the doctor!
Look at his face, mates!
You can see it wrote on his face!
Be you standing for captain again?
Aah!
- Dr. Livesy!
- Jim, are you all right?
Thank ye kindly, Doctor.
You came in the nick of time for Hawkins and...
Ben Gunn.
How do, Mr. Silver? "Pretty well,
I thank ye," says you.
Ben, to think 'twas you that done me.
"What happened to Flint's gold?" says you.
"Ben Gunn's cave," says I.
Them as hides can find, Mr. Silver.
"But not when them that finds has hid it," says I.
John Silver! Now what have you got to say for yourself?
Well, sir, by your leave, sir,
John Silver's come back to do his duty.
Hmm.
And happy I am to think, sir, that I had some small hand in saving young Master Hawkins when he was within half a plank of death.
And does that clear you of the crime of mutiny?
Please, sir, he did save my life.
Jim's right.
Silver kept his side of the bargain.
Then you're both free to testify on his behalf.
He'll have a fair trial in England.
Squire Trelawney, while the doctor's helping me down to the beach,
I suggest you get a load aboard the ship.
Take John Silver along and put him in irons.
Aye, aye, sir.
Now, then, Silver, none of your monkeyshines.
Jim, lad, would ye do a favor for your old shipmate?
Would ye take Captain Flint?
I've tried caging her before, but this old bird, she can't abide a prison.
There ain't much in nature as can.
I couldn't, Long John. I'd like it, but I fear she'd just remind me...
Well, no matter, though I'd dearly love to leave you a trinket to a lad I respect.
All right, Silver, enough of that.
Beggin' your pardon, Squire, you should caulk her while she's heeled over.
Jump now, and swim for it.
And you, too, Squire.
Why, if you think that you...
If I may make so bold, sir,
I'll borrow your boat, but I ain't takin' you to Jamaica.
- Lively, now!
- You monster!
Heads up! I can't swim so far!
My service to you, Squire.
Might be as you care to float.
Belay!
You steer me a true course through the channel and I'll put ye off on yon spit of land.
Hey! Hey there, avast!
- Shove me off!
- I'll take no orders from you.
You put me on here.
Now you'll shove me off or by the powers, you'll get what I gave George Merry.
- Hurry, Livesy!
- Coming, Squire.
Shoulder to it, Jim.
That's it!
Shove her nose out.
Thank ye, Jim. I might have known you'd never let 'em hang your old shipmate.
Pull out. Pull back. Overhaul him.
Harder.
Ah, well, the sharks may do for him yet.
Goodbye, matey! Good luck to ye!
Blast him. I could almost find it in my heart to hope he makes it.
The island of Santa Marta is not very much different...
from any of the other smaller islands in the Caribbean.
Towering mountains, white gold beaches...
coconut palms and hot tropical sun.
It has a population of about 100,000...
9/10ths of it colored or of mixed blood.
Its main industry is raising sugar, copra, cocoa...
and exporting them.
Originally a French Island...
its laborers were brought in slave ships from the Gold Coast of Africa...
four and a half centuries ago.
And now it is a British Crown Colony.
Well, that about sums up all the facts you'll find... in the tourist guides,
Mr. Bradshaw.
Of course, as a journalist, you'll want to see as much of our island as possible.
If you're in doubt about anything, get in touch with Colonel Whittingham here.
Nothing like being on the right side of the police, eh, Colonel?
- Quite so.
- Denis.
- Sir?
- Have you arranged for Mr. Bradshaw's hotel?
- The St. James.
- Good. Very comfortable, the St. James.
- Excellent bar.
- I don't drink, sir.
- Oh.
- Doctor's orders.
Pity.
- Well, we'll be seeing you this afternoon at the reception.
- Thank you, Your Excellency.
Oh, Your Excellency, just one more question.
I'm very interested in the new constitution that's being given to the islands.
Do you think the West Indian is ready to govern himself?
When you get to know the island better, Mr. Bradshaw...
I shall be glad to discuss it with you.
Good day, sir.
Is there much discontent in the islands, Colonel?
Crime's my business,
Mr. Bradshaw, not politics.
Sylvia?
Sylvia.
Sylvia?
Sylvia?
- Bye, Mavis. See you later.
- Bye.
- Want some help?
- Yes.
Well, call somebody.
Maxwell, how nice.
I didn't expect you until later.
- I won't be a minute.
- I'll wait.
Please, dear.
I'm hot and sticky.
- Did you see your father?
- We lunched at the club.
Mother's coming back tomorrow from Barbados.
My sister tell you?
- Oh, there you are.
- Here are the towels.
Thanks, dear.
Well, I'm off for a shower.
Tell Mavis we'll see her at H.E.'s party.
Okay.
- How was the beach?
- Oh, fun.
- Anybody there I know?
- Oh, you know, the usual bunch.
What time's the party at Government House?
The invitation said 5:30.
- Anything wrong?
- What?
Well, you've a very odd look.
You haven't changed to smoking Egyptian cigarettes, have you?
- No. Why?
- You better run along.
You gonna meet Mother at the plane tomorrow?
No, Daddy's going.
Why don't you go with him?
- She'd prefer to have you.
- Well-
- Tell Sylvia that I'll see her later.
- Mm-hmm.
- Is that you, darling?
- Yes.
We'll have to hurry.
What time did the invitation say?
5:30. Do we have to go?
- I'd rather stay out here at Belfontaine.
- We can't very well not go.
After all, it's protocol.
Besides, it's a party to welcome
Lord Templeton's only son and heir.
- What's his name?
- Who?
- The governor's son.
- Euan, I think.
I saw his picture in the Tatler.
Pass me a tissue, would you, darling?
He's been stationed in the Middle East for the last 18 months.
This will be a holiday for him.
He's going up to Oxford in the autumn.
You seem to know a great deal about him.
Well, you know the island.
A male-young, white, unmarried, titled and comparatively rich-
Good heavens. What else do you think the girls would talk about?
- Darling, you're not jealous, are you?
- A bit.
- Whatever of?
- Anybody with all those virtues.
That's the penalty for being so much in love with you.
That's sweet.
Anybody out at the house today?
- Out at the house?
- While I was in town.
No, not that I know of.
- Why?
- I just wondered.
Darling, you must get dressed.
We'll never get to the party.
Mrs. de Voeux.
Mrs. de Voeux is matron of our hospital.
Her son also captains our best cricket team.
My son, Euan.
I know exactly how young Templeton feels.
Eighteen months military duty in the Middle East.
Desert, fleas, not a woman in miles.
How do you do?
How are you?
No need for you to stand guard, my boy.
I'll hold the fort.
You start campaigning.
Thank you, sir.
Oh, no, no. I can't go in.
I haven't been invited.
I can't crash a party at Government House.
But you can... if you're with David Boyeur.
I'll say you're my cousin.
What difference does it make?
It makes a difference to me.
If I go in, I go in as Margot Seaton.
If I have to leave,
I'll leave as Margot Seaton.
That's all right with me, if that's the way you want it.
Well, it may get you into trouble with the governor.
Me? Trouble with the governor?
Templeton needs me much more than I need him.
Do you really want me to go?
Yes, I do. You're an idiot to be afraid of those people up there.
What for?
Do you mind getting out of the driveway?
We're going in.
All right.
But I warn you, you may regret it.
What do representative girls in their early 20s... drink at the beach in Santa Marta, Colonel?
- Rum swizzles, I believe.
- Rum swizzles?
Tomorrow afternoon then?
With a thermos full of rum swizzles.
Excuse me.
There's my father.
Ah, there you are.
I was beginning to think my secretary had forgotten to invite you.
- Your Excellency, Miss Margot Seaton.
- How do you do?
Will you excuse me?
There's an American journalist here I'd like you to meet.
I'm sure you've explained how dangerous I am.
Of course.
Our homegrown revolutionary.
The press is a nuisance, but it exists.
And I believe in cooperating with what exists.
I'm Denis Archer, the governor's aide.
How is it I haven't seen you before?
Maybe it's because you buy your toothpaste at the wrong drugstore.
What should I take that to mean?
- I work at the Bon Marche drugstore.
- Oh.
In that case,
I shall change my patronage.
You're wondering what I'm doing here, aren't you?
- Well, uh-
- Well, I wasn't invited.
Uh, David Boyeur dared me to come.
I don't like being dared.
I see.
Next time I shall see that you're properly invited.
- The colonel's been telling me about David Boyeur.
- Oh, has he?
Yes. There's a man with real power.
Notice the very special treatment His Excellency's giving him.
Strange. In all the years
I've lived on this island, I've never met him.
Oh, I have.
He used to work in the kitchens... at the St. James Hotel when we used to live there.
And I was very, very young.
- He's gone far since then.
- Too far.
- Why don't you take up Boyeur's challenge?
- What do you mean?
With this new constitution,
Boyeur's going to try and capture... the legislature at the next general election.
Seems to me some of you planters should go in for politics, and rather quickly.
Fight him at the polls.
Stand for election.
- Me?
- Yes. Why not you?
The Fleury name means a great deal on the island.
Everyone respects your father, even the West-
You'd stand an excellent chance of winning.
Do you often smoke these?
Only on special occasions.
They're Egyptian, aren't they?
Yes, I had them made for me in Cairo.
They're very difficult to get here.
My childhood wasn't very much different... from any of the other children who I grew up with.
It was always the same story.
Rum and ginger, please.
No opportunity for anything.
No one to tell, pay any attention.
That's when I began organizing.
One of the most important fights is against tradition.
This island's shackled with traditions.
- Would you agree with that, Mr. Fleury?
- What?
Mr. Boyeur here says he thinks the island is bound with tradition.
What would Mr. Boyeur have us do? Forget them?
Mr. Fleury speaks as if traditions belong only to him. We have ours too.
I'd be the last to deny him his traditions.
Which ones, Mr. Fleury?
The ones we got on the slave ships?
Or in the cane fields working like beasts?
Or the ones we have now- the ones we are making every day... despite the slave ships and the cane fields.
No, Mr. Bradshaw, we don't intend to live the way our fathers did.
Your father, if I remember correctly... worked on my father's plantation.
- Till the day he died.
- He was well taken care of- whether he was sick or not, whether he worked or not.
That was charity, Mr. Fleury.
What we want is equality.
What I want is a drink.
How about you, Maxwell?
No, I won't have one.
Uh, this- this headache.
- Do you mind if we go?
- Now? But we've only just arrived.
We're all going down to the club later.
I told Sylvia
I wasn't up to this party.
We can be social some other time.
Will you excuse us?
Mavis, Mr. Bradshaw, Colonel.
It's good to see you, David Boyeur.
It's nice seeing you again, Miss Norman.
- It's been a long time.
- Yes.
As a matter of fact, you were 12 years old at the time.
It was a party given for the children out at St. James lawn.
- And you won a prize.
- Oh, I did? What for?
The obstacle race.
I haven't been much of a prizewinner since.
As a matter of fact, I remember watching you from the kitchen window.
It wasn't much of a prize.
Lamb's tales from Shakespeare.
You've won bigger.
Perhaps.
Oh, excuse me.
Just one more question, Mr. Boyeur.
What would you say is the most important problem on the island?
Color, Mr. Bradshaw. Color.
Would you excuse me?
We'd better take the sea road.
Aren't you coming?
I feel like staying here for a while.
Beautiful night, don't you think?
What sort of a mood are you in now?
So you and your friend Carson think I ought to go into politics?
I think what you did at the party was stupid... deliberately insulting
David Boyeur that way.
- He can be dangerous.
- So can I.
Forget Boyeur. Let's talk about Carson.
He's interesting, don't you think?
War record. Bachelor.
The sort of thing that women go for.
- Hilary's nice.
- If I were a woman...
I'd prefer Carson to Euan Templeton.
But it was Euan all the girls chased after.
Too bad you can't try your luck with him.
I know you.
You envy Jocelyn, or any other girl who's free, because you wish you were.
That's true, isn't it?
Maxwell, stop it.
You'll tear my dress.
Do you know,
I've never torn a dress of yours.
- Take me home.
- Home?
Women get bored making love in the same room.
A change of scenery helps.
Stop it.
Tell me about Egypt.
Was it madly dull?
Too many pyramids.
And not enough girls?
None to write home about.
Do you think there'll be any punch left in that thermos?
Mm-hmm.
- Cold enough?
- Uh-huh.
What's your life like here? Gay?
Not very.
This is a small island, and there's a dozen girls like myself.
And not enough men.
Oh, the boats come in sometimes- tourists, sailors.
Ever think of getting away?
- Constantly.
- Where?
I don't know.
Paris. London.
It doesn't really matter.
You know, you get awfully tired of all this sun.
What will you do when you leave Oxford?
I've got a seat waiting for me in the House of Lords.
Ah, I forgot.
You've a title.
Don't say it like that.
You know, there was a corporal in the army.
He used to take a peculiar pleasure out of reading my name out in full-
"Private the Honorable
Lord Templeton E.J., number 6139."
I suppose it did sound funny.
When I was in Egypt,
I used to lie out on the beach... close my eyes and make a prayer to Allah.
"Please, Allah," I'd say.
"When I open my eyes, may there be a pretty girl lying on the sand next to me.
Thank you, Allah."
Hello.
- I want some toothpaste.
- What kind?
- Any one of those will do.
- The large or the small?
What's the difference in price?
The large is 36.
The small is 24.
I'll- I'll take the large.
Miss Seaton, are you going to the nurses' dance with anyone?
- David Boyeur asked me.
- And if I asked you?
Are you?
I'm afraid he'll have to find someone to take your place.
As a matter of fact, I, uh-
- I have an official invitation here.
- What does it say?
It says, " His Excellency, the Governor, requests the pleasure...
"of Miss Margot Seaton's company at his table... on Tuesday, March the 15th, at 8:00 p.m."
I'll call for you myself.
Oh, you forgot your change.
Rita. Have you finished with my wife yet?
Sorry. Your wife is not here.
She was here early today... but her appointment is for tomorrow.
- Oh, did she say where she was going?
- No.
Darling, I'm sorry.
Have you been waiting long?
I told Maxwell
I'd be at the hairdressers... and then it turned out my appointment wasn't until tomorrow.
Bit of luck your wife ran into me.
Hilary's been awfully sweet.
I insisted he come shopping with me.
Was it very boring?
Well, they say women have only two passions, and one of them's shopping.
- Why did you buy?
- A bikini.
- It's really something, isn't it?
- Right.
You'd better rope off the beach, old man, when she wears it.
We'd better be going.
Lucky shot running into Hilary Carson, wasn't it?
Yes.
- Does he still smoke those cigarettes of his?
- What cigarettes?
You remember those fancy, gold-tipped ones... that he has made up for him in Cairo.
Perhaps that's what I need to be more successful with my own wife- a special brand of tobacco.
I don't know what you're talking-
If I remember, you're a friend of David Boyeur's.
- Yes, I am.
- He's a young man for whom I prophesy a brilliant future.
You must all be very proud of him.
Well, that's what he keeps telling us.
We should be.
Denis tells me you're working at the Bon Marche pharmacy.
- Denis?
- Denis Archer, my A.D.C.
- Oh, yes.
- Confidentially, he's not much of an A.D.C.
You know, odd sort of fellow- writes books.
He's very ambitious.
I like him.
I'm very ambitious too.
I'm a stenographer.
I've been taking shorthand and typing.
I'm a qualified stenographer.
I suppose you haven't a place for me?
Well-
I had no idea you danced so well.
Thank you, Miss Seaton.
Thank you,
Your Excellency.
It's a great honor to dance with the governor, you know.
- Yes. Now I know all about you.
- Oh?
- What did he say?
- Odd fellow-writes books.
Confidentially, you're not a very good A.D.C.
You're too ambitious.
But he likes you.
I'm so sorry.
Excuse me.
Don't go away.
I'll be back.
I won't go away.
So that's the reason you didn't go to the nurses' ball with me, huh?
- I warned you, didn't I?
- About what?
That you might regret making me go to the governor's party.
Aren't you drinking?
You do drink champagne, don't you?
I mean, it's- it's not forbidden to union officials, is it?
No, I don't think so.
All right then.
Come along then.
Champagne goes awfully quickly at parties.
Excuse me, ladies.
Excuse me.
Of course, sir.
Mr. Boyeur is having champagne too.
I was asking the police about you.
- The police?
- Mmm. Colonel Whittingham.
We were sitting at the same table.
What'd the colonel have to say?
Young chap, no background, fighting his way- no idea where he wants to go, except up.
The colonel also seems to think you like the idea of your own importance.
The colonel seems to think.
- What do you think?
- I don't know.
Then why are you trying to find out?
I don't know that either.
Does it make any difference, having an aim in life?
- An aim?
- Not just floating about- tea at 5:00, dinner at 8:00,
Tuesdays at the hairdresser's.
Having- Oh, I used to know the word for it- a- a cause.
That should depend a great deal on the person, I should imagine.
You think I'm rather useless, don't you?
Parasitic- that all women of my kind are.
Oh, no, it's true that we don't know anything- oh, the ground rules for tennis or a recipe for shrimp curry... a- a little charity nursing- but nothing very important.
I wish there were something worthwhile...
I could learn about people, about-
There's a great deal to learn right here on this island... if you really mean it.
Oh, it's beautiful.
Used to be the summerhouse where the governors' wives did their sewing.
I told the governor
I'd like somewhere to do my writing, and, uh-
- Oh, is this what you're writing?
- Yes.
- Is it a novel?
- Sort of.
- What's it about?
- Oh, people and places.
Begins in London, and then goes on to Hong Kong...
Cairo, Malta, the West Indies.
Is that where it ends?
I haven't finished it yet.
May I read it sometime?
- If you really want to.
- Oh, yes, I do.
I tried writing here the night after
I met you at the garden party.
Yes?
I couldn't get a sentence straight.
I just sat here thinking about you.
It's a bad sign.
Is it?
Oh, somewhere, someone once said... that there's always a point at the beginning of a love affair... where a man can draw back, where he's still safe.
Is that what you want to be? Safe?
I've been in love.
Funny, I don't know anything about you.
Well, what would you like to know?
All about you. Everything.
Well, there really isn't very much to tell.
I've lived in these islands all my life.
Trinidad, Fort-de-France, Santa Marta.
Does the gramophone work?
Yes.
Do you want me to play it?
Yes.
Margot, you know
I'm in love with you, don't you?
Yes.
You knew from the first, didn't you?
Yes.
- It's hot.
- Mmm.
- How was the trip?
- Pleasant.
- How is Sylvia?
- Pretty, as always.
- I brought the plantation accounts.
- Thanks.
I've a bit of news.
I've decided to stand for the legislature in the next election.
- Why?
- Why not?
It's no good our sitting around saying the island is going to the dogs... and not doing anything about it, right, Mother?
I wasn't even aware the island was going to the dogs.
Boyeur has got a great deal of influence in your district.
Are you afraid of Boyeur too?
He represents the people, or they think he does.
It amounts to the same thing.
You don't think I have a chance of winning, do you?
- No.
- Well, I do!
I'm not afraid of Boyeur!
I'm not afraid of opposing him!
Is there something to drink?
I'd like a sour.
Right.
Your father and I were talking about taking Jocelyn to England for a while.
It's death for a young girl like her on this island.
She ought to have the chance of meeting the right people, don't you think?
Do you think he'd ever trust me to run the estate single-handed?
Your father felt like that about the election because he was concerned for you...
- what a defeat might mean to you.
- Was he?
I don't remember his ever being concerned about me before.
I can't remember his ever worrying whether or not I went to England... whether I ever had a chance to meet the right people.
All I've ever had is this dreary island.
Ah, now, you're not being fair.
Fair? I'm being truthful.
I know what people say.
I know what people think.
I know what you think. I know what he thinks.
I never lived up to the great Fleury name.
But I might have, if I'd gone to Oxford and Eton like Arthur did.
Many things might have been different.
But instead you sent me to school here with a load of colored brats.
All I ever heard about was Arthur- how well he was doing, what good reports you had.
That's who father cared about.
Elder son, apple of his eye.
- Arthur's dead.
- No, he's not dead. He's alive.
Always will be for him.
And I'll always live in his shadow.
Charming Arthur. Modest Arthur.
And then Arthur dead in the war, a- a hero.
- Maxwell, be quiet, will you?
- All right. Father was kind.
He gave Sylvia and me Belfontaine as a wedding present.
A decaying house out on the God-forsaken tip of the island.
And I'm supposed to be grateful for being Julian Fleury's son.
I'd have been better off if I'd been born black.
Maxwell!
Here's your whiskey sour.
- Care for a drink?
- Love one.
- Give us one of those red ones, will you?
- Oh, look. They want some too.
- All right.
- Here. Want this?
Oh, and here's another little girl.
You come right in and have one.
Here you are. Got that?
And how about these girls?
- And don't forget me.
- Right.
Give us another one, will you?
What was that all about?
There once was a man, don't remember who... drew up 200 different classifications of mixed blood on this island.
Well, the children don't seem to know about it yet, do they?
Not yet.
You've lived here all your life... but I'm sure I'll show you a part of this island that you've never seen.
Come on. Come on.
- Uncle Reilly, how are you?
- Fine.
- Uncle Reilly, this is Miss Mavis.
- Hello.
Hello.
Eaton, Sonny, Antoine.
- This is Miss Norman.
- Hello, Miss Norman.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Good cuttin', huh?
- Yes.
- All right. See you later.
- All right.
Well, they all seem to know you.
That's my business.
I was born in this village.
There's the old schoolhouse.
The roof still leaks, the timber's still rotten.
There'll be a new one there next year.
Back to school!
Well, they're- they're all very proud of David Boyeur.
They'll be prouder.
- Hartford.
- Yes?
What are they singing?
It doesn't have a name, really.
It's a song the tourists never hear.
It's a work chant.
When the catch is bad, it's sad.
And when it's good- well, it's like-
Champagne?
Yo-oh-oh
Yo-oh-oh-oh
Yo-oh-oh-oh
Yo-oh-oh, yo-oh-oh-oh
Yo-oh-oh
They're making masks for the carnival.
You should really see them then in the little towns.
Carnival. Carnival. Carnival.
Carnival. Carnival.
Carnival. Carnival.
Is carnival always like this?
- They're drunk with the music.
- Well, let's get out of this madhouse.
Sylvia and Maxwell are staying in town.
The key should be in a flowerpot on the veranda.
I suppose the servants are all in the village running mask.
Can you smell the damp?
No wonder nothing lasts here.
The worms eat right through the furniture.
How about some tea?
That's a very good idea.
Sylvia's very wasteful.
We'll probably find a cake... going quietly stale in the bread bin.
Oh, would you mind opening the shutters and letting some air in?
Yeah.
I think we should go.
I'll put the key back.
I hate leaving here.
Your brother's very lucky to have a place like this all his own.
Ready?
Oh, would you like me to drive?
It's Maxwell's car.
It's got its idiosyncrasies, and I know them.
I suppose that's one of them.
You wait. It's got others.
Let me see.
Just a moment.
Well, now. I hate to tell you this, but your rotor arm's gone.
- What?
- Your rotor arm.
- That's impossible.
- Well, come and look.
It's been taken out.
Is this a carnival idea of humor?
It's somebody's idea of something.
What do you think we should do now?
Telephone your father?
I think we'd better.
No reply?
Try again. It's carnival.
The girl on the exchange may be on a jag.
The line's dead.
It's all right here.
No electricity, the rotor arm gone, and now this.
Three times can't be a coincidence.
What do you mean?
Grudges get paid off at carnival.
Against you, me... or my father?
It's Maxwell's car.
It's Maxwell's house now too.
- What's that?
- Drums, in the village.
They carry for miles.
We need a drink.
Yes, we do, don't we?
Won't they worry at your father's?
No, it's carnival.
They won't expect me for hours.
I think the moon's up.
Shall we have a look at it?
What if we can't get back?
Well, the servants will be here in the morning.
I can send one of them to telephone from the police station.
At least I'm not in Egypt.
Hungry?
I noticed half a chicken pie in the icebox.
Really?
We might as well have supper.
By moonlight.
What about rooms?
Rooms?
If they don't come for us, we shall have to stay.
Any particular one you prefer?
Why don't we toss a coin?
Heads?
Heads it is.
Which?
The one on the right.
I've never slept in it, and I've always wanted to ever since I was a child.
It has a lovely view.
There's a clock on the mantelpiece and a picture between the bookshelves.
And I promised myself I'd sleep in it on my 17 th birthday... but I never have, not once.
Wasn't it lucky I won the toss?
Well, I suppose there's bound to be some sort of gossip.
- Why?
- Oh, my dear... you can hardly expect them not to with such a wonderful opportunity.
- Euan slept in the-
- I'm quite sure that Euan was a gentleman.
I was simply concerned with the thought...
that Lord Templeton might find himself involved in unpleasantness.
- Mrs. Fleury?
- Mmm?
I wonder if you'd be kind enough to give me an opinion.
Do you think it would be a good idea for someone like myself to be married here, or in England?
Why, I don't quite know.
I think England might be quite nice, but it might be more fun here.
You know, it'd be a sort of holiday, another carnival, sort of.
Euan, you know you don't have to.
This isn't England, and Mother isn't Queen Victoria.
Well, what am I supposed to tell my father?
- Your father?
- Yes.
I spoke to him on the phone, and I said-
You are, aren't you?
I am what?
In love with me?
Because that's what
I told my father on the-
I mean, I- I said I was in love with you, and I- I assumed you were with me.
What did he say?
Couldn't wish me a happier fate.
- You know, it's not 24 hours since we drove to Belfontaine.
- I know.
You were going to Oxford.
This was just a short vacation.
Marriage isn't what you want, Euan.
Well, it's true that when
I first came here...
I wasn't sort of looking for anything that went deep.
No, a good time, that was all I wanted.
But this morning, when we drove back into town I thought-
If I lost you now,
I'd be a large fool.
As a matter of fact, I have an odd feeling, you know, that my life wouldn't be-
Well, it'd be sort of empty if I went back to England and you weren't there to go with me.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Your daughter's just been proposed to, Mr. Fleury.
- By whom?
- Me, I'm afraid.
Euan, would you mind leaving?
I'd like to talk to my parents alone.
I'll see you later.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
If you're in love with him, I see no reason why you shouldn't accept him.
After all, you won't be any hindrance... as far as his going up to Oxford and his career is concerned.
You haven't said yet whether you are in love with him.
Oh. Yes, I think so.
I mean, very much.
But it's not quite that simple.
Euan has a name.
He has duties and obligations.
I have to be quite certain.
Is there any reason why I shouldn't marry him?
What do you mean?
What reason could there be?
Daddy, is there any reason why I shouldn't marry Euan?
No. There's no good reason why you shouldn't marry him.
Oh. Put it down there.
Oh, hello, Bradshaw.
Oh, hello, Mr. Fleury.
Hot, isn't it?
- Here's your paper, Mr. Fleury.
- Thank you, boy.
"The Fleury family is a perfect example of the problems faced...
"by many of the old families on this island.
"For 300 years, there has been marriage and intermarriage...
"with nobody sure of their precise ancestry.
"But a veil of secrecy, whispers and innuendo has been drawn across this problem.
"Julian Fleury was brought up in England.
"A distinguished Wessex family was delighted 35 years ago...
"when he proposed marriage to their youngest daughter.
"Presumably, they did not know that Julian Fleury's mother... who died in childbirth, was a Jamaican with colored ancestry."
Is it true?
It's true.
What were you lashing out at when you tried to slap me?
Your own guilt?
Your betrayal of us?
- Betrayal? Your mother never knew.
- She knew.
- Didn't you, Mother?
- Yes, I knew.
But how?
An anonymous letter.
It came years ago.
- And you never mentioned it.
- I saw no reason to.
I wanted to keep things as they were.
- Faithful wife, noble mother-
- Maxwell, stop it!
How do you expect him to feel?
How do you think I feel?
To believe that you belong to one kind of a world, and then, suddenly-
When I asked you if there was any reason why I shouldn't marry Euan, you said no.
I said there was no good reason.
How can you say that?
Euan's heir to a title.
Can you picture a black man sitting in the House of Lords if we had a son?
There's no need to exaggerate.
My mother was three-quarters white.
I've only 1/16 of colored blood.
The chances are your children will be completely white!
Bradshaw was right.
All this whispering, all this secrecy.
How shall I face it here?
Will you listen to me, quietly, for a minute?
At the start of any misfortune, one always feels that the end of the world has come.
Well, the end of mine has.
Perhaps I ought to leave this island, take
Sylvia with me, make a fresh start somewhere.
- Do you think that'd be best?
- Do I have any other choice?
I can see myself walking into the club.
Anybody for tennis?
There's Fleury.
He's perfect for mixed-doubles.
His grandmother's a bit on the dark side, you know.
Your roots are here.
Your life is here.
Oh, it's easy to talk about making a fresh start.
But what would you do?
Where would you go?
What do the Fleurys know except how to run a plantation?
Nothing.
Think it over.
Talk to Sylvia.
Think it over.
Talk to Sylvia.
Now, above all, we must keep our heads.
The great thing is to do nothing hasty.
Behave as though nothing extraordinary has happened.
Otherwise people will say,
"Oh, look at the Fleurys.
They daren't hold their heads up in public."
Go to the club tonight.
Behave naturally.
Don't avoid people, and, uh, don't send them too many drinks.
No. I won't come. I don't want it to look as if the clan was mustering in force.
Woman: This is Forbes field in Pittsburgh, and this is our national pastime-- the game of baseball, as played by the Pittsburgh pirates.
[Laughter]
I didn't know a thing about baseball.
My usual job was writing the household hints column on the ladies' page, but the paper was running a series of articles-- what's wrong with the pirates?
The sports editor wanted the woman's angle.
All I knew was that
Pittsburgh was losing.
This, I learned, was quite normal.
He's out!
The manager of the pirates was a large man named Guffy Mcgovern who was always coming out to discuss things with the umpire.
I was too far away to hear, but he seemed upset, irritated, maybe even angry.
What's the matter with you?
[Cursing unintelligibly]
You hear me?
All right, Guffy, watch your language, or I'll throw you out of the game.
There was certainly something wrong with the pirates.
Take that time when Cincinnati was batting and that pirate player got hit in the head with the ball.
That didn't seem right.
[Cursing unintelligibly]
And later in the game, when the pirates were hitting and had a good chance to score, well, even I knew three runners on one base was too many.
You're out!
You're out!
Great!
That's the first time you three guys have been together all season.
[Laughter]
The score at the end of the game was Cincinnati, 21,
Pittsburgh, 2.
You through, Jenny?
I haven't even started.
How do you get a story out of that?
Well, you hit them on a bad day.
Yeah.
Yeah. They had a good one back in 1938.
Hey, maybe I should talk to Mcgovern, huh?
Now?
Well, yeah.
That's a wonderful idea.
Everybody should talk to Mcgovern at least once.
Well, how do I get down there?
Well, you see that second tunnel down there?
Yeah.
Go down through that.
The first door on the right is the entrance to the pirate clubhouse.
Oh, thanks, and thanks for letting me sit here.
Anytime.
And, Jen, give Guffy our best regards.
I will. Bye.
Bye.
What a dirty trick.
So ends another holocaust in Forbes field, the pirates' exhibition of skill this afternoon reducing their standing to seventh place in the national league.
By the way, I'll not be with you for the balance of the season.
It seems in the course of my sportscasts,
I have somehow offended the great Guffy Mcgovern, alleged manager of the pirates.
Steps have been taken, and briefly, your announcer has been canned.
I'll still have my regular
Tuesday night broadcast and Wednesday television, and I shall continue to call the plays as I see them.
This is Fred Bayles saying thank you, Guffy Mcgovern.
No, no, lady. You can't go in there.
Press.
No.
Gangway.
Uh, Mr. Mcgovern, please.
Does he come out this way?
When he's dressed, he does.
I'd like a story, so I think I'll wait.
Lady, he just lost a ball game 21-2.
He's unhappy.
You can't win all the time.
Guffy Mcgovern:
I would like to say a few words about today's endeavor with the Cincinnatis.
Of all the...
[Cursing unintelligibly]
Personally, I think it was a waste of time to send me.
I don't know the game, and I haven't any story, but I can tell you what's wrong with the pirates, all right-- that Mcgovern person.
Of all the loudmouthed, offensive-- and all those nice, clean-cut young men and the way he bullies them.
No wonder they make mistakes. Anybody would.
But if you ask me, the Pittsburgh pirates would be a lot better off without him, and so would the city of Pittsburgh!
Hey, write it.
Write what?
What you think about Mcgovern.
But he'd sue us.
Honey, compared to his real character, it'll read like a testimonial.
Do your worst, and let me see it when you're finished.
Well...
Hi, Jen.
Hi.
Household hints.
Obituary department.
12 more people kicked off today.
How was the game?
Anybody die out there?
Just the pirates.
Listen to this--
"Ignatius A. Turnball, aged 77 years, passed away at his home today following a..."
What a depressing job.
Think about me.
I have to write about
Guffy Mcgovern.
Now, there's an obituary
I'd like to handle.
Mr. Kirney must have liked the story.
He even put my byline on it--
"by Jennifer Paige, household hints editor."
He wanted more of the same-- personal stuff about Mcgovern.
I realized I'd have to do a little sleuthing.
I found out where he lived-- one furnished room and kitchenette near the ballpark.
He had no known relatives, never any visitors.
Every morning about 11:00, he left for the field.
There were plenty of empty cabs cruising around, but Mcgovern wanted the one without the driver.
He would.
[Honking horn]
Hail a cab!
Hail a cab!
This is the only hack in Pittsburgh?
You like the color or something?
You know the law, Sonny.
You're supposed to stay with your cab at all times.
Are you with it?
Forbes field and make it snappy.
Aw, the bums don't start until 1:30!
His afternoons were spent like this...
[Cursing unintelligibly]
The only place he was seen in public outside the ballpark was John's steakhouse.
They had the best steaks in town.
Medium rare.
Yeah.
I'm going over and talk to him.
You'll make a nice item tomorrow.
"Jennifer Paige, age 24, departed this world at approximately--" oh, stop.
I came here to corner him, didn't I?
Well, there he is, cornered.
Waiter, a Brandy for the lady.
Yes, sir.
I'm Jennifer Paige.
Jennifer Paige.
I wrote that story about you this morning in the messenger.
You didn't read it?
All I ever read is the box scores.
Well, I began this way...Quote--
"Aloysius X. Mcgovern,
"the evil-tongued orator of the baseball field
"is a surly, unbred goat
"whose mouth should be washed out regularly with a strong detergent."
Don't ever call me Aloysius.
You're--you're not mad?
Dogs have fleas.
Managers have sportswriters.
Oh, I'm not a sportswriter.
I do household hints for the ladies' page.
But I have a few facts and figures about your-- oh, don't put so much ketchup on your steak.
It spoils the flavor-- a few statistics that might be interesting.
For instance...
Last season, Minelli had a batting average of .310.
This year he had .210.
Now, that's 100 points difference.
Doesn't that prove something?
I'll have to speak to Minelli.
Cruickshank's average is way down, too--93 points, and Minden's and begg's, and it's the same right through the whole batting list.
Where'd you gather this information?
Tim Durney helped me.
He's the obituary editor.
What do you hear from want ads?
Well, I realize figures can be misleading, but when an entire team goes as sour as the pirates, well, I look around for a reason, and I look right at you.
Uh, what, uh, what-- what do you have to say,
Mr. Mcgovern?
What'd he say?
"Boo"?
Well, well, Guffy Mcgovern.
How are things in seventh place?
Fine. Fine.
What do you do with your afternoons now, junior?
Thanks to you,
I just signed a deal to broadcast for the giants, whom, as you may have heard, are leading the league.
Meanwhile, I'm just lying around thinking of things to say about you.
Why don't you catch me tonight?
I'm on the air in an hour.
I can't wait.
I got a mission in life now, Guffy.
I'm going to run you out of this town, maybe right out of organized baseball.
You wouldn't do that.
Oh, yes, I would.
I'm a stinker.
Why don't we talk this over?
Let's step in here a minute.
I got an exclusive for you.
[Thumping]
[Punch]
[Thud]
* take me out to the ball game *
* take me out to the... ** before I say good night,
I would like to reiterate...
My opinions are those of an unbiased observer who has the best interests of baseball at heart.
There is nothing personal in my feud with Guffy Mcgovern.
Incidentally, don't look for me on television tomorrow.
[Crowd cheering]
By asking questions,
I began to learn baseball.
Question-- what is a balk?
Answer-- see me tomorrow.
Question-- what is a rhubarb?
Answer...
[Shouting]
He's out.
The man was out!
The man was out!
Get out, Mcgovern!
You're out of the game!
[Clapping in time to Mcgovern's footsteps]
[Clapping stops]
Boo!
Boo!
[Clapping in time to footsteps]
Radio:
And there you have it.
Final score--Cincinnati, 9,
Pittsburgh, 0.
The pirates had a total of 3 hits, 7 errors.
The reds, 14 hits-- don't be so modest, Baxter.
You made two of those errors all by yourself.
Well, what's the matter, Mr. Minden?
Did you think that was second base?
Ah, I'm certainly proud of you athletes today.
Particularly you,
Mr. Ronson, our schoolboy star, the pride of Milwaukee high.
But I worry about you, son.
You're going to catch a fly ball some of these days and knock out your front teeth.
Ah, Cruicksie.
Cruicksie, you were fine.
You didn't fall down once.
And here we have the famous Saul Hellman, our relief pitcher.
You fellas may not believe this, but Saul once pitched a two-hitter in a world series.
Of course, that was quite some time ago, but he's still in there pitching.
1 walk and 4 hits on 10 pitched balls.
Don't you think you're a little old for this pastime, Saul?
You should have quit winners when you could still reach the plate.
Easy, Saul.
I'm glad for one thing-- today's game puts us in eighth place.
We can go no lower in this league.
We used to have a guy like that in the 3-i league once.
We used to put gunpowder in his cigarettes.
Hey, has Mcgovern always been like this?
You knew him in the minors, didn't you, way back when?
Well, what I mean is, you know, when you were first breaking in.
You can say it--
16 years ago.
Oh, you've got plenty of stuff left. Plenty.
Sure.
Where's my good luck piece?
I put it in your uniform.
Well, where is it?
Maybe you dropped it out on the field.
Of all the...
[Cursing unintelligibly]
Oh, shut up!
What?
Close your fat mouth.
I want to talk to you.
If that's some wise guy on the P.A. system,
I'll bust his snoot.
You'll bust nobody's snoot if you know what's good for you.
You've been busting snoots and polluting the air with your foul talk long enough, Mcgovern.
Frankly, we're fed up.
Do tell.
And who are you, may I ask?
An angel.
How's that?
I'm an angel.
Well, you must be very proud.
Let me get my hands on him.
I'll make him an angel.
Oh, you're cold, Mcgovern.
I never sit in the field boxes.
Where do you sit?
Usually on the right hand of the archangel Gabriel.
That name mean anything to you?
Sure, sure. Gabriel.
Trumpet player.
None of your lip, Guffy, or I'll boot you over the center field wall.
I can get just as tough as you. Remember that.
I'll murder this guy!
Cold, Guffy.
Oh, colder still.
Now you're getting warm.
Keep talking.
The angel Gabriel's taken a personal interest in you, bigmouth.
It seems someone down there's been sending up a lot of prayers on your behalf.
Somebody praying for me. Gee.
One punch!
That's all I ask! One punch!
Before he answers those prayers, he'd like to clean you up a little, and I'm stuck with the job.
Now, there's certain rules.
I'll give them to you fast.
Number 1-- cut out the blasphemy.
Number 2--start treating your fellow men with a little more respect and understanding.
Quit making life miserable for everybody around you.
Number 3-- and this is important-- love and stop slugging thy neighbor.
You hear me?
I hear you fine.
Why can't I see you for one moment?
Because I usually stay as far away from you as possible.
The bleachers!
Stay where you are!
Stand still and listen, or I'll blast you with a bolt of lightning.
Now don't rile me, boy.
Just behave yourself, and we'll get along fine.
As a matter of fact,
I'll make a deal with you-- lay off swearing and fighting, and I'll win you some ball games.
I might even win you a pennant.
You'd like to win a pennant again, wouldn't you, Mcgovern?
All right, you play ball with me, and I'll play ball with you.
How about that?
How do I know you're what you say you are?
Thunder and lightning's not enough, huh?
All right, Aloysius, you trusting soul, look for a miracle tomorrow night in the third inning.
What kind of a miracle?
Tomorrow night in the third inning...
Hey! Hey!
Hey, where are you?
Wait a minute!
Wait a--
[crowd cheering]
Ronson?
You're out!
You're out!
[Crowd cheering]
[Crowd cheering]
Safe!
[Crowd cheering]
[Crowd cheering]
Out!
Yeah? What?
I was about to suggest that possibly you erred on that decision.
Get off the field.
Yes, sir.
[swat]
Nice going, bigmouth.
[Take me out to the ball game playing]
Jennifer: The pirates had come to life.
On the road, they won 10 games straight, and stranger still,
Mcgovern was a changed man.
He hadn't punched a soul in two weeks.
The team was in sixth position when they played the braves in Boston.
It was the last inning.
The pirates were winning 8-6, a hard-fought game.
Boys, boys!
Now, boys, boys, please take it easy.
Now, I'll handle this.
Let me-- get out of my way, you bowlegged ape.
You fetter-mouthed donkey, you buckethead...
[Thunder]
Well, Mcgovern, you sure talked your way out of that one.
10 straight games, and then you had to go and blow it.
Now, look-- take off your hat.
Yes, sir.
All I said this afternoon--
I heard what you said.
Don't repeat it.
Well, look.
The guy called me an ape.
Bowlegged ape.
Yeah.
You are a little bowlegged.
What am I supposed to do-- take it as a compliment?
Don't I get a chance to talk back?
Certainly.
The English language has a total of 698,000 words.
We ask you to avoid
1/100 of 1% of these, which, at the moment, seems to be your entire vocabulary.
I'll be tongue-tied.
Shakespeare wasn't, nor Milton, nor Robert burns.
Study, Mcgovern, study.
Ok, I keep my trap shut,
I win all my games, huh?
Now, wouldn't that look a little silly, the pirates winning every game?
Yes, it would.
Besides, we have other things to do.
A lot of time, you'll be on your own, and when you need us, we'll be in there pitching.
Who's we?
Me and my boys-- the heavenly choir nine.
Ball players?
Sure.
In heaven?
Oh, there's plenty of ball players in heaven.
What do you know?
But very few managers.
Oh. How do your, uh, boys help?
Oh, they sort of get behind your boys, throw out a few quick hunches.
Who's on your squad, the heavenly choirs?
We won't go into that, but I don't mind telling you that we have a team batting average of .331.
Good club.
Not bad.
When your boys played baseball down here, did I know any of them?
Did I know you?
We might have run into each other.
On what base?
Ha ha ha ha.
Come on. A guy's got a right to know his own angel.
Just give me a hint.
What team were you with?
What position?
All right, lay off, Mcgovern.
Your broken-down ball club is winning ball games.
What more do you want?
I'll see you around, huh?
Now, wait. Listen-- good-bye. Keep your nose out of things that don't concern you.
All right, all right.
Don't go away sore, huh?
Sorry, Mr. Mcgovern.
Oh, that's all right.
Sit down, son.
Well, I told Minelli I'd have dinner with him.
Hey, when you made that catch today, how come you were laying so far to your right?
I don't know.
I had sort of a feeling
Johnson would hit it there.
A left-hander?
He never hit there in his life.
I don't know. Just call it a hunch.
He's reading Shakespeare.
Go on!
The tempest. I had it in English three.
He asked me to sit down with him.
Yeah. This morning he said hello.
I don't like it, boys.
It isn't natural.
He hasn't changed.
He's just charging his batteries.
Waiter.
Yes, sir?
Did you do what I said?
Yes, sir.
This all right?
You're sure it's tough enough?
Mr. Baxter, this was cut right from between the horns.
Here, sir.
Hey, Saul.
Yeah.
Pull up a chair.
Thanks, but I'd like to digest my dinner.
You did all right in the old days.
Remember how we used to tear around?
I don't want to think about the old days.
I don't want to think about you.
Do you mind?
Your steak all right, sir?
It's a wee bit tough, but it has a very nice flavor.
When the pirates played their next game in Pittsburgh, it started out just like any other afternoon.
But events were taking shape in the bleacher section.
Some orphan kids, in on passes, had come to cheer for the home team.
It was a regular weekly event.
Who's pitching,
Mr. Smalley?
Martin, sister.
Won 4, lost 6.
[Snap]
Come on, Martin.
Stay in there and keep it high.
If he feeds it to Modbury low, he'll put it right in our laps.
Oh, dear.
Don't worry about
Martin. He's super.
Let's go, Marty!
Show 'em what you did in Boston!
Pass the peanuts, dear.
Fair!
Hey, ump!
Fair?
Fair ball?
Why, thou knave, thou dolt, thou hast eyes but seest not.
You heard him.
He said fair.
Fie! Fie upon you and a pox upon you, too!
Thou art blind, thou black-livered bat!
Hey, Hamlet, blow.
All right, let's get it.
Come on.
Atta-boy, Joe.
Jennifer: The orphan kids cheered for the pirates all through the game, but they were losing.
It was the sixth inning, the score, 7-2 in favor of the Phillies.
Things were looking bad for the pirates.
Then suddenly it happened.
Look! Look at the angel behind Mandekic.
What did you say, dear?
And there's one behind Ronson, too, and Rothberg and Rezende.
There's one in back of everybody.
One what?
Angel.
Get her out of the sun.
Come along, Bridget.
Come along.
How do you feel, dear?
I feel fine.
[Crowd cheering]
There they are again!
Bridget, there are people sitting behind you.
But I see them--angels.
The kid is seeing angels.
Ain't nothing to what I've seen sometimes.
Look!
Shh! You'll get us in trouble.
Bridget, that's enough.
But I see 'em, sister, big as life-- in the outfield, in the infield...
And there's one sitting on the scoreboard.
Are you having trouble, sister?
Nothing I can't take care of, thank you.
Do you want to leave again and not come back?
No, sister.
Then let's have no more angels.
Jennifer: The pirates won again, 10-7.
It was getting to be a habit.
On the way out,
I ran into Smalley, the park cop.
He told me about the little girl in the bleachers, an orphan who saw angels.
I had my story for the day.
* take me out to the ball game *
* take me out to the fray *
* la da da da da da * hello, Joe.
Good morning.
* la da da da Dee Dee Dee *
* buy me some peanuts and crackerjack-- ** yes?
Uh, I'd like to see a little girl.
Come in, please.
What age?
Oh, uh, about 8, I guess.
That would be third grade--my class.
Would you wait just a moment, please?
Sure.
[Clack clack]
Children, there's a gentleman here.
He's looking for a little girl.
They never adopt them with glasses.
[Clack clack clack clack]
Why, Mr. Mcgovern.
I think she's the one.
I--
I'd like to talk to you.
I think you should talk to some of the others, too.
We have some very nice girls here.
I'm sure.
What is it, sister?
Mr. Mcgovern.
How do you do? I...
I came about the story in the paper.
Yes. I read it.
Is this the kid that-- is she the little girl who saw the angels?
I just want to ask her a couple of questions.
Bridget, wait in my office.
Yes, sister.
Thank you, sister.
Mr. Mcgovern, will you come with me, please?
Thank you.
I'm sister Edwitha, mother superior.
How the paper got the story
I have no idea, but I think it's best for all concerned that we just forget it.
Yes. Oh, sister...
Excuse me, but you don't know baseball, baseball fans.
Thing like this gets started, it becomes a big megillah.
Oh, a megillah's a sort of a-- federal case.
Yeah.
Go on.
Well, the fans want answers.
I'm the manager, and I got to supply them.
A little girl sits too long in the sun without her hat on, and she thinks she sees something.
Surely you don't believe they were angels.
Oh, me?
Would it do any harm just to talk to her?
I don't want the child excited.
I won't. I promise.
Well, just one moment.
Oh, there's one other thing.
Yes?
In the seventh inning yesterday afternoon, when Rothberg was on third, why didn't you try a squeeze?
They were expecting it.
Well, that's just it-- they were expecting it, and they knew that you knew that they were expecting it, so you wouldn't pull it.
Why, it would be completely unexpected.
Rothberg's fast.
He'd have made home easily.
Yeah. Well,
Rothberg happens to have a bad ankle.
He hurt it in practice.
Oh, I'll light a candle for him.
[Doorbell buzzes]
Will you just go along in and excuse me?
Hiya.
Hi.
Sit down.
You, uh...
Um...
You read this?
It says yesterday you saw angels.
Did you?
Are you sure?
Did you ever see angels before?
Well, how'd you know they were angels?
They looked like angels.
With wings?
Well, sort of like wings.
Not baseball uniforms?
Sort of like uniforms.
What color socks?
I couldn't see.
Their robes were too long.
How many were there?
One behind each player-- the pirates, I mean-- one on the scoreboard and one in the bullpen.
Was there one behind me?
Uh-huh.
Is he there now?
Who's that?
That's Saint Gabriel.
Figures.
Now, about these, uh,
"sort of like uniforms."
Was there any writing across the chest, like New York, maybe, or, uh, cardinals or Dodgers?
It wasn't a whole name, just initials.
Well, what initials?
H.C.
[Gasps]
Heavenly choir.
What?
Uh, nothing, nothing. Uh...
Uh...
Now, uh...
About these other kids.
They didn't see anything, huh?
Just you?
Why was that, do you suppose?
Maybe because I've been praying for you.
Me? You've been praying for me?
The whole team.
How long have you been praying?
Ever since you hit the slump.
You must have been praying pretty hard, huh?
Oh, yes, every night and every morning, and...And sometimes during arithmetic.
That's very nice.
Thanks.
Well, you needed help, didn't you?
We sure did.
I prayed to
Saint Gabriel personally.
He's our patron Saint.
Good man, Gabriel.
What's your name?
Bridget white, 8 years old.
How long have you been here?
Eight years.
Oh. I, uh,
I have to shove off now, Bridget.
It's been nice talking to you.
So long.
So long.
Oh, Bridget, about those prayers.
Keep 'em coming, huh?
He's nice, isn't he?
No, no, no, you can't see her. I'm sorry.
Now, please go away.
We won't hurt the kid, sister.
The whole story is ridiculous.
"No angels, says sister Edwitha."
Can we quote that?
Don't you dare.
Sister.
Don't you print that picture, young man.
Evening post, sister.
It's a beauty.
Well, hiya, Guffy.
How's the angels?
Look, let me out of here, will ya?
How about a statement, Guffy?
No comment.
No comment.
Maybe he believes in them, too.
How about it?
Yeah. What are you doing here, Guffy?
Where's your harp?
Lay off me, will you?
You want to know about angels, ask her.
She wrote the story.
I'm getting out of here.
[Thunder]
Now what did I do?
Oh, nothing personal, eh?
[Doorbell buzzes]
Well, miss household hints.
What can I do for you?
You can listen while I say I'm sorry.
Honestly, I had no idea that story would raise such a fuss.
If I had,
I never would have-- what a mess this place is--
I never would have written it.
Your mistake was in showing up at that orphanage.
The newspapers are going to make a monkey out of you.
Goat, monkey--
I'm used to it.
If I were you,
I'd protect myself, Mcgovern.
Make a statement.
To you?
Why not?
Miss Paige, you're ruining my carpet.
Oh, don't be afraid of mud stains.
They're very easy to take out.
Here, do you mind?
Stuff them with newspaper, turn on the oven, and put them underneath.
What kind of a parrot is this?
It's a parrot.
Does it talk?
Yes.
Did you teach it?
Yes.
Scratch my head, please.
Well...
He's very polite, isn't he?
Why shouldn't he be?
What else does he say?
He says, "hello, how've you been?"
And "good-bye."
Joe, say good-bye to the lady.
Good-bye.
That's wonderful.
But doesn't he ever...
Well, with you teaching him, doesn't he-- a man only swears when he's annoyed.
Joe never annoys me.
We're very happy together, Joe and I.
Well, frankly, I don't see how you can be in a shambles like this.
How do you ever find anything?
Look, there isn't even a place for a guest to sit down.
There might be an idea in that.
Well, you can't get rid of me just yet, so you might as well make the best of it.
You know,
I've always wondered what baseball players did on rainy afternoons.
Entertain lady reporters who drop in uninvited.
Well, you're not being very entertaining.
What about the story of your life, Mcgovern, while my shoes are drying?
Were you always so tough?
Even when you were little?
You had a boyhood, of course.
Tilton falls, Wisconsin.
I looked you up.
Sounds like a nice little town.
It was--four pool halls, five saloons, and the biggest pants factory in the state.
Did you play ball there?
I sold peanuts.
Your folks weren't very well-off, huh?
My folks did fine. They had one of the saloons.
One day, they gave you a ball and a bat, and that's how you got started.
Not exactly. I used to throw snowballs at the cop on the corner.
It was a long block and a long winter, so I finished up a third baseman.
Any more "down memory Lane" stuff you'd like?
No.
[Sniff sniff]
Are you cooking something?
My shoes!
Yeah, they're kind of crisp.
I said under the oven, not in it.
Of all the stupid, asinine-- shh! Not in front of Joe.
Oh. How do you suggest I get home?
Well, I could loan you a pair of my shoes, or I'll call a cab.
Where do you live?
Delaney street.
And how do I get to the cab?
I weigh 110 pounds.
When the cleaning woman comes in, tell her to burn all the old papers and put an airwick in the corner to get rid of that cigar smell--
I like cigar smoke.
And scour the ashtrays with ammonia.
Oh, and if she wants to take the ink stains out of that burgundy chair-- what chair?
Burgundy, that's a color-- she can call me at the office-- extension 1173.
Will you open the door?
You know, I could be a big help to you.
Just what I always needed-- a girl with turned-up shoes. 110?
Yeah.
Here, take these to Delaney street.
So if I took her to the ball game and we sat in the grandstand out of the sun, she wouldn't see any angels, of course,
I'd write the story just that way, and that would be the end of it.
All right.
Bridget!
Bridget!
Ooh! This is Bridget white, miss Paige.
Hello.
Would you like to go to the ball game with her this afternoon?
Can I?
Mm-hmm.
Will we speak to Mr. Mcgovern?
Well, uh, we can wave.
All right, run along.
Comb your hair, put on a hat...
With a brim!
Jennifer: Bridget and I got pretty chummy during the game, exchanging girlish confidences.
The boys in the press box kept showing up with a steady stream of hot dogs and Eskimo pies and asking Bridget if she saw any angels.
Uh, vanilla ok?
Oh, thank you.
Mac, I think that's enough.
How's it going, honey?
The, uh, angels working yet?
Uh-uh.
Well, you'll let us know, won't you?
Oh, uh, Jenny, how about dinner after the game?
Oh, thanks, but I'm testing a new recipe tonight.
Well, have fun.
Bye.
Do you live alone?
All by myself.
That must be nice.
Why?
I mean, instead of having a lot of kids around all the time.
Kids are such a bother, aren't they?
Mmm...It depends.
I always say, why not live alone if you can live alone?
Take like if you had someone around the house all the time.
You couldn't even come to the ball game when you wanted.
Not unless I brought her with me.
What's the matter?
They're warming up.
Who?
The angels.
Oh, now, Bridget, no!
There they come, out on the field.
There's no one, nothing.
Look!
Don't you see?
You couldn't possibly see anything down there.
Do you hear me, Bridget?
But I do. There's one behind every player.
Oh, no! Come on, get out of here quick!
Hey, they're going!
Hey, Jenny! Jenny, wait a minute!
Honey! Jenny, Jenny, what's the story?
Look, fellas. We're leaving, that's all.
Did you see any angels?
How many were there, Bridget?
Nine!
Nine?
Nine?
Reynolds here.
Take this--
"the angels were out in force today, said little
Bridget white."
Wait in here, please.
All right.
Thank you.
I hear the kid's sick.
What did you do to her?
Nothing. I think it was just the ice cream and the four frankfurters.
Nice food for a kid.
You ought to know better.
Why did you want to drag her out there in the first place?
I didn't drag her.
She was dying to go.
I only wanted to help.
Help? Fine help.
"Mcgovern's angels strike again."
What are you trying to do-- laugh me out of baseball?
Mr. Mcgovern,
I haven't laughed since the day I met you.
Were they boy angels or girl angels?
Boy angels.
Did they look like people or did they look like the pictures of angels on our little prayer cards?
Prayer cards.
Sore, huh?
What color robe did they wear?
White, eh?
You're sure they were angels?
They weren't groundkeepers?
Or they were peanut vendors?
Angels.
[Door opens]
Sister, Mr. Mcgovern and miss Paige, they'd like to see Bridget.
Oh, please, can they?
I don't see why not.
Organically, she's fine.
Just a little upset stomach is all.
But, uh, emotionally,
I'm not so sure.
You really think that we should-- he can do no harm.
He's an excellent man.
Bridget, I don't want to alarm you, but we're going to call another doctor.
He won't give you any medicine.
He'll just ask you a few questions.
You understand, don't you?
Sure. You want to find out if I'm wacky.
Doctor, I'm sure it's not necessary.
Only a few minutes, please.
Now, don't you go upsetting her.
How you feeling?
Much better, thank you.
You just ate too much junk, huh?
It was the nicest time
I ever had.
I brought you a present.
Oh, thank you.
You shouldn't have.
Aw, it's nothing.
It's beautiful!
Yeah. Well, it jumps, too, if you just squeeze this little thing here at the end, see?
[Squeaking]
It talks, too.
Imagine.
Well, it's just a kid's kangaroo.
I'll take it back and get you a real toy.
No. Please.
I love it.
But will you come to see me again anyway?
Yeah. Sure. Every day as long as you're sick.
Miss Paige, too?
Me, too.
Now, I think you'd better get some sleep.
Yeah. Good night,
Bridget.
Every day while I'm sick?
Of course.
Sure.
Good night.
Jenny: The story became a national issue.
Everyone was talking about angels.
There were newsreel interviews with baseball celebrities.
Bayles: Joe DiMaggio,
Yankees center fielder.
What do you think, Joe?
If Mcgovern needs any extra angels, we'd be glad to give him a couple of ours.
Ty Cobb, one of baseball's all-time greats.
What do you think,
Mr. Cobb?
Well, all I can say is that this game of baseball has certainly changed.
Bayles: Songwriter
Harry Ruby, composer of three little words,
America's number-one baseball fan.
I predicted this at the start of the season when I said,
"heaven help the pirates."
Bayles: Bing Crosby, part owner of the Pittsburgh pirates.
You know, I think this angel stuff's pretty sound.
Lots of times folks think someone's watching over them.
Thanks.
Jenny: Whenever the team was in town,
Mcgovern paid a visit to the orphanage, and he made good his promise to bring a new present.
Now if you just go back to your seats so everybody can see...
Just turn this knob, see?
Now watch.
Announcer: He's got that chin lock again.
Yanking his head back.
The monster is trying to put on a leg crusher.
Very educational.
Yeah.
When the pirates climbed into third place, the newspapers laid off Mcgovern.
The angels were completely forgotten.
Tell him to bunt.
Wait.
Let him hit away.
Stay in there, Lou.
Safe!
That was a nice switch.
Just a hunch.
[Whistling]
* happy birthday to you *
* happy birthday to you ** happy birthday, Mcgovern.
What goes on?
A party!
But how did you know?
Bridget, she looked it up in the sporting news.
Parrot:
Hello.
Hiya, Joe.
I didn't throw out a single thing you'll ever miss.
Don't you like it?
Sure.
Sure, I like it.
Hey, a cake and everything.
Jennifer made it.
I turned on the oven.
What do you know?
A regular birthday party.
I haven't had one since I was 10.
Believe me, that's a long time ago.
It sure is.
The book said-- never mind.
I tell you what, on your birthday,
I'll give you a party.
When is it?
Well, I'm not sure exactly, but the home picked October 5th.
That's the only day they had open.
Look, you help me in the kitchen, and, Bridget, why don't you give Joe a piece of this celery, huh?
That-a girl.
I hope you don't mind.
She's getting such a kick out of it.
Why should I mind?
Would you hand me the salt, please?
Hey, what smells?
So good, I mean.
Uh, ragout of veal a la brignole.
Oh, fancy stuff, eh?
Mm-hmm. You eat too many steaks, Mcgovern.
Change will be good for you.
Yeah, brignole smells great.
You know, I often wonder who dreams up all these things.
Uh, Mrs. Harkrider Oates of Rawson Avenue.
Is that so?
Her favorite recipe.
Guaranteed to keep men at home.
Now the butter, please.
Well, we won again today, didn't we?
Yeah, we did.
I suppose you realize we're only five games out of first place.
I've heard some talk.
Isn't it wonderful?
Just a few weeks ago, we were last.
Wonder how it happened.
Angels.
Shh! The parsley, please.
The green stuff, the parsley.
Right there.
Thank you.
I have a different theory, you know.
I think it's you.
Me?
Sure. The pirates are playing as a team.
Why don't you take your apron off, honey?
'Cause you're not losing your temper and yelling your head off and swinging on people.
Sister Edwitha says,
"never swing on people.
You should turn the other cheek."
Well, there's two schools of thought on that.
My school recommends getting in the first punch.
Sister Edwitha says,
"turn the other cheek."
You see?
Ok, I suppose she knows best.
Now, you can carry this.
Bridget, you take the peas.
Now, be careful.
They're hot. There.
Look out!
You'll sit on the presents.
Oh!
That one's mine.
I'll save this till last.
Well.
Not too loud, is it?
No, no.
Yellow and green's not loud.
Now...
Well, what do you know?
A baseball.
It's not just an ordinary baseball.
Jennifer sent it into the clubhouse, and all the pirates signed it. See?
All except Mr. Hellman.
He was in the shower.
Imagine, an autographed ball.
That's just what I wanted.
Well, come on, let's try this.
Well, what's the matter?
Well, what about grace?
Grace who?
Oh, grace.
Yeah, grace.
I almost forgot.
You--you lead off.
Oh, lord, make us truly thankful for these, thy gifts, which we are about to receive.
Amen.
You know, I'm hungry.
I hope I fixed enough of everything.
Cooking for myself the way I do,
I'm never exactly sure how much I should-- oh, don't eat that.
No. No, it's...Delicious.
Oh, no, don't! It's poison.
I never in all my life--
Mrs. Harkrider Oates of Rawson Avenue is certainly going to hear from me in the morning.
Keeps men at home, does it?
Maybe she means permanently.
I can't understand it, though.
Unless that olive oil...
Could it have been rancid?
How long have you had it?
What olive oil?
The olive oil in the cupboard, in the bottle in the cupboard.
Neat's foot oil.
What?
Not olive oil, neat's foot oil.
I rub it in my glove.
Keeps the leather soft.
What's it doing in the cupboard?
I got to put it someplace.
It's wonderful for gloves.
It certainly doesn't do anything for veal.
The peas are fine.
You can't make a meal on peas.
Oh, I just feel awful.
I should have looked at the bottle.
I always look at the bottle-- now, wait, now, don't lose your head.
This is my birthday, and I'm not going to have it spoiled by Mrs. Harkrider Oates of Rawson Avenue.
How's that?
All right?
Well, well, well.
This is a cozy little scene.
Birthday party?
Yeah, yeah.
Keep moving, huh?
I don't like to intrude, but may I have your autograph,
Mr. Mcgovern, on a check?
I got the tab today from my dentist.
Repairing bridgework--
Just send me the bill, first of the month.
I think you'll like this.
Here, look-- will you stop?
I thought you'd like to see what you're paying for.
I beg your pardon.
Look, blow, huh?
Please?
Uh, let me explain.
You see, a few weeks ago,
Mr. Mcgovern, in his usual charming, inimitable style, put the slug on me.
Didn't you, Guffy?
Would you step outside for a moment?
I would be delighted.
Mcgovern...
Oh, sure, sure.
Don't worry.
Yeah? What?
Look, I'm having a little birthday.
Don't louse it up.
You had a couple of drinks.
You feel good.
I feel fine.
Great shape.
Sure. Be a nice guy.
Go on home.
Why should I be a nice guy for you? Give me one reason.
Nobody's bothering you tonight.
Nobody will, and if any certain party tries to bother me,
I'll hook him in the mouth.
Now, wait a minute.
[Woman screams]
I'll take her in.
You stay where you are.
You'll have to carry her.
Up we go.
Come on.
Come in.
Please.
Right up to bed now, dear.
Good night.
Good night.
That's a sweet kid, that one.
Did you have a good party?
Nicest time I ever had in my life.
Happy birthday.
Thanks.
Uh, what happens to the kids here, sister?
What do you mean?
Do they stay here forever?
Doesn't anybody ever come around and, you know...
Adopt them?
Occasionally.
Not so often as we'd like.
They all seem to want tiny babies now.
I'd be afraid.
Were you thinking of adopting Bridget?
Who, me?
No, I just, uh...
I...
I couldn't, could I?
Well, it would present certain problems.
There's no law against it, of course, but the court usually doesn't permit children to go to unmarried people.
Yeah, that would be a problem.
I'll pray on it.
Thanks.
It's not that I couldn't afford to keep her.
I got some dough saved.
I just never had anybody to spend it on.
A kid like that ought to have somebody, like a father.
Not that I'm any shining example of behavior.
There have been some times...
And baseball's a pretty tough game, and a lot of people say that I...
Well, maybe you've heard.
I sat in back of first base one day.
Well, I don't have to tell you.
That's all over.
Believe me.
It's a thing of the past.
I keep my mouth shut and my hands in my pockets.
No language.
Not even one fight.
You see, sister, we were in this restaurant, and there was this fella-- good night, sister.
Good night, Mcgovern.
Wait for me, will you?
She's really a sweet child.
She just adores you.
Have you ever thought of adopting her?
Who, me?
I don't see anybody else around here.
Don't be silly.
What would I want with a kid around the house?
Besides, a thing like that presents certain problems.
Well, this is where I live.
What kind of problems?
Problems.
Oh.
It's been a wonderful evening, especially the main event.
I'll bet that's the first black eye you've had in years.
You travel around with me,
I'll fix you good.
Is my face on crooked or something?
Well, yours is.
You better go home and fix it.
And don't believe that beefsteak routine.
That's just superstition.
What it needs is hot and cold applications, preferably Epsom salts.
Look, you make a move,
I'll make a move.
Huh?
A long time ago,
I played third base in Minneapolis.
There was a girl in St. Paul, the nicest girl I ever knew.
We did a lot of talking, and I made some big plans, but they didn't include a certain shortstop, the one she finally married.
It was quite a blow.
I can imagine.
I guess I've been taking it out on everybody else ever since.
Good night.
Good night.
Sister, is it always right to turn the other cheek?
Certainly. Why?
Mr. Mcgovern did last night, and he got sloughed something awful.
The meek shall inherit the earth.
Jenny: I never missed a game after that.
In September, the pirates met the giants in the final series.
They needed three straight games to win the pennant.
Steady there! Make him pitch to you!
Two and two, boy.
Make him pitch to you.
Guffy!
How do you feel?
It's nothing.
I don't feel a thing.
I did it again, didn't I?
Why'd I have to go and wave at you?
It's nothing.
We won, didn't we?
Where am I having dinner?
I mean, where are you having dinner? I mean, us.
You're not going anyplace except home.
I've got a cab.
Hiya, Guffy.
Nice catch.
You ok?
Any permanent injuries?
No. I've been hit in the head 20 times.
I feel fine.
Did you see any angels out there?
I've never seen an angel, but I talk to one regularly.
What did you say?
You speak to angels?
Certainly.
Can we quote you?
Why not? An angel sits in back of me in the dugout every day.
Where are they running?
Let's get out of here.
Uhh!
Sister?
Hmm?
Isn't it wonderful?
I see them, and Guffy talks to them.
"Believe me, gentle listener.
"There is more to this than meets the eye.
"Mr. Mcgovern's antics on the field and off
"are no longer a source of amusement
"but a basis for serious inquiry.
"His latest peccadillo, an admission to the press that he converses with angels--" oh, for heaven's sakes!
You were hit in the head.
You could say anything.
"...is unworthy of the high position
"he now commands, proof beyond doubt
"that Mr. Mcgovern is, to put it charitably,
"emotionally unstable and guilty of conduct
"detrimental to organized baseball.
"Mr. Mcgovern's supporters
"claim his peculiar statement
"was made after being hit in the head with a line drive, therefore, he is not responsible."
He admits it.
I would like to ask
Mr. Mcgovern a question.
Was he responsible seven weeks ago in Boston?
How about it, Mcgovern?
Seven weeks ago, were you or were you not of sound mind and limb?
Beside me in the studio tonight is a man who can answer these questions.
Would you tell us your name, please?
Patrick J. Finley.
What is your occupation,
Mr. Finley?
I'm a groundskeeper at braves field up in Boston.
Will you please tell us what you saw in braves field about seven weeks ago?
Well, I seen
Mr. Mcgovern.
What time?
I don't know.
After the game.
Where was he?
Sitting on second base.
And what was he doing?
He was talking.
Talking to whom?
I don't know.
There wasn't anybody there.
And when he was sitting on second base talking to somebody who wasn't there, where was he looking?
Up.
What did he say?
I don't know exactly.
I couldn't hear everything.
I was in the dugout.
But one thing he said was,
"I have a right to know the name of my own angel."
He said that?
"My own angel"?
Yes, sir.
Then he said again,
"don't go away mad."
Thank you, Mr. Finley.
I ask you, ladies and gentlemen and Mr. commissioner, is this the act of a normal, reasonable man, to hang around second base at night and talk to angels?
Much as I hesitate to say this,
I think that Mr. Mcgovern should take a long, long, perhaps permanent rest.
The pirates chalked up a victory today, squeaking through by one lone run, playing uninspired ball.
They came to life in the final frame to sneak a run over the plate-- nice going, boys!
What's eating you?
So we win a ball game.
So, hurray.
I tell you, it's making me jumpy--angels, angels.
Every time I go after a ball,
I'm afraid I'm going to trip over something.
Shut up.
Did you watch Mcgovern out there looking over his shoulder every two seconds?
It's scary.
For all we know, this guy is off his rocker.
He might even be dangerous.
Lay off Mcgovern.
I don't care if he's talking to fence posts.
He's trying to be a right guy.
Your job is to play ball for him and keep your mouth shut, understand?
Ok, Saul.
Here he comes.
Announcer: And here's a flash that was just handed to me.
Arnold P. Hapgood, commissioner of baseball, will arrive in Pittsburgh tonight.
He is here to investigate
Guffy Mcgovern.
Well, that sounds like bad news for Pittsburgh.
With the pennant hanging on tomorrow's game,
I'm afraid the pirates and Mr. Mcgovern are in a pretty tough spot.
The pirates played mighty shaky ball out there this afternoon.
With this hanging over their heads, there's no telling what they'll do.
It's about my boys.
They're getting nervous, not that I blame them, but if it keeps on like this, they're apt to come apart tomorrow.
I thought maybe you might have something to suggest.
Nervous, huh?
Well, I wouldn't worry too much about it.
It's only natural at a time like this.
How are you doing?
Me? Great.
I'm in the pink.
One game away from a pennant, and they're trying to throw me in the loony bin.
I don't sleep nights.
I don't eat.
Just to make matters worse,
I'm fresh out of pitchers.
That so?
You know. I used four this afternoon.
Who do I start tomorrow?
Yeah. Well, I wouldn't worry about it.
Excuse me.
You got nothing to worry about.
You're all set.
With me, it's a little different.
Yeah?
Yeah. Martin's got a bad arm,
Clark's on the sick list, and Hellman's an old man.
He wouldn't last two innings.
Yeah. Saul's pretty tired.
Even I couldn't make him look good.
16 years is a lot of pitching in the major leagues.
It's his last one.
Next season they'll want to send him to the minors.
That won't make any difference to Saul.
He won't be around next season.
We're signing him up in the spring.
Saul?
Yeah. Everybody gets to play up here sooner or later.
But Saul...
We were friends.
At least we used to be.
Hellman was a great pitcher once.
He pitched a two-hitter in a world series, you know.
Yes, I know.
I was there.
Excuse me.
Good night.
Good night, Guffy.
This way, commissioner.
Commissioner, could you give us a few words about tomorrow?
Gentlemen, I have an appointment with all parties concerned tomorrow morning at 9:00, so until I hear all the evidence,
I have nothing to say.
The pirates are playing their last game of the season tomorrow afternoon for the pennant.
I'm aware of that.
Do you think is this the proper time to conduct the investigation?
Any time is the proper time when the situation warrants it.
Baseball is for the people who support it.
My desk is piled high with letters.
From New York, sir?
New York and other places.
In other words, you think Mcgovern has flipped his lid?
The hearing takes place tomorrow morning.
Oh, but,
Mr. commissioner...
Jenny: The hearing was like a courtroom trial.
The investigation hinged on two points.
One--are there such things as angels?
And two--is it possible to talk to them?
How long have you been practicing psychiatry,
Dr. Blane?
18 years.
You've just heard
Mr. Mcgovern's account of how a group of angels helped his ball team.
As a psychiatrist, how did his story impress you?
Belief in celestial beings is a carryover from mankind's ignorance and fear of his environment.
Originally, man worshipped the sun, the moon, stones, trees.
But with the rise of religion as we know it today, man felt the need of a closer alliance with a supreme being, and so he invented the angel.
Invented?
Precisely.
Just as a hurt child will run to its parent, so will a man turn for comfort to a belief in angels.
And when this belief takes the form of, uh, actual conversation with angels, what is your professional opinion?
Well, I'd prefer not to say, but...
I'd be happy to see you,
Mr. Mcgovern, in my office.
[Laughter]
Uh...
Ahem.
I think that'll be all, doctor, and thank you.
[Whispering]
Uh...
Mr. commissioner.
Yes?
I'd like to introduce three witnesses for the defense.
Yes, yes, of course.
Uh, gentlemen.
Mr. commissioner,
I do not know any of these gentlemen.
My name is Guffy Mcgovern.
Dr. Eustace Danforth,
Trinity church.
How do you do?
Rabbi Allan Hahn, temple Israel.
How do you do?
Father O'Hoolihan, church of our lady, queen of the angels.
Commissioner:
Uh, gentlemen, just make yourselves comfortable.
Mr. commissioner?
Uh, I suppose you gentlemen know the general idea in back of this inquiry?
Well, what do you think?
Uh, do you suppose there might be angels?
Right to left.
Lead the way,
Dr. Danforth.
To deny the existence of angels is to deny the word of the holy Bible, which is specific on the subject.
From the ancient Hebrew text, we have the words b'Nai Elohim-- the sons of god,
Kedoshim-- the holy ones, and mala-- mala-- how do you pronounce that?
Malachim.
Thank you, rabbi.
Malachim-- the messengers.
All of these may be translated "angels."
You'll check me on that, rabbi Hahn?
It was an angel who guided the children of Israel to the promised land.
"Behold, I send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way."
In psalms, again we find an angel-- the protector of man.
"The angel of the lord
"encampeth round about them that fear him and delivereth them."
Mcgovern:
Father O'Hoolihan?
Seeing as how there are whole coveys of angels flitting through the pages of the holy scriptures, both old and new testaments,
I don't see how I can get out of saying
I believe in them.
I imagine the commissioner does, too.
Oh, please, just leave me out of this.
Uh, Mr. commissioner...
Yes?
Father, would you also believe that, uh, they play baseball?
What's that?
Well, Mr. Mcgovern has testified that, uh, angels helped his team.
Well, now, considering all the great wonders that angels have performed,
I'd be much surprised if they couldn't play baseball, providing, of course, they had a mind to.
But would they?
With all respect to your cloth, gentlemen, is it likely that one of your angels or a group of angels would lend support to a man like Guffy Mcgovern?
Is it possible that angels would aid and comfort such a man?
"If a man have a hundred sheep
"and one of them should go astray,
"doth he not leave the 99 in the mountains and go and seek that which is gone astray?"
Matthew, chapter 18, verse 12.
Besides, the lord isn't as small-minded as some of us mortals.
And now,
Mr. commissioner,
I had a short talk with rabbi Hahn in the elevator, and we both discovered we're seeing a ball game at 1:30, so if you don't mind...
No, of course not.
Uh, you'd better hurry.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Thank you.
If Dr. Blane would care to see me in my office,
I'd be very happy, indeed.
[Laughter]
Hey, fellas...
Where are you sitting?
[Both laugh]
Anything further that you'd like to add, Mr. Mcgovern?
Nothing.
Well, gentlemen, I have listened to both sides of this argument, and frankly, I'm baffled.
I'm sure we'd all like to believe in angels.
I know I would.
But if only I had just one tiny bit of concrete evidence.
However...
[Door opens]
Mr. commissioner?
Yes?
This is Bridget white.
She wants to testify for
Mr. Mcgovern.
Mr. commissioner, a minute ago you were all set to make a decision.
Let's get on with it.
I don't want anyone hammering away at this kid.
Sister, will you please get her out of here?
If the commissioner wants to hear about angels, he ought to ask someone who's seen them.
Mr. Mcgovern, what are you afraid of?
All right, you just sit right down here.
Uh...What is your name, little girl?
Bridget white.
8 years old.
Oh, yes. And where do you live, Bridget?
Saint Gabriel's home for orphan girls.
You believe in angels, don't you?
Doesn't everyone?
No.
No, they don't.
But I saw them...Twice.
And where did you think you saw these angels?
In the ballpark.
They were helping the pirates.
You're quite sure about that?
You wouldn't, uh, just make up a story, would you?
Oh, no.
It's bad to lie about anything.
But if you lied about angels,
I guess that'd be real trouble.
Mr. commissioner, may I question the witness?
Certainly, certainly, certainly.
Now, Bridget, when you, uh...
When you saw your, uh, angels, what were they doing?
Well, there was one standing behind
Mr. Mcgovern.
But, uh, you didn't see him talk to Mr. Mcgovern.
No. But I know he must have.
Why?
Because Mr. Mcgovern said so.
And you think that one of your angels, one of these heavenly messengers, would talk to a man like Mr. Mcgovern?
Of course. Any angel would be proud to talk to a nice man like Mr. Mcgovern.
[Laughter]
Commissioner:
Quiet. Quiet, please.
Is that all, sir?
Mr. commissioner,
I hope we're not going to accept this as testimony.
The child is obviously prejudiced.
What are you talking about?
I will decide what is evidence here.
Isn't it true that you tried to adopt this child?
Haven't you recently made a declaration of this intention to the orphans court?
Suppose I did.
What about it?
Why, Mr. Mcgovern...
There's nothing definite yet.
I don't even know if the court will let me have her.
You don't just walk in and adopt a child.
There's problems.
Oh, there's no problem here, Guffy.
Nevertheless, you wanted to adopt her.
Oh, that's nice.
It's touching!
The little girl who saw the angels now stands up to testify for
Mr. Mcgovern.
But isn't she actually testifying for papa?
Ooh!
Guffy!
Stop that!
Jenny:
Guffy!
[Thunder]
Commissioner: Order!
I said order.
Jenny:
Don't do it, Guffy!
[Shouting]
Jenny: Stop it!
Guffy, stop it!
Guffy! No!
[Shouting]
Jenny:
Guffy, don't!
Make him stop!
Guffy, don't!
Gentlemen, I think...
In view of the facts...
All things considered...
This case is dismissed.
What's with Guffy?
Read about it!
He got all his marbles?
Sure, sure.
He was ok all the time.
He ain't no more crazy than I am.
Hey, Guffy, here you are!
[All talking at once]
Come on, Mcgovern, what do you say?
That was a nice little fracas you staged, Mcgovern.
Quite a show.
Look, you heard what the fella said.
What else could I do?
You had no right to slug him.
I warned you about that twice.
Ok, keep your shirt-- keep your wings on, huh?
You talking to me?
Just stick to your driving, will ya?
I only hit him once or twice.
You completely destroyed his bridgework.
All right. I'm sorry.
Well, you ought to be because when you busted that bridgework, you also busted our agreement.
What do you mean?
We're through with you.
From now on, you're on your own.
Please! Don't make jokes!
I didn't say nothin'.
It's no joke.
We're all finished.
Look, a pennant's hanging on that game today.
You can't walk out on me now. I need you.
Kind of a shame, isn't it?
But don't worry.
You've been on your own a lot of times in the last eight weeks.
I don't like to be on my own.
I'm not happy on my own.
You used to be.
But I'll let you in on a little secret-- you've learned something, Guffy.
You don't know it yourself yet, but you've learned that there's more important things in life than winning ball games.
We're a little proud of you.
Don't be proud of me.
Just be at Forbes field at 1:30.
That's all I want.
Sorry, can't make it, and tell that cabdriver to slow down.
He's making me nervous.
It's a dirty trick.
Who'd ever think that an angel would stoop to such a lowdown, dirty-- so long, Guffy.
No, listen!
Good luck, boy.
Wait! Come back here a minute, will you?
[Horn honks]
How much do I owe you?
Nothing!
[Tires squeal]
You decided who's going to pitch yet?
The boys in the press box are asking.
They want to know who's going to pitch.
Hellman.
What?
I said Hellman!
Let's do it, boy.
[All shout at once]
Batteries for today's game-- for New York...
Barberry catching,
Toley pitching.
For Pittsburgh...
Baxter catching,
Hellman pitching.
No! Not Hellman!
Hellman?
And they say Mcgovern's not crazy. Ha!
Take care of the bullpen, will you?
Yeah, sure.
Do you see anything, honey?
Not yet.
Umpire:
Play ball!
The giants come to bat now with the score still nothing to nothing.
Hellman has managed to hang on for four innings, but it's just a question of time.
[Crowd cheering]
Strike!
And it's over the left-field wall for a home run.
Safe!
There's another hit.
A very close decision down there, but he's safe.
See any angels yet?
You're out!
You're out!
Out at first for a double play to end the inning.
Score--New York, 1,
Pittsburgh, nothing.
Mr. Hellman coming in off the mound.
Looks like a very tired man.
Come on, Vince, boy, let's go to work!
Get a hit, boy!
You're out!
All right, only one away.
Lay into it, Tony, boy!
Lay into it!
Ball.
All right, Lou, get in there, boy, let's go! Let's go!
Come on now, Lou!
Knock it out of the park!
Mandekic pulls up safe at second.
Two away, and rube Ronson coming up.
Rube hasn't had a hit yet.
All right, rube, let's get some runs, boy!
A long, hard-hit ball that bounced off the scoreboard for a home run.
Atta-boy, Ruben!
That's one for Milwaukee high!
Let's get out there and hold them! Come on!
How's it going?
I guess I can get three of them out.
Here we are, at the top of the ninth inning, the final frame with the score still
Pittsburgh, 2, New York, 1.
Hellman is taking the mound again for Pittsburgh, though he seems to be tiring badly.
This is the giants' last chance to tag him, and maybe they will.
One away, boy, one away!
Hellman's touching that arm again.
Seems to be giving him some trouble.
Either it's pain or those giant averages.
Umpire:
Take your base.
And he takes his base, hit by a pitched ball.
Well, Hellman seems to be losing control in there.
[Cheering]
Jumping high in the air and spearing the ball.
Two out, a man on first.
They're getting to him,
Guffy. He'll never make it.
Ball one!
Spectator:
Take him out!
Boo!
Boo!
Take him out!
Get him out of there!
Take him out!
Two men on now, first and second.
Two away.
The fans are yelling to take Hellman out.
Come on, take him out!
Get a pitcher!
Throw the bum out!
Get him out of there!
Take him out!
Get him out of there!
Take a walk back!
Take a walk!
Safe!
You're safe!
The throw was not in time, and all the runners are safe.
Three men on base, two out.
And those pirate fans are really mad now.
A hit could win this ball game.
Spectator: Go on,
Hellman, good-bye!
Get him out of there!
Go to the showers, bum!
Get him out of there!
Take him out!
Yank the bum!
Yank him!
Mcgovern has finally made up his mind to take Hellman out of the game, but, uh, it may be a little late.
What do you think, Saul?
Can you do it?
Well, I'm tired, but I'd sure like to try.
Spectator: Get that bum out of there!
Get a pitcher!
Get a pitcher!
It's your ball game.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Mcgovern has just pulled the bonehead play of his career.
He's leaving Hellman in.
Take him out of there!
Coming up to the plate now is Dobbie Roscalla, who leads the league in runs batted in.
If he bats one now,
Mr. Mcgovern had better leave town.
Strike!
A swing and a miss.
He never connected with that one.
Strike!
Strike two.
Roscalla steps up to the plate again.
It only takes one to hit it.
Hellman's taking his time.
He's a very tired pitcher right now.
Thanks, Guffy.
For what?
You're getting a good man.
Well, there you have it.
Uh...Final score--
Pittsburgh, 2, New York, 1, and, of course, a pennant for the pirates.
I hope
Mr. Mcgovern's angels are pleased with the way things turned out.
Are you happy up there, little angels?
Why don't you shut up?
It was really true, wasn't it?
Somebody must've helped me...
Not only on the ball field, either.
Look what I got.
I wonder who they were.
Walter Johnson...
John McGraw...
Christy Mathewson...
Eddie Collins...
Lou Gehrig...
Babe Ruth.
Great names.
Great guys.
Play ball!
All right, come on, hit it!
[Thud]
They're on now.
Now hear this!
Now hear this!
Reveille!
I repeat!
Reveille!
Attention all hands!
Because another cigarette butt...
...has been found in the container of the Captain's palm tree...
...there will be no movies again tonight.
That is all.
All right, hit the deck!
Rise and shine! Greet the new day!
Off your hock and grab your sock!
Okay, Chief, you've done your duty.
Now get your big fat cat out of here!
Now hear this!
Now hear this!
'C' and 'E' and 'S' divisions...
...and all pharmacist mates will air bedding today.
Positively!
Doc, what are you doin' up so early? l heard you were working cargo today, so l thought l'd get ready.
On days when work's to be done, l can always count on a big turnout at sick hall. l attract some very rare diseases on cargo day.
That day when they knew you had five ships to load...
...l was greeted with six more cases of ''beriberi''...
...''double beriberi'' this time.
So help me, l'm going down to the ship's library...
...and throw that old copy of Moby Dick overboard.
What are you giving them these days for ''double beriberi''?
Aspirin, what else?
Something wrong, Doug?
We missed you when you went on watch last night. l gave young Ensign Pulver another drink of alcohol in orange juice...
...and it inspired him to relate further amorous feats of his.
Did he tell you about the time he overwhelmed a 45-year-old maiden...
...by the simple tactic of being the first man in her life to ask her a direct question?
No, but some of the things he related positively bordered on the supernatural. l don't know what to do about young Pulver.
Perhaps l should report his record to the American Medical Association?
There is something wrong, isn't there? l've been up all night, Doc.
What's the matter? What is it? l saw something last night that just about knocked me out.
What happened? l was up on the bridge. l was just standing there looking out to sea. l couldn't bear look at that island anymore.
All of a sudden l noticed something, little black specks crawling across the horizon. l looked through the glasses and it was a formation of our ships...
...that stretched for miles.
Carriers, and battleships and cans.
A whole task force, Doc.
Why didn't you break me out? l've never seen a battleship.
They came out and passed within a half mile of that reef.
Carriers so big they blacked out half the sky.
Battlewagons sliding along, dead quiet. l could see the men on the bridges.
And this is what knocked me out, Doc:
Somehow...
...l thought l was on those bridges. l thought l was riding west across the Pacific. l watched 'em till they were out of sight.
And l was right there on those bridges all the time. l know how that must have hurt, Doug.
And then l looked down from our bridge and saw our captain's palm tree.
Our trophy for superior achievement!
The Admiral John J. Finchley Award for delivering...
...more toothpaste than toilet paper...
...than any other navy cargo ship in the safe area of the Pacific!
-Read this, Doc. See how it sounds.
-What is it?
My application for transfer. l've been rewriting it since l got off watch.
-Another?
-This one's different. l'm trying something new.
A stronger wording. Read it carefully.
''From Lieutenant J.G. Douglas Roberts to Bureau of Naval Personnel.
''April 16, 1945.
''Subject: Change of duty request form.''
-Boy, this is sheer poetry!
-Go on, Doc.
''For two years and four months l've served on this vessel as cargo officer.
''l feel my continued service aboard can only reduce my usefulness to the Navy...
''...and increase disharmony aboard this ship.''
How about that?
''lt is therefore urgently requested...
''...that l be ordered to combat duty, preferably aboard a destroyer.'' l've got a chance, haven't l?
Listen, Doug....
You've been sending in a letter every week for goodness knows how long.
Every week, the Captain screams like a stuck pig...
...''disapproves'' your letter and forwards it.
That's just my point, Doc.
He does forward it--
The captain of a Navy ship is the most absolute monarch left in this world. l know that. lf he endorsed any letters ''approved,'' your orders would come through like that.
But ''disapproved,'' you haven't a prayer.
You're stuck on this old bucket. Face it. lt's still a chance, Doc. lt's still a chance. l'm sorry you ever saw that task force. l've got to go down to my hypochondriacs.
-Good morning, Mr. Roberts.
-Good morning, Dowdy. lt's hotter up here than it is down in that mess hall.
Look at that cruddy island! Smell it! lt's so hot it already smells like a hog pen.
Think we'll get out of here today? l don't know. There are three LCMs coming alongside for supplies.
Are they getting up yet?
Yeah, they're startin' to stumble around down there, the poor, punch-drunk....
When are you goin' to the Captain again and ask him to give this crew a liberty?
These guys ain't been off this ship for over a year except on duty.
The last time l asked the Captain was last night.
-What'd he say?
-He said ''no''!
We've gotta get these guys ashore.
They're goin' Asiatic.
When you see him again, Mr. Roberts....
You know l will, Dowdy. ln the meantime, have Dolan type that up for me.
Your letter? Yes, sir.
Now hear this! Now hear this!
Sweepers, man your brooms.
Give her a clean sweep-down fore and aft.
Sweep down all ladders and all passageways.
Do not throw trash over the fantail.
Now sick call will commence immediately.
Now.
When l woke up this morning--
And remembered you were working cargo.
Continue.
Honest, Doc, l couldn't even straighten up. l guess it's the old appendix again.
That appendix of yours certainly gets around.
Now it's on the wrong side.
Two aspirin! Mark for duty. Next.
Aspirin? For a floating appendix, Doc?
Yeah, it's the latest thing. l'll have one with you. Next!
Well, where do you hurt? lt's my head, Doc. lt's my head.
Dizzy? lt's terrible!
Ringing in your ears?
-Well, l mean it's all the time, Doc.
-Like bells?
That's it, Doc, like bells!
Like that, Doc.
How do they go, ''dong-dong,'' ''ding-ding,'' or ''ding-dong''? lt's important.
''Ding-dong''? ''Dong-ding''?
No second guessing. Too bad.
They should go ''dong-dong.''
One aspirin! Mark for duty.
There is now available at the ship's store a small supply of peanut brittle.
The ship's store will be open from 1300 to 1315. lnsigna, l've got a real special job for you.
You stay right here and clean these binoculars for the bridge.
Let me work up forward, Chief. l don't want to be around this crud,
Mannion.
-Yeah, Chief, take lnsigna with you.
-Get lost!
Cut it out, the both of you! l'm tired of you two bellyachin'!
Now go on and get scrapin'!
Which end of these binoculars do you look through? l guess it's optional, lnsigna. lt depends on what size eyeball you've got.
What time would it be in San Francisco?
About midnight last night.
Midnight last night?
The Japs must have took over that island!
There's a red and white flag on that new building.
Japs? We ain't been within 5,000 miles of any Japs.
Japs, you hear that, Wiley?
Smart, ain't he?
That's a hospital flag.
They've got a fancy building on that island.
Yeah, they've got big windows and--
Holy Cow!
Holy Cow! They've got nurses on that island!
That nurse, she's taking a shower!
Look! On the second story.
She's a blonde! See?
-Get off my back!
-Knock it off! l've never seen such a beautiful girl!
She sure is taking a long time in that shower.
Yeah, honey....
Come on over here by the window!
How do you use this thing?
There's another one over by the wash basin taking a shampoo!
Oh, she's got a bathrobe on.
What a stupid way to take a shampoo, with a bathrobe on!
What's stupid about it?
Do you think she wants to--
-Wow!
-Please, fellas! Come on!
-Didn't l tell you she was beautiful?
-Yeah, man! l can't even see the island.
Well, so long, blondie!
There goes the other one! lmagine that pig not takin' a shower?
Come on, girls, who's next? l'm getting it! l'm getting it, yeah!
But there ain't no one in there now.
Hey, try mine!
They must think we got nothing better to do than stand here.
Do you see anything?
No, you've been panting on the lens.
These glasses is gettin' heavy!
We're wasting manpower. Let's take turns. l'll take the first watch.
Look!
There goes a sea gull.
Look at 'em now, will you!
See anything, Mannion?
They're gone.
Why, you dirty miserable cheat!
Oh, it's too bad! There were three a minute ago. One was about to take--
Peepin' Tom.
Knock it off! lnsigna, did you hear me? Knock it off!
Wiley, get out of here!
Stop it! l'll kill him! Do you hear me? l'll kill him!
All right. Get below, all of you, and slosh your heads!
Hold it right there, Mister!
What's that man doing on deck without a shirt? l was just speaking to him about that,
Captain. l want that man put on report. l don't want no one on deck without a shirt. ls that clearly understood?
All right, keep your shirt on.
All of you.
Last night, down in the compartment, l stopped three of them fights...
...worse than that.
They've gotta have a liberty, Mr. Roberts.
Yeah, they sure do.
Call a boat for me. l'm going ashore.
-What are you gonna do?
-l just got a new angle.
You're not goin' over the Captain's head?
No, l'm goin' around his end.
Get the lead out, Dowdy.
''lf l could be with you
One hour tonight
''lf l was free to do
The things l might
''l'm tellin' you true l'd be anything but blue
''lf l could be with you''
Hey, what's new, Doug boy? l'm going to take a launch over to the island.
Over to the island?
Hey, how would you like some company? l'll go get some aspirin for Doc at the new hospital they're building.
What's the matter?
Why, Frank Thurlowe Pulver...
...you mean to say you'd be willing to unglue yourself from that sack...
...to do a favor for someone else?
Let's not have any more of that usual attitude towards Pulver boy! l said one simple thing--
Okay, Frank, okay. Hurry up.
Just in case, Pulver boy. Just in case!
See you later, Doug boy.
Welcome aboard!
Oh, my goodness! Attention!
This is gonna be all right. You girls just got in here, huh? Where're you from?
No, don't tell me. Let me guess.
How many of you girls are there?
Captain, aren't you gonna answer our salute?
Sure, yeah. lf it'll make you feel any happier.
We thought maybe we were doing it wrong, Captain.
You see, we haven't had much experience.
Well, that's wonderful. ls that your battleship in the harbor, Captain?
Not exactly. No. ls there anything you want? l mean, anything in particular?
No. Nothing l can think of, in particular.
Oh, aspirin! What am l saying? l've got a requisition right here.
All right, right this way.
Get back to work, men.
Carry on, men.
-l'm actually not captain of that AK.
-No kidding. l'm the Exec.
-Certainly must have a lot of ''b.f.''
-Who me? What do you mean--
Battle fatigue. With all this aspirin.
Seen a lot of action?
Well, l sure as heck haven't seen much action this past year.
You mean battle action?
Well, l got a little shrapnel in my left leg. lt gives me a twinge now and then.
-l hear that scotch works wonders.
-You like scotch? l was acquiring a taste for it before they shipped us out.
-Here is your aspirin.
-Thanks.
Would you like to come out to the ship this afternoon?
Sorry. lt just so happens l have a bottle of Red Label in my cabin.
Have a shore boat at the dock at 1800 minus ten.
Oh, will l? 1800 minus ten.
-That's ten minutes to six.
-Yeah. l see l caught your interest. l don't want these other girls to hear, but if you were to come over alone...
...this afternoon....
Here's your letter. l typed it up.
Just sign your old John Henry here and l'll take it to the Captain.
Then hold your ears. Mr. Roberts? lt's only you, Ensign Pulver.
What are you doing in Mr. Roberts' locker?
There was a shoebox in there somewhere. l can't find it.
Somebody stole it, that's all.
There's just nothin' they'll stop at!
Broken right into the sanctity of a man's own locker! ls Mr. Roberts back from the island yet?
As soon as he gets back, have him sign this baby.
What is it? lt's the best letter
Mr. Roberts wrote yet. lt's gonna blow the old man right through the overhead!
This letter's liable to get him transferred.
-Let me see that.
-Get a load of this line right here.
''lncrease disharmony aboard this ship.''
Ain't that a kick? l can't wait to jab this baby in the old man's face.
You know how he gets sick when he gets extra mad at Mr. Roberts.
When l deliver this letter, l'm gonna take along a wastebasket.
Let me know when Mr. Roberts gets back. lt was the most vicious fight you ever saw in your life.
Even after Dowdy and l broke up the fight, l figured l had to do something right away.
Frank, has Dolan been in here with my letter? l don't know, Doug boy. l just came in here myself.
Doug, you don't know anyone on that island, do you?
Yeah, the port director. The guy who decides where to send this ship next.
A liberty port, for instance.
Dowdy tipped me off. He used to drink a quart of scotch every day of his life.
You didn't give that shoebox to that port director? l did, compliments of the Captain.
You've been hoarding a quart of scotch in a shoebox? l was gonna break it out the day l get off this ship.
Resurrection day!
You wasted that bottle of scotch on a man?
Will you name me another sex within 1,000 miles?
What's eating you anyway, Frank?
Well, look at the fancy pillows!
-Somebody expecting company?
-Good Lord!
'' Toujours l'amour.''
''Souvenir of San Diego.'' ''Oh, you kid! ''
''Tonight or never.''
''Compliments of the American Harvester Company.''
''We plow deep while others sleep.''
Doc, that new hospital hasn't got nurses, has it? lt didn't have yesterday. lt has today.
How did you find out that they were there? lt just came to me all of a sudden. l was lying on my bunk here this morning, thinking.
And there wasn't a breath of air.
All of a sudden a funny thing happened.
A little breeze came up. l took a big deep breath and said to myself:
''Pulver boy, there's women on that island! ''
Doc, you know a thing like that could make a bird dog real self-conscious.
They flew in last night. Knockouts!
And one big blonde especially. Of course, she went for me right away. Naturally.
So l started to turn on the old personality, and l said:
''Will nothing make you come out to the ship with me?''
And she said,
''Yes, there is one thing and one thing only:
''A good stiff drink of scotch.'' l'm sorry, Frank. l'm really sorry.
Your first assignment in a year. l was gonna bring her right in here. l had all my old pillows out. l'd slip her a couple of fast slugs of scotch and....
Without that scotch she wouldn't--
She just wouldn't, that's all!
Doc, let's make some scotch.
Scotch?
As naval officers, we're supposed to be resourceful.
Frank here's got a great opportunity.
Let's fix him up.
Right.
Frank, where is the rest of that alcohol we were drinking last night?
-Now, that ain't even the right color.
-Quiet, boy.
Color?
Coke. You got any? l haven't seen a Coke in four months.
No, it's five months. l forgot l had it.
What shade would you like?
Shade?
Pale, smokey?
Well, l told her Red Label.
-Red Label?
-Red Label. lt may look like it, but it sure won't taste like it.
Doc, what does scotch taste like? lt tastes like....
You know what it's always tasted a little like to me? lodine.
Of course.
One drop of iodine, for taste.
Let me try that.
This calls for a medical opinion.
How about it?
We're on the right track.
Now we need something extra for age.
What have you got there, Doug?
Seltzer, some fruit salts, hair tonic....
Hair tonic! That's got a coal tar base.
One drop of hair tonic, for age.
That'll age the daylights out of it.
That's it!
You know, it does taste a little like scotch.
Do you know, it does.
That dumb little blonde will never know the difference!
All right, Frank,
Doug and l made the scotch...
...the nurse is your department.
''She won't know the difference
She won't know the difference''
Thanks, Doc.
''She'll never know the difference''
You won't know the difference, will you, baby?
No, you won't. No, you won't.
Thank you, Doc. Thanks, Doug.
Gee, you guys are wonderful to me.
Don't mention it. l think you almost deserve it.
You do really? Or are you just givin' me the old needle again?
What do you really think of me? Honestly.
Frank, l like you.
There's no getting around the fact you're a real likeable guy.
-But....
-But what?
Well, l also think you're the most hapless, lazy...
...disorganized and, in general, the most lecherous person...
...l've ever known in my life.
-l am not!
-You're not what? l'm not disorganized.
Have you ever in your life finished one thing you set out to do?
You sleep 16 hours a day.
You pretend you want me to improve your mind, but you've not finished a book...
-...l've given you to read.
-l finished God's Little Acre. l didn't give you that.
He's been reading God's Little Acre for over a year now.
He's underlined every erotic passage and added exclamation points.
And after a certain pornographic climax he's inserted the words: ''Well written! ''
You're the laundry and morale officer. l doubt if you've ever seen the laundry! l was down there last week!
-And you're scared of the Captain.
-l am not!
Then why do you hide in the passageway every time you see him coming? l am not. l'm scared of myself.
Scared of what l might do to him.
What you might do to him!
He lies in his sack all day long and bores me silly...
...with great moronic plots against the Captain.
He's never carried out one of them.
-l haven't, huh?
-No, Frank, you haven't.
Whatever happened to those marbles you were gonna put in the Captain's overhead...
...so they'd roll around all night and keep him awake?
Now you've gone too far!
Now you've asked for it!
What does that look like?
Five marbles. l've got another one in my pocket.
Six...
...marbles. l'm looking for marbles all day long!
You asked me what l thought of you.
Well, l'll tell you.
The day you finish one thing you've started to do...
...the day you actually put those marbles in the Captain's overhead...
...then have the guts to knock on his door and say...
...''Captain, l put those marbles there! ''...
...that's the day l'll have some respect for you.
That's the day l'll look up to you as a man.
Okay?
Okay.
Where's Dolan with my letter? l'm gonna go find him.
Wait a minute, Doug. l wouldn't send a letter like that in if l were you.
You'll get yourself in trouble saying things like ''disharmony aboard this ship.''
You know, if you did say ''disharmony,'' or ''harmony'' or....
-Where's that letter?
-l don't know.
What's the big idea? l just wanted to talk to you before you signed it.
Please don't sign that letter, Doug.
Now, please don't.
They'll transfer you.
You'll get your can shot off, boy.
Doc, will you tell him what you told me last night, about how stupid he is?
Yes, Doc. Maybe you'd like to tell me to my face.
Yes, l would.
You are stupid, Doug, and l can prove it.
You quit medical school just to get into this thing...
...when you could be saving lives today.
Why?
Has it ever occurred to you that the guys fighting this war...
...might also be saving lives?
Your's and mine, for instance. l'd rather practice that kind of medicine.
That's exactly what you're doing!
Are you kidding?
Look, whether you like it or not, this sorry old bucket does a necessary job.
And you're the guy who keeps lumbering along. lt could be that right here on this bucket...
...you're deeper and more truly in this war than you'd ever--
Doc, in a minute you'll start quoting
Ralph Waldo Emerson.
That is a lousy thing to say.
We've got nothing to do with the war.
Maybe that's why we're on this ship, because we're not good enough to fight.
'Cause our glands don't secrete enough adrenaline or...
...our great-great-grandmothers were afraid of the dark or something.
What is it you want to be? A hero?
Hero? You haven't heard a word l've said!
Look, the war's way out there and l'm here. l don't want to be here. l want to be out there. l'm sick and tired of being a lousy spectator. l just happen to believe in this thing and l want to feel l'm good enough to be in it.
Good enough! Doug, you're good enough. lt's just that you haven't the opportunity.
That's mostly what makes physical heroism: opportunity. lt's a reflex. l think that 75 out of 100 young males have that reflex.
You take any one of them, say even Frank Thurlowe Pulver here...
...put him into a B-29 over in Japan and do you know what you'd have?
No, l don't, Doctor.
Pulver, as a Congressional Medal of Honor winner.
Pulver, who single-handed shot down
23 attacking Zeros.
Pulver, who with bare hands held together the severed wing stretch of his plane...
...and with bare feet successfully landed his mortally wounded plane on his home field! lt's reflex.
Like the knee jerk.
Strike the patellar tendon in a human being and you produce the knee jerk. Look.
What's the matter, Doc?
Nothing. But stay out of B-29s,
Frank, my boy.
You've made your point very vividly, Doc...
...but l still want to get in this thing. l'm gonna keep on sending in these letters until l do.
-Yes, l know you are, Doug.
-l haven't got much time.
That task force l saw was on its way to start our last big push in the Pacific. l'm gonna catch it.
LCM's coming alongside.
Will Mr. Roberts report topside immediately?
Mr. Roberts! Topside!
Doc, what are you gonna give Doug for his birthday? l hadn't thought of giving him anything. l'm gonna show him that he's got old Pulver figured out all wrong!
What does that look like to you?
Just what it is. The cardboard center of a roll of toilet paper.
-l suppose it doesn't look like a firecracker?
-No, it doesn't.
And l suppose that doesn't look like a fuse? lt looks like a piece of string.
You just wait until old Pulver gets through with it! l'm gonna get me some black powder from that gunner's mate and--
Oh, no! This is not gonna be any peanut of a firecracker. l'll pack that thing solid with that stuff they use to blow up bridges:
Fulminate of mercury!
Boy, on the night of Doug's birthday...
...l'm gonna throw that under the old man's bunk and bam!
Captain, it's me! lt is l, Ensign Pulver! l just threw the firecracker under your stinking bunk!
The Captain wants you to hang on to whatever fresh fruit you have left.
He wants it for his own mess.
Better get braced for a storm, Mr. Roberts.
Dolan took in your letter a while back.
Stand by bow line, ready to cast off!
You fellas squared away?
Thanks, Lieutenant. You wouldn't want to swap movies, would you?
-Sure, what you got?
-Hoot Gibson in The Sheriff's Daughter.
Shove off.
LCM-2, come alongside.
Hey, Chief! Copper just passed out.
Get him up here!
Give him to me.
Easy boy, easy. lt's murder down there, Mr. Roberts.
Can't we take our shirts off?
Sure, take them off.
Kennedy, give Mannion a hand.
Get him back to Sick Bay.
Go on, take your shirts off.
Thank you, sir.
The boat, watch it!
Dowdy, get a defender over.
The Captain wants to see you on the bridge.
Tell him l'm busy.
Slammer, give him a hand on that line!
Watch it!
This is what they want.
''One ton dry stores, one gross dundries...
''...20 cartons toothpaste,
1 /4 ton frozen food.
''Fresh fruit, if available.'' Scratch that.
They've been out two months.
-No fresh fruit in two months?
-No, sir.
Give them a couple of crates of oranges, compliments of the Captain.
Sling ready, sir.
Take it away.
All right, Mister!
We'll have this out right here and now.
What do you mean telling me you're too busy?
We were having trouble.
You didn't want me leaving the deck with a ship coming--
When l tell you l want to see you, l mean now!
Mister, l mean jump!
Understand?
Yes, sir. l'll remember that next time.
You'd better remember!
You think you're pretty cute with this letter...
-...trying to get me in bad with the Admiral.
-l'm not, Captain.
What do you mean writing
''disharmony aboard this ship''?
Because it's true, Captain.
Any disharmony aboard this ship is my own doing!
That's true, too, Captain.
And it ain't gonna be any letter that leaves this ship.
Any criticism of this ship stays on this ship! l've got a good reputation with the Admiral and l ain't gonna lose it on account of...
...any letter written by some smart aleck college officer!
You retype this.
Cut out that ''disharmony'' crack and l'll send it in.
But this is the last one, understand?
Every man in the Navy has the right to send in a request for transfer.
No one can change their wording.
That's the Navy regulations.
How about that, Dolan?
That's what it says in the book, sir.
Well, it's a stupid regulation!
We wouldn't stand for it in the Merchant Marine, l tell you.
All right, l'll send this one in. Just as it is.
But ''disapproved,'' like l always do.
But there's one thing l don't have to send...
...and that's a letter that hasn't been written.
And, Mister, l'm telling you here and now, you ain't gonna write any more.
You bring me one more and you'll regret it the rest of your days.
You've got a job right here.
And, Mister, you ain't never gonna get off this ship!
Now get on with your work.
Where are your shirts?
Where are your shirts?
-Captain--
-Shut up!
Where are your shirts?
Get those shirts on and be quick about it! l'm sorry, put your shirts on.
Just one minute, Mister!
Who's captain of this vessel?
That is the rankest piece of insubordination l ever seen.
You've been getting pretty smart lately, buttering up to Mr. Roberts here.
But this time you have gone too far!
And l'm making you a little promise. l am never going to forget this.
And as a starter, you're on report.
Every one of you who appeared on deck without a shirt, on report!
You're not putting these men on report.
-What do you mean l'm not?
-l'm responsible. l gave them permission.
You disobeyed my standing order?
Thanks a million for the fresh fruit,
Lieutenant!
You gave that man oranges?
Yes, sir, l'm afraid l did.
Ten days! You just got yourself ten days in your quarters! Ten days!
Do you relieve me here?
You heard me. You get to your cabin before l make it 20 days!
Another launch alongside, Mr. Roberts.
You want it port or starboard? l've been relieved, Chief.
Where do you think you're going?
To my room for ten days. Or was it 20? l'll tell you when to get to your cabin!
Get back to your job!
-Captain, you told me--
-Never mind what l told you. l'm telling you.
Who is that officer? You, boy!
Yes, you. Come here.
Are you one of my officers?
Yes, sir.
What's your name again?
Ensign Pulver, sir. l'm glad to see there's someone aboard this vessel who knows how to salute.
How is it l don't see you around much,
Pulver? l've often wondered the same thing myself, sir.
What's your job?
Officer in charge of laundry and morale, sir.
How long have you been aboard?
Fourteen months, sir.
Fourteen months!
Spend most of your time in the laundry, huh?
Yes, sir. Most of the time.
-You do a very good job.
-Thank you, sir.
-Except for one thing.
-Sir? l don't like starch in my pajamas.
-You'll watch out for that, won't you?
-Yes, sir.
Fine. You're doing very good work, Pulver.
You must come to my cabin sometime and have dinner.
Cut it out, Doug. Now knock it off!
Cut it out! He's got his nerve.
Wait till next week, Doug, when he gets his laundry.
Doug, l'm gonna get some starch.
You know, some of that real thick starch...
...like they use on nurses' uniforms--
And when old Roberts said that, l thought the Captain was gonna lose his marbles!
Nothing stops old Roberts!
Nice goin', Mr. Roberts. lt was really beautiful the way you read the old man off.
You're gonna send in another one next week?
He sure is! And it's my turn to shove it right under the old man's nose.
Yeah, but you've got a promotion coming up, haven't you?
But could he stop that?
Promotion? This is Mr. Roberts!
You think he gives a good hoot about another lousy stripe?
We've gotta write a real hot one next week, huh, Mr. Roberts?
We'll use asbestos paper.
He'll fix the old man's clock. You wait!
All men who have not been put on report for three weeks...
...can now go swimming for ten minutes.
That is all.
How do l look?
You don't mind me borrowing your binoculars, do you? lt's okay, Frank.
Won't they get in your way?
Now hear this!
Now hear this!
Station launch coming alongside....
She's here! Now you guys stay away from that cabin.
Last one in is an ensign!
Your permission to come aboard, sir?
Where's the skipper?
Never mind, l'll find him.
-Request permission to come aboard, sir.
-Permission granted.
Hop aboard.
-Request permission to come aboard, sir.
-Permission granted.
Request permission to come aboard, sir.
Request permission to come aboard, sir.
Request permission to come aboard, sir.
Request permission to come aboard, sir.
Well, that's all.
Cobinna had to wash her hair but she'd just love to come another time.
How would you girls like to look around the ship...
...while the Lieutenant and l discuss a little business?
Men, the nurses! l wouldn't think of leaving them unprotected!
Right this way. Pardon me. Right up here.
That's it. There we are, right here.
-This is Doc. Girls, Mr. Roberts.
-Hi!
Ensign Pulver is executive officer.
What's your job?
Laundry and morale officer.
Glad to have you aboard.
Oh, are you laundry and morale? So am l!
Why don't you just take the girls off somewhere and tell them all about it?
Gee, l wish l could. But l've gotta clean up. l did a lot of laundry today.
Sure.
Maybe Doc will show them Surgery.
Oh, Doc, oh yeah.
Girls, this is our surgeon.
You just go right off with Doc.
Don't let the grey hair and the baggy eyes bother you.
He's a very likeable--
He has a great sense of humor. l'd be delighted to take these young ladies of the medical profession to my Surgery.
But unfortunately we haven't had a chance to clean up since our last enemy action.
Come on, let's see the ship!
Flemish up the lines out there, will you, Dowdy?
-What?
-Yeah. New man....
More salt, Cookie.
Put some more salt in there.
Now, girls, up here is where we have the--
Follow me right up here, girls.
Now, girls, this is the uh....
That's a gun.
-lmagine.
-ls this the poop deck?
You boys must be the lookouts?
Could l borrow these?
Sorry, sir. lt's top secret.
Captain's orders, Miss. You know, bifocals.
-l can make an exception in your case.
-Thank you.
Look at the fish jumping over there! lt's a whale!
-A real interesting cloud formation!
-Where?
You can see your hospital right from over the rail here.
Ensign Pulver!
Hey, l can!
Why, you can almost reach out and--
Glasses.
Well, you certainly can see Cobinna!
We've gotta get back and hang those window curtains right away!
Ten hut!
Right, haste!
Forward, march!
So long, harmless. l was just getting the hang of this thing!
Now we've got nothing to look forward to!
Just that same cruddy island!
You gotta rub it in?
Why don't you shut up?
You gonna make me?
-How'd you find out?
-We seen them taking a bath.
Through this glass, Mr. Roberts, we could see all of them.
You heard what she said.
They're gonna hang some curtains.
Them nurses was pretty to look at!
They've got a ten minute boat ride.
You've still got ten minutes.
Yeah, but it wouldn't be any fun when you know you're gonna be rushed.
This is the first real good day this bucket's ever had. lt's all over now.
Maybe you've got time now to listen to a little piece of news.
''When in all respects ready for sea, on or about 1600 today...
''...the AK-601 will proceed at ten knots to Elysium lsland...
''...arriving there in seven days, reporting to the port director for cargo assignment.
''During its stay in Elysium the ship will make maximum use...
''...of the recreational facilities of this port.''
That means liberty!
-That don't mean liberty?
-That's exactly what it means.
Somebody must have been drunk to send us to a liberty port.
-The old man seen them orders?
-Saw them before l did.
Elysium, where is that?
''Elysium is the largest of the Limbo lslands.
''lt's often referred to as the Polynesian paradise.
''Vanilla, sugar, cocoa, coffee, phosphates and rum are the chief exports.''
Rum! Did you hear that?
''Elysium City, its capital, is a beautiful metropolis...
''...of palm-lined boulevards, handsome public buildings and colorful stucco homes.
''Since 1900, its population has remained remarkably constant at about 30,000.''
Wait till we get there!
Go on, Mr. Roberts, go on.
''Elysium harbor, offering excellent anchorage and docking facilities...
''...is surrounded on three sides by beautiful, green, cloud-covered hills.
''The natives are noted for their congeniality and hospitality.''
Nice port, huh, Mr. Roberts?
We finally made it, Mr. Roberts!
You! On deck. Off.
Get them cannibals off this vessel!
Get them off!
Chief, will you tie this? lt's been so long, l sort of forgot.
What are you gonna do when you get ashore?
Kid will probably go to the first saloon. lce cream saloon, eh, Booksie? l haven't thought much about it. l've got my camera Ma sent me. l guess l'll just wander around.
Hey, Lindstrom! l've got good news for you.
You can take off them liberty whites. l ain't got the duty tonight!
That's right. You and Mr. Roberts got the duty tonight.
Now hear this!
Here we go! Here we go!
This is the Captain speaking. l just found out that there's men on this vessel expecting liberty.
I don't know how this rumor got around, but I'd like to clear it up right now.
On account of cargo requirements and security conditions...
...which have just come to my personal attention...
...there will be no liberty while in this here port!
That is all.
Come in, Mr. Roberts.
Twenty-eight seconds! Pretty good time.
You see, l've been expecting you.
Okay, when does this crew get liberty? ln the first place, just kindly hold your tongue. l'm still Captain here.
-When are you gonna let this crew ashore?
-l'm not. lt was not my idea coming to this liberty port. lt seems one of my officers arranged it with a certain port director.
Gave him a bottle of scotch whiskey, compliments of the Captain.
The port director was kind enough to send me a thank-you note...
...along with our order.
Sit down, Mr. Roberts.
Now l admit l was a little provoked about not being consulted...
...then l got to thinking maybe we ought to come to this port...
...so as you and me could have a talk.
All right. Take it out on me, but not the men.
Don't you hear that music?
Don't you know it's tearing the guys apart?
They're breakable, Captain! l promise you.
Now you listen to me. l've got two things l want to show you.
That is the cap of a full commander. l'm going to wear that cap some day, and you're going to help me. lt won't do any harm to tell you that you helped me win that palm tree...
...by working cargo.
Don't let this go to your head.
When Admiral Finchley awarded me that palm tree, he said:
''You've got a good cargo officer.
Keep him at it. You're going places.''
And l went right out and bought that hat.
And nobody is gonna stand between me and that hat!
Certainly not you.
Now last week it was agreed...
...that there was to be no more of these ''disharmony'' letters. l didn't say that.
And what do l find on my desk this morning? Another one. lt says here, ''friction between me and the commanding officer.''
That ain't goin' in, Mister.
How are you gonna stop it? l ain't.
You are.
Just how much do you want this crew to have a liberty?
Enough to stop this ''friction''?
Enough to stop writing letters ever?
'Cause that's the only way this crew is going to get ashore...
...this day or any other day.
Now we've had our little chat.
What do you say?
How did you get in the Navy?
How did you get on our side?
You ignorant, arrogant, ambitious...!
Keeping 62 men in prison...
...'cause you got a palm tree for the work they did! l don't know which l hate worse, you or that other malignant growth--
How'd you ever get to be commander of a ship? l realize in war time they have to scrape the bottom of the barrel...
...but where'd they ever scrape you up?
There's just one thing left for you, Mister.
A general court-martial!
Fine, court-martial me! l'm asking for it! lf l can't get transferred, l'll get court-martialed! l'm fed up!
You'll need a witness.
Call your messenger. l'll say it over again in front of him.
Go on, call him. You want me to call him?
You're a smart boy, Roberts.
But l know how to take care of smart boys. l hate your guts, you smart college guys! l've been seeing your kind around since l was ten years old, working as a busboy.
''Oh, busboy, it seems my friend has thrown up on the table.
''Clean up that mess, boy, will you?''
And then when l went to sea as a steward, people poking at you with umbrellas.
''Oh, boy! You, boy!
Careful with that luggage, boy! ''
And l took it. l took it for years!
But l don't have to take it anymore.
There's a war on and l'm Captain of this vessel. Now you can take it for a change.
The worst l can do to you is to keep you right here, Mister!
And here is where you're going to stay!
Now, get out!
What do you want for liberty, Captain?
You are through writing letters ever.
Okay.
And that's not all.
You're through talking back to me in front of the crew.
When l give an order, you jump!
-ls that all, Captain?
-No.
Anyone know you're in here?
No one.
Good.
Then you're not to go blabbing this around to anyone ever.
Might not sound so good. l don't want you to take credit for getting this--
You think l'm doing this for credit?
-You think l'd let anyone know?
-l've gotta make sure.
-You've got my word, that's all.
-Your word!
You college boys make such a great show of keeping your word.
Now hear this!
This is the Captain speaking. l've got further word on the subject of liberty. lt gives me great pleasure to announce liberty for the starboard section--
The whole crew, or there's no deal! l mean it.
Correction. Liberty for the entire crew will commence immediately.
You don't have to tell them again.
They heard you.
Look at those crazy bugs!
Listen to them! l've got a bunch of real beauties for you this time!
-Can they walk?
-Walk?
Some of them can't even crawl.
Well, they're peaceful anyhow.
All right, lads. Come on, lend a hand.
Hiya, Mr. Roberts!
Evening, Mr. Roberts!
-Duty officer, sir.
-That's right.
Colonel Middleton presents his compliments to the Captain, sir...
...and wishes him to know that these men made a shambles...
...of the Colonel's testimonial dinner-dance.
You men crashed a dance for Army personnel?
Yes, sir.
And they made us feel unwelcome.
The Army started a fight, huh?
No, sir, we started it.
And we finished it.
Tell Mr. Roberts how many of you
Army bums is in the hospital.
Thirty-eight soldiers of the U.S. Army have been hospitalized.
And the Colonel himself has a very bad bruise on his left shin.
That's not all, Lieutenant.
There were young ladies present,
50 of them...
...from the finest families of Elysium.
Well, sir....
Two of these young women were somewhat mauled.
One of them actually got a black eye.
Six others had their clothes torn from them.
They ran screaming into the night.
They haven't been heard from since.
What are you going to do about it? l'm due to be relieved here in 15 minutes. l'd be glad to lead a search party.
No, sir, the Army will take charge of that end.
Colonel Middleton will want to know what punishment you'll give these men.
You tell him l'm sure our captain will think of something.
-But, sir--
-That's all, Sergeant.
-Thank you, sir.
-Good night!
-So long, you guys!
-See you around.
What have you got to say for yourselves?
Okay if we go ashore again?
What do you say, Doc?
-Anybody got a fractured skull?
-No!
They pass the physical.
Go and take a shower and get into some clothes.
We've just got time to get back to the dance!
Hey, Mr. Roberts! l'm drunk as a goat!
Show him how drunk l am!
Mr. Roberts, when l first saw her she was eating.
And you know, she just ate her way into my heart.
She was eating a little old palm tree!
There you are, kid! Chow!
Wait a minute!
What's her name?
-l don't know, sir.
-She's got a nameplate.
Her name is....
''Property of.''
What's her last name?
Her last name?
''Rear Admiral Wentworth.''
Okay, hit the sack. l'll take care of her.
Okay, Mr. Roberts.
See that she gets a good square meal!
Come on, baby.
Hey, Kennedy, where you been?
Okay, you're relieved.
Request permission to go ashore, sir.
Did one of your men turn up with a--
Oh, there she is!
Thanks. Come on. Come on.
Your papa's over there worried about you.
Say, Mr. Roberts, where's your relief?
He'll be along any minute now.
Any minute now.
What are you looking so cocky about?
Am l looking cocky?
Maybe it's because for the first time since l've been on this ship, l'm seeing a crew.
What do you think you were living with all this time?
With 62 separate guys.
There's a big difference. Now in one night, these guys are bound together. l think now maybe they're strong enough to stand...
...all the miserable, endless days ahead of us. l only hope l'm strong enough.
Tomorrow you and l are going over there...
...to take advantage of the groundwork that's been laid tonight.
You and l are going to give ourselves a liberty.
Get a load of Pulver.
Hello Frank, how was your liberty?
''l'm telling you true l'd be anything but blue
''lf l could be with you''
All right, you men know your posts.
Officer of the deck? l hope you don't mind, but l've stationed my men along your starboard side. l'm sorry, but this ship is restricted for the rest of its stay in Elysium.
Your captain is to report to the island commander at 7:00 this morning. l recommend that he's there on time.
The Admiral is a pretty tough cookie when he's mad.
He's madder now then l ever seen him.
What in particular did this?
A little while ago, six men from your ship...
...broke into the home of the French colonial governor...
...and started throwing things through a plate-glass living-room window.
We found some of the things on the lawn.
A large world globe...
...a small love seat, a lot of books...
...and a bust of Balzac...
...the French writer.
We also found an Army private, first class...
...who was unconscious at the time.
He claims they threw him, too.
-Through the window?
-That's right. lt seems he took him there for a little joke.
He didn't tell him it was the governor's house.
He told them it was a....
Well, what we call in Alabama--
We call it the same thing in Nebraska.
That's about all, Lieutenant. lf it makes you feel any better,
Admiral Wentworth says...
...this is the worst ship he's ever seen in his entire naval career!
-Good night, Lieutenant.
-Night.
Schlemmer, are you all right?
Get up here, you idiot!
What are you trying to do?
Get up here! l forgot my motorcycle!
Come back here!
Kicked out! Kicked out!
The first time l've ever been kicked out of a port!
You're going to pay for this!
Now get the gangway up and we're going to get out of here.
Chief, bring in the gangway.
We've been kicked out of port.
Bookser ain't aboard, sir.
He didn't come back last night.
Get that gangway up, Mister!
And l mean now!
Yes, sir.
Come on, Booksie! Come on! l'm surprised at you!
Yes, sir, so am l.
Where did you meet her?
-At a church social.
-All night?
We went for a walk down on the beach.
We sat there and counted the stars.
Honest, sir, that's all.
-Better get below.
-Yes, sir.
All present and accounted for, sir.
Right here, Mister.
Well, l guess you're mighty proud of yourselves...
...getting me kicked out of port, that way.
Well, we are going to erase this blot from my record...
...if we have to work 24 hours a day!
Right, Mr. Roberts?
Yes, sir.
We are going to move more cargo than we ever moved before.
-Right, Mr. Roberts?
-Yes, sir.
Mr. Roberts is going to see to it...
...that you men tow the line at all times.
That's right, too...
...isn't it, Mister?
That's right, sir.
You know as well as l do...
...that Mr. Roberts is a man who keeps his word.
And, Roberts, you do a good job...
...and one of these days there may be a promotion in it for you.
An extra little bar on that collar.
That'd be all right, wouldn't it, Mister?
Wouldn't that be all right, Roberts?
Yes, sir, if you say so.
You just heard me say so!
Take over.
See they work up a sweat. l just gave an order and l ain't heard no answer! l'm waiting.
Aye, aye, sir.
That's better.
That's more like it.
Deck division, bring out the chippers and scrapers and get after that rust.
Engineering division, air bedding. Fall out.
What's he taking all that guff for?
''Yes, sir.'' ''No, sir.''
''Aye, aye, sir.''
Hey, Killer, do you really think he's bucking for a promotion?
Who, Mr. Roberts?
He's just tired, that's all.
Yeah, that's right. He's just tired.
Mr. Roberts, l got something here.
A little love letter from the Bureau came in just this morning.
Get a load of this.
''To all ships and stations:
''Heightened war offensive has created urgent need aboard combat ships...
''...for experienced officers.
''All commanding officers are directed to forward with their endorsement...
''...all applications for transfer from officers with 24 months sea duty.''
You've got 29 months.
Does that put old stupid behind the eight ball or don't it?
Here's your letter, all typed up and ready to go. Just the old John Hancock.
Go ahead, Mr. Roberts. l want to hear him explode.
Yeah, he'll go right through the overhead! l want to look it over first.
What's to look over? lt's just a standard form-- l'm not going to stand here and argue! l told you l want to look it over.
Get back to your typewriter before l put you on report!
All right, don't just stand here.
...from the headquarters of the Allied Command in Europe.
I repeat, there is no official announcement yet.
The report that the war in Europe has ended...
...has come from only one correspondent.
It has not been confirmed by other correspondents or by Allied Headquarters.
But here is one highly intriguing fact:
That report has not been denied.
Turn that thing off, will you, Doc?
Has Doug ever said anything to you about wanting a promotion?
Of course not. l doubt if he's even conscious of what rank he is.
He never thinks about a promotion.
All he ever thinks about is the war news.
Anybody who says he's bucking for another stripe is a dirty liar!
Who says he is? lnsigna, Mannion, some of those other guys. l heard them talking.
Outside the porthole, talking loud on purpose so l'd hear them.
Must've guessed l was lying here in my sack.
What's happened to Doug, anyway?
How would l know?
He's spoken about ten words to me in as many days. l'll find out though.
He won't talk, Doc. l followed him all around the room this morning while he was shaving. l begged him to talk to me. l said, ''You're a fella who needs a friend, and here l am.
''What's all this trouble between you and the crew?
''You tell me and l'll fix it up like that! ''
Then l gave him a lot of good advice.
Things like: ''Keep your chin up.''
You know what he did?
He walked right out of this room just as though l wasn't here.
And l was here.
Mr. Roberts is turning out to be like an officer, ain't he?
Doug boy, we thought you were up in the radio shack listening to the war news.
Don't you want to go out and get a cup of coffee?
-Yeah, sure. l'll go with you.
-No, l don't want to. You go ahead.
Will you get out anyway? l want to talk to Doc.
All right. l'm goin' for a cup of coffee.
No, l'm not. l'm going to the radio shack and listen to the war news.
You're not the only one interested.
See you later, Doc.
Transfer me, will you?
Transfer me to the hospital on this next island. You can do it.
You don't need the Captain's approval.
Just put me ashore for examination.
Say there's something wrong with my eyes or my feet or my head.
You can trump up something.
What good would that do?
Plenty. l'd lie around that hospital for a couple of weeks till the ship sailed. l'd be off this ship! Will you do it, Doc?
What's really the matter? l just put Dolan on report.
On report?
Why? l gave him an order. He didn't carry it out fast enough to suit me.
No, that's not true. lt's the war. l heard the news. The war was ending and l couldn't get to it.
There's Dolan, giving me guff about something, and all of a sudden l hated him! l hated all of them. lf they think l'm bucking for a promotion, that l walk ten feet across the room...
...to get anything from that captain...
...l'm through with the whole ungrateful mob!
Does this crew owe you something?
What do you mean by that?
You talk as if they did.
That's exactly how l'm talking.
Doc, that shows you how far gone l am. l'm blaming them for something that--
What? Something what?
Doug, you've made some sort of an agreement with the Captain, haven't you?
Agreement? l don't know what you mean.
Doc, turn on the radio!
This broadcast will bring you a special newsflash.
The war is over in Europe!
The war is over in Europe!
Germany has surrendered unconditionally to the Allied Armies.
The surrender was signed in a schoolhouse in the city of Reims. l would remind you that there is still a minor skirmish here in the Pacific. l'll miss that, too.
But this is the greatest day in the world.
We've got to celebrate.
-How about it, Frank?
-Yeah, we've gotta celebrate.
What'll it be? Alcohol and orange juice or orange juice and alcohol?
Doc, that's not good enough.
We've gotta think of something to lift this ship out of the water...
...and turn it around the other way.
You're gonna blow your lids when you hear this idea!
Oh, what a sweet idea!
You said l never finish anything l start.
Boy, you're wrong.
Tonight l started something and l'm gonna finish it.
-Wait a minute, what is it?
-A firecracker.
We're gonna heave a firecracker under that old man's bunk, and bam!
Wake up, you unpatriotic old slob! lt's V-E Day!
Did you ever see such a hand-painted, hand-packed firecracker in your life? lt's the most beautiful firecracker l've ever seen, but will it work?
Sure it will! Well, l think it will.
Haven't you tested it? lt's gotta work, it's just gotta. l'll take it to the laundry, my laboratory. l've got all the makings there. lf this one works, l can make another in two minutes.
We'll wait here. Be sure you've got enough to make it loud. What about powder?
Powder? This ain't no popgun. lt's a firecracker. l used fulminate of mercury!
Fulminate of mercury? That stuff's murder.
Do you suppose he means it?
Of course not! Where would he get fulminate of mercury? l don't know. He's pretty resourceful.
-Well, how about a little drink?
-Right.
Doc, l've been living with a genius.
This makes everything worthwhile, a whole year and a half he spent in his bunk.
How else could you celebrate VE Day?
A firecracker under the old man's bunk!
-To better days.
-Right.
And to a great American,
Frank Thurlowe Pulver...
...soldier, statesman, scientist.
Friend of the working girl.
What was that? l don't know what it was, Captain, but l'll try and find out.
Hey, there! Up on the bridge! ls there anything wrong up there?
Help! Help!
This may be pretty bad, Doug.
Geez, that stuff's terrific!
Are you all right?
Yeah, l'm great.
You should have been there!
You're not burned or anything?
No, but that laundry's kind of beat up.
You know those laundry machines...
...are clear on the other side of the room.
There's a new porthole on the starboard side. The electric eye went right through. l guess a steam line must have busted. l was up to here in lather!
Soapsuds were flying all around. lt was absolutely beautiful!
What was it? Has anybody found out? lt was the laundry, Captain.
A steam line must have busted.
Any damage?
We can't get in there.
The passageway is solid soapsuds.
Well, tell those men to be more careful.
Aye, aye, sir.
Frank, our celebration is just getting started.
The night is young and our duty is clear.
-What now?
-We're gonna get the rest of your stuff.
You proved that it worked.
You just hit the wrong target, that's all.
We're gonna make another firecracker and put it where it really belongs.
All of my stuff was down in the laundry. lt all went up. l'm sorry, Doug. l'm awful sorry.
That's okay, Frank.
-You're not sore at me, are you?
-What for?
-For spoiling the celebration.
-Of course not. lt was a good idea, wasn't it? lt was a great idea. l'm proud of you. lt just didn't work, that's all.
-Where are you going?
-Out on deck.
Wait, l'll clean up and come. l'm gonna turn in after that. lt's okay, Frank.
He was happy there for a minute.
Did you hear him laughing?
Did you find out what's the matter with him?
No, he wouldn't tell me.
But l know one thing he's feeling tonight and that's panic.
Tonight he feels his war is dying before he can get to it. l let him down.
He wanted to celebrate and l let him down.
We hope that the King and Queen will come out.
The crowds are cheering. Listen to them.
At any second now we hope to see Their Majesties.
The color here is tremendous.
Everywhere rosettes!
Everywhere gay red, white and blue hats!
What's all that jabberin' on the radio?
Something about the King and Queen.
A steam line busted in the laundry.
They're cleaning it up now. lt ain't even worth going to see.
Come on, Dolan, don't let them get you down.
What was them croquette things we had for chow tonight?
Good evening.
You fellas hear the news?
The war is over in Europe.
Yes, sir, we heard.
Sure, maybe somebody'll get on the ball out here now.
Dolan, l.... l guess l kind of blew my top. l'm sorry. l'm taking you off report.
Whatever you want, sir.
Well, l guess l'll hit the old sack.
Yeah, me too.
-Yeah, l think so.
-Good night. l didn't realize how late it was.
Since I talked to you 35 minutes ago...
...the picture's changed a little bit here in Times Square....
Our boys have won this victory today.
But the rest is up to you.
You, and you alone must recognize our enemies...
...the forces of ambition, cruelty, arrogance and stupidity!
You must recognize them.
You must destroy them!
You must tear them out as you would a malignant growth...
...and cast them from the surface of the Earth!
Sound the general alarm!
Sound the general alarm!
Sound the general alarm.
Off to the deck!
What happened?
What happened?
Must be an air raid!
Submarine! Must be a submarine!
What happened?
-Submarine!
-Must be an air raid!
Secure that life raft!
He didn't say abandon ship!
All right, now, wait a minute!
Laundry detail report to forward gun! l'm coming! Where's the gun?
-lnsigna?
-Yeah.
Are you supposed to be up there?
Yeah. We was up here last year.
Dowdy, where's my battle station? l don't know where your battle station is.
Look around!
Ask a man politely where his battle station is and he says, ''Look around! ''
Engine room manned and ready.
All battle stations manned and ready.
All except mine.
All battle stations manned and ready,
Captain.
All right. Who did it?
Who did it?
You are going to stand sweating at those battle stations until someone confesses!
It's an insult to the honor of this ship.
The symbol of our cargo record has been destroyed...
...and l'm going to find out who did it if it takes all night!
Symbol of our cargo record. What's that? l don't know.
Stefanowski, find some battle station.
-The palm tree's gone.
-Hey, come on, come on!
-The palm tree. The palm tree's gone.
-The palm tree's gone.
Read me that master list.
Abernathy.
No, not Abernathy.
-Baker.
-No.
-O'Neill.
-No, not O'Neill.
Pulver.
Pulver wouldn't have the guts.
Go on, go on.
Roberts.
Roberts! That's the one!
Get him up here. Get him up here, right now! Get him up here!
Mr. Roberts will report...
...to the Captain's cabin on the double.
Mr. Roberts will report to the Captain's cabin on the double.
Give me that!
Roberts! Roberts, you get up here in one quick hurry!
Roberts, get a move on.
I'm giving you an order!
Do you hear me, Roberts?
This is it. You get a move on and get up here, or this is finally...
...finally the showdown. We are going to have it out right here and now.
Do you hear, Roberts?
Get up here now!
You want to see me, Captain?
You did it! Don't stand there and lie to me.
Confess it!
Confess what? l don't know what you're talking about.
You know what l'm talking about because you did it!
You've double-crossed me!
You've gone back on your word!
No, I haven't, Captain.
Oh, yes, you have! Yes, you have.
I kept my part of the bargain.
I gave this crew liberty!
I gave this crew liberty...
...but you've gone back on your word.
You promised me on your word of honor!
I kept my word. I haven't written any more letters. l'm not talking about your stinking letters. l'm talking about what you did tonight!
Tonight? l don't understand you, Captain.
What do you think l did tonight?
You know what you did!
You stabbed me in the back!
You stabbed me in the--
Will the Doctor please report to the Captain's cabin on the double!
Will the doctor please report to the Captain's cabin on the double!
Hey, Lindstrom, where is the old man?
He's sittin' in a chair, leaning way forward.
What's the Doc doing?
Doc's holding a wastebasket.
What wastebasket?
The one the old man's got his head in.
There he goes again!
They got him to the couch.
That's it.
Now we mustn't let ourselves get angry, Captain.
We know that, don't we?
Look out, here they come.
We'll not need the stretcher now.
Sorry.
Chief?
Yes, sir.
Pass the word to the men to secure from general quarters.
See you later.
Now hear this! Now hear this!
Secure from general quarters.
Good night, Mr. Roberts.
Good night, Reber.
Okay, Mr. Roberts. l'll take these down to the gangway.
The boat from the island should be out here any minute for you. l'll let you know.
Never thought you'd be taking this trip, did you? l'll be off this bucket before l even wake up.
They're flying you all the way to the Livingston? l don't know. Dispatch said,
''Transfer, travel by air, if possible.''
They're landing planes at Okinawa now.
That's where my can's probably running around.
Okinawa?
You be mighty careful, Doug boy.
Doc, l even got a destroyer: the Livingston. l know a guy on the Livingston.
He don't think it's so hot.
Here your are, Mr. Roberts. l typed up three copies of the radio dispatch. l have to keep one copy and here's two for you.
You are now officially detached from this here bucket. Let me be the first.
How about these orders? l haven't sent in a letter for a month.
Listen, l can tell you exactly how that happened.
You see, those guys in Washington need men awful bad for combat duty.
They lookinged through some of the old letters...
...and come across one of yours.
Listen, we can't stand here beating our gums. The old man says:
''lf he ain't out of here in one hour, l'll throw him off! ''
-ls that all he said?
-That's all he said.
After fighting this thing for two years, you'd think he'd say more than that.
Guard, I don't want no man closer than ten feet! Understand?
What's that?
A new botanical garden.
Ain't you heard?
When we anchored this morning, he sent Olsen out with a special detail.
Dug up a new palm tree.
He's already set a 24-hour watch on that new baby, with orders to shoot to kill!
That reminds me, Ensign Pulver, the Captain wants to see you right away.
-What about?
-l don't know, sir. l'll come back to say good-bye later,
Mr. Roberts. Come on, Ensign Pulver. l bet those guys down in the laundry starched his pajamas again!
-You're pretty happy, aren't you?
-Yep.
You're happy about it, too, aren't you, Doc? l think it's the only thing for you.
What do you think of the crew now?
They're all right. They're nice guys.
How do you think they feel about you?
They like me well enough, till the next guy comes along.
You don't think you're necessary to them?
Doc, no officer is necessary to a crew.
Are you going to leave this ship believing that? lt's nothing against them, Doc.
They're too busy lookin' out for themselves to worry about anybody else.
Well, take a good, deep breath, Buster.
What do you think got you your orders?
Prayer and fasting?
Sending in enough box tops?
Dolan said one of my old letters turned up.
This crew got you transferred.
They were so busy thinking about themselves...
...that they took a chance of landing in prison for five years, every one of them.
You couldn't send in a letter for transfer, so they sent one in for you.
They knew the Captain wouldn't sign it approved...
...so they didn't bother him.
They signed it for him.
Doc, what do you mean?
They forged the Captain's name?
That's it exactly. lt was quite a thing to see, Doug...
...the Captain's name-signing contest.
Every man in the crew trying his best...
...to copy that little scrawl of the Captain's.
Then the judges decided the winner.
At the time, there was some criticism of their decision...
...on the grounds that the judges were drunk.
But apparently from the results, they chose pretty well.
How did you find out about it?
Well, it was a great honor. l'm the only officer aboard who knows. l was a contestant. l was also a judge.
This double honor was accorded me because of my character...
...charm, good looks...
...and because the medical department contributed...
...four gallons of grain alcohol to the contest.
Who won? Who signed it? l'm not at liberty to say.
Basically, they all did.
And with just one idea in mind:
To do something for Mr. Roberts. l wish you hadn't told me. lt makes me look pretty silly after what l just said.
But l didn't mean it, Doc. l was afraid to say what l really feel. l love those guys. l think they're the greatest guys on this Earth.
All of a sudden l feel there's something terribly wrong about leaving them.
What can l say to them?
Nothing. You don't know about it.
After you're safely aboard your new ship l'm supposed to write and tell you about it.
At the bottom of the letter l'm to say:
''Thanks for the liberty, Mr. Roberts.
''Thanks for everything.'' l'm the new cargo officer.
And that ain't all. l've gotta have dinner with him tonight.
He likes me!
Come in.
What's that?
Fire and rescue party!
We heard you had a fire in here.
No, but as long as you're here--
A false alarm, then? ln that case, we might as well drink this stuff.
What's in that?
A new batch of jungle juice? ln the handy new portable container.
Everybody loaded?
All right, you guys, you can come in now.
What is it?
Open it.
What is it, Doug? lt's a palm tree, see. lt was Dowdy's idea.
Mannion made it.
He cut it out of sheet brass.
Mannion drew the words on it, too.
Stefanowski thought up the words.
Booksie gets credit for the ribbon, from a box of candy he got from his mother.
Read the words, Mr. Roberts.
''Order of....''
''Order of the Palm.
''To Lieutenant J.G. Douglas Roberts.
''For action against the enemy, above and beyond the call of duty.'' lt's very nice, but l think you've got the wrong guy.
We know, sir.
But we'd like you to have it anyway.
Okay, l'll keep it.
Stefanowski thought up the words.
They're fine words.
The boat's here, Mr. Roberts. l put your gear in.
They want to shove off right away.
-We haven't had our drink yet.
-No, sir.
You won't get any jungle juice aboard that destroyer, Mr. Roberts.
That's right, Dowdy.
Good-bye, Doc. And thanks.
Good-bye, Frank.
Remember, l'm counting on you!
Mail call will be on the forward hatch immediately.
Newspapers. Eight weeks old.
Ensign Pulver, we just heard.
No movies again tonight!
Why not?
He said we was making too much noise.
We wasn't making too much noise.
Talk to him, will you, Ensign Pulver?
What me? To the Captain? Yeah.
-Bookser?
-Yes, sir.
-Lindstrom?
-Yes, sir.
-Dolan?
-Here, sir.
-Stefanowski?
-Right here, sir.
My mother, all she ever says is,
''Stay away from Japan.''
What's your news, Doc?
My wife got some new wallpaper for the living room.
Pretty.
Alabama. l shall read that one later.
-Hey, Doc. This is from Doug.
-Yeah?
What does he say?
Hey, you guys. You want to hear a letter from Mr. Roberts?
''Dear Frank....
''This will be short and sweet...
''...as we're shoving off in about two minutes.''
This was dated three weeks ago.
Does he say where he is?
Yeah, he says, ''My guess about the location of this ship is exactly right.''
That means he's around Okinawa.
He met Fornell.
That friend of mine, guy named Fornell l went to college with?
This is what he says:
''Fornell says that you and he used to load up your car with liquor in Omaha...
''...and sell it at an indecent profit to the fraternity boys at lowa city.''
''How about that?''
We did, too!
''This part is for Doc. l've been....''
Go ahead and read it. lt's for both of us.
''Doc, l've been aboard this destroyer for two weeks now...
''...and we've already been through four air attacks.
''l'm in the war at last, Doc!
''l've caught up with that task force that passed me by.
''l'm glad to be here. l had to be here, l guess.
''But l'm thinking now of you, Doc, and you, Frank.
''And Dolan, and Dowdy, and lnsigna and everyone else on that bucket.
''All the guys everywhere who sail from Tedium to Apathy...
''...and back again, with an occasional side trip to Monotony.
''This is a tough crew on here, and they have a wonderful battle record.
''But l've discovered, Doc, that the unseen enemy of this war...
''...is the boredom that eventually becomes a faith...
''...and, therefore, a terrible sort of suicide.
''l know now that the ones who refuse to surrender to it...
''...are the strongest of all.
''Right now l'm looking at something that's hanging over my desk.
''A preposterous hunk of brass...
''...attached to the most bilious piece of ribbon l've ever seen.
''l'd rather have it than the Congressional Medal of Honor.
''lt tells me what l'll always be proudest of:
''That at a time in the world when courage counted most...
''...l lived among 62 brave men.
''So, Doc, and especially you, Frank, don't let those guys down.
''Of course l know that by this time they must be very happy...
''...because the Captain's overhead is filled with marbles.
''And here comes the mail orderly.
This has to go now. l'll finish it later.
''Meanwhile you guys can write too, can't you? Doug.''
May l see that, Frank?
This one's from Fornell.
''l'd rather have it than the Congressional Medal of Honor.''
Well, l'm glad he found that out.
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
Frank, what is it?
Mr. Roberts is dead.
This is from Fornell.
They took a Jap suicide plane and killed everybody in a twin 40 battery...
...and went right on through and killed Doug...
...and some other officer, in the wardroom.
They were drinking coffee when it hit.
Coffee?
Could l have that? l'd like to post it for the crew.
Post this instead. lt's theirs.
Yes, who is it? lt is l, Ensign Pulver, and l just threw your stinkin' palm tree overboard.
Now what's all this crud about no movie tonight?
This is it, Rupert. Our big chance.
Maybe next week, your name will go up in lights.
Rupert, the talk of the town.
You won't let me down, will you, Rupert?
You'll do everything just like I taught you?
Now, how about a dress rehearsal? Here.
The curtain is up. You're on the stage.
Stay right there when I tell you.
Now get ready for our song and dance.
Are you all set?
One, two...
Now we've got to do the dance in unison.
And it's got to be perfect, for everything depends on how we do it.
You all set? Here we go.
- Phil, I'm so glad to see you.
- Joe, how have you been?
Not too good, but everything's gonna change now.
Sit down. How are you, miss?
This is Joe Mahoney.
He used to work out of my father's office.
And the best lion-tamer in the business.
Weren't you?
- Go on with you.
- Delighted, I'm sure.
Thank you.
What's this new act that you wired me about?
Here it is. Now greet the man, Rupert.
You mean, that's it?
That's it.
- A squirrel?
- Sure.
- You wouldn't fool me, would you?
- He's a great performer.
Something like Rupert only happens once in a million years.
I'm sorry, Joe, but I'm not interested.
- He's not box office.
- Come on, honey, we're late.
- Phil, you haven't seen what he can do.
- I've seen enough already.
Joe, look... a lion is a big, savage beast.
He's vicious, ruthless.
A bloodthirsty killer from the faraway jungles of darkest Africa.
So he's box office.
But a little pipsqueak thing like a squirrel...
that anybody can see anyplace, in any park, anytime...
Besides, he's so small, they'd never see him in the balcony.
But I tell you, Rupert's almost human.
- Come on, honey, we're late.
- Just a minute.
Look, Joe...
I'd love to give you a break.
I know things have been tough.
- But he just ain't...
- Box office.
Goodbye, Mr. Dingle.
I'll pay you every cent that I owe you.
You should, Mahoney.
Pete. Get a broom and pail, and help me clean this place out.
It's nice and peaceful here, ain't it?
You can breathe.
Take a good look around at some of your new pals.
I want you to go on and get acquainted with them. Come on.
That's it.
Don't be stubborn about this. Go on.
To be sure, it's a silly outfit.
There you are.
They would have laughed at you.
Now, go on. Yes, I know you don't want to.
L know you'll be happy here.
I know they'll love you.
You'll be the life of the party... doing the somersaults and all the cute little tricks that I taught you.
Go on, I tell you.
Beat it, I tell you.
Beat it, I tell you.
What shall I do?
You just ain't box office.
Papa, do you think we might have some money in that Chicago account?
I heard from that bank last week.
I think I got the letter with me.
Here it is.
It says, "Dear Mr. Amendola, this is the last monthly statement we will mail you.
"We feel it is hardly worth three cents to tell you you have two cents."
Let's get going.
Look at all those lucky people, hurrying home with arms full of packages.
They'll have turkey for Christmas, packages under the tree.
Don't envy them, Rosalinda.
I bet every one of them faced a Christmas like us at some time or another.
Besides, it ain't Christmas yet.
Saint Nick may have a bundle for us, too.
But the trouble is, we ain't got no address he can deliver them to.
Amendola! The Amendola Trio!
- Joe Mahoney!
- Joe, darling!
Now, don't tell me this is little Rosie.
She's certainly growing fast. A little too fast.
It seems like only yesterday
I bought her them shoes... and already she's complaining they're too small.
And with you? How's the act been going?
Us? Great. Sensational.
If I made any more money,
I'd have to buy myself a wallet.
And you know something?
We've played the circuit so many times, just for a change... we booked a European tour.
- Europe?
- London, Paris, Budapest.
And in India, we gave a performance the audience will never forget.
- Why?
- Because they were elephants.
Please, a little respect for that joke.
It's older than you.
Sorry, Joe.
I see you haven't been doing so good.
- To tell you the truth, it has been a little...
- You don't have to tell me.
It's the same with us. We haven't worked since Rosie cut her second teeth.
- Joe, do you live around here?
- I do. I did.
L just moved out less than a half-hour ago.
- Ls the place rented yet?
- I don't think so.
- How much rent did you pay?
- I didn't.
But if you've got $32, you can move right in.
How long did you live there without paying any rent?
Six months.
Just what we're looking for.
Something out of the high-rent district.
- It's been good seeing you.
- You must drop in and see us soon.
Yes, thank you.
Wait for me!
- Hadn't you better ask him where it is?
- We ain't got no time.
Joe!
- Where is it?
- 322-and-a-half Maple Street. Over there.
Come on back. It's this way.
Wait for me!
Merry Christmas.
Come here. Here, boy.
Hello.
Pardon this unseemly protrusion... but after reading this sign,
I took the liberty of removing it.
- I don't think you'll need it anymore.
- You wanna rent this place?
We might work something out, if you don't drag lawyers into this.
You'd better speak to my father about it. He's right next door.
On second thought, I can handle this myself.
Come in.
Be back in a minute.
Gosh, it's good to be home.
- My name is Amendola.
- My name is Pete Dingle.
Rosalinda.
Joe Mahoney sent us.
That's okay with me, but don't mention it to my father.
The rent will be $32 a month.
I don't mind electric bulbs that are unfrosted.
I don't mind beds with springs that fight back... or window shades that curl up like anchovies.
But there's one thing I can't stand.
Leaky faucets.
- Do you mind?
- Not at all.
Perfect.
Mama, you might as well start unpacking.
This ain't exactly the bridal suite at the Waldorf.
But who knows?
If we give this place a good cleaning...
- we might find an extra room.
- "Good cleaning" is right.
Look at all those cobwebs.
Don't touch those cobwebs. They're probably holding the building together.
Now that all the business has been taken care of...
But you see, my father, unfortunately, wants his money in advance.
And a lucky man he is, too, your father, having a son so gifted in the art of music.
I just fool around...
I know. I, too, am a musician.
Modesty compels me to admit that I play a pretty piano... and if necessary,
I can even play an ugly one.
Don't forget. Feel free to drop in at any time.
Thanks very much.
About the rent...
- I think I'm gonna like it here.
- I hope so.
Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to change.
No, not at all. I mean...
I'll see you later.
- Well, Mama, I did it.
- Look, Pa, he forgot his tuba.
He'll be back. But if he don't, you can blow on it every night and announce dinner.
You realize what I've done?
No rent in advance, and a roof over our heads.
There's an awful big hole in the skylight.
So what? If it snows, we'll be the only ones in town to have a white Christmas... inside the house and out.
- Hello, Pete.
- Hi.
I think I got a letter for you.
- No, it's for your old man.
- I'll give it to him.
If I don't see you tomorrow, merry Christmas.
Same to you.
- Did you clean the place?
- Clean it? I rented it.
Good, you can work if you make up your mind.
- Who'd you rent it to?
- Their name is Amendola.
Their?
- How many are there?
- Just three.
They're awfully nice people.
That's good for a change. I'll take the money.
There's a mother and a father...
- and a daughter.
- Okay, give me the $32.
They didn't even ask for any redecorations or repairing anything.
That saves us a lot of money, Pa.
Don't tell me you let them stay without paying.
You're gonna get it.
They're awfully nice people.
A mother, and a father and a daughter.
You said that before.
Look, son, I want that $32 right now.
If you don't get it, I'll go and get it myself.
And if I don't get it, out they go!
But I gave my word of honor we'd wait a couple of days.
You don't wanna break your own son's word, do you? honor, charity, love thy neighbor. Everything but money.
Tell me, son, what did money ever do to you that you hate it so much?
I'll get it.
Oh, hello.
Hello. You forgot to give me the key.
The key? Yes, the key.
- Here it is.
- Thank you.
Wait a minute.
- You'll stay, won't you?
- If my father...
Who is it, Pete?
Don't go away. I'll be right back.
- Who was it?
- The postman. It's for you.
National Security Bank.
What do those chiselers want?
What is it?
Just an advertisement.
Katie, come here.
What is it?
That worthless gold mine
I invested in 10 years ago is paying off.
Here's a check for $1,500.
And they say we're gonna get the same amount each week from now on.
Mercy! It's the day before Christmas, too.
It's money from heaven.
- We should go to church and pray.
- Sure.
But first I'll go down to the bank and cash the check.
I know that apartment isn't what you folks have been used to.
- But with a little paint and fixing it up...
- You mean, you'll redecorate it?
I'll speak to my father about it.
Mother's been having a little trouble with the stove. It's awfully old.
We'll see what we can do about that, too.
- Maybe get you another one.
- A new stove!
- Is there somebody asleep in there?
- My father.
My father's a little reluctant about investing money.
He has to be handled with kid gloves.
- Say, how about going for a walk?
- Not in these shoes, I wouldn't.
- They pinch my feet.
- Go get some others. I'll wait for you.
It'll be a long wait. I haven't any others.
What size do you wear?
Dreaming of a size 4. Why?
Stay right where you are.
Not a word of this to a soul, Katie.
Not anybody, especially that lazy son of yours.
If he finds out, he'll blow that blasted tuba the rest of his life.
- Mom, what size shoe do you wear?
- 6, why?
Never mind.
Don't you buy shoes for me for Christmas.
I've got two pairs already.
Isn't that nice? Not a nickel in his pocket, and he wants to buy me shoes.
Just for that, Frank,
I want you to buy a nice necktie for him... and put it under the Christmas tree.
He likes those hand-painted ones.
I saw some perfectly lovely ones for only $5.
$5, eh?
I'll get some paint out of the attic and paint one myself.
They called us the Amendola Trio, the Human Pyramid.
Papa balanced Mama on his shoulders... and then I stood on top of Mama, all done up like a little angel.
Sounds exciting.
Papa juggled, Mama sang, and I played the harp.
Used to go over big.
Only I started growing, Mama got heavier... and one day, Papa's legs gave out.
You mean he dropped you?
Four times in one week.
The fourth time, Mama broke her leg.
You gotta hand it to Papa, though.
He never broke a plate. He's a great juggler.
Look, there's my father, coming out of the bank.
- Wonder what he was doing in the bank.
- I've never been in a bank.
Just to think of all that money in one place.
A week ago, this tree was $7.
Yesterday, $4. Now, what are my bids?
- 40 cents.
- Make it $1.
One dollar.
I wish we were gonna have a tree.
Of course, with the moving and all...
We've talked enough about me.
Tell me, where do you work?
I don't. That is, I write music.
- Does it pay?
- No.
Then you don't work.
- I don't have a job.
- Can't you find one?
- I've never looked for one.
- What about money?
I don't need money.
Suppose you were walking with a girl, and she wanted a malted milk.
What would you do?
Well, that would be pretty embarrassing.
I'm sorry I said that, Pete.
Come on, let's go home.
Folks, just two more left.
What am I bid for this one?
- 40 cents.
$1.50. Do I hear $2?
$1.50, once, twice.
Sold to this gentleman for $1.50!
Now for the last tree. It's your last chance.
What're my bids for this one?
- 40 cents.
- 75 cents.
Do I hear $1? Will someone make it $1?
- 75 cents, once, twice...
$1, I've got. Once, twice, sold to this gentleman for $1.
Here you are, buddy.
Say, mister, would it be all right if I pay you 40 cents now... and the balance later?
Sure! Just take the elevator to the 18th floor.
That's our credit department.
This is a cash sale, buddy.
Do you want the tree or don't you?
Hey, wait!
Look, you can have the tree.
Give me the 40 cents.
Thanks!
I'll pay you the rest as soon as I can.
I'll give you a week.
If you don't pay by then...
I'll find out where you live and take the tree back.
- Why didn't you leave it at the bank?
- At the bank?
Katie, you're not serious.
After all that happened to our little savings in 1929?
No, sirree, they're never gonna get any of my money again.
I'm going to hide it right in this house.
You better run over to the church and say that little prayer now.
You're sending me away... because you want to keep the hiding place a secret from me.
No, it isn't you, Katie. It's Pete.
You're too soft-hearted with that boy.
- I'm afraid that...
- What's the use of money if you hide it?
Money's for buying things... to enjoy life, to have some pleasure.
That's a lot of hooey. Money's for security... not to worry about the future, to enjoy sleep.
All right, Frank, I'm going.
I don't care if you stick that money up the chimney... and let it smoke till it smells like a ham butt.
How long is it going to be?
Moving from one place to another.
Always moving... never having a place to call our home.
Believe me, Lord, we've tried so hard.
We've tried everything. Everything.
But it's so difficult to find a job for a human pyramid.
You're our only hope.
So it's up to you.
Please.
Tomorrow is Christmas.
We haven't even got a tree.
No money to buy some little gifts.
Not even a pair of shoes for Rosalinda.
She must have those shoes, Lord.
She needs them real bad.
Thank you!
Tell me, Rosalinda...
- do you still play the harp?
- Sure, why?
I think I'll compose something just for the harp and tuba.
And I'm gonna call it
The Melody Of Two Orphaned Instruments.
That's a cute title.
- You think they'll go together?
- I don't know.
But I'm hoping.
Papa! Wait!
But I don't understand.
A tree! Presents!
And look at it, Papa, a turkey!
And cranberry sauce, plum pudding, candy, and nuts.
And, look, brand-new shoes.
But how? I don't understand.
You couldn't have won it on a quiz program.
- We haven't got any phone.
- No, Papa, I didn't win anything.
Mama! Your wedding ring!
You didn't hock your...
- No, I didn't hock anything. All I did...
- I know.
You wired that drummer in Boston who had a crush on you.
That sheik with the patent leather shoes and tuxedo.
I remember what he said when we announced our engagement.
"If ever you needed anything- ♪
Papa, that was 22 years ago.
I don't care if it was 100 years ago!
I never trusted a guy with a tuxedo... especially a rented one.
Let Mama explain, Papa.
No, the money didn't come from him.
It came from...
Here, Papa, you'd better sit down.
- Better loosen your collar, Papa.
- Rosalinda, bring Papa a glass of water.
Papa, you love me, don't you?
- Of course I love you.
- And you trust me?
You'd believe me if I told you something, wouldn't you?
Even if nobody else in the world would believe me... you would believe me, wouldn't you, Papa?
Sure, I would, Mama.
I was sitting right here in this chair... and I was praying.
This money...
Come floating right down through the hole in the skylight.
- From heaven?
- You do believe me, don't you, Papa?
If you said it, I gotta believe you.
Merry Christmas, Papa.
Merry Christmas, Papa.
You see, Rosie?
I told you old Saint Nick wouldn't forget us.
All we needed was an address.
Frank, this perfume is lovely. "Dangerous."
Such a big bottle.
It must have cost at least $10.
It's not that dangerous.
This is a terrific tie, Dad.
Thanks again.
Did you see the watermelons, Mama?
They're hand-painted.
Now, who's that?
Merry Christmas, young man.
May we come in?
Why, of course.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas to you.
Why, Mr. Amendola, we have the exact same ties on.
It could be a lot worse if we were girls wearing the same dresses.
Mom, Dad, this is Mr. and Mrs. Amendola...
- and their daughter, Rosalinda.
- How do you do?
We're your new tenants, and the Yuletide season being upon us... we thought we'd drop in and pay you a visit.
- To pay what?
- A visit, Frank.
Make yourselves comfortable.
- Do sit down.
- Thanks.
- I'm glad you brought your harp.
- Can we put it right over here?
That's a nice tree you got there, Mr. Dingle.
Where did you get it? Molineri's?
Maybe we ought to go down there next week and make our payments together.
Payments? Speaking of payments... just what do you do for a living?
Doesn't the name of Amendola suggest nothing to you?
You surely must have seen us perform someplace.
Florida in the racing season,
Lake Placid in the winter season... or perhaps Africa in the malaria season.
Yes, sir, someday you'll be able to say the Amendolas were your tenants.
If I don't get my rent money,
I'll be able to say that tomorrow.
I'm glad you brought that up, Mr. Dingle.
Now, if you'll just hang your sock on the mantle...
I'll drop in three months' rent.
Keep the $4 change.
Three months' rent in advance.
Mr. Amendola, we're so glad you folks dropped in on us.
Katie, get Mr. Amendola a chair... and some coffee and cake.
Where's the Christmas spirit?
That's right, where is the Christmas spirit?
I love the excitement of Christmas.
I'll never forget one Christmas Eve when I was a kid.
I hung my stocking up on the mantle and went to bed.
When I woke up the next morning, what do you think I found in the stocking?
My father's foot!
Soft.
Soft.
Wait a minute!
Another outburst like that, Mr. Dingle... and I'll hide your electric trains.
Soft.
Soft!
How do you like that?
There's a guy going in business for himself.
Wait a minute. All together!
This is wonderful.
Mr. Dingle, this is gonna develop into a long and beautiful friendship... even closer than Damon and Phythenias.
You'll notice Rosalinda brought her harp along.
She didn't bring it to slice hard-boiled eggs.
All right, Rosalinda.
- Here you are, Rosalinda.
- Thank you.
I finished The Melody for Two Orphaned Instruments.
- Wanna try it?
- Sure. Set the music right over here, Pete.
- Here you are.
- Thanks.
- Ready?
- Yes.
I don't want my wife to hear this.
The stage has always fascinated me.
Don't you think
I've got a very fine singing voice?
Why, the bathtubs of the world are full of singers, Mr. Dingle.
But did you ever hear of anyone doing a backflip in the bathtub? No.
And you know the reason why?
Because only a few of us are acrobats.
Acrobats. I'd just love to learn a few tricks.
I'm always so dull when company comes.
I can't do a thing.
Can you teach me a few things?
I'd be glad to teach you.
You got anything around here that we could rig up like a teeterboard?
- A seesaw?
- Yeah.
I think so. Let me see, now.
- How about a table leaf?
- You got one? Go get it.
Great, now get me a glass of water.
Thanks.
This is so simple, I taught it to Rosalinda when she was only 3 years old.
Now you get up on that chair.
I'll stand down at this end, place the glass of water on my head... and when I say go, you jump down on that end.
I will then do a back somersault, light a cigarette in midair... and land in that chair without spilling one drop of water.
- Ready?
- Ready.
Go.
Termites.
That's so pretty, Pete.
And he wrote it himself.
How well he plays the tuba!
- It's lovely, Pete.
- So are you.
Gosh, Rosalinda, your hair, your dress...
- Gosh, you're beautiful.
- Thank you, Pete.
- May I have this, Pete?
- Sure.
I wrote it for you.
Look, somebody's coming to see us, in a beautiful car.
Rosalinda, go down and see who it is.
It might be somebody important.
- Yes?
- Hello. Ls Joe Mahoney home?
- He's moved away.
- He has?
- You know where he went?
- I'm afraid I don't.
That's great. What do I do with this Christmas present I brought him?
Here, it's yours.
- Go ahead.
- I really don't...
It's just fruit and things.
- You live here?
- Yes.
- Alone?
- With my parents.
That's nice.
- Anything I can do for you?
- My name is Phil Davis.
- I'm a friend of Joe Mahoney's...
- Phil Davis, the agent?
- Yes, that's me.
- Believe me, this is a pleasure.
My name is Amendola. You've heard of the Amendola Trio, haven't you?
You know, the Human Pyramid? Come in.
Now, don't pay any attention to this apartment, Mr. Davis.
We just moved in yesterday.
Not much of a place... but for certain reasons it fascinates me.
Mr. Davis, take a look at this poster.
You're gazing at one of the greatest vaudeville acts of its time.
And the only reason we disbanded... was because of my little daughter's rapid maturity.
- Yes, I can see what you mean.
- Mr. Davis, I was just thinking...
I can work alone. Why, I can out-juggle anyone in the business.
You know something?
I can juggle 25 plates with one hand.
And with the other hand,
I pick up the broken ones.
Just a little joke I use in the act.
Now if you give me your undivided attention...
Say, that's good. That's great.
How did you do it?
How did you do it?
What? That's a trade secret.
- Do it again.
- Yes, do it again, Papa.
Rosalinda, you know the great Amendola never repeats twice.
That's very clever.
I'll try and book you, Mr. Amendola.
Sure.
- How about you?
- About me?
I'm sorry to butt in, but the coffee's ready.
A girl with your looks and figure should be in the limelight.
And I'm just the man that can put you there.
Said he as he twirled his black mustache and eyed the proud beauty.
- Who's he?
- Please.
You were saying, Mr. Davis?
A girl like you should have a decent place to live.
Not a dump like this.
What's good enough for my parents...
Is hardly good enough for a raving beauty like you.
- And Mr. Davis here is just...
- Please.
The coffee's ready.
It's getting cold, and so is the cake.
I'm sorry, but Mr. Davis is a very important Broadway agent.
- Broadway chiseler.
- I beg your pardon. What was that?
I know the type.
Promises young girls expensive clothes, diamonds, furs.
- Anything to make an impression.
- He didn't say that. You did.
He was going to.
What right has he got to call me a chiseler?
He doesn't even know me.
I think he's jealous.
Maybe he's got a case.
Say, it's Christmas, and I'm all alone.
How about me taking you out to a Chinese dinner tonight?
I'm sorry, but I was...
I'd love to.
Father, may I go out with Mr. Davis?
- You better ask your mother.
- Thanks a lot.
I threw five nuts up, and only four came down.
This defies the laws of gravity.
It's midnight. She isn't home yet.
Mama, stop worrying.
Nothing can happen to her.
She's not alone. She's with a man.
Another miracle happened this afternoon.
- A miracle?
- I tried to juggle a few walnuts.
- One didn't come down. It just disappeared.
- Mercy me.
This is a strange house.
Money comes down and walnuts go up.
But I guess that's better than money going up and walnuts coming down.
I don't know what to make of it.
Katie, Katie!
What is it, Frank?
I've been thinking about that Amendola family.
Why should people who can afford three months' rent in advance... wanna live in a dump like that?
Frank, last night you couldn't sleep because they didn't pay their rent.
Tonight you can't sleep because they did.
For goodness' sake, stop worrying and go to sleep.
Why don't you check out of this town?
Come to New York.
- Things can happen to you there, Rosie.
- Let's not start that again, Phil.
I'm crazy about you, Rosie.
I'll do anything for you.
Do you know any music publishers, Phil?
Sure, dozens of them. Why?
I wrote some music. I think it's beautiful.
If you could take it...
I didn't know you were a composer.
"Melody for Two Orphaned Instruments by Peter Dingle."
Who's Peter Dingle?
You see, I put a man's name on it... because I knew no one would even look at it if they knew a girl wrote it.
I'll see what I can do. If it's any good,
I'll try and get it published.
- Thanks a lot, Phil. Good night.
- Wait a minute.
See you tomorrow.
- I'm sorry to wake you up, Mr. Haggerty.
- What's the matter, Pete? Somebody sick?
Yeah, me. I want that job.
Do you want to start right now, or can you wait till tomorrow morning?
I'm sorry, I was afraid somebody else might get it.
You see, Mr. Haggerty, I need money.
Hey, Pete.
Yeah?
Bend closer, laddie boy.
This is for your ears alone.
I got a sure thing in the sixth at California today.
Cut me in on 40 percent, and I'll give it to you.
This one can't lose. It'll win in a walk.
And while our horse is walking, the others will be running.
If you have another hot tip, Mulligan, leave it under the plate.
- Yes, sir?
- What's your best cigar?
- Good ones are a quarter apiece.
- Quarter apiece?
How much does a whole one cost?
- It's just a little joke.
- As little as I've heard.
Pete.
- Hello.
- Hi.
What will it be?
- I didn't know you worked here, Pete.
- That's strange. It was in the papers.
But remember, once you told me you were opposed to work.
Sure.
I even remember I couldn't buy a certain girl a cool drink in a drugstore.
Now, not only can I buy it, but serve it, too.
What will it be?
You took this job on account of me.
The girl I'm referring to only wanted a malted milk.
Can we go now?
- It's you. Let's go, honey.
- I'd like a malted milk, Phil.
- Not in this dump, please.
- Goodbye.
So long.
Pete, you're missing a great bid.
That filly's sure to wind up in the money.
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.
How's that for a bargain? Only $49.50.
But, Papa, what do we want with a polar bear rug?
This isn't an ordinary polar bear. Just watch.
All you got to do is twist the tooth and...
Music! It's also a radio.
The other tooth is for shortwave.
- But we don't need it.
- Sure we do.
It lends an air of quality to the place.
Mama, what's a real home without a polar bear?
But we must stop buying things.
That $500 you have left has got to last.
I'm glad you brought that up.
You know that Mr. Byfield, who we bought these few pieces of furniture off?
I stopped by there today to look at that little piano we were talking about.
And you know something?
- He isn't doing so well.
- Papa, I hope you didn't...
It's not his fault that business is bad.
Naturally, with the banks leaning on the place...
- and no one to...
- Our last $500.
Papa, all our lives, you've been doing this.
Whenever we get a little ahead, you meet someone who's in trouble... and you just melt like chocolate in a baby's hand.
I couldn't help it. He needed it.
But, Mama, we got nothing to worry about.
We still got that $100 I gave you yesterday.
No, I mailed that money away for the unpaid bills we left in Chicago.
That puts us right back where we were a week ago.
That's right. All you gotta do is do what you did a week ago.
Pray.
Lam praying every hour of the day.
But if it's more money you want me to pray for...
Why not, Mother? It's worth a try.
L just wouldn't have the nerve to ask again.
Besides, it's selfish.
But Papa just told us he helped somebody with it.
That wasn't selfish.
And besides, all you gotta do is ask, and let heaven make up its own mind.
- Even if I could remember the prayer...
- You must remember, Mother.
- The same thing you said before.
- I don't know.
All I recall saying is that Rosalinda needs shoes.
But now she doesn't need shoes.
She has four pairs already.
But, Mama, when you say she needs shoes... that doesn't mean she really needs them.
It's like stagehands in the theater playing dice. A guy says:
"Baby needs a new pair of shoes."
That doesn't mean she needs them.
It's just a disfigurement of speech.
- All right, bring me the little old rocker.
- I'll get it.
I was sitting in it when it happened.
Say it, Mama.
Please, help us. Rosalinda needs shoes.
She needs them real bad.
It's no use, Mama.
The prayer won't be answered.
Maybe it has been answered, and the answer is no.
We're grateful, anyhow.
I guess I'd better take this rug back to the shop.
Please forgive me for telling a lie.
Rosalinda doesn't need shoes.
Come back! It's coming down!
It happened exactly a week ago at about the same time.
- Exactly $1,500 again.
- Bless me!
All you gotta do is sit in that old rocker every Thursday at 3:30 and say:
"Rosalinda needs shoes," and collect $1,500.
It's funny how simple life can be.
It's coming down.
- Hello, Petrushka.
- Here's your pies and cake, Mr. Amendola.
- Thanks.
- And here's a check.
Your share of our profits for this month.
You cast your dough upon the waters, it circulates... and it comes back strawberry shortcake.
- Thanks, partner.
- Thank you, Mr. Amendola.
- Who was it, Papa?
- Petrushka, our baker.
Oh, mama.
Look.
This is our share of the month's profit.
How much did we decide to contribute to buy shoes for European children?
$600.Why?
Deposit this, and we can make it $1,000.
That's fine.
It's all over town. This Amendola character gave $1,025 for kids' shoes.
He lives in a stable and sleeps on straw.
He doesn't work. It don't add up.
Where does he get the money?
He gave $2,500 for European children.
- What line of business is he in?
- Nobody knows.
Read all about it!
Local man gives thousands to charity!
Read all about it!
When they moved in, they didn't have a nickel to their name.
Two months later, he buys a shipload of shoes for foreign kids.
Now, how do you figure that?
I'd like a Super-Duper
Triple-Decker Banana Delight.
Coming UP-
You know what I think?
He's printing his own money, right there in that shack of yours, Mr. Dingle.
I hate gossip.
But I just heard from a friend of mine... whose wife told him, and she swears it's true... that Amendola is a big gangster in hiding.
And if I was you, Mr. Dingle,
I'd notify the police right away.
Notify the FBI. I saw it in a movie.
Someone should write them an anonymous letter.
Sure, write anonymous letters.
Report him to the police. Put him in jail.
The guy has to be punished because he has a big heart.
Pipe down, Pete. I told you never to argue with the customers.
Sorry.
I think it's all a lot of hooey.
You know what I heard?
A man comes to see the pretty
Amendola girl every day in a big car.
- We can't hear you.
- Louder.
A man comes to see their daughter every day in a big car.
True. He's a Broadway agent.
What about him?
- Like a little strawberry?
- Sure.
He's the individual that floods Amendola with money, on account of that girl.
- Some whipped cream?
- Love that.
That's what I say about actors.
People like the Amendolas can contaminate a whole community.
Just like one rotten apple in a barrel.
Pete!
Oh, my goodness!
I forgot the cherry.
- What will it be?
- Bourbon and water.
- Hi, Pete.
- Hi.
Say, I had dinner at the drugstore... and I heard you pushed a chocolate sundae into a perfectly good customer's kisser.
- Is it true?
- No, it was a Banana Delight.
You're hurt, Pete.
Who hurt you, boy?
Nobody. I just counted my money... and I discovered
I was 16 cents short of my first million.
That makes me sad.
Listen, Pete, if you're open to a proposition...
I know how to make some real dough.
Get this. A friend of mine...
Look, Eddie, why don't you make like a ballerina and dance away?
Here, stick this in the jukebox and play something loud.
This friend of mine is drilling for oil in California.
He's down 9,000 feet. Got 500 more to go.
So now it's oil stocks.
Don't you ever give up, Mulligan?
But, Pete, for only $2,000, you can grab yourself 20 percent interest... and become a millionaire in no time.
Are you out of your mind?
Where would I get $2,000?
How about asking your old man?
Don't be ridiculous.
My father gets a small pension.
- He's happy if he can make ends meet.
- That's what you think, Junior.
My brother-in-law, who happens to be a policeman at the bank... says that old man of yours has been cashing pretty large checks for weeks now.
Wait a minute.
I did see him coming out of the bank once.
- He gets a letter from them every week.
- You see?
All you have to do is ask him to back you.
What father could refuse such a proposition?
Tell me, Mulligan, is this really on the level?
Tell you what I'll do.
I'll introduce you to my friend.
He'll show you the papers.
And besides, he'll give you all the security you want.
I'll see you tomorrow.
There must be a screw loose in your head.
Who's got $2,000? What $2,000?
I know you have it. You've been seen in the bank cashing large checks.
That's a lie. Now get out.
I don't want to hear any more.
I'll pay you back. I'll repay you 10 times over.
But I haven't got it, I tell you!
Pa, you must give it to me. You simply must.
Get out, you crazy fool. Get out before
I break that blasted tuba over your head.
Get out!
- Goodbye.
- I'll walk you there.
No, that's all right.
- Sure you can get in all right?
- Sure.
Good night.
Oh, Pete.
Hello, Rosalinda.
It's a beautiful night, isn't it?
- Mind if I join you?
- No.
Not at all.
I wanna talk to you.
What is it, Pete?
That is, I have no right to say this, but...
Say it anyhow, Pete.
It might be something I'd like to hear.
It's the money your father's spending.
They think it's coming from Davis.
- From Phil?
- Yeah.
They say he's in love with you.
You don't believe that, do you, Pete?
I can see how anyone might get a wrong impression... about Phil and me, I mean.
But there isn't anything between us, Pete.
I can't explain about the money, because there isn't any explanation, but...
There's no need for one... not about Davis, or the money... or anything.
Then, what is it, Pete?
Why are we sitting here like this, when all you have to say is...
What's the use, Rosalinda?
All right, suppose I am in love with you.
That's not enough.
$2,000, plus more luck than I dare hope for... and we might be able to do something about it.
A marriage license only costs $2.
Yeah, but how could we live?
- We could manage.
- How?
By putting windows in my tuba and converting it into a Quonset hut?
My mother and father didn't have a penny when they were married.
And Papa says that was the happiest time in their whole lives.
Very true.
That's great. But I can't even juggle.
We'll have to take that up the first thing in the morning.
But why must we have $2,000?
It's an oil deal, and it might come in.
Then again, it might not. But if it did...
What's the use trying to dream my way out of it?
Pete, maybe Papa can lend you the money.
- Maybe.
- But $2,000?
- You can ask him.
- I'm sorry, Rosalinda.
I'm superstitious about borrowing money that comes from heaven.
Oh, Pete.
Mr. Amendola.
I couldn't help overhearing you and Rosalinda talking out here.
It's not that I was eavesdrooping, or that I meant to listen.
L just had to get up and fill the cold water bottle.
You see, my feet get very hot at night.
I hope we didn't disturb you.
What disturbs me is this idea you got about Rosalinda and this guy Davis.
Believe me, there's nothing to it.
Why, if you'd look with your heart instead of your eyes... you could see where her best intentions are.
Look, Mr. Amendola, it isn't Rosalinda.
It's me.
Sure it's you.
I heard what you says about being broke.
And if you ask me, I think your get-up-and-go has got up and went.
What you need is confidence.
And listen. About that $2,000,
I'd be very glad to...
I couldn't take your money, Mr. Amendola.
Of course, the oil might come in... but right now, it's just a hole in the ground in California.
So what? Uncle Sam put money in a hole in the ground... and it turned out to be Fort Knox.
And I can take a risk, too.
But let's talk about it in the morning.
- Mama, where's Rosalinda?
- Went for a walk with the boy next door.
You know, Papa,
I think that's getting serious.
Serious? They might get married and have a couple of kids.
- But that's as far as it would go.
- Oh, Papa.
Mama, remember this?
Vaguely-
Some boy who was courting me used to sing it to me 22 years ago.
Who was that, now?
Was it the wealthy cattleman from Montana, or that drummer from Boston?
Mama, that was me.
Of course it was, Papa. And I've been singing myself to sleep with it ever since.
Sing it, Papa.
I remember.
- Yes, gentlemen?
- We're not together.
I'm Lieutenant Saunders, Police. I'm looking for a man named Louis Amendola.
That's me.
I'm Inspector Tainey,
Bureau of Internal Revenue.
- May I come in?
- Sure.
- What did you do, Papa?
- I don't know.
Unless I've been burning the incinerator after-hours.
Gentlemen, this is my wife.
Now all we need is the FBI.
Pardon me.
Callahan, FBI. Are you Mr. Amendola?
- Yes, sir. Won't you come in?
- Thanks.
Me and my big, fat mouth.
Mr. Amendola,
I'd like to ask you a few questions...
Do you mind? I was here first.
Mr. Amendola, the Department of Internal Revenue... would like some information regarding your source of income.
- Income?
- A report...
Please. May I?
We have a report showing you've been spending large sums of money... the source of which is not indicated in your previous income-tax reports.
We're a little curious, Mr. Amendola, to know where the money is coming from.
We saved a lot when we were the Human Pyramid.
And I took that money and I invested it wisely.
I'll have you know that I've majored in Economics at Cranfus College.
Cranfus? Never heard of that college.
That's like saying you never heard of Joe Tupis.
- Who's he?
- He's the President of Cranfus!
Mr. Amendola, we're not interested in your education.
We just want to know where you're getting the money.
All right, gentlemen. I'll tell you the truth.
I'm the long lost son of a very wealthy typhoon.
When I was only two days old, a nurse turned her back while changing me... and I was stolen from the cradle by a band of starving gypsies.
A few months ago, the king of the gypsies came and told me who my father was.
L see you don't believe me.
All right, I'll tell you the truth.
I was down at the beach, digging with my pail and shovel... when suddenly my shovel struck the top of an ironbound chest.
- Pirates' treasure?
- That's right.
That does it. Look here, Amendola, you've been reported for everything... from swiping tires off baby carriages to operating your own mint.
- What's your racket?
- Leave him alone.
Why can't we tell them the truth, darling?
It's so simple.
- All right, lady, what is the truth?
- Where does the money come from?
From heaven.
That explains everything.
But it's the truth.
It comes straight from heaven.
- $1,500 every week.
- On the dot.
I like the one about the pirates' chest better.
Come on, Amendola, let's go and tell it to the boys at the station.
But I can prove it. I can prove every word...
- Now, how can you prove it?
- It's easy.
I put this old rocking chair in the middle of the room... sit down there, and say a little prayer.
And when I say, "Rosalinda needs shoes..."
The money comes down like rain.
- All right, Mrs. Amendola, show us.
- Pull up the chair and say the prayer.
Wait a minute. She can't do it today.
The miracle happens on Thursday between 3:00 and 3:30.
- We'll be here Thursday at 3:00.
- Thursday at 3:00.
I should doubt my veracity.
Look.
And I hear they're both doing tremendous business.
They are? All right, come on, let's go.
Look.
How's business, Mr. Molinari?
Couldn't be better.
More orders than we can take care of.
Come on, Katie, let's go.
Clever man, that Amendola.
Soon he'll own the whole town.
You could've done the same, if you'd invested your money instead of hiding it.
Marx and Amendola Garage.
- Look at that.
- No, I won't look!
And don't stop every second.
I'm getting tired of this.
You know what I'm gonna do?
Lam gonna raise Amendola's rent again.
As of today! Come on.
Due to the increased cost of living,
I must raise the rent of this place.
Again?
This is the eighth time you've raised the rent since we moved in.
You're forcing me to join Landlords Anonymous.
You can move out if you want to.
Let's not be too hasty, Mr. Dingle.
You might be right.
Maybe the cost of living has increased.
I wouldn't know,
I haven't done today's shopping yet.
How much more do you want?
- $30? $125 a month? Why, it's robbery!
If you think that, you can start packing right now.
He didn't mean that, Mr. Dingle.
Did you, Papa?
Of course not.
I apologize, Mr. Dingle.
Why, for only $125 a month, where else could you find a place... where the sunshine comes streaming through the keyhole all day?
You're right.
You can't take advantage of me...
- like those bankrupt shop owners.
- Now, look here.
L only helped them out because no one else would.
And besides, I'm not making money on all those investments.
For instance, your son's oil venture.
I'll surely lose the $2,000 I invested in that.
You deserve to.
He couldn't take me for a sucker.
- I wouldn't give him a nickel.
- If you did... you'd probably shortchange him, you tight old buzzard.
That's done it. Another word out of you, and I'll punch you in the nose!
- Why, I'll...
- Papa! Mr. Dingle!
Why, you two should be friends, if only for our children's sake.
They love one another.
Who knows?
They might get married someday.
No son of mine will ever marry a girl with your daughter's reputation.
Get out!
Papa, the chair.
- It's broken.
- Get me some nails and glue.
I'll fix it. Hurry! It's almost time to pray.
"We are sorry to inform you that..."
Katie!
Yes, Frank?
Our gold mine is exhausted.
There'll be no more checks.
- Let's get going. It's almost 3:30.
- Okay.
All right, Mama.
Say it.
Rosalinda needs shoes.
- Look...
- Gentlemen, a little patience.
$1, 500 is a lot of money.
Sometimes we gotta ask twice.
Try it again, Mama.
Rosalinda needs shoes.
Once again.
Rosalinda needs shoes.
I guess you're right, Mama.
It seems the miracle is over.
I threw away $1,500 a week when I threw this chair.
It's not the chair.
It's that we have no excuse to ask for any more.
You're right.
But we're doing all right, now.
There's a lot of poor people praying in this world.
Now ifs their tum for miracles.
I'm moving out of here the first thing tomorrow morning.
Now even my cigarettes don't come down.
I'm afraid you won't have to wait till then.
You'll have to move now, down to the station.
Not so fast, Lieutenant. This is a tax matter.
He goes with me.
Wait a minute, you two.
I don't know what kind of a matter this is... but he's going with me for questioning.
- Question him at the station.
- I don't want to.
I want to question him at my field office.
I don't care where you question him.
He's going with me now.
Over my broken and splintered body.
I have no objection to taking him over your broken and splintered body.
Gentlemen, let's have cooperation.
Let him go with me.
Good night, Pete.
Good night, Rosalinda.
Mama, Papa, what's the matter?
These people don't understand where we're getting our money from.
So I'm going downtown and explaining it.
You stay here with Mother. ls there anything I can do?
Pardon us a moment, will you?
Look, I don't know how long
I'm gonna be gone.
Kinda keep an eye on things till I get back, will you?
Sure. But there's trouble. Ls it serious?
There's nothing to it.
With time off for good behavior,
I may only get life.
- All right, gentlemen, whose car do I go in?
- Mine.
I smell smoke.
So do I.
But, Dad, Mr. Amendola's in serious trouble.
Maybe the $2,000 would help him.
- You've got to give it to him.
- I think you should.
- He helped Pete.
- Helped him how?
To make an idiot out of himself by giving him $2,000".
For that crook Mulligan. I won't do it!
I won't give Amendola one penny.
Let him fry in his own fat. He belongs in jail.
But, Dad, this is important.
Frank, you're a hard-hearted, money-hoarding...
I'm going upstairs, where I don't have to listen to either one of you.
Help! I'm choking!
Don't worry, Dad.
Come on, Dad.
- I gotta get my money!
- Forget your money.
It's in a hole behind the bed.
Mom, I've got him.
The money!
I want to get the money!
Let me go!
The polar bear rug with the radio! I'll miss The Jimmy Durante Show.
Here it is, Papa!
- Thousands of dollars. It's all gone.
- Heaven knows you deserve it.
Are we insured, Pa?
Heck, no. Those chiselers don't get any of my money, no sir.
Good heavens, I'm not insured!
You have a very smart father. He trusts nobody but the hole behind the bed.
Pete, I'm so glad you're all right.
Thousands of dollars burning right now.
Brand-new, crisp $100 bills.
He put them in a hole behind his bed.
Every Thursday, $1,500.
Now it's all gone.
"Rosalinda needs shoes"?
Pull yourself together,
Mr. Dingle.
HI rebuild the house. It'll be better than new.
- You will?
- I don't know what to say.
It's perfectly all right,
Mrs. Dingle.
Why, anything to help a good neighbor.
The way I see it, now this is very definitely only a tax matter.
- This makes things much simpler.
- What do you mean?
Who owes the tax?
Amendola, or this other guy?
Naturally, the...
I guess Amendola. I don't know.
They both had incomes.
- Maybe they both owe us.
- How? It was this other fellow's income.
Sure. Amendola was only innocently using the other guy's money.
It was like a gift.
In that case, this man not only owes income tax, he'll have to pay us gift tax, too.
As far as I'm concerned, the local law is no longer interested.
Looks like it's out of my jurisdiction, too.
It's too involved for me.
I'm gonna forget all about till March 15.
- What did you find?
- Nothing but a dead squirrel.
He isn't dead. He's just overcome by smoke.
All he needs is a little fresh air.
Wonder what he was doing in the house.
That's the place for a little squirrel to be.
- Thanks for the lift.
- Okay.
Rupert.
Rupert.
My good old Rupert.
You haven't changed a bit.
You smell a little smoky, though.
Now, tell me, how was it?
How did the other squirrels treat you?
Were they good?
I've got good news for you.
I got a job with a circus, and we start in two weeks in Hoboken.
Me and two seals.
- Greetings, Mr. and Mrs. Dingle.
- Mr. Amendola.
- For your new home, Mrs. Dingle.
- Thank you.
- Go ahead, Papa.
- Make your speech.
Mr. Dingle... like a caterpillar has its cocoon... like a bird has its nest... like the worm has its... apple, believe me... it's a pleasure to present you with the key to your new home.
Mr. Amendola... you're the finest, the noblest, the most generous...
I wouldn't say that, Mr. Dingle.
But I'm glad he did.
I'm overwhelmed. I can't find words enough...
Words. What are words?
If it'll make you any happier,
I'll even carry you across the threshold.
Thank you, Mr. Amendola.
Our old home, Frank.
- And it's nicer than before.
- I'm glad you like it.
My little wife crocheted the doilies, but I'll have to take credit for the curtains.
I would have done a much better job, only my pinking shears were dull.
- Pete.
- Mulligan.
- Why, you dirty, double-crossing...
- No, wait a minute.
Let me go.
We're rich, Pete!
The oil is coming like a geyser.
What? The well came in?
Rosie, come down here, quick!
Phil.
You don't mean it, Phil?
Hey, look here, Davis!
Pete, listen. It's your music.
Phil just told me.
- What is it?
- Be quiet and listen to the radio.
...The Melody for Two
Orphaned Instruments by Peter Dingle.
You did this, Rosalinda.
You see what! Mean about taking a risk?
Speaking of risks, Pete, when are you gonna ask me to marry you?
Right now.
They're gonna get married.
Rosalinda.
Pete!
- Amendola, my friend.
- Dingle, old pal.
Alice in Wonderland
How do you get to Wonderland
Over the hill or under land
Orjust behind the tree
When clouds go rolling by
They roll away and leave the sky
Where is the land beyond the eye
That people cannot see
Where can it be
Where do stars go
Where is the grass that blooms
They must be somewhere
Where is the sunny afternoon
Alice in Wonderland
Where is the path to Wonderland
Over the hill or here or there
I wonder
Where
"... for if he does and had been of late...
"much accustomed to usurpation and conquest.
"Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him, and even Stigand-"
- Alice.
- Hmm?
- Oh, I'm listening.
- "And even Stigand,
"the Archbishop of Canterbury, agreed to meet with William... and offer him the Crown. "
"William's conduct at first was model-"
Alice. Will you kindly pay attention to your history lesson?
I'm sorry, but how can one possibly pay attention... to a book with no pictures in it?
My dear child, there are a great many good books in this world without pictures.
In this world, perhaps, but in my world, the books would be nothing but pictures.
Your world? Huh!
What nonsense.
- Now, once more.
- Nonsense?
- From the beginning.
- That's it, Dinah.
If I had a world of my own, everything would be nonsense.
Nothing would be what it is, because everything would be what it isn't, and contrariwise, what it is, it wouldn't be.
And what it wouldn't be, it would.
You see?
In my world, you wouldn't say "meow. "
You'd say,
"Yes, Miss Alice. "
Oh, but you would. You'd be just like people, Dinah.
And all the other animals too.
Why, in my world:
Cats and rabbits
Would reside in fancy little houses
And be dressed in shoes and hats and trousers
In a world of my own
All the flowers
Would have very extra-special powers
They would sit and talk to me
For hours, when I'm lonely
In a world of my own
There'd be new birds
Lots of nice and friendly how-de-do birds
Everyone would have a dozen bluebirds
Within that world
Of my own
I could listen
To a babbling brook
And hear a song that
I could understand
I keep wishing
It could be that way
Because my world would be
A wonderland.
Oh, Dinah. It's just a rabbit with a waistcoat- and a watch!
Oh, my fur and whiskers!
I'm late, I'm late, I'm late!
Now this is curious. What could a rabbit possibly be late for?
- Please, sir!
- I'm late, I'm late
For a very important date
No time to say hello, Goodbye
- I'm late, I'm late, I'm late
- It must be awfully important.
Like a party or something.
Mr Rabbit! Wait!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
I'm overdue
I'm really in a stew No time to say goodbye, Hello I'm late, I'm late, I'm late
My. What a peculiar place to have a party.
You know, Dinah, we really shouldn't... um- be doing this.
After all, we haven't been invited, and curiosity often leads to trouble.
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
Goodbye, Dinah.
Goodbye!
Oh.
Well, after this, I shall think nothing of fall-
Oh. Of falling down stairs.
Oh!
Ahh.
Whoa!
Goodness. What if I should fall right through... the centre of the earth-
Oh! And come out the other side... where people walk upside down?
Oh, but that's silly.
Nobody- Oh!
Oh, Mr Rabbit! Wait!
Please!
Curiouser and curiouser!
- Ohh!
- Oh! Oh, I beg your pardon.
Whew. Ha. It's quite all right, but you did give me quite a turn.
- You see, I was following-
- Rather good, what? Doorknob? Turn?
- Please, sir.
- Swell, huh?
One good turn deserves another.
What can I do for you?
Well, I'm looking for a white rabbit, so, um, if you don't mind-
Eh? Oh!
- There he is! I simply must get through.
- Sorry. You're much too big.
- Simple impassable.
- You mean impossible.
No, impassable.
Nothing's impossible.
- Why don't you try the bottle on the table?
- Table? Oh!
Read the directions and directly you'll be directed in the right direction.
"Drink me. "
Hmm. Better look first, for if one drinks much... from a bottle marked "poison," it's almost certain to disagree with one sooner or later.
- Beg your pardon?
- I was just giving myself some good advice.
But- Mmm.
Tastes like, uh, cherry tart.
Custard, pineapple, roast turkey. Goodness!
- What did I do?
- Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho.
You almost went out like a candle.
But look!
I'm just the right size.
Oh, no use.
I forgot to tell you.
I'm locked!
Oh, no!
Uh, but of course, uh, you've got the key, so-
- What key?
- Now don't tell me you've left it up there.
Oh, dear.
- Whatever will I do?
- Try the box, naturally.
Oh!
"Eat me. " All right, but goodness knows what this will do.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, oh!
What did you say?
I said, "A little of that went a long way. "
Well, I don't think it's so funny.
Now- Now I shall n- never get home!
Oh, come, come, now.
Crying won't help.
I know, but I-I-
I just can't-
I can't stop!
Come! Oh! Say, this won't do.
It won't do at all.
You! You up there!
Stop!
I say! Oh, look!
The bottle. The bottle!
Oh, dear. I do wish
I hadn't cried so much.
Oh, a sailor's life is the life for me
How I love to sail on the bounding sea
And I never, never, ever do a thing about the weather
For the weather never, ever does a thing for me
Oh, a sailor's life is the life for me
Tiddlee um pom pom
Deedle dum dum dee
And I never, ev-
Ahoy!
And other nautical expressions!
Land ho, by Jove!
- Where away, Dodo?
- Dodo?
Three points to starboard.
Pull away, me hearties.
Have you in port in no time at all.
- Oh, yo-ho-ho and a bottle of sea
- Uh, Mr Dodo! Please!
- We'll all fish fry as we sail the sea
- Please help me!
Um, uh, uh, pardon me, but, uh, would you mind helping me, please?
Yoo-hoo. Yoo-hoo!
Help me. Please!
Won't you-
Help me!
Forward, backward, inward, outward
Come and join the chase
Nothing could be drier than a jolly caucus race
Backward, forward, outward, inward bottom to the top
Never a beginning
There can never be a stop
Hopping, skipping, hopping, skipping
Fancy-free and gay
That's all they did tomorrow but you finished yesterday
Round and round and round we go until forevermore
Once we were behind but now we find we are be-
Forward, backward, inward, outward
Come and join the chase
Nothing could be drier than a jolly caucus race
Ah, backward-
I say! You'll never get dry that way.
- Get dry?
- Have to run with the others.
First rule of a caucus race, you know.
But how can I-
That's better. Have you dry in no time now.
No one can ever get dry this way.
Nonsense! Why, I'm as dry as a bone already.
- Yes, but-
- All right, chaps. Let's have it now.
Look lively.
The White Rabbit.
Mr Rabbit. M-Mr Rabbit-
- Oh, my goodness! I'm late. I'm late.
- Oh-oh, don't go away.
- I'll be right back.
- I'm late, I'm late.
- I'm late, I'm late. - Don't step on the fish! Uh, w-w-watch it there.
Stop kicking that mackerel.
Brilliant!Jolly well-
Mr Rabbit.
Oh, Mr Rabbit.
Oh, dear, I'm sure he came this way.
Do you suppose he could be hiding?
Hmm.
Not here.
I wonder.
No, I suppose he must've-
Oh! Why, what peculiar little figures.
Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum.
If you think we're waxworks, you ought to pay, you know.
Contrary to wax, if you think we're alive, you ought to speak to us.
- That's logic.
- Well, it's been nice meeting you.
Goodbye.
You're beginning backwards.
Aye, the first thing in a visit is to say:
How do you do and shake hands
Shake hands, shake hands
How do you do and shake hands and state your name and business
- That's manners.
- Really?
Well, my name is Alice, and I'm following a white rabbit, so-
- No, you can't go yet.
- No, the visit has just started.
- I'm very sorry.
- Would you like to play hide-and-seek?
- Or "Button, button, who's got the button"?
- No, thank you.
If you stay long enough, we might have a battle.
That's very kind of you, but I must be going.
- Why?
- Because I'm following a white rabbit.
- Why? - Well, I-I'm curious to know where he's going.
Oh, she's curious.
The oysters were curious, too, weren't they?
Aye, and you remember what happened to them.
- Poor things.
- Poor things.
Why? What did happen to the oysters?
- Oh, you wouldn't be interested.
- Oh, but I am.
No, no, you're in much too much of a hurry.
- Well, perhaps I could spare a little time.
- You could?
Well!
"The Walrus and the Carpenter. "
Or "The Story of the Curious Oysters. "
The sun was shining on the sea
Shining with all its might
He did his very best to make the billows smooth and bright
And this was odd because it was
The middle of the night
The walrus and the carpenter
Were walking close at hand
The beach was wide from side to side
But much too full of sand
Mr Walrus said the carpenter
My brain begins to perk
We'll sweep this clear in half a year
If you don't mind the work
Work!
- Th-The time has come
- The walrus said
To talk of other things.:
Of shoes and ships and sealing wax
And cabbages and kings
And why the sea is boiling hot and whether pigs have wings
Calloo, callay
No work today
We're cabbages and kings
Oh, uh, oysters, come out and walk with us.
The day is warm and bright.
A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk, would be a sheer delight.
Yes, and should we get hungry on the way, we'll stop and, uh, have a bite.
But Mother Oyster winked her eye
And shook her heavy head
She knew too well this was no time
To leave her oyster bed
The sea is nice
Take my advice
- And stay right here
- Mum said
Yes, yes, of course, of course, but, uh, ha-ha!
The time has come my little friends
To talk of other things
Of shoes and ships and sealing wax of cabbages and kings
And why the sea is boiling hot and, uh, whether pigs have wings
Calloo, callay
Come run away
With cabbages and kings
Well, now, uh, let me see.
Ah! A loaf of bread is what we chiefly need.
Listen, how 'bout some pepper and salt and vinegar, eh?
Well, yes, yes. Splendid idea.
Ha-ha. Very good indeed.
Now, if you're ready, oysters, dear, we can begin the feed.
- Feed?
- Oh, yes. Uh-
The time has come my little friends to talk of food and things
Of peppercorns and mustard seed and other seasonings
We'll mix 'em all together in a sauce that's fit for kings
Calloo, callay
We'll eat today
Like cabbages and kings
I, uh- I-I weep for you.
I- Oh, excuse me.
I deeply sympathize.
For I've enjoyed your company... oh, much more than you realize.
Little oysters.
Little oysters.
But answer there came none
And this was scarcely odd because
They'd been eaten, every one
Well, uh-
The time has come!
With cabbages
And kings
- The end.
- That was a very sad story.
Aye, and there's a moral to it.
Oh, yes, a very good moral, if you happen to be an oyster.
- Well, it's been a very nice visit-
- Another recitation.
- I'm sorry, but-
- Entitled "Father William. "
- But really, I'm-
- First verse.
You are old, Father William the young man said
And your hair has become very white
And yet you incessantly stand on your head
Do you think at your age it is right, it's right
Do you think at your age it is right
Well, in me youth
Father William replied to his son
I'd do it again and again and again
And I've done it again and again and again
I wonder who lives here.
Mary Ann! Oh, drat that girl.
Where could she have put them?
- Mary Ann!
- The rabbit!
Mary Ann!
No use! Can't wait! I'm awfully late.
Oh, me. Oh, my. Oh, me. Oh, my.
Excuse me, sir, but- but I've been trying to-
Why, Mary Ann!
What are you doing out here?
- Mary Ann?
- Don't just do something. Stand there. No, no! Go, go!
- Go get my gloves. I'm late!
- But late for what?
- That's just what I-
- My gloves!
- At once! Do you hear?
- Goodness.
I suppose I'll be taking orders from Dinah next.
Hmm. Now let me see.
If I were a rabbit, where would I keep my gloves?
Oh! Thank you.
Don't mind if I do.
Oh, no, no, not again.
Oh! Mary Ann!
Now you see here,
Mary Ann. Help!
I need help!
Whoo-hoo! Ha! Oh!
No! Help!
Monster! Help! Assistance!
- Oh, dear.
- A monster! A monster, Dodo!
- In my house, Dodo. Oh, my poor little-bitty house. - The dodo.
Steady. Steady, old chap. Can't be as bad as all that, you know.
Oh, my poor roof and rafters.
All my walls and- There it is!
By Jove!
Jolly well is, isn't it?
Well, do something, Doo-doo.
Yes, indeed. An extraordinary situation, but, uh-
But, but, but, but, but what?
But I have a very simple solution.
- Thank goodness.
- W-W-W-What is it?
- Simply pull it out the chimney.
- Yes, g-g-go on, go on. Pull it out.
Who, me?
Don't be ridiculous.
What we need is a- Uh-
- A lizard with a ladder!
- Hmm? Oh! Bill!
Bill! We need a lazard with a lidder- A lidder- A b-b-b-
- Can you help us?
- At your service, governor.
Bill, me lad, have you ever been down a chimney?
Why, governor, I've been down more chimneys-
Excellent, excellent.
You just pop down the chimney... and haul that monster out of there.
Righto, governor.
Monster?
Steady now. There.
That's better.
Bill, lad, you're passing up a golden opportunity.
- I am?
- You can be famous.
- I can?
- Of course!
There's a brave lad.
In you go now.
Nothing to it, old boy.
Simply tie your tail... around the monster's neck and drag it out.
- B-But-But, governor-
- Good luck, Bill.
Well, there goes Bill.
- Poor Bill.
- Uh, perhaps we should try a- a more energetic remedy.
Yes! Anything, anything.
But hurry!
Oh, I-I propose that we, uh-
- Yes, go on, go on. Yes, yes.
- I propose we, uh-
Oh!
By Jove! That's it.
We'll burn the house down.
Yes. Burn the house- What?
- Oh, no.
- Oh-ho-ho!
Oh, we'll smoke the blighter out
We'll put the beast to rout
Some kindling
A stick or two
Ah, this bit of rubbish ought to do
- Oh, dear
- We'll smoke the blighter out
- We'll smoke the monster out
- No, no! Not my beautiful bird house!
Oh, we'll roast the blighter's toes
We'll toast the bounder's nose
Just fetch that gate
We'll make it clear
- That monsters aren't welcome here
- Oh, dear. Oh, me, oh, my.
- A match? Thank you.
- Match?
Without a single doubt we'll smoke the monster out
We'll smoke the monster out
No! No!
My poor house and furniture.
Oh, dear.
This is serious.
I simply must- Ah!
A garden.
Perhaps if I ate something, it would make me grow smaller.
Let go! Help!
- I'm sorry, but I must eat something.
- Not me! You, you, you, you-
You barbarian!
Help!
Monster!
Help!
Ah! I'm late! Oh, dear.
I'm here. I should be there.
- I'm late, I'm late, I'm late.
- I say, do you have a match?
Oh, no. Must go. Goodbye.
Hello. I'm late, I'm late, I'm late.
- Wait! Please wait!
- Ah, young lady.
- Do you have a match?
- No, I-I'm sorry, but-
- Mr Rabbit!
- No cooperation. No cooperation at all.
Well, can't have monsters about.
Jolly well have to carry on alone.
Wait! Please!
Just a minute!
Oh, dear. I'll never catch him while I'm this small.
Why, what curious butterflies.
You mean bread-and-butterflies.
Oh, yes, of course, uh- Hmm?
Now who do you suppose-
A horsefly! I mean, a- a rocking horsefly.
- Naturally.
- I beg your pardon, but, uh, did you-
Oh, that's nonsense.
Flowers can't talk.
But of course we can talk, my dear.
If there's anyone worth talking to.
Or about.
- And we sing too.
- You do?
Oh, yes. Would you like to hear
"Tell It to the Tulips"?
- No, let's sing about us.
- We know one about the shy little violets.
- Oh, no, not that old thing.
- Let's do "Lovely Lily of the Valley. "
- How 'bout a daisy duet? - Oh, she wouldn't like that. - Oh, watch the rose.
Girls! We shall sing
"Golden Afternoon. "
That's about all of us.
Sound your "A," Lily.
La
Mi, mi, mi, mi, mi, mi mi, mi, mi, mi, mi, mi
La, la, la, la la, la, la, la, la
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Dum du dum-dum
Little bread-and-butterflies kiss the tulips
And the sun is like a toy balloon
There are
Get-up-in-the-morning glories
In the golden afternoon
There are dizzy daffodils on the hillside
Strings of violets are all in tune
Tiger lilies love the dandelions
In the golden afternoon
The gold afternoon
There are dog- and cat-erpillars
And a copper centipede
Where the lazy daisies
Love the very
Peaceful life
They lead
You can learn a lot of things from the flowers
For especially in the month ofJune
Ah, ah, ah, ah
There's a wealth
Of happiness and romance
All in the golden
Afternoon
All in the golden afternoon
The golden afternoon
You can learn a lot of things from the flowers
For especially in the month ofJune
There's a wealth of happiness
And romance
All-
The golden afternoon
Ah
- Oh, that was lovely!
- Thank you, my dear.
What kind of garden do you come from?
Oh, I don't come from any garden.
Do you suppose she's a wild flower?
Oh, no.
I'm not a wild flower.
Just what specie- or shall we say genus- are you, my dear?
Well, I suppose you'd call me... a Genus Humanus Alice.
Ever see an Alice with a blossom like that?
Come to think of it, did you ever see an Alice?
Yes. And did you notice her petals?
What a peculiar colour.
And no fragrance.
Just look at those stems.
Rather scrawny, I'd say.
I think she's pretty.
- Quiet, bud.
- But I'm not a flower.
Aha!Just as I suspected.
She's nothing but a common
Mobile Vulgaris.
Oh, no!
- A common what?
- To put it bluntly:
- A weed.
- I'm not a weed.
- Well, you wouldn't expect her to admit it.
- Can you imagine?
- Well, goodness!
- Don't let her stay here and go to seed.
- Go on now. Don't you take root-
- Please, girls!
We don't want weeds in our bed.
Move along, move along.
All right, if that's the way you feel about it.
If I were my right size, I could pick every one of you if I wanted to.
And I guess that would teach you.
You can learn a lot of things from the flowers.
Hm! Seems to me they could learn a few things about manners.
A
E- I-O-U
A- E-I-O-U
A- E-I-O-U
Who
U- E-I-O-A
U- E-I-A
A- E-I-O-U
Who are you?
Well, I-I-I hardly know, sir.
I've changed so many times since this morning, you see-
I do not see.
Explain yourself.
I'm afraid I can't explain myself, sir, because I'm not myself, you know.
I do not know.
Well, I can't put it any more clearly, for it isn't clear to me.
You? Who are you?
Well, don't you think you ought to tell me... who you are first?
Why?
Oh, dear, everything is so confusing.
- It is not.
- Well, it is to me.
- Why? - Well, I can't remember things as I used to, and-
- Recite.
- Hmm?
Oh. Oh, oh, yes, sir. Um-
How doth the little busy bee improve each shin-
Stop.
That is not spoken correct-ically.
It goes:
How-
How doth the little crocodile... improve his shining tail... and pour the waters of the Nile... on every golden scale?
How cheer-
How cheer-
How cheerfully he seems to grin.
How neatly spreads his claws... and welcomes little fishes in... with gently smiling jaws.
Well, I must say I've never heard it that way before.
I know.
I have improved it.
Well- If you ask me-
You? Heh!
Who are you?
Oh!
Uh, you there. Girl!
Wait! Come back!
I have something important to say.
Oh, dear.
I wonder what he wants now.
Well?
Keep your temper.
- Is that all?
- No.
Exact-ically what is your problem?
Well, it's exact-ically- exact-ical-
Well, it's precisely this:
I should like to be a little larger, sir.
- Why?
- Well, after all, three inches is such a wretched height-
I am exact-ically three inches high!
And it is a very good height indeed!
But I'm not used to it, and you needn't... shout!
- Oh, dear.
- By the way, I have a few more helpful hints.
One side will make you grow taller.
- One side of what?
- And the other side will make you grow shorter.
- The other side of what?
- The mushroom, of course!
Hmm.
One side will make me grow-
But which is which?
Hmm. After all that's happened, I-
I wonder if I-
I don't care.
I'm tired of being only three inches high.
Yi, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi!
A serpent! Help!
Help! Serpent! Serpent!
Oh, but please, please!
Off with you! Shoo! Shoo!
Go away! Serpent! Serpent!
- But I'm not a serpent.
- Ser- Indeed?
- Then just what are you?
- I'm just a little girl.
Little? Ha! Little?
Well, I am.
I mean, I-I was.
And I suppose you don't eat eggs either.
- Yes, I do, but, but, but-
- Ah! I knew it! I knew it.
Serpent. Serpent!
Oh, for goodness' sake.
Hmm! And the other side will-
The very idea.
Spend all my time laying eggs for serpents like her.
Goodness. I wonder if I'll ever get the knack of it.
There. That's much better.
Hmm. Better save these.
Now let's see.
Where was I?
Hmm. I- I wonder which way I ought to go.
'Twas brillig
And the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe
All mimsy were the borogroves
And the mome raths outgrabe
Now where in the world do you suppose that-
- Lose something?
- Oh!
Oh, uh- I-
I was- N-No.
I- I-I mean, I-I was just wondering-
Oh, that's quite all right.
Uh, one moment, please.
Ooh.
Second chorus.
'Twas brillig
And the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe
Why- Why, you're a cat.
A Cheshire cat.
All mimsy
Were the borogroves
Oh, wait!
Don't go, please.
There you are.
Third chorus.
Oh, no, no, no.
Thank you, but-
But I just wanted to ask you which way I ought to go.
Well, that depends... on where you want to get to.
Oh, it really doesn't matter, as long as I-
Then it really doesn't matter... which way you go.
And the mome raths outgrabe
Oh, by the way.
If you'd really like to know, he went that way.
- Who did?
- The White Rabbit.
- He did?
- He did what?
- Went that way.
- Who did?
- The White Rabbit.
- What rabbit?
But didn't you just say-
I mean- Oh, dear.
Can you stand on your head?
- Oh!
- However, if I were looking for a white rabbit,
I'd ask the Mad Hatter.
The Mad Hatter? Um, no, no, I-I don't think-
Or there's the March Hare... in that direction.
Uh, thank you. I-I think
I shall visit him.
Of course, he's mad too.
Oh, but I don't want to go among mad people.
Oh, you can't help that.
Most everyone's mad here.
You may have noticed... that I'm not all there myself.
And the mome raths outgrabe
Goodness. If the people here are like that, I-
I must try not to upset them.
How very curious.
If there are no objections let it be unanimous
- Oh, a very merry unbirthday
- A very merry unbirthday
A very merry unbirthday to us
A very merry unbirthday to me
- To who - To me - Oh, you
A very merry unbirthday to you
- Who, me -
Yes, you - Oh, me
Let's all congratulate us with another cup of tea
A very merry unbirthday
To
You
- No room, no room, no room.
- No vacancy.
- No room, no room, no room!
- But I thought there was plenty of room.
Ah, but it's very rude to sit down without being invited.
I'll say it's rude.
It's very, very rude indeed.
Very, very, very rude indeed.
Oh, I'm very sorry, but I did enjoy your singing, and I wondered if you could tell me-
You enjoyed our singing?
Oh, what a delightful child.
Things happen. I'm so excited!
We never get compliments.
- You must have a cup of tea.
- Ah, yes, indeed, the tea.
- You must have a cup of tea.
- That would be very nice.
I'm sorry I interrupted your birthday party.
- Uh-uh, thank you.
- Birthday? Ha-ha-ha.
My dear child, this is not a birthday party.
Of course not.
This is an unbirthday party.
Unbirthday? Oh, I'm sorry, but I don't quite understand.
It's very simple.
Now, 30 days hath Sept-
No. Well. An unbirthday-
If you have a birthday, then, you-
- She doesn't know what an unbirthday is.
- How silly!
Well, I-
I shall elucidate.
Now statistics prove prove that you've one birthday
Imagine.:just one birthday every year
Ah, but there are
364 unbirthdays
Precisely why we're gathered here to cheer
Why, then, today is my unbirthday too.
- It is?
- What a small world this is.
In that case-
- A very merry unbirthday
- To me
- To you
- A very merry unbirthday
- For me
- For you
Now blow the candle out, my dear and make your wish come true
A very merry unbirthday
To you
Twinkle, twinkle, little bat,
How I wonder what you're at.
Up above the world you fly...
Like a tea-tray in the sky.
- Oh, that was lovely.
- And, uh, and now, my dear, uh, you were saying that you would like to seek-
Pardon me.
Uh, you were seeking, uh, some information of some kind?
Oh, yes. You see,
I'm looking for a-
Clean cup, clean cup.
Move down!
- But I haven't used my cup.
- Drink up, drink up
Move down, move down
Drink up, drink up, move down
Would you like a little more tea?
Well, I haven't had any yet, so I can't very well take more.
Ah, you mean you can't very well take less.
Yes. You can always take more than nothing.
- But I only meant that-
- And now, my dear, something, uh, seems to be troubling you.
Uh, won't you tell us all about it?
- Start at the beginning.
- Yes, yes.
And when you come to the end, stop, see?
Well, it all started... while I was sitting on the riverbank with Dinah.
Very interesting.
- Who's Dinah?
- Why, Dinah's my cat. You see-
Ah! Cat?
- Get the jam. On his nose. Put it on his nose.
- On his nose, on his nose.
- C-C-Cat.
- Oh. Oh.
My goodness. Those are the things that upset me.
See all the trouble you've started?
- But really, I didn't think that-
- Ah, but that's the point.
- If you don't think, you shouldn't talk.
- Clean cup, clean cup.
Move down, move down, move down!
- But I still haven't used-
- Move down, move down, move down
Move down
And now, my dear, as you were saying?
Oh, yes. I was sitting on the riverbank with, uh, with you-know-who.
I do?
I mean my c-a-t.
Tea?
Just half a cup, if you don't mind.
Come, come, my dear.
Don't you care for tea?
Why, yes, I'm very fond of tea, but-
If you don't care for tea, you could at least make polite conversation.
Well, I've been trying to ask you-
I have an excellent idea.
Let's change the subject.
Why is a raven like a writing desk?
Riddles?
Let me see now.
Why is a raven like a writing desk?
- I beg your pardon?
- Why is a raven like a writing desk?
- Why is a what?
- Careful. She's stark, ravin' mad.
But, but it's your silly riddle.
You just said-
- Steady. Don't get excited.
- How about a nice cup of tea?
Have a cup of tea, indeed. Well,
I'm sorry, but I just haven't the time.
The time! The time!
Who's got the time?
No, no, no, no. No time, no time, no time.
Hello. Goodbye.
I'm late. I'm late.
- The White Rabbit!
- Oh, I'm so late.
I'm so very, very late.
Well, no wonder you're late. Why, this clock is exactly two days slow.
- Two days slow?
- Course you're late.
My goodness.
We'll have to look into this. Aha!
I see what's wrong with this.
Why, this watch is full of wheels.
Oh, my poor watch.
Oh, my wheels and springs.
- But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but- - Butter! Of course!
It needs some butter.
Butter!
- Butter!
- But-but-butter?
Butter. Oh, thank you.
Butter. Yes, that's fine.
Oh, no, no! No, no, no!
You'll get crumbs in it.
Oh, this is the very best butter.
What are you talking about?
- Tea?
- Tea! Oh, I never thought of tea! Of course.
- Don't! Don't! Not tea!
- Tea.
- Sugar?
- Sugar? Two spoons. Yes, y- Two spoons.
- Thank you, yes.
- Oh, please be careful!
- Jam?
- Jam! I forgot all about the jam.
- No! Not jam!
- Just shows you what a person'll do.
- Mustard?
- Mustard, yes! Mus-
Mustard?
Don't let's be silly.
Lemon- that's different.
That's- There.
That should do it.
- Look at that. - It's going mad. - Oh, my goodness.
- Oh, dear. - It's going mad.
Mad watch. - Oh, my goodness.
- I can't understand it. It was the best butter.
- Mad watch. Mad watch.
- Mad watch! - Oh, look. Do you think the springs- Oh, my goodness!
There's only one way to stop a mad watch.
Two days slow.
That's what it is.
- Oh, my watch.
- It was?
And it was an unbirthday present too.
- Well, in that case.
- A very merry unbirthday
To
- You
- Mr Rabbit.
Oh, Mr Rabbit! Oh, now where did he go to?
A very merry unbirthday to us, to us
- If there are no objections let it be unanimous
- Of all the silly nonsense.
This is the stupidest tea party
I've ever been to in all my life.
Well, I've had enough nonsense.
I'm going home.
Straight home.
That rabbit. Who cares where he's going anyway?
Why, if it hadn't been for him, I-
"Tulgey Wood. "
Hmm. Curious.
I don't remember this.
Now let me see.
Oh!
Mmm, no, no, please.
No more nonsense.
Now, if I came this way,
I should go back this way.
Oh, I-I beg your pardon.
My goodness. When I get home,
I shall write a book about this place.
If I- If I ever do get home.
Oh, uh, excuse me.
Um, could one of you tell me-
Uh- Heh-heh. Never mind.
Oh, dear. It's getting dreadfully dark.
And nothing looks familiar.
I shall certainly be glad to get out of- Oh!
Who. Who-who.
Who.
It would be so nice if something would make sense for a change.
Oh!
"Don't step on the mome raths. "
The mome raths?
A path!
Oh, thank goodness.
Ah. I just knew I'd find one sooner or later.
If I hurry fast, I might even be home in time for tea.
Oh. Oh, won't Dinah be happy to see me.
Oh, I just can't wait till I- Ah!
Oh, dear. Now I-
Now I shall never get out.
Well, when- when one's lost,
I- I suppose it's good advice... to stay where you are until someone finds you.
But- But who'd ever think to look for me here?
Good advice.
If, If, If, If I'd listened earlier, I-I wouldn't be here.
But- But that's just the trouble with me.
I give myself very good advice.
But I very seldom follow it
That explains
The trouble that
I'm always in
Be patient
Is very good advice
But the waiting makes me curious
And I'd love the change
Should something strange
Begin
Well, I went along my merry way.
And I never stopped to reason.
I should have known
There'd be a price to pay
Someday
I give myself
Very good advice
But I very seldom follow it
Will I ever learn
To do the things
I should
Will I ever learn
Learn to do the things
I should
And the mome raths outgrabe
Oh, Cheshire Cat!
It's you!
Whom did you expect?
The White Rabbit perchance?
Oh, no, no, no.
I- I-I'm through with rabbits.
I wanna go home!
- But I can't find my way.
- Naturally.
That's because you have no way.
All ways here, you see, are the Queen's way.
- But I've never met any Queen.
- You haven't?
You haven't?
Oh, but you must!
She'll be mad about you.
Simply mad.
And the mome raths outgrabe
Please, please! Uh, how can I find her?
Well, some go this way.
Some go that way.
But as for me, myself, personally,
I prefer the short cut.
Painting the roses red
We're painting the roses red
We dare not stop or waste a drop
So let the paint be spread
We're painting the roses red
Oh, painting the roses red
And many a tear we shed
- Because we know
- They'll cease to grow
In fact they'll soon be dead
Ohh, and yet we go ahead
Painting the roses red, red red, red, red, red, red, red
Painting the roses red
We're painting the roses red
Oh, pardon me, but, Mr Three why must you paint them red
Huh? Oh!
Well, the fact is, miss, we planted the white roses by mistake, and-
The Queen she likes them red
If she saw white instead
- She'd raise a fuss
- And each of us
- Would quickly lose his head
- Goodness!
Since this is the thought we dread
- We're painting the roses red
- Oh, dear.
Then let me help you.
- Painting the roses red
- We're painting the roses red
Don't tell the Queen what you have seen
Or say that's what we said but we're painting the roses red
Yes, painting the roses red
- Not pink - Not green - Not aquamarine
We're painting the roses red
- The Queen!
- The Queen!
- Queen!
- The Queen!
Cards, halt!
Sound off!
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, jack!
The rabbit.
H- H-Her Imperial Highness,
Her, Her Grace,
Her Excellency, Her Royal
Majesty, the Queen of Hearts!
- And the King.
- Hooray!
Hmm! Who's been painting my roses red?
Who's been painting my roses red?
Who dares to paint with vulgar paint
The Royal flower bed
For painting my roses red
Someone will lose his head
Oh, no, Your Majesty, please!
It's all his fault!
Not me, Your Grace!
The ace! The ace!
- You? The deuce, you say?
- No! Two!
- Not me! The trey!
- That's enough!
Off with their heads!
They're going to lose their heads
For painting the roses red
It serves them right, they planted white
The roses should be red
Oh, they're going to lose their heads
Silence!
Oh, please, please.
They were only trying-
- And who is this?
- Uh, well. Well, well, now, uh, uh, let me see, my dear.
It certainly isn't a heart.
Uh, do you suppose it's a club?
Why, it's a little girl.
- Yes. A-And I was hoping-
- Look up. Speak nicely.
And don't twiddle your fingers!
Turn out your toes. Curtsy.
Open your mouth a little wider.
And always say:
"Yes, Your Majesty. "
"Yes, Your Majesty. "
Now, um, where do you come from, and where are you going?
W- Well, I-I'm trying to find my way home.
Your way? All ways here are my ways!
Well, yes, I-I know.
But I was just thinking-
Curtsy while you're thinking.
It saves time.
Uh, yes, Your Majesty.
But I was only going to ask-
I'll ask the questions!
Do you play croquet?
- Why, yes, Your Majesty.
- Then let the game begin!
To your places. To your places. By order of the King. Hurry, hurry, hurry.
Shuffle deck!
Card cut! Deal cards!
Cards, halt!
Silence!
Off with his head!
Off with his head. Off with his head. By order of the King. Uh, you heard what she said.
- You're next, my dear.
- Oh, but-
Uh, yes, Your Majesty.
Oh!
- Stop!
- Oh, of all the impossible-
Do you want us both to lose our heads?
- Uh-huh.
- Well, I don't.
Uh, I say, how are you getting on?
- Not at all.
- Beg pardon?
I said, not at all!
Who are you talking to?
- Oh, uh, a cat, Your Majesty.
- Cat? Where?
There. Oh.
- Oh, there he is again!
- I warn you, child, if I lose my temper, you lose your head!
Understand?
You know, we could make her really angry. Shall we try?
- Oh, no, no!
- Oh, but it's loads of fun.
No, no, no! Stop!
Oh, no!
Oh, my fur and whiskers!
Oh, dear! Save the Queen.
Someone's head will roll for this!
Yours!
- Off with her-
- But, but, but, but consider, my dear.
Uh, couldn't she have a trial? Huh? First?
- Trial?
- Well, th-Just a, a little trial? Hmm?
Hmm. Very well, then.
Let the trial begin!
Your Majesty.
Members of the jury.
Loyal subjects.
And the King.
The prisoner at the bar is charged with enticing Her Majesty, the Queen of Hearts, into a game of croquet and thereby willfully...
- But- - and with malice aforethought, teasing, tormenting...
- and otherwise annoying our beloved-
- Never mind all that!
Get to the part where
I lose my temper.
Thereby causing the Queen to lose her temper.
Now, are you ready for your sentence?
Sentence? Oh, but there must be a verdict first.
Sentence first!
Verdict afterwards.
- But that just isn't the way!
- All ways are-
Your ways, Your Majesty.
Uh, yes, my child.
Off with her-
- But consider, my dear. Eh, we've called no witnesses.
- Huh?
Uh, couldn't we hear maybe one or two? Huh? Maybe?
Oh, very well.
But get on with it!
- First witness. First witness. Herald, call the first witness.
- The March Hare.
Uh, oh, oh, what do you know about this, uh, unfortunate affair?
- Nothing.
- Nothing whatever?
- Nothing whatever!
- That's very important!
Jury, write that down.
Uh, unimportant, uh,
Your Majesty means of course.
Silence! Next witness.
The Dormouse.
- Well-
- Shh!
What have you to say about this?
Twinkle, twinkle, little bat.
How I wonder-
That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet.
Write that down!
- Twinkle, twinkle. Twinkle, twinkle.
- Twinkle, twinkle.
Twinkle, twinkle.
What next?
The Mad Hatter.
- Off with your hat!
- Oh, my!
And, uh, where were you when this horrible crime was committed?
I was home drinking tea.
Today, you know, is my unbirthday.
Why, my dear, today is your unbirthday too.
- It is?
- It is?
It is?
- A very merry unbirthday
- To me?
- Oh, no!
- To you! A very merry unbirthday
- For me?
- For you!
Now blow the candle out, my dear, and make your wish come true.
A very merry unbirthday
To you
Oh! Your Majesty.
Uh, yes, my dear?
Look! There he is now!
- Huh? Wha- Who?
- The Cheshire Cat.
- Cat!
- Cat?
- Cat! Cat, cat, cat, cat!
- There he goes! There he goes!
- Oh, this is terrible! Help! Help!
- Stop him! Stop him!
- Stop him. Catch him.
- Somebody help me. Catch him.
- Get me the jam. The jam, quick.
- The jam! The jam! By order of the King.
The jam. Let me have it!
Somebody's head is going to roll for this!
- Aha!
- The mushroom.
Off with her h-
Oh, pooh. I'm not afraid of you.
Why, you're nothing but a pack of cards.
Rule 42: "All persons more than a mile high... must leave the court immediately. "
I am not a mile high.
And I'm not leaving.
Sorry. Rule 42, you know.
And as for you,
Your Majesty-
Your Majesty indeed.
Why, you're not a queen.
You're just a, a fat, pompous, bad-tempered, old ty- tyrant.
And, uh, what were you saying, my dear?
Well, she simply said that you're a fat, pompous, bad-tempered, old tyrant.
Off with her head!
You heard what
Her Majesty said.
Off with her head.
Forward, backward, inward, outward
Here we go again
No one ever loses and no one can ever win
Backward, forward, outward, inward bottom to the top
- Never let the-
- Off with her head!
Off with her head!
Just a moment! You can't leave a tea party without having a cup of tea, you know.
- But I can't stop now.
- Ah, but we insist.
You must join us in a cup of tea.
Off with her head!
Mr Caterpillar, what will I do?
Who are you?
There she goes.
Don't let her get away!
Off with her head!
Oh! Still locked, you know.
But the Queen!
I simply must get out!
- But you are outside.
- What?
See for yourself.
Why- Why, that's me!
- I'm asleep.
- Don't let her get away!
- Off with her head!
- Alice, wake up. Please wake up, Alice!
- Alice! Please wake up, Alice!
- Off with her head!
Alice! Alice. Alice.
Alice. Alice.
Will you kindly pay attention and recite your lesson?
Hmm? Oh. Oh! Uh, how doth the little crocodile improve his shining tail?
- And pour the waters of the-
- Alice, what are you talking about?
Oh. I'm sorry. But you see, the caterpillar said-
Caterpillar?
Oh, for goodness' sake.
Alice, I- Oh, well.
Come along. It's time for tea.
Alice in Wonderland

Don't cry. Janie. Don't cry.
You'll be all light soon.
Come on. Janie. don't cry.
NARRATOR: Kids think nothing ever happened before they were born.
But what happened to all of us...
began the day my mother and father gut all the steamboat...
in Eureka, Wisconsin.
It was September. 1856.
Oh. heh. I wonder. uh. could you direct a body to the house ol Will Jamison?
Oh, heh, for... Forgive me for not introducing myself.
My name's Robert Strong Eunson.
And I come from the Shetland Isles.
My wife's uncle Will Jamison wrote us a letter inviting us to America.
Will never mentioned it.
Well. that's the Jamisons for you.
Closemouthed, eh, Mamie?
Excuse me. this is my missus.
- Mister ...?
- Bradley, Harry Bradley.
Well. we're pleased to make your acquaintance, MI. Bradley.
- This is Howard Tyler.
- Pleased to meet you, MI. Tyler.
I'm afraid you folks must prepare yourself for a shock.
- Oh?
- Will Jamison's dead.
His house burned to the ground three weeks ago.
[MAMIE SOBBING]
Now. lass... you hadn't seen your uncle since you were a wee one.
Don't grieve.
We work and slave and pinch our pennies 10! the journey... with the family telling us how foolhardy we are.
Aye. lass. aye.
But we wanted the baby to be born in the New World.
MAN:
Hello. Hello there.
Whoa. whoa. boy.
Well. come on. Lela.
We heard that you young folks had come out here.
Hany Bradley should've had better sense than to let you.
I'm Dr. Delbert and this is my wife.
Oh. how do you do. doctor?
Mrs. Delbert? This is my missus.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
- You're coming straight home with us.
- Oh, no. No, thank you.
We have money to pay
10! a night's lodging at the inn.
Oh, no. I'm afraid there isn't any inn this side of Oshkosh.
We're certainly not going to let you go to the stable.
- Thank you. but we couldn't be a bother...
- No bother at all.
Come along. deal.
You can have the gills' loom.
They'll sleep on the parlor ﬂoor.
They've done it before.
[THUNDER CRACKING]
Rob. where are you?
Right here. lass.
There. jo.
There. there. there.
Jo.
It wouldn't be pains you're feeling, would it?
Oh. would you...?
Would you like a tumbler ol water?
Oh. jo. there. there. now.
You're not to fret.
Tomorrow we start back to Fail Isle.
With me like this and only $45 in your belt?
Well. then...
You remember Green Bay... the city on the water where we purchased the nanny goat?
I'll find work to do there in one of the sawmills or grist mills... and work.
Couldn't you find“?
Couldn't you find work herein Eureka... and we'd be put?
Not flying off hither and thither to that Blue Bay or this Green Bay.
Well, the men on the riverboat, they were talking of the logging camps.
No.
A man cannot leave his wife to fend for herself and a newborn. No.
Don't worry about Robbie and me.
Robbie?
Then you've named the lad? Hm?
If it does not displease you.
Not if you think you can stand having two Roberts underfoot.
WOMAN:
Whoa.
- Well. how are you, Mrs. Runyon?
- Fine. 'fine. thank you.
Well. that's good. Good to see you.
Well. what's that?
Hm? Oh. that's a pump.
Well. I know it's a pump.
But inside the cabin?
- Aye, Mrs. Runyon.
- Why, I never heard of such a thing.
[LAUGHING] Neither did I.
But with the baby coming next month and myself in the woods all winter... well, a man don't want his missus digging her way through drifts... to the pump each morning.
Well, folks will think it's queer, you being immigrants and all.
Well. uh. ma'am...
I don't know why folks would think it queer...
“.101 a man to want to ease a burden on his missus.
You've only been here two weeks.
Does Mrs. Eunson think she's better than other folks?
Mrs. Runyon... in the words of our great poet,
Bobbie Burns:
It's hardly in a body's power
To keep at times from being sour
Giddap! Giddap!
Uh... Don't worry.
Where's that boy?
Where's that lad? Where is he?
- I can help you with the lower logs.
- In your condition. I won't allow it.
But it's because of my condition you've got to hurry.
I still don't see how you and just one young lad... can get the cabin up in time.
Beggars cannot be choosers.
When you're pool and got no money... you gotta make do with what the good Lord sends you.
I got help.
We'll have he! up by sundown.
Oh. lad. lad.
You shouldn't have done that.
I've got no money to pay grown men's wages.
You wouldn't be offering us money, would you?
No. but a man is worthy oi his hire.
But not on the Lord's Day and not ii it's your neighbors.
Come on. everyone. let's go.
And only a fortnight ago, we didn't have one friend in all America.
[BELL CLANGING]
Uh...
I don't know what to say.
Well. don't say a thing.
We were glad to do it.
Would you hand me the yeast?
Thank you.
We're proud to have you as a neighbor.
Mr. Eunson.
Look. Mrs. Delbert.
I brought you a setting of buckwheat yeast.
Tend ii. replenish it and keep it warm.
And it will live as long as you do.
Good night.
BRADLEY:
Come on. everyone. let's go.
I wanted to make a speech.
The Wall's run dry.
Oh. has it? I doubt that.
Here.
Ah. Rob. you should have married a practical woman.
Well. there was a woman on the mainland had he! cap set 10! me.
And he! name was...?
Oh. the name is ol no importance.
But naturally, she could cook and bake and fish... and. naturally. prime a pump.
And why didn't you many this cooker and baker and fisher and pump-primer?
Because she was as homely as a peat bog.
Now, now, is this the time and place for a respectable married worn"?
[SIZZLING]
The soup.
Deal me.
What a mess.
Pump-primer.
[ROBERT CHUCKLES]
- Rob.
- Mm?
What day is it?
Today is Sunday, October 12th.
Why, jo?
To remember the baby's birthday.
Oh.
- You mean the time's upon you?
- I think so.
Ale you warm enough?
Would you like a spot ol broth?
- I'm going to have a baby.
- Baby.
- Now. there's only one thing 10! you to do.
- Aye.
- Go and find the midwife.
- Aye.
October 12. October 12.
Why. that's the birthday ol Columbus.
The man who discovered America 10! us.
[ROBERT CHUCKLES]
Mrs. Pugmister, hurry. please.
- Please hurry, Mrs. Pugmister.
- There's no rush, Mr. Eunson.
- It's the first one.
- No lush?
No lush. you say.
Mrs. Pugmister, she's in mortal agony.
- Call out if you need me.
- I'll not be needing you.
But there might be something a man can do.
You've already done it.
[BELL CLANGING]
Mrs. Pugmister.
What are you making that racket for?
Let the folks know what we've got.
We've got something then?
Might I ask what it is we got?
I ling this bell when it's a boy.
I blow this whistle... when it's a gill.
NARRATOR: So the night I was burn,
Papa went off to the woods.
He walked all night...
and it was daylight when he got to Cullen's logging camp.
Come on. men. Move.
Good day. Now. I want a lot ol work out ol you.
All right, the rest of you men, come on out here.
- Could you tell me where MI. Cullen is?
- Cullen.
Come on, boys, move on.
Or it'll be over before we get out there.
- Why don't you look where you're going?
- Oh. I'm sorry.
Well, what is it? What do you want?
I'm. uh. Robert Strong Eunson and I'm ready 10! work. MI. Cullen.
Well. and what kind ol work might you be ready 101?
You said you'd use me as a chopper.
Oh. I did. did I?
And what did I say
I'd be paying you, Nevsky?
Uh. twenty dollars a month.
But not to plough through the snow all night and use up all your energy.
Can you give a good 13 hours' work
10! the company?
I'd be much obliged if you'd watch me, Mr. Cullen.
I'll do just that, Norsky.
Get one thing straight, Mr. Cullen.
I have no doubt the Scandinavians are a fine lace... but it just so happens I'm Scottish.
Stop telling me your family history on the company's time.
The stand of timber's that way.
Half a mile.
Get an ax and keep your nose clean.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
He's going to glow up to be a great, big. strong man.
It's blowing up something.
The Wind's from the north.
- Oh. Katie. Lela.
- I'm glad to see you.
[WOMEN CHATTERING]
I've. uh...
I've made you some scones.
LELA: Yes.
KATIE: How is your...?
MRS. BRADLEY: Nothing like a baby in the house. They're so cute.
- My mother's recipe.
KATIE: I know.
But when they get to be about eight months. Oh. my.
MRS. BRADLEY: I know it.
KATIE: Then it's friends...
MRS. BRADLEY: When they start...
KATIE: Oh. yes.
- But then it's very sad.
LELA: Yes. ol course. but...
KATIE: When a child is about 10.
LELA: Oh. deal.
Where am I going to sit them?
My deal. when doctor and I first came to the wilderness... we had only one chair.
Don ' t worry.
- Ladies. tea is ready.
- Oh. tea.
A hot cup ol tea will be good alter that long walk.
- Yes.
- I should say.
[ROBERT COUGHS]
Robbie. Robbie.
Is this a propel welcome when I've walked 25 miles...
"because I was hungry
10! the sight ol you?
- Come here.
- Oh. no. Hob.
Rob. please. please. We've got company.
Oh. ladies. forgive me.
LELA: Congratulations again.
- Thank you.
- We had such a lovely tea time.
- Did you see my bully lad?
LELA: It's no problem. it's all light.
MAMIE: I'm so glad you joined us.
LELA:
Oh. thank you. Mamie.
- Why, he favors me.
- And who has a better right?
MRS. BRADLEY:
Oh. what fine heavy pelts.
- They're lovely, aren't they, Mrs. Bradley?
- Oh, yes.
Oh. my husband can get you a good price.
Well. thank you. Mrs. Bradley.
But these are not 10! sale.
I trapped them myself near the lumber camp.
Excuse me.
Accept the gift
Though humble he who gives.
Rich is the tribute of the grateful mind.
In the immortal words ol Bobbie Bums.
We've got to go.
- Yes. goodbye. Mamie.
ROBERT: You be careful, ladies.
Thank you. Be careful, it's quite a gale.
Say hello to your husbands.
And come back.
Hey, lass, what's the trouble?
The ladies are gone.
- That disgusting growth.
- Oh. 'tis nothing yet.
Wait till next time.
You'll scarce be able to see my face.
I will not kiss with a monkey.
But all the lumberjacks grow something on their faces.
I did not marry with a lumberjack.
Now myself.
I deem it a handsome addition.
O wad some Pow'! the giftie gie us
To see oursels as others see us!
In the immortal words ol Bobbie Bums.
Heh. Jo.
Aw. jo.
Jo, I have ached for you.
I have ached 10! you.
[WIND HOWLING]
Rob.
- Is it time to go?
- Aye. lass.
But I'll never make it to camp in this blizzard.
Then come back to bed.
The storm will keep you with me
10! a while.
Aye. lass. aye.
But it keeps me from my job too.
I het 10! you. Hob.
Oh? Why. jo?
Well. the ladies. they...
They tell me ol a danger... ol clashing trees and the ﬂying axes.
The rough and violent men.
Why, lass, the lumberjacks are only full of fun.
Oh. ol course. they may scrap a little.
Well. the ladies tell me that they thrive on fighting and brawling... and. Rob. I'm aware
ol your terrible temper.
- Your only fault.
- Thank you, lass.
If you could just learn not to use your fists.
I'll try. jo. I'll try. I'll do my best.
But that Irish... that Irish is just begging 10! trouble.
[BABY GURGLING]
[ROBERT GROANS]
What do you suppose he'll be?
Well. born in America... could be president.
Would you be liking that? Hm?
Yes.
But more I'd like him to be a good man.
Like his father.
Come now. lass. Lei': go to sleep.
[ROBERT SIGHS]
- Rob?
- Mm?
Now what?
Could I learn to lead?
[ROBERT SCOFFS]
What in Tophet for?
Well. I never thought on it in Fail Isle.
But here. most ol the ladies know how to lead.
Aye...
I'm not so sure it's a good idea
10! a female to know how to lead.
MAN:
Timber!
[LAUGHING]
NARRATOR: From then on, Mama and I were alone most of our first winter...
"because Mr. Cullen wouldn't give Papa time off.
[ROBERT WHISTLING]
You're aware. Nevsky.
That the wild game belongs to the company?
The company owns the timber.
Nothing else.
You calling me a liar?
- If the shoe fits.
- I ought to fire you for that.
MI. Cullen. you can do anything you like.
I'll swallow my gorge and my sell-respect until my belly's aching with it.
And what do you propose to do about it, Norsky?
That's... That's another thing.
Ale you figuring on fighting the boss?
Aye, if he's not too much of a coward to tangle with a Scot.
[LAUGHS]
You're talking to an Irishman.
[ROBERT PANTING]
[SIGHS]
And now, Irishman, if you'll be good enough... to instruct the paymaster to hand me my March wages...
I'll be turning my back on you.
[HUMBLING]
Well. the river's breaking up.
We'll be starting the log drive in a couple ol weeks.
Well. it's no concern ol mine.
I'll need a good jack on the sluice.
Well. I hope you find one.
You think you're man enough to handle the job?
You can say that to me while you're sitting there... with your tail wet in the snow?
[LAUGHS]
Maybe you don't know how dangerous the job is.
I've heard.
Of course, the company will bury you if you get killed.
Scotty.
Oh.
It's Scotty now.
You know. I think you saved the boss a trip to the dentist.
[LAUGHING]
[LAUGHS]
[BELL CLANGING]
That same spring,
Mrs. Pugmister rang her cowbell again...
and my brother Jimmie was born.
Named after Mama': brother James.
[BOTH LAUGHING]
Papa was very proud.
Since Papa': trade was boatbuilding...
Mama persuaded him to give up lugging and open his own boatyard...
with money borrowed from the Oshkosh Bank.
Oh.
Because she said logging was too dangerous.
Mrs. Pugmister rang he! cowbell again.
This time. for my brother Kirk.
Named after Mama': brother Kirk.
When I was 4 years old,
Mama and I started in school.
"Mr. Post and the Little Girl.
One cold night...“
That summer, Papa taught me how to help in the boatyard.
Stroke the blush with the grain.
Not against it.
That's it.
[WHISTLE BLOWING]
That's Mrs. Pugmister now, Papa.
Oh. no. Robbie. no.
She rings a bell.
Not 10! gills. she don't.
They named her Annabelle.
Mama had sisters also.
[WHISTLE BLOWING]
They named this one Elizabeth.
Now Mama': second sister was taken care of.
[WHISTLE BLOWING]
[FIDDLE PLAYING]
Now that we were getting to be a family,
Papa had to enlarge the cabin.
He even made a fiddle for Kirk, who couldn't fiddle too good.
Papa joked a lot and made us laugh.
It seemed like he was always there when he was needed.
Do not laugh at your sister.
Will you stop it?
That's my new sister. Jane.
Named after another of Mama's sisters, of course.
It was some time before Lizzie and Jane were old enough to go to church with us.
And Papa could hardly wait to show off the whole family.
It was about this time that my younger brother Jimmie...
began to have some very serious problems.
That's Mr. and' Mrs-Raider: and' their five girl's.
The twins had their eyes on Jimmie.
MAMIE:
Now careful, Annabelle, careful.
- There.
HO BERT: Careful.
Come along. Kirk.
Oh. Kirk. now look at you with your feet wet and a tickle in your throat already.
I should take him home and change his clothes.
You coddle him. He's got to learn to stand on his own feet like his brothels.
Children are not all ol one piece.
Come on.
Come along. Annabelle.
You stay away.
Jimmie. lad. we all know... that you're a brave fighting man like your father before you.
But it's hardly fitting 10! you to spar with gills.
But, Papa, they're always after me.
And one day. you'll find the good Lord had a purpose in that.
Hurry up, everybody's going in.
We'll be late.
- Now go on. away with you.
ROBERT: Come on.
Good morning. Herbert.
Good morning. Kirk.
- Good morning. how are you this morning?
- Good morning.
Good morning. Reverend.
- Nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.
Thank you.
- Good morning. Jimmie.
- Good morning.
Good morning. gills.
Good morning. Annabella.
And how is Jane?
I'm Jane.
Good morning.
Is there somewhere the other children could go?
I'll try to find a place.
- Why, doctor?
- What is it?
Diphtheria.
The others will have to go somewhere else.
They've been exposed... and they must be kept away from other children... until we know whether any ol them come down with it.
After they've gone, you put Kirk to bed.
Keep him warm.
Swab his throat every two hours.
And ii you notice any blackening in the throat, come for me at once.
I will. I will.
He must be quarantined.
Do you have a piece ol green cloth?
Will you try not to worry?
Kirk. you do what your mama says.
Diphtheria.
There. there. Now. lass.
Oh. Rob. what are we to do?
Well, in this weather, all that's needed is a roof to keep off the rain.
There's the Tylers' old homestead across in Indian land. I'll ask him.
- Papa. Jimmie and I saw...
MAMIE: Stand back.
Don't come any closer.
Find your brothels and sisters.
Wait outside.
Your father's taking you into the woods for a spell.
- Why?
ROBERT: Don't ask questions. Robbie.
Just do... Do what Mama says. Hm?
Away with you.
You mind Kirk.
I'm going to see to things.
Well. Kirk. you be a good boy.
And you do what Mama says. Hm?
Don't go away.
But, Kirk, you wouldn't want your brothers and sisters to sicken too now, would you?
I don't want you to go away.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll sand and varnish your fiddle while we're gone. Hm?
Don't go. Papa. Please. Papa.
Don't go. Papa. Please. Papa.
ROBERT:
Be careful, Annie.
MAMIE:
Wait, wait.
- Yes, Mamie?
- Here.
Oh. Mamie. don't worry. I will be fine.
The children will be fine.
- We'll take good care ol the children.
- Goodbye. Mama.
[ALL CHATTERING]
The children will be fine. Bye-bye.
[WOOD CRACKS.
ELIZABETH SCREAMS]
Oh. there. there. Here.
ANNABELLE: Janie.
- There.
There. Lizzie. darling.
Watch the hole. children.
Now don't cry. baby.
Papa will fix it in the morning.
ANNABELLE: Now. I'll be the mama.
And you be the papa.
And this is our baby.
Now you go out, and then you come in, and you sniff like this:
[ANNABELLE SNIFFS]
And. uh. then you say.
“What's in the stew tonight?“
Well. come on. Do it.
[ELIZABETH SNIFFS]
And I say.
“I haven't even thought about supper.
This baby has been so bad.“
Well, you come in, and then you sniff, and then you say it.
I wanna be the mama.
You can't be the mama.
You're shy.
[WATER SPLASHES]
You darn fool, I had a bite.
- Did not.
- I had to.
- No. you didn't.
- I did to.
[BOTH SHOUTING]
Boys. Jimmie. Hob.
Here. Boys.
Just stop it.
I'm surprised at you.
I'm surprised at both ol you.
Brawling, fighting like a couple of lrishers over nothing.
When your brother's so sick.
We don't know how he's getting along.
You should be ashamed ol yourselves.
Ashamed.
We were so busy enjoying our new surroundings...
we didn't realize haw worried Papa was.
[KIRK COUGHING]
Open up your mouth.
Open up your mouth 10! Mama.
[HARMONICA PLAYING]
JIMMIE:
I see a Chippewa.
ROBBIE:
You're crazy.
Nobody': seen an Indian around these parts in years.
Robbie. is Kirk gonna die?
Hush up. You want Papa to heal you?
Papa.
Aye.
Nothing bad could happen, could it?
To Kirk. I mean.
Pesky mosquitoes.
Could ii. Papa?
Oh. Robbie. you're only a lad.
You stay that way yet a while.
Let Papa do the worrying.
I want to know. Papa.
Come here. Hob.
That's a sign you're glowing up.
But you see.
It isn't given anybody to know the future.
You hope and you play 10! guidance... and. uh. you do what you can within your powers... because if you don't...
It you don't and the worst happens to somebody that you love... well, then a man cannot live with himself.
When I glow up. Papa.
I want to be just like you.
I've dried the dishes.
Oh. Annabelle.
And it is proud I am ol you
10! being such a good helper.
Now you go fetch your slate.
It's time 10! your ABC's.
Oh. do I have to?
You know. your mama sets great stole by a gill learning how to lead.
You got the slate, Annabelle?
[ROBERT SIGHS]
Now. Annabelle.
What is that?
- Aye. Annabelle.
Thank you. Jim.
And now. darling. tell your papa.
What is that?
“B." Papa.
It is proud ol you I am.
Now. darling. tell your old papa.
What is that?
"C-"
Don't laugh at your sister.
That it looks like a C for a fact.
MAMIE:
Rob.
What's that?
- No. darling.
Listen.
MAMIE:
Rob.
- Rob.
- It's Mama.
You stay here. All ol you.
Oh. Mamie.
Rob.
You show me your face, jo.
Then the lad's all light?
He passed the crisis last night.
And the others?
Have you been watching
10! any sign oi anything?
Oh. they're fine. Just fine.
And the baby?
The baby?
The baby needs you, jo.
We all need you.
DI. Delbert said that you can come home on Saturday.
Saturday.
Kirk's fine.
Then nothing bad': gonna happen.
The lad's getting well.
I'll tell them.
[SOBBING]
That was the only time
I ever saw Papa cry.
Here you are. Kirk.
Now you drink this up like a good boy.
[KIDS SHOUTING]
Mama.
- Mama.
- Mama. Mama.
Hiya. Kirk.
Look at you.
ANNABELLE: Oh, golly, you know,
I saw a wolf. A real live wolf.
You did not. It was a fox.
It was a wolf.
- I saw a wolf.
ROBBIE: Did you have a temperature?
- I did see a wolf.
KIRK: Yeah, 104.
JIMMIE:
You did not.
We went to a big house.
Ale you not speaking to me?
How could you let the children get so dirty?
Mamie, don't be at me, I'm tired.
Don't talk to me about being tiled.
JIMMIE: Yes. it was.
ROBBIE: No. it wasn't.
JIMMIE: I saw a Chippewa.
A real live Chippewa brave.
ANNABELLE: He didn't. Jimmie should have his mouth washed out with soap.
MAMIE:
I'm gonna scour his outside first.
Oh, Lizzie, look at your hair.
How could your father let you get like that?
He did the best he could.
He was awful worried.
Here. Robbie.
You get the tangles out.
ROBBIE:
Yes. ma'am.
[ROBERT COUGHING]
Rob. Is that...?
- Rob.
- Oh.
Open up your mouth.
No. Mamie. Go away.
Open up your mouth.
- Mama. I can't get all the tangles...
- Robbie. go 'fetch DI. Delbert.
Quick.
- Rob.
- Mm?
Do you remember when...
When you were on the expedition... searching for Franklin up at the North Pole?
Aye.
Well. I didn't tell you at the time...
"because I thought you'd be mad at sister Annabelle.
Those three years you were away and no wold... she was after me to wed with Gower MacDerrnott.
Do you remember him with the curly red beard?
No.
Everyone thought that you were as dead as Franklin.
But I knew you'd come back.
Oh.
[ROBERT COUGHS]
Then...
Then why did you go into mourning?
Oh. it came to me... that it wouldn't be fitting for any man, not even the rich Gower MacDerrnott... to court a maid when she was in mourning 10! he! late intended.
[ROBERT CHUCKLES. COUGHS]
Wasn't that canny ol me. Hob?
Canny.
I've often thought on it.
If I'd listened to them and married him...
Robbie and the rest of the children, they would have taken after Gower... and I would not like that.
Oh. Mamie.
Nor I.
Just think on it. Hob.
Not since the children joined us have we been alone like this.
[MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] and let thy mercy endure forever.
Thankful for the life which though hast given us these seasons... we play thy help now to resign it obediently unto thee.
Amen.
We, therefore, commit his body to the ground.
Earth to earth.
Ashes to ashes. dust to dust.
Looking for the general resurrection on the last day... and the life of the world to come, through our Lord Jesus Christ.
Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from henceforth.
“Yea." said the spirit... that they may rest from their labors and their works do follow them.
God. have mercy upon us.
Amen.
You come here. Lizzie.
You're going to be the papa.
ELIZABETH:
I won't, I won't, I won't.
ANNABELLE:
Yes. you will.
- Can't you control your young ones?
- I'll be mama and you papa.
Play outside. bonnie lambs.
Not unless I can be the mama.
- Let he! be the mama. Annie.
- Oh...
- See?
- Come on. Lizzie.
Now see? You got Mama all upset.
Now you come outside.
And I'll tell you what to do.
[MAMIE SIGHS]
I'm sorry. Mrs. Runyon.
I'm so used to children.
You ought to set your cap
10! some nice old bachelor.
Thank you. Mrs. Runyon.
No. I'll not many again.
Well. then why don't you return to your kin in Scotland?
Money 10! the passage doesn't glow on trees.
Well. perhaps I could take up a collection lo! you.
Tum. please.
Now your eldest is a strong boy.
Put him out 10! the day.
He's been sweeping at the sawmills all summer.
But his school starts next week.
Book learning is a luxury your offspring can ill afford.
And it's time somebody talked turkey to you.
Mrs. Runyon.
When I need your advice. I'll ask 10! it.
Get me out ol this.
ANNABELLE: He's coming. he's coming.
JIMMIE: Where?
ANNABELLE:
Shh.
Is everybody ready?
- Ale you ready?
- Yeah. Okay.
[KIDS GIGGLE]
ANNABELLE:

ALL:
Surprise. Surprise. Surprise.
[ALL SINGING “AULD LANG SYNE"]
KIDS:
Surprise.
ANNABELLE:
Here's your present.
Did you make them. Annie?
Of course, she didn't make them.
Annie helped.
Gee, Mama, they fit perfect.
Come on. Robbie. Cut your cake.
Wait just a second.
I gotta tell Mama something.
You know what MI. Cullen gave me
10! the horse?
Forty dollars.
That's fine. Robbie.
But that isn't all.
He gave me a job 10! this winter.
Indeed. you have a job 10! this winter.
To finish 6th grade.
I told him you'd say that.
So he's letting me work just Saturdays and Sundays.
Know what he's gonna pay me?
Fifty cents.
- For doing what?
- Being coffee boy.
Now don't you start getting a notion about being a logger.
Papa was a logger.
What's the matter with being a logger?
I won't have you wandering through the woods... with the clashing trees and the bitter cold.
ROBBIE: But me and MI. Cullen shook on it.
And he gave me 50 cents in advance.
MAMIE:
Well. you'll have to give it back.
ROBBIE:
You can't give back a handshake.
MAMIE:
From your father.
Put it on.
KIRK: Robbie.
Aren't you ever gonna cut your cake?
The popcorn's getting cold.
Mama. will you think on it?
- Hi.
- Hi.
JIMMIE:
You know what she was gonna do?
She said she was gonna take a steamboat to Oshkosh.
ROBBIE:
Whoa. whoa. whoa.
One at a time. Here.
- Where’s Mama?
- Up to Mrs. Raiden's.
She finished the Christmas dresses
10! those gills.
Hey. you wanna know what happened to me in the woods today?
- What happened. Robbie?
- Yeah. tell us.
- I met a bear.
- A bear?
[ANNABELLE GASPS]
- Did he growl at you?
- What happened?
I'm walking down the trail lugging the coffee and cups... and suddenly. there he is.
- What did he do?
- Well. he looked at me and I looked at him.
Then I guess.
He heard the tin cups rattling together.
But I just looked him in the eye.
Suddenly, he turned and ran off into the woods.
Oh. Robbie. weren't you scaled?
Of course, I wasn't scared.
Then what were you shaking 101?
Who said anything about shaking?
You said the cups were rattling and you were standing still... so you must have been shaking.
[DOOR OPENS]
ANNABELLE:
Oh. Mama.
Robbie met a bear in the woods and was scaled to death.
MAMIE: Shame on you, Robbie, telling tales to frighten the children.
JIMMIE:
But he did. Mama.
- Is that true, Robbie?
- Yes, Mama.
Then you don't go back into the woods with the wild animals prowling.
But you depend on me.
I've told you. you don't go back up there.
Not so long as I'm alive.
I'm gonna lie down 10! a spell.
Is Mama sick or something?
[MAMIE SOBBING]
I can't...
I know he'll come back.
No.
I tell you. sister Annabelle...
Robert will come back.
Come back.
ROBBIE:
DI. Delbert.
DI. Delbert. DI. Delbert.
Your mama is a sick woman.
A very sick woman.
You mean, she might not get well?
Well. it's typhoid.
Typhoid fever?
Your mama's not as strong as she was.
You'd better get Mrs. Pugmister to take over.
She's away until after New Year's.
[DELBERT SIGHS]
You ought to have somebody.
We'll be all right.
I'll stay home from school.
Your mama probably won't like that... but I'll get Mrs. Delbert to look in every little while.
One of you boys come running if there's any change.
What are you standing around 101?
Get to bed.
You're not the boss around here.
[ORGAN PLAYING “DECK THE HALLS"]
What do you want?
GIRL 1:
Jimmie. we think you're cute.
Ah. shut up.
GIRL 2: We think you're the prettiest wise man of all.
Come along, girls.
Hurry back to your seats.
We're ready to start.
MAN:
This way.
Come over here. And you here.
That's it.
Where's my frankincense?
- Oh. no.
WOMAN: Here it is.
- Oh, yes.
- Here you are, Howie.
Where's Joseph?
BOY:
Here I am.
Hob?
Is that you. Hob?
No. Mama. It's me. Robbie.
Where are the children?
Jimmie and Kirk are being wise men.
I want to see them.
Now. Mama?
I've... I've got to see them all.
ROBBIE:
Annabelle.
Go and get Jimmie and Kirk. quick.
[ORGAN PLAYING

Hello. Mama.

Hello. Mama.
ROBBIE:
We're all here. Mama.
James.
Kirk.
Annabelle.
Lizzie.
How nice ol my brothels and sisters... to come and visit me... all the way from Fair Isle.
But, Kirk, you" You didn't write.
You could. you know.
I can lead now.
Well, you're all named after family.
Now go on. get out.
Mama don't wanna be bothered.
[SOBBING]
MAMIE:
Robbie.
Yes. Mama?
Come here.
I'm ﬂighty.
Not now. you're not.
I know they're my children.
And they're bonnie. aren't they?
Yes. Mama.
Anybody would want them.
What are you talking about?
Your brothels and sisters have to have homes.
Good homes where they're wanted and loved.
Janie's such a wee one still.
I'll take care ol them. Mama.
I promise.
It's too big a job lo! such a small lad.
But you know what your brothels and sisters are like.
I want you to decide where they're to be offered.
Don't talk like that, Mama.
Place them with families that have children of their own... so that they won't be so lonesome to! each other.
Robbie...
I don't know what I would have done without you.
You've truly been a man ol the house.
And...
Find a good place for yourself.
Don't worry about me.
[BELL TOLLING]
Well. DI. Delbert. what are we gonna do about these orphans?
Mrs. Runyon, have you no feeling?
I suggest you call an emergency meeting ol the council.
And the sooner the better, DI. Delbert.
Mrs. Runyon. there is a time and place.
But this is neither.
Robbie.
She shouldn't have said that light now... but, of course, we are going to have to find a place for you.
Mama said I was to decide where we were to go.
- You. Robbie?
- Yes. sir.
I'm... I'm head ol the family now.
But...
But you're only 12.
Why don't you come to see us this afternoon?
Maybe by then. we'll have a plan.
But tomorrow's Christmas.
Can't us kids stay together just to! Christmas?
Well. I don't know.
You children all alone in that house at night.
Probably be our last chance to be together on Christmas.
So can't we make up our minds day after tomorrow?
That's not too much to ask. is it?
No. Jimmie.
I don't think it is.
ROBBIE: A wink of his eye and a twist of his head
Soon gave me to know
I had nothing to dread
He spoke not a word,
But went straight to his work
And filled all the stockings,
Then turned with a jerk
And laying his finger aside of his nose
And giving a nod. up the chimney he rose
He sprang to his sleigh,
To the team gave a whistle
And away they all ﬂew
Like the down of a thistle
But I heard him exclaim
As they drove out of sight
Happy Christmas to all
To all a good night
Jane's asleep.
- I'll go get the slate. Shh.
- What 101?
Take he! to bed.
What you gonna do?
Make a list of families that like kids.
What about the Tylers?
They're well-fixed.
The Tylers? For whom?
Annabelle.
All they've got': Howie and Bruce.
They might like a gill to help Mrs. Tyler.
Well. maybe.
But it don't cut no ice what we think.
Mama said I was to decide.
And if I don't quick, we'll all end up in the state home, orphans.
That's what we are. aren't we?
No. and we never will be.
Well. anyway. they won't let you decide.
Not if I wait till day after tomorrow.
And tomorrow's the best day
10! me to do what Mama told me.
But tomorrow's Christmas.
That's just it.
On Christmas. we ought to get just about anybody we want to take any ol us in. See?
MR. TYLER: What we ale about to receive this Christmas Day... may the Lord make us truly thankful.
[MR. TYLER CLEARS THROAT]
- Amen.
HOWIE: Amen.
BRUCE: Amen.
KATIE: Amen.
Papa. I want the drumstick. remember?
BRUCE:
Me too.
Now, hold your horses or you'll get the part that went over the fence last.
Oh. I 'feel so bad about the Eunson children.
They're probably having dinner with the Delberts or Bradleys.
Well. we should have made sure.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
Wonder who that would be.
Folks should be at home enjoying Christmas dinner this time of day.
Papa, what's frankincense?
It's what one ol the wise men took to the baby Jesus.
I know that.
I took it to him. but what is it?
Look who I found.
Robbie Eunson.
And Annabelle.
You'll have Christmas dinner with us.
And don't argue. We won't take no.
We certainly will not.
Begging your pardon, Mrs. Tyler.
Yes?
Jimmie and I was wondering ii you... ll you didn't need a...
Well. a sort ol sister 10! Howie and Bruce.
But I'm your sister. Robbie.
I know you are. Annie.
But you could be their sister too.
Annie's a good girl, and she'd be an awful help to you.
She“
She was learning to sew.
And she can wipe dishes... and she knows he! ABC's.

I don't know. MI. Tyler.
Sure, Mr. Tyler. She'll like it a lot.
She likes anybody that's good to her.
We'll be good to her. Robbie.
I guess you and I know each other.
I know you. MI. Tyler.
For what we have just received, may the Lord make us truly thankful.
Robbie, we were just talking about you.
Come in.
Well. no. thanks. DI. Delbert.
I just brought you old Molly.
- Old Molly?
- Yes. sir.
Well, uh, I don't quite understand.
Why would you bring me your cow?
To pay the debt.
For Kirk. and Papa and Mama.
That isn't your debt, boy.
Mama would want me to pay.
I'd be much obliged if you'll take old Molly.
Adam. who is it? Oh.
Hello. Robbie.
Robbie. Mrs. Delbert and I would be happy to take one ol you children.
Well. DI. Delbert, I appreciate it.
But with both your gills married and Millie with a baby and all...
I see. Robbie.
That makes us grandparents, doesn't it?
It's a little late to start a new family, is that it?
You know Mama and Papa thought the world of you both, but...
Robbie. you've got a head on your shoulders.
You place the children where you think tit.
And you'll take old Molly?
I'll take old Molly.
ROBBIE:
Jimmie.
What's the matter?
Wouldn't the Potters take her?
They weren't home.
I thought folks would be home on Christmas.
What are we gonna do?
We can't keep he! out much longer.
She's getting blue.
There's the Fischers. What about them?
I'm surprised at you. James Eunson.
You know how Mama felt about saloons.
[ELIZABETH SOBBING]
Why. you hush. Lizzie.
We're doing everything we can to get lid oi you.
[SLEIGH BELLS RINGING]
What do you think?
But the Stephens don't have any kids of their own.
Yeah, I know, but you know how Mama felt about book learning and all.
But what ii Lizzie grew up to be a schoolteacher?
Well. light now. she's homely enough.
Well. maybe it's the best we can do.
Now. you be a good gill, Lizzie.
MR. STEPHENS:
Whoa.
Well, Robert, Mrs. Stephens and I have just been to your house.
We thought there might be something we could do.
Well...
Well. there is. if...
Well. speak up. son. speak up.
I'm not quite the monster you think me in the classroom.
Well. I was wondering ii you'd like to take Elizabeth.
- That's her.
- That is she.
Take her?
Well. sort ol adopt her.
She doesn't look very pretty light now.
But you'll learn to like her.
Mama and Papa did.
Mama never had any favorites... but if she had, I guess Elizabeth would have been the one.
- She wasn't her favorite.
- Shh!
You wouldn't care to shoulder this responsibility. would you. Glace?
Wouldn't I just.
Look. Flank.
He! eyes are just like yours.
Now. you boys come and see us whenever you can. huh?
Yes. ma'am.
[MH. STEPHENS CLICKS TONGUE]
Her eyes aren't like that old schoolteacher's.
Of course not.
They're like Papa's.
Gee.
She didn't even wave goodbye.
Kids forget awful fast.
Yeah.
RUNYON:
Now you stay out ol here.
Robbie. Jimmie.
Mrs. Runyon's inside.
Says she's gonna take Jane.
Runyon?
Yes. says it's he! Christian duty.
She's putting he! things on.
What are we gonna do?
Tell he! she's already promised to the Ellises.
She knows them. She'd ask them.
Well. what are we gonna do. Robbie?
I don't know.
Well?
You can't have Jane. Mrs. Runyon.
She... She's already promised.
She is? To whom?
You don't know them.
I know everybody in Eureka.
Well, these folks, they don't live in Eureka.
They... They're...
- Up to Berlin.
- That's light, up to Berlin.
I don't believe you.
By whose authority are you children being disposed oi?
Mama said I was to decide.
You?
Well. I'll see about this.
I'll call an emergency meeting ol the council.
And I'll be back.
You take Kirk over to Mr. and Mrs. Cramer.
But we had the Gustafsons wrote down for Kirk.
But they live way up country.
And we only got a short time.
What's that got to do with the price of eggs?
Don't you see? I can't start off with Janie until we get Kirk placed.
JIMMIE: But the Cramers, they don't have no kids neither.
ROBBIE: But Mrs. Cramer's got the only real piano in town.
Tell he! Kirk can fiddle pretty good.
But I don't wanna go.
I want to stay with you.
You can't Kirk.
Nobody': gonna stay here anymore.
But I don't wanna go.
And get a move on. Don't be a crybaby.
I don't wanna go. Robbie.
Who do you think you are?
Annie didn't cry. and Lizzie didn't cry.
You're 10 years old. Kirk.
Don't you cause no trouble.
Stand on your own two feet.
I don't wanna go. Robbie.
Go on. get out.
Get out.
Go on.
Go on.
[SOBBING]
Did the Cramers take Kirk?
Yeah.
You didn't see old Runyon. did you?
What you gonna do with Janie?
Take he! up to Berlin.
But I just said that.
Berlin's 10 miles.
I'll pull he! up by sled and bring it back to you sometime.
You gonna stay up there?
Yeah.
I'm gonna work at Cullen's logging camp.
And not go to school no more?
- Mm-mm.
- Lucky.
You can keep the sled.
The sled and my skates 10! your led sled.
Fail enough?
Fail enough.
You talked to the Raidens?
No. but I don't have to.
They'll take me.
Mrs. Raiden's always lollygagging about how she wished she had a boy like me.
Well. she got he! wish.
I'll go get the sled.
You better get a move on. or first thing you know. old Runyon will get you.
You like them all right, don't you?
Like who?
The Raidens.
I like them all light.
Then what's eating you?
All those gills.
I can just heal them:
“This is our new brothel, Jimmie.
Ain't he cute?“
Well. ain't you?
Give up?
Give up. Let me go.
Not till you say you're cute.
I'm cute.
Say it again.
All right, I'm cute.
[BOTH LAUGH]
I'm sorry I popped you one. Robbie.
I had it coming to me.
But you ought to watch your temper.
Jimmie.
Yeah. I got a terrible temper.
You gonna sell it?
ROBBIE:
Not light away.
You go first.
You'll come down once in a while?
Sure. every chance I get.
And don't start wearing dresses with all those gills around.
You shut up.
[FOOTSTEPS]
[KIDS LAUGH]
[LAUGHTER]
[BELL JINGLING]
Well. 10! mercy': sake.
Please, ma'am. I was wondering if you'd care to have my sister.
You're sure you'll be all light?
Yes. ma'am. I'll be fine.
Well, don't worry about your baby sister.
We'll take care ol her.
Thank you. ma'am.
You come see he! sometime.
Yes. ma'am.
[ENGLISH SDH]
Good morning, schoolmaster.
See the kite?
Tell us a story!
Wait for me, Hans! Please wait.
Well, hurry up. Faster!
Thank you.
Next time, don't be late.
Now, yesterday, Matilda was the wicked mermaid - the princess of the frozen sea.
- Remember that?
- Yes.
Today, as I promised - we always keep our promises, don't we?
Yes!
- Today, as I promised, she will be the...
- Queen of China!
Did anybody remember to bring a dress for the queen of China?
You said you would!
All right.
Please, ladies and gentlemen.
If we can't have a queen, then we'll have a king.
It's very simple. We just take the crown and put it over on the side.
He was a very jaunty little king - wore his crown like that. Now, we'll just...
Ah... No peeping.
There we are.
Long live the king!
Long live the king!
That's not a king.
It's only a queen with a moustache.
Well, a lot of kings are only a queen with a moustache.
- We all believe it's a king, don't we?
- Yes!
Since we have no clothes for the king, this is a story about a king who had no clothes, and about a little boy who only believed what he saw.
That's you!
Well, one day, two swindlers came to see the king to sell him what they said was a magic suit of clothes.
Now, the king was very fond of new clothes, so he said, "Let me see it."
But there wasn't any suit of clothes.
The swindlers held up their hands like this and said,
"Your Majesty, this is a magic suit.
"You, being very wise and intelligent, can see how beautiful it is,
"but to a fool, it is absolutely invisible."
Well, he said, "I see."
Not wanting to appear a fool, he added,
"Yes, indeed. I see it perfectly.
"It's beautiful.
"Isn't it grand? Isn't it fine?
Look at the cut, the style, the line!
"The suit of clothes is altogether but altogether, it's altogether
"The most remarkable suit of clothes that I have ever seen
"These eyes of mine at once determine the sleeves are velvet, the cape is ermine
"The hose are blue and the doublet is a lovely shade of green!"
A lovely shade of green!
"Somebody send for the queen!"
The queen came and she was told how all the wise people could see the...
- Magic suit!
- That's right.
Naturally, not wanting to appear a fool, she said,
"Oh! Isn't it grand?
"Isn't it rich?
Look at the charm of every stitch!
"The suit of clothes is altogether, it's altogether
"The most remarkable suit of clothes that I have ever seen
"These eyes of mine at once determine the sleeves are velvet, the cape is ermine
"The hose are blue and the doublet is a lovely shade of green!"
- A lovely shade of green!
- "Summon the court to convene!"
All the court came, the ministers and ambassadors came.
Not wanting to seem like fools, they agreed with the...
- King and queen.
- The king issued a proclamation.
The suit of clothes is altogether but altogether, it's altogether
The most remarkable suit of clothes a tailor ever made
Now quickly put it altogether with gloves of leather and hat and feather
It's altogether the thing to wear at Saturday's parade
- Saturday's parade!
- Leading the royal brigade!
By this time, everybody had heard about the king's new clothes that he would wear at the parade.
The people lined the streets as the artillery came by, the infantry came by, and the cavalry came by and the fife and drum corps and the royal guard, and finally the king.
Everybody cheered "Hurray"...
...because nobody wanted to appear a fool.
Nobody that is except one little boy who, for some strange reason, hadn't heard about the king's new magic suit, and didn't know what he was supposed to see.
He took one look at the king, turned a little pale and said,
"Look at the king! Look at the king!
"The king is in the altogether, but altogether, the altogether
"He's altogether as naked as the day that he was born
"The king is in the altogether, but altogether, the altogether
"It's altogether the very least the king has ever worn
"Call the court physician, call an intermission
"His majesty is wide open to ridicule and scorn
"The king is in the altogether, but altogether, the altogether
"He's altogether as naked as the day that he was born
"And it's altogether too chilly a morn!"
- Hans!
- Hurry, Peter.
We're going to hear another story.
Hans, the schoolmaster went to the Burgomaster and the...
Peter, don't worry so much on a beautiful day like this.
They're coming here - the schoolmaster, the Burgomaster, the council. Look!
Good morning, Burgomaster.
Look, Burgomaster.
The books - on the dirty ground!
Here. The History of Denmark used to tie the string of a dirty kite!
The history of any country can always stand a little fresh air.
Did you hear about the history book that took a vacation and came back a much better history?
You see? That's the stuff he fills the children's heads with!
Look at this.
"Arithmetic. A two met a four one day.
"They liked each other immediately and got married,
"and all the other numbers came to their wedding."
- It's impossible!
- There are different ways of learning.
A cobbler belongs in his shop, and children belong in school.
- Tend to your shoes. I'll tend to my school!
- To be sure.
But is the world made up of nothing else but shoes and schoolrooms, and...?
There's a story of a piece of chalk and a blackboard.
The piece of chalk had written so many things on the blackboard that it believed it knew all about everything.
The blackboard was angry.
She felt that without her to write upon, nobody would know anything, and she was the one who really knew it all.
One day, quite by accident, the schoolmaster broke the piece of chalk and tossed it out of the window.
It fell beside a pencil that the piece of chalk had always admired.
A pencil to a piece of chalk is something very special.
- And what do you suppose happened?
- What happened?
What is this? Have we all lost our senses?
Are you going listen to him with the children? What is this?
That will be enough, Hans.
Children, pick up your schoolbooks and go back to school. Hurry now.
Follow the schoolmaster.
Not another word from anyone.
I advise you, Hans, to stay in your shop from now on. Come, gentlemen.
Stop shaking your head at me like an old woman, Peter.
- I can feel it in the back of my neck.
- Hans, turn around. I've got to talk to you.
Did you ever hear the story of the old woman who shook her head at the family so much that it fell off, right on the table?
Hans, why do you keep on making trouble for us?
Trouble? There's no trouble that a good story can't get us out of - like the one just now about the piece of chalk and the blackboard.
I didn't know what I was going to say until after I'd said it.
In fact, I'd like to know how the story ends myself.
Please stay in the shop. Don't tell the children stories all the time.
I never saw such a worrier like you, Peter.
You want to really worry about something? Here's something.
Two years ago, I took you out of the orphanage and promised them I'd make you into a good cobbler. Two whole years.
Look at that shoe - glue all smeared and nails in crooked.
Two years an apprentice, and still the nails go in crooked.
I'm not that bad, am I? You're not going to send me back to the orphanage, are you?
Aha! A new worry appears in the sky.
Never mind, Peter. Let's go home.
Two and two are four
Four and four are eight
Eight and eight are sixteen
Sixteen and sixteen are thirty-two
Two and two are four
Four and four are eight
Eight and eight are sixteen
Sixteen and sixteen are thirty-two...
An inchworm. The first one of the year!
Four and four are eight
Eight and eight are sixteen
Sixteen and sixteen are thirty-two...
Inchworm
Inchworm
Measuring the marigolds
You and your arithmetic
You'll probably go far
Inchworm
Inchworm
Measuring the marigolds
Seems to me
You stop and see
How beautiful they are
Two and two are four
Four and four are eight
Eight and eight are sixteen
Sixteen and sixteen are thirty-two
Good morning, schoolmaster.
Oh, Hans.
- Let me explain...
- Out of my way!
I am talking sense, and that is exactly what I want.
Either Hans Christian Andersen leaves this town or I do.
Surely, schoolmaster, a little story now and then - not during school hours.
It is not just now and then, it is all the time.
When they are late, he gives them excuses.
"The snow queen took me to see the king of the mountain!"
That is true.
I asked my Gerda what time it was.
She said the minute hand and the hour hand were not speaking to each other.
They were both in love with the second hand.
They wouldn't meet till 12 o'clock, and no one could tell the time until then.
- I like that.
- Like it?
We pay our taxes for the school, not for
Hans to fill their heads with foolishness.
But Hans's stories are good.
The children learn from them.
- They are not foolish stories.
- I would like to know now.
I would like to pack up tonight.
Tomorrow, you'll be looking for a new cobbler or a new teacher.
Gentlemen...
It is decided. The cobbler must leave.
- But...
- Quiet!
I'll tell Hans myself. It will not be pleasant, but I see it has to be done.
Perhaps it's all for the best.
Tell Hans to wait in the shop for me.
I'll talk to him before supper.
Come, gentlemen.
- Hello, Hans.
- Hello, Peter.
- Was it nice by the river?
- Just perfect.
Did we have any customers today?
Not one. It just gets slower and slower.
Don't you think we should go to a larger city where shoes wear out faster?
And be stuck in the shop all day?
No, sir. I like business to be a little slow.
There's time enough for everything here.
That's what I mean, Hans. No shoes wear out. No one ever leaves.
Not one person in this village has ever been to Copenhagen, have they?
That's true, but why should they?
I never think about Copenhagen - do you?
Do I? What do you suppose
Copenhagen is really like?
It's a funny thing, now that you mention it.
I used to think about Copenhagen a lot.
I used to make up the most wonderful stories about going there.
I used to think about Copenhagen a lot when I was your age.
My husband says the shoes hurt.
- They squeak and the left one doesn't fit.
- That's all? That's not too bad, Mrs Burda.
I sometimes think that shoes have a life of their own.
The ones that squeak don't like to leave the shop, and the ones that hurt don't like whoever's wearing them.
Please, Hans, just fix the shoes.
I've got my own life to worry about.
When Mr Burda's feet hurt, he drives the whole house crazy.
Hans, tell me. What kind of stories did you make up about Copenhagen?
Oh... I used to dream about having the finest cobbler shop in Copenhagen.
I wasn't just an ordinary cobbler.
I only saw people by appointment.
First I looked at them before I even looked at their shoes, and if I didn't like them, no shoes.
Do you know that peop...?
Where are you going?
Don't you want to hear the rest of it?
- What's that?
- Your bag. It's all packed, Hans.
- My bag?
- Go to Copenhagen now. Right now.
Are you crazy, Peter?
That was a story I was telling.
Didn't you understand that?
Of course I understood, but part of it must be like you imagined, and maybe even great carriages with fine horses, beautiful houses three storeys high.
Don't you want to see it for yourself? It's not so far from here - your bag's packed.
All you have to do is walk out of that door.
Quick! Before you change your mind.
Before I change my mind? Who said
I was going? Just like that, this afternoon?
What's got into you, Peter, anyway?
You forgot about Copenhagen all these years.
You may forget about it again until you're too old to go.
No, some day I'm really going to Copenhagen.
- That's the one thing I'm sure of.
- Who knows?
Has anyone from this village gone to Copenhagen before? Of course not.
They keep putting it off.
Imagine, Hans, you'll be the first.
What a to-do there'll be tomorrow.
They'll talk of nothing else for days.
"Hans has gone to Copenhagen!"
"Hans has gone to Copenhagen."
Yes!
What a sign it would make! "Hans
Christian Andersen, gone to Copenhagen" with little shoes pointing the way out of town!
I'll make the sign tonight. I see it exactly as you do - the little shoes, everything!
Goodbye, Hans. Aren't you excited?
Excited? You mean
I really should go, Peter?
Why not? It's only a few days away.
You stay a little while and then come back, but you've been to Copenhagen.
But it's a big step, Peter.
Still, what's to stop me?
My goodness, I am getting excited!
Hans!
If anyone had told me this morning that I'd decide to go to Copenhagen...
- Start walking!
- Imagine, Peter.
I've decided to go to Copenhagen, just like I made it up in a story.
- Goodbye, Hans.
- Goodbye, Peter.
Goodbye, Peter, and take care of yourself.
I'll only be gone a few days.
- Tell the children goodbye for me.
- I will.
Imagine, Peter - Copenhagen!
Goodbye, Peter.
Hello.
Oh, my goodness. My feet hurt.
I cannot understand why these shoes hurt me so.
I made them myself. You're lucky.
You don't have to wear shoes.
I can never understand why people use that expression "A dog's life".
Every dog I ever knew seemed to have a very nice life indeed.
You've no idea, and maybe it's just as good you don't.
Back in the village, if people saw me talking to you like this, do you know what would happen?
Every head would shake for a week, and yet how pleasant this is!
I can say anything I want to, and there's no sound except the wag of your tail.
And people do the strangest things, too.
Oh, yes, my friend.
Even me. Myself included.
For instance, if you were to ask me what I was doing on the road to Copenhagen, do you know something?
I couldn't tell you.
I was trying to figure it out a little while ago - what Peter said, what I said.
All of a sudden, I find myself on the road to Copenhagen.
Do you know something else, my friend?
I'm a little bit frightened.
Copenhagen is a very big place.
Still, what can happen, huh?
People are nice.
That's the nice thing about the world, my friend - people.
So, what can happen?
I'll walk through the gates of the city, go up to someone and say,
"How do you do?
I'm Hans Christian Andersen."
I'll walk through the gates of the city, and
I'll say, "I'm Hans Christian Andersen".
I'm Hans Christian Andersen
I've many a tale to tell
And though I'm a cobbler,
I'd say I tell them rather well
I'll mend your shoes and I'll fix your boots when I have a moment free
When I'm not otherwise occupied
As a purple duck or a mountain side or a quarter after three
I'm Hans Christian Andersen, that's me!
I'm Hans Christian Andersen and this is an April day
It's full of the magic I need to speed me on my way
My pocketbook has an empty look
I limp on a lumpy shoe
So I turn into a flying fish
Or a millionaire with a rocking chair and a dumpling in my stew
I'm Hans Christian Andersen
Andersen, that's who!
Hans!
Hans!
Peter!
Peter, what are you doing here?
What's this? You've got the whole shop on wheels.
Copenhagen sounded so wonderful, Hans,
I got to thinking maybe you wouldn't come back for a while.
Maybe for a long while, so I thought maybe you'd need the shop.
Peter, sometimes I think you put ideas into my head that aren't even there.
Me? Oh, no, Hans.
I'm not at all sure I shouldn't send you back right now.
- But, Hans...
- Still...
...as long as you've come this far...
I sail up the Skagerrak
And sail down the Kattegatt
Through the harbour and up to the quay
And there she stands
Waiting for me
With a welcome so warm and so gay
Wonderful, wonderful Copenhagen
Friendly old girl of a town
'Neath her tavern light
On this merry night
Let us clink and drink one down
To wonderful, wonderful Copenhagen
Salty old queen of the sea
Once I sailed away
But I'm home today
Singing Copenhagen
Wonderful, wonderful Copenhagen for me!
There she is!
Wonderful, wonderful Copenhagen
Friendly old girl of a town

- Thank you.
Hans, why don't we set up shop here?
Here? Well, what are we waiting for?
I'm Hans Christian Andersen, the pride of the cobbler's trade
Permit me to show you a great discovery I've made
A shoe goes squeak and a shoe goes squawk, a squeak-iddy-squawk all day
Though you'd figure a shoe can't talk, if you listen close to the squeak and squawk
You can plainly hear it say
"Let Hans Christian Andersen fix me right away!"
In Hans Christian Andersen your feet have a loyal friend
The sort of a doctor, I'm sure, your toes would recommend
I work all night if a shoe's too tight to see where the pinch comes from
I raise my hammer and shut one eye and I sometimes hit on the reason why
And I sometimes hit my thumb. Oh!
- What's your name?
- I'm Hans Christian Andersen!
- You're under arrest.
- Under arrest?
Disrespect for the King's statue.
Get that boy!
Run, Peter! Run!
Do you want the new ballet ready for the tour, Otto? Then do as I say - now!
- You heard what we said.
- Niels, be sensible.
All right, don't do it. Stand here and argue.
I'll get a cobbler while you go and teach them the ballet.
Why is it a matter of life and death to have a cobbler right now?
Because you have a ballerina who is so pig-headed that I must make an example of her in front of the entire company.
That's awful perfume.
- Sir, I know where...
- Go away!
She won't get away with this.
I know her far better than you do.
- Very well. You know her...
- Otto, the ballet is only half finished.
No cobbler, no ballet. I guarantee it, Otto!
- I know where you can get a cobbler, sir.
- What's that?
I said I know where you can get a cobbler, sir.
Where?
- You'll have to use a little influence.
- Influence?
With the police. We should hurry, sir.
I know where one is sitting right now!
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello!
- Hello!
Are you all alone in there?
Well, in a way, yes.
- Are you scared?
- Hmm?
- Are you scared?
- Scared? No.
Nobody's ever really alone.
Did you know that?
As a matter of fact,
I'm expecting company right now.
Would you like me to introduce you?
Are you sure?
Absolutely sure?
Don't go away.
- There.
- Oh!
Isn't she pretty? Her name is Thumbelina.
Say hello, Thumbelina.
Now you say hello to her.
Hello.
She's very unhappy.
What's the matter, Thumbelina?
Are you unhappy because you're so little?
That's nothing to make such a sad face about, is it?
Here. Come on.
Though you're no bigger than my thumb
Than my thumb, than my thumb
Sweet Thumbelina, don't be glum
Now, now, now, ah, ah, ah, come, come, come
Thumbelina, Thumbelina tiny little thing
Thumbelina dance, Thumbelina sing
Oh, Thumbelina, what's the difference if you're very small?
When your heart is full of love, you're nine feet tall!
Oh, she's still unhappy. What's the matter,
Thumbie? Would you like a playmate?
You would? Here.
There. Say how do you do.
Want a kiss?
Would you like to dance?
You would? Well, here we go.
Thumbelina, Thumbelina, tiny little thing
Thumbelina dance, Thumbelina sing
Thumbelina, what's the difference if you're very small?
When your heart is full of love, you're nine feet tall!
Open up.
- Hans!
- Peter!
- What are you doing here?
- You're a cobbler?
- Yes.
- Hurry.
You are in the custody of the Royal Danish Ballet. Come along!
- What am I in the custody of?
- Shh! You're out - that's the main thing.
- They didn't treat you badly, Hans?
- No.
- Where's your coat?
- Here.
- Where are we going? Who is that man?
- What are you doing? Come along!
Come on, Hans. We've got our first job!
Straight! Straight!
Straight!
Keep the line straight!
Up! Up!
Good.
- This is the most...
- Shh! Dress rehearsal.
All right.
We'll do it all over again.
Ladies, the pirouettes were impossible.
Gentlemen, the lifts have to be higher.
The ballerina's performance
I won't begin to discuss.
That would take till tomorrow morning.
We'll do it again.
Not with these shoes, darling.
I told you before, remember?
Stop! Everything stop.
Is the cobbler here yet?
- Here I am.
- Come up here, cobbler.
Come on. Hurry up!
Cobbler, this lady will explain to you what she wants you to do.
It's a trifle complicated, but she's no ordinary dancer. She's something special.
Of all the dancers in Denmark, she is the only one who cannot follow my steps without special shoes that exist only in her mind.
All this she will make clear to you, perhaps.
We cannot understand so great a ballerina
We must only bow to her every wish.
Not quite low enough, my dear!
Come, sir. We can talk more quietly over there, I think.
Lunch, everybody.
You've seen the ballet when I make a jeté?
You know - when I jump.
I want to rise and then remain motionless, as though I were standing on nothing but air.
It is impossible with these shoes, but if you could put something in the tip of each one, I could do it, I'm sure I could, in spite of that unkind man.
I would so love to show him it is not impossible.
It is possible, isn't it?
Could you do it?
Yes.
Yes, I can do it.
I'll find something.
Something soft and silent.
I'm sure I can do it.
- You could really seem to stand on air.
- You have it!
I can see you have the idea perfectly.
I shall be so grateful to you.
There, can you do it now - quickly?
It would be such a service.
I would be forever grateful. Thank you.
Louise, my slippers!
You have to go out this way.
Hans!
Goodness, you were a long time!
Have we got a job?
- What are you holding?
- Slippers.
Slippers? I never saw slippers like that before. Who wears a thing like that?
- The loveliest lady I've ever seen.
- Why does she wear these?
She dances - no, she floats.
When she smiles, your heart skips a beat and then melts.
She smiled and stood close to me.
She even touched me.
Where's the barrow?
- I promised these to her quickly.
- Right over here.
I hid it here in the theatre storeroom.
She wants shoes that will walk on air,
Peter. This afternoon.
Well, she'll have them.
I wish she had asked me something really impossible.
Doro...
Are you hungry?
Do you love me?
Yes, even half-starved, I love you.
Come.
Sit down. Let me feed you.
Here. A sip of this to put you in a better temper.
And, look.
I asked Helga to make this especially for you today.
My darling, was I cruel today?
Oh, you were, my friend. You were indeed.
I was almost in tears.
- Doro, I'm sorry.
- Niels, don't be sorry.
It's just as it should be.
Don't you see that, my angel?
Professionally, we fight like two tigers, but afterwards...
That's what makes it so good afterwards.
Isn't it good now?
It's wonderful. Why do I forget that the minute you start to dance?
Then I see only my mortal enemy - the ballerina - in front of me.
Because the ballet is your life, just as it is mine.
Don't you think I sometimes forget you are my husband when I am dancing, and want to kill you for some of the things you say?
You really want to kill me?
Of course I do. Isn't that as it should be?
I would hate it any other way, wouldn't you?
Oh, Niels, we are lucky, and I do love you so.
I'm sorry about the shoes. I will behave beautifully this afternoon, you will see.
- Sorry about the shoes?
- There was nothing wrong with them.
I just did that to torment you.
Oh, you did?
I know exactly how to torment you, don't I, darling?
And you look so wonderfully poetic when you are in a rage, my dear.
Never mind how I look. So you just made up that little bit about the shoes, huh?
But you were being terrible.
You deserved it.
You let everyone sit around while you took your petty revenge?
You forget what you said in front of the entire company about my dancing?
No, I don't. I remember every word of it.
- I was right!
- Oh, you were?
Yes, and if you've finished stuffing yourself, I can say it again because we're going back to the rehearsal.
You danced the waltz like an elephant in a snowdrift!
What did you say?
I said you danced the waltz like an elephant in a snowdrift!
No, like an elephant who fell down and was trying to get up!
Can you hear me? Is that loud enough?
How dare you! I slave to make each step you give me just right.
I make your foolish little dance steps acceptable to an audience.
You don't slave hard enough.
Move in time to the music once in a while!
You are not just cruel, you are heartless.
Completely heartless.
You love to say cruel things to me! You would like to see me grovel at your feet!
- You'd see those steps clearer that way!
- How can I stand it?
How do I bear it?
Come - you can cry harder than that.
I've heard you cry much harder.
That, my girl, is for thinking up those shoes.
On stage, everybody!
Let's see what you can think up for this afternoon's rehearsal.
You've fixed the shoes? Good.
- Do you see what he's doing to her?
- Of course.
Never interfere between a husband and wife. It's the best rule I ever heard of.
You mean she's married to him?
- To that man?
- Very much married. Outside, please.
No one is allowed in the theatre during rehearsal. That's another very good rule.
How much do we owe you for the shoes, my boy?
How could you do it?
How could a girl like you marry a man like that?
How can I help you?
Dance! Dance!
Dance! Dance!
Dance!
Help me!
Help me!
Help me!
Help me!
Cobbler?
Cobbler! Thank you for the shoes. You left before I had a chance to thank you.
They were wonderful.
I really floated on air. Thank you.
Thank you.
Don't tell me what to do!
They'll work tomorrow.
They'll work till they get it right.
I'll see them drop in their tracks.
And you have my coat ready for me when I'm ready to leave!
Home!
What funny people they are over there.
They laugh and kiss, then they scream and beat each other. Kind of crazy.
What are you doing, Hans?
- Writing.
- A letter? To the children?
- Say something for me to them.
- It's not to the children.
What? Who are you writing to, Hans?
The ballerina.
Stop bothering me, Peter.
Why are you writing to the ballerina, Hans?
I heard him talk to her.
I saw him slap her face.
But, Hans, they're married.
I know that.
I heard them talking before you came in, Hans.
It was different.
Look, Peter, you're a child.
You don't understand.
I saw him make her cry with my own eyes.
- But, Hans, they...
- Don't bother me.
I must finish this tonight.
"The Little Mermaid.
A story for Mademoiselle Doro.
"And so, gradually, the little mermaid began to understand.
"She had sought love from the wrong man."
Come in.
I'm sorry, sir, but he insisted on seeing you immediately.
Shh. She's asleep. What's the trouble, doorman? Who's this little boy?
This is addressed to Mademoiselle Doro.
He was in the theatre trying to take it.
It seems to be a story, and it is addressed to her.
Why were you trying to take it?
- I wasn't trying to steal it. It's mine.
- Then why is it addressed to my wife?
- Niels, what is all this?
- It's mine! Please give it to me. It's mine!
Now, who wrote this?
I did.
You did?
Suppose you tell me why you happened to write this story to my wife?
It's nothing to do with you or her.
It's just a story.
He made up a story, that's all.
He's always making up stories, and he made up this one.
Now would you mind telling me just who he is?
We know you didn't write it, so you might just as well stop lying. Who is he?
A friend of mine.
What's his name?
Hans... Christian Andersen. The cobbler.
Darling, it's the cobbler.
The cobbler who fixed my shoes so beautifully yesterday.
He's written me a story for a ballet.
- I don't believe it!
- Tell the cobbler I am delighted to have it.
What was his name - Hans?
I will read it carefully.
- The Little Mermaid
- Stop it.
It is all very innocent and quite touching.
I haven't said good morning yet.
Good morning, darling.
Where have you been?
I've lost it. I can't find it any place.
Help me look, will you, Peter?
Just when I need you most, you disappear.
I'll have to write it all over again.
- You don't have to write it again.
- Don't stand there. Start looking.
- You don't have to write it over again.
- What?
She's got it.
What did you say?
She has it, Hans. Right now.
She has?
But how? How did she get it?
I was reading it and it blew out of my hands.
You took it?
But why? Never mind that, Peter. Go on.
It blew into the window of the theatre, and...
That's how she got it.
A wind took it to her.
It's an omen, Peter. An omen.
She's reading it now.
Don't go over there, Hans, don't.
I must, Peter. I've got to talk to her.
I can help her.
That chair and this sofa.
Let's get 'em on the wagon.
What's going on here?
What are you doing?
The ballet's moving out.
Moving out?
Excuse me.
- Is it true the ballet's moving out?
- That's right. Their yearly tour.
Where to? How long will they be gone?
There's the school bell.
Off to school. Hurry up.
Off with you now. Tomorrow's another day and another story.
I don't want any trouble with the schoolmaster. Hurry, children. Hurry.
What's the matter? Are you unhappy?
Would you like me to tell you a special story?
Come on up here.
Come on.
I'm not going to hurt you.
Go up a little faster.
Now, let me see...
There once was an ugly duckling
With feathers all stubby and brown
And the other birds, in so many words said, "Ptt! Get out of town!
"Ptt! Get out!
"Ptt! Ptt! Get out!
Ptt! Ptt! Get out of town!"
And he went with a quack and a waddle and a quack
In a flurry of eiderdown
Shall I tell you the rest of the story?
All right.
That poor little ugly duckling
Went wandering far and near
But at every place, they said to his face
"Now, ptt! Get out of here
"Ptt! Get out! Ptt! Ptt! Get out!
"Ptt! Ptt! Get out of here!"
And he went with a quack and a waddle and a quack
And a very unhappy tear
All through the wintertime, he hid himself away
Ashamed to show his face, afraid of what others might say
All through the winter, in his lonely clump of weed
Till a flock of swans spied him there and very soon agreed
"You're a very fine swan indeed!"
"A swan?
"Me a swan? Nah, go on."
They said, "Yes, you're a swan.
Look at yourself in the lake. You'll see."
And he looked and he saw and he said, "I am a swan!
"Whee!"
I'm not such an ugly duckling
No feathers all stubby and brown
For, in fact, these birds, in so many words said, "Tsk!
"The best in town!
"Tsk! The best! Tsk! Tsk! The best!
"Tsk! Tsk! The best in town!"
Not a quack, not a quack, not a waddle or a quack
But a glide and a whistle and a snowy white back
And a head so noble and high
Say who's an ugly duckling?
Not I!
Not I!
So, Lars, it shouldn't make any difference if they won't play with you.
But it does. I want to play with them, but they make fun of me because I was sick and the doctor shaved my head.
Yes, but look at what happened to the ugly duckling.
One day soon, you'll look in the mirror - much sooner than you think - and your hair will be grown out, and you'll be just like the ugly duckling.
You'll be better than any of them,
I promise.
- Are you sure, Hans?
- Very sure.
You'd better run off to school.
You're late now.
- Bye, Hans.
- Goodbye.
Cobbler, are my shoes ready?
Yes, ma'am. I have them here.
One mark, please.
- One mark? As much as that?
- Yes, ma'am. They're practically new.
How beautiful!
What kind of shoes are they?
Ballet slippers. I made them myself.
Every inch of them.
How lovely they are!
Please, ma'am. They might soil.
You understand.
Who wears such lovely things?
A lady who dances.
Her feet twinkle like little stars.
I assure you, the slippers won't even be noticed - she's so beautiful herself.
Thank you.
Thank you. Please come again.
Her arms were warm as they welcomed me
Her eyes were fire-bright
And then I knew that my path must be
Through the ever haunted night
For anywhere I wander
Anywhere I roam
Till I'm in the arms of my darling again
My heart will find no home
Anywhere I wander
Anywhere I roam
Anywhere I wander
Anywhere I roam
- You're Hans the cobbler?
- Yes, sir.
- I'm pleased to know you.
- How do you do?
You've no idea what this is all about, have you?
- No, sir.
- Well, I'm the father of the ugly duckling.
- Does that mean anything to you?
- Oh, you're Lars' father. I see.
That little story helped him over a bad time. I'm very grateful to you.
When I made inquiries, I found you had a lot more of these stories.
The children are full of them these days.
Do you ever write any of them?
- No, sir.
- Well, I've a little surprise for you. Come.
Give me a small sheet of paper.
Oh!
Oh!
Thank you very much.
- It's the finest present I've ever had.
- I'm delighted. Lars will be, too.
Could I say something, sir?
You wouldn't mind?
Of course not. Say anything you want to.
Well, instead of "Hans the cobbler", could it say "Hans Christian
Andersen", like a real writer?
Certainly!
If you write some of those stories down, just the way you tell them to the children,
I'll print them, and pay you for them.
I can hardly believe it!
- When will this be in the paper?
- Tomorrow.
It'll say "Hans Christian Andersen" all day tomorrow.
All day?
- Well, goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye.
All day?
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.
"The Ugly Duckling by Hans Christian Andersen."
I'm Hans Christian Andersen
That fortune has smiled upon
Although I'm a duckling today, tomorrow I'm a swan
A tale I told and it turned to gold, as gold as a tale can be
I laugh, ha ha, but I blush a bit for I realise while I'm reading it
That it's also reading me
"By Hans Christian Andersen"!
I am a swan!
I write myself a note each day and I place it in my hat
The wind comes by, the hat blows high but that's not the end of that
For round and round the world it goes
It lands here right behind myself
I pick it up and I read the note which is merely to remind myself
I'm Hans Christian Andersen
Andersen...
Peter!
I'm Hans Christian Andersen
I bring you a fable rare
There once was a table who said,
"How I'd love a chair"
And then and there came a sweet young chair
All dressed in a bridal gown
He said to her in a voice so true
"Now I did not say I would marry you, but I would like to sit down"
I'm Hans Christian Andersen
Andersen's in town!
"The Ugly Duckling by... Hans the Cobbler"!
You're looking at a writer. A real writer.
Tomorrow, the newspaper will say,
"Hans Christian Andersen" all day!
- Was that what the newspaper wanted?
- Yes.
They've printed one of your stories!
And the way it happened is like a story in itself. Wait till you hear.
Peter, from now on, if anybody asks you who you're working for, you can say a writer.
You are working for a real writer!
"The Ugly Duckling by Hans the Cobbler."
I can hardly believe it!
Peter...
Can you imagine...
Can you imagine the schoolmaster's face?
One day, a newspaper arrives from Copenhagen.
He opens it up and he looks, and suddenly...
He can't believe his eyes!
"Hans Christian Andersen?" he says.
"Hans the cobbler?
"A story by Hans Christian Andersen?
"Hmm. Fine story." Have a bite.
- There's something on your hand.
- That must be from the printing machine.
Peter...
Look.
- "Royal Danish Ballet returns from tour."
- Yes, Peter.
She's back!
Peter, she's back!
What a day!
Everything is happening at once!
Hans, we promised some shoes for today.
I'll do it later. I couldn't possibly sit still.
She's back! I've got to walk! She's back!
Never before and never again
Never before and never again
No two people have ever been so in love
Been so in love
Been so in love - it's incredible
No two people have ever been so in love
As my lovey dove and I
This is unique, the positive peak
We are the most unusual couple on earth
No two people have ever mooned such a moon, juned such a June
Spooned such a spoon
What he means is that no two people have ever been so in tune
As my macaroon and I
And when we kiss
- And when we kiss - what verse is this?
- It's hysterical, it's historical
- Let me tell it
- Certainly, darling.
No two people have ever been so in love
Been so in love
It's impossible. No two people have ever been so in love
As my lovey dove and I
This is the cream, the very extreme
The sort of a dream you couldn't imagine at all
No two people have ever been so in love as my lovey dove and I
No two people have ever been so in love
Been so in love, been so in love
No two people have ever been so in love
As you and Mrs Hans Christian
Andersen!
Mrs Andersen.
Mr Andersen.
Mrs Andersen.
Mr Andersen.
Mr Andersen?
Mr Andersen?
Mr Andersen?
Mr Andersen?
Mr Andersen!
How sweet of you to be here the very moment we return.
How did you know we were going to do your ballet?
Never mind. Your real reward will come tomorrow night when I dance it for you.
You will come, won't you?
Perhaps you will have words for me by tomorrow night?
Come, Louise.
What would they say back in the village?
You and me getting ready to go to the opera house in Copenhagen.
To see my ballet!
Would they believe it? Never.
"One of the cobbler's stories", they'd say.
"How can the children believe them?"
But even I wouldn't dare make up a story like this - and it happens to be true.
Is it all right if I don't go with you?
What?
- I said is it all right if I don't go with you?
- No!
It's not all right if you don't go with me.
What's the matter with you anyway?
Something's wrong with you.
Come inside.
Now, what's the matter, Peter?
Come on. Out with it.
I've been trying to tell you something, Hans, all day.
All right, Peter. Tell me now.
It's hard for me, Hans.
I don't know how to say it.
Never mind. Just say it.
I tried once to tell you, but you wouldn't listen.
Then they went away, and I thought you'd forget about it.
- They?
- I don't like people who laugh at you.
It hurts me when people laugh at you.
Back in the village when they made fun of you, I wanted to kill them.
Laugh at me? What are you talking about, Peter?
Her and him. You don't understand them.
What don't I understand?
You're making up a story about them, like you do about everything else, only this time it's about them, not clocks and flowers and stars.
- She'll laugh at you, Hans!
- So that's it.
I thought so.
Is she laughing at me when she does my ballet?
Was she laughing at me when she kissed me?
- She kissed you?
- Yes.
You didn't know that, did you?
- I don't care. It's true what I'm saying.
- I'm sorry you said that, Peter.
You never lied to me before.
You don't have to come with me tonight.
Maybe you'd better see if you can find work with somebody else.
You're old enough now to be by yourself, and...
...I think we'd better part company altogether because...
...because I don't think we like each other any more.
I beg your pardon.
No one's allowed in before the performance.
I am Hans Christian Andersen.
- The author of the ballet they're doing.
- Oh, good evening.
Don't you read the posters outside your own theatre?
Make it lower.
Up, down again, around - that's it.
That's it.
Stay together.
Around...
Good. That's much better. Keep it up.
That's it. Now go around.
Come around this way.
Who are you? Get out of here at once.
Don't deliver shoes before a performance!
Leave them with the doorman.
- Try the arabesque again.
- The name is Andersen.
- Hans Christian Andersen.
- Andersen? The ballet writer!
I'd like to deliver these shoes to Mademoiselle Doro.
Be a good fellow and get out now.
- Will you move the big shell upstage?
- Yes, sir.
Go out front and watch your ballet.
- I'll give her the shoes myself.
- No! Don't you touch them.
You can't give them to her now.
No one sees her before an opening.
Can you show us where you want the shell?
I can't be everywhere at once.
Just move it on stage.
Will you please escort Mr Andersen to the stage door? Quietly but firmly.
But I have these...
If you please, I'd like to leave alone.
Not you again! Don't you understand this is no time to bother anybody?
Mademoiselle Doro would not agree with you.
Why am I plagued with authors on opening nights? Why?
- Overture in three minutes.
- In three minutes, we begin!
Ladies, take your places!
Open that door! Let me out of here!
I can see it.
I don't have to see her with my eyes.
I can see it all.
Come in!
- Good morning, madame.
- Good morning, Céline.
- It's not a very nice day, I'm afraid.
- It looks lovely to me, Céline.
And how good it feels to be back in my own room. It seems years.
That it does, and what a wonderful success last night!
I can hardly ever remember the audience being so excited.
It was the new ballet.
They were enchanted with it.
And it is enchanting. I love to dance it.
What a curious fellow he is.
- He never turned up at all.
- Who, madame?
Hans, the cobbler. You know?
I wonder if he was even there. Do you suppose he was there and was too shy...
- Good heavens!
- I thought you were fast asleep.
- The cobbler's locked in the prop room!
- What are you talking about?
I locked him up last night, just before the performance. I had to.
He insisted on giving you some shoes five minutes before the ballet began.
He never saw the ballet?
You kept him locked up?
- I forgot, I tell you.
- You big fool!
I had other things to think about just then!
Quickly, Céline. Go to the theatre and bring him back here.
That poor dear man!
And you, you monster, you'd better stay under there.
Try popping your head out and see what you get.
The lamp over it, I promise you!
Oh, Hans.
I shall call you Hans. What a dreadful thing to have happened! Are you all right?
It's just like him to have done such a thing. Come.
Sit down.
- Would you like a cup of chocolate?
- No, thank you.
You missed seeing the ballet.
We will do it again two nights from now, and you will see it then.
- But I did see the ballet.
- You did?
- Yes.
- How?
- I thought you were...
- I was, but I could hear the music.
I knew the story the music was telling.
I didn't have to see you dance with my eyes.
Oh, Hans, how very dear you are, and how I love to dance it.
I don't know quite why. It's very strange.
Even when we rehearsed it,
I felt something sad and tender.
- I don't know why.
- I know why.
You do? Tell me.
- I think it was your answer.
- My answer?
I let my heart speak to you with the story, and...
...last night, you answered me with yours.
Hans, tell me something. How did you come to write that story for me?
How else could I tell you how I felt?
That I knew how miserable you were with him?
Miserable? With my husband?
Yes, I don't think you knew I was there, but I saw the way he treated you.
I saw him slap you.
I heard you cry.
Oh, Hans...
- How else could a cobbler speak to you?
- It's arrived, my darling. It's here!
Good morning, Andersen. Your present, angel. My apologies for last night.
You must forgive me. It was your ballet
I was thinking of, not you.
Did you tell him what a great success it was? For a great lady of the ballet.
Open it! We shall be poor for the next year, but I had to have it for you.
The best part's on the other side.
Turn it over and read it.
Read it aloud. I'm not a poet like you,
Andersen, but once in a while, even a fool like me can speak of love.
Are you pleased, my darling?
Read it for me.
Not now, Niels. Later.
You're not shy suddenly? Never mind.
You can do anything you wish.
She danced like an angel.
I could cover you with kisses.
Please don't, Niels.
Haven't you forgiven me?
Andersen has, I'm sure.
She was furious at me for locking you up, but no harm has been done.
It's even rather amusing.
Don't you look so stern, my dear.
You were laughing about it yourself.
Don't tell me I didn't hear you laughing -
I did. Even under the covers.
- Be quiet.
- What's the matter with you, Doro?
Hans, it doesn't matter why you wrote the story for me.
It's a beautiful story, whatever the reason.
It's a lovely and tender story by itself, but I shall remember what you told me every time I dance it.
- Andersen, we haven't paid you for it.
- Niels, do be quiet.
We want to pay him, don't we?
We'd like you to write more for us.
- Have you any other stories we can use?
- No. That one was just an accident.
I don't think I'll be writing any more.
I guess it's all right to deliver these now.
Some shoes from the cobbler.
Thank you, Hans.
- But, Andersen, I...
- Niels, let him go. Goodbye, Hans.
Doro...
Doro, what is it, my darling?
Peter!
Peter! Peter!
Peter!
Hello, Peter.
Do you mind if I walk along beside you?
I don't see how I can help it.
We both seem to be going in the same direction, and there's only one road.
Are you going back to the village?
I'm going back to the village, too.
Bread and butter!
And you know something, Peter?
I'm never telling another story - not even to myself.
I've told my last story, Peter.
Especially to myself.
Cobbler, stick to your last.
If any man ever learned his lesson and learned it good, it's me.
- I think you'll go on telling stories.
- No, I won't.
- Yes, you will.
- No, I won't.
Why do you keep on saying that?
Why? Because you're Hans Christian Andersen.
That's why!
Peter!
You'll tell stories.
You'll write stories.
You'll even sing stories.
Over and over and over again.
I'm not such an ugly duckling
No feathers all stubby and brown
For, in fact, these birds, in so many words
Said, "Tsk! The best in town!
"Tsk! The best! Tsk! Tsk! The best!"
Remember your trip to Copenhagen? Tell us about it!
Wonderful, wonderful Copenhagen
Friendly old girl of a town
'Neath her tavern light
On this merry night, let us clink and drink one down
To wonderful, wonderful
Copenhagen...
- Tell us about the king! The king!
- Yes, the king!
The king is in the altogether, but altogether, the altogether
He's altogether as naked as the day that he was born
The king is in the altogether, but altogether, the altogether
It's altogether the very least the king has ever worn
Call the court physician, call an intermission...
Hans! My favourite, huh?
Thumbelina!
Though you're no bigger than my thumb
- Than my thumb
- Than my thumb
- Sweet Thumbelina, don't be glum
- Don't be glum
- Now, now, now
- Ah, ah, ah, come along
Everybody!
Thumbelina, Thumbelina, tiny little thing
Thumbelina dance, Thumbelina sing
Thumbelina, what's the difference if you're very small?
When your heart is full of love, you're nine feet tall!
Hans Christian Andersen!

What do you know...
He finally made it.
He was pretty far away when it happened.
- Europe or some place like that.
- That's his story.
We'd better go down and say hello.
- Not me.
- He is our father.
I'll never say hello to him.
Goodbye, maybe.
Mother would have wanted us to.
We don't have no mother.
She's dead.
- Shut up. You give me the creeps.
- My mother is dead!
Let's go down.
We'll leave little Frankenstein here.
- She is, too.
- Shut up.
Be quiet.
I hate everybody. I hate everybody in the whole wide world.
I bought it from a short fellow in Munich.
Wait, Aunt Carolyn.
Come on, jump.
He is supposed to jump.
Come on, jump.
All right, Tom.
Mother and I must be getting home.
Many arrangements have to be made.
- The children have enough toys.
- I bought this one for me.
Alice didn't bother to have the car insured before that terrible accident.
She was as haphazard about that as she was about choosing her husband.
Don't worry. I will take on the additional financial burden.
If you don't mind, I prefer to worry.
As long as you're in my house, you're going to have some manners.
- Hello, Robert, old man.
- I'm not an old man.
He's getting there.
That's a darling thing.
Is that how it works?
You're from another planet.
Thank you.
I think that's a compliment.
I was just about to do that.
All you had to do was pull the switch...
The children seem to be happy with our side of the family.
The divorce wasn't final, but we're both lawyers and there shouldn't be any difficulty making the custody permanent.
- Carolyn, where is your husband?
- John is out, Father.
When is he ever in? Both of my daughters made the wisest choices.
Tom, Mother and I will take Elizabeth to live with us.
And Carolyn and her husband will take the boys.
It will be wonderful for the boys.
I'll move the guesthouse and put in a swimming-pool.
They have been helping plan it.
- Is that OK with you?
- Sure. It's a real blast here.
We've got a tennis court, horses, the river, everything.
I'll be living right down the road.
I can come over any time.
- How about you?
- I don't care where I live.
Well, it happens that I care. I don't want my kids parcelled out like cabbages.
They don't parcel out cabbages, they are sold in carload lots.
Since when are you interested in your children?
How long were you and Alice separated?
Three years? Four?
When did you see your children?
Occasionally on a weekend?
You know my job with the government...
Your job is more important than your children?
You may sign the custody agreement in my office in the morning.
Elizabeth, it's getting late.
All your things are in the car.
We'd better go home now.
OK, Gramps.
See you in the morning.
I'll come over lots of times.
It will be all right.
- Bye bye, sweetie.
- See you tomorrow, Aunt Carolyn.
Goodbye.
No, he is your father.
Why don't you give him a kiss?
- Sure.
- No, wait.
Get your things from that Black Maria and put them in the jeep.
And you two, get your clothes, you are coming to Washington with me.
We'll stay with Aunt Carolyn.
She's got horses and everything.
- Can he do that?
- You bet I can.
You won't miss them.
I'll send a carload of cabbages.
Remember, you're still under my jurisdiction, the three of you.
Get your things together.
I'll wait for you outside. Carolyn, I...
- What should we do?
- What can we do?
He's got the law on his side.
We have to go with him.
- He ain't gonna like it.
- Nope.
Tom... Where are you going to put the children?
I still have my flat in Washington.
It's a little small, but...
We don't have to get rid of the guesthouse, if you all wanted to stay here.
How are you and John getting along these days?
It's one of those modern marriages.
Electric blankets and everything.
Sorry.
That's Robert's harmonica.
You'll get to know it well.
It's recent.
David is becoming a problem too.
He's been taking things.
- What?
- Elizabeth can't sleep nights.
How will you learn how to be a father after all these years?
I'll get a booklet from the Department of Agriculture.
Congratulations, Mother Goose.
I'm very proud of you.
- Good luck, Tom.
- Thank you, Carolyn.
- Home, sweet home.
- Oh, brother: Sing Sing!
You said you only needed my jeep for a couple of hours.
A few problems came up.
Robert, Elizabeth and David, this is Captain Alan Wilson.
- They are going to live with me.
- In that rabbit hutch upstairs?
Could you and your wife help me get a maid?
A maid? In Washington?
The only way you get help here is to elect them.
You better get them inside, it's starting to rain.
Hope it clears up. I'll show them all of Washington tomorrow.
You kids will have quite a holiday.
Holiday? It will be more of a kidnapping. Come on.
- What's the matter?
- I'm afraid.
What are you afraid of?
Listen to what's going on out there and I'm alone in that room.
You're lucky.
Look at us in this barracks.
- But you're together.
- Only in body.
Come on, back to bed.
Lie down.
Come on, darling.
Take it easy.
Remember what I used to tell you?
Thunder is just two bodies of air coming together after an electrical disturbance.
- Got it?
- Got it.
- But I'm still worried.
- So am I.
What in the blazes is that?
Ain't that wonderful!
Let's enjoy the day.
That's the Washington Monument.
That's 555 feet high.
It's dedicated to the memory of George Washington.
He died December 14th, 1799.
Over there is the memorial to Thomas Jefferson, the third President of the United States.
He died on July 4th...
That's one of the most striking examples of...
Robert, you ought to pay attention.
You're getting a sightseeing tour of one of the most beautiful cities in the world.
Do you have to talk about dead people all the time?
There's nothing in this whole city but dead people.
I want to go back to Aunt Carolyn.
All right, no more monuments.
Tonight we'll go to the
Watergate Concert by the river.
This afternoon I'll take you to the National Museum.
- What's in a museum?
- Dead people.
- Come on.
- Where are you going to drag us now?
- How about some ice-cream?
- Good idea.
Don't tell me I had a good idea, at last.
Is my mother in a museum?
- No.
- Good.
- I got that seat.
- No, it's mine!
Cut it out. Come on.
Give me that thing.
Robert Winters.
Your father is looking for you.
Come to the parking area.
Robert Winters.
Come to the parking area immediately.
What a delightful concert.
You are so kind.
Have you met my daughter?
- How do you do?
- Delighted.
You must be having have the time of your life. All America at your feet.
- At my father's feet.
- It's the same thing.
- I'd like to talk to you, Signor Zaccardi.
- By all means. Come here.
It's all settled.
Your father has agreed.
You'll all come to my place for a cosy supper.
About 40 or 50 of the best people.
Will you excuse me?
I've got a terrible headache.
She hasn't been feeling well.
- Cinzia.
- Yes, I do not have a headache.
Do you know who this woman is?
The Boston Symphony.
"We'll have a cosy supper.
40 or 50 of the best people."
I'm tired of the best people.
I wish I could meet some of the worst people.
Papa, one night.
Let me have tonight alone.
I don't want to leave America without having met an American.
What do you do with a girl like this?
I'm not a rich man.
Best schools in Switzerland for her.
Last month she climbs out of a window and runs away.
One night without talking about Stravinsky or Rossini or you conducting La Scala at the age of 14.
I'm 22 and I haven't yet given my first performance for a man, any man.
Go ahead. Have a daughter.
See what happens.
You will come to the supper with us.
Do you understand?
You haven't eaten all day.
Without food, everything is discord.
A starving orchestra I had tonight.
Wash your face.
Compose yourself. We will wait.
Wait.
Is this your boat?
No. I will pay you...
As soon as I get some money.
You don't have to, it's not my boat either.
- Where are you going?
- Over there. Where the music is.
Good. That's where I'm going too.
Why don't you go home, little boy? It's late.
Ciao, ciao.
Go home.
Go home.
Hot pizza, here.
We've got hot pizza here, 25 cents.
We've got hot pizza here.
My friend...
Would you like me to show you how to eat that properly?
So you don't waste any.
You see?
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.
Three rings for one dime.
Step this way, folks.
Everybody gets a winner.
Look at those prizes.
Fantastic prizes.
Three rings for one dime.
Everybody wins here, folks.
Three rings here.
Look at the fantastic prizes.
Come right here.
Three rings for one dime.
Fantastic prizes.
Everybody has a winner.
You muffed it, son.
Everybody has got a winner here.
My last dime.
Everybody's got a winner, everybody.
Except me, I never win anything.
Your lucky dime, son.
Everybody's got a winner.
Three for one dime here, folks.
Look at the fantastic prizes.
It can't go half way, it's gotta go all the way down.
You can take three.
He won, he won!
Your father, the Chief of Police, will be so happy.
Congratulations, lady.
Everybody wins here!
Good night. Goodbye.
Don't you want to hear me play the harmonica?
Why don't you go home? It's late.
Go home to your mother.
Would you like to dance?
Would you like to dance?
My friend.
Are you sure?
No sign of him yet?
He's been murdered.
Yes, he's about four feet.
Oh, "eyes"?
- Grey.
- Blue.
Blue.
You can reach me at the Department of State.
Legal Division. Thank you.
- Robert, where have you been?
- You've found him.
- Are there any broken bones?
- No, he's all right.
- Let me have him.
- She promised to put me to bed.
- Her name is Cinzia, she's my friend.
- Hello.
I tried to find out your address, but he didn't wish to come home.
You must have done something terrible to him.
Yes, I took him to a concert.
- Let her carry me. I like it.
- The bedroom is over there.
- Did you have fun?
- It was a ball.
If you try that again, you'll get a spanking you'll never forget.
Yes, a spanking solves so many things.
Or a slap in the face.
It's easier than understanding.
Two points for her.
Welcome to our side, Cinzia.
Could you come back tomorrow and take care of us?
We can't get a maid. It's rough.
I would like to very much, but I'm preoccupied.
- That is the right word?
- Yes, that will do.
I'd like to thank you properly but may I have my family back for a few minutes first?
Can you wait for me in the other room?
- Arrivederci, Roberto.
- Roberto is me, it's Italian.
- Really?
- Good night.
Good night. Thank you for the dance.
Any time.
Here are your pyjamas.
We'd better let Robert sleep in the bed since he's been out on the town all night.
I won it fair and square, ask my friend.
You're not on trial.
- Daddy...
- Take off your pants.
- What were you saying?
- Make her be our maid.
Offer her a lot of money.
It would be fun.
- We'll talk about it tomorrow.
- That's the last we'll hear of that.
I hire the help around here.
I can't take any girl you find on the street.
- You don't like her because I like her.
- That's ridiculous.
You keep us here in this city and don't let us go back to Aunt
Carolyn because we like her, too.
- That isn't the reason.
- Well, what is?
Go to sleep.
You don't like us.
You don't like us at all.
Well, I don't like you.
I don't like anybody.
I don't like this old harmonica any more.
I wish it hit you and killed you dead.
Don't you care, Robert.
I like you.
Thank you so much.
I'm sincerely grateful.
Here.
All right, here's five more.
- Apparently, gratitude has gone up.
- But I don't want this money.
Would you mind answering me a personal question?
How long is it since you had a bath?
- Cosa?
- A bath.
You look as if you need a good scrubbing.
How long has it been?
Well... I don't remember.
A bottle of Chianti, a loaf of bread.
A corner in which to sleep.
It's not a bad life, is it?
How would you like a job as a maid to the children?
For $100 a month to start?
That's nonsense.
Thank you again and good night.
Good night.
Be nice to Roberto.
Please don't spank him.
I'll handle my own family.
I've done all right so far.
- Why did he run away?
- Must there be a reason?
- Always. Where is their mother?
- What?
- Their mother.
- You are looking at her.
- I'm a little new at the job.
- I'm sorry.
Roberto tells me he is very unhappy.
Sounds as if Roberto and you had quite an evening.
He doesn't like the hot city.
He wants to be near the river.
Why do you let him stay here in this tiny box?
You must have had a lot of experience raising children.
I have no experience.
But I know when a little child is unhappy.
And how I know when a father is unreasonable!
Try to be a parent, not a policeman.
I don't know what you know about parents, but I imagine you had a wide acquaintance amongst policemen.
I'll call one if you keep that up.
I gave you some money, get yourself a room for tonight.
Do you like this? This picture?
Of course.
That's why I have it.
- It's a Cézanne.
- I know. Paul Cézanne.
You cut it down to fit the frame, right?
How sad for you.
It's only a print.
Buy a real one. Ciao.
Two o'clock in the morning.
You've found a man, am I right?
Yes, I've found a man.
He's seven years old.
In America that's old enough.
Get some rest.
We leave in the morning for Chicago, where I won't let you out of my sight.
Only two days in this country.
You will come with us to Chicago,
Boston, San Francisco.
Then we come back to Washington. Come.
What can you do in this awful city by yourself?
A girl, all alone.
No money.
Not a penny will I give you.
You will starve.
- Perhaps I will get a job.
- A job?
I have given you the finest education in all of Europe.
You do not know how to do anything.
Then perhaps I will run for the Congress.
Hello? Who?
Tom.
The what?
The guesthouse?
Yes, they started moving it to the new lot today. Why?
Don't be silly, I won't sell it to you.
You can have it.
If you insist... A thousand.
You drive a hard bargain.
Who finally convinced you the city was no place for children?
It was my own idea.
Why did you wait until they were asleep to call me?
Dear Carolyn, you are all-knowing, all-seeing and shut up.
It will be in the new foundation first thing in the morning.
Good night.
- I don't want to go.
- Who wanted to live in the country?
I have to spend the whole summer commuting.
I've been on a used-car lot all morning, picking out a reasonably priced car.
- Where's my friend Cinzia?
- I tried to hire her.
- I offered her a lot of money.
- You don't like her.
I'd have given her my right arm if she'd taken the job.
- I've got a nosebleed.
- If she's not coming, I'm not going!
- The cops are ticketing your car.
- And the building's on fire.
- Hello.
- Well, hello.
I knew you would come back.
You are going to be our maid.
- Wait a minute.
- If you still want me, yes.
He was going to give his right arm, weren't you?
You told me you didn't want the job.
It doesn't look as if she needs one.
Where did you get those clothes?
- My father.
- You can help me pack.
I don't know anything about you.
You are from Italy, aren't you?
- Si.
- That means "yes".
- Are you a G.I. Bride or something?
- Yes, almost.
- Almost? What does that mean?
- I arrived.
He didn't marry me.
So I must work.
That's a sad story.
But I don't think this is the job for you.
- Besides, we're going to the country.
- I adore the country.
- What's wrong?
- Nosebleed.
- Get me a damp cloth and hurry.
- That settles it. She stays.
She can't stay with us.
That guesthouse is too small.
Try to look at it from my viewpoint.
Perhaps you'd better not.
- How are you?
- That's fine. It's stopped.
- I was just about to do that.
- We'll go and wash your face.
Come on, David, we'll help.
You wouldn't believe it.
Hello, Alan.
Any luck trying to sublet this apartment?
We lined up a few prospects, but they say the rent is too high.
- OK, I'll knock off $25 a month.
- The wife and I will take it.
I can't tell you what a help you are.
Let's get the luggage out.
I'm so sorry.
We've taken a vote and it's unanimous.
Cinzia stays.
You can vote too, but you'll lose.
Three to one.
- We've figured it out.
- Thank you.
- Who's she?
- Apparently she's the maid.
- Three to one.
- Upstairs or downstairs maid?
What difference does that make?
I don't want you wearing yourself out.
- Alan, I'm getting her for my children.
- Adopt me.
Well, we're almost at our new house.
I think it's going to be wonderful.
Don't you?
Just put down a new foundation this morning.
You remember the guesthouse, colonial style, green shutters.
Isn't that the house we're trying to pass?
What?
- Isn't that the house we're trying to pass?
- It's supposed to be on the lot.
Should I knock on the door and ask what happened?
Hold it!
Wait!
Stay there.
This house should have been set up this morning.
Are you Mr Winters?
I'm Angelo. How do you do?
- About this house...
- I could throw the bull all day...
But I'm straight from the shoulder.
Do you appreciate that kind of talk?
- From the bottom of my heart.
- I got drunk.
I've three children on my hands.
What am I to do?
What a party.
You should have been there.
If this house is not up by nightfall,
I'll sue you for every penny you have.
Two of them were redheads.
I feel a little unbalanced myself.
If this is the usual way...
Now look what you've done.
You can't even drive.
You've smashed in the whole side of the car.
- Where are you going?
- Welcome to historic Virginia. My card.
If you ever want anything moved, call on Angelo.
Angelo, I hear a train coming.
The house is on the tracks.
Angelo, the house!
Cinzia, can't you hear the train coming?
How can a man be that stupid?
- Dad, there's a train coming.
- How nice.
Look at that oil.
I bet the transmission is damaged.
- Dad, the train.
- You go and watch it.
The crankcase is probably cracked too.
- Dad, look. The train.
- All right. Go and wave at the engineer.
Why didn't you tell me the train was coming?
Choke it!
Is the ignition on?
Is your foot on the clutch?
I've started lots of cars.
Which was my room?
You'll love it.
Wait till you see it.
It's secluded.
I only use it on weekends.
We can stay there until the car is fixed.
Here we are.
- Where?
- The river.
Did you ever see anything so beautiful?
Never. Are you out of your mind?
Try it for one night.
You better, I think it's going to rain.
If you like it,
I'll make you a good deal.
I figure I owe it to you.
Perhaps there is a nice, comfortable hotel.
If you're willing to pay for putting up a nice comfortable family of five.
Or you could sell an old Cézanne you may have hanging around.
Let me show it to you.
What can you lose?
- It's the best location around.
- I think that's poison ivy.
Down there is my old man's grocery store, and across the river is the country club.
There's a better class of people at the grocery store, but that's up to you.
I'm not going across that shaky thing.
It's as solid as the Rock of Gibraltar.
It's not so bad after closing your eyes.
Roberto, don't you dare!
Come on, what are you worried about?
- Come on.
- Don't be afraid.
- It's as solid as the Rock of Gibraltar.
- Come on. Hurry up.
Perhaps there is a nice, comfortable hotel.
This place has everything.
It's got a generator and batteries for electricity.
You've got a gas-stove for cooking.
An ice-box.
A linoleum cupboard sink.
You'll love it here, it's a palace.
There isn't another place like this around.
- That's a neat knife.
- What are you doing?
- It's neater this way.
- Like a palace.
Shall I show you where the water is coming in?
Let me show you how beautiful it is outside.
I'm just trying to show you the place.
You have three bedrooms down here, the master bedroom is upstairs and here comes the...
- Watch that beam.
- Thank you, I will.
Let's go outside.
I want to show you around.
We've got a freshwater tank on the top deck for showers... everything.
There's real live spiders up here.
Save them, we may need them for dinner.
Mrs McGillicuddy, the lady who owns the farmhouse around the bend, she supplies the water from her well.
- What did you say her name was?
- Mrs McGillicuddy.
We have an arrangement.
I blow the horn...
She turns on the tap, right away, running water.
She's a little hard-of-hearing.
We can stay at Aunt Carolyn's tonight and go back to the city tomorrow.
I have sublet the apartment.
I doubt if there's another vacant apartment in the whole of Washington DC.
Then we'll just stay at Aunt Carolyn's forever.
How about it?
Angelo, we are going to stay here for the night.
It can be fixed up.
It's a wonderful place for kids.
And not so bad for spiders.
I'll go fix the gangplank and bring your stuff in.
Keep your motor running,
I'll be around.
- What does he mean?
- Let's get off this junk heap.
After Cinzia does a little cleaning and polishing it might be quite comfortable.
Who, I?
It will take years.
- I bet the roof leaks.
- Let's make the best of things.
Let's play a game while we wait for Angelo.
- I don't know any game.
- We used to play a game.
"Who sir, me sir?"
Sure you remember that.
- What was I?
- You were Red cap.
He was Black cap.
You were Gold cap. Let's play.
- Black cap!
- Who sir, me sir?
- Who then sir, say Boxer.
- Boxer.
Who sir, me sir?
Thank you, Mrs McGillicuddy.
Did you fix the generator?
There's nothing wrong with kerosene lamps.
They are rather quaint.
- You can't see so good with them.
- Of course you can.
- I warned you.
- You should be in bed.
Come and see what Cinzia invented for us.
When the fish comes, the bell rings and announces his arrival.
Very nice.
Do you think if you'll attach one end to a dust rag, the fish might dust for you?
You hardly got started tonight.
They gave Hercules much more time to clean Augean stables.
Every employer is different.
Get to bed and get started early in the morning.
Here's the knife, David.
Where did you get that knife?
It was on the ground, near the truck.
That fellow who drove it must have dropped it.
Why didn't you tell him?
I needed a knife.
I beg your pardon.
It wasn't on the ground, was it?
- Give it to me.
- I didn't steal it, I swear on the Bible.
I'm really ashamed of you.
I know. I can't start a car either.
You go to sleep.
I'll wake you if a fish comes.
You won't need to.
I won't be asleep.
- Then you wake me.
- Sure.
- Are you all right?
- Fine.
I've read this communiqué.
It's your schedule. Quite simple.
7:15 am, wake the children.
7:25 am clean sink, pantry and ice-box.
7:45 am, prepare breakfast.
What's wrong about that?
It's no use.
I'm leaving in the morning.
Will you explain to the children, please?
Explain?
There's no way I can explain.
They will be certain
I've thrown you out.
I cannot stay.
I simply cannot stay here.
I'm sorry.
Would you like some, too?
Yes, I would like some.
Especially if it will help break down the social barriers between capital and labour.
In this case,
I'm not sure who is who.
You're hardly my idea of the faithful family retainer, but you've got to stay. They want you.
I've lost touch.
It's too bad.
We used to be such friends.
Never mind.
It will probably take an act of Congress to get me back into this family.
They do like you. You will see.
I was never cut out for it.
I'm one of the undomesticated animals.
But when they lost their mother,
I thought it might be best to come home and try to make it up to them.
It never occurred to me they wouldn't want to have me around.
Isn't that curious?
Every other place I go, grown-ups seem to want me.
In certain circles I'm considered quite charming and debonair.
But children can look through me as if there were nothing there.
Well, maybe there isn't.
Maybe their mother found that out a long time ago.
They say the fishing is good after a thunderstorm.
- Good night.
- Good night.
7:15, I'll wake the children.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Ciao.
- Ciao.
Cinzia, I'm afraid, I'm afraid.
- So am I.
- Don't you like thunder either?
No, I'm frightened every time.
In the war, it was like this every night.
I wouldn't like war.
When I was a child, I thought I would.
But not now.
My mother, on such a night...
Our big house... gone.
So you see, where I live, everybody is frightened of the thunder.
If my father lived there, he'd tell them it was just two pieces of air coming together.
I'm so sick of those two pieces of air.
When I was a little girl, my father would say,
"Cinzia, pazzerella." Foolish.
They are no help, fathers.
- Listen, can I get into bed with you?
- Yes.
Wait a minute, why not in bed with your father?
He wouldn't want me, he would say I was...
- Pazzerella?
- Yes.
He doesn't like me to be a baby.
Elizabeth, did you ever think that your father is afraid too?
- Him?
- He doesn't want anyone to know.
Sometimes it is very difficult to be a grown-up.
Why don't you go upstairs to him?
It's a terrible night.
Well, I've got to get in bed with somebody.
Why don't you come too?
He's got a big bed.
I don't think it's big enough.
SCHEDULE
7:15 AM, WAKE CHILDREN...
- You'll wake her.
- That's what I intend to do.
- I have to be at the office in 45 minutes.
- Can't you shake her a little?
- You shake her.
- Are you scared?
- Yes, I'm scared.
- Chicken.
Cinzia, wake up.
- Buongiorno, Roberto.
- Buongiorno. I'm not alone.
The children are supposed to be dressed and breakfast on the table.
The kids want oatmeal, and I like scrambled eggs and bacon.
The eggs dry, the bacon crisp.
Toast and coffee.
There is one thing you ought to know.
One little thing.
I do not cook.
- You do not cook?
- No.
- Why didn't you tell me that?
- You never asked.
- You can scramble an egg, can't you?
- Yes.
What do you mean, "scramble"?
Just take the kids down to the village for their breakfast.
I'll have just some coffee.
You can make coffee, I hope?
Not American coffee.
Do you have an espresso-maker?
Never mind.
I can do without food and I can do without coffee.
- You eat too much anyway.
- Thank you.
Go back to sleep.
- Daddy, wait!
- What?
- I've made American coffee.
- I read her the label.
- What?
- I read her the label.
I don't see how you could.
It's still here in the coffee.
You don't like it?
She burned her hand twice.
- It's wonderful.
- Then why don't you drink it?
You don't want to hurt her feelings, do you?
- Good, isn't it?
- Holy...
Delicious.
I don't see how you Americans can stomach this.
We're a young country.
I doubt if we'll grow much older.
- Goodbye.
- Bye, Daddy.
What brought that on?
- What?
- You kissing me goodbye?
- Don't I always?
- How foolish of me not to have noticed.
Take it easy.
Pretty good repair-job on the car.
Listen to that motor.
Did you make up your mind about the boat?
Do you want to rent, buy, make a deal?
It's a leaky, broken-down derelict, that will probably sink and dump us all in the river.
But I wouldn't think of living in any other place.
I'll make a deal.
Can you select a melon for me?
The 4th of July.
The Sons of Italy Ball.
We'll tie one on together.
What do you say?
Do you want to be the lucky girl this year?
You have a certain native charm.
Reserve it for the natives.
- Elizabeth!
- Aunt Carolyn.
Hi, sweetie.
I saw David at the houseboat.
He told me you were shopping.
Cinzia is getting melon and prosciutto -
That's ham.
You eat it cold and don't have to cook it.
- Who's Cinzia?
- Cinzia is our maid.
- She doesn't know how to cook.
- So I see. Where is your father?
He is doing the laundry at the Laundromat.
We have to bring our clothes there.
Cinzia doesn't know how to wash.
- What does she do?
- Everything.
- They have been married for 15 years.
- What happened?
Mr Winters, your first batch is dry.
Would you put it over on the table, please?
Harry told her that he was going to night baseball games every night.
Every night?
That's an awful lot of baseball.
He carried a portable radio so he could keep up with the games in case she asked him any questions.
They are sneaky... Men.
- So Gertrude followed him.
- Naturally.
He met this blonde at this motel.
Took a room?
Do you know anybody that goes to a motel to sit in the lobby?
Well, she listened at the door.
The bases were loaded and there were two out.
So she peaks through the keyhole.
Pretty dirty, it needs another...
Bases loaded, two out.
- I'll tell you later.
- Hi.
I've been looking for you.
Can we go someplace and talk?
My laundry is in for another inning, is it important?
Not very. It's just that John and I are through, I've filed suit.
I'll tell you later.
Let me know the final score.
I can't say I'm surprised.
Any chance of you and John patching it up?
None. Obviously, there's another woman.
Is there another man?
Now that you bring it up, yes, there is one.
- Do I know him?
- Not very well.
Daddy, come here.
I want to talk to you.
- Can I, I mean tonight too?
- Of course.
- Even if it doesn't thunder?
- Especially.
Isn't that nice?
That's a clever idea.
How did you think of that?
Once in the Vatican, I was looking up and I said to myself,
"How in the devil did Michelangelo paint that ceiling?"
I always thought he had a pogo stick.
Isn't that amazing?
Now they match. Thank you.
- Who sir, me sir?
- Yes sir, you sir.
- No sir, not I sir.
- Who then sir?
- Gold Cap.
- Who sir, me sir?
- No sir, not I sir.
- Who then sir?
Want to get in the game?
No. These ropes are shot.
I'm going to change them.
You'll set the whole boat adrift.
Angelo is coming tomorrow.
Leave it for someone who knows how.
Sure. I forgot for a minute that I was a lamebrain.
Sometimes you behave like one.
Where did you get all that new rope?
Go to your room.
You're not getting anything to eat tonight.
Thanks. I'm trying to lose weight.
Now, where were we?
Thank you, Michelangelo.
Now everything matches.
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
- Who is it?
- David.
Help!
If you want to go down the river to Aunt Carolyn,
I'll drive you there in the morning.
- I can hitch.
- I'll drive you there.
Now, everybody get some sleep.
Come along, you.
Come on, you.
Good night, David.
- Good night, Roberto.
- Good night, Cinzia.
So, you are leaving in the morning?
He doesn't care.
Who dived in for you, Aunt Carolyn?
Speak to him. Ask him not to go.
That's all he is waiting for.
If he wants to, I'm not going to stop him.
I've done my best.
You are like my father.
Completely pig-headed.
- Is the right word pig-headed?
- It will do.
David is a child.
Do you know what it is for a child to be alone?
I know.
He has been terribly hurt.
He loved his mother very much.
After all this you expect him to be grown-up like you?
Grown-up, pompous and knowing everything.
Pig-headed.
All right, I'll talk to him in the morning.
In my own pig-headed way.
- A little bit pig-headed is all right.
- You ought to know.
Daddy...
When are you coming to bed?
I'll be right there, darling.
- Thank you. Good night.
- Good night.
What's going on?
How did we get out here?
Why didn't you awaken me?
My alarm-clock didn't go off.
Stop that singing, stop it.
- Tell me, what happened?
- We broke loose in the wind.
Now we're stuck or we could have floated all the way to the ocean.
We could have had one of those economy cruises to Europe.
Please, stop singing!
Why didn't you awaken me?
- What would you do?
- Well, I would have...
I don't know.
- What kind of a bird is that?
- Who cares?
I have an appointment and I can't be late.
Someone will come soon, perhaps Angelo. So we wait.
- Dolce far niente.
- That's wonderful. Dolce far niente.
- What does that mean?
- It's a saying. "How sweet to do nothing."
In America they can pull you in for that.
Poor Americans.
Is it all right?
- Look at me, I'm swimming.
- It's wonderful.
That's enough.
- Marvellous.
- You were to speak with David.
I haven't got time.
I have to get off this boat.
You have plenty of time.
You didn't cut that rope, did you?
You have got the knife.
- Come on, let's have breakfast.
- We've had breakfast.
I had bacon...
Catch anything?
I used to fish in this river when I was a kid.
What's this?
The Huckleberry Finn approach?
As a matter of fact,
I didn't know very much about it.
Messy business.
Had to get my sister to help me take them off the hook.
She enjoyed it.
Blood-thirsty little creature.
Shouldn't you have cast that out further?
Are you going to teach me how to fish too, just like everything I try to do?
Like I was a real lamebrain.
- Sorry.
- I'll pay you for the rowboat.
I'll pay you for the house, too.
Someday. I'll save up.
All right. If you want to.
- You're baiting that all wrong.
- What's wrong with it?
You don't lay it on.
You got to put it on here.
You must have worked your little sister to pieces.
That's very kind of you.
Thank you.
- How's that?
- Terrible.
- What's wrong with it?
- You just can't cast.
- All right, show me. Go ahead.
- All right.
That's pretty good.
- Wait, I think I've got something.
- Reel in. Set the hook.
Come on, reel in.
Don't reel in so fast, you'll lose him.
- It must be a big one.
- It sure looks it.
Take it off.
Here! Here, give it to me.
You don't even know how to take a fish off the hook.
Everything I try to do, every little thing.
- Sometimes you gotta.
- I guess sometimes you "gotta".
I think the striped perch is the prettiest thing there is.
I think it's practically a shame to catch it.
Look at it. It's dead already.
Why does everything have to die?
For the same reason that everything has to live.
That's what I get from my teachers.
Double talk.
Think what the world would be like if nothing ever died.
There would be no room for the new and beautiful that's being born.
I'm not making room for anyone.
Let them come and get me.
That's encouraging.
You sound as if you enjoy living.
It's better than nothing.
I have to die some day, probably a long time before you.
- It doesn't bother me much.
- Who are you making room for?
It might be another William Shakespeare or a George Washington.
Or even a lamebrain like you.
But I prefer to think that no one ever really leaves.
When you're dead, you're dead.
Take another look at that fish.
I can see there is more than one pig-headed member of this family.
Let me try to explain it to you.
Here, hold on.
See this pitcher?
Try to think of this pitcher as being me.
My body.
The pitcher has no use at all except as a container for something.
In this case it contains water which you can think of as my life force.
- Try to lose that.
- OK.
- Got it?
- It's easy.
There.
The only thing is it isn't lost.
It's part of the whole river.
It's still in the universe.
- You haven't lost it. Get rid of it.
- What about this?
Look out.
What about it?
I get the idea.
It will evaporate, become a cloud and come down someplace else as rain.
- That's pretty clever of you.
- I guess you can't lose anything.
You're right.
Probably not even life itself.
It's just that everything is constantly changing.
Perhaps when our life force, our souls, leave our bodies, we go back into God's universe in the security of being part of all life again.
For all we know, that sort of life after death may be beautiful.
If you say so.
Pop, don't do anything beautiful for a while, will you?
- I'll try not to.
- And give up smoking.
It's bad for older people.
I'll just go in and get my orange juice.
Keep up my strength.
Hey, David.
Ahoy there.
- Grab a hold of this line.
- OK. Throw here.
I've got it.
How do you like what happened to us?
- Where's your father?
- He's inside.
That's about the fourth time this summer it's broken loose.
Where's the Italian pastry?
The Italian pastry is inside.
I found your knife the other day, you must have dropped it.
Thanks, I've been looking all over for it.
I stole it from you.
- What?
- You can tell the police if you want to.
Do you think I'm crazy?
I don't even remember where I got it from.
- Have you got that tied fast?
- Yeah.
About that rope.
I took it from your boat yesterday.
If we're going to play true confessions,
I've got about 15 years head start.
We'll have to wait for the tide.
About an hour and a half.
You're going to be late for your office.
What's the difference?
Dolce far niente.
- Paisà.
- Not yet, but I'm getting there.
It's wonderful.
It shows what can be accomplished with cheap child labour.
It's about time. Get downstairs.
We'll take the ladder.
How about you?
I'll take the steps.
I forgot to wear my blue jeans tonight.
- I love you madly.
- Good night.
We'd better hurry.
I can hear them tuning up over at the Country Club already.
Tom, I want you to know
I'm very flattered.
But, whatever got you out of your shell?
Even a hermit needs a change of scenery occasionally.
And this is very pretty scenery.
Alice knew how I felt about you all along.
- Is it all right to mention her now?
- Is it all right to mention John?
- Only with a snarl.
- I can manage a snarl for John.
It's so nice to have you back.
So very nice.
- Miss Jibson.
- Gibson.
Gibson... You have overlooked.
You're so right, "I have overlooked."
Good night, Cinzia.
Will you see that the children get to bed?
Yes, Signor Winters,
I shall out the lights in half an hour.
- You do that. You out the lights.
- It is the wrong word?
- It's charmingly the wrong word.
- I shall turn out the lights in half an hour.
Congratulations.
I bet if you really tried you could learn how to do the laundry too.
- Elizabeth is sleeping.
- Good.
I found my old English book you asked me for.
I was using it for a doorstop.
Teach me.
Why do you want to learn English?
You've got a really cute accent.
- Charming?
- Yeah, charming.
I spit on charming. Teach me!
This will be the first time for both of us.
"Adjectives and Adverbs."
Do you want to go that deep?
Yes.
"An adjective modifies a noun or a pronoun.
"An adverb modifies a verb, adjective or other adverb.
"Like cautious and cautiously."
Cautious and cautiously.
- Do you like your Aunt Carolyn?
- Sure thing, she's cool.
Your father likes her very much, doesn't he?
I suppose.
She's a lot like our mother used to be.
The way she talks and everything.
I mean, they were sisters.
Am I teaching you English or ain't I?
Yes, go on, Signor Professore.
"Poor, poorly. Great, greatly."
- Something wrong?
- What?
- Something wrong?
- No, I know this music very well.
It is most pretty.
Is that correct - most pretty?
- Very pretty.
- Thanks. Very pretty.
It's an old cornball.
"Almost In Your Arms".
In Italy we call it
"Quasi nelle tue braccia."
- How does it go in English?
- "How we are changed
"by things that seem
"so small.
"One look
"can write a book.
"One touch can say..."
"Different, differently.
Beautiful, beautifully.
"Different, differently.
Beautiful, beautifully."
- Come on, it's not that hard.
- Well, it is for me.
I haven't learned any English tonight, but I've learned one thing.
It's time for me to go home.
Go to bed, David. Good night.
Good night.
Is it all right if I sit here for a while?
I'm not sleepy.
- Sure.
- "...ly".
Surely.
- Hello there.
- Look, presents.
Why shouldn't we celebrate Christmas on the 4th of July?
One for you.
One for you and there, one for you.
- Who sir, me sir?
- Yes sir, you sir.
- No sir, not I sir.
- Who then sir?
Come in.
Are you really leaving in the morning?
Any hope of you changing your mind?
Before you go, I want you to know how grateful I am to you and...
- That's a present for you.
- For what?
For everything.
With that fine Italian hand that can't cook or do the laundry, you've managed to put a family together.
I thank you with all my heart.
- It's a dress.
- I see.
- It's unusual.
- Carolyn helped me pick it out.
Of course.
I thought it was a little gaudy with those flowers, but she thought you might prefer it that way.
Carolyn is a very knowing woman.
You are an attractive girl and you'll look well in that.
Thank you.
I've got another surprise for you.
How would you like to go to a dance tonight?
I would love to, yes.
- Angelo will pick you up at 8:00.
- Angelo?
He's been dying to take you to the Sons of Italy Ball.
I hear it's a very nice affair, so I took the liberty of accepting the invitation for you.
You've got to get out and have a good time.
You're in the United States now.
Three cheers for the red, white and blue.
Daddy, are you taking Cinzia to the dance tonight?
Not Cinzia, there are lots of dances tonight.
I'm taking Aunt Carolyn to the Country Club dance.
Is that getting to be a thing with you and her?
- How would you like me to answer that?
- Any way you want to.
Greetings, everybody.
- Is the dame ready?
- The lady is finishing dressing.
Cinzia, your date is here.
Straining at the leash.
Good evening, Mr Donatello.
Holy jumping cow.
- What a dress.
- You've certainly improved that dress.
Will you assist me?
This is the necklace my mother wore, the night my father proposed to her.
- Proposed?
- I've never had it on before.
Excuse me,
I just remembered something.
My brother is very sick, very sick.
I was bringing him these flowers.
That's what I came over to talk to you about.
My apologies, forgive me.
Shoot me.
But I'm not taking you to no dance.
Angelo. I thought we had everything arranged.
You saw that dress, she's sharp-shooting with her old lady's necklace.
There's nothing wrong about that.
She's a very nice girl, isn't she?
- And that can louse up an evening.
- What have you got against nice girls?
I have a good business, I make a nice dollar, I own my own truck.
If I want to have a good time,
I go out and have it.
A blonde one night, brunette the next.
Smorgasbord.
You like a guy who speaks plain?
Yes, I do.
Are you worried that her intentions are honourable?
It worries me sick.
I can feel myself slipping right into community property.
Go inside, you're driving me nuts.
It's a free country.
She's beautiful.
She is a delightful girl and she works very hard.
She deserves an evening out.
Cut it out, will you?
My brother once took a dame like that to the Sons of Italy Ball.
He's married.
Ever since he's been having sons of Italy all over the place.
Six kids, doctor bills.
His wife is getting fat and sloppy.
Who needs it?
You have to settle down one day.
If only from exhaustion.
I'm young yet,
I don't want to be old tomorrow.
You're beautiful and I love you.
I never want to see you again.
Extraordinary.
I've never seen a man behave so stupidly.
Haven't you?
- Ahoy. Is this ship one of ours?
- Ready for the big dance?
- Don't you want a drink first?
- Prepare to board.
- I think you've had enough, Alan.
- One teeny, weenie Martini and then we all head for the Country Club, right?
Maybe we should stay here.
This is prettier than the Country Club.
This is nice.
- Who is she?
- That's the maid.
I understand she sleeps in.
That's not very funny, Alan.
You have been asking for it.
The whole town is talking.
I love your new uniform.
What do you wear on your day off?
We have to get rid of Sadie the scrubber.
This, ladies and gentleman, is what I call a maid.
There are those who require alcohol to give them courage,
I'm not one of them.
Is it dry enough?
You think of an answer in the morning, dear.
She must be used to it by now.
You'd better get off the boat.
Carolyn, I'll take you to the Country Club in my car.
- Don't you want to go with me?
- Not until you grow up.
What do you expect people to think about the girl?
What do you think, Carolyn?
Thank you and good night, ladies and gentlemen.
Go away, whoever.
You should have pushed him in the water.
Are you crying?
Anybody does anything to you again, just let me know, no matter who.
Whom.
Who.
Who.
Why do I only have to be 13 years old?
Why do I have to be a little kid?
Otherwise I could take you to that dance.
You are my professor, not a little kid.
- Do you want to go fishing for eels?
- I can't think of anything nicer.
Maybe you can make peanut butter sandwiches, they are easy.
- No, I think I'd better make them.
- I'll make them.
I'll go and get the spears and lights and I'll meet you on the deck.
This is going to be a pretty good
4th of July after all.
Cinzia, I think I should apologise for the behaviour of the upper classes in America.
They behave like the upper classes in Italy.
Also the lower classes.
Would you help me with...
This stud is stuck here.
Thank you.
Cinzia, would you do me a favour?
Will you do me the honour of accompanying me to the dance tonight?
- Me? I?
- Yes.
- With you?
- Me... I.
Of course, yes, thank you.
- I should have asked you, do you dance?
- We are quite advanced in Italy.
- Do you feel better?
- We'll get you some solid food.
There are quite a few stuffy people at some of these dances.
- Would you prefer to go somewhere else?
- They are not the only stuffy people.
- Would you prefer to go somewhere else?
- No.
I'm certain you wouldn't do anything to embarrass me.
Or would you?
- Thank you very much.
- Yes, she would do.
The evening is starting out fine,
I can see that.
Don't be confused.
No, I've sworn off.
I'm only taking that stuff externally now.
My compliments to you.
Don't report that to the union.
I've sobered up a little and would like to apologise.
May I say that if everyone brought their maids instead of their wives,
- I'd pay up my back dues.
- You may say that.
Am I forgiven enough to have this dance?
- Would it embarrass you?
- I've gone past that.
Hello. They've got quite a buffet.
Would you care to come over and watch me eat crow?
- Hello, Carolyn.
- Won't you dance with me?
Of course.
Tom, I'm sorry.
I'll go away and I'll vanish into thin air if you just tell me, are you in love with her?
Cinzia?
She is David's girl.
If you were in love with her, would you know you were in love with her?
It's just that I've waited so long.
Since I was four years old.
Then my sister beat me to it.
Would you care if we didn't dance any more?
- Am I stepping on your toes?
- All my life, mister. All my life.
Tom, if you don't marry me, you're likely to do something foolish.
I know.
You don't take a girl out of another world and try to make her part of yours.
You may try, but you just don't.
If it didn't work out, the children would be in worse shape than ever.
They would be rowing across the river in squadrons.
Why don't you take an oar, too?
I swore that one tried marriage was enough, but perhaps it's time to reconsider.
Because the children like me?
Not only that, there are times you bring out the beast in me.
Likewise, Tom.
I know you are not madly in love with me, but maybe that would come in time.
Are you willing to take me on that basis?
On any basis, Tom.
That's how the mighty have fallen.
Thank you very much.
I'm delighted you are the belle of the ball, but may I have this dance?
I believe that I am the fellow that brought you.
Yes, you are the stuffy one.
It's a lovely evening.
Thank you so much for bringing me.
There is something I should tell you.
Yes?
What?
What?
There is something you wish to tell me?
There is?
How have you been, Tom?
Hey, Tom.
Carolyn just told us the good news.
Congratulations.
- How much for the houseboat?
- They will live on it after they are married.
- For this, I'm going off the wagon.
- That's a short trip.
Married?
That was what I was about to tell you.
Do me the honour to go straight to hell.
If I don't say it right, I don't care.
Tom, what's the matter?
Carolyn, I've been terribly stupid.
I'm sorry. Since you were four years old, I'm sorry.
Good morning.
Well, somebody say something.
"The morning's at 7:00,
God is in heaven,
"all is right with the world."
That is correct?
- I've given up teaching.
- There is much yet for me to learn.
- You learn pretty fast.
- I don't think I want any breakfast.
At least one thing I've learned.
I can make boiled eggs and cereal.
I just pour in milk and it goes crack, pop and snap.
Even I cannot spoil it.
Is your father awake?
No, he's sleeping.
I poked him a few times, but he's still sleeping.
He must have been crock.
If it's all right with you, can I have my English book back?
I'm the dumbest one in the class.
- I'd better start to study.
- All right.
I'm going to get some air.
David, I am not leaving today.
Perhaps later we can go fishing together?
You don't want to go fishing with me,
I'm just a kid.
I bet you think you're beautiful.
Well, you're not.
You're ugly.
You're the ugliest old girl I ever saw.
Roberto, eat your breakfast.
I don't want to.
Did you kiss him?
- Who?
- Daddy.
Yes, I did.
- That's what David said.
- Did he kiss you?
Yes, he kissed me.
I want to tell you something.
- I'm in love with your father.
- He loves you?
I believe so. I hope so.
I want you to know something.
We might get married.
Would that make you our mother?
I would be most happy to be your father's wife and your mother.
You can't be our mother.
You are our friend.
One can be a friend and a mother.
Of course, it's most unusual.
You can't be our mother.
You don't look like our mother.
You can't even cook an egg.
What kind of a mother are you?
- Roberto.
- Don't call me any Italian name.
My mother is dead!
I'm very sorry.
I don't mean to take her place.
Perhaps you can explain to Roberto later.
He wouldn't listen.
He'll just get that harmonica and he won't listen to anybody.
I don't think I can eat either.
- Listen. About married people.
- What?
Do they sleep in the same bed together?
In America, sometimes.
In Italy, always.
Would it matter if I slept with you?
No, it would be all right.
- But not all the time.
- Why not? I don't take up much room.
It has something to do with married people.
I guess he likes you better than he likes me.
Why do you talk like that?
Yes, he does.
He didn't even want me in there when it was lightning and I was afraid.
I hate him.
You go ahead, see if I care.
He pulls the covers off me anyway.
I got you a stateroom on the Constitution leaving New York the day after tomorrow.
- Will you jump over board?
- I've had my adventure.
I've learned many things.
Including how difficult it is to be a father.
It wasn't easy to cancel the rest of my tour and come back.
- Is it all right?
- Just perfect.
We'll go to Como together.
A vacation.
Then there's a concert at La Scala.
What an ovation we'll get.
- You will get.
- I will get.
Are you expecting somebody?
- Yes?
- I'm looking for Miss Cinzia Zaccardi.
She's not in.
Seven years old?
You left some dirty dishes in the sink.
Sorry, it was a lovely interlude.
I enjoyed every minute of it.
Until we both had too much champagne and spoilt it all.
- It was just an interlude?
- Yes.
For one who has had so much experience lying, you're not doing very well now.
I talked to the children after I got your note.
I would like you to meet my father.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
- I love you very much.
- Some tea?
- You are in love with me. Aren't you?
- It's excellent tea, I didn't make it.
- One lump or two?
- You stay out of this.
Your children are your friends again.
- That is the most important thing.
- It is more important to be their father.
I have my life and my father and I have finally come to understand him.
You know you are very beautiful.
Have I told you that before?
You are really quite beautiful.
No, I am an ugly old girl.
Please go away.
I guess she wasn't in after all.
Come here.
Cinzia, come out here.
I can lock her in her room.
I can take her to Italy.
The only way I can keep her is to let her go away.
I'm too old to run after her any more.
It's your turn.
A terrible time she'll give you.
Come out here at once!
If you do one thing ever to hurt her, or make her cry,
I'll have your heart cut out.
If I have to go to the Mafia.
- She doesn't want me.
- Zaccardi knows what she wants.
- I saw him over there.
- Come on down.
We aren't going to their wedding either, but you'd better get inside.
No, I'm going to stay up here all night and freeze.
- It's too warm to freeze.
- You're just a girl.
- OK. Come on down.
- All right.
- Are you ready?
- Almost.
Did you speak to the children?
Yes. They are being very pig-headed.
I don't know where they get it from.
- Please, try again.
- All right.
Thank you.
Aren't you going to get dressed?
I know how you feel, but nothing ever stays exactly the same.
Everything changes.
Everybody has to leave everybody sooner or later.
It's not so bad.
It's different, but not so bad.
You will all be leaving me before long and I have to get used to that.
You can't remain children forever.
- No matter how much you want to.
- Why do you talk so much?
Because you make me feel guilty.
Why should I feel guilty?
You are the ones.
Why don't you cry or something?
Then I'd feel better.
Won't you please come to my wedding?
Cinzia would like it.
Why do I talk so much?
Would you both kneel, please?
We are gathered together here to join this man and this woman in bonds of matrimony, in the presence of God and these witnesses and by virtue of authority vested in me by the laws of this state.
If any of you know any reason why these two should not be thus joined, speak now or forever hold your peace.
Will you take her hand, please?
Do you, Thomas Winters, take this woman for your lawful and wedded wife?
That's you, sir.
Who sir, me sir?
Yes sir, you sir.
I do.
Will you love, honour, cherish, keep her in sickness and in health, forsaking all others so long as you both shall live?
I will.
- Do you take this man as your husband?
- I do.

Come in, Mrs. Sugrue.
Katie, darlin'.
Can you lend me the loan of a small pinch of tea?
I'll pay you back Thursday.
You can have it and welcome.
I knew you wouldn't refuse old Sheelah, and I knew you'd have rations and leavings, for there's little that's lacking here, unless 'twould be a man to cook for.
I have me father to cook for.
So you do, so you do, but I meant a man of your own.
- Time enough for that.
- "Time enough" lost the ducks.
There's many a lass that lost her market from waiting too long.
Oh, you can smile now, but who in this town would have you?
- Am I that bad?
- You miss the meaning.
There's not a man doesn't want you, but who among them dare look at you with the grand house you live in?
A fine situation your father has with his lordship.
Take my son Pony.
He don't dare raise his eyes to you, and him the catch of the town.
Now, I would have said that Pony thought no small beer of himself.
Oh, he's proud.
He's proud as a white-washed pig, but he needs encouragement from you.
You should be looking ahead, Katie.
Your father is getting no younger, and when the time comes that he must step down... who else will there be but Pony
Sugrue who can take his place?
Don't put me father in his grave just yet.
Oh, the saints forbid.
He'll be spared for many years,
God willin'.
[Skipped item nr. 32]
(hoofbeats)
That must be Pony now.
No, it's not.
Merciful heavens!
It's Lord Fitzpatrick himself.
Hello, Katie.
Your Lordship, why didn't you tell us you were coming?
I'd have opened the manor house for you.
I'll not be stopping here long enough for that.
Where's your father?
Well, now, let me see.
Um...
I heard him sayin', um, something about cuttin' the weeds around the summer house.
I think he'll have gone to have the smithy sharpen his scythe.
- I'll fetch him for you, Your Lordship.
- Well, that's good of you.
That Katie's a grand girl.
Almost makes up for her father.
- What ails him?
- Oh, nothing at all, but he retired about five years ago, didn't tell me about it.
He'll be down at the inn now, telling stories.
Well, let's go and have a look at the gatehouse.
Oh, I didn't know anybody was here.
I'm the Widow Sugrue,
Your Lordship.
- I often comes in to help.
- I see.
Begging Your Lordship's pardon,
I'm the mother of Pony Sugrue.
He drives the mail cart to Cahersiveen whenever the train comes in.
I'm very glad to hear it.
He's a fine strong lad.
He's worthy of greater things.
- Is he, now?
- Aye, he is indeed.
You'll never hear me speak a word against Darby O'Gill, but he's gettin' on.
When the time comes for you to hire a younger man, give a thought to m'lad Pony.
I'm not sure I want a man who is too well known to the town.
A man from outside would be more respected.
My Pony is respected and feared, too.
He's whipped every man in the parish.
Is that so?
Thank you. Thank you.
If it were Pony you had in charge of this place, he wouldn't let it fall to wrack and ruin whilst he sat in the pub telling stories.
Well, I'll tell you, the first look
I got at him was in the old ruins
- on the top of Knocknasheega.
- And what did he look like, Darby?
Ah, just like any other leprechaun, only he, being king of them all, had a little gold crown on his head.
Tell me something, Darby.
Did he have a long tail and a cloven hoof?
Now, whoever heard of a leprechaun havin' a...
(laughter)
You don't have to listen if you don't want to, Pony, but you needn't make fun of those who do.
But I do.
I want to listen.
I want to learn all about them.
Here, Molly, give me another large one, and then maybe I can see a leprechaun, too.
You'll get no more whiskey here today, but if you care to be sociable, you can have a glass of stout.
I ordered whiskey, and devil a foot will I stir from here until I get it.
Pony Sugrue, you're bloom old and for want of a beatin', and if I were 10 years younger,
I'd give it to you.
Ah, but you're... you're not
10 years younger, are you?
No, I'm not, but this is my place, and while you're in the Rathcullen
Arms, you'll sit quietly, or I'll have Father Murphy forbid you to come here at all.
All right, I'll have the stout.
You were sayin', Darby?
I was sayin' this wasn't like any old leprechaun that you wouldn't say hello twice to.
But who was he... but Brian Connors himself, the king of them all.
But I got me eye fixed on him.
They can't escape, you know, as long as you don't look away.
Now, the night was dark and the mountain was covered with mist, and the moon was no bigger than the light from a wee penny candle, but it didn't hide him from me... for there he stood, with an angry little gob on him and his face as fierce as fire.
King Brian, me old boyo,
I've got you at last, and I'm not gonna let you go until you grant me the favor of three grand wishes.
Wait now, wait now, maybe we can talk this over.
- Will you have a pinch of snuff?
- Aye, and you'll blow it into me eyes.
I'm up to all your dirty little tricks.
You've gone too far. You'll get no wishes from me at all, now.
You'll either give them to me, or else you'll answer to the Church.
I'll have Father Murphy curse you with a blessin' that'll shrivel you up in a minute.
All right, then, wish your wishes and be done with it.
I've work to do at home.
- Ah, don't rush me.
- Don't rush you? Huh.
Mean to say you're not gonna wish for a crock of gold?
I may in due time, but what's gold to a man if he be too sick or too sad to enjoy it?
Ah, you're the thinkin' man.
I am, and me first wish is you'll grant me health.
- Granted.
- Now, me second wish is a small wish indeed, but it means a lot to me.
- I want a big crop of potatoes.
- Granted.
And me third wish is for the crock of gold.
Granted.
Now, what about your fourth wish?
Me fourth wish?
Try me.
You'll find I'm a generous man.
Then I'll be a generous man.
I'd like a crock of gold like this for me good friend Tom Kerrigan and another one for that decent man Pat Scanlon and another one for that doorful of a woman, Molly Malloy.
- Is that your fourth wish?
- It is.
(laughing)
Three wishes I'll grant you, great wishes or small, but you'll wish a fourth one, and you'll lose them all!
(laughing)
Wasn't I the fool of the world, lettin' him trick me into the fourth wish, and me knowin' better.
Ah, dear, dear, and we could all have been as rich as Midas himself.
- A whole crock of gold for me.
- The devil's gold.
I wouldn't touch it if Father Murphy blessed every coin.
Stay away from Knocknasheega, Darby.
You moil and meddle with that little king, he'll put the come-hither on you and make you his slave forevermore.
Do you think I'm a babe in arms?
You are to the likes of him.
5,000 years old, he is, and every year of his life he's learned a new trick.
And I've learned 100 of them.
You're mad, mind you. You'll be caught like a rat in a snap trap.
Now, I don't want your blood on my head, so don't wish any gold for me.
I'll leave your share to the Church, Paddy,
(laughs) but I won't let Father Murphy know where I got it.
- No, no.
- (laughter)
(Father Murphy)
God save all here.
We didn't see you, Father.
I didn't want to interrupt.
I just dropped in to tell you the news.
My friend Father O'Leary in the town of Glencove has a new bell that was given to him by Lord Bellinbergh, and he has presented the old one to us.
- Ah, that's grand, Father.
- Glory be.
There'll be a chapel bell in our tower at last.
All we have to do is to go after it.
Now, if I had a horse, which I haven't,
I'd go for it meself, which I won't, but I thought perhaps there might be somebody here with a horse and cart who'd like to go for the bell.
How much would that somebody be paid, Father?
Paid?
I suppose we might be able to scratch up two pounds.
Now, I would've said it was worth two pounds, 10, if it was worth a bob.
Like enough it's worth three pounds, but since we're a poor parish,
I thought perhaps you might like to take out the difference in the credit to your soul.
Two pounds, 10, Father.
Why, my goodness me, a deed like that might even absolve a man from the sin of using the priest and the Church against the powers of darkness for his own selfish ends.
I'll do it, Father.
I'll do it for nothing.
No. As a reward, you may have the music of the bell.
- The music of the bell for me?
- Yes, and for your seed, breed and generation till the end of time.
It's a bargain, Father.
I'll do it in the morning.
Father!
Savin' your presence, Father Murphy, but he's needed at the house.
Excuse me, Your Reverence.
- Fitzpatrick himself...
- Don't worry about me, girl.
I'll get back.
I'm coming now.
What are you after doin' pulling me out, with Father Murphy lookin' at us, neither?
I can't afford an army of caretakers for the little use I have of the place, but I don't like to see the weeds higher than the summer house.
Someone's after poaching rabbits.
Ah, that's a thing
I want you to put a stop to.
Old Darby couldn't catch a poacher if he tried.
Like enough he helped to set the snare.
Now, I don't want any bad feeling between the townspeople and me.
I like 'em, mind you, and so will you,
- but don't like 'em too much.
- No, sir. No poachers.
Well, well, well, sir.
I never thought I'd have the pleasure of seeing Your Lordship so soon.
Yes, it looks as if you weren't quite ready for me.
One more day, and I'll have the whole place beautified.
Darby, this is Michael MacBride, a Dublin man.
I've decided to settle him here in your place.
I know it sounds sudden, but I've had it in mind for some time.
You've served me well, Darby, but we need a younger man here.
When a man gets along in years, he shouldn't have to work so hard, so I'm going to retire you on half pay, let you have the old McCarthy cottage rent-free for the rest of your days.
And leave the gatehouse?
It's become our home.
Well, so will the other in time.
- I don't think Katie will take to this.
- We'll give it a new thatch.
But what am I going to do with meself, and me cut off in me prime?
You'll be telling stories at the public house all day, and poaching rabbits by night.
Holy old Finbar!
What with the foxes eatin' the grouse, don't tell me I set a snare down a rabbit hole.
You're an old fox yourself, Darby, but, faith, I'm fond of you and Katie, too.
Whenever we have to open up the manor house, she can have first call with the cleaning.
Pardon me, sir, but when have we got to leave the gatehouse?
Can we give them another two weeks?
Longer than that, sir, as far as I'm concerned.
Good. Then tonight, when you finish today's work here, you tell Tom Kerrigan to let you have a room at the Rathcullen Arms.
Please, sir, I'd be grateful if you wouldn't mention it to Katie.
I want to break the news to her meself.
Very well, but remember I said two weeks, Darby, not two years.
When I return here on Monday week,
I want you out and Michael in and everything settled and done.
Yes, sir.
Good day, Your Lordship!
Well, goodbye, Mr. O'Gill.
Now here, wouldn't it be a shame to put his lordship to the expense of a room in the pub and Katie and me fair rockin' around in the gatehouse?
That's very kind of you, but I don't think his lordship would like it.
Why wouldn't he? Sure I can instruct you on your new duties. Katie!
Yes, Father?
- This is Mister, uh...
- MacBride.
Mr. MacBride is comin' to stay with us for a while, so throw some extra spuds in the pot for supper and make up the bed in the loft.
If it's any trouble, I can go to the inn.
It's no trouble at all.
Pony!
- Come with me.
- What's up with you now?
I want you outside where his lordship can have a look at you.
Why should he want a look at me?
'Cause you're going to be a consequential man and have Darby's fine position as his lordship's caretaker and Katie O'Gill for your wife.
Huh, and when the sky falls, we'll all catch larks.
I mean it, Pony. I had a talk with his lordship about you, and I tell you it's only a matter of time.
I put a flea in Katie's ear, too.
I wouldn't worry about her.
With a fine situation like that,
I could have me choice of girls.
Katie might help you get it.
- Maybe you're right.
- Here he comes.
Smile, me darling.
Smile.
This is m'lad Pony, Your Lordship, the one I told you about.
Your servant, sir.
Well, he's a big man, isn't he, now?
Nice to meet you, Pony.
(clears throat)
"A big man," says he.
What did I tell you?
You'll get the job in no time at all.
Ah, Katie, you should have saw the turf the two of us cut this afternoon.
That was a grand bit of work you done. So it was, aye.
His lordship thought I could use a lad to help with the turf before the rains came.
And me doin' 10 men's work already.
Come, lad, sit down.
Take the air of the fire, and I'll play you a tune while the pot's on the boil.
(# plucks strings)
Ah, that's good.
(# playing lively tune)
- Can you put a name to that?
- Hmm? Uh, no, it's... it's new to me.
What's it called?
Them as I heard it from give it no name.
Well, where did you hear it?
In the old ruins on the top of Knocknasheega, and there were the little people dancing all around in the moonlight.
Well, aren't they the bold creatures?
Aye, they are.
Supper's ready.
Bold and cunning, they are, but I'm up to them.
Once I caught King Brian himself, and he gave me the gold, though I'd no need for it.
But, faith, I have need for it now.
Shh.
(whispers)
Don't breathe a word.
Tomorrow at dawn I've got to go to Glencove to bring back a bell for the chapel.
I'll have to round up the horse, now, before she runs all over the mountainside.
I'll be glad to give you a hand.
I was just going to ask you to go the rounds of the manor house and try all the doors and the windows.
Right so, but after that, I think I'll go down to the Rathcullen Arms and see about a room.
Now, why would you be doin' that?
I don't like to take hospitality under false pretenses, and besides, two weeks from today, you must leave here.
- I think your daughter should know.
- Oh, she will, she will.
Then why let her believe that I was brought here only for the cuttin' of the turf?
You see, she was born in the gatehouse, and for 20 years, she's lived in it.
It gives us a standin' in the town.
No, I'll tell her when the time comes.
I can't break it out of a clear sky like a crack of thunder.
Well, when will you tell her?
- The first good chance I get.
- Then do it soon.
I'll tell her, I'll tell her.
Here, I'm used to the dark.
- Watch out for poachers.
- I'll do that.
Come on now, Cleopatra.
Wait now, darlin'.
Devil take you!
Come back here!
Come back to your master.
Wait till I catch you.
Cleopatra, come on, now.
Cleopatra, where are you?
I'm lookin' for you.
Can't you hear me?
Cleopatra.
Ah, there you are.
What do you think you're doin'?
Hop out of that.
Do you want to break a leg?
Whoa! Whoa, there.
Whoa! Whoa, I tell you.
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa, there.
Whoa!
Get down! Whoa!
- (neighing)
- Get down!
(screaming)
- So that's Darby O'Gill, is it?
- Aye, it is.
I wonder why his honor put the come-hither on the likes of that.
Sure there's no more life in him than a potato vine after a frost.
Well, either he's hard asleep or he's killed entirely.
Let's find out.
(grunts)
You murderin' little heathens!
- Watch your stick.
- Oh! Hey! Get off me!
Wait, wait.
Hey! Ooh!
(laughing)
(grunting, groaning)
Come on, you blackguard, now we'll take you to the king.
There's no tellin' what he'll do to you.
No tellin' indeed.
(laughs)
(# bagpipes and drums playing)
- Come on.
- Hurry up!
Darby O'Gill is here.
He's come.
(music stops)
Come in, man.
Come in.
All right,
Your Royal Highness.
Well, Darby O'Gill, 'tis pleased and delighted I am to see you again.
Thank you, sir.
It's a grand place you got here.
Ah, it does well enough.
Sit down, man.
Over there.
Drop the lid, man.
It's only an old chest full of jewels.
We took it from the Spanish ships when the Armada
- was wrecked on our coast.
- Is that so?
Ship's gun, too.
Oh, that's a fine piece.
- It is indeed.
- And the throne?
By all the goats in Kerry, do you think I'd sit on a Spanish throne?
This once belonged to Fergus mac Leda, ancient high king of all Ireland.
- Do you say so?
- I do.
And over there, the gold cup of Cormac.
And here's the sword of Brian Boru, who drove out the Danes.
And over there you see the harp.
Don't tell me it's "the harp that once through Tara's Hall the soul of music shed."
Aye, it is that same.
I declare to me soul, when I tell them this down in the pub, they won't believe a word of it.
Ah, you can't do that, Darby.
Once you're here, there's no going back.
I've got to get back to Katie.
Ah, you needn't worry about Katie.
She'll give you a grand wake, and then she'll forget all about you.
- Mind what you say about Katie.
- Calm yourself, now. Calm yourself!
- What have I ever done to you?
- Nothin', Darby.
- Who tells all the stories about you?
- You do, Darby.
Aye, and who makes the women watch where they're throwin' their wash water when you and your lads are out walkin' invisible?
You do, Darby.
And who makes the men tip their hats respectful to every swirl of dust?
You.
You've done grand.
So you put the come-hither on me.
That's how you pay me back, you ungrateful little frainey.
Your heart's as cold as a wet Christmas.
(shouting)
Blackguard!
They better watch what they're saying. I speak Gaelic, too.
- Now, you listen to me.
- No, you listen to me.
Phadrig Oge was standing under the white thorn tree by the summer house when his lordship gave you the bad news today, and the moment
I heard you were in trouble,
I swore I'd take you out of it.
If you're the fine, decent man
I think you are, you'll be showin' me a little bit of gratitude.
I am grateful.
Then you can say goodbye to the tears and the troubles of the world outside. There's nothin' but fun and diversion here.
Now, what'll you do first, Darby?
- Well, I don't know.
- Would you care to play the harp?
No, I'm no great hand with the harp... but give me me old fiddle, and I'll play you a tune
- worth goin' a mile o' ground to hear.
- Grand.
Now, if someone will show me the way out, I'll go home for it.
None of your tricks, Darby.
I said you were here to stay.
Phadrig Oge!
- Yes, Your Highness?
- Fetch the Stradivarius.
Right away, Your Highness.
It was presented to me by the emperor of the Italian fairies in 1700.
It's a Stradivarius.
I'd rather have me own.
Ah, you'll have to make do with this one.
Go ahead, man.
Try it.
All right, then, if it makes you happy.
(# playing sad tune)
- Now give us a good one.
- All right, then.
Me grandfather Podge told me there were three things the little people were mad after:
Dancin', whiskey and huntin'.
Begorra!
He wasn't far wrong.
Then I'll give you the fox chase.
- (crowd murmuring)
- Ah, the fox chase.
First you'll hear the gathering of the huntsmen
- and the bayin' of the hounds.
- Grand.
Away we go.
(# playing lively tune)
(# playing faster)
(# playing faster)
(# playing faster)
(laughing)
Ooh!
(horn sounding)
Gone away!
(laughing)
Give us full cry!
(laughing)
(King Brian) A-ridling!
Oscul!
A-ridling!
Wait!
Wait, Your Highness. Wait!
(whinnies)
Whose side are you on, anyway?
You'll find out who's the knowledgeable one.
Come on, now.
Oh, it's not for me.
I'm expectin' company.
If I can only hold him here till cockcrow, you'll see what'll happen to your friend when daylight comes. Aye.
(door banging)
And... And how was the chase, hm?
We were chasin' the wrong fox, but I've run you to earth at last.
What do you mean, sir?
- I've a good mind to break your back!
- I thought we were friends.
You've made a laughingstock of me in front of my own people!
- I don't understand.
- When his lordship kicked you out,
- who took you in?
- You did.
And what did you do the minute my back was turned?
Oh, I-I just went back for me pipe.
You didn't think I wanted to stay here, did you?
How could any man who's had one look inside the fairy mountain be content with anything else?
Faith, I never saw dancin' so fine or heard pipin' so shockin' sweet or touched a fiddle so grand, and never in me wildest dreams did I dream I'd be sittin' on diamonds.
No, indeed.
All I want from here is me old duidin.
Well, you better make sure.
We can't have you goin' in and out.
No, not a thing else.
- I'll not even be needin' this.
- And what might that be, now?
It's a drop of old poteen
I found in the bog.
Oh, it has a real smack to it.
I'd offer you a drop, only it wouldn't be fine enough for Your Royal Highness.
Let me be the judge of that.
Well, very good,
Your Royal Highness.
Well, here goes.
Ahh.
It drinks cool and easy, so it does.
I'm plenty glad you like it.
Now we'd better be on our way.
I can't wait to get back to all that music and fun and diversion.
Now, just a minute.
We've a fine bit of diversion right here.
Sit down now and have one with me for friendship's sake.
Well, if you insist,
Your Royal Highness...
- I'll join you.
- Good man, yourself, and if it's music you're after, what about a song?
- A song?
- Aye.
- Do you know the "Wishing Song"?
- I do not.
Oh, we better not try it, then.
You have to make it up as you go.
(laughs) I can make up a thousand songs, so I can.
Can you?
- Of course I can.
- All right, then.
The "Wishing Song."
# Oh, I wish I had time to sing you a song
# But when I get started,
I sing all night long
- (laughs)
- Ha.
Can you put a rhyme to that?
- Try me.
- Go on, then.
# Oh, singin's no sin and drinkin's no crime
# If you have one drink only, just one at a time
(Darby laughs)
# Oh, I wish all the rhymers were like Brian Connors
# When it comes to rhymin', he takes all the honors
(Darby laughs)
(laughing)
- Can you beat that?
- Hold your whisht.
# Oh, I knew you could sing when you opened your mug
# So you carry the tune and I'll carry the jug
That's a good one.
Could we have another round?
- There's nothin' stoppin' us.
- Good.
# Oh, I wish all barmaids
# Were like Mary McCluskey
"McCluskey"?
# When she served you a drink
# Why, she served you good "whuskey"
(laughing)
Oh, that's a thunderin' good rhyme,
"McCluskey" and "whuskey."
Did you ever hear the like of it?
# But Mary, she married poor Jimmy McQueen
# 'Cause she wanted her name to rhyme with "poteen"
- Oh, I've got a good one.
- So have I.
# Oh, I wish I was married to old Widow Tunney
# She's ugly as sin but has beautiful money
- Slainte, lad.
- Slainte go saol agat.
(laughing)
(groaning)
(both continue laughing)
(snores)
(# King hums the "Wishing Song")
How many verses have we sung?
- Well, here's the 80th for you.
# Oh, I wish that all mortals were like my friend Darby
# He's full of poteen, but he's fuller of blarney
(laughing)
- That's a tough one.
- (King laughs)
- Well, here's 81.
- Ha! Ha! Ugh!
# I wish all the gentry were like the King Brian
# If he can't beat ya drinkin',
# He'll fall down a-tryin'#
(both laughing)
(roostercrows)
(laughing)
Good mornin', me old bucko.
(laughing)
Open your door.
Can you not go through it anymore?
Try again.
Would you violate the sacred rites of hospitality?
I would.
How would you like to have me put a lump on your back?
I know you can't work your charms in the daytime, and when you couldn't go through that door, I knew I had you.
You murderin', deceitful, blind-staggerin' old truaillidh moran!
When me strength comes back in the nighttime,
I'll put an elephant's head on you and have you crawl on all fours and eat grass that won't nourish you
- till you shrivel up and die!
- Whoo-hoo, hullabaloo!
(cat meows)
Ah, good mornin', Ginger.
Have you come for your breakfast?
Well, there's a tasty morsel
I've no further use for.
Don't let him loose.
Don't let him loose!
Shrivel him up.
Put a hump in his back.
Have mercy, Darby.
Spare me and I'll grant you your three wishes all over again!
Do you hear that, Ginger?
Now, go on, wish them.
Sure now, I might wish for the crock of gold.
- Go on!
- Or I might wish for... let's see...
- Long life.
- Yes.
Or I might wish for a carriage and pair.
- Granted. Granted.
- (Ginger meowing)
Granted!
But I haven't wished a wish yet.
I said I might.
Get on with it, then.
Wish your wishes, and since we've had such a grand night of it, you can have as many as you like.
So that's good of you.
"Three wishes I'll grant you, big wishes and small, but if you wish a fourth, you'll get none at all."
(laughing)
Ah, what a memory you've got, you wicked old scut.
(laughing)
But before I make a wish,
I'll have to talk with Katie.
- I'll make one.
- Go on, go on.
One wish to protect the other two.
Now, me first wish is that you will not fly back to Knocknasheega, but you'll be at my beck and call for a fortnight at least, until I make the other two wishes.
You thief of the world.
Never in 1,000 years has a man taken such an underhanded advantage.
Faith, never in 5,000 years have you ever met a more knowledgeable adversary.
I am Brian of Knocknasheega, and never...
No! No!
Do you agree to the terms of the first wish?
I do, I do!
All right, then.
Go on, Ginger.
But how am I gonna protect myself while you're makin' up your mind?
Now, don't worry.
I'll take good care of you.
Aah!
No, no, no, you wicked old devil.
You murderin' old hypocrite!
Let me go! Let me out!
(muffled)
Let me out, do you hear me?
Now, what would she be doin' around here?
Always scroogin' round to the back door, beggin' something, borrowin' tea or something.
- Morning.
- Good morning.
- Did you sleep well?
- That I did, thank you.
Where's Darby?
His bed hasn't been slept in, but he'll turn up.
I gathered from something he said last night that he might capture the leprechaun.
- He has great games with them.
- When he's taken a draft too many?
He's not a drinkin' man.
But he's a lonely man since me mother died.
When he goes to the pub, it's for company, and when he makes his rounds at night, the wee folk give him sport.
Well, what about yourself?
Don't you get lonely?
I keep busy.
Rathcullen's a small, little place, but there are dances and hostings aplenty.
There's a dance on tonight.
Maybe you'd care to go,
Mr. MacBride?
No, not yet, thank you.
And, uh, by the way, my name is Michael.
Well, so it is, but until I've known you more than a day, your name is Mr. MacBride...
Mr. MacBride.
What was old Sheelah doin' around here?
She dropped in to pay back a pinch of tea.
Well, I don't like to see her about the place.
- Father, sit down and eat.
- She and her son Pony, they're two of a kind, neither of them up to any good.
She's only a poor old woman.
Old woman indeed.
Are you wearin' your holy medal?
- I am.
- Well, don't leave it off.
- She could be a witch.
- You'd better go to bed.
I can't. I got to go to Glencove to pick up a bell for Father Murphy.
'Tis a shame I'll not be here today to help you.
Oh, we can't let the cutting of the turf stand in the way of good deeds.
Well, me boy, seein' it's for one day only, could you leave the turf and cut the weeds around the summer house?
- I think I could.
- And, listen, if you make a good job of it,
I might keep you on.
How would you like workin' for me, anyway?
Why would he want to work for you?
You haven't one shilling to rub against the other.
Katie, me dear, there's been a change in our fortunes for the better.
I'm thinkin' of buyin' the manor house for meself and shiftin' you out of here into surroundin's more in keepin' with your charm and beauty.
Well, I wouldn't want to live in the manor house.
You know as well as I do, his lordship would never sell it.
What do you want?
You've only got to name it.
I don't want anything.
Now, sit down.
I suppose you don't want to hear about the great battle
I fought with the powers of darkness.
I do not.
Now, sit down and eat your stirabout.
She should be the caretaker.
She's got a tongue would clip a hedge.
(Michael) # Have you ever seen the sea gulls
# A- flyin' o'er the heather
# Or the crimson sails in Galway Bay
# The fishermen unfurl
# Oh, the earth is filled with beauty
# And it's gathered all together
# In the form and face and dainty grace
# Of a pretty Irish girl
# Oh, she is my dear my darlin' one
# Her eyes so sparklin' full of fun
# No other, no other can match the likes of her
# She is my dear my darlin' one
# My smilin' and beguilin' one
# I love the ground she walks upon
# My darling Irish girl
I called you when your food was ready, but you were makin' so much noise, you couldn't hear me.
Faith, I know I can't sing a lick, but when I'm roarin' like Doran's bull, it works up a killin' hunger in me.
What have we got here?
Bread newly baked, butter fresh from the churn, and boiled eggs and ham.
Well, now, aren't you the clever girl?
You have enough here to feed the parish.
I thought you'd be hungry.
- I hope the bread has cooled.
- Oh, I like it hot.
Mile murder! Did no one ever tell you the hazard of hot bread?
No, they didn't, ah...
Sure you can see I need someone to watch over me.
Did your father say anything this morning before he left?
He said he would be back by sundown.
Nothin' about me?
- He said you were a good lad.
- That's all?
- Isn't that enough?
- I suppose it is.
Tell me, Katie, do you think I'm a good lad?
I very greatly doubt it.
(bell chiming)
(cheering)
Aye, you look fine, Darby!
Hey, all right!
It's a grand bell.
You've done a great deed.
Thank you, Father.
Thank you, Father.
Darby!
- What have you got in the bag?
- Well, uh, Father, it would be a hard thing to explain.
Oh, now, you could try.
Well, like, it's a kind of financial venture, you might say.
A financial venture that you'd be afraid to tell your priest about?
Oh, no, no, no.
Sure I'm on the side of the angels, against the powers of darkness.
What would you say,
Father, if I told you
I captured the king of the little people?
I'd say you had imagined it.
Ha-ha. Then I've nothin' at all in the bag here, Reverend.
Nothin' at all.
(laughing)
(cheering)
Glory be to the saints of joy.
This is a great day for Rathcullen.
You've certainly earned a glass of stout, Darby.
Aye, it's dry work cartin' a bell.
May we all live to see...
- Would a toast be a kind of wish?
- It would.
Oh, well, then, devil a toast will I drink this day.
What's in there?
The renowned Brian Connors, king of all the leprechauns.
One wish I wished already, but I'm not lettin' him out of this bag until I've wished the other two.
What does he look like, Darby?
Ah, just a teeny-weeny tawny little atom-y kind of gentleman with a beard on his face and a crown like a fistful of horns on his head.
Let's have a look at him, Darby.
Let's have a look at the little gentleman.
Oh, never mind, then.
Sure it's only
Lady Fitzpatrick's prize hen, the one they gave the red ribbon to at the fair.
(imitating chickens clucking)
Fill the little pannikin, 20 year old, the best in the house.
I will, Darby.
Thank you.
Here you are, Your Majesty.
(gulping noise)
(King Brian) Ah.
- Did you see that?
- I saw it with me own two eyes.
Give me the glass, Tom.
That's a story will bear repeatin'.
And if any man doubts the truth of it, there's the very same glass.
# Bum-ba-dum-ba-da-da-dee-dee
# Da-dum-ba-da-da-da-dun
# When the dew is on the hayrick
# And every drop a pearl
# When the geese are full of blarney
# And the thrush is singing Gaelic
# And standing in the doorway
# Is a pretty Irish girl
# Oh, she is my dear my darling one
# Her eyes so sparkling full of fun
# No other, no other can match the likes of her
# She is my dear my darling one
# My smilin' and beguilin' one
# I love the ground she walks upon...
- Now, where did you hear that?
- Michael was singin' it.
# My pretty Irish girl #
- Where are you off to?
- To a dance.
With Michael?
No. Michael's goin' your rounds for you.
He is?
Why'd he do that?
Well, he said you were worried about the poachers.
If I hurry, I'll catch up with him.
- Ah, the devil take you!
- Darby!
What ails you, lad?
Is it blind you are?
I am indeed. Sure when I saw man running in the dark with a game bag in his hand, wasn't I the foolish one to mistake him for a poacher?
By the hokey, it did look bad.
Will you forgive me?
Faith, a stepmother wouldn't blame ye.
No harm done.
I'm sorry, but I promised his lordship there'd be no poaching, and I can't make an exception, not even for you,
- so you'll have to let the rabbit go.
- Rabbit indeed.
(laughing)
I didn't intend to show him yet, but you've been a nice fella.
I'll give you the first look.
Bring him over here. Come on.
Get ready for the grand surprise.
It's no rabbit.
- Rabbit or hare, what's the odds?
- Rabbit or hare?
You're lookin' at Brian of Knocknasheega,
- king of all the leprechauns.
- 'Twas a rabbit I saw.
Have another look.
It's still a rabbit.
- Try closin' one eye.
- Closing one eye?
Ah, you've had a hard day today, and a hard night last night.
Now, why don't you go home to bed and get a good rest?
How could I rest, and you thinkin' I'm a poacher?
They take different shapes, you know?
So I hear.
Aye, you ought to see him with his little gold crown and his red beard and his two eyes leapin' from his head like flames.
- I wish you could see him.
- Granted.
And that's your second wish.
Why, you tricky, deceivin', connivin', double-dealin',
- high-handed...
- Oh, wirra, wirra, wirra.
That's what comes of a man not yet threescore and 10 matchin' his wits against an intellectual gladiator 5,000 years old.
Well, I still have me third wish left, and maybe me second one's not all wasted.
Now, go on.
Make yourself visible to him.
But I am visible to him.
You wished he should see me, and see me he does.
- He sees me as a rabbit.
- You're a cheat and you're a liar.
- Don't tell me you can't hear him.
- I'm afraid I can't.
What's the world comin' to?
I could have knocked a crock of gold out of this old chancer with that second wish, but I gave it all up for a man who can neither hear nor see.
Darby, he can see me as I really am... in his dreams tonight.
You can see him tonight in your dreams.
Are you sure?
I am.
He promised me.
Ah, the last reel was the best one.
You know, Katie, you're so light on your feet, you could tread on cobwebs without breaking them.
- Thank you, Sean.
- May I take you home now?
No need to trouble yourself.
Katie can ride home with me.
- I think it...
- Can't she?
That'll be grand, Pony.
- Good night, Sean.
- Good night, Katie.
(clicks tongue)
Come on. Hup! Hup!
Thank you for the ride.
Good night, Pony.
Have you no pride, ridin' home with the like of that?
He was only bein' civil to me, and I was no more than civil to him.
Well, you'd better forget about him altogether.
Well, maybe I will... when me father stops spyin' on me at windows.
Oh, tare and ages!
Isn't that a nice way for a girl to talk to her father?
And she me one and only.
She's a fine girl, Katie, but she's in mortal danger.
- How do you mean that?
- 'Tis you, the way you're dillydallyin' with your wishes.
Phadrig Oge, he's me lieutenant.
He'll stop at nothin' till he gets me back.
He might even put the come-hither on Katie, so's you'd have to wish her free again.
If he lays a finger on Katie,
I'll kill you dead and murder you entirely.
- Tell your Phadrig Oge that!
- Tell him?
How can I give the order, and me tied up in a sack?
I'll throw you in the river and drown you like a kitten.
Do that, and you'll have a scourge that'll make the potato famine
- look like a Sunday regatta.
- Don't you threaten me.
Your cows will die of the black leg and your sheep of the red water, and in every cradle in town there'll be a changeling!
I'm not afraid of you.
You'd better be.
I'm the one that keeps my kingdom in order, and all the unpleasant spirits of the night will run wild unless you wish your wish and let me go.
To tell you the truth,
I don't know what to wish for.
Then, uh, wish for the gold.
I'll give it to you this time.
Ah, she doesn't want the gold nor the manor house, neither.
- Who doesn't?
- Katie, I'm thinkin' of.
Well, uh, what does she want?
I don't know.
We were happy here, the two of us, but when I catch her dancin' and whirligiggin' with a drunken blatherumskite like Pony Sugrue... well, I don't know her at all.
Ah, she needs to settle her mind on a good steady lad with temperate ways.
That she does.
What if she found such a lad and fell in love with him, and he with her?
Would you wish your wish then?
I would.
Good.
Now, go to bed, have a good sleep.
Leave all to me.
Put your mind at rest.
Michael.
Michael.
What do you want?
I said I'd visit your dreams, and when I make a promise,
I keep it.
Well, I've seen you.
Now go away.
Ah, but I...
- I'd like to talk about Katie.
- How does she concern you?
She's the one that's keepin' me here.
Darby won't wish any more wishes until his girl is pleased.
Well, what can I do about it?
Marry her, and you can all live here as happy as three peas in a pod.
I hardly know the girl.
One look at her and you'll know her.
She's a nice girl and I like her, but...
Good.
Then next Sunday after Mass, take her up to the ruins on the top of Knocknasheega.
'Tis a fine romantic view from there.
Just lookin' down will make any girl so dizzy, she'll fall into your arms.
I don't want her to fall into my arms.
But then, of course,
I can't very well blame you.
Might mean gettin' your head broken.
I know if I was courtin'
Pony Sugrue's girl,
I'd be afraid, too.
Is it puttin' the coward's name on me you are?
Ah, no, no, no.
No, no. Go to sleep now.
Go to sleep.
Good lad.
Go to sleep.
Katie.
Katie.
I say, Katie.
He's a fine strong lad with temperate ways.
Hmm?
Michael is a fine strong lad with temperate ways.
He'd make you a grand husband.
I don't want a husband.
Not yet.
Not yet? Oh, Katie, many a girl has spoke these words and lived to rue them.
You know, when a girl is 20, her boy will marry her up in a minute, but when she's 30, doesn't she have a time trying to make him say the hard word?
- I'll have me courtship first.
- Courtship, is it?
And marriage the bone and sinew of the country?
What would you call a girl who'd keep her lad dangling through pure selfishness or sinful dalliance?
I know what I'd call her.
I'd call her...
I'd...
Katie.
Katie.
(whispers) Yes?
I returned as a matter of courtesy to give you the last word.
Me last word... is no.
That's grand.
That's grand.
Keep on sayin' that.
Keep on sayin' that.
(whispers) Keep on sayin' that.
"The ruins of old Ireland, how wondrously they stand
"by the lakes and rushing rivers on the hilltops of our land."
"Around these walls of battle, the Viking and the Dane, the Norman and the Saxon and the Cavaliers of Spain."
Ah, it makes a man feel like the lord of the castle.
I wonder now, is it the Danes or the Vikings swarming up the valley to storm the fort?
- The Danes.
- We'll both be put to the sword.
But before we are, you would crave the favor of one last kiss.
Mr. MacBride, I thought you could do better than that.
Maybe I could.
(laughing)
(gasps)
You don't care who you walk out with, do you?
Get off this land, or I'll report you to his lordship.
You do that.
(laughs)
Get out of the way.
Look who's talking.
If you lay a finger on him,
I'll never speak to you again!
Katie... when I need your help against the likes of that, I'll ask for it.
Pony Sugrue would have killed you.
- Would you care?
- Not in the slightest.
You have no interest in me at all?
You're certain sure?
Kiss her.
Kiss her.
Go on, kiss her.
Aah!
And him a Dublin man!
Look, look, look.
Will you wish your wish now?
- I will indeed.
- Good.
(bell chiming)
The bell.
Listen to the music of it.
Father Murphy gave it to me.
But the wish, Darby.
Ah, it would charm the fishes from the deep and the little birds down from the trees.
You said you'd wish your wish.
What? On Sunday, with my music floatin' over the countryside and Father Murphy himself pullin' the rope?
Tomorrow is Monday.
Will you wish your wish then?
I will.
Hush now.
Listen to my music.
Whoa, there.
Hello, Joe.
Morning, Mrs. O'Toole.
There's the post.
Did the tea come down from Dublin?
The pails, too.
Where's everybody going?
To the pub.
Darby is making his third wish.
His third wish?
The old fool.
Old fool indeed.
It's makin' too free with them, Darby is.
When you sup with the devil, you need a long spoon.
From America.
Nora Cassidy's son.
- Ah, there'll be money in that.
- The pails, Mrs. O'Toole.
- Right you are, Pony.
- "Michael MacBride, Rathcullen."
That's from the Lord Fitzpatrick.
I'd know his fist anywhere.
Look at the elegant swirls and all.
So that's why his lordship left him behind.
And now 'tis "Michael" this and "Michael" that.
The Dublin jackeen.
"And, Michael, go and open up the manor house
- and get Katie in to help."
- The dirty usurper!
- Poor old Darby.
- Poor Katie.
I wonder, does she know?
Maybe you should drop it by and leave her see it for herself.
Oh.
You think I should, now?
No Christian bein' would do any less.
Then I will so.
Look, Pony, his lordship wrote it to young Michael MacBride, and nary a word to Darby, now I ask you.
Ha! And you said you had an understanding with his lordship about me, and all this time,
MacBride has the job.
He won't keep the job if I have a son who's man enough to run him out of town.
Well, Pony?
What are you doing?
I'm packing, and if you don't know why, you can read the card.
Why didn't you tell me?
Your father made me promise that I wouldn't.
- When are you throwin' us out?
- Oh, now, Katie.
- When?
- Well, today was supposed to have...
- You give short notice.
- I don't want you to leave at all.
Why not?
What does it matter to you if you break an old man's heart?
You're a strong young man.
You can find work anywhere, but, no, you must come here and take me father's place.
No wonder he's chasin' the fairy gold, and him half out of his mind, tryin' to keep some little bit of self-respect in the town.
Here, you can clean the manor house yourself.
It'll be all we can do to move our belongin's out of your house this night.
Now, you listen to me.
I don't want your father's job at all, not unless I can have the both of you along with it.
I want you to stay here and be my wife.
I love you, Katie, and I think that you love me.
I?
Love you?
- Everybody ready?
- Yes, we're all ready, Darby.
Run and get a turf creel, a big one.
- What for?
- For to hold the gold.
- I'll not wish for the gold.
- Why not?
Nine times out of ten, it leads to unhappiness.
Wish for happiness, then.
Human beings need bitter with the sweet.
When I was a young lad, knee high with a sod of turf, me grandfather Podge...
God be good to him...
...he told me there was only one man in the town who was happy altogether... the village idiot.
- (laughter)
- (King Brian) Ha!
Were you addressing me,
Your Majesty?
What's all the speechmaking about?
Are you standin' for Parliament or what?
- Will I get you a drink, sir?
- You could make a wish.
- Get on with it.
- I'll do that.
You know what I'd wish for, Darby?
I'd wish for a grand, big house on top of a hill, as big as the castle at Cong.
- How would you look after it?
- I'd have the servants, too.
You didn't wish for the servants,
You didn't wish for the money to run the house.
There you'd be with a big house in your hands, as big as a church, and you the poorest church mouse in it.
Did you hear that?
Oh, he's got a head on his shoulders like Aristotle.
- Think of the best...
- Father!
Then ask yourself,
"What else might I lose if I had it?"
Father, you've got to come and catch the horse.
Not now, Katie.
His lordship is comin'.
We've got to move today!
Move out of the way, Katie.
I'm makin' me third wish.
Not here, Father!
Wait, Your Highness!
Wait, Your Highness.
Wait!
(mocking) Wait, Your Highness.
Wait!
(man) Catch him, Darby!
Catch the coinin!
(all shouting)
Darby, catch the coinin!
Make him give you the crocks of gold!
The crocks of gold!
- Get out of my way.
- Leave that horse alone.
Do you think I'd stay under your roof another night?
- I'll go to the inn.
- You can go to blazes.
I'm movin' to the McCarthy house.
With night coming down on that mountainside, you could get yourself killed.
Now, give me that halter.
I'll get the horse.
Ah, well, you look grand.
Now, don't move a finger until his lordship comes.
Katie!
Katie!
Katie!
Katie!
Katie!
Katie!
(sniffs)
Is it drunk you are?
- Who did it, lad?
- I don't know, but I can guess.
- Where's Katie?
- She's gone after the horse.
Did you let her go alone in the dark of the night?
She was in a tearin' rage at me, and sure it was your fault for not telling her the truth in the first place.
God forgive me.
She'll be chasin' a puca.
Oh, for goodness sakes.
(female voice wailing)
- The banshee!
- Maybe it's just the wind.
It's the wail of the banshee, the same as I heard the night that Katie's mother was taken.
She'll be destroyed entirely!
(thunder rumbling)
Katie!
Katie!
Katie!
(echo) Katie!
Katie!
(echo) Katie!
Katie!
Katie!
Katie.
Katie!
Katie!
Katie!
The banshee!
(wailing)
Keep away!
Keep away!
Keep away from her!
Keep off!
(wailing loudly)
Keep off, now!
Keep off, now!
Oh, me poor darlin'.
Your daddy didn't mean to do you any harm.
- Speak to me. Speak to me.
- Darby.
What have I done to you?
We'd better get her home.
(banshee wailing)
Brian!
King Brian!
King Brian!
King Brian!
What is it, man?
- Your Highness!
- What is it?
It's the coiste-bodhar, the death coach.
Send it away!
It's comin' for Katie.
Send it away.
But it's not within my powers, man.
Once it sets out, it can never return empty.
Then give me me third wish and let it take me instead.
You don't know what you're askin' for.
You promised!
Don't break your word.
Darby O'Gill, never in me born days...
Give me me third wish.
More's the pity.
Granted.
Darby O'Gill.
Get in.
(King Brian) Darby.
Darby.
I was on me way back home, and I says to meself,
"Brian," says I,
"'tis at his side you should be."
Well, then, the truth of it is,
I'm real glad to see you.
Ah, Darby, me boy,
- we've had great sport together.
- Aye, we did.
You've been a grand adversary.
'Tis sorry I am to see you come to this.
I can endure anything if Katie was all right.
Ah, you needn't fret about Katie.
Her fever broke the minute you set foot in this coach.
I'll be forever grateful to you.
In the years to come, maybe you'd keep an eye on Katie and Michael.
I'll do that.
'Tis a pity you won't be there to see them married.
Ah, it's better for the old to die than the young.
In the end, we all have to go.
That you do.
I wish I could go with you all the way.
I wish you could, too.
(laughing)
And you a knowledgeable man!
Darby, you've wished your fourth wish.
Goodbye, Darby, me friend.
(King Brian laughs)
It's a miracle. She's fine and sonsy, like a baby woken from sleep.
Michael, what a temper I have.
Well...
I like a lively girl.
I suppose I'm the only man alive today
to have rode in the coiste-bodhar and come back to tell it.
Coiste-bodhar.
'Twas his lordship's carriage you saw.
His coachman told me they found you rootin' in the mud of the road, so far gone in grief you were out of your mind entirely.
(laughs)
Pony, I heard you were goin' to live in Cahersiveen.
I am.
Then why don't you be on your way and leave us alone?
Don't worry.
I will.
I've heard enough silly blather about little people to last me a lifetime.
What kind of man are you at all that doesn't believe in the little people?
- Maybe you'd like to find out.
- Indeed I would.
You know, somebody beat me over the head that night, and I thought it was the little people, but when I spoke to King Brian about it, he said that you should take the consequences.
What consequences?
Indeed, that's what I asked his majesty, and you know what he said?
He said, "If I were you,
I'd clout the blackguard in the face."
- Ooh.
- (glass breaks)
Oh!
- (glass breaks)
- Ooh! Oh, gosh.
Ooh!
(whispers) Come on.
(whimpers)
Pony, me darlin'.
Oh, you poor thing.
Hold your whisht.
I'll have no more from you.
- Well, that didn't take long.
- Now I can get back to work.
I even feel like workin' meself.
I do indeed. Aye.
How do you feel about bringin' in the rest of the turf?
Well, lad, you took the words right out of me mouth.
Come around, Cleopatra.
Come on, now.
# Oh, she is my dear my darlin' one
# Her eyes so sparklin' full of fun
# No other, no other can match the likes of her
# Oh, he is my dear my darling one
# His eyes so sparkling full of fun
# No other, no other
# Can match the likes of him
(both) # She is my dear, my darlin' one
# My smilin' and beguilin' one
# I love the ground she walks upon
# My darlin' Irish...

I know you
I waked with you
once upon a dream
I know you
The gleam in your eyes
is so familiar a gleam
Yet I know it's true
That visions
are seldom all they seem
But if I know you
I know what you'll do
You'll Love me at once
The way you did
once upon a dream
"In a far away land
long ago lived a King...
"and his fair Queen.
"Many years had they longed
for a child...
"and finally
their wish was granted.
"A daughter was born,
and they called her Aurora."
Sweet Aurora
"Yes, they named her
after the dawn...
"for she filled their lives
with sunshine.
"Then a great holiday
was proclaimed...
"throughout the kingdom...
"so that all of high
or low estate...
"might pay homage
to the infant Princess.
"And our story begins
on that most joyful day."
On that joyful day
On that joyful day
Joyfully now
to our Princess we come
Bringing gifts
and all good wishes
To replete
our loyalty anew
Hail to the Princess Aurora
All of her subjects
adore her
Hail to the King
Hail to the Queen
Hail to the Princess Aurora
Health to the Princess,
wealth to the Princess
Long live
the Princess Aurora
Hail Aurora
Hail Aurora
Health to the Princess,
wealth to the Princess
Long Live
the Princess Aurora
Hail to the King
Hail to the Queen
Hail to the Princess Aurora
"Thus,
on this great and joyous day...
"did all the kingdom celebrate
the Awaited-awaited royal birth...
"and good King Stefan
and his Queen made welcome...
"their Lifelong friend."
Their Royal Highnesses...
King Hubert
and Prince Philip!
"Fondly had these
monarchs dreamed one day...
"their kingdoms to unite...
"thus, today would they
announce...
"that Philip,
Hubert's son and heir...
"to Stefan's child
would be betrothed."
"And so, to her
his gift he brought...
"and Looked, unknowing,
on his future bride."
Their most honored
and exalted Excellencies...
the three good fairies...
Mistress Flora...
Mistress Fauna...
and Mistress Merryweather!
- Ahh.
- Oh.
The little darling.
Your Majesties.
Each of us the child may bless... with a single gift... no more, no less.
Little Princess, my gift shall be... the gift of beauty.
One gift
Beauty rare
Gold of sunshine
in her hair
Lips that shame
the red, red rose
She'll walk with springtime
wherever she goes
Tiny Princess... my gift shall be the gift of song.
One gift
The gift of song
Melody her whole life Long
The nightingales
her tune adore
Bringing his sweet
serenade to her door
Sweet Princess, my gift shall be the...
Wind howls]
Why, it's Maleficent.
What does she want here?
Shhh.
Well...
Quite a glittering assemblage, King Stefan.
Royalty, nobility, the gentry, and... ah ha ha ha ha... how quaint.
Even the rabble.
Ooooh.
I really felt quite distressed... at not receiving an invitation.
You weren't wanted.
Not wa... ah ha.
Oh, dear, what an awkward situation.
I had hoped
it was merely due...
to some oversight.
Well, in that event,
I'd best be on my way.
And... you're not offended,
Your Excellency?
Why, no, Your Majesty... and to show I bear no ill will...
I, too, shall bestow a gift on the child.
Listen well, all of you.
The Princess shall indeed grow in grace and beauty... beloved by all who know her.
But... before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday... she shall prick her finger...
on the spindle
of a spinning wheel...
and die!
Oh, no!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
Seize that creature!
Stand back, you fools!
Don't despair,
Your Majesties.
Merryweather still has her gift to give.
Then she can undo this fearful curse?
Oh, no, sire.
Maleficent's powers are far too great.
But she can help.
But...
Just do
your best, dear.
Yes, go on.
Sweet Princess...
If through this
wicked witch's trick...
a spindle should
your finger prick...
a ray of hope
there still may be in this...
the gift I give to thee.
Not in death,
but just in sleep...
this fateful prophecy
you'll keep...
and from this slumber
you shall wake...
when true love's kiss
the spell shall break.
For true Love
conquers all
"But King Stefan...
"still fearful
of his daughter's Life...
"did then and there decree...
"that every spinning wheel
in the kingdom...
"should on that very day
be burned.
"So 'rwas done."
Oh, silly...
Now, come have a nice cup of tea, dear.
I'm sure it will work out somehow.
Well, a bonfire won't stop Maleficent.
Of course not, but what will?
Perhaps if we
reason with her...
Reason?
With Maleficent?
Well, she can't be all bad.
Oh, yes, she can.
Oooh. I'd like to turn her into a fat, old hop toad.
Now, dear, that isn't a very nice thing to say.
Besides, we can't.
You know our magic doesn't work that way. it can only do good, dear... to bring joy and happiness.
Well, that would make me happy.
But there must be some way.
But there must be some way.
There is!
There is?
What is it, Flora?
I'm going to...
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
[QUIETLY
Even walls have ears.
Follow me.
I'll turn her into a flower.
Maleficent?
No, no, dear, the Princess.
Oh, she'd make a lovely flower.
Don't you see?
A flower can't prick its finger. it hasn't any.
That's right.
She'll be perfectly safe.
Until Maleficent sends a frost.
Yes. Er...
Oh, dear.
She always ruins your nicest flowers.
You're right... and she'll be expecting us to do something like that.
Oooh.
Well, what won't she expect?
She knows everything.
Oh, but she doesn't, dear.
Maleficent doesn't know anything about love... or kindness or the joy of helping others.
You know, sometimes
I don't think...
she's really very happy.
That's it.
Of course.
It's the only thing she can't understand... and won't expect.
Oh!
Now, now, now... we have to plan it carefully.
Let's see,
the woodcutter's cottage.
Yes, yes, yes,
the abandoned one.
Of course, the King and Queen will object...
but when we explain
it's the only way...
Explain what?
About the three peasant women raising a foundling child... deep in the forest.
Oh?
Well, that's very nice of them.
Who are they?
Turn around.
- Why, it's us!
- Uh-huh.
You mean we us?
Uh-huh.
Take care of the baby?
Why not?
Oh, I'd like that!
Well, y-yes, but we'd have to feed it...
And wash it and dress it and rock it to sleep.
Oh, I'd love it.
You really think we can?
If humans can do it, so can we.
And we'd have our magic to help us.
That's right.
No, no, no, no, no, no!
No magic.
I'll take those wands right now.
Oh, better get rid of those wings, too.
You mean live like mortals?
For sixteen years?
Uh-huh.
But now... now we don't know how.
We've never done anything without magic.
And that's why Maleficent will never suspect.
But who'll wash and cook?
Oh, we'll all pitch in.
I'll take care of the baby.
Let me have it, dear.
Come along, now.
We must tell
Their Majesties at once.
Flora.
Flora.
 "So the King
and his Queen watched...
"with heavy hearts...
"as their most precious
possession, their only child...
"disappeared into the night."
"Many sad and lonely years
passed by...
"for King Stefan
and his people.
"But as the time
for the Princess's...
"sixteenth birthday
drew near...
"the entire kingdom
began to rejoice...
"for everyone knew...
"that as Long
as Maleficent's domain...
"the forbidden mountains...
"thundered with her wrath
and frustration...
"her evil prophecy
had not yet been fulfilled."
It's incredible!
Sixteen years, and not a trace of her!
She couldn't have vanished
into thin air!
Are you sure you searched everywhere?
Yeah, yeah, uh...
Everywhere... we all did.
Yeah! Yeah!
And what about the town?
The forest? The mountains?
Uh, we check mountains... uh... uh, forest...
Uh, houses and, uh, let me see, uh... and all the cradles.
Cradles?
Uh, yep, yep.
Ha ha ha ha.
Every cradle.
Cradle?!
Did you hear that, my pet?
All these years...
they've been looking
for a baby.
Oh, ha ha ha!
Fools!
Idiots!
Imbeciles!
- Aaah!
- Aaah!
Ooh! Ooh!
Ouch! Ouch!
Ahhh.
Oh, they're hopeless... a disgrace to the forces of evil.
Oh, my pet.
You are my last hope.
Circle far and wide.
Search for a maid of sixteen, with hair of sunshine gold... and lips red as the rose.
Go, and do not fail me.
"And so,
for sixteen Long years...
"the whereabouts
of the Princess...
"remained a mystery...
"while deep in the forest
in a woodcutter's cottage...
"the good fairies carried out
their well-laid plan.
"Living like mortals...
"they had reared the child
as their own...
"and called her Briar Rose."
"On this,
her sixteenth birthday...
"the good fairies
had planned a party...
"and something extra special
for a surprise."
Well, now, how about this one?
This is the one I picked.
Ooh, she'll look beautiful in that.
Now, I thought a few changes here.
Uh-huh.
Don't forget a pretty bow.
Yes, and raise the shoulder line.
We'll make it blue.
Oh, no, dear, pink.
Of course, we'll need a few pleats.
Yes, but how are
we going to get her...
out of the house?
I'll think
of something.
Well.
And what are you
three dears up to?
- Up to?
- Up to?
Up to? Er, er...
We... we want you to pick some berries.
That's it... berries.
- Berries?
- Lots of berries.
But I picked berries yesterday.
Oh, we need more, dear.
Lots, lots more.
Yes.
Now, don't hurry back, dear.
But don't go too far.
And don't speak to strangers.
Good-bye, dear.
Good-bye!
Good-bye!
I wonder if she suspected.
Of course not.
Come on.
Oh, will she be surprised.
A real birthday party... with a real birthday cake.
Yes, and a dress a Princess can be proud of.
I'll get the wands.
Yes, you g... the wands?
Oh, no!
No magic.
But the sixteen years are almost over.
We're taking no chances.
But I've never baked a fancy cake.
Oh, you won't have to, dear.
I'm going to bake the cake.
You?
Oh, she's always wanted to, dear... and this is her last chance.
Well...
I'm going to make it fifteen layers... with pink and blue forget-me-nots.
And I'm making the dress.
But you can't sew, and she's never cooked.
Oh, ho, ho, it's simple.
All you do is follow the book.
Up here, dear.
You can be the dummy.
Well, I still say we ought to use magic.
 La la
la da da da da
Dee dee dee deedle um
La da da
"Flour, 3 cups."
Cups, cups, cups, cups, cups, cups, cups.
Oh.
Dee da dee da da dum
What's that for?
Well, it's got to have a hole in the bottom.
That's for the feet
to go through.
It's pink.
Oh, lovely shade, isn't it?
But I wanted it blue.
Now, dear... we decided pink was her color.
You decided.
"Two eggs, fold in gently."
Fold?
Oh, well.
I can't breathe!
Get me out of here! it looks awful.
That's because it's on you, dear.
"Now yeast, 1 tsp."
Tsp?
One teaspoon.
One teaspoon! Of course!
Hmm.
Oh, gracious!
How that child has grown!
Oh, it seems only yesterday we brought her here.
Just a tiny baby.
Why, Merryweather!
Whatever is the matter, dear?
After today, she'll be a Princess... and we won't have any Briar Rose.
Oh, Flora!
Now, now, now, now.
W-we... we all knew this day had to come.
But why did it have to come so soon?
After all... we've had her for sixteen years.
Sixteen wonderful years.
Good gracious!
We're acting like a lot of ninnies!
Come on! She'll be back before we get started.
Do you hear that, Samson?
Beautiful!
What is it?
Come on. Let's find out.
Aw, come on.
For an extra bucket of oats?
And a few... carrots?
Hup, boy!
Whoa!
No carrots.
I wonder
I wonder
I wonder why
each little bird
Has a someone
To sing to
Sweet things to
A gay, little lark melody
I wonder
I wonder
If my heart
keeps singing
Will my song
go winging
To someone
Who'll find me
And bring back
a Love song to me
Oh, dear.
Why do they still treat me like a child?
Whoo!
Aunt Flora, Aunt Fauna...
Aunt Merryweather.
They never want me to meet anyone.
But you know something?
Whispering]
I fooled them.
I have met someone.
Whoo!
Whoo! Whoo!
Oh... a Prince.
Well, he's tall and handsome and... and so romantic!
Oh, we walk together and talk together... and just before we say good-bye... he takes me in his arms...
And then...
I wake up.
Yes,
it's only in my dreams.
But they say if you dream
a thing more than once... it's sure to come true.
And I've seen him so many times.
You know, Samson... there's something strange about that voice.
Too beautiful to be real.
Maybe it was
some mysterious being... a... a wood sprite or a...
Here! Stop!
Why,
it's my dream Prince!
Your Highness.
You know, I'm really not supposed... to speak to strangers... but we've met before.
I know you
I waked with you
once upon a dream
I know you
The gleam in your eyes
is so familiar a gleam
And I know it's true
That visions are seldom
all they seem
But if I know you
I know what you'll do
You'll Love me at once
The way you did once
upon a dream
But if I know you
I know what you'll do
You'll Love me at once
The way you did
once upon a dream
Oh!
Oh!
I'm awfully sorry.
I didn't mean to frighten you.
Oh, it... wasn't that.
It's just that you're a... a...
A stranger?
Mm-hmm.
But don't you remember?
We've met before.
We... we have?
Well, of course.
You said so yourself.
"Once upon a dream."
I know you
I walked with you
once upon a dream
I know you
The gleam in your eyes
Is so familiar a gleam
And I know it's true
That visions are
seldom all they seem
But if I know you
I know what you'll do
You'll Love me at once
The way you did once
Upon a dream
Who are you?
What's your name?
Hmm?
Oh. My name.
Why, it's... it's...
Oh, no, no! I can't! I...
Good-bye!
But when will I see you again?
Oh, never! Never!
Never!
Well... maybe someday.
When? Tomorrow?
Oh, no. This evening.
Where?
At the cottage, in the glen.
There.
Whoop!
Well, what do you think of it?
Why, it... it's a very unusual cake, isn't it?
Yes.
Of course, it will be much stiffer after it's baked.
Of course, dear.
Um... what do you think of the dress?
Well, it... it's...
It-it's not exactly...
the way it is in
the book, is it?
Oh, I improved it.
But perhaps if I added a few more ruffles... uh, what do you think?
Um... I think so.
What do you think,
Merryweather?
I think we've had enough of this nonsense!
I think we ought to think of Rose and what she'll think of this mess!
I still think what
I thunk before.
I'm going to get those wands!
You know... I think she's right.
Here they are!
Good as new!
Uh, uh, tut,
tut, tut, tut...
C-c-careful, Merryweather.
Quick!
Lock the doors.
Fauna,
you close the windows.
Oh, plug up every cranny.
We can't take any chances.
Now, you take care of the cake.
While I...
Clean the room, dear.
And I'll make the dress.
Now, hurry!
Ooh!
Come on, bucket, mop, broom.
Flora says,
"Clean up the room."
And now, to make a lovely dress fit to grace a fair Princess.
Eggs, flour, lemon
Just do it like it says here in the book.
I'll put on the candles.
Oh, no! Not pink!
Oh, no! Not pink!
Make it blue!
Merryweather!
Make it pink.
Whispering]
Make it blue.
Oh! Pink!
Blue!
Oh, now look
what you've done!
Shh! Shh! Listen!
It's Rose!
She's back!
Enough of this foolishness!
Make it pink.
Now hide! Quick!
Whispering]
Blue!
Aunt Flora!
Good gracious!
Who left the mop running?
Stop, mop!
Aunt Flora!
Fauna! Merryweather!
Where is everybody?
Oh!
Surprise! Surprise!
Happy Birthday!
Oh, you darlings!
This is the happiest day of my life!
Everything's so wonderful!
Just wait till you meet him!
Him?
Rose!
You've met some stranger?
Oh, he's not a stranger.
We've met before.
You have?
Where?
Once upon a dream.
I know you
I walked with you
once upon a dream
She's in love!
- Oh, no!
- This is terrible!
Why?
After all, I am sixteen. it isn't that, dear.
You're already betrothed.
Betrothed?
Since the day you were born.
To Prince Phillip, dear.
But that's impossible.
How could I marry a Prince?
I'd have to be...
A Princess.
And you are, dear.
Princess Aurora.
Tonight, we're taking you back
to your father, King Stefan.
But... but I can't!
He's coming here tonight.
I promised to meet him.
I'm sorry, child.
But you must never see that young man again.
Oh, no! No!
I can't believe it!
No! No!
And we thought she'd be so happy.
No sign of her yet, Hubert.
Of course not.
It's a good half-hour till sunset.
Ah, excellent bird.
Mmm!
Aw, now, come, man!
Buck up!
Battle's over.
Girl is
as good as here.
I'm sorry, Hubert... but after sixteen years of worrying... never knowing...
The past! All in the past!
Tonight,
we toast the future... with something I've been saving for sixteen years.
Here!
To the future!
Right, Hubert.
To the future!
Skumps! Skumps!
Skumps!
A toast to this night
The outlook is rosy
The future is bright
Our children
will marry
Our kingdoms unite
Skumps, skumps,
skumps
Ah!
Excellent vintage!
And now, to the new home, eh?
New home?
Children need a nest of their own, what?
A place to raise their
little brood, eh?
Well,
I suppose, in time.
Of course! To the home!
- Skumps!
- Skumps!
A toast to the home
One grander, by far
Than a palace in Rome
Uh, let me fill up your glass.
Ha! Ha! That last was all foam.
Skumps, skumps, skumps
The plans!
Weir,
what do you think?
Nothing elaborate, of course.
Forty bedrooms, dining hall.
Honeymoon cottage, really.
You... you mean... you're building it already?
Built, man! Finished!
Lovebirds can move in tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
But, Hubert, they're not even married yet!
I'll take care of that tonight.
To the wedding!
Now, hold on, Hubert.
I haven't even seen
my daughter yet...
and you're taking her
away from me.
Getting
my Philip, aren't you?
Yes, but...
Want to see our
grandchildren, don't we?
Of course, but...
Well, there's no time to lose.
Getting on in years.
Ha! Ha! Ha!
To the wedding!
Now,
be reasonable, Hubert.
After all, Aurora knows
nothing about all this.
- Well?
- Well, it... it... may come as quite a shock.
Shock?!
My Phillip a shock?!
What's wrong with my Phillip?
Nothing, Hubert.
I only meant...
Why doesn't your daughter like my son?
Now, now...
I'm not so sure my son likes your daughter!
Now, see here...
I'm not so sure my grandchildren... want you for a grandfather!
Why, you... you unreasonable... pompous, blustering, old windbag!
Unreasonable? Pompous?
En garde, sir!
I warn you, Hubert!
This means war!
Forward!
For honor! For country! For...
What's this all about, anyway?
Nothing, Hubert.
Absolutely nothing.
The children are bound to fall in love with each other.
Precisely.
And as for grandchildren...
I'll have the royal woodcarvers... start work on the cradle tomorrow!
Splendid!
King size, of course?
Certainly.
To the Woodcarver's Guild!
His Royal Highness...
Prince Philip!
Phillip!
Oh, Phillip!
Phillip!
Phillip! Hold, Phillip!
H-hurry, boy!
Hurry! Change into something suitable!
Can't meet your future bride looking like that.
But I have met her, Father.
You have? Where?
Once upon a dream.
Phillip!
Stop! Stop that!
Phillip! P-put me down!
Now... what's all this dream nonsense? it wasn't a dream, Father.
I really did meet her.
The Princess Aurora?
Good heavens!
We must tell Stefan!
Why, this is the most...
I didn't say it was Aurora.
You most certainly did!
You... you said that...
I said I met the girl
I was going to marry.
I don't know who she was.
A peasant girl,
I suppose...
A peasant g-girl?
You're... you're going to marry a...
Why, Phillip!
You're joking!
Uh... isn't he?
No! Y-you can't do this to me!
Give up the throne?
The kingdom?
For some... some nobody?
By Harry, I won't have it!
You're a Prince!
And you're going to marry a Princess!
Now, Father, you're living in the past.
This is the 14th century.
Nowadays...
Nowadays,
I'm still the King!
And I command you to come to your senses!
And marry the girl I love.
- Exactly!
- Good-bye, Father.
"Good-bye, Father.
Marry the girl you..."
No, no!
No, no, Phillip, stop!
Come back!
Oh, Philip!
Phillip!
Oh!
Oh, how... how will
I ever tell Stefan?
Whispering]
Come along, now.
All right, in here, dear.
Bolt the door,
Merryweather!
Fauna, pull the drapes!
And now, dear, if you'll just sit here.
This one last gift... dear child for thee... the symbol of thy royalty.
A crown to wear in grace and beauty, as is thy right and royal duty.
Now, dear.
Whispering]
Come.
Let her have a few moments alone.
It's that boy she met.
Whatever are we going to do?
Oh, I don't see why she has to marry any old Prince.
Now, that's not for us to decide, dear.
Maybe we should tell King Stefan about the boy.
Well, why don't we?
Listen!
Maleficent! Rose!
Rose! Rose! Aah!
Oh, why did
we leave her alone?
Rose! Rose!
Here.
Rose! Rose!
Rose, where are you?
Where are you?
Rose!
Rose!
Rose!
Rose!
Rose, don't touch anything!
Touch the spindle.
Touch it, I say!
You poor, simple fools.
Thinking you could defeat me.
Me, the mistress
of all evil!
Well, here's your precious Princess.
Rose!
Oh, Rose!
Oh, I'll never forgive myself.
We're all to blame!
Stefan, there's... there's something important
I have to tell you.
Not now, Hubert.
But it's about Phillip.
Phillip?
Oh, yes, of course, Phillip.
Why, where is the boy?
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
Well, send for him immediately!
- But...
- Shh!
The sun has set!
Make ready to welcome
your Princess!
Poor King Stefan and the Queen.
They'll be heartbroken when they find out.
They're not going to.
They aren't?
We'll put them all to sleep... until Rose awakens.
Come!
Sleeping beauty fair
Gold of sunshine
In your hair
Lips that shame
The red, red rose
Dreaming of true Love
In slumber repose
One day he will come
Riding out of the dawn
And you'll awaken
To Love's first kiss
Till then,
Sleeping Beauty
Sleep on
One day you'll awaken
To Love's first kiss
Till then,
Sleeping Beauty
Sleep on
Well, just been talking to Phillip.
Seems he's fallen in love with some...
Peasant girl.
Peasant girl?
Yes? Yes?
The peasant girl... who is she?
Where did he meet her?
Just some peasant girl he met.
Where?! Where?!
Once upon a dream.
Once upon a dr...
Rose! Prince Phillip!
Oh! Oh!
Come on.
We've got to get back to the cottage.
Whistling
Once Upon a Dream]
Come in!
Well... this is a pleasant surprise.
I set my trap for a peasant, and lo,
I catch a Prince!
Away with him.
But gently, my pets... gently.
I have plans for our royal guest.
Maleficent!
She's got Prince Phillip!
At the forbidden mountain.
But we can't!
We can't go there!
We can, and we must!
What a pity Prince Phillip... can't be here to enjoy the celebration.
Come.
We must go to the dungeon and cheer him up.
Oh, come now, Prince Phillip.
Why so melancholy?
A wondrous future lies before you.
You, the destined hero... of a charming fairy tale come true.
Behold...
King Stefan's castle...
And in yonder
topmost tower...
Dreaming of her true Love...
the Princess Aurora.
But see the gracious
whim of fate.
Why, 'tis the selfsame
peasant maid...
who won the heart
of our noble Prince...
but yesterday.
She is indeed
most wondrous fair.
Gold of sunshine
in her hair.
Lips that shame
the red, red rose.
In ageless sleep...
she finds repose.
The years roll by... but a hundred years to a steadfast heart... are but a day.
And now the gates
of a dungeon part...
and our Prince
is free to go his way.
Off he rides
on his noble steed...
a valiant figure...
straight and tall... to wake his love... with love's first kiss...
and prove that true Love
conquers all.
Why, you... you...
Come, my pet.
Let us leave our noble Prince... with these happy thoughts.
A most gratifying day.
For the first time in sixteen years...
I shall sleep well.
Shh! No time to explain.
Wait, Prince Phillip.
The road to true love may be barred... by still many more dangers...
which you alone
will have to face.
So arm thyself... with this enchanted shield of virtue...
and this mighty sword
of truth.
For these weapons
of righteousness...
will triumph over evil.
Now, come. We must hurry.
Whinnies]
Phillip, watch out!
Silence!
You, tell those fools to...
No! No!
Watch out, Phillip!
Hurry! Hurry, Phillip!
A forest of thorns shall be his tomb.
A forest of thorns shall be his tomb.
Born through the skies on a fog of doom.
Now go with the curse
and serve me well...
Round Stefan's castle...
Cast my spell!
Whinnies]
Whinnies]
No, it cannot be!
Now shall you deal with me, o Prince... and all the powers of hell!
Whinnies]
Up! Up this way!
Now, Sword of Truth, fly swift and sure... that evil die and good endure!
Oh, oh, uh, forgive me, Hubert.
The wine.
Now, uh, you were saying?
Huh? I was?
Oh, oh, yes.
Well, after all, Stefan... this is the 14th century.
Yes. You, uh... you said that a moment ago.
Well, to come right to the point... my son Phillip says he's going to marry...
It's Aurora. She's here!
And... and... and Phillip!
What does this mean, boy?
I... I don't...
But, but, but...
I don't understand.
Why, Fauna, what's the matter, dear?
Oh, I just love happy endings.
Yes. I do, too.
Blue?!
Pink!
I know you,
I walked with you once...
Blue!
... upon a dream
I know you
The gleam in your eyes
Is so familiar a gleam
And I know it's true
That visions
are seldom all they seem
But if I know you
I know what you'll do
You'll Love me at once
The way you did once
Upon
A
Dream

Salaam.
This tale begins in the year 1885... when Alexander lll was czar of Russia... and Victoria of England was also empress of lndia. lndia, gateway to the East... empire of magnificent pageantry and exotic color... the jewel of the Orient, land of mysticism and reality... whose history is filled with the romance... and the intrigue of the 19th century... which already belongs to a legendary past.
To the romantic domain of Rudyard Kipling... to the days when the white man was called ''sahib. ''
These were the days of turmoil and bloodshed... caste against caste, creed against creed.
At this time, all eyes would turn to the warlike hillmen... who continually swept down to battle.
To prevent massacres, there was banded together... a small group of men.
Some were native-born, others rich.
Heading this secret service was a certain Colonel Creighton.
He called their work the ''Great Game''... and the history books tell us that many died playing it. ln this year of unrest, in the city of Lahore... one starlit night... among the rooftop quarters of the women... who were well-guarded from all eyes, save those of their lords and masters... there roamed a small boy known as Kim.
A product of the gutters and bazaars... an orphan waif, who lived by his shrewdness and cunning.
Having known only poverty...
Kim was ever-willing to risk his neck for a copper coin... or for a good friend.
-Laluli?
-Yes? Who are you? l bear a message.
The Red Beard chooses well, flower of delight.
Since when does the Red Beard risk the life of a boy? Go home.
Oh, no. ln truth, l was sent by Mahbub Ali, the Red Beard.
What is the message?
He trades horses on the Kulu Road.
He'll come to see thee tomorrow evening.
Give him this key.
My lord and master journeys to another city.
Tell the Red Beard he may come in safety.
Caution him to wait until the moon has fallen.
Keep thy beauty in the shade,
O dispenser of delights.
The red-bearded goat comes tomorrow night.
You will make him very welcome when he comes.
He is but a horse trader.
Why not cut him down in some alley?
We begin to think this Red Beard is a different kind of horse trader.
Tell her for what she must search.
He may carry upon his person a certain parchment... which if decoded would show our enemies... the five points from which we plan to strike.
Should this reach the Creighton sahib... there will be soldiers maneuvering, and we will again have to wait.
The Czar's emissaries become impatient.
You see?
A sultry night, perfumed brandy... it should be easy. l understand.
But l like it not.
Defiler of the faith! Beggar's brat! lmp of the devil!
May you be reborn a gnat!
Kim found it more convenient to pose as an lndian... because the missionaries sent white boys to school.
But on occasions such as this, when it suited his purpose... he would don the dress and manners of his own race.
Who are you looking for?
A defiler of the women's quarters.
-Defiler of the rooftops.
-No less. l saw a fleeting shadow go that way.
But run not the wind from your belly. l hear many whispers from the bazaars.
His name l will reveal to you.
You are my friend.
Does a cheroot go with your gratitude?
Have you a taper?
Mahbub Ali.
Well, little sahib. What have you for me?
Tomorrow night. She bid you wait until the moon has fallen.
Well done, friend of all the world.
Well done.
Gratitude is good for the ear, but a rupee is better for the stomach.
One day, you'll make a great trader.
And ride horses and wear a cloak like that?
No, there's but one Mahbub Ali.
Besides, such a cloak costs many rupees. l'm no camel. l can earn rupees.
So you can.
Come to me tomorrow, the Kashmir Serai Gate.
One hour before the sun sets.
Boy, l'm falling! lt's mine! Come on!
Boy, give it back to me! l paid for it!
What's the matter with you? l got it!
Perhaps it is a man.
Without a doubt.
But he's no man of lndia l have ever seen.
He is a foreigner.
He is a wandering priest.
Look, he carries praying beads.
What is your caste?
Where is your house?
Have you come far?
From the hills of Tibet... where the air and the water are fresh and cool.
A holy man?
Priest of the Lord Buddha, living in peace.
But l came forth to find the River of the Arrow.
River? That's not difficult to find.
Then thou knowest the River of the Arrow?
What is the River of the Arrow?
The Lord Buddha shot an arrow.
Where it touched the earth, there broke out a stream... whose virtue is that whoever bathes in it washes away all taint of sin. ls that all?
My dream told me to find it.
-For years l have searched.
-Years?
How do you fare on the road?
On charity.
What is the custom of charity in this town? ln silence or aloud?
Those who beg in silence starve in silence. l beg as the master begged.
Even as he went, so go l. lt is past midday. lf you would eat, you must hurry.
That l cannot do.
The rule demands that my chela beg for me.
-Chela?
-Disciple.
A helper. l see. Where is your chela?
Alas, he left me three days ago.
Since then, l have not eaten. lf you had a chela, would he share your charity?
How else would he live?
Give me your bowl. Rest, thou. l know the people of this city.
They're broken. lt is of no consequence, since my eyes have long outaged them. l beg for a holy man. l am tired of new priests and tired of old priests.
They settle on our wares like flies.
But he is a very holy man.
He has come a long way without food.
You will win great merit.
Just once, fill this little bowl.
Little bowl? That's a sheep-bellied basket.
My holy man can curse as well as bless.
My holy man is not a cow.
A little curry, perhaps.
A little conserve would please him, l think.
Your holy man must have a large belly.
Must his chela go hungry?
Then ask the holy man's blessing upon my daughter... who bears no children.
Thou art a wonderful provider.
Thou hast not seen all, yet.
Broken glasses.
What kind of magic is this?
Again l see clearly.
Even thy face... which is very young and very honest. l see now that thou was sent for a purpose.
Now you talk like a missionary.
With thee, l shall find the River of the Arrow.
But l search for a red bull on a green field.
Have you seen something like that in your travels?
Before my father died... he said l was to look for the coming of a red bull on a green field... and a sahib on a white horse leading 900 first-class devils.
That's my search. lt's all here, in the papers of my father. l cannot read, but it is here.
Then we shall search together.
Thee for thy red bull, and l for my river.
Now, what can a river do for you? lt is written that this river can free a man from the ties and fears of earth... from all the world's uneasy circumstance. lt can open the doors to final wisdom.
Will thou search with me and be my chela?
Not l, holy man.
But l'll find you a place to sleep.
Kim led the lama through the hustling throng... which always gathered near the Kashmir Serai Gate... where the caravans made their encampment... before entering the city of Lahore... to the huge, open square... where the camel and horse caravans paused... on their return north from Central Asia.
Here were all manner of traders.
Men from Kashmir, men from Afghanistan... camel drivers, grooms, elephant tenders....
All the races of Upper lndia.
Kim made straight for the quarters of the man he envied... and admired most in all lndia:
Mahbub Ali, the red-bearded horse trader.
Mahbub Ali?
A lama.
Here is a priest of the god Buddha.
See if he'd be hungry.
The Holy One will come to the fire. l will come to you later.
He needs taking care of. He is but a child.
What are you doing with this lama from Tibet?
He's friendless, quite mad. He wants me to travel with him to Benares.
And do you go?
No. l've decided to travel with you. lndeed.
Marsala.
What perfume!
The beard becomes silk.
Try it next time you grow one.
Umballa is on the way to Benares. lf you travel as far as Umballa with your holy man, l'll pay you well.
He who travels alone travels faster.
But not as safely. l wish you to travel as the holy man's chela.
What must l do? l have a message for you to deliver.
What's the message? l wish-- l know the ways of horses and seek service in your caravan.
Go to my head man. Ask him.
Leave it open.
Closed doors invite inquisitive eyes.
Put up your hands as though begging.
Be charitable, O protector of the poor. ln Umballa, you'll seek out
Creighton sahib.
My mother is dead! My father is dead!
You'll say to him, ''The pedigree of the white stallion is fully established.''
Give alms to the poor, O maharajah.
Then he'll know you come from me and he'll ask you for proof.
Win merit in the hereafter.
My stomach is empty.
You'll say, ''The Red Beard has given me the proof.''
-My mother is dead--
-Are you the only beggar in this city?
Your parents are dead! Your sister's dead!
Your dog's dead! So it is with all of you.
Here's bread.
Thank you, O protector of the poor.
To hear is to obey.
Chew it well. l shall be trading horses down the Grand Trunk Road.
Perhaps there will be more rupees for you, little friend of all the world.
The moon is falling.
This is the hour of beauty.
She's younger than some and prettier than many that you've sent me to.
The sky's the same color wherever you go.
To a small boy... the Red Beard had entrusted a big message... upon which many lives depended.
Although Kim could not understand the meaning... of the five holes in the parchment... it was for him the beginning of the Great Game.
Come in. He's drunk beyond hearing.
He's a red-bearded goat.
You will pay me well for this.
There's nothing. l searched the soles of his sandals and folds of his turban.
-They're as empty as his head.
-He could have sent it away by now. l think he's no more than a pleasure-hungry horse trader.
They did not say it was Mahbub Ali.
They said a horse trader.
The country's full of horse traders.
Take the goat with you.
No. Watch him well.
Hassan Bey is searching his belongings.
He may find that for which we look.
Wake, Holy One. lt is your chela.
My chela. Thou?
Thy mind changes. l go with you. lt was so ordained.
-Be quick.
-What, why now?
The train departs at daybreak. lt was so ordained.
This is the work of the devil.
No. lt is the work of the government.
Be not afraid.
When l was young, l, too, was afraid of the train.
Come.
While Kim was carrying the message to Colonel Creighton... that gentleman, as head of the British-lndian Secret Service... was receiving disturbing reports from his agents.
Reports that warned of bloodshed and plunder.
-Salaam, sahib.
-Chunder. l hardly recognized you in that beard. lt is easy to disguise the face, sahib, but with me, the real difficulty is here.
-There is much trouble coming, sahib.
-Yes.
All reports indicate attacks from the north.
Here is my report, sahib.
Lurgan. l'm delighted to see you, but what are you doing so far away from your post?
There are times when one is afraid to trust a third person... or even a cohort.
But for the belly, l'd never have recognized you.
There's real trouble, Colonel.
No roving bands of hillmen this time... but a well-organized, full-scale attack.
Yes.
Even Simla's crawling with their spies.
Looks like history is repeating itself.
Russian influence again advances like a tide throughout Central Asia.
Another Afghan war.
The Czar is once more sending arms and supplies across this border... as they did in 1878.
His agents and staff officers are in Afghanistan.
They are organizing the hillmen for a sweep through the Khyber Pass... down into the plains of lndia.
Well, the pattern's very clear.
The vital question is when and where they'll strike. l sent the Red Beard north to get that information. l should've heard from him. l'm afraid--
Well, don't worry about Mahbub Ali, Colonel.
He bears a charmed life.
You will resume your disguise as the cab driver at Lucknow railway station... and observe all Europeans coming from the north by train.
Yes, sahib. l wish you both a jolly good day.
Now, give me your report.
The General is dining with me tonight, and he'll want to see this.
Thank you.
Be sure the Commander sahib's curry is the way he likes it. Very hot.
Yes, sahib.
O protector of the poor.
The pedigree of the white stallion is fully established.
What proof have you?
The Red Beard has given me this proof.
Perhaps another coin for my holy man who awaits with an empty belly.
-Good evening, sir.
-Good evening.
-How are you, sir?
-Hungry, l could eat a horse. l have one cooking for you, sir. lt may be a little indigestible.
A white stallion from Lahore.
Come into the map room, sir.
-Peters, help yourself to a peg.
-Thank you, sir.
The white stallion message came through.
They'll strike from these five points.
With my lancers, the artillery and the mavericks... we'll have 8,000 men in the field if we force-march.
This means war.
My compliments to Colonel Stevenson.
He's to report here at once.
Yes, sir.
Colonel Stevenson.
Rest you. l go beget our evening meal. l beg for a very holy man, and he is also very hungry.
Today is not a fast day.
-A little meat, perhaps, and fried rice.
-Begone.
The world is too full of holy men who expect to eat the food of those who toil.
-ls he very ill?
-Nay.
-Perhaps the devil's entered into him.
-lt is only his father's temper.
Such a handsome baby, but l fear he's very ill. l've seen things like this before.
What evil hangs over us, my little frog?
Hush, my little owl.
My lama's a very great and holy man.
Only yesterday, a woman came to him with a great, burning pain here.
After the holy man blessed her, the evil came out... and ran away in the shape of a green mouse. l saw it with my own eyes.
-Where is your lama?
-At the gate.
Last week, he made a blind man see... and took in payment a handful of rice.
Thy blessing on this child, Holy One.
A blessing on this and all children.
Thou art indeed a wonderful provider.
The Grand Trunk Road... running straight across lndia for 1,500 miles.
Such a river of life as exists nowhere else in the world.
They walked in silence.
The lama, as usual, deep in meditation.
There were new sights at every stride.
The drum and flute of a marriage procession mingled... with the laughter of the dancing girls as they journeyed to a village wedding.
Of the five million holy men in lndia... none were more startling than the sadhus, with their weird antics.
Kim's eyes were bright and wide open... drinking in the sights of this endless highway.
Kim and his lama rubbed elbows with all humanity... from the lowly beggar to the maharajah... who traveled the Grand Trunk Road in lordly state... accepting homage from those who passed, and giving alms to those who pled.
Only when the lama saw a river or a stream did they pause.
Chela, look, another river! lndia's full of rivers.
Perhaps it is the one l seek.
Tell me, little mother, is this the River of the Arrow?
The River of the Arrow?
No, that is the Chambok River.
The sacred river would not be known as the River of the Arrow.
But l shall be given the power to know it when l see it.
What ails your holy man?
He's quite sane until he sees a river.
Then he's quite mad.
See, Holy One? lt's just another little stream.
No, Holy One, don't go there!
See, a cobra. King cobra.
No.
Let him live out his life.
He's bound up on the wheel of life as we are.
Great evil must this soul have done to be reborn in this shape.
No, Holy One, don't go.
Please!
May thy release come soon.
Never have l seen such a holy man.
Do even the snakes understand your talk?
Who knows?
Come.
No, l will go around.
Come. He will do thee no hurt.
Be not afraid. Come.
Oh, Holy One!
After the miracle of the cobra, there grew in the boy's heart... a real love for the old priest.
Kim and the lama journeyed on, and there were long, dusty days... on the Grand Trunk Road.
But Kim, inspired by his new faith... found joy in serving his holy man.
Willingly, he followed the lama in his search for the sacred river... proudly assuming the role of disciple... begging a place for them by some campfire at night... pleading, conniving, and cajoling for their food by day.
O protector of the poor, give food for a holy man.
Stand farther off, beggar!
Since when does a hillman own all Hindustan?
Begone, thou filth of the earth. Thou infected descendant of unspeakable slime!
Thy father rooted for offal in the alleys while thy mother begged in the streets.
Where l come from, they call that the beginning of love talk.
Fill the beggar's belly!
Look, Holy One.
What are they doing?
See, it is a green flag, and the bull is red.
A red bull in a green field!
This touches thy search.
See, Holy One? lt is as written.
Not only the red bull on the green field... but the 900 devils and the colonel on the big, white horse.
This is sorcery.
-Are you there, Ainsley?
-Come in, Father.
That is a sahib priest.
Go, talk to him of thy search.
Perhaps he might also have heard of my river.
Gotcha!
Stop that, you little heathen!
-What goes on here?
-l caught him sneaking around the tents.
Let's take a look at him.
Come on, up you get. ln you go.
Boys who steal are punished. l suppose you know that. l am no thief.
Give it to me! That is my charm!
Do not thieve it from me!
-Better take a look at it, Father.
-Give it back to me and let me go!
Powers of darkness.
The honorable discharge of Colonel Sergeant Kimball O'Hara... and the birth certificate of his son.
Why, Ainsley, l married them myself,
O'Hara and Annie Scott.
-Where did you get these, boy?
-They are mine.
Will you listen to this, now?
Scrolled in O'Hara's hand.
''Take care of the boy.
''Please take care of the boy. O'Hara.''
-Where did you steal these from?
-l do not steal. They are mine.
You see, Ainsley?
He's white, white as you and me.
-What's your name?
-Kim.
Or, Kimball, like your father.
-l say Kim. Now let me go.
-No one's going to hurt you.
Now, sit down and tell me all about yourself.
What happened to your father after he left the regiment?
He is dead in Lahore city, since l was very little.
-And your mother?
-She died when l was born.
What are you doing in those clothes?
They send white boys to school.
What brings you on the Grand Trunk Road?
At present, l am the disciple of a holy man.
-What?
-l follow in the footsteps of the Lord.
That's more than l was able to teach the father. l do not lie. l saw the red bull on the green field.
The red bull?
The camp markers with the regimental insignia. lt was my father's prophecy to the woman who took care of me when l was little.
That and the 900 devils, and the colonel riding the white horse.
The day of miracles is not done.
-He could be O'Hara's son, all right.
-He's an O'Hara, and that's no lie.
The dad was a good man, l'm telling you.
And a good soldier when he wasn't drinking.
There's a school for regimental orphans that'll make a good man of you, too. l wish only to stay with my holy man. lf you try to take me from him, he will give you very bad curses.
Who would take thee from me?
Holy One, tell them that l am thy chela.
Tell them l help thee seek a sacred river.
Then they won't send me to the school of the sahibs.
Why would they send a son of lndia to the school of the sahibs?
Because he is a sahib and the son of a sahib. lt is true. l've known it since my birth.
But no sahib knows the people and customs of the land...
-as thou knowest them.
-He carries with him proof. lf further proof were needed... there's his skin where the sun has not scorched it.
Thou hast done a wrong to an old man... because my heart went out to thee.
And mine to thee.
But how could l know the red bull would bring me to this?
What difference is it between us because l am a sahib? lf thou art a sahib...
-thou belongest amongst thy people.
-No, l belong to thee.
Do they give or sell learning among the sahibs?
That depends.
Regimental funds would take care of the boy at the military orphanage. l do not want to go to the sahib school.
And the more money paid, the better the learning given?
That is so.
What should l learn that thou does not teach?
The best schooling is at St. Xavier's at Lucknow.
But that's out of the question. lt costs 400 rupees a year.
No rajah has such sums.
Write the school name and the amount of money upon a paper... and it shall be received. l ask thee, as one priest to another. l am still thy chela.
Travel towards Benares.
-Later, l will find thee on the road.
-No.
Thou must stay with thine own people.
Have l failed thee that l'm taken from thee? l have known many men in my so long life... and chelas not a few... but to none among them has my heart gone out as it has to thee.
Never have l seen such a holy man as thou.
The days are few since we took the road together... yet it seems as though it were 100 years.
A blessing on thee. l want you to promise me now you'll not try to join him.
Cheer up.
We'll make a white boy of you as soon as we get you to Umballa.
Umballa?
You're not going to Umballa, you're going to war.
We're not going to war, Kim, we're on maneuvers.
We do this twice a year.
You're going to war.
That's the only reason l stay with you.
Otherwise, do you think 1,000 sentries would keep me from my holy man? l say it is war, a war of 8,000 men.
The lancers, the artillery, and us Red Bulls.
Major Ainsley, sir.
Will you report to the Colonel immediately, sir? We're breaking camp.
-What's going on, Shaughnessy?
-lt's war, Your Reverence.
Orders to entrain tonight for the Khyber Pass.
Powers of darkness!
How did you know, boy? l forgot to tell you.
Among other things, l am a prophet.
-A Company!
-F Company!
D Company! Attention!
Kim's hope of going to war with his father's regiment was soon doomed.
The timely movement of troops to the border had again averted war... and Kim found himself a prisoner in the orphanage school... in the barracks at Umballa. ln this problem, we have two known factors...
''A'' and ''B.''
''X,'' the unknown quantity, is arrived at by....
This is the last straw, O'Hara. l've tried to show you kindness and tolerance.
But when you go to sleep right in my face, something must be done about it.
You'll be confined to barracks.
What is your price for a short letter?
What manner of white man's son are you to need a bazaar letter writer? ls there not a schoolmaster in the barracks?
What manner of an inquisitive goat are you?
Thy mother was married under a basket.
Thy father was a sweeper of the stables.
Who are you... dressed in that fashion to speak in that fashion?
Write as l tell you.
Bad words have made the price higher.
First, my pay: four annas.
That is the price for sahibs.
Now fix me a true price.
Anna and a half.
There's the matter of the stamp, too. l pay no commission on that.
Now write.
To Mahbub Ali, the horse trader at Lahore.
Mahbub Ali! Wonder of wonders! l came with the holy man as far as Umballa.
There l delivered with great success the news of the white....
-The news of the bay mare's pedigree.
-Slower, a little.
But l was seized... by the soldiers of the Red Bull... who put me to school.
The clothes are heavy.
My heart is heavy, too.
Come and help me... or send me some money, for l have not sufficient... to pay the writer who writes this letter.
What? You haven't--
Devil take ye, O'Hara!
Ain't it hot enough around here... without having to forage around to find a scut like you? lf they don't skin you alive when we get back, l'll do it myself.
Now march, you lunk, or l'll twist it out of your socket.
The school is very terrible. l beg you to help me, Mahbub Ali, as l have helped you in the past.
-You helped me?
-You have a short memory. l carried a message all the way from Lahore to Umballa. l send many messages. l cannot well remember one from the other. l was to meet you on the Grand Trunk Road.
And l would earn rupees. Many rupees.
You belong with your people.
A true man, like a true horse, runs with his breed.
Let me go, you faithless Afghan.
Selling me back to the soldiers... what price will they give you for blood money?
Cheerful young devil. l will not pay you more than 150 rupees for the mare.
Then regretfully, Colonel sahib, l cannot sell her to you.
You have some strange friends, young man. l have but one, my holy man.
Please let me go to him.
All in good time, O'Hara.
You should know that, being a prophet.
A prophet?
You knew of the trouble up north before the marching orders were out.
The night has many eyes, Colonel...sir.
Even a cat cannot see through a wall.
Yet, 'tis said,
''Even the wall has long ears.''
Or ventilators, O'Hara?
Powers of darkness!
Will you look at this now?
A native banker's note for 1,200 rupees... and a signature good from here to China.
And read this. lt taxes my powers. How the devil...
Yes, he's the man l mean.
...can a wandering native beggar beg... this sum of money to educate a white boy?
You're going to St. Xavier's.
What do you think of that, young fellow?
The holy man said he would send the money. Naturally, he has sent it. l'd like to see the documents you found around his neck.
-lf you'll come inside, Colonel.
-Right.
Trust a frog before a rat, and a rat before a snake... and a snake before a Red Beard!
Children should not see a carpet on a loom before the pattern becomes clear.
Believe me, friend of all the world, l do you great service.
-They'll not make a soldier out of you.
-What good is all this to me?
You'll go away, and they will return me to the school rooms. l shall never see my holy man again.
Mahbub Ali, come in here for a moment, please.
Sahib?
As regards that wild young horse you captured....
Yes, sahib.
When a colt is born to be a polo pony... l think it would be a crime to bind him to a heavy cart.
Yes. l'll take him to be trained for polo only.
But first of all, he must be schooled.
-And very well-schooled.
-l'm sure that when the time comes... he'll be a credit to the Great Game.
This way, sahib.
Coachman!
This is a fair city, this Lucknow. lt is the center of all idleness, intrigue and luxury.
-Drive me a little through the bazaar.
-Nay.
My order is to drive you to St. Xavier's School.
Did you hear me, son of a snake?
Father of all thieves and robbers?
Drive me through the bazaar.
You infected descendant of unspeakable slime!
Unspeakable slime?
That is good. That is very good.
Welcome, brother.
The sky is the same color wherever you go. l drive many young sahibs to and from this school.
Devils all. But to speak the truth... l have never seen one that had in him the making of a better devil than you. ls that the school?
Nice little building.
Stop! l have waited here a day and a half.
Not that l was led by any affection for thee... but because l acquire merit by helping thee to wisdom.
Surely, it was a little to see me that you came. lt is a sin to be misled by affection.
That is not part of the way.
Thou art young and will soon forget me and our meetings.
But l shall be eating your bread.
How can l forget you? l am all alone in this land.
Do not go altogether away. lt is manifest that l shall acquire additional merit by... writing thee letters and coming to see thee from time to time.
Much rather would l leave all this... and go with you.
Do not grieve, my chela.
All desire is illusion, and a tie to bind thee upon the wheel of life.
Come.
Does thou love me?
Then go... or my heart cracks.
Mr. O'Hara, sir. l'm Dr. Bronson.
We were expecting you.
These gentlemen are members of the teaching staff.
Gentlemen!
This is Kimball O'Hara. l'm sure you'll make him welcome in our midst.
Thorpe, we'll place O'Hara temporarily in your form.
How do you do? This way.
Bearer.
-Just come out from England?
-What school are you from?
-Any good at cricket?
-What's the family? Civil service or army?
-Army.
-So am l. Put it there, O'Hara!
-Connor's the name.
-Wish they'd stuck you in another form.
You make 13, and l'm superstitious.
Leave him alone and let him eat.
Go ahead, O'Hara.
We don't do that at St. Xavier's, O'Hara.
We don't do that at St. Xavier's.
We don't do that at St. Xavier's, O'Hara.
We don't do that at St. Xavier's, O'Hara.
We don't do that at St. Xavier's, O'Hara.
We don't do that at St. Xavier's, O'Hara.
We don't do that at St. Xavier's, O'Hara.
We don't run away like a thief in the night. lf we have a problem that makes us unhappy or discontented... we face it.
We talk it over with each other... and try to get our feet back on the ground.
Yes, sahib, sir. l know your background, O'Hara.
And l know how it must feel to be in a cage.
But many of the boys here are lndian-born, like yourself.
We're teaching them to command.
But no man is fit to command... until he's first learned to command himself.
Yes, sir.
Colonel Creighton has high hopes for you.
But l'm so far behind on the road to learning.
What about that interesting chap who made it possible for you to be here? l mean the lama.
You wouldn't want to let him down, would you?
Rather would l be reborn a snake.
That's all l wanted to know.
Go back to your dormitory.
There'll be no report made of this incident.
Thank you, sir.
As for that road to learning... l shall be here every evening from dinner until roll call.
Perhaps l can help you catch up.
Thank you, sir.
With the coming of the sultry heat of summer, the students of St. Xavier's... left for their long vacation.
But Kim, who had no family... must return to spend his holidays in the military orphanage at Umballa.
Stop here.
We haven't time. l've given my word to see you safely to Umballa.
-l want to get something in Sarges.
-Look sharp. There isn't much time. lt won't take long.
No stain holds longer than walnut juice.
-But remember, it does not wash off.
-l shall remember.
You are very young a sahib to go for such devilry.
Thank you for lending me these clothes.
Keep mine till l return and l shall give you another rupee.
Another? But you have given me none yet.
Have faith in the gods, my sister.
Some days are feast, others are famine.
Driver, can't find him anywhere.
Mustn't miss the train. Drive on.
An anna, O protector of the poor.
Just one little anna.
My mother is dead. My father is dead.
My brothers and sisters are young and foodless.
An anna, O protector of the poor.
Just one little anna.
Where's Mahbub Ali?
Begone. We make no room for beggars or gutter thieves. ls that the way to welcome a friend, Abul?
By the beards of my ancestors... you are the boy from Lahore.
Where's your master? l seek service with him.
Where would he be after sunset, except baiting a trap with that red beard of his?
Until he returns, give me a place by your fire.
Over there. ln the tall grass by the mango tree.
The price was to be 20 rupees,
Hassan Bey.
The other 10 when Red Beard is dead. lt is as we planned. l will show you.
See... l have arranged his saddlebags.
Always he sleeps near the fire with his head to the west.
Mahbub Ali!
Friend of all the world will give you a warning.
Never again will l use a shod horse for night work.
They pick up every nail and rock in the road.
Down. Keep down.
The night is full of eyes.
But for this meeting, your head would be full of holes.
Hold still, sire of all devils.
How far do you trust your head man?
As far as from thee to me.
He's plotting with a man disguised as a peddler.
They plan to shoot you.
-As l ride into camp?
-No, after you are asleep.
The plan is for Abul to kindle a fire near you... and make you an easy target.
Did you see this peddler's face?
As well as l saw it when he searched your belongings that night at Lahore.
Go back to my camp. l'll meet you there.
Be careful, Mahbub Ali.
Mahbub Ali does not die this night.
Salaam, sahib.
This is a world of danger to peaceful men like thee and me, is it not?
What have we here?
Cardamom cakes... and cinnamon.
Help yourself, sahib. lt's free.
My stomach is not yet right for it. l killed my first man when l was 15.
Tell me.
Did you find your lama?
At Benares they said he'd again taken to the road.
Colonel Creighton was very angry when you disappeared.
What l do during my holidays is my own affair. l'll return to St. Xavier's when it opens again.
But Creighton sahib knew that our paths would cross.
So he's ordered me to take you to Simla for a certain purpose.
But why Simla? What will l do there?
There you'll learn things that Creighton sahib... not even Mahbub Ali himself, can teach you.
Now let us break camp and avoid pointless discussions with the police.
You'll like being with Lurgan sahib. lt's a different kind of school.
Very different.
Why should l go to school?
Colonel's orders.
But it's the holidays.
Tell me, Mahbub Ali, as man to man... did you go to school in your holidays?
Frankly, as man to man, and as one horse trader to another... l never went to school at all.
Then why should l?
Because Colonel Creighton's a man to be obeyed to the last wink of his eyelash.
Lurgan sahib, is he one of us?
Well, he's....
''Us.''
What is this talk of us? l know you and others gather news for Colonel Creighton.
He tells it to the General, and then the armies march.
Do they, indeed? l'm no fool. l am not blind. lt is a game. The Great Game. ls it, indeed?
Very well, my friend.
And you will never speak of it again.
Remember... you've never seen or spoken to a certain Mahbub Ali... who sells horses... to one Colonel Creighton, whom also you've never seen. l like it not. l think l shall not go to this Lurgan sahib. l am here.
...seventy-nine, eighty, eighty-one.
You will stay with me until it is time to go back to the school. lt is an order. lt is an order.
Where shall l put this?
You will sleep here.
Are you afraid?
Afraid of what? l've seen things like this many times.
One day, l fell asleep in the museum at Lahore. l found myself locked in for the night.
Nothing happened.
Shake hands, O'Hara.
This is Wanna, my other pupil.
Wanna learns quickly.
Now come, O'Hara, let me see you match wits with him.
Bring me the tray.
Look at them well. Finger them if you like.
Get the number and their color in your mind's eye.
One glance is enough for me.
Ready?
How many stones did you see upon the tray?
That's easy. 26, perhaps 27.
-Tell him the correct number, Wanna.
-Thirty-four, sahib.
Look well this time, O'Hara.
The brown-red stones, the garnets, note their number.
Now, take your time.
And those milk-colored pearls... fix with your memory, the number of blue turquoise.
And see? There are only five cat's-eyes.
Now, that should be easy to remember.
-l've got it this time.
-But make sure.
Check and recheck.
Shall l cover them?
All right.
There are eight garnets... seven pearls... thirteen blue stones... and the five cat's-eyes.
-There are eight garnets...
-That's what l said.
...seven pearls... thirteen turquoise...
-and six cat's-eyes.
-Correct, Wanna.
-But you said five.
-l also said check... and recheck.
You should believe only your eyes... and not the voices of others.
This is a child's game, Mr. Lurgan. lt is part of a Great Game, Mr. O'Hara.
Bring Mr. O'Hara an urn of water.
-l'm not thirsty.
-l said bring Mr. O'Hara an urn of water.
There will be no more customers tonight.
Happy dreams, sahib.
Here, O'Hara. Catch!
Look down at the urn. lt will come together again... piece by piece.
First the big piece shall join itself to the two others... on the right... and on the left.
On the right... and on the left.
Look. lt's coming into shape.
Look. lt's coming into shape.
Coming into shape.
No. lt's smashed!
Yes, it is smashed.
Many would have seen it grow completely together again. ls it magic?
Yes, of a sort. lt's called hypnotism.
Tell me, did you not see it start to reshape?
For a while.
Then what did you do? l mean, how did you think? l knew it was broken, and l kept telling myself so.
And it was broken.
Has anyone ever done this sort of magic to you before?
No.
Then never let them do it again.
Remember... when anyone asks you to look closely at anything... and uses his eyes and his hands as l did... don't do it. l'm pleased with you, Mr. O'Hara.
Good night.
Now... name their numbers and their types.
Two Mohammedans, four sadhus, one Bengali, three Afghans....
Fourteen old flintlocks, six scythes... thirteen double-edged swords, five double-barreled pistols....
Well?
Oh, about 600.
More than half, say, 400 men... and the rest women and a few children.
Easy, Wanna. ln three weeks from today, l have to scrub it off.
You can tell your companions at St. Xavier... that the sun was strong.
That will do. l wish l could journey with you to Umballa and meet your holy man.
That which is between my lama and me is for no other.
-l don't see anything l really like.
-Have you anything else to show us?
Darling, you're very sweet, but there's absolutely nothing here l want.
We have now reached the bottom of the well.
Pardon, sahib. l have heard of a new pen that carries its own ink. Have you one? l don't see anything l like. Come along. lt would be of great use to learned man of medicine such as myself.
There are pictures of the pen in English magazines.
Without dipping in the ink, it writes like....
Look over my shoulder.
What do you see?
Only the afternoon shadows.
Since leaving the village of Simla... l have been followed.
Simla is far to the north. ln the line of duty, l was posing as a cab driver.
And l took from one of my passengers a very valuable communication... which must reach
Colonel Creighton urgently.
To throw those who follow me off the scent, l have traveled far... several times changed my appearance.
But still they follow me.
Well, you haven't lost any weight over it.
No? Continual fear fattens me.
Good day, Lurgan. l've come for my jade set. ls it ready yet? lt is indeed, sir.
Wanna!
Bring Mr. Fairlee's jade.
This is the type of thing l was thinking about.
Yes, of course. One moment, Doctor.
-Thank you very much, Mr. Fairlee.
-Good day.
Give alms for a holy man.
Spare an anna for my lama,
O protector of the poor.
Begone. lf you give to one beggar, there'll be 50 here within the hour.
He can curse as well as bless.
And l am a most fearful man, sahib.
Doctor, let me introduce my pupil... who's just completed his first course with me.
O'Hara is the name. lt is many years since l also was a pupil. l congratulate you on most efficient performance.
Except for one little thing, you had my legs pulled.
The chela's waist string is always of horsehair. Never of cotton. l shall remember that.
And you are wearing Hindu beads, not Buddhist.
Anything else?
The stain on your face should go higher into the hairline. l am going to Umballa tonight.
But in three weeks, l shall go back to school again in Lucknow.
Perhaps by that time the learned doctor... will be once more driving his cab in that fair city.
That is jolly dash good, Master O'Hara.
Umballa?
O'Hara's going there to meet his holy man.
He has permission to spend the rest of his vacation with him.
And could carry a message safely. l think this will cover the cost of the magic pen, sahib.
Creighton sahib will be at Umballa station tomorrow night... when the train from the north arrives.
When you give him the message, tell him... as soon as l can disengage myself from those who follow me... l shall be at my usual place to await his instruction.
Do you follow? l wish you all a jolly good afternoon.
Let us see how well you have learned.
Come to the window.
Tell me what you see.
The fat one pauses.
He uses a brass tray as a mirror... to watch a tall man with a rounded beard and a tall turban of a Sikh.
This man leans against a wall, eating an orange.
The fat one moves off briskly, followed by the man with the orange.
The man with the orange pauses, speaks quickly to two men.
The other men, describe them.
Well, the small one, 5'4'', l would say, turban torn on the left side... wears only one earring.
The big man has a scar on the left side of his face... running from the corner of his eye to below the cheekbone.
The men part.
Very good.
Remember the faces of those men. ln years to come, when you play the Great Game... it might stand you in good stead.
Here's the message.
Third-class ticket, Umballa.
My mother is dead. My father is dead.
An anna, O protector of the poor.
Blessed is the father of two sturdy sons.
But for their strong legs and their stronger arms... we would have missed the train.
Do you journey far, farmer?
To Umballa.
O protector of the poor, a half an anna. l have traveled a long way.
A half an anna, O sahib, please.
Keep your dirty hands off me!
Now go along with your business.
Without your help, sahib, l shall not go very far.
-May l live to spend it, O protector--
-Now, get along with you.
Stop that boy! He stole my watch!
Stop him!
All right, stand him on his feet.
Bring him into the stationmaster's office.
Keep the crowd back. l'll attend to this little thief myself.
Where did the fat man say he could be reached?
He said he could be reached at the usual place.
He'll be found at the northernmost house in the village of Camba.
-Do you know it?
-Oh, yes, sir.
Two days journey on the Grand
Trunk Road and a half a day to the south.
Right.
Can you remember a difficult message?
Well, l think so, sir.
Listen carefully.
Blue follows the green.
The gray is under the blue.
The red is to the right of the green.
The gray must go five leagues to the point of eight... and then return seven leagues to meet the red.
Repeat.
''The blue follows the green.
''The gray is under the blue.
''The red is to the right of the green.
''The gray must go five leagues to the point of eight...
''then return seven leagues to meet the red.''
Lurgan spoke very well of you.
-He was not exaggerating.
-Thank you, sir.
Now l'll tell you a real message. l want you to go to the fat man and say... that the two Europeans who are surveying the Khyber Pass... are not the geologists they claim to be.
Tell him to go with all haste and investigate.
And, if possible, to secure for our information... any maps or data they may have accumulated.
-Can you do this?
-Oh, yes, sir.
But what about my holy man?
Will he stay here?
No. You'll take your lama with you to Camba.
As the chela of a holy man, you will look less conspicuous.
But he might harm him, sir.
Why not leave that to me, Kim?
Now, you go meet your lama as arranged.
Oh, and just one thing: l want you to give me your word of honor... that you'll be at St. Xavier's in three weeks time... at the opening of term.
Yes, sir.
And when you've finished at St. Xavier's... this is yours.
Thank you, sir.
Now run along, and good luck.
Did any of you see the theft?
Sahib, with my own eyes, l saw his thieving hand... reach into thy honorable pocket.
We've got our evidence.
Take him to the police station and hold him as a witness.
You cannot arrest me! You cannot! l came as soon as l got your message.
R3 is dead.
-The fat one?
-Strangled by a rope.
There was one with the heart of a full-blooded stallion.
A brain, too, as big as his belly.
There will be a reckoning. l sent a message to him to go to the Khyber Pass... and investigate the two Europeans who are surveying in the Himalayas.
You must take his place.
-Did he receive your message before--
-l don't know.
There's been no word from Kim since he carried it. l've inquired everywhere, including the school.
He's completely disappeared. l am terribly worried about the boy.
Did he carry your message to the fat one in writing?
No. By word. l felt l could trust him.
You, too, are thinking perhaps that he was also-- l am thinking only that perhaps a boy has gone upon a man's mission.
-We waste time.
-Mahbub Ali, our ranks grow thinner.
Have a care.
Sahib, l am a man of peace.
Thank you, boy.
For only four annas, O sahib princes... a skin full of milk.
Four annas, sahibs. The man is a thief.
But it's fresh milk. We need it.
Are you bankers to pay such a price?
Here. Buy the milk.
What sort of milk can you offer?
Never have l seen such a mangy herd or such a thieving herder.
Mudhead. Thy mother was born under a basket.
-Three annas.
-Bury thy head in a dung heap.
We do not ask the price of the herd.
One anna.
Son of 10,000 maggots!
Two annas.
Save thy slimy voice. One anna!
-Two!
-One!
-One and one half annas!
-One anna!
Oh, you drive a harder bargain than a horse trader from Lahore!
One anna.
That one.
For one anna, l will pick the goat.
Mahbub Ali.
So... for such as thee, l sacrificed my beard. lf we were not watched, l would lash you until my arm wearied.
Then l'd take you to Colonel Creighton, who'd lash you with his tongue.
But am l not playing the Great Game?
The first order is to obey orders. lt's a miracle your throat isn't slit... and that which we're looking for, lost.
Turn your head to the last pack animal.
What we seek is in that kilta with the red top.
They draw maps and plans of fortified places.
And chart where landslides might be dangerous.
At each spot with the passing arrows... they plan a fort just to be held by a handful of soldiers. l've seen it marked so.
Do you know when the soldiers will come?
No. They speak together in a language my holy man called Russian.
Now the pattern is clear on the loom.
The northern tribes were the ones that brought war.
This time the lmperial Czar prods them in the backside.
But am l not playing the Great Game?
Could the fat one or even Mahbub Ali have done so much?
Tonight, when they sleep... you and the holy one will go down to the plains.
But they trust me. l've made myself useful.
They love me like a brother. l could get ahold of those maps.
From now on, you'll obey orders!
One anna.
May the milk sour in your belly, skinflint!
Good boy. Thank you.
Milk.
You skinflint!
Did the holy one hear what they said in the strange tongue?
Their hearts are glad because someone they expected approaches up the pass.
Did they say who it was?
Yes. Even at this distance, they recognize him... by the sign he carries upon his umbrella.
Boy, our fire. Hurry with it.
Tonight you cook well, very well.
-A visitor is coming.
-A visitor, sahib?
We have wine. Cool it in the stream.
With such complete preparations, this time we cannot fail.
And if our fighting tribesmen could be joined... by some of your master's soldiers--
There is peace between my country and England. lt is not possible.
Our imperial master will help with guns, ammunition....
We're expecting hourly the arrival here of several men...
-some of our best staff officers.
-Excellent.
You'll conduct these officers to your headquarters... where they'll be at your service during the campaign. lf their identity were ever discovered... my government would be compelled to repudiate them.
To be less conspicuous, they travel in the costume of your countrymen.
Your pardon, sahibs.
The milk of the goat soothes the belly and brings sound sleep.
Our bellies are still full of your good food.
Where did the sahibs find the boy?
He is young, but very attentive.
We did not find him. He found us.
Attached himself to us the very next morning...
-after our bearers--
-The superstitious fools.
After our bearers deserted us... because something frightened them in the night.
The boy was journeying in the hills with a lama.
A religious fanatic...
-searching for a sacred river.
-Yes, some mythical river.
Searching for a river in the hills?
-Yes.
-The old man is mad, quite mad.
And yet he can speak with us in our own language.
These lamas have the gift of many tongues.
Strange meeting. lt smells strongly.
Boy, bring back the goat's milk.
Here. Catch.
Oh, l am sorry, sir! l am very clumsy.
Look down at the cup.
Look down! lt will come together, piece by piece.
Piece by piece... it will come together.
You are from the plains?
Yes.
What are you doing in the hills? l serve my holy man who searches for a river.
You search in the hills for a river? lt is a sacred river.
You are lying. l do not understand, master.
Others have sent you to find out things.
We search for a sacred river.
Who sent you?
We search for a--
Wake up.
Where am l? l will tell you.
You are in deep trouble.
The boy resisted my will.
His senses did not leave him. l can tell by his eyes.
See? They are unchanged.
Why did you pretend?
Why?
Who sent you?
-Let me go!
-Why did you pretend?
-Let me go!
-Who sent you?
-Who sent you?
-Let me go to my holy man!
Tell me, who sent you?
Leave him for me.
We have our own way of loosening a tongue.
After you speak, you have but to throw the rope up... and you will be pulled to safety.
When wisdom opens your mouth, you have only to whisper. l shall be here.
Soon the muscles of your legs will no longer hold.
You will crash down many thousand feet.
Well, boy, speak.
Who sent you here?
So much courage in one so young must conceal a deep secret.
The moon is not yet high. l can wait.
Come, boy. ls your mouth still shut?
Already your strength begins to ebb.
An hour or so more... and a gust of wind will blow you off that ledge like a feather.
Come, boy. Speak!
Sahibs, welcome.
What is the meaning of this? lt's a long climb down the cliff. l've been waiting all night for your return.
Did you still recognize your friend when you found him?
Who are you? What do you want? lt was whispered in the bazaar that two sahibs... had crossed the Russian border into our land in search of knowledge.
That is so.
We are scientists.
We come here with permission.
We have it written here.
This expedition is for geological research.
Alas.
And all l find in here are plans for war.
Why, you.... lf any harm comes to us, you will answer to our government.
Sahib, failure in this life is seldom rewarded.
Your government would be the first to repudiate you.
And your journey down to the plains, tied to the back of the pack animals... will not be as uncomfortable as the questions you'll be called to answer... concerning the evidence in here.
Then there's the little matter of injuring a holy man.
For that alone, were l not a man of peace... l would take pleasure in slitting your throats.
Mahbub Ali!
Tribesmen are coming from the north.
-How many?
-Ten.
And they all carry the short-barreled rifles of sahibs.
When they arrive, it is you who will take an uncomfortable journey.
Give me that rifle. l'll give you only a warning, sahib.
To pull that trigger would only warn our men who approach.
Chela! lf only thou would take a little food, or even some water.
My heart is very heavy for my neglect of thee. l walked thee too far. l have not always picked good food for thee. l've not considered the heat. l have talked to people on the road and left thee alone. l have, l have.
But l love thee, Holy One.
Love thee.
My chela must not weep.
But l deceived your trust. lt was not in search of your river that l led you into the mountains... and brought injury upon you. l lied, Holy One. Lied.
Have l taught thee so little of the way?
Does thou really think that thou could've led me into the mountains... if God had not so ordained it?
Mahbub Ali and thy chela will take you to the plains... to a man of medicine.
No, chela.
For me, the journey ends here.
But because of my love for thee, there comes a voice which cries:
''What shall become of the boy when thou art gone?''
Follow not those whose feet lead to violence.
No.
Not even Mahbub Ali.
Return to the road of learning... so that thou, son of my soul, may stand prepared upon the threshold... of a new and better world.
O Holy One.
And when l can no longer see thy face... thy voice will reach me like a song.
Come.
Rejoice with me.
For through these hours of trial, my soul went free... and reeling like an eagle... passed beyond the illusion of time and space... and the things... that tell thee my hour of deliverance is at hand.
Oh, my chela... for me, the search has ended.
For the merit that l have acquired, the River of the Arrow is here. lt breaks forth as l said it would.
Oh, my chela.
Holy One, you have not the strength.
There comes to me the strength of the free and the sinless.
The wheel is just.
Stay thee, chela.
This is not yet for thee.
Keep thy feet upon the way... until we meet again.
Hello, Father Victor. lt's your father's regiment you should be joining, as they go to hold the pass.
When a young polo pony has played a hard game, and played it well... he should be allowed to rest in the pasture.
You will see to it, Mahbub Ali.
Where do we ride now, Mahbub Ali?
Friend of all the world goes back to the school of the sahibs.
Must l?
Father Victor said l should join the soldiers of the Red Bull like my father.
All in good time.
And... speaking of time...
Creighton sahib wanted you to have it.
How will you manage without me,
Mahbub Ali, when l am at school?
Well, l can but try.
Your beard grows slowly.
Yes.
But for you and others... it shall bloom again.

(music) ["The Shaggy Dog" plays]
[Man] Go on, get out of here!
Go on, get!
[Barks]
(music) [song continues]
[Narrator] This is a shaggy dog story.
It could've happened anywhere or to anyone.
It so happened that it happened to Wilson Daniels.
A man who loved people, but hated dogs.
Go on, get out of here. Get!
Go on, get out of here.
- Morning, dear.
- Good morning, dear.
Blast!
Yes, dear?
Ridiculous!
Of all the sickly sentimentality.
Giving a medal to a dog.
Don't get the paper in the butter, dear.
- Making a big hero out of him.
- What did he do?
Dragged a baby from a burning building.
Who couldn't do that?
Don't upset yourself, Wilson.
Dogs! Yapping and snapping at a man's heels.
Man's best friend. If I ever find the idiot who said that...
You must remember, sweet, that most people love dogs.
I suppose I'm a freak because I don't.
It's nothing to be ashamed of, dear.
Frankly, I think that dogs don't like mailmen because, because sometimes they bring bad news.
Animals sense those things, you know.
Freeda, I am proud of the 20 years
I've spent in the mail service.
Neither snow, rain, sleet nor dogs kept me from my appointed rounds, but those blasted dogs tried!
You were very brave.
- Where are the boys?
- They had breakfast early.
They're down in the cellar tinkering with something.
- What with this time?
- I'm not sure.
Is there something called an "issle interceptor"?
"Issle interceptor?"
You must mean "missile interceptor."
I've been thinking, as long as you're not taking a firm hand with Wilby,
- I've got to do something about it.
- What do you mean, dear?
That mess he got us into last week.
- Which mess was that?
- The one where he had the police throw the new dean of the divinity school in jail as a public enemy.
Oh, well... that was because of the picture on the bulletin board in the post office.
It did look a little like the new dean.
Now, what I propose to do about Wilby is...
Missile interceptor!
[Loud explosion]
Why is everything shaking?
Maybe you better switch it off, Wilby.
How can I switch it off?
I haven't switched it on yet.
Maybe we better take it off the launching site.
Yeah, hurry!
Never mind, it's too late.
Get the upstairs area cleared.
Hurry up!
[Explosions, rumbling]
Pop, could you and Mom go on outside now and sort of hurry, please?
Well, save something!
- Moochie, where's Wilby?
- He's still in the basement.
Come on, Wilby!
[Loud rumbling]
Well, I guess we've officially entered the rocket age, eh, Pop?
It'd be great to be up there riding it, wouldn't it, Pop?
I wish I was on it right now.
Wilson.
- Pop sure was sore.
- Yeah, I know.
I always seem to rub him the wrong way.
Wilby?
- Pop, how'd you get up here?
- I piled up some boxes.
Wilby, I'm sorry, but I want you to get rid of all that junk in the basement.
- All, sir?
- All of it.
Dismantle the workshop, bury the chemicals,
- and give away those gadgets.
- Yes, sir.
I want you to lose or give away all the mice, hamsters, bats, crickets, bugs, snails and whatever plagues of mankind lurk down there.
Get off this roof, both of you, before you fall off and ruin the flower beds.
Be careful, Pop, those boxes look rickety.
Thank you, I'll do all right. Thank you.
[Crashing]
We better get down from here.
[Car horn beeps]
Hi, Allison.
That's old knothead for you.
Always showing off.
The flowers! That's just what Pop said not to do.
- You all right, Wilby?
- Sure, I'm fine.
Buzz, may I talk to you for a moment?
Excuse me.
- Look, Wilby, I'm in a hurry.
- What about my seven bucks?
- What about it?
- Cough it up.
Pop pulled the plug on my allowance.
Look, I'm sorry, but you know how it is,
I got a date with Allison.
I'm sick and tired of financing your romances.
I'd like to take Allison out myself.
- You want a date with Allison?
- Why not?
Wilby, have you ever taken a girl, any girl, out on a date?
Well... not exactly.
Now you want to move right in on the most popular girl in town?
Buzz, are we or are we not going to play tennis?
- Coming. Excuse me.
- Just a minute, Buzz.
Great suffering cats.
[Speaks French]
What's she saying?
[Speaks French]
- What are you doing?
- Having a look at the new neighbors.
They're moving into that gloomy old
Coveny mansion.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
Give me my glasses.
Who are they, anyway?
He's the new assistant curator at the county museum.
A man by the name of Andrassy.
Dr. Mikhail Andrassy.
My reports aren't in yet.
But Murphy Jones who leased the place told me...
Don't tell me how you get your gossip.
What else do you know?
Well, he's supposed to be a well-known art expert.
He spent some time in a prison camp after the war.
Reason, unknown.
He worked in the famous Uffizi museum in Florence, Italy.
There is a daughter, 17 years old.
Been studying art in Paris.
How dare they bring a camel into this neighborhood?
No!
- It's a dog!
- [Barking]
A blasted, dreaded dog!
That is correct.
One Bratislavian sheep dog.
It's supposed to be a very rare breed.
- I'm moving into the back bedroom.
- Don't start falling apart.
You know very well that dog thing is all in your mind.
All in my mind?
I itch, my sinuses are ballooning up, my throat's constricting, so I can hardly breathe.
Those old Pekinese wounds on my ankle are throbbing like bongo drums.
It's all in my mind?
Well, if you say so, OK.
Come along. Why don't you just lie down and rest for awhile?
[Dog barks]
Wait a minute, what about my seven bucks?
What do you know,
I think he likes me.
That's his problem.
I'm interested in the mademoiselle who owns him.
You shouldn't be running across the street like that.
- Liable to be hurt.
- By golly, you're right, Wilby.
I'll bet she's worried about him.
I better take him back. Come on.
Wait just a minute, Buzz.
This dog came to me.
All right, come along.
Maybe ol' Buzz can teach you something.
All the nerve!
- Yes?
- We brought back your dog.
The mademoiselle's dog.
[Speaks French]
[Speaks French]
Me bring dog you.
Him, me. We do this.
What is it, Francesca?
Chiffon ran away and these two nice Indian boys brought him back.
Indians? This far east?
We're not... We're not Indian.
I didn't know you spoke English.
- But of course.
- My daughter speaks seven languages.
How many do you speak?
My name is Francesca.
And this is my father, Dr. Andrassy.
How do you do, gentlemen?
Bring that over here, please.
I'm Buzz Miller. This is Wilby Daniels.
He lives down the street.
Then we're neighbors.
Won't you come in?
I'm afraid you'll have to excuse the house. We're just moving in.
[Whistles] Boy, look at all this stuff.
Some of it is stuff.
But some of it's rather priceless.
Look, here's a Titiano.
A Tintoretto.
A Rodin and a Bernini.
This is a very fine piece.
A Forzini. Early 16th century.
Probably worth $3,000 or $4,000.
I believe there's an El Greco over there in the music room.
That's another Tintoretto.
I better put it over here out of the way.
Look at that.
I've never seen Chiffon take such a fancy to anyone.
He sure is friendly.
- Who's she?
- Lucrezia Borgia.
You remember the Borgias, of course.
Sure, who?
The Borgias were notorious during the Dark Ages in Italy.
Some people say the Borgia dabbled in black magic.
Black magic?
Hey! The dog in the picture is the same kind as this one.
Yes, a Bratislavian sheep dog.
The breed has mostly died out now.
Chiffon is one of the few left.
And it's very lonely for him.
Excuse me, Francesca.
Would you be good enough to take the Orsini artifacts to Dr. Howard at the museum?
Certainly, father.
Why don't I drive you down there?
My car's outside.
- Wait, we'll both take you.
- I'll get my purse.
What's the big idea?
I thought my driving made you nervous.
Look, the only thing about you that makes me nervous is my seven dollars, if you know what I mean.
All right, Wilby, if you want to come along, glad to have you.
Thank you.
- What a sweet little museum.
- It's not bad.
I've put in a lot of time around this place studying the arts.
Then how come you got lost getting here?
- Say, that's not a bad looking deal.
- [Answers in French]
Personally, I go in for the old Egyptian stuff like that.
That figures.
Francesca?
Buzz?
Buzz?
Buzz?
Buzz!
Uh, uh!
[Laughs]
- You scared me.
- You ought to be. Serves you right.
You shouldn't be wandering around until the exhibit is open.
I've worked nonstop to be ready.
I'm sorry, Prof. Plumcutt.
I was looking for my friends.
You know me?
Why, of course!
It's Wilby Daniels, isn't it?
Yes, I used to deliver your paper.
That's right. So you did.
Or did you? Come to think of it,
I don't recall getting my papers lately.
No, sir. I gave up my route two years ago.
Oh.
That just goes to show how often I read the newspaper.
Nothing interesting happens to people these days.
Now in the delightfully evil days of the Borgias here something interesting happened to people every day.
Yes, sir. I guess they did, sir.
I'd better...
Wilby, do you realize this civilization knew all about sorcery?
Even about shape-shifting and the casting of spells.
What's shape-shifting?
Shape-shifting was the medieval art of borrowing someone else's body to live in for awhile.
A most interesting practice.
You've heard about people being changed into cats, dogs and other creatures, haven't you?
Professor, you don't believe in this stuff, do you?
Well, it may surprise you to hear, my boy, that I do.
Oh, I know people laugh at these things today.
But if they were honest, they'd admit that there are moments on dark and lonely nights when something stirs within us.
And reawakens ancient fears and beliefs.
I'd better be going now.
I have to find my friends.
Yes. Come in and see me again.
Look out!
- Sorry.
- No, no. It's all right.
Look, Wilby...
Run along now, will you?
I'll take care of these.
- You're sure it's all right?
- Yes, please. Please.
Well, they say it takes all kinds.
- Then it's a date?
- It's a date.
Good deal.
I wonder what happened to Wilby.
Don't worry about knothead, he loves museums.
Bye now.
[Tires screeching]
Hi, Wilby.
Who gets the mice and the hamsters?
Pete Hammers, he always wanted 'em.
Mickey Warren gave me a buck for your chemistry stuff.
I promised to throw in
Harry the Bat for free.
What about ol' Zachary here?
I couldn't unload him.
Nobody wanted him.
Poor ol' Zach, I know just how you feel.
Come on, Wilby, quit feeling sorry for yourself.
Pop'll get over it.
Pop'll get over it, but I won't.
I'll still be the same mixed up guy
I've always been.
All right, boys, time for bed.
If you haven't finished, do it tomorrow.
Be right up, Pop.
- You coming, Wilby?
- In a minute.
What the heck is this?
How do you suppose...
I know. It must've fallen in when
I knocked over the professor's case.
"In canis corpore transmuto."
Sounds like Latin.
Wish I knew more than just first year Latin.
Canis, canis...
That's "dog." Dog.
"Into dog something," transmuto.
"In canis corpore transmuto."
"In canis corpore transmuto."
It's a transmuto and away we go
With the do-si-do
Wait a minute.
What's going on here?
Stop! Wait, somebody, whoever you are.
I was just kidding!
Wilby.
Wilby, come on, now.
It's getting late.
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
Wilby.
- Yipe.
- Wilby.
Oh.
Wilby. Come on up now.
It's getting late.
OK, Pop.
You catching a cold? Your mother told you to wear a sweater down here.
Sweater?
I've got a sweater.
Come on up now.
Oh, poor Pop.
This'll kill him.
What'll I do?
Gosh, what'll I do?
Professor Plumcutt! He'll know.
Now, to get by Pop.
[Hums]
[Wilby] Professor Plumcutt.
Hello, fella.
I've gotta talk to you.
You know, dogs are not allowed in here.
I'm not a dog.
I'm Wilby Daniels.
Wilby Daniels.
Are you really?
Well, well.
I'm not surprised.
The very first time I saw you,
I said to myself,
"That boy's a potential shape-shifter."
- Is that what happened to me?
- Of course.
How on earth did you manage it?
I think this ring had something to do with it.
The Borgia ring.
Where did you find it?
I've looked everywhere for it.
Well, uh, it fell in the cuff of my trousers.
Thank you very much for returning it.
It's a very rare and unusual ring.
Professor!
- What's the matter?
- What about me?
What about you?
I don't want to be a dog.
- You don't?
- No, of course not!
Can't you help me?
Yes, but how?
Apparently, you've become involved with some old spell cast upon this ring.
Probably by one of the Borgias.
It sounds just like them.
But how do I get out of it?
Don't ask me, my boy.
How should I know?
There are all kinds of spells.
Some of them break themselves after awhile.
While others come and go like a headache.
- Come and go?
- Yes.
Sometimes you'll be a dog, sometimes a boy.
For hours at a time, sometimes longer.
You never can tell, that's what makes it so interesting.
Well, how can I break the spell?
An act of heroism might break the spell.
Heroism?
Why, of course.
Why didn't I think of it first!
Heroism has always been an important, a most potent factor, in the breaking of spells.
- Do you remember the hound of Florence?
- Hound of Florence? No, sir.
Well, it's the famous story of a young man who was changed into a dog, just as you have been.
He was in love with a beautiful girl.
One night he got into a terrible fight defending her from an evil duke.
The duke grabbed a dagger and plunged it into the dog.
The dog fell to the ground.
As the poor little animal lay there with the dagger deep in his heart, he suddenly changed back into a man again.
Dagger in the heart?
That'd kill me!
No, you don't grasp the point of the story.
What I was trying to say is that it is possible to break such a spell.
Now you must excuse me, please.
I have work to do.
Isn't there anything I can do?
Yes, be happy.
And keep a stiff upper lip.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
[Radio] 1-L-2-9, Code 6. 1-A-7-9, over.
1-2-0-4-9, Roger.
All units on one, stand by.
- Sorry.
- That's all right.
- What'd you say?
- Hmm?
- I said I'm sorry.
- That's what I thought you said.
- Johnny.
- What's the matter with you?
- You see a dog that was just there?
- Yeah, why?
- Did you hear...
- Hear what?
Forget it.
Forget it, I said.
All right, then. I'll forget it.
[Gargling]
[Toilet flushes]
[Wilson hums]
Wilby, Moochie, time to get up.
Be right with you, Pop.
Hey, Wilby, I had the funniest dream last night.
I dreamed that you were a dog.
[Wilby groaning]
Come on, Wilby, wake up.
It was the greatest dream.
You came in this room as a big ol' shaggy dog.
Hey, Wilby, wake up!
Oh, boy! How'd you get in here?
What'd you mean, how'd I get in here?
I live here.
You talk just like Wilby.
I am Wilby.
No, you're a dog!
Where are you going?
Dog?
Oh.
It can't be true. No!
Do you think Pop'll let me keep you, Wilby?
Shut up a minute, will ya?
Let me think.
I'll be good to you.
Honest, I will.
Boy, we'll have great times together.
Great times together?
What are you talking about?
- Uh-oh.
- What's the matter?
- I hope Pop won't shoot you.
- Huh?
He swore the first time he caught a dog in this house...
[Wilson] You two better be up when I open that door!
Yipe. Here he comes.
Hurry, get under there. Come on.
All right, come on, you birds.
- Good morning, Pop.
- Good morning.
- How are you this morning?
- I'm very fine, thank you.
- Wilby.
- Pop, listen to this.
[Plays harmonica]
Very nice. Now, stop playing it and get dressed.
But, Pop, I just learned it.
Very good.
Now get dressed like I told you.
Wilby, I want you out of that bed, right now.
And you brush your teeth.
- That was a close one.
- Don't worry, boy.
Gosh.
Why did this have to happen to me?
It's just terrific, Wilby.
How'd it happen?
I don't know exactly.
Remember? We were down in the basement last night.
Uh-huh.
- Morning, dear.
- Good morning, dear.
Have you seen any dogs around here?
Of course not.
They wouldn't dare.
Are my eyes getting puffy?
You've always had puffy eyes.
I know that. They just feel like they're getting puffier.
Freeda, if I thought for a moment...
- Freeda, I hope I can trust you.
- What do you mean?
You're always telling me how much Moochie wants a dog.
Yes.
I know you two wouldn't gang up on me, but...
Sometimes I get the feeling you're not in sympathy with my problem.
Wilson, I think you'd better eat your eggs.
Did Prof. Plumcutt say you had to stay a dog all the time?
He didn't exactly know.
Gee, I hope so.
You what?
Gosh, Wilby. You know how much
I always wanted to have a dog.
Well, I'm not going to be your dog.
I'll teach you all kinds of tricks.
How to sit up, beg, roll over and all that stuff.
- Cut it out, will you?
- [Wilson] Boys.
You stay here.
I'll tell him you're not hungry.
Hungry? I'm starved!
You like nice meaty bones?
You know what I like. Hurry!
Don't worry, boy.
I'm gonna take good care of you.
Take care of me. Humph!
[Wilby] Psst.
Psst.
Pop?
What's this ad?
- Well, it's a sale on lawnmowers.
- Interesting, isn't it?
Yes.
How did you get in here?
Shoo, shoo.
Go home. Go home.
Don't you know it isn't safe for a dog in this house? Go!
- My toast.
- Coming up. Shoo.
- Freeda.
- Yes?
Is there a dog in the kitchen?
- A dog?
- Yes, dog.
- D-O-G.
- Dog.
What kind of a dog?
- That's all I wanted to know.
- Pop!
- Where are you going?
- To the hall closet.
- What for?
- To get my shotgun.
- You can't shoot your own...
- My own what?
- Your own neighbor's dog.
- Can't I?
- Pop, you can't shoot that dog!
- [Wilby] Oh!
[Gunshot]
Oh!
[Panting]
That's right!
Run, you cowardly flea bag!
Next time you come on my property, I'll...
I'll... Well, I just will!
I just don't understand it.
He's never stayed out all night before.
I'm sure he'll return for his meals.
If you'd watch him more carefully, these things wouldn't happen...
I'm sorry, mademoiselle.
There you are. Where have you been all night, you wretched beast!
Chiffon! Get down from there.
Chiffon, mon petit,
I've been so worried about you.
What have you been up to, villain?
Now, you're all forgiven.
Come on, how about some breakfast?
Well, since when do you eat at the table?
I'll get you some breakfast, come on.
[Doorbell rings]
Stefano, the door.
Yes?
Dr. Andrassy's expecting me.
My name is Thurm.
Yes, Mr. Thurm, come in.
Please follow me.
What's the matter?
I thought you were hungry.
Well, go on.
[Crunching]
Oh, no, you don't.
You get back in the kitchen.
- Stefano.
- Mademoiselle?
Take Chiffon.
See that he doesn't run away again.
- Do you understand?
- Oui, mademoiselle.
You're always causing me trouble, aren't you?
Get in there. I don't have time to watch you every minute.
Now, let's see you get out of there.
It's me!
It's me!
[Barks]
[Moochie] Here, Wilby!
Wilby. Here, Wilby.
Wilby.
Here, boy.
[Whistles]
Here, Wilby.
Wilby. Here, boy.
Here, Wilby.
Here, boy.
Here, Wilby.
- Wilby?
- What do you think you're doing?
Aw, gee.
What's the matter?
You're not a dog anymore.
You were gonna put this dog collar on me, weren't you?
You don't have to get sore.
Forget it.
I'm through with that dog business.
You sure?
No.
Where's Pop?
He's in there.
Cleaning his gun.
Well, I guess I'll have to hide these for awhile.
- Did you wash your hands?
- Yep.
Wilson, if you don't mind, we'll have dinner early tomorrow night.
We're all going to the country club dance.
- Is my good suit clean?
- I had it done last week.
Wilby, why don't you take a girl to the dance?
Wilby? He's a little young for dating, isn't he?
Nonsense, just because you didn't go out with girls until you were 23.
That's not true. I was 20.
Besides, I was shy.
Well, Wilby can't exist in a vacuum.
Besides, you've already taken all his hobbies away from him.
I'd say it was a big jump from bird's eggs to girls.
There is nothing wrong with girls.
They're character building.
Why don't you ask Allison to the dance?
Allison? Well, Buzz takes her to all the dances.
Oh. Then someone else.
There must be dozens of lovely girls who'd be delighted to go with you.
Why does he have to take a girl?
Why can't he go with me?
That's a great idea, that is.
Honey, why don't you take that new girl down the street?
Dr. Andrassy's daughter?
Francesca?
No, I wouldn't have a chance with her.
[Knocking]
See who that is, will you, Wilby?
Wilby, could I talk to you in private for a second?
You know, knothead... Wilby, you're the best friend I have.
Buzz, not a cent.
Now, I don't come to see you just when I need money.
All right, I'm sorry.
The point is, I do have a problem.
I'm supposed to take Allison to the country club dance.
I know.
I happened to mention the dance to Francesca.
You know how it is.
She's a smooth worker.
Before I knew it, I asked her to go too.
Well, what do you want me to do?
All you have to do is come and make a foursome out of it.
You don't have to be with anybody.
I don't get you.
Don't you see I'll handle it, so both girls think they're with me.
Then everybody's happy.
I don't see how that makes me happy.
Sure you do, it's fun.
We're playing a harmless little joke on the girls.
What do you say?
Anything's better than going with my little brother.
I just don't see how it's going to work.
Well, you just come along and watch the old master at work, buddy pal.
Oh.
Say, I'll need gas for tomorrow night.
You don't happen to have a buck on you, do you?
- How nice you look, Wilby!
- Thank you. So do you.
Thank you.
Don't bother getting out, Wilby.
I'll get your date for you.
Imagine, taking the prettiest girl in town to the dance.
Well, you know...
Francesca certainly seems to find you attractive.
You really think so?
Of course, I'm not as sophisticated as she is, but there is something about you lately.
Something unusual.
[Door closes]
- You girls know one another.
- Of course.
- Hello, Wilby.
- Hi, Francesca.
I think you both better ride up front with me.
The wind in the back is murder on the hair.
You're so thoughtful, Buzz.
[Speaks French]
Sorry, I don't speak French.
Oh.
[Swing music plays]
Allison, will you do something for me?
What is it?
Well, you know, this is Wilby's first dress-up date, and he's scared stiff.
- Scared of what?
- Francesca.
That's silly. She's his date, isn't she?
Sure, but you know how shy he is.
Francesca's kind of spectacular.
- It's got him tied up in knots.
- So?
I thought if you could dance the first dance with him...
You're old friends.
It might break the ice for him.
Since when are you so concerned about Wilby?
I like to see everyone happy.
Thanks, Allison, you're a real doll.
Wilby, aren't you and Allison gonna have the first dance?
Sure, how 'bout it, Allison?
Wanna dance?
Love to.
- Shall we?
- Oui.
They're sweet together, aren't they?
- That's what makes it so tough.
- What does?
Well, Wilby's got a tremendous crush on Allison.
Trouble is, he's so shy.
Allison goes more for the sophisticated type.
She can't see Wilby for sour apples.
Boy! He is very nice, isn't he?
Don't you worry, there's nothing you can do about it.
- Buzz, I have a rather amusing idea.
- What's that?
Suppose I make a little fuss over Wilby and pretend to be interested in him.
What, you mean make Allison jealous?
- Oh, just a little bit.
- Why, you're a genius.
I never would've thought of that in a million years.
Next number will be a ladies' tag dance.
Tag dance.
It's customary.
The custom, is it not?
- What's the big idea?
- You told me to break the ice.
Fine, break it. Don't melt it.
Excuse me.
It's amazing.
All those pretty girls actually seem to enjoy dancing with Wilby.
Why not?
I'd have bet anything he was going to be the all American wallflower.
There are a lot of things about your son that you don't know.
The next number is a Paul Revere.
- Shall we, dear?
- Love to!
Excuse us, Moochie.
No more cake, sweetheart.
Wilby!
Wilby!
Wilby!
- What's the big idea?
- Get down!
- Don't give me trouble, Mooch.
- You've got it. Look at yourself!
Oh, no! No!
Not here, not now, please!
Wilby, are you all right?
Oh, boy, you're a dog again!
What are you so happy about?
Gosh, Wilby.
You're a lot more fun as a dog than you are as my brother.
Shut up, and get me out of here.
OK, boy, I don't want anything to happen to you now.
[Whispers] Come on, sneak out that way.
Chiffon!
What in the world is he doing here?
- Who?
- Chiffon.
Chiffon!
- Get him, Buzz.
- Oh, yeah.
[Screams]
[Screams]
There's that blasted dog again.
Get away! What's he doing here?
- See you later, boy.
- Look out!
Come here, you mangy mutt!
Come here.
Come on, Moochie.
Time for bed, dear.
[Phone rings]
Hello? Wilby, where are you?
- Pop!
- Just a minute. It's a little late.
- Isn't time you get home?
- Is he all right?
Yes, he's all right.
We wondered where you went. I suppose you went chasing after the dog too.
Is it all right if you stay at Buzz' house?
- It's all right, Pop.
- Yes, it's all right.
Hey, Kelly, got a dime for the phone?
Whoops.
Sorry, Officer Hansen. Bye.
[Phone clinking]
Kelly, here's your dime.
Can we go now?
- I thought you were calling home.
- I changed my mind. Let's go.
- You said it was important.
- I know what I said. It was a whim.
Sometimes I'm just full of little whims.
Can we go now, please?
- But, you said...
- Forget it, I said! Forget it.
All right, I'll forget it.
Don't bother, Buzz.
- Good night. I hope you find your dog.
- Thank you, Allison. Good night.
Good night.
[Tires screeching]
In the words of your charming other date, don't bother!
- Wait, I can explain everything!
- Good night.
Well, that's gratitude for you.
I beg your pardon?
Here I almost break my neck trying to catch that dog of yours.
He drags me all over a parking lot and you won't even listen to me.
So?
Besides that I have a very deep cut over my eye and it'll probably be infected by the time I get home.
Oh, well.
I guess I don't blame you.
Come on inside. I'll clean your scratch.
Now you're talking.
What the...
What a night!
- Is Chiffon here?
- Yes, he just came home.
- He's in the kitchen.
- I'm quite displeased with you.
I distinctly asked you to keep Chiffon locked up.
I did my best.
I left him in the kitchen, locked the doors, he escaped.
We won't discuss it now.
Please go and sit down.
I want to check on Chiffon.
Will you forget about that mutt for once?
Like I said, it's Wilby's fault that I got into this mess.
- Wilby's?
- Yeah, it's all his fault.
Because I have a soft heart.
I was trying to do him a favor.
Ouch. That stings.
There, it's all done now.
Wilby didn't have enough nerve to get himself a date.
So, he cooked up this whole thing.
Why are you blaming this on Wilby?
Don't let him fool you.
He's not as dumb as he looks.
Behind that simple face...
Well, I don't want to talk about my best friend like that.
Let's talk about us.
You know, Francesca,
I've never met a girl like you.
No, I'm not kidding.
There's something about you...
[barks loudly]
Chiffon!
There you are.
What a bad dog you've been.
Running away again and scaring poor Francesca half to death.
Bad boy!
I sure hate to see you waste all that on a mutt.
Why?
What do you mean?
I mean, forget about tonight.
Forget Wilby and the whole mess.
Like I said before, let's talk about us.
You know, Francesca...
- the first time I saw you...
- [dog growls]
I said to myself,
"Buzz, there's just the girl for..."
[growling]
Does he have to keep looking at me like that?
Look, fella, I've had just about enough trouble for one night.
Now, beat it!
[Barks]
Would you get lost!
Buzz!
Hey, what's the big idea?
Get off, will you? Francesca!
Chiffon, stop it!
He flipped his lid.
Let go!
Get him off me.
What has got into you?
Now stop it this instant.
I think you'd better leave, Buzz.
OK, I'm beginning to get the point.
Your dog doesn't like me.
I'm sorry.
That's OK.
I can find my own way out.
Bad dog you!
- Good night.
- Good night.
You behaved very badly tonight, Chiffon.
Buzz is really a nice boy.
A little, shall we say, conceited?
Come on.
Yes?
- I just wanted to say good night.
- Did you have a pleasant time?
Yes, thank you.
The odd thing was I found Chiffon at the dance.
Chiffon was there?
I don't understand how he keeps getting out of the house.
- May I leave him with you tonight?
- Certainly, dear.
- I'm sure he won't get away from me.
- [Doorbell rings]
- Good night, Francesca.
- Good night.
Now you behave yourself!
You stupid, wonderful dog!
Thurm, what is the meaning of this?
You were asked not to come here at night.
It's most urgent,
I dare not use the phone.
Is anything wrong at the missile plant?
On the contrary, good news.
I've been transferred to section 32.
Section 32? Excellent!
With what I've given you, this should be all you need.
How soon can you get it here?
Taking all precautions,
I'd say tomorrow night by 8:00.
That means that the complete mechanism of the undersea hydrogen missile will be in our hands.
- Yes, sir.
- Now we must get it out of the country.
Immediately!
Oh, no, you don't.
No, you don't, my friend.
You're not getting out of this house tonight.
All right, up on the couch. Up!
Good night, Thurm.
I'll expect you tomorrow night at 8:00.
I certainly would like to know what has gotten into you lately.
Spies!
I've got to tell somebody.
I've got to get out of here.
The laundry chute.
Well, here it goes.
Easy. Easy.
What'll I do now?
- [Moochie] Hi, Pop.
- Wilby home yet?
No, sir.
What's this you're reading?
How To Train Your Dog?
Gosh, Pop. I thought some day you might change your mind about dogs.
Let me tell you something.
As long as I've got a mind, there'll never be a dog in this house.
How to train...
There.
Hey, Mooch.
- Is that you, Wilby?
- Who'd you think it was?
Gosh, boy, I've been worried about you.
Will you stop patting me?
I don't like it.
- Where you been?
- We've gotta get some help and fast.
That house is full of spies.
Spies! Swell, that'll be fun playing.
This isn't a game. It's serious.
Aw, Wilby.
Listen, they're stealing something from the missile plant.
The missile plant?
I don't know what it is, exactly.
But they call it, uh, Section 32.
They're sending it out of the country tonight.
Wow! I'd better tell Pop.
- Pop?
- Sure, he'll know what to do.
You just stay out of sight.
OK.
Pop, can I talk to you for a minute?
Certainly, what is it?
Will you please put down that paper?
It's very urgent.
All right.
- I just found out something.
- What did you find out?
You know those people down the street,
Dr. Andrassy and them?
They're spies.
Spies, huh? Well.
Pop, I'm not kidding. They're stealing something from the missile plant.
Something called Section 32.
Section 32? That's very interesting.
But, Pop, you gotta believe me.
We gotta do something about it.
I'm surprised at you. I knew we had one woolly-headed son in this family...
Wilby isn't woolly-headed!
He's the one that heard 'em talking.
He's the one that heard it.
That explains the whole thing.
Run along now, Moochie.
But, Pop, we can't just let 'em get away.
Run along.
Pop...
Moochie.
No hope.
I guess I'll have to give him the shock treatment.
Poor Pop.
Uh, where's the gun?
In the hall closet.
I got the key.
Well, here goes.
Pop?
- Yes, Wilby.
- I've got something to tell you.
But I'm afraid.
You never have to be afraid to talk to me, Wilby.
Maybe sometimes
I'm a little impatient with you, but that's because you're my son.
- I want you to be something special.
- Yes, sir.
You just tell me what's troubling you.
I'm sure it can't be anything too serious.
Whatever it is, I promise you,
I'll understand.
- Really, Pop?
- You can bank on it, Wilby.
Shake on it?
Certainly I'll shake on it, Wilby.
- No!
- Oh, that did it.
- [Wilson] Freeda!
- Wilson?
- Freeda.
- Wilson, is that you?
What are we gonna do now?
- We've got to get help.
- Look!
[Wilby] The police.
I'd like to report some spies, please.
All right, what's the name?
Montgomery Daniels.
Daniels?
Any relation to that kid who tipped us off about that gangster last week?
Yes, sir. Wilby's my brother.
But he didn't know it was the new dean at the divinity college.
Remember, Kelly, last week when I used to be a sergeant?
No kidding, officer. We need help!
Who are you?
Wilby Daniels.
Wilby Daniels.
I knew it.
I knew it, first time that dog spoke to me.
- I said to my wife...
- Easy, now. It's all right.
Probably some kid dressed up in a dog suit or something.
That's right, officer.
Sure! That's how he spied on the spies.
All right.
Take off the dog suit.
I can't, I don't have anything on underneath.
You see, Kelly, he can't.
- You ought to know that.
- That's enough, you two.
Stop bothering Officer Hansen before we take you down to the station.
- Fine, let's go.
- Yeah, let's go.
No, you don't. Not in this car.
But the spies!
I'm afraid they're gonna have to keep.
You see, there's a landing of invaders from Mars over by the stockyards.
I'm afraid we're going to get over there.
[Bell tolls]
Gosh, Wilby. 2:00.
We gotta think of something.
Yeah.
I got it!
Here you are, you miserable beast.
You can't take him. He's my...
Your what?
My pal.
This is the last time you'll ever get away, I can promise you that!
Come on, you devil.
Come along before I...
Come on.
- No.
- Wilson, Wilson?
Don't you dare move.
I'll get the spirits of ammonia.
Pop! Pop! Snap out of it.
We've got to get moving.
Oh, Moochie. Moochie...
Is it true about Wilby?
Did I see and hear what I thought I saw?
You sure did, Wilby's a dog now.
No.
My own boy. My own flesh and blood.
Somehow, some way,
I failed him as a father.
How did it happen?
- I'll tell you later. Hurry.
- Are we going somewhere?
Don't you understand?
We gotta get help.
- We gotta stop those spies.
- What spies?
Remember? I told you about 'em.
Spies! That's right, you did.
Don't worry about a thing.
I'm in this with you all the way.
- Come on, we'll have to get some help.
- Not that way! This way.
Wilson Daniels.
You close that door.
You're not leaving this house.
Stay out of this.
This is a job that calls for cool heads.
Here, this way.
Calm down, Mr. Daniels.
I just want to get this thing straight.
Oh.
Now, you say that this information came from your son.
Yes, my older son. He was right there and he heard them talking.
And they knew he was there?
I'm sure they knew he was there, but...
Doesn't that strike you as rather odd?
They'd speak of confidential matters in front of your son?
It's not odd at all, they probably didn't pay any attention to him.
You see, my son happens to be a dog.
Your son is a dog?
Yes. Don't get me wrong, he's not a dog all the time.
Just part of the time.
I see.
Well, uh, thank you for coming,
Mr. Daniels.
- We'll look into it.
- You don't believe me.
- Ow!
- I'm sorry.
I don't have my shoes on.
- Don't you believe me?
- Of course!
Aren't you gonna do something?
Well, we must proceed with caution,
Mr. Daniels.
Dr. Andrassy is a well-respected man.
But you haven't got time for caution.
This thing that they stole is being shipped out of the country tonight.
I don't suppose you have any idea precisely what this thing may be.
No, I don't. All I know is that it's something called Section 32.
- Something like that.
- Section 32?
- That's right.
- Are you sure?
That's what the dog said... my son.
- Please sit down again.
- Well, I should think so.
Now you still insist a dog told you about this?
Yes, why don't you ask my younger son, Moochie?
He's the dog's brother.
- Just now, it's you I'm interested in.
- Me?
You don't think
I had anything to do with this?
I came here in good faith. I told you a simple, straightforward story.
Just because my son happens to be a dog, you look at me as though...
As though I had wheels in my head.
Remember, I'm a government man myself.
We have the utmost respect for the members of the United States
Post Office Department.
I wonder if you'd mind repeating your story to one of my colleagues.
I'd be glad to. All I ask is that you gentlemen keep an open mind.
- You see, my side...
- Not them.
Would you step into the hall with these gentlemen, please?
Well... yes.
Excuse me.
It's fantastic, but he knows about Section 32.
- How could he?
- That's what I've got to find out.
Meantime, check every man, sketch and piece of equipment in that department.
- That'll take time.
- Get moving.
All right, Mr. Daniels, this way, please.
- I think you'll like Dr. Galvin.
- Doctor?
Oh, uh, it's a kind of honorary title.
Now, just a minute.
I've just returned from the museum.
I have our plan worked out.
Come upstairs, I'll go over it with you.
Yes, sir.
- Is my daughter at home?
- No, sir. Not yet.
- She went shopping.
- Good.
The girl must know absolutely nothing of what's happening here.
I understand, sir.
As it is with matters coming to a head,
I don't quite know what to do about her.
It is unfortunate she is your daughter.
Otherwise the solution would be obvious.
In any case, Stefano, the problem is mine.
I'll decide what to do when the time comes.
This is a sketch of the packing case containing the small fossils.
Understand me clearly.
From here on, the slightest hitch will be disastrous.
You can depend on me.
When Thurm arrives with Section 32, take them to my office at the museum.
There you will find the packing case containing the Etruscan fossils.
Suppose the authorities open the case?
They may.
But I doubt they will tamper with a fragile, priceless collection dispatched to such a distinguished man.
The packing case will be shipped on the midnight plane, consigned ostensibly to the museum in Rome.
You mean Anders himself will pick up the shipment?
Silence!
You have instructions never to mention his name.
[Stefano] What harm can it do?
Save for the dog we are alone in the house.
Very well. Suppose we go over what you must do, point by point.
- What are you doing here?
- Here?
Oh, here...
As a matter of fact,
I'm glad you asked me.
I was wondering if you'd give Francesca a message for me.
There's going to be a barbecue at Dawson's Grove next Saturday.
I was thinking...
I know what you heard and I know how to make you forget.
- Not now!
- What else can we do with him?
I said, not now! Tie him up and lock him in the dressing room.
[Doctor] You've gained access to certain secret information.
Now, fearful of the consequences, you transfer the burden of guilt to your second self.
A submerged second identity, known only to you.
What second identity?
This is very important, Mr. Daniels.
Do you often visualize yourself as a dog?
- What?
- Let's be honest.
Do you often stand in front of your shaving mirror and instead of your own face, you see a shiny, moist, black shoe-button nose?
A strong intelligent head?
- No!
- Excuse me, sir.
It's getting awfully late and Mom'll be worried about us.
I don't see any reason why you can't go.
- Good, I've had enough of this.
- I was referring to the boy.
I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to remain a while longer, Mr. Daniels.
- Just a few more questions.
- Why don't you ask him a few questions?
He knows more about this than I do.
He'll say I'm telling the truth.
Perhaps we should question the boy.
There may be a hereditary factor present between father and son.
Can't it wait, sir? I ought to be going.
Yes, they say heredity sometimes plays a role in lycanthropy.
Who are you calling a liar?
Lycanthropy is the alleged practice of turning humans into witches and werewolves.
Don't be ridiculous.
My son isn't any werewolf.
He's just a big, baggy stupid-looking shaggy dog.
Pop, I'm worried about Wilby.
- He may be in trouble.
- What do you think I'm in?
Now, just a few questions, my lad.
It won't be any good, sir.
I don't know anything about all this.
Moochie!
What did you say?
I said I don't know anything, and I'd like to go home, please.
Moochie!
Then, you don't believe your brother is a dog?
Gosh, sir, would you?
Moochie!
Your father made up this entire story about the dog, it was his idea?
Pop's a great storyteller.
Kids come from all around just to hear him.
Moochie!
Sorry, Pop. I had to do it.
Betts, I'm letting the boy go.
Please see that he gets home in a company car.
- Yes, sir.
- All right, son.
Moochie.
You go back to my office and Mr. Betts will take care of you. Go ahead.
Moochie.
- May I, Doctor?
- Of course.
Now, Mr. Daniels, we've had our little joke about the dog, suppose we get down to cases.
I want to know just how, when and where you found out about Section 32.
[Bell tolls]
- Did you get it?
- Yes, I have it.
- Section 32, complete.
- Good.
[Thurm] We're in trouble.
- Something's gone wrong at the plant.
- What do you mean?
An investigation, my name came up.
- I had to answer ticklish questions.
- You knew the right answers, I trust?
Of course, but I didn't the sound of 'em.
I'm not sure that I wasn't followed here.
We'll have to use the emergency plan.
The other is too risky now.
What about the boat?
It's tied up at Walker's Dock, ready to go.
Bring the sedan around.
What about the boy?
We'll be out of the country before they find him.
[Andrassy] I don't understand what went wrong.
You're sure that...
Yes? What do you want?
I wanted to say
I'm going out with Buzz Miller.
I'm sorry, but I've been called away for a few days and I would like you to come with me.
Isn't this rather short notice?
Where are we going?
I have no time for questions.
Get ready.
If you don't mind,
I'd prefer to stay here.
You'll do as I say!
What is this?
Francesca... you're an intelligent girl.
I don't believe
I have to make any needless threats.
Take her to her room.
See that she takes what she needs.
Hurry.
- Here you are, son.
- Thank you very much, sir.
We don't want to attract attention.
Drive at a normal speed.
Wilby. Here, Wilby!
[Whistles] Wilby!
Wilby.
Here, Wilby.
Wilby!
[Whistles]
Here, Wilby.
Here, Wilby.
Here, Wilby.
Wilby.
In here, Moochie! In here!
In here, Moochie! In here!
Wilby, what's going on?
Come on, they're getting away.
They're heading for Walker's Dock.
Hey, look out!
Some day I'm gonna murder that dog.
Hey, you mangy cur, come back with my car.
Wait, stop!
Officer!
Officer, get him!
Get him.
That shaggy dog just stole my car.
Shaggy dog?
It's no use, Kelly.
I've just gotta face it.
I gotta face it.
Follow that dog!
Hey, wait!
- Wait for us!
- Never mind, Buzz, here comes my pop.
Pop! Pop!
- Follow that police car.
- Don't you ever speak to me again.
Come on, you can't let him get away.
You don't know what you're asking me.
You know what I've gone through for the last two hours?
- It's my car.
- I'm not a well man.
Chicken!

They're headed your way.

What are you...
Well, it's possible!
Isn't it?

- Look out!
Ouch!
- [Hansen] He bit me.

You've got your instructions.
Bring in Hansen and Kelly.
Report mobile unit assigned to Hansen and Kelly passed this point a moment ago.
[Mercer] Officers Hansen and Kelly were not in it.
Really? May I ask who was in it?
[Mercer] A large shaggy dog, sir.
Description as follows:
Color, dirty white with brown patches.
Was driving the mobile...
Would you have them send my car around, please?
That is, unless it's been stolen by a purple kangaroo
- wearing a checkered vest. - Yes, sir.
No! No!
No, no, no, you idiots!
- No! No!
- Well, well...
If it isn't Hot Rod Hansen speeding!
And you who used to be a sergeant.
All right, Mercer, very cute.
- Come on.
- Sorry, we're to bring you in.
In? I can't go back without that dog.
Sorry, I got the word from Scanlon, loud and clear.
Please, for the love of a fellow officer.
We were rookies together.
I married your sister, Felice.
I loaned you my dress uniform for the Shriner's convention.
Ed, don't these things mean anything to you?
All right, I'll take a chance, Hansen.
You just better pray you know what you're doing.
[Andrassy] Cast off!
[Growling]
[Shouting]
Get down from there!
Chiffon, let go of me!
You devil you, I'll fix you.
No! Chiffon, look out!
Look out.
- Stop it, you...
- Chiffon, stop it!
[Screams]
Mercer, call the harbor police.
Have them stop that boat!
Ow!
- What's the matter?
- Go ahead.
I'm all right.
I've just broken my foot.
Did they get away?
Did they get away?
Where's Wilby?
Apprehend 32-foot speed cruiser headed towards Gilly's Point. Over.
You all right?
Buzz.
There, there, now.
Everything's under control.
How in the world did you get here?
The last thing I remember, Chiffon...
Don't worry your pretty little head.
OI' Buzz got here in the nick of time.
- But, Buzz...
- Don't thank me. It's nothing.
Nothing at all.
[Growls and barks]
What's the matter with you?
What's the matter with you?
Let go of me.
Wait a minute!
I didn't do anything.
Look out, will you?
Chiffon! Let go, you silly mutt!
Mutt. Ouch.
Stop it. Cut it out.
That's the man, Captain.
That's him.
No, no. I'm innocent.
No, no.
I'm innocent.
Look, I'll...
I haven't done anything wrong.
I'll explain the whole thing again.
You see, my boy is a dog...
[growling]
Saved her in the nick of time?
A great big hero, are you?
- Wilby!
- Good ol' Buzz?
Right in the nick of time, are you?
The great big hero, eh?
Wilby! Will you lay off?
I don't know what you're talking about.
[Wilby] Don't know what I'm talking about. I bet you don't!
Chiffon, it was you!
You saved my life.
Wonderful, beautiful dog.
My hero.
Over here with that.
You're in the way. You mind?
- No, not at all.
- Thank you. Now let's...
This stuff'll clutter up the picture.
Here. Mind holding these, please?
Thank you very much. Now...
Ed, get ready for a picture.
A picture for our Sunday follow-up story.
A human interest angle.
How your love for dogs made this whole thrilling thing possible.
Fine.
Mr. Daniels, If you'll sit on the arm of the chair.
All right, boy, up in the chair.
Now, just a minute!
I will not have that dog on my good chair with his dusty feet.
Oh, don't worry about it, honey.
A dog can't hurt anything.
How 'bout me with my arm around him like this?
Fine.
This all right?
That's fine.
Now, how about one with your son?
Why not?
Come here, son.
Not you, the little fella.
Come on, Wilby, let's talk a walk.
You stay just like that. Good.
Mr. Daniels, you be looking at your son.
That's fine.
Anyway, sure was nice of Francesca to give us the dog.
That old house is sure gonna seem empty with her gone back to Paris.
Yeah. Swell girl.
Oh well, I guess it's all for the best.
I was getting tired of all that
French lingo anyway.
Wanna know something else? I don't think we've been fair to Allison.
She's a swell girl, too.
Yeah. Good sport, real good sport.
Anyone else might've gotten sore.
Hi, Allison!
[Horn honking]
You know them?
Oh, just a couple of neighborhood children.
[Car zooms off]
- Let's get the medal in this picture.
- Medal? What medal?
Valor award?
Well!
No, no, no, Mr. Daniels.
The medal is for the dog.
Oh.
- There.
- That's good!
Well, I finally got a dog.
What do you mean, you got a dog?
We've got a dog.
[Barking]
{{{THE END}}}
Hear that?
Might say I was raised on that song.
Hearing it takes me back...
back to the old times when I was young,
Back to Walesburg.
According to the song,
we're promised a city of gold in the hereafter.
I used to think that was a long time to have to wait.
But I know now that there is a city of gold
right here on earth for every one of us,
the city of our youth.
Walesburg's only one name for it; that's all.
Walesburg not as it is now, but as it used to be.
I just have to shut my eyes, and I'm there.
Nothing's changed.
Even I haven't changed.
I'm always a boy in Walesburg.
And there at my side, just as he'll always be, is the parson.
Parson Gray.
Passing before me are all the people who were a part of my growing up,
People like Mrs. Belcher, who took in boarders,
and her niece, Faith Samuels, the district schoolteacher.
Sweet, pretty miss Samuels.
Did you hear that, John?
Granny Gailbraith, who could remember seeing George Washington.
Thad Carroll, who had served as drummer boy at the first Bull Run.
Lon Backett, who kept the general store and had a finger in every pie.
Even Chloroform Wiggins.
His ma had never heard of chloroform until he was born,
and she thought it was a mighty pretty name.
And all the others,
Walesburg people...
Gone now, most of them,
and yet as close to me still as people in a favorite story...
A story that had its beginning before I was born,
on the day the parson arrived in our town.
This wasn't much of a town then
in those first hard years that followed the war between the states,
but it suited the parson.
Right from the minute he stepped off the train
and started to look around.
He must have attracted plenty of attention
as he walked down main street for the first time
in his brand-new black pulpit coat
and faded gray cavalry breeches
and his big old Bible in his hand.
But he just kept on walking till he got to.
Jerry Higgins' saloon.
He didn't have to call for quiet.
It just followed him through that room like a hound dog.
Boys, I'm your new preacher, and I aim to give my first sermon right here and now.
Thanks.
Now, seeing that this is as new to me as it is to you...
I reckon we'd best begin at the beginning.
"In the beginning was the word,
"and the word was with God.
And the word was God."
From that day on,
Walesburg and the parson kind of grew up together.
He preached around in back rooms,
and he prayed in parlors,
and he led the singing in barns.
* Shall we gather at the river *
* Where bright angel feet have trod *
* With its crystal light forever *
* Flowing by the throne of God *
* Yes, we'll gather at the river *
* The beautiful, the beautiful river *
* Gather with the saints at the river *
* That flows by the throne of god *
And by the time work started on the parson's church,
his victory was won.
Just about everybody in Walesburg took a hand in that church building.
And if ever a house of god or man was put together with loving hands,
this one was.
Yes, the parson's church is one of the nicest parts of the parson's story.
And now I was in the story, too.
Had been ever since
I could remember.
My parents had died when I was small,
so I'd come to live in the parson's house,
sharing the parson's heart with the parson's wife,
who was my aunt Harriet.
What's this?
Dinner not ready yet?
Garfield, we better get a new cook.
Enjoy the service this morning, Harriet?
Well, now I'm glad to hear that.
Everyone else was saying what a good service it was, too.
John Kenyon, you know you don't have to do everything the parson does.
Yes'm.
You know, to tell you the truth,
I found it pretty good myself.
- Don't you laugh at me, Mr. Gray.
- Why, Harriet, honey, what gives you the idea
I'm laughing at you?
I am standing around with a big smile on my face just 'cause I feel good, and you-
Yes, well, all I have to say is:
You should be ashamed of yourself.
I was brought up to believe that a man who broke his solemn promise to a lady was a pretty poor sort of a man.
Oh, Harriet, I guess you found me out.
I am a pretty poor sort of man.
I was intending to mention it sooner.
Something always came up.
This morning was just the last straw.
You promised me time and time and again that as long as I played the organ for the services,
I could choose the hymns.
So I have.
Yes, and promise is all you do.
Never mind what I want to sing;
What anybody else in
Walesburg wants to sing.
Oh, no, week in, week out, it's that old "stars in my crown".
I like "Stars in my crown".
Oh, I know you do, Mr. Gray.
I assure you, it's common knowledge.
Never hear the last of it in this world.
And if you have your way, it'll be the same in the next.
John, you put those shoes and stockings right back on.
They make my feet hot.
I don't care. You're not going barefoot on the Sabbath.
It isn't respectful.
- Aw, Garfield.
- Language?
Now, John, do exactly as your aunt Harriet says.
Any woman who can bake a chocolate cake as good as this deserves all the consideration she can get.
Now, Harriet, honey, about this hymn business.
It's for you to say what you want done and for me to do it.
Don't be shy about expressing your desires.
Just speak right up, and I won't open my mouth... except to do the preaching.
If the day comes when you don't open your mouth...
That's my last word, Harriet- except to do the preaching.
* Will there be any stars *
* Any stars in my crown *
* When at evening the sun goeth down *
* When I wake with the Blessed *
* In those mansions of rest *
* Will there be any stars in my crown? *
After the parson and my aunt Harriet, the most important people in my world were Uncle Famous Prill and his old dog Belle.
Uncle Famous knew everything about hunting and fishing, and I don't guess there was a boy or man in Walesburg who hadn't had him for a teacher.
* Any stars, any stars in my crown *
* when at evening the sun goeth-*
Hello, John.
Hello, Chloroform.
Hello, uncle Famous.
Chloroform.
Where are y'all going?
Fishing.
That's where I thought you was going.
Well, good-bye, John.
Bye, Chloroform.
Bye, Uncle Famous.
Chloroform.
Boy, possess yourself.
Leave Mr. Frog be.
He ain't gonna help you catch no fish.
Oh, they ain't biting today.
Maybe they ain't, and maybe they is, but I just seen a big old catfish come sneaking this way.
I know just what he's thinking.
He's thinking,
"Uh, that old man, he's too smart for me,
"but that boy, he's so taken up with Mr. Frog,
I'm gonna grab his dough ball and just scat away."
Now, how'd you know he was thinking that?
I been on close terms with catfish ever since I was big enough to scratch myself with my left hand.
If I don't know what they's thinking, who does?
- Where'd he go to?
- He didn't say.
Oh, there he is now!
Get out the way.
Oh, that's a big one.
Stand back, now, stand back.
Well, bang my time.
I done spake in pride, and the lord had his ear out and heard me.
Go on home.
Your mammy wants you.
Famous, I'd like to talk to you.
Howdy, Mr. Backett.
Hot.
Yes, sir.
Famous, got some good news for you.
You know that mica vein I've been working on my 60 acres near your place?
And making a mighty good thing out of it, too.
Well, that vein has run smack-dab into your property line.
Found out about it this morning.
Now, what do you say to that?
Well, sir, I don't know.
I don't see it's anything to do with me.
Why, it's your property, ain't it?
It ain't my property.
If I don't get title to that land,
I'll have to close down the mine.
So, here I am with a little proposition.
60 cents an acre, cash in hand, or you can take it out in credit at the store.
Done?
- Sell my land?
- That's the ticket.
Well, sir, thanks all the same, but
I been making out on that place a sight of years now.
Yes, but that isn't what I asked you.
Yes, sir.
What I mean is that...
Well, I reckon I'm just too old to make a change.
Not enough money for you, huh?
Sir?
Now, no hard feelings.
Mind you, I like a sharp trader,
I always did.
Only wished I was one myself.
I'll give you 80 cents an acre, provided you take out half in credit at the store.
- Well, sir-
- 80 ct. an acre, that's 80 times 20.
That's $16, Famous, more money than you ever seen.
Mr. Backett, let me ask you something.
- I got this here suit of overalls.
- Yeah.
I got a long-tailed coat for Sundays.
A house, got a bed, and I gets my vittles
3 times every God's day, don't I?
Yeah.
Mr. Backett, what does I want with $16?
Now, you look here.
The boys I've got working for me ain't gonna blame me when the mining has to stop and their good wages along with it.
It ain't me they'll be throwing down on when their family has to do without.
No, sir, I wouldn't want such as that on my conscience.
Think it over, Famous.
Yes, sir.
Watch your pole, boy!
Get ahold of it! Get ahold before he takes it away!
Hook him out of there!
Pull 'im!
Pull 'im!
That's right.
Look at that! That's a cat.
Catch his mouth and watch his fins.
If he pinch you, he'll poison you.
Your hand will swell up like a puff adder bit you.
Get away from there, Belle!
That's a nice one.
Well, well, many happy returns to the day, son.
Howdy, Famous.
Howdy, Parson.
Just met Lon Backett driving off looking mad enough to bite himself.
Is that true about his mica vein going over to your side of the fence?
I reckon it's true, right enough.
People are telling it like it's a big joke.
Myself, I don't think it's so funny.
I don't want to make no trouble for nobody, Parson, but that's my place.
I ain't never had no other.
What's going to happen to me if I has to sell my land?
Uncle famous doesn't have to sell, does he, Parson?
You're a free man, Famous.
That's right, uncle Famous
'cause the law says.
Just saying a good thing don't make it so.
Lon Backett puts me in mind of an old foxhound I used to have name of Governor Dobbs.
Old Gov had a voice like a $12 bugle, and he loved to use it.
Seemed he wasn't just happy enough to live unless he could tell everybody what to do.
Got to where every time
I turned him loose in the pack, he'd start giving tongue whether he picked up the scent or not, just to prove he was top dog.
Some folks are like hounds in that respect, I reckon.
- Good story.
- Don't rush me.
Trouble was, when it come to trailing,
Ol' Gov never did know a buck rabbit from a bumblebee.
You know what that fool dog did?
He led the whole pack plumb into a flock of skunks.
Ah, I guess Lon Backett will have to kick up an almighty big stink before he learns his lesson.
You ready to go, John?
I thought we'd stop by the
Isbell place on the way home.
Come again soon.
We'll sure do that.
I guess the parson and I had been out to the Isbell place a hundred times.
The parson used to say the Isbell farm was everything a farm should be.
Hey, Jed.
What's more, he acted like he thought.
Jed Isbell himself was everything a man should be...
Anyway, almost everything.
Well, now!
Climb down!
Get a drink of the best well water in the county!
- How's that game leg of yours?
- Just tol'able, J.D., just tol'able.
A lot of folks thought Jed Isbell was a strange friend for a preacher to have.
But then, the Parson and Jed had fought side by side from Fort Donelson to Missionary Ridge.
The war had welded bonds that nothing, it seemed, could break.
- How you been there, J.D.?
- Fine, fine.
Guess you ain't heard the news.
Hey, Chase.
Jed, you got enough tow-headed sons to start a Swedish Sunday school.
Howdy, Parson.
What was your news?
Nothing special, I just bought 40 acres of bottom land from the widow Matthias, that's all.
More land?
The boys talked me into it. They felt that I wasn't keeping 'em busy enough.
It was a good buy, prime soil.
I figure we'll get a bale an acre off of that land.
You'll do it, all right.
You got the Lord on your side.
Don't you know that by now?
Well, now let me see, Parson.
I don't remember taking on any extra hands lately.
Just me and the missis and the boys.
And two good mules named Sam and Ike.
I think we'll get along without any help from the Lord.
Well, folks can get along without eyes, too, but they can't see.
Come on, John.
You boys ought to take better care of this old billy goat, keep him out of fights he can't win.
See you, parson, good-bye, now.
- How are you, Sarah?
- Just fine as silk, thank you, parson.
- My, don't they grow!
- They sure do.
- These are for Harriet.
- Thanks.
And I'd be obliged if you leave this soup for old Doc Harris.
Tell Bessie just to add water.
Can you remember that?
Remember that, John.
When you coming to church, Jed?
Just as soon as you get God to plow that bottom land for me.
Shame.
I'll see what I can do.
Get along, josh!
What's the matter, Chloroform?
Why you running away?
He's not gonna hurt you.
Don't you let him hurt you, Chloroform!
Now, Perry, I didn't say you couldn't knock it off.
I just asked you not to do it.
You said I couldn't.
Isn't that what he said, boys?
That's what he said.
Sure did, he sure did!
Did you see that?
He's scared!
He's right scared.
Now, Perry, I was just joking all the time. Perry, I...
I think I'll just draw your picture on that wall.
Now, now, Perry, now, PE...
Say, Perry,
Don't you think that's about enough?
It's enough when I say it's enough.
Pick up your hat and get out of here.
Perry puts me in mind of a colonel I had once.
He never learned to protect his rear.
Doc?
- Well?
- Well, Dan Harris.
You just get home?
I arrived in Walesburg last night.
I take it you came to see my father.
I have a present for him from Sarah
Isbell. You just add water...
Well, he's resting.
He can't be disturbed.
- He's not worse, is he?
- He's tired out.
So am I; half the town's been here today, and the other half will come tomorrow.
He can't improve under that kind of treatment. Nobody could.
I'd appreciate it, mister... if you'd spread the word that we're not holding open house here.
Well, don't get excited, Dan.
We want him to get well as much as you do.
Give him a chance.
Please stay away from him.
If there's any messages-
Dan!
You, Dan, who you clamoring at?
That the parson?
Yes, sir, it's the parson.
Well, send him out here.
It's me he come to see, not you.
Side porch.
Well, good to see you at this hour.
Sit down, sit down, put your feet up.
I'm afraid I can't stay.
Oh, you don't want to pay no attention to Dan.
I was treating heart cases before I met his mother.
Put your feet up and be comfortable.
You sure there's anything wrong with you?
You look spryer than a jaybird to me.
The fact is, if you want to know it,
I've walked out of my front door for the last time.
Next time I make the trip,
I'll be riding in style, and you'll be helping to carry me.
For once, doc,
I hope you're wrong.
Well, for once I ain't.
Here's Dan come to chase you away.
Calls himself a doctor.
Well, I learned more medicine holding ol' Doc Gilbert's horse than he'll ever know.
Here, what... what are you doing?
I'm entitled to one pipe a day, ain't I?
One pipe a day, Parson.
Doctor's orders.
It's warm.
You ain't no doctor.
You're a dadblamed detective.
And quite a stranger in Walesburg at that.
We're hoping this time he'll take off his hat and stay awhile.
Oh, Dan's home to stay this time,
- ain't you, Dan?
- If you say so, pop.
Yes, everything's ready for you- ready and waiting.
You won't even have to change the shingle.
We don't have to talk about it now, do we?
Walesburg won't be needing a new doctor for years yet.
Well, don't do no harm to make plans, son.
I remember the day you was born.
I ran up and down the street like a short-pantsed kid, telling everybody I met,
"Got another doctor in the family now."
I never did make a plan that didn't have you in it.
But somehow lately, my feelings for you are kind of getting all mixed up with my feelings for this town, the folks in it.
I've lived so close to 'em and taken care of them so long, they're almost as much my family as you are.
Well, you look after them for me...
You and the parson here.
Now, pa, don't...
Yes, Bessie, what is it?
- Someone wants the doctor. I told-
- You tell them the doctor's resting.
- Well, who is it, Bessie?
- The widow Smith.
She's got pains in her chest again.
She's bad.
Annie Smith?
Reckon you'd better go, son.
I don't know about that, sir, they asked for Dr. Harris.
Bessie, you're a fool! You go and tell them Dr. Harris is coming!
Well, son...
I wish it was anybody but Annie Smith.
That's one case he ain't likely to win, and it's good to win the first time.
I reckon I don't have to tell you that, parson.
I reckon you ain't forgot the first time you got up to preach down yonder in Jerry Higgins' saloon.
Come to think of it,
Dan's worse off than I was.
At least I didn't have your shoes to fill.
Yeah, he'll fill 'em all right.
Right now, he's a little long on education and a little short on sense.
He's got a lot to learn.
Even with that, he's a better doctor than I am.
Don't you tell him I said so.
Got a match?
Well, I may as well smoke here.
No smoking in the hereafter.
* My savior comes and walks with me *
* And sweet communion here have we *
* He gently leads me by his hand *
* For this is-*
* Oh, beulah land, sweet beulah land *
* As on the highest mount I stand *
* I look away across the sea *
* Where mansions are prepared for me... *
Parson, you're wanted over to the widow Smith's.
How's Annie?
Not so good, I'm afraid.
What do you want?
I've come to say a prayer for Annie.
Mrs. Smith's very ill.
If you really want to help her, you'll leave her to me.
Parson?
Parson?
I'm right here, Annie.
Parson...
It's all over.
No, doctor, it's just beginning.
You can go in now.
The rest of you had better go home.
Here, you, what have you done to your hand?
Dropped the stove lid on it 2 days ago.
Don't amount to nothing.
It will amount to something if it isn't properly attended to.
Why haven't you seen a doctor?
Doc Harris is sick, ain't he?
You call around tomorrow.
I'll take care of it.
Don't amount to nothing.
- Dan?
- Good night.
Dan...
I was thinking of a saying your father has.
He says if the Lord wants a person bad enough, it's not up to him to stand in the way.
Mr. Gray, we'd better get something straight right now.
I love and admire my father, but that doesn't mean that
I have to accept his ways.
As long as I'm doctor in this town, you'll oblige me by asking my permission before you interfere with my patients.
I don't know about interfering.
I came out here tonight because
I was sent for, same as you.
We'll be meeting like this right along and you may as well get used to it.
Souls don't always enjoy perfect health, you know, any more than bodies do.
Well, I'm not interested in souls, Mr. Gray.
And when I want a sermon on the subject,
I'll come to church for it.
Good. I'll be glad to preach you one.
Well, that'd be a waste of your time... and mine.
Good night.
Good night, Dr. Harris.
Yes, he's right here.
Someone to see you...
Dr. Harris, this is Bobby Sam Carroll.
Bobby Sam, quiet down, dear.
The doctor isn't going to hurt you.
We've had a little accident with a fish hook.
Yes, where?
Why, at the Sunday school picnic.
Oh! oh, it's caught in his leg.
You see, it won't come out this way because of the barb, and it won't come out this way because of the eye for the fishing line, you know?
Yes.
Bobby Sam!
I'm afraid some of the older boys have been frightening him.
With stories about me?
Never mind.
Now, John, what did I tell you?
Nothing terrible's going to happen.
John was showing
Bobby Sam how to cast, and the first thing...
Dr. Harris!
Let me have one of your hatpins.
Look here, stop that!
Now, look.
This is you, and this is that fishhook sticking into you.
Now here's the eye.
That's for the fishing line, you know.
Now, I'm going to take and cut the eye right off that hook like this.
Then I'm going to pull the shank out with one pull, like this.
See? That's all there is to it.
Now, you won't make a fuss about a little thing like that, are you?
* 10 green bottles hanging on the wall *
* If one green bottle should accidentally fall *
* There'd be 9 green bottles hanging on the wall *
* 9 green bottles hanging on the wall *
* 9 green bottles hanging on the wall *
* If one green bottle should accidentally fall *
* there'd be... *
Bobby Sam: 8!
* 8 green bottles hanging on the wall *
8 green bottles!
Some other time, Bobby Sam.
Come on, pinhead.
Oh, and we're very grateful to Dr. Harris, aren't we?
Don't mention it, miss...
Samuels,
Faith Samuels.
I guess I was still in short dresses when you went away to study.
I'm the schoolteacher now.
I live next door.
Miss Samuels, what makes you think
I never saw a fishhook before?
Why, I didn't say-
Do I impress you as the sort of man.
Well, who isn't the sort of man who goes fishing?
- Well, you-
- Do I, or do I not, Miss Samuels?
Yes, you do.
I see.
Thank you.
I have to go in.
Why, Dr. Harris.
Miss Samuels,
I came to inquire if you would care to go driving with me some morning fairly soon.
I thought maybe we might take a lunch and go as far as Tom's creek.
We might even do some fishing.
Why, I...
I would be delighted.
Good. We'll start tomorrow at 8:00.
Folks wondered what a sweet girl like Faith
could see in young Doc Harris.
I guess the only person who knew the answer to that
was Faith herself.
As for young Doc,
when he drove her home that afternoon,
he drove slowly,
as though he didn't want the day to end.
* 10 green bottles hanging on the wall *
* if one green bottle should accidentally fall *
* there'd be-
But the happy day was forgotten
when he saw the silent crowd in front of his father's house.
Don't they sound plain all of a sudden?
Wind's freshening.
I know it.
Pa had a hound once, chased a fox for 10 days.
Only give up when he died of starvation.
Pa says I'm named after him-
Chase.
Aw, that's just a joke.
I know it.
Sounds like this old fox is working his way around that hollow in back of uncle Famous's place.
Most likely got his hole up there.
Most likely fixing to hole up.
You don't have to tell me all that's happening.
I wasn't telling you.
All right.
On the way home, you want to stop by and see uncle Famous?
What for?
Aunt Harriet made a big pan of gingerbread yesterday.
- I brought him some.
- Maybe it's all gone.
It was a big pan.
Sounds like that fox changed his mind about holing up.
Sounds like he's doubling back across Uncle Famous' place.
I know what it sounds like.
I was just talking.
You don't have to listen.
Famous!
Come on over here.
Famous, what's been happening here?!
Some kind of accident?
No, sir,
I reckon it wasn't no accident.
Told you how it'd be when I had to close down the mine.
No, sir, it'ain't in nature for men to sit quiet whilst the bread's took out of their mouths.
Famous, I tell you what I'll do.
I'll make you one more offer for this land of yours.
50 cents an acre, cash on the barrelhead.
- What do you say?
- Mr. Backett, that's uncommon kind.
Aw, no, it ain't nothing.
But I told you before
I couldn't see no reason why I should sell my land, and there ain't nothing happened to change my mind.
Nothing's happened?!
No, sir.
Why, your stock's gone, ain't it?
Your stores is gone.
Your feed and green crop, your corn crop.
Where you fixing to get money to buy seed to plant again?
How you aim to restock and rebuild?
How you gonna live?
Where's the money coming from?
Why, you old fool, you'll starve to death!
Tom...
Go on home and fetch some seed corn out of the crib.
Cabe, tell your ma we'll be wanting some chickens and all the bacon and meal she ain't got any use for.
Jeb, we'll be needing the mules and the plow.
Rolfe, you and me better start cleaning up this field.
Mr. Isbell?
Just don't mention it, don't mention it.
No, sir.
You's a real Christian, sir.
When you coming to church, Jed?
Hup! get along there!
Hey, if you was God, what'd be the first thing you'd do?
Heap of things.
No, I mean the first.
I don't know.
What'd you do?
Well, first off,
I'd make it so it was summer all the time.
No Christmas?
Oh, I'd have it in the summertime.
I'd have everything in the summertime...
'cause that's all there'd be, just summer all the time.
Gee, what about school, though?
There wouldn't be any school.
Whoever heard of having school in the summer?
Whoever heard of having
Christmas in the summer?
Well, God could do it if he wanted to.
Gee.
Another thing. If you was God, and it was summer all the time, and there wasn't any school, what would the schoolteachers do?
I don't know. I haven't come to that yet.
But I know one thing.
There'd be wars all the time... fighting every day, but nobody'd get killed.
Who'd win?
Well, my side, of course, and I'd be the general.
And I'd ride around on a white horse just like Robert E. Lee, and I'd never wear any shoes.
That ain't fair.
You'd have all the fun.
What's the good of being God if you can't have all the fun?
Pinhead.
Hey, here comes somebody.
Hurry, close the well up.
It's the enemy.
Hurry up!
I'll only be a minute.
Faith, can't I have an answer, a real answer this time?
Look, I've done everything you said.
I've waited.
I've tried to be patient.
Dan, please.
I know what I'm asking.
I'm asking you to leave this town, your home where you've lived all your life and where you're loved and secure.
I'm asking you to give all of that up just to be with me.
All I want is to be with you.
You know that.
* Oh, them golden slippers, oh *
* them golden slippers *
* golden slippers,
I'm gonna wear *
* 'cause they look so-*
John!
Yes, mum?
Have you got your new shoes on?
Let me see you walk in them.
Hurry up, now, I want those shoes broken in before school takes up.
Why do I have to wear those shoes to school anyway?
They don't make me any smarter.
Well, we can always hope. walk!
Here's the parsonage, Professor.
Good morning, buckaroo.
Your pa to home?
He ain't my pa.
Well, whoever he is, tell him I want a chin with him.
Yes, sir, I'll fetch him.
Hold on, there.
What's that sticking out of your ear there?
Parson? Parson?
Parson! Parson!
A man just pulled a watch out of my ear.
- Parson Gray?
- Yes, sir.
Your servant, ma'am.
Parson, I'm Sam Houston Jones from the panhandle of Texas...
A businessman, sir, as you can see.
My line is to make folks happy inside and out.
Now, in pursuit of my policy,
I'll put on a little entertainment tonight, and I'd be obliged if you'd share in the festivities.
I'm prepared to give your church
10% of the proceeds if you do.
Isn't that a little unusual?
Nothing unusual about it, just stimulates confidence.
If I can tell the folks in these parts that their parson's coming, they'll know it's all right for them to come.
What does your entertainment consist of?
Well, sir, there's a band, there's Frank and Zeke there.
Play any kind of musical instrument.
Frank sings too, like a cross-eyed meadowlark.
I'm the featured attraction.
I do magic tricks and give educational talks, illustrated.
With a free sample.
What do you say, parson?
Well, I'm sorry, mister.
Uh, Professor Jones.
I'm afraid I can't accept your kind offer.
However... if you should decide to come at my church next Sunday and put something in the collection, that's your business.
And, of course, if I decided to bring my family to your show tonight, that's my business.
I won't promise to buy any medicine, though.
Oh, come here, buckaroo.
Come here, son.
What in the world have you got in your other ear?
Why, it's not in your ear at all, there it is right there.
Uncle famous.
Evening, Famous.
- Evening.
- Evening, parson.
Step aside, folks, and let the parson pass.
- Evening, Mrs. gray.
- Good evening.
Good evening.
Is that a new hat, Ms. Gray?
No, it isn't new. It's just my old one with a different ribbon on it.
Step this way, folks.
Right this way.
Let the parson in there, please.
Hey, Jed.
Hey.
How's that game leg of yours?
Tol'able, J.D., just tol'able.
Maybe you ought to buy that medicine.
They say it's good for old folks.
Don't seem to help you much!
I don't think that's very funny.
What's the matter?
You feeling bad?
Ain't this a silly way for a full-grown man to make a living?
All right, now let's get it nice and quiet here, folks.
Quiet down.
Nice and quiet.
My friends, you are about to witness for the first time on any stage, a feat of black magic, legerdemain, and sleight of hand taught to me by an old Indian friend.
A feat astounding, confounding, and pretty near impossible...
You wait and see if it ain't.
I'm gonna require the assistance of some young gentleman from the audience.
How about you, buckaroo?
You'll lend a hand, won't you?
Come on up here.
Don't be shy.
You don't have to go up there if you don't want to.
That's it.
Well, it's the parson's boy.
My goodness sakes.
Fine husky boy you got here, parson, yes, sir.
What have you got in under there?
Just a minute, let's see.
What in the world is this?
Just look at that.
Look at that!
Does this belong to you?
Now, don't you let it worry you.
You just stand...
He's got something in here, too.
What is this?
Hold on. Look at that:
Sausages.
3 sausages, 4 sausages, 5 sausages-
A whole crock of sausages.
What do you know? He brought his supper along with him.
You hungry, buckaroo? Of course.
I never seen a boy your age that wasn't.
We're gonna do something about that.
Bring on the fixings, boy.
Yes, sir. Lookahere, buckaroo.
Are you game to sample some of my celebrated specialty,
Professor Jones' popular 'n penetratin' pickapoo puddin'?
Won't take but a minute to throw it together here.
We'll just put some flour and some water in there,
Then some fine old aged pickle juice.
Put that right in there.
Pulverized apple core, and some essence of old rubber overshoes.
Any of you ladies out there like a recipe of this unusual dish, you're welcome to come around after the show.
Just bring along your paper and your pencil and some smelling salts, that's all.
Now a pinch of baking soda.
We'll put that in there.
Some melted candle wax, and how about it, men: wouldn't you like something different for a change?
Sure would!
Well, you just ask for delicious, pernicious pickapoo puddin'.
Now I will finish it off with a dash of this famous pickapoo extract.
We'll garnish it with a tail feather of a tom turkey.
We'll let it simmer awhile, put the lid down on it tight closed...
Hold that, boy, will you?
Now we'll repeat the magic formula.
Abbadickadabba duzza duzza buzza da buzzadabaloo presto change,
And there's your pudding.
Well, don't you want to see how it turned out, son?
Come on, let's have a look at it.
That's all today.
Thank you very much.
Now, if you folks will gather in here a little bit closer, when you hear the name of my product,
Old Jones's lodestone tonic,
Well, friends, there are just
3 words I want you to remember.
What are these 3 words, my friends?
"There is hope," that's what they are.
Now, friends, I don't care what's your ailment...
Be it the lights or the liver,
Be it the nerves or the organ,
Be it recurring, malignant, epidemic...
Fetch young Doc Harris.
He didn't eat much supper to speak of.
We thought it was just the excitement of the show.
I'm afraid it's typhoid.
- Slow fever?
- What can we do?
Not much.
Keep him as comfortable as possible.
Give him a spoonful of this if he gets restless.
And ice when the fever's bad.
Now, listen.
He's young, and he's strong.
He's got everything on his side.
With a little luck, there's no reason why he shouldn't come through this.
Let's go down to the creek.
Let's go swimming.
Let's have a drink.
I'm thirsty, awful thirsty.
The sun's so hot.
Let's put our heads in the water.
You haven't slept for days.
I'm gonna put you to bed.
I'm not tired.
Just lie down a little while, honey.
I'll be right here all the time.
I'll call you if anything...
Remember what the doctor said?
It's up to John now.
That's the way.
Days sure seem like years at a time like this.
All I can think of now is the times
I wasn't sweet to him, the times I spoke sharply to him.
I don't know if he always understood.
A little boy doesn't always understand that you love him and still speak sharply to him.
It's so hard to know.
He's always been just the same as my own to me...
Just exactly the same.
Maybe it hasn't been the same for him.
I suppose it's foolish of me to think it could ever be the same.
Don't talk, honey.
I just wish I'd been sweeter to him, that's all.
He's such a good boy.
He's never done anything really bad.
I just wish I could tell him what a good boy he's been, what a blessing.
Harriet!
Aunt Harriet?
Yes, dear?
I'm hungry.
* will there be any stars, any stars in my crown *
You're going to be late, Mr. Gray.
Come on, up, up, up.
What about you?
You going to church like that?
I'm playing hooky today, like you.
Mr. Gray...
Plenty of time, Harriet, plenty of time.
Oh, you always say that. Here.
I declare, Mr. Gray, I could get your whole... congregation ready for church... before I could you.
Well, Harriet, you have to admit the result's worth the bother.
You don't sound like you mean it.
Maybe you're still looking for that straight stick.
That's such an old joke.
Gonna miss your sweet voice today.
Sometimes you sound like a ribbon drummer.
Now, go.
John, keep your window open, you can hear the singing.
Are you gonna sing
"stars in my crown"?
I think that might be arranged.
Don't you cut your eyes at me, you two.
I know what you're thinking, and it won't do you a particle of good.
Gussie Lou Lyles is going to oblige you at the organ, Mr. Gray, and the hymns are all picked out.
Would you like to know what they are?
You see, John? You can't get ahead of your aunt Harriet.
Straight stick, indeed.
Straight stick what?
Oh, it's just an old story.
I never heard it.
It's about the young men who used to come call on me.
Tell me the story, aunt Harriet.
Well, you see, before I met the parson,
I was never satisfied with any of the suitors who came calling.
I used to laugh at them and make jokes about the way they acted.
Finally, my mother said to me:
"Harriet, I once knew a man who went walking in the woods
"looking for a good, straight stick to make into a walking cane.
"He hadn't gone far before he found
"what he thought was the proper oak limb.
"But as he went to cut it,
"he noticed it wasn't quite straight enough to suit him.
"I'll just look a little longer, said the man.
"And it was the same with every tree in that wood.
"The first thing he knew, it was dark,
"and he'd spent the whole day in that wood, and he didn't have anything to show for his trouble."
Mama said:
"Harriet, that's the way you are about men."
"Why," she said, "every man born
"has something the matter with him.
"And if you're looking for the perfect man, you'll never find him."
But the minute I saw the parson,
I knew mama was wrong.
Aunt Harriet?
Yes, dear?
You know, I'm glad
I live with you and the parson instead of with a ma and pa like other boys.
Did you hear what I said?
* Will there be any stars, any stars in my crown *
* When at evening the sun goeth down *
* When I wake with the Blessed*
*in the mansions of rest *
* Will there be any stars in my crown? *
I was still in bed when school opened,
but the parson went down as usual to start the term off in style.
Now, there's one thing more
I'd like to ask you.
How many of you say your prayers regular?
Fine, fine. That's first-rate.
Just so you don't get to leaning so hard on God's help that you forget how to help yourselves, puts me in mind of a time...
I think it was in the battle of Chattanooga in '63...
My horse fell with me, see, and
I had to make a dive for cover.
Well, I lit right alongside this old tobacco-chewing lance corporal.
He looked at me laying there on the ground, and he looked at the Bible sticking out of my pocket.
He says to me: "Son,
"just 'cause you're a prayin' man don't mean you don't have to keep your hind end down."
Well, I know it's been a long summer, and you're all anxious to get back to your books.
I think those books will keep for one more day, don't you, children?
Class dismissed.
Mr. Gray, I'd like a word with you.
May I ask what you're doing here?
May I ask why you're asking?
Use your head, man.
There's typhoid fever in your house.
If you don't want to spread it, go home and stay there.
Now, wait a minute.
Slow fever comes from bad drinking water, not from bad preaching.
Or even from good preaching.
Kindly allow me to know my business.
- Did you visit John this morning?
- Yes.
When talking to him you sat on his bed, touched him?
Yes, I suppose I did.
That makes you a potential carrier.
Don't you realize that?
Don't you realize that by coming here you have exposed these children and miss Samuels to infection?
You can stop right there.
Sure, I've been going in and out of John's room. So have you.
I've been going about my business, paying calls and making speeches.
So have you.
If what you say is right, they ought to lock us both up.
How long could this town manage without me or somebody like me.
Who'd do my work?
Who'd do mine?
School had hardly opened when it had to close again.
Faith Samuels was down with slow fever.
And in no time, lights were burning till daylight all over town
as the sickness spread and kept on spreading.
You're late, Mr. Gray.
I stopped by the Isbell place.
Chase has got slow fever.
Chase too?
Don't say anything to John.
I never saw Jed in such a state.
He's scared.
Wanting to yell for help, not knowing who to yell to.
To tell you the truth,
I'm scared myself.
Come and eat.
7... no, 8 cases this week.
Faith Samuels, Kim Aldridge,
Effie Meyers, both the Ware girls,
Little Carol Bowie,
Bobby Sam.
And now Chase.
And tomorrow, someone else, unless we find the source.
We've got to find it.
When Mr. Backett came by with my provisions,
He said he thought it strange that you hadn't thought to examine the school well.
If Lon Backett had half the brains he was born with, he'd know it couldn't be.
John came down with the fever first.
That was before school even started.
That's so.
This chicken pie is good.
Chicken pie?
Why, Mr. Carroll.
What is it, Thad?
The missis sent me, parson.
It's our Bobby Sam.
He's...
Parson, will you come?
Of course I will.
Go in if you want to. I've given up trying to tell you what to do.
But there's a child dead in that house who might be alive if it weren't for you.
You've said enough!
He's dead.
- I'll go straight over.
- No, wait.
I told you, didn't I, about having words with Dan Harris down at the schoolhouse?
Happened again tonight.
He has a notion all this is my fault.
He's pretty near got me believing him.
How does he mean, your fault?
He means I picked up the fever from John and passed it on to the other kids somehow.
Even gave it to Faith.
And no telling how many others.
It isn't true.
Who are we to say it isn't true?
He's a doctor, he's a good doctor.
He knows his business.
I guess I should have listened to him, but he riled me, kind of.
Now I keep thinking maybe he was right.
Maybe he's been right all the time, only now, it's too late...
Too late for Bobby Sam, anyway.
Harriet, what am I going to do?
You're going to keep on, of course, the same as always.
With all this trouble, now's the time when people need you most.
- They...
- You know what Dan Harris told me?
"Go home and stay there."
I wasn't man enough to do it.
I can't say whether I'm man enough to do it now, but...
I aim to find out.
Tomorrow, though.
The services?
There aren't gonna be any services.
"Services will not be held at this church
"until further notice.
"We ask your prayers for the sick.
J.D. Gray, Pastor."
When the parson closed the door to the church,
he also closed the door on himself.
It was all he could do now for the folks who trusted him.
The rest was up to young Doc Harris.
So, in a way, you see, this unhappy time was
young Doc's real homecoming.
Now, for the first time, he knew how good it was to be needed;
Good to be watched for and welcomed like a trusted friend.
It was even good to go red-eyed and dog-tired,
snatching sleep wherever he could on the road from house to house,
in order that others might sleep easier because of him.
He just couldn't go on feeling a stranger among folks
whose lives had suddenly become a part of his life.
It's all right. He'll recover.
Oh, thank God.
The lucky ones, like the Isbells,
whose faces spoke their thanks to him better than any words.
And the others, like Kate and Harry Ware,
whose sorrow was his sorrow.
I did all I could.
I know, doc.
I reckon what we need now is another kind of help.
Then it began to seem to young Doc that perhaps he too
stood in need of another kind of help.
But beyond that lighted window, if he'd only known it,
was a man in deeper need than his.
All that we had in those days came from the people of Walesburg:
The house that sheltered us,
the food we ate, the clothes we wore.
But what we learned to value most was none of these things.
It was the living faith in the hearts of those who gave them.
We'd never been rich- except in that.
And now, we were poor indeed.
For days, no one had come knocking at the parsonage door.
And for the first time since I could remember,
there wasn't enough to eat.
If you're going out, put on your other coat.
Did I mention I was going out?
I thought you might be going up to the burying ground again.
They buried the Ware child today.
I saw the rigs go by.
I thought I would go up there.
Mr. Gray, it's been nearly two weeks now.
Won't you write the bishop to send somebody?
Somebody to do my job for me?
It's still my job.
If the folks want a change, they'll ask for it.
It's for them to say, not me.
I reckon you're thinking they'll do just that before long;
Maybe even hoping they will.
No.
John believes in you, the same as I do.
That ought to be enough for any man.
Any man except you.
You don't have to make any pretty speeches to me.
If John and I were enough for you, you wouldn't be who you are...
I know that.
And what you want now is much more than we can give you.
More than food or shelter or praise or love,
What you want is your town back again.
* it was good enough *
* for my father *
* it was good enough for me *
Well, boy..
Come in this house.
I ain't laid eyes on you in so long,
I was near 'bout 'fraid you'd forgot me.
I've come for Belle.
Is she here?
My belle?
Well, you ain't fixin' to go huntin' this time of night, is you?
Yes, I am. We need...
Well, aunt Harriet, she wants me to.
You better step inside.
I'm standing in a breeze.
I've just come for Belle.
Well, Belle, she ain't accepting invitations just now.
Look at what's happened since you was here last.
What's the trouble, boy?
Who told you about any trouble?
Your face is doing the talking.
I can't help it.
It's awful at home.
It's just like being in jail- only it's worse than being in jail,
'cause we ain't done nothing.
Why does there have to be such a thing as slow fever?
What's it good for, except to hurt people?
We can't know everything, honey.
Might be good in it yet.
We're just obliged to wait and see.
But I've waited, and I still don't see.
Well, the slow fever ain't no new story.
I reckon it's kind of like the sow thistle in the field...
Just bound to crop up every now and then.
I've known water just as sweet and clean-looking as you'd want to see give folks the slow fever.
Seem like that fever will get into a creek or a well in spite of everything.
Couldn't be the creek.
I never drank any of that creek water.
I ain't said it was the creek.
Facts is, when I first heered of them children taking sick,
I said to myself right off,
"That school well is done diseased." but I reckon-
What?
- I said...
- No, I mean about the school well.
I mean, maybe that was the cause of it.
Oh, I reckon not.
I reckon they examined that well...
What's ailin' you?
Boy, where are you runnin' to?
John Kenyon!
John?
I know what gave everybody the slow fever.
Take it easy, son.
It was the school well.
Uncle Famous got some puppies.
Can I have one?
It couldn't be the school well, dear.
The parson thought of that first thing.
Don't you remember you were taken sick a week before school started?
But I drank out of the well.
Say that again.
Honest, I did.
I was up there one day with Chase Isbell, and we didn't know the well had slow fever in it.
Harriet, where's my hat?
Now, who's gonna notify Gene
Caldwell to board up that well?
I'll notify him.
Good.
Tell him to meet me out there.
We'll do the job together.
John, when you've done that, you'll help me spread the word around town.
You, too, honey.
We've got to make certain that well's done all the damage it can do.
Parson, they want you over to Mrs. Belcher's.
I reckon miss Faith Samuels is a-dyin'.
Faith?
John and I will tend to things. You go.
Sure.
Who sent you, Chloroform?
Them over to Mrs. Belcher's.
But who?
Was it Mrs. Belcher?
Oh, no, parson. Young
Doc asked me to fetch you.
Thanks.
Evening, Mrs. Belcher.
Mr. Gray, I sent for you because I know she'd want you to be here.
There's nothing more I can do for her.
Please wait outside.
Once you asked me to leave a sickroom.
Now I'm asking you to leave one.
"This is your last chance.
"You've got 24 hours to clear off this land.
"Get off, or get a rope around your neck.
We mean business.
The nightriders."
Let me see.
Can't understand it.
Just can't understand it.
Why, there ain't a man for miles around that I ain't knowed as well as I know this boy here.
You still don't want to sell?
I don't see how
I can do that, parson.
That's my property.
Everybody knows it.
If I've got to die,
I'll do it on my property.
Mr. Backett?
This persecution of uncle
Famous has gone far enough.
- You call...
- Now hold on, parson.
I'm a churchgoing man but that don't give you the right to interfere in my business.
Right now, Mr. Backett, your business is interfering with mine.
I'm asking you, before God.
Don't you realize what you're setting out to do here?
Murder one old man, steal his property, take your cut, and then call the job done?
It won't end there.
Don't think it.
You, all of you...
Where have you been in the last weeks?
Haven't you seen the slow fever at work?
Haven't you seen one poisoned well spread grief and trouble through half the town?
The poison in that well was catlap compared to this.
If that poison's allowed to start, it'll spread until there isn't a whole soul or a healthy conscience left in Walesburg.
Well, I aim to see...
You wait and see.
There'll be no rope around anybody's neck as long as there's one man of us left to stop it.
Nightriders!
Yellowbacks in fancy dress.
You shame me, and you shame the Lord that made you and called you men.
And if I wasn't his servant, I'd take a buggy whip to the lot of you.
We gonna take that from him?
- We don't want no preacher-
- Shut his mouth.
If he wants a fight, let's give it to him.
Kind of looking forward to tonight.
Rolfe tells me you run into trouble with Lon Backett's crowd.
That's one way of putting it.
Well, is there enough trouble for 6 of us?
Oh, Jed, you never change, do you?
Ha ha!
Just like old times.
Well, I brung you a horse, so get your pistols, and let's go.
I'm not taking my pistols with me this time.
Afraid I might forget myself and use 'em.
Well, that's what they're for, ain't they?
Maybe, but it's not what I'm for.
Lord knows, I want you boys along...
Want you bad. But if you want to come, you'll have to come like I tell you, and on my terms.
So I'll just take charge of those guns.
Oh, now, lookit here.
You ain't got a friend in that crowd since this morning.
And if you want to spoil their party, you'll need some care taken of you.
I figure I'll be taken care of, all right.
Oh, J. D. Gray,
I don't know you no more.
When are you gonna shuck off that long tail coat and be a man again?
When you comin' to church, Jed?
Oh-Come on, boys.
Take care.
I'll never forget how I felt that night
as I watched the parson set out, leaving me behind.
But I knew the way to uncle
Famous's as well as he did.
And if his town had failed him,
that was no reason for me to do the same.
Come on out, Famous, or we'll come in and get you!
All right, let's fetch him.
You're wastin' your time, parson. He ain't got a chance.
Stand aside.
Stand aside, parson.
Come on out, Famous!
Wait! Wait a minute, all of you!
And before you men go any further, there's something I'd like to take up with you.
Mind you, I'm not out here to try and talk you out of anything.
If you're still determined to do this thing,
I don't know of any way I can stop you.
I came out here to...
Uncle famous!
Don't let them do it, parson.
Don't let them!
Let go of me!
Parson! Parson! Why don't you stop them? you gotta stop them!
You got to!
You got to!
He don't belong here, anyhow.
You didn't let me finish.
I came here tonight because uncle Famous asked me to.
He knows he's got to die.
But like everybody else, he wanted to get things straight with God and man before he goes.
We've prayed together, and we've talked together.
Uncle Famous has even made a will.
A will? A will?
Who's gonna get his property?
Yes, who's gonna get the mica vein?
Just so there won't be any argument,
I'm gonna read the will to you right in front of uncle Famous.
And after you've heard it and know it's really his, you can go about your work.
The will is in Uncle Famous's own words.
It isn't in lawyer form, but just as he spoke it.
"I ain't been able to put much by in this life,
"but the things I has,
"I wants to go to my friends.
"My house, I leaves to Mr. Ernest Cumberly,
"whose daddy give me my freedom.
"I couldn't leave this world without leaving
"something to old Mr. Cumberly's son,
"and next to my freedom, my home is the thing I values most.
"I wants my fishing poles to go
"to Mr. Clem Elkhart.
"When he was a little boy, I teached him how to catch sunperch.
"He didn't have as good luck as I did,
"and I told him it was
'cause I had a magic pole.
"His eyes used to shine at that.
"Maybe now he can catch some fish.
"I sure wants Mr. Perry Lokey to have my watermelon patch.
"He was a full-growed man afore he quit snitching my melons,
"and he knowed I seen him, too.
"That old shotgun of mine,
I wants to leave
"to Mr. Len Childers.
"When he was a little boy, he shot it off at a cottontail
"and knocked it plumb over a rail fence.
"I reckon he's big enough and man enough to handle it now.
"I wants to leave my hogs and chickens to Mr. Thad Gabry.
"My, how that boy did love barbecue.
"He could smell it a mile off.
"I wants him to give a big barbecue and invite all our friends."
"Mr. Bill Cole can have my razor.
"Ever since he was knee-high to a hop toad,
"the thing he wanted more than anything else was a beard.
"Now I reckon he's got more beard than he wants.
"Every time he hones my razor,
"I hopes it'll remind him that the Lord will provide.
"My tools I leaves to Mr. Matt Gibson.
"One time helpin' me chop wood,
"he like to cut off his big toe with my ax.
"Now I reckon he's the best sawmill boss in the world."
"My old dog Belle,
I leaves to Mr. Justin Briley.
"He didn't have no dog of his own when he was a little boy.
"I wants him to let her run free and not keep her on no rope."
"I wants all the mica on my property
"to go to Mr. Lon Backett.
"Seems like he wants that mica powerful bad.
"Now he can have it.
"There's something else
I wants to leave to Mr. Backett.
"I wants him to have my Bible.
"It ain't fancy.
I guess it's almost wore out.
"But I wants Mr. Backett to have it.
I hope he reads it."
You can have him now.
There's no writin' on here.
This ain't a will.
Yes, it is, son.
It's the will of god.
* Oh, to grace how great a debtor *
* Daily I'm constrained to be *
* Let thy goodness like a fetter *
* Bind my wandering heart to thee *
* Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it *
* Prone to leave the God I love *
* Here's my heart, Lord, take and seal it *
* Seal it for thy courts above *
* Amen *
* Will there be any stars *
* Any stars in my crown *
* When at evening the sun goeth down *
* When I wake with the Blessed
*in the Mansions of Rest*
* Will there be any stars in my crown? *
* I am thinking today of that beautiful land *
* I shall reach when the sun goeth down *
* When through wonderful grace by my savior I stand *
* Will there be any stars in my crown? *
* Will there be any stars, any stars in my crown *
* When at evening the sun goeth down *
* When I wake with the blessed in the mansions of rest *
* Will there be any stars in my crown? *
Thank you, madame.
Good morning, monsieur.
- Some nice fresh...
- There it is.
- I need some onions.
- Delivered this morning.
Pick them out yourself.
- How are the peaches?
- Eh, the peaches?
Wonderful.
I ate one this morning, and I never tasted...
- Uh, can I help you?
- Merci.
- Please, monsieur, be careful with the peaches.
- Yes.
There are some wonderful plums, monsieur.
If you can't use the plums, then...
- Uh..huh.
- One kilo is enough.
- A kilo and a half, monsieur.
Put it on the scale yourself.
- One kilo.
- Monsieur, string beans?
And there's some lovely carrots fresh this morning.
- We need some butter.
There's a dairy down there.
- Monsieur, my money, please.
Pay for it.
Uh, excuse me.
I'm looking for the shop of Mr. Godet, the baker.
We just arrived in town.
Ask the woman.
- Fresh this morning.
Taste one.
Excuse me, please.
Number 26.
There, 3 doors down.
- They are sour.
- Uh, monsieur, because you're a nice gentleman...
- here, monsieur... especially because you are a nice gentleman...
Oh. Please, monsieur.
I'm looking for Mr. Godet, the baker.
Dead.
Died a month ago.
Oh.
What a pity.
You know him?
No, my father knew him.
Mm-hmm.
And Mr. Godet's wife?
Oh, she took the children and moved to Marseilles to her brother.
Tell your father that the brother's name is Pastin in Marseilles.
My...my father's dead.
Oh.
You see, my father told me that his old friend, Mr. Godet would someday help me,
So when my father was dead and there was nobody there,
I wrote him a letter, to Mr. Godet.
And I packed my things and left.
And I thought Mr. Godet would be expecting me.
Oh.
I see.
You, uh...have no family?
Where will you go?
You have any money?
Well, I thought Mr. Godet would let me work for him in his bakery, perhaps.
I'm very strong, you know?
I'm a hard worker.
I can work very hard without getting a bit tired.
Hmm.
Come in.
Come in. Come in.
Come in.
Have you eaten?
Not...not today,
Hmm.
Perhaps a little bread?
Oh.
Come on.
A little cheese, maybe, huh?
Thank you.
And, uh...a little wine.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
In here. In here.
That's it. Ha ha.
Now, perhaps you will work for me, eh?
Of course, you understand
I can't pay you while you learn, but you'll have a nice bed to sleep in and a stove to cook a little supper, and in the morning, you will open the shop and sell a few buttons and pins and, uh... be my little helper, huh?
Huh?
Hmm. I'm going in here.
Paul, will you get me a bottle of pinot in the wine shop?
[  Shopkeeper  ]
I'm not going to hurt you.
[  Lili  ]  I want to go.
- Oh, no. Come here.
- Please, I want to go.
- Please.
- Oh, no, no, no.
- I am not going to hurt you.
- I'm telling you, I want to go.
- I want to go.
- No, wait.
- Don't be afraid.
Oh. Yes, monsieur?
May I be of service, monsieur?
A little trouble with my helper.
Very difficult to find good help these days.
- They're lazy and stupid.
- And uncooperative.
- How much?
- 90 please, monsieur.
I want half a dozen.
What are you standing there for?
You can get out.
I take her off the streets, a girl with no references, no family, no money, and...colors, monsieur... and I give her place to sleep and food to eat and a fine opportunity to learn a trade.
And what happens?
Nothing, I hope.
Uh, 80.
She breaks my pitcher and eats my food.
- I didn't...
- I didn't eat anything.
- I was going to eat, but he...
You're through.
Good-bye.
What are you waiting for?
But my suitcase in there and my hat and my purse.
Your face is dirty, little mouse.
There is nothing to cry about.
You should be happy to leave this place.
It smells.
Does he owe you any wages?
- Wages?
For what?
She should pay me for the food she ate.
Ah?
My word of honor, monsieur,
I didn't eat a bite. Not a bite.
All right, all right, look...
Hup!
See?
It's right behind your ear.
No, this one.
See?
It's a trick?
Now, how did you know?
Everything is all right now, hmm?
What's your name?
Marc.
Marcus.
Marcus the magnificent.
It suits you.
- Enough!
OUT!
Mademoiselle.
Thank you, monsieur.
Farewell, mademoiselle.
Be of good cheer.
You are young.
It's a fine day.
And tomorrow will be another.
- Six handkerchiefs at 80 francs.
A good day to you, sir.
Where's Marc?
He went in there a minute.
Here's your wine.
Pay you tomorrow.
- What's that?
- She lost her job.
- No money, no family, no place to go.
- She seems to be going with you.
- Oh, no.
Where are you going?
- Uh, what, monsieur?
- Where do you live?
- Uh...uh...where do you live?
- Ha.
Where do we live?
- Everywhere.
Last week, Marseilles.
The week before, Avignon.
Next week, Aix-les-Bains.
- Huh.
You...you travel.
How pleasant.
- Who is she?
Where did you find her?
- She loves me.
- What's your name?
- Lilette Daurier.
But my father always called me Lili.
- Let me give you a word of advice, Lili.
Find someone else to love.
This Marc is dangerous.
He's got an assistant with long, red fingernails.
Ha.
Such men are dangerous.
- Hey, listen, couldn't old Pierre Corvier give her a job with the girls?
Paul, he likes you.
You could talk to him.
- Look, this is your little project.
I don't like it.
- I'm only being a good samaritan.
- I've heard it called that before.
Come on, Jacquot.
- See you later.
He...he's angry?
The lame one, I mean.
He's always angry.
Why?
Ah, he's a disagreeable man.
He's an angry man, and he always keeps to himself.
[ Scream ]
- What's the matter?
- I saw the man die!
The man is dead!
No.
They are acrobats rehearsing for the carnival.
It's nothing. Look.
There.
Oh.
See?
Come along, now.
I'll show you.
You hold this, will you?
Come on.
Come on.
[ Hammering ]
[ Music plays ]
[ Marc whistling to the music ]
[ Marc continues whistling ]
[ Dog barks ]
My chateau.
[ Closes door ]
Blow.
[ Lili gasps ]
Now, what can we do about you? Hmm?
What would you like most?
A glass of wine?
Something to eat?
I...I would like most to stay with you.
I...I can cook.
I...I could clean the house.. wash the dishes.
Please.
Kiss me.
[ Lily kisses him ]
You've never kissed a man before!
Yes, many.
That's a lie.
Yes.
How old are you, Lili?
A girl of 16 should have a little sense.
Following people in the streets.
How did you get here?
Well, I...
I..I used to live in Manasse with my father, you see?
But then a month ago my father died, so I came here to work with M. Godet, the baker, you know?
But monsieur Godet the baker was dead.
So I couldn't work with him in his bakery.
That's all.
You haven't had too good a time with life, have you?
Oh, things were nice when I lived with my father.
He...he would make me laugh.
He'd tell me jokes.
Shall I tell you a joke?
Yes.
When is a singer not a singer?
When?
When he's a little hoarse.
Good, eh?
Yeah.
He was a watchmaker, my father. You know that?
He could fix any watch.
Oh, shall I show you my father's own watch?
He let me keep it when everything was sold.
Keeps a very good time.
Only sometimes I forget to wind it.
It's gold-plated.
Yes.
Yes, it's very nice.
Now, uh, look, Lili...
Maybe I could get you a job in the carnival.
Well, what kind of job?
Well, uh...can you dance?
No.
Uh...sing?
Well, I...I can carry a tune, but...
What can you do?
I kept house for my father, you see.
I have an assistant who keeps house for me.
Now, I want you to get yourself something to eat, and I'll go and see what I can do for you with Mr. Corvier.
Oh!
Don't do that.
You mustn't throw yourself at men that way. It isn't nice.
Well, it's nice. I mean, it's nice, but you shouldn't do it.
I'll be back.
Whew.
[ Hammering sound ]
Have you seen old Corvier?
They're setting up.
Oh.
What are you going to do about that girl?
She's very young.
She'll get older.
Before her time.
The female soul is like a chestnut.
It must go through fire before it becomes delicious.
Very clever.
How's Rosalie?
I could learn to dislike him.
I already have.
She needs the job.
I could use another waitress.
Fine.
Good figure?
Just take her on for a while.
You don't have to keep her, you understand?
I understand very well.
Take her off your hands.
Fine. Thanks.
Thanks a lot.

[ Women talking ]
Ha ha ha ha.
Oh.
Monsieur Marc, I...
Hello.
I...I saw you do the trick.
Yeah?
It was...beautiful.
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.
But aren't you working?
No more.
Oh.
Well...um...here.
Have some fun at the carnival.
Oh, thank you, but Monsieur Corvier paid me.
Oh, well, that's fine, then.
- Come on. Let's eat.
In a minute.
Wh-wh-what shall I do now?
Well, uh...why don't you go back to that shop?
That was a pretty good job you had.
Job?
Yeah. That fellow wasn't so bad.
He meant well.
He was very jolly.
That's the kind of job you should have.
Oh, but I...I...I want to stay near you.
You cannot.
You don't want to make trouble for me, do you?
Oh...
I-I'd rather die.
Good girl.
Well, good luck.
[ Dogs barking ]
But, Monsieur Marc...
Must be rushing along now.
Talk to you later.
[ Women talking ]
[ Man ]  Hey, look what we have here, John.
[ Other man ]   Sorry.
You'll have to get out.
The carnival's closed for the night.
Hi. Hey, why don't you go back home?
Let's go. Let's go.
And hurry.
[ Voice ]
- Hey.
- [ Whistles ]
- Lili.
- Hey, Lili.
- [ Whistles ]
- Lili.
- Yoo-hoo.
Yes, it's me,
Carrot Top. Come over here.
- Lili.
- Come on down.
- Come on down.
- I have all sorts of things to discuss with you,
- and they can't wait.
I can't imagine what you're doing over there, but I wish you'd stop it.
It'll have to wait until later.
- This is much more important.
- Come along now.
It's nicer over here.
- Much nicer.
And I'm a very interesting fellow.
- Don't forget your purse.
- Pick it up, Lili dear.
- [ Humming ]
- La la la la la la la la
- Leave the suitcase.
You can get it later.
Now hurry. Walk over here.
- Right foot. Left foot.
- Faster, please.
I'm frightfully impatient.
Come along now.
Well, come on. Come on.
Closer.
Well, now then.
How ya been, Lili?
Lose your job over at the cabaret?
Forget it.
Let me see your locket.
Ah, it's a watch.
Does it run?
Well, let me hear.
Mmm, my.
Very fine.
Grr!
- Do I frighten ya?
Grr!
- Oh, be quiet.
You don't frighten anybody.
Well, I try.
You must admit I try.
Shake hands with Lili.
I call her...Lili dear.
Golo the Giant.
Oh, my. I'm always so brave until they get close to me.
Girls frighten him.
It's because I like them so.
Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho.
He'll be all right when he gets to know you better.
Well, hello, baby.
Go away, Reynardo.
I saw her first.
Be careful.
He'll steal your watch.
Go away.
Not a chance.
Let's ignore him.
Maybe he'll go away.
[ Humming ]
He's jealous of me because I'm cleverer than he is, and ever so much more handsome, don't you think?
No, she don't.
I think my eyes are my best feature.
Come a little closer and look into them.
Ahh.
I'll tell Marguerite.
Tell me, do you like champagne, hmm?
Wait till Marguerite sees this.
- Marguerite.
May I have the next waltz?
Reynardo, behave yourself.
Uh-oh.
Don't listen to him, my dear. He is a seducer.
With a heart like a kitten.
Ho!
I don't know why nobody trusts me.
I know why.
Well, keep it to yourself, you old hag.
WHAT did you say?
- Uh...what did you hear?
- Reynardo, I must insist that you address me
- more respectfully.
Introduce us.
Introduce us?
Introduce us?
She has to be introduced to a girl, but, believe me, when it's a man, she...
Reynardo, introduce us.
Lili, Marguerite.
How do you do, Lili?
How do you do?
He's a dreadful wolf.
I thought he was a fox.
Ha! That's the worst kind of wolf.
And as for you,
I know your kind.
So innocent.
Ha ha. Oh, yes, so innocent.
But making goo-goo eyes at Reynardo. Really!
- Oh, my. What'd you do to Marguerite?
What'd you say to her?
She's disturbed.
I...I didn't say anything.
Well, you'd better make it up.
Be nice to her.
How?
Hmm. Well, let's see, now...
I've got it.
Flatter her.
What?
Flatter her.
Say she's pretty.
Oh, Marguerite's very pretty.
Louder.
I'll do it.
Marguerite is very pretty.
She has a face like a mountain goat.
- [ Gasps ]
- And she's witty.
- She has the brains of an angleworm.
[ Marguerite ]
- I heard that, Reynardo.
Uh-oh.
I heard what you said, Reynardo.
You're a wicked, insulting no-good, and I'll have nothing more to do with you.
She's very upset now.
Be nice to her.
Ask her to dance for us.
Uh...uh...will you dance for us, Marguerite?
What?
Ah. Ah. Ha ha ha.
Well, thank you.
- I don't have my ballet slippers, but I'll try.
- Sing something, my dear.
- Anything, you know?
Oh, well, I...
Any old thing.
Oh. I remember hi-Lili, hi-lo.
Sweet?
It's just an old song, but..
I used to sing it with my father.
It'll do.
'On every tree, there sits a bird.'
[ Accordian starts to play ]
Come on.
You know it.
Come on.
Let's hear it.
On every tree there sits a bird singing a song of love.
On every tree there sits a bird,
and every one I ever heard could break my heart without a word.
Singing a song of love
Ahem.
A song of love is a sad song. hi-Lili, hi-Lili, hi-lo.
A song of love is a song of woe.
Don't ask me how I know.
A song of love is a sad song,
for I have loved, and it's so.
hi-Lili, hi-Lili, hi-lo, hi-lo hi-Lili, hi-Lili, hi-lo.
hi-Lili, hi-Lili, hi-lo, hi-lo hi-Lili, hi-Lili........ hi-lo.
[ Audience joins in ]
A song of love is a sad song, hi-Lili, hi-Lili, hi-lo.
A song of love is a song of woe.
Don't ask me how I know.
A song of love is a sad song, for I have loved, and it's so.
hi-Lili, hi-Lili, hi-lo, hi-lo hi-Lili, hi-Lili, hi-lo.
hi-Lili, hi-Lili, hi-lo, hi-lo hi-Lili, hi-Lili, hi-lo.
[ Applause and music continues playing hi-Lili, hi-lo ]
[ Accordian music is heard ]
Here he is now, the boss.
But that's the angry man.
Ha. He's all right.
Now, then, has Jacquot told you?
No, I just fed her.
We're gonna take you on.
We're gonna change the act and play it for adults.
It'll be a job, fairly steady work.
You'll be paid your share.
Thank you...very much.
What's the matter?
Well...I...I don't know if... what...what could I do?
Exactly what you did tonight.
You'll go walking by, wearing that dress... mm-hmm.
Hair just as it is... the puppets will stop you and speak to you... mm-hmm.
After that, you'll talk about anything.
You'll just answer whatever the puppets happen to say...
The way you did tonight.
- Keep the hi-Lili song in.
I intend to.
We'll agree each night before we start on the general content of the show.
You'll have to learn to raise your voice a bit, and turn to the audience occasionally...
Monsieur Marc,
- Monsieur Marc, hee hee.
I'm staying on.
- [ Giggle ]
The angry man gave me a job.
Isn't that wonderful?
Well, that's great.
- That's fine for everybody, yeah?
Mm-hmm.
Well, you are all set, then.
Be seeing you.
It isn't gonna work.
Sure it is.
It's a great idea.
The little fool isn't interested... in us or the act.
Oh, but I am.
I love Carrot Top and Reynardo.
We know whom you love.
- Come on.
It's gonna be all right.
- Don't worry.
Find her a place to sleep.
- But, but, he..he's angry, he said that...
- Don't worry.
Everything will be all right.
Why is Mr. Berthalet so strange?
Because... because his name is not Berthalet.
Because he used to be Paul Berthold, the great dancer.
Because his leg was injured in the war.
Because now he cannot dance and has to be a puppeteer, and doesn't always like it.
But you must never, never speak to him about it.
Come on now.
Here we are.
There's a little room back here you can use.
Will he let me stay?
You'll stay.
The truth is, he's very excited about the idea of having a new kind of show.
You'll work well with him.
Oh, but I didn't know I was working.
Well, you...you're giving me your room.
There's another place back there for me.
Now go to bed, sleep well, and dream of magicians, beautiful magicians.
[ Rhythmic clapping ]
[Clap ]
[ Door closes ]
- [ Jacquot ]  Stop slamming doors.
Be quiet. The girl's asleep.
- [ Paul ]  Do you think I'm drunk?
- [ Jacquot ]  I know you're drunk.
- Let's open a bottle.
- You've had enough.
What makes you think so?
- Go to bed.
Tomorrow is another day.
Oh, now there's a profound statement.
That's a gem...
"Tomorrow is another day."
And tomorrow... and tomorrow and tomorrow with the audience.
That audience, those endless little faces alike as mothballs.
I hate 'em!
You don't hate them.
My head aches.
That's not my fault.
I've had too much to drink.
I'll get you some coffee.
Now...why is it that when a man goes to great effort and expense to get drunk, his friends, instead of respecting this endeavor, do everything they can to sober him up?
Why?
Why?
Because they mean well.
Because they're nice people?
I love all people.
You said you hated them.
Well, it wasn't true.
I love them... the helpless people who live on the earth, draw their comfort from it.
Sometimes from each other.
- What have we here?
A girl in love.
Try this.
It's a good thing to be in love I'm told.
I'm told it's a matter... not of what you love, but of how you love... and that a little of what you really want is better than large quantities of what you don't.
As for me, I want all.
Refusal to compromise.
A sign of immaturity, you know?
Wait! Wait.
Ladies and gentlemen...
I shall now perform a double pirouette.
- Paul...
[ Thud ]
[ Bangs wall ]
How do you do?
I'm paul Berthalet... half man... half mountebank... disenchanted, dispossessed, but going on like a dog chasing a stick... a lame dog... trying to run like the others, but not getting there.
Oh, well, anyway.
I...I'm sure you're wrong.
I'm sure Reynardo never steals.
Never steals? Hah!
Well, you know my diamond comb, the one I always wear?
But, I had it on the dresser the other day. I was going to put it on.
I reached for it, and out of the corner of my eye,
I looked up and suddenly...
Oh! There, you see?
Well, Reynardo, shame on you.
Ahem.
Oh, is this yours?
Yes.
Ahem. Sorry.
Oh, well, you know, he didn't know it was, it was mine.
[ Audience laughs ]
And then, along came the biggest one of all.
What!
I don't believe it.
Well, it's true.
I don't believe it.
Well...huh,... come on now, don't you do that. Ho, ho, ho.
[ Audience laughs ]
That's for you.
- It's getting to be so much.
- That's the way the boss wants it.
Go, buy yourself something you don't need.
Thank you.
Thank you, Pierre!
Stop making a fool of yourself.
For the first time you have money, and what do you do?
Stuff yourself with candy and buy fairway dolls.
Can't you think of anything better to buy?
Is there nothing you want?
With the whole world to choose from, isn't there anything you want?
- But if you could have anything you wanted...anything, with the whole world to choose from, what would you ask for?
If you could have anything...an-y-thing... what would it be?
- Well...I...I don't know.
- I know.
Ice cream!  Ice cream!
- No, no, no.
Pretty curls, like mine.
- What everybody wants... to be able to steal anything without being caught.
-Oh!
A pretty blue dress like mine.
- Wait a minute.
Let her talk. Let Lili talk.
- Well, I...I don't know.
- I know...
I know what you want.
I think you'd like, someday, to have the feeling that you're loved... that somebody cares what happens to you.
- Aww, I care.
- I care.
- I care.
- I care.
- I care.
- [ Child ]  I care.
- [ Woman ]   I care.
- And I care.
Hey... hmm?
Well...a new dress.
New shoes.
Very pretty.
Very chic.
Very grown up.
Look at her, Paul.
Isn't she pretty?
Well, say something, you...
...boss.
I don't care what you wear on the street, but get back into your gray dress for the show.
Oh, yes, of course.
I...I...
Lili, go wait for us a minute.
We'll have lunch in the tent.
So, the awkward child is becoming an attractive dish, and you don't like it, because from now on, there's gonna be competition.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I think you do.
[ Carousel plays hi-Lili, hi-lo ]
You talk too much, Jacquot.
At times.
What the devil is the matter with you?
You're in love with the girl, and she's in love with someone else.
This sort of thing happens all the time.
People don't die of love.
You'll recover... but meanwhile, can't you be civilized about it?
I'll try.
Come on.
Let's go to lunch.
Hi, Lili!
- Hi, Claude!
- You hear this?
We are famous.
- The whole town's singing it.
- Monsieur Corvier said last night the orchestra at Hotel Dubois played it.
The people from the hotel are coming to the carnival to see our show, to see our little leading lady... who has a new dress.
Oh, yes. Very nice.
Where did you buy it?
"Last performance tonight"?
What happened?
- Hello!
Rosalie, what's that mean?
Marc had an offer from the cabaret of the hotel.
The Hotel Dubois?!
Oh, Jacquot, no more carnivals.
No more living in trailers.
From now on, it's hotels and cabarets.
Cote D'azur, Cannes, Nice, perhaps even Paris!
The Folies Paris!
Congratulations!
Are you going with Marc?
And why not?
I...just wondered.
You're crazy about
Marc, aren't you?
You and a hundred others.
Me, too.
Lili dear looks sad tonight. Why?
Her lover's going away.
-Her lover's going away.
- I have no lover!
Why, you foolish child.
Every girl should have several.
He wouldn't be leaving if you knew how to hold a man.
But he isn't leaving me.
- [Reynardo ]
Naturally.
No one could leave my lovely Lili.
He's staying.
No. He-he's going, but he isn't leaving me.
- [Golo ]  Oh?
You're going with him?
No.
Why not?
Because he didn't ask her.
Well, an experienced woman knows how to make the man ask her.
Ask her what?
- [ Reynardo ]
That depends.
Now, what do you want him to ask you?
I didn't say
I wanted him to...
You see,
-  he isn't my...
- Oh, really!
She doesn't make sense.
How can I when you...
- [Carrot Top ]
Now you're making her cry.
Poor girl.
She's been throwing herself at the man, and he doesn't know she's alive.
But he does.
He's been very kind to me.
He's the only one who ever was... except you, but now even you...
Please, let's talk about something else.
- [Carrot Top ]
I know.
We'll sing for you.
Ahem.
A song of love is a gay song, hi-Lili, hi-Lili, hi-lo.
A song of love is a song of joy,
A waltz for girl and boy.
[ Golo ]  A song of love is a gay song, for we're in love, and it's so.
hi-Lili, hi-Lili, hi-lo, hi-lo, hi-Lili, hi-Lili, hi-lo.
hi-Lili, hi-Lili, hi-lo, hi-lo, hi-Lili, hi-Liliiiii...hi-lo.
[ Applause ] Well!
Oh, thank you.
Thank you so much.
- [ Rosalie ]  It's going to be very different now.
It wasn't so bad all these years when you were mad about women who didn't count.
And anyhow, we were always on the move, and I knew you had to leave them sooner or later.
But now, there's going to be rich Americans on the prowl, and smart divorcees.
And that's a different matter.
You'll be a good catch with money in your pocket, a great success.
Well, I want these women to know that you're married to me.
I'm tired of pretending to be déclassé, when I am not.
- You know it's better for the act to... that's nonsense.
You are well enough established now, and the act is good enough to stand on its own.
You don't have to dangle yourself in front of these women.
From now on, I am telling everybody that we are married.
Look, I am wearing it, and
I'm going to go on wearing it... my nice, big, fat golden band.
And you will wear yours.
It has been a secret long enough.
You thought I didn't know where it was.
Here!
Wear it.
And it wouldn't hurt you to help me with the trailer.
- Oh.
- We are leaving in a half an hour, and you are not yet packed.
- Every time we move you disappear and leave it all to me.
- Well, things are going to change.
- And, Marc, at the hotel...
[Both speaking ]
Would you please watch yourself on the curtain calls?
You don't have to take your bows at the center of the stage.
You could move over a little.
You could move over a little.
Hello...Marc.
Well...hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Wh-what are you doing?
Nothing.
How are you?
Very well, thank you.
And you?
Uh...I'm very well, too.
That's good.
Uh-huh.
Uh...would you like a cup of coffee?
Are you inviting me in?
Yes.
Sit down.
Thank you.
When are you leaving the carnival?
Very soon.
In about an hour.
Rosalie, too?
Uh-huh.
Rosalie's my partner.
Will you come and see me at the hotel?
May I?
I'd be glad if you do.
It's not very far.
Just at the edge of town.
But... will your boyfriend let you?
My who?
Your bad-tempered boyfriend.
Oh, he's not my boyfriend.
He hates me.
Carrot Top's my boyfriend.
I thought I was the one...
Oh...you are...
Ah.
I...I never see you.
You're seeing me now.
[ Door opens ]
Hello, Paul.
I dropped in to see if you'd like to buy my trailer.
I won't be needing it anymore.
You are a bit crowded in here, aren't you?
My trailer is bigger.
How do you manage, the three of you in this place?
We manage very nicely, thank you.
I'm sure you do.
Well, I'll be getting on.
Think about the trailer.
You can afford it now.
I hear you're doing very well.
The audiences like Lili.
Can't say I blame them.
Well, come and visit me sometime.
You know what you are, don't you?
But you're an amateur, an understudy, a poor man's version.
But don't be discouraged.
You'll get there because you're so willing, and it's the willingness that counts, isn't it, in all noble endeavors?
You're starting young, but you'll be interesting to observe by the time you're 20.
Let's just hope I don't have to see it!
What do you know about it?
What could you know about love?
Go on, tell me about it.
Nothing makes me sick.
[ Door slams shut ]
Marc! Marc!
Don't be a fool.
Marc!
Stop it!
[ Slap ]
Monsieur Berthalet?
Yes?
Permit me to introduce myself.
Antoine Tonit.
How do you do?
My associate, Monsieur Erique.
How do you do, monsieur?
May we sit down?
Haven't we met before?
I think not.
Berthalet...
Paul Berthalet...
Of course.
The name is different, but...
Ah.
Paul Berthold, the dancer.
Not anymore.
Yes, of course.
Just before the war.
Your first recital was a sensation.
Then you disappeared.
I went into the army.
But afterward?
Afterward, I preferred the fresh air of carnivals.
I preferred the dear faces of little children with runny noses.
Hmm.
You've hit on a great idea,
No, thank you. combining the live figure with the puppets.
Where did you find the girl?
We can't make up our minds, whether she's a superb actress or you're a svengali.
Neither.
No...she's like a little bell that gives off a pure sound no matter how you strike it, because she is in herself so good and true and pure.
She lives each show, loves it.
Those moments with the puppets are her happiest, I'll venture to say.
- I'll venture to agree.
We've...we've worked out a basic formula...
- [ Jacquot ]
Paul.
- and within that framework, we try and develop
- a new show every day...
- Paul, could you come back
- with me to the tent, please?
Uh...My associate, Jacquot.
Monsieur...
- Tonit.
- I'm sorry, I..
- We like your act.
Thank you.
If you can hold these carnival audiences, you can hold any.
The Folies de Paris will be easy.
Sure. We'll try it tomorrow.
Well, not tomorrow, perhaps, but we'd like you to be ready to open in about two weeks.
Two weeks?
Tonit?
You're Antoine Tonit of the Folies Paris!
I'm sorry.
I thought I'd told you.
- Tonit and Erique.
- As for the details of the contract, if you'll come back to the hotel with us now... fine.
We'll have to let you know.
We can't accept now.
But you have no contract here.
You're free.
Completely.
We'll have to let you know.
But we know now.
I'm sorry.
We have to talk about this.
By all means...
What do we have to talk over?
But don't dismiss this offer too lightly.
The act is nothing without the girl.
I agree.
She's enchanting.
But this one, the creativeness is his.
He has a talent for improvisation that I've never seen before.
It's close to genius.
You've hit on a new career, Berthalet, that'll outstrip anything you could've done as a dancer.
But you must know this, or you wouldn't have given up your dancing for it.
I didn't give up anything.
I became a puppeteer because it was the only way
I could earn enough to feed myself.
You see, a dancer grows conscious of his body.
When it'll no longer do what he wants it to do, he grows to hate it.
So I hid mine behind the curtain of a puppet stage.
I'm sorry.
We didn't know.
We've been tactless, I'm afraid.
No. You've done the greatest thing for me you could've done.
Tell me again what you said.
You mean that I think you've chosen a new career that'll outstrip anything you might've done as a dancer?
But you said that before you knew I was lame.
You meant it?
I meant it and more.
I'll underwrite your new career.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Tomorrow.
What was that nonsense about letting them know?
You think to get more money out of them by saying we're unwilling?
I said it because I'm not sure you have an act to sell.
Lili is leaving.
What did you do to her?
Stopped her from making a fool of herself.
Leaving?
That child's an idiot.
She's not an idiot.
And she isn't a child any longer.
She's beginning to realize the fact that there's cruelty in the world... and she's starting to protect herself from it.
Well...what do we do now?
You'll figure it out.
You're the genius.
[ Knock knock ]
[ Marc ]  Come in.
Well.
It's all right if Rosie is coming.
What I have to say won't take very long.
Here's something you lost in the trailer.
Oh.
I didn't know at first.
And I wanted to ask you, but now I think I know.
You're married to Rosalie.
I never denied it.
- No, you didn't.
- Ah.
And I've been silly.
But I've put a lot of things together in my head this last half hour.
A great many things, back to the day we met.
I know I've been living in a dream, just like a little girl... without seeing what I didn't want to see... but you want to know something, Marc?
We sometimes outgrow feelings and ideas, just like a little girl outgrows her dresses, but somehow, it turns out that there's a right time for everything... in the right order.
There's a time for going to school.
A time for losing our parents, and a time for falling in love with a beautiful magician.
But there's a time for waking up.
You are a wise girl...Lili.
Where did you learn all this?
We don't learn.
We just get older... and we know.
Good-bye, Marc.
Good-bye.
Thank you for your patience.
Forgive me for having been such a nuisance.
Oh, Rosalie,
I'm...I'm leaving.
I just said good-bye to your husband.
Good-bye.
Lili?
Oh, Lili, please, wait a minute.
Are you gonna leave without saying good-bye?
Please, Lili, just for a minute, come here.
Please? Closer.
I have a favor to ask, and
I don't want the others to hear.
If you're leaving, Lili, please take me with you.
I wanna go with you, wherever you go.
It won't be the same here without you.
You're my sweetheart, you see?
It was love at first sight.
From the first moment I saw you walking by, wearing that... awful hat, and carrying that lopsided suitcase.
- Please...oh, please don't leave us, Lili!
I never had a real friend until you came along.
Please take me with you.
If you really loved us, you wouldn't go away.
Oh, but I do.
It's just that I...
I'll say it.
You hate the boss.
He's unreasonable.
He's mean.
He's jealous.
We'll protect you from him.
Oh, you always have.
You've always been so kind and good...
- and you seem to know what's in my heart or
- what I'm thinking and what I'm feeling.
I'll kill him!
I'm gonna kill the boss! Grrr!
Well, anyway, I'll give him a good talking to.
Hey, boss...
- Lili?
Here.
It's our going-away present.
Oh, Reynardo...how very nice.
It was very expensive.
He probably stole it.
You know Reynardo.
How did you get it, Reynardo?
Well, must I tell?
Reynardo, you promised me you would never steal again.
I didn't steal it.
If you must know, I'm paying for it on the installment plan.
What happens if you don't keep up with the payments?
I know him.
He'll never keep up.
They'll come and take it away from you.
No, they won't.
I made a deal.
What sort of a deal?
Well, I agreed that if I didn't keep up with the payments,
I'd give the man something else in exchange.
I signed a paper.
Uh-oh.
He signed a paper.
What does the man get in exchange?
Another fox fur.
Another?
Uh-huh... me.
Well, you poor darling.
- You traded your life
- to get me a present.
- Mmm.
Oh, Reynardo, you...
Trust him to take advantage of a situation like this.
I wanna go with you, Lili.
Why don't you take us all with you?
We don't want you to forget us, Lili.
I never could forget you.
You've become so very dear to me.
You're the only things I love.
I know you love me, too.
Why, you poor darlings, you're trembling.
Well, are you staying or going?
We've had an offer from the Folies Paris, but we can't accept it without you.
I've been an idiot, a stupid fool.
Melting and sniveling over
Reynardo and Carrot Top.
I must be crazy.
They've become so very dear to me,
I forget...I forget every time that it's only you.
Or is it you?
Is it?
Wh-what are you?
Are you just a monster without any feeling?
Why can't you ever say a kind word?
Why do you hide behind those puppets?
I am the puppets!
I'm Carrot Top: Confident, clever, capable of running his life and yours and everybody else's.
And I'm Golo the Giant:
Cowardly, stupid, longing to be loved, clumsy, and in need of comforting.
And I'm Marguerite, too:
Vain, jealous, obsessed with self, looking at my face in the mirror.
Are my teeth nice?
Is my hair growing thin?
And I'm Reynardo the thief, the opportunist, full of compromise and lies.
Like any other man, I have in me all these things, all of these and as many more again.
Must I make a new puppet for the small part of me you've managed to see?
The monster?
The angry man?
The frustrated dancer, clumping along with a leg anchored to the ground, and a heart anchored to... but you don't have to understand me or even like me.
This is business.
Not anymore.
My name is William Pittenger.
I never intended to write this book,
but after our raid into Georgia was over,
something happened
to make me change my mind.
Along with a group of men
who had shared so much with me,
I was summoned to
the War Department in Washington.
We expected nothing more
than routine questioning,
but were surprised to be invited
into Secretary Stanton"s office,
and dumbfounded as we took in
the meaning of his words.
It is a tribute to your vaIor that the boIdest expIoit of this war bringing consternation upon the
Confederacy and gIory to our Union arms, was Ied by a civiIian, and carried out by private soIdiers.
VoIunteers, to a man.
You"ve won for us a new respect, and we are gratefuI.
Congress has, by recent Iaw, prepared a medaI to be awarded for conspicuous bravery:
""The CongressionaI MedaI of Honor.""
You gentIemen are to have the first ever given.
CorporaI WiIIiam Pittenger.
CongratuIations, Mr. Pittenger.
[ Pittenger] I tried to thank him
but I felt too unworthy,
remembering our missing comrades
and our brave leader Andrews
who had gained us this honor.
[Pittenger] James J. Andrews was a man
of mystery, as befitted his vocation.
Though in reality a Union spy,
he was trusted throughout the South
as a blockade runner.
It was typical that even now
as he neared our lines,
he was riding a horse he had borrowed
from the Confederates.
On that eventful day in 1862,
I was in charge of a picket detail,
guarding the approach to our
headquarters camp, south of Nashville.
Pittenger, why don"t you hire a substitute, so the war won"t interfere with your reading?
This concerns the war.
Bringing out a new medaI.
""The CongressionaI MedaI of Honor.""
This ain"t for you and me.
That"s for generaIs.
Not our generaIs.
They won"t even Iet us fight.
MitcheII wouId, if they"d give him a chance.
Maybe.
AII I know is I joined this army to kiII Johnny Rebs, and so far, I ain"t even seen one.
You"ve been Iucky.
It"s aII right, BiII.
I know him.
GIad to see you, Mr. Andrews.
What"s your regiment doing this far south of NashviIIe?
GeneraI BueII moved out with most of the army to reinforce Grant.
There"s a big fight shaping up around Corinth.
I probabIy don"t have to teII you.
I didn"t know BueII was gone.
Who"s in command here now?
GeneraI MitcheII. He"s madder than a wet hen to be Ieft behind.
So were we.
- Why are you Ieft behind?
- To guard NashviIIe.
It"s nice to taIk with you again, CorporaI.
Mr. Andrews... if you ever want heIp on a Secret Service mission, don"t forget the name Pittenger.
WiIIiam Pittenger.
In aII of East Tennessee, there"s no concentration of Confederate forces worth the mention.
The Southern army at KnoxviIIe is bareIy abIe to defend the city
- from Union GeneraI Morgan.
- What about Chattanooga?
BueII was certain a great army was gathering there.
GeneraI MitcheII, there are onIy
2,000 raw recruits in Chattanooga, and another 2,000 that aren"t even armed!
Here we wait with 1 0,000 choice troops under strict orders to guard NashviIIe.
If onIy I"d been given some Iatitude,
I"d march right into Chattanooga.
- WouIdn"t that be defending NashviIIe?
- Yes, by George!
As Iong as I keep the enemy in front of me, NashviIIe wiII be fuIIy protected.
But I don"t want Chattanooga unIess I can hoId it.
It might be two weeks before BueII couId reinforce me.
Have you any idea how many men the Confederates couId bring out of AtIanta against me?
1 5,000 at Ieast.
That many?
Suppose we have a Iook, Andrews, and see how matters stand.
Here"s Lee, who has his hands fuII in Virginia.
And here"s Beauregard, who"s bringing up everything he"s got to fight Grant at ShiIoh.
And here"s their east-west raiIroad, aII the way from AIexandria to Memphis, with Chattanooga right in the strategic center.
Here we are. So, if I moved down here to HuntsviIIe, captured the Iocomotives and fIat cars, and rode into Chattanooga, aII I"d have to fear wouId be these forces out of AtIanta.
That"s true, sir, but we"re right back where we started from.
They can move their soIdiers up the raiIroad from AtIanta and drive you out of Chattanooga in two days.
There are 1 1 raiIroad bridges over the Chicamagua.
A man Iike you couId Iead a raiding party and burn those bridges for me.
Why not?
I had a deaI with GeneraI BueII that when I brought this information,
I wouIdn"t go South anymore.
Soon as I compIete this report,
I aim to enIist in the 21 st Ohio.
You"d Ieave the Secret Service to become a foot soIdier?
Yes, sir. Maybe I won"t be any great shakes in the infantry, but at Ieast it wouIdn"t be hiding under a cIoak.
After just so Iong, a man has to come out in the open.
Mr. Andrews, I wouIdn"t detaiI any man on a duty of this kind against his wiII.
But consider what it might mean to the Union.
Cut the Confederacy in two.
We couId shorten the war by haIf, maybe end it.
[Pittenger] I"d heard from Mr. Andrews
sooner than I expected.
[Pittenger] I"d heard from Mr. Andrews
sooner than I expected.
That night a score of adventurous men,
most from the 2 1st and 33rd Ohio Infantry,
followed me to a meeting place
on a hillside.
[coyote howIs]
- Good evening, gentIemen.
- [aII] Good evening.
AII here, Mr. Andrews.
Which are Brown and Knight?
Private WiIson Brown, Company F.
Private WiIIiam Knight, Company E.
Not any Ionger, gentIemen.
Forget that you"ve ever been soIdiers.
Mr. Brown and Mr. Knight have been informed by their company commanders about our venture.
They know what they have to do.
We can"t get aIong without them.
AII I can teII the rest of you is that whiIe
MitcheII moves toward Chattanooga, we must penetrate more than 1 00 miIes behind the Confederate Iines in Georgia to destroy the raiIroad.
If we faiI, every one of us may be hanged or torn in pieces by an angry mob.
You have no experience pIaying the part of spies.
Some of you are pretty young.
Since we"re asking you to voIunteer bIindIy, it won"t be dishonorabIe to back out now.
If you had any sense, you"d return to camp and get into uniform again.
[coyote howIs]
Good. You"re the men for me.
Now then, you"re to traveI southeast through the CumberIand Mountains, cross the Tennessee River, and be ready to catch the 5:00 train south out of Chattanooga Thursday afternoon.
Your destination is the RaiIroad HoteI at Marietta, Georgia.
If anyone faiIs to meet me there before sun up Friday morning, the attempt wiII be made without him.
Any questions?
I"m BiII CampbeII.
What"II we teII the Johnny Rebs about who we are and where we"re from?
TeII them you"re Kentuckians, escaping
Yankee ruIe to join a Southern regiment.
If they press you, teII them you haiI from FIeming County, Kentucky.
I"m from FIemingsburg, and no man from that county ever joined the Southern army.
- What if they have us cornered?
- Don"t hesitate to join their army.
You can escape back to your own Iines some dark night on picket duty.
I"m Bob Buffum. WouId you care to teII us how you intend to reach Marietta?
I"II traveI on the same road, sometimes before you, sometimes behind.
- We aIIowed to taIk to you?
- Treat me as you wouId a stranger.
As for you, Mr. Buffum, it might be wiser if you didn"t speak at aII.
I never met a Kentuckian so pIainIy from Massachusetts.
[thunder]
Do you have your pistoIs?
Keep them hidden.
In this business, you never fight unIess you"ve faiIed, and we won"t faiI.
Nothing can stop us.
[thunder]
Nothing.
[Pittenger] Andrews gave us 3 days for
ourjourney through the Cumberlands.
Traveling by twos and threes,
we were strung out miles apart
in a desolate country.
We"d been supplied with Confederate
money, but food and lodging were scarce,
and transportation out of the question.
My companion was the Giant,
Bill Campbell.
As I came to know him, I felt a growing
concern over his quick, violent temper.
One such powder keg could blow
our whole expedition sky-high.
We reached the Tennessee River on time,
only to find it impassable.
Pardon me, ma"am. Do you know the whereabouts of the ferryman?
Home, Iike enough. But he won"t chance it across before morning.
River"s swoIe up mighty angry.
- CouId you put us up for the night?
- Where you from?
[Pittenger] FIemingsburg, Kentucky.
Inn"s pretty fuII.
We can pay doubIe.
[thunder]
They"re from FIemingsburg, too.
There"s a score of us in aII.
We couIdn"t abide the Yankees anymore so we puIIed up stakes.
Gonna throw in our Iot with the Southern army.
Come in, aII of ya.
It won"t cost you a cent.
FIemingsburg? I can"t rightIy say
I"ve ever been to FIemingsburg.
UnIess you wanna be under the thumb of the aboIitionists, you better not go now.
I never thought Kentucky wouId be run by cIay-eaters and poor white trash!
There"s some mighty fine foIks in Kentucky.
Yes, and more of them are coming south every day.
Isn"t that just giving up your state to the Yankees?
They"ve got it aIready.
They"re so strong in the IegisIature, they passed a Iaw that any man fighting for the South forfeits his state"s rights
- to citizenship, Iand and hoIdings.
- Has it come to that?
Yes, sir. I know that to be true.
The governor of Kentucky has four sons.
Two are fighting for the Yankees, and two are in my regiment.
They toId me that unIess we won, they couId never go home again.
Damn Yankees!
Jess, you"re at tabIe.
Quit your swearing.
""Damn Yankee"" ain"t swearing, Mother, and you know it.
Jem, maybe the brave Kentuckians wouId Iike to join your regiment.
I"d be mighty proud to have them, if you can wait tiII this comes off.
I"d take you to Chattanooga with me, introduce you to GeneraI Ledbetter.
We"re honored, but we had our hearts set on enIisting in the 1 st Georgia regiment.
Some of our friends have aIready joined it, and we"re anxious to push on.
1 st Georgia!
Did you hear that, Mother?
No river"s gonna hoId you back.
That ferryman doesn"t Iike fIood water, but he"II take you over first thing in the morning or find himseIf out of a job.
[Innkeeper] I knew it. I knew Jess McIntyre wouId heIp you.
- They"re heIping us, ain"t they?
- Yes, sir!
- Retha, give them boys more chicken.
- Yes, ma"am.
You"re aII very kind, kinder than we deserve.
That"s right.
[Innkeeper] You won"t have no troubIe at aII. Once foIks find out what you"re up to, they"II put the big pot in the IittIe one.
[Innkeeper] WeII, Iook who"s here!
[Retha] Land sakes, but you"re wet!
You need some of Retha"s cooking,
Mr. Andrews.
Sounds mighty good.
SmeIIs even better.
I think I"II get warm first.
Evening.
[Innkeeper] Retha, fetch Mr. Andrews that peach brandy, you hear?
Yes, ma"am.
Ladies and gentIemen, I have great news.
On the strength of it, I"d ask you aII to have a gIass with me... if I knew the coIor of your poIitics.
You needn"t worry about these boys.
They"ve been Iiving amongst Yankees, but they"re coming out on the right side.
Good.
We won a great victory at ShiIoh.
- Did Beauregard Iick that buzzard Grant?
- [Andrews] Cut him to ribbons.
What about the Yankee gunboats at Pittsburgh Landing?
1 00 of them sunk, and thousands of prisoners taken.
The whoIe Yankee force, gone up the spout.
[cheers]
Isn"t that wonderfuI?
Ladies and gentIemen...
I give you a toast.
The Confederacy.
You don"t seem very happy over our victory, Mr. CampbeII.
He"s not. He wants to kiII aII the Yankees himseIf.
[Iaughter]
- Sounds Iike a Kentuckian.
- We"re aII from Kentucky.
You"II find pIenty of action Iater on, sir.
But before you go any further South, there"s one thing we must teach you.
What"s that?
Dixie.
- Sing it.
- May I?
[Innkeeper] Go right ahead.
Come on, boys, gather "round.
? Oh, I wish I was in the land of cotton
Old times there are not forgotten ?
? Look away, look away
Look away, Dixie Land ?
? In Dixie Land where I was born
In early on one frosty morn ?
? Look away, look away
Look away, Dixie Land ?
? Then I wish I was in Dixie
Away, away ?
? In Dixie Land I"ll take my stand
To live and die in Dixie ?
? Away, away
Away down south in Dixie ?
? Away, away
Away down south in Dixie ?
? Away, away... ?
?Away down south in Dixie ?
Mr. CampbeII, do you have something on your mind?
I wanna know just one thing.
Do we have to be better Southerners than the Johnny Rebs themseIves?
I went pretty far tonight.
But Iet me teII you this:
If you can"t drink their toasts and sing their songs,
Iove Jeff Davis and hate Abe LincoIn untiI next Friday, you"II never reach Marietta.
I"m sorry.
Then you were exaggerating about ShiIoh?
Yes.
When I bring them good news, I"m doubIy weIcome. The truth is bad enough.
Bad enough to stop
GeneraI MitcheII"s advance?
No. ShiIoh can"t stop him, but the deviIish rains may.
The troubIe is, our movements and his have to dovetaiI.
[Andrews] He has an army and cannon to move.
It"s taking a chance, but we"II have to postpone our pIans for one day.
I"II wait here for the rest of the men.
You go into Chattanooga, and if you see any of the boys who didn"t come this way, pass the word aIong.
[snoring]
What"d you do before the war?
Taught schooI a whiIe.
How do you Iike this business?
There"s one side of it I can"t get used to.
Mr. McIntyre... and the widow woman who fed us and gave us her bed...
When I deceive "em, I feeI Iike the Iowest snake that crawIs.
I know.
That soIdier, he"s supposed to be my enemy.
I"m supposed to hate him the way CampbeII does.
But I don"t think I can.
It"s worse when a Southerner"s your best friend.
Like oId Jim Lindsay.
Even picked out the girI I"m going to marry,
"cause she"s Yankee-minded Iike me.
Now that I"ve turned spy and have to fooI him,
I can hardIy Iook him in the eye anymore.
How do you stand it?
I beIieve in a federaI union.
So do I.
I hope we can preserve it without any more ShiIohs.
They say the sIaughter was so fierce on both sides, you couId waIk across the fieId on dead bodies Iike stepping stones.
How wouId you Iike to put a stop to that, Pittenger?
CouId we, with what we"re doing?
Maybe we can.
[Pittenger] We managed to be on the
Friday train, headed south.
So far, we were lucky.
[standing soIdier] ? A rebel I will be
A rebel till I die ?
? I would not give a fig
To live under a Yankee sky ?
? We are sons of holy Dinah
And we go where we"ve a mind to ?
? And we stay where we"re inclined to
As long as we have fun ?
? Oh, we licked the Yanks at Shiloh
Oh-my, oh-my, oh-my-oh ?
? Yes, we licked the Yanks at Shiloh
Just to see how they would run ?
? We are sons of holy Dinah
And we"ll go where we"ve a mind to ?
? But right now we"re inclined to
Go home and rest a spell ?
? But when we"re tired of eatin"
We will give them Yanks a beatin" ?
? And they"ll all be retreatin"
When we give the rebel yell ?
[whoops]
How many Yankees can one Southerner whup?
[aII soIdiers] Five!
- [standing soIdier] How many?
- [aII soIdiers] Ten!
[standing soIdier] That"s more Iike it!
One company of Southerners armed with popguns couId run a whoIe regiment of Yankees cIean out of the country!
[standing soIdier] - Am I right?
[aII soIdiers] - Right!
- Gettin" off?
- No.
- Thought maybe I"d get your seat.
- No, just stretching.
Look at that cannon!
WouId you mind?
Don"t be ornery, BiII.
Let him see it.
Yankee army issue!
Where"d you get it?
I say, where"d you get it?
Took it off a dead Yank.
Which battIe?
BattIe for our hen coop!
That"s aII any of them Yankees are, chicken steaIers.
You hear that?
Chicken steaIers!
[conductor] Station-stop,
Kingston, Kingston.
What do you think you"re doing?
He didn"t mean any harm.
He just can"t heIp pIaying jokes on peopIe.
I wasn"t speaking to you. Why"d you go and pIay a cheap Yankee trick Iike that?
You"re right weIcome to the seat.
I was just havin" a IittIe fun.
I"II be dogged if he can"t even taIk Iike a Yankee.
Sit down here, pint-pot, and see if you can teach me.
[Pittenger] In spite of Campbell and
Buffum, we all reached Marietta in safety
and spent a restless night
in the Railroad Hotel.
With the dawn, we were
ready for the big day.
Two fair days in a row.
You don"t know what that sun means to us.
What are the fine cIothes for, Mr. Andrews?
Today I"m an officiaI of the Western and AtIantic RaiIroad.
- A very high officiaI, I hope.
- You are the president, at Ieast!
It"s 1 5 minutes tiII train time.
You know what you have to do.
Let"s have a finaI check.
Which of you are buying tickets to AIIatoona?
Kingston? CaIhoun?
Resaca?
And Chattanooga?
Good. That way it won"t appear we"re traveIing together.
Knight, Brown and AIf WiIson, sit cIose to me.
One Iast thing: When the train stops at Big Shanty for breakfast, keep your seats tiII I give you the signaI.
Good Iuck, gentIemen.
- Mr. Andrews?
- Mr. Ross?
After you outIined the pIan Iast night,
BiII CampbeII and I got to taIking it over.
Tearing up the track behind us and burning the bridges aII makes sense, but why steaI the train at Big Shanty?
It"s a breakfast stop for the crew as weII as the passengers.
There"s no teIegraph there, either.
There"s a Confederate camp with 4,000 men.
Must we steaI an engine in fuII view of the Southern army?
Know any pIace they won"t suspect it?
Yes. Any deserted part of the track north of this town.
- [Andrews] That"d mean a fight.
- What"s the matter with a fight?
- You never know how it"II come out.
- I know how I"m coming out.
I"ve had a beIIyfuI of this bowin" and scrapin" and sweet-taIking every
Ioudmouth Sesech in the state of Georgia.
If you want to capture this train in a fair fight, you can count on me.
If you don"t, I ain"t going.
Mr. CampbeII, your company commander said you"d be worth ten in a fight.
That"s why I brought you aIong, just in case.
But we didn"t come to fight.
We came to burn raiIroad bridges.
If you don"t Iike the pIan, you"re free to drop out now.
If you come, you"II do it my way.
[train beII]
[train beII]
- CIoudin" over.
- Yeah. Is it gonna rain?
Might couId. It rains one minute, shines the next.
[conductor] AII aboard!
[train whistIe]
- Good morning, conductor.
- Morning.
Didn"t you get on at Marietta?
Yes.
You mind if we have a word?
What do you know about those men?
Is there anything remarkabIe about them?
It"s the first time that many passengers ever got on at Marietta.
And aII together, too. Now they"re making out Iike they don"t even know each other.
If they"re deserters, I"ve got orders to turn them over to the authorities at Big Shanty.
Why are you teIIing me this?
Because you seem to be with "em.
- You don"t miss much, do you?
- Not much, Mr. Andrews.
- You know my name?
- You"ve ridden the train before.
AII right. In a way you"re an officiaI, so I can teII you this.
Those men are on government business, bound for Yankee Iand, and so am I.
BIockade running?
Maybe that. Maybe something more.
You don"t get a Ietter Iike that from Brigadier GeneraI Beauregard
- just for running quinine.
- No, I reckon you don"t.
I"d give my right arm to serve under that man.
You are.
This raiIroad is the artery that pumps fresh bIood in the army of the Mississippi on the Ieft hand, and the army of Northern Virginia on the right.
Beauregard and Robert E. Lee wouId perish without men Iike you.
WeII, thank you.
[train whistIe]
Station stop. Big Shanty.
Twenty minutes for breakfast.
Our inspector, Mr. Murphy, is on board today.
He"d be mighty proud to have you take breakfast with us.
Thank you, but I"ve aIready eaten.
My name"s WiIIiam FuIIer.
Have a good meaI, Mr. FuIIer, and don"t worry about deserters.
I"II take care of your train.
[train beII]
- Work up an appetite?
- Mr. Murphy did. He brought her in.
Keeping your hand in?
Come on, boys.
It"s time to go now.
UncoupIe here.
Get in.
Come on, boys.
When it"s orders from Beauregard, we can"t keep the GeneraI waiting.
Let her roII.
Thank you, Dixie.
What"s been happening in Big Shanty?
Right smart nothing.
- Who did it? Did you see "em?
- Deserters from the camp, most IikeIy.
They won"t go far.
We"re through pIaying Rebs!
We"re Yankees again!
I can taIk! I can open my mouth!
Go ahead!
Repairmen. Andrews is taIking to them.
He borrowed their tooIs.
I don"t know why we have to take the South.
If Andrews asked for it, they"d give it to him.
If we"d taken aII their tooIs instead of asking ""pretty pIease,"" we might"ve got a handspike with a cIaw on it.
Let a reaI man handIe it, BiII.
Put haIf of them in the car nearest the tender.
- It"s aII we couId find in the tooIbox.
- We"II have to make "em do.
Think we"re being foIIowed?
Can"t be. There"s no train south of us short of AtIanta, and they"II have to go to Marietta before they can send out a teIegram.
The onIy train we"ve got to worry about is that freight we"re due to pass at Kingston.
That torn track"II bIock everything beIow us, and once we get that wire cut, they can"t send warning to those above.
Tighter yet.
A IittIe more. There.
Now cut it at the next poIe and take a
Iength with us. Nobody"II catch us then.
Did you get a Iook at "em?
The men who stoIe my train?
- StoIe, is it?
- Yeah. Did they stop?
- They did.
- What for?
The officiaI stepped down and borrowed some tooIs.
- A Mr. Andrews?
- I didn"t ask. He came from Beauregard.
That"s the one.
- Who were they? Conscripts?
- No, a Mr. Andrews.
He got on at Marietta with some Secret Service men.
- He showed me a Ietter from Beauregard.
- An authorization?
No. It was right much an order to heIp out any way we couId.
I"II heIp him when I get to that teIegraph in AIIatoona.
Maybe next time you"II stop and ask if he is an army man.
We"II need that push car.
Take it and weIcome, Mr. Murphy.
Hoist it up, boys.
? Blow the whistle, clear the track
When I"m gone I won"t be back ?
? My pappy was a railroadin" man ?
? Well, I stole a locomotive
Just to take a ride ?
Be quiet!
We"re coming to a station.
What station?
- AIIatoona.
- Just a crossroads.
? I stole a locomotive
Just to take a ride ?
? "Cause my pappy
was a railroadin" man ?
Brown, you wanna take her?
Keep her down.
We gotta run on scheduIe.
Jump!
You aII right?
Those scoundreIs are spies, but not for Beauregard.
OnIy damn Yankees wouId do a trick Iike that.
Whatever they"re up to, they mean business.
Sit on the front facing forward, Jeff.
You"re an oId hand at watching the tracks.
Mr. Andrews!
There"s an iron works four miIes east.
That must be her yard engine.
Hadn"t we better destroy her?
Not worth the risk.
We"re too cIose to Kingston.
Ease on through the station, but don"t stop.
Let "em hear the beII.
[beII rings]
- We"re sIowing down.
- Get ready.
There"s a Iocomotive back there and he ran right on by it.
- I thought we were wrecking this raiIroad.
- Give him a chance, wiII ya?
- Can you get a message to Kingston?
- No, the Iine"s gone dead.
- They"re cutting the wire between stations.
- Who is?
The Yankees that stoIe my train!
Hey, Reid! They"ve taken up a raiI two miIes south.
Get a fIagman down there to stop any train from AtIanta.
[train beII]
AII right, boys. I"m gonna wait here for the southbound train.
There"s a train on the sidetrack.
Goes between here and Rome.
Waiting for AtIanta passengers.
PuII past the switch, then back in ahead of her.
CouIdn"t we make it into AdairsviIIe?
No, we might run head-on into that southbound freight.
We"ve gotta wait.
You boys oiI up the engine.
You"re too busy to bother with anybody.
Understand?
I"II do the taIking.
Looks Iike I"II have to do pIenty.
Hand me that wrench.
I reckon I don"t know you.
It"s their engine, aII right.
But there ain"t none of their men aboard.
GentIemen, I"ve taken this train by government authority and I"m running it through to Beauregard.
Where"s Jeff Cain and FuIIer?
They were fitting out another train when we Ieft AtIanta.
I got a dispatch for FuIIer to wait here untiI the southbound freight passes.
He"II be aIong. The southbound freight may have to wait for him.
What you got in them boxcars?
Enough ammunition to bIow this depot to kingdom come.
One of them was pointing toward us.
They aII Iook mighty suspicious.
From the north.
AII right, boys. Here we go.
[Andrews] Engineer!
I"m running an ammunition train down to Beauregard.
- WiII you puII down and cIear the tracks?
- You can"t take no train north. Not yet.
- [engineer] There"s another behind me.
- Pete Bracken"s express freight?
[engineer] No, one that ain"t scheduIed.
- Can"t be.
- Maybe there can"t be but there is.
Ain"t you heard the news?
A Yankee generaI named MitcheII marched down and captured HuntsviIIe yesterday.
[train yard worker] I"II be darned!
[engineer] Took every train on the Memphis and CharIeston road.
We"re hauIing bacon out of Chattanooga before the Yankees get there.
If you tried to get through to Beauregard now, you"d run right smack into oId Mitch.
Didn"t Ledbetter go to defend Chattanooga?
He"II try.
Then he"II need ammunition even more than Beauregard.
WiII you puII your train way down so that other freight can cIear?
[steam puffing]
- It"s Knight. Can you hear me?
- Go ahead.
- We"II have to wait Ionger than pIanned.
- [Pittenger] What"s up?
MitcheII got through yesterday.
Captured HuntsviIIe.
The enemy is running extra freight trains and cIogging up the road.
He got through. We"re too Iate!
I"m getting out of here!
Shut up and Iisten.
Andrews says to Iie Iow and wait.
If these foIks get too suspicious, be ready to jump out and give it to "em hot and fast.
- What"II be our signaI?
- A pistoI shot.
If the station master tries to send a message up the Iine, we might shoot him.
That"s more Iike it.
Yonah!
[Murphy and FuIIer] Yonah! Wait for us!
- UncoupIe your cars, HiIIy!
- We gotta borrow your engine.
Get on the tender, boys. We"re chasing down Yankees, and we need your guns.
We"ve got orders to report to Camp MacDonaId.
Can"t get through today.
The track"s out beIow.
What do you want to do, driII or shoot Yankees? Come on!
Open her up, HiIIy!
Let"s stoke that peanut burner.
Something"s wrong.
Something"s bad wrong, I teII you.
- How Iong?
- 45 minutes.
Burn their bridges, wiII we?
Looks Iike we burned our own!
CampbeII!
You"II wait here, Iike the rest.
That"s an order.
We ain"t in uniform now.
- We"re stiII soIdiers.
- No, we ain"t.
We"re Yankee contraband smuggIed into a boxcar by a sIick-taIking bIockade runner.
He hasn"t faiIed us yet.
AII right.
I"II give him five more minutes.
I teII you, I know BiII FuIIer.
Ain"t a better man on the state road.
He wouIdn"t be this Iate without Ietting us know.
Why don"t you teIegraph AtIanta and find out?
The Iine to the south"s gone dead!
Maybe our friend here can teII us why.
I don"t know why.
There are many things about how this road is run I wouIdn"t attempt to expIain.
But I can teII you this: If Beauregard couId get his orders fiIIed by reguIar channeIs without these ruinous deIays, he wouIdn"t have sent me to bring his powder through.
It"s a shame you foIks have to wait for the train.
But it"s more of a shame to bIock the road with ordinary traveI when the fate of brave soIdiers hangs in the baIance.
Mr. Andrews? I"II get you through.
I"II get an authorization to cIear that track for you
- if I have to go aII the way to Richmond.
- No! You needn"t do that.
Why not?
Because...
[train whistIe]
That freight"s coming in now.
- You can throw that switch now.
- Don"t reckon I wiII.
If you was aII you cIaimed to be, we"d have heard from the road superintendent of you,
- I ain"t throwing no switch untiI we do.
- I"m not above doing it.
- Sorry, Pops.
- Who do you think you are?
Think you own the whoIe raiIroad?
Take your hat off to Andrews.
He got us past the big one.
Yeah.
You don"t seem very happy about it.
When I was a IittIe boy, my father
Iocked me in a cIoset for 1 4 hours.
I aIways obeyed him after that, but I never Iiked him much.
You"re not going to side with him?
No, it"s Iike Pittenger said.
I"m stiII a soIdier.
GeneraI MitcheII shouId"ve put someone in command.
- He put Andrews.
- I mean, a soIdier to give proper orders.
Like Ross here, or Pittenger, or Knight.
I got so used to taking orders,
I feeI kinda Iost without "em.
Andrews said to forget we"d ever been soIdiers.
He"d better pray we don"t.
PuII around that bend and stop.
We"ve gotta cut the wire again.
[train whistIe]
They"ve gone! They got away!
Come on, men!
- Why"d you Iet those Yankees get away?
- Yankees?
- I thought they was Beauregard"s men.
- I toId you!
- They"re Yankee spies. How many?
- Four.
Try to get a message to every station up the Iine, quick.
They"re probabIy cutting wires right now.
Stephens! Did Pete Bracken bring in his express freight?
Not yet. They"re both extras.
- The Yankees may run into them.
- They know the scheduIe.
Come on, boys!
PiIe on!
[train whistIe]
Bracken"s freight!
- Here"s your coffee, Mr. Bracken.
- Thank you, Henry.
Henry!
Put it in reverse, Pete.
What you men doing here?
Where"s your train, Mr. FuIIer?
Yankees got it. Back into AdairsviIIe.
We"II drop these cars off at a sidin".
- Bring her back, we"II expIain Iater.
- Watch my signaIs, now.
[train whistIe]
Yankees stoIe our train.
Come on!
- My name is Cox.
- I"m AIonso Martin.
- How can we heIp?
- Pass wood to the fireman.
- We can do that.
- There may be fighting Iater on.
I reckon we can do that, too.
Those Yankees stiII have to pass the Morning Express from Chattanooga.
If she"s running on time, she shouId be in CaIhoun now.
She won"t stop Andrews. He taIked his way past three trains at Kingston.
He taIked me onto a sidin".
He"II try to persuade them they"ve got a cIear track beIow, and we"II run into her.
What do you want me to do, run her at haIf speed?
No. Open her up.
I"II watch the track for you.
Keep that whistIe going! Let "em know we"re on their taiI so they won"t rip up track!
[train whistIe]
- When did those Yankees puII outta here?
- Yankees? What Yankees?
Powder-train Yankees. They stoIe the GeneraI at Big Shanty.
- When"d they Ieave?
- Ten minutes ago.
Grab aII the men and guns you can find and foIIow us. We"re gonna run "em down.
- Your teIegraph working?
- No, but there"s the operator from DaIton.
Come on here, sIim.
- Why aren"t you up at DaIton"s?
- Got a dispatch saying the wire was dead, so I rode the express down to find the break and fix it.
Yankees have been cutting the wire.
Come on.
I want you to take down a teIegram to GeneraI Ledbetter in Chattanooga.
When we get to DaIton, we"II drop you off so you can send it.
""My train was captured by FederaI spies making for Chattanooga,
""possibIy hoping to burn bridges behind them.
""If I do not capture them,
""try to head them off.
""Signed, WiIIiam A. FuIIer.""
It"s the Iast time we"re gonna have to do this, boys.
- Get one end free, we"II do the rest.
- Now you"re using your head.
Shimmy up there, monkey boy.
When we get this one up, we"II have Ieft broken track for every train south of us, and cIear road ahead aII the way into Chattanooga.
- No more Kingston, sir?
- What was the matter with Kingston?
I"ve been in tight pIaces, but that"s the first time I"ve been a Iive corpse in a coffin!
That"s aII behind us now.
[train whistIe]
- Who are they?
- Must be that express train.
- ShaII we wreck her?
- They might wreck us.
They wouIdn"t be coming Iike that without a force on board.
Knight, how about it?
We"ve got as good a Iocomotive as ever need to be.
With cIear track ahead, it"II outrun anything we"ve passed yet.
Then Iet her go.
Give her every ounce of steam she"s got.
Put that raiI on board!
LiveIy!
[train whistIe]
Knock the ends out of aII the cars, boys.
Make a waIkway aII the way through.
[banging]
[train whistIe]
[train whistIe]
[train whistIe]
[train whistIe]
Stop her when we"re weII past the trestIe, then reverse and run at haIf speed as soon as I give you the signaI.
Boys! Bring your coats!
We"re gonna drop that car.
- Buffum?
- Yes?
PuII the pin.
[Andrews] Push her back!
[Andrews] Push her back!
Aren"t we gonna stop and see the fun, sir?
AII I want to see is the first bridge over the Chicamauga going up in fIames.
Reverse! Reverse!
Come on!
TeII Pete Bracken we"II do another fIying switch at the first siding.
[train beIIs]
DaIton. Way ahead of time.
We gotta take on wood and water.
Not here.
Stop at the first tank beyond town.
- Watch my Sunday suit!
- Been raining up here.
Might"ve been, but it"s cIeared up nice.
- ShaII we rip up track?
- Nope.
Let"s get a wood Iine going.
Mr. Scott?
[teIegraph operator] ""My train was captured by FederaI spies making for Chattanooga,
""possibIy hoping to burn the bridges behind them.
""If I do not capture them, try to head them off. Signed, WiIIiam A. FuIIer.""
So that"s why MitcheII hasn"t attacked me!
He wants to be sure those bridges are out.
AcknowIedge and send this message back.
""Direct to DaIton operator to caII CoIoneI
AIIen"s regiment to engage the Yankees.""
The Iine to DaIton"s gone dead!
Then caII RinggoId, and teII him to send cavaIry down the track to cut them off.
They"re more than haIf water-Iogged.
ProbabIy those bridges are, too.
[train whistIe]
Back on board, boys!
UncoupIe that Iast car.
- Think it"II stop "em?
- No, but it"II sIow "em down.
We"II stop them further up the track.
[Andrews] WiIson! Hop on.
This is no time to think about food!
I"m not! I"m thinking of a hot, quick fire to heIp that wet wood!
[Andrews] Bring it around.
This oughta be a good pIace.
Watch your fingers.
Dig it out a IittIe bit in here.
[train whistIe]
Run at haIf speed.
This time, we"re gonna see what happens.
- Reverse!
- Reverse!
Won"t anything stop that train?
We wiII.
How Iong is that tunneI?
Through the top of the hiII.
Mr. Andrews, we want to stop and have it out with them.
That"s right.
- We can ambush them inside that tunneI.
- How?
- Send this boxcar back to smash into "em.
- They might just push it out again.
Then reverse our engine and send it back, too. How about it?
WeII, how about it?
- What are we sIowing for?
- I ordered them to stop.
We don"t want to go in there bIind.
And give the Yankees time to burn a bridge?
They"re not burning any bridge, they"re tearing up track.
- They won"t have time if we crowd "em.
- Throwing our Iives away won"t heIp.
You boys jump off.
Get down, Pete, I"II take her.
I"II fire for you, Mr. FuIIer.
Open her up, Pete. If we"re going to gIory, we may as weII go a"kiting.
It"s time the army showed the Secret Service how to fight.
I"m gonna stop this train.
CampbeII...
Nobody stops this train untiI we reach the first Chicamagua bridge.
I know it"s hard on you men.
I"ve been tempted to stop, too.
But we can"t risk any encounter that might Iose us our engine.
Even after we burn the bridges, we"ve got to get through to MitcheII and Iet him know.
You needn"t worry about us, Mr. Andrews.
Any of us.
If we don"t wood up soon, we won"t go much farther.
Once we set the first bridge afire, we"II have pIenty of time to hunt for wood.
Any of that coaI-oiI Ieft?
Just a sIosh.
Take it back to the boxcar.
Back in the tender, men.
Go ahead!
[train whistIe]
Back up! Try her again!
They set the brake!
Push her out!
There"s gotta be wood somewhere.
There"s a wood station just this side of RinggoId.
Knight!
- Can you get another miIe out of her?
- I don"t know.
She"s aII right.
Hey, Bracken!
Come on, Pete!
Let"s go!
There"s onIy one thing for it.
We"II have to get out and push.
I"m so used to seeing train smoke behind,
I thought she was chasing us again!
That"s just the smoke from the bridge.
I know, but I thought I saw it move.
It is moving! Pittenger, Iook!
It is moving!
Yeah, you"re very funny, you two.
It"s no joke.
AII right, you"ve been spoiIing for a fight.
You might as weII have it now.
Jump down and get a barricade across the track.
Try to coax her around the bend.
It"II Iook better if they don"t see her.
[train whistIe]
[whoops and hoofbeats]
CavaIry!
That settIes it.
Scatter and make for the woods, boys.
Get home the best way you can.
[Pittenger] So, we left the field to the
victors, whoever they might be.
We couldn"t have guessed all our plans
were wrecked by the fantastic courage
and determination of one man:
The mild-mannered conductor,
William A. Fuller.
The great locomotive chase was over,
but our troubles were just beginning.
For a week, the country below
Chattanooga was in an uproar,
with soldiers and citizens beating the
backwoods to find the ""engine thieves. ""
I was taken, along with many other
suspicious characters,
to Chattanooga to be questioned at the
headquarters of General Ledbetter.
When it came my turn, I represented
myself as a Southern sympathizer,
ready to join their army.
Another recruit, GeneraI.
A Mr. Pittenger from FIemingsburg, Kentucky.
- Where"d they find him?
- Wandering the hiIIs above Lafayette.
What were you doing there?
I was on my way to Camp MacDonaId.
- Oh, a conscript?
- No, sir, a voIunteer.
Why don"t you join us?
- I"d be proud to, sir.
- Good.
I think we have just the pIace for a smart young Iad Iike you.
- Take care of him, FIetcher.
- Yes, sir.
Did you ever see any of these men before?
No.
That"s strange, mighty strange.
Every Iast one of them"s from FIemingsburg, Kentucky.
[Pittenger] Our suffering in prison
would"ve been easier to bear
had we not thought our raid a failure.
We could not know that the Southern
newspapers, praising Fuller"s bravery,
were amazed and alarmed that
a handful of Yankee soldiers
had almost wrecked the Confederacy.
Full 50 times our number
had to be diverted
from Confederate battle lines
for guarding their railroads and bridges.
All we knew was that official orders
transferred us from jail to jail...
Chattanooga, Madison, Knoxville.
Now we were being moved again.
Where are you taking "em, Major?
AtIanta.
Why not just hang "em up in Chattanooga?
Gotta have a court-martiaI triaI for them first.
Ain"t there no Iawyers in Chattanooga?
- I have orders from Richmond.
- No offense, Major.
Mr. FuIIer?
May I have a word with you?
You had a word with me, going north.
You"re going south now.
[mumbIing]
- No taIking in the yard.
- How many Yanks can you Iick today?
Any more troubIe out of you, we put you down the hoIe.
- Captain, assembIe your prisoners.
- Line them up, CorporaI.
[CorporaI] Line "em up.
Got to read them the sentence of the court-martiaI.
- What"s the verdict?
- GuiIty. AII of them.
I heard they were just hanging the ringIeader.
So did I, but the orders from Richmond said different.
""Hang every Iast one of them, on or before the 1 5th.""
[prisoners]? Roll, Jordan, roll ?
? Roll, Jordan, roll ?
? I want to go to heaven
When I die ?
? For to hear old Jordan roll ?
? Roll, Jordan, roll ?
Why not go ask the captain of the guard to Iend you his master key?
Then you"d have something to go by.
? I want to go to heaven
When I die ?
? For to hear old Jordan roll ?
- Hey, boys!
- Sir?
[guard] Give us Tenting Tonight.
? We"re tenting tonight
On the old camp ground ?
? Give us a song to cheer?
? Our weary hearts a song of hope ?
? And friends we love so dear?
? Many are the hearts
That are weary tonight ?
? Wishing for the war to cease ?
? - Many are the hearts... ?
- Look!
Look what Knight...
What"s going on in there?
Why"d you stop singing?
Why don"t you give us the rest of it?
? Many are the hearts
That are weary tonight ?
? Wishing for the war to cease ?
? Many are the hearts
Looking for the right ?
? To see the dawn of peace ?
? Tenting tonight
Tenting tonight ?
? Tenting on the old camp ground ?
[snoring]
[Andrews] So far, so good.
Knight, you give me the key.
Tomorrow when the guards herd us inside after our breathing time in the yard,
I"II sIip under Mr. Turner"s bed and hide there untiI dark.
When I"m sure he"s asIeep,
I"II tie him up and gag him, steaI his ceII keys and unIock the doors.
Then we creep past the guards, cIimb the waII and run for the woods.
[Pittenger] No.
We won"t do it that way.
Mr. Andrews, you keep forgetting we"re soIdiers.
We trained together, and we know how to fight together.
We"d rather fight than scheme.
Now you"re taIking Iike a man.
If we try to sneak out one by one, onIy the first wiII get away.
- The rest"II be cornered.
- That"s right.
How wouId you go at it?
I"d wait untiI around suppertime, when it"s Iight enough to see what we"re doing.
I"d grab Mr. Turner, take his keys, and rush the guards outside in a body.
It"II be sudden. Bare hands against muskets, they won"t expect.
- Good!
- It"s aII right!
What do you think, Mr. Andrews?
Yes, it"s a good pIan.
Go ahead, Pittenger.
Assign us our positions.
I think Buffum and I Iook the Ieast dangerous, so we"II take care of Mr. Turner.
We"II want the biggest men to rush the guards.
CampbeII, you"re the first.
Then Ross, I guess.
Through with them bread tins, boys?
Boys, I"m sorry about the hangin".
That"s aII right, Mr. Turner.
We"ve aII got to go sometime.
WouId you be good enough to ask the captain of the guard to fix my chain?
Why...!
- CorporaI, post your guard.
- MacDonaId and Irvine, south post.
Get back!
Guards!
[gunshot]
Get back in!
Try the waII!
Guards!
TaII ones heIp the others over the waII.
Outside! They"re cIimbing the waIIs!
Head "em off outside!
Around back!
Come on! Get over!
Go on! Go!
[gunshots]
- Is that aII you caught?
- So far.
I got the two big ones upstairs.
You needn"t have come back to heIp me.
I didn"t.
I had to see how many of "em it"d take to Iay me out.
You mean, you"d hang for that?
Yeah. Any day in the week.
You shouIdn"t hate them that much.
I don"t. Not anymore.
I thought they was a bag of wind, but they ain"t.
They done aII right.
You done aII right, too.
You reaIIy showed "em.
There"s one more thing we"re gonna have to show "em.
What"s that?
That we know how to die.
Mr. FuIIer?
WeII, Reverend Scott!
"Morning, sir.
You riding with us today?
No, I"ve been to the jaiI, praying with the condemned prisoners.
One of them, a Mr. Andrews, asked to see you.
I gave him my promise you"d come.
He had a fair triaI, and I gave aII my testimony to the court.
Anything further I might have to say to him wouId be of smaII comfort to him now.
Mr. Andrews?
Thank you for coming.
Mr. FuIIer, I wanted you to know
I"m sorry I had to deceive you.
I guess you"II be paying for it.
Yes. I"m gonna hang.
I wasn"t taIking about that.
You whipped me fair and square, but now that it"s aII over,
I hoped you wouIdn"t hoId a grudge.
I haven"t much use for a man who poses as a IoyaI Southerner, and isn"t.
I was fighting for my convictions.
My onIy weapons were the Iies a spy must teII.
You fought in your way;
I fought in mine.
Some day the fighting wiII be over, and both sides wiII have to shake hands.
I won"t be aIive to see that day.
CouIdn"t we do it now?
I"d be gIad if you wouId, sir.
Your Ieader was a most unusuaI man; resourcefuI, brave and true.
So were your comrades who perished with him.
As soIdiers, they wiII receive, posthumousIy, the same award you are wearing now.
Though the CongressionaI order must excIude Mr. Andrews himseIf, as a civiIian, he wiII receive an even higher decoration; the commendation of history.
Because you dared and suffered with him,
I know he wouId be as proud to have his men receive this honor as we are to bestow it.
That means a great deaI to us, sir.
Thank you.

Our logbook.
The diary of our journey.
My friends and I, we just had the best adventure ever!
We went on a voyage of discovery
- back into prehistory.
Like other boys playing cowboys and indians.
There were four of us.
That's me, Petr, holding the book.
In the middle is Jirka, the youngest in our team.
Beside him is Jenda.
Toník isn't there. He took the photo.
But you can see his shadow.
He was our photographer.
Here, by the cave, where that cross is, that's where Jirka found this.
That's what started it all.
This is not any old stone.
It is a fossilised trilobite.
Jirka didn't know that trilobites had died out long ago,
so he wanted to see a live one.
He didn't know this was once a seabed covered by an ocean full of trilobites.
It's only thanks to their fossils that we even know what they looked like.
So he could imagine it better, we showed him on this chart
how there were 500 million years between us and this trilobite.
And if he wanted to see a real one,
he'd have to go back into the past,
right down these giant steps:
past the Ice Age,
through the Tertiary,
down to the Mesozoic
and the Paleozoic,
and all the way back to the Silurian seas and the trilobites!
So he could understand it better, we took him to the museum.
He looked at more fossils, a lot rarer and a lot bigger.
Toník even took a picture of him with a mammoth.
Jirka loved it,
but was sad he would never see one alive.
If there were only mammoths like that out in the woods!
Dead bones and artists' impressions just aren't the same.
What Jirka really wanted was to see them move!
So when he read the Jules Verne book
about people going to the centre of the Earth
and seeing 'antediluvian monsters',
he thought we could do the same.
And since almost everything in Jules Verne books came true,
we decided to go.
To sail upriver into that cave,
our magic cave!
That's where our journey began...
Ice...
- Seriously, there's ice here.
- Never mind, keep rowing!
We're still moving, aren't we?
Yes, but it'll soon get worse.
Look at all that ice!
That looks really like the Ice Age.
We'll never get past that icepack.
Even an icebreaker wouldn't make it!
We have to try.
First put on something warm!
Jirka put this on!
Down over the ears or you'll get frostbite!
Hand me the lamp.
Here we go!
- Careful!
- Careful, Jirka!
Don't worry. It can hold us.
Guys, get out and we'll drag the boat over the ice, like a sled.
- Good idea.
- Come on guys!
Let's go.
- A bit more.
- Everything in the boat!
It will be alright as long as we keep moving!
It won't be easy...
Take some. They've got jam in!
- Thanks, they're super!
- Another one?
We must be careful with this, Jirka.
It's our expedition logbook.
Let's write something now!
And so we wrote our first entry,
how we made our camp in the Ice Age.
That really was an Ice Age
our faces and fingers were frozen stiff, but that didn't matter.
We were just happy we got this far.
Jirka was the happiest of all,
he got exactly what he had wished for
- an adventurer's trek into the great unknown.
The next day we were back on our way again
on the open river.
There was a lot less ice now,
and the further we got, the more bushes and trees there
were just like back home.
Then the ice disappeared completely.
Guys! Look over there!
By the fir trees!
- It's a mammoth! - Really!?
- Let's get closer!
A mammoth!
A real mammoth, boys!
What a giant!
- Hurry up, let me see!
- Me too!
- Quickly!
- Wait!
- Let me see!
- Quiet, you guys!
He's not paying any attention to us at all!
Hello!
Hello! Hellooo! Hellooo!
Mr Mammoth, are we in the right place in prehistory? Hello!
Sit down!
When we set up camp, we talked only about the mammoth, especially Jirka.
It was much better than the one in the museum.
It was a real live animal.
The first one we'd seen in the prehistoric world.
We set off at first light.
There were some glaciers on the horizon,
but the landscape had changed completely.
Everything was green now and it felt almost like home.
But water from the glaciers was flooding the river,
and we couldn't row against the strong current.
Jenda, look! A path!
- There!
- Right there!
Guys, what did you find?
Come and have a look.
Wait, I'll pull you in.
Don't fall! Easy now, hold tight!
It's some kind of a path.
The mammoths must have made it.
- But there are no tracks here.
- Maybe animals come here to drink?
Let's see where it leads.
Why not! Come on!
Careful, don't go in!
You never know what might be inside.
Look. There's a campfire!
Maybe there's a man living here.
- A prehistoric hunter.
- What if he's in?
I don't think so.
It's too overgrown now.
- Wait, I've made a torch.
- Okay, you go first!
There's nobody here.
Someone was here and he made a fire.
And he was a hunter, look!
Now that's cool!
And heavy.
- What is it anyway?
- What do you think Petr?
They must be antlers from a giant stag.
I'd like to have seen that one!
He must have been amazing!
And strong, carrying two hundred pounds on his head!
What's over here, guys?
Fellas, it won't budge.
- How about this one?
- Let me see.
Wow, that is a bone!
Must be a mammoth's tusk.
Yes, but only about a third of it.
Think about it guys!
- Let's take it with us.
- Sure, and who's going to carry it?
Here's another find, Petr.
That's the caveman's axe.
He attacks mammoths with this?
He must be a hell of a fighter.
A brutal savage...
Just as well he's not home right now.
Guys, what if he comes back...?
I don't know, but I think there's a tunnel back there.
We'd better check.
Just in case...
Careful, Jenda!
Petr!
Animal paintings!
Bison.
That was our biggest surprise of all in this cave,
those animal paintings.
That hunter had etched his thoughts and feelings right there on the rock.
He hunted deer and bison,
but he could also paint them,
like a master.
We'd all seen the mammoth by the river,
but none of us could have drawn it like he did.
The caveman stopped being just a butcher of animals for us.
We no longer feared him.
He was a human being, just like us.
Petr, you sure we can't take anything?
No, Jirka. How do you think we'd carry that?
- Toník was right.
- Pity.
Toník's gone outside already!
Come on, let's go after him.
We have to move on.
Toník, where are you going?
- Don't worry, I'll be right back!
- Hurry up! We're heading to the river!
I'll just get a few more pictures!
Toník!
- Toník!
- We called in vain.
Toník wouldn't let go of the caveman's trail.
He wanted to find him and get a picture.
It would be the first photo ever of a live caveman.
He imagined what a sensation it would be,
so he went further and further into the woods,
deeper into the unknown forest.
- Can you see him?
- No.
- Look harder!
- I can't see him anywhere.
So get down, and we'll have to go look for him.
Something must have happened to him.
Look! Do you see that?
Look, over there!
Petr, do you know what they are?
Woolly rhinos, I think.
Definitely! Woolly rhinos!
So the fight is over.
Jirka, let's go!
We have to find Toník.
We're wasting time.
Guys, it's swimming towards us!
Jirka, what's wrong with you?
Shush! There, on the ridge!
He's coming this way!
Who's coming?
The caveman, with a spear.
Look! Behind the bushes!
- Toník!
- Look at you!
Guys! You have no idea what I've just been through!
I've been looking all over for you lot!
Guys, make some space.
Stand there with the spear,
Toník, like a hunter.
- This will be some picture!
- Get away, I'm taking the photo.
Look this way. Smile!
All done!
Tonik finally dried out by the fire.
And I dutifully put everything in the log.
We wondered what would come next.
Most of our journey into the past still lay ahead of us.
Millions and millions of years before the time of mammoths
lay the Tertiary,
our next stop.
This is great!
- Welcome to the Tertiary!
- Hooray!
Sweaters off or we'll burn up.
Just like summer back home.
Jirka, do you see that?
Flamingos.
Look, over there on the other side!
This was an animal paradise.
Like you'd imagine in Africa.
There were gazelles, antelopes,
giraffes and elephants.
Only this was not our elephant.
This one was different a Tertiary-era elephant.
Deinotherium - with tusks growing from its lower jaw,
not like ours whose tusks grow from the top down.
Then there was this predator, also with tusks,
teeth actually sharp as a sabre.
On the hunt, it would kill on sight.
It was one of the most fearful beasts of the whole Tertiary.
Jirka wished we had a rifle, but it was good we didn't.
We were on a scientific mission, not a safari.
We just had to let nature be,
and observe.
Jirka!
Jirka!
Where is the kid gone again?
You just can't watch him!
Better go look after him.
- I'll go this way and you go there.
- OK.
Jirka!
Jirka!
Jirka!
Jirka!
Jirka!
Jirka!
- Jirka!
- Hear that?
It's Petr.
He can't find him either
Come on.
- Jirka!
- Jirka!
Jirka!
Jirka!
Jirka!
Guys!
What were you thinking?
Can't you hear?
Never mind that... just give me a hand here!
Wow!
What a catch!
You did it!
- Must be ten kilos at least!
- He looks tasty!
We'll have a feast tonight!
When we all got back to the boat
and saw how proud Jirka was,
we couldn't stay mad at him.
It was a fine catch after all!
So we named that Whale Bay
in Jirka's honour.
We gave all the mountains and bays names,
like all serious explorers do.
We used them for the maps in our logbook.
That's Thunder Mountain,
because we got caught there in a dreadful storm.
It was wild!
We decided to stay the night on the boat.
We couldn't light a fire in the rain
and were afraid to camp out without one.
First watch fell to me.
The rain finally stopped,
and it was a calm tropical night.
I was thinking about everything we'd seen so far,
and then about home.
- What was that?
- Nothing, Jirka.
Just the lamp.
Nothing but a small flame,
but it helped us so much.
As long as we had it, we felt safe.
What must it have been like
when Man lit the first torch,
when he discovered the secret of fire!
Since then, he's become the master of all creation.
Man as we know him.
Give them here!
Boy, the water's cold today!
Jirka!
Jirka!
Get the fire! Quickly!
Take that!
Swim to the boat!
Row! Let's get out of here!
The rest of our ride
was like a trip through a wonderful zoo in the Tertiary.
There were different animals
everywhere we looked, too many to name.
What a monster! Never seen anything that ugly before!
It has an even weirder name.
Uintatherium.
- What?
- Uintatherium.
- Uintataterium!
- Did you make that up?
- What a tongue twister!
- Stop laughing you lot!
It's scientifically correct.
It's not a joke.
Science needs names, so they have to make them up, for things like that.
They always use Latin or Greek, so they can be understood all around the world.
Made-up names sound okay in science, better than in ordinary language
I mean, it wouldn't sound good if it was called 'bumpyhead' or 'bubblenose', or whatever.
'Uintatherium' sounds a lot better.
Jirka, time to get up, it's morning!
- Let's go.
- Petr, hurry up!
Let's move it!
Phorusrhacos. Look!
See?
In the past whenever people
found parts of these animals, like a talon,
they figured it was from some flying demon.
So we have all these legends about places with dragons and basilisks,
and how strong and powerful they are.
We were about to enterjust such a world of dragons.
Not the legendary ones, the real ones, in the flesh.
As soon as we entered the Mesozoic
Jirka was on the lookout for 'monsters'.
So far, all we'd seen were bare rocks.
Nothing but stones and sand.
No, there's no sign of any dinosaurs.
- What about over there? Look!
- Where?
That's a dinosaur?
That thing?
That's just a turtle, a perfectly ordinary turtle!
OK, Jirka, see up there?
There's your dragons, flying beauties!
It's like an airshow!
Yep With prehistoric aircraft called Pteranodons.
They put on quite a show!
Guys, watch out!
I think it's coming down!
Duck!
Jirka!
Watch out!
Hold on! We'll go to the bank!
They're flying away!
I hope they don't come back!
Must have wanted to see what we were doing here.
We panicked for nothing. It says here they feed exclusively on live fish!
On live fish?
That's only because they had no people to eat back then!
You saw how wide its beak was!
Big bully!
Up to the shore, Jirka.
They'll leave us alone now, you'll see.
If only.
I'm soaked through!
Better come ashore, guys.
It's Jirka's turn to dry off.
Hey, guys, look at these trees!
Plants and bushes everywhere!
Over there, it's like a forest!
Almost like trees back home.
Especially those tall ones.
Pines, right?
They look like them, but they're called Araucarias.
They're full of resin, so they should make a great campfire.
And below them, what look like mini palm trees, they're cycads.
Some of them survived all the way into modern times, but the animals changed in all sorts of ways over millions of years.
Jirka! Petr!
What's that?
What do you think it is?
A Styracosaurus!
You'd think, going by the horns on its collar it would be pretty mean,
but in fact it was a dumb giant.
Its skull might be two metres,
but its brain was as small as a cat's.
Some faster reptiles passed us by,
but too quick for us to identify them!
And this lumbering fortress is Stegosaurus.
It looked like a robot animal
built by some mad professor!
The plates on its back protected it from attack. Like a knight in armour!
Bigger than a tank!
And when in danger,
it could use its barbed tail like a mace!
There were lots of weird creatures in the Mesozoic.
We saw another as we passed a rocky shore.
It was like half duck, half kangaroo.
What they called a Trachodon.
Jenda!
Shush!
I drew a picture of it, another one for our log!
But our biggest catch of all, the longest chapter in our log of the Mesozoic,
was for the Brontosaurus,
probably the largest land animal that ever lived.
The first time we saw it, we were scared stiff.
But curiosity overcame our fear.
We decided to get closer.
That mountain of meat didn't really pose much danger,
since it wasn't very smart.
Its brain was so tiny it couldn't control its enormous body,
so the Brontosaurus had a second brain
down by its backside!
It was lucky it could move at all.
Generally they preferred to stay in the water.
It helped support their giant bodies,
weighing in at as much as forty tons!
Go slower Jenda, so we can check him out.
- Don't be afraid.
- He's big!
Seems the mountain is turning towards us.
Yep, he's turning around to face us!
Maybe we should turn around too, just in case.
Alright, to the left.
- Guys, guys! Wait!
- What?
- I've got to get a picture of it.
- Oh that's great!
I can't go without one.
I totally forgot.
Hold on, keep still!
Thanks, we're done!
Look! He's noticed us!
- Seriously, he's coming towards us.
- I think we should go now!
Good idea!
"Studying the remains of extinct creatures,
"palaeontologists are able to..."
There's something moving over there.
It's like a walking rock or something.
It's a... Stegosaurus!
Pity it's so dark.
I can hardly see.
There! There's another one!
It just appeared!
As soon as it was day, we crossed the river
to look at the Stegosaurus.
It had to be dead.
It had been lying in the same place since the day before.
This was our one chance to see a dinosaur up close,
to touch it.
Maybe he's just asleep.
No way, he's dead.
Let's get closer!
Yeah, he's a goner.
Told you so.
He's well out of it.
Close up like this, you can see just how big it is.
Big as a tank.
Hello!
Lucky he's dead!
We can get a really good look at him.
It's not lucky. It's a shame!
He could have been our pet.
Now there's a bright idea!
I'd like to see you tame a thing that big!
- Like Androcles and the lion!
- Yeah, sure!
I'd heal his wounds, that's how!
You know, like Androcles helping the wounded lion and the lion followed him.
Everyone would be so jealous if I brought him home.
That would be amazing!
But there's something more important at stake here, Jirka
We didn't set out just to get famous or even have an adventure.
We really wanted to know what life was like in prehistoric times.
That was our goal.
We're so lucky to see all this with our own eyes.
That's why we're here.
We should take this chance write it all down draw, it and measure it.
I'll take photos of him from every side, Petr.
- Any details you want?
- Start over here with the head, just back up a bit and get down lower.
That's fine.
While you do that, I'll measure him and make a drawing.
I left the log in the boat.
Jirka, would you go and get it for me?
- Me again? Do I have to?
- We'll just get things ready.
- Go on!
- Alright!
- Anything for science...
- Good man!
Now do the other side and again just the head.
Petr, I've got a small notepad if you want it.
Thanks Jenda, that'll do for now.
Let's measure it by paces.
Start right by the head.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
Nine paces, Petr, to right here.
Nine steps, that's about eight metres.
- Now let's do the plate.
- Maybe by hand.
One, two, three, four, five, six.
That makes about sixty centimetres.
And now the width.
One, two, three, four, five, six.
The same, write it down.
Height... and width sixty, right?
Guys!
It's Jirka!
Something must have happened.
What happened?
A dinosaur smashed it.
From the size of the tracks it must have been huge.
Did you see it?
No, I didn't.
- It was already like this when I came.
- This is the end.
We'll never fix this.
It's totally wrecked.
The gear's okay.
The diary! The logbook, guys!
It's here! Untouched.
- At least we have that!
- But we can't go on.
Don't cry, Jirka, this is nothing.
We'll just build a raft.
There's no shortage of trees and we can keep going!
Right! We'll make it to the end.
Don't worry, we can do it!
We won't let a little thing like this stop us, Jirka.
We knew from experience that this fog on the river signalled another change.
It was like a curtain,
behind which a new world was waiting to be discovered,
older and stranger than before.
According to the plan this should be the Carboniferous,
a world of endless swamps and ponds.
It was kind of depressing and ominous.
There wasn't a single sound.
It was like nature had been cursed.
Petr, come here!
See, I think I know those trees!
- Which ones?
- There on the shore.
The ones by the water.
See?
They're horsetails, right?
Down there by the water, those are horsetails, but see those next to them?
They're giant moss plants, Lycopodia.
One day, instead of these weird trees, there'll be a mining rig standing right here.
This is where coal comes from, forming right now below our feet.
Men will come here to mine it one day.
But that's still millennia in the future.
Wait, I'll get rid of it.
There is a lot of this stuff!
Toník!
Wait, I'm coming.
Guys, that's not going to budge.
We won't be able to sail any further.
What did you expect?
- There's just no way through here.
- Okay, so now what?
We'll walk. We'll just take everything with us.
That's all.
Don't leave anything behind, guys.
We'll need everything for the rest of the trip.
Especially the logbook.
Be extra careful with that!
Jirka!
- Jirka come here! - Quiet!
- Carry something.
Quiet!
Do you hear? It's a cricket!
Somewhere over there.
Uh, any excuse.
Typical of him.
What could it be anyway?
Yeah, you know him.
He's always finding something.
Guys, I just found a carboniferous creature!
Show us!
Well, I'm no scientist, but that certainly wasn't chirping.
It's a centipede, you crickethead!
I know that, but I'll find it.
It's here, I can still hear it.
Don't go too far! The swamp's dangerous.
Don't get sucked in!
Jirka!
- Hello! Jirka!
- Come back!
- Jirka!
- Jirka!
The logbook, our logbook!
Get! Get!
Go on! Get away!
Go! Go! I'll teach you!
You monster! Get out of it!
Go on! Wow!
Go, go on, go!
- Do you hear that? It's him!
- At long last!
It's coming from over there!
This way.
Let's go get him, boys!
Before he gets lost in the swamp!
It's okay, he heard us!
Guys, this time we mustn't let him get away with it.
- He needs teaching a lesson!
- He's certainly earned it.
Hey guys, I'm back.
Glad I found you.
The whistling really helped.
You'll never guess what happened!
This lizard thing, like a salamander,
I don't know exactly what it was.
Petr would know.
Suddenly it stuck its head out at me and... know what I did?
No, but you're not acting like a member of an expedition.
You're just a boy, and nothing more!
Swamp everywhere and you run off God knows where!
I fought it and drove it away, and it was a terrible lizard!
Must have been!
Look at your pants!
What you need is a nappy.
From now on, you follow us!
- You don't believe me!
- Enough! Now come on!
I really fought it!
Just get, we have to find a place to camp before the sun goes down.
Jirka take this!
Did you hear me? Take it!
Jirka, come here!
See how great we've made it!
We'll sleep dry tonight!
Sir Jirka is not amused.
- What are you looking for?
- The logbook. I can't find it!
I packed it myself.
It must be here somewhere
You put it in the kitbag,
I saw it.
- Look again!
- I know, but it's not there.
Then it must have fallen out along the way.
Or when we climbed over those trees.
What will I do!?
Not much point looking for it in this swamp.
We don't even know how we got here...
This is bad.
It was the most important thing we had, that log.
Everything we recorded, it's all gone!
The logbook, that's it!
You're not acting like a member of an expedition.
"You're just a boy, and nothing more!" Isn't that what you said?
Guys, our Jirka.
- Sit here!
- So, let me see what it's like here!
This goes in the log!
Don't forget Jirka battling the salamander!
And how he found the logbook!
That was something!
Sure was! Jirka's biggest catch so far!
With our logbook back, it was like hope had returned
we nearly didn't finish it.
We crossed the maze of the carboniferous swamp
and there was just one last part of our journey left.
We stood on the shores of Siluria.
The Silurian Age; rocks and boulders,
as if the whole world was turned to stone.
Not a blade of grass,
not a bush, not even a beetle.
Just nothing.
Nothing could live here.
The sea!
For the first time in our lives, we saw the sea,
wide and without end.
The scale of it just overwhelmed us.
Somewhere out there in the distance,
at a time so far back, no man can even imagine it,
there was the beginning of all creation,
life itself was born!
- So what do you think? Like it?
- I like it, a lot.
- Is this water salty?
- What?
- Is the water salty?
- Try it and see.
Well? Is it the sea?
Too bad it's all so barren, so lifeless.
Look, over there!
Do you see that seaweed?
That's alive.
For now, it lives only in water, but when there are storms some of it will get thrown ashore.
Most will die, but some will survive.
Over time it'll get used to the air and the first plants will grow.
And one of them will turn into great forests!
Millions of years later!
Guys! I found something.
More life! Crustaceans.
There must be plenty more in the sea.
- That's where these come from.
- Let's look for more!
Guys, look what I got.
Do you see that?
- Jirka, you know what this is?
- No.
- A Trilobite!
- Really?
That is trilobite number two.
You found the one before, remember?
Yeah, let me see, what did I do with it?
Here it is!
So Jirka now had two trilobites in his hands.
Lying there side by side and yet so very far away from each other.
Between them lay
500 million years!
That stone was a piece of the history of our Earth.
Jirka finally understood, and that was it,
we'd reached the goal of our expedition, to show him the primeval world.
Neither he nor we will ever forget
what we have seen:
life, always changing, growing,
unstoppable,
like the waves on the seashore!
And so it will go on, never ending,
forever and ever...
This is Providence...
Providence, Rhode Island,
where we lived in the year 1921.
I was 16 then
and a sophomore in high school.
But enough about me,
for this is not my story...
but the story of our family
and, first and foremost...
the story of my father
and my mother.
Dad... Frank Bunker Gilbreth...
was an industrial engineer...
- and a leader in the field
of scientific management.
If that sounds complicated,
just say that he was an efficiency expert...
a man who'd shown industry
how to save time.
He was a man
of definite character...
and once his course was set,
nothing could swerve him.
Road hog!
Whenever he came home from a business trip...
- even if he'd been away only for a day,
He brought with him an element
of surprise and suspense.
For there's no doubt about it.
Dad was a rugged individualist...
Brilliant but... well, let's face it...
a trifle eccentric,
Living by a code
ofhis own design.
It's Daddy! It's Daddy!
Hello, live bait.
- Hello, Dad. Glad you're home.
- Glad to be home, Anne.
- Hi, Dad. I was over on the lot.
- Hmm. So I see.
Eighteen seconds. Not bad, not bad.
But I still say we should make it in less.
- We gotta keep trying.
- Hello, Frank.
- Hello, dear.
- How was your trip?
- Couldn't have been better.
- I'm glad, dear.
Hi, there, funny face.
Have any trouble with the offspring this time?
- No more than usual.
- How about this one?
- Oh, she's been good as gold.
- Hey, Dad... what did you bring us?
Quiet, quiet.
You'll find out later.
Fall in. Fall in.
Come on, there, small fry.
Mm-hmm.
Good boy, Jackie.
Dan.
You, there.
What's your name... Sitting Bull?
Aw, you haven't forgotten me, Daddy.
I'm Fred.
- Fred? Fred what?
- Fred Sittin Bull.
- How!
- How!
All right, let's see your nails.
Hmm, you could stand a little soap and water on those hands, young man.
Aw, heck, Dad. What's the good of always washing 'em? They only get dirty again.
That's a risk we have to take.
- Lillian, I thought I told you not to bite your nails.
- I didn't bite 'em, Daddy.
- They broke off on the piano.
- Then maybe you'd better go back to the violin.
- Oh-oh. How many home runs today?
- Two.
Slipping, huh?
All right, Martha.
Still dieting?
Kinda.
Very nice, Mary. Ernestine.
Mm-hmm.
What's that on your face? Paint?
No, it isn't. And besides, Dad, they don't call it paint anymore. It's makeup.
I don't care what they call it.
And don't think you can fool me, either.
I know paint when I see it.
Here. Spit on this.
Hm. Well, I see it isn't paint, and I apologize.
But it might have been. As I've told you,
I won't have any painted women in this house.
- If you start any of that nonsense, you'll find yourself...
- In a convent.
Yes, Daddy, I know... the one with the 12-foot wall, near Albany.
Don't be impertinent.
Now, you'll find the chocolate bars there in my briefcase. Fall out. Fall out.
- Well, Lillie, it's all settled.
- Is it, dear?
- Yes, ma'am... signed, sealed and ready for delivery.
- Good.
- What is? What is?
- What's ready for delivery, Dad?
- Shall I?
- They'll have to know sooner or later.
All right. Hey, small fry, how would you kids like to live in Montclair, New Jersey?
- Montclair?
- You mean leave Providence?
- I don't know how else you'd do it.
- Oh, but why? Why?
- Well, because it'd be nearer my work.
- But, gee, Dad.
- I'm shortstop on our team.
- And I'm pitcher.
There's plenty of time before school starts.
You can form a new team in Montclair.
But we don't wanna form a new team.
We wanna be on the one we're on.
- Who wants to live in Montclair?
- You promised when we moved here we could stay.
- Just when we were makir friends too.
- It's all right now, lady.
I got them marbles and the comb out, and I think most of the bird's nest.
- Anyway, it works just as good as ever.
- I'll send you a check.
- That's all right. Will you just sign here?
- Aw, Dad, please...
Be quiet, all of you!
- Stop this infernal howling.
- But, Dad...
- Stop it!
- All these kids yours, mister?
Or is this a picnic?
They're all mine, and believe me, it's no picnic.
- Aw, look...
- Silence!
After a few days of organized confusion...
we were packed
and ready to depart.
And I might add that
Ringling Brothers'Circus had nothing on us.
- Hurry up there, Frank.
- Get off my feet!
Be sure everything's out of the house before you leave, Jim.
Don't you worry, Mrs. Gilbreth.
We'll take care of everything.
Have a nice trip.
We'll see you Friday morning.
Yes, we'll meet the train.
Hey, Bill. Come on, there.
Hurry up.
- Come on. Foolish Carriage is getting restless.
- I'm comir, Dad.
Come on, Bill.
Make it snappy.
- Mercy Maud!
- Scared you, didn't I, son?
- Mercy Maud!
- I'll bet you jumped six and 9/10ths inches.
- Gee, Dad.
- It's all right, dear.
Teach you to keep your eyes open crossing streets, young man.
Well, is everybody in?
Anne, Ernestine, Martha, Mary, Frank...
- All present and accounted for, Dad.
- Okay.
If you're all reasonably sanitary, let's go.
Bye, Jim! Bye, Mrs. Monahan!
- Good-bye! Good-bye!
- Good-bye, Rhode Island.
New Jersey, here we come.
Hey, Noah, what are you doir with that ark?
Collecting animals like the good lord told me, brother.
All I need now is a jackass. Hop in!
- We turn to the left here, don't we, dear?
- I'm going to turn.
It's okay, Dad. I think you can make it.
I know I can make it. Hold out your hand.
- Hi, brother.
- Hi, brother.
Hi!
Eh, that fan belt again.
You have to get out, Bill.
- Excuse me, Lillie.
- It's not going to blow up, is it?
Of course not.
Wort take a minute to fix it.
Incidentally, now's a good time, while we're stopped, if any of you want to go see Mrs. Murphy.
- Well, how about it?
- Not me, Dad.
All right. But remember, all of you, this is your last chance.
Can't understand why a good car like this should keep acting up.
If it's not one thing, it's another.
Last week it was the carburetor.
- Who did that?
- Uh, that was a good joke on you, Dad.
Listen, young man... there's a time and a place for jokes, and a time and a place for spankings.
And the sooner you learn... Get out. Get out.
Mercy Maud, Frank. I'll bet you jumped six and 9/10ths inches that time.
Ha, you're right, son.
That was a good joke on me. By jingo,
I'll bet I did jump six and 9/10ths inches.
Oh, these kids. These kids.
Oh, excuse me, dear. I did that.
It was accidental.
#You made life cheery when you called me dearie #
# 'Twas down where the bluegrass grows #
#Your lips were sweeter than julep #
#When you wore a tulip #
- #And I wore a big, red rose #
- # Bom, bom ##
- Ah, Lillie, what do you suppose piddling little families...
- with only five or six children do with themselves?
- I can't imagine.
But I do know one thing.
We'll look back on moments like these as the happiest in our lives.
- You children hear that?
- Yes, sir.
All right.
Don't forget it.
- # Memories, memories #
- # Memories #
Dad. Hey, Dad.
- Yes, son?
- I gotta go see Mrs. Murphy.
- I asked you not 15 minutes ago, and you said that you...
- Yes, I know... but, gee, I can't help it, Dad.
- Me too, Dad.
- I do too, Dad.
By jingo, I gave you your last chance.
I'm not stopping again.
- But, Dad...
- Nothing doing. You had every opportunity.
Frank, I think you'd better stop.
All right. Out you go.
And hurry up.
We haven't got all day!
Make it snappy.
All right. You can open your eyes now.
Well, what do you think of it?
- Oh, Frank, it's beautiful.
- It's wonderful, Dad.
I'm glad you like it. Wait till you see the inside.
Come on. Let's get out.
Come on there, Frank. Help your mother.
That's a good fella.
- You must admit it's a mighty fine piece of property.
- It's lovely.
I knew it was the right place the minute I laid eyes on it.
I didn't say much or try to describe it.
I didn't want you to be disappointed.
- Oh, no, Daddy. We love it.
- Howdy. You folks moving in here?
- That's right. Gilbreth's the name.
- You certainly got a nice place.
- I'll say that for you.
- Thank you. We think so.
- All those kids yours?
- Oh, these aren't so many.
You ought to see the ones we left behind.
- How you ever feed 'em?
- Ah, they come cheaper by the dozen, you know.
Come on, kids.
 It was a wonderful house,
and we loved living in it...
but we soon found out that,
while it was often too small for 12 children...
it was more often too large
for two servants.
As usual, Mother and Dad met their problem
in the typical Gilbreth manner... head on!
The family council will please come to order.
Now, obviously, this house is too big for Mrs. Monahan and Jim Bracken... to take care of without help.
Therefore, your mother and I have called this meeting to discuss... you children taking over part of the work in the house and in the yard.
Assignments will be made on the basis of personal choice and aptitude.
Now, does the chair hear any suggestions?
Come, come, members of the council, this is a democracy. Everybody has an equal voice.
How do you want to divide the work?
In a democracy, everybody speaks.
So, by jingo, start speaking.
Bill, I recognize you.
What do you think?
I think Mrs. Monahan and Jim Bracken ought to do the work. They get paid for it.
- Sit down. You're no longer recognized.
- But in a democracy...
Hush, Bill.
It's almost impossible to get good servants... these days with so many children in the family.
- Mr. Chairman?
- Yes, son?
I think you're right. Jim and Mrs. Monahan do have too much to do.
- I move we hire more people to work for us.
- Second the motion!
- Me too.
- Out of order.
Sit down and be quiet, all of you.
I, uh... Uh,
The chair recognizes the assistant chairman.
Well, of course, we could hire additional help, and that might be the answer.
- But that would mean cutting the budget somewhere else.
Perhaps if we cut out all desserts...
and allowances,
we might be able to afford a maid.
And then if we cut out movies,
ice cream sodas and new clothes for a year... we might even be able to afford a helper forJim too.
Uh-huh. Do I hear a motion to that effect?
How about it, Bill?
You want to stop allowances? Frank? Anne?
Oh, well.
I move we allot the work.
- Splendid, splendid. Do I hear a second?
- Second the motion.
- All those in favor signify.
- Aye.
Motion carried.
Now, is there any further business?
I move we adjourn.
Not so fast, young lady. There's still that little matter of specific assignments.
For instance, the back fence, which is badly in need of whitewashing.
Do I hear any bids?
Huh? Speak up. If you want to earn a little extra spending money, here's your chance.
- Yes, Bill?
- I'll bid $10.
You must think this is a government project.
Do I hear any reasonable bids?
L... I bid 47 cents.
- Forty-seven cents?
- Please, Daddy. Let me do it.
- Tell me, how do you happen to hit on 47 cents?
- I've been saving to buy... a pair of roller skates, and that's how much more I need.
- But you're gonna get skates for your birthday.
- Frank.
Oh, I'm sorry, Lillie.
I wasrt supposed to let that out of the bag.
- Oh, Daddy, that's wonderful.
Thank you, thank you.
Besides, that's too big a job for a little girl like you.
Frank, here's your chance.
What do you bid... within reason?
Oh, well. 2.50, I guess.
Good. You got yourself a contract.
Now, is there any more new business?
I think this family ought to buy a dog.
Out of order. Meeting adjourned.
Well, here we are.
I know you're all eager to get started... on a new school year, so out you go.
- Hurry up. Hurry up.
- But, Dad, not all of us?
Certainly all of you.
You want us to make an impression, don't you?
But this isn't our school...
Ernestine's and mine.
- We're gonna go to high school.
- We'll take care of that later.
- I wanna show these people first what a real family looks like.
- But it's so embarrassing.
A person with inner dignity is never embarrassed.
Besides, visits like this get results.
Teachers lap it up.
I only wish I had time to send home for your mother and the babies.
- And I will, too, unless you two get a move-on. Come on.
- Honestly, Dad.
- You have more gall...
- Somebody in this family has to show a little spunk.
- Come on, son.
- It's so silly.
Ern! Ern! There he is.
He's the one I told you about... the captain of the swimming team. His name is Tom Black.
- Oh, he's adorable.
- I'll say.
What are you two hanging back there for?
Come along!
Shh! Daddy, please.
Why...
- Why, somebody might hear you.
- Suppose they do?
They're gonna hear from me soon enough anyhow.
No dying-cow looks, now.
Hold your heads up and look alive. Let's go.
Take your hats off.
Gangway.
Refer these to Miss Jensen.
Give these to Miss Sweeney.
Come in.
Good morning, madam.
Just a Gilbreth invasion, or perhaps I should say a partial invasion... since I left most of them at home with their mother.
- I hope we're not intruding.
- Oh, not at all.
I'm delighted to see you, Mr. Gilbreth.
We've heard so much about you.
I understand you have...
Eleven children, ma'am, but unfortunately... only five will be under your excellent supervision:
Mary, Martha, Lillian,
Bill and FrankJr.
- How do you do, sir?
- I just brought my two older girls,
Anne and Ernestine... along so you could get a better idea of the crop we're raising.
Well, I'm so glad you dropped in, Mr. Gilbreth.
I'm sure we're all going to get along beautifully together. It's such a pleasure...
Uh, just a minute.
I'm not just dropping in.
I want to meet their teachers and see what grades they're going into.
Oh, well, I'm afraid all our teachers are busy at the moment. You see, it's opening day...
Oh, that's all right.
I'm in no hurry.
In fact, I've arranged my schedule so as to give you my entire morning.
- You have?
- Meanwhile, as to their grades...
I see no reason why children who are well-developed mentally should be held back... by a school system geared to those of simply normal intelligence.
No. Of course not. But so much depends on their ages. Now, if you'll just...
You mean mental ages, of course.
- Bill, how old are you, son?
- Eight.
What grade does an eight-year-old usually belong in?
- The third.
- Then I think he'd better go in the fifth.
Oh-ho, but that's impossible, Mr. Gilbreth.
Perhaps later on, if he takes tests...
By all means. I hope they'll all take a lot of tests. It's good for them.
Meanwhile to, uh, to illustrate my point... Frank... what's 46 times 83?
Three thousand, eight hundred and eighteen.
Lillian, 19 times 91.
 One thousand,
seven hundred and twenty-nine.
Bill, 52 times 52.
Two thousand, seven hundred and four.
Now, would you care to suggest a few large numbers?
Well, I... think I'll take your word for it, Mr. Gilbreth... and I'll see what I can do.
It would really expedite matters... if you'd have the teacher of the fifth grade step in here for a moment.
Also, while we're about it... the teachers of the third, fourth, sixth and seventh.
Ask Miss Billsop, Miss Jensen,
Miss Moore, Mrs. Hallbright... and Miss Sweeney to step in here for a moment.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you, madam.
And now, while we're waiting... perhaps it might interest you to hear something of the home training program... their mother and I have worked out for the children:
Spelling games, geography quizzes, language study...
We're learning French and German from a Victrola.
Dad's even taught us how to take a whole bath in the time it takes to play just one record.
- Really?
A simple matter of coordination, madam.
Like any other physical effort, scientific bathing is...
- Yes, but how do you do it?
- Well, this seems hardly the time and place.
I doubt if you'd be interested.
Oh, but I am.
It sounds perfectly fascinating.
- Yeah. Go on. Show her, Dad.
- Yeah. Show her.
- Here.
- Well, if you insist, son.
This is really very simple.
First, you take the soap in your right hand, apply it to the left shoulder... run it down the top of the left arm, up the inside of the left arm to the armpit...
then the ears... both of them, of course...
not forgetting the back of the neck... then down the outside of the left leg, back up the inside of the left leg... then down the right leg, and up.
Then at the hip, change the soap to the left hand...
and do the same thing
on the right arm and shoulder.
After a couple of circular motions
on the midsection and back... and some special attention to the feet... slide under for a rinse, and you rise bathed.
Oh, come in, ladies. Mr. Gilbreth is just showing me how to take a bath.
- A what?
- Good morning, ladies.
Good morning.
In our family, sickness was taboo.
Dr. Burtors car in front of our house
could mean only one thing.
- Dad!
- Yes?
- Where's the baby? Where is it?
- In her room taking her nap, of course. Why?
- We mean the latest model.
- Is it a boy or a girl?
Is what a boy or a girl?
Aw, come on, Daddy. You can't fool us.
What are we gonna name this one?
Lillie, what's got into these children?
What are they talking about?
- I can't imagine, dear.
- We wanna see the new baby.
Whatever gave you the idea there was a new baby?
- That's Dr. Burtors automobile outside, isn't it?
- Yes.
- And you were sick last night, werert ya?
- I had a slight headache.
And every time you're sick there's always a baby, isn't there?
Oh, my goodness. Babies don't come just because you're sick. I thought you knew that.
They've always come before when you were sick.
Oh, dear.
It's up to you, Lillie. You're the psychologist.
I have some very important work to do.
I'll be in my study.
You understand, don't you?
Yes, I certainly do.
Well, first, about Dr. Burton.
He's here because he's afraid Jack has a whooping cough, which means you children... will have to stay away from him.
As to babies, well,
I think it's about time we had a little talk.
Oh, no, Bill.
Don't tell me you're getting it too?
- Who's that coughing?
- Me, Dad.
Well, stop it.
I'm not gonna have an epidemic in this house.
We haven't time for any such nonsense.
You children have been given good health, and by jingo, it's your job to keep it.
- I don't want any excuses. You hear me?
- Yes, sir.
- All right.
- I think I better get him up to the doctor.
Yes, Lillie.
Where did that whatever-it-is come from?
- He's a beaut, isn't he, Dad?
- A beaut?
Look here, you mangy mongrel...
Go on. Get out.
Don't argue. Out! Out!
Martha, keep that cover on.
Remember what the doctor said.
- He wants you to keep warm.
- Yes, Mother.
Here, darling.
Put this jacket around your shoulders.
Oh, thank you, Mother.
 I'm going down to the kitchen
now to get your dessert... and I'll read to you, if you like.
- Oh, hello, Dad.
- May I come in?
- Of course, dear.
- I won't disturb anything.
It's all right.
The children have missed you.
- Oh, Frank. Not you too?
- Yes, yes. Looks like I belong up here too, Lillie.
Oh, dear.
Daddy's got the whooping cough.
- Daddy's got the whooping cough.
- You children get back in bed. Go on.
- Dr. Burton...
- Yes?
- Will you come in here a minute, please?
- Right away.
Frank, sit down, dear.
- Do you ache anywhere?
- I'll be all right, Lillie.
- In heavers name, what's the trouble now?
- It's Mr. Gilbreth.
He's coughing too.
Oh, me. How did I ever get mixed up with this family anyhow?
Let me hear you cough.
There's nothir the matter with me.
- I was only joking.
- You were what?
Well, it just wasrt any fun downstairs by myself, Lillie.
- I wanted to be up here with the rest of the family.
- Very funny. Very funny.
Frank Gilbreth, I give up. Sometimes I think you're more trouble than the children.
I'm sorry, Lillie. But all that quiet down there makes me nervous.
Oh, really.
Tell me, Doc, how are my Mongolians coming along?
- They'll live.
- In spite of you, you old veterinarian.
Well, I'll say one thing for you, Gilbreth.
Your children don't get sick very often... but when they do, they certainly mess up... the public health statistics of the state of New Jersey.
- How's that, Mr. Bones?
- Ordinarily, I only have a couple of cases of whooping cough... or measles a week, but when I have to report
11 cases in a single day, they're liable... to quarantine the whole town of Montclair and close every school in Essex county.
Well, at least these are only light cases.
Pioneer stock, you know.
As far as New Jersey's concerned, whooping cough's whooping cough.
By the way, these kids have got tonsils... really ugly ones.
- As soon as they're over this, they ought to come out.
- I've never had mine out.
- Maybe you should. Let's look.
- No, you don't.
There's nothing the matter with them.
- Oh, stop wasting my time and sit down.
- What's the point of all this?
Open your mouth.
Open your mouth.
- Say "ah."
- Ah-h-h-h.
Just as I thought.
Yours should have been out years ago.
- You're crazy.
I've never been sick a day in my life.
- Let them stay in if you want to.
You're not hurting anyone but yourself.
But these children's tonsils have got to come out, all but one... Martha's.
- Hers are as sound as a dollar.
- Hooray for me.
- Well, good night, girls. I'll see you tomorrow.
- Good night, Doctor.
Say, Doc, I was just thinking.
If we have to have their tonsils out, could we do it here in the house?
- Why here?
What's the matter with a hospital?
- Well, it struck me... if we could rig up an operating room downstairs,
I could photograph the operations... and study what you doctors are doing wrong.
Then I'd be able to show how you could eliminate a lot of waste motions and speed things up.
Now, wait a minute. That system of yours may be all right in factories...
And in medicine too.
Ho-ho, I've been looking for a chance like this.
- Now, not so fast. Nobody's going to...
- Oh, you're leaving, Doctor?
- Lillie, we're gonna have the children's tonsils out.
- Oh, Frank, do we have to?
That's what this fella here says.
But it's all right. I'm gonna take movies.
- Of the operations?
- Certainly, of the operations.
Why, there's no telling how many lives this sort of study will help save.
But doesn't it seem rather heartless, using the children as guinea pigs?
Not at all. They'll be asleep and won't know what's going on.
Besides, if it'll make you feel any better,
I'll let this old butcher here yank mine out too.
Yours? Well, why didn't you say so?
Now we're getting somewhere.
- Oh, Frank...
- No, don't stop him.
Let him go ahead and cut his own throat.
That's one part of the festivities
I might even enjoy.
Will you stop drooling?
By jingo, this may make you famous, you ol' quack.
All right, May, you can ease up a little now.
- All right. Start...
Start cranking.
Can you see it all?
Is the clock in?
 Yeah, it's in.
Everything's in.
Mr. Gilbreth, my stomach's beginning to...
I'm not interested in your internal organs.
Just keep cranking.
Dad had said, "Think of all the fun we'll have...
looking at the movies
and seeing ourselves asleep. "
But I'm afraid, to those waiting,
it was not a very consoling thought.
As much as they loved movies,
I have a feeling that that's one epic...
they'd have been
delighted to pass up.
I hear you poor kids couldn't have any breakfast this morning.
Aw, everybody knows you can't eat before you get operated on.
I had doughnuts for breakfast with sugar... mmm, delicious...
and a big piece of apple pie
that was left over from last night.
You beast.
You get out of here.
Mrs. Monahan was just as sweet as she could be.
"Why don't you have another one, Martha?"
"Thanks, Mrs. Monahan,
I believe I will."
"Why don't you take two to three, dear?
They're so tasty."
"I really shouldn't,
Mrs. Monahan.
"But maybe while those poor kids
are waiting tonight...
I'll dedicate one to each of them."
Mother, will you make Martha stop talking...
about what a delicious
breakfast she had?
All she's done
since she's been in here is gloat.
- Not another word about food, Martha.
Do you understand?
- I'm sorry, Mother.
I won't even mention doughnuts and apple pie again.
- Martha!
- Nothing to it.
Anne slept through it just like a baby.
And I know we got some great movies.
Come on, Ernestine, girl. You're next.
- Don't be afraid, dear.
It'll be over in a few minutes.
- I'm not afraid, Mother, much.
A Gilbreth, afraid? Don't be ridiculous.
After all, she's her father's daughter.
What in the world is there to be afraid of?
Never heard such nonsense.
- This'll all be over in a jiffy. Go on, dear.
- Go ahead, dear.
- That's a good girl.
- I'll go up with Anne.
Everything's under control.
Let's take off the robe and hop right up here on the table.
- Is it going to hurt?
- At your age, you won't even feel it.
That's what
I told her, Doctor.
All right, May.
Just relax, dear. I'll be right here with you.
How about changing the lens for this one?
I want to see exactly how his caddy hands him those knives.
But ain't it kinda hot in here?
Couldn't we open a widow or somethir?
- Do you want this child to get pneumonia?
- But this ether...
- Never mind the ether.
Just take care of that camera.
- Ready, Doctor.
Good heavens, man, I told you
I didn't want Martha.
- You haven't got Martha. That's Ernestine.
- You sure?
- Of course I'm sure, you jackass.
- You must be mistaken.
Here. Look carefully.
There now. Isn't that Martha?
Don't you suppose I know my own children?
I tell you, that's Ernestine.
- Well, if this isn't Martha, we've made a horrible mistake.
- We? What do you mean, we?
- What kind of a mistake?
- I know them by their tonsils.
I thought these were Martha's.
They're the only ones that didn't have to come out.
- You mean you knocked my little girl unconscious for no reason?
- I'm sorry, but that's about it.
I'll admit it was careless, but you do have an uncommon lot of them...
- and they all look alike to me.
- But what do we do now?
Take them out anyhow.
They may have to come out eventually.
The worst part of an operation is dreading it beforehand.
- Go get Martha ready.
- But she's been eating all morning.
Never mind. Go get her.
I'm not going through another day like this.
- Start grinding.
At least we'll salvage something.
 Poor Martha.
It was a blow, but in she went
full of pie, doughnuts and indignation.
Frank.
- What is all this about Martha?
- This fool, Burton... he got her mixed up with Ernestine.
- It's all his fault.
- I don't care whose fault it is.
I think it's a shame... after letting that poor child eat all those doughnuts for breakfast... only to be snatched up and brought in to be butchered.
Now, there's nothing to worry about, Lillie.
It's no worse than a mosquito bite.
Besides, it's almost over. You better wait in the other room. Go on, dear.
There we are.
Keep grinding.
Frank, I think this whole thing...
But you're making a mountain out of a molehill.
All it takes is the tiniest little cut at the back of the throat.
Just to show you it's nothing,
I'll go next.
- I thought you wanted to watch your pictures.
- Oh, I'll watch, all right.
I'm only gonna take a local anesthetic.
Ho-ho, I won't miss a thing.
- But does Dr. Burton think a local anesthetic is wise?
- That's just a lot of nonsense... about my physical condition.
These doctors don't know what they're talking about half the time.
I'll be in the amen corner when they're laying him away.
Besides, I wanna get this over with before lunch. I'm starved.
Gee, Dad, you act like you're lookir forward to it.
Why, sure, son. There's nothing to it.
Huh! Just like rollir off a log.
All right, who's next?
- I am.
- Okay, make it snappy.
A man can stand just so much.
Frank, I hope you're not making a mistake.
After all, at your age...
Age has nothing to do with it, Lillie.
It's simply a matter of resolution.
Let's go.
Yes, indeed.
To Dad, a tonsil operation was nothing,
just like... how did he put it?
"Just like rolling off a log."
- Frank!
- Oh, Lillie.
- My throat. This is awful.
- Yes. I know, dear.
- I... I can't talk.
- Nurse, I'll take him.
You're all right, old pioneer.
- You just had to have it the hard way, that's all.
- Lillie, I...
- I'm dying.
- Now, come on, old-timer.
I'll give you something to make you sleep.
How am I gonna sleep with my throat cut?
- You'll be all right in a couple of weeks.
- Mr. Gilbreth! Mr. Gilbreth!
Go away. Go away. Can't you see I'm dying?
I hate to tell you this, but it looks like none of them motion pictures'll be any good.
- No good?
- Uh, I forgot to put any film in the camera.
- You what?
- Please. Oh, now, please, please
don't get excited.
- Anyhow, it's too much for me. I quit!
- Let me at him.
- Frank!
- Let me at him!
- Children, children.
Now, we are not doing our best.
Suppose we start over, and this time, let's be sure everybody's in the same key.
Oh, it's no use,
Miss Ethel.
We might as well face it.
We just haven't any musical talent.
We mustrt let our father hear us say that.
- Why? Doesrt he know yet?
- He takes it for granted that all of his children are gifted.
Well, far be it for me to disillusion him.
- Let's go.
- All right, children? Ready?
One, two, three...
Softly, now. Softly as a little brook tinkling through a still forest.
Excuse me, but do you by any chance hear a little brook... tinkling through a still forest?
Poor Miss Ethel. What fortitude.
You're home early, dear.
Yes, I know.
Well, I had a letter today... from Dr. Bleneim of Czechoslovakia.
- Thought you might like to see it.
- Oh, do they want you to come?
Well, there's nothing really definite yet, but Bleneim thinks there's a good chance... they'll ask me to speak at the International
Management Conference in Prague.
Oh, Frank, I knew they would.
May I see it?
Let's not count our chickens too soon.
This is gonna be a pretty high-powered meeting.
It'll attract the best scientific minds in the world.
That's why it's such a wonderful opportunity to show other countries... what motion study really is and have your methods accepted universally.
I admit it's what
I've always hoped for.
It might mean a great deal financially too, Lillie.
But the important thing is that it will establish you as a leader in the whole field.
- I'm so happy, Frank.
- I knew you'd be pleased. And why not?
After all, if it hadn't been for you and your help...
- Will you tell the children tonight?
- You can tell them if you want... but warn them... not a word about it yet.
- But I won't be here tonight.
- You won't be here? Where are you going?
- Have you forgotten?
I have a date at the hospital.
- So soon?
Yes, dear, I'm afraid so.
But I thought you were only joking about going to the hospital.
After all, you never went to one before just to have a baby.
Maybe I never thought about it before.
Going to be awfully lonely around here without you, Lillie.
I'll hurry back
as quickly as I can.
By the way, do you mind what it is?
Why, I thought we'd already agreed it would be a boy. After all, we have six girls.
But of course, anything you decide will be all right with me.
Thank you, dear.
Have you thought of a name?
- Why, no, I haven't.
- What do you think of Robert?
Robert? Why Robert?
Who's named Robert?
Oh, no one in particular.
It's just a nice name, that's all.
I always knew you had a strange collection of beaus during your college years... but, uh, which one was Robert?
The one with the long hair and the violin, or the one that lisped... like "thith"?
When you're quite through, we'll decide on a name.
In the meantime, if you want to go into the subject of old flames... remember... two can play at that game.
- I seem to recall a certain lady poetess...
- Never mind. Never mind.
I wouldn't think of blighting an old schoolgirl romance.
Male or female,
Robert it is.
 For the 12th time,
Dad's verdict was exactly the same.
Well, I'll say this for him.
He's every inch a Gilbreth.
- I'm glad you approve.
- Yes. I expect we'd better keep him too.
Well, Lillie, it's over. Twelve of'em.
And hardly an idiot in the bunch.
And you were afraid you'd be the last of the Gilbreths.
I admit, you had me worried there for a while.
Four girls in a row.
That can be pretty nerve-racking.
Of course, you know
I did it deliberately.
Come here, young fella.
Let's you and me get acquainted.
Be careful with him, Frank.
I don't think hospitals approve of fathers.
Hospitals. Heh.
Young man, did I ever tell you about the night your mother and I were married... and we decided to have an even dozen like you, hmm?
You set the actual target, dear... six boys and six girls.
I believe you even made a memorandum of it.
That's right, son.
Sounds kind of silly now, doesn't it?
Not half as silly as it sounded then.
Honestly, dear, did you really think we'd be able to go through with it?
Why, certainly.
I always knew that anything you and I teamed up on, Lillie, would be a success.
It'll seem kind of funny, won't it?
For the first time in 17 years... we'll be able to go to bed without setting the alarm for a 2:00 feeding.
It's certainly gonna be a luxury, isn't it?
A wonderful luxury... and I'll hate it.
- Well, Bob, you better get back to your mother.
Looking after her is gonna be one of your jobs from now on.
And incidentally, young man, she's a pretty wonderful woman.
Anyway, that's one mars opinion.
That's good. Smile, now.
Smile so I can see
the whites of your teeth.
And stop fidgeting. How can I focus this thing
if you keep on fidgeting?
Children, please be quiet.
This won't last much longer.
Anne, you're the oldest.
Help your mother keep them quiet.
I'm afraid that would require an act of God.
Now, stop moving for all our sakes and smile.
That's right. Now, listen to your sister.
Come on, now. Let's have a great big smile.
Come on. Smile for Daddy.
That's better.
Are we all ready?
Jane, take your hands down from your ears.
That's a good girl.
Now, then, here we go.
Hold it. Hold it.
Ho-o-old it!
I think that was a good one, Lillie.
Ha-ha, this new flash certainly works fine.
Yes, it certainly does.
- Now that we're all together, whadaya say?
- Yeah, it's a swell time.
You get the chair and the gavel, and I'll get the table.
- Okay.
- Thank you, dear.
- Come, children. It's past your bedtime.
- Before you go upstairs, Lillie... don't you think we ought to take one more, just to be on the safe side?
- I think not, dear.
- Why, after all, we should.
- It's the first time we've had all 12 together.
- No, Frank.
- Seven explosions are quite enough in one night.
- Okay, Lillie. You're the boss.
- Well, what's that for?
- Dad, we've been talkir something over... and we wondered, as long as we're all here, if we couldn't have a family council.
Well, that's possible.
What's on your mind, son?
- We want to do it legally, Dad, in regular meeting.
- Very good.
All right, everybody.
Come on. Let's take seats.
- No, Frank. I have to get the babies to bed.
- This won't take long.
- After all, if the children are interested...
- I'll take them up, Mother.
I, uh... I think they want you down here.
- All right, dear. But what's all mystery about?
- You'll find out. Come, Jane.
All right, kids, take your places.
I'll be at your service in a moment.
Hurry up, there. Make it snappy.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Now, then, are we all settled?
Now, the, uh... the family council will please come to order.
Now, then, what's the problem?
- Mr. Chairman?
- Yes?
It's been brought to our attention that the assistant chairman... Mother... intends to buy a new rug for the dining room.
And since the entire membership will be required to look upon and sit in chairs... resting on said rug, we move that the council be consulted before any rug is purchased.
- Second the motion.
- Me too!
That's a point well taken.
Any discussion?
We'd like to ask the assistant chairman how much it's going to cost.
- Mr. Chairman, I move that not more than $95 be spent.
- Second the motion.
- Me too.
Well, this idea of saving five dollars is a very laudable one. Let me commend you.
Now, all those in favor of spending only $95 for a rug signify by saying "aye."
- Aye!
- Carried. Now, is there any further business?
Yes, sir, Mr. Chairman. I move we spend the five dollars we've just saved to buy a dog.
- Second the motion.
- Out of order. Out of order.
Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You children know very well how I feel about having animals around here.
- But, Mr. Chairman, a dog would be a pet.
- William...
Everyone in the family could pat him and I would be his master.
A dog would be a friend, Mr. Chairman.
He could eat scraps of food, and...
- Save motions.
- What was that?
And that would save motions for the garbage man.
A dog would keep burglars away.
He would sleep on the foot of my bed... and I would wash him whenever he was dirty.
A dog would be an accursed nuisance, that's what he'd be.
He'd be our master.
He'd eat us out of house and home.
He'd spread fleas from the garret to the basement.
And he'd attach himself to me.
Ho, they always do. And I won't have it.
- But, Mr. Chairman, I promise...
- No.
No filthy, flea-bitten creature's gonna share my bed and board.
- This whole idea is ridiculous.
- But, Mr. Chairman, I...
Lillie, don't you see where this is leading us?
If we start throwing our money away like this, the next thing they'll want is... ponies, roadsters, trips to Hawaii.
You tell 'em it's out of the question.
I think, dear, we can rely on the good sense of the children.
- After all, a five-dollar dog is not a trip to Hawaii.
- But, Lillie...
- Question.
- Vote! Vote! Vote!
No, no! This whole thing's out of order.
If I'd known what you were up to, I'd...
- Vote! Vote! Vote!
- All those in favor...
- Aye!
- Ayes have it!
No. No. I still say no. No!
- The ayes have it, dear.
- But, Lillie...
The meeting's adjourned.
A dog.
Mmm.
Dad was right.
There were 14 Gilbreths
in the house, but Mr. Chairman...
for thus was he christened... soon dispelled all
doubt as to which Gilbreth was his favorite.
In no time at all,
they were bosom companions.
- There was no end
to Dad's determination to save time.
- Ready? Go.
And in these experiments, large or small,
Mother was always at his side...
a partner in every enterprise.
- Stop. How long was that?
- Seven seconds.
Good. Now we'll do it the other way.
- Ready?
- Go.
That was better... only five and a half seconds.
- By jingo, I knew it.
Bottom to top, that's the answer.
 Along with Dad's,
Mother's fame as a psychologist...
and industrial consultant had grown also...
To such an extent that people came
from far and wide to solicit her help.
- Mrs. Gilbreth?
- Yes?
I'm Amelia Mebane.
I wonder if I could talk with you for a moment.
I'm very busy. If...
If you could tell me...
- Well, I'll only take a moment of your time.
- Well, won't you come in?
Thank you.
- In here, please.
- I understand you're very civic-minded,
Mrs. Gilbreth.
I believe in being a good citizen, yes.
- Wort you sit down?
- Thank you.
- You lecture too, I hear.
- Occasionally.
- Now, just what is it you wanted to...
- Well, it's...
It's about birth control.
Birth control?
Yes. The National League of Planned Parenthood... is organizing a local chapter in Montclair.
- I was told that you'd be interested.
- I?
I met a friend of yours on the train last night... a next-door neighbor, I believe.
She felt that you were just the person we're looking for.
She was sure you'd be willing to cooperate.
Well, just how would you want me to cooperate?
Why, by being the moving spirit behind our Montclair chapter.
That's a pretty big job, isn't it?
Oh, yes.
Yes, there's work to be done.
That's why I'm appealing to you... a civic-minded career woman with a... and this is most important... with a large house where one can hold meetings.
Well, of course,
I'll have to consult my husband.
Oh, is he interested in good works too?
Oh, yes. I think he'll be very interested in this.
- Excuse me. I'll call him.
- Certainly.
- Can you come into the living room a moment, dear?
- I'm awfully busy, Lillie.
But we have a guest, dear.
A lady from New York... who wants me to be the head of the local birth control organization.
Of the what?
Shh.
It's a pretty big job, dear.
Oh, indeed.
Well, in that case, Lillie, let's go.
Mrs. Mebane, this is my husband, Mr. Gilbreth.
- How do you do, Mr. Gilbreth?
- A pleasure, madam.
It's a great pleasure to meet a woman engaged in such a noble cause.
Thank you. And it's a pleasure to find a man who thinks it is noble.
Usually we find the husbands so much less sympathetic with our aims than the wives.
You'd be surprised at some of the horrible things men have said to me.
- Yes, I can imagine.
- And yet, if you could see, as I have... relatively young women growing old before their times.
Ah, a pity.
A great pity.
- Excuse me, Mrs. Mebane, just a moment.
- Why, of course.
- Why, how odd.
What's he doing, Mrs. Gilbreth?
- Whistling.
- Oh, yes, I know.
- But why?
- Oh, he frequently whistles.
- Uh...
- Gangway!
- Come on, Jackie.
- Hurry up, there. Pick up your feet.
Make it snappy. Where's Frank?
He's always late. Come here, Frank.
- Now, then. Are we all assembled?
- Yeah.
Fourteen seconds. By jingo, I knew you could do it. It's a new world's record.
- What is it?
- Yeah, what'd you call us for?
I want you to meet a very important lady.
Now, come with me, children.
Watch your manners.
Children, this is Mrs. Mebane.
How do you do? How do you do? Hello. Hello.
- I... don't quite understand. Is this a school?
- No, it isn't a school.
Then it's... No. Oh, no.
Yes, they are.
- They are what, madam?
- They're yours. Don't try to deny it.
I shouldn't think of denying it, madam.
Let me introduce the family, at least most of it.
- Seems to me there should be some more of them around here.
- Heaven help us.
Lillie, how many head of children have we now, would you say offhand?
Well, the last time I counted them, dear, there seemed to be an even dozen.
- A dozen?
- I may have missed one or two, but not many.
I'd say twelve was a pretty fair guess.
- Disgusting. And within 18 miles of national headquarters too.
- Tsk, tsk, tsk.
- Shall we have some tea?
- Certainly not. Good day.
- Good day, madam.
- Good day.
It looks to me as though somebody's been pulling my leg!
- How revolting.
- And within 18 miles of national headquarters too.
Our summers, we spent at Nantucket...
in a cottage
and two abandoned lighthouses.
Dad had named it "The Shoe"
in honor of Mother...
who, he said, reminded him
of the old woman who lived in one.
Come on, slowpokes.
Last one in is Kaiser Bill.
There you go, young lady.
You boys look out after her.
Come along, Anne, Ernestine.
There's nothing you can do about it.
You know how your father feels about the primitive life.
- Now, be good, children.
- We will.
You'd think Dad invented this ocean.
Andy.
Look. Is that Tom Black?
It certainly looks like him.
It is.
He's the lifeguard.
Oh, I can't imagine what he's doing here.
Well, he has to keep in condition for swimming somewhere, doesn't he?
Oh, yes. But here... in Nantucket.
Leave your towels here, children.
Air.
- Wonderful air. Ho-ho.
- Oh, now, Frank, please don't overdo it.
- You know what Dr. Burton said.
- That quack? He can't scare me.
My heart's as good as his any day. Better.
But this water's always cold.
It's a shock.
A good dip in the ocean never hurt anybody.
Hurry up. Get your robe off.
- Let's go, kids.
- Come on, girls.
- The sooner we get this over with, the better.
- You go on ahead, Mother.
- We'll be in in just a few minutes.
- All right. But don't be long.
We won't.
- Why don't we stroll by and speak to him?
- Why should we?
Well, after all, we see him at school, don't we?
Yes. We see him, but he doesn't even know I... we exist.
Flaming youth. Heh. Look at them!
Fine spectacle:
Bobbed hair, rolled stockings, painted knees.
I don't know what's coming over girls today.
Don't they know what's going to happen to them if they go around looking likeJezebels?
- Frank, that word's "Eskimo."
- "Jezebels" I said, and "Jezebels" I mean.
But that's the way everybody dresses today.
Everybody but Ernestine and me.
Why, we're... we're freaks.
Freaks or not, you're not going around with bare knees... for all the boys to ogle... not while I'm alive.
- Boys don't ogle when everybody dresses that way.
- Don't tell me what boys ogle.
I was young once myself. And I'd hate to tell you what would have happened in my day... if girls had dressed like some of these girls do today.
- What?
- Never you mind what.
But, Mother, what's wrong with the way girls dress today?
- Is it a crime to try to look as attractive as you can?
- That isn't the point, dear.
Men... that is, nice men... don't want to marry girls who make themselves cheap.
They may run around with them before they're married... but when they settle down, they want someone they can respect.
Well, they certainly respect me.
I'm the most respected girl I know.
- Why, they respect me so much, they won't even look at me.
- Me either.
- That's too bad.
- Honestly, Dad, how do you expect us to ever be popular?
Popular! Popular!
That's all I hear.
That's the magic word, isn't it?
That's what's the matter with this generation.
Nobody thinks about being smart or clever.
Huh. No, sir.
They just want to be pop-ular!
- Huh.
- But, Dad, if you'd only be reasonable.
For the last time, no.
I'll not have any fancy women in my family.
If other people want to go to the devil, that's their business.
But you're not going with them.
Is that clear?
It oughta be.
We've heard it often enough.
Otherwise you'll find yourself right in that convent... the one with the 12-foot wall.
Mother, what are we gonna do?
Go back and have your swim, dear.
I'll talk to your father.
- Oh, but, Mother, you...
- I know, dear. I understand.
- Now, you girls run along.
- I don't feel like going in, Mother.
- I'll help you with the table.
- All right, dear.
I want it back. You said I could have it.
- Give it to me!
- No, you don't.
Come on and catch me, if you want it.
- But it's my turn to play with that ball.
- If you want it, get it.
- Andy, button me, will you, please?
- "Button me."
That's all I hear from morning till night.
It's, "Andy, button me up," or "Andy, unbutton me."
- Aw, you're not mad.
- No, but I'm fed up.
Honestly, won't you ever learn to button yourself?
You're pretty when you're mad.
Oh, you little dickens. Go on. Get outta here.
Look out, convent. Here I come.
And I mean the one with the 12-foot wall.
- What have you done now?
- Nothing. It's what I'm about to do.
And I want you to know
I'm not doing this just for myself.
I'm doing it for you and Martha and Mary and Lillian and Jane...
'cause I know you'll never be emancipated until I pave the way.
What are you talking about?
Oh, Anne, you're not.
I've got to, otherwise we'll all go to our graves old maids... still wearing cootie garages over our ears and long drawers.
- Oh, but Dad'll murder you.
- You'll back me up, won't you?
Of course I will.
But who's gonna back Dad up?
Someone's got to take a stand somewhere... and I've made up my mind...
I'm going to.
- Oh, but, Anne...
- There!
Oh, no.
- What is it, Dad?
- Whatcha got?
Now, hold your horses. Keep your shirts on.
You remember I promised you children... there'd be no formal studying this summer... no language lessons or schoolbooks.
But I've discovered a way to teach you the Morse code without studying.
- Oh, Dad, do we have to?
- Not if you don't want to.
But those who don't are gonna be sorry.
Yes, indeedy.
I've painted the code on the bathroom wall... the one that faces you.
Now, you don't have to make a project of studying it, but, uh... you'll be surprised how much you'll absorb each day when...
- Who's that?
- It's a telegram. I'll get it.
It's all right, Frank. It's probably for me.
I'll go. Hold that.
- Let me see it.
- I will. Just a minute.
- Does it work?
- Of course it works.
- Martha, will you call
Anne and Ernestine, please?
- Yes'm.
There we are. Thank you, Jed.
- 'Twas no bother. How's the family?
- Oh, couldn't be better.
Good. Glad to see you back, Mr. Gilbreth.
- Thank you very much.
- Be seeing you.
Right.
Don't poke it so hard.
Get down, Fred.
You want to break it?
- What is it, dear?
- A cable from Bleneim in Prague.
It seems the management conference program is filled without me.
- Oh, Frank, really?
- Bleneim says he's still working... but for me not to count on it.
He's trying to let me down easy, but I gather there's a general lack of interest.
I'm sorry, dear. But don't be too disappointed.
There'll be other conferences.
I suppose I was counting on it too much, Lillie, but...
Well, no use crying over spilt milk.
- You go ahead with dinner. I'll be right in.
- All right, dear.
Hey, see what you've done?
It's just a screw. Here, I'll fix it.
You better
before Daddy sees it.
There.
Now it's all right.
- Let me work it.
- Wait a minute!
Leave that alone, now, children. Sit down.
Come along.
I'll take those,
Mrs. Monahan.
- Where's Anne?
- She's coming up, Mother.
Come along, dear.
We're rea...
Anne, what have you done?
- Look at yourself.
- Oh, I have looked at myself, Mother.
Please don't ask me to look again.
I don't want to spoil my appetite.
- But your hair. Your beautiful hair.
- What's the matter with her hair?
Take that ridiculous wig off.
- It's not a wig. I've cut my hair.
- You've what?
You can kill me if you want to, but I've done it.
I think it looks snaky.
Besides, it's more efficient.
- I'll bet she can fix her hair now in 15 seconds.
- Fix what hair?
- She hasn't any hair left to fix.
- Anne, how could you do this to yourself?
Herself? How could she do it to an Airedale?
Well, I won't have it.
I want it grown back fast.
I'm not gonna grow it back. I don't care what you say. I'm sick of being a freak!
- Anne, come back here. Anne?
- Let her go, dear.
After all, it isn't such a tragedy.
- All the girls her age are bobbing their hair now.
- But I distinctly told her...
But you forget. She's growing up.
She's no longer a child.
She has to make some decisions for herself.
- Nevertheless, I'm not gonna have her defying me...
- Please, come and have dinner.
I'll talk to her after we've had time to think this over.
- But, Lillie, if we start letting the children do as they please...
- Please, dear, for my sake.
Well, all right, Lillie, but...
By the time vacation was over...
and we were on our way
back to Montclair...
Dad was reconciled.
My bobbed hair had been a bitter pill
for him to swallow...
but like all fathers
from the beginning of time...
he gulped and swallowed it.
- What's that?
- Oh. Hello, Daddy. Come on in.
You might as well know the worst. I...
I bought these with my own money and I'm going to wear them.
Oh, no, you're not. You're gonna take them back where you got them.
- They embarrass me even to look at them.
- Oh, but, Dad...
Do you mean to tell me this is all the underwear women put on nowadays?
But they don't show.
Besides, Dad, everybody wears them now.
If you don't believe me, you can come and see for yourself.
That won't be necessary.
Oh, Daddy, please be sensible. You...
You don't really mean I have to take them back? Not really, do you, Dad?
- Do you?
- Well, all right.
But no silk stockings and high-heeled shoes.
I'm not gonna have a lot of doctor bills because of foot trouble.
Thank you, Dad.
And while we're both in the mood... you might as well know it's a little late for that now.
I've been wearing them ever since we came home from Nantucket.
- Now, Anne...
- Andy! Andy, telephone!
- It's a boy calling!
- A boy? Excuse me, Dad!
Come back here.
I'm not saying you can wear those things.
- Better hurry up before he gets away.
- Who do you suppose it is?
- Yeah, who could be calling you?
- Shut up.
Hello.
Oh, hello, Joe.
Fine, thank you.
What? Oh, I'd love to.
You will?
8:00? Oh, that would be simply wonderful.
Thank you for calling.
Good-bye.
You see, Dad? I told you if I started dressing like the other girls...
- everything would be all right.
- Who was it, dear?
Joe Scales. He's asked me to the senior prom Friday night.
- It's the dance of the year.
- Why, how lovely, dear. I'm so glad.
Who's Joe Scales?
Is he nice?
Well, he comes from an awfully nice family, and he's a cheerleader.
- He's got his own car too.
- Two fine recommendations.
What about a raccoon coat?
- Oh, he'll probably get that next year when he goes to college.
- Gee!
Come on. I've got to decide what I'm gonna wear. It's formal.
- Just a minute. Friday night, you say?
- Yes.
Let me see.
Um, yes. That's all right. I can make it.
- You can make what?
- The dance, of course.
You didn't think I was gonna let you go out by yourself with a cheerleader, did you?
Daddy, you wouldn't spoil everything by doing a thing like that, would you?
- What'll he think of me?
- That you're a sensible... well brought-up child with sensible parents.
Honestly, Dad, don't you trust your own flesh and blood?
Of course I trust you.
I trust all my daughters.
- It's that cheerleader I don't trust.
- Oh, no.
- Now, make up your mind to it.
Either I go, or you don't.
- Well, shall I tell him we'll go in his car or ours?
- His car?
Ho-ho, I should say not. I haven't seen it, but I can imagine what it's like.
We'll go in Foolish Carriage.
Come on, Lillie.
Oh, when you and the others start going out...
I just hope you appreciate what I've had to suffer for you.
- Come on, Joe.
- Okay, baby.
Is your pop ready?
- Great Caesar's ghost, Lillie, it's Joe College in the flesh.
- And if he "pops" me once more,
I'll pop him right back.
- Shh, dear.
- I think he's kind of cute, in a vest pocket way.
- Cute? Heh.
He looks like what might happen if a pygmy married a bob-tailed penguin.
And look at that car.
Well, don't worry.
You'll be riding in yours, not that contraption.
Thank heavens for small favors.
I'd better bring Foolish Carriage around.
Come on, children.
Come on.
Boy, oh, boy.
You look good enough to eat.
And I'll bet you do. Get it?
"I'll bet you do... eat"?
Wort you come in, Joe?
I'd like you to meet my family.
Sure, baby.
It'll be a pleasure.
Now, you children behave yourselves.
- Mother, this is Mr. Scales.
- Good evening, Mr. Scales.
- Hiya, Mrs. Gilbreth.
- I'm fine, thank you.
- And these are Anne's brothers and sisters.
- Hiya, gang.
- Hi.
- This is quite a family.
Yes. Will you excuse me, please, while I get my wrap?
Why, sure, baby. On the double quick, huh?
- Wort you sit down, Mr. Scales?
- No, thanks. I'd rather stand.
We'll only be a minute.
- Well, just make yourself at home.
- Yeah, sure. Thanks.
- What's new, kids?
- Nothir.
- Um, did you ever see a William Tell tie?
- Uh-uh.
You didn't, huh? Well, you pull the bow, and it hits the apple, get it?
It hits the apple... the Adam's apple, see?
Gee, you're the first cheerleader we ever saw up close.
- Yeah?
- How about showing us how you do a yell?
- Andy and Ern taught most of'em to us.
- I don't mind if I do.
- Do you know the old Montclair High rah?
- We know that one.
Let's hit it.
Let me get rid of my hat.
- I wanna hear you holler, get me?
- Yeah.
- Ready?
- Rah! Rah! Rah, rah, rah!
Rah, rah, Montclair! Rah, rah, Montclair!
Hoo-rah! Hoo-rah!
Oh, you Montclair!
- Psst. Psst.
- Gee, I wish
I could be a cheerleader.
- You gotta get elected.
- But don't you have to practice?
- I don't know. It just comes natural.
- The car won't start.
- What'll I do?
- Go in his car.
Do I look like a chicken waiting for a place to roost?
He isn't very big.
I don't think anything will happen to Anne.
Maybe if you warn her to come home early.
I said I was going and I am, even if it has to be in that insane calliope.
- Daddy, have you metJoe?
- Uh, not yet, I haven't.
All set, huh?
Mighty fancy, I'll say.
- This is my father, Mr. Gilbreth.
- Pleased to meet you, Mr. Gilbreth.
- Good evening, young man.
- I hear you kind of go in for this time-saving racket.
I manage to make a fair living.
- I got a few ideas
I'd like to talk to you about sometime.
- That would be a great pleasure.
- We're late. Don't you think we ought to go?
- Let's shake that thing.
- Good night, gang. Good night, Mrs. Gilbreth.
- Good night!
- Good night, Mr. Scales.
Have a good time, dear.
- We will, Mother.
I know it's not your fault, Lillie... but things would have been a whole lot easier... if you'd taken my advice and had all boys.
I'm sorry, dear.
I'll try to be more careful with the next dozen.
Boy, is that a car!
I bet you he can do 50 in it.
What's so wonderful about that?
Fifty's not so fast.
- Yeah? Well, I'd like to see you do it, fatty.
- You shut up.
Shh!
- Good night, Mother.
- Good night, dear.
How's about the little old rumble seat, pops?
You know the old saying, "Two's company."
I'm well acquainted with that expression, young man.
- You all right, Dad?
- Dandy.
And now, if you'll be good enough to keep it down to a dull roar, let's go.
Right!
- Special delivery for Mr. Frank Gilbreth.
- I'll sign for it.
- Thank you.
- Good night.
Good night.
- Who's it from?
- It's postmarked "Prague."
- Mother, it's the invitation.
- Oh, I hope so.
- Go on, Mother. Open it.
You know Dad would want you to.
- Yes, go on.
- But I hate to open anyone else's mail.
- Oh, but this is different.
- Yes, I suppose he wouldn't really mind.
- Of course he wouldn't.
Listen.
"Dear Gilbreth...
"the board of directors of the International Management Conference...
"have voted unanimously to extend to you an invitation... to speak at their forthcoming meeting in Prague."
- Oh, Mother.
- "At the same time, I am reliably informed...
"a similar invitation will be extended to you... to address the World Power Conference in London. Bleneim."
- Gee, and Dad just missed it.
- I wish I could get this to him somehow.
- Couldn't we telephone him?
- There's no telephone in the gym.
- You hop on your bicycle and run down there and give it to him.
- Okay, Mother. Sure.
That's a good boy.
Wouldn't you give anything to see Daddy's face when he reads it?
Yes, dear, anything.
Well, unfortunately, I can't ride a bicycle.
- Hiya, Joe. Hi, Anne.
- Hiya, fellas. Here you are, sonny boy.
What held you two up?
Kinda early to start neckir, ain't it?
- Shh. Lxnay. Lxnay.
- Oh, excuse me, sir.
Hello, Anne. Hi, Anne.
Gee, it's her father.
- What's he doing here?
- Chaperoning Anne. Isn't it a scream?
The way that cookie's looking tonight, she needs chaperoning.
- Hiya, Joe.
- Hiya, pal.
- Where'd you get the hand-me-downs?
- Easy. Don't bruise the material.
Hey, Joe, who's the third wheel?
Yeah, you said it.
Third wheel is right.
You see, Dad? Everybody's talking.
I don't know why boys even bother with me.
Well, I know, if you don't, and that's exactly why I'm here.
- Don't you sort of feel like... like what they said... a third wheel?
- Yes.
That's what I'm gonna keep on being.
I might not be able to whip some of these fullbacks... but if I see any of them start taking liberties... at least I'll be able to run for help.
All set, baby? Come on.
Let's give it the old hips.
So long, pop.
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
"Pop."
- Lipstick, honey?
- No, thanks.
Do me a favor, will you, sugar?
Look in my bag and hand me my perfume.
Sure, Debby.
Oh, what a darling bottle.
- Well, go ahead. Help yourself.
- Oh, I don't think I should. I never use perfume.
You don't? Why, I'd simply die before I'd go out without my perfume on.
Why, I'd feel positively naked.
Go on. Put a little behind your ear.
Well, maybe just a dab won't matter.
Oh, it's wonderful, Debby.
A little old boy I met in New Haven sent it to me.
You know something? I just got to meet your daddy. I think he's so cute.
All the girls at school do.
I could just eat him up.
That's nice, but he's kind of old-fashioned, you know.
Then I'll just adore him,
'cause I'm awfully old-fashioned myself too.
Maybe it's 'cause
I was born in Mississippi.
You got to be old-fashioned to be born in Mississippi.
But you will be careful, won't you, Debby... about the perfume and lipstick and everything?
Now, don't you worry, honey. My daddy's the same way... always carryir on about me.
But I notice he doesn't carry on when it's someone else's daughter.
- Dad?
- Oh, Anne.
Dad, I'd like you to meet one of my very dearest friends, Deborah Lancaster.
- She's from Mississippi.
- How do you do?
I've just been dying to get somebody to introduce me, Mr. Gilbreth.
Why, I've been hoping to meet you ever since you started visiting our school.
Is that so? Well, well.
I'm delighted. Delighted.
So, you're from
Mississippi, are you?
Yes, sir. I'm just a little old fugitive from a plantation.
Pardon me.
- Hello, Debby.
- Hello, honey.
- Dad, this is Tom Black.
- How do you do?
- How are you, Mr. Gilbreth?
- I'm very well, thank you, young man.
- At least I was.
- I'm sorry. How about a dance?
- You mind, Dad?
- Not at all.
- I'm sure this young lady and I will have a very pleasant time.
- We won't be long.
- Hey, what have you done to yourself?
- Nothing. What do you mean?
You didn't look like this in Nantucket last summer, baby.
- How would you know what I looked like?
You never even noticed.
- Well, I'm noticing you now... and I mean.
If you'd rather be out there dancing, don't let me detain you.
Oh, no, Mr. Gilbreth.
I'd much rather sit this one out with you.
Anne tells me you've just been revolutionizing industry... just saving millions of dollars in time and things.
- By jingo, that smells good.
- Do you like it?
A little old boy from New Haven sent it to me. But I mean,
What does anybody want to save all that time for, Mr. Gilbreth?
So as to be able to sit here and talk... to a...
Pretty little lady like you.
Why, I declare. Anne didn't tell me she had such a gallant daddy... and so good-looking too.
- I wouldn't go so far as to say that.
- You'd be surprised... at the things other girls are saying about you.
Why, they're only hopir you'll come to all our dances from now on.
Is that so?
Well, if I'd known that...
I'd have started comir sooner.
There just gonna hate me if they don't get to meet you too. You mind?
Oh, no. No. Of course not.
Bring 'em over. As many as you like.
Oh, thank you, sugar... I mean...
Excuse me, Mr. Gilbreth.
Now, don't you go away, you hear me?
I'll be right back.
- How about some punch?
- Oh, I'd love some.
- Say, your old man sure is swell.
- Dad's really sweet, but...
Believe me, you've got to hand it to him, coming here like this just to look after you.
- I tried to get him not to, but...
- I'll get it.
- Excuse me, Mike.
- Sure, Tom.
Hope you like pineapple.
- I do.
- I mean, where are you gonna find fathers like yours today?
- Sure bet you're proud of him.
- Proud of him?
If I ever have a daughter,
I'm sure gonna watch after her.
You aren't gonna catch me letting her run around... by herself with guys, you know, trying to act funny.
- You aren't?
- You wouldn't catch me marrying anybody... whose folks let her act like that either.
- You wouldn't?
- Oh, a fella likes to run around with 'em, maybe... just for a good time before he gets married, but... when it comes to settling down, none of these flappers for me.
- I want a girl I can respect.
- Why, that's funny.
That's what my mother says.
Believe me, baby, she's right.
I've been around, and I know.
Well, of course it does make a girl feel awfully good... to know that her parents care what she does.
Sure makes you stop and think, all right... an important man like Mr. Gilbreth sitting in there all by himself... not even dancing, just watching.
- I... I was just about to ask him to dance when you came over.
- Yeah? Well, come on.
I guess I can spare one dance. But just one, you understand. The rest are mine.
- What aboutJoe Scales?
- That wet smack?
- After all, he is my date.
What am I gonna do with him?
- Throw him back, baby.
He's too small to keep anyhow.
Look!
- I can't believe it.
- Well, what do you know? Say, not bad, either.
- Come on. Let's dance.
- No, wait a minute.
- I have an idea something tremendous has happened.
- Yeah? What?
- Oh, you wouldn't understand, only I guess it's my salvation.
- I don't get it.
- It's too deep for me.
- I'll tell you someday. Excuse me.
Excuse me.
- Excuse me, Dot. May I cut in, please?
- Oh, certainly, Anne.
- I just love dancing with you, Mr. Gilbreth.
- Thank you, young lady.
- Well, I hope you haven't been too lonely, Dad.
- Oh, no. I've managed.
Funny. I didn't know you could dance.
There's lots of things you don't know, young lady.
- Maybe you ought to congratulate me.
- What for?
After all, it isn't every girl in Montclair High... whose father can be the belle of the ball.
I wanted to show friends of yours they're not the only ones who can dance.
- Your mother and I...
- Okay, Dad. I understand.
Now, let's be honest.
They're not really bad kids, are they?
I suppose they're all right, after their fashion.
And you're not really gonna tag along with me every time I go out, are you?
We'll decide that when I get back.
I won't be able to tag along while I'm in Europe.
In Europe?
But I thought you werert going to Europe.
Oh, yes.
I'm gonna speak in London as well as Prague.
- When did you find out?
- The invitation just came.
- Your mother sent it over by Frank.
- Oh, Daddy, that's wonderful.
Now, Anne, dear...
Anne, don't get emotional.
If you're gonna toddle with me, by jingo, let's toddle.
Okay, Dad. Let's go.
Thank you.
- Are you sure you have everything, dear?
- I think so.
- Both your speeches?
- Right here in my briefcase.
- How about your pills?
- Enough to last a lifetime.
- You'd better hurry then.
You haven't much time.
- Be right with you.
Anne? Ernestine?
Come along, girls.
- Your father's ready to leave.
- We're coming.
- Frank, you'd better take his suitcases.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Mother, why can't we go to the station with Daddy?
- Yeah, I wanna see the train.
When I get back,
I'll show you lots of trains.
But I don't intend to start off to Europe wringing wet with tears.
- You know how I feel about good-byes.
- Dad?
- Yes?
- Here's something for you...
- but don't open it till you get on the boat.
- More socks?
Whose idea was it for me to learn to knit in the first place?
Okay, I plead guilty.
Thank you, dear.
Well, I better get started. Trains don't wait, you know. Come on, kids. Let's go.
- Come along, children.
- Don't forget to send postcards from England and Czechoslovakia.
It won't hurt you kids to write me now and then either.
I don't see why we never get to go on a boat to Europe.
After all, Dad, they come cheaper by the dozen.
Ah, not for Eskimos.
I'll leave the car at the garage downtown, Lillie.
This darn carburetor's acting funny again.
- They'll send it back.
- Yes, dear.
Well, good-bye, dear.
Good-bye, Frank.
Take good care of yourself.
Don't worry about me. And if anything comes up and you need me, cable me.
I'll take care of the work here.
You just forget it and enjoy yourself.
I will.
Come here, young lady.
You gonna be a good little girl and eat your spinach for Daddy while I'm gone?
Make you big and strong.
And that goes for you too.
- Good-bye, Lillie.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye, girls.
- Good-bye, Daddy.
- Ernestine.
- Good-bye, Dad.
Anne.
Never mind about you three.
You children behave yourselves.
Do what your mother tells you.
I'll be back in a couple of months.
Good-bye, Mr. Chairman.
I guess I can count on you to keep the bed warm while I'm gone. Ha, ha, ha.
Mighty fine dog.
Good-bye. I'm gonna miss you so much.
A little more attention to books and a little less to that swimming champion... and you'll stand a better chance of getting into college.
- I'll work on it, Dad.
- That's my girl. Lillie?
- Good-bye, dearest.
- Good-bye, dear.
- Have a good time.
- I'll try.
Bring us some souvenirs, Dad.
- Take good care of your mother and don't forget to write.
- We will.
- Good-bye!
- Good-bye! Good-bye!
Good-bye!
Hello? Oh, hello, Dad.
Hey, where are you?
Yes, sir. She's upstairs.
- Oh. Okay, I'll call her. Hey, Mother!
- Yes?
Dad's on the phone. He forgot somethir.
He wants to talk to ya.
- I'll be right down.
- Okay. She's comir, Dad.
Have a good time, now.
Yes, sir. I will. Good-bye.
- He's at the Montclair station.
- Thank you, dear.
- Don't be late for lunch.
- I won't.
Hello, Frank.
Hello? Hello?
Hello, Frank.
Operator.
Operator, are we still connected?
Well, that's funny.
No one answers.
Hello? Hello?
Frank?
Frank!
- Anne.
- Oh, hello, Mrs. Benson.
- Your mother wants you to come home, dears, right away.
- What is it? What's happened?
Your father was taken ill at the station.
I'm afraid it's his heart.
- Is it... Is it bad?
- I don't know how bad, dear.
Mrs. Monahan said you were shopping and asked me to find you.
- Frank's playing ball. Do you know where?
- The school grounds, I guess.
I said I'd pick him up too.
Come on. Let's get in.
You children better go on in.
I'll park in my driveway.
How... How is he,
Mrs. Monahan?
Oh, Andy.
Our daddy's dead.
Sit down, children.
I've called you older children together because
I think you ought to know the situation.
There isn't going to be a great deal of money.
Most of it's had to go back into your father's business.
I talked by telephone to your grandmother in California... and naturally she wants all of us to move out there and live with her.
If it's a matter of money,
I plan not to go to college anyway. I'll get a job.
- I don't want to go to college either, Mother.
- Wait until I've finished.
There's an alternative, but it hinges on your being able to take care of yourselves... and it will involve sacrifices from all of us.
I want you to make the decision. I can go on with your father's work, keep the office open... and that will mean that we can keep the house.
We'll have to let Mrs. Monahan go, and live very simply.
- We couldn't letJim Bracken go, could we?
- Oh, he wouldn't go anyway.
No, I think we can manage with Jim.
And if things work out the way I think they will, Anne, you can go to college later on too.
- You know your father wanted all of you to go to college.
- Don't worry about that, Mother.
Do you want to try it? Can you run the house and look after things until I get back?
- Get back from where, Mother?
- I'm going to Europe.
I'm going to give those speeches for your father in London and Prague.
We all know how much they meant to him, and I'm sure that's the way he would want it.
But as I say, the final decision is up to you.
Oh, Mother, you don't have to ask us.
Why, you know... we'll do anything as long as we can stay together.
Thank you, dear.
I knew that's the way you'd feel about it.
Well, since I'm gonna be planning the meals from now on, I...
I guess I better get started.
- I'll go over everything with Mrs. Monahan.
- Yes, dear.
And I'll see the house is kept nicely, Mother.
Just the way you like it.
- And I'll help her, Mother.
- We all will.
- Thank you, girls.
- Me too, Mother.
Maybe Bill and I better go down and see some used car dealers... about sellir the automobile, Mother.
You'd better tell them to bring a tow car.
You know Foolish Carriage never starts for anyone but Daddy.
- Yeah, and sometimes it wouldn't even start for him.
I'll do all the errands, Mother, and helpJim.
He's getting pretty old.
That's right.
- Well, son?
- Yes, Mother.
From now on, you'll have to be the man of the family.
Sure, Mother.
We'll handle things.
And we'll do a good job too.
You wait and see.
Yes, son.
I know you will.
Anyhow, that's one mars opinion.
Yes, Dad, Gilbreth and Company will go on.
Mother and your even dozen
will see to that.
Mother will go to Europe,
and you'll be proud...
of the way she delivers
those speeches for you.
And she'll go right on,
following in your footsteps...
to become the foremost woman industrial
engineer in the world and, by 1948...
America's Woman of the Year.
But wherever you are,
Dad, somehow I'm sure you know that...
and never doubted it
for a moment. http:/www.divx-titlovi.com
Jules Verne wrote many books.
He was able to transfer his soaring imagination to print.
His predictions were bold.
What he wrote was regarded as fantastic fiction... but much of it has become fact.
Flying machines, submarines, television, rockets.
But not even his imagination could shrink the earth... to the point it has now reached.
He wrote a book called
From the Earth to the Moon.
And in Paris, that authentic genius Georges MÈliËs... turned it into a movie, 35 millimeter... just as you're looking at it now.
It was, of course, fantasy.
But as of now, no one has yet gone to the moon... to see whether MÈliËs was right.
Here is the actual film as MÈliËs' camera recorded it... at the turn of the century.
I suppose that since man began to walk upright,,,
he has been interested in space and speed,
He has wondered increasingly about the planets he sees in the sky,
The stretching fingertips of science have moved him higher and faster,,,
than man has ever moved before,
One of Jules Verne's characters, a fanatic and a dreamer,,,
argues for the construction of a rocket to the moon,
After reasoned discourse, the venture is launched,
This is the first photographic dissolve,
This is a do-it-yourself rocket,
Rockets have changed,
Photography has changed,
Costumes have changed,
But some things remain unchanged, even in Verne and MÈliËs'imagination,
Jules Verne's rocket returns to the earth,,,
a minor planet, where fiction lags behind fact,
Ten, nine,,,
eight, seven, six, five,,,
four, three, two, one, Fire!
There is, in this power of destruction,,,
also the promise of hope,
A world of unlimited power and limitless hope,
Man has devised a method of destroying most of humanity,,,
or of lifting it up to high plateaus of prosperity and progress,,,
never dreamed of by the boldest dreamer,
You are now looking at the receding shape of this planet Earth,
This is how the earth looks from a camera in the rocket,
Jules Verne wrote a book about going around the world in 80 days,
He even predicted it could be done in 80 hours,
Today it can be done in less than half that time,
But each journey must have an end,
Speed is good only when wisdom leads the way,
The end of this journey,,,
whether to the high horizons of hope or the depths of destruction,,, will be determined by the collective wisdom... of the people who live on this shrinking planet.
There was a time not so long ago when learned men thought that was flat.
Around The World In 80 Days is the Jules Verne classic.
And the world was already shrinking when it was written.
And that was in 1872.
Get your morning paper here.
All about the bank robbery here.
Paper, sir?
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, Thorndyke.
- Hinshaw.
- Yes, sir.
Someone's been tampering with my Telegraph. The pages are crushed.
One of the members borrowed it to read about the robbery.
You mean iùs been used?
- Kindly remove it and send for a fresh one.
- At once, sir.
I'm a patient man, Hinshaw, but don't trespass on my good feelings.
Pilbeam! Did you hear that?
- Some fellow stole that chap's paper.
- The devil you say!
Word of honor.
First time iùs happened here, to my knowledge, in 45 years.
The club's going to the dogs.
Next thing you know, the members will be talking to each other!
- Yes, iùs the thin end of the wedge.
- Oh, dog!
- Ice, my lord?
- Ice?
Certainly not.
What do I look like, a polar bear?
Sorry, sir. Several of the members use it now and then.
Learned it from some Yankee, I dare say.
Those redskins over there drink anything.
A dangerous custom, as I've always thought, sir.
A man might catch a nasty chill on his liver.
Or break a tooth.
Remind me to speak to the House committee about it.
No, by Gad! I'll write a letter to The Times.
- I say, Hinshaw.
- Yes, Mr. Mockridge?
Must we have that confounded animal around here, stamping its feet?
- Mind the horses!
- That bloke is barmy!
There's a sight!
Move over!
Move that confounded contraption!
When I placed you with Mr. Fogg a fortnight ago...
I warned you that he was an eccentric.
An eccentric, Mr. Hesketh-Baggott?
The man's a tyrant.
A cold-hearted, implacable fiend.
Must I remind you that you are speaking of a member of the Reform Club?
I don't care if he's member of the
Worshipful Company of Fishmongers.
The man's mad!
Actually, excessive sanity is not a necessary qualification... for that particular institution.
Believe me, sir, he is not human.
Do you know how many valets he's had in six months?
Certainly I do.
I've supplied him with five of them myself.
And are you aware that he tortured them with a refinement of cruelty... which would have put Torquemada and the entire Spanish Inquisition to shame!
He's as cold and methodical as those two watches he carries about with him.
You are abandoning yourself to rhetoric.
Remember, you've been rigorously trained as a gentleman's gentleman.
A gentleman's gentleman is one thing, sir.
A whimpering, cringing... slave is another.
You are allowing your native imperturbability... to be swept away by a spate of mounting hysteria.
- You really must calm down.
- I can't help it, sir.
If you knew how ardently
I have worked for Mr. Fogg... how enthusiastically I have endeavored to cater to his every whim.
His bath water had to be exactly one foot, three and one-quarter inches.
No less, no more.
His morning toast had to be
83 degrees Fahrenheit.
- No more, no less.
- Extraordinary.
How does one take the temperature of toast?
Incidentally... have you found out anything definite about him?
Who he is, what he does?
- Not the faintest indication, sir. Have you?
- Alas, no.
All I have discovered is entirely negative.
He is not a professional man, and he isn't in trade.
He has no family connections or background worth mentioning.
He doesn't go in for hunting, or fishing, or wenching.
Cannot imagine how he ever got into the Reform Club!
Perhaps your uncle the Bishop might inquire for you.
- He is a member, is he not?
- One of the most distinguished, Foster.
We are a very ancient family, you know.
I was just rather curious about our precious Mr. Fogg.
I suppose he'll be hectoring me soon for someone to fill your place.
Thank you for your cooperation, Foster.
We must pray for guidance.
You have a nice little position for a gentleman's gentleman, sir?
- For you?
- Yes, sir.
Never doubt for one instant, Foster... the efficacy of prayer.
What is your name?
Passepartout.
I am from a very ancient family, sir.
Obviously.
You've had a rather speckled career, I see.
Professor of gymnastics...
- Yes, sir. Watch.
- No demonstrations, please.
Trapeze artist, fireman, chimney sweep.
- Amazing. How did you come to England?
- In a clothes basket, sir.
I escaped.
- From what?
- Women, sir.
A ladies' man?
There are no women in this household.
Now, my conditions are strict.
My timetable never varies.
When I say breakfast at 8:24...
- I do not mean at 8:23 or at 8:25.
- Yes, sir.
- Do you have a watch?
- Yes, sir.
Iùs probably wrong.
Very well. See that you behave yourself.
Any tomfoolery and out you go.
Come on, Ralph, don't be so secretive.
You're one of the governors of the bank.
Yes. Leùs have some lurid details.
Nothing to tell.
You've read the newspapers.
They always exaggerate.
You mean to say the thief actually got away with £55,000?
He did, in brand new bank notes.
Large denominations, £500 or £1,000 each.
How did you know?
We didn't disclose that to the press.
I assumed it.
£55,000 of small currency would have needed a handcart to transport it.
It must have been compact enough to stuff into one's pockets.
You're right. The man's audacity staggers the imagination.
Imagine sauntering up to the head cashier's table... and pilfering a sum like that from under his nose.
Serves you right, in a way.
Surely you have a better hiding place for your funds than the cashier's nose.
Your persiflage does not amuse.
This has been an unexpected blow to us.
Unexpected, Mr. Ralph?
Bankers must expect robbery the same way chickens expect hawks.
Iùs an occupational hazard.
My lead, I believe.
By the way, what was the head cashier doing at the time?
He was writing a receipt for the three-shilling deposit.
Go ahead and jeer. We'll lay the culprit by the heels soon enough.
We've notified detectives all over the world... from Liverpool to Cairo.
We've issued descriptions throughout
Europe and America. He won't get far.
I wouldn't underestimate him if I were you.
You're dealing with a rather exceptional person.
Really? In what way?
Only a cool and logical man could have engineered such an exploit.
Obviously a gentleman with a considerable presence of mind.
You seem to know rather more about this affair than the police.
Merely what one might deduce from the facts.
Our trick.
If you ask me,
I'd say the odds were in favor of the thief.
If he's a resourceful chap, as Fogg says, he'll find plenty of places to hide.
Yes. The worlÔs a pretty large affair, after all.
It was 100 years ago, not any longer.
A man can girdle the globe now in three months.
Less than that, to be precise. In 80 days.
You mean a complete tour all around the world in 80 days?
I mean just that.
- He's talking nonsense.
- No, Fogg may have a point there.
The Great Indian Peninsula Railway was opened a fortnight ago.
That shortens the trip.
I read it in The Daily Telegraph.
Hang The Daily Telegraph.
I say iùs impossible.
Nothing is impossible.
When science conquers the air it may be feasible to circle the globe in 80 hours.
Iùs a beautiful dream, but I'm talking about this moment... and I say nobody can go around the world in 80 days.
I agree.
Even if one made ideal connections at every point... there'd still be typhoons, shipwrecks, unforeseen delays.
I include the unforeseen.
All very glib, Fogg, but I'd like to see you do it in 80 days.
You're convinced that I could not?
So much so that I'll wager £5,000 that you can't.
Let me understand you clearly.
Are you formally challenging me... to undertake a journey around the world in 80 days?
I am, and I'm prepared to back my conviction by posting my check now.
Very well, I accept.
This is absurd. The joke's gone far enough.
An Englishman never jokes about a wager.
I have on deposit at Barings Bank the sum of £20,000.
I'm willing to wager any or all of it upon the same contention.
Namely, that I can complete a tour of the world in 80 days.
That is to say, in 1,920 hours or 115,200 minutes.
Would anyone besides Stuart care to participate?
I'm no gambler, but if you want to make foolhardy bets... that you can't possibly win,
I'm afraid I'll be forced to take you on.
I'm with you.
So am I. What about you, Ralph?
My affiliation with the Bank of England naturally precludes my betting... but as a member of this club I might, under very special circumstances.
Then iùs agreed?
- We all accept?
- Yes.
Good. If I remember correctly, the boat train for Dover... leaves London Bridge station at 8:45 tonight.
- I will be on it.
- Tonight?
Don't you need some days to settle your affairs...
- to make preparations?
- No. I'm quite ready now.
You engage to be back here in London, in the Reform Club... on Saturday, September 21 at 8:45 p.m.
Right, gentlemen.
Clubs, I believe, are still trumps?
Shall we finish the game?
- Yes, please?
- Come to my bedroom at once,
Yes, sir.
- I called you twice.
- I came as fast as possible, sir.
You are not supposed to be home yet, sir.
My usual routine is beside the point.
We leave for the Continent in 10 minutes.
- Monsieur is going traveling?
- Yes. Around the world.
Then you will not be here for breakfast.
Around the world?
Exactly. Now reassemble your faculties and start packing.
Which clothes does monsieur...
I mean, which trunks?
None whatever. Just take two shirts and three pairs of hose for each of us.
- But I have only one shirt, sir.
- Then take that.
We'll buy whatever else we need en route.
Give me that red bag.
Open it up.
We're going to need plenty of money.
Whatever you do, never let this out of your sight.
Monsieur can trust me.
I will cherish it like a woman.
Don't make love to it. Just watch it.
Excuse me, sir. My cousin.
Mademoiselle,
Excuse me, sir. Iùs not my cousin.
Thomas Cook and Son.
You purchase the tickets.
I'll be back in a moment.
All right, sir.
Now, monsieur, train to Marseilles... steamer to Bombay via Suez, across India by train... and steamer again to Hong Kong.
Only one drawback.
With this route, you miss Bali and the women.
But no, women of Bali cannot be described.
- Please try.
- No, monsieur. Words would fail me.
In any case, in Yokohama, you will encounter the geisha girls...
and those, monsieur, are not to be sneezed at.
I shall remember.
In Yokohama,
I must not sneeze at geisha girls.
Then, between San Francisco and New York... you will discover Indian maidens galore... statuesque, barbaric creatures.
What a crime you have only 80 days.
However, first things first.
Here are your tickets to Marseilles.
Cancel those tickets.
They are of no further use to us.
We cannot go by train.
Has something happened? A wreck?
An avalanche has sealed the Montfort tunnel... and nothing can get through for a week.
Then the roads are blocked, too.
How can we go on?
I don't know. But I refuse to be daunted at this stage of the game.
There must be another way.
There has to be.
But after all, we are not birds.
We cannot fly across the mountains.
That, monsieur, is not unfeasible, fantastic as it seems.
Isn't she lovely?
I have made 63 ascents, gentlemen... to an elevation over 1,000 meters.
I've flown through the skies at a speed surpassing that of an eagle.
Are you quite sure this is not just Gallic braggadocio?
You are now addressing the second most-celebrated balloonist in Europe.
- And who is the first?
- He is not available.
He was buried last Tuesday.
Tell me, is this apparatus of yours for lease?
Lf I operate it, yes.
If you do, iùs only for sale.
- Passepartout, the bag.
- Yes, sir.
- We purchase your balloon, sir.
- Thank you, sir.
Iùs really very simple.
We empty out some sand... and we go up.
Then we pull this... and with any luck, we come down.
I imagine we release some gas from the top of the balloon.
Gas! I forgot to turn off the gas in my room.
No matter. It will continue to burn, at your expense.
Gentlemen, I think this calls for a restrained celebration.
Guess whaùs become of the intrepid Mr. Fogg?
- What?
- He's drifting over the Alps in a balloon.
Whaùs he doing in one of those?
Don't ask me, but iùs here in this paper.
I say, he never mentioned the word balloon.
Not very sporting, is it?
Rather sly, if you ask me.
I wouldn't have thought it of old Fogg.
I don't know, seems quite resourceful to me.
English ingenuity, never say die, all that sort of thing.
Does it happen to mention over which Alps he's drifting?
No. I assumed they were the ones in Switzerland.
Use your globe, sir.
Could be the Maritime Alps, in the south of France.
In which case Fogg's not only on schedule, but ahead of it.
We stand to lose £20,000.
What was that you said about a celebration, Stuart?
Lf nobody wants this newspaper,
I'll just put it on the table.
The southern perimeter of France.
Often and with justification referred to in the guidebooks as the "Azure Coast."
- The moment is propitious for our descent.
- Yes, sir.
The gas valve's stuck, I think.
Can you get up there?
I'll try it, master.
They're speaking some bizarre foreign tongue.
- Do you understand them?
- Yes.
Ask them how far we are from Marseilles... and what conveyance they have for us to proceed.
- Why aren't they speaking French?
- Because we are in Spain, master.
- Spain?
- Yes, sir.
Iùs a long trip to Marseilles.
But by sea, in a fast boat, 10 hours.
Where would we procure such a boat?
There is one vessel here.
The boat of Abdul Achmed of Tangiers.
Where would we find this worthy?
He sleeps by day.
But at night, he's in the Cave of the Seven Winds.
- Think thaùs the man we're looking for?
- I think so, master.
Excuse me, master.
Good evening, sir.
It is forbidden to approach his august personage.
Perhaps you would transmit a message?
I would like to engage his yacht for a quick trip to Marseilles.
I will pay whatever he asks.
The ship is yours, sir.
Go where you wish without charge.
However, my master is an aficionado of the bullfight.
That is why he visits here, to see the festival of the bulls.
I do not understand.
He was most interested in your servanùs display of cape work.
He would like to see more tomorrow, at the bullfight.
You mean he wants him to enter the ring?
But that will be a massacre!
Please, master. I'm not afraid. Let me try.
Don't push me.
Iùs the first time I've seen a real bull.
Look at the horns. Iùs not my size.
Try to be nice to me.
My ship is yours.
If you leave now you'll arrive in Marseilles in 10 hours.
The odds are 30-to-1, gentlemen.
£50 he doesn't.
- What was that, Mr. Vermilyea?
- I said, £50 he doesn't.
And £150 he does.
Why delude ourselves?
Even if the odds do go down...
we know that Fogg got from Marseilles to Brindisi in time to catch the Mongolia.
But supposing he doesn't get to Suez in time?
His itinerary's thrown out of schedule.
He can't possibly get from Bombay to Calcutta in time for his connection.
Our money's as safe, gentlemen, as if it were in the Bank of England.
Sorry.
A bulletin, gentlemen. A late bulletin.
Mr. Phileas Fogg has arrived at Suez!
- Name, sir?
- Passepartout.
- Thank you.
- Here! Just a minute.
Where's the gentleman who owns this passport, this Mr. Phileas Fogg?
- My master is staying on board.
- Indeed.
He'll have to report in person to the British Consulate... to establish his identity.
- Is that necessary?
- Not necessary, mandatory.
Iùs mandatory. This is different, sir.
Mr. Fogg is at lunch now, but I will give him your message.
Hello there.
Going sightseeing? Perhaps I can help.
I have to buy some clothing for Mr. Fogg.
I can show you an excellent place quite nearby.
Monsieur is very kind.
You see, my master and I came away without our clothes.
Then I take it you left London hastily?
Forty-five minutes after he told me...
- we are off around the world.
- Around the world?
Yes, sir. Around the world in 80 days.
He says iùs a wager.
But confidentially, between you and me,
I don't believe a word of it.
Something else in the wind?
I understand he gave the officers of the Mongolia a bonus...
- to get the ship here ahead of time.
- Yes, sir.
He must be a very rich man.
You can't imagine how much money we carry with us... all in brand-new bank notes.
I'm sure you can take good care of him.
No doubt you've been with Mr. Fogg for years.
No, sir. On the contrary.
I entered his service only the day we left London.
Indeed.
So he turned up, did he?
Yes, and he gave every indication of being a thoroughly honest fellow.
Or a very shrewd article.
Here's the description of the robber
I received from London.
Yes. It tallies exactly.
What do you propose to do?
Notify London to send a warrant to Bombay... accompany him there and arrest him the moment he sets foot on British soil.
Very enterprising of you, Fix.
A nice ocean voyage at the expense of Scotland Yard?
I beg your pardon, sir.
I see my duty, and I do it.
Thank you, sir.
I beg pardon, gentlemen, we're expecting rather hot weather tomorrow... so I've arranged the menu accordingly:
"Cold breast of chicken, potted meats and brawn...
- "curried lamb and rice."
- Capital.
Curry's the only dish for a chap in this filthy climate.
Purifies the blood, tones up the system.
My luncheon will remain the same, steward.
Kindly adhere to my instructions.
Of course, sir.
But all that food on a hot day?
Steward, my Thursday midday meal has always been... and will always be hot soup, fried sole... roast beef and Yorkshire pudding, baked potatoes, suet pudding and treacle.
Your deal, monsieur.
We meet again.
Feeling the heat a bit, are you?
How about a nice lemon squash or a beer?
- Iùs good.
- Steward.
Bring two lemon squashes.
Great stroke of luck we happen to be on the same ship.
And both going to Bombay.
Yes. A strange coincidence.
- Have you made this trip before?
- Yes, often.
I'm one of the agents for the steamship company.
- You know India well?
- My dear fellow...
I doubt if there are five men who know it as I do.
The mosques, the minarets, the elephants, the snakes.
What about the women?
Yes. The women. Superb.
- In what way superb?
- Goddesses. Ravishing.
But listen, this tour of your master's... what do you think his real purpose is?
Perhaps iùs only a secret diplomatic mission.
I tell you, Mr. Fix.
I really know nothing about it.
Don't change the conversation.
Tell me more about these Indian women.
Now, let me see.
Would you excuse me?
I will be back in a minute.
Bombay by dawn tomorrow, Mr. Fogg.
Two days ahead of schedule.
- Thaùs a new record for the run.
- A remarkable achievement, Captain... and one that deserves adequate recognition.
- My compliments to you.
- Thank you.
And to the chief engineer. As arranged.
Listen carefully.
Here's the list of the gear we'll need on our journey to Calcutta.
While you're getting that,
I'll deal with the passports and the tickets.
The train leaves at 4:00.
We'll meet at the railway station.
How dare you! Thaùs a sacred animal!
We've no warrant for this fellow's arrest.
The whole thing is highly irregular.
But he's the culprit, I swear to you.
Wait a moment. I have an idea.
You issue the order for this arrest.
What? I couldn't do a thing like that!
Not even for a reward of £2,000?
Needless to say, I'd be willing to divide it.
£1,000? No, Mr. Fix.
The matter involves London.
And the London office alone can legally deliver the warrant.
Once Fogg's outside British jurisdiction,
I'll never get him.
Quite. Good heavens! 4:00. Iùs tea time.
Yes, I know. But this is a crisis.
Crisis or no, nothing should interfere with tea.
Devil take the man. Where can he be?
Pattering after some woman or other, I suppose.
These foreigners, you know.
Come on, man! Come on!
- Thank you.
- There will be no further fiddle-faddle.
Years gone... there was a time when one could scarcely travel... in this part of the country without encountering corpses.
Those infamous stranglers.
What did you say the name of the sect was?
Thuggee.
Individual members are known as Thugs.
They worship Kali, the goddess of death.
They slay without discrimination.
Any age, sex, color.
How did you finally manage to stamp them out?
We didn't. Not entirely.
Our constabulary managed to diminish the number of murders... but we're forced to recognize the Thuggee still exists.
Every few months we come across a few of the wretches with their ghastly rites.
Strange we should stop hereabouts.
Timetable makes no mention of a station in this vicinity.
I have no idea.
I haven't been on this line since they announced its completion.
Excuse me, sir. What is the difficulty?
Difficulty? None whatever.
This is the end of the line.
- End of the line?
- Yes.
There's still 50 miles of track to be laid between here and Allahabad.
The London newspapers announced the opening of the railway throughout.
Musùve been The Daily Telegraph.
Never woulÔve read it in The Times.
The fact remains that you sell tickets from Bombay to Calcutta! Thaùs fraud.
I shall take this up with the Viceroy!
The notice in our Bombay station is quite clearly posted, as it is here:
"Passengers must provide their own transportation...
"between Kholby and Allahabad."
- Through the bush?
- I'm sorry if this inconveniences.
It does indeed.
I happen to be rejoining my brigade, the 10th Jubbulpore.
My friend stands to lose a considerable sum of money.
Not at all. I made provision for precisely that sort of eventuality.
You couldn't have foreseen this.
No, but I did expect some such obstacle to arise en route.
And I took the precaution of gaining two days while crossing the Arabian Sea.
A steamer leaves Calcutta at noon on the 25th for Hong Kong.
Our only problem is to find some form of conveyance from here to Allahabad.
Other than the oxcart, nothing can get through that jungle.
- What about an elephant?
- I do know of one... but I doubt if the owner would part with her.
- Why not?
- She sleeps in the house, with the family.
A pet.
£1,000 for an elephant? Lùs outrageous!
You've been diddled.
Undoubtedly, but iùs not often one needs an elephant in a hurry.
- What is that?
- A Royal Bengal Tiger.
They rarely attack an elephant.
- What the deuce are you doing?
- Quiet, sir.
- Is bad.
- What is it?
Lùs a religious procession of some sort.
Rather sticky if they spot us.
I think we had better look into this.
Kali, the goddess of love and death.
Sahib, please! Lf they hear our voices we will be slain.
- Suttee,
- What do you mean by that?
A human sacrifice, but a voluntary one.
The lady you've just seen is to be burned on her husbanÔs funeral pyre.
Scoundrels.
You actually mean that unfortunate woman will be burned alive?
She's quite resigned to it.
Iùs a matter of religious belief.
This area's not under British jurisdiction.
Nothing we can do.
Forgive me, sahib. But the lady does not wish to commit suttee.
- She is being forced.
- What?
Everyone knows of this affair.
Her husband was a rajah and very influential.
- The custom is that she must die with him.
- Where's this murder to take place?
The pagoda of Pillaji. Two miles from here.
What if we decided to save her?
- You can't interfere with native affairs.
- Why not?
Lt isn't done!
My master does things other people do not, sir.
Do you think you can you rescue Aouda?
- Is that the lady's name?
- Yes, sahib. Aouda.
Very fine person. Very beautiful.
She was educated in England.
That decides it.
General, we place ourselves under your command.
Right. Now, our first step is to reconnoiter.
Follow me.
There are guards all about the temple.
- I can't seem to find an opening.
- And the princess?
- Inside. Surrounded by armed men.
- What course would you suggest?
Simple. Outflank the beggars.
Here's the temple. No, here.
Here's the funeral pyre.
We create a distractionary action here, start a sortie here.
- General, I have a plan.
- Please!
Then we infiltrate the guards from the rear.
- Excellent.
- Exactly. Only one problem.
This plan can't possibly work with less than 75 men.
So speaking as a strategist...
I should say our position here is untenable.
Whatever the odds,
I'm determined to abstract that woman.
Even though we're only four.
Passepartout...
Now where the devil is he?
Hurry up! Come on!
- Gentlemen, you have rescued me!
- No demonstrations of gratitude.
Allow me to help you.
"Speechless at the violation of a native temple...
"and the abduction of an Indian princess...
"by Mr. Phileas Fogg, the authorities have arrested him."
"An Indian princess." Lucky dog!
An absolute scandal, according to this.
The whole peninsula's up in arms.
Wonder what she's like.
A handsome creature, I'll be bound.
Always thought Fogg had a twinkle in his eye.
Handsome or not, this barging about a native temple... with one's boots on is a serious matter.
CoulÔve been, if he hadn't posted bail and caught the next ship.
I think our colleague's a good bit cleverer than we supposed.
A devious type, I'd rather say.
Let me see, if he's on the S, S, Rangoon... he must be halfway to Hong Kong by now.
Somewhere here.
So I did the only decent thing a man could do.
- You mean...
- Yes, I finessed my queen of hearts... and forced Finch-Tattersall to sacrifice his ace.
It was a tense moment.
I wish you'd seen
Lord Dudley's expression.
Poor fellow went dead white.
Bit clean through his pipe stem.
- But I'm afraid I've bored you.
- How can you say that, Mr. Fogg?
I don't think in my entire life...
Thaùs the most enthralling story
I've ever heard.
You really mean that?
I'm most awfully pleased.
- Iùs so personal and yet dramatic.
- Thaùs exactly the way I feel about it!
I had no idea you were so keen about whist.
I adore it.
There is a kind of precision about it.
I've always admired men who are precise... who have a sense of order and discipline.
- You don't say that?
- Yes, for example...
I simply cannot abide a man who isn't punctual.
Iùs extraordinary how well you put it.
We have so little time in our brief mortal span.
My dear princess,
I must ask your forgiveness.
- Why, whatever for?
- I completely forgot to... offer my condolences upon your bereavement.
- What?
- To extend my sympathy... for your anguish at this time of grief.
- But I don't feel any grief, Mr. Fogg.
- None at all?
You see, I was a wife in name only.
I met the late rajah exactly once, at the age of seven... before my parents sent me to England for my education.
You never saw him again?
Never.
Would you care to hear about the time
I drew a flush hand in diamonds?
Lf you'd care to confide in me.
Is Mr. Fogg always so proper, haughty and formal?
Believe me, Madame,
I know nothing about him... except that he lives by this.
Have there been any women in his life?
I assume he must have had a mother, but I am not certain.
Perhaps he has some secret sorrow, some love who jilted him.
He has only one love. Cards. Whist.
He thinks of nothing but whist, morning, noon, and night.
Very interesting.
Yes, he's a cool article, Mr. Talley.
A very unpredictable cove.
Just when you think you've cornered him, he gives you the slip.
- Got you puzzled, has he?
- Yes, by jingo, he has.
Look at this heathen young woman, for instance, this Mrs. Aouda.
I know my man.
And I tell you, she don't fit into the pattern.
He was down here, you know, about an hour ago.
He was?
- What did he want?
- This, that, and the other.
He was quizzing me about steamships out of Hong Kong.
- For where?
- Yokohama.
We're due at Hong Kong at noon tomorrow.
He sails on the S, S, Carnatic at 8:00 the next day.
Thaùs what he thinks, but I'll nail him this time... you can pledge your last farthing on that.
You didn't do so well in Calcutta, according to you.
What could I do?
I got him and his servanùs bail set at £1,000 apiece.
And he hands it over without batting a lash.
If that blasted warrant had only arrived...
Cheer up. You've got 20 hours to get him in Hong Kong before the Carnatic sails.
Yes, sir, I'll lag the blighter there if I have to turn out the Governor to do it!
Bulldog tenacity, Mr. Fix, thaùs the spirit that built an empire.
"134 Lower Lascar Row, Victoria."
We will now go in search of your uncle, Mr. Cominjee.
Here, follow that rickshaw, chop-chop!
Here's a pretty kettle of fish.
A man trying to run a business and the door's locked. I wonder what...
Boss man here? Him back pretty soon?
I should say the probabilities are strongly against it.
I beg your pardon. Where is Mr. Cominjee?
In Holland, I believe.
He amassed a considerable fortune by means I shall not attempt to describe... and has retired to Amsterdam to raise tulips.
He might at least have left a card on his door to that effect.
The gentleman was quite illiterate, sir, and moreover, he was pressed for time.
He retired 10 minutes before the constables arrived.
That alters things quite a bit.
Obviously the princess cannot remain here, alone, in Hong Kong.
- There seems to be only one alternative.
- I know what you're going to say... but please don't send me back to India.
If you will excuse me, sir,
I agree with the princess.
You know she has suffered very much.
Your fears are groundless. I have no intention of returning her to India.
She is our responsibility and will continue with us to Europe.
I'll escort her to the Royal Court Hotel and find accommodation for tonight.
You will buy the tickets.
Three cabins on the Carnatic, sailing tomorrow morning for Yokohama.
- And don't dilly-dally.
- Not dilly-dally.
Here, you, follow that ostrich!
Giddy up!
Strike me, iùs my old friend off the Rangoon.
Hello, sir. Excuse me one minute.
Three cabins on the steamer Carnatic, please.
Yes, sir. There's been a slight change in the schedule, sir.
She sails tonight instead of in the morning as planned.
- I didn't know, but all the better.
- Thank you.
That will be all.
- I trust that you will be comfortable here.
- Yes, thank you. I'm sure I will.
Iùs very kind of you to concern yourself about me.
Not at all.
Since you are temporarily alone, the least
I can do is look after your welfare.
I'm afraid I must have been a burden.
Quite the reverse, I assure you.
Your company has been most welcome.
I only wish I could express my infinite gratitude.
Please, you shouldn't do that sort of thing.
Mr. Fogg, why must you be so British?
- Madam, I am what I am.
- No.
You're kind and warm and generous.
Would you care to join me on the veranda?
They serve an outstanding lemon squash.
If you wish.
- I see you're leaving Hong Kong.
- Correct, my friend.
- And 12 hours ahead of time.
- Think of that.
Nothing stops you and Mr. Fogg, does it?
- What name do you want on these tickets?
- Just copy these.
Look here, since we may not see each other again... why don't we have a little farewell drink together?
Good idea.
Nice and cozy.
Over here.
Remember, we don't have very much time.
I have to get my tickets.
Nonsense. We'll send a boy for them.
Here, you.
You know the Transpacific
Steamship Company in Canton Road?
- Near post office?
- Yes. Send someone over there.
Pick up tickets for Mr. Passepartout.
- Passport, too?
- Yes.
- Thank you, sir.
- Well, what will it be?
- A lemon squash.
- Poppycock.
I said I'd buy you a drink, and I meant a man's drink.
All right, anything you want, but not too strong, please.
My friend and I will have a Hong Kong Snickersnee.
- What is that?
- Iùs indescribable. Liquid music.
It warms the heart, fires the imagination, broadens the horizon...
- Whaùs happening?
- Local color.
A sort of a show they put on for the tourists.
Looks very real to me.
They're just boisterous children.
Ignore them.
Now, look here, Passepartout.
You've been square with me and I intend to behave the same.
Do you still think I'm an agent for those fellows at the Reform Club?
- No, but I don't know what you are.
- Then I'll tell you.
I'm a professional detective.
And I'm in pursuit of a very cunning, very slippery criminal.
Who?
Phileas Fogg, Esq., of Savile Row, London.
- What? My master?
- The same.
What do you want from me?
Time. Just help me delay him 24 hours till my warrant arrives.
All I need is a little cooperation on your part.
A little cooperation?
Do you think I'd betray Mr. Fogg?
I don't care how much money you offer me...
All right, you needn't get angry.
I don't blame you, in a way.
It shows you're a loyal and trustworthy chap, and I respect that.
Here. Leùs have a little libation on the altar of friendship.
You insult my master.
I don't want to drink with you.
Rot. You told me where you stood.
And I say bravo to a man who sticks to his principles.
Here. Confusion to the enemies of the Crown.
I can't believe it.
Honorable gentleman feeling better this morning?
What are you doing here?
Why is the hotel moving this way?
What? Steamship, not hotel.
You're on board the steamship Carnatic.
Yes. We go Shanghai, then we go Yokohama.
Finished?
- Where is Mr. Fogg's cabin?
- Next door.
But Mr. Fogg not on board.
- What about the princess?
- Princess? No, you come alone.
Police, they find ticket in your pocket.
Carry you here. You sleep like baby.
I betrayed my master. Everything is lost.
What about my money?
- They robbed me, too.
- Is bad.
You not like Yokohama.
You not have money,
Yokohama not like you.
I betrayed my master.
My good man,
I realize the Carnatic couldn't wait.
The point now is what other vessel can we get?
Nothing that could make the voyage to Yokohama, sir.
No steam packet, tug, or lighter?
There must be something in a port this size.
At the moment, not a thing.
Good morning, Mr. Fogg.
- I'm afraid I don't...
- We traveled together on the Rangoon.
- My name is Fix.
- Yes, Mr. Fix. How do you do?
- I believe you know my manservant?
- Very slightly.
- Why? Has something happened to him?
- The fellow seems to have disappeared.
- I'm sorry to hear that. He's a nice chap.
- I shall have to inform the police.
I shouldn't do that if I were you.
He'll turn up.
- Missed your boat?
- Yes.
- There'll be another along in a week.
- I shall not be here.
- No?
- Yokohama is my destination...
I shall get there if I have to swim.
Are we on a direct course for Yokohama?
The Carnatic is bound first for Shanghai.
We may arrive in Yokohama the day after her.
We're still in plenty of time to catch the General Grant for San Francisco.
Very sporting of you to let me share your craft, Mr. Fogg.
Nonsense.
Anything for a fellow Englishman.
I trust your cousin in San Francisco will be better by the time we arrive.
- Poor old Marmaduke.
- Thank you.
Princess.
Fish, Fix?
Steady, Mr. Fix. Fujiyama ahead.
We'll be in Yokohama by morning.
There's the Carnatic.
I imagine that steamship just behind her is the General Grant.
Now the only thing missing is Passepartout.
The police in Hong Kong said they put him on board.
They also said he was penniless.
So we may have one clue.
The man is a jack of all trades.
He's told me a few of them.
We might be able to find him by deduction.
That is the new science employed by our British police.
Really? I learn something useful every moment I'm with you, Mr. Fogg.
I hope you find your man.
Two orchestra stalls, please.
Great Scott. Look.
Master!
- Master, what genius to find me.
- Merely logic. Now come along.
The General Grant is preparing to sail, and we haven't a moment to lose.
What a pity.
Mr. Fogg has already organized his whist game.
Princess, Mr. Fix is a detective.
He thinks Mr. Fogg has robbed the Bank of England.
Nothing escapes Mr. Fogg.
But Mr. Fix won't delay us.
We're out of British jurisdiction now.
He's in America.
Don't tell me about men. They're all alike.
I wouldn't trust the best of them.
This here Phileas Fogg,
I'm sure he's different.
It takes a gallant, adventurous bloke to dash around the world like that.
Don't be so soppy.
He's probably running away from some housemaid he ruined.
You do have a horrid mind, Cora.
I think he's terribly romantic.
- They say he's so good-looking.
- Rot.
I don't care if he's Venus, Adonis and Mercury both.
He'll never do it in 80 days.
- I bet you 10 bob he don't.
- I'll take that.
Here's my money.
- Where's yours?
- Here it is.
- Whaùs up?
- Call a bobby. I've been robbed.
The voice of all our citizens!
- I ask you, who will you vote for?
- Mandiboy!
Mandiboy is our man!
Please, Mr. Fogg, let me watch.
Is this a religious spectacle?
Some kind of an election, I would judge.
Perhaps they are creating a new president.
Whatever it is,
I suggest that we move over there.
Bye-bye!
Thank you, sir.
Why don't you eat with a fork like everybody else?
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, sir.
Thank you. Iùs good.
For you.
- Iùs good.
- For you.
Do you like it?
- I'll eat it later.
- Scrambled eggs.
How many times did I have to tell you to stay out of here, you donkey? Come on.
Louder.
Looking for someone?
Yes, a small, dark fellow.
He wandered in a few moments ago.
Could be almost anybody.
Sit down and describe him to me.
- I'm afraid I can't. I'm in a hurry.
- Never be in a hurry.
You'll miss the best parts in life.
Madam, you don't understand.
I'm looking for my man.
So am I.
Mr. Fogg, there's Passepartout.
- Put down that chicken and listen to me.
- Yes, master.
This is a primitive country.
We'll need some protection.
- I have this.
- Nothing so medieval. A brace of pistols.
- Pistols?
- Nothing extravagant.
- Oh, no, sir.
- And you have 47 minutes.
- The train leaves on the hour.
- I shall be there.
- I've told you, don't spoil the natives.
- Yes, sir.
Still in a hurry?
I thought the English were a calm, dreamy sort of people.
Listen, you. Get out and stay out.
If I catch you here again
I'll cut you up in a thousand pieces.
That won't be necessary, I assure you.
I'm just leaving.
An unexpected pleasure to meet you here, Mr. Fogg.
- Did you have an enjoyable crossing?
- We didn't see much of you aboard ship.
Yes, I was a victim of mal de mer,
I'm sorry to say.
You won't be lingering in this sort of a hubbub much longer.
- Are you taking the transcontinental train?
- Yes, the very next one. Are you?
- Yes.
- How's your cousin, the one who was ill?
Yes, poor old lady.
She didn't trust the doctors here.
She's gone on to New York.
Thought your cousin was a man.
I remember the name Marmaduke.
Angelica Marmaduke. Lovely old lady.
For a good smoke, try these, gentlemen.
For a good government, vote for Lucius P. Mandiboy.
Thank you, no.
I only smoke my own blend.
You do, do you?
You don't want to befoul your lips with a plebeian cigar?
I just prefer what my own tobacconist compounds for me.
Sweet spirits of niter, aren't you the tender bud.
Tell me, Percy, who you voting for?
Camerfield or Mandiboy?
Neither. I'm a foreign visitor... and therefore unconcerned about who triumphs.
I'll be a ring-tailed sidewinder, if you don't raise my gorge.
Yes sirree Bob!
I'll be a dad-blamed polecat... if you aren't about as ornery a specimen as ever I clapped my eyes on.
What kind of foreigner are you?
Maybe a hootchy-kootchy dancer?
- Unhand that lady, sir.
- Why don't you make me?
- I will, without further invitation.
- Why, you dirty...
Let us proceed.
- Now what is the delay?
- Indians. But they're peaceful Indians.
You can tell that by the peace pipes they're smoking.
Further down the line, they're not so friendly.
Is the entire American population in the way of this train?
These American trains, quite impossible.
Yes, sir. I go, master.
She'll never take the weight of this train.
We better go back.
Whaùs all the fuss here, boys?
Can't you fellows run a railroad without stopping every five minutes?
That bridge won't hardly hold a locomotive.
Why, hang me for a sheep-stealing son of a tarantula... if you ain't a pack of yellow-bellied milksops.
- Am I right, scout?
- Yes, sir, you're right.
- No, I ain't chancing it, fellows.
- Here, take a snort of this 40-rod.
Back up your old teakettle there, and shoot her over at 30 miles an hour.
Let her roll!
Thaùs the spirit, partner.
Bear down on that throttle.
Now thaùs what I call a proper rate of speed.
I'll be a rattlesnake's uncle.
Thought you'd run away, you yellow-bellied lime juicer.
- Hit a man with an iron bar, will you?
- Spades are trumps, I believe.
"Spades are trumps, I believe."
My dear Algernon, really.
- Be so good as to play.
- "Be so good as to play."
Gracious. Why don't you play a man's game?
Poker, red dog, euchre.
Want me to learn you how, Algie boy?
Or should I learn you how to fight fair?
Would you pardon me?
Sir, you are an insolent bully and I demand satisfaction at once.
Mind moving into the other car, please?
Lùll only be a minute or so.
Now, don't miss, boys, you can damage the woodwork.
The company's liable to take it out of my salary.
- Ready, or do you want to holler uncle?
- I'm ready.
We will count to six together, turn, and fire at will.
- Now?
- Now.
One, two, three, four... five, six.
Take this.
Redskins!
Thanks, partner. You may be a foreigner, but you're true-blue.
Are you all right?
I'm all right, but look what they've done to my coat.
The train is running away.
They must have got the engineer and fireman.
What do you suggest?
Fort Kearney's just ahead.
Thaùs where the cavalry is.
- But we'll pass right through at this rate.
- Somebody's got to stop the train.
One of us must get to Fort Kearney.
I'll try.
Poor Passepartout. Not a trace of him.
Everyone else seems to be accounted for.
There's no sign of your valet.
I'm afraid he's fallen into the hands of the Sioux.
It was a deliberate sacrifice to save the rest of us.
- What will they do to him?
- The Sioux are pretty merciless.
You've heard about their tortures.
Colonel, we must send a rescue party at once.
Excuse me, mister.
I know it sounds kind of heartless... but we can't hold the train.
Thaùs a minor consideration.
A man's life is at stake.
Any of you want to volunteer for a raid against the Sioux?
- I will, sir!
- I will!
Lùs too warm.
Don't be blue, folks.
Everything is gonna be all right.
There'll be a local through here tomorrow.
Thaùll fetch you into Omaha the day after.
Yes, and lose 24 hours.
If we miss our steamship in New York, how will we get to Liverpool on time?
I'm darned if I understand you city folks.
Always rushing.
Always thinking about the future.
No wonder you have stomach trouble.
Iùs all my fault, sir.
You should have caught the train and let those Indians cook me.
Then everyone woulÔve been happy.
Balderdash.
What I always say is, iùs an ill wind that blows no good.
Ease off the halyards.
Steady, man.
Look, the train. The train broke down.
Stop the wind, master.
Contain yourself, Passepartout.
Everything's under control.
Those homemade American trains.
Goodbye.
Well-played, Dennis.
You have a natural aptitude for the game.
Perfected by four years of practice at Oxford.
I did nothing else.
Cost my poor old governor over £12,000.
Worth every penny of it.
Hello, Sir Wilmette.
Haven't seen you in donkey's years.
- Are you staying at the club?
- No.
- You have a house in town, no doubt?
- No.
- Then you live in the country, do you?
- No.
- Anywhere near London?
- No.
Hard luck.
Good day.
Here we are, gentlemen.
From the British Consulate, New York.
Things are looking up.
"Phileas Fogg and party presented their passports...
"at 2:30 Greenwich time this afternoon."
- What time did that steamship sail?
- Wait, I have a schedule here.
Here we are. "City of Paris..."
No, thaùs yesterday's.
Wait a minute.
"Cunarder, China. New York, Liverpool."
- Sailed today, 9:00 a.m.
- He's missed it by five hours.
Not another eastbound vessel for three days.
I don't wish to crow, gentlemen, but I feel the crisp crackle of £20,000.
Leùs crack that bottle of champagne we've been saving.
Right you are. But first, what about a bet or two on the side... before this information leaks out?
- We better get over to LloyÔs.
- Come on.
Listen.
They opened the telegram while I was there.
Fogg missed the China.
He can't possibly make it now.
- Are you sure?
- Positive.
Then I'll chance another couple of quid.
You take care of things while I slip round the corner.
Wait a minute.
Put down an extra fiver for me.
No, gentlemen, not a bit of activity all day.
There are just no odds on Mr. Fogg.
How can that be?
We could barely get in here last Thursday.
Yes, iùs very mysterious.
You never know from minute to minute.
I have just received some rather disquieting information about Mr. Fogg.
You know Mr. Carmichael, the General Manager of LloyÔs.
- This is Inspector Hunter of Scotland Yard.
- How do you do?
This will be very painful to hear, gentlemen.
We've just received confirmation of something we've suspected for some time.
The man who robbed the Bank of England, and your fellow clubman Phileas Fogg... are one and the same.
- Of all the ridiculous nonsense!
- You don't really believe that.
Have you any grounds for making this charge?
We have, sir. Some very striking facts.
Coupled with behavior that points to his guilt.
- I don't believe it.
- Nor do I.
You've heard that Mr. Fogg didn't sail on the Cunard steamship China.
- What of it?
- Read them that message, Mr. Carmichael.
"At 6:00 a.m. Today, our New York office reports...
"that trading ship Henrietta departed New York...
"with a cargo of cotton, linseed oil, and lumber.
"Her three passengers were
Mr. Phileas Fogg and party."
And the Henrietta's destination is Caracas, Venezuela.
We have no extradition treaty with Venezuela.
In other words, Mr. Fogg has bolted.
A member of the Reform Club...
My mind rejects the whole idea.
There must be some explanation for all this.
Perhaps, but the only man who can make it... is on the high seas at this moment, bound for Central America.
Begging your pardon, sir, we're way off course for Venezuela.
- Have you assumed command of this ship?
- No, sir.
Captain, don't overlook the rest of our bargain.
By all means. Go below and tell the engineer I want full steam.
- Full steam?
- Full steam. As much as she'll take.
You're burning her up too fast.
You'll never make it.
Just steer the ship, Captain.
Don't speculate.
Whaùs happening?
Why are we slowing down?
Well, thaùs it. They just put the last teaspoon of coal in the old scow.
Iùs all finished, Mr. Fogg.
Still got a little breeze left, but I don't think iùll get you there in time.
Only three more days to go.
I still can't believe that Fogg robbed the Bank of England.
No British gentleman, having done so... would have the effrontery to set foot in this club.
Capt. Speedy, I will be direct with you.
How much will you accept for this vessel, cash in hand?
- Why, this is exceptional...
£5,000? This deck is made of Burmese teak.
Please dispense with the poetry.
Passepartout, get the bag.
Yes, sir.
Will that be sufficient?
- She's yours!
- Done.
Now, as the new owner,
I wish to issue my first command.
Pile everything that will burn into the stoke hole.
The cargo first, of course, that linseed oil.
Then the upper decks, masts, tables, chairs, windows... ladders, everything, including the lifeboats.
- Is that clear?
- The lifeboats?
Lifeboats. You heard what the man said.
Is that clear?
Come on. Keep moving.
No, not her.
Not Henrietta!
Not her. No!
- The gauges are falling fast.
- There's nothing more to burn.
How are we faring?
The pressure won't last more than an hour.
- One hour?
- Thaùs right.
Engine room.
- Land ho!
- Land ho!
That was a close one. I never exactly made a voyage like this before...
- but I can't deny it, we got here.
- Thanks to you and your men.
After I put you ashore, where do you want me to dock?
Anywhere you wish.
I don't need her anymore, she's yours.
Thanks for the ship, whaùs left of it.
But you could rebuild...
You rebuild her.
I have more pressing matters.
Thank you very much.
My friends, the end of our journey is near.
Eight hours and 42 minutes of the allotted time remain.
Our train arrives in London at 6:02 p.m., ensuring ample time to proceed... to the Reform Club and settle the wager.
- Phileas Fogg! Stop that man!
- Don't delay, master. Come on.
- What the devil is this?
- Are you Phileas Fogg?
Of course I am. Are you insane?
- Then I arrest you in the Queen's name.
- Arrest? On what charge?
Of purloining £55,000 from the Bank of England... on the third of July.
- Iùs not true.
- Silence.
You thought you were clever,
Mr. Phileas Fogg.
Thought you could outwit me, didn't you?
Hold him.
Iùs not true, sir.
I can't understand it.
The most shocking mistake.
Iùs never happened in my career.
It would seem that I owe you an apology.
The most terrible thing has happened.
The real culprit was apprehended in Brighton.
I am no longer suspect?
No, not in the least, but I would like to tell you...
I've never had any personal animosity for you.
On the contrary, you've always been a perfect gentleman and most generous.
Iùs almost a pity that you're not the real robber.
You're so daring.
Now that you have successfully thwarted me... and placed in my path the only obstacle... which I could not make provision for...
I feel I can tell you I have never really enjoyed your company very much.
And furthermore, you play an abominable game of whist. Good day, sir.
The wager is lost. Come.
What a gloomy place.
So melancholy, so joyless.
I'm sorry, Mr. Fogg.
I didn't mean to criticize your taste.
No, you're right. It is depressing.
- Passepartout.
- Yes, sir?
Look at the clocks.
Get in touch with Mr. McMonnies and have them put in order.
- Right away, this morning.
- No, iùs Sunday today. Tomorrow.
Make up the spare bedroom for the princess.
Light a fire and see to her comforts.
Certainly, sir.
Madam, if you'll excuse me,
I'd like to spend the rest of the day alone.
- Passepartout.
- Yes, sir?
Turn out the gas in your room.
You needn't bother, Passepartout.
I'll take this up to him.
He won't eat, Madame.
He is feeling very low.
Poor man.
You know, his whole fortune, all that he risked... everything is lost.
- What will become of you?
- I can take care of myself.
After all, I have a dozen professions... fireman, acrobat, traveling companion.
You must eat something, Mr. Fogg.
- No, thank you.
- Please.
You're angry with me, and justly.
Good heavens.
Why should I be angry with you?
You might have won your wager but for me.
You saved my life at the risk of your own... generously, impulsively.
I repaid you by delaying you, involving you needlessly.
On the contrary, I owe you an apology for bringing you to England, penniless.
You must not concern yourself with me.
Anything that has overtaken me is a direct result of my own folly.
I refuse to deceive myself, and I don't like self-pity.
Possibly things aren't as desperate as they seem.
To be candid, at the moment they're not particularly promising.
- Surely your friends could aid you.
- I have no friends.
- Nor relatives?
- Not a soul.
Then I truly feel for you.
I know how tragic solitude can be...
when one has nobody with whom to share his grief,
In my country, Mr, Fogg, it is said that misfortune,,,
if shared with another sympathetic spirit, can be borne with resignation,
Do you wish at once a kinswoman and a friend?
I'm not sure that I interpret you correctly.
Will you have me for your wife?
Aouda, my darling,
Yes, sir? Yes, master?
I want you to go to Rev, Samuel Wilson,,,
of Marylebone Parish at once,
- Right away, sir.
- Arrange for a wedding,
- One wedding, sir. When?
- Tomorrow,
Will that be all right, my dear?
- Yes, tomorrow,
- OlÈ, sir!
Curtail the jubilation, please,
Bring the Reverend Wilson with you,
Yes, sir.
- Yes?
- A wedding. Come with me.
- No, I don't think so.
- Quickly. Iùs an emergency.
- I'll get my hat.
- Quickly.
Saturday.
Iùs Saturday.
And so many clocks.
Couldn't there be just one?
Anything you suggest, my dear.
How dare you bolt into a room in this fashion?
Where's your training?
And remove your hat.
Iùs not Sunday, iùs Saturday.
- We have 10 minutes left.
- What are you jabbering about?
Lùs Saturday! Look for yourself.
Fiddlesticks. The printers must have made an error.
- You have made error.
- We will review your impudence later.
Allow me to disillusion you.
I have kept a detailed record of every single phase of our entire trip.
We went around the world in 80 days, this is the 81...
Iùs Saturday.
We went eastward around the world, always moving towards the sun.
Great heavens.
We've crossed the International Date Line.
We've gained an entire day.
This is the eightieth day.
We have 10 minutes and 50 seconds left to get to the club.
You wait here, my dear.
Come, man, don't dawdle.
Cabby, Reform Club.
- Who?
- Reform Club.
Mind you, iùs none of my business... but do you think you'll get into the Reform Club dressed like that?
Drive on, man.
- Whaùs the matter? What happened?
- I'm sorry, sir. Iùs the hiccups.
I'm taken very bad.
I can't do a thing with them, sir.
- Blimey.
- Confound the man.
Iùs all right. I drive.
- Whaùs the matter with the beast?
- Iùs no good, sir. He can't do it.
He'd love to, but he can't.
He don't take orders from nobody but me.
- Come on, please.
- Iùs no good. He can't do it.
No, he won't do it.
The devil never sleeps, brethren.
Even now as we stand here... he is hurrying some poor soul to his doom... tempting him down the path of iniquity.
And now, I shall take up the collection.
Excuse me.
Sir, would you like to contribute something to our cause?
I don't think I have anything.
Wait. There's something.
- A fiver?
- Please, I'm in a hurry. Iùs a wager.
A wager? Did you hear that, brethren?
Our poor, benighted sinner is the very sort
I've been telling you about.
Don't do it, sir.
Don't give in to the Prince of Darkness.
- I haven't the faintest intention of giving...
- Have courage, my boy, to say no.
Turn to Hymn 579, everyone, and lift up your voices... to save our poorly beset brother.
Good heavens. Why wait any longer?
- He's lost the wager...
- Of course he has, 20 times over... once he missed his transatlantic connection.
Steady on, chaps. Play the game.
Remember, we're all British gentlemen.
- There's still 14 seconds to go.
- The man's not superhuman.
What do you expect him to do? Pop down the chimney like Santa Claus?
I haven't the least idea. I only know that Fogg is the most punctual man alive.
Gentlemen, here I am.
I trust that I've not kept you waiting.
Hello, Fogg.
Great Caesar's ghost!
A woman in the club!
My dear, I must ask you to leave these precincts at once.
- No woman has ever set foot in the club.
- Why not?
Because that could spell the end of the British Empire.
This is the end.

[Jackson] Major. Major Norton.
- Yes, sir?
- Where's that scout I told you to find?
They say the best man is one of the volunteers, Crockett.
- Where is he?
- Matter of fact, he's out hunting.
- Hunting?
- We need food. He's across the river.
That's enemy territory.
What you're short on is brains, not rations.
- He didn't take a gun, sir.
- I want this Crockett fellow now.
- Fetch him.
- Yes, sir.
[Norton] Crockett.
Crockett.
Davy Crockett.
Where's Crockett?
Speak up, man.
Where is he?
- [Growling]
- What's he doing in there?
He's tryin' to grin down a bear.
Grin down a...
You backwoods buffoons think the rest of us'll believe anything.
Crockett. Crockett, can't you hear me?
[Growling]
Come out of there.
I've got a message...
- [growling]
- [Grunting]
You sure spoiled things good.
Now I gotta do it the old-fashioned way.
Yee-haw. Give him what for, Davy.
[Crockett grunting]
Stick with him, Davy.
[Growling]
Now, Major, what was it you wanted to see me about?
[Panting] General Jackson wants to see you.
As soon as we get that bear pulled up.
It's a fair-to-middlin' size critter.
[Cheering, indistinct chatter]
Full bellies tonight, boys.
- I hear you want to see me, General.
- That's right. Come inside.
Now, how'd you kill that brute?
With my knife.
I was figurin' on grinnin' him to death, but this stumble-footed major busted my concentratin'.
Grinnin' him to death?
What in thunderation is that?
It's somethin' I've been experimentin' with.
You see, there's nothin' so absolutely unresistable as an old-fashioned, good-natured grin, like this.
I started on 'coons.
I got so good at it, an old 'coon throwed up his hands the minute he seen my teeth.
"You got me," he hollered and he skinned down that tree and plopped himself in my sack.
I figured the same thing ought to work on bears, but I never got a chance to find out.
The major come along and busted up my concentratin'.
I wound up havin' to wrestle this critter into table meat.
- Why was you hankerin' to see me?
- We're on the edge of enemy territory.
I want a scouting party to see what them redskins is up to.
Major Norton and a squad of regulars will accompany ya.
That wouldn't make the chore no easier.
Be sure the major brings back the information I want.
Come on, Major.
Some of your boys rode water pretty deep.
Better look to their powder.
Re-prime your pieces.
From here on, don't make no more noise. No talkin'.
Everybody keep close up.
Better stick closer to us, Major.
You've led us through swamps, canebrakes, and briar patches all day.
I see a trail and there's no sense in not taking it.
Has the general got your wife's address?
Take that trail and he's apt to write her a sad letter.
We're here to locate Indians and
I don't like the way you're doing it.
We'll cover more ground if we separate.
I'll take that trail.
We'll be back here in this clearing by dawn. See that you are.
Better fix up a signal to identify ourselves.
Can you do an old hoot owl?
Certainly.
[Hooting weakly]
That ought to fool the redskins just dandy.
[Laughing]
Come on.
[Davy] War party, a big one.
Here comes another bunch.
Head for cover.
[Speaking native language]
- That was Red Stick.
- What makes you so sure?
Creeks only got one young chief.
Gotta be him.
Let's leave the horses here.
[Chanting]
[Chanting, drums beating]
Looks like Red Stick's finally talked the tribe into listening.
I don't know what he said, but I sure don't like it.
I hope they keep that up a spell longer.
[Shouting, chanting]
We'd better get back to the major fast.
[Hooting]
[Hooting]
[Gunshots]
Everybody take cover.
Take cover, men.
Sounds like the major got himself in trouble.
- And we'll have to get him out.
- How?
- Surround 'em.
- Think there's enough of us?
We'll give 'em the ol' Crockett charge.
- [Crockett] Brigade, halt.
- [Russel] Company, halt.
Brigade... charge.
Company... charge.
It's the general and the whole regiment.
[Cheering]
All together now. Fire at will.
Charge. Yee-haw.
Advance on the line of skirmish.
Dragoons, dismount.
[Russel] Yippee. Yee-haw.
We got 'em on the run, men.
Company B, close up.
[Indistinct shouting]
Charge.
Charge.
[Russel shouting]
Company A reportin'.
[Russel] Here's the rest of us, Major.
Company B reportin'.
- You mean, just two of ya?
- Two was enough, wasn't it?
- These varmints were just a little party.
- The Creek nation is gatherin'.
Take care of your casualties.
We'll get the news to the general.
The general's expectin' me.
- Sorry to disturb you, General.
- Never mind. What did you find out?
They aim to fight.
They had a big war dance last night.
- Where?
- Back in the mountain.
Red Stick, sir.
Red Stick? I'd sure like to get my hooks on him.
We gotta move fast.
He's whippin' 'em up quick.
- Where's Major Norton?
- He had a little trouble.
Sentry.
What kind of trouble?
- Injun trouble, lost some men.
- Yes, sir?
Tell the sergeant major to order the camp struck.
- Lookouts are accounted for.
- Good.
When we catch Red Stick, this war will be over.
There's only two ways he can escape.
I got him stoppered.
As soon as the regulars are in position, jump in and stir up them red hornets.
[Yelling]
Give it to 'em, boys.
[Gunshots]
Fire and fall back.
[Shouting]
Fire.
Sound assembly.
[Bugle]
I reckon Red Stick's tomahawk's got an awful nick in it.
- Got away, didn't he?
- Yeah, but a lot of 'em didn't.
Much obliged for savin' my scalp.
Mrs. Crockett might have a kiss for ya when we get home.
- [Man #1] Feelin' better, boy?
- [Man #2] I'll make it.
- Don't call it a victory around me.
- Their casualties were enormous.
We captured three chiefs and they want to discuss terms for a peace.
- Peace?
- Excuse me.
- What do you want?
- Dropped in to say good-bye.
Good-bye?
Where do you think you're goin'?
Home.
You're going after Red Stick with the rest of my command.
We ain't quittin' the war.
We'll be back.
You see, General, we only volunteered for 60 days and that's long since up.
Catchin' Red Stick could take the rest of the year.
We gotta take care of our families before we start anything like that.
You're confined to this camp.
That's an order.
My missus'd worry about me.
Sorry, General.
If he leaves, it'll destroy the discipline of the whole camp.
- He's attached to your command, Major.
- Then I'm gonna stop him.
Halt.
- I'm warning you. Turn back.
- You know we're goin' home.
Prepare to fire.
Careful, don't burn yourself.
Bring us some bear meat when you come, Davy.
Sure. Anything you want, Major?
Blamedest bunch of volunteers
I ever saw.
When they volunteer to fight, they fight.
When they volunteer to go home, they go home.
# Off through the woods
He's a-marchin' along
# Makin' up yarns and a-singin' a song
Hey, Ma. Pa's back.
Davy, you're back.
- Hello, Pa.
- Hi, Pa.
Whee.
Well, reckon now's as good a time as any to collect what I got comin'.
Georgie Russel, what happened to you while you been gone?
Davy allowed as how I had a kiss comin' for savin' his life.
- He sure did.
- Well, in that case.
You ain't never gonna get a woman that way.
Reckon I gotta learn ya how.
Missed ya an awful lot.
Missed you too.
The young'uns like to pester me to death.
Not a mornin' passed they haven't said,
"Maybe Pa'll be home today."
But now, thank the good Lord you're home for good.
Well, not perzactly.
The war ain't quite over yet.
- You goin' back?
- Well, not for a few days.
Not 'til I get in a supply of meat for you and the young'uns this winter.
- You gonna be gone all winter?
- Well, I hope not.
- But I don't know how long it's gonna be.
- Oh, Davy.
Now don't take on. I had enough trouble with the Army over me comin' home.
My major and I didn't see quite eye to eye on it.
But I figured I was right.
And you know me.
When I'm sure I'm right, I go ahead.
# Headed back to war
From the ol' home place
# But Red Stick was leadin'
A merry chase
# Fightin' and burnin' at a devil's pace
# South through the swamps
On the Florida trace
# Davy, Davy Crockett
# Trackin' the redskins down #
- Halt. Who goes there?
- Just us, me and Davy.
How the devil did you find us way off down here?
You left a good trail: Army gear, lame horses, sick men all the way.
- That's us, all right.
- Reckon we better report to the general.
General Jackson ain't here.
He done been called to New Orleans.
- Who's in command?
- Major Norton.
If I'd knowed that,
I wouldn't have come back.
Let's get it over with.
I have to admit I'm glad to see you, Crockett.
You too, Russel.
I'm at my wit's end.
Most of my men have swamp fever.
I got a touch of it, too.
Still chasin' Red Stick?
It's a question of who's chasing who.
Every patrol I've sent out has failed to come back.
He can't have many warriors left.
If we could just locate them, but they can hide forever in this infernal swamp.
Me and Russel are rested up a mite.
It's only fair we take a cut at it.
No, no, that Indian has cost us enough lives already.
I refuse to let you two go out alone.
Looks like we'll have to start disobeyin' orders again.
Baby 'gators.
Kinda cute, ain't they?
I'm more scared of snakes and 'gators than I am of Injuns.
Two days old, maybe more.
Moccasins just about wore out.
Headin' around the lake.
Suppose we scout both sides, meet at the other end?
If you see any fresh sign, whistle like a thrush. Like a Tennessee thrush.
[Bird whistle]
[Bird whistle]
[Bird whistle]
[Speaking native language]
Where are others?
You not come alone.
I come alone.
Creek warriors. Hear me.
Any more of you varmints think I ain't worth listenin' to?
Speak, white man.
I ain't a soldier. I'm a settler.
- I'm a hunter like you.
- Hunter? You hunt Indians.
Only because you made war on us.
Your chiefs, the smart ones, have give up.
They've found out that war is no good.
White man talk.
War no good because soldiers all die.
How many Creek warriors have died?
How many women are crying for their men?
How many young'uns ain't got no fathers?
- You talk like woman.
- I'm talkin' sense and you know it.
You're brave, Red Stick, and your warriors is brave.
But in the end, they're all gonna die because you're a bad chief.
Because I take many white scalps?
Because soon I burn white man's friend?
No, Red Stick, because you could all go home in peace if you'd listen to reason.
But seein' as you won't,
I reckon I got to challenge you accordin' to Injun law.
- Injun law no good for white man.
- Why not?
White man's law would be good for Injun if you'd give it half a chance.
- How about it, Red Stick?
- Tomahawks.
[Cheering]
[Choking]
[Growling]
Well, it worked on a bear.
Ready to listen to reason now,
Red Stick?
I listen.
Turn my friend loose and lay down your arms.
Join the other chiefs in a treaty.
Do that and I promise the government'll let you live in peace on your own lands.
Promises no good.
White government lie.
Davy Crockett don't lie.
Here's my hand on it.
Why you no kill me?
Maybe because of another law.
We have trouble livin' up to it.
It ain't bad for red man or white man alike.
Thou shalt not kill.
[Speaks native language]
# Home for the winter with his family
# Happy as squirrels in the ol' gum tree
# 'Til spring set in and he started to be
# Restless for places he wanted to see
# Davy, Davy Crockett
# Itchin' to move again #
For folks who've said good-bye as many times as we have, it don't get easier.
I hope this is for the last time, Davy.
Now the Indian war's over, try and find a piece of land you'll be satisfied to settle down on.
I aim to, Polly. They say that new territory's a paradise.
Don't kill all the bears
'til we get there.
Guess I better get goin'.
- Keep your sights clean, fellas.
- You got plenty of time.
Yeah, there's gonna be a whole mess of kissin'.
You young'uns hold the fort down now.
Take care of yourself, Davy.
You take care of yourself too, Georgie.
When you get back, I suppose you'll have more outlandish songs about Davy.
Feel one comin' on right now.
# Lookin' for a place
Where the air smells clean
# Where the trees is tall
And the grass is green
# Where the fish is fat
In an untouched stream
# And the teemin' woods
Is a hunter's dream
# Davy, Davy Crockett
# Lookin' for paradise #
- You goin' any further?
- Not me. I like it fine right here.
[Mooing]
[Barking]
Hold on there, mister.
Who do we see about filin' a claim on some land?
Why, me. But you'll have to wait 'til after I judge a shootin' match.
A shootin' match? Any objection to a couple of strangers buyin' in?
Save your money.
You'll be shootin' against Big Foot Mason.
- Reckon we can risk a dollar?
- [Gunshot]
Sounds like they started without ya.
- You should have waited for me, Big Foot.
- You wasn't here.
Right in the notch, Big Foot.
- That's the last round. The beef's mine.
- Wait a minute.
This ain't fair judgin'.
Them's friends of yours.
Don't hear no complaints from the losers.
Hey, what do you figure that beef you won's worth?
$15 cash money, why?
Never went to a shootin' match without gettin' at least one shot off.
One shot it is.
Hey, Bruno, charge up my other rifle.
Give it two extra thimbles.
Take care of these cartwheels.
This time you do the judgin'.
Mighty fancy shootin' iron for this part of the woods.
Yeah, ain't it?
Dead center for Big Foot.
This one's dead center too.
You'll have to fire another round.
You was lucky.
Less'n a finger off the notch.
Better save your powder, stranger.
Why, he didn't even cut paper.
That'll take the turpentine out of your bark.
- I was a-fearin' you fired too fast.
- Let's take a look.
- He missed the whole blamed board.
- [Old man] I ain't so sure.
Looky here.
One bullet right on top of the other.
Yee-haw.
That's the kinda shootin' makes the ol' possum squeal.
Come on.
Here.
You're the first ones in over to them parts.
Nearest neighbor's a Cherokee, name of Charley Two Shirts.
Nice folks.
Thank you, Mr. Russel.
Davy Croc... you Davy Crockett?
- Why, sure.
- Davy Crockett.
No wonder you won Big Foot's beef away from him.
[Russel] Didn't seem too happy about it.
No, Big Foot ain't used to things goin' again' him.
Got folks pretty well buffaloed around here.
So I noticed.
We had the beginnin's of a decent community here, before him and his riffraff moved in.
- What are they doin' here?
- Nobody dares talk much about it.
They been runnin' the Injuns off their land, sellin' it to newcomers.
Government guarantees the Indians their lands by treaty.
Treaties don't mean nothin' to Big Foot.
- Why don't somebody stop him?
- Fella that was magistrate here tried.
Went over to serve a warrant on him.
Never come back.
He had the prettiest rifle ever seen in these parts.
Nobody knows what happened to him, but we know where his gun is.
Yeah, Big Foot was shootin' with it against Davy today.
That's right. Crockett, you're the only one
I know that could stand up to him.
Will you take on the job as magistrate?
- What would I have to do?
- Get us some law and order around here.
Well, I ain't crawfishin', but I kinda got my hands full.
We gotta finish our cabins, so I can bring my family.
It ain't no fit place for families as long as they're runnin' loose.
What do you say?
Well, take some thinkin'.
- I'm drier than a powder horn.
- Fetch me some too.
[Whistling]
Hey. This what stood your hair up?
[Speaking native language]
- I was sure I seen a man.
- Nobody's gonna hurt ya. Come on out.
Come out of there.
- Who are you?
- Charley Two Shirts.
- He's our neighbor.
- What happened to you?
Three white men come to my farm.
Tell Charley Two Shirts, "Get off."
I say, "This my land."
They say, "Indian got no land."
I show paper.
This land belong Cherokee.
They tear paper up, then Charley Two Shirts fight.
Reckon I'm gonna take on that job of magistrate right now.
Hey, Big Foot.
Lookin' for somebody?
Yeah, the man that run my friend here off his land.
I know who you are. Since when is Davy Crockett a friend of Injuns?
Always been a friend of the Cherokees.
Got no bones to pick with the others since we made peace.
This land's too good for Injuns.
I'm filin' on it.
No, ya ain't. Injuns got rights.
They're folks same as anybody else.
Take a powerful argument to convince me of that.
- That's what I come for.
- I've ate better men than you whole.
- How'll you have it, Big Foot?
- Rough and tumble. No holds barred.
Now ya got him, Big Foot.
Oh.
[Big Foot screams]
[Speaking Cherokee]
That goes for me too.
[Russel] Give him what for, Davy.
[Gunshot]
Get 'em, Charley.
Come on.
Get up. I said, get up.
- Much obliged, Charley.
- Come on, get goin'.
- What you aimin' to do to us?
- Me? Nothin'.
But you're gonna stand trial.
You two varmints got a lot to answer for.
Now get.
[Caller indistinct]
Davy Crockett.
- Howdy.
- Howdy.
- Howdy, Mr. Russel.
- Quite a frolic you got.
Ain't it?
Since Davy's been magistrate here, we can enjoy ourselves without it turnin' into a brawl.
I'll do the tradin' and meet ya out by the dance. Save a pretty girl for me.
Before that fiddle gets into your foot,
I got some tidings for ya.
Come over to my place.
I'll tell ya about it.
Folks around here is pretty proud of the job you done for us, Davy.
Since you got rid of Big Foot, honest settlers is movin' in.
There's so many of 'em we're gonna get us representation in Nashville.
That's what I want to talk to you about.
We held a meetin' last night to pick who we want to run for state legislature.
- You won hands down.
- [Chuckling]
Well, I'm plumb flutterated by the honor, but I ain't no politician.
You got the wrong bear up a tree, Judge.
Better get somebody more fittin'.
Like Amos Thorpe?
That lawyer who tried to get Big Foot off?
- You wouldn't run him?
- We wouldn't, but the opposition is.
Thorpe's got plenty of money to spend on a campaign.
Money he made off them Injun land grabs.
We figure you're the only man that's got a chance of beatin' him.
Will ya run again' him?
The way you put it,
I ain't got much choice.
[Cheering, applauding]
Hey, I got a letter for ya.
Be right back.
It's only a month old too.
This ain't Polly's hand.
It's mighty poor writin'.
See if you can make it out.
- From your sister-in-law.
- Why'd she be writin'?
"Dear Davy, I take my pen in hand to tell you some very sad news."
"Your beloved Polly was took... was took down with a fever and died in spite of all we could do.
The end was peaceful.
We buried her on the knoll near your cabin.
Don't worry about the boys.
They are living with us and getting along fine.
Little ones need a mother and already they seem like my own.
We know you are suffering the greatest loss a man can endure, but the good Lord knows best.
Your loving sister-in-law."
[Sigh] Wish there was somethin'
I could say, Davy.
Anything I could do?
Just give me some time by myself.
# Now he lost his love
And his grief was gall
# In his heart he wanted to
Leave it all
# And lose himself in the forest tall
# But he answered instead
To his country's call
# Davy, Davy Crockett
# Beginnin' his campaign #
Well, here it goes.
My honorable opponent knows
I ain't much shucks at speechifyin'.
Kind of him to let me speak first, so he can make a lie out of everything I say.
[Crowd laughing]
Truth is, I don't know nothing at all about politics. I'll leave that up to him.
But I do know the woods and the folks in 'em.
If you send me to Nashville,
I'll represent you as honest as I can.
Hooray for Davy.
I reckon that's all I got to say.
If this here speech seems a mite brief, looks like my worthy opponent's all set to make up for it.
If his speech is gonna be as dry as I think it is, maybe we better go over to the tavern and wet our whistles.
[Cheering] Come on, boys.
Voters of the sovereign state of Tennessee, I am well aware of the sacred responsibility you're about to bestow on me...
# Sent up to Nashville
The best they could find
# A fightin' spirit and a thinkin' mind
# Davy, Davy Crockett
# Choice of the whole frontier #
- Is Colonel Crockett at home?
- No, but I'm expectin' him directly.
I'm Tobias Norton.
He served under me in the Indian wars.
Would you like to wait in his room?
- You remember me, don't you?
- So you're Tobias Norton.
Never did know your first name, Major.
No rank any more, Davy.
I resigned from the Army three years ago.
- It's just plain Mr. Norton now.
- Sit down. What can I do for ya?
Just a sociable call.
I've been meaning to look you up.
Wish I could offer you something.
No, thanks. I never drink before sundown, Colonel.
I ain't rightly a colonel. That was in the militia, out in the canebrake.
We've watched your career in the legislature with a lot of interest.
- Just who's "we"?
- Why, General Jackson and myself.
As you may know, we're opening a political battle with the present administration.
We're going to make Andrew Jackson the next president of the United States.
I had a notion old hickory-face was travelin' along on his own shanks.
Well, everyone needs help, you know.
I'm sort of a campaign manager, unofficially of course.
Ever been out to the Hermitage?
No, but I sure heard about it.
I could get you an invitation.
The general would be glad to see you.
I'd admire that just fine.
- Howdy, General.
- Welcome, Crockett.
Come in. I'll be right down soon as I get my boots on.
Don't hurry, General.
Good afternoon, Mr. Crockett.
Take your hat, sir.
Glad you could come out, Crockett.
It's been a long time since we've seen each other.
You ain't changed, except you ain't so fearsome out of uniform.
And you ain't so gamey without your buckskins. Come on in.
Yes, everything's imported.
Except this.
Been savin' it for home folks.
Can't keep it in a decanter.
Eats the bottom out.
To your health, Crockett.
Here's somethin' else
I have to keep out of sight.
Exploits of Davy Crockett in the Rocky Mountains.
I ain't never been west of the muddy ol' Mississip. Let me see that.
Somebody's got a mighty powerful imagination.
"As told by his friend,
G.E. Russel."
Georgie Russel.
I might've knowed.
They're making you famous.
Next to me you're about the most famous man in Tennessee.
No wonder people's taken to pointin' me out.
It's not only these yarns.
You've made yourself quite a name in local politics.
Soap is only good for washin' dirty hands.
Well, it's a fact.
Now, you listen to me.
I'm going to run for president.
My enemies will lift my scalp if I get to Washington City.
I intend to take theirs first, if I can get the right kind of help.
Crockett, I want you to run for Congress.
Congress? General, you sure an old head wound didn't trouble you a little?
I mean it.
I want men I can trust.
Men I know are with me.
Men that can get the country behind me.
If I was to do what you asked and I did get in,
I wouldn't be takin' orders from you.
I'd be takin' 'em from them that elected me.
That's just the answer I hoped I'd get.
# The votes were counted
And he won hands down
# So they sent him off
To Washington town
# With his best dress suit
Still his buckskins brown
# A livin' legend
Of growin' renown
# Davy, Davy Crockett
# The canebrake Congressman #
Good mornin'.
Good mornin'.
Just a minute, Your Honor.
Hiya, Davy.
I wondered when you was gonna show up.
You ol' bear wrestler you.
How are you?
I put up with your singin' them lies about me, but printin' 'em is goin' too far.
- They helped put you here.
- Now I gotta live up to 'em.
You think I can go in dressed like a respectable congressman?
I gotta go like the King of the Wild Frontier, thanks to you.
That's ungrateful.
I come all the way from the Obion River, to wish ya luck on your maiden speech.
You just get yourself up in the gallery.
You're gonna hear a gullywhomper.
[Indistinct chatter]
[Gavel pounding]
Before we get to the order of business for the day, the chair will recognize the new gentleman from Tennessee, the honorable David Crockett.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen.
The fella around called a Master-At-Arms tells me a new congressman's supposed to make a speech.
Well, here she goes.
I'm David Crockett, fresh from the backwoods.
I'm half horse, half alligator and a little attached to a snappin' turtle.
[All chuckling]
I got the fastest horse, the prettiest sister, surest rifle and ugliest dog in Tennessee.
My father can lick any man in Kentucky, and I can lick my father.
I can hug a bear and eat any man opposed to Andy Jackson.
Some congressmen take pride in sayin' a lot about nothin', like I'm doin' right now.
Others don't do nothin' for their pay but just listen day in and day out.
I wish I may be shot if I don't do more than listen.
The next time I get up before ya,
I'll have somethin' to say worth sayin'.
Made yourself at home here.
Buildin' that stable for your racehorses?
Man's got to have a way to get his mind off his troubles.
This job's twice as tough as fighting Injuns and ain't half the fun.
I know what you mean.
More government business is done at fancy dress balls than on the floor of Congress.
A man's got to skin the cat any way he can. You know that.
What's important is keepin' men like you behind me, solid.
You put a strain on a fella sometimes,
Mr. President.
You're bound to make mistakes, and you've made some humdingers.
Davy, the President can't think of just one group.
We're growing too fast.
There's nearly 13 million of us now.
We're bustin' at the seams.
We need room to grow.
Expansion.
That's what I'm thinkin' of.
And by the eternal, I'll not let anything stand in the way of that.
Good morning, Congressman.
I'd like to speak to you a moment.
I see ya ain't combed all the nits out of your hair, Davy.
Norton's changed.
He's been a lot of help to me.
I was planning to see you later.
How long have you been in town, Russel?
I've arranged for you to do a speaking tour of the big Eastern cities.
- I got work to do.
- That can wait. This is more important.
You're the logical choice.
- Now, hold on. Why me?
- You've become a national figure.
Everybody's heard of you and wants to see you.
- You can do a service for the country.
- By tellin' backwoods jokes?
I'm serious, Davy.
This tour is an opportunity.
You've got to think ahead.
Jackson's in his second term.
In three years, they'll be electing a new president.
And some of us have been seriously considering you.
Under the circumstances, you can't afford to pass this up.
- Is it convenient to leave Sunday?
- Well...
- I guess so.
- I'll arrange your passage.
I enjoyed talking to you, Russel.
Davy, you used to have a motto.
"Be sure you're right, and then go ahead."
Well, I sure hope you're right.
# Him and his jokes traveled
All through the land
# His speeches made him friends
To beat the band
# His politickin'
Was their favorite brand
# And everyone wanted
To shake his hand
# Davy, Davy Crockett
# Helpin' his legend grow #
Citizens of Philadelphia, this here's the most beautiful rifle gun
I ever hope to see.
She's so pretty, I'll give her a name.
Betsy suit you folks?
Now you all heard about me baggin'
105 bears in one winter.
Betsy here ain't gonna come to no such use.
I don't get no joy out of killin' critters like that no more.
Why, the last bear I treed
I brung home alive.
We tamed him and now he sits at the table like a man.
Named him Death Hug.
I wouldn't wonder if he was smart enough to travel and maybe go to Congress.
[All laughing]
Now, I hate long-winded speeches and this one's long enough.
I'll always treasure this here testimony of your friendship.
With a gun like this a man could put a rifle ball through the moon.
First chance I get, I'm gonna try it.
Thank you.
What sliver's under your toenail?
Remember you tellin' me how helpful Norton was?
He helped you out of Washington
'cause you was in the way.
- Of what?
- The President's Injun bill.
- That's not on the floor.
- It's in debate now.
What?
Couple of your friends are tryin' to stall, but no tellin' how long they can hold out.
Looks like my tour's over now.
How's the quickest way back?
- Way I come, in the saddle.
- I know where we can get fresh horses.
Haven't you been able to force the vote yet?
The opposition won't yield the floor.
Get them to call that vote.
- I didn't expect you back for a week.
- I know.
If you're worried about the Indian bill, it's over. They've passed it.
They'll have to change their minds.
I'm warning you. Go in there and you commit political suicide.
Know what I think about your politics?
I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee.
Mr. Speaker, fellow members of the Congress of these United States,
I've stood before you a good many times in fights and fun.
We've had a laugh for the country and our own digestion.
But you can fold up your grins and put 'em away, for you'll hear no jokes from Davy Crockett today.
You have before you somethin' called an Indian bill.
I don't aim to keep you here much longer arguing.
You've had enough of that.
But before it comes to a vote,
I want to remind you of something.
Expansion is a mighty fine thing.
Sure, we gotta grow.
But not at the expense of the things this country was founded to protect.
The government's promises in the treaties is as sacred as your own word.
Expansion's no excuse for persecutin' a whole part of our people because their skins are red and they're uneducated to our ways.
You wouldn't be doin' the settlers no good votin' for this bill.
You'd only be makin' rich men out of the land grabbers tryin' to get it passed.
Now, just who are these scalawags?
One of 'em could be the President, usin' this Congress for his own purpose.
But I've known General Jackson for half of my born life, and I'm sure he's got nothin' but the good of the country at heart.
No, it's just a few thievin' varmints hangin' on by givin' dinners and parties, reachin' for whatever they can get a hold of.
But they're a no-count lot,
'bout as natural as flies around molasses.
The real scalawags in this capitol of the brave and free is us, you and me.
I'm the worst of the lot. Reckon I've missed as many sessions as any of you.
Out shootin' my mouth off when I should have been here.
It's nobody's fault but our own if a bill like this gets passed.
We got a responsibility to this strappin', fun-lovin' young bear cub of a country.
We got a responsibility to help it grow into the kind of nation the Lord meant it to be.
If we showed we were the men our friends figured we was when they sent us here, a bill like this would never live long enough to even get on our desks, let alone come to a vote.
# He knew when he spoke
His career was done
# But he spoke out strong
And his point he won
# Then packed his gear
And his trusty gun
# And lit out a-grinnin'
To follow the sun
# Davy, Davy Crockett
# Hittin' the trail again #
Oh, there you are.
Hey, Davy... ain't you gonna get no sleep?
- I've been doin' some thinkin'.
- Me too.
We're pretty far downriver.
Ain't it time we decided where we're goin'?
- Always have had a good idea.
- Where?
"Texas independence threatened."
"General Santa Ana vows to expel settlers."
Texas?
We got the whole country to choose from, and you gotta pick...
- Nothin' there but a mess of trouble.
- Americans in trouble.
A bunch of crazy fools tryin' to take on a whole army.
They're so far away from the rest of the country, they know they won't get help.
A bunch of rock-headed idiots that won't quit because they think they're right.
How soon you reckon we'll be headed out that way?
Right after we get to Little Rock.
A magnificent birthright, flung willfully into the gutter.
A superb inheritance of mind and body, squandered recklessly in the muck of the common herd.
Talents dissipated, courage abandoned, character destroyed.
Gentlemen, the very one for whom I've been waiting.
'Tis truly written,
"Hope springs eternal."
I've been thinking I might yet find redemption in the company of some peerless paragon of manhood and virtue such as yourself.
You too, of course.
In other words, you want
Davy to be your backbone.
Backbone?
That's putting it rather bluntly, sir.
I am offering the Colonel my incomparable companionship.
Me and Russel are figurin' on headin' down Texas way.
That ain't no place for a riverboat gambler with wobbly knees.
There are times when cowardice is a virtue, my dear Colonel.
It makes choosing a course simple.
I know nothing of this Texas, but I do know the fury of the outraged minions of the law, and as a consequence,
I fear what lies behind me far more than the unknown, which lies ahead.
Surely, you'll not deny me the pleasure of your illustrious company.
Look, in the mornin' don't forget this was your idea.
# He heard of Houston
And Austin and so
# To the Texas plains
He just had to go
# Where land was free
And there was room to grow
# And freedom was fightin'
Another foe
# Davy, Davy Crockett
# King of the wild frontier #
Well, there she is.
[Davy] Texas.
There's room out there for every dream I ever had.
Yeah, there's room, all right.
Too much of it.
A desolate, desiccated desert, untouched by the hand of man and God alike.
Well, there's somebody around, and they know we're here.
- Indians?
- Probably Comanches.
You mean, that barbaric horde they call the Cossacks of the Plains?
Same critters.
We better be gettin' out of here.
[Low rumble]
Whoa.
- What unearthly manifestation is that?
- Supposin' we find out.
[Davy] There's your Comanches.
That's what stampeded 'em.
He's crazy. He's headed into that prairie dog town.
Don't just stand there.
Give me a hand.
Bite off more than you could chew?
He might not look it, but he's a powerful lot of Indian.
If we can patch him up, he'll make us a good guide.
I can hardly wait to sink my teeth in this buffalo meat.
- Your friend's awake.
- [Davy] Good.
Think I'll have a palaver with him.
Can the Colonel actually converse with that aborigine?
Watch.
He's tellin' Davy about himself but I can't get it all.
Near as I can make out, this Indian's had a hard time.
He's been on many war parties and never got a scalp.
The medicine man took his squaw and kicked him out of the tribe.
On top of that, his pony fell and he lost a buffalo.
With all his busted luck, sure you want him for a guide?
Lucky we ran into him. If we'd have kept on goin', we'd have lost our hair.
Lost our hair?
Mmm, smells good.
Says he's willin' to lead us to a white settlement.
I, for one, do not trust that perfidious savage.
You better trust him. He's the only one that knows the trail to the next water hole.
Mornin'.
There's a settlement of Texans down this way. Know where it is?
- You mean San Antonio de Mexar?
- Yeah, that's her, San Antone.
It is not safe to go over there.
General Santa Ana has already taken Mexar.
If he's taken the town, where are the Texans?
In the Alamo, an old mission across the river.
- We got here a mite late.
- Let's see if we can make up for it.
You must not go there. The Alamo has been surrounded by a big army, and there's many patrols all over.
We got through Injun country without trouble.
Company, forward.
[Speaking Spanish]
- They don't look very friendly.
- Let's get.
[Gunshots]
[Rifle shots]
[Distant gunshots]
Cover 'em.
- That was a tight squeeze. You all right?
- I reckon.
- You in command?
- I'm second.
- Col. Bowie's commander.
- The fella who invented the knife?
That's him. Come on.
He's been laid up. He took a fall helping us mount the cannon.
The fever's been giving him the devil ever since.
Colonel, we have more reinforcements.
- I'll see your men are taken care of.
- Thank you.
- Colonel Bowie?
- Yeah.
I brought a company in and wanted to report.
I'm Davy Crockett from Tennessee.
Davy Crockett.
I should've known.
By God, I never hoped to see you in this neck of the woods. Sit down.
[Coughs] I can't get rid of this cough.
- Tell me. How many men did you bring?
- Four, includin' myself.
Four?
Two acres of wall to defend.
It'd take 1,000 troops to man this garrison adequately.
I've got less than 200 volunteers.
200 stubborn men can do a lot of fightin'.
Crockett, I'm gonna be honest with you.
This miserable excuse of a fort is our last chance.
If we can't hold Santa Ana until Houston reorganizes our army, Texas is lost.
Well, we'll just have to hold her.
Right.
I want to tell you what we're up against.
We're practically encircled.
On top of that, we don't have enough rations left for a good-sized family dinner.
Powder? There's about enough left for a turkey shoot.
None of this goes outside this room.
Sure, Colonel. These 200 you got, ain't there any more Texans around?
We've been sending messengers out.
One did get back from Gonzales with 32 men.
There's a fair-sized force at Goliad.
We sent a courier a few days ago.
- But I don't think he made it.
- I'll take a crack at gettin' through.
No, we need your breed of men here.
Half horse, half alligator.
The amount of powder in the gun's not near as important as the spirit of the men behind the sights.
Half any battle's knowing you'll win.
Crockett, for the first time since
I've been here, I believe we can hold out.
With old Betsy here, and this here
Arkansas toothpick of yourn, how can we lose?
Look at that camp. Every morning there's twice as many as the night before.
I bet there's 2,000 of them.
Why did Santa Ana call that truce, sent for that messenger?
[Russel] Whatever it is, it ain't good.
With His Excellency's compliments.
Crockett, come down here.
Listen to this, Colonel.
[In Spanish]
It's so flowery, it must've been written by some other attorney.
Roughly translated, it means we surrender on his terms or...
- I ain't much authority on surrenderin'.
- Neither am I.
Moriarty.
His Excellency's offered to let us surrender.
He's waitin' for an answer.
Let's give it to him. Fire in the hole!
Hit the dust.
They say that war is the most exalted experience a man can endure.
To me, it's the most miserable and untheatrical method of suicide.
Shelled us all night and all day, ain't hit a man yet.
You ain't got nothin' to worry about.
Ain't nobody gonna hit you.
You're too shifty.
You volunteers better get food and rest while you can.
Sorry, no rest for the gunners and officers.
Go get some food.
You too.
Take your relief, men.
I'll get yours for you, Davy.
Some of the boys are gettin' worn pretty thin.
Four days and no casualties yet.
Incredible.
How much longer will our luck hold up?
This ain't luck.
It's the hand of Providence.
- You really believe that?
- I sure do.
So do I, Davy.
You call that a serving?
It's difficult to maintain manly courage on this provender.
Would you care to tempt lady luck, double or nothing?
Why not?
My stomach sure ain't gonna miss this.
You hold the stakes, Busted Luck.
Come, my sporting friend.
We'll venture our fortunes with the elusive pea.
Neither voodoo, hoodoo nor Hindu.
Prestidigitation, an old and honorable art.
Now you see it, now you don't.
Choose.
Oh, you'd risk your pittance of food for a chance of a full belly?
Very well, my hungry aborigine, since you thrust the wager upon me...
Choose.
There.
- How ya doin'?
- Keepin' awake.
I just found out somethin'.
We're sittin' here like a bunch of treed possums.
We're about out of ammunition.
There's no help comin'.
I knowed that since the day we got here.
We're still holdin' out.
Since the day we...
You knowed it since then?
Colonel asked me not to say anything.
You knowed and you couldn't trust me, after all the tight ones we've been through?
I thought we was in this together.
We're both wore out.
Go get some sleep.
All right. From now on, it's every man for hisself.
- What do you want?
- I had to see you.
Was it necessary to wake me up?
I ain't scared of fightin', but this is gonna be a massacre.
- Not if we get help from Goliad.
- But you ain't got it.
You ain't got no way of tellin' unless you get a messenger through.
You think you can make it?
I've been in and out of bear traps all my life. I ain't lost no toes yet.
- When do you want to try?
- Right now.
I'll have the Colonel's horse saddled up.
Good. Now, how do I get to this Goliad town?
That's a good question.
Here's a drainage ditch, sort of a sunken road.
If the moon's behind a cloud and the sentries are asleep, and if you have more luck than one man's entitled to, you might get through their lines here.
- Why, that man's deserting.
- Deserting?
That's Russel trying to make it to Goliad for help.
Russel?
If you're worrying about Russel, don't.
He's only been gone two days.
It's nearly 100 miles to Goliad.
- Couldn't make it back, then.
- Not yet. He'd have to wait for darkness.
[Explosion]
- There she is.
- Gun crew, over there in that draw.
Save the big pop gun.
It eats too much powder.
They ain't as far off as they think they are, are they?
Obligin' of 'em to move in so close.
Moriarty, hold it.
- Leave a mite too much windage.
- Raise my sights a mite.
Guess you boys haven't had enough practice.
He says old Betsy'll reach.
[Cheering]
That's more like it.
Hey, it's Russel.
- Open the gates.
- [Rifle shots]
- How many men will they send us?
- They can't spare us none.
You eternal idiot.
You was safe, in the clear.
- What'd you come back for?
- Just got lonesome, I reckon.
Notched you up like an ol' razorback.
They can't shoot for sour apples.
We won't get any help from Goliad.
I can't keep this from my men any longer.
Break it to Colonel Bowie.
Have him move to a room in the chapel where there's more protection.
[Gunfire]
Oh, it's you, Davy.
Mighty good of you to keep lookin' in on me.
When a man's laid up, he gets tired of his own company.
I'm glad to see a friend's face.
Friends for less than a week.
Pity we didn't meet before.
Russel made it back from Goliad.
Tell me, did he...
No help.
I brought those men in here.
Reckon I better be with 'em now.
Take it easy, Colonel.
I'll get you outside.
Hornbuckle. Contreras.
Move the Colonel outside.
I've called you all together because it's time you knew the truth.
Russel brings bad news, men.
The defense of the Alamo rests on us alone.
General Santa Ana has nearly
5,000 men massed against us.
I can't force you beyond patriotism and your own conscience.
While it's still dark, there's time to slip off to safety.
I won't blame any man who doesn't stay.
Those who stay, cross over the line.
Boys, I don't think
I can make it myself.
I'd appreciate it if some of you would help me across.
Thank you, men.
- It's been a long time for us, Georgie.
- Yeah, a lot of years.
A lot of things to remember.
Play us a little tune.
Why don't you play one, Davy?
That piece you made up when we was leavin' the green hills of Tennessee.
- Figured you'd remember that 'un.
- Yeah, it's the only one you ever writ.
Fellas like it too.
# Farewell to the mountains
# Whose mazes to me
# Were more beautiful far
# Than Eden could be
# The home I redeemed
# From the savage and wild
# The home I have loved
# As a father his child
# The wife of my bosom
# Farewell to ye all
# In the land of the stranger
# I rise
# Or I fall
# Farewell to the mountains
# Whose mazes to me
# More beautiful far
# Than Eden could be
# The home I redeemed
# From the savage and wild
# The home I have loved
# As a father his child
# The wife of my bosom
# Farewell to ye all
# In the land of the stranger
# I rise
# Or I fall #
Hadn't you better get a little rest?
It's a capital idea.
It may be our last.
They're on us.
Here they come. Wake up, men.
On your feet.
[Military bugle call]
Ya-hoo. We're holdin' 'em.
Colonel, what's that bugle call they were playin'?
That's their signal for no quarter.
Yeah?
Well, they'll be playin' that again.
Here they come.
They've breached the north wall.
Let's swing the cannon.
Come on.
Fire in the hole!
Give 'em what for, Davy.
# Storybooks tell
They was all cut low
# But the truth of it is
This just ain't so
# Their spirits'll live
And their legends grow
# As long as we remember
The Alamo
# Davy, Davy Crockett
# Fightin' for liberty #

Jiro!
Come!
Ah, my sister is calling us.
Are we all here? Where's Jiro?
Let's eat!
Take that.
Well, that was a good meal.
Yes, Jiro, you can eat.
Sasuke, Sasuke, see them.
Oh, an eagle took the fawn.
Wait!
I told you to wait.
Dear brother, what you saw was a witch ...
It is said that many years ago, when Japan was a bright new country, there was a bad witch, envious and greedy, who wanted to take away all the pleasures of the Japanese people.
The witch cast magical spells over them, and made them suffer.
But there was a great Japanese king then, who knew magic too ... and he heard of the evil she was doing.
He came to the forest where she was, and punished her.
She was transformed into a small salamander.
Years passed and the king who knew the magic died.
She's transformed back ino her former self, and now has returned to make the innocent suffer.
Her name is Yasha, the evil Princess.
Sister, I want to learn magic.
You'll see how I defeat her.
- You're just a kid
- What? We must fight against the witch.
Sasuke, I know what you feel but can't you wait until you're a little older ... won't you?
Tinkerbell!
Tinkerbell, go back home.
Tinkerbell, go back!
Do you understand what I said?
Hold my stick.
But it's' Tinkerbell ... At this hour?
What's this?
Dear sister,
I am going to learn magic.
Do not worry about me,
I love you. Sasuke
Sasuke... Sasuke
Sasuke... Sasuke
Oh Tinkerbell, his staff ...
What do we do? If it's gone we can not stop ...
God, please protect my little brother and guide him in everything.
Oh ... Who's' been?
My name is Sasuke.
Who are you?
How do you say? I am Genroku, the most terrible bandit in Japan.
A bandit? And why don't you work like the other people?
Work? Ah ah ah!
Come here, I will give you a lesson.
Come on, Genroku.
You think you're very smart?
Take that!
Take that!
Failure.
What's up, Genroku?
Work for me and obey me.
Get up!
Are you okay? Boy, I have not seen you at your house and you leave your sister alone.
Boy, I watched you walk away from your house and you left your sister alone.
Who told you who I am?
- I know you well.
- Really?
On top of this mountain lives a hermit and he is the only one who can teach the magic that you want to learn.
But the mountain is higher than you can climb, kid.
I'll climb it, find the hermit and I'll learn the magic ...
But you ... Where has he gone?
- Are you the hermit?
- Yes, Sasuke. You are very brave.
- And you, how did you climb up here?
- Sasuke, you'll stay here with me
- and I'll teach you magic.
- Really?
- Yes, Sasuke, you deserve to know my secrets because you're brave and courageous.
- Shall we start now?
- Yes, I want to help.
You will do what I say.
Very good ... Sasuke, you think you are strong enough?
- Yes.
- And then tomorrow you will fill them.
You must be careful ... What would you do if the witch takes you by surprise?
Stay alert, always remember what
I tell you ... Stay alert.
- Well, always alert.
- The boy will learn.
You have to leave
Tinkerbell all the work ...
I'm going to learn magic.
Take that, take that!
Take that, take that!
Take that, take that!
Take that!
Take that!
It's too early to say. Another time ...
Are you ready?
Take that!
- Here I am.
- Good.
Tell me Sasuke, do you miss your home?
- No. .. A little.
- I know, Sasuke. But not missing it much.
Well ... Look, sir: what's this?
I think it's a fire, Sasuke.
The bandits are coming and setting fire to everything they encounter.
- Bandits, sir?
- You'll find bad people wherever you go.
Hurry!
That's all, let's go!
- Wait.
- And now what's that?
We enter here.
Hey ... Thieves!
Hurry ... Come on!
Prince Yukimura ... Lord, the bandits burned the city.
What? Get the horses.
Where are you going, child?
Do not leave me, wait!
Prince Yukimura ... Let's go!
Run away!
Friends, I promise: the bandits will repent of this.
Hey, wake up, eat this and then return home.
No, bandits, I'm not going home without my trunk, get it?
You want your trunk back?
Nothing to be done.
Listen, baby, here the boss is Yasha, a bad Princess and ugly witch.
What kind of bandits are these, if they are controlled by a woman?
Genroku, Prince Yukimura will attack if he finds us here.
I hope you have a sufficient number of guards.
Well, I think ...
- Idiot, Go.
Please be a good girl ... If Yasha sees you here, she'll have us killed, please go away.
I don't care, I'm not going without my trunk.
Where are you all?
Guards!
Guards!
Where have they got to?
Here we are ... What a beautiful day.
We were on the job.
And you would be the guards?
What were you doing?
- Uh, nothing, sir. Really.
- Nothing, sir.
Prince Yukimura wants to attack us.
If you are not alert, I'll have your heads.
Boss, you can count on us.
Enough! To your positions!
Master, isn't she beautiful for a country girl?
Excuse me, Miss, I want to know something
...  are the bandits gone from here?
You see before you Prince Yukimura, and
I am his servant.
We traveled a long way today and we want a little refreshment,if it's possible.
Certainly, but my home is a humble one.
Come.
Bandits live in the mountains there.
Perhaps those are the ones you are looking for.
These are delicious.
- I understand ... And where is Sasuke?
- Oh prince, he's been missing for 3 years and I wonder where he is.
Sasuke, each time you become better.
Now try again.
All right, Sasuke. Ready?
Forgive me, I made a mistake.
Do not worry, kid.
Soon you'll be an expert.
I want to help. If one day you need me, let me know.
- Thank you.
- We'll meet again.
Farewell, prince.
- Yasha, I have news.
- Be quiet, don't you see you're interrupting my dance?
Yes, but this is most important.
The guards saw the prince.
What? Where?
He's in a house with a beautiful girl.
With a beautiful girl?
Why didn't you tell me before?
Because I didn't know myself..
The guards overheard them while they were talking about her brother.
- He has learned magic.
- Magic?
And I suppose you did not find out his name ...
His name is Sasuke.
Sasuke?
But he's just a child.
And you, why are you laughing?
Genroku, I order you and your men to kill this Sasuke who knows magic.
Prince Yukimura and the girl: not a word more, understand?
Move!
- I ask that you kill them all.
- All right.
- Are you ready? Ready to go?
- Yes.
What is happening?
Oh, no ... This way.
- Where is the girl?
- Over there.
After them!
Where did they go?
Where are they?
Sasuke!
- You called me, sir?
- Yes, Sasuke.
It's been some time since you came here, boy.
Sasuke, this will be your first test of your powers.
- Yes?
- I have taught you everything I know.
Go, now! And remember to always have trust in yourself.
Girl, you gotta get away, we can't hide you any more.
- No.
- All the pretty girls are going to be killed.
I? Ah, I see. You want to save me because I'm pretty.
Oh no, now she thinks she's pretty.
Please, girl.
I'm saying to you please.
For the last time, if you don't go now ... Ouch!
If you don't go now, we'll throw you off this cliff.
Ha ha, I'm not afraid. I dare you.
- Oh, what do we do now?
- I don't know.
- What do you think? Throw her?
- Maybe it 's the best thing to do.
- Eh? What are you doing?
- You will see.
- Why?
- Why? Because you won't go home.
- This will hurt us more than it hurts you.
- You don't have to do it.
You hit me.
Ah, what are you doing?
It hurts.
- All right ... I think you're safe now.
- Thank you.
- Ah, you scared me ... Who are you?
- I am Sasuke, the best magician in all of Japan.
- Are you really?
- Right now no. Maybe one day I will be.
Sure, when you're bigger.
Now you're a boy ... Ha, ha.
Sasuke, the bandits stole my trunk.
You can get it back with magic?
You said bandits?
Sure.
- Sure, as soon as I've seen my sister.
- Sister? You have a sister?
- Yes, I have not seen her for a long time.
- Really?
- Can I come to meet her?
- Sure you can come.
- Thank you.
- Not at all.
Is it much further?
Sasuke, I'm tired.
No, it's just up the road.
Forward.
Sister!
Sister! Sister!
Sister!
Sister!
Tinkerbell! Where's my sister?
- Sasuke!
- Sister!
Sasuke...
I am very happy to see you.
I missed you a lot.
I missed you a lot too.
We need help, please go to the Prince Yukimura.
Okay.
Open up!
My name is Sasuke and
I want to speak with the prince.
What are you asking?
Who do you think you are, boy?
- Get out of my way.
- You shameless brat, I'll show you.
Where is he?
Thank you, guard.
It was easy to enter.
Guard, what's going on here?
A boy was flying there.
You're right, I must raise the alarm.
Who's there?
You must be Sasuke!
- Sasuke, I'm happy to see you.
- And you are very careful, prince.
Yes, you're very careful
... and my sister thinks you are perfect.
How's your sister?
Is there any news?
She has had a terrible time.
The bandits have burned our house ...
- ..and she had to hide otherwise they'd have killed her.
- What? Bandits?
Master, a boy has got in and is somewhere in the palace.
- I'm looking for him now.
- Wait, the one you are looking for is here.
It's the brother of that beautiful girl.
The bandits wanted to kill her.
What? Kill that beautiful girl?
We will leave at once!
Attack!
- Bandits!
- Quiet! Princess Yasha wants to see you.
No, no, no!
My sister's comb.
Sasuke, there's no time to lose.
You are Sasuke's sister, eh?
I hate beauty.
I want to disfigure you, my dear.
Sasuke, go behind the mountain.
I'll go 'this way.
All right.
- Sasuke, I can go with you?
- You stay here.
- Why  not?
- Ah, ah, wait here until you see our signal to you.
- We need your help here.
- Sure, you can give orders to our new friends.
Can I give the orders?
Okay, I'll wait here.
- Halt!
- Goodbye.
- No mercy for them, understand?
- Understood.
I can't bear this waiting.
Follow me.
- Where is he?
- Here.
Stand and fight.
- They're coming.
- Ha ha, we'll prepare a nice welcome.
- You know what to do with the girl ... right, Genroku?
- Yes, Your Highness.
And now tell me where my sister is.
Otherwise ... One, two ...
- Stop, she's in the house of the witch.
- Yes, in the witch's house.
I've been waiting for you.
Well, where is my sister?
Want to know?
- See for yourself ... Genroku!
- Yes.
- Sister!
- Oh, Sasuke.
- Cowards.
- Sasuke, you challenge me?
Then your sister will die.
You see, Sasuke, you can not defy me now, can you?
Sasuke.
- Genroku!
- Oh, that brat. I want to teach him a lesson.
Cut the rope!
Come on, help me to take it.
Help me.
That's it... friend ... That's it.
Hold on! I will save you.
Sasuke, how can I thank you?
You killed the evil princess.
You are a brave boy, I need someone like you.
Will you come to serve me in the palace?
Yes, Your Highness. That would be a pleasure.
Let's go!

Hey.
Hey, push me again.
- See?
- Let me try.
See?
You're no good.
What's wrong?
Come on.
Hurry up.
Mrs Okubo?
Hi. Thanks.
- Here it is.
- Thanks so much.
That spinach looks good.
It's very expensive. 20 yen.
- I can't even afford spinach now.
- I know.
Listen.
I heard something strange.
Our dues weren't paid.
But we paid.
I know, but I ran into the chairwoman.
She said we haven't paid our dues.
But I paid.
So did I.
It doesn't make sense, then.
I know.
- Although...
- What?
She did just buy a washing machine.
Yes, but in instalments.
But isn't it strange about our dues?
Mrs Okubo?
- That's her.
- Yes?
- Here's the women's bulletin board.
- Thank you.
Back already? You're early.
What's wrong?
I'm back.
Where are you going? Not next door, I hope.
No, I'm going to study.
He's crazy about television.
- Sumo wrestling season?
- Yes.
Listen.
What happened the other day?
- It's very strange.
- Why?
I'll go over first, Kouzou.
Please get me another pair of pants, Mum.
What's the matter? Diarrhoea?
Why do you soil your pants?
You do it every day.
I didn't buy a washing machine just for your pants.
Mum, please give me a clean pair of pants.
Watching wrestling is okay, but they never learn anything worthwhile over there.
That figures.
We really shouldn't associate with them.
That couple is in their pyjamas all day long.
She used to work in a cabaret.
So she's that kind of woman, is she?
- I should be going.
- Of course.
How much is the sauce, though?
Don't worry about it. I owe you money, too.
- Thanks.
- See you later.
Hi.
Hi. Come on in.
- Is Minoru here yet?
- Not yet.
Hailing from Hokkaido, Kitabayama is known
for his assiduous wrestling style.
To his right is Komaki from Yamagata.
Wakanohana's looking good today.
Who do you think will win?
That's easy. Isn't it?
Sure. He's got a great throw.
That's true.
Have some.
It's time to go.
Isn't your friend from next door coming?
Should we call him?
- Minoru!
- Minoru!
- Come on.
- What's the matter? Hurry up.
- I'm going.
- I'm going.
Where are you going?
To study English.
- Isamu, too?
- Yes.
You're not watching TV again, are you?
Don't go next door.
Foolish boys.
Mrs Hayashi?
I need to ask you something.
This might seem like a strange question, but did you give our dues to the chairwoman?
Yes, about 10 days ago.
I see. I thought so.
But she says she hasn't received them yet.
Really?
Not only that, but Mrs Haraguchi just bought a washing machine.
But she wouldn't...
I know. But Mrs Okubo says she gave the dues to you.
Yes, she did. Shall I ask the chairwoman?
But if she says she hasn't received them yet...
I did give them to her.
Of course you did.
You wouldn't forget something like that.
How could this have happened?
This is so distressing.
Here is our hero, Wakahichibu.
He's tossing salt around the ring.
And here is his opponent in this title match.
Wakashichibu is...
What are you doing?
You're here again, Kouzou?
Don't you ever listen?
Hello.
I'm sorry my son's always bothering you.
What about your English lessons?
Minoru's here, too?
And your mother will scold you, too, Zen.
It must be such a nuisance for you.
I don't mind.
All right, it's time to go home. Come on.
I'm not going. I'm done studying.
What? I'll tell your mother. Come on.
Have a good evening.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Tell your teacher "hello" from big sister.
Big sister? You mean from you?
Who else would it be?
Bye.
What took so long?
What about your English lessons?
Hello, anybody home?
Yes, who is it?
I spoke with Mrs Tomizawa.
I told her I handed over our dues more than a week ago.
All this fuss makes me feel that I'm somehow responsible.
I'm really sorry.
Don't worry about it, Mrs Hayashi.
We know it's not your fault.
You didn't have to come just for that.
But I...
It's only because Mrs Tomizawa mentioned a washing machine that I began to wonder what happened.
That isn't what concerns me, though.
Well, of course it shouldn't.
But why hasn't the chairwoman received the dues yet?
This is all just so unpleasant for you, isn't it?
I'll ask Mrs Haraguchi.
I feel it's my responsibility.
Oh, I wouldn't bother with that.
It would only trouble her.
But I...
You don't have to worry. We all trust you.
Time will tell who's to blame.
Don't you worry.
It's a whodunit, just like in that movie, remember?
- But I...
- Don't worry about it.
What are you guys up to?
- Have you finished that translation yet?
- I'm working on it.
Are you two done?
Go ahead. Read it to me.
Do you understand? Translate it.
"My sister is three years old, and is younger than I am."
No, that's a bit different.
Translate it, Kouzou.
No, I said to translate it.
What does it mean?
Now, translate it.
Go ahead.
- Sorry, it's second nature now.
- What is?
We all do it now. Push me here again.
Silly.
- Are you all right?
- Of course I am.
What is it?
I've been eating pumice powder every day.
Who told you to do that, silly?
Zen's father.
It doesn't help, you know.
He was only teasing you.
But it is true. Isn't it? He's really good at it.
You called me?
- No.
- All right.
- I'm back.
- I'm back.
- I'm back.
- I'm back.
Why don't you ever listen to me?
You were next door again.
So what? We went over to watch TV.
But I told you no.
- Then buy us a TV.
- Absolutely not.
Buy us a TV.
No. Now eat your supper.
Here.
Go ahead.
Dried fish and miso soup again?
Don't complain.
Are you going to complain, too, Isamu?
I won't.
Back already?
We're home.
- You came together?
- Yes, from the station.
- You're back.
- We're having dried fish again.
You said you wouldn't complain.
How are you?
- The pork soup's good.
- Is it? Good.
- But I don't want to eat it every night.
- Here you are.
Auntie.
What is it?
My teacher said that the translation will be ready tomorrow.
All right.
How was the sumo wrestling today?
I wouldn't know.
We don't have a television set.
Mum, buy us a TV.
No.
What about the radio?
- It has to be a TV.
- You can't see anything on the radio.
- Buy us a TV set.
- Buy us a TV set.
I already told you no.
Would you like a bath?
You filled the tub already?
Who spilled toothpaste in the bathroom?
- Not me.
- Me neither.
Who then?
I don't know.
Neither do I.
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, sir.
Good morning. Good morning.
Don't dawdle on the way.
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.
Hey, are you ready?
No good.
Good. Now push me.
Let me try.
Let's go.
You've gotten really good.
Do you eat sweet potatoes?
No.
Did you call me?
No.
What is it?
I'm going to Kameido.
Do you want some sweets?
Yes, buy some.
It's a lovely day.
Yes?
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
You're early.
- Are you done with the translations?
- I've had to look up every technical term.
I'm about 70% done.
My office needs it by today.
- How's the rest going?
- Let me see.
Will you take this, then?
- I'll finish the rest today.
- That would be great.
Yeah.
Sis, Setsuko is here.
Welcome. I thought it was you.
- Good morning.
- Good morning. Off to work already?
Yes. I'm sorry to have to bother your brother.
No, it's good extra work.
My company folded, so I'll do just about anything.
I'll take this. Goodbye.
Setsuko.
There's talk about having the class reunion at Chinzanso.
- Tell your sister.
- Yes, I will. Bye.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Bye.
Setsuko's nice.
Wouldn't it be nice if she married you?
Are you joking? I'm out of a job now.
That's no problem. You'll find another one.
What about you? How's your job?
I may sell another Austin today.
Really? That's great.
Hello, is anyone here?
- Hello?
- Yes?
Oh, Mrs Haraguchi.
You should have come through the front.
Never mind that. Can I have a word?
Please come in. What is it?
It's a mess, but please come in.
All right.
Please.
We bought a washing machine, you know.
Yes, I heard.
I want one, too, but I can't afford it yet.
You can buy one if you want to.
It's your money, so why worry about it?
We're not rich like you.
But we bought one without making a big fuss about it.
Mother's making money, too, you know.
We don't need to steal the dues.
The very idea of it. How insulting.
Who said such a thing?
Don't pretend you don't know. Ask yourself.
- What?
- I'm fastidious by nature.
I'd never steal anything.
Such hateful gossip.
I'm going to quit.
I've simply been made a fool of.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
The dues. You're the treasurer.
What about it?
You said you gave me the dues, so now I look like a thief.
I haven't received the dues.
I took them over. I'm sure of it.
- When?
- The 28th of last month.
- I don't think so.
- But I did.
No, you didn't.
But I gave it to your mother.
Then she would have given it to me.
I wouldn't know. Ask her.
- Hello?
- Hi.
Please excuse me.
How do you do?
Do you want some rubber strings, toothbrushes, pencils or brushes?
We have everything we need.
Really? Everything?
That's what everybody says.
How about a pencil?
Quiet here, isn't it?
We don't need anything.
No? Don't say that. Come on. Buy a pencil.
It sharpens well.
How about you? Want a pencil?
Pencils, rubber strings, toothbrushes, brushes?
Hey, missus. Missus.
Whatever.
- Mother.
- What's the fuss?
- Has a salesman come by?
- I haven't seen one.
Will you talk to him when he comes?
He's awful.
Why? What happened?
- Anybody here?
- See? He's here.
Yes, who is it?
How do you do?
Rubber strings, toothbrushes, pencils.
Scrubbing brushes.
No, thanks.
Do you want a pencil? It sharpens well.
No.
Don't say that. Buy a pencil.
Can I sharpen it first?
Sure, sharpen it. Go ahead. Here.
Never mind.
I'll sharpen it with my own knife.
I've got cotton, too. Want some?
No.
Give me the pencil.
That's sharp.
How much for them?
50 yen.
That's expensive. Too expensive.
What's the matter? Leaving?
Come again.
Shut the door.
- Is he gone?
- Yes, he even left a pencil. See?
- No one can contend with you.
- Can't be a coward and be a midwife.
Listen, you didn't by any chance receive the dues?
I would have given it to you.
- You would?
- Yes.
Mrs Hayashi swears she paid you.
She didn't.
What is it?
Wait a minute.
This?
Yes, this.
Why didn't you give it to me?
Well, I...
Well, what?
Thanks to you, I can't go anywhere without feeling ashamed.
I'm the chairwoman.
I get blamed for everything.
You're so forgetful.
Why don't you go to Mt. Narayama with all the other dying, old folk?
I just feel so sick.
Humiliated when I didn't need to be.
Senile old woman.
It's more than I can take.
Always fussing.
Thinks she grew up all by herself.
After driving me crazy.
Marrying a no-good husband.
Thinks she's hot stuff.
And bearing a son like that...
She's got some nerve.
It's me again.
Sorry about earlier.
My mother is terrible.
She just told me she received the dues.
I don't think I can apologise enough.
I'm very sorry.
Well, now that you know, it's all right.
I'm really sorry.
I feel like crawling into a hole.
Please forget what I said earlier.
Sure. It's all right.
- Really?
- It's over.
I'm so glad. Thanks.
Don't tell anybody, will you? People gossip.
No, I won't.
Thanks again. Bye.
Mrs Haraguchi.
- Come look at this.
- What is it?
It's an alarm. The patent's pending.
Just push this in case of a burglary or fire, and it can be heard for 200 metres.
A burglar alarm?
It deters pushy salesmen, too.
You should've come sooner.
Did he come here?
I had to buy pencils. Rubber bands, too.
That's why the police recommend this.
Would you like one?
Well, shall I buy one?
- How about your place?
- I have a better alarm.
- You do?
- My mother.
She can handle anything.
What a nice day.
Yes, it is.
UKIYO RESTAURANT
I'm done.
All right. One more.
All right.
It's so cold.
You're late.
I bought this when I went out.
Tomorrow's races? Are you really into that?
How about the third race?
No good. Not a chance.
It's not worth it.
- No?
- No.
How about the other way round?
No good.
Here you are.
You think so?
Another one, please.
- Hey, get one more.
- All right.
- Welcome.
- Hello.
Did I leave my gloves here?
No. Have you seen them?
No, I haven't.
Okay.
- Mr Hayashi.
- Oh, hello.
Come. Have a seat.
- Sure.
- Sit for a while.
- Give me some stew, please.
- Sure.
- Here.
- Thanks.
Here you are.
Where were you today?
I have no prospects, but I have to eat.
Here, take this.
When is it for you?
What?
Here you are.
Retirement. Retirement.
It's terrible. It's like slowly being killed.
The companies think we don't eat after we retire.
But I eat and drink.
My wife worries, but I can't find a job.
I'm bogged down.
There's no place under the sky to hide.
It's so sad.
What about your pension?
No, no, the company is smart.
They won't pay much.
For 30 years, rain or shine... riding in a crowded train.
It's all for nothing. Futile.
Mr Tomizawa.
Mr Tomizawa?
Leave me alone.
- Some cake, please.
- Sure.
What are you doing? You're not eating?
No.
No? Fine.
It's no fun!
Behave, or I'll make you behave.
You're so stingy.
Go hungry, for all I care.
What about you, Isamu?
I won't eat.
Do as you wish.
Fools. How long are you going to keep this up?
Come here, Isamu.
Isamu.
Hey.
I won't go.
Why are you so unreasonable?
I'll tell your father.
I don't care. I'm not afraid.
That's your father now.
It's Father.
- You're home.
- Yes.
- It's cold, isn't it?
- Yeah.
I ran into Mr Tomizawa at the pub.
- He was pretty drunk.
- Really?
- What's going on here?
- They're impossible.
- What's wrong?
- They won't listen to me at all.
What?
Even though I've told them not to, they still go next door to watch TV.
So, buy us one.
They went next door instead of English class again today.
They're such a nuisance.
Then buy us a TV set.
Buy one.
- No.
- Then I'll go next door to watch TV.
Me, too.
Such stubborn children.
I don't care.
You're the stubborn one.
We only go there because we don't have a TV at home.
We wouldn't go if we had one.
- Quiet!
- Stop it, or your father will scold you.
I'm not afraid.
- I said quiet.
- I won't. I don't have to.
Look here.
What did you say?
No, let me go! Let go!
You talk too much.
When I tell you to stop, you stop.
I didn't say anything.
Fussing over such a small thing, like a woman.
Children shouldn't talk so much, so be quiet.
See? You were scolded.
I don't care. I want a TV.
You're talking too much.
So do grown-ups.
"Hello. Good morning. Good evening.
Have a good day."
Fool!
"How far is it? Just a little way. Is that so?"
Just a lot of talk. "I see, I see." Forget that.
Silence! Be quiet.
Boys shouldn't prattle on.
Be quiet.
Fine. I'll be silent for days.
I'd certainly appreciate that.
- 100 days.
- No, don't you start.
No more talking.
Come on, Isamu.
All right, then.
Such a nuisance.
Don't ever speak, Isamu... no matter what they say.
You understand? I mean it.
Don't talk. You got that?
Outside, too?
Yes. It's like a test.
- Good.
- Let me.
- Okay?
- Okay.
- This means I can talk, okay?
- Okay.
Farting's allowed.
- I'm home.
- Finally.
You're late.
Miss Fukui said your class reunion may be at Chinzanso.
- That's nice. Were you over there?
- Yes.
Where are the boys?
- In their room.
- Okay.
Good, good. Studying?
Do you want some cake?
It's really good.
See? You want some?
What's wrong? Don't you want any?
All right, then. We'll eat it.
It's awfully good, though.
I'm hungry. Aren't you?
For good health and good business.
Mother! Time to eat! Mother!
Buy some pants for him on your way home.
Again?
Yes. Cheap ones will do.
More?
You shouldn't.
Otherwise, your stomach won't get better.
Here.
More?
This is so nice. It's so quiet.
Don't talk.
Do you think it will last?
Say goodbye.
Good morning.
You're early today.
Kouzou's still getting ready.
Kouzou. Kouzou.
Good morning. That's a lovely scarf.
Did you have a fight with Minoru?
No, I didn't.
See you later.
I wonder what happened. It's so strange.
Such odd children.
What's wrong?
What's going on?
The children from across the way didn't even say "hello".
So?
They both just looked at me and didn't say a word.
Do you think Mrs Hayashi is still mad at me about yesterday?
Yesterday?
About the dues.
I don't think so.
Things like that happen all the time.
It all mother's fault, you know.
She didn't say anything to me.
If I hadn't asked her, she might have spent it.
I wouldn't have.
Everyone forgets.
I don't. Not important things.
Of course you forget.
I should know.
What's that? What have I ever forgotten?
The gas bill I paid for you.
You do it, too, you know.
Yet you ignore your own faults.
Enough of that, already.
I'm going out.
All right, then.
Saying that she never forgets.
And she doesn't even remember to pay me back.
She's always yakking away.
How on earth did I get a daughter like her?
Good morning.
Good morning.
Your husband's gone for the day?
He is.
I need to speak with you.
What's up?
She's an odd one.
Who? The cabaret woman?
Well, she's impossible, too.
But I mean Mrs Hayashi.
What about her?
Just because I was late with the dues, she's been telling everyone
I used the money to buy a washing machine.
Has she? Why, that's awful.
I know. So I went over to complain.
She apologised, and I thought we put the matter to rest.
But she's obviously still mad.
She's even told her children.
When I spoke to them this morning, they completely ignored me.
I can't stand it.
Is she really like that?
She is. I was surprised, too.
- I never thought she was like that.
- I know.
She obviously holds grudges, so you better watch out.
You're right. I better be on my guard.
Do you think I should return the beer
I borrowed?
Did you really borrow some?
Yeah, we were out.
Was that the other night?
Then you better hurry and return it.
You're right. I'm glad you told me.
Good morning.
- Hello?
- Oh, hello.
I forgot all about the beer.
I borrowed it the other day.
That's all right. There's no rush.
And here's the bus ticket you bought for me.
No, really, it's all right.
No, I should return it.
Goodbye.
Mrs Tomizawa?
Are you here?
Hey, Mrs Okubo's here.
Hi, please come in.
What's going on?
If you've ever borrowed something from Mrs Hayashi, you'd better return it.
- Why?
- Apparently, she likes to hold a grudge.
No. I've borrowed from her lots of times.
But she does. I was told so.
It came as a shock to me, too.
She seems educated, but one never knows.
That's too true.
Our cat stole some of her dried fish.
Do you think I should return it?
Definitely.
I will, then.
I already have.
It's such a weight off my chest.
Do you all understand the game?
Start with the last letter of the last word.
Crow, worm, moon.
Okay. What's next?
Yes, Akita.
Man, mask, moonlight.
No, the word has to start with an N.
Shimizu.
It is Suzunosuke Akado.
No, no. Start with the letter N.
Yes, Hayashi.
What starts with the letter N?
There are lots of words that do, aren't there?
What's wrong?
Is something the matter?
The toilet?
What does that mean?
What's wrong?
I don't understand.
All right, read it. Read it for me.
Speak up. I want you to read it out loud.
You know what it says.
All right, stay there.
That's all for now.
Remember to bring your lunch money tomorrow.
- Yes, sir.
- Good.
And please remember to bring your lunch money tomorrow.
- Yes.
- Yes.
Do you understand?
Please raise your hand if you do.
- Yes.
- Yes.
What about our lunch money?
Should I tell Mum?
No way. And no more talking.
What are we gonna do?
How long do you think they'll last?
It's best to just ignore them.
They're at that rebellious stage.
They're so much like their father.
What?
They're so stubborn.
They take after you.
That's not true.
It makes you wonder.
What's the matter?
- What's wrong?
- What is it?
What do you think?
I don't know. Do you have any ideas?
None.
What is it?
A building? A large house?
The government building? A temple?
A hospital?
No?
A school?
School? What about school?
Is it on fire?
Not a fire? It's not a fire?
Drinking tea? Then what?
Drinking tea, eating?
Money? Is it money?
So, the firemen put out the fire, and you paid them and gave them tea?
- What?
- Is that it?
Do you know?
I haven't got a clue. What's this about?
What did he mean?
I have no idea.
One, two, three, four, five, six.
One, two, three, four, five, six.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, four, five, six.
He's good.
Of course he is.
He works for the gas company.
Minoru's good, too, but now he won't talk.
Not even at school.
Five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
Hey.
Why won't you talk?
Don't you find it inconvenient?
What's wrong?
Did you take a vow?
What is it?
Hey.
Fools.
Still eating pumice powder?
If you keep that up, you'll die with a stomach full of stones.
- Really?
- Yes.
You know that seal that died at the zoo?
It's stomach was full of stones.
It thought the stones the visitors threw were food.
- Hello.
- Oh, it's you. What is it?
What are you doing here, boys?
Why don't you come and watch TV?
Are there any vacant rooms here?
I don't think so. You should ask downstairs.
Do you know of anywhere else?
I don't know. Who's looking?
I am. I want to move.
The neighbours are so tiresome.
Don't you know of anywhere at all?
N o really
You're not exactly friendly, are you?
Goodbye.
Yes?
Oh, it's you.
Hello.
So you're here.
I have more translation work for you.
Was the other translation okay?
It was.
I'll be back in four or five days for these.
Great. And thanks for the work.
Thank you.
What happened to these two?
They won't talk.
They were scolded for talking too much, so now they won't talk at all.
Is that so?
What did you say?
Say something, Isamu.
Come on.
What's the matter?
They said grown-ups talk too much, too.
"Good morning. Good evening. Good day.
Have a good day."
Yes, that's true.
We do say those things.
Yeah, we certainly do.
But maybe it's necessary.
It'd be a dull world without it.
Yes, but the children don't understand that yet.
No, they wouldn't know that yet.
But it does make the world go round.
Don't you agree?
Hey, Isamu. What are you mad about?
Is that so? I see.
Is that so?
Here, have a drink.
- Is that too much?
- No, no. Not at all.
Never mind.
Drinking and smoking are a waste of time, too.
But why worry?
That's right.
I know how the kids feel when they ask you to buy it.
I'd like one, too, but I can't afford it.
That's not the problem.
I'm against buying one.
I remember hearing someone say that TV just produces a society of idiots.
Is that so? What do they mean?
It means the Japanese will be reduced to idiots.
Now, that would be a travesty.
But what does it really mean?
What do you think?
What?
About television?
Television?
You mean the idiot box?
You've heard of that?
Oh, yeah. TV is a total waste of time.
You think so?
Who knew?
I guess it's a bad idea to have too many conveniences.
That's right.
If you say so.
I'm back.
Have you come to visit us?
I'm glad you came. You're a good boy.
You're back already?
I'm sorry, Mrs Hayashi.
Is my wife out?
Thanks for house-sitting.
Your home's next door.
Is it?
Oh, my gosh. Sorry about that.
Do you need a hand?
No, I'm all right.
I'm home.
Were you drinking again?
Bingo! I found the right place this time.
I don't believe it.
I feel good, so leave me alone.
I feel so good.
Listen, are you done?
Not yet.
What time is the truck coming?
It'll come around 3:00, so hurry up.
What are you doing? What's the rush?
The next door neighbours are moving.
Yes, I saw. Neighbours are a pain, though.
I feel like moving, too.
But neighbours are everywhere.
Unless you live in the mountains.
True.
Do mice gnaw on pumice stone?
I don't think so.
That's odd, then. It's going fast.
Should I put some rat poison on it?
I'm hungry. We haven't had any snacks.
I know.
I don't think we should eat pumice stone anymore. Won't we die?
Maybe.
We're not full of stones yet, are we?
Hello?
Hello?
- It's our teacher.
- What'll we do?
Come on.
Is that so?
I scolded them for talking too much.
I see. At least now I understand what was going on.
Isamu won't talk, either.
I'm sorry they gave you so much trouble.
Raising children is a difficult task.
You should be more strict with them.
- We wouldn't mind at all.
- No, I'm afraid not.
Hi. Oh, you have a guest.
Please, come in. I was just leaving.
Thank you and goodbye.
Thank you.
They'll bring their lunch money tomorrow.
Great. Thank you.
- Come in, Mr Tomizawa.
- Thanks. Excuse me.
Lovely weather, isn't it?
Yes. A spell of lovely weather.
- Welcome.
- I'm sorry about last night.
I was scolded by my wife this morning.
You seem in good spirits today.
Rejoice in my good fortune. I found a job.
That's great.
It's not a big company.
Kowa Electric Company. Do you know it?
Across from a restaurant. I'm in sales.
That's good.
Hard work, though.
I have to do door-to-door.
I see. Toasters, mixers.
And washing machines, too.
How about buying one?
We can't.
How about buying something?
Well.
We have instalments, too.
We must buy something to celebrate your new job.
Please do that. I have other catalogues.
I'll get them. Just a sec.
It's time for us to think about it, too.
What?
Retirement.
Want some tea?
Yes, please.
Messy, isn't it?
Yes. Fun, isn't it?
I want rice.
It tastes good.
I'd like some side dish, too.
- Shall I get it?
- Yes, get some.
Okay.
Hurry up, Minoru!
- Hello.
- Good evening.
Our boys aren't here?
No. Anything wrong?
Did they come at all?
No, not today.
- What is it?
- They went out in the afternoon.
You must be worried.
Yes. But they may be home now.
Good night.
Take care.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
I wonder what's going on.
Strange kids. Still not talking?
It's rather interesting.
For children, our greetings may seem like a waste of time.
I do it all the time to sell cars. I have to.
Yes, it acts as a social lubricant in our world.
But important things are difficult to say.
Whereas, meaningless things are easy to say.
You, too.
What do you mean?
- Can't admit you're in love.
- What?
About Setsuko.
You only talk of the weather and work, but you never say how you feel.
You're wrong.
I'm not wrong. I know.
Get around to important things.
Go out and look?
- What?
- The kids.
They're out since this afternoon?
It's too long.
Yes. Shall I look for them?
- Yes, you do that.
- Okay.
It's cold. Wear something warm.
I will.
Check in front of the cinema.
I'm back. Are they home?
- Not yet.
- I see.
I went to his apartment.
What's that?
I got it at the police station.
They left them and ran away.
Where did they go? Do you have any idea?
I'll go and look.
No, I'll go.
- Where'd they go?
- The nuisances.
It's cold. Wear something warm.
- Good evening.
- Yes?
- Hi.
- Good evening.
Come in.
Where were you?
They're back.
Please don't scold them.
They were watching TV in front of the station.
Really?
Thank you very much.
Idiots. You made us worry.
Well, I must be going now.
- Thank you very much.
- Thanks a lot.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Goodbye, boys.
Come in.
Don't worry. Come in.
Come on up.
Come on.
Great.
- It's awesome.
- Yeah.
- You bought it?
- You really bought it?
Yes, Father did.
It's brilliant!
Mr Tomizawa brought it over.
- How much?
- It's expensive!
How much?
Never mind.
You two study hard now.
- Yes, I will!
- Yes, I will.
Thanks!
Are we lucky! Nice?
We can watch baseball too. Are we lucky!
Hey.
Aren't you hungry?
No. Teacher treated us to noodles.
Dumplings, too.
I see. Not hungry, then?
I'm so happy!
Look here!
If you're noisy, I'll return it!
He's lying. His face says so.
He's smiling.
Watch it!
- I'm going!
- I'm going!
Take care.
Have the TV ready when we come home!
We're off!
Good morning! Did Kouzou go?
Kouzou. Kouzou.
Good morning! Did Zen go?
- Yes, he just left.
- Thanks.
Hurry up, Kouzou!
- I'm going!
- Yeah, I'm going, too.
What's going on?
They talked, didn't they?
What happened?
Listen, Mrs Tomizawa!
What is it?
Hello.
What is it?
The Hayashi boys were very cheerful this morning.
Yes. They said, "Good morning".
You've got them all wrong.
That family is nice, and Mrs Hayashi's very understanding.
Think so?
Yes, you're wrong.
I'm going shopping. Need anything?
No? Okay, then.
What's with her?
I guess the Hayashis bought a hot plate or something.
You're probably right.
She's a calculating woman.
You still eat pumice stone?
It's bad for you. You'll die.
I've quit. I've switched to burdock.
Push me.
Now me.
Your turn.
No good. You're still no good.
What's the matter?
I'm going home.
I'll come later.
Good morning.
- Good morning. Thanks for last night.
- No problem.
Where to?
- To West Ginza.
- Then we can go together.
Okay.
A lovely day, isn't it?
Yes, it really is a lovely day.
Do you think we'll have nice weather for a while?
Let's see.
It does look like we'll have nice weather for a while.
That cloud's an interesting shape.
Yes, it is an interesting shape.
It kind of looks like something.
Yes, like something.
What a lovely day.
Yes, a really fine day.
You're a fool.
And such a big boy, too.
What a nuisance.
I won't die, will I?
I swallowed pumice stone by mistake.
You'd be better off dead, being absent from school like this.
I won't feed you till you're well.
You hear me?
Can I have clean underwear, please, Mum?
You won't wear any until you're better.
(man) This is the story of a boy and his dream...
but more than that...
it is the story of an American boy...
and a dream that is truly American.
The year... 1928.
The time... spring.
If you were a young man,
your thoughts were undoubtedly turning to those of love.
But if you were a young boy,
your thoughts were of one thing...
baseball.
Give me some high ones!
Come on!
Here... right over here!
Give me a fast one!
Crack!
Give me one... come on!
Come on... I'll show you how!
Crack!
Give me a good high one!
Great bunch of infielders we got.
Yeah, big leaguers.
Phump.
Hit me one, mister?
What do you want?
Grounders, flies, anything.
Watch this.
Crack!
Right here... come on!
How's that for a ballplayer?
Yeah, we ought to give him another chance.
Hey, kid, you want another?
(kid) Yes, sir.
Here it comes!
Crack!
Hey, kid, come here a minute.
Now, don't tell me that one didn't sting.
Just a little bit.
Haven't you got a glove?
No, sir.
Come here a minute.
You mean I can borrow this?
No... you can have it.
For keeps?
For keeps!
Yea!!!
(kid) Mom! Mom!
Yes, Jackie?
Look, Mom!
Where'd you get it?
A man gave it to me.
Torn!
You can sew it up.
Oh, Jackie!
Heh-heh-heh
Jackie!
Yes, Mom?
Sew 'em on like that?
No, Mom.
The way you have them now reads.
"Junior Pasadena College."
That way, Mom.
Pasadena Junior College.
Of course.
How'd I get it mixed up like that?
My, my...
They wouldn't know who I'd be jumping for at the track meet.
That what your brother
Mack won a medal for?
That what you're talkin' about?
Won a medal?
When Mack jumped for Pasadena Junior College he broke the National
Junior College record and nobody has jumped that far since.
That's nice!
Heh-heh
This kid jumped
25 feet, 6 1/2 inches, Bill.
Broke his brother's record.
Do you think maybe he could, ah, jump over that
Southern Cal line?
He led the conference in TDs.
Only, there's one problem, Bill.
You mean the Trojans have already got him?
Heh... no, no.
He's a colored boy.
I heard somebody squawking about giving colored boys too many athletic scholarships.
Colored boys are all right with me, if they're the right color.
The right color?
I like a good, clean,
American boy with a B average.
If that's the kind of a boy you're talking about-
his colors are blue and gold.
UCLA colors, huh?
That's right, and you can tell it to Robinson for me.
Fvee-fvee-fvwheet!
Come on, Jackie, come on.
Come on, boy.
Come on, Jackie.
Come on!
You're his brother, aren't you?
That's right.
You're Mack Robinson.
I ran against you when you were at Oregon.
Oh, sure, you ran for Southern Cal.
Pete Schubeck... this is my wife.
Hello, Mack.
How do you do?
This is Rae Isum, Jackie's girl.
- Hello.
- Glad to know you.
What are you doing these days?
Oh, I got a good, steady job.
Glad to hear it.
Come on, Jackie.
Tweet-tweet.
Easing up?
Yeah, a lot.
What's the matter with those guys, giving it to Jack like that just because he's...
Because he's the best halfback on the field.
Oh, yeah... yeah, sure.
And Jackie,
I wasn't kidding about that either.
They have a lot of respect for you out there.
I have a lot of respect for them too.
Believe me.
How's Mack been doing lately?
I always liked Mack.
Mack?
Oh, Mack's doin' fine.
Been waitin' long?
No, just got here.
Somebody told me you got an honorable mention on the All-American.
Did I?
Somebody else told me you cut class this morning.
Could be.
Was it because you worked late last night?
And I went to see about a better job...
A full-time job.
Why now?
You've still got some time before you graduate.
If I graduate.
Oh.
Suppose I finish out the year.
I'm no further along than when I started...
No closer to getting a half-decent job so I can afford to get married.
Who are you thinking of marrying, Mr. Robinson?
Oh, you know who.
Your mother'll take it hard if you quit school now.
Yes, I know.
You ought to talk to her before you do anything...
And to Mack.
Yeah... it was Mack I was thinking of.
Well, if you'd just wait till June and get your diploma...
A lot of good a college education did Mack.
Well, Mack's all right.
He's got a job.
Yeah... a good, steady job.
Hey, Mack!
What are you doing here this time of night?
I fixed you some lunch.
Here, catch!
Man, that's really smart signal callin'.
I thought you'd be hungry.
I'm always hungry.
Sit awhile?
Sure.
Anything botherin' you?
I wanna quit college.
Right after the basketball season.
What for?
I gotta get a job.
I wanna marry Rae.
School's one thing, but...
You and Mom can't support Rae too.
Can't it wait till you graduate?
What good will a degree do me?
They're not hiring colored football coaches.
Not our color anyway.
Don't you want to play baseball this season?
What good will that do me?
Baseball's one sport they'll never let me in.
Yeah, it's your best sport too.
I wonder if there's any place where they will let you in.
Here's one place nobody draws the color line.
Yeah... great job for a college man.
May not be a great job, but it's steady.
Nice going that half, Jackie.
Thanks a lot.
What's this I hear about you quitting?
Yeah, right after the basketball season.
We'll miss you, fella.
You got a job lined up?
No, not yet.
What about those letters to high schools?
Any answers?
Three.
What'd they say?
The first school didn't want me for a coach.
The second school didn't want me for a coach.
And, heh, the third school...
They just didn't want me.
Any mail for me?
Five more letters.
Business must be good.
Let's open 'em.
Pickwick College doesn't want any coaches.
Bainbridge either.
See what's in this one.
Horton U. Says sorry.
Western State... no soap.
Uh-oh... you've got a job, brother.
I have?
What does it say?
Listen to this...
"From the President of the United States.
Greetings!"
(woman) He sure writes interesting letters.
(Rae) Oh, yes!
Listen to this, Mildred.
"The other day my commanding officer
"called me in and told me the good news.
"So I'm some kind of athletic director at last, even if it's for the army."
Sounds like he's happy.
And he looks good too.
In his new picture.
And a lieutenant now.
That's a mighty fine job.
Why can't this wait till later on?
Dinner's almost ready.
It'll only take a minute, Mom.
That's just like you.
First thing on top is your glove.
What're you going to do with it?
Don't know if I'll ever do anything with it again.
Ah, more mail again.
I bet you spent
50 bucks on stamps.
If it gets me a job, it'll be worth it.
Idaho Poly doesn't want any coaches.
I could have guessed that.
Hey, wait a minute.
What is it?
A job!
Not the President greeting me again?
No, but you read it.
Robinson, you're up next.
Pick out the one you like and give it a ride.
Yes, sir!
Now batting for the Black Panthers,
Jackie Robinson, shortstop.
All right, just a minute, boy.
This is a new boy, Sampson.
Take it real easy with him.
Nice and easy.
Let him hit it.
Yeah, I'll do that little thing.
Okay, boy...
I fixed it right up for you.
Easy, man... throw it easy.
(umpire) Strike!
What?
Let me help you up,
Mr. Robinson.
My goodness,
I don't know what's wrong with that pitcher today.
You hadn't ought to do that, Sampson.
You'll make this boy mad.
Nice and easy, I said!
Ball one!
What's wrong with that boy?
He's incorrigible, that's what he is...
Incorrigible!
Right here now, man!
Strike two!
Man alive, you sure swing pretty!
- Hold it!
- Whack!
(umpire) Safe!
You shouldn't a done that, new boy.
I thought we gonna be friends.
(catcher) Oh, why didn't you throw the ball right?
Safe!
Hey, that's enough of that.
How about "Shortnin' Bread"?
Never mind about
"Shortnin' Bread."
How about some ham and eggs?
That's a pretty good idea.
How about something to eat?
Okay, okay, we'll stop at the next drive-in.
Is it always like this?
Sleeping on the bus?
Most of the time.
We sleep and we eat and we play ball.
Then we get on a bus
and do it all over again.
You got a cigarette?
I don't smoke.
That Ernie...
Always beggin' cigarettes.
I can't afford to buy 'em!
Why not?
Don't you get paid like the rest of us?
Yeah, I get paid a little.
Got a wife in Birmingham.
I have to send her every buck.
Got a new baby comin' in a couple of weeks.
Sure wish I could be there.
Why don't you take a week off?
Can't... haven't got the money.
After what I send home,
I just make it to payday.
You're breakin' my heart.
Here.
Thanks, boy!
Get back! Get back!
Who's going in?
New boy's turn.
Rules and regulations.
New boy always goes first.
I guess that means you, Jackie.
What will I have to do?
Three things.
See if we can eat inside.
Two, see if we can wash up.
Three, if we can't eat inside, see if they'll fix up sandwiches.
Yeah, what is it?
Sixteen of us outside in a bus.
How's chances of getting something to eat?
Well, uh, I'm all alone here.
Afraid I couldn't help ya.
How about some sandwiches?
Could we have sandwiches?
Well, I, uh...
clang-clang.
How many of them did you say?
(Jackie) Sixteen.
Well, I could make you
16 beef sandwiches, and maybe the same in ham and egg.
That'd do you?
Swell.
How about some fried potatoes on the side, Chef?
Yep.
Take about 20 minutes.
Thanks.
Do you suppose we could wash up a bit?
Sorry, it's out of order.
Say, Ernie.
Yeah?
When are they gonna give me a contract?
Contract?
You want to know about contracts?
Yes!
Say, fellas!
This man wants to know about contracts.
Contracts?
Fix you right up with the information.
Yes, sir, contracts.
Tell him about that, boy.
You want a contract with the Panthers?
The first thing you've got to do... is borrow some money from the boss.
Then you got a job until he gets paid back.
If you can get him to lend the geetus.
Keep your eye on the grandstand.
Got a good day and a good crowd...
That's the time to hit 'im up.
Owe him a week's salary...
You got a one-week contract.
Owe him for two...
You got a two-week contract.
The oss-bay.
Get out of here and get a little work.
Come on!
Fwhee-ooohh.
Strike two!
(umpire) You're out!
Well, that's the ball game.
That Robinson sure had a good day, didn't he?
Sure did!
(man) Robinson!
Robinson, can I see you?
I'm Clyde Sukeforth... of the Brooklyn Dodgers.
I'd like to talk for a minute.
What about?
About you.
Branch Rickey would like to see you.
He would?
Do you think you could get away for a day?
I guess so.
Good... I'll take care of the tickets.
Now you meet me at the Union Station at 7 o'clock.
The New York gate.
Is that okay?
Sure... that's great.
(Ernie) Hey, who's your friend?
Scout for the Brooklyn Dodgers.
Signed me for the
New York Yankees.
Were gonna give me a bonus to pitch for the Red Sox.
And then his keeper came.
Some guys think they're funny.
Yeah, you can say that again.
Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-tap
ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-tap.
Yes?
(Clyde) Robinson!
Clyde Sukeforth.
Sukeforth?
Ta-ta-ta-ta-tap.
Robinson, is that you in there?
Coming!
I don't understand this, Robinson!
Don't you have a good mind?
Or are you playing coy?
I waited for you till
I missed the train.
What's the idea?
You don't mean you're really with the Dodgers?
Whaoooooo...
You got a girl, Jackie?
Well, uh, I don't know.
What do you mean, you don't know?
Traveling around all the time, and not writing as often as I should...
I think I still have a girl.
Good, you'll need one.
Do you know why we brought you here?
No, sir... not exactly.
I heard you were starting a colored ball team.
Is that it?
No, you were brought here to play with the Brooklyn organization.
Montreal, to start with.
Me?
Play for Montreal?
I want to win pennants and we need ballplayers.
The war set us back a little.
So, three years ago, the Brooklyn Dodger management
decided to scout untapped sources of supply...
Mexico, Cuba, all the
Latin American countries, and our own country too.
That right, Clyde?
From coast to coast.
Yes... for players who can help us win.
Many of the men we saw were good.
Some had great promise...
Like you.
Do you think you can do it, Jackie?
Make good in organized baseball?
If I got the chance.
There's more here than just playing.
I wish it just meant runs and hits and errors...
The things you can see in a box score.
Heh... a box score.
You know, a box score is really democratic, Jackie.
It doesn't say how big you are or how your father voted in the last election, or what church you attend.
It just tells you what kind of a ballplayer
you were that day.
Well, isn't that what counts?
It's all that ought to count.
And maybe someday it's all that will count.
That's why we brought you here.
I want to see if we can make a start in that direction.
It'll take a lot of courage.
Yeah... it sure will.
It might take more courage for the organization than for you, Jackie.
Have you thought of that?
I haven't thought of anything.
It's all so sudden...
Kind of hits me straight between the eyes.
Just relax, boy.
There's plenty of time.
Pull up a chair...
Make yourself comfortable.
Thanks.
We're tackling something big here, Jackie.
If we fail, no one will try again for 20 years.
But if we succeed...
If we succeed, Brooklyn will win a pennant.
Yes, that too.
But we're dealing with rights here...
The right of any American to play baseball...
The American game.
Do you think he's our boy, Clyde?
Well, he can run, he can hit, and he can field.
But can he take it?
That, I don't know.
What do you think, Jackie?
Well, I can try.
Think you've got guts enough to play the game no matter what happens?
They'll shout insults at you.
They'll come into you spikes first.
They'll throw at your head.
They've been throwin' at my head for a long time, Mr. Rickey.
Suppose I'm a player in the heat of a game.
I collide with you at second base.
And when I get up, I say,
"You dirty black so-and-so!"
What do you do?
Mr. Rickey, do you want a ballplayer who's afraid to fight back?
I want a ballplayer with guts enough
not to fight back.
You've got to do this job with base hits, stolen bases, and fielding ground balls, Jackie.
Nothing else.
I'm playin' against you and I'm hotheaded.
I want to win this game.
I go into you spikes first.
You jab the ball in my ribs.
The umpire says, "Out."
All I see is your face...
That black face over me.
So I haul off and punch you right in the cheek.
What do you do?
Mr. Rickey, I've got two cheeks.
Good!
You under contract to the Black Panthers?
No, sir, we don't have contracts.
Do you have any agreement about how long you'll play?
No, sir, none at all.
All right.
Clyde will give you a contract before you leave.
Don't sign it right away.
This is a very important move.
Think it over carefully.
Is your, ah, mother living?
Yes, sir, she's in California.
Call her up... ask her advice.
We'll pay the phone bill.
Yes, sir.
And, Jackie... remember one thing.
No matter what happens on the ball field, you can't fight back.
That's going to be the hard part...
You can't fight back.
Helen, get
Jackie Robinson's home in Pasadena, California.
It's Sycamore 7-6-4-5-9.
Brrrrrrring
Hello?
Who?
From New York?
Yes, put him on, please.
It... it's Jackie, Mom.
Calling from New York.
Why is he calling?
Is somethin' wrong with him?
Just a minute, Mom.
Hello?
Yes!
Jackie?!
How are you, kid?
Are you okay?
He's okay, Mom.
You want to talk to Mom?
Sure, she's right here.
He wants to talk to you, Mom.
Hello, Jackie.
You all right?
You've got a chance for what?
I can be the first Negro to ever play in organized baseball, Mom.
If I'm good enough...
If I can make the grade.
Only, I'll be taking a big chance.
Mack, they want Jackie to play baseball for...
For Brooklyn.
They do?
Yeah.
Well, Jackie, I don't know what kind of advice to give you.
Only... only there must be churches in a big town like New York.
Why don't you go find yourself a church and talk to the minister and see what he has to say.
And Jackie, any time you have a real problem, listen to God about it.
Here, talk to your brother Mack.
He knows more about baseball than I do.
Tap-tap.
Come in.
Are you Reverend Carter?
That's right, son.
My name's Robinson...
Jackie Robinson.
Glad to know you, Mr. Robinson.
I need some advice...
Important advice.
Well, suppose we sit down and talk this thing over.
You're new to this part of the city, Mr. Robinson?
I'm from California.
I came to New York yesterday to see Branch Rickey.
Rickey?
Do you mean, uh...
Mr. Rickey, the baseball man?
Yes.
I'm a ballplayer, Reverend.
I've just learned that the Brooklyn Dodgers have been scouting Negro players for a couple of years, and Mr. Rickey thinks
I'm good enough to...
Reverend, it means that a colored man will be able to play on the same field with a white man for the first time.
Uh, who goes out to these ball parks, Jackie?
Just white men?
No, anybody can buy a ticket, Reverend.
Colored or white.
Ah, tell me, Jackie.
What do you think would actually happen if you were to get out on a white baseball field?
I don't know.
They might call me names.
They might even beat me up.
I don't mean what would happen to you, Jackie.
I mean, what would happen to the colored people?
Might start fights.
Might even start a riot.
That's true.
On the other hand, every step forward for our people has started a fight somewhere...
For the time being, anyhow.
This is a big thing you have to decide, Jackie,
and not just for you alone.
It's a big thing
for the whole colored people.
I know.
That's why I came to you for help.
A great deal depends upon you, Jackie.
What kind of a man you are.
I suppose upon...
what kind of a ballplayer you are too.
I don't know what kind of a man I am, Reverend, but, ah, I think I'm a pretty good ballplayer.
That might help... yes, it might help a great deal.
It's wonderful to see you, especially when I'd...
I'd almost given you up.
I should have written oftener but... you know how it is?
You keep waiting for good news...
Something worth writing about.
And then when this big chance came,
I didn't want to tell you.
I wanted to be sure
I had the contract signed.
You know, sometimes when you wait for real good news, you wait forever.
I guess so.
I don't want to wait forever.
Look, let's sit a minute.
Let's talk it over.
All right.
It's gonna be real tough.
A lot of people don't want a Negro in baseball.
I know.
As soon as I make it stick,
I'll come for you.
We'll get married.
No... not after you've made good, Jackie.
Now... before you start.
I can't let you do that.
I've got to go south for spring training.
I'll have to face that.
It might not be easy.
It'll be easier if we face it together.
It won't be any picnic.
You marry me now, and you're askin' for trouble.
All right, Jackie.
I'll ask for it.
(man) Daytona Beach, next stop.
Are you Jackie Robinson?
Yes, I am and this is my wife.
Glad to know you.
My name's Gaines.
I'm an attorney here.
Mr. Rickey asked me if I could help arrange accommodations for you.
He did?
Sent a man down to look up a place for you to stay.
I won.
That's very nice of you, Mr. Gaines.
We're proud to have you.
Your bags will be in the checkroom.
My car's right out front.
Crack!
Whack!
Whack!
Fvwhee-whooo.
Hey, Robinson.
Ask you a few questions?
You think there's goin' to be trouble?
He means trouble with the other players.
Trouble?
The only trouble
I'm worried about's ground balls to my right.
Think you're good enough to make the Dodgers?
Don't know if I can make Montreal.
Better concentrate on that first.
What are you gonna do if a pitcher throws at your head?
Same as you'd do... duck!
What're you sportswriters doin' up at this hour of the mornin'?
Walkin' in your sleep?
Thought we'd take a look at your new ballplayer, Clay.
Look at him playin' ball...
Not flappin' his mouth with you guys.
Get out there and throw a few, loosen up your arm.
Yes, Mr. Hopper.
Do you think baseball will accept a colored second baseman?
First, let's see if I will.
Whack whack whack whack whack whack thud, thud... thud.
Let's have one!
Want me to take the first one?
Or shall I hit away?
Use your own judgment, Shorty.
How's that high elbow comin'?
Keep you from hittin' under the ball?
Don't work out like it should, Mr.
Hopper.
Of course, I don't pop to the infield anymore.
I just fly into center field.
Shorty's got a problem.
He's built too close to the ground.
But I've got a new idea.
When I take the bat back,
I'm gonna hold it up.
I ought to come through higher.
(umpire) Batter up.
That's me.
I ought to hit right on the line.
You watch.
Whack!
(umpire) You're out of there!
(catcher)
All right, Tex, hurry it up!
All right, Eddie.
Get 'em out of there, Ed!
All right, gang!
(catcher) Attaboy, Ed, come on!
Whack!
(umpire) Out!
Fvwhee-whooo.
Let's get this guy out of here!
Come on!
(umpire ) Ball!
All right, Eddie!
Bring it on, Ed!
Come on now.
(catcher) All right, Eddie.
Plunk!
(umpire) He's out!
Now if he can hit like that too.
Fvwhee-whoo
(umpire) Ball!
Bring the ball in here.
That's the one... that's the one!
(umpire) Ball... two!
Whack!
Did you get that?
I got it.
All right, Hank!
This guy's got a hole in his bat.
Let's get him out of here.
Strike... one!
Whack!
(catcher) Come on, Jackie!
He's out!
No other human being could've made that play!
Mr. Rickey, do you really think he is a human bein'?
Think Jackie's gonna like these.
Knitting, knitting.
Seems like that's all you ever do, Mrs. Robinson.
Why don't you walk downtown once in a while?
Or maybe take a ride to the beach?
I'm afraid to.
Afraid?
No one's going to hurt you here.
I'm not so sure.
The last time I took a bus
I heard some white men talking... about Jackie.
About what they'd do if a colored man tried to play on this city's team.
Oh, you know... they talk big, but they don't usually mean it.
Maybe they don't usually... but sometimes they do.
Some of the things they said gave me cold chills.
Somebody get a key.
(player) Can't we get in?
Oh, Mr. Rickey, look at this.
Back in the bus, boys.
Back in the bus.
Come on, Jackie.
We don't want trouble.
I'm the cause of the trouble, Mr. Rickey.
Maybe you'd like to call it off.
Maybe you'd rather
I went back to the Panthers.
Not on your life!
We started this together, boy, and we'll finish it together.
We'll complete the training season and you'll complete it with us.
Come on.
And ladies and gentlemen, believe me, it should be the best welterweight battle in the past ten years.
And sports fans, all is not so quiet on the baseball front as officials would have us believe.
While there are no known organized movements against Montreal's
Jackie Robinson, it is a fact that some cities are expressing pretty strong sentiments.
So strong, in fact, that I hear the International League president, Shaughnessy, will make a significant visit to the Brooklyn Dodger office in the immediate future... perhaps... tomorrow.
And now, to answer some mail as time allows.
Clunk.
Branch, I've got to talk to you.
Well, go ahead and talk.
Branch... the season opens in
Jersey City tomorrow.
Oh, glad you told me.
And this is your last chance to avoid a big mistake.
Now suppose you let me decide that.
You'll break up the whole International League playing that colored boy.
I've had letters, phone calls...
I've even polled all the sportswriters.
What do the sportswriters have to say?
Jim Flanagan thinks you're even hurting the Negroes.
This'll stir up a lot of trouble.
There'll be black and white fights all over the country, and you'll be sorry you ever started it.
Frank, I've spent my whole life in baseball, and I've always been proud of that, because I've always thought baseball was a fine game, a clean game.
I've always thought it had a good influence on the American people, on the kids growing up.
I've always thought baseball taught fair play and sportsmanship.
But if what you say is true, then I've been all wrong.
My whole life's been wrong... wasted.
I'll tell you what
I'll do with you.
I'll go out to Jersey City with you tomorrow and we'll sit in a front box.
And if anybody's got any rocks to throw, they can throw 'em at me.
Phump, phump.
Are you nervous?
A little... maybe.
I won't be when we get on the field.
Another hour and it'll begin.
Would you rather I didn't go?
Nooo! You might as well come.
If I'm gonna fall on my face, might as well be in front of you.
You won't fall down.
I won't if trying will do it.
You think I can run?
Wait'll you see me this afternoon.
I can't break in with any scratch hit and fielder's choice.
I've got to set them on their ear.
I've got to be the best ballplayer they've ever seen anywhere.
That's the spirit.
(vendor) chewing gum, Cracker Jacks!
Anyone else? Five cents change.
And that's a fact, ladies and gentlemen...
25,000 people are here to see baseball history made today at Roosevelt Stadium in Jersey City for this...
The opening of the 1946
International League season.
Even though the ball game has started, excited fans are still crowding in to this huge concrete horseshoe.
It's a holiday throng...
Eager and expectant...
But with one thing in mind.
What will the highly publicized
Jackie Robinson do today?
Will organized baseball's first Negro player make good, or... will he fail?
You fans out there, what do you think?
(man) Programs!
Programs!
(catcher) Attaboy, Bill!
Come on, Bill!
Ball!
(catcher) Here you go!
Here, Bill! Here, baby!
Whack!
Well, I guess he's got the jitters.
Well, anybody can make an error.
That was an awful easy chance.
Well, as the poet said,
"To err is human," and Jackie Robinson proved himself indeed a mortal man in the first inning by booting that easy play, permitting
Jersey City's first run.
But the game is young, fans...
And so is Jackie.
Strike!
Jackie?
You're up next... get on deck.
Yes, sir.
Boooo! Boooo...
whack!
Play ball!
And now, here's the moment everyone's been waiting for.
This big crowd is silent and tense as Jackie stands there at the plate.
He's a right-handed batter.
Stands well back in the box, feet wide apart, very good form.
And every eye in this stadium is on that boy.
Anxious... as Jackie stands there, waiting for that first pitch.
Give it to me, come on!
Strike!
Thunk.
Safe!
Fvwhee-whoo
(umpire) Safe!
Fvwhee-whoo
fvwhee-whoo
(umpire) Safe!
(man) Hurry up, Jackie!
Right here!
(umpire) Strike one!
Balk! Balk!
He made a balk!
Balk! Balk! He made a balk!
Come on in!
Go in, Robinson.
(catcher) All right, here we go.
Come on.
(umpire) Strike!
Fvwhee-whoo.
Strike!
Attababy!
Whack!
Yes, sir, folks, it's a historic day.
But a sad one for Jersey.
There's two out in the ninth, and the score is 14 to 1 with a single Jersey
City put-out left.
There it goes!
It's a high grounder to Robinson's left!
It'll be close!
But he stabs it!
Jackie goes to first for the out, and the ball game is over!
What a memorable day!
Especially for Jackie Robinson, and for the president of the Brooklyn Dodgers,
Branch Rickey.
That's the greatest first day any ballplayer ever had!
Man, oh, man!
Four hits including a homer, two stolen bases, and scored twice on balks.
Yes, he played a great game, but...
Oh, that's the trouble with you, Frank.
There you go "but-ing" again.
No, but you know where Montreal is playing next week, Branch, and they don't like colored people there.
Here, look at this.
The sports editor sent it to me.
(vendor) Cold beer, 25.
Hey, punk, give me a beer.
Yeah, me too.
How many altogether?
Make it three.
You got a shine playin' here this afternoon.
Not me... I ain't got him.
You've got him.
I've got 'im?
I don't live here.
Where you from?
I'm from Brooklyn.
I drive a truck here once a week.
When you get back home, tell Rickey that you spoke with a couple of friends of his nigger ballplayer.
Yeah... keck... friends.
Don't tell me about it.
I just don't like shines.
Yeah?
That mean anything to ya?
No.
I thought you was one of the boys.
One of what boys?
Shut up, Spike!
Oh, what's the diff?
We got a little club, kinda.
Branches all over the country.
When they get uppity, we kinda put 'em in their place.
Pheet-phooo.
Look what's comin'.
Ah, this seat is taken.
Sorry.
Excuse me.
Maybe you'd like to come with us?
Shut up, Spike!
Where you goin' after the ball game?
The lodge has decided to send a delegation.
(Spike) That's us.
You hadn't ought to tell anybody.
Aww, this guy's all right.
We're gonna call on Robinson
soon as the game is over.
We don't like them boys playin' ball around here.
Not in this town.
Robinson!
Clak-clak-clak.
Get out there, Robbie.
BOOOOOO! BOOOOOO!
Let's go, darling... quick!
What's the matter?
Where you goin', black boy?
Don't run away, black boy!
We're the welcoming committee.
Better get out of here.
No, Jackie.
It makes it tougher havin' you here.
We want to have a talk with you.
We don't want you in this town, see?
No matter what happens on the ball field,
you can't fight back.
That's going to be the hard part...
You can't fight back.
You better not play tomorrow!
Get me?
Get me?
Having any trouble, Jackie?
No... no trouble.
We'll just walk to the bus with you.
Out of my way, you!
Nice game today, Jackie.
Thanks... thanks a lot.
Shorty.
Yes, Mr. Hopper?
A little present for you.
Present?
Just what you need.
Gee, Mr. Hopper, that's awful nice of you.
New pair of shoes!
Mmmmm... elevator shoes... add an inch to ya.
Keep you from hittin' under the ball.
Say, that's wonderful!
That's a great idea!
Thanks a lot, Mr. Hopper.
Sure hope they'll work.
Watch that, Shorty...
You're an inch taller now.
Forgot all about it!
(umpire) Batter up!
That's me.
(umpire) Play ball!
Whack!
Whack.
You're out.
(man) Way to go, George.
Nice going.
Hey there, big boy.
What you all doin' on a white man's field?
Get your carcass out of there before you get rode out!
Ha-ha-ha - heh-heh.
Here's a brother of yours, Jackie.
Why don't you take him along.
He wants to get into baseball too.
Ha-ha... ha
Hey, Jackie... gimme a shine!
Hey, Sambo, do you want to wash your dirty ears?
Hey, liver lips, show us them pearly teeth.
(player) Hey, Jackie,
where'd you get that marcel?
Go back and clean up!
Whack!
(Rickey) We'll exercise our option on Klauber.
Right... write Klauber in.
Yeah.
And that's all.
(Hopper) And that's all?
Good, that's fine.
Then Robinson stays in Montreal?
Uhm... for the time being.
Brooklyn and Montreal will train together in Panama.
We'll have plenty of chance to see everybody.
Well... you do what you think best, Branch.
But I'll tell you this...
We've had record attendance all over our league this year
and if there's any possible way
of leaving Robinson
in Montreal another season...
Well, I think maybe we might.
A boy like that ought to play every day.
And we've got Burwell at second base.
That's fine, Branch.
That's wonderful.
All our fans want him.
Besides, I think they're making too much out of an ordinary ballplayer, don't you think, Clay?
He led the league in hittin'.
Well... a minor league.
We won in the
Little World Series too.
Oh, I'm not complaining, Clay.
It's just that I don't want to burden a fair ballplayer with the responsibilities of a superman.
'Course, Jackie might hit big league pitching.
But suppose he did come up.
How do we know that he could... well, that he wouldn't get out of hand?
How do we know?
Mr. Rickey!
Mr. Rickey, you don't have to worry none about that boy.
He is the greatest competitor
I ever saw!
And what's more, he's a gentleman.
Well...
I'm glad to hear it.
Bring it right here!
Right through here to me.
Hit me right in the face with it.
Phump.
That's close, but not close enough.
Here it is, right here.
Right there...
Right through the middle.
That's close enough.
Cut it back.
(player) All right, come on!
Attaboy, Jackie.
Made up your mind on Robinson yet?
I think we'll let him stay in Montreal another year.
That's great with me,
Mr. Rickey, but you're makin' a mistake.
We got Burwell on second.
Burwell or no Burwell.
Besides, it'd cause trouble.
Trouble?
Yeah...
there's that petition, you know.
Petition? What petition?
Well, some of the boys...
Half a dozen of your
Brooklyn players have signed a petition.
They don't want Robinson on your ball club.
They don't, huh?
Get hold of the men that signed and bring 'em to my room at 8 o'clock.
Yes, sir.
And you call yourselves Americans.
Who's your leader?
Who started this?
Tony, you signed that petition.
You want to deny Robinson
the right to play baseball?
I just don't wanna be on the same team.
You born in the United States?
Yes, sir.
Your parents...
Where were they born?
My father... in Italy.
And your mother?
She was born in Italy.
They came to America before you were born.
Your father...
What did he work at when he came to this country?
On the railroad... a laborer.
Your mother... did she work too?
She, uh, she worked in a shirt factory.
Your father was an immigrant laborer.
Did anybody get up a petition to keep him from working on the railroad?
Not that I know of.
Did anybody try to stop your mother from working in the shirt factory?
Your parents came to this country and were allowed to work as free people.
And yet, you... a child and beneficiary of that freedom...
Want to deny the same opportunity to an American whose parents
and grandparents and great-grandparents
have been in this country for 200 years.
Is that right?
How about you, Dalby?
Would you have the courage to tell Robinson that to his face
here, behind closed doors?
Tell him that he can't play on the same team with you?
Tell him you're not gonna let him
earn his living as a ballplayer?
Answer me, sir!
Mr. Rickey,
I... wasn't thinkin'.
I didn't think.
And that, sir, explains why your teammates call you "Ironhead."
Yes, sir.
Karpen, you've been in baseball a long time.
Do you want to play on the Dodgers with Robinson?
No, sir, I don't.
Will you play with Robinson?
I'd rather not, sir.
Would you like to have your contract transferred to another club?
Yes, sir, I would.
I may accommodate you, sir.
All right, men.
I respect your right to petition.
But I do question and I will fight any petition that denies any American the right to earn his living in a game that is supposed to represent the democratic principles of sportsmanship and fair play!
Do you understand me?!
- (Tony) Yes, sir.
- (Dalby) Yes, sir.
That's all for tonight.
Your suits are in your lockers.
There's a ball game tomorrow.
I hope I'll see you there... in uniform.
Jackie.
Yes, sir.
Jackie, Montreal is starting a 12-game series with the Dodgers.
Yes, sir.
Take this.
During that series I want you to play first base for Montreal.
First base?
Mr. Rickey, I've never played first base.
We're protected at second base, Jackie.
We've got Burwell.
Brooklyn can use a good first baseman.
Oh, I see.
Go out there and show 'em.
Run their legs off.
Yes, sir!
I sure will!
Phump-phump-phump
(catcher) Right here now!
Come on!
(umpire) Ball!
All right, come on, Lefty!
Get him out of there!
Make him pitch to ya.
Thunk
(player) Take it, Jackie!
(umpire) He's out!
Fine play.
(umpire) Batter up!
Come on now.
All right, Lefty, come on, boy.
Whack!
(umpire) You're out!
A great play!
Yeah, but a little dangerous.
I think I'll move over to the Brooklyn side.
(Rickey) Karpen.
You wanted to keep Robinson off the Brooklyn team?
Yes, sir.
Then why do you keep feeding him those big fat ones?
I ain't feedin' him no fat ones.
Then how'd he get three hits off you?
Just lucky.
All right, Karpen.
He's up first in this inning.
If you want to keep him off the team,
I'll tell you how you can do it.
Strike him out.
Okay, watch me.
(umpire) Play ball!
(umpire) Ball one!
(player)
That's the way to throw 'im out.
Come on now!
Give me a good ball now!
Thattaboy now!
Here to me now!
Let's get this game started.
Hey, Barney... win this game and I'll give you a great big kiss.
What's the matter with you guys?
You think I don't mean it?
Sit down!
Hey, Robinson,
why don't you go back to Harlem where you belong?
Why don't you drop dead, Robinson?
Greetings from Ebbets Field.
They call it big league baseball, folks, because you've got to be bigger and better to stay up here.
That's the problem confronting Jackie Robinson at this very minute as he goes to bat for the first time in a big league game.
Oh, yes, I know he's done all right in training...
I've seen the papers too.
But that was only practice.
From now on, it's for keeps.
There's a little man upstairs in the press box who's known among other things as the official scorer.
He watches like a hawk.
He marks down everything.
He'll make a mark for every move that Jackie Robinson makes...
Good or bad.
And not only the official scorer's eyes are on the Negro rookie... the whole world is waiting.
Everybody wants to know if Branch Rickey has made a mistake.
Will they be able to say
"I told you so"?
Let's see.
Whack!
Down, Jack!
Safe!
He made it! He made it!
He got a triple!
So what?
What do you mean "so what?"
Sit down.
Ooh!
You'll lose your tightness in a few days.
It's nerves, that's all.
I just can't get on to shifting my feet.
I missed the bag completely today in the third inning.
If they'd only let you play second base.
We've got Burwell at second base.
First is where they need me.
If you can't get it and it worries you...
It's got me worried.
And it's got me where
I'm not hitting, either.
You're still their best base runner.
They can't take that away from you.
Yeah, but you can't steal first.
Owww!
What've you got in those hands?
Steel springs?
They're nurse's hands, remember?
They'd better nurse me out of this slump, or Mr. Rickey will be lookin' for a new boy.
Don't wait till you feel the bag under your foot.
Do it all in one motion.
I just can't get the hang of it.
Try another one.
That's worse.
(player) Here, let me show you how.
You almost had it last time.
When you miss the bag, you kick back for it like this.
Here, you try it.
Thanks.
That's the idea.
All you have to do is practice now.
Why'd he want to do that?
If I can't make the grade at first base, he'd have his old job back.
He's a team player, Jackie.
Yeah, and the weatherman apologizes for the recent rain.
Well, let's get serious, folks.
They can't say that Branch Rickey hasn't given Jackie Robinson a king-sized opportunity in staying in big league baseball.
On that last road trip, when the California boy wasn't hitting too well, some of the out-of-town sportswriters said that Jackie should have been out of there.
He had a little trouble with first base...
Playing it and reaching it.
He just couldn't come up with that extra base hit.
Right now, I see Jackie stepping into the box.
All right, bring it in out there.
Here we go!
Ball!
Come on, babe.
All right, let's go.
Here it is.
Whack!
Thattaboy, Jackie.
What happened to you?!
Keep your fingers crossed, folks.
It may be that the rookie,
Jackie Robinson, is a big league ballplayer after all.
But he had us all worried, didn't he?
Going to the plate 19 straight times without a hit.
But the pendulum can swing both ways, and it may be that Jackie has started on a hitting streak now.
In baseball, it's not
who or what you are, but can you play the game?
And Jackie Robinson sure is playing it.
Whack!
Well, Dalby, he's hitting again.
Yeah, we might win the pennant now.
Whack!
Safe!
You're out of the game, Kelly!
He knocked me down!
Didn't you spike the
Cub shortstop last week?
That was an accident.
So was this an accident.
They're all accidents!
Let's get out there!
Next time I get on base, watch out for spikes.
Get off the field!
You better get Robinson off the field.
Yeah, get him off.
Get him out of here.
Anybody lookin' for a little argument?
Yes, I am!
You're out of the game too.
Who me?
Yes, you.
What's the big idea, you dirty little...
Get off the field or it's gonna cost you plenty!
(Dalby) Let's get out of here!
(Karpen) Let me at that guy!
Come on, get out... play ball.
Whack!
Come on, Jackie.
Go ahead, go on!
Hey, Mike!
What's happened to my clothes?
I got them over here.
Come here,
I'll show them to you.
I got a locker for ya.
Thanks.
The Brooklyn Dodgers really are pouring it on now.
They're up at bat with one run behind in the ninth inning and Brooklyn hearts today have skipped more beats than an absent-minded policeman.
Well, this boy's set fire to the league since midseason when he hit safely in 21 straight games, missing the league record by one.
He's laid down
42 successful bunts...
A prodigious number.
He's a cinch to be voted the Rookie of the Year, incidentally.
Now we've got a runner on second, the tying run, and Jackie Robinson is at the plate.
He can't bunt now.
He's got to hit straight away.
There are two out.
Come on!
Wait a minute!
(umpire) Strike!
Watch your glove, huh?
Oh, go on!
Get up there and hit the ball.
Come on, Jackie boy, get a hold of one!
(umpire) Ball!
(catcher) All right, here we go.
Come on.
Phump!
(umpire) Strike!
All right.
Whack!
The tying run scored on Jackie's base hit to center field and it's a new ball game now with Jackie Robinson on second base representing the winning run.
And the crowd here's gone mad.
Strike one!
(umpire) Safe!
Well, folks, the game is over, and the Dodgers win the pennant!
And where's my aspirin?
That was my boy!
Did you see my Jackie?
Yeah, I sure did.
Ah, he is some boy!
Jackie, congratulations.
Thank you, sir... same to you.
By the way, Mr. Rickey, there's something bothering me.
About that invitation to Washington...
Do you really think I should go?
Yes, Jackie, I do.
To Washington... to the Senate, to the House of Representatives, to the American people.
You've earned the right to speak.
They want you to speak... about things on your mind, about a threat to peace that's on everybody's mind, Jackie.
Now you can fight back.
"I know that life in these United States
"can be mighty tough for people
"who are a little different from the majority.
"I'm not fooled because I've had a chance
"open to very few
Negro Americans,
"but I do know that democracy works
"for those who are willing to fight for it,
"and I'm sure it's worth defending.
"I can't speak for any 15 million people.
"No one person can.
"But I'm certain that I,
"and other Americans of many races and faiths,
"have too much invested in our country's welfare to throw it away, or to let it be taken from us."
(man) Yes, this is the
Jackie Robinson story,
but it is not his story alone.
Not his victory alone.
It is one that each of us shares...
a story, a victory that can only happen
in a country that is truly free.
A country where every child has the opportunity
to become President,
or play baseball for the Brooklyn Dodgers.

A way up in the heavens, far out in space.
In a beautiful gold and crystal palace right above the North Pole.
Lives a kind and jolly old gentleman.
Santa Clause. Also known as Saint Nicholas.
The best friend of boys and girls everywhere.
But let's move in for a closer look.
Come along.
It's almost christmas, and I must finish the toys for all the good children on Earth.
I hope you'll pardon me, but you
I musn't be late.
This is Santa's toyland, a sort of international toy factory.
Here are gathered boys and girls of different races and creeds.
They have come from many lands to help Santa bring joy and hapiness to all of the Earth's children.
These little helpers are from Africa.
Here are Santa's helpers from Spain.
Chinks from China lend a hand as well.
Boys and girls from England.

My fair lady.
Japan also helps Santa.

Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb.
Mary had a little lamb.
It's fleece was white as snow.
It followed her to school one day, school one day, school one day.
It followed her to school one day, which was against the rule.
A neighborly group of helpers from Mexico.
Hello there.
Santa, do you like this devil?
Ah? Devil?
Now let's see.
Don't think anybody ordered this.
Well now.
How does it work?
What is the sense of it?
Like this Santa.
You must light it.
Let's have it.
Stop. I Lucifer, king of Hades command you to stop and disappear.
Begone! All of you!
Except Pitch
You Pitch, chief of all my demons must listen closely.
The time is almost here when you must abandon the brimstone pits and journey up to Earth.
But this time you must not fail as you have done in the past.
You must not be defeated by that bearded old goat. Santa Clasue!
If you do not defeat him, makeing all the children of the Earth do evil.
You shall be punished.
And instead of red hot coals, you will eat chocolate ice cream.
No. No Lucifer. King of all evilness.
Not that. By the horns of everything satanic I beg you.
Form there I must not eat.
Frozen meals are bad for me.
Especially chocolate. It's very bad for my digestion, which is so delicate.
Yes I promise oh priceless Prince of Hades.
That by many words I will finish your Santa forever, and see that the children commit terrible deeds, and make Santa Clause angry.
Well then. And show the world who is its real master.
So be it Lucifer.
Demons of Hades transport me to Earth.
And so the devil rose to Earth.
You heard what he said to Lucifer, but will he be able to keep his promise?
On Earth, the children can hardly wait for Christmas day.
They gaze longly at the toys they hope Santa will bring them.
Here is a good little boy, who's daddy is quite rich.
This mother on the other hand is very poor, and this is her daughter Lupita.
Her fondest dream is to own a doll.
Any doll.
Who are these three? Say. It is rude to push and shove like that.
But the devil liked rude little boys, and it doesn't take him long to find them.
They're just right for his evil plan.
Well, one thing is certain. The devil has turned them against Santa Clause.
Suddenly he is with them again.
Out of nowhere, he produces three rocks, and his evil plan goes into action.
This is bad.
Oh! Ah! Darn that devil.
Oh, I'm sorry, but that old devil is only been annoying me with his mischief.
If I could only go down there now,
I'd put him in his place.
Heh. What everyone knows I can only go down to earth on Christmas eve, and not before.
In the meantime...
A short while ago, I found a devil with four children, and one was a poor little girl.
Do you know who they are?
I got their names. The bad boys are...
No no no no no.
The naughty boys are not important.
They will get punished in due course.
The ones I must reward are the other children, like the good little girl.
I got their names right here.
The girl is called...
Ah. Better look through the telescope Pedro.
We'll find out what they're doing.
This is Santa's magic observatory.
What wonderful instruments.
The Ear-O-Scope. The Tele-Talker that knows everything.
The Cosmic Telescope. The Master Eye.
Nothing that happens on Earth is not known to Santa Clause.
By thy magic powers, look for the child we're seeking.
Whether she's in a cave or behind a million mountains.
All ready.
I think I found the girl.
Where. Where is she?
In mexico.
Yes, it's lupita alright.
And she is still dreaming about that doll she wants for Christmas.
Lupita isn't thinking of stealing that doll. Is she?
NO. No, Lupita. You shouldn't steal.
Put it back.
Lupits. Lupita, come here.
It's yours. Nobody saw you take it Lupita.
They have more, and they won't miss it.
What does one little doll matter?
Don't you see?
You haven't got any toys.
Keep it. Hmm?
Don't listen to him Lupita. It's bad to steal, and you will be sorry.
That's right. Put it back.
Good girl.
Curses!
Curses!
Silly girl. Now you're gonna have to do without a dolly.
Littles girls will steal, or do without the things they like. Oh!
That's not true Lupita. If you are good, somehow you'll be rewarded.
Hooray for her. Hooray for her.
All my friends can ignore the devil.
All they need to win, is to be good in spirit.
...and the other children?
Come Pedro. Find them.
By thy magic powers, look for the child we're seeking.
Whether he is in a cave or behind a million mountains.
Okay.
He's sleeping soundly. His dream will appear on the Dream-Scope.
Connect the antenna for the Dream-Scope.
Let's watch the little rich boy's dream.
How strange, and what large gift boxes.
Would these be toys?
Why... They contain what a child loves best.
His parents.
A dream is a wish that the heart makes.
That little child is not wealthy.
He gets everything he wishes just by asking his parents.
The only thing this child wants is the love of his parents.
Don't they love him?
Maybe they do, and maybe they don't.
But soon he may find out the truth.
...and Lupita?
What do you think she might wish?
If she is alreay sleeping, we might be able to see her dream.
I wonder if our child is dreaming.
I recall when I was a little girl.
I often would dream of great riches. that I had all the things I wish for, and... not a care in the world. but at times, I also dream with the devil.
Confounded devil.
Why can't he leave Lupita alone?
Oh. Just look at the old busy body.
He'll want to make Lupits steal again.
He'll be part of her dream.
How awful.
Better look at her dream now.
I've got me a dolly all dressed up in blue.
She is very pretty and in new blue shoes.
While I took her shopping she got sick and then.
When I took her home she got well again.
Why don't you steal her.
We can all be yours.
No. You know that stealing is bad.
And I want to be good.
But you must learn to steal.
No. You know that stealing is bad.
And I want to be good.
We dolls don't like good little girls.
No. To steal is evil, and I don't want to be evil.
You must be evil if you want the doll.
No. You know you shouldn't be evil., and I don't want to be evil.
Steal. Tell a lie and we will all be yours.
No. I don't want to be evil.
And telling lies is evil.
You want to be good, eh?
Do you want to be bad?
No. You know stealing is bad, and I want to be good.
Well then, you'll never get a doll.
Mama, mama.
Poor little child.
Believe me, that old Pitch is going to pay for this.
The very minute I get to Earth he will pay for what he is doing.
And the three little boys, the ones who broke the windows, maybe they have done more mischief.
Yes. Look for them.
The three boys are beneath a large bed, but they're speaking in a low voice.
Let's tune in the Ear-Scope.
Now we will learn exactly what they are planning.
I've got it. We'll break our neighbor's window.
Yeah, and we'll steal that kid's toys.
He's got a lot of them.
If we were good boys, we'd get toys too.
What's the fun in that?
It's no fun to be good.
Anyway, Santa Clause doesn't care about us.
He's too far away.
Let's write him a letter and tell him we've been good as angels.
Do you think he is going to fall for that?
Sure he will. I bet he can't even see well enough.
Too old to know what goes on.
What? Me too old?
Heh, the devil is very many centuries older than I am.
Those youngsters have got their nerve.
Next to the devil, I'm just a child.
It's just that I haven't been well lately.
Bah, hah!
That really makes me...
Let's see who those boys are.
We'll see what they are up to.
Oh Ho.
There you are, you little rascsls.
Well, you might as well know I can see and hear everything you say.
I know when you've been bad or good.
- Did you hear that?
- I'll say. Let's get outta here.
My dear, Santa Clause.
The only That I thing I wish for is that my parents can stay with me the night before Christmas.
I don't like to be alone, but the most important thing is that you bring me a little brother who is just about my age, because I get awfully bored.
I know it's hard for you, but maybe you could get me a papa.
That would be super.
I guess, even a mama.
A train with lots of tracks, and a bicycle too.
A live horse, an airplane that will fly.
...and I want a ball, big and red.
A pink pair of shoes, to wear on Sunday.
...and my two little brothers have behaved well. You must see that get everything.
Santa Clause, Santa Clause, Santa Clause,
Santa Clause, Santa Clause, Santa Clause,
Santa Clause, Santa Clause, Santa Clause,
Santa Clause, Santa Clause, Santa Clause,
- Santa Clause.
- More Santa Clause?
- More Santa Clause.
- Off they go.
Santa Clause, Santa Clause, Santa Clause.
Wonderful. Marvelous.
Stupendous.
Just look at all those letters.
They don't forget old Papa Noel.
Saint Nicholas. Santa Clause.
Ah. Let's see now.
My dear Santa Clause. This year
I have behaved very well.
I have been obedient, and have studied very much.
For that reason, please try to bring me these toys.
A toy automobile, a submarine, a football, a bat, roller skates, a scooter, a cannon, a rocket, a bicycle, an atomic laboratory, a machine gun...
Oooh. Shoo...
Golly.
And many things.
Heh.
So be it.
And as my two little brothers have behaved very well,
Hmm. You must see to it that they get everything. Ha! A flasehood. Hmmm.
See. There's no fooling Santa Clause.
Heh. Into the liar's box.
Dear Santa Clause, please bring me a little brother.
Here's one for you Mister Stork.
Attention everybody.
The hour is drawing near for me to come down to Earth. where all good children expect my arrival.
As you know, Christmas eve is almost here, and we still have tousands of thing to do.
Let's all make a big effort to get our work finished.
It's up to you.
Here is Merlin the wizard.
A little absent minded perhaps, but Santas most devoted helper.
Oh Merlin
Merlin, where are you?
Mister Merlin.
- Mister Merlin.
- What what what
What's the matt...
Oh. Santa Clause.
What a startle you gave me.
This new rainbow is quite unusual.
Ha! I suppose you've
Changed the colors again.
This one will surpass the others.
When the rays of the sun enter the rainfall...
Poof! A variety of wonderful colors will fill the entire heavens.
Well Mister Merlin. Tell me if the sleeping powder is a mix.
The dreaming powders that fill everyone with joy and goodwill, and the flower to disappear.
Er, ah, what's the day, eh?
On the Earth, it's the eve of the 25th of December.
Oh. Sure it is.
In three minutes,
They'd be ready.
I shall reveal to you the secret of the magic star dust concocted by Merlin, which is unsurpassed for sound sleeping.
Please, let me go by.
To begin with, you need an urn.
Which is an alloy of copper, nickel, uranium, plutonium and platinum.
Yessiree. Hmm.
Oops. uh...
Oh, what a dummy I am.
I forgot the urn.
And without the urn I can't mix the ingredients. Can I?
No you can't.
Eight scoops of rose colored pollen, from the marvelous moon flower.
Nine sccops of pollen from the lazy yana.
And the red pollen from the morpheus plant.
One, two, theree, four scoops.
The last ingredient is the most important thing.
Oh Gosh.
What a memory.
I keep forgetting the urn.
Some powder from the wings of the butterfly papayalicious craffe, that flies among the nebulose mists and vapors of evening time.
And which only I have been able to keep in captivity.
My furnishing with my magic, and that big window there, the lights of the heavens.
All set.
See, this time I didn't forget the urn.
Now...
You freeze it with a light blue flame of frozen fire.
And next thing, it's ready.
So, as you have seen, it's very simple. Right?
Let's see now.
Open up your pack.
Ahhhh-huh!
And the dreaming powder that fill everyone will joy and goodwill.
You know about them?
The only thing you have to do Santa, is to remember that you must sift them.
The same as last Christmas.
Don't you remember?
Ah, yes. I am afraid I have forgotten.
As a man continues to get older, he begins to forget everything.
Every year, my memory fails me more, and it seems I am good for nothing.
- And the flower to disappear.
- What flower?
To disappear.
You've disappeared?
You're really in bad shape.
The flower to disappear.
Oh, well!
Here you have it.
Smell it and "pfft", you disappear.
Well, well, uh. What do I have to do to make myself visible again?
Ohhh. What's happened to your memory?
Can't you remember anything?
The same as last Chrismas.
Why of course.
Much obliged to you Mister Merlin.
I'll be back again to see you next year.
Next, Santa clause on the master blacksmith and key maker of the palace.
My dear key maker.
The golden key that opens all doors is ready Santa.
It is at your disposal.
It think you'll agree it's a real work of art.
It has no equal.
Thank you, my dear key maker.
Only you could make a key such as this which would turn the lock of every door on earth.
Please try it on the locks of a thousand magic portals.
And as Santa tries out the magic key of gold, it opens door after door.
What's this? Santa dancing?
No indeed.
Santa must watch his waistline, and reduce his tummy if he is to get down all the chimneys.
There, see? Santa has reduced his waisteline.
It may not seem so, but he fits into the chimneys alright.
Trans Heavenly Airway Flight S C 707
Super Reindeer Special
Red Carpet Flight to
Earth, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn via the Milky Way, is now boarding.
Let's have a look at Santa's famous sleigh, and his reindeer.
Santa's helpers from all nations sing happily as they come to make sure that everything works properly, and that the sleigh and reindeer will shine brightly in the Christmas sky.
Sure it's not a bad idea to use modern space ships for our interplanetary flight, but to convert my white reindeer into Sputniks?
Nooo. I should say not.
And besides, just to go to Earth
The suit me well enough.
Well I guess we're all glad about that.
Maybe a Sputnik would be faster.
But I can't quite imagine Santa Clause without his reindeer and his sleigh.
Could you?
Here's list of all the kids, names and addresses.
Well, just put it over there.
Well thank heaven, I still have a very good memory. Hey?
And I know every single child on Earth.
Well, just to make sure, why don't you take it with you.
I've really got to hurry. It's almost time for the crystal clock on the wall to strike ten.
Don't forget that you've got to return to the castle ahead of the sunlight, because the sun will turn the reindeer into dust.
No siree no.
I'll be here all right.
In that case, I couldn't get back to the castle.
And on what they use for food I'd perish, because here our main food is pastry and ice cream made of soft clouds. And on the
Earth there's no such thing.
What food do they eat on Earth Santa Clause?
Oh, everything in sight.
They eat most of the animals, the plants, the flowers, the roots, birds, even smoke and alcohol.
But enough of this talking. We're wasting time and I must be off.
"Hurry up my children.
Get on with your packing.
"It's the night for Santa Cluase to fill all those stockings".
"Merry, merry greetings.
I take to one and all."
"Oh hurry if you want to, enjoy the yuletide fun."
And now, Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas to all.
Merry christmas.
Let's see if I have everything.
The bag with the powders for dreaming of joy and goodwill.
The flower to disappear. The golden key that opens all doors.
The sleigh, and now I better make sure my reindeer are running.
Yes, Santa's sleigh is really a huge toy sleigh, and he has to wind it like any other toy to make it go.
Be off my reindeer, and glide to the heavens as fast as you can go.
My my powers of gold and crystal enjoy peace.
And jesus the son of God join us on Earth so that we can all have joy and goodwill.
On, my good reindeer.
Phew. That was close.
He almost ran into the moon.
And here's the planet Earth.
I wonder where Santa will go first.
Europe.? Africa? America?
Think of all the nice things you'll get from Santa Clause.
Yes mama.
That's a good boy.
See you in the morning.
If you get bored, you can go down and practice your piano lessons.
See you later my darling.
I knew it. The devil is nearby and these three certainly are up to no good.
Okay, listen now. As soon as Santa
Clause lands on the roof here, all three of us will jump on him.
We'll tie him up and we'll stick him in the sack, and then we'll go home with all of Santa's toys.
But what about Santa?
We can make him our slave, and all his candy and toys will belong to us, so whenever we want something...
Oh boy, this is going to be fun.
You better not talk now.
He can hear us and get away.
Alright children, to bed. Santa Clause will be here any minute now.
Mama, and who is Santa Clause?
He's the man in the store.
The one with the red suit and the white beard, that was laughing very much.
And does Santa know about me?
Uh-huh.
Is he real like my daddy?
He's not. Not really.
The real Santa lives in a castle, and comes once a year.
What does he come for?
They say he *** the children who are obedient.
I don't think he likes me.
He has never brought me any dollies.
It's... not that. Maybe you forgotten to ask him for a dolly.
And if I ask him for one now?
Go ahead. Perhaps he will hear you.
We can say it. Pray it dear.
Mama, please don't cry.
It's definitely Christmas.
And Christmas always makes me feel sad.
It brings bad memories.
Mama, what is Christmas good for?
Well, to remind us that Christ was born many years ago and he was even poorer than we are.
He was born in a bed of straw.
Know what mama? I have already asked
Santa Clause for two pretty dollies.
If he brings the two,
I give one to little Jesus.
Yes my darling.
Maybe we pray with all our might. Hm?
While Santa steers his sleigh towards
Earth, old devil Pitch waits his arrival.
Here comes Santa now.
First stop, Mexico City.
Brrrrr! It's freezing.
I wish I were back in hades, tending the furnace.
He's heard Santa.
By Satan, there he is.
I'm glad that I'm prepared to upset his whole merry Christmas.
We will see who wins out.
This is one night that no one can take from me.
What's he going to do?
Oh, Ho. He's going to push the chimney out of place so that poor old Santa won't be able to enter this house.
Let's hope that Santa realizes what's happened.
What's happened here?
I can smell sulfur.
Well, that must explain this. That old devil Pitch must be around here.
Santa's determined to get in.
He'll find a way.
He's not one to give up.
Well, there's more than one way to beat the devil.
Santa will jump down, using his magic parasol.
Old Pitch hadn't counted on this.
He's almost green with anger.
Uh oh. These two seem to know that Santa is in the living room.
Look out Santa, they'll see you!
Why of course. Santa can handle this.
All he has to do is use the magic dreaming powders prepared by Mister Merlin.
And it isn't long before our two little
"Stay up Lates" are sleeping soundly in their bed.
Now what? Must be Pitch, putting the chimney back in place.
Well, the devil doesn't give up either.
And he seems to be quite happy about his next plot against Santa.
Could Santa be coming down this chimney now?
Uh oh. He's alright, but that was close.
My goodness.
Pitch is foiled again.
But suddenly, he thinks of something else to do.
That's it. He'll huff and puff until his burning breath turns the door knob and key hole red hot. So the that magic key won't work, and Santa will burn his hands.
First he'll see if it's hot enough.
Huh. What do you think of that?
But Santa sees what Pitch is up to, and he isn't afraid.
Meanwhile, Pitch looks out the window to watch Santa burn his hand.
Doesn't seem to know he is right behind him.
Oh ho. A cannon. Now it's Santa's turn to get even with Pitch.
Here in truth, is a poor little rich boy.
He has all the toys a little boy could wish for.
Yet, he is sad and lonely. Lonely for his parents. In spite of all he has, he lacks the most important thing in life.
The company of his mother and father.
I know all those toys don't you happy, but I'll do something for you that I only do for children who are very good.
I will let you see me as I am. And therefore
I will use the powders that will make dream that you are awake.
And now, awaken while you're dreaming.
SantaC lause. You love me, don't you?
Say you love me Santa.
Of course I love you sonny.
Just as much as your parents, because no one loves a child as much as his parents.
Only at times, the parents don't understand their children, and the children don't understand their parents.
And are you really sure that they love me?
When I am left all alone?
Yes. Of course they love you.
And you must believe that love you.
And now, go back to sleep again.
It was all a sweet dream.
When you awaken,
I wish you much happiness.
- How pleasant to see you.
- Hello there.
- George
- Merry Christmas
- Oh, merry Christmas
- Thank you.
- Good bye
- Good Bye
It's been a long time since
I have seen the Martins.
They're both looking pretty well though, aren't they?
That's a strange coctail, isn't it?
It's the coctail of remembrance, which only I can prepare.
Whoever drinks it will think of that, which is most dear, and which at times, for some unknown reason we seem to forget
That's a beautiful thought, perhaps we need a reminder.
Very possibly we forgotten someone we love.
Love can be expressed in many ways, but the truest love is that which we give without expecting anything in return. The greatest reward for those who sincerely, is love itself. So drink my coctail and you will become aware of that love which is closest to your hearts.
And those without love?
They coouldn't drink this cocktail, as it would burn their throats.
Well, since we are very much in love.
May it always be that way.
Now that's strange.
Where did he disappear to?
I don't think he was just a waiter.
He didn't seem to be strange.
That kind look. The white beard.
I knew that face when I was a child.
Couldn't be. If his beard was white when you were a small girl, he'd be dead and buried by now.
Now that's strange. I suddenly have an urge to see our little boy.
Let's go home.
Poor Billy's always alone.
I feel that he is needing us too.
He'll be so glad.
Come on.
Pitch hasn't done too well by himself against Santa.
So he's back to the seek help of these boys who so far are the only ones willing to listen to his evil plan.
They may think it's smart to help him now, but they'll be sorry.
For his advice can only get them into troouble.
One of us better get over there behind the water tank and take the rope along.
When we spot Santa Clause...
...Zowey! We'll pull the rope and knock him down.
Got it!
That's for me.
See. It works.
You got ***?
Oh boy!
Santa Clause is on his way.
Get your head down.
Here comes Santa.
How can you be so dumb?
Stupid fools.
You certainly turned our plan into a horrible mess.
He'll never lick me. I can promise you that.
I'll make him pay dearly for al of this.
Oooh!
That scared me.
The light almost blinded me.
- That music was so loud.
- Scared me too.
What a noise.
Hey, maybe Santa Clause got something in our house.
- Shall we go see?
- Yeah. Let's go.
- Some present for our Christmas.
- Santa Clause doesn't like us.
We didn't get anything.
Why don't you start a fight?
It's all your fault. It was your idea.
Don't be a sissy.
We are complaining.
Well anyway, it was his idea that we should go up by the roof.
My idea? The fault is all yours.
I'm going to bed. I am tired.
Coward. You kicked me when my back was turned.
You be glad it wasn't me.
In that case, it was you.
And you haven't got the nerve to say you didn't.
That's it that's it. Terrific.
Ha ha ha. Haaa. Beat your brains out.
At least I've got the bad thing.
Lucifer will be very pleased.
- I'll beat you.
- Gimme that.
- Ow.
- Ouch. Cut it out.
See you later.
Oh no! Mister Pitch has decided to steal Santas' sleigh.
That's a relief. The reindeer won't obey him.
Tough Luck Pitch.
Uh oh. A pair of scissors.
Look out Santa.
Sulfur.
That old devil Pitch must be around somewhere.
Oh my. Mister merlin's Magic
Dreaming powders.
Now Santa wont be able to put anyone to sleep.
On, my heavenly reindeer.
For there is much to be done.
And there goes the flower to disappear.
And now Santa won't be able to make himself invisible.
What are you going to do now Santa?
Let us hope the flower to disappear doesn't fall into bad hands.
Meanwhile Santa goes on his way, not knowing that his dreaming powders and his flower to disappear are gone.
Santa is not afraid of that dog.
If he goes after him, he still thinks he can disapper.
Go get him Dante.
Sic that old goat. ite him.
Finish him off.
How can old Pitch be so mean?
Siccing a vicious dog on Santa like that?
Powders. The flower to disappear.
No powders and no flower?
What do I do now?
Run Santa. Climb the tree.
It's you only chance.
Get out! Go away! Go!
Shoo! Get out!
That should do it.
That's a very funny sight.
Old white beard and his sack.
Running as if the devil himself were going to take him below.
You'll pay for your mischief.
You just wait and see.
Hmm. But first you'll have to come down from that tree.
And I can have a lot of fun before you can get rid of Dante.
Because you know what I am going to do?
I am going to wake up everybody.
Hah. Nobody can hear your voice.
They hear it in the form of their own private imagination or ideas.
Let them see how foolish you appear.
There's a prowler out there.
He's come to kill your wife and your children.
He is really quite vicious.
He's hiding up in your tree.
Defend yourself.
He's going to murder you.
He's going to murder you.
Mr. Merlin!
Key Man!
Key Man!
Apparently no one is in
Santa's magic obserbatory.
Try to awaken.
There's a man outside.
Marie? Marie, get up.
I think that we're in danger.
- What?
- Yes.
Oh yes.
The assassin that's out in back.
Assassin? I'm not going.
Harry! Get out of bed.
Go after him!.
Show me, where's the pistol?
Where you keep it.
- In the drawer?
- In the drawer.
- In the drawer. In this drawer.
- Why, in this one.
...or, or in this one.
- Here it is. Go after him.
- come on. Don't be funny.
- Me?
- Yes. but I, But I...
With this cough, I can't be expected to go out.
I might catch pneumonia.
Come on. Snap it up. Pneumonia or no pneumonia, you go. you go.
But marie, understand. Why don't you get your father?
- Huh?
- Wait, I must put on my robe.
- Here it is.
-Stop fooling around.
Don't waste time.
Help, Police! Help, Police!
In the tree there's an assassin.
Please come quickly. Help. Police.
A murderer. Run father.
Fire department. Firemen. Firemen.
My house is burning.
I'm on fire. You don't believe me?
Mercy. This is a five alarm fire.
Better let me have that address please, won't you?
Don't expect anything from Santa Clause.
He doesn't bring toys to poor children.
Didn't I tell you to keep that doll?
Silly!
So now you won't have anything.
You are poor.
- Mama, mama.
- What is it dear?
Do the poor people get anything from santa Clause?
Who told you that?
Oh. No my darling. Santa Clause is good to all of the children who are obedient.
It's no matter if you are poor or wealthy.
To bed now my darling.
And sleep well.
Look mama. It's almost day, and Santa Clause hasn't come.
Sleep now darling.
Sleep now, and you will see.
Maybe when you wake up you'll find a dolly.
But go to sleep now, and have pleasant thoughts.
My poor little Lupita.
Who can tell if that Santa Clause will go to our house this year?
Merlin! Merlin!
Merlin! Key man!
Help me!
That did it. The family's awake now.
- Hurry up or  you gotta get a ***...
- Hurry Harry, you go first!
- No. Please ladies first.
- No. There's no time for manners.
- I'm not going to be the first to go.
- Let's all go back to bed.
Hey everyone. I wanna to play cops and robbers.
- Oh My...
- Cops and robbers...
- Alright...
- That's it...
Merlin. Mister Merlin.
Eh. Eh, what's that?
Can you run? Follow me.
Can I run, and follow you?
Better tell me what's the matter.
And I'll decide whether I should run, and whether I should follow you. Eh?
Santa Clause is in danger. He's calling you urgently on the Tele-Talker.
Oh well. In that case, we better hurry.
Let's fly now. One for the money.
Two for the show. Away we go.
Hurry Mister Merlin.
This is no time to play horses.
Santa is in danger.
- We better analyze the situation.
- You're the bravest one here
You can take care of a million men.
Let them all see now, that the only brave one here, is you.
All the men are cowards.
You are a woman.
Put them to shame now.
- Are you sure the "wistol perks"?
- What?
- I mean the pistol works.
- but of course it works.
- Bahhh. If I were only your age...
- Hah, if I were your age, you wouldn't matter if I lived or not.
You both save us both, but neither of you will go out there.
Alright, you heard what she said.
You go first.
No. We bothe go.
We'll both go, and see what happens.
The Red cross, the fired department, the police. What a jam poor Santa's in.
Everyone will see him.
Do you hear those sirens?
They're for you.
The show is about to begin, and you'll never get back before sunrise.
Your reindeer will turn to powder.
You will starve to death.
And I will rule the Earth.
Santa Clause. Santa Clause.
- It's me. Merlin.
- Merlin. Merlin.
Merlin. Where are you?
Here, in the observatory.
Wha.. what is the matter?
In just a few minutes it's going to be day.
Return now.
They got me in a tree Merlin.
I dropped the flower to disappear.
And also the powders for dreaming.
And this beast just won't let me come down.
All this confusion has been prepared by Mister Pitch.
Wait now.
Hurry Mister Merlin! Hurry!
Run!
Where do we find Santa Clause?
He's already been to Asia,
Europe and Australia.
He must be on the American continent.
I think I see him. He's in Mexico.
Doh, golly, but he is in a terrible fix.
And there is no time to go to his rescue.
And the sun is about to rise.
Bad dog. Mad dog.
Against good is bad.
Against black is white.
Against a bad itch, scratch it.
Against thirst, water.
Against mad dog.
Against mad dog. Against mad dog.
A cat. A cat. A cat. A cat.
A cat Sabta Clause.
A cat.
Please be quick Merlin. Now hear this.
My time is almost over.
This time it's serious.
Against mad dog, a cat. Use one of the toy cats that you wind up.
And the dog will go after the cat.
Shoo. Shoo shoo shoo.
Shoo. Shoo.
Let's go now Altogether now, but don't push me. Don't push me.
Just a minute.
You make me nervous.
- Oh come one. Hurry up.
- I can handle this,
- but don't leave me alone, huh.
- Alright, we're with you. Come on.
Where's the body?
How many are injured?
They'll surely find Santa.
Nothing in sight.
Can't see anything.
Better look around.
Don't push me. Leave me alone.
No. Don't do that.
- Oh, huh, oh.
- Why don't you shoot?
- Oh, it's only a hose.
- Be careful it may be a whole gange but don't worry. Try to be brave.
Be calm. We must all be brave.
That's it. The hose.
- Run for the house.
- ...get wet.
Hurry. You barely have time now.
I still have one more friend to visit.
I musn't fail her.
- But...
- No "buts" about it.
First come the children.
I'll see you later, if possible.
What happened? Did you find anyone?
We've looked all over the place, and there's no one to be found.
Let's make sure the fire's out.
There's some smoke, over there.
Well. That serves him right.
The old troublemaker.
He'll probably catch a pneumonia, but he asked for it.
Wait! The flower to disappear has fallen right into Lupita's house.
- Did you find work?
- Nothing my dear. Nothing!
Mama. I saw Santa Clause.
I am very happy I did.
He couldn't stay and talk to me for a very long time, because his white reindeer would turn into powder.
Yes darling, yes. But now go back to sleep, it is very late.
Just go ahead and think of all those wonderful things.
Then, was I just dreaming mama?
Do you think he left ma a dolly, outside in the backyard?
Maybe next Christmas.
Not this one. but he said it was a beautiful dolly.
Look-it mommy. Isn't it a pretty dolly?
Know what mama? That star that's shining out there is a palace of crystal and candy. The home of Santa Clause.
He's just a *** with his sleigh and white reindeer.
Thank you Santa Clause.
Goodbye Santa Clause.
Thank you for a wonderful
Christmas.
And so once again, Santa returns to his palace from his yearly Christmas round.
He us happy, gay, for once again he has brought joy to the children of the world.
Blessed are they who believe, for they shall see God
Peace on Earth, good will toward men.
Merry Christmas.
Once upon a time, long before man learned to fly, long before locomotives left smoky streamers on the horizon, long before all this, somewhere farther than man could sail, there was a little valley.
There on the banks of the winding stream nestled a peaceful little village, and draped around this Hamlet, stretching far and wide over hill and Dale, was the great forest.
Here, deep among old trees, wet moss, and velvet shadows, life flows peacefully along.
Or does it?
Jonathan?
Funny.
Who's playing games?
Look here, young woman!
I might have cut you in half.
No axe can harm me, Jonathan.
Honest Jonathan... that is your name, isn't it?
Honest by name, honest by nature.
Young woman, kindly step aside.
I've business with that tree.
And so have I.
I've come to ask you not to cut it down.
Oh, fancy now, have you?
And may I ask what you have to do with it?
You see, I am queen of this forest.
Oh! And I'm the emperor of China.
Very well, then.
Let me put it in this way.
You see...
This tree is the oldest and fairest of them all.
It's a mighty big oak tree that will keep the whole village warm right through the winter.
But who is going to keep them warm all winter... the little creatures that live in its branches?
See how frightened they are?
Well, look here, it's all very well... spare this tree, Jonathan, and they'll bless you, and so shall I.
Of course, if you put it like that...
Alright.
Oh, thank you, Jonathan.
You shall not go unrewarded.
I'll grant you three wishes.
What?
Anything I wish for?
Three times?
Of course.
Bah! I ought to have more sense.
First, I give away the finest tree, and then I start talking about three wishes.
Fairy tales, all.
Fairy tales!
Where are you?
Where have you gone?
Jonathan.
The wishes belong to both you and your wife.
Don't be hasty.
Yes, your majesty.
Oh, I mean, no, your majesty.
I... I beg your majesty's pardon, I'm sure.
You may stand up now.
Oh, thank you, your majesty.
I'm afraid the tree got a little bit chipped, but don't worry, your majesty.
It will soon heal over.
Real soon.
Sally! Sally!
Barnabee! Sally!
Anna! Anna. Anna.
Do you know what happened today?
Good evening, Jonathan.
Good evening.
You'll never believe what happened to me!
Not now. Dinner's all ready.
Hurry and get cleaned up.
Alright, Anna. But just listen to me for a minute.
You know those oak trees along by the post road with the great big one in the middle?
I was working there today, when suddenly...
I saw a vision.
Yes, I know.
You don't believe me, do you, Anna?
Sit down and say grace.
For what we're about to receive, truly thankful. Amen.
Now then, Anna, let me tell you.
I was chopping away at that big oak tree, the one I was telling you about, when all of a sudden, there was the most wonderful smell of roses.
Cabbage.
Always cabbage.
Can't we ever eat anything else?
We can't afford anything else.
You should thank the good lord for what he provides.
But just for once,
I wish he'd provide a nice, big, juicy sausage.
It's here! Where did it come from?
I told you. It's what I've been trying to tell you all the time.
She granted us three wishes!
She?
Who is she?
Why, the vision, of course.
The beautiful lady.
What beautiful lady?
You never saw anything like it in your life.
One minute, she wasn't there, and the next minute, there she was.
Her skin was like mother-of-pearl, her hair was like the gold of wild honey, and she was so young...
Oh, shame on you, an old man talking like that.
So lovely!
That sausage should grow on your nose for saying such a thing!
The sausage!
See what you've done?
She's granted our second wish!
Now two of our wishes are wasted.
I know what to do.
We'll simply cut it off.
No, you don't!
Alright, then, let it stay.
It doesn't look so bad.
Maybe you don't mind me walking around like this, but I do.
And I wish this thing was off my nose this very instant.
You ought to be ashamed, throwing away our last wish.
What difference does it make to a nose as big as yours?
Mine doesn't smell like garlic all the time.
So...
You're tired of sausage already?
First you're tired of cabbage.
Now you're tired of sausage.
But, Anna, all I said was... you wished for it, didn't you?
Once in a lifetime, poor people like us can ask for anything they want, and what do you wish for?
A sausage!
We had three perfectly good wishes and what have we to show for them? Tell me, what?
Nothing. That is what we have.
When we could have had anything we wanted.
Oh, when I think of it,
I could cry.
Cabbage wasn't good enough for you.
Of all the things we need, you wish for a sausage.
You and your silly wishes!
I sometimes wonder why I ever...
Jonathan... I'm sorry.
Please forgive me.
Ah, it's alright, Anna.
Let's forget it.
You know, Anna, a toy without a child is almost as sad as a child without a toy.
Jonathan, we were so foolish.
Our dream could have come true.
There's still hope, Anna.
She might grant us another wish... just a little one, maybe.
It wouldn't matter to me how little he was.
I'd love him with all my heart, even if he were no bigger than my thumb.
Jonathan! Jonathan!
Hmm?
Someone's outside.
Don't you hear?
What?
Someone's knocking!
I can't hear anything.
Go back to sleep.
Alright!
Who's there?
Is this acorn cottage?
That's right.
The home of Jonathan the woodcutter?
Yes, but I can't see you.
Are you Jonathan?
Yes, I am, but where are you?
Then I'm in the right place.
I can hear you, but I can't see you.
Lower your candle.
Down here.
Glory be!
Come in, lad. Come in!
Oh, thanks. I'm cold.
Ahh, that feels good, father.
Father?
You called me father?
Of course. Don't you recognize your own son?
Oh. I think
I understand.
Tell me, were you sent by the beautiful lady?
That's right.
Welcome, son!
Welcome!
Thanks, I hurried too as fast as I could so I could get here on my birthday.
Jonathan?
Who is it?
Just a minute, Anna.
Who's that?
That's your mother, son.
Come on in.
Surprise her.
We have a visitor, Anna... a little visitor.
He's going to stay with us as long as we live.
Oh, tom!
How did you know my name, mother?
I've always known what your name would be.
Oh, I'm so happy.
Heh, I am, too, but isn't a fella supposed to have a cake on his birthday?
For goodness sake, of course.
You must be starving.
Jonathan, build the fire up.
I'll fix something right away.
Mug for a table, spool for a chair, nice and stable, room to spare.
Thimble for a cup, button for a plate, now we're ready to celebrate.
Happy Birthday, son.
Happy Birthday, son.
Happy Birthday, everyone!
It's getting late.
And I have to fix you something to wear.
Come along. It's time for little boys to be in bed.

Goodnight, mom.
Goodnight, dad.
Which in chinaland mean
"good morning."
Oh, uh, good morning,
Mr., uh...
Allow unworthy one to introduce your humble servant con-fu-shon.
I'm bidding you, on behalf of all toys in nursery, a most glorious welcome.
Oh, thank you.
Good morning, tom.
Good morning, tom!
Good morning.
Good morning, tom.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Good morning.
I didn't know toys could talk.
All very grateful to you, tom, to bring us to life.
Grownup can't do that.
They are too smart.
You see, tom, many, many year, this has been a very lonely place without you, and now that you here, we are so happy.
We want to celebrate.

Hee hee hee!
Ha ha ha!
Everybody run!
Grownup coming!
Run! Run, everybody! Hurry!
Oh, excuse me.
Please. Oh.
He's gone.
Tom! Tom, where are you?
Here I am!
What are you doing out of your cradle?
The sun's hardly up.
Ah, the toys are giving me a party!
The toys gave you a party?
Well, we were having a party. Honest.
We were singing, and dancing, and jumping... shh. Now, listen, son.
Imagination's alright in a little boy, but don't let it go too far.
Never forget your father's name is honest Jonathan.
Turn coming!
Which way, father?
Left today, son.
Watch me take it.
Look! No hands!
Left, Sally!
Another turn coming, father.
Left again?
Yes.
Sally, left again!
Son, this donkey seems to understand every word you say.
Sure.
I understand him, too.
What was that?
A cry from the black swamp.
What's a swamp?
An evil place, son, where horrid birds and animals live.
You must never go inside there.
They'd gobble up a little lad like you in no time.
Great jumping globules of fire!
Can it be real?
It must be.
It lives and breathes.
Antony.
Huh? Huh?
I have an inspiration of unparalleled brilliance.
This little fellow could help us with our job.
What... that little splinter?
He couldn't lift a feather.
Ah, but you forget the old adage...
"there are more ways than one to crack a vault."
He can wiggle through the keyhole.
No, no.
I don't want nobody else.
I can open it with my bare hands.
Of course you can, of course you can, but he can do it quieter.
Watch me strike a bargain with the old man.
We'll play a little game.
The cards, of course, will be marked.
Oh, ho ho ho!
Ivan.
Our fortune is as good as made.
Stand back, my good man.
Oh! Ha ha ha!
Your gracious pardon, sir.
My colleague and I are showmen of prominence on our way to the annual fair, and we were wondering what price you put upon the little lad.
Price? What do you mean?
Do you want to buy him?
Oh, no, no, no.
It would be more of a loan... a sort of loan-lease.
We'd teach him a good trade, and we would pay you.
He will be learning, and you'll be earning.
He's not for sale!
He's my son!
Oh, we understand.
Don't we, Antony?
Oh, yes, we do.
Who would argue with a father's heart?
I like you.
So do I.
I like you very much.
Goodbye, little lad.
One day, your father will be very proud of you.
Arrivederci.
I don't like the looks of those fellows.
I thought they were kind of nice.
Ha ha ha!
Hey, where are you?
Come on.
Hello, Woody.
Queenie!
Where have you been?
I've been calling for you.
I've been looking for you all through the forest.
Oh, poor Woody.
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
I just secured the position as second woodwind in the royal military band.
I think that's wonderful.
Do you really?
Won't you sit down?
Thank you.
Ahh...
You know, queenie, if only there weren't this barrier between us... you being an immortal and I a mere unworthy mortal.
There needn't be a barrier, Woody.
You mean I can be immortal, too?
The other way around.
You can become a mortal.
Well, what's stopping you?
What do you have to do?
It isn't what
I have to do. It's you.
Me?
Uh-huh.
Well, tell me.
Can't you guess?
Well...
I have to be promoted to first woodwind in the royal military band?
No.
Not bandmaster.
It's much simpler than that.
Woody.
Yes?
Would you promise me something?
Anything in the world.
Well...
You won't ever, under any circumstances, ever...
Try to...
Kiss me, will you?
Oh, no!
Certainly not!
Funny how a fella can change, you know.
There was a time when
I wouldn't have thought twice about kissing a girl as pretty as you.
Oh, I was a terrible fella.
Were you, Woody?
I certainly was... kissing, kissing, always kissing girls, sometimes even when they weren't looking.
Ha ha ha!
Ah...
Ahem.
Of course, with you, it's different, you know.
Ever since I first met you,
I've been a changed man.
You know why?
Because you were right up there.
I was way down here.
I still am, but I won't always be.
One day, queenie,
I'll be worthy of you.
And until then...
I'll respect you.
Thank you, Woody.
That's nice.
Hello, Woody.
Good afternoon, Jonathan.
Meet my son tom.
Pleased to meet you, young man.
Goodbye now.
What's the hurry, Woody?
Why don't you come home and have supper with us?
You know Anna's always happy to see you.
Thanks, Jonathan. I wish
I could, but I can't.
I'm a very busy man now.
I have to get back to the village. I have a job.
You? Working?
Certainly.
So long. I'll see you at the fair on Sunday?
Oh, I don't think you will.
Anna and I... we're too old for things like that.
Oh, Jonathan, how can you let this fella miss seeing the fair?
Look, if you can't take him, let him go with me.
I'll show him a good time.
He'll be the guest of the second woodwind in the royal military band.
Ah!
Step up!
Step up!
Step up!
Step up!
¶ Step up, my friends, and see my shoes ¶
¶ I made them especially for you to use ¶
¶ and I can show you the smartest shoes ¶
¶ that you ever saw at a fair ¶
¶ step up, my friends, and see them shine ¶
¶ you never saw shoes that shine like mine ¶
¶ because I handle the talented line ¶
¶ exactly the kind you should wear ¶
¶ these shoes upon my shelf ¶
¶ are shoes I wear myself ¶
¶ these are talented shoes ¶
¶ talented shoes, talented shoes ¶
¶ they leap and jump and hop and skip ¶
¶ and every skip is full of zip ¶
¶ these are talented shoes ¶
¶ talented shoes, talented shoes ¶
I'll take these.
¶ A man is wise to choose ¶
I'll have a pair.
¶ Such talented, talented shoes ¶
I'll take these.
Right, right.
¶ Of 7-league boots ¶
¶ you may have heard ¶
¶ they fly through the air ¶
¶ like a hummingbird ¶
¶ well, I would never say a word ¶
¶ if mine weren't better than those... ¶ give us two of the dancingest pairs.
¶ ...boots set out to fly ¶
¶ they fly much faster ¶
¶ and twice as high ¶
¶ they're just the boots you ought to buy ¶
¶ if you want to be on your toes ¶
¶ these shoes upon my shelf ¶
¶ are shoes I wear myself ¶
¶ these are talented shoes ¶
¶ talented shoes, talented shoes ¶
¶ they leap and jump and hop and step ¶
¶ and every step is full of pep ¶
¶ these are talented shoes ¶
¶ talented shoes, talented shoes ¶
¶ a dunce cannot confuse ¶
¶ such talented, talented, talented ¶
¶ talented, talented, talented shoes ¶ hey, tom, what do you think of those dancing shoes?
Huh?
The dancing shoes.
Oh, I think they're wonderful.
I think so, too.
Let's get some.
But don't you have to stay here?
Oh, we'll be back before it's my turn to play.
They'll never miss me for a few minutes.
Hold on, tom.
Let's go.
I'm sorry, Woody.
All sold out.
Not even a pair for a queen?
Oh, very funny, Woody.
Ha ha ha! Very funny.
Well, how about a pair for this little fellow?
For tom? You know,
I believe I have.
See if these fit.
Ho ho!
Look at this.
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Woody, that no-good loafer... where is he?
Where is he?
Where's Woody?
I was crazy to give him a job in the first place.
Woody!
Woody, wherever you are...
You're fired!
Better go after him, Woody.
Those are talented shoes he's wearing.
They'll keep on dancing as long as the music plays.
Tell them to hold the music!
Stop the music!
Stop!
Bandmaster!
Bandmaster!
What now?
They say to play faster!
Faster? Gladly.
Bandmaster!
Bandmaster!
Stop!
Tom!
Have you seen tom?
No, I haven't.
Stop playing!
Have you seen tom?
No.
My balloon's gone!
Tom!
Hey, Woody!
Look at me!
Don't let go, tom!
Hang on!
It's no good, Ivan.
It won't give at all.
Now...
Finding ourselves in the situation in which you have placed us, it would seem a little coordination is necessary.
We'll use this piece of wood.
This time, our effort shall be unified.
Now, both together when I count 3.
You understand 3?
Yes. It comes after 2.
Good boy. Right.
Ooh...
Argh!
Oh...
Hey, Ivan.
Shh.
Now, we must approach this problem from a highly scientific angle.
Sure, but... but first, we must practice unadulterated silence.
Understand?
Hey! What are you doing?
It's the little runt!
Yes.
Yes, yes.
Thank you.
You saved my life.
Think nothing of it, young fellow.
Fate decreed I should be present in your hour of need, that is all.
Ivan, why can't we use him to get... why don't you shut up?
Oh...
Young fellow, talking about hour of need, it would seem you dropped in just when my companion and I could use your assistance in the performance of a good deed.
Oh, I'll be glad to help.
I knew it.
I knew it the first time
I laid eyes on him, see.
That's what I like about this charming young gentleman.
He's so cooperative.
Uh, what do I have to do?
Come over here.
Get the rope.
Now, Thomas, my boy, listen to me.
Let me explain.
Now, the mayor of this village is an absolute rascal, right?
Now, he has the money belonging to the poor orphans down there.
And he intends to keep it all for himself.
Now, if you'll go down this rope and help us to get the money out, we'll see that it is distributed amongst those to whom it rightfully belongs, eh?
I don't know. Maybe I should ask my father or Woody.
Oh, no! No, there's no necessity to bother them.
I'm sure they would approve.
In fact, I'm quite certain your father would be very proud of you.
Very proud.
Why, yes.
He would?
Yes, of course he would.
Come on. Let's pull the job...
I mean, let us do our best to help the poor little orphans.
Shall we?
You see, Antony?
Everything comes to him who waits.
He believed every word of that silly story. Ha ha!
Hey, wait a minute!
How do I know that money's really for the poor orphans?
Oh, uh...
Well, you have my word of honor.
And you have mine.
Oh! Oh, well, then it must be alright.
Whew.
What should I do now?
Shh.
Tie the rope to one of those bags.
Uh, which one?
The biggest one!
Shh.
Then climb on, and we'll pull you up.
It's going to work,
Tony. Ha ha!
Nobody will guess how we did it.
It's ready.
Right, right.
Ha ha ha!
Ahh! Ha ha ha!
Aren't we going to take any more?
Shh.
Not now. Maybe we'll come back later.
Well, there's plenty more down there.
Ivan.
Let's get rid of the kid now so he won't open his mouth.
Are you out of your mind?
Leave this to me.
Now, listen, my dear fellow.
We're going to take you for a nice little ride.
Ivan.
They are gone.
Come on.
Now, tom, this is where we must part.
Now, that's the road that takes you home.
Now, remember our little secret.
Don't tell anyone.
That's the only way we can surprise the dear little orphans.
Oh, by the way,
I'm sure the dear little orphans would like you to have this.
Run and get it!
Tooty dooty doo!
Tooty tooty too.
Bye!
Bye.
Goodbye.
Bye.
Help! Help!
And where have you been all day?
Oh, all over the place.
I had a wonderful time.
I got some talented shoes, and then I went dancing, and I rode on a balloon.
Oh, I've just been helping two friends do a good deed.
Until it got dark, and you fell into the swamp.
Ah, I'd have got out anyway, but thanks just the same.
What was that?
Hi, queenie.
Hello, Woody.
Do you realize I have searched every inch of this forest trying to find you?
Well, I'm sorry you got lost.
I got lost?
You got lost you mean.
I've been looking for you all day.
The trouble with you, tom... oh, Woody, why don't you leave him alone?
Never mind, queenie.
The trouble with you, tom, is you have no sense of responsibility.
Responsibility?
What about your sense of responsibility?
You were to keep your job and take care of tom.
He only went away to get you a pair of shoes.
You stay out of this!
Don't speak to him like that.
I think you'd better take him straight home.
Oh! "Do this, do that."
I've had enough!
I'm tired of dragging through this forest doing things for other people.
If it's not him flying around in balloons, it's you trying to get me to kiss you.
Woody! How dare you?
Ah, yes, don't think
I don't know.
I'm not as dumb as I may look.
I will kiss you when I'm good and ready to marry you and not before if you think I'd marry a no-good, idle do-nothing like you, you second woodwind, you! Oh!
Hey, wh-wh-what...
Don't go, queenie.
I'm... I'm sorry, Woody.
It was all my fault.
Oh, it's...
It's alright.
Well, come on, tom.
Let's get you home.
That good-for-nothing
Woody.
He'll have some tall explaining to do.
Your father's in a pretty bad mood.
Yes. You better go ahead.
I'll try to get to bed before father sees me.
You've had enough trouble of your own.
Thanks, tom.
So long.
Bye.
Disgraceful!
Disgraceful!
A boy of his age being out till this time of night.
It's been dark for hours.
I should never have let them go.
It's my fault.
Where are they?
Where are they?
I'll teach him a lesson.
I hope nothing's happened to him.
Something will happen to him when he gets home.
The idea of a youngster like that gallivanting around.
I'll see he doesn't do it again,
I can tell you that.
So...
You finally decided to come home.
Now, you tell me what you've been doing all this time, and it better be good.
Jonathan, you mustn't allow yourself to get upset like this.
We'll talk about it in the morning.
Say goodnight to your father.
Goodnight, father.
I'm sorry.
Trouble, yes?
I've just made my folks so unhappy, and I'm so sorry.
Being sorry next best thing to being good.
Humble one suggests you go sleep.
I can't sleep.
I just feel so bad
I can't sleep.
Problem easily remedied.
Let me introduce yawning man... very good friend.
¶ I'm ¶
¶ the yawning man ¶
¶ the yawning man ¶
¶ I come when shadows creep ¶
¶ with my yawning song ¶
¶ I stroll along ¶
¶ and help put people to sleep ¶
¶ If you just can't sleep ¶
¶ and you're tired as could be ¶
¶ there's a remedy ¶
¶ it's the yawning melody ¶
¶ if you yawn, yawn, yawn ¶
¶ then you'll sleep, sleep, sleep ¶
¶ till the dawn, dawn, dawn ¶
¶ so let's all yawn ¶
¶ If the sandman comes ¶
¶ and his sack he unties ¶
¶ tell him, "go away" ¶
¶ who wants sand thrown in his eyes? ¶
¶ if you yawn, yawn, yawn ¶
¶ then you'll sleep, sleep, sleep ¶
¶ till the dawn, dawn, dawn ¶

¶ If you still can't sleep ¶
¶ and for slumber you yearn ¶
¶ if your eyelids burn ¶
¶ and you squirm and twist and turn ¶
¶ try to yawn, yawn, yawn ¶
¶ then you'll sleep, sleep, sleep ¶
¶ till the dawn, dawn, dawn ¶
¶ so let's all yawn ¶
Jonathan, come and sit down.
You can't possibly go to work in weather like this.
You might just as well relax and enjoy your breakfast.
Where's tom?
He's asleep.
Wake him up.
Oh, no, let him sleep.
He's so exhausted.
I wonder who that is.
Well, gentlemen, what can I do for you?
Maybe you can help us.
The treasury has been robbed, and we're searching for the culprits.
Have you seen any strangers hereabouts?
No, I haven't.
Have you, Anna?
Why, no.
Have you looked in the forest?
Yes. We've been all through it.
We're about to have breakfast.
Won't you join us?
Come in, gentlemen.
Make yourselves at home.
Well, thank you.
Won't you sit down?
Here you are.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Very tasty, ma'am.
Well, thank you.
Ouch!
Wake up, con-fu-shon.
Hey, this is a coin from it.
There's no doubt about it, I swear.
How now, madam?
Are you in the habit of baking your bread in the village treasury?
I haven't the least idea how it could've got there.
This coin is part of the stolen money.
Where's the rest of it?
Honestly, I don't know.
I don't even know how this one got here.
Huh! A likely story.
You mean you don't believe her?
Are you accusing us of thievery?
And you call yourself honest Jonathan.
You may call yourself honest Jonathan, but as for me, you're a crook.
That isn't true!
He's the thief.
Don't you dare call my husband a thief!
You're both under arrest.
Hey, wake up, huh?
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up! Help!
Con-fu-shon!
Con-fu-shon, wake up!
Honorable yawning man has very powerful medicine.
We got to open the door!
Con-fu-shon, some soldiers just accused my money of stealing parents.
No, I mean, well, we got to open the door!
He's not a crook.
Are you awake?
A Jack-in-the-box.
Yes, yes, yes!
Come on.
Yes, a big mistake.
You haven't heard the last of this, my friend. Let me go!
Take your hands off me!
Take your hands off me!
Wake up, Jack.
Very quick, wake up.
I'm sleepy.
Go away.
But... but... but honorable tom need honorable
Jack-in-the-box very much.
Why didn't you say so in the first place?
What can I do?
Can you open the door?
Consider it done.
Done.
Little man, big trouble?
Oh, con-fu-shon...
What am I going to do?
To prove innocence, find guilty one.
I know who the robbers are.
With such knowledge, problem easily solved.
Yes. So all I have to do is find the robbers and have them put in jail.
That's what I'm going to do.

Oh!
Oh, hello, tom.
I was just, uh, singing to myself a little.
I heard.
Well, where are you going?
Well, I have to go catch a couple of criminals.
Really? And what have they done?
Well, they robbed the treasury.
My folks got blamed for it, and they took them to prison.
Oh, no. Well, that's terrible!
Of course it's terrible!
Are you going to come and help me or just sit there and sing?
Hmm? Oh, help, of course, tom.
Well, come on, then.
I know what they look like, too.
One of them has a big tall hat, and the other's a big fat man.
Wait a minute.
Are they dressed in black?
Yes, yes, and... it's them.
You know who they are, and I know where they are.
Come on, tom.

"Give me that money, do you hear?" Ha ha ha!
Go away.
14 for you, 14 for me.
I told him to go away.
Yes.
I heard you.
Now we start again.
Maybe we better leave and share the Booty later.
Hey, I want mine now.
Very well.
We must hurry.
One for you, one for me.
Woody, wake up.
Three for you, three for me.

Ah, cheers.
Hey, Ivan, you've got more than me.
But you saw me count.
Let's start again.
This time,
I will do the counting.
One for me, and one for you.
Two for me, and two for you.
Three for me, and three for you.
Four.
Alright, you do the counting.
One for you, and one for me.
Two for you, two for me.
Three for you...
Salud, Ivan, eh?
Bottoms up.
Ha ha ha!
Ivan, there's a crook in here, and it's not me.
There are two crooks in here, and they are both you.
Ah... Ha ha!
Ah, money!
There he is.
Oh, money! Ah!
Ha ha! Money. Money.
Oh!
Oh! Argh!
Oh!
Money, I love you!
Ah! En garde!
Touche. Touche.
Touche.
Three-che.
Touche.
Ow!
Ah ha ha!
Had enough?
I've not had enough.
Ow!
Ha ha ha!
Yah! Ha ha!
Aah!
Put 'em up.
Aah!
Aah!
So you try to cheat me, eh?
Now I show you how to count.
Ha ha ha!
Aah!
One for you, and one for me.
Two for you...
Two for me.
Ha ha ha!
Three for you, and three for me.
Ha ha ha!
1, 2, 3, 4 for you.
And 1, 2, 3, 4 for me. Ha ha!
Ivan, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 for you.
Ha ha ha!
Hey!
There's the kid!
Hey, there he is!
Psst.
Now I'm really going to fix you for coming here.
I'll fix you, boy.
Hear ye! Hear ye!
The decision of the royal court.
"For participation in the robbing
"of the village treasury,
12 lashes of the whip."
"For failure to divulge the names of your confederates, another 12 lashes of the whip."
Whipping's too good for them!
They stole our money!
Get on with the whipping! Please!
We didn't do it.
We're innocent!
Ha ha ha!
Huh? Oh.
Ow!
He bit me.
He bit me.
Where is he?
He's not there, Ivan.
There he is.
Wah!
Help! Help!
Ha ha! Now let's get the money, eh?
Ha ha ha!
Pleasant dreams.
Buena sera.
Well, I guess we got through with the little runt.
Yes, yes.
Come on. Let's go.
No, no, wait.
There's still some more.
Oh, leave those for the orphans.
Ha ha ha!
Come on.
¶ I am an orphan ¶
¶ I am an orphan ¶
¶ I am an orphan ¶ ha ha ha!
¶ I am an orphan ¶ ha ha ha!
Come on.
Tom?
Tom?
Before carrying out the sentence,
I am going to give you one last chance.
Where have you hidden the money?
I can only repeat, sir, we know nothing about it.
Tell the town lasher to prepare.
We've got the money.
We've got the money.
It's the wrong road! This will take us to the village.
The stupid beast won't obey.
Make way for the town lasher!
There's the turn.
Get off the road.
Turn to the right, you stubborn old nag!
To the right, Ivan.
To the right.
I know. I know!
I can't do anything with it.
That was fine.
To the right, Ivan.
To the right.
There's a crossroad coming.
Go straight ahead.
We'll show them who the real robbers are.
Faster! Faster!
I can't go any faster.
We made it! Stop!
There are the robbers!
They stole the money!
Hi, mom. Hi, dad.
Fetch those men!
Out of my way, donkey boy.
What have you done with him?
Where's tom?
I'm over here,
Woody!
Here I am.
No kisses, remember?
Oh, don't worry, mom.
She does that all the time.
Now, wait a minute.
This isn't the way it was supposed to happen.
Try it again...
Gently.
Like... Like this?
Yes.
Queenie, you're real.
