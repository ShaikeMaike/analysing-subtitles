Papa!
Papa!
What now, Hildy?
Look!
Gee whiz. Again.
What´s the matter, Gus?
Cigarette.
Ken riding her?
He was, but not now.
Hildy.
Whoa, whoa.
Doggone that kid.
Look at this.
I hope he´s all right.
Young´uns fall light.
He´s used to it.
He could get hurt.
Saddle Shorty.
I better go see.
Ja, Boss.
Never mind, Gus.
Ken.
Yes, sir?
Come here.
You all right?
Sure, I´m all right.
Cigarette toss you again?
Yes, sir.
You ""digged"" your heels in her.
I didn´t.
Did you, Son?
Yes, sir.
Ken, aren´t you ever going to grow up?
I´ve told you not to clap your heels into her.
Look at that bridle.
Second one you´ve broken this week.
I´m sorry, Dad.
Oh, you found the saddle blanket.
What saddle blanket?
I lost it yesterday afternoon.
You forgot to cinch the saddle properly.
Yes, sir.
Gee whiz, it´s all ""tored.""
Will you keep quiet?
It got caught on some barbed wire.
You´re the doggonest kid... for losing, busting, and forgetting.
Breakfast is all ready.
Where´s Ken?
He´s coming.
Cigarette tossed him again.
I don´t know what
I´ll do with that boy.
Doesn´t pay any attention to what I say.
Always losing equipment or breaking it somehow.
He´s still a child.
He´s old enough to have his wits about him.
He´s walking around with his head in the clouds.
It´s a wonder he doesn´t trip.
Morning, Mom.
Come on, darling.
Eat your oatmeal while it´s hot.
Good heavens.
What is it?
Ken´s report card.
I suppose you´re not surprised you haven´t been promoted.
No, sir.
Here, look at your marks.
Let him eat his breakfast first.
Just as a matter of curiosity... how do you go about getting a zero on an examination?
40 in history, 1 7 in arithmetic, but a zero?
Just as one man to another, what goes on in your head?
What have you got to say for yourself?
Nothing, sir.
What were the questions you missed... in that English exam?
We were to write a composition.
Couldn´t you think of anything?
I was going to write... about how you lost your polo mare... how the albino stole her from Banner.
Well, why didn´t you?
I got to thinking.
I thought we had time.
I thought the hour had just begun... when the school bell rang.
You never even got started.
Not a single word, Ken?
No.
Just daydreaming, huh?
No, I was thinking about--
About what?
About my colt.
You haven´t got a colt.
Dad, give me a colt, won´t you?
You´ll get one when you learn how to treat one.
You´ll have to buck up.
Trouble is, you don´t try.
I do try, Dad.
I´d like to see some proof.
Meantime, you´ll study an hour a day... to make up your work.
[Knock On Door]
Come in.
Good morning,
Missus.
Good morning, Gus.
What´s today, Boss?
Good day to move the horses.
It´s time they were off the meadows.
A storm´s cooking up.
Can I help?
Four older horses have to be in shape for the rodeo... and those three-year-olds have to be broke.
Can´t I help move them?
Great guns, no.
It´s tough enough to move 1 00 horses... all fresh as blazes after a winter out... without a kid along to make them nervous.
- I´ll be right out.
- Ja, Boss.
Want another cup of coffee, dear?
No, I had enough.
Got to get started.
Kenny, you can ride any horse on the ranch.
Why are you so set on having a colt?
It isn´t just riding.
I want a colt to be friends with me.
I want a colt of my own, all my own.
You better start your studying.
Get it over with.
Bye, Daddy.
Bye.
Ken, what are you doing?
I´m doing my arithmetic, Mom.
[Alarm Rings]
Where are we going?
To watch Dad bring in the horses.
We can take the shortcut.
No, you better stay here.
It´s tough enough bringing in 1 00 horses... all fresh after a winter out... without having a girl tagging along making them nervous.
Those horses ain´t scared of me.
Good morning.
Nice work, Banner.
Banner don´t let those mares get away with nothing.
Banner´s got everything it takes to make a great horse-- brains, heart, and courage.
If he´d just pass it on to all the colts.
What horses we´d have then.
Whoa now!
Whoa now!
Whoa there!
Look out, Gus.
They´re stampeding!
Gus, try to head them off.
Stop them, Banner!
They´re making straight for the rock slide.
Head them off, Banner.
[Whinny]
[Whinny]
[Whinny]
What are you doing here?
I--I came to see the horses.
I didn´t mean to do it.
I didn´t mean to scare them.
[Whinny]
Jeepers, if I could ever have a colt like that.
Are we on the downgrade?
I never had so many bills and less money to pay them.
We can´t sell our horses at a profit.
They´re good horses with good blood.
Mm-hmm, all but that albino strain.
They got a crazy streak in them.
No use trying to sell them.
I wouldn´t even get back the cost of raising them.
I´d rather shoot them.
I would, too, if they weren´t so doggone fast.
I hoped to get one decent colt out of that bunch.
Rob... give Ken a colt.
Huh?
I want you to give Ken a colt.
After that stunt he pulled this morning?
You know he didn´t mean to.
He doesn´t deserve a colt.
Won´t you ever give him one?
Sure. I´ve been expecting to.
If he pays attention to his studies--
Uh-uh.
No.
That´s another thing.
That isn´t going to get anzwhere.
Didn´t he study today?
He exposed himself to his books.
Good heavens. Nothing I say to him makes any impression.
He wants his own colt.
He can´t think of another thing.
But that´s all backwards.
You don´t bribe children to do their duty.
It´s not a bribe.
What would you call it?
I just have a feeling...
Ken isn´t going to pull anything off.
It´s time he did.
Maybe a little thing like this... would turn the trick.
That isn´t a little thing.
It isn´t easy to break and school a colt.
I won´t have a good horse spoiled by his carelessness.
Rob, it´s important.
He´s got to succeed at something.
What he needs is--
Is to snap out of it.
If you want to put it that way.
He needs to grow up.
How would having his own colt help?
Oh, you know.
Something of his own... responsibility.
He´d have something real that he cared about... more than those things he goes mooning about.
Don´t go.
I´d like to give Ken a colt.
I´d like to get closer to the boy somehow... but every time I get set for a get-together session... he hands me a facer like what he pulled today.
Rob, didn´t you ever want anything... more than anything else in the world?
Yes. You.
You do understand.
[Whinny]
[Whinny]
[Humming]
Where´s Ken?
Probably looking at the ducks on the landing.
For Pete´s sake, what ducks on what landing?
That old print of mine.
He likes to look at them.
Gus says Rocket broke away last night.
Thinks she´s got a colt somewhere.
We´ll have to look for her.
I´ll find her.
Good. I´ll go with you.
Son, I´m taking back yesterday´s order.
You can forget that hour of study.
Thanks, Dad.
And, Ken...
I´m going to give you a colt.
A colt?
A colt of my own?
Mm-hmm.
I´ll give it to you a week from today.
That´ll give you time to make your own choice.
I can have any colt on the ranch?
- Ayearling?
- That´s right.
Gosh.
Jeepers, maybe I can have the one I saw yesterday.
Come on, you old jughead.
Come on there.
Oh, come on. Come on.
Oh, step on my foot, would you?
Come on.
Why don´t you take Highboy for your colt?
That chump?
Don´t think I´m riding Cigarette because I want to.
It´s because
I have to.
Then how about Lassie?
She´s as fast as anything and black as ink.
Who said I wanted a black horse?
How about College Boy?
He´s smart like a fox.
I´m going to pick a filly.
I know the one
I want, too.
I hope I find her.
Hey, don´t do that again, Hildy.
Cigarette´s kind of nervous.
She might kick you.
She better don´t.
I´ll kick her back.
Thanks, Tim.
OK.
Ready, Ken?
Yes, sir.
Don´t see why
I can´t go, too.
You´re a girl.
That´s why.
Check your cinch?
Yes, sir.
Let´s go.
Ken, don´t you want your hat?
Oh, thanks, Mom.
Don´t see why
I can´t be a boy.
Even you´re a boy...
I guess.
Maybe you think it´s funny, giving you a colt... when you deserve a good hiding.
Flunking all your exams... then pulling that stunt yesterday.
Don´t think
I´m letting you off.
I´m not.
I haven´t gone soft.
Don´t get that into your head.
I expect as much now as I ever did.
This isn´t any reward... because you haven´t won any reward.
This is a partnership.
One of these days,
I´ll need your help.
You have to be trained so you can give it.
Every man needs training.
Discipline.
I got mine at West Point.
And how.
You´re going to train that colt.
I´ll help you with the first breaking... but you´ll train it, and it´ll train you.
Yes, sir.
You and your mother may have to care for this ranch... without me pretty soon.
Where will you be?
I may have to go back into the army.
You understand, don´t you?
Yes, sir.
You make a good pony out of that colt... and let it make a man out of you.
Yes, sir.
I rode all through here yesterday.
I didn´t leave any colts behind.
If Rocket had a colt, she wouldn´t leave it.
I saw a colt yesterday... that got separated from the bunch in the stampede-- a sorrel filly with a cream mane and tail.
Sounds like
Rocket´s yearling.
Rocket´s?
The filly sired by Banner last spring.
That´s what was wrong with Rocket-- she missed that little filly.
She´d very likely console herself with a yearling.
Should pick up a track around here someplace.
Hey, Boss!
A cat.
That´s a mountain lion, all right.
Ja. A big one.
Haven´t had one around here for a long time.
Good thing we got the brood mares out of here.
Maybe we better look around that cave.
Well, it got one of them.
It´s dark brown.
It´s Rocket´s, I guess.
Tim was right.
She had one.
Didn´t she know it was dead?
Yes and no.
Mares are funny about death.
They´ll leave a dead foal... then remember it and hunt for it.
Will the mountain lion get any other horses?
Not now, Kenny.
They´re all out on the range.
Can´t he get the horse and colts there?
Not where there´s no cover.
Their only chance is surprise.
If a horse is off by itself... a lion will jump on it, bite through the spine.
Quick kill.
[Whinny]
It´s Rocket.
And her filly.
What a pretty little flicka she is.
Flicka<
What does that mean?
Swedish for ::little girl.´´
Flicka. That´s what I´ll call her.
My colt.
Your colt?
Yes, sir.
That´s the one I want.
Rocket´s filly, Ken?
Yes, sir.
I hoped you´d make a wiser choice.
You know how I feel... about Rocket´s line of horses.
But she´s fast.
Rocket´s fast, too.
They´re my worst horses.
There´s not one among them with any real sense.
The mares are hellions, the stallions outlaws.
They´re untamable.
I´ll tame her.
Nobody´s ever been able to tame a one of them.
You want a horse that´ll be a friend?
Yes, sir.
You´ll never make a friend of her.
Look what they did to get back together.
No fence in the world will ever hold them.
You better change your mind.
No.
OK, Ken. I promised you could make your own choice.
But remember--
Rocket´s loco... and 1 0-to-1 the colt is, too.
But she may not be.
Banner´s her father.
All right.
We´ll bring her in tomorrow or the next day.
It´s silly to write horses´ names on things.
Horses can´t read.
People can read.
But Pop can´t.
Besides, you ain´t even got a horse yet.
What do you mean
I haven´t got a horse?
Well, it ain´t here.
Dad´s bringing her in today.
[Honk Honk]
[Honk Honk Honk]
That´s Mr. Sergent.
He´s got lots of race horses.
He´s got a fat belly, too.
Hey, Gus, is Rob around?
Ja.
He´s in the house.
Hi, Rob.
Hi, Charley.
How you been doing?
Good. You?
Swell.
Glad to see you.
Sit down.
Rob, I´m shipping a carload of horses to Los Angeles.
Maybe you´d like to go in on the deal... and share the shipping expenses.
Might do that.
There´s room in the car for four more horses.
Sounds pretty good.
You know, Pop says
Flicka´s loco... like her mother.
Don´t say that, Hildy.
Well, ain´t her fault.
She can´t help it if her mom´s crazy, can she?
Banner´s got sense.
She could be like her father, couldn´t she?
I don´t know.
When I do something dumb...
Mom says I take after the old man... and when I do something smart...
Pop says I sure don´t take after the old lady.
You haven´t got anything like Rocket.
That she-devil can outrun... any animal you´ve ever seen.
You´re crazy.
Like to make a bet?
Hello, Charley.
Well, hello there, Nell.
No. Don´t get up.
I only have a minute.
What are you two talking about?
Rocket.
If I could get a mare to do #5 miles an hour--
She´ll make you a fortune... if you could break her.
My broncobuster can break any horse.
He can do it if she´s worth breaking.
Worth it?
Didn´t I tell you?
How much do you want?
Dollars.
You got a stopwatch?
No. I got a speedometer.
Good enough.
Let´s go.
I´ll get lunch ready for you.
[Honking]
There they are.
Isn´t Flicka beautiful?
[Honk Honk]
She´s heading for the north range.
We´ll clock her there.
The ground´s flat.
[Honk Honk]
She´s like a locomotive.
Does she always run with her nose up?
Yeah. She´s a stargazer.
[Honk Honk]
[Honk Honk]
Look at the speedometer.
Faster, Boss.
She ain´t half trying.
[Honk Honk]
If she does #5,
I´ll buy her.
Jumping jeepers!
Well, what do you say?
It´s a deal... if she´s delivered sound in wind and limb.
Just how you´ll do that is anybody´s guess.
You leave that to me.
Look out for Rocket.
Get in there, get in there!
Tim, throw a rope on her.
[Whinny]
Won´t be easy to get her in.
Stay with her, Tim.
Come on!
Get that noose off her neck.
Be careful, Rob.
Think I´d deliver her with string hanging on her?
I put it on.
I´m going to get it off.
Look out!
Open that chute gate so she can see through.
Get in there.
Shut the gate.
Get the truck.
Whoa. That´s it.
Sergent expects her in good shape.
Try not to skin her up.
Get her out of here.
Well, that´s that.
You mean that´s $500.
It´ll come in mighty handy, won´t it?
Dad, look!
Oh, Rob.
That finished her.
Well?
She´s dead.
Poor old Rocket.
It´s too bad, but these things will happen.
Just takes little lick to kill horse.
There´s one thing
I can still do.
Hello, Williams?
This is McLaughlin.
OK. Thanks.
Look, Williams, I got a load of horses for you.
Yeah, those albinos.
Yep. Every one of them,
Rocket´s whole tribe.
There should be some good horseflesh among them.
All right, your own price.
Good.
Yep.
There are nine of them.
Wait a minute.
There may be 1 0.
Ken, come here.
Here´s a chance to do a sensible thing.
I want you to choose another colt... and let me sell Flicka to Mr. Williams.
I´m asking for your sake as well as mine.
What´s the use having another Rocket?
You saw what happened.
I´m going to tame Flicka.
That´s impossible.
Sometimes bad horses get tamed.
You don´t want a loco horse, do you?
I want Flicka.
Look at me.
Dad, please.
She´s mine.
Sorry to keep you waiting, Williams.
I thought there was one more.
No. There are only nine.
Right.
I´ll send them over.
So long.
Haw!
Haw!
Git!
Well, that´s that.
Sure is a wild one.
We´ll let her think it over.
She´ll go right through that wire.
She´ll never go over.
It turned her.
Dad, she has got sense.
Flicka!
I knew it, that crazy--
Rob, hurry!
Whoa, whoa!
Whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
There now.
Don´t think she´ll pull out of it.
Maybe it´s just as well.
Hadn´t been this way, it would´ve been another.
A loco horse isn´t worth the bullet... it takes to shoot it.
Now easy, girl.
Flicka.
Eat your dinner,
Kenny.
Do I have to, Mom?
You heard what your mother said.
Flicka, she´s--
Let him go to her.
He can´t do her any good.
Gus and Tim dressed her cuts.
She snaps out of it, she´s got water and oats.
Oh, Flicka, I didn´t mean to hurt you.
Get well.
Please be all right.
Gee, she was pretty.
What do you mean ::was´´?
She is.
She´s beautiful.
I meant when she was running back there.
Say, Ken.
Tomorrow, if you want to take care of her...
I´ll do your work for you.
Would you, Hildy?
Gee, that´d be keen.
Sure.
I´ll exercise Cigarette... bring in the wood, and dry the dishes.
You can stay with Flicka all the time... except when you´re sleeping.
Thanks, Hildy.
[Rooster Crows]
[Ring]
Gus, she´s going to be all right, isn´t she?
Pretty good chance... if we could get her to eat.
Maybe she don´t like oats.
I´ll get her some hay.
Whoa.
Don´t run away, Flicka.
Don´t be afraid of me.
I´m Ken.
This is hay.
You´ll like it.
Have some.
Take it easy.
She´s been scared pretty bad.
She´s eating.
She´s going to get well.
Ja.
It´s good sign.
Move her to the calf pasture.
There´s shade there and a running stream.
And she´ll be alone.
I thought horses like company.
Not her.
She´s a lone wolf.
She might jump out of the calf pasture and get away.
She won´t jump out.
She won´t jump anything for a long time.
[Whistling]
Ken. Breakfast.
Coming, Dad.
What´s he so chipper about this morning?
Flicka. She´s better.
Coming along, huh?
Mm-hmm.
She´s almost well.
The cuts are all healed up... and she´s eating like a horse.
Ooh.
Maybe we´re going to have a pleasant summer after all... if she doesn´t turn out to be another Rocket.
Oh, I hope not.
Ken, what kind of manners is that?
Sorry, Mom.
Morning, Dad.
Morning, Ken.
How were the ducks on the landing this morning?
What ducks on what landing?
Oh. Those.
Hardly noticed them.
Been so busy with Flicka.
Now that Flicka´s getting better... don´t forget you´ve got other duties.
Oh, yes, sir.
Give some time to your colt... but not all your time.
I won´t.
Will you come down... and look at Flicka this morning... see how she is?
Will Her Highness let you get near her?
Well, not too close.
She´s still a little scared.
But she´ll let you look at her... from the other side of the fence.
That´s big of her.
After breakfast, I´ll take a look.
Oh, swell.
Ooh!
Kenny.
Good morning, Flicka.
Flicka, Dad´s coming to look at you.
Be a good girl and don´t run away.
Well, she does look good.
Her cuts are all healed up... except for the one on the right front leg.
It´s almost well.
She´s beautiful.
Dad?
Do you think she´s... loco?
I´d have sworn it by the way she´s behaved... ever since she was born.
In fact, we´ve never seen her... except when she´s looked terrified.
Every horse looks wild in the eye... when it´s terrified.
She tried jumping that fence.
Anyone can try the impossible once.
There´s the old saying--
::It couldn´t be done... but the darn fool did it anzway.´´
Horses have jumped over 6 feet.
Maybe Flicka thought she could do it.
We´ll forgive her that one.
Point is, will she learn?
Can she learn?
Rocket couldn´t.
Or wouldn´t.
Dad, maybe I´ll never get her trained.
Heavens, Son, what have I been telling you... all these weeks?
Didn´t you understand?
What did you think loco meant?
Sort of goofy or wild-- hard to handle.
Oh, no, Son.
Much more serious than that.
There´s inherited insanity among animals... just as there is among humans.
Bad blood carries on... and albino blood isn´t safe for any filly to have.
But you said... maybe it´s just because she´s been scared.
She´s got a very intelligent face.
Much better than Rocket´s.
Fine, delicate mouth.
And such lovely eyes.
Mm-hmm.
Set far apart.
We´ll have to see how she responds to training.
How can I train her?
All you can do is try and win her confidence.
You know, Son, if you take everything away... from a living creature-- freedom, friends, its home, habits... happiness-- it´ll turn in sheer need and desperation... to the one thing that´s left.
In this case, that´s you.
Me?
Yes. You´re her whole life now.
Make her to like it.
Oh, I will, Dad.
I will.
Give her love and companionship.
Talk to her.
Will she understand me?
Of course.
A horse can tell you a lot of things, too... if you watch and expect it to be sensible and intelligent.
Pay attention to all the little signs.
The way it moves its body.
The ears. The eyes.
The whinnies.
That´s its way of talking, Ken.
That´s right.
There´s a neigh of terror.
A scream of rage.
A whinny of nervous impatience.
[Flicka Snorts]
The nicker of longing or hunger... or friendliness.
You learn its language, and it´ll learn yours.
And never forget-- horses understand everything you say to them.
Everything, Dad?
Everything.
[Flicka Snorts]
You mean... if they´re not loco.
[Whinny]
[Whinny]
[Whinny]
All right, all right... you´re hungry for your oats... but I´m hurrying as fast as I can.
There.
There you are.
Come and get it.
Good, isn´t it?
You do understand me, don´t you, Flicka?
Eat it all so you´ll be big and strong like Banner.
You´ve got a very smart father, Flicka.
You´ve got to forget all your wild ways... and be just like him.
Who are you talking to?
Flicka.
Aw, horses can´t understand people´s talk.
That´s all you know.
Flicka understands everything I say.
What´s more, she talks back to me.
Aw, poo.
Maybe you don´t know it... but horses got a language all their own.
There´s a neigh of terror... a scream of rage... a whinny of nervous impatience... a nicker of longing--
Eee-h-h-h!
There´s a nicker of hunger.
R-r-r-r.
Can you wiggle your ears?
Oh...
[Whinny]
What´s she saying now?
Oh, she´s telling me she´s finished her oats.
Oh.
Maybe she´s saying thank you, too.
Maybe she wants more oats.
[Whinny]
Maybe she´s had too many.
Maybe she´s got a pain in her stomach.
Maybe she needs some castor oil.
Only gluttons need castor oil.
[Whinny]
[Whinny]
She wants something.
Oh, I know.
She´s thirsty.
Why don´t you go and get a drink?
There´s a whole lake full of water.
Oh, all right.
Boy, you sure are getting spoiled.
Oh, gosh. I forgot.
Your Pop´s back.
For Pete´s sake.
Why didn´t you tell me?
I´ve got to see him right away!
[Whinny]
You hear that?
That means she doesn´t want me to go.
Aw, I betcha it just means... she´s got gas on her stomach.
[Whinny]
Bet you I didn´t forget anything this time.
Flour, salt, ham--
What about my hairpins?
How could I forget anything as important as hairpins?
They´re in there.
Dad!
Dad, did you get it?
Get what?
You know.
Sorry. I forgot all about it.
You did get it, didn´t you?
Sure, I did.
It´s a beauty.
Where is it?
Well,just a minute, Son.
Your work done?
Yes, sir.
Did you exercise
Cigarette?
Yes, sir.
She´s in her own pasture... and I tied the gate.
Good. Is she hot?
No, sir. I cooled her off on the way home.
Give her a good workout?
Yes, sir, and I didn´t lose or break anything.
Good work, Son.
You´re really coming along.
Can I have it now?
It´s in the front seat.
You were right, Nell.
The filly sure did the trick.
He´s a changed boy.
Flicka!
Flicka, I´ve got something for you!
Look. Brand-new saddle blanket.
Tailor-made especially for you.
Isn´t it keen?
When you grow up, we´ll put it on you.
Won´t even know you´ve got a saddle on your back.
We´ll go riding on the range... fly like the wind.
Look.
Got your name on it.
Oh, Flicka, I didn´t mean to scare you.
Honest, I didn´t.
Come back, Flicka.
Oh, please come back.
You don´t have to have it.
I won´t ever ride you... or put a saddle on you... if you don´t want me to.
You´ll just be my friend.
[Whinny]
Mom... did you ever want anything terribly?
Most everyone wants something, dear.
But you´ve grown up.
You´re married.
You´ve got Dad and me.
Why, you´re finished.
Then I shouldn´t still be wanting, should I... if I´m finished?
But people do, Ken.
Everyone?
Always, Mom?
Don´t you ever really get finished?
Yeah, I wonder.
Maybe sometimes, for a minute or two.
What is it you want now, Ken?
I do so want Flicka to be all right and not loco.
Oh, perhaps she isn´t loco, dear.
We don´t know yet for sure... but if she is, Ken... wanting won´t change it.
If she is, it´ll look bad for her, won´t it?
Let´s see what happens when we try to halter-break her.
Does she have to be?
We´ve got to find out, don´t we?
I suppose so.
As soon as she´ll let you touch her... we´ll have a try at it.
What if she won´t let us?
She loves you, doesn´t she?
Oh, yes.
I´m sure she does.
Well, that shows she´s intelligent.
How does it, Mom?
It´s just a way of putting away fear.
Don´t you understand,
Ken... that if you find love... if a person or an animal finds love... it´s the same as finding safety.
It´s comfort and friendliness and help.
Everyone longs for it.
And if Flicka´s found it... and yet doesn´t have sense enough... to know she´s found it... and goes around being crazy and silly with fear, then--
Then she´d be loco.
[Humming]
Good morning.
Where´d you catch them?
At that deep hole under the falls.
Put them in here.
Thank you.
Well, Boss, what today?
Look over the mowing machines.
We have to get at the haying soon.
Those stackers need repairs.
Oh, Gus.
Before we begin...
I want to help Ken halter-break his filly.
I want you and Tim to be on hand.
Where, Boss?
The calf pasture, and we´ll do it right now.
But, Dad, maybe... maybe we better wait a little while.
She´ll let you close to her now, won´t she?
Oh, yes.
Flicka´s my friend now.
She likes me, but--
Good. I´m glad to hear that.
It´s a fine thing to have a horse for a friend.
Flicka´s never had a rope around her neck.
She may fight us putting one on her now.
Maybe she´ll act like she did when she arrived.
Maybe she´ll act like Rocket.
She has to be halter-broken sometime.
Might as well get it over with.
Get ready.
I´ll be right down.
Didn´t you find a broken mule shoe last night?
Yes.
That´s good luck, ain´t it?
Yes, but if I make a mistake...
Dad may blame it on Flicka.
And then he wouldn´t--
Call her, Ken.
Flicka!
Have your loop ready, Tim.
[Whistles]
Put your bandanna around her neck.
Tie it in a loose knot.
Easy, Flicka. Easy.
Now take your belt off.
Slip it through the bandanna.
Now take ahold of the belt and lead her around.
All right.
Now bring her back.
Let go of the loop.
Hold your hand under her chin.
That´s it.
I´d call that halter-broken.
But it isn´t a halter, Dad.
You really take some convincing, young man.
All right. Give us the halter, Gus.
There you are.
Put it on her.
Go ahead, Son.
But how, Dad?
Just the way you put it on Cigarette.
All right, now lead her around again.
How did she get halter-broke, Dad?
That´s the way we break horses... on the Goose Bar ranch.
You figure it out, Ken.
Come on, boys.
Let´s get at those machines.
Then she´s not loco.
She´s not loco.
You could have knocked me down with a feather.
I knew she liked me pretty well, but gosh... she let me halter-break her... without even an argument.
Flicka´s a smart filly, just like her father.
All girls are smart like their pops.
[Whinny]
She´s calling me.
She sure is, Kenny.
That´s the nicker of friendliness.
Bet you she´s just hungry.
Gus, something´s happened to her!
She´s limping.
Something´s wrong with her front leg.
Flicka, what´s the matter?
What´s happened to you?
It´s that barbed-wire cut.
But that was all healed up.
But it didn´t heal right.
The leg´s swollen.
Is that bad?
Means infection.
Infection? That´s dangerous, isn´t it?
You betcha.
Hildy, you talk too much.
I think it hurts her.
She ain´t bearing any weight on it.
What do you do for a horse infection?
Just the same like for people-- put on poultice so it´ll drain.
I´ll get Mom to make a poultice.
Ja, I think you better.
She has got sense, hasn´t she, Mom?
She knows we´re helping her, doesn´t she?
Of course she does.
She´s a good little girl... and we´ll get her out of this in no time.
Slack off!.
Rip it!
Dad, I´d like to talk to you.
What about?
About Flicka.
For the love of Mike, can´t you see I´m busy?
Can´t be worrying about that filly.
I´m sorry, Dad.
Just a minute, Ken.
What is it, Son?
Flicka worse?
Dad, she´s so sick.
Will you come down and see her?
Maybe you can do something to help her.
All right. I´ll come have a look at her.
She´s lying down again.
Good heavens.
What´s happened to her?
She´s been getting awfully thin.
Thin!
I´m afraid she ain´t going to pull out of it.
Pull out of it?
She´s dead already.
How long´s she been like this?
She´s been real sick the last few days.
It´s the fever.
It´s burning her up.
She´s going to die.
We´ll have to put her out of her misery.
Oh, no, Dad.
I´m sorry, Ken.
It isn´t fair to an animal... to let it suffer like this.
Pick a time when
Ken isn´t around.
Gus!
Gus, when are you going to do it?
I was--I was going down soon now, Kenny.
Don´t do it tonight.
Wait till morning.
Just one more night.
Gus.
Well, in the morning, then.
It´s got to be done.
Your father gave the orders.
I know. I won´t say anything more.
[Dog Barks]
Shhh.
I´m coming, Flicka.
I´m coming.
Flicka?
Flicka, where are you?
Oh, my little Flicka.
Give him one of these every hour.
I´ll call to see him tomorrow morning.
He´s a very sick boy.
It isn´t only the cold and fever--
He had a shock,
Dr. Scott.
Something happened--
He´s been sad about a horse I gave him.
It´s been sick.
Oh, I see.
Well, you´d better have this prescription filled right away.
I´ll follow you into town... and bring it right back.
Don´t worry.
How is the little boy,
Missus?
Gus, he´s so sick.
Poor little boy.
[Thunder]
Gus, is Flicka dead?
No. Tim and me fixed her up in a blanket sling.
She can´t stand alone... but she drank a bucket of water.
Did Rob say you didn´t have to shoot her?
No, but I couldn´t do it.
When I found them like that this morning, I--
I know what you mean.
She´s got plenty of strength.
Sometimes I think, Gus, miracles can still happen.
It was the water washing the fever out of her... but it was Ken giving her courage.
All night that little fella sitting by her... saying, ::Hold on, Flicka.
::I´m here with you.
The two of us together.´´
I´ll tell Ken.
Maybe it will help him get well... knowing she´s still alive.
There´s a storm coming up, Missus.
I´ll stay here if you need me.
Thank you, Gus.
[Thunder]
I thought you´d never get here.
How is he?
Better. He´s been resting.
Good. We need some hot water.
Did you do as I told you?
Boss, I couldn´t.
I gave the order, and you´ve had plenty of time.
I just couldn´t do it.
Where´s the rifle?
In the bunkhouse.
Go get it.
Oh, Rob, please don´t.
He knows she´s alive.
He thinks she´ll get well.
Give him something to hope for.
[Thunder]
Would have been better if she were shot weeks ago.
It´s been nothing but misery for everyone.
Look what it´s done to Ken.
I wish you wouldn´t, Rob.
He needn´t know.
He´ll hear the shot.
He´ll think it´s thunder.
He´ll know it´s the rifle.
I´m sorry, but... it´s just no good letting sick animals live.
It´s raining.
The rain won´t hurt her, darling.
Flicka´s been out in thunderstorms all her life.
That was Dad´s car, wasn´t it, Mom?
Yes, dear.
[Whinny]
[Growl]
Please, darling.
It was only the thunder.
[Whinny]
Don´t worry about the cat.
I´m staying with you for the night.
Feel a lot better if I had a drink... and some dry clothes.
I´m a drowned rat... but so are you.
Rob!
Oh, Rob.
Yeah?
You all right?
Sure.
Ken´s asleep.
Gus is with him.
I got worried about you.
[Whinny]
But I thought--
I heard a shot.
It was a mountain lion.
Did you get him?
I will before morning.
I couldn´t do it.
She wants to die, she´ll have to do it by herself.
Ken heard the shot.
How´d he take it?
Well, he took it.
He didn´t question it, he didn´t seem to rebel.
If he wakes up and asks... don´t tell him she´s still alive.
But, Rob--
She may be dead by morning.
Wouldn´t surprise me.
He´s accepted her death.
If he knows she´s still alive, he´ll be all upset again.
I won´t tell him.
[Nickers]
[Whinny]
Thanks, Flicka.
[Whinny]
Morning, Dad.
How do you feel this morning?
Much better, thanks.
Enough better to go out in the warm sunshine?
I guess so.
It´s doctor´s orders.
Come on. I´ll help you get dressed.
Dad...where are we going?
The calf pasture.
That´s right, Son.
[Whinny]
Flicka.
It is Flicka.
But I thought--
I didn´t shoot her.
I couldn´t.
That shot you heard?
That was the mountain lion.
I killed him.
Ohh.
Ohh.
Easy, Ken.
[Whinny]
Flicka.
[Whinny]
Oh, Flicka.
She did get gentle, didn´t she, Dad?
Gentle as a kitten.
She´s given us a lot of trouble, Son... but she´s taught us some important things, too.
You, responsibility.
Me, there is such a thing as hope beyond hope.
That sometimes, when things are at their lowest ebb... all we need do is have a little more love... a little more patience, and a little more faith.

The princess -
Have you got news for me?
No, Master.
- Dead?
- She still sleeps.
- You followed my orders?
- Yes, Master.
- And the blind man?
- He has been found.
Hmm.
Alms, for the love of Allah.
Alms, for the love of Allah.
Alms, for the love of Allah.
Alms, for the love of Allah.
What? Your cur would bark?
Afine reward for charity.
If charity be false as that coin.
Then you cheat, son of a burnt father.
A blind man cannot tell truth from false.
Alas, I cannot tell day from night.
It was my dog.
- How can a dog tell bad from good?
- See for yourself.
Now, by the wonder of Allah -
It is a false coin, and I, myself, knew it not!
Come, O frequenter of tree trunks... now which is the bad one?
This is no dog, but the reincarnation of a tax collector!
O ye whom Allah gave
the gift of sight... to fill your eyes with beauty and delight... spare me a thought to whom your wondrous world... is but a city of eternal night.
Alms, for the love of Allah.
Alms, for the love of Allah.
- Bring him to me.
- Alms, for the love of Allah.
Alms, for the love of Allah.
Pray for me.
My name is Halima.
- I do not know you?
- Does one always know one's friends?
I have none to know.
Can you not trust in one
who brings not words, but deeds♪
In my house, there is food and rest.
And what is mine is yours.
- Why should you offer this?
- For your prayers.
That is much for little.
- Take my hand.
- There's no need. My dog sees for me.
He gives me more than ever he can receive, like all dogs.
This is a sleep beyond my knowledge.
Only this I know: When the blind man comes to her, she will be cured.
Strange, Master, he can do something all your powers cannot.
I'll make him do it for me and cast him away.
But she loves the blind man.
Do you call the lisping of two children in a garden love?
Love she has yet to learn.
And I am here to teach her.
- Poor blind beggar.
- Even more unfortunate than you know.
- That cannot be.
- But we are unveiled.
And I am... veiled.
- Tell us your name.
- Ahmad.
- Ahmad!
- Ahmad, you'll beg no more.
- Nor journey on.
- Stay here with us.
O sovereigns of silkiness,
I am sure you are beautiful... but for me there is no staying.
I must on, seeking the one I love, whom I have lost.
Men with two eyes often seek all their lives and fail to find that one.
Stay. There are great doctors here.
They may restore your sight.
That would be the blackest day of all my days.
- You talk in riddles.
- I will give you the answer. Listen.
There was once a king, son of a king and of a hundred kings.
His subjects countless, his wealth untellable... his power absolute.
And this dog was not a dog... but a youth who lived in Bagdad and became dear to the king.
But in those days,
he was nothing but a little thief.
Why do you smell my fish, master of a copper coin? Be off! Be off!
Shall I call the khadi's clubmen? Eh?
Stop, thief!
Stop, thief! Stop that thief!
Ahmad the king.
Son of Akbar, grandson of Haroun-el-Rachid... the great, the illustrious... lord of the earth, defender of the faith... servant of the all-highest... but master of all men.
Ahmad the king!
Ahmad the king.
Alas, I was that mighty man.
365 wives were mine.
In my heart there was no love.
Fifty palaces, and I had no home.
Richest among my subjects,
I was the poorest of the poor.
Every desire satisfied,
I grew empty of desire.
And in my whole vast kingdom,
I could find nothing to do - no task, no aim, no purpose - for always my grand vizierJaffar stood between me and my people.
Another execution.
Why had he to die?
He had been thinking, my lord and master.
- Is it a crime then to think?
- In a subject, it's quite unpardonable.
Are men only to be ruled by fear?
Men are evil - hatred behind their eyes, lies on their lips, betrayal in their hearts.
You will learn one day, great king... that there are about three things that men respect: the lash that descends, the yoke that breaks and the sword that slays.
By the power and terror of these, you may conquer the earth.
Do I want to conquer the earth?
What do you want, my lord and master?
I thought I might try to give them happiness.
Happiness. They are fools and knaves.
Your grandsire knew it, and if you would know it too... do as he did.
One night, when darkness falls... leave your palace, go among your people... mix with the crowds, go into their houses... listen, observe and remember.
- Tonight, Jaffar.
- Tonight, my king.
- Your people, my king.
- I've never been so close to them.
Go. Listen, observe and remember.
It is told, though Allah be wiser or more merciful...
there was in the past of the ages
a king among kings...
a master of arms and of armies,
of vessels and auxiliaries.
And this master of time and people
was an oppressor to both...
and the earth was as pitch in the faces
ofhis subjects and his slaves.
- What's he saying?
- And they groaned together in secret.
Why, I don't know.
Is it the king he's talking about?
Don't ask questions.
There are spies everywhere.
You must be careful in Bagdad.
I'm a stranger here. Surely you can tell me what the old man's talking about.
Oh, about foolish hopes... about a prophecy, about a liberator.
Only fools and children believe it.
A liberator indeed.
Not while Ahmad is king.
And they groaned together in secret and were slain in the marketplace.
But a wise man among the sages of Bagdad
comforted them with a prophecy...
saying, "In the fullness of years,
a liberator shall come upon you...
"and this shall be the sign ofhim:
he shall be the lowest of the low...
and you shall look for him
in the clouds."
And the people cried,
"We shall look for him in the clouds indeed...
"for if the great are powerless
to save us from this tyrant...
how can one of no account avail?"
And the reader
of the Milky Way replied...
"Have faith, trust in Allah...
"for there, one day in the blue,
you shall see a boy...
"the lowest of the low, mounted upon a cloud.
"But the cloud shall be as strong as the hills beneath the snow...
"and from the ranges of the sky...
he shall destroy this tyrant
with the arrow ofjustice."
- What is the name of the tyrant?
- Ahmad.
- Ahmad.
- Ahmad.
I wish the miracle would happen today.
I wish he would die today.
Arrest him. Put him in prison.
When he says he's the king, tell them he's a madman.
His friends and all who might be loyal to him must be destroyed.
I learned that night not that men are evil, but that he was evil.
When he persuaded me among my people,
he laid a trap for me.
I was thrown into prison...
and there, in prison,
my life began... for there I met the one who was to become my only true friend -
Abu, the little thief of Bagdad.
For only very little thieves are thrown into prison.
No! No! Not in prison!
No! No! Not in prison!
- Don't put me in prison! No!
- Come in, thief.
Cut off his right arm, and then his left.
Then his left leg, then his right.
- And then his head.
- No! No! No! No!
I say no! No! Please, no!
Don't kill me!
- I don't want to die!
- Tomorrow morning.
And as for the madman, our great sultan Jaffar is merciful.
Only his head.
As the sun rises.
No! No, no!
- No! No, no!
Poor boy, they've driven you mad.
Me mad?
Theyjust said you were mad.
Are you really mad?
That's it. I'm mad. I must be mad.
The maddest of all the madmen that ever lived in the sultan's palace.
- You are mad, quite mad.
- What's it matter♪
In the morning, unless the sun stops still and never rises, we both die -
the thief and the madman-
and I don't want to die.
You are not mad... and maybe we shall watch the sun rise from over the river.
Didn't you hear the jailer?
"As the sun rises."
As the sun rises, we'll take a boat and go down to the sea.
I've never seen the sea... but I've heard the sailors on the riverside talk about it.
In the sea are fishes as big as the great temple... and little ones as tiny as my little finger, with wings.
And boats as big as Bagdad itself... with sails as big as clouds.
And when the wind blows, they go as fast as antelopes... and carry you to the isles of India and China.
To the isles of India and China.
And we're locked in prison.
The ax will fall as the sun rises.
And you say you're not mad.
- Look!
- What's that?
The key of the prison.
I just stole it.
- The key? Give it to me!
- Steady, steady.
You want someone to look after you.
We can't go now.
- Why not?
- We must wait. In an hour they will eat.
After they eat, they sleep.
Then we go.
Hurry! Catch this oar.
Give me that rope!
Hurry! We must get away.
Do you want us to be killed?
Do you think they will have mercy on us?
Don't you think if the king knew, he'd be merciful?
The king was a fool. I hope he suffers as much as he made the people suffer.
- Do you hate him so much?
- Everybody hated him.
Oh, if I could only lay my hands on him just once... if I could only tell him what a fool he was.
Tell it now.
I am Ahmad the king.
- Speak.
- Ahmad the king is dead.
He died yesterday.
There's a new king, Jaffar.
- Look!
Jaffar would not make all that fuss over me.
He would not send the whole guard after me.
Mercy, Master. I'm your slave.
Leave me at least one arm for small stealing, and I'll pay you twice as much in taxes.
- What's your name?
- I'm Abu the thief... son of Abu the thief, grandson of Abu the thief.
Most unfortunate of 10 sons
with a hunger that yawns day and night.
Get up, my little friend.
- We must return to Bagdad.
- How can you be such a fool?
I mean, my king would be killed.
A dead king and a dead thief cannot do much, you know.
If your fingers are as nimble as your brain, you are indeed the prince of thieves.
Come on. Let's catch the morning breeze.
That will carry us to freedom.
Freedom. Strange.
I've had everything but freedom.
And I've had nothing but freedom.
And now we've got it, what shall we do with it?
Anything we like.
In three days, we shall be in Basra.
Here. Take this pole. Push!

Pancakes!
- Give me one!
- Really, you are a fool.
Whoever heard of eating pancakes without honey?
But how can you steal honey?
Allah give us the pancakes, and he will provide honey.
- Honey! Honey!
- Ah.
Honey! Honey!
- You buy honey?
- Yes, we are thinking of buying some.
- Uh, a jar, of course.
- Jar?
- Uh, if it's good honey.
- The best in Basra.
Uh, easy to say. First I must try.
Ahh. I've tasted better.
What do you think?
- No. No, not good enough.
- No.
- Your bees are out ofhumor.
- Take better care of them.
Hey, old friend.
Whose palace is this?
Why, the palace of the sultan, children of ignorance.
- The palace of a thousand toys.
- Toys?
Where have you come from, you beggars of no importance?
Don't you know that the sultan has the greatest collection of toys in the world?
Why toys?
The sultan is an old man, and old men are like children.
He guards his toys more jealously... than he guards his daughter.
But I say no more. Now out of my way, you masters of a thousand fleas.
Allah be with you, but I doubt it.
- What's happening?
- Let me go!
- Not until you've told us.
- The princess comes!
- Then why does everybody go?
- It's death to look on her.
- Death?
- Why?
No man has ever seen her, nor shall, till her father gives her in marriage.
- Is she so ugly?
- Her beauty is like the sun and the moon.
Let me go!
- Let us go!
- Where?
Up there!
Ah.
- Your eating will cause our death.
- Without eating, we die.
Abu! Here they come!
- I must see her again.
- But I've found Sinbad the sailor.
And he has given us two places on his ship.
It is more wonderful than I'd ever imagined.
And on the next tide, she sails.
I can't go.
I must see her again.
But, Ahmad, all my life I dreamt of going in a great ship across the world.
I can't go.
I must see her again.
If I help you to see her, will you then come with me?
I will.

To the pool.
Oh!
A djinni!
A djinni!
A djinni. Don't go! Don't go.
It's a djinni in the pool.
A djinni.
Are you afraid?
Yes. Terribly.
Why don't you run away♪
I want to look.
I've never seen a djinni before.
Well, then what do you see?
Remember always, to a djinni,
you must tell the truth.
You don't look wicked.
Are you a good djinni?
Not too good. Very good djinni are just as tiresome as very good men.
- Do you live down there?
- No.
- Why have you come?
- To see you.
- I was about to bathe.
- I'm waiting.
Bathe, with you there?
Give me your hand then.
Down into the water.
Oh, djinni, you've gone.
I didn't mean you to go so soon.
Shall I never see you again?
Never?
Don't be afraid.
I'm not a djinni.
Who are you?
Your slave.
Where have you come from?
From the other side of time... to find you.
How long have you been searching?
Since time began.
Now that you've found me, how long will you stay?
Till the end of time.
For me, there can be no more beauty in the world but yours.
For me, there can be no more pleasure in the world... than to please you.
Will you be here in the garden tomorrow at the same hour?
There's a gardener here who watches night and day.
His name is Death.
You mustn't come.
Forbid me then.
I cannot forbid.
Tomorrow!
And all tomorrows.
- Did you see her?
- I did.
Good! Then we can go with Sinbad tonight.
- No, Abu. I can't go.
- Why not? You have seen her again.
That's why I can't go - because I have seen her.
All right.
Then I'll go alone.
If you go there tomorrow again... how will you pass the guards without me to help?
- Oh, I'll find a way.
- You'll be caught.
You'll stay with me?
Oh, Abu, why should you?
You have as great a longing in your soul as I have.
- Why should you stay with me?
- Because I'm as great a fool as you are.
Brother of lions.
Fountain of hospitality.
You know, I have the largest collection of these mechanical devices... in the whole wide world.
And this is the most remarkable of them all.
I-It tells the time.
See how it works? Huh?
Sheer magic, isn't it?
I hope this dangerous device will never be allowed into the hands of the people.
- Dangerous?
- Yes.
If people once begin to know the time... they will no longer call you the king of time.
They will want to know how time is spent.
Oh, you're right.
Oh, the people must never know.
Look, look. Come.
Ah! See.
Such workmanship.
Such - Such precision.
Such reliability.
I do so prefer these things to my subjects.
Watch. Watch.
See. No, no.
That's the finest of them all.
See?
- I have only to wind a key or press a spring - and they do exactly the same thing every time... and exactly what I want.
And so often my subjects fail to do exactly what I want... and then I have to have their heads cut off.
See? Oh!
Your collection is indeed magnificent... and so near completion too.
Near completion? Huh.
I'd have you know my collection is-is the most complete completion.
Please, do not misunderstand me.
I am well aware that nothing short of a miracle could add luster... to this already dazzling display.
But such a miracle does exist.
A mechanical toy better than - than any of mine?
Knowing of your interest in these matters,
I have brought it with me.
Well, let's see it. Let's see it.
Quickly, quickly!
Oh, I can't bear to be kept waiting.
Ooh. This is exciting, this.
If Your Highness would wind it yourself.
Uh -
Oh! What's it going to do? Hmm?
Move its legs, or arch its neck?
Or- Or wag its tail? Hmm?
It doesn't kick, does it?
To tell you the truth, I'm always rather nervous of these things...
Till I know what they're going to do,
Till I get used to them.
Ooh. Ah.
It wants some winding.
- If Your Highness would mount.
- Yes.
- And now?
- Pull the reins!
Marvelous!
I am no longer a man. I am a bird!
I'm the king of birds!
Oh.
No! Oh. Mmm, I want it!
I want it. I must have it, and I'll give you anything you wish for it.
It's yours.
I ask but one thing in return.
Anything you will.
- Your daughter.
- My daughter♪
Mm-hmm.
Oh, dear, dear, dear. Really.
This is -This is very awkward.
Wh -What do you want my daughter for?
- I have to found a dynasty.
- Oh, quite, quite, quite.
I understand entirely about founding a dynasty.
Delightful thing to do.
I've tried myself, many times.
And what have I got?
A daughter.
The true offspring of the mother of miseries.
Her eyes have quarreled.
They're always trying to get at one another.
Her eyes are Babylonian eyes... and her eyebrows like the crescent moon of Ramadan.
- Her body's straight as the letter alif.
- How do you know?
- I've seen her.
- Oh, no, you -
- I have.
- Where?
- In my crystal.
- Oh, confound your crystal.
Confound all crystals.
I always did hate the things. I -
- Are you a magician?
- I have some skill.
Oh, say no more. I -
Anyhow, I - I must have this horse.
So I suppose you must have my daughter.
Mmm.
I will never marry him.
I would rather die.
I will go to my sister, who's married to he sultan of Samarkand.
She will protect me.
Go back to the garden. You will find someone there whom we thought was the djinni of the pool.
Tell him of our misfortune, and tell him that I will wait for him in Samarkand.
Yes, Princess.
Your Highness, the princess is nowhere to be found.
She is gone. We have searched
the whole garden.
- We have found only two beggars.
- Bring them here.
Jaffar! Jaffar!
Jaffar!
At last, face to face, man to man, sword to sword.
Give me a sword!
Allah will judge!
Great sultan, I speak the truth.
My eyes bear witness.
Ahmad!
My eyes!
I'm blind!
Ahmad!
Listen, great sultan,
I know the truth.
You must know who this man is!
And this - Listen, good people.
- Son of a dog.
- Allah.
By this, my magic rune... be what your fathers were... and bay the moon.
And this is my curse:
You shall remain a dog... and you shall walk in the darkness of the blind... until I hold her in my arms.
And now, dispensers of bounty, you know why a blind man with his dog... searches the world for a lost love, and with little enough hope.
Yet without that hope, there would be nothing.
And Allah is merciful.
Allah is merciful indeed, for the one that you seek is here.
If you mock me,
Allah will not forgive.
I do not mock. Your princess was captured by slave traders and sold here in our slave market.
The richest merchant in the town
bought her.
But no sooner was she taken to his house than she fell into the strangest trance.
She lives, but is as dead.
No doctor can restore her.
Night and day she calls upon the djinni of the pool.
- I was that djinni!
- And you alone can bring her back to life.
Can you take me where she is?
O djinni, shall I never see you again?
- Never?
- Lead me to her.
Why have you come?
To find you.
- How long have you been searching?
- From the beginning of time.
Now that you've found me, how long will you stay?
Till the end of time.
The dream - my dream - always the same dream.
This is no dream.
Ahmad!
Finish the masquerade.
Don't look at me like that.
Suffering has left its mark.
For me, your beauty will always be as I first saw it - never changing.
Your eyes -They're so strange.
So full of pain.
One cannot go through fire and not be scorched.
Ahmad, you must go.
The master has returned.
I will hide you, and when the master sleeps in the heat of the noon...
I'll bring her to you.
Quiet.
From now you're not only mine.
You belong to the princess as well.
Stay and guard her for me.
Blind. He's blind.
It is in your power to restore his sight.
There is, in this town, a famous doctor who would, at your request, cure him.
Take me.
Is the doctor here, on this ship?
Yes. He's waiting for you.
Open this door.
Open it!
Bring him nearer.
Nearer.
How do you find your dog's life, hmm?
Mmm. Strange how an unpleasant child can be a decent dog.
Throw him overboard.
Welcome.
- Jaffar!
- Yes.Jaffar.
It's always Jaffar.
Since you left your palace,
I have kept you safe.
When you rode hopeless and lost in the desert, who guided you?
When you were sold in the slave market,
who bought you♪
Always Jaffar.
It was in my house you were cared for, to sleep your sleep... and dream to its end... your first dream of love.
It was I who woke you.
No. It was Ahmad.
I was told there was a doctor here... who could restore his sight.
But I am that doctor.
The same moment that I hold you in my arms...
Ahmad will see.
Take me in your arms.
My eyes!
Hey! Ahmad!
Ahmad!
Can you see?
I'm Abu again!
Abu!
- Abu, where is she?
- She's with him -Jaffar- on the ship.
What good are my eyes to me without her?
Is there nothing for you without her?
Nothing.
No. No.
I have powers that could force you to my will.
But I want more than they can give.
I want your love.
Forget Ahmad.
He's no longer blind.
And for a man with eyes, the world is full of women.
Only I am cursed... that I can see only you.
Little fool. Trying to end your life before it has begun.
I tell you, Ahmad has forgotten.
Look!
It's Ahmad!
Wind!
Wind!
Wind!
Whip yourself, winds of heaven!
Whip till you wail aloud!
Ahmad!
Ahmad!
Ahmad!
Why do you refuse to obey your destiny?
You behave like a slave girl.
I am a slave girl.
You could command me.
Try. Ask what you will.
Would you take me back to Basra?
- Helmsman!
- Master!
Northward to Basra.
This is a place of desolation.
It is the most beautiful garden in the world.
If there were ever flowers in it, they've vanished, like cancer.
And the pool - so dark with weeds... you can't even see your own reflection in it.
I'm not looking for my own reflection.
Father, I don't want to go to Bagdad with Jaffar.
- But, my dear-
- Don't let him take me.
- Don't!
- Oh, there, there, there, there, there, there.
Well, if you don't want to go to Bagdad with him, you shan't.
No. Never. Never, never, never.
Never while I live. There.
- There. Oh.
What is it?
The newest magical toy: the silver maid.
Does she do anything more?
She can embrace you.
But any of my wives will do that.
Her embrace will thrill you... as no other woman ever has... or ever will.
Do you mean I might get rid of all my wives... and have a collection of these things?
She tickles!
Guards!
Make ready for Bagdad.
Free! Free!
Free! Free! Free!
Free! Free! Free!
Free again!
Free, after 2,000 years!
2,000 years ago,
King Solomon, master of all the djinns... imprisoned me within that bottle.
For me, this is the first moment of my new freedom.
For you -
For you, this is the last moment of your life.
My life?
Your life!
In a moment I shall lift my foot and crush you... insect, beetle, worm that you are!
But, sheik of spirits,
Ifished you out of the sea.
I opened your bottle. I let you out.
You can't be so ungrateful.
Ungrateful?
Slaves are not grateful.
Not for their freedom.
Listen.
Inside my bottle for the first thousand years...
I swore that I'd enrich the one that freed me with all the riches of the earth.
But in the second thousand years, my imprisoned spirit turned to vengeance... on all that lived and were free.
And I swore that I'd kill him that freed me to satisfy that hate.
Are you ready?
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!
Please, before I die, may I -
May I ask one question?
Ask.
How comes it that you, as big as a mountain... could ever get into that bottle
I can hold in my hand?
You weren't ever in it really, were you?
- Of course I was.
- Oh, no, you weren't.
- I was!
- You weren't!
What? You dare doubt?
If I'm going to die in a moment, I can dare anything, and I say it's impossible.
- Impossible?
- And I don't believe you.
- Take care.
- And never shall.
- Never?
- Nothing can make me!
- Nothing?
- Nothing. Unless I see it with my own eyes.
Then, dog of an unbeliever, before you die... you shall see, with me, nothing is impossible!
You shall see and believe!
Now, you great, overblown belch!
Let me out! Let me out!
Just because you were bigger than me, you thought you could bully.
- Let me out! Let me out!
Product of inflation.
Descendant of a stink. Let you out?
I'm going to throw you back into the sea.
- This time forever.
- Oh, no. Mercy! Mercy, O Master!
- What's that?
- O great and merciful master!
- Say that again.
- O great and merciful master... let me out, and I'll grant you three wishes.
- Three wishes?
- Your first three wishes shall come true.
- You swear?
- I swear.
By King Solomon, master of all the djinn?
By King Solomon, the master of all the djinn... the oath that no spirit can break.
- And you'll behave? No threatening and shouting?
- No.
- No what?
- No, Master.
Now, don't make so much noise again.
You frightened me before.
Master, I hear and obey.
That's better.
All bullies must learn manners in the end.
I'm hungry.
Can't think with my stomach empty.
I wish I had some of those sausages
Mother used to make.
Your sausages, Master.
That was the first wish, Master.
Two more remain.
Name them.
Don't you hurry me.
I've got to be careful.
Two more.
You know what I wish?
Tell me. Where is my friend Ahmad?
Master, to know that, you must look into the All-Seeing Eye.
- Then give me the eye.
- Master, I can take you where it is... but not even I can steal it for you.
Steal? Huh!
I'll see to that.
- Little braggart. What have you ever stolen?
- What haven't I?
A key from its lock, ring from its finger, money from its purse, the strength of a djinni -
And the tongue of a liar!
But he who would steal the All-Seeing Eye... from the very brow of the goddess must be neither a thief nor a braggart, but a hero.
I always wanted to be a hero.
Come on!
Then catch on to my hair.
All right.
But mind you, this is not my second wish yet.
Now I'm rather helping you.
Yes, Master.
Djinni! Djinni!
I'm frightened!
I hear!
All right, Master?
I think so.
Where are we now?
Above the roof of the world.
Has the world got a roof?
Of course, supported by seven pillars.
And the seven pillars are set on the shoulders of a djinni whose strength is beyond thought.
And the djinni stands on an eagle... and the eagle on a bull, and the bull on a fish.
And the fish swims in the Sea of Eternity.
Where are we going?
On the highest peak of the highest mountain of the world... where earth meets the sky, and there is the Temple of the Dawn.
And in the great hall of the temple is the goddess of light.
And in the head of the goddess is the All-Seeing Eye.
And now, my little braggart... you can be a thief and a hero all in one.
A hero.

Djinni, help!
Djinni!
Is this the All-Seeing Eye?
Not for 2,000 years will she grow another.
For a hundred generations of men, she will not know their doings.
- Now shall I know what happened to Ahmad?
- Look.
Look hard.
It's true. It's Ahmad.
Help!
Help!
Help!
- Help!
- Help!
Now my second wish.
Take me to him.
To hear is to obey, little master of the world.
Hold tight, little brother.
We have to return half across the world.
Don't be afraid, Ahmad!
- It's me, Abu!
- Abu!
Put me down!
Put me down!
Gently, you clumsy good-for-nothing!
- Abu!
- Ahmad!
Allah be merciful.
It's a real djinni.
Yes. He's mine, and I am his master.
I am your master, aren't I?
To hear is to obey, O Master!
See? He brought me here, and he'll carry us away.
What's he laughing like that for?
I don't like the sound of it.
Oh, he's all right.
He's a bit big to talk to.
That's the worse part about him.
You have to shout so much.
Hey, you up there!
- What are you laughing for?
- For my freedom. It is at hand.
You get us out of this place.
- Your third wish?
- No, no, no, no.
Not yet.
He is big, but he is sharp.
I've got to be careful.
Only one wish left.
I have only one wish.
Oh, I know all about that.
Your princess.
If only I could see her again.
Is that all?
I don't need to waste a wish for that.
- Look.
- What's that?
Look into it - hard, hard.
Keep staring into it.
You'll see her.
It's true!
A blue rose?
I've heard about that.
That -
That's the Blue Rose of Forgetfulness.
If she inhales its fragrance, she'll forget... everything.
Blue roses?
Exquisite.
Who are you?
I don't know.
I've forgotten.
Why have you suffered?
Have I suffered?
I don't remember.
It seems I was in love.
Whom did you love?
I cannot tell.
I don't know any longer.
I can't look anymore!
There are worse things than blindness.
Knowledge can be more terrible than ignorance, if one can do nothing.
Nothing.
Why did you give me this?
Take it back and break it into a thousand pieces.
I only stole it to help you.
You stole it because you enjoy stealing.
Without my stealing, you'd be dead.
I wish I were dead.
I wish I'd never seen you.
I wish -
I wish I were in Bagdad.
I wish you were!
Ahmad! Ahmad!
Ahmad! Ahmad!
Ahmad!
Ahmad!
Where are you?
Where you wished him - on his way to Bagdad.
Then take me out of this place.
Don't you hear? I want to get out.
You stay where you are.
You're a clever little man, little master of the universe... but mortals are weak and frail.
If their stomach speaks, they forget their brain.
If their brain speaks, they forget their hearts.
And if their hearts speak-
If their hearts speak, they forget everything!
Am I not your master?
No longer.
You've had your three wishes, and I am free!
Free!
Djinni! Djinni!
Come back!
Don't leave me here!
Don't let me die! Djinni!
And farewell, little master of the universe.
Farewell! Free!
Free! Free!
Everything of the past is forgotten.
You have been in love with me.
You are in love with me.
You will always love me.
Everything of the past is forgotten.
I have been in love with you.
I am in love with you.
I shall always love you.
Hey!
Where'd he go?
Where'd he go?
Jaffar!
Ahmad.
Let's go!
Put them in prison.
Chain them to opposite walls.
In the morning, they die the death of a thousand cuts.
I have failed, my love.
Forgive me.
I have no regrets.
We are together.
And shall be for the rest of our lives.
We shall never again know the torture of being apart.
And if death is not the end, we shall go on together.
Abu and I parted quarreling.
I wish I could tell him I'm sorry.
Abu, my friend... good-bye and forgive me.
No. I won't say good-bye.
I'll help.
But how? How?
If I can't help, I won't see!
Welcome, our prince.
Welcome, little prince.
Father of a beard, there's some mistake.
I'm not a prince.
I'm only a thief.
For you we have been waiting twice 2,000 years.
Oh, no. Not waiting for me... because I didn't know I was coming, and I don't know how I've come.
Who are you, father of miracles?
And where am I?
This is the Land of Legend... where everything is possible when seen through the eyes of youth.
We are the remnant of the Golden Age.
Golden because gold was nothing.
No more than the sand beneath your feet...
or the stone that we became.
How did you become stone?
We were petrified with horror... by the evil done among men... when they ceased to be children... and to believe in the beauty of the impossible.
But whenever the heart of a child
returns to us...
and comes into us... we live again.
And so, as that child... you are to be my successor.
Now, come with me... and I will present you with two insignia... of true kingship.
Here they are.
Aim this only at injustice, and you cannot fail.
Oh, no, father of kindness.
I don't want it.
I don't want to be a king.
- I only want to save my friend.
- Well, this will help you.
Take it. And now...
I do homage... for you are king... and all in our kingdom is yours... except that carpet, which I keep for myself.
For on that carpet... which flies when it is bidden -
"Fly, carpet" -
I shall go to paradise
at the hour appointed.
It is told,
though Allah is wiser or more merciful...
there was in the past of the ages
a king among kings...
a master of arms and of armies,
of vessels and auxiliaries.
And this master of time and people
was an oppressor to both...
until the earth was as pitch
on the faces ofhis subjects and his slaves...
and they groaned together in secret...
and were slayed in the marketplace.
But a wise man
among the sages of Bagdad...
comforted them
with a prophecy, saying...
"In the fullness of time,
a liberator shall come upon you...
and this shall be the sign ofhim."
O Allah,
I know you don't much like stealing.
I'll never steal again.
You can trust me.
Just this once more.Just this little carpet so as to get to Bagdad in time.
When the old king's hour comes... he won't want a carpet to fly to paradise.
Then you, O Allah, will take him by the hand... gentle and kind as he is... and lead him into eternal bliss.
Aren't I right?
But I must go to Bagdad to save my friend.
It's a question of minutes.
You must see that.
O Allah, lord ofjustice,
let me steal.
Fly, carpet.
Wait.
Fly, carpet!
Why do you close your eyes?
There's little time left to see him.
The people cried,
"We shall look for him in the clouds indeed...
"for if the great are powerless
to save us from this tyrant...
how can one of no account avail?"
And the reader
of the Milky Way replied...
"Have faith, trust in Allah...
"for there, one day in the blue,
you shall see a boy...
"the lowest of the low,
mounted on a cloud...
"and that cloud shall be as strong
as the hills beneath the snow...
"and from the ranges of the sky...
he shall destroy this tyrant
with the arrow ofjustice."
The horse!
Up, quickly!
Ahmad!
Jaffar!
My people,
I owe everything to Abu... and when he grows into a man, he shall be my grand vizier.
He shall be sent to the best school in Bagdad... and all the wise men of the East shall teach him all the wisdom of the world.
He shall be the wisest of men,
and in those future days... when he will be full of knowledge, science and dignity... he will be the shining example for the youths of Bagdad... and they may remember how the little thief became the dignifi -
Hey! Abu! Where are you going?
You've got what you wanted.
Now, I'm going to find what I want.
- What's that?
- Some fun.
- An adventure at last!
Look, Mytyl. There's one.
Come on. Quick.
Give me the stick.
Get the crumbs.
We got him.
We got him!
- Do you think it's a thrush?
- I hope so.
No use fluttering.
I got you now.
- Let me see him, Mytyl.
- Be careful, Tyltyl.
You'll get him excited.
Hey, there.| Who goes there?
- Oh, a forester.
- Run! Quick!
What would that forester have did if he had caught us?
- Have done, Tyltyl. Have done.
- What would he had done?
- Put us in a dungeon and chopped off our heads.
- Just for one little bird?
- He's got a whole forest of them.
- It's against the law.
Mytyl?
- Oh, Myty.
- Oh, hallo, Angela.
What have you got there?
Something for Christmas?
It's a bird- a very rare bird.
It's a thrush, we think.
I trapped it in the royal forest.
I don't suppose... you wouldn't let me trade you something for it, would you?
I should say not.
Uh, what have you got?
I'd let you have Katrina.
You always liked her.
Yes, when she was new.
She's only been sewed up in that one little place.
I'm sorry.
Besides, I promised this bird to another little girl for Christmas.
Oh, she wouldn't mind, Mytyl.
Please, Myty.
Won't you trade?
Angela, close the window!
- You know better than that.
- It's Mytyl.
- She's got a bird.
- Oh, yes, yes... but aren't you sick enough, dear, without catching your death of cold?
- Come now. Close the window.
- Oh, Mother.
I've always wanted a bird like that.
Please, ask her to give her to me.
That one?
She'd never give anybody anything.
Who's the little girl you promised a bird for Christmas?
- Who do you suppose? Me.
- Then why didn't you say so?
The next time I go hunting,
I'll leave you at home.
Tyltyl, did you ever see such a Christmas tree?
Look at all the children.
Everyone’s having fun, aren't they?
Everyone except those fiddlers.
That must be hard work.
Is that Santa Claus with the white hair?
No,you goose. That's the butler.
Good evening.
We're not doing anything. Just looking.
- But wouldn't you like some cake?
- Oh, thank you, sir.
Come along. Help yourselves, both of you.
- Don't take any, Tyltyl.
- Huh?
We may not be rich, but we're not beggars, thank you.
Come, Tyltyl.
- Hello, Mummy.
- A fine hour to be getting home.
- Look, Mummy.
We caught the most beautiful bird.
- Where have you been?
- What kept you?
- Don't you want to see it?
I want to see your hands clean.
Put that down and wash up, both of you. Go.
Tylo, get away from there.
Keep away from this cage now.
Hello, Daddy.
I didn't know you were home.
Your mummy had to set the table, Mytyl.
Did you forget the time?
Uh, you know, Daddy,
I think the village clock is slow.
Did you hear that, Mummy?
The village clock's slow.
- She has eyes, hasn't she?
- Yes.
Didn't you see it was growing dark?
Well, I did.
But Angela Berlingot stopped us.
- I had to talk to her.
She's sick, you know.
- Hmm.
Then we looked in at the rich children's house.
And what do you think, Daddy?
They have a Christmas tree as high as the ceiling.
- Well.
- Never mind all that. Come along.
Get to your places. Come along.
Your father's been working in the forest all day and he's hungry.
For what we are about to receive... and for all thy, bounteous blessings,
O Lord, make us truly, thankful.
- Amen.
- Amen.
- Mytyl, Tylette's after your bird!
- Tylette!
Get away from here!
Get away from this bird.
How many times have I told you, Mytyl, not to trap birds in the woods?
- But, Daddy, it's such fun.
- It's not much fun for the bird.
- But I need it.
- What for?
To sing for us.
What do you think, Mummy?
Angela Berlingot wanted me to give it to her.
Well, why didn't you?
It'd be something to cheer her up.
- Poor mite. Sick in bed all winter.
- It's not my fault she's sick.
- It's your fault you're selfish.
- You have so much that she hasn't, Mytyl.
- What have I got?
- Health, for one thing, to run free and play.
- Oh, that isn't anything.
- Oh, isn't it?
- I wouldn't like to stay in bed all day.
- I wouldn't mind.
That will do, Mytyl.
Stop talking and eat your supper.
- Mummy?
- What is it, Myty?
Why do we have to be so poor all the time?
Poor? Us?
Well, we are.
We can't even have a party for Christmas.
You have a roof over your head, haven't you, and warm clothes?
- These old things?
- And plenty to eat.
But nothing I like, nothing good.
Not like those rich children have- cakes, candies... dolls to play with, pretty dresses, everything.
- I have nothing!
- That's not true, dear.
- You have lots of things.
- What?
You have a father who works for you.
- And a mother who cooks and cleans and mends.
- What's that... when other people have so much more?
Big houses, servants, carriages that drive them.
And look at us.
Look at this old place.
Stop it, Mytyl!
Stop it at once.
- You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
- I'm not ashamed.
- I hate it. I hate it all!
- Be quiet!
One more word and you'll go straight to bed.
You're an ungrateful child.
One more word and you'll go straight to bed.
You're an ungrateful child.
- I don't care.
- Thoughtless, thankless.
- I'm so unhappy.
- Well, of course our unhappy,.
If you don't mend your ways, you'll never be happy. Never!
- Oh, it's you, Wilhelm.
- Come in, Wilhelm.
Have some supper with us.
Sortie, but I have no time.
- I'm afraid I have bad news.
- Why, what's wrong?
Orders from Andreas Hofer to mobilize at once.
- Mobilize?
- Oh, no.
Napoleon's soldiers are on the march again.
They're heading toward the frontier.
As close as that?
- Well, we-we stood them off before, didn't we?
- And we'll do it again.
We assemble in the village square tomorrow at noon.
- I'll be there.
- Till tomorrow then.
War.
- Daddy!
- Oh, Daddy.
- I don't want you to go.
- I must go, dear.
Why do they have to have war?
What makes war anyway?
The same thing that makes trouble everywhere- greed, selfishness, those not content with what they have.
But you're not like that, Daddy.
Why should you have to go?
That's what's wrong about it, Mytyl.
You can't be unhappy inside yourself... without making others unhappy too.
Remember that.
Come, come.
Finish your suppers, all of you.
Is there any more, Mummy?
You don't get stew like this in the army.
- Good night, dear.
- Mummy?
- Yes, dear?
- I'm sorry for the way I behaved at supper.
That's what you always say,
Mytyl, that you're sorry... but the next day you do the same thing right over again.
I know I do.
I don't know why.
Well, you must find out why.
Otherwise, you'll always be unhappy and discontented. You don't want that, do you?
- No.
- You want to be happy, don't you?
Yes, Mummy. Like you.
You're happy all the time, aren't you?
Well, nearly all the time, dear.
Don't worry, Mummy.
Daddy will come back.
Tyltyl, are you asleep?
No, I don't think so.
Are you?
How could I be asleep when I'm talking to you?
- Did you hear someone knocking?
- I heard something.
- I'd better get Daddy.
- Wait for me, Mytyl.
Didn't you hear me knocking?
- Why, yes, but-
- Well, why didn't you let me in then?
Who are you?
Why, haven't your eyes?
Can't you see?
- I'm Betylune.
- Betylune?
Yes, the Faity Betylune.
Well, it's a little dark to see clearly.
Dark?
Well, it needn't be.
Light up there.
It- It lighted, all by itself.
- How did you do that?
- Oh, don't ask foolish questions.
But Daddy can't even do that.
Hurry now, quick.
Hop into your clothes and be off.
- You've got to find the blue bird.
- The blue bird.
Of course. The bird that is blue.
The blue bird.
But why? Why would we find it?
Why? You want to be happy, don't you?
Of course. But what do
I want with a blue bird?
Oh, what a stupid girl you are.
Don't you know that the blue bird means happiness?
How could it?
Well, didn't I say it did?
Now get dressed, both of you.
Or better still, I'll do it for you.
Quiet now. Quiet.
Quiet. Be clothed!
Look, Tyltyl.
Even your boots are laced up.
Mummy wouldn't mind having you around all the time.
She wouldn't, eh?
Don't stand there staring.
Come along. We've no time to lose.
But, ma'am, tell me where to find the blue bird.
It isn't as easy as all that.
You must look for it yourself- in the past, in the future, everywhere.
- Are you coming with us?
- Certainly not. I've other things to do.
We're not allowed to go places alone at night.
Did I say you had to go alone?
You have friends, haven't you?
- Can we take Daddy?
- There's your dog Tylo.
Take him. He might be of some help to you.
And Tylette, your cat.
Take her, if you wish.
- Wake up, Tylo.
- Wake up!
Wake up, you lazy, creature.|
Stand up like a man.
- Mytyl, look!
- Tylo!
Mytyl. My little Mytyl.
And Tyltyl. Master Tyltyl.
I can talk. At last, I can talk.
Oh, if I only could have the day you fell in the lake.
I tried so hard to tell you to keep away.
- Who are you?
- Quiet. We've no time for your gabble.
- We're in a dreadful hurry, Tylo.
- Why?
- I don't know, but she said we were.
- Quiet!
Tylette! Wake up!
Wake up, I say!
Can she talk too?
Well, naturally, if the dog can.
- Oh, Tylette, I'm so glad.
We've got to find a blue bird.
- A blue bird?
I'll come. I'll help you.
I love going places.
You'll come too, won't you, Tylette?
Why not? It might be amusing.
- I don't like the way she said that.
- Why, Tylo.
Come on. Come on now, all of you.
Be on your way. Hurry!
We shouldn't take Tylette with us.
She's treacherous.
I heard what you said, you old sniffle-snoot.
- I'll chew you to ribbons.
- Uncouth, isn't he?
What are you waiting for?
Come along!
Don't stand there gabbling all night.
Come along.
Well, what are you waiting for? Be off!.
- But which way shall we go?
- Oh, I told you.
You must look everywhere.
- But we'll get lost.
- It's so dark.
Oh, don't cry before you're hurt.
I'll take care of that. Light!
Appear.
It's the queen.
Oh, what little dunces you are not to know this brilliant lady... when you've seen her hundreds of times.
This is Light.
Light, may I present Mytyl and Tyltyl.
- How do you do, Light?
- How do you do?
And my name's Tylette.
How do you do?
There's no need to be formal.
We're old friends.
Where would you like to go?
I shall be your guide.
- We're not quite sure where to go.
- Why don't you use your head?
Hasn't it occurred to you that the blue bird might be hiding in the past?
But where is the past?
Do you know the way?
Why, of course.
The past is just behind us.
Come. I'll show you.
Now, remember.
Somewhere there's a blue bird.
Find it. Never give up till you do.
If you fail, nothing can save you.
Find the blue bird.
We'll find it. I promise.
Listen, you.
I know we've never been friends... but now we've got to work together.
- We can't allow the children to go through with this search.
- Why not? Why can't we?
Don't you see?
We're free now.
If they succeed, if they do find the blue bird... we'll have to go back to just what we wereumb slaves to man.
That's the way I like it.
Man is the master. We must obey him.
Oh! I always knew you were a fool.
If they want to look for a blue bird or a pink owl, I'm going to help them.
- The road to the past lies through here.
- But this is the graveyard.
That's the only way to the past.
- You must lead now.
- Aren't you coming?
Oh, no. Light has no business in a graveyard.
But I'll be waiting for you.
- Suppose we don't find the way?
- Are you afraid to try?
- Of course I'm not afraid.
- Then you'll find the way, dear.
- Who's afraid of what?
- We're going through the graveyard.
Oh, is that so?
The-The graveyard!
One more thing.
And this is most important.
It is now nearly midnight.
- Oooh!
- You must be back within the hour.
Otherwise, you will remain in the past... forever.
- Mytyl, I don't think we better go.
- Hush.
Well, follow me.
- This place is bad enough in the daytime.
- Fraidy cat!
Fraidy dog, please.
I'm scared, Mytyl.
There's nothing to be... afraid of.
I often come here... just to browse around.
When you're not browsing up dark alleys.
What's that?
- A g-g-ghost.
- Oh, Mytyl!
There's no such thing as a... ghost.
- There is too. I saw one once.
- Oh, no, Tylo!
I've met dozens of ghosts.
Most of them are perfectly charming.
- Tylo, where are you going?
- I just r-r-remembered something I got to do.
Oh, no, you can't leave us now.
Well, then, I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll go over the wall and around- the graveyard... and I'll- I'll see you-
- What is this I'm in?
- That's an open grave.
There goes our brave protector.
Shall we continue?
- Let's turn back, Mytyl.
- Don't you be a coward too.
Oh, it's only at midnight you have to be careful.
- Why?
- What happens then?
Midnight is the witching hour.
The graves open.
- The dead arise.
- The dead!
Tylette, you're just trying to scare us.
You're not afraid. Not very.
Well, I'm not.
- But I'd rather not see any graves open.
- Why not?
It's rather thrilling. Come.
While we're waiting, I'll show you some of my favorite tombstones.
We've no time for that now.
We've got to go on to the past.
But this is the past, right here.
Oh, no, it can't be.
Light said to go through the graveyard.
But Light doesn't know. I do.
Tylette, don't go so fast.
Tylette, where are you?
- Here I am.
- Where?
Tylette! Tylette!
The clock!
Three, four-
Five, s-s-six-
It's midnight, Tyltyl.
I don't want to see any dead people!
- Neither do I.
- Oh, Mytyl, Mytyl!
Tyltyl, look!
I'm afraid!
But there aren't any dead people. Look.
Do you suppose Mummy was right?
You know, she always told us nobody ever really dies.
Oh, let's go, Mytyl.
I don't like it here.
Oh, look. It's Granny's and Grandpa's graves.
- I wish they were here with us.
- Me too.
I wouldn't be so afraid.
Somebody must be thinking of us.
I'm beginning to feel quite strong.
I have pins and needles all down my legs.
We're going to have visitors.
They seem to be quite near.
Now I can get on with my carving.
I've been at this one for nearly a whole year.
That's because we're so seldom awake.
- Grandpa.
- The children!
Granny! Grandpa!
My dears! Mytyl.
Tyltyl! Oh.
Another hug.
A big one this time.
It's months and months that you've forgotten us.
Yes, the last time, let me see, it was Easter morning.
The church bells were ringing.
Easter? Oh, we didn't go out that day.
We both had very bad colds.
- No, but you thought of us.
- Yes, we missed you.
Well, every time you think of us, we wake up and see you again.
But we thought you were dead.
No, dear. Only when we're forgotten.
Will they never learn back there?
The garden, the house... everything’s just the same.
Oh, Granny, I'm so glad to be here!
Come in, children. Come in.
I'm afraid we can't, Granny.
We can't stay very long.
What's that? What's that?
Can't stay very long?
- I'm afraid not.
- But I want to bake you an apple tart.
I wish we could stay, Granny.
Oh, look, Grandpa, you haven't finished little Ko-Ko yet.
What chance have I got when
I'm always asleep?
- Would you like to see my workshop, Tyltyl?
- Oh, yes!
Come along then.
- Don't be long, Tyltyl.
- Oh, you're in no hurry.
Yes, but we are. We must be back within the hour.
What time is it, Granny?
See? As soon as you think of it, it comes to life.
Now, come along. Sit down.
It's only 20 past 12:00.
- But the sun is shining.
- It's always shining here when you think of us.
Granny, the reason why, we're here, we've got to find a blue bird.
It's terribly important.
A blue bird? Oh, yes.
I'm sure we've got one.
Really, Granny?
Where? Show me!
Oh, all right, child, if we must.
We'll look in the birdhouse.
Come along.
There you are, dear.
All sorts and colors.
You can have any, one you like.
Isn't there a blue one?
Why, yes, there's a blue one.
That one up there singing.
Why, Granny, he isn't blue.
He's black.
Black? That's strange.
He's always looked blue to me.
There isn't one here, not a single blue bird.
Won't one of these do?
Oh, no. Betylune said it must be blue.
She said to look everywhere.
- This is the past, isn't it?
- Yes, dear.
But perhaps your blue bird isn't in the past... and you'll have to look somewhere else.
- I better go then.
- Oh, no, not yet, not yet.
Will you show me how to carve one too, Grandpa?
Yes, if you'll come more often to see us.
Mytyl, what do you think?
These little people whistle.
- I know that. Come on. We've got to go.
- Aw, you can't go yet.
- Can't you stay a few minutes longer?
- We shouldn't, Granny.
But I wanted you to hear them.
I've taught them to whistle a tune.
Anything you like.
You name it, Mytyl.
- Uh, how about ''Farmer in the Dell''?
- Oh, yes.
Aw, who wants that silly thing?
How about a ''Lay-de-o''?
- That's the one.
- Yes, ''Lay-de-o.''
- You used to sing that to me in my cradle. Remember?
- Yes, dear.
Look, Mytyl. This one plays music too.
Nice, dear. Just like old times.
We've really got to go now, Granny.
Come on, Tyltyl. What time is it?
Why, it's still just 20 past 12:00.
Oh, my goodness! Something's wrong!
Tyltyl, we've got to run.
Oh, no! Don't go! Don't go.
If you stay, I'll bake you the biggest apple tart you've ever tasted.
We haven't time, Granny, really.
- Good-bye, Grandpa.
- Good-bye, Tyltyl.
- Don't wait too long to come to us again.
- I won't.
Good-bye, darling.
Think of us often.
- You don't know how much it means.
- We will, Granny.
- Good-bye, Tyltyl.
- Good-bye, Granny.
Come on, Tyltyl.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Always in such a hurry.
I'll never get this finished.
Couldn't something have made them stay?
Not even my apple tarts.
Never mind, dear.
It was nice to have them remember us at all.
I suppose so.
Perhaps it won't be so long... till the next time.
Well, they're lost, that's all there is to it.
If they're lost, they're lost.
It's their own fault for straying into the graveyard.
- Why didn't you follow them, see which way they went?
- Why didn't you?
You're so loyal and brave.
I think I see them coming.
There they are!
- Tylo!
- I thought you were lost.
Tylette. What happened to you?
- Well, what happened to you?
- We've been with Granny and Grandpa.
In the Land of Memory.
Did you find the blue bird?
No, there were no blue birds there. Not one.
- I could have told you that in the first place.
- Why didn't you then?
Because no one took the trouble to inquire.
What do you think we ought to do now?
You haven't found the blue bird.
You must keep on looking.
All this fuss about a blue bird.
I could be happy with a big juicy beefsteak.
Why don't you go to the Land of Luxury?
There's plenty to eat there.
Everything you can think of.
Do you think we'd find the blue bird there?
- No, dear, I don't.
- Why, not?
Everyone has everything they want there.
Where would be a better place to look for the blue bird?
If they've got beefsteaks, it won't hurt to look.
We might find the blue bird there.
Very well. Go ahead, if you want to.
- How do we get to the Land of Luxury?
- It's very easy.
- We take the first side road.
- Will you wait for us?
Yes, dear. Just beyond.
But don't let them keep you very long.
- It isn't wise to spend too much time with luxuries.
- We won't.
I'll show you the way.
[ Doorbell Chiming }
Yes, miss?
- Are the Luxury’s at home?
- What name shall I say?
Mytyl and friends.
Won't you step in?
This way, please.
Wait here, please.
There. What did I tell you?
Isn't it magnificent?
Mmm. I smell dinner.
Oh, Mytyl, these banisters, wouldn't you love to slide down them?
Shh.
Rich people never slide down banisters.
Mr. and Mrs. Luxuty!
How do you do?
How do you do?
How do you do?
Are you Mrs. Luxury?
Yes. Yes, indeed, I am.
And this is Mr. Luxury.
How do you do?
How do you do?
- This is my brother, Tyltyl.
- Charmed.
- Oh, and Tylette.
- Charmed.
What an enchanting place.
Such exquisite taste.
It's simple, but we like it.
We're looking for a blue bird, and we thought you might have one.
A blue bird?
We're having pheasant with truffles.
Do you prefer blue birds?
How do you prepare one?
- Oh, we didn't want to eat it.
- Oh, how nice.
- I say, old fellow, do you like desserts?
- Oh, yes, sir.
Then you shall have them- dozens of them... with maraschino cherries and whipped cream.
You can have anything you like.
You can do anything you like.
- Can I even slide down this banister?
- Oh, certainly.
I'd join you, but I've had my slide for today.
- You like dolls, don't you, and pretty dresses?
- Oh, yes, ma'am, I do.
- She's never had very many.
- Oh, I can see that.
In a party, dress with some jewels... you'll really be quite presentable.
- Oh, thank you.
- Oh, you're too kind, Mrs. Luxury.
Oh, not at all. She's such a darling.
Come along upstairs.
- Come along.
- Come along, old man.
Oh. Come on, Tylo.
[ Mrs. Luxury }
Tylo?
[ Mr. Luxury }
Who's that fellow?
Oh, that's Tylo. He's with us.
I'm afraid we haven't any more guest rooms.
Perhaps your friend wouldn't mind bunking in the servants' quarters.
- Is that all right, Tylo?
- Well, if there's no room in the house.
Beg pardon, sir.
The servants' quarters are all full.
However, there's a most comfortable place in the Kennels.
- Kennels?
- Splendid! Splendid! Show him the way.
Come, Fido.
- Tylo!
- Tylo.
- You'll be all right, Tylo.
- Now don't you worry.
He'll be taken care of,
I promise you.
Come upstairs, darlings.
All the way up.
- Let me give you a piggyback.
- Oh, yes!
This way to the kennels.
I might have known
I'd end up in the doghouse.
Go away. I said, go away.
But you're getting on on the wrong side, sir.
I'll get on any side that I like!
- You're not big enough to get on by yourself, sir.
- I am too!
- Stop this thing. Stop it, I say.
- Yes, miss. Just a moment.
Stop it at once.
I want to ride the pony.
Oh, be careful, miss.
- You get down, Tyltyl.
It's my turn to ride.
- It is not.
- It is too. You go ride on the merry-go-round.
- I don't like the merry-go-round.
- Well, it's my pony.
- It is not.
- The Luxury’s gave it to me!
- That's not true.
They gave it to both of us.
- Children. Children.
- It's my pony, isn't it, Groom?
- It is not!
- Let go of those reins.
- I won't!
- I'll make you. Get off this pony!
- I won't.
- You will too. Let go of me, you-
- Oh, sir.
- Little beast!
Oh, sir, please.|
- Oh, gracious!
- Mytyl! Tyltyl!
- Stop it, children! Stop it, I say!
- That'll do! Mytyl! Tyltyl!
- What the devil's all this?
- It's not my fault, sir, I swear.
- He pulled my hair.
- And she kicked me.
- I'll kick you again.
- Children.
Why didn't you think to get each of them a pony?
Then they wouldn't have anything to quarrel over.
Why didn't you? Well, don't stand there gaping.
Go and get another pony.
- Very good, sir.
- All right.
You can have this old pony, but they'll get me a better one.
Oh, no. You keep this one.
I'll take the better one.
- You will not. I'll get there first.
- Oh, no, you won't.
There just seems to be no satisfying them.
If you ask me, they're spoiled.
Oh, Mr. Luxury.
- May I come in?
- What is it? You ought to be in bed.
I was, but I couldn't go to sleep.
Oh! What did you do to your foot?
I didn't do anything to it. It's the gout.
And don't you touch it!
Oh, I wasn't going to touch it.
- Don't you even come near it.
- Does it hurt when I even come near it?
It hurts when you even look at it.
Now go on. Off to bed you go.
- Well, good night.
- Oh, good night, good night, good night.
- Mr. Luxury.
- Oh, are you still here?
Yes, sir.
Well, what do you want?
I thought you might like to read to me.
- Why should I?
- My daddy does sometimes at home.
Well, that's a silly idea, and you can tell your daddy I said so.
Yes, sir. Good night.
Good night.
- Mr. Luxury.
- Yes, what is it now?
Don't you like to talk things over with somebody before you go to bed?
Talk what things over?
Oh, nothing.
Do you mind if
I kiss you good night?
Good heavens!
I could shut my eyes and pretend it's Daddy.
A fine time of night to start playing games!
Oh, all right.
Come here.
- Be careful you don't touch my foot.
- Yes, sir.
Look out, you clumsy little wretch!
- Oh, I didn't mean it.
- Go on, get out!
Get out!
Tylo!
Tylo!
Oh, it's you.
Oh, Tylo, I've missed you so.
Missed me? You knew I was here, didn't you?
- What have you been doing?
- Nothing.
- Even the dogs here won't play with me.
- Why not, Tylo?
I have no pedigree.
Oh, Tylo, I'm unhappy too.
Oh, my little Mytyl.
Nobody here is kind.
Not really kind.
Not like Mummy and Daddy.
I wouldn't trade them for all the Mr. and Mrs. Luxury’s in the world.
Even if they are poor, huh?
Mummy and Daddy are not poor.
They just haven't any money.
There's a difference.
What do you say we get out of here?
Where's Tyltyl?
I don't know.
We're not speaking.
What? Not speaking?
What's this place doing' to us all?
We must get out of here.
But we can't.
We can't get away from the Luxury’s.
Just let 'empty to stop us. Come on.
You better get dressed.
Oh, Tyltyl, I'm so sorry for everything.
There's no use saying you're sorry now.
Please make up, Tyltyl.
I've been so lonely without you.
There. Now kiss and make up.
Quick, quick.
We're going to leave, Tyltyl, right now.
- Good, good! I'm ready!
- Shh! Where are your clothes?
- In there.
- Put them on. Quick.
- Hurry, Tyltyl.
- I will.
What'll we do if they catch us?
Don't you worry.
I'll get you out.
What is this? A conspiracy?
We're leaving this place, Tylette.
Leaving? Why?
Because we don't like it.
That's why.
I think it's a great mistake.
It's so very enjoyable here.
If you want to stay, stay.
We'd be better off without you.
Oh, no! We can't leave Tylette.
Have no fear, Mytyl.
I'll go along, for your sake.
I'm ready!
Come on! Quiet now.
- Tylette!
- It just... fell.
What was that?
What is it? What's happened?
What in thunder was that noise?
What is it? What's happened?
Don't stand there gaping at me. Answer me!
- Answer me!
- The urn at the top of the stairs, sir.
- What about the urn at the top of the stairs, sir?
- It's now at the bottom.
- Huh?
- Oh, Mr. Luxury, Mr. Luxury!
- What is it now?
- The children are gone.
- Gone?
- Yes, sir. Their beds are empty.
Where have they gone to?
Don't all stand there looking like fools!
Look for them!
Go on, look for them!
- Let's go.
- Don't be foolish.
- He'll catch us, Tylo.
- We'll outrun them. Go ahead.
There they go! After them!
After them! Come back!
Hey, come bacj!
Come bacj! Hey!
Let them go!
Well, of all the ill-mannered exhibitions!
I'm glad they've gone.
Well, maybe they know what they're doing.
Not at all! They're just too young to appreciate luxury.
And we're too old to escape from it.
Look, the moon's coming up.
That's not the moon.
That's Light coming to meet us.
You're tired, aren't you?
We shouldn't have gone there at all.
You didn't find the blue bird, did you?
We forgot to look.
That always happens there.
You wouldn't have found it anyway.
I'm afraid we've just wasted our time.
- You wouldn't want to go back, would you?
- Oh, no.
- Never. Never.
- Then you haven't wasted your time.
We almost didn't get away, at all.
- Thanks to Tylette.
- Oh, what did I do?
Oh, nothing at all.
Just crashed a statue and roused the whole house... to help us sneak away, quietly,.
- You've been seeing things, Tylo.
- You bet I have.
And someday I'm going to take you by the neck and shake your head right off.
Just try it, if you want to get your eyes scratched out.
Oh, stop it. Stop it, you two!
You do nothing but fight.
- What do you think we ought to do now?
- I think you ought to rest.
Tyltyl's almost asleep.
Why don't you sleep a little while too?
- I am tired.
- Then sleep.
I'll be back to wake you.
Father Oak!
Father Oak!
- Eh? Eh?
- Oh, there you are.
Oh, what-what's all the commotion?
I've been shouting my, lungs out for you.
- What's that?
- Didn't you hear me calling you?
- No.
- You get deafer and deafer.
It's the din of the woodsman's ax always ringing in my ears.
- Summon the others, will you?
- What others?
Pine, Elm, Walnut, Maple-
Summon them all!
Now what's up? From your tone, one would think the world was coming to an end.
If you don't do as I say, our world will come to an end.
- Oh, as bad as all that, eh?
- Worse.
- Hello! Hello!
- Summon them all! Willow, Lime, Beech!
Hello! Come along there, Beech!
Come on, Elm.|
We're waiting.
Hello.|
What's all the excitement? What's up?
Trees, what's the trouble?
- We don't know.
- Hello.|
Always something.
Nothing' but trouble!
Getting me up in the middle of the night!
The old Crab Apple.
Now what's the matter with her?
Stop that blubbering, Willow.
Save your weeping for the river.
I can't bear it. I can't.
Bear what?
Uh, things.
Just things.
You see what I'm up against?
Come along. We don't need her.
I've got to get back.
- Well, I guess there are enough of us here.
- Then speak up.
- What's the matter?
- Why are we here?
Children of the woodcutter, your mortal enemy... are on their way here, looking for the blue bird.
The blue bird?
I've put as many obstacles in their way as I can.
Now it's up to you.
What do you want us to do?
Frighten them. Terrify them.
Put the fear of the devil into them!
So that they'll forget what they came for and go back where they belong.
Remember what it means.
- Oak, I'll rely upon you.
- Yes.
- We'll fix them!
- That's right!
- It's going to be jolly, huh?
- Jolly? Are you all daft?
Didn't you hear what she said?
They're after the blue bird.
What good will it do to frighten them?
They'll only come back again and again.
- No, we must destroy them.
- Destroy them!
That's what man has done to us for centuries.
- Yes, they've felled us by thousands.
- And shivered our timbers.|
- He's right!
- They must not escape.
Go tell Wind.
Whip him into a frenzy.
Get even our enemies to help.
Fire, Lightning- Let them all know.
Tell them, if need be, we'll sacrifice even ourselves. Anything!
But there must be no mistake.
There must be no failure.
Those children must die!
- Oak's right!
- I'll beat them with my branches!
- We'll do away with them!
- Go! Go quickly, all of you!
Isn't it peaceful and quiet?
But I don't see any blue birds.
I don't see any birds at all.
Well, the trees are full of them. You'll see.
Oh, Mytyl, look at this big old tree.
Wouldn't Daddy love to chop it down?
Looks like a storm is blowing up.
We'd better go someplace till this blows over.
Mytyl, wait.|
Why, don't we hide in here?
First time a tree ever turned on me.
Tylo.| Here, I'll help you up.
Are you hurt?
It is a storm. I knew it.
- Looks more like a tornado.
- Don't get excited. There's no danger.
Come on! We'd better get out of here!
Come on, Tyltyl.
No, no! This way!
Mytyl! Mytyl!
- Are you hurt?
- I'm all right.
- Let's keep on going.
- Come on. I'll take care of you.
Follow me!
I know the way out!
- Let's go back!
- The storm's worse back there. Come on!
This way!
Come on!
Don't listen to her!
She's trying' to trap us!
Help! Help!
Save me!
- Tylette!
- Come back here!
- We've got to save her, Tylo!
- You can't go through that fire!
- We've got to!
- It's too late! We'll be burned up ourselves!
Quick, into the boat!
Oh, Light, will you forgive us?
We shouldn't have gone without you.
You're safe now.
That's all that matters.
We've been rowing all night.
Lightning struck.
The whole forest went up in flames.
Yes, Lightning and Fire are my stepbrothers.
They can be very wicked.
- We nearly got burned up.
- Tylette did get burned up.
She got what she deserved.
Oh, don't say that, Tylo.
Poor Tylette.
There, dear. Don't be unhappy.
What about the blue bird?
We didn't see one. Not one.
We didn't have time to look.
If you ask me, there isn’t no such bird.
Oh, there is, Tylo. There must be.
Of course there is.
You haven't looked everywhere.
There's still the Kingdom of the Future.
- The future?
- Why, yes.
- So many wonderful things are in the future.
- Not me.
I've seen enough wonderful things.
- Oh, please, Tylo.
- You've got to come with us, Tylo.
Sorry. All I can see in the future for me is aching bunions.
- Then will you wait for us?
- Gladly. And take your time.
Come. We'd better get started.
- Is the future far?
- No, just over the hill.
Keep climbing up and up as far as you can go.
Can't you come with us this time?
You won't need me.
When you're ready to leave,
I'll come for you.
Did you ever see so many children?
You don't suppose they're all one family?
Look! Live children!
Look at the live children!
- Why do they call us ''live children''?
- I don't know.
Let's go talk to them.
You're live children, aren't you?
- Of course we're alive. Aren't you?
- Oh, no.
Not yet. We're waiting to be born.
How funny you're dressed!
I was thinking the same about you.
- What are those things on your feet?
- They're my shoes.
Shoes?
What are they for?
They're to protect your feet from thorns and stones and from the cold.
It's all very confusing, but I suppose we'll understand it when we're born.
- Why don't you get born?
- Oh, we will, but we have to wait our turn.
I'll be born in three years.
- I'm going to be born to a throne.
- Is it nice on Earth?
- Oh, yes. It's all right.
- It's beautiful.
Mytyl.| Oh, Mytyl!
- Mytyl!
- Hello.
- You're Mytyl and Tyltyl.
- How do you know our names?
That's not very surprising.
I'm going to be your little sister.
- What?
- Our sister?
Oh! You're coming to live with us.
- Yes.
- When?
Well, I don't know just when.
In a year perhaps.
- That's wonderful.
- Yes, in a way.
''In a way''? There'll be three of us.
We'll have lots of fun.
- Not for very long.
- Why, not?
I'll only be with you a little while.
And then you're going away?
- Yes.
- Oh.
- It's hardly worthwhile you coming at all, is it?
- Shh!
It would seem so, but we can't pick and choose.
What are they doing?
- They are working.
- Working at what?
Oh, all kinds of things.
Go and see, if you like.
They won't mind.
Oh, it's been wonderful seeing you.
- Good-bye, little sister.
- Good-bye.
I'll tell Mummy you're coming.
Would you like to see my discovery?
- Oh, yes.
- What is it?
It doesn't look like much, I know, but it will save a lot of suffering.
- How?
- It will put people to sleep when they're in pain.
Suppose you broke your arm.
This will put you to sleep while they fix it.
And I wouldn't feel anything? No pain?
How could you?
You'd be fast asleep.
It'll be very helpful, don't you think?
Oh, yes. Do hurry and get yourself born.
I will... soon.
Hello.
Hello.
Why are you so sad?
I was just thinking.
I'm going to Earth very soon now.
Almost any day.
- Don't you want to go?
- No, I'm afraid not.
You'll like it once you get there.
There's too much unhappiness.
Up here we are all free.
But we aren't born free, are we?
- Aren't we?
- Some are, perhaps.
But so many are born into slavery and greed... and injustice and cruelty.
That's what I'm going to fight.
I must tty to make them see that people must be the same on
Earth as they are up here- free, equal and united.
Then I should think you'd want to go.
No. They won't listen.
But they will.
You must make them listen.
They'll destroy me.
##[ Fanfare }
What's that?
That's Time. This is the hour when the children who are born today go down to Earth.
- How do they get down? Are there ladders?
- You'll see.
- A ship.
- With silver sails.
- Aldrich.
- [ Boy, } Here.|
Allison.
- Allison!
- Come along, Allison.
- Heer.|
- Arnheim.
- Heer.|
- Armitage.
Armitage!
Baxter.
- Heer!
- Burning.
Burning, that's you!
Good-bye, everybody.
Don't give up your ideas.
Keep on working.
- You'll be coming to Earth soon.
- Good-bye!
Carter. Castle.
- Why are you crying?
- Because I'm afraid.
What of? What's the matter?
I'm afraid they won't call my name.
You mean you want to go?
Oh, yes. I've wanted to go for so long.
- But Mama and Papa haven't time for me.
- Don't they want you?
I'm sure they would if they knew how happy we could all be.
Danfield. Deering.
That's me! He just called my name!
- That's me! That's me!
- You see?
They do want you. Go on now.
Go on. Hurry.
Go right along. Go along.
- My name is Deering.
- I know. Go right along.
Eggert.
Evans and Evans.
Evans and Evans.|
- Here!
- Here!
Elam. Everett.
Finklehoff.
All right. Run right along, right along.
Here, here, here. You can't deceive me.
Go back. It's not your turn.
You too, young man.
They didn't call your name.
Go back! Go back!
Faulkner.
- Ferguson.
- What? More salesmen?
There are too many already.
We're having complaints.
- Well, run along, run along.
- Flanagan.
- Where are the engineers?
Oh, there you are.
- Frobischer.
Hammond.
Humboldt.
Here, here, here, here! No, you don't.
Come here, come here.
This is the third time you've tried to be born before your time.
Don't you let me catch you at it again.
Now go along. Go along!
Your name was called. Come along.
You heard me. Come along.
What's the trouble here?
You're holding us up.
Please. Let me stay behind with her.
- Can't I go with him?
- Impossible.
- I'd rather not be born then.
- You cannot choose.
Please. We love each other, and I shall be born too late.
I will be gone before she comes down.
- I shall never see him again.
- That is no concern of mine.
Don't you understand?
We shall be alone in the world.
- I unite and part as I'm told. Come.
- Oh, no!
I won't be born! I won't!
Oh, leave him with me.
Leave him, please.
Come, come. He's not going to die, but to live.
I shall be the saddest thing on Earth.
I shall love you always.
Come.
No! No!
No!
Come along.
Your name was called. Come along.
Come along. Come along there.
Come along.
Good luck.
Wayne.
- Young.
- Here.|
- Zimmerman.
- Come along, Zimmerman. Come along.
That is all for today.
- We're going!
- We're going!
Bye!
Who's that singing now?
Those are the voices of their mothers coming out to meet them.
Hurry, Mytyl!
I want to see Mummy and Daddy.
I can't wait to tell them all the places we've been.
But the blue bird-What do we do?
What do we say to Faity Betylune?
Tell her the truth.
We went everyplace she said- looked everywhere.
That's what you must tell her.
You've done your best.
Maybe there isn't any blue bird.
That's what I've been saying ever since we started.
You'd better go in now.
Aren't you coming in too, so you can help us explain?
No, dear. I have many places to go.
Won't we see you anymore?
Of course you will.
I'll always be with you.
Not as you see me now... but you will know me.
I'll be in every moonbeam, in every star that shines... in every dawn that rises... and every lamp that's lit... in every good and bright thought of your soul.
You understand, don't you?
Yes, I think so.
Good-bye then, until we meet again.
- Good-bye.
- Bye.
Wake up! Wake up, Mytyl and Tyltyl, you sleepy, heads.
Wake up!
I declare, you'd sleep the clock around if I let you.
Mummy. Oh, Mummy!
It's Mummy, Tyltyl!
- Mummy! We're home!
- It is you!
Well, of course it's me.
Who did you think it was?
- Oh, I'm so glad, Mummy.
- What's the matter with you children?
- It's so good to see you again.
- It's been such a long time.
What nonsense.
You've been dreaming.
- Come, get dressed.
- It wasn't a dream.
We saw Granny and Grandpa, didn't we, Tyltyl?
Yes, and Grandpa's still carving those little whistlers.
What are you children talking about?
And Granny's just the same as she was.
- Exactly,.
- What's this noise about?
Daddy!
Oh, Daddy, it's so good to see you.
There's something wrong with these children.
They must have eaten something last night that didn't agree with them.
- They look all right to me.
- They're talking such nonsense about seeing their grandparents.
- We did, Daddy. We really did.
- But we're home now.
And we missed you so.
You mean you're going to miss me when I go to war.
Oh, I forgot.
- Who's that now?
- I'll go.
Hop into your clothes now, both of you.
Hurry up.
Wilhelm. But you said we were to assemble at noon at the village square.
That's right, we were.
But now you can spen
 your Christmas at home.
- What? What happened?
- A truce was declared last night.
- A truce?
- The treaty is being signed today.
- Oh, praise God!
- A stroke of the pen is better than a stroke of the sword, no?
Last night I felt like a demon coming with such news.
Ah, but this morning you're like Santa Claus.
- With the gift of peace.
- And that's a gift worth having.
They all say that when I tell them.
- Well, good-bye. Merry Christmas!
- Good-bye. Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!
Daddy, is it true?
You don't have to go to war?
- Yes, dear, it's true.
- Isn't it wonderful news?
- Oh, I'm so glad, Daddy.
- We're all glad, dear.
- Me too, Daddy. Me too.
- Good old boy.
Look, even Tylo's trying to tell you how glad he is, Daddy.
- Good old Tylo.
- He was wonderful.
As brave as anything.
He saved us from the fire.
- I tell you, there is something wrong with them.
- What's that about a fire?
The forest. The trees were all burned up.
So was Tylette.
Oh, the poor thing.
Well, she seems to have a very good appetite this morning.
But she lost her life in the fire.
- We couldn't save her.
- Is that so?
Well, cats do have nine lives.
- Maybe she has eight to go.
- That explains it.
She was awfully mean to us... wasn't she, Tylo?
Sic her, Tylo! Sic her!
Come along. Get to the table.
Your breakfast's all ready.
Oh, Mummy, everything’s so wonderful, isn't it?
So bright and shiny and beautiful.
Is it? Why, it's just the same as it's always been.
Oh, no. It's different.
Quite different.
Your Daddy got up at daybreak to make a cage for your bird.
Do you like it?
Tyltyl, look!
My bird! Look what's happened to it.
It was brown when we caught it, and now it's changed.
It's blue. It's the blue bird!
- The blue bird?
- Blue bird?
Yes. We looked everywhere for it. Everywhere.
And all the time it was right here.
- Where are you going?
- I'll be right back.
What's come over the child?
I've never seen her so.
Oh, she's just happy, that's all.
- It's hard to catch, isn't it?
- Angela!
You're up! You're walking!
Yes, Mother. Look, it's Mytyl's bird.
She's given it to me.
It's a blue bird, Mrs. Berlingot.
Oh, Angela, I can't believe it.
Mytyl, it's a miracle.
I must run and tell your father.
- Can I hold him now?
- Yes, in a minute.
Hold him gently now. Gently.
Oh, he's so soft and warm.
Do you suppose he's-
Oh, it's gone!
Oh, Mytyl!
I was so happy, and now it's gone!
Don't worry, Angela.
We'll find it again.
Oh, we can't. We can't ever.
Oh, yes, we can. I know we can.
But how do you know?
Are you sure, Mytyl?
Yes, Angela, I'm sure.
Because now we know where to look for it... don't we?
Kinostudio "Soyuzmultifilm"
Moscow, 1947
The Little Humpbacked Horse
Director
I. Vano
Past the woods and mountains steep,
Past the rolling waters deep,
Where the skies black earth behold,
Lived a peasant weak and old.
Of his sons, and he had three
Eldest sharp was as could be.
Second was nor dull nor bright,
But the third, a fool all right.
But, upon an evil day,
Dire misfortune came their way,
Someone, when the day was through
Took to trampling wheat they grew.
Day and night they sat and thought
How the villain could be caught.
Till at last they understood
Nightly guard would do them good.
You, Ivan just go around.
Watch the field and space abound.
We'll lay low and watch this spot,
Soon the loathsome thief be caught!
Stars, stars... one, two, three...
All night long, I count thee
Four, five, six and... there's seven!
Fingers ten can't count all heaven!
If you will set me free,
Two brave stallions I would give thee
And such handsome steeds I'd bear
As have ne'er been seen, I swear.
If you wish, why, sell the two,
But part not with the little steed!
Faithful friend to you he'll be,
Where you go, on land or sea.
So, farewell!
I will roam free...
But not in our field!
Log house, stove… all swing around, ain’t no place for the master to lay down.
Where in this hangover dread,
Shall I hide my rowdy head?
Don’t you worry ‘bout the boot,
Hey, stomp with your foot.
Drunks “knee-deep” all seas shall measure,
But their heads they do not treasure.
Heavens! Look what lovely pair, our young fool has hidden there!
Oh, the field, the field of mine
Roaming free just feels so fine!
Roaming free just feels... Hugh?!
Oh, my horses black as night,
With your golden manes so bright!
Did not I look after you?
What foul devil stole you? Who?
Don’t blame devils for their deeds, your two brothers stole those steeds!
Yes, your loss is great, I know
But I'll help you in your woe.
Mount my back-when I say: 'Go',
Hold to me for all you know!
What a wonder, like a flame!
Look, there's light in plenty here,
But no smoke or heat, I swear!
And you very well may stare!
That's a Fire-Bird's feather there!
But, for your own sake,
Touch it not, for in its wake.
Many sorrows, many woes,
Follow everywhere it goes.
That is not a truth,
I am not such a fool!
Many sorrows, many woes
Follow everywhere it goes.
Honest masters, come this way!
See what wares we have today!
Foxes, ferrets… different furs!
Saddles and some horsewhips sound!
Tawed reins!
Honey cakes!
Spiced brine apples!
Savor all my gingerbreads!
Tsar’s approaching!
Redhead chamberlain ‘side him,
He’s horse keepers’ chief supreme.
What a sight they’re to behold
Just to me, you will be sold!
Who's the owner?
My good people, who...
Owns these handsome chargers two?
Tsar, these steeds belong to me,
I'm their owner, too, you see.
Well, I wish to buy the team.
Would you sell them to me?
No, I'm swapping them.
What will you be taking, then?
Two times five fistfuls of silver.
Two times five...? Ten.
Ten!
Oh, um...
Well...
Shake hands!
Hey, you! Bring the treasury!
Whatcha looking at, old snake?
Take the steeds, for goodness sake!
Oh, brothers, what a show!
I could die just laughing so!
Now, my grooms can't hold those two,
So, there's nothing else to do.
You come and serve to me,
I'll pay with gold to thee!
Make you Master of my Horse,
Like a lord, you'll live, of course.
What a wonder!
Let it be!
I shall serve Your Majesty!
Have I fallen from your grace?
And my job which I embrace?
My displeasure, do observe!
Under Ivan you shall serve!
Take them, Ivan, faithful slave
To my stable, steeds so brave!
Just you wait, you dirty lout,
Time will come, I'll turn you out.
Tsar’s Stables
Servant life is sloth and folly
Chasing pigeons - he is jolly.
Steeds well-fed and clean appear
Could some ghost be working here?
Can it be, a goblin sprite
Comes and braids their manes at night?
Spy on him - that's what I shall do.
And won’t stop until I’m through!
I’ll your silky bangs unbraid
With a fine-toothed comb inlaid
Brush your manes and braid 'em back
And admire your beauty black.
Oh you, skipping horses mine
You are graceful, you are fine!
But the heart perceives most dear
My humpback that’s always near.
This shall be your bitter end,
To the gallows you’ll be sent.
All the Court knows it is true,
What Ivan conceals from you.
Tisn't silver, tisn't gold,
Fire-Bird's feather, Sire…Behold!
And he boasts, as I've heard,
That, did you but say the word,
He could bring the Bird of Fire,
To your Royal Chamber, Sire.
Hey, fetch for me that foolish lad!
Won’t escape my fist-too bad!
By what law and what decree
Have you from Our Majesty
Hidden what is ours by right?
Yes, the Fire-Bird's feather bright?
Pardon me this once, please do
And I'll lie no more to you.
You'll be pardoned for the nonce,
Seeing you have sinned but once.
You have boasted, as I've heard,
That, did I but say the word,
You could bring the Bird of Fire
To the Chamber of your Sire.
May the lightning strike my head if such thing I ever said!
If you do not bring the Bird of Fire,
To my Royal Chamber, now,
By my Royal Beard I vow,
I will find you anywhere!
I'll destroy you! Get out!
Slave!
Yes, cry now!
You rejected my advice, now, you have to pay the price.
Oh, whatever shall I do?
Help me, oh my friend so true.
It is not an easy deed, but together we'll succeed!
So, listen to me well!
Telling you in language plain,
We will need the best of grain,
And two troughs; then, if you please,
Wine, brought in from overseas.
Really, we’ve no time to waste.
And at dawn we must make haste.
Ivan’s gone long time from here.
Somewhere lies he drunk, I fear.
Let you down this time, I think,
Broke decrees and did not blink.
Were he empty-handed to arrive
I would have to skin the fool alive.
I am twisting little rope
Lovingly, kid’s noose I grope
He shall test the strength of threads.
Soon, I’ll finish with my noose
Insult’s gone when he’ll hang loose.
Vile hound, snout of swine!
May you bow-like twist your spine!
May you choke on birch bark shoe!
May you fall the black earth through!
What have you brought back for me?
Show me! Patience’s not my trait.
Father Tsar, a moment’s wait!
Shut the chamber casement tight,
Draw the shades, keep out the light.
Hey, boyars! You should make haste need day with night replaced!
Oh how lively you do leap
Come enjoy your peaceful keep!
Vanya, friend, I love you so,
Lightened is my heart, you know.
And, in token of my joy,
Be my Royal Groom, my boy!
You won't always prosper so,
Have such foolish luck, oh no!
I'll get you in trouble, yet!
Yes, I will, my little pet!
In a distant German lands,
Flows an ocean, like no others;
And it washes foreign shores,
And it's sailed by merchant moors.
Sailors tell about a maiden fair,
Living on that ocean there.
She's no common maiden, see
Daughter to the Sun is she,
Moon’s her brother, goes the word
Scarlet dress she wears...
I'll get you in trouble, yet!
Yes, I will, my little pet!
SAUNA
Get him, get him get him clean
Front and back and in between
Birch twig switch of leafy green
One, two-water off duck’s back is dripping
Good health comes from all this whipping.
And will be our Father mild
Rosy red like tender child
From the waters boiling wild.
One, two-water off duck’s back is dripping
Good health comes from all this whipping.
One, two-water off duck’s back is dripping
Good health comes from all this whipping.
Tsar, your Vanya gaily said,
Swearing by your Royal Head,
That he knew this birdie -yes-
So he called her, I confess.
And, O Sire, it's also true
That he bragged to catch her, too.
I have been informed, dear Vanya,
That just now, my lad, you said,
Swearing by my Royal Head,
That, did I but say the word,
You could bring another bird.
For your Monarch, you did swear, you could catch the Tsar-Maid Fair.
My Tsar, that's not true.
Someone has been lying to you.
What! You don't want to obey?
Listen to me, my lad...
If you do not bring to me
That Tsar-Maid, in short weeks three,
To my Chamber, lovely bird,
Mark, Ivan, my royal word,
You’ll be pulled apart in pieces!
In this lovely silky tent
I my loneliness lament
And for no-one my voice sings
As I nod and pluck my strings.
Oh dear Tsar, it’s time to sing
Since Tsar-Maiden he won’t bring
Serf has played another trick
Drive him in a coffin thick.
Peerless, beautiful princess,
Be my bride! Agree - say yes!
Oh! Your lovely eyes so bright
They will haunt me day and night!
They will torture me by day,
And at nights, drive sleep away!
Say but one sweet word to me
Everything is ready, see.
And tomorrow, oh my life,
We'll be wedded man and wife.
I will never marry you!
Old man and toothless, too!
I may be old, yet I’m lively and I’m bold.
I would marry you only if you're still young.
But I love you more than life!
Why can you not be my wife?
You regain your youth anew,
And I'll gladly marry you.
Listen, early in the morn,
On the palace court-yard lawn,
You must have put on three cauldrons ready,
Two-on fires burning steady.
Now, the first one must be filled
To the brim, with water chilled,
While the next - with water hot.
Then, with milk fill up the last,
Heat it, till the milk boils fast.
If you want to marry me,
Young and handsome wish to be,
First you must your robes divest,
Plunge into the milk, undressed.
Next, in boiling water. Then,
In the water cold - and when
You emerge - Oh, Father my,
You’ll be young and handsome guy.
Oh, dear Father, don’t get sad,
Try this trick on our lad.
Cauldrons' magic he should test
If it works, then be my guest.
Tomorrow morn, on the palace court-yard lawn,
You, Ivan, must do your best
These three cauldrons you must test.
First bathe in the milk, my son,
Then the waters, one by one.
But I'll be boiled alive!
Chickens, pigs, and turkeys -yes-
People scald them, I confess.
I could bath in cold water, yeah, but in boiling water - no way!
What? You defy to me?
Put him under lock and key!
Talk like this, you getting then
Bread and water regimen!
First you do the cauldron bit
Then we’ll talk about it.
If we only never met.
Woes to you, I do regret.
Tsar will be the death of me.
He’ll be boiling me, you see.
God bless you and do not cry.
We will manage, you and I.
I would sooner perish, than leave you in the lurch, Ivan.
Say to Tsar: Your Gracious Majesty!
Please to send my horse to me,
So that I can say good-bye
To my horse before I die.
Tsar will agree, you'll see.
Now, sleep in peace and forget your cares.
Now, undress yourself, my man
Try the cauldrons best you can.
Oh, allow Your Majesty,
Please to send my horse to me
So that I can say good-bye before I die.
If the milk doesn't boil proper, water one will be his stopper.
Why are you just staying still?
Wait’s been long, now do my will!

-THE END-
Through the snow and sleet and hail... through the blizzard, through the gale... through the wind and through the rain... over mountain, over plain... through the blinding lightning flash... and the mighty thunder crash... ever faithful, ever true... nothing stops him.
He'll get through.
Look out for Mr Stork that persevering chap
He'll come along and drop a bundle in your lap
You may be poor or rich
It doesn't matter which
Millionaires, they get theirs like the butcher and the baker
So look out for Mr Stork and let me tell you, friend
Don't try to get away
He'll find you in the end
He'll spot you out in China or he'll fly to County Cork
So you'd better look out for Mr Stork
Look out for Mr Stork
He's got you on his list
And when he comes around it's useless to resist
Remember those quintuplets and the woman in the shoe
Maybe he's got his eye on you
All aboard! All aboard!
All aboard! Let's go!

Oh, he is a darling little baby.
Adorable. Simply adorable.
Did you ever see anything so cunning?
Isn't he a darling!
Kootchy, kootchy, kootchy, kootchy, kootchy, kootchy.

- Isn't there some mistake?
Just look at those, those...
E-A-R-S.
Those what? Oh, ears!
These! Aren't they funny? Oh!
- Oh, my goodness.
- What a temper.
Oh, what did I do?
Well, tell me.
- Did I say anything?
- Perfectly harmless remark.
I just said that they're funny, and they are funny.
- They certainly are.
- After all, who cares... about her precious little Jumbo?
Jumbo? You mean Dumbo.
Dumbo.
- Dumbo, I say.
- That's good.
- Dumbo! That's good.
- Dumbo.
I think I can. I think I can.
I think I can. I think I can.
I think I can. I think I can.
I think I can.
I thought I could. I thought I could.
I thought I could. I thought I could.
Whoo-woo!
Hike, ugh, hike, ugh hike, ugh, hike
We work all day
We work all night
We never learned to read or write
We're happy-hearted roustabouts
Hike, ugh, hike, ugh hike, ugh, hike
When other folks have gone to bed
We slave until we're almost dead
We're happy-hearted roustabouts
Hike, ugh, hike, ugh hike, ugh, hike
We don't know when we get our pay
And when we do we throw our pay away
When we get our pay we throw our money all away
We get our pay when children say
With happy hearts
It's circus day today
Then we get our pay just watching kids on circus day
Muscles aching
Back near breaking
Eggs and bacon's what we need
- Yes, sir!
- Boss man houndin'
Keep on poundin'
For your bread and keep

But must keep awake
Hep! Heave! Hep! Heave!
Hep! Heave! Hep! Heave!
Hep! Heave! Hep! Heave!
Hep! Heave! Hep!
Swing that sledge

Pullin', poundin' tyin', groundin'
Big top roundin'into shape
Keep on workin'
Stop that shirkin'
Grab that rope, you hairy ape
Poundin', poundin'
Poundin', poundin'
Oh
Jostling and juggling.
Fifteen minutes!
Step right up and get your tickets.
Hurry, hurry now.
Hurry to the big sideshow.
That's why you go under the big top.
Fifteen big attractions that you can't see anywhere else in the world!
The greatest collection in the entire world.
And the greatest comedies are featured and assembled for your entertainment.
Ain't that the funniest thing you ever saw? Look at his ears.
Hey, guys, lookit!
Smitty's an elephant!
- Aw, let me see!
- Boo!
- You can't hide him from us.
- Yeah, his ears are still stickin' out.
- Come on!
- We wanna see him!
- We wanna laugh.
- Sure, that's what we came for.
Hey, the biggest slingshot in the world.
- Hey! Cut that out!
- Hey, let's get out of here.
- You're hurting me! Help!
- Here, you! What's going on?
Down. Mrs Jumbo, down!
Surround her. Tie her down.
Get down!
Calm down! Tie her down!
Darling, it was so funny.
Oh, my dear, can you bear it?
When she doused the ringmaster,
I just thought I'd die.
Well, personally, I think she went a bit too far.
After all, one mustn't forget one is a lady.
- Oh, you're right, dear. Yes.
- Oh, that's very true.
Oh, well, I suppose that's mother love.
But it's certainly no excuse for what she did.
Mother love might cover a multitude of sins.
It's true, my dear, and she has such a streak in...
A guy can't eat in peace.
Yes, but mother love does...
Gab, gab, gab.
Always gossipin'.
Girls, girls! Listen!
Have I got a trunk full of dirt.
- Well, darling, tell us all.
- Go on, go on.
Well, I heard today that they have put her in solitary confinement.
- No!
- You don't mean it!
Oh, how awful for her!
Well, I-I must say,
I-I don't blame her for anything.
You're absolutely right.
It's all the fault of that little...
F-R-E-A-K.
Yes, him with those ears that only a mother could love.
What's the matter with his ears?
I don't see nothin' wrong with 'em.
I think they're cute.
Ladies, ladies!
It's no laughing matter at all.
Oh. Oh, she's right, girls.
Don't forget that we elephants have always walked with dignity.
His disgrace is our own shame.
- Yes, that's true. That's very true.
- Oh, indeed it is.
Well, frankly, I wouldn't eat at the same bale of hay with him.
- No. Right.
- Me either, dearie.
- I should say.
- Nor I. That's just how I feel about it.
Here he comes now.
Hmm. Pretend you don't see him.
Shh.
How do ya like that?
Givin' him the cold shoulder.
Poor little guy.
There he goes, without a friend in the world.
Nobody to turn to.
Oh, I'll do somethin' about this.
A mouse!
So ya like to pick on little guys, huh?
Well, why don't you pick on me?
A proud race.
Overstuffed hay bags!
Boo!
Still afraid of a mouse.
Ho-ho, boy.
Wait'll I tell the little guy.
Where is he? Oh. Hey, Dumbo.
You can come out now.
Golly. Maybe I scared him too.
Look, Dumbo. I'm your friend.
Come on out, won't ya?
You're not really afraid of little me, are ya?
Ya are?
Must've overdid it in there.
Don't know my own strength sometimes.
Dumbo. Look what I got for ya.
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
Ya gotta come out first.
Too bad ya don't trust me,
'cause I thought... uh, well, you... you and me, uh, we might get your mother out of the clink.
Oh, but I guess you wouldn't be interested. So long, Dumbo.
Well, that's more like it.
Ya know, your ma ain't crazy.
She's just broken-hearted.
It ain't nobody's fault you got them big ears.
Uh-oh. Boy, I stepped in it that time.
Aw, gee, Dumbo.
I think your ears are beautiful.
Sure. As a matter of fact,
I think they're very decorative.
You know, lots of people with big ears are famous.
Ho-ho, boy.
All we gotta do is build an act.
Make ya a star. A headliner!
Dumbo the Great!
Uh-oh. The great what?
Ya know, Dumbo, we gotta get an idea.
Not just any idea.
Something colossal, like, uh...
Have I got an idea!
What an idea!
Huh. He never had an idea in his life.
Just visualize:
One elephant climbs up... on top of another elephant until finally... all 17 elephants... have constructed an enormous pyramid... of pachyderms.
I step out.
I blow the whistle.
- Yeah.
- The trumpets are trumpeting.
- Yeah.
- And now... comes the climax!
Yeah? What is the climax?
Hmm. I don't know.
I knew he never had nothin'.
Well, maybe it comes to me... in a vision while I dream.
- Good night, Joe.
- Good night, Boss.
Climax.
Climax! Dumbo, you're a climax.
I'll be back in a minute.
I'm gonna take care of your future.
I am the voice of your subconscious mind.
Your inspiration.
Now, concentrate.
Remember?
Your pyramid of elephants... are standing in the ring waitin' for a climax.
- Climax.
- You are now getting that climax.
- Climax.
- How's the reception?
Comin' through okay? Good.
Suddenly, from the sidelines, comes your climax.
- Climax.
- Gallopin' across the arena.
- Arena.
- He jumps from a springboard... to a platform.
At the very pinnacle of your pyramid, he waves a flag... for a glorious finish!
- Finish?
- And who is your climax?
The little elephant with the big ears!
The world's mightiest midget mastodon! Dumbo!
What?
- Dumbo.
- Dumbo.
- Dumbo.
- Dumbo.
- Dumbo.
- Dumbo.
I got it! I got it!
Ladies and gentlemen... we will now present for your entertainment... the most stupendous, magnificent... super-colossal spectacle.
On this tiny... little, insignificant ball... we will construct for you... a pyramid, not of wood, not of stone...
To hear him talk, you'd think he was going to do it.
- But a living, breathing...
- The stuffed shirt.
Pyramid of ponderous, pulsating... pulchritudinous pachyderms!
I give you the elephants.
Aren't we a bit clumsy?
Gaining a little weight, aren't you, honey?
You're no cream puff yourself, dearie.
Quiet up there.
Tend to your work, girls.
Take your foot out of my eye, clumsy ox.
Steady, girls.
Boy, that was a close one.
They're almost ready now, Dumbo.
Don't forget to wave that flag.
Okay, okay.
Don't wave it no more. I saw ya.
Now, look. All ya gotta do is run out, see?
Jump on the springboard.
All right, now show me just how you're gonna do it.
That's it. Attaboy.
That's the stuff. Come on.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! Dumbo!
Oh, those ears.
We gotta do somethin', quick.
Ladies and gentlemen... you have now seen the impossible... accomplished in front of your faces.
Seven jungle giants... each one weighing not...
That windbag!
- Why doesn't he come to the point?
- 7,500 pounds!
And now, I present... the world's smallest little elephant... who will spring from this springboard... in one spring... to the top of this pyramid, waving his little flag... for a grand climax!
Ladies and gentlemen...
I give you Dumbo!
Go on! Get goin'!
What's the matter with you?
Dumbo! That's your cue!
You're on, Dumbo.
Out of my way, assassin!
- Dear!
- Ohh.
I never thought I'd live to see the big top fall.
Because of that Dumbo,
I never can show my face there again.
Oh, look at my beautiful tail!
I'd just like to spank the daylights out of him...
Ah! Oh! Oh! Ohh.
Oh, that won't be necessary, dearie.
They fixed him good.
- What do you mean?
- Wh-What did they do?
- Did they beat him?
- What is it, darling?
- Tell us.
- Come, come. I demand to know.
Oh. Well, they've gone and made him...
- Oh, dear, I just can't say it.
- Out with it!
Made him a clown.
A clown?
- No!
- Yes.
Oh, the shame of it.
Let us take the solemn vow.
From now on, he is no longer... an elephant.
Please! Help me save my poor baby!
Whoo! Save my child!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Where are you? Yoo-hoo!
Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Save my ba...
- Come on! Jump!
- We'll save you. Hurry up!
- Hurry up!
- We'll save you. Go on.
- Jump!
- We'll save ya.
Whew! Boy, oh, boy, did we wow 'em out there!
- What a performance!
- Are we good?
Thirteen curtain calls.
Thirteen!
Yeah, sure brought down the house, all right.
Oh, Mama, did we panic 'em.
Ask me, Joey. Go ahead. Ask me.
You said it.
We rolled 'em in the aisles.
- Boy, oh, boy, what a act.
- Oh, "what a act" is right.
Stupendous, I calls it.
They'll have more respect for us clowns now.
- Yeah, yeah, you bet.
- Here, boys.
This calls for a real celebration.
Come and get it.
- Poison! Am I thirsty.
- I could use one of them myself.
- This one's on Dumbo.
- Yeah, Dumbo.
- Dumbo!
- Here's plaster in his eyes.
See? They're drinkin' a toast to ya.
Yeah. You're a big hit.
Why, uh, you're terrific.
Oh, you're colossal. Stupendous.
Come on. Alley-oop.
I gotta wash behind your ears.
You oughta be proud.
You're a success.
Look. A peanut!
Come on. Eat it.
Got lots of vitamins.
Give ya a lot of, uh, pep.
Oh-ho-ho.
I forgot to tell ya.
Why, we're goin' over to see your mother.
I made an appointment for ya.
Didn't I tell ya? Huh!
Just like me. I must have forgot.
Come on. Get your hat.
Oh. Right over there.
Cosy little place, ain't it?
Mrs Jumbo. I hope she's in.
Someone to see ya.
Baby mine
Don't you cry
Baby mine
Dry your eyes
Rest your head
Close to my heart
Never to part
Baby of mine
Little one
When you play
Don't you mind
What they say
Let those eyes
Sparkle and shine
Never a tear
Baby of mine
From your head
To your toes
Baby mine
You're so sweet goodness knows
Baby mine
- You are so
- Baby, baby, baby
- Precious to me
- Mine
Cute as can be baby of mine
Baby mine
Baby mine
Here ya are.
Pour it in me slipper, Joey.
Boy, I can't get over the way we rolled 'em in the aisles.
- Just wait'll we hit the big town.
- This gives me an idea.
Let's raise the platform the elephant jumps off of.
Yeah! If they laugh when he jumps 20 feet... they'll laugh twice as hard if he jumps 40 feet.
- Yeah, that's right. That's right.
- Simple mathematics.
- Let's make it 80 feet.
- Don't be a piker. 180.
- Make it 300.
- A thousand.
- Yeah, that's good.
- Hey, be careful.
- You'll hurt the little guy.
- Aw, go on.
- Elephants ain't got no feelings.
- No, they're made of rubber.
This idea is sensational.
Let's go tell the boss.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Come on. Let's go.
Hey, hey!
Let's hit him for a raise.
Yeah, sure.
This is worth real dough.
Oh, we're gonna hit the big boss for a raise
Yes, we're gonna hit the big boss for a raise
Oh, we're gonna get more money
'cause we know that we're funny
We're gonna hit the big boss for a raise
I know how ya feel, Dumbo, but you gotta pull yourself together.
What would your mother think of ya, if she saw you crying like this?
Remember, you come of a proud race.
Why you're a-a-a... a pachyderm... and pachyderms don't cry.
What's cryin' get ya anyhow?
Nothin' but the hiccups.
There. Ya see?
Well, ain't nothin' a little water won't cure.
Oops-a-daisy. We'll have ya fixed up in a jiffy.
Come on.
Here. Take a trunk full.
Listen, little fella.
We may have had a lot of hard luck up till now... but you and me is gonna do big things together.
Hold your breath. Why, your mother's gonna be so proud of ya.
I'm gonna be proud of ya too.
The whole circus is gonna be proud of ya. Now, what do ya think of that?
Swallow it.
Ho-ho. They can't keep us down.
Oh, I guess you had one little one left over.
Dumbo, we'll bounce back so ha...
Hey, what's the matter with you?
What kind of water is this, anyhow?
Balloonies.
Hiya, George.
Whee!
That's a pretty schstrick schlick.
All right. Let's see ya blow a square one, pal.
Say, that's very, very clever.
Now blow a great big one.
That's a pretty sh... Hey!
Dumbo.
You see what I see?
Look out, look out
Pink elephants on parade
Here they come
Hippity-hoppity
They're here and there
Pink elephants everywhere
Look out, look out
They're walking around the bed on their head
Clippity-cloppity
Arrayed in braid
Pink elephants on parade
- What'll I do
- What'll I do
What an unusual view
I can stand the sight of worms and look at microscopic germs
But Technicolour pachyderms is really too much for me
I am not the type to faint
When things are odd or things are quaint
But seein'things you know there ain't
Can certainly give you an awful fright
What a sight
Chase 'em away, chase 'em away
I'm afraid, need your aid
Pink elephants on parade
- Hey, hey, hey
- Pink elephants
Pink elephants
Pink elephants
- Well, looky here, looky here.
- My, my.
Why, this is most irregular.
Well, I just can't believe my eyes.
- They ain't dead, is they?
- No. Dead people don't snore.
Or do they?
Uh, wh-what's all the ruckus?
Come on.
Step aside, brother.
Uh, what's cookin' 'round here?
What's the good news?
What's fryin', boy?
- Just look down there, brother.
- And prepare yourself for a shock.
- Well, hush my beak!
- Go ahead. Wake 'em up, brother.
Yeah. Find out what they're doin' up here.
- Yeah.
- And "ax" them what they want.
Okay, boys. Leave it to me.
Ohh! Those pink elephants.
Ho! Pink elephants? Mm-mmm!
What's so funny? What are you boys doin' down here, anyway?
What are we doin' down here?
Well, hear him talk.
Go on.
Fly up a tree where you belong.
- Say, look here, Brother Rat.
- Brother Rat?
Now listen. I ain't your brother and I ain't no rat, see?
Uh-huh. And I suppose you... and no elephant ain't up in no tree, either.
No! No, me and no tree ain't up no... Huh?
Tree?
Yo!
Dumbo.
Dumbo. Wake up.
Wake up, Dumbo!
Don't look now, but I think we're up in a tree.
Aw, don't pay no attention to them scarecrows.
Come on, Dumbo.
Let's get back to the circus.
So long, boy!
But I wonder how we ever got up in that tree, anyway.
Now, let's see.
Elephants can't climb trees, can they?
Nah, nah, that's ridiculous.
Couldn't jump up.
Mm-mm. It's too high.
Hey there, son.
Maybe you all flew up.
Maybe we flew up.
Yeah, maybe we...
That's it! Dumbo! You flew!
Boy, am I stupid.
Why didn't I think of this before?
Your ears. Just look at 'em, Dumbo.
Why, they're perfect wings.
The very things that held ya down are gonna carry ya up and up and up!
I can see it all now.
Dumbo, the Ninth Wonder of the Universe!
The world's only flyin' elephant!
Did you ever see an elephant fly?
- Well, I've seen a horsefly.
- Ah, I've seen a dragonfly.
- Hee-hee. I've seen a housefly.
- Yeah!
See, I've seen all that too.
I've seen a peanut stand and heard a rubber band.
I seen a needle that winked its eye.
But I be done seen about ever'thing
When I see a elephant fly
- What'd you say, boy?
- I said when I see a elephant fly
I seen a front porch swing heard a diamond ring
I seen a polka-dot railroad tie
But I be done seen
'bout ever'thing
When I see a elephant fly
- Da da-da-da
- Da-da-da do-do-dow wow
- Da da-da-da
- Hey, wow
I saw a clotheshorse
He rear up and buck
And they tell me that a man made a vegetable truck
I didn't see that
I only heard
Just to be sociable
I'll take your word
- I heard a fireside chat
- I saw a baseball bat
And I just laughed till I thought I'd die
But I be done seen
'bout ever'thing
When I see a elephant fly
Bo Sho Ba-da-do-do
But I be done seen
'bout ever'thing
When I see a elephant fly
With the wind.
When I see a elephant
Fly
All right, you wise birds.
This has gone far enough.
Quiet, gentlemen.
The Reverend Rodent is gonna address you.
You oughta be ashamed of yourselves.
A bunch of big guys like you... pickin' on a poor little orphan like him.
Suppose you was torn away from your mother when you was just a baby... nobody to tuck you in at nights... no warm, soft, caressin' trunk to snuzzle into.
How would you like to be left out alone... in a cold, cruel, heartless world?
And why? I ask ya, why?
Just because he's got those big ears, they call him a freak.
The laughing stock of the circus.
Then when his mother tried to protect him... they threw her into the clink.
And on top of that, they made him a clown!
Socially, he's washed up.
Ah, but what's the use of talkin' to you cold-hearted birds?
Go ahead. Have your fun.
Laugh at him.
Kick him, now that he's down.
Go on!
We don't care.
Come on, Dumbo.
Hey, brother, w-w-wait a minute.
Uh, don't go away feelin' like that.
We done seen the light.
You boys is okay.
Please, you've done enough.
Well, but we's all fixin' to help you.
Uh, ain't that the truth, boys?
- Well, it sure is.
- Uh, yeah, that... You're right.
You wanna make the elephant fly, don't ya?
Well, you gotta use a lot of'chology.
You know, psychology.
Now, here's what you do.
First, you, uh...
Uh, bu...
And then, right after that, you, uh...
Use the magic feather.
Catch on?
The magic feather?
Yeah, I gotcha.
Dumbo! Look! Have I got it!
The magic feather!
Now you can fly!
Let's go. Let's go.
- Heave ho. Heave ho.
- Let's go, Dumbo.
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Come on now.
- Up, down. Up, down.
- Heave ho.
- One, two, One, two. One, two.
- Heave ho.
Faster, faster.
Get up flyin' speed.
Retract your landing gear.
Raise your fuselage.
Take off.
Aw, it's no use, Dumbo.
I guess it's just another one of their... Look!
Hot diggity! You're flyin'.
You're flyin'!
Uh, why, he flies just like a eagle.
That's better than a aeroplane.
Brother, now I've seen everything.
But I be done seen about everything
When I see a elephant fly
With the wind.
When I see a elephant
Fly
Dumbo, I knew you could do it!
Wait'll we get to the big town.

Poor baby! Whoo!

- Come on! Jump!

Dumbo, you're standing on the threshold of success.
Don't look down.
It'll make you dizzy.
Boy, are they in for a surprise.
Ho-ho.
Got the magic feather? Good.
Okay. Contact!
Take off!
Uh-oh. The magic feather!
Dumbo, come on. Fly.
Open them ears.
The magic feather was just a gag.
You can fly.
Honest, you can.
Hurry! Open 'em up!
Please!
Whee! We did it! We did it!
Let's show 'em, Dumbo.
Power dive.
Now, loop the loop.
You're makin' history!
I've seen a peanut stand heard a rubber band
I've seen a needle that winked its eye
But I be done seen
About everything
When I see an elephant fly
- Oh, my
- When I see
When I see
When I see an elephant fly
- Mmm, look at him go!
- When I see an elephant fly

- Yippee!
When I see a elephant fly
I wish I'd have got his autograph.
Oh, man, I got his autograph.
Well, so long, glamour boy!

Andrew! Andrew Hardy!
If you're not down to breakfast in 1 minute, I'll come up and get you.
I've been taught never to come to breakfast...
...before doing my morning ablutions.
You know, Mrs. Hardy, cleanliness is close to godliness.
Milly! Milly, come down here, will you? Hurry!
Coming, Emily.
- Why Emily, dear, what's the matter?
- Milly, I think I'm going insane.
Oh, nonsense.
Now what is it, what's wrong?
Well, there you are.
Recipe for a chocolate pudding.
Read that.
Remove the mixture from the icebox, add four eggs and...
Continued on next page, column two.
Pour it down the sink.
- Pour it down the sink?
- Add four eggs and pour it down the sink.
Now, am I insane or not?
Oh, somebody's cut out a picture or something.
And we've been reading
'How to clean clogged drain pipes.'
Well, I thought that was a silly way to make a chocolate pudding.
There's something very funny going on around this house.
Only this morning I found two pages cut out of the Home Fashion Guide.
I'm trying to finish this dress without the pattern.
Maybe some pictures of flowers on the other side and Andy cut them out.
What's happened to that boy?
I've called him twice.
Andrew Hardy, for the third time.
I'm practically there, Mom.
Gee, where's the fire?
- Fire?
- The way you expected me to get dressed...
...and downstairs I figured maybe you thought I was a fireman.
Good morning.
Good morning, Aunt Milly.
Good morning, dear. Oh, Andy, the pins! Did you prick yourself?
I'll get it, Mother.
Andy, how many times have I told you?
Now sit down and wait till I'm ready.
Not this morning. I'm botanizing.
I've got to collect 20 specimens of wild flowers.
On Saturday? Is Mother's little lamb feeling all right?
My dear mother, I'm studying Botany.
It's apparent you've never known what it is to commute with nature.
Commune with nature.
Andy, stop eating that donut.
Botanically speaking, this isn't eating.
This is osmosis.
As in plants, so in human beings.
Eating is just osmosis on a larger scale.
Now take Dianthus careophyllus or Rubus idaeus...
What kind of language is that for a nice boy to use?
It's all right, Mom, it just means raspberries.
Polly Benedict's father on the phone.
He wants Dad to meet him at orphan's home positively before 1 o'clock.
Oh, dear, and your father's gone fishing.
Calm yourselves, ladies,
I'll get the message...
...to the good Judge Hardy while doing my botanizing.
I know his favorite place to fish.
And if you hurry, maybe you can find him before he catches anything.
Then we won't have to have fish for dinner.
- All right, Mom.
- Let's see your Botany specimens...
...maybe I can help you classify them.
Marian, Marian, would you have me cheat?
Why, do you know that it's dishonorable for a student to accept help?
Andy! Andy!
Oh, that boy!
Now he's gone without his breakfast.
Don't worry, Mother.
Nature feeds its own.
Don't be silly.
Andy can't eat wild flowers.
Of course, Daphne, there's no chance of me ever meeting you.
But oh, boy. They can't put you in jail for dreaming.
Well... what are you doing here?
I was looking for you, Dad.
In the back of a log?
No, sir.
I'm collecting Botany specimens.
What you want me for?
Oh, Mr. Benedict wanted you to meet him at the orphanage at one o'clock.
Sounds like trouble.
I hardly got my line wet.
Why don't you fish a little longer and...
Andy, it's taken me two thirds of a lifetime...
...to learn that when there's trouble ahead...
...there's no use trying to find entertainment in the meantime.
So, come on to the orphanage.
Dad, I've been wanting to talk to you for quite some time now.
Well, I've been around.
Shoot.
You want me to be a success in life, don't you?
I certainly do.
Well, is it true that all successful men...
...marry sophisticated women, you know...
...women of the world.
I hardly think so.
But it'd help, though, wouldn't it?
Have a wife that could handle chauffeurs and footmen... and be at home as in a nightclub as well as in a kitchen?
I see your point.
You know, you're a swell guy, Dad, but I've often wondered how far you'd have gone in this world...
...if you'd have married a woman like Cleopatra.
I don't dare think of it.
What about the nice old-fashioned girls like Polly Benedict?
I've been going around too steadily with Polly Benedict.
I'm gonna have a little talk with her about it.
I see.
Take the first turn for the orphanage.
Now wait for me.
In the meantime you might cogitate on the fact...
...that Cleopatra brought disgrace, disaster and death...
...to every man who ever fell in love with her.
Death, where is thy sting?
Well, hello there!
You're new here, aren't you?
Please, yes, sir.
My name's Francis, please.
I'm glad to know you, Francis.
- Hello, little girl.
- I'm a boy, please.
Hm, you talk like a little girl.
How do you ever expect to grow up and be a big he-man?
Like you?
Yes, son.
Now look, my boy.
If you go through life the way you're starting, people are always going to be taking your marbles away from you.
Let me give you a little man-to-man advice.
Now...
The default of the bonds in your trust fund...
...absolves the Cyrus Carvel estate of any further financial responsibility.
Default of bonds?
Why, Cyrus Carvel left millions.
Yes, and he left a good half million of it to maintain his old home for our orphans.
Sixteen homeless orphans where the founder of Carvel...
...wouldn't want that to happen any more than we do.
As my son Andrew would say,
'They can't do this to us!'
But that letter, Jim. Those big
New York lawyers can't be wrong.
No? I drew up the trust fund legal papers myself.
They're absolutely foolproof,
I made sure of that.
Are you positive?
I'll stake my legal reputation on it.
I'm so positive I'll go to New York myself...
...and personally handle Messrs... uh, Dabney, Court and Underwood.
Now what's your name?
My name's Butch and what do you want to make of it?
There, that's swell, that's swell.
Now don't forget anything that I told you.
Andy!
Hello, Polly.
Just run along and play with your little bicycle, my little man.
Your uncle Andrew has a very painful duty to perform.
I'm waiting for my father.
Say, Polly, I'd like to have a little talk with you.
I'd like to have a little talk with you too, Andy.
I don't think we ought to go together so steadily.
What?
Well, relationships like ours sometimes grow into more serious things.
And a girl of seventeen is always older, and more mature, more sophisticated than a boy of the same age.
Why, you're crazy... you're crazy, Polly.
- The situation isn't fair to you.
- Fair to me?
Who was it that failed in Geometry the year I got B+?
And who was it said only last Sunday...
...that the Epistles were the wives of the apostles?
As Mark Anthony said,
'Et tu, Brute!'
It wasn't Mark Anthony, it was Julius Caesar.
Wouldn't you be happier with somebody who could look up to you?
Look up to me?
Oh, my gosh!
Miss Benedict, there are some girls of 17 that make you seem like a mere child.
A backward child at that.
Good day, Miss Benedict.
Well, I suppose I'll have to see you at the editors' meeting.
But kindly continue to address me as Miss Benedict!
Choo-choo-choo-choo-choo.
Well, young fellow, do you like it here?
You said a mouthful, toots!
The editor-in-Chief of the Carvel High Olympian...
...requests the gentleman associate editor to kindly pay attention!
Oh, I've got more important things on my mind, Beezy.
Botany, for instance.
Say, Andy, can I borrow your Botany book?
You cannot!
He probably has Botany confused with Mother Goose...
...and he won't go to bed without it.
Okay, you rat!
The meeting will come to order to approve the cover for the next issue.
Oh, here it is.
What?
Why, Beezy, you're not gonna put
Cynthia Potter's picture on the cover...
...and call it the most beautiful girl in the world, are you?
Well, if she isn't, who is?
Maybe the most beautiful girl in the world don't even live here in Carver.
Andy, please, I practically promised
Cynthia she'd be on the cover.
All in favor of Cynthia's picture.
- No!
- No!
Oh...
I vote for a cover with the most...
...interesting achievement of the month by a student.
And I don't mean boyish pranks.
I hate to agree with Miss Benedict, but...
- ...I vote for the same thing.
- Oh, I'm ruined.
Well, meeting's adjourned.
Thanks, Andy,
I'll give this back Monday.
Hey, you lay that down, Beezy, that's my property!
Why, Andy, he doesn't mean any harm.
Hey, look at this!
Daphne Fowler, Princess Royal of the 400.
Look, Polly, the book's filled with pictures of that dame.
Well, of all the ridiculous little-boy exhibitions.
Andy's got a crush on Daphne Fowler!
Collecting pictures of a perfectly awful girl that he's never seen.
I have so seen her.
I... I met her about two years ago.
The first time I met her even, she liked me more than she ought.
Why, Daphne Fowler goes around with grown men.
She wouldn't even look twice at a small-town schoolboy.
Oh, yeah?
Well, she was so crazy about me...
...she asked me to come back and have the first dance with her...
...when she made her debut.
Then why don't you go?
Well, I have been begging my father to let me go to New York.
- You could always run away from home.
- Sure, you can hop a freight.
Yeah, maybe you do things like that and break your mother's heart.
But I've been brought up better.
Furthermore, I doubt if I could even get away from New York...
...without having to marry her.
But of course he can't possibly get to New York.
Of course it would be great if I could get to New York.
But I suppose we all have our crosses to bear in this unhappy world.
Well, good evening, everybody.
Here it comes.
Here what comes?
What you've been dying to tell us ever since you got home.
Can't fool me, James Hardy.
I give up.
Well, to make a long story short, we're all going to New York City for a visit.
- New York, all of us?
- How wonderful!
New York?
But we won't know how to act.
There's always Grandmother's book on etiquette.
New York!
Yes, I've got to lick a big New York law firm for the orphanage.
How's that sound, Andy?
Uh... why... I can't go to New York.
Well, miracles never cease.
- Why?
- Why, I can't go and I won't go.
Here, here, here, wait a minute.
Why do we have to go to New York?
Why did we have to pick that place?
Why, in New York vice and corruption forage rampant!
They'll tell you so in the paper.
New York's a sink of...of.. well, it's a sink.
I don't want to go,
I wouldn't be safe there.
Well, I've got to go to New York.
If the mountain won't come to Mohammed,
Mohammed has to go to the mountain.
What would he want with a mountain anyway?
You may never have another chance to see New York.
What has New York have that Carvel hasn't?
Just a lot of tall buildings.
And what do people do when they get in tall buildings?
They jump out of windows, that's what they do.
I tell you New York is a den of evil.
Well, son, New York is evil in some of its aspects.
But so is every village and city in the world.
But the fact remains, we're leaving for New York.
James, you don't really want me to go.
Why, there's my school, and the expense.
Milly, when I married your sister
I said whither thou goest I will go.
And I might also have added
'I'll take your sister too.'
As regards your school,
I've already spoken to your principal.
And what about my school, Dad?
I'll miss my classes,
I'll get behind, and I won't graduate.
I'll end up a homeless derelict in the gutter
Aunt Milly is going to give you your lessons...
...every day until we get back.
And I've wired Martha Booth to find accommodations.
Then Andy can have Betsy Booth for a playmate.
She must be 15 now, a nice old-fashioned girl, too
I think it's wonderful.
Well, dinner's getting cold.
Come on, Andrew, eat your dinner.
A guy's world comes crashing down around his shoulders...
...and you offer him corned beef and cabbage.
Something tells me we have Mr. Andrew
Hardy right where we want him.
Hello!
This is Miss Polly Benedict speaking.
Oh... hello, Miss Benedict.
Yes, I've read the morning papers.
Well, it's not positive that I'm going to New York with the family.
I don't feel so well.
Oh, you'll feel better just as soon as you're on the train...
...speeding to the side of your loved one.
You'll be glad to know that we're printing the story...
...of your flaming romance with Daphne
Fowler in the high-school magazine.
You're gonna what?
But you mustn't print anything about me and Daphne.
It's a secret.
Listen, Hardy, Cynthia Potter ain't ever gonna speak to me again, so you'd better make good with that debutante.
Cause when you get home you'll be the talk of the town.
Talk of the town, huh?
We just know you're going to send us back a photograph...
...of darling Daphne and you to illustrate the story.
You what?
You... and Beezy... agreed...
...you're gonna put it on the cover too, huh?
Yeah... yeah...
Goodbye.
Andrew, we'll meet you and your father at the station.
Be there early because the engineer may be in a hurry to start.
And don't forget to turn the gas out under the coffee pot...
...when your dad's had his last cup.
Well, did you tend to everything on your mother's list?
Everything but the kitchen stove.
You better do that now.
I don't want any more coffee.
Now what was it Mother wanted me to do?
Oh, yes, I know...
I'm sure that's what Mother wanted me to do.
Andrew!
Ugh...
Uuugh...
For goodness' sake, what's the matter with you?
Don't worry about me, Dad.
Just go on and catch your train.
- Oh, what's wrong?
- I've had a complete nervous breakdown.
One minute I had my health, the next minute I collapsed.
- Collapsed?
- I saw purple spots in front of my eyes.
Then everything went black.
I think I've got heart trouble.
I've just read a new treatment for heart trouble.
It consists of grabbing the patient violently by the back of the neck...
Oh, no, no, no, Dad, please just leave me alone...
...just let me lie here and die peacefully.
Andrew Hardy, if you aren't up on your feet in 3 seconds, I'll...
Ohh...
Oh, well, it was worth trying.
You... you come along.
Andrew, I don't want to pry into your secrets, but all this to-do about going to New York has me worried.
Dad, I can't tell you about that.
But maybe if we sat down and talked life over carefully...
...for, say, about half hour or so...
And carefully miss the train?
No, Andrew, we're leaving this minute.
- Come on.
- That's, uh... final?
That is final.
Well, we'd better get a move on then, Dad, because I...
...set the clock back 10 minutes.
You did...
You what?
Come on!
It's stupendous!
- It's unbelievable.
- Even if I see it, I don't believe it.
- James.
- Hm?
- That building.
- What?
It's on fire!
Oh, Mother, that's steam escaping.
I guess I'm nervous about fire.
Andrew, are you sure you turned out the gas underneath the coffee pot?
Mom, don't I always do everything you tell me to?
James, Martha Booth's husband is a rich man.
Suppose she reserves rooms in some very expensive hotel.
Don't you worry, Mother, I got a telegram on the train this morning from Betsy.
Her mother and father are out of town, but everything's okay.
1057 East 49th.
This is what New York City calls a maisonette.
An apartment remodeled from one floor...
...of an old brownstone residence.
James, I smell coffee.
Of course you smell coffee.
There's a general housework girl here.
Why, it's Betsy Booth!
Sure, I'm Betsy.
I hope you didn't mind my answering...
...your telegram the way I did.
Oh, hello, Mrs. Hardy!
Do you like the apartment?
Isn't it cute? The servant girl can't come until tomorrow...
...so I'm making some coffee.
Hello, Andy, gee it's wonderful to see you!
Will somebody please help me get out of this apron?
You know, I didn't think you'd get here for half an hour yet.
Oh, Andy, it's so wonderful to see you.
I guess I said that before, though, didn't I?
You know... well, welcome to New York, everybody.
I'm all out of breath, ain't I... aren't I?
Well, I'm a little out of breath myself, Betsy.
Don't tell me you got this apartment and hired a girl all by yourself.
Uh-huh, I sure did.
There, you see, Andy.
Even in New York a nice girl thinks more about growing up to be a good housewife...
...than dancing the rumble.
Ma, rhumba!
I smell the coffee burning.
Oh, Andy...
I brought my own radio over for you to listen to.
You see, Mrs. Hardy, it's only common gratitude, after all, back in Carvel Andy took me to my first grown-up party.
Son, how do you do it?
Oh, Dad, she doesn't mean anything.
It's...
Well, it's hero worship, that's all.
Well, my little hero, let's get unpacked.
Mother, I'll bet this will be one of the most exciting times in our lives.
Why, I could lick my weight in wildcats in this town.
Emily, don't tell me you actually brought this book of etiquette.
Why, darling, that's the way people conducted themselves...
...way back in the eighties.
Nice people never change.
James, do you think it's all right for Andy to walk home with Betsy?
- Hm?
- Well, I mean, there are gangsters.
They might take Andy for a ride, or put him on the spot.
Well, Betsy's a New Yorker, so of course she carries a gat.
Oh, of course...
Oh, my goodness!
And what I don't know about New York...
...I've been reading in the guide book and I can show you everything.
Like the Statue of Liberty, and Grant's Tomb...
- ...Rockefeller Center...
- Kid's stuff.
Yes, I... I suppose so.
Even if it is a little hard around Rockefeller Center.
Oh, and here's Saint Patrick's Cathedral.
I was here at a wedding last week.
Aren't weddings wonderful?
I'll never know. I expect to live and die a bachelor.
Here's where we live, see?
Way up on the top floor.
Sure, very interesting for tourists.
Yeah, I suppose so.
Well, gee, Andy, it was swell of you to bring me home.
- Oh, nothing at all, Beth.
- Won't you come in?
No, thanks, I've got to be going home, I...
I've got a desperate problem on my hands...
It's me against the city of New York...
...and one of us is going to be ruined in the struggle.
Say, maybe it would help you if you used Mother's car...
...and chauffeur while the folks are away.
Say, that would help a lot, thanks.
Only I think that...
...maybe she'd like me to stay right with the car.
You know, to see that it'd be safe.
Well, sure, that's all right...
I don't mind you riding around with me, providing you don't ask any personal questions.
Oh, I won't. I'll just snuggle up in the corner.
You won't even know I'm there.
What time shall I bring the car tomorrow?
What time do New Yorkers usually get up?
What do you care? If there's anybody you want to see, we'll wake them up.
All right, then let's get an early start.
Say about 6:30?
Oh, well...
I think there might be just a few people in New York...
...that even we couldn't get up that early.
Why don't we start about nine?
All right, nine it is.
Goodbye, Beth.
Goodbye, Andy.
Good afternoon, Miss Booth.
Lovely day, isn't it?
Kid's stuff.
Good afternoon, Miss Booth.
And how are you today?
I'll never know.
Good afternoon. There's some mail on the drawing-room table.
Very interesting...
...for tourists.
Good afternoon, Miss.
Will there be anyone for dinner,
Miss Booth?
I expect to live and die a bachelor.
Mom.
Yes, dear?
If I asked you something very confidential, you wouldn't betray me to your husband, would you?
My husband?
Why, my husband's your father.
Yes...
Oh, I see what you mean.
No, dear, no.
Look, Ma, if you were a stranger in a strange city, and you wanted to meet someone that you'd never met before... how would you go about meeting them?
- Them?
- Say one or two, or just one person.
Well, I'd write them a nice little letter.
Let's look at Grandmother Hardy's book of etiquette.
That's it, Mom.
Saturate me with etiquette.
Of course a letter like this couldn't be sent through the mail.
It would have to be delivered in person.
Gosh, Mom, you must have been reading my mind.
A letter introducing a young man still unknown to fame...
...to a lady of fashion or of distinguished social position.
'Dear Madam, permit me to present to you my friend...'
'Mr. John Smith,'
Who's John Smith?
It would be you, dear.
Where was I?
'...to present to you my friend,
Mr. Andrew Hardy,'
'a gentleman whose polished manners and irreproachable character,'
Boy, Mom, that's me all over.
Now, you wait here, Betsy... and don't follow me.
No, I'll even keep my eyes shut.
- Oh, and don't you look, Prentiss.
- No, Miss Betsy.
Is she in?
- She?
- I mean, is Miss Fowler in?
I have a letter for her.
I'll see that Miss Fowler gets it.
Not this letter. This has to be delivered personally.
Come in, please.
I'll speak to Mrs. Hacket as soon as she's free...
...and you can give your letter to her.
- Who's Mrs. Hacket?
- Miss Fowler's secretary.
I'm afraid you won't be able to see
Miss Fowler herself.
Oh...
Won't you sit down, please?
Thanks.
- Oh, Mrs. Hacket.
- Yes, Miss Fowler?
Telephone the fashion show, say I'm sorry to be late but I'm leaving here immediately.
I'll attend to it, Miss Fowler.
I know, you get paid by the picture, that's why you take so many.
I get paid by the job, Miss Fowler, but my boss wants 20 new poses.
Can we have the head a little more to the left, please?
Thank you.
Mother.
What is it, young man?
Oh... I have a letter here for Miss Fowler.
It's a very special letter and it has to be delivered in person.
I'll take it, please.
No...
Well, there's nothing in it that a girl's mother shouldn't read, so I guess it's all right.
What is it, Mother?
Nothing, my dear.
Come with me, please.
- With you?
- This way.
You know, Mrs. Fowler, it's going to be a real pleasure...
...to make your daughter's acquaintance.
Well, I'm afraid it won't be as simple as that, you see... my daughter has a great many demands on her time and energy.
She can't accept all the friendship offered.
And... well, friendships aren't established by letters of introduction.
- They aren't?
- No. You see...
Friendships come as a result of knowing the same people, liking the same things, having common bonds of mutual interests.
You mean that I couldn't have a mutual interest with your daughter?
I'm afraid not.
You mean I'm not her social equal?
Well, let us just say that your paths...
...seem to go in different directions.
Well, you know, me... that is, my family and me... we're very nice people.
- Honest we are.
- I'm sure of that.
But there are millions of nice people in the world and...
Well, Daphne can't be friends with all of you.
You see what I mean.
Yes... I see.
You mean there's no special reason...
...why I should be friends with your daughter.
- That's it.
- And...
...an awfully good reason why I shouldn't.
I'm sorry, but, you know, back where I come from... everybody has a mutual interest in everybody else.
Of course.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Oh... I...
- I hope I didn't cause you any trouble.
- Not at all.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Andy...
Andy, darling, what's the matter?
I just aged 50 years.
Wh...what happened just now?
Oh, that's right, I promised
I wouldn't ask any questions.
What happened to me is a secret I'll carry to the grave.
Where to, Miss Booth?
Anywhere.
Anywhere where I can find some peace.
Grant's Tomb, Prentiss.
'Let us have peace.'
General Grant, you and me both.
Well, let's go on inside.
Maybe the coffins'll cheer you up.
It's a fine world.
Back in Carvel there are people waiting to laugh at my funeral and...
...here in New York they got coffins to cheer me up.
Oh, I'm sorry...
I only meant that maybe the coffins would make you be glad just to be alive.
Hm... there's something in that.
There's something, but not much.
Isn't it impressive?
Now don't you feel glad just to be alive?
I never before really appreciated the advantage of being dead.
Oh, Andy, couldn't you tell me your problem?
I'm a woman, and maybe I could help.
I can't tell anybody.
Tragedy is gnawing at my vitals...
...but I can't tell anybody.
But you mustn't give up.
Look at Ulysses S. Grant.
He didn't give up when things looked the darkest.
He never had trouble like I got.
All he had on his hands was a Civil War.
Well, then you pretend that all you have is a Civil War.
Andy, can't you tell me what your trouble is?
Did General Grant talk or did he act?
Then you won't surrender?
You'll plan a new campaign?
Betsy, I shall search out the enemy's weakest point...
...and make use of strategy.
If I'm late for lunch, all the strategy in the world won't help me with my dad.
Come on!
- James!
- Oh, hello, Milly.
Well, how's the big fur coat deal coming along?
Emily fall for it?
I've got Emily fooled.
She thinks the coat's for me.
But so far she says they're all too young or too expensive.
You keep at it. I've wanted her to have a good fur coat all her life.
But don't let on it's for her until we get home.
Oh, I won't. She'd pop right back to the store...
...and exchange the coat for a new kitchen stove.
- Oh, James.
- Hm?
How's your orphanage business working out?
Wonder if the children are home.
Milly,
I've been twice to the plush-lined offices of Dabney, Court and Underwood...
...but it appears that mighty
Mr. Underwood is away on a shooting trip.
No one else around the office seems to know what it's all about...
...or even think it's important.
So I'm going to court and force a little action.
- Good.
- But don't tell Emily. She'd only worry.
Hello.
Well, who do you think you are?
Ulysses S. Hardy.
In the matter of the Cyrus Carvel Estate... versus the Carvel County Orphanage, Inc.
- Ready for the Orphanage, Your Honor.
- Ready for the Estate.
I'm Underwood.
My office didn't tell me about this...
...until your letter arrived.
Sorry.
Your name is Handy, isn't it?
No apologies are needed, sir, but the name is Hardy.
Will you explain your petition, sir?
To force the Cyrus Carvel Estate to resume supporting our orphanage.
If it please the Court, I can save the taxpayers a lot of money.
Obviously you are not aware of this amendment to the original agreement.
1931. Signed by Harland W. Wyatt.
President of the Carvel County's
Orphanage, Inc.
At the worst of the Depression,
Wyatt demanded...
...that we switch the United States Securities...
...in the Orphanage Trust Fund to European bonds.
I see.
Recent European developments... those bonds are worthless.
Those European bonds defaulted.
The Trust has no further obligation.
This is Mr. Wyatt's legal acceptance of the exchange.
The Cyrus Carvel Estate requests that you dismiss Judge Hardy's petition.
Your Honor, this is a shocking surprise.
May I ask that this matter be continued until Monday?
Which will give me time to consider my position.
It is so ordered.
And we are happy therefore to bring you the voice...
... of the glamourous and glowing example of young American girlhood.
She who has been called the number 1 debutante of New York society,
Miss Daphne Fowler.
Thank you, Mr. Franklin.
Ladies and gentlemen, as President of the Dog Lovers Society,
I invite all dog lovers to a benefit we are giving at the Club Sirocco.
The entire receipts of the Club Sirocco...
...will go to our fund for homeless dogs.
I especially want to meet all the people who have with me...
...a mutual interest in the welfare of our little four-footed friends.
Betsy!
- Mr. Andrew Hardy.
- Oh, show him in, please.
- Good evening, Betsy.
- Good evening, Andy.
- Did it come? Where is it?
- Yes. It's there in the guestroom.
- Don't move, don't look, just wait.
- All right.
Betsy, what you're about to behold...
...is something most children are never privileged to see.
# Alone, alone with a sky of romance #
# Above, alone #
# Alone on a night that was meant #
# For love #
# There must be someone waiting #
# Who feels the way I do #
# Whoever you are #
# Are you, are you? #
# Alone #
# Alone on this night that we two #
# Could share #
# Alone #
# Alone with the kiss that could make #
# Me care #
# And when you come, my promise #
# To be your very own #
# Alone #
# Alone with a heart meant for you #
I'm ready, Betsy, here I come!
Oh...
Ain't I something?
Andy, you're beautiful!
But don't you think there might possibly be something wrong with the hat?
Yeah, I kinda thought it was small too, Betsy, but...
...I didn't know how they were wearing them this season in New York.
But you got a 6 7.8 didn't you?
Oh, Andy, I got mixed up.
I got a 6 7.8 glove and a 5 1/2 hat.
- Oh... what are we gonna do?
Uh... my Dad's!
Gee, that certainly was a narrow escape.
- New York must be full of midgets.
- Here, try this one.
Oh!
Your father must have a noble head.
Paper!
We'll stuff it with paper.
We can do it.
Oh, that's my dad's too.
I almost forgot all about a stud.
It certainly does look like the real thing.
Andy, I don't want to ask any questions but...
I've heard that the Club Sirocco is awfully expensive.
Think nothing of it, my child,
Even if it's the swellest joint in New York...
...they couldn't charge more than a buck for dinner.
Oh, but they charge much more than that, Andy.
Oh, I've got money to burn!
However, Betsy, there is something you could tell me.
- What?
- Well, most likely...
...the food in New York is different than that of Carvel.
So maybe you could tell me how to order a magnificent dinner, huh?
Oh, I'm afraid I couldn't.
But I heard my dad say once...
...that if you want to go to a strange restaurant, and get the best food...
...just ask the waiter for the specialty of the house.
Specialty of the house, huh?
Thanks a lot, Betsy, thanks a million.
You've been simply grand.
It's nothing.
You couldn't have done more for me had you been an adult my own age.
Oh, gosh, I don't want to be late.
Where's my coat?
Andy, are you sure you've got enough money?
- You know, that Club Sirocco...
- Betsy, please don't worry.
Listen, suppose the dinners are $2, suppose the dinners are $3...
Oh, but Andy...
Listen, I've got $8 in my bankroll.
With $8 I could buy the Club Sirocco.
- Good night.
- Good night.
# And when you come I promise #
# To be your very own #
# Alone #
# Alone with a heart meant for you #
# Alone #
Your check, sir.
Oh... thanks.
I beg your pardon, sir.
Have you a reservation?
The name, please.
Well... I haven't got a reservation but my name is Hardy.
Which Hardy is that, sir, if you please?
- My father's Judge Hardy.
- Oh, Judge, this way, sir.
Uh, I'm in the right place, ain't I?
This is the Club Sirocco...
...where Miss Daphne Fowler's having her dog lovers party?
That's right, sir.
This is her table here.
Uh...
What time do you expect Miss Fowler?
Not until later.
Your shirt stud, sir.
Oh...
Will you order now, sir?
Some hors d'oeuvres, perhaps?
I'll just take the specialty of the house.
That'll be caviar Romanoff aux tortoni.
I'll have a double order then.
And after this what will monsieur have?
Just continue, my man, the specialty of the house.
Shall I carve it, sir?
Yeah, yeah.
Say, waiter, isn't it pretty near time for Miss Fowler to arrive?
Later, I believe.
For dessert, sir, may I suggest another specialty?
Your judgement is beyond reproach.
We call this bombe à la Corsican.
Ice cream with a French accent.
You look like a man who needs a dog very badly.
A dog?
A worthy charity.
I'll buy one.
Each one autographed by Miss Fowler in person.
Miss Fowler! Is she here?
Not until later, I believe.
$20, please.
- Yes, sir.
Oh, no, thank you, I mean...
That is, I just noticed that the little dogs...
...they were made of fur and I'm very allergic to fur, no thank you.
Imagine charging $20 for a little 10c dog like that.
At that rate they'd charge you...
Well...
Waiter.
Excuse me.
Something else, sir?
How much is it costing me for this dinner?
Um... in between $35 and $40, sir.
30 or 40?
Yes, sir.
Anything else, sir?
Yes...
You can take me to see the proprietor.
He said he was Judge Hardy's son.
And I don't want to offend anyone connected with a judge.
I don't seem to recall any Judge Hardy in this city.
My father is Judge Hardy of Carvel.
What's Carvel?
Some little hillbilly town?
We're not hillbillies.
We wear shoes every day
Oh, well that's a big help.
And dress suits every night too?
I...
I rented this.
Putting on a big front, eh?
You also told Fred here that you were a friend of Daphne Fowler's.
I did not.
I just asked if she was coming.
I've never exactly met Miss Fowler.
Just an all-around-four-flusher.
You should have seen the way he ordered.
He didn't even glance at the menu.
You could've at least looked at the prices, couldn't you?
Yes.
But you wanted everybody to think you were a big shot.
Yes, I did.
Well, what are we going to do about this $34.75?
Well...
I've got $8 and...
...maybe I could work out the balance by...
...washing dishes, or I could...
...or I could send you $1 a week...
Please, don't send me to jail, will you?
You don't want to bring your poor father...
...down in gray hairs to his grave, eh?
He's pretty gray-haired already.
Well, I know your type.
You're just a small-town sport, not dry behind the years yet.
Because you were king of kids in your own hometown...
...you've got delusions of grandeur.
When I was a boy we used to call your kind 'too big for their britches'.
But I don't think you even rate jail.
I think you need a good spanking.
Fred, put bub in a taxi.
Be sure the driver gets the right address.
Come on, son.
- Oh, come in, come in, Betsy.
- Good morning. May I see Andy, please?
He must have got in pretty late last night.
- We were asleep.
- Oh, I won't wake him then.
Oh, boy, he must have had a big night last night.
It's time for him to get up.
Andrew.
Andrew! Wake up!
It's Betsy Booth.
Good morning, Betsy.
Good morning, Dad.
Good morning, son.
Gee, you sure look like a gorgeous wreck.
Come in, please.
Tell me all about it.
Andy, what's wrong?
I don't care to discuss it.
I'm sorry.
I brought back your clothes.
Yeah, I packed the dress suit there...
I was going to bring it back.
At the present time I don't care to come in contact with my family.
You've been simply wonderful to me, Betsy, but I just don't care to talk about anything now, you know what I mean?
All right.
Well, I... I hope I'll be seeing you when you feel better.
Yeah, sure, I'll call you as...
...as soon as the world is normal again.
Whenever it is.
Oh, my father's shirt stud, it's in here all right, isn't it?
The stud, yeah... well, Betsy, it was a little loose...
...and I thought that maybe I'd have it fixed before I brought it back.
Oh, fine. My father's very keen about that stud.
He paid $400 for it.
Bye, Andy.
Bye, Judge Hardy. And don't be worried about Andy and me being mysterious.
What I'm worried about isn't Andy.
Bye.
Or maybe it is.
Some mail for you.
It's from Polly Benedict and F. Bacon Anderson.
F. Bacon Anderson, I presume, is Beezy?
Bad news?
Andy, I have problems of my own but...
...but I can help you if I could.
- You can't help with this.
- Help with what?
Oh, it's not your fault, Dad, more than it is mine, you being born what you are and...
...and me what I am.
What are you?
Dad, why couldn't I have had a family who had money, family trees and, you know, that kind of stuff?
You have a family tree.
You have parents, and grandparents, and great-grandparents like every living soul in the world.
- That's not what I mean.
- Well, what do you mean?
Why couldn't we have had class, money, and social position?
Why couldn't we have been somebodies instead of nobodies?
Gee, for the first time in my life I've realized...
... I'm not as good as somebody else.
You do, eh?
You get your hat and coat... and come with me.
What's this place?
This is the Hall of Fame of New York University.
Dedicated in humble tribute... to mighty men which were of old men of renown.
I brought you here to show you some nobodies...
...that turned out to be somebodies.
I never thought I'd hear you, my own son,
...deny the very soil you walk on.
The soil that was earned for you...
...by the blood and tears of men who said that all men in America...
...should be equal.
Equal.
That's funny.
Well, equal in that they shall all have equal opportunity.
Alexander Hamilton.
Patrick Henry.
Andrew Jackson.
They left you a heritage of freedom and equality.
A heritage you should fight to keep.
Instead of kicking it around, sniveling about class, money and social position.
What's all that talk got to do with the fact...
...that I've got to go back to Carvel...
...and face the worse punishment a guy ever had to take?
Punishment.
There's a man over there.
Born a poor boy.
He took quite a bit of punishment.
That was fine 100 years ago, when a guy had a chance but...
Now there's millions of people like us that...
Well, I don't want to talk about it.
You don't understand and you never will.
Oh...
- You've reached that age, eh?
- What's age got to do with it?
Back in a little tank-town like Carvel
I might be king of the kids...
...but here in New York I'm...
...just a small-town hick with delusions of grandeur and...
...and you're just a country judge that nobody ever heard of.
When a boy's stupid, he's just stupid, that's all.
Come on home.
Reduced to these basic chemical elements, therefore, the human body has a commercial value of about 90c.
I'll sell out cheaper.
Name me 5 of those elements, Andrew.
Calcium, sodium, phosphorus, iron... and misery, I guess.
Andrew, have you had a row with your father?
I thought so.
That's why I suggested your lessons...
... instead of your going with him to see the Statue of Liberty.
Headache no better, dear?
- The orphanage case?
- Yes.
They got me licked.
And all because Harlan Wyatt lost faith in his own country.
Oh, those poor children.
And I was so sure of coming to New York and showing them a thing or two.
I guess this town's too big for me.
Oh don't, dear, please.
Come on, you two, we can see it beautifully now.
In this city that doesn't appreciate my husband, I don't think much of.
And I wouldn't hesitate to say it to the mayor himself.
Well! I'd think that every man, woman and child in America...
...would be grateful to what that stands for.
The flame of liberty.
Flame?
James, even if our home is just a little house in a little town, there'd be something in the New York papers if it burned down, wouldn't there?
Mother, is the gas under your coffee pot...
...all that the Statue of Liberty means to you?
No, James Hardy, it isn't.
It means that... that people can't get together behind somebody else's back...
...and conspire to take away their privileges.
Not bad, Mother, not bad.
Take away their privileges, huh?
Take away their privileges?
Why, of course!
- Why didn't I think of that?
- Think of what?
Mother, you just said, 'Conspire behind their back to take away their privileges.
I believe you've saved the orphanage.
Now listen. I'm going to hop a plane and fly back to Carvel.
So, Marian, you have Andrew down at the Courthouse Monday morning at 9:30
...with my briefcase and papers...
The Cyrus Carvel Estate versus the Carvel County Orphanage Inc.
If it please the court,
I'm Judge Hardy's son.
He told me to meet him here at 9:30 and it's past ten...
He's got to be here soon.
We'll give him every opportunity.
I ask the court to pardon for being late.
There is one essential point of law.
An agreement entered into by two parties...
...for the benefit of the third party.
...cannot be amended without the consent of the third party
And the third party specifically mentioned...
...in our original agreement...
...is,
I quote...
'The creation and maintenance of the Carvel Orphan's Home... for the benefit of all homeless orphans of Carvel...
...under the age of 18 years.
I would like to amend my petition to name a new petitioner.
And who is the new petitioner,
Judge Hardy?
Just a minute, just...
Your Honor, this is the new petitioner.
One of the homeless orphans of Carvel under 18 years of age.
With the Court's permission I should like to question the petitioner.
Francis, did you ever sign... an amendment to the original trust agreement...
...between the Carvel Orphan's Home...
...and the trustees of the estate of Cyrus Carvel?
No, Your Honor.
No, Your Honor.
It is our contention that Mr. Underwood...
...is therefore obligated to put back the United States securities...
...eliminated by the amendment.
...and to continue payments to the orphanage.
If Your Honor please...
...I don't think that I would care to oppose this new petitioner...
...before a jury of 12 good Americans and truth.
And if Your Honor will consent to a further adjournment,
I am certain that we can work out...
...an arrangement satisfactory to everybody.
- So ordered.
- How does that strike you, Francis?
You said a mouthful, toots.
Off the record, I should like to remark that in my opinion...
...Judge Hardy has also said a mouthful.
Certainly nobody in this country wants to see helpless orphans left uncared for.
Most admirable, Judge Hardy.
- Thank you, sir.
- Next case!
What about my club for lunch,
Judge Hardy?
- I don't want a club.
- Well, what do you want, sonny?
My name's Butch and I want to go back there.
- What for?
- I want to watch His Honor...
...in the black nightshirt.
Well, supposing I take Butch home for the day?
My wife and I haven't had children of ours for 30 years.
- Well, think you'd enjoy him for a day?
- I think I would.
And, speaking of children, what's become of your son?
Forgot all about him.
Well, I think he went on home.
Well, I'll have the youngster home by sundown.
- Goodbye, Butch.
- Goodbye, toots.
Dad!
Yes?
Dad,
I just wanted to tell you how proud I am...
You showing up that Mr. Underwood.
That's not the real point.
But they say he makes over a million dollars a year.
Did you notice that the court treated me with equal consideration?
Millions or not.
They did, didn't they?
And the real point is that I had an opportunity to win.
A small-town judge...
...with no social position had an opportunity equal...
...with the big-city lawyer.
An opportunity guaranteed by the law itself.
The mighty men of old made this that kind of a country.
And that kind of a country,
God willing, it always will be.
Dad, you...
...probably won't forgive me.
You shouldn't ever.
I don't deserve to be your son.
What I'm wondering is, do you deserve to be any decent American's son.
Gosh, I don't know what got into me.
I guess I was led astray when I put all my faith into General Grant...
...and he stabbed me in the back.
Yes?
It all just goes to show you what will happen to a man...
...when he lets love blind him to the principles of democracy.
Love again, Andrew?
Yeah, love.
I know it doesn't sound very logical starting out with love...
... and ending up losing a $400... pearl stud.
A $400 pearl?
Well, I think during this subway ride...
...we'd better have a serious man-to-man talk.
- Yes, sir.
- But this time...
...start at the beginning, the very beginning.
The beginning was when debutantes started to wear strapless evening gowns.
Well, that'll do as a beginning.
Go on.
- Hello, Andy.
- Hello, Betsy, come in.
Andy, you didn't call me all day today.
- Are you mad at me?
- I'm mad at the world.
I've got more troubles than anybody since Job in the Bible.
I wouldn't be a bit surprised if by tomorrow I got boils too.
Oh, you and trouble just naturally gravitate to each other, don't you?
If you're worried about losing the pearl stud,
I'm not going to tell anybody about your wearing it.
How did you know I lost it?
You weren't a very good actor, Andy.
Now do you feel better?
I'm in more trouble than that.
Why, I don't dare go back to Carvel.
I'd be the joke of the town.
The little children would follow me down the street laughing.
Won't you please tell me about it, Andy?
It can't do any harm.
And besides, sometimes a woman's intuition...
...is better than a man's brains.
Betsy, back home I got a crush on a girl that lives here in New York.
Oh, that's bad.
That's nothing. I kind of boasted around to some people in Carvel that...
...she liked me.
Doesn't she?
I never even met her.
And then I got double-crossed.
I got double-crossed right in the bosom of my own family.
My father makes me come to New York.
I... I don't get it.
I've got to get a picture of her and take it back home...
...to prove that she's crazy about me or...
...maybe I can bury myself on a South Sea island.
I suppose she's awful pretty.
Yeah, I guess so.
But, you know, Betsy, I don't think of her as being a real person anymore.
She's... she's more like a goal.
Do you understand?
No, I don't, if you've got a crush on her.
But I haven't... anymore.
Honest, Betsy, I haven't.
I've just got to get her blame picture or I'll be ruined.
That's all she means to me now.
Yeah, but maybe if you really met her you'd go crazy about her again.
No, what I've been through has knocked all that out of me.
No...
- What's her name?
- Daphne Fowler.
Daphne Fowler?
Yes, the number one debutante.
Oh, wonderful!
Hey, are you nuts?
Why are some men so dumb?
- Why didn't you tell me this before?
- Tell you what?
Hello, Stevens? This is Miss Booth.
May I please speak to Miss Fowler?
Thank you.
- You know Daphne Fowler?
- Of course I do!
Hello, Daph?
Daph, it's Betsy.
Oh, that's swell, Daph.
Listen, I want to bring a friend of mine to your debut Monday night.
Oh, he's a swell guy.
He's an old friend of mine.
Oh, thanks, darling.
Listen, are you gonna wear that new black strapless...
...evening dress you tried on last week?
Of course, I would. It's stunning.
All right, darling. I'll tell you all about my friend later.
Bye-bye.
Well, that's settled.
Out of the mouths of babes!
She's a real girl.
Without her makeup on she hasn't anymore glamour than I have.
- She hasn't?
- Specially when she's not dressed up.
Like on Botany trips.
Daphne Fowler likes Botany?
Uh-huh. Only uh...
...she doesn't get much fun out of it because flowers always give her hay fever.
Hay fever, huh?
See, she's kind of susceptible to it because... she's anemic.
In fact, she's so anemic she has to wear long woolen underwear.
Long woolen underwear?
Gosh, it makes me feel kind of funny.
I know...
Whenever I get disillusioned
I always get a pain in my stomach.
Is Miss Betsy Booth here?
They told me at her home she might...
- I'm Betsy Booth.
- I'm from the insurance company.
Your butler reported a valuable pearl stud missing.
Oh, well... I loaned it to a friend...
I'll wire him right away in Chicago and have him send it back.
Have your butler let us know when the pearl is returned...
...then we won't have to notify the police.
Police!
So, that's the whole story,
Judge Hardy.
Naturally, I didn't want the kid's dollar a week.
I know you don't, Mr. Carrillo.
You'd be doing me a favor.
Oh, no.
The show was worth the price of admission.
At two dollars a week out of his allowance...
...my son will have reason to remember...
...New York City for a long, long time.
I get the idea.
Can I send some champagne around to your wife?
Oh, no, thanks.
There is one thing.
Somewhere in his ventures...
...my son lost a very valuable pearl stud.
This one?
Well.
There she is, Andy.
The Number One Glamour Girl.
Are you sure she doesn't make your heart get jittery?
No. Not a jitter.
I'm kind of fed up on glamour.
I'm going back to the nice old-fashioned girls.
You know, the girls who can look up to a man.
Hello, Daph!
Hello, Betsy, how are you?
Oh, you're a knockout on that strapless number.
I'm freezing in it, you know.
- This is Mr. Hardy.
- Yes...
May I present Mr. Andrew Hardy, one of nature's noblemen.
I'm most happy to make your acquaintance, Miss Fowler.
Please, Mr. Hardy, from one dog lover to another.
Mother, do you remember
Mr. Andrew Hardy?
- How do you do? I'm glad you came.
- Yeah, me too.
Shall we go in, Andy?
See you later, Daph.
Andy, Betsy's told me the amazing story of your life.
So restrain yourself until the sixth dance, lover boy.
There's my pet photographer.
Guaranteed not to let your eyes blink.
Here's where we annihilate the unbelievers in Carvel.
Oh, gee, Daph, you're swell.
Remember, the party doesn't get good until after the mob goes home.
Come on.
Come on, Betsy, we're going to get that photograph. Lead on, Andy.
Betsy, I've been working on Andy, and he's really crazy about you.
But he doesn't know it yet.
Now, when the party simmers down...
...I'll arrange it for you to sing and you turn it on hot.
Oh, listen, I've got a song that if it doesn't wake up Andy Hardy up, he must be made out of concrete.
# I woke up this morning and the sun #
# was shining but I didn't see it. #
# Think I drank my orange juice #
# But I don't know #
# I wouldn't guarantee it #
# Wore my yellow dress, #
# or was it blue, oh, what's the use? #
# I don't remember #
# Is it Monday, is it Tuesday, #
# Is it June or is it still December? #
# Sat beside my window #
# watched the couples strolling by #
# Felt so sorry for myself #
# I couldn't even cry #
# Finally I pulled the shade #
# I couldn't stand the gaff #
# So I sat down #
# and wrote my epitaph #
# I'm nobody's baby #
# I wonder why #
# Each night and day I pray #
# The Lord up above #
# Please send me down somebody to love #
# But nobody wants me #
# I'm blue somehow #
# Won't someone hear my plea #
# And take a chance with me #
# Because I'm nobody's baby now #
# Believe me #
# No, nobody's baby #
# And I've got to know #
# the reason why #
# Last week I was walking #
# down the street #
# And met a boy and I said #
# Hey, maybe I was meant for you #
# But he only tipped his hat #
# and shook his head #
# Kept on walking down the avenue #
# Oh, nobody wants me #
# I'm mighty blue somehow #
# Won't someone hear my plea #
# And take a little chance with me? #
# Because I'm nobody's baby #
# I'm blue somehow #
# Won't someone hear my plea #
# And take a chance with me #
# There's no denying #
# I'm crying, I'm lonesome #
# On my ownsome #
# I don't mean maybe #
# I'm nobody's baby #
- One more song.
- No, please, it's so late.
One more song, just one more.
- Gee, Betsy, you were terrific.
- Oh, thanks.
- Let's get out of here, huh?
- Sure.
I want to show you something right here in New York...
...that millions of people never see in their whole lifetime.
What?
A horse.
Come on.
You don't suppose something will happen...
...that'll keep you from going home tomorrow?
No, we have our tickets.
Are you sure it's all right for you to stay out this late?
You know, it's getting dawn.
I'd stay out even if it wasn't all right.
Well, I wouldn't let you. Your mother expects me to take care of you.
It gives me the nicest feeling.
You know, I...
I wish I wasn't leaving New York.
Oh, we can write to each other.
Yeah.
And every time I get a letter I'll pretend you're sending me gardenias.
Like these.
Oh... I'm getting too old for pretending.
I will send you gardenias.
Only not right away on account of that allowance trouble that I told you about.
- Are you cold?
- No, I'm not cold. It's...
...it's just like Indian summer.
You know...
You know, you've changed a lot since the last time you were in Carvel.
- I have?
- Yeah, you're more grown up...
Gee, I completely almost forgot how swell you were.
Maybe I wasn't as swell when I was in Carvel...
Or maybe you just didn't notice.
One thing about me hasn't changed though.
No boy has ever kissed me yet.
You know, I was sitting here thinking that I...
I wanted to...
I wanted to kiss you...
Then when I think that I do, then I'm afraid that I don't.
Don't want to?
Sometimes wanting to and not wanting to is better than wanting to.
I know... I knew you were thinking about kissing me.
And I was just as afraid you would as much as I was afraid you wouldn't.
Gosh, this is much too important to be monkeying around with.
I'll remember that too.
Till we can see each other again.
Betsy,
I'll come back someday.
If you mean that...
...maybe you'd better kiss me even if we both don't want to.
Someday.
Betsy, hey...
Don't cry.
I know why you're crying.
You're crying because...
Because I kissed you.
It isn't that glamourous to cry.
It's funny. When a girl cries because you like her... why, even when her nose is shiny she's glamourous.
Oh, boy, that's what I call glamour.
I'll bet you...
I'll bet your Polly Benedict couldn't be glamourous with a shiny nose.
Polly Benedict? Just you wait until I get back to Carvel.
New York is wonderful, but it's always good to get home.
Excuse me, everybody.
I've got to fix my hair.
Excuse me, too, I've got a couple of predatory insects to destroy.
Save me a trip, will you, son?
Drop Francis off at the orphanage.
Oh, Dad, I'm too big to be carting around babies.
Too big for your britches?
I'm sorry.
Gosh, bub, what a lot of grief you're gonna go through before you're my age.
James, I smell coffee.
Now, now, Mother, that's...
Wasn't I silly to worry?
I just remembered what I told Andy was to cancel the milk.
Don't worry about the milk. I personally told the milkman not to leave any.
Hello, Polly? Have you seen your advanced copy of the Olympian?
No, I haven't yet.
But it's here. I'll look at it right away.
Hold the wire.
I saw it!
I... I...
But how could it ever have happened?
What are we going to do?
Listen, I'll meet you at the school right away.
Of course Andy had the cover changed, but how did he dare?
Oh, Beezy, he did know that girl.
What awful idiots we've been.
Cynthia Potter warned me.
Andy kissed her the first time he took her out.
I should have known better than to trifle with a man like Andy.
Beezy, maybe he's been secretly married to that Daphne Fowler all the time.
Andy Hardy, whose baby is that?
I remember you, sister. You're the little girl that failed in geometry.
It was to protect this innocent babe's future that we went to New York.
What?
Oh, the orphanage.
Polly, look. I thought I was dreaming but they're all the same.
Of course, you printed up the story and I supplied you with an exclusive cover.
And it's not faked either.
I trust that the younger generation of this town...
...has learned to respect its elders.
I'm sorry, Andy.
I take back everything I said.
I'll apologize in writing.
Not necessary at all, bub, you're just too big for your britches.
Take Francis back to the orphanage for me.
Yes, sir...
I mean, yes, Andy.
Come on. You and me we'll stop at Cynthia Potter's.
She's just crazy about babies.
You said a mouthful, toots.
So Daphne Fowler was in love with you all the time.
Well, there's our picture there.
Society's Number One Glamour Girl trying to coax me for a smile.
Swell girl, Daph.
Sort of a.. adolescent Cleopatra.
- Perhaps you are too mature for me.
- No doubt, no doubt.
But you know, Polly, when I was in New York I was thinking.
Sophisticated girls, they make you appreciate old-fashioned girls.
You know, the type that starts to cry when you kiss them.
Are... are you engaged to Daphne Fowler?
Daphne? Oh, no.
Just another milestone in my career.
You know, Polly. You used to be a sweet, unaffected little child.
And I always thought that you kind of looked up to me.
I do, Andy.
I think...
I think I should cry right now if you were to kiss me.
That's a good idea. But of course you don't want to go to extremes.
When you kiss a girl, as I was telling Betsy,
- Betsy!
- Uh, why, It slipped... it slipped out.
Can I help it if I have irresistible charm?
That's not charm. That's polygamy.
But, oh, Andy, how we women love it.
- James, it's lovely.
- You really like it?
It's beautiful.
And since you want us to end up in the poor house, I'll keep it...
James, you're the best husband that ever lived.
Gosh, how one's women do mount up.

I like to see the morning run of my dogs, Carraclough.
-That's what I get up for.
-A beautiful sight to start the day.
All the years I've watched it, every morning is finer than the day before.
You're a great man with dogs, Carraclough.
Thank you, Your Grace.
And that I am.
Good morning, Lassie.
You're still the finest of them all.
Yeah, she's champion.
Finest dog in all of Yorkshire.
Yes, when you've got champion dogs in the country...
...you've got champion men.
I think, sir, 'tis Lassie's tyke himself.
Where is he, girl?
There are only two things in the world
I am proud of:
My puppies and my flowers.
It's either puppies or flowers a man must be proud of.
I don't think it can be both.
-My hydrangeas!
-That's what I meant, sir.
Of all the stupid, crazy puppies in the--
He's not stupid, he's only very young.
Never too early to start his training.
A firm hand, Joe. Belt him one.
I can't. He's such a foolish thing.
Don't you agree, Father?
-I agree with you.
-You're quite wrong, Priscilla.
That pup'll grow up an irresponsible hoodlum.
-Look what he's done to my gardens.
-Perhaps he just doesn't like gardens.
Nonsense! Everybody likes gardens.
Happen it's a point of view.
Your Grace likes them to look at, and the tyke likes them as much to roll in.
Something must be done about that pup.
At last, we've got a dog like our Lassie.
I want him trained, then I'll show him.
I'll make him an international champion.
That's a great deal of "l" for another man's dog.
It's the only way. If you don't train him, it'll be a scandal to every dog lover.
But he's only a puppy, sir.
If there's a scandal to bear, there's no one to bear it but Joe.
For there's nobody's dog but his.
That's the way it was with you, Lassie.
That's the way it's got to be with your tyke.
There's only one way you'll get that dog, Grandfather.
Oh, and how's that?
You'll have to marry into the family.
Wait, Joe.
Laddie, flowers are not to eat.
Good morning, Joe.
Good morning.
Goodbye.
Hey! Look out for my hydrangeas!
Little scoundrel does more damage to them than the pup.
No sense.
Like all the lads these days, no sense at all.
I'm surprised at you, Carraclough.
-You should've been firmer with the lad.
-Your Grace, happen I should.
But the last day of his leave is late to start.
He leaves in the morning for an advanced flying school.
Oh, does he? Good for him.
Look alive, now, girl. Look alive.
I never was so much alive,
Grandfather.
Oh, you can't sleep, so I can't either, eh?
What happens to you happens to me.
What's that, another scratch?
When are you going to learn that there are no friendly cats?
You know you've got to start looking out for yourself when I'm away.
Lose your appetite for other people's shoes.
They don't digest very well, anyway.
And be reserved when people come to call.
A friendly pat doesn't mean they want to wrestle with you.
Now, bear that in mind while I'm away.
Good morning, Lassie.
Look. Look who's here.
Come on. That's enough.
Now, you stay down there.
I gotta get dressed.
Stop it.
Now, you stop that.
I gotta get dressed.
Laddie.
Stop it.
Thank you, Lassie.
That's a good girl.
Now, why can't you do that?
You never learn anything.
Well, you look better in it than I do,
I must say.
Come on.
You know something?
He got your looks, but he didn't get your brains.
Laddie! What are you doing to my football?
What happened?
What happened?!
It's that wild beast of yours!
My washing!
Look!
Go after him, Joe!
He'll have the house about our heads!
Hey, come here!
-Are you hurt?
-Look at him!
Let go! Let go!
You tiger!
Let go!
Your papa's drawers!
Stop him! Stop him!
Laddie!
Oh, my present.
-What is it?
-Well, it-- It was a cake.
My first.
You baked it?
With my own fair hands.
Look at them.
Still, it-- It was worth it.
I've been trying to get into this position for months.
-Sorry.
-Oh, Joe.
What am I going to do about you?
I'm sorry. Laddie ran off with my father's drawers, and I tried to stop him.
Are you going to talk about your father's drawers or me?
-You do like me, don't you?
-l....
-Of course I do.
-Then why don't you say it?
A man doesn't say everything he feels, does he?
Yes, in wartimes, and when he's going away.
-But I'm only off to school, and besides--
-"Besides" what?
Well, it wouldn't be proper.
"Proper is proper," as my father says.
Ask your grandfather.
Grandfather's 60, and he's not going to risk his life.
You're 1 7, and you are going to risk yours.
So it's your right to decide.
Will you leave that dog alone?
Laddie, lie down!
Well!
I suppose he's trained to do that?
No, Priscilla. He's mixed up.
It's clever of him, but it's my fault...
...because one day he was chewing at my trousers...
...and I told him to L-l-E D-O-W-N.
L-l-A-R!
Please, Priscilla, pull it up.
Priscilla!
For pity's sake!
Bloomers start rumors!
I was just showing Joe what fine, straight legs...
...his children are going to have.
Hang their little legs!
Pull your skirt up. Be quick about it.
Hello? A military car.
At last, I'm called up!
Must have been that last letter
I wrote to the prime minister.
-Good morning, I'm the Duke of Rudling.
-Major Ellison. This is Captain Graves.
-How do you do? This is a happy day.
-Thank you, sir.
Among your letters, we find an offer to mobilize Rudling Kennels...
...into a war dog's training school.
It isn't exactly combat duty.
However, an old soldier accepts any command.
It'll be the duty of Rudling Kennels, sir, to select dogs...
...and pass on their fitness for enlistment.
I should like to see your kennel man, Sam Carraclough.
This is Sam Carraclough.
Morning, gentlemen.
Mr. Carraclough, you're to be in command here.
What?
You have the reputation of being the finest dog man in Yorkshire.
Gentlemen, I have no wish to take credit for something I was born with.
The scoundrel.
Congratulations, Father.
Oh, that's so wonderful,
Mr. Carraclough.
Thank you, miss.
Now, Mr. Carraclough....
Joe!
Joe!
Aren't you going to say goodbye?
You know your grandfather would never approve...
...of us.
And you know how I manage him.
But what does it matter, if you don't love me?
Who said I didn't love you?
Then say it, Joe.
Go on, say it.
Please say it, Joe.
I do love you.
I'll be waiting.
-Goodbye, sir.
-Good day, good day.
Carraclough, it seems from now on, you'll be giving the orders here.
-lt does seem that way.
-There's one thing I insist upon.
-What's that?
-I'm to be second-in-command.
That'll be fine.
I shouldn't dare show my face in the village otherwise.
Carraclough, you must feel free to convert the estate as you think fit.
Thank you. We'll try not to disturb the hydrangeas.
I should think not.
They're the best hydrangea--
Look! Great Scott!
Look what your confounded puppy's done to my hydrangea!
Here, Laddie! Come on, Lassie.
Come on.
Laddie, you get bigger, but you never grow up.
Does he, Lassie?
Here.
Lassie, are you glad we're both grown-up?
There's one thing you don't like about it.
It means you're getting old.
The things I used to do with you
I do with him now.
But thanks for giving him to me anyway.
While you were about it, why didn't you give him some brains?
Perhaps you did at that.
A shoe is more useful than a stick.
Come on, tyke.
This is only for Laddie.
Run on home, old girl.
Hut, two, three, four.
Hut, two, three, four.
All right, Smith, get going.
Get them in line.
Quiet.
Come on, Johnson. Keep moving.
Hut, two, three, four.
Heel.
Quiet.
Heel.
-Two more recruits for us, sir.
-You'll win the war single-handed.
We'll train more dogs than they know what to do with.
Corporal, take these dogs in.
Yes, I have a recruit myself.
You have? And what dog's that?
Laddie, son of Lassie.
Fine, but I thought that boy of yours didn't want him trained.
I talked it over with him last night.
He's on his way to active duty.
And now, with Lassie too old, and the kennel's in the war...
-...I think he sees our point.
-Good for him.
You hear that, Priscilla?
-Young Carraclough's enrolling Laddie.
-Yes, Grandfather, I know all about it.
Well, my boy, you--
You look better than usual.
-Thank you.
-I'm glad to have Laddie join up.
Oh, here's-- Here's his collar.
-Do you think he can do it? The training?
-Put it on him.
Hard discipline teaches it to man and dog.
I don't think you could ever teach it to Laddie.
Here, Joe. You're off for duty, so you'll have no more to do with the dog.
The training will be good for him.
Come along. We'll take him to the field.
-Come on.
-Yes.
The army will make him a champion,
Joe. Come along, Priscilla.
Up!
We find it best to let backward dogs see others leap hurdles successfully.
It makes them want to do as well.
Do you think so, sir?
Well, let me show you.
Come on. Over!
-Hut! Hut!
-Hut! Hut!
Attaboy.
Good fellow.
There you are.
Now, then, Laddie.
Are you ready, huh?
Come along.
Now, then. Come on. Over you go.
He's not very bright.
No. No, he isn't.
Well, at least he's resourceful.
Come along. Bring him out here.
Stop it!
This is a test of courage and a fighting heart.
Like a good soldier, a dog must be steady under fire.
We train dogs in other things...
...but a dog that breaks under fire is unfit for military purposes.
-Now, watch this. All right, let him go.
-Go get him!
Come on, Laddie. Go!
A perfect dog on points who's a perfect fool.
No matter what anyone says, Laddie, you're still the finest champion ever.
May I take Joe away now?
-Go run along, Priscilla.
-With Joe? That's what I came for.
Here, Joe. Here's our picnic.
I'd like to have a word with you, miss.
Oh, Grandfather.
It's pointless to worry the lad.
He's not "the lad. "
He's Sergeant Joe Carraclough.
I intend to worry him as much as I can.
Priscilla, you're distinctly offside.
I'm on Joe's side, Grandfather.
You're not free to be.
You're very old, Grandfather...
...and you think very old things.
You're very young, my dear...
...and you think very young things.
Run along, run along.
If you don't run, you won't catch him.
Good morning, Mr. Carraclough.
Good morning, miss.
I-- I was just taking a little walk.
The bus will be passing here soon.
Laddie, come back here!
Do you think he'll come back when he gets hungry?
I doubt it, miss.
That's where his heart is.
Yes.
And mine.
For the first day, you didn't do badly.
I guess you'll fly with me.
-Thank you.
-Don't thank me.
I could have replaced you, but the boy I'd get would be just as bad.
Say, you wanna see a swell pinup?
Here.
That's Boots. It's the sharpest dog in all of Canada.
He can do everything.
He really smokes that pipe.
-I don't think I'd want my dog to smoke.
-What is your dog?
I have two collies, Lassie and Laddie.
What tricks can they do?
Well, Lassie does some, but Laddie doesn't do any.
-No good, eh?
-Oh, he's a champion.
You mean he's a fighter?
No, not a fighter.
They're both champions.
When the Duke of Rudling owned Lassie...
...she walked from Scotland to England to come home to me.
That's a champion.
That stops you.
Good night, Eddie.
If I'd known you were part of a duke,
I'd never have picked you.
Oh, I'm not. We're cottagers.
It's only the dogs that are champion.
You know, Joe, you're not a bad little kid.
Not very sharp, but not a bad little kid.
Laddie, what are you doing here?
Quiet! Hide him under the covers.
Try not to disturb the men.
He's my dog, sir.
I don't know how he got here.
I remind you that the possession of a dog is an infraction of regulations.
He has no right here.
He's creating confusion.
He's-- He's...
...beautiful, isn't he?
May I have permission to take him home?
He's tired. It's 40 miles from here.
Forty miles?
-Smart dog.
-That's what's so wonderful.
He's never done anything so wonderful.
-And he had better never do it again.
-Yes, sir.
What's this?
That's-- He was sort of enlisted...
...but I don't think it ever quite took.
Right in here, sir.
-That the boy?
-Yeah, that's him.
Father, what are you doing here?
I came for the tyke.
Four hours on the bus.
Well, you'll run away no more, my fine lad.
-Come on. Goodbye, Joe.
-Goodbye.
This is Eddie, the chap
I was telling you about.
-How do you do, sir?
-How do you do?
-Oh, this is the warrant officer.
-How do you do, sir?
Pleasure, I'm sure. Well, goodbye, Joe.
Oh, Father.
Wasn't it clever of him to find me?
I never thought he could do it.
Happen he's Lassie's pup after all.
Well, I must run along.
Goodbye, Father.
Goodbye, Laddie.
-Oh, Eric?
-Yes?
I'm a fool to lend Joe to you.
Last week, I lent you my razor...
-...and I didn't get it back.
-Anything good I don't give back.
-Goodbye. See you in a couple of hours.
-So long, kid.
Take care of him until I get back.
Stay here.
Laddie, come here!
Laddie!
When Carraclough comes back, he can spend a month's pay shipping him home.
Come on, Laddie.
Boy, you sure are stubborn.
Guess you're in love, huh?
Well, he'll be back in a couple of hours.
Just watch for four planes coming home.
Mattie.
What happened to Eric and Joe?
Last time we saw them was over the target. Started lagging behind and....
Better list them as missing.
So you finally coughed your way home.
Y es, Jerry gave us a few. I had to bring her home with one engine.
But I brought your navigator back, so you can use him again tomorrow.
-What'd you do with Laddie?
-I didn't do.
Come on, I'll show you.
Hey, now, Laddie.
Everything's gonna be all right.
You'll have to sleep out here with him.
Can't take him into the barracks.
-Yeah, I suppose I'll have to.
-Sleep well.
We've got a reconnaissance job tomorrow.
I'll be ready.
Oh, look, Joe.
The sergeant major says
Laddie's gotta be shipped home.
But I ran across Jerry Bartlett from our squadron. He's got some leave coming...
...and he'll be going right near your home, so you leave that to me.
-Thanks, Eddie.
-Look, boy...
...you don't have to put on an act for me.
I've seen an air marshal bawl like a baby when he had to leave his dog.
You know something, Laddie?
You've got to understand something before you go home this time.
One of the little things about war is you can't have your dog.
You're a very little thing for me to give up...
...when men are giving up their children.
I suppose when I have a child, the feeling will be something like this.
It probably won't be anything like it.
Perhaps I'll never know about it.
But, anyway, I know about you.
I won't see you anymore.
Photographs of this section of the coast of Norway...
...show us the beginnings of some new kind of activity.
However, all our pictures have been from 35,000 feet.
T oday, we should like to get some from a bit lower. Understand?
-Yes, sir.
-It's dangerous.
There'll be flak, of course.
But it's also important to know exactly what Jerry's doing there.
-Any comments, Eddie?
-No, sir.
That's rather unusual for you.
-Well, that's all. Cheerio.
-Good show.
Cheerio.
Laddie! What are you doing here?
-Laddie ever been in Norway?
-No.
Yes, he has, for the last three minutes.
We're getting close!
Look out, Laddie.
"There'll be flak," he said, and he wasn't kidding.
-Better hit the silk, Joe.
-But what about you?
I'll be right after you. Go ahead.
Hurry up. We're losing altitude. Jump!
Hurry up! I'm right behind you.
-Karl, look! I told you I saw something.
-That's a dog, not a parachute.
He is crazy. There's nothing here.
Maybe there is a name on his collar.
Here's a tag.
Quiet!
He is gone.
An English dog means an English soldier.
Maybe paratroopers are landing in this section.
We'd better get back and report this.
A puppy!
I found a puppy!
Come on, puppy, let's play.
Thea! Arne!
Thea! Arne!
I'll be right back, puppy.
Thea! Thea!
My puppy! My puppy is sick!
My puppy! My brand-new, sick puppy!
You see, come on!
Oh, he always thinks about his dog, the one the Germans shot.
-Here's your puppy.
-And not sick at all. He's just fine, see?
No, no, my new puppy!
-My brand-new, sick puppy!
-This is your puppy.
Look. By the time we get home, it will be all better.
-Come on. Up you go, now.
-I want my puppy!
Now, you stay there and be a good boy.
I forgot my puppy back there!
Henrik, come back! Come back!
I want my puppy!
Henrik, come back! Be a good boy, and you'll get a wonderful puppy...
...all for yourself someday.
Henrik, come back!
Come back, Henrik!
See? Here's my new puppy.
Isn't he pretty?
I told you! He's sick.
His leg is hurt.
Hedda, tear a bandage from your apron.
I'll be spanked if I tear my apron.
Spanking or no spanking,
I'd tear my apron to help a sick dog.
It's easy to talk of tearing aprons when you don't wear any.
Shame on you!
What are you doing?
Here, Thea. Make him well.
There. We'll take care of you.
We'll hide you from the Germans in our cave.
Oh, Arne, make a splint.
You know, the way I showed you when I broke my finger.
-Here's what's left of my lunch.
-Oh, that's a good girl, Hedda.
Oh, look, he's awfully hungry.
He probably hasn't eaten in a long time.
I have no more.
We can save our supper and then feed him tomorrow.
I won't get any supper because
I tore my shirt. But I've got a dog.
-He's my dog.
-He belongs to all of us.
-I found him.
-Well, then you can name him.
-What are you gonna call him?
-Let me see.
-I know!
-Yes?
-No.
-Well, it's getting late.
-Why not call him simply Doggy?
-What name did you say?
She didn't, she said to call him simply Doggy.
I like that.
We'll call him Mr. Simply.
Oh, hello, Mr. Simply.
Mr. Simply's going to sleep.
We'll come back early tomorrow.
Come on.
Happy dreams, Mr. Simply.
I don't think you'll find the poor dog in this village.
He wouldn't stop here.
No refuse bins.
-Why not?
-Because there is no refuse.
Oh, good evening, Mrs. Strohm.
Now, don't hurry on.
It's all right to come in.
Very devout woman, Mrs. Strohm.
You may have noticed her coming here in the evening to pray.
I shall try to find who are dog fanciers among my congregation.
Perhaps they will help.
Of course, when you consider, the only true dog fancier in the world is the flea.
Now!
Come on, Henrik.
Hurry up with that dog.
Come on.
Please, Mr. Simply. Come.
Stop it, Mr. Simply. Stop it!
Please, Mr. Simply. Come,
I've got something nice for you to eat.
Wait a minute.
-Henrik, what are you doing?
-Eat, Mr. Simply.
It's no use, he won't eat. He's been like this ever since he got well.
Eat, Mr. Simply. Please eat.
If you eat, you'll grow up to be a big, strong man.
Stop, now. You're only bothering him.
Besides, dogs don't grow up to be big, strong men.
-Not even if they eat?
-Not even if they drink milk.
Not even if they drink all the milk in the world?
-Not even then.
-Oh, well.
Maybe he doesn't like us anymore.
That's the way he looked when he was hurt.
Maybe he doesn't wanna be our dog.
Don't you?
Don't you want to be our dog?
-Germans!
-Come on, cover up the dog!
Did you hear what they said?
Very suspicious.
That's the first time
I've heard that from Norwegians.
-They are up to something.
-Come here!
-Have you seen a dog?
-Stand still!
Have you seen a dog?
-Well?
-Have we seen a dog?
-A dog?
-No, no dog here.
-What have you got here?
-Wood. We've been gathering firewood.
-What's the matter with him?
-He-- He thinks he's a dog.
He's very young. You know, playing.
He always plays that game.
He barks like this.
No! He barks like this!
No, like this!
All right, all right, go ahead!
What a country.
Stupid people, barking children.
Come on.
Mr. Simply!
Mr. Simply!
Please, God.
Keep Mr. Simply safe from the Germans.
I found him, and I love him.
And I don't want to lose him.
Bring Mr. Simply back.
Please, God, bring him back.
Look!
Halt!
Where did you get this dog?
He is English.
It's not my dog. I never saw him before.
You were here yesterday.
Why are you here again?
I come here every day.
-What about your dog?
-lt isn't my dog.
Look! If it were, it wouldn't run away from me.
You wait here!
Heavenly father, who hearest us always...
...grant these children their prayer for the safety of their dog.
In caring for our little animal brothers...
...these children are educating their hearts in unselfishness.
Preserve their pure hearts.
These children are not asking anything for themselves.
They ask only for the safety of a poor animal.
This love that fills their hearts is your love...
...which I ask shall ever abide in them...
-...and lead them in your footsteps.
-Mr. Simply!
It's a miracle!
Keep these children, as they are now, from selfishness...
...which is the wickedness, the vileness...
...the cruelty of the world.
We ask as always that everything that breathes...
...be preserved from suffering.
-What's in here?
-A storeroom.
-Why is it locked?
-T o keep out thieves.
Air raid!
Come here, Joe.
-This is a fine morning.
-Yes, it is.
I'm sorry to leave you and your wonderful stories about the Vikings.
I make a right liar, Joe.
One thing I told you is the truth.
One Viking alone can smash a platoon of Germans...
...just by standing on them with his two feet.
I believe it, Olav.
If I didn't have to stay here and hide you boys...
...I'd go down and jump on that German army myself to show you how it's done.
You are a good soldier too. I know that, because you are a good companion.
I'm afraid I've been talking mostly about my dog.
I know it's my duty to get back to England into the fight again...
...but it's not easy to leave Laddie behind.
I keep thinking about finding him.
Sometimes I even wake up at night and think I can hear him barking.
After what you and your friends have faced, I suppose I sound rather silly.
No, you're not silly.
It isn't silly to have something dear to your heart and to talk about it.
A man who lives for himself is very empty.
The others, they talk about their girls, their wives and children.
You talk about your dog, because you love him.
Now, remember, hide by day and travel by night.
And don't try to contact the underground. They'll find you.
Operator MCS will take you down to the coast.
When you get to the high cliffs, you can see Anton's house and his fishing boat.
Anton will contact the British intelligence.
Another soldier goes home to fight.
Goodbye, Olav.
-Goodbye.
-And thank you.
Well....
So you are Laddie, huh?
I've heard a lot about you...
...but I never thought
I was going to see you.
You are a long way from the duke's hydrangeas now, aren't you?
Well...
...you'll go back to England and dig up those hydrangeas again.
The duke will be so glad to see you...
...that he'll grow some new ones just for you.
MCS calling number 44.
MCS calling number 44.
Dangerous enemy activity along coast.
Cannot pass anyone now.
Flier returning to you until further notice from us.
You' re going to see him again.
He's coming back.
This is a wonderful day.
This is a reunion arranged by the gods...
...and only they and I shall see it.
You know, it should be Christmas.
We should have an evergreen tree over in that corner...
...and you should be under it.
I should have a big, fat belly and a long, white beard.
I believe you already know that he's coming, huh?
What? Is he here already?
Be quiet.
Those are men of pain, torture and killing.
A shame to tell a good animal this is what men have come to.
Maybe they will pass us by, and maybe they won't.
Be quiet.
Good day.
It's a cold one.
I'll stir up the fire.
Are you Olav Grieber?
-Yes.
-You live here alone?
Unfortunately.
The women I would like to marry won't live up here...
...and the women who would live up here, I wouldn't like to marry.
Do you have a radio?
No.
That's forbidden, isn't it?
No one's here. You're wasting your time and good shoe leather.
March out.
Where are you taking me?
The prison camp.
You're coming with us.
You won't need your cabin.
Besides, there's no one in there.
That's the truth, isn't it?
-Yes, that's the truth.
-No British soldiers?
No. Why do you ask me that?
Because we have caught one, and he came from this mountain.
Your hut won't shelter any more British.
No, wait!
The first I've seen in a whole year.
Hello, boy. Hello, chum.
-He understands.
-I believe it's a Britisher.
Ought to know better than to hang around here.
Go on, or we be finding you in a stew.
-A dog? What kind of dog?
-It's a collie. He's a beauty.
Oh, let me touch him.
Hello, boy. Hello, then.
Yes, it's good to meet you too.
Move back from the fence! Separate!
-Let him in, won't you?
-He's going to shoot him.
-No!
-Lower your gun!
It's Sergeant Schmidt.
Couldn't we have him in?
He'd be no trouble, I promise.
I could teach him to lead me, and then I could work and be some use.
Let the dog enter.
-Oh, you are a sweetheart.
-You are a little beauty.
Look, he's got a collar.
-"War dogs. "
-War dogs?
-What is he doing over here?
-You're a long way from home.
Here. That dog needs water and food. There.
Let him lead you, prisoner.
Thanks, sergeant.
That's decent of you.
I'll take him for a drink of water.
And at mess, he can share my rations.
Come on.
Clever fellow. How did you know it was my clothes peg?
This isn't mine.
I wonder whose--
Carraclough.
-Go to your quarters.
-You promised I should have him.
Go!
You stay here.
He's an English collie, and he came direct to that escaped prisoner's towel.
You think that poor-looking animal can follow the prisoner's scent...
...when your own trained dogs couldn't?
My dogs couldn't because the scent was overlapped by so many others.
But this dog knows only his master in this country.
You can see by his condition what he has been through.
He'll follow his single trail no matter who has crossed it.
Lower your tone, sergeant.
Any moment, I expect you to bark like a dog.
-Y es, sir.
-As a soldier, Schmidt...
...you're a comedian.
You're not a man, you're a clown.
And asking me for orders to trot all over Norway...
...with this bag of bones here to pursue a prisoner...
...is the culmination of your dog obsession.
-He's following the scent. You see?
-Quiet.
Don't bark.
Proceed, comedian. It will be pleasant not to have my eyes revolted...
...by that gargoyle shape in the uniform of our great army.
There. Y es, you're a good dog, a fine dog.
Here, here, there's nothing to be afraid of.
We're friends. Good friends, ja?
Now, you go ahead. Go ahead.
Ja, that's right, you want out.
Come on.
Come on. We'll go out too.
Olav certainly didn't exaggerate how kind you'd be to me.
I can't thank you enough,
Joanna, Anton.
When you are safe in England...
...send us a message through the underground. That's enough.
And when the war is over, we meet again, eh?
You both must come to England to meet my father.
He will not make us sleep in the cellar, eh?
Nothing but the best bedroom.
So young.
Take care of yourself.
You are still not strong.
It won't be easy for you to manage the boat on your own...
...even though it is a little one.
Anything bigger would be hard to hide from them.
But with luck, you should make it.
You know, you are very lucky...
...the British intelligence contacted a submarine.
-But you must be sure to--
-I'll be there at midnight. Don't worry.
Look.
Careful. Don't panic.
You know what to do and say.
You. Your papers.
Yours.
I'm sorry. He's not very....
Your papers!
Come. Both of you.
-Where to?
-You will see.
But we're just setting out for work.
We are fishermen. You saw our permits.
My husband is the only man in the district with a permit to fish.
-lf he does not go out, we shall starve.
-Too bad.
-But the tide is high now.
-lt'll be high again tonight and tomorrow.
Come.
-Don't worry, we will be all right.
-Anton.
We will be back tonight.
Won't we, Peter, old man?
All right, get to work.
This is too much, digging German fortifications.
Good practice for digging their graves.
Won't be long before the day of reckoning.
All right, get on the job!
-What is it?
-Look!
-It's Laddie! He's found me!
-Don't stop.
Keep digging. Whatever you do, you must not give yourself away.
-He's my dog.
-When the dog comes close to you...
-...kick him away from you. Beat him.
-Stop talking. Work.
I'm sure he's somewhere in the camp.
Probably posing as one of those workmen.
-Say "sir" when you address me, soldier.
-Sir.
What do you expect me to do?
Stop the work of the German army while you examine every man's papers?
That will not be necessary, sir.
With your permission....
Good dog.
Find him. Find your master.
-That's a fine dog.
-Come here.
I wonder what he's doing here.
There's a beautiful dog.
Evidently, the dog is owned by a corporation.
Everybody, quiet! Get back to work!
-Here, boy. Here, boy.
-Here! Stop that!
So the dog has found his master.
That's right, you found me.
I'm Joe Carraclough.
Come out of there!
Walk ahead, prisoner.
Where are you taking us?
Back to the prison from which you escaped. Let me warn you:
Any funny business, and I won't hesitate to kill.
I'm sure you won't.
You may be very sure.
Here, Laddie. Go get it.
He can't even retrieve a stick.
Your dog is a hopeless fool, and so are you.
Why didn't you kick him away from you?
If you kicked him, I would've believed you weren't the man I wanted.
That commanding officer thought I needed a guard to help me.
I alone found you, and I alone will take you in.
The high command may even hear of this exploit.
Turn around!
I ought to make you walk backward.
Then you'll pay attention to what I say!
And if I don't?
You are not wearing your uniform.
I can shoot you as a spy or for any reason that I choose.
Now, turn around!
And march!
I am in command here.
What I say is so.
You are not a soldier, you're a comedian.
-You are not a man, you are a clown.
-You may be right.
A clown is all you could capture.
Because you wouldn't hit the dog, you're a better man?
-I know I am.
-We shall see.
There are many ways in this world to judge the better man...
...but I know only one way!
The better man is the man who lives!
Come on, Laddie.
Come on, boy.
If he should live through those rapids, post a guard at the fisherman's house.
All right, Laddie.
In we go.
Lights are forbidden.
I'm sorry, I forgot.
What's that?
It is nothing but the tide.
Do you have to stand guard here all night?
It's orders.
Come in.
I'll give you some food.
-Good morning.
-Oh, excuse me.
Oh, no, please.
So you come here too?
It's a champion thing to do, sitting here looking out across the moors.
Joe always felt that too.
If I wanted to find him,
'tis here I'd look.
Some of our lads coming home.
There's nothing to bark at, Lassie.
I'd not be too sure, miss.
Things speak to her that don't speak to us.
Her ABC's are the stars, the wind and the rain and the scent...
...and all things that move with them.
If those were our ABC's, then we'd know what she knows.
Come on. Come on, Laddie.
Come on.
Oh, yes, there.
There, there.
Oh, yes, there.
Hey, Lass. Our lads have come home.
There, there.
Oh, yes, there.

For the grocer, another group of coins...
...for Katrin's shoes to be half-soled.
And Mama would count out the silver.
At last, Papa would ask, "Is all?"
Mama would look up then and smile.
"Is good," she'd murmur.
"We do not have to go to the bank."
The end.
"A novel by Kathryn Hanson."
"For as long as I could remember, the house on the Larkin Street hill...
...had been home.
Papa and Mama had both been born in Norway...
...but they came to San Francisco because Mama's sisters were here.
All of us were born here.
Nels, the oldest and the only boy, my sister Christine...
...and the littlest sister, Dagmar."
But first and foremost...
...I remember Mama.
I remember that every Saturday night...
...I would sit at my desk by the attic window...
...and write down in my diary all my innermost thoughts.
Mama would call out to me from downstairs.
- Katrin?
- Yes, Mama?
Katrin, come. We're waiting.
Yes, Mama. I'm coming.
It was like a weekly ritual, those Saturday nights...
...for I remember how Mama would sit down at the kitchen table...
...and count out the money that Papa had brought home in the little envelope.
Katrin?
Yes, Mama.
Papa called. I called two times before you answer.
I'm sorry, Mama. I was writing.
Christine, you wish to laugh, please to laugh. No just:
Yes, Mama.
So now all are here.
Yeah, come then.
First, for the landlord.
- For the landlord.
- For the landlord.
For the landlord.
Yeah.
For the grocer.
- For the grocer.
- For the grocer.
In all the U.S., no cat was as brave as Elizabeth.
In all the world, no cat was as brave as Elizabeth.
Dagmar, put Elizabeth onto the back porch.
In heaven or hell, no cat was as brave as Elizabeth.
For Katrin's shoes to be half-soled.
- Katrin's shoes.
- My shoes.
Katrin's old shoes.
For Katrin's shoes.
Mama, teacher says, this week,
I'll need a new notebook.
- How much it will be?
- It's a dime.
For the notebook.
It's five. Eight. Three.
- You don't lose it.
- I won't lose it.
- You look out when you blow your nose.
- I'll look out.
Is all, Mama?
Yeah.
Yeah, is all for this week.
Is good. We do not have to go to the bank.
Mama. Mama, I'll be graduating from valley school next month.
- Yeah.
- Could I go on to high, you think?
- You want to go to high school?
- Well, I'd like to very much...
...if you think I could.
Is good.
It'll cost a little money.
Here, I've got it all written down.
Books, carfare...
- Will you get the little bank, Katrin?
- Yes, Mama.
The little bank.
That was the most important thing in the whole house.
It was a box we used to keep for emergencies.
The things that came out of the little bank.
Mama was always going to buy herself a warm coat, when there was enough...
...only there never was.
It's all there, Mama.
Carfare, clothes, notebooks...
...all things I really need.
I talked it over with Cy Nichols.
- He went to high last year.
- Is good.
Now we see.
Is there enough there, Mama?
Well, is not much in the little bank right now.
We give to the dentist, you remember, and for your roller skates.
I know, and there's a warm coat you've been saving for.
Well, the coat we can get another time, but even so, l...
You mean Nels can't go to high?
Well, is not enough here. We do not want to have to go to the bank, do we?
No, Mama, no.
I could work in Dillon's grocery after school.
Yeah?
Is not enough.
No, is not enough.
I'll stop the smoking.
I'll give up the tobacco.
Well, I...
I could mind the Maxwell children
Friday night.
Katrin could help me.
Is good. Is enough.
We do not have to go to the bank.
- Gee.
- Good.
If that's the aunts,
I'm going to my boudoir.
- I'm going to my study.
- No. You mustn't run away.
- Why, Trina.
- Trina, yeah, and all by herself.
- Say good evening to Aunt Trina, children.
- Good evening, Aunt Trina.
Good evening, children.
- How well they all look.
- You have a feather boa?
Is new? Beautiful!
- It was a present.
- A present? Lars, look.
- Trina has a present.
- Yes. Is... Is fine.
Jenny and Sigrid don't come with you, Trina?
No. I didn't tell them I was coming.
- I want to talk to you, Martha.
- Well, come in, then.
Sit, and we talk.
- Could we talk alone?
- Alone?
If you wouldn't mind.
Children, you leave us alone a little.
I call you.
Dagmar, you go with Katrin.
Trina, what is it?
Oh, no. No, I can't say it.
Why, Trina, what is it?
It's something very personal.
No, Lars, you stay here.
We go out on front porch.
I like a breath of air. You smoke your pipe.
Be comfortable.
So, Trina, now, what is?
Martha, I want to get married.
You mean, you want to get married, or there's someone you want to marry?
- Oh, there's someone I want to marry.
- Does he want to marry you?
He says he does.
- Trina, is wonderful.
- I think it is.
Who is?
- Mr. Thorkelson.
- From the funeral parlor.
Yeah. I know he isn't very handsome...
...and it isn't exactly what most people think a very nice profession, but...
- You love him, Trina?
- Yeah.
Then is good.
Martha...
- Martha.
- Yeah?
Will you help me tell the others?
- Jenny and Sigrid, they do not know?
- No. I was afraid they laugh at me...
...but if you tell them...
- Jenny will not like you tell me first.
Well, I can't help that. You've got to tell them not to laugh at me.
If they laugh at me,
I'll jump in the bay.
Jenny and Sigrid will not laugh, Trina.
- I promise you that.
- Oh, thank you, Martha.
Come now.
And Uncle Chris?
Will you talk to him?
Well, it is Mr. Thorkelson who must talk to Uncle Chris.
Always it is husband who must talk to the head of the family.
Yes, I know that, but Uncle Chris is very frightening.
He's so big and black, and he shouts so...
...and Mr. Thorkelson is kind of timid, really.
But Trina, if he's to be your husband...
...he must learn not to be timid.
You do not want husband should be timid.
You are timid. Is not good when both are timid.
No. Jenny and Sigrid I talk to...
...but Mr. Thorkelson must go to Uncle Chris.
Martha, look. Is Jenny and Sigrid now.
I see Jenny and Sigrid first.
You go into my bedroom.
Wait there till I call you.
Lars, Jenny and Sigrid come.
No, no, I like you stay a little.
Wait!
Oh, wait, Jenny. I must get my breath.
- This hill kills me every time I climb it.
- You climb bigger hills than that...
...in the old country.
- Well, I was a girl in the old country.
- Hello, Martha.
- Jenny, Sigrid, Arne.
- Is surprise.
- Good evening, Aunt Martha.
Good evening, Arne.
- Has Trina been here?
- Trina?
She's gone somewhere, and she doesn't know anyone but you.
That is what you think.
Give Lars your coat.
I give you some coffee...
...then we talk about Trina.
Arne, the children are upstairs.
That's good, Aunt Martha.
- Can I play with this, Aunt Martha?
- Yeah, sure, Arne, but you don't break it.
- Trina has been here.
- Yeah, she has been here.
- What did Trina want?
- She want to talk to me.
What about?
Marriage.
- What?
- Trina wants to get married.
Who'd want to marry Trina?
Mr. Thorkelson.
- Peter Thorkelson?
- Yeah.
Timid Peter? She'd be the laughingstock.
Jenny.
Jen...! Sigrid!
Trina is here.
She will come in in a minute.
This is serious for her.
- You will not laugh at her.
- I shall do what I please.
No, Jenny. You will not.
- And why won't I?
- Because I will not let you.
- And how will you stop me?
- Lf you laugh at Trina...
...I will tell of the time before your wedding...
...when your husband tried to run away.
- What is that?
- Who told you that?
I know.
Erik tried to run away?
- It is not true.
- Then you do not mind if I tell Trina?
Uncle Chris told you.
Tried to run away?
It does not matter, Sigrid.
Jenny will not laugh at Trina, no.
Nor will you.
For if you laugh at her, I will tell of your wedding night with Ole...
...when you cry all the time, and he bring you home to mother.
- That I did not know.
- Is no need you should know.
I do not tell these stories for spite...
...only so they do not laugh at Trina.
You go call her now, Lars.
Come have some coffee. Jenny. Sigrid.
- Trina!
- Yeah, I'm coming.
Oh, I beg your pardon. I was not aware...
Oh, Mr. Hyde, these are my sisters.
- Pleased to meet you.
- Madame. Madame.
The three Graces.
- I shall be in my room.
- Yeah, sure, Mr. Hyde.
- Has he paid you his rent yet?
- Well, is hard to ask. Surely he'll pay soon.
Surely he won't. If Martha thinks she'll get the warm coat she always talks about...
...out of that old broken-down actor...
- Jenny, Mr. Hyde is a gentleman.
He reads to us loud wonderful books.
Longfellow and Charles Dickens and Fenimore Kipling.
Oh, come. Come in, Trina.
Come. Coffee's getting cold.
- I tell them.
- Why did you come to Martha first?
She think maybe
Martha would understand.
Maybe Mr. Thorkelson thinks she will have dowry...
...like the girls in the old country.
- Sigrid.
Well, why shouldn't I?
You all had dowries.
We were married in Norway, and our parents were alive.
Where would your dowry come from, I'd like to know?
- Uncle Chris. He's head of the family.
- And who will ask him?
He won't need asking when Mr. Thorkelson...
Uncle Chris will eat him.
Timid Peter and Uncle Chris.
Maybe Uncle Chris will tell him some family stories.
He knows many, does Uncle Chris.
- Where are the children?
- Yes, aren't we going to see them?
Yeah, sure. I'll call them.
- Children! Your aunts are leaving!
- Coming, Papa.
I help with the coffee things.
Is all right.
Here they come.
Good evening, Aunt Jenny, Aunt Sigrid.
Good evening. Where have you all been hiding yourselves?
- Good evening, Nels.
- Good evening.
My, my, my, how tall he's getting.
Yeah, he's almost as tall as his Papa.
Looks to me as if he's outgrowing his strength.
Dagmar is looking pale too.
Oh, my goodness!
What an awful-looking cat!
- She follows Dagmar everywhere.
- Next, she'll have it sleeping with her.
Don't you know a cat draws breath from a sleeping child?
You wouldn't want to wake up smothered, would you?
Elizabeth can have all my breath.
- There.
- Elizabeth.
- What a very silly name for a cat.
- It's a very silly name for that cat.
- That cat's a tom...
- Nels, you do not need to say it.
She better think up a new name.
He's Elizabeth, and he's gonna stay Elizabeth.
Well, maybe you would call him
Uncle Elizabeth.
Uncle Elizabeth?
- Elizabeth, do you hear?
- Goodbye, all.
- Come on, sweetheart.
- You're called Uncle Elizabeth now.
Nels, go tell Mr. Hyde we're ready for the reading.
You mind what I say, Martha.
It'd be a great pity if a boarder put something over on a Norwegian woman.
Would be great pity if boarder put something over on San Francisco woman.
You talk as if San Francisco were the world.
Yeah, is my world.
Goodbye, Jenny, Sigrid.
- Goodbye, Martha.
- Goodbye, Aunt Martha.
Goodbye, Arne, sweetheart.
Oh, Mr. Hyde, this is my sister Trina.
Enchanted.
Mr. Hyde reads to us tonight the Tales From Two Cities.
It's a beautiful story, but sad.
I like sad stories.
I should like to finish this tonight.
Is good.
- Are you ready?
- Yes, please, Mr. Hyde.
Yeah, Mr. Hyde.
"In the black prison of the Conciergerie...
...the doomed of the day awaited their fate.
They were in numbers the weeks of the year.
Fifty-two were to roll that afternoon on the life-tide of the city...
...to the boundless everlasting sea."
I don't think I shall ever forget that night.
It was almost midnight when he came to the end...
...and none of us had noticed.
"It is a far, far better thing I do...
...than I have ever done.
It is a far, far better rest I go to...
...than I have ever known."
The end.
There were many nights
I couldn't sleep...
...for the way Mr. Hyde had set my imagination dancing.
I wrote in my diary, "What a wonderful thing is literature...
...transporting us to realms unknown. "
"His voice sank almost to a whisper as he answered."
"'Mr. Holmes, they were the footprints...
...of a gigantic hound."'
To be continued in our next.
- Lf you're interested.
- Oh, yes, Mr. Hyde.
If we were interested? You couldn't have kept us from it.
It meant a lot to Mama too, because Nels stopped going nights...
...to the street corner to hang about with the neighborhood boys.
The night they broke into Mr. Dillon's store...
...Nels was home with us.
This above all: to thine own self be true.
And it must follow, as the night the day...
...thou canst not then be false to any man.
The more Mr. Hyde read, the more I realized...
...that the one thing I really wanted in all the world was to become a writer.
I did write a piece once about Mama's Uncle Chris...
...but my schoolteacher said it wasn't nice to write...
...about a member of one's own family.
Once or twice a year...
...our Uncle Chris, with his great, loud voice...
...with his fierce black mustache...
...would come down from his ranch in the north...
...and descend upon San Francisco in his automobile.
We knew that from the time he roared off the ferry...
...and charged up Market Street to get a good run up the hill...
...our quiet way of life was due for a change.
Uncle Chris.
Uncle Chris.
We children didn't talk much about him...
...but Mama used to say that the reason
Uncle Chris drove so fast...
...was that it gave him a feeling of freedom denied him when he walked.
For Uncle Chris limped badly because of an accident back in the old country.
Martha!
Lars! Children, where are you?
Martha! Lars!
Well, hey, there is nobody home?
I say, is nobody home?
So, what is?
You do not answer me?
You do not hear me calling?
I say, you do not hear me calling?
I do not call loud enough?
Christine!
Yes, Uncle Chris.
Katrin!
Nels.
Yes, Uncle Chris.
Which yes? Yes, you do not hear me, or yes, I do not call loud enough?
- We heard you, Uncle Chris.
- Well, then why you do not come?
We were coming.
Come, let me look at you.
Stand tall.
Where the marks are.
Two inches.
Two inches in six months is good! Good!
Good!
Christine.
Show me your teeth.
You brush them good?
Nels, there's a box of oranges in the automobile. You fetch them in.
Where is the little one? Dagmar?
- She's sick, Uncle Chris.
- Sick? What is the matter with her?
It's her ear. She's had an earache for two days. A bad earache.
- Mama sent for the doctor.
- Good doctor? What he say?
- He's in there now.
- Oh, I go in.
Uncle Chris.
- How is with Dagmar?
- Is not good.
- Doctor, this is my uncle, Mr. Halvorsen.
- How do you do, sir?
What is with the child?
We must get her to a hospital at once.
We'll have to operate.
- Operate?
- I'm afraid so.
Can wait till my husband come home from work?
I'm afraid not. Her condition requires an immediate operation.
We go.
- What is with the child?
- It's a mastoid.
Oh, well, then you operate immediately.
- I believe that's what I said.
- Immediately.
Dr. Johnson.
Doctor, is enough?
Frankly, I was thinking of the county hospital.
No. No, we pay. But is enough?
If there isn't, we can go to the bank.
We have a bank account.
Well, is enough without we go to the bank, doctor?
My husband is carpenter.
Make good money.
If there is need of money, I pay.
It'll be all right. We'll take her to the clinic.
- You pay what you can afford.
- Good.
I have patient there already.
My nephew Arne.
They operate this morning on his knee.
Are you a physician, sir?
I'm better physician than most doctors.
Nels, here, my other nephew, he become doctor when he grow up.
Indeed.
Very interesting.
If you'll have the child at the clinic in...
...shall we say an hour's time?
- The child will be there in 1 0 minutes.
I have my automobile.
I can hardly make arrangements in 1 0 minutes.
Well, I make arrangements.
I know doctors.
Uncle Chris, Dr. Johnson arrange.
He is good doctor.
Thank you, madam.
- Doctor, you go. We come.
- Very well. In an hour, then.
Dagmar will be well taken care of.
I promise you. I will operate myself.
- I watch.
- You'll do no such thing, sir.
Always I watch operation.
I'm head of family.
I allow no one to attend my operations.
Are so bad?
- I go see Dagmar.
- Uncle Chris.
Is kind of you, but Dagmar's sick.
You frighten her.
- I frighten her?
- Yeah, Uncle Chris, you frighten everyone.
- I?
- Yeah, everyone but me.
Even the girls, Jenny, Sigrid, Trina, are frightened of you.
- The girls. Women.
- And the children too.
So Nels and I get Dagmar, you drive us to the hospital in your automobile...
...but you do not frighten Dagmar, and you leave doctor alone.
Dr. Johnson is fine doctor.
Nels, you come with me.
Help me carry Dagmar.
You remember.
Is true I frighten you, huh?
Christine, Katrin, you are frightened of me?
Now, come, I ask you, tell me the truth.
You are frightened of me?
- A little, Uncle Chris.
- Oh, no.
Are you, Christine?
- Yes, Uncle Chris.
- But why?
What is there to be frightened of?
I'm your Uncle Chris.
Why do I frighten you?
I don't know.
Is bad. Very bad.
The aunts, yes, I like to frighten them.
What? That makes you laugh?
You do not like the aunts?
Now, come, tell me.
You do not like the aunts? Now say.
Not very much, Uncle Chris.
And which do you not like the most?
Jenny, Sigrid or Trina? Tell me.
I think I like Aunt Jenny the least.
She's so bossy.
I can't stand Aunt Sigrid.
Always whining and complaining.
Sigrid, whining.
Jenny, bossy. Is true!
Uncle Chris, black. I'll say he's black.
Black in his heart.
- Cursing and swearing.
- He is good to the children.
He's good to his bottles.
And that woman he lives with.
- His housekeeper?
- His housekeeper?
Oh, there's Peter, waiting. Right on time!
Yoo-hoo, Peter! Yoo-hoo!
Peter, I'm so glad you weren't tied down to your business.
As a matter of fact, I was just waiting...
An undertaker's business can always wait.
Now's a fine chance to ask
Uncle Chris for a dowry.
You must be very firm, Mr. Thorkelson.
Yes, ma'am. Very firm, indeed.
Fare, please.
Tell him, Sigrid. Tell Mr. Thorkelson what Uncle Chris has just done.
Well, you know my little Arne's knee...
...that fall he had two month ago.
- Yeah.
The man at the drugstore said it was only a bruise.
But this morning, when I left home to do the marketing...
...who should turn up but Uncle Chris.
But you must not tell your mama that we talk of them so.
Is secret for us.
Now you cannot be frightened anymore when we have secret.
Come.
I tell you my secret too.
I do not like the aunts.
Oh, Jenny, do you see what I see?
- That woman in his automobile.
- How shameful.
- Is the woman his wife?
- Yeah.
And no.
Uncle Chris.
Sigrid has something to say to you.
Uncle Chris.
- You took Arne to the hospital.
- Sure, I take Arne to the hospital.
Now we take Dagmar to the hospital, so do not clutter up the place.
This is some more of Uncle Chris' doings.
Sigrid, you're a whining old fool, and you get out of here.
No. There has been enough of these high-handed goings-on.
Jenny, you're a bossy old fool.
And you get out of here too.
And we take Dagmar to the hospital.
- You got her good, Nels?
- Yeah.
- Well, we go.
- No, you're going to listen to Sigrid.
Sigrid, if you do not get out of the way of that door before I count three...
...I throw you out. And Jenny too, as big as she is.
One...
...two...
Put her in the back of the car.
Uncle Chris.
I want to introduce Mr. Thorkelson.
I want you to meet Mr. Thorkelson.
Uncle Chris, I want you to meet
Mr. Thorkelson.
This is Mr. Thorkelson.
He wants to say...
Martha!
We go.
He wants to...
Jenny, Sigrid, we go to hospital.
You be good children till Mama comes home.
Yes, Mama.
Yeah, I come.
There's milk in the cooler and fruit and cookies for your lunch.
We'll be all right, Mama. Don't worry.
I go now.
Oh, Martha. You can't go in his automobile.
- Why not?
- Martha.
- Yeah, I come.
- We go.
Because she is in it. The woman.
So it will kill me or Dagmar to sit in automobile with her?
I have see her. She looks nice woman.
Mama.
Uncle Chris!
Mr. Thorkelson.
Mr. Thorkelson.
Thorkelson, come, come.
Mama.
But Uncle Chris,
I tell you, I must see him.
You do not understand English?
No visitors for 24 hours.
- But you have see him.
- I am no visitor.
- I'm exception.
- Then his mama should be exception too.
I will see the doctor.
I seen doctor. I told him you are not good for Arne.
Not good for my own son?
No. Not good at all.
You cry over him. I go now.
Uncle Chris! Uncle Chris,
I must speak to you.
- I have business.
- Uncle Chris, please.
- I wanna get married.
- Well, then get married.
Wait!
Wait, Uncle Chris.
I want to marry Mr. Thorkelson.
Here.
Peter, this is Uncle Chris.
Uncle Chris, this is Mr. Thorkelson.
- So?
- How are you, sir?
- Busy.
- Please, Uncle Chris.
You want to marry him, marry him.
I have other things to think about.
- Then you give your permission?
- Sure, I do.
If you want to make a fool of yourself,
I can't stop you.
Thank you, Uncle Chris!
- So is all?
- Yeah, I think is all.
No!
No?
Well, there was a little something else.
You see...
Well, Trina mentioned that in the old country...
...it was... It was always usual, and...
Well, after all, we are all from the old country.
Well, that's how it is. That's how it is.
Well, sir, what is? What do you want?
Well, it was a question...
A question of Trina's...
Well, not to mince matters...
...her dowry.
- Her what?
- Dowry.
Her dowry! Oh, so Trina wants dowry.
- She's 42 years old!
- No, Uncle Chris!
Husband's not enough, she wants dowry?
Please! This is a hospital, not a marriage bureau.
Come with me into waiting room.
I talk to you about dowry.
So did you hear that, Martha?
- What?
- Uncle Chris.
No, I do not hear.
I wait for doctor.
Is two hours since they take Dagmar to operating room.
More.
Who gives dowry?
Parents.
Why? Because they are so glad they don't have to support...
...their daughter anymore, they pay money.
I do not support Trina. Why then should
I pay money to have her married?
- I don't know.
- You don't know?
You think I let Trina marry a man who won't take her without dowry?
- I never thought of it like that.
- What kind of a man would that be?
Well, not a very nice kind of a man.
- Well, are you that kind of a man?
- No, I don't think so.
- Well, then you don't want dowry.
- No, I don't suppose I do.
Good.
We'll go next door and have some coffee.
Sigrid, do you have money?
- Yeah, I have little.
- Good, then I treat you.
We'll be next door if you want us, Martha.
Yeah.
- Mrs. Hanson.
- Doctor.
Dagmar's fine. She came through beautifully.
- She's in bed sleeping off the anesthetic.
- Thank you, doctor.
- You're very welcome.
- Is good of you, doctor.
I go to her now.
Oh, Mrs. Hanson.
I'm very sorry.
You see, it's against the rules.
But you shall see her tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
But, doctor, I promise her.
She's so little, she'll be frightened when she wakes if I do not keep my promise.
The nurses will take excellent care of her. Excellent care.
Now, you mustn't worry.
For the first 24 hours, the clinic patients are not permitted to have visitors.
The wards must be kept very quiet.
I would not make a sound.
I'm very sorry.
Tomorrow.
Nels.
- Sir?
- Tomorrow.
But, doctor...
Just a minute.
Whom did you wish to see?
Please, where I can find my daughter?
- What name?
- Dagmar.
- Dagmar Hanson.
- I'm afraid you can't see her today.
No visitors for the first 24 hours.
Oh, but I'm not visitor. I'm her mama.
I'm sorry, but it's against the rules.
- Just one minute, please.
- I'm sorry, but it's against the rules.
Mama.
You can see her tomorrow. They said so.
But I promise her.
What can I tell Papa tonight?
The nurses will look after her.
Do you wanna go next door for some coffee?
No, we go home. We have coffee home.
Where are the girls?
Shall I make you some coffee?
You said you'd have some when you got home.
Later.
First I have to think.
I wish you wouldn't worry like this.
Dagmar's all right.
You know she's all right.
Is everything all right, Mama?
Yeah, is all right.
- You have eaten?
- Yes, Mama.
You drink your milk?
- Yes, Mama.
- Yeah, is good.
Mama, is there something the matter?
Mama, Dagmar isn't...
She's not... Mama.
No, no. Dagmar's fine.
Always so dramatic.
Two hours till Papa come home.
Nels, what is it?
There is something the matter.
They wouldn't let Mama see Dagmar.
It's a rule of the hospital.
And Mama's very worried.
She was talking to me in Norwegian on the streetcar.
- What are we going to do?
- Don't make a tragedy out of it.
Chris how can you be so callous? Can't you see that Mama's heart is breaking?
You're always trying to make everything so dramatic.
You only make things worse for Mama.
Well, it is dramatic.
- People's hearts don't actually break.
- They do.
Only in books.
Mama.
What are you going to do?
Scrub the floor.
But, Mama, you scrubbed the floor yesterday.
Yeah, well, I scrub it again.
But, Mama.
Comes a time when you got to get down on your knees.
Now will you believe me?
Mama, I wish you wouldn't do this.
You must be tired.
Let her alone, Nels.
Mama.
Mama.
What is it, Mama?
What is it?
I think of something.
I think I think of something.
"And drank real dew out of a crystal goblet.
And helped the stars to play peekaboo."
Uncle Chris?
- Yes, Arne?
- Does it have to hurt like this?
If you want it to be well...
...and not walk always like Uncle Chris, it does, for little.
Arne, the doctor give you something...
...to make you go to sleep.
So maybe if you don't think of pain, you go to sleep.
Is very bad?
It is, kind of.
Arne?
Don't you know any swear words?
What?
Don't you know any swear words?
No, Uncle Chris. Not real ones.
Well, then I tell you two fine ones...
...you use when pain comes again.
I tell you Norwegian swear word.
Is better.
When pain comes again, you say "dum geit."
It help plenty.
I know. I have pain too.
I say it all the time.
And if pain is very bad...
...you say "dum geit!"
Just like that. Dum geit!
But only if is very bad.
Is bad now?
No, it's a little better, Uncle Chris.
You like I sing some more?
I don't mind.
But maybe something a little, well, quieter.
Sure, sure.
Good!
- It help, huh?
- Is good!
Then you sleep some.
That's terrible. Teaching a child to swear.
You don't know what "dum geit" means, eh?
Do I look like a foreigner?
If you were, you would know that "dum geit" in Norwegian means:
"Stupid old goat."
Is different one.
You're working late, aren't you?
The floors need cleaning.
I'm glad they finally decided to clean them.
Yeah.
Mama.
Mama.
Mama.
Mama.
Mama.
Dagmar.
Is Mama, Dagmar.
Mama.
There's no fever.
Is good.
Where you been? You promised.
Well, yeah, yeah, I promised. I come.
I was worried.
Oh, well, no.
Mama's here now.
Yeah, you go to sleep now.
Sleep.
Sleep.
I don't think I can ever remember seeing Mama unoccupied.
Her work was never done.
She was always so busy that it wasn't very often...
...I could get her to talk about herself or her life in the old country.
I do remember one time, though, and I felt very proud.
For Mama talked to me just as if
I were a grown-up person.
It was the day before Dagmar came home from the hospital.
This one's coffee-flavored.
Yeah, mine also.
Mama, when can I drink coffee?
- When you're grown up.
- When I'm 1 8?
Oh, maybe before that.
When I graduate?
Maybe. Comes the day you are grown up, Papa and I will know.
Oh, Mama, aren't they beautiful?
Don't you just love flowers?
You like we buy some?
Oh, Mama, can we afford it?
I think for Dagmar's coming home tomorrow.
We like some violets, please.
Ten cents violets, please.
Wonderful.
Oh, ladies.
- Thank you, ladies.
- Well, thank you.
Mama, he called us "ladies."
Oh, Mama, when I'm rich and famous,
I'm gonna have fresh flowers every day.
I'll buy you just lovely clothes.
White satin gowns with long trains to them. And jewelry.
- I'll buy you a pearl necklace.
- Better I like my solje.
But, Mama, wouldn't you like to be rich?
I would like to be rich the way
I would like to be 1 0 feet high.
Is good for some things, bad for others.
But didn't you come to America to get rich?
No, we come to America because they are all here.
All the others. Is good for families to be together.
- And did you like it right away?
- Yeah, right away.
When we get off the ferry boat and I see San Francisco...
...and all the family, I say,
"Is like Norway."
And then you're all born here, and I become American citizen.
Mama, do you ever want to go back to the old country?
Well, I like to go back once to look, maybe.
To see the mountains and the fjords.
I like to show them once to all of you.
Maybe when Dagmar's big, we go back once one summer. Like tourists. You like?
Here, kitty, kitty.
Here, kitty, kitty.
Oh, Uncle Elizabeth.
Could you not wait till Dagmar comes home to do this?
- Nels, what you think?
- He's pretty bad.
Honestly, I think we should get him out of here and put him away.
Elizabeth.
Dagmar. Dagmar, wait a minute.
I must tell you, Uncle Elizabeth is kind of sick.
- Sick? What's the matter with him?
- Well, he...
He has been in fight again, last night.
He come home this morning...
...very sick indeed.
- Yeah.
- Dag...
- Dagmar.
Mama, what happened to him?
Oh, Mama.
- He looks awful.
- Yeah, come away, little one.
Nels takes care of him.
Listen, Dagmar.
Sweetheart.
Would it not be better for poor
Uncle Elizabeth to go quietly to sleep?
You mean go to sleep and never wake up again?
Well, if...
I think he will die anyway.
Mama can make him well.
Mama can do everything.
Make him live, Mama.
Make him well again. Please.
Well, we see. Let us see how he gets through the night.
Now, come on.
You must go upstairs, go to bed.
I bring up your supper.
You will make Uncle Elizabeth well again.
- Please promise, Mama.
- Well, I promise I try.
You say we see how cat get through the night.
I ask you, how do we get through the night?
It's no use, Martha.
We must put the cat to sleep.
- Mama, it's cruel to keep that cat alive.
- Yeah, I know.
Nels, you go to the drugstore and get something.
- Some chloroform, maybe.
- Chloro...
- How much should I get?
- You tell the man it is for a cat. He knows.
Okay.
It's no use, Martha. It's best thing to do.
It's just sad homecoming for Dagmar.
And she was so good in the hospital too.
- Here you are.
- Thanks, Mr. Schiller.
You're welcome.
Did you see him?
Mr. Hyde.
- He must be going for keeps.
- What'll Mama do without a boarder?
- She needs the money.
- I hope he's paid whatever he owes her.
Mama.
- Mama?
- Yeah?
Mama, we saw Mr. Hyde get in the streetcar with his suitcases.
He left this for you.
Nels, take off your hat.
Christine, close the door.
How much is the check for?
One hundred and thirty dollar.
- Is four months.
- Is good, good.
Is wonderful.
Now we pay doctor everything.
And you can buy your new coat, your warm coat.
Yes, you can buy your new coat.
But there will be no more reading.
What does Mr. Hyde say?
"Dear friends, I find myself compelled...
...to take a somewhat hasty departure from your house of happiness."
Beautiful letter.
"I am leav... Leaving you my library for the children."
- He leaves his books?
- Well, he says so.
Nels, is wonderful. Go get the books.
What else he say?
"It has been a privilege to be a part of your happy home.
I shall never forget your kind hosp... Hospitality."
He signs it Jonathan Hyde.
"Avenue..." Oh, "avenue..."
- Well, here, I think...
- I think it's "vale." "Ava vale."
"Ave Atque Vale."
- Is what?
- It means, "hail and farewell."
- It's Latin.
- Yes, is Latin, sure.
Gee willikers, look at this.
- Fine.
- The Pickwick Papers.
The Complete Shakespeare.
Alice in Wonderland.
- So much we can learn.
- The Last of the Mohicans.
- You get it, Nels?
- Yeah.
You know how?
Well, no. I thought that...
Well, just don't stand there, girls.
Christine, go take Dagmar her tray.
Katrin, put the butter in the cooler for me.
Here, take the jelly too.
Pick up your feet.
Well, take Dagmar her milk.
Lars.
You know how?
No, but, well, it shouldn't be too difficult.
- Lf you hold the cat...
- Me hold the cat?
You hold the cat.
- Nels...
- No, no.
I think it's better if...
If we get a big sponge.
We put it in the box with him and cover him over.
Nels, you get a sponge, and we make him ready here in the pantry.
Sure.
- Has he paid you his rent?
- Yeah, sure.
How?
Well, he give me his check.
Lars has it right here.
A check.
Jenny, what is it? What is it?
I was at Mr. Kruper's down the street.
Mr. Hyde was there today having his lunch.
And when he left, he asked if he would...
...cash a check for him for $50.
- So? So what?
- Well? Go on. Go on.
Mr. Hyde doesn't even have an account at the bank.
You mean, this check is no good?
- No good at all.
- But...
Your Mr. Hyde was a crook.
How much was that check for?
Martha. I bet he owed you plenty, didn't he?
He owed us nothing.
Nothing.
He pay with far, far better things...
...than money.
I'll bet it must have been $ 1 00 that he rooked you of, wasn't it?
Jenny, I cannot talk to you now.
Maybe you don't have things to do.
- I have.
- What have you got that's so important?
I have to chloroform a cat!
Kitty.
Elizabeth.
Mama, how's Uncle Elizabeth?
Dagmar, why so early?
Why you don't rest?
I wanna see Uncle Elizabeth.
- No, no, Dagmar.
- Dagmar...
Good morning, Papa.
Is Uncle Elizabeth all better?
Dagmar, there is something
I must tell you.
I wanna see Uncle Elizabeth first.
No, Dagmar.
Good morning, my darling Elizabeth.
Are you still asleep, you old sleepy cat?
Lars, do something. Tell her.
Wake up. It's morning.
Well, maybe it's good for her to think that that cat died by itself.
We cannot tell her lies.
My, what a funny smell.
It's like it was in the hospital.
I'll take care of you, Elizabeth, the way the nurses took care of me.
You'll soon be the wellest cat in all of San Francisco.
My goodness, you put enough blankets on him.
Did you think he'd catch cold?
Mama, look.
Dagmar, let me see.
Let me see that cat.
Here.
Uncle Elizabeth speak to me.
It's a miracle.
Oh, Mama, I knew you'd make him well.
- Oh, but, Dagmar...
- I'm gonna take him and show him to Nels.
Dagmar, I didn't...
Nels, Christine, look what Mama did!
You didn't give him enough.
You just give him good sleep.
But Lars, we must tell her.
Is not good to let her grow up believing I can fix everything.
Maybe is best thing in the world for her to believe.
Besides, I know exactly how she feels.
At the time, it seemed like ages.
But now I know that the days and months...
...went by too fast while we were growing up and learning.
Graduation day assumed monumental proportions.
Especially because I was to play Portia...
...in the school production of The Merchant of Venice.
The quality of mercy is not strained.
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven...
...upon the place beneath.
It is twice blest.
It blesseth him that gives and him that takes.
Him that takes.
"It blesseth him that gives and him that takes." What's after that?
- I don't know or care.
- Why, Chris.
I don't. It's all I've heard for weeks.
The school play and your graduation, going on to high...
...never a thought about home. All you and your friends think about...
...is the presents you'll get.
You make me ashamed of being a girl.
Have you heard about
Thyra's graduation present?
- Hello, Katrin.
- Hello, Madeline.
- What are you getting?
- Well, they haven't actually told me...
...but I think I'm going to get that.
You mean the dresser set?
Your father took it out so I could touch it.
It's got everything.
Even a hair receiver.
And it's genuine celluloid.
- Well, you're not gonna get it.
- How do you know?
- Because I know what you are getting.
- What is it?
Mama's giving you her brooch.
Her solje.
That old silver thing she wears that belonged to grandmother?
What would I want with an old thing like that for?
It's an heirloom.
Mama thinks a lot of it.
Then she ought to keep it.
That's all they're going to give me?
- What more do you want?
- I want the dresser set.
My goodness, if Mama doesn't realize what's a suitable present...
It's practically the most important time in a girl's life, when she graduates.
- And you say you're not selfish.
- It's not selfishness.
What else would you call it?
With Papa not working, we need every penny we can get.
Even the little bank's empty.
But you'll devil Mama into giving you the dresser set somehow.
So why talk about it?
Walk faster if you're going to walk with me.
Christine was right.
I got the dresser set.
They gave it to me toward the end of supper on graduation night.
Papa couldn't attend the exercises because there was a strike meeting...
...to decide about going back to work.
- I'll start the dishes, Mama.
- Yeah, yeah.
We can wash them when we come home.
Katrin, why you don't eat your rice pudding?
Mama, I couldn't eat. Not now.
Who wants some coffee sugar? Dagmar?
Thank you, Papa.
Katrin?
No, Papa.
Katrin, get your coat. You'll need it.
Yes, Mama.
Aunt Jenny says if we drink black coffee...
...it turn our complexions dark.
I'd like to be a black Norwegian like Uncle Chris.
I like you better blond, like Mama is.
When do you get old enough to drink coffee and not turn dark?
Well, one day when you're grown up.
It's the most wonderful night in my life.
Is that black coffee you dip that sugar in?
You shouldn't. It's not good for them.
It will turn...
It will turn your complexion black.
Aunt Jenny, did you see my graduation present?
Look, it's got a hair receiver.
But I thought... Martha.
- Yeah, Jenny, you were right.
- I thought you were...
She's too young to appreciate that.
She likes something more modern.
You're not wearing your solje.
No, I do not wear it tonight.
- Come on, Trina, we'll be late.
- Oh, but Peter isn't here yet.
- You like to wait for him?
- Yeah.
- I hope Katrin knows her part.
- She sure does. I know it too.
Lars, you be back before us?
- I don't think the meeting will take that long.
- Is good. All right, now we go.
Katrin, come.
- Goodbye, Papa.
- My daughter, I think of you.
- See you there, Aunt Trina.
- Good luck!
I knew you would devil Mama into giving it to you.
I didn't.
I showed it to her in
Mr. Schiller's window.
And made her sell her brooch her very own mother gave her.
- What?
- You weren't supposed to tell that.
I don't care. I think she ought to know.
Is that true? Did Mama...?
- Nels?
- Well, yes.
- Come on.
- No, I don't believe it.
- I'm going to ask Papa.
- You haven't got time.
I don't care.
Well, I hope you're satisfied.
Papa! Papa!
Christine said...
Papa, did Mama sell her brooch to give me this?
Well, Christine shouldn't have told you that.
It's true, then.
Well, she didn't sell it. She traded it to Mr. Schiller for your present.
Oh, but she shouldn't...
- I never meant...
- But, look, Katrin...
...you wanted your present, and Mama wanted your happiness.
Well, she wanted that more than she wanted that brooch.
But I never meant her to do that.
She loved it so.
It was all she had of Grandmother's.
But she always meant it for you, Katrin...
...and you mustn't cry.
You have your play to act.
I don't want to act in it now.
- But you must. Your audience is waiting.
- I don't care.
But you must care.
Now, look, Katrin...
...tonight you are not Katrin any longer.
Tonight you are an actress, and an actress must act...
...whatever she is feeling.
There's an old saying that says:
- The...
- The mails must go through!
The mail...
The show must go on.
Now, you stop crying and go back and act your play.
We'll talk of this later. Afterwards.
All right.
I'll go.
I'm worried about her, Lars.
She was not good in the play tonight.
I've heard her practice it here.
She was good.
But tonight...
I don't know. She was not good.
Look, Martha, tonight after you leave...
...Katrin found out about your brooch.
- My brooch?
- Yeah.
- How? Who told her?
Christine.
- Why?
- I don't know.
Christine!
Christine!
Yes, Mama?
Did you tell Katrin tonight about my brooch?
Yes.
Why did you?
Because I hated the smug way she was acting about that dresser set.
Is no excuse. You make her unhappy.
You make her not good in the play.
Well, she made you unhappy, giving up your brooch...
Is not your business.
I choose to give my brooch.
Is not you to judge. You know
I do not want you to tell.
I'm angry with you, Christine.
I'm sorry.
But I'm not sorry I told.
Christine is the stubborn one.
Come on, Katrin, it's all right.
What happened at the meeting tonight?
Oh, we go back to work tomorrow morning.
That's bully, isn't it, Mama?
Yeah, is good.
Here's your brooch, Mama.
I'm sorry I was so bad in the play.
I'll go help Christine with the dishes.
Mr. Schiller give it back to her?
We went to his house to get it.
He didn't want to, but Katrin begged and begged him.
And the dresser set, she give that back?
It was awful hard for her to do, Mama.
She's a good kid.
Good night. I gotta get up early.
- Good night, Nels.
- Good night, Papa.
- Good night, Nels.
- Good night, Mama.
Nels is the kind one.
Katrin.
Katrin.
Katrin, come here.
You put this on.
No, it's yours.
It is your graduation present.
I put it on for you.
I'll wear it always.
I'll keep it forever.
Christine should not have told you.
I'm glad she did now.
I'm glad too.
Good night, Christine.
Good night, Mama.
Good night, Papa.
Good night, baby.
Good night, Katrin.
Good night, Christine.
Katrin.
I'm sorry, Papa.
I just don't feel like it.
Katrin.
For me?
For our grown-up daughter.
- Katrin is the dramatic one.
- Yeah.
Is too bad. Her first cup of coffee, and she doesn't drink it.
It would not have been good for her so late at night.
Lars, you drink it.
We do not wanna waste it.
And you, Martha, are the practical one.
There is a time for everything.
A time for being born and a time for coming of age...
...and there is a time for death too.
I remember when the telegram arrived.
- Jenny! Uncle Chris is dying!
- I don't believe it.
- He's too mean to die, ever!
- I cannot stop to argue.
There's a train at 1 1:00.
It take four hours.
You call Sigrid and Trina!
When Mama told me I was to go with her,
I was thrilled...
...and I was frightened.
It was exciting taking sandwiches on the train...
...as though we were going on a picnic.
But I was scared at the idea of seeing death.
Although I told myself that if I were going to write...
...I'd have to experience everything.
But, even so, I hoped it would all be over when we got there.
It was afternoon when we arrived.
The ranch was about three miles from the town...
...a rambling, derelict old place.
There were wide fields and tall trees and the smell of honeysuckle.
The woman came out on the steps to meet us.
How is he? Is he...?
Come in, won't you?
I want more.
Give me more.
There's still some in the bottle.
Uncle Chris, that will not help now.
It always help. Now especially.
Uncle Chris, I don't think you realize...
What don't I realize?
That I'm dying?
Why else do I think you come here?
Why else do I think you stand there watching me?
Get out.
Get out. I don't want you here.
Oh, very well. Very well. We be outside on the porch if you want us.
That is where I want you, on the porch.
Oh, wait. That is Arne. Come here, Arne.
How is your knee?
It... It's fine, Uncle Chris.
Does not hurt anymore?
No.
You don't say "dum geit" anymore?
No, Uncle Chris.
You walk good?
- Quite good?
- Yes.
Is good.
- Uncle Chris, Arne has always been...
- I tell you all to get out!
Except Martha.
Katrin.
Katrin can stay. She and I have secret.
Do you remember?
Yes, Uncle Chris.
Uncle Chris, what are you doing?
You must lie down again.
- Why didn't you give me drink?
- No, Uncle Chris.
We cannot waste what is left in the bottle!
You do not drink it.
Who will drink it when I'm gone?
What harm can it do now? I die anyway.
You give it me.
All right. I give you drink.
You lie down again.
- Martha.
- Yeah.
You sell this ranch and give the money to Jessie.
Jessie?
Jessie Brown, my housekeeper.
No. Why do I call her that to you?
She is my wife.
For several years, she has been my wife.
She used to have husband in asylum in Stockton...
...but when he die, we get married.
Only I do not tell the aunts.
They snub her before.
So...
- I play fine joke on them.
- Yeah.
But there is no money for you, Martha.
Always I wanted there should be money to make Nels doctor.
But there were other things.
Quick things.
And now there is no time to make more.
There is no money.
But you make Nels doctor all the same.
- You like?
- Yeah, sure, Uncle Chris.
Is what Lars and I have always wanted for him.
To help people who suffer.
Is greatest thing in world.
It is to have little of God in you.
Where is Jessie?
I think she wait outside, Uncle Chris.
You call her.
I like you both be here.
Oh, Katrin.
Your mama write me you drink coffee now?
Katrin, who will be writer.
You're not frightened of me now.
No, Uncle Chris.
One day maybe you write story from Uncle Chris.
If you remember.
I'll remember.
I think best maybe
Katrin go away now.
Farvel, Katrin.
Goodbye, Uncle Chris.
You say it in Norwegian, like I do?
Farvel, Uncle Chris.
Maybe I should introduce you to each other.
Jessie...
...this is my niece, Martha.
The only one of my nieces I can stand.
Martha...
...this is my wife, Jessie...
...who has given me much happiness.
I'm very glad to meet you.
- I am too, Martha.
- Is good.
And now...
...you give me one more drink.
You have drink with me, both of you.
That way, we finish the bottle.
Yes?
Yeah, sure, Uncle Chris.
Jessie, you get best glasses.
What is the time?
Is about half past 4, Uncle Chris.
The sun come around this side the house in afternoon.
I pull the shade.
No! No, Martha!
I don't like it dark.
The sun is good.
No, no, no. I take now without water.
Last drink always without water.
Is Norwegian custom. True?
True.
No, no. I do not need you feed it to me.
I can drink myself.
You give Martha her glass?
So.
Farvel, Uncle Chris.
Oh, these gnats.
They're always worse around sunset.
Oh, sweetheart, stop honking that horn.
My goodness, you'll wear the thing out.
All this expense to watch a wicked old man die of the DTs.
Well, you can't hurry these things.
I mean that...
Well, Mr. Thorkelson say that...
Uncle Chris is gone.
Did he...? Did he say anything about a will?
There's no will.
Well, then, that means...
We're his nearest relatives.
- There is no money either.
- How do you know?
He told me.
What's that?
Is an account of how he spent the money.
Bills from a saloon.
No, Jenny.
No.
I read it to you.
You know how Uncle Chris was lame, how he walked always with limp.
It was his one thought. Lame people.
He would have liked to be doctor and help them.
Instead, he...
He help in other ways.
I read you the last page.
"Joseph Spinelli, 4 year old...
...tubercular left leg, $337.1 8.
Walks now.
Esther Jensen, 9 year.
Club foot, $21 7.50.
Walks now.
- Arne Solfeldt."
- My Arne?
"Nine year.
Fractured kneecap...
Mother.
When do we eat?
What is it?
Is Uncle Chris...?
I like to write "walks now." Yeah?
Yeah.
Or maybe even "runs"?
So...
...is finish.
Was good.
Was good.
You can go in and see him now if you want.
Maybe you never meet
Uncle Chris' wife...
...Mrs. Halvorsen.
Is true.
How do you do?
Jessie...
...I go in and wash the dishes.
How's that?
You like to come to San Francisco for a little, to our house?
Thank you.
I like to have you.
We got room, plenty room.
I don't know why you should bother.
You were good to Uncle Chris.
Thank you, Martha.
Thank you, Martha.
Katrin.
You come and see him.
See him?
- You mean...?
- Yeah, I like you see him.
He looks happy.
I like you to know what death looks like.
Then you are not frightened of it ever.
Will you come with me?
Yeah, sure. I come.
The woman.
One year later, my Aunt Trina and Peter Thorkelson...
...were married in our parlor.
One year after that...
Who is the most beautiful Norwegian baby in San Francisco?
Look. He's asleep.
- Trina.
- Yeah.
Do you know what next Thursday is?
Our anniversary.
What would you think of our giving a little party?
I think it is time you took your place in society.
Well, what would you say to ice cream and cookies for the ladies?
And coffee, of course.
Perhaps port wine for the gentlemen.
- Port wine?
- Just a little.
You could bring it in already poured out in little glasses.
And Jenny or Sigrid could help me serve the ice cream.
No.
You will have someone in to help you in the kitchen.
You mean a waitress?
Oh, Peter. But none of us have ever...
You don't really think...
Oh, no.
Trina...
...there is something
I would like to tell you.
I am not very good at expressing myself...
...or my deeper feelings.
But...
...I want you to know...
...that I am not only very fond of you...
...but I'm very proud of you as well.
And l... I want you to have the best of everything...
...as far as it is in my power to give it to you.
I want you to have a waitress.
Oh, Peter.
Papa was working steadily now, and the little bank was fuller...
...than it had ever been, but the old and thrifty ways continued.
I've just decided something.
What have you decided?
If Nels is gonna be a doctor, when I grow up, I'm gonna be a veterinarian.
I remember one afternoon...
...when I was going out to shop for Mama.
- Goodbye, everybody.
- Goodbye.
A horse doctor? Goodbye, Katrin.
There are more animals in the world than there are human beings...
...and more human doctors than there are animal ones.
It isn't fair, Mama.
I don't suppose we can have a horse, can we, Papa?
- Maybe a pony?
- A pony?
Dagmar, what are you going to do when the pony grows up to be a horse?
Oh, I never thought of that yet.
- What is it?
- Mama...
...l'm not going to college.
And why not?
Because it'd be a waste of money.
The point of my going to college...
...was to be a writer.
- Well, I'm not going to be one.
- Katrin. Is your letter makes you say this?
Has a story come back again?
This is the tenth time.
- It's the best I've ever written.
- What your teacher say about this?
Teachers don't know anything about writing.
They just know about literature.
Say... Say, Katrin, last night,
I read an article in the newspapers.
I saved it for you.
You know, my eye just caught a headline. It says...
Oh, here it is.
It says, "Woman writer tells key to literary success."
- Who?
- Is a lady called...
- Where is everybody?
...Florence Dana Moorhead.
- Lars, the spread.
- All right, Mama.
- "Florence Dana..."
- What's going on here?
- Nothing.
- It gives her picture here.
Did you ever hear of her?
Yes, of course. Everyone has.
- She's terribly successful.
- What does she say is the secret?
Well, she say... Katrin, you better read it. Here.
Look.
"Florence Dana Moorhead, celebrated novelist and short-story writer..."
Blah, blah, blah.
"Interviewed today in her suite at the Fairmont."
Blah, blah.
"Pronounced sincerity the one essential quality for success as a writer."
A lot of help that is.
If you sent your stories to this lady...
...maybe she'd tell you what's wrong with them.
- Oh, Mama, don't be silly.
- Well, why is silly?
In the first place, she's a very important person, a celebrity.
And she'd never read them.
In the second place, you seem to think that writing's like...
...well, like cooking or something, that you just need a recipe.
It takes a lot more.
You've got to have the gift for it.
You have to have the gift for cooking too.
But there are things you must learn...
...even if you have the gift.
Well, that's the whole point.
I haven't.
I know now.
So, Papa, if you're through with the paper...
...l'll take the want-ad section, see if I can find myself a job.
This lady in the paper, what else does she say, Nels?
Well, not much.
The rest seems to be about her and her home.
"Apart from literature, Mrs. Moorhead's main interest in life is gastronomy."
Gastronomy. The stars.
No, eating. "A brilliant cook herself, she says that she would as soon...
...turn out a good souffle as a short story.
Or find a new recipe as she would a first edition."
Mama, I'll go see if I have any puppies yet.
Yeah.
Let's see her picture.
Is kind face.
What is "first edition"?
- Christine, look.
- What, Dagmar?
- I've got puppies!
- How many?
We'll see. What will I call them?
Are you coming?
Don't name them anything till I get there.
Ms. Moorhead.
Calling Ms. Moorhead.
Ms. Moorhead.
Calling Ms. Moorhead.
- Call for Ms. Moorhead.
- Yes?
Ms. Moorhead?
- Ms. Florence Dana Moorhead?
- Yes?
Could I speak to you, please?
Yes. What's it about?
I read in the paper what you say about writing.
- Oh, yes.
- My daughter Katrin wants to be writer.
Oh, really?
- I bring her stories.
- Look, I'm afraid I'm in a hurry.
- I'm leaving San Francisco this evening.
- But if I could talk...
...for just two minute. That's all.
- I've had to make it a rule...
...never to read anyone's unpublished material.
It said that you like to collect recipes for eating.
Yes, I've written several books on cooking. l, too, am interested in gastronomy.
I am good cook. Norwegian.
I make good Norwegian dishes.
Lutefisk and koettbullar...
...that's meatballs with cream sauce.
- I know. I've eaten them in Christiania.
My mother give me special recipe for koettbullar.
She was best cook I ever know.
Never have I told this recipe, not even to my sisters...
...because they are not good cooks.
But if you let me talk to you,
I give it to you.
Is fine recipe.
Now, your daughter wants to write, you say.
- Yeah.
- Does she write?
- Or does she only want to write?
- She writes all the time.
Maybe she should not be author, but is hard to give up something...
...that has meant so much.
- I agree.
- I bring her stories. I bring 1 2.
- Twelve.
Well, if you could read maybe just one.
To know if someone cooks well, you do not need to eat a whole dinner.
You're very persuasive.
- Why didn't your daughter come herself?
- Well, she was too unhappy...
...and too scared of you.
You are celebrity.
- But I see your picture in the paper.
- That frightful picture.
Well, is a picture of woman who like to eat good.
It certainly is.
Now tell me about the koettbullar.
Yeah.
When you make the meatballs, you drop them in boiling stock.
Not water. That is one of the secrets.
And the cream sauce is another secret.
Is half sour cream, added at the last.
Oh, that sounds marvelous.
You have to grind the meat six times...
...and then you...
Well, I could write this out for you.
And while I write, you could read.
I remember that having written a tragic farewell to my art...
...I was busy tearing up all the stories I'd ever written...
...when I heard Mama's voice at the foot of the attic stairs.
- Katrin?
- Yes, Mama.
You are writing?
No, Mama.
That's all over.
That's what I want to talk to you about.
It's all right, Mama. Really, it is.
I've been tearing up my stories.
Only, I couldn't find half of them.
Well, they're here.
Did you take them?
What for?
Katrin, I've been to see Ms. Moorhead.
Who's Ms...?
Florence Dana Moorhead?
You took her my stories?
She read five of them.
I was two hours with her.
We have glass of sherry.
We have two glass of sherry.
What did she say about them?
Well, she say they are not good.
Well, I knew that.
It was hardly worth going to the trouble.
But she say more.
Will you listen, Katrin?
Sure. I'll listen.
She say you write now only because of what you have read in other books.
That for years, she write bad stories about people in the olden times...
...until one day she remembers something that happen...
...in her own town, and she feels she must tell that.
And that is how she write her first good story.
She say you must write about things you know.
That's what my teacher always told me.
Yeah, well, maybe your teacher was right.
But she say you are to go on writing...
...that you have the gift.
And that when you have written story that is real and true...
...then you are to send it to her agent and say she recommend you.
Here.
No. Is recipe for goulash as her grandmother make it.
Here.
It helps, Katrin, what I have told you?
Yes, I guess it helps...
...some.
But I haven't been anywhere or seen anything.
Well, could you write about
San Francisco, maybe?
Is fine city. Ms. Moorhead write about her hometown.
Yes, I know, but you got to have a central character or something.
She always writes about her grandfather.
He was a wonderful man.
Well, could you maybe write about Papa?
- Papa.
- Papa's a fine man. Is a wonderful man.
Yes, I know, but...
Well, I go fix supper.
Papa's working late.
I like you should write about Papa.
- Special delivery.
- Oh, dear.
Mama!
- I sold a story.
- A story?
Yes, here's the letter from the agent with a check for $500.
Well, let me see.
Let me see what have here.
- Maybe I haven't read it right.
- What are you going to do with $500?
I don't know. I'll buy Mama her warm coat, I know that.
- Coats don't cost $500.
- I know.
- We'll put the rest in the bank.
- Quick, before they stop the check.
Will you, Mama? Will you take it to the bank downtown tomorrow?
What is it?
I do not know how.
Just give it to the man, tell him to put it in your account, like you always do.
Mama.
I think you better tell them now.
Tell us what?
Is no bank account.
Never in my life have I been inside a bank.
- But you always told...
- Mama, you always said...
Yeah, yeah, I know, but is not true.
- I tell a lie.
- But why, Mama?
Why did you pretend?
Is not good for little ones to be afraid...
...to not feel secure.
But now with $500, I think I can tell.
- Mama.
- Katrin, get the story.
- Now?
- Yeah, now.
- Dagmar.
- Yes, Mama?
- Come here.
- What is it?
Katrin write story for magazine.
They pay her $500 to print it.
No. You leave the rabbits.
Goodbye, Jo, Meg,
Amy, Beth, and Laurie.
Don't you do anything till I come back.
I want you be quiet and listen.
Katrin, read it to us.
You take Mr. Hyde's chair, Katrin.
"I shall read them at once and place them as soon as possible.
Very truly yours, Bertha Stewart."
What is it called, the story?
It's called, "Mama and the Hospital."
- You... You write about Mama?
- Yes.
- Is good.
- I tell you write about Papa.
I tried it that way, but it just didn't work.
- I tell you.
- Mama, I tried.
- Are you ready?
- Yes, we are ready.
"For as long as I could remember, the house on the Larkin Street hill...
...had been home.
Papa and Mama had both been born in Norway...
...but they came to San Francisco because Mama's sisters were here.
All of us were born here.
Nels, the oldest and the only boy...
...my sister Christine...
...and the littlest sister, Dagmar."
Am I in the story?
"When I look back, 1 91 0 seems like only yesterday.
I remember that every Saturday night...
...Mama used to call the family together.
I remember Mr. Hyde, dear Aunt Trina...
...and my Uncle Chris.
But first and foremost,
I remember Mama.
I remember how on every Saturday night...
...Mama would sit down at the kitchen table...
...and count out the money that Papa had brought home in the little envelope.
There would be various stacks.
'For the landlord, '
Mama would say...
...piling up the big silver pieces.
'For the grocer. '
Another group of coins.
At last, Papa would ask:
'ls all? '
Mama would look up then and smile.
'ls good, ' she'd murmur.
[ENGLISH]
You get used to it when you've been out East a bit.
Cholera, the Plague, strikes white men and native.
Men, women and children, they die by the thousands, the cholera makes no distinction.
For a long while nobody knows who's dead and who got away to the hills.
Nobody knows but the vultures, circling, waiting.
Mostly this is what you have afterward, an empty place with no breathing soul.
It's not England, Barney.
I venture to say that you'll get used to it.
- You haven't been here long enough.
- I have.
Sadee and her husband, no children identified.
I had tea on this verandah once
John Lennox, Mrs John Lennox.
If I've been a Captain or better they have asked me again.
Remember Barney I told you the cholera makes no distinction.
- Who are you?
- I might ask Miss, who are you?
My name is Mary Lennox and you haven't answered my question.
Where's my servant? Where's cook?
Sadee said my servant was ill and then Sadee never came back.
- Are you a relative of the Lennox's?
- I told you my name was Mary Lennox.
My father is Mr John Lennox and my mother is Mrs John.
They went away, they're always going away.
Your servants, some of your servants became very ill.
They, they died.
The others were frightened, they ran away to the hills.
I knew it, I knew they didn't all die.
Mother is right, she says you can't trust natives.
She ran away, didn't I tell you.
He's a silly looking man, isn't he?
With a silly looking hat.
- They was identified sir.
- Well, be certain.
- Mr & Mrs John Lennox.
- Check it again.
They died at the hospital sir, no mistake.
- What's up sir? What's in there?
- Their little girl.
I never knew they had any children.
- Who's he?
- He's my orderly, his name is Barney.
Why does he look so funny?
You need to stand up, you're an officer, aren't you?
You better stand
I'm not supposed to be in here at all you know if Mama should catch me, oh...
You never come in here Mary?
Of course not, children aren't permitted in the front of the house.
- Don't you know anything?
- I came here once.
- I didn't see you, is that why?
- Of course it's why.
She'll never see those,
I never even knew Mrs
Lennox had a little girl.
- Has she any more children?
- No, well can't you see
- I'm the only one here in the house.
- Oh, I meant home in England perhaps?
Have you a grandmother?
Somebody else home in England?
Haven't you any aunts or uncles?
What's wrong with that man?
He's a common soldier, he should be standing at attention.
- Barney...
- Yes sir?
- He looks funny.
- Never mind about Barney.
There's something I got to tell you.
I shan't be very good at it.
So you'll, you'll have to forgive me.
You see, I knew your mother.
She was a very beautiful woman.
I knew your father too, he was fine man.
But, what I'm trying to say is.
You must trust me.
- They're dead too.
- Please...
Mama didn't go away, she died.
- I know how you loved her.
- Stop talking.
- I know how she must've loved you.
- Stop talking about her, she's dead.
And who's going to take care of me.
This is good of you Nurse.
Looking after so many of them the whole long voyage to England.
Oh, they looked after themselves they became great friends.
Poor things, all of them orphans.
Say goodbye Muriel darling.
- Goodbye Muriel.
- Bye Goodbye, bye...
Her Grandmother hasn't got any money, I heard Nurse say so.
I hope my aunt is half a nice as Muriel's grandmother.
Your Aunt probably hasn't got any money either
I'm going to live with my uncle in a great house in Yorkshire.
It has a hundred rooms.
And I shall have acres and acres of gardens and a great many servants.
My uncle is Mr. Archibald Craven and he has a great deal of money.
- Your uncle is a hunchback.
- He's Not.
- He is, he is, he is.
- He isn't, he isn't.
- I heard Nurse say so.
- I'll cut out your gizzard.
No, not just as we saying goodbye.
- Can I help you?
- These are the orphans from India I presume.
- Which one is Mary Lennox?
- Are you Mrs Medlock?
- Yes.
- This one.
Unattractive, isn't she?
Oh, I wouldn't say that Mrs
Medlock, it's just her manner.
I'm your uncle's housekeeper.
We a long journey, come along.
Have you no luggage?
Unattractive, I call her.
Oh God.
Children, children.
Mrs Medlock, are we crossing the moors?
A bad night Mrs Medlock.
Bad indeed Charles, a long and nasty journey.
- Is Mr Pitcher about?
- Yes ma'am.
Fetch him, will you?
Wait here a minute child.
Good evening Madam.
Something amiss?
Oh, no sir, it's just the children on the boat said that you are a hunchback.
- He doesn't want to see her.
- So long as I know what's expected of me.
What's expected of you Mrs Medlock is that he doesn't see what he doesn't want to see.
- Well and good Mr Pitcher?
- He's leaving for London late tomorrow.
Her rooms are ready.
Good night Miss Mary.
Come along.
- Why I thought he was my uncle.
- Mr Pitcher?
He's just Mr Craven's man, rules the roost like the high and mighty I might add..
No better than me.
Well?
What's down there? The hundred rooms?
Never you mind what's down there, come along.
Here's where you play, there's where you sleep.
You might have a bright word.
Tore out everything for you, he did.
Painting, furnishing, trips to London for clothes and such.
I had my hands full, I can tell you.
You might say, you're thankful.
What's down that hall?
Now let things be understood, you play here and you sleep there.
Down the stairs on the right is the kitchen and the outdoors.
All that you're welcome .but don't you go poking about the house.
Why didn't my uncle want to see me?
I came all the way from
India and his lights on.
And is the queerest house I ever seen in all my life and he doesn't want to see me.
- Well, you might say he's the queer one.
- Well, I don't want to see him.
You're a queer one too.
I heard somebody crying.
- I told you, no gadding about the house.
- I wasn't gadding about.
I heard somebody crying,
I'm sure I heard somebody crying.
The wind off the moors, withering around the house.
And you talk about someone crying, good night.
- Hey, that awake?
- Who are you?
Why, I'm Martha.
- What does thy think of thy room?
- I hate it.
What's so funny?
Well, if you don't like it then look out a window.
- Look at the moors.
- I hate them.
Why you non seen them yet.
Don't say that because they're bare and lonely with the winter time.
You wait until it's spring and summer... and the gorse and the heather smelling high with honey and the Skylarks making noises.
- What kind of language are you talking?
- Yorkshire Miss.
Whom Mrs Medlock she say I'll be a servant ever what with Yorkshire... drooling from my tongue like rancid butter.
Rancid butter.
Say but the good Lord knows, I'll never speak a proper language.
Are you my servant?
Well there aye, you might say I'm
Mrs. Medlock's servant and then... then you might say that Mrs. Medlock's.
Mr. Craven's servant and thee are... thy are Mr. Craven's niece, so in a manner of speaking I'm thy servant.
- Aye.
- What's so funny?
I'm always laughing.
- Martha.
- In a minute.
- Martha.
- In a minute.
Hey, hey that's thin.
My pillow is on the floor, pick it up.
What thy needs is exercise.
Fresh air, good food and exercise a plenty.
That's what my mother says will do for the skinniest... and she should know, my mother, she was raising 10 of us.
I said my pillows on the floor, pick it up.
Oh, pick it up by yourself and have a bit of exercise for start thee.
I want another servant, in India it's the custom for servants to do as they're told.
And she doesn't laugh.
My servant never laughs, never.
I hate you..
My uncle doesn't want to see me and nobody will do as I say. I can't go anywhere.
- Dreadful.
- Get away from me, go away.
There, there now, there feels strange here and lonely.
After they had thy porridge and got thy self dressed, thy can go out and play.
My brother Dickon will be coming up to see thee.
- Your brother?
- Aye, Dickon, thou will like Dickon.
What a wonder he is for growing things and the animals.
Half lives on the moors he does, almost like an animal himself.
My mother told him to go and play with that poor child, she said... all by herself, up in that great lone house.
That will be a right fond of Dickon.
I never saw such a servant.
Does thoust think I play with thy brother.
I mean do you think I play with your brother?
I hate him, I hate him, I hate you.
- Go away.
- Aye.
Get thee self dressed.
Wait a minute.
- Aren't you going to dress me?
- What?
- Well in India is the custom.
- Thy can not dress thyself?
Of course I can, is just...
I do not eat porridge.
- I said I do not eat porridge.
- It's breakfast.
I don't want any breakfast Mrs. Medlock,
I'm going for a walk in the garden.
Well don't be so cocky about it.
Go away, go away, go away.
That's frightened him.
Now be the most quiet.
- Come on, did she frighten you.
- Come on then, Come on.
- Thou must be the one from India.
- I'm Mary Lennox.
Aye, I'm Dickon.
My sister Martha swore they be black, at least dark brown.
That's frightened him.
What you doing here? Where did you come from?
I came to the moor place.
I watched you go about the garden.
- There's no way in.
- In where?
The Secret Garden.
He locked the gate long years ago.
- Who locked the gate?
- The master, Mr Craven. Thy uncle.
- What you know about?
- I know what's said.
He locked the gate and buried the key and never a souls been in there since.
I don't believe you.
You know why I don't believe you, because there isn't any gate.
- I looked.
- Yeah, so have I.
Come on, come on, come on then.
- You know everything, don't you?
- Only what's said.
- Who cares about an old garden, I don't.
- Tat's why thee run about it so often?
What were you doing, hiding in the bushes watching me
I came to play with thee.
- My mother said thy might be lonely.
- Well, I'm not.
And I don't play with any servant's brother,
I never heard of anything so ridiculous.
That can just go home, I mean you can just go home.
Thou must learn not to frighten animals.
My mother sends thee a skipping rope.
- A what?
- A skipping rope.
That can play with a skipping rope.
Dickon, I...
Hey, for a young lady that took no porridge for... breakfast are suddenly making up at tea time.
I'm not hungry I'm just eating.
Give me another biscuit.
The rate thou going thy will soon resemble something lovelier than a slat.
Hey, what's that?
A skipping rope, any fool knows that.
So thy saw Dickon.
Did thy ever meet such a lad?
No I haven't.
- So that's what you do with it.
- Of course.
Any fool knows that.
You mean to tell me in India, they have no skipping ropes?
Very undignified.
Can you hand me another biscuit?
- Aye.
- Martha?
Why would someone lock up a garden and bury the key?
- So Dickon told you?
- I was just wondering.
How long it's been locked up?
I'm just a servant maid, I have no head for such matters
Martha...
I heard somebody crying last night when I went to bed. I'm sure I heard somebody cry.
It was the scullery maid.
Aye it was last night.
Yes, she had a toothache.
What a fearful row.
Mrs. Medlock said it was the wind.
Oh, She did?
Martha, has my uncle left the landing yet.
He leaves tonight Miss, why thou ask?
I'm going to see my uncle. I don't care whether he wants to see me or not.
You'll speak to Mrs. Medlock.
This is the funniest house
I ever seen in all my life.
Gardens locked up, rooms you can't go into, people crying and nobody will say anything.
- I'll make my uncle explain things.
- Child, thy does not know thy uncle.
Mary.
Mary..
Mary...
Mary?
Martha.
Martha...
You.
- What you doing here, what you want?
- I want to go back to my room.
Next time you'll stay where you belong.
Mrs. Medlock, I...
- What was in that room?
- Go to bed.
- Where have you been?
- No where.
Your uncle wants to see you, he's leaving for London.
- I don't want to see him.
- Mary, your uncle wants to see you.
We're keeping him waiting.
Miss Mary sir.
Come closer.
- Closer.
- Yes sir.
- I hoped you might be beautiful.
- No sir.
You're welcome in this house.
I shall be leaving for London in a few minutes...
I spend as little time here myself as possible, you'll be alone.
You'll find my being away of no great loss to you,
I'm not amusing, I keep to myself. I have my books...
I drink.
I hoped you might be beautiful.
- Is anything particular you want?
- No sir.
Is there anything you care to ask me?
I shall be gone a long time.
- Yes sir, just...
- Just what?
Who's the Lady in the picture?
My wife, she's dead. She died 10 years ago.
This is an excellent house for bitterness, for regret, for anger against the gods.
It's a poor house for children Mary.
But perhaps you're equal to it, I'm not, good night.
One.
One.
Bother...
Hello, I'm Mary Lennox back from India, who are you?
I'm Ben Weatherstaff and
I'm the head gardener... and I come from here about.
- What was thou doing beside the wall?
- The wall, what wall?
Oh, I was just skipping rope,
I'm always skipping rope.
- Let's see thee skipping.
- Oh, I don't feel like it right now.
Mr Weatherstaff, what kind of bird is that?
Him? A Raven.
- Has thee never seen a raven before?
- Well, in India we have lots of other birds.
Oh, look at you.
- Why, he likes me.
- Thay might say it comes natural.
That and me, we have faces like pickles.
He likes me, he likes thee.
- Does he live on the other side of the wall?
- Aye, Perhaps.
Have you ever been on the other side of the wall Mr. Weatherstaff?
Why does that ask?
Oh, I was just wondering, have you?
Perhaps.
- In the old days.
- How long it's been locked up?
Ten years, come summer.
- Ten years?
- What of that?
Oh, nothing, my uncle just happened to mention.
We're having a little talking and he said that Mrs. Craven...
Gee told thee about it?
Not exactly.
Let him tell thee the rest of it.
Be off, both of thee.
Well, well, good day Mr. Weatherstaff.
Stop following me, go away.
It's alright as long as you don't make yourself so conspicuous.
Bound to be a gate somewhere.
You're disgusting.
Well, I suppose we all have to eat sometimes.
They could've walled-up so there isn't any gate.
Why should he want to do that?
No, I'm not going to look, I saw what you did last time.
I'm not going to help you.
I, I, I was just digging for worms.
- He was hungry.
- What's in that pocket?
Oh, oh, my skipping rope, that's all, just my skipping rope.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine...
- You're a ghost.
- I'm not at all a ghost.
- Are you?
- No I'm Colin Crane and who are you?
- I'm Mary Lennox, Mr. Craven is my uncle.
- He's my father.
- Your father?
- Right.
So I have a cousin.
But you can't be the one who was making all that noise.
- When?
- The night Mr. Craven left for London.
Oh. Oh, yes.
That's all, just my skipping rope.
A tantrum? Why that's ridiculous.
- Not at all.
- It is.
I had dozens of tantrums and
I never made that much noise.
Course not.
Doctor Griddlestone says I have the worst tantrums south of the Scottish border.
It's 85 miles from the Scottish border, I looked it up on the map.
- Well, I never...
- You may ask Doctor Griddlestone.
- Why hasn't anyone ever told me about you?
- Oh, they're not allowed to talk about me.
Who won't allow it? Your Father?
No, I won't allow it.
They've to do what I say.
I don't like to be looked at either.
A lady looked at me she said once..., said poor child and put her face not that far from mine.
- What did you do?
- I barked like a dog and she ran away.
Well I never, all my life...
- Why don't you liked to be looked at?
- Because I'm a cripple.
Of course you didn't know.
Yes I'm a cripple as wood, cripple. Don't you hate it?
Well I never really thought about it, I really...
I can't move my legs.
I can't move them an inch.
I'll tell you something else.
I live to grow up, I got a hump on my back.
Horrid isn't it?
- Well, I really...
- It's alright, I shan't live to grow up.
How do you know?
Oh everybody says so, even though I'm listening...
I keep my eyes closed so they think I'm sleep.
That's what they say
- I'll never live to grow up.
- I don't believe you.
- Well I don't, how does anybody know?
- I don't know whether I like you or not.
And I don't believe you're going to get a hump on your back.
- Don't say that.
- Well I don't.
If you're going to get one, where's it?
Don't you dare talk like that, sometimes I almost feel it.
Go away. I don't want ever see you again never, never.
No, stay here.
I swear to goodness, I never met anyone like you in all my life.
Didn't you? Honestly?
Doesn't anyone ever come to see you?
Oh, my father. He doesn't like to see me though, he doesn't come very often.
Why doesn't he like to see you?
Oh he knows when I grow up I'll be just like him.
He hates me because I shan't live to grow up. He knows that too.
You know what I think you are?
I think you're crazy.
I do, you and your father.
- What was your mother like?
- I don't know, died when I was born.
- Then you're ten years old.
- How did you know?
- Well, your father said that, well...
- What?
Oh nothing, just that she died ten years ago.
Colin, do you know anything about a secret garden?
A garden that's been all locked up and no one is been into for, ten years?
I never go outdoors, I detest going outdoors.
- Well, have you ever heard anyone say...
- That's silly.
If there was any such place I made them show it to me.
- But, what happened to your mother?
- She was killed.
You're a very dull person.
- Colin, what you mean she was killed?
- A tree fell down or a limb or something.
It's an accident, that's her over there.
Pull the curtain.
Beautiful isn't she?
Have you ever seen anyone so strong looking?
That's enough, close the curtains.
People must do as I say,
I said close the curtains.
- Don't you want to look at her?
- No, I hate her.
- You're shocked because I hate my mother.
- I am not.
No? Most people are shocked.
After all she was my mother and she's dead.
- What's that? I hate mine.
- Really?
She never let anyone see me because I wasn't pretty.
You needn't think hating your mother is so special.
So wicked for you, after all your mother isn't dead.
- Oh yes, she is.
- She is? Really?
You must tell me about yourself someday.
- Well...
- Not now.
Colin, Colin you don't know where it was that your mother was killed?
You act as if you know something that I don't.
I don't like people who know things I don't know.
I don't like secrets.
It was somewhere on the grounds, that's all I know
I'm sleepy, you may come and play with me tomorrow.
You know what you remind me off? A young Rajah.
A Rajah?
That's a kind of king, isn't it? In India.
I like that, a Rajah.
- What you say your name is?
- Mary.
You may sing me to sleep Mary.
It's strange song,
I must ask you about it some day.
- Are you Dickon's mother?
- I am, thou must be Mary Lennox.
Oh, thank you so much for the skipping rope, Mrs. Sowerby.
Do you think if I spoke to Dickon,
Dickon would speak to me?
Thou might try and see.
He's caring for the little one.
- Oh, what's that?
- A fox cub, his name is Captain.
- Is now you're still angry with me?
- When was I ever angry with thee?
Oh, good.
Well Dickon, I got so many secrets, I'm dying, I'm just dying.
They're seems most healthy
I don't mean that kind of dying, it's just that.
Oh Dickon, I need you terribly, terribly...
All you have to do is listen to me.
What good is a secret if there's no to tell it to.
- First you must swear.
- I swear.
- Oh good, there's a secret boy you know.
- A what?
A secret boy, he lives in one of those hundred rooms.
Nobody ever gets to see him, he's 10 years old and he doesn't go anywhere.
And he's Mr. Craven's son
Colin, the one that can't walk.
Well, I thought it was a secret.
Well Mary, I never seen him but he's no secret.
My sister Martha cares him some.
Why, I was never so disappointed in all my life
- I hate you, I hate you.
- What's that?
That knows everything.
Not a great deal, I don't.
- The Garden.
- The Secret Garden.
- You found the gate?
- No, not yet.
Dickon, wait for me, wait for me.
It's bound to be behind those bushes.
What if there's no gate?
What if he sealed the wall up with stone?
If he done that, then why bury the key? That's not sensible.
Look there, he's always working behind those bushes.
It's the only place I haven't had a chance to look.
Good Morning.
Go away.
What ails thee?
You know what...
I'm afraid they sealed the door.
Dickon.
Oh, Dickon.
That?
Ah, thou, is dinner time.
The key Dickon.
Oh, open it up Dickon, please.
Grand me Mary, and none else seen in 10 years.
How that old bush would bloom with a bit of pruning.
Why, you could groom it Dickon, no one will know, except us.
Lilacs.
- Such Lilacs.
- What are Lilacs?
Has never seen Lilacs?
Mary, in India thy never spied a lilac bush in bloom?
Thy will see Lilacs.
Dickon.
Dickon look, something is coming up already.
Daffodils.
I can't tell you what a daffodil is like, except it's yellow.
Oh Dickon, we can take care of them.
- Aye.
- We can come here everyday.
We can dig around them and get rid of all those weeds.
We can make it just the way it used to be and nobody would know, just us.
- Oh, what a secret?
- Aye.
Get that...
Two?
Colin said his mother had an accident, that a tree fell on her or a limb or something.
- You don't suppose?
- Aye.
Just the two of them.
They were taking their tea.
Mr. Craven over there.
Oh, how dreadful.
He locked up the garden and left things just as they were.
Could be.
I always heard was her garden.
And none came here but just herself and the master and old Ben Weatherstaff.
- Ben?
- Aye, he tended it.
Just the two of them, taking their tea and then... the limb of the tree, falling from nowhere,
Poor Mr. Craven, what a terrible accident.
Dickon..
Mary...
I just didn't want to look at it any longer.
Aye.
But he couldn't have,
Colin said how his father loved her, and it he loved her... it must've been an accident, it just must have.
Aye.
A man, let's say, who done a bad thing, he not leave his axe for all to see.
Of course he did lock up the garden and bury the key, but...
Well, all the same, the master, have non seen him... but from all I heard tell, he is a shy and a crippled man.
Sounds make you Mary.
Would that say he was the sort of a man to, to...
I don't know Dickon
Mary, it's ten long years and I can't put my mind on dead things in the spring time.
I'm not going to think about it either,
I'm not going to think about one bit.
Thou is not such a bad looking lass at that.
Why, thou is blushing like a beet.
Now we need a hoe.
Two hoes, one for you and one for me.
You might make a list of what we need.
We have to had something cut away all that dead stuff, I hate dead stuff, don't you?
- Thou's an odd one Mary.
- Why, I'm not odd one bit.
I don't know what you're talking about.
It's lunchtime and I'm hungry.
I'll meet you here at two o'clock.
Dickon, did you really mean what you said about that I'm not so bad looking?
There they were, lions all around me.
- I'll finish the story some other time.
- Mary Lennox...
I told Martha that if you didn't tell me stories this afternoon, I have a tantrum.
- But if Mrs. Medlock should find out...
- Don't bother Mrs. Medlock.
She has to do what I say, everybody has to do what I say. Now you finish that story.
- Well, the lions attacked me of course.
- And the elephants?
Oh, the elephants were tame, they were helping me.
- What you do?
- Well, I hid behind the tree like this.
And the elephants all lined up in front of me like this...
The lions were over there, and they all roared like this.
And the elephants all went with their trunks like this.
What time is it?
It's only three o'clock.
What, what happened then?
Never mind what happened then?
You're not going to go? What happened then?
Well I ran home, the last I heard, the elephants were fighting the lions.
- Your story doesn't come out very well.
- Well, is true story.
If it doesn't come out well, I can't help it
I forbid you to leave until you make the story come out better.
You forbid me?
Or you want to play with me instead, whichever you choose
I'll play with you some other time, I have to meet Dickon.
- Who's Dickon?
- Oh, a boy I know.
I don't like him.
- You don't like anything...
- I do.
I want you to stay here and play with me.
Oh Colin, I don't want you to be angry with me but I promised Dickon.
- Like it not, some common, dirty little boy.
- He's not.
- Common dirty, common dirty.
- Don't you talk that way about Dickon.
Why, he's the most wonderful, the most, I'm leaving.
Here I am ill, I can't walk and you won't stay and play with me.
- Oh, Colin, please stop crying.
- I can't help it if I cry, I'm not happy.
I want somebody to play with me.
You won't play with me, you don't like me.
- Oh, stop it, I do like you.
- You don't, you don't, you don't.
I can't walk like other boys, I'm ill.
You don't care, you don't even care if I'll ever live to grow up.
Oh stop it, you'll live as long as I will.
- I won't, I won't.
- You will, you will..
- And in future...
- Get out of here,
Get out of here. I hate you,
I hate you, I hate you.
So I don't want ever see you again.
Make her go away, no one asked her here, I can't make her go away.
You good for nothing little scamp.
Why I could cut off your head.
You frightful child, can't you see that he's ill?
- But Mrs. Medlock...
- Get out of this room.
I told you to stay away, if ever I find you here again I'll have to talk to your uncle.
You understand me? You're only living here by your uncle kindness.
- Did you hear what I said?
- Yes Mrs. Medlock.
Oh, I'm so ill Mrs. Medlock.
What a wretched child.
I'll die Mrs. Medlock, I want to die.
There, there, I got dear
Doctor Griddlestone to see you.
She wouldn't go and I couldn't get out of bed.
Poor boy... our poor helpless boy.
We'll never let this happen again.
Will we Mrs. Medlock?
- Never.
- Never.
Poor boy...
Now, have you been taking all the medicine I left you last time?
Oh yes, Doctor Griddlestone.
And I'm sure that you kept the windows closed... and the irons.
- You kept the irons on the legs constantly?
- Oh yes doctor.
The pulse is a trifle weak.
My garden, my very own garden.
Hello, Dickon will come back soon, his spelling isn't very good but he'll come back.
Then we'll help all we can.
Maybe it live and grow and have a flower.
Just the way we like them, Dickon and I.
- We may need another hot water bottle.
- Hurry, hurry.
- It's a daffodil.
- I know.
But you don't understand, I never seen a daffodil before.
Thou unfeeling child.
Did not hear the noise that's being going on since this morning?
That's a tantrum.
- Lord have mercy, he'll die of it.
- He will never die of a tantrum.
I know.
Get out, get out, get out.
I hate you.
You're doing all the wrong things.
The nerve,
I only said you're doing all the wrong things.
Go away child, he's hysterical, do you hear? Hysterical.
Why, of all the nonsense.
- You act like the children.
- If you're so clever, go in there yourself.
Why, I would.
Mary, Mary Lennox stop where you are.
You're the one that started him off, your recklessness.
Ever since I found you in his room, he's been getting worse and worse.
But Mrs. Medlock...
And now he says he can feel the bump on his back.
- And whose fault is that?
- Stop shaking me Mrs. Medlock.
I'll let your uncle know.
You'll be sent away.
- You're making me angry Mrs. Medlock.
- I'm making you angry?
Why, you cold hearted little animal.
What you did to that poor boy?
Breaking into his room, taunting him, teasing him.
But Mrs. Medlock, he likes me.
- He wouldn't let me go.
- And now you can't even tell the truth.
- No, no, no.
- I'm in charge of this case.
- Get out.
- I won't get out.
Push your head off, see if I care.
- If I have to...
- Get out...
I hate you..
Why?
You lied to Mrs. Medlock, you don't care what you say.
You only care about yourself, you're mean and selfish.
Stop being so proud of yourself, I'm worse than you are.
- I hate you, I hate you.
- I hate you.
- Everybody hates you.
- Get out, get out, get out, get out.
You're mean.
Go on, yell your head off.
- Get out.
- Scream..
Scream.
I can scream louder than you can.
I told you so.
Nurse, Mrs. Medlock.
And don't start that crying again.
I can scream louder than you can.
And I can cry harder too although I'm not going to.
Why, you never met anyone as bad as I am.
You don't care how I'll never live to grow up.
Oh stop it, you'll live as long as I will.
You just say that to make people do as you say.
I will die, don't you dare say that I won't die.
Well, you're proud that you're going to die.
It makes you feel more special, it makes you feel important.
- You're proud.
- Nurse.
Don't you think I don't know all the tricks.
I was worse the day I was born than you are this very minute.
And don't start that crying, I won't listen.
- I do want to die Mary, really I do.
- You shouldn't.
- It's a bump on my back.
- I don't believe it.
There is, I could feel it this morning.
- Well it isn't there now.
- It is.
My father always said...
Oh Mary, I don't want to live to grow up.
Nurse?
- Show me his back.
- No, I don't want anybody to see.
- There.
- No, please.
I'm not going to hurt you.
Now there's a good boy, just a minute.
There we are.
Now turn over, come along now.
Why, there isn't a bump as big as a pin.
It's just backbone lumps and
I had those, everybody had.
And if you ever say there is a bump coming up, if you ever once say it.
Well I'll laugh and laugh and laugh...
Make everybody go away.
Mary, I'm tired.
Good night.
Go to sleep.
My father always said that some day I'd be like him.
He likely believes it.
Grownups can be awfully silly.
But let's not think about him.
It's been so awfully long since I seen you.
Tell me a story Mary.
Tell me a story about what you been doing.
- I can't Colin.
- Please.
Well, it's a secret.
Dickon and I have a secret.
I never see anybody.
I don't have any secrets.
Could I meet Dickon someday?
Why of course, I'll bring him to see you tomorrow.
Tell me some kind of story Mary.
Well, once upon a time It isn't a true story of course.
But once upon a time...
There was a secret garden.
Oh, was a lovely garden, with walls all around.
With vines and flowers...
And grown-ups never came there, only children.
It was just like the make believe garden, only it wasn't make believe.
The Lilacs and the Tulips... and the Daffodils with the most beautiful flowers of all the world.
And no one could see them, just the children.
Oh, and the children were so happy.
They were never mean and they never quarreled.
Sometimes we wished, all the children in all the world... could have a secret garden.
Just like this...
Hello, this is Dickon.
- Hello.
- Hello.
She wants a bit of breakfast, she is very starving.
It was mean not to feed her sooner but I thought that might like to feed her.
Yeah, that's right, just like a baby.
What's that?
It's a fox cub, Dickon found it on the moors, his name is Captain.
He's what you might call a volunteer.
Colin, can you keep a secret?
But you got to swear it on blood or something.
What secret?
Here, swear on this key that you'll never, never tell.
- Tell what?
- Well, how can I tell you unless you swear.
How can I swear unless I know what I'm swearing about?
We can tell him Mary.
Is just about an old garden and that's the key.
Our own garden.
Full of things in bloom and lovely smells.
And no one has been in it for ten whole years.
- But just Mary and me.
- The Secret Garden?
Mary I thought it was just a story you were making up.
Why, I dreamt about last night.
Aye and Mary and me, we dreamed of naught else, since we first found it.
We dreamed how fine it could be.
And the weeds all gone and the roses pruned.
- And none but us to see it.
- We must take you there so thou may see it.
Oh that's Dickon, he's always talking
Yorkshire then he gets me talking.
- Must thou talk Yorkshire?
- No, you don't have to do anything.
Just swear that you won't tell and then we'll show the garden to you.
I never go outdoors.
Servants look at me and...
Anyway that stupid old Doc
Griddlestone is coming this morning.
He's bringing another Doctor from London and they'll probably say I'm worse.
Oh, don't pay any attention to any old doctors.
And about the servants, all you have to tell them is to keep out of the garden.
They have to do what you say, you do us a big favor.
- Don't say anything.
- Swear.
I swear.
My wig, my wig...
My wig, give me my wig, my wig.
I'm Doctor Fortescue.
You'll pardon me my boy but I practice in London.
Is all this customary on a rural call?
I'm beginning to understand why your father thought Dr Griddlestone needed a little help.
And if you're the patient and I presume you are.
I wonder if you'll live to such a ripe old age.
- And what are these for?
- I can't walk.
I can believe you my boy.
If I had to live in this house,
I want to stay safe in bed too.
You're old enough, why don't you just retire?
Doctor Fortescue, I'm so ashamed.
- What did you lose?
- What?
- I thought you said this boy was ill.
- I beg your pardon sir?
Why don't you sell that stuff to the rag and bone man?
What are you trying to do? Build a bridge?
You speak most unprofessionally sir.
If you think that what happened this morning to poor Dr Griddlestone... has ever happened before, you're wrong.
Never in this house.
I assumed such things never happened before, if they had he'd be a different boy.
If I speak unprofessionally Dr it's because I haven't the slightest hope of influencing you.
It's my safe assumption though that the walls have ears and that the walls can understand what you cannot.
What kind of doctor is this? He's mad.
- I shall report your conduct to Mr. Craven.
- You will and he'll back you up, not me.
I diagnosed this case, accurately
I believe, when I met the father.
Examining the child was a formality.
How dare you say such things in front of the patient.
I speak in front of the patient with purpose.
Fear is a disease, fear can waste muscles, destroy men, paralyze nations.
You're not the first my boy, nor the last.
I prescribe fresh air, exercise, wild animals and children.
And take off those irons.
I write the prescription on the wind.
You, terrible children.
The irons stay on.
You can rest assured Doctor,
I take my orders from you.
Thank you Mrs. Medlock.
Tis of course for Mr. Craven to decide,
I'll report the whole matter to him,
Doctor Griddlestone...
- I'm going outdoors.
- You're not, you'll catch cold.
You'll allow me to go outdoors Mrs
Medlock or I can make myself quite difficult.
You'll tell the servants to stay in the house.
Dickon will wheel me.
Tell Ben Weatherstaff and the gardeners to work in the green houses
- I'll have no one about.
- Doctor Griddlestone?
In India Mrs. Medlock it's the custom to do as you're told.
- That wretch.
- Let him have his way.
Poor boy, he's had a difficult time of it.
I may say I had a difficult time of it myself,
I'm good, thank you.
Oh Dr Griddlestone, I assure you that this will never happen again.
- Good day.
- Good day Mrs. Medlock, good day.
Oh no, not again.
Is right in there behind those bushes.
Dickon, right now.
- Before thy goes in?
- I want to know right now.
Colin...
Go away Ben.
Go to the green houses Weatherstaff, you were told to work in the greenhouses.
You were wonderful Colin.
I hoped I might walk in.
- Could you wheel me?
- Aye.
I was so frightened the first time,
I could hardly turn the lock.
These are roses,
Those are Lilacs.
See the little lake?
I shall live forever.
I shall live forever...
Send the gentleman in.
- Good evening Doctor Fortescue.
- Good evening Mr. Craven.
Sit down.
- Brandy?
- No, thank you.
Last spring you went up to my country place to examine my son.
I had your report.
- I resented it.
- Naturally.
Now after some months you write me a letter.
Your fee was paid at the time of the examination.
I assumed that you regarded your services as ended.
I resented your report.
- I regard the letter as outrageous.
- Naturally.
You persist in regarding me as the patient as well as my boy.
Perhaps I should double my fee.
- Why did you write that letter?
- Curiosity
I may tell you Doctor Fortescue... that when I engaged you, I assumed you were a doctor of medicine.
Would it be impudent sir... to call a physician of your standing an imposter and a most dangerous charlatan?
It'd be impudent
I'm an impudent man myself
Mr. Craven, I could understand.
There is his mother, you asked.
I may tell that our marriage was the one superbly happy experience... in my less than happy life and if you imply otherwise I shall kill you.
Don't, I believe you.
For ten years Doctor Fortescue, my sanity has been a matter of... shall we say, touch and go.
I walked the most delicate balance between the Gods and lightning.
Between life and the chasm.
I have buried certain memories with utter care I have vilified others.
I don't enjoy the prospect of going insane.
Your letter Doctor Fortescue has made my balance no easier.
That was it's purpose.
- You are a passionate man Mr. Craven.
- You may leave.
That's a fine boy you have up there.
- You ought go and see him once in a while.
- I said you may leave.
I'm not too concerned with what happened between you and your wife.
I'm a doctor, not a detective.
I do know though that some kinds of memories won't stay buried.
And so we have to bury the patient.
What does concern me is the boy.
You said in your letter that I wanted him to die.
Did I? Well, I'm not too diplomatic a man, it's a technical point anyway.
I just suggest...
Well, perhaps while you were keeping your... own balance with such care you transferred your longing to die to your son.
Leave my house. You, you're a normal man.
You know what it is to be ugly?
To be cursed and set apart?
To live in fear, to be hated for things you can't help?
To be pitied..
To see your curse in every mirror, prying eyes in every face.
Your son is as normal as I am.
You lie.
Well...
I should be going.
It's been a fascinating case Mr. Craven.
Give my regards to the children when you see them, I enjoy children.
Good night.
Would thou call it an ever last of summer Dickon?
Aye, there's a smell of rain in the air.
What a fine summer it's been.
What with digging and weeding and eating your mother's bread and jam, I'm fat like a pig.
Listen to the way thy talk.
Why, I'm fat too.
I haven't got a single wrinkle left in my stocking.
Perhaps we shouldn't laugh.
Dr Griddlestone is getting suspicious.
He keeps asking me what we been doing?
I can hardly get my irons on anymore.
- They aren't big enough.
- It's Mrs. Medlock I'm worried about.
First she got suspicious because we ate too much.
And then when we started bringing things from your house and ate hardly anything at home.
Then she got more suspicious.
She's a suspicious woman.
Should I give her the sack?
No, that wouldn't do any good. Your father would just come back from London.
Do you know what I think Colin?
I think you should've a tantrum.
A tantrum?
- What if he doesn't feel like it?
- He don't have to feel like it.
I don't think I could have a tantrum even if I wanted to.
Colin, not even for our secret?
Just like Dickon says, I don't feel like it.
Miff.
That could have one.
Somebody is to have a tantrum,
Dickon is not the sort, that's.
Oh dear...
I don't feel like a tantrum either.
Oh, what's wrong with us?
- What's wrong with him?
- He's angry.
It must be the coming winter.
There, run and hide.
I can't Dickon, quick.
Open the gate.
I hate him, I hate him.
He and the others are discharged.
- You have no right to be here, Weatherstaff.
- Nor has thee, get thee back to the house.
Fine, I suppose you'll tell Mrs Medlock.
I've known where thy was all summer and I said naught.
I beg of thee, I beg of thee get back to the house
I'll have no one working here who knows.
I can't tell you what you Dad do if he found me here.
- If who found you here?
- The father.
The father is here with some gentleman from London.
Let him not find thee here.
- I beg of thee.
- Dickon.
I hate you, I hate everybody.
Dickon.
Heaven help me from coming through the hall and getting lost in this ghost trap.
- Twas easier coming up the vine.
- Dickon what's it? What's happened?
- Can thy find a way to Colin's room?
- Yes.
Take hold of me hand Mary.
If I get lost in this withering houses
I'll show you what a tantrum is.
Mary.
- I thought it was going to be my father.
- That hasn't seen him yet?, all this time?
Then I'm not too late.
What are you doing here this time of night? What's happened?
When that sees the father say naught about the garden.
Of course I.
I would just the same, when I tell you Ben's story.
- Ben Weatherstaff came to me.
- Ben?
Tonight, and me in bed and the wind howling and it's Ben off the moors.
- Dickon.
- Ben, a man so afraid I never seen.
Afraid to tell, yet failing to come to thee or Mary, thou they might not listen.
- So he came to me.
- What did he say?
Then was the old table and the broken chair and the axe in the old Oak tree... their mother.
Mary and me, we knew, never told thee.
Dickon
Ben was there, he told me all.
It was an accident Mary, we were wrong to suspect.
- Suspect what?
- Tis of no importance.
Your father loved your mother like none can tell or so Ben says.
Twas her garden and every afternoon they took their tea under the oak.
And none was there but old Ben tending the roses.
And then one day the limb fell.
The men carried your mother back to the house and there she died after thee was born.
- Why do you have to tell me about?
- I must Colin, the garden.
Ben stayed in the garden all that night, he can't say why, he just did.
With the sun not up yet, your father came back.
His eyes were like bloody ghosts from the weeping,
And his mind gone from him and an axe in his hand, the axe.
He tried to chop down the tree, he tried to kill the tree that killed thee mother.
Chopping, chopping, and the tree is stronger than thee father's crippled back.
He couldn't chop it down Colin... and he fell to the ground with the axe still in the tree.
And the tree not dented.
And he wept like a man crazy and he cursed at Ben when Ben wouldn't finish the chopping.
And then Twas sun up and thee father got up from the ground.
And he was a man different and changed and his eyes were like ice yet burning.
He swore how he lock the garden and bury the key and if ever a human being laid eyes on it again he'd see the garden destroyed... forever more.
He tear out the vines, the roses, the lilacs.
He see the trees cut down and nothing left.
He mix salt with the earth and blight the dirt, that was what he swore.
Our garden.
Just ten years ago a man can change.
- I can't believe he still do it.
- You don't know him.
What kind of a man is it that would kill a growing thing?
A bush of roses, a lily bulb waiting to bloom.
- I can't believe it.
- I'm not.
He could, he could I said these things to Ben and Ben said, but he loved her.
And I said, what of that?
Is loving somebody a reason to kill?
And Ben said, how old are thee?
Mary.
My father must've loved my mother very much.
Mother...
I suppose.
I mean, I suppose we are not old enough.
There must be an awful lot we don't know.
I don't want to know.
I don't want to grow up.
Mary,
You told me a story once... about a secret garden.
That no one but children could see.
And grown-ups never came.
The children were very happy.
It's a long time til we're grown-ups.
We're going to be happy.
Nothing is ever going to happen to our garden.
No one is ever going to know.
My father, hide.
You're awake?
Where were you when I arrived this afternoon? I asked for you, no one knew.
I was out of doors.
I came back as soon as I heard you were here.
Mrs. Medlock tells me you spent much of the summer out of doors, I'm surprised.
The house gets stuffy.
But, what you do? You can't run and play..
I watch the others.
- Mary Lennox and the neighbour boy.
- Where you go?
Nowhere father, just out of doors
I'm taking you to Italy for the winter.
- To Italy?
- Just you and I.
I've been a wretched father.
I shall try to do better.
We'll not come back to England for a long, long time.
I don't want, I mean...
Who's to look after the house?
- And...
- So I'm selling the house.
I brought a gentleman up from London with me.
If he likes the house he'll buy it. I shall know in the morning.
Sell the house?
- The gardens, everything?
- Of course, why not?
You look at me so strangely, what's the matter Colin?
I don't want you to sell it.
This is absurd, you always hated it.
Why do you want to keep it now?
You can't sell it.
Oh stop this nonsense, I'm trying to help you
- I won't leave it I won't.
- Colin, Colin I...
I die, I die, you can't sell it, you can't, you can't, you can't...
Stop it...
Oh Colin, my son.
We'll go away, we'll rid ourselves of this place and never come back.
I shared my curse with you and I can no more cure your poor body than you can cure my mind.
But I swear to you, I swear before god we'll be happy together.
While it's still time.
I owe you everything a father can owe a son.
- We'll be very happy Papá.
- Thank you.
We'll leave for Italy in a few days.
But I couldn't help wondering while I was poking about.
What stories these old country houses could tell.
Century after century,
Generation after generation.
- What tragedies, what comedies they've seen.
- Would you say we poked about sufficiently?
Forgive me, I'm a man with a great deal of money and no background whatsoever.
So that makes me a romantic.
Yes, I think I poked about sufficiently.
- Shall we go in?
- Thank you.
I'll give you my check, our lawyers in town will arrange the balance and the transfer.
Oh, thank you.
It's understood however that the check will be binding.
It's understood.
If you had children you wouldn't want to part with those gardens
I have a son, he's crippled, he can't walk.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
I'll take the check.
- What about the garden that's locked up?
- You may do with it, whatever you like
I hardly dared to ask but I hoped you might have an outside ghost or something?
You're a man of old family, you lock up your garden just to protect your valuable plants.
I'm a business man and I want a secret garden and ghosts.
If you actually expect valuable plants, you'll be disappointed.
The garden is been locked for ten years, no one is been in it in that time.
- Is inhabited in all probability by weeds.
- I beg your pardon?
Why it's as beautifully kept a garden as I ever seen.
- What?
- You saw it?
Of course, there was a ladder
I climbed the ladder.
You're lying.
I don't know what's the matter with you Mr. Craven... but is your garden and I tell you it's magnificent.
I tell you nobody is been in it for ten years.
Nobody is been in it for ten years?
- Ben Weatherstaff.
- Sir?
Get me Ben Weatherstaff.
- He's somewhere in the grounds, yes sir.
- Never mind, that's all.
I'm selling the house Mr. Gromlet to escape if possible, the temptation of madness.
It would seem that the gods arranged for me one last chance.
I've resisted as long as I can.
- Mr. Craven, sir.
- Get away.
- You must not go in there.
- Get away or I'll kill you.
- The raven Dickon.
- Maybe is Ben.
Lock the gate.
You...
Please, please Mr. Craven, we were just leaving.
- Get away from me.
- You can't do it again.
- Please, please Mr. Craven.
- Colin...
- Colin.
- Colin?
Father.
It's our garden, please.
Please, don't hurt our garden.
Papá.
Oh, Colin...
You should've come sooner, you should seen the lilacs.
Thou may see them next year sir.
- They'll be better by far.
- Next year?
- Colin will be helping us prune them.
- That may help us too.
You've got them mixed up.
You're making a mistake.
You're making a mistake with the reindeer.
Tsk tsk tsk.
Would you mind stepping out for a moment?
Open the door!
I'm sorry.
The store isn't open today.
I don't want to buy anything... and I'm sorry to interrupt your work... but I wanted to tell you you're making a serious mistake.
- Huh?
- With the reindeer, I mean.
You've got Cupid where Blitzen should be.
And Dasher should be on my right-hand side.
He should, huh?
Yes. And another thing...
Donner's antlers have got four points instead of three.
Still, I don't suppose anybody would notice except myself.
No. I don't suppose so.
- Well, bye. Thanks.
- Not at all.
Glad to have helped you. Bye.
Yes.
Jingle bells, jingle bells...
You're on float number three.
You're on the Pilgrim float.
You're on the pirate float.
You follow the van.
Mrs. Walker, something's got to be done.
That three-men-in-a-tub float isn't big enough.
We can get the butcher and the baker...
I'm awfully sorry... but I've got enough to do to take care of the people.
I was hoping you could... George!
I beg your pardon, sir.
You seem to have got mixed up with this whip of yours.
Allow me, will you?
It's quite simple, really.
- You don't mind if I show you?
- No, sir.
Now, then.
- See? It's all in the wrist.
- Is that so?
Yes, of course.
If you follow through.
Is that so?
It's just like throwing a ball.
If you were to...
You've been drinking.
Well, it's cold.
A man's got to do something to keep warm.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
Don't you realize there are thousands of children... lining the streets waiting to see you... children who have been dreaming of this moment for weeks?
You're a disgrace to the tradition of Christmas... and I refuse to have you malign me in this fashion.
Disgusting.
Tell me, who's in charge of this parade?
When you find out, tell me.
These pants are gonna fall off in Columbus Circle.
I beg your pardon.
Who's in charge here?
Mrs. Walker.
There she is, down there.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
You two ought to be over on 81st Street.
Mrs. Walker, one of the men in your parade...
What are you doing out of costume?
Get back and get dressed...
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
I thought you were our Santa Claus.
Your Santa Claus is intoxicated.
- Oh, no!
- Yes. It's disgraceful.
How can you allow a man to get into such a position?
Jingle bells, jingle bells...
Stop that!
What do you mean by drinking?
You know it's not allowed.
A man's got to do something to keep warm.
I'll warm you.
I ought to take this cane...
Somebody, Julian, get some black coffee... plenty of it, too.
Yes, Mrs. Walker.
Black with a little cream.
Wake me up when the parade starts.
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Shameful! Absolutely shameful!
Could you be Santa Claus?
Have you had any experience?
Oh, a little.
Oh, please.
You've got to help me out.
I am not in the habit of substituting... for spurious Santa Clauses.
- Oh, please.
- No, I...
Well, the children mustn't be disappointed.
All right, I'll do it.
Oh, good. Thank you.
Come right this way.
Get that costume.
Wonderful!
He's the best we've ever had... and he didn't need any padding.
What?
He didn't need padding.
Where did you find him?
I just turned round, and there he was.
I'm glad you turned round.
Just think if Mr. Macy had seen the other one!
Just think if Mr. Gimbel had seen the other one.
You want to ride in the motorcycle or a car?
No. I'm going home and get in a hot tub... and I might stay there until next Thanksgiving.
You should see it.
You worked so hard.
If I want to, which I doubt...
I can see it from the roof of my apartment.
That's right, you live down the...
Mrs. Walker!
Susan!
Susan?
- Hello, Cleo.
- Hello, Mrs. Walker.
What a beauty.
Where's Susan?
She's watching the parade.
Where? With whom?
With that Mr. Gailey in the front apartment.
Oh, yes.
I've been keeping an eye on her.
She can see everything from there.
That's the 50 yard line.
He's so very fond of Susan.
When he asked me,
I didn't think you'd mind.
Well, I guess it's all right.
I'll go on in a minute.
Looks like they're having a little trouble... with the baseball player.
He was a clown last year.
They just changed the head and painted him different.
My mother told me.
He certainly is a giant, isn't he?
Not really.
There are no giants, Mr. Gailey.
Maybe not now, Suzie... but in olden days, there were a lot of...
What about the giant that Jack killed?
Jack? Jack who?
Jack...
Jack!
"Jack and the Beanstalk."
I never heard of that.
You must've heard that.
You've just forgotten.
It's a fairy tale.
Oh, one of those.
I don't know any.
Your mother and father must have told you a fairy tale.
No. My mother thinks they're silly.
I don't know whether my father thinks they're silly or not.
I never met my father.
My father and mother were divorced when I was a baby.
Well, that baseball player looks like a giant to me.
People sometimes grow very big, but that's abnormal.
I'll bet your mother told you that, too.
Hello.
I'm Susan's mother.
Yes, I know.
Won't you come in?
Suzie's told me quite a lot about you. I'm Fred Gailey.
Yes, I know.
Susan's told me quite a lot about you, too.
- Hello, Mother!
- Hello, dear.
A cup of coffee?
You must be half frozen.
- Oh, don't bother.
- It's all ready.
In that case, thanks.
What do you think of my parade?
It's much better than last year's.
Well, I hope
Mr. Macy agrees with you.
Sugar? Cream?
Both? Neither?
Just one sugar, please.
This is very kind of you,
Mr. Gailey.
Sit down.
I want to thank you for being so kind to Susan.
Cleo tells me you took them to the zoo yesterday.
That's right, but I must confess.
It's part of a deep-dyed plot.
I'm fond of Suzie, very fond, but I also wanted to meet you.
I read someplace the surest way to meet the mother... is to be kind to the child.
What a horrible trick.
It worked.
There goes Santa Claus.
Oh, don't even mention the name.
He's much better than last year's.
At least this one doesn't wear glasses.
This one was a last-minute substitute.
The one I hired I fired.
Why?
You remember the janitor last New Year's?
Ohh, yes.
Well, this one was much worse.
Oh.
I see she doesn't believe in Santa Claus, either.
No Santa Claus, no fairy tales... no fantasies of any kind, is that it?
That's right.
We should be realistic... and completely truthful with our children... and not have them growing up believing in... a lot of legends and myths like Santa Claus, for example.
I see.
That's the end.
The acrobats were good.
They ought to be at those prices.
Thanks for the coffee.
And thank you for inviting me in.
It was a pleasure, missy.
Mother, I was thinking... we've got such a big turkey for dinner... and there are only two of us.
Couldn't we invite Mr. Gailey?
Oh, don't even think about it.
I'll have a sandwich or something.
It's an awful big turkey.
That's not it, dear... but I'm sure Mr. Gailey has other plans.
No, he hasn't. Have you?
To be quite honest and truthful with the child...
I must admit
I haven't any other plans.
Please, Mother!
Did I ask all right?
Hmm?
Didn't I ask all right,
Mr. Gailey?
That all depends.
Dinner's at 3:00.
Thanks.
Suzie, honey, you asked just right.
I'll see you at 3:00.
- It worked.
- Yes.
I tell you,
Mrs. Walker, he's stupendous.
Everybody's crazy about him.
So is Mr. Macy.
Well, hire him, by all means.
It's perfectly all right with me.
It'll save me a frantic search in the morning.
Yes. That's right.
I'll take care of it as soon as he gets through.
You'll love him.
I just know that with that man on the throne... my department will sell more toys than it ever has.
He's a born salesman.
I just feel it.
Yes, yes, yes.
We'll talk about it in the morning. Good-bye.
Good-bye.
And you'll find toys of all kinds at Macy's.
Gee, that sure is an elegant costume.
Yes. I've had it for years and years.
Sure makes a bum out of the one they gave you.
Even that one's better than the one I wear.
You, Alfred?
I play Santa Claus over at the "Y" near our block.
No kidding!
Started about three years ago.
They had a costume, but it didn't have no padding... and since I carry my own padding around with me...
I got the job, see?
You enjoy impersonating me?
- Oh, yeah.
- Why?
I don't know. It's...
When I give packages to little kids...
I like to watch their faces get that... that Christmas look all of a sudden.
It makes me feel kind of good and important.
Pardon me!
I bought a 23-pound turkey.
I had my daughter and her kids over for dinner yesterday.
There you are.
Good morning.
Oh, my, what a striking costume!
Before you go up on the floor,
I want to give you... a few tips on how to be a good Santa Claus.
Go right ahead.
Here's a list of toys that we have to push.
You know, things that we're overstocked on.
Now, you'll find that a great many children... will be undecided as to what they want for Christmas.
When that happens, you suggest one of these items.
You understand?
I certainly do.
Good.
You memorize that list...
Oh, no. 9:50.
When you've finished, come up to the seventh floor.
I'll be waiting for you.
Imagine... making a child take something it doesn't want... just because he bought too many of the wrong toys.
That's what I've been fighting against for years... the way they commercialize Christmas.
A lot of bad "isms" floating around this worid... but one of the worst is commercialism.
Make a buck. Make a buck.
Even in Brooklyn, it's the same.
Don't care what Christmas stands for.
Just make a buck.
Oh, don't bother.
I'll put it away for you.
Eh?
Oh, thank you, Alfred.
And what should I do with these?
Throw them on the floor.
I get kind of tired just sweeping up dust.
Mm-hmm.
- Thanks.
- Well, thank you, Alfred.
Yes, yes, yes.
Peter's a fine name.
What do you want for Christmas, Peter?
A fire engine, just like the big ones only smaller... that has a real hose that squirts real water.
I won't do it in the house, only in the backyard.
I promise.
Psst! Psst!
Macy's ain't got any.
Nobody's got any.
Well, Peter,
I can tell you're a good boy.
You'll get your fire engine.
Oh, thank you very much!
You see?
I told you he'd get me one.
That's fine.
That's just dandy.
Listen, you wait over there.
Mama wants to thank
Santa Claus, too.
Say, listen, what's the matter with you?
Don't you understand English?
I tell you nobody's got any.
I've been all over.
My feet are killing me.
A fine thing, promising the kid.
You don't think I would've said that unless I'm sure?
You can get those fire engines at Schoenfeld's on Lexington.
Only 8.50. A wonderful bargain.
Schoenfeld's?
I don't get it.
I keep track of the toy market pretty closely.
Does that surprise you so?
Surprise me?
Macy's sending people to other stores?
Are you kidding me?
The only important thing is to make the children happy.
Who sells the toy doesn't make any difference.
Don't you feel that way?
Who, me? Oh, yeah, sure.
Only I didn't know Macy's did.
As long as I'm here, they do.
I don't get it.
No, I just don't get it.
I quite understand.
Your little girl would like some skates.
But of course, you must get her the best...
'cause their little ankles want protecting.
Our skates are very good, but not quite good enough.
You go to Gimbels.
They'll have exactly what you're looking for.
There you are, dear.
That's for you.
Merry Christmas.
Gimbels.
Hello, my little girl.
How old are you?
Gimbels.
Gimbels!
Pardon me.
The guard said to speak to you.
You're the head of the toy department?
Yes, madam...
Listen. I want to congratulate you and Macy's... on this wonderful new stunt you're pulling.
Imagine, sending people to other stores.
I don't get it. Why, it's...
- It certainly is.
- You said it.
Imagine a big outfit like Macy's... putting the spirit of Christmas ahead of the commercial.
It's wonderful.
I never done much shopping here before... but from now on, I'm going to be a regular Macy customer.
All right, dear.
Thank you, madam.
There are six more women who want to thank you.
Not now. I've got to think this thing over.
Personally, I think it's a wonderful idea, too.
You think so.
Those women think so.
The point is, will Mr. Macy think so?
This seems awfully silly,
Mr. Gailey.
I thought as long as we're in the store... you might as well say hello to Santa Claus.
Why?
Because when you talk to him... you might feel differently about him.
Good-bye, Elmer.
Be a good boy now.
Merry Christmas!
Well, young lady, what's your name?
Susan Walker.
What's yours?
Mine? Kris Kringle.
I'm Santa Claus.
Oh, you don't believe that, do you?
My mother's Mrs. Walker, the lady who hired you.
Oh.
But I must say, you're the best one I've seen.
Really?
Your beard doesn't have those things over your ears.
That's because it's real, like I'm really Santa Claus.
Oh, go ahead, pull it.
Ouch.
All right, folks, don't crowd.
You have all day to see Santa Claus.
Now, children, behave.
This way, please.
Get back in the line there.
What would you like me to bring you for Christmas?
Nothing, thank you.
Oh, come now.
You must want something.
Whatever I want, my mother will get for me... if it's sensible and doesn't cost too much, of course.
Hello, Mother.
Hello, Susan, Mr. Gailey.
I think you've taken up enough of this gentleman's time.
The explanation for this is all very simple.
Cleo's mother sprained her ankle.
She had to go home and asked me to bring Suzie down to you.
Yes, Cleo called me.
I was wondering where you were.
As long as we're here, we should say hello to Santa.
He's a nice old man, and those whiskers are real.
Yes, dear. Many men have long beards like that.
Susan, would you stand over here a minute?
I want to talk to Mr. Gailey.
I shouldn't have brought
Suzie to see Santa Claus?
You're making me feel like the proverbial stepmother.
I'm sorry, but I just couldn't see any harm... in just saying hello to the old fellow.
But I think there is harm.
I tell her Santa Claus is a myth, you bring her here... and she sees hundreds of gullible children... meets a very convincing old man with real whiskers.
This sets up a very harmful mental conflict within her.
What is she going to think?
Who is she going to believe?
And by filling them full of fairy tales... they grow up considering life a fantasy instead of a reality.
They keep waiting for
Prince Charming to come along.
And when he does, he turns out to be a...
We were talking about Suzie, not about you.
Whether you agree or not...
I must ask you to respect my wishes regarding Susan.
She's my responsibility... and I must bring her up as I see fit.
OK.
- Say "Thank you."
- Thank you.
Bye. Merry Christmas!
Well, young lady, what's your name?
I'm sorry.
She doesn't speak English.
She's Dutch. She just came over.
She's been living in an orphans home... in Rotterdam ever since...
We've adopted her.
I told her you wouldn't be able to speak to her... but when she saw you in the parade yesterday... she said you were
"Sinter Claes"... and you could talk to her.
I didn't know what to do.
Hello.
Now do you understand?
Yes, I see what you mean, Mother.
Good.
But when he spoke Dutch to that girl, he was so...
Susan, I speak French, but I'm not Joan of Arc.
What I'm trying to explain is... Come in.
They said you wanted to see me, Mrs. Walker.
Come right in.
Hello there!
Good to see you again.
It's nice to see you.
You're awfully lucky,
Mrs. Walker.
Lovely little girl you have here.
Thank you. Susan's why
I asked you to drop down.
She's a little confused... and I thought you could help straighten her out.
Oh, glad to.
Would you please tell her you're not really Santa Claus... that there actually is no such person?
I'm sorry to disagree with you, Mrs. Walker.
Not only is there such a person, but here I am to prove it.
No, you misunderstand.
I want you to tell her the truth. What's your name?
Kris Kringle. I'll bet you're in the first grade.
Second.
I mean your real name.
That is my real name.
Second grade?
It's a progressive school.
Oh, it's a progressive school.
May I have this man's employment card, please?
Yes, Mrs. Walker.
This dress is very cute.
Where did you get such a lovely outfit?
Here at Macy's.
We get 10% off.
Please don't feel you have to pretend for Susan.
She's a very intelligent child... and always wants to know the absolute truth.
Good, because I always tell the absolute truth.
About your school...
What's the name of your teacher?
Mrs. Haley.
- Here it is, Mrs. Walker.
- Thank you.
What else do you do besides read and play games?
We have rest periods for one half-hour.
I don't suppose you care for that, eh?
No. We're not allowed to talk or anything.
Tuesday, Chester Richards kept talking all the time.
My, that was bad, eh?
Mrs. Haley made him rest all alone for nearly an hour.
Susan, would you go out and talk to Miss Adams?
I'll be right with you.
All right. Good-bye.
Good-bye, young lady.
Hope to see you again.
Thank you.
I hope so, too. Bye.
Good-bye.
I'm sorry, Mr., uh... Mr...
Kringle.
I'm sorry, but we're going to have to make a change.
Change?
The Santa Claus that we had two years ago... is back in town, and I feel we owe it to him...
Have I done something wrong?
Oh, no, no.
Well...
Yes?
Mr. Macy wants to see you immediately.
I'll be right up.
Would you sit down... and I'll be right back and sign your pay voucher.
Yes, indeed.
Go right in.
Mr. Macy's waiting.
The effect this will have on the public is...
Come in, Mrs. Walker.
- Hello, Mrs. Walker.
- Sit over here.
I've been telling these gentlemen the new policy... you and Mr. Shellhammer initiated.
I can't say that I approve of your not consulting... the advertising department first... but in the face of this tremendous public response...
I can't be angry with you.
- What's he talking about?
- Tell you later.
Now, to continue, gentlemen.
I admit this plan sounds idiotic and impossible.
Imagine Macy's Santa Claus sending customers to Gimbels.
Ho ho. But, gentlemen, you cannot argue with success.
Look at this.
Telegrams, messages, telephone calls.
The governor's wife, the mayor's wife... over 500 thankful parents... expressing undying gratitude to Macy's.
Never in my entire career... have I seen such a tremendous and immediate response... to a merchandising policy.
And I'm positive, Frank, if we expand our policy... we'll expand our results as well.
Therefore, from now on... not only will our Santa Claus continue in this manner... but I want every salesperson in this store... to do precisely the same thing.
If we haven't got exactly what the customer wants... we'll send him where he can get it.
No high pressuring and forcing a customer... to take something he doesn't really want.
We'll be known as the helpful store... the friendly store, the store with a heart... the store that places public service ahead of profits.
And, consequently, we'll make more profits than ever before.
Yes, I know it's late, and we're all tired... and we want to go to dinner... so we'll continue first thing in the morning.
In the meantime, you fellas get together... and figure out the best way to promote this thing.
We'll do that. Good night, R.H.
Good night.
I want to thank you two again.
And in your
Christmas envelopes... you'll find a more practical expression of my gratitude.
Thank you, Mr. Macy.
Tell that Santa
I won't forget him, either.
Yes, Mr. Macy.
Imagine, a bonus!
He just assumed it was our idea.
What's the matter?
- I fired him.
- Who?
- Santa Claus.
- What?
He's crazy.
He thinks he is Santa Claus.
I don't care if he thinks he's the Easter Bunny.
Get him back.
He's insane, I tell you.
We'll hire somebody else and have him do the same thing.
You heard Mr. Macy.
We've got to keep him.
What if he should have a sudden fit?
Oh, no.
I've got to tell Mr. Macy.
But maybe he's only a little crazy... like painters or composers... or some of those men in Washington.
We can't be sure until he's been examined.
If you fire him, and we find out he wasn't really crazy...
Mr. Macy will have us examined and fired.
I suppose we ought to be sure.
We could if Mr. Sawyer talked to him.
Of course.
He's a psychologist.
He's paid to examine employees.
Until we get his report, we won't say a word.
I'll get in touch with him right away.
First, get that Santa Claus back!
The examination is worthless without the patient.
It was just because
I felt we owed it to him... but Mr. Macy suggested that we find something else... for the other Santa Claus and keep you on by all means.
Oh, well, thanks.
That's mighty good news.
You'll be here in the morning then?
Certainly I will.
Mrs. Walker, this is quite an opportunity for me.
For the past 50 years or so...
I've been getting more worried about Christmas.
Seems we're all so busy trying to beat the other fellow... in making things go faster, look shinier, and cost less... that Christmas and I are sort of getting lost in the shuffle.
I don't think so.
Christmas is still Christmas.
Christmas isn't just a day.
It's a frame of mind.
That's what's been changing.
That's why I'm glad I'm here.
Maybe I can do something.
And I'm glad
I met you and your daughter.
You two are a test case for me.
We are?
Yes. You're sort of the whole thing in miniature.
If I can win you over, there's still hope.
If not, then I guess I'm through.
But I'm warning you,
I don't give up easily.
Good night.
Good night.
Oh, Mr. Kringle, first thing in the morning... would you report to Mr. Sawyer's office?
He'll give you a little examination.
Oh, we do it with all our employees.
A mental examination?
Well...
I don't mind.
I've taken dozens of them.
Never failed one yet.
Know them by heart.
- How many days in the week?
- Seven.
- How many fingers do you see?
- Four.
Muscular coordination test.
No damage to the nervous system.
Who was the first president of the United States?
George Washington.
Who was vice president under John Quincy Adams?
Daniel D. Tompkins.
I'll bet your Mr. Sawyer doesn't know that.
Good night.
Miss Adams, would you get me... the Brooks' Memorial Home in Great Neck?
It's a home for old people.
That's right.
I want to talk to the doctor in charge.
- How many days in the week?
- Seven.
The first president of the United States?
George Washington.
Three times five?
You asked me that before.
The answer's at the bottom...
I'm conducting this examination.
How much is three times five?
Same as before... 15.
You're rather nervous, aren't you, Mr. Sawyer?
Do you get enough sleep?
My personal habits are of no concern to you.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I hate to see someone tied up...
- How many fingers do you see?
- Three.
You bite your nails, too.
Tsk tsk tsk.
I want you to stand with your feet together... and your arms extended.
Then I want you to...
Muscular coordination test?
Surely. Be glad to. Ha ha.
Sometimes the cause of nervous habits like yours... is not obvious. No.
Often they're the result of an insecurity.
Are you happy at home?
That will be all!
The examination's over.
You may go.
Thank you.
You may go out that way.
And it may interest you to know... that I've been happily married for 26 years.
Really? Delighted to hear it.
Good-bye.
Get me Mrs. Walker.
Yes, sir. Your wife's on 672.
She says it's very important.
How many times have I told you not to bother me at the office?
No. Not a penny.
I give you a liberal allowance.
It's up to you to run the house on it.
If your stupid brother would get a job... you wouldn't have to pester me all the time.
Mrs. Walker, I'd like to talk to you about this Kringle.
Oh, yes. Dr. Pierce from the Brooks' home is here.
It would be a good time to settle the matter.
Sorry, Doctor, but that was Mr. Sawyer... the gentleman
I was telling you about.
He's just down the hall.
I can't tell you how we appreciate your time.
Matter of fact,
I was going to call you today.
I had a feeling about now you'd be wondering about Kris.
Dr. Pierce, Mr. Sawyer.
How do you do?
After giving this man a comprehensive examination... it's my opinion he should be dismissed immediately.
Really? He failed to pass the examination?
- Yes.
- He didn't answer correctly?
Yes, he did, but he lacked concentration.
He kept changing the subject.
Even questioned me.
I don't think there's any doubt about it.
He should be placed in a mental institution.
I don't agree.
People are institutionalized... to prevent them from harming themselves or others.
Mr. Kringle is incapable of either.
His is a delusion for good.
He only wants to be friendly and helpful.
That's what I feel, too.
Thousands of people have similar delusions... living perfectly normal lives in every other respect.
A famous example is that fellow...
I can't think of his name.
For years, he's insisted he's a Russian prince.
There's been much evidence to prove him wrong... but nothing has shaken his story.
Is he in an institution?
No. He owns a famous restaurant in Hollywood... and is a highly respected citizen.
I've made a great study of abnormal psychology... and I've found from experience when a delusion is challenged... the deluded is apt to become violent.
I'll have to disagree with you again.
If you tell Kris there is no Santa Claus...
I grant he'll argue the point, but he'll not become violent.
His whole manner suggests aggressiveness!
Look how he carries that cane!
He's never without it.
I know Kris always carries a cane... but surely you're not implying he'd use the cane as a weapon?
Mrs. Walker, naturally
I can't discharge this man.
That's up to you.
But you asked my opinion.
So when he exhibits his latent maniacal tendencies... which I assure you he will... please realize the responsibility is yours.
Speaking of delusions...
Now we're right back where we started.
No, we're not.
After listening to Dr. Pierce,
I feel perfectly confident.
But if anything happens, you won't get blamed. I will.
Nothing's going to happen.
Please don't feel what I've said was prompted by affection.
My specialty is geriatrics.
Huh?
Treatment of the diseases of old age.
I've had quite a bit of experience... and I assure you Kris has no latent maniacal tendencies.
You'll want to discuss this with Mr. Shellhammer... so I'll be on my way.
May I see Kris?
Why, certainly, Doctor.
Use the employees' elevator.
It's much quicker.
The same one you came up on.
- Where is that?
- I'll show you.
That isn't necessary.
I'll find my way.
You understand my position, Doctor.
If there's the slightest possibility... of him becoming violent or getting into trouble...
What trouble could he get into?
All that's got to happen is a policeman to ask his name.
A big argument.
Clang, clang! Bellevue!
You can prevent that very simply.
If he could stay with an employee... they could ride to and from work together.
I'd prefer he didn't take the train to Great Neck twice a day.
That would solve everything.
They could steer him away from trouble.
Sort of take custody of him.
Do you think he'd agree to that?
I'll talk to him.
I'm sure he will.
In that case, he can stay.
Good. Thank you.
It's the seventh floor, and thank you very much.
- Bye, Doctor.
- Bye.
I'm sure you made a wise decision.
Now, let's see... who could rent him a room?
You.
Your son's away at school.
What about his room?
Well, I don't mind.
I'd be glad to.
I'm positive Mrs. Shellhammer wouldn't like it.
She's a little...
Say, I have an idea.
We always have martinis before dinner.
I'll make them double-strength tonight.
I'll bet after a couple of them, she'll be more receptive.
But Kris is through work at 6:00.
What about the in-between time?
Take him home to dinner.
I'll call soon as my wife's plastered... feeling gay.
Oh, no.
If I'm willing to let my wife... have a big headache in the morning... you can have a little headache tonight.
All right.
Won't take an hour.
Everything will be OK.
Good. Very good.
What sort of games do you play with the other children?
I don't play much with them.
They play silly games.
They do?
Like today. They were in the basement playing zoo... and all of them were animals.
When I came down, Homer... he was the zookeeper... he said, "What animal are you?"
I said,
"I'm not an animal, I'm a girl."
And he said,
"Only animals allowed."
So I came upstairs.
Why didn't you tell him you were a lion or a bear?
Because
I'm not a bear or a lion.
But the other children were only children... and they were pretending to be animals.
That's what makes the game so silly.
I don't think so.
Sounds like a wonderful game to me.
Of course, in order to play it, you need an imagination.
Do you know what the imagination is?
Oh, sure.
That's when you see things, but they're not really there.
That can be caused by other things, too.
No, to me the imagination is a place all by itself... a separate country.
You've heard of the French or the British nation.
Well, this is the Imagine nation.
It's a wonderful place.
How would you like to make snowballs in the summertime?
Or drive a big bus right down 5th Avenue?
How would you like to have a ship all to yourself... that makes daily trips to China and Australia?
How would you like to be the Statue of Liberty... in the morning, and in the afternoon... fly south with a flock of geese?
It's very simple.
Of course, it takes practice.
The first thing you've got to learn is how to pretend.
And the next time Homer says,
"What kind of animal are you?"
Tell him you're a monkey.
I don't know how to be a monkey.
Sure you do.
Here, I'll show you.
Now just bend your body over a little.
Let your arms hang loose, see?
Now put your right hand up here... under here.
Now scratch yourself, see?
That's right.
Put your tongue under your lips, over your teeth.
- Like this?
- That's right.
Now scratch yourself and chatter, see?
- Bla bla bla!
- Eeek!
Eeek erp!
Haislip, Haislip, Sherman,
Mackenzie, and Haislip... have been very kind to me.
But being an exceptional lawyer,
I want to open my own office.
Put this in
Susan's place for me, please.
Take the meat out.
It should be done.
Don't forget to scratch.
Put your tongue up in front of your teeth.
Talk to the other monkeys.
What's going on here?
We're having our first lesson in pretending.
Doing quite well at it, too.
That's right.
Call the other monkeys.
No. You mustn't be a goose.
Be a monkey.
- Mr. Kringle...
- Yes?
Mrs. Walker just happened to mention... that they're looking for a room for you.
That's right.
Dr. Pierce doesn't want me making the long trip daily.
I was just thinking.
I'm all alone in my apartment.
Twin beds, plenty of room.
If you'd like to move in with me...
I'd be only too happy to have you.
That's awfully nice of you.
You could ride to and from work with Mrs. Walker.
Yes. That would give me a chance... to really talk things over with her.
Don't forget to scratch.
You're not scratching.
Besides, I could see
Suzie now and then.
Mr. Gailey, it's a deal.
Good!
We'll get your things after dinner.
Hello.
Oh, yes, just a moment.
It's a Mr. Shellhammer.
Thanks.
Hello, Mr. Shellhammer.
Yes. Just a moment.
Mrs. Shellhammer wants to talk to you.
I made the martinis triple-strength... and she feels wonderful.
Here, my pet.
Ha ha.
Hello?
Hello?
No, no. No, dear.
Thank you, darling.
Hello?
No, no, dear. There.
Oh, darling, how silly of me!
Hello!
We'd love to have Santa Claus come and stay with us.
I think it would be simply charming.
Oh, and so do I,
Mrs. Shellhammer.
Just a moment.
It's Mrs. Shellhammer.
They have the loveliest room.
They'd be so happy if you'd stay with them.
That's very sweet of them.
Please thank them very much... but I'm going to stay with Mr. Gailey.
Mr. Gailey.
I think
I'd better get the meat.
Yes, I understand that... but there must be something you want for Christmas... something you haven't even told your mother.
Oh, come on, now.
Why don't you give me a chance?
Well...
That's what
I want for Christmas.
A doll's house like this?
No, a real house.
If you're really Santa Claus, you can get it for me.
And if you can't... you're only a nice man with a white beard, like mother said.
Now wait a minute, Suzie.
Just because every child can't get his wish... doesn't mean there isn't a Santa Claus.
That's what I thought you'd say.
But don't you see, dear?
Some children wish for things they couldn't possibly use... like real locomotives or B-29s.
But this isn't like a locomotive or a B-29.
It's awful big for a little girl like you.
What could you do with a house like this?
Live in it with my mother.
But you've got this lovely apartment.
I don't think it's lovely.
I want a backyard with a great big tree to put a swing on...
I guess you can't get it, huh?
I didn't say that.
Well...
Well, it's a tall order... but I'll do my best.
May I keep this picture?
Mm-hmm.
Thank you. Good night, Susan.
Good night, Mr. Kringle.
Nice place you've got here.
Was I lucky to get it!
You like living in Manhattan?
It's all right.
Someday I'd like to get a place on Long Island.
Not a big house.
One of those junior-partner deals around Manhasset.
I know just the kind of place you mean.
One of those little Colonial houses.
Either that or Cape Cod.
You're right about Mrs. Walker.
A little more effort on your part... and she might crawl out of that shell.
Take her to dinner, the theater.
I've tried that.
She's always too busy with her job.
Try a little harder.
Those two are lost souls.
It's up to us to help them.
I'll take care of Suzie if you take care of her mother.
- It's a deal.
- Ready?
Oh, no, you don't.
I'm not gonna be cheated.
All my life
I've wondered something.
Now's my chance to find out.
It's a question that's puzzled the worid for centuries.
Does Santa Claus sleep with his whiskers outside or in?
Always sleep with them out.
Cold air makes them grow.
Joe, we're running out of books.
I'll get some right away.
I need some more Wanamakers.
Yes, I know just what you want.
We don't carry that brand, but I think Gimbels does.
Let me see. Yes, here it is.
I thought I noticed it before.
Looks like an exceptional bargain.
Yes, it does. Thank you.
Not at all.
Why didn't one of you think of this idea?
It's the greatest goodwill policy I ever heard of.
Every shopper in New York City... suddenly thinks of Macy as a benevolent soul... thinking only of the welfare of the public.
And what does that make Gimbel?
Nothing but a profiteering moneygrubber.
Two can play at this game.
From now on, if we haven't got what the customer wants... send him back to Macy's.
And what's more, we'll do the same thing in our stores... in Philadelphia,
Milwaukee, and Pittsburgh.
Get to work on it right away.
So, Gimbel's doing it in Philadelphia...
Pittsburgh, and Milwaukee, eh?
And very successfully.
Well, we can cover the country, too.
Notify our stores in San Francisco...
Atlanta, Toledo, and Newark to get going right away.
All right, Mr. Macy.
- Look this way, Mr. Gimbel.
- Hold it, Mr. Gimbel.
One more.
That's fine.
Now we'll take some at my store.
Just a minute.
I have something I'd like to give our friend here.
This is a little something to show my appreciation... for all you've done.
Thank you, Mr. Macy.
Ooh! That's very kind of you.
I didn't think you were that generous.
That's a bit of money.
What are you going to do with it?
Well, I have a friend.
A doctor.
He's been very kind to me.
He needs an x-ray machine.
I don't think that's going to be enough.
I'll make up the difference.
Buy it through the store.
Get 10% discount.
I can get it for cost.
Good night, Susan.
Good night, Cleo.
Like me to sing you a good night song?
If you want to.
Doesn't your mother ever sing to you at night?
Uh-uh. Why should she?
Oh, no reason.
I just think it's kind of nice.
- Do you like "Market"?
- All right.
To market, to market to buy a fat pig
Home again, home again, jiggidy jig
To market, to market to buy a fat hog
Home again, home again, jiggidy...
Amazing.
Do you happen to have a spare piece?
Mm-hmm.
Well, here goes.
Oh!
- Hello, Alfred.
- Hello, Kris.
How about a game of checkers after lunch?
Leave us not today.
I don't feel like it.
Oh? What's the matter?
Nothing. Nothing.
Something is wrong.
What is it?
Well, remember I was telling you... how I like to play Santa at the "Y" on Christmas... and give out packages to the young kids?
I was telling that to Mr. Sawyer, see... and he says that's very bad.
Sawyer. You mean, uh...
That's the one.
He's a psychologist.
Ohh, that's a debatable poin...
Why is it bad, does he say?
He says guys who dress like Santa Claus, see... and give presents away... do it because when they was young... they must have did something bad... and they feel guilty about it.
So now they do something they think is good... to make up for it.
It's what he calls a guilt complex.
How old are you, Alfred?
Seventeen.
Seventeen.
Doesn't seem you've had time to be guilty of anything... except overeating.
It's nothing to laugh about.
It's pretty serious, he says.
It's a lot of rubbish, Alfred.
Don't listen.
Oh, he knows what he's talking about.
He's been studying that stuff for a long time.
Well, what's the basis of this guilt complex... you're supposed to have?
Does he say that?
Well, he ain't found out yet.
It's probably way down inside of me someplace, see?
Maybe something that happened when I was a baby, he says.
It takes time, but he'll do it, he says.
You mean you're going to him again?
Sure.
I go every day after lunch.
Oh, he don't soak me nothin'.
He's doing it for free
'cause I'm an interesting case.
Yes.
What else has he found wrong with you, Alfred?
Anything else?
No. Oh, just that I hate my father.
I didn't know it, but he says I do.
And he sees you every day?
Yeah. I say anything that comes into my head.
Excuse me, Alfred.
A few things have just come into my head... and I'm going to say them.
Why are you busting in here?
Are you a licensed psychiatrist?
What business is it of yours?
I have great respect for psychiatry... and great contempt for amateurs who go around practicing it.
You have no more right to analyze Alfred... than a dentist has to remove a gallbladder!
I beg your pardon.
Your job here, I gather, is to give intelligence tests.
Passing yourself off as a psychologist.
You ought to be horsewhipped... taking a normal, impressionable boy like Alfred... and filling him with complexes.
I'm better equipped to judge that than you are.
Just because the boy wants to be kind to children... you tell him he has a guilt complex.
Sharing his delusion, you couldn't understand.
Alfred's definitely maladjusted, and I'm helping.
Maladjusted?!
You talk about maladjusted.
It seems to me the patient is running the clinic here.
I won't stand...
Leave this office immediately.
Now either you stop analyzing Alfred... or I go straight to Mr. Macy... and tell him what a contemptible fraud you are.
Leave or I'll call security.
There's only one way to handle a man like you.
You won't listen to reason.
You're heartless.
You have no humanity.
Are you going to leave?
Yes.
- Kris.
- Mr. Sawyer!
Mr. Sawyer, are you all right?
Look at that bump!
Mr. Sawyer...
He's unconscious!
Better get a wet towel.
No, better get a doctor.
You must have done something to him.
I tell you we were merely talking... but when I mentioned Santa Claus and attacked his delusion... he became violent.
I told you he had latent maniacal tendencies.
Well, I think this proves it.
Have Dr. Pierce give him another examination.
Dr. Pierce...
He doesn't know anything about this sort of thing.
He's a general practitioner.
You must admit this is rather serious.
Perhaps we'd better get a competent psychiatrist.
But he's taken dozens of those examinations... and passed them all 100%.
It's possible his condition has changed.
I don't think we can take any chances.
I can't see any harm in it.
If he passes the test, he can return to work at once... and if he doesn't, it's better if we find out.
You better have the examination right away... before he tells Mr. Ma... before Mr. Macy finds out.
Oh, my, yes.
You explain to Mr. Kringle.
After all, you're his friend.
I won't do it.
I've grown very fond of him.
This would be like telling him
I thought he was insane.
You don't call this acting normal, do you?
Of course I don't... but there are thousands of elderly who aren't normal.
This will hurt Kris deeply, and I don't want to do it!
That wouldn't be fair to him.
I'll tell him the truth.
I believe in being truthful with people.
If he sees me or you mention psychiatrist... it's more or less attacking his delusion again.
He's apt to become violent.
But in front of the children?
Oh, that would be terrible.
Get him out of the store on some other pretext.
Then once outside,
I'll explain it to him.
If you think it's better that way.
Keep a straight line.
All day long to see Santa Claus.
Oh!
- Mr. Kringle.
- Yes?
Mrs. Walker wanted you to know... that we're going to take some publicity pictures... this afternoon down at the city hall... you and the mayor.
Good. Like to meet him.
A few things
I'd like to discuss with him.
Oh, but I made an appointment with Mr. Macy at 4:00.
I want to tell him about something.
You'll be back in plenty of time.
There's a car waiting downstairs.
It's starting to drizzle.
You'll need a coat.
I'll get it.
Thanks. Be right with you.
I just want to take care of a few kiddies first.
All right.
Where to?
Bellevue.
Bellevue?!
Did she know about this?
Yes.
We all discussed it.
The second party shall... in consideration of the property... agree to be conveyed by the first party to...
Excuse me, Gertrude. Telephone.
Hello.
Yes. Yes.
Why, yes, we share an apartment together.
Bellevue?
But why, Doctor? What did he...
Oh, he's quite comfortable.
He's going to be with us for a few days... and wondered if you could bring his personal things.
Yes, in view of his examination...
I'm afraid I shall have to recommend commitment.
Yes, I know, Mr. Gailey... but I'd rather speak to you in person.
I'll be right over, Doctor.
To see the new patient.
- Thanks.
- Not at all.
Hello, Kris.
Fred.
Why'd you do it, Kris?
You deliberately failed that examination, didn't you?
Why?
Because the last few days
I've had great hope.
I had a feeling Doris was beginning to believe in me.
And now I find out she was just humoring me all the time.
I just telephoned her.
She didn't know anything about taking pictures with the mayor.
That was Sawyer's idea.
Well, I'm glad of that.
But why didn't she come to me and explain the whole thing?
She didn't want to hurt you.
Only because I was a nice, kind old man she felt sorry for.
That's not true.
Yes, it is.
She had doubts.
That's why she was just sorry.
If you'd been dragged off here instead of me... she wouldn't have been sorry.
She'd have been furious.
All right, she had doubts. Why not?
She hasn't really believed in anything for years.
You can't expect her to suddenly...
Oh, it's not just Doris.
There's Mr. Sawyer.
He's contemptible, dishonest, selfish, deceitful, vicious...
Yet he's out there and I'm in here.
He's called normal and I'm not.
Well, if that's normal,
I don't want it.
That's why
I answered incorrectly.
But, Kris, you can't just think of yourself.
What happens to you matters to a lot of people.
People like me, who believe in what you stand for... and people like Suzie, who are just beginning to.
You can't quit.
You can't let them down.
No, I suppose I shouldn't.
Who knows, maybe someday the Sawyers will be in here... instead of out there.
You're right.
I ought to be ashamed of myself.
Even if we can't win, we can go down swinging.
Let's get out of here.
Now, wait a minute.
You're forgetting you flunked your examination but good.
Oh, yes, I forgot.
I said Calvin Coolidge was the first president.
I can imagine what they're thinking of me for saying that.
But you'll get me out of this.
You'll think of something.
It's not gonna be easy, Kris.
It will be for you.
I believe you're the greatest lawyer since Darrow.
Just a second, Kris.
You're putting me in a bad spot.
But I believe in you.
You can't let me down.
But you don't understand. It...
I'll do everything I can, Kris.
Thank you.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
That's a lot of nonsense!
Dangerous, my foot!
I don't care if he failed ten examinations.
You had no right to do it!
You get the case dropped tomorrow... or you might have another lump to match the one Kris gave you!
Yes, Mr. Macy.
Age unknown.
Old man, huh?
Very old, Your Honor.
I suppose
I'll have to read all this.
Take my word for it.
Just routine commitment papers.
Cut and dried.
The man calls himself
Kris Kringle... thinks he's Santa Claus.
Uh-oh.
Come in.
Mr. Gailey to see you,
Your Honor.
He represents Mr. Kringle.
Better show him in.
Good morning.
Your Honor, there seems to be undue haste in this case.
I wish to protect my client's rights, as I'm sure you do.
Of course.
I request a formal hearing... to which I may bring witnesses.
- This is cut and dried?
- That's what I was told.
I didn't know anything about a protest.
Of course, you may sign the commitment papers now... but I'll bring a habeas corpus later.
There's no point in signing.
We'll have a hearing on Monday morning at 10:00.
Thank you. Good day.
Thank you.
That man...
I heard him say something about Mr. Kringle before.
Who is he?
His name is Gailey,
Kringle's lawyer.
Probably grabbed the case to get some cheap publicity.
We can't have that.
Mr. Macy would rather drop this.
It can't be done.
It's too late now.
Kringle has been examined by city hospital psychiatrists.
It has to follow due process.
We must avoid publicity.
I, uh... Oh.
Mr. Gailey,
I represent Mr. Macy.
My name's Sawyer.
Oh, so you're Sawyer.
Yes.
Regarding this Kringle matter...
We're very anxious to avoid any publicity.
Naturally.
So if you would agree to put this through quietly... we'd surely find a generous way to express our appreciation.
Very interesting.
Then you'll cooperate?
Very interesting.
Publicity. Hmm.
That's not a bad idea.
If I'm going to win this case...
I'll have to have plenty of public opinion.
And publicity's just the way to do it.
Thanks, Mr. Sawyer.
Oh, Mr. Gailey, wait a minute.
Mr. Gailey, one moment, please!
I don't see what they're making a fuss about.
After all, he's an old man.
How've you been feeling lately?
You look a little run-down.
Me? Why, I feel fine.
Never better.
Why not see the doc?
Take a few weeks off.
Go fishing, go hunting.
Go anyplace.
Why should I?
Because this Kringle case is dynamite.
Let some judge handle it that isn't coming up for reelection.
I can't do that.
I'm no legal brain trust.
I don't know a habeas from a corpus.
But I do know politics.
That's my racket.
I got you elected, didn't I?
And I'm gonna try to get you reelected.
I appreciate everything that you've done for me.
Then get off this case.
But why?
You're a Pontius Pilate the minute you start.
Oh, I don't believe it.
I'm an honest man... and nobody's going to hold it against me... for doing my duty as I see it.
Grandma!
Grandma!
Grandma!
Good night, Terry.
Good night, Alice.
Now, straight to bed.
I promised your mother you'd be in bed by 8:00... and it's way past.
Aren't you coming, too?
I'll be up soon to tuck you in. Now, scoot!
How about a great big kiss for Grandpa, hmm?
Hmmph!
Hmmph!
Fine way to treat their grandfather!
No hug, no kiss, no anything.
I don't blame them.
Any man who'd put Santa Claus on trial for lunacy.
See what I mean?
Hey.
Don't worry about me.
I've got the best lawyer in the worid.
How long do you think this will take?
Maybe a week.
A week?! That seems impossible!
That lawyer won't be stupid enough... to let him admit anything.
He'll deny everything.
I'll bring witnesses, and he'll bring witnesses.
Hear ye, hear ye.
All persons having business... with the supreme court of the county of New York... draw near, give attendance, and ye shall be heard.
You have Kris Kringle's commitment papers.
I'd like to call the first witness.
Mr. Kringle, will you take the stand?
Good morning, Your Honor.
You do solemnly swear... the testimony you'll give shall be the whole truth... so help you God?
I do.
Before you begin, I want to explain to the witness... this is a hearing, not a trial.
Mr. Kringle... you don't have to answer against your wishes... or even testify at all.
We have no objection,
Your Honor.
I'll be glad to answer any questions I can.
What is your name?
Kris Kringle.
Where do you live?
That's what this hearing will decide.
A very sound answer,
Mr. Kringle.
Do you believe that you're Santa Claus?
Of course.
The state rests, Your Honor.
Well, Mr. Gailey... do you wish to cross-examine the witness?
I believe he was employed to play Santa Claus.
Perhaps he didn't understand the question correctly.
Oh, I understood perfectly,
Your Honor.
No further questions at this time.
Thank you.
In view of this statement... do you still wish to put in a defense?
I do, Your Honor.
I'm fully aware of my client's opinions.
That's the entire case against him.
All these complicated tests boil down to this:
Mr. Kringle is not sane... because he believes himself to be Santa Claus.
An entirely logical... and reasonable assumption,
I'm afraid.
It would be if the clerk,
Mr. Marrah, or I... believed we were Santa Claus.
Anyone who thinks he's Santa Claus is not sane.
Not necessarily.
You believe yourself to be Judge Harper... yet no one questions your sanity because you are Judge Harper.
I know all about myself, young man.
Mr. Kringle is the subject of this hearing.
Yes, Your Honor... and if he is the person he believes himself to be... just as you are, then he's just as sane.
Granted, but he isn't.
Oh, but he is.
Is what?
I intend to prove that Mr. Kringle is Santa Claus.
He's crazy, too!
Hi, darling.
Sorry I'm late. Get your coat.
I reserved our table at Luigi's.
We're gonna celebrate.
What are we celebrating?
Read all about it.
"Gailey Throws Court Bombshell."
Yes, I read that.
I didn't see this...
Front page! Good. Good.
You're not serious about this?
Of course I am.
But you can't possibly prove he's Santa Claus.
Why not? You saw Macy and Gimbel shaking hands.
That wasn't possible either, but it happened.
It's the best defense I can use.
Completely logical and completely unexpected.
And completely idiotic.
What about your bosses...
Haislip and Mackenzie and the rest?
What do they say?
That I'm jeopardizing the prestige and dignity... of an old, established law firm... and either I drop this impossible case immediately... or they will drop me.
I beat them to it. I quit.
Fred, you didn't.
Of course I did.
I can't let Kris down.
He needs me, and all the rest of us need him.
Darling, he's a nice old man... and I admire you for wanting to help him... but you've got to be realistic and face facts.
You can't just throw your career away... because of a sentimental whim.
But I'm not throwing my career away.
If Haislip feels that way... so will every other law firm.
I'm sure they will.
I'll open my own office.
What kind of cases will you get?
Probably people like
Kris who are being bullied.
That's the only fun in law anyway.
If you believe in me and have faith in me... everything will...
You don't have any faith in me, do you?
It's not about faith.
It's just common sense.
Faith is believing in things... when common sense tells you not to.
It's not just Kris that's on trial.
It's everything he stands for.
It's kindness, joy, love, and all other intangibles.
Fred, you're talking like a child.
You're living in a realistic worid!
Those lovely intangibles aren't worth much.
You don't get ahead that way.
That all depends on what you call getting ahead.
Evidently, we have different definitions.
We've talked about wonderful plans.
Then you go on an idealistic binge.
You give up your job, throw away your security... and then you expect me to be happy about it!
Yes,
I guess I expected too much.
Someday, you're going to find out... that your way of facing this realistic worid... just doesn't work.
And when you do... don't overlook those lovely intangibles.
You'll discover they're the only things... that are worthwhile.
These reporters make me look like a sadistic monster... who likes to drown cats... and tear the wings off butterflies.
Why, this old man...
Tommy, go get mother's scissors, will you?
They're in the bedroom.
That's a good boy.
I don't want to discuss this case in front of him.
It'll break his heart.
While we're on the subject,
I agree with the reporters.
Mr. Kringle seems to be a nice old man.
I don't see why you have to keep persecuting him.
Firstly,
I am not persecuting him.
I am prosecuting him.
And secondly,
I like the old man, too.
I wish
I'd never gotten into this.
But it's too late now. There's nothing I can do about it.
It's up to the state of New York.
I'm their duly appointed legal representative.
Kringle has been declared a menace to society... by competent doctors.
It's my duty to protect the state of New York... and see that he's put away.
No matter what they say about me...
I've got to do it.
Sometimes I wish I'd married a butcher or a plumber.
Well, my dear, if I lose this case... it's very possible that you'll get your wish.
Hello, Kris.
Your name?
R.H. Macy.
You are the owner... of one of the biggest department stores... in New York City?
The biggest.
Who is the gentleman seated there?
Kris Kringle.
- Your employee?
- Yes.
Do you believe him to be truthful?
Yes.
You believe him to be of sound mind?
I certainly do.
Mr. Macy, you're under oath.
You really believe this man is Santa Claus?
Well, I...
Well, he gives every indication...
Do you really believe he's Santa Claus?
I do.
You do?
That's all.
Psychologist!
Where'd you graduate from, a correspondence school?
You're fired.
Your Honor,
I object to this testimony.
It's ridiculous, irrelevant, and immaterial.
Mr. Gailey is making a circus of this court.
There is no such person as Santa Claus... and everybody knows it.
I submit it's purely a matter of opinion.
Can Mr. Marrah disprove
Santa's existence?
No. I don't intend to.
This isn't a nursery. It's the
New York State Supreme Court.
I'll not waste this court's time with such nonsense!
Mr. Marrah seems to have appointed himself judge.
He's ruling on what testimony
I may introduce.
We request an immediate ruling from this court.
Is there or is there not a Santa Claus?
Well...
Ahem!
The court will take a recess to consider the matter.
I don't care what you do with old whisker puss... but if you rule that there's no Santa Claus... you better start looking for that chicken farm.
We won't even be able to put you in the primaries.
But, Charley, listen to reason.
I'm a responsible judge.
I've taken an oath.
How can I seriously rule there is a Santa Claus?
Why don't you...
All right.
Tell them the New York
State Supreme Court rules... there's no Santa Claus.
It's all over the papers.
The kids don't hang up their stockings.
Now, what happens to all the toys... that are supposed to be in those stockings?
Nobody buys them.
The toy manufacturers are going to like that.
So they have to lay off a lot of their employees... union employees.
Now you got the C.I.O.
And the A.F.L. against you.
And they're gonna adore you for it.
And they're gonna say it with votes.
And the department stores will love you, too... and the Christmas card makers... and the candy companies.
Oh, Henry, you're going to be an awful popular fellow.
And what about the Salvation Army?
Why, they got a Santa Claus on every corner... and they take in a fortune.
But you go ahead, Henry.
You do it your way.
You go on back in there and tell them... that you rule there's no Santa Claus.
But if you do, remember this:
You can count on getting just two votes... your own and that district attorney's out there.
The district attorney's a Republican.
All rise!
Before making a ruling... this court has consulted the highest authority available.
The question of Santa Claus... seems to be largely a matter of opinion.
Many people firmly believe in him.
Others do not.
The tradition of American justice demands... a broad, unprejudiced view of such a controversial matter.
This court, therefore, intends to keep an open mind.
I'll hear all the evidence.
He's crazy, too.
The burden of proof for this ridiculous contention... clearly rests with my opponent.
Can he produce evidence to support his views?
If Your Honor pleases, I can.
Will Thomas Marrah please take the stand?
Who, me?
Thomas Marrah, Jr.
Hello, Daddy.
Here you are, Tommy.
Tommy, you know the difference... between telling the truth and telling a lie, right?
Everybody knows you shouldn't tell a lie... especially in court.
Proceed, Mr. Gailey.
Do you believe in Santa Claus?
Sure I do.
He gave me a brand-new flexible flyer sled last year.
And what does he look like?
There he is, sitting there.
Your Honor, I protest!
Overruled.
Tell me, Tommy... why are you so sure there's a Santa Claus?
Because my daddy told me so.
Didn't you, Daddy?
You believe your daddy, don't you?
He's a very honest man.
Of course he is.
My daddy wouldn't tell me anything that wasn't so.
Would you, Daddy?
Thank you, Tommy.
Good-bye, Daddy.
Your Honor...
Don't forget.
A real official football helmet.
Don't worry, Tommy.
You'll get it.
Your Honor, the state of New York... concedes the existence of Santa Claus.
But we ask that Mr. Gailey cease presenting... personal opinion as evidence.
We could bring witnesses with opposite opinions... but we desire to shorten this hearing... rather than prolong it.
I request that Mr. Gailey... now submit authoritative proof... that Mr. Kringle... is the one-and-only Santa Claus.
Your point's well taken.
I'm afraid we must agree.
Mr. Gailey, can you show that
Mr. Kringle is Santa Claus... on the basis of competent authority?
Not at this time, Your Honor.
I ask for an adjournment until tomorrow.
Court stands adjourned till tomorrow afternoon, 3:00.
Well, I guess that's that.
There's a way, Alfred.
There's got to be!
It's hard to explain.
They're having a trial about him.
You mean like for murder?
No, it isn't that kind of a trial.
It's just because he says he's Santa Claus.
I've got a feeling he is Santa Claus.
Some people don't believe that. That's why...
But he's so kind and nice and jolly.
He's not like anyone else.
He must be Santa.
I think perhaps you're right, Suzie.
Is Mr. Kringle sad now,
Mother?
I'm afraid he is.
I'm sure he misses you.
Then I'll write him a letter and cheer him up.
Hey, Lou, come here!
Yeah?
Here's a new one.
I seen them write to Santa Claus...
North Pole, South Pole, and every other place.
This kid writes...
"Kris Kringle,
New York County Courthouse."
The kid's right.
They got him on trial there.
He claims he's Santa Claus, and the D.A. Claims he's nuts.
Read it for yourself.
Right on the front page.
Hey, Lou, how many Santa Claus letters... we got at the dead-letter office?
I don't know.
There must be about 50,000 of them.
Bags and bags all over the joint.
And there's more coming in every day.
Yeah. Hey, Lou.
It'd be nice to get rid of them, huh?
Yeah, but...
Hey, that's a wonderful idea!
Why should we be bothered with all that stuff?
Why not get some trucks?
Big ones right away.
Load them with Santa Claus mail and deliver it... to Mr. Kringle at the courthouse.
Let somebody else worry about it, huh?
Hey! Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Hello, Kris.
Fred.
Kris, I'm afraid
I've got bad news for you.
I've tried every way to get some competent authority.
I've wired the governor, the mayor. I even...
This is worth more to me... than all the governors and mayors in the worid.
It's all over. Look at him.
He hasn't got a thing.
And furthermore, the defense has yet to offer... one concrete piece of evidence... to substantiate this preposterous claim.
Not one authoritative proof that this man is Santa Claus.
In view of these facts... and especially since today is Christmas Eve... we're, naturally, all anxious to get home...
I ask that you sign the commitment papers... without further delay.
Mr. Gailey... have you anything further to offer?
Yes, I have, Your Honor.
I'd like to submit the following facts in evidence.
It concerns the Post Office Department... an official agency of the United States government.
"The Post Office Department was created...
"by the Second
Continental Congress...
"on July 26, 1776.
"The first postmaster general was Benjamin Franklin.
"The Post Office...
"is one of the worid's largest business concerns.
"Last year, under Robert Hannigan...
"it did a gross business of $1,112,877,174."
We're all gratified to know... the Post Office is doing nicely... but it hardly has any bearing on this case.
It has a great deal, Your Honor, if I may be allowed to proceed.
By all means, Mr. Gailey.
Your Honor, the figures
I have just quoted... indicate an efficiently run organization.
United States postal laws and regulations... make it a criminal offense to willfully misdirect mail... or intentionally deliver it to the wrong party.
Consequently... the Department uses every possible precaution.
The state of New York admires the Post Office.
It is efficient, authoritative, and prosperous.
We're happy to concede
Mr. Gailey's claims.
For the record?
For the record.
Anything to get this case going.
Then I want to introduce this evidence.
I'll take them, please.
I have three letters addressed simply "Santa Claus."
No other address whatsoever.
Yet these were just now delivered to Mr. Kringle... by bona fide employees of the Post Office.
I offer them as positive proof that...
Uh, three letters are hardly positive proof.
I understand the Post Office receives thousands of these.
I have further exhibits, but I hesitate to produce them.
We'll be very happy to see them.
Yes, yes.
Produce them, Mr. Gailey.
Put them here on my desk.
But, Your Honor...
Put them here on the desk.
Put them here.
Yes, Your Honor.
Your Honor!
Your Honor!
Your Honor... every one of these letters is addressed to Santa Claus.
The Post Office has delivered them.
Therefore, the Post Office... a branch of the federal government... recognizes this man,
Kris Kringle... to be the one-and-only
Santa Claus!
Since the United States government... declares this man to be Santa Claus... this court will not dispute it.
Case dismissed.
I've got to get that football helmet!
Thank you so much,
Your Honor... and a very merry Christmas to you.
Thank you, Mr. Kringle, and the same to you.
Thank you.
Kris.
I had to wait to tell you.
I got your note.
It made me very happy.
Oh, I'm so glad.
We're having a big Christmas party... at the Brooks' Home tomorrow morning.
Breakfast, a beautiful tree.
I'd like to have you and Susan.
Oh, thank you.
There's no one I'd rather spend Christmas with.
Would you like to come to dinner tonight?
Tonight? Oh, I can't.
It's Christmas Eve.
Oh, I forgot.
Bye.
Oh, my dear sir... you know my assistant Alfred,
Mr. Macy?
Merry Christmas, Alfred.
Mr. Macy!
Hello, Alfred.
Mr. Macy!
Kris, all I can say is the state supreme court... declared you to be Santa Claus... and personally and professionally...
I agree with them.
But there are lots of presents there for you.
Not the one I wanted.
Not the one Mr. Kringle was going to get for me.
Well, what was that?
It doesn't matter.
I didn't get it.
I knew it wouldn't be here... but I thought there'd be a letter.
I don't suppose you even want to talk to me.
Something about a present.
Yes, I know.
I'm sorry, Suzie.
I tried my best, but...
You couldn't get it because you're not Santa.
You're just a nice old man with whiskers... like my mother said... and I shouldn't have believed you.
I was wrong when I told you that.
You must believe in Mr. Kringle and keep right on doing it.
You must have faith in him.
But he didn't get me the...
That doesn't make sense, Mommy.
Faith is believing in things... when common sense tells you not to.
Huh?
Just because things don't turn out... the way you want them to the first time... you've still got to believe in people.
I found that out.
You mean like...
"If at first you don't succeed, try, try again"?
Yes.
I thought so.
May I drive you home?
Thank you.
If you'll go this way, you'll miss a lot of traffic.
You go along Maplewood until you've come to Ashley...
I believe. I believe.
It's silly, but I believe.
Thanks, Kris.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas to you.
And to you, my dear, and many of them.
Good-bye, my dear.
Good-bye, Mrs. Walker.
Good-bye, Alfred.
Good-bye, Suzie.
This must be the turn here.
That's right. Ashley.
Now you go straight for four blocks.
I believe. I believe.
Stop, Uncle Fred! Stop!
Stop! Stop!
Suzie!
Suzie!
Suzie, where are you going?
What is she doing?
- Suzie!
- Suzie!
Suzie, where are you?
I'm upstairs!
You shouldn't run around in other people's houses.
You know better than that.
But this is my house, the one I asked Mr. Kringle for.
It is! I know it is!
My room upstairs is like
I knew it would be!
You were right, Mommy.
Mommy said if things don't turn out right at first... you've still got to believe.
I kept believing.
You were right, Mommy!
Mr. Kringle is Santa Claus!
Where are you going?
To see if there's a swing!
There is one! There is one!
You told her that?
The sign outside said it's for sale.
We can't let her down.
I never really doubted you.
It was just my silly common sense.
It even makes sense to believe in me now.
I must be a pretty good lawyer.
I take a little old man... and legally prove that he's Santa Claus.
Now, you know that...
Oh, no. It can't be.
It must have been left by the people that moved out.
Maybe.
Maybe I didn't do such a wonderful thing after all.
Well, these are certainly the cleanest steps on Madison Avenue.
That's how Mr. Day wants them kept.
Good morning.
Good morning.
You're new here, aren't you?
Just this morning.
This is the way Mr. Day gets his milk.
Annie, be careful of this dish.
You can burn your hand.
And keep the cover on till you're ready to serve them.
Mr. Day likes his muffins hot.
I'll do that.
Annie, is the table set for breakfast?
Yes ma'am.
Good morning, ma'am.
Good morning, Annie.
How are you getting along?
All right, ma'am, I hope.
Now don't be nervous just because this is your first day.
Everything's going to be all right.
But I do hope nothing goes wrong.
Oh no, Annie.
The cream and sugar go down at this end.
I thought everyone could reach it from here.
Mr. Day sits here.
Excuse me.
I didn't know where to place the napkins, ma'am.
You can tell by the rings.
The boys have their initials.
C for Clarence.
He sits here.
J for John, here.
W for Whitney.
He sits over there next to his father.
And the one with a little dog on it is Harlan's, of course. He's the baby.
This narrow plain one is mine.
And this is Mr. Day's.
It's just like mine except that it got bent... one morning.
And that reminds me, Annie.
Always have Mr. Day's coffee piping hot.
Yes, ma'am.
And whenever Mr. Day speaks to you, just say Yes sir.
Don't be nervous. You'll get used to him.
Yes, ma'am.
Oh, that beautiful rubber plant.
I'm so glad it came.
You mustn't water it every day.
Too much moisture makes it very unhappy.
Well good morning, Mother.
I thought you were still upstairs.
Good morning, Clarence.
Father must be talking to himself.
A redhead!
Did you sleep well, Mother?
Yes, thank you, dear.
Golly I'm hungry.
Oh and Annie, we always start with fruit in the morning.
Except the two younger boys who have their porridge and milk.
Jiminy! Another wreck on the New Haven!
That always disturbs the stock market.
Father won't like that.
I do wish the New Haven would stop having wrecks.
If they knew how it upsets your father.
My soul and body! Clarence, what's happened to your coat?
Oh it ripped open again.
Margaret mended it for me but it won't stay mended.
Oh dear. I'll just have to speak to your father about a new suit of clothes.
Clarence, why did you take my H2SO4 out of our clothes closet?
I've told you a hundred times that closet's not to make experiments in.
Two?
Good morning, Mother.
John, have you been making those chemical smells again?
No, Mother,
I'm making an electric battery.
It'll ring a bell and everything.
You know your father doesn't like electricity.
But Mother, everything's going to be electricity.
Not in this house.
Oh God!
What's the matter, Clare?
What's wrong?
Where's my necktie?
Which necktie?
The one I gave you yesterday.
It isn't pressed yet.
I forgot to give it to Margaret.
I told you distinctly I wanted to wear that necktie today.
You've got plenty of neckties.
Put on another one right away and come down to breakfast.
I don't know what this world's coming to.
Mother, may I have my breakfast early.
I'm going to play baseball.
Three!
Whitney, before you leave the house you have to study your catechism.
But Mother, they're going to let me pitch today.
Good morning. Who won?
Giants, 7 to 3.
Buck Ewing hit a home run!
Let me see!
Boys, don't wrinkle the paper before your father sees it.
Mother, could you ask me my catechism now?
I think I know it.
Well, let's see.
What is your name?
Whitney Benjamin.
Who gave you your...
Here I come...weeeeeee.
Come and help me down, Mother.
We have steps to come down on.
Good morning, darling.
Good morning, Mother.
How's your finger?
It itches.
Good. That's a sign it's getting better.
Come along.
Four!
Oh let's see. What was I doing?
Oh yes, the Catechism.
Who gave you your name?
My sponsors at baptism wherein I was made a member of Christ, the child of God, and an inheritor of the kingdom of heaven.
Mother, if I hadn't been baptized, wouldn't I have any name?
Not in the sight of the church.
What did your sponsors then for you?
They did promise and vow three thing in my name.
First, that I should renouce the devil and...
[continues speaking in background]
And thirdly, that I should keep God's holy will and commandments and walk in the same all the days of my...
Morning, boys.
Morning.
Good morning, Father.
Morning, Vinnie.
Have a good night?
Yes, thank you, Clare.
Good. Get down, boys.
What's that thing doing in here?
Clare, that's our new rubber plant.
Place for rubber plants is on the equator.
Uh, take that object out, Katherine.
You're not Katherine.
No, sir.
Good. Never liked Katherine anyway.
Put it somewhere else, Annie, but not too near a window.
Sit down, Harlan.
Thank you, dear.
Where did that dog come from?
She'll leave. I'll talk to her.
What did you say?
Clare, that new suit looks very nice.
A triffle tight.
You've put on a little weight, dear.
I weigh just the same as I always have.
Well, Clarence has just managed to ruin the only decent suit he has.
I'm sorry but I'm afraid he'll need a new suit of clothes.
Vinnie, Clarence has to learn not to be so hard on his clothes.
But Father, I thought...
You'll be starting at Yale in the fall.
You'll be completely outfitted.
But nothing this summer.
Can I have one of your old suits cut down for me?
Every suit I own still has plenty of wear in it.
I wear my clothes until they're worn out.
Well, if you want your clothes worn out, Clarence can wear them out much faster than you can.
Yes, and Father, you never get a chance to wear yours out.
Every time you get a new batch of clothes,
Mother sends the old ones to the missionary barrel.
I guess I'm just as good as any old missionary.
Clarence, before you compare yourself to a missionary, remember the sacrifices they make.
Oh I don't know, Vinnie.
I think my clothes would look better on Clarence than on some Hottentot.
Have that dark suit of mine cut down to fit you.
Well thank you, Father.
One of Father's suits.
Thank you, sir.
In return for that, Clarence,
I want you to practice more often on your violin.
Whitney, don't eat so fast.
Well Father,
I'm going to pitch today.
But before I go,
I have to study my catechism.
What do you bother with that for?
Because if he doesn't know his catechism, he can't be confirmed.
But Vinnie, Whitney's going to pitch today.
He can be confirmed any old time.
Clare, sometimes it seems to me you don't care whether your children get to heaven or not.
Oh, Whitney will get to heaven alright.
I'll be there before you are, Whitney.
I'll see that you get in.
And Whitney, when we get to heaven, we'll organize a baseball team of our own.
Good.
It would be just like you to try and run things up there.
Well, from all I've heard about heaven, it seems to be a pretty unbusiness-like place.
They could probably use good man like me.
What makes you so sure they'll let you in to heaven?
Well if they don't,
I'll certainly raise a devil of a row!
Clare, I do hope you'll behave when you get to heaven.
Now Vinnie, what...
Vinnie, how many times have I asked you not to engage a maid who doesn't know how to serve properly?
Clare, can't you see she's new and doing her best?
How can I serve myself when she's holding that platter over my head?
Hold it lower, Annie.
Yes, ma'am.
What became of the one we had yesterday?
I don't know why you can't keep a maid.
Oh you don't!
Why on earth can't you run your house the way I run my office?
All I want is service.
[Annie weeping]
What the devil is that noise?
It's Annie.
Annie? Who's Annie?
The maid.
I'll take it, Annie.
Clare, aren't you ashamed of yourself?
What have I done now?
You made her cry, speaking to her the way you did.
I never said a word to her.
I was addressing myself to you.
I do wish you'd be more careful!
It's hard enough to keep a maid and the uniform just fit this one.
[stomping foot]
What's the matter, Clare? What's wrong?
[dog barks]
What in the name of...
Well!
Where did you come from?
Who do you belong to?
She's mine, Father.
Her name is Princess.
Hmmm, looks more like a Prince to me.
What's wrong, sir?
Margaret, this bacon's good!
Ohh...
Well it's good! Yes sir.
Harlan, how's that finger?
Come here and let me see it.
Yes, Father.
Ah, that's healing nicely.
I guess you'll know the next time that cats don't like to be hugged.
It's alright to stroke them but don't squeeze them.
Now go back and finish your oatmeal.
I don't like oatmeal.
Go on and finish it. it's good for you.
But I don't like it!
I'll tell you what you like and what you don't like.
You're not old enough to know about such things.
You've no business not liking oatmeal.
It's good.
I hate it!
That's enough! We won't discuss it!
Eat that oatmeal at once!
Aghhh...
[stomping floor]
John, that letter's for your mother.
I finished my oatmeal, Father.
May I be excused?
Yes Whitney, you may go.
Pitch a good game.
I will.
Whitney!
Yes Mother, my catechism.
Never mind this morning, darling.
Run along.
Thank you, Mother!
What's wrong, sir?
Margaret, what is this?
Coffee, sir.
It is not coffee.
You couldn't possibly take water and coffee beans and arrive at that!
It's slops! That's what it is!
Slops! Take it away.
I come down to this table every morning hungry...
Well if you're hungry, Clare, why aren't you eating your breakfast?
I am.
Aunt Judith wants me to come up and vist her.
Now Vinnie,
I want no more relatives in this house.
We are going to live here by ourselves in peace and comfort.
Clare, I was saying,
Aunt Judith wants me to visit her.
Oh.
Eat your oatmeal, dear.
But what on earth is this?
Dear friend Day,
We are assigning you the exclusive rights to Staten Island for selling the Gem Home Popover Popcorn.
I think that's for me, Father.
But then why isn't it addressed to Clarence Day Jr?
Oh, it is.
I wouldn't get mixed up in popcorn,
Clarence. It's too indigestible.
Confound it!
Another wreck on the New Haven...
If you please, ma'am.
There's a dollar due on a package.
It's from Lewis and Congers.
Oh yes, those kitchen knives I ordered.
Ah, make a memorandum of that, Vinnie.
One dollar... and whatever it was for.
Of course, Clare.
I must have a record of what is spent running this house.
I've never understood what good a record is after the money's gone!
There's just a dollar, Margaret.
Vinnie, this house must be run on a business basis. Of course, dear.
That's what the household accounts are for.
Oh Clare, it's half past eight.
You don't want to be late at the office.
Plenty of time.
Annie, clear the table now.
Clarence. John.
Yes, Mother?
You boys go up and move the small bureau from my room into yours.
Who's coming?
Cousin Cora.
And she's bringing a friend with her, a young girl.
A girl!
You would have to help entertain her,
Clarence.
Oh Mother, do I have to?
Wait till Father finds out we've got visitors!
There'll be a rumpus!
John, don't criticise your father.
He's very hospitable... after he gets used to the idea.
I like coffee.
I like tea.
I like the girls and the girls like me.
Well, I don't like girls and they don't like me.
Oh God!
Go on, boys. Go on.
What's the matter, Clare?
What's wrong?
How did that get in this room?
Now, Clare.
How was the new maid to know?
Keep that abomination out of here.
All right, I'll take it.
Oh Clare dear, I'm afraid
I'm going to need some more money.
You were complaining about the coffee this morning.
Well, that nice French drip coffee pot is broken.
You know how it got broken.
Never mind that, Vinnie.
As I remember that coffee pot cost $5 and... something.
I'll give you $6.
When you get it, Vinnie, enter the exact amount in the ledger.
Of course, Clare.
We can't go on month after month having the household accounts in such a mess.
No, and I thought of a system that will make my bookkeeping perfect!
Well, I'm certainly relieved to hear that!
All we have to do is open charge accounts everywhere!
And the stores will do my bookkeeping for me!
Now wait a minute, Vinne...
Then when the bills come in you'd know exactly where your money had gone!
Yes! I certainly would!
Vinnie, we get enough bills as it is!
Clare dear, don't you hate those arguments we have every month?
I certainly do.
Not to have those I should think would be worth something to you.
Well, I'll open an account at Lewis and Congers and one at McCreery's to start with.
Thank you, Clare.
We'll see how it works out.
Thank you.
Oh, the rector is coming to tea today.
The rector.
Well, I'm glad you warned me.
I'll go to the club. Don't expect me home until dinner time.
Clare dear, I do wish you'd take a little more interest in the church.
Getting me into heaven is your business, Vinnie.
If there's anything wrong with my ticket when I get there, you can fix it up.
Everybody loves you so much,
I'm sure God must too.
I'll do my best, Clare.
It wouldn't be heaven without you.
If you're there, Vinnie,
I'll manage to get in some way, even if I have to climb the fence.
♪ Sweet Marie, come to me,
Come to me, sweet Marie ♪
Margaret. Margaret.
Oh God!
What's the matter, Clare?
What's wrong?
Why did God make so many dumb fools and Democrats?
Uhh, politics...
Yes, but it's taking the bread out of our mouths!
Honest Hugh Grant!
Honest, bahh!
Fine mayor you've turned out to be!
If you can't run this city without raising taxes every five minutes, you'd better get out!
Let someone who can!
Richard Cook is running in this town and you're just his cat's paw!
Tell me this...
Are these increased taxes going into public improvements?
Or are they going into graft?
Answer me that honestly, if you can, Mr. Honest Hugh Grant!
You can't?
I thought so! Baah!
You were elected to office on the promise that you would put an end to all this thievery and corruption!
Have you put an end to it?
No!
You've encouraged it!
Every day there's some new raid on the public treasury!
[multiple conversations]
...we're going to throw you and your boodle Board of Aldermen out of office!
I'm warning you for the last time!
Robbery! That's what it is!
Highway robbery!
Annie, take this fresh a cup of coffee in to Mr. Day.
But Mr. Day's got a visitor.
Run along in there.
We pay you a good round sum to watch after our interests.
And all we get is inefficiency!
I know you're a nincompoop and I strongly suspect you of being a scalawag!
You're not going to escape your legal responsibilities!
Legal responsibilities?
By God, I mean criminal responsibilities!
Don't think for one minute we're going to let you escape!
We're going to throw you into jail!
[dishes breaking]
Annie, are you hurt?
He can't throw me into jail!
Vinnie? Vinnie, why can't
I have quiet here in the morning?
Clare, what happened?
Sounded to me as tho that maid dropped a whole tray of dishes!
Yes, but what did you say to her?
Say to her?
I haven't seen her since breakfast!
I better get to the office.
Oh yes Clare, you don't want to be late.
I'll be home in plenty of time for dinner.
Why don't we have chicken fricassee tonight?
Well, Clare, chicken's gone up!
It's 8 cents a pound!
[Annie crying]
Where the devil is she going dressed up like that?
Clare, you've done it again!
How could you?
How could I what?
Can't you see she's leaving?
Oh dear.
I have no time to engage a new maid.
We'll have to have dinner out.
Dinner out!
Nonsense!
I'll engage a new maid myself.
Clare, you can't!
She has to fit the uniform.
I have one here in an hour!
Goodbye, dear.
Goodbye, Clare.
Good morning, Mr. Day.
On your way to the office?
Yes, Sergeant. Good morning.
Mrs. Day.
Good morning, Mr. Day.
Morning, Jim.
Giddap!
Cora, it's wonderful to see you.
Well Vinnie, I declare, you're getting younger and pretier every year!
This is Mary Skinner.
Ed Skinner's daughter!
My goodness I never would have known you!
Just leave your things out here and come right on in.
I heard my father talk so much about you.
Ah ha ha.
Did he tell you how he used to dip my pigtails in the ink well at school?
What's the news in Pleasantville, Cora?
Oh Vinnie, I have so much to tell you.
We wrote you that Aunt Carrie broke her hip.
Yes.
That was the night Robert Ingersoll lectured.
Of course she couldn't get there, but was a good thing for Mr. Ingersol she didn't!
How do you do, Cousin Cora?
Oh, Clarence, my my...
Oh no, Cora, this is John.
John? Why how you've grown!
You'll be a man before your mother...
John, this is Mary Skinner.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Vinnie, everybody in Pleasantville sends their love.
Grandpa Evans, Cousin Edith,
Aunt Hattie. the Taylors.
Oh, just everybody.
Cora, how is Grandpa Evans?
Oh, he hasn't been at all well.
You know he only has one kidney and that's bloated.
How do you do, Cousin Cora?
I'm glad to see you.
This can't be Clarence!
Yes it is!
My my!
My goodness!
Every time I see you boys, you've grown another foot!
Let's see, you're going to St. Paul's now, aren't you?
St. Paul's? I was through with
St. Paul's long ago.
I'm starting in Yale this fall.
Yale!
Oh, oh Mary, this is Clarence.
Mary Skinner.
How do you do?
Oh, this is Mary's first trip to New York.
Yes it is.
It's her first trip.
We'll have to show Mary around!
Oh I tell you, I'll ask Mr. Day to take us all to Delmonico's for dinner tonight.
Delmonico's!
Think of that, Mary.
Delmonico's,
And Cousin Clare's such a wonderful host.
Well. I know you girls want to freshen up, so come upstairs.
Clarence, get their bags.
I've given you girls Clarence's room, but he didn't know about it.
[chattering]
John, get their old bags.
[chattering]
Oh, you play the violin.
Well, I... I fool with it a little.
You're just being modest.
No, really I...
I play the piano.
Not awfully well.
Now you're being modest.
Do you ever play duets?
Well, I haven't up now.
Neither have I, up to now.
Cora didn't tell me about you.
I never met a Yale man before.
[giggling...]
What's happened to you?
Nothing. I feel fine.
Where do you keep them?
Do you wish domestic servants?
Where do you keep them?
I will take your name and address.
Confound it!
I'm late at the office now!
If you will give me the details as to what kind of person you require...
I'm asking you where you keep them?
Why the girls are in there, but clients are not allowed in that room.
If you will tell me the kind of a position you wish to have held,
I'll be very glad to...
Stand up...
Sir, this is quite against the rules!
I must know what you want the girl for!
I'll take that one.
What's your name?
Hilda, sir.
Hilda, you go right over to
420 Madison Avenue.
I will, sir.
That's all. Thank you.
Sir, before I can let any girl go from this establishment,
I must know the character of the home in which he will be employed.
Madam, I am the character of my home.
My duty toward my neighbor is to love him as myself and to do unto all men as...as...
...as they should do unto me...
...as they should do unto me, to...to...
He really knows it.
Well, he's done very well for so young a boy.
May I go now?
Yes, darling.
Thank you, Dr. Lloyd.
Come on, Harlan.
Wait for me.
Ah, you and Mr. Day must be very proud of your children.
I was hoping I'd find
Mr. Day at home this afternoon.
Well, he's usually home from the office by this time.
Perhaps he's gone for gallop in the park.
It's such a fine day.
He's very fond of horseback riding,
I believe.
Oh yes.
Tell me, has he ever been thrown from a horse?
Oh no, no horse would throw Mr. Day!
I just thought he might have had some accident.
I notice he never kneels in church.
Oh, that's no accident.
But I don't want you to think he doesn't pray.
He does.
Why, sometimes you can hear him all over the house!
But he never kneels.
Ah, perhaps that's Mr. Day now.
I hardly think so.
Ah, the devil!
I forgot!
Clare, you're just in time for tea.
I'll send for some hot water.
How are you, Dr. Lloyd?
Just a brief second to have a visit with you, Mr. Day.
Mother, are they back yet?
No, Clarence, no.
Except for a brief glimpse on the sabbath,
I don't see much of you.
Well, Clare, have a busy day at the office?
Devilishly busy!
Clare!
Ah...very busy day. Tired out.
How a man can get tired just sitting at a desk all day, I don't know!
I suppose Wall Street is just as much a mystery to you as it is to me, Dr. Lloyd.
No, no. It's all very clear to me.
My mind often goes to the businessman.
The picture I'm most fond on is when
I envision him at the close of the day's work.
I see him pausing in his toil and it comes over him that all those figures of profit and loss are without importance or consequence.
Vanity and dust.
Well, I'll be...
Clare!
Yes ma'am?
Delia, some more hot water, please.
Yes ma'am.
Who's that?
The new maid.
Where's the one I sent this morning?
The uniform didn't fit.
I like the one I picked out better.
Clare, Dr. Lloyd wants to tell us about the plans for the new edifice.
The new what?
The new church.
You knew we were planning to build a new church.
Of course, we're going to have to raise a large sum money.
Well, personally I am against the church hop skipping and jumping all over the town.
So any contribution I make will have to be a small one.
The amount everyone is to subscribe has already been decided.
Who decided it?
After considerable thought, we voted that our supporting members should each contribute a sum equal to the cost of their pew.
I paid $5,000 for my pew!
Yes, Clare.
That makes our contribution $5000.
That's robbery!
Do you know what that pew is worth today?
That's what the last one sold for.
I've taken a dead loss of $2000 on that pew already!
Frank Bags sold me that pew when the market was at its peak!
He knew when to get out!
And I'm warning you, Vinnie, if the market ever goes up,
I'm going to unload that pew!
Clarence Day!
How can you speak of the temple of the Lord as though it was something to be bought and sold on Wall Street?
Now Mrs. Day, your husband is a practical man.
We've had to be practical about the new church.
We have all the facts and figures.
Oh, what's the property worth where we are now?
Oh, let's see. Is it $40,000?
I know the figure has a 4 in it.
What's the new piece of property going to cost you?
I think the figure I heard mentioned was $85,000.
Or was it $185,000?
Dr. Lloyd, you preach that someday we'll all have to answer to God.
We shall indeed!
Well, I hope God doesn't ask you any questions with figures in them!
Mr. Day is in the living room.
Thank you.
It's Cousin Cora.
She's passing through town.
Oh, well...
Oh, hello. Hello. Hello.
Thank you for helping me. Come, Mary.
Oh Vinnie, what a day!
We've been in every shop in town!
Why, Cousin Clare.
Cora.
My my!
You're as welcome as the flowers in May.
This is Mary Skinner.
Mr. Day.
How do you do?
I've been telling Mary all about you.
She's been dying to meet you.
Well...
Dr. Lloyd, I want you to meet my favorite cousin, Miss Cartwright.
How do you do?
And this is Mary Skinner.
Miss Skinner, Dr. Lloyd.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Well, this seems to be a family reunion.
I'll just run along.
Goodbye, Dr. Lloyd.
Goodbye, Miss Cartwright.
Goodbye.
Clarence, you haven't said
'how do you do' to Dr. Lloyd.
Goodbye, Dr. Lloyd.
Goodbye, everybody.
I'll go to the door with you, Dr. Lloyd.
Thank you so much for the tea.
Those muffins were delicious.
Who did you say this pretty little girl is?
She's Ed Skinner's daughter.
This is Mary's first trip to New York.
Oh sit down. Sit down.
Have some tea.
We had tea downtown.
Oh, never mind then, ah...Delia.
Sit down, sit down.
Even if you have had tea, you can stay and visit for a while.
As a matter of fact, why don't you both stay to dinner.
That's all arranged, Clare.
Cora and Mary are going to have dinner with us.
Oh fine, fine.
Of course, you'll just have to take potluck.
Well, I'd hardly call...
Clare! Did you know the girls are going to visit Aunt Judith in Springfield for a whole month!
Fine.
Now, how long you are you going to be in New York, Cora?
All week!
Splendid!
We'll hope to see something of you.
Well, you certainly will...
Cora, did you find anything you wanted in the shop?
Oh, I can't wait to show you.
Oh, but I'm afraid some of these packages can't be opened in front of Cousin Clare!
Shall I leave the room?
[laughing]
Oh, Clarence. Would you take the packages in the hall up to our room?
Or should I say, your room!
Wasn't it nice of Clarence to give up his room to us for a whole week!
Cora, come on I just can't wait to see what's in those packages.
Well, we'll be back soon.
Ah, Vinnie, I wish to speak to you before you go upstairs.
I'll be down in just a minute, Clare.
I wish to speak to you now!
I'll be up in just a minute, Cora.
It's all right, Vinnie.
Come along, Mary.
Are those two women encamped in our house?
Now, Clare...
Answer me!
Now Clare, you know...
Answer me!
Just a minute... Clarence!
Now Clare, you know you've always been fond of Cora.
What's that got to do with her packing herself down in my house and bringing hordes of strangers with her.
How can you call that sweet little girl a horde of strangers?
Why don't they go to a hotel?
New York is full of hotels built for the express purpose of housing such nuisances.
Clare two girls alone in a hotel!
Well who knows what might happen to them!
All right, then put them on the first train.
They want to roam like gypsies, lend them a hand!
Keep them roaming!
But Clare, they're just staying in that little room of Clarence's.
The trouble is, they don't stay there!
They stay in the bathroom.
Every time I want to take my bath, it's full of gigling females washing their hair!
I tell you, I won't have it!
Send them to a hotel!
I'll pay the bill gladly, but get them out of here!
Father, I'm afraid they can hear you upstairs!
Then keep those doors closed!
Clarence, you open those doors!
Open them all the way!
Now Clare, you be quiet and behave yourself.
They're here, and they're going to stay here.
That's enough, Vinnie.
I want no more of this argument.
Oh God!
What I don't understand is why this swarm of locusts always descends on us without any warning!
Oh thunder!
Vinnie...
Dear Vinnie.
[♪ playing piano and humming... ♪]

Father, may I go along with the rest of you to Delmonico's?
What's that?
Delmonico's?
You're taking Mother, Cousin Cora and Miss Skinner to Delmonico's for dinner tonight.
Oh God!
[slams piano keys]
I won't have it!
I won't have it!
I will not have my life arranged for me!
I bought this house for my own comfort!
I will not submit myself to this indignity!
Now Clare, what's the matter?
I won't stand it!
By heaven, I won't stand it!
Clarence...
Do I understand I am not permitted to have dinner in my own home?
Oh Clare, a little change will do you good!
I have home to have dinner in.
And any time I can't have dinner at home, this house is for sale.
Well Clare, you can't have dinner here tonight because it isn't ordered.
And besides, Cora and Mary want to see something of New York.
Well, that's no affair of mine!
I am not a guide to Chinatown and the Bowery.
Oh Mr. Day,
I just love your house!
I could live here forever!
Cora is for you, Mrs. Day.
Oh yes. I'll run right up.
I'm glad you like our house,
Miss Skinner.
I like it very much,
Mr. Day.
Praise from a stranger is approbation indeed.
At home, our living room is green.
I like green.
I like green too.
Red's my favorite color.
It's an interesting thing about colors.
Reds a nice color in a house too.
But outside too much red would be bad.
I mean, for instance, if all the trees and the grass were red.
Outside, green's the best color.
That's right. I never thought of it that way.
But when you do think of it, it's quite a thought.
I bet you'll make your mark at Yale.
Oh...
My mother wants me to go to college.
Do you believe in girls going to college?
I guess it's all right, if they want to waste that much time, before they get married,
I mean.
I'm glad your fond of music,
Mr. Day.
Oh hello!
Look! A new Youth's Companion!
John enjoys the Youth's Companion.
John!
Won't you sit down?
Oh, thank you.
It tells all about connecting batteries in series.
John!
Miss Skinner and I were talking.
Oh, that's all right.
You won't bother me.
Jiminee!
There's where I made my mistake!
I didn't mix enough...
SSSHHH! [piano playing]
Oh, don't stop.
Can you play that?
I'm afraid not.
Can you play sweet Genevieve?
That's my favorite.
Not without my music.
Hymns are nice, don't you think?
I like this one.
[plays hymn ♪ ]
[playing fades and stops]
That's funny.
The words are the same, but it's the wrong tune.
Oh, it can't be the wrong tune.
We sing it exactly that way in church.
We don't sing it that way the Methodist Church.
You see, we're Methodists.
Oh, that's too bad.
Oh, I don't mean it's too bad that you're a Methodist.
Anybody's got a right to be anything they want.
But what I mean is, we're Episcopalians.
Yes, I know.
Anyway, the words are the same.
Shall we begin?
Now.
[both begin playing ♪ ]
[violin off key...]
Oh dear.
What's wrong?
Shall we try again?
[both begin playing ♪ ]
[violin off key...]
It must be my fault.
Oh no, it's my fault.
No, you're the Episcopalian.
I just remembered something!
My father was an Episcopalian!
He was baptized an Episcopalian!
He was an Episcopalian right up to the time he married my mother.
She was the Methodist.
Oh...
Oh, well let's try it again then!
[begin playing again ♪ ]
Well Clarence, if you're going to Delmonico's with us, you'd better get dressed.
Am I going too?
Jiminee!
Thank you, Father.
Be ready in just a minute, Mother.
Vinnie, that young lady looks about the same age you were when I came out to Pleasantville to rescue you.
Rescue me?
Ummm.
You came out there to talk me into marrying you.
Well, It worked out just the same.
[conversing in French]
French.
Oui.
There's no cooking like the French.
Clare, it was so nice of you to invite
Cora and Mary here their first night.
Well, it's been a pleasure.
Mr. Day, have you always been an Episcopalian?
I've always gone to
Episcopal Church, yes.
But you weren't baptized a Methodist or anything, were you?
You were baptized an Episcopalian?
Come to think of it,
I don't believe I was ever baptized at all.
Clare, that's not very funny, joking about a subject like that.
I'm not joking.
I remember now.
I never was baptized.
Clare, that's ridiculous.
Everybody's baptized.
Well, I'm not.
No one would keep a little baby from being baptized.
Well, you know Father and Mother, free thinkers, both of them.
They thought the children should decide those things for themselves.
But Clare...
I remember when I was ten or twelve years old,
Mother said I ought to give some thought to it, but I never got around to having it done to me.
Clare! Do you know what you're saying?
Yes, I'm saying I've never been baptized.
Then something's got to be done about it, right away.
Now Vinnie, don't get excited over nothing.
Why haven't you ever told me?
Well what difference does it make?
I've never heard of anyone who wasn't baptized, even the savages in darkest Africa!
Well, it's alright for savages and children.
But if an oversight was made in my case, it's too late to correct it now!
[sudden clap of thunder]
Well, if you're not baptized, you're not a Christian!
Why, confound it!
Of course I'm a Christian!
A mighty good Christian too!
A lot better Christian than those psalm-singers in church.
But you can't be if you won't be baptized!
I won't be baptized and I will be a Christian.
I'll be a Christian in my own way!
[sudden clap of thunder]
Clare, don't you want to meet us all in heaven?
Of course, and I'm going to!
But you can't go to heaven if you're not baptized!
Oh, that's a lot of falderol!
Clarence Day!
Don't you blaspheme like that!
You're coming to church with me before you go to the office in the morning and be baptized then and there!
Vinnie, don't be ridiculous!
If you think I'm going to stand there and let Dr. Lloyd splash water on me at my age, you are mistaken!
Now I'm sleepy.
Good night, Vinnie.
[sudden clap of thunder]
Mother, what is falderol?
Get back to sleep.
Mother?
Yes, Whitney?
If Father hasn't been baptized, he hasn't any name!
In the sight of the church, he hasn't any name.
That's right!
Maybe we're not even married!
Oohhhh!
We, thine unworthy servants, do give thee most humble and hearty thanks for all thy goodness and loving kindness to us and to all men.
We bless thee for our creation, preservation, and all the blessings of this life.
But above all, for thine inestimable love in the redemption of the world by our
Lord, Jesus Christ, for the means of grace, for the hope of glory, and we beseech thee, give us that new sense of all thy mercies, that our hearts may be...
[long prayer contines...]
Harlan, tell Clarence to kneel.
Whitney, tell Clarence to kneel.
John, tell Clarence to kneel.
Mother says, kneel.
I can't.
He says he can't.
He says he can't.
He says he can't.
[long prayer finally ends]
Amen.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the Fellowship of the Holy Ghost be with us all evermore.
Amen.
And so, my friends, what comfort and security it gives us when we have reached the age of understanding to know that the rite of baptism has not been neglected in our infancy or youth.
Can you imagine any man who has reached maturity with the knowledge that he had never been baptized failing to hasten to the holy font that his soul might be saved?
As it says in the baptismal office,
"Except a man be born of water and of the spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God."
"He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, but he that believeth not shall be damned."
What's that fellow up to?
He can't be...
Which also shows us the great benefit we reap...
[loud sermon continues...]
Tell Father, Shhh!
Tell Father, Shhh!
Tell Father, Shhh!
Tell Father, Shhh!
Mother says, Shhh!
[loud sermon continues...]
"For the promise is to you and to your children.
Doubt ye not therefore, but earnestly believe."
In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.
Amen.
This is William Tyler Wickersham.
And this is
Wilhemina Eugenia Wickersham.
What a lovely day for them to be baptized.
The happiest day in my life.
Lovely sermon.
Thank you, Mrs. Day.
Clare, you know I didn't ask Dr. Lloyd to do that.
You must have said something.
Well, I had to find out from him if we were really married.
I am married and
I'm not baptized.
And as far as I'm concerned, the whole congregation can know it.
They certainly know it now.
That suits me.
I don't go to church to be preached at as though I were some lost sheep.
Clare, you don't seem to understand what the church is for.
Vinnie, if there's one place the church should leave alone, it's a man's soul!
Well, he's going to be baptized,
Cora, you mark my word!
I just couldn't go to heaven without Clare.
Why, I get lonesome for him even when I go to Ohio!
It's awfully hard on a woman to love a man like Clare so much.
Oh, men are so aggravating.
They take everything for granted.
They certainly do!
You know, I don't believe
Clare's come right out and told me he loves me since we've been married.
Of course, I know he does because
I keep reminding him of it.
You have to keep reminding them, Cora.
Vinnie, the table isn't set for dinner yet.
I'll be back in a minute, Cora.
We're having it after Cora and Mary go to the train.
Their cab is coming at 1:00.
Cab? The horse cars go right past the door.
But Clare, they have those heavy bags.
Cabs are a waste of money.
Well, if dinner is going to be delayed,
I'll work on this month's bills.
Where are they?
Now Clare, it isn't fair to go over the household accounts when you're hungry.
Vinnie, where are those bills?
They're in the library on your desk.
I didn't know dinner was going to be late.
Nobody ever tells me anything in this house.
Back home I ride all the time.
I love horses.
The horse is my favorite animal.
Oh my goodness.
Where have you two been?
Clarence wanted to show me his his grandfather's house.
You will have to hurry and finish your packing.
It won't take me long.
Can I help you pack?
Clarence!
Clarence, why didn't you kneel in church today?
I...
I just couldn't.
If it's because your father doesn't kneel, you must remember he wasn't brought up to kneel in church.
But you were.
Has it anything to do with Mary?
I know she's a Methodist.
Oh no, Mother. Methodists kneel.
Mary told me.
They don't get up-and-down so much, but they stay down longer.
Clarence, you want to kneel, don't you?
Oh yes!
I wanted to kneel today.
I tried! You saw me try!
But... I just couldn't.
Is that suit of your father's too tight for you?
No, it's not too tight.
What is it?
Mother, very peculiar things have happened to me since
I started to wear this suit.
I can't seem to make these clothes do anything Father wouldn't do!
That's nonsense, Clarence.
And not to kneel in church is a sacrilege.
Making Father's trousers kneel seemed more of a sacrilege.
Clarence!
Do you know what happened at Dura Wakefield's party for Mary last night?
We were playing musical chairs and some girl sat down suddenly right in my lap.
Well I jumped up so fast she almost got hurt!
She was sitting on Father's trousers!
Well Mother, I've got to have a suit of my own!
My soul and body! Well you'll just have to talk to your father about it.
I'm sure if you approach him the right way, you know, tactfully, he'll see.
Oh excuse me.
Gracious! It didn't take you very long.
Well I'll see about your box lunch for the train.
Remember, it's Sunday.
I... I was hoping we could have a few minutes together before you left.
Cora had so much to do,
I wanted to get out of her way.
Well, didn't you want to see me?
I did want to tell you how much
I've enjoyed our... friendship.
Oh hello. Mother told us to sit in the living room till dinner's ready.
Not on the best sofa! Hello.
Hello.
Have you ever been out on our porch?
Oh yes.
Well let me show it to you!
It's awfully hard to grow up in a family with children.
My, I've never known a week to pass so quickly.
Why I...
Yes?
Why I...
Yes?
You're going to write me when you when you get to Springfield, aren't you?
Of course, if you write me first.
But you'll have something to write about, your trip and aunt Judith and how things are in Springfield.
You write me as soon as you get there.
Maybe I'll be too busy.
Maybe I won't have time.
Well, you find the time!
Let's not have any nonsense about that!
You'll write me first, and you'll do it right away, the first day.
How do you know I'll take orders from you?
Well I'll show you!
Give me your hand!
Why should I?
Give me your hand, confound it!
Why do you want... my hand?
I just wanted it.
[sighs]
What are you thinking about?
I was just thinking.
About what?
I was hoping you'd write me first because that would mean you liked me.
What's my writing first got to do with liking you?
You do like me then?
Of course I do.
I like you better than any girl I ever met!
But you don't like me well enough to write first?
Well I don't see how one thing's got anything to do with the other!
But a girl can't write first because... because she's a girl!
Well that's nonsense! if a girl has something to write about and a fellow hasn't, there's no reason why she shouldn't write first.
You know, the first three days I was here, you'd do anything for me!
And then you changed!
You used to be a lot of fun.
Then all of a sudden, you turned into an old sobersides.
Why... why you even dress like an old sobersides!
What's the matter?
I just happened to remember something.
What?
Oh, I know.
It's because this is the last time we'll be together.
Mary! Please!
But Clarence, we'll see each other in a month when I come back.
Oh Clarence, please write me first because that will show me how much you like me.
Pleeeeeease?
I'll show you how much I like you...
Get up! Get up!
Ohhhh! Ohhhh!
Oh Mary, don't do that
Please, don't do that!
Now you will think i'm just a bold and forward girl!
Oh no!
No, it's not that!
Was it because it's Sunday?
No, it'd be the same any day.
Oh! You just didn't want me sitting on your lap!
Oh, it was nice of you to do it!
It was nice of me?
So you told me to get up!
You just couldnt bear to have me sit there!
Oh and you needn't write me first!
You neeedn't write me any letters at at all!
Because I will tear them up without opening them!
I never want to see you again!
Oh Mary! Mary, listen to me!
Mary! Please! Oh Mary...
[shreiking}
Ohhhhhh!
Clarence!
Yes Father?
That young lady's crying!
She's in tears.
What's the meaning of this?
I'm sorry, Father.
It's all my fault.
Nonsense!
What's that girl trying to do to you?
No no... she wasn't...
It was... I... I...
Well! Whatever the quarrel was about, Clarence,
I'm glad you held your own!
Father, I have to have a new suit of clothes!
You've got to give me the money for it!
Young man! Do you realize that you're addressing your father?
I'm sorry, Father.
I apologize.
But you don't know how important this is to me.
A new suit of clothes clothes is so impor...
Oh why should...
Clarence has your need for a new suit of clothes anything to do with that young lady?
Yes Father.
Why, Clarence!
Why, this comes as quite a shock to me!
What does, Father?
Well, you're being so... grown-up!
Still, I might have known, if you are going to college this fall...
Yes, you're at the age when you'll be meeting girls.
Clarence, there are things about women that I think you ought to know.
Sit down.
Yes, I think it's better for you to hear this from me than to have to learn it for yourself.
Clarence, women aren't the angels that you think they are.
Well now, first let me explain this to you.
You see, Clarence, we men have to run this world.
And it's not an easy job.
It takes work and it takes thinking.
A man has to reason things out.
Now you take a woman.
A woman thinks...
No, I'm wrong right there!
A woman doesn't think at all!
She gets stirred up!
And she gets stirred up over the most confounded things!
Now I love my wife just as much as any man.
But that doesn't mean that I should stand for a lot of falderol!
By God, I won't stand for it!
Stand for what, Father?
That's the one thing I shall not submit myself to!
Clarence, if a man thinks a certain thing is wrong, he shouldn't do it!
If he thinks it's right, he should do it!
Now, that has nothing to do with whether he loves his wife or not!
Who says it has, Father?
They do!
Who, sir?
Women!
They get stirred up and then they try to get you stirred up too!
But don't you let them do it, Clarence!
Don't you let them do it!
Now, if you can keep reason and logic in the argument, well, a man can hold his own, of course.
But if they can switch you, pretty soon the argument's about whether you love them or not!
I swear, I don't know how they do it, but don't you let them, Clarence.
Don't you let them!
I see what you mean so far, Father.
If you don't watch yourself, love can make you do a lot of things you don't want to do.
Exactly!
But if you do watch out and know just how to handle women...
Then you'll be all right!
All a man has to do is be firm!
You know how sometimes I have to be firm with your mother.
Yes. But Father, what can you do when they cry?
Hmmm, well ahh... that's quite a question.
You just have to make them understand that what you're doing is for their good.
I see.
Now, Clarence, you know all about women.
But Father...
Yes Clarence?
I thought you were going to tell me about...
About what?
About women!
Clarence, there are some things gentlemen don't discuss!
I've told you all you need to know.
The thing for you to remember is: be firm.
Mary, when you get to Springfield, the very first thing you...
Oh God!
What's the matter, Clare?
What's wrong?
Sit down, Vinnie.
Oh Clare, Cora and Mary are leaving any moment now...
Sit down.
Vinnie, you know
I like to live well, and I want my family to live well.
But this house must be run on a business basis!
I must know how much money
I'm spending and what for!
For instance, if you recall, a week ago I gave you $6.00 to buy a new coffee pot.
Yes, because you broke the old one!
You threw it right on the floor!
I'm not talking about that.
Now I find here among my...
It was a pity to break that nice coffee pot,
Clare, it was imported from France. and that little shop has stopped selling them.
But what has that...
They said the tariff wouldn't let them.
And that's your fault because you're always voting to raise the tariff.
The tariff protects America against cheap foreign labor.
Now this bill...
The tariff does nothing but put up the prices and that's hard on everybody especially the farmer.
Vinnie, I wish to heaven you wouldn't talk about matters you don't know anything about!
I do too know about them!
Miss Guelig says that every intelligent woman should have some opinion about...
Who may I ask is Miss Guelig?
She's the current events woman.
I told you about.
And the tickets are $1 every Tuesday.
Do you mean to tell me that a pack of idle minded females pay $1 apiece to hear another female gavel about the events of the day!?
Listen to me if you want to know anything about the events of the day!
But do you get so excited, Clare!
And besides, Miss Guelig says that our president, whom you're always belittling, prays to God for guidance.
Vinnie, what happened to that $6.00?
What $6.00?
I gave you $6.00 to buy a new coffee pot.
Now I find that you apparently got one at Lewis and Congers and charged it!
Here's their bill.
One coffee pot - $5.00.
So you owe me a dollar!
And you can hand it right over!
I'll do nothing of the kind!
What did you do with that $6.00?
Well Clare, I can't tell you now, dear.
Why didn't you ask me at the time?
I give up!
Wait a minute!
I spent $4.50 for that new umbrella.
Now we're getting somewhere!
One umbrella - $4.50.
And that must have been in the week
I paid Mrs. Tobin for two extra days washing.
Mrs. Tobin...
Tthat's $2 more. that makes... that makes up... $6.50.
And that's another 50¢ you owe me!
I don't owe you anything!
What you owe me is an explanation of where my money is gone!
I do the best I can to keep down expenses.
You know yourself, Cousin Phoebe spends twice as much as we do.
Don't talk to me about your cousin Phoebe!
You talk about your own relatives enough!
That's not fair, Vinnie.
When I talk about my relatives,
I criticize them!
I can't even speak of Cousin Phoebe!
You can speak of her all you want to.
But I won't have Cousin Phoebe or anyone else dictating to me how to run my house!
I didn't say a word about her dictating.
Clare, you know she isn't that...
You said... You said...
I don't know what you said now!
You never stick to the point!
Now, we're going over this account book - item by item.
I find here a bill for $38.
I don't know what you expect of me.
I tire myself out chasing up and down those stairs all day long, trying to look after your comfort, to bring up our children...
I do the mending and the marketing.
Now you want me to be an expert book keeper too!
Vinnie, I want to be reasonable. But...
Can't you understand?
I'm doing all this for your own good.
Well, I suppose I'll have to go ahead just paying the bills and hoping I've got enough money in the bank to meet them.
But it's all very discouraging.
I'll try to do better, Clare.
Well, that's all I'm asking.
Well, I'll it make out the checks and sign them.
But... maybe I haven't any right to sign those checks since in the sight of the Lord
I haven't any name!
That's right! Clare, to make those checks good, you'll have to be baptized... right away.
Vinnie, the bank doesn't care whether
I've been baptized or not.
Well, I care!
And no matter what Dr. Lloyd said,
I'm not sure we're really married.
Vinnie, we have four children!
If we're not married now, we never will be!
Clare, Dr. Lloyd said this morning...
Ahh, that's all, Vinnie.
Uhh, I think you better go tell
Whitney to watch for the cab.
Not before you give me that $1.50.
What $1.50?
That $1.50 you owe me!
I don't owe you any $1.50!
I gave you money to buy a coffee pot for me, and somehow it turned into an umbrella for you!
Why, Clarence Day! What kind of man are you?
Quibbling about $1.50 when your immortal soul is in danger!
And what's more...
All right! All right! All right!
Thank you, Clare.
Now the accounts are all straight again!
What were you doing down there?
I'm setting up this new burglar alarm.
I invented it myself.
Have you got any money you can lend me?
No, you owe me 30¢ now.
Well, I'll give you my stamp collection and my piece of
John Wilkes Booth's finger.
How much?
Enough to get a new suit of clothes.
If you can wait a month till I hear from the Patent Office in Washington,
I may be rich!
I can't wait that long!
Maybe I could get it sooner.
I'm gonna look into something else tomorow.
Wanted. An energetic young man to sell household necessity.
Liberal commission.
Apply 312... John, let me have this job!
Why should I give you my job?
They're hard to get!
I've got to get a new suit of clothes.
Maybe I could get the job for both of us.
I'll ask the man.
The cab's here, Father.
Oh, thank you, Whitney.
Vinnie! Corra!
The cab's here!
Uhh, John, go up and get their bags.
Yes sir.
Here's the lunch for the train, sir.
Well, take it out to the cab.
Who's that one?
It's Ellen. Delia left yesterday.
I don't know where your mother finds them.
Now Vinnie, don't you let Clare worry about us.
We have plenty of time.
Ah, take the bags right on out, John.
Yes sir.
Well goodbye, Clarence.
It was so nice to see you.
Goodbye, Cousin Cora.
Goodbye, Whitney.
Now you be a good boy.
Goodbye, Cousin Cora.
Goodbye, Harlan.
Goodbye. Keep out of mischief.
Come along, everybody.
Don't keep the cab waiting.
Cabs cost money.
If there's one thing Mr. Day can't stand, it's to keep a cab waiting.
If there's any waiting to do, there's a waiting room at the
Grand Central Depot just for that.
Mary, aren't you even going to shake hands with me?
I don't think I'd better.
You may remember, that when I get too close to you, you feel contaminated.
Mary, you're going to write to me, aren't you?
Are you going to write first?
No, Mary.
There are times when a man must be firm.
Mary, Mother says you better hurry out before Father starts yelling.
It's Sunday.
Goodbye, John.
I'm very happy to have made
YOUR acquaintance.
Thank you!
May I help you?
No, thank you.
Take care of yourself.
Goodbye, Mr. Day.
Goodbye, Mary.
I've had a wonderful time.
Bye bye.
Goodbye, Cousin Clare.
Goodbye, Cora.
Dear Mary...
My duty toward my neighbor is to love him as myself and to do to all men as I would they should do unto me.
Has Father gone to the office yet?
Come on, let's go to the ball field.
I've got to guard this box till John comes back.
It's his burglar alarm.
It wouldn't work, so he fixed it.
We're going to put it back in the dining room after Father goes to the office.
Are there burglars around?
Everywhere!
Oh...
...to love, honor, and succor my father and my mother.
Why do you have to learn that?
Because if I don't,
I'll go to hell!
Father's going to hell!
He is not!
Yes he is, because he isn't baptized!
He'll go to hell and burn for a thousand years!
He won't! He won't!
He'll be in a lake of fire and brimstone!
And a thousand devils with pitchforks will be poking at him!
No! No! Mother dont' let...
Father will hear you!
[singing loudly:] ♪ Oh come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant. ♪
Don't smother me!
♪ Oh come, all ye faithful... ♪
What's that noise?
Just singing, Father.
You boys, be quiet! You know your mother isn't feeling well.
Yes, Father.
What did your mother say?
She says she doesn't want any breakfast.
Now, why does your mother do that to me?
She knows that it just upsets my day when she doesn't come down to breakfast.
A special delivery, sir.
Thank you.
Where's John this morning?
John had his breakfast early, Father, and went out to see about something.
See about what?
Well, John and I thought we'd work this summer and earn some money.
Good! Work never hurt anyone.
It's good for them.
But if you're going to work, work hard.
King Solomon had the right idea about work.
"Whatever thy hand findeth to do,"
Solomon said, "Do thy doggonedest!"
Hmm, well I don't understand this at all.
Here's a letter from some woman
I never even heard of!
Oh Father...
Oh God!
What is it, Father?
This woman claims that she sat on my lap and that I didn't like it!
Huh!
What's that word?
No, that one down there!
It looks like "curiosity".
Oh... "I only opened your letter as a matter of curiosity."
Huh!
Yes, go on!
Why, this gets worse and worse!
It just turns into a lot of sentimental lovey-dovey mush!
Ha! If this is someone's idea of a practical joke...
What's the matter, Clare?
What's wrong?
Nothing wrong.
Just a fool letter.
How are you feeling, Vinnie?
I thought you needed me.
If you don't,
I'll go back to bed.
On, no no no! Come sit down and get some food in you.
It'll do you good.
Build up your strength.
Here, here.
Sit down. Sit down.
Here uh... What's this one's name?
Nora.
Nora, get Mrs. Day some bacon and eggs.
No, Nora. Bring me a cup of tea up to my room.
Yes ma'am.
Oh Vinnie, it's just weak to give in to an ailment!
I notice when you have a headache, you yell and groan and swearing enough.
Well, that's to prove to the headache that I am stronger than it is!
I think I've caught some kind of germ.
Some of my friends have had to send for the doctor.
A doctor!?
Oh poppycock!
But Clare dear, when people are ill, you have to do something!
Certainly you have to do something!
Cheer them up!
That's the way to cure them.
How would you go about cheering them up?
I? Well I'd tell them "Bah!"
[Vinnie crying...]
Well, what have I done now?
Oh... Oh Clare, hush up!
Vinnie, I didn't mean to upset you.
"Dear Clarence..."
I... I was just trying to help you.
You know, when you take your bed,
I have a confounded lonely time around here.
So when I see you getting into your head that you're not feeling well,
I want to do something about it.
Just because some of your friends have given into this, is no reason why you should imagine you're ill.
Clare, stop! Get out of this house and go to your office.
Did you get the job?
Yes, for both of us!
Look, I've got with me!
What is it?
Medicine!
Medicine? You took a job for us to go out and sell medicine?
But it's wonderful medicine.
Look what it cures...
"A sovereign cure for colds, coughs, catarrh, asthma, quinsy, and sore throat, poor digestion, summer complaint, colic, dyspepsia, heartburn, and shortness of breath, lumbago, rheumatism, heart disease, giddiness, and women's complaints, nervous prostration, St. Vitus dance, jaundice, la grippe, proud flesh, pink eye, sea sickness, and pimples."
It's made from a secret formula known only to Dr. Bartlett.
We get 25¢ cents commission on every bottle we sell!
And he's giving us the territory of all Manhattan Island!
Well, lots of Father's and Mother's friends have some of those diseases.
Let's start out by calling on them.
Yes. Oh... What if they ask us if we use it at our house?
Oh yes, it would be better if we could say we did.
Excuse me.
Oh, is that the tea for Mrs. Day?
Yes.
Oh, I'll take it up to her.
Thank you.
Right away now, while it's hot.
What's the matter with Mother?
I don't know.
She was just complaining.
Say! It says here it's good for women's complaints! Here...
Yes sir, Chesapeake and Ohio: an eighth.
New York Central: three quarters.
I'd like to see Mr. Day about those
Morris and Essex deposits.
He's very busy this morning.
You'll have to wait.
Where's Father?
Well, Master Whitney, have you come to pay us a visit?
Where's Father?
He's busy in his office with a customer.
Master Whitney!
Mr. Day, the president of the firm is...
Father, you have to come home right away!
What's the meaning of this?
Who sent you down here?
Your mother?
No sir. Mother's ill.
She's terribly ill.
Did the doctor sent you for me?
No sir. It was Margaret.
Margaret?
Margaret says you're to come home right away, and no nonsense!
Perkins, go down and stop the first cab you see.
A cab, sir??
For you, Mr. Day??
Yes, I want a cab and no nonsense!
I'm sorry, Mr. Hopkins.
Confound you!
Can't you go any faster?
All right, sir.
Gid-up!
Gid-up there!
You hear me! Gid-up!
Oh doctor. How is Mrs. Day?
She's a pretty sick woman.
Well what's wrong with her?
Well, do you know?
Or don't you?
What did Mrs. Day have for breakfast this morning?
Not a thing! I tried to get her to eat something, but she wouldn't.
I can't understand it.
Understand what?
These violent attacks of nausea.
It's almost as though she were poisoned.
Poisoned?
Let me take your cab.
I'll try not to be gone more than 10 to 15 minutes.
And Mr. Day you are not to go into her room!
You'd better get her well!
Right away! Or you'll hear from me!
Turn west on 27th Street.
Gid-up. Gid-up.
How is Mother?
I don't know?
Well she better be good and sick or Father may be mad at me for getting him up here.
Especially in a cab.
Has your father come?
Yes, just now!
Where are you going, Margaret?
I have to go for the minister.
I guess the minister's coming to baptize
Father so he won't have to go to hell.
He can't be baptized in a house.
You've got to have water.
We have lots of water!
Not the right kind.
Is Mother better, Father?
How can I tell?
She wouldn't let me in the room with her.
These confounded doctors never know what's the matter with anybody!
Father?
Yes?
Mother's going to get well, isn't she?
Of course she's going to get well.
Father, may we come in?
It's lonesome without Mother.
Yes, it is, Harlan.
It's lonesome. Come in, boys.
What have you been doing, Harlan?
Nothing, they won't let me upstairs.
What about you, Whitney?
I was supposed to learn the rest of my catechism.
Will you hear me, Father?
Yes Whitney,
I'll hear you.
Start here.
"How many parts are there in a sacrament?"
Two: the outward visible sign and the inward spiritual grace.
"What is the outward visible sign or form in bap... baptism?"
Water, wherein the person is baptized in the name of...
You haven't been baptized, have you, Father?
Whitney, what is the outward visible sign?
Water, wherein the person... wherein the person...
You don't know it well enough, Whitney.
You'd better go and study it some more.
Do you want me to read to you, Harlan?
Father, are they going to put you into hell?
Whitney, take Harlan with you.
What's the world coming to?
Everybody's sending for doctors.
Doctors don't do you any good.
Only make you feel worse.
All poppycock!
[bell rining]
Who's rining that bell?
Stop that noise!
Stop it, I say! What idiot's ringing that bell?
Mr. Day, we must all be quiet.
Mrs.Day's been ill.
I know she's ill.
Go up and see if she needs anything.
What are you doing out of house?
Sent for the minister.
The minister?
He'll be right in.
He's paying off the cab.
I was deeply shocked to learn the serious nature of Mrs. Day's illness.
Will you take me up to her?
She's resting now.
She can't be disturbed.
The doctor will be back in a minute.
Mrs. Day has been a tower of strength in the parish.
Everyone liked her so much.
Yes, she was a fine woman.
I wish to heaven you wouldn't talk about Mrs. Day as if she were dead!
Is the doctor back yet?
No, does she need him?
Well, she's kind of restless.
She's talking in her sleep and twisting and turning.
[doorbell]
Well doctor, it seems to me that was a pretty long 10 minutes!
See here, Mr. Day. if I'm to handle this case...
How can you handle it if you're out of the house?
Who is this?
It's Dr. Somers.
How do you do?
I felt that Mrs. Day's condition warranted my getting Dr. Somers here as soon as possible for consultation.
I hope that meets with your approval?
Why yes, of course.
Anything that can be done.
Upstairs, doctor.
Pardon me.
Mrs. Day is in good hands now, Mr. Day.
There's nothing you and I can do at the moment to help.
Dr. Lloyd?
Yes?
There's something that's troubling Mrs. Day's mind.
Oh?
I think you know what I refer to.
Yes. You mean the fact that you've never been baptized.
Yes, I gathered that you knew about it from your sermon last Sunday.
But let's not get angry.
I think something had better be done about it.
Yes, Mr. Day?
When the doctors get through up there,
I want you to talk to Mrs. Day.
I want you to tell her something.
Well, I'd be glad to!
You're just the man to do it.
She shouldn't be upset about this.
Now I want you to tell her that my being baptized would just be a lot of confounded nonsense.
But Mr. Day...
Oh, she'll take your word on a thing like that.
And we both must do everything we can to help her now.
But the solution is so simple.
It would take only your consent to be baptized.
That's out of the question!
And I'm surprised that a grown man like you would suggest such a thing!
Well doctor, how is she?
What have you decided?
Is there a room we could use for our consultation?
Oh yes, my library.
Doctor...
Dr. Somers, this isn't serious is it?
After we've had our consultation, we'll talk to you, Mr. Day.
But surely...
Rest assured,
Dr. Somers will do everything that is humanly possible.
We'll try not to be long.
Tell me, this Dr. -uh- Somers, he's very highly thought of, isn't he?
Oh yes.
But if Vinnie is seriously...
If anyone could help her, he could.
Don't you think?
Very fine physician.
But there is a greater help, ever-present in the hour of need.
Let us turn to him, in prayer.
Let us kneel and pray.
Let us kneel and pray.
Oh Lord, look down from heaven.
Behold, visit, and relieve this thy servant who is grieved with sickness.
Have mercy on her, oh Lord.
Have mercy on this miserable sinner.
Forgive her, and extend thy accustomed...
She's not a miserable sinner, and you know it!
Oh God! You know Vinnie is not a miserable sinner!
She's a fine woman!
She shouldn't be made to suffer!
It's got to stop, I tell you!
It's got to stop!
Have mercy, I say!
Have mercy, I tell you!
What's the matter, Clare?
What's wrong?
Vinnie! Vinnie, what are you doing down here?
You shouldn't be out of bed!
You get right back upstairs!
I heard you call.
Do you need me?
Vinnie, I know now how much I need you.
Get well, Vinnie. I'll be baptized.
I promise. I'll be baptized.
You will?
I'll do anything.
Oh Clare!
We'll go to Europe, just we two.
You won't have to worry about the children or the household accounts or... Vinnie!
Don't worry, Mr. Day.
She'll be all right now.
Bless you for what you've done!
What did I do?
You promised to be baptized.
I did?!
Oh God!
Isn't it drafty here, Mother?
Shall I get your coat, Mother?
No thank you.
I'm quite comfortable, thank you.
Come on now. Let's stay together.
Harlan, don't you get lost again.
Aren't the hats lovely this year?
Ostrich feathers!
You wouldn't wear that hat, would you, Mother?
Well, I think that's very pretty.
I think they're all pretty.
Well, I do need some pink silk thread.
Oh, isn't this applique beautiful?
Just arrived from Paris, madam.
It's charming.
What are you looking for, Mother?
Oh, I'm just shopping.
I think I just take a plain one.
But this is the very latest.
We've only had them in a few days.
Remember, Mother, this is your first day out.
You mustn't get too tired.
No, I'm saving myself, dear.
I have to.
Cousin Cora's coming tomorrow.
She is?
Does Father know about it?
Not yet.
Is Mary coming too?
Yes, dear.
Harlan, don't touch things.
I'll bet you knew it.
No, honest I didn't, not tomorrow.
Aren't the sleeves a little long?
It fits right across the shoulders.
Now, about the sleeves...
Do we have any more of this material?
Yes, we do. Thank you.
This one is genuine imitation Dresden, the original design by Duriet.
John, isn't this the darlingest thing?
It's exactly what
I've always wanted.
How much is this lovely pug dog?
$15, ma'am.
$15! Gee whiz, Mother.
We could buy a real live bloodhound for $5.
Oh, isn't he perfectly adorable?
Oh, I shouldn't.
I know I shouldn't.
Mrs. Day!
Oh, Mrs. Whitehead.
How nice to see you.
Are you quite recovered?
Almost.
This is my first day out.
We've missed you at the church.
You remember Mr. Morley.
How do you do, Mrs. Day?
How do you do?
Mr. Morley preached the
Sunday Dr. Lloyd was ill.
Oh yes! I can't tell you how much I enjoyed your sermon.
Even my husband enjoyed your sermon.
We've just come from the board meeting of the foreign missions.
I'm taking Mr. Morley home to lunch.
I had to drop in here to pick up a purchase. I won't be a minute.
Is your parish in the city?
Yes, it's on the outskirts.
My church is in Audubon Park.
Oh, way up there.
Oh, are you acquainted in Audubon Park?
No, I don't believe we know a soul there.
Mr. Morley, would this be possible?
My husband, Mr. Day...
If we lower the collar, it'll be a very fine fit.
You won't find a better suit of clothes in the city for $15.
Oh, it's not the price.
It's the money.
Thank you for holding it for me.
You're welcome.
Goodbye, Mrs. Day.
I hope we meet again soon.
Goodbye. It was very pleasant meeting you again.
I think it was divine providence.
I shall be delighted to be of service.
Goodbye, Mr. Morley.
Goodbye.
May I work it?
Oh no. It's against the rules.
Whee...
Hello.
What did you bring home more medicine for?
Dr. Bartlett paid us off, didn't he?
Oh yes.
Oh jiminy, you scared me.
I've got to take $15 right down to McCreery's.
I bought a suit there this morning and
I said I'd have the money this afternoon.
Gee, that's too bad.
What's too bad?
Well...
Well, you see, Clarence...
What?
Dr. Bartlett paid us off in medicine.
Oh god!
Well, he thanked us too for our services to mankind.
But my suit!
I've got to have it tomorrow!
And besides, they're making the alterations.
I've got to have $15!
Maybe you could offer them
15 bottles of medicine.
Oh, they wouldn't take it.
McCreery's don't sell medicine!
Father!
Vinnie!
I'm home!
Good afternoon, sir.
How's your mother, Clarence?
Oh, the ride this morning did her a lot of good.
She'll be well enough to go to church with us next Sunday.
Ah, fine!
Father, have you noticed I haven't been kneeling down in church lately?
Don't let your mother catch you at it.
Then, I have to have a new suit of clothes right away.
That doesn't make sense.
I can't do anything in your clothes that you wouldn't do!
Well, if my old clothes make you behave yourself,
I don't think you ought to wear anything else!
Oh no! You're you, and I'm me!
I'm want to be myself!
I mean, suppose I should want to kneel down in front of a girl.
Why in heaven's name should you want to do a thing like that?
Well, I've got to propose to a girl sometime.
Clarence!
Oh, not right away.
But for $15, I can get a good suit of clothes.
Clarence, you're beginning to talk as crazy as your mo...
...Hello, Vinnie.
You're feeling better today, huh?
Much better.
Thank you, Clare.
You don't have to hurry home from the office every day like this.
Uh, with business the way it is, there's no use going to the office at all.
Yes, you do look better, Vinnie.
What did you do today?
Well, I got a carriage and took the boys for a ride.
And we stopped in at McCreery's.
And, oh Clare, I have the most wonderful news for you.
Who do you think I met?
Mr. Morley.
Morley?
Never heard of him?
Remember, that nice young minister who substituted for Dr. Lloyd one Sunday.
Oh yes.
Bright young fellow.
Preached a good sensible sermon, short one too.
Ought to be more ministers like him.
Well Clare, his parish is in Audubon Park.
You know, way up above Harlem.
Nobody knows you up there.
You'll be perfectly safe.
Safe? Vinnie, what the devil are you talking about?
I've gone all over everything with Mr. Morley.
And he's agreed to baptize you.
Oh, he has!
Hehe, the young whippersnapper!
Very nice of him.
We can go up there any morning.
We don't even have to make an appointment.
Who said I was going to be baptized at all?
Why Clare! You did!
Now Vinnie...
You gave me your promise, your sacred promise!
You said: I'll be baptized.
I promise I'll be baptized.
Well, what if I did?
Clare! Aren't you a man of your word?
Vinnie, we all thought you were dying!
So naturally, I said that to cheer you up!
As a matter of fact, the doctor told me that's what cured you!
So it seems to me pretty ungrateful of you to press this matter any further.
My being well has nothing to do with it.
You gave me your word!
You gave the Lord your word!
And you're going to march yourself up to Mr. Morley's church some morning before you go to the office and be christened!
If you think for one minute I'm...
What in the name of heaven is that?
If you think I'm going to let you add the sin of breaking your solemn and sacred promise...
I demand to know what that repulsive object is?
It's perfectly plain what it is.
It's a pug dog.
What is it going in this house?
I wanted it and I bought it.
You spent good money for that?
Clare don't try to change the subject.
How much did you pay for that atrocity?
I didn't pay anything for it.
I charged it.
Charged it!
I might have known!
How much was it?
For that eyesore?
Don't you call this lovely work of art an eyesore!
It will look beautiful sitting on a red cushion by the fireplace in the living room.
If that sits in the living room,
I won't!
Furthermore, I don't even want it in the same house with me!
Get it out of here!
Clare, you're not going to get out of this room until you set a date for your baptism!
I'll tell you one thing.
I'll never be baptized as long as that hideous monstrosity is in this house!
All right!
All right!
Clarence...
That pug dog goes back this afternoon and he's chrisrened first in the morning!
You heard him, didn't you, Clarence?
You heard him say that he'd be baptized as soon as I got this pug dog out of the house.
You hurry right back to McCreery's with it and be sure they credit us with $15.
Oh Mother, while we were at McCreery's,
I happened to see a suit
I'd like very much.
And the suit was only $15.
Well Clarence, I'm afraid your suit will have to wait until after I get your father christened.
Well no, I meant that since the suit cost just the same as the pug dog,
If I exchanged the pug dog for the suit...
Why yes! Then the suit wouldn't cost your father anything!
Why, how bright of you, Clarence, to think of that!
I'd better start right away before McCreery's closes.
Yes.
Now let's see.
If we're going to take your father all the way to Audubon Park...
Clarence, on your way back, you stop at the livery stable and tell them to have a cab here at 8 o'clock tomorrow morning.
Mother! A cab!
Do you think you ought to?
We can't walk all the way to Audubon Park!
But you know what a cab does to Father.
This is a very important occasion.
All right.
Get one of their best cabs, the kind they use at funerals.
But those cost $2 an hour!
And if Father gets mad...
Well, if your father starts to argue in the morning, you remember...
Oh he agreed to it.
We both heard him.
I hope you notice,
Clarence is returning the pug dog.
Well, that's a sign you're getting your faculties back!
Don't dawdle, Clarence.

Vinnie, it's good to hear you singing again.

Makes my happiness complete ♪
♪ Makes me falter at your feet,
Sweet Marie ♪
Oh, uh - on the way uptown,
I stopped in at
Tiffany's and bought you a little something.
Thought you might like it.
Clare!
What a beautiful ring!
Well, I'm glad it pleases you.
Oh Clare!
How sweet of you!
I don't know how to thank you!
Well, it's thanks enough for me just to have you up and around again.
You know when you're ill, Vinnie, this house is like a tomb!
There's no excitement.
That's the loveliest ring you ever bought me.
Now that I have this, you needn't buy me any more rings.
Well, if you don't want any more.
What I'd really like now is a nice diamond necklace.
Vinnie, do you know how much a diamond necklace costs?
Yes, I know, Clare.
But don't you see, your getting me this shows I mean a little something to you.
Now a diamond necklace...
Good heaven!
If you don't know by this time how I feel about you...
Well we've been married for 20 years!
And I've loved you every minute of it!
What did you say, Clare?
I said we've been married for 20 years and I've loved you every minute of it.
But if I have to buy out jewelry stores to prove it...
If I haven't shown it to you in my words and actions...
Well, I might as well...
Well, what have I done now?
It's all right, Clare.
I'm just so happy.
Happy?
You said you loved me.
And this beautiful ring, that's something else I didn't expect.
Oh Clare.
I love surprises.
That's another thing I've never understood about you, Vinnie.
Now I like to know what to expect,
Then I'm prepared to meet it.
Yes, I know, Clare.
But life would be pretty dull if we always knew what was coming.
Well, it's certainly not dull around here!
In this house, you never know what's going to hit you tomorrow! Hehehe.

Well then, Harlan, the very...
Who are you?
What's your name?
Margaret, sir.
Can't be Margaret.
We've got one Margaret in the house.
At home, they call me Maggie, sir.
All right, Maggie.
If her name's Margaret, that's a good sign.
Maybe she'll stay a while.
Hehehe...
Do you know, boys, your mother used to be just the same about cooks as she is about maids.
Never could keep them for some reason.
Well, one day about...uh
14 years ago...
Yes, it was right after you were born, John.
My, you were a homely baby!
Hehehe...
Thank you, Margaret.
Good morning, boys.
Good morning, Mother.
Good morning, Clare.
Morning, Vinnie.
Why, you look as though you were dressed for a wedding.
Do I, dear?
Yes.
Have a good night?
Yes, thank you, Clare.
Sit down, Vinnie.
Sit down, boys.
Oh, thank you, Clarence.
Well, seems to me everyone's all dressed up this morning.
What's on the program for this fine day?
Well, this afternoon,
May Lewis' mother is giving a party for everyone in May's dancing class.
Harlan's going to that.
I don't want to go, Mama.
Harlan! Don't you want to go to a party and get ice cream and cake?
May Lewis always tries to kiss me! hehehe...
When you get a little older, you won't object to girls wanting to kiss you...
Will he, Clarence? hehehe
This is for you, Mr. Day.
Where shall I put it?
Oh, that's for me, I think.
Take it upstairs, Maggie.
Wait a minute, Maggie.
Bring it here. Let me see it.
See! It's for me, Father:
Clarence Day Jr.
Let me look.
Well, that's from McCreery's.
It's marked: Charge!
What is it?
Clare, it's all right.
It's nothing for you to worry about.
Well, at least I think I should know what's being charged to me.
What is it?
Clare, stop your fussing.
It's a new suit of clothes for Clarence and it isn't costing you a penny.
It's marked: Charge $15.
It's costing me $15!
And I told Clarence...
Clare, can't you take my word?
It isn't costing you a penny!
I'd like to have you explain why it isn't!
Because Clarence took the pug dog back and got the suit instead!
Of course, and they'll charge me $15 for the suit.
Nonsense, Clare.
We gave them the pug dog for the suit. Don't you see?
Then they'll charge me $15 for the pug dog.
But Clare, they can't!
We haven't got the pug dog!
We sent that back!
Well... Hmm... But...
Well now, wait a minute, Vinnie.
The suit...
Well, there's something wrong with your reasoning!
Well, Clare!
I'm surprised at you!
And you're supposed to be so good at figures!
Why, it's perfectly clear to me!
Vinnie, they're going to charge me for one thing or the other!
Don't you let them!
Haa...
Well, McCreery's aren't giving away suits, and they aren't giving away pug dogs.
Why, it should be clear to a child, that if Clarence sent the pug dog back, they... Well...
I will not have that botanical freak in this room!
John! Have you been going around this town selling medicine?
Yes, Mother.
Dog medicine?
No, Mother.
Not dog medicine.
This letter from Mrs. Sprague says you sold her a bottle of this medicine and that her little boy gave some of it to their dog and it killed him.
Now she wants $10 from us for a new dog
Here, let me see that letter.
Well, he shouldn't have given it to a dog. It's for humans.
Why, it's Bartlett's Beneficent Balm, made from a secret formula.
Have you been going around among our friends and neighbors selling  some patent nostrum?
But it's good medicine, Father.
I can prove that by Mother.
Vinnie, what do you know about this?
Well, nothing, Clare.
But I'm sure John...
No, I mean that day Mother was...
That's enough!
You're going to every house where you sold a bottle of that concoction and buy it all back!
But it's a dollar a bottle!
I don't care how much it is.
Here.
I'll give you the money now.
How many bottles did you sell?
Clare, I always told you John would make a good businessman!
Young man, you'll have to come down to my office with me.
I'll give you the money to buy back that medicine.
$128, and $10 more for Mrs. Sprague's dog.
That's $138.
Thank you, Vinnie.
But it's all coming out of your allowance!
That means that you'll not get another penny until the whole $138 is paid up!
I'll be 21 years old!
Oh God!
What the matter, Clare?
What's wrong?
Those gypsies are back!
Don't anyone answer the door!
They're moving in on us again, bag and baggage!
I won't have it, I tell you!
I won't have it!
Now Clare...
Don't let them in!
Clare, hush up.
They'll hear you.
Tell them to get back in that cab and drive right on to Ohio!
As if we could turn our own relatives away!
They're extravagant enough to take cabs when horse cars run right by our door.
Now, you be quiet and behave yourself!
John, come help with the baggage.
Why do they always have to pounce on us without any warning?
Shhhh!
Cora! Mary!
Well, it's so good to have you back again!
How are you, Vinnie?
We've been so worried about you.
Oh, I'm fine now.
Did you have fun in Springfield?
Oh, it was wonderful.
John, my! You're still growing!
Thank you, Cousin Cora.
John, go get their baggage.
There's Whitney.
Whitney, how are you. darling?
Fine, thank you.
And little Harlan.
Have you been a good boy?
No...
Clare, the girls are here.
Cousin Clare!
Here we are again!
My my!
It's so nice to be back!
How do you do, Mr. Day?
How do you do?
Come in sit down and have some breakfast with us.
Oh, we had breakfast at the depot.
Well, we've practically finished ours.
I haven't finished my breakfast!
Well then, sit down, Clare!
Come have a cup of coffee anyway.
Mary, sit over there.
Cora...
Maggie, clear those places.
My my!
This seems so natural.
Clare, don't let your kippers get cold!
Maggie, serve some coffee.
Yes ma'am.
Where's Clarence?
He must be upstairs moving his things so you can have his room again.
Oh oh Vinnie, we can't stay overnight.
Grandpa Evans has been failing very fast, and that's why I have to hurry back.
We're leaving on the 5 o'clock train this afternoon.
Well, Cora, it certainly is good to see again!
[doorbell ringing]
Well, who can that be?
Well, this time it can't be another special delivery letter for Clarence!
Ah, while you were in Springfield, our postman was kept pretty busy! Hehehe...
It's the cab, ma'am.
Cab? What cab?
The cab that's to take us to Audubon Park.
Oh, who's going to Audubon Park?
We all are!
Cora, the most wonderful thing has happened!
Clare is going to be baptized this morning.
Vinnie, what you saying?
I'm saying you're going to be baptized this morning.
I am NOT going to be baptized this morning or any other morning!
You promised yesterday that as soon as I sent that pug dog that you'd be baptized.
I never said anything remotely like that!
Clarence was right there and heard you!
That's why I ordered the cab!
The cab!
Vinnie, you send that right back!
I'll do nothing of the kind!
I'm going to see that you go to heaven!
I can't go to heaven in a cab!
Oh!
Well, you can start in a cab!
I'm not sure they'll ever let you into heaven!
But I know they won't unless you're baptized!
They can't keep me out of heaven on a technicality!
Clare! Stop quibbling!
You may as well face it.
You've got to make your peace with God!
Until you stirred him up,
I had no trouble with God!
Harlan. Whitney.
Come get your Sunday hats.
Clarence! John!
Yes, Mother?
Hurry, we're ready to go.
Oh, my prayer book.
Harlan, come let me fix your tie.
Vinnie, are you mad?
Was it your plan that my own children should witness this indignity?
Why Clare!
They'll be proud of you!
I suppose Harlan is to be my godfather!
Vinnie, I won't go through with this thing! That's final.
Well Clare dear, if you feel that way about it...
I do!
Well, we won't take the children with us!
I'm not talking about the children.
I'm ready, Mother.
Oh John!
Vinnie, I haven't time for anything like that this morning.
I've got to take John down to my office with me and give him the money to buy back that dog medicine.
But it wasn't dog medicine, sir!
Young man, we're starting downtown this minute.
You'll do no such thing!
You gave me your sacred promise that day I almost died.
Yes, and she would have died if we hadn't given her some of that medicine.
That proves it's good medicine.
You gave your mother some of that dog medicine?!
John, you didn't?!
Yes, we did, Mother.
We put some in your tea that morning.
Oh John!
Do you realize you might have killed your mother?
You did kill Mrs. Sprague's dog!
John, I'll have to give considerable thought as to how you are to be punished for this.
But Clare...
No, Vinnie.
When I think of that day! What...
Why, we might have lost you!
You're all right now, thank heaven.
But what I went through that afternoon...
The way I felt... Well,
I'll never forget it!
You've forgotten it already.
What do you mean?
That was the day you gave me your sacred promise.
Yes, but I wouldn't have given you my promise, if I hadn't thought you were dying.
And you wouldn't have almost died if
John hadn't given you that dog medicine!
Don't you see?
Well, the whole thing is illegal!
Suppose I had died. It wouldn't make any difference to you.
You don't care whether we meet in heaven or not.
You don't care whether you ever see me in the children again.
Oh Vinnie! You're not being fair to me.
It's all right,
Clare.
If you don't love us enough, there's nothing we can do about it.
But that has nothing to do with it!
I love my family as much as any man.
All my life, I've struggled and worked just to...
Oh God.
There's that cab.
Vinnie, you're not well enough to go all the way to Audubon.
Oh, I'm well enough if we ride.
But that trip would take all morning!
And those cabs cost a dollar an hour!
This is one of their best cabs!
This costs $2 an hour!
Well then why aren't you ready?!
Get your hat on!
Oh, tarnation!
Hallelujah! Amen!
Young lady, if I hadn't been for you, no one would have known whether I was baptized or not!
Oh God!
Good morning, Mr. Day.
Going to the office?
NO! I'm going to be baptized, damn it!
For what we are about to receive may the Lord make us thankful.
Amen.
It's all over,
Mrs. Thingummy.
The old story.
No wedding ring, I see.
Good night.
Pray come in, sir.
Thank you, ma'am.
- May I?
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Thank you, sir.
- Ahhh.
This is indeed a pleasure, sir.
Now, you mustn't be faint at what I'm going to say.
You've had a long walk, or I wouldn't mention it.
Will you take a little drop of something, Mr. Bumble?
- Not a drop.
- Just a little drop... with a little hot water and a lump of sugar.
- What is it?
- I'll not deceive you, Mr. B.
It's gin.
I'm obliged to keep a little in the house... to put in the infants' daffy when they ain't well.
You're a very humane woman,
Mrs. Corney.
I shall take an early opportunity of mentioning it to the Board, Mrs. Corney.
Thank you, sir.
I drink to your health with cheerfulness, Mrs. Corney.
We are forgetting business, ma'am.
The child that was half baptized
Oliver Twist is nine year old today.
He's the worst disposed boy I ever did see.
Small wonder. We've never been able to discover his parentage.
- How come that he has a name, then?
- I invented it.
- You, Mr. Bumble?
- I, Mrs. Corney.
I name all our foundlings in alphabetical order.
The last was an "S."
"Swabble" I named him.
This was a "T."
"Twist" I named him.
Why, you're quite a literary character, sir.
Well, well, perhaps
I may be, Mrs. Corney.
Perhaps I may be.
Now, let me see the boy.
Twist!
Come here!
Make a bow to the gentleman.
You're to come along with me, boy.
You're to be presented to the Board.
Gentlemen, it is my considered opinion... that our charity is being presumed upon.
- Here, here.
- Here, here.
This workhouse has become a place of entertainment for the poorer classes.
Gentlemen, it is our duty to set this to rights.
- We'll stop it in no time.
- Here, here.
Come in.
Case number six.
Bow to the Board.
What's your name, boy?
Oliver.
Oliver Twist, sir.
Do you know it's your birthday?
- No, sir.
- Boy's a fool.
Boy, listen to me.
You know you're an orphan.
What is that, sir?
- Boy's a fool. I thought he was.
- Hush.
You know you've got no father or mother and were brought up by the parish.
- Don't you?
- Yes, sir.
I hope you say your prayers every night.
Yes, sir.
And pray for the people who feed you and take care of you.
Yes, sir.
Well, you're going to be educated and taught a useful trade.
You'll begin to pick oakum tomorrow morning at 6:00.
For this abounding provision,
O Lord, we thank thee.
Amen.
Please, sir,
I want some more.
- What?
- What?
- What?
- Asked for more?
- Ah, good morning, Mr. Bumble, sir.
- Good morning.
I've just taken the measure of the two women that died last night.
Coffins are looking up,
Mr. Sowerberry.
Ah, thank you.
You'll make your fortune,
Mr. Sowerberry.
The prices allowed by the Board are very small, Mr. Bumble.
So are the coffins.
Well, well, Mr. Bumble, there's no denying that.
- But we must have some profit.
- Oh, is that so?
By the way, you don't know of anybody who wants a boy, do you?
A parochial apprentice.
Liberal terms, Mr. Sowerberry.
Liberal terms.
I'll take him.
- Oliver.
- Yes, sir?
Pull that cap off your eye.
And hold your head up some.
Be good enough to tell Mr. Sowerberry that the beadle is here.
Oh, please do come in, sir.
Is that you, Mr. Bumble?
No one else, Mr. Sowerberry.
Here, I brought the boy.
Ah.
- So this is the boy, is it?
- Yes, sir.
Who's that?
My dear, this is the boy from the workhouse I told you of.
He's very small.
He is rather small, ma'am.
He is small, there's no denying it.
But he'll grow,
Mrs. Sowerberry.
I dare say he will, on our food and our drink.
There, get downstairs, little bag of bones.
Charlotte!
Yes, ma'am?
Give the boy some of the cold bits put by for Trip.
Yes, ma'am.
I suppose you're the new boy, ain't ya?
Yes, sir.
- There you are.
- Oh, thank you, ma'am.
On the box, Workhouse.
On the box.
Workhouse, do you know who I am?
No, sir.
I'm Mr. Noah Claypole.
And you're under me, so don't you forget it.
No, sir.
- Are you done?
- Yes, ma'am.
Then come with me.
Come on. Get up.
Your bed's under the counter.
- You don't mind, I suppose?
- No, ma'am.
Doesn't much matter whether you do or you don't, for you can't sleep anywhere else.
Here. Take this.
Get in here.
A very good-looking boy, that, my dear.
He need be.
He eats enough.
There's an expression of melancholy in his face, my dear, which is very interesting.
- Well?
- He'd make a delightful mute, my love.
I don't mean a regular mute to attend grown-up people, my dear, but only for children's practice.
Depend upon it. It would have a most superb effect.
Do you want a coffin?
I'll fetch the missus.
No. No, no.
I want to see the boy.
Who? Workhouse?
He's on the job.
Who are you?
I knew his mother.
Nursed her when she died.
Died in the workhouse, eh?
I haven't got much time.
I've got to see him.
Missus! Charlotte!
Missus!
Come in.
How is she this evening?
She hasn't much strength left in her.
She's troubled in her mind.
And when the fits aren't on... and that's not often... she keeps saying she's got something to tell.
She wants to see the matron.
You'd better fetch her.
Come in.
Yes?
If you please, mistress, old Sally's a-going fast.
Well, what's that to me?
I can't keep her alive, can I?
She says she's got something to tell that you must hear.
She'll never die quiet until you come, mistress.
- Did she say any more, Martha dear?
- Not a word.
- Cold night, Mrs. Corney.
- Very cold indeed, sir.
If you have to wait long,
I shall be surprised.
Put the light on the floor.
She won't see it there.
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.
It won't be long, mistress.
None of us have to wait long.
It'll come soon enough for us all.
- Who's that?
- Hush, hush.
- Who's that?
- Lie down, dear. Lie down.
Come here.
Come here.
- Listen.
- Yes?
In this very room, in this very bed...
I once nursed a pretty, young creature.
She gave birth to a boy and died.
Go on. Yes?
They would have treated him better if they'd have known it all.
Known what?
Let me think.
It was the year...
Never mind about the year.
What about him?
Aye, what about him?
What about...
I know. Uh...
- Turn them away.
- Mrs. Annie, dear.
- Make haste. Make haste.
- Get out! Go on! Get out! Hurry!
Get out!
Right. Go on.
What?
- Stone dead.
- What was it, mistress?
Nothing. Nothing to tell after all. Nothing.
Come up and sit by the fire, Noah dear.
Oliver, shut that door behind Mr. Noah's back.
I saved a nice bit of bacon from the master's breakfast for you, Noah dear.
Oliver, here's your tea, and take them bits.
And make haste, 'cause they want you to mind shop.
- D'you hear?
- D'you hear, Workhouse?
Workhouse, how's your mother?
- She's dead.
- What'd she die of, Workhouse?
They said she died of a broken heart.
What set you a-sniveling?
- Not you.
- Oh, not me, eh?
No, not you. You'd better stop saying things about my mother.
"Better stop." Workhouse, don't be impudent.
You know, Workhouse, your mother must have been a regular, right-down bad 'un.
What did you say?
A regular, right-down bad 'un, Workhouse.
And it's a great deal better,
Workhouse, that she died when she did, or else she'd have been doing hard labor in Bridewell.
Or transported or hung, which is more likely than either, isn't it?
Stop it!
Sorry! Help!
Help me!
- Noah!
- Charlotte! Help! Charlotte!
No, no! Help!
Oliver!
Help! Aaah!
- The coal hole!
- No!
Yes! Get him in!
You little villain, you.
I'll kill you!
So long!
Oh! Noah!
Yes, ma'am?
Fetch the beadle.
Well, ma'am!
Where is this audacious young savage?
Let me out! Let me out!
Let me out! Let me out!
- Oliver.
- Yes?
Do you know this here voice, sir?
Yes!
Ain't you afraid of it, sir?
Ain't you a-trembling while I speak, sir?
No!
Let me out!
Let me out! Let...
The boy must be mad!
It's not madness, ma'am.
It's meat.
- Let me out! Let me out!
- What?
Meat, ma'am. If you'd kept the boy on gruel, this would never have happened.
What's the meaning of this?
Young Twist has turned vicious, sir.
- Tried to murder me, sir.
- He nearly killed the missus!
- You're a nice young fellow, ain't ya?
- He said things about my mother.
- By all accounts, she deserved them!
- That's a lie!
Don't spare him, now.
Don't spare him.
Get up to bed.
He comes from a bad family, sir.
Excitable natures,
Mrs. Sowerberry.
That mother of his made her way here against difficulties and pain... that would have killed any well-disposed woman weeks before.
My parochial apologies, sir.
Twenty guineas, sir!
Twenty guineas. Did I hear twenty-two. Twenty-two guineas, sir.
And it stands at 22!
Time is running out, gentlemen!
- Staying in London?
- Yes.
- Got any lodgings?
- No.
- Money?
- No.
- Hungry?
- Yes.
Follow me.
Come here!
- Who's traveling?
- A new pal.
Come in.
Wait 'ere.
Do you want him?
Come on in.
'Ere he is, Fagin.
My friend Oliver Twist.
Very glad to see you, Oliver.
Very. Aren't we, my dears?
- Yes!
- How far have you come?
I've been walking for seven days.
- Walking for seven days?
- Beak's order, eh?
Do you know what the beak is, my dear?
A bird's mouth, sir.
Sit down, all of you!
A beak is a magistrate, my dear.
Dodger, take out the sausages.
Sit down, Oliver.
There're a great many of them, ain't there, my dear?
- Yes, sir.
- We just looked them out for the wash.
I hope you've been at work, Dodger.
I 'ave.
Good boy.
Good boy.
And free wipes.
Ingenious worker, ain't he, Oliver?
Very indeed, sir.
You'd like to make pocket handkerchiefs... as easily as the Artful Dodger, wouldn't you, my dear?
- Yes, if you teach me, sir.
- We will, my dear, we will.
To work.
Terry, Fred.
Sit down.
Charlie, Dodger.
Oliver.
Oliver.
Clever dogs.
Clever dogs.
Never blowed on old Fagin.
Why are you awake?
Speak up, boy, quick!
I couldn't sleep any longer, sir.
- What have you seen?
- Nothing, sir.
You were not awake an hour ago?
No, no indeed, sir.
- Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.
Tsk, tsk, my dear.
I only tried to frighten you.
Did you see any of those pretty things, dear?
Yes, sir.
They're, uh, they're mine, Oliver... all I have to live on in my old age.
They call me a miser.
May I get up now, sir?
Certainly, dear.
Certainly.
They've gone to work, Oliver.
Make 'em your models.
Do everything they bid you do.
Take their advice in all things.
Especially the Artful Dodger's.
He'll be a great man himself one day and will make you one too.
Is my handkerchief hanging out of my pocket, dear?
Yes, sir.
See if you can take it without my feeling it.
- Is it gone?
- Yes, here it is.
Ah, you clever boy.
Here's a shilling for you.
Oh, thank you, sir.
If you go on this way, you'll be the greatest man of the time.
He'll do.
Stop, thief!
Stop, thief!
Stop, thief! Stop, thief!
Stop, thief!
Stop, thief! Stop!
Stop, thief!
Stop, thief!
- Stop, thief!
- Thief! Thief!
Give him some air.
He don't deserve it.
- Is this the boy, sir?
- Yes, I'm afraid it is.
Afraid?
That's a good 'un.
Poor little fellow.
He's hurt himself.
I did that, sir.
I stopped him.
I cut my knuckles against his mouth.
Come on, get up!
Make way there!
Make way!
- Come on!
- Don't hurt him, officer.
Oh, no, I won't. Come on, you devil.
Hold the noise!
Do you wanna get grabbed?
I can't help it.
I can't help it.
What'll Fagin say?
Where's Oliver?
Where's the boy?
What's become of the boy?
Speak or I'll throttle you!
Let go of me!
The traps have got him, and that's all about it.
What's it all about, Fagin?
It's lucky the pot didn't hit me, or I might have settled someone.
Come in, Mr. Sikes.
Come in.
None of your mister-ing.
You know my name.
Come in, you sneaking cur.
What're you hanging about there for?
Go on, get in, will ya?
Will you take a drink, Bill?
See ya don't poison it, neither.
Here.
What's he been up to?
Ill-treating the boys again, eh?
You avaricious offense.
- You seem out of humor, Bill.
- Yeah, maybe I am.
And you seem kind of out of sorts too.
What's in the wind, Fagin?
It's the new boy.
The traps have got him.
What of it?
He may say something that'll get us into trouble.
That's very likely.
You're blowed upon, Fagin.
I'm afraid, you see, if the game was up with us, it might be up with a good many more.
It would come out rather worse for you than it would for me.
Wouldn't it, my dear?
Oh, dear.
Somebody ought to go and find out what's going on at the police court.
Somebody ought to go there, Fagin!
Go on.
Charlie.
- And about time too.
- Ah, Nancy.
- The very thing. She's a clever girl.
- Here's to her.
- Nancy will go, won't you, my dear?
- Wheres?
Only just to the police court, my dear.
What do you say?
That it won't do, Fagin, so it's no use you trying it on.
- What do you mean by that?
- Well, what'd I say, Bill?
You're the only one for it. No one around here knows anything about you.
And as I don't want 'em to neither, it's rather more no than yes with me, Bill.
She'll go, Fagin.
Oh, no, she won't, Fagin.
Oh, yes, she will, Fagin.
Yes?
Is there a little boy here?
- Who are you?
- His sister
You'll have to wait.
The case is on now.
Now, what is the charge against this boy?
Stealing a handkerchief,
Your Worship.
- I'd rather not press the case.
- Hold your tongue, sir!
- Are there any witnesses?
- None, Your Worship.
What is your name?
What is your name?
He's been hurt, and I fear...
I really fear he's very ill.
Oh, yes, I dare say.
Come now. None of your tricks here, you young vagabond.
What is your name?
What's your name?
Hmm?
He says his name's
Tom White, Your Worship.
Very well.
Where does he live?
Where do you live?
Where he can,
Your Worship.
Please, sir, could I have some water?
Stop the nonsense!
Don't try to make a fool of me!
I'm afraid he really is ill, Your Worship.
I know better.
Take care. He's going to fall.
Stand away!
Let him if he likes.
How do you propose to deal with the case, sir?
Quiet! What's this?
Who is this?
I keep the bookstore.
I saw it all. It was another boy.
Why didn't you come before?
Couldn't get a soul to mind the shop.
Swear the man.
They bring him out of the court fainted.
He gets in a carriage with this gentleman, and they drive off.
He'll blow on us, Fagin, for certain!
That's the boy, is it?
That's the boy.
Nice-looking boy, isn't he?
I don't know.
I only know two sorts of boys: mealy boys and beef-faced boys.
And which is he?
Mealy.
Shhh.
Good night, Mrs. Bedwin.
Good night, sir.
Is Bedwin in the habit of counting the plate at night?
Because if she doesn't find a tablespoon or two missing one sunny morning,
I'll be content to eat my head, sir.
Your move.
Where does he come from?
Who is he? What is he?
If that boy doesn't deceive you, my good friend,
I'll eat my head and yours too.
- We shall see.
- We will. We will.
- Where am I?
- Hush, my dear.
You must be very quiet, or you'll be ill again.
You've been very bad.
Lie down again. That's it.
There.
Don't mind me, my dear.
It's all over now.
I'm rather hoarse this morning, Bedwin.
I'm afraid
I've got a cold.
- Now, how do you feel, my dear?
- Very happy, sir.
Good. Have you given him any nourishment, Bedwin?
He's going to have a basin of beautiful, strong broth, sir.
Mm-hmm. A couple of glasses of port wine would do him far more good.
- Wouldn't they, Tom White?
- My name's Oliver, sir.
Oliver?
Oliver White, hmm?
No, sir. Twist.
Oliver Twist.
Hmm, that's a queer name.
What made you tell the magistrate your name was White?
I never told him, sir.
Some mistake.
Some mistake, hmm?
Ah, have your broth, young man.
We must get you strong again.
As soon as you're well enough, we must have a little chat.
Oh, thank you very much, sir.
Fool, bungler, liar.
I paid you good money to make an end to the business.
One sniveling boy... and you have to lose him!
I'm worse off now than if I'd never set eyes on you... and farther still from what should be mine.
What do I get?
My money back?
No, no, my dear, not that.
I'll give you hope.
Do you know the workhouse where the boy was born?
Of course.
I traced him from there.
Then you must go back, my dear.
You must go back. Listen.
Tomorrow, two months it was done.
It seems a age.
Are you gonna sit there snoring all day?
I shall sit here as long as I think proper, ma'am.
And though
I was not snoring,
I shall snore, gape, sneeze, laugh or cry... as the humor strikes me, such being my prerogative.
- Your prerogative.
- I said the word, ma'am.
The prerogative of a man is to command.
And what's the prerogative of a woman, in the name of goodness?
- To obey, ma'am,
- Huh! as your late, unfortunate husband should have taught you.
And then, perhaps, he might have been alive now.
I wish he were, poor man.
You brute!
Cry your hardest, ma'am.
It opens the lungs, washes the countenance, exercises the eyes and softens down the temper.
So cry away.
Brute!
You blasphemer!
Talk about your prerogative again, if you dare!
Get up!
Get away from here... or I might do something desperate!
Certainly, my dear.
Certainly.
You were the beadle here once, were you not?
I was.
Parochial beadle.
What are you now?
Master of the workhouse.
Good.
Now listen to me.
I want some information.
Carry your memory back ten years last winter.
The scene: the workhouse.
And the time: night.
The place: the lying-in room.
- A boy was born.
- A good many boys.
He was apprentice down here to a coffin maker.
You mean young Twist?
There wasn't a obstinate...
It's not of him
I want to hear.
It's of a woman.
The hand that nursed his mother.
Where is she?
She died last winter.
One moment.
Yes?
There was a woman with her when she died.
Can I find her?
Only through me.
It will be worth her while.
What if I've paid you for nothing?
You can take it away again.
I'm a woman here alone and unprotected.
Not alone, my dear, nor unprotected, neither.
You're a fool.
You better hold your tongue.
He'd better have it cut out if he can't speak in a lower tone.
Now, let's hear your story.
You were with this hand the night she died?
- Yes.
- There was no one by?
No. She asked that we should be alone.
- Get out!
- Go on.
- She spoke of a young mother...
- Aye. whom she'd nursed in that same bed.
Yes. What of her?
I robbed her.
She wasn't cold when I stole it.
Stole what?
It. The only thing she had. Gold.
Gold? Go on.
What of it?
She chose me to keep it safe.
Yes. The boy's name?
They called him Oliver.
- Yes.
- I haven't told you all, have I?
No, no. Be quick.
She'd run away.
Her father...
Yes?
I was to tell him that...
What were you to tell him?
What?
What?
She said more.
You're lying.
She never uttered another word.
- But it was then that it happened.
- What?
A scrap of paper?
What was it?
- A pawnbroker's ticket.
- Yes.
The time was out in two days, so I redeemed the pledge.
Where is it now?
There.
- And this is all?
- All.
Is that what you expected to get from us?
It is.
Bless us and save us.
- Come in and wash your hands.
- Why? What's the matter?
Mr. Brownlow wants to see you, and we must make you smart as sixpence.
Come in.
Oh, come in, Oliver.
Come in.
Yes, there are a good many books, are there not, my boy?
I never saw so many, sir.
How would you like to grow up a clever man and write books, eh?
I think I'd rather read them, sir.
What? Don't you want to be a book writer?
I think I'd rather be a bookseller, sir.
Well said, my boy.
Very well said.
Now, now, Oliver,
I want you to pay great attention to what I'm going to say.
You're not going to send me away, sir?
No, my dear, I'm not going to send you away unless you give me cause.
I'll never do that, sir. Never.
Good.
Somehow I feel... that you and I are going to be good friends.
Oh, thank you, sir.
I trust you, Oliver, and I find myself more interested on your behalf than I can well account for, even to myself.
Are you fond of pictures, Oliver?
I don't quite know, sir.
Now, that is a portrait, a likeness.
She's very pretty, sir.
Yes, she was very pretty.
Any muffins for tea?
Hello. What's that?
The young Oliver Twist.
You don't mean to say that's the boy who had the fever, I hope?
That's all over now.
Come and speak to my young friend.
How are you, boy?
A great deal better, thank you, sir.
Hmm. And when are we going to hear an account... of his history, eh, my friend?
I think we'll have our tea first, eh, Oliver?
- Is that the bookseller?
- Yes, sir.
- There are some to go back.
- He's gone, sir.
Oh, I wanted to return some tonight.
Send Oliver with them. He'll be sure to deliver them safely, you know.
Yes, do let me go, sir.
I'll run all the way.
You shall go, my boy.
The books are on a chair by my table.
Fetch them down.
Let me see. He'll be back in 20 minutes at the longest.
So you really expect him to come back, do you?
- Well, don't you?
- No, I do not.
The boy has a new suit of clothes on his back, a set of valuable books under his arm... and a five-pound note in his pocket.
If ever that boy returns to this house, sir, I'll eat my head.
There.
Good night, dear.
Oliver!
- Oliver, Oliver, you naughty boy!
- Help!
Oh, my dear little brother.
I've found him.
- Thank heavens I've found him.
- Let go of me!
- You cruel boy. Come home directly.
- What's the matter, ma'am?
He ran away near a month ago from his parents.
- Hardworking, respectable people.
- I didn't!
He joined a set of thieves and nearly broke his mother's heart.
- You little wretch!
- I'm not!
- I haven't got a mother.
- Go home, you little brute.
- I live in Pentonville.
- Oh, listen how he braves it out.
- Come home to your mother, will you?
- I don't belong to them!
What's this?
He's been stealing again.
Oh, no, Bill.
Come on!
That's the only way to bring him to his senses.
Do him good too.
Yeah, and he'll get it too. come on, you young villain.
Fagin! Dodger! Look!
Aye, let's have a glimpse.
Delighted to see you looking so well, my dear.
Why didn't you write and say you was coming?
We'd have got something hot for supper.
What's that?
That's mine, Fagin.
No, no, my dear.
Mine, Bill, mine.
You shall have the books.
If that ain't mine and Nancy's,
I'll take the boy back again.
Now, come on, hand over, will you?
Where is it?
This is hardly fair, is it, Nancy?
Fair or not fair, give it here, you avaricious old skeleton.
Give it.
Take the books if you're fond of reading.
If you ain't, sell 'em.
- Help! Help! Help!
- Bull's-eye!
He'll tear the boy to pieces!
- Serve him right.
- No, you don't!
You stand off of me, or I'll push your head in.
I don't care!
I don't care!
Get out!
- What's the matter here?
- The girl's gone mad.
No, she ain't, Fagin.
No, she ain't. Don't think it.
Then keep quiet, will you?
No, I won't do that neither.
What do you think of that?
So you wanted to get away, my dear, did you, eh?
Wanted to get assistance?
Called for the police, did you?
We'll soon cure you of that, my young master!
No you don't, Fagin! You've got the boy. What more do you want?
Let him be, or I'll put that mark on you that'll send me to the gallows!
Why Nancy, you're more clever than ever tonight.
You're acting beautiful, dear.
Am I? Then take care
I don't overdo it.
- You'll be the worse for it if I do.
- What do you mean by this?
You're a nice, pretty subject for the boy to make a friend of.
So help me I am!
I wish I'd been struck dead before lending hand to bring him here.
He's a thief, a devil, a liar and all that's bad from this night on.
Isn't that enough of the old wretch without blows?
Come, come, Sikes, we must have civil words. Civil words, Bill.
Civil words!
Civil words, you villain!
Yes, you deserve them from me!
I thieved for you when I was a child not half his age, and I've thieved for you ever since!
If you have, it is your living.
Aye, it is.
It is my living, and the cold, wet, dirty streets are my home, and you're the wretch that drove me to them long ago... and that'll keep me there day and night...
I'll do you mischief, a mischief worse than that... if you say much more.
No! No!
Oh, Bill.
That's the worst of having to deal with women, my dears.
But they're clever, and we can't get on without 'em.
Dodger, show Oliver to bed.
- He hadn't better wear his best suit.
- Certainly not.
The Dodger shall give you another suit, my dear, for fear that Sunday one should get stolen.
Well, Mrs. Bedwin?
I'm afraid he's lost his way, sir.
You mean he never went there, eh?
There you are.
The boy's an impostor.
It can't be. It can't be.
What do you mean, it can't be?
You old women never believe anything but quack doctors and lying story books.
He was a dear, grateful, gentle child, sir.
I know what children are and have done these 40 years.
People who can't say the same shouldn't say anything.
That's my opinion.
That'll be all, Bedwin.
Well?
I'll take the liberty, if you'll allow me, of helping us both to a glass of sherry.
Now in the dark a shorter maid...
Why don't you join us,
Mr. Fagin?
Delighted, I'm sure.
What can I do for you? Monks?
I expected him here before now.
Lay it on, will you, you stupid brute.
Don't you know the devil when he's got a greatcoat on?
- Ah, Nancy.
- Well?
Well, my dear, it's about the crib at Chertsey.
- Well, what about it?
- Oh, you know what I mean, my dear.
- He knows what I mean, don't he?
- No, he don't.
And don't stand there talking to me in hints, as though you weren't the first what thought about the robbery.
Shhh!
Somebody will hear us.
Let 'em hear.
I don't care.
There, there, my dear.
It was only my caution. Nothing more.
Now, Bill,
I've got the boy. You can...
What's the matter?
I don't know whether she might be out of sorts as she was before.
Go on, Fagin, tell him it's Oliver.
You're a clever one, my dear.
The sharpest girl I ever saw.
It was about Oliver
I was going to speak.
- Him!
- It's time he began to earn his bread.
Besides, the others are all too big.
He's about the size I want...
And will do everything you want if you frighten him enough.
When is it to be done?
Ah, to be sure.
When is it to be done, eh?
Tomorrow night.
Good. It's all arranged about bringing off the swag?
It's all planned. Now you hold your tongue and keep your melting pot ready.
That's all you have to do.
Now leave us alone, will you?
- What's the news?
- Great.
- And now, may I introduce to you...
- So is mine. a charming young singer who's never appeared in public before.
Miss Lucy Willow.
This morning early
My melody was such
I in my tea took brandy
And I took a drop too much
This is the only proof of the boy's identity, so I've got the young devil's money at last.
Now you can do what you like with him.
Get him hauled up for some felony, drag him through every jail in town.
It's not easy to train him to the business.
That's your affair.
If... it's not likely, mind... but if the worst should come to the worst...
It's no fault of mine.
Mind that, Fagin.
I had no hand in this.
Get out!
My old pal and me go to fighting
Like all the neighborhood souls
I has one with him then he has one with me
Then we come to blows
Look at the drunkards of London
Lying all over the place
There isn't a doubt
It's lovely, look out
For the human race
Artful, are you awake?
- What's the matter?
- Listen carefully, my dear.
I want you to do a piece of work for me... that needs great care and caution.
- What is it?
- I want you to dodge a woman.
I'll do that...
What do you want me to dodge her for? Not to...
Not to anything but to tell me where she goes, who she sees and what she says... and to bring back all the information you can.
Who is she?
One of us.
What'll you give me?
If you do it well, my dear, a guinea.
One guinea, and that's what I never gave yet... for such a pleasant piece of work.
- Barkers for me, Bill.
- Here.
- The persuader?
- I've got it.
Scrape, keys, center bits, darkies.
Nothing forgotten.
You take the crowbar.
Take heed.
He's a rough man. Mind.
- What's that?
- The boy.
Oh, one of
Mr. Fagin's lads?
Yes.
It's cold, Nancy dear.
It seems to go right through one.
It must be a piercer to find its way through your heart.
Come 'ere, young 'un.
Come here!
- Do you know what this is?
- Yes, sir.
Well, if you speak a word when we're outside, you'll get a bullet through your head without warning.
So if you do make up your mind to talk, you'd better say your prayers first.
Now then, look sharp.
We're late as it is.
Come on.
Sir.
You've come in consequence of having seen my advertisement?
Not here, sir. I'm afraid to speak.
Down the steps.
Why do you bring me to this dark and dismal place?
Because there are those who would surely murder me if they knew I was here.
Young woman, if you have any intelligence of this poor child, in heaven's name put me in possession of it.
Do you know a man named Monks?
Monks? What do you know of this man?
Before I tell you, sir, have I your promise... that my secret will be strictly kept?
I'll not turn on the others because, bad as they are, they never turned on me.
Have I your promise for that?
You have.
And nobody will ever learn how you know what you do?
Never.
Some time ago, soon after Oliver was taken from your house in Pentonville,
I saw this man Monks for the first time... and the other day
I saw him again.
He came to a place
I know called...
There. Take care of that, and do the most you can with it.
It's been trouble enough to get.
What are you looking at me like that for?
He's gone mad.
I've got that to tell you will make you worse than me.
Eh? Well, look sharp, or Nance will think I'm lost.
Lost? She's pretty well settled that in her own mind already.
Open your mouth and say what you've got to say in plain words.
- Suppose that lad that's lying there...
- Well?
Suppose that lad was to peach, to blow upon us all, first stealing out at nights to find the right folks for the purpose, then having a meeting with them in the streets... not grabbed, trapped, tried and brought to it on bread and water, but of his own fancy.
- Suppose he did this? What then?
- I'd smash his head in.
What if I did it?
I that knows so much... and could hang so many besides myself?
I'd beat your brains out.
- You would?
- Try me.
If it was Charlie or the Dodger or...
No matter who,
I'd do the same.
Dodger. Dodger.
Poor lad. He's tired.
Tired with watching for her so long.
Yes, watching for her, Bill.
What do you mean?
Dodger. Dodger.
Tell me that again, once again just for him to hear.
- Tell you what?
- That about Nancy.
What about her?
- You followed her?
- Yes.
- To London Bridge?
- Yes.
- Where she met a gentleman?
- So she did.
A gentleman she'd gone to of her own accord... who asked her to give up her pals, which she did?
- Well, she...
- She did all this.
She told it all, every word, without a threat, without a murmur.
She did, did she not?
All right, that's just about what it was.
- What did she say about the boy?
- I told you that before.
Again. Tell it again.
Well, he asked her why she hadn't brought Ollie with her.
Why? Why?
Tell him that.
Because he'd gone out on a job with him.
What more of him?
Tell him that. Tell him that.
Well, that she'd bring him to London Bridge... tomorrow, midday.
Yes? Why?
'Cause he'd be asleep.
She made me laugh when she said it.
Said what?
That she was gonna give him a drink with rotenone.
Get me out of here!
Bill. Bill!
- Bill.
- Don't speak to me. It's not safe.
- You won't...
- Let me out!
You won't be too violent, Bill.
I mean, not too violent for safety!
Get up!
Oh, it's you, Bill.
It is. Get up!
There's light enough for what I've got to do.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Oh, no! No!
Bill! Bill! Bill!
Speak to me!
What have I done?
You were watched tonight.
Every single word you said was heard.
Oh, I've been true to you!
By my soul I have!
Give me time!
A little time!
Good boy. Good boy.
Bill. Fagin lied, Bill.
I didn't tell.
He deceived you.
He deceived you.
He deceived you.
She told all her pals.
Not brought to it on bread and water, but of her own fancy.
She did. She did.
She did.
Murder.
Brutal murder.
Murder.
Brutal murder.
In the early hours of this morning, a young woman was brutally beaten to death... by one William Sikes.
If any person or persons...
"I first met this girl at London Bridge.
I went there in response to an anonymous letter.
I promised not to reveal the names of her associates, but in face of this terrible crime, I no longer consider that promise binding."
Lock the door on the outside and come when I ring.
Yes, sir.
- Where is my grandson?
- Grandson?
I warn you that every word that passed between you... and your criminal associates is known to me.
Is this a trick to deprive me of my inheritance?
You have no inheritance, for, as you know, my daughter had a child, and it was you who, for your own gain, suppressed the only proofs of his birth and parentage.
You can prove nothing. Your daughter ran away and was never heard of again.
Coward! Liar!
Where is Oliver Twist?
I know nothing of him.
We shall see.
Sit down.
How do you do, sir?
I hope you are well.
- Take him away!
- Idiot!
It only remains for me to tell you that neither of you... will ever be employed in a position of trust again.
You may go.
Fool!
I hope, sir, that this unfortunate little circumstance... will not deprive me of my parochial office.
Indeed it will, and think yourself well off besides.
It was all Mrs. Bumble.
She would do it.
That is no excuse. You were present at the sale of the locket, and indeed are the more guilty of the two in the eye of the law, for the law supposes that your wife acts under your direction.
If the law supposes that, then the law is a ass, a idiot.
If that's the eye of the law, then the law is a bachelor, and the worst I wish the law is that his eye may be opened by experience.
My experience!
It's Charlie.
- It's all up!
- What's the matter?
They've got scouts out everywhere!
Now, what's the news?
They've nabbed Monks.
And Sikes?
What about him?
They say he'll be took tonight.
They're looking for his dog.
Fool.
Come here, will ya?
There.
Take him away.
The dog!
Follow the dog!
Follow the dog!
It's the dog!
They've got his dog!
Don't leave us in the dark.
Who is it?
What are you gonna do? Sell me or let me lie here till the hunt's over?
We're in this together,
Fagin. Lock up.
Get me a drink.
Get me a drink, will ya?
Young 'un!
Blast you!
Can't you say something?
Don't you know me, Dodger?
Don't come near me.
I'm not afraid of him!
If they come here,
I'll give him up, I will!
You'll what?
- Come here!
- Get back.
- What?
- They're here.
Get that table here.
Help! Help! Help!
He's here! Help!
In the king's name!
I'm going out over the roof.
I'll cheat you yet!
Young 'un, you're coming with me.
Get me a rope.
Come here!
Heave!
Heave!
Heave!
Heave!
Don't go without me, Bill!
Heave!
Heave!
Strike them all dead.
What right have you to butcher me?
Keep close to me, young 'un.
Fagin! Fagin!
They've got Fagin!
Round the stack!
Get on.
Sikes!
Give me the rope!
Get that rope round!
Fifty pounds for the man who rescues the boy.
Get it round there!
Help!
Help!
We've got the boy, sir.
They've got the boy!
He's come back, sir.
I knew he would.
- Merry Christmas, Mr. Higgins.
- Merry Christmas, Jo.
- Did you hurt yourself, Jo?
- No, I never hurt myself.
- Where have you been, Jo?
- Skating.
And it was splendid, my Beth.
Look, we've just finished trimming the tree.
Christmas won't be Christmas without any presents.
It's dreadful to be poor.
I especially feel it, because
I remember when we used to be rich.
I remember, too.
I certainly don't think it's fair... for some girls to have lots of lovely things... and other prettier girls have nothing at all.
We are better off than a lot of people.
Orphans, for instance.
We have Father and Marmee and each other.
We haven't got Father and probably won't have him for a long time.
But the men in the Army are having such a terrible winter.
I think it's right when Marmee said we shouldn't buy each other presents.
We have to make sacrifices.
I'm glad to make them.
Only I am tired of making these dresses over year after year.
At least you're the first to wear them, as you are the oldest.
Well, I don't think any of you suffer as I do.
You don't have to go to school with impertinent girls... who label your father just because he's poor.
If you mean libel, then say so, and stop talking about labels...
- as if Papa was a pickle bottle.
- I know what I mean.
And you needn't be "statirical" about it.
It's proper to use good words and improve one's "vocabilary."
"Vocabilary"?
Christopher Columbus. Aren't we elegant?
- Don't use slang words, Jo.
- And stop whistling, it's so boyish.
That's why I do it.
How I detest rude, unladylike girls.
And I hate affected, niminy-piminy chits.
Birds in their little nests agree.
Amy, you're too prim. Take care or you'll grow up to be an affected little goose.
And, Jo, now that you turn up your hair, you should realize you're a young lady.
I'm not.
If turning up my hair makes me one,
I'll wear it in two tails till I'm 90.
I won't grow up and be Miss March.
I won't wear long gowns and look like a China aster.
I'll never get over my disappointment at not being a boy. Look at me!
Dying to go and fight by Father's side, and here I am, sitting and knitting...
- like a poky old woman.
- Knitting? Bless me.
- Poor Jo.
- I don't want any pity.
Someday I intend to be a famous writer and make my fortune selling stories.
Then I shall live and behave as I please.
And you'll all ride around in fine carriages.
And you, my Beth, you'll have a new piano.
And, Meg, you will have
10 dozen dresses and satin slippers... and red-headed boys to dance with.
- I'd like that.
- There's no use fretting now.
Come, let's rehearse the play.
Beth, you play something gruesome.
Amy, I wrote a new scene for you.
It's wonderful!
- Oh, no.
- Well, it's perfectly simple.
All you have to do is shout,
"Roderigo, save me!" and faint.
"Roderigo, save me," and faint?
Oh, I can do that.
I planned my costume, too.
It's absolutely plain, with all the colors of the rainbow in it.
Impossible.
Why?
I am a princess, am I not?
Yes, you are a princess, but you don't know it.
You think you're a servant girl working for Beth. I mean Hagar, the witch.
A princess always knows she's a princess.
Well, you don't.
Look! Beth has just left the stage... with her kettle full of simmering toads.
You are locked in the tower.
Suddenly and unexpectedly,
Hugo, the villain, enters.
You cry out in horror,
"Roderigo, save me," and faint.
- Then Roderigo, Meg, enters...
- Meg, Roderigo?
I thought Meg was Don Pedro, my father.
She is, but you don't know it.
I've told you a thousand times, till the end of Act Five... you haven't the slightest idea who you are.
- Does Meg know?
- Of course I do.
Then I want to know, too.
Why should I always be so "igonorent"?
Simply because if you know who you are, the play is over.
It's too long anyway.
- Please, after all, it's my play.
- And the best we've had yet.
Jo's a regular Shakespeare.
It's nothing, really.
Now, ready?
Are you ready?
I'm Hugo.
I come in, and with wicked intentions, I say...
Then I move closer.
- Come and get your tea, girls.
- Don't we ever have coffee anymore?
Coffee is scarce and dear.
The ships are needed in the war.
There ain't no time to go to Brazil and bring back coffee for Miss Amy March.
And some folks seem to have nothing better to do... than to pry into other folks' business.
- Who is it, Hannah?
- That Laurence boy.
- What Laurence boy?
- Mr. Laurence's grandson.
I didn't know the old fusspot had a grandson.
He just came last week.
But from what I can find out, he must be a fine one.
- Why? What's he done?
- First he ran away from school.
That's the bravest thing I've ever heard of.
Couldn't trace him anywhere.
When they did find him, he was in an Army hospital, wounded.
He'd joined up under another name and lied about his age.
How perfectly splendid!
I should like to do the same.
Fine soldier you'd make.
- Jo, don't!
- It's our private property.
- I can look out of it as much as I like.
- You're every bit as bad as he is.
There he is.
Amy, Beth, stand back a little.
Well, I'm glad he's a boy.
I'd like to know a boy for a change and have a little fun.
Don't say such things.
I wonder how I could get to know him.
I wish our cat would get lost and he'd bring it back.
Then we'd get to talking.
I don't think that's very romantic.
Who said anything about romance?
Jo, you're disgracing us.
That dreadful boy. He waved back.
I'm Hugo.
You're supposed to draw back in horror.
Now cover your eyes with your hands.
Roderigo... save me!
Amy, watch me do it.
Save me!
And faint.
It's nothing, really.
Here I come again, with wicked intentions.
I'm Hugo.
Here I come with wicked intentions.
Save me!
- Glad to find you so merry, my girls.
- Marmee!
How did everything go today?
Look, we've almost finished trimming the tree.
- Have you had your supper?
- Yes. Bethy, give me another kiss, baby.
- Jo, you look tired to death.
- I'm all right.
- How's your cold, Meg?
- It's practically gone.
Marmee, I went to see Mrs. King about the position.
She's going to take me and I'm to start Monday, $4 a week.
My Meg, I'm proud of you.
They have a beautiful house and the children are sweet.
Marmee, I don't mind working at all.
Put these on, Marmee.
They're nice and warm.
- Thank you, Bethy dear.
- I'll rub them for you.
The Army's so short of blankets, we started cutting up carpets today.
I wouldn't mind sleeping under a carpet if they'd only let me do something.
I'd make a wonderful nurse, or a drummer.
Jo, get my muff. I have a surprise for you.
- Surprise for Jo?
- For all of you.
A letter from Father!
He sent you a little Christmas message.
- What's that?
- Sounds like dear old Aunt March.
Yes, it's her sleigh.
- Good evening, Aunt March.
- Not at all, miss. It's freezing cold!
You haven't shoveled a path to the door.
I might have slipped.
- Merry Christmas, Aunt March.
- So nice of you to come.
- It was nice of me to come.
- Come by the fire.
No, I have a fire at home where I should be this minute.
I only came to bring you these. Meg.
- Thank you, Aunt March.
- Jo.
Beth.
Amy. Where's Amy?
- Here I am, Aunt March.
- What are you doing back there?
I don't like this sneaking about.
Come into the open, I always say.
Thank you, Aunt March.
When I was a girl, I visited my aunts to wish them a Merry Christmas.
They didn't visit me.
- See that you spend it wisely.
- We planned to visit you tomorrow.
You never know if there will be a tomorrow.
Have you heard from your foolish father?
Waltzing away to war, leaving others to take care of his family.
It isn't preachers that will win this war, it's fighters.
We're very proud of Father, and you should be, too.
- And there's nobody looking out for us.
- Highty-tighty.
- Some tea, Auntie?
- No.
If your father had listened to me, you'd be better off today.
I begged him not to invest his money with that swindler.
One look at him, and I knew that he would take the pennies off a dead man's eyes.
That was years ago and has nothing to do with now.
- It was our money that got lost anyway.
- Don't be impertinent!
It's a waste of time to talk to you.
Nobody listens to me anyhow.
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, Aunt March.
Aunt March? You still want me to work for you, don't you?
Fine time to ask me.
I'd like to be your companion.
- A companion should be companionable.
- I will be, I promise.
- I'm willing to bury the hatchet.
- Very well, then.
Come over after the holidays.
9:00 sharp. Bring an apron.
Thank you, Auntie.
Merry Christmas, Aunt March.
Merry Christmas.
- Look, Jo, $1!
- She gave us each $1.
How splendid!
Now I can buy the Black Avenger.
- I'm longing for a bonnet with a feather!
- A box of Faber's drawing pencils for me!
- What will you do with your dollar, Bethy?
- I'll buy some new music.
May we go now, Marmee?
- All right.
- We'll have presents after all.
Think maybe I ought to close up... before somebody comes in and wants to buy something.
Merry Christmas, Mr. Grace.
Your store looks just beautiful!
- Howdy.
- We each have $1 to spend.
I would like to look at your Faber's drawing pencils.
And I'd like the Black Avenger by Lady Avington.
Is that the book you were reading the other day?
- Yes, that's it.
- You'd better get another.
You almost finished that one sitting there on that ladder.
I'm looking for a bonnet, Mr. Grace.
Velvet with a dashing feather... and a moss rose or two, and a wisp of a veiling... and an ornament about here. For $1.
You do, do you?
- Over in that there shelf.
- Thank you, Mr. Grace.
Now, what'll you have?
What's the matter, cat got your tongue?
No, sir. She's overcome with "temerdity."
She would like some music, all she can get for $1.
Over there, on that table.
I would like a dollar's worth of Faber's drawing pencils.
And wrap them, please.
And would you tie them with a red ribbon?
- A red ribbon? All right.
- Thank you.
Got your Black Avenger, Miss Josephine?
No, I finished it.
Skimmed through it while I was waiting.
- I hope you liked it.
- Oh, but I didn't. The ending was weak.
"The Duke's Bride."
If you don't like it when you're through with it, bring it back.
Thank you, I will.
- I've decided on this one.
- You have, have you?
- Here's five of them, Mr. Grace.
- Fine.
- Thank you, Mr. Grace.
- Merry Christmas.
Oh, just a minute.
Thank you, Mr. Grace.
- Merry Christmas.
- Goodnight.
"To my loving wife and children:
"Give my girls my love and a kiss.
"Tell them I think of them by day, pray for them by night...
"and find my best comfort in their affection at all times.
"I know they will remember all I said, that they will be loving children to you...
"will work diligently so that these hard times need not be wasted...
"fight their bosom enemies bravely...
"and conquer themselves so beautifully...
"that when I come back to them,
I may be fonder...
"and prouder than ever of my little women."
- Ma'am?
- Yes, Hannah?
A message from poor Mrs. Hummel.
She wants to know, can you come?
Right away.
Could you get my boots, Amy, please?
My wraps, Jo?
- Goodnight, my children.
- Goodnight, Marmee.
Don't wait up for me. I might be late.
Goodnight.
Marmee really ought to have a new pair of slippers.
I'm the man in the family while Papa's away... so I'll supply the slippers.
Beth thought of them first.
Then I'll buy her Army shoes, best to be had.
And I shall get her a nice pair of gloves, pink ones.
A little bottle of cologne from me.
She likes it. And it won't cost much.
Then maybe I can keep some of my pencils.
- But, Jo, won't the store be closed?
- We'll storm the citadel!
Has anybody seen my clothespin?
No one's taken your clothespin.
You ask that every night.
- You probably hid it under your own bed.
- It's not there. I looked.
It's Marmee. Scuttle, girls!
Christopher Columbus!
- Kidney pie and sausage!
- Popovers!
- And coffee!
- And everything!
- I don't know when I've had a popover.
- Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, Hannah!
The table looks beautiful, Hannah.
- You do beat the Dutch.
- Don't see what the fuss is about.
I remember when I served a breakfast like this every day.
We must have been enormously rich.
Tell me, Hannah. How was I dressed when we had all that money?
In diapers.
Amy, wait for Marmee.
Mom says no. You're to have your breakfast and go to church.
- She'll meet you there.
- Why? Where is she?
At the Hummels'.
Mrs. Hummel had her baby early this morning.
Another baby?
Popovers.
One baby after another.
Six children, half-frozen, huddled in one bed. No fire on the stove.
So your mom took her breakfast to them.
Not that there was enough to go around.
I believe in charity... but after all, when you cook a decent meal once in a blue moon... you like to see it enjoyed.
Besides, we don't have any to spare.
You're absolutely right, Hannah.
- What's the matter, Beth?
- I'm not hungry.
People are starving everywhere, every day.
If you let that worry you, you'll never eat at all.
I try not to think about it.
Those people are far away, and we don't know them.
But the Hummels are near, and we do know them.
You're not thinking of giving our breakfast to the Hummels?
Oh, no.
You couldn't think of a thing like that.
- I could.
- So could I.
- Either all of us do it, or none of us.
- Fine, we'll vote.
- That's fair.
- All right.
But I insist on secret voting.
I'll carry the popovers. You take the milk.
- Not at all.
- I'll carry them.
- You dropped this, madam.
- Thank you.
Come on, Josephine.
- You live next door, don't you?
- Yes, I do.
My name's Theodore Laurence.
This is John Brooke, my tutor.
How do you do?
- How do you do?
- I'm Jo March... and I'd like you to meet my sisters.
That's Meg, and the other two up the road are Beth and Amy.
How do you do?
We know all about you, you know.
About how you ran away to join the Army.
And I'd have done the same in your place.
And how you were both in the same regiment, which is splendid.
Josephine, come on, please.
Well, 'bye.
What will they think? Stopping to talk when we hadn't met them properly.
I don't care.
Anyway, you weren't very friendly.
You wouldn't even say "how do you do?"
I didn't like the way that man stared at me.
What man? Mr. Brooke? I didn't notice.
Well, I did.
He's still looking.
- Who?
- Mr. Brooke. Don't look back.
Who, me?
One for you.
And one for me. Isn't this fun?
Doesn't that taste good?
Hello! Hustle yourself and come on out and help me.
- I can't. I have the quinsy.
- What a shame!
It isn't contagious. I can have visitors.
I don't know anyone, though.
Well, you know me.
Would you care to come over and keep me company?
Marmee!
Miss March calling on Mr. Laurence.
The young one.
- Won't you come in, Miss March?
- Thank you, I will.
- Hello, Miss March.
- Hello.
- Let me take your coat.
- Thank you.
Here's some blancmange.
It's soft and will slide down easily.
Thank you.
I've come to entertain you.
I'll read aloud and you can listen.
I do love to read aloud.
I'd rather just talk, if you don't mind.
- Oh no, I love to talk, too.
- Very well.
Christopher Columbus!
What richness! This is a palace!
It's marvelous!
So roomy and so full of things.
And look at the flowers!
They're lovely. Absolutely lovely!
I call this splendor, I really do.
Theodore Laurence, you ought to be the happiest creature alive.
It just looks like a room to me.
And it certainly doesn't make me happy.
- Let's have some tea. How many lumps?
- One, please.
Three.
Well, Mr. Laurence, now do tell me all about yourself.
I know about your school and the Army, in fact, everything.
But before that, what?
- I used to live in Europe with my...
- Europe?
- I'm going to Europe.
- Really? When?
I don't know exactly.
You see, my Aunt March...
I just started working as her companion.
What a nervous, fidgety soul she is, too.
Anyway, my Aunt March has rheumatism, and the doctor thought baths.
Not that she hasn't got a bath.
She has a very nice one.
Did you have any baths while you were there?
- I mean for your rheumatism?
- I haven't got rheumatism.
Neither have I, but I figured baths wouldn't do me any harm.
That is to say, while I was there.
I've always wanted to go to Europe.
Not for the baths, of course, but for my writing.
It's so good for writers.
You see Aunt March...
But you don't know her.
What were you going to say,
Mr. Laurence?
I wasn't going to say anything.
But I'm not Mr. Laurence. I'm Laurie.
Well, Laurie.
How are you getting along with your grandfather?
Fine. Once I get used to him.
You know he's... Well, he's all right.
- Yes, I know.
- Isn't he a holy terror?
You ought to see my Aunt March.
- This looks too good to eat.
- It is. Meg made it. She's the oldest.
She is?
- Brooke and I were wondering...
- Why? I mean, why should he wonder?
He seems quite taken by your sister's beauty... and he wondered if there was anybody...
That is, anybody she liked.
- Did he ask you to find out?
- No, I just...
You may tell him we don't like anybody in our house.
That is, we like a great many people, but we don't like young men.
We like young men, too, but we don't like those... who wonder about who else we like.
Meg is too young and far too clever... to bother about who wonders about her.
It's all ridiculous!
- You're on fire!
- Fire?
Clumsy of me.
Sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you.
That's the second dress
I've scorched this week.
I like to toast myself and I get too close.
I think I'd better go home.
Please don't go home.
It's dull as tombs in here.
Is that why you stand at your window looking in at us?
It's rude of me, I know.
But you always seem to be having such a good time.
When the lamps are lit, it's like a picture... to see you all around the fire with your mother.
Where's your mother?
She died in France shortly after my father.
I'm sorry, truly.
I give you leave to look in at us whenever you like.
Only why don't you come over?
Then you'd be a part of the picture.
And Marmee is so splendid.
Grandfather might not approve.
He doesn't believe in being neighborly.
- He'd say I was imposing.
- Oh, bilge.
He looks grim, all right.
I can see how his face might frighten a lot of people.
But I can't imagine being afraid of him.
Of course, every time I've ever seen him, he's been barking at something.
Somehow, I rather like him.
Well, thank you, ma'am.
And you think my face frightens people, do you?
Yes, sir. Frankly, I do.
You understand, I don't think you mean to frighten them, but your face...
Well, you asked me, sir. Yes, I do think so.
And I bark, do I?
I've heard you bark. Yes, sir.
Perhaps you don't bark all the time, but you do bark. Yes, sir.
And with all that, you rather like me, do you?
Yes, I do.
I really do, in spite of everything.
And I like you.
- Will you have a cup of tea?
- Thank you, I had one. I was just going.
- I'll walk home with you.
- No, young man, you're staying indoors.
I will see Miss March home.
I want to pay my respects to your mother.
I'm afraid I've neglected my neighborly duties too long.
Higher, higher.
Class is dismissed.
I hope this'll teach her a lesson.
- Stuck-up thing.
- That'll teach her not to cut up didoes.
Amy March, you may close the door.
Mr. Davis, if I solemnly promise not to draw anymore on my slate... when I'm supposed to be doing sums, may I go?
- Have I your promise?
- Yes, sir.
Very well.
Give me your slate.
Oh, no.
Your slate, Miss March.
I beg of you.
Did you draw this, Miss March?
I think so.
Hand me the ruler.
Hold out your hand.
Higher.
I'm ready, Mr. Davis.
You may go, Miss March.
Oh, thank you.
- What did he do?
- What did he say?
- Did he punish you some more?
- Tell us.
He didn't say anything.
I merely told him that my mother would certainly... take me out of this miserable school when I told her how I'd been "humilated."
I told him I could not stay to discuss the matter with him... as I have to prepare for the ball I am attending tonight... which is being given in my honor by Mr. James Laurence, the millionaire.
I told him I could not stand the "deggeradation"... of being forced to attend school with a lot of ill-mannered girls... who stick their silly noses into refined, elegant people's business.
The stuck-up thing.
Oh, dear, it shows.
I don't know what you're going to do?
I'll blend it in.
I can do it with a few strokes of the brush.
Splendid. I'll stick to every chair in the place.
- I thought if I pinned this bow over it...
- A bow? There?
I'm sorry, but you'll just have to sit on it.
Sit on one patch all evening.
She could stand if she keeps her back to the wall.
- You'd better hurry, girls.
- Coming, Marmee.
How I hate to be elegant!
The dress is lovely.
Just lovely!
Thank you, Marmee, for letting me wear your lace and pearls.
They're old, but you're young and very pretty.
Thank you.
Amy, you're perfect.
Thank you.
- And Bethy.
- Isn't she the pretty one?
Do I really have to go?
There'll be all those people...
It would hurt Laurie's feelings if you stayed at home. He's been so kind.
Besides, dear Beth, you must learn not to be afraid of people.
All right.
My shoes are too tight, and I have 19 hairpins sticking in my hair... and a patch on my back, and I feel dreadful.
- Where are your gloves?
- Here, they're stained with lemonade.
- I didn't think I'd better wear them.
- You must!
You can tell a lady by her gloves.
- Not this lady.
- A lady, barehanded?
You have to have gloves.
You can't dance without them.
I can't dance and keep my back to the wall, anyway.
I'll crumple them up in my hand.
Here, at least wear one of my nice ones and carry one of your ruined ones.
All right.
Don't stretch it.
Your hands are bigger than mine.
- Well, goodnight.
- Goodnight, dear.
Goodnight, Hannah.
Don't eat too much. Wait till you're asked.
Don't be afraid.
Have you all got clean handkerchiefs?
And don't put your hands behind your back or stare.
And don't stride about or swear.
You'll disgrace me.
And don't say, "Christopher Columbus."
I'll be prim as a dish.
Let's be elegant or die!
So boyish!
That's the biggest piano I ever saw.
It's bigger than our kitchen.
- Meg's still dancing with Mr. Brooke.
- I bet she's getting dizzy.
You don't get dizzy when you look straight into your partner's eyes.
Why not?
Because you don't see anything else.
You don't see other stuff whirling by.
May I engage you for this dance?
Do say, yes.
- Thank you, no. I don't care for dancing.
- I'm enthusiastic for it.
What are you doing there, behind that palm?
There's nobody behind that palm.
- Then why aren't you dancing?
- Mother thinks I'm too young to dance.
Besides, I'd rather mingle with my sister than mingle with the crowd.
- That is, if she were here.
- She can't see anything from there.
She doesn't want to see much.
She likes to listen to the music.
Come on out and sit where you can hear it better.
What's the matter?
She has an infirmity.
She's shy.
I see.
If it weren't for that she'd be simply fastidious... for she's a real artiste and plays the piano beautifully.
She should come over here and play sometime.
She'd never do that.
She doesn't play for people. Just herself.
I wasn't going to listen to her.
It is just that that piano is going to ruin for want of use.
I was hoping somebody would come and practice on it, just to keep it in tune.
If no one cares to come, never mind.
Someone cares very much.
So you're the musical young lady.
I didn't realize that you heard what I was saying.
I heard, sir. I'm Beth.
I'll come if no one will hear me and be disturbed.
Not a soul, my dear. And you come, too.
Tell your mother that I think all her daughters are simply... fastidious.
Isn't he "perfectionary"?
This is the third polka, and I'm hanged if you refuse me again.
Please, don't ask me anymore.
- Why not? Don't you like to dance?
- I love to. Only I promised I wouldn't.
Of all the silly... Why?
Look.
Again?
I have an idea. Come along.
Come on.
There's no one in here, and we can dance to our heart's content.
Christopher Columbus, we're betrayed!
What will you girls take to keep our secret? Money or refreshments?
Thank you.
We don't really care for anything.
We had a light supper at home, because we knew the refreshments here would...
- Well, it's true.
- I am glad you changed your mind.
Come along. We'll bring them something.
Hello, Sally.
Good evening, Mrs. Gardiner.
Isn't it a beautiful party?
Laurie, my dear boy, have you met my Sally?
Of course. Many times. Excuse us, please.
Rude. Absolutely rude.
That's what comes of his running around with that Josephine March.
I suppose she's set her cap for him.
What can you expect with four girls in a family?
One of them has to marry money, since they have none.
Mr. James Laurence will have something to say about that.
I'm sure he has other ideas for the boy.
Of course, it would be a triumph for Mrs. March.
I must say, she's managing the affair very well.
- What happened? What's the matter?
- I'll take it.
I brought you a beautiful lemonade.
- I want to go home.
- What happened?
We can't tell you now. Not in front of him.
She wants to go home.
She's had a dreadful shock.
- Will you ask Meg to come?
- Of course.
But someday, when I come back,
I hope to settle down in Concord.
- Mr. Laurence promised...
- Sorry to interrupt.
Jo asked me to fetch you, Miss Meg.
I believe it's an emergency.
Will you excuse me, please?
It would only upset Marmee if we told her.
There's nothing she could do about it.
- Of all the base, false, slanderous...
- Jo, we know.
- It doesn't do any good to swear about it.
- We can keep it from Marmee.
So let's take an oath never to tell Marmee or anybody else.
That horrible Mrs. Gardiner, insulting all of us.
And before we had our refreshments.
Stop thinking of your stomach and take your oath.
- I swear.
- So do I.
And I.
I solemnly vow never to breathe a word to a living soul, until death...
- To bed, girls.
- Right away.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
Here, you take it.
Thank you.
You're going to have a lovely nose someday.
Yes, I know.
- Goodnight, dear.
- Goodnight.
You don't have any plans for us, do you?
- Plans?
- You know... like some mothers have for their daughters?
Like wanting us to marry rich men or something?
Yes, Jo, I have a great many plans.
I want you all to be beautiful, accomplished... and good.
I want you to be admired and loved... and respected.
I want you to lead pleasant and useful lives.
And I pray to the Lord to send you as little sorrow as he sees fit.
Of course, I'm ambitious for you.
Of course, I'd like to see you marry rich men, if you loved them.
I'm no different from any other mother.
But I'd rather see you as the happy wives of poor men... or even respectable old maids... than queens on thrones... without peace or self-respect.
I'm never going to get married. Never.
Aren't you, my Jo?
Go to sleep, now.
"And yet 'tis whispered...
"that when the gondolas glide through the fatal waters...
"these same waters still run crimson...
"with the blood of Lady Viella...
"and her gallant lover...
"slain by the phantom hand.
"The end."
Yes, Beth? Come in.
- What's the matter?
- My story.
Poor Jo. Isn't it any good?
It's wonderful.
Laurie's waiting downstairs for you.
Oh, bilge, I told him not to bother me.
He said he's going to wait until you come down.
Let him. I wish he'd realize
I haven't time for his nonsense.
- What's in the package?
- Slippers. I made them.
- Who for?
- A gentleman.
A gentleman?
What's the matter with everybody in this family?
This is an old gentleman.
Father? They won't let him wear those in the Army.
Father isn't old. They're for Mr. Laurence.
He's been so kind about letting me play on that lovely piano.
In all the weeks I've been going there,
I haven't even seen him.
Say, isn't this Amy's hair ribbon?
- I think she was going to throw it away.
- You think?
You're a trump.
Is your story finished? Can I read it?
Not now. But keep your fingers crossed, and maybe you'll read it in print.
- What will I tell Laurie?
- Tell him I went up in smoke.
Did you have a bad time?
Not very.
- Well, you got through quickly.
- Yes, thank goodness.
Why'd you go alone?
- Didn't want anyone to know.
- You're the oddest fellow I ever saw.
How many did you have out?
- How many what did I have out?
- Teeth, of course.
Christopher Columbus, is that what you thought?
- What is it, then?
- A secret.
I thought we weren't having secrets from each other.
- That's a girl for you.
- Oh, bilge.
- This is different.
- All right. Keep your secret.
I've got one, too.
- Something plummy?
- Something very plummy.
You tell me yours, and I'll tell you mine.
All right. Here. Read for yourself.
"Pay to Josephine March, $1." For what?
Turn it over.
"In full payment for her story entitled,
The Phantom Hand."
What do you think of that?
It isn't much, perhaps... but someday I'll get as high as $10.
I just don't understand you.
Cooping yourself up in that garret... missing a lot of fun with me, working, and for what?
- For one measly little dollar.
- It isn't the $1.
At least, that's not all of it. It's...
It'll be in print, and I wrote it.
And people will read it.
People I've never even seen.
Well, anyway,
I know where Meg's glove is.
- Is that your secret?
- Wait till you hear where it is.
Well, where is it?
In a certain pocket.
- Whose?
- Brooke's. Isn't that romantic?
No, it's horrid.
- You don't like it?
- It's ridiculous.
Of all the sickly, sentimental rubbish.
I'm disgusted. I wish you hadn't told me.
I'm glad Meg doesn't know about it.
She'd be furious.
She doesn't care about such stuff, let me tell you.
She's perfectly happy with the way things are.
You'd better tell Mr. Brooke to keep away from us... or I'll let him know what I think of him.
Trying to break up my family.
You'll feel differently when someone falls in love with you.
On a soft summer day, with the sun setting through the trees... and your lover's arms stealing around you.
I'd like to see anyone try it.
Would you?
I'll catch you!
You can't catch me!
Yes, I can!
Let me in! Open the gate! Quick.
I'd have caught you if I hadn't fallen.
You should've seen Laurie when he...
Hello, Miss Jo.
Thank you for the afternoon.
Thank you. Paying visits has never been quite so much fun before.
I hope we can do it again soon.
Goodbye, Mr. Brooke. Come along.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, Jo.
What are you mad at me for?
I've never been so embarrassed in all my life.
When are you going to stop your rude, romping ways?
Not till I'm old and stiff and need a crutch.
Don't try to make me grow up before my time.
It's hard enough having you change suddenly.
I haven't changed.
But it's time you had. Look at you!
No hairpins, no combs, running down a public road.
I wish I was a horse.
- What's the matter?
- Promise me that you'll never leave us.
Promise you'll always be our Beth.
- Beth, hurry up! It's a surprise for you.
- Come on.
Come on. Hurry, in the parlor.
Hurry.
Wait till you see.
For me?
All for you, my precious.
We haven't even opened it. Read it!
You read it. I can't.
"Miss March.
"Dear madam..."
How elegant!
"...I have had many pairs of slippers in my life...
"but I never had any that suited me so well as yours.
"I like to pay my debts...
"so I know you will allow the old gentleman...
"to send you something which once belonged to the granddaughter he lost.
"With hearty thanks and best wishes...
"I remain your grateful friend and humble servant.
"James Laurence."
"Humble servant."
Wait till I tell that to the girls at school!
Look at the cunning brackets, and the silk.
Go on, honey, try it.
Let's hear the sound of the baby piano.
I have to go and thank him.
I'll go now.
The piano's turned her head.
She never would've gone in her right mind.
I came to thank you, sir.
Miss March!
It's one of those telegraph things.
- It's Father.
- Oh, Marmee.
He's in a hospital in Washington.
I must go there at once.
He's in an Army hospital in Washington.
Marmee wants to leave on the 4:00 train.
She's packing, and she sent me to ask your help.
We need $25 for the fare.
I begged him not to go in the first place.
But nobody listens to me.
Not until they get into trouble.
Then they come.
Aunt March has a large pocketbook.
Aunt March, what's the use of all that now?
- It's 2:00, and...
- Just like your father.
Always interrupting. Refusing to listen.
But you will listen this time.
I won't.
I came here because Marmee said she's not proud to beg for Father.
Well, I am.
I'm too proud to beg for anyone.
I'd rather sweep the streets than ever come to you again!
Stubborn! Obstinate! Rude!
I wonder what can be keeping Jo.
- Here's some port wine for him.
- Thank you so much.
- Meg, will you put them in the satchel?
- Yes. Here, Amy.
- Your gloves.
- Gently.
- Don't shake them.
- There's Jo.
Where's your bad-tempered daughter?
- I thought she was with you.
- Well she's not.
You will need more than you asked for.
Oh, Auntie.
Thank you.
Are you sure you know how to get there?
You change trains at New York.
- And then...
- You need feel no concern for her, ma'am.
Mr. Brooke will accompany her on the journey.
Mr. Brooke? There's really no need.
Mr. Laurence has commissions for me in Washington.
It will give me great pleasure to be of service to you.
Thank you both.
Well, the carriage is ready.
We'll wait for you outside.
How kind you are.
It's a relief to know that Marmee has someone to take care of her.
- Thank you, Meg. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- Aren't you going to drink this?
- Thank you.
You won't forget the Hummels while I'm gone, will you?
I promise.
Somebody might remember me once in a while, too.
I hope everything turns out well, but I doubt it.
Goodbye, Auntie.
Yes, Miss. I had to get dressed and ride over here, just because you're stubborn!
Goodbye.
- Hello.
- Where've you been?
What kept you so long? I must say!
Aunt March croaked as she always does, and I lost my temper.
So I decided to get some money on my own.
Here, Marmee, this will pay for your fare.
Where did you get it?
I didn't beg, borrow, or steal it.
I only sold what belonged to me.
Your hair.
Your beautiful hair.
Oh, my Jo.
Your beautiful hair. You sold it.
I doesn't effect the fate of the nation, so don't wail.
Christopher Columbus!
What've you done to yourself?
You look like a porcupine.
Really? I feel deliciously light and cool.
Your hair will grow back, and it'll be as lovely as ever.
But you will never be more beautiful than you are now.
- I like it.
- So do I.
It's strangely becoming.
May we come to the train?
No, dear. I want you to stay here and go on with your work.
- Goodbye, my darlings.
- Goodbye, Marmee.
God bless and keep us all.
Work. I don't see why you want to work.
Money.
I've got plenty of that, if you ever need it.
And something else.
A sort of nervous feeling. I like it.
Jo, hurry!
- Don't come near me.
- What is it?
The baby's dead.
The Hummel baby died.
Oh, my poor Beth.
I tried to warm her feet, but she was so cold and lay so still.
Then I knew that she was dead.
And the doctor came, and he said it was scarlet fever.
- Come and lie down.
- Keep away from me.
You've never had it either.
I feel so funny.
How is she?
Can't anyone say? How is she?
I'd expected the fever to turn by now, but...
- She doesn't even know us any more.
- Lf Mrs. March could be sent for.
Meg wrote out a telegram days ago... and we wouldn't let her send it, and now it's...
Just think... she doesn't even know us.
Hold onto me.
Marmee will be here.
No, she won't.
How can she?
I got fidgety and sent for her yesterday.
She'll be here on the 5:00 train this morning.
Here?
- In a few hours?
- Yes.
Dear Laurie.
I didn't mean to fly at you like that... but you're such an angel... and I don't know how to thank you.
Fly at me again.
Could it be that we'll laugh again and have fun again?
I hope so.
To the railroad station.
- I shan't spare the horses.
- Bless you.
If God spares Beth...
I'll never complain again.
If life is as hard as this...
I don't know how we shall ever get through it.
- What is it?
- Dr. Barnes.
My dears...
I think the little girl's going to pull through after all.
Now keep the house quiet. Let her sleep.
When she wakes, give her some warm milk.
Get some milk.
She'll be well.
Everything will be all right.
You're home.
Don't drop her!
I made a will when you were sick.
- You made a will?
- You needn't laugh.
I left you my plaster rabbit, and my bronze inkstand.
After all, you lost the cover to it.
I left Laurie my clay model of a horse.
Even though he did say it didn't have a neck.
There.
It's so wonderful to be downstairs again.
Everything looks so beautiful.
The flowers and the sun.
Mr. Laurence sent the flowers.
I ordered the sun.
- I willed you all my clothes.
- That was sweet of you, dear.
Of course, as I didn't die, no one gets anything.
Begging your pardon, but do the Marches live here?
- They do, indeed. All of them.
- I have a package for them.
Father!
My dear.
And now, my Beth.
Now I guess the March family are all together again.
I call this splendid.
I do, really.
Where are you going?
Going?
Nowhere.
You must be expecting someone then?
- I?
- Yes, you.
- Are you expecting that man?
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Lf you mean Mr. Brooke...
- He's the only one who comes here.
I hope you don't think you're in love, because I can tell you you're not.
- I'm not?
- No, you can't be.
You see, I'm a writer.
And I write about girls who are in love, so I know.
You have none of the symptoms.
You eat all right, sleep like a log... you're not twittery, and you don't mope in corners. Therefore, you're not in love.
Therefore, don't go and marry that man.
- I don't intend to go and marry any man.
- You don't?
Hurrah for you! You're a trump.
What will you say to him when he comes begging for your hand?
Of course, he may not come around.
But if he does,
I shall say quite calmly and decidedly:
"Thank you, Mr. Brooke. You are very kind.
"But I agree with Marmee that I am too young to enter any engagement now.
"So please say no more, but let us be friends as we were."
Good. That's stiff and cool enough.
Then when you hand him the mitten, things will be the way they were here...
It's him. I'll get out of the way.
Don't forget.
If I could only see his face when you tell him.
Good afternoon.
I came to get my umbrella.
That is, I came to see how your father finds himself today.
Well, come in.
He's in the rack.
I'll get him and tell that you're here.
What's the matter, Meg?
Are you angry with me?
How could I be when you've been so kind to Marmee?
I only wish
I could find a proper way to thank you.
- Shall I tell you how?
- Please don't. I'd rather not.
Please listen to me.
I love you so.
And even if you don't love me now... maybe you could learn to.
I don't choose to learn.
Please go away and let me be.
Do you really mean that?
Yes, I do.
Won't you even think about it?
Just go away. Please go away.
What's this?
What's going on here?
He's just a friend of Father's.
I'm so surprised to see you.
That's evident. What mischief is going on?
I insist on knowing.
Who is this young man? Mr. Brooke?
- Yes, Mr. Brooke.
- The Laurence boy's tutor?
Did he dare propose to you?
Please, he'll hear you.
- Have you accepted him?
- Please.
Now let me tell you.
If you marry this hook or rook or crook... not a penny of my money goes to you.
Do you understand?
I shall marry who I please.
I don't care anything about your money.
It is your duty to marry a rich man and help your family, Miss Independence.
And you may be sure that this hook... knows that you have a rich relation, me... and that's why he wants to marry you.
How dare you say such a thing?
Why, my John would no more marry for money than I would.
Very well. Do as you please.
No one takes my advice.
Remember, the day that you marry him,
I shall disinherit you.
And now you've even made me forget what I came for.
Meg, darling.
Thank you for defending me and proving that you do care.
I didn't know how much until she said those dreadful things.
Darling, will you wait for me?
Marmee, do something.
Go downstairs, quick.
John Brooke is acting dreadfully, and Meg likes it.
"As they have given and pledged their troth...
"each to the other...
"and have declared the same by giving and receiving a ring...
"and by joining hands,
I pronounce that they are man and wife.
"In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, amen."
Excuse me.
Don't feel too badly, Jo.
You've still got me.
I'm not good for much, I know... but I'll stand by you all the days of my life.
I know you will.
You don't know what a comfort you are to me, Laurie.
- Will you listen to what I want to tell you?
- No, Laurie, don't say it.
I will and you must hear me.
It's no use. We've got to have it out, and the sooner the better for both of us.
Say what you like then. I'll listen.
I've loved you ever since I've known you.
Couldn't help it.
I tried to show you, but you wouldn't let me.
Now I'm going to make you hear and give me an answer.
I wanted to save you this, Laurie.
I never wanted you to care for me so.
I tried to keep you from it when I could...
And I only loved you more for it.
I know I'm not good enough for you, Jo... but if you love me, you can make me anything you like.
Laurie, I wouldn't change you.
You should marry a lovely, accomplished girl who adores you.
Someone who would grace your beautiful home... and give you the sort of life you really want.
I wouldn't. I loathe elegant society... and you hate my scribbling... and I can't get on without it.
I know we would quarrel.
- No, we wouldn't.
- We always have, you know... and everything would be horrid.
- Lf we were ever foolish enough to...
- Marry?
No, it wouldn't, Jo. It would be heaven.
Besides, everyone expects it.
Grandfather has his heart set on it.
So don't disappoint us.
I just can't go on without you, Jo.
Laurie, I'm so sorry.
So desperately sorry.
But I can't say I love you when I don't.
Really and truly, Jo?
Really and truly, Laurie.
I don't think I'll ever marry.
Yes, you will.
I know you will.
You'll change. You'll meet a good-for-nothing, no-account fool... and fall in love with him and work, live, and die for him.
I know you will because it's just your way.
And I'll have to stand by and see it.
I'll be hanged if I do!
- Laurie, where are you going?
- To the devil!
Are you very lonely, my Jo?
I think I must be.
You know, Jo... when you were little girls,
I used to ask myself... what would become of Meg and Beth and Amy.
I've worried about Meg's longing for wealth...
Beth's timidity...
Amy's selfish little ways... but I never worried about you.
You always seemed so sure of yourself.
But lately, I find myself thinking of you more than the others.
You often seem sad.
I'm not sad, Marmee, exactly.
I've been thinking.
I'd like to go away someplace.
Amy could take care of Aunt March, and you'll have Beth...
If I could try my wings, maybe...
If you think so, Jo, perhaps you should go.
I'd go to New York.
I've always wanted to go to New York.
Why, they have the finest libraries and theaters there.
I could take care of Mrs. Kirke's children and write in my spare time.
I'll talk it over with Father.
We'll write to Mrs. Kirke.
Might be good for you.
It would.
And Laurie would get over me while I'm gone... and when I come back, we'll be just the same as we used to be.
Of course, my darling.
You run on to bed, now. Goodnight, dear.
Goodnight, Marmee.
Make yourself at home.
I'm on the drive from morning to night... as you may suppose with such a family.
But I promise you won't get homesick... and Sophie will show you up to your room. Sophie!
Your evenings will be free. I fixed your room as comfortable as possible... with a nice table for your writing.
There are some very nice people in my house... but it's a relief to know that you'll be with the children.
Now, I must run and change my cap for tea.
This is Miss Josephine, the new governess.
Will you take her to her room?
- Thank you, Mrs. Kirke...
- Just make yourself at home, child.
I've never been in New York before.
I've been looking forward to it.
You see, I'm a writer... and I need the experience.
New impressions.
A writer should meet and study people.
Search their souls, figure out their problems.
I know I'm going to love New York.
I've always wanted to come here.
The baby!
Save the baby!
I beg your pardon. I'm so sorry.
This is Miss Josephine, who's got you in charge now.
- Hello.
- Hello.
This is Professor Bhaer.
- How do you do?
- Come on, let's finish the game.
- I want to...
- That's for Miss Josephine to say.
- I'm afraid we have frightened her already.
- No, please go on with your game.
Thank you.
- You've lost a button off your vest.
- Thank you very much. Let's go now.
- I want to be the general.
- Now you'll be the general.
No, I want...
- He's such a lovely man.
- Who is he?
I know he must have been a real gentleman at one time or another... but he's as poor as a church mouse now.
- What does he do?
- He's a professor.
See, he learns them how they talk in foreign countries.
But I don't see what good it does them when they're living right here.
And then Goldilocks did what?
And then Goldilocks saw three chairs.
One was...
A great, huge chair.
And the other was what?
A nice, comfortable, medium-sized chair.
And the third was a little-bitty chair.
That's right. What happened then?
So she sat in the big chair, and it was too hard.
I'll tell you the rest later.
Can you... wait?
Yes, Kitty, I can wait.
Goodnight.
Please don't stop.
- It's so beautiful.
- Thank you very much.
What is that song?
I've heard you play it before, and I'd like to send it to my sister.
It's called Nur wer die Sehnsucht kennt.
The words are by Goethe.
Do you understand German?
No, I don't.
Then I will try to say them for you in English.
Let's see, now.
"Only who knows what longing is...
"can know what I suffer.
"Alone and parted far...
"from joy and gladness.
"My senses fail...
"a burning fire...
"devours me."
"My senses fail...
"a burning fire devours me."
If only I could write something like that...
Something that would set other hearts on fire.
You truly like to write, then?
I love it. Writing is my life.
I've scribbled ever since I was a child.
Some of my stories have been published.
I just sold one to The Weekly Volcano.
It's a wonderful one about...
I won't tell you what it is.
But you must read it yourself.
The Weekly Volcano?
You must forgive my ignorance, but what is that?
Why, it's a magazine.
The story I just sold is the best I've done.
Since we seem to share a mutual interest... in writing and music... would you allow me to take you to the opera... or the theater... sometime?
I should love it.
Please don't think me rude... but if you're not going to sew on that button, may I do it?
I was going to, but I couldn't find a button.
You put it right there.
- See?
- Thank you.
Sit down, please.
You are very kind.
It was wonderful!
Magnificent! Just like heaven.
- Are you happy, my little friend?
- It was divine.
I don't want to be a writer anymore.
I want to sing.
Thrill millions of people with my beautiful voice!
Audiences will cheer me, throw flowers at my feet.
Bravo!
But I wouldn't make up my mind too soon.
After the art museum, you wanted to be a sculptress.
After the circus, you thought... the bareback rider was the most beautiful thing in the world.
I know, but to sing like that...
Nothing could be more wonderful.
- We will wake the house.
- I'm sorry.
There's something inside me tonight that makes me want to shout.
And what would you shout?
I'd say:
"Look at me, everybody.
"I'm Josephine March and I'm so happy."
Then... perhaps you haven't missed your home so much lately... or your old friends?
No, I haven't.
And you, and you alone, are responsible for that.
Thank you, my little friend.
You know, I have seen Martha many times before in Vienna, in Milan... but never have I enjoyed it so much.
Now I know why.
Before, I have gone alone.
Tonight I went with you.
There is no greater pleasure than to hear or see something beautiful... with someone.
- Someone who...
- Miss Josephine.
- Kitty, you should be asleep.
- I want to tell you a story.
No story. Back to bed.
Once upon a time there were three bears.
- Miss Josephine.
- Yes, Sophie.
There's company in the parlor for you.
Company? Who could it be, I wonder?
Surprise.
Are these your new stories?
They look creepier than
The Duke's Daughter.
- Can I read them, please?
- Yes, of course.
"The Place of the Coffin Tree...
"or The Secrets of a Guilty Heart...
"by Josephine March."
Amy, I've never been so surprised!
You're thin, Josephine.
- Amy, you look lovely.
- Aunt March bought me this coat.
- Do you like it?
- I love it. Sit down.
Tell me everything. Why are you here?
What kind of a place is this?
Why haven't you had supper?
Aunt March, nobody has supper till 7:00 in New York.
Tell me, now. When did you get to town?
An hour and five minutes ago, and we're in a hurry.
We have to get to the shipping office before it closes.
Shipping office?
Aunt March. Europe!
Yes, Jo, Europe.
I'm sailing tomorrow on the Britannia and I'm taking Amy with me.
Maybe you can go the next time.
Amy, I'm glad for you.
I know I promised to take you, but Amy and I get along famously.
And I never did get along with you.
It's all right, Aunt March.
I'm happy for Amy. It'll be thrilling for her.
Besides, I'm having a wonderful time... theaters, operas, lectures...
I know Amy's a much better companion than I could ever hope to be.
Tell me, how's Bethy, and Marmee, and Meg, and Father?
They're all fine, except Beth.
She's not well, Jo.
My poor Beth.
She must get well. She must.
You know that Meg is expecting?
Dreadful, isn't it?
Yes, I knew she was. I think it's wonderful.
And how's Laurie?
Didn't you see him when he was here?
He and Mr. Laurence sailed for Europe three weeks ago.
Laurie, in New York?
And he didn't come to see me?
You can't blame him after the way you trotted off... without so much as a goodbye.
Come, Amy.
We mustn't miss the shipping office.
Goodbye, Josephine.
Maybe the next time I go...
Goodbye.
I wish you were going.
I know how you've always longed to go.
No, darling. I'm perfectly contented here.
It's your reward.
You've always done sweet things to please Aunt March.
Think of all the wonderful things you're going to see:
The Turners, the Raphaels, the Leonardos...
Amy, you seem to forget that hansom cabs cost money.
That's the trouble with people who never had anything. Come easy, go easy.
- 'Bye, Josephine.
- Goodbye, Aunt March.
Goodbye, Amy.
- Write to me often.
- I will, Jo dear.
If I should see Laurie... do you want me to give him a message from you or anything?
Just tell him I love him, like a sister.
Do you really mean that, Jo?
And I wish he'd find a beautiful girl and settle down.
- Goodbye, my darling Jo.
- Goodbye, little Amy.
Have a wonderful trip.
- Yes, Professor Bhaer?
- I have read your story in The Volcano.
I'd like to talk to you about it.
Will you please come in?
Yes. Thank you.
Sit down, won't you, Miss Josephine?
I have read your stories.
- Did you like them?
- I must be honest with you.
I was disappointed.
Why do you write such artificial characters... such contrived plots?
The Duke's Vengeance, villains, murderers, fainting women...
Please. I am so sorry.
I didn't want to hurt you.
I want to help you.
What a blundering fool I am.
Don't pay any attention to me.
This has nothing to do with you.
It's just that everything happens at once.
And the rest doesn't matter so much.
I can bear that.
But Laurie...
I can never get over Laurie.
Your friend.
Something has happened to him?
Nothing happened to him, exactly.
Something's happened to me.
He came to New York, and he didn't even come to see me.
What a fool he must have been.
No, it's my fault.
Only, I thought...
What does it matter what I thought?
I've made a mess of it, as I do with everything.
But I tried. When I think of Aunt March taking Amy to Europe... when she always promised she'd take me...
Not that I begrudge Amy the trip...
I suppose that's what I am doing.
The trip to Europe you have so looked forward to.
That is a cruel disappointment.
I know.
And then, on top of it... a stupid professor comes blundering and makes things worse.
If I can't stand the truth,
I'm not worth anything.
I didn't think those stories were very good.
The Duke's Daughter paid the butcher bill... and the Kiss of The Coventries was the blessing of the Marches.
Yes, that is what I thought.
And then I said to myself,
"I maybe have no right to speak."
But then I said to myself,
"I maybe have no right not to speak...
"for you have talent."
- You really think so?
- Otherwise I would not say it.
You know that. And I say to you:
"Sweep mud in the street first, before you are false to that talent."
Say it yourself,
"I will never write one single line...
"which I have not first felt in my own heart."
Say to yourself:
"While I am young,
I will write the simple, beautiful things...
"I know and understand."
Will you do that, my little friend?
I'll try.
I'm going home.
- Home?
- It's where I belong.
They need me there. Beth is sick... and I can help my family.
But then you will not be here.
I will not see you.
Whom will I go to the opera with?
Who will sew on my buttons... when you are gone?
I may be back someday, and I'll write you. Truly, I will.
You will write, but...
Go, Josephine. Go back to your home... and write your stories as you can write them.
And maybe someday, I will see you there... in your home.
The winter's been so long.
I wish the spring would come.
You're back.
Marmee, it's so wonderful to be home.
The house has been empty without you.
My Beth.
I was wishing that spring would come, Jo, and it has.
I have so many things to tell you, very plummy, too.
And so many things to ask.
But presents first.
- This is for you, Bethy.
- Thank you, Jo.
It can accompany you while you play.
I don't play much now, Jo.
Not at all, really.
Where's Father?
In his study, dear.
He'll be so glad that you're home.
That's all, Jo.
Dr. Barnes says there's nothing we can do.
No, Father.
Not Beth.
These will be dark days for us, Jo.
For you, especially.
Now dry your eyes, my child, for her sake.
Don't let her see you cry.
Don't cry, Jo.
I don't want you to cry for me.
I'm not crying for you, darling.
I'm just lonesome for Meg and Amy... and for our old happy times.
I guess the storm didn't help things either.
I'll be all right.
It's no use, Jo.
I know.
Please don't tell Marmee, but I know.
You mustn't be afraid.
Doesn't it sound funny, me saying that to you... when you've always said it to me?
You've always reminded me of a sea gull, Jo.
Strong and wild... fond of the wind and storm... and dreaming of flying out to sea.
And Marmee said
I was the cricket on the hearth... content to stay at home.
I can't express it very well...
I guess I shouldn't even try... except to my Jo.
But it seems
I was never intended to live very long.
I never planned what I would do when I grew up... like the rest of you did... because I could never bear the thought of leaving home.
But I'm not afraid anymore, Jo.
I've learned that I won't lose you... that nothing can really part us, though it seems to.
And that we'll always be a family... even though one of us is gone.
I think that I will be homesick for you... even in Heaven.
Dedicated... to my sister...
Beth... who is now... parted from me.
If it isn't the elegant young matron?
How are the twins?
Wonderful, Jo. What's that?
My novel. Finished.
I'm sending it off.
You can read it when it comes back.
- Maybe they'll publish it.
- I'm not sending it to a publisher.
I'm sending it to Professor Bhaer.
I promised it to him once.
That's an odd thing to do.
- You write him often, don't you?
- Yes, I do.
He knows what I'm writing about.
I mean, he understands me.
Why shouldn't I write to him?
He writes me.
I think it's splendid.
We had a letter from Amy.
They're in Val Rosa now.
And she says it's paradise.
I know. She wrote me, too.
They should be on their way home soon.
I've been wondering... how would you feel if you heard... that Laurie was learning to care for someone else?
Who, Meg? Amy?
Yes, Jo.
Then I wouldn't mind at all. How could I?
I wasn't sure.
Forgive me, Jo. It's just that, you know, you seem so alone.
- I thought that if Laurie came back...
- No, it's better the way it is.
But you're right about me being alone.
I am lonely.
And who knows, maybe if Laurie had come back...
I might have said yes.
Not that I love him any differently... but because... it means more to me to be loved now than it used to.
I suppose they'll get married and live happily ever after.
I suppose they will.
- Lf you're going to the post office, I can...
- Thank you... but I'd rather walk.
- Goodbye, Jo.
- Goodbye, Meg.
Come in.
Who is it?
Laurie, my blessed boy!
When did you get back?
Where's Amy, your wife?
- Downstairs. We just got here.
- I can't wait to see her.
Jo, dear...
I want to say one thing, then we'll put it by forever.
You don't need to say it, Laurie.
It was always meant to be this way... and it would have come about anyway, if you'd only waited.
I know. You tried so hard to make me understand.
But you were so impatient and stubborn.
Now that everything came about the way you wanted it... it'll be like old times again.
No, Laurie.
The old days can never come back.
We can't be playmates any longer.
We're man and woman now... but we can be brother and sister.
And love and help each other for the rest of our lives.
Yes, Jo, for the rest of our lives.
Come on. I want to kiss your bride.
- Here, now.
- This will make you feel better.
Want a cookie?
There you are. There.
Wonderful tea. Wonderful.
Coming home on a day like this, after all the money I spent on my rheumatism.
Doctors. Baths.
Where is Jo? Where are they?
I'll never forgive myself for staying away and leaving all the burdens to you.
Oh, you're so beautiful!
And to think that only yesterday you were such a horrid little girl.
Aunt March, Mr. Laurence!
Welcome home.
Is Miss March in?
- Miss Josephine March?
- She is. Won't you come in?
Oh, no, thank you.
She has guests.
Laurie, where are you?
Come and get your tea.
Just a minute, Jo.
Will you give this to her, please?
Thank you.
You know, in Europe, one feels that dirt is so picturesque.
- Here you are, my lad.
- Thank you.
This is for you, Jo.
- Why, thank you, Laurie.
- Oh, it isn't from me.
Well, open it. Don't just look at it.
Jo, your book!
- Oh, can you believe...
- Published.
- Who left it?
- A man with sort of an accent.
- Where is he?
- He wouldn't come in. He went away.
No, he couldn't have.
Jo, come back.
- Where are you going?
- My little friend...
I came here to give you your book.
My friend published it. He has great hopes.
- He thinks...
- Never mind what he thinks.
- Did you like it?
- It has such truth, such simple beauty.
I cannot tell you what it gives me in my heart.
But you were going away without telling me.
I would never have seen you again.
Please come back.
- I couldn't intrude. You have guests.
- But they're just my family.
My sister's come home.
She's married to that boy I told you about.
Herr Laurie?
Yes, and it's the first time we've been together in a long time.
Please, Jo.
Just one moment before...
I have a wish to ask something.
Would you...
I have no courage to think that... but if I could hope that...
I know. I should not ask.
I have nothing to give but my heart, which is so full... and these empty hands.
Not empty now.
Lake George, Florida. April, 1878.
I came across this lake once, some years ago...
...in a boat that brought me home after the war with the Yankees.
Came down this river, going back into the wilderness...
...away from civilization, looking for a place to settle...
...a place to live, back into the scrub country.
It got wilder as I got deeper into the woods.
I liked it. Vegetation was denser.
The trees had to struggle for a breath of air.
Even wilder here, as I got back closer to the sources...
...to the beginning of things, further away from towns and wars.
And then I left the river, went right into the woods themselves.
And here was the scrub country.
Not many people lived here then, just a few pioneers.
I found myself a wonderful wife in a little village nearby.
Between us, out of this sea of trees, we cleared and cultivated...
...a little piece of half-fertile ground we call islands, like this one.
That was many years ago, but we still live here.
We've had our hardships and our happinesses.
This is our home.
It's called Baxter's Island.
That's my name, Penny Baxter.
Here's where we live:
Me, my wife, Ora, and our little boy, Jody.
Jody!
Jody!
Hey, coon. Them's mighty pretty little fellas you got.
Jody!
You want Jody, Ma?
Where's that boy at?
I reckon he's around somewhere.
Most likely gallivanting somewhere where it don't do nobody any good.
He's doing what's got to be done.
- I need some water!
- Well, we'll bring you some, Ma.
- When did you get back?
- Just got back now.
- Hello, Pa.
- Hello, Jody.
- Gets late mighty quick, Pa.
- That's April for you. Where you been?
To the glen.
I lay down and I was asleep.
Come, Caesar.
I aimed to follow some bees and find the bee tree.
- You find it?
- I forget to look for it, till now.
Now tell the truth and shame the devil.
Wasn't that bee tree an excuse to go rambling?
I had a notion to go rambling.
That's what I figured. I was saving to myself, There's Ma, busy in the house.
There's Jody hoeing in the corn field all by himself.
The hoe gets heavier every minute.
I bet he's thinking,
"I ought to go rambling."
- That the way you figured?
- Yes, Pa.
Ma don't hold with rambling.
Most women can't see how a man loves so to ramble.
I never let on you wasn't here.
I said, "He's around."
- Us men has got to stick together.
- Yes, Pa.
- Pa?
- Yes, boy?
I seen a sight today down at the glen.
A mammy coon with two babies.
- They was the prettiest little fellas.
- Coons is pretty.
Is it worth speaking to Ma about it?
They was so pretty, if I snare me one for a pet, even Ma would love it.
Your ma ain't gonna love no coon.
Reckon she'd get mad if I mentioned it?
What do you reckon?
- You two home at last?
- Yes, Ma!
I reckon she would.
But I wish I had me something to pet and play with.
- You said men have to stick together.
- That's right, boy.
If you was to speak to Ma about that little coon...
No, thank you.
I ain't aiming to die afore my time.
Get down to the sinkhole and bring your ma some water.
Yes, Pa.
Hey, Ma! I like you, Ma!
You get mighty loving when I got a dish in my hand.
That's when you're the prettiest.
That ain't sweet tater pone, is it?
- It is.
- It's sweet tater pone!
Pa, a big old buck watered down at the glen today. I seen his...
When was you down at the glen?
Today, Ma.
So that's it.
And me calling and calling.
You getting slick as a clay road in the rain.
- I fooled you! I got to fool you once!
- You fooled me.
- Evening, Ma.
- And you just as bad as the boy.
You both getting mighty sly.
Sit down afore the pone steams off.
Dear Lord, thanks again for the vittles. Amen.
I declare, that's a mighty skimpy blessing.
I get hungry when I go logging.
The Lord will know what I mean.
Ma? Ma, I seen a thing today.
Must I hear it or live in ignorance?
- It was only a big frog.
- A big frog?
A big frog!
Mighty interesting.
- Good night, Pa.
- Good night, boy.
- Good night, Ma.
- Good night.
Pa?
- Pa!
- What is it, boy?
Does a coon always wash everything before he eats it?
Does he, Pa?
That's right, boy. Now go to sleep.
If he washes everything before he eats...
...he must be a pretty clean animal, eh, Pa?
Coons is clean, now lie down, boy.
A coon knows how to take care of himself, don't he?
Most animals take care of themselves.
Now get to bed!
- What's this talk about coons?
- Don't know.
Did I tell you I seen a coon today, Pa?
Yes, you told me.
Now go to sleep, boy!
Did I tell you she had a couple of babies?
Yes, you told me that too.
If Ma had seen them baby coons, she'd love them.
We won't have no coons here.
What about a bear cub then?
If I should find myself one. Or a possum?
I'd love to have a baby fox or a baby panther.
But I just gotta have me a pet.
We got milk aplenty.
You think we got milk aplenty?
There ain't an extra drop.
- It could have mine!
- You're spindly enough as it is.
How can we spare rations for critters?
We can barely keep our bellies full.
I just want something all my own.
Something to follow me and be mine.
Something with dependence to it.
Well, you'll not find that nowhere.
Not in the animal world nor in the world of man.
Going on 12 and still wanting some kind of a play dolly.
Pa was doing his man's share of work at your age.
Stop pestering and get to bed afore I take a brush to you.
Yes'm.
Good night.
- Good night, Pa.
- Good night, son.
Seems like you get mighty hard on the boy at times, Ora.
Let him tend to work.
Always running off...
...wanting to bring critters back.
Well, a boy ain't a boy too long.
Leave him kick up his heels a little.
Day will come, he won't even want to.
Ora, I've seen our boy stand agaze...
...and breathless at the wonderment of bird and critter...
...wind, rain, the sun and the moon...
...just like I stood when I was a boy in the forest.
Don't be afraid to love the boy, Ora.
I'll put up the stock.
What's the matter, Pa?
Your ma's gone down to the burying ground, son.
Pa, a couple of old buck deer were in our burying grounds today.
I seen their tracks.
Ora's and David's markers were knocked down.
- Well, your ma wouldn't like that.
- I was obliged to right them.
One marker had something written on it...
...but it's getting kind of dim.
I can't make it out.
That's Ezra Jr.
He never seen the light of day.
He died when he was born?
That's right, son.
- Ma never talks about them, does she?
- No.
Are they part of Ma's raring, Pa?
- You figured that out all by yourself?
- I was just wondering.
I'm proud you're looking for the reason of things.
Figuring out what makes people rare when they don't mean it.
- Your ma's a wonderful woman, Jody.
- Yes, Pa.
When we come here, years ago, she was pretty...
...and full of the fun of life.
This place was a wilderness.
Your ma thought it were beautiful.
She pitched right in and worked as hard as I did.
We made it a kind of game, clearing this place we got.
The two of us together out here in the wilderness.
A man couldn't have had a better wife.
Then when we lost the children, one after the other.
It ain't easy for a woman to have her young'uns taken away from her.
It does something to her. Makes something inside her close up tight...
...so if it happens again, she won't let it hurt her so much.
I was lucky, weren't I, Pa?
I'm 11 years old.
I'm way past the age of dying.
What you two doing? Stop visiting.
It's time that boy got to sleep.
All right, Ma. He's going to sleep.
Pa!
Come look what's happened!
It's a calf and a shoat!
The door was broke!
- Take it easy, boy.
- But what happened, Pa? What done it?
Bear. A big one. Look there.
One toe's missing on the right front paw. Old Slewfoot!
Old Slewfoot.
But none of the dogs bayed, Pa.
None. He had the wind in his favor.
He knew what he was doing.
We got to get him.
We obliged to get it.
I'm daresome to break the news to Ma.
What happened?
What you two doing?
What's the matter with you two?
I've been calling...
- Bear?
- It's Old Slewfoot, Ma!
Old Slewfoot. That dad-ratted, no-account varmint!
Killing and not even eating what he kills!
I hate that.
Last year it was our brood sow.
- Them dogs asleep right there!
- No dog's as smart as that bear.
- They could have barked!
- We got meat to eat for a while.
Meat now and none this winter.
- You aiming to get after that bear?
- I'll get after him now.
Can I go with you this time?
Can I, Pa?
- Hunting bears is man's work.
- I can do it! I know I can.
Don't ask for mercy when it gets rough.
- Oh, no, Pa! No, Pa!
- You ain't taking him?
He's got to learn.
Jody, turn the new dog loose.
Ma, you get my gun and rations.
The wise scaper's changing his direction...
...heading for the saw grass ponds.
If that's his notion, we can slip around and surprise him.
- You sure can figure what it'll do.
- You belong to figure.
A critter's faster than us and stronger.
But a man's got more sense.
He's a sorry hunter if he can't outstudy him.
- Didn't Slewfoot kill a man once, Pa?
- So they say, boy.
Is your gun loaded, Pa?
I reckon we're getting Slewfoot pretty tired out.
You won't feel so tired when Slewfoot raise up in front of you.
Come on. Looks like that bear's got himself a ticket to Jacksonville.
Pa? You'll not be scared when we come up with him?
Not unless things go mighty wrong.
I don't reckon you'll be scared, son.
No, sir. No, Pa.
Pa, if I was to be scared, must I climb a tree?
Yes. Even if you ain't scared, it's a good place to watch the ruckus from.
Come on.
Don't go getting faintified on me.
I feared it, the thicket. They're getting close. You best wait here.
No, Pa. I ain't scared.
Just keep behind me, then.
Easy, girl. Easy.
- You reckon he's in there, Pa?
- He's in there.
All right, Julie, get him!
- He's coming, Pa! He's coming!
- No, he ain't, boy! He's going!
- Perk! Here, Perk!
- Pa, the new dog's running away!
Now, Pa!
Pa, what's the matter?!
Look out, boy!
You hurt, Pa? You hurt?
- What happened?!
- Backfired.
Julie! Rip!
Rip! Here, Rip!
Rip! Here, Rip!
This confounded worthless gun!
It's Julie, Pa!
She'll be all right, boy.
We'll make a hammock out of my coat and carry her.
There, Julie.
- Her breathing's still short.
- I reckon she's lost a mite of blood.
- Where you taking her?
- Jody's room.
I'll not pop in and out of bed all night awaking you. Good night, Ma.
Good night.
She'll live, won't she, Pa?
I'm certain she will, son.
- I'm bedding her here.
- You best sleep with me, Pa.
- I'm figuring that, if you'll have me.
- I'll have you.
Now don't you go visiting all night.
Get to sleep!
Yes, Ma.
- What makes you so wakeful, son?
- I can't stop walking.
We went a fair piece.
How you like going after bear?
- Well, I like thinking about it.
- I know.
I like the tracking and seeing the saplings broke down.
- But the fighting's right fearsome?
- It's mighty fearsome.
It's got to be. It's a hard law, but it's the law. Kill or go hungry.
I was proud the way you come along with me, son.
Thanks, Pa.
- You cold, son?
- I reckon, Pa.
Well, move over a mite.
I'll warm you.
It's get me a new gun or court trouble.
How? Where's the money coming from?
I'm aiming to trade that new dog of ours for one.
- You said he were no-account.
- He ain't much good on a bear hunt.
But you know them Forresters is fools for dogs.
Trading with them, you'd do good to still have your britches.
They're a reckless, black-hearted lot.
Lower than a doodlebug!
- Fodderwing ain't! He's my friend.
- A fine friend, crazy as a loon!
He ain't crazy, Ma.
He's just different.
Anyway, that's where we're heading.
Get that worthless dog untied, Jody.
Will you want to tote lunch?
Why, I'd not insult my neighbors that way.
- What you thinking, son?
- I ain't thinking.
Just feeling the sun, listening to the birds and looking around?
That's what I'm doing, Pa.
That's right.
You glad you're gonna see Fodderwing?
I like Fodderwing.
He can't do no harm if you don't take his talk seriously.
Fodderwing wouldn't do nobody no harm.
He ain't crazy like Ma says at all.
He ain't to blame for hatching out peculiar. He was the second setting.
We're there. I can see smoke coming out of the chimney.
Here, Perk! Here, Perk!
Come on, boy. Come.
- Is he hurt?
- Nope.
- Then why are we toting him?
- I don't want nothing to happen to him.
Well, boy, it sounds like we're here.
- You got no cause to say it was Bella!
- It was Bella.
- Don't go saving it was Bella!
- I seen him myself!
- It wasn't Bella!
- Or either Major or Sophy.
Say it's Sophy, I'll bust you!
Shut up! You're worse than the dogs!
I'll flail all of you myself!
You hear what your pa said?
Shut your mouth!
Look out, Ma, you'll hurt somebody one of these days.
Why, look there!
- Is it safe for a guy to get down?
- It's Penny Baxter!
- Get off that horse!
- What's wrong with your dog?
- Fodderwing will be glad to see you!
- Get off that horse.
Bring your horse right in.
- How's your woman, Penny?
- Ain't complaining none.
- Penny!
- Buck.
- How's your corn coming?
- Corn's good.
There's no corn-raiser like Penny Baxter.
You scapers don't know what farming is!
Ma's against the whole lot of us.
- Got me a new baby coon.
- A coon? Let's go see him.
My eagle died. He was too wild to pen.
- Won't catch nothing with wings again.
- Why?
If you had wings, what would you do?
You'd fly with them, wouldn't you?
- You'd never come down, would you?
- I reckon not.
Nothing with wings should ever come down again.
You never did try to fly again, did you?
I tried to fly too young.
That's Push. You remember him.
Hey, Push.
They won't raise no young'uns.
Lem says they's brothers.
Here's the coon.
Here, Racket.
Ain't he a thing?
If I get me another one, you can have one too.
I'd be proud to have one, but Ma won't let me keep nothing.
Oliver said he'd bring a monkey from the South Seas...
...but Ma said she had enough monkeys around as it is.
She meant Pa and me.
- Where is Oliver now?
- Sailing somewhere on the sea.
I'd never go to sea.
They ain't got no animals on the sea.
I might go to sea some day if I could go with Oliver.
Oliver's my friend.
I got three friends:
Oliver and Pa and you.
I got lots of friends.
He's eating me!
He ain't hungry, he just wants to be doing something.
- He likes you, Jody.
- I guess so.
He sleeps with me.
I sleep up there now.
Buck made it for me.
If you can stay the night, you can sleep up there with me.
You like to sleep up there?
You see things at night and hear things.
What?
All the things scared of the daytime.
I seen a deer and a wolf playing together.
You couldn't have seen that.
They's enemies.
That's what folks tell you.
And I seen the Spaniards riding on big black horses.
They's tall and dark and have shiny helmets.
There ain't no Spaniards left.
They all gone, like the Indians.
They's here.
Listen to me. The next time you go to your sinkhole...
...you know that magnolia with the dogwood around it?
Just you look behind it.
There's always a Spaniard on a big black horse...
...riding past that magnolia.
Guess we'd better go in.
Well, Jody and me set out after them dogs.
That bear took them across the scrub...
...along the ponds, through the thicket...
...right to Juniper Creek, where they caught up with him.
- Tarnation! I wish I'd been there.
- Get on with it!
- This dog go with them?
- Yes, he went along.
Do he hold the bear at bay?
No, he's sorry. The sorriest bear-dog
I ever owned or followed.
- Got himself lame?
- No, he ain't lame.
What you holding him so careful for?
Keep him out of the jaws of them bloodhounds.
- Valuable?
- Shut up, Lem!
Go on, Penny!
There he was, at the edge of Juniper
Creek, raring up on his hindlegs.
Before I shoot,
Julie gets him by the throat.
He pushes her off, and I get a chance to shoot... and what happens?
- What did happen?
- Go on!
My gun won't shoot.
Tried it again and again, but she won't shoot.
Julie's getting killed, Rip's getting slashed, this dog's no good...
...my shotgun's no good, and I'm in a pure fix.
- Quit that stopping all the time.
- Go on.
Well, just as I try the gun for the last time, she hang fires on me.
Knocks me down. That makes
Slewfoot decide he's had enough.
He swims to the other side of the creek...
...and the last we seen, he's heading for no-man-knows-where.
I'd give a gallon of whiskey to been there.
"Heading for no-man-knows-where" is right!
- That Slewfoot is something!
- You're a liar, Penny Baxter.
No man ever said that of me afore.
Just two dogs don't make a bear run.
How come you never mentioned this dog?
Now don't press me, Lem.
I done told you, the dog is worthless.
He come out in good shape.
Not a mark on him, is there?
No, there's nary a mark on him.
Takes a clever dog to fight a bear and get no scratch.
He's no good.
I wouldn't want you to get no idea of trading for him.
- You'd get fooled and cheated.
- Simmer down, Lem!
If Penny don't wanna trade, there's nothing say he got to.
Where's your manners, Lem?
Drinking all that jug.
Where's yours? Not giving company a chance to wet their whistles?
Pa, you got the most sense for such an old buzzard.
Don't take sense to crave liquor.
- Give it here.
- All right.
Pour me a noggin in the cup and you can all sit down.
If I'd known you was coming,
I'd have cooked something fitting.
This looks fine enough for the governor.
I reckon you folks give thanks, Penny.
Pa, it won't hurt you none to ask blessing once in your life.
Oh, Lord...
Oh, Lord...
...we...
We...
Oh, Lord, thou hast seen fit...
...to bless our sinning souls and...
And bellies with...
With...
With...
- With...
- Good vittles again. Amen.
- Thanks, Penny.
- Amen.
I want two things, Penny. I wanna be in at the death of Slewfoot...
...and I want that dog.
- Mind what you do, Lem.
When I want a thing, I get it.
From England. No muzzleloading, fill your own shells, easy as spitting.
Stick your shells in, breech her, cock her...
...and you're ready for anything.
Shoots as true as the eagle flies.
Now take the gun for him, or by thunder, I'll...
Well, I don't figure to get myself murdered in the tracks...
...if that's the way it stands, Lem.
You gotta promise not to beat me after you hunted him.
Shake.
You scapers got enough covers up there?
- Yes, Ma.
- Yes'm.
- Good night.
- Night.
- Night, Ma.
- Night.
And then what happened?
It were a sunny day, like this one we just had.
- You went to the roof?
- I went to the edge of the roof.
- And then you jumped?
- I jumped way out in the air.
What'd it feel like?
When I was jumping, it felt just like I were flying for a minute...
...just like a bird.
And then it went kind of dark.
It were dark for quite a time.
- Was you bad hurted?
- I reckon.
It should've worked.
I were too young. Someday, I'll fly.
I'll just fly on and on.
It'll be easier than walking.
Walking ain't easy for me since I tried to fly.
I guess near about everything would like to fly.
Birds fly. Birds and angels.
Do you know what the end of the world's like?
What?
It's empty and dark and only clouds to ride on.
But the clouds is sunny and soft.
You just float on them and go nowheres.
And all the animals has little bright clouds to ride on.
Racket'll have a little one, just alongside of mine.
And do you know what?
Sometimes, as you're drifting along...
...you drift right inside another cloud.
You'll be on that one, and we'll lie there and talk.
Just like we're talking now.
And you know what, Jody?
What?
The clouds are really just the backs of angels...
...who are flying around up there looking after things.
They'll look after you too, Jody, until you're ready to fly.
How do you know that?
I just know.
Could be.
Yeah.
Could be.
Pa! Pa! Pa!
I can see him, Pa. I can see him.
An old Spaniard riding along.
Fodderwing said I could spy him here.
That's nice.
- What'd he say he seen?
- A Spaniard.
What Spaniard?
I don't know.
There, now. I was scared this wouldn't stand another washing.
- What else you got that's cool to wear?
- Nothing, excusing my wedding dress.
- That black alpaca's nice.
- That went to pieces three years ago.
It went to pure rags, doing work just like this.
Toting washing to a sinkhole half a mile from the house...
...toting water to wash and cook in.
You'll get your well one day, right outside your door.
I'll believe it when I see it.
After all these years of waiting,
I'll take no stock in it.
Ora, I think me and Jody'll make us a trip to Volusia.
Yeah. I got some trading I wanna do.
Ain't it exciting just to see it, Pa?
Yes, once in a while, it's a pleasure to see a town.
Get along, Caesar.
It'll be nice seeing your sweetheart, won't it?
You know I got no sweetheart.
You ain't going back on Eulalie after you held hands last Christmas?
I wasn't holding hands.
It's a game they was playing.
If you say that again, Pa,
I'll just die.
All right.
Just wanted to get it straight.
Hello there, Mr. Ranger.
Hello, Mr. Ranger.
- Who's there?
- Customers.
Hi there, Penny Baxter. Hiya, Jody.
Hello, Mr. Ranger.
I was just getting set to noon.
You stay right where you are.
Sorry we woke you up.
It ain't nothing.
I can catch up with it later.
Well, look there who's in town.
Hiya, fellas. How'd that there dog I swapped you come out?
- Say that again.
- How's the sorry dog I traded you?
- We ain't laughing about it.
- You ain't mad, Buck?
I ain't saving.
You keep out of Lem's way.
Lem in town with you?
Yes, but he's courting
Twink Weatherby.
She's Oliver's girl.
Just don't let Lem hear you say that, young'un.
I'm sorry Lem feels that way about the trade.
You just told him the truth.
My words was straight...
...but my intentions was as crooked as the Ocklawaha River.
The steamboat captain's been asking about you.
Says these city folks traveling the river's hollering for venison.
- What's next?
- Two boxes, 12-gauge brass shell cases.
Two boxes, 12-gauge brass shell cases.
Just hollering for it, he says, and it ain't half as good as pork.
- You and me, we know it. What's next?
- One pain curer.
One pain curer.
Yes, sir, as I says to my nephew,
"Oliver, you're just as well..."
- Oliver in town?
- Oliver! Oliver back?
- Where'd he go to this long time?
- He says he traveled the seven seas.
You reckon he saw whales this time?
Where is Oliver?
The sailor? He's out with his gal,
Twink Weatherby.
But Millwheel said she's Lem's girl.
Don't you bother your head about that.
That completes it. You figure that up.
With the cash left over, I'll buy some tobacco seed for the spring money crop.
With that money, I'll buy brick and mortar for a well outside our door.
- What do you think, Mr. Boyles?
- That'll be fine for Mrs. Baxter.
- What's this stuff? Black alpaca?
- Yeah, that's what it is.
That's what I thought.
I think I sold Mrs. Baxter a dress length of that alpaca...
...about four or five summers back.
That's pretty.
Young man, you don't come in to trade very often...
...so I'll treat you to a dime's worth of anything you've a notion for.
I reckon that mouth organ's worth more than a dime.
Well, yes, but it's been here a long while.
Take it and welcome.
- Well, now. That's unusual kind.
- Thank you, sir.
- There's your gal now, Jody.
- Pa.
It's Eulalie.
Come out special just to see you.
- Pa.
- Now go say "How do" to her. Go on.
- Your boy's got manners, Mr. Baxter.
- He's right smart of a comfort.
- He hit me with a potato!
- Jody, you put that down.
What's got into you?
How come you shame me like that?
Now you go up and excuse yourself.
Jody!
Right smart lot of spunk your boy's got, Mr. Baxter.
Thank you, Mr. Boyles.
We'll be back later for our things.
Quick! They're killing Oliver. He's fighting Lem and all the Forresters.
They're killing him.
Is Twink Lem's or Oliver's girl?
- They can't decide.
- Who do we fight for?
- Whoever's taking a licking: Oliver.
- But the Forresters are friends too.
- Who's judging this fight?
- We are!
If it takes three men to whip one, the one man's the best.
Hello, Oliver. Welcome home.
Oliver!
Am I glad to see you, you old landlubber, you.
I brought you a gift from China.
I saw a lot of whales too.
I'll smash you like a skeeter if you get in my way.
We'd have fought him one at a time.
I'll fight any man saving that about my gal.
And I'll say it again.
Keep off him!
I ain't seen a fight this good for months.
- Reckon I'll get in it too. Coming?
- Might as well.
Hit him again!
Jody! Get out of this!
Get off, you little...!
I'm back, Ma.
What happened to you?
- We got in a fight.
- Who did?
Me, Pa, the Forresters and Oliver.
They was beating him bad.
They couldn't decide if Oliver's girl...
Now, ain't that just fine!
Where's your pa?
I'm here.
Well, ain't that just fine!
Now, did I make a good trade?
That makes near $5.00 we got saved.
You know what that money's going for?
Tobacco seed.
Enough seed to have a fine money crop next spring.
The money we get from that is going into bricks and mortar...
...so's you can have your new well, right outside your door.
Well, I declare.
I just can't imagine it.
Washing right on my own place!
Having all the water
I need right here.
Not even caring if some slops over now and then.
Being able to waste a whole bucket of nice cold water...
...just to cool myself with.
I declare it'll be such a blessing, it won't seem natural.
I bet you ain't bought half my order.
I never knowed a man vet who could be trusted to...
Where's my paregoric? Where's my...?
That's just like a man!
Throwing away money on such as this.
Men got no more sense than...
How much did this cost?
Tell me how much you wasted on such foolishness.
The next time you go to Volusia,
I'll... How much was this?
She's raring, Pa. Don't she like it?
She likes it, boy.
Giddap.
Fodderwing claims he can talk to vultures.
They wouldn't have much
I'd wanna hear.
Maybe if you was to tame one, it might make a pretty nice pet.
Whoa, Caesar. Whoa.
Well, Ma, been admiring our fine crop of corn?
I ain't admiring nothing.
Know why the hogs didn't come in?
- Why?
- They was stole.
- Stole?
- They was baited. Look here.
I was by the sinkhole. I seen this corn and hog tracks beside it.
- They come and took them.
- Who have, Ma?
That ain't hard to guess.
Them fine friends of yours.
- The Forresters?
- Them black-hearted, thieving...
Jody, fetch me my gun.
Look, Pa!
So that's what they done.
They trapped them.
They had a cart, Pa.
And that track leads plain as anything right to the Forresters.
Dogged if I can understand cold out meanness.
Well, boy, we're obliged to follow.
Lem said he'd shoot if we come around.
I'd rather let them keep the hogs.
And go without meat?
How will we live if we don't protect our rations? You wanna beg off going?
- I reckon not. I reckon to go with you.
- All right then.
There's trouble waiting, you just as good go to meet it.
- Pa!
- Get back! Watch the dogs!
Pa!
He got me, boy.
He was a big one.
Get the gun.
Pa, it's a doe.
Do as I say.
Use your knife to open up her belly.
What am I to do?
Cut out the liver and heart.
Maybe we got a chance this way. Hurry.
Hurry, boy!
- You'll bleed to death.
- I'd rather that than swell.
I seen a man die. I can feel it draw.
Do it hurt, Pa?
Like a hot knife.
Give me the heart, boy.
- The doe's got a fawn.
- Sorry, boy, I can't help it.
Listen, I got to make for home.
You get on to the Forresters.
Have them get Doc Wilson.
- It's my only chance. Can you do it?
- I can.
- Save I'm snake-bit afore they shoot.
- I can do it.
Keep out of Lem's way.
Have one of them pick me up in case
I can't make it. And hurry, boy!
You'll make it! You hear me?
You're obliged to make it.
Fodderwing!
Fodderwing!
- Fodderwing!
- What do you want? You little varmint.
- Pa's snake-bit.
- What kind of snake?
- A big rattler.
- Where'd it get him?
- In the arm.
- Is he swelling?
It's bad swelled already.
Please ride for Doc Wilson.
Please ride for him, quick. Please!
- I'll ride for him.
- I thank you, Millwheel.
I'd help a dog was snake-bit.
I'll pick up Penny.
Walking's bad for a man is snake-bit.
Pa! Oh, Pa!
Old Death's got to wait a while on me.
Doc. Hey, doc.
- What?
- Look at Pa.
Lord of the jaybirds, he made it.
- He's dead!
- Not by a long shot.
He's pulled through.
You sound like you're sorry.
- I could sleep for a week.
- That's just what I want you to do.
He ain't pretty, but by thunder, he's alive.
I woke up fixing to bury him.
- How he done it without whiskey?
- How come you be out of it?
I was finishing my last jug when you rode up.
How was I to know somebody was to get snake-bit? Thank you, ma'am.
Jody, you finished?
Take this warm milk into your pa.
And mind you don't spill none of it.
Now did I have me a real good snort,
I'd be pretty nigh satisfied.
It were a near thing, Pa.
- You all right now, though.
- That's right.
I'm proud, the way you kept your head and done what was needed.
What's the matter, boy?
- Pa, you recollect that doe you shot?
- Can't never forget her.
Most likely she saved your life?
She saved me, that's certain.
Pa, you recollect that little fawn she had?
Yes, boy.
Most likely it's mighty scared and lonesome and hungry.
I reckon so.
It might be out there, not knowing which way to go.
Might be.
It won't take much to raise it.
It'll soon make out on leaves and acorns.
You figure the farthest of any young'un I ever knowed.
We've taken its mammy and it weren't to blame.
It don't seem grateful to let it starve, do it?
Pa, you figure I could go out and see could I find him?
- And tote it here?
- Tote it here and raise it.
Pa?
Boy, you've got me hemmed in.
You tell your ma I said you was to go and get it.
Hey, Pa!
Hey, doves!
It's me.
It's me...
...Jody!
Well...
I'm proud you found him.
He weren't scared of me.
He was laving right where his mammy made his bed.
Look, Ma! I found him.
So I see.
It'll take milk for a long while.
I don't know as I'd have consented if I'd knowed it was so young.
He ain't so young.
Is he, Pa?
Ora...
...I got one thing to say, then I'll have no more talk about it.
The little fawn's as welcome in this house as Jody. It's hissen.
And we'll raise it without grudgement of milk or meal.
You've got me to answer to,
I ever hear you quarreling about it.
This is Jody's fawn just like Julie's my dog.
I only said it was young.
All right, so it is.
Now, don't you bother about him at all.
I'll tend to everything that needs tending to.
He won't be a mite of trouble to you.
I fooled you.
Hey! Wait for me.
Come on!
Come on!
Come on, I'll race you.
Hey, Ma!
You wanna see him butt?
Look it, Ma!
- Did you see him, Ma?
- I seen him.
Look at him thisaway, Ma.
Ain't his eves pretty?
They can see mischief too far.
- Ain't he got a cute, foolish tail?
- All deer's tails look the same.
- You wanna pet him? You can.
- I ain't petting no fawns.
I gotta get a name for him.
I've studied and I can't think of one good enough for him.
You think more of that fawn than of your pa.
Oh, Pa!
But I just got to.
I gotta get something special.
- Why don't you call him Rover?
- Ma! Rover's a dog's name.
Well, call him Joe, then.
Ma! Joe Baxter sounds like a man.
He's gotta get him a special name.
- You know who'd get me a good name?
- Who's that?
- Fodderwing.
- Fodderwing's ailing.
But he'd just love to see my little fawn. And he gets wonderful names.
He'll get you a name.
He's got an ear for such things.
Can I, Ma? Can I?
All I know is, my voice don't mean nothing around here.
Ma!
Jody!
What?
You gotta quit sleeping with that fawn.
Just don't you be impatient now.
You think you're baggily...
...because you can get into bed without having to undress.
Get over.
I wanna explain something to you.
Pretty soon, we'll go see Fodderwing, he'll give you a name.
You'll like Fodderwing.
I want you to behave real mannerly, so as he'll take to you.
You and me and...
You hear that?
That's a wolf.
You ever hear a noise like that, you get in the house quick.
You hear any noises that is animals...
...you start running and bleating so as I'll hear you.
You listening to me?
I don't know what ails Ma.
You smell just fine.
Come on.
This here's where Fodderwing lives.
Stand still.
You gotta look nice if you want him to put a name to you.
Fodderwing always shows me his pets.
Now I've got something to show him.
Come on!
Fodderwing.
Maybe they's all asleep.
Fodderwing! It's Jody!
I got me something.
Come to see Fodderwing.
Come to show him my fawn.
I come special!
He's dead!
- But I come to see him.
- You come too late.
I'd have fetched you if there'd been time.
There wasn't time enough to fetch old doc.
One minute he was breathing, and the next minute, he just wasn't.
Like as if you'd blowed out a candle.
You can come look at him.
I lost my boy.
My poor crookedy boy.
He'll not hear, but speak to him.
Hey.
I knowed you'd hate it fearful.
I wished he could've seen your fawn.
I told him about it.
He talked a lot about it.
He said, "Jody's got him a brother."
That's how come we to be here.
I come for Fodderwing to name him.
He did name him. He said,
"A fawn has a little white flag.
His tail is a little white flag.
If I had a fawn, I'd name him Flag."
He said, "Flag the fawn is what I'd call him."
Flag.
Flag the fawn.
Penny, you've had a Christian raising.
We'd be proud, did you say something.
Oh, Lord, almighty God...
...it ain't for us ignorant mortals to say what's right and what's wrong.
Was any one of us to be doing it...
...we'd not have made this poor boy into a cripple.
But, Lord, in a way of speaking, you made it up to him.
You give him a way with the wild critters.
You give him a sort of wisdom.
Made him knowing and gentle.
And now you've seen fit to take him...
...where being crookedly in mind or limb don't matter.
But, Lord, it pleasures us to think now you've straightened out them legs.
It pleasures us to think on him walking around as easy as anyone.
And Lord, give him a few redbirds...
...and maybe a squirrel or a coon to keep him company, like he had here.
All of us is somehow lonesome...
...and we know he'll not be lonesome, do he have wild things around him.
If it ain't asking too much, put a few varmints in heaven.
Thy will be done.
Amen.
What's all this?
- You can't leave them in this storm.
- They'd get blowed off the place.
You keep them out of my way.
Why didn't you let in the cow and
Caesar and have everything to suit you?
Maybe we could let in Old Slewfoot.
Pa, when we gonna hunt
Old Slewfoot again?
Jody, you're wet to the skin.
I got to dry Flag.
Look how good he shines up.
Get out of them wet clothes.
Ain't it nice hearing the wind and rain, and us in here safe and cozy?
That's right, son.
Maybe we can tell a few tales tonight.
How'd you like that?
- Hey, Pa.
- Maybe your ma'll tell us a tale.
- Eh, Ma?
- I might.
Hey, Ma!
Well, Uncle Miles looked at them two bear cubs and he says:
"I'm gonna catch me one of them."
So he did.
But he didn't have nothing to tote it in.
Being from Georgia, he had on long underdrawers.
He took them off, tied knots in the legs and made a sack.
He put the cub in it, and as he's reaching for his britches...
...here comes a-crashing.
And that she-bear come out of the thicket, right at him.
- Jody-boy, fetch me my pipe, son.
- Oh, Pa!
- What you grinning at?
- Oh, nothing.
I look all right?
You look just dandy, sweetheart.
Thank you, boy.
He takened out through the swamp and dropped the cub.
And the old mammy gathered it up, drawers and all.
She was so close, she stepped on a vine...
...and it tripped him and throwed him in the brambles.
Now, Aunt Moll was kind of muddle-minded.
She never could make out how he come home without drawers...
...and his bottom scratched.
Uncle Miles said:
"That weren't nothing to the puzzling of that mammy bear...
...over them drawers on her cub."
Oh, Pa, you got all them tales in your mind and don't tell them.
I ain't much for dogs, but there was a dog once I takened a notion to.
She had the prettiest coat.
I said to the owner,
"When she finds pups, I'd like one."
He says, "But you ain't got no way of hunting."
I wasn't vet married to your pa.
"A hound'll die," he says,
"if it ain't hunted."
"Is she a hound?" says I.
He said, "Yes'm."
I said, "Then I sure don't want one, for a hound'll suck eggs."
Well...
Well, now, that's a mighty exciting tale.
You got any more like that one?
I might.
You reckon it's fixing to do damage?
Rotted!
Most of them rotted!
Our whole crop!
Keep turning them so's they all get a mite of heat.
Most of these beans is molded.
Six days of rain. We just as good to quit fighting and lay down and die.
Well, Job takened worse punishment.
That's right, find the good in it!
Get out of that, you dad-ratted varmint!
Ma! Ma! Don't hit him again.
That ends it.
That critter gives me no peace.
He can't come in this house, never.
He's just hungry, Ma.
He ain't had much.
- Lock him up in the barn. If he...
- Leave off, the both of you.
Ain't it enough to have trouble pouring on us out of the skies?
Has a man got to die to find peace?
What's happening now?
Seems like...
Pa, it's stopped!
Ma, it seems like times a body gets struck down so low...
...ain't a power on earth can ever bring him up again.
Seems something inside him dies...
...so he don't even want to get up again...
...but he does.
They ain't much of a world left for us, but it's all we got.
Let's be thankful we got any world at all.
Here comes the sun.
Hey, Ma, look at this day!
If I was dead,
I'd notice a day like this.
Just right for corn.
Just right for okra. For tobacco...
...cowpeas, potatoes, greens.
Hey, Ma, we got us a planting Pa, ain't we?
To hear him, you'd think he'd plant the world.
I'd purely love to.
Come on. If we're gonna do that planting, we best keep busy.
When these tobacco plants come up, we won't have to tote water no more.
Ma's gonna have a well, right outside our door.
Pa give us a lot of chores today.
There. Now we're all done.
Come on. You sit in the doorway.
Hey, Pa.
- Was that Jody?
- What if it was?
Now stand still.
You'll bust one of these seams.
Stand still, I tell you.
You want I should spoil it?
- I done the hoeing you told me to do.
- All right, all right.
- And I got the tobacco plants watered.
- That's good, boy.
Anything else I should do, Pa?
I guess not.
That's sure mighty pretty, Pa.
I'll pretty you with a piece of fat wood! Get out of here!
Can I bring Flag to see how pretty it looks?
- You gonna get...
- Be still!
You said you'd be through by now!
- He's gotta learn how dresses is made.
- Not on me, he don't.
Besides, I'm getting feverish.
Well, fight it a minute and turn around.
How do you think I'll finish in time for the wedding?
What wedding?
Who's getting married?
- Oliver's getting married.
- Oliver?
That ain't the worst of it.
They're going to Boston to live.
- We ain't gonna see Oliver no more?
- I'm afraid not, boy.
Now, tomorrow, I'm going to Oliver's wedding.
After they're married, they're going off to Boston...
...so we'll be kind of alone.
Take care of yourself while I'm away.
Be good.
You understand?
I been doing some figuring.
You're getting kind of big.
Now I don't care for girls, and I don't never aim to get married.
But when you get a little bigger, maybe you're gonna want a doe.
So someday I'm fixing to build a house by the glen.
And I'm gonna get you a doe.
We're all gonna live there together by the glen.
Do you like that?
Me living with you?
See, I'm gonna take care of you fine.
Now, good night.
It's right nice seeing a lot of people again, and the buildings and stores.
My, how it's growed! That there house never used to be there.
- It's been built a year.
- Ma don't get out enough.
- That's the truth.
- How do you do?
- Why, how do, Miss Saunders?
- How do, Miss Saunders?
- She won't recollect me.
- How do you do, Miss Baxter?
How do you do?
Well, I declare!
Well, best get going.
Bye, Penny.
- Jody and me'll miss you.
- Miss me enough to visit.
I'll visit you, Oliver.
Thanks for sticking by me. I won't forget you. Not even in the China Sea.
Bye, Eulalie. Be a good girl and maybe you'll look after Jody for me.
- Bye, Miss Baxter.
- Bye.
Goodbye, Jody.
Shall I kiss you goodbye, Jody?
Well, I guess it wouldn't hurt nothing.
- Come on.
- You'll miss the boat!
Hey, come on, honey.
We'll miss the boat.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Bye, Oliver. Bye, Twink.
I don't like folks going away.
It's like they was dying.
The way Fodderwing done.
That's life, boy.
Getting and losing.
Losing and getting.
I'm glad I got Flag.
Flag. Stop that. Oh, Flag.
You'll knock this milk over.
He missed me, Pa.
Flag sure missed me yesterday!
He just tags after me like a dog.
Just like your old...
What's happened, Pa?
We been saving a long time to get enough to set out them tobacco seeds.
It weren't Flag done it. Weren't Flag.
It were Flag.
It won't do no good.
He ruined half the crop.
But Flag didn't mean it, Pa.
Ma, listen, Flag didn't mean it.
Ma, listen. Ma!
She figured at last she'd get a well.
That's why she's quiet.
- Flag didn't mean it.
- I don't figure he done it malicious.
He were just racing back and forth, and it were something to jump on.
What you looking at him that way for?
He's a yearling now, for sure.
- You think a heap of him, don't you?
- Why, sure.
Yes, you're a pair of yearlings now.
It grieves me.
What you do that for?
You're a yearling now.
You're growed up.
You gotta be good.
- I can do that, Pa. I know just how.
- No, we'll do it together, boy.
There's a good few he ain't touched.
Think we got enough for Ma's well?
No, I'm afraid not, boy.
But I got a little idea.
Let's clear the field behind the pot garden.
There's a few stumps there. If we can get them out, we might plant cotton.
Pa!
A money crop, so your ma can still get her well.
Hey, Pa! We can do it! We can do it!
Giddap, Caesar. Go on. Giddap.
This is the last one, Pa. Where do you figure we best dig Ma her well?
We best get this field in cotton before we figure on that.
Now, giddap, Caesar. Go on.
Giddap now!
What's the matter, Pa?
It's all right.
I'll be all right in a minute.
- I reckon I strained myself.
- I'll get Ma.
No!
I'll be all right.
Unhitch Caesar. I'll ride him in.
You don't never know when to quit.
If you had a mite of sense...
- You likely ruptured yourself.
- Please to hush, Ora.
Is it easier, Pa?
Feels mighty good, laving down this way. Hardly feel it.
You're obliged to take it easy.
I reckon.
If it happens that I ain't out of bed for a few days...
...you think you can take charge?
- I can take charge.
- Know what is to be done?
Cowpeas need hoeing.
I best watch for worms. And...
You know as good as I, you got to keep that yearling out of the fields.
- I'll keep him out, Pa.
- That's fine.
You keep him out, religious.
Yes, sir.
I'll just take charge of everything.
You best get to bed, now.
You got a lot to do tomorrow.
You get a good sleep too, Pa.
Got to get your strength back.
All right, son.
Night, Pa.
Good night, son.
Your pa asleep?
He's getting to sleep.
You best get to bed too, Ma.
What's that?
I said, you best get to bed.
Mr. Impudent Bigmouth, you just get to your room.
Yes, ma'am.
- Some people getting mighty important.
- Yes'm.
- Night.
- Night.
Look. These here's for your supper.
I only wasted two shots.
That's mighty fine.
I'm taking charge all right.
Everything's coming along fine.
Why, the corn is the best
I ever seen and...
What's the matter, Pa?
- When did you see the corn last?
- Yesterday. It's near an inch high.
Your ma here says...
She says something has ate it.
Ate the corn?
She says nearly the whole crop is gone.
But that ain't right.
Yesterday it was all right.
It appears like something must have ate it during the night.
- Flag ain't ate it.
- He did.
He wouldn't eat the corn!
He never ate nothing he shouldn't.
Go and see!
And that settles it!
That deer has got to go!
It were Flag.
I reckon. Yes, sir.
But he won't never do it again, Pa.
I'll whip him with a stick, Pa.
- He ain't been whipped.
- You don't think whipping will help?
I'll pen him up...
We got no place to pen up a wild thing like that.
I'll halter him. I'll tie him and let him kick...
Now, wait a minute, boy.
Just listen to me.
Yes, Pa. I'm listening.
What's happened is powerful bad.
You know that.
- Yes.
- But your ma and me have an agreement.
We're going to have a try at a remedy.
- You'll work extra hard to fix things?
- Oh, Pa, I'll do anything.
- I'll work like you never seen!
- All right, all right.
First, you get whatever corn we got left.
Then you plant it like we done before.
Then you build our fence up high.
When it's higher than you can reach,
I hope I can help you.
But you got to get it all up before the corn starts showing again.
Maybe that way we're safe.
- You understand, boy?
- You can depend on me, Pa.
Soon as I get the corn planted, you'll stay in the barn till the fence is up.
Jody.
I'm proud to see you working so hard, boy.
But the yearling ain't worth killing yourself over.
I ain't killing myself, Pa.
I ain't killing myself.
I'd give a year of my life to help you with this.
I can do it all right, Pa.
I can do it.
We done it, Ma! We done it!
Hey, Ma!
- Never mind squeezing my life out.
- I sure thank you for helping me, Ma.
I never figured you had it in you to work this way.
Looks as if we're gonna have a crop after all.
And a fence, Ma!
Ain't it wonderful!
Let's go in and tell your pa we're done. He'll be mighty proud.
Jody.
Come here, close to me.
You know we depend on our crops to live, don't we?
Yes, sir.
- We can't go on having them destroyed.
- No, sir.
There is no way in the world to keep that yearling from destroying them.
I'm sorry. I can't never tell you how sorry.
But all's been done was possible.
Take the yearling out in the woods and tie him and shoot him.
Pa...
Pa...
You gotta go away, Flag.
You gotta go away and never come back.
You're growed up now. You gotta go out and find yourself a doe.
We can't all live together like I planned.
You've been bad, without meaning to be.
You can make out by yourself, can't you?
You'll be all right. You're smart.
Besides, I don't care for you no more.
You ain't cute like you used to be when you was little.
You go now. Ain't nobody got any use for you around here anymore!
Go on, you hear me? You go!
There's nothing I can do to save you!
Go on! You gonna get killed if you stay around here!
Get out before I shoot you!
And don't you never come back!
Don't you never!
How come you not to do what I told you?
I couldn't.
I just couldn't, Pa.
Tell your ma to come here.
Go to your room and shut the door.
Yes, sir.
Pa says you're to go to him.
I didn't mean to hurt the critter.
I can't shoot straight.
Flag!
Jody!
You got to finish him, boy.
You got to put him out of his torment!
You done it on purpose.
You always hated him!
You went back on me!
You told her to do it!
I hate you! I hope you die!
I hope I never see you again!
It's me, Flag.
It's me, Jody.
Jody!
Jody!
Flag.
Flag.
Ma! I'm hungry, Ma.
I'm hungry.
Look sharp there.
Something ahead. What is it?
Reverse engine. Lower the aft boat.
- What's he doing on the river?
- Skinny, ain't he?
- Try him something to eat.
- He ain't awake.
I'll get him some soup.
Pa!
- Pa!
- Take it easy, kid.
- He's feverish, ain't he?
- He's waking up.
Well, young'un, what's the matter?
We about run you down in the dark.
You hungry, boy?
Hungry?
Hey there!
Not too fast.
Ora?
It's me.
It's Jody.
Jody.
Come close.
Boy, we near about give you out.
You all right?
You all right. You ain't dead nor gone. You all right.
Glory be!
- I had to come home.
- Why, sure you did.
I ain't meant what I said about hating you.
Why, sure you ain't.
When I was a child,
I spake as a child.
- Where's Ma?
- She drove the wagon to Doc Wilson's.
Your ma's been searching for you.
She ain't done nothing else.
She'll be mighty glad you're home.
Jody, I'd be proud to know where you been.
I been on the river.
I aimed to go to Boston.
I see.
Were you hungry?
I didn't get nothing to eat for three days.
I'm sorry you had to learn it that way.
Now you know Old Starvation. He's got a face meaner than Old Slewfoot.
It's fearful!
Sit, boy.
You figured I went back on you.
That's why you runned away.
Son, there's a thing every man's got to know. Maybe you know it already.
It wasn't only me. Wasn't only your yearling deer having to be destroyed.
- Boy, life goes back on you.
- Yes, sir. I reckon.
You've seen how things go in the world of men.
Every man wants life to be a fine thing and easy.
Well, it is fine, son, powerful fine.
But it ain't easy.
I wanted life to be easy for you.
Easier than it was for me.
A man's heart aches seeing his young'uns face the world.
Knowing they got to get their insides tore out the way his was tore.
I wanted to spare you as long as I could.
I wanted you to be with your yearling.
I knowed the lonesomeness be easier.
But every man's lonesome.
Well, what's he to do then? What's he to do when he gets knocked down?
Why, take it for his share and go on.
I'm ashamed I run off.
You're near enough growed to do your choosing, Jody.
Maybe you'd crave to go to sea like Oliver.
But I'd be proud did you choose to live here and farm the clearing.
I'd be proud to see the day you got a well dug.
So's no woman here'd be obliged to do her washing on a seepage hillside.
You willing?
I'm willing.
Shake.
It's food and drink to have you home, boy.
Go to bed and rest.
I'll sit and wait for your ma.
Yes, sir.
- Night.
- Night, Pa.
- I'll start the corn in the morning.
- Yes, boy.
- We'll make it, Pa. We'll make out.
- Yes, boy.
- Come spring, we'll hunt Old Slewfoot.
- Yes, boy.
- Good night, Pa.
- Good night, my son.
- He's done come back, Ezry.
- He's done come back different.
He's takened a punishment.
He ain't a yearling no longer.
Ezry...
...I thought I'd lost them all.
Ora...
Ora, he's done come home.
I'll go in and see him.
Go on, Ma.
- Hello, Ma.
- Hello, son.
- You home and safe.
- Yes, Ma.
I'm grateful.
Now you get to sleep.
- Night, son.
- Night, Ma.

This is a very old fairy tale that was first told many centuries ago and still lives, and everybody tells it in a different way.
People of the Fairy Kingdom, hey, people of the Fairy Kingdom!
The Royal Herald is speaking to you
Can you hear me?
O, what a pleasing message have I to deliver to you!
Everything is prepared for the ball in the Royal Palace.
Dear invitees to the ball, o, dear invitees to the ball!
Do not forget that you are invited!
Something miraculous will certainly happen at the ball.
It is not without a reason that our land is called the Fairy Kingdom.
Do come, do not forget, on my word of honour, you won’t regret it.
The King got up at 5 in the morning he personally dusted the grand staircase,
Then he paid a visit to the kitchen, had a row with the chef, enraged, he relinquished the Crown, but after all tempered justice with mercy and now he is running along the Royal road checking that everything is fine.
There! Can you see him?
- Good day, Mr Forester.
- Good day, Your Majesty.
Forester, I wanted to ask you, why do you shiver and look back all the time in these latter days?
Maybe, there is a monster in the forest, threatening you by mortal danger?
No, Your Majesty, I would kill the monster!
Maybe thieves came to the forest?
Nothing of the sort, Your Majesty! I would fight them off at once!
Maybe an evil wizard haunts you?
No, Your Majesty, I would sort that out!
What drove you to such a condition then?
My wife.
- Really?
Upon my soul, I married a cute woman, but she is harsh.
They twist me round their little fingers!
I mean my spouse and her daughters from her first marriage.
They’ve been getting dressed for the Ball for last three days they have trotted us off our death!
I mean me and my little daughter, who became a stepdaughter because of my weakness...
I am resigning, I will cloister! if such heartrending things can happen in my kingdom!
Live your life on your own!
Shame on you, Forester.
Hush, hush, Sire, if my wife hears you I am dead!
Don’t put the blame on me! My wife is a very special woman.
Her sister, who was very the same as she is, was eaten by an ogre. He got poisoned and died!
You see what a poisonous temperament has this family, but you are angry with me...
Well, let it be so, I am staying on the throne, give me my crown.
Forget it, Forester and come to my ball with your daughter.
Cinderella? Sire, but she’s such a little child!
Do as you please, but bear in mind that I will have such a fest, that will make you forget all of your hardships and sorrows.
Farewell!
Everything is familiar here... the clock... the broom... frying pans... fire iron... fire... fireplace...
Let’s have a heart-to-heart talk.
Do you know what am I thinking of?
I think about the following:
My mother and my sisters were invited to the ball.
But I wasn't...
It isn't fair.
Is it?
They will dance with the Prince.
But he has never heard about me.
They will eat ice-cream ...
But I won't.
Though no one in the world likes ice-cream as I do.
While polishing the floor, I learned to dance.
While suffering insults in vain, I learned to think.
Listening to the cat’s purring
I learned to sing. And no one knows about that...
It hurts, doesn’t it?
I want it so much that people notice what kind of person I am.
But I want people to notice it themselves.
With no please and bother from my side.
Because I am very proud.
Can it be true that it will never happen?
Can it be true that I will never have joy and happiness?
Indeed, it is very bad when the one who deserves to go to the ball never does.
One can fall ill because of that!
I want happiness to come to me.
It is so boring to receive presents only from myself. on my birthday or on holidays.
Good people, where are you?
Good people, hey, good people?
Well then...
I will comfort myself: when everyone's gone, I will run to the Court park,
I will stand beneath the windows and feast my eyes at celebration at least from afar.
So you are dancing...
I am rushed off my feet from weariness preparing for the King's ball, but you are just dancing.
I care about you much more than about my own daughters.
I haven’t given a single notice to them for months.
While I foster you all day long.
Where’s the gratitude?
Where’s the gratitude?
I know you wanted to run away to the ball today.
Only when everyone’s gone, mother, for no one will need me then.
Follow me, Cinderella.
Do you know, my little girls, what was this good-for-nothing doing?
She was dancing!
Dancing, before you have sewn down  my ruffles?
I sewed them down a while ago, sister Anna.
Dancing, before you ironed my collar?
I ironed it a while ago, sister Marianna
She was dancing!
Thoughtless about how tired I am preparing for the royal ball!
I made some coffee to refresh you, I’ll bring it right away.
Keep where you are, you impudent one!
She knows all the answers!
She does everything to drive us crazy!
She likes nothing better than arguing!
Where’s your father, you ungrateful?
Where’s this monster?
I saw him in the forest nearby.
What was he doing there?
- He was speaking to the King.
To the king?
To the king! To the king!
He was speaking ...
To the king? Why didn’t you report that to me?
Where are you, poisonous snake?
Hellhound!
Hey, hellhound!
I’m here, my darling.
Where were you?
- In the forest.
What were you doing there?
I wanted to fight the Mad Bear.
What for?
- To rest from domestic cares, my darling.
Look into my eyes, look into my eyes!
Is it truth that you have spoken to the King?
- The very truth, my dear wife.
Have you begged the King to raise your wages?
Somehow it hasn’t come to my mind.
Well, have you begged the King to register me and my little girls in the Book of the reigning beauties of the Kingdom?
What are you talking about, darling, is it possible...
So, you have spoken to the King and wheedled nothing out of him?
Of course, but we’ve been chatting just like friends.
Poisonous snake!
They have upset me before the ball.
Why do I have to do everything?
I work like a beaver!
I run and I bustle, I beg and I quiz, I beseech enchant..
I get and I gain.
I’ve got such connections that the King himself could envy me.
But that monster...
No!
That is settled then, I will drive you out of your own house.
And you will die in the forest, and your Mad Bear will eat you!
No, dear mother, don’t! Look what I’ve made.
I made this rose from satin shreds.
It looks just like real one!
A disgusting flower.
What for an ugliness!
What a bad taste!
You could pin it to your ball dress, it would be so beatiful.
But if you don’t like it I will throw it away.
Give it to me! Give it to me!
You've said it was tasteless!
But you've shrieked it was ugly!
My dear little girls!
Don’t be angry, don’t quarrel!
To cease the quarrelling I will take the flower myself.
Are the ball dresses, which I told you to sew down during one night, ready?
Yes, mother.
Show them!
What a bad taste!
What for ugliness!
Cinderella, you wanted to run to the park and stand beheath the king’s windows.
You may do so, my dear.
- Thank you!
Just put the rooms in order, before you go.
Wash the windows, wax the floors, white the kitchen, weed out the garden, plant 7 rosebushes under the windows, sort 7 bags of beans: separate white and brown beans.
Get to know thyself, and grind coffee beans for 7 weeks.
But I will not finish even in a month.
Hurry up, my dear, hurry up.
They tease me calling me Cinderella because I work at fireside not sparing myself
I go round and round the kitchen
I am busy with oven all the time
I am always in cinders
Because of my kindness
I slave away from morning deep into the night.
Anyone can command me but no one wants to thank me.
I hide my sorrow
I sing instead of weeping
I even smile
Will I ever leave this place with its cinder and soot
Hello, goddaughter!
Godmother!
Dear godmother, you always appear all of a sudden!
Yes, I like to do so.
But last time you appeared out of the dark corner behind the fireplace.
Today you come over the air!
Yes, I am such an inventor.
You still can’t get used to the way I change!
I am delighted with that, I love miracles so much.
There wasn’t any miracle so far.
We, the true fairies, are so emotional that we can grow old or young as easily as you, humans, turn pale or red.
We grow old for sorrow and grow young for joy.
You see, how glad I am to meet you.
Today you were offended
24 times.
Of which for nothing...
- 24 times.
Today you deserved praise...
333 times.
- But they...
Did not praise you even once.
I hate those who want to do nothing and adore those who work hard.
I adore you and hate your evil step-mother.
I would turn her into a frog a long time ago, but old woman has too many connections.
Let’s talk about you. Do you want to go to the ball?
Yes, godmother, I want it very much, but I can’t.
Don’t argue, you’ll go there.
It is very bad when the one who deserves to go to the ball never goes there.
But I have so many things to do, godmother!
Today the friends will work instead of you
Boy!
Hares will weed out the garden, mice will sort the beans, cats will grind the coffee beans.
What about the roses?
Roses? Roses will grow on their own.
In a moment I am starting to work miracles.
I adore this job. Boy, give me the magic stick!
First of all, let’s roll a pumpkin here.
Thank you, dear godmother.
Wait, silly girl, how can you coach without horses.
Thank you, dear godmother.
Wait, silly girl, how can you coach without a coachman.
Miracles are not over.
Coachman!
Coachman!
Bring the coach to the doorsteps after 5 minutes.
May I go now?
O, dear, in fact, you are still such a little girl.
How can you go to the ball in such dress!
Is it me?
- Yes, it's you.
You can trust me, I can see through the people.
Even through those, whom I love very much.
I can see clear that even in splendid ball dress you stayed the same nice, industrious, kind-hearted girl.
Stay like this. This will bring you luck.
Let us go now, I will hand you into the coach.
Excuse me.
I am not a wizard, I am just a apprentice.
But let me make a few remarks, listen to me.
Let’s listen to him, he’s a good boy; an excellent pupil, he reads a lot, even makes verses.
Speak, boy, we are listening to you.
Dear Cinderella, I watch you working all day long.
You have magical hands, amazing patience and you are very kind.
You don’t know that, but I’ve become your true friend.
Though I am not a wizard, but merely a apprentice. let me tell you that friendship can work real wonders.
These glass slippers will bring you luck!
Take them.
Thank you, dear boy, I will never forgive your kindness.
And now, my dear, remember the most important thing.
You must return on the stroke of 12.
At midnight your new dress will turn into old and poor one.
The horses will turn into mice, coachman into rat and coach into pumpkin.
Remember that.
Well, I will remember that.
Boy!
Thank you, dear godmother.
Good evening.
Finally. I’m very glad.
May I present myself? King!
Don’t curtsey on stairs, it is very dangerous.
Good evening, don’t take your glove off,
I am so happy that you have come.
Good evening.
O, Your Majesty, it’s such a annoyance!
Your beautiful bertha torn and everyone can see that.
Where?
- Look!
What a horrible thing!
What an outrage, why haven’t my courtiers reported that?
Cowards, liars, flatterers!
I am resigning; I am shutting up in cloister immediately!
Since my courtiers behave so badly, farewell, my good lady.
How can you get upset because of such a trifle?
Oh, oh, oh! Don’t worry.
I will mend it so no one can see it.
Do you have a needle and cotton?
- Sure.
I am careful.
In this case, let it be so, I am staying on the throne.
Sit down, Your Majesty.
Like this, to make it handier, just sit calm and don’t move or I can jab you.
You can’t imagine how glad I am!
I adore new mysterious guests.
Certainly, the old friends are good. but I know everything about them.
For instance, Puss in Boots; he is a regular fellow, clever cookie, but when he comes he takes his boots off and sleeps at fireside.
He never plays or runs with me.
Or Tom Thumb, he always plays for money.
Hide-and-seek. Try to find him!  That's too bad!
The most important thing is that their time has passed, their fairy tales are played...
While you are...
I, the fairytale king, tell you that you are on the verge of an amazing event!
Is that so?
Upon the word of King’s honour!
It is as simple as that! It wasn’t worthy to be noisy and capricious, was it?
Wonderwork, nothing can be seen!
You’ve got magic hands!
And you speak so simply, so frankly.
I’m so happy to see you! Let’s go.
Prince looked at me 3 times, he smiled once...
- 3 times.
He draw a sigh once.
Once. 5 altogether.
The King said to me: “I am glad to see you” once,
Once.
Ho! Ho! Ho! - once.
Move along, there is a draught here – once.
Once.
3 altogether.
What do you need these notes for?
Don’t to be an intruder on our joys, monster!
He always grumbles. Such a ball...
5+3=9. Total:
9 expressions of high regard from persons of the highest rank.
Now, my dear, I will gain my object to enlist you in the Kingdom’s Book of the reigning beauties
10 expressions of high regard!
Prince, sonny!
Look, who’s come to visit us!
Do you recognise her?
Who is she? So?
Mysterious and beautiful stranger.
What a smart boy! True enough!
Why are you so pale?
Why are you silent?
Sire, I am silent because I can't talk.
Don’t believe him, he can.
Verses, speeches and compliments.
Let’s go!
I am going to introduce my court to you!
Haven't you get tired on the way?
No, I haven't, I took a rest on the way.
Let me introduce to you a girl, who has never been here before.
Supernaturally sincere and fabulously sweet.
Let me introduce my ministers to you:
The minister of ball-room dancing.
Sir marquis de Pas de trois
Your Majesty, I know this girl!
This girl is a beautiful flower.
A very striking compliment.
Don’t you recognise me?
I don’t dare to.
Now we are going to play the Royal forfeits.
No one deposits any forfeits and no one redeems any forfeits,
Everyone will do what the King wants them to.
The first forfeit is yours.
How do you find it here, my lady?
- I like it here very much.
Then, could you sing something and dance for us?
All right.
She doesn’t make difficulties! What a good girl! Sonny!
I’m going to sing you a little song.
A bit of magic.
It just makes you heart high.
It is called "Good beetle".
Kids, form yourself into a ring!
Once there lived a good beetle, an old mutual friend
He never muttered or shouted, just buzzed with his wings and strictly forbade to quarrel.
Kids, form yourself into a ring!
I'm your friend and you're my friend, an old devoted friend!
We got to love our old good beetle for his kind soul, what a merry fellow!
Kids, form yourself into a ring!
I'm your friend and you're my friend, an old devoted friend!
Who is that nice old man, who is dancing without music?
He is the kindest wizard in the world.
He can refuse no request.
Evil people often took advantage of his kindness, so he stopped his ears with wax.
Now he can hear neither requests nor music.
Arrange it that my daughters were enlisted in the Kingdom’s Book of the reigning beauties.
Listen!
The first.
Beauties.
Excuse me, madam, The next forfeit is yours.
Make something good, magical, miraculous and pleasant for all, who are present.
It's as simple as anything, Your Majesty!
- Wonderful!
Don’t be afraid!
I’m not afraid in the least bit.
I expected the wonders from this night.
Here they are!
Yet, where are we?
We were carried to Wonderland.
Where are the others?
Everyone is in the place he feels pleasant.
Wonderland is vast.
But we won’t stay here long.
One can be here just 9 minutes 10 seconds and not a moment longer.
It hurts, doesn’t it?
Do you feel sad?
I don't know...
May I ask you a question?
You are welcome.
A friend of mine ...
He’s a prince, too, he’s quite brave and decisive, too, and he met a girl at the ball, too.
He liked the girl so much that he was wholly at a loss.
What would you advise him?
May it be that the prince just seemed to like the girl?
No, he knows for sure that nothing of the kind ever happened to him and will never happen again.
You are like a dream or a vision
What if I scare you away with my clumsy touch?
What if fall into forgetful sleep for a moment and wake up in despair?
What if fall into forgetful sleep for a moment and wake up in despair?
Dear, kind, mysterious guest.
Dear, kind, mysterious guest.
Your time is up, your time is up, end your conversation.
End your conversation...
Are we still in Wonderland?
I don’t know.
I think we are.
What do you think?
- So do I.
May I have the next dance with you, o charming young lady?
I beg your pardon, marquis, but our guest has been already invited by me!
You know, Prince, there have been some days when I got so tired that I was dreaming about sleeping even when I was asleep.
But today I'm so happy; I am dancing and I want to dance more and more.
Wonderland! What a success I had there!
What a hairdressing saloon is there!
What a perfume is there!
Thank you!
The wine we drank from a magic glass in the magic tavern was fabulously excellent!
Try to guess what am I thinking of?
You think it would be lovely to have some ice-cream.
I am ashamed to confess, you are right.
Finally, I am happy!
An hour, a full hour and 15 minutes.
One hour!
Dear Cinderella!
I have a very sad news.
Sad?
- Don’t get upset!
The King ordered to set back the clock one hour.
He wanted guests to dance longer.
That is, I have nearly no time left?
Nearly.
I'm begging you, don’t get upset!
I am not a wizard; I am merely a apprentice, but I think everything can still come to a happy end!
The best ice-cream in the world, I've selected it personally!
What's the matter with you?
Thank you, dear prince. Thank you for everything.
Thank you for your care. Thank you for your politeness, tenderness and kindness. You are the best person I ever met.
Why are you talking to me so sadly?
Because I have to leave.
No, I can't let you go!
I thought it over, after the ice-cream I would have told you straight that I love you.
What am  I talking?
Don’t go!
Stay!
I may not!
I am not as ridiculous as it seems to you, it's just because I love you.
It’s no good to be angry with one because of that!
Forgive me!
I love you.
The boy got so active!
Dear Cinderella!
I brought this ruby glass of ice-cream to comfort you.
Do me a favour, taste it. I will return the glass to the palace.
Do you want some?
What happened? Are you sick, my boy?
I knew it!
I am absolutely healthy, Sire!
It is bad to cheat the old man!
40 serves of ice-cream!
You have overeaten! Such a shame, 40 serves; you haven't allowed yourself such a surfeit since you were 6.
Your stomach is frost-bitten!
I haven’t touched the ice-cream!
Really?
Indeed. What’s the matter with you then?
I fell in love.
Yes, I fell in love. with our kind and mysterious guest.
But she ran away so fast, that this glass slipper slipped off her foot and fell on the stairs.
You fell in love?
You fell in love?
I am resigning.
Deuce!  Hell! Why nobody reported me that he has grown up?
I’ve sung you the whole song about it!
Really?
All right then, I'll stay.
The boy fell in love.
It is such a happiness!
- It isn't happiness!
Nonsense!
- She loves me not!
Nonsense, she does, that’s why she didn’t stay for supper!
No, papa!
I feel offended!
I will find her!
Hello!
Gatekeepers of the Fairy Kingdom, can you hear me?
We are listening, Your Majesty!
Has the girl crossed the gate of the Fairy Kingdom?
Having a single slipper on?
How many slippers did she have on?
One!
Blonde or brunette?
Blonde!
How old was she?
About 16!
Pretty?
Very pretty!
Nobody crossed the gate!
Why did you questioned me so thoroughly, fools?
Out of idle curiosity!
Do not let anybody out, all right?
Lock the gate!
Soldiers, do you know what love is?
My only son and heir fell in love for real.
Do you understand the situation?
They had had an important conversation and then she ran away.
That can happen.
- Don’t interrupt me!
What can we do?
I will go with the minister round the country watching through spyglasses, but you will search the girl with the help of this glass slipper.
The girl who can fit the slipper upon her foot is the Prince’s bride.
Is it clear?
It’s clear!
Now go to my treasury; there you will be given seven-leagued boots for swiftness.
I wish the girl to be found before nightfall.
Good morning, madams!
Excuse us for our discourtesy.
It is known that it is improper to appear without the boots before the ladies’ eyes.
Begging your pardon, madams, they are seven-league boots.
I see, Corporal, why did you put them on?
To catch the prince’s bride, madam!
These boots exhaust us, they take us far beside the target.
You won’t believe it, madam, how many girls we left behind immediately after start.
And even more girls were frightened out of their wits.
Let me ask your daughters to fit the slipper.
You are welcome, which size?
I don’t know, but the girl who can fit the slipper upon her foot is the Prince’s bride.
The slipper fits upon the foot of one of my daughter, corporal, call for the King!
I'm telling you, the slipper fits upon the foot of one of my daughter!
I would be very grateful.
You know what I mean?
I will load you with money!
Thank you, but what about fitting?
Two barrels of wine!
I can’t do it without fitting, an order is an order.
Anna, Mary-Anna!
Draw your big toe in!
The heel.
Have you another size?
- Negative, madam.
What is to be done?
Cinderella!
She has magical hands, she can do everything!
Cinderella!
Cinderella, sometimes we were at quarrel with you, but you shouldn’t be angry with us because of that.
I aways meant well to you.
Repay me with good!
You can do everything, you have magical hands!
Mother!
Cinderella, put this slipper on...
- On my foot!
Anna’s foot.
If the slipper fits her foot the prince will marry her!
Mother, I can’t...
- Cinderella,
I am begging you, my dear, beloved daughter.
But I can’t!
- Cinderella, help Anna!
Help Anna!
Not at any price!
Go and say farewell to your father.
I will drive him out of his own home.
You know about my connections; he’ll lose his head, he’ll die in prison or in dungeon.
Don’t!
Hey, hubby!
- Mother!
All right!
I...
I’ll try.
Congratulations, Anna!
Your Royal Highness!
Well, now they will get it hot!
I will introduce my own rules. Don’t cry, Mary-Anna
The King is a widower, I’ll get a place for you, too.
It’s a pity the Kingdom is too small, there's little one can afford.
Well, I'll scrap with the neighbours, I’m good at it!
Soldiers, go to the palace on bare feet, follow the Royal mother-in-law!
Forward, march! Hurrah!
I scared you, my child!
Don’t be afraid, I’m not a villain or bad man.
I am just an unhappy prince.
I have been wandering in the forest from the first light.
I am out of my mind with worry!
Do you know who was singing in the forest nearby?
Have you met anybody?
Never in my life was I so unhappy.
I have to find this girl to ask her why has she offended me.
I can’t see you, but somehow it seems to me that you are a good girl.
Help me!
Wait!
Wait!
I don’t know, maybe I went mad.
Wasn’t it you who was singing here, in the forest?
The way you shake your head seems familiar to me!
And this golden hair! Show me your face!
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
If an evil wizard put spell on you, I will kill him!
If you are poor and simple girl, I will be glad to hear it.
Princesses always play hard-to-get.
If you don’t love me
I will perform many feats of valour and make you to like me!
Say something!
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where’s she?
Where is she, my dear daughter?
Here she is, Your Majesty, my dear son-in-law!
Nonsense!
Why nonsense? Take a look at her foot!
I don’t need to look at her foot since her face shows that it isn’t she.
But the slipper fits her foot!
It isn’t she anyway!
A King's word is a word of honour! The glass slipper fits her foot, consequently, she is the Prince's bride, that’s what you have told to the soldiers.
Is it true, soldiers?
They are silent!
No-no-no, it's a done deal, my dear son-in-law!
Damn it! What a mess, what should we do, marquis?
Of course, we should dance!
What’s the matter with you, my beauty?
You are walking lamely, my beauty!
Softy!
The slipper ran away from you, beauty!
It is impossibly small for you!
What a wizard managed to put it on your foot?
It is too small for you either, miss!
It doesn’t matter!
The unknown beauty has lost this slipper in the palace, too!
But it was a bit large for the unknown beauty.
Intriguer!
I will complain to the King!
I will complain against the King! Your Majesty!
It’s all right, madam, don’t be upset.
Maybe you have one more daughter?
She has!
Please, don’t chuckle!
Who is this girl?
My own daughter, Cinderella.
She is as kind as I am!
For father’s sake she helped Anna to put the slipper on.
But I didn't know anything!
I found her weeping bitterly in the garden.
Look what she wept at!
Another one!
It’s her!
Look at her, it’s her.
Prince, where’s the prince?
What for fabulous piggishness!
I can stay in this kingdom no longer!
You snake!
Follow me, my little girls!
Who do you think you are, you just put the crown in your head.
Where’s the prince?
His Royal Highness...
To chase away his worries, he ran away, at 11 o’clock, local time.
It’s my fault, why didn’t I tell everything to the prince?
Now everyone will be lost, the prince and I... the king and the whole kingdom!
Prince, dear prince, where are you?
He’s here!
He’s here!
Sonny!
I am not a wizard, I am just a apprentice, but friendship can work real wonders!
Good boy, I give you a distinction.
Change into other clothes, Cinderella, your wedding-day is near.
Get married, get married!
Yet Cinderella hasn’t told if she loves me.
I don’t like when people are disturbed while sorting out their relationship.
Well, my friends, we found our way to entire happiness.
Everyone is happy.
Except, old Forester’s wife, but it's her own fault.
Connections are connections, but one must have conscience, too.
One day you will be asked: what can you present?
And no connection can help to make a foot small, make a soul  great and a heart  fair.
Page-boy will find his happiness, too.
A daughter will be born to the prince, she will be the spitting image of Cinderella.
And the page-boy will fall in love in her.
And I will gladly bestow my granddaughter in marriage to him.
I adore these wonderful features of his soul: faithfulness, generosity, ability to love.
I adore these fabulous feelings, which will never come to an... end.
THE END
When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires
Will come to you
If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
Fate is kind
She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfilment of
Their secret longing
Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in
And sees you through
When you wish
Upon a star
Your dreams
Come true
Pretty, huh?
I'll bet a lot of you folks don't believe that.
About a wish coming true, do you?
Well, I didn't either.
Of course, I'm just a cricket singing my way from hearth to hearth...
...but... let me tell you what made me change my mind.
One night, a long time...
Pardon me. Wait 'til I, I fix this thing here.
There.
One night, a long time ago...
...my travels took me to a quaint little village.
It was a beautiful night.
The stars were shining like diamonds...
...high above the roofs of that sleepy old town.
Pretty as a picture.
As I wandered along the crooked streets...
...there wasn't a soul to be seen.
The only sign of life was a lighted window...
...in the shop of a wood-carver named, uh, Geppetto.
So, I hopped over.
And looked in.
It was a shame to see a nice cheerful fire like that going to waste.
So what do I do?
I go in.
I looked around.
Of course, being in a strange place like that...
...I didn't know what to expect.
A cricket can't be too careful, you know.
Soon as I saw there was no one about, I made myself at home.
As I stood there warming my... myself, I took a look around.
Well, sir, you never saw such a place.
The most fantastic clocks you ever laid your eyes on.
And all carved out of wood.
And cute little music boxes, each one a work of art.
Shelf after shelf of toys and...
And then something else caught my eye.
A puppet!
You know, one of those marionette things...
...all strings and joints.
Cute little fella.
Ding, ding! Going up?
Good piece of wood too.
Well, now.
It won't take much longer.
Just a little more paint and he's all finished.
I think he'll be all right.
Don't you, Figaro?
Um, huh, uh, beg pardon.
See?
That makes a big difference.
Very good.
Very, very goo...
Well, you can't please everybody.
Now, I have just the name for you.
Pinocchio!
Do you like it, Figaro?
No? You do, don't you, Cleo?
Well, we'll leave it to little Woodenhead.
Do you like it?
That settles it!
Pinocchio it is!
Come on, now, we'll try you out.
Music, Professor!
Hey! Ow, ow, ow, ouch!
Ta-Ta-Take it easy there!
Oh, break it up, will you?
Lot of downbeats in there.
Little Woodenhead
Go play your part
Bring a littlejoy to every heart
Little do you know and yet it's true
That I'm mighty proud of you
Little wooden feet and best of all
Little wooden seat in case you fall
Oh-ho! How graceful!
My little Woodenhead
Cleo, meet Pinocchio.
Say, "How do you do?"
Say hello to Figaro.
Oops! Oh-ho-ho!
Up to mischief already.
You see what happens?
Boo!
Up we go!
You're a cute little fellow.
And that smile?
You know, I....
You rascal. Jealous, huh?
You know, Pinocchio, I think
Figaro is jealous of you.
Oh-ho, don't worry, Figaro.
I sti... Uh-oh.
I wonder what time it is.
It's getting late.
Come, now. We go to bed.
Good night, Pinocchio.
Little funny face.
Good night, Cleo, my little water baby.
Figaro.
You say good night too.
Go on.
Now go to sleep, my little mermaid.
Good night.
This is my idea of comfort.
Solid comfort.
Look at him, Figaro.
He almost looks alive.
Wouldn't it be nice if he was a real boy?
Oh, well.
Come on. We go to sleep.
Ah, Figaro.
I forgot to open the window.
Oh, Figaro! Look, look!
The wishing star!
Star light, star bright, first star I see tonight;
I wish I may, I wish I might...
...have the wish I make tonight.
Figaro, you know what I wish?
I wish that my little Pinocchio...
...might be a real boy.
Wouldn't that be nice?
Just think!
A real boy!
A very lovely thought.
But not at all practical.
A real...
...boy.
Quiet!
After all, enough's enough.
Now what's up?
Hey, what's going on here?
As I live and breathe, a fairy!
Mm-mmm.
Good Geppetto, you have given so much happiness to others.
You deserve to have your wish come true.
Little puppet made of pine...
...wake.
The gift of life is thine.
Whew! What they can't do these days!
I can move!
I can talk!
I can walk!
- Yes, Pinocchio, I've given you life.
- Why?
Because tonight, Geppetto wished for a real boy.
- Am I a real boy?
- No, Pinocchio.
To make Geppetto's wish come true will be entirely up to you.
Up to me?
Prove yourself brave, truthful and unselfish...
...and someday you will be a real boy.
A real boy!
That won't be easy.
You must learn to choose between right and wrong.
Right and wrong?
But how will I know?
- How will he know.
- Your conscience will tell you.
- What are conscience?
- What are conscience!
I'll tell ya!
A conscience is that still small voice that people won't listen to.
That's just the trouble with the world today, you see?
- Are you my conscience?
Who, me?
Would you like to be
Pinocchio's conscience?
Well, w... uh, I...
Very well.
What is your name?
Oh, Cricket's the name.
Jiminy Cricket.
- Kneel, Mr Cricket.
- Huh?
No tricks now.
I dub you
Pinocchio's conscience...
...lord high keeper of the knowledge of right and wrong...
...counsellor in moments of temptation...
...and guide along the straight and narrow path.
Arise, Sir Jiminy Cricket.
Well! Oh-ho-ho!
My, my!
Mmm. Say, that's pretty swell.
Gee... thanks.
But, uh, don't I get a badge or something?
- Well, we'll see.
- You mean maybe I will?
- I shouldn't wonder.
- Make it a gold one?
Maybe.
Now, remember, Pinocchio, be a good boy.
And always let your conscience be your guide.
Goodbye, milady.
Goodbye!
Not bad, says I.
Oh, yeah. Ho-ho-ho.
Almost forgot about you.
Well, Pinoke.
Maybe you and I had better have a little heart-to-heart talk.
Why?
- Well, you want to be a real boy, don't you?
- Uh-huh!
All right. Sit down, son.
- Now, you see, the world is full of temptations.
- Temptations?
Yep. Temptations.
They're the wrong things that seem right at the time.
But, uh, even though the right things may seem wrong sometimes...
...uh, sometimes the, the wrong things may be right at the wrong time.
Or, uh, visa versa.
Understand?
But I'm gonna do right!
Atta boy, Pinoke.
And I'm gonna help you.
And anytime you need me, you know, just whistle.
Like this.
Like this?
No, no. Try it again, Pinoke.
Like this?
No, son. Now, listen.
That's it! Come on, now, let's sing it!
When you get in trouble and you don't know right from wrong
Give a little whistle
Give a little whistle
When you meet temptation and the urge is very strong
Give a little whistle
Give a little whistle
Not just a little squeak
Pucker up and blow
- And if your whistle's weak, yell
- Jiminy Cricket?
Right! Take the straight and narrow path and if you start to slide
Give a little whistle
Give a little whistle
And always let your conscience be your guide
Take the straight and narrow path and if you start to slide
Give a little whistle
Give a little whistle
Whoo-hoo!
And always let your conscience be your guide
And always let your conscience be your guide
- Who is there?
- It's me!
Oh, it's me.
Shh, Figaro.
There's somebody in here.
Be careful now, Figaro.
He might spring out on us at any time.
He's in here somewhere.
Here I am!
Oh... Pinocchio.
How did you get down here?
- I fell down.
- Oh, you did.
Ohh! You're talking!
- N-N-N-No!
- Yes, and I can move too!
No, n-no, you, you can't.
I-I'm dreaming in my sleep.
W-W-Wake me up. Wake me up!
Now we see who is dreaming.
Go on. Say something.
Gee, you're funny.
Do it again!
- You do talk!
- Yes, the Blue Fairy came...
The Blue Fairy?
- And I got a conscience.
- A conscience!
And someday I'm gonna be a real boy!
A real boy! It is my wish.
It's come true!
Figaro, look!
He... He's alive. He can talk!
- Let's say hello to Figaro.
- Hello to Figaro.
Ohh. Oh, Cleo, I almost forgot.
Look! It's Pinocchio!
She's my little water baby.
Isn't she cute?
Yeah, cute.
This calls for a celebration.
Music!
You start one, Pinocchio.
Oh, boy. A party!
Mind if I cut in?
How about sitting out the next one, babe, huh?
Whoop! Hey, whoa, let me out!
Let me out!
Come, Cleo, join the party.
Dance!
Ooh, nice.
Gathering toys
For my little boy
Look! Pretty!
Help!
Wh-Wh-Wh-Where's the bucket?
Help! Water! Where's the water?
Here it is! I got it!
Here's water! Here's some water!
Help! Where's water?
That was close.
Maybe we'd better go to bed...
...before something else happens.
Little man, you've had a busy night.
Now, close your eyes and go to sleep.
Why?
Oh, everybody has to sleep.
Figaro goes to sleep... and Cleo...
...and besides, tomorrow you've got to go to school.
Why?
Oh, to learn things and...
...and get smart.
Why?
Because...
- Oh, look, Father! Look!
- Now, wait. Stand still now.
- What are those?
- Huh? Oh, those.
They are your schoolmates.
Girls and boys. Uh, no-now, get in...
- Real boys?
- Yes.
But hurry now.
Oh, oh, wai-wai-wait! Wait. Eh...
Here's an apple for your teacher. Now turn around...
...and let me look you over.
Huh? Oh, yeah, yeah.
Here.
Run along now.
Fig, wait!
Come back here, Figaro.
School is not for you.
Goodbye, Father.
Goodbye, son.
Hurry back.
Ah, Gideon, listen.
The merry laughter...
...of little innocent children wending their way to school.
Thirsty little minds rushing to the fountain of knowledge.
School, a noble institution.
What would this stupid world be without...
Well, well, well!
Stromboli!
So that old rascal's back in town, eh?
Remember, Giddy, the time
I tied strings on you...
...and passed you off as a puppet?
We nearly put one over on that old gypsy that time.
A little wooden boy.
Now, who'd have...
A wooden boy!
Look, Giddy, look!
It's amazing.
A live puppet without strings.
A thing like that ought to be worth a fortune to someone.
Now let me see.
That's it! Stromboli!
Why, that fat old faker would give his... Listen.
If we play our cards right, we'll be on Easy Street...
...or my name isn't Honest John.
Quick, we'll head him off.
Shh! Now's our...
No, no, stupid.
Don't be crude.
Let me handle this.
Here he comes.
Ah, yes, Skinny, as I was saying to the Duchess only yesterday...
Oh! Oh, how clumsy of me.
Oh, my, my, my, my.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
Oh, I do hope you're not injured.
- I'm all right.
- Oh, splendid.
Well, well, hmm.
Quite a scholar, I see.
Look, Giddy, a man of letters.
- Here's your book.
- I'm going to school.
School. Ah, yes.
Then you haven't heard of the easy road to success.
- Uh-uh.
- No?
I'm speaking, my boy, of the theatre.
Here's your apple.
Bright lights, music...
...applause, fame!
- Fame?
- Yes!
And with that personality, that profile, that physique...
...he's a natural born actor, eh, Giddy?
- But I'm going...
- Straight to the top.
Why, I can see your name in lights, lights six feet high.
- Uh... What is your name?
- Pinocchio.
Pinocchio! P-I-N... Eh, uh...
...U-O... Eh, P-I... Eh...
We're wasting precious time.
Come, on to the theatre.

Shh!
Why, my boy, huh, you must be seeing things.
Oh, no, that's my conscience. He...
Now, now, now.
Just calm down.
Why, there's nothing up there to be afraid of.
Oh!
Psst! Pinoke!
Psst! Pinoke! Over here.
- Over here.
- Oh, Jiminy!
- I'm going to be an actor.

Oh, no, Jiminy, that's Mr Honest John.
Honest John?
Get this thing off.
Get me outta here!
Get me out of here!

Pinocchio!
Oh, Pinocchio!
Here they come, Pinoke.
Now, you tell 'em.

Ah, yes, on to the theatre!
Goodbye, Jiminy!

- A watch of gold with a diamond chain
- There he goes.
- Oh, what'll I do? I'll run and tell his father.
- Hi diddle dee day
- An actor's life is gay
- No, that'd be snitching.
I'll go after him myself.
Ladies and gentlemen...
...to conclude the performance of this great show...
...Stromboli the Master Showman... that's a-me...
...and by special permission of the management...
...that's a-me too...
...is presenting to you something...
...you will absolutely refuse to believe.
Well, looks like a sell-out.
Introducing the only marionette...
...who can sing and dance...
...absolutely without the aids of strings.
I hope so.
The one and only... Pinocchio!
Hmph! What a build-up.
I got no strings to hold me dow...
Go ahead, make a fool of yourself.
Then maybe you'll listen to your conscience.
Cute kid.
I got no strings to hold me down
To make me fret or make me frown
I had strings but now I'm free
There are no strings on me
Heigh-ho the merry-o
That's the only way to be
I want the world to know
Nothing ever worries me
I got no strings so I can have fun
- What I told you, huh?
- I'm not tied up with anyone
They got strings but you can see
There are no strings on me
You have no strings
Your arms is free
To love me by the Zuider Zee
Ja, ja, ja
If you would woo
I'd bust my strings for you
You got no strings
Comme ci, comme ca
Your savoir faire is ooo-la-la
I've got strings but entre nous
I'd cut my strings for you
Down where the Volga flows
There's a Russian rendezvous
Where me and Ivan go
But I'd rather go with you
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
- Hey!
- Hey!
There are no strings on me
Hmm, they like him.
He's a success.
Gosh, maybe I was wrong.
Well, guess he won't need me any more.
What does an actor want with a conscience anyway?
What could have happened to him?
Where could he be at this hour?
I'd better go out again and look for him.
And remember, nobody eats a bite until I find him.
I got-a no strings but I got-a the brain
I buy a new suit and I swing-a the chain
I eat-a the best and I drink-a champagne
I got-a no strings on me
- Bravo, Pinocchio!
- They like me.
Hmm, two hundred.
- You are sensational!
- Ya mean I'm good?
Ahh, three hundred.
You are colossal!
Does that mean I'm an actor?
Sure. I will push you in the public's eye.
Your face, she will be on everybody's tongue.
- Will she?
- Ye... Uh, huh?
What's this?
Ahhh!
For you, my little Pinocchio.
For me? Gee, thanks!
I'll run right home and tell my father.
Home?
Oh, sure. Going home to your father.
Oh, that is very comical!
- Ya mean it's funny?
- Oh, sure! Yes.
- I'll be back in the morning.
- Be back in the morning.
Going home.
There, this will be your home...
...where I can find you always.
- No, no, no!
- Yes, yes, yes!
To me you are belonging.
We will tour the world.
Paris. London.
Monte Carlo.
"Constantinopolee."
- No, no!
- Yes!
We start tonight!
Hmm.
You will make lots of money... for me!
And when you are growing too old...
...you will make good... firewood!
Let me outta here! I gotta get out! You can't keep me!
Quiet! Shut-a up...
...before I knock-a you silly!
Good night...
...my little wooden gold mine.
No! No, wait! Let me out!
I'll tell my father!
Giddy-up!
Get along there.
Jiminy!
Oh, Jiminy!
Oh, Jiminy, where are ya?
Jiminy Cricket!
Well, there he goes.
Sitting in the lap of luxury, the world at his feet.
Oh, well, I can always say I knew him when.
I'll just go out of his life quietly.
I would like to wish him luck though.
Sure! Why not?
Pinocchio.
Pinocchio!
It's me, your old friend Jiminy, remember?
Jiminy! Gee, I'm glad to see ya!
Pinocchio!
What's happened?
- What did he do to ya?
- Oh, he was mad.
He said he was gonna push my face in everybody's eye.
- Yeah?
- A-A-And just 'cause I'm a gold brick...
...he-he's gonna chop me into firewood!
Oh, is that so?
Now, don't you worry, son.
I'll have you out of here in no time at all.
Why, this is... eh, just as easy as... rollin' off a...
Kind of rusty.
- Needs a little oil!
- Needs a little oil, needs a little oil, a little oil.
That's what I said.
Must be one of the old models.
You mean, you can't open it?
Yeah.
Looks pretty hopeless.
It'll take a miracle to get us out of here.
Gee.
Pinocchio!
Pinocchio!
Giddy-up!
Pinocch...
A fine conscience
I turned out to be.
I should've listened to you, Jiminy.
No, it was my fault.
I shouldn't have walked out on you.
Guess I'll never see my father again.
Oh, buck up, son.
It could be worse.
Be cheerful, like me.
Aw, take it easy, son.
Come on, blow.
Thatta boy.
Oh, well, it stopped raining anyway.
Hey, that star again!
Uh, the lady, the... Ooh!
- The fairy!
- What'll she say?
- What'll I tell her?
- You might tell her the truth.
- Why, Pinocchio.
- Uh, eh, hello!
Sir Jiminy!
Well! Uh, this is a... a pleasant surprise. Ha-ha.
Pinocchio, why didn't you go to school?
School? Well, I... um...
Uh... Go ahead, tell her.
I was going to school
'til I met somebody.
- Met somebody?
- Yeah. Uh, two big monsters...
...with big green eyes!
- Why, I... I...
- Monsters?
Weren't you afraid?
No, ma'am.
But they tied me in a big sack.
You don't say!
And where was Sir Jiminy?
Eh, huh? Oh, Jiminy?
Hey, psst!
Leave me outta this.
They put him in a little sack.
- No!
- Yeah!
- How did you escape?
- I didn't.
They chopped me into firewood.
Oh! Oh, look!
My nose!
What's happened?
Perhaps you haven't been telling the truth, Pinocchio.
- "Perhaps"?
- Oh, but I have, every single word.
Oh, please help me!
I'm awful sorry.
You see, Pinocchio, a lie keeps growing and growing...
...until it's as plain as the nose on your face.
She's right, Pinoke.
You better come clean.
I'll never lie again.
Honest, I won't.
Please, Your Honor...
Uh, uh, I mean, Miss Fairy.
Give him another chance, for my sake.
Will ya, huh?
I'll forgive you this once.
But remember...
...a boy who won't be good might just as well be made of wood.
- We'll be good, won't we?
- We'll be good, won't we?
Very well. But this is the last time I can help you.
Gee, look, Jiminy, my nose!
Hey, we're free!
Come on, Pinoke!
I buy a new suit and I swing-a the cane
I eat-a the fish and I drink-a champagne
I got no strings on me
- Toodle-ooo, Stromboli.
- Goodbye, Mr Strombo...
Shh! Quiet! Let's get outta here before something else happens.
Hi diddle dee dee
An actor's life for me
A high silk hat and a silver cane
A watch of gold with a diamond chain
Hi diddle dee day
An actor's life is gay
It's great to be a celebrity
An actor's life for me
And the dummy fell for it...
...hook, line and sinker!
And he still thinks we're his friends.
And did Stromboli pay...
...plenty!
That shows you how low
Honest John will stoop...
...eh, Giddy?
Now, uh, coachman...
...what's your proposition?
Well...
...how would you blokes like to make some real money?
Well! And who do we have to, eh...
No, no!
Nothing like that.
You see...
I'm collecting stupid little boys.
- Stupid little boys?
- You know...
...the disobedient ones what play hookey from school.
And you see...
Yes.
Oh!
And I takes 'em to Pleasure Island!
Ah, Pleasure Island.
Pleasure Island?
But the law, suppose they...
No, no. There is no risk.
They never come back...
...as boys!
Now, I've got a coach load leaving at midnight.
We'll meet at the crossroads, and no double-crossing!
- No, sir.
- Scout around...
...and any good prospects you find, bring 'em to me.
- Yes, Chief.
- I'll pay you well.
- I got plenty of gold.
- Yes, yes.
No, sir, nothing can stop me now.
I'll make good this time.
- You'd better.
- I will. I'm going to school.
- That's the stuff, Pinoke.
- I'd rather be smart than be an actor.
Now you're talkin'! Come on, slowpoke, I'll race ya home.
Well, well, Pinocchio.
What's your rush?
I gotta beat Jiminy home.
Oh, hello.
Well, how is the great actor?
I don't wanna be an actor.
Stromboli was terrible.
- He was?
- Yeah, he locked me in a bird cage...
- He did?
- Uh-huh, but I learned my lesson.
I'm going...
Oh, you poor, poor boy.
You must be a nervous wreck.
That's it, you are a nervous wreck!
We must diagnose this case at once.
Quick, Doctor, your notebook.
Bless my soul.
Hmmm, mm-hmm.
My, my.
Just as I thought.
A slight touch of monetary complications...
...with bucolic semi-lunar contraptions of the flying trapezes.
Mm-hmm. Say "hippopotamus."
- Hi-ho-hotamus.
- I knew it!
Compound transmission of the pandemonium with percussion...
...and spasmodic frantic disintegration.
- Close your eyes. What do you see?
- Nothing.
- Open them. Now what do you see?
- Spots.
Aha! Now that heart.
Ooh, my goodness!
A palpitating syncopation of the killer diller...
...with the wicky wacky stomping of the floy joy.
Quick, Doctor, that report.
Ooh, this makes it perfectly clear!
My boy, you are allergic.
- Allergic?
- Yes, and there is only one cure.
- A vacation on Pleasure Island!
- Pleasure Island?
Yes, that happy land of carefree boys...
...where every day is a holiday!
- But I can't go. I...
- Why, of course you can go.
I'm giving you my ticket.
- Here.
- Thanks! But I'm...
Oh, tut-tut-tut-tut, I insist.
Your health comes first.
Come, the coach departs at midnight.
Hi diddle dee dee
It's Pleasure Isle for me
Where every day is a holiday
And kids have nothing to do but play
Pinoke!
Oh, Pinoke? Now where do you suppose he... Huh?
Pinocchio!
Hey! Come back!
Giddy-up!
Well...
...here we go again.
My name's Lampwick.
What's yours?
Pinocchio.
- Ever been to Pleasure Island?
- Uh-uh, but Mr Honest John gave me...
Me neither, but they say it's a swell joint. No school, no cops.
You can tear the joint apart, and nobody says a word.
- Honest John gave me...
- Loaf around, plenty to eat, plenty to drink.
- And it's all free!
- Honest John...
Boy, that's the place.
I can hardly wait!
Right here, boys!
Right here!
Get your cake, pie, dill pickles and ice cream.
Eat all you can. Be a glutton.
Stuff yourselves.
It's all free, boys. It's all free.
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry!
The Rough House.
The Rough House.
It's the roughest, toughest joint ya ever seen.
- Come in and pick a fight, boys.
- Oh, boy, a scrap!
Come on, let's go in and poke somebody in the nose.
- Why?
- Ah, just for the fun of it.
Okay, Lampy.
Tobacco Road. Tobacco Road.
Get your cigars, cigarettes and chewin' tobacco.
Come in and smoke your heads off.
There's nobody here to stop you.
Pinocchio!
Pinocchio! There's somethin'... phoney about all this.
I gotta get him outta here.
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry! See the model home.
It's open for destruction, and it's all yours, boys!
It's all yours!
What'd I tell ya?
Ain't this a swell joint?
Yeah! Bein' bad's a lot of fun, ain't it?
Yeah, uh-huh. Get a load of that stained-glass window.
All right now, hop to it, you blokes.
Come on, come on! Shut the doors and lock 'em tight.
Now get below and get them crates ready.
Give a bad boy enough rope and he'll soon make a jackass of himself.
Pinocchio!
Pinocchio?
Where is everybody?
The place is like a graveyard.
I don't like the looks of this.
Pinocchio!
Hey, where are you?
Where d'you suppose all the kids went to, Lampwick?
Ah, they're around here somewheres. What do you care?
- You're having a good time, ain't ya?
- Uh-huh, I sure am.
Oh, boy! This is the life, huh, Pinoky?
Yeah!
It sure is!
Ah, you smoke like me grandmother!
Come on, take a big drag like this.
Okay, Lampy.
Some fun, huh, kid?
Okay, Slats, your shot.
What's the matter, Slats?
Losin' your grip?
Pinocchio! So this is where I find you.
How do you ever expect to be a real boy?
Look at yourself. Smoking...
...playing pool! Ow! You are coming right home with me this minute!
Hey! Who's the beetle?
Let go! Put me down!
Let me out of here. Let me out!
He's my conscience. He tells me what's right and wrong.
What? You mean to tell me you take orders from a grasshopper?
Grasshopper? Look here, you, you impudent young pup!
It wouldn't hurt you to take orders from your grasshopp...
...your conscience, if you have one.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.
Screwball in the corner pocket.
Why... Why... Ya young hoodlum!
I'll... I'll knock your block off!
Why, I'll take you apart and put you back together.
Oh, don't hurt him, Jiminy.
He's my best friend.
Why, I'll... Your best friend?
And what am I?
Just your conscience.
Okay, that settles it.
- But, Jiminy...
- You buttered your bread, now sleep in it.
Ha-ha-ha!
Go on, laugh.
Make a jackass out of yourself.
I'm through! This is the end.
But, Jiminy, Lampwick says a guy only lives once.
Lampwick. Hmph!
Come on, come on.
Let him go.
Lampwick. Hmph, Lampwick!
Burns me up. After all
I tried to do for him.
Who's his conscience anyway?
Me or that, that hoodlum Lampwick?
I've had enough of this.
I'm taking the next boat out of here.
Open up that door!
Open up!
I wanna go home!
Come on, you blokes!
Keep 'em moving!
Lively there now.
We haven't got all night.
Where'd all the donkeys come from?
Come on, come on.
Let's have another.
And what's your name?
Okay, you'll do!
In you go!
You boys'll bring a nice price.
All right, next!
- And what might your name be?
- Alexander.
Hmm, so you can talk.
Ye-Yes, sir. I wanna go home to my mama!
Take him back!
He can still talk!
Please, please!
I don't wanna be a donkey!
- Let me outta here!
- Quiet!
You boys have had your fun.
Now pay for it.
"Boys"? So that's what...
Pinocchio!
Ha! To hear that beetle talk...
...you'd think somethin' was going to happen to us.
Conscience. Nah, phooey!
Where does he get that stuff?
"How do you ever expect to be a real boy?"
What's he think
I look like, a jackass?
You sure do!
Hey, you laugh like a donkey.
Did that come out of me?
Oh!
Huh?
What the...
What's goin' on?
I've been double-crossed!
Help! Help!
Somebody, help!
I've been framed! Help!
Please, you gotta help me.
Oh, be a pal.
Call that beetle!
Call anybody!
Mama! Mama!
- Oh, what's happened?
- I hope I'm not too late.
What'll I do?
- Pinocchio!
- Jiminy! Oh, Jiminy, help!
Wait, Pinoke! The kids, the boys, they're all donkeys!
Oh, you too!
Come on, quick!
Before you get any worse.
This way, Pinoke.
It's the only way out.
Hurry up... before they see us.
You gotta jump!
Jiminy.
Jiminy, y-you all right?
Sure. I thought we'd never make it.
Certainly feels good to be back on...
...dry land.
Come on, let's get home.
Father! Father, I'm home!
- We're home, Mr Geppetto! Home again!
- It's me, Pinocchio!
- I'm home to stay!
- Here he is, Mr Geppetto. Home at last.
Hey, maybe he's asleep.
Father! Father, it's me!
Pinoke, come here.
Look. He ain't here.
He... He's gone.
Yeah, and Figaro.
And Cleo too.
Maybe something awful happened to him.
Don't worry, son, he probably hasn't gone far.
Hey.
- It's a message.
- What's it say?
- It's about your father.
- Where is he?
Why, uh, uh, it says here he, uh...
...he went looking for you and, uh, uh, he was swallowed by a whale.
- Swallowed by a whale?
- Yeah, uh-huh. A... A whale?
- A whale named Monstro.
- Oh, he's...
But, but wait.
He's alive.
- Alive? Where?
- Why, uh, uh...
...inside the whale at the, at the bottom of the sea.
- Bottom of the sea?
- Uh-huh. Uh... Hey! Where you going?
I'm going to find him.
But, Pinoke, are you crazy?
Don't you realize, uh, he's in a whale?
I've gotta go to him.
Hey, Pinoke, wait!
Listen here, son.
But this Monstro,
I've heard of him.
He's a whale of a whale.
Why, he swallows whole ships alive.
Tie it good and tight now.
And besides, it's dangerous.
- Why, I...
- Bye, Jiminy.
Goodbye? I may be live bait down there, but I'm with ya.
Come on, let's go.
Look out below!
Gangway, down there.
Gee, what a big place.
- Come on, Jiminy.
- All right.
Soon as I take on some ballast.
One side, sister.
Well, so long.
Hmm, put it in the wrong end.
Hmph, no more privacy than a goldfish.
Ooh, chilly.
Father!
Father!
Hey, Pinoke, wait for me!
Father!
Father! Huh, he ain't my father.
Mr Geppetto!
Hey, what the...
Hey, le... let go!
Run along, ya little... squirt.
What's the matter? Can't a fellow, uh... I was only...
We were only looking for Monstro.
That got 'em.
Father!
Father!
Oh, hello.
Oh! Uh...
...can you tell me where we can find Monstro?
Gee, they're scared.
Uh, pardon me, pearl...
...are you acquainted with Monstro the whale?
Whoa, hold it there.
Father!
One side there, son.
Come on, boys, break it up.
Break it up now.
Hey, what the...
Whoa, quit, quit, quit shoving now.
Quit, whoa. Don't crowd.
Now take it easy. Take it easy there.
Whoa-ho-ho there. Whoa!
Steady there, Nellie.
Go ahead, Pinoke, ask them.
Could any of you tell me where to find Monstro?
Whoa! Whoa, boy!
Whoa, whoa! Hey!
Uh, sakes alive.
Father!
- Father!
- Mr Geppetto!
Not a bite for days.
We can't hold out much longer.
I never thought...
...it would end this way, Figaro.
Starving to death...
...in the belly of a whale.
My poor little Pinocchio.
He was such a good boy.
It's hopeless, Figaro.
There isn't a fish left.
If the monster doesn't wake up soon, I...
I'm afraid we...
We are done for.
Here they come!
Tuna! Oh, tuna fish!
Food! We'll eat!
Here's a big one!
Keep them in there, Figaro!
Hey! Wait a minute!
Ha-Have you seen...
Monstro!
We got to get out of here!
Come on, Pinoke.
Don't wait for me.
Never saw so many!
Here's another one!
Enough for weeks!
Here's a big one.
Keep them in there, Figaro!
Hey, blubber mouth, open up!
I got to get in there!
Looks like the last of them.
Here's a big one.
Only a few left.
We got to work fast!
- Hey!
- Here's another one.
Hey, Father!
- Father!
- Don't bother me now, Pinocchio!
- Pinocchio!
- Father!
Pinocchio, my son!
- Hey, Father, here I am!
- Huh?
Oh, oh, yes!
Pinocchio, my boy!
- I... I'm so happy to see you!
- Me too, Father!
- Oops!
- Figaro! Ah, Figaro.
Cleo! Oh, Cleo!
- You're here too.
- Yes!
We are all together again!
- Oh, you, you are soaking wet.
- Yes, Father.
You, you mustn't catch cold.
- But I came to save you!
- You shouldn't have come down here.
- But, Father!
- But I'm awfully glad to see you.
Let me take your hat. Oh!
Pinocchio!
What's the matter?
- Those ears!
- Huh? Ears?
Oh, these.
Hah. Oh, that's nothing.
I got a tail too.
Pinocchio!
What's happened to you?
Well, I... I... I...
Oh, never mind now.
Old Geppetto has his little Woodenhead.
Nothing else matters.
I got to get in!
My pal's in there!
Come on, you big moose!
Open up, I tell ya...
Hey! Cut it out!
Oh, boy.
Beat it, you buzzards!
Get out? Oh, no, no, son.
I've tried every way.
Why, I, I even built a raft.
- A raft? That's it!
- Huh?
We'll take the raft, and when the whale opens its mouth...
No, no, no, no.
N-Now listen, son.
He only opens his mouth when he's eating.
Then everything comes in.
Nothing goes out.
- Oh.
- It's hopeless, Pinocchio.
Come. We make a nice fire and we cook some of the fish.
- A fire! That's it!
- Yes. And then we'll all eat again.
A great big fire!
Lots of smoke.
Smoke? Oh, yeah, sure.
A smoked fish will taste good.
- Quick, some wood.
- Pinocchio, not the chair!
Hurry, Father. More wood!
Oh, what will we sit on if we...
We won't need it.
We're getting out!
Getting out?
But how?
- We'll make him sneeze!
- Make him sneeze?
Ohh, that will make him mad.
Well, it's about time!
- It won't work!
- Hurry, Father! Climb aboard!
- We'll never get by those teeth!
- Yes, we will!
Hey, which way you going?
Wait for me!
Hang on! Here we go!
Gesundheit.
- We're going back!
- No, we'll make it! Faster, faster!
It's no use!
We're done for!
We made it!
Look! Now he is mad!
I told you he'd be furious!
- He's gone!
- Where did he go?
Look out!
Hang on!
He's coming back.
Hurry!
He's trying to kill us!
Paddle, son!
Let's go back!
Look out! Jump!
Father! Father!
Oh, Father!
Pinocchio, swim for shore.
Swim for shore.
Hang on, Father!
Save... yourself.
Pinocchio...
...save yourself.
Don't mind me, son.
Save yourself, Pinocchio.
Pinocchio?
Oh, Pinocchio!
Pinocchi...
My boy.
My brave little boy.
Prove yourself brave, truthful and unselfish...
...and someday you will be a real boy.
Awake, Pinocchio.
Awake.
Father!
Whatcha crying for?
'Cause... you are dead,
Pinocchio.
No! No, I'm not.
Yes, yes, you are.
Now, lie down.
But, Father, I'm alive. See?
And... And I'm, uh...
I'm... I'm real.
I'm a real boy!
You're alive!
And, and you are a real boy!
- Yea! Whoopie!
- A real live boy!
This calls for a celebration!
Professor, lots of music!
Well! Huh. Th-This is practically where I came in.
Thank you, milady.
He deserved to be a real boy.
And it sure was nice of you to...
Huh? Wha... Uh... Wh... Wh...
Well, I'll be!
My, my!
Solid gold too.
Oh, I think it's swell!
When your heart is in your dream
No request
Is too extreme
When you wish
Upon a star
Your dreams come true
You'll find your dreams come true
Put that away.  
We've gotta get Lang alive. 
Hello, Barnett? 
This is Pete at Lang's place.   
Dr. Lang just drove out with Billy Batson.  
They took the Mill Valley Road. 
Mill Valley Road? All right.
I'll head 'em off.  
Mill Valley Road.   
Can't you go any faster?
I'll run him off the road.   
Billy! Billy!   
[ Coughs ]  
There's-- There's been an accident.
So I see.   
Are you hurt?   
No, but my companion, he's unconscious.   
We'll be glad to take him along too.  
Our orders were to get Lang, but the Scorpion will be glad to get Batson too. 
Now if you'll-- if you'll take me to--  
We know where to take you.  
Get in. 
Wh-What do you mean?
I said get in!  
The Scorpion!   
Yes, Dr. Lang, the Scorpion.   
It's a pleasure to see you here.
Please, be seated.  
Billy Batson was with him, so I brought him along. 
Splendid.   
Where's Batson? 
Downstairs under guard. 
He's unconscious.   
I'll attend to him when 
I finish with Dr. Lang. 
What do you want of me? 
Your lens to help complete the golden scorpion atom smasher.   
That's something I--
I'll never give you.
I think I can change your mind.   
Barnett, prepare to loosen  
Dr. Lang's tongue.  
Are you going to talk now, Dr. Lang?  
 Yes! Yes!  
 Anything you wish! 
Release him, Barnett.   
Where's your lens?  
In my library.  
There's a painting. 
 Behind the painting,   
 there's-- there's a safe.  
Write down the combination. 
Get the lens from Lang's safe at once.   
Yes, sir.   
Wait.   
Something should be done with Batson.
Do you want me to take care of him?
No. That's a pleasure   
I'm reserving for myself.   
I'll have him brought up. 
Wha-- What are you going to do with me?
Nothing, until I know your lens is where you say it is. 
[ Footsteps Approaching ]   
He hasn't come to yet.  
Well, get some water and bring him out of it.
Shazam! 
[ Screams ] 
Captain Marvel! 
Yes. Now I'll learn who you really are. 
And that gun of yours isn't going to stop me. 
But I think it will.
Dr. Lang will die if you come one step closer.
[ Rings ]   
Mr. Malcolm's secretary speaking.   
Who? Oh, Dr. Lang.  
- Let me talk to Malcolm.   
- Mr. Malcolm's out of town.
The Scorpion's men are after my lens.  
Can I be of any assistance? 
The safe in your library?   
Yes, that's right.  
It's in the alcove behind a painting.  
The combination is R-24--   
Now, Betty, repeat that combination to me. 
And then back to R-11.  
I'll start at once. 
Now, Betty, there's something   
I must warn you about.  
There's a death trap in the--
 [ Door Opens ] 
You're the Scorpion?
Dr. Lang! Dr. Lang! 
Betty-- Save her.   
Go to my house. 
Why?
Lens in my safe.
There's a death trap.   
Save her.   
Pete, we're gonna be busy inside. Understand?
Sure.   
Lock up the gates and keep out of sight.  
This must be it.
This is it! 
Open up those panels.   
Here's the combination. 
Right, 24.  
Shazam! 
Betty! Betty!   
Fix everything just the way you found it.   
And here's the combination. 
But he talked about some danger.
A matter of life or death, he said.
I think I know what he meant.  
There was a man with a gun as you drove up.
Really? Where is he?
He's been well taken care of. 
Let's go get that lens. 
He said it was in the alcove, didn't he?  
Yes, behind the painting.   
This is it. 
Read the combination to me. 
Right, 24.  
Left, 18.   
Right, nine.
Left, 16.   
Right, seven.   
Left, 10.   
And here's the last number: right, 11.
I owe everything to George Bailey.
Help him, dear Father.
Joseph, Jesus and Mary, help my friend Mr. Bailey.
Help my son George tonight.
He never thinks about himself, God.
That's why he's in trouble.
George is a good guy.
Give him a break, God.
I love him, dear Lord.
Watch over him tonight.
Please, God.
Something's the matter with Daddy.
Please bring Daddy back.
Please bring Daddy home.
Watch over him tonight.
Please bring Daddy back.
Hello, Joseph. Trouble?
Looks like we'll have to send someone down.
A lot of people asking for help for a man named George Bailey.
George Bailey?
Yes. Tonight's his crucial night.
You're right.
We'll have to send someone down immediately. Whose turn is it?
That's why I came to see you, sir.
It's that clockmaker's turn again.
Oh, Clarence.
Hasn't got his wings yet, has he?
We've passed him up right along.
Because, you know, sir, he's got the IQ of a rabbit.
Yes, but he's got the faith of a child. Simple.
Joseph, send for Clarence.
You sent for me, sir?
Yes, Clarence.
A man down on Earth needs our help.
Splendid. Is he sick?
No, worse. He's discouraged.
At exactly 10:45 p.m. Earth time, that man will be thinking seriously of throwing away God's greatest gift.
Oh, dear, dear, his life?
Then I've only an hour to dress.
What are they wearing now?
You will spend that hour getting acquainted with George Bailey.
Sir, if I should accomplish this mission,
I mean, might I perhaps win my wings?
I've been waiting for over 200 years now, sir, and people are beginning to talk.
What's that book you've got there?
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.
Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey and you'll get your wings.
Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you.
Poor George. Sit down.
Sit down? What are we...
If you're going to help a man, you want to know something about him, don't you?
Well, naturally, of course. I...
Now, keep your eyes open.
See the town?
Where? I don't see a thing.
Oh, I forgot.
You haven't got your wings yet.
Now, look, I'll help you out.
Concentrate.
Begin to see something?
Why, yes. This is amazing.
If you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself.
Oh, wonderful.
Yay! Yippee!
Okay, boys, let's go.
Hey, who's that?
That's your problem. George Bailey.
A boy?
That's him when he was 12 back in 1919.
Something happens here you'll have to remember later on.
Come on, Marty.
Let's go, Marty!
Attaboy, Marty.
Hee-haw!
Let's go, Sam. Hee-haw, Sammy!
Here comes the scare-baby, my kid brother Harry Bailey.
I'm not scared.
Come on, Harry.
Let's go, Harry!
Come on, Harry!
Come on, Harry!
- Come on, Harry!
- Come on, Harry!
Help, George, help!
Help!
Don't worry, Harry. I'm coming!
- Help!
- Hang on, Harry!
- Help.
- Make a chain, gang.
George saved his brother's life that day, but he caught a bad cold which infected his left ear.
Cost him his hearing in that ear.
It was weeks before he was able to go back to his after-school job at old man Gower's drugstore.
Mr. Potter.
Who's that, a king?
That's Henry F. Potter, the richest and meanest man in the county.
- Hee-haw! Hee-haw!
- Hee-haw! Hee-haw!
Go to work, slave.
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.
Wish I had a million dollars.
Hot dog!
It's me, Mr. Gower. George Bailey.
You're late.
Yes, sir.
Hello, George.
Hello, Mary.
Hello, Violet.
Two cents' worth of shoelaces?
She was here first.
I'm still thinking.
Shoelaces?
Please, Georgie.
I like him.
You like every boy.
What's wrong with that?
Here you are.
Help me down?
Help you down?
Made up your mind yet?
I'll take chocolate.
- With coconuts?
- I don't like coconuts.
You don't like coconuts?
Say, brainless, don't you know where coconuts come from?
Lookit here.
From Tahiti, the Fiji islands, the Coral Sea.
A new magazine. I never saw it before.
Of course you never.
Only us explorers can get it.
I've been nominated for membership in the National Geographic Society.
Is this the ear you can't hear on?
George Bailey,
I'll love you till the day I die.
I'm going out exploring someday.
You watch.
And I'm gonna have a couple of harems and maybe three or four wives.
Wait and see.
- George. George!
- Yes, sir?
You're not paid to be a canary.
No, sir.
Mr. Gower, do you want something?
Anything?
No.
- Anything I can do back here?
- No.
I'll get them, sir.
Quick, take those capsules over to Mrs. Blaine.
She's waiting for them.
Yes, sir.
They have the diphtheria there, haven't they, sir?
Yeah.
Is it a charge, sir?
Yes, George.
Mr. Gower, I...
- Oh, get going.
- Yes, sir.
Avast there, Captain Cook.
Where you heading?
- I've got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
- Some other time, George.
- It's important.
- There's a squall in there.
It's shaping up into a storm.
- Uncle Billy, telephone.
- Who is it?
- Bank examiner.
- Bank examiner?
I should have called him yesterday.
Switch it inside.
I'm not crying, Mr. Potter.
Well, you're begging.
That's a whole lot worse.
All I'm asking for is 30 days more.
- Pop.
- Just a minute, Son.
Just 30 short days.
I'll dig up that $5,000 somehow.
- Shove me up, shove me up.
- Pop.
- Just a minute.
- Have you put any real pressure on these people of yours to pay those mortgages?
Times are bad, Mr. Potter.
A lot of these people are out of work.
Well, then, foreclose.
I can't do that.
These families have children.
- Pop.
- They're not my children.
But they're somebody's children,
Mr. Potter.
Are you running a business or a charity ward?
- Well, all right...
- Not with my money.
Mr. Potter, what makes you such a hard-skulled character?
You have no family, no children.
You can't begin to spend all the money you've got.
I suppose I should give it to miserable failures like you and that idiot brother of yours to spend for me.
He's not a failure!
- You can't say that about my father.
- George, George. Quiet, George.
You're not.
You're the biggest man in town...
- Run along, run along.
- ...bigger than him,
- bigger than everybody.
- Gives you an idea of the Baileys.
Don't let him say that about you, Pop.
All right, Son. All right. Thanks.
I'll talk to you tonight.
What?
Why, that medicine should have been there an hour ago.
It will be over in five minutes,
Mrs. Blaine.
Where's Mrs. Blaine's box of capsules?
I... You...
Didn't you hear what I said?
Yes, sir. I...
What kind of tricks are you playing anyway?
Why didn't you deliver them right away?
Don't you know that boy's very sick?
You're hurting my sore ear.
You lazy loafer.
Mr. Gower, you don't know what you're doing.
You put something wrong in those capsules.
I know you're unhappy.
You got the telegram, and you're upset.
You put something bad in those capsules.
It wasn't your fault, Mr. Gower.
Just look and see what you did.
The bottle you took the powder from, it's poison.
I tell you, it's poison.
I know you feel bad.
- Oh!
- Don't hurt my sore ear again!
- Don't hurt my sore ear again.
- Oh, no, no. Oh, George, George.
Oh, Mr. Gower, I won't ever tell anyone.
I know how you're feeling.
I won't ever tell a soul.
Hope to die, I won't.
Oh, George. George.
An overnight bag.
Genuine English cowhide.
Combination lock.
- Fitted up with brushes, combs...
- Nope, nope, nope, nope.
Now, look, Joe. Now, look.
I want a big one.
What did you stop it for?
I want you to take a good look at that face.
Who is it?
George Bailey.
Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist?
That's the kid.
It's a good face. I like it.
I like George Bailey.
Tell me, did he ever tell anyone about the pills?
Not a soul.
Did he ever marry the girl?
Did he ever go exploring?
Well, wait and see.
Big, see? I don't want one for one night.
I want something for 1,001 nights with plenty of room here for labels from Italy and Baghdad, Samarkand.
Great big thing, about...
- I see. A flying carpet, huh?
- Yeah.
I don't suppose you'd like this old secondhand job, would you?
Now you're talking.
Gee whiz, I could use that as a raft in case the boat sunk.
- How much this cost?
- No charge.
That's my trick ear, Joe.
It sounded like you said "no charge."
That's right.
Well, what's my name doing on it?
A little present from old man Gower.
Came down and picked it out himself.
He did? What do you know about that?
My old boss. Isn't that nice?
What boat are you sailing on?
I'm working across on a cattle boat.
- A cattle boat?
- Okay, I like cows.
Hello, Mr. Gower. How are you?
Thanks ever so much for the baggage.
It's just exactly what I wanted.
Forget it.
- It's wonderful of you to think of me.
- Hope you enjoy it.
I wish I had a million dollars.
Hot dog!
Avast there, Captain Cook!
- You got your sea legs yet?
- Parlez-vous fran莽ais, mister?
Hey, send us some of those picture postcards, will you, George?
Hey, George, don't take any plug nickels.
Hey, George, your suitcase is leaking.
Hey, Ernie!
- Hi, Ernie. Hi, Bert.
- Hiya, George.
- George.
- Hey, I'm a rich tourist today.
How about driving me home in style?
- Hop in, Your Highness. Hop in.
- Yes, sir.
And for the carriage trade,
I put on my hat.
Good afternoon, Mr. Bailey.
Hello, Violet.
Hey, you look good.
That's some dress you got on there.
This old thing?
Why, I only wear it when I don't care how I look.
- How would you like to take...
- Yes.
Want to come along, Bert?
We'll show you the town.
No, thanks.
I think I'll go home and see what the wife's doing.
Family man.
George, Harry, you're shaking the house down.
Stop it.
Let them alone.
I wish I was up there with them.
But Harry will tear his dinner suit.
George!
That's why all children should be girls.
Well, if they were all girls there wouldn't be any... Oh, never mind.
George, Harry, come down to dinner this minute.
Everything's getting cold, and you know how long we've been waiting for you.
- Okay, Ma.
- Okay, Ma.
- Ta-da!
- Ta-da!
- We got a present for you, Pop.
- There you are.
Oh, you two idiots.
George, sit down and have dinner.
- Fine.
- I've eaten.
Well, aren't you gonna finish dressing for your graduating party? Look at you!
I don't care. It's George's tux.
Annie, my sweet, have you got those pies?
If you lay a hand on me,
I'll hit you with this broom!
Annie, I'm in love with you.
There's a moon out tonight.
Boy, oh boy, oh boy! My last meal in the old Bailey boarding house.
Oh, my lands, my blood pressure.
Pop, can I have the car? I gotta take over a lot of plates and things.
What plates?
Mom, I'm chairman of the Eats Committee.
We only need a couple of dozen.
Oh, no, you don't, Harry.
Now, not my best Haviland, no.
Oh, let him have the plates, Mother.
Hope you have a good trip, George.
Uncle Billy and I are gonna miss you.
I'm gonna miss you, too, Pop.
What's the matter? You look tired.
I had another tussle with Potter today.
I thought when we put him on the board of directors, he'd ease up on us a little bit.
What's eating that old money-grubbing buzzard anyway?
He's a sick man, frustrated, sick in his mind.
Sick in his soul, if he has one.
He hates everybody that has anything that he can't have.
He hates us mostly, I guess.
Gangway. Gangway.
- So long, Pop.
- So long.
- You got a match?
- Very funny, very funny.
Put those things in the car, and I'll get your tie and studs ready for you. Now, hurry up.
- Okay, Mom.
- Now, don't drop one of those.
You coming later, George?
What do you mean, and be bored to death?
Couldn't want a better death.
Lots of pretty girls, and we're gonna use that new floor tonight, too.
- I hope it works.
- No gin tonight, Son.
Oh, Pop, just a little?
No, Son. Not one drop.
Boys and girls and music.
Why do they need gin?
Did I act like that when I graduated from high school?
Pretty much.
You know, George, I wish we could send Harry to college with you.
Your mother and I talked it over half the night.
We have that all figured out.
You see, Harry will take my job at the Building and Loan, work there for four years, then he'll go.
Pretty young for that job.
Well, no younger than I was.
Well, you were born older, George.
How's that?
I said you were born older.
I suppose you've decided what you want to do when you get out of college.
Well, you know what I've always talked about, build things, design new buildings, plan modern cities.
All that stuff I've been talking about.
Still after that first million before you're 30?
I'll settle for half that in cash.
Of course, it's just a hope.
But you wouldn't consider coming back to the Building and Loan, would you?
Well, I... I...
Annie, why don't you draw up a chair?
Then you'd be more comfortable, and you could hear everything that's going on.
I would if I thought
I'd hear anything worth listening to.
You would, eh?
I know it's soon to talk about it.
No, now, Pop, I couldn't.
I couldn't face being cooped up for the rest of my life in a shabby little office.
I'm sorry, Pop. I didn't mean that, but I...
It's this business of nickels and dimes and spending all your life trying to figure out how to save three cents on a length of pipe.
I'd go crazy. I want to do something big and something important.
You know, George,
I feel that, in a small way, we're doing something important, satisfying a fundamental urge.
It's deep in the race for a man to want his own roof and walls and fireplace.
And we're helping him get those things in our shabby little office.
I know, Pop. I know that.
I wish I felt that...
I've been hoarding pennies like a miser here in order to...
Most of my friends have already finished college.
I just feel like if I didn't get away,
I'd bust.
Yes, yes, you're right, Son.
You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?
This town is no place for any man unless he's willing to crawl to Potter.
Now, you've got talent, Son. I've seen it.
You get yourself an education and get out of here.
Pop, you want a shock?
I think you're a great guy.
- Why, did you hear that, Annie?
- I heard it.
It's about time one of you lunkheads said it.
I'm gonna miss old Annie.
Pop, I think I'll get dressed and go over to Harry's party.
Have a good time, Son.
Excuse me.
There you are.
George, hello.
You know my kid brother George.
- I'm gonna put him through college.
- Hello, George.
Hee-haw!
Sam Wainwright.
How are you? When did you get here?
This afternoon.
I thought I'd give the kids a treat.
Old college graduate now.
Yeah, old "Joe College" Wainwright they call me.
Well, freshman, looks like you're gonna make it after all, huh?
- Harry, you're the guy I want to see.
- Hello, Sam.
- Coach has heard all about you.
- He has?
Yeah, he's followed every game, and his mouth's watering.
He wants me to find out if you're gonna come along with us.
Well, I got to make some dough first.
Well, you better make it fast.
We need great ends like you.
Not broken down old guys like this one.
Hee-haw!
George, welcome back.
Hello, Mr. Partridge, how are you?
Putting a pool under this floor was a great idea.
Saved us another building.
Now, Harry, Sam, have a lot of fun.
There's lots of stuff here to eat and drink. Lots of pretty girls around.
A third dance... A third...
- Hello, Violet.
- Hello. What am I bid?
George.
Marty! Well, it's old home week.
- Marty!
- Sam, Harry, how are you?
- Do me a favor, will you, George?
- What's that?
- You remember my kid sister Mary.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
"Mama wants you, Marty.
Mama wants you." Remember?
Dance with her, will you?
Oh, me? Well, I feel funny enough already with all these kids.
Come on, be a sport.
Just dance with her one time, and you'll give her the thrill of her life. Hey, Sis!
Don't be long, Marty.
I'm not being a wet nurse to a...
The next thing I knew, some guy came up and tripped me.
That's the reason why I came in fourth.
If it hadn't been for that, that race'd have been a cinch.
I tried to find out who it was later, but I couldn't find out.
Nobody'd ever tell you whoever it was, because they'd be scared.
'Cause they know what kind of a guy I am.
You remember George. This is Mary.
Well, I'll be seeing you.
Well, well, well.
Now to get back to my story, see?
Hey, this is my dance.
Why don't you stop annoying people?
Well, I'm sorry. Hey!
- Well, hello.
- Hello.
You look at me as if you didn't know me.
Well, I don't.
You've passed me on the street almost every day.
Me?
No. That was a little girl named Mary Hatch. That wasn't you.
Oh, yes! Oh, yes! Oh, yes!
The big Charleston contest!
The prize, a genuine loving cup.
Those not tapped by the judges will remain on the floor.
Let's go!
I'm not very good at this.
Neither am I.
Okay. What can we lose?
Hey, you're wonderful.
What's the matter, Othello? Jealous?
Did you know there's a swimming pool under this floor?
And did you know that button behind you causes this floor to open up?
And did you further know that George Bailey is dancing right over that crack?
And I've got the key.
Stand back, everybody! Stand back!
They're cheering us. We must be good.
Get out of there!
What... Oh, well.
~ Buffalo gals
can't you come out tonight? ~
~ Can't you come out tonight? ~
~ Can't you come out tonight? ~
~ Buffalo gals, can't you come out tonight ~
~ And dance ~
~ By the light ~
~ Of the moon ~
- Oh, hot dog. Just like an organ.
- Beautiful.
I told Harry I thought
I'd be bored to death.
You should have seen the commotion in that locker room.
I had to knock down three people to get this stuff we're wearing here.
Let me hold that old wet dress of yours.
Do I look as funny as you do?
I guess I'm not quite the football type.
You look wonderful!
You know, if it wasn't me talking,
I'd say you were the prettiest girl in town.
Well, why don't you say it?
I don't know. Maybe I will say it.
How old are you anyway?
Eighteen.
Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen.
Too young or too old?
Oh, no, no. Just right. Your age fits you.
Yes, sir, you look a little older without your clothes on.
I mean, without a dress you look older.
I mean younger. You look... You just...
I'm on the thing here.
Sir, my train, please.
A pox upon me for a clumsy lout.
Your caboose, milady.
You may kiss my hand.
Hey.
Hey, Mary.
As I was lumberin' down the street
Down the street, down the street
Okay, then. I'll throw a rock at the old Granville house.
Oh, no, don't. I love that old house.
No, you see, you make a wish and then try and break some glass.
And you got to be a pretty good shot nowadays, too.
Oh, no, George, don't.
It's full of romance, that old place.
I'd like to live in it.
In that place?
I wouldn't live in it as a ghost.
Now, watch.
Right in the second floor, there. See?
What did you wish, George?
Not just one wish, a whole hatful.
Mary, I know what
I'm gonna do tomorrow and the next day and next year and the year after that.
I'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet, and I'm gonna see the world!
Italy, Greece, the Parthenon, the Coliseum.
Then I'm coming back here and go to college to see what they know.
And then I'm gonna build things.
I'm gonna build airfields.
I'm gonna build skyscrapers
100 stories high.
I'm gonna build bridges a mile long.
What, are you gonna throw a rock?
Hey, that's pretty good.
What did you wish, Mary?
Buffalo gals can't you come out tonight?
Can't you come out tonight?
Can't you come out tonight?
Buffalo gals, can't you come out tonight
And
Dance by the light of the moon?
What did you wish when you threw that rock?
- Oh, no.
- Come on, tell me.
If I told you, it might not come true.
What is it you want, Mary?
What do you want? You want the moon?
Just say the word, and I'll throw a lasso around it and pull it down.
Hey, that's a pretty good idea.
I'll give you the moon, Mary.
I'll take it.
Then what?
Well, then you could swallow it, and it would all dissolve, see?
And the moonbeams would shoot out of your fingers and your toes and the ends of your hair.
- Am I talking too much?
- Yes!
Why don't you kiss her instead of talking her to death?
How's that?
Why don't you kiss her instead of talking her to death?
You want me to kiss her, huh?
Youth is wasted on the wrong people.
Hey. Hey, hold on, hey, mister.
Come on back out here!
I'll show you some kissing that'll put hair back on your head. What are you...
Mary?
Okay, I give up. Where are you?
Over here in the hydrangea bushes.
Here you are. Catch.
Wait a minute. What am I doing?
This is a very interesting situation.
Please give me my robe.
A man doesn't get in a situation like this every day.
I'd like to have my robe.
Not in Bedford Falls, anyway.
- Ouch! Oh!
- Gesundheit.
- George Bailey!
- This requires a little thought here.
Give me my robe.
I've read about things like this, but I've never...
Shame on you!
I'm gonna tell your mother on you.
My mother's way up on the corner there.
I'll call the police.
They're way downtown.
They'd be on my side, too.
Then I'm going to scream!
Maybe I could sell tickets.
Let's see. No, the point is in order to get this robe... I've got it.
I'll make a deal with you, Mary.
George! George!
George, come on home! Quick!
- Your father's had a stroke.
- What?
- Mary, Mary, I'm sorry. I've got to go.
- Come on, George, let's hurry.
- Did you get a doctor?
- Yes.
Campbell's there now.
I think that's all we'll need you for, George.
- I know you're anxious to make a train.
- I have a taxi waiting downstairs.
I want the board to know that George gave up his trip to Europe to help straighten things out here these past few months.
Good luck to you at school, George.
- Good luck, George.
- Goodbye, George.
And now we come to the real purpose of this meeting, to appoint a successor to our dear friend Peter Bailey.
Mr. Chairman,
I'd like to get to my real purpose.
- Wait just a minute now.
- Wait for what?
I claim this institution is not necessary to this town.
Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I make a motion to dissolve this institution and turn its assets and liabilities over to the receiver.
Potter, you dirty, contemptible...
I'll wring his neck.
George, did you hear what that buzzard...
Mr. Chairman.
It's too soon after Peter Bailey's death to talk about chloroforming the Building and Loan.
Peter Bailey died three months ago.
I second Mr. Potter's motion.
Very well. In that case,
I'll ask the two executive officers to withdraw. But before you go,
I'm sure the whole board wishes to express its deep sorrow
- at the passing of Peter Bailey.
- Thank you very much.
It was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this organization.
I'll go further than that.
I'll say that to the public
Peter Bailey was the Building and Loan.
That's fine, Potter, coming from you, considering that you probably drove him to his grave.
Peter Bailey was not a businessman.
That's what killed him.
Oh, I don't mean any disrespect to him.
God rest his soul.
He was a man of high ideals, so-called.
But ideals without common sense can ruin this town.
Now, you take this loan here to Ernie Bishop, you know, that fellow that sits around all day on his brains in his taxi, you know.
I happen to know the bank turned down this loan.
But he comes here, and we're building him a house worth $5,000.
- Why?
- Well, I handled that, Mr. Potter.
You have all the papers there.
His salary, insurance.
I can personally vouch for his character.
- A friend of yours?
- Yes, sir.
You see, if you shoot pool with some employee here, you can come and borrow money.
What does that get us?
A discontented, lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class.
And all because a few starry-eyed dreamers like Peter Bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas.
Now, I say...
Just a minute. Just a minute.
Now, hold on, Mr. Potter.
You're right when you say my father was no businessman. I know that.
Why he ever started this cheap penny-ante Building and Loan
I'll never know.
But neither you nor anybody else can say anything against his character, because his whole life was...
Why, in the 25 years since he and Uncle Billy started this thing, he never once thought of himself.
Isn't that right, Uncle Billy?
He didn't save enough money to send Harry to school, let alone me.
But he did help a few people get out of your slums, Mr. Potter.
And what's wrong with that?
Why, here, you're all businessmen here.
Don't it make them better citizens, and doesn't it make them better customers?
You said that they...
What'd you say just a minute ago?
They had to wait and save their money before they even thought of a decent home.
Wait? Wait for what?
Until their children grow up and leave them?
Until they're so old and broken-down that they...
Do you know how long it takes a working man to save $5,000?
Just remember this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble you're talking about, they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community.
Well, is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath?
Anyway, my father didn't think so.
People were human beings to him, but to you, a warped, frustrated old man, they're cattle.
Well, in my book, he died a much richer man than you'll ever be.
I'm not interested in your book.
I'm talking about the Building and Loan.
I know very well what you're talking about.
You're talking about something you can't get your fingers on, and it's galling you.
That's what you're talking about, I know.
Well, I've said too much. I...
You're the Board here.
You do what you want with this thing.
There's just one thing more, though.
This town needs this measly one-horse institution if only to have someplace where people can come without crawling to Potter.
Come on, Uncle Billy.
Sentimental hogwash. I want my motion.
Boy, oh boy, that was telling him,
George, old boy.
You shut his big mouth.
You should have heard him.
What happened?
We heard a lot of yelling.
Well, we're being voted out of business after 25 years.
- Easy come, easy go.
- Here it is. "Help wanted. Female."
You still want me to hang around, George?
- Yeah, I'll be right down.
- Yeah, hey, you'll miss your train.
You're a week late for school already.
Go on.
- What's going on in there?
- Never mind. Don't worry about that.
They're putting us out of business.
So what? I can get another job.
- I'm only 55.
Go on, go on.
Hey, look, you gave up your boat trip, now you don't want to miss college, too, do you?
George! George!
They voted Potter down.
They want to keep it going.
You did it, George. You did it.
They got one condition, only one condition.
- What's that?
- And that's the best part of it.
They've appointed George here as Executive Secretary to take his father's place.
- Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy...
- You can keep him on. That's all right.
As Secretary, you can hire anyone you like.
Dr. Campbell, now let's get this thing straight. I'm leaving.
I'm leaving right now.
I'm going to school.
This is my last chance.
Uncle Billy here, he's your man.
But, George, they'll vote with Potter otherwise.
- I know, I know, he didn't go.
- That's right.
Not only that, but he gave his school money to his brother, Harry, and sent him to college.
Harry became a football star.
Made second team all-American.
Yeah, but what happened to George?
George got four years older, waiting for Harry to come back and take over the Building and Loans.
There are plenty of jobs around for somebody that likes to travel.
Look at this. Here.
Venezuela oil fields. "Wanted, man with construction experience."
Here's the Yukon, right here.
"Wanted, man with engineering experience."
There she blows.
You know what the three most exciting sounds in the world are?
Breakfast is served.
Lunch is served. Dinner...
No, no, no, no! Anchor chains, plane motors and train whistles.
- Peanut?
- There's the professor now.
Old Professor Phi Beta Kappa all-American Bailey.
Why, old George
"Geographic Explorer" Bailey.
What? No husky dogs? No sled?
Uncle Billy, you haven't changed a bit.
Nobody ever changes here, you know that.
Oh, am I glad to see you.
- Say, where's Mother?
- She's home, cooking the fatted calf.
- Come on, let's go.
- Oh, wait! Wait, wait a minute.
George, Uncle Billy,
I want you to meet Ruth.
- Hello.
- How do you do?
- Ruth Dakin.
- Ruth Dakin Bailey, if you don't mind.
- Huh?
- Well, I wired you I had a surprise.
Here she is. Meet the wife.
Well, what do you know? A wife.
- Well, how do you do? Congratulations.
- How do you do?
What am I doing? Congratulations!
- Doggone it, Harry, you...
- They're married!
Why don't you tell somebody?
Come on, Mrs. Bailey,
I can't wait to see everybody's reaction.
- You're really married?
- Why, yes.
What's a pretty girl like you doing marrying this two-headed brother of mine?
Well, I'll tell you. It's purely mercenary.
My father offered him a job.
Oh, he got you and the job?
Well, Harry's cup runneth over.
George, about that job. Ruth spoke out of turn. I never said I'd take it.
You've been holding the bag here for four years, and, well, I won't let you down, George.
I would like to...
Oh, wait a minute. I forgot the bags.
I'll be right back.
It was a surprise to me.
This is the new Mrs. Bailey, my nephew's wife.
- How are you?
- Old, old friend of the Baileys.
Oh, really? What are their names?
Let's see...
Oh, of course,
I've heard him speak of you.
And I want to tell you, we're gonna give the biggest party this town ever saw.
Here, have some popcorn.
George, George, George.
That's all Harry ever talks about.
Ruth, this...
What about this job?
Well, my father owns a glass factory in Buffalo.
He wants to get Harry started in the research business.
- Well, is it a good job?
- Oh, yes, very.
Not much money, but good future, you know.
- Yeah.
- Harry's a genius at research.
- My father just fell in love with him.
- And you did, too.
Hey, Joe.
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.
I feel so good.
I could spit in Potter's eye.
I think I will. I think I will.
What did you say? Huh?
Maybe I'd better go home.
Where's my hat? Where's my...
- Oh, thank you, George. Which is mine?
- The middle one.
Oh, thank you, George.
Oh boy, oh boy. Now, look, if you'll point me in the right direction...
Would you do that, George?
Right down here.
Old Building and Loan pal, huh?
Now you just turn this way and then right straight down there.
Oh, that way, huh?
~ My wild Irish rose ~
I'm all right. I'm all right.
~ The sweetest flower I know ~
Hello, Ma.
That's for nothing.
- How do you like her?
- She's swell, isn't she?
Looks like she can keep Harry on his toes.
Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway.
Did you know that Mary Hatch is back from school?
Came back three days ago.
Nice girl, Mary.
Kind that'll help you find the answers, George.
Stop that grunting.
Can you give me one good reason why you shouldn't call on Mary?
Sure. Sam Wainwright.
- Hee-haw?
- Yes, Sam's crazy about Mary.
- Well, she's not crazy about him.
- Well, how do you know?
- What, did she discuss it with you?
- No.
- Well, then how do you know?
- Well, I've got eyes, haven't I?
Why, she lights up like a firefly whenever you're around.
Besides,
Sam Wainwright's away in New York,
- and you're here in Bedford Falls.
- And all's fair in love and war.
I don't know about war.
Mother of mine, I can see right through you right to your back-collar button.
Trying to get rid of me, huh?
Well, here's your hat.
What's your hurry?
All right, Mother, old Building and Loan pal,
I think I'll go out and find a girl and do a little passionate necking.
Oh, George.
Now, if you'll just point me in the right direction...
This direction.
Good night, Mrs. Bailey.
- Excuse me.
- Now, wait a minute.
I think I got a date.
But stick around, fellows, just in case, huh?
We'll wait for you, baby.
- Hello, Georgie Porgie!
- Hello Vi.
- What gives?
- Nothing.
Where are you going?
Oh, I'll probably end up down at the library.
Georgie, don't you ever get tired of just reading about things?
Yes.
- What are you doing tonight?
- Not a thing.
Are you game, Vi?
Let's make a night of it.
I'd love it, Georgie. What'll we do?
Let's go out in the fields and take off our shoes
- and walk through the grass.
- Huh?
Then we can go up to the falls.
It's beautiful up there in the moonlight, and there's a green pool up there, and we can swim in it.
Then we can climb Mount Bedford and smell the pines and watch the sunrise against the peaks, and we'll stay up there the whole night, and everybody'll be talking.
There'll be a terrific scandal.
Georgie, have you gone crazy?
Why, walk in the grass in my bare feet?
Why it's 10 miles up to Mount Bedford.
- If you think...
- Okay, just forget about the whole thing.
- What are you doing, picketing?
- Hello, Mary.
I just happened to be passing by here.
Yes, so I noticed.
- Have you made up your mind?
- How's that?
- Have you made up your mind?
- About what?
About coming in.
Your mother just phoned and said you were on your way over
- to pay me a visit.
- My mother just called you?
Well, how did she know?
- Didn't you tell her?
- I didn't tell anybody.
I just went for a walk and happened to be passing by here.
What do you...
Went for a walk. That's all.
- I'll be downstairs, Mother.
- All right, dear.
Well, are you coming in or aren't you?
Well, I'll come in for a minute.
But I...
I didn't tell anybody
I was coming over here, you know.
- When did you get back?
- Tuesday.
Where did you get that dress?
- Do you like it?
- It's all right.
I thought you would go back to New York, like Sam and Angie and the rest of them.
I worked there a couple of vacations, but I don't know.
I guess I was homesick.
Homesick? For Bedford Falls?
Yes, and my family and...
Everything.
Would you like to sit down?
All right, for a minute.
I still can't understand it, though.
You know, I didn't tell anybody
I was coming here.
Would you rather leave?
No. I don't want to be rude.
Well, then, sit down.
What's that?
Some joke, huh?
Well...
I see it still smells like pine needles around here.
Thank you.
And dance by the
What's the matter?
Oh. Oh, yeah, yeah.
Well...
Nice about your brother Harry and Ruth, isn't it?
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's all right.
Don't you like her?
Well, of course I like her.
She's a peach.
Oh, just marriage in general you're not enthusiastic about, huh?
No. Marriage is all right for Harry and Marty and Sam and you.
Mary! Mary!
Who's down there with you?
It's George Bailey, Mother.
George Bailey? What's he want?
I don't know.
What do you want?
Me? Not a thing.
I just came in to get warm.
He's making violent love to me, Mother.
You tell him to go right back home, and don't you leave the house, either!
Sam Wainwright promised to call you from New York tonight.
What's your mother mean?
You know, I didn't come here to...
- What did you come here for, then?
- I don't know. You tell me.
You're supposed to be the one that has all the answers. You tell me.
- Why don't you go home?
- That's where I'm going.
I don't know why I came here in the first place.
- Good night.
- Good night!
Mary! Mary! The telephone. It's Sam.
I'll get it.
Whatever were you doing that you couldn't hear?
Mary, he's waiting.
Hello?
Forgot my hat.
Hee-haw! Hello, Sam, how are you?
I'm great.
Gee, it's good to hear your voice again.
Well, that's awfully sweet of you, Sam.
There's an old friend of yours here.
George Bailey.
You mean old mossback George?
Yes, old mossback George.
Hee-haw! Put him on.
Wait just a minute. I'll call him. George!
He doesn't want to speak to George, you idiot.
He does so. He asked for him.
George, Sam wants to speak to you.
Hi, Sam.
Well, George Baileyoffski!
Hey, a fine pal you are.
What're you trying to do, steal my girl?
What do you mean?
Nobody's trying to steal anybody's girl.
Here... Here's Mary.
No, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I want to talk to both of you.
Tell Mary to get on the extension.
- Mother's on the extension. We...
- I am not!
We can both hear. Come here.
We're listening, Sam.
Well, look, I have a big deal coming up that's gonna make us all rich.
George, do you remember that night in Martini's bar when you told me you'd read someplace about making plastics out of soybeans?
- Chili beans.
- Shut up, will you?
You remember, out of chili...
Out of soybeans.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Soybeans, yeah.
Well, listen, Dad snapped up the idea, and he's gonna build a factory outside of Rochester.
How do you like that?
Rochester? Well, why Rochester?
Well, why not?
Can you think of anything better?
Well, I don't know.
Just why not right here?
You remember that old tool and machinery works?
You tell your father he can get that for a song.
And all the labor he wants, too.
Half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down.
That so? Well, I'll tell him.
Hey, that sounds great.
Oh, baby, I knew you'd come through.
Now here's the point, Mary.
Mary, you're in on this, too.
Now listen. Have you got any money?
Money? Yeah... Well, a little.
Well, now, listen.
I want you to put every cent you've got into our stock, do you hear?
And, George, I may have a job for you, that is unless you're still married to that broken-down Building and Loan.
Well, this is the biggest thing since radio, and I'm letting you in on the ground floor.
Oh, Mary. Mary?
I'm here.
Would you tell that guy
I'm giving him the chance of a lifetime, do you hear?
The chance of a lifetime!
He says it's the chance of a lifetime.
Now you listen to me.
I don't want any plastics, and I don't want any ground floors.
And I don't want to get married, ever, to anyone.
You understand that?
I want to do what I want to do.
And you're... And you're...
- Oh, Mary, Mary.
- George, George, George.
Oh, Mary.
Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
Mary...
Here they come! Here they come!
Goodbye, George!
Goodbye!
First Harry, now George.
Annie, we're just two old maids now.
You speak for yourself, Miss B.
If either of you two see a stranger around here, it's me.
Hey, look.
There's somebody driving this cab.
Bert the cop sent this over.
He said to float away to Happyland on the bubbles.
Oh, look at this. Old Bert. Champagne!
By the way, where are you two going on this here now honeymoon?
Where are we going? Look at this.
There's the kitty, Ernie.
Here, come on, count it, Mary.
I feel like a bootlegger's wife. Look.
You know what we're gonna do?
We're gonna shoot the works.
A whole week in New York.
A whole week in Bermuda.
The highest hotels, the oldest champagne, the richest caviar, the hottest music and the prettiest wife.
That does it! Then what?
- Then what, honey?
- After that, who cares?
That does it, come here. Come here.
Don't look now, but there's something funny going on over there at the bank, George.
I've never really seen one, but that's got all the earmarks of being a run.
Hey, Ernie, if you got any money in the bank, you better hurry.
George, let's not stop. Let's go!
Just a minute, dear.
- Please, let's not stop, George.
- I'll be back in a minute, Mary.
Well, hello, everybody.
Mrs. Thompson, how are you?
Charlie? What's the matter here, can't you get in?
What is this, Uncle Billy? A holiday?
George.
Come on in, everybody.
That's right. Just come on in.
Look out, you.
Now, look, why don't you all sit down?
There are a lot of seats over there.
Just make yourselves at home.
George, can I see you a minute?
- Why didn't you call me?
- I just did, but they said you left.
This is a pickle, George.
This is a pickle.
All right, now, what happened?
How did it start?
How does a thing like this ever start?
- All I know is the bank called our loan.
- When?
About an hour ago.
I handed over all our cash.
- All of it?
- Every cent of it,
- and still it was less than we owe them.
- Holy mackerel!
And then I got scared, George, and closed the doors.
I... I...
The whole town's gone crazy.
Yeah, hello?
George, it's Potter.
Hello?
George, there is a rumor around town that you've closed your doors.
Is that true?
Oh, well, I'm very glad to hear that.
George, are you all right?
Do you need any police?
Police? What for?
Well, mobs get pretty ugly sometimes, you know.
George, I'm going all out to help in this crisis.
I've just guaranteed the bank sufficient funds to meet their needs.
They'll close up for a week and then reopen.
He just took over the bank.
I may lose a fortune, but I'm willing to guarantee your people, too.
Just tell them to bring their shares over here, and I will pay 50 cents on the dollar.
You never miss a trick, do you, Potter?
Well, you're gonna miss this one.
If you close your doors before 6:00 p.m., you will never reopen.
George, was it a nice wedding?
Gosh, I wanted to be there.
Yeah.
You can take this one off now.
Now, just remember that this thing isn't as black as it appeared.
I have some news for you, folks.
I was just talking to old man Potter, and he's guaranteed cash payments at the bank.
The bank's gonna reopen next week.
But, George, I got my money here.
Did he guarantee this place?
Well, no, Charlie. I didn't even ask him.
We don't need Potter over here.
Then, I'll take mine now.
No, but you're...
You're thinking of this place all wrong, as if I had the money back in a safe.
The money's not here.
Well, your money's in Joe's house.
That's right next to yours.
And in the Kennedy house and Mrs. Macklin's house and 100 others.
Why, you're lending them the money to build, and then, they're gonna pay it back to you as best they can.
Now, what are you gonna do, foreclose on them?
I got $242 in here, and $242 isn't going to break anybody.
Okay, Tom. All right.
Here you are. You sign this.
You'll get your money in 60 days.
Sixty days?
Now, that's what you agreed to when you bought your shares.
- Tom! Tom, did you get your money?
- No.
Well, I did.
Old man Potter'll pay 50 cents on the dollar for every share you've got.
- Fifty cents on the dollar!
- Yes, cash!
Well, what do you say?
Now, Tom, you have to stick to your original agreement.
Now, give us 60 days on this.
- Okay, Randall.
- Are you going to go to Potter's?
Better to get half than nothing.
Tom! Tom!
Randall! Now, Randall, wait! Wait.
Now, listen. Now, listen to me.
I beg of you not to do this thing.
If Potter gets a hold of this Building and Loan, there'll never be another decent house built in this town.
He's already got charge of the bank.
He's got the bus line.
He got the department stores.
And now he's after us. Why?
Well, it's very simple.
Because we're cutting in on his business, that's why.
And because he wants to keep you living in his slums and paying the kind of rent he decides.
Joe, you had one of those Potter houses, didn't you?
Well, have you forgotten?
Have you forgotten what he charged you for that broken-down shack?
Here, Ed, you know. You remember last year when things weren't going so well and you couldn't make your payments.
Well, you didn't lose your house, did you?
You think Potter would've let you keep it?
Can't you understand what's happening here?
Don't you see what's happening?
Potter isn't selling.
Potter's buying, and why?
Because we're panicky and he's not.
That's why.
He's picking up some bargain.
Now we can get through this thing all right.
We've got to stick together, though.
We've got to have faith in each other.
But my husband hasn't worked in over a year, and I need money.
How am going to live until the bank opens?
- I got doctor bills to pay.
- I need cash.
I can't feed my kids on faith.
How much do you need?
Hey! I got $2,000.
Here's $2,000.
This'll tide us over till the bank reopens.
- All right, Tom, how much do you need?
Tom, just enough to tide you over until the bank reopens.
I'll take $242.
- There you are.
- That'll close my account.
Your account's still here. That's a loan.
- Okay. All right, Ed?
- I got $300 here, George.
Now, Ed, what'll it take till the bank opens? What do you need?
Well, I suppose $20.
$20. Now you're talking.
Thanks, Ed. That's fine.
All right, now, Mrs. Thompson, how much do you want?
But it's your own money, George.
Never mind about that.
How much do you want?
- I can get along with $20, all right.
- $20, fine.
- And I'll sign the paper.
- You don't have to sign anything.
I know you. You pay it when you can.
That's okay.
- All right, Mrs. Davis?
- Could I have $17.50?
Bless your heart. Of course you can have it. You got 50 cents?
- Seven...
- We're gonna make it, George.
...five, four, three, two, one, bingo!
We made it! Close the door, Eustace!
We made it.
Look, look, we're still in business.
We've still got 2 bucks left.
Look, let's have some of that.
Let's celebrate!
Get some glasses, Tilly.
- Well, a couple of financial wizards.
- Call us Rockefellers.
Get a tray for these two great big important simoleons here.
We'll save them for seed. A toast.
A toast. A toast to Mama Dollar and to Papa Dollar, and if you want to keep this old
Building and Loan in business, you better have a family real quick.
- I wish they were rabbits.
- I wish they were, too.
Okay, let's put them in the safe and see what happens.
Close the door.
Folks, folks, wedding cigars.
Wedding. Holy mackerel, I'm married.
Where's Mary? Mary! Poor...
Look, I got a train to catch.
Well, the train's gone.
I wonder if Ernie's still here with his taxicab.
George, there's a call for you.
Look, will you get my wife on the phone?
She's probably over at her mother's.
Mrs. Bailey is on the phone.
I don't want Mrs. Bailey. I want my wife.
Mrs. Bailey! Oh, that's my wife.
Here, I'll take it in here.
Mary. Hello. Listen, dear, I'm sorry.
Huh? Come home? What home?
320 Sycamore? Well, what...
Whose home is that?
The Waldorf Hotel, huh?
Hey, this is the company's posters, and the company won't like this.
How would you like to get a ticket next week?
You got any romance in you?
- Sure, I had it, but I got rid of it.
- Liver pills.
Who wants to see liver pills on their honeymoon?
What we want is romantic places, beautiful places, places George wants to go.
Hey, Bert. Here he comes.
Come on, we got to get this up.
He's coming.
- Who?
- The groom, idiot.
This is their honeymoon.
Come on. Get that ladder.
What are they, ducks?
- Get that ladder up here.
- All right, all right.
- Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up.
- I'm hurrying.
Hiya... Good evening, sir.
Entree, Monsieur.
Entree.
~ Islands of Hawaii ~
~ Where skies of blue are calling me ~
~ Where balmy air and golden moonlight ~
~ caress the waving palms of Waikiki ~
Welcome home, Mr. Bailey.
Well, I'll be ...
Mary, where did you ...
~ I Love You Truly ~
~ Truly, Dear ~
~ Life with It's Shadows ~
Oh, Mary ...
~ Life with It's Tears ~
Remember the night we broke the windows in this old house?
~ Fade into Dreams ~
This is what I wished for.
~ When I Feel You Are Near ~
Darling, you're wonderful.
~ I Love You Truly ~
~ Truly, Dear ~
- Martini, you rented a new house?
- Rent?
- You hear what he say, Mr. Bailey?
- What's that?
I own the house.
Me, Giuseppe Martini,
I own my own house.
No more we live like a pigs in this Potter's Field.
- Mary, Mary!
- Mary, come on, bring the baby.
I feel like a queen.
- I'll take the kids in the car.
- Oh, thank you, Mr. Bailey. Thank you.
All right, kids, here. Here, get in here.
Now, one at a time.
Get right up on the seat there.
- Sit down, there.
- Here, now, get the dog, now. That's it.
- Goat, too.
- Everybody!
All in!
Bye-bye! Bye-bye!
All in?
Mr. and Mrs. Martini, welcome home.
Good old George, he's always making a speech.
Hee-haw!
- Sam Wainwright.
- Oh, who cares.
Bread. That this house may never know hunger.
Salt. That life may always have flavor.
And wine. That joy and prosperity may reign forever.
Enter the Martini castle.
Look, Mr. Potter, it's no skin off my nose.
I'm just your little rent collector.
But you can't laugh off this Bailey Park anymore.
Look at it.
Congressman Black is here to see you, sir.
Oh, tell the Congressman to wait.
Go on.
Fifteen years ago, a half a dozen houses stuck here and there.
There's the old cemetery, squirrels, buttercups, daisies.
I used to hunt rabbits there myself.
Look at it today.
Dozens of the prettiest little homes you ever saw,
90% owned by suckers who used to pay rent to you.
Your Potter's Field, my dear
Mr. Employer, is becoming just that.
And are the local yokels making with those David and Goliath wisecracks.
Oh, they are, are they?
Even though they know the Baileys never made a dime out of it.
You know very well why.
The Baileys were all chumps.
Every one of these homes is worth twice what it cost the Building and Loan to build.
- If I were you, Mr. Potter...
- You are not me.
As I say, it's no skin off my nose, but one of these days this bright young man is gonna be asking
George Bailey for a job.
The Bailey family has been a boil on my neck long enough.
- Yes, sir?
- Come in here.
We just stopped in town to take a look at the new factory, and then we're gonna drive on down to Florida.
Why don't you have your friends join us?
Why, sure. Hey, why don't you kids drive down with us, huh?
Oh, I'm afraid I couldn't get away, Sam.
Still got the nose to the old grindstone, eh?
Jane, I offered to let George in on the ground floor in plastics, and he turned me down cold.
- Oh, now, don't rub it in.
- I'm not rubbing it in.
Well, I guess we better run along.
- Awfully happy to have met you, Mary.
- Nice meeting you, too.
- Goodbye. Glad to see you.
- Goodbye, George.
So long, George.
See you in the funny papers.
- So long, Mary.
- Bye, Sam. Have fun.
- Thanks for dropping around.
- Florida!
- Hee-haw!
- Hee-haw.
Thank you, sir.
- That's quite a cigar, Mr. Potter.
- You like it?
I'll send you a box.
Well, I...
I suppose I'll find out sooner or later, but just what exactly did you want to see me about?
George, now that's just what I like so much about you.
George, I am an old man, and most people hate me.
But I don't like them, either, so that makes it all even.
You know just as well as I do that I run practically everything in this town but the Bailey Building and Loan.
You know, also, that for a number of years I've been trying to get control of it.
Or kill it. But I haven't been able to do it.
You have been stopping me.
In fact, you have beaten me, George, and as anyone in this county can tell you, that takes some doing.
Take during the Depression, for instance.
You and I were the only ones that kept our heads.
You saved the Building and Loan.
I saved all the rest.
Yes. Well, most people say you stole all the rest.
The envious ones say that,
George, the suckers.
Now, I have stated my side very frankly.
Now let's look at your side.
Young man, 27-28, married, making, say, $40 a week.
Out of which, after supporting your mother and paying your bills, you're able to keep, say, $10, if you skimp.
A child or two comes along, and you won't even be able to save the $10.
Now, if this young man of 28 was a common, ordinary yokel,
I'd say he was doing fine.
But George Bailey is not a common, ordinary yokel.
He is an intelligent, smart, ambitious young man, who hates his job, who hates the Building and Loan almost as much as I do.
A young man who's been dying to get out on his own ever since he was born.
A young man... The smartest one of the crowd, mind you.
A young man who has to sit by and watch his friends go places because he's trapped.
Yes, sir, trapped into frittering his life away, playing nursemaid to a lot of garlic eaters.
Do I paint a correct picture, or do I exaggerate?
- Now, what's your point, Mr. Potter?
- My point?
- My point is I want to hire you.
- Hire me?
Yeah, I want you to manage my affairs, run my properties.
George, I'll start you out at $20,000 a year.
$20,000 a year?
You wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town, buying your wife a lot of fine clothes, a couple of business trips to New York a year, maybe once in a while Europe.
You wouldn't mind that, would you, George?
Would I?
You're not talking to somebody else around here, are you?
You know, this is me.
You remember me?
- George Bailey.
- George Bailey.
Yeah, George Bailey, whose ship has just come in.
Provided he has enough brains to climb aboard.
Holy mackerel.
Well, how about the Building and Loan?
Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success?
I'm offering you a three-years contract at $20,000 a year, starting today.
Is it a deal, or isn't it?
Well, Mr. Potter, I...
I know I ought to jump at the chance but I... I just...
I wonder if it would be possible for you to give me 24 hours to think it over?
Sure, sure, sure.
You go on home and talk about it to your wife.
I'd like to do that.
Yeah. In the meantime,
I'll draw up the papers.
- All right, sir.
- Okay, George?
Okay, Mr. Potter.
No. No. No, no, now wait a minute, here.
I don't need 24 hours.
I don't have to talk to anybody.
I know right now, and the answer is no.
No, doggone it!
You sit around here, and you spin your little webs, and you think the whole world revolves around you and your money.
Well, it doesn't, Mr. Potter.
In the whole vast configuration of things,
I'd say you were nothing but a scurvy little spider.
You...
And that goes for you, too!
And it goes for you, too!
You wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town, buying your wife a lot of fine clothes, going to New York on a business trip a couple of times a year, maybe Europe once in a while.
I know what I'm gonna do tomorrow and the next day and next year and the year after that.
I'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet, and I'm gonna see the world.
And then I'm gonna build things.
I'm gonna build air fields.
I'm gonna build skyscrapers
100 stories high.
I'm gonna build a bridge a mile long.
What is it you want, Mary?
What, you want the moon?
If you do, just say the word,
I'll throw a lasso around it and pull her down for you.
Buffalo gal
Won't you come out tonight?
Won't you come out tonight?
Won't you come out tonight?
Buffalo gal
Won't you come out tonight
And
- Hi.
- Hi.
Mary Hatch, why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me?
To keep from being an old maid.
You could have married Sam Wainwright and anybody else in town.
I didn't want to marry anybody else in town.
I want my baby to look like you.
You didn't even have a honeymoon.
I promised you...
- Your what?
- My baby.
Your... Your...
Mary, you on the nest?
- George Bailey lassoes stork.
- Lassoes a stork!
You mean you...
What is it, a boy or a girl?
Now, you've probably already guessed that George never leaves Bedford Falls.
- No!
- Mary had her baby, a boy.
Then she had another one, a girl.
Day after day she worked away, remaking the old Granville house into a home.
Night after night,
George came back late from the office.
Potter was bearing down hard.
Then came a war.
Ma Bailey and Mrs. Hatch joined the Red Cross and sewed.
Mary had two more babies but still found time to run the USO.
Sam Wainwright made a fortune in plastic hoods for planes.
Potter became head of the draft board.
One-A.
One-A.
One-A.
Gower and Uncle Billy sold war bonds.
Bert the cop was wounded in North Africa, got the Silver Star.
Ernie the taxi driver parachuted into France.
Marty helped capture the Remagen Bridge.
Harry...
Harry Bailey topped them all.
A Navy flier, he shot down 15 planes, two of them as they were about to crash into a transport full of soldiers.
- Yes, but George.
- George?
Four-F on account of his ear,
George fought the battle of Bedford Falls.
Now, hold on! Hold on! Hold on now!
Don't you know there's a war on?
Air raid warden.
Paper drives.
Scrap drives.
Rubber drives.
Like everybody else on VE Day, he wept and prayed.
On VJ Day, he wept and prayed again.
Joseph, now show him what happened today.
Yes, sir.
This morning, day before Christmas, about 10:00 a.m.
Bedford Falls time...
Hey, Ernie. Look at that.
It's gonna snow again.
What do you mean, it's gonna snow?
Look at the headlines. The President...
I know, I know, George.
That's marvelous.
Commander Harry Bailey!
Mr. Gower, look at this, the second page.
Now, look, this is for you.
- This is for you. That's for you.
- Okay.
- Right, thanks.
- See you again.
Be sure you spell the name right.
Extra! Read all about it!
George, George! It's Harry now on long-distance from Washington.
Harry! What do you know about that!
He reversed the charges.
It's okay, isn't it?
Reversed the charges?
Of course it is for a hero.
Harry!
You old seven times a son of a gun. Congratulations.
How's Mother standing it? She did?
What do you know?
Mother had lunch with the President's wife.
Wait till Martha hears about this.
- What did they have to eat?
- What'd they have to eat?
Harry, you should see what they're cooking up in the town for you.
Oh, they are?
The Navy's gonna fly Mother home this afternoon.
In a plane?
What? Uncle Billy?
- Has Uncle Billy come in yet?
- He stopped at the bank first.
He's not here right now, Harry.
But look, now, tell me about it.
- George. George, George.
- What?
- That man is here again.
- What man?
Bank examiner.
Harry, talk to Eustace for a minute, will you?
I'll be right back.
- Well...
- Harry.
- Good morning, sir.
- Carter, bank examiner.
- Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
We're all excited around here.
My brother just got the Congressional Medal of Honor.
- The President just decorated him.
- Well, I guess they do those things.
- Well, I trust you had a good year.
- Good year?
Well, between you and me,
Mr. Carter, we're broke.
Yeah, very funny.
Well, now, come right in here, Mr. Carter.
Although I shouldn't wonder when you okay reverse charges on personal long-distance calls.
- George, shall we hang up?
- No, no.
He wants to talk to Uncle Billy.
You just hold on, there.
Now, if you'll cooperate,
I'd like to finish with you by tonight.
I want to spend Christmas in Elmira with my family.
I don't blame you at all, Mr. Carter.
Just step right in here. We'll fix you up.
December 24.
- Merry Christmas, Mr. Potter.
- Merry Christmas.
Well, good morning, Mr. Potter.
What's the news?
Well, well, well, "Harry Bailey wins Congressional Medal."
That couldn't be one of the Bailey boys.
You just can't keep those Baileys down, now can you, Mr. Potter?
How does slacker George feel about that?
Very jealous. Very jealous.
He only lost three buttons off his vest.
Of course, slacker George would've gotten two of these medals if he had gone.
- Bad ear.
- Yes.
After all, Potter, some people like George had to stay at home.
Not every heel was in Germany and Japan.
- Good morning, Mr. Bailey.
- Good morning, Horace.
- I guess you forgot something.
- Huh?
- You forgot something.
- What?
Well, aren't you going to make a deposit?
Oh, sure, sure I am.
Well, then, it's usually customary to bring the money with you.
Oh, shucks, I knew I had.
How about that finger there?
Well, I...
Bailey.
Take me back there. Hurry up.
Come on, look sharp.
Take me back.
Just make yourself at home, Mr. Carter.
I got those books for you here.
Oh, hello, Vi.
George, can I see you for a second?
Why, of course you can.
Go on in the office there.
Uncle Billy, talk to Harry.
He's on the telephone.
Hurry up, Uncle Billy, hurry.
Long distance, Washington.
Hey, here's Harry on the phone.
You know, your nephew, remember? Harry.
- Here he is.
- Hurry up.
Hello? Hello.
Yes, Harry, yes, everything's fine.
I ought to have my head examined.
$8,000. It's got to be somewhere.
Here you are.
Character?
If I had any character, I'd...
It takes a lot of character to leave your hometown and start all over again.
No, George, don't.
Here now, you're broke, aren't you?
- I know, but...
- What do you want to do, hock your furs and that hat?
You want to walk to New York?
You know, they charge for meals and rent up there, just the same as they do in Bedford Falls.
- Yeah, sure.
- No, that's a loan, now.
That's my business, Building and Loan.
Besides, you'll get a job.
Good luck to you.
I'm glad I know you, George Bailey.
- Say hello to New York for me.
- Yeah, yeah, sure, I will.
Now, let's hear from you once in a while.
- Merry Christmas, Vi.
- Merry Christmas, George.
- Mr. Bailey.
- Oh, Mr. Carter, I'm sorry.
I'll be right with you.
Uncle Billy in there?
Yeah, he's in his office.
What's going on?
The bank examiner's here.
- He's here?
- Yeah. He wants the accounts payable...
What's the matter with you?
Come here.
Eustace.
- Yeah?
- Come here a minute.
Did you see Uncle Billy with any cash last night?
He had it on his desk counting it before he closed up.
Now, look, did you buy anything?
- Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.
- All right, all right.
Now, we'll go over every step you took since you left the house.
- Right. This way.
- Come on.
And did you put the envelope in your pocket?
Yeah, maybe, maybe.
Maybe! I don't want any maybe.
We've got to find that money!
- I'm no good to you, George.
- Uncle Billy, look, do you realize what's going to happen if we don't find it?
Listen to me.
Do you have any secret hiding place here in the house?
Someplace you would have...
Someplace you hide the money?
I've gone over the whole house, even in rooms that have been locked since I lost Laura.
Listen to me, listen to me! Think, think!
I can't think anymore, George.
I can't think anymore. It hurts.
Where's that money, you silly, stupid old fool?
Where's that money?
Do you realize what this means?
It means bankruptcy and scandal and prison!
That's what it means.
One of us is going to jail.
Well, it's not going to be me.
Hello, darling.
- Hello, Daddy.
- Hello, Daddy.
How do you like it?
- Bless you!
- Bless you!
Did you bring the wreath?
Yes, Daddy, did you bring the Christmas wreath?
What wreath?
The Merry Christmas wreath for the window.
No. I left it at the office.
- Is it snowing?
- Yeah, it just started.
- Where's your coat and hat?
- Left them at the office.
What's the matter?
Nothing's the matter.
Everything's all right.
Come on, Pete, you're a big boy.
You can help me get this star up.
Way up at the top. There. That's it.
All right, fill in that little bare spot right there. Right there.
Isn't it wonderful about Harry?
We're famous, George.
Bet I had 50 calls today about the parade, the banquet.
Your mother's so excited. She...
Must she keep playing that?
I have to practice it for the party tonight, Daddy.
Mama said we could stay up till midnight and sing Christmas carols.
Can you sing, Daddy?
Better hurry and shave.
- The families will be here soon.
- Families.
I don't want the families over here.
Come on out in the kitchen with me while I finish dinner.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Have a hectic day?
- Oh, yeah.
Another big red-letter day for the Baileys.
Daddy, the Browns next door have a new car. You should see it.
Well, what's the matter with our car?
Isn't it good enough for you?
Yes, Daddy.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Excuse you for what?
- I burped.
All right, darling, you're excused.
Now, go on upstairs and see if little Zuzu wants anything.
- Zuzu? What's the matter with Zuzu?
- Oh, she's just got a cold. She's in bed.
Caught it coming home from school.
They gave her a flower for a prize, and she didn't want to crush it, so she didn't button up her coat.
- What is it, a sore throat or what?
- It's just a cold.
- The doctor says it's nothing serious.
- The doctor?
- Was the doctor here?
- Yes, I called him right away.
He says it's nothing to worry about.
Is she running a temperature?
What is it?
Just a teensy one, 99.6.
She'll be all right.
Of course, it's this old house.
I don't know why we don't all have pneumonia.
Drafty old barn.
Might as well be living in a refrigerator.
Why did we have to live here in the first place and stay around this measly, crummy old town?
- George, what's wrong?
- Wrong! Everything's wrong.
You call this a happy family?
Why do we have to have all these kids?
- Dad, how do you spell "frankincense"?
- I don't know. Ask your mother.
- Where're you going?
- I'm going up to see Zuzu.
He told me to write a play for tomorrow.
F-r-a-n-k-i-n...
Hi, Daddy!
- Well, what happened to you?
- I won a flower.
Wait now.
Where do you think you're going?
I want to give my flower a drink.
All right, all right.
Now, give Daddy the flower.
I'll give it a drink.
Now, here.
Look, Daddy!
Paste it!
Yeah, all right, all right. Give it here.
Now, we'll paste this together here.
There. There it is. Good as new.
Now, give the flower a drink.
Now, will you do something for me?
- What?
- Will you try to get some sleep?
I'm not sleepy.
I want to look at my flower.
I know, I know, but you just go to sleep and then you can dream about it, and it'll be a whole garden.
It will?
- Telephone!
- Telephone!
I'll get it.
Hello?
Yes, this is Mrs. Bailey.
Oh, thank you, Mrs. Welch.
I'm sure she'll be all right.
The doctor said that she ought to be out of bed in time to have her Christmas dinner.
- Is that Zuzu's teacher?
- Yes.
Let me speak to her.
Hello. Hello, Mrs. Welch?
This is George Bailey. I'm Zuzu's father.
Say, what kind of a teacher are you, anyway?
What do you mean sending her home like that, half naked?
Do you realize she'll probably end up with pneumonia on account of you?
- George!
- Is this the sort of thing we pay taxes for to have teachers like you?
Stupid, silly, careless people who send our kids home without any clothes on?
You know, maybe my kids aren't the best-dressed kids.
And maybe they don't have any decent clothes...
That stupid...
Hello, Mrs. Welch. I want to apologize...
Hello? Hello.
- She's hung up!
- I'll hang her up!
- Hey, you! I'll knock your block off!
- What is that?
Hello! Who's this?
Oh, Mr. Welch?
Okay, that's fine, Mr. Welch.
Give me a chance to tell you what I really think of your wife.
George, stop it.
Will you get out and let me handle this?
Hello? Hello? What?
Oh, you will, huh?
Okay, Mr. Welch. Any time you think you're man enough, you...
Hello! Any...
Dad, how do you spell "hallelujah"?
How should I know?
What do you think I am, a dictionary?
Tommy, stop that! Stop it!
Janie, haven't you learned that silly tune yet?
You play it over and over again.
Now stop it! Stop it!
I'm sorry, Mary.
Janie, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that. I...
You go on and practice.
Pete, I owe you an apology, too.
I'm sorry.
- What do you want to know?
- Nothing, Daddy.
What's the matter with everybody?
Janie, go on. I told you to practice.
Now, go on, play!
Oh, Daddy!
George, why must you torture the children? Why don't you...
Mary...
Bedford 247, please.
- Is Daddy in trouble?
- Yes, Pete.
- Shall I pray for him?
- Yes, Janie, pray very hard.
- Me, too?
- You, too, Tommy.
Hello? Uncle Billy?
I'm in trouble, Mr. Potter.
I need help.
Through some sort of an accident, my company's short in their accounts.
The bank examiner got there today.
I've got to raise $8,000 immediately.
Oh, that's what the reporters wanted to talk to you about?
- The reporters?
- Yes.
They called me up from your Building and Loan.
Oh, there's a man over there from the D.A.'s office, too.
He's looking for you.
Please help me, Mr. Potter.
Help me, won't you, please?
Can't you see what it means to my family?
I'll pay any sort of a bonus on the loan, any interest, if you still want the Building and Loan...
George, could it possibly be there's a slight discrepancy in the books?
No, sir.
There's nothing wrong with the books.
I've just misplaced $8,000.
I can't find it anywhere.
- You misplaced $8,000?
- Yes, sir.
- Have you notified the police?
- No, sir. I didn't want the publicity.
- Harry's homecoming tomorrow...
- They're going to believe that one.
What've you been doing, George?
Playing the market with the company's money?
No, sir. No, sir, I haven't.
Is it a woman, then?
You know, it's all over town that you've been giving money to Violet Bick.
What?
Not that it makes any difference to me, but why did you come to me?
Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright and ask him for the money?
I can't get a hold of him. He's in Europe.
Well, what about all your other friends?
They don't have that kind of money,
Mr. Potter. You know that.
You're the only one in town that can help me.
I've suddenly become quite important.
What kind of security would I have, George?
- Have you got any stocks?
- No, sir.
Bonds? Real estate?
Collateral of any kind?
I have some life insurance, a $15,000 policy.
- Yes. How much is your equity in it?
- Five hundred dollars.
Five hundred dollars?
And you ask me to lend you $8,000?
Look at you. You used to be so cocky.
You were going to go out and conquer the world.
You once called me a warped, frustrated old man.
What are you but a warped, frustrated young man?
A miserable little clerk, crawling in here on your hands and knees and begging for help.
No securities, no stocks, no bonds.
Nothing but a miserable little $500 equity in a life insurance policy.
You're worth more dead than alive.
Why don't you go to the riffraff you love so much and ask them to let you have $8,000?
You know why?
Because they'd run you out of town on a rail.
But I tell you what I'm going to do for you, George.
Since the state examiner is still here, as a stockholder of the Building and Loan,
I'm going to swear out a warrant for your arrest.
Misappropriation of funds, manipulation, malfeasance.
All right, George, go ahead.
You can't hide in a little town like this.
Yeah, Bill? This is Potter.
Merry Christmas! Glad you come!
How about some of that good spaghetti?
We got everything.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Dear Father in Heaven,
I'm not a praying man, but if you're up there and you can hear me, show me the way.
I'm at the end of my rope. I...
Show me the way, O God.
Are you all right, George?
Want somebody to take you home?
Why you drink so much, my friend?
Please go home, Mr. Bailey.
This is Christmas Eve.
Bailey? Which Bailey?
This is Mr. George Bailey.
The next time you talk to my wife like that, you'll get worse!
She cried for an hour!
It isn't enough she slaves teaching your stupid kids how to read and write,
- and you have to bawl her out.
- You get out of here, Mr. Welch!
Now, wait, I want to pay for my drink.
Never mind the money!
You get out of here quick!
- All right!
- You hit my best friend! Get out!
- You all right, George?
- Who was that?
He gone. No worry. He name is Welch.
- He no come into my place no more.
- Oh, Welch.
That's what I get for praying.
The last time he come in here.
You hear that, Nick?
Yes, you bet.
Where's my insurance policy?
Oh, here it is.
Oh, no, please, don't go this way, Mr. Bailey.
- I'm all right.
- No, no, you no feel so good.
- Sit down and rest.
- I'm all right.
Please no go away, please!
What do you think you're doing?
Now look what you did.
My great-grandfather planted this tree!
Hey, you! Hey, you!
Come back here, you drunken fool!
Get this car out of here!
Hey, what's the matter with you?
Look where you're going.
Help!
Help! Help!
Help! Help!
Help!
Help! Help! Help! Help!
Help! Help!
I didn't have time to get some stylish underwear.
Wife gave me this on my last birthday.
I passed away in it.
Oh, Tom Sawyer's drying out, too.
You should read the new book
Mark Twain's writing now.
How did you happen to fall in?
I didn't fall in.
I jumped in to save George.
You what? To save me?
Well, I did, didn't I?
You didn't go through with it, did you?
- Go through with what?
- Suicide.
It's against the law to commit suicide around here.
Yeah, it's against the law where I come from, too.
- Where do you come from?
- Heaven.
I had to act quickly.
That's why I jumped in.
I knew if I were drowning, you'd try to save me.
You see, you did, and that's how I saved you.
Very funny.
Your lip's bleeding, George.
Yeah, I got a bust in the jaw in answer to a prayer a little bit ago.
Oh, no, no, no, George,
I'm the answer to your prayer.
That's why I was sent down here.
- How'd you know my name?
- Oh, I know all about you.
I've watched you grow up from a little boy.
What are you, a mind reader or something?
No.
- Well, who are you then?
- Clarence Oddbody, AS2.
Oddbody?
AS2? What's that, AS2?
Angel Second Class.
Cheerio, my good man.
Oh, brother.
Gee whiz.
I wonder what Martini put in those drinks.
Hey, what's with you?
What did you say just a minute ago?
Why'd you want to save me?
That's what I was sent down for.
I'm your guardian angel.
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
Ridiculous of you to think of killing yourself for money, $8,000.
Yeah, now, just things like that...
How do you know that?
I told you. I'm your guardian angel.
I know everything about you.
Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get.
Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you?
What happened to your wings?
I haven't won my wings yet.
That's why I'm an Angel Second Class.
I don't know whether I'd like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings.
Oh, I've got to earn them, and you'll help me, won't you?
Sure, sure.
- How?
- By letting me help you.
Yes. Only one way you can help me.
You don't happen to have
8,000 bucks on you, do you?
Oh, no. No.
We don't use money in heaven.
Oh, yeah, that's right, I keep forgetting.
- Comes in pretty handy down here, bub.
- Oh, tut, tut, tut.
I found it out a little late.
I'm worth more dead than alive.
Now, look, you mustn't talk like that.
I won't get my wings with that attitude.
You just don't know all that you've done.
If it hadn't been for you...
Yeah, if it hadn't been for me, everybody'd be a lot better off.
My wife and my kids and my friends.
I mean, look, little fellow, go off and haunt somebody else, will you?
No, now, you don't understand.
I've got my job...
Oh, shut up, will you?
Oh, this isn't gonna be so easy.
Yeah, so you still think killing yourself would make everyone feel happier, eh?
Well, I don't know. I guess you're right.
I suppose it would have been better if I'd never been born at all.
- What'd you say?
- I said I wish I'd never been born.
Oh, you mustn't say things like that.
You... Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
That's an idea.
What do you think?
Yeah, that'll do it.
All right.
You've got your wish.
You've never been born.
You don't have to make all that fuss about it!
What did you say?
You've never been born. You don't exist.
You haven't a care in the world.
No worries, no obligations, no $8,000 to get, no Potter looking for you with the Sheriff.
- Say something else in that ear.
- Sure, you can hear out of it.
Well, that's the doggonedest thing.
I haven't heard anything out of that ear since I was a kid.
Must have been that jump in that cold water.
Your lip stopped bleeding, too, George.
What do you know about that?
What's happening?
It stopped snowing out here, didn't it?
What's happened here?
What I need is a couple of good stiff drinks.
How about you, Angel?
You want a drink?
Come on, soon as these clothes of ours are dry...
The clothes are dry.
What do you know about that?
Stove's hotter than I thought.
Now, come on, get your clothes on.
We'll stroll up to my car and get...
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll stroll. You fly.
I can't fly. I haven't got my wings.
You haven't got your wings.
Yeah, that's right.
What's the matter?
Well, this is where I left my car, and it isn't here.
- You have no car.
- Well, I had a car, and it was right here.
I guess somebody moved it.
- Good evening.
- Oh, say, hey, where's my car?
- I beg your pardon?
- My car, my car.
I'm the fellow that owns the car that ran into your tree.
- What tree?
- What do you mean, what tree?
This tree. Here, I ran into it.
Cut a big gash in the side of it there.
You must mean two other trees.
You had me worried.
One of the oldest trees in Pottersville.
Pottersville?
Why, you mean Bedford Falls.
I mean Pottersville.
Don't you think I know where I live?
What's the matter with you?
What's the matter with me?
Well, I guess I just...
Oh, I don't know.
Either I'm off my nut or he is or you are.
It isn't me.
Well, maybe I left the car up at Martini's.
- Well, come on, Gabriel.
- Clarence.
Clarence. Clarence.
That's all right. Go on in.
Martini is a friend of mine.
There's a place to sit down. Sit down.
- Oh, hello, Nick. Hey, where's Martini?
- Want a martini?
No, no, Martini. Your boss.
Where is he?
Hey, look, I'm the boss.
You want a drink or don't you?
Okay, all right. Double bourbon, will you, and quick, huh?
Okay.
- What's yours?
- I was just thinking.
It's been so long since I...
Look, mister, I'm standing here waiting for you to make up your mind.
That's a good man.
I was just thinking of a flaming rum punch.
No, it's not cold enough for that, not nearly cold enough.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I got it.
Mulled wine, heavy on the cinnamon and light on the cloves.
Off with you, me lad, and be lively!
Hey, look, mister, we serve hard drinks in here for men who want to get drunk fast.
And we don't need any characters around to give the joint atmosphere.
Is that clear, or do I have to slip you my left for a convincer?
What's he talking about?
Nick, Nick, just give him the same as mine.
- He's okay.
- Okay.
What's the matter with him?
I never saw Nick act like that before.
You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
Oh, yeah.
Hey, little fellow, you worry me, you know.
- You got someplace to sleep?
- No.
You don't, huh?
- Well, you got any money?
- No.
No wonder you jumped in the river.
I jumped in the river to save you so I could get my wings.
- Somebody's just made it.
- Made what?
Every time you hear a bell ring, it means that some angel's just got his wings.
Look, I think maybe you better not mention getting your wings around here.
Why? Don't they believe in angels?
Yeah, they believe in them.
Oh, why should they be surprised when they see one?
Oh, he never grew up. He's...
- How old are you anyway, Clarence?
- Two hundred and ninety-three, next May.
That does it. Out, you two pixies!
Go through the door or out the window.
- Look, Nick, what's wrong?
- Now, that's another thing.
Where do you come off calling me Nick?
Well, Nick, that's your name.
What's that got to do with it?
I don't know you from Adam's off ox.
Hey. Hey, you rummy, there.
Come here, come here.
Didn't I tell you never to come panhandling around here, huh?
Mr. Gower.
Mr. Gower.
What... What did...
Mr. Gower, look, this is George Bailey.
- Don't you know me?
- No.
No.
Throw him out. Throw him out.
Mr. Gower! Hey, what is...
Hey, Nick. Nick.
Isn't that Mr. Gower, the druggist?
You know, that's another reason for me not to like you.
That rum head spent 20 years in jail for poisoning a kid.
If you know him, you must be a jailbird yourself.
Would you show these gentlemen to the door?
Sure. This way, gentlemen.
Stay out.
Get me! I'm giving out wings!
You see, George, you were not there to stop Gower from putting that poison into the capsules.
What do you mean, I wasn't there?
I remember distinctly...
Hey, what's going on around here?
What...
Why, this ought to be Martini's place.
Look, who are you?
I told you, George.
I'm your guardian angel.
Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that.
What else are you?
What, are you a hypnotist?
No. Of course not.
Well, then, why am I seeing all these strange things here?
Don't you understand, George?
It's because you were not born.
- Well, if I wasn't born, who am I?
- You're nobody. You have no identity.
What do you mean, no identity?
My name's George Bailey.
There is no George Bailey.
You have no papers, no cards, no driver's license, no 4-F card, no insurance policy.
They're not there, either.
- What?
- Zuzu's petals.
You've been given a great gift, George, a chance to see what the world would be like without you.
Now, wait a minute here.
Wait a minute here.
This is some sort of a funny dream
I'm having.
So long, mister. I'm going home.
- Home? What home?
- Shut up! Cut it out!
You're crazy!
That's what I think. You're screwy.
You're driving me crazy, too.
I'm seeing things here.
I'm going home and see my wife and family.
You understand that?
And I'm going home alone.
How am I doing, Joseph?
Thanks.
No, I didn't have a drink.
Hey, hey, where did the Building and Loan move to?
Building and what?
The Bailey Building and Loan.
It was up there.
They went out of business years ago.
That sailor's a liar!
I know every big shot in this town!
I know Potter, and I'll have you kicked off the beat.
Hey, Violet!
Hey, hey! Listen. That's Violet Bick.
- I know.
- I know that girl!
Take a walk. Beat it.
Hey, Ernie! Ernie.
Ernie, take me home.
I'm going off my nut.
Where do you live?
Now, doggone it, Ernie, don't you start pulling that stuff.
You know where I live. 320 Sycamore.
Now hurry up.
- All right. 320 Sycamore?
- Yeah, yeah, hurry up. Zuzu's sick.
- Come on.
- All right. All right.
Come on, Ernie, now straighten me out here.
Look, I've got some bad liquor or something. Listen to me.
Now, you are Ernie Bishop, and you live in Bailey Park with your wife and kid?
- That's right, isn't it?
- You seen my wife?
Seen your wife?
I've been to your house 100 times.
Look, bud, what's the idea?
I live in a shack in Potter's Field, my wife ran away three years ago and took the kid, and I ain't never seen you before in my life, see?
Okay, well, just step on it.
Just get me home!
- Is this the place?
- Of course it's the place.
Well, this house ain't been lived in for 20 years.
- What's up, Ernie?
- I don't know.
But we better keep our eye on this guy.
He's bats.
Mary. Mary!
Tommy! Pete! Janie! Zuzu!
Where are you?
They're not here, George.
You have no children.
Where are they?
What have you done with them?
All right, put up your hands.
No fast moves.
Come on out here, both of you.
- Bert! Thank heaven you're here.
- Back this.
Bert, what's happened to this house?
Where's Mary? Where's my kids?
- Watch him, Bert.
- Come on, come on.
Bert, Ernie.
What's the matter with you two guys?
You were here on my wedding night.
You, both of you, stood out there on the porch
- and sung to us, don't you remember?
- Think I'd better be going.
Look, now, why don't you be a good kid, and we'll take you in to a doctor?
- Everything's gonna be all right.
- Bert, no, listen to me.
Ernie, will you take me over to my mother's house?
Bert, listen. It's that fellow here.
He says he's an angel.
- He's trying to hypnotize me.
- I hate to do this to you, bud, but...
Run, George! Run, George! Run!
- Joseph! Help! Help!
- Oh, shut up.
Oh, Joseph! Joseph!
Where'd he go? Where'd he go?
I had him right here.
I need a drink.
Well, which way did he go?
Help me find him.
Well?
Mother.
Mother? What do you want?
Mother, this is George.
I thought sure you'd remember me.
George who?
If you're looking for a room, there's no vacancy.
Mother, listen. Please help me.
Something terrible's happened to me.
I don't know what it is.
Something's happened to everybody.
Please let me come in, and keep me here until I get over it.
Get over what? I don't take in strangers unless they're sent here by somebody I know.
Well, I know everybody you know.
Your brother-in-law, Uncle Billy.
- You know him?
- Well, sure I do.
- When did you see him last?
- Today over at his house.
It's a lie.
He's been in the insane asylum ever since he lost his business.
And if you ask me, that's where you belong.
Strange, isn't it?
Each man's life touches so many other lives.
And when he isn't around, he leaves an awful hole, doesn't he?
I've heard of things like this.
You got me in some kind of a spell or something.
Well, I'm gonna get out of it.
I'll get out of it.
I know how, too. I...
The last man I talked to, before all this stuff started happening to me, was Martini.
You know where he lives?
Well, sure, I know where he lives.
He lives in Bailey Park.
- Are you sure this is Bailey Park?
- No, I'm not sure of anything anymore.
All I know is this should be Bailey Park.
- But where are the houses?
- You weren't here to build them.
Your brother Harry Bailey broke through the ice and was drowned at the age of nine.
That's a lie. Harry Bailey went to war.
He got the Congressional
Medal of Honor.
He saved the lives of every man on that transport.
Every man on that transport died.
Harry wasn't there to save them, because you weren't there to save Harry.
You see, George?
You really had a wonderful life.
Don't you see what a mistake it would be to throw it away?
- Clarence.
- Yes, George?
- Where's Mary?
- Oh, well, I can't...
I don't know how you know these things, but tell me, where is she?
If you know where she is, tell me where my wife is.
- I'm not supposed to tell.
- Please, Clarence, tell me where she is.
- You're not gonna like it, George.
- Where is she?
She's an old maid. She never married.
Where is Mary? Where is she?
Where is she?
She's just about to close up the library!
There must be some easier way for me to get my wings.
Mary!
Mary!
Mary!
Mary! Mary!
Mary, it's George. Don't you know me?
What's happened to us?
I don't know you. Let me go!
Mary, please! Oh, don't do this to me.
Please, Mary, help me.
Where's our kids? I need you, Mary.
Help me, Mary!
Mary! Let me go!
Help! It's a wild man!
The wild man is chasing me.
Somebody stop him!
Tom! Ed! Charlie!
That's my wife!
- Mary!
- No, you don't.
Somebody call the police.
Somebody hit him on the head with a bottle.
You need a straightjacket.
Clarence!
Get out of here!
Clarence!
- Clarence!
- Right, that's you!
Stand back!
Clarence!
Clarence!
Clarence! Clarence!
Help me, Clarence!
Get me back!
Get me back.
I don't care what happens to me.
Get me back to my wife and kids.
Help me, Clarence, please.
Please. I want to live again.
I want to live again.
I want to live again.
Please, God, let me live again.
Hey, George!
George!
You all right. Hey, what's the matter?
Now get out of here, Bert, or I'll hit you again! Get out of here!
What the sam hill are you yelling for, George?
You...
George? Bert, do you know me?
Know you? You kidding?
I've been looking all over town trying to find you.
I saw your car piled into that tree down there, and I thought maybe you...
Hey, your mouth's bleeding.
Are you sure you're all right?
What did...
My mouth's bleeding, Bert!
My mouth's...
Zuzu's petals. Zuzu... There they are!
Bert! What do you know about that?
- Merry Christmas!
- Well, Merry Christmas.
Mary! Mary!
Hello, Bedford Falls!
Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas, George!
- Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas, George.
Merry Christmas, movie house!
Merry Christmas, emporium!
Merry Christmas, you wonderful old Building and Loan!
Hey, Merry Christmas, Mr. Potter!
Happy New Year to you in jail!
Go on home. They're waiting for you.
Mary! Mary!
Mary!
Well, hello, Mr. Bank Examiner!
How are you?
- Mr. Bailey, there's a deficit.
- I know, $8,000.
George, I've got a little paper here.
I'll bet it's a warrant for my arrest.
Isn't it wonderful? I'm going to jail!
Merry Christmas! Reporters?
Where's Mary?
Mary! Oh, look at this wonderful, old drafty house.
Mary! Mary!
Mary.
Have you seen my wife?
Merry Christmas, Daddy.
Kids! Pete!
Kids! Janie!
Janie! Tommy!
Let me look at you.
Oh, I could eat you up.
Where's your mother?
- She went looking for you.
- With Uncle Billy.
- Daddy!
- Zuzu!
Zuzu, my little gingersnap.
How do you feel?
- Fine! Not a smidge of temperature.
- Not a smidge of...
- Hallelujah!
- Hello.
- George! George, darling!
- Mary! Mary!
George, darling. Where have you been?
- Oh, George, George, George.
- Mary.
Let me touch you.
Let me touch you. Are you real?
George, George.
You have no idea what's happened to me.
You've no idea what happened...
Well, come on, George.
Come on downstairs, quick.
- They're on their way.
- All right.
Come on.
Come on in here now.
Now, you stand right over here by the tree.
Right there, and don't move.
Don't move.
What's happening?
Who's gonna come?
I hear them coming now.
George, it's a miracle. It's a miracle.
- What's happening?
- What's happening?
- Who's gonna come, Daddy?
- Who, Daddy?
Come in, Uncle Billy.
Everybody, in here.
George.
Here's everything right here.
Isn't it wonderful? So many friends.
Mary did it, George! Mary did it!
She told some people you were in trouble, and they scattered all over town collecting money.
Didn't ask any questions.
Just said,
"George in trouble? Then count me in."
- What is this...
- You never saw anything like it.
...another run on the bank?
Here you are, George. Merry Christmas.
Now, don't crowd. Don't push.
There we are.
The line forms on the right.
More coming, George.
Merry Christmas, and God bless you.
Merry Christmas.
- Oh, Mr. Martini!
- Merry Christmas.
Martini! Step right up here.
I busted the jukebox, too.
Oh, Mr. Gower!
I made the rounds of my charge accounts.
I'm not gonna go, George.
I changed my mind.
Violet Bick.
Oh, Annie! Annie!
I've been saving this money for a divorce, if ever I get a husband.
Merry Christmas.
There you are, George.
I got the faculty all up and out of bed.
Here's something for you to play with.
I wouldn't have a roof over my head if it wasn't for you, George.
Just a minute. Just a minute.
Quiet, everybody. Quiet, quiet.
Now, get this, it's from London.
"Mr. Gower cabled you need cash. Stop.
"My office instructed to advance you up to $25,000. Stop.
"Hee-haw and Merry Christmas.
Sam Wainwright."
And Mr. Martini. How about some wine?

Harry, how about your banquet in New York?
Oh, I left right in the middle of it as soon as I got Mary's telegram.
Good idea, Ernie. A toast to my big brother, George, the richest man in town!

-A package of gum, please.
-No gum.
-Then give me a chocolate almond bar.
-Chocolate almond bar?
No chocolate almond bars and no gum.
Where have you been?
-Made up your mind yet, soldier?
-Yeah.
All aboard.
-How much?
-Which one?
Los Angeles Westbound Express. Track two.
-This one.
-A quarter.
Temple, Pinehill...
Greenwood, and points west.
All aboard.
Los Angeles Westbound Express.
-Hey, soldier.
-Me?
Forgot your magazine.
Excuse me, miss. ls this seat taken?
Do you mind if l sit here?
Are you riding alone, or traveling with luggage?
-Cigarette?
-No, thank you.
Going my way?
Are you trying to start a conversation with me?
Hi, everybody!
-Hi.
-Hi, Mac.
You at Guadal? l wouldn´t be a bit surprised if l was in the force that moved you in there.
Could be.
We sure caught it for the first couple of weeks down there.
Hiya, pal.
What are you crying for, dope?
The sailor said hello to you, that´s all.
The kid must have some beef against the Navy.
Say, that´s quite a layout out there. l don´t like prisons.
They give me the creeps.
You got nothing to worry about. lf you get into a jam and wind up in the clink... l got a friend who can give you a low number.
Hot coffee. Get it while it´s hot. Coffee.
Rock breaks scissors.
-Don´t l ever win one of these?
-You´ll catch on to it.
-Scissors cuts paper.
-Holy cats!
-Once more. Let´s go.
-Let´s try it again.
-Rock breaks scissors.
-Come on.
Paper covers rock.
Scissors cuts paper. l´ve been waiting for this.
No matter how this works, l lose out.
-Do you want to try it?
-Too rich for me.
-How about you, miss?
-l´m afraid l couldn´t take it.
What do you say we get something to eat? l´m loaded. l´ll buy everybody coffee and sandwiches.
No ifs, ands, or buts. The treat´s on me.
Papa´s on leave.
-l´ll be back in a flash with the trash.
-l´ll help you carry it.
-Are you going home on furlough?
-Yeah.
Yeah, l´m on furlough.
They gave me a furlough. ls this your first time home since....
Well, l haven´t got any regular home or family. l´m just going to visit.
You traveling on business, or....
No, l´m on vacation. Christmas vacation.
What kind of business are you in? l mean, what sort of work do you do?
Well, l.... l travel. l´m a traveling saleslady. l never heard any jokes about traveling salesladies. l guess there aren´t many. l never would have guessed that´s what you did.
What would you have guessed?
That you were... l don´t know... a secretary or a model maybe... or schoolteacher.
Well, l once was a secretary... and l wanted to be a model.
So that would have been pretty good guessing.
You´re going all the way to L.A.?
No, l haven´t much farther to go, as a matter of fact. l´m getting off at Pinehill.
Pinehill your home?
No. l´m just visiting my uncle.
That´s funny. l´m going to Pinehill, too.
Really?
Yeah. l´m visiting there.
My sister lives in Pinehill.
-l´ll bet she´ll be very glad to see you.
-l hope so.
Maybe we´ll run into each other there.
Yes.
Bye.
61 7 North Elm Street.
Oh, wait. lf.... lf anybody tried to telephone you, how could they get you?
Well, my uncle´s name is in the telephone book.
-Henry Marshall.
-Henry Marshall?
-What´s your name?
-Mary Marshall.
Mary Marshall. Goodbye.
Wait a minute. lf somebody calls and says it´s Zachary Morgan, that´s me.
Glad to meet you.
Merry Christmas. lf there´s anything you want, just holler.
We like to do whatever we can.
Don´t get worried, Zach.
That bayonet wound is all healed...
but the wound in your mind is going to take a little more time.
That´s why the doctors gave you this 10-day leave from the hospital...
to prove to you that you can go out in the world again...
and find a place for yourself.
It´s going to take a little while to get your timing back.
You´ll still drop things and be a little slow, but you´ll get well.
They told you you would.
The important thing is not to get too tired, not to give in.
Then you won´t get any of those....
Those things that wind up with a shot in the arm, or a tub...
or that little room with a barred window.
You can fight those things off, Zach, if you´ll believe that you´ll get well.
Stop thinking about yourself, Zach.
You´ll get well.
-Here you are.
-Aunt Sarah.
-Welcome home, dear. Come on in.
-Thank you.
-How was your trip?
-lt was fine.
You haven´t changed, Mary, not at all.
Thank you, Aunt Sarah. lt´s so good to be here. l´m so glad to have you with us, dear.
Awfully glad.
Barbara, come on down.
You can share Barbara´s room.
-l don´t want to disturb anybody. l don´t--
-Nonsense. Barbara will love to have you.
Here, for Heaven´s sake, give me your coat.
Anyway, it´s the guest room, or it was before Barbara was born.
Besides, l think it´d be a very good thing for Barbara. She´s 1 7.
Seventeen?
And she´s pretty, spoiled, and at an age....
You know. l think an older girl will be a very good thing for her right now, like you.
Yes, like you.
There´s a million things to talk about, but first you want to wash up.
Hello, Mary. l´m awfully glad to see you.
Hello, Barbara.
Why, l never would have known you.
-She´s grown into a beauty.
-Welcome home.
-Take Mary up to your room, dear.
-Follow me, lady, to my boudoir.
Although it´s small, not much bigger than a cell. l´m sorry, Mary.
Look, there´s just one thing.
We all know that l´ve been in prison, and that l´m going back in eight days.
And there´s no use pretending it isn´t so. lt just won´t be any good unless everybody says what he thinks... and doesn´t try to cover up.
You´re a fine girl, Mary.
Now go up and see your room.
That´s Mom´s room. l don´t remember, Mary.
Were you ever here before?
Only once, when you were just a kid.
Here we are.
All the comforts of home. lt´s nice, Barbara.
We even have our own bathroom.
This is where l sleep? l was just thinking, that´s a nice suit you have on, Mary.
Thank you, Barbara.
You were thinking of something else, too.
As a matter of fact, l was.
-Where can l put this?
-l´ll take it.
You may as well tell me, so we can both get it off our minds.
Well, l just.... Well, you see... l hadn´t known that they gave these vacations, or furloughs... to people that....
You don´t have to be shy about it. l didn´t know about it either... till the warden told me that in this state, and in a few other states... they give special furloughs to people for good behavior. l think it´s wonderful that they have that confidence in you.
Yes. l think so, too.
The soap in the dish is mine, yours is on the shelf.
-Mary?
-Yes, l heard you.
You must have been looking forward to it, Mary. l was looking forward to seeing you,
Aunt Sarah.
That´s sweet of you, dear.
As a matter of fact, selfish. l´ve been doing a lot of thinking in the past three years, Aunt Sarah, and....
What sort of things were you thinking, Mary?
Coming out into the world and....
Even coming here, l had a feeling that--
Honey, you´ve got to stop being afraid.
You´ve got to stop feeling that you´re branded like people were in the old days.
You´ve done something, you´re paying your debt to society.
Most people are willing to let it go at that. l know, but coming out into the world... and seeing everybody in uniform, everybody doing something... l just don´t belong, l don´t fit in.
And dreams that l´ve had for the future... are just impossible.
Most dreams are, Mary. lt´s just the dreaming that counts.
Nobody gets exactly what he wants out of life.
One of the first things you learn is to make compromises with your dreams.
But l´m not talking about palaces and rainbows, Aunt Sarah. l´m talking about a home.
A home like this, with a kitchen and a stove and an icebox... and a husband, and a child.
Yes, l have all that.
Yet l used to dream about palaces and rainbows.
But you´re happy.
Of course.
Because l didn´t hold out for too much. l accepted what l thought was second best and made that do. lt´s something that everybody learns sooner or later.
We have to get used to accepting what you think is second best, and then... you find out it´s first best after all.
No, l don´t see how that could....
Yes, this is Mr. Marshall´s home.
Who is it?
Just a minute.
-lt´s for her.
-And why not?
Mary, it´s for you.
Barbara, come and help me set the table.
Thank you.
Hello?
Yes, Zach, this is me.
Of course l meant it. l´d love to, but what about your sister?
That´s too bad. l´d love to, Zach, but....
Wait just a minute.
Aunt Sarah... this is a soldier l met on the train, and he´s really very nice.
He came here to visit his sister, and finds that she´s gone to California... and he wants me to go to dinner with him, and l was wondering if--
A soldier?
Well, why not ask him here for dinner?
-May l, Aunt Sarah?
-You ask him this instant.
And tell him not to be late.
Hello, Zach.
You´re to come over here to dinner, Zach.
But we all want you.
Yes, and Aunt Sarah says not to be late. lt´s 61 7 Elm Street. That´s right.
All right, goodbye.
-How did you ever happen to meet him?
-Well, l--
-Was he good-looking?
-Why, l don´t know.
Didn´t you notice?
No more lollygagging. Hurry and set the table. Your father´ll be here any minute.
A soldier for dinner!
-Hello, Babs.
-Hi, Dad.
-Mary get here yet?
-Yes. She´s in there.
Good.
Thanks.
-Hello, dear.
-Hello.
-Welcome, Mary.
-Hello, Uncle Henry.
-You´re looking fine.
-Thank you. l´m happy to have you here, Mary. l mean it.
Hey, you must have behaved really well for them to give you this vacation. l think that´s fine.
Well, it´s just that they don´t exactly look upon me as a criminal.
No, of course not. l don´t think of you as a criminal, either.
Otherwise l´d never have put up the lawyer money.
-l think you would, Henry.
-Now, Sarah.
What´s done is done.
Let´s think no more about it. l want you to have a good time while you´re here.
Thank you. l want you to feel just like any one of us.
She´s going to, Henry.
We´ve invited a soldier to dinner for her.
You did?
Well, that´s fine. l´m sorry. l thought this was the Marshall house. lt is.
-ls Miss Marshall here?
-l´m Miss Marshall. l mean your.... Mary Marshall.
-Well, she--
-Barbara, stop teasing that young man.
-l´m Mary´s aunt. You´re Zachary?
-Yes.
This is Barbara, my foolish daughter.
-Hello.
-Hi.
-May l take your coat and hat?
-Thank you.
-Hello, Zach.
-Hello, Mary.
You were quick.
Take Zachary into the living room.
Make him comfortable.
Thank you.
Henry, dinner.
-ls it on the table?
-ln a minute.
-Barbara, come with me. l need you.
-Oh, Mother.
This is swell. l haven´t been in a real home like this in almost as long as l can remember. lt´s too bad about you missing your sister.
Well, Mary... l´m in this house under false pretenses. l haven´t any sister. l just made all that up.
When you said you were getting off the train at Pinehill... l had to make up some sort of excuse so l could get off with you.
Good evening.
Uncle Henry, this is Zachary Morgan.
My uncle.
-Happy to have you here, Sergeant.
-Thank you.
Make yourself at home. Happy to do whatever we can for the armed forces.
A man always feels, these days, he´s not doing enough.
How about a drink? Have some bourbon.
No, thank you, l´m not drinking just now.
Well, let you in on a little secret.
Neither am l. lt´s a funny thing.
People that have it don´t want it.
Oh, fine.
People that can´t get it... you ought to see the act they put on in my drugstore to get that stuff.
Supper´s ready. Come and get it.
Hungry?
-Mary, you sit over here. Zach, down there.
-Thank you.
We thank you, God, for our daily bread.
We will do our best to deserve it.
We know that you are present here with us... that you are smiling upon our two guests,
Mary and Zachary.
Please look after all our dear ones... and all the boys who are fighting for our country.
Amen.
You´re not very used to saying grace, are you, Zach?
No. ln the Army l guess you don´t have time.
Didn´t you even say it when you were a kid?
When l was a kid l did, it was just sort of routine.
-You say it as if you meant it, sir.
-l do, Sergeant.
Makes me want to say that l am grateful, too, for being here and everything.
Thank you, Zachary.
-You must be quite a soldier.
-l wouldn´t say that.
The Good Conduct Medal, two campaigns in the South Pacific... and the Purple Heart.
For Heaven´s sake, Barbara, where´d you learn all that?
A girl gets to know medals like she does boogie-woogie.
But the Purple Heart, that means you were wounded.
Barbara, stop asking questions. l´m sure Sgt. Morgan doesn´t like it.
Come on, Zach, tell us how you got to be a hero.
After dinner, you go upstairs and take off some of that lipstick.
Looks as if you fell in a pot of red paint.
Go on, eat your soup, Sergeant, before it gets cold. That´s orders.
You must have been disappointed not to find your sister.
Well, Mrs. Marshall--
She took a defense job in California.
Didn´t she?
Are you mad at me, Zach, for asking all those questions?
No. l´m not mad. You mad?
No, l´m not mad.
Dad.
-Dad, l want to ask you a question.
-Fine. Fire away.
You know, you never told me anything about Mary. l mean, why she was sent to prison, and why she--
You can find out about that some other time, when you´re a little older.
But it can´t be so secret. l don´t see why l shouldn´t know.
Barbara, you can find out about that some other time. lt´s just that Mary made a little mistake, and that´s all there is to it.
But they don´t send people to prison for just doing nothing.
Look, l´m trying to listen to the radio and work this puzzle. l can´t take on another job at the moment.
What if my friends ask me about her?
What´ll l tell them?
-They´ll want to know--
-Just tell them that Mary is your cousin.
From that point on, they can mind their own business.
And it seems to me that your business might be helping your mother.
Dad, sometimes the way you talk to me... you make me feel like l´m an adopted daughter or something.
Sighted Jap, sunk same.
Franklin, behave yourself.
Get up from that pavement this instant.
You´ll all catch your death of cold.
Now, now. l´ll tell your father. l´ll tell your father, that´s....
Not one Christmas present for you.
-ls the war really like that?
-l guess so.
-That´s funny.
-Why? l mean that you should only guess so.
They have experts making those pictures. l guess that´s the way they see the war.
A beach a mile long... and thousands of soldiers and tanks and machine guns and everything. l guess that´s the way it is.
But it wasn´t that way for you? lt´s just a difference in size.
To a guy that´s in it, the war is about 10 feet wide... and kind of empty. lt´s you and a couple of fellows in your company, maybe... and maybe a couple of Japs. lt´s all kind of mixed up.
Sometimes it´s all full of noise, and sometimes it´s quiet. lt all depends on what you´re thinking about, l guess. lt depends on how scared you are... how cold you are, and how wet you are. l guess if you asked a hundred guys what the war is like... they´d all give you a different answer.
-You know what?
-What? l mean... usually you don´t like to talk about it. l never said anything about it before, not to anybody.
-l´m sorry, l--
-No.
No. l feel kind of good.
Let´s go have a drink or something.
All right if we sit back here?
Had that booth reserved for you.
Nothing´s too good for the Army.
No offense, sailor.
-Okay, my friend.
-You see, l´m an old Army man myself.
Yes, sir.
What´ll you have, Mary?
A cup of coffee.
Come on, it´s Christmas. The sky´s the limit.
Have a piece of pie with it.
No, l´ll just have a cup of coffee.
-Two coffees.
-Coming up. Two cups of java.
Sure you won´t have anything else?
Not after that wonderful dinner
Aunt Sarah prepared for us.
They´re nice people. You´re nice people, too.
Hot java for the Army.
Social error. There you are.
Hey, soldier, you certainly been places.
-Would you like some cream?
-No, thanks.
You know, l was just a boy of 18, over in France, in World War l.
They´re kidding themselves.
This is the same kind of war.
-Sure you won´t have some cream?
-No, l don´t use it.
The Navy, Marine, Air Force, they´re okay.
This one´s gonna be just like the last one.
A soldier like you or me, walking out on his own two feet and slugging it out. l took off some weight since my time.
Used to be heavyweight champion of the regiment.
Got a couple of funny medals. Here they are.
When this thing starts, l try to sign up again. l tell them l want a chance to knock a couple of Jap heads together.
Could still do it, too.
Squash them like eggs, l could.
They won´t let me fight.
Why? On account of this tick in my face.
Nothing touched me in the last war. l got a bit of shell shock. lt left me with this. Nobody ever notices it.
But that young doctor squirt, not dry behind his ears... he turns me down. l don´t get it.
Thank you, Mary.
Mary, l.... l think you ought to know something.
What is it, Zach? l wish l could tell you.
You probably think.... l bet l could do better than that.
Hello.
Hello.
-l thought you were asleep.
-No, l´ve been burning the midnight oil.
Here´s my morale list. lt´s fun to think l´m the pinup girl for at least five fellows.
And it´s part of the war effort. l keep up their morale, maybe. lt must be nice to be able to keep up somebody´s morale. l imagine you could write to a lot of them.
They just like to get mail from anybody. l mean, you don´t have to know them awfully well to....
What l mean is....
When l was 1 7, l had a little trouble finding the right words, too. ls Zach stationed here, or....
Barbara, what l´m in prison for isn´t catching. l´m sorry, Mary, l.... l keep hurting you and... l really don´t want to. l guess it is uncomfortable for you... to meet somebody who´s been in prison.
Maybe when you get to know me, you´ll feel differently. l want to know you, Mary. Really, l do.
-How much do you know about me?
-Not much.
Mother and Dad still treat me like a child.
Everything´s a big secret. l don´t think it would hurt for you to know.
As a matter of fact, l think it might help.
-When l was your age, my mother died.
-l remember her.
Way back when l was young.
She used to make clothes for my favorite doll.
Yes, she was wonderful with her hands.
And some time after that, my father went north on business.
And then, when he died, l was on my own.
I got a very good job as a secretary...
and my job brought me in contact with a lot of nice men...
one of whom might have turned out,
I thought, to be the one...
who would give me all the things that you dream about when you´re 20 and lonely.
One day, when I was called into my boss´s office...
he invited me to a party in his apartment.
He was single, and I started dreaming.
Bosses do marry their secretaries.
I took what money I´d saved, and I bought an evening dress.
I thought it was very fancy. I wanted to look good in front of his high-class friends.
He´d sent me an orchid, a white orchid...
the first one I´d ever had.
I was wearing it.
When the door opened, I walked into the biggest apartment I´d ever seen.
I thought it was rich and elegant.
I´d wanted to impress him, so I got there a little late.
I´d wanted to make an entrance all by myself...
but nobody else was there.
I should have had sense enough then to get out, but I didn´t.
He´d been drinking a long time before
I got there, I guess, and he kept right on.
He told me that he hadn´t invited anyone else...
and that the white orchid and all that was just his way of getting me up there.
I tried to talk my way out...
and then when that didn´t work,
I made a break for it.
I didn´t scream.
I was too frightened, I guess.
I tried to get away from him, but I couldn´t.
He seemed to be everywhere.
It was all mixed up, like some terrible kind of a dream.
Once, I almost got away when he fell over a chair.
But he caught me again and dragged me back.
Then I pushed him as hard as I could, and he fell back through the window.
His apartment was on the 1 4th floor.
Mary... how awful.
-Maybe l shouldn´t have told you.
-No, l´m glad you did.
But it´s wrong.
They shouldn´t have sent you to prison. lf l´d been lucky enough to get away before he was killed... then there wouldn´t have been any crime.
But after all, a man was dead.
The jury said manslaughter.
Guilty.
Well, that meant six years.
Please forgive me, Mary.
Mary, see who that is, will you?
Hello?
Good morning, Zach. lf it´s important, of course l can see you.
Do you want to come here? l´d rather not. l hate to keep barging in on your uncle´s house.
Mary, l want to talk to you about last night, and l need some time.
Well, l have the time, plenty of time.
Where do you want to meet? l asked about here, and they say there´s a bus that goes up to the lake. lt´s pretty out there, and there aren´t so many people.
-Not so bad, is it?
-No. l told you there was no use wasting any gas. lt´s only a short walk from here. l know. You´re trying to wear me out before we tee off. l got you.
Hi, Chuck, how´ve you been?
-Hi, swell day?
-Fine. lt´s so pretty.
-Hi.
-Hello.
You born in this part of the country? l was born in Maryland. You get used to
Christmastime being cold and snowy.
This seems more like Christmas to me than the kind they have back east. l mean, this is more like the country where they celebrated the first Christmas.
This reminds me of a lake l used to go to when l was a kid.
Every spring, l had a job repairing the boats.
Mary... l want to tell you why l got mad at that man in the coffee shop last night... and why l walked away after l threw that rock at the lamppost and missed it. l knew there must be some reason, but you don´t have to tell me.
Look, l was brought up in a home, an orphan´s home.
That´s nothing to be ashamed of. l´m not. lt´s not like being in prison, or anything like that.
No. ln the home, there was a janitor.
This fellow had been in the last war.
He was a young guy.
He was a shell shock case.
Whenever we could get our hands on any firecrackers, we´d bang them off... and laugh at him when he jumped.
That fellow in the coffee shop reminded me of the janitor.
They both made me think of myself, and what l´d be like in a few years.
Only difference is that now in the hospital they have a fancy name for it: neuropsychiatric.
The doctors must know more about it now than they did during the last war.
Maybe.
They don´t know something about me that l know.
You see... before l became an engineer... l was an athlete, a pretty good one. l know what my timing used to be, they don´t.
And it´s gone, Mary.
Before this happened to me, l could have hit that lamppost all day. l don´t know why l´m bothering you with all this.
Yes, l do. l know why l´m bothering you.
Because l feel so much better when l talk to you. l like to be with you. l like to be with you, too.
Mary, l want to talk about you.
Listen, tell me....
-What?
-Well....
For instance, how did you become a traveling saleslady, and what do you sell?
As l told you, l started out wanting to be a model... and after that... l got a job with a dress manufacturing company... and now l travel for them.
Where do you travel?
After your vacation, where do you go? l go back to Dallas, and from Dallas l go to New Orleans.
New Orleans? l´ve been there. lt´s a swell town.
You´ve been to New Orleans?
-Have you ever been to Florida?
-No. l go from New Orleans to Florida.
-New Orleans to Florida?
-Palm Beach.
Mary, can you make me believe in myself the way you believe in yourself?
-What makes you think l do?
-l can tell.
The way you talk, the way you walk... the way you look, the way you hold your head.
Maybe that´s just make-believe.
Why don´t we go down here by the rock?
Like boats?
Do you?
Some kid probably owned that boat.
Thought it could take him all around the world and back.
Wish it could. l wish we could get on it and sail away to....
Where would you like to go?
Not Florida or New Orleans.
Some place like the moon, maybe.
With a good breeze and a good compass, maybe we could find a place.
Well, if it were a real boat, and the moon a real place... would you go?
There´s no harm in dreaming. l´d go. l´m not going to have you run out on me again.
Thank you, one and all. l never could figure out why the pudding never gets burned. l´ve never been able to, either.
Must be the alcohol in the brandy. l think. l think it´s a shame to burn a good brandy.
That quart l brought home last week was imported cognac.
Don´t worry, Henry. l didn´t burn up the whole quart. l wouldn´t trust Mom with it, Dad.
Maybe you´re right. Remember last year, how Mom got going on a glass of sherry? l´m not going to listen to that again.
You may not believe this about your dear Aunt Sarah... but last year she got high as a kite. lf they´re trying to drag out a family skeleton... l won´t listen to them. lt´s just one of those little things that happen, people start exaggerating.
Exaggerate, my eye. lt´s as true as l sit here.
Last year, Mother and l had a glass of sherry to bring in the New Year.
And then we went to a little gathering.
All the way across town it was.
And Mother had her skirt on backwards. lf you´re in such good voice, how about a Christmas carol?
Aunt Sarah, something tells me you´re trying to change the subject.
Nothing of the sort.
Christmas carols go with plum pudding.
And we´re eating plum pudding.
Sarah, you don´t have to work so hard at it. l´m a pretty good baritone, and l don´t need much urging.
What´ll it be?
l think l like best Come All Ye Faithful.
Fine. Come All Ye Faithful it is.
O come, all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
O come ye
O come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold him
Born the King of angels
O come, let us adore him
O come, let us adore him
O come, let us adore him
Christ the Lord! lt feels pretty comfortable to have another man´s voice around here at Christmastime. l´m sure Barbara´s doing her best to arrange that for you, Henry.
Mother.
Maybe family jokes are in bad taste.
-They make the guest feel out of place.
-No, ma´am. l haven´t felt so easy in a long time.
This is the best Christmas dinner l ever had.
Yesterday l was a stranger here. l mean, l felt like a prisoner inside myself.
Now... just to be in a home like this with people like you... maybe someplace l can come back to, next month, or next year....
-Did l say something?
-No, Zach.
-lt´s just that Mary´s sentimental or--
-lt´s Christmas....
Mary, what´s the matter? ls it anything l said?
Anything to do with this afternoon?
No, it´s just... a combination of things.
The pudding, and the singing... and the very nice things you said.
First time my singing ever brought anybody to tears.
Maybe l´d better get out of here. lt isn´t polite to eat and run. l mean Pinehill. l ought to leave you alone.
You´re just fishing.
You want me to ask you to stay.
Well, ask me.
Please, stay.
Sarah, this is silly.
We can´t just sit here all night.
They´ve got to have a couple of minutes to talk things over.
They´ve had a couple of minutes.
Come on, Dad. Let´s go on in.
We´d better give them a warning first.
Well, that´s all the plum pudding l can eat.
Can´t eat another bit.
Let´s play the radio.
Fine.
Come, darling. lt´s present time.
Henry´s going to act as Santa Claus.
Come on.
-Here you are, Mother dear.
-This is for you, dear. ls that for me? Thank you, dear.
Look at the size of it.
-Can l have one?
-No, you can´t have one. l know what it is.
Henry, you darling, you did get it after all.
My goodness! Look what l got.
-Here you are, darling.
-Thank you, Uncle Henry.
-Did Zach get his?
-Zach.
-Thank you, Aunt Sarah.
-l hope you like it, dear.
-Merry Christmas.
-Thank you. l understood, Mary.
When Zach said he was a stranger... you felt as if the words were coming from your own lips.
Might have happened to any girl.
Could have been just Christmas sentiment.
Good night, Mary.
-Good night, Uncle Henry.
-Good night.
-Don´t forget to turn out the lights, Sarah.
-All right, dear.
So don´t worry about making a scene. l´m not worrying about that, Aunt Sarah. l was just wondering if l shouldn´t tell him about me.
-Not for the world.
-You don´t think so?
Well, why?
He trusts me... and it doesn´t seem fair.
There´s no reason for it, Mary.
He´ll only be here for a few days.
He´s lonely, and you´re making things pleasant for him.
That´s not the reason l´m seeing him,
Aunt Sarah.
Because l like him. l like him a lot.
Of course you do, dear, but it isn´t as if you were gonna marry him.
No. lt isn´t as though l was going to marry him. l didn´t mean it like that, dear. l know.
Have fun, Mary.
See Zach every day, if you like.
Act like any other girl. l try, Aunt Sarah, but l.... l can´t seem to make myself feel like any other girl. l just feel like me.
And that´s pretty darn good.
Now you have fun.
Hey, you two. What´s cooking?
Remember, Mary, l don´t think so.
Good night, dears.
Good night, Aunt Sarah.
She doesn´t think so, what?
She doesn´t think there really is a Santa Claus.
Mother, look. lt just fits. l love it.
Do you think a long skirt? lt´s for New Year´s Eve. lt has to be long. lsn´t it a little old for you, dear?
For Heaven´s sake, l´m going out with a lieutenant.
Yes, l´m quite aware of the responsibility of the occasion...
-but that neckline.
-So that´s it.
For your information, mother, this neckline´s a morale builder.
How would you like to try on this?
-That´s lovely.
-Yes, it´s one of the best designs we have.
No, Mommy, please. l want this one.
All right, dear.
-lt fits you perfectly.
-lt feels perfect, too. l´ll be right back.
-You like this one, don´t you, Mary?
-lt´s lovely.
-Then you´re going to have it.
-No.
Now you listen to me, Mary.
You can´t wear the same clothes every day.
Your soldier boy´s gonna get tired of them. l´ve been fooling him well enough so far. l´ve been wearing one blouse after another. l don´t need a dress.
Zach´s made a big thing of inviting us all to this New Year´s Eve party.
You can´t wear a suit. l´ll manage.
Henry and l have talked it over.
We want you to have a dress.
Henry will be so disappointed if you don´t accept it.
Darling, l´ll only be able to wear it once. lt´ll be out of style in three years.
Then we´ll burn it.
-Miss?
-Yes.
-My niece would like to try on this dress.
-lt will be fine on you.
Go on, dear. Try it on.
Well, all right, l´ll try it on.
-How about you, Mrs. Marshall?
-Thank you, my lavender is still good.
Mother, it´s just going to be swell.
Thank you.
Now, you run along, pick up your father at the store.
Okay. Thanks again. You´re so wonderful.
You know how impatient your father is.
Now run along.
-How much is this dress?
Would you take the tag off, please?
Look, here´s $30.
And when my aunt asks you the price, you tell her it´s $39, instead of $69.
-lt´s a bargain.
-Thank you.
Miss...
-how much was that dress? l´ll give you $20.
When l ask you again how much it was, you tell me it´s $19.
-Do you like it?
-lt´s darling on you.
-lsn´t it sweet?
-lt was made for you.
Miss, how much is this dress?
That´s a wonderful buy.
What are you laughing at?
-How do you like my dress?
-Swell, isn´t it?
Some hep chick, huh?
-Hello, Zach. Do come in.
-Hello, Barbara.
-Don´t you notice anything, Zach?
-Where?
-About me.
-Got on too much lipstick again.
-Hello, Zach.
-Hello, Mr. Marshall.
Lt. Bruce, this is Sgt. Morgan.
-Hello, Lieutenant.
-How do you do? lsn´t a sergeant supposed to salute a lieutenant?
Only on the street. Anyhow, from the decorations the Sergeant´s wearing... l ought to do the saluting.
That´s not what it says in the book.
-My coat, Lieutenant.
-Sure, Your Majesty.
Henry, are you ready?
No, Sarah, l´m down here in my bathrobe, working on this puzzle.
Don´t be impatient, dear.
We´ll be right down.
-Fine.
-Good night, Pa.
Good night, baby.
Take care of her, Lieutenant.
Why does everybody treat me like a child? l can take care of myself.
We won´t be late. Good night, Mr. Marshall.
Good night, sir.... Sergeant.
Good night, sir.
Here´s a nice big piece of sky for you,
Mr. Marshall.
Henry, get your hat. We´re ready.
Well, let´s get going, Zach, before they change their minds.
Got my bag, and my gloves, and my purse, and....
Sarah. Now where is she?
-Sarah, are we going, or--
-Henry, you left the scullery light on.
Mrs. Marshall, this is for you. l hope you like camellias.
This is for you, Mary. l hope you like white orchids.
Thank you, Zach. l haven´t had a corsage in years.
-Henry, did you lock the kitchen door?
-Let´s go, Sarah.
There´s some mistake. l knew l´d do it.
That´s what happens when a man gets mixed up in things he shouldn´t.
The orchids are for you, Mary.
That´s all right, Aunt Sarah.
Sarah, are we going tonight?
The camellias were promised to me, and l´m going to have them.
-lt really doesn´t matter.
-These were intended for you.
Sarah.
Darling, just give me a minute. Look at that.
-We´re gonna be late.
-Flowers make you feel so like a party.
-Wasn´t that sweet of Zach?
-Sarah!
You´re always so impatient.
Have you got the key?
Never mind.
Tell me, Johnny, are you sure it´s all right for a girl to go into the YMCA?
Change your partners, do-si-do.
-Fine.
-Fine, fine. l don´t know how it is, but every year at New Year´s, l get so excited and...
-sort of upset.
-l know what you mean. lt´s like being in on something big, something important.
That´s it exactly.
Back to your partners, with a right and left grand.
-Thank you.
-Thanks, Mary, that was...
-Thank you, Uncle Henry.
-...swell.
I´ll be seeing you
In every lovely summer´s day
In everything that´s light and gay
I´ll always think of you
Two weeks ago, if somebody had told me l´d be dancing... with a girl like you, know what l´d have said?
What would you have said? l´d have said that l wouldn´t be dancing with a girl like you.
I´ll be looking at the moon
But I´ll be seeing you
-Cutting in. Hello, Mary.
-Hello.
Maybe you don´t recognize me in the outfit Uncle Sam gave me.
-l´m sorry, l don´t.
-Charlie Hartman, Accounting Department.
Yes, l´m terribly sorry. l´d forgotten.
This is Sgt. Morgan.
This is Charlie Hartman.
How about a dance?
Boy, am l surprised to see you, Mary. l didn´t think you were trying to give me the brush. What happened?
-l thought you were still....
-Well, l am.
-They gave me a 10-day Christmas vacation.
-Good. You gonna be around?
Yes.
Charlie, the fellow l´m with... he doesn´t know about me, and l´d appreciate it very much... you know, if you wouldn´t--
Sure, Mary. Forget it.
Thanks, Charlie.
Wait a minute, Mary.
Excuse me, could l have a light, please?
Here, Sergeant. Have a cigar.
-Thank you, sir.
-You´ve been in the South Pacific?
Yes, sir.
Just the kind of man we want to talk to.
Let me introduce myself. l´m Senator Hugh D. Emmett.
-How do you do, sir?
-This is my friend, John Tombes.
Glad to know you, Sergeant.
Executive chairman of the committee that raised the funds for this party.
-Thank you, sir.
-Sergeant... we would like to get the point of view of the soldiers about several things.
-Soldiers?
-Yes.
We would like to know from you what the soldier thinks.
-Thinks about what?
-Thinks about political issues.
Senator, l don´t know.
What gives you the idea that because a fellow puts on a soldier´s suit... he thinks any differently from anybody else?
What does the soldier think? l tell you... last time some of us voted for Roosevelt, and some of us didn´t.
Some of us weren´t old enough to vote.
Some soldiers think labor´s got a right to strike... and some soldiers think labor´s got no rights at all.
A lot of soldiers have got one idea about what should happen after the war.
A lot of soldiers have other ideas.
Me? l haven´t the slightest notion what a lot of soldiers think.
Senator, thanks for the cigar.
Unless somebody gypped me with this watch 15 years ago... it´s New Year´s.
We´ve got to find Mary and Zach. Excuse us.
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And days of auld lang syne?
For auld lang syne, my dear
For auld lang syne
We´ll take a cup o´ kindness yet
For auld lang syne
Happy New Year.
What was that, that that poet said about the deep-throated dog?
-He´s just barking in the New Year.
-That´s not what he said. l didn´t mean that.
Do you believe that saying, a barking dog never bites? l believe anything you say.
The thing about a dog is... you must never let him know you´re afraid of him. That makes him angry.
You´ve got to treat him like an old friend.
Here, boy.
See what l mean? l´d hate to run into him in a dark alley.
What do you think this is?
Zach!
Stay away, Mary. Stay away.
Duke!
-Are you hurt?
-No.
-No, but he could have been.
-l´m sorry.
Are you all right?
-You know something?
-What?
The doctors are gonna be very surprised when they see you.
They´ll probably send you back to active duty.
That lemonade must have been spiked.
No, l really mean it.
Do you realize what you did tonight?
-You couldn´t have done that a week ago.
-Why? l´ve watched you all evening.
When you were dancing, you never hesitated for words... and your eyes didn´t blink.
And then when that dog attacked us, l´ve never seen anyone so fast on their feet.
-l didn´t think about what l was doing.
-Exactly. You were so alert and keen.
And your timing was perfect. l hope you´re right. l believe you are.
Mary, you told me that in eight days you can do a lot of believing.
You see, l´m the fellow that´s on the radio that says:
-´´Life can be wonderful.´´
-You´re wonderful.
You´re saying that because l´ve got lots of money.
You´re wonderful.
Because you know l´ve got very influential friends.
Because of my social position.
Mary, l know l´m going to get well. l´ve got plans, too, lots of them. l know l´m going to stay well, too, because you figure in all my plans.
You´ve got to figure in them because... without you, l´m back where l started. l´m sunk.
Let´s don´t talk about it tonight. l´m kind of sleepy.
Okay.
Tomorrow, before l go, l´ve got a lot of things to tell you.
Good night, Zach.
Happy New Year. l love you very much. ls that you, Mary?
Are you all right?
Aunt Sarah, l love him so.
What are you going to do? l don´t know.
He´s going to ask me to marry him.
He would´ve asked me tonight if l´d let him.
-Did you tell him?
-No.
Are you going back on the train with him tomorrow?
No. l´m going to catch a later train tomorrow night.
Why don´t you give yourself that extra time with him, Mary?
Because l´m afraid to be alone with him. l mustn´t tell him. l lied to him, l told him l was going to stay here a couple of extra days.
Don´t you think he´s strong enough yet to know about you? l can´t take that chance, Aunt Sarah.
He´s getting well.
And l want him to go back to the hospital sure of himself... and sure of me.
Remember, what you have to do may seem to be second best... but it may work out to be first best.
Aunt Sarah, l hope so.
Happy New Year, Mr. Lincoln.
Happy New Year, Zach.
May l have this dance with you, Sergeant?
Happy New Year.
Hold on, Zach. Hold on.
You´re just a little tired, that´s all.
There was a lot of excitement. That fight with the dog took a lot out of you.
That´s why you´re sweating.
It doesn´t mean anything.
Sit down, Zach, sit down.
That´s it. Sit down, take it easy.
Don´t get scared, Zach.
Maybe it is one of those things.
They told you it might happen.
Hang on, Zach, hang on.
You know what you´re going to have to go through.
It´s sure banging away.
It doesn´t sound that loud.
You´re just thinking it does, that´s all.
The doc told you there´s nothing wrong with your heart.
Beating fast like that doesn´t mean anything.
This is it. You thought for a minute it wasn´t, but it is.
You´re in for it now.
You know the next step.
You know what´s coming now.
It´s tough to get hold of yourself, Zach.
Better call for a doctor and let him get the hypo ready, or maybe a tub.
Zach.
Zach, you´ve got eight days to believe.
Eight days. You must believe. l made it.
Barbara!
Barbara, that´s awful stuff for a man to wake up to!
How can you stand it so early in the morning?
Dad, it´s beautiful music, a lovely day, and a wonderful New Year.
That´s the trouble with young people.
They´re so doggone young.
There you are. l was beginning to think l´d have to bring breakfast to you in bed. lt´s not a bad idea, Sarah. l might try it sometime.
That was the best part of having my appendix out.
-Please, Henry. One egg or two?
-Three. l´m hungry.
-Good morning, Mr. Marshall.
-Hello, Zach. Happy New Year.
-Come on in.
-Had a good time last night?
Fine. Best party l´ve been to since last New Year.
-Have you had your breakfast yet?
-Yes, sir. Early.
Here´s the paper. Make yourself at home.
Be with you in a minute.
Drive you down to the station. Hope you enjoy Barbara´s melodious concert.
-Who were you babbling to?
-Zach.
Good morning, Mary.
-Good morning, Zach.
-Good morning, Mrs. Marshall.
-Hello, Mary.
-Hello, Zach. l was just fixing some sandwiches for you to take with you.
Shouldn´t you get ready to go down to the station?
Yes, l´ll go get my hat and things. l´ll be back in just a minute.
Mary´s fixing up a little box lunch for you. l want a string to tie it up with. lt´s difficult to get anything to eat on the train.
-Very nice of you.
-Hello, Sergeant. Happy New Year.
-Happy New Year. How was your party?
-Solid.
-You going back to active duty, Zach?
-Not for a while yet.
You look a lot better than you did a week ago.
-Feel a lot better.
-Was it the Marshall food that did it?
Must´ve helped. l think it was mostly your cousin Mary.
She´s awfully nice. l´ve noticed that, too.
You know what? l think l´ll marry her.
-Are you kidding?
-Not as far as l´m concerned.
-Of course, l don´t know about her yet.
-Won´t you mind waiting?
That´s up to Mary, really.
Things have worked out so well, l may not have to wait as long as l thought.
That´s what the folks have always hoped for... that she won´t have to serve her full term now.
But the fact that they let her out of prison for Christmas is a pretty good sign.
You know, it wasn´t until the other night, when she told me how it all happened... that l realized it really isn´t her fault.
She´s not a criminal. l mean, not like real criminals. lt´s too bad that you two can´t go back on the train together.
But then, Mary isn´t due in Easton until 9:00 tonight.
She wants to spend as much time with us as she can.
You can´t blame her, after being locked up for three years.
Come on, Zach. We´re gonna be late. Mary?
Goodbye, Zach.
Have a nice trip, and come back real soon. l hate to say goodbye, Zach.
-Come on. We´re gonna be late.
-Thank you again, Mrs. Marshall.
Good luck.
Have you got the box? l´ll get it. l hope you like chicken sandwiches.
Zach, is there any special address... or do l write to you in care of the hospital at Easton?
Yeah, care of the hospital.
You can write to me in care of
Uncle Henry´s address.
They´ll forward it to wherever l happen to be.
Because l won´t know what hotels l´ll be able to stop at. l understand.
Board!
-Goodbye, Mary.
-Goodbye, Zach. Here.
Thank you.
-Zach, will you write to me?
-Sure. l´ll write.
Zach, what´s the matter? What´s wrong?
-Board!
-Nothing. Bye, Mary.
-Bye, Zach. Goodbye.
-Bye.
What´s the matter with Zach, Mary?
He acted kind of strange. l think l know.
-Mother.
-Look out, don´t break any of those globes.
Mother, if you´d been in Mary´s place... wouldn´t you have gone along with Zach?
Never mind, dear.
Don´t ask so many questions.
As long as Zach´s willing to wait for Mary...
-till she gets out of prison, l--
-Prison? Barbara!
-You didn´t tell him?
-Wasn´t Zach supposed to know?
No.
Why didn´t anybody tell me?
Why didn´t you tell me, Mother? l´m sorry, dear. l should have told you.
Mary´s always treated me like a grownup. l didn´t want to hurt her. l´ve done something terrible.
Mary, l told him. l didn´t want to hurt you. l didn´t know. l told him.
We´re so sorry.
Mary, l´m so ashamed.
Please, forgive me. l love you, Mary. l wouldn´t want to hurt you, not for anything. l understand something.... l understand something now that l never knew before... that you can make a mistake, do something dreadful... without meaning to.
Mary. lt´s all right, Barbara.
Mary, l didn´t want to make you cry.
There´s nothing wrong with crying at a time like this.
The minute l got on the train, l knew why you didn´t tell me.
Nothing matters, except that you´re here. l´m terribly ashamed of walking out like that. l need you, Mary. l want to feel that you need me. l do. l´ll be right here. l´ll be right here waiting. l´ll be all well by then.
Ready to make a new start, too.
Zach, l love you so much.
Whoa.
All out, all out! What's the matter, a holdup?
Nope, they missed us.
This is as far as we go.
Wait. It says three miles to Wagon Gap.
That's as close as we go, partner.
That sign is a warning. Nobody that ain't loco ever goes closer.
I hope you sell your wares.
I hear tell there's a lot of money in Wagon Gap.
The only problem is to live long enough to get it out.
Partner, which way you say it was to Wagon Gap? That way.
That way? Come on, Duke. Wait a minute.
What are you scared of? Wagon Gap.
We'll sell our wares tonight and leave for California in the morning.
If you boys are going into Wagon Gap, strap on a couple of shootin'irons.
If you can bluff'em, you might live till morning.
He's got something there.
How much will you take for those guns? Fifty dollars.
It's a deal. There you are. Thanks.
Aw, Duke, that ain't fair. What's wrong?
Look. Yours is much longer than mine! So what?
All you have to do is stand closer to whoever is shooting at you.
As long as you boys are going into Wagon
Gap, would you mind taking this mail?
Why, certainly!
There you are.
Giddyap, horse.
"Joe Bazzo,
Erskine Lakes.
"Dear Sal, this is to let you know...
"we are building a new log house where the old log house stood.
"We are using the logs from the old log house to build the new log house, but we are going to let the old log house stand until the new log house is built. "
I don't get it. What are you reading other people's mail for?
What are you ducking for?
You scared?
Come on, get with it.
Duke, let's go in here.
It's safe.
Chester, come out of there!
You don't belong in there.
What's the matter? Tired? Sit down. Yeah.
Come on.
Let's go.
Chester, don't let this town scare you. You gotta keep saying,
"I must be brave. I must be strong. " Say it to myself?
Certainly! I must be brave. I must be strong.
Now you're talking!
I must be brave.
I must be strong.
I must be nuts!
Oh, no, you don't!
Come back with that merchandise!
What are you gonna do?
Be just as tough as they are!
You never shot one of those.
What's the difference?
Get out your gun.
I never shot one either. Take the gun out. We'll fix them.
What am I gonna do with it?
Shoot it off! Up in the air.
But it makes a noise. C'mon, shoot it off!
It's Fred Hawkins!
That's nice shooting, partner.
And you got him right through the heart.
I got him? I shot over there. He fell over here.
Then that really is nice shooting!
Jake Frame's been tryin' to get rid of this varmint!
C'mon inside.
He'll set up the drinks free.
I told you shooting was the only way to come into this town.
Wait a minute.
This man's just been killed.
So? Who's upset? I am.
Judge?
Judge Benbow?
Judge?
Jim, what are you and the
Citizens' Committee riled about now?
I demand that those men be charged with murder and held for trial.
Well, now,
I don't know, Jim.
It looks like a friendly shootin' affair to me. Self-defense.
Fred there's got a gun in his hand.
There have been 10 killings in the last week... and not one man has been brought to trial.
What sort of law do we have here? All right, if you insist.
What's the deceased got on him?
Twelve dollars and this knife in his hip pocket.
I hereby fine the deceased $12 for carrying concealed weapons.
Just a minute, Judge. You heard what the judge said.
Yeah, just a minute, Judge.
Stay out of this, Frame.
This is one pair of killers you're not getting off.
Simmer down.
I'm on your side.
Just what kind of a trial was that? Jake, I...
Strangers come into town and shoot down one of our best-beloved citizens...
And you want to let them get away with it.
What's got into you? That's the fellow that was gonna buy us a drink?
It isn't safe for a man to walk the streets of Wagon Gap.
You said it. That fellow almost fell on me.
If the law won't do something, we better do something.
I'm thinkin' a little taste of rope is called for!
Wait a minute.!
Judge Benbow, stop this. You nor anybody is stopping this hanging, Simpson.
Get outta the way.
You're obstructing justice!
Is that hard to do? No, no.
You'll soon get the hang of it.
Try this on for size.
Sixteen and one-half.
How's that?
That tickles.
Yeah? That did it. It don't tickle no more.
The Citizens' Committee is headed this way. Get goin', boys.
We gotta stall 'em.
Stall 'em? Oh, stall 'em!
Ever hear the story about the traveling salesman? They've heard that.
Yes, and it ain't funny. Wait a minute!
What about our personal possessions?
Don't you want to send something to your dear mother for a keepsake?
My mother? Yes! To your mother.
Oh, my mother! I would like to send some stuff to my mother.
Would you take care of this stuff for me? I'd be happy to.
It's priceless, this stuff.
Hold that please.
Give it to him.
String 'em up!
Sorry to spoil your party.
This is gonna be done legally.
Since when are you the law? I don't see the sheriff's badge.
Somebody put a bullet hole through it.
Till we can keep a live sheriff, the committee's taking over.
We're seeing that these men get a fair trial. Fair enough.
And I'll see to it thatJudge
Benbow gives it to 'em.
C'mon, boys!
Just because he don't like you, he's mad at us. Don't be ungrateful.
If it wasn't for Mr. Simpson, we'd be dead.
If it wasn't for Mr. Simpson, we'd be on our way to California.
Give us a couple of horses and show us the road.
We'll call it even. The only road you're taking is to Wagon Gap.
You're charged with a killing, and you're gonna stand trial.
You can figure out your plea.
I'll plead insanity.
And I can prove it too.
This court will now come to order.
Close down that bar!
And quit gambling for a few minutes!
Will the jury file in.
I object!
Order in the court!
He objected... to what you said.
I figured you might be wanting a jury... so, to save time,
I picked one for you.
Look!
That's the gang that was gonna hang us.
To keep everything legal,
in case you don't like any member of thejury, you can challenge him.
I'll fight that little shrimp there. Order!
Order in the court!
Young man, in about two shakes,
I'll hold you in contempt.
Judge, quit stalling. Let's get this over with. Okay, Jake.
Hmm.
As the judge, I hereby sentence you two coyotes...
Just a minute,
Your Honor.
I'd like the court's permission to say a few words to the defendants.
I don't know, Jim. We're keeping
Jake's business shut down, and these delays are costing him money.
But go ahead and make it snappy. Thank you, Your Honor.
Boys, it strikes me mighty curious thatJake
Frame's so anxious to get you hung.
I'd like to know why. Don't ask us. We're strangers.
If you'll string along with me,
I've got an angle to keep you alive.
All right, Mr. Simpson.
We're in back of you. Good.
Your Honor, the defendants are willing to plead guilty... to the charge of killing
Fred Hawkins in a gun duel.
He did it again.
He said we did it.
Now they'll hang me.
Are you guilty?
No. Then what are you worrying about?
Oh.
Jim, the court thanks you for simplifying matters.
I hereby sentence you two coyotes... Your Honor, may I remind you that you have a jury? I picked them, didn't I?
You picked some before they were ripe!
Shut up, you.!
You boys want to get your heads together and bring in a verdict of...
Your Honor, I suggest you first acquaint the jury... with the statutes pertaining to dueling.
Jim, let's not get all snarled up in legal folderol.
I have the statues. Would you like me to read them?
Or would you prefer to quote them from memory?
No, no.
Go ahead.
Section 86-97 of the penal code of the sovereign state of Montana.
"If any person slays or permanently disables another person in a duel,
"the slayer must provide for the maintenance... of the wife of the slain and for the minor children. "
And Section 86-98...
"Said slayer must pay all debts of the person slain. "
What does he mean?
Yes.
Oh. In simpler language, the law makes these men responsible... for all the obligations of the deceased... both to his family and his creditors.
Hawkins owed me $50,
Your Honor.
Considering what Hawkins owed me,
I'd say that's a right good law.
As a matter of fact, Jake,
I think so myself.
Especially the part about them maintaining the widow.
Well, this is it. I don't see any corn growing.
The widow don't grow corn.
Then what's that scarecrow doing in the yard? Who you calling a scarecrow?
You scatterbrained numskull!
Ah, the Widow Hawkins!
Howdy, Mrs. Hawkins. These are them. The culprits, huh?
Mrs. Hawkins, I'm awful sorry. Oh, think nothin' of it!
I ain't hypocrite enough to shed tears for Hawkins.
He wasn't any good. All he ever did was drink and gamble.
Hawkins, come here!
All he ever did was drink and gamble. Come on, Duke!
Nice dog.
Go on, Wolf. You have the situation well under control, ma'am.
Guess we can get back to town. Just a minute, Judge.
As long as our main obligation is to take care of Mrs. Hawkins and the kids, why can't we make some kind of a financial arrangement? Such as?
We'll give her some cash now and send a little every month from California.
How much you got?
Well, let me see.
Hmm, I have $70.
Precisely the amount the deceased owed me. Poker the other night.
Duke, think of something else. I have.
Judge, there was only one bullet found in the body of the deceased.
You can't hold both of us.
It's not legal.
Don't get technical.
You got a point, Eagan.
Yes, and he's pointing it at me. Quiet.
Ma'am, we have to keep this thing legal. We've got to let one go.
Which one do you prefer?
Well... ain't much to pick from, is there?
The little one looks good, but maybe the big one would be a better worker.
Ahem. Judge, you have no objections if we gamble for this?
There's no law against gambling providing it's honest.
I'll play it as honest as you would. Go ahead.
Take a card.
Any one? Any card. I won't even look.
Don't look at it! You didn't give me a chance.
Don't try to cheat.
Play it on the up and up.
What card were you thinking of? What card?
What card were you thinking of?
C'mon, get it over with.
I was thinking of the nine of clubs.
Oh, no. It was the eight of spades.
That's the card you were thinking of? That was the card.
How do you know it was the eight of spades? Just a minute!
What does that look like? The eight of spades.
That ain't fair. Just a minute, please.
You, you, you! I'll leave it to the judge. Judge?
That's the way I'd have done it. That's what I thought.
Good-bye, ol' pal.
I'm going to miss you.
On my way to California, I'm going to be alone and desolate,
left with nothing but fond memories of our long friendship.
Good-bye, Chester, old boy. Good-bye, Duke.
Ma'am, take good care of him.
I feel terrible bein' the cause of you two good friends partin'.
It'll be hard for me for a while, but I'll get over it.
Judge, my money.
What money?
You found me innocent. Therefore I don't have to pay Hawkins's debts.
That's right.
Son, it sort of cracks my heart to separate you two fellows.
So I'm gonna do you a kindness.
I hereby appoint you custodian of the guardian.
And as such, you will see... that he carries out the terms of his sentence.
What's that for?
Legal fees.
But... that's not...
That's not legal.
Just as legal as that card trick of yours.
Ma'am, they're both yours. I'll get back to town. Good afternoon, gents.
All right, men.
Let's go.
Are you satisfied?
Now we're both stuck on this broken-down ranch with nothing to do but work.
Hey, it could be pretty nice work too.
Juanita?
Come here.!
This is Juanita, my eldest.
How do you do? I'm Duke Eagan.
This is my pal,
Chester Wooley.
This one's your new guardian.
And this is a critter that needs guarding.
She's got some frisky notions
I'm expecting you to halter.
I don't think you'll be mean to me, Mr. Wooley, or can I call you Daddy? Oh, ho-ho.
What's the matter with you?
I'm a guardian to the guardian, but you can call me... Call him Duke.
Juanita, get in the house and rustle up something for supper.
You fellows go to the pump and wash up.
Go with 'em, Wolf.
I hope this soup's just right.
If I'm any judge of character, the way to Mr. Wooley's heart is through his stomach.
You don't have to cotton to him, Ma. He's a prisoner of war.
When a woman gets to be my age, the only way she can be sure of a man is to marry him.
I've got the young'uns to think of.
Suppose Mr. Wooley isn't the marrying kind?
Oh, every man's the marrying kind!
All you got to know is how to go about gettin' him.
More flies are caught with honey than vinegar.
So beginning now, I'm a woman of honeyed words.
Everything I say to Mr.
Wooley will be sweet as nectar.
My muted voice will be tuned to the strings of his heart.
My touch will be feathery light as I stroke those strings... to bring forth a dulcet melody of love.
What ifhoney doesn't work on Mr. Wooley?
Then I'll hog-tie him!
Come and get it!
Come and get it!
Matt, get outta there!
Beginning tonight, Mr. Wooley sits at the head of the table.
Ma? Git before I take a ladle to you.
Take your rightful place,
Mr. Wooley.
Mr. Eagan, you sit on
Mr. Wooley's left hand... and, Matt, you sit on his right hand.
What do I eat with? My feet? Oh, sit down.
Ha-ha.
Fooled ya!
Ha! Ha, ha.
Ha!
Sit down. What's the matter with you? Okay.
Mr. Wooley, help yourself to some bread, fresh baked, especially for you.
Duke, can I have a piece of bread?
Help yourself.
There's none there.
Have a piece of mine.
Hog, don't eat so fast!
Mr. Wooley, have a piece of my bread.
Thank you.
You're such a good child.
Soup's one of my best dishes.
Try it, Mr. Wooley.
Please excuse yourself.
I didn't do nothing. See that it don't happen again.
Go on, eat your soup.
Go on, eat your soup! Yes, sir.
I told you not to let that happen again.
Excuse yourself!
I didn't do nothing.
It's the soup. Don't blame it on the soup.
I don't have to brag about my soup,
Mr. Wooley. It speaks for itself.
You can say that again.
Oh, eat your soup.
It's that good, huh? Mm-mmm, delicious.
That's okay with me.
Listen, don't hurt the widow's feelings. I won't say nothing.
Look, eat the soup whether you like it or not.
So I'll make a face. What do
I care? Just eat your soup.
Stop talkin' and let me eat my soup. Eat it.
Ahem, ahem. You got a frog in your throat?
Of course not.
I'm sorry. It's the way he eats at home.
What's the matter?
Yeah, the soup.
You can't dive into it.
Just eat it.
What's the matter with you?
Is something wrong?
What is it?
You've got a tongue, haven't you?
What? Eh?
You're trying to say something.
Well, bring it out!
It's a fine conversation.
Very interesting.
Eat your soup.
Duke, will you eat my soup and let me eat your soup?
Will that make you happy? Very happy.
My goodness, take it.
Thank you ever so much.
I'll take care of it.
Thank you very much.
It's all right.
How is it? You heard what the widow said.
Her soup speaks for itself. Not only that. It will talk back to you.
You don't know what you're talking about. I don't.
Are you expecting company? No, but you are.
You eat too dainty!
Quiet.
Go on, eat.
Delicious.
Dig right in!
It ain't nice to do those things.
Will you please make up your mind?
Eat your soup.
Eat yours.
What a night.
I love the stars
I love the moon
I'd love December
If it came in June
I...
Yi-yi-yi.
Lovely.
Did you like it? Uh-huh.
Sit down, Mr. Wooley.
Thank you.
Ah, loose your tie.
Go ahead! I don't know you that well.
Land sakes, man. I want you to make yourself to home.
Mr. Wooley, I ain't a person to beat around the bush.
I'm a woman. You're a man. That's the nicest thing anybody ever said to me.
Well, Mr. Wooley,
Chester, a woman means a lot to a man, and a man can mean a lot to a woman.
Me and Hawkins didn't get along. He never come home.
I've been a lonesome woman these past few years.
I know just how you feel.
I've been awful lonesome myself. Have you?
Haven't you ever wanted somebody... waitin' for you when you come home at night?
Somebody... Somebody to kiss you when you open the front door?
Someone whose hair you caress with a loving touch?
Someone whose presence would cheer and warm you?
Haven't you ever wanted to embark on the sea of matrimony?
Your boat of bridal wreath and orange blossoms... crosses the shoals of acquaintance into the sea of affection.
The tempest of love causes the waves of emotion... to toss you helter-skelter, hither and thither, here and yon, round and round.
Stop, stop.
Stop the boat.
I'm gettin' seasick.
Ah, Mr. Wooley,
I'm not a forward woman.
All my life
I've been shy and bashful, just a rosebud afraid to bloom.
But now I'm takin' the bull by the horns!
Sit down!
I've been tryin' to convey to you in an indirect way that I'd consider matrimony.
That is, after you've been here a bit.
You mean, me and you get married?
Will ya?
Shh.
We shouldn't let the children hear this. Uh-uh.
No!
Duke? Duke!
The widow wants to marry me. Well, congratulations.
My little pal embarking on the sea of matrimony. Stop, stop.
I just made that trip, and
I am not going to get married.
I wouldn't be so hasty. There's ways of making you change your mind.
And you too!
Now get to bed.
There's work to be done in the morning.
Watch 'em, Wolf!
I don't like the looks of this. Should we make a getaway?
Get down.
Wait a minute.
That dog knows what we're talking about.
How does the dog know you said "getaway"?
Duke, don't say those words.
Nice doggy, nice doggy.
Lie down. Lie down.
Uh-oh!
Hey, Duke,
I think I got him fooled.
When he ain't looking, we'll make a g-e-t-a-w-a-y.
How do you like that?
He can spell too.
Chester, we've got to find some way of getting rid of that dog.
Duke, fire stick.
Right.
Nice doggy. Nice doggy. Hold it.
Nice doggy.
Sit still.
You go out and open up the door. Hold him.
Nice doggy.
Don't bite.
Look, doggy.
Show him the stick!
Doggy, c'mon.
Take it easy now.
Nice doggy.
We were just on our way to bed.
Nighty-nighty-nighty.
Hey! Hey!
That ain't fair. It's cold down here, and you've got your coat on.
Why haven't you,
Mr. Wooley?
It's time you were dressed.
There's water to be drawn, the cow to be milked, the chicken coop fixed, the fence whitewashed.
I'll get the children up to help me. Don't you dare!
After all, you're not their father, Mr. Wooley.
Or... has your heart softened?
No, ma'am.
Then get to work.
The lower forty needs plowin', the harness needs sewin'.
If I do all that today, I'll have nothing left for tomorrow.
Don't worry,
I'll think of somethin', unless you've reconsidered my offer of marriage.
Mrs. Hawkins, marriage is nothing but a three-ring circus.
First the engagement ring, then the wedding ring... and then "suffer-ing. "
Duke? Duke!
I'm not gonna take the bed. What do you want?
The widow's awful mad.
She's gonna work my head off.
Will you help me? All right, I'll help you.
I'll stay here and watch the kids.
Ohh!
Here's the water.
Now look what you've done!
No water, no breakfast.
Now get goin'!
Here's the water.
Pour it in the kettle. Yes, ma'am.
Oh, boy, am I full. Oughta be after all those pancakes.
How 'bout those six eggs he ate?
Aw, shut up.
Mrs. Hawkins? Dinner will be at noon.
I haven't had my breakfast. Them that ain't here on time don't eat.
If I don't eat, I can't work. It's your own fault.
Mr. Wooley,
I'm a tenderhearted woman.
I'm filled with the milk of human kindness.
I'm overflowing with the love of mankind.
Mine is a tender heart, ever ready to take into its fold... the tired, the sick, the weary.
Do you get what I'm driving at?
Yes, ma'am, but you're trying to hitch up to the wrong horse.
Why don't you make Duke do some work? I hate to admit this, but I had to tell Mrs.
Hawkins about my heart trouble.
Heart trouble? Don't shout like that.
You, you... No, no. Work makes me sick.
I guess I'll just have to lie around.
That won't be hard. You're the best liar around these parts.
Don't talk to Mr. Eagan like that. Get to work.
Betsy needs shoein' so
I can drive her to town.
The children will meet you in the barn and point her out.
Now git!
Mrs. Hawkins...
Git!
Heart trouble.
Wish I'd have thought of it.
Which one is Betsy? That one? Ah, that's Betsy.
Your mother said
I got to shoe her.
Land sakes, what's the commotion?
Mr. Wooley's shoeing Betsy, so he thinks.
Mr. Wooley, what on earth?
I had to lend her mine.
Ma!
Ma! Ma!
Ma!
Ma.!
Ma!
What are you making all this noise for? I can't sleep.
Give me that brush.
Ma!
Mrs. Hawkins, I'm not going to do it anymore. I'm getting dishpan hands.
It's your own fault.
Keep on scrubbing. Ma! Ma!
Get to the front quick.
There's gonna be trouble.
Juanita's talking with Jake Frame, and I just saw Jim Simpson comin'.
I've had enough trouble with Jake Frame.
Wooley, chase him off the place. Get goin'!
Mr. Wooley, when I tell you to do something, don't stop and play.
C'mon!
Mr. Wooley, I want you to throw that ornery skunk off my property.
I was fixin' to do that,
Mrs. Hawkins.
Why don't you start? This is a family affair. Throw him out!
Mr. Frame?
He don't wanna go.
Jake came to get my answer about coming to work at the Round-Up.
There's that matter of $1,100 owed me by your late husband.
It's generous ofJake to give me a chance to pay off the family debt.
Young lady, as long as I'm your guardian... you will never step inside that saloon.
Good for you,
Wooley!
Watch out for the flowers. Hey.
I've got Hawkins's IOUs.
IfJuanita doesn't work for me, somebody else is going to work off that debt.
Working in a saloon might be good experience for a girl. According to the law, Wooley, that's your responsibility.
But I work here all day!
You'll work for me at night.
Be at the Round-Up at 7:00.
The widow's on the warpath.
You better do something.
Do you think she could use a 75-year-old man? 75?
That's how old I'm gonna be before I pay backJake Frame.
Talking about money, this is all the money I've made since I've been working here.
Some guy tipped me a big penny and thought he was doing me a big favor.
Say, that's a $20 gold piece.
Chester, we're on our way.
We'll ride that to California. Ain't it a little small for both of us to sit on?
I'm going in that poker game. Then watch my smoke. Suppose you lose.
Oh, no, certainly not.
With your help, I can't.
Come here.
Well, what do you boys do?
Bet 50.
I'll see that and up it 100.
I'll call that, and I'll raise it 100.
Let's bump it again.
I'll see that... and up it another 100. That's all for me.
I'll call that.
I got a straight.
All blue, boys. Back to the mines for me.
What do you know?
Sure had a lucky streak.
How much did we win? Well, not enough to pay off everything, but a couple more games like this and we're on our way to California.
Cash me in.
Look, don't let Frame know that we won this money.
Frame.
That's me.
Frame!
Frame. Here, put your ashes here.
I'm so busy and so tired,
Mr. Frame.
Looks like you had a streak of luck, Eagan.
How 'bout you and me sitting down to a couple of hands?
He can't. He's gotta go home right away. Mrs. Hawkins is waiting.
Oh, no, I ain't.!
Oh, yes, you...
I'm here to see you,
Frame.
You and me's got to have a showdown about Wooley. Stay where you are!
This day and night work ain't a-workin' out.
He no more gets through working for me, when he goes to work for you.
Then he no more gets through working for you, when he goes to work for me.
He'll be an old man before his time. My offer still stands.
I'll be glad to replace him forJuanita. Juanita's staying home.
In that case, we can't do business.
I was just talkin' to Eagan about a poker game.
We'll play it three ways.
We get a stack of chips.
Eagan puts up his roll against our interest in Wooley.
Whoever wins gets the money and full possession of Wooley.
You can count me out.
Duke, go ahead and play. If you win, I'm free. No, I...
Yeah, yeah.
All right, I'm in!
How 'bout you, Mrs. Hawkins?
I don't believe in gambling.
Gambling's a sinful, crime-breeding curse. Where are the cards?
Sit down, Mrs. Hawkins.
I'll take over, Joe.
There you are.
Wait a minute.
Women first.
How 'bout
Mrs. Hawkins dealing?
All I know about cards is what
Hawkins told me. I never played before.
We won't have any trouble with her. Certainly not.
You never played cards before?
Uh-uh.
Cut 'em. Cut 'em? Where'd you learn that?
Hawkins. Hawkins. You heard what the lady said, cut 'em.
Ante up.
Hawkins.
Hawkins!
Hawkins!
I'll open.
I'll stay.
What do I do now?
Give me two cards.
I'll take one.
I'm standin' pat.
Hawkins?
Two reds.
Well...
I'll see your two and I'll raise you two.
I don't want to cast any reflections, but... a person has to think twice before buckin' luck like yours.
You may have me beat and then again you mightn't.
Wooley, stop skitterin'!
And put that spittoon down.
I gotta...
Put it down!
I'll see your bet... and sweeten it a little.
I'll stay.
Well...
I'll see that... and I'll raise you two.
I'll tell you what.
Let's get this over with in one hand. Shoot the works.
All I can lose is Wooley, and that ain't much.
I'm in.
Overworked. Let him lay. He needs the rest.
You pay him.
Sure.
I have invested my cash in Widow Hawkins's property.
I've got a fat deal there.
Duke?
Pardon me.
We've got to get out, or I'm gonna be a bride. Beat it!
I'm tryin' to do a little promoting. A lot of"symphony" I get.
Go ahead!
Sweetheart, how would you like to finance an expedition to California?
Wooley, come here.
Would you excuse me, please? Okay, bub.
I thought you went home with the widow.
I did... but I came back again.
Mr. Frame, I wish you'd a-won me in the game.
Working here is much easier than marrying her. So that's it.
Wooley, I'm beginning to really feel sorry for you.
How would you like to earn a couple of fast horses and a stake to California?
If you'd give us the horses, you can forget the steak.
I'm not hungry, just tired.
A miner friend is getting worried about the amount of gold he's got.
If you can get the information from your friend, Jim Simpson, as to when the next bullion shipment is coming through,
I can ship my friend's gold along with it.
If I ask him that, you'll give us the horses? That's right.
I'll go over and ask him.
Don't give him any reasons.
My friend wants to keep it confidential. Oh, a secret.
You don't want the stage-holdup guys to find out about it.
That's right.
I won't tell them.
I won't tell nobody but you.
I'm smart.
I got brains I haven't used yet.
Well, don't let 'em go to your head.
Hello, Chester! Just the man I'm looking for.
What'll it be? A shot of milk. Make it a double.
What do you want to talk to me about? Shh, shh.
When is the next gold shipment coming in? Why do you want to know?
Mr. Frame says
I mustn't tell.
But if I find out, he will do me a big favor.
Oh. Well, in that case,
I'll be glad to help.
The next shipment's due on... Thursday. Thursday?
Oh, good! Let's have a drink on that.
Thursday.
Good luck.
Thursday.
Thursday.
What's up? You know the gold's comin' through on Wednesday.
We can set a trap for Frame and his gang the day after... and catch 'em robbing the coach red-handed.
California's the land of golden opportunity.
You'll have a stocking full of gold!
I've got that now, and I'm gonna keep it.
Duke, we're practically on our way to
California. What are you talking about?
The gold shipment is coming in Thursday.
All I've got to do is tell Frame.
He'll give us horses and the money.
You can't tell him that.
He's the one they suspect.
Suspect of what? Of all the stagecoach robberies.
Oh, what am I gonna do? Tell him the shipment's going through Wednesday.
You'll be doing yourself and the
Citizens' Committee a big favor.
Tell him Wednesday?
Yes!
When he finds out, what will he do to me?
We'll be on our way to California. C'mon.
Mr. Frame... Wednesday. Good.
When do we get the horses? They'll be in the barn Wednesday night... after I've checked your information.
Mr. Frame...
You and your big ideas.
Now I'm in worse trouble.
If you tell Frame the truth, think of the hole it'll putJim in.
Duke, if Frame finds out I'm lying, think of the hole he'll put me in!
I was just coming home.
I'll take care of you later. Where's
Juanita? She should be home in bed.
Keep your hands in your pocket
She should be, but she ain't.
That's her voice! She's in there. We just left.
Now you're going back in.
Find Jim Simpson and bring him here. Lead the way, Wooley.
You heard what Ma said!
"Lead the way, Wooley. "
Make the cash box ring ting-a-ling
Before the night's any older
Set 'em up, Bill and fill up the till
If you have gold then you're welcome
Juanita? Juanita!
Shut up, yourselves!
You can have what's nice if you have the price
Wooley, drag her off that stage!
Me?
Yes, you!
Ain't you the one that forbid her to set a foot in this place?
Go on!
Go ahead!
You've got everything I want Juanita?
Your mama wants you to go home! Sit down!
Get her off there,
Wooley!
Juanita, you've gotta come home with the family.
Juanita, come on home.
Your mama wants you!
Juanita, c'mon home! Wait a minute. Frame says let her stay.
I say, take her out!
Stop that!
Ow!
Ohhh!
Leave that child alone!
Are you gonna let her get up on that stage?
Are you? Go ahead and shoot me and inherit this family.
Go ahead.
Not me.
Oh, c'mon. Oh, no. I don't want 'em.
You don't want 'em?
Quiet, all of you.
He don't want 'em!
Oh.
Anybody else want my job?
Eh?
No.
Eh? Anybody wanna take my job?
Juanita, you heard your mother. Home.
C'mon. Home. Come on!
Wooley!
Look at that.
Not a man in town who'd dare lay a hand on him.
Jim, are you thinking the same thing I am?
I am.
There you are, Chester.
Now you can take your place with the famous sheriffs of the West.
Why didn't you hire one of them? They're all dead.
They're all dead? Dead!
Don't worry, Chester.
Keep this picture and show it when you have to,
and you'll bear a charmed life.
Suppose I should happen to meet some nearsighted gunman?
That'll be his tough luck. Oh, I see.
If he kills me, he'll have to take care of the widow.
That would make him a dead duck.
And me too.
Where's the sheriff?
Where's the sheriff?
There's gonna be lead flyin'.
Some drunk's fixin' for a fight.
Chester?
Where'd he go?
He went thataway.
Chester, get up.
This is your big chance.
Tell 'em to stop the shooting, or you'll run 'em all in! Show 'em you're not afraid.
Throw out your chest.
They'll fill it full of holes.
Go ahead! Don't push!
All right, don't push.
I didn't get this badge for nothin'.
Go ahead.
That boy's got what it takes. I don't wanna go.
I'll go!
You get us some law and order, Wooley, and we'll get the railroad to come through Wagon Gap yet!
I'm donating you in the interest of good government.
Me and the family are with you. I'm depending on it.
Oh, yes.
Ohhh.
Mrs. Hawkins? Oh, go on down there and act like a sheriff, or I'll send you to the ranch and really put you to work. All right.
Law and order.
If you had any nerve, you'd go in there and stop them yourself.
If this doesn't work... You'll think of something else for somebody else to do.
I'm in town for a good time, see?
I'll blast your heads off! Stop disgracin' me!
Haven't you got any red blood in your veins? Yes, and I'm gonna keep it there.
Go on in!
Don't move, anybody.
If you're tired oflivin', we'll shoot it out.
I don't want another word outta any of you!
Oh, no, you don't!
Now you fellows in here will have to stop shootin'... because you're makin' a lot of noise.
The horses are jumpin' up and down, scarin' the women.
Now remember... don't aggravate me.
No more shootin'.
Now look, everybody!
This shooting has gotta stop.
Hey, little boy.
You! Fat little boy.
You!
Come here, little boy.
What're you doin' wearing a man's pants?
I'm the new sheriff.
I want law and order.
You take care of the law, and I'll order.
What'll you have? I don't drink whiskey. It goes to my head.
That's just great.
I'll put it on your head, and I'll shoot it off.
That's much better.
The other way I get sick.
What am I sayin'? Get it back up there, or I'll drill you!
Mister, please don't.
I didn't want this mess.
I didn't ask to be sheriff.
It's all her fault.
Go ahead and shoot me.
You can have her.
The Widow Hawkins.!
That drunk I'm not.
Everybody up! Everybody up! You heard...
Shut up. Get those tables up. Yes, sir.
Put your shootin'irons on the table.
Get 'em up there.!
Hey, you, get this roof fixed!
You heard the sheriff.
Get this roof... Shut up.!
From now on, I want you all to treat me with respect... and very little of that.
Go on back to your tables.
You heard the sheriff.
Shut up!
Yes, sir.
Go on!
You heard the sheriff!
Land sakes, he's done it.
That's my boy. You can all go back to your homes.
There'll be no more shootin' in Wagon Gap.
The sawed-off runt's scared.
What sawed-off runt are you calling a sawed-off runt?
You, fatso. Any objections? Yeah!
Oh, I must've meant somebody else.
I guess you did.
Yeah.
Here.
You're too young to smoke cigarettes!
Just a minute.
I don't want you calling anybody a sawed-off runt, or I'll run you outta town.
And I'm the sawed-off runt that can do it too! Yes, sir.
Chester, you're wonderful!
I'm proud of you. Ma'am, while
I'm wearing this badge of office,
I'll have no huggin' and chalkin' in public.
And another thing, that goes for any other place too.
Mr. Wooley,
I'm apologizing.
Don't let it happen again, ma'am. I won't, Chester.
See what I mean?
I'm not to be trifled with.
I wouldn't overdo it. If you get the widow mad, she'll really pour it on.
Oh. So you're still hangin' around... tryin' to tell me what to do. Oh, now...
Listen, you! If you don't start working and show some means of support,
I'm gonna run you in as a vagrant! Chester, I'm your pal.
You owe everything to me.
And I'm a man that pays off.
I'm gonna start paying you off.
I'm gonna make you my deputy.
You really are my pal! You like that?
Swell. Your first duty is get to the ranch and take over my chores.
Me? Yes, you! You've been bossing me around long enough.
The worm has turned, and every dog has his day.
Now get out! Just a minute. Ohhh!
Partner, when you say that, smile.
Morning, Sheriff.
Good morning, Sheriff.
Good morning, ladies.
Howdy, Sheriff.
Hello, Joe.
Juanita, how are you?
Where's your mama?
She just came into town.
She's right over there.
Good-bye.
Yoo-hoo.! Sheriff Wooley.
I brought your dinner.
It's roast beef today. Just when
I was in the mood for chicken!
Now... I got chicken stewin' for supper.
I'll send Eagan back... Never mind, no need. Roast beef will do.
You wait here for me. I'm going to the saloon to stop them from fighting.
They're not fighting. I know, but why wait until the last minute?
I'll be right back. I've gotta see somebody about something.
Hey, there's the sheriff.
The sheriff!
The sheriff.
You don't all have to stop talkin' on account of me. Then c'mon, boys.
Shut up!
What'd you say?
I didn't say nothin'.
Well, don't say it again.
C'mon, folks, everybody have a good time!
Enjoy yourselves. But don't nobody sneak up behind me.
Put the gun away! Chester, the widow is working me to death.
So? We've gotta get out of town. Tonight, you arrest me.
Then we can get away while the town's asleep.
You like that? Only the part about putting you in jail.
You're starting to like it? Yes.
Being sheriff has its advantages.
Listen, Chester. Get your hands off me. Get 'em off!
Ahem.
I've had enough of your flirting.
If another man even looks at you, I'll kill him.
Why, you...
Hello, Sheriff.
Have another one.
It's on me.
Chester, you're living in a fool's paradise.
It's not you they're afraid of, it's the widow.
And speaking of the widow, she's out to marry you or else.
Or else what? Or else she'll find somebody else to marry.
Then what? Without her protection, you'd just be another little fat man... and a lovely target for these men you've been pushing around.
Who would want to marry the widow?
Who? Who? Nobody.
C'mon, everybody.
Drinks are on the sheriff!
Who would marry the widow?
Judge, sit down and have a drink.
It's a little crowded over there. But it's free at the bar.
Bartender, milk for everybody. Milk?
What's the matter?
Any objections?
Milk!
Milk. I should've listened to you in the first place.
I have something else I think you'd like to listen to.
Have you heard the news about the railroad coming through the widow's property?
No.
They're buying her property for a right-of-way.
You don't say.
That'll probably make her the richest woman in the state.
Hmm.
Bottoms up.
Bottoms up!
Drink up. This stuff will ruin a man's stomach.
So will this.
Looks like the little fat boy is gonna keep dealing us misery.
Worry about him later. Right now, we've got the stage to think of.
Hey, Duke.
What's the matter?
What day is today?
Wednesday.
I thought so.
Jim, is Frame and his gang gonna be fooled!
What're you getting at? You know you told me the gold was comin' in tomorrow?
I told 'em it was coming in today.
Pretty smart, huh?
Send 'em on a wild-goose chase.
The gold is coming today! What?
That wild-goose chase of yours is gonna lay a golden egg... for Frame.
Head off the stage before it reaches Dead Man's Pass.
I'll round up the men and follow.
I get it.
We stop the stage.
The bandits are waiting for the stage.
And then you show up instead of the stage. That's well-staged.
Exactly.! Providing you reach the stage.
Don't worry. I ain't got that for nothin'.
Madam, you'll have to get down off that buckboard. We're after the bandits.
C'mon, you'll have to make it snappy.
What do you mean we're going after the bandits?
You wanna play tag with the bandits, go ahead.
Just a minute.
Take it easy.
I deputized you, didn't I?
Now get in there.
Wooley, I'm agin the whole idea.
When you start ridin' by those bandits, they're liable to start shootin'.
Don't worry. They're not crazy. Well, I am worried.
I'm just sentimental enough not to want my intended shot up.
Madam, it's about time you and I had an understanding.
You may be intending, but I'm not.
Now step aside and let me do my duty! Don't rile me!
It's me protecting you. If you want to keep that protection, you better be thinking about us gettin' wed.
I got all the protection
I need... right here.
Go home before I throw you in the hoosegow for tryin' to scare the sheriff.
Mrs. Hawkins, I've been considering making you a proposition.
Ain't got time, Judge. I can wait.
Wedding bells and train whistles... most melodious.
Yes, indeedy.
What're you slowin' down for?
Let's not pass up this chance.
We have horses and a wagon.
Nobody's watching.
California's out that way. What kind of a sheriff do you think I am?
I was put in office to uphold the law.
You're my deputy, and you're gonna help me!
Sure, the bandits might not shoot you, but it's open season on me.
You got nothin' to worry about.
You're safe as long as
I've got this picture.
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
The picture's gone.
Gone?
It's gone.
Duke, don't go another step.
Hold the horses.
Don't go no further, Duke.
The bandits are right down that road. Should I keep going?
No. No!
Duke, which way does that road go?
To California.
California?
California.
Over there.
The widow.!
Just had a faint notion... you'd be heading this way once you found the picture gone.
Let's ride back together.
You and me can discuss terms for keepin' my protection.
What do you say? Giddyap!
Mr. Wooley?
Mr. Wooley!
Hurry up.
Get down off of there.
Keep your hands up.
Get over here.
Frame.
Frame!
The sheriff!
Mr. Wooley?
Mr. Wooley!
The widow!
Giddyap!
Wooley!
Now we lost the gold. Why didn't you shoot the sheriff?
Why didn't you?
Me?
And have her chasin' me instead of him? Uh-uh!
Where's the sheriff?
It's here, Jim.
He did it!
He saved the gold! If I wouldn't have seen it, I wouldn't have believed it.
Aw, shucks.
It was nothing.
I went for my guns, and they went for the hills. Or vice versa. Wooley.!
Wooley. Wooley!
You're a hero.
I seen it with my own eyes.
You don't need my picture to be brave. How'd...
But I'd like you to have it, Chester, to keep close to your heart.
Thank you, ma'am.
I sure will.
Those bandits were Frame and his gang! I recognized 'em.
This is it. They're probably on their way back to the Round-Up.
Phil, take a bunch of men and ride ahead. We're gonna get 'em.
There's no need of bloodshed.
I'm gonna bring that gang in single-handed. You're only one man!
There's only one gang.
I'll see you all later.
What happened? How do you get outta here? Get on your horse.
Fine bunch of softheaded idiots I tied in with.
I didn't notice you taking a shot at him. Leaving town, I see.
It's all your fault.
You and your laws!
That sheriff's got everyone hog-tied.
Not necessarily. If someone would marry the widow, that would relieve the culprit of his responsibilities, also his power.
Any of you boys want to cut yourselves in? I'd rather leave.
I was speaking of myself. I thought you could hold your liquor.
I'm cold sober, Jake. It's just I desire to settle down in my declining years.
Although the money the little woman will receive from the railroad...
which is coming through her property...
has a slight attraction.
So that's it.
If anybody's in line for that money, it's me.
As the one who really killed
Hawkins, it's high time I confessed.
I'll thank you to appoint me the family guardian. No deal, Jake.
That's hearsay testimony, and I can't accept it as evidence.
I'll shoot the butterball and inherit the family from him!
You'll have to beat me to it.
Hey, the sheriff is coming to take you in.
Order! If we're not careful, we'll be shooting each other.
The judge is right.
It's every man for himself.
But the shot closest to the heart wins.
To avoid argument, mark your bullets.
This thing's got to be done nice and legal.
Wait a minute!
Chester, go on in there, but bring 'em out alive.
Don't worry 'bout me.
Worry about yourselves.
Take cover. I don't want any of you gettin' hurt.
Go on, take cover!
Here's to the widow. And her money.
May the best shot win.
Here's where I get rich.
I never missed a sheriff in my life. Here's to it!
Hey!
Here he comes.
Frame, you and your gang come out with your hands up, or I'm a-comin' in a-shootin'!
Now listen, Frame, someone is liable to get hurt!
Those dirty skunks, shootin' at Mr. Wooley!
Isn't it about time somebody on our side used a gun? It is.
Phil, take 10 men and break in through the back.
Come with me. We'll draw their fire to keep 'em up front.
Wooley, you stay here with the women. Thanks.
Jim Simpson and the Citizens' Committee.
Barricade the doors and windows.
Get back here, you yellow-livered skunks!
This brawl's gonna decide who runs this town, and it's time you started picking sides.
Unless something or somebody draws their attention,
Jim and them fellers are goners!
I'll do it! They won't dare shoot a woman.
No. You have a family to think of.
Chester here'll do it.
Shut up!
But I didn't say...
I didn't say anything.
That's in case you do.
Duke, tell Phil to hurry.
Jim needs help.
When Chester gets there, they'll stop shooting atJim, but I'll go.
You sure this is gonna work?
Even Frame wouldn't shoot a woman.
Why don't we all go? That's a good...
Wooley, get goin'.
Pick up the clubs, girls.
Lead the way, Wooley.
Go on, lead the way!
Hold your fire, men.
Hold it.
Hold your fire!
You women go home where you belong. This is a man's fight.
All right, girls. Forward.
Frame, we're coming in.
The sheriff.
Ohhh!
Hey... Hey...
Hawkins.
Duke!
Oh!
I'll show you we'll have law and order in this place.
Oh, you poor little thing.
Frame!
Come on.
Come on.
You might as well quit, boys.
You're all through in this town.
Corral 'em all and take 'em to the hoosegow.
I'll see that you all get life and maybe longer!
The federal marshal will take care of that.
We're ridin' the bunch into Butte to turn 'em over.
Okay, you got my permission.
C'mon, everybody.
You better come along.
I wanna talk to you.
Mr. Wooley, the citizens of Wagon
Gap are deeply indebted to you.
You're a fine man, and you've been carrying another man's burden.
Frame just confessed he was the man that killed Hawkins.
Chester, at last we're on our way.
Mr. Wooley, I was kinda hoping you might have reconsidered... about hitchin' up. California, here I come.
In that case,
Judge Benbow,
I accept your proposal of marriage.
Let's go.
Just a minute.
Judge, in regards to the railroad...
How'd you know? Just got the offer this morning.
It's gonna make me the richest woman in these parts.
You chump. If you'd a-married the widow, we wouldn't have had to work the rest of our lives.
You wouldn't, but she have found somethin' for me. You never do anything right.
I don't? Didn't I clean up all the bandits?
Didn't I make the town of Wagon
Gap safe for women and children?
So safe that nobody even has to carry a gun?
Giddyap!
Fun, fun, fun
And fancy-free
Da, da, dat
Da, da, dat, doit
Full of fun and fancy-free
That's the way I wanna be
I don't let my troubles trouble me
Dau, dau, dau
Dau, dau, dau
Fancy-free
Full of the, full of fun
Got no time to worry none
Too busy singin' in the sun
Sweet sun
If you should have a chronic ache
Pills won't make you strong
The only tonic you should take
Is a teaspoonful of song
So if you'd really like to be
Happy-go-lucky, just like me
Drown your frowns, my friend and you will see
You'll see
That you'll be full of fun
And fancy-free
Come along,
Lend an ear
See it for yourself
Meet a guy who's got a song
Troubles are on the shelf
He's so happy all the livelong day
Livin' life the simple way
Knowin' it's the only way to be
Just full of fun
Full of fun and fancy-free
Just full of fun
Full of fun and fancy-free
Everyone keeps askin' me
My recipe for livin'
It's simple as the ABC's
And hardly seems worth givin'
I've tried it out in every way
It always sees me through
It's made me what I am today
That's why I'm tellin' you
- I'm a happy-go-lucky fellow
- Ooh, doo, doo, doo
- Full of fun and fancy-free

You can make the whole world seem mellow

With titles five feet wide

- Doo, doo, doo
- I like the lighter side, yes, sir
- Hooray
La, da, da, dee, la, da, da, dee Uh-oh!
Don't let my troubles trouble me
Don't cross a bridge or peek 'round the corner
Until you're there
Just learn to smile and in a while
You'll find trouble's a bubble of air
Get a happy-go-lucky feelin'
You know, you worry too much.
In fact, everybody worries too much.
Here. Just look at the morning paper.
Turn to any page.
You'll find the whole world worryin'... about some future age.
But why get so excited?
What's gonna be is gonna be.
The end of the world's been comin' since 1903.
That's, uh, B.C., of course.
Don't cross a bridge or peek 'round the corner
Until you're there
Just learn to smile and in a while
You'll find trouble
You bet, you'll find trouble!
Oh! Aah! Ohh!
Take it easy, son.
Why, you're just a bundle of nerves.
You see? Jumpy as a cat!
Comes from always rushin' into things.
Hmm! Now what have I done?
I guess I don't know my own strength.
Sorry to upset you, miss.
Have you on your feet in a jiffy.
- Upsy-daisy.
- Mama!
Your mama isn't here, honey.
But if I can be of service, the name is Cricket.
Uh, J. Cricket. You can call me Jiminy.
Oops! Sorry! Ha-ha.
Oh. Howdy, chum.
Why so glum?
Say, what's the matter? You worried about somethin' too?
Tsk, tsk. Never saw such a dismal pair.
A deadpan doll and a droopy bear.
You ought to try my recipe.
Be full of fun and fancy-free.
Life is a song... happy, gay.
So let's have some music.
Come on! What d'you say?
"Bongo"? Now, what in the world is Bongo?
Oh! "A Musical Story
Sung by Dinah Shore."
Well, what are we waitin' for?
Da, da, doo, da
A ringer!
It's a gift.
Da, da, dee, da, la, doh
La, da
Take it away, Dinah!
This is the story...
- of three bears.
- Yeah, I know.
The mama bear, the papa bear, and the itsy-bitsy baby bear.
But it's not the story you expect.
This is a love story.
It's about a little girl bear... and a big, burly, brawny brown bear... who wanted very much to be her boyfriend.
But mostly, this is a story about Bongo.
He was a circus bear.
He was born in the circus, grew up in the circus.
In fact, Bongo was the star of the circus.
In fact, Bongo was the star of the circus.
Why, he could juggle and dance while on a trapeze, walk a tightrope with the greatest of ease.
In jujitsu, he was beyond compare.
Once threw a bull at the county fair.
Super at wrestling and lifting weights.
Outboxed the champs of 1 7 states.
They all packed in from near and far... to see this death-defying star.
With mouths wide open, they watched his ascent... as he daringly climbed to the top of the tent!
Then, for a grand climax, he would gracefully plunge 300 feet... into a wet sponge!
Poor Bongo.
Naturally, you'd think he'd be handled with kid gloves, treated like a king... and pampered like a baby.
But, no! He was tossed around like an old shoe.
Bongo, the bear in the gilded cage.
His thoughts would wander to an imaginary life... far removed from the circus.
Bongo, Bongo, Bongo
Bongo, Bongo, Bongo
Some half-forgotten instinct kept calling him.
For you see, Bongo was a dreamer.
Hey, Bongo! Get going! You're on!
The call of the wild kept ringing in his ears.
Psst! Hey. Bongo!
He couldn't ignore it any longer.
Bongo, Bongo, Bongo
He had to answer the call of the great open spaces.
Come on out, Bongo.
Bongo, Bongo
Come on out, Bongo.
Come on out, Bongo!
Bongo, Bongo.
He was crackin' up!
Bongo, Bongo!
- He was losin' his grip!
- Bongo, Bongo, Bongo!
He had to escape, to get away!
Just gotta get away!
- Bongo, Bongo!
- Gotta get away! Gotta get away.
- Bongo, Bongo, Bongo!
- Gotta, gotta, gotta!
Bongo! Bongo!
Bongo! Bongo!
Bongo! Bongo! Bongo!
Bongo! Bongo! Bongo!
At last he was free.
Free. Free?
Oh! But this was even better than he'd expected!
"Oh, boy, "thought
Bongo, "this is livin'!"
Whoo!
He felt so good, he just had to run around... and jump.
Why, he even tried to growl.
"Oh, boy! A tree. That's for me!"
Just right for climbin' too.
"Oh, well. What if I can't climb a big old tree?
This is still the place for a fellow like me."
- Ooh, ah, ohh
- Just lazy and loafin'... and fancy-free.
- I love to hang around
- Ooh
The lazy countryside
Where things are nice and breezy
With nature's gang around
The lazy countryside
Where life is twice as easy
Where the crickets
You don't hear in the city
Keep a-hummin' in your ear
Oh, so pretty
And it's just too much for words
Listenin' to the chorus of the birds
I like to stay around
The lazy countryside
And while away the hours
Just kind of play around
The lazy countryside
As free as bees and flowers
There's more fun in takin' the sun in
And to roam the spaces wide
It's the place for me
Gee, but it's great to be
'Round the lazy countryside
There's more fun in takin' the sun in
And to roam the spaces wide
It's the place for me
Gee, but it's great to be
'Round the lazy
Countryside
"Oh, boy," thought Bongo,
"this is the stuff."
"To stretch out under a canopy of stars...
"studding the velvet softness of the night.
To sleep in the peace and quiet of the woods."
The stillness of the night descends like a sheltering veil.
Hush. All nature sleeps.
Then came the dawn.
Ohh. Bongo felt as stiff as a board... and as cranky as an old bear.
Bongo was discouraged.
A fine kind of bear he'd turned out to be!
He didn't even know how to act like a bear.
This rough, rugged stuff wasn't for him.
Especially on an empty stomach.
Uh-uh.
Bongo thought, "This is just too good to be true!
"I... I'm either hungry or I'm still dreamin'.
"Ow! I'm awake! It must be true.
Oh, this is much better than dreamin'!"
"This must be heaven.
I-it can't be real!
"It's just too good to be true.
But let me go right on dreamin', as long as I'm with you."
This is too good
To be true
I can't believe it's real
Can it be you
I really see
I never knew
I'd find an angel
And out of the blue
You came to me
You're all the heavenly things
That I've been dreaming of
Don't spread your wings
And fly away
But if you're only
Passing through
Then take me to heaven with you
Or is this a dream
Too good to be
True
This is too good to be true
I can't believe it's real
Can it be you
I really see
I never knew I'd find an angel
Out of the blue you came to me
You're all the heavenly things
That I've been dreaming of
Don't spread your wings
Don't fly away
But if you're only
Passing through
Then take me to heaven with you
Or is this a dream
Too good to be
True
The air grew still with a sudden chill.
No talk, no laughs, no chatter.
With the trees shaking, the ground quaking, the crowd began to scatter.
Out of his lair came the third bear, with murder in his eye.
He took in the scene of love serene with jealousy and surprise.
He was the roughest, toughest, meanest bear.
Lump jaw by name, a villain for fair.
Well... what's this?
It's no dream. It's a nightmare!
"He-He-Hello," was all Bongo could say.
"Hmm. Kind of unfriendly.
Probably doesn't know who I am."
"Just a moment. This is my affair."
"He-He-Hello, Lulubelle, dear."
Gosh, Bongo was surprised.
Why should Lulubelle turn against him?
That was no way for a lady to act.
Lulubelle's feelings were hurt.
All right.
She'd give Mr. Bongo just one more chance.
"What have I done?"
Poor Bongo.
It was too good
- To be true
- Ah
Gone were his dreams.
His world was shattered.
Why hadn't someone ever told him about all of these things... that really mattered?
- And now,
- Ah well, now it was just too late.
He'd never find out that when bears are in love, they always say it with a slap.
When a bird loves a bird he can twitter
When a puppy falls in love he can yap
Every pigeon likes to coo when he says I love you
But a bear likes to say it with a slap
When a whippoorwill's in love he can whipper
All the horses neck and all the turtles snap
Every deer and every dove has a way of makin' love
But a bear likes to say it with a slap
You can ask any bear, Oh
There's nothin' to compare
With a love tap
Strong or weak
So if you're ready for romance and you ever get the chance
- Grab your girl
- Give her your cheek
- So when love comes along Don't be silly
- Doo, doo, doo, doo
- Never ever waste your time like a sap
- Doo, doo, doo, doo
Let the others hug and kiss but the bare facts are this
That a bear likes to say it with a slap
- Slap, slap
- Give me a love tap
Grab your bears and swing 'em wide
Shake their fur and scratch their hide
Give her a slap
Give her a cuff
Go 'round that floor and strut your stuff
He slapped her once and he missed her jaw and he wound up smackin' his mother-in-law
Now here comes Grandpa gettin' in line, And here comes baby bear behind
- Whoo-hoo!
- Oh, oh, oh, oh
When a bird loves a bird he can twitter
When a puppy falls in love he can yap
Every pigeon likes to coo when he says I love you
But a bear likes to say it with a slap
When a whippoorwill's in love he can whipper
All of the horses neck and all the turtles snap
Every deer and every dove has a way of makin' love
But a bear likes to say it with a slap
You can ask any bear
Oh, there's nothing to compare with a love tap strong or weak
If you're ready for romance
And you ever get the chance
Grab your girl give her your cheek
So when love comes along don't be silly
Never ever waste your time like a sap
Let the others hug and kiss but the bare facts are this
That a bear likes to say it with a slap
Slap, slap
So when love comes along don't be silly
Never ever waste your time like a sap
Let the others hug and kiss
But the bare facts are this
That a bear likes to say it with a slap
"I love you, Lulubelle."
"I love you too, Bongo."
You're all the heavenly things
That I've been dreaming of
Ohh don't spread your wings
And fly away
But if you're only
Passing through
Then take me to heaven with you
Ooh
Or is this a dream
Too good to be
- True
- Is it only a dream
Too good to be true
Excuse me. There.
Now who says dreams don't come true? Well!
Three is a crowd, they say.
So I'll drop back another day.
" Miss Luana Patten."
Mmm! Well.
Of course, it's not cricket to read other folks' mail, but...
"A party!
Tonight!" Mmm.
"The house across the way.
"Charlie McCarthy. Mortimer Snerd!
Edgar Bergen?" Huh.
Never heard of him.
"Please come!"
Why, I'd be delighted!
Join the party
Come along
It's a cinch
Can't go wrong
Now's the time to see what you can see
The house is just across the way
Better hurry
Don't delay
You'll be full of fun and fancy-free
Oh, dear. Nanny goats and petticoats.
- I'm a caution.
- Yes, you certainly are.
Tell me, what is the secret of your lovely complexion?
- Well, I... I use saddle soap.
- I see.
Yes. If I'm not being too personal, Ophelia...
- Yeah?
- Uh, how old are you?
- Oh, I'm, uh, a girl my age.
- A girl your age?
- Yes.
- And how old is that?
- Uh, 28.
- Twenty-eight.
I thought you were a little bit older than that.
Well, I knocked off a few years for good behavior.
I don't care for that.
It's kid stuff. Ha-ha.
Well, we're awfully glad you came to our party.
- Well.
- Did you have fun?
Oh, yes, indeedy. I thought Charlie made a pig of himself with that chocolate cake.
- Oh, you're quite right.
- Yes, I am. Yes.
Yes, I agree with you.
- Well, good night, Luana.
- Good night, Ophelia.
- Bonne nuit, Mortimer.
- Uh... ma'am?
- Bonne nuit.
- Oh, yes, ma'am. Yeah, yeah. Bunny...
Uh, bunny, bunny wee, bunny wee. Bun...
Uh... uh, I don't know no bunny wee.
- Good night, Charlie.
- Uh, good night.
- You know, Ophelia, you look so sweet.
- Ah, what'd you say?
- I say, I think you look so sweet.
- Yes?
- I'm going to kiss you good night.
- Oh, help, help, help!
Help, he...
Isn't that a wonderful trick?
Yes, it is. Yes. I wish I could enjoy my first childhood... as much as he does his second.
Now, Luana, how would you like another piece of cake or some ice cream?
- No, thank you. I'm full up.
- Some candy?
- Care for a cigar?
- Me?
How about you, Mortimer?
- Mortimer?
- Uh... I don't smoke.
I don't mean that. Well, what shall we do now? Any suggestions?
How would you like to go down to the city dump and watch me slug rats?
- Certainly not.
- No?
How would you like to hear me tell a story?
Oh, I'd love it.
Wouldn't you, Charlie?
Well, I, uh... y-y-yeah... no.
This is a story that everyone should know.
Yes, but not everyone should tell it. And you know who.
Well, I'm going to tell it anyway.
Now, many, many years ago...
I think I'll run out and wind a sundial.
- You'll stay right here.
- Yes, sir.
Once upon a time, long, long ago...
Funny, nothing ever happens nowadays.
There was a place called Happy Valley.
Now, it was called Happy Valley... because everyone who lived there was happy.
- No! Well, there's a hunk of logic for you.
- Are you listening, Mortimer?
- Uh, Happy Valley?
- That's right, yes.
Now just try and imagine it. Can't you just close your eyes and see it?
Well, I can't see very good with my eyes closed.
My eyelids get in the way.
- You create a picture in your mind's eye.
- Oh.
That's not easy for him.
His mind gets in the way.
- Now try and paint a mental picture.
- Yeah.
I... I painted a barn once, I did.
- Well, that's very interesting.
- Yeah.
- It was... It was a red barn. It was. Yeah.
- Well, forget the barn.
- Yeah.
- And try and picture Happy Valley.
- Well, I'll... I'll work on it.
- That's the spirit.
Yeah. Yeah. I'll work on it.
Let's see, uh... Let's see, now.
It's, uh... Oh, let's say it's about, uh...
Uh, what was the question?
- Happy Valley.
- Oh, yeah! Yeah. That's right. Yeah.
- Let's see, uh...
- Think hard!
Yeah.
Let's see, uh...
Oh, I'm tired. All that work for nothin'.
- Can I try?
- Certainly.
Yes. I think I can see it, Mr. Bergen.
It's beautiful.
Yes, it was one of nature's garden spots, nestled among the green, rolling hills.
Can't you see the lovely brook as it flows through the valley?
Mmm. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
The winding roads, lined with stately trees.
Trees. Yeah.
Lush fields and prosperous farms dot the landscape.
L-Landscape. Yeah.
And high on a hilltop overlooking the valley,
- shining like a jewel, stands...
- My red barn.
No, no. It was something much nicer.
- It was a majestic castle!
- Oh, that's pretty.
And something very precious is kept within these castle walls.
- My
- What is it?
It's a magic, singing harp. Listen.
What a happy day
What a sunny sky, kind of makes you sigh in a happy way
What a very merry day
All the world is gay
When your cares are light and your heart takes flight
And you're swept away
The air is sweet with clover
The clouds are turning over
Oh, yes
They're turning over
Just to show their silver lining
My, what a happy day
Never knew such bliss
Never read of this
In a book or play
What a lovely day
What a great big gorgeous, sumptuous thumping, bumptious
Hum-galumptious simply scrumptious
My, what a happy day
M-M-My, what a happy day
Never knew such bliss
Never read of this in a book or play
What a lovely day
What a great big gorgeous, sumptuous thumping, bumptious
Hum-galumptious simply scrumptious
Oh, my, oh, my
What a happy
Day
Yes, the voice of this golden harp... cast a magic spell of joy and prosperity over the valley.
- But it was too good to last...
- I knew there was a catch in it.
- for one day...
- They built a schoolhouse.
No, no. One day a mysterious shadow crept over the valley.
And then something dreadful happened!
Aaaaaah!
What happened?
When the shadow lifted, the golden harp was gone.
No longer was the valley happy, for without the magic of the harp, all was misery, misery, misery.
Just like the eighth grade.
Desolation spread over the land.
Everything was drying up.
- Dry rot.
- Yes, isn't it?
- Charlie.
- Yes, sir.
The fields of golden corn turned to dust.
Kerplop.
The laughing brook flowed no more.
To think that this was once Happy Valley!
Now it's Gruesome Gulch.
Days pass, weeks pass.
I pass. New deal.
What happened to all the people?
Well, suppose we look in on these humble peasants.
- Is that a peasant?
- That's a cow, stupid.
Well, at least they had milk.
Well, she used to be a good milker. But now...
She's an udder failure.
She was the bosom friend of a once-proud family.
Well, they're certainly out of the high rent district.
And there they are, three poor farmers, gripped by the pangs of starvation.
Still alive, still breathing, sharing a pitiful crust between them.
Share and share alike.
Sharing and staring.
Staring and sharing.
Uh, just tell it, don't ham it.
But are their spirits broken?
Have they lost hope?
Yes. Men facing famine, naught left but beans.
Ahem. Bean, you mean.
If it were one man and three beans...
But, no. One bean and three men.
Well, at least there are no bones in it.
Just look at that miserable creature, doggedly struggling to maintain life, a gaunt, lean bag of bones and feathers.
Truly a picture of despair.
But Donald doesn't whimper.
- Donald doesn't give up.
- Shut up!
I can't stand it!
Easy, Donald. Easy!
There. There, now.
There. Easy, Donald.
I... I'll be all right.
Yeah. I'll be all right.
I'll be all right.
He says he's all right, but I wonder.
He's suffered too much.
What diabolical thought is being hatched in the fevered brain... of this poor, demented duck?
Donald! No! No!
Nice bossy, bossy.
- Nice old cowsy wowsy.
- Donald!
Donald! No, Donald!
Give it here! Let me...
I just gotta eat.
I'm so... hungry.
The little fellow was completely out of his head.
- Cut it out, will ya? I get the idea!
- He was a pitiful sight.
- Weeks without food. Poor Donald.
- Yeah, poor me!
It was all they could do to restrain him.
You see, he had just about reached...
- the end of his rope.
- Yeah.
Oh, it was a sorry predicament indeed.
What to do? What to do?
Well, Donald may be nuts, but he's got the right idea. Kill the cow.
Oh, no, Charlie! The cow was their best friend.
Well, a friend in need is a friend indeed.
- So what?
- So, they need some steak.
No! If you're gonna kill the cow,
I don't wanna hear the rest of the story.
Well, she wouldn't have to know.
They could sneak up on her and surprise her. Yeah, that's what we'll do.
- We'll kill the cow.
- Oh, no, Charlie. You mustn't.
We'll get a stranglehold on her while she's asleep.
- a-a-and then push her off the cliff.
- Oh, no!
I ain't a-gonna listen to the story.
Well, it'll be your fault if they starve to death.
- Why don't they sell the cow?
- That's just what they did.
Well, why didn't you say so in the first place, and save a lot of time?
I could save a lot of time by not telling the story at all!
Your idea is not without merit.
Well, back to the scene of desolation.
Things are beginning to look much brighter now, because as Mickey goes to the village to sell the cow, the thought of prosperity... brings new hope to the famished farmers.
Even Donald has fully recovered, for soon their long-empty plates... will overflow with food.
Hey, look! Turkey, lobster sweet potato pie
Pancakes piled up 'til they reach the sky
Wa-wa, wa-wa, wa-wa, wa-wa
Wa-wa, wa-wa, wa-wa, wa-wa
Oh-h-h-h
I wanna eat and eat and eat and eat
And eat until I die
Turkey, lobster sweet potato pie
Pancakes piled up 'til they reach the sky
Lots of starches
Lots of greens
Fancy chocolate-covered...
- Beans!
- What d'you mean, beans?
Yeah, fellows. I sold the cow for some magic beans!
Beans!
But Donald!
These are not ordinary beans!
They're magic beans!
If you plant these beans in the light of a full moon, do you know what'll happen?
Yes! We get more beans!
- No, no, Donald!
- Magic beans! Phooey!
Poor Mickey, cheated into trading his cow for a handful of beans.
Tsk, tsk, tsk. What a mean trick!
Swindling an innocent farmer out of all he owned... and lying to him, telling him that the beans were magic.
Planted in the light of a full moon!
What a shame to deceive a simple little peasant.
Magic beans, indeed!
- Light of a full moon.
- Bergen? Oh, Bergen!
- What?
- There's something moving.
Why, yes. Well, maybe there is some magic in them!
All right, now let's all keep quiet and see what happens.
Mmm.
And all through the night, it grew, onward and upward.
That thing is a menace to aviation.
And so, with the coming of dawn, we find the bewildered farmers staring at a mammoth castle, miles above the earth.
Their curiosity was aroused, nothing could hold them back.
Who lives there? Man or monster?
Friend or foe?
A princess or a dragon?
Well, search me.
What drew them toward this place of mystery?
Hunger? Desperation?
Or perhaps it was love of adventure.
What a fantastic experience, perhaps mortal man... has never before set foot on this strange land.
- Well, somebody did.
- Oh, gosh! Who made them?
Well, it wasn't Cinderella.
Soon they reached the moat surrounding the castle.
But this didn't stop them. On they went, as if drawn by some irresistible force.
And then, suddenly, without warning, out of the sky above...
Ooh, dragonflies!
Yeah. A-flyin' front and draggin' behind.
- Gee, what whoppers!
- Yeah. Bombers!
Come back and fight!
Finally, they reached the castle.
The hard way.
This was the biggest adventure of their lives.
Forgotten was their hunger, forgotten was their fear.
It took courage to scale these massive steps, to make this journey into the unknown.
But these stouthearted lads never faltered.
Three minds with but a single thought.:
What mystery lurked within those cold, forbidding walls?
What strange spell hovered over this gloomy place?
Will no one answer?
Are they walking into a trap?
Do they go in?
You know, you could stand some rehearsal on this story.
Inside, the tremendous hall was as silent as a tomb.
Not a sign of life anywhere.
Caught with his pants...
- Charlie!
- Caught with his pants...
- Charlie!
- Well, his slip was showing.
They gazed in speechless wonder, almost afraid to breathe.
Suddenly they looked up.
What was it?
Food! Yum, yum, yum, yum!
Let me at it!
Oh! Who's there? Who is it?
- That's the harp!
- Boy, oh, boy!
How'd you get here?
I was kidnapped by that wicked giant!
- Oh. A... A giant!
- A giant!
- A giant?
- A giant!
- Bigger than 40 men.
- Oh, no!
An ogre who had the power to turn himself into anything, man or beast.
That calls for a drink.
It was this heartless monster that swooped down under cover of darkness, carried off the golden harp and...
- brought ruin to Happy Valley.
- No!
Ohh!
Ohh!
- I'm a giant.
- You are not.
- You're nothing of the kind.
- Well, I'm a small giant.
- No, you're not.
- I'm, uh... I'm tougher than 40 men.
- You're not.
- Well... uh, 20 men.
- No.
- No? Ten men?
Aren't you ashamed of yourself,
Charlie? Why do you act like that?
I don't know. I guess it's just a stage I'm goin' through.
- Well, take off that moustache.
- Yeow!
Now go over there and behave yourself.
Yes, sir. Everything I do is wrong.
But why did the giant want to steal the harp?
Because he was cruel and selfish. He didn't care what happened to the valley.
He just wanted someone to sing him to sleep.
Well, why didn't he turn on the radio?
Well, they didn't have radios in those days.
Yeah. That's why they called it Happy Valley.
- What did the giant look like?
- Well, he was...
Oh... I'll try and show you.
He looked something like this.
Ha. Looks like my pig Smedley.
Never mind the self-portraits. Ha-ha.
Well, no, that isn't right.
He... He looked more like... more like this.
There he is now. And the giant came home for dinner, roaring...
- Drunk.
- I was not!
- I mean, he was not.
- No.
Down the castle hall he came, roaring...
Fe, fi, fo, fum!
Fe, fi, fo, fum!
Fe, fi, fo, fum
He, hi, ho, hum
I'm a most amazing guy
A most amazing guy am I
Fe, fi, fo, fum
He, hi, ho, hum
I'm the stuff, I'm tellin' you for here's what I can do
I can change myself into an elf
Fly up high like the birdies
I can disappear into atmosphere
Peekaboo. 'Cause I know the magic wordies
Fi, fo, fe, foy
Fe, fe, fe, fe
Fifi? I don't know no Fifi.
Those are his magic words, you know.
Fe, fi, fo, fum.
- I smell...
- You're telling us!
Wait. He may be smarter than he looks.
Oh, I hope he doesn't find them.
Hey, Giant, you're getting warm.
Well, don't tell him!
- Behind the jar, stupid.
- Charlie!
Pot roast! Chocolate pot roast!
With stispacio...
With dismashmee...
With dismash...
With green gravy.
Feedy, fidey, fodey, fum!
Gesundheit.
Oh, no, you don't! You can't get away from Willie.
I gotcha!
I think I gotcha.
Yeah, I gotcha.
Willie.
What?
He'll have to talk fast to get out of this one.
Well, you leave it to Mickey. Just watch.
Ten, twenty, thirty, forty.
Boy, what a life line!
But what's this here?
What is it? What is it!
Uh-oh! I can't believe it!
- Is it bad?
- Why, i-it says here... that you can change yourself into anything!
Sure, sure! You wanna see me?
I can change myself into the darndest things!
Go on, gimme somethin'.
- Anything!
- Anything?
Anything.
See? Mickey never misses a trick.
- He's got a good idea.
- Well, uh...
Can you change into a fly?
A cute, teeny-weeny, itsy-bitsy housefly?
That's it. A housefly.
Aw, you don't want a fly.
How about a bunny with long, pink ears?
Ha. Well, of course, if you can't do a fly, why, uh...
All right. A fly.
- Why?
- Well, they're, uh...
- Because.
- Okay.
A teeny-weeny fly.
With pink wings.
Now for the magic wordies.
Fe, fi, fo, fum
He, hi, ho, hum
I'm a most amazing guy
Te, ti, te, ti, te, ti
You sure you don't want a pink bunny?
Hey, what is this?
You think you fool Willie.
Yeah, a couple more good ideas like that and they're finished.
Well, I'll admit the little fellows are in a bad fix.
But Mickey isn't one to give up without a struggle.
And with a little luck, they may still pull through.
This isn't the first time
Mickey's been in a tight spot.
Anybody wanna buy a tall, thin mouse?
No, thank you. Uh, I mean no.
Yes, things look pretty dark for the prisoners.
Looks like their goose is cooked.
Oh, Fate may yet deal them a winning hand.
Don't forget, there's still the magic harp. She knows the giant's weakness.
She could be my weakness.
There might still be a chance of escape... if she could only use her magic voice to put the giant to sleep.
If she can't, I know who can.
Shh. Let's all be quiet now, and see.
In my favorite dream
Everyone is so delightful
No one's mean or spiteful
In my favorite dream
Yes, and in my favorite dream
There my heart can go romancing
Dancing to a heavenly theme
But there's something else
I look forward to
It's a secret
But here's a clue
He's my favorite
You know who
You're the hero of
My most favorite
Dream
Oh, mercy. Forgive us.
In his right vest pocket
You'll find the key
The right vest pocket
Go carefully
Oh!
Ah... Ah... Ah...
I'll smash... Ah... I'll smash...
Ah... Ah... Ah...
Ah... Ah... Ah... Ah...
Ah... Ah... Ah...
Where is he?
Hello?
Nightmare.
Oh, boy.
- He made it!
- He did?
- Here he comes with the key!
- Let me have it, Mickey!
Well, it looks like success at last.
Free from the clutches of that terrible monster.
And now to find the beanstalk, climb down and return home in triumph, with a big surprise for Happy Valley.
But wait. Mickey's going to make doubly sure.
He's taking no chances.
Just in case the giant might wake up.
Oh!
Ha. Should have left well enough alone.
Come back here! Come back here!
And there goes the giant!
He's helpless now, tumbling over and over and over, down, down, down, down.
And so with the passing of the wicked giant,
Happy Valley echoed once again with song and laughter.
For with the return of the magic harp, peace and prosperity reigned throughout the land.
- And the people of the valley...
- We know.
Lived happily ever after.
You're a wonderful storyteller,
Mr. Bergen. Isn't he, Charlie?
Simply thrilling.
You're even better than the old-fashioned sleeping pill.
What's the matter, Mortimer?
Oh, the poor giant got killed, that he did.
- I don't like them sad endings.
- Oh, now, you don't understand.
W-Willie was a nice giant, he was.
He just got too big for his britches.
- But you don't understand.
- No, don't touch me.
I'll be all right.
Oh, excuse me.
What I'm trying to explain,
Mortimer, is that Willie the Giant...
- didn't actually exist.
- No?
No. He's a metaphysical phenomenon of your subconscious mind, a phantasmagoria of your mental faculties.
Yeah?
In other words, just a figment of your imagination.
- No!
- Yes.
So there's nothing to be upset about.
Hey! Has anybody seen anything... of a teensy-weensy little mouse?
No. I-I-I, uh...
Oh, Mr. Bergen!
Bergen, speak to me. Speak to me.
What's the matter with him?
Somethin' he ate?
Uh, no. It's, uh...
It's a fig, uh, fig... fig-a-mentation of his imagination.
- No!
- Yeah.
Well, uh, good night, Willie.
Uh, don't slam the roof.
You might wake Mr. Bergen.
Now some folks don't believe in giants
Castles up above
And others say that bears don't talk
And never fall in love
If you really wanna find
Happiness
Peace of mind
Believe in all your dreams
And you will see
You'll be full of fun and fancy
Free and full of fun
And fancy-free
{408}{457}A warm handshake ortwo

{720}{784}You must meet it|Wake up andgreet it
{792}{845}With a gaysong inyourheart
{1701}{1752}Here's an unusual expedition:
{1752}{1858}artists' musicians and writers setting|out for a trip through Latin America...
{1860}{1956}to find new personalities' music|and dances for their cartoon films.
{2343}{2427}Three days later they glided in|to Rio deJaneiro' Brazil...
{2427}{2498}then down to the Argentine'|Buenos Aires...
{2661}{2714}and out across the pampas.
{2829}{2886}At Cordoba' the party divided.
{2961}{3021}Some flew over the Andes into Chile.
{3021}{3069}The others went north|to the Inca country--
{3069}{3131}Bolivia' Peru|and Lake Titicaca...
{3162}{3222}turning away from the modern cities|to find the descendants...
{3222}{3278}of ancient Inca civilization.
{3366}{3463}Eight thousand square miles ofwater|over two miles above sea level...
{3474}{3580}Lake Titicaca has been prominent in Inca|history and folklore for generations.
{3720}{3780}Wood is scarce at this altitude...
{3780}{3858}so the fishermen's boats|are woven of balsa reeds.
{3990}{4084}There's always plenty of colour|and excitement here on market day.
{4182}{4266}These folks come from miles around|to trade their goods...
{4266}{4327}and swap some of the local gossip.
{4458}{4552}The styles run to bright-coloured|clothes and conservative hats...
{4578}{4636}and a rumble seat for the baby.
{4638}{4715}Just the kind of material|the artists were after.
{4797}{4859}Their music is strange and exotic--
{4905}{4980}melodies handed down|from their Inca ancestors.
{5181}{5250}And walking haystacks|are right in tempo.
{5340}{5429}These little syncopated burros|bear the heavy burdens here...
{5448}{5544}because the more dignified llama|will carry ust so much and no more.
{5592}{5685}When his quota is exceeded'|that haughty aristocrat of the Andes...
{5685}{5751}calmly sits down|and refuses to budge.
{5841}{5920}Yes' a llama can make you feel|awfully unimportant.
{6294}{6378}All these impressions' together with the|local colour that had been absorbed...
{6378}{6438}resulted in a little travelogue...
{6438}{6486}seeing the land of the Incas|through the eyes...
{6486}{6552}of a celebrated North American tourist.
{6654}{6742}Lake Titicaca is approximately|1 3'000 feet above sea level.
{6750}{6815}- 1 3'000 feet!|- Hmm' approximately.
{6846}{6951}At this great height' many visitors are|subect to altitude fever' or soroche.
{6954}{7035}- Is that so?|- The most common symptom is dizziness.
{7038}{7087}Dizziness? Aw' phooey!
{7329}{7400}Often followed|by palpitation of the heart.
{7425}{7484}The ears have a tendency to pop.
{7509}{7575}And a peculiar|ringing sound is heard.
{7653}{7702}Fascinating' isn't it?
{7749}{7804}The balsa, or basket boat...
{7809}{7893}is constructed entirely|of reeds tightly bound together.
{7905}{7965}It's built to withstand|the fury of the elements.
{7965}{8056}In fact' it seems to be impervious|to practically everything...
{8109}{8167}except the inquisitive tourist.
{8229}{8289}Crossing the lake|is often filled with adventure.
{8289}{8357}A strong wind|may arise very suddenly...
{8433}{8483}and then stop suddenly.
{8817}{8865}For the artist|in search of local colour...
{8865}{8937}the marketplace presents an|excellent picture ofvillage life...
{8937}{9022}as shoppers and merchants|bustle about the public square.
{9225}{9331}The precipitous terrain in this region|offers no problem to these hearty folk.
{9369}{9441}And we find the people here|divided into two classes--
{9441}{9502}those who walk against the wind...
{9513}{9573}and those who walk with the wind.
{9705}{9753}Yes' wherever the visitor|points his camera...
{9753}{9815}he finds a picture fit for framing.
{9840}{9909}The llama' or "yama"'|is an odd-looking individual...
{9909}{9966}with considerable personality.
{9981}{10053}His master' here' exercises|complete control over him...
{10053}{10103}with a home-made flute.
{11376}{11456}is quickly interpreted|by this wide-awake youngster.
{11796}{11901}The visitor never seems to be satisfied|until he tries on the native costume.
{11904}{11963}And our tourist is no exception.
{12615}{12675}The llama is obviously|not a itterbug...
{12675}{12735}but ifyou want to explore|this precipitous country...
{12735}{12808}he'll solve all your|transportation problems.
{13005}{13077}One soon becomes accustomed|to the low' fleecy clouds...
{13077}{13153}that steal like silent ghosts|across one's path.
{13230}{13317}The gentle undulating gait of the llama|adapts itselfvery nicely...
{13317}{13392}to the swaying motion|of the suspension bridge.
{13413}{13458}Suspension bridge?
{13473}{13507}Oh' no!
{13590}{13650}Far below us' we see the village.
{13686}{13727}Whoa! Whoa-oa!
{13827}{13864}The flute.
{14199}{14261}Give me that flute' ya big palooka!
{14514}{14559}Hey! Take it easy!
{14562}{14603}Whoa! Whoa-oa!
{14682}{14714}What?
{15006}{15078}The traveller should be cautioned|against any reckless behaviour...
{15078}{15126}at this high altitude.
{15126}{15179}Overexertion is dangerous.
{15186}{15261}And above all' one should|never lose one's temper.
{15261}{15312}Shut up' ya big windbag!
{15387}{15445}Get off of me!|Go on' beat it!
{15483}{15522}Doggone you.
{15867}{15927}And finally' the pottery market...
{15927}{15990}where the visitor always drops in...
{16023}{16071}seldom failing to accumulate|a large collection...
{16071}{16153}of the native handiwork'|as he bids a fond farewell...
{16164}{16232}to the land of the Incas'|Lake Titicaca.
{16356}{16416}The flight across the Andes|into Chile...
{16416}{16476}over the highest mountains in America.
{16476}{16556}Plenty to see and remember|on this spectacular trip.
{16572}{16620}Since no cameras are allowed here...
{16620}{16701}the boys have to cover this|from memory and sketches.
{16773}{16849}Impressions of Uspallata Pass|from 1 6'000 feet.
{16917}{16989}These sketches and the stories|told of the pioneer mail planes...
{16989}{17070}that first flew this route|started everyone thinking.
{17112}{17183}First a little plane|began to take shape...
{17244}{17302}with a personality all his own.
{17328}{17407}All agreed that he had|good screen possibilities...
{17412}{17484}and before the plane set down|at Santiago...
{17484}{17536}his life story had begun.
{17604}{17692}Once upon a time in a little airport|near Santiago' Chile...
{17709}{17763}there lived three aeroplanes:
{17763}{17841}the papa plane' the mama plane|and the baby plane.
{17886}{17960}The papa plane was a big'|powerful male plane.
{18066}{18137}Mama plane was|a middle-sized female plane.
{18174}{18249}And the baby plane was|a little boy plane named Pedro.
{18249}{18295}Uh' where is Pedro?
{18321}{18381}Oh' there he is. Maybe someday...
{18381}{18453}he'll grow up to be a big plane|like his father...
{18453}{18530}who carries the mail|between Chile and Argentina.
{18609}{18669}Like all fledglings'|Pedro went to ground school...
{18669}{18725}to learn the ABC's of flying.
{18777}{18851}He studied reading'|skywriting and arithmetic.
{18894}{18943}He was taught anatomy.
{18960}{19012}He also studied history--
{19029}{19077}Pedro! And geography.
{19113}{19214}And in geography' he learned the mail|route between Santiago and Mendoza.
{19221}{19289}Over the mighty Andes'|past Aconcagua...
{19317}{19388}highest mountain|in the Western Hemisphere.
{19413}{19509}One day the papa plane was laid up|with a cold in his cylinder head.
{19596}{19651}So he couldn't fly the mail.
{19656}{19716}And the mama plane|couldn't stand the altitude...
{19716}{19776}because she had high oil pressure.
{19776}{19824}So she couldn't fly the mail.
{19824}{19882}But the mail must go through...
{19920}{19954}I hope.
{19968}{20033}Calli Pedro.|ReaforFlit 2 to Mendoza.
{20064}{20140}"Now' remember' Pedro"'|the mama plane said...
{20145}{20232}"stay out of downdraught|and keep your muffler on tight."
{20256}{20304}And don't go near Aconca--
{20304}{20350}Aconca-- Aconcagua!
{20454}{20507}Flit 2 leaving forMendoza.
{20598}{20654}Allclear, Pedro.|Let "ergo.
{20730}{20799}Give "erthegun, boy!|Gun "er! Gun "er!
{20826}{20895}Don"t loseyouringspeed!|Pullup!!Pullup!!
{20922}{20958}Look out!
{21042}{21102}And so' after a masterly takeoff...
{21102}{21150}Pedro started on|his first assignment...
{21150}{21208}to pick up the mail at Mendoza.
{21258}{21350}Each and every trip through|this pass is an adventure in itself.
{21354}{21425}At this altitude'|you never can tell what--
{21426}{21465}Downdraught!
{21498}{21558}Pulled out of that one all right.
{21558}{21616}Handles himseIf like a veteran.
{21654}{21714}His course carried him|over the Pass of Uspallata...
{21714}{21786}where stands the statue|of the Christ of the Andes...
{21786}{21858}marking the boundary|between Chile and Argentina.
{21858}{21926}So far' so good.|Not a cylinder missing.
{21942}{22023}Pedro was flying on top|of the world when suddenly...
{22038}{22117}his first view of that|towering monarch' Aconcagua!
{22170}{22248}So this was the big bully|they'd warned him about.
{22257}{22305}But he didn't scare Pedro' though.
{22305}{22343}No' sirree.
{22482}{22527}Well' the worst is over.
{22527}{22602}And from now on'|it's clear sailing to Mendoza.
{22614}{22662}Come in against the wind' Pedro.
{22662}{22727}There's your mail.|Easy now. Attaboy!
{22770}{22835}He picked up his mail|like a veteran.
{22842}{22909}Uh-oh! Careful!|That cargo is precious.
{22938}{23013}Pedro was homeward-bound|and ahead of schedule.
{23046}{23123}I'll bet his mother and dad|will be proud of him.
{23130}{23183}Just a natural-born flier.
{23226}{23295}Hmm. Maybe I|shouldn't have mentioned it.
{23547}{23583}Look out!
{23595}{23643}Hope he got that out of his system.
{23643}{23704}Now with good luck and a--|Uh-oh.
{23775}{23847}I was afraid of that.|Hey' Pedro' come back!
{23889}{23988}The little fellow had completely|forgotten his responsibilities. Pedro!
{24024}{24076}Then suddenly' Aconcagua!
{24120}{24214}Its rocky' snow-filled crags formed|the face of a leering monster.
{24252}{24312}The oil froze|in little Pedro's cylinders...
{24312}{24372}and his motor knocked with fright.
{24372}{24440}All those warnings|came back to him now:
{24444}{24521}the treacherous crosscurrents'|the sudden storms.
{25449}{25505}Climb above the storm' Pedro!
{25509}{25579}Never mind the mail!|Let it go! Let it go!
{25581}{25646}Forget the mail!|Climb' Pedro! Climb!
{25716}{25752}Look out!
{25821}{25868}Climb' Pedro! Climb!
{25887}{25959}Get above the storm!|I know you can make it!
{26172}{26243}Drop the mail!|You've got to save yourself!
{26268}{26333}More altitude!|25'000's all you need!
{26367}{26401}Up! Up!
{26433}{26517}Gun your motor! Now ust a little more|and you'll be in the clear!
{26517}{26575}Climb' Pedro! Climb!|Good boy!
{26613}{26676}Good boy!|I knew you could make it!
{26688}{26736}You're all right now.
{26736}{26806}Just level off|and head straight for home.
{26844}{26887}He's out of gas.
{26928}{26968}Pedro! Pedro!
{27072}{27109}He's gone.
{27144}{27196}Back at the home field...
{27198}{27269}Pedro's parents|searched the skies in vain.
{27270}{27345}They knew that he couldn't|have held out this long.
{27345}{27405}Their brave little son was gone...
{27405}{27467}another martyr to the mail service.
{27489}{27553}Poor little fella.|His first flight.
{27573}{27637}It's too bad|it had to end this way.
{27681}{27722}What was that?
{27729}{27793}I wonder if it--|No' it couldn't be.
{27816}{27867}Wait! It is! It's Pedro!
{28038}{28102}Pedro! Petey boy!|Are you all right?
{28134}{28194}Well' don't ask me how he did it.
{28218}{28288}It wasn't exactly|a three-point landing...
{28290}{28347}but he did fulfil his mission.
{28362}{28417}He brought the mail through.
{28422}{28485}The mail'|that all-important cargo.
{28548}{28623}"Having wonderful time.|Wish you were--" Mmm.
{28647}{28695}Well' it might have been important.
{28695}{28751}And he did bring in the mail.
{28791}{28839}And so' the papa plane'|the mama plane...
{28839}{28908}and little Pedro|flew happily ever after.
{28956}{29045}Sailing eastward from Chile'|we cross the Argentine pampas...
{29076}{29149}ust millions of acres|of rich grazing land...
{29220}{29297}the third largest city|in the Western Hemisphere.
{29322}{29370}Buenos Aires is a beautiful city.
{29370}{29453}This is the plaza de Mayo,|one of its delightful parks;
{29478}{29542}the Teatro Colon,|home of the opera;
{29586}{29681}and the stately Congress building'|centre ofArgentina's government.
{29730}{29798}The tallest building|in South America...
{29802}{29852}the Edificio Cavanaugh.
{29898}{29961}Yes' they were really|impressed with the big city...
{29961}{30021}but impressive' too'|was the lure of the pampas...
{30021}{30105}and the Argentine gaucho|as painted by F. Molina Campos.
{30150}{30198}The party were guests|at his ranch studio...
{30198}{30246}where Senor Campos paints the gaucho...
{30246}{30304}with amazing detail and humour.
{30414}{30462}Seeing these pictures made them|more anxious than ever...
{30462}{30525}to meet these caballeros|in person.
{30612}{30672}And they lived up to their pictures.
{30672}{30723}A real Wild West show...
{30732}{30804}but ust part|of the day's work for a gaucho.
{30819}{30897}Sketching these paisanos|in action was no easy ob.
{31020}{31113}But they did manage to get a good|look at the gaucho's equipment.
{31116}{31187}Silver coins decorate his belt'|or tirador.
{31209}{31257}The sheepskin saddle.
{31269}{31317}Soft horsehide boots.
{31341}{31399}This garment's called a chiri .
{31482}{31553}Here the visitors|were treated to an asado.
{31557}{31630}choice cuts of meat;|mate, the Argentine tea;
{31680}{31741}and wine from their own vineyards.
{31746}{31800}True Argentine hospitality.
{31812}{31884}A group of skilled dancers|entertained the guests.
{31884}{31951}Not the modern tango|of Buenos Aires...
{31956}{32024}but the country dances|of the Argentine.
{32028}{32110}The same tunes to which|their grandparents had danced.
{32508}{32568}Notice how closely|these steps resemble...
{32568}{32640}the old-time square dances|of North America.
{32892}{32967}Gathering picture material|here was a pleasure.
{33573}{33621}Another story was under way.
{33621}{33726}And after seeing Senor Campos' paintings|and all this colourful exhibition...
{33726}{33786}we couldn't help but compare|the life of the Argentine gaucho...
{33786}{33840}with that of our own cowboy.
{33840}{33927}And they reached way back|into Texas to find a leading man.
{33927}{33990}From the windswept plains|of Montana...
{33990}{34060}to the sunbaked banks|of the Rio Grande...
{34062}{34137}over countless miles|of mountain and prairie...
{34146}{34238}untouched and unsullied by|the mercenary hand of civilization...
{34266}{34339}roams a tough'|hardy and heroic breed of man:
{34362}{34415}the North American cowboy.
{34422}{34483}Strong' silent and weather-beaten.
{34557}{34601}Howdy' strangers.
{34605}{34665}This colourful cowhand|of the great West...
{34665}{34742}has his counterpart|in the South American gaucho.
{34749}{34837}Over land and sea' over rugged|mountains and dense ungles...
{34881}{34979}down across the equator to the lush'|grassy pampas of the Argentine...
{35001}{35051}the home of the gaucho.
{35097}{35181}Now' the cowboys of both|Americas have much in common...
{35193}{35275}although their costume|differs in a few minor details.
{35277}{35353}We substitute bombachas|for chaps; the sombrero.
{35373}{35421}Then there's the saco,|the tirador...
{35421}{35474}the chiri and the panuelo.
{35625}{35685}Then' finally'|we have the poncho...
{35685}{35746}which ust about covers everything.
{35805}{35889}The gaucho's closest friend|and inseparable companion...
{35889}{35939}is his horse' or pingo.
{36057}{36105}Quickly the gaucho|reaches for his lasso!
{36105}{36189}Twirling the rawhide above his head'|he deftly tosses the noose|about the horse's neck...
{36189}{36237}and easily subdues|the spirited animal...
{36237}{36302}with the help|of the snubbing post...
{36321}{36360}or palenque.
{36393}{36464}Thanks to the palenque,|or snubbing post...
{36465}{36561}the horse is soon brought under|control and is ready for the saddle.
{36681}{36752}While it appears complex|at first glance...
{37050}{37110}adding the cinchas,|bastos, sheepskin' pigskin...
{37110}{37175}bridle' bit and' finally'|the gaucho.
{37254}{37302}When riding the range at night...
{37302}{37387}the saddle may be quickly|converted into a bed' or catre.
{37398}{37429}Bed?
{37554}{37626}One of the gaucho's|favourite sports is the asado...
{37626}{37675}or Argentine barbecue.
{37698}{37754}Over an open charcoal fire...
{37758}{37826}thick' uicy'|tender steaks are prepared.
{37842}{37913}And' amigos'|it fairly melts in your mouth.
{38061}{38133}The gaucho's method|of eating looks quite simple...
{38133}{38203}yet requires|a certain amount of practice.
{38205}{38275}The bread and meat|are held in one hand...
{38277}{38313}the knife in the other.
{38313}{38361}Note the action|ofwrist and elbow...
{38361}{38444}as knife and food synchronize|in deft' graceful rhythm.
{38481}{38534}One' two' bite' cut' chew.
{38565}{38622}One' a-two' a-bite' cut' chew.
{38661}{38721}Yes' it is this wholesome diet|that builds...
{38721}{38798}the gaucho's nerves of steel|and muscles of iron.
{38841}{38901}And now the boleadoras, or bolas.
{38913}{38997}The bolas consists of three lead|weights covered with rawhide...
{38997}{39057}and is often used for sport'|such as capturing...
{39057}{39135}that swift-moving bird of the|pampas' the Argentine ostrich...
{39135}{39175}or avestruz..
{39195}{39255}Unlike most members|of the ostrich family...
{39255}{39327}the avestruz. is not equipped|with ornamental tail plumage.
{39327}{39409}Its slender legs make|excellent targets for the bolas.
{39423}{39467}Did he say bolas?
{39543}{39627}Dashing at breakneck speed' the gaucho|whirls the bolas 'round and 'round...
{39627}{39693}faster and faster'|and then the throw!
{39879}{39958}And now to fully appreciate|this remarkable feat...
{39975}{40023}let us study the action...
{40023}{40093}through the eye|of the slow-motion camera.
{40119}{40174}Note the grace and beauty...
{40179}{40256}of this light-footed creature|in startled flight.
{40311}{40397}With delicate balance and|clocklike precision of timing...
{40419}{40476}man and beast moving as one...
{40503}{40565}display a minimum ofwaste motion...
{40623}{40686}as the whirling bolas are unleashed.
{40839}{40923}Faster and faster!|On and on they spin' closer and closer!
{40923}{40995}Here they come! Be careful!|Get out of the way! Heads up! Watch it!
{40995}{41046}Look out' look out!|Here it comes! Duck' duck' duck!
{41046}{41092}Too late! Too late!
{41298}{41341}And when night--
{41346}{41392}When night falls...
{41403}{41498}the lone gaucho oft-times finds|himseIf far' far out on the pampas.
{41526}{41603}Listen to the melancholy|strains of the triste...
{41610}{41660}a sad' romantic ballad.
{42411}{42471}But the gaucho is not always sad.
{42471}{42555}Come' let us dance to|the lively beat of the chacarera...
{42555}{42617}the dance of the farmer's daughter.
{42711}{42761}Combining the minuet...
{42771}{42837}the bunny hug|and a dash ofumping ive.
{42867}{42930}The pampas version of cutting a rug.
{42975}{43018}And EIMalambo...
{43023}{43117}a solo number in which the dancer|swings out with utter abandon...
{43131}{43213}often described as|perpetual motion below the equator.
{43539}{43612}Traditional dance|of the rooster and the hen.
{43947}{44037}And now' as he sways to|the gentle undulations of EIMalambo...
{44043}{44112}we gently waft|our transplanted cowboy...
{44139}{44187}back to his prairie homeland.
{44187}{44259}Here we leave him|with warm and tender memories...
{44259}{44340}of his visit to the gay'|romantic land of the gaucho.
{44652}{44734}And now from the pampas|to Brazil and Rio deJaneiro...
{44736}{44811}a city of amazing beauty|and a perfect setting.
{45027}{45111}One of the best views of the city|is from the top of Sugarloaf...
{45111}{45191}overlooking Copacabana Beach'|the playground of Rio.

[MUSIC PLAYING]
Oh, hello.
Tom, can't we be friends again?
He wanted it.
He always wanted it.
Tom, I... I hope he's watching us and understands.
He always understood, didn't he?
He was great man, Tom.
People didn't always think so, but my father believed in him from the very first day he met him.
That was years ago.
But he still talks of that day when he drove to Dr. Arnold's home.
Dr. Arnold, please.
Yes, sir.
But he's teaching, sir.
I'll wait.
Please forgive my husband, Mr...
Brown, ma'am.
My husband is a private tutor, Mr. Brown.
He makes it a rule never to interrupt a class.
A very proper man.
Now, Westcott, tell us what you know about our war with the United States.
Oh, that thing, sir.
DR. ARNOLD: Yes, that thing.
Well, sir, the colonists didn't like our tea and so there were a lot of skirmishes.
Well, the colonists didn't fight far and hid behind trees, so our soldiers got disgusted and sailed home.
That's very patriotic, Westcott.
But inaccurate.
Are you eating in class, Baker?
What's the matter with your face?
Toothache, sir.
Take that taffy out of your mouth.
You told me an untruth, Baker.
Remind me to birch you, afterwards.
Yes, sir.
Westcott, perhaps, you had better inform us about the 2nd Punic War.
Oh, yes, sir.
Hannibal crossed the
Alps with his elephants and the Romans came out to meet him.
Does it strike you as odd that you know so much more about something that happened in Italy hundreds of years ago?
No, sir, that's history.
And our war with the United States?
That's just modern, sir.
And like an honest
English schoolboy, you know nothing about it?
No, sir.
Westcott, why did we learn history?
To find out what the
Greeks and Romans did.
Someday it may also be thought useful to know what the English and Americans did.
Very well, boys.
DR. ARNOLD: Tea ready, Mary?
Mr. Brown has been waiting to see you, Tom.
How do you do, sir.
Don't think I've had the pleasure?
No, sir, you haven't.
Brown, sir.
Squire Brown, they call me of Buffington, in the Vale of White Horse.
We're a large family, we Browns.
Not very distinguished, of course, but in our humble way, the backbone of England.
Pinch of snuff, sir?
No, thank you.
No!
The cat will have it.
[SNIFF]
Pity it's dying out.
Mr. Brown, to what do we owe the honor of this visit?
Oh, yes.
You've been very successful here, Doctor.
The most successful private tutor in England.
SQUIRE BROWN: Pity your scope is so limited.
But it has advantages, Mr. Brown.
Here in my own school
I have a free hand.
I can train boys in my own way without interference.
Did you ever hear of
Rugby School, Doctor?
Naturally.
The trustees are looking for a new headmaster.
So I've heard.
And wherever we go one name is brought forward.
Really?
Yes, sir, yours.
Dr. Arnold, I've been sent by the trustees to ask you to stand for election.
But that's impossible.
But try, dear.
The trustees would never accept me.
My ideas are too revolutionary.
But that's just what we want, Doctor.
You know our schools and nurseries are iniquity of vice.
We want a revolution.
Nonsense, Mr. Brown.
Englishmen never want a revolution.
Thomas, please.
That's right, ma'am.
Now you talk to him.
I'll step into the garden and admire the azaleas.
Oh, Thomas!
Think of all you could do.
But we're happy here, Mary...
Our own ways, our own boys.
10 boys.
You're giving your life to 10 boys.
And what would I do with 300.
All the things we've talked about.
All your theories and your plans.
But they're experimental.
They're right.
You know they're right.
I'd turn the whole place upside down.
Of course you would.
If you were headmaster of Rugby you would...
You would change the face of education in England.
300 boys, Mary...
The youth of England.
To teach them to govern themselves, to teach them to know what is right, to mold them as courageous,
God-fearing gentlemen.
Please, sir.
What is it?
I was to remind you to birch me.
[LAUGHING]
The youth of England, Mary.
And it eats taffy in class.
[LAUGHING]
STUDENT: Hello, Thomas.
Hello, sir.
What's he like?
Rum, sir, very rum.
Rummiest headmaster
I ever did see.
Isn't going to be a nuisance, is he?
We can only hope, sir.
But when he opens his mouth, we'll know the worst.
DR. ARNOLD: I come to a great school where all the brothers from every association is splendid and elevated.
But the schools of England are being criticised.
They say that they are corrupted and changed from the likeness of God's image to the likeness of a den of thieves.
And it is for us, for you and for me, to remove that reproach.
And how can this be done?
You who are boys in our schools today may tomorrow govern a great nation.
But those who are to govern others must first learn to govern themselves.
Our schools must no longer be based on tyranny.
The headmaster is the chief tyrant and the assistant master are the lesser tyrants.
They must be based on the determination of each of us.
All just and reasonable beings to do what is right.
And in return for this freedom,
I require your confidence, your confidence and your honesty.
Lying and deceit I shall never forgive you, for freedom demands responsibility.
Those who are oldest and wisest amongst you, the sixth form, will have a special responsibility.
Like officers in the army, you will maintain discipline, you'll encourage the weak, and chastise the offenders.
[WHISPERING] The man's a radical.
But each one of us belongs to a great and a famous school, the reputation of which we are concerned to defend and to improve.
And it is for us to show our fellow men that Rugby is now no longer a school of savage barbarians, but a school of courageous,
God-fearing gentlemen.
I'll give him a year.
I'll give him six months.
Moral principles!
What's a school boy got to do with moral principles?
Feed in one end, beat the other, that's education!
We are safe as houses.
With a headmaster like that, huh!
You can get the lions,
I'll get the bait.
We're courageous
God-fearing gentleman and we're hungry for ducks.
[DUCKS QUACKING]
Hey, I got one!
(SINGING) We'll knock him down and box his ears.
No more laughing, no more glee.
No more sitting on a hardwood seat.
And the dear headmaster, will interfere, we'll knock him down, and we'll box his ears!
Ha, ha.
Hey, you thieving, young rascals, you!
And there they were, as brazen as you please, a-gorging themselves on my fine ducks, what I get four shillings for at market.
That's not true, farmer.
Oh, yes it is.
You're new here, Doctor.
You don't know Rugby lads like I do... liars and thieves who have been stealing my ducks and chickens for 20 years.
Yes, and a very good thing you must of made out of it at four shillings a piece.
You will be paid no more than the market price, two shillings.
That's all, thank you, Mr. Jenkins.
Very good, sir.
Once more, and I beg you to consider your answer very seriously, did you steal those ducks?
No, sir.
We were never near his place.
McPhail?
No, Sir.
Green?
Of course not, sir.
But you were all three together this afternoon?
Yes, sir.
Very well.
This is your knife, I believe, Barrington.
Your initials are on it.
Yes, sir.
You dropped it near
Farmer Jenkins' duck pond.
[BELL RINGING]
DR. ARNOLD: I told you that it was my passionate desire that the boys of Rugby should learn to govern themselves.
But I also told you that I would not tolerate lying or deceit.
For he who governs himself must be honest in thought, in word, and in deed.
But you lied to me!
Expulsion is a serious and a lasting disgrace.
It brings sorrow to your parents and calamity to yourselves.
Rugby is greater than any three of its boys.
And there is no longer an place for you in this school.
You did what you thought right.
It was right, Mary.
It was.
Those boys were liars.
And liars will poison and corrupt.
I cannot begin until
I got rid of them.
There will be more expulsions, more suffering, more misery.
Better to have but 100 boys here, Mary, 60, 30, as long as the few are honest,
God-fearing, courageous.
[BELL RINGING]
If this is modern education, huh, thank heaven I'm old fashioned.
He'll have to stop soon, there will be no one left to expel.
I thought as you had called a meeting of the trustees, you would like to see what
"The Times" says about you.
I have already read it, thank you, Mr. Grimsby.
Very awkward, all these letters about your expulsions.
Quite a storm of protest.
Why, some of them might almost have been written by you, Mr. Grimsby.
On the contrary, I have received letters of protest myself.
So have I. McPhail's father,
Barrington left the country.
It appears I'm a heartless villain who delights in expelling boys, ruining their future and breaking their parents heart.
Perhaps you would care to read them.
But your methods are revolutionary, sir.
They are intended to be, Mr. Grimsby.
Yes, sir.
Some day, I'll throw that man downstairs.
Old Grimey is the least of it, Mary.
Mr. Brown, sir.
Good day to you, sir.
My respects to you, ma'am.
How do you do?
Are the other trustees with you?
They are not, sir.
They express their sentiment by staying away.
I'll go.
No, ma'am, I want you to hear what I have to say.
Will you call the meeting to order, Doctor.
Mr Brown, when I accepted this appointment it was on the condition that
I was to have a free hand.
I do not intend to offer my resignation.
You are, aware, I suppose, that public sentiment is against you?
It is not my habit to yield to public sentiment.
Do you him in that, ma'am?
I do.
In that case it's my duty to inform you, sir, that I'm with you with all my heart.
I respect your methods.
I admire your courage.
I'll back you to the end.
That's a very brave attitude, Mr. Brown.
Brave, sir?
No, stubborn.
We Brown's are stubborn and proud of it.
And just to show you how stubborn I am,
I'm going to send my own son to Rugby.
Good bye, Charity.
Good bye, Master Tom.
Bye Jacob.
I had sent your father off to school, from this very spot I did.
Was he very brave?
Ha, ha, bawled like a cow.
Dashed if I'm going to cry.
Ha, ha.
Ha.
This here pea shooter, made it for you me-self, I did.
Hit the master's nose at thirty paces, ha.
Thanks, Jacob.
Bye, Nanny.
For your cold feet, Master Tom.
Thanks, Nanny.
You may kiss me just once.
But no trimmings, mind.
Thanks for not saying be a good boy, wash behind your ears, and all that.
But you will, though, promise you won't forget.
SQUIRE BROWN: All right, Tom.
Come along.
Goodbye, everybody.
Goodbye!
Goodbye, Tom.
Come back here.
Judy come back here.
I suppose the women blubbered over you properly.
Ma... Maggie was an awful mess.
I don't see why... why people can't have more self-control.
Your quite right, my boy.
When we meet the
Rugby coach, would you mind very much if I don't kiss you when we say goodbye?
There might be some other boys.
I know just how you feel.
I said the same thing to my father when I went off.
No, we'll just shake hands like two old gentlemen.
Thank you, sir.
The Rugby coach will be here directly, sir.
Thank you.
Drink it up, Tom.
Nothing like starting off warm.
Excited?
Yes, sir.
Got the key of your trunk?
Yes, sir.
Here's a sovereign for you.
You may find it useful.
Oh, thank you, sir.
Well, I suppose there's no good giving you advice.
Boys, never take it.
I know I didn't.
But you stick to Dr. Arnold.
I don't understand half he says, but bless my soul if he isn't on the right scent.
I'll do my best, sir.
I know you will.
Tom!
Yes, sir?
I don't talk much about it, but you mean a lot to me.
[KNOCKING]
The Rugby coach is here, sir.
Here you are, Sam, the usual.
I'll rare tackle that on a cold morning.
[LAUGHING]
Goodbye, Father.
Goodbye, Tom, my boy.
[SOBBING]
Let them go, Nick.
Do you know Rugby by any chance?
Goodness, Lord bless ya, sir.
I go to it every day of me life.
What sort of place is it, please?
Slow place.
A very slow... only three coaches a day.
And one of them a two horse one, more like a hearse than a coach.
The life of the school, sir.
What?
Oh, that's to say I'm a new boy.
Oh, I thought as much.
A nice, quiet gentlemen like you.
Are the boys pretty wild?
Wild?
Oh, we gets us all kinds of rows along the road, what, with their arguing and their pea shooters and so forth.
I've got a pea shooter.
Yes, I see you have.
I dare say you will be as big of a varmint as the rest, ha.
[HORSE WHINNYING]
Come on, Nellie.
[LAUGHING]
Here we are, sir, Rugby.
Rugby!
I say, you, fellow.
Is your name, Brown?
Yes.
My father knows your father, and he asked me to take you in charge.
My name is East.
How do you do?
Is this your trunk?
Shabby, isn't it?
Take it up to my room.
- Right, sir.
- Uh, give him six pence.
Six pence?
Look out about it or no more jobs from me.
Thank you, sir.
Give him your coat.
We don't wear them here.
Oh, I'm sorry.
What's that on your head?
A cap.
Only louts wear caps here.
If any of my friends saw you with that helmet, you'd know not what would happen.
A new boy, needs a hat.
I see that, sir.
Try that one.
Too small.
SHOPKEEPER: How about that fit?
Too big.
Splendid.
How much?
Oh no.
Chalk it up, T Brown.
And, uh, burn this.
With pleasure, sir.
Now the first thing you've got to learn to do is to hang on to your tin.
Tin?
Money.
Oh.
I say, you haven't got any tin to spare, have you?
Well, my father gave me a sovereign.
Splendid, we'll have some murphies.
Murphies?
Potatoes, young'un, potatoes.
I say, you are green, aren't you?
SALLY: Not a murphy we have till
I see the color of your money.
No money, no murphies.
That's been my motto for 40 years, and I'm not going to change it now.
What do you want, Master East?
Murphies, Sally.
Murphies.
Your father still owes me for when he was here.
We have a sovereign, my good woman.
When I sees it I'll believe it.
Show here our money, young'un.
[WHISTLING]
Gold.
EAST: Don't swallow it.
Bring us some murphies.
Yes, sir.
- East?
- What is it, my boy.
Is this the new fellow?
Mm.
Nice looking, isn't he?
What about introducing us?
If you like.
Brown, these are a couple fourth form pests.
The tall one is Diggs and the short one is Tadpole.
How do you do?
Very hungry, thank you.
There you are, sir.
There's your change, sir.
Very hungry.
Haven't you got any tin?
We're broke.
Temporarily embarrassed.
Gave my last sovereign to a beggar.
Funny thing, my father owns half of Yorkshire and I can't afford a murphy.
Uh, that's a shame.
Isn't it?
East?
EAST: What is it, young'un?
Would it be all right if I got some more for your friends?
Would it be all right?
Wait.
Well, young fellow, that's not a thing we generally let a new boy do.
But, uh, seeing that your a friend of East... Sally, three pairs of murphies.
DIGGS: Six pairs of murphies.
TADPOLE: Nine pairs of murphies.
SALLY: Oh!
Old Grimey!
Please, sir, it wasn't...
GRIMSBY: You can explain that to the headmaster.
Great Teddy.
You may go up.
DR. ARNOLD: Come in.
Now what is this disgraceful affair?
Who are you, boy?
Brown, sir.
Brown?
I'm the new boy.
Oh, yes, of course.
Why didn't you report to me before getting into mischief.
I didn't know, sir.
Do you realize that you might have done somebody a serious injury with this?
That isn't mine, Sir.
I didn't shoot it.
Now, come now.
Don't begin by telling lies.
But I didn't, sir.
I tell you I didn't.
What happened?
Well, you see, sir.
There was a bird...
Well?
And someone aimed at the bird, and suddenly old Grimey just got in the way.
Old Grimey?
You mean, Mr. Grimsby?
Yes, sir.
Then... then everybody suddenly disappeared, and, well, there I was with...
With that in my hand.
I believe you, Brown, because you are your father's son.
And because a liar would have told a much more plausible story.
Oh, thank you, sir.
You wouldn't like to tell me who the someone is who aimed at the bird and brought down Mr. Grimsby?
No, sir.
I couldn't do that.
No, I thought not.
So you're the
Squire Brown's son?
Yes, sir.
This is an important day for you.
Yes, sir.
An important day for the school, too.
A new boy is always important.
He may be an influence for good or for evil.
Your father once did a very courageous thing, Brown.
I know that you won't fail him.
Now, run along.
See that the matron has the keys for your trunk.
Yes, sir.
Brown?
Yes, sir?
Remember, from now on I trust you.
Never hurt me by breaking that trust.
I promise, sir.
DR. ARNOLD: Very well.
[BREAKING GLASS]
The doctor let you off all right?
Yes, thank you.
Tadpole's pretty smart, isn't he?
Is he?
Of course, if Dr.
Arnold had known it was Tadpole who did it, he would have tanned his hide out.
Oh.
Brown, you didn't say it was
Tadpole who did it, did you?
Oh, no, of course not.
Well, that's all right.
Remember, my boy, never tell tales.
It isn't done.
East?
Yes, my boy.
The doctor is wonderful, isn't he?
Doctor, he's all right.
The fellas in the sixth form think he's one of the best.
I don't take him seriously.
Is this your study?
Yes, what's wrong with it?
Oh, nothing, it's...
It's wonderful.
I'm going to let you share it with me.
Uh, give me your key.
Oh, do you really mean it?
Yes, if you don't hang around me all the time.
Don't forget, I can't be seen with a new fellow much.
Oh, of course you can't.
I promise I won't bother you.
EAST: Mm, lot's of food, all right.
Uh, strawberry or raspberry?
Strawberry.
Looks good.
It's very decent of you to put up with me at all.
Well, that's all right, young'un.
I'm only doing it to please my father.
He'll be good for a five pound note when I tell him how decent I've been.
Fag!
All right, East, your lot.
[LAUGHING]
Why are you so late?
Oh, you're new, aren't you?
Yes, sir.
Well, it's not your fault.
But remember, when a six former shouts fag, you run as quickly as you can.
Yes, sir.
WALKER BROOKE: It's an old Rugby custom.
You lower schoolboys have to clean our boots, run our errands, and do anything else we need.
Here, East, clean these.
All right.
Is that one of the masters?
Masters?
Of course not.
That's old Brooke, head of our house.
How wonderful.
Do you think I might clean his boots some day?
Here, you can do them now if you want to.
Anything to make you happy there, old boy.
Oh, thank you.
Enjoying yourself, Flashman?
[LAUGHING]
Hello, who's this?
Uh, a new fellow.
What's his name?
Uh, Brown.
Very unusual name.
Most distinguished.
Welcome to Rugby, Mr. Brown.
[LAUGHING]
Anytime I can help you, just let me know.
You know, that's my food you're eating.
We're not complaining.
The cake is a bit starchy, but it will do.
And remember, when your family sends you more jam, tell them to make it black currant.
I don't like strawberry.
Oh, and by the way, can you sing?
Not very well.
Mm, that's splendid.
Come on, kid.
Whatever did he mean?
Oh, that.
Tonight's singing in hall and we get a double allowance of beer.
New boys have to sing a song on their own.
Oh.
EAST: If you stop they make you drink salt and water.
Ever drunk salt and water?
You'll hate it.
(SINGING) In Scarlet
Town, where I was born, there was a fair maid dwelling...
[CROWD SHOUTING]
Made every youth well rue the day, and her name was Barbara Allen.
Oh, in the merry month of May, when grief of fingers swelling, young Jimmy Brow on his deathbed lay for love of Barbara Allen.
He sent his man to the place where... to the town where...
He stopped.
TOM BROWN: To the town where she was dwelling, you must come to my...
Come on, drink it up.
But I didn't stop.
Yes, you did.
Drink it up.
WALKER BROOKE: Sit down, Flashman.
But he stopped.
I'll decide that.
Sit down!
Well done, young'un.
And now gentlemen of the schoolhouse,
"The Poacher of Lincolnshire."
(SINGING) When I was bound apprentice in famous Lincolnshire, for well I served my master for nigh on seven years.
Till I took up to poaching as you shall quickly hear.
Oh, 'tis my delight on shiny night in the season of the year.
As me and my companions were setting out a snare, 'twas then we spied the gamekeeper, for him we did not care, for we can wrestle and fight, my boys, and jump from anywhere.
Oh, 'tis my delight on a shiny night in the season of the year.
[CHEERING]
Well, you managed to upset Flashy, all right.
But I didn't do anything.
Flashy likes getting his own way.
Take my advice, young'un, and don't irritate the boys.
It doesn't pay.
Oh.
The night would have been simpler if you had drunk the salt water.
Where's Brown?
Ah, Mr. Brown, the great vocalist.
Ever been tossed in a blanket?
I don't think so.
Splendid, cure for obstinate boys.
Takes them down a peg or two.
Come on here we go, fellas.
Ashley, you take and end.
All right, Brown, in you go.
Keep your head down for anything they have.
That's better.
Around the other way more.
- Go and keep a look out.
- All right.
I've got a grip on it.
I say, Mr. Brown, are you coming?
Come on, here we go, fellas.
Grab the corners, fellas.
That's it.
Hurry up there.
Come on.
Think you're going to enjoy it, Mr. Brown?
Yes.
He thinks he's going to enjoy it.
[LAUGHING]
Now then, all together.
Once, twice, thrice.
GROUP: And away.
Still enjoying it, Mr. Brown?
Yes.
Once again.
I'll do it for him.
We're not interested in you.
All right, a real one this time.
Right.
GROUP: Away.
And away.
And away.
[LAUGHING]
FLASHMAN: Now then, all together.
Ceiling this time.
Ceiling you fellas.
One, twice, thrice.
GROUP: And away.
The Doctor!
Get up, and keep your mouth shut.
Don't take that.
Tom!
Come on.
I can't get up.
You'll walk on that leg, even if it's broken.
What are you doing out of your room?
I'm sorry, sir.
Well done, young'un.
You didn't do too badly.
Oh, thank you, East.
It's only just twisted.
It will be all right in a minute.
See how we do things here?
Never tell tales and never give anyone away.
Of course, I don't care for Flashy either, but telling tales just isn't done, even with him.
Well, goodnight, young'un.
Goodnight, East.
[KNOCKING]
Come in.
Good evening, Brooke.
May I come in?
Oh, I didn't know it was you, sir.
I just came to bed.
Yeah, so was I. Sit down.
I don't suppose you would care for a cup of tea?
I'd like some very much.
Splendid.
Schoolhouse match tomorrow, hm?
Yes, sir.
Are you going to beat the rest of the school?
We've beat them for the last six years.
Are you going to do it again?
I hope so, sir.
Thank you.
Brooke, tell me, do you suppose there's any bullying going on here?
Yes, sir, there is.
I can't put my finger on it, but
I'm sure it's starting again.
Well, I suppose it's only to be expected.
Last year the sixth form wasn't very... it wasn't very strong.
Now you're head of the house, Brooke.
Yes, sir.
And if I catch anybody at it...
You'll give them a good hiding and enjoy it, huh?
Yes, sir.
I'm afraid it goes deeper than that, Brooke.
You and I must build school opinion against bullying, so that no boy will stand by while another boy's tormented.
Who makes your tea?
Tadpole, sir.
Ah, that is Martin.
He makes the best tea in the house.
I wish Tadpole would come and give my wife a few lessons.
Bullying is a tradition in our school.
But we must build a new tradition.
And that's where I rely on you fellas of the sixth.
Your authority rules the school, and you're influence sets its tone.
It's you who make traditions.
And that's a great responsibility at 19, isn't it?
Yes, sir.
But we'll stand by you, sir.
Yes, I know you will.
Well, goodnight, Brooke.
Goodnight, sir.
Don't work too hard tonight or you won't be much use to your side tomorrow.
I won't.
You know, Brooke, when I have confidence in my sixth form there's no post in England that
I would exchange for this one.
Thank you, sir.
Goodnight, Brooke.
Goodnight, sir.
Your foot still hurt?
No, it's much better, thank you, East.
I say, you aren't going to be homesick or anything awful?
Oh, no, thank you, East.
Then what's the matter?
I say, Rugby's wonderful, isn't it?
[CHEERING]
ATHLETE: Look on his borders there.
Look out.
Come on.
I've got it!
[CHEERING]
Say, Get on him, quick!
Put it down.
[YELLING AND CHEERING]
Come on, let's go!
Now, run, sir.
Jump, sir!
[CHEERING]
Well, gentlemen, we beat 'em.
[CHEERING]
Had a lot of charges there that would have carried away our house, but we beat 'em!
Hurray!
And why did we beat them?
Your play.
Nonsense!
We beat them because we're proud of the school house.
And we mean to keep it the best house at Rugby.
Yay!
Now, I'm as proud of this house as any one, but it's still a long way from what I'd like to see it.
There's a deal of bullying going on here, and depend on it, there's nothing breaks up a house like bullying.
Bullies are cowards.
And one coward makes many.
Now, I know a lot of you say, standby the good old ways, down with the Doctor.
Well, let me give you a word of advice.
In the first place, they weren't the good old ways, they were the bad old ways.
And in the second, down with the Doctor is easier said than done.
You will find him pretty tight on his perch and an old British custom with a handle.
He doesn't meddle with anyone worth keeping, but look out for squalls if you go your own way and that way isn't the Doctor's.
And bullying isn't his way.
And it isn't my way.
And isn't the way of any decent fellow in the house.
So let's have an end to it.
Well, and now I've done blowing you up and I'll give you a toast.
We've drunk with three times three and all the honors.
The toast that binds us all together, and those who have been before here, and those will come after, to the dear old school house, the finest house and the finest school in England!
To the school house!
Oh, uh, hello, Flashman.
Oh, uh, hello, East.
Do these Latin verses for me.
If I must?
And just why didn't you come when I called?
Because you're not in the sixth form and you've got no right thank us.
Oh, I haven't, haven't I?
Oh.
TOM BROWN: You leave him alone.
[LAUGHING]
And why must I leave him alone, my little man?
Because it's bullying, that's what it is.
And Mr. Brown doesn't approve of bullying.
No, of course, I don't.
On second thought, you had better do the versus.
A bright boy like you!
And do them at once.
Must turn them in before third lesson.
I'm not going to do them.
Oh, don't be an idiot.
I'm not going to.
Why not?
Because old Brooke said we should put down bullying.
Oh, that's it.
And if we give in to them it just encourages them and Brooke said about the
Doctor and everything.
Well, if you want to get skinned alive, go ahead.
East?
Hm?
Do you mind if I don't do them?
Are you serious?
Yes, I am.
Then I've got a better idea.
Give me the verses.
If you must make a fool of yourself, at least do it properly.
[RECITING LATIN]
Flashman!
Yes, sir.
Please come here.
Yes, sir.
This is capital,
Flashman, capital.
Thank you, sir.
In some of these lines, I see a humility of character
I did not think you possessed.
Always try to be humble about my work, sir.
Excellent.
You're only one year behind the fifth.
This may alter your position.
Thank you, sir.
Uh, read the last two lines, please.
Uh, yes, sir
[RECITING LATIN]
Translate.
I'm feeling.
Ill, sir.
Really I am.
Nothing of the sort.
Translate.
Yes, sir.
[RECITING LATIN]
These little versus I did not compose them.
[LAUGHING]
Go on, Flashman, go on.
Do not let the vulgar products of the crowd distract you.
Yes, sir
[RECITING LATIN]
Give me, Master...
[RECITING LATIN]
Many lashes...
[RECITING LATIN]
I implore.
It will be a pleasure to give you the lashes you request.
Come and see me at 6:00.
I always feel stronger after tea.
You may laugh out loud, gentlemen.
[LAUGHING]
[WHISTLING]
Hello, Mr. Brown.
Hello.
You're a great wit aren't you? (SHOUTING) Aren't you?
No.
That's right, you're not.
And you're going to
Old Grimey to tell him it was just a rotten joke, aren't you?
No.
Do you know what we do to new fellows who get above themselves?
No.
Is there a fire at the wall?
You bet there is.
Now Mr. Brown, are you going to Old Grimey?
No.
Are you going to Old Grimey?
No, I'm not.
Grab him by the heels.
East!
East!
East!
East!
FLASHMAN: Shut up!
TOM BROWN: East!
FLASHMAN: You shut up.
Let me go.
Let me go.
EAST: Where's Brown?
It has nothing to do with you.
TOM BROWN: Let me go.
Let...
FLASHMAN: Now be quiet.
Let me go.
Let me go.
Let me go.
Now will you give in?
No I won't.
Hold him closer.
[SCREAMING]
I'm burning!
Agh!
Careful, Flashy, his clothes are smoking.
Hold him closer.
[SCREAMS]
It burns!
Let me go.
Why you, little...
[SCREAMS]
Now will you give... he's fainted.
Tom!
Tom!
Well, young'un, feel better now?
Yes, thank you, East.
Fine.
Next time, keep out of Flashy's way.
He's brave enough.
Just a bit green that's all.
I don't think he is so green.
Why not?
Well, he's made me feel small.
Look at us.
We've always been scared of the bullies and given in to them.
Now a new fellow comes and stands up to them on his own.
Yes, and look what it got him.
But he didn't give in, that's the point.
He didn't give in.
Listen, everyone, if Brown can stand up to the bullies, why can't we?
Because.
We can't.
But we've got too much sense.
Don't be a fool.
Why they would kick us to pieces.
Not if we stick together.
We're five to one.
Besides, it would be worth it, then we can put down bullying, just like old Brooke said.
We could put it down forever.
I wouldn't mind risking a kicks for that.
Nor would I.
GROUP: Nor would I.
It's a fight to the death, then.
Fighting is the only thing they understand and we've got to give it to them.
- I'm with you.
GROUP: So am I.
Any one else?
Put up your hands.
What about you?
Are you afraid?
Who said, I was afraid?
I'm with the fourth form!
Down with tyrants!
Hurray for the revolution.
[CHEERING]
[LAUGHING]
[LAUGHING]
Ow!
They're coming.
GROUP: Hee, haw.
Hee, haw.
Hee, haw.
Hee, haw.
Hee, haw.
So sorry, sir.
Oh, I beg your pardon.
Dash it, the rat.
[LAUGHING]
[LAUGHING]
Fag!
[LAUGHING]
[SIGH]
Ow!
Ow!
[LAUGHING]
Ah!
[LAUGHING]
Get out of here.
Well, gentlemen We've got them on the run and all we have to do is finish them off.
Easy.
But how are we going to do it?
Easy.
Don't keep saying, easy.
It is easy.
How?
Well, I'll tell you.
One of us has got to fight Flashy, single combat, regular rules.
That would stop him forever.
That's the right.
EAST: If we beat him it would break his heart.
Diggs, you're a genius.
Yes, but who is going to do the fighting.
Oh, you, of course.
Me!
But, why.
Me?
You're the biggest.
You're the only one who would have a chance against Flashy.
Oh, I think it's a rotten idea.
Nonsense, it's wonderful.
All you have to do is to insult him.
And then he challenges you, regular rules, and you knock him into little pieces.
Did I hear someone mention fisticuffs?
(WHISPERING) What do we do now?
(WHISPERING) Would it be better tomorrow?
(WHISPERING) No, go on.
Flashman?
Well, my young fellow?
Nothing.
Splendid.
Hello, Diggs.
[LAUGHING]
Why didn't you do it?
Thought I might kill him.
We'll never beat them now.
TOM BROWN: Mr. Flashman...
Look!
You're a coward, and a bully, and a toady and you smell.
[COMMOTION]
Why you little rat.
Come on.
Fair fight, Flashy, fair fight.
Regular rules, unless you're afraid.
Better do it, Flashy, and teach them a lesson.
All right, you've asked for it, you'll get it.
[COMMOTION]
Fight, Brown and Flashy.
Fight!
Come on, fellows.
Fight, Brown and Flashy.
Fight.
Fight!
DIGGS: Now come on you fellas, make a ring.
Here Ashley, you're timekeeper.
Oh, right.
Come on, Brown.
Kill him.
Don't take too long about it.
I won't.
Time!
Good luck, Brown.
You'll need it.
[FIGHT COMMOTION]
Get him, Flashy.
Three to one, Brown.
Three to one, Brown.
Three to one...
Seven to two, Brown.
Seven to two, Brown.
Come on, get the center of him, kill him.
I'm with you Brown.
Come on, old Brown,
Come on, I'm with you.
Come on, old Brown.
That's it, come on, Brown.
ASHLEY: No.
It's six to four, Flashman.
Come on.
Come on.
[GASPS]
Come on, get up.
Get up!
[YELLING]
Oh.
Oh, they're waving.
Hit, him, Flashy, hit him.
Time!
[CHEERING]
Splendid round.
That's it, keep it up.
Brown the bomb.
You're taking a long time.
It's your one chance, make it easy, and let him come to you.
Finish him off, Flashman, he's making a fool out of you.
Time!
Steady, gentleman.
Go on, come on.
[FIGHT COMMOTION]
I'll murder him.
I'll murder him.
Let me at him.
I'll murder him.
Let me at him.
Let me at him.
Let him have it.
Come on, Brown.
And take...
Give it to him.
GROUP: Oh!
Two.
Two.
Three.
Don't go so fast.
Five.
Three.
Six.
[CROWD YELLING]
One.
Two.
Three.
Two.
Five.
Three.
Six.
Boo!
Belt him, come on.
Give him one for the roasting.
Flashman.
So Flashman did it.
The Doctor!
[GASPS]
Brooke.
I'm surprised to see you here.
The sixth form is expected to stop all fights.
Yes, sir.
These boys must be punished.
Yes, sir.
Congratulations, Brooke, the new tradition's coming along nicely.
[CHEERING]
Tom, you were wonderful.
I didn't think so when you first came, but I've changed my mind now.
[CHEERING]
Look you, fellas, Diagones!
Splendid, we'll put it up.
Puts some hats on them.
All right.
[CHEERING]
Eternal friendship.
Eternal friendship.
WALKER BROOKE: Brown, the Doctor wants to see you in his study.
DR. ARNOLD: Have either of you anything to say?
Yes, sir.
I'm very sorry this happened, but I didn't start it, sir.
Are you trying to tell me that Brown did.
I'm only trying to be fair.
Did you give Brown any provocation?
Oh, no, sir.
No tormenting or bullying.
No, sir.
Are you quite certain, Flashman?
Absolutely.
Very well, wait outside.
Thank you, sir.
Brown, I'm not going to ask you why you were fighting.
I'm satisfied that you would not fight for a cause in which you are ashamed.
But rules must be observed.
Yes, sir.
You knew the rules against fighting.
Are you ready to take your punishment.
Yes, sir.
Very well.
How many did he give you?
Six of the best, but it was worth it.
Go on you're next.
Flashman, we have both failed.
I have failed to influence your character.
You have failed to understand that God does not give a man strength to persecute the weak.
He who does so is a bully.
A bully, sir.
I'm not a bully.
I've never persecuted any one.
That's enough, Flashman!
You make the mistake of thinking I do not know what goes on in this school.
No, sir, I don't, sir.
You tormented one of your school fellows who was weaker than yourself.
Now I'm not punishing you for that, Flashman.
There have been bullies in every school, in every community, in every nation.
But sooner or later humble men will rise and throw them down.
But I am punishing you because you lied to me.
I'm sorry, sir.
I didn't mean...
You lied, Flashman.
And lying is a poison that will corrupt any country.
You are a bully, a coward, and a liar.
There's no longer any place for you at Rugby.
You're not expelling me, sir.
Oh, no, sir.
I'll do anything, but don't expel me, sir.
Don't expel me.
My father, It will break his heart.
I'll kill myself.
I swear I will.
I couldn't stand it.
Don't expel me, sir.
I'll do anything, but please don't expel me.
I didn't mean it, honestly I didn't.
I won't be a bully anymore, I won't.
You've got to let me stay.
You must!
You must!
Please, let me stay, please!
I can't believe it.
Nobody ever tells a tale.
Something is wrong.
It just isn't done.
Who else could have.
Two minutes after he talked to Dr. Arnold I'm sacked.
I can't go home.
I can't face my father.
He'll disown me.
He'll disown me.
The most enormous spread you ever cooked.
Murphies, sausages, tea and everything.
Shall we have a celebration?
Of course, Auntie.
All the fourth form is coming.
SALLY: But who's going to pay?
I am.
Uh, Effie, I'll heat the oven, bring on the murphies.
Master Brown, you and your friends can eat till ya bust!
You've got a great champion, haven't you?
Yeah!
Shut up!
He couldn't beat
Flashy in a fair fight, but he got his revenge all right.
[COMMOTION]
Keep quiet, you fellows, quiet.
What are you getting at?
What would you think about a fellow who told tales?
You know what we'd think.
But that's got nothing to do with Brown.
Oh, yes it has.
Brown couldn't beat Flashy, so he got even with him by telling the Doctor about the roasting.
That's not true.
Whatever you say.
All I know is that your dear little.
Brown saw the Doctor first.
And when Flashy went in the Doctor knew all about the roasting.
I say you, fellas, Flashy's been expelled for the roasting, not for the fight.
Now perhaps you'll believe me.
SALLY: Here you are, Master Brown.
Fit for a king, if
I says it myself.
Sally, you are marvellous.
And you, Effie.
Oh, thank you.
Thomas, run and tell them it's all ready.
Yes, sir.
And don't tell them about the sausages.
They're a surprise.
Great day for you, Master Brown.
It's wonderful, isn't it?
Wonderful.
I can't believe he'd do a thing like that.
But he did and that's all there is to it.
Facts are facts.
Come on, East, you can't stick with him now.
Flashy got what he deserved, but he never told tales on anyone.
Well, let him stick with him if he wants to.
They're cold, Sally, you'll have to put them in the oven again.
Well, I can't keep putting them in and taking them out.
Oh, of course, you can't.
Effie, cut off and tell them to hurry up.
Yes, Master Brown.
Where are the others?
They aren't coming.
But why not?
Because you wouldn't listen to good advise.
I tried to help you, young'un, but you went your own way and now your in for it.
East, whatever has happened?
Remember I warned you that we don't tell tales?
Yes.
Well, now do you know why they aren't coming?
No.
You saw the Doctor before Flashman.
TOM BROWN: Yes.
And when you came out he knew all about the roasting.
It isn't true.
Flashman's sacked, that proves it.
The others don't think I told.
What else can they think?
They can't think that, they can't.
You don't think that, you don't, do you, East?
You don't!
This isn't much use to me any longer.
Oh, what a waste of good murphies.
I don't believe...
Aw, come on, cheer up, Master Brown.
Eat 'em yourself.
We'll help you.
Won't we, Effie?
EFFIE: Of course, Sally.
It's a funny, It's the first time I ever tasted one of me own murphies.
Sally?
Yes, Master Brown?
It's not that I don't like you or nothing,
I just don't feel like it.
Effie, there's a peck of cruel things in this world but there is...
[KNOCKING]
Go away.
What you up to?
Nothing.
Will you put this letter on the coach?
Thomas Brown Esquire.
Yes, Master Brown.
They wrecked his room, ma'am.
And he seems uncommon miserable about it.
He wouldn't try to run away?
Looks that way to me.
I've seen it happen before, ma'am.
Thank you, Thomas.
Brown, have you seen
Dr. Arnold anywhere?
I know all about that, Tom.
Let's clear it up, shall we?
Yes, ma'am.
Poor Tom.
But this sort of thing has happened before, you know.
There was a boy before you came, who was ragged like this.
He ran away.
That wasn't very brave of him, was it?
No, ma'am.
It would hurt Dr.
Arnold terribly.
Mrs. Arnold?
Yes, Tom.
Is it... is it being a coward if you give in when everyone is against you?
Dr. Arnold had everyone against him, but he didn't give in.
And then your father did a very brave thing.
And that helped him.
I expect the Browns have always been pretty brave, haven't they?
Yes, ma'am.
Tom, dear.
Dr. Arnold and your father are very proud of you, you know.
And if you ever did anything cowardly, well, like that other boy did, it would hurt them terribly, wouldn't it?
I expect it would.
Dr. Arnold would think that he failed your father.
Mrs. Arnold, he mustn't feel like that.
I couldn't let him feel like that.
No, of course you couldn't.
Everything's all right now, isn't it?
Yes, ma'am.
[SNIFFING]
Mrs. Arnold?
Yes, Tom?
You knew I was going to runaway, didn't you?
Yes, I knew.
You don't mean to tell Dr. Arnold?
No, dear, it'll be just between us.
Thank you, ma'am.
I gave your letter to Sally, she'll put it on the coach.
My letter?
My letter!
Has my letter gone?
Master, Brown.
Has my letter gone?
Of course, I put it on the coach not five minutes ago.
Oh, Jiminy.
But didn't you want it to go?
Oh, of course, I did but I don't now.
Why not?
Well, it was to my father and there was something awful in it about the Doctor, because I was planning to do something, but I've changed my mind and
I must get that letter back!
How?
Oh, go after the coach, of course.
But how?
Oh, I don't know.
Oh, yes I do.
But that's my aunty's cart.
I'm going to borrow it.
Master Brown.
It's a matter of life and death.
Oh, I couldn't stand by and see you take it.
But if I was to turn my back.
Thanks, Effie.
Two people saw a Rugby boy drive my cart like mad, and my poor mare what will probably never recover her wind.
Is that all?
Yes, Sir.
Very well.
Any damage will be paid in full, of course, Mrs. Harowell.
Thank you, Sir.
DR. ARNOLD: That is if it was one of our boys who stole your cart.
Thomas, see if any boy is missing from the dormitories.
Yes.
You're going to search...
Thomas, uh, take Mrs.
Harowell with you.
[TAP]
He's locked out.
Very sad.
I suppose we had better get him.
How?
Or for that matter, why?
It's too risky.
If it were one of us it would be different.
Young gentleman!
You're telling me, after stealing my cart and my horse.
[ARGUING]
If I had my way, the villain would have his head cut off in the tower of London.
THOMAS: Don't keep your pot boiling over.
I'll soon find out whether it was one of my young gentlemen or not.
Well, where on earth have you. Been?
There was a letter and
I had to get it back, so I took Sally's cart.
Sally's cart?
She doesn't know it's me, but she's been to the Doctor and she's furious.
So, I saved your hide.
It was jolly decent of you, after everything.
After what?
After all the awful things you thought about me.
Well, don't think
I've changed my mind.
I'm not interested in you or anything about you.
I never want to see you again.
And if ever tell the others I was fool enough to help you,
I'll bash your head in.
Martin.
Harris.
Reed.
Bradley.
Douglas.
Brown.
East.
East?
He thinks it was me.
I know he does.
Well, don't be to calm about it.
He'll tell the Doctor and I'll get the blame.
Then all you've got to do is go to the Doctor and tell him it was me.
But I can't do that.
You know I can't.
I'm afraid you've got to because I'm not going to own up.
We'll make you.
Oh, no you won't.
You'll have to tell tale.
Then they'll all turn against you as they have against me.
And then you'll know what that feels like.
You little swine.
It'll do you good.
But, East, please remember the facts.
Last night you were out of your dormitory.
Yes, sir.
DR. ARNOLD: Last night a cart was stolen.
Yes, sir.
Last night a Rugby boy was seen driving that cart.
Yes, sir.
Were you that boy?
No, sir.
You stole the cart, didn't you?
Yes.
Then go to the Doctor and tell him you did.
Let East tell him.
You know he won't.
None of us tell tales here, except you.
Are you going to the Doctor?
No, I'm not.
You refuse to give me an explanation.
Yes, sir.
You realize that without an explanation
I am compelled to believe that you are lying.
Yes, sir.
You know the punishment for lying?
Yes, sir.
Very well.
You have courage, East.
And few liars have courage.
TOM BROWN: Oh, oh, No!
It's no good.
Better leave him alone.
TOM BROWN: No!
[CRYING]
[BELL RINGING]
He didn't tell.
Taking a cart.
That's something that boys will do, and a thrashing would be enough.
But a boy who let's his friend be blamed for what he himself has done, he's a mean, despicable coward.
But East didn't do that.
No, Mary, it's worth than that.
I've seen Sally and that girl of hers.
There is no possible doubt that the boy I must expel is Tom Brown.
[COMMOTION]
[DOOR CLOSES]
So you thought you could make him tell?
Now you know how we do things here.
[CRYING]
If only he'd had the courage to own up.
Mary, I have prayed that he might come to me.
It's not too late.
He may still come.
Not now, Mary, not now.
[KNOCKING]
Come in.
All ready, sir.
Oh, very well, Thomas.
Of all my boys,
Squire Brown's son!
He was to be the symbol of my success.
Now he's the symbol of my failure.
Not your failure, one boy's failure.
My failure, Mary.
He came to Rugby with every promise.
Rugby has made him a coward.
If I've failed with him, what of the others?
I cannot reach any of them.
It's no use, Mary.
I can't go.
I've deceived myself.
I shall apologize to
East and expel Brown, then I must resign.
Please, sir, it was me.
Please, sir, it was me.
I stole the cart.
I thank you, Tom.
It's a record.
And serves him jolly-well right.
You don't like Brown, do you?
No, I don't.
I hear you think he told about Flashy?
Everyone knows he did.
Well, you young fellas jump to conclusions.
As a matter of fact, it was you who told.
I did?
At the fight.
Give him one for the roasting.
I heard you, and so did the Doctor.
Well, Master Brown, did he hurt you very much?
Yes, he did.
Funny thing was, he was so cheerful about everything.
Brown, we seemed to have made a mistake.
I'm awful sorry.
So am I.
EAST: Well, I'm not.
You maybe all right, but
I very much doubt it.
This is a big school,
Brown, and the less we see of each other for the next four years, the better.
Sorry, young'un.
But I'd probably feel the same if you made me go through all that torture.
Nearly getting expelled is no joke you know.
But he'll get over it in time.
I wonder.
[WHISTLING]
Fag!
Oh, here, you're new aren't you?
Yes, sir.
Well, remember, when the sixth formers shout fag you come as quickly as you can, another Rugby custom.
Yes, sir.
Here, clean these.
Very well.
Gentlemen of the school house.
When I first came here, my father told me to stick by the Doctor.
And let me tell you he had a powerful lot of enemies and it wasn't everyone who understood him.
But I haven't got to tell you to stick by the Doctor.
[CHEERING]
You're all with him.
The whole school's with him.
And there isn't anyone who doesn't know that he's the finest headmaster in England.
[CHEERING]
And when you get to know him, the finest friend.
He's strong and he's wise and he's true.
And when I leave
Rugby tomorrow there's one person I'll always remember.
Yes, and if I'm not mistaken, the world will remember,
Arnold of Rugby.
[CHEERING]
Oh, hello, sir.
Oh, hello, Tom.
Won't you sit down?
Not in your chair.
I'll sit over here.
I hope you're feeling better, sir.
A little tired, Tom.
End of term.
Did you finish your packing for tomorrow?
Not quite, sir.
DR. ARNOLD: Sad at leaving, eh?
Of course, sir.
Oh, we all feel sadness in the last night.
But you have to look forward,
Tom, Oxford next term.
You'll find Bradley at Oxford.
Remember Bradley?
And Fenton.
Ha, ha.
The number of thrashings
I gave that boy.
Here is Douglas.
He's in the Army now, in India.
And Brooke.
He was your hero, wasn't he Tom?
Yes, sir.
He would be very proud of you.
And Harris, poor old Harris.
He's doing quite well now.
And Petrie, he's in the Foreign Office.
He'll make a fine statesman.
So many boys.
And now you're going out into the world.
God bless you, Tom.
Oh, by the way, we just had an attack of spring cleaning and this turned up.
I think I can trust you with it now.
Goodnight, Tom.
Goodnight, Sir.
Master Ashley, coach money to
Lincoln, one pound ten, sir.
Here you are, sir.
Master Tanner, coach money to London, one pound five.
Is it true, Dr. Arnold's ill.
Don't you count on it, sir.
He'll be back here next year beating you as hard as ever.
Goodbye, Jesse, good holiday to you.
Goodbye, sir.
[KNOCKING]
Come in.
The last coach will be leaving directly, sir.
Yes, Thomas.
THOMAS: Will you be saying, goodbye, to the young gentlemen?
Of course.
Give me my cap and gown.
No, dear, please.
You're not well enough.
I've only been saying goodbye to the boys, Mary, since I came to Rugby.
I do wish you wouldn't go.
The boys are happy.
I don't want them to know that I'm ill.
There's the Doctor.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, sir.
Goodbye, Alexander.
Remember me to your father.
Goodbye, sir.
Well, that's the last of Rugby.
Oh, no it ain't.
You owe me six and six.
You owe me halfpence.
Goodbye, Ashley.
I hope you have a nice holiday.
Goodbye, sir.
Goodbye, East.
I'm sorry you're leaving us.
So am I, sir.
We didn't agree at first, but now we understand each other perfectly.
Yes, sir.
Going to Cambridge?
Yes, sir.
And Brown's going to Oxford?
Yes, sir.
Still distant from Brown?
Don't you think it would be a good idea if you two fellows shook hands before you left Rugby?
Goodbye, sir.
Goodbye.
Go on, me beauties.
Goodbye!
Goodbye, boys.
Don't forget old Sally.
Goodbye, boys.
Goodbye, Sally!
[LAUGHING]
Another year, sir?
Another year.
It's a funny thing, sir.
Boys come and boys go, but we goes on forever.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
Ichabod and Mr Toad
Ichabod
Ichabod and Mr Toad
Ichabod, Ichabod and Mr Toad...
If you chose the most fabulous character in English literature,
who would it be?
Robin Hood? King Arthur?
Becky Sharp?
Sherlock Holmes?
Oliver Twist, perhaps?
Any one of them would be an excellent choice.
But as the most fabulous character of all, I nominate
a toad.
J Thaddeus Toad, Esquire.
Have you never met him?
You'll find his story in
"The Wind in the Willows".
Toad was the one disturbing element.
Incurable adventurer, mad, reckless, tried everything.
A positive mania for fads, and he never counted the cost.
He had a host of fair-weather friends.
But there were only three who had his best interests at heart.
One was a badger. MacBadger.
And then there was a water rat.
A bit stuffy, perhaps, but really a fine fellow. And a mole.
A gentle creature, kind and sympathetic.
They all made their homes in a quaint community along a riverbank.
On that particular day, Mole was in a hurry because...
 because he was late for tea.
A regrettable habit, but Rat had learned to put up with it.
Sorry, says Mole. Quite alright, says Rat. Two lumps?
Then, just as they were getting settled...
- Special Delivery, Mr Rat.
- Thank you, Postman.
How's everything on the river, sir?
Dashed quiet, as usual, thank you.
Mole, listen.
"Dear Rat: You and Mole must come to Toad Hall at once."
"Urgent!! A MacBadger."
Rat was certain Toad was making trouble again.
The answer to that lay just around the bend at Toad Hall,
the ancestral home of
J Thaddeus himself.
This impressive structure was the finest home on the river.
The animals were tremendously proud of it.
They felt it gave the whole community an air of respectability.
To lose Toad Hall was, of course, unthinkable,
and yet it was no secret that Toad's follies
had brought him to the brink of bankruptcy.
So, MacBadger had volunteered to put Toad's house in order.
Smashed fence. Two guineas.
Damage, lamp post. Four pound six.
Destruction of hen house...
How can a man figure with all this hubbub?
- I'll not be put off!
- Pay my bill!
- I want my money!
- Silence!
You'll get your money in due course.
Now, go along with you.
I'll pay no more today.
Why did I assume the responsibility of looking after...
Didn't I tell you...?
It's you, Rat. And Mole, too.
Thank goodness, lads.
You've come at last.
Poor MacBadger. He'd reached the end of his rope.
As he said himself...
I'm practically a nervous wreck.
I say! What seems to be the trouble?
Summat's got to be done about Toad!
This time he's gone too far!
But he promised us...
Promises? What good are promises when wild manias take him?
Now, look, you're his closest friends, are you not?
- Yes.
- Very dear friends.
Then you must find
Toad and stop him!
- What's he doing?
- He's got a new mania.
He's rampaging about the county in a canary-yellow gypsy cart.
With a horse named Cyril.
Tally-ho!
Are we on our way to Nottingham, to Brittingham, to Buckingham
Or any hammy hamlet by the sea? No!
Are we on our way to Devonshire, to Lancashire or Worcestershire?
I'm not so sure
We'll have to wait and see
Are we on our way to Dover?
Or going merrily over
The jolly old road that goes to Plymouth Ho?
No! We're merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
On our way to nowhere in particular
We're merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily on our way
Though the roads are perpendicular
- We're always in a hurry
- We have no time to stall
We've gotta be there
We've gotta be there
But where, we can't recall
We're merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily on our way
And we may be going to Devonshire, to Lancashire, to Worcestershire
We're not so sure, but what do we care?
We're only sure we've got to be there
We're merrily on our way to nowhere at all
Hello, you fellows!
You're the very animals
I was coming to see!
Come along! Hop up!
We'll go for a jolly ride!
The open road, the dusty highway. Come!
I'll show you the world.
Travel, change, excitement...
How stupid of me! I want you fellows to meet my noble steed Cyril.
Aye, that's me.
A bit of a trotter, a bit of a rotter.
How do you do, how do you do, how do you do?
How do you do?
Say, guv'nor, your friends seem a bit on the stuffy side.
Toad, we want to have a talk with you.
A visit! Splendid!
This is serious. You must give up that horse and cart.
Give up my... But my dear
Ratty, this is my career!
- You can't mean...
- I do!
- You must stop this foolishness!
- No.
- You must!
- No. I won't do it.
Your reckless behaviour is giving animals a bad name!
You're becoming a menace to society.
At least think of poor MacBadger!
And as for that horse, no good will come of gadding about with such a fast and irresponsible beast!
- Get him, Mole!
- Come down, Toady.
Stop it! Let me go!
Giddy up, Cyril! Giddy up!
It's no use. You'll never get me to give this up!
Tally-ho! Yikes!
Look!
Gad! What is it?
- Lummy, guv'nor, it's a motorcar.
- Motorcar?
A motorcar... Gad! What have I been missing?
- Ratty, it isn't... He hasn't...
- It is, and he has.
A new mania. Motor mania.
Mania.
That's it. That's what it was.
A positive mania.
No telling where it would end.
Might linger for months.
And with Toad Hall at stake,
Rat and Mole had no choice.
Only one thing to do.
Lock the poor chap up until the poison worked out of his system.
Hold him, Moley!
- That's better.
- And you can't escape.
Simply no use trying.
Let me out! Open up, I say! Please!
Open the door!
Playing jailer to one's dearest friend wasn't pleasant.
In fact, Moley immediately wanted to call it quits, but Ratty said no.
This time they must be firm.
It wasn't just a matter of saving Toad from himself.
There was MacBadger to consider, and
Toad Hall and all it stood for.
There was only one thing wrong with Ratty's cure for motor mania.
It didn't work. You see,
Toad was far too clever.
And, at the moment, completely mad.
He was determined to get a motorcar,
even if he had to beg, borrow or...
Toad arrested! Extra!
His Majesty versus J
Thaddeus Toad, Toad Hall,
Riverbank, Doodle-Bunton-
Maxon-Morton, Surrey.
24th day of August, set forth in the following brief.
Accused is J Thaddeus Toad, of stealing a motorcar, and with it, endangering sundry subjects of His Majesty,
- their life and limbs.
- Counsel for the Crown, proceed with the case.
My lord, I call, as first Crown witnesses,
Mr Rat and Mr Mole!
Is it true that you had the accused locked in his own house because he had threatened to get a motorcar?
Did you, or did you not, have him locked up?
- We did.
- Thank you! That is all!
- Next witness.
- Mr Angus MacBadger!
As trustee of the Toad estate, you knew of the prisoner's mania for motorcars?
And due to his extravagance, you cut off his allowance?
Then he was, to the best of your knowledge, without funds?
That is all! Thank you!
Gentlemen of the jury, the Crown rests.
Counsel for the defence will present his case.
My lord, with the court's indulgence,
I rise prepared to plead my own defence.
Stop it.
Gentlemen of the jury...
I call, as my first witness, Cyril Proudbottom.
Are you acquainted with the defendant, J Thaddeus Toad?
Lord love a duck, yes! He's one of the jolliest chaps I've run across.
And simply tons of money.
Good fellow? Throws it away.
But he wasn't throwing it away that day!
You heard Mr MacBadger testify that his allowance was cut off.
Then how did he get a motorcar?
The only way a gentleman gets anything.
- The honest way.
- And what is the honest way?
I thought you wouldn't know!
Your Lordship, I...
The witness may testify in his own words.
Righto, guv'nor.
I'll just give you the facts.
When Toady escaped from his boudoir he headed straight for my place.
Soon we was off down the highway,
but we hadn't gone far, I confess, when, with a rush and a roar...
 something passed like the London Express.
It was big, it was red, it was beautiful.
A motorcar, a bit of alright.
Toady was transfixed with... rapture.
You could tell it was love at first sight.
The motor pulled up to a tavern, wherein was located a bar.
And we watched while some tough-looking weasels
got out of that lovely red car.
Now, weasels, I know, are deceitful.
And not to be trusted, at all.
But how could I know they'd stolen that car?
I didn't have no crystal ball.
The guv'nor is not one to dally.
He made up his mind like a flash. He says...
Try it for size, my good Cyril,
while I see what they'll take for it, cash.
Into the tavern he saunters, where the barman was back of the bar.
And he said,
Cheerio, tavern keeper. Who's the owner of that... hot-looking car?
The barman, a codger named Winky, leaned over the bar and said,
- Why?
- The guv'nor answered,
That car must be mine!
Whatever the price is, I'll buy.
But Toad found he hadn't no money.
So, he promptly offered a trade.
The weasels appeared to be willing.
In a moment, the bargain was made.
Toady drawed up a paper, with almost incredible speed.
He called on old Winky the barman
to... pop over and witness the deed.
Now, the guv'nor is not a bit stingy.
He never does anything small.
The weasels gave him the red motorcar, and he gave the weasels Toad Hall.
Traded Toad Hall? An estate worth £100,000 for a motorcar?
You expect me to believe that?
I don't expect you to believe anything.
Fortunately, I can produce a witness. Call Mr Winky!
My lord, gentlemen, facing you in the witness box is a citizen of substance and standing.
A man of unimpeachable honesty.
Now, Mr Winky, do you recall an incident that took place in your... establishment last August 12th, that I was a party to?
Yes, sir, that I do.
Well, then... just tell the court what actually happened.
Well, guv'nor, you tried to sell me a stolen motorcar.
That's a deliberate lie, you monkey-faced rum pot!
I've been framed! Let me go! Help!
Toad guilty!
Toad's disgrace rocked the nation.
The court was determined to make an example of him.
Toad's friends tried to help him, but were always blocked.
They must've reopened the case a dozen times.
Appeals to this court, that court any court. But the decision stood.
The case of J Thaddeus
Toad was closed.
Merry, merry Christmas time
Bind every heart with happiness
Let everyone...
Yes, once again, it was a white Christmas.
Melodies of Yuletide hung sweet upon the winter's air.
Hearts were gay and spirits high.
Indeed, in all the city,
only one spot was untouched by the warmth of Christmas cheer.
The Tower, grim monument to
despair. Cold, cruel, forbidding,
and the abode of Toad for a good many Christmases to come.
Poor Toad. Alone with memories of his wasted life.
What a fool he'd been!
With many a pang he recalled the kindly face of Angus MacBadger,
and his sage advice, so often scorned.
A tear for Moley, too, for his loyalty, sympathy, understanding.
Toad wept for Rat, and all those little lectures so often laughed at.
Yes, within the dark confines of his miserable cell,
a new Toad was born. A reformed
Toad, a repentant Toad.
In a flood of remorse, he vowed to forsake the follies
of the Primrose path.
Never again would he give way to those mad, foolish manias
that had brought him to this sorry end.
As it's Christmas, you're allowed a visitor.
- Your grandma's here.
- Grandma?
Merry Christmas, sonny!
Granny wouldn't forget her little Toady boy!
Look, Christmas gift.
- What is it?
- Don't you get it?
A disguise.
All you've got to do is put on this natty little costume and...
Alas for good intentions.
Toad was incurable.
One whispered word and all his high resolve
vanished in the mad whirl of this new adventure.
This new mania! Escape!
Toad's escaped!
Halt!
Good evening, ma'am.
Good evening to you, Officer.
We're merrily, merrily, merrily...
Begging your pardon, but you...
You fellows, do you see him?
Gad, what perfectly ripping luck!
Trap Toad, would they?
Never!
- There he goes!
- Where?
Over there!
Blockheads! Let them scour the countryside.
Once more, J Thaddeus
Toad had the last laugh.
That Christmas Eve, along the riverbank,
the name of Toad was banned from conversation,
lest the memory of his disgrace becloud the merriment of the season.
Yet there was one home, at least, in which two loyal hearts
still held the warmth of Christian charity.
Bless this good food we are about to enjoy.
Bless us, every one.
And... bless poor Toad.
And may he get time off for good behaviour.
Why, it's a poor old lady.
Let's take her over by the fire.
What are you doing here?
I was just sort of...
Well, this is a merry Christmas!
But... aren't you afraid of the police?
Afraid of the police?
I, Toad, afraid of the police?
- Open up, I say!
- The police!
Hide me, Ratty!
Sorry, but you owe a debt to society.
And you've got to pay.
Mole, let them in.
But, Ratty, don't you think, maybe...
Open the door!
Hi, lads!
I've just made a very important discovery.
Toad Hall is ablaze with lights
and in possession of a pack of weasels.
And the leader of the gang is none other than Mr...
Winky!
Hip, hip...
Hooray!
And so, you see, he did trade Toad Hall for the motorcar!
- Toad was innocent all the time.
- Aye, lads.
And if he were only here right now...
- Toad!
- Angus!
Sorry, Toad, I misjudged you.
I hope, someday, you'll find it in your heart...
Not another word.
To err is human, to forgive...
Not so fast!
You're still guilty in the eyes of the law.
To prove your innocence, we've got to get that paper away from Winky!
Now, I have a plan.
We'll sneak in through the secret tunnel.
It was an expert plan, cunningly contrived but extremely dangerous.
It would work only if each did his part. There was no margin for error.
The odds against them were tremendous, but the stakes were high.
But now, steady's the word...
One false move and four lives hang in the balance.
Careful, lads. There is a guard.
- I'll pop him off!
- Don't shoot!
Who goes there?
That was a close one.
Trust Toad to start things off on the wrong foot.
No turning back now. Nothing for it but to push on.
What new and greater perils lay ahead, no one could say.
Toad had already got out of hand, so anything could happen.
Look. They're all asleep.
Lads, they're drunk.
They've been hitting the bottle.
But where is Winky?
There he is!
He's got the paper on him!
We'll have to climb up on the balcony.
The paper! It's gone!
Get him, you blokes!
I beg your pardon!
Over here!
After it!
- Just one more!
- There he is! Get him!
Where's Moley?
Well, laddies, we saved our skins, but we didn't get the deed.
Well done!
Hip, hip, hooray!
So, it was a happy ending, after all.
Toad's friends were dreadfully proud of him. And why not?
He was a new Toad, completely reformed,
through with gypsy carts and motorcars for ever.
And so, on this happiest of New
Years, a toast was in order.
- To the New Year and...
- To the new Toad!
Hello, you fellows!
Come! I'll show you the world.
Travel, change, excitement...
That was the fabulous
Thaddeus Toad.
But let's weigh our judgement carefully,
we Moles and Rats and Badgers.
Don't we envy him a bit?
I know I do.
When we speak of fabulous characters,
the most fabulous will always be, to me,
the master of Toad Hall.
Yes! J Thad was quite a lad!
Speaking of fabulous characters,
England has produced a bumper crop.
But here in the colonies, we have a few of our own.
Paul Bunyan, Pecos Bill,
Johnny Appleseed, Black Bart,
Davy Crockett, Daniel Boone.
And, of course, the one and only Ichabod Crane.
Ichy was the country schoolmaster dreamed up by Washington Irving.
He had a way with a yarn did Mr Irving.
If we could journey back to that period in history
when Manhattan was but a market town,
we would discover, in one of the coves
which indent the shores of the Hudson,
the little village of Tarry Town.
And just beyond, nestled deep in the low rolling hills,
a sequestered glen.
It's a quiet, peaceful place,
and yet, somehow... foreboding.
It abounds in haunted spots,
twilight tales and local superstitions.
The best-known story concerns an itinerant schoolmaster
who once frequented these parts.
Some say his melancholy spirit still haunts the vicinity.
The pedagogue was described as a most unusual man.
To see him striding along,
one might mistake him for a scarecrow eloped from a cornfield.
He was tall, but exceedingly lank.
His head was small and flat on top, with a long, snipe nose.
It looked like a weathercock perched upon his spindle neck.
Altogether, he was an apparition seldom to be seen in broad daylight.
Late one drowsy autumn afternoon,
this strange figure first approached Sleepy Hollow.
As usual, there had gathered
at Ye Olde Schnooker and Schnapps Shoppe
a group of rustic lads, the Sleepy Hollow boys.
Their self-appointed leader, Brom Bones,
was a burly, roistering blade, always ready for a fight or a frolic.
Though Brom was given to madcap pranks and practical jokes,
there was no malice in his mischief.
With his waggish humour and prodigious strength,
Brom Bones was quite the hero, all the country round.
Odds bodkins! Gadzooks!
Look at that old spook of spooks.
Who's that coming down the street?
Are they shovels or are they feet?
Lean and lanky
Skin and bone
With clothes a scarecrow would hate to own
Yet, he has a certain air
Debonair and devil-may-care
It's the new schoolmaster
What's his name?
Ichabod
Ichabod Crane
What a name!
Kind of odd
But nice just the same
Funny pan, funny frame
Ichabod may be quaint
May be odd, and maybe he ain't
Anyway, there's no complaint
From Ichabod, Ichabod Crane...
Though the arrival of the pedagogue gave rise to mixed emotions,
the townspeople all agreed they'd never seen anyone...
Like Ichabod, Ichabod Crane
The schoolroom became
Ichabod's empire,
over which, with lordly dignity, he held absolute sway.
Truth to say, Ichabod was a conscientious man,
and ever bore in mind the maxim spare the rod and spoil the child.
Still, he was careful to administer justice
with discrimination.
For it behoved him to keep on good terms with his pupils.
Especially if their mothers happened to be good cooks.
Who's the town's ladies' man?
Gets around like nobody can
Has to be none other than...
As time went by, it may be seen that the pedagogue
got on tolerably enough.
Moreover, Ichabod found ways to increase his slender income
and, at the same time,
awaken the cultural interests of the sleepy little village.
It was inevitable that a man like Ichabod
would become an object of ridicule to Brom Bones and his gang.
Yet, to Ichabod, these were small matters.
He possessed a remarkable equanimity
which remained quite undisturbed until
that fateful day, when his path was crossed by a woman.
A certain woman.
Katrina Van Tassel, only child of Baltus Van Tassel,
the richest farmer in the county.
She was a blooming lass, plump as a partridge.
Ripe, melting and rosy-cheeked.
Once you have met that little coquette Katrina
You won't forget Katrina
But nobody yet has ever upset Katrina
That cute coquette Katrina
You can do more with
Margaret or Helena
Or Anne or Angelina
But Katrina will kiss and run
To her, a romance is fun
With always another one to start
And yet when you've met that little coquette Katrina
You've lost your heart
There was no doubt the fair Katrina
was the richest prize in the countryside.
The schoolmaster, being an ambitious man,
began to fill his mind with many sugared thoughts
and hopeful suppositions.
Katrina, my love.
Who can resist your grace?
Your charm?
And who can resist your father's farm?
Boy, what a set-up!
There's gold in them acres, and that ain't hay.
Not to mention that lovely green stuff.
Katrina, my sweet. My treasure.
Treasure...
That barn's a gold mine.
How I'd love to hit the jackpot.
Dear Katrina. Papa's only child.
Papa!
The old goat can't take it with him.
When he cuts out, that's where I cut in.
Sweet Katrina, poor little rich girl.
But don't worry, Katie,
Ichabod will protect you.
Yes, Katrina, you've won me.
I surrender.
And yet when you've met that little coquette Katrina
You've lost your heart
Every portal to Katrina's heart was jealously guarded
by a host of rustic admirers.
But Ichabod was confident he'd soon ride roughshod
over these simple country bumpkins.
But the most formidable obstacle he had failed to reckon with.
That was the redoubtable
Brom Bones.
The ease with which Brom cleared the field of rivals
both piqued and provoked the fair Katrina.
She often wished that some champion would appear
and take the field openly against the boisterous Brom.
A wiser man would have shrunk from the competition,
but love is blind.
Ichabod was aware only that Dame Fortune
was at last thundering at his door.
It's true that Brom liked a joke as well as the next,
but enough was too much.
It was time for open warfare.
He'd double that schoolmaster up
and lay him on a shelf in his schoolhouse!
But this was easier said than done.
No doubt of it, this was
Ichabod's lucky day.
The schoolmaster was a man of hidden talents,
a rival to be reckoned with.
Still, wars are neither won nor lost at the first encounter.
The high-flyer might yet be brought to earth.
For Brom Bones was never a man to cry quits.
On the occasion of her father's annual Halloween frolic,
Katrina chose to stir the embers of the smouldering rivalry.
One invitation in particular carried a most personal summons.
The worthy schoolmaster was in a transport of joy.
To him, this could mean but one thing.
Ichy, you sly old dog, you!
What is this strange power you have over women?
Well, tonight's the night, boy!
Just turn on the old charm.
The fair Katrina is yours for the asking.
Gaily bedecked and nobly mounted on a horse he had borrowed,
Ichabod issued forth like a knight errant of old
to keep a tryst with his lady fair.
There was nothing to equal the merrymaking
at Mynheer Van Tassel's farm.
To Ichabod, here was a perfect field for his endeavours.
How would he put his best foot forward!
Beyond all his other talents, he prided himself upon his dancing.
Unhappy Brom, already bested at every turn,
saw himself once more outmatched.
For as he watched the posturing pedagogue,
he had to admit that here was a flawless picture
of ease and grace.
There was no doubt that Ichabod was the man of the hour.
Brom had to concede his rival another victory.
Yet, there was still a chance his time would come.
For when the hour grew late, Van
Tassel would call on his guests
to tell him ghostly tales of Halloween.
Brom knew there was no more potent believer
in spooks and goblins than Ichabod Crane.
Just gather round and I'll elucidate what goes on outside, when it gets late.
Around about midnight, the ghosts and banshees get together for nightly jamborees.
Things with horns and saucer eyes, and some with fangs about this size!
- Some are fat.
- And some are thin!
And some don't even wear their skin!
I'm telling you, brother, it's a frightful sight what goes on, Halloween night.
When spooks have a midnight jamboree
They break it up with fiendish glee
Ghosts are bad, but the one that's cursed
Is the Headless Horseman, he's the worst
That's right, he's a fright on Halloween night
When he goes a-joggin' across the land
Holdin' his noggin in his hand
Demons take one look and groan
And hit the road for parts unknown
Beware, take care, he rides alone
And there's no spook like a spook who's spurned
They don't like him and he's really burned
He swears to the longest day he's dead
He'll show them that he can get ahead
They say he's tired of his flamin' top
He's got a yen to make a swap
So he rides one night each year
To find a head in the hollow here
Now, he likes them little, he likes them big
Part in the middle, or a wig
Black or white, or even red
The Headless Horseman needs a head
With a hip-hip and a clippity-clop
He's out lookin' for a top to chop
So don't stop to figure out a plan
You can't reason with a headless man
Now, if you doubt this tale is so,
I met that spook just a year ago.
Now, I didn't stop for a second look, but made for the bridge that spans the brook.
For once you cross that bridge, my friends
The ghost is through, his power ends
So, when you're riding home tonight
Make for the bridge with all your might
He'll be down in the hollow there
He needs your head
Look out! Beware!
With a hip-hip and a clippity-clop
He's out lookin' for a head to swap
So don't try to figure out a plan
You can't reason with a headless man
It was the witching hour of night as Ichabod pursued his travel home.
The sky grew darker.
One by one, the stars winked out their lights.
Driving clouds obscured the moon from sight.
Never had the schoolmaster felt so melancholy,
so utterly alone.
The nearer he approached the hollow,
the more dismal he became.
Once inside the murky glen, Ichabod's anxiety increased one-hundredfold.
The forest seemed to close in behind him.
Every small detail of
Brom's awful story
returned to haunt his recollection.
Headless Horseman.
Beware!
Once you cross that bridge, my friends,
the ghost is through, his power ends.
Next morning, Ichabod's hat was found.
And close beside it, a shattered pumpkin.
But there was no trace of the schoolmaster.
Shortly thereafter, Brom Bones led the fair Katrina to the altar.
Rumours persisted that
Ichabod was still alive,
married to a wealthy widow in a distant county.
But the good Dutch settlers refused to believe such nonsense.
They knew the schoolmaster had been spirited away
by the Headless Horseman.
With a hip-hip and a clippity-clop
He's out looking for a head to swap
But don't try to figure out a plan
You can't reason with a headless man
Man, I'm getting out of here!
Lassie Come Home is the story of a dog,
but it's also the story of a people
as strong and enduring in peace as they are in war,
the people of Yorkshire.
The county of Eric Knight's birth and boyhood.
This man is a Yorkshireman.
Sam Carraclough, and his dog, Lassie.
Lassie is Sam's only saleable possession
in the dark prewar days of unemployment, empty pockets
and the dole.
- Hello, Sam. You here, too?
- Hello, Tom. Ron.
- Hello, Sam.
- Hello, Lassie. Good day to you, my girl.
She looks champion, Sam.
Tell the truth, Tom.
Have you ever seen anything better?
No. I was only talking to my missis the other night, Sam.
That's just what I said to her.
I said, "If ever there was a better dog in all Yorkshire than Sam's Lassie,
"then she must've died before ever I was born."
That's what I said.
She's in pretty fair shape, she is, but I do believe her coat could be a wee bit shinier.
You know, Sam, they do say that cod-liver oil is good to make a dog's coat shiny.
Some of these fancy breeders give it to their dogs pretty regular.
If we could afford cod-liver oil for our dogs, perhaps we could get ourselves a little bit of beef once in a while.
It's Joe she's thinking of, at school.
- Has she ever been late, Sam?
- Never.
There seems to be something inside her telling her when it's time.
Go along, then.
Joe Carraclough.
Apply yourself to your lessons, lad.
Joe, lad! Must you always come in like thunder off the moors?
Sorry, Mother.
Lassie and me, we want some bread and jam. Don't we now, Lassie?
Bread you can have, but jam you'll do without.
If there's no jam, honey will do.
Honey, is it?
There's some nice beef dripping I have and that's what you'll get.
- Thanks, Mother.
- Here you are, lad. Now run along.
- Have a good time with Lassie today.
- I will, Mother.
But why especially today, Mother?
Did I say today especially, lad?
I didn't mean to. Now run along.
Hello, Father.
- Did thou see the Duke today, Sam?
- Aye. He'll be by tomorrow.
Here you are.
Hello, Lassie.
All right, girl.
Downstairs. Come on, downstairs.
All right, I'll get up.
Why, Father!
Look, Father. Look what I've taught Lassie.
You seem worried, Father.
Is it about your work?
No, lad. It's not that.
But whatever trouble comes, remember, we've got to be men together.
- Do you see?
- Aye, Father.
Make haste, now.
You'll be late for school. Come.
Thank you, Lassie.
What's the matter, Lassie?
Don't you want me to go?
I'll be out at 4:00, as usual.
Bide well, Lassie.
She's a beauty, Carraclough.
She's just come back from seeing my lad to school, sir.
Fifteen guineas.
Wasn't that the price you said?
Yes, sir.
I got the best of it, Carraclough.
I am an honest man, so I got to tell you I got the best of it.
- Are you quite sure you want to sell her?
- No, Your Grace.
- I have to.
- It's a fair price.
Put a collar on her and lead her from the back of the cart.
- Yes, sir.
- Get a move on.
Good day, Mrs. Carraclough.
Good day, Carraclough.
All right, Rogers.
Happen we should be telling Joe?
He'll be finding this out for himself.
Mother!
Mother, something's happened to Lassie.
She didn't meet me at school today.
What is it? What's wrong?
You may as well know it right off.
Lassie won't be waiting for you at school anymore.
Why not? What's happened?
Because she's sold, that's why not.
Sold?
Why did you sell her?
Lassie. Why did you sell her?
She's sold and gone and done with it.
Let's say no more about it.
- But, Mother...
- No more. Sit down and have your tea.
Sam, come and eat.
Now look what you've done.
Got thy father all angry.
I suppose you're happy now.
Come on, Joe. Eat up.
I don't want any.
Dogs.
If you ask me, I'm glad Lassie's gone.
That I am.
More trouble to take care of than a child.
Now it's done, I'm glad.
I'm glad, that I am.
Come here, Joe.
Look, Joe, you're getting to be a big lad now, and you can understand.
Lassie cost a lot of money to feed, and we've got to have food on the table.
We've got to pay the rent, and we just couldn't afford it.
And that's all.
These are poor times, Joe.
You mustn't upset your father.
He's worried enough as it is, and...
That's all.
She's gone.
Couldn't we buy her back someday?
No, Joe.
Lassie was a very valuable dog, much too much for us.
But we'll get another dog someday.
Just wait.
Times might pick up and we'll get another tyke.
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
I don't want any. I only want Lassie.
Priscilla, I'm going down to the kennels.
Hynes.
Don't know what the world's coming to.
Servants no good.
- Country's going to pot.
- Nonsense.
- What's that?
- I said, nonsense.
I thought that's what you said.
Fine state the world's in when the only person with courage enough to answer me back is my own granddaughter.
That's 'cause you're like me, my dear.
Look, I'm glad you turned up.
I want to show you my new dog.
Finest collie I ever set eyes on.
- I've been after her for three years.
- Three years?
Three years. Last year,
I offered the fellow 15 guineas for her.
Told him it was my rock-bottom limit.
He didn't seem to think so.
Held out for another six months.
Then the other day, he told me he'd take it.
Was she worth waiting for all that time?
Worth it?
You never saw another one as good.
Look at her.
She's beautiful.
Collie.
She doesn't seem well, Grandfather.
Nonsense. Nothing wrong with the dog.
Nothing at all.
Hynes! Where on earth is that idiot hiding?
- Hynes!
- Coming, Your Grace.
Yes, sir, you called me?
Hynes, what's the matter with that dog?
She looks a bit off-color.
Sir, they spoil them in them there cottages.
Treat them with a silver spoon, as you might say.
But I'll see she gets over it.
She'll take her food kennel-way in a while.
You keep an eye on that dog, Hynes.
- Yes, sir, I will.
- You'd better.
If you don't, I'll tan your hide, my lad.
That's what I'll do.
- Yes, Your Grace.
- Come along, child.
I'll see you eat before I'm through with you.
I'll see you eat, if I have to shove it down your throat.
Lassie, you've come back.
Mother, I've got a surprise for you.
Lassie's come home.
I was coming out of school and there she was, waiting for me right where she always is.
- I could see she was lonely for all of us...
- No.
But, Mother, she's come home.
- We could hide her. We could say...
- No!
Now get her out of here.
Before you know it, we'll have that Hynes around here, that know-it-all Hynes.
Father, you might at least say something to her.
It isn't her fault that she's happy to be home. Just pat her.
You know, happen they don't know how to care for her right up at the kennels.
I wonder if they understand how to feed her properly.
The men in this village think more of their tykes than they do of their own flesh and blood.
But truly, Mother, she does look thin.
I do believe they're not feeding her right.
I wouldn't put it past that Mr. Know-it-all Hynes to steal the best part of the dog meat for himself.
By gum, she does look a bit poorly.
I better get her a little something.
She could do with it, or I don't know dogs.
But the minute she's fed, back she goes.
That's no way to do it, lad.
If you're going to do a job, learn to do it right.
Sit, girl. Here, now.
Now, Sam, that's enough brushing.
Let her eat her food, and take her back to where she belongs.
You wouldn't have me take her back looking like a mucky Monday wash.
Look, Sam, if you don't hurry her back soon...
It's that man Hynes.
I thought so.
I thought as how I'd find her here.
I was cleaning her up a bit, then I were off to bring her back.
Yes, I'll bet you was.
It so happens I'll take her back myself, seeing as how I happened to drop in, as you might say.
I wasn't born yesterday.
I know all about you Yorkshiremen and your come-home dogs, training them to run back home, so you can sell them to someone else.
It won't work with me,
'cause I know a trick or two myself, I do...
Well, good evening.
I won't have him walking in here and keeping his hat on as if he's the very Duke himself.
And all on account of a dog.
She's gone.
And if you ask me, good riddance!
Now happen we can have a little peace.
I hope I never see her again. I do that!
You won't get out now, milady.
Not if I know anything.
Come on. Where is she?
- So that's why he's not home.
- Aye.
They're together, him and Lassie.
She's got away again.
He's run away with her so that we can't take her back.
Come now, lass, don't thee worry.
The lad will not have gone far.
I think I know where he'll be.
I'll be off to find her.
Come on, now, where's that there dog of mine?
Take thy hat off.
Don't you start no trouble.
You better not start no trouble now.
Get along home with you. The dog will be there as soon as I can find her.
It's all right, Lassie.
We can live out here on the moors, and they'll never find us.
We can live in the caves.
Happen I can run errands for the butcher, and he'll give me scraps of meat for you, and perhaps even a bone.
And then we'd never have to go home.
The Duke will never find you.
And we can always be together.
Come on, lad.
- For me?
- Yes.
Thank you, dear.
Who are those people, Grandfather?
- What are you doing with my dog?
- It's Lassie, sir.
I'm not blind, my good man, but what are you doing with her?
She's run away again, and I'm bringing her back.
What, again? Has she run away before?
I'm bringing her back again, sir.
- Hynes!
- Coming, Your Grace.
Has this dog ever run away before?
- Sir, it's this way...
- Did she or didn't she?
In a way, sir, she did.
She dug her way out.
I didn't want to disturb you about her, and I'll see she don't get away again.
Yes, you'd better. You're an idiot, Hynes.
I'm beginning to think you're an utter nincompoop. Pen her up.
If she gets out again, you can get out, too.
- Thank you for bringing her back.
- Yes, sir.
I'll pen her up.
And if she ever tries to get away... Here.
I brought my lad with me today to pen her up.
It's him she runs home to see.
He'll pen her up and bid her stay.
I'm sorry I didn't notice
I was stepping on thy foot.
- The kennels are over here.
- Come along, Joe lad.
Come on, now. Get in with you.
Come along, Lassie, get inside here.
Come on.
Come along now, lad.
Get it over with. Bid her stay, and tell her she can't be coming home no more.
Stay here and bide happy, Lassie.
Don't come home no more.
Don't run away no more, because thou doesn't belong to us anymore.
We're not allowed to see thee ever.
You've got a nice place here, so don't plague us by come running home.
Stay here and leave us be.
Don't ever come home again.
- Please, Joe.
- What do you want?
I hope you won't worry too much about Lassie.
I'll take care of her. Really, I will.
I'll take care of her for you.
So you won't have to worry any at all.
There's nothing much you can do with these fine kennels and a special man and all to take care of her.
But there must be something I can do, isn't there, now?
When her coat gets a little dull, you might try straining her water through some linseed.
- That picks her up a bit.
- I will.
Is there anything else?
Come along, Joe lad. Come.
It isn't good for her to be in that cage all the time.
Lassie likes a good walk, Lassie does.
She needs the exercise.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Poor Lassie.
Poor Lassie.
Poor girl.
You're not angry with me, are you, Father?
No, Joe. A father can't get truly angry at his own lad. Never.
It's just that he wants you to understand how things are.
And you mustn't think we're too hard on thee.
We don't want to be.
It's just that...
Back of it all, Joe, a chap's got to be honest.
Never thee forget it all thy entire life.
And there's a funny thing about honesty.
There's no two ways about it.
There's only one way about it.
Honest is honest. Do you see?
It's about Lassie you're talking.
Joe, when you've sold a chap something, and you've taken his brass, and you've spent it, then done is done.
Lassie was sold, and that's all.
- But we always fed her before.
- Before, I was working.
You can't feed a dog on the dole, and you can't feed a family on it, either.
- No, Joe, Lassie's better off.
- Maybe she'll get away.
No, lad, nay.
The Duke's taking her off to Scotland.
- Scotland?
- Aye.
Her and half a dozen other likely show dogs.
As soon as the shows are over, she's to go back to Scotland, and she's never to come to Yorkshire anymore.
Keep your head up. Keep it up, I say.
Good morning, Your Grace, Miss Priscilla.
- So how is she, Hynes?
- Looking better, Your Grace.
It must be this here Scottish air.
It seems to agree with her.
Her coat could be shinier.
Looks a little dull to me.
If you try straining her water through some linseed, it would make her look better.
Linseed, Miss Priscilla?
My dear, how did you know about that?
I just happen to know, that's all.
Somebody told me once.
It's an old Yorkshireman's trick, and a very good one.
- You better try it, Hynes.
- Yes, sir.
Come along, child.
Can't keep the horses waiting all day.
Linseed.
Keep your head up. Keep it up, will you?
- Grandfather!
- All right, coming.
A fella can't even take a ride in peace.
Now what's the matter, child?
Lassie. She's chained, Grandfather.
She needs exercise, and she can't get it that way.
- Hynes!
- Coming, Your Grace.
Hynes, what's that dog doing on a chain?
Sir, I had to do it.
Every afternoon she tears and scratches at her pen and might do herself an injury.
You told me to be sure not to let her escape again.
I never said put her on a chain.
No dog of mine goes on a chain, understand that!
- That dog needs exercise.
- But, sir, if I let her...
Put her on a leash and walk with her yourself, lazy idiot.
- I want that dog in perfect condition.
- Yes, Your Grace.
Never mind about, "Yes, Your Grace."
Do as you're told.
Come along, child.
So you have to have a walk, do you, milady?
I'll walk you. I'll more than walk you.
Come on. I suppose you'd like to have me late for my tea.
Hurry up, will you?
You're always hanging behind.
Come on, will you?
Here, what's the matter?
Down! Do as I tell you, can't you?
I'll break your blasted neck if you don't behave yourself. Go on!
Here, Lassie!
Nice girl, nice dog.
Don't you move. Now stay there.
Stay there, Lassie. Nice girl.
Stay there, now. Don't you move.
Come on, Lassie. That's a nice dog.
Come on. Here.
Lassie, come here!
Come here.
Here, Lassie, come here.
If I ever get my hands on you, milady, you'll never get away again, I'll tell you.
Exercise. That's what I get for walking you.
Close the gate, Miss Priscilla!
Don't let her get out! Close it!
Close the gate!
You've let her go.
That's what she's done, she's let her go.
She's going toward south, Grandfather.
- She's going toward Yorkshire.
- By Jove, child, I believe you're right.
- Over there.
- Aye. There.
Let him have it, lad. Fly, lad, let fly.
I cannot do it. It does not look like one of they devils to me.
It's a stray. You've got a right to shoot.
Let's see whether it gangs near the sheep first.
If it does, I'll shoot it.
There, it's seen us.
Let him have it.
- I hit it.
- You didn't. Look at it go.
Go on, Satan, get him. Sic him.
You cannot try shooting now, Jock.
You might hit my Satan.
Unless I'm mistaken, Andrew, there goes your Satan now.
Now, Jock. Now shoot.
Losh, man, why did you no shoot?
She but a brave dog, and she be going somewhere.
And besides, I could not shoot for I forgot to load up again.
Forget?
I should think a soldier would never forget to load up again after he's fired.
Well, laddie, we have so many things to remember.
It's wonderful, the things they have nowadays.
There were no pencils when I were a lad.
We had only slates.
Morning, Father. Morning, Mother.
- Many happy returns, Joe.
- Thank you, Mother.
Bless thee, lad.
- We've got a surprise for thee, lad.
- You can have three guesses.
Lassie!
It isn't Lassie, Joe.
It's just this.
Mother, it's champion. Thank you.
Thank you, Father.
It's champion.
Dan, don't you hear something?
Down by the chickens.
The door of the chicken coop is a bit loose.
If I weren't so lazy,
I'd have fixed it long since.
There again. There is something.
If you won't go and see who's after your chickens, Dan'l Fadden, I will.
Now, sit ye down.
If you want me to go, I'll go.
I'll look around, or you won't be sleeping tonight.
Dally!
All right, Dan. I'm coming.
- It's a dog.
- What?
A dog.
You poor, poor thing.
Now, who left you out on a night like this?
Dan, I think we have to carry him.
That's the last of the milk, Dally.
Won't be any for your tea tomorrow morning.
It won't matter, Dan.
I often think we do things just from habit.
In America, they say that they always drink their tea without milk.
Happen that's because they haven't learned any better.
Do you know, Dally,
I do believe she swam the river.
Swam the river?
Whatever makes you think that?
I saw her draggly trail all through the mud.
- It came from the river.
- Did you swim the river, girl?
Did you swim all that way to get from Scotland into England?
Dan, she doesn't seem to be swallowing.
- What?
- Do you think she's dying?
I don't know, Dally.
Best thing we can do is just to let her be.
I think I'll sit up with her tonight.
- Now, Dally, you've done your best.
- But she might need some help.
She's such a bonny dog, Dan.
Such a bonny dog.
Well, Dan?
Dally, I've asked all around the place.
Everywhere.
Nobody seems to have lost her.
Then she's ours.
You're ours, girl.
We've given them their chance, Dan.
Now she's ours.
Now, Dally, they might pass by chance and see her.
- So, don't...
- She's ours now, Dan.
I'm keeping her in the house or locking her in the back garden.
- I'm not letting anyone see her.
- How about the owner?
If it hadn't been for us, she'd have been dead now.
We are her owners.
What's the matter, girl?
Now, girl, you don't want to go out again.
Come back here and lie down.
Better put the kettle on.
What's wrong with you, girl?
You've been out for a nice walk with me on a string.
Surely you can lie down now.
Dally, I think you're daft.
I tell you, she's not happy here.
Nonsense. Every time she winks an eyebrow, you'll think she's got the measles, or the plague, or I don't know what.
- There, now, she's all right.
- But every afternoon it's the same.
She's not happy here.
Dan, do you know what I think?
What?
I think she's sorry for us, so she just puts up with us.
Like she's too polite to run unless we tell her to go.
Now, Dally, no dog can be full of things like that, like human things.
My Herself can. You don't know her, Dan.
You see, Dan, I know about this dog.
- I know something.
- What?
She's going somewhere.
She's on her way.
Now, woman. What fancies are you building up in your mind?
No, I don't care. I know.
Me and Herself, we both know.
She just stopped here like at a hospital or a wayside inn.
But now she wants to be on her way.
Only, she's too polite and understanding.
She doesn't want to hurt us.
All right, Dally.
If at 4:00 she makes up her mind to go, then, all right.
I believe it was a flea.
There are no fleas on Herself,
I'd have you know.
I do believe it's time.
All right then, dog.
If you must go, away with ye.
Goodbye, Herself.
Goodbye.
Good luck.
I'll put a lamp in the window, Dally, for tonight, like perchance she's just going for a long run.
Toots.
Come on, then.
Thank you, girl. Thank you.
There. In many ways, Toots, you're better than a wife.
You're neat, you're clean, and when you're around, a man gets no backchat.
We best be going.
What's the matter, Toots?
Come on, girl.
So you've smelled food?
There's plenty for all of us, isn't there, Toots?
Here, come on.
Come on, then.
You're frightened.
I won't hurt you.
I'll leave food here for you.
You can eat it up at your leisure. Aye.
She's a well-trained dog, isn't she, Toots?
She'll not make friends with strangers, nor take food from them, either.
Still, perhaps we can make friends with her, Toots.
What do you say?
What's that old proverb?
"A friend in need is a friend indeed."
We'll see.
She'll be friendly-like when she smells this. Won't she, Toots?
You bet she will.
Giddap, Stogie.
Whoa, Stogie.
Milady don't want to go this way, Toots.
Sitting there like a graven image, she is.
Looks like she wants to take t'other road.
And what would you do if a friend of yours wanted to take t'other road?
Aye, that's right.
I can just as well go round Godsey as by Manning.
Here's your dinner. Eat it up.
Didn't I say we knew a thing or two about tykes, Toots?
Throw meat on the road and it's no go.
She's a lady, Toots, and only be eating out of bowls.
Not like you and me.
I'm afraid we'll have to mend our table manners, Toots.
Here's a few more words you can mark down, Toots.
Before the end of the week, she'll be helping us in our act.
Come on, then.
Up.
Coming along, girl? Come on.
Bowls and pots, I've got lots.
Bring out your penny or you won't get any.
Come on, ladies, don't be bashful. Step up.
You all know me.
Rowlie Palmer. I come here every year.
Feel that.
- How much?
- Couple of bob to you, and cheap at that.
- How much is it?
- A bob. Tea for two for a bob.
Here! Stepped on by elephants!
Yes, kicked by hippopotami!
It's that strong, you couldn't break it with an ax.
When does Toots do her tricks,
Mr. Palmer?
Why, immediately, my little love.
Make way there, will you?
Give the dog a bit of room.
Let the dog see the rabbit, immediately.
Toots will come out, and Toots will surprise you.
That's right. There.
One, two, three, four.
All right, Toots.
All right, Toots. You can begin now.
Why, what's the matter?
You're waiting for someone.
Her Majesty hasn't arrived for command performance, is that it?
Why, here she comes now.
Now, Toots, go and pick up blue ring.
Come on.
There.
Now then, not many little dogs could go through this hoop but you could, couldn't you, Toots?
Come on.
Now, Toots, how about a nice ride on the ball?
But doesn't the collie do anything?
Why, you wouldn't expect royalty to perform, would you?
Would you like to do some work, girl?
Would you like to pick up these things?
Pick up these things!
May it please Your Majesty, as a favor to me, will you please pick up the things?
You see? Always remember to say
"please" and you get more in this world.
Thank you, ladies. Goodbye, one and all.
Show's over. I'll be back again next year.
Rowlie, it was grand.
I loved it even more than me pot.
- Doing all right, ain't he?
- Not half, he ain't.
Don't forget, money back if not satisfied, thou knows.
There's a good dog.
I think she'll be an addition to our act, don't you, Toots?
Here, come on.
That's a girl.
There, you've been good dogs.
Go and play. You did a good show today.
Excuse me, milady. I forgot.
Pardon me, Your Majesty.
Here.
She's a fine dog, Toots, but she'll never be as smart as thee, my sweetheart.
Mucky weather ahead, if I know it.
Smells like winter to me, Toots.
There's the smell of snow.
We'll be getting home soon.
There'll be a warm, fire-lit hearth waiting us, and roasting chestnuts, and a good bone for you, and maybe a nip or two of something invigorating for me.
Hold your dogs.
It's all right. We ain't doing nothing.
Quiet, both of you. Get back.
That's good of you, mate.
What you having, tea?
Aye.
Ain't that nice? Could you just spare two homeless chaps what's looking for work a couple of swallows to warm them up?
Aye.
No, you don't.
Come on, now. Where is it? If you're nice and hand it over without trouble, we won't hurt you. Will we, Snickers?
Of course not, Buckles.
- We won't so much as touch him.
- That's right.
But if you're looking for trouble, we'll let you have it. Where is it?
If you'll just give me time,
I'll hand it right over to you.
Go on, before I give you another one.
You blooming little rat!
You dirty swine.
Come back, girl.
You were a good one.
Weren't you?
You were a good one.
Will you come up and sit beside me,
Your Majesty?
Will you keep me company going home?
Come here, Your Majesty.
You won't come, then?
Perhaps it's best at that.
I'd like to go on with you, but stock's low, and I must be getting back home for winter.
Besides, you'd never really fit in with me like Toots did.
And you'd always be reminding me of her.
Not that you haven't been a good dog.
You understand a lot, don't you?
Forgive me.
At first I thought you were a coward.
But it's not that, nay.
There's summat else about thee, my lass.
And I'd dearly love to be inside thy mind and know what it is.
That's the pity of it.
You can understand some of man's language but man isn't bright enough to understand thine.
And yet it's us that's supposed to be the most intelligent.
You know, sometimes I think you didn't come along with me as much as you let me come along with you, as long as our roads lay together.
And now, you'll be off about whatever business it is you're on.
I'll be lonely.
No thee, and no Toots.
But then, I always did say,
"If a man doesn't like to be alone,
"he shouldn't never pick the job of traveling peddler."
That's goodbye.
May luck go with thee.
Off you go.
On you go, then.
And good luck.
There's a likely looking collie.
Aye, and it's got no license on it.
- No luck, Sam?
- No luck.
And a hole in my right shoe, for my pains.
I must have walked 20 miles today.
"No work," they say,
"and hundreds out of work, like you."
Do you know what Joe says?
He says Lassie took our luck.
He does say that when Lassie were home, things were better.
There's no luck about it.
When a man wants work and can't get it, it's summat more than luck.
I know. There's no sense to it.
I was just saying what Joe said.
He's a good lad, Sam.
He is. A good lad.
She's come all the way from Scotland.
Poor dog.
She must have traveled hundreds of miles.
- You better get her a little milk.
- There isn't any milk, Sam.
There's just a little bit of stew for supper.
Is it too good for her?
No, of course not.
I kept it for her, Sam. I don't know why.
Poor thing. She hasn't eaten for so long, she can't.
We've got to scrape up enough somewhere for a little milk.
Come along.
- Shan't be long, Rogers.
- Yes, Your Grace.
Sam, it's the Duke. He must have heard.
- He'll not have her.
- What shall we do?
Hurry, Sam.
Right in there.
If she wants our lad and our home as bad as this, then here she should stay.
- Good day, Mrs. Carraclough.
- Good day, Your Grace.
- Won't you come in?
- Thank you. Come along, Priscilla.
- Good day to you, Carraclough.
- Good day, sir.
All right, my dear child.
Mrs. Carraclough, this is my granddaughter, Priscilla.
- How do you do?
- How do you do, child?
- And this is Mr. Carraclough.
- How do you do, miss?
- Carraclough, about my dog...
- Dog, sir?
Yes, Lassie. She got away.
That's too bad, sir. Isn't it, Helen?
- It is a pity indeed.
- Aye.
I thought there was a chance, very slight, that you...
We haven't set eyes on her, sir. No, sir.
We'll be lucky if we ever get another dog like her.
Yes, sir, indeed we will.
She was a fine dog.
Yes, of course.
By the way, Carraclough, are you working?
- Working, sir?
- Yes, a job. Do you understand?
- Now, it's like this...
- Not exactly, sir.
There are three or four things he's considering but he hasn't quite said yes or no to any of them yet.
Really? He better say no and say it quickly.
I need a fellow up at my kennels.
I think, Carraclough, that you're the very fellow for the job.
I, sir?
I, to get paid for working with dogs?
- Will you take the job?
- You see, I...
Of course he will, sir.
He will? Good, splendid, excellent.
We'll make the judges at Crufts sit up, won't we, Carraclough?
Aye. Indeed we will, sir.
What was that?
What was what, sir?
Just a minute.
No, you're wrong, sir.
If you're thinking it's Lassie, you're entirely wrong.
How could a poor dog come all the way from Scotland?
- Just a minute, Carraclough.
- Yes, sir.
You can see that's a poor tyke we picked up on the road.
You can see that's not the dog.
She has no breeding, no blood.
- That'll do, Carraclough.
- Yes, sir.
- Priscilla?
- Yes, Grandfather.
Have you ever seen this dog before?
- No, Grandfather.
- Neither have I.
I thought for a minute, but I was mistaken.
This is no dog of mine.
Upon my soul and honor, this dog never belonged to me.
Come along, child. We've got to be going.
- Carraclough.
- Yes, sir?
That dog looks to me as if she needs a lot of care.
She does that, sir.
She'll get all the care she needs up at my kennels.
- Indeed she will, sir.
- Goodbye, Carraclough.
- I'm so glad you're going to be with me.
- Thank you, Your Grace.
- Goodbye, Mrs. Carraclough.
- Goodbye, Your Grace.
- Come along, child.
- Goodbye.
Goodbye, child.
Thank you, sir.
Do you think he knew?
Bless you, he knew.
She's our Joe's Lassie again.
We'll soon have thee well again, girl.
She wants to meet Joe.
But the poor thing's so weak.
We shouldn't let her go, Sam.
Aye, but she's walked hundreds of miles to see our lad.
- I'll not rob her of that now.
- Then wait.
So he'll know.
Off you go now.
Lassie!
You're my Lassie come home.
Make mine music
Make mine music
And my heart will sing
Make mine music
And it's always spring
All the world goes romancing
When melody fills the night
And even the stars go dancing
To the music of the moonlight
Make mine music
And I'll dream of you
Make mine music
And the dream comes true
Music will play the shadows away
When everything seems to go wrong
So make mine music
And life will be a song
Make mine music
Gather round me, children, and I'll tell a story
Of the mountains in the days when guns was law
When two families got disputin'
It was bound to end in shootin'
So just listen and I'll tell you what I saw
Oh, the Martins and the Coys
They was reckless mountain boys
And they took up family feudin' when they'd meet
Every durn time!
They could shot each other quicker than it took your eye to flicker
They could knock a squirrel's eye out at 90 feet
All their fightin' started one bright Sunday morning
I remember!
Cos old Grandpa Coy was full of mountain dew ...
Just as quiet as a church mouse
He stole into the Martins' henhouse
Cos the Coys, they needed eggs for breakfast too
After that they started out to fight in earnest
And they scarred the mountains up with shot and shell
There was uncles, brothers, cousins
Why, they bumped them off by dozens
Just how many bit the dust is hard to tell
Oh, the Martins and the Coys
They were reckless mountain boys
At the art of killin' they became quite deft
Mighty deft
They all knowed they shouldn't do it
But before they hardly knew it
On each side they only had one person left
Only one person left
Now, the sole remaining Martin was a maiden
And as pretty as a picture was this Grace
- While the one survivin' boy
- Was the handsome Henry Coy
And the folks all knew they'd soon meet face to face
- After her, Henry!
- Go get her, boy!
- Knock him off, Gracie!
- Shoot that Coy!
So they finally met upon a mountain pathway
And Henry Coy, he aimed his gun at Grace
Right at Grace
He was set to pull the trigger when he saw her pretty figure
You could see that love had kicked him in the face
Oh, the Martins and the Coys
They were reckless mountain boys
But they say their ghostly cussin' gives you chills
Cos the hatchet sure was buried when sweet Grace and Henry married
It broke up the best durn feud in these here hills
Come on, everybody, let's dance!
Way down yonder, not far off, a jay bird died with the whoopin' cough
Do si do, little more dough, chicken in the bread pan pickin' out dough
"Granny, will your dog bite?". "No, child, no, he lost his teeth a long time ago"
Now swing your partners,
And promenade the hall,
Same old road, same old train
Watch that monkey walk that rail
Now first couple out to the right
Go round that couple and take a peek
Come back to the centre and shake your feet
Round that couple and peek once more
Back in the centre and circle four
Swing your partner and call your hound
Right foot up and left foot down
Bottom of your foot make a hole in the ground
Now you're tall with a smile
Once and a half and go hog wild
Sooey, hog, sooey!
Look at him run!
What's the hurry, Henry?
Now you may think that this is where the story ended
But I'm tellin'you them ghosts don't cuss no more
Cos since Grace and Henry wedded they fight worse than all the rest did
And they carry on the feud just like before
Roll along, blue bayou
Through the silv'ry foam
In the deep where sleepy shadows roam
While we roll, blue bayou
In your dreamy light
Memories echo in my heart tonight
I hear the echo of our song of love
Murmuring low
And here am I
Still haunted by
The ghost of long ago
Roll along, blue bayou
Through the silv'ry foam
Roll the blue and sleepy shadows home
Roll along, blue bayou
Through the silv'ry foam
In the deep where sleepy shadows roam
While we roll, blue bayou
In your dreamy light
Memories echo in my heart tonight
Roll along, blue bayou
Through the silv'ry foam
Roll the blue and sleepy shadows home
Roll along, blue bayou
Through the silv'ry foam
Roll the blue and sleepy shadows home
Across the blue moon
Boy!
Hop in the old jalop and...
Head for the malted shop and...
All the cats join in
Down goes my last two bits
Comes up one banana split
And all the cats join in
Drop your jack in the old jukebox
Play your favourite disc
When you dance with the bobby socks
You dance at your own risk
RIP
Everybody swing
Yes, swing till the rafters ring
And all the cats join in
Rafters ringing, how they're swinging
All the cats join in
I'm so lonely and blue
When I'm without you
I don't know what I'd do, sweetheart.
Without you
The joy and tears that love endears
Would have no meaning
If I didn't have you
To keep me dreaming
At the close of each day
When I'm without you
And my heart kneels to pray
I pray about you
You take a star
And lead it far away from heaven
And the star will be lost
As I'm lost without you
At the close of each day
When I'm without you
And my heart kneels to pray
I pray about you
You take a star
And lead it far away from heaven
And the star will be lost
As I'm lost without you
Oh, what a lark to ride out to the park
And just to see Casey
They travelled for miles and they stand in the aisles
And just to see Casey
The ladies don't understand baseball a bit
They don't know a strike from a foul or a hit
But when they see Casey that dame has got it
Casey, the pride of them all
The outlook wasn't brilliant for the Mudville nine that day
The score was four to two
With but one inning left to play
Listen, ya bunch of bush leaguers, it's the ninth inning!
It's the wind-up! The blow-off!
Come on, unbutton your shirts!
Now get in there and fight!
Who's up next?
Cooney!
The coach was really worried when Cooney went to bat
For all he had to offer was 300 pounds of fat
Ah, but Cooney was determined, he tried to do his worst
He kept his batting average, all right
And as usual died at first
You're out!
Hooray for our side! Hooray! Hooray!
- Aw, shut up!
- Sit down!
- I'll kick the stuffin' out of him!
- Yeah, run that guy outta town!
Barrows was the next one up, and Barrows made a hit
Wow, he smacked a beauty - right in the pitcher's mitt
You're out!
A straggling few got up to go
Ah, but the loyal fans stood pat
They'd put up even money now were Casey at the bat
Ah, but Flynn preceded Casey
Of all the stupid guys
The bat is getting in his hair
Now the hair is getting in his bat
Egad! He let drive a single - much to his own surprise
Safe!
The next one in the line-up was "No Hit" Jimmy Blake
Of all the mugs in Mudville he was the biggest fake
But he was really blazing and to the wonderment of all
Blake the Fake tore the cover off the ball
And when the dust had lifted and they saw what had occurred
There was Jimmy safe at second and Flynn a-huggin' third
Cosy, isn't it?
You're safe!
We want Casey! We want Casey!
We want Casey!
Oh, Casey's the guy with his eye on the ball
But mostly the ladies
Casey's the guy who's the idol of all
But mostly the ladies
Casey is mighty and manly
Casey's a dangerous gent
Egad, when he goes to bat, hang onto your hat
He's batting a thousand percent with the ladies
Oh, Casey has nerve and he knows every curve
He's no hokey-pokey
He gets away with that old double play
He's sure okey-dokey
He makes all the ladies go gaga, it's true
No wonder they swoon when he comes into view
He was the Sinatra of 1902
Casey, the pride of them all
The pitcher's nerves were jagged and his knees began to shake
Ah, can't catch me! Can't catch me!
One eye was watching Flynn and the other eye watching Blake
While the frightened pitcher ground the ball into his hip
Defiance gleamed in Casey's eye
A sneer curled Casey's lip
And now the leather-covered sphere came hurtling through the air
And Casey stood a-watching it in haughty grandeur there
Close by the sturdy batsman the ball unheeded sped
"That ain't my style," said Casey
Strike one!
... the umpire said
From the benches, black with people, there went up a mighty roar
Like the beating of the ocean on a stern and distant shore
Kill him! Kill the umpire!
... yelled the cutie from the stand
And it's likely they'd have killed him
Had not Casey raised his hand
With a smile of Christian charity great Casey's visage shone
He stilled the rising tumult and bade the game go on
He signalled to the pitcher and once more the spheroid flew
But Casey still ignored it and the umpire said, quote:
Strike two!
Unquote.
"Fraud!" cried the maddened thousands, and the echo answered "Fraud!"
But one scornful look from Casey...
And the audience was awed
They saw his face grow stern and cold
They saw his muscles strain
And they knew that Casey would not let that ball go by again
The sneer has gone from Casey's lip
His teeth are clenched in hate
He pounds with cruel violence his bat upon the plate
And now the pitcher holds the ball
And now he lets it go
And now the air is shattered by the force of Casey's blow
Somewhere in this favoured land
The sun is shining bright
Ah, yes...
Somewhere bands are playing sweet
And somewhere hearts are light
Somewhere men are laughing
Somewhere children shout
But there is no joy in Mudville -
Mighty Casey has struck out
Casey, the pride of them all!
Whaddaya know? The game is over.
Two silhouettes
Together in the afterglow
Two silhouettes
Become as one
When lights are low
And with the night slumbering on
We'll build a dream for two
A perfect dream
Set to a theme lovely as you
Two hearts on fire
Will soon inspire
The stars to dance
The flames that stray
Will light the way
To our romance
And when I hold you in my arms
To my heart's delight
Two silhouettes will drift away into the night
Two hearts on fire
Will soon inspire
The stars to dance
The flames that stray
Will light the way
To our romance
And when I hold you in my arms
To my heart's delight
Two silhouettes
Will drift away
Into the night
Will drift away
Into the night
Now, this is the story of...
Peter and the Wolf.
As you know, in the musical score of Peter and the Wolf each character is represented by an instrument in the orchestra -
Peter by the string quartet.
The bird, whose name is Sasha, by a flute, way up high.
Sonia, the duck, by an oboe. Like this...
And here is Ivan, the cat, represented by a clarinet in a very low register.
Grandpapa is an old bassoon.
The shooting of the hunters' guns by the kettledrums.
And there is also a wolf.
Little does that wolf know what's in store for him this day.
For our hero, little Peter, armed to the teeth, is setting forth to capture him.
There seems to have been a change of plans.
For Peter's grandpapa thinks that little boys like Peter should not go out to hunt the wolf.
This is very embarrassing for a great hunter.
This is Sasha, the little bird we told you about.
Excitable little chap, isn't he?
Forgetful, too.
"Hello, Petey. Where you goin'?
Can I go, Petey? Can I?"
"Oh, boy, a gun!"
"Loaded, too. "
"Goin' hunting? Oh, that's for me!"
"Everything's OK, Petey.
Come on, let's go. "
The wolf!
But it isn't the wolf at all.
It's only Sonia the duck.
"Hello, Sonia. "
"Hello, Petey. "
Now Sonia wants to join the party.
Imagination is a wonderful thing.
But sometimes it can run away with you.
"You coward!"
Now who's this?
Oh, it can't be...
Oh, no. It's Ivan the cat.
Hello, Ivan.
Ivan's a peaceful, fun-loving sort - maybe a little shy on brains. You know the type.
Hey, look out, Sasha!
"Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it!"
Oh, how can they ever get any place if they're going to fight among themselves?
Ivan, you ought to be ashamed.
"You big bully!"
"You cat in the grass!"
Come on, Sasha. Ivan's sorry.
He won't do it again.
And so, once more, our little band of intrepid hunters sets forth to find the wolf.
And they find him.
Sonia! Sonia!
Behind you! Look out!
W-O-L-F!
Oh, that wolf is everywhere!
Peter, do something!
Oh, no.
Look, Peter, why don't you...
Maybe if you could...
Then maybe, Peter... Oh, well...
Peter, don't just stand that way.
Don't stand that way, either.
Oh, Sonia!
This is no time to relax.
Poor Sonia.
Well, that's one gone.
Goodbye, Sonia.
Will this crime go unavenged?
Not if little Sasha can help it.
You beast!
Take this! And this! And this!
How do you like this, eh?
And this, eh?
How about this, eh?
Not so good, eh?
Good work, Sasha!
Trouble.
Sasha! Sasha, get up!
Get up! Get out of there!
Look out, please, for over-confidence.
This is bad.
This is very bad.
Saved!
Just when things are looking blackest...
Hark! What's that we hear?
What's this we see?
The hunters!
Misha, Yasha and Vladimir.
That's Vladimir in the middle.
Wait a minute, I'll show you.
W-O-L-F. Wolf.
Wolf?
To the rescue!
Oh, Peter, you're safe!
You've captured the wolf.
Oh, happy day!
I think I'll say that again.
Oh, happy day!
Oh, Peter, what a hero!
You too, Ivan.
Everybody's happy - except the wolf.
But little Sasha isn't happy.
He's thinking of his lost playmate, Sonia.
Sonia...
Sonia?
Sonia! Then you're not dead!
You're safe!
Oh, Sonia, this is the most wonderful, wonderful day!
The wolf is captured - Peter caught him!
One, two, three...
Johnnie Fedora met Alice Bluebonnet
In the window of a department store
'Twas love at first sight
And they promised one night
They'd be sweethearts for evermore
Johnnie would serenade Alice
Toora-lay, toora-li, toora-lu
He sang of a beautiful palace
Of a beautiful hatbox for two
But Johnnie Fedora lost Alice Bluebonnet
To a patron of the department store
Her beauty was sought by the girl she was bought by
For twenty-three ninety-four
Johnnie, O Johnnie
Your Alice Bluebonnet
Will always be waiting for you
So don't give up hoping
And don't give up dreaming
For true love will come smiling through
Johnnie Fedora was lonely and stranded
In the window of the department store
When, lo and behold
He was suddenly sold
And his heart became gay once more
Johnnie sang out like a robin
Toora-lay, toora-li, toora-lu
To strangers he'd come up a-bobbin'
"I thought you were someone I knew "
He looked for her uptown and crosstown and downtown
From the Brooklyn Bridge to the Jersey shore
It all seemed in vain
Till he heard the refrain
Of the song Alice sang of yore
Johnnie, O Johnnie!
Your Alice Bluebonnet
Will always be waiting for you
So don't give up hoping
And don't give up dreaming
For true love will come smiling through
Johnnie kept yearning, he kept on returning
To the window of the department store
His voice became hushed
He was literally crushed
And it started to rain and pour
Each place he went he kept calling
- Toora-lay
- Toora-li
- Toora-lu
- La la la
His spirits kept falling and falling
For his Alice was nowhere in view
But hey-noni-noni, an ice man found Johnnie
And he cut him to fit on his horse's ears
'Twas done without malice
For beside him was Alice
And they lived on for years and years
Giddup!
You Johnnie Fedoras
You Alice Bluebonnets
Whenever you find yourself blue
You'll find it's June in December
If you just remember
That true love will come smiling through
That true love will come smiling through
This is how it all began
Just a little back-page item about a voice that sang at sea
And then this fantastic news appeared on the front page
And then in screaming headlines
Extra! Read all about it! Paper!
A singing whale?
- Whaddaya know ?
- Imagine that
Huh! I don't believe it
I don't believe it
For who ever heard of an operatic whale?
I don't believe it
I don't believe it
And headline followed headline
Then doctors and experts
And men of anatomical biology
Debated and argued
And quoted ichthyology
Impossible! Preposterous!
We savagely deny it
Magnificent! Miraculous!
We certainly certify it
And even the great impresario
Of the Grand Opera
Raised an eyebrow
And tried and tried to figure it out
This whale, she's maybe swallowed an opera singer.
That's it! This whale, she's a-swallowed an opera singer!
I find-a the great Signor Donatelli in-a the fish market.
I discovered the great Lilli Garli in-a the honky-tonky.
Why not I find-a the opera singer in-a the belly of a whale, huh?
I do it!
Oh, get me a great big schooner and get me a good harpooner
Photographers and reporters from all the newspapers
Publicity! Publicity!
Publicity!
Publicity, yes. But to Whitey the seagull, it was opportunity - the big opportunity for his friend Willie the whale.
There was no time to lose.
He must bring these two together.
Well, there was Tetti-Tatti now.
And Tetti-Tatti was in for a wonderful surprise.
Because Willie hadn't swallowed any opera singer, he could really sing.
Listen.
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin', shortnin'
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin' bread
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin', shortnin'
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin' bread
Two little chillun, lyin' in bed
One of 'em sick and the other 'most dead
Called for the doctor, the doctor said
"Feed them chillun on shortnin' bread"
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin', shortnin'
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin' bread
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin', shortnin'
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin' bread
After all these years of casting his "Shortnin' Bread" upon the waters, now at last success lay just over the waves.
Willie! Willie, look!
That's you, Willie!
He's looking for you!
It's your big opportunity.
Willie's going to be a great star.
Our Willie, going to sing grand opera.
Goodbye, my friends.
I'm off to be discovered
I'm off to be discovered
At last, the long years of patient waiting, the endless hours of faithful practice were about to be rewarded.
As Willie sped to his audition he wondered what to sing for his opening number.
What would impress this impresario?
How about a bit of Figaro?
Yes, sure, Figaro.
There she's blows! There she's blows!
Figaro.
Figaro!
Figaro!
Figaro! Figaro! Figaro!
Figaro! Figaro! Figaro! Figaro!
Figaro! Figaro! Figaro! Figaro!
Figaro!
Shoot-a de whale!
Figaro!
Figaro!
Figaro!
Hurry up, hurry up!
Rescue the opera singer!
Don't-a worry, we'll a-save you!
Bravo!
Bravissimo! Bravo!
Ah, but they hadn't heard the half of it.
They hadn't even heard a third of it.
For Willie was no ordinary singing whale.
Willie could sing in three separate voices: tenor... baritone... and bass.
Why, Willie was a singing miracle.
Let-a me up! This is the mutiny!
Mamma mia!
He's-a swallowed two opera singers!
He's-a swallowed three opera singers!
Stubborn, deluded Tetti-Tatti.
For right before his very eyes was the biggest discovery in all musical history.
Just imagine, a whale singing opera on the very stage of the Met.
Bravo! Bravissimo!
Je suis Méphisto
Roi d'enfer
Je veux...
Ta vie
I got him! I got him!
Vittoria!
Now Willie will never sing at the Met.
But don't be too harsh on Tetti-Tatti.
He just didn't understand.
You see, Willie's singing was a miracle, and people aren't used to miracles.
And you, faithful little friend, don't be too sad.
Because miracles never really die, and somewhere in whatever heaven is reserved for creatures of the deep,
Willie is still singing - in a hundred voices, each more golden than before.
And he'll go on singing, amid the applause and the cheering, forever.

Long, long ago,
in a faraway land across the sea,
there lived a little boy
who considered himself
quite an authority on brave,
fearless knights.
And their mortal enemies,
those horrible fire-breathing dragons
that daily terrorize the countryside.
One afternoon as the boy sat
deeply engrossed in his favourite su...
- Good afternoon, Father.
- Oh, son, I seen it.
Up on the bounds it was, all covered with scales and such.
And a tail with a sort of a hook on it.
Now wait until I catch my breath.
It's horrible. That's what it is, horrible.
It's only a dragon, Father.
Only a dragon?!
Oh, the village!
Help! There's a dragon coming! Help!
Don't worry, Father.
I'll have a look at him.
Hello, Dragon.
Oh, now, boy. Don't you throw stones at me or squirt water or anything
I won't have it.
Oh, I just came for a friendly chat.
But if I'm not wanted...
Oh, well, do be seated.
- Well, thank you.
- But if you don't mind...
...the other way, please?
I'll only be a minute.
Have you had any nice battles lately?
Battle?
Oh, no, no. No battles. No.
Oh, probably too busy scourging our countryside and devouring fair damsels, then.
Scourging, devouring?
Good heavens, no.
But don't you ever do anything desperate?
Well, yes, I...
I do make up poetry.
Poetry?
Verses, you know.
Care to hear my latest sonnet?
- Well, I...
- Oh, you'll love this.
I call it "Just A-Drifting."
Just a-drifting o'er the leaves
Like a dewdrop, fancy-free
Playing with the gentle breezes
Romping with the bumblebeeses
Oh, what fun,
Joy never ceases
Just a-drifting
Very nice.
But you're in for trouble, you know.
- Trouble?
- My father's arousing the village.
And they'll be here with spears and things to exterminate you.
You're an enemy of the human race.
Oh, I haven't an enemy in the world.
Too nice to make them.
Prancing, dancing to and fro
Not too fast, not too slow
Where the early birds are seeking
Early worms are slyly peeking
Hear the night owls softly squeaking
Just a-drifting
Hey, what's all the excitement?
It's Sir Giles, stupid.
Sir Giles?
Hooray for Sir Giles.
Hooray for Sir Giles.
Hooray for the dragon-killer.
Hooray for the dra...
Dragon-killer.
Oh, gosh.
It's all out, Dragon.
He's coming.
- He's here now.
- Now, boy.
It's impolite to interrupt a person.
- Who's coming?
- Sir Giles.
On a big horse with a long sword and spear.
You'll have to fight him.
Oh, I never fight. I never did.
- Doesn't agree with me.
- But... But... But...
Now, boy, now, boy. Just run along.
Tell Sir Giles to go home.
I'm sure you can arrange it.
Toodle-loo.
All right, now. All right, off you go.
Sir Giles can't be disturbed.
Sure, he's in conference, he is.
There ain't no one, absolutely no one, can see Sir Giles.
Now off you go. Off you go.
Away with you.
Excuse me, sir. I've come to...
Sir Giles, I presume?
Come, come, come, lad.
Stop mumbling.
- I came to talk about the Dragon.
- Oh, yes, yes, yes.
Another tale of woe and misery,
I suppose.
Devoured your flocks, no doubt.
Oh, no, sir. He...
Made off with your loving parents, has he?
Well, they shall be avenged.
- You don't understand.
- What?
Don't tell me he's kidnapped some fair damsel.
With flaxen hair and ruby lips and form divine.
Why, he can't do that to her.
He shall pay dearly on the field of battle.
But that's just it. He won't fight.
Yes, he...
He won't fight?
Preposterous.
The fellow must be an infernal cad.
Bit of a rotter, what?
He is not. He's a nice old dragon who likes to write poetry.
Poetry?
Yes, you know, verses?
How jolly.
I'm a bit of a bard myself, you know.
- You a poet too?
- Yes.
No doubt you heard of my "Ode to a Fleecy Cloud"?
- Well, I...
- Oh, fleecy cloud
O cloud of fleece
Up in the sky so high
Oh, my.
Oh, my.
But come, come. Let's not dilly-dally.
We must meet this fine fellow at once.
Then you'll explain to the Dragon about the fight?
Yes, quite right. Quite right.
Of course, of course, of course.
Quite, quite, quite.
I'm the reluctant dragon
What ho!
Quite so
The very reluctant dragon
Oh, very, very
Don't you know
They call me the timid dragon
What rot!
I'm not!
I just won't fight
I'd rather play
- I know I shan't get hurt that way
- Hello, Dragon.
Oh, hello, boy.
I'm having a picnic.
- I brought a friend to explain about...
- Oh, well, well, splendid.
The more, the merrier. Now, boy, you sit here and your friend can sit there.
- Thank you.
- Now, let's see now.
Pickles, jam, muffins, tea. Oh, yes.
Here, do have a jam sandwich, sir...?
Sir...?
What did you say your friend's name was?
Oh, that's Sir Giles.
Sir Giles. Well, well.
Yes, you know, the dragon-killer.
Sir Giles, you better tell the Dragon, quick.
Oh, yes, of course.
Hey, you know,
I've been looking forward to meeting you.
The boy here tells me you're quite an accomplished poet.
- Oh, he did, really?
- Yes, yes, yes.
And if it's not too much bother,
I'd be pleased to hear you recite.
Oh, my dear, dear fellow, no bother.
No bother at all.
Would you care for a sandwich?
Thank you. Jam.
Here. Do have another sandwich and a piece of cake and a crumpet and a lolly and a spot of tea.
Thank you.
This... This is called
"To An Upside-down Cake".
Sweet little upside-down cake
Cares and woes, you've got them.
Poor little upside-down cake
Your top is on your bottom.
Alas, little upside-down cake
Your troubles never stop
Because, little upside-down cake
Your bottom's on your top
Bravo. Quite interesting. Extraordinary.
Now, Sir Giles. Tell the Dragon now.
Oh, yes, of course.
You know, I am a bit of a bard myself.
Really? Oh, how nice.
Yes, yes, yes. Quite, quite.
Radish so red
Radish so red
Plucked from the heart
Of your warm little bed
Sprinkled with salt
On the top of your head
Delicious
Oh, that's exquisite. Simply exquisite.
Yes, of course. You're quite right.
Do you mind if I recite a poem?
You, boy? Why... Oh, not at all.
Oh, of course, of course.
Rather, rather.
'Tis evening
From the stars above
A soft mysterious light
Brings thoughts of friendship
Joy and love
Now how about that fight?!
Splendid. Quite.
Fight? Fight?
There's nothing to fight about.
Besides, I don't believe in it.
But dragons and knights always fight.
- That's right, by Jove.
- You can't disappoint the whole village.
- Not cricket, you know.
- Please, I...
I do not wish to discuss it further.
I refuse to listen.
I absolutely will not fight.
Good night.
Well, you know, it's a shame.
It doesn't seem right.
This is really a beautiful spot.
- For a fight.
- Yes, quite right.
Why, I can almost see it.
The flags are waving.
The people are cheering.
- Bands are playing.
- The Dragon appears.
What a beautiful sight, with his scales all agleam in the dawn's early light.
You're just flattering me.
Oh, no, fellow. It's true.
That beautiful damsel throws flowers at you.
- At me?
- At you.
As I ramp and I roar, I cut quite a figure.
Sir Giles has a spear just like this, only bigger.
I get set for the charge and...
Did you say spear?
Yes, spear.
Oh, dear.
No. I'll get hurt. I won't do it. Good day.
Just a second, old chap.
We might fix it this way.
You mean:
Quite so.
But are you sure it's quite honest?
Just a second, we'll look.
Nothing against it here in the book.
No, nothing against it here in the book.
If it looks like a battle,
I'm sure it's all right.
Very well, then, it's settled.
Tomorrow, we fight.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
There's going to be a fight
There's going to be a fight
A fight.
Boy. Sir Giles. Wait a minute.
Oh, wait, please.
Oh, why don't
I keep my big mouth shut?
So the next day, the villagers gathered
to see the valiant knight
engage the bloodthirsty Dragon
in a battle to the finish.
- So I am getting 20-to-1 on Sir Giles.
- That's twopence on the Dragon.
All right, on the Dragon.
Twopence on the Dragon.
You're a smart one.
Balloons. Only a bit for a balloon.
They're amusing, inexpensive.
A nice side seat and a nice side spot.
Here now, mind your step, lady.
Mind your step.
Look, the Dragon ain't got a chance.
Aye, he'll do the Dragon in.
Hooray, Sir Giles! Hooray!
It's no use.
You might as well tell the people to go away.
I can't do it.
- Oh, but try again.
- You've got to be mad to breathe fire.
But I'm not mad at anybody.
But try real hard. Concentrate.
Not very good, is it?
Nope. Too bad you're not a real dragon instead of a punk poet.
Punk poet?!
Oh, say that again.
- Punk poet.
- Again.
- Punk poet!
- Again.
Punk poet!
- Oh, I'm mad, I'm mad!
- Punk poet! Punk poet! Punk poet!
Punk poet!
Oh, again, again!
Punk poet!
By Jove.
Hooray for the Dragon!
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!
Dragon.
Dragon.
Extraordinary.
Why, he's disappeared.
- Here I am.
- Oh, so you are.
- Am I doing all right?
- I say, old boy.
Stop acting the silly ass, will you?
Help! Oh, no!
Oh, help!
- I say, you hack...!
- No, no stop it!
- Oh, no, stop! Stop it! Oh, no, you can't!
- That's it. Steady now.
- You can't do that!
- Raise the gate. Raise the gate. Hey.
No, no, no. No, fire.
It's horrible, ain't it?
- Oh, no!
- Help, please.
One lump or two? Help!
Don't mind if I do.
- Hey, you vulgar...!
- Help! Help!
Now I'll chase you.
- Help! Oh, no, no, no.
- Hey!
- Help!
- Steady now.
Hey, Sir Giles.
Egad.
Hooray, Sir Giles! Hooray!
Hooray, Dragon! Hooray!
Hooray, Sir Giles!
Hooray, Dragon!
Hooray, Sir Giles! Hooray, Dragon!
Hooray, Sir Giles! Hooray, Dragon!
Hooray, Sir Giles! Hooray, Dragon!
- Help!
- Take that!
- Horrible!
- Hey, cut it out! No, no, no.
- Help!
- Take that!
- Stop it. Oh, no.
- Stay the game.
The time has come, you know.
- You mean I die now?
- Oh, yes, indeed.
As per agreed, we'll seal our pact, old thing.
Take that!
- Hooray!
- Hooray for Sir Giles!
And so as per agreed,
Sir Giles completely reformed
this ferocious dragon,
whereupon the satisfied villagers
welcomed him into society.
Speech, speech, speech!
I promise not to rant or roar and scourge the countryside anymore.

Why don't you look where you're going?
Come on, butterfingers.
Throw it here. Come on.
Okay, let's play ball. Come on, now.
- Hey, Murphy.
- What do you want?
- Let me in, will you?
- Get outta here.
- I got some Sweet Caporal cards!
- Who you got?
Hans Wagner. Grover Cleveland Alexander.
Them old-timers?
- Tris Speaker, Johnny Evers.
- Has-beens.
- Christy Mathewson.
- A dime a dozen.
Who you holdin' out?
Babe Ruth.
A rookie. Come on, let's play ball!
Come on. Three strikes and he's out.
Put it over the plate now. Come on.
He can't hit anything. Come on!
- What's the matter?
- Sasha.
- Yeah, Mom?
- Your professor's here. Come and take.
In a minute, Mom.
Not in a minute, Sasha. Now!
All right.
Hey, you. Come here.
- You gonna let me take his place?
- Gimme the cards.
Sure, Murph.
- Can I keep Babe Ruth?
- Keep him.
- Gee, thanks.
- Okay, let's play ball.
Get off the sack.
Okay. Let's go, come on.
He's a southpaw, come on. Over the plate, now.
Let's see a good one.
- What's your name?
- Lou Gehrig.
Well, what about it?
We can't wait here all day.
I can't do anything without my wife.
I didn't mean to do it, Mom.
I didn't know I could hit that far.
He busted Colletti's window.
Baseball.
- How much?
I told him, Mama, he should carry glass insurance.
Mr. Colletti, let me work it out after school.
- I'll run errands.
- No, Louie.
What we break, we pay for.
$16.25 leaves $2.25 I owe you.
- I pay you Saturday.
- Okay, Mrs. Gehrig.
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry, too.
Me, too, Mom.
You'd better be, young Gehrig.
I'm telling you, that was a mighty wallop.
I feel awful about it, Mom. Honest, I do.
I'll pay you back the money.
I promised to fix Mrs. Reagan's dumbwaiter.
It isn't just the money, Lou, it's the time you waste.
I'll get my working papers. I'll quit school.
Quit school?
How can you say that?
How many times have I told you?
I want you to go to school, and high school, and college and...
Look at your papa. Look at me.
We didn't go to school, and what are we?
A janitor. A cook.
I want you to be somebody.
Sure, Mom.
Like your Uncle Otto, Louie.
He went to university. He graduated.
Don't you see, Louie?
That's why I'm cooking at Columbia, so you can go there some day...
...and be an engineer like your Uncle Otto.
Mom, maybe I ain't cut out to be an engineer.
- What do you want to be?
- I want to be a...
- I don't know.
- You've got to know.
In this country, you can be anything you want to be.
Don't you want to be an engineer like your Uncle Otto?
- Don't you?
- Sure, Mom.
Whatever you want me to be.
This fraternity has standards.
You can't ignore his family.
- He's a cinch to be a four-letter man.
- His mother's the best cook at Columbia.
Somehow that doesn't add up to Sigma Alpha Psi, in my mind.
Lou's all right, Van.
- I'm trying to maintain a certain standard.
- Gold standard?
How would you like to get this right in the...
Hold on.
Let's put it to a vote.
All those in favor of pledging Lou Gehrig...
Carried.
Go ahead, if that's what you want.
I won't stand in your way.
Hang a pledge pin on him.
Don't expect me to call him brother.
Let's eat.
I don't know why this has to happen every night before dinner.
You certainly smacked that ball around this afternoon.
Yeah. Tough on the guys who live in the dormitories.
You never know when you're going to get a baseball in your geometry.
- What's your batting average now?
- I'll swap it for your math grade.
Hold it, Lou.
Thanks, fellows.
This is an honor.
You know, I'm not much on talking.
I just would like to say...
...thanks, fellows.
- Welcome in, Lou.
- He's a swell guy.
- Hi, Mom.
- What?
I just said hi.
Hi. The soup is getting cold.
- Mom.
- What?
Look.
- Lou, they took you in.
- Yeah, just now.
Everything's going so fine now.
First Columbia, then a fraternity, and the next thing, you will be an engineer.
This is just the pledge pin.
I get the real pin before long.
And when I get it,
I'm supposed to give it to my best girl.
You still my best girl, Mom?
Always.
It'll mean you'll have to go steady with me.
You can't look at anybody else.
Not even Papa?
All right, Papa.
Well, Sam. I'm going to build my football team around a new man next fall.
A great halfback.
Somebody gunning for you, Jim?
I guess it's always open season on football coaches.
Especially to you sportswriters.
That's the halfback I was telling you about.
Lou Gehrig, a line-plunging fool.
Football?
For a kid that can hit a baseball this far?
There's a pretty stiff wind blowing in this direction.
That wind could blow him into the major leagues.
Lay off. That happened to Eddie Collins...
...the greatest second baseman we had at Columbia.
It spread all over the sports pages, and then he's playing professional baseball.
Lay off of this kid, will you?
I'm a newspaperman, Jim, and that sure was some wallop.
If you won't introduce me, then I'll just go right up and introduce myself.
I can't bear not meeting him.
Mr. Gehrig.
I suppose you'll think I'm terribly fresh, but I just couldn't stand it another minute.
Lou, you seem to have made a conquest.
Mile-a-minute Myra, the all-American prom-trotter.
Miss Tinsley, may I present Mr. Gehrig?
- How do you do?
- I do, Mr. Gehrig, just wonderful.
What chance have I got against a great athlete?
Pay no attention to me.
I'll just go away somewhere and drink myself to death.
Aren't you going to ask me to dance?
Wouldn't you condescend to dance with a little Miss Nobody like me?
- I guess I don't dance very well.
- You and your modesty.
Athletes do everything well.
Don't you want to dance with me?
Would you care to dance, Miss Tinsley?
I'd adore to.
I could just die dancing with you.
But it seems such a waste of time.
I want to talk to you.
I know a place we can be all by our lonesome.
It'll be just wonderful.
You know what?
I never danced before in my life.
- Now...
- I wouldn't kid you. I'd never kid you.
I was scared stiff, Miss Tinsley.
Myra.
Myra, would you like to dance again?
Later.
First, I want to know all about you.
Go on, tell me.
There isn't anything.
A great big, famous person like you?
You've even had your name in the paper.
Tell me, do you just adore baseball?
You see, I'm not gonna be a ballplayer.
Mom wants me to be an engineer.
You're going to do what she wants?
Of course.
I think that's just adorable.
Gonna be an old engineer that never gets his name in the paper.
Just 'cause your mother wants you to.
You're wonderful.
You're the one that's wonderful.
Now, Mr. Gehrig...
Lou.
Are you going to remember me, Lou?
Remember you?
Maybe these will help you to.
Of course they will.
Because they're like you.
- "Night and day time, always play..."
- Hey, Myra.
Where have you been? How about our dance?
Excuse me, Lou.
"And the poor get poorer
"In the meantime, in between time, ain't we got fun?"
Here he is now, the pride of the ballroom.
- Quit kidding, will you?
- I wouldn't kid you.
I'd never kid you.
- Come on, eat.
- Nice work, Lou. You're wonderful.
No, I'm not.
You're the one that's wonderful.
What are you going to be when you grow up, Van?
I'd like to be a great, big fireman because I'm so good at it.
But the mater won't let me.
- She wants me to be a motorman.
- Hey, what is all this?
Van, even though the big-league teams are begging you...
...on their bended knees to join them, you will remember us, won't you?
I don't need anything to make me remember you.
But I'd like to have these...
...because they're like you.
He was only joking.
A man from the Yankees is looking for you.
- More jokes?
- Gehrig? My name's Blake.
Miller Huggins of the Yankees...
- You're trying to be funny, too?
- Wait a minute.
Say, Lou.
What made you give Mr. Blake the rush act last night?
He came up to your fraternity house to do you a favor.
You mean that he...
You mean that you want to...
Wait a minute. Let's start over again.
This is Sam Blake of the Evening Standard.
Lou Gehrig.
You don't have to play with the Yankees, but it's no insult to be asked.
The Yankees?
- You mean the New York Yankees?
- Not the Chillicothe Yankees.
Thanks.
That's wonderful.
But...
...I'm gonna be an engineer.
Engineer.
- Don't get up, Mama. I'll get it for you.
- I can do it. I'm all right.
No, you're not all right. You stay here.
- What's the matter, Pop?
- Mom is sick.
- It's nothing.
- It's something, Lou.
- I'll get a doctor.
- Never mind. He'll cost $2.
I'll get him.
We must get your wife to the hospital immediately.
The general hospital is rather crowded, but I'll see if I can make arrangements.
There must be room in one of the wards.
Mom's not going to a ward.
She's gonna have the best, a good room in a private hospital.
But beggars can't be choosers.
The private hospital costs money, and where are we going to get it?
I know where I can get it.
Tell the doc not to bother.
I'll make all the arrangements.
Aren't you gonna read what you're signing?
No, I'm in a hurry.
Just in case you're interested...
...you're the property of the New York Yankees from now on.
Only, I think we'll have to smooth off the rough edges.
To start with, I'm going to send you up to play with Hartford.
- Here you are.
- Thank you, bye. Bye, Blake.
- Try to keep your afternoons free, will you?
- Sure.
Maybe he signed with the wrong team.
He's nutty enough to play with the Brooklyn Dodgers.
You'll never be sorry you signed him.
Well, I don't know.
That's wonderful, Louie.
But one thing I don't understand.
They send you from New York to Hartford to bring you back to New York.
I'll never understand America.
They're sending me there for the experience I need.
That's the way they work it.
How you going to work it?
- Work what?
- Mama.
Louie.
- How's my best girl?
- Fine.
Mama, I've got to go make a phone call.
Wait a minute. Grab a hold of that.
- How are they treating you, Mom?
- Wonderful.
I can't get over how much they give you here for nothing.
All the city hospitals are free.
Everybody treats me like a queen.
Mom.
- Yes, Louie?
- I want to tell you something.
- Excuse me a minute.
- Wait.
It's nothing, really.
I'm going away, Mom.
I'm going to Hartford.
- You see, Mom...
- Harvard.
Harvard?
That's wonderful.
You are going to be a great engineer.
Harvard's engineering school is good.
But Louie, suppose she finds out?
What about me?
Protect yourself in the clinches, Pop.
What about mail?
Suppose Mama writes you?
She'll write the letters, but you mail them.
What about the money you will be sending me?
- How will I explain that?
- Tell her you got a job.
- A job? Who, me?
- You.
Louie, wait.
- What kind of a job?
- That's up to you.
All aboard.
Politics.
- Good morning, Mrs. Gehrig.
- Good morning, Mrs. Roberts.
You saw the papers?
Papers? The one says white, the other black.
I never read them.
- You must be proud of your son.
- My Lou? Of course.
But I just can't get over how wonderful everything is with my husband.
Mr. Gehrig, you know?
I had no idea that...
My husband told me in the hospital how wonderful his job was.
I couldn't believe it.
You want to know when he leaves for work?
When he feels like it.
When he doesn't feel like it, he doesn't go to work at all.
Political, at $25 a week.
What is it, Papa?
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.
- What?
- Nothing.
- I couldn't wait for you to come to the door.
- It's in the paper!
- Isn't it wonderful?
- Shut up.
This is great news!
You should be a proud father!
You'll tell me later.
Mr. Gehrig, this is a great day.
- What is it all about?
- Didn't you read in the paper about Lou?
- Paper? Lou?
- Here it is.
Read it.
- Lou?
- Yes.
"Gehrig recalled by Yankees."
We'll talk about it later.
We'll talk about it now.
- Mom.
- Here's Lou now.
Congratulations.
If you don't mind, I think there are a few things
I ought to talk over with the folks.
We understand.
How's my best girl?
- I'd better go, too.
- Where? To work?
I'll be right back, Louie.
About Hartford...
I didn't go there just because
I wanted to play baseball.
I went because we needed the money.
You were sick, and the doctor said you might die.
I wish I had died, rather than see you give up everything we planned.
For what? To play ball.
A disgrace like that.
It's not a disgrace to play with the Yankees.
That's what we came to America for.
A wonderful country where everybody has an equal chance.
That's why you studied, why you went to Columbia...
...so that you could play baseball?
After all my plans for you to follow after your Uncle Otto.
Uncle Otto's dead.
Yes, and he'd turn over in his grave if he knew what happened in the family.
People have to live their own lives.
Nobody can live it for you.
Nobody could make a ballplayer out of him...
...and nobody can make anything but a ballplayer out of me.
You are good for nothing.
All baseballers are good for nothing.
Loafers in short pants.
You've never been to a ball game.
Lots of people go every day.
Men, women, and children.
Maybe there's something to it. Maybe it's fun.
Why don't you come out and watch me play...
...so you can judge for yourself?
- What do you say?
- Never.
- You sure we came to the right ballpark?
- Yes.
And those are not the players?
They are getting the field ready.
What do they do with the pillows?
They are not pillows. They are bases.
- You slide into them.
- I slide into them?
Just watch, Mama.
Just watch.
I can't understand it.
So many people with nothing to do.
Score cards. Get your score cards, folks.
You can't tell the players without a scorecard.
My own son, I can tell.
The others are none of my business.
- Is your son playing?
- Sure. Lou Gehrig.
Gehrig? Never heard of him.
- Substitute?
- No. Yankees.
Scorecards. Get your scorecards.
Hello, Babe.
- Hello, boys. How are you?
- Hey, Babe.
Was that homer yesterday 38 or 39?
Don't know, but I'll hit 'em and you count 'em.
- Where's Lou?
- I don't see him.
You sure we came to the right ballpark?
What did you say the name of this genius was?
Gehrig. Henry Louis Gehrig.
$5 will get you $10, you don't remember any part of it next year.
Henry Blotto Gehrig.
Come on, son. Give me the ball.
Will you give me the ball?
Come on.
Gehrig.
I want you to keep your eye on Wally Pipp, out there on first base.
I know you can hit, but fielding is important, too.
Yeah.
What's the matter, Wally?
You getting weak? Hit it.
What's the matter, Wally? Can't you see him?
Take your time, Wally old boy.
You can do it.
Strike!
- Time.
- Time.
Better take me out, Miller.
I've been seein' double since I was beaned.
That's a tough break. Have Doc look you over.
Too bad, Wally.
Gehrig.
- Who, me?
- Yes, you.
Tanglefoot.
Never mind, that. Get in there for Pipp.
- Get a hold of one, I know you can do it.
- Okay.
Lot of pepper.
Come on, talk it up, you fellows.
Gehrig now batting for Pipp.
- You started something, Eleanor.
- Didn't I?
Dreadful, isn't it?
I seem to have tied a label on that rookie.
Tanglefoot!
Safe!
Omit flowers, please.
Are you putting the jinx on him?
No, Sam.
But you ought to have a nurse around.
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.
Better get to the clubhouse, have the doc look at you.
I'm all right, Mr. Huggins.
Don't take me out now.
I've been waiting too long to get in.
What do we have to do, kill you to get you out of the lineup?
- Babe, we're waiting for you.
- What will it be tonight, Mr. Ruth?
I'll have a couple of those, smothered with pork chops.
- Yes, sir.
- Take it easy.
And mushrooms.
- Maybe some nice fish.
- Say, that's an idea.
The Yankees.
Enjoying your stay in Chicago?
- Hello, Mr. Twitchell.
- Hello, losers.
Hello, Mr. Twitchell.
Gotta let 'em win once in a while.
There's your friend, the Hot Dog King's daughter.
Tell them to bring some horseshoes when they come to New York.
- You can't win with alibis.
- We weren't alibiing.
How's Tanglefoot?
Has he come to yet, or can't you tell?
You gave that rookie an awful riding out there today.
Have you made up your mind yet?
Yes, I think I'll have some lamb chops and pineapple.
Hello, Mr. Blake.
Tanglefoot.
Miss Twitchell. Mr. Gehrig.
All right, we're even.
If we're even, maybe you'll sit down with us.
- Not going to pull it out, are you?
- No.
Mr. Gehrig, I hear this was your first game today.
My first appearance.
And am I glad to get out of the lumber business.
- You don't know what that means.
- I know what it means.
What does it mean?
Picking splinters off of your pants from sitting on the bench so long.
How long do you expect to stay off the bench, Mr. Gehrig?
I'll tell you. I got a hunch
I'm gonna be playing for a long while.
Wally Pipp must be awful sick.
Say...
What are you doing with this Yankee?
- Hello, Sam.
- Hello, Mr. Twitchell.
This is my father.
- How do you do?
- Yankees' new first baseman?
- Yes, sir, at last.
- I like the way you stand up to the ball.
Lot of power there.
Your father knows a player when he sees one.
- Yes, he stands up to the plate fine.
- Yes, he does.
And he falls down on the bats pretty good, too, Dad.
Mr. Tanglefoot.
- Won't you join us, Mr. Twitchell?
- Thank you.
Say, Blake...
...you know a lot about women.
Yeah, sure.
What does it mean when a girl says you remind her of a Newfoundland puppy?
Well, if it was an Airedale, that would be bad.
Or a police dog.
That would be fatal.
But a Newfoundland puppy...
...I'd see her again, if I was you.
I think he's got a pinochle deck.
Hey, where have you been?
Let me out of here.
Boys, where's Lou?
Did he get on the train all right?
Yeah, he got on.
Just hoping, that's all.
I've watched this game for four hands now.
You've had some swell hats, Babe, but this one is tops.
It is beautiful.
Yeah? Now listen, you mugs. Lay off of this one.
If I see anyone touch it, I'll knock his teeth in.
And I'm not kidding.
Deal me in.
Come on. Ante up.
We can look at it, can't we, Babe?
- You know, from a distance?
- Don't try to kid me, Mark.
- You busted my last one.
- Me? No.
No, not Mark.
Don't look too hard.
That's the fifth straw hat I've bought this season and that's the last straw.
The last straw? That's a good gag, Babe.
Get the point?
What a gag.
- I'm in.
- Give me three.
Three to Babe. Coming in.
- Jack?
- Two.
Go ahead, take a bite.
If you're one of us, you'll take a bite.
Take two bites.
What do you got?
Three kings.
Why, you...
- The busher was hungry.
- He didn't need cream and sugar.
That Gehrig's the chump of all time.
Falling for a gag like that.
He doesn't know about gags.
What does he know about, Mr. Bones?
- Baseball.
- He knows! I'll tell you something.
A guy like that is a detriment to any sport.
He's a boob with a batting eye.
He wakes up, brushes his teeth, hikes out to the ballpark...
...hits the ball, hikes back to the hotel room...
...reads the funny papers, gargles, and goes to bed.
That's personality.
- The best.
- A real hero.
Let me tell you about heroes, Hank.
I've covered a lot of them, and I'm saying Gehrig is the best of them.
No front-page scandals, no daffy excitements, no horn-piping in the spotlight.
No nothing.
But a guy who does his job and nothing else.
He lives for his job, he gets a lot of fun out it.
Fifty million other people get a lot of fun out of him...
...watching him do something better than anybody else ever did.
You'd be right, Sam, if all baseball fans were as big boobs as Gehrig.
They are.
The same kind of boobs as Gehrig.
Only without a batting eye.
That's why I'm putting my money on Gehrig.
There's a package for you, Louie.
- I'll take it, Mom.
- No, I'll open it.
- Maybe I'd better pack it just like it is.
- No, I'll open it.
- Where did you say you play first?
- Chicago.
Great town.
They call me Tanglefoot in Chicago.
- Tanglefoot?
- Yeah, only she didn't mean it, I think.
Who?
That is the way you talk about a city.
The city's always "she."
Ships, too.
- What's this?
- That's my new suit.
- You never had one like this before.
- It's what they call a tuxedo.
- Some people call it a tux.
- You wear it when you go out at night.
To a smoker.
Louie.
Am I still your best girl?
Take care of my girl, Pop.
Ball two.
Have you seen Mr. Twitchell, lately?
- Twitchell?
- Yeah.
The fellow we met at the Rathskeller that night, remember?
I didn't know he'd made such an impression on you.
Strike two.
Say you wanted to find Mr. Twitchell.
What would you do?
I don't want to find Mr. Twitchell.
Don't worry, you're bound to run into Eleanor one day.
- Eleanor?
- Yes. She'll know where her father is.
It's really quite simple.
Ball three.
I'll bet Twitchell misses you, too.
Pardon me. Well, Miss Twitchell.
- Hello, Mr. Blake. With us again?
- Back again.
Is your father around?
One of the boys is very anxious to see him.
- Who?
- Lou Gehrig.
Yes. He's talked an awful lot about your father.
- He's practically talked about nothing else.
- Really?
Gehrig. Snap out of it, will you?
Hey, Tanglefoot.
What's the matter? Are you asleep?
You did it again, mister. Here's your doll.
Would you go away?
Would you please go away?
You're next.
See if you can be as lucky as he was.
How am I doin'?
I guess that does it. Shall we eat?
Don't you want to see me shoot?
All right, gents, it's only a nickel.
He wins a prize. Here you are, sir.
That's how easy it is.
- That little fellow must be awful strong.
- Yeah.
Try it again, just to prove that wasn't a fluke.
Go on, try it. There, now watch him.
Here he goes.
He did it before, he'll do it again.
He did it again.
I've never tried that.
I'll ring the bell once for you.
- How about eating?
- I'll just smack it once.
There you are, sir, you're next. All right, now.
- He's a big fellow. Bet he'll break the bell.
- Yeah.
Watch him. He looks like a strong fella.
He might break the machine.
Watch him. Step back.
Here you are. Win a prize.
Let's eat.
Why, aren't you going to ring the bell for me?
- What would you like to eat?
- I'm not so hungry. Go ahead and try it.
All this time, you were saying how hungry you are.
I must have waited too long, because I'm not hungry now.
You, mister. The little lady wants to see how strong you are.
Don't disappoint the little lady.
Come right over, step right up.
Ring the bell, win a prize.
That's all you have to do.
Don't disappoint the little lady.
There you are.
Test your strength, that's all there is to it.
Ring the bell and win a prize.
Watch him, folks. Step right up, a nickel.
That's too bad. Try again, mister.
If at first you don't succeed, you know.
Just as easy as rolling off a log.
Wait a minute, mister. Hold this. Look.
You gotta get your wrists into it.
In anything athletic, you got to get the wrists in. Watch me.
Watch him, folks.
Here he goes, watch him, here he goes.
- He did it again.
- See?
- Here, try it.
- That's all there is to it.
- Like this?
- Yeah, that's it.
Ring the bell and win a prize. That's all...
Here. Beat it, brother.
- Now we eat.
- Boy.
- What would you like to eat?
- Hot dogs and champagne?
Good!
I'll be loving you
always
With a love that's true
always
When the things you've planned
Need a helping hand
I will understand, always
Always
Days may not be fair, always
That's when I'll be there, always
Not for just an hour
Not for just a day
Not for just a year
but always
- To your first World Series.
- Don't say that, not yet.
We've got six more cities waiting for us, and anything can happen.
Did you realize, this is my last night in Chicago this season?
And this is good-bye?
What a lot of 'em.
Six more to go. Six more good-byes.
Six more what?
You play in seven cities when you're on the road.
You must have a girl in every city.
A ballplayer is a lot like a sailor, isn't he?
A girl in every port.
What's Miss Boston's name?
I never said I had a girl in Boston.
Haven't you? What about Philadelphia?
St. Louis? Cleveland? Detroit?
Washington? New York?
You forgot Chicago.
Chicago? Who?
Aren't you my girl?
I don't know what you mean by "your girl."
Your best girl, is that what you mean?
I guess that's what I mean.
I guess I thought you were.
Whatever gave you that idea?
I've seen you four days in a row.
And you're out with me here tonight.
Isn't that what best girls do?
Is it? I wonder if I'm going to miss you.
- Can't you find out before I go?
- Nope. Isn't that too bad?
Why is it like that?
I have no idea.
Seems silly, doesn't it?
I like that tune, don't you?
Dance with me?
Lou, if I do miss you,
I wish I knew how much I were going to.
I wish you knew before I left.
Shall I try?
How?
Shall I...
- Where do you go from here?
- Detroit.
All right.
Close my eyes, and pretend it's tomorrow night...
...and I'm dancing with someone else.
- Yeah, I get the idea.
- All right, ready?
Are you in Detroit?
Yep. I'm sitting in the lobby of the Statler Hotel.
Who am I dancing with?
Let me see. Who do I know?
Harold Chandler, Bill Talbot...
...Jim Johnson, Jack Austin...
...Bill Church, Sam Price...
Hey.
- What?
- You've got a ball club of your own.
I'm tired of this game. I don't like it.
I'm back from Detroit.
And I'm laughing again.
"Not for just an hour
"Not for just a day
"Not for just a year
"but always"
- All right, Babe.
- Hold it. That's it, still.
Hand the ball to the kid.
That's it, Babe. Give us a big smile, Billy.
- Can you sit up a little, son?
- Hold it!
- There you are, kid.
- Let's have one with your arm around him.
- Can you look up at Mr. Ruth, sonny?
- Hold it.
That's it.
- Just one more.
- Right. Go right ahead.
Page one, on every rag from coast to coast, or I go back to the copy desk.
That's enough, boys.
And what's more, Billy, I'm going to hit a home run for you this afternoon...
...and what's more, you can pick your own field...
...left, center or right.
What did you say? Center field? Okay.
- Hey, Babe.
- Yes.
- I wonder if you'd autograph this for me?
- I will.
- Would you autograph mine, too, please?
- Absolutely.
Keep your chin up, Billy.
Mr. Gehrig, will you put your name on it, too?
Sure.
- You're quite a fan, aren't you?
- I haven't missed a game this season.
Yeah.
Thanks.
I like to play baseball.
You'll play again.
You know there isn't anything you can't do, if you try hard enough.
- You think so?
- Sure.
Could you knock a home run for me this afternoon?
But you've already been promised one by Babe Ruth.
Could you?
That's a pretty tall order.
Okay.
Could you knock two homers?
Two homers, in a World Series?
You said that you could do anything if you tried hard enough.
That's what you said.
Yeah.
Okay.
I'll hit two homers for you, if you hit one for me.
Me?
You've got to promise me that...
...one of these days, you're going to get out of bed and go home on your own power.
But how?
If you want to do something hard enough, you can do it.
We can both do it, can't we?
Okay.
- So long, Billy.
- So long, Mr. Gehrig.
- Lou.
- Lou.
It's been announced that all threat of rain has disappeared.
The World Series between
New York and St. Louis...
... will be resumed this afternoon as scheduled.
Good afternoon.
This is Bill Stern, from Sportsman's Park in St. Louis.
This is a World Series that'll make history, go down in history, be history.
The Babe has just stepped up to the plate.
The Babe's going to try for a home run, but it's not for the crowd.
I'll tell you what the crowd doesn't know.
This one's going to be for a little boy in a St. Louis hospital.
It's an IOU from the Sultan of Swat to a little crippled kid.
Will he pay it?
Ball!
There goes a home run out in the center field bleachers.
Ruth at first base.
Yankees come out of their dugout.
A smile all over the faces of the New York Yankees.
Miller Huggins has a grin on his mouth from ear to ear.
Things aren't bad enough here in St. Louis, but the next man up has to be Lou Gehrig.
Ruth is coming into home plate now.
Babe Ruth is pretty good, too.
Gehrig is in the batter's box, in a second, I think we'll be set to go.
Folks, this is going to be a great day for little Billy in the hospital.
I've just been informed that Lou Gehrig has promised to hit two home runs for him.
It's a home run for Lou Gehrig.
A home run for Gehrig.
Gehrig puts it right over the fence.
He really delivered.
The Yankees have come out of their dugout,
Miller Huggins leading them.
What a duel. This is a batting duel between the two Kings of Clout.
Each one has knocked out a home run...
...but Gehrig has promised two home runs for that kid. Can he do it?
Here's $10 says he can't.
Here's $10 says he can.
Ball!
Strike!
The catcher gives the signal.
Pitcher's got the ball, here's the windup.
Strike!
Strike two.
The ball is back to the pitcher.
He takes his time.
Strike three. Gehrig's out.
Louie didn't want Babe Ruth to feel bad.
This is the sixth inning. Lou's at bat again.
After that second home run for Billy, that little boy in the hospital.
Strike!
Take it easy, Lou.
Gehrig seems to be overanxious.
He's reaching for some bad ones.
He's trying too hard for that second home run for that kid.
That was a sucker bet.
I hate to take that $10 from you.
- Do you want to make it $20?
- $20 it is.
Come on, hit it.
Gehrig takes his bat off his shoulder.
Looks at it. Maybe he thinks it has a hole.
Strike three.
Oh, gosh.
Maybe you'd better call Lou on the long distance...
...and tell him to stop fooling.
Hurry, hurry! Lay down!
Safe!
Now, remember, Lou, take it easy.
Take it easy, don't press.
All we need is a single.
You might as well kick in with the $20.
- The game isn't over yet.
- It's as good as over.
- You want to make it $30?
- It's a bet.
Here he is again.
Ball!
They're going to pass him.
That's dirty pool.
Last time at bat in this World Series and if they walk him, it will fill the bases.
That's a lot better than risking an apple over the fence.
Let him walk you, Lou.
The count's no strikes, three balls, two outs.
Here it comes.
If you haven't got $30,
I'll take your left leg on account.
What do you think of that one?
Two home runs in one World Series game.
He's really a man, that man.
From now on, they'll have to spell
Gehrig's name in capital letters.
Lou.
Gehrig.
Hey, guys, what about a half-dozen collars?
Go to it, boys.
Mr. Gehrig.
Mr. Gehrig, telegram for you.
Hey, don't tear my clothes.
Everything all right, Lou?
What's the idea?
- You live here?
- No.
What are you doing here?
I was calling on a young lady.
At 4:00 in the morning?
What for?
If you must know...
...I was calling on the young lady to ask her to marry me.
- I see. And who are you?
- My name is Lou Gehrig.
- Lou who?
- Gehrig.
You look like him, too.
I didn't recognize you in the dark.
My name's O'Doole.
Glad to know you, Gehrig.
- You're gonna ask her to marry you?
- Yeah.
Knocked out a couple of homers yesterday, didn't you?
I got a little lucky.
I hope you have good luck today, too.
Is Miss Twitchell at home?
- What's she done?
- Nothing yet.
- Tell her Lou Gehrig wants to see her.
- Yes, sir.
- Will you come in and wait in the parlor?
- Yeah. Go on in.
Thank you.
You're kinda fidgety.
Yeah.
Eleanor.
- What is it?
- A policeman wants to see you.
- A policeman?
- And a fellow called Lou Gehrig.
I guess you don't need me anymore.
Louie should be home most any minute.
I don't know what's keeping him.
Tessie, don't you see him yet?
Not yet.
I love surprise parties.
Why didn't Lou come home on the train with the team?
He missed the train. He sent us a telegram.
I bet Lou will be glad to get back home after all that hotel food.
Yes.
Tonight we have stuffed breast of veal, and tomorrow night, fried eels.
Tessie, no sign yet?
Not yet.
I don't know what's keeping him.
Papa is in there fussing with the food again.
I gave you the instructions.
You said you would tell Apfell.
You got it wrong.
You have ruined everything.
- What is it, Papa?
- This fool. This dope.
It ain't my fault. I just delivered it.
- What happened?
- Look.
They made Louie a right-handed batter.
I didn't even know what it was.
Mr. Apfell just told me to deliver it.
The only one in America that don't know Louie's a southpaw...
...and he has to be our baker.
- Maybe nobody'll notice it.
- A right-hander.
- Tessie, now?
- Not yet.
What do you think happened to the cake?
Now!
Where is everybody?
Surprise!
Mom, this is Ellie.
I mean, Eleanor Twitchell.
Hello, Mrs. Gehrig.
- And this is my pop.
- Lou, that was some ball game.
- This is Mrs. Johnson.
- How do you do?
Mrs. Martin, Mrs. Larsen, and Miss Larsen.
Well, listen, folks, there's something I've got to tell you.
I guess there's only one way to do this thing.
Mrs. Gehrig, meet Mrs. Gehrig.
- What?
- I mean, as soon as we get married.
Lou's done nothing but talk about you,
Mrs. Gehrig.
I'm so happy.
I got some refreshments in the other room.
Brought you back a ball used in the third game.
Did you?
The trouble with you, Mama, you are not modern.
A young fellow nowadays...
...he's engaged, he takes his girl back to her hotel.
It's 10 minutes to the hotel, 10 minutes back.
But it doesn't mean he gets home in 20 minutes.
By the end of next season, you can finish up in Chicago...
...come back here and get an apartment, fix it up, then we'll get married.
I think she's giving us a gentle hint.
Do you think your mother likes me?
Like you? How could she help liking you?
I was just wondering.
She ought to be jealous of you.
You're so pretty.
I'm jealous of you myself.
I guess I was wrong.
- About what?
- Nothing.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I must say, you've picked the most beautiful number in the store.
- Ellie, if you are looking for a chifforobe...
- I found it, Mom. Just what I want.
Isn't it lovely?
It don't look very practical, and it looks second-hand, too.
It's an antique.
Louie can afford to buy new stuff.
I'll show you.
Look at that.
Strong and practical. It'll last a lifetime.
- Mom, I worked out sort of a scheme.
- It was only a suggestion.
- You see, the rug in the bedroom...
- The rug.
You remind me. I'll show you.
Take a look at that.
It's exactly the right size for your living room.
I was planning on something more a pastel shade.
It's almost an exact duplicate of the first rug we had in our place.
Only more so.
That's why I bought it for you.
It's your wedding present.
I asked them to bring it up to see how it would look.
You can live with it for a while, and if you don't like it...
I can send it back.
I promise, you won't send it back, not with the scarf on it.
I just want you to let me show you how it looks.
- Will you let me, Ellie?
- Certainly.
What's that?
The bedroom paper, miss.
You've made a mistake. It's the wrong pattern.
- This is the one I selected.
- It was changed this morning.
- Who changed it?
- Isn't it beautiful?
This little rose pattern I picked out...
I guarantee you wouldn't like it if you saw it on the wall, neither would Louie.
Lou was with me when I picked it out.
He liked it.
Men like anything.
I never gave you much advice.
First, you wouldn't take it.
Second, I've been married 35 years...
...and I've learned one thing.
Well?
Can't you read between the lines what I'm saying?
It's not anything I can say in so many words...
...and yet, it's something that, if you don't handle it right...
Don't say anything about this to Mama.
About what?
It's all right.
It doesn't make that much difference.
- And if you don't like the chifforobe...
- I'll probably get used to it.
You are very sweet to admit you are wrong.
Look, the same wallpaper we had when you were a little boy.
- What's wrong with Ellie?
- Ellie? Nothing. She just left here.
- What happened? Was it about this?
- The chifforobe?
It's not what she ordered. She wanted...
It wasn't practical. Not even mahogany.
- The drawers were too small.
- But she liked it.
She liked this wallpaper, too, at first.
But I convinced her that pattern was better.
More practical.
She's very sensible.
- You are lucky to get a girl like her.
- That's right.
I just had a nice talk with your mother-in-law.
- What about?
- Lots of things.
Mostly about interior decorating, especially wallpaper and chifforobes.
You know that wallpaper you picked out for the bedroom?
I think it's wonderful.
- Your mother picked out another pattern.
- I saw it. It's terrible.
And so is that chifforobe.
- You mean, the one that just came in?
- I mean, the one that just went out.
I told them to take it back.
I'd have nightmares looking at that thing.
Lou Gehrig, I think I could learn to like you.
I hope you didn't hurt Mom's feelings.
I probably did. But she'll get over it.
She'll have to.
You can't run a baseball team with two captains or a household with two bosses.
There's only going to be one boss in this house.
You'd better get that apron off, and get your nose powdered.
Why?
I telephoned Sam Blake to get the mayor over here right away.
What for?
I thought you wanted to get married.
"...giving the ring and join hands.
"Now therefore, I, by virtue of authority reposed in me...
"I pronounce...
"I pronounce, they are man and wife."
The party is over.
We've got to get this house ready for living.
Put the bathtub in there. Thank you, sir.
Mr. Blake, you better arrange right away for a leave of absence for Louie.
- Leave of absence? What for?
- Your wedding trip.
Atlantic City would be a good place.
Excuse me.
I haven't missed a game since I joined, and I'm not going to now.
If he does, I'll get a divorce.
You mean you are not going to have a honeymoon?
Of course. The Yankee Stadium.
We'd better go if Ellie wants to stop to change her dress.
Holy Mackerel, I'll miss batting practice.
Pull over.
Fifty miles an hour on a thoroughfare.
Fifty-five to be exact, Officer.
I know it's terrible but...
...it'll be terrible if we don't get to the Yankee Stadium in 15 minutes.
It'll be terrible if you don't get there for the start of the game.
It will be terrible if Lou Gehrig doesn't get there for the start of the game.
You know he hasn't missed a game since he joined the Yankees.
Who'd you say?
Lou Gehrig.
- Hello, Mr. Gehrig.
- Hi, officers.
- This is Mrs. Gehrig.
- How do you do?
This is our 10th wedding anniversary.
We've been married 10 minutes.
- You just got married.
- What do you know about that?
Pardon me, but the game starts in exactly 14 minutes.
What are we waiting for?
Do you want to get pinched for holding up traffic?
- Who you got there, Joe?
- Lou Gehrig.
He's late for the game.
It's Lou Gehrig. Come on.
That's the way to go in there.
What are you doing, Lou?
Knocking the rice off of your spikes?
All right, pitch to me, now.
That was a thank you for marrying me.
- What?
- That was a thank you for marrying me.
What?
He says that was thank you for marrying him, and we thank you, too.
You're welcome.
Not so bad for a guy who nobody was going to remember.
- One more kissing the bride.
- Okay.
That's terrific. Hold it.
Thank you, Mr. Gehrig.
What about the one where the bride kisses the groom?
Yeah.
I never knew you were such a hound for publicity.
Publicity? I don't even care if there's no film in their cameras.
All right, here we go.
Hold it.
Okay.
A girl's got to breathe.
- The best of luck to you, Lou.
- Thanks, Babe.
You'll get a great play on these pictures.
The day that Lou won all three American championships.
Batting average, home runs...
He's got it wrong. This is the day I got married.
- Come on, let's get this.
- That's a good one.
You've got to forgive me. I was held up.
The boss had a brainstorm.
He gabbled for two hours.
Finally I said,
"Look, Boss, this is Lou Gehrig's birthday.
"I'm master of ceremonies, so good-bye."
How are you anyway?
- I suppose Lou is sore at me?
- I wouldn't know.
What's going on here? Where is Lou?
I was hoping he was with you.
With me? Did he say...
I did see him after the game, he...
What time was that?
It was kinda late.
You see, we hung around for a while.
What did he say when he telephoned?
He didn't telephone.
He was probably detained somewhere.
Maybe something important.
No doubt.
Now, don't be like that.
You don't know how lucky you are.
Most women, when their husband's late, have to worry.
They're either drunk or run into a dame or something.
But you and Lou, why, all you've got to do is sit pretty and smile.
I'll bet this is the first time he's late since he's been married.
This is the fourth time, Sam.
That's nothing. Four times in 10 weeks.
That's perfectly understandable.
Have you tried calling up anywhere?
I don't have to call up. I know where he is.
Don't talk like that.
You know Lou is true-blue.
- That's what you think.
- Don't get hysterical.
- Things like this happen all the...
- I'm not hysterical.
I'm perfectly controlled.
I've just learned to face the facts.
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to get him.
- You can't do that.
- Yes, I can.
I tell you, you're wrong.
There's some explanation that doesn't appear on the surface.
- You know where he is?
- Yes.
- You sure?
- Yes.
- How'd you find out?
- I caught him.
I don't believe it. I can't believe it.
You got to go back.
You can't walk in on him like this.
Yes, I can.
You can't make a scandal.
Think of the fans and how they'll feel.
I can't, I'm too selfish.
It almost kills my faith in human nature.
Lou Gehrig.
A guy with a wife like you.
Pal or no pal...
...I'm going to take a baseball bat and bust his skull wide open.
I'm gonna make him wish he was never born.
I'm gonna hound that guy for the rest of his life.
Strike three. You're out.
Well, of all the dirty, low-down tricks...
You almost made me have a nervous breakdown.
- What's the score, Lou?
- 23 to 22, end of the ninth.
Three men on bases.
He'll be right along now.
Don't talk to me, you Borgia.
Dad was right.
He knew a ballplayer when he saw one.
When you said that, the Chicago Rathskeller jumped right up in my lap.
- That wasn't yesterday, was it, Tanglefoot?
- No.
I sure didn't know what I was walking into that day.
"Mr. Gehrig, meet Miss Twitchell."
And I left my little world behind me.
Your world? What do you mean?
Baseball life is so different.
Sort of a little world all by itself.
You play it in the spring, summer, and fall, and talk about it in the winter.
- You really eat, drink, and sleep it.
- Yes, you have had a dish of it.
- Here it is, spring again.
- Some spring.
Spring for a ballplayer. Florida next week again.
Look, how's this?
These spring training trips must be kind of dull for a girl.
How about you passing up
Florida this spring?
Take a little vacation for yourself.
All right.
It's been a long time since you've palled around with the team.
Give you a little vacation, too.
- We have seen a lot of each other.
- Yes, it's an idea.
Yes, it is.
- You don't want to stay here, do you?
- You don't want to go without me, do you?
The winner.
You just handed me my next story on a silver platter.
- How I Beat My Wife by Lou Gehrig.
- Nix.
- It's a piparoo.
- Over my dead body.
- It'll kill 'em.
- Lay off our private life.
- Then, what'll I write about?
- About half a column.
If I was in the Sahara Desert, dying of thirst, you'd bring me vinegar.
I'll see you at the ballpark.
Hey.
That's dirty pool.
Why didn't you want Sam to write about your private life?
Because that's something that belongs to just the two of us.
It's been a pretty good, little old private life at that, hasn't it?
Even though we never had a honeymoon?
We've never had anything else.
Hey. What's the idea?
You want a bust in the nose?
Just trying to clean up some of that poison pen stuff of yours.
Look at that,
"Gehrig's accidental home run yesterday."
- I'm writing what Babe thinks.
- You don't need paper for that.
You can write all the Babe ever thought on a piece of confetti.
That was pretty brainy, I suppose, having Gehrig call Ruth "the Ex-King of Swat."
That's facts. Gehrig's writing facts.
Ruth will show you some facts in his column tomorrow.
Any facts Ruth dreams up will be topped by Lou Gehrig...
...without borrowing your opium pipe.
Come in.
- These just came, Mrs. Gehrig.
- Thank you.
Just like the kind Mom used to try to make.
It's Mom's recipe, as if you didn't know it.
Anybody home?
- Hello, Ellie. Hello, Lou.
- Hello, Pop.
- Hello, Lou.
- Mom.
- Eating breakfast?
- Lou's been raving about your recipe, Mom.
Don't let him eat too many, he'll get fat.
What if I do? Then I can quit baseball.
- What?
- Quit baseball? Louie, are you crazy?
I've always had a hankering to go in for engineering, you know that.
Engineering.
The best ballplayer in the world would waste his time like that.
- Lou always told me his Uncle Otto...
- Uncle Otto, Schmotto.
Digging ditches, that's all he ever did.
The world is full of Ottos.
But how many Lou Gehrigs are there?
Look at him, eating flapjacks on the most important day of his life.
Important?
Don't tell me you have forgotten what day this is?
My birthday? No.
- Ellie, I haven't forgotten?
- No. It's not my birthday, either.
Or Mom's or Pop's.
- It's not our wedding anniversary.
- I'm surprised at you, Ellie.
Today is the day Lou Gehrig is playing his 2,000th consecutive baseball game.
- So what?
- What?
Look at him. Pretending he don't care.
I've got an idea.
What do you say you miss today's game?
You've gone crazy maybe.
No, don't you see?
It's no news when Lou's in the lineup, the real news is if he misses a game.
- Man bites dog.
- That's right.
Stop joking and come on, get a wiggle on you.
The ballpark will be crowded, and the fans will give you an automobile.
Why an automobile?
Maybe they will give him a yacht.
An automobile or a yacht, or the Statue of Liberty. I'd better go.
All right, if that's the way you feel about it.
But I warn you, all you'll get is a horseshoe of roses.
Don't be so cynical.
- "Good luck, Lou Gehrig," on a ribbon.
- You don't appreciate Lou's importance.
- They'll give him an automobile at least.
- I say a yacht.
You don't appreciate my importance.
I'm going to get an automobile or a yacht.
If you insist, but you'll come home with a horseshoe of roses!
Safe!
Why don't he bunt?
What's the matter with him?
- Three runs behind, and you want to bunt.
- The unexpected, Mom.
- Get onto yourself!
- He should wait him out.
The pitcher has been missing the corners since the sixth inning.
If that's true, why don't you tell McCarthy how to run his job?
Shut up.
McCarthy is going great today.
He has pulled three boners I know of.
How would you like to shut up yourself?
Say, why don't you both shut up?
Strike three. You're out!
What, no automobile?
No yacht?
I was lucky to get away with my life.
I struck out three times.
The last time, in the ninth, with the bases full.
If I had my way, darling,
I'd give you the Yankee Stadium.
I wanted to knock a home run for you today, but maybe I tried too hard.
"Good luck, Lou Gehrig."
If they only knew what I know.
If they only realized what lies back of those 2,000 games you've played.
This is for the time in Chicago you got beaned and went on playing.
This for having brown eyes!
That's for when you played 12 innings in St. Louis with a broken toe.
Here's for being the greatest fan a man ever had.
That's for when you had 103 fever and played a double-header.
Here's for sitting up all night and curing me.
Here's for when you had the flu and wouldn't quit.
Here's for not letting me quit.
This is for all the times you've had broken fingers and not told me about it.
Here's for putting up with me all these years!
I've won fair and square. Don't try to pretend...
What is it?
I must have sprained my shoulder or something.
It felt kind of stiff at the game.
Maybe that's why I struck out.
I'll get the liniment.
That's the one, there.
Here we go.
On the hustle. Come on, babe.
That's the one.
Those kids don't know what to do with their speed.
- Lucky you got out of the way so quick.
- Yeah.
Bill.
What's the matter with Lou?
You're out.
I certainly came down here like an old ice wagon.
- That should have been a hit, easy.
- They can't all be hits.
I tell you, maybe you're trying too hard.
You can't try too hard.
Why don't you hit the shower, and take the rest of the day off?
No. I need a lot of work.
The old man made it, six times around.
It's worse than being a golf widow, waiting for your husband to run around a park.
I'm sorry to be so long.
- So, I'm slowing up?
- Sure.
I'll get a wheelchair and push you around.
What an exhibition. You call that baseball?
Gehrig booted the game.
Threw it down the drain.
That's a batting champion for you.
- Did you see him swing like an old lady?
- It's criminal.
They ought to give you your money back.
That game was just booted away.
I got better support than that in the bush leagues.
Shut up.
I can't pitch and play first base, too.
That old man on first ought to have some crutches to get around with.
What goes on here?
Just talked out of turn.
Save the fight for the field, boys.
You watch, Gehrig will come back.
He always does.
Every ballplayer has a slump eventually, but in this case, it isn't just a slump.
It's obviously a breakdown.
- That's a lie.
- A dirty lie.
No, sir, he ain't through.
I tell you, Mr. Gehrig can't be through.
Gehrig'll come back.
He's made of iron. You wait and see.
15 years, then all of a sudden, he goes sour.
What's the answer?
Gehrig must be having trouble with his teeth.
Get back.
Strike two.
Strike three.
Joe.
You'd better send someone in for me.
I can't make it anymore.
You sure you want it that way?
Yup.
Dahlgren, get in there at first.
- Good luck.
- Thanks.
Your attention, please!
Dahlgren...
... now playing first base for New York...
... replacing Gehrig.
2,130 games.
14 years.
Play ball!
It's a routine, I'm telling you.
In a place like this, they give you the x-ray...
...the cardiograph, the metabolism, the fluoroscope, the works.
Then they're liable to tell you got dandruff.
It's happened time and again.
A friend came here...
Got any chewing gum, Sam?
Had a talk with the doctor the other day.
He said he never ran up against a better physical specimen.
Strong as an ox, he said you were.
Talked to the x-ray guy, too.
What a send-off he gave you.
Heart okay, lungs okay, everything okay.
I'll bet you...
Here's the doc.
How did I do, Doctor?
I'm afraid you'll have to give up baseball for a while.
- You see, Mr. Gehrig...
- Go ahead, Doc.
I'm a man who likes to know his batting average.
I've only made a superficial examination of the tests.
We shall need some new x-rays.
Give it to me straight, Doc.
Am I through with baseball?
I'm afraid so.
Any worse than that?
You heard what the doc said.
He's got to go over the tests again.
Is it three strikes, Doc?
You want it straight?
Sure I do, straight.
It's three strikes.
Doc, I've learned one thing.
All the arguing in the world can't change the decision of the umpire.
How much time have I got?
Pardon me.
- Yes?
- Mrs. Gehrig is waiting.
Have her come up, please.
I don't want Mrs. Gehrig to know, ever.
I understand.
- But the newspapers...
- Sam here can take care of that.
- Can't you, Sam?
- Sure. I will.
Leave it to me. I'll cook up something...
Hi, Ellie.
Darling, the verdict's in.
I'm not such a bad ballplayer.
I've really got something, haven't I?
What is it?
I'd be cured by the time
I could learn to pronounce it.
- Can you pronounce it, Doctor?
- We really haven't concluded all our tests.
Excuse me.
- Yes?
- X-ray room is ready, Doctor.
Thank you.
Just one more picture, Mr. Gehrig.
Just one more for the record, Doc?
Right back, Ellie.
You'll never get all the pictures of Lou into that scrapbook.
You'd think he was a glamour boy.
What did the doctor tell Lou?
Nothing. Nothing at all.
Some little thing with a long name.
Some kind of an "itis," I don't know.
He'll have to lay off for a while. So what?
He'll be back next season, or the season after.
Tell me the truth, Sam.
I am telling the truth, honest.
I'd swear on a stack of Bibles.
You heard what the doctor said.
When is Lou going to die?
- Who told you?
- Nobody had to tell me.
I could read it in your eyes.
All of you.
It's all right, Sam.
I'll never let him know I know.
He's so young yet, so strong, and...
Ladies and gentlemen.
Lemonade, peanuts, and popcorn.
Given away free today in honor of the great Lou Gehrig.
Bulletin.
Gehrig Day not a farewell but a come-on.
A ballyhoo to get more money out of the Yanks...
...when Gehrig comes back to the game next season.
Know what? We're gonna knock 'em dead when we come back.
Do you think we can get $50,000 out of those tightwads?
Not a cent under $100,000.
It stands to reason, you'll be twice as good after you've had a rest.
You know...
...we've never had a honeymoon.
Why shouldn't we have one now?
Sure. Better late than never.
What about Niagara Falls?
Sure. Then we could go up to northern Canada and go fishing.
I've been thinking maybe we could take a trip around the world.
All the things we've never had time for before.
We've all the time in the world now, haven't we?
We've got all the time in the world now.
You're a scream in that moustache.
What's that?
Take it out and see.
Open it.
I had that made up of some of the hardware I've collected.
Like it?
I adore it.
I remember when you got every one of these medals.
That's the one I got the most kick out of.
The batting championship I won the year we were married.
Here, Ellie.
I've got a right to cry a little.
It's such a beautiful thing.
I wanted you to have it...
...because you've given me so much.
You've been so...
- Are you making love to me, you big ape?
- You bet I am, you dope.
Gehrig Day program.
It's Lou Gehrig.
Look. There's Lou Gehrig.
Right this way, Mr. Gehrig. Give him room.
- Stand back.
- Hello, Lou, old boy.
- When are you coming back, Lou?
- We sure miss you.
Mr. Gehrig, please.
Don't you remember me?
You knocked out two home runs for me one afternoon.
Sure. I remember you.
- How are you?
- Just great.
I've been waiting here all afternoon because I had to tell you something.
I just got in town today, and I had to tell you.
I did what you said.
I tried hard, and I made it.
Look, I can walk.
That's great work, kid.
That's wonderful.
- Have you got a ticket for the game?
- Yes, sir, you bet.
- So long.
- So long.
62,000 people have jammed the Yankee Stadium...
...to pay tribute to a man who, for 16 years, has given everything that's in him.
Never in baseball has there been such a spontaneous demonstration...
...of love and affection for one man.
He's known as "Larruping Lou" and "The Iron Horse."
No matter what, he'll never be forgotten.
Nor will his great records.
They'll never forget his greatest record.
His amazing feat of playing
2,130 consecutive ball games...
... over a period of 16 years.
Everyone is here to show him just what they feel in their hearts.
To say hail and farewell to the pride of the Yankees.
The emotion on all sides is tremendous.
Around home plate, all the celebrities standing there.
The beginning of the ceremonies,
Joe McCarthy comes forward.
Hands Lou Gehrig a plaque.
On that plaque are two words. "Don't quit."
Nothing in Gehrig's nature was the quitter type.
McCarthy puts it down, turns around, receives a trophy and in turn...
... gives that trophy to Lou Gehrig.
The trophy is a trophy from the Yankees, the teammates of Gehrig.
Here comes the mayor of New York City.
Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia.
LaGuardia addresses a few words, perhaps what Gehrig has meant to this city.
LaGuardia turns around, extends his hand, and shakes hands with Lou.
Gehrig visibly impressed with all this demonstration of affection.
Postmaster General of the United States,
Jim Farley.
Farley shakes Gehrig's hand,
Gehrig again trying to manage a smile.
Now, Babe Ruth, the Sultan of Swat.
Babe talks into the microphone.
Praise from the man who preceded
Lou Gehrig in the batting order.
Babe walks over and puts his arms around Gehrig's shoulders.
Here they are.
The heart of the Murderer's Row of the Yankees.
Gehrig with his eyes down.
Manager Joe McCarthy addresses some remarks, drawing applause from the boys.
McCarthy walks over to Gehrig, puts his hand affectionately on his shoulder...
... starts leading Lou Gehrig over to a whole galaxy of microphones.
He'll be saying a few words.
This whole crowd in the stadium hopes so.
Gehrig stands at the microphones, visibly impressed, all choked up.
Listen to that crowd!
I have been walking on ball fields for 16 years...
... and I've never received anything but...
... kindness and encouragement...
... from you fans.
I have had the great honor...
... to have played...
... with these great veteran ballplayers on my left...
... Murderer's Row...
... our championship team of 1927.
I have had the further honor of living with...
... and playing with these men on my right...
... the Bronx Bombers, the Yankees of today.
I have been given...
... fame and undeserved praise...
... by the boys up there behind the wire in the press box...
... my friends, the sportswriters.
I have worked under the two greatest managers of all time...
... Miller Huggins and Joe McCarthy.
I have a mother and father...
... who fought to give me health...
... and a solid background in my youth.
I have a wife...
... a companion for life...
... who has shown me more courage than I ever knew.
People all say that I've had a bad break...
... but today...
Today I consider myself...
... the luckiest man on the face of the earth.
Play ball!
This is the town of Huxton...
... not an important place like New York or Chicago.
Just a small town.
There's never very much excitement in Huxton...
... except for a dance at the firehouse or a wedding.
But a few days ago, December 7th, there was plenty of excitement.
That day, Charlie Beaugart, the barber, was so excited...
... he nicked 3 chins and one Adam's apple.
This little fellow just got shaved.
His name is Middling, Eustace Middling.
He's a newcomer to Huxton.
Only been in town a few days.
Now, here's an old-timer.
Hello, Captain Biddle.
Principal of the high school.
Kicked me out of school once.
Had it coming, though.
That's the town paper.
Fellow at the desk is the editor,
Dan Madison, busiest man in town.
Just been appointed head of Civilian Defense for Huxton.
There's Peggy Parker.
She's Dan's star reporter.
Now, don't get any funny notions.
They're engaged.
Everybody likes Peggy.
On the other hand, there's J.P. Norton, president of the bank.
He'd lend you money on most anything, except his wife.
Why should he be left holding the bag?
Good morning, Mr. Norton.
And a good morning to you, Mrs. Norton.
They're a very happy couple.
J.P. worships the ground her grandfather discovered oil on.
And speaking of couples, come on over here.
Went to school with these boys long before they became successful.
Come to think of it,
I did hear they went into another business.
Oh, yeah. Pet shop.
They ought to do well in this business.
Moved again.
Must be the Gypsy in them.
Excuse me, could you tell me where I could find Laurel and Hardy?
Thank you kindly.
Well, we caught up with them at last.
Funny, locking up in the middle of the day.
First volunteers out of Huxton.
Going off to the city to enlist.
And they won't take no for an answer.
Take a look at them, Uncle Sam.
What do you think?
- No.
- And then...
... could we please be sailors?
No!
- And finally, maybe we could be Marines?
- No!
But did that discourage them?
It certainly did.
Look at that.
I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Norton.
Oh, it's you. I might have known.
It couldn't be that you've come back...
...to town to pay your debts.
- Why, we'd be glad to...
...if you'd allow us to negotiate a slight loan.
A loan?
You two blundering failures.
More money from me for your stupid, inefficient bungling.
And another thing...
Good day.
- Hello, boys.
- Hello, Peggy.
Well, hello, fellas.
I thought you'd gone to enlist.
- Uncle Sam didn't want us.
- Oh, that's too bad. Better luck next time.
Poor guys. They feel terrible.
Yeah, it's a tough break.
Dan, why don't you let them help us?
Say, that's an idea. Hey, boys!
Come here.
Look, fellas,
Uncle Sam wants everybody.
There's plenty to be done right here on the home front. Why, I have a job for you.
- Here, paste up these posters.
- Where?
Everywhere. We're having a big meeting tonight in the high school gym.
- What for?
- The war effort.
That's right. There's a job to be done right here at home.
- Come on, Stanley. We'll fix it.
- Sure.
How do you do?
- What's going on here?
- Bicycle shop moving out.
Radio shop moving in.
Why?
Why...
Just a minute, my good man.
You can't do this.
I would like to see somebody stop me.
Oh, no, you don't. Oh, no, you don't!
You can't take this bicycle, sir.
This is our property, and you will not...
- It's our bike.
- You can't interfere...
- Give it to me, sir. No, sir.
- I'll call the authority.
You can't do it. You...
Oh, you big...!
Gentlemen.
- Why, this is outrageous.
- Well...
What are you doing in my shop?
- Your shop?
- Yes.
- It's our shop.
- It certainly is.
And we have Mr. Norton's dispossess notice to prove it.
Why, I just signed the lease for this place.
They told me the former occupants are now in the Army.
They were among the first to volunteer.
Brave gentlemen. I salute them, sirs.
He's talking about us.
- That's right. Pardon me, sir.
- Yes?
I'm Mr. Hardy and this is my partner, Mr. Laurel.
- And we are not in the Army.
- Yes.
No. And we want our store back.
Oh, well, now, that's different.
Now, let me think.
- Yes.
- Let me think. Let me think.
Let him think.
Let me see, l...
I sell radios, you sell bicycles.
I don't really need all this space.
And in times like these, we must all pull together.
- Why don't we share the store?
- It's a deal.
Bicycles, burglar alarms, locks and keys...
- And radios.
- That's right, sir.
- We welcome you to the firm.
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, Ollie.
Thank you.
But right now, we have some work to do for Uncle Sam.
Come, Stanley.
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.
And as for you, when I return...
...l'd like to see every one of those bicycles back in this shop...
...in their proper place.
I'll see you at the back door.
Hello, Heydrich?
Well, I've occupied the shop.
- And I have a couple of partners.
- Partners?
Your orders were to establish yourself as a patriotic, respectable American.
You can't have partners on this assignment.
Don't get so excited.
Wait till you see them.
They're a wonderful front.
We'll go down the street.
We'll put them on both sides...
...so that they can see them coming and going.
Yeah.
Are you putting that one on upside down?
Look at my dress.
You've ruined my new dress!
It wasn't me, lady. It was him.
What are you supposed to be doing, anyway?
We're putting up bills, you see, for the gym...
- Oh, the idea.
- Excuse me. Maybe I can help your dress.
Thank you! Good day!
We're all here because we want to be here.
We're here as volunteers...
...as men and women who come of our own free wills...
...to do what we can to protect the things we all hold dear.
The new magnesium plant being built here at the edge of town...
...goes into operation in the next two months...
...supplying a vital war product.
Now, the enemy will wanna stop this supply.
This makes Huxton a defense area...
...just the same as if we were on the fighting front.
And we've gotta protect not only the plant, but the homes and lives of its workers.
Now, the first thing we have to do is get organized.
So I would now like to announce the appointments...
...of the heads of our various units.
First, as Chief of the
Air Raid Warden Service, Captain Biddle.
Will you come on?
We're 20 minutes late now.
You can't take that dog in here.
I didn't ask him to come in.
I just gave him a piece of popcorn.
- That was all...
- Well, put that stuff away. Go on, dog.
- Go on. Get out. Go home.
- You can't come in here, see?
- I'll see you when we come out.
- Yeah.
- Go on home.
- Go get it, now. Go get it.
As leader of the Women's Auxiliary...
...I appoint Mrs. J.P. Norton.
Thank you.
My friends, thank you.
I shall devote myself to the trust that you all have placed in me.
I am now serving as president of the Women's Club...
...and have many social duties as wife of the city's leading banker.
- Take your shoes off.
- However, this new work is important too.
I can't. I got a hole in my sock.
Take them off.
And I shall try to knit a well-formed organization.
Thus, I bring to the task not only my enthusiasm...
...but my experience in leadership.
For leadership, as I've often told our ladies, is all-important.
With strong leaders, we succeed.
With weak leaders, we fail.
I can assure you that, under my leadership, the ladies of Huxton will succeed.
As I was saying...
...there is one pitfall which we ladies must avoid.
We must be sure that we choose the right people for the right jobs.
- It's my rheumatism.
- Just as Mr. Madison...
...has exercised great care in the selection of his coworkers...
...so must I pick my assistants.
Each of our activities must be headed by a lady...
...who will imbue her workers with a spirit of self-sacrifice.
Only in this way...
...can our organization become a credit to our fair city.
We must have...
As I was saying...
About...
About my coworkers, the very first thing I shall do tomorrow...
...is to set up a suggestion box at our headquarters...
...where any lady can submit her ideas.
No doubt, we shall have hundreds of ideas to select from.
Of course, it will be impossible to put every one of them into execution.
I shall choose all those that are worthy.
And that...
And that...
I shall speak to the ladies when we have our own meeting.
Thank you, Mrs. Norton.
Now, there isn't very much more I can say except to thank you for your interest.
And before we close the meeting, are there any questions?
- Mr. Madison.
- Mr. Norton?
I have a little to add to what has been said.
This service should be run with the strictest efficiency.
Perfection is the key to success.
Without it, you are locked in the chamber of failure.
As president of the Huxton Savings Bank...
...I am often called upon for advice and counsel...
...in forming new organizations.
As a boy...
Perfection.
From this, I have built my career.
Take this as your foundation and nothing can ever upset you.
There have been several questions about equipment.
Now, for the time being, we'll have to get along with these homemade armbands.
Regulation equipment has been promised us soon...
...but until it arrives,
I can only ask your patience.
Now, tonight we're going to have a little practical experience in first aid.
You're going to be sent out in teams to various places where you'll find victims.
Other wardens have volunteered to act as these victims.
All right, captain, you can give the men their instructions.
That's a good idea.
You will render first aid, and then, if necessary, call an ambulance...
...from the nearest emergency dressing station.
Listen.
Now, let's make a perfect showing...
...and put into practice all we've learned in these lectures. Any questions?
- No.
- Okay. Get going.
Do you think we were wise giving Laurel and Hardy a job like this?
Don't worry.
I sent them down to Fifth and Elm.
The policeman on the corner has a sliver in his finger.
"Splinter in the finger."
Let's see that slip.
Well, that's what it says,
"Report to policeman at Fifth and Elm."
Okay, boys. Get going.
111 Main Street.
Hey! You can't go in there.
That place is a blazing inferno of flames and smoke...
...where one false step might mean sudden death!
It says here.
- Well, what do we do if it's burning...?
- We'll crawl in.
- How are we gonna crawl in...?
- Get down on your knees and quit arguing.
Get down.
- How do you do, Mr. Norton?
- Careful, Mr. Norton. This place is on fire.
- Yeah. We've come to rescue you.
- That's just what I was afraid of.
- All right. Let's get started, boys.
- Yes, sir.
"Fractured right arm, fractured right leg, possible jaw fracture, burns on the face."
- You'd better lie down, Mr. Norton. Yes.
- Yeah, then we'll fix you up right away.
Gentlemen, I want to cooperate...
...but are you sure this is the place you were sent to?
Oh, why, certainly.
I've got our orders right on a piece of paper.
- Show them to him, Ollie.
- Just a second.
- We wouldn't come here without orders.
- No, sir.
- We certainly...
- I've lost it.
Well, you'd better call headquarters to be sure.
- Pardon us, Mr. Norton. Come, Stanley.
- Yeah. We'll be right back.
Look, he changed his mind.
I thought he would.
- Thanks for cooperating, Mr. Norton.
- That's the spirit.
Get me that plank.
Why don't you watch what you're doing?
Put that plank down.
Now...
Roll him over.
Easy, now. Easy. Easy. That's it.
Now, let's see. Fractured back.
Raise that plank.
- How do you feel?
- I feel swell.
- Good.
- Just...
Not you!
How do you feel, Mr. Norton?
You better ask him. He's mad at me.
How do you feel, Mr. Norton?
He's mad at me, too.
- What will we do now?
- Let's see.
"Burns on the face." Get some grease.
- I haven't got any grease...
- Well, look for some!
- What kind of grease?
- Oh, any kind!
- Grease.
- Put it on the face.
Not mine, his!
It's all right, Mr. Norton.
It won't be long now.
Everything is just fine.
Now, that's fine, Stanley.
- Give me a hand, now.
- Yes, sir.
Help me lift it up.
All right. One, two, three.
We'll simplify this.
Now, when I lift him up, slide the dolly under him.
That's it. Now, we'll push him.
Hey, get me something to wipe my hands.
- Get me out of here!
- Yes, sir.
- Get me out of here!
- Come on, Stanley.
We're doing our best, Mr. Norton, we...
He's stuck. What are we going to do?
What about...?
Pull the truck up, and I'll hold him.
Hurry up!
Don't worry, Mr. Norton.
Now, we'll have you out in a jiffy.
- Get me out of here.
- It's okay, sir. Everything will be fine, now.
- Where am I?
- Hurry up, Stanley.
- Millicent, hurry up. l... I'm freezing.
- Yes, yes, dear. I'm coming.
Here, poor darling.
This will make you nice and comfy.
Look out. That's where the truck hit me.
Take this thing away.
- Yes?
- Mr. Madison is here.
- Show him in.
- Hello, Dan.
I just missed you at the dressing station.
You all right?
I will be. I hope.
What I don't understand is why a man in Mr. Norton's position...
...had to be their victim.
- It seems to me that they could...
- Millicent, please.
I volunteered to be a victim.
I certainly never thought
I'd fall in the hands of those idiots.
I'd rather fight Japs barehanded.
There was a mistake, somewhere.
You were supposed to be
Hawley and Ryan's victim. I'm terribly sorry.
You should be.
Madison, you've got to get rid of those misfits.
I just talked to them, Mr. Norton. They're...
They're awfully broken up about this.
- I'm sure it was an accident.
- They're both accidents.
With those men, we can never achieve perfection.
Oh, yes, we will.
We're getting better all the time.
- We won't make the same mistakes twice.
- I hope not.
Look, Mr. Norton, why are you doing this work?
Why? Why?
- To serve my country.
- Well, that's their idea, too.
You wouldn't deny them that, would you?
Well...
They deserve another chance, don't you think?
Oh, all right.
Fine. A good night's sleep will cool you off.
Good night, Mrs. Norton.
- Good night, Dan.
- Cool me off? Cool me off?
We're going over to the meeting and get our equipment.
- Are you coming, Mr. Middling?
- I'll be over in a little while.
Okay.
- We're going to get helmets and everything?
- That's what he said.
- Gee. And gas masks?
- That's right.
- And "whist-les?"
- Of course, "whit-sells."
One helmet.
One new armband, one gas mask, and one whistle.
Be sure to sign a receipt for your equipment, men.
Come on, boys, boys.
Not an "X." Sign your name.
Take that thing off.
And get that whistle out of your mouth.
Now, go to sleep.
Take that off!
Now, will you go to sleep, please?
See who that is.
- Well, who was it?
- It was the telephone.
Teleph...?
Laurel and Hardy.
Bicycles, burglar alarms, locks and keys.
Biddle calling. Blue alert. Proceed to your post. Stand by for the red.
We're on our way!
Good gracious.
Blue alert! Come on, get dressed.
We've got to get right on duty, right away.
Oh, put that whistle down and get dressed.
Red alert.
Red alert.
- Sound the all-clear.
- Yes, sir.
Not the whistle. Ring the bell.
Well, if it isn't the boys from the bicycle shop.
And what are you looking for?
- Trouble, I hope.
- Oh, no, no. No trouble.
Will you please put your lights out, sir?
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- He was very nice, wasn't he?
- Yes, well, that's that.
If you don't stop ringing that bell...
...l'm gonna throw him in your face!
Nevertheless, sir, I must insist that you turn your lights off.
And if not, would you mind pulling down your shades?
Would you like to pull them down for me?
Oh, I'd be glad to.
It'd be quite a pleasure, sir.
People across the street are signaling to the Japs!
Right away.
No, give it...
Go on.
Not here.
We received a complaint.
Take a look under that cover.
A couple of mugs come in here and tried to wreck the joint.
Smells like a gin mill.
Drunk.
All right, Peggy, you can send them in.
Wait a minute.
Those boys told you they never took a drink in their whole lives.
And I'm not going to sit here and watch you crucify them.
Just a moment, Miss Parker.
They've had their hearing...
...and the verdict is conclusive.
- Oh, but Dan, you can't throw them out.
I'm sorry, Peggy, but I have no choice.
Well, you'll have to do it without me.
They want you inside, boys.
Boys, l... I hate to do this...
...but I'll have to ask you to turn in your equipment.
Now, Mr. Madison, surely you don't believe we were drunk last night.
I'm sorry. The decision has been made.
It's for the good of the service.
You mean, they're better without us?
You men have caused nothing but trouble.
First, you wrecked the gymnasium.
Then you wrecked me.
And now, drunk.
Well, you know best.
But when we...
We couldn't get in the Army or the Navy...
...Mr. Madison told us that we could do this kind of work.
And it made us happy. We tried hard.
I guess we're not smart like other people...
...but if we can do something for our country...
...by not doing this work...
...we'll do that too.
We'll do anything that Uncle Sam wants us to do.
Won't we, Ollie?
Thank you, boys, that's...
Take your equipment to Charlie Beaugart.
Two helmets.
Two gas masks.
Two armbands.
Two identification cards.
And two whistles.
That's all, boys.
May I have your attention, men.
I have an important announcement to make.
Tomorrow afternoon, Major Scanlon...
...of the United States
Office of Civilian Defense...
...will stop over in Huxton to inspect our organization.
Therefore, in order to give him a demonstration of our efficiency...
...we're going to stage an incident drill for him.
Now, we'll include all possible kinds of disasters.
Incendiary bombs, demolition bombs, and gas bombs.
Which will naturally result in casualties, fires, broken water mains, and so forth.
Just as in an actual wartime emergency.
Now, in addition...
...promptly at 5:00...
...Major Scanlon will give us a surprise incident.
Now, none of us will know what this incident is...
...except the one man who will assist the major.
How about you, Mr. Norton?
- Will you take that assignment?
- With pleasure, Madison.
Okay, Mr. Norton,
5:00 tomorrow afternoon.
And remember, until then, not a word to anybody.
Now, this is our chance, men.
Are we going to make good?
Yes, sir!
- Ollie.
- What, Stanley?
Let's go to the park and feed the birds.
Better than sitting in this alley.
I don't feel like seeing any birds today. Do you?
Would you like me to read you the funnies?
Maybe that would make you feel better.
I'll go get them.
Ollie, burglars.
- I don't want any.
- Don't want?
Burglars?
Stanley, I think they are spies.
Maybe we better tell Dan Madison.
We'll tell him about...
No one would believe us.
We better make sure.
We'll follow them, come on.
- Got a cigarette?
- No, we better get some.
Let's hide in the back of their car.
- Hello, major. Dan.
- Hello.
Mr. and Mrs. Norton, Major Scanlon.
- Major Scanlon.
- How do you do?
- Glad to meet you, sir. Welcome to Huxton.
- Thank you, sir.
I'll be back in time to take you to the control center.
- Thanks, I'll be ready.
- All right. Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Dan.
- Dan?
Now, Mr. Norton,
I'd like you to check this incident...
...from the viewpoint of your local facilities.
Oh, well, you see, l...
I worked out a little incident of my own.
I thought at least you might like to consider it.
J.P.'s been working on it all day.
All right. Where is it?
Mr. Norton's like a little boy.
Lets his imagination run away with him.
Well, I'll leave you men to your military secrets.
Why, this is fine, Mr. Norton.
Just as good as mine.
Needs a few corrections, but we'll use it.
This is a job for the detectives.
Maybe we should turn it over to the FHA.
Yeah.
This must be the "hide in."
Hideout. Come on.
If we can get through that window, we can find out what they're up to.
Hey.
No, I don't...
Don't.
What was that? I heard a noise.
Shutter slammed, I guess.
Gesundheit.
I didn't sneeze.
- Well, somebody did.
- Gentlemen.
You all know Herr Mittlehause.
"Mittlehause"?
- Why, that's Middling. He's a spy.
- For two months we've been trying...
...to work out a plan to destroy the new magnesium plant.
And, gentlemen, our two months have not been in vain.
Herr Mittlehause has given me the information that makes it all possible.
Listen carefully, at 5:00 this afternoon...
...or in exactly 43 minutes...
...the civilian defenders of Huxton will take part in a practice war incident.
And while they are doing that, we will give them a real incident.
- We will blow the magnesium plant to bits.
- The moment is made to order for us.
Sunday, no construction workers at the plant...
...and everyone in town engaged playing war elsewhere.
You've done a good job, Herr Mittlehause.
You will hear from us soon.
Now, go on back to Huxton and go about your business.
Gentlemen, are we ready?
- What do we do?
- We've got to stop those guys.
- We'll warn Dan.
- That's a good idea.
No, no, no. Out the window.
Now, how are we gonna get word to Dan?
Let's call him up.
We'll tell him right away we're going to...
Put that down, that's a radio.
- What's this for?
- A carrier pigeon. Lock that door.
Get that pigeon.
Listen. "Dear Dan, we are trapped on the second floor...
...of the Moonbeam Inn on Highway 51.
The place is a nest of Nazi spies.
They're going to blow up the magnesium plant at 5:00.
Bring help at once. We mean it. Urgent!
With fondest regards, yours truly,
Laurel and Hardy, ex-air raid wardens."
How's that?
Now...
You've got to get up early in the morning to fool us.
Throw it out the window.
- Does it know where to go?
- Now, pigeon, you go straight to Huxton.
Yeah, and find Mr. Madison.
He's the editor of the paper.
That's one of our pigeons.
We have enemies in this house watching us. Come on.
- Who's there?
- It's Dan.
- We're rescued! Give me the key.
- I gave it to you...
Oh, did you? I don't remember you giving me the key.
I'm sure that you're...
Just a minute, Dan. Be right with you.
I tell you, you did not give me the...
So sorry, gentlemen.
We leave for the plant immediately.
Heydrich, you take care of our friends here.
- When?
- At your pleasure, of course.
Come.
- Well, goodbye.
- Freeze.
Hey, you.
No, you.
Stop.
No!
Put that apple on his head.
Yeah.
Go ahead.
Now come here.
Turn around.
Here.
Now, shoot that apple off his head.
- I don't want to shoot...
- Go ahead. No monkey business.
- He's my pal.
- Go ahead.
Goodbye, Ollie.
Heil Hitler!
You...
Quick, the gun! Get...
You... You...
Get the wire. We'll tie him up.
- Just like Mr. Norton.
- That's right.
There we are.
- Now he does look like Mr. Norton.
- Yeah.
Oh, 4:25. We'd better get going.
Come on.
Will you fix that thing?
Thank you.
Let that alone.
- What's the matter?
- I got something in my eye. Take the wheel.
Give me that!
Now look what you've done.
Get your hands off of that!
Come on and help me push this thing up the hill.
Hey.
Come here.
Take this rope and put it around that post.
Will you wait a minute!
You're always in such a hurry.
- This one?
- Yes, that's the one.
The only one up there.
Heave ho.
It serves you right.
Oh, hello. We want to apply for a job.
The plant's not in operation yet.
You'll have to come back next month.
What's going on here?
Herman, you take over here.
You've been trained for this job.
Now, take your time and do it thoroughly.
Get to work.
- Are you ready?
- Just one more...
...then the cable to the plunger.
Give me two nickels for a dime, quick.
- Here.
- Thank you.
Here it is.
Operator 14. What is the incident?
Incident? Inc...?
She thinks I'm Mr. Norton.
Well, be Mr. Norton.
Tell her about the magnesia plant.
Oh, yes, incident. Ajax Magnesium Plant.
This afternoon, 5:00.
They're going to blow it up.
- And Mr...
- One hundred forty-five incendiary bombs.
- Mr. Hittle...
- Seventy-two casualties.
A hundred and fifty-six German parachutists. All water mains broken.
Pestilence. Famine.
Everything. Be there at 5:00.
Don't forget. Goodbye.
Now what are you trying to tell me?
I was trying to tell you about Mr. Hittlemouse...
It's not "Hittlehouse," it's "Mittlehause."
And what about him?
- He's not gonna blow up the plant.
- I know, but they won't catch him.
You see, he was with the air-raid wardens.
- Then if they...
- So what? He's with the air...
Come on! Thank you very much, lady!
But the Norton incident wasn't at the magnesium plant.
That's where it is now.
Start with your auxiliary police and firemen.
Everything's in work.
All units are being notified.
- Now, let's go.
- Well, I still don't understand it.
Come along, Captain Biddle.
Mr. Rittenhause. Mr. Rittenhause.
I heard some sirens.
They seem to be coming towards the plant.
Get out of here.
- Spread out your men. Police the entire area.
- Yes, sir.
- Rope off the danger zone.
- Yes, sir.
Play out enough hose...
...to cover the entire plant.
- Yes, sir.
Out the back way.
We'll connect out there.
We'll locate your emergency station...
...here in the watchman's shed.
- All right, Dan.
Stand by with Mrs. Norton.
Better work up a report on the general situation.
Charlie, be sure you have enough messengers for liaison.
Okay, Dan. All right, boys, stand by.
I don't know what this is all about but it's good going, anyway.
- Thank you, major.
- Oh, Mr. Madison.
Mr. Madison, I opened the door...
...and there they were, stretched on the floor.
They're real casualties.
- What happened?
- They slugged me.
- A whole car full of them.
- Take this man to the ambulance.
They went in the generator building with dynamite.
Take care of him too.
Clear the area near the generator.
Surround the plant. Organize search parties.
Will you take over, major?
- Surely.
- Come on, Charlie.
- We better have a look in here.
- All right, but be careful. Come on, Charlie.
Check that doorway, Charlie.
Don't move.
- Hurry it up, boys.
- Ready.
Come on. Come here.
Look. Mittlehause.
- Look.
- So what? We're looking for Middling.
Come on.
Madison! What is the meaning of this?
- What's going on here?
- Mr. Norton, you're terrific.
- How did you know there were Nazis here?
- Nazis? Why, l...
I'm sorry, Mr. Norton, if we had to change your incident.
- So you put in that call.
- We had to, Dan.
- I hope we didn't upset things too much.
- Well, I'll say, you didn't.
The only ones upset are the Nazis.
- We got every one of them.
- Oh, no, you didn't.
We're three happy chappies with snappy serapes
You'll find us beneath our sombreros
We're brave and we'll stay so
We're bright as a peso
Who says so, we say so
We're Three Caballeros
Oh, through fair
Or stormy weather
We're always together
So let come what may
Like brother to brother we're all for each other
The Three Caballeros
Forever we'll stay
Oh!
"Felicitations to Donald Duck... on his birthday, Friday the 13th... from his friends in Latin America."
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!
What a pleasant surprise.
Whoops.
Ah, now, isn't that wonderful?
Which one should I open first?
My mama told me to take... this one!
I wonder what's in it.
Oh, boy! Home movies!
Just what I wanted.
Well, well, well.
Well, doggone.
A little penguin.
Oh. What a cute little fella.
Well, what is this?
How do you open this thing, anyway?
On with the show.
The show must go on.
Sí, señor.
That means "strange birds."
Oh, sure, sure.
I know: Birds.
Yes, amigo, your feathered cousins.
You know, Donald, you have more relatives here... than there are coffee beans in Brazil.
For instance, take the one who lives way, way down...
But suppose we let my friend
Professor Holloway tell us about it.
From the beginning to...
El fin, the end.
Yes. Thank you.
Professor?
This story takes us way down to the South Pole.
Rather than have you stand on your heads... let's turn the theater over.
There. That's better.
Two things you will find most of down here... are ice and penguins.
It's amazing that anybody would want to live here... but most penguins wouldn't live anywhere else.
You couldn't find better weather for fishing... skiing, tobogganing... or swimming.
And there is nothing the average penguin likes better... than a day at the beach.
Uh, but come on.
Let's meet Pablo.
He lives down at the end of Main Street.
Let's go in and see what's cookin'.
Pablo could never remember having been warm enough... and so his closest companion was SmokeyJoe... his little stove.
Between chills,
Pablo had one burning desire... to spend the rest of his life on some tropical shore.
So we see him bravely set forth for the isle of his dreams.
The other penguins turned out to give him a big send-off.
But when he gets just so far away from his stove...
See what happens?
Too bad.
Perhaps he'll give up this wild idea.
But no.
He's off to another start.
This time he's bringing a friend.
Anyway, it was a hot idea.
Well, maybe he'll be content to stay at home this time.
But no!
There he goes... hotfooting it to the land of the sun.
By now, the farewell committee has been reduced to two.
Discouraging, isn't it?
Suddenly,
Pablo got one of those ideas... that change a person's whole life: A boat.
But where would he get a boat?
Just watch.
Where there's a will, there's a way, they say.
And now, the official launching.
Day after day, the south wind carried him north.
One day, a blanket of fog rolled in... and it was so thick...
Must be near Cape Horn.
As the fog lifted... he found himself headed straight through the Straits of Magellan... and northward along Chile's rocky coast.
One day, a storm cloud came up... just a little bitty old storm cloud, though... and just tried awful hard to have its first storm.
Didn't amount to much, though.
One day on lookout,
Pablo had a bit of a shock... a waterspout off the port bow!
But it proved to be theJuan Fernandez Islands... where Robinson Crusoe once lived... and still does, apparently.
Four bells and all's well.
According to Pablo's chart, he should be nearing Vina Del Mar.
And strangely enough, that's just where he is.
He sailed past Lima, capital of Peru... hugging the coastline with a tenacity of purpose... seldom found in a penguin.
One day his telescope picked out a city... high up on top of a mountain.
The map said it was Quito... and it was right smack on the equator.
It wasn't as easy to cross... but with a little help from Neptune, he made it.
So, making a left turn, he followed the equator... headed for the Galapagos Islands.
Ah, that good old sun.
Pablo felt that he'd never get enough of it.
Oh, he hadn't counted on this.
Things looked pretty bad.
Help! Man the pumps!
She's sprung a leak!
Pipe all hands on deck!
Do things! Get going!
Take to the lifeboats!
Abandon ship!
Unruffle the mizzenmast and man the poops!
And, well, don't just stand there.
Get going!
Swab the decks, and...
Heavens.
Look! What's that?
Just what he's been looking for.
Pablo has finally reached the isle of his dreams.
And so, as the warm tropical sun... sinks slowly in the west... we leave little Pablo, a bird in paradise... a picture of health in his new coat of tan.
He should be the happiest penguin in the world.
Only sometimes... he gets to thinking...
Never satisfied.
Well, that's human nature for you... even if you're a penguin.
You're absolutely right.
And now, Donald, let's hop over the Andes.
From these snowcapped peaks to the depths of the Amazon jungle... one finds many more strange and exotic birds.
Like the anambepreto of Colombia and Venezuela.
He carries his own bagpipes hidden under his beard.
Then there's his cousin, the arapapa... pride of Paraguay, whose perfect appearance... permits his pompous pride in his pompadour.
And la tijereta, the scissors bird... the Colombian cutup.
Then there's the arapacu de pico curvo.
He's always sticking his nose into things.
Did you ever see such a freak beak, huh?
Speaking of beaks, what a time two toucans have making love.
When they're beak to beak, they can't get cheek to cheek.
Because when one toucan turns his head... only one toucan can.
Uh-oh. Who's that?
Oh, a thousand pardons.
Señor Donald, I would like to have you meet... one of the most eccentric birds you have ever seen.
His name is the aracuan.
You'll find him most everywhere.
Eh, glad to know ya.
Pleased to meet ya.
Now, he's called the aracuan... because of the peculiar song he sings... which sounds something like this.
By the way, amigo, did you know some birds are skilled craftsmen?
Uh-uh. Is that so?
Yes. Quite a builder is the little marrequito.
His nest may look haphazard in design... ah, but every single stick and straw... is scientifically placed to withstand... the stress and strain of... well, almost anything.
Literally dotted are the shores of many tropical marshes... with the brilliant plumage of the flamingo.
And now, Donald, how would you like to hear a story... about another bird so amazing you won't believe it?
Oh, sure. You bet.
It's a tale told by an old gaucho from Uruguay.
Listen.
It was early one morning in springtime... just as day was beginning to break.
As the sun came up over the...
Oh, but I am forgetting my story.
It was silent out there on the pampas.
Only one little bird was awake.
From his nest came the little hornero to see if the...
Oh, say, do you know why this bird's called the hornero?
- No?
- Uh-uh. Why?
You see, his nest is just like the horno.
That's the oven where we bake our bread and our...
Oh, oh, oh, you know who that is?
That's me, when I was a little gauchito.
Many, many years ago, of course.
And why was I up so early?
Because I was going out hunting all alone.
First I put on my bombachas and tied on my chiripá.
Then I slipped into my new botas.
And I put my boleadoras where I could reach them in a hurry.
¡Gauchito.!
Not forgetting my hunting knife.
And now I was ready to go.
Now, the best place to hunt the wild ostrich... is out on the wide open plains... on the broad, flat land of the...
Flat land?
Say, what am I doing here?
Oh, now I remember.
This day I was hunting for condor birds high up in the mountains.
While looking around for the condors,
I climbed to the top of a rock.
No, come to think of it, it was a tree.
Let's see, maybe it was a rock after all.
Although I could swear it was a tree.
Oh, what's the difference?
Let it go. Let it go.
My sharp eyes soon discovered the nest of a...
Psst! ¡Gauchito.!
The nest.
I could tell from the wings he was... he was a least five meters from tip to tip.
The biggest condor bird in all of... ¡Caramba.!
What's this?
I couldn't believe my eyes.
No, it couldn't be.
But there it was.
I was looking face to face with a flying donkey.
The donkey bird didn't seem bashful.
He flew right up close to...
Quick, Gauchito.!
Now! Get him, quick!
Aha. Got him.
Now, now. Easy, easy.
This donkey should be worth a fortune.
I couldn't let him get away.
So I made up my mind that I'd catch him if it took me the rest of...
Now I had him!
Hold him, Gauchito.!
Ride him, cowboy!
He acted just like he was loco, but I was an expert, of course.
He thought he could throw this gauchito... but he soon found out who was the boss.
Psst, Gauchito.!
Who is the boss?
I decided to train him for racing... far out where nobody could see...
'cause I planned to win thousands of pesos... for this little burrito and me.
I made brilliant plans for the future.
We'd live like a couple of kings... and I'd be the world's richest gaucho... with my hands full of big diamond rings.
¡Ah, macanudo.!
Okay.
This burrito was tame as a kitten.
He was learning new tricks every day.
You should see how he begged for my mate.
He liked it much better than hay.
Then we soon fell asleep by the campfire.
We both were as tired as could be... and tomorrow was very important... for little Burrito and me.
For this was the day of fiesta.
The gauchos were happy and gay.
They danced the zamba and gatos... and gambled their pesos away.
While the crowd sang and danced in the plaza...
I just stood in the shade of a tree...
and watched them toss coins at the sapo.
But this game meant nothing to me.
Some others were rolling the bochas and betting on games of this kind.
But I didn't join in these pastimes.
I had something bigger in mind.
- ¡Ay, caballo.!
- The race was about to begin... and the grand prize was 1,000 pesos.
The gauchos were howling with laughter... when they saw us come out on the track.
I whispered,
"Remember the wings, Burrito."
Oh-oh-oh-oh!
Not yet! Not yet!
The gauchos and horses were all on their toes.
We were off with the speed of a bullet.
We flew down the track like the wind.
Every gaucho was, uh, uh...
Meanwhile, Burrito and I were, uh, uh, jockeying for position.
¡Gauchito.!
They went that way.
That way.
No wonder they laughed.
I didn't even look like a jockey.
Hey, Gauchito.
Come on.
Look like a jockey.
Pepito, the pride of Mendoza, was setting a furious pace... and Fuego, Gordito and Pingo, you never have seen such a race.
Now it's Pepito and Fuego.
It's Fuego and Pepito.
And there comes Gordito on the rail.
Do your stuff, kid.
No?
Well, don't wait too long or...
Look out!
Ah-heh.
What did I tell you?
Come on, Gauchito.
The wings, the wings.
Quickly I untied the rope.
Come on, come on.
Quickly I untied the rope.
The knife! The knife!
¡Córtalo, córtalo.!
And now we go.
You should see little Burrito... tearing up the track, so fast you couldn't see us.
And now down the home stretch comes
Fuego. Now Pepito's ahead on the rail.
Here comes Pingo, Gordito and Gato, and Dorado is right on his tail.
But where is Burrito?
Here comes Burrito!
We passed them like they were standing still.
And now coming down across the line of finish, it's Burrito, the winner!
Well, amigos, it was all over but the shouting...
I thought.
Caramba.
The jig was up.
And what became of the flying donkey, you ask?
Neither him nor me was ever seen again... as long as we lived.
Adios, amigo.
Adios. So long!
Good-bye!
What's going on here?
Presents! Oh, boy!
Let me at 'em!
Say, what's this?
Ah, Pato Donald.
Or, as you Americans say, what's cookin'?
Joe Carioca!
Well, I'll be doggoned!
Imagine meeting me here.
Donald, have you ever been to Baía? No?
- No, I haven't.
- Ah, Baía.
Land of romance... moonlight, music, beautiful girls.
Oh, forgive the interruption,
Donald.
This crazy bird is the aracuan.
He's meio maluco, a very stupid fellow.
But tell me, Donald, have you ever been to Baía?
- No, I haven't.
- No? Oh...
I am so sorry for you.
Ah, Baía.
It is like a song in my heart.
A song with love... and beautiful memories.
I close my eyes, and I can see it now.
I can see the beautiful twilight in the sky.
I can feel the breeze from the bay... and I can hear the music, the music of Baía.
When twilight is deep in the sky
Someone that I long to see
Keeps haunting my reverie
And so the loneliness deep in my heart
Calls to you
Calls to you
I live in the memory of
Many dreams ago
When the stars were bright
And you were mine alone
My love for you cannot die
Though the oceans run dry
Or heaven falls from the sky
Now you're gone
Can't you hear my lonely call
Morena
Make my life complete again
How I pray for the day
When I'll see your smile
And my heart will beat again
When twilight is deep in the sky
Someone that I long to see
Keeps haunting my reverie
And so the loneliness deep in my heart
Calls to you, calls to you
Ah, Baía.
Beautiful Baía.
Oh, forgive me, but have you been to Baía, Donald?
- No.
- No? Well, let's go.
If you go to Baía, my friend... you'll never return.
Have you been to Baía, Donald
- Uh-uh.
- Well, let's go
- They have vatapá
- What's that?
- They have caruru
- Is that so?
- They have munguzá
- Munguzá?
- Do you like to samba
- Oh, sure.
- Have you been to Baía, Donald
- No.
Well, let's go
When you go to Baía, my friend
You'll never return
Have you been to Baía?
- No.
- No? Well, let's go!
Hurry, Donald! Hurry!
Well, well. Here we are in Baía, land of romance.
Baía? Where is Baía?
We are in Baía.
Look.
Well, I'll be doggoned.
- Who's that?
- Donald, that's Yayá.
- Who's Yayá?
- Ah, a baiana.
Donald, quindins de Yayá.
She sells cookies.
Cookies, my friend.
Donald!
- Hello.
- i Como vai!
Hi, toots.
What?
- Who is that guy?
- Oh, he's a malandro, Donald.
Oh, boy!
This Donald!
Did you ever see such a fast worker?
No, no, Donald.
Take it easy.
Look.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!
Come on, boys.
What do you feel about Baía, huh?
Tell me the truth.
Oh, swell! Marvelous!
Romance.
Moonlight.
Beautiful girls.
Or as you say, you are a wolf.
Take it easy.
You have more presents.
Presents?
Whee! Presents!
What? Oh! Oh!
Oh, I'm a midget!
Oh!
You, you're a midget too!
Oh-ho, Donald!
Don't worry.
It is simple, my friend.
Just a little black magic will fix you up.
Believe it or not, it is very simple!
You are very funny fellow!
Oh, my, my, my, my, my, my!
You kill my head!
- Huh?
- Oh, my friend... you are using the wrong finger.
Now, blow!
- Thanks, pal!
- B-B-B-But, Donald, your presents!
My presents!
Aha, my friends!
Welcome to Mexico.
Son of a gun, it's a pleasure to see such fine gentlemen in Mexico.
Here, amigos.
Donald!
José.
¡Caramba.!
Now we're three gay caballeros.
We're three caballeros
Three gay caballeros
They say we are birds of a feather
We're happy amigos
No matter where he goes
The one, two and three goes
We're always together
We're three happy chappies with snappy serapes
You'll find us beneath our sombreros
We're brave and we'll stay so
We're bright as a peso
- Who says so?
- We say so
The Three Caballeros
We have the stars to guide us
Guitars here beside us
To play as we go
We sing and we samba
We shout, Ay, caramba
- What means "ay, caramba"?
- Oh, yes. I don't know.
Through fair or stormy weather
We stand close together
Like books on a shelf
And pals though we may be
When some Latin baby says yes, no, or maybe
Each man is for himself
- What's this?
- What's this?
This is your gift from Mexico, Donald:
A piñata.
Oh, boy, oh, boy! A piñata!
What's a piñata?
A piñata is full of surprises, presents.
It is the very spirit of Christmas.
Christmas?
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all...
No, no, Donald.
For goodness sake.
Not "Jingly Bells."
In Mexico, they sing
"Las Posadas."
This custom takes place on each of the nine days before Christmas.
Each evening, the children gather at the village church... and form a procession symbolizing the journey of Mary and Joseph... from Nazareth to Bethlehem.
The little ones carry images of the saints from house to house...
singing a plea for shelter, or posada.
A reply comes from within:
"No posada. No shelter."
Looking sad and downhearted, they try again... but the reply is still the same.
"No shelter. No posada."
They repeat this song time after time... and always they are refused.
Until at last they reach a friendly house and the door is opened.
"Come in, come in, holy pilgrims.
This humble home is yours."
And now, Mary and Joseph have found shelter at last.
Then the rejoicing begins... the feasting, the celebrating... and finally the biggest surprise of all:
Breaking the piñata.
And now for your piñata, Donald.
Here you are.
Go to it.
One side, boys. One side.
I'm gonna smack it!
Uh-uh, no, hold it.
Ho-Hold it, Donald.
First you must be blindfolded.
We have to put this over your eyes.
That's part of the tradition.
Now, now, now, stand here.
Come here now.
Hit it hard.
All right, let's see you smack it.
Just a minute.
Uh-oh. Aha!
You see, Donald? Didn't I told you it was full of surprises?
Did you know that the history of Mexico is in her flag?
Oh, yes! You see, many hundreds of years ago, the god of the Aztecs... commanded them to build a big city where they would find an eagle destroying a serpent.
But when they find this eagle, he was sitting on a cactus on top of a rock... way out in the middle of a lake.
¡Caramba.! To build a city here would be almost imposible.
But they built and built and built some more... until today, believe it or not, the lake is full of Mexico City.
Sweet music
Gay serenatas
Tropic skies
Of velvet blue
Magic gardens
Perfume the breezes
Where true love
Brought me to you
Mexico
With all your romance
Your song oflove
Will live forever after
Mexico
Sweethearts are singing
Lovebirds are winging
Through a sky filled with laughter
Paradise
That's where I found you
Your magic smile
Made the blossoms bloom around you
Mexico
Why do I feel as I do
I simply fell
Under the spell
Of you
- ¡Oba.! ¡Oba.! Nice! Oh, boy!
- Wow!
Ah, but this is only the beginning, amigos. Take a look at this one.
Oh, boy!
What a pretty picture!
And now, for a nice little trip through Mexico... on the magic serape.
- All aboard, amigos.
- Oh, what's goin' on here?
Paradise
That's where I found you
Your magic smile
Made the blossoms bloom around you
Mexico
Why do I feel as I do
I simply fell
Under the spell
Of you
Of you
And this, Donald, is Patzcuaro... a fisherman's paradise.
Yeah! Beautiful!
Oh, boy! Would I like to come back sometime... and do a little fishing.
Uh-oh!
- What's going on here?
- Shh!
This is my favorite dance, the "jarabe pateño."
Doggone it!
I can't get it.
No-no-no-no-no-no-no, boys!
You are off the beat.
This is the way.
Well, what do you know?
Thanks.
I had a wonderful time.
So long!
This is the way they dance in Veracruz.
It's called the "lilongo."
Hi, girls!
May I cut in?
Watch your step, Donald!
Some fun, hey, kid?
So you like dancing, huh?
- Okay.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Go on, Donald.
Don't be afraid.
Not so fast, boys.
Go on in, Donald.
Don't be bashful.
Hi, toots!
Am I intruding?
Hey, Donald, you are what they say, off the cob!
- You know, corny.
- Oh, yeah?
Swing me with that boogie beat, Joe!
How am I doin', toots?
Come on, let me down.
- I wanna stay!
- Take it easy, Donald.
There she is...
Acapulco Beach... the Riviera of Mexico.
Take the telescope and have a look at what you might call the hot stuff.
Oh, boy! Am I going to like this place.
Oh, boy! Hot stuff!
I'll be right down, toots.
- Hello, my sweet little bathing beauties.
- Donald! Donald!
We're three caballeros
Three gay caballeros
They say we are birds of a feather
Where's Donald?
Aha! I am a son of a gun. Look at the little wolf in duck's clothings.
Come to Papa.
Wha-What's going on here?
Come here, you little rascals.
Now I've got ya. Uh-oh.
Doggone this confusion!
Oops! Where is she?
Come here, my little enchilada.
I've got you this time, tootsie.
Peek-a-boo.
I see you.
Hey, where am I?
My, my, my!
Ain't this fun?
Here I come!
This time I'm gonna get you!
Oh, no, no, no, Donald!
Don't do that!
Let me go. Get me outta here!
You can't do this to me.
Get your hands off of me!
This is a free country.
Bye-bye!
So you like pretty girls, huh?
Let's go!
- Let me go!
- Don't ruffle your feathers, Donald!
Look, I will show you the nightlife of Mexico City.
- Beautiful, no?
- Colossal!
Oh, boy! Mexico City?
Very beautiful city.
Careful, Donald.
Even the sky is full of romantic!
You belong to my heart
- She's beautiful!
- Now and forever
- And our love had its start
- Oh, boy!
Not long ago
We were gathering stars
While a million guitars played our love song
When I said "I love you" every beat of my heart
- Oh, boy, oh, boy.
- Said it too
'Twas a moment like this
Do you remember
And your eyes threw a kiss
When they met mine
Now we own all the stars
And a million guitars are still playing
Darling, you are the song
And you'll always belong to my heart
'Twas a moment like this
- Do you remember
- Uh-huh.
And your eyes threw a kiss
- When they met mine
- Don't do that!
Now we own all the stars
And a million guitars are still playing
Darling, you are the song
And you'll always belong to my heart
You belong
To my heart
Now and forever
Three caballeros
Three gay caballeros
Three caballeros
Three gay caballeros
When I said "I love you"
Every beat of my heart said it too
- Some fun, hey, kid?
- Some fun, hey, kid?
Some fun, hey, kid?
We're three caballeros
Three gay caballeros
They say we are birds of a feather
We're happy amigos
No matter where he goes
The one, two and three goes
We're always together
Darling, you are the song
And you'll always belong to my heart
Pretty girls. Pretty girls.
Pretty girls. Pretty girls.
What? Oh, boy!
Uh-oh.
Uh, what's happening, anyway?
Where am I?
Uh-oh!
My, my!
Uh-oh.
What?
What?
What?
Come on, torito, give it to me!
What's the matter with you?
Are you color-blind?
Come on, bull. You bashful?
Oh, through fair or stormy weather
We're always together
So let come what may
Like brother to brother we're all for each other
The Three Caballeros
Forever we'll
Stay

Sally: Well, Because it... I thought you'd enjoy seeing the plantation.
Johnny: Is Grandma mad at us?
Sally: But of course not, Johnny.
What ever gave you that idea?
Johnny: Well, Georgie says everybody's mad at what Daddy writes in the newspaper.
Johnny: Don't Grandma read the newspaper?
Don't she?
John: She does. And she likes what's in it.

Doshy: Welcome home, my daughter.
Doshy: And you too, sir. Oh, it's good to have a man in the house again. Turn around here, young man.
Doshy: Let me have a look at you. You favor your grandfather more every time I see you. Toby!
Toby: Yassum, Miss Doshy.
Doshy: This is my grandson Johnny...
And he's the apple of my eye.
Doshy: Now, you take good care of him and show him our plantation.
Doshy: And if he gets into trouble, you see that he gets out of it.
Toby: Yassum.
Doshy: I hope you're a noisy boy. I love noisy children.
Doshy: It makes it so much easier to tell where they are and what they're up to.
Johnny: Aunt Tempy, is that Uncle Remus?
Tempy: Uncle Remus? Lawzy no, honey.
Dat's jes' Ned.
Toby: Come on, I'll show you the big grandpa clock.
Doshy: I've been hearing about the clatter you've raised in Atlanta.

Perhaps I'd better show him myself. Come along.
Doshy: Now be careful you don't bump into things.

Have you changed your mind,
John: or are you still going to stay?
Sally: Oh, I have to stay John.
It wouldn't be fair to mama.
Sally: She has enough responsibility...
I'm not going to saddle her with ours.
John: But it's only for a short time.
She's be only too glad to take care of Johnny.
Toby: When dat big han' gits straight up, watch out!
Toby: What I tell you!
John: Oh, Miss Doshy, Sally wants Johnny to stay here for awhile... with you.

I'm not going back.
John: Then... I'll have to go without you.
And I'd better hurry, or I'll miss my train.
Doshy: Miss it! You won't regret it.
Johnny: Daddy? You're going back?
John: Yes, son.
Johnny: Why?
John: I have to.
Johnny: But... You... You've never left mama and me before.

John: Taking care of mother and grandmother.
You'll do that now for me, won't you?
John: Goodbye, son.
John: Goodbye Miss Doshy.
Doshy: Goodbye John.
John: Goodbye Sally.

Tempy: Stick his nose in dish here kitchen and we have Brer Rabbit stew.
Remus: Sis Tempy, I said it befo', I says it now and I says it again' there never was a better cook
Remus: in these here parts nor nowhere else.

Sally, Johnny didn't mean no harm.
Remus: He was jes' trying to be like
Brer Rabbit. I tol' him a tale 'bout de
Remus: tar baby an' he just got a li'I bit too bodacious, and outreached hisse'f, dat's all.
Sally: Uncle Remus, i'm trying my best to bring up
Johnny to be obedient and truthful. But you and your
Sally: stories are making that very difficult. I think maybe it would be better if he didn't hear any more for awhile.
Remus: Well, Miss Sally, de stories ain't done no...
Sally: They only confuse him. Now I know you mean well, Uncle Remus, but Johnny's too young.
Remus: Miss Sally...
Sally: I'll have to ask you not to tell him any more.
Remus: Yassum, Miss Sally...
Sally: But what else could I have done, mama? I can't just overlook it, he has to learn to mind.
Doshy: That's very true, but without
Uncle Remus and his stories,
Doshy: the child will be utterly desolate.
He needs something to hold on to.
Sally: Well, he has his mother... and his grandmother.
Doshy: We're not enough, sally. The boy must have friends. And if it's not Uncle Remus, or the Favers
Doshy: children, then it must be someone else... someone of his own age. That's just good common sense.
Tempy: What you trackin' through here for anyway?
Ain't I done tol' you 'bout messin' 'roun' my kitchen?
Sally: Johnny!
Johnny: Yes, mama.
Sally: Do you know what next tuesday is?

Johnny: A party? Sure!
Sally: With lots of nice little boys and girls.
Johnny: Can i ask Ginny?
Sally: Well, there'll be so many other children, dear...
Doshy: That one more won't make any difference.
Johnny: Gee! Thanks! Will daddy come?
Sally: Well, dear... uh... I'll write and ask him.
Johnny: Oh boy.
Johnny: Teenchy! Here Teenchy!
Johnny: Teenchy! Here Teenchy!
Teenchy! Where are you?
Johnny: Uncle Remus? A present for Teenchy! Where's Teenchy?
Remus: He's gone.
Johnny: Gone? Then we gotta find him. Sump'n might happen to him... if he runs around loose.
Remus: He ain't runnin' 'roun' loose.
Johnny: Then, where is he?
Remus: He's back at de Favers. Dat's what he b'longs an' you knows it.
Johnny: But teenchy's my dog. He's mine.
Johnny: Ginny gave him to me, and you said...
Remus: Nemmine what I said! Yo' maw tol' you to take dat dawg back whar he

Johnny: You don't even care! Teenchy's gone... and you don't care at all.
Remus: Don't make no difference whether I does or whether I

[ Master Of Ceremonies ]
On the pages ofAmerican folklore, a legion ofmighty men have left the symbols oftheir greatness,
There was Paul Bunyan ´s ax;
John Henry´s hammer;
Davy Crockett´s rifle; and then, quite unexpectedly, one comes upon a tin pot hat, a bag ofapple seed,,, and a holy book,
And strangely enough, these are the symbols of one ofthe mightiest men ofall--
John Chapman, a real-life pioneer,
With the passingyears, however, reality has given way to legend, until today we know this remarkable man simply as Johnny Appleseed,
This is his story, told by an old settler who knewJohnny well,
Listen,
[ Old Settler Narrating ] Well, sir, every time I see an apple blossom sky,,,
I think ofJohnny Appleseed,
´cause, of course, them clouds up thar, they ain ´t really clouds at all,
No, sir,
Why, shucks, there wouldn ´t be no apple blossom sky,,, ifit weren ´t for the fact thatJohnny--
But now, hold on here, Guess I´d better start back to the beginnin ´,
That´s when Johnny lived on a farm near Pittsburgh town,
The year was 1 806, or maybe there around,
Now,just to look at him you´d sayJohnny Appleseed never would make a pioneer,
- ## [ Whistl i ng ]
- He was such a sawed-off, scrawny little fella,
´Course that didn´t faze Johnny none,
Shucks, he had his apple trees and the morning sun and the evening breeze,
- ## [ Conti nues Whistl i ng ]
- [ Twitteri ng ]
# The Lord is good to me #
# And so I thank the Lord #
# For givin´ me the things I need #
# The sun and rain and an apple seed #
#Yes,  He´s been good to me #
## [ Continues Whistling ]
# I owe the Lord so much #
# For everything I see #
# I´m certain ifitweren´t for Him #
#There´d be no apples on this limb #
# He´s been goodto me#
# Oh,  here am I ´neath the blue,  blue sky #
- # A-doin´ as I please #
- [Twittering ]
#Singin´ with myfeathered friends #
- [ Buzzing ]
- # Hummin´ with the bees #
# I wake up every day #
# As happy as can be #
# Because I know that with His care #
# My apple trees theywill still be there #
# Oh,  the Lord is good to me #
## [ Continues Whistling ]
[ OldSettler]
Workin´, singin´, carefree andgay,
That´s howJohnny spent each day, attendin´ to his apple trees,
But lately littleJohnny here would feel a stirrin´in the air--

PoorJohnny,
He weren´t no pioneer, and he knowed it,
It was alljust pretend, and them folks goin´ west to build this nation,,, sure made pickin´apples look like a plumb useless occupation,
- ## [ Fades ]
- Well, sir, that´s when a miracle happened,
""Well, what´s holdin ´ya,Johnny?, "" says a voice,
""Go on, Go on out west, ifthat´s your choice, ""
Well, sir, it was an angel,
Johnny´s own private guardian angel,
Might look mighty queersome to you and me, but, you know, that´s just the way
John figured he ´d be,
Wel l,  speak up,  boy.
Don´t stand there gawki n´.
U nlock your jaw and get to talkin´.
Y-Y-Yes,  sir--
Yes,  sir!.
Why don´t I go west?.
´Cause I ain´t got the muscle... nor the breadth ofchest,
Out tharit´s the strong men who survive, and I´m about the puniest feller alive.
Shame to ya, Johnny.
You got faith and courage and a level head.
But,  shucks, you see,  sir, all I know is... apple trees.
And what´s wrong with apples, ifyou please?.
Ain´t they ´bout the finest fruit in all the land?.
Why,  shoot,  man, they take the cake.
Just think, Johnny, of all the things that apples make.
There´s,  uh, apple pickles.
# Oh-so-tastyapple tarts andapple pastry#
# Apple dumplings
Not to mention-- #
- Applesauce?.
- Yes!
# And there´s apple fritters light as thistle #
# And for folks to wet their whistle #
[ Together ]
# Tangy apple cider in a glass #
Stew ´em,  fry ´em, boil ´em,  bake ´em.
- Apple pie and apple cake ´em.
- Yep!
# You can cook ´em any way#
# There´s apple this andapple that#
#The recipes´d fill yer hat #
#Why,  I could carry on like this all day #
# So,  packyer stuff and git a-goin´ #
# Git them apple trees a-growin´ #
#There´s a lot ofwork out there to do #
[ Together]
#There´s a lot ofwork to do #
- Yes,  sir!.
- ## [ Whistling ]
I mean,  no,  sir.
Yousee, sir, I ain´t got the traps, ain´t got the gear,,, ornone ofthe things
I´ll need out there,
You ain´t got the--
Dadgum it,  boy, 
I´m ashamed ofyou.
You got the stuff to see you through.
Why,you got all the seedsyou´re needin´, and for pretty darn good readin´...
#There ain´t nothin´ finer than your book #
Here´s a mighty handy bonnet.
Even got a handle on it.
#Turn it upside-down and you can cook#
# So,  come on,  son and git a-goin´ #
# Git them apple trees a-growin´ #
[ Together] #There´s a lot ofwork out there to do #
# Oh,  there´s a lot ofwork to do ##
[OldSettler]
Well, sir, that´s howit all began,
That´s howJohnny, all alone, set out to meet the great unknown,
´Twas a mighty big and fearsome place,,, for a man to face,
A little man, and all alone, without no knife, without no gun,
And though the forest is dark and wide,,, with fearsome critters on every side,
Johnnyjust kept walkin ´ on,
Walked until at last he found a little spot of open ground,,, with fertile soil and warmsome breeze, a likely place for apple trees,
Now, the varmints here, they couldn ´t know,,, ifJohn was friend orJohn was foe, so some took off in sudden flight,,, and some got set to claw and bite,
But ifJohnny seen ´em he paid no heed,
Just got busy a-plantin´apple seeds,
## [ Whistl i ng ]
## [ Conti nues ]
Now, them varmints come from everywhere,,, to watch that man a-diggin´ there,
Didn´t like what they was seein´,
Didn´t trust no human bein´,
## [ Conti nues ]
Yep, that ornery human had to go,
But who was a-gonna tell him so?,
Well, not a soul could answer that,,, till here come along a black-and-white cat,
Now, he weren´t too bright, but he didn´t much care,
He knowed he had a certain ai r... about him,
## [ Whistling Continues ]
[ Sniffi ng ]
## [ Continues ]
Well, sir, that done it,
The critters ne´er seed the beat ofthat, the likes ofa human a-likin´ that cat,
Why, shucks, this little man had went and busted every precedent,
He was the very first to come,,, without no knife, without no gun,
And so it was, from that time on, every last livin ´ varmint was a friend to John,
- ## [ Conti nues ]
- They surely was,
# The Lord is good to me #
# And so I thank the Lord #
# For givin´me the things I need#
# The sun and rain and an apple seed#
# Yes, He´s been good to me ##
Well, as time went byJohnny kept right on a-plantin´his apple trees,,, and makin´ friends everywhere, and his best friends was the pioneers,,, for, of course,John was plantin´more than an apple tree,
He was plantin´his own boundless faith and courage too, and that give folks new heart, new hope in the job they had to do,
As more and more pioneers come to push back the forest, the kindly deeds oflittle Johnny Appleseed,,, spread throughout the land, and more ´n once, with a good old-fashionedjubilee, folks would honorJohnny Appleseed and the fruit ofthe apple tree,

[ Old Settler ] Now, sometimes ifJohn was a-passin´by,,, he´d mosey over and kinda look in on the doin´s,
´cause it sure tickled him to see how the fruit ofhis labors,,, brought all kinds offolks together and made ´em good neighbors,

[ Old Settler] Yup,Johnny did bring folks a heap ofhappiness,
But, shucks, he weren´t lookin´ for thanks,
Didn´t have time fer it,
He knowed a man can´t take no rest,,, ifhe aims to plant the whole darn wilderness in apple trees,
And so it was-- for more´n 40 year,,,
John walked and planted that old frontier,
[ Thunderclap ]
Yes, sir, 40 years of walkin ´ and plantin ´,
And in that space oftwoscore year,,, this little man, he throwed his shadow clear across the land, across 1 00, 000 miles square,
And in that shadow everywhere,,, you´ll find he left his blessin ´s three:
[ Chorus ]
# Love and faith #
# And the apple tree #

´Cause it´s like I said, ifyou´ll recall:.
Them clouds ain´t really clouds at all,
They´re apple blossoms, ifyou please, from John ´s heavenly orchard ofapple trees,

There´s poetry in trees, they say, and, well, one day a poet found it,
Then a music master wove around it,,, melody,
An artist touched it, gave it form in colors rich and warm,
And now we bring to you these three:. poem, picture, melody,
A simple tribute to a tree,
[ Chorus ]
# I think that I shall never see #
# A poem lovely as a tree #
# A tree whose hungry mouth #
# Is pressed#

# At God#
# All day #
# And lifts her leafy arms #

Accordin´ to them,
Pecos Bill was the roughest, toughest, rootin ´-est, tootin ´-est shootin ´-est cowpoke that ever lived,
Well, any story about ol´ Pecos is bound to be right strong medicine, so maybe it´s best to sashay into it kinda gentle-like,

Uncle Roy.
- Yes,  honey?.
- What makes the wolves howl like that?.
Wolves?. Ha!
Those are coyotes.
-Aren´t they, Roy?
- Yep,  they´re coyotes. Bobby´s right.
- They always howl when the moon is bright.
- Why?.
Well, that´s quite a story,
- Cowboys in it?.
- Yes, sirree,
- I njuns too?.
- Well,  could throw in maybe two or three.
But mostly this story is about Pecos Bill.
- Pecos Bill?. Who´s he?.
-## [ Guitar: Sharp Strum ]
- What?. Never heard of Pecos Bill?.
- Imagine that.
Why,  I thought everybody knowed Pecos.
Why,  Bobby, 
I´m surprised at you.
Bill was the world´s greatest buckaroo.
# He was the roughest, toughest critter
Never known to be a quitter #
# ´Cause he never had no fear for man nor beast #
- Yep,  that there Pecos Bill was--
- [ Whinnying ]
Easy,  Trigger.
I´m not forgettin´ Bill´s horse.
Why,  shucks, 
I couldn´t forget Widowmaker.
- Widowmaker?.
- [ Laughs ] That´s a funny name.
But that horse earnedit just the same,
- He was a killer.
- Dynamite on the hoof.
Yep,  Widowmaker was Bill´s best pal, until along came that beautiful prairie gal.
[ Whinnying ]
- Aw,  shucks. A woman in the story.
- But what a woman.
# She was fresh as the dew#
# On a prairie rose #
# A true thoroughbred #
# From her head to her toes #
#That there was Slewfoot Sue #
# Sweet Sue #
Slewfoot Sue. Huh!
I´d rather hear about the coyotes.
Yes,  Uncle Roy, you started to say--
Why the coyotes howl at the moon that way?.
You´re right,  honey, but it all fits together.
Can´t tell one without the other, because the story of Bill and that Slewfoot gal... is the story of coyotes and why they howl.
I´m gettin´ down to the details right now.
Now,  here on the map ofthe old U.S., completely surrounded bywilderness,  lies Texas.
-[Cowboy] Amen,
- ´Course,  there´s some other states scattered around.
- Yeah, like Wyoming,
- Milwaukee,
-And Long Island Sound,
- Right,
[Roy Rogers ]
Down Texas way a river flows,
Where it comes from, nobody knows,
Where it´s a-goin´ don´t no one care,
Just doggone glad it´s a-leavin´ there,
- That there´s the Pecos River,
- She was pure alkali,
Just naturally mean water,
Why, the buzzards won ´t even touch it,
-## [ Whistling ]
- Into this fertile garden spot,,, once there come a prairie cart,
- [ Shouti ng,  Chatteri ng ]
- There was Ma and Pa and 1 6 brats, four hound dogs--
[ Cowboy ]
Yeah, and a couple of cats,
[ Roy Rogers ]All a-goin´ west, lookin´ for elbow room,
Sure could use some ofthe same,
Crossin´ the Pecos River bed, somethin´ fell out and lit on his head,
Folks didn´t even know he was gone,
Ol´ wagon just kept a-rollin´along,
Yep, it was Bill,
Poor little critter,
Homeless as a poker chip,
# ´Long came night and a prairie moon #
# Old Ma Coyote a-hurryin ´ home #
# She was due for a shock at herjourney´s end#
# Fer the stork had delivered a dividend#
Plumb unusual!
Yep,
´Tain´t never happened before,
-Probably one ofthem newfangled models,
-[ Sniffi ng ]
# Bill looked up and then he grinned#
Shucks!
# Ma´s ol´heart just plumb caved in #
# Bill seen right off that he needn´t fear #
# He´d staked himself a claim right here #
Headed straight for that old chuck wagon,
Yep, ol´ Bill was hungrier than a woodpecker with a headache,
And so it follered as a natural fact,,,
- that Bill growed up with that coyote pack,
- [ Growls ]
He soon become the main top hand,,, in a way they all could understand,
[ Yel I i ng ]
But little Bill, he couldn´t rest,,, till he´d proved hisself the A- 1 best,
So he studied the other varmints too, then showed ´em all a trick or two,
Outloped the antelope,
Outjumped the jackrabbit,
[ Rattl i ng ]
[ H issi ng ]
[ Yel I i ng ]
Yeah, Bill even outhissed the rattlesnake,
# Then one day #
# ´Cross the burnin´sand#
# A stranger come #
# To the Pecos land#
# The usual committee #
# Was there today #
# To welcome their guest #
-# In #
- [ Foal Whi nnyi ng ]
# The usual way #
Now, 50 to 1 weren´t no fair fight, but one plus Bill made itjust about right,
[ Yel I i ng ]
Well, it was the beginning ofa beautiful friendship,
From that time on them two stuck together,,,
Iike warts on a toad, like birds ofa feather,
When Bill growed up, it was natural, of course-- he ´d choose a career to suit him and his horse,
Yep, Bill become a rootin ´, tootin ´ cowboy,
Ya-hoooo!
Ya-hoooo!
# Ohhhh #
# Pecos Bill was quite a cowboy down in Texas #
[ Gunshots ]
# And the western superman to say the least #
# He was the roughest toughest critter #
# Never known to be a quitter #
# ´Cause he never had no fear ofman nor beast #
# So yippee-i-yay

[ Cow Mooing ]
# Once a band ofrustlers stole a herd of cattle #
- [ Mooi ng ]

# And when he caught them crooked villains #
# Pecos knocked out all their fillin´s #

# He knew he´d never reach the border #

# Ifhe didn´t get some water #

[ Whinnying ]
# So he got a stick and dug the Rio Grande #
## [ Yodeling ]
[ Whinnying ]
# While a tribe ofpainted Indians #
# Did a war dance #
# Pecos started shootin´ up their little game #
# He gave them redskins such a shake-up #
# That theyjumped out from their makeup #
# That´s the way the Painted Desert got its name #
# So yippee-i-yay
I-ohh #
-# Fer the toughest critter west ofthe Alamo #
- Ohh!
- [ Gunshots ]
- # While reclinin´ on a cloud high over Texas #
# With his gun he made the stars evaporate #
# Then Pecos saw the stars declinin ´#
# So he left one brightly shinin ´#
# As the emblem of the Lone Star Texas state #
# So yippee-i-yay
I-yay #
# Yippee-i-ohh #
- Yep, them was happy days fer Bill and that hoss,
- [ Gunshots ]
Looked like nothin´ could ever come between ´em,
Then it happened,
Now, Bill was happy that fateful day, a-killin´some time in his carefree way, inventin´a one-man rodeo,,, a-buttin´heads with the buffalo,
Poor Bill,
Yeah, happy as a hog in a turnip patch,
And then old man Fate started dealin´ from the bottom ofthe deck, for down the stream come Slewfoot Sue,,, with all her charms revealed to view,
Looked like somethin´ from out´n a dream-- first female woman
Bill´s ever seen,
## [ WolfWhistle ]
- She was strange,
- Unusual,
Yeah, but powerful stimulatin´,
Like a slug ofrye on an empty stomach,
# Give ´im a right peculiar feelin´#
# Set his senses plumb to reelin´#
-# With a poundin´sound inside his ears #
- [ Stampeding Hoofbeats ]
# Like the gallopin´hooves ofa thousand steers #
# Inside his chest was a-seethin´and churnin´#
# His blood was a-boilin´
His brain was a-burnin´#
# A-burnin´ with the fires that could only be cooled#
# In the beckoning depths #
# Oftwo blue, limpid pools #
Yep, I ´amour had come to Pecos Bill,
[ Barki ng,  Howl i ng ]
Yahoo!
Widowmaker was plumb puzzled,
Looked like trouble to him, and he sure was right,
Bill was busy inventin´ courtin´, western-style,
# He arranged for the moon #
# To rise just right #
# And flood the land#
# With a silvery light #
# Ordered the stars #
# In heaven above #
# To form a token #
# Ofundying love #
# Then, ´cross the sky #
# In words offire #
# Bill told sweet Sue #
# Ofhis own heart´s #
# Desire #
# Sweet Sue #
# I love #
- [ Kissi ng Sound ]
-# You ##
And so Sue named the wedding day, but there was a price
Bill had to pay,
Sue wanted a bustle-- the finest, of course-- and she aimed to be wedded a-ridin´ Bill´s horse,
Well, Sue got her bustle and it sure was classy,
Put the finishin ´ touch on that sweet gal´s chassis,
Why, that there happy, blushin ´ bride,,, was a-bustin ´ out with girlish pride,
## [ Wolf Whistles ]
But Bill had promised Slewfoot Sue a ride on Widowmaker too,
[ Gul p ]
- Would that horse be willin´ to let Sue ride?
- [ Whinnying ]
Well, here comes the answer-- fit to be tied,
Widowmaker was plumb irritated,
But it didn ´t bother Sue none,
She walked right up to that critter´s side,
Her gentle hand touched his bristlin ´ hide,
Her foot found the stirrup, With a flick ofher bustle, Sue was aboard,
- And sought for the tussle,
- [ Yawns ]
The proceedin ´s begun to commence,,, forthwith,
[ Widowmaker Whi nnyi ng ]
No doubt about it.
That there Sue was a regular female buckaroo.
[ Whinnying Continues ]
And then, that bustle--
Underneath them frills and flounces,
Sue was developin´ plenty ofbounces,
Got to be more´n that gal could handle, and Sue took off like a Roman candle,
That devilish contraption ofsteel and wire,,, kept bouncin´ that poor gal higher and higher,
Soon it was plain to the multitude,,, that Sue was a-gainin´altitude,
Sure looked like she was a goner,
But no,
Here come a ray ofhope,
Look! I t were Bi I l and his trusty rope.
He´d durn soon put a stop to this,
- Shucks, Bill was never knowed to miss,
- [ Crash ]
Bill was calm, confident,
He built his loop with careless ease,
He judged his distance, tested the breeze,
Then a whirl and a twirl and a twist ofthe wrist,
He let ´er go,,, but the champeen missed,
How it come to happen, nobody could ever figure out,
## [ Whistl i ng ]
She was offagain on her heavenly flight,
Up, up she went, clean out ofsight, till far into space this unfortunate maid,,, finally come to the moon, and that´s where she stayed,
In the state ofTexas,
U,S,A,,
Iife still goes on in the same old way,,, and the Pecos River still flows on, but the greatest cowboy on Earth,,, is gone,
Yeah, Bill went back to the coyotes, but he never forgot Sue,
And every night, when the moon ris´high, he´d lift his voice in mournful cry,
- [ Howl i ng ]
- Bewailin´ the fate ofhis lady fair, his long lost love in the sky up there,
- [ Howling Continues ]
- So painful was his griefto see, the varmints joined in out ofsympathy,
And that´s how come, to this very day, coyotes howl at the moon that way,
- # Move along #

Love is a song that never ends
Life may be swift and fleeting
Hope may die
Yet love's beautiful music
Comes each day like the dawn
Love is a song that never ends
One simple theme repeating
Like the voice of a heavenly choir
Love's sweet music flows on
Like the voice of a heavenly choir
Love's sweet music flows on

Mother, what we going to do today?
I'm going to take you to the meadow.
Meadow? What's the meadow?
It's a very wonderful place.
Then why haven't we been there before?
You weren't big enough.
- Mother, you know what?
- What?
We're not the only deer in the forest.
- Where did you hear that?
- Thumper told me.
Well, he's right.
There are many deer in the forest besides us.
Then why don't I ever see them?
- You will, sometime.
- On the meadow?
Perhaps.
Hush now.
We're almost there.
- The meadow!
- Wait!
Bambi, wait!
You must never rush out on the meadow.
There might be danger.
Out there, we're unprotected.
The meadow is wide and open, and there are no trees or bushes to hide us.
So we have to be very careful.
Wait here.
I'll go out first. And if the meadow is safe, I'll call you.
Come on, Bambi. It's all right.
Come on.
Good morning, Prince Bambi.
Good morning, young prince.
Hello. What ya eatin'?
- Clover.
- It's awfully good.
It's delicious.
Why don't you try some?
No, no, not that green stuff.
Just eat the blossoms.
That's the good stuff.
Thumper.
- Yes, Mama?
- What did your father tell you?
About what?
About eating the blossoms and leaving the greens?
Oh, that one.
Eating greens is a special treat.
It makes long ears and great big feet.
But it sure is awful stuff to eat.
I made that last part up myself.
Watch out.
Watch out.
That's little Faline.
He's kind of bashful, isn't he, Mama?
Well, maybe he wouldn't be if you'd say hello.
Hello, Bambi.
I said hello.
Well, aren't you going to answer her?
You're not afraid, are you?
Well, then, go ahead.
Go on, say hello.
Hello.
You!
He stopped and looked at me.
Yes, I know.
Why was everyone still when he came on the meadow?
Everyone respects him.
For of all the deer in the forest, not one has lived half so long.
He's very brave and very wise.
That's why he's known as the
Great Prince of the Forest.
Faline!
Bambi!
Mother!
Bambi!
Bambi!
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!
Come on out, Bambi.
Come on.
It's safe now.
We don't have to hide any longer.
What happened, Mother?
Why did we all run?
Man... was in the forest.
Mother, look! What's all that white stuff?
Why, it's snow.
- Snow?
- Yes.
Winter has come.
Hiya, Bambi.
Watch what I can do.
Whoo!
Come on! It's all right!
Look!
The water's stiff.
Yippee!
Some fun, huh, Bambi?
Come on, get up. Like this.
No, no.
Kinda wobbly, aren't you?
Got to watch both ends at the same time.
Guess you better unwind it.
Arghh!
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up, Flower!
Is it spring yet?
No. Winter's just started.
What ya doin'? Hibernatin'?
Uh-huh.
What do you want to do that for?
All us flowers sleep in the winter.
Well... good night.
Winter sure is long, isn't it?
It seems long.
But it won't last forever.
I'm awful hungry, Mother.
Yes, I know.
Bambi.
Bambi, come here.
Look.
New spring grass.
Bambi. Quick!
The thicket!
Faster! Faster, Bambi!
Don't look back! Keep running!
Keep running!
We made it!
We made it, Mother!
We...
Mother!
Mother!
Mother, where are you?!
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!
Your mother can't be with you anymore.
Come.
My son.
Let's sing a gay little spring song
This is the season to sing
So I'd like to suggest
That we all do our best
And warble a song about spring
Spring, spring, spring
Let's get together and sing
Let's sing a gay little spring song
Just like the bird on the wing
Things always seem right
When you're cheerful and bright
So let's get together and sing
Sing, sing, sing
Let's sing a song about spring
Let's twitter and tweet
Like the birdies in May
Get into the mood
And be merry today
Forget all your troubles
And warble away...
Wait!
Oh, what now?
Hey! Hey!
Stop that racket!
Scat! Shoo! Shoo!
Let's sing a song about spring
I'll fix 'em.
There. I guess... that'll teach 'em.
Oh, what's the use?
This is the season to sing
Same thing every spring.
Tweet-tweet! Tweet-tweet!
Tweet-tweet! Tweet-tweet!
Love's sweet song.
Hm! Pain in the pin feathers, I call it.
Stop it!
Get out of here. All of you.
And you, too!
Hello, Friend Owl.
Don't you remember me?
Why, it... it's the young prince.
Bambi!
My, my, how you've changed.
Turn round there.
Let me look at you.
I see you've traded in your spots for a pair of antlers.
You know, just the other day I was talking to myself about you.
And we were wondering what had become of you.
Hello, Bambi!
Remember me?
Thumper!
Right-o!
Hi, fellas.
Flower.
Yeah.
Well, what's the matter with them?
Why are they acting that way?
Why, don't you know?
They're twitterpated.
- Twitterpated?
- Yes.
Nearly everybody gets twitterpated in the spring time.
For example... you're walking along, minding your own business, you're looking neither to the left nor to the right, when all of a sudden... you run smack into a pretty face.
You begin to get weak in the knees.
Your head's in a whirl.
And then you feel light as a feather.
And before you know it, you're walking on air.
And then you know what?
You're knocked for a loop.
And you completely lose your head.
Gosh, that's awful.
- Gee whiz.
- Terrible.
And that ain't all.
It can happen to anybody.
So you'd better be careful.
It could happen to you, and you, and...
Yes, it could even happen to you.
Well, it's not going to happen to me.
- Me neither.
- Me neither.
Ha! Twitterpated!
Oh...
Ahem.
Oh.
Hello, Bambi.
Don't you remember me?
I'm Faline.
Bambi.
Bambi.
Bambi!
I bring you a song
And I sing as I go
For I want you to know
That I'm looking for romance
I bring you a song
In the hope that you'll see
When you're looking at me
That I'm looking for love
I'm seeking that glow
Only found when you're young and it's May
Only found on that wonderful day
When all longing is through
I'm seeking that glow
Only found when a thrill is complete
Only found when two hearts gently beat
To the strains of a waltz
That's both tender and new
I bring you a song
For I'm seeking romance
You're by my side
There's a moon up above
It shines with a light
That's so mellow and bright
It's easy to see
That tonight we shall fall in love
I bring you a song
For I'm seeking romance
And you
It is Man.
He is here again.
There are many this time.
We must go deep into the forest.
Hurry! Follow me!
Faline!
Bambi.
Bambi, where are you?
Bambi!
Bambi!
Faline!
Faline!
Faline!
Listen.
- He's coming!
- Hush!
Be quiet.
- He's coming closer.
- Be calm. Don't get excited.
- We better fly.
- No. No, don't fly.
Whatever you do, don't fly.
He's almost here! I can't stand it any longer!
Bambi! Bambi!
Faline!
Bambi!
Bambi!
Quick, Faline! Jump!
Get up, Bambi.
Get up!
You must get up.
Get up!
Get up!
Now... come with me.
Bambi.
Hoo!
Wake up! Wake up, Friend Owl.
Wake up, Friend Owl.
Oh, what now?
Hey, what's going on around here?
- It's happened.
- Happened?
Yes. In the thicket.
Hurry up, Bambi.
Yes, Papa. I'm coming.
Oh. Well.
Look.
- Two of them.
- Oh!
Well, I don't believe I've ever seen a more likely looking pair of fawns.
Prince Bambi ought to be mighty proud.
Love is a song that never ends
One simple theme repeating
Like the voice
Of a heavenly choir
Love's sweet music
Flows on
What a beautiful old man.
What a lovely head.
India is filled with old men, memsahib.
But not like the one in the yellow turban.
He's like a head of John the Baptist.
The memsahib refers to the storyteller?
Are these silent monsters at peace with us?
It is but a truce they keep with man.
But I, who have seen their tusks stained red with blood...
I could tell you a tale of the silent ones.
For a few coppers? Eh?
Yea, for a bowl of rice?
What would you do with my image, memsahib?
I would keep it... for a memory of India.
Verily, you would have all India in your picture.
Nay, you would have the book
Of the jungle to read in my eyes.
In the beginning, you must think
Of nothing but silence... a silence so vast that the ear can hear it.
Great trees like the pillars of the temple... with ferns like green carpets underneath.
While above, under the dome of heaven
Where lived the winged ones... the wind moves restlessly,
Whistling across the roof of the world.
These are the eaters of grass
In a world of torn flesh.
Early the little fawns
Must learn their lesson__... feet that make no noise, eyes that see in the dark... ears that hear the leopard leaving his lair.
For the leopard lives by the law
Of claw and horn and fang...
He will kill for hunger and eat thereof... but he will never kill fork killing's sake ... a law all men break. but the jungle folk obey.
These are the lords of the jungle.
The tribe of Hathi, the silent ones.
They go their way, eaters of grass
In a world of carnage.
For the wolves are the true hunters of the jungle.
And like huntsmen,
They stick to their Clan... with a strict regard
For hunting Calls and tribal law.
Free Companions of the woods, they may
Fight and quarrel amongst themselves... until the strongest of them wins
The leadership of the pack.
Yet jungle folk say... the wisest amongst them is the tribe of Baloo, the bear.
He is a teacher of the jungle law.
Yet there is one who knows law__... the barrel-bodied mugger, the Crocodile... with his chin in the shallows
And lust in his cold heart... hoping to drag down to the depths
All who wander along his river bank.
And in the legends of the jungle
There is a black prince... shrewdest of the lords of claw,
Horn and fang...
As bold as a buffalo, as reckless as a wounded elephant... with a voice as soft as wild honey
Dripping from a tree.
Unbridled, unmastered, unafraid.
Bagrheera the black panther.
And now__
Behold, the villain of my tale.
The killer, the man-eater... the assassin who first brought murder to the jungle Clans.
Shere Khan, the tiger.
It is said that in his first kill__... when he was Cain to some
Poor Abel of the glades __... when he ran from the scene of his crime... the trees and creepers
Whipped him with their branches... and striped his yellow hide with the mark of Cain.
This evil lord must have his dish-lickers... his bullies for attendants.
Tabaqui the jackal.
And the hyena__... hungry for the scraps
Of their murderous master's feast.
But my tale is not alone
Of outcasts and heroes.
I will tell you also of the snake, Kaa, the wise one... the oracle who taught Mother Eve
The speech men use... for trickery and sin.
What is the book of life itself but man's war with nature... the struggle between village and jungle,
Under the mantle of wild creepers
And great trees... many a ruined City lies forgotten in the pages of time.
Yea, where a thousand war Chariots
Proclaimed the might of a great king... before whom all men bowed their heads.
Nothing remains but a trellis
For wild figs to sun upon.
But what of the great maharaja,
The loser in this battle?
He has left many such a palace
To his Cousins, the monkey folk.
The bandar-logs __
The outcasts of the jungle.
First you must picture me as I was, milords...
Buldeo, the mighty hunter.
It was a long time ago... and very far away... on a summer's evening in the Seeonee hills.
Ajao. Ajao.
Again some palaver.
Its Buldeo, master.
That fool would make speeches the whole day.
Come, Durga. Let, s listen to him.
Ajao.
You cannot build your houses just anywhere.
We have to plan out our village.
Someday there will be a mighty city here.
A mighty city with marble houses.
The temple shall be there, facing the marketplace.
That's where I wanted the bean patch.
No that's for the marketplace, as Buldeo says.
And the barbershop will face the temple.
I shall find someplace for the bean patches anyway-... outside your mighty city.
Go Durga. Take the child and the old man to the cart.
Nathoo.
Come Grandfather.
Did you hear that?
We're going to have a marketplace and a temple and a mighty city.
Aye we'll have all that
If we can beat the jungle.
But have you and your hundred years seen man win a war with nature?
Sit here Grandfather.
There Nathoo.
Now.
Go back to your work.
Nathoo?
Where are you my baby?
Rao. Look. Our little Nathoo, he has wandered away.
Now don't worry Messua.
The child couldn't go far.
I'll look for him right away.
Durga you search in there.
Nathoo.
Nathoo.
- Nathoo.
- Nathoo.
Nathoo.
Nat...
Buldeo.
Tiger. My husband.
Rao.
Abdullah. Singh.
Abdullah. Ali. Mohammed. Singh.
Tiger.
No.
No.
Poor master.
Poor Messua.
Let us all go and look for the child.
All men bring your spears.
Ali Singh Abdullah. Torches.
Follow me.
Nathoo.
Nathoo.
Nathoo.
Nathoo.
Poor little baby. Poor little Nathoo.
- And that poor mother.
- Poor mother
Is it every woman who can have a wolf nurse her baby for her?
Do you believe that Subahdar?
Oh yes memsahib.
And His Excellency your father, has many records... of wolf children from the Indian hills.
- It is true.
- True?
In the beginning was it not written... that the she-wolves loved the children of man?
Were not the wolves the foster parents
Of many a child in India?
Little naked and bold... the man's Cub entered the wolves' Cave.
Ahai.
He felt just as much at home with the cubs as at his mother's side.
Nathoo.
Nathoo.
Nathoo.
Lost and tired, he fell asleep among his brothers of the jungle.
Akkela the father wolf,
And Rakksha the mother wolf... knew that Shere Khan is prowling outside
Looking for the man Cub.
So they took him into their family.
Nathoo.
He grew up with the cubs.
They called him Mowgli-- the Little Frog.
Father wolf taught him his business until every rustle in the grass... meant just as much to him as to his brothers the wolf cubs.
All the lords of the jungle became his friends.
He had only one enemy-
Shere Khan the tiger.
Did Mowgli live to hunt Shere Khan?
Did he live? Oh.
But had I known then what I know now.
Twelve years had passed... and Shere Khan was on the trail
Of the wolf boy.

Wait. Wait.
Let me handle him.
Buldeo. Buldeo.
Ow. He bit me.
He is a wild boy.
Cover him up. Cover him up.
Who are you boy?
Can't you hear?
Give me a torch. A torch.
Give me that torch.
This boy has never seen fire before.
He's from the jungle.
Yes he is a wild boy.
We must be kind to him. Release him.
Release him?
Are you mad?
This is a thing of the jungle.
Let me look. Let me look.
Look at the scars on his arms and legs.
Those points on his bones--
He has run on all fours... with wolf cubs.
Poor child.
This boy has been reared in the jungle.
He has the evil eye.
I begin to think he has.
Moonshine.
I think this boy is Messua's little baby which was stolen that day we built the wall.
Could this boy be your's Messua?
No. He's not mine.
But he's a handsome boy.
Eyes like red fire.
Any woman would like to have a son like him.
But my Nathoo was soft and plump.
But, mistress, how could he be plump running naked in the woods?
I warn you all. He has the evil eye.
No, Buldeo.
He is some poor, lost lad-- though not my own.
But I am a lonely woman, and if you would let me...
I will shelter him for some other woman who has lost her son.
He is a wolf.
Let one in, and all will follow.
He will bring down the jungle upon us.
What the jungle has taken,
The jungle has restored, Buldeo.
Aye. Aye.
Take this boy into thy house my sister.
And out of your little hoard of money, forget not to honor me... for I have saved his life on this day.
- Release him.
- Wait.
Are you going to turn this devil loose before I can protect you?
A gun.
- Buldeo--
- Don't...
A gun.
Buldeo.
Now release him.
No.
No.
Boy.
Boy.
Will you come with me?
Come.
Oh. It's, it's all right.
Come on.
Come along. Come.
Come.
It's all right. Come along. Come.
It's all right.
Down upon our heads even before the temple... we have called the curse of the beast.
No more shall we prosper.
The wild pig will trample down our vines.
The tiger will stalk our streets.
We have opened our doors to the devil.
Don't look upon evil.
Mahala. Get home to bed.
At least I can keep my own daughter from harm.
Get back, Kpota.
Is that anyway to treat one who has come to live with us?
I remember the day I gave the first little shoes to my Nathoo.
Wolf-- Uh, wolf boy.
Uh...
Oh, those feet have never worn shoes.
No, you are not my son.
But you look very much like my son Nathoo.
Nathoo called me 'Mother'.
'Mother'.,
'Mother'.,
M-- Mother.
Uhh.
And what did the wolves... call you?
Wolves.
M...
Mowgli.
Mowgli?
A little frog?
Yes, you were like a little frog to them, the beasts of the jungle.
And so you are Mowgli to me.
Come.
Come on.
For months and months after that night...
Mowgli was busy learning the ways,
Language and customs of men.
What are you doing?
You are like a little panther.
I thought someone had found the hiding place.
- Hiding place?
- Mm-hmm.
- What is this?
- Money.
What is it for?
What is money for?
To protect us from hunger and cold.
It lives in a hole like a cobra?
No.
If we need a bag of rice, I give these to the merchant in the square.
He gives us the rice.
- What a fool that merchant must be.
- No.
Will the Man-Pack give us anything for this?
Yes.
Will Buldeo give me a tooth?
Tooth? You have all your teeth.
No. A -A sharp tooth.
Oh, a knife?
Yes. A knife tooth, like a tiger's knife.
What need have you for a knife?
To sink it in the throat of my enemy.
Your enemy? Ha. You talk about
Akela, the father wolf... and Raksha, the
Mother wolf, and how much... better it is in the jungle with all your friends.
Now who could be your enemy?
Shere Khan, the tiger.
Tell Buldeo to sell you a knife.
Give him the money.
I shall have a tooth.
I shall have a tooth.
My father says I mustn't speak to you.
What happened to him?
My father shot him.
We missed you six moons ago.
He was Baloo's cousin.
He had no man for an enemy.
But my father kills every bear he sees.
Why?
Because he is a great hunter.
He kills them even when he's not hungry?
Hungry? We don't eat bears.
Then why did he bring him here?
To show how brave he is.
And my father was very brave to kill that tiger.
That old tiger?
He lived on lizards and rats.
He was too old to hunt rabbits.
He must have died in his sleep.
I see. You could kill the bear and the tiger with one shot.
I kill Baloo's cousin?
I've gone fishing with him.
Fishing with a bear?
How can a bear bait a fishhook?
He looks in the river, he sees the fish he wants, then who.
He knocks it out.
Didn't I tell you not to speak with this thing?
I told Messua to keep you away from this house.
Messua sent me here to talk to you.
She sent me to get a tooth.
A tooth?
Yes. This is the tooth I want.
Put that knife down before I send a shot through you.
And then you would put my head on the wall... like the old Khan there.
But I would spring as I die and give this tooth back to you.
Now, now.
You're not in the jungle, boy.
No.
No, I am not in the jungle, Buldeo.
I am with the Man-Pack, but I am not a man.
What are you, boy?
I was until now a cub.
But now I have my tooth.
I can run with the jungle as I please.
I am a wolf.
If you had a knife... would you go back to the jungle?
The knife is yours for two annas.
Messua gave me three.
One, two, three.
There. Three is more than two.
Yes. More than two.
Now get out of my house.
See, Shere Khan?
- 'Tis for you-- deep in your throat.
- Mowgli.
Won't you be afraid to go back to the jungle?
Afraid of the jungle? Why?
I'm of the wolf pack.
They are my friends.
Then why did you buy the knife?
For Shere Khan, the tiger.
This is for him.
He drove me out of the jungle.
He went away far off... but he swore he would lay my bones in the river when he returned.
I also made a little promise.
I have told the wolves I would kill him.
You can speak their tongue?
You can speak to animals?
Can you talk to Rama, the great herd bull?
Rama is a dumb slave.
He has been with the Man-Pack so long... he cannot talk to anyone.
Can you speak to him?
What did he say?
Don't you know what the monkey people always say?
'We, the monkey people, are the greatest folk in all the jungle.
We know this is true because we always say it is true.
Mowgli, will you let me
Hear you talk to the wolves?
Yes.
Tonight when the moon rises.
- Are you afraid?
- No.
Let's go.
It's a wolf. What did he say?
Wood and water.
Wind and tree.
Jungle favor go with thee.
You have been given the favor of the jungle.
We be of one blood... you and I.
We be of one blood, you and I.
Come, Mowgli. Come.
Come. Come.
Ahai, Hathi.
I am with the Man-Pack now.
See, I have my tooth-- as sharp as a tiger's tooth.
He said Shere Khan is far away... but I had better take care and hide when he comes back here.
Hathi, will you warn me when he comes back to our jungle?
Thank you, brothers.
Then we shall see whose bones will be laid in the river.
Hold on. Tight.
Bagheera.
Mowgli.
Your claws are sharp and strong.
But not as good as mine.
Look.
Who is man that I should care for his ways?
Brown digger, eater of earth.
I am Mowgli of the jungle, back in the night.
Now that I have my tooth, who shall stay me when I strike?
Mowgli, come back.
I'm afraid.
There.
Mighty hunters, greater than your father... who killed everything until the jungle killed them.
Why did they go away?
Why did I go away?
Because I was a man cub, afraid of a tiger.
The jungle knew I was afraid and cast me out.
This was the king's palace.
King?
What is a king?
Oh, Mowgli. You know so much, and yet you know so little.
This was a great walled city... a city with hundreds of elephants and thousands of horses... and thousands and thousands of men.
And it all belonged to a great king.
And where is this great king now?
And where is this great king now?
Where is he now?
Where is he now?
Mahala?
Mahala?
- Mahala?
- Mowgli. Mowgli.
Here I am.
Mahala, are you hurt?
No, I'm all right.
The king's treasure chamber.
Look.
The emeralds.
Pearls.
This is like the stuff I gave Buldeo for my tooth.
The stuff that passes from hand to hand and never grows warmer.
Only this is yellow, and that was brown.
Let's get back to the light.
These pebbles are no good to eat.
There is nothing here. Nothing.
Am I nothing?
Father of cobras, we be of one blood, you and I.
She's only a little cub from the Man-Pack.
She means thee no harm.
Who art thou with the knife and the snake's tongue?
Mowgli, they call me.
I am of the jungle.
The wolves are my people.
Father of cobras, who art thou?
I am the warden of the king's treasure.
The great king built the stone above me that I might teach death... to those who come to steal.
Three times the stone has been lifted by thieves.
Look at thy feet.
The thieves are still here.
But I am no thief.
Indeed.
Be still, Mahala. Be still.
Oh, no, boy.
Let her run to and fro a while.
Let her make some sport.
The others did so until I touched them.
Then they whimpered a while... sighed and were still.
Kill him, Mowgli. Kill him.
Kill him?
Don't be afraid.
Look. Our father of cobras is so old, he has outlived his poison.
Kill me. Kill me. Kill me.
I am ashamed.
There has been too much talk of killing.
Come, Mahala. We'll go now.
Keep that silly treasure.
But I'll take this.
I can use it to prod Rama with.
Look at the ruby, Mowgli.
You could buy hundreds of villages with it.
Aye, boy. Thousands of villages.
Take it with thee.
But see that it does not kill thee at last.
Kill me? This stone?
Yes. I have outlived my poison... but that ruby holds more death than all my tribe.
It will kill and kill and kill... for killing's sake.
My strength is dried up, but this stone will do my work.
It is death, it is death, it is death.
But take the ruby if thou wilt.
Nay, father of cobras. I believe thee.
We shall go as we came.
Aye.
Ye be wise to take no death with thee.
May I take just this one piece, Mowgli?
Keep it if you like.
Get up, lazy bones.
I dreamed I was a princess in the city of the great maharaja.
Get up.
There's no fire in the grate, and there is no rice here.
But it was not a dream.
I saw the great king's city.
Get on with you.
Enough of this talk.
Dream?
This is no dream.
Maybe I am dreaming.
This is pure gold.
Who gave this to you, my darling child?
The white cobra.
Cobra?
Yes.
I did not want the diamonds.
Diamonds?
Nor the big ruby.
Big ruby?
This big.
This big.
Where? What nonsense is this?
Where is this room-- this ruby?
When did you go there?
Whose gold is this, Mahala?
The great king's gold.
In the treasure chamber
Of the king's palace.
I tell you, Father, Mowgli said
I might keep just this one.
Mowgli?
You have been in the jungle?
Last night Mowgli took me there.
But, Father, you will not hurt him?
I would not harm a hair on his head.
But you must never let anyone know about this.
Not a living soul, do you hear?
Yes, Father.
Good morning, Buldeo.
Good morning.
I-I can't take you now, Buldeo.
It'll be at least another hour.
Now wait a minute, Barber.
There-There is no river between us.
Oh. Oh, my-- my poor leg.
Uh, uh -This lumbago is killing me.
I can't go around with half my beard cut.
Ooh. Th--This lumbago is terrible.
I-- I-I can hardly bend my knee.
What makes you tremble like wash upon a line?
Now you keep out of this, Buldeo.
If I cut him, he-he doesn't have to pay.
- Y-You want to cut me?
- No, no.
Now listen here, barber.
I'm not a man to be shorn like a sheep in the midst of a brawl.
- Barber-
- I want...
- Barber?
- Hmm?
Move your left foot.
Well, uh...
I said the left foot.
Oh, oh, the-the l-l-l-l... l-l-- left.
Left.
This foot.
Excuse me, Buldeo.
You are standing on my money.
- Your money?
- I saw it first.
Jackals....
- It's mine.
- There's no need to quarrel.
- There's enough for all.
- Where? Where?
There's a lost city... in the jungle.
- You have found a treasure.
- Where?
Shh. Do you want to tell the whole village?
Not a word now.
My daughter found it with the jungle boy.
Tiger's coming.
Up, you dumb ones. Up.
Up. Ho. Ho. Ho.
Ho. Ho. Ho.
Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho.
Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho.
Ho. Ho.
Tiger. Tiger.
- Th-Th-The--
- Tiger.
To the temple. To the temple.
To the temple.
To the temple, all of you.
Shut the gates. Shut the gates.
Tiger. Tiger.
- Quickly, Little Frog, to the temple.
- No. Not I.
- I have my tooth.
- No, no. Don't go. Don't go.
Mowgli.
Wait.
Don't go. He will kill you.
No. I shall bring back his yellow hide.
Mowgli.
Mowgli.
Where is your son, Messua?
Where did he go?
Stop him. He has gone after the tiger.
Oh, that bragging of a child.
Don't be impatient, Buldeo.
He'll be back.
Suppose the tiger should kill him.
Ooh, what a tragic calamity.
No, no, we must save him.
We must bring him back.
How kind you all are to comfort me this way.
He really is a sweet boy.
I knew you would come to love him.
Love him? I wish I had a boy like him.
Now, don't worry.
If he's not back in a short time,
I'll track him to the ends of the earth.
Kaa.
Kaa.
I want to sleep.
Go away.
I have to talk to you.
Who are you?
Can't you see, Kaa?
What does the Law of the Jungle say?
We be of one blood... ye and I.
Ye come.
Ah.
It is a manling.
It's I, Mowgli, Kaa.
The Little Frog... the one that used to throw stones at me?
I was a cub then, Kaa.
You called me a flat-headed earthworm.
Forgive me... for you are a wise, old, strong... and most beautiful Kaa.
True.
I am beautiful.
Yes.
I am beautiful.
Now that I am a man,
I have a tooth.
I wish to pull the whiskers of death.
The striped one?
You know all things?
I know that Shere Khan has killed... and eaten... and now sleeps by the bamboo.
Tabaqui the jackal told me so... uh, before he passed on.
Tabaqui?
Yes, indeed.
Here he is.
How may I slay his master, Kaa?
He'd kill you with one blow.
Let us go upstream.
Hold on, little brother.
Shere Khan is nothing but a big cat... and all cats fear the water.
But Shere Khan will not follow me into the river.
Since you're a man... use your cunning.
And if I made him angry, Kaa... will he follow me into the river?
If he will not catch you first.
Thank you, wisest of all.
Go on.
I'll wait for you here.
Wish me good hunting...
O wise, strong and most beautiful Kaa.
Good hunting.
Good morning, Shere Khan.
Did I wake you up?
You hunter of worms... you striped cattle thief.
Don't sneak away.
Coward.
You mangy yellow dog.
Come back.
Can't you jump?
Are you too old, you frog eater?
Fish killer.
I'll get your hide today.
No, no. I won't come down.
You come up to me.
Get this.
And this.
Bah.
Come on, Shere Khan. Catch me.
- This is getting dangerous.
- Yes.
Maybe there are tigers waiting for us in this tall grass.
All right.
Stay here.
Shere Khan is dead.
I have killed Shere Khan.
What if he finds the boy and tears the secret from him... and-and then says he didn't find him?
You're right.
We cannot trust him.
Uh, you go first, and I'll protect your rear.
You go first, and I'll protect your rear.
Go on.
By the Bull that bought me,
I made a promise... a little promise.
Only thy coat is lacking before I keep my word.
Come, Shere Khan.
Lend me your coat.
You won't need it anymore.
You don't need to shoot, Buldeo.
I have killed him.
Look at him.
This is the end of a very old war.
Hmm. You have killed him.
You found him there.
I killed him with my tooth.
He is mine.
Who are you to tell me what is yours?
Get up, boy.
You took my daughter to the jungle last night.
You took her to a lost city.
Come on.
Take me to the treasure chamber.
I will not take you, Buldeo.
The Lost City is a city of death.
The treasure is death.
- I will never take you there.
- Come on, jungle brat.
Come on, or I'll shoot you.
- Go ahead and shoot.
- You scum of the wolf cave.
I-I hope he didn't shoot the boy.
No. No.
That's a sign for us.
Change back to a man... and spare my life.
Spare my life, Mowgli.
I did not know you were anything more than a herd boy.
May I rise up and go away... my lord?
Get up.
Go. Tell Messua that Mowgli has avenged her man.
He has killed Shere Khan and will bring home his yellow hide.
Maharaja.
Look.
Great king.
Go on.
Maharaja.
- Maharaja.
- Great king.
- Tell me the secret too.
- Tell me too.
They say there's enough for three.
- Great king.
- Great king.
Three old vultures.
- Go back to your village.
- Yes, milord.
- Ma-- Maharaja.
- My king.
- Where -Where is the treasure?
- Go back to your village.
Maharaja. Great lord.
Here. Here, you.
- Did he tell you the secret?
- Come on. Where's the treasure?
Do ¡V Don't try to cheat us.
The boy told you where to go.
Boy indeed.
Didn't I tell you the first time I saw him he was a witch?
I saw him with my own eyes change himself into a black panther.
Come on, Buldeo. No tricks now.
If you try to cheat us, we'll change you into something worse, I swear to you.
Get down, Bagheera.
Stop their quarrel.
The boy turned himself into a black panther before my eyes.
He is a witch, I tell you.
I must warn the village.
- Buldeo--
- Here.
I still think you're lying, and I'll soon find out.
Ho.
Ho.
Come, Shere Khan.
Look at Buldeo, the mighty hunter.
Ho.
Ho.
Now go get him. Get him.
What have I done?
Why do you stand there gaping so?
Gather branches. Build a fire.
Remember, he must have a chance to confess.
Yes, the three of us will deal with him alone.
We'll deal with him all right.
Clear the way.
Buldeo, we are ready.
Bring the witch-boy.
Well, boy?
Witch or devil, whatever you are... you heard them.
They are ready.
One last choice... the secret or the fire.
Buldeo.
Buldeo.
Let me talk to him.
Let me talk to him.
Good.
You talk to him.
I will leave you alone.
He won't tell.
I think we'll have to burn him.
Then we would never find the treasure.
We'll burn him... but not now.
The boy will lead us to the Lost City first.
Nathoo, my little son... why won't you tell them the secret?
Never will I take them into the jungle.
But they will set you free... free to live with me.
- Live with you?
- Aye.
I have a jungle mother too... and these two things fight together in me... like the snakes fight together in the spring.
I was a wolf.
The jungle cast me out.
I am a man.
The Man-Pack cast me out.
But you have killed Shere Khan.
You can go back to the jungle.
Aye, you can be lord of the jungle.
No.
I have nowhere to go... but into the Red Flower-- the fire.
No.
But it does not matter.
The jungle will know from Bagheera that I have killed Shere Khan.
No. The jungle will know from you, Mowgli.
See? Here is your tooth.
Mother.
Watch, watch, watch, watch.
- See them'
- He'll escape.
Are you also too dumb to see it?
Of course. He'll escape, and then we'll follow him to the treasure.
That's right.
You two go to the edge of the jungle.
Wait there and mark his trail.
Go.
Your time is up.
It's the mother witch who freed him.
Get her.
Wait. Wait.
Messua is no witch.
But Buldeo is a bad...
Tie both of them until I return.
Buldeo. He entered by this tree.
He never suspected we let him escape.
Don't say that.
See?
There is his trail.
I'm ¡V I'm frightened.
Hmm.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
We have our guns.
Let's go.
We can't be very far away.
Listen, brothers.
I have planted tracks for them as deep as an elephant's.
They will be here soon.
Quiet, you grinning black shadow.
Quiet, gray brother.
This is not our kill.
- Look, look.
- Look.
- Wait for me.
- Not so fast....
I will be the maharaja.
I will be the maharaja.
I will be the maharaja
Of this mighty city.
I will be the chief of all the temple.
I will be the chief of all the temple.
I will have all the barber shops.
I will have all the barber shops.
Let's look for the treasure.
Let's look for the treasure.
You look over there.
Uh--
Look.
I found it. I found it.
He found it.
Come on. He found it.
Wait for me.
Wait for me.
He found it. Come on.
Wait for me, Buldeo.
- Let us go in there.
- Let us go in.
I-I-- I found it.
I-I claim the right of first choice.
That's right. You deserve it.
He goes first.
I'll help you.
Help yourself. I'll help you.
Shoot. Shoot.
Sh-Sh-- Shoot.
Don't ¡V Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
Shoot. Shoot.
No, no. Don't ¡V Don't shoot. Don't.
Pull me out. Pull me out.
Pull me, Shoot, will you?
Pull me up.
You missed him.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...
A million.
I'll never have to count again.
Maybe we've been cheated.
It's gold. It's gold.
It's the mother and father
Of all the rubies in the world.
Where's my royal turban?
They're all pure gold... and they're all mine.
I shall walk upon gold.
I shall eat upon gold.
I shall use gold for a coverlet.
- Give it to me.
- Give it to me.
- It's mine.
- Give it to me.
No. Are you mad?
Shall I bash your heads in?
- Give it to me. I had first choice.
- No, it's mine.
The old cobra was right.
First, they go mad.
Don't forget, Buldeo, we are two to one.
I want that ruby.
- Let go.
- It's mine.
- Let go.
- You miserable barber.
It belongs to my robe.
It belongs to me, you understand?
- It's mine.
- Have we lost our reason?
Are we children?
Isn't there enough for three, 300, 3,000?
We'll be the most powerful men in all India.
Here.
I can buy thousand of rubies like this with my share.
Buldeo, you are wise and good.
You saved my life.
You killed the cobra.
You are my friend.
Then stop quarrelling.
Load yourselves up.
We have to get out before nightfall.
Hurry. We've got to get out of here now.
Thieves. Vultures.
Get out of the jungle.
Get out.
D-Did I hear what I heard?
The panther spoke with the tongue of the boy.
Yes.
The boy spoke with the tongue of the panther.
This place is bewitched.
Oh, the gold.
This is the way.
Where's the log? It was here.
How do we cross now?
We can wade through.
Wait.
There are crocodiles in this river.
What are you waiting for?
- It's this way.
- No, no. We came past this tree.
- I tell you, it's this way. Come on.
- No.
Quiet. Don't argue, Barber.
You're going the wrong way.
You're going the wrong way.
Give it to me.
- Wait here. Come on. Come on.
- Look.
They are heading back to the Lost City.
- Here it is. There it is. Come on.
- Over there is right. Let's go.
Come on.
Now I shall see if Father Cobra spoke the truth.
If the thing is death... these men will die.
You saw it.
I only wanted to look at the gold.
And he-- he tried to kill me.
I had to do it, Buldeo.
I had to do it.
Naturally.
You -You must bear witness.
Please, you must bear witness, Buldeo.
Quiet, gray brother.
He tried to kill me, Buldeo.
You must bear witness.
I had to kill him.
I had to kill him, Buldeo.
He...
Help. H-H-Help.
Help.
Did I hear someone call?
Now, gray brother... there is only one.
Bagheera, gray brother... chase him out of the jungle.
Sing him home.
You grinning monster.
Change into any beast you will.
Wolf, panther... any beast you will.
I'm not afraid of you.
Change.
Change.
Scream.
Scream, you witches of the forest.
Scream.
I'll burn that mother witch Messua... and I'll come back with a hundred strong... and set fire to your jungle... when the east wind blows.
I'll burn you all.
Burn you all.
Burn you all.
Hathi. Thou knowest the village
Of the Man-Pack that cast me out.
They're idle, senseless and cruel.
They do not kill the weaker for food... but for sport.
When they are full-fed, they would throw their own breed into the Red Flower.
This I have seen.
It is not well that the Man-Pack should live here anymore.
Kill them? Why?
What good are their white bones to me?
We shall let the jungle in upon them... and give the village back to the wild gourd vine.
They will burn us both.
Why did you fight them, Durga?
Why did you defend me?
It was I who brought him into the world.
He's my son.
Aye, mistress.
You could have saved yourself, Durga.
No, mistress.
If you must leave the world tonight, it is written that I shall go with you.
Buldeo is here. Look.
Buldeo.
What happened?
- Where is the pundit?
- Where is the barber?
Dead. Both dead.
Killed by the wolfboy.
But I know how to deal with him.
I'll burn him.
Burn him up.
I'll burn him.
We're all lost if the wind turns.
The jungle is burning.
Hurry up, Hathi.
Mowgli.
Where's my mother?
What have you done with her?
They left Messua bound in her house.
They would not let me take her.
They said she was a witch and that the fire would take her.
Now the same fire will take them.
But they were frightened, Mowgli.
Lead them, Mahala, to the little island in the middle of the stream.
- Where we saw the elephants, Mowgli?
- Yes. The fire can't touch you there.
Hurry. The wind is shifting.
Break the door, Hathi.
Break the door.
Push. Push.
Harder. Push.
I knew you would come.
See, Durga?
You'll be safe among them now.
- But you, my son-- Come with us.
Not while one little cub is in danger.
Now, go too.
Go on, Hathi. Go on. Go on.
Swim, gray brother. Follow me.
This way. Follow me.
Come on, Bagheera.
Come on, Hathi. Go on. Go on.
Go on, Hathi. Go on. Go on.
Mowgli.
Come back with us at last.
I am of the jungle.
Their lair is my lair.
Their trail is my trail.
Their fight is my fight.
Ahai.
He's no longer my son.
He's a godling of the woods.
So I didn't have my revenge after all.
I became no Mharaja... of a mighty city.
Even the little village burned to the ground.
In my struggle with the jungle... as you see, milords...
I was beaten.
And then? What happened then?
What became of Mowgli and your daughter?
And how did you escape from the fire?
That, memsahib... is another story.
What could be more symbolic of America than today's schoolgirl?
Intelligent, restrained, dignified...
BIG BAND MUSIC PLAYS
Oh...
We still haven't gone back far enough.
Let's look at the girl of 1913.
HORN HOOTS
ENGINE BACKFIRES
Let's go further back, shall we?
The girl of 1905.
Now, there WAS a girl.
Demure, sedate, obedient.
I'm sure we can do better than this if we just put our minds to it.
- It isn't very good, is it?
- A good artist isn't made overnight.
You've only been with us a short time.
I'll help you when we begin soup plates.
Miss Ingram, can't I start my REAL art classes?
There's no nicer accomplishment or better foundation for a woman than china painting.
I've got a foundation. I've been painting at home for years.
Let me see, now. I don't know where else I'd put you.
What about the life class?
Oh, that's too advanced.
Next year, perhaps.
I take the girls out in the country and we all do a landscape.
Cows, trees, some charming sycamores not far away.
Miss Ingram, we don't understand each other.
I mean a life class. The human figure.
Rembrandt says it's the basis of all design.
That's what I need. My anatomy's terrible.
The human figure?
You mean... unclothed?
- Certainly.
- Uh! Miss Sheldon!
Oh...
Miss Sheldon, I want to have a talk with you.
Go into my office.
TRAIN WHISTLE HOOTS
- Good morning, Dr Sheldon.
- Good morning.
TRAIN APPROACHES
- Hello, Papa.
- Hello, Dinah.
I'm glad you're here, dear, but your telegram didn't make it clear why you're home ten days before your vacation.
Anything wrong?
Well, sort of.
Suspended?
- Expelled.
- TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS
How's Momma?
Fine.
And Gene?
He's fine, too.
So are Mark and Sis. So is Ada.
So am I.
How are the neighbours?
Tom's fine.
How are YOU?
Fine.
Papa, if this was the first time I'd had trouble, you wouldn't think it was my fault.
I don't think so now, dear, unless you say it is.
- She called me immoral.
- Who did?
Miss Ingram. Merely because I wanted to paint the human figure.
If I can't be a good painter, there's nothing in life worth going on for.
Any other basis for this charge of immorality?
Yes. I said two petticoats were enough.
She said no respectable woman wears less than five.
And that I shouldn't have gone to a political meeting.
I said, "How can women be intelligent if they don't know about politics and economics?"
She said I wasn't there to be intelligent, but to be a lady.
I said I didn't have to learn that...
SHE CONTINUES TALKING
HORSE NEIGHS
..Then she called the debate off, after
I'd spent DAYS writing my speech!
It was about votes for women.
She said I was immoral, merely because I went to a political meeting alone.
She said I was to write her a letter of apology and stay in my room on Sundays.
I said I wasn't immoral, and I couldn't write the apology, and she said I was and I must, so... here I am.
I don't see how anyone could have expelled you, Di.
I don't see how they could have gotten a word in edgeways to do it!
No, Papa.
Dinah, I... don't like you being expelled.
Miss Ingram's right.
Immorality takes many forms.
Yes, Papa.
But I don't believe anyone should be punished or expelled because of the difference between two petticoats and five.
Nor for going to a political meeting.
But I would prefer you not to go alone to them.
Yes, Papa.
- Hello, Momma!
- Hello, dear!
Well, you look all right.
Is anything wrong at school, dear?
I was... expelled.
Expelled? Dinah... but what for?
For er... three petticoats, Lily.
- Why do you think she's home before vacation?
- Shhh!
Children... Andrew... Sit down.
Everything's ready.
Gene... Mark...
Sis...
In order to save you from a severe case of indigestion caused by prolonged curiosity...
..your sister Dinah has been expelled.
- CHILDREN ALL TALK AT ONCE
- Grace.
HALTING TROMBONE PLAYING
"My Bonnie Lies Over The Ocean"
Gene, can't you play anything else?
Oh... ishkabibble.
SUDDEN BURST OF TROMBONE
Come on, Miss Dinah.
Your momma ain't paying me
50 cents a day to sit still.
- I'll be done in a minute, Ada.
- The washing won't be.
Do you mean to say we only pay you 50 cents a day?
Why, that's wage slavery.
Things will change when we women can vote.
You'll be emancipated.
Been emancipated.
Dinah!
- Haven't I asked you?
- I need models and I can't afford to pay them.
- Can't you find someone who will sit still for nothing?
- Only if they're unconscious!
When I unpacked for you, I found...
Where did these things come from?
- Boxing gloves, Momma.
- Yes, I know.
A man on the train helped me with my case.
I started talking to him and he turned out to be James J Jeffries.
He gave me the gloves as a souvenir.
He even showed me his special punch he used on Bill O'Brien.
Dinah, nice girls don't speak to strange men.
Ada... I think we need more starch in these shirts.
Yes! >
Momma, didn't you hear what I said?
I met James J Jeffries.
Yes, I heard you. And I want you to remember not to talk to strangers.
Momma, a man like that isn't a stranger.
He's the world's champion.
When a man reaches that eminence, he's not a stranger.
He belongs to his public.
When I'm a famous painter,
I'll belong to my public.
Great artists never lose touch with the little people.
It would comfort me if you didn't lose touch with the dustpan and broom.
Start with the back porch, dear.
Go and put these hideous leather paws in the hall closet.
Yes, Momma.
Oh!
I thought your school vacation didn't start for some time yet.
Well, it... It doesn't. I...
I came home early.
Any difficulties?
Well, er... in a way.
Well, er... in what way?
I was... expelled.
Hm.
Is there a connection between your expulsion and those instruments of fisticuffs?
Oh, these? Oh, no. A friend of mine gave them to me.
Ah, a friend.
James J Jeffries, no doubt?
Why, yes. How did you know?
I have my ways. I hav...!
Di! What are you doing home?
Hello, Tom.
Did they close school early or something?
No, I... grew dissatisfied with certain things at Miss Ingram's seminary and terminated my stay there.
Oh? What things?
The artistic temperament doesn't need mundane reasons for decisions, Tom.
- No, I guess not.
- How's your aunt?
Fine. She doesn't like me working at Steuben's after class, but I need the money.
I didn't think you liked working with horses.
Not in the stable. The garage.
Well, I'd better go.
- I'll see you at choir practice.
- Yeah.
I'll meet you at Steuben's.
No, Di. I'm walking Bernice Eckert over.
- Who?
- Bernice Eckert. They moved into Dean Street.
I'll introduce you. She's really keen.
You'll like her.
I'm sure I will.
She's so... continental, sort of.
She's got that way, even when she just walks.
I'm anxious to see if you agree.
Well, I gotta go to work.
See you later. Bye.
Bye, Tom.
Continental!
THEY SING A SLOW HYMN

♪ Before our father's throne... ♪
No, no, no, children. No.
When you sing that line, you mustn't just say words.
You must really stand before the throne.
You must be up there. Give me that up-there feel.
Now, then. Once again.
Make me feel transported to a place in the heavenly cloud.

Well? Don't you agree with me?
She's very attractive. I understand why you feel as you do.
You know, Bernice is very deep.
She has moods, I mean.
Sometimes I don't understand her.
Like not letting me walk home with her now and not telling me why.
If a person has anything to say, they should say it.
Yes, but you're different.
I don't see why.
Well, you come to the point.
I merely don't believe in stooping to subterfuge.
You always say what's on your mind.
- I'll bet that's what happened at school.
- Partly.
That's what I thought. Well, are you going to paint here?
Heavens, no. There's only one place to study true art Paris.
- Paris?
- Of course.
I think your family would rather have you marry a nice fella and settle right down here in Baltimore.
I'd rather commit suicide.
You've certainly changed since you've been away at school.
You have to know what you want in this world.
- Yeah. Well, I think I know what
- I - want, but... I don't know how
Bernice feels about it.
We're very lucky, really.
- Why?
- Knowing what we want.
Most people don't.
But I have a long, arduous road ahead of me.
Painting is what you want.
You stick with it.
If I can help you, just say the word.
Thanks, Tom. If I can help you get what YOU want,
I'll be only too glad.
Well, thanks.
You know, I've always felt like you were my best friend.
Talking to you is just like talking to another man.
I'm certainly glad.
- Well, goodbye.
- Bye.
Making flutter eyes...
Dropping hymn books...
- ­ - Come in.
Oh, you're still busy.
It's all right, Dan.
- Mr Fletcher, our senior warden. Mrs Warford.
- How do you do?
Joined the parish, Mrs Warford?
Well, that's fine.
I like nothing better than to see a prosperous couple come in.
Yes. Mrs...
There's nothing finer for a family than their own permanent pew with brass plate attached.
The contributions go to our mortgage fund, which can always bear up to welcome additions.
Well, some day, of course, we'd like to, but... right now...
Aye.
Go ahead, Andrew. I'll sit and wait till you're finished.
I won't take long, Dr Sheldon.
They say a tale of woe is soon told.
Though I don't know why it falls so much harder on some than others.
- Didn't your husband get the job?
- Yes, but now he can't start.
- Why?
- The tool kit you had the machine shop lend him?
- Gone.
- You mean... stolen?
The whole box. And he can't work without them.
And a new set will cost 20.
DAN CLEARS THROAT
We just haven't got the money, Dr Sheldon.
And if he can't work, he can't get paid, and then what about the children?
- Oh, I don't know how these things...
- Yes, yes... - Ahem!
There they sat, on the porch.
The next morning, gone.
Every hammer and saw.
A new set is... 20.
We'll pay you back in no time, Dr Sheldon.
Ah... hem
Out of Ed's first pay cheque.
We don't like to be spongers, Dr Sheldon.
DAN SPLUTTERS
You just wouldn't believe the things that happen to us.
First, my cousin got sick...
Let's pray heaven favours you more these next months.
Oh, thank you, Dr Sheldon.
< And you'll never regret it. Never.
And thank YOU, Mr Fletcher.
And er... goodbye.
Goodbye.
DAN CLEARS THROAT
Aye, 'tis a blessed emotion, charity.
But sometimes, your generosity puzzles me.
The cheque can't be covered.
It's not drawn on the charity account, Dan.
It's from the Van Laden Memorial Fund.
But Mrs Van Laden left the money to buy a stained glass window to her husband's memory.
We'll pay it back from the Easter offerings.
It's practically malfeasance.
I doubt the vestrymen will like it.
These things didnae happen in Dr Reed's time here.
I know, Dan. I'll never be the man he was.
I'm not denying you've done some nice work.
Many's the time I said those very words to my wife.
"The pastor," I says to
Mary, "is a good man."
- But with faults.
- Aye.
Well, now, as to the books...
Start here on the pew holders' reference.
Gift from a parishioner. Very nice.
No, Dinah painted it.
Er... she's home early, isn't she?
Yes, she is.
Hm. Well, 'tis nice to have a lass with talent and spirit.
Especially if the spirit's guided and restrained in its proper channels.
- Yes.
- 'Tis a matter for thought, all right, these days.
Young girls traipse around with all manner of people.
Even pugilists.
Now, that's a thought, all right.
The important thing is recognising the danger signals in their changing the route of the train.
- Do you not agree?
- Oh, I do indeed, Dan.
As long as one does not derail the train so it never gets to its destination.
Hm. Oh, aye.
Ahem.
No, no. Stand up straight.
Take advantage of your height.
Yes, Pa.
Keep your guard high.
I wish certain people would leave my paints alone and stick with the trombone.
- I haven't touched your paints.
- Keep your guard up.
Where to this morning, dear?
Oh, just anywhere.
It's wonderful going out to paint, with no problems.
- I hope things stay that way.
- Why shouldn't they?
I can't get in any problems just painting.
Bye.
Well... prepare to defend yourself, Gene.
Hey, hey. Stay on your feet.
HE SNORES
HE SNORES
Not bad. Not bad at all, for a woman.
Needs a mite more red, though.
- Thank you very much.
- No trouble at all, little lady.
Now, would you please go away?
There's no question. You need red there, in the middle, on the nose.
That nose is OK.
I don't wish to disagree, but
I've seen lots of paintings, and, that way, it ain't no good.
- Looks good to me. Ain't that right?
- That's right.
Looks like you're wrong.
When I'm wrong, I'll let you know.
That nose ain't no good without more red.
- Here. Is that enough red for you?
- MEN ALL LAUGH
- Gentlemen, now, please!
- Sit down, darling, will you?
Stop that, please, gentlemen.
MEN ALL SHOUT
Gentlemen, please!
- Oh, you've ruined my painting!
- Gentlemen!

TELEPHONE RINGS
Hello?
Who? Mr Wade?
No.
Oh, yeah, I'm Tom Wade.
Do I know a WHO?
A Miss Smith?
No, I don't.
Say, who's this calling?
Oh. Oh, I see.
No, Sergeant, I don't.
What? A painter?
A Miss Smith, huh?
No, I never heard of her before.
Yeah, must be some mistake.
Yes, sir. Bye.
What was it, Tom?
Nothing, Mr Steuben. Police station.
What did they want, Tom?
Wrong number, Mr Steuben.
- Who did they ask for, Tom?
- Me, Mr Steuben.
Then, how could it be a wrong number, Tom?
They must have got my name by mistake, Mr Steuben.
What did they say, Tom?
Wanted me to put up 50 bail, Mr Steuben.
What for, Tom?
Some woman they arrested, Mr Steuben.
What did they arrest her for, Tom?
For causing a riot, Mr Steuben.
How did she do that, Tom?
She was painting, Mr Steuben.
Fainting? Ah, women are always fainting.
No, not fainting. Painting.
She's a painter, Mr Steuben.
METAL CLANGS
What took you so long getting here?
I don't just go around carrying 50, you know.
I had to go to the bank first.
- Why did they fine you so much?
- They didn't. It's bail.
I won't appear, and the money will be forfeited.
As they don't have my right name, that'll be the end of it.
- 50 bail?
- 10 apiece. For five of us.
Good day, sir.
You bailed THEM out with MY money?
Yes. If it wasn't for my painting, they wouldn't have fought.
I couldn't leave them.
That would be selfish.
My deepest gratitude, young lady.
Mighty nice of you to get us out.
- Oh, that's all right.
- Yeah. Glad to do it.
- It was a nice picture just the way it was.
- With a bit more red.
< Oh, I wouldn't say that.
< You wouldn't?
< No, I wouldn't.
I say it was great just the way it was.
< I still think it needed more red.
Wait a minute. There was enough red in it.
ALL CLAMOUR AT ONCE
MEN CONTINUE TO ARGUE
Why do you have to act as if you were my keeper?
Because I only have three dollars left.
Let us not inconvenience the law.
I'll pay you back the money, Tom.
- Yeah.
- It may not be right away, but I will.
Oh, sure. I know that.
What are you so worried about, then?
What am I worried about?! Work.
A chain, a crankshaft and a broken axle to fix by tonight.
Plus studying, plus writing a speech for the Forum Society.
And you drag me down to jail.
- I'm sorry.
- Doesn't help.
No.
Tom, that speech you have to write.
- What's it about?
- Equality.
Equality? What kind?
Any old kind of equality.
Oh.
Tom, I have a marvellous idea.
I have a wonderful speech on that, all written, for a debate we were meant to have at school.
You can use it.
No, Di, I couldn't do that.
Please do. I feel so badly about the trouble I've caused you.
It'll make me feel I've done something to show my gratitude.
Please.
Well...
Well, all right, if it'll make you feel better.
Oh, it will.
If I could have it any time before tomorrow night.
And make it nice and logical. Bye.
Tom, you're going to have a speech people will never forget.
Bye.
Tom!
Thanks so very much for helping me.
Oh, that's all right, Di.
"Members of the Forum
Society and other guests,"
"equality is that precious state guaranteed to all citizens by the constitution."
"It is what we cherish above all, along with freedom."
Dinah...
Will you come here a minute, please?
Mr Fletcher's just told us about some... happenings yesterday, that er... sound... fantastic.
He just wanted you to tell us what you can about them.
They're true.
But why didn't you come and tell us?
I just didn't want anybody to know.
Coming on top of all the other troubles I've caused...
..well, I couldn't tell you.
- But you know you can always talk to us about anything.
- I'm so sorry.
Being sorry will not help.
You don't realise what damage you've done to your father.
Just a minute. Now's not the time to mention...
It IS time she got a sense of responsibility.
- She SHOULD know.
- Know what, Momma?
Well, dear, the bishop's retiring.
And your father was mentioned to succeed him.
Before their meeting last night,
George Weil's cousin, who works at the City Clerk's Office...
- Well...
- She saw you and Wade come out of the police station with several suspicious characters.
Because of something I did, you won't nominate Papa for bishop?
That's not within my powers.
The others feel it's a bad reflection on your father.
They postponed the nominations.
Oh, Papa, I feel so awful.
- You'd make such a wonderful bishop.
- That he would. >
I'm very happy just being pastor of St Edmunds.
- I don't know if I'm fitted to be bishop.
- You are.
Oh, you are.
If you ask my opinion, the young lady should be punished.
Aye. Properly punished.
What would you suggest, Dan?
It should not be light. I warn you.
Mm... How about flogging in the public square?
Or ducking in the ducking stool?
Andrew, I counsel ye. Ye cannae take this matter lightly.
I don't, Dan.
But as far as I can see, she hasn't done anything to merit punishment.
The others will take no such-like view of it.
It's your future I'm concerned with, Andrew.
I let the Lord take care of that.
He does a better job of it.
Well, if you'll not work for your own advancement, I cannae help you.
Good day, Andrew.
Goodbye, Dan.
Dinah...
She's on the porch.
Oh, Papa, I feel so awful about what I've done to you.
You haven't done anything to me.
Yes, I have. I'm always causing things like this, somehow.
And other people get hurt. And now you.
I heard what Mr Fletcher said.
He's right. I should be punished.
- For what?
- Well, for...
For being eager to paint?
Maybe it was unwise to wander into that particular district, but then, art has no geography.
But some people think I did wrong.
I'm all mixed up.
Yes, I know you are.
HE CHUCKLES
It's a curious thing, but something like this happened to me once.
I didn't do anything wrong either, though many thought I did.
- But I learned something from it.
- What happened to you?
Well, when I was quite young, I had an ambition.
It... may sound a little odd to you now, but...
I was very sincere about it.
I wanted to be a...
..ballroom dancer.
- Papa, you didn't?!
- Yes, I did.
And I was pretty good, too, if I do say so.
Of course, your grandpa and grandma were unalterably opposed.
Said it was unbecoming and unconventional and forbade me to do it.
Grandpa was running for County
Recorder, but I didn't know that, and I ran off to join a touring act.
Only the nicest hotels, of course, and an occasional theatre.
- How old were you?
I thought at the time it was my destined vocation.
It seemed to me that anything I wanted that badly was meant to be.
Then you DO understand.
Indeed I do.
Well, what happened then?
Oh, I lasted three weeks.
The act... How do they say it?
.folded up, and I went home.
For weeks, I was overwhelmed with guilt, because Grandpa lost the election.
And I thought it was due to my... escapade.
But it wasn't.
He had lost it, anyway.
You know...
I don't think even your mother knows about my brief career as a dancer.
I think it was wonderful of you to go out and do what you wanted, no matter what people thought.
Perhaps it explains where you get some of your... unconventionality.
Now, let's go inside and have breakfast, shall we?
I only wish I were more like the kind of daughter you deserve.
I've never been quite sure what kind of a daughter I deserve, but I do know you're exactly the kind of daughter I WANT.
Tom, sorry I'm late.
I just had an idea for another paragraph at the last minute.
I wish I could have read it at least once.
- Well, good evening, Miss Sheldon.
- Good evening. - Hello, Beehouse.
- Hey, Tom, come on. You're late. You're on first.
- Coming.
Is my tie straight?
Yes.
- I'm sitting with my parents.
- I'll help you find them.
AUDIENCE MEMBERS CHATTER
And now our first speaker, Mr
Thomas Wade of the senior class.
TOM CLEARS THROAT
"Members of the Forum Society and honoured guests,"
"equality is that precious state guaranteed to all citizens by the constitution."
"But now I ask you do we have equality?"
"And I answer we do not."
"I invite you, ladies and gentlemen, to look carefully at one citizen."
"That uncomplaining, faithful servant who gets no wage."
"That helpless creature without rights."
"The American wife."
- The American wife?
- LAUGHTER
SPORADIC LAUGHTER
"A-A-And..."
"And when she is not grudging, what then?"
" 'What then?' I say to you."
That mush don't sound like Tom.
I beg your pardon, Mr Beehouse.
Don't get mad. I just can't believe
Tom ever thought junk like that.
That's merely because you don't know the real Tom.
"It is her lord and master who decrees..."
"Members of the Forum Society and..." No.
LAUGHTER
"how she shall spend that leisure."
"As his vassal. Not a human being with equal rights,"
"but a mere plaything of man."
LAUGHTER
Shhh! Shhh!
Some people have no manners at all.
"Equality."
"Ladies and gentlemen..."
"I laugh."
LAUGHTER
"Pray, do not take MY word for it."
"Who am I but a humble... woman?"
- I mean, man.
- LAUGHTER CONTINUES
RIPPLES OF LAUGHTER
"Let's go to a truly great human being."
"Let me give you his exact words."
HE CLEARS THROAT
"The words of the bard
Alfred Lord Tennyson"
"on the subject of woman's place in marriage."
" 'He will hold thee when his passion shall have spent its novel force."
" 'Something better than his dog.
A little dearer than his horse.'"
Bravo! Bravo!
- Bravo! Bravo!
- "There are two choices open to us."
"Either this evil is ended, or woman herself will arise,"
"in just wrath, to claim her rights."
"Another declaration of independence will be written."
"And... And I do not have to..."
"to be a prophet to tell you..."
"that the first words in that new declaration will be..."
SPORADIC LAUGHTER
" 'Until we...'"
" '..women... stand side by side with men in equal freedom...'"
LAUGHTER
- " '..we will not...'"
- LAUGHTER
" '..share his home or...
- " 'bear his children.'"
- GALES OF LAUGHTER
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE
Just put the chairs against the wall so the old folks can sit down and you young folks can dance.
What did you do it for?
That's all I want to know.
I'm sorry. I forgot to change some of the words.
Forgot? Well, it made me look like a jackass.
You heard them laughing.
Everybody thinks I'm a fool.
- Well done, young man. Congratulations.
- Thanks.
I'm Helen Hatley Hamilton, chairman of the Woman's Suffrage Party.
We could use you. Right spirt and the right words.
Too bad you're not a woman.
- You see?
- Congratulations, Tom. Great speech.
- Thanks.
- Yes, sir. Right spirit and the right words.
Too bad you aren't a man...
May I have this dance?
I'd be delighted, Mr Beehouse.
Hm. I suppose he thought that was funny.
Don't pay any attention.
He's merely uncouth.
It's wonderful, the way you delivered it.
You're still angry? Doesn't it make any difference that I liked it?
Of course. All the difference in the world.
THE BAND PLAYS A ONE-STEP
- Would you like some punch?
- Yes.
I've got to say good night to Aunt Lou and Uncle Emery. I'll be right back.
Can't be too soon for me.
Would you care for a glass of punch?
- Thanks.
- I'll get you one.
Di, I'd like to speak to you.
- Why, of course, Tom.
- Privately. Let's go outside for a minute.
Isn't it beautiful out here tonight?
As a matter of fact, it's rather chilly.
We'll skip that.
Right here's as good a place to talk as any.
Yes, Tom.
What is it?
It's about you and me, Di.
Yes, Tom?
I'm not satisfied with this relationship.
It's got to change.
How, Tom?
I just don't want to be seen with you any more.
It isn't only tonight's speech.
It's everything.
The time in grammar school and I got in a fight and lost two teeth.
The time I lost my chance to be on the football team when you got me into a row with the coach's sister.
- The time you talked me into buying a course...
- But, Tom, I...
And the time you lost me my job.
And all your other ideas.
Let's just call it quits, because I don't want anything more to happen.
Especially now, with
Bernice and everything.
Please remember that, will you?
Yes, Tom.
Thank you.
- Excuse me.
- Certainly, Tom.
"Artist's Life" by Johann Strauss
Di.
Hello, Papa.
Isn't it a little cold out here, dear?
Yes. That's what Tom said.
The moon's certainly pretty, shining on the water.
It only hides the sadness underneath.
Life can be like that sometimes.
Beautiful and bright on the surface, still and cold underneath.
Yes, it can.
That's a lovely waltz they're playing.
So gay.
Yes, gay if one's gay... sad if one's sad.
Strauss, isn't it?
That's why it's sad.
Why is that, dear?
It was written long ago, about something that's lost for ever.
Something rare and beautiful, that can never be again.
Just a deep pain at the memory of the lost past.
We should never mourn for the past.
Sometimes, it's more beautiful than the future.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Grand Waltz Contest!
WALTZ BEGINS
You know, I haven't danced in ten years.
But I'll bet I can still manage to stay off my partner's toes.
Would you come inside and dance this one with me?
Of course, Papa.
Papa, how do you get to be a missionary?
I, er...
I'll tell you inside.
"Gold And Silver Waltz" by Lehar
Gee, Pa's a good dancer!
Yes. Oh, yes!
Papa, we've won!
What I wonder is, why would Tom be mad at me?
- I - can't explain the vagaries of Mr Wade's disposition.
Gee whiz, don't get your dander up!
I'm not perturbed, if that's what you mean by that vulgar slang.
- No! Put him here! He'll choke!
- That's just silly.
You want to kill the guppy?
- He's my guppy.
- He is not!
- You don't know beans about guppies.
- I do! I'll hold him if I want.
He'll die if you hold him.
- There! See?
- He will not.
He knows me... >
He will so! >
- Children, please.
- FABRIC RIPS
< He's different from a fish.
- A guppy IS a fish. - I told you...
- Let go of my guppy!
All right.
< All right. But you wait. Just you wait.
Sorry. Is my working on my sermon in any way disturbing any of you?
We're sorry, Andrew, dear.
What's the sermon about, Pa?
The power of silence.
Proverbs 17, verse 28.
"Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise"
"and he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding."
TROMBONE BURPS
Momma, I'm going out for a little walk.
Fresh air's good for a person before bedtime. I'll sleep better.
Get your hands off that...
Let's please have no more talking.
Quiet in the court! The monkey's going to speak!
Speak, monkey! Speak!
- Ahem. - BOTH CHILDREN:
- You're the monkey!
I was clearing my throat!
Oh, it's you.
Mr Wade, it's very important that I speak with you privately.
Look, Dinah, I'm very busy.
There's nothing to stop you from talking.
Mr Steuben doesn't allow employees to talk during working hours.
Mr Steuben, may I talk to Tom?
It's very urgent.
- Why, sure. Oh, Tom?
- Yes, Mr Steuben?
This young lady wants to talk to you.
I won't get this automobile done if I do, Mr Steuben.
You let me worry about that, Tom.
- Yes, Mr Steuben.
- Thank you.
- Well?
- Mr Wade, since you desire to terminate our relationship,
I feel the need to clear up the 50 I owe you.
I don't have to have that.
I feel the sooner it's settled, the happier we'll be.
After all, 50 is a lot of money.
Well, now that you mention it, I could use it.
Say, I... I certainly could.
Bernice's birthday is coming up, you know.
You'll certainly have your money.
- Have you got it?
- I... have a way to get it.
Unfortunately, I need your co-operation.
But you will have funds to lavish gifts upon your continental friend.
- Where are you going to get 50?
- Painting.
- Huh!
- If you'll deign to read it, you'll see it's a competition.
There are three prizes of 50.
I intend to win one of them with a portrait of you as The Spirit Of Labor.
Are you bats?!
You want to get Bernice that gift, don't you?
Not that way, I don't.
I think that's foolish, Tom, since I'm doing this for you.
- You can forget it. I won't be a laughing stock again.
- All I need you for is to pose.
The face won't look like you, if that's what you're afraid of.
It won't?
Heavens, no!
A person would be vain to imagine their face personifying all labour!
I'm going to paint in the face of an ideal man half angel, half Hercules.
No.
Oh, Tom...
Papa's lending me the greenhouse as a studio. It's completely secluded.
- So nobody would see me pose?
- No! You can put on your costume...
Costume?
..and go right over without a soul seeing.
What kind of a costume?
Well, I... I haven't decided exactly what.
After all, you have to typify labour in an idealised way.
Atlas holding the world up... Giants trampling wine from grapes...
Gulliver... Goliath...
It has to be filled with strength.
HEN CLUCKS
"Velocity of a point is the..."
"time arc at which it is traversing distance."
Phew. This hammer isn't exactly made of feathers, Di.
I'll be done in a few minutes.
HENS CLUCK
Shoo! Go away! Get off there! Go on!
All you need is a little patience.
Patience? In this pose and costume?
- Why, if anybody saw me like this...
- Oh, Tom, don't be a prude.
An artist is above that. I'm not aware of you as a person.
To me, you're merely light and shadow.
- How does a swimsuit fit in with Hercules?
- Wait till it's finished.
Tom! Oh, Tom!
I have to go, Di. Mr Steuben wants me in the garage.
Tom, two more minutes and I'll be finished for the day. Please, Tom.
- I haven't got all day to waste.
- He'll be here in a minute. TOM!
Coming. I've got to go, Di.
Just one more minute.
- Hello, Mrs Sheldon!
- Bernice, dear! How are you?
Is that the new frock your mother told me about?
Just a little thing Momma made up.
It's darling. Did you come to show Dinah?
She's in the greenhouse.
I know she'll be pleased you came to show it to her.
When do I get to see the painting?
It would be very bad luck for you to see it before I exhibit it.
- < Dinah?
- It's Bernice!
If she sees me in here like this...
- < Dinah?
- Uh... just a minute, Bernice.
Hide! Not there. Over there.
- < Dinah?
- HENS CLUCK
What are you doing in this...?
Oh, painting!
Just dabbing. Papa lets me use it for a studio. It's so secluded.
Who can paint with all that racket?
- WILD CLUCKING - Oh, my mind's on higher things. Isn't that a new dress?
Yes! Don't you love the neckline?
They're two inches lower in Paris.
- You know Paris. Tout a la mode.
- Oh, yes.
Tom will like it.
A girl shouldn't wear anything her fiance doesn't care for.
Tom has very decided ideas. But I don't mind him being strait-laced.
No... I mean, yes. Why should you?
Bernice, I've been wanting to ask, can you show me how you do that French hairstyle?
- I don't mind.
- There's a double mirror upstairs.
- I'm not sure you've got the face.
- It's awfully sweet of you, anyway.
All right. Now you can squawk.
OFFENDED CLUCKING
..in a French roll. Then you take the sides...
Oh, you've finished already?
How did the painting go?
Oh, er... just splendidly, Momma.
Lily? May I see you a moment?
­ DOOR CLOSES
Of course, Andrew.
Lily, Mr Fletcher was just here...
..on a matter of great importance.
- Has Dinah done something again?
- No.
Oh, thank goodness.
No, it's... more important than that.
What is it?
It's something... as you know, Lily...
I've never sought.
Andrew!
Dan told me I'm to be nominated for bishop.
That's wonderful!
Oh, I'm so glad, Andrew dear!
I know I should be very happy, but...
Aren't you?
- Yes, of course, but...
- But what, dear?
I...
I'm not sure I'm worthy of it.
Why, of course you are!
I feel very humble, Lily, touched, that the people of St Edmunds think I am.
But I'm not sure that my calling is to be a bishop.
Before I told you, I went over to the church to pray.
I wanted guidance to be told whether I had a right to be nominated.
I knew, of course, that as in all things, that guidance would come from above.
It's because you do think this that you're right for it.
Oh, there'll be other nominees.
Dr Bristow, for one.
I have great affection and respect for him.
He's a truly fine man.
And so are YOU, Andrew.
And I'm a very lucky man. I know that.
- May I tell the children?
- I'm not elected yet.
Oh, nonsense!
Children! Oh, children?
Come downstairs! Your father's got news for you!
What's up, Momma?
Momma, what is it?
Your father's been nominated for bishop of the diocese of Maryland!
Pa, this is a very important day to us.
Congratulations, sir.
I'm sure we'll all behave as a bishop's family should behave.
And I know the Bishop of Maryland will have the best left hook in the US.
Now, wait a minute...
I'm not even nominated, let alone elected.
- There are other candidates.
- Oh, Papa. They can't elect anyone but you.
I'm not so sure. Lily, are ice cream and cake in order?
- Definitely!
- Let's go get them!
Pa, I'd like to ask a question.
What is it?
- Does a bishop make more money?
- Mark!
ALL LAUGH
- Yes?
- I'd like to enter a painting in the exhibition.
- For whom are you delivering? Mr...?
- Not Mister. Miss.
- Miss?
- Yes. Miss Dinah Sheldon. I'm not delivering it. I'm entering it.
Entering it? We've never had a female entrant.
- The rules don't say women can't enter.
- My dear young lady, no woman wrote a great opera, built a great building or painted a great painting.
No woman ever voted, but we will.
You have no right to bar my work.
The rules admit everybody. As you'd know if you'd read them.
Page seven.
Thank you.
You're right!
Then, here's my entry.
Well! Quite good!
Thank you. There's just one thing.
- The painter's name is secret, isn't it?
- Oh, yes, indeed.
Each painting is unsigned, with a number fixed to the frame.
We keep the names separately, so the judges aren't influenced.
Your number is 87. Your name will be undisclosed.
I'd like to remain anonymous after judging, too.
- Even if you should win?
- Yes, even if I should win.
Yes, I... think I see what you mean, Miss Sheldon.
- Bernice! Come and see 87!
- What for?
I hate to say anything, but it may change your mind about some things.
What things, child?
Come and see, Mrs Eckert! If you have smelling salts, lend them to Bernice!
SHE GASPS
- It's Tom! Your Tom!
- Yes, it's Tom!
He must have posed for it.
Why, that's Tom Wade!
In THAT costume!
- I wonder who painted it.
- I'll tell you! Dinah Sheldon!
- Dr Sheldon's daughter!
- Oh, how dreadful!
Your fiance posed like that before a woman?
So that's what she was doing in that secret studio!
That's why she was so odd about it.
She liked it because it was SECLUDED, she said.
Too secluded, I'd say.
I wonder what else went on.
- I've heard about artists.
- I knew one once.
Where did you know an artist?
You never told me.
I must get this poor child home.
You speak to Tom Wade.
Dinah Sheldon, the hussy!
HECTIC MUSIC
- Hello.
- Good afternoon, Dinah.
Dinah!
How's Tom Wade?
- Shhh! Stop it!
- Poor Dr Sheldon.
Why did you do it? That's all I want to know.
- Why did you put my face on it? You said you wouldn't.
- I know.
I tried all kinds of things, but they were wrong.
I painted and painted, and suddenly
I saw that without meaning to,
I'd put in your face.
And then it WAS right.
- I didn't try to do it. It just happened.
- It sure did.
They... gave me a prize. I can pay you back the 50 now.
Thanks.
I'll need it.
I just lost my job on account of... things.
- Oh, Tom!
- Bernice is mad at me. So's my Aunt Ella.
I wish I could change things.
It's too late now.
I don't know why, but taking this makes me feel like Benedict Arnold or somebody.
- If you'd disciplined her, it wouldn't have happened.
- Perhaps, Dan.
But the damage is done. Good day.
- Afternoon, Miss Wade.
- Afternoon, Mr Fletcher.
Glad to see you, Ella. Come on in.
- Dr Sheldon, this whole thing is just terrible.
- Let's sit down and talk about it.
Talking won't do a smidgen of good.
I feel something just has to be done about it, that's all.
Goodness knows what.
- How's Tom?
- He's very upset. You know what they're saying.
- Yes.
- He had to hit two of his friends this afternoon.
Oh, yes, it's come to that.
Breaking up his friendships, on top of everything.
I'm sorry to hear that.
You'd be a mite sorrier to hear what they say about YOU.
And your wife. And how Dinah was raised.
Not that I'd listen, but I could tell you who's saying those mean things.
Ella, I don't want to know. They don't know what they're doing.
KNOCK AT DOOR Andrew, dear... Excuse me, Ella... may I see you a moment?
Certainly, dear. I'll be right back, Ella.
Come in here a minute, dear.
Andrew, there are two more people to see you.
- Same thing?
- Yes, Mr Eckert and a man from the Post for a picture of Dinah.
- That's out of the question.
- You'll have to talk to him.
It's a tempest in a teapot.
- I'll get rid of them.
- DOORBELL
Now there's someone else.
Andrew, she can go to your sister
Carrie in Pittsburgh for a few months.
- What good would it do?
- She'd have a chance to think, and we can sort things out.
If anything's to be sorted out, the place is here.
They'll be dreadful to her.
I'm afraid you're right, Lily.
But what affects Dinah affects us too.
- I'd rather face it here than send her away. It isn't Dinah's fault.
- I don't know, Andrew.
I can't help feeling it must be partly her fault.
- Ordinary well-mannered people don't get into things like this.
- Lily.
Ordinary well-mannered people get into all kinds of trouble.
Oh!
Bernice? I've been looking for you.
You'd no need to hang up the phone.
There's no point you talking to me, Tom Wade.
- Won't you let me explain?
- Some things explain themselves, Mr Wade.
I love this new flavour, Fred.
Have another! Two sodas, please. Pistachio.
Bernice, you're mistaken about this.
If that's so, you wouldn't be seen talking with Dinah Sheldon.
Mrs Weir told Momma she was hanging out washing, and you walked right back into that greenhouse and talked to her, as big as life!
What's wrong with that?
After what she did?! That creature!
She is not a creature. You're taking a wrong attitude.
Mr Wade, to whom do you think you're speaking to?
- I'm telling you, Di did nothing wrong.
- She's nothing but a... a... things everybody's saying.
- Do you believe them?
- Where there's smoke there's fire, Mother says.
- That's the most unfair thing I ever heard.
- Everyone can't be wrong.
If I were willing not to ask questions, the least you can do is promise not to speak to that hussy again.
Bernice, if you were a man
I'd punch you in the nose.
Fred!
Uh... I'M a man.
Man, huh?
He's fainted!
- Lily?
- Yes?
Lily, where are you?
I'm up here, dear. What is it?
You'll have to change your Young
People's Meeting to another day.
The furnace man's working in the hall on Tuesday.
Monday, then.
Hey, what's going on here?
Dinah's going to visit your sister Carrie till summer.
- I told you how I feel about that.
- Papa, please.
We talked it over, and Momma's right.
It's best for me to go away for a few months.
I've done nothing but cause trouble for you.
I said before, it's a family responsibility. We'll fight it out.
There's nothing to fight.
It's a matter of getting people to forget.
They won't if Dinah's here.
- Forget what? The evil their own minds invented?
- No, dear.
The situation that could affect your whole future.
Lily dear, if God wants me to be bishop, I will be.
It's more urgent to recognise gossip for what it is.
Andrew, dear, you know how much good you could do.
It means so much to everyone.
PHONE RINGS
I talked with Mr Fletcher and some of the vestrymen.
We agree it's the wisest thing.
- Call for Pa, about the job for Hank Miller.
Right, Gene.
- Lily...
- Answer that and leave this to me, dear.
I know I'm right, Andrew.
I won't stand still while you lose the chance to be bishop of this diocese.
- ­ - Pa, are you coming?
- Please, dear.
- ­ - Shall I hang up, Pa?
No, I'm coming.
HE CLEARS THROAT
- I wish - I
- was going away!
I don't.
Tom?
I just want to say goodbye.
I thought it all over, Di, and
I know it wasn't your fault.
Thank you.
I'm sorry they're sending you away.
Perhaps it's as well if we don't see each other. I've caused you enough grief.
I don't hold anything against you, Di.
- Dinah! Come on, dear. We're ready.
- All right, Momma. I'm coming.
Perhaps we should say goodbye here...
..in the darkness.
It would be best for you not to be seen with me now.
I don't feel that way. I'm not ashamed to be seen with you.
No, it... it's better this way.
You know what they're saying.
The world can be very unkind to a woman alone.
Well, we'll just show them.
I'll ride to the station with you.
We'll let everybody see us.
You behave, and mind your father.
- Yes, Momma.
- Yes, Momma.
Tom's going to see me off.
Oh? Well, dear, I wonder if...
Mrs Sheldon, I want you to know, I'd be proud to ride in your buggy.
- Well, yes, but it might not...
- Good idea, Lily. Go along, Tom.
Yes, sir. I'll put your bag in the buggy.
- Take care, dear. I'll be back tomorrow.
- I don't like you travelling alone.
- You can't leave, with a service tomorrow and meetings tonight.
- No, I can't.
- Goodbye, dear.
- Goodbye.
Papa, I've been thinking.
It's my ambition that's caused all the trouble for everybody.
So I've come to a decision.
I'm giving up painting.
Odd you should say that.
Why, Papa?
I wondered, when you're in Pittsburgh,
I've never had a picture of your Aunt Carrie.
I, er... had Jean put your paints in the buggy.
I thought if you didn't mind, you could do that for me.
If YOU want me to.
- Just see that it's a good one.
- Oh, I will!
Goodbye, dear.
Bye, Papa.
- Bye, Momma! Bye!
- Bye, Dinah!
- Bye, Dinah!
- Bye, Momma! Bye!

Out of our way! Out of our way!
- Ha, ha! You're not going anywhere!
- On to City Hall! Teddy Roosevelt's speaking tonight! We'll tell him!
- You'll never get to City Hall.
- Go on home, you silly hens.
- Why don't they let them through? They can see the President.
- It's not our business.
Some among you must want to hear the voice of justice for women.
To you I say... DERISIVE SHOUTS
Oh, that's mean! They

Momma, you're right.
Somebody's got to make a path for them.
Giddy-up, George.
SHOUTS AND SCREAMS
- HORSE NEIGHS - You all right?
- Where are we?
Wait! That's my new parasol!
HORSE NEIGHS
CRASH!
I'm sick and tired of submitting to this gossip, allowing it to grow and disrupt my parish, my work and my family.
I don't intend to let it go on happening.
I should never have allowed
Lily and Dinah to leave.
I'm not going to let this break up my family.
I'm going down to the station, and pray they haven't left.
No daughter of mine is being sent away because of lying tongues.
PHONE RINGS
Hello?
Yes. Yes.
It...
Yes! Yes, I'll be right down!
Fortunately, they... haven't left yet.
- Andrew... your family?
- Yes, Dan. They were arrested.
Over there, Reverend. If they're yours, we'll release them.
Yes, they're mine.
- Lily, dear, are you all right?
- Yes, dear. Perfectly. We all are.
Er... what about your eye?
It's nothing.
Someone hit me, that's all.
It's a beauty, isn't it?
Well, let's go home.
We'll want to get something on these bruises.
Keep your guard up?
Andrew, I want you to know we did nothing wrong. It wasn't our fault.
Yes, I know, dear. Ordinary, well-mannered people just... don't get into things like this.
ORGAN PLAYS
Andrew, I know you've changed your subject for the sermon.
Have you prepared another?
No. But...
I HAVE been thinking about it for quite a while.
Andrew, concerning your, er, ruminations, my advice would be to make no mention of the matter last week.
You're all very certain that if I forget it, everyone will.
Time takes care of everything.
- The less I make of this, the more I protect my opportunity to be bishop.
- Aye!
Let's not be ashamed of mentioning that it's something of concern to you and to your friends here.
I appreciate that, too.
Perhaps, Andrew, you'd give us some information concerning your, er... ruminations?
Well, of course, if I weren't concerned about becoming bishop... and if I weren't willing to just forget the whole thing...
..I would have a few things to say.
A few points to make.
To begin with, I would proudly contend that my family fought for the rights of individuals.
I'd point out that with elections...
I might add it's shameful for members of my own congregation to indulge in petty gossip... about my daughter and the young man, both of whom are above reproach.
Andrew, I implore you...
Just a moment. I am not finished... with my ruminations.
I would also say that I, too, am in error.
I have not taught my people well if this sort of thing can happen in my parish.
I would also confess I was willing to submit to this gossip by agreeing to let my daughter leave town.
I was willing to submit because I was concerned about my possible election as bishop.
Andrew, you cannae dare say such things!
You know, as I divulge these ruminations to you,
I am more and more convinced that
I shall speak of these things.
- Don't you realise...?
- If what my family and I did is wrong,
I do not deserve to be bishop.
The only important thing is, I must serve my congregation.
The first obligation of a minister is to serve.
I can only serve by speaking the truth.
You cannae mean to say this in the pulpit?!
- Yes, Dan.
- < You can't possibly!
I may even think of more.
I shall probably say something about how we use words like meanness, intolerance and bigotry, but somehow always in connection with others, never with ourselves.
What's happened in the last few days, this gossip, is mean, intolerant and bigoted.
If it isn't pointed out and recognised for what it is, who can say what cruel thing it may lead to tomorrow?
There's no measure of a lie.
It's... neither little nor big.
It's always a lie.
I don't want to see any man judge his neighbour.
That we must always leave to God.
You may be more comfortable, Dan, in here.
No. I'll go. Right or wrong, Andrew,
I want to be in wi' you at the finish.
Instead of starting with hymn
127, which was posted for today, we will sing hymn 493.
It begins, "O brother man",
"hold to thy heart thy brother."
ORGAN PLAYS
Well, has no-one in this family anything to say?
Why the unusual silence?
It's your sermon, Andrew.
It made us so proud.
I want you to know that I...
I...
SHE SOBS
Papa?
That was the finest...
That really was the finest...
SHE SOBS
What they wanted to tell you, Father, was...
Well, you were so...
So... I mean...
What have you got to say?
- I'm hungry.
- And so am I.
Sensible people.
Can I help?
No.
Oh, Tom, thanks for everything you've done.
You've been wonderful.
No. YOU'RE wonderful.
I didn't have sense enough to see it till now, but, Di...
Yes, Tom?
I do know it now. You are.
I...
I... I guess I'd better go back.
Please come in with me.
- Sure, Di.
- Let me help you.
Oh, no.
Di, there's just one thing
I want to ask of you.
Please, don't ever help me!
< WILD CRY
Andrew! I've got something...
Tom, do you suppose...?
Must a man wait all the day when he has important news?
Andrew, they've elected you bishop.
ALL GASP I'm very proud and very happy to be the first to congratulate you.
Hae you no word for us, Andrew, when I bring you such good tidings?
Hae you nothing to say?
Will ye hae white meat or dark, Dan?
Sit down. Sit down. Bring up another chair.
Subtitles by Ericsson
Here in Kentucky is the Bluegrass Country, where champions are born...
...black, bay, and chestnut.
Glorious creatures...
...born to run and to keep on running...
...when sinew and bone have given their all...
...and there is nothing but heart left to carry them on.
Such are the thoroughbreds...
...and it is of these that our story tells of one in particular...
...and the love and faith of a man in that horse.
It starts here at Millford Farms, not far from Paris, Kentucky.
Watch your step.
Watch your step, sir.
This is your destination. This is Paris.
-Paris?
-Yes, sir.
The Millford Farm is just a few miles south of town.
-Miles?
-Kilometers in your country, sir.
We've got miles in our country too.
-Here you are.
-Thank you, miss. Good luck.
You gave him a shilling.
A quarter, Uncle Shawn.
We're in the U.S.A.
Now, why do you suppose the U.S.A. has to call a little dot on the map like this Paris?
Maybe because it's so different.
Well, it's a good enough reason, l suppose.
Surely, Mr. Millford must have sent somebody to meet us. ls...? ls you folks...?
Could you tell me if there's a Mr. Millford, the horse breeder, anywhere about? l don't rightly know what you said, missy. l'm here to pick up some folks that's going to Mr. Millford's farm. A couple foreigners.
What language is this strange person talking, Maggie? l'm not sure.
Don't y'all speak English?
Yes, we do. Now, you listen carefully.
This is Mr. Shawn O'Hara. l'm his niece.
We've come all the way from lreland.
Mr. Millford's expecting us. Mr. Millford!
Yes'm. Yes'm, you is which l'm looking for. l'm Mr. Millford's boy.
His boy, you say?
Yes, sir. Murphy's the name, sir.
Murphy--
Did he say ''Murphy''? l think he did, Uncle Shawn.
Did you say Murphy?
Yes, miss. Murphy.
They calls me Walkin' Murphy.
Walkin' Murphy?
Yes'm. Most of us Murphys down here just sit. l walk.
-Well, that's fine.
-Murphy!
What part of lreland are you from? l don't rightly know, sir.
Us Murphys down here only got a casual acquaintance with the lrish.
Come on, Murphy, take us to Mr. Millford. l almost forgot what Mr. Millford said.
Welcome to Kentucky, the Bluegrass state.
Thanks, Murphy. Start walking.
Yes'm.
Paris, Murphy, Bluegrass.... lt's a strange, new world, Uncle Shawn.
-How are you, sir?
-Welcome to Millford Farms, Shawn O'Hara.
Thank you, sir. You're Mr. Millford?
Yes. And this must be your niece,
Margaret. l'm delighted, my dear.
Must've been a black day in lreland when you left.
There's a little of the lrish in you, l'm thinking.
There's a little in all of us, isn't there? l've been wondering about that.
Margaret, we've made arrangements for you...
...to continue your studies as a nurse in our hospital. l can't thank you enough for that.
Well, you can thank me by spending all your spare time right here on the farm.
-Let me show you to your quarters.
-lf it's okay...
...l'd rather lay me eyes on some of the thoroughbreds first, yearlings preferred.
Uncle Shawn's a little homesick.
Well, we'll fix that up right away.
Come with me.
Well, there they are, Shawn.
The prettiest sight in the world.
See anything here you like?
Hello, George.
Shawn, this is George Carson, my head trainer. George, this is Shawn O'Hara.
-l've heard of George.
-l've heard of Shawn.
-And this is Margaret, Shawn's niece.
-A real pleasure, miss.
Shawn's going to be a great help to us. l'll believe that when l see it. l hear you're a magician, Shawn.
You can look at a yearling and tell like that whether he'll turn out champion or cow.
You exaggerate my abilities, George, but--
But that's why you're here, Shawn.
Oh, brother! Why, we can't even tell for sure when they're 2-year-olds.
Even after testing them against each other...
...we let a future winner go to the sales.
Perhaps you've let too many winners get away, Mr. Carson.
Now, Maggie, naturally George is doubtful. lf it's proof you want, Mr. Carson, listen to this: ln all the years that Uncle Shawn trained for Lord and Lady Maitland in lreland...
...devil a colt that turned the trick was sold by them.
All right, Miss Margaret.
Let me in on the secret, will you?
Of course. 'Tis simple.
When it comes to a thoroughbred horse,
Uncle Shawn is fey.
Fey? What's that? lt has to do with the little people:
Elves, gnomes, fairies.
So we're going to have the fairies pick our horses for us.
Well, l give up. You can have my resignation whenever you want it.
Of course not. Don't fly off the handle.
You and Shawn will make a great team.
Well, if he's so all-fired fey or whatever it is...
...l don't see why Lord and Lady Maitland didn't keep him under lock and key.
You've a perfect right to know why l came to America. l'm through training jumping horses for the rest of me days.
You remember the last Grand National at Aintree?
Sure, l remember. l saddled the favorite, Blackwatch.
And the jockey was Danny,
Margaret's brother.
He was a great jockey and a great lad.
Blackwatch was the best horse, and Danny the best jockey that day.
We were the favorite.
We had it won handily.
He was running easily. lt was just as though Danny were taking that grand, strong horse for a gallop.
Sure there were jumps, and Blackwatch flew over them.
Then came the last jump.
Who knows what happened?
Not l, not anyone.
They failed to clear it, and Blackwatch was down with Danny under.
Both boy and horse were done for when l got there.
For 30 years, l've been training jumpers in the so-called sport of kings.
But that day at Aintree it came to me...
...that when you kill a lovely lad and break the back of a fine horse...
...the devil's in it, and not kings.
A large part of me heart is in Danny's grave.
And as for Margaret, l only hope the time will come...
...when the blackness of that day will be lifted from her soul.
We'll do all we can to help you both, Shawn.
Thank you, sir.
Have you got a carrot, Libby?
A nice big one.
Carrot? Carrot? There you go, carrot. l never saw a man eat so many carrots in my life.
Great thing, a carrot. Goes straight to the legs. Puts speed in them. l don't see you getting around so extra spry.
Uncle Shawn?
There's your best gal.
Uncle Shawn?
Hello, Margaret.
So here you are. lt's nice to be home again.
Darling, l'm spending the night. l've all tomorrow off.
That'll be fine. Tell me, how is things at the hospital?
Not bad. The head nurse gave me a smile and a pat on the arm this morning.
-Hello, Miss Margaret.
-Hello, Libby.
-Give the girl a cup of tea, Libby.
-Yes, sir.
-l'll be back in a jiffy.
-Where are you off to?
Just out for a bit. l might have known. The moon's full.
Up to your old tricks? l'm going with you this time. l'm only going to look at the yearlings, and the grass is swimming with dew.
And do you look at the yearlings through this?
You'll not get away from me, no matter what.
All right. Come along if you must, but don't blame me if you're soaked to the knees.
Now, then, Miss Curiosity...
...out there are the yearlings cropping bluegrass. Look.
They like it fine, but a colt likes a carrot beyond all else.
Well, there's a grand big one.
The youngsters know by now when l call the first one to the fence gets the prize.
Look sharp. They're running free as air with all the speed they've got.
Watch, watch, watch.
Colt! Colt! Colt!
Colt! Colt! Colt!
Uncle Shawn, this one beat them all.
That's not the best of it.
He'll run the distance.
How do know that when he only came a furlong?
Did you notice how solid his hooves hit the ground?
Sprinters run high-headed and light-footed. lt's a frolic with them. lt's a business with this little lad, a business, and he gives it his all.
He is small, a full hand below the rest.
Sure, he's small in the body, but big in the heart.
What do they call him?
Seabiscuit. You'll be hearing the name someday.
Come on. We'll get back to the house.
Uncle Shawn, why do you do this under the moon?
-You can see better in the day.
-Yes, and so could everybody else. ln no time, no one would believe l had the seeing eye when it came to a colt. l'd be just an old fool who'd stumbled on a few things.
Why, you old fox.
Call me that if you like, Maggie, but here's a piece of advice.
When it comes to a man you might think of for your own...
...don't let him see how simple you are.
Wrap yourself in a little mystery.
-Uncle Shawn?
-Yes, me darling?
Sure a girl knows that when she's in short dresses.
Gallant Lad, nice, quiet colt, handles good.
-Yes, sir.
-Got lots of daylight under him.
Quite a ways from his withers to his hips.
How's he bred?
Gallant Man and Kind Lady.
That should be a good nick.
What do you say?
They gotta be shorter in the back. l'd let him go.
-Shawn?
-l go around with George.
Shipping paddock.
-What's this?
-Hurry On by Push On, dam, Wedding Ring.
Wants more girth, high shouldered.
What do you say, George?
He wouldn't like a distance.
Turn him loose.
And Shawn?
No, he'll be through at 6 furlongs, but he'll run that good and fast.
He should win some cheap races for you. l'd not let him go.
-Put him back in the barn.
-Yes, sir.
What's this one?
Sweet Sue by Time Supply, dam, Mary Ellen.
She's sweet, all right.
Short back, good bone, nice all over.
-Agree, George?
-Yeah, a good solid chunk. l like her.
And you, Shawn? l hate to be the odd man, but l wouldn't give a shilling for her. ls that so? Why not?
She'll be a cow. No fire in her.
As soon run last as first. l see.
Shipping paddock.
-Come on, boy.
-Well, that does it.
You don't need me around here.
-Easy. Keep your shirt on.
-Who's the head trainer, him or me?
Shawn made a great record in lreland judging yearlings. That's why he's here.
But this isn't lreland. lt's Kentucky.
He doesn't know how these colts are bred.
He's right there, sir. l'm not straight yet on American bloodlines.
Some colts' souls say,
''After you, mister,'' ...
...when a better-hearted one looks them in the eye, no matter how they're bred.
So what? We can't carry 50 yearlings...
...to where we can put the acid test on them with boys up.
We make a profit on this farm.
We stay out of the red.
That is, for the 1 0 years l've been here.
And l picked the colts we kept. l know. l know. You judge the next two or three, George.
-Shawn and l won't open our heads.
-l'll not so much as respond. l give me word.
Come on with him.
And that was bred here?
What is it?
Seabiscuit by Hard Tack, out of Swing On.
-He's always been kind of runty.
-Runty's right.
Look at those knees, big enough for a 3-year-old.
Deciding about this one won't strain you.
-Get him to the shipping paddock, quick.
-One minute. l gave me word, and you can call me what you like.
But l'm going to have me say. l'm begging you, l'm praying you...
...don't let this little man go.
Well, can you beat that?
Boss, l stood for a lot here this morning.
But if you keep this runty, big-kneed thing on the say of this lrish expert...
...l'm getting off the place.
You don't know what you're saying. l'll leave, and gladly, to trouble you no more on one condition.
Give this colt a chance to show you what he can do.
Nobody's going to leave over one yearling.
Shawn, l promised George, and l'm keeping my word.
Shipping paddock.
The day will come when you'd hold your head higher and breathe deep to be his owner.
You die hard, don't you, Shawn? l doubt if it's hard enough.
Hi, there.
Good morning.
Yeah, it is, isn't it? Remember me? l think l've seen you. l forget just where. l was with the exercise boys when
Mr. Millford was showing you the place.
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, boy. lf you're an exercise boy, better get to work. He's fretting to be out there.
Exercise boy?
Listen, sister, l'm Ted Knowles.
Should that impress me?
You never heard the name?
Not that l recall.
Well, look, l've gotta work this thing. l'll be right back. Come on, boy. Come on.
Little five, be good to me.
Fever, destroy the South.
Could you lads tell me something now?
-Who is Ted Knowles?
-Ted Knowles?
Yonder he goes on War Chief.
Yes, l know, but what does he do?
Does he work here?
Work here? He's top jock.
Yeah, he wins more big stakes than he's got freckles.
Thanks.
Hey, Lightning, come get him.
Were you giving me the runaround a few minutes ago?
-The what?
-The runaround, the business.
-What strange language are you talking?
-l forgot. You're fresh out of lreland.
And the top of the morning to you.
Not bad, huh?
Bad enough to start a fight in lreland.
You know, you've got an accent just like old Shawn.
On you l like it.
My, you're a fast starter.
That's my reputation.
Then you did know all along who l was. l found out. lnterested? l should've known you were a jockey.
That's all right. l can't expect you to know everything before we've even got started.
Jockeys have sort of a special something about them that's easy to tell.
The bandy legs?
'Tis more a secret thing of the spirit.
Say, what's your name?
-Margaret O'Hara.
-Margaret. l'll tell you what. l'll win my first race this year for you...
...if you promise to be there with maybe a two-spot on his nose.
No. Never.
Why not? lt would be bringing back a black memory to torment me.
Well, now who's talking crazy?
Margaret, l've gotta work a couple more horses. Where can l see you again soon?
No place at all.
No place at all?
Am l that hard on the eyes?
You're not hard on the eyes at all, Ted, but you're a jockey.
Goodbye.
-Hello, Mr. O'Hara.
-Hello.
-ls this the lot we're letting go?
-'Tis worse luck.
The vans will soon be loaded and ready to go.
Say, l think your niece is swell.
You can't start an argument with me that way, me boy. l just wanna know if it'd be okay by you if l dated her.
And if it shouldn't be okay by me l'm thinking you'd start an argument.
Well, l thought maybe you had it in for jocks too.
Darned if l don't think l'd stand a better chance with her if l were a stable boy.
She's a mystery, that Margaret is.
Maybe you could put in a good word for me.
Being the kind of man you are, l've an idea you can solve that mystery without my help.
However, l might be willing to put in a word here and there...
...if you do me a bit of a favor in return.
-Anything you say.
-l'll not say much.
Just buy that colt there, Seabiscuit.
-Me, buy that little squirt? What for?
-l like him.
But he hasn't got a chance.
George doesn't think so either. l think you're both mistaken.
Why don't you buy him yourself?
No, no. So long as l train for other people, l'll never race one of me own. l might be tempted to give him special consideration. l feel the same way myself.
Hello, Uncle Shawn. l'm catching the next bus. l've had a wonderful time.
Maggie, darling, before you go, l want you to do something for me.
-What is it, Uncle Shawn?
-l want you to turn your charm on Ted...
...and do all you can to persuade him to buy Seabiscuit. l'd do anything l can for you,
Uncle Shawn, but that.
No, you'll do that too. You know how l feel about Seabiscuit. Go on, now.
Hello, Ted.
Hello, Margaret.
That uncle of yours is all wet.
That colt, Seabiscuit, is a washout.
-Anybody can see that.
-Uncle Shawn sees more than anyone else.
He has a second sight. lf he says
Seabiscuit's good, there's no other answer. lnside information. ls that it?
Yes, from the little people.
The who?
The lrish that are fey talk to the little people and get inside information.
-lt never fails.
-How about you?
You talk to that bunch too?
Sometimes. They told me about you.
No kidding.
But nobody could make me buy a colt like that one.
Not even me, Ted?
Hello, son. What's on your mind?
Sir, l've taken a fancy to one of the colts you're shipping to the sales. Seabiscuit. lf you put a price on him, l'd like to buy him.
-You'd like to buy him?
-Yes, sir.
Give it to me straight, Ted.
Who put you up to this?
You won't make trouble for anyone if l tell you?
No, my word for it.
Well, O'Hara held him out of the shipment. l've promised a certain party to buy him.
O'Hara?
No, his niece.
She knows a lot about horses. l see.
To begin with, you know a jockey can't race his own horse in this country.
Well, no, but l can have him trained.
And then what?
Well, if he was any good, l could sell him. l'd sell him to you.
Now, that's a thought.
Right back where we started from.
No, Ted. Here's the best way out of it. l'll keep him.
That'll be fine. Fine! Thanks!
-Hello, Margaret.
-Hello, Ted.
-lt's nice to see you again.
-Thanks.
By the way, l appreciate what you did about Seabiscuit.
-Well, that's all right.
-What are you doing here? lt's your day off. l'm driving you to the farm. l'm not going to the farm.
-Why not?
-l have work to do, studying and the like. l'll tell you a little secret. l don't believe you.
Well, please, Ted, l'm not going out.
All right. l'll drive you home or wherever you're going then.
Thanks, Ted. Goodbye.
Wait a minute, Margaret.
What's the matter? What have l done?
Last week l thought--
Last week l flirted with you a wee bit for Uncle Shawn.
He wanted to keep Seabiscuit where he could keep an eye on him.
Anyway, 'twas all for Uncle Shawn l did it.
No, Margaret, you're a bad liar.
Come on, give out.
All right, then. l'll give out. l should've told you before...
...but you happened along so sudden-like l didn't have the chance. l saw my own brother killed under a horse...
...and he was the best jockey of them all.
You poor kid. l could never stand to see you ride races day after day...
...or even to know you were riding them after we'd grown as close as--
As l know we would.
We'd say here your brother's number was up. lt could've happened in a car, in a plane...
...crossing the street, just as it did on the track.
But you can't let a thing like that come between us. l love you, Margaret.
Thanks, Ted.
'Tis a terrible cruel blow they're aiming at me...
...and l'm not going to take it. l'm a coward, Ted, and no girl for a man like you.
Now, sit still on the colts, boys.
Don't get them excited.
Take Seabiscuit in last, Ted.
-Well, it won't be long now, lrish.
-True. lt won't be long till what?
Boss, l don't think there's room for this guy and me on one breeding farm. lf l can't have the say as to what we keep...
...or what we let go, l want no part of it.
So we've made a deal.
Go on.
He finagled around until you held
Seabiscuit...
...over a full year against my advice.
Shawn's agreed if he's wrong...
-...he'll get out of my hair.
-How?
Beat it, go somewhere else. lf he's right, l'll be pulling out.
So there's the little runt up there with the other 2-year-olds...
...ready to lay it on the line.
And to show you l'm a fair guy, guess who's on him?
Ted Knowles.
Well, of all the childish, nonsensical--
Shawn, did you agree to this? l did, sir, for two reasons.
George has been unhappy about my interfering ways. l'd feel the same if a stranger moved in on my domain.
That's one. The other is this: lf l'm wrong about that colt...
...l shouldn't be here. l should be in a home for the demented.
You two, without consulting me, decided to go--?
They're running.
Come on! Come on, boy! Come on!
Well, he broke in front, stopped to a walk, and ran last with Knowles up.
He ate a lot of grain and hay in a year, lrish.
Most of it went to his knees from the looks of him. l've got to think this out.
-Have you thought about where you'll go?
-Shut up, George! l've got to think this out.
Now, listen, George, l've had enough of this.
You proved your point. Drop it right here.
Okay. lf you say so, boss.
Have him admit l'm right, and l'll forget it.
Shawn!
Glory be, that's it.
Listen, Shawn...
...George is willing to call off your deal.
Admit he's right and shake hands.
Right it is. He's as wrong as a man can be.
Boss, he'd drive anybody nuts.
Surely, you can't say that after what we've just seen.
Yes, l can. You see, he's a sociable little fellow.
He was out for a nice gallop with his pals that he's been in pasture with for a year.
Why should he run away from them with no carrot at the end?
Carrot? What are you talking about?
Never mind, never mind.
At the races now, with strangers in it, he'll be leaving them behind easy enough.
So now he's to go to the races.
Bless your heart and soul, yes, as quick as we can get him there.
Well, tie that! Stick, lrish.
You'll give me a laugh every day. l'll stay, and gladly, on one condition.
The little fellow goes away with the string to run the carousel.
Such faith as that should be rewarded, George.
-l agree.
-Thank you, sir.
The horses are approaching the starting gate. l'd have had you closer to the finish line, but l thought it better to hide out.
You see, l'm supposed to be on the farm.
Why, Uncle Shawn. lt's Seabiscuit l'm spying on.
So far that little colt has started
1 1 times and never won once.
-What's the matter with him?
-lt's a mystery.
Carson should've found out before this.
Now l'm going to find out.
He's in this race, far out.
All right, boys, get ahold of your horses and keep them moving.
That friend of yours is on the Biscuit. Ted Knowles.
Turn that three horse around, Jack, and take him in easy.
He's in number three, a nice spot.
They'll not cut him off.
Ted'll see to that.
He's a great lad to get a horse away.
Get ahold of that seven horse.
Turn his head around.
And they're off and running.
At the start it's Seabiscuit breaking on top.
Microbe is second. Green Mist is third.
Trance of Lady is fourth.
-He's in the lead.
-Up to now.
Passing the half-mile post, it's Seabiscuit in front by two lengths.
Green Mist is second by a head.
Microbe is third.
He's in front, running easy.
Too easy, l'd say.
Both ears forward. l don't like that.
Microbe is third. And Knowing is making a bid on the outside.
Put your ears back and listen for them.
They're not your friends.
They'll do you no good.
Knowing racing wide on the outside is second.
Here comes Pullman closing ground between horses.
-Come on, come on!
-Come on!
They're catching him.
They're catching him!
They passed him.
In a driving finish, it's Pullman in command.
Maggie, he's beat.
It's Pullman winning it by a half a length.
Knowing is second by a neck, and Royal Fox is third.
Out of the money again, a wicked shame.
Come on, Maggie, l want a word with the boss...
...even if it means me job.
Stopped to a walk. Always does.
He didn't finish like a tired colt.
He just didn't seem to be trying.
Hello, Mr. Millford.
Hello, Shawn and Margaret.
-How do you do, Mr. Millford.
-Well, my dear...
...l just saw a colt beaten that you selected.
That was only today. He'll do better. lt runs in the family. l'll wait for you, Uncle Shawn.
Sit down, Shawn.
-What are you doing here?
-l get it.
Came to watch his handpicked horse.
Two years old, and he's tired already.
Now, listen, both of you.
You just saw a colt beaten that should've won going away.
Great balls of fire, here we go again. l'm asking a favor, sir. l'd like to go the stables and make a little change in the Biscuit's blinkers.
While you're at it, you might trim his mane. lt may be throwing him off balance.
Well, how about it, sir? lrish, you give me more laughs than the funny papers.
Well, sir?
-George is training him.
-What about it, George?
Save yourself the trouble, lrish.
We're not taking the Biscuit on from here.
He's going to the farm for the winter.
George is the boss.
That cough of yours stays with you like poor relations.
-What is that you've got there?
-Your sassafras tea.
-That vile concoction.
-Now, you drink it down! l'm not touching it. Take it away.
Take it out of me sight!
-Here now, what's all the rumpus?
-He won't drink his sassafras tea.
Why, Uncle Shawn, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.
That poison is worse than me cough. lt's nothing of the kind.
We're only trying to help you.
You're not helping me.
You're killing me.
Get me a glass of water.
-You hear me?
-Just a minute, Uncle Shawn.
He's getting awful fussy here of late.
-Awful fussy, Miss Margaret.
-What's in this?
Just sassafras and lndian herbs. lt's to soothe his bronchial tubes.
Here, take this.
And get out of here before l blow a germ on you.
Now, no more shenanigans, Uncle Shawn.
You drink this.
Taste it for me, please.
That's all that l'll do, just taste it.
And to think l've been throwing this nectar into the fire. l feel better already. l agree with you, Margaret.
He should get to a warmer climate.
Where should l take him for a warmer climate?
You'll go with him? lndeed, and l will, sir.
What about your nursing? l'll be nurse to him and him alone until he's well.
Well, then l think we'd better make it California.
Charlie Howard bought a stock farm out there. He could use Shawn.
Oh, yes. l'll write to him.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Millford.
Hello, honey. l'm glad you didn't go to town. l want you to meet our new trainer.
This is Mrs. Howard.
Mr. O'Hara, how do you do?
The Mr. O'Hara bothers me, sir.
Shawn is what l answer to best.
Well, l've heard so much about you from Lady Maitland in London...
...l feel l really know you. l trained for Lord Maitland for 20 years.
She raves about you.
Says you're a wizard with horses, the greatest trainer in the world.
Well, Lady Maitland is extremely emotional.
We'll do all right with him training for us.
How about it, Shawn? lf you called me Mr. O'Hara, l'd have quit before l started.
Well, Shawn, you've seen it all now.
What do you think of our farm?
-How many acres have you now?
-Six thousand.
Did you ever see an acre win a race?
As bad as that?
We got to go east and do some buying. l've got my eye on one or two we can get.
We'd better start right away.
Wait, l don't know if l trust you two to go shopping.
Shawn will see that no one puts anything over on me.
Have you any particular favorites?
No, not offhand.
Yes, come to think of it now, l do know of one.
And he shouldn't cost you too much, either.
Sir, it'll be a pleasure to go east to the sales with you.
-lndeed it will, sir.
-Now we're gonna get someplace.
Gentlemen, this is the last consignment of the evening and a good one.
Tip number 47, a brown filly, trained as you'll need...
...by Gallant Fox out of Mistletoe.
She'd by Sunbolt. There she is.
What do you give for starters?
Let's have a bid.
-l'll give 8000.
-Eight thousand? This is Saratoga, Gus.
Did they clean you at the track this afternoon? l've got $8000. l'll stand on that.
Who'll make it 1 0?
-Ten thousand.
-Ten thousand l've got, $ 1 0,000.
Let's stop fooling around. l've got 1 0. Who'll make it 1 5?
-Fifteen thousand.
-Fifteen thousand it is.
Look how she's bred. l've got 1 5,000 now.
Whisper 20,000, somebody, and l'll get you.
-Twenty-five thousand.
-Twenty-five thousand!
Twenty-five thousand l've got.
Who'll say 30? l've got 25,000 once, 25,000 twice.
Any more?
And sold over there for $25,000 to Samuel D. Riddle. l'll bet you when that filly goes to breeding paddocks...
...the sire of her first foal will be none other than-- Remove your hats.
None other than Man o' War.
That's all for tonight.
Thank you very much.
Now is a good time.
Speak to him before he gets outside.
-l thought we came east to get the best.
-We did.
-You want me to buy a selling plater.
-l do. lf you get him and anything goes wrong, l'll work for you for 1 0 years as a stable boy.
-All right. Come along.
-No, leave me out of it. l'll see you later.
And the Knowles contract.
Get that if you can too.
Hello, Tom.
Hi, Charlie. l saw you across the sales ring.
-This is my trainer, George Carson.
-Hi.
-Did you buy anything?
-No, but l'll buy one now if you'll sell. l saw a 3-year-old of yours in a selling race...
...smallish sort of colt with big knees,
Seabiscuit.
Seabiscuit? Why do you want him?
You can't always shoot for the stakes. l gotta have some for cheap races.
He was entered for 6000.
Will you take 8000? l think so. How about it, George?
The string's pretty large, boss.
We got a lot like him.
-lt's a deal.
-Good. We'll get him tomorrow.
By the way, Tom, l hired Shawn
O'Hara on the strength of your letter.
What's the joke?
Nothing. Only George and l know now why you want the Biscuit.
When you get him back to California...
...don't let Shawn stable him in the living room.
-He ran pretty good today, Shawn.
-Yes, as far as he went.
Ted, you're riding for a grand man. l persuaded him to buy your contract. l didn't need much persuading.
This puts me nearer to the O'Haras.
Friday the 1 3th didn't bother the biscuit.
He ran third. That's better, anyway. lt's a great deal better, Mrs. Howard.
He knew to cock an ear at the last 1 6th.
Mr. Howard, l think he knows now.
Today did it.
Let's enter him in the Governor's Handicap in a week.
The Governor's Handicap? Him in a stake?
-Yes.
-l think l hired a completely mad lrishman.
Well, l don't. Go on, enter him, Shawn.
-Thank you.
-l'll see you later, Mrs. Howard.
People will laugh at us. The best horses are entered in that stake:
Azure Car, Biography, horses like that. l know, but remember what Lady Maitland said. Shawn was never wrong once.
Your Lady Maitland's making a fool out of me.
No, not a chance.
What are you doing, Shawn?
Listen, Ted, you just finished third on a colt that could've won. ls that so?
The bad ride beat him, huh?
No, his disposition beat him.
He's too friendly, too sociable for his own good.
Now, l've been working on an idea. l cut two holes in his blinkers, and here's what you've got to do.
The next time you start with him, take him to the front if you can.
When you see the head of a horse closing in on you out of the corner of your eye...
...hit the Biscuit with all the power that's in you, three times, no more.
After that, hand-ride him to the wire. ls that clear now?
Sure, that's easy.
And get this, do it every time you start, three terrible, hard cuts.
Okay, then what?
He'll soon learn it's not play, and it won't be long till you notice him...
...cocking an ear back to hear what's coming up behind.
After that, you won't need a whip.
He'll go to get away from it...
...when he gets a peek at the closing horse through the holes in his blinkers.
Well, it won't hurt to try. l'll ride him just that way. l think it'll work.
Turning into the stretch, it's Seabiscuit by two lengths.
Ned Gray is second by two,
Challopan is third.
He's still out in front.
Come on, little Biscuit!
He's got an ear back.
He's listening for them.
They're coming down to the wire.
It's Seabiscuit in front.
And it is Seabiscuit, the winner by a length.
Yeah! He won!
Now, what do you think?
Lady Maitland was right about Shawn.
She certainly was.
He's a wonderful man.
Well, me lad, it won't be long now.
Los Angeles in two hours.
-What do l ride first?
-Fair Knightess in the San Carlos Handicap.
-What's in it besides her?
-Not so much. She should win.
-Margaret's in Los Angeles, isn't she?
-Yes, she's a fully fledged nurse now.
You know, l can't get her out of my mind.
Maybe you don't want to.
-Are you in love with her, Ted?
-You're darn tooting. l'm tooting she's in love with you too.
So that ought to make it a sure thing, but it doesn't.
You'll have to bear with her.
She's running away from Danny's memory.
But she's not running away from it, Shawn. lt's right with her all the time. l wonder if she saw me ride a winner...
...if maybe that would fix things.
-What do you think?
-That's an idea.
-l'll have her at the San Carlos.
-That'll be great.
Hello, darling.
-Girl of me heart.
-You look fit as a fiddle.
And Seabiscuit, l wonder what Mr. Millford and Carson think of him now.
Well, to make the understatement of the year, Maggie, they're not happy. l'll tell you later.
Get in some clothes.
-You're going to Santa Anita with me.
-Seabiscuit isn't running today.
No, but you'll see something with two legs...
...who's in a fair way to become a champion himself.
-Need l tell you his name?
-No, you needn't. l can't go. l'm on duty.
You love Ted, don't you?
Please, Uncle Shawn, this isn't the time or the place.
-l told you, l'm on duty.
-l'm thinking of your duty to yourself.
You're neglecting it shamefully.
You'll never be happy sticking your head out of sight like an ostrich.
Hold it up proud, me girl, and face the truth.
Now, hurry, you're free for the afternoon.
-Who said?
-The superintendent.
-l just talked to her.
-You didn't say we were going to the races. l told her you were my niece, l was from lreland...
...and that l'd be in Los Angeles for just this afternoon.
-Well, you lying old devil.
-You do me a great wrong, Maggie.
There's not a word of a lie in it.
You're me niece, right enough, and surely l'm from lreland.
And l'm driving back to the ranch this very night.
Are you sure it was the superintendent,
Ms. Newsome, you saw? l doubt her letting anyone off.
That's it. Newsome. A sour, old witch with a voice like a foghorn...
...and a eye like a tomcat.
Did l hear my name?
Me dear lady, you did, indeed. l was just talking about a Ms. Newsome of County Kerry. l was thinking how strange it was that you, so kind, so generous, so understanding...
...should have the same name as that old harridan.
Get into your street clothes quickly, child.
There's a service at All Saints at 2:00.
Yes.
The horses are approaching the starting gate.
-Sit here in front, Margaret.
-No, Mrs. Howard. l'm fine here.
All right. Let's go.
Pull that number 3 horse a little slow, Ed.
He's a bad actor. Stay with him.
-Fair Knightess will be all right.
-l'll say this, Mr. Howard...
...the jockey doesn't live that can get a horse away better than Ted.
That's fine, boys.
Now take that 6 horse in.
-You never saw him win one, did you?
-No. No, l didn't.
Well, l think you're going to see it now.
Watch him, he's on Fair Knightess.
Get up with that number one horse, Jack.
There they go.
It's Legal Light going to the front,
Indian Broom is second, Pompoon is third...
...He Did is fourth, Time Supply is fifth....
-He got off all right, Shawn.
-Yes, he's fine now.
Star Shadow in front by a length and one half.
Pompoon on the inside is second by a half-length.
He Did is third....
-He's right up with the leaders.
-Yes, ma'am. This is where she does her run.
There goes Fair Knightess on the inside, turning for home.
He Did in front by two lengths.
Pompoon is second by a half-length.
Fair Knightess, moving between horses, is third, by a half-length.
Star Shadow on the outside.
Turning on the stretch, it's Pompoon in front by three lengths.
He Did is second, a half-length.
Star Shadow is third.
It's Pompoon in front by three lengths.
Star Shadow is second by a half-length.
Time Supply--
And Fair Knightess fell.
It's Pompoon in front by one length. Star Shadow--
Oh, Charles.
He Did is third.
They're coming to the run...
...with Pompoon winning it by one length.
Star Shadow is second...
...and He Did was third by three lengths.
Knowles is hurt. He hasn't moved.
-Let me go, Uncle Shawn. Let me go.
-Now, Maggie--
Let me go!
Yes, yes. You're such an understanding soul, Ms. Newsome. l'm sure you'll agree we can't run away from things.
The sooner we face them, the better. l quite agree, Mr. O'Hara. l'll put her on the case.
Yes, thank you, ma'am. Yes.
-Reporting, Ms. Finch.
-Oh, yes, Margaret.
Private room 1 7, contusions and fractures.
-Talbot is on duty now. Relieve her.
-Yes, ma'am.
There's no special orders.
Just keep him quiet.
-Alice?
-Yes, what is it?
Stay five minutes longer, please. l want to see Ms. Newsome.
Ms. Newsome, l've been assigned to the case in room 1 7, night duty.
Please, take me off.
Give it to someone else.
-Why?
-Well, l know the patient. lt's a personal matter.
Personal matters and feelings must not enter into the profession of nursing.
-You will remain on the case.
-But....
Hello, Margaret.
This is the best break l've had today.
You must be quiet.
Come over here with that pencil.
-l want you to write your name on my cast.
-That's silly. lf you say so, l won't let anybody else sign it. l'll give you exclusive rights.
What do you say?
There you are, now. Dr. Fowler will be here any minute to give you a final.
-Then you can go.
-That'll suit you fine l'll bet.
A nurse is always glad at seeing a patient well enough to leave.
Yeah, especially when he's been a pain in the neck to her.
No, Ted. Don't say that.
Why not? You showed it plain enough.
To you l was just another patient.
-l've tried to fill your every need.
-You missed the big one.
-What was that?
-This.
Take care. Your arm. l wish l could use it.
Kiss me, Margaret.
Stop this now. lt's unseemly.
You're my patient.
Always the nurse.
Can't you be a girl for one little minute? l can try.
-Now, that's more like it. Try again.
-No.
No more, ever.
Are you crazy?
Yes, crazy like a loon, or l wouldn't say what l'm going to say now.
Would you...?
Would you really want me for always?
That's what the man said back in Kentucky. lt's the same in California, anywhere.
-l'd give up nursing.
-You bet your sweet life. l'd give up anything. Would you?
-Honey, l think l would.
-Wait, you only think. You must be sure.
All right. l'm sure.
Well, then, here comes the craziest part.
Could you...?
Would you give up riding?
Give up riding? l couldn't bear it. lt would tear the heart out of me.
-Why don't you ask me to give up breathing?
-l know. l know.
Look, Margaret, it's my life.
All those people, my friends, l'd be letting them down. Don't you see?
Yes, l see, Ted. lt was wicked of me to ask it.
You'll be all right till the doctor comes and lets you go.
Goodbye and good luck.
Well, here we are right atop the grandstand at Santa Anita Park.
Just one of 70,000 excited folks who've come...
...to witness the fabulous
$ 1 00,000 Santa Anita Handicap.
Among the starters will be the greatest horse running, the one and only Seabiscuit.
He lost this race to Rosemont last year.
The horses are in the saddling ring. lt won't be long before they're on the track and away.
Don't worry. Woolf's good.
He'll give him a heady ride.
He isn't called ''lceman'' for nothing.
George is okay, but Mr. Howard, l wish l was gonna ride him.
-Plenty of speed here.
-We'll take care of that.
-Hi, George.
-Hello, kid.
-How's the lceman?
-l'm glad you're able to be here.
The main thing is how are you? l'm good. l've got a few bones left to break.
-So you're gonna ride the Biscuit?
-Yeah, and listen...
...l'm gonna split my fee with you too, fellow.
Go to your horses.
Riders up.
-You've one horse to beat. Stagehand.
-l know.
Watch him.
-Shawn, do you think he'll win it?
-lf he does, it'll be a miracle. l don't believe the horse lives that can give that Stagehand...
...30 pounds and a beating at the distance.
The horses are at the starting gate.
There they go.
Primulus is going to the front.
Aneroid is second.
-The Biscuit got in trouble at the start.
-They crowded him.
Woodbury is fifth. Sceneshifter is sixth.
Time Supply and Top Row.
Passing the grandstand the first time is
Whichcee in front on the inside by a head.
Primulus, between horses, is second by a head.
Aneroid, on the outside, is third, a length and one-half.
Top Row, on the rail, is fourth by one length.
Pompoon is fifth.
And the Seabiscuit is far back.
Around the clubhouse turn is Whichcee in front on the inside by a head.
He's so far back.
He's so far back!
Aneroid, on the outside, is third by a length and one-half. And Woodbury.
Turning into the backstretch is Whichcee in front on the inside by a half-length.
Aneroid is second by 3 1 /2 lengths.
Count Atlas is third by a head.
Primulus is fourth by a head.
Top Row is fifth.
And Seabiscuit on the outside.
Passing the half-mile post, it's Aneroid in front by one length.
Woodbury is second, a head.
Whichcee is third by a half-length.
Pompoon is fourth by a head.
And there goes Seabiscuit on the outside.
Seabiscuit is fifth.
Seabiscuit is fourth, moving very fast.
Seabiscuit is third.
It's Seabiscuit, now second on the outside.
And Seabiscuit is taking the lead.
It's Seabiscuit in front.
Turning for home, Seabiscuit in front by a length and one-half.
Aneroid is second by a head.
Pompoon is third by a head.
And here they come....
-He ran that half in 45 and 4/5ths.
-lmpossible. No horse ever ran that fast.
There it is, way below the world record.
He'll have nothing left for the finish.
Stagehand on the outside.
Here comes Stagehand.
It's Seabiscuit in front on the inside by a half-length.
Biscuit! Come on, Biscuit.
And Pompoon in the middle of the track.
It's Seabiscuit and Stagehand.
Seabiscuit on the inside, Stagehand on the outside, head and head.
It's Stagehand and Seabiscuit.
They're driving hard.
It's Stagehand and Seabiscuit, and it's very close.
-Did he win it?
-l don't know.
A dead heat, after all the trouble he was in.
-What a horse!
-Yeah.
Please hold all tickets. It's a photo finish.
-l say Stagehand.
-No, Seabiscuit by a nod.
-Stagehand.
-Seabiscuit.
-Well, who won it, Oscar?
-Seabiscuit. No, no, Stagehand.
-Or was it Seabiscuit?
-You're such a help.
The winner is Stagehand.
The result of the race has been declared official.
Poor baby.
Mr. Howard, l'll win this race with him next year. l promise you that.
-The horse has been doing very well.
-Very well indeed.
What about a match race between
Seabiscuit and War Admiral, Mr. Howard?
-They're the two top horses.
-l'm agreeable with conditions fair to both.
-And a proper purse.
-You favor any particular track?
No, just one that'll accommodate as many people as possible.
-There any calls, Phil?
-Mr. O'Hara is waiting to see you.
-Hello, George.
-Hello, Mr. O'Hara. l just read the big news.
-What are you doing here?
-l dropped in for a word with you.
-All right. Let's go over there and sit down.
-Well, what l have to say won't take long.
Now, here's the idea.
Be at the track ready to ride at 4:00 tomorrow morning.
At 4:00 in the morning? For what? l want to school a horse.
School a horse at 4:00 in the morning?
-Look, l'm no exercise boy.
-True, you're a jockey.
You're the jockey who'll ride
Seabiscuit against War Admiral.
-Would you like to win?
-Would l.
Listen then. ln this race we're using the walk-up start. lt's their idea because War Admiral is the fastest-breaking horse in the world.
He's used to being three jumps ahead before the starting bell stops ringing.
Now, l've got a notion that if a horse...
...got away stride for stride with him or better, it might bother him...
...hurt his pride.
He mightn't run his race.
You see how the walk-up could be worked to our advantage?
Yeah, yeah. lt sure could.
Very well then.
We get into Biscuit's mind...
...that the start is no frolic. lt's strictly business.
But how?
Be at the track at 4:00 and you'll find out.
Okay, l'll be there.
Listen, Goldy, when you hear the bell, hit him a crack.
What bell?
-This one on the alarm clock.
-Okay.
Walk him up slowly, George.
Give him his head when you hear the bell.
-All ready, Goldy?
-All ready.
Come on with him, George.
Come on back with him, George.
Go get him, Goldy.
Once more, George. We'll try it again.
-How often we gonna do this?
-Once more.
We keep it up until he understands what he's got to do at Pimlico.
Okay by me, if you say so.
And now friends, here's that well-known sports commentator, Fred Baker...
...whose subject this afternoon is the race of the century.
Hello, everybody. lt won't be long...
...until we know which is the champion of champions, War Admiral or Seabiscuit.
Easterners are prepared to bet
Wall Street holdings...
...on the great 3-year-old.
Westerners declare that the gold in them there hills is called Seabiscuit.
I've studied the record of both horses very carefully.
Here's my advice: If you want the winner, bet on both of them.
One thing is certain at any rate: It'll be settled this afternoon down in Maryland.
Each horse carries 1 20 pounds.
He'll race for $ 1 5,000...
...winner take all, after a walk-up start.
That's why all roads today lead to Pimlico.
At Baltimore's Pimlico track, the program tells the story.
Seabiscuit versus War Admiral, in what is destined to become...
...one of the outstanding horse races of all time.
Betting is heavy on the first match race in almost a century...
...between horses of the same blood.
It's about time.
The great crowd waits anxiously.
It's to be a walk-up start. No gate.
War Admiral breaks first, but no-go.
False start.
Easy boy, steady now.
They're together, and they're off!
And War Admiral, on the inside, breaks to his usual fast start.
Woolf goes to his whip on Seabiscuit.
He's out to beat the Admiral at his own game.
Driving to the front, he takes the lead over War Admiral as they go into the turn.
Racing fans are stunned.
None believed that Seabiscuit has just the speed to outrun...
...so fast a horse as War Admiral, but he's doing it.
War Admiral accepts the challenge.
They glide down the stretch with ground-eating strides.
Jockey Kurtsinger calls on the Admiral for more speed.
There he goes. He's catching the Biscuit. He's got him.
The battle is on.
They run neck and neck like a team harness.
This is one of the fastest stages.
The crowd roars as Jockey Woolf relentlessly urges Seabiscuit to the limit.
None, but a wonderfully game thoroughbred can stand a drive like this.
Fans know that one or the other of these magnificent thoroughbreds must crack.
They watch breathlessly, wondering which it'll be.
Will it be War Admiral or the Biscuit?
Whichever, the crowd is seeing...
...one of the greatest races of all time anywhere in the world.
Only 400 yards to come as they head toward the homestretch.
Kurtsinger goes to the whip on War Admiral on the outside.
Now, it's do or die, jockey against jockey...
...true thoroughbred against true thoroughbred.
It's the blood of Man o' War, his grandson next to the rail, his son on the outside.
No more is it speed.
Now it's heart and stamina.
And Seabiscuit pulls away with powerful strides.
As the big California 5-year-old, veteran of 83 hard-fought races says:
''Catch me if you can!''
It's Seabiscuit under the wire
4 lengths ahead to prove himself...
...America's undisputed thoroughbred champion.
We won. We won.
And now, my dear, may l escort you to the winner's circle?
Let's go.
Well, what do you think of early rising now, George? l'll meet you at 4:00 in the morning anytime you say.
-How fast did he go?
-Now, that's a remarkable 3/4 of a mile...
...1 1 2 and 1 /5th with
1 30 pounds on his back. l've got a hunch this is Seabiscuit's year.
By a strange coincidence, l've got the same hunch. lt's the Biscuit's year, all right.
His year to win the Santa Anita.
-Wouldn't that be wonderful?
-lndeed...
...and by even stranger coincidence, l've got the same hunch.
-Of course, we're all somewhat prejudiced.
-Yeah.
Well, a hunch is a hunch, Mr. Howard.
Don't let anyone tilt you off it.
Don't worry, l won't.
-That's encouraging.
-Yes.
-lsn't he beautiful?
-He certainly is.
-Feeling good, hey, Tom?
-Yes, sir.
-Good boy. Good old Biscuit.
-Get down, Tom. Lead him around once.
-That's bad.
-What's the matter?
-What is it?
-The way he was using his right foreleg.
-His leg? l didn't notice it.
-l hope it's not what l'm thinking it is.
What is it, Shawn?
-Tom, get the bed.
-Yes, sir. l can't rightly tell, but l don't like the feel of the leg at all.
-But, Shawn, he wasn't limping badly.
-He was trying not to, bless his heart...
...but l doubt if he'll be able to run in the Santa Anita.
-Oh, no.
-That's terrible news.
-A good soldier home from the wars.
-So many, many battles, poor darling.
-No Santa Anita for us, fellow.
-Don't say that yet, Ted.
-What else would l say?
-l don't know. What about it?
The stud is the place for him.
-He can't be brought back?
-l don't think so.
-Charlie, he's earned a rest.
-You brought back Golden Girl, remember?
A young thing that ran half a dozen races with a feather on her back.
He's run near 1 00, 30 of them in record time with high weight on him.
Then there's no chance?
-A faint one, if any.
-Faint or not, we'll take it.
Not even you can talk me off the Biscuit.
-As you say, sir.
-What's the program?
Give up everything and devote ourselves to nursing him.
-All right, that's it.
-Ted, you stay and help us.
-We'll bring you back too.
-Thank you, sir. l'll stay.
Put him in a stall.
And so we started on the long, tedious road...
...to bring the Biscuit back.
The first step was to cool his leg off.
So Shawn would sponge his leg daily.
It was a labor of love, and no one loved a horse more than Shawn did this one.
Then he was turned out to crop grass.
He looked at peace there, limping around...
...far away from the races and the excitement of the crowds.
I put in my two bits worth, and used to walk him...
...around the ring for the limbering up process...
...under the watchful eye of Mrs. Howard, who never once lost faith.
Next, we ponied him...
...and I used to get up early and pony him around our little track.
Not too far at first, and just slowly.
As you know, from the time he was a baby, he always liked carrots.
And Shawn used to reward him after a day's work.
They seemed to have a lot of fun together.
At last, on to the training track for a slow breeze.
Just easy at first, but the Biscuit knew how to handle himself...
...and went just the pace we wanted him to.
They say a champion never comes back, but he was the exception.
He really was feeling his oats and raring to go.
Shawn and he were happy over the whole thing...
...for the people's choice, as the public called him...
...was ready for his first stiff work and the Santa Anita Handicap.
Uncle Shawn, it's been ages since l saw you.
Well, l have you for two whole weeks now.
My vacation has shrunk to two days.
Ms. Newsome reminded me that nurses are too scarce and cases too plentiful.
Bother Ms. Newsome, that old harridan.
She only let me go at all because she remembers you, sentimentally.
She asks after you.
You better watch out, Uncle Shawn.
She asks after me?
Never fear. l've been watching out a long time now.
So has Ms. Newsome.
Gruesome Newsome, blast her. ln there with you.
You'll be right in your element here, Maggie.
We're all nurses now.
-Nurses?
-The patient is one little horse. Seabiscuit.
We're getting ready to try for the Santa Anita again.
-But the paper said he was finished.
-Yes, and l'd have sworn it too...
...but now l know that so long as he can draw breath, you can't finish him.
Tomorrow, Ted is working him against the best horses in the ranch.
-Ted? ls he here?
-As if you didn't know. l've forgotten all about him.
-How is he?
-Coming along as fine as Seabiscuit. ln the Santa Anita, you'll see Ted up on him. l won't see him.
You still love the lad, Margaret.
-l tell you, he's out of my mind completely.
-But not out of your heart.
Sure and l can't help myself.
The devil take Ted Knowles.
Margaret, your happiness is more important than the big race.
Would it lift the cloud off your eyes if l tried to talk Ted out of riding? l'd be the happiest girl in the world.
Uncle Shawn, you're a darling.
Hold on now. lt's not an accomplishment as yet.
You won't have any trouble getting someone as good as Ted to ride. l've asked George Woolf to stand by in case Ted doesn't come around.
Jockey for jockey, there's little to choose between them.
Well then, things are going to work out right for everyone, aren't they?
'Tis to be hoped for, Maggie darling.
-Where's Ted Knowles, Goldy?
-He's getting a rubdown too, Mr. O'Hara.
Okay, Ted. Turn over.
-How's it going, Ted?
-Man, did the Biscuit want to run today.
-Santa Anita, here we come.
-You're looking as good as new yourself.
Except for the inner tube around his waist.
He's gotta lose 9 pounds. Okay, Ted.
-How long do l have to stay in this thing?
-About half an hour.
You asked for it.
Brother, l got it.
You're going to feel like a million dollars, though.
So it's back to pounding and sweating it off and dieting for you, hey, lad? l'll say. l haven't had a good feed for two weeks.
Salads and toast. Oh, brother.
You seem like a smart lad.
-What made you want to become a jockey?
-Are you kidding?
You got to be smart to bring home as many winners as l have.
Peanut?
Excuse me, my mistake.
No, the smart ones in this game are the trainers.
How do you figure?
We make the important money.
And what good is money to a man when he can't satisfy his stomach?
-Here's your eats, Shawn.
-Thank you, me lad.
You don't have to eat all the time, do you?
Well, excuse me, l'm taking me lunch on the fly today.
Hamburgers, one of America's great institutions.
To think they were here all the time l was spending...
...the best years of me life in lreland.
There's lots of good food in the world.
Steak and kidney pie with nice dainty dumplings well worked in.
A tender roast of pork with applesauce.
How was the Biscuit?
Did he eat his breakfast this morning?
He ate more than l did. l'd like to steal some of that.
Well, that's the way it is with jockeys.
You starve when you're out of work, you get yourself a job, you starve some more.
A sad state of affairs.
Talk all you want, there's nothing to beat the thrill of a race.
-Where's your trainer then?
-l was coming to that.
The trainer sits on the grandstand nice and easy...
...with his girl beside him. lf he has one.
He listens to the band.
He sits there all comfortable, holding his girl's hand. lf he has one.
-You talk too much.
-One word more.
Come over to my place for dinner.
Dinner? You think l'm crazy?
What's got into you anyway?
Wait, now. lf you do well up there, the one thing in the whole world...
...a lad of your age thinks more of than a good meal. l'll be there.
Me appetite isn't what it used to be.
What have you got there, Ted?
Carrots, huh?
That's Seabiscuit's favorite dish.
You ate better when you were in the hospital.
Very funny. Very funny.
Children, l made a strange discovery this morning. lt was while l was shaving.
Strange indeed and tragic.
Oh, Uncle Shawn. lt came on me all of the sudden without any warning. Startled me into speech.
''O'Hara,'' says l,
''you're not getting any younger.''
Oh, the shock of it. l was in a panic all day thinking and thinking about it.
Well, here's the conclusion l've come to. l've got to look for a young lad, a lad who knows horses...
...who gives his heart to them. l'd put him on as assistant trainer...
...and he'd soon learn enough to take over...
...when l move into slippers and a chair by the fire.
Well, l've got to go and have a look at a colt that has a touch of colic. l'll take me cake along with me.
Me poor back.
There's little left of me.
Aren't you going to have some chocolate cake? Wong makes it grand.
No, l can't touch it.
But l could have some if....
Margaret, listen to me.
You wouldn't marry
Ted Knowles the jockey.
Would you marry Ted Knowles, your Uncle Shawn's assistant?
Ted, do you really think he meant you?
Yes, that scheming, conniving old faker.
He's as sound as he ever was.
You know what l think?
You put him up to it.
No, Ted. lt was his idea entirely.
You O'Haras. l think maybe l'm marrying a--
An O'Hara will do anything to get what he wants.
At least, that's the way it is with this O'Hara.
Here. Try this on.
Oh, Ted, darling. lt's sparkling like my heart.
And how did you happen to bring it along tonight?
Could it be you planned the whole thing with Shawn?
No, l bought it the day before l went to the hospital. l've been carrying it around just in case.
O'Haras have nothing on the Knowles when it comes to getting what they want.
Ted, darling, you're a wonderful boy to give up what you love best for me.
What l used to love best doesn't count anymore.
You're my favorite across the board.
Me take dishes now?
Dishes wait.
Romance.
-Hello, this is George Woolf.
-This is Shawn O'Hara.
Hello, Mr. O'Hara.
Say, how would you like to ride Seabiscuit?
You bet l would, but you're too late.
Hey, you can't say that, George.
You can't let me down. l'm not letting you down. Ted Knowles told me he was gonna ride him.
With Ted on Biscuit and Hoss on Kayak, what more do you want?
Kayak? There's only one horse in the race, George, and that's Seabiscuit.
-He's all yours.
-I'm sorry, Shawn, it's impossible.
What's that you say?
Me ears must be playing tricks.
You heard right, but l couldn't stall any longer.
Yeah, but listen, listen,
George. George. l'm sorry. For my money, the Biscuit's the greatest horse in the world.
But look out for Heel Fly in a cap, you guys. That's my mount.
Cute little fellow, isn't he?
Ted, l've just had news of a startling nature.
George Woolf has signed to ride Heel Fly for the Circle F.
No kidding.
We're in a pickle.
And there's only one way out.
That's a bad break.
No, sir. Nothing doing. l'm going to be sitting up in the grandstand with my best girl by my side.
Ted. Just a minute.
Now, see here, lad.
You brought this about.
You'd no right to tell George you were riding Biscuit.
-Now, wait a minute, that--
-Don't evade the situation. lt rests squarely on your strong, young shoulders.
Would you let Mr. Howard down?
And through Mr. Howard, me, your uncle-to-be?
And through me, Margaret, the girl you love.
Look who's talking.
Who got me to give up riding?
-Who talked about food until l was starving?
-Food is for pigs.
Who forced me to take the job of assistant trainer? lt was an old man talking to you, boy.
An old man with blood dried in his veins.
Never listen to such nonsense. l don't know. l like the idea of sitting in the grandstand.
The saints preserve us.
Did l ever think l'd see a young jock ready to swap a seat on a horse for the grandstand?
Talk all you want. lt won't do any good. l promised Margaret.
Yes, but was your heart in your promise?
Do you want some other jockey on the Biscuit in the handicap?
Are you the sort of boy that any old fool like meself...
...can talk out of the greatest thrill in the world, winning the Santa Anita?
What's grandstands compare to checking your horse at the starting gate?
And the gate sprung and you're off.
You feel Seabiscuit running swift and--
Cut it out. You know l'd give my eye to be there.
You shouldn't have interrupted. l had the race all but won for you.
But l won't be winning it.
When Margaret returns, she expects me to be a trainer. That's what l will be.
Ted, a word to the wise.
The O'Hara women are not inclined to favor men they can dominate. l recall sadly the case of me great Aunt Sheila, rest her soul.
A beauty if there ever was one, and every young man for miles around...
...showed he's willing to be a slave.
She went to the grave an old maid.
She didn't want slaves.
She wanted to be one.
Now, Margaret is much like Sheila.
-l'll write to Margaret, and if she says--
-No. Let me do the telling.
When she sees you again, she'll melt, loving you more...
...because you're a headstrong young bucko with a will of your own.
Let me do the telling.
She's an O'Hara and
O'Haras understand each other...
...and stick to each other through thick and thin.
Okay, Shawn. You've got yourself a boy.
Just square it with the future Mrs. Knowles.
Get in the hot box and sweat off that steak and chocolate cake.
Quickly now, or do l have to take the whip to you?
Ted, you and the Biscuit are like one.
'Tis the poetry of motion, indeed it is.
Wong!
Wong?
Yes, missy, please?
When did Ted start riding again?
Maybe one, two days after missy left last time.
He ride Biscuit in big race.
Wong has placed a bet. l see. Call a taxi for me right away, please.
But missy just arrive.
Call a taxi. And give this to Mr. Knowles when you see him.
Hello? Hello, taxi?
Come quick.
Howard ranch, O'Hara house.
Yes. No. Please.
Right on the dot.
Perfect, me boy. Everything perfect.
Excuse, please.
Missy O'Hara at home, but go quick, like flash.
-What?
-Make sense, man. Make sense.
Missy O'Hara find out you ride, ask Wong to carry bad tidings.
So you fixed it. ''She's an O'Hara and the O'Haras understand each other.''
-You wrote and explained everything.
-l must confess l didn't write the letter. lt seemed a matter to be talked out face to face after all.
-Oh, brother.
-Excuse, please.
-l should like to finish the race.
-You got us into this.
You talk it out with Margaret and talk fast. l'm thinking the duty should be yours, me lad.
Lovers have a way of solving these problems...
...that present difficulties to innocent bystanders.
Little problems. lnnocent bystander.
Why you old goat.
You talk it out with her or l'll break-- l'll break training right now.
Easy, me lad, easy.
Your word is my command.
Excuse, please.
Where is the taxi that was supposed to come here?
-Now, wait a minute, Maggie.
-Give me that phone.
-Hey? What goes there?
-Maggie, me darling--
-You miserable, deceitful man.
-Calm down, me girl. Calm down.
You never called a cab for me.
Excuse, please. Wong just recall, wash dishes.
-You men are all alike.
-Now, Maggie, hold your horses.
-Don't mention horses to me again.
-lf you only listen, l'll explain.
An emergency call.
Woolf signed with another stable.
Ted was obligated to save the situation.
Why Ted? There are jockeys to be had for the asking.
None of them know the Biscuit as well as Ted.
Maggie, darling, l had the devil's time convincing him. l persuaded him you'd see things in the proper light. l should never have trusted him alone with you. You're a deceitful old man.
And tell me this, Shawn O'Hara:
Why should l see it in what you're pleased to call ''the proper light''?
Because as promised, it would have led to the lad's ruination.
He was losing respect for himself.
And before long, he would have lost respect for you as well.
Go to him and tell him you're as happy as a lark he's riding the Biscuit. l can't do that. You ought to understand.
You know how l feel. l understand this, Margaret, that you're lacking in courage.
That's not fair.
You've been running and running away from your problem instead of facing it squarely.
Ted's going to ride in the big race.
And l want you to want him to ride. lt's the only thing that'll cure you.
Since when did your knowledge of horseflesh extend to women?
You--
You two-faced old meddler.
What Missy O'Hara say.
Me own flesh and blood.
Margaret.
Was ever a woman so humiliated to have her man stolen by a horse?
-You don't mean that it's over.
-'Tis not tricks that l'm up to, Ted. l came to say goodbye and to wish you and Seabiscuit the best of luck. l thought you'd forgive me when you saw how it was.
Forgive you for allowing
Uncle Shawn's tongue to sway you?
-l'm not hiding behind your uncle.
-The old conniver.
Aren't you now?
-l suppose he had nothing to do with it.
-l would have anyway.
Because l love you, l thought it was right for me to quit riding.
But it wasn't right because it made me quit a loser.
This much l do know about the O'Haras.
You wouldn't want a man that was a loser.
So l'll quit a winner or not at all.
-ls that all you have to say, Ted?
-That's all, Margaret.
Except, l love you.
This is one time l'm glad l'm a radio announcer...
...because l'm up here on the roof away from that mob of people.
Santa Anita's jammed again, and l really mean jammed, and the reason is simple.
The great Seabiscuit is making another bid for the $ 1 00,000 handicap.
Nine months ago, the wonder horse broke down, but he's here today for one last try.
What do l think of his chances? Well, l hate to say it, but champions don't come back.
And now the horses are on the track and parading to the post.
Number one looks good.
He won't be in the money.
Can't Seabiscuit win, Ed?
Broke down, 1 30 pounds on him.
Not a chance.
Knowles is on Seabiscuit.
Two cripples.
-Howard must be out of his mind.
-He's got Seabiscuit for sentiment...
...and Kayak to win.
Well, if it goes wrong, Shawn, l'm to blame.
Sure enough, sir. And if it goes right, you're the fellow who did it.
They'll be at the post soon.
You can't see from here. l don't want to.
Couldn't bear to watch. l see.
The horses are at the starting gate.
He's quiet as usual.
There they go!

Don't worry. He spoils you for riding any other horse.
And look, baby, l'm not a jockey anymore.

Good day. Lovely day, isn't it?
-Yes, Shawn.
-Yeah, charming, yes.

How do you do?
It's my very pleasant duty to welcome you here... on behalf of Walt Disney,
Leopold Stokowski... and all the other artists and musicians whose combined talents... went into the creation of this new form of entertainment, Fantasia.
What you're going to see... are the designs and pictures and stories... that music inspired in the minds and imaginations... of a group of artists.
In other words, these are not going to be... the interpretations of trained musicians.
Which I think is all to the good.
So now we present... the Tocatta and Fugue in D-Minor by Johann Sebastian Bach... interpreted in pictures by Walt Disney and his associates... and in music by the Philadelphia Orchestra... and its conductor,
Leopold Stokowski.
You know, it's funny how wrong an artist can be about his own work.
Now, the one composition of
Tchaikovsky's that he really detested... was his Nutcracker Suite... which is probably the most popular thing he ever wrote.
Incidentally, you won't see any nutcracker on the screen.
There's nothing left of him but the title.
And now we're going to hear a piece of music that tells a very definite story.
It's a very old story.
One that goes back almost 2,000 years.
A legend about a sorcerer who had an apprentice.
He was a bright young lad very anxious to learn the business.
As a matter of fact, he was a little bit too bright... uh, because he started practising some of the boss's best magic tricks... before learning how to control them.
Mr. Stokowski.
Mr. Stokowski.
My congratulations, sir.
Congratulations to you, Mickey.
Gee, thanks.
Well, so long.
I'll be seein' ya.
Bye.
When Igor Stravinsky wrote his ballet,
The Rite of Spring... his purpose was, in his own words, to ''express primitive life. ''
So Walt Disney and his fellow artists have taken him at his word.
Instead of presenting the ballet in its original form... as a simple series of tribal dances, they have visualized it as a pageant-- as the story of the growth of life on Earth.
It's a coldly accurate reproduction of what science thinks went on... during the first few billion years of this planet's existence.
So now imagine yourselves out in space... billions and billions of years ago... looking down on this lonely, tormented little planet... spinning through an empty sea of nothingness.
Uh, before we get into the second half of the programme...
I'd like to introduce somebody to you-- somebody who's very important to Fantasia.
He's very shy and very retiring.
I just happened to run across him one day at the Disney studios.
But when I did, I realized... that here was not only an indispensable member of the organization... but a screen personality.
And so I'm very happy to have this opportunity to introduce to you... the soundtrack.
Come on. Don't be timid.
That a soundtrack.
Now, watching him, I discovered that every beautiful sound... also creates an equally beautiful picture.
Now, look. Will the soundtrack kindly produce a sound?
Go on, don't be nervous.
Go ahead. Any sound.
Well, that isn't quite what I had in mind.
Uh, suppose we see and hear the harp.
Uh, now one of the strings-- say, the violin.
And now-- now one of the woodwinds-- a flute.
Very pretty.
Now let's have a brass instrument-- the trumpet.
Oh, all right. Now, uh, how about a low instrument-- the bassoon?
Go on. Go on.
Drop the other shoe, will you?
Well, now to finish, suppose we see some of the percussion instruments... beginning with the bass drum.
Thanks a lot, all of ya.
The symphony that Beethoven called the ''Pastoral''... his sixth, is one of the few pieces of music he ever wrote... that tells something like a definite story.
He was a great nature lover, and in this symphony... he paints a musical picture of a day in the country.
Now, of course, the country that Beethoven described... was the countryside with which he was familiar.
But his music covers a much wider field than that... and so Walt Disney has given the ''Pastoral''symphony... a mythological setting.
Now we're going to do one of the most famous and popular ballets... ever written--
''The Dance of the Hours''... from Ponchielli's opera
La Gioconda.
It's a pageant of the hours of the day.
All this takes place in the great hall... with its garden beyond... of the palace of Duke Alvise, a Venetian nobleman.
The last number in our Fantasia programme... is a combination of two pieces of music so utterly different... in construction and mood that they set each other off perfectly.
The first is
''A Night on Bald Mountain''... by one of Russia's greatest composers,
Modeste Mussorgsky.
The second is Franz Schubert's immortal ''Ave Maria. ''
Musically and dramatically, we have here... a picture of the struggle between the profane and the sacred.
