Here is the most unusual feature film
Walt Disney ever made.
A film intended not so much to entertain, but to send a message.
Walt, like many people, was impressed by the text of a book called
Victory Through Air Power, written by Major Alexander P. De Seversky.
In it, this Russian born naturalized American citizen, who became a key figure in the advancement of U.S. military aviation, called for an overhaul of our priorities.
He was convinced that the only way to win the war was to focus our energies on creating long-range bomber planes.
Remember that when this film was released in 1943, victory in Europe and the Pacific was far from certain.
...spearhead of short-range aviation, pushed step by step through the Balkans.
There was no end in sight and our losses were tremendous.
Walt believed in the principles of Seversky's book.
And felt it was his patriotic duty to spread the word.
By making a Technicolor feature film about the subject, with limited commercial potential, in the midst of many other wartime duties,
Walt quite simply put his money where his mouth was.
The message Seversky delivers, quite convincingly in this film, isn't about aggression or warmongering.
It's about winning a war against enemies who were bent on world domination.
A war America stayed out of, until we were attacked without provocation at Pearl Harbor.
That's the historical context that gives meaning to this film today.
For animation buffs, it's yet another example of how skillfully the Disney artists adapted their visual storytelling techniques to a deadly serious purpose.
And how successful they were.
In the introductory history of aviation, there's room for humor.
Even in the later sections of the film, there's tremendous creativity.
From the staging of battle scenes and explosions to the use of visual metaphors.
To make sure Major Seversky made his presentation as persuasively as possible,
Walt hired a professional director, a man of long experience on stage and in Hollywood,
H.C. Potter, to film these lecture segments.
Potter's many movie credits include
Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House,
The Farmer's Daughter, Hell's A'Poppin', and the story of Vernon and Irene Castle.
But more importantly, he was a flier himself, and already acquainted with its star.
He certainly did his job well in this movie, because Seversky comes off quite well, and doesn't seem stiff or severe.
When I interviewed Mr. Potter years ago, he had fond memories of Seversky, whom he knew as Sasha.
But he also remembered he had to shoot those sequences at night because Walt didn't have sufficient soundproofing to drown out the noise from Lockheed Aircraft nearby.
Potter's approach was to make
Seversky's speeches seem as far from a lecture as possible.
So he gave him lots of movement and other suggestions to make the speeches seem as casual as possible.
He especially remembered one night, when Sasha couldn't hit his marks, the places where the camera and lighting were set up for him.
He said, "Hank, how can I remember the words,
"the expression, the meaning, the walking without limping," because he had one wooden leg,
"and hit these marks,
"and think of what I'm saying at the same time?"
Potter replied,
"When you're flying airplanes,
"you're flying a plane, you're navigating,
"you're looking at the ground to see if you're going
"where you're supposed to be going.
"You're listening to the radio, watching for other planes,
"and checking your instruments, all at the same time. "
He concluded in a mock Russian accent,
"Your model should be,
'Dewide the attention'."
Seversky loved that, and from that time on before every shot, the crew would chant,
"Dewide the attention. "
Movie critics weren't crazy about the film.
Walt Disney's own distributor, RKO, didn't want to release it.
So Walt put the film in theaters through United Artists.
But the most important response to the movie came from Winston Churchill.
When he flew to Quebec for an Allied conference, and learned that President Roosevelt hadn't seen the movie, he and Air Marshal Tedder prodded him until he ordered that a print be sent to him.
H.C. Potter was told by Walt that it was only after
Roosevelt saw Victory Through Air Power, that our country made the commitment to long-range bombing.
And that, after all, was the reason
Walt committed to making this movie in the first place.
Because of its topicality, the Disney Studio decided to keep this film in the vaults at the close of World War ll.
Only the history of aviation sequence was seen in the years since then.
It's with great pleasure that we present
Victory Through Air Power, in its entirety.

Princess Iron Fan
Journey to the West is a wonderful children's story, but the world often misunderstands it as a fantasy novel.
This film was made for the purpose of training the hearts and minds of children.
The story is pure, untainted by fantasy.
Fiery Mountain blocking the path of Tang Seng's company is a metaphor for the difficulties in life.
In order to overcome them, one must keep faith.
Everybody must work together in order to obtain the palm leaf fan and put out the flames.
Tripikata True Sutra
It's already autumn, how can it still be so warm?
Fool, don't talk rubbish. We should hurry and get on our way.
Wukong, where is this place?
We must pass through here to continue westwards, that much is certain.
Might we have taken the wrong path?
Why is it so hot here?
Master, look!
Isn't that a house up ahead?
Let's go in and rest for a while, OK?
This place is called Fiery Mountain.
The fire stretches for hundreds of miles.
Not single straw of grass can grow here.
The four seasons of the year are all warm.
You couldn't pass through the mountain even with a head of copper and arms of iron.
What kind of place is this? Master, don't worry!
The three of us are all strong enough to pass!
Master, I'll go and have a look!
Wukong, what was it like?
Bad, bad, very bad.
If I were any slower the fur on my tail would have been burned off.
Noble host, the fires here are so big.
How can you grow any crops?
A thousand miles from here lives Princess Iron Fan.
She has a palm leaf fan.
Wave the fan once and the fire goes out.
Twice and the wind starts blowing.
Three times and the rain starts coming down.
In the following period we plant and harvest.
However, asking that princess to come is certainly no simple matter.
Where does she live?
She lives in Palm Leaf Cave at Emerald Cloud Mountain.
Does she live there alone?
Doesn't she have a husband?
Her husband is Bull Demon King.
What, her husband is Old Bull?
Fool, you know him? Come with me to borrow the fan!
Actually... Old Bull doesn't live there.
Looking for his woman when he isn't home isn't very... appropriate.
You... you... the two of you go.
I... I'll stay here and serve Master.
Sha Wujing, go with your two fellow apprentices.
Palm Leaf Cave
Fool, I always go first.
This time it's your turn!
Junior! I always go first, this time it's your turn!
Senior...
I'm asking you to make a small effort for Master. Can't you do that?
Hurry up!
Simple monk, where did you come from?
The Great Sage... Tang Seng... wants your princess...
Nonsense!
Senior... why don't you go instead?
Fool, you go!
Senior, why don't you go?
Lazy fool!
Great God of Thunder! Don't kill me, let me go!
Go tell your princess that Sun Wukong has come to borrow the fan.
Yes, yes! Let me loose, I'll go at once.
Grandma, there's a Sun Wukong outside asking to borrow the fan.
Quickly fetch my sword.
Sun Wukong, you hurt my son!
You dare come here to meet your death?
I've never met you before, how could I have harmed your son?
My son Red Child's life was ruined, wasn't that your doing?
Your son is with the Goddess of Mercy now, how can you say that I hurt him?
Enough rubbish! Come here and let me chop you with my sword.
If you can take it I'll lend you the fan.
Really?
Stop! Quickly give me the fan!
Great Sage, weren't you going west? Why have you come back here?
Princess Iron Fan blew me here with a single wave of her fan.
That's truly amazing, Great Sage. I have something for you.
This is a wind pearl. When you use it, your heart will become steady as a rock.
Princess Iron Fan won't be able to move you.
Great Sage, come and have a look.
Thank you.
Senior... where... where has he... been blown to?
Who cares about him? Let the monkey handle himself. Let's go.
Senior... senior...
You... you...
Where were you blown to by that old lady?
Fool, now it's definitely your turn to go.
I'm not going, a single wave of her fan could blow me to some faraway land.
Maybe it's better if you go again.
I won't go.
Next time I won't let you off!
This time I won't move no matter how much you wave, as sure as I call myself am a man!
Senior, how come this time her fan couldn't move you?
Let's break our way in.
Quickly bring out the fan for Sun Wukong!
Sun Wukong, where are you?
I'm in your stomach!
Sun Wukong, spare me!
Only if you give me the fan!
I promise, I'll give it to you. Please come out!
Hurry up and bring the fan.
We've brought out the fan.
Why haven't you come out?
Open your mouth and I'll come out.
Sun Wukong, why haven't you come out?
Here I am. Lend me the fan for a while, I'll return it.
Master has been waiting long enough, let's get going!
Scripture, what is scripture?
Scriptures are the principles that link heaven and earth.
They are the principles of man.
Only he who holds these principles can rid himself of pain and live a good life, live a true and honest life.
Conversely, he who does not know these principles, will live a life full of misery.
Even his son or grandson will not achieve happiness.
Why am I going to get the scripture?
Because men nowadays are trapped in misery.
In order to achieve this goal, we are going to appear before the Tang emperor and discuss this very complicated matter.
Did you get the palm leaf fan?
We have it.
Is this it?
Noble hosts, now that we have the fan, we will take our leave.
Hold on.
Everyone, I would like to ask Sage Seng to stay here for a few more days.
Do you agree?
Agreed!
Thank you for your kindness.
But the sooner I leave the sooner we can complete our task.
Very well, will the honorable apprentice first go to Fiery Mountain.
After extinguishing the flames, continue to follow Sage Seng.
All right, go ahead!
Princess Iron Fan is really despicable, she gave us a fake fan!
I'll kill her for sure!
No, killing her is the wrong thing to do.
I won't let you kill anyone.
Let's think of something else.
Senior, how could you be fooled by her?
After making such an effort all we got was a fake fan.
Ridiculous, ridiculous.
Then you go!
OK, I'll go, I'll go, I'm going!
I'll go find Bull Demon King.
This is a good solution.
Partner, what do you think?
We'll see how you do.
What do you think, am I pretty today?
Beautiful, my baby.
Accompany me for a walk outside the cave, all right?
My baby, why don't you go by yourself.
Why of course, I'm just a plain country girl.
Taking me outside might cause you to lose face.
Baby, what are you saying?
You go ahead, I'll come out in a while, all right?
Emerald Cloud Cave
Goddess, you're truly an angel come down from heaven.
Who... who are you?
I've come from Palm Leaf Cave to look for Bull Demon King.
Let go of me!
Goddess, slow down!
Emerald Cloud Cave
Baby, who has bullied you?
You!
How could I bully you?
Why don't you go back to Palm Leaf Cave?
It would spare you some embarrassment.
They often send people to look for you, and bully me.
Has there been someone here to look for me?
There's a pig monk outside looking for you.
He almost scared me to death.
How can this be? Wait while I go out to have a look.
Bull, old friend!
There's a very beautiful young lady in here.
Hey, that's my woman! Why have you come to bother her?
Oh, I didn't know, please forgive me!
You didn't know, so I can't blame you. Off you go!
No, no. I still have something I need you to help me with.
We were on our way to retrieve the scriptures when we arrived at Fiery Mountain.
Please ask your wife to lend us the palm leaf fan for a while.
Absolutely not! Tang Seng and Sun Wukong are my son's enemies.
I'd love to take my revenge on them.
Your son is with the Goddess of Mercy now, please don't fight.
All right, since we are old friends, I won't fight you.
Now go away!
Baby, that pig monk is a friend of mine.
He wasn't sent from Palm Leaf Cave at all.
I don't believe you.
I'm not lying to you!
Where is that monk now?
I've already scared him away.
Palm Leaf Cave
The king has returned!
Where's grandma?
She's inside.
By what honor has the king come to visit today?
I heard that Sun Wukong and Tang Seng are coming here.
I'm afraid they want to use the palm leaf fan to pass Fiery Mountain.
That monkey is the one who harmed our son.
I'll get him sooner or later, we will have our revenge.
Darling, why are you crying?
That monkey has already been here.
I refused to give him the fan.
I don't know how, but he got inside my stomach.
It hurt so bad I thought I would die.
At last I had no choice but to give him the fan.
That's terrible, how could you give him the fan?
I gave him a false one.
A false one?
A banquet to celebrate the king's return
Please drink the fine wine.
The chicken is fragrant, the duck is beautiful, and the pig is fat.
I try my best to sing, I try my best to dance.
You must also try your best to drink.
My king! You dumped the old one.
You love another woman.
Countless tears were spilled for you.
When the light is out and the curtain is dropped, you will sleep alone.
You too will taste loneliness.
Pardon me for not making you company.
Even if we are on the same bed, we will sleep under separate sheets.
King, I'm drunk.
Darling, where did you put the real fan?
That monkey is very deceitful, and the pig has even greater skill.
If you're not careful they might trick you.
Our treasure is right here.
King, what are you thinking about? Why don't you take it?
My treasure.
Emerald Cloud Cave
Baby, have another cup. Drink.
Gold Dragon King has asked me to drink with him tonight
Then you should go.
That's right.
You should prepare the golden eyed beast for grandpa.
I will.
You should drink a little less tonight.
Otherwise I won't be able to wake you up.
It's terrible, grandpa's golden eyed beast has disappeared!
Are you all deaf and blind?
How could it just disappear?
Baby, don't mind them.
I'm afraid Zhu Bajie might have stolen it.
Maybe I should go over to Palm Leaf Cave.
What? You've had this planned all along.
You still want to go over to that shameless woman?
Please baby, don't cry.
I'll be back soon.
Palm Leaf Cave
Come over here, drink a little!
Now I can relax.
We don't have to worry about our treasure being stolen.
Even if they stole it, they wouldn't know to pull the silk thread.
Having just a pearl won't be of any use.
Pulling the thread will turn it into a fan, right?
King, you're drunk.
You forgot about your own treasure, and are asking me.
Lady, look at who I am.
Who are you?
I am Tang Seng's second apprentice, Zhu Bajie.
Sorry about bothering you, and thanks!
Bye!
Bull's wife is too flirtatious.
All her underlings are handsome.
Old Pig almost couldn't take it.
Using clever tricks and tactics,
I stole their treasure away.
This is a great accomplishment.
Sandy should be on his knees.
Monkey should learn from me.
Even Master will be astonished.
Old Pig is truly masterful.
Old Pig is truly masterful.
Fool, how are things going?
Not only did I get the fan,
Princess Iron Fan was my wife for half a day, too.
You got a good deal.
Hey, let me see the fan.
Why did you shrink it?
Old Pig, you do recognize me, right?
Stop joking around with me.
Who's joking around with you?
Fool, how did it go?
It was all for nothing.
Wuneng, did you borrow the fan?
I found Bull Demon King, but he refused.
Then, I turned into his look-alike.
I tricked Princess Iron Fan into giving me the fan.
But then Old Bull turned into your look-alike and tricked me into giving it back.
Old Bull's skills are great.
I got beaten up by him, too.
How could you get the fan and still be such a fool?
Not everything revolves around you!
Don't fight, we should quickly think of a solution.
In which... which direction is there no fire?
Of east, south, west, north, there's fire only to the west.
So we have no option but to go back.
This path is blocked, what other options do we have?
Bajie, don't talk like that.
There will always be obstacles in our path.
To complete our sacred task we must be strong in our faith.
We can't change our goal half way just because we encounter some obstacles.
The reason that we've been defeated is that we haven't worked together.
If the three of you work as one, put your strength together to fight Bull Demon King, then you will certainly be victorious.
We have heard the order of Master and will fight Bull Demon King to the end. to... to the end.
That's excellent!
We have all been through hardships.
I hope everyone will make an effort together with my disciples to defeat Bull Demon King and put out the flames of Fiery Mountain.
Otherwise this misery will never end.
We have heard the order of Master, to seek happiness for all.
Everyone work together!
All right!
Grandma, it's terrible!
Grandpa has been trapped, come quickly and look!
The fight's not over yet, not over.
Careful, careful.
Beast, all you have to is give us the fan and we'll spare your life.
Old Bull, where is the fan? Hand it over!
My... my wife... has it.
Darling, darling!
Save me, hurry!
Give them the fan.
King! All right, all right!
Wukong, you go one more time!
The End
Up in the sky, look!
- It's a bird.
- It's a plane.
It's Superman!
Faster than a streak of lightning.
More powerful than the pounding surf.
Mightier than a roaring hurricane.
This amazing stranger from the planet Krypton...
...the Man of Steel...
...Superman!
Possessing remarkable physical strength...
...Superman fights a never-ending battle for truth and justice...
...disguised as a mild-mannered newspaper reporter Clark Kent.
Flash. Following closely in the wake of a series of baffling crimes...
...the body of an elderly man has been found in the marsh flats outside the city.
He has been identified as the watchman at the Metropolis Munitions Plant.
There's a story, or I'm no reporter.
He is believed to be the victim of an organized ring of saboteurs.
More news later.
Sounds like there might be a story at the plant, Lois.
Lois? Me name is Louis, not Lois.
Gee whiz, everybody interpolates me name wrong.
It's Louis, L-O-U-l-S. Lois.
Louise. Lucy.
Now I'm so mixed up
I don't know who I am.
Okay, watchman, take your post in the main shop.
- And be on the alert.
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
Oh, pardon me.
Report upstairs, 12:00. Very important.
Report upstairs, 12:00. Very important.
I wonder what the big shot wants.
That was a good job you did on the watchman last night.
Now how about that dynamite charge under the shops?
It's wired to the switch on the plant floor below.
When the new watchman pulls that switch tonight, the whole place will...
Get that girl.
All right, men, now load in the dynamite.
Jones speaking.
Hello, Jones, we're ready for the test.
Send out the torpedo immediately.
Immediately.
Here comes the torpedo now.
And that old hulk out there is the target.
Naturally, for experimental purposes, there is no explosive in the torpedo.
Okay, stand by.
Ready.
Fire!
Miss Lane. Miss Lane?
Are you all right?
Superman, they're about to blow up the plant.
Freddie, throw that switch.
Superman!
Superman. Look out!
Well, pop, Superman put an end to their little act.
And this puts an end to yours...
...Clark Kent.
Through the snow and sleet and hail... through the blizzard, through the gale... through the wind and through the rain... over mountain, over plain... through the blinding lightning flash... and the mighty thunder crash... ever faithful, ever true... nothing stops him.
He'll get through.
Look out for Mr Stork that persevering chap
He'll come along and drop a bundle in your lap
You may be poor or rich
It doesn't matter which
Millionaires, they get theirs like the butcher and the baker
So look out for Mr Stork and let me tell you, friend
Don't try to get away
He'll find you in the end
He'll spot you out in China or he'll fly to County Cork
So you'd better look out for Mr Stork
Look out for Mr Stork
He's got you on his list
And when he comes around it's useless to resist
Remember those quintuplets and the woman in the shoe
Maybe he's got his eye on you
All aboard! All aboard!
All aboard! Let's go!
Casey Junior's comin'down the track
Comin'down the track with a smoky stack
Hear him puffin' comin'round the hill
Casey's here to thrill every Jack and Jill

- What a temper.
Oh, what did I do?
Well, tell me.

- Perfectly harmless remark.
I just said that they're funny, and they are funny.
- They certainly are.
- After all, who cares... about her precious little Jumbo?
Jumbo? You mean Dumbo.
Dumbo.
- Dumbo, I say.
- That's good.
- Dumbo! That's good.
- Dumbo.
I think I can. I think I can.
I think I can. I think I can.
I think I can. I think I can.
I think I can.
I thought I could. I thought I could.
I thought I could. I thought I could.

We work all day
We work all night
We never learned to read or write
We're happy-hearted roustabouts
Hike, ugh, hike, ugh hike, ugh, hike
When other folks have gone to bed
We slave until we're almost dead
We're happy-hearted roustabouts
Hike, ugh, hike, ugh hike, ugh, hike
We don't know when we get our pay
And when we do we throw our pay away
When we get our pay we throw our money all away
We get our pay when children say
With happy hearts
It's circus day today
Then we get our pay just watching kids on circus day
Muscles aching
Back near breaking
Eggs and bacon's what we need

Oh
Jostling and juggling.
Fifteen minutes!
Step right up and get your tickets.
Hurry, hurry now.
Hurry to the big sideshow.
That's why you go under the big top.
Fifteen big attractions that you can't see anywhere else in the world!
The greatest collection in the entire world.
And the greatest comedies are featured and assembled for your entertainment.
Ain't that the funniest thing you ever saw? Look at his ears.
Hey, guys, lookit!
Smitty's an elephant!
- Aw, let me see!
- Boo!
- You can't hide him from us.
- Yeah, his ears are still stickin' out.
- Come on!
- We wanna see him!
- We wanna laugh.
- Sure, that's what we came for.
Hey, the biggest slingshot in the world.
- Hey! Cut that out!
- Hey, let's get out of here.
- You're hurting me! Help!
- Here, you! What's going on?
Down. Mrs Jumbo, down!
Surround her. Tie her down.
Get down!
Calm down! Tie her down!
Darling, it was so funny.
Oh, my dear, can you bear it?
When she doused the ringmaster,
I just thought I'd die.
Well, personally, I think she went a bit too far.
After all, one mustn't forget one is a lady.
- Oh, you're right, dear. Yes.
- Oh, that's very true.
Oh, well, I suppose that's mother love.
But it's certainly no excuse for what she did.
Mother love might cover a multitude of sins.
It's true, my dear, and she has such a streak in...
A guy can't eat in peace.
Yes, but mother love does...
Gab, gab, gab.
Always gossipin'.
Girls, girls! Listen!
Have I got a trunk full of dirt.
- Well, darling, tell us all.
- Go on, go on.
Well, I heard today that they have put her in solitary confinement.
- No!
- You don't mean it!
Oh, how awful for her!
Well, I-I must say,
I-I don't blame her for anything.
You're absolutely right.
It's all the fault of that little...
F-R-E-A-K.
Yes, him with those ears that only a mother could love.
What's the matter with his ears?
I don't see nothin' wrong with 'em.
I think they're cute.
Ladies, ladies!
It's no laughing matter at all.
Oh. Oh, she's right, girls.
Don't forget that we elephants have always walked with dignity.
His disgrace is our own shame.
- Yes, that's true. That's very true.
- Oh, indeed it is.
Well, frankly, I wouldn't eat at the same bale of hay with him.
- No. Right.
- Me either, dearie.
- I should say.
- Nor I. That's just how I feel about it.
Here he comes now.
Hmm. Pretend you don't see him.
Shh.
How do ya like that?
Givin' him the cold shoulder.
Poor little guy.
There he goes, without a friend in the world.
Nobody to turn to.
Oh, I'll do somethin' about this.
A mouse!
So ya like to pick on little guys, huh?
Well, why don't you pick on me?
A proud race.
Overstuffed hay bags!
Boo!
Still afraid of a mouse.
Ho-ho, boy.
Wait'll I tell the little guy.
Where is he? Oh. Hey, Dumbo.
You can come out now.
Golly. Maybe I scared him too.
Look, Dumbo. I'm your friend.
Come on out, won't ya?
You're not really afraid of little me, are ya?
Ya are?
Must've overdid it in there.
Don't know my own strength sometimes.
Dumbo. Look what I got for ya.
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
Ya gotta come out first.
Too bad ya don't trust me,
'cause I thought... uh, well, you... you and me, uh, we might get your mother out of the clink.
Oh, but I guess you wouldn't be interested. So long, Dumbo.
Well, that's more like it.
Ya know, your ma ain't crazy.
She's just broken-hearted.
It ain't nobody's fault you got them big ears.
Uh-oh. Boy, I stepped in it that time.
Aw, gee, Dumbo.
I think your ears are beautiful.
Sure. As a matter of fact,
I think they're very decorative.
You know, lots of people with big ears are famous.
Ho-ho, boy.
All we gotta do is build an act.
Make ya a star. A headliner!
Dumbo the Great!
Uh-oh. The great what?
Ya know, Dumbo, we gotta get an idea.
Not just any idea.
Something colossal, like, uh...
Have I got an idea!
What an idea!
Huh. He never had an idea in his life.
Just visualize:
One elephant climbs up... on top of another elephant until finally... all 17 elephants... have constructed an enormous pyramid... of pachyderms.
I step out.
I blow the whistle.
- Yeah.
- The trumpets are trumpeting.
- Yeah.
- And now... comes the climax!
Yeah? What is the climax?
Hmm. I don't know.
I knew he never had nothin'.
Well, maybe it comes to me... in a vision while I dream.
- Good night, Joe.
- Good night, Boss.
Climax.
Climax! Dumbo, you're a climax.
I'll be back in a minute.
I'm gonna take care of your future.
I am the voice of your subconscious mind.
Your inspiration.
Now, concentrate.
Remember?
Your pyramid of elephants... are standing in the ring waitin' for a climax.
- Climax.
- You are now getting that climax.
- Climax.
- How's the reception?
Comin' through okay? Good.
Suddenly, from the sidelines, comes your climax.
- Climax.
- Gallopin' across the arena.
- Arena.
- He jumps from a springboard... to a platform.
At the very pinnacle of your pyramid, he waves a flag... for a glorious finish!
- Finish?
- And who is your climax?
The little elephant with the big ears!
The world's mightiest midget mastodon! Dumbo!
What?
- Dumbo.
- Dumbo.
- Dumbo.
- Dumbo.
- Dumbo.
- Dumbo.
I got it! I got it!
Ladies and gentlemen... we will now present for your entertainment... the most stupendous, magnificent... super-colossal spectacle.
On this tiny... little, insignificant ball... we will construct for you... a pyramid, not of wood, not of stone...
To hear him talk, you'd think he was going to do it.
- But a living, breathing...
- The stuffed shirt.
Pyramid of ponderous, pulsating... pulchritudinous pachyderms!
I give you the elephants.
Aren't we a bit clumsy?
Gaining a little weight, aren't you, honey?
You're no cream puff yourself, dearie.
Quiet up there.
Tend to your work, girls.
Take your foot out of my eye, clumsy ox.
Steady, girls.
Boy, that was a close one.
They're almost ready now, Dumbo.
Don't forget to wave that flag.
Okay, okay.
Don't wave it no more. I saw ya.
Now, look. All ya gotta do is run out, see?
Jump on the springboard.
All right, now show me just how you're gonna do it.
That's it. Attaboy.
That's the stuff. Come on.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! Dumbo!
Oh, those ears.
We gotta do somethin', quick.
Ladies and gentlemen... you have now seen the impossible... accomplished in front of your faces.
Seven jungle giants... each one weighing not...
That windbag!
- Why doesn't he come to the point?
- 7,500 pounds!
And now, I present... the world's smallest little elephant... who will spring from this springboard... in one spring... to the top of this pyramid, waving his little flag... for a grand climax!
Ladies and gentlemen...
I give you Dumbo!
Go on! Get goin'!
What's the matter with you?
Dumbo! That's your cue!
You're on, Dumbo.
Out of my way, assassin!
- Dear!
- Ohh.
I never thought I'd live to see the big top fall.
Because of that Dumbo,
I never can show my face there again.
Oh, look at my beautiful tail!
I'd just like to spank the daylights out of him...
Ah! Oh! Oh! Ohh.
Oh, that won't be necessary, dearie.
They fixed him good.
- What do you mean?
- Wh-What did they do?
- Did they beat him?
- What is it, darling?
- Tell us.
- Come, come. I demand to know.
Oh. Well, they've gone and made him...
- Oh, dear, I just can't say it.
- Out with it!
Made him a clown.
A clown?
- No!
- Yes.
Oh, the shame of it.
Let us take the solemn vow.
From now on, he is no longer... an elephant.
Please! Help me save my poor baby!
Whoo! Save my child!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Where are you? Yoo-hoo!
Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Save my ba...
- Come on! Jump!
- We'll save you. Hurry up!
- Hurry up!
- We'll save you. Go on.
- Jump!
- We'll save ya.
Whew! Boy, oh, boy, did we wow 'em out there!
- What a performance!
- Are we good?
Thirteen curtain calls.
Thirteen!
Yeah, sure brought down the house, all right.
Oh, Mama, did we panic 'em.
Ask me, Joey. Go ahead. Ask me.
You said it.
We rolled 'em in the aisles.
- Boy, oh, boy, what a act.
- Oh, "what a act" is right.
Stupendous, I calls it.
They'll have more respect for us clowns now.
- Yeah, yeah, you bet.
- Here, boys.
This calls for a real celebration.
Come and get it.
- Poison! Am I thirsty.
- I could use one of them myself.
- This one's on Dumbo.
- Yeah, Dumbo.
- Dumbo!
- Here's plaster in his eyes.
See? They're drinkin' a toast to ya.
Yeah. You're a big hit.
Why, uh, you're terrific.
Oh, you're colossal. Stupendous.
Come on. Alley-oop.
I gotta wash behind your ears.
You oughta be proud.
You're a success.
Look. A peanut!
Come on. Eat it.
Got lots of vitamins.
Give ya a lot of, uh, pep.
Oh-ho-ho.
I forgot to tell ya.
Why, we're goin' over to see your mother.
I made an appointment for ya.
Didn't I tell ya? Huh!
Just like me. I must have forgot.
Come on. Get your hat.
Oh. Right over there.
Cosy little place, ain't it?
Mrs Jumbo. I hope she's in.
Someone to see ya.
Baby mine
Don't you cry
Baby mine
Dry your eyes
Rest your head
Close to my heart
Never to part
Baby of mine
Little one
When you play
Don't you mind

Baby mine
Baby mine
Here ya are.
Pour it in me slipper, Joey.
Boy, I can't get over the way we rolled 'em in the aisles.
- Just wait'll we hit the big town.
- This gives me an idea.
Let's raise the platform the elephant jumps off of.
Yeah! If they laugh when he jumps 20 feet... they'll laugh twice as hard if he jumps 40 feet.
- Yeah, that's right. That's right.
- Simple mathematics.
- Let's make it 80 feet.
- Don't be a piker. 180.
- Make it 300.
- A thousand.
- Yeah, that's good.
- Hey, be careful.
- You'll hurt the little guy.
- Aw, go on.
- Elephants ain't got no feelings.
- No, they're made of rubber.
This idea is sensational.
Let's go tell the boss.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Come on. Let's go.
Hey, hey!
Let's hit him for a raise.
Yeah, sure.
This is worth real dough.
Oh, we're gonna hit the big boss for a raise
Yes, we're gonna hit the big boss for a raise
Oh, we're gonna get more money
'cause we know that we're funny
We're gonna hit the big boss for a raise
I know how ya feel, Dumbo, but you gotta pull yourself together.
What would your mother think of ya, if she saw you crying like this?
Remember, you come of a proud race.
Why you're a-a-a... a pachyderm... and pachyderms don't cry.
What's cryin' get ya anyhow?
Nothin' but the hiccups.
There. Ya see?
Well, ain't nothin' a little water won't cure.
Oops-a-daisy. We'll have ya fixed up in a jiffy.
Come on.
Here. Take a trunk full.
Listen, little fella.
We may have had a lot of hard luck up till now... but you and me is gonna do big things together.
Hold your breath. Why, your mother's gonna be so proud of ya.
I'm gonna be proud of ya too.
The whole circus is gonna be proud of ya. Now, what do ya think of that?
Swallow it.
Ho-ho. They can't keep us down.
Oh, I guess you had one little one left over.
Dumbo, we'll bounce back so ha...
Hey, what's the matter with you?
What kind of water is this, anyhow?
Balloonies.
Hiya, George.
Whee!
That's a pretty schstrick schlick.
All right. Let's see ya blow a square one, pal.
Say, that's very, very clever.
Now blow a great big one.
That's a pretty sh... Hey!
Dumbo.
You see what I see?
Look out, look out
Pink elephants on parade
Here they come
Hippity-hoppity
They're here and there
Pink elephants everywhere
Look out, look out
They're walking around the bed on their head
Clippity-cloppity
Arrayed in braid
Pink elephants on parade
- What'll I do
- What'll I do
What an unusual view
I can stand the sight of worms and look at microscopic germs
But Technicolour pachyderms is really too much for me
I am not the type to faint
When things are odd or things are quaint
But seein'things you know there ain't
Can certainly give you an awful fright
What a sight
Chase 'em away, chase 'em away
I'm afraid, need your aid
Pink elephants on parade
- Hey, hey, hey
- Pink elephants
Pink elephants
Pink elephants
- Well, looky here, looky here.
- My, my.
Why, this is most irregular.
Well, I just can't believe my eyes.
- They ain't dead, is they?
- No. Dead people don't snore.
Or do they?
Uh, wh-what's all the ruckus?
Come on.
Step aside, brother.
Uh, what's cookin' 'round here?
What's the good news?
What's fryin', boy?
- Just look down there, brother.
- And prepare yourself for a shock.
- Well, hush my beak!
- Go ahead. Wake 'em up, brother.
Yeah. Find out what they're doin' up here.
- Yeah.
- And "ax" them what they want.
Okay, boys. Leave it to me.
Ohh! Those pink elephants.
Ho! Pink elephants? Mm-mmm!
What's so funny? What are you boys doin' down here, anyway?
What are we doin' down here?
Well, hear him talk.
Go on.
Fly up a tree where you belong.
- Say, look here, Brother Rat.
- Brother Rat?
Now listen. I ain't your brother and I ain't no rat, see?
Uh-huh. And I suppose you... and no elephant ain't up in no tree, either.
No! No, me and no tree ain't up no... Huh?
Tree?
Yo!
Dumbo.
Dumbo. Wake up.
Wake up, Dumbo!
Don't look now, but I think we're up in a tree.
Aw, don't pay no attention to them scarecrows.
Come on, Dumbo.
Let's get back to the circus.
So long, boy!
But I wonder how we ever got up in that tree, anyway.
Now, let's see.
Elephants can't climb trees, can they?
Nah, nah, that's ridiculous.
Couldn't jump up.
Mm-mm. It's too high.
Hey there, son.
Maybe you all flew up.
Maybe we flew up.
Yeah, maybe we...
That's it! Dumbo! You flew!
Boy, am I stupid.
Why didn't I think of this before?
Your ears. Just look at 'em, Dumbo.
Why, they're perfect wings.
The very things that held ya down are gonna carry ya up and up and up!
I can see it all now.
Dumbo, the Ninth Wonder of the Universe!
The world's only flyin' elephant!
Did you ever see an elephant fly?
- Well, I've seen a horsefly.
- Ah, I've seen a dragonfly.
- Hee-hee. I've seen a housefly.
- Yeah!
See, I've seen all that too.
I've seen a peanut stand and heard a rubber band.
I seen a needle that winked its eye.
But I be done seen about ever'thing
When I see a elephant fly
- What'd you say, boy?
- I said when I see a elephant fly

I seen a polka-dot railroad tie
But I be done seen

Fly
All right, you wise birds.
This has gone far enough.
Quiet, gentlemen.
The Reverend Rodent is gonna address you.
You oughta be ashamed of yourselves.
A bunch of big guys like you... pickin' on a poor little orphan like him.
Suppose you was torn away from your mother when you was just a baby... nobody to tuck you in at nights... no warm, soft, caressin' trunk to snuzzle into.
How would you like to be left out alone... in a cold, cruel, heartless world?
And why? I ask ya, why?
Just because he's got those big ears, they call him a freak.
The laughing stock of the circus.
Then when his mother tried to protect him... they threw her into the clink.
And on top of that, they made him a clown!
Socially, he's washed up.
Ah, but what's the use of talkin' to you cold-hearted birds?
Go ahead. Have your fun.
Laugh at him.
Kick him, now that he's down.
Go on!
We don't care.
Come on, Dumbo.
Hey, brother, w-w-wait a minute.
Uh, don't go away feelin' like that.
We done seen the light.
You boys is okay.
Please, you've done enough.
Well, but we's all fixin' to help you.
Uh, ain't that the truth, boys?
- Well, it sure is.
- Uh, yeah, that... You're right.
You wanna make the elephant fly, don't ya?
Well, you gotta use a lot of'chology.
You know, psychology.
Now, here's what you do.
First, you, uh...
Uh, bu...
And then, right after that, you, uh...
Use the magic feather.
Catch on?
The magic feather?
Yeah, I gotcha.
Dumbo! Look! Have I got it!
The magic feather!
Now you can fly!
Let's go. Let's go.
- Heave ho. Heave ho.
- Let's go, Dumbo.
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Come on now.
- Up, down. Up, down.
- Heave ho.
- One, two, One, two. One, two.
- Heave ho.
Faster, faster.
Get up flyin' speed.
Retract your landing gear.
Raise your fuselage.
Take off.
Aw, it's no use, Dumbo.
I guess it's just another one of their... Look!
Hot diggity! You're flyin'.
You're flyin'!
Uh, why, he flies just like a eagle.
That's better than a aeroplane.
Brother, now I've seen everything.
But I be done seen about everything
When I see a elephant fly
With the wind.
When I see a elephant
Fly
Dumbo, I knew you could do it!
Wait'll we get to the big town.
Boy, them city folks is sure in for a surprise.
Poor baby! Whoo!
- Come on! Jump! Come on!
- We'll save ya.
- Hurry up!
- We'll save ya!
- Come on! Jump!
- Come on!
Look at that house.
Dumbo, you're standing on the threshold of success.
Don't look down.
It'll make you dizzy.
Boy, are they in for a surprise.
Ho-ho.
Got the magic feather? Good.
Okay. Contact!
Take off!
Uh-oh. The magic feather!
Dumbo, come on. Fly.
Open them ears.
The magic feather was just a gag.
You can fly.
Honest, you can.
Hurry! Open 'em up!
Please!
Whee! We did it! We did it!
Let's show 'em, Dumbo.
Power dive.
Now, loop the loop.
You're makin' history!
I've seen a peanut stand heard a rubber band
I've seen a needle that winked its eye
But I be done seen
About everything
When I see an elephant fly
- Oh, my
- When I see
When I see
When I see an elephant fly
- Mmm, look at him go!

The Disney staff never tackled a more serious subject than the one dramatized in Education for Death, as its subtitle,
The Making of a Nazi, would indicate.
Based on a best-selling book, directed by Clyde Geronimi, and narrated by the then popular radio personality, Art Smith.
This film shows us how an innocent young boy is indoctrinated as a Nazi, and brainwashed into believing the party's warped ideology.
The Disney artists were used to animating fanciful characters, but this was something completely different.
Notice how well they stage each scene for dramatic impact.
Using shadows and silhouettes to emphasize the menace inherent in each phase of this saga.
While bringing realistic human characters to life was always their greatest challenge, they did an excellent job in this short.
Since this film was shown to general audiences, it was smart to include moments of humor.
But there's nothing funny about book burning.
And when we see boys acting genuinely cruel, it's shocking, just as it's meant to be.
The ending is as grim as any ever put on film.
What makes a Nazi?
How does he get that way?
Well, let's look into the process.
To begin with...
Nazi control over a German child... starts as soon as it's born.
A young German couple has come... to register the birth of their son.
Heil Hitler.
Heil Hitler!
Those documents are birth certificates... all the way back to their great-grandparents... proving, of course, that they are pure Aryan.
The mother wants to call her son Hans.
Here's the verboten list.
Mm-hmm.
Hans seems to be OK... for the time being.
This is their hereditary passport... with space for twelve future children.
A subtle hint-
Germany needs soldiers.
As a reward, they get a copy... of Germany's bestseller.
Now let's see what happens to one of Hitler's children.
Kindergarten... and little Hans learns the fairy tales... of the new order.
Remember the story of the sleeping beauty?
Hans was taught that the wicked witch... was democracy.
And Sleeping Beauty- who can she be?
Ah ha ha ha ha!
Aha!
Here comes the prince.
The prince is victorious.
Democracy has fled.
The prince breaks the magic spell with a kiss.
The beautiful princess is Germany.
Aah!
And the brave, handsome knight-
You know who he is.
Heil Hitler!
- Heil Hitler!
- Heil!
? Heil Hitler, heil Hitler?
Ahh.
? Heil Hitler, heil Hitler?
- Heil! Heil!
- Heil! Heil!
- Heil! Heil!
- Heil! Heil!
Heil! Heil! Heil!
Heil! Heil!
Ooh!
Ach!
Oh!
The moral of this Nazi fairy tale... seems to be that Hitler got Germany on her feet... climbed into the saddle... and took her for a ride.
The distortion of this tale has its purpose... in molding the young Nazi mind.
Hitler becomes Hans' idol.
Sieg heil!
Sieg heil! Sieg heil!
But one day,
Hans became sick.
His mother is praying that her son get well.
She knows that the unfit are taken away by the state... and are never heard of again.
Heil Hitler!
Heil Hitler.
Heil Hitler!
This superman has just reminded Hans' mother... that unless this mollycoddling stops... the state will have to step in and take over.
Hans recovered.
Back in school, he's giving his daily pledge... to fight, obey, and die for his Fuehrer... which pleases the Fuehrer very much.
And Herr Goering.
And Herr Goebbels, too.
Hans' schoolteacher is about to give the class... a little lesson in natural history.
Ahh.
Now let's see what they'll learn... from this little lesson.
Hans?
He said the poor rabbit.
Is he out of his mind?
What would the Fuehrer think of such a stupid answer?
What would
Herr Goering say?
And Herr Goebbels?
Now then, who can give the correct answer?
"The world belongs to the strong."
"And to the brutal."
"The rabbit is a coward and deserves to die."
They spit on the rabbit.
Nice kids.
Gut, gut.
He hates the rabbit!
There's no room for weaklings!
Hans is learning fast.
My, how he hates that rabbit.
Hans has come around... to the correct Nazi way of thinking.
Nice going, eh, Adolf?
Yes, this lesson is the basis for the Nazi creed.
For Germany will likewise destroy... all weak and cowardly nations.
"Germans are a super-race!
All others will be slaves!"
"Germans are unconquerable."
"They fear no one."
Listen to the fanatic cry.
"Today we own Germany!"
"Tomorrow, the whole world!"
Hans is now ready for the higher education... as decreed by the Fuehrer.
Marching and heiling, heiling and marching...
Hans grows up.
In him is planted no seed of laughter... hope, tolerance, or mercy.
For him, only heiling and marching... marching and heiling, as the years grind on.
Manhood finds him still heiling and marching.
But the grim years of regimentation... have done their work.
Now he's a good Nazi.
He sees no more than the party wants him to...
He says nothing but what the party wants him to say...
And he does nothing but what the party wants him to do.
And so he marches on... with his millions of comrades... trampling on the rights of others.
For now his education is complete-
His education for death.
When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires
Will come to you
If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
Fate is kind
She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfilment of
Their secret longing
Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in
And sees you through
When you wish
Upon a star
Your dreams
Come true
Pretty, huh?
I'll bet a lot of you folks don't believe that.
About a wish coming true, do you?
Well, I didn't either.
Of course, I'm just a cricket singing my way from hearth to hearth...
...but... let me tell you what made me change my mind.
One night, a long time...
Pardon me. Wait 'til I, I fix this thing here.
There.
One night, a long time ago...
...my travels took me to a quaint little village.
It was a beautiful night.
The stars were shining like diamonds...
...high above the roofs of that sleepy old town.
Pretty as a picture.
As I wandered along the crooked streets...
...there wasn't a soul to be seen.
The only sign of life was a lighted window...
...in the shop of a wood-carver named, uh, Geppetto.
So, I hopped over.
And looked in.
It was a shame to see a nice cheerful fire like that going to waste.
So what do I do?
I go in.
I looked around.
Of course, being in a strange place like that...
...I didn't know what to expect.
A cricket can't be too careful, you know.
Soon as I saw there was no one about, I made myself at home.
As I stood there warming my... myself, I took a look around.
Well, sir, you never saw such a place.
The most fantastic clocks you ever laid your eyes on.
And all carved out of wood.
And cute little music boxes, each one a work of art.
Shelf after shelf of toys and...
And then something else caught my eye.
A puppet!
You know, one of those marionette things...
...all strings and joints.
Cute little fella.
Ding, ding! Going up?
Good piece of wood too.
Well, now.
It won't take much longer.
Just a little more paint and he's all finished.
I think he'll be all right.
Don't you, Figaro?
Um, huh, uh, beg pardon.
See?
That makes a big difference.
Very good.
Very, very goo...
Well, you can't please everybody.
Now, I have just the name for you.
Pinocchio!
Do you like it, Figaro?
No? You do, don't you, Cleo?
Well, we'll leave it to little Woodenhead.
Do you like it?
That settles it!
Pinocchio it is!
Come on, now, we'll try you out.
Music, Professor!
Hey! Ow, ow, ow, ouch!
Ta-Ta-Take it easy there!
Oh, break it up, will you?
Lot of downbeats in there.
Little Woodenhead
Go play your part
Bring a littlejoy to every heart
Little do you know and yet it's true
That I'm mighty proud of you
Little wooden feet and best of all
Little wooden seat in case you fall
Oh-ho! How graceful!
My little Woodenhead
Cleo, meet Pinocchio.
Say, "How do you do?"
Say hello to Figaro.
Oops! Oh-ho-ho!
Up to mischief already.
You see what happens?
Boo!
Up we go!
You're a cute little fellow.
And that smile?
You know, I....
You rascal. Jealous, huh?
You know, Pinocchio, I think
Figaro is jealous of you.
Oh-ho, don't worry, Figaro.
I sti... Uh-oh.
I wonder what time it is.
It's getting late.
Come, now. We go to bed.
Good night, Pinocchio.
Little funny face.
Good night, Cleo, my little water baby.
Figaro.
You say good night too.
Go on.
Now go to sleep, my little mermaid.
Good night.
This is my idea of comfort.
Solid comfort.
Look at him, Figaro.
He almost looks alive.
Wouldn't it be nice if he was a real boy?
Oh, well.
Come on. We go to sleep.
Ah, Figaro.
I forgot to open the window.
Oh, Figaro! Look, look!
The wishing star!
Star light, star bright, first star I see tonight;
I wish I may, I wish I might...
...have the wish I make tonight.
Figaro, you know what I wish?
I wish that my little Pinocchio...
...might be a real boy.
Wouldn't that be nice?
Just think!
A real boy!
A very lovely thought.
But not at all practical.
A real...
...boy.
Quiet!
After all, enough's enough.
Now what's up?
Hey, what's going on here?
As I live and breathe, a fairy!
Mm-mmm.
Good Geppetto, you have given so much happiness to others.
You deserve to have your wish come true.
Little puppet made of pine...
...wake.
The gift of life is thine.
Whew! What they can't do these days!
I can move!
I can talk!
I can walk!
- Yes, Pinocchio, I've given you life.
- Why?
Because tonight, Geppetto wished for a real boy.
- Am I a real boy?
- No, Pinocchio.
To make Geppetto's wish come true will be entirely up to you.
Up to me?
Prove yourself brave, truthful and unselfish...
...and someday you will be a real boy.
A real boy!
That won't be easy.
You must learn to choose between right and wrong.
Right and wrong?
But how will I know?
- How will he know.
- Your conscience will tell you.
- What are conscience?
- What are conscience!
I'll tell ya!
A conscience is that still small voice that people won't listen to.
That's just the trouble with the world today, you see?
- Are you my conscience?
Who, me?
Would you like to be
Pinocchio's conscience?
Well, w... uh, I...
Very well.
What is your name?
Oh, Cricket's the name.
Jiminy Cricket.
- Kneel, Mr Cricket.
- Huh?
No tricks now.
I dub you
Pinocchio's conscience...
...lord high keeper of the knowledge of right and wrong...
...counsellor in moments of temptation...
...and guide along the straight and narrow path.
Arise, Sir Jiminy Cricket.
Well! Oh-ho-ho!
My, my!
Mmm. Say, that's pretty swell.
Gee... thanks.
But, uh, don't I get a badge or something?
- Well, we'll see.
- You mean maybe I will?
- I shouldn't wonder.
- Make it a gold one?
Maybe.
Now, remember, Pinocchio, be a good boy.
And always let your conscience be your guide.
Goodbye, milady.
Goodbye!
Not bad, says I.
Oh, yeah. Ho-ho-ho.
Almost forgot about you.
Well, Pinoke.
Maybe you and I had better have a little heart-to-heart talk.
Why?
- Well, you want to be a real boy, don't you?
- Uh-huh!
All right. Sit down, son.
- Now, you see, the world is full of temptations.
- Temptations?
Yep. Temptations.
They're the wrong things that seem right at the time.
But, uh, even though the right things may seem wrong sometimes...
...uh, sometimes the, the wrong things may be right at the wrong time.
Or, uh, visa versa.
Understand?
But I'm gonna do right!
Atta boy, Pinoke.
And I'm gonna help you.
And anytime you need me, you know, just whistle.
Like this.
Like this?
No, no. Try it again, Pinoke.
Like this?
No, son. Now, listen.
That's it! Come on, now, let's sing it!
When you get in trouble and you don't know right from wrong
Give a little whistle
Give a little whistle
When you meet temptation and the urge is very strong
Give a little whistle
Give a little whistle
Not just a little squeak
Pucker up and blow
- And if your whistle's weak, yell
- Jiminy Cricket?
Right! Take the straight and narrow path and if you start to slide
Give a little whistle
Give a little whistle
And always let your conscience be your guide
Take the straight and narrow path and if you start to slide
Give a little whistle
Give a little whistle
Whoo-hoo!
And always let your conscience be your guide
And always let your conscience be your guide
- Who is there?
- It's me!
Oh, it's me.
Shh, Figaro.
There's somebody in here.
Be careful now, Figaro.
He might spring out on us at any time.
He's in here somewhere.
Here I am!
Oh... Pinocchio.
How did you get down here?
- I fell down.
- Oh, you did.
Ohh! You're talking!
- N-N-N-No!
- Yes, and I can move too!
No, n-no, you, you can't.
I-I'm dreaming in my sleep.
W-W-Wake me up. Wake me up!
Now we see who is dreaming.
Go on. Say something.
Gee, you're funny.
Do it again!
- You do talk!
- Yes, the Blue Fairy came...
The Blue Fairy?
- And I got a conscience.
- A conscience!
And someday I'm gonna be a real boy!
A real boy! It is my wish.
It's come true!
Figaro, look!
He... He's alive. He can talk!
- Let's say hello to Figaro.
- Hello to Figaro.
Ohh. Oh, Cleo, I almost forgot.
Look! It's Pinocchio!
She's my little water baby.
Isn't she cute?
Yeah, cute.
This calls for a celebration.
Music!
You start one, Pinocchio.
Oh, boy. A party!
Mind if I cut in?
How about sitting out the next one, babe, huh?
Whoop! Hey, whoa, let me out!
Let me out!
Come, Cleo, join the party.
Dance!
Ooh, nice.
Gathering toys
For my little boy
Look! Pretty!
Help!
Wh-Wh-Wh-Where's the bucket?
Help! Water! Where's the water?
Here it is! I got it!
Here's water! Here's some water!
Help! Where's water?
That was close.
Maybe we'd better go to bed...
...before something else happens.
Little man, you've had a busy night.
Now, close your eyes and go to sleep.
Why?
Oh, everybody has to sleep.
Figaro goes to sleep... and Cleo...
...and besides, tomorrow you've got to go to school.
Why?
Oh, to learn things and...
...and get smart.
Why?
Because...
- Oh, look, Father! Look!
- Now, wait. Stand still now.
- What are those?
- Huh? Oh, those.
They are your schoolmates.
Girls and boys. Uh, no-now, get in...
- Real boys?
- Yes.
But hurry now.
Oh, oh, wai-wai-wait! Wait. Eh...
Here's an apple for your teacher. Now turn around...
...and let me look you over.
Huh? Oh, yeah, yeah.
Here.
Run along now.
Fig, wait!
Come back here, Figaro.
School is not for you.
Goodbye, Father.
Goodbye, son.
Hurry back.
Ah, Gideon, listen.
The merry laughter...
...of little innocent children wending their way to school.
Thirsty little minds rushing to the fountain of knowledge.
School, a noble institution.
What would this stupid world be without...
Well, well, well!
Stromboli!
So that old rascal's back in town, eh?
Remember, Giddy, the time
I tied strings on you...
...and passed you off as a puppet?
We nearly put one over on that old gypsy that time.
A little wooden boy.
Now, who'd have...
A wooden boy!
Look, Giddy, look!
It's amazing.
A live puppet without strings.
A thing like that ought to be worth a fortune to someone.
Now let me see.
That's it! Stromboli!
Why, that fat old faker would give his... Listen.
If we play our cards right, we'll be on Easy Street...
...or my name isn't Honest John.
Quick, we'll head him off.
Shh! Now's our...
No, no, stupid.
Don't be crude.
Let me handle this.
Here he comes.
Ah, yes, Skinny, as I was saying to the Duchess only yesterday...
Oh! Oh, how clumsy of me.
Oh, my, my, my, my.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
Oh, I do hope you're not injured.
- I'm all right.
- Oh, splendid.
Well, well, hmm.
Quite a scholar, I see.
Look, Giddy, a man of letters.
- Here's your book.
- I'm going to school.
School. Ah, yes.
Then you haven't heard of the easy road to success.
- Uh-uh.
- No?
I'm speaking, my boy, of the theatre.
Here's your apple.
Bright lights, music...
...applause, fame!
- Fame?
- Yes!
And with that personality, that profile, that physique...
...he's a natural born actor, eh, Giddy?
- But I'm going...
- Straight to the top.
Why, I can see your name in lights, lights six feet high.
- Uh... What is your name?
- Pinocchio.
Pinocchio! P-I-N... Eh, uh...
...U-O... Eh, P-I... Eh...
We're wasting precious time.
Come, on to the theatre.

Shh!
Why, my boy, huh, you must be seeing things.
Oh, no, that's my conscience. He...
Now, now, now.
Just calm down.
Why, there's nothing up there to be afraid of.
Oh!
Psst! Pinoke!
Psst! Pinoke! Over here.
- Over here.
- Oh, Jiminy!
- I'm going to be an actor.
- All right, son, take it easy now.
Remember what I said about temptation?
- Uh-huh.
- Well, that's him.
Oh, no, Jiminy, that's Mr Honest John.
Honest John?
Get this thing off.
Get me outta here!
Get me out of here!
Oh!
All right then, here's what we'll tell 'em:
You can't go to the theatre, say "Thank you just the same"...
...you're sorry but you've got to go to school.
Pinocchio!
Oh, Pinocchio!
Here they come, Pinoke.
Now, you tell 'em.
Oh, little boy!
Ah, there you are!
Now, where were we?
Ah, yes, on to the theatre!
Goodbye, Jiminy!
Goodbye!
- Hi diddle dee dee An actor's life for me
- Goodbye? Huh? Goodbye?
- Hey, Pinoke, you can't...
- A high silk hat and a silver cane
- A watch of gold with a diamond chain
- There he goes.
- Oh, what'll I do? I'll run and tell his father.
- Hi diddle dee day
- An actor's life is gay
- No, that'd be snitching.
I'll go after him myself.
Ladies and gentlemen...
...to conclude the performance of this great show...
...Stromboli the Master Showman... that's a-me...
...and by special permission of the management...
...that's a-me too...
...is presenting to you something...
...you will absolutely refuse to believe.
Well, looks like a sell-out.
Introducing the only marionette...
...who can sing and dance...
...absolutely without the aids of strings.
I hope so.
The one and only... Pinocchio!
Hmph! What a build-up.
I got no strings to hold me dow...
Go ahead, make a fool of yourself.
Then maybe you'll listen to your conscience.
Cute kid.
I got no strings to hold me down
To make me fret or make me frown
I had strings but now I'm free
There are no strings on me
Heigh-ho the merry-o
That's the only way to be
I want the world to know
Nothing ever worries me
I got no strings so I can have fun
- What I told you, huh?
- I'm not tied up with anyone
They got strings but you can see
There are no strings on me
You have no strings
Your arms is free
To love me by the Zuider Zee
Ja, ja, ja
If you would woo
I'd bust my strings for you
You got no strings
Comme ci, comme ca
Your savoir faire is ooo-la-la
I've got strings but entre nous
I'd cut my strings for you
Down where the Volga flows
There's a Russian rendezvous
Where me and Ivan go
But I'd rather go with you
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
- Hey!
- Hey!
There are no strings on me
Hmm, they like him.
He's a success.
Gosh, maybe I was wrong.
Well, guess he won't need me any more.
What does an actor want with a conscience anyway?
What could have happened to him?
Where could he be at this hour?
I'd better go out again and look for him.
And remember, nobody eats a bite until I find him.
I got-a no strings but I got-a the brain
I buy a new suit and I swing-a the chain
I eat-a the best and I drink-a champagne
I got-a no strings on me
- Bravo, Pinocchio!
- They like me.
Hmm, two hundred.
- You are sensational!
- Ya mean I'm good?
Ahh, three hundred.
You are colossal!
Does that mean I'm an actor?
Sure. I will push you in the public's eye.
Your face, she will be on everybody's tongue.
- Will she?
- Ye... Uh, huh?
What's this?
Ahhh!
For you, my little Pinocchio.
For me? Gee, thanks!
I'll run right home and tell my father.
Home?
Oh, sure. Going home to your father.
Oh, that is very comical!
- Ya mean it's funny?
- Oh, sure! Yes.
- I'll be back in the morning.
- Be back in the morning.
Going home.
There, this will be your home...
...where I can find you always.
- No, no, no!
- Yes, yes, yes!
To me you are belonging.
We will tour the world.
Paris. London.
Monte Carlo.
"Constantinopolee."
- No, no!
- Yes!
We start tonight!
Hmm.
You will make lots of money... for me!
And when you are growing too old...
...you will make good... firewood!
Let me outta here! I gotta get out! You can't keep me!
Quiet! Shut-a up...
...before I knock-a you silly!
Good night...
...my little wooden gold mine.
No! No, wait! Let me out!
I'll tell my father!
Giddy-up!
Get along there.
Jiminy!
Oh, Jiminy!
Oh, Jiminy, where are ya?
Jiminy Cricket!
Well, there he goes.
Sitting in the lap of luxury, the world at his feet.
Oh, well, I can always say I knew him when.
I'll just go out of his life quietly.
I would like to wish him luck though.
Sure! Why not?
Pinocchio.
Pinocchio!
It's me, your old friend Jiminy, remember?
Jiminy! Gee, I'm glad to see ya!
Pinocchio!
What's happened?
- What did he do to ya?
- Oh, he was mad.
He said he was gonna push my face in everybody's eye.
- Yeah?
- A-A-And just 'cause I'm a gold brick...
...he-he's gonna chop me into firewood!
Oh, is that so?
Now, don't you worry, son.
I'll have you out of here in no time at all.
Why, this is... eh, just as easy as... rollin' off a...
Kind of rusty.
- Needs a little oil!
- Needs a little oil, needs a little oil, a little oil.
That's what I said.
Must be one of the old models.
You mean, you can't open it?
Yeah.
Looks pretty hopeless.
It'll take a miracle to get us out of here.
Gee.
Pinocchio!
Pinocchio!
Giddy-up!
Pinocch...
A fine conscience
I turned out to be.
I should've listened to you, Jiminy.
No, it was my fault.
I shouldn't have walked out on you.
Guess I'll never see my father again.
Oh, buck up, son.
It could be worse.
Be cheerful, like me.
Aw, take it easy, son.
Come on, blow.
Thatta boy.
Oh, well, it stopped raining anyway.
Hey, that star again!
Uh, the lady, the... Ooh!
- The fairy!
- What'll she say?
- What'll I tell her?
- You might tell her the truth.
- Why, Pinocchio.
- Uh, eh, hello!
Sir Jiminy!
Well! Uh, this is a... a pleasant surprise. Ha-ha.
Pinocchio, why didn't you go to school?
School? Well, I... um...
Uh... Go ahead, tell her.
I was going to school
'til I met somebody.
- Met somebody?
- Yeah. Uh, two big monsters...
...with big green eyes!
- Why, I... I...
- Monsters?
Weren't you afraid?
No, ma'am.
But they tied me in a big sack.
You don't say!
And where was Sir Jiminy?
Eh, huh? Oh, Jiminy?
Hey, psst!
Leave me outta this.
They put him in a little sack.
- No!
- Yeah!
- How did you escape?
- I didn't.
They chopped me into firewood.
Oh! Oh, look!
My nose!
What's happened?
Perhaps you haven't been telling the truth, Pinocchio.
- "Perhaps"?
- Oh, but I have, every single word.
Oh, please help me!
I'm awful sorry.
You see, Pinocchio, a lie keeps growing and growing...
...until it's as plain as the nose on your face.
She's right, Pinoke.
You better come clean.
I'll never lie again.
Honest, I won't.
Please, Your Honor...
Uh, uh, I mean, Miss Fairy.
Give him another chance, for my sake.
Will ya, huh?
I'll forgive you this once.
But remember...
...a boy who won't be good might just as well be made of wood.
- We'll be good, won't we?
- We'll be good, won't we?
Very well. But this is the last time I can help you.
Gee, look, Jiminy, my nose!
Hey, we're free!
Come on, Pinoke!
I buy a new suit and I swing-a the cane
I eat-a the fish and I drink-a champagne
I got no strings on me
- Toodle-ooo, Stromboli.
- Goodbye, Mr Strombo...
Shh! Quiet! Let's get outta here before something else happens.
Hi diddle dee dee
An actor's life for me
A high silk hat and a silver cane
A watch of gold with a diamond chain
Hi diddle dee day
An actor's life is gay
It's great to be a celebrity
An actor's life for me
And the dummy fell for it...
...hook, line and sinker!
And he still thinks we're his friends.
And did Stromboli pay...
...plenty!
That shows you how low
Honest John will stoop...
...eh, Giddy?
Now, uh, coachman...
...what's your proposition?
Well...
...how would you blokes like to make some real money?
Well! And who do we have to, eh...
No, no!
Nothing like that.
You see...
I'm collecting stupid little boys.
- Stupid little boys?
- You know...
...the disobedient ones what play hookey from school.
And you see...
Yes.
Oh!
And I takes 'em to Pleasure Island!
Ah, Pleasure Island.
Pleasure Island?
But the law, suppose they...
No, no. There is no risk.
They never come back...
...as boys!
Now, I've got a coach load leaving at midnight.
We'll meet at the crossroads, and no double-crossing!
- No, sir.
- Scout around...
...and any good prospects you find, bring 'em to me.
- Yes, Chief.
- I'll pay you well.
- I got plenty of gold.
- Yes, yes.
No, sir, nothing can stop me now.
I'll make good this time.
- You'd better.
- I will. I'm going to school.
- That's the stuff, Pinoke.
- I'd rather be smart than be an actor.
Now you're talkin'! Come on, slowpoke, I'll race ya home.
Well, well, Pinocchio.
What's your rush?
I gotta beat Jiminy home.
Oh, hello.
Well, how is the great actor?
I don't wanna be an actor.
Stromboli was terrible.
- He was?
- Yeah, he locked me in a bird cage...
- He did?
- Uh-huh, but I learned my lesson.
I'm going...
Oh, you poor, poor boy.
You must be a nervous wreck.
That's it, you are a nervous wreck!
We must diagnose this case at once.
Quick, Doctor, your notebook.
Bless my soul.
Hmmm, mm-hmm.
My, my.
Just as I thought.
A slight touch of monetary complications...
...with bucolic semi-lunar contraptions of the flying trapezes.
Mm-hmm. Say "hippopotamus."
- Hi-ho-hotamus.
- I knew it!
Compound transmission of the pandemonium with percussion...
...and spasmodic frantic disintegration.
- Close your eyes. What do you see?
- Nothing.
- Open them. Now what do you see?
- Spots.
Aha! Now that heart.
Ooh, my goodness!
A palpitating syncopation of the killer diller...
...with the wicky wacky stomping of the floy joy.
Quick, Doctor, that report.
Ooh, this makes it perfectly clear!
My boy, you are allergic.
- Allergic?
- Yes, and there is only one cure.
- A vacation on Pleasure Island!
- Pleasure Island?
Yes, that happy land of carefree boys...
...where every day is a holiday!
- But I can't go. I...
- Why, of course you can go.
I'm giving you my ticket.
- Here.
- Thanks! But I'm...
Oh, tut-tut-tut-tut, I insist.
Your health comes first.
Come, the coach departs at midnight.
Hi diddle dee dee
It's Pleasure Isle for me
Where every day is a holiday
And kids have nothing to do but play
Pinoke!
Oh, Pinoke? Now where do you suppose he... Huh?
Pinocchio!
Hey! Come back!
Giddy-up!
Well...
...here we go again.
My name's Lampwick.
What's yours?
Pinocchio.
- Ever been to Pleasure Island?
- Uh-uh, but Mr Honest John gave me...
Me neither, but they say it's a swell joint. No school, no cops.
You can tear the joint apart, and nobody says a word.
- Honest John gave me...
- Loaf around, plenty to eat, plenty to drink.
- And it's all free!
- Honest John...
Boy, that's the place.
I can hardly wait!
Right here, boys!
Right here!
Get your cake, pie, dill pickles and ice cream.
Eat all you can. Be a glutton.
Stuff yourselves.
It's all free, boys. It's all free.
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry!
The Rough House.
The Rough House.
It's the roughest, toughest joint ya ever seen.
- Come in and pick a fight, boys.
- Oh, boy, a scrap!
Come on, let's go in and poke somebody in the nose.
- Why?
- Ah, just for the fun of it.
Okay, Lampy.
Tobacco Road. Tobacco Road.
Get your cigars, cigarettes and chewin' tobacco.
Come in and smoke your heads off.
There's nobody here to stop you.
Pinocchio!
Pinocchio! There's somethin'... phoney about all this.
I gotta get him outta here.
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry! See the model home.
It's open for destruction, and it's all yours, boys!
It's all yours!
What'd I tell ya?
Ain't this a swell joint?
Yeah! Bein' bad's a lot of fun, ain't it?
Yeah, uh-huh. Get a load of that stained-glass window.
All right now, hop to it, you blokes.
Come on, come on! Shut the doors and lock 'em tight.
Now get below and get them crates ready.
Give a bad boy enough rope and he'll soon make a jackass of himself.
Pinocchio!
Pinocchio?
Where is everybody?
The place is like a graveyard.
I don't like the looks of this.
Pinocchio!
Hey, where are you?
Where d'you suppose all the kids went to, Lampwick?
Ah, they're around here somewheres. What do you care?
- You're having a good time, ain't ya?
- Uh-huh, I sure am.
Oh, boy! This is the life, huh, Pinoky?
Yeah!
It sure is!
Ah, you smoke like me grandmother!
Come on, take a big drag like this.
Okay, Lampy.
Some fun, huh, kid?
Okay, Slats, your shot.
What's the matter, Slats?
Losin' your grip?
Pinocchio! So this is where I find you.
How do you ever expect to be a real boy?
Look at yourself. Smoking...
...playing pool! Ow! You are coming right home with me this minute!
Hey! Who's the beetle?
Let go! Put me down!
Let me out of here. Let me out!
He's my conscience. He tells me what's right and wrong.
What? You mean to tell me you take orders from a grasshopper?
Grasshopper? Look here, you, you impudent young pup!
It wouldn't hurt you to take orders from your grasshopp...
...your conscience, if you have one.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.
Screwball in the corner pocket.
Why... Why... Ya young hoodlum!
I'll... I'll knock your block off!
Why, I'll take you apart and put you back together.
Oh, don't hurt him, Jiminy.
He's my best friend.
Why, I'll... Your best friend?
And what am I?
Just your conscience.
Okay, that settles it.
- But, Jiminy...
- You buttered your bread, now sleep in it.
Ha-ha-ha!
Go on, laugh.
Make a jackass out of yourself.
I'm through! This is the end.
But, Jiminy, Lampwick says a guy only lives once.
Lampwick. Hmph!
Come on, come on.
Let him go.
Lampwick. Hmph, Lampwick!
Burns me up. After all
I tried to do for him.
Who's his conscience anyway?
Me or that, that hoodlum Lampwick?
I've had enough of this.
I'm taking the next boat out of here.
Open up that door!
Open up!
I wanna go home!
Come on, you blokes!
Keep 'em moving!
Lively there now.
We haven't got all night.
Where'd all the donkeys come from?
Come on, come on.
Let's have another.
And what's your name?
Okay, you'll do!
In you go!
You boys'll bring a nice price.
All right, next!
- And what might your name be?
- Alexander.
Hmm, so you can talk.
Ye-Yes, sir. I wanna go home to my mama!
Take him back!
He can still talk!
Please, please!
I don't wanna be a donkey!
- Let me outta here!
- Quiet!
You boys have had your fun.
Now pay for it.
"Boys"? So that's what...
Pinocchio!
Ha! To hear that beetle talk...
...you'd think somethin' was going to happen to us.
Conscience. Nah, phooey!
Where does he get that stuff?
"How do you ever expect to be a real boy?"
What's he think
I look like, a jackass?
You sure do!
Hey, you laugh like a donkey.
Did that come out of me?
Oh!
Huh?
What the...
What's goin' on?
I've been double-crossed!
Help! Help!
Somebody, help!
I've been framed! Help!
Please, you gotta help me.
Oh, be a pal.
Call that beetle!
Call anybody!
Mama! Mama!
- Oh, what's happened?
- I hope I'm not too late.
What'll I do?
- Pinocchio!
- Jiminy! Oh, Jiminy, help!
Wait, Pinoke! The kids, the boys, they're all donkeys!
Oh, you too!
Come on, quick!
Before you get any worse.
This way, Pinoke.
It's the only way out.
Hurry up... before they see us.
You gotta jump!
Jiminy.
Jiminy, y-you all right?
Sure. I thought we'd never make it.
Certainly feels good to be back on...
...dry land.
Come on, let's get home.
Father! Father, I'm home!
- We're home, Mr Geppetto! Home again!
- It's me, Pinocchio!
- I'm home to stay!
- Here he is, Mr Geppetto. Home at last.
Hey, maybe he's asleep.
Father! Father, it's me!
Pinoke, come here.
Look. He ain't here.
He... He's gone.
Yeah, and Figaro.
And Cleo too.
Maybe something awful happened to him.
Don't worry, son, he probably hasn't gone far.
Hey.
- It's a message.
- What's it say?
- It's about your father.
- Where is he?
Why, uh, uh, it says here he, uh...
...he went looking for you and, uh, uh, he was swallowed by a whale.
- Swallowed by a whale?
- Yeah, uh-huh. A... A whale?
- A whale named Monstro.
- Oh, he's...
But, but wait.
He's alive.
- Alive? Where?
- Why, uh, uh...
...inside the whale at the, at the bottom of the sea.
- Bottom of the sea?
- Uh-huh. Uh... Hey! Where you going?
I'm going to find him.
But, Pinoke, are you crazy?
Don't you realize, uh, he's in a whale?
I've gotta go to him.
Hey, Pinoke, wait!
Listen here, son.
But this Monstro,
I've heard of him.
He's a whale of a whale.
Why, he swallows whole ships alive.
Tie it good and tight now.
And besides, it's dangerous.
- Why, I...
- Bye, Jiminy.
Goodbye? I may be live bait down there, but I'm with ya.
Come on, let's go.
Look out below!
Gangway, down there.
Gee, what a big place.
- Come on, Jiminy.
- All right.
Soon as I take on some ballast.
One side, sister.
Well, so long.
Hmm, put it in the wrong end.
Hmph, no more privacy than a goldfish.
Ooh, chilly.
Father!
Father!
Hey, Pinoke, wait for me!
Father!
Father! Huh, he ain't my father.
Mr Geppetto!
Hey, what the...
Hey, le... let go!
Run along, ya little... squirt.
What's the matter? Can't a fellow, uh... I was only...
We were only looking for Monstro.
That got 'em.
Father!
Father!
Oh, hello.
Oh! Uh...
...can you tell me where we can find Monstro?
Gee, they're scared.
Uh, pardon me, pearl...
...are you acquainted with Monstro the whale?
Whoa, hold it there.
Father!
One side there, son.
Come on, boys, break it up.
Break it up now.
Hey, what the...
Whoa, quit, quit, quit shoving now.
Quit, whoa. Don't crowd.
Now take it easy. Take it easy there.
Whoa-ho-ho there. Whoa!
Steady there, Nellie.
Go ahead, Pinoke, ask them.
Could any of you tell me where to find Monstro?
Whoa! Whoa, boy!
Whoa, whoa! Hey!
Uh, sakes alive.
Father!
- Father!
- Mr Geppetto!
Not a bite for days.
We can't hold out much longer.
I never thought...
...it would end this way, Figaro.
Starving to death...
...in the belly of a whale.
My poor little Pinocchio.
He was such a good boy.
It's hopeless, Figaro.
There isn't a fish left.
If the monster doesn't wake up soon, I...
I'm afraid we...
We are done for.
Here they come!
Tuna! Oh, tuna fish!
Food! We'll eat!
Here's a big one!
Keep them in there, Figaro!
Hey! Wait a minute!
Ha-Have you seen...
Monstro!
We got to get out of here!
Come on, Pinoke.
Don't wait for me.
Never saw so many!
Here's another one!
Enough for weeks!
Here's a big one.
Keep them in there, Figaro!
Hey, blubber mouth, open up!
I got to get in there!
Looks like the last of them.
Here's a big one.
Only a few left.
We got to work fast!
- Hey!
- Here's another one.
Hey, Father!
- Father!
- Don't bother me now, Pinocchio!
- Pinocchio!
- Father!
Pinocchio, my son!
- Hey, Father, here I am!
- Huh?
Oh, oh, yes!
Pinocchio, my boy!
- I... I'm so happy to see you!
- Me too, Father!
- Oops!
- Figaro! Ah, Figaro.
Cleo! Oh, Cleo!
- You're here too.
- Yes!
We are all together again!
- Oh, you, you are soaking wet.
- Yes, Father.
You, you mustn't catch cold.
- But I came to save you!
- You shouldn't have come down here.
- But, Father!
- But I'm awfully glad to see you.
Let me take your hat. Oh!
Pinocchio!
What's the matter?
- Those ears!
- Huh? Ears?
Oh, these.
Hah. Oh, that's nothing.
I got a tail too.
Pinocchio!
What's happened to you?
Well, I... I... I...
Oh, never mind now.
Old Geppetto has his little Woodenhead.
Nothing else matters.
I got to get in!
My pal's in there!
Come on, you big moose!
Open up, I tell ya...
Hey! Cut it out!
Oh, boy.
Beat it, you buzzards!
Get out? Oh, no, no, son.
I've tried every way.
Why, I, I even built a raft.
- A raft? That's it!
- Huh?
We'll take the raft, and when the whale opens its mouth...
No, no, no, no.
N-Now listen, son.
He only opens his mouth when he's eating.
Then everything comes in.
Nothing goes out.
- Oh.
- It's hopeless, Pinocchio.
Come. We make a nice fire and we cook some of the fish.
- A fire! That's it!
- Yes. And then we'll all eat again.
A great big fire!
Lots of smoke.
Smoke? Oh, yeah, sure.
A smoked fish will taste good.
- Quick, some wood.
- Pinocchio, not the chair!
Hurry, Father. More wood!
Oh, what will we sit on if we...
We won't need it.
We're getting out!
Getting out?
But how?
- We'll make him sneeze!
- Make him sneeze?
Ohh, that will make him mad.
Well, it's about time!
- It won't work!
- Hurry, Father! Climb aboard!
- We'll never get by those teeth!
- Yes, we will!
Hey, which way you going?
Wait for me!
Hang on! Here we go!
Gesundheit.
- We're going back!
- No, we'll make it! Faster, faster!
It's no use!
We're done for!
We made it!
Look! Now he is mad!
I told you he'd be furious!
- He's gone!
- Where did he go?
Look out!
Hang on!
He's coming back.
Hurry!
He's trying to kill us!
Paddle, son!
Let's go back!
Look out! Jump!
Father! Father!
Oh, Father!
Pinocchio, swim for shore.
Swim for shore.
Hang on, Father!
Save... yourself.
Pinocchio...
...save yourself.
Don't mind me, son.
Save yourself, Pinocchio.
Pinocchio?
Oh, Pinocchio!
Pinocchi...
My boy.
My brave little boy.
Prove yourself brave, truthful and unselfish...
...and someday you will be a real boy.
Awake, Pinocchio.
Awake.
Father!
Whatcha crying for?
'Cause... you are dead,
Pinocchio.
No! No, I'm not.
Yes, yes, you are.
Now, lie down.
But, Father, I'm alive. See?
And... And I'm, uh...
I'm... I'm real.
I'm a real boy!
You're alive!
And, and you are a real boy!
- Yea! Whoopie!
- A real live boy!
This calls for a celebration!
Professor, lots of music!
Well! Huh. Th-This is practically where I came in.
Thank you, milady.
He deserved to be a real boy.
And it sure was nice of you to...
Huh? Wha... Uh... Wh... Wh...
Well, I'll be!
My, my!
Solid gold too.
Oh, I think it's swell!

Hmm! Now what have I done?
I guess I don't know my own strength.
Sorry to upset you, miss.
Have you on your feet in a jiffy.
- Upsy-daisy.
- Mama!
Your mama isn't here, honey.
But if I can be of service, the name is Cricket.
Uh, J. Cricket. You can call me Jiminy.
Oops! Sorry! Ha-ha.
Oh. Howdy, chum.
Why so glum?
Say, what's the matter? You worried about somethin' too?
Tsk, tsk. Never saw such a dismal pair.
A deadpan doll and a droopy bear.
You ought to try my recipe.
Be full of fun and fancy-free.
Life is a song... happy, gay.
So let's have some music.
Come on! What d'you say?
"Bongo"? Now, what in the world is Bongo?
Oh! "A Musical Story
Sung by Dinah Shore."
Well, what are we waitin' for?
Da, da, doo, da
A ringer!
It's a gift.
Da, da, dee, da, la, doh
La, da
Take it away, Dinah!
This is the story...
- of three bears.
- Yeah, I know.
The mama bear, the papa bear, and the itsy-bitsy baby bear.
But it's not the story you expect.
This is a love story.
It's about a little girl bear... and a big, burly, brawny brown bear... who wanted very much to be her boyfriend.
But mostly, this is a story about Bongo.
He was a circus bear.
He was born in the circus, grew up in the circus.
In fact, Bongo was the star of the circus.
In fact, Bongo was the star of the circus.
Why, he could juggle and dance while on a trapeze, walk a tightrope with the greatest of ease.
In jujitsu, he was beyond compare.
Once threw a bull at the county fair.
Super at wrestling and lifting weights.
Outboxed the champs of 1 7 states.
They all packed in from near and far... to see this death-defying star.
With mouths wide open, they watched his ascent... as he daringly climbed to the top of the tent!
Then, for a grand climax, he would gracefully plunge 300 feet... into a wet sponge!
Poor Bongo.
Naturally, you'd think he'd be handled with kid gloves, treated like a king... and pampered like a baby.
But, no! He was tossed around like an old shoe.
Bongo, the bear in the gilded cage.
His thoughts would wander to an imaginary life... far removed from the circus.
Bongo, Bongo, Bongo
Bongo, Bongo, Bongo
Some half-forgotten instinct kept calling him.
For you see, Bongo was a dreamer.
Hey, Bongo! Get going! You're on!
The call of the wild kept ringing in his ears.
Psst! Hey. Bongo!
He couldn't ignore it any longer.
Bongo, Bongo, Bongo
He had to answer the call of the great open spaces.
Come on out, Bongo.
Bongo, Bongo
Come on out, Bongo.
Come on out, Bongo!
Bongo, Bongo.
He was crackin' up!
Bongo, Bongo!
- He was losin' his grip!
- Bongo, Bongo, Bongo!
He had to escape, to get away!
Just gotta get away!
- Bongo, Bongo!
- Gotta get away! Gotta get away.
- Bongo, Bongo, Bongo!
- Gotta, gotta, gotta!
Bongo! Bongo!
Bongo! Bongo!
Bongo! Bongo! Bongo!
Bongo! Bongo! Bongo!
At last he was free.
Free. Free?
Oh! But this was even better than he'd expected!
"Oh, boy, "thought
Bongo, "this is livin'!"
Whoo!
He felt so good, he just had to run around... and jump.
Why, he even tried to growl.
"Oh, boy! A tree. That's for me!"
Just right for climbin' too.
"Oh, well. What if I can't climb a big old tree?
This is still the place for a fellow like me."
- Ooh, ah, ohh
- Just lazy and loafin'... and fancy-free.
- I love to hang around
- Ooh
The lazy countryside
Where things are nice and breezy
With nature's gang around
The lazy countryside
Where life is twice as easy
Where the crickets
You don't hear in the city
Keep a-hummin' in your ear
Oh, so pretty
And it's just too much for words
Listenin' to the chorus of the birds
I like to stay around
The lazy countryside
And while away the hours
Just kind of play around
The lazy countryside
As free as bees and flowers
There's more fun in takin' the sun in
And to roam the spaces wide
It's the place for me
Gee, but it's great to be
'Round the lazy countryside
There's more fun in takin' the sun in
And to roam the spaces wide
It's the place for me
Gee, but it's great to be
'Round the lazy
Countryside
"Oh, boy," thought Bongo,
"this is the stuff."
"To stretch out under a canopy of stars...
"studding the velvet softness of the night.
To sleep in the peace and quiet of the woods."
The stillness of the night descends like a sheltering veil.
Hush. All nature sleeps.
Then came the dawn.
Ohh. Bongo felt as stiff as a board... and as cranky as an old bear.
Bongo was discouraged.
A fine kind of bear he'd turned out to be!
He didn't even know how to act like a bear.
This rough, rugged stuff wasn't for him.
Especially on an empty stomach.
Uh-uh.
Bongo thought, "This is just too good to be true!
"I... I'm either hungry or I'm still dreamin'.
"Ow! I'm awake! It must be true.
Oh, this is much better than dreamin'!"
"This must be heaven.
I-it can't be real!
"It's just too good to be true.
But let me go right on dreamin', as long as I'm with you."
This is too good
To be true
I can't believe it's real
Can it be you
I really see
I never knew
I'd find an angel
And out of the blue
You came to me
You're all the heavenly things
That I've been dreaming of
Don't spread your wings
And fly away
But if you're only
Passing through
Then take me to heaven with you
Or is this a dream
Too good to be
True
This is too good to be true
I can't believe it's real
Can it be you
I really see
I never knew I'd find an angel
Out of the blue you came to me
You're all the heavenly things
That I've been dreaming of
Don't spread your wings
Don't fly away
But if you're only
Passing through
Then take me to heaven with you
Or is this a dream
Too good to be
True
The air grew still with a sudden chill.
No talk, no laughs, no chatter.
With the trees shaking, the ground quaking, the crowd began to scatter.
Out of his lair came the third bear, with murder in his eye.
He took in the scene of love serene with jealousy and surprise.
He was the roughest, toughest, meanest bear.
Lump jaw by name, a villain for fair.
Well... what's this?
It's no dream. It's a nightmare!
"He-He-Hello," was all Bongo could say.
"Hmm. Kind of unfriendly.
Probably doesn't know who I am."
"Just a moment. This is my affair."
"He-He-Hello, Lulubelle, dear."
Gosh, Bongo was surprised.
Why should Lulubelle turn against him?
That was no way for a lady to act.
Lulubelle's feelings were hurt.
All right.
She'd give Mr. Bongo just one more chance.
"What have I done?"
Poor Bongo.
It was too good
- To be true
- Ah
Gone were his dreams.
His world was shattered.
Why hadn't someone ever told him about all of these things... that really mattered?
- And now,
- Ah well, now it was just too late.
He'd never find out that when bears are in love, they always say it with a slap.
When a bird loves a bird he can twitter
When a puppy falls in love he can yap
Every pigeon likes to coo when he says I love you
But a bear likes to say it with a slap
When a whippoorwill's in love he can whipper
All the horses neck and all the turtles snap
Every deer and every dove has a way of makin' love
But a bear likes to say it with a slap
You can ask any bear, Oh
There's nothin' to compare
With a love tap
Strong or weak
So if you're ready for romance and you ever get the chance
- Grab your girl
- Give her your cheek
- So when love comes along Don't be silly
- Doo, doo, doo, doo
- Never ever waste your time like a sap
- Doo, doo, doo, doo
Let the others hug and kiss but the bare facts are this
That a bear likes to say it with a slap
- Slap, slap
- Give me a love tap
Grab your bears and swing 'em wide
Shake their fur and scratch their hide
Give her a slap
Give her a cuff
Go 'round that floor and strut your stuff
He slapped her once and he missed her jaw and he wound up smackin' his mother-in-law
Now here comes Grandpa gettin' in line, And here comes baby bear behind
- Whoo-hoo!
- Oh, oh, oh, oh
When a bird loves a bird he can twitter
When a puppy falls in love he can yap
Every pigeon likes to coo when he says I love you
But a bear likes to say it with a slap
When a whippoorwill's in love he can whipper
All of the horses neck and all the turtles snap
Every deer and every dove has a way of makin' love
But a bear likes to say it with a slap
You can ask any bear
Oh, there's nothing to compare with a love tap strong or weak
If you're ready for romance
And you ever get the chance
Grab your girl give her your cheek
So when love comes along don't be silly
Never ever waste your time like a sap
Let the others hug and kiss but the bare facts are this
That a bear likes to say it with a slap
Slap, slap
So when love comes along don't be silly
Never ever waste your time like a sap
Let the others hug and kiss
But the bare facts are this
That a bear likes to say it with a slap
"I love you, Lulubelle."
"I love you too, Bongo."
You're all the heavenly things
That I've been dreaming of
Ohh don't spread your wings
And fly away
But if you're only
Passing through
Then take me to heaven with you
Ooh
Or is this a dream
Too good to be
- True
- Is it only a dream
Too good to be true
Excuse me. There.
Now who says dreams don't come true? Well!
Three is a crowd, they say.
So I'll drop back another day.
" Miss Luana Patten."
Mmm! Well.
Of course, it's not cricket to read other folks' mail, but...
"A party!
Tonight!" Mmm.
"The house across the way.
"Charlie McCarthy. Mortimer Snerd!
Edgar Bergen?" Huh.
Never heard of him.
"Please come!"
Why, I'd be delighted!
Join the party
Come along
It's a cinch
Can't go wrong
Now's the time to see what you can see
The house is just across the way
Better hurry
Don't delay
You'll be full of fun and fancy-free
Oh, dear. Nanny goats and petticoats.
- I'm a caution.
- Yes, you certainly are.
Tell me, what is the secret of your lovely complexion?
- Well, I... I use saddle soap.
- I see.
Yes. If I'm not being too personal, Ophelia...
- Yeah?
- Uh, how old are you?
- Oh, I'm, uh, a girl my age.
- A girl your age?
- Yes.
- And how old is that?
- Uh, 28.
- Twenty-eight.
I thought you were a little bit older than that.
Well, I knocked off a few years for good behavior.
I don't care for that.
It's kid stuff. Ha-ha.
Well, we're awfully glad you came to our party.
- Well.
- Did you have fun?
Oh, yes, indeedy. I thought Charlie made a pig of himself with that chocolate cake.
- Oh, you're quite right.
- Yes, I am. Yes.
Yes, I agree with you.
- Well, good night, Luana.
- Good night, Ophelia.
- Bonne nuit, Mortimer.
- Uh... ma'am?
- Bonne nuit.
- Oh, yes, ma'am. Yeah, yeah. Bunny...
Uh, bunny, bunny wee, bunny wee. Bun...
Uh... uh, I don't know no bunny wee.
- Good night, Charlie.
- Uh, good night.
- You know, Ophelia, you look so sweet.
- Ah, what'd you say?
- I say, I think you look so sweet.
- Yes?
- I'm going to kiss you good night.
- Oh, help, help, help!
Help, he...
Isn't that a wonderful trick?
Yes, it is. Yes. I wish I could enjoy my first childhood... as much as he does his second.
Now, Luana, how would you like another piece of cake or some ice cream?
- No, thank you. I'm full up.
- Some candy?
- Care for a cigar?
- Me?
How about you, Mortimer?
- Mortimer?
- Uh... I don't smoke.
I don't mean that. Well, what shall we do now? Any suggestions?
How would you like to go down to the city dump and watch me slug rats?
- Certainly not.
- No?
How would you like to hear me tell a story?
Oh, I'd love it.
Wouldn't you, Charlie?
Well, I, uh... y-y-yeah... no.
This is a story that everyone should know.
Yes, but not everyone should tell it. And you know who.
Well, I'm going to tell it anyway.
Now, many, many years ago...
I think I'll run out and wind a sundial.
- You'll stay right here.
- Yes, sir.
Once upon a time, long, long ago...
Funny, nothing ever happens nowadays.
There was a place called Happy Valley.
Now, it was called Happy Valley... because everyone who lived there was happy.
- No! Well, there's a hunk of logic for you.
- Are you listening, Mortimer?
- Uh, Happy Valley?
- That's right, yes.
Now just try and imagine it. Can't you just close your eyes and see it?
Well, I can't see very good with my eyes closed.
My eyelids get in the way.
- You create a picture in your mind's eye.
- Oh.
That's not easy for him.
His mind gets in the way.
- Now try and paint a mental picture.
- Yeah.
I... I painted a barn once, I did.
- Well, that's very interesting.
- Yeah.
- It was... It was a red barn. It was. Yeah.
- Well, forget the barn.
- Yeah.
- And try and picture Happy Valley.
- Well, I'll... I'll work on it.
- That's the spirit.
Yeah. Yeah. I'll work on it.
Let's see, uh... Let's see, now.
It's, uh... Oh, let's say it's about, uh...
Uh, what was the question?
- Happy Valley.
- Oh, yeah! Yeah. That's right. Yeah.
- Let's see, uh...
- Think hard!
Yeah.
Let's see, uh...
Oh, I'm tired. All that work for nothin'.
- Can I try?
- Certainly.
Yes. I think I can see it, Mr. Bergen.
It's beautiful.
Yes, it was one of nature's garden spots, nestled among the green, rolling hills.
Can't you see the lovely brook as it flows through the valley?
Mmm. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
The winding roads, lined with stately trees.
Trees. Yeah.
Lush fields and prosperous farms dot the landscape.
L-Landscape. Yeah.
And high on a hilltop overlooking the valley,
- shining like a jewel, stands...
- My red barn.
No, no. It was something much nicer.
- It was a majestic castle!
- Oh, that's pretty.
And something very precious is kept within these castle walls.
- My
- What is it?
It's a magic, singing harp. Listen.
What a happy day
What a sunny sky, kind of makes you sigh in a happy way
What a very merry day
All the world is gay
When your cares are light and your heart takes flight
And you're swept away
The air is sweet with clover
The clouds are turning over
Oh, yes
They're turning over
Just to show their silver lining
My, what a happy day
Never knew such bliss
Never read of this
In a book or play
What a lovely day
What a great big gorgeous, sumptuous thumping, bumptious
Hum-galumptious simply scrumptious
My, what a happy day
M-M-My, what a happy day
Never knew such bliss
Never read of this in a book or play
What a lovely day
What a great big gorgeous, sumptuous thumping, bumptious
Hum-galumptious simply scrumptious
Oh, my, oh, my
What a happy
Day
Yes, the voice of this golden harp... cast a magic spell of joy and prosperity over the valley.
- But it was too good to last...
- I knew there was a catch in it.
- for one day...
- They built a schoolhouse.
No, no. One day a mysterious shadow crept over the valley.
And then something dreadful happened!
Aaaaaah!
What happened?
When the shadow lifted, the golden harp was gone.
No longer was the valley happy, for without the magic of the harp, all was misery, misery, misery.
Just like the eighth grade.
Desolation spread over the land.
Everything was drying up.
- Dry rot.
- Yes, isn't it?
- Charlie.
- Yes, sir.
The fields of golden corn turned to dust.
Kerplop.
The laughing brook flowed no more.
To think that this was once Happy Valley!
Now it's Gruesome Gulch.
Days pass, weeks pass.
I pass. New deal.
What happened to all the people?
Well, suppose we look in on these humble peasants.
- Is that a peasant?
- That's a cow, stupid.
Well, at least they had milk.
Well, she used to be a good milker. But now...
She's an udder failure.
She was the bosom friend of a once-proud family.
Well, they're certainly out of the high rent district.
And there they are, three poor farmers, gripped by the pangs of starvation.
Still alive, still breathing, sharing a pitiful crust between them.
Share and share alike.
Sharing and staring.
Staring and sharing.
Uh, just tell it, don't ham it.
But are their spirits broken?
Have they lost hope?
Yes. Men facing famine, naught left but beans.
Ahem. Bean, you mean.
If it were one man and three beans...
But, no. One bean and three men.
Well, at least there are no bones in it.
Just look at that miserable creature, doggedly struggling to maintain life, a gaunt, lean bag of bones and feathers.
Truly a picture of despair.
But Donald doesn't whimper.
- Donald doesn't give up.
- Shut up!
I can't stand it!
Easy, Donald. Easy!
There. There, now.
There. Easy, Donald.
I... I'll be all right.
Yeah. I'll be all right.
I'll be all right.
He says he's all right, but I wonder.
He's suffered too much.
What diabolical thought is being hatched in the fevered brain... of this poor, demented duck?
Donald! No! No!
Nice bossy, bossy.
- Nice old cowsy wowsy.
- Donald!
Donald! No, Donald!
Give it here! Let me...
I just gotta eat.
I'm so... hungry.
The little fellow was completely out of his head.
- Cut it out, will ya? I get the idea!
- He was a pitiful sight.
- Weeks without food. Poor Donald.
- Yeah, poor me!
It was all they could do to restrain him.
You see, he had just about reached...
- the end of his rope.
- Yeah.
Oh, it was a sorry predicament indeed.
What to do? What to do?
Well, Donald may be nuts, but he's got the right idea. Kill the cow.
Oh, no, Charlie! The cow was their best friend.
Well, a friend in need is a friend indeed.
- So what?
- So, they need some steak.
No! If you're gonna kill the cow,
I don't wanna hear the rest of the story.
Well, she wouldn't have to know.
They could sneak up on her and surprise her. Yeah, that's what we'll do.
- We'll kill the cow.
- Oh, no, Charlie. You mustn't.
We'll get a stranglehold on her while she's asleep.
- a-a-and then push her off the cliff.
- Oh, no!
I ain't a-gonna listen to the story.
Well, it'll be your fault if they starve to death.
- Why don't they sell the cow?
- That's just what they did.
Well, why didn't you say so in the first place, and save a lot of time?
I could save a lot of time by not telling the story at all!
Your idea is not without merit.
Well, back to the scene of desolation.
Things are beginning to look much brighter now, because as Mickey goes to the village to sell the cow, the thought of prosperity... brings new hope to the famished farmers.
Even Donald has fully recovered, for soon their long-empty plates... will overflow with food.
Hey, look! Turkey, lobster sweet potato pie
Pancakes piled up 'til they reach the sky
Wa-wa, wa-wa, wa-wa, wa-wa
Wa-wa, wa-wa, wa-wa, wa-wa
Oh-h-h-h
I wanna eat and eat and eat and eat
And eat until I die
Turkey, lobster sweet potato pie
Pancakes piled up 'til they reach the sky
Lots of starches
Lots of greens
Fancy chocolate-covered...
- Beans!
- What d'you mean, beans?
Yeah, fellows. I sold the cow for some magic beans!
Beans!
But Donald!
These are not ordinary beans!
They're magic beans!
If you plant these beans in the light of a full moon, do you know what'll happen?
Yes! We get more beans!
- No, no, Donald!
- Magic beans! Phooey!
Poor Mickey, cheated into trading his cow for a handful of beans.
Tsk, tsk, tsk. What a mean trick!
Swindling an innocent farmer out of all he owned... and lying to him, telling him that the beans were magic.
Planted in the light of a full moon!
What a shame to deceive a simple little peasant.
Magic beans, indeed!
- Light of a full moon.
- Bergen? Oh, Bergen!
- What?
- There's something moving.
Why, yes. Well, maybe there is some magic in them!
All right, now let's all keep quiet and see what happens.
Mmm.
And all through the night, it grew, onward and upward.
That thing is a menace to aviation.
And so, with the coming of dawn, we find the bewildered farmers staring at a mammoth castle, miles above the earth.
Their curiosity was aroused, nothing could hold them back.
Who lives there? Man or monster?
Friend or foe?
A princess or a dragon?
Well, search me.
What drew them toward this place of mystery?
Hunger? Desperation?
Or perhaps it was love of adventure.
What a fantastic experience, perhaps mortal man... has never before set foot on this strange land.
- Well, somebody did.
- Oh, gosh! Who made them?
Well, it wasn't Cinderella.
Soon they reached the moat surrounding the castle.
But this didn't stop them. On they went, as if drawn by some irresistible force.
And then, suddenly, without warning, out of the sky above...
Ooh, dragonflies!
Yeah. A-flyin' front and draggin' behind.
- Gee, what whoppers!
- Yeah. Bombers!
Come back and fight!
Finally, they reached the castle.
The hard way.
This was the biggest adventure of their lives.
Forgotten was their hunger, forgotten was their fear.
It took courage to scale these massive steps, to make this journey into the unknown.
But these stouthearted lads never faltered.
Three minds with but a single thought.:
What mystery lurked within those cold, forbidding walls?
What strange spell hovered over this gloomy place?
Will no one answer?
Are they walking into a trap?
Do they go in?
You know, you could stand some rehearsal on this story.
Inside, the tremendous hall was as silent as a tomb.
Not a sign of life anywhere.
Caught with his pants...
- Charlie!
- Caught with his pants...
- Charlie!
- Well, his slip was showing.
They gazed in speechless wonder, almost afraid to breathe.
Suddenly they looked up.
What was it?
Food! Yum, yum, yum, yum!
Let me at it!
Oh! Who's there? Who is it?
- That's the harp!
- Boy, oh, boy!
How'd you get here?
I was kidnapped by that wicked giant!
- Oh. A... A giant!
- A giant!
- A giant?
- A giant!
- Bigger than 40 men.
- Oh, no!
An ogre who had the power to turn himself into anything, man or beast.
That calls for a drink.
It was this heartless monster that swooped down under cover of darkness, carried off the golden harp and...
- brought ruin to Happy Valley.
- No!
Ohh!
Ohh!
- I'm a giant.
- You are not.
- You're nothing of the kind.
- Well, I'm a small giant.
- No, you're not.
- I'm, uh... I'm tougher than 40 men.
- You're not.
- Well... uh, 20 men.
- No.
- No? Ten men?
Aren't you ashamed of yourself,
Charlie? Why do you act like that?
I don't know. I guess it's just a stage I'm goin' through.
- Well, take off that moustache.
- Yeow!
Now go over there and behave yourself.
Yes, sir. Everything I do is wrong.
But why did the giant want to steal the harp?
Because he was cruel and selfish. He didn't care what happened to the valley.
He just wanted someone to sing him to sleep.
Well, why didn't he turn on the radio?
Well, they didn't have radios in those days.
Yeah. That's why they called it Happy Valley.
- What did the giant look like?
- Well, he was...
Oh... I'll try and show you.
He looked something like this.
Ha. Looks like my pig Smedley.
Never mind the self-portraits. Ha-ha.
Well, no, that isn't right.
He... He looked more like... more like this.
There he is now. And the giant came home for dinner, roaring...
- Drunk.
- I was not!
- I mean, he was not.
- No.
Down the castle hall he came, roaring...
Fe, fi, fo, fum!
Fe, fi, fo, fum!
Fe, fi, fo, fum
He, hi, ho, hum
I'm a most amazing guy
A most amazing guy am I
Fe, fi, fo, fum
He, hi, ho, hum
I'm the stuff, I'm tellin' you for here's what I can do
I can change myself into an elf
Fly up high like the birdies
I can disappear into atmosphere
Peekaboo. 'Cause I know the magic wordies
Fi, fo, fe, foy
Fe, fe, fe, fe
Fifi? I don't know no Fifi.
Those are his magic words, you know.
Fe, fi, fo, fum.
- I smell...
- You're telling us!
Wait. He may be smarter than he looks.
Oh, I hope he doesn't find them.
Hey, Giant, you're getting warm.
Well, don't tell him!
- Behind the jar, stupid.
- Charlie!
Pot roast! Chocolate pot roast!
With stispacio...
With dismashmee...
With dismash...
With green gravy.
Feedy, fidey, fodey, fum!
Gesundheit.
Oh, no, you don't! You can't get away from Willie.
I gotcha!
I think I gotcha.
Yeah, I gotcha.
Willie.
What?
He'll have to talk fast to get out of this one.
Well, you leave it to Mickey. Just watch.
Ten, twenty, thirty, forty.
Boy, what a life line!
But what's this here?
What is it? What is it!
Uh-oh! I can't believe it!
- Is it bad?
- Why, i-it says here... that you can change yourself into anything!
Sure, sure! You wanna see me?
I can change myself into the darndest things!
Go on, gimme somethin'.
- Anything!
- Anything?
Anything.
See? Mickey never misses a trick.
- He's got a good idea.
- Well, uh...
Can you change into a fly?
A cute, teeny-weeny, itsy-bitsy housefly?
That's it. A housefly.
Aw, you don't want a fly.
How about a bunny with long, pink ears?
Ha. Well, of course, if you can't do a fly, why, uh...
All right. A fly.
- Why?
- Well, they're, uh...
- Because.
- Okay.
A teeny-weeny fly.
With pink wings.
Now for the magic wordies.
Fe, fi, fo, fum
He, hi, ho, hum
I'm a most amazing guy
Te, ti, te, ti, te, ti
You sure you don't want a pink bunny?
Hey, what is this?
You think you fool Willie.
Yeah, a couple more good ideas like that and they're finished.
Well, I'll admit the little fellows are in a bad fix.
But Mickey isn't one to give up without a struggle.
And with a little luck, they may still pull through.
This isn't the first time
Mickey's been in a tight spot.
Anybody wanna buy a tall, thin mouse?
No, thank you. Uh, I mean no.
Yes, things look pretty dark for the prisoners.
Looks like their goose is cooked.
Oh, Fate may yet deal them a winning hand.
Don't forget, there's still the magic harp. She knows the giant's weakness.
She could be my weakness.
There might still be a chance of escape... if she could only use her magic voice to put the giant to sleep.
If she can't, I know who can.
Shh. Let's all be quiet now, and see.
In my favorite dream
Everyone is so delightful
No one's mean or spiteful
In my favorite dream
Yes, and in my favorite dream
There my heart can go romancing
Dancing to a heavenly theme
But there's something else
I look forward to
It's a secret
But here's a clue
He's my favorite
You know who
You're the hero of
My most favorite
Dream
Oh, mercy. Forgive us.
In his right vest pocket
You'll find the key
The right vest pocket
Go carefully
Oh!
Ah... Ah... Ah...
I'll smash... Ah... I'll smash...
Ah... Ah... Ah...
Ah... Ah... Ah... Ah...
Ah... Ah... Ah...
Where is he?
Hello?
Nightmare.
Oh, boy.
- He made it!
- He did?
- Here he comes with the key!
- Let me have it, Mickey!
Well, it looks like success at last.
Free from the clutches of that terrible monster.
And now to find the beanstalk, climb down and return home in triumph, with a big surprise for Happy Valley.
But wait. Mickey's going to make doubly sure.
He's taking no chances.
Just in case the giant might wake up.
Oh!
Ha. Should have left well enough alone.
Come back here! Come back here!
And there goes the giant!
He's helpless now, tumbling over and over and over, down, down, down, down.
And so with the passing of the wicked giant,
Happy Valley echoed once again with song and laughter.
For with the return of the magic harp, peace and prosperity reigned throughout the land.
- And the people of the valley...
- We know.
Lived happily ever after.
You're a wonderful storyteller,
Mr. Bergen. Isn't he, Charlie?
Simply thrilling.
You're even better than the old-fashioned sleeping pill.
What's the matter, Mortimer?
Oh, the poor giant got killed, that he did.
- I don't like them sad endings.
- Oh, now, you don't understand.
W-Willie was a nice giant, he was.
He just got too big for his britches.
- But you don't understand.
- No, don't touch me.
I'll be all right.
Oh, excuse me.
What I'm trying to explain,
Mortimer, is that Willie the Giant...
- didn't actually exist.
- No?
No. He's a metaphysical phenomenon of your subconscious mind, a phantasmagoria of your mental faculties.
Yeah?
In other words, just a figment of your imagination.
- No!
- Yes.
So there's nothing to be upset about.
Hey! Has anybody seen anything... of a teensy-weensy little mouse?
No. I-I-I, uh...
Oh, Mr. Bergen!
Bergen, speak to me. Speak to me.
What's the matter with him?
Somethin' he ate?
Uh, no. It's, uh...
It's a fig, uh, fig... fig-a-mentation of his imagination.
- No!
- Yeah.
Well, uh, good night, Willie.
Uh, don't slam the roof.
You might wake Mr. Bergen.
Now some folks don't believe in giants
Castles up above
And others say that bears don't talk
And never fall in love
If you really wanna find
Happiness
Peace of mind
Believe in all your dreams
And you will see
You'll be full of fun and fancy
Free and full of fun
And fancy-free
{408}{457}A warm handshake ortwo
{480}{525}Goodfriends always
{636}{687}A new's waiting to start
{720}{784}You must meet it|Wake up andgreet it
{792}{845}With a gaysong inyourheart
{1701}{1752}Here's an unusual expedition:
{1752}{1858}artists' musicians and writers setting|out for a trip through Latin America...
{1860}{1956}to find new personalities' music|and dances for their cartoon films.
{2343}{2427}Three days later they glided in|to Rio deJaneiro' Brazil...
{2427}{2498}then down to the Argentine'|Buenos Aires...
{2661}{2714}and out across the pampas.
{2829}{2886}At Cordoba' the party divided.
{2961}{3021}Some flew over the Andes into Chile.
{3021}{3069}The others went north|to the Inca country--
{3069}{3131}Bolivia' Peru|and Lake Titicaca...
{3162}{3222}turning away from the modern cities|to find the descendants...
{3222}{3278}of ancient Inca civilization.
{3366}{3463}Eight thousand square miles ofwater|over two miles above sea level...
{3474}{3580}Lake Titicaca has been prominent in Inca|history and folklore for generations.
{3720}{3780}Wood is scarce at this altitude...
{3780}{3858}so the fishermen's boats|are woven of balsa reeds.
{3990}{4084}There's always plenty of colour|and excitement here on market day.
{4182}{4266}These folks come from miles around|to trade their goods...
{4266}{4327}and swap some of the local gossip.
{4458}{4552}The styles run to bright-coloured|clothes and conservative hats...
{4578}{4636}and a rumble seat for the baby.
{4638}{4715}Just the kind of material|the artists were after.
{4797}{4859}Their music is strange and exotic--
{4905}{4980}melodies handed down|from their Inca ancestors.
{5181}{5250}And walking haystacks|are right in tempo.
{5340}{5429}These little syncopated burros|bear the heavy burdens here...
{5448}{5544}because the more dignified llama|will carry ust so much and no more.
{5592}{5685}When his quota is exceeded'|that haughty aristocrat of the Andes...
{5685}{5751}calmly sits down|and refuses to budge.
{5841}{5920}Yes' a llama can make you feel|awfully unimportant.
{6294}{6378}All these impressions' together with the|local colour that had been absorbed...
{6378}{6438}resulted in a little travelogue...
{6438}{6486}seeing the land of the Incas|through the eyes...
{6486}{6552}of a celebrated North American tourist.
{6654}{6742}Lake Titicaca is approximately|1 3'000 feet above sea level.
{6750}{6815}- 1 3'000 feet!|- Hmm' approximately.
{6846}{6951}At this great height' many visitors are|subect to altitude fever' or soroche.
{6954}{7035}- Is that so?|- The most common symptom is dizziness.
{7038}{7087}Dizziness? Aw' phooey!
{7329}{7400}Often followed|by palpitation of the heart.
{7425}{7484}The ears have a tendency to pop.
{7509}{7575}And a peculiar|ringing sound is heard.
{7653}{7702}Fascinating' isn't it?
{7749}{7804}The balsa, or basket boat...
{7809}{7893}is constructed entirely|of reeds tightly bound together.
{7905}{7965}It's built to withstand|the fury of the elements.
{7965}{8056}In fact' it seems to be impervious|to practically everything...
{8109}{8167}except the inquisitive tourist.
{8229}{8289}Crossing the lake|is often filled with adventure.
{8289}{8357}A strong wind|may arise very suddenly...
{8433}{8483}and then stop suddenly.
{8817}{8865}For the artist|in search of local colour...
{8865}{8937}the marketplace presents an|excellent picture ofvillage life...
{8937}{9022}as shoppers and merchants|bustle about the public square.
{9225}{9331}The precipitous terrain in this region|offers no problem to these hearty folk.
{9369}{9441}And we find the people here|divided into two classes--
{9441}{9502}those who walk against the wind...
{9513}{9573}and those who walk with the wind.
{9705}{9753}Yes' wherever the visitor|points his camera...
{9753}{9815}he finds a picture fit for framing.
{9840}{9909}The llama' or "yama"'|is an odd-looking individual...
{9909}{9966}with considerable personality.
{9981}{10053}His master' here' exercises|complete control over him...
{10053}{10103}with a home-made flute.
{11376}{11456}is quickly interpreted|by this wide-awake youngster.
{11796}{11901}The visitor never seems to be satisfied|until he tries on the native costume.
{11904}{11963}And our tourist is no exception.
{12615}{12675}The llama is obviously|not a itterbug...
{12675}{12735}but ifyou want to explore|this precipitous country...
{12735}{12808}he'll solve all your|transportation problems.
{13005}{13077}One soon becomes accustomed|to the low' fleecy clouds...
{13077}{13153}that steal like silent ghosts|across one's path.
{13230}{13317}The gentle undulating gait of the llama|adapts itselfvery nicely...
{13317}{13392}to the swaying motion|of the suspension bridge.
{13413}{13458}Suspension bridge?
{13473}{13507}Oh' no!
{13590}{13650}Far below us' we see the village.
{13686}{13727}Whoa! Whoa-oa!
{13827}{13864}The flute.
{14199}{14261}Give me that flute' ya big palooka!
{14514}{14559}Hey! Take it easy!
{14562}{14603}Whoa! Whoa-oa!
{14682}{14714}What?
{15006}{15078}The traveller should be cautioned|against any reckless behaviour...
{15078}{15126}at this high altitude.
{15126}{15179}Overexertion is dangerous.
{15186}{15261}And above all' one should|never lose one's temper.
{15261}{15312}Shut up' ya big windbag!
{15387}{15445}Get off of me!|Go on' beat it!
{15483}{15522}Doggone you.
{15867}{15927}And finally' the pottery market...
{15927}{15990}where the visitor always drops in...
{16023}{16071}seldom failing to accumulate|a large collection...
{16071}{16153}of the native handiwork'|as he bids a fond farewell...
{16164}{16232}to the land of the Incas'|Lake Titicaca.
{16356}{16416}The flight across the Andes|into Chile...
{16416}{16476}over the highest mountains in America.
{16476}{16556}Plenty to see and remember|on this spectacular trip.
{16572}{16620}Since no cameras are allowed here...
{16620}{16701}the boys have to cover this|from memory and sketches.
{16773}{16849}Impressions of Uspallata Pass|from 1 6'000 feet.
{16917}{16989}These sketches and the stories|told of the pioneer mail planes...
{16989}{17070}that first flew this route|started everyone thinking.
{17112}{17183}First a little plane|began to take shape...
{17244}{17302}with a personality all his own.
{17328}{17407}All agreed that he had|good screen possibilities...
{17412}{17484}and before the plane set down|at Santiago...
{17484}{17536}his life story had begun.
{17604}{17692}Once upon a time in a little airport|near Santiago' Chile...
{17709}{17763}there lived three aeroplanes:
{17763}{17841}the papa plane' the mama plane|and the baby plane.
{17886}{17960}The papa plane was a big'|powerful male plane.
{18066}{18137}Mama plane was|a middle-sized female plane.
{18174}{18249}And the baby plane was|a little boy plane named Pedro.
{18249}{18295}Uh' where is Pedro?
{18321}{18381}Oh' there he is. Maybe someday...
{18381}{18453}he'll grow up to be a big plane|like his father...
{18453}{18530}who carries the mail|between Chile and Argentina.
{18609}{18669}Like all fledglings'|Pedro went to ground school...
{18669}{18725}to learn the ABC's of flying.
{18777}{18851}He studied reading'|skywriting and arithmetic.
{18894}{18943}He was taught anatomy.
{18960}{19012}He also studied history--
{19029}{19077}Pedro! And geography.
{19113}{19214}And in geography' he learned the mail|route between Santiago and Mendoza.
{19221}{19289}Over the mighty Andes'|past Aconcagua...
{19317}{19388}highest mountain|in the Western Hemisphere.
{19413}{19509}One day the papa plane was laid up|with a cold in his cylinder head.
{19596}{19651}So he couldn't fly the mail.
{19656}{19716}And the mama plane|couldn't stand the altitude...
{19716}{19776}because she had high oil pressure.
{19776}{19824}So she couldn't fly the mail.
{19824}{19882}But the mail must go through...
{19920}{19954}I hope.
{19968}{20033}Calli Pedro.|ReaforFlit 2 to Mendoza.
{20064}{20140}"Now' remember' Pedro"'|the mama plane said...
{20145}{20232}"stay out of downdraught|and keep your muffler on tight."
{20256}{20304}And don't go near Aconca--
{20304}{20350}Aconca-- Aconcagua!
{20454}{20507}Flit 2 leaving forMendoza.
{20598}{20654}Allclear, Pedro.|Let "ergo.
{20730}{20799}Give "erthegun, boy!|Gun "er! Gun "er!
{20826}{20895}Don"t loseyouringspeed!|Pullup!!Pullup!!
{20922}{20958}Look out!
{21042}{21102}And so' after a masterly takeoff...
{21102}{21150}Pedro started on|his first assignment...
{21150}{21208}to pick up the mail at Mendoza.
{21258}{21350}Each and every trip through|this pass is an adventure in itself.
{21354}{21425}At this altitude'|you never can tell what--
{21426}{21465}Downdraught!
{21498}{21558}Pulled out of that one all right.
{21558}{21616}Handles himseIf like a veteran.
{21654}{21714}His course carried him|over the Pass of Uspallata...
{21714}{21786}where stands the statue|of the Christ of the Andes...
{21786}{21858}marking the boundary|between Chile and Argentina.
{21858}{21926}So far' so good.|Not a cylinder missing.
{21942}{22023}Pedro was flying on top|of the world when suddenly...
{22038}{22117}his first view of that|towering monarch' Aconcagua!
{22170}{22248}So this was the big bully|they'd warned him about.
{22257}{22305}But he didn't scare Pedro' though.
{22305}{22343}No' sirree.
{22482}{22527}Well' the worst is over.
{22527}{22602}And from now on'|it's clear sailing to Mendoza.
{22614}{22662}Come in against the wind' Pedro.
{22662}{22727}There's your mail.|Easy now. Attaboy!
{22770}{22835}He picked up his mail|like a veteran.
{22842}{22909}Uh-oh! Careful!|That cargo is precious.
{22938}{23013}Pedro was homeward-bound|and ahead of schedule.
{23046}{23123}I'll bet his mother and dad|will be proud of him.
{23130}{23183}Just a natural-born flier.
{23226}{23295}Hmm. Maybe I|shouldn't have mentioned it.
{23547}{23583}Look out!
{23595}{23643}Hope he got that out of his system.
{23643}{23704}Now with good luck and a--|Uh-oh.
{23775}{23847}I was afraid of that.|Hey' Pedro' come back!
{23889}{23988}The little fellow had completely|forgotten his responsibilities. Pedro!
{24024}{24076}Then suddenly' Aconcagua!
{24120}{24214}Its rocky' snow-filled crags formed|the face of a leering monster.
{24252}{24312}The oil froze|in little Pedro's cylinders...
{24312}{24372}and his motor knocked with fright.
{24372}{24440}All those warnings|came back to him now:
{24444}{24521}the treacherous crosscurrents'|the sudden storms.
{25449}{25505}Climb above the storm' Pedro!
{25509}{25579}Never mind the mail!|Let it go! Let it go!
{25581}{25646}Forget the mail!|Climb' Pedro! Climb!
{25716}{25752}Look out!
{25821}{25868}Climb' Pedro! Climb!
{25887}{25959}Get above the storm!|I know you can make it!
{26172}{26243}Drop the mail!|You've got to save yourself!
{26268}{26333}More altitude!|25'000's all you need!
{26367}{26401}Up! Up!
{26433}{26517}Gun your motor! Now ust a little more|and you'll be in the clear!
{26517}{26575}Climb' Pedro! Climb!|Good boy!
{26613}{26676}Good boy!|I knew you could make it!
{26688}{26736}You're all right now.
{26736}{26806}Just level off|and head straight for home.
{26844}{26887}He's out of gas.
{26928}{26968}Pedro! Pedro!
{27072}{27109}He's gone.
{27144}{27196}Back at the home field...
{27198}{27269}Pedro's parents|searched the skies in vain.
{27270}{27345}They knew that he couldn't|have held out this long.
{27345}{27405}Their brave little son was gone...
{27405}{27467}another martyr to the mail service.
{27489}{27553}Poor little fella.|His first flight.
{27573}{27637}It's too bad|it had to end this way.
{27681}{27722}What was that?
{27729}{27793}I wonder if it--|No' it couldn't be.
{27816}{27867}Wait! It is! It's Pedro!
{28038}{28102}Pedro! Petey boy!|Are you all right?
{28134}{28194}Well' don't ask me how he did it.
{28218}{28288}It wasn't exactly|a three-point landing...
{28290}{28347}but he did fulfil his mission.
{28362}{28417}He brought the mail through.
{28422}{28485}The mail'|that all-important cargo.
{28548}{28623}"Having wonderful time.|Wish you were--" Mmm.
{28647}{28695}Well' it might have been important.
{28695}{28751}And he did bring in the mail.
{28791}{28839}And so' the papa plane'|the mama plane...
{28839}{28908}and little Pedro|flew happily ever after.
{28956}{29045}Sailing eastward from Chile'|we cross the Argentine pampas...
{29076}{29149}ust millions of acres|of rich grazing land...
{29220}{29297}the third largest city|in the Western Hemisphere.
{29322}{29370}Buenos Aires is a beautiful city.
{29370}{29453}This is the plaza de Mayo,|one of its delightful parks;
{29478}{29542}the Teatro Colon,|home of the opera;
{29586}{29681}and the stately Congress building'|centre ofArgentina's government.
{29730}{29798}The tallest building|in South America...
{29802}{29852}the Edificio Cavanaugh.
{29898}{29961}Yes' they were really|impressed with the big city...
{29961}{30021}but impressive' too'|was the lure of the pampas...
{30021}{30105}and the Argentine gaucho|as painted by F. Molina Campos.
{30150}{30198}The party were guests|at his ranch studio...
{30198}{30246}where Senor Campos paints the gaucho...
{30246}{30304}with amazing detail and humour.
{30414}{30462}Seeing these pictures made them|more anxious than ever...
{30462}{30525}to meet these caballeros|in person.
{30612}{30672}And they lived up to their pictures.
{30672}{30723}A real Wild West show...
{30732}{30804}but ust part|of the day's work for a gaucho.
{30819}{30897}Sketching these paisanos|in action was no easy ob.
{31020}{31113}But they did manage to get a good|look at the gaucho's equipment.
{31116}{31187}Silver coins decorate his belt'|or tirador.
{31209}{31257}The sheepskin saddle.
{31269}{31317}Soft horsehide boots.
{31341}{31399}This garment's called a chiri .
{31482}{31553}Here the visitors|were treated to an asado.
{31557}{31630}choice cuts of meat;|mate, the Argentine tea;
{31680}{31741}and wine from their own vineyards.
{31746}{31800}True Argentine hospitality.
{31812}{31884}A group of skilled dancers|entertained the guests.
{31884}{31951}Not the modern tango|of Buenos Aires...
{31956}{32024}but the country dances|of the Argentine.
{32028}{32110}The same tunes to which|their grandparents had danced.
{32508}{32568}Notice how closely|these steps resemble...
{32568}{32640}the old-time square dances|of North America.
{32892}{32967}Gathering picture material|here was a pleasure.
{33573}{33621}Another story was under way.
{33621}{33726}And after seeing Senor Campos' paintings|and all this colourful exhibition...
{33726}{33786}we couldn't help but compare|the life of the Argentine gaucho...
{33786}{33840}with that of our own cowboy.
{33840}{33927}And they reached way back|into Texas to find a leading man.
{33927}{33990}From the windswept plains|of Montana...
{33990}{34060}to the sunbaked banks|of the Rio Grande...
{34062}{34137}over countless miles|of mountain and prairie...
{34146}{34238}untouched and unsullied by|the mercenary hand of civilization...
{34266}{34339}roams a tough'|hardy and heroic breed of man:
{34362}{34415}the North American cowboy.
{34422}{34483}Strong' silent and weather-beaten.
{34557}{34601}Howdy' strangers.
{34605}{34665}This colourful cowhand|of the great West...
{34665}{34742}has his counterpart|in the South American gaucho.
{34749}{34837}Over land and sea' over rugged|mountains and dense ungles...
{34881}{34979}down across the equator to the lush'|grassy pampas of the Argentine...
{35001}{35051}the home of the gaucho.
{35097}{35181}Now' the cowboys of both|Americas have much in common...
{35193}{35275}although their costume|differs in a few minor details.
{35277}{35353}We substitute bombachas|for chaps; the sombrero.
{35373}{35421}Then there's the saco,|the tirador...
{35421}{35474}the chiri and the panuelo.
{35625}{35685}Then' finally'|we have the poncho...
{35685}{35746}which ust about covers everything.
{35805}{35889}The gaucho's closest friend|and inseparable companion...
{35889}{35939}is his horse' or pingo.
{36057}{36105}Quickly the gaucho|reaches for his lasso!
{36105}{36189}Twirling the rawhide above his head'|he deftly tosses the noose|about the horse's neck...
{36189}{36237}and easily subdues|the spirited animal...
{36237}{36302}with the help|of the snubbing post...
{36321}{36360}or palenque.
{36393}{36464}Thanks to the palenque,|or snubbing post...
{36465}{36561}the horse is soon brought under|control and is ready for the saddle.
{36681}{36752}While it appears complex|at first glance...
{37050}{37110}adding the cinchas,|bastos, sheepskin' pigskin...
{37110}{37175}bridle' bit and' finally'|the gaucho.
{37254}{37302}When riding the range at night...
{37302}{37387}the saddle may be quickly|converted into a bed' or catre.
{37398}{37429}Bed?
{37554}{37626}One of the gaucho's|favourite sports is the asado...
{37626}{37675}or Argentine barbecue.
{37698}{37754}Over an open charcoal fire...
{37758}{37826}thick' uicy'|tender steaks are prepared.
{37842}{37913}And' amigos'|it fairly melts in your mouth.
{38061}{38133}The gaucho's method|of eating looks quite simple...
{38133}{38203}yet requires|a certain amount of practice.
{38205}{38275}The bread and meat|are held in one hand...
{38277}{38313}the knife in the other.
{38313}{38361}Note the action|ofwrist and elbow...
{38361}{38444}as knife and food synchronize|in deft' graceful rhythm.
{38481}{38534}One' two' bite' cut' chew.
{38565}{38622}One' a-two' a-bite' cut' chew.
{38661}{38721}Yes' it is this wholesome diet|that builds...
{38721}{38798}the gaucho's nerves of steel|and muscles of iron.
{38841}{38901}And now the boleadoras, or bolas.
{38913}{38997}The bolas consists of three lead|weights covered with rawhide...
{38997}{39057}and is often used for sport'|such as capturing...
{39057}{39135}that swift-moving bird of the|pampas' the Argentine ostrich...
{39135}{39175}or avestruz..
{39195}{39255}Unlike most members|of the ostrich family...
{39255}{39327}the avestruz. is not equipped|with ornamental tail plumage.
{39327}{39409}Its slender legs make|excellent targets for the bolas.
{39423}{39467}Did he say bolas?
{39543}{39627}Dashing at breakneck speed' the gaucho|whirls the bolas 'round and 'round...
{39627}{39693}faster and faster'|and then the throw!
{39879}{39958}And now to fully appreciate|this remarkable feat...
{39975}{40023}let us study the action...
{40023}{40093}through the eye|of the slow-motion camera.
{40119}{40174}Note the grace and beauty...
{40179}{40256}of this light-footed creature|in startled flight.
{40311}{40397}With delicate balance and|clocklike precision of timing...
{40419}{40476}man and beast moving as one...
{40503}{40565}display a minimum ofwaste motion...
{40623}{40686}as the whirling bolas are unleashed.
{40839}{40923}Faster and faster!|On and on they spin' closer and closer!
{40923}{40995}Here they come! Be careful!|Get out of the way! Heads up! Watch it!
{40995}{41046}Look out' look out!|Here it comes! Duck' duck' duck!
{41046}{41092}Too late! Too late!
{41298}{41341}And when night--
{41346}{41392}When night falls...
{41403}{41498}the lone gaucho oft-times finds|himseIf far' far out on the pampas.
{41526}{41603}Listen to the melancholy|strains of the triste...
{41610}{41660}a sad' romantic ballad.
{42411}{42471}But the gaucho is not always sad.
{42471}{42555}Come' let us dance to|the lively beat of the chacarera...
{42555}{42617}the dance of the farmer's daughter.
{42711}{42761}Combining the minuet...
{42771}{42837}the bunny hug|and a dash ofumping ive.
{42867}{42930}The pampas version of cutting a rug.
{42975}{43018}And EIMalambo...
{43023}{43117}a solo number in which the dancer|swings out with utter abandon...
{43131}{43213}often described as|perpetual motion below the equator.
{43539}{43612}Traditional dance|of the rooster and the hen.
{43947}{44037}And now' as he sways to|the gentle undulations of EIMalambo...
{44043}{44112}we gently waft|our transplanted cowboy...
{44139}{44187}back to his prairie homeland.
{44187}{44259}Here we leave him|with warm and tender memories...
{44259}{44340}of his visit to the gay'|romantic land of the gaucho.
{44652}{44734}And now from the pampas|to Brazil and Rio deJaneiro...
{44736}{44811}a city of amazing beauty|and a perfect setting.
{45027}{45111}One of the best views of the city|is from the top of Sugarloaf...
{45111}{45191}overlooking Copacabana Beach'|the playground of Rio.
{45255}{45318}From Corcovado' the Statue|of the Saviour looks out...
{45318}{45384}upon these scenes|of active city life.
{45438}{45520}This is the kind of atmosphere|the artists were after:
{45531}{45578}the outdoor cafes...
{45603}{45680}the mosaic sidewalks|that are found all over Rio.
{45705}{45783}These designs are a tribute|to patience and artistry...
{45783}{45843}preserving a Brazilian tradition.
{45891}{45958}Here are some|of the first impressions.
{46011}{46071}This is what can happen to a big city|when a crowd of cartoonists...
{46071}{46115}are turned loose.
{46260}{46320}Among the sketches|was a promising actor...
{46320}{46416}Old Papagaio' the parrot featured|in most of Brazil's funny stories.
{46506}{46598}With the help of the wardrobe|department' he becomesJoe Carioca.
{46626}{46682}The music of Brazil' a samba.
{46716}{46784}Rhythm instruments|like the reco reco...
{46806}{46850}and the cabaca...
{46872}{46951}all help to beat out|that intricate samba rhythm...
{46980}{47039}a lively two-step with a bounce.
{47094}{47154}It's the same rhythm that|captivates the whole city...
{47154}{47213}when carnival time comes around.
{47736}{47780}Carnival in Rio--
{47784}{47843}three hilarious days and nights.
{47844}{47904}Singing' dancing and celebrating.
{47916}{48008}The spirit of the Mardi Gras|and New Year's Eve rolled into one.
{48156}{48255}Each year hundreds of songs are written|especially for this occasion...
{48267}{48372}and the dream of every composer is to|have his song chosen as a carnival hit.
{48390}{48492}One number stood out as a perfect|background for the first Brazilian film.
{48498}{48582}Its author' Ary Barroso'|has made use of the samba rhythm...
{48582}{48656}to paint a musical picture|of his native land.
{48714}{48765}A watercolour of Brazil.
{52500}{52553}What happened? Where am I?
{52572}{52627}What's going on around here?
{52728}{52772}Boy' this is fun!
{52908}{52941}Uh-oh.
{52968}{53017}What's this? A parrot?
{53460}{53503}"Chosé Carioco.
{53532}{53572}Rio de' uh...

{53808}{53839}Huh?
{53880}{53954}My card? I know I brought one|from the States.
{53988}{54033}Ah. There you are.
{54132}{54175}"Donald Duck"?
{54180}{54236}O Pato Donald! O Pato Donald!
{54552}{54593}O Pato Donald!

{55143}{55203}- Huh?|- "let's go see the town."
{55203}{55256}Okay' Joe! Where do we go?
{55263}{55337}Donald' I will show you|the land of the samba.
{55359}{55406}Samba? What's samba?
{55419}{55460}Ha! The samba!

Ichabod and Mr Toad
Ichabod
Ichabod and Mr Toad
Ichabod, Ichabod and Mr Toad...
If you chose the most fabulous character in English literature,
who would it be?
Robin Hood? King Arthur?
Becky Sharp?
Sherlock Holmes?
Oliver Twist, perhaps?
Any one of them would be an excellent choice.
But as the most fabulous character of all, I nominate
a toad.
J Thaddeus Toad, Esquire.
Have you never met him?
You'll find his story in
"The Wind in the Willows".
Toad was the one disturbing element.
Incurable adventurer, mad, reckless, tried everything.
A positive mania for fads, and he never counted the cost.
He had a host of fair-weather friends.
But there were only three who had his best interests at heart.
One was a badger. MacBadger.
And then there was a water rat.
A bit stuffy, perhaps, but really a fine fellow. And a mole.
A gentle creature, kind and sympathetic.
They all made their homes in a quaint community along a riverbank.
On that particular day, Mole was in a hurry because...
 because he was late for tea.
A regrettable habit, but Rat had learned to put up with it.
Sorry, says Mole. Quite alright, says Rat. Two lumps?
Then, just as they were getting settled...
- Special Delivery, Mr Rat.
- Thank you, Postman.
How's everything on the river, sir?
Dashed quiet, as usual, thank you.
Mole, listen.
"Dear Rat: You and Mole must come to Toad Hall at once."
"Urgent!! A MacBadger."
Rat was certain Toad was making trouble again.
The answer to that lay just around the bend at Toad Hall,
the ancestral home of
J Thaddeus himself.
This impressive structure was the finest home on the river.
The animals were tremendously proud of it.
They felt it gave the whole community an air of respectability.
To lose Toad Hall was, of course, unthinkable,
and yet it was no secret that Toad's follies
had brought him to the brink of bankruptcy.
So, MacBadger had volunteered to put Toad's house in order.
Smashed fence. Two guineas.
Damage, lamp post. Four pound six.
Destruction of hen house...
How can a man figure with all this hubbub?
- I'll not be put off!
- Pay my bill!
- I want my money!
- Silence!
You'll get your money in due course.
Now, go along with you.
I'll pay no more today.
Why did I assume the responsibility of looking after...
Didn't I tell you...?
It's you, Rat. And Mole, too.
Thank goodness, lads.
You've come at last.
Poor MacBadger. He'd reached the end of his rope.
As he said himself...
I'm practically a nervous wreck.
I say! What seems to be the trouble?
Summat's got to be done about Toad!
This time he's gone too far!
But he promised us...
Promises? What good are promises when wild manias take him?
Now, look, you're his closest friends, are you not?
- Yes.
- Very dear friends.
Then you must find
Toad and stop him!
- What's he doing?
- He's got a new mania.
He's rampaging about the county in a canary-yellow gypsy cart.
With a horse named Cyril.
Tally-ho!
Are we on our way to Nottingham, to Brittingham, to Buckingham
Or any hammy hamlet by the sea? No!
Are we on our way to Devonshire, to Lancashire or Worcestershire?
I'm not so sure
We'll have to wait and see
Are we on our way to Dover?
Or going merrily over
The jolly old road that goes to Plymouth Ho?
No! We're merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
On our way to nowhere in particular
We're merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily on our way
Though the roads are perpendicular
- We're always in a hurry
- We have no time to stall
We've gotta be there
We've gotta be there
But where, we can't recall
We're merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily on our way
And we may be going to Devonshire, to Lancashire, to Worcestershire
We're not so sure, but what do we care?
We're only sure we've got to be there
We're merrily on our way to nowhere at all
Hello, you fellows!
You're the very animals
I was coming to see!
Come along! Hop up!
We'll go for a jolly ride!
The open road, the dusty highway. Come!
I'll show you the world.
Travel, change, excitement...
How stupid of me! I want you fellows to meet my noble steed Cyril.
Aye, that's me.
A bit of a trotter, a bit of a rotter.
How do you do, how do you do, how do you do?
How do you do?
Say, guv'nor, your friends seem a bit on the stuffy side.
Toad, we want to have a talk with you.
A visit! Splendid!
This is serious. You must give up that horse and cart.
Give up my... But my dear
Ratty, this is my career!
- You can't mean...
- I do!
- You must stop this foolishness!
- No.
- You must!
- No. I won't do it.
Your reckless behaviour is giving animals a bad name!
You're becoming a menace to society.
At least think of poor MacBadger!
And as for that horse, no good will come of gadding about with such a fast and irresponsible beast!
- Get him, Mole!
- Come down, Toady.
Stop it! Let me go!
Giddy up, Cyril! Giddy up!
It's no use. You'll never get me to give this up!
Tally-ho! Yikes!
Look!
Gad! What is it?
- Lummy, guv'nor, it's a motorcar.
- Motorcar?
A motorcar... Gad! What have I been missing?
- Ratty, it isn't... He hasn't...
- It is, and he has.
A new mania. Motor mania.
Mania.
That's it. That's what it was.
A positive mania.
No telling where it would end.
Might linger for months.
And with Toad Hall at stake,
Rat and Mole had no choice.
Only one thing to do.
Lock the poor chap up until the poison worked out of his system.
Hold him, Moley!
- That's better.
- And you can't escape.
Simply no use trying.
Let me out! Open up, I say! Please!
Open the door!
Playing jailer to one's dearest friend wasn't pleasant.
In fact, Moley immediately wanted to call it quits, but Ratty said no.
This time they must be firm.
It wasn't just a matter of saving Toad from himself.
There was MacBadger to consider, and
Toad Hall and all it stood for.
There was only one thing wrong with Ratty's cure for motor mania.
It didn't work. You see,
Toad was far too clever.
And, at the moment, completely mad.
He was determined to get a motorcar,
even if he had to beg, borrow or...
Toad arrested! Extra!
His Majesty versus J
Thaddeus Toad, Toad Hall,
Riverbank, Doodle-Bunton-
Maxon-Morton, Surrey.
24th day of August, set forth in the following brief.
Accused is J Thaddeus Toad, of stealing a motorcar, and with it, endangering sundry subjects of His Majesty,
- their life and limbs.
- Counsel for the Crown, proceed with the case.
My lord, I call, as first Crown witnesses,
Mr Rat and Mr Mole!
Is it true that you had the accused locked in his own house because he had threatened to get a motorcar?
Did you, or did you not, have him locked up?
- We did.
- Thank you! That is all!
- Next witness.
- Mr Angus MacBadger!
As trustee of the Toad estate, you knew of the prisoner's mania for motorcars?
And due to his extravagance, you cut off his allowance?
Then he was, to the best of your knowledge, without funds?
That is all! Thank you!
Gentlemen of the jury, the Crown rests.
Counsel for the defence will present his case.
My lord, with the court's indulgence,
I rise prepared to plead my own defence.
Stop it.
Gentlemen of the jury...
I call, as my first witness, Cyril Proudbottom.
Are you acquainted with the defendant, J Thaddeus Toad?
Lord love a duck, yes! He's one of the jolliest chaps I've run across.
And simply tons of money.
Good fellow? Throws it away.
But he wasn't throwing it away that day!
You heard Mr MacBadger testify that his allowance was cut off.
Then how did he get a motorcar?
The only way a gentleman gets anything.
- The honest way.
- And what is the honest way?
I thought you wouldn't know!
Your Lordship, I...
The witness may testify in his own words.
Righto, guv'nor.
I'll just give you the facts.
When Toady escaped from his boudoir he headed straight for my place.
Soon we was off down the highway,
but we hadn't gone far, I confess, when, with a rush and a roar...
 something passed like the London Express.
It was big, it was red, it was beautiful.
A motorcar, a bit of alright.
Toady was transfixed with... rapture.
You could tell it was love at first sight.
The motor pulled up to a tavern, wherein was located a bar.
And we watched while some tough-looking weasels
got out of that lovely red car.
Now, weasels, I know, are deceitful.
And not to be trusted, at all.
But how could I know they'd stolen that car?
I didn't have no crystal ball.
The guv'nor is not one to dally.
He made up his mind like a flash. He says...
Try it for size, my good Cyril,
while I see what they'll take for it, cash.
Into the tavern he saunters, where the barman was back of the bar.
And he said,
Cheerio, tavern keeper. Who's the owner of that... hot-looking car?
The barman, a codger named Winky, leaned over the bar and said,
- Why?
- The guv'nor answered,
That car must be mine!
Whatever the price is, I'll buy.
But Toad found he hadn't no money.
So, he promptly offered a trade.
The weasels appeared to be willing.
In a moment, the bargain was made.
Toady drawed up a paper, with almost incredible speed.
He called on old Winky the barman
to... pop over and witness the deed.
Now, the guv'nor is not a bit stingy.
He never does anything small.
The weasels gave him the red motorcar, and he gave the weasels Toad Hall.
Traded Toad Hall? An estate worth £100,000 for a motorcar?
You expect me to believe that?
I don't expect you to believe anything.
Fortunately, I can produce a witness. Call Mr Winky!
My lord, gentlemen, facing you in the witness box is a citizen of substance and standing.
A man of unimpeachable honesty.
Now, Mr Winky, do you recall an incident that took place in your... establishment last August 12th, that I was a party to?
Yes, sir, that I do.
Well, then... just tell the court what actually happened.
Well, guv'nor, you tried to sell me a stolen motorcar.
That's a deliberate lie, you monkey-faced rum pot!
I've been framed! Let me go! Help!
Toad guilty!
Toad's disgrace rocked the nation.
The court was determined to make an example of him.
Toad's friends tried to help him, but were always blocked.
They must've reopened the case a dozen times.
Appeals to this court, that court any court. But the decision stood.
The case of J Thaddeus
Toad was closed.
Merry, merry Christmas time
Bind every heart with happiness
Let everyone...
Yes, once again, it was a white Christmas.
Melodies of Yuletide hung sweet upon the winter's air.
Hearts were gay and spirits high.
Indeed, in all the city,
only one spot was untouched by the warmth of Christmas cheer.
The Tower, grim monument to
despair. Cold, cruel, forbidding,
and the abode of Toad for a good many Christmases to come.
Poor Toad. Alone with memories of his wasted life.
What a fool he'd been!
With many a pang he recalled the kindly face of Angus MacBadger,
and his sage advice, so often scorned.
A tear for Moley, too, for his loyalty, sympathy, understanding.
Toad wept for Rat, and all those little lectures so often laughed at.
Yes, within the dark confines of his miserable cell,
a new Toad was born. A reformed
Toad, a repentant Toad.
In a flood of remorse, he vowed to forsake the follies
of the Primrose path.
Never again would he give way to those mad, foolish manias
that had brought him to this sorry end.
As it's Christmas, you're allowed a visitor.
- Your grandma's here.
- Grandma?
Merry Christmas, sonny!
Granny wouldn't forget her little Toady boy!
Look, Christmas gift.
- What is it?
- Don't you get it?
A disguise.
All you've got to do is put on this natty little costume and...
Alas for good intentions.
Toad was incurable.
One whispered word and all his high resolve
vanished in the mad whirl of this new adventure.
This new mania! Escape!
Toad's escaped!
Halt!
Good evening, ma'am.
Good evening to you, Officer.
We're merrily, merrily, merrily...
Begging your pardon, but you...
You fellows, do you see him?
Gad, what perfectly ripping luck!
Trap Toad, would they?
Never!
- There he goes!
- Where?
Over there!
Blockheads! Let them scour the countryside.
Once more, J Thaddeus
Toad had the last laugh.
That Christmas Eve, along the riverbank,
the name of Toad was banned from conversation,
lest the memory of his disgrace becloud the merriment of the season.
Yet there was one home, at least, in which two loyal hearts
still held the warmth of Christian charity.
Bless this good food we are about to enjoy.
Bless us, every one.
And... bless poor Toad.
And may he get time off for good behaviour.
Why, it's a poor old lady.
Let's take her over by the fire.
What are you doing here?
I was just sort of...
Well, this is a merry Christmas!
But... aren't you afraid of the police?
Afraid of the police?
I, Toad, afraid of the police?
- Open up, I say!
- The police!
Hide me, Ratty!
Sorry, but you owe a debt to society.
And you've got to pay.
Mole, let them in.
But, Ratty, don't you think, maybe...
Open the door!
Hi, lads!
I've just made a very important discovery.
Toad Hall is ablaze with lights
and in possession of a pack of weasels.
And the leader of the gang is none other than Mr...
Winky!
Hip, hip...
Hooray!
And so, you see, he did trade Toad Hall for the motorcar!
- Toad was innocent all the time.
- Aye, lads.
And if he were only here right now...
- Toad!
- Angus!
Sorry, Toad, I misjudged you.
I hope, someday, you'll find it in your heart...
Not another word.
To err is human, to forgive...
Not so fast!
You're still guilty in the eyes of the law.
To prove your innocence, we've got to get that paper away from Winky!
Now, I have a plan.
We'll sneak in through the secret tunnel.
It was an expert plan, cunningly contrived but extremely dangerous.
It would work only if each did his part. There was no margin for error.
The odds against them were tremendous, but the stakes were high.
But now, steady's the word...
One false move and four lives hang in the balance.
Careful, lads. There is a guard.
- I'll pop him off!
- Don't shoot!
Who goes there?
That was a close one.
Trust Toad to start things off on the wrong foot.
No turning back now. Nothing for it but to push on.
What new and greater perils lay ahead, no one could say.
Toad had already got out of hand, so anything could happen.
Look. They're all asleep.
Lads, they're drunk.
They've been hitting the bottle.
But where is Winky?
There he is!
He's got the paper on him!
We'll have to climb up on the balcony.
The paper! It's gone!
Get him, you blokes!
I beg your pardon!
Over here!
After it!
- Just one more!
- There he is! Get him!
Where's Moley?
Well, laddies, we saved our skins, but we didn't get the deed.
Well done!
Hip, hip, hooray!
So, it was a happy ending, after all.
Toad's friends were dreadfully proud of him. And why not?
He was a new Toad, completely reformed,
through with gypsy carts and motorcars for ever.
And so, on this happiest of New
Years, a toast was in order.
- To the New Year and...
- To the new Toad!
Hello, you fellows!
Come! I'll show you the world.
Travel, change, excitement...
That was the fabulous
Thaddeus Toad.
But let's weigh our judgement carefully,
we Moles and Rats and Badgers.
Don't we envy him a bit?
I know I do.
When we speak of fabulous characters,
the most fabulous will always be, to me,
the master of Toad Hall.
Yes! J Thad was quite a lad!
Speaking of fabulous characters,
England has produced a bumper crop.
But here in the colonies, we have a few of our own.
Paul Bunyan, Pecos Bill,
Johnny Appleseed, Black Bart,
Davy Crockett, Daniel Boone.
And, of course, the one and only Ichabod Crane.
Ichy was the country schoolmaster dreamed up by Washington Irving.
He had a way with a yarn did Mr Irving.
If we could journey back to that period in history
when Manhattan was but a market town,
we would discover, in one of the coves
which indent the shores of the Hudson,
the little village of Tarry Town.
And just beyond, nestled deep in the low rolling hills,
a sequestered glen.
It's a quiet, peaceful place,
and yet, somehow... foreboding.
It abounds in haunted spots,
twilight tales and local superstitions.
The best-known story concerns an itinerant schoolmaster
who once frequented these parts.
Some say his melancholy spirit still haunts the vicinity.
The pedagogue was described as a most unusual man.
To see him striding along,
one might mistake him for a scarecrow eloped from a cornfield.
He was tall, but exceedingly lank.
His head was small and flat on top, with a long, snipe nose.
It looked like a weathercock perched upon his spindle neck.
Altogether, he was an apparition seldom to be seen in broad daylight.
Late one drowsy autumn afternoon,
this strange figure first approached Sleepy Hollow.
As usual, there had gathered
at Ye Olde Schnooker and Schnapps Shoppe
a group of rustic lads, the Sleepy Hollow boys.
Their self-appointed leader, Brom Bones,
was a burly, roistering blade, always ready for a fight or a frolic.
Though Brom was given to madcap pranks and practical jokes,
there was no malice in his mischief.
With his waggish humour and prodigious strength,
Brom Bones was quite the hero, all the country round.
Odds bodkins! Gadzooks!
Look at that old spook of spooks.
Who's that coming down the street?
Are they shovels or are they feet?
Lean and lanky
Skin and bone
With clothes a scarecrow would hate to own
Yet, he has a certain air
Debonair and devil-may-care
It's the new schoolmaster
What's his name?
Ichabod
Ichabod Crane
What a name!
Kind of odd
But nice just the same
Funny pan, funny frame
Ichabod may be quaint
May be odd, and maybe he ain't
Anyway, there's no complaint
From Ichabod, Ichabod Crane...
Though the arrival of the pedagogue gave rise to mixed emotions,
the townspeople all agreed they'd never seen anyone...
Like Ichabod, Ichabod Crane
The schoolroom became
Ichabod's empire,
over which, with lordly dignity, he held absolute sway.
Truth to say, Ichabod was a conscientious man,
and ever bore in mind the maxim spare the rod and spoil the child.
Still, he was careful to administer justice
with discrimination.
For it behoved him to keep on good terms with his pupils.
Especially if their mothers happened to be good cooks.
Who's the town's ladies' man?
Gets around like nobody can
Has to be none other than...
As time went by, it may be seen that the pedagogue
got on tolerably enough.
Moreover, Ichabod found ways to increase his slender income
and, at the same time,
awaken the cultural interests of the sleepy little village.
It was inevitable that a man like Ichabod
would become an object of ridicule to Brom Bones and his gang.
Yet, to Ichabod, these were small matters.
He possessed a remarkable equanimity
which remained quite undisturbed until
that fateful day, when his path was crossed by a woman.
A certain woman.
Katrina Van Tassel, only child of Baltus Van Tassel,
the richest farmer in the county.
She was a blooming lass, plump as a partridge.
Ripe, melting and rosy-cheeked.
Once you have met that little coquette Katrina
You won't forget Katrina
But nobody yet has ever upset Katrina
That cute coquette Katrina
You can do more with
Margaret or Helena
Or Anne or Angelina
But Katrina will kiss and run
To her, a romance is fun
With always another one to start
And yet when you've met that little coquette Katrina
You've lost your heart
There was no doubt the fair Katrina
was the richest prize in the countryside.
The schoolmaster, being an ambitious man,
began to fill his mind with many sugared thoughts
and hopeful suppositions.
Katrina, my love.
Who can resist your grace?
Your charm?
And who can resist your father's farm?
Boy, what a set-up!
There's gold in them acres, and that ain't hay.
Not to mention that lovely green stuff.
Katrina, my sweet. My treasure.
Treasure...
That barn's a gold mine.
How I'd love to hit the jackpot.
Dear Katrina. Papa's only child.
Papa!
The old goat can't take it with him.
When he cuts out, that's where I cut in.
Sweet Katrina, poor little rich girl.
But don't worry, Katie,
Ichabod will protect you.
Yes, Katrina, you've won me.
I surrender.
And yet when you've met that little coquette Katrina
You've lost your heart
Every portal to Katrina's heart was jealously guarded
by a host of rustic admirers.
But Ichabod was confident he'd soon ride roughshod
over these simple country bumpkins.
But the most formidable obstacle he had failed to reckon with.
That was the redoubtable
Brom Bones.
The ease with which Brom cleared the field of rivals
both piqued and provoked the fair Katrina.
She often wished that some champion would appear
and take the field openly against the boisterous Brom.
A wiser man would have shrunk from the competition,
but love is blind.
Ichabod was aware only that Dame Fortune
was at last thundering at his door.
It's true that Brom liked a joke as well as the next,
but enough was too much.
It was time for open warfare.
He'd double that schoolmaster up
and lay him on a shelf in his schoolhouse!
But this was easier said than done.
No doubt of it, this was
Ichabod's lucky day.
The schoolmaster was a man of hidden talents,
a rival to be reckoned with.
Still, wars are neither won nor lost at the first encounter.
The high-flyer might yet be brought to earth.
For Brom Bones was never a man to cry quits.
On the occasion of her father's annual Halloween frolic,
Katrina chose to stir the embers of the smouldering rivalry.
One invitation in particular carried a most personal summons.
The worthy schoolmaster was in a transport of joy.
To him, this could mean but one thing.
Ichy, you sly old dog, you!
What is this strange power you have over women?
Well, tonight's the night, boy!
Just turn on the old charm.
The fair Katrina is yours for the asking.
Gaily bedecked and nobly mounted on a horse he had borrowed,
Ichabod issued forth like a knight errant of old
to keep a tryst with his lady fair.
There was nothing to equal the merrymaking
at Mynheer Van Tassel's farm.
To Ichabod, here was a perfect field for his endeavours.
How would he put his best foot forward!
Beyond all his other talents, he prided himself upon his dancing.
Unhappy Brom, already bested at every turn,
saw himself once more outmatched.
For as he watched the posturing pedagogue,
he had to admit that here was a flawless picture
of ease and grace.
There was no doubt that Ichabod was the man of the hour.
Brom had to concede his rival another victory.
Yet, there was still a chance his time would come.
For when the hour grew late, Van
Tassel would call on his guests
to tell him ghostly tales of Halloween.
Brom knew there was no more potent believer
in spooks and goblins than Ichabod Crane.
Just gather round and I'll elucidate what goes on outside, when it gets late.
Around about midnight, the ghosts and banshees get together for nightly jamborees.
Things with horns and saucer eyes, and some with fangs about this size!
- Some are fat.
- And some are thin!
And some don't even wear their skin!
I'm telling you, brother, it's a frightful sight what goes on, Halloween night.
When spooks have a midnight jamboree
They break it up with fiendish glee
Ghosts are bad, but the one that's cursed
Is the Headless Horseman, he's the worst
That's right, he's a fright on Halloween night
When he goes a-joggin' across the land
Holdin' his noggin in his hand
Demons take one look and groan
And hit the road for parts unknown
Beware, take care, he rides alone
And there's no spook like a spook who's spurned
They don't like him and he's really burned
He swears to the longest day he's dead
He'll show them that he can get ahead
They say he's tired of his flamin' top
He's got a yen to make a swap
So he rides one night each year
To find a head in the hollow here
Now, he likes them little, he likes them big
Part in the middle, or a wig
Black or white, or even red
The Headless Horseman needs a head
With a hip-hip and a clippity-clop
He's out lookin' for a top to chop
So don't stop to figure out a plan
You can't reason with a headless man
Now, if you doubt this tale is so,
I met that spook just a year ago.
Now, I didn't stop for a second look, but made for the bridge that spans the brook.
For once you cross that bridge, my friends
The ghost is through, his power ends
So, when you're riding home tonight
Make for the bridge with all your might
He'll be down in the hollow there
He needs your head
Look out! Beware!
With a hip-hip and a clippity-clop
He's out lookin' for a head to swap
So don't try to figure out a plan
You can't reason with a headless man
It was the witching hour of night as Ichabod pursued his travel home.
The sky grew darker.
One by one, the stars winked out their lights.
Driving clouds obscured the moon from sight.
Never had the schoolmaster felt so melancholy,
so utterly alone.
The nearer he approached the hollow,
the more dismal he became.
Once inside the murky glen, Ichabod's anxiety increased one-hundredfold.
The forest seemed to close in behind him.
Every small detail of
Brom's awful story
returned to haunt his recollection.
Headless Horseman.
Beware!
Once you cross that bridge, my friends,
the ghost is through, his power ends.
Next morning, Ichabod's hat was found.
And close beside it, a shattered pumpkin.
But there was no trace of the schoolmaster.
Shortly thereafter, Brom Bones led the fair Katrina to the altar.
Rumours persisted that
Ichabod was still alive,
married to a wealthy widow in a distant county.
But the good Dutch settlers refused to believe such nonsense.
They knew the schoolmaster had been spirited away
by the Headless Horseman.
With a hip-hip and a clippity-clop
He's out looking for a head to swap
But don't try to figure out a plan
You can't reason with a headless man
Man, I'm getting out of here!
Make mine music
Make mine music
And my heart will sing
Make mine music
And it's always spring
All the world goes romancing
When melody fills the night
And even the stars go dancing
To the music of the moonlight
Make mine music
And I'll dream of you
Make mine music
And the dream comes true
Music will play the shadows away
When everything seems to go wrong
So make mine music
And life will be a song
Make mine music
Gather round me, children, and I'll tell a story
Of the mountains in the days when guns was law
When two families got disputin'
It was bound to end in shootin'
So just listen and I'll tell you what I saw
Oh, the Martins and the Coys
They was reckless mountain boys
And they took up family feudin' when they'd meet
Every durn time!
They could shot each other quicker than it took your eye to flicker
They could knock a squirrel's eye out at 90 feet
All their fightin' started one bright Sunday morning
I remember!
Cos old Grandpa Coy was full of mountain dew ...
Just as quiet as a church mouse
He stole into the Martins' henhouse
Cos the Coys, they needed eggs for breakfast too
After that they started out to fight in earnest
And they scarred the mountains up with shot and shell
There was uncles, brothers, cousins
Why, they bumped them off by dozens
Just how many bit the dust is hard to tell
Oh, the Martins and the Coys
They were reckless mountain boys
At the art of killin' they became quite deft
Mighty deft
They all knowed they shouldn't do it
But before they hardly knew it
On each side they only had one person left
Only one person left
Now, the sole remaining Martin was a maiden
And as pretty as a picture was this Grace
- While the one survivin' boy
- Was the handsome Henry Coy
And the folks all knew they'd soon meet face to face
- After her, Henry!
- Go get her, boy!
- Knock him off, Gracie!
- Shoot that Coy!
So they finally met upon a mountain pathway
And Henry Coy, he aimed his gun at Grace
Right at Grace
He was set to pull the trigger when he saw her pretty figure
You could see that love had kicked him in the face
Oh, the Martins and the Coys
They were reckless mountain boys
But they say their ghostly cussin' gives you chills
Cos the hatchet sure was buried when sweet Grace and Henry married
It broke up the best durn feud in these here hills
Come on, everybody, let's dance!
Way down yonder, not far off, a jay bird died with the whoopin' cough
Do si do, little more dough, chicken in the bread pan pickin' out dough
"Granny, will your dog bite?". "No, child, no, he lost his teeth a long time ago"
Now swing your partners,
And promenade the hall,
Same old road, same old train
Watch that monkey walk that rail
Now first couple out to the right
Go round that couple and take a peek
Come back to the centre and shake your feet
Round that couple and peek once more
Back in the centre and circle four
Swing your partner and call your hound
Right foot up and left foot down
Bottom of your foot make a hole in the ground
Now you're tall with a smile
Once and a half and go hog wild
Sooey, hog, sooey!
Look at him run!
What's the hurry, Henry?
Now you may think that this is where the story ended
But I'm tellin'you them ghosts don't cuss no more
Cos since Grace and Henry wedded they fight worse than all the rest did
And they carry on the feud just like before
Roll along, blue bayou
Through the silv'ry foam
In the deep where sleepy shadows roam
While we roll, blue bayou
In your dreamy light
Memories echo in my heart tonight
I hear the echo of our song of love
Murmuring low
And here am I
Still haunted by
The ghost of long ago
Roll along, blue bayou
Through the silv'ry foam
Roll the blue and sleepy shadows home
Roll along, blue bayou
Through the silv'ry foam
In the deep where sleepy shadows roam
While we roll, blue bayou
In your dreamy light
Memories echo in my heart tonight
Roll along, blue bayou
Through the silv'ry foam
Roll the blue and sleepy shadows home
Roll along, blue bayou
Through the silv'ry foam
Roll the blue and sleepy shadows home
Across the blue moon
Boy!
Hop in the old jalop and...
Head for the malted shop and...
All the cats join in
Down goes my last two bits
Comes up one banana split
And all the cats join in
Drop your jack in the old jukebox
Play your favourite disc
When you dance with the bobby socks
You dance at your own risk
RIP
Everybody swing
Yes, swing till the rafters ring
And all the cats join in
Rafters ringing, how they're swinging
All the cats join in
I'm so lonely and blue
When I'm without you
I don't know what I'd do, sweetheart.
Without you
The joy and tears that love endears
Would have no meaning
If I didn't have you
To keep me dreaming
At the close of each day
When I'm without you
And my heart kneels to pray
I pray about you
You take a star
And lead it far away from heaven
And the star will be lost
As I'm lost without you
At the close of each day
When I'm without you
And my heart kneels to pray
I pray about you
You take a star
And lead it far away from heaven
And the star will be lost
As I'm lost without you
Oh, what a lark to ride out to the park
And just to see Casey
They travelled for miles and they stand in the aisles
And just to see Casey
The ladies don't understand baseball a bit
They don't know a strike from a foul or a hit
But when they see Casey that dame has got it
Casey, the pride of them all
The outlook wasn't brilliant for the Mudville nine that day
The score was four to two
With but one inning left to play
Listen, ya bunch of bush leaguers, it's the ninth inning!
It's the wind-up! The blow-off!
Come on, unbutton your shirts!
Now get in there and fight!
Who's up next?
Cooney!
The coach was really worried when Cooney went to bat
For all he had to offer was 300 pounds of fat
Ah, but Cooney was determined, he tried to do his worst
He kept his batting average, all right
And as usual died at first
You're out!
Hooray for our side! Hooray! Hooray!
- Aw, shut up!
- Sit down!
- I'll kick the stuffin' out of him!
- Yeah, run that guy outta town!
Barrows was the next one up, and Barrows made a hit
Wow, he smacked a beauty - right in the pitcher's mitt
You're out!
A straggling few got up to go
Ah, but the loyal fans stood pat
They'd put up even money now were Casey at the bat
Ah, but Flynn preceded Casey
Of all the stupid guys
The bat is getting in his hair
Now the hair is getting in his bat
Egad! He let drive a single - much to his own surprise
Safe!
The next one in the line-up was "No Hit" Jimmy Blake
Of all the mugs in Mudville he was the biggest fake
But he was really blazing and to the wonderment of all
Blake the Fake tore the cover off the ball
And when the dust had lifted and they saw what had occurred
There was Jimmy safe at second and Flynn a-huggin' third
Cosy, isn't it?
You're safe!
We want Casey! We want Casey!
We want Casey!
Oh, Casey's the guy with his eye on the ball
But mostly the ladies
Casey's the guy who's the idol of all
But mostly the ladies
Casey is mighty and manly
Casey's a dangerous gent
Egad, when he goes to bat, hang onto your hat
He's batting a thousand percent with the ladies
Oh, Casey has nerve and he knows every curve
He's no hokey-pokey
He gets away with that old double play
He's sure okey-dokey
He makes all the ladies go gaga, it's true
No wonder they swoon when he comes into view
He was the Sinatra of 1902
Casey, the pride of them all
The pitcher's nerves were jagged and his knees began to shake
Ah, can't catch me! Can't catch me!
One eye was watching Flynn and the other eye watching Blake
While the frightened pitcher ground the ball into his hip
Defiance gleamed in Casey's eye
A sneer curled Casey's lip
And now the leather-covered sphere came hurtling through the air
And Casey stood a-watching it in haughty grandeur there
Close by the sturdy batsman the ball unheeded sped
"That ain't my style," said Casey
Strike one!
... the umpire said
From the benches, black with people, there went up a mighty roar
Like the beating of the ocean on a stern and distant shore
Kill him! Kill the umpire!
... yelled the cutie from the stand
And it's likely they'd have killed him
Had not Casey raised his hand
With a smile of Christian charity great Casey's visage shone
He stilled the rising tumult and bade the game go on
He signalled to the pitcher and once more the spheroid flew
But Casey still ignored it and the umpire said, quote:
Strike two!
Unquote.
"Fraud!" cried the maddened thousands, and the echo answered "Fraud!"
But one scornful look from Casey...
And the audience was awed
They saw his face grow stern and cold
They saw his muscles strain
And they knew that Casey would not let that ball go by again
The sneer has gone from Casey's lip
His teeth are clenched in hate
He pounds with cruel violence his bat upon the plate
And now the pitcher holds the ball
And now he lets it go
And now the air is shattered by the force of Casey's blow
Somewhere in this favoured land
The sun is shining bright
Ah, yes...
Somewhere bands are playing sweet
And somewhere hearts are light
Somewhere men are laughing
Somewhere children shout
But there is no joy in Mudville -
Mighty Casey has struck out
Casey, the pride of them all!
Whaddaya know? The game is over.
Two silhouettes
Together in the afterglow
Two silhouettes
Become as one
When lights are low
And with the night slumbering on
We'll build a dream for two
A perfect dream
Set to a theme lovely as you
Two hearts on fire
Will soon inspire
The stars to dance
The flames that stray
Will light the way
To our romance
And when I hold you in my arms
To my heart's delight
Two silhouettes will drift away into the night
Two hearts on fire
Will soon inspire
The stars to dance
The flames that stray
Will light the way
To our romance
And when I hold you in my arms
To my heart's delight
Two silhouettes
Will drift away
Into the night
Will drift away
Into the night
Now, this is the story of...
Peter and the Wolf.
As you know, in the musical score of Peter and the Wolf each character is represented by an instrument in the orchestra -
Peter by the string quartet.
The bird, whose name is Sasha, by a flute, way up high.
Sonia, the duck, by an oboe. Like this...
And here is Ivan, the cat, represented by a clarinet in a very low register.
Grandpapa is an old bassoon.
The shooting of the hunters' guns by the kettledrums.
And there is also a wolf.
Little does that wolf know what's in store for him this day.
For our hero, little Peter, armed to the teeth, is setting forth to capture him.
There seems to have been a change of plans.
For Peter's grandpapa thinks that little boys like Peter should not go out to hunt the wolf.
This is very embarrassing for a great hunter.
This is Sasha, the little bird we told you about.
Excitable little chap, isn't he?
Forgetful, too.
"Hello, Petey. Where you goin'?
Can I go, Petey? Can I?"
"Oh, boy, a gun!"
"Loaded, too. "
"Goin' hunting? Oh, that's for me!"
"Everything's OK, Petey.
Come on, let's go. "
The wolf!
But it isn't the wolf at all.
It's only Sonia the duck.
"Hello, Sonia. "
"Hello, Petey. "
Now Sonia wants to join the party.
Imagination is a wonderful thing.
But sometimes it can run away with you.
"You coward!"
Now who's this?
Oh, it can't be...
Oh, no. It's Ivan the cat.
Hello, Ivan.
Ivan's a peaceful, fun-loving sort - maybe a little shy on brains. You know the type.
Hey, look out, Sasha!
"Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it!"
Oh, how can they ever get any place if they're going to fight among themselves?
Ivan, you ought to be ashamed.
"You big bully!"
"You cat in the grass!"
Come on, Sasha. Ivan's sorry.
He won't do it again.
And so, once more, our little band of intrepid hunters sets forth to find the wolf.
And they find him.
Sonia! Sonia!
Behind you! Look out!
W-O-L-F!
Oh, that wolf is everywhere!
Peter, do something!
Oh, no.
Look, Peter, why don't you...
Maybe if you could...
Then maybe, Peter... Oh, well...
Peter, don't just stand that way.
Don't stand that way, either.
Oh, Sonia!
This is no time to relax.
Poor Sonia.
Well, that's one gone.
Goodbye, Sonia.
Will this crime go unavenged?
Not if little Sasha can help it.
You beast!
Take this! And this! And this!
How do you like this, eh?
And this, eh?
How about this, eh?
Not so good, eh?
Good work, Sasha!
Trouble.
Sasha! Sasha, get up!
Get up! Get out of there!
Look out, please, for over-confidence.
This is bad.
This is very bad.
Saved!
Just when things are looking blackest...
Hark! What's that we hear?
What's this we see?
The hunters!
Misha, Yasha and Vladimir.
That's Vladimir in the middle.
Wait a minute, I'll show you.
W-O-L-F. Wolf.
Wolf?
To the rescue!
Oh, Peter, you're safe!
You've captured the wolf.
Oh, happy day!
I think I'll say that again.
Oh, happy day!
Oh, Peter, what a hero!
You too, Ivan.
Everybody's happy - except the wolf.
But little Sasha isn't happy.
He's thinking of his lost playmate, Sonia.
Sonia...
Sonia?
Sonia! Then you're not dead!
You're safe!
Oh, Sonia, this is the most wonderful, wonderful day!
The wolf is captured - Peter caught him!
One, two, three...
Johnnie Fedora met Alice Bluebonnet
In the window of a department store
'Twas love at first sight
And they promised one night
They'd be sweethearts for evermore
Johnnie would serenade Alice
Toora-lay, toora-li, toora-lu
He sang of a beautiful palace
Of a beautiful hatbox for two
But Johnnie Fedora lost Alice Bluebonnet
To a patron of the department store
Her beauty was sought by the girl she was bought by
For twenty-three ninety-four
Johnnie, O Johnnie
Your Alice Bluebonnet
Will always be waiting for you
So don't give up hoping
And don't give up dreaming
For true love will come smiling through
Johnnie Fedora was lonely and stranded
In the window of the department store
When, lo and behold
He was suddenly sold
And his heart became gay once more
Johnnie sang out like a robin
Toora-lay, toora-li, toora-lu
To strangers he'd come up a-bobbin'
"I thought you were someone I knew "
He looked for her uptown and crosstown and downtown
From the Brooklyn Bridge to the Jersey shore
It all seemed in vain
Till he heard the refrain
Of the song Alice sang of yore
Johnnie, O Johnnie!
Your Alice Bluebonnet
Will always be waiting for you
So don't give up hoping
And don't give up dreaming
For true love will come smiling through
Johnnie kept yearning, he kept on returning
To the window of the department store
His voice became hushed
He was literally crushed
And it started to rain and pour
Each place he went he kept calling
- Toora-lay
- Toora-li
- Toora-lu
- La la la
His spirits kept falling and falling
For his Alice was nowhere in view
But hey-noni-noni, an ice man found Johnnie
And he cut him to fit on his horse's ears
'Twas done without malice
For beside him was Alice
And they lived on for years and years
Giddup!
You Johnnie Fedoras
You Alice Bluebonnets
Whenever you find yourself blue
You'll find it's June in December
If you just remember
That true love will come smiling through
That true love will come smiling through
This is how it all began
Just a little back-page item about a voice that sang at sea
And then this fantastic news appeared on the front page
And then in screaming headlines
Extra! Read all about it! Paper!
A singing whale?
- Whaddaya know ?
- Imagine that
Huh! I don't believe it
I don't believe it
For who ever heard of an operatic whale?
I don't believe it
I don't believe it
And headline followed headline
Then doctors and experts
And men of anatomical biology
Debated and argued
And quoted ichthyology
Impossible! Preposterous!
We savagely deny it
Magnificent! Miraculous!
We certainly certify it
And even the great impresario
Of the Grand Opera
Raised an eyebrow
And tried and tried to figure it out
This whale, she's maybe swallowed an opera singer.
That's it! This whale, she's a-swallowed an opera singer!
I find-a the great Signor Donatelli in-a the fish market.
I discovered the great Lilli Garli in-a the honky-tonky.
Why not I find-a the opera singer in-a the belly of a whale, huh?
I do it!
Oh, get me a great big schooner and get me a good harpooner
Photographers and reporters from all the newspapers
Publicity! Publicity!
Publicity!
Publicity, yes. But to Whitey the seagull, it was opportunity - the big opportunity for his friend Willie the whale.
There was no time to lose.
He must bring these two together.
Well, there was Tetti-Tatti now.
And Tetti-Tatti was in for a wonderful surprise.
Because Willie hadn't swallowed any opera singer, he could really sing.
Listen.
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin', shortnin'
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin' bread
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin', shortnin'
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin' bread
Two little chillun, lyin' in bed
One of 'em sick and the other 'most dead
Called for the doctor, the doctor said
"Feed them chillun on shortnin' bread"
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin', shortnin'
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin' bread
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin', shortnin'
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin' bread
After all these years of casting his "Shortnin' Bread" upon the waters, now at last success lay just over the waves.
Willie! Willie, look!
That's you, Willie!
He's looking for you!
It's your big opportunity.
Willie's going to be a great star.
Our Willie, going to sing grand opera.
Goodbye, my friends.
I'm off to be discovered
I'm off to be discovered
At last, the long years of patient waiting, the endless hours of faithful practice were about to be rewarded.
As Willie sped to his audition he wondered what to sing for his opening number.
What would impress this impresario?
How about a bit of Figaro?
Yes, sure, Figaro.
There she's blows! There she's blows!
Figaro.
Figaro!
Figaro!
Figaro! Figaro! Figaro!
Figaro! Figaro! Figaro! Figaro!
Figaro! Figaro! Figaro! Figaro!
Figaro!
Shoot-a de whale!
Figaro!
Figaro!
Figaro!
Hurry up, hurry up!
Rescue the opera singer!
Don't-a worry, we'll a-save you!
Bravo!
Bravissimo! Bravo!
Ah, but they hadn't heard the half of it.
They hadn't even heard a third of it.
For Willie was no ordinary singing whale.
Willie could sing in three separate voices: tenor... baritone... and bass.
Why, Willie was a singing miracle.
Let-a me up! This is the mutiny!
Mamma mia!
He's-a swallowed two opera singers!
He's-a swallowed three opera singers!
Stubborn, deluded Tetti-Tatti.
For right before his very eyes was the biggest discovery in all musical history.
Just imagine, a whale singing opera on the very stage of the Met.
Bravo! Bravissimo!
Je suis Méphisto
Roi d'enfer
Je veux...
Ta vie
I got him! I got him!
Vittoria!
Now Willie will never sing at the Met.
But don't be too harsh on Tetti-Tatti.
He just didn't understand.
You see, Willie's singing was a miracle, and people aren't used to miracles.
And you, faithful little friend, don't be too sad.
Because miracles never really die, and somewhere in whatever heaven is reserved for creatures of the deep,
Willie is still singing - in a hundred voices, each more golden than before.
And he'll go on singing, amid the applause and the cheering, forever.

Long, long ago,
in a faraway land across the sea,
there lived a little boy
who considered himself
quite an authority on brave,
fearless knights.
And their mortal enemies,
those horrible fire-breathing dragons
that daily terrorize the countryside.
One afternoon as the boy sat
deeply engrossed in his favourite su...
- Good afternoon, Father.
- Oh, son, I seen it.
Up on the bounds it was, all covered with scales and such.
And a tail with a sort of a hook on it.
Now wait until I catch my breath.
It's horrible. That's what it is, horrible.
It's only a dragon, Father.
Only a dragon?!
Oh, the village!
Help! There's a dragon coming! Help!
Don't worry, Father.
I'll have a look at him.
Hello, Dragon.
Oh, now, boy. Don't you throw stones at me or squirt water or anything
I won't have it.
Oh, I just came for a friendly chat.
But if I'm not wanted...
Oh, well, do be seated.
- Well, thank you.
- But if you don't mind...
...the other way, please?
I'll only be a minute.
Have you had any nice battles lately?
Battle?
Oh, no, no. No battles. No.
Oh, probably too busy scourging our countryside and devouring fair damsels, then.
Scourging, devouring?
Good heavens, no.
But don't you ever do anything desperate?
Well, yes, I...
I do make up poetry.
Poetry?
Verses, you know.
Care to hear my latest sonnet?
- Well, I...
- Oh, you'll love this.
I call it "Just A-Drifting."
Just a-drifting o'er the leaves
Like a dewdrop, fancy-free
Playing with the gentle breezes
Romping with the bumblebeeses
Oh, what fun,
Joy never ceases
Just a-drifting
Very nice.
But you're in for trouble, you know.
- Trouble?
- My father's arousing the village.
And they'll be here with spears and things to exterminate you.
You're an enemy of the human race.
Oh, I haven't an enemy in the world.
Too nice to make them.
Prancing, dancing to and fro
Not too fast, not too slow
Where the early birds are seeking
Early worms are slyly peeking
Hear the night owls softly squeaking
Just a-drifting
Hey, what's all the excitement?
It's Sir Giles, stupid.
Sir Giles?
Hooray for Sir Giles.
Hooray for Sir Giles.
Hooray for the dragon-killer.
Hooray for the dra...
Dragon-killer.
Oh, gosh.
It's all out, Dragon.
He's coming.
- He's here now.
- Now, boy.
It's impolite to interrupt a person.
- Who's coming?
- Sir Giles.
On a big horse with a long sword and spear.
You'll have to fight him.
Oh, I never fight. I never did.
- Doesn't agree with me.
- But... But... But...
Now, boy, now, boy. Just run along.
Tell Sir Giles to go home.
I'm sure you can arrange it.
Toodle-loo.
All right, now. All right, off you go.
Sir Giles can't be disturbed.
Sure, he's in conference, he is.
There ain't no one, absolutely no one, can see Sir Giles.
Now off you go. Off you go.
Away with you.
Excuse me, sir. I've come to...
Sir Giles, I presume?
Come, come, come, lad.
Stop mumbling.
- I came to talk about the Dragon.
- Oh, yes, yes, yes.
Another tale of woe and misery,
I suppose.
Devoured your flocks, no doubt.
Oh, no, sir. He...
Made off with your loving parents, has he?
Well, they shall be avenged.
- You don't understand.
- What?
Don't tell me he's kidnapped some fair damsel.
With flaxen hair and ruby lips and form divine.
Why, he can't do that to her.
He shall pay dearly on the field of battle.
But that's just it. He won't fight.
Yes, he...
He won't fight?
Preposterous.
The fellow must be an infernal cad.
Bit of a rotter, what?
He is not. He's a nice old dragon who likes to write poetry.
Poetry?
Yes, you know, verses?
How jolly.
I'm a bit of a bard myself, you know.
- You a poet too?
- Yes.
No doubt you heard of my "Ode to a Fleecy Cloud"?
- Well, I...
- Oh, fleecy cloud
O cloud of fleece
Up in the sky so high
Oh, my.
Oh, my.
But come, come. Let's not dilly-dally.
We must meet this fine fellow at once.
Then you'll explain to the Dragon about the fight?
Yes, quite right. Quite right.
Of course, of course, of course.
Quite, quite, quite.
I'm the reluctant dragon
What ho!
Quite so
The very reluctant dragon
Oh, very, very
Don't you know
They call me the timid dragon
What rot!
I'm not!
I just won't fight
I'd rather play
- I know I shan't get hurt that way
- Hello, Dragon.
Oh, hello, boy.
I'm having a picnic.
- I brought a friend to explain about...
- Oh, well, well, splendid.
The more, the merrier. Now, boy, you sit here and your friend can sit there.
- Thank you.
- Now, let's see now.
Pickles, jam, muffins, tea. Oh, yes.
Here, do have a jam sandwich, sir...?
Sir...?
What did you say your friend's name was?
Oh, that's Sir Giles.
Sir Giles. Well, well.
Yes, you know, the dragon-killer.
Sir Giles, you better tell the Dragon, quick.
Oh, yes, of course.
Hey, you know,
I've been looking forward to meeting you.
The boy here tells me you're quite an accomplished poet.
- Oh, he did, really?
- Yes, yes, yes.
And if it's not too much bother,
I'd be pleased to hear you recite.
Oh, my dear, dear fellow, no bother.
No bother at all.
Would you care for a sandwich?
Thank you. Jam.
Here. Do have another sandwich and a piece of cake and a crumpet and a lolly and a spot of tea.
Thank you.
This... This is called
"To An Upside-down Cake".
Sweet little upside-down cake
Cares and woes, you've got them.
Poor little upside-down cake
Your top is on your bottom.
Alas, little upside-down cake
Your troubles never stop
Because, little upside-down cake
Your bottom's on your top
Bravo. Quite interesting. Extraordinary.
Now, Sir Giles. Tell the Dragon now.
Oh, yes, of course.
You know, I am a bit of a bard myself.
Really? Oh, how nice.
Yes, yes, yes. Quite, quite.
Radish so red
Radish so red
Plucked from the heart
Of your warm little bed
Sprinkled with salt
On the top of your head
Delicious
Oh, that's exquisite. Simply exquisite.
Yes, of course. You're quite right.
Do you mind if I recite a poem?
You, boy? Why... Oh, not at all.
Oh, of course, of course.
Rather, rather.
'Tis evening
From the stars above
A soft mysterious light
Brings thoughts of friendship
Joy and love
Now how about that fight?!
Splendid. Quite.
Fight? Fight?
There's nothing to fight about.
Besides, I don't believe in it.
But dragons and knights always fight.
- That's right, by Jove.
- You can't disappoint the whole village.
- Not cricket, you know.
- Please, I...
I do not wish to discuss it further.
I refuse to listen.
I absolutely will not fight.
Good night.
Well, you know, it's a shame.
It doesn't seem right.
This is really a beautiful spot.
- For a fight.
- Yes, quite right.
Why, I can almost see it.
The flags are waving.
The people are cheering.
- Bands are playing.
- The Dragon appears.
What a beautiful sight, with his scales all agleam in the dawn's early light.
You're just flattering me.
Oh, no, fellow. It's true.
That beautiful damsel throws flowers at you.
- At me?
- At you.
As I ramp and I roar, I cut quite a figure.
Sir Giles has a spear just like this, only bigger.
I get set for the charge and...
Did you say spear?
Yes, spear.
Oh, dear.
No. I'll get hurt. I won't do it. Good day.
Just a second, old chap.
We might fix it this way.
You mean:
Quite so.
But are you sure it's quite honest?
Just a second, we'll look.
Nothing against it here in the book.
No, nothing against it here in the book.
If it looks like a battle,
I'm sure it's all right.
Very well, then, it's settled.
Tomorrow, we fight.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
There's going to be a fight
There's going to be a fight
A fight.
Boy. Sir Giles. Wait a minute.
Oh, wait, please.
Oh, why don't
I keep my big mouth shut?
So the next day, the villagers gathered
to see the valiant knight
engage the bloodthirsty Dragon
in a battle to the finish.
- So I am getting 20-to-1 on Sir Giles.
- That's twopence on the Dragon.
All right, on the Dragon.
Twopence on the Dragon.
You're a smart one.
Balloons. Only a bit for a balloon.
They're amusing, inexpensive.
A nice side seat and a nice side spot.
Here now, mind your step, lady.
Mind your step.
Look, the Dragon ain't got a chance.
Aye, he'll do the Dragon in.
Hooray, Sir Giles! Hooray!
It's no use.
You might as well tell the people to go away.
I can't do it.
- Oh, but try again.
- You've got to be mad to breathe fire.
But I'm not mad at anybody.
But try real hard. Concentrate.
Not very good, is it?
Nope. Too bad you're not a real dragon instead of a punk poet.
Punk poet?!
Oh, say that again.
- Punk poet.
- Again.
- Punk poet!
- Again.
Punk poet!
- Oh, I'm mad, I'm mad!
- Punk poet! Punk poet! Punk poet!
Punk poet!
Oh, again, again!
Punk poet!
By Jove.
Hooray for the Dragon!
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!
Dragon.
Dragon.
Extraordinary.
Why, he's disappeared.
- Here I am.
- Oh, so you are.
- Am I doing all right?
- I say, old boy.
Stop acting the silly ass, will you?
Help! Oh, no!
Oh, help!
- I say, you hack...!
- No, no stop it!
- Oh, no, stop! Stop it! Oh, no, you can't!
- That's it. Steady now.
- You can't do that!
- Raise the gate. Raise the gate. Hey.
No, no, no. No, fire.
It's horrible, ain't it?
- Oh, no!
- Help, please.
One lump or two? Help!
Don't mind if I do.
- Hey, you vulgar...!
- Help! Help!
Now I'll chase you.
- Help! Oh, no, no, no.
- Hey!
- Help!
- Steady now.
Hey, Sir Giles.
Egad.
Hooray, Sir Giles! Hooray!
Hooray, Dragon! Hooray!
Hooray, Sir Giles!
Hooray, Dragon!
Hooray, Sir Giles! Hooray, Dragon!
Hooray, Sir Giles! Hooray, Dragon!
Hooray, Sir Giles! Hooray, Dragon!
- Help!
- Take that!
- Horrible!
- Hey, cut it out! No, no, no.
- Help!
- Take that!
- Stop it. Oh, no.
- Stay the game.
The time has come, you know.
- You mean I die now?
- Oh, yes, indeed.
As per agreed, we'll seal our pact, old thing.
Take that!
- Hooray!
- Hooray for Sir Giles!
And so as per agreed,
Sir Giles completely reformed
this ferocious dragon,
whereupon the satisfied villagers
welcomed him into society.
Speech, speech, speech!
I promise not to rant or roar and scourge the countryside anymore.

We're three happy chappies with snappy serapes
You'll find us beneath our sombreros
We're brave and we'll stay so
We're bright as a peso
Who says so, we say so
We're Three Caballeros
Oh, through fair
Or stormy weather
We're always together
So let come what may
Like brother to brother we're all for each other
The Three Caballeros
Forever we'll stay
Oh!
"Felicitations to Donald Duck... on his birthday, Friday the 13th... from his friends in Latin America."
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!
What a pleasant surprise.
Whoops.
Ah, now, isn't that wonderful?
Which one should I open first?
My mama told me to take... this one!
I wonder what's in it.
Oh, boy! Home movies!
Just what I wanted.
Well, well, well.
Well, doggone.
A little penguin.
Oh. What a cute little fella.
Well, what is this?
How do you open this thing, anyway?
On with the show.
The show must go on.
Sí, señor.
That means "strange birds."
Oh, sure, sure.
I know: Birds.
Yes, amigo, your feathered cousins.
You know, Donald, you have more relatives here... than there are coffee beans in Brazil.
For instance, take the one who lives way, way down...
But suppose we let my friend
Professor Holloway tell us about it.
From the beginning to...
El fin, the end.
Yes. Thank you.
Professor?
This story takes us way down to the South Pole.
Rather than have you stand on your heads... let's turn the theater over.
There. That's better.
Two things you will find most of down here... are ice and penguins.
It's amazing that anybody would want to live here... but most penguins wouldn't live anywhere else.
You couldn't find better weather for fishing... skiing, tobogganing... or swimming.
And there is nothing the average penguin likes better... than a day at the beach.
Uh, but come on.
Let's meet Pablo.
He lives down at the end of Main Street.
Let's go in and see what's cookin'.
Pablo could never remember having been warm enough... and so his closest companion was SmokeyJoe... his little stove.
Between chills,
Pablo had one burning desire... to spend the rest of his life on some tropical shore.
So we see him bravely set forth for the isle of his dreams.
The other penguins turned out to give him a big send-off.
But when he gets just so far away from his stove...
See what happens?
Too bad.
Perhaps he'll give up this wild idea.
But no.
He's off to another start.
This time he's bringing a friend.
Anyway, it was a hot idea.
Well, maybe he'll be content to stay at home this time.
But no!
There he goes... hotfooting it to the land of the sun.
By now, the farewell committee has been reduced to two.
Discouraging, isn't it?
Suddenly,
Pablo got one of those ideas... that change a person's whole life: A boat.
But where would he get a boat?
Just watch.
Where there's a will, there's a way, they say.
And now, the official launching.
Day after day, the south wind carried him north.
One day, a blanket of fog rolled in... and it was so thick...
Must be near Cape Horn.
As the fog lifted... he found himself headed straight through the Straits of Magellan... and northward along Chile's rocky coast.
One day, a storm cloud came up... just a little bitty old storm cloud, though... and just tried awful hard to have its first storm.
Didn't amount to much, though.
One day on lookout,
Pablo had a bit of a shock... a waterspout off the port bow!
But it proved to be theJuan Fernandez Islands... where Robinson Crusoe once lived... and still does, apparently.
Four bells and all's well.
According to Pablo's chart, he should be nearing Vina Del Mar.
And strangely enough, that's just where he is.
He sailed past Lima, capital of Peru... hugging the coastline with a tenacity of purpose... seldom found in a penguin.
One day his telescope picked out a city... high up on top of a mountain.
The map said it was Quito... and it was right smack on the equator.
It wasn't as easy to cross... but with a little help from Neptune, he made it.
So, making a left turn, he followed the equator... headed for the Galapagos Islands.
Ah, that good old sun.
Pablo felt that he'd never get enough of it.
Oh, he hadn't counted on this.
Things looked pretty bad.
Help! Man the pumps!
She's sprung a leak!
Pipe all hands on deck!
Do things! Get going!
Take to the lifeboats!
Abandon ship!
Unruffle the mizzenmast and man the poops!
And, well, don't just stand there.
Get going!
Swab the decks, and...
Heavens.
Look! What's that?
Just what he's been looking for.
Pablo has finally reached the isle of his dreams.
And so, as the warm tropical sun... sinks slowly in the west... we leave little Pablo, a bird in paradise... a picture of health in his new coat of tan.
He should be the happiest penguin in the world.
Only sometimes... he gets to thinking...
Never satisfied.
Well, that's human nature for you... even if you're a penguin.
You're absolutely right.
And now, Donald, let's hop over the Andes.
From these snowcapped peaks to the depths of the Amazon jungle... one finds many more strange and exotic birds.
Like the anambepreto of Colombia and Venezuela.
He carries his own bagpipes hidden under his beard.
Then there's his cousin, the arapapa... pride of Paraguay, whose perfect appearance... permits his pompous pride in his pompadour.
And la tijereta, the scissors bird... the Colombian cutup.
Then there's the arapacu de pico curvo.
He's always sticking his nose into things.
Did you ever see such a freak beak, huh?
Speaking of beaks, what a time two toucans have making love.
When they're beak to beak, they can't get cheek to cheek.
Because when one toucan turns his head... only one toucan can.
Uh-oh. Who's that?
Oh, a thousand pardons.
Señor Donald, I would like to have you meet... one of the most eccentric birds you have ever seen.
His name is the aracuan.
You'll find him most everywhere.
Eh, glad to know ya.
Pleased to meet ya.
Now, he's called the aracuan... because of the peculiar song he sings... which sounds something like this.
By the way, amigo, did you know some birds are skilled craftsmen?
Uh-uh. Is that so?
Yes. Quite a builder is the little marrequito.
His nest may look haphazard in design... ah, but every single stick and straw... is scientifically placed to withstand... the stress and strain of... well, almost anything.
Literally dotted are the shores of many tropical marshes... with the brilliant plumage of the flamingo.
And now, Donald, how would you like to hear a story... about another bird so amazing you won't believe it?
Oh, sure. You bet.
It's a tale told by an old gaucho from Uruguay.
Listen.
It was early one morning in springtime... just as day was beginning to break.
As the sun came up over the...
Oh, but I am forgetting my story.
It was silent out there on the pampas.
Only one little bird was awake.
From his nest came the little hornero to see if the...
Oh, say, do you know why this bird's called the hornero?
- No?
- Uh-uh. Why?
You see, his nest is just like the horno.
That's the oven where we bake our bread and our...
Oh, oh, oh, you know who that is?
That's me, when I was a little gauchito.
Many, many years ago, of course.
And why was I up so early?
Because I was going out hunting all alone.
First I put on my bombachas and tied on my chiripá.
Then I slipped into my new botas.
And I put my boleadoras where I could reach them in a hurry.
¡Gauchito.!
Not forgetting my hunting knife.
And now I was ready to go.
Now, the best place to hunt the wild ostrich... is out on the wide open plains... on the broad, flat land of the...
Flat land?
Say, what am I doing here?
Oh, now I remember.
This day I was hunting for condor birds high up in the mountains.
While looking around for the condors,
I climbed to the top of a rock.
No, come to think of it, it was a tree.
Let's see, maybe it was a rock after all.
Although I could swear it was a tree.
Oh, what's the difference?
Let it go. Let it go.
My sharp eyes soon discovered the nest of a...
Psst! ¡Gauchito.!
The nest.
I could tell from the wings he was... he was a least five meters from tip to tip.
The biggest condor bird in all of... ¡Caramba.!
What's this?
I couldn't believe my eyes.
No, it couldn't be.
But there it was.
I was looking face to face with a flying donkey.
The donkey bird didn't seem bashful.
He flew right up close to...
Quick, Gauchito.!
Now! Get him, quick!
Aha. Got him.
Now, now. Easy, easy.
This donkey should be worth a fortune.
I couldn't let him get away.
So I made up my mind that I'd catch him if it took me the rest of...
Now I had him!
Hold him, Gauchito.!
Ride him, cowboy!
He acted just like he was loco, but I was an expert, of course.
He thought he could throw this gauchito... but he soon found out who was the boss.
Psst, Gauchito.!
Who is the boss?
I decided to train him for racing... far out where nobody could see...
'cause I planned to win thousands of pesos... for this little burrito and me.
I made brilliant plans for the future.
We'd live like a couple of kings... and I'd be the world's richest gaucho... with my hands full of big diamond rings.
¡Ah, macanudo.!
Okay.
This burrito was tame as a kitten.
He was learning new tricks every day.
You should see how he begged for my mate.
He liked it much better than hay.
Then we soon fell asleep by the campfire.
We both were as tired as could be... and tomorrow was very important... for little Burrito and me.
For this was the day of fiesta.
The gauchos were happy and gay.
They danced the zamba and gatos... and gambled their pesos away.
While the crowd sang and danced in the plaza...
I just stood in the shade of a tree...
and watched them toss coins at the sapo.
But this game meant nothing to me.
Some others were rolling the bochas and betting on games of this kind.
But I didn't join in these pastimes.
I had something bigger in mind.
- ¡Ay, caballo.!
- The race was about to begin... and the grand prize was 1,000 pesos.
The gauchos were howling with laughter... when they saw us come out on the track.
I whispered,
"Remember the wings, Burrito."
Oh-oh-oh-oh!
Not yet! Not yet!
The gauchos and horses were all on their toes.
We were off with the speed of a bullet.
We flew down the track like the wind.
Every gaucho was, uh, uh...
Meanwhile, Burrito and I were, uh, uh, jockeying for position.
¡Gauchito.!
They went that way.
That way.
No wonder they laughed.
I didn't even look like a jockey.
Hey, Gauchito.
Come on.
Look like a jockey.
Pepito, the pride of Mendoza, was setting a furious pace... and Fuego, Gordito and Pingo, you never have seen such a race.
Now it's Pepito and Fuego.
It's Fuego and Pepito.
And there comes Gordito on the rail.
Do your stuff, kid.
No?
Well, don't wait too long or...
Look out!
Ah-heh.
What did I tell you?
Come on, Gauchito.
The wings, the wings.
Quickly I untied the rope.
Come on, come on.
Quickly I untied the rope.
The knife! The knife!
¡Córtalo, córtalo.!
And now we go.
You should see little Burrito... tearing up the track, so fast you couldn't see us.
And now down the home stretch comes
Fuego. Now Pepito's ahead on the rail.
Here comes Pingo, Gordito and Gato, and Dorado is right on his tail.
But where is Burrito?
Here comes Burrito!
We passed them like they were standing still.
And now coming down across the line of finish, it's Burrito, the winner!
Well, amigos, it was all over but the shouting...
I thought.
Caramba.
The jig was up.
And what became of the flying donkey, you ask?
Neither him nor me was ever seen again... as long as we lived.
Adios, amigo.
Adios. So long!
Good-bye!
What's going on here?
Presents! Oh, boy!
Let me at 'em!
Say, what's this?
Ah, Pato Donald.
Or, as you Americans say, what's cookin'?
Joe Carioca!
Well, I'll be doggoned!
Imagine meeting me here.
Donald, have you ever been to Baía? No?
- No, I haven't.
- Ah, Baía.
Land of romance... moonlight, music, beautiful girls.
Oh, forgive the interruption,
Donald.
This crazy bird is the aracuan.
He's meio maluco, a very stupid fellow.
But tell me, Donald, have you ever been to Baía?
- No, I haven't.
- No? Oh...
I am so sorry for you.
Ah, Baía.
It is like a song in my heart.
A song with love... and beautiful memories.
I close my eyes, and I can see it now.
I can see the beautiful twilight in the sky.
I can feel the breeze from the bay... and I can hear the music, the music of Baía.
When twilight is deep in the sky
Someone that I long to see
Keeps haunting my reverie
And so the loneliness deep in my heart
Calls to you
Calls to you
I live in the memory of
Many dreams ago
When the stars were bright
And you were mine alone
My love for you cannot die
Though the oceans run dry
Or heaven falls from the sky
Now you're gone
Can't you hear my lonely call
Morena
Make my life complete again
How I pray for the day
When I'll see your smile
And my heart will beat again
When twilight is deep in the sky
Someone that I long to see
Keeps haunting my reverie
And so the loneliness deep in my heart
Calls to you, calls to you
Ah, Baía.
Beautiful Baía.
Oh, forgive me, but have you been to Baía, Donald?
- No.
- No? Well, let's go.
If you go to Baía, my friend... you'll never return.
Have you been to Baía, Donald
- Uh-uh.
- Well, let's go
- They have vatapá
- What's that?
- They have caruru
- Is that so?
- They have munguzá
- Munguzá?
- Do you like to samba
- Oh, sure.
- Have you been to Baía, Donald
- No.
Well, let's go
When you go to Baía, my friend
You'll never return
Have you been to Baía?
- No.
- No? Well, let's go!
Hurry, Donald! Hurry!
Well, well. Here we are in Baía, land of romance.
Baía? Where is Baía?
We are in Baía.
Look.
Well, I'll be doggoned.
- Who's that?
- Donald, that's Yayá.
- Who's Yayá?
- Ah, a baiana.
Donald, quindins de Yayá.
She sells cookies.
Cookies, my friend.
Donald!
- Hello.
- i Como vai!
Hi, toots.
What?
- Who is that guy?
- Oh, he's a malandro, Donald.
Oh, boy!
This Donald!
Did you ever see such a fast worker?
No, no, Donald.
Take it easy.
Look.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!
Come on, boys.
What do you feel about Baía, huh?
Tell me the truth.
Oh, swell! Marvelous!
Romance.
Moonlight.
Beautiful girls.
Or as you say, you are a wolf.
Take it easy.
You have more presents.
Presents?
Whee! Presents!
What? Oh! Oh!
Oh, I'm a midget!
Oh!
You, you're a midget too!
Oh-ho, Donald!
Don't worry.
It is simple, my friend.
Just a little black magic will fix you up.
Believe it or not, it is very simple!
You are very funny fellow!
Oh, my, my, my, my, my, my!
You kill my head!
- Huh?
- Oh, my friend... you are using the wrong finger.
Now, blow!
- Thanks, pal!
- B-B-B-But, Donald, your presents!
My presents!
Aha, my friends!
Welcome to Mexico.
Son of a gun, it's a pleasure to see such fine gentlemen in Mexico.
Here, amigos.
Donald!
José.
¡Caramba.!
Now we're three gay caballeros.
We're three caballeros
Three gay caballeros
They say we are birds of a feather
We're happy amigos
No matter where he goes
The one, two and three goes
We're always together
We're three happy chappies with snappy serapes
You'll find us beneath our sombreros
We're brave and we'll stay so
We're bright as a peso
- Who says so?
- We say so
The Three Caballeros
We have the stars to guide us
Guitars here beside us
To play as we go
We sing and we samba
We shout, Ay, caramba
- What means "ay, caramba"?
- Oh, yes. I don't know.
Through fair or stormy weather
We stand close together
Like books on a shelf
And pals though we may be
When some Latin baby says yes, no, or maybe
Each man is for himself
- What's this?
- What's this?
This is your gift from Mexico, Donald:
A piñata.
Oh, boy, oh, boy! A piñata!
What's a piñata?
A piñata is full of surprises, presents.
It is the very spirit of Christmas.
Christmas?
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all...
No, no, Donald.
For goodness sake.
Not "Jingly Bells."
In Mexico, they sing
"Las Posadas."
This custom takes place on each of the nine days before Christmas.
Each evening, the children gather at the village church... and form a procession symbolizing the journey of Mary and Joseph... from Nazareth to Bethlehem.
The little ones carry images of the saints from house to house...
singing a plea for shelter, or posada.
A reply comes from within:
"No posada. No shelter."
Looking sad and downhearted, they try again... but the reply is still the same.
"No shelter. No posada."
They repeat this song time after time... and always they are refused.
Until at last they reach a friendly house and the door is opened.
"Come in, come in, holy pilgrims.
This humble home is yours."
And now, Mary and Joseph have found shelter at last.
Then the rejoicing begins... the feasting, the celebrating... and finally the biggest surprise of all:
Breaking the piñata.
And now for your piñata, Donald.
Here you are.
Go to it.
One side, boys. One side.
I'm gonna smack it!
Uh-uh, no, hold it.
Ho-Hold it, Donald.
First you must be blindfolded.
We have to put this over your eyes.
That's part of the tradition.
Now, now, now, stand here.
Come here now.
Hit it hard.
All right, let's see you smack it.
Just a minute.
Uh-oh. Aha!
You see, Donald? Didn't I told you it was full of surprises?
Did you know that the history of Mexico is in her flag?
Oh, yes! You see, many hundreds of years ago, the god of the Aztecs... commanded them to build a big city where they would find an eagle destroying a serpent.
But when they find this eagle, he was sitting on a cactus on top of a rock... way out in the middle of a lake.
¡Caramba.! To build a city here would be almost imposible.
But they built and built and built some more... until today, believe it or not, the lake is full of Mexico City.
Sweet music
Gay serenatas
Tropic skies
Of velvet blue
Magic gardens
Perfume the breezes
Where true love
Brought me to you
Mexico
With all your romance
Your song oflove
Will live forever after
Mexico
Sweethearts are singing
Lovebirds are winging
Through a sky filled with laughter
Paradise
That's where I found you
Your magic smile
Made the blossoms bloom around you
Mexico
Why do I feel as I do
I simply fell
Under the spell
Of you
- ¡Oba.! ¡Oba.! Nice! Oh, boy!
- Wow!
Ah, but this is only the beginning, amigos. Take a look at this one.
Oh, boy!
What a pretty picture!
And now, for a nice little trip through Mexico... on the magic serape.
- All aboard, amigos.
- Oh, what's goin' on here?
Paradise
That's where I found you
Your magic smile
Made the blossoms bloom around you
Mexico
Why do I feel as I do
I simply fell
Under the spell
Of you
Of you
And this, Donald, is Patzcuaro... a fisherman's paradise.
Yeah! Beautiful!
Oh, boy! Would I like to come back sometime... and do a little fishing.
Uh-oh!
- What's going on here?
- Shh!
This is my favorite dance, the "jarabe pateño."
Doggone it!
I can't get it.
No-no-no-no-no-no-no, boys!
You are off the beat.
This is the way.
Well, what do you know?
Thanks.
I had a wonderful time.
So long!
This is the way they dance in Veracruz.
It's called the "lilongo."
Hi, girls!
May I cut in?
Watch your step, Donald!
Some fun, hey, kid?
So you like dancing, huh?
- Okay.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Go on, Donald.
Don't be afraid.
Not so fast, boys.
Go on in, Donald.
Don't be bashful.
Hi, toots!
Am I intruding?
Hey, Donald, you are what they say, off the cob!
- You know, corny.
- Oh, yeah?
Swing me with that boogie beat, Joe!
How am I doin', toots?
Come on, let me down.
- I wanna stay!
- Take it easy, Donald.
There she is...
Acapulco Beach... the Riviera of Mexico.
Take the telescope and have a look at what you might call the hot stuff.
Oh, boy! Am I going to like this place.
Oh, boy! Hot stuff!
I'll be right down, toots.
- Hello, my sweet little bathing beauties.
- Donald! Donald!
We're three caballeros
Three gay caballeros
They say we are birds of a feather
Where's Donald?
Aha! I am a son of a gun. Look at the little wolf in duck's clothings.
Come to Papa.
Wha-What's going on here?
Come here, you little rascals.
Now I've got ya. Uh-oh.
Doggone this confusion!
Oops! Where is she?
Come here, my little enchilada.
I've got you this time, tootsie.
Peek-a-boo.
I see you.
Hey, where am I?
My, my, my!
Ain't this fun?
Here I come!
This time I'm gonna get you!
Oh, no, no, no, Donald!
Don't do that!
Let me go. Get me outta here!
You can't do this to me.
Get your hands off of me!
This is a free country.
Bye-bye!
So you like pretty girls, huh?
Let's go!
- Let me go!
- Don't ruffle your feathers, Donald!
Look, I will show you the nightlife of Mexico City.
- Beautiful, no?
- Colossal!
Oh, boy! Mexico City?
Very beautiful city.
Careful, Donald.
Even the sky is full of romantic!
You belong to my heart
- She's beautiful!
- Now and forever
- And our love had its start
- Oh, boy!
Not long ago
We were gathering stars
While a million guitars played our love song
When I said "I love you" every beat of my heart
- Oh, boy, oh, boy.
- Said it too
'Twas a moment like this
Do you remember
And your eyes threw a kiss
When they met mine
Now we own all the stars
And a million guitars are still playing
Darling, you are the song
And you'll always belong to my heart
'Twas a moment like this
- Do you remember
- Uh-huh.
And your eyes threw a kiss
- When they met mine
- Don't do that!
Now we own all the stars
And a million guitars are still playing
Darling, you are the song
And you'll always belong to my heart
You belong
To my heart
Now and forever
Three caballeros
Three gay caballeros
Three caballeros
Three gay caballeros
When I said "I love you"
Every beat of my heart said it too
- Some fun, hey, kid?
- Some fun, hey, kid?
Some fun, hey, kid?
We're three caballeros
Three gay caballeros
They say we are birds of a feather
We're happy amigos
No matter where he goes
The one, two and three goes
We're always together
Darling, you are the song
And you'll always belong to my heart
Pretty girls. Pretty girls.
Pretty girls. Pretty girls.
What? Oh, boy!
Uh-oh.
Uh, what's happening, anyway?
Where am I?
Uh-oh!
My, my!
Uh-oh.
What?
What?
What?
Come on, torito, give it to me!
What's the matter with you?
Are you color-blind?
Come on, bull. You bashful?
Oh, through fair or stormy weather
We're always together
So let come what may
Like brother to brother we're all for each other
The Three Caballeros
Forever we'll
Stay

On the pages ofAmerican folklore, a legion ofmighty men have left the symbols oftheir greatness,
There was Paul Bunyan ´s ax;
John Henry´s hammer;
Davy Crockett´s rifle; and then, quite unexpectedly, one comes upon a tin pot hat, a bag ofapple seed,,, and a holy book,
And strangely enough, these are the symbols of one ofthe mightiest men ofall--
John Chapman, a real-life pioneer,
With the passingyears, however, reality has given way to legend, until today we know this remarkable man simply as Johnny Appleseed,
This is his story, told by an old settler who knewJohnny well,
Listen,
[ Old Settler Narrating ] Well, sir, every time I see an apple blossom sky,,,
I think ofJohnny Appleseed,
´cause, of course, them clouds up thar, they ain ´t really clouds at all,
No, sir,
Why, shucks, there wouldn ´t be no apple blossom sky,,, ifit weren ´t for the fact thatJohnny--
But now, hold on here, Guess I´d better start back to the beginnin ´,
That´s when Johnny lived on a farm near Pittsburgh town,
The year was 1 806, or maybe there around,
Now,just to look at him you´d sayJohnny Appleseed never would make a pioneer,
- ## [ Whistl i ng ]
- He was such a sawed-off, scrawny little fella,
´Course that didn´t faze Johnny none,
Shucks, he had his apple trees and the morning sun and the evening breeze,

PoorJohnny,
He weren´t no pioneer, and he knowed it,
It was alljust pretend, and them folks goin´ west to build this nation,,, sure made pickin´apples look like a plumb useless occupation,
- ## [ Fades ]
- Well, sir, that´s when a miracle happened,
""Well, what´s holdin ´ya,Johnny?, "" says a voice,
""Go on, Go on out west, ifthat´s your choice, ""
Well, sir, it was an angel,
Johnny´s own private guardian angel,
Might look mighty queersome to you and me, but, you know, that´s just the way
John figured he ´d be,
Wel l,  speak up,  boy.
Don´t stand there gawki n´.
U nlock your jaw and get to talkin´.
Y-Y-Yes,  sir--
Yes,  sir!.
Why don´t I go west?.
´Cause I ain´t got the muscle... nor the breadth ofchest,
Out tharit´s the strong men who survive, and I´m about the puniest feller alive.
Shame to ya, Johnny.
You got faith and courage and a level head.
But,  shucks, you see,  sir, all I know is... apple trees.
And what´s wrong with apples, ifyou please?.
Ain´t they ´bout the finest fruit in all the land?.
Why,  shoot,  man, they take the cake.
Just think, Johnny, of all the things that apples make.
There´s,  uh, apple pickles.
# Oh-so-tastyapple tarts andapple pastry#
# Apple dumplings
Not to mention-- #
- Applesauce?.
- Yes!
# And there´s apple fritters light as thistle #
# And for folks to wet their whistle #

# Oh,  there´s a lot ofwork to do ##
[OldSettler]
Well, sir, that´s howit all began,
That´s howJohnny, all alone, set out to meet the great unknown,
´Twas a mighty big and fearsome place,,, for a man to face,
A little man, and all alone, without no knife, without no gun,
And though the forest is dark and wide,,, with fearsome critters on every side,
Johnnyjust kept walkin ´ on,
Walked until at last he found a little spot of open ground,,, with fertile soil and warmsome breeze, a likely place for apple trees,
Now, the varmints here, they couldn ´t know,,, ifJohn was friend orJohn was foe, so some took off in sudden flight,,, and some got set to claw and bite,
But ifJohnny seen ´em he paid no heed,
Just got busy a-plantin´apple seeds,
## [ Whistl i ng ]
## [ Conti nues ]
Now, them varmints come from everywhere,,, to watch that man a-diggin´ there,
Didn´t like what they was seein´,
Didn´t trust no human bein´,
## [ Conti nues ]
Yep, that ornery human had to go,
But who was a-gonna tell him so?,
Well, not a soul could answer that,,, till here come along a black-and-white cat,
Now, he weren´t too bright, but he didn´t much care,
He knowed he had a certain ai r... about him,
## [ Whistling Continues ]
[ Sniffi ng ]
## [ Continues ]
Well, sir, that done it,
The critters ne´er seed the beat ofthat, the likes ofa human a-likin´ that cat,
Why, shucks, this little man had went and busted every precedent,
He was the very first to come,,, without no knife, without no gun,
And so it was, from that time on, every last livin ´ varmint was a friend to John,
- ## [ Conti nues ]
- They surely was,
# The Lord is good to me #
# And so I thank the Lord #
# For givin´me the things I need#
# The sun and rain and an apple seed#
# Yes, He´s been good to me ##
Well, as time went byJohnny kept right on a-plantin´his apple trees,,, and makin´ friends everywhere, and his best friends was the pioneers,,, for, of course,John was plantin´more than an apple tree,
He was plantin´his own boundless faith and courage too, and that give folks new heart, new hope in the job they had to do,
As more and more pioneers come to push back the forest, the kindly deeds oflittle Johnny Appleseed,,, spread throughout the land, and more ´n once, with a good old-fashionedjubilee, folks would honorJohnny Appleseed and the fruit ofthe apple tree,

[ Old Settler] Yup,Johnny did bring folks a heap ofhappiness,
But, shucks, he weren´t lookin´ for thanks,
Didn´t have time fer it,
He knowed a man can´t take no rest,,, ifhe aims to plant the whole darn wilderness in apple trees,
And so it was-- for more´n 40 year,,,
John walked and planted that old frontier,
[ Thunderclap ]
Yes, sir, 40 years of walkin ´ and plantin ´,
And in that space oftwoscore year,,, this little man, he throwed his shadow clear across the land, across 1 00, 000 miles square,
And in that shadow everywhere,,, you´ll find he left his blessin ´s three:

There´s poetry in trees, they say, and, well, one day a poet found it,
Then a music master wove around it,,, melody,
An artist touched it, gave it form in colors rich and warm,
And now we bring to you these three:. poem, picture, melody,
A simple tribute to a tree,

# A poem lovely as a tree #
# A tree whose hungry mouth #

# At God#
# All day #
# And lifts her leafy arms #

Uncle Roy.
- Yes,  honey?.
- What makes the wolves howl like that?.
Wolves?. Ha!
Those are coyotes.
-Aren´t they, Roy?
- Yep,  they´re coyotes. Bobby´s right.
- They always howl when the moon is bright.
- Why?.
Well, that´s quite a story,
- Cowboys in it?.
- Yes, sirree,
- I njuns too?.
- Well,  could throw in maybe two or three.
But mostly this story is about Pecos Bill.
- Pecos Bill?. Who´s he?.
-## [ Guitar: Sharp Strum ]
- What?. Never heard of Pecos Bill?.
- Imagine that.
Why,  I thought everybody knowed Pecos.
Why,  Bobby, 
I´m surprised at you.
Bill was the world´s greatest buckaroo.
# He was the roughest, toughest critter
Never known to be a quitter #
# ´Cause he never had no fear for man nor beast #
- Yep,  that there Pecos Bill was--
- [ Whinnying ]
Easy,  Trigger.
I´m not forgettin´ Bill´s horse.
Why,  shucks, 
I couldn´t forget Widowmaker.
- Widowmaker?.
- [ Laughs ] That´s a funny name.
But that horse earnedit just the same,
- He was a killer.
- Dynamite on the hoof.
Yep,  Widowmaker was Bill´s best pal, until along came that beautiful prairie gal.
[ Whinnying ]
- Aw,  shucks. A woman in the story.
- But what a woman.
# She was fresh as the dew#
# On a prairie rose #
# A true thoroughbred #
# From her head to her toes #
#That there was Slewfoot Sue #
# Sweet Sue #
Slewfoot Sue. Huh!
I´d rather hear about the coyotes.
Yes,  Uncle Roy, you started to say--
Why the coyotes howl at the moon that way?.
You´re right,  honey, but it all fits together.
Can´t tell one without the other, because the story of Bill and that Slewfoot gal... is the story of coyotes and why they howl.
I´m gettin´ down to the details right now.
Now,  here on the map ofthe old U.S., completely surrounded bywilderness,  lies Texas.
-[Cowboy] Amen,
- ´Course,  there´s some other states scattered around.
- Yeah, like Wyoming,
- Milwaukee,
-And Long Island Sound,
- Right,

Down Texas way a river flows,
Where it comes from, nobody knows,
Where it´s a-goin´ don´t no one care,
Just doggone glad it´s a-leavin´ there,
- That there´s the Pecos River,
- She was pure alkali,
Just naturally mean water,
Why, the buzzards won ´t even touch it,
-## [ Whistling ]
- Into this fertile garden spot,,, once there come a prairie cart,

- There was Ma and Pa and 1 6 brats, four hound dogs--

[ Roy Rogers ]All a-goin´ west, lookin´ for elbow room,
Sure could use some ofthe same,
Crossin´ the Pecos River bed, somethin´ fell out and lit on his head,
Folks didn´t even know he was gone,
Ol´ wagon just kept a-rollin´along,
Yep, it was Bill,
Poor little critter,
Homeless as a poker chip,
# ´Long came night and a prairie moon #
# Old Ma Coyote a-hurryin ´ home #
# She was due for a shock at herjourney´s end#
# Fer the stork had delivered a dividend#
Plumb unusual!

# Bill looked up and then he grinned#
Shucks!
# Ma´s ol´heart just plumb caved in #
# Bill seen right off that he needn´t fear #
# He´d staked himself a claim right here #
Headed straight for that old chuck wagon,
Yep, ol´ Bill was hungrier than a woodpecker with a headache,
And so it follered as a natural fact,,,
- that Bill growed up with that coyote pack,
- [ Growls ]
He soon become the main top hand,,, in a way they all could understand,
[ Yel I i ng ]
But little Bill, he couldn´t rest,,, till he´d proved hisself the A- 1 best,
So he studied the other varmints too, then showed ´em all a trick or two,
Outloped the antelope,
Outjumped the jackrabbit,
[ Rattl i ng ]
[ H issi ng ]

[ Yel I i ng ]
Well, it was the beginning ofa beautiful friendship,
From that time on them two stuck together,,,
Iike warts on a toad, like birds ofa feather,
When Bill growed up, it was natural, of course-- he ´d choose a career to suit him and his horse,
Yep, Bill become a rootin ´, tootin ´ cowboy,

- Yep, them was happy days fer Bill and that hoss,
- [ Gunshots ]
Looked like nothin´ could ever come between ´em,
Then it happened,
Now, Bill was happy that fateful day, a-killin´some time in his carefree way, inventin´a one-man rodeo,,, a-buttin´heads with the buffalo,
Poor Bill,
Yeah, happy as a hog in a turnip patch,
And then old man Fate started dealin´ from the bottom ofthe deck, for down the stream come Slewfoot Sue,,, with all her charms revealed to view,
Looked like somethin´ from out´n a dream-- first female woman
Bill´s ever seen,
## [ WolfWhistle ]
- She was strange,
- Unusual,
Yeah, but powerful stimulatin´,
Like a slug ofrye on an empty stomach,
# Give ´im a right peculiar feelin´#
# Set his senses plumb to reelin´#
-# With a poundin´sound inside his ears #
- [ Stampeding Hoofbeats ]
# Like the gallopin´hooves ofa thousand steers #
# Inside his chest was a-seethin´and churnin´#
# His blood was a-boilin´
His brain was a-burnin´#
# A-burnin´ with the fires that could only be cooled#
# In the beckoning depths #
# Oftwo blue, limpid pools #
Yep, I ´amour had come to Pecos Bill,
[ Barki ng,  Howl i ng ]
Yahoo!
Widowmaker was plumb puzzled,
Looked like trouble to him, and he sure was right,
Bill was busy inventin´ courtin´, western-style,
# He arranged for the moon #
# To rise just right #
# And flood the land#
# With a silvery light #
# Ordered the stars #
# In heaven above #
# To form a token #
# Ofundying love #
# Then, ´cross the sky #
# In words offire #
# Bill told sweet Sue #
# Ofhis own heart´s #
# Desire #
# Sweet Sue #
# I love #
- [ Kissi ng Sound ]
-# You ##
And so Sue named the wedding day, but there was a price
Bill had to pay,
Sue wanted a bustle-- the finest, of course-- and she aimed to be wedded a-ridin´ Bill´s horse,
Well, Sue got her bustle and it sure was classy,
Put the finishin ´ touch on that sweet gal´s chassis,
Why, that there happy, blushin ´ bride,,, was a-bustin ´ out with girlish pride,
## [ Wolf Whistles ]
But Bill had promised Slewfoot Sue a ride on Widowmaker too,
[ Gul p ]
- Would that horse be willin´ to let Sue ride?
- [ Whinnying ]
Well, here comes the answer-- fit to be tied,
Widowmaker was plumb irritated,
But it didn ´t bother Sue none,
She walked right up to that critter´s side,
Her gentle hand touched his bristlin ´ hide,
Her foot found the stirrup, With a flick ofher bustle, Sue was aboard,
- And sought for the tussle,
- [ Yawns ]
The proceedin ´s begun to commence,,, forthwith,
[ Widowmaker Whi nnyi ng ]
No doubt about it.
That there Sue was a regular female buckaroo.
[ Whinnying Continues ]
And then, that bustle--
Underneath them frills and flounces,
Sue was developin´ plenty ofbounces,
Got to be more´n that gal could handle, and Sue took off like a Roman candle,
That devilish contraption ofsteel and wire,,, kept bouncin´ that poor gal higher and higher,
Soon it was plain to the multitude,,, that Sue was a-gainin´altitude,
Sure looked like she was a goner,
But no,
Here come a ray ofhope,
Look! I t were Bi I l and his trusty rope.
He´d durn soon put a stop to this,
- Shucks, Bill was never knowed to miss,
- [ Crash ]
Bill was calm, confident,
He built his loop with careless ease,
He judged his distance, tested the breeze,
Then a whirl and a twirl and a twist ofthe wrist,
He let ´er go,,, but the champeen missed,
How it come to happen, nobody could ever figure out,
## [ Whistl i ng ]
She was offagain on her heavenly flight,
Up, up she went, clean out ofsight, till far into space this unfortunate maid,,, finally come to the moon, and that´s where she stayed,
In the state ofTexas,
U,S,A,,
Iife still goes on in the same old way,,, and the Pecos River still flows on, but the greatest cowboy on Earth,,, is gone,
Yeah, Bill went back to the coyotes, but he never forgot Sue,
And every night, when the moon ris´high, he´d lift his voice in mournful cry,
- [ Howl i ng ]
- Bewailin´ the fate ofhis lady fair, his long lost love in the sky up there,
- [ Howling Continues ]
- So painful was his griefto see, the varmints joined in out ofsympathy,
And that´s how come, to this very day, coyotes howl at the moon that way,
- # Move along #
- # Move along #
# Bl ue shadows #
- # Move along #
- # Move along,  move along,  move along #
# Soon the dawn will come #
# And you´ll be on yourway #
# On yourway #
# But until #
#The darkness #
# Sheds its veil #
#There´ll be blue shadows #
# On the trail #
# Shadows on #
#The trail ##

Love is a song that never ends

If you can't say something nice... don't say nothing at all.

Purty! Purty flower!
Oh... gosh.
I think I better go home now.

Mother, what we going to do today?
I'm going to take you to the meadow.
Meadow? What's the meadow?
It's a very wonderful place.
Then why haven't we been there before?
You weren't big enough.
- Mother, you know what?
- What?
We're not the only deer in the forest.
- Where did you hear that?
- Thumper told me.
Well, he's right.
There are many deer in the forest besides us.
Then why don't I ever see them?
- You will, sometime.
- On the meadow?
Perhaps.
Hush now.
We're almost there.
- The meadow!
- Wait!
Bambi, wait!
You must never rush out on the meadow.
There might be danger.
Out there, we're unprotected.
The meadow is wide and open, and there are no trees or bushes to hide us.
So we have to be very careful.
Wait here.
I'll go out first. And if the meadow is safe, I'll call you.
Come on, Bambi. It's all right.
Come on.
Good morning, Prince Bambi.
Good morning, young prince.
Hello. What ya eatin'?
- Clover.
- It's awfully good.
It's delicious.
Why don't you try some?
No, no, not that green stuff.
Just eat the blossoms.
That's the good stuff.
Thumper.
- Yes, Mama?
- What did your father tell you?
About what?
About eating the blossoms and leaving the greens?
Oh, that one.
Eating greens is a special treat.
It makes long ears and great big feet.
But it sure is awful stuff to eat.
I made that last part up myself.
Watch out.
Watch out.
That's little Faline.
He's kind of bashful, isn't he, Mama?
Well, maybe he wouldn't be if you'd say hello.
Hello, Bambi.
I said hello.
Well, aren't you going to answer her?
You're not afraid, are you?
Well, then, go ahead.
Go on, say hello.
Hello.
You!
He stopped and looked at me.
Yes, I know.
Why was everyone still when he came on the meadow?
Everyone respects him.
For of all the deer in the forest, not one has lived half so long.
He's very brave and very wise.
That's why he's known as the
Great Prince of the Forest.
Faline!
Bambi!
Mother!
Bambi!
Bambi!
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!
Come on out, Bambi.
Come on.
It's safe now.
We don't have to hide any longer.
What happened, Mother?
Why did we all run?
Man... was in the forest.
Mother, look! What's all that white stuff?
Why, it's snow.
- Snow?
- Yes.
Winter has come.
Hiya, Bambi.
Watch what I can do.
Whoo!
Come on! It's all right!
Look!
The water's stiff.
Yippee!
Some fun, huh, Bambi?
Come on, get up. Like this.
No, no.
Kinda wobbly, aren't you?
Got to watch both ends at the same time.
Guess you better unwind it.
Arghh!
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up, Flower!
Is it spring yet?
No. Winter's just started.
What ya doin'? Hibernatin'?
Uh-huh.
What do you want to do that for?
All us flowers sleep in the winter.
Well... good night.
Winter sure is long, isn't it?
It seems long.
But it won't last forever.
I'm awful hungry, Mother.
Yes, I know.
Bambi.
Bambi, come here.
Look.
New spring grass.
Bambi. Quick!
The thicket!
Faster! Faster, Bambi!
Don't look back! Keep running!
Keep running!
We made it!
We made it, Mother!
We...
Mother!
Mother!
Mother, where are you?!
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!
Your mother can't be with you anymore.
Come.
My son.
Let's sing a gay little spring song
This is the season to sing
So I'd like to suggest
That we all do our best
And warble a song about spring
Spring, spring, spring
Let's get together and sing
Let's sing a gay little spring song
Just like the bird on the wing
Things always seem right
When you're cheerful and bright
So let's get together and sing
Sing, sing, sing
Let's sing a song about spring
Let's twitter and tweet
Like the birdies in May
Get into the mood
And be merry today
Forget all your troubles
And warble away...
Wait!
Oh, what now?
Hey! Hey!
Stop that racket!
Scat! Shoo! Shoo!
Let's sing a song about spring
I'll fix 'em.
There. I guess... that'll teach 'em.
Oh, what's the use?
This is the season to sing
Same thing every spring.
Tweet-tweet! Tweet-tweet!
Tweet-tweet! Tweet-tweet!
Love's sweet song.
Hm! Pain in the pin feathers, I call it.
Stop it!
Get out of here. All of you.
And you, too!
Hello, Friend Owl.
Don't you remember me?
Why, it... it's the young prince.
Bambi!
My, my, how you've changed.
Turn round there.
Let me look at you.
I see you've traded in your spots for a pair of antlers.
You know, just the other day I was talking to myself about you.
And we were wondering what had become of you.
Hello, Bambi!
Remember me?
Thumper!
Right-o!
Hi, fellas.
Flower.
Yeah.
Well, what's the matter with them?
Why are they acting that way?
Why, don't you know?
They're twitterpated.
- Twitterpated?
- Yes.
Nearly everybody gets twitterpated in the spring time.
For example... you're walking along, minding your own business, you're looking neither to the left nor to the right, when all of a sudden... you run smack into a pretty face.
You begin to get weak in the knees.
Your head's in a whirl.
And then you feel light as a feather.
And before you know it, you're walking on air.
And then you know what?
You're knocked for a loop.
And you completely lose your head.
Gosh, that's awful.
- Gee whiz.
- Terrible.
And that ain't all.
It can happen to anybody.
So you'd better be careful.
It could happen to you, and you, and...
Yes, it could even happen to you.
Well, it's not going to happen to me.
- Me neither.
- Me neither.
Ha! Twitterpated!
Oh...
Ahem.
Oh.
Hello, Bambi.
Don't you remember me?
I'm Faline.
Bambi.
Bambi.
Bambi!
I bring you a song
And I sing as I go
For I want you to know
That I'm looking for romance
I bring you a song
In the hope that you'll see
When you're looking at me
That I'm looking for love
I'm seeking that glow
Only found when you're young and it's May
Only found on that wonderful day
When all longing is through
I'm seeking that glow
Only found when a thrill is complete
Only found when two hearts gently beat
To the strains of a waltz
That's both tender and new
I bring you a song
For I'm seeking romance
You're by my side
There's a moon up above
It shines with a light
That's so mellow and bright
It's easy to see
That tonight we shall fall in love
I bring you a song
For I'm seeking romance
And you
It is Man.
He is here again.
There are many this time.
We must go deep into the forest.
Hurry! Follow me!
Faline!
Bambi.
Bambi, where are you?
Bambi!
Bambi!
Faline!
Faline!
Faline!
Listen.
- He's coming!
- Hush!
Be quiet.
- He's coming closer.
- Be calm. Don't get excited.
- We better fly.
- No. No, don't fly.
Whatever you do, don't fly.
He's almost here! I can't stand it any longer!
Bambi! Bambi!
Faline!
Bambi!
Bambi!
Quick, Faline! Jump!
Get up, Bambi.
Get up!
You must get up.
Get up!
Get up!
Now... come with me.
Bambi.
Hoo!
Wake up! Wake up, Friend Owl.
Wake up, Friend Owl.
Oh, what now?
Hey, what's going on around here?
- It's happened.
- Happened?
Yes. In the thicket.
Hurry up, Bambi.
Yes, Papa. I'm coming.
Oh. Well.
Look.
- Two of them.
- Oh!
Well, I don't believe I've ever seen a more likely looking pair of fawns.
Prince Bambi ought to be mighty proud.

I've nothing for loafers. Good day.
Hey, I'll clean up your yard.
- What?
- I'll clean up your yard!
I'll clean up your yard.
All right. But no more clowning.
OK, toots. It's a deal.
You won't know the place when I get through.
Be careful of my petunias!
Oh, you clown!
Surprise.
Well, guess
I don't get the cake, huh?
How do you do?
It's my very pleasant duty to welcome you here... on behalf of Walt Disney,
Leopold Stokowski... and all the other artists and musicians whose combined talents... went into the creation of this new form of entertainment, Fantasia.
What you're going to see... are the designs and pictures and stories... that music inspired in the minds and imaginations... of a group of artists.
In other words, these are not going to be... the interpretations of trained musicians.
Which I think is all to the good.
So now we present... the Tocatta and Fugue in D-Minor by Johann Sebastian Bach... interpreted in pictures by Walt Disney and his associates... and in music by the Philadelphia Orchestra... and its conductor,
Leopold Stokowski.
You know, it's funny how wrong an artist can be about his own work.
Now, the one composition of
Tchaikovsky's that he really detested... was his Nutcracker Suite... which is probably the most popular thing he ever wrote.
Incidentally, you won't see any nutcracker on the screen.
There's nothing left of him but the title.
And now we're going to hear a piece of music that tells a very definite story.
It's a very old story.
One that goes back almost 2,000 years.
A legend about a sorcerer who had an apprentice.
He was a bright young lad very anxious to learn the business.
As a matter of fact, he was a little bit too bright... uh, because he started practising some of the boss's best magic tricks... before learning how to control them.
Mr. Stokowski.
Mr. Stokowski.
My congratulations, sir.
Congratulations to you, Mickey.
Gee, thanks.
Well, so long.
I'll be seein' ya.
Bye.
When Igor Stravinsky wrote his ballet,
The Rite of Spring... his purpose was, in his own words, to ''express primitive life. ''
So Walt Disney and his fellow artists have taken him at his word.
Instead of presenting the ballet in its original form... as a simple series of tribal dances, they have visualized it as a pageant-- as the story of the growth of life on Earth.
It's a coldly accurate reproduction of what science thinks went on... during the first few billion years of this planet's existence.
So now imagine yourselves out in space... billions and billions of years ago... looking down on this lonely, tormented little planet... spinning through an empty sea of nothingness.
Uh, before we get into the second half of the programme...
I'd like to introduce somebody to you-- somebody who's very important to Fantasia.
He's very shy and very retiring.
I just happened to run across him one day at the Disney studios.
But when I did, I realized... that here was not only an indispensable member of the organization... but a screen personality.
And so I'm very happy to have this opportunity to introduce to you... the soundtrack.
Come on. Don't be timid.
That a soundtrack.
Now, watching him, I discovered that every beautiful sound... also creates an equally beautiful picture.
Now, look. Will the soundtrack kindly produce a sound?
Go on, don't be nervous.
Go ahead. Any sound.
Well, that isn't quite what I had in mind.
Uh, suppose we see and hear the harp.
Uh, now one of the strings-- say, the violin.
And now-- now one of the woodwinds-- a flute.
Very pretty.
Now let's have a brass instrument-- the trumpet.
Oh, all right. Now, uh, how about a low instrument-- the bassoon?
Go on. Go on.
Drop the other shoe, will you?
Well, now to finish, suppose we see some of the percussion instruments... beginning with the bass drum.
Thanks a lot, all of ya.
The symphony that Beethoven called the ''Pastoral''... his sixth, is one of the few pieces of music he ever wrote... that tells something like a definite story.
He was a great nature lover, and in this symphony... he paints a musical picture of a day in the country.
Now, of course, the country that Beethoven described... was the countryside with which he was familiar.
But his music covers a much wider field than that... and so Walt Disney has given the ''Pastoral''symphony... a mythological setting.
Now we're going to do one of the most famous and popular ballets... ever written--
''The Dance of the Hours''... from Ponchielli's opera
La Gioconda.
It's a pageant of the hours of the day.
All this takes place in the great hall... with its garden beyond... of the palace of Duke Alvise, a Venetian nobleman.
The last number in our Fantasia programme... is a combination of two pieces of music so utterly different... in construction and mood that they set each other off perfectly.
The first is
''A Night on Bald Mountain''... by one of Russia's greatest composers,
Modeste Mussorgsky.
The second is Franz Schubert's immortal ''Ave Maria. ''
Musically and dramatically, we have here... a picture of the struggle between the profane and the sacred.
