Steamboat rounding the bend!
Steamboat rounding the bend!
- The boat's a day early.
- It is that.
I gotta go down to meet it.
My new entertainers are on the boat.
All right, make your bets before the wheel stops rolling.
Make your bet.
Chief!
Sam, put a couple of cases of champagne on the ice.
Right!
Chief, chief!
Where's my daughter, Lettie?
- Him backstage.
- Get me my hat and coat.
The boat's coming in, folks. It's a day early.
Lettie!
- Lettie!
- Yes, Pop?
Is that music mangler getting familiar?
Take your hands off of my daughter.
- Why, Pop.
- Don't you know that ain't modest?
What a thing to say, and about your own daughter, too.
I'm not talking to you, I don't like you.
Well, come on, the boat's docking, we got to meet the people.
You have to wait. I can't wear this dress.
I have to change.
I can't wait. I'll go by myself.
And you take my advice, keep away from that fella.
- I know a crook when I see one.
- Pop.
I bet he'd steal your shirt.
Well, speaking of shirts, isn't that one of mine?
Yes, I stole it. I borrowed it. Here.
- See what it says there?
- Nope.
Made in Paris.
I tell you, he's a suspicious character.
The boat!
Pardon.
Have I the honor and pleasure of addressing
Miss De Valle and her charming ladies?
And you don't have to tell me that you're my new employer, Honest John Calhoun.
I recognized you at once from your description.
I've heard so many wonderful things about you, Mr. Calhoun.
About how honest you are... how generous and free-handed with money.
Thanks. But I'm not Mr. Calhoun.
My name is Candless.
I am the manager of Honest John Calhoun's Emporium.
The finest establishment in the northwest.
You may call me Pop.
Very well, Pop. That'll do.
Till I can think up something better.
Ladies, this way to the carriages, please.
Ladies, the next carriage is right over here!
Get the champagne ready, boys.
All the champagne.
Come right in, ladies.
Right up to the bar, here we are.
Champagne for everybody.
This is on the house.
Sarsaparilla for me.
To Belle De Valle. The belle of the Yukon!
- Very fine vintage.
- Nothing but the best.
My sentiments exactly.
- I so admire a man who doesn't drink.
- I never touch it.
Anything I can do for you, Mr. Candless?
Mervin, you're just in time.
Ladies, ladies!
This is Mervin, the town marshal.
- Hello, Mervin.
- Hello, girls! Glad to meet you.
Mervin, our new star, Miss De Valle.
Chief, show the ladies to their rooms.
And Miss De Valle, if there's anything that I can do, command me.
Well, thank you.
Isn't he cute?
Howdy, brother. I'm looking for Mr. Calhoun.
Mr. Calhoun is up-country.
He's looking at a mining claim.
- He'll be back tonight.
- Thank you.
Sam Slade's my name.
Haven't I seen you someplace before?
No. Clear case of mistaken identity.
Bartender, would love to have some of your best jug whiskey.
- What do you want to see Mr. Calhoun for?
- Why, I'm looking for a job.
I'm the town marshal. What's your game?
Game? Well, I'm a peace officer by trade, but I see that job's filled.
Peace officer? You don't look tough enough to hold down a job like that.
I ain't tough.
I just keep other people from getting tough.
- Pretty fast with a gun, huh?
- I don't like guns.
- So you use a knife?
- No, I don't like knives either.
I had a cousin, Walter, that cut his thumb plumb off just whittling.
That learned me about knives.
No, I just use reason.
You know, talk to people.
That wouldn't work around here.
Brother, be careful with that knife, this suit cost $14.
Just how would you go about talking yourself out of a fix like this?
Well, I don't know offhand.
Kind of reminds me of my Uncle Gus.
Used to be Sheriff of Bedville.
Uncle Gus only had one hand.
So, of course, a fella with just one hand couldn't use a gun or a knife.
Why not? He has the other hand.
Yeah, but naturally in the other hand he had a jug, like that.
Fella's got to have him a jug.
You can see for yourself, he couldn't use a gun or a knife with a jug in one hand... the other hand all...
Drink, friend?
I take great pride and pleasure... in presenting the Nightingale of the North, my daughter, Lettie!
"Every girl is different. Either she's a beauty
"Or she's brainy
"Or the kind you call on when it's rainy
"Every girl is different
"One prefers a baker, one a barber"
"I prefer a man in every harbor"
For a moment I thought the fleet was in.
"Every girl is different
"Some would like a salesman,
Some a watchman"
"I like roaming in the gloaming with a Scotchman"
Don't forget those bagpipes, dearie.
"Oh, look at the Duchess with a snooty air about her
"Her father used to run a livery stable
"When she went to school she wore a dunce cap
"She learned her lesson, and now she's wearing sable
"Every girl is different
"Either she's a tomboy, or she's fragile"
I swoon.
"Or perhaps she's discouragingly agile
"But isn't it a shame
"That men
"Are all the same
"You should learn to dance"
"When you twirl around it's such a grand sensation"
"That's for old maid aunts
"I know better ways to keep in circulation
"Every girl is different."
- "What are you?"
- "The slow type?"
"Or the fast type?"
"No, I think that I'm the made-to-last type
"Now I hope my lecture made you see the light
"But if you have the slightest doubt in the facts I've pointed out
"Why don't you browse around my library some night?"
Hey, chief, what goes on?
Boat come in day early.
- Hi, Mr. Calhoun.
- Hello, George.
- Place is going great guns, eh?
- Looks that way.
You know, you could double your take in here, Calhoun.
Yeah, by letting you put crooked dice and roulette wheels in here... and filling the place with your bunko men.
- That is blunt, but true.
- True?
But nothing to worry about as long as we're behind you.
My answer's still the same: No.
You can carry this honesty thing too far.
Yeah, but that's just a difference of viewpoints, George.
Now, you take the short view, that is, make all you can while you can.
I take the long view.
Establish a reputation for honesty... and do business with the same people all through your life.
- But suppose that...
- Put that back.
- So long, Mr. Calhoun.
- So long.
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Pop.
Who is that tall man standing over there?
- The one in the brown coat?
- Yes.
That's our boss, John Calhoun.
Honest John, eh?
Would you tell Mr. Calhoun
I'd like to see him in my dressing room?
- Say, Pop. How'd the show go?
- Great, great.
Miss De Valle would like to see you in her dressing room.
Miss De Valle? Oh, the new star.
Keep her happy.
- Miss De Valle.
- Come in.
Why, if it isn't our old friend, Mr. Jack.
- Viola.
- How are you?
We haven't seen you since you ditched us in Seattle.
We've talked about you a lot though.
And did my ears burn.
After you left, a jeweler came and took back that bracelet that you gave Honey... he said you didn't pay for it.
My goodness was there a to-do!
- Beer.
- Of course.
Why, that's the bracelet, isn't it?
The jeweler must have relented.
A very kind gentleman from Sioux City helped me out of my difficulties.
An elegant gentleman. A banker.
He didn't have much hair and he creaked a bit when he walked... but he certainly was a gentleman.
- Viola!
- All right, I'm going, I'm going.
You look great.
Belle De Valle. I like your new name.
I assure you, I didn't change it for the same reason as you changed yours.
What's your game up here?
I've got the greatest proposition in the world. I've turned honest.
And I'm sweet 16 and never been kissed.
It's on the level.
I figured
I ought to make something out of myself.
Amount to something in the world.
Come back and offer you my name and fortune.
You were thinking only of me?
But you don't have to believe me unless you want to.
I don't believe you.
You're just worried that I'll send word to the Seattle Police.
Telling them the whereabouts of one Gentleman Jack.
Now you wouldn't do a thing like that, would you?
Oh, no? First time you misbehave.
Now, skidoo. I have to change.
You can join me for supper.
- With wine.
- With wine.
And get this straight. No more playing around with that little red-headed singer.
You've got that all wrong.
We're just friends, we're just...
- Is platonic the word you're looking for?
- Yeah, platonic.
When you turn platonic, wolves will be vegetarians.
I'll be ready in a few minutes so you stay on tap.
And remember, don't get any ideas.
From now on, you fetch and carry when I whistle.
I don't know why you insist on hanging on to me.
You always did all right without me.
Sure I did all right without you.
But with you it's more fun.
Say, I'll tell you a nice number.
You know McGee?
- McGee who?
- Well, it's a song. Listen.
You know,
When You And I Was Young, McGee.
- Yeah, I know it.
- You know it?
- Let's go. You ready?
- Ready.
Thank you.
- I'm Calhoun, you want to see me?
- Yes, sir.
Come over to the office.
Pop Candless, shake hands with Sam Slade.
He's working here.
How are you?
Now I remember you.
We worked together on Winslow's Carnival.
You had the roll down and count.
And you were the short change artist.
- Well! Remember Chili Carthy?
- The sheriff with the long coat?
- Pop, see that everything outside is all right.
- Sure.
Sam, it's good to see you.
What took you so long?
Missed the boat.
I've come to take you home.
Wait just a minute, will you?
I want you to hear this.
All right.
My, that's lovely.
- Why don't you try it?
- All right.
Lately I find myself out gazing
at stars
Hearing guitars
Like someone in love
Sometimes the things I do astound me
Mostly whenever you're around me
Lately I seem to walk
as though I had wings
Bump into things
Like someone in love
Each time I look at you
I'm limp as a glove
And feeling
like someone in love
"Like someone in love."
Hey, Pop!
Me rob piano player's room.
Don't say rob, this is an investigation.
All right, me investigate room. Steal him.
The cur!
Get me a pencil and paper.
You're going to travel, you're going to Nome.
More sarsaparilla.
"Seattle Police, Seattle.
"Steve Atterbury is here.
"Come and get him."
Will you tell Mr. Calhoun that supper is served?
You know, this reminds me of when I was young and gay.
Cold bottle and a hot bird, and love.
- Isn't it grand?
- It is, but often it's only indigestion. Go on.
John, listen!
I thought I told you to stay off that stuff!
What's a man going to do when he finds out that his only daughter... has fallen in love with an international crook. A bigamist!
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about Steve Atterbury, the crook.
Our piano player? He's harmless.
Listen.
"Dearest Steve, I hope this letter will reach you...
"and that you will decide to come home and face the music.
"Sherry.
"P.S. The children miss you very much."
The heartless brute.
When I think of those poor little children a-weeping and a-wailing.
With no father to bounce them on his knee... and wipe their little noses.
So Steve's on the run, eh?
I'll find him and tell him he'd better get out of town.
No need to do that.
I've already put a spoke in that villain's wheel.
I sent a runner to Nome with a wireless to the Seattle Police... to come up and get that dirty crook.
Why, you whiskey-soaked idiot!
Didn't you realize if the Seattle cops ever light here... we'll all have to take it on the run?
I think I'll drift on a few hundred miles.
I forgot you're wanted in Seattle.
Forgot.
Hello, Viola. I'm busy.
Miss De Valle says supper's ready and she's waiting.
Tell her I'll be along in a minute.
And remember,
Miss De Valle doesn't like waiting.
What are we gonna do?
I'll send another runner with a wireless to the Seattle Police... telling them their man is in Nome.
- Come on.
- Where we going now?
To see that Steve gets on that boat to Nome tonight.
Good!
You better go sleep it off.
That peak must be 15,000 feet high, and it's perpetually covered with snow.
- It's one of the highest in North America.
- No.
- No what?
- No lectures, no statistics, that's what.
Not tonight anyway.
Every time we're alone together, you find something else to talk about besides...
Well, besides...
Well?
Well, it just seems a shame to waste all that moonlight.
Wonderful moon.
Lettie, you know how I feel about you.
I don't have to tell you.
Maybe that's how people know when they're in love.
Words aren't necessary.
And I know you're in love with me.
You're very conceited. But absolutely right.
It's like this.
I haven't any right to take you in my arms.
I got in some trouble back home and until that's straightened out, well...
I just haven't any right.
You see that, don't you?
Because when a fella kisses a girl like you he's gotta say, "I love you..." and, "Let's get married in a hurry."
Well, I can't say that.
So you see how it is, I just can't kiss you.
I see.
But I do love you.
And if I had the right, I'd take you in my arms and I'd tell you I love you.
Do you understand?
I understand it'd be very improper for you... to kiss me under the circumstances.
- Now, I better walk home with you.
- All right.
Well, I really have to go in now.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I better not kiss you goodbye, someone might be looking.
- Besides, you're not supposed to.
- That's right.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Cast off all lines, sir!
Here you are.
What do you want me to do, drown him?
No, just untie him when you get down the river a ways.
Take it easy, friend. You got lots of time.
- He's on his way.
- Good.
You got some change coming.
Only gave him $100.
Stand by, sir.
Them bells sure do sound pretty.
Always did like the sound of bells.
I remember one time...
Belle. I forget all about her.
Steve's new tune. Isn't it lovely?
You're just a little bit stuck on that fella, aren't you kid?
Nope. I'm not a little bit stuck on him.
I'm madly in love with him.
And I'm gonna marry him and have 13 children all in steps like this.
Boat's leaving, Pop.
Yeah, I know.
Steve's on it.
I know it's tough, kid.
Don't you think you better go up and get some sleep?
Good night.
John! Steve's on that boat.
I know.
Lettie, he's not worth crying over.
I'm not crying 'cause I want to.
Come on, come on. Keep your chin up.
- Honey, it's me.
- Come in.
That's the trail there.
Malemute's just a little ways ahead.
All right, thanks.
Next time you take a swim, don't forget to take your clothes off.
Come on, boy.
Better hurry, Lettie.
You're on in a few minutes.
I'm hurrying.
Tears are tough on the mascara, aren't they?
Here, let me help.
Is this the first time you've had your heart broken?
You're not gonna tell me it can happen more than once.
The heart is like one of those old Chinese vases.
It can have enough cracks in it to look like a spider web... but it'll still hold together.
What's the cure, if there is one?
Time.
Diamond bracelet helps speed things up.
A new hat.
The best thing's to get mad.
Break something.
Over the guy's head if possible.
- Lettie.
- Steve.
- I've got to talk to you.
- About what?
About that mess in Seattle.
- Is it true?
- Well, of course it's true, but I can explain it.
See, Lettie, after last night I didn't want you to think that there was any...
Look, I'm late for my number and there's no need of explaining.
When a fella and a girl with nothing much to do go for a walk in the moonlight... it almost always has to end up in that type of conversation.
Just as it almost always has to end up in a kiss.
Don't worry.
I'm late. Goodbye.
If I were the type to play around
it wouldn't be so bad
But I didn't know my way around
and what a time I had
I was taken for
a sleigh ride in July
Oh, I must have been a set up
for a sigh
A mockingbird was whistling
a sentimental tune
and I didn't know enough to come in
out of the moonlight
So the big romance
was only make believe
Just a sleigh ride
on a balmy summer eve
My dreams were safe all winter
and then to think that I
was taken for
a sleigh ride in July
Stop crying and get mad.
I can't get mad. I just want to bawl.
Just remember. A woman is always at her worst when she's bawling.
Or at least will be until they invent a powder and rouge that won't melt.
I guess I've been made an awful fool of.
Sucker is the word. Now get out there.
I was taken for
a sleigh ride in July
Oh, I must have been a set up

a sentimental tune
and I didn't know enough

Mervin, you know Steve, my piano player.
- Yeah, I hear he left town.
- Well, he's back.
He's been tapping my cash register.
There he is.
I hope you don't want him arrested.
It ain't that I'm kindhearted, Mr. Calhoun.
But it's too much trouble sweeping out the jail and bringing him his meals.
- I'll just run him out of town.
- No, he had that chance.
Now lock him up, and I'll tell you what to do with him later.
- Coming peaceable?
- No!
You didn't know when you was well-off.
I reckon you just want to see the inside of my jail.
- Morning, boss. Morning, Miss De Valle.
- Morning, Sam.
Say, you're pretty near out of dog, ain't you?
He's a cute little fella. Let me.
Come here, come here.
Say, he makes war talk, though.
I took care of that little matter, boss.
It'll be done this morning.
- Good.
- Here. You carry him, will you?
Belle, don't you think I look kind of silly carrying him?
Don't be foolish. You look very domestic.
I like you this way.
I always said if you devoted half the time to work... that you do to thinking up those confidence games... you'd be a very successful business man.
Hey, Mr. Calhoun! You look mighty silly.
Big man like you carrying a little dog like that.
- Prof. Salisbury.
- Yes?
I don't think you remember me, sir.
I ran a pack train for you when you made your survey in South America.
Yes, of course.
- This is Miss De Valle, Professor.
- Miss De Valle.
The Professor's the world's greatest authority on the weather.
- Come now.
- Yes, it's true.
He made the North Atlantic surveys... which have saved the lives of thousands of fishermen.
Really?
You're the first professor I ever saw.
I always thought they wore plug hats.
This is the town marshal, Professor.
Just the man I wanted to see.
I have here the data from the United States Government Bureau... on my two-year study of Alaskan weather conditions.
I'd like to deposit them in a safe place until I can leave for the States.
Why not put them in the safe in my place?
Marshal, take the Professor down to the Emporium.
Sure.
- Thank you very much. See you later, I trust.
- Certainly.
Right this way, Professor.
This is it. Come in for a moment.
This isn't San Francisco.
There's nothing you'd want in here.
A corset string is a corset string and I just broke mine.
- Be there in just a minute, Mr. Calhoun.
- No hurry.
The latest thing in straws.
Look, the only guy who would wear this would be a grade B idiot... on his way to the fireman's picnic.
- Anything I can do for you?
- Yes, a corset string, please.
We might have one in the stock room.
I'll take a look.
Yeah.
This is the hat.
- Nix, nix.
- This is a dream!
I like that fellow. He appeals to me.
Business man. Money in the bank, good reputation around town.
- Certainly.
- Takes up the collection in church.
- They can trust him with it.
- Of course.
- I like him.
- His wife probably has to help the maid.
I still like him.
I wouldn't mind helping the maid.
You'd be out of character.
You're the type that needs waiting on.
Just lately. I used to be the type that came from a family of nine.
I did the cooking, sewing, while my younger brothers and sisters were growing up.
But you were glad to get away from all that.
No, I don't think you'd like this kind of fellow.
Keep it.
I'd rather you were wearing it when I say this.
And if you laugh, I'll run a hat pin right through your vest pocket.
Let's get married.
Well, I'm not sure I like your being quite so surprised.
- Well, it's so sudden.
- I'm supposed to say that.
I never thought that you...
Of course not. Not when you're one jump ahead of the police at all times.
But you've changed. Now you even insist on taking a morning walk.
You've never got out of bed before noon unless the mattress caught on fire.
- You're different in a lot of ways.
- Am I?
We might find this all very boring.
I wouldn't. I promise.
Jack, this is all on the level, isn't it?
Of course it's on the level.
I'm as honest as the day is long.
That's wonderful. I haven't been so happy since the night you gave me the bracelet.
I wouldn't want another disappointment like that.
No, of course not. Everything's set.
And so, gentlemen, when the reports are published... you people of Alaska will no longer be at the mercy of the elements.
You will know when to expect changes in temperature.
No longer will the intrepid traveler of the northern wastes... be caught out on a trail by sudden cold spells and left to die.
You mean that you'll be able to tell when the freeze-up's coming in advance?
Unfortunately, we of the Government Weather Bureau... have not yet reduced our prognostications to an exact science.
We are occasionally in error.
Our predictions have sometimes missed by as much as 12 hours.
That'll be great. You know, if we can know within a day... when a freeze-up's coming, that'll sure save a lot of lives.
- This is yours if you open that.
- What for?
- I want a look at the Professor's report.
- I couldn't do that.
- See you later, Mervin.
- Thanks for the drink.
Hello, Mervin.
If a big fella had you in a fix like this what would you do?
How'd you talk your way out?
Mervin, the fix you got me in now reminds me a whole lot... of a fella I used to know down home.
Fella by the name of Hod Durning.
He was a great big fella like you...
- and he was cross-eyed, just like you.
- But I ain't cross-eyed.
I don't mean cross-eyed exactly,
I mean he had a cast in his eye like you.
I haven't got a cast in my eye, look.
Well, you're right, Mervin.
You ain't got no cast in your eye.
All right. Talk yourself out of this.
Hey, I'm on fire, I'm on fire!
I'm on fire, I tell you, put me out!
This your gun? Drink, friend?
- Mr. Calhoun.
- Hello, George.
What are you gonna do, a little gambling?
You wouldn't really call it gambling.
You mind if I use one of your tables?
- No, help yourself.
- Thanks.
Boys, let Mr. Maitland use this table.
- Game's closed, men, cash your checks.
- Thank you, boys, thank you very much.
Like to do a little gambling on the freeze-up date, boys?
Little too early for that.
We don't usually start until late in the fall.
What's your idea on the freeze-up date?
I got 3,000 ounces of dust, two to one that says the river freezes up... by September 15.
You're crazy. She ain't never froze before October 1.
Just put your money where your mouth is,
I say September 15.
I'll take 30 ounces of that.
- You got a bet. Get his name, Frank.
- Spike Roberts.
- When did you say the freeze-up was?
- September 15.
- I'll take 20 ounces of that. McClusky.
- I'll take 40 ounces. Tambrook.
- What did you say the odds were?
- Two to one.
Give me 10 ounces, Mills. 10 ounces.
- They fell?
- With a bang.
Avarice, avarice.
Man's greed always leads him to his downfall.
Your smart friends will undoubtedly be making some substantial bets... on the freeze-up date.
Are your men covering as much of the money as possible?
Not a cent. I don't believe in gambling of any type.
Well, I don't see how you stand to make a profit.
I do.
I wouldn't stay around here if I were you.
Leave while the suckers are happy.
An old rule of mine.
- Goodbye.
- Bye.
Anybody else think I'm crazy?
- We're all cleaned out.
- Who's gonna hold the stakes?
That's a lot of dust.
4,500 ounces of temptation.
Well, the Marshal here can keep it at the jail and watch it.
- Well, who's gonna watch the Marshal?
- You questioning my character?
Folks. Why not let Mr. Calhoun here hold it?
He may not be the only honest man in town, but he's the only one I know.
No, I don't want to hold the stakes.
But gentlemen... what's happened here tonight proves one thing we need in Malemute.
And that's a bank. I suggest a committee of citizens get together... and select some reputable member of the community to start one.
Now, the man selected should be sober... industrious, honest, and of good integrity.
- Nice billing.
- It was forced on me.
Good morning, Mr. Calhoun.
- I want to open a savings account.
- Yes, ma'am.
Why, Viola!
I thought it'd be safer here than in a mattress.
- What name, please?
- Viola Chase.
- A checking or savings account?
- Savings account, please.
- Be ready in just a minute, Mr. Calhoun.
- All right.
- What is that?
- It was a boiler, now a vault.
- There you are, sir.
- Thanks, Smitty.
Take a ton of dynamite to blow that baby.
My happiness is tinged with a certain amusement.
Doesn't it seem odd that you should be custodian of other people's money?
That's like setting a tiger to mind a baby.
What's the old saying about a tiger changing his spots?
Leopards have spots.
- Do I have to start acting dignified?
- Why?
A banker's wife has to be dignified.
Did you locate the minister yet?
No. Not yet.
Sent runners up and down the river but they haven't found him.
Alby will be here in a couple of weeks on his regular circuit.
A couple of weeks? I can hardly wait.
Not that I'm impatient or anything but... a Madam Lucille once told me that there's one thing a girl can't be too quick about.
- You're happy about this, aren't you?
- Sure.
I've never had much faith in banks but I happen to know the president of this one.
- I'd like to open an account.
- I shall be delighted, Miss De Valle.
- A checking or savings account?
- Both.
Mr. Calhoun.
- May we have your signature, please?
- Certainly.
- Mr. Calhoun, I got a problem.
- Yeah, what is it?
That piano player's ruining my whole life.
I spend all of my time waiting on him.
Do you think he's grateful?
Nothing suits him.
- He's always batting me.
- I tell you what you do.
Tonight, take him to Nome.
They got a good jail there.
Leave him and send a wire to the
Seattle Police saying they can pick him up.
That's the smartest thing I ever heard of.
On top of which, I got a girl in Nome who'll be mighty glad to see me. I hope.
- Thank you, Mr. Calhoun, thank you.
- Think nothing of it, Marshal.
If you ever run short, don't go to strangers.
You and me's going for a little ride.
I won't put these on you if you promise not to bat me. Promise?
I told you and told you to quit batting me in the jaw.
First thing you know, you're gonna make me mad.
Get up.
Marshal. There you are.
- Officer, do your duty.
- Go away!
- Arrest me. I know my constitutional rights.
- Go away!
- Arrest me. I got $700.
- Get off me, you big moron.
I got $700 and the jail is the only place in this town...
- Will you get out of here?
...where a man with $700 is safe!
- Arrest me...
- Get off.
...or you'll be derelicting your duties!
Go away, will you, you bore me.
Mervin, look at me.
See how mad that'll make you.
The key, where is it?
- Was it a big key, or just a little one?
- The handcuffs.
Let's look out there. More light.
- Prof. Salisbury.
- How do you do?
I ask you, sir, is this right?
I have been arrested in every state in the Union. And in several territories.
Once in south Memphis,
I was forced to build roads...
- and again in Chattanooga I had...
- Get up.
- But the key, George!
- Shut up!
So you've been in a lot of jails.
Well, you and I are gonna have a little talk.
Well.
The bank's been robbed!
Wait for me!
- I want all the dust you got in that boiler.
- Well, of all the...
Now, look here, you!
- How'd you tumble?
- Your professor got drunk and talked.
That was a pretty plan. When did you figure to grab the dust and run?
About the day after tomorrow.
Open it up. I'll do the running.
Honest John Calhoun.
You almost had me fooled.
All right, everybody sit down.
Very pretty.
All right, Mervin, start taking it out.
- Ever been to a lynching, George?
- No.
You will.
You'll be playing a most important part.
You can't get away. Those miners will run you down even if you have a two-day start.
- How were you gonna get away?
- On the Alaskan Star.
She arrives Wednesday and leaves Thursday... but I see I can't operate without you and you can't operate without me.
Why don't we just take this dust and quit all the jabbering.
You're a smooth character, Calhoun.
Looks like there's gonna be quite a party of us leave Thursday night... on the Alaskan Star. Partners?
Nothing like company to make a pleasant voyage.
That's right. But either Mervin or me will be dropping in to the Emporium... every couple of hours.
And if any one of the four of you are missing, it's gonna be rough.
I'll start yelling and there'll be a posse of miners on every trail.
- Until Thursday.
- Come on, Mervin, bring the empties.
- But George, I don't understand...
- Come on.
Looks as though you gentlemen are going to have to split more ways than you figured.
Give me a hand, boys.
Right pretty, huh?
It's pretty all right but it ain't gold.
- Where I come from we call it sand.
- Are you sure?
I got fooled with this once before.
I come pretty near marrying a homely widow with 40 acres of this stuff.
I knew those mugs would never get the best of us.
Come on, Sam.
Of course, you always intended showing your partners the real plan.
You don't think
I'd double-cross my partners, do you?
Not to give you a short answer, yes.
I suppose this is an unpleasant surprise.
I remember the old saying:
"The tiger cannot change his stripes nor the leopard his spots."
Well, what are you going to do?
I'd give a substantial reward for the answer to that question.
I wouldn't walk across the street with you.
You're acting a whole lot different from the girl I used to know.
That's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.
And as far as I'm concerned it can be the last.
Now, Mama always said, "Many a honest heart is concealed behind a simple face."
Well, your face is concealing something.
Marshal.
Too bad your prisoner got away,
I understand he outsmarted you.
Nobody better start picking on me.
I've had a very trying day and my nerves is all on edge.
I ain't picking on you, Marshal.
Just reminded me of a fella we had down home one time.
He let his prisoner get away from him and at the next election...
Talk your way out of this if you're such a much.
Well, I don't know just what to do.
Looks like you got me this time.
But you know, I just happened to think of what my Aunt Puny used to say.
She was my sickly aunt.
And when she got in a spot where she didn't know what to do... she'd just faint. Like this.
Here you are, Mervin.
Now, Aunt Puny used to say that in case of a nose bleed... put something cold to the back of the neck and it'll stop it.
This your gun?
Drink, friend?
Mervin, you and Sam look around town and pick up Steve.
He's as good as here.
Girls, I heard Pop sound curfew a half hour ago.
- Good night, Mr. Calhoun.
- Good night.
- Any luck?
- No.
Looked all over town for that young fella.
Can't find him no place.
- Are you the town marshal?
- I'm him.
The Alaskan Star hailed me coming up the river...
- and the Captain asked me to give you this.
- Thanks.
- What does it say?
- Official business.
You know you can't read.
I was gonna get somebody to read it for me later.
- You don't have to tell everybody.
- "To the Peace Officer of Malemute.
"Please hold for our arrival one Steven Atterbury."
We gotta find that fella tonight if we have to run this town through a sieve.
- Why tonight?
- So that Mervin can hand him to the cops... before they get off the boat.
If them cops start snooping around this town too much... some of us are gonna be very unhappy.
Come on.
Mervin. Throw that drunken Indian out.
Funny thing.
Never saw a blond Indian before.
Here he is!
Open up!
I'll give $1,000 to the man who gets him.
He went that way.
- What do you want?
- Nothing.
- Who are you?
- Nobody.
- Who's that?
- It's me, Steve.
- Steve!
- Lettie, I have to talk to you.
Say, you must have a pretty broad-minded wife... to let you come charging into girls's bedrooms this way.
Yeah, but they're chasing me.
And the police from Seattle are gonna be here in the morning.
- You've gotta listen to me.
- Don't try to lie out of it, Steve.
I know you got a wife and children in Seattle.
You're out of your mind!
What's all this nonsense?
Somebody tells you an idiotic lie about me and you believe them.
- That's love, I say...
- Come out of there with your hands up!
- Who, me?
- Yes, you.
Excuse me, Miss Lettie.
I thought I heard a man talking.
You mean talking like this?
I sometimes do that in my sleep.
You know, I could have sworn
I heard a man talking in here.
Well, you can see there's no one here.
I can see now.
- Steve.
- No kids, no wife. Believe me.
I do.
I believe you, I do!
Woman, you're hindering the law.
Well, there goes my $1,000.
I've got him!
I tried to give you a chance, young fella.
Too bad you didn't have sense enough to take advantage of it.
When do I get the $1000?
When you hand him to the police on the Alaskan Star in the morning.
And see that you don't lose him between now and then.
You want me to help you watch him, Marshal?
No!
Help watch him.
Little man... you're worth 1,000 of Mr. Calhoun's dollars dead... just the same as alive.
So try anything you like.
Yes?
Good morning, Mr. Calhoun.
Sit right down. There's an extra cup and the coffee's piping hot.
I always say that coffee should be clear as crystal...
- hot as the devil...
- And black as a thief's heart.
- Good morning.
- Is it?
- Some coffee?
- No coffee.
It'll do you good.
Lay out those dresses, Viola.
No coffee.
Mr. Calhoun, I know at heart you're just a diamond in the rough... but your barking doesn't frighten me a bit.
Diamonds don't bark. Pack those dresses.
So that's your decision.
You're cutting loose from me.
Spurned is the word they use in books.
It'll do.
Have some sense. I've got a tiger by the tail.
It's a choice between my skin and the kid's.
You wouldn't want me to put my neck in a noose, would you?
- Or would you?
- I'm considering.
If you feel that way, all you have to do is speak to the right people... and I'd be wearing a heavy iron bracelet.
- Pack this?
- Yes.
- Well, why don't you tell the police?
- I don't know.
Maybe being in love has something to do with it.
There's a whole epidemic of soft-heartedness around here.
- Don't worry. You're immune.
- I certainly am.
I think you'll change your mind.
And come running back to you?
Maybe a gentleman wouldn't say this, but I'd bet my last dollar that you will.
Well, don't you worry about what a gentleman would say. Now get out.
Are those tears?
The day I cry over a man... will be a day just like this.
Oh, Steve.
Stand by, sir.
Throw the line, sir.
- Let them alone.
- But l...
But you can't go over there. I'm giving them a chance to say goodbye decent.
I'm just a sentimental man at heart, I guess.
Stand by engine, sir.
Don't they make a pretty couple?
Both engines, full astern, sir.
- That's arson, ain't it?
- What?
- Him already having a wife and family.
- It's murder.
- But you can't reason with her.
- All right, stand back folks, gangway.
Gangway.
I'll tell these coppers to treat you nice on the boat.
Thanks.
Steve, darling!
- Sherry!
- I'm so glad you're here!
What a surprise. Lettie, this is Sherry.
My sister.
Your sister?
Well.
- Pop, this is Sherry, his sister.
- Then it was her that wrote the letter.
I didn't even know you had a sister.
He has two others and three younger brothers. The children miss you so much.
- So I heard.
- Sure takes a load off of my mind.
- Thank you, Captain.
- Good luck, chief.
Sir, your prisoner's right there.
Now look here, Officer, we'll fight this case in every law court in the country.
- Hello, Steven.
- Hello, sir.
- Who are these men?
- Mervin, the town marshal... and Mr. Candless. Meet my father.
See, Father, we thought I was going to be arrested for that trouble back home.
No, I paid the company the money your foolishness lost.
I guess it was mostly my fault.
I shouldn't have tried to force you into being a businessman.
Well, Steven, aren't you going to introduce me to the young lady... whose waist your arm is around?
- Sir, this is Lettie Candless.
- How do you do, Lettie?
Don't bother remembering her last name, she's gonna change that right away.
A crowded wharf is hardly the place to get acquainted... with a prospective daughter-in-law.
Well, what are we waiting for?
Come on, let's go!
Did you have a nice trip?
- Have a cigar.
- Thank you.
"Made especially for C. V. Atterbury."
Well, you know, that's a very funny thing... that you should have the same name as C.V. Atterbury... that owns all those railroads and steamships...
- and mines and banks.
- What's funny about that?
- You mean you are the...
- Let me assist you, Mr. Candless.
- No. Let me assist you, Mr. Atterbury.
- Thank you.
All right, make your bets before the wheel stops rolling, men.
Make your bet.
Pick your lucky number.
A toast! I want to propose a toast to Mr. Atterbury, my father-in-law to be.
And to Pop Candless, my father-in-law to be.
If you'll excuse me,
I must change for my number.
- And the name of that number is?
- The Ballad of Milicent Devere.
Ballad of Milicent Devere.
Sounds like something from Robert Service.
Mr. Atterbury, you're in for a surprise.
Viola, will you bring my things?
- I won't be a moment.
- A single moment will seem forever.
Spoken like a true knight of the round table.
Pardon me, Mr. Atterbury. I have to run down to the bank, but I'll be right back.
Pop, Sam. Excuse us, folks.
Imagine not knowing Steve had a sister.
Why there's seven of us children all told.
And father had four brothers and two sisters.
So you can see we've got a very bright future.
Anyhow, a busy one.
Hello, George, I got your message.
What's up?
Just want to talk to you about a few things.
- Double-cross, huh?
- Sort of.
The Alaskan Star sails tonight instead of tomorrow night.
That must have cost you something.
It did. But it'll show a neat profit.
Less people get a cut.
Come on, start moving.
Make a bad move anytime you want, gentlemen.
Miss De Valle. They walked out on us.
- Where do you think they've gone?
- That Mr. Jack, he's so industrious.
- He's gone to the bank.
- What?
I love hard working men, they come in so handy on the first of the month.
What a first class sucker I've been.
To think I believed that fellow.
All right girls, make your changes for the next number.
- Hold everything!
- Hold everything? You can't do that... the show must go on, you know.
- Why?
- I don't know.
To think I've got my own money in that bank.
- Anything wrong with the bank?
- The bank? What about the bank?
- I'm not saying it's unsteady or anything...
- I got money in there.
Your money will be safe. Probably.
"Probably" won't help me buy a chicken farm to retire on.
Kids, wait a minute, kids.
There's nothing to worry about.
If you draw your money out tonight.
What are we waiting for? Come on, let's go.
You can start down to the boat with that stuff.
I'll take care of locking up our ex-partners and catch up with you later.
All right.
But first, there's two things I gotta do.
What would you do if a fella did this to you?
- Well, l...
- That's one of them.
What's the other?
This.
Ain't no use to look on the boat for me.
I don't like boats. They make me seasick.
You thought I was dumb, didn't you?
Stay where you are.
You weren't a bit ruffled when Mervin walked out of here... with that gold dust, were you?
You know, sometimes I'm so smart
I surprise myself.
I knew exactly what Mervin was gonna do.
You were smart enough to sneak back to this window and take a peek.
That's just what I did. Open it up.
All right, everybody get in that closet.
Mervin's gonna be awfully mad when he finds... he's carried all that sand 1,000 miles.
- Looks like this kind of upsets things.
- Yeah, I know.
Just like Papa always said:
"If you lay down with hound dogs, you gonna get up with fleas."
- You kind of had some ideas yourself.
- What do you mean?
I know all about those horses you had staked out between here and Fairbanks.
Well, Grandpa used to tell me if a fella don't look out for himself, nobody else will.
Well, it looks like I'm in with nothing but a bunch of crooks!
- How do you know this here bank ain't safe?
- I'm positive it isn't.
Miss De Valle is Mr. Calhoun's sweetheart and she's worried about her money in there.
That's good enough for me.
I got 400 ounces of dust in there... and if I don't get it, he gets this!
Heap much trouble, Mr. Calhoun.
Many people come, they got ropes.
Hang everybody.
- Chief, go guard the front door.
- All right.
What are we gonna do?
You should have stayed away from here, there's a run on the bank.
- I know, I sent them.
- You sent them?
Of course,
I spread the rumor the bank wasn't safe.
You'd be surprised how quickly people believe a story like that.
Listen to them.
You ought to marry some honest fella and help him get along in the world.
That's not a bad idea.
We haven't got any money to pay off.
Mervin stole the sand because he thought it was gold and George stole the gold.
Suppose you go out there and try to bluff them with conversation.
That's your specialty. But I'll try.
It's been so nice knowing you,
Miss De Valle.
Let's all be quiet, please! Quiet!
Folks, your money is inside and is absolutely safe.
You're the only one that thinks so.
All this trouble has been caused by some malicious rumors.
We don't want any unsatisfied depositors.
Anybody...
Give us our money, we'll be satisfied.
Well, the bank opens at 9:00 in the morning.
- I want my dust right now!
- Wait a minute, wait a minute!
All right. The bank will open in a moment.
Take care of the keys, chief.
Are you crazy?
How are you gonna pay them?
Mama told me if I didn't go to Sunday school I'd wind up at the end of a rope.
We can't all hide in there.
Come on, give me a hand.
- I'm confused.
- Come on, get busy.
Pop, you take that set of scales,
Sam, you take that set.
I'd like to see the expression on George's face... when he opens up them sacks and finds out he's got sand, too.
- All right, chief. Open up, let them in.
- All right.
Quiet, folks. Form a line at each window.
Now don't crowd.
All your gold's safe, you'll get it.
I can see that I've always underestimated you.
Resourceful would be a good one-word description of you.
Thank you.
I can think of another word but I won't use it, being a lady.
Cover that.
- Here's some greenbacks.
- Calhoun.
- Atterbury wants to see you.
- Yes?
Hello, Mr. Calhoun.
I'd like to talk to you for a minute.
- Why, certainly. Step right in.
- Thank you.
- Miss De Valle.
- Good evening.
My boy, a situation like this can be disastrous.
So I've heard.
But I have no intention of leaving a man like yourself... in such a predicament.
There's no need to worry.
We're all right, the money's all here.
Mr. Calhoun, I pride myself on one thing:
My judgment of character.
When I first laid eyes on you
I said to myself:
"There's a fine, honest, dependable man."
I hope you're not injured, Miss De Valle.
Although I quite realize all this excitement would cause a lady to faint.
It was the shock. I'm all right now.
I should like, sir, to have you accept these drafts on San Francisco... for deposit in the amount of $100,000.
Mr. Atterbury.
Really, I couldn't, Mr. Atterbury...
I couldn't think...
Step in here, Mr. Atterbury.
Mr. Candless, a passbook, please.
- C.V. Atterbury?
- Correct.
- Shall I use your Seattle address?
- Yes.
C.V. Atterbury just deposited $100,000.
- What?
- What did you say?
- C.V. Atterbury just deposited $100,000.
- He did? C.V. Atterbury?
I saw him with my own eyes.
I don't know where to put this where it's gonna be safe.
I'm gonna put mine back in the bank.
Me, too.
Mr. Atterbury, would you please take off your hat?
Thank you. I've always wanted to see a halo.
You should look in your mirror,
Miss De Valle.
Mr. Atterbury.
I wish you fellas would make up your mind.
One minute you take it out, the next minute you put it in.
All right, next, who's next? Come on.
Please, Mr. Candless, may I have back my book?
I don't want to be robbed in the middle of the night.
Viola Chase.
You know, Viola...
"yes," would make it Mrs. Candless.
I won't say yes. I'll say maybe.
May I?
Now that you want to be a banker's wife, a little less flash.
You know, a little more conservative in public.
- And in private?
- Be your own calm, sweet self.
I know exactly what you mean.
The Canadian Northwest.
Here the first traders from the Old World intermarried with the lndians of the plains and forests to found a new race: the Metis of Canada.
Here, for two centuries these half-breed hunters and trappers multiplied and prospered a law unto themselves.
Then surveyors and homebuilders pushed westward bringing laws of land and property which threatened to end forever the free ways of the wild trails. ln 1885, resentful and confused, the half-breeds, under the leadership of Louis Riel, revolted against the advance of unwelcome law. ln that hour, a handful of hard riding men in scarlet coats, the Northwest Mounted Police, stood between Canada's destiny and the rebellion that was being kindled across the American border in a little Montana school house.
Three cheers for the red, white and blue.
Three cheers for the red, white and blue.
Three cheers for the red, white and blue.
Thy banners make tyranny tremble.
Three cheers for the red, white and blue.
Three cheers for the red, white and blue.
Three cheers for the red, white and blue.
Thy banners make tyranny tremble.
Three cheers for the red, white and blue.
Susie, you didn't sing the last words. l got scared, Mr. Riel.
He kind of looks like the big bad robber in the picture books. l'm going to let you all go home early today children.
- School dismissed!
- Bye, Mr. Riel!
Susie! Come here.
There's nothing to frighten you.
These are old friends from Canada.
Get the kid out!
Time is short.
-Run along. Don't imagine things.
-Alright. l'll sing good tomorrow.
You're not gonna be here tomorrow. l got your message, Duroc.
Returning to Canada is death.
For some maybe, not for us.
15 years of exile haven't changed you Corbeau.
Or you... l hope.
Canada change plenty. No more she belong to the half-breed.
The law come on the old trails, white people steal the land, the surveyor tell us where we got to live.
We send plenty letter to government.
She is too busy to listen.
Government take care of lndians, take care of white settler.
Ain't nobody take care of the half-breed people.
No half-breed gonna take care of himself.
She's gonna fight by Jove.
You gotta come back, and lead us.
-Against the Queen's soldiers?
-Yes.
-We tried that once.
-This time it will be different.
The lndians are in grand council.
More Black Feet and Cree than anybody ever saw before.
They'll join us if l say so, and fight. l got Cree blood, same as Big Bear.
-The lndian government...
-What? You and me, and Duroc, we will be the government.
With the lndians, we'll wipe the whites out of Western Canada.
We'll set up a new government.
Batoche gonna be our capital.
Half-breeds coming there by hundreds from the river and woods,...
-They still believe in me...
-Yeah.
You know what happens if we fail again?
We don't fail!
Corbeau's got something.
You've never seen a gun like that.
She squirt lead like a hurricane.
Trust Corbeau to know the newest way of killing.
-My gun shoots 1000 slugs a minute.
-lmpossible.
A Gatling gun stole near the border.
-Blood.
-Put on the dunce cap.
-l go fight alone. Come on!
-No! l will never let you lead my people.
You can be the saint that leads them Louis.
All l want is the whiskey business.
And l'll get it.
Or you'll get no help from the lndians. l don't want no help from a whiskey trader.
-You...!
-Corbeau!
Louis, if he don't get the Cree and Black Feet to fight those redcoats with us, we go smash.
And the half-breeds, they don't fight without Louis.
So maybe you don't like each other but you need each other very much.
Blood will run like water.
Blood? You won't notice it much.
The mounted police wear red coats.
Looks like bargain day in Batoche.
Trouble... Keep your eyes open and holster closed.
Left turn!
Present arms!
Present the arms!
Soldier, what for you don't do what l say? l go home.
Duroc, he's a go home.
Hey! Why you go home?
''Shoulder arm, hold arm, right, left, right about,...''
He change his mind too much. l go home.
Go home? Get back.
All you men obey the order.
-Come here!
-Red coats!
Johnny Pelang, dismiss the men.
Get the paper.
-Good boy.
-Shoulder the arms!
Redcoats coming, we dismiss now.
Go away, but don't leave.
You suppose the inspector's right and Riel is back?
The inspector's always right.
-The fort's 20 miles away.
-Dry up.
-Where did they get those revolvers?
-Santa Claus.
The police.
Cover up quick.
Hello, Freddie Monts.
Pretty heavy lunch box you got there.
She's just a little present for my wife.
Be careful she's not your widow.
-Brave man to give his wife bullets.
-Stow that.
There are men here all the way from the Parsnip. They mean business.
Fort Carlton tonight, same place.
Ronnie. l told you to forget that klootch.
She's poison.
-But Jim l...
-Never trust a blue eyed squaw.
There's the old wolf himself.
Go to hospital and call on your sister. Stay there until l come.
-Don't come on a stretcher.
-Sharp now.
-Hello, Jim.
-Hello, Dan. Quite a crowd.
Sure. Plenty friends of mine.
-ls Louis Riel here yet?
-He is the best friend we got.
Better advise him to go slow.
For 15 years we go slow.
Now we go quick.
We give you 24 hours.
On this paper we write what we want. lf your government say no, we make new government.
You're making a mistake.
-The law is in the Northwest now.
-So is this fellow.
You can't fight the whole
British empire?
50 mounted police, only 50. ln all Canada, only 500.
We got many thousand half-breed.
Big Bear and Crow foot got 10,000 warrior.
The lndians won't follow Riel.
Maybe they follow Jacques Corbeau. lf you bring back that killer you'll deserve what you get.
You're a great old wolf, Duroc. l'd hate to see you hang with that coyote.
-24 hour Jim, we want answer.
-You'll get it, if the wires to Ottawa stay up.
The wires, she'll stay up.
Just 24 hours.
Don't get them tangled around your neck.
-You think Corbeau no come, eh?
-He will if he smells blood.
Maybe he smell blood pretty quick.
Your blood!
Pull him down!
We're gonna fight! lf we want Corbeau, we'll be getting Corbeau.
The redcoat be skinned pretty easy. lf we want Riel, we'll get Riel!
-Didn't Jim ask you to stay here?
-Yes but...
Take your hand off that bridle!
Stand clear.
Let go of that bridle!
Shorty! lt's a boy!
A boy Shorty!
Don't you want to see your son?
A boy! Hang loose!
Out of the way!
My son he ask for see me.
Good for him!
Tod McDuff! l just have baby!
Remarkable.
-Hello, Tod.
-Hey, Jim.
Thanks for keeping Shorty covered, but l'm glad you didn't shoot. l was of a mind too but l was afraid l'd drop a stitch.
She not very big.
How you make sure that's boy?
Black Chief.
That's chief.
Look, Jim. l just got baby boy!
That's a fine papoose. l've got to tell my wife about this.
-Hello, April.
-Hi. l'll have to get Shorty's baby a rattle for that timing.
The baby arrived hours ago.
-Then you get the rattle.
-You rattle me enough as it is.
Hold still Niska.
Roll up my sleeve Ekawe. l will.
How can you deliver a baby, set a broken leg and look lovelier than a Christmas calendar all at once?
You're quite a picture yourself, you'd look good in a golf frame.
-Better in the same frame.
-Let's make it a family album.
Let's water the horses. We must get Duroc's message on the wire.
Right.
When you look at Ronnie even his hair stands to attention.
There's a contrary streak in the Logan breed.
-We just know our own minds.
-You don't know your own heart?
-l don't intent to listen to it.
-You will.
You're leg will be just as straight as sergeant Bret's back.
-Tell you what our plans are...
-Jim! l've been transferred to
Nova Scotia.
Nova Scotia?
What's that's where codfish grow, isn't it?
Orders are orders in my branch of the service too.
Niska! You mustn't eat that.
Your tummy will turn to stone.
Like your heart.
-l just don't understand.
-You'll never understand Jim.
Until something beats you to your knees.
Don't get yourself all over plastered.
-You love me.
-You see?
You don't ask.
You just make statements.
Well, do you love me? l might but l don't want to.
Help me, will you?
You're fine and right for yourself and for the service but
-anyway, l'm leaving.
-Running away?
-l'm no heroine.
-All Anglican nurses are heroines. l don't want to be bravely smiling goodbye to my husband every time he puts down a rebellion or goes on patrol to the North Pole. l just wouldn't let him.
When do you leave?
-Next month.
-We'll see.
Anything in the regulations about you always getting your woman?
No, but there should be. l gave the horses some water.
Have some yourself. l'll be there in a minute. l wish you'd think what it means to us if you leave. l'll have plenty of time to think in Nova Scotia.
Sure. What's time to a codfish?
But l'll track you.
To Nova Scotia, Afghanistan... or anywhere, because l still think we belong in the same frame.
Niska, do you think l'm a fool?
So do l.
You'll make somebody a good wife someday. ln the meantime we'll need you as a Mounted Police scout.
Duroc is my very good friend.
Nearly every night for 30 years we've played pinnacle together.
You can't be on both sides.
McDuff, you don't scout for the Redcoats?
-You don't turn against me.
-My father was a Highlander.
They helped knit the Empire together and l'll have no hand in unraveling it.
The inspector will swear you in at Fort Carlton in the morning Tod.
24 hours Jim.
You and me, like brothers Tod.
Aye, that we are.
But l cannot fight against the Queen.
Flesh of the snake.
Blood of the skunk!
You don't fight with us, maybe you don't fight with nobody. lt would twist my soul to fight against you Dan.
But l cannot fight against the Queen.
-Jerry.
-Yes?
Cover up for me after mess. l've gotta get out.
Next time tell that klootch to bring a friend.
Ottawa can't possibly act on these demands in 24 hours.
B0 atoche will boil over and scald half of Canada.
Rotten business. lf the lndians rise they'll be blood from here to Baffin Bay.
Come on!
Gates closing for the night!
Everybody out.
Civilians outside the stockade!
Get going, Uncle Blue Owl.
-Come on. Come on.
-Hurry it up there.
Hurry it up.
-Where can l find the head man?
-Headquarters over there.
Keep moving. Everyone out.
Hey you!
Who's that? Gabriel?
No civilians allowed in the stockade after retreat, mister.
-You'll have to come back tomorrow.
-Thanks.
Hold him for me, will you soldier?
He's part bull and don't like red.
A man from Texas, sir.
My name's Dusty Rivers sir,
Texas Rangers. l landed up here following a man we're after for murder.
Orderly, tell sergeant Bret l want him.
Yes, sir.
Ranger's commission.
Commissioner's deputy,
United States Marshal and here's my O. K. from your Regina office.
-l've heard of your organization.
-Thanks. We heard of yours too.
Thank you.
You come at rather a difficult time.
Sergeant Bret, this is Mr. Rivers of the Texas Rangers.
Howdy.
Texas did you say?
-Texas, is a United State.
-Yes, sir.
The Rangers are a organization rather like our own in some respects.
Yes, sir.
He's here on a police errand.
See that he's fed, billeted, and offered a bath.
Then help him fill out the proper forms.
Very good, sir.
That's mighty hospitable of you but l want to get started...
This way please.
They say Riel is gonna try it again.
Look out, l'm not Riel. l tried a lot of times l never got anywhere.
-Low bridge there Slim.
-Place wasn't built for a giraffe.
Gentlemen!
This is Mr. Rivers of the Texas constabulary.
-Rangers.
-Hello, constable!
Another criminal has leaked out of the US and he's after him.
You can sleep in that collapsible mantrap, sheriff.
Attention, to roll call.
-Constable Ackroyd.
-Here.
-Adams.
-Cameron.
-Douglass.
-Fyffe.
-Herrick.
-Judson.
-Kent.
-Kennedy.
-On patrol.
-Harder than rock but for your head.
-Lane.
-Logan.
Logan?
He was slightly overheated and went out to get some air.
Ronnie!
-Why you be so late?
-l was put on potato patrol. lf this potato is other woman... l eat your heart out. l was pealing one million potatoes just because l talked to you in Batoche.
Then maybe l don't eat your heart. l just keep him here, inside my heart.
Suits me molasses.
-Here. Want this for a padlock?
-Ronnie!
This lock both our hearts together.
Put it on for me please.
What's that?
Get! lf that wicked sentry finds you your cute little pelt will be nailed to the barn door.
Ronnie, maybe police no let me come Fort no more.
-Why?
-My father, he come back.
Who's your father?
He's very bad medicine. l remember long ago he cooked bear meat on stick give me piece in my hand.
Well l'll tell you what we'll do. l won't bite him if he doesn't bite me.
Please, you don't let my father bust us up!
Listen you little wild cat.
You're the only real thing for me.
Nobody, nothing could ever make me let you go. l love you so terrible bad l feel good. l'll be pealing potatoes the rest of my life for this.
-Douglass, a hand will you?
-Of course.
Mother and child, both doing nicely.
What do you ride in Texas?
Elephants?
They come in handy if you break a wheel on your wagon.
An uncle of mine visited Texas once.
Sir William Wade, perhaps you've met him.
We hung a fellow named Bill Wade.
That probably was not Sir William.
No!
Advise me what time Logan get in.
Good night Sheriff.
Revelly is at six o'clock.
-Re- what?
-Oh Revelly.
You fellows are pretty fancy!
Having ltalian food for breakfast.
Doesn't your organization rise by bugle call?
Sure! We blow Rev...
Oh! You mean Revelry. lt's been waking him up every morning and he can't pronounce it.
Any more than you can eat it.
We'll get your man for you. l was counting on being home by the 4th of July.
-Your birthday?
-No, my Uncle Sam's. lt's an American holiday.
Yeah. The States sort of set up housekeeping for themselves.
After being hatched and protected for 150 years.
-Don't mind him. He reads a lot.
-We stuck to our mother, that's all. lt's a wise child that knows its own mother.
A wiser one that appreciates her.
Good night Sheriff.
Good night.
But l still want to be home by the 4th of July.
Have your saddles ready for marching orders in the morning.
There may be action.
-Lights out. Good night.
-Good night.
Action tomorrow. You hear that?
Look, he's a Redcoat at heart. ls that the Rangers full dress?
Undress.
Very good!
Why do you carry two guns?
One don't shoot far enough.
-l'd like to visit Texas some day.
-You can.
Canadians get over to our country too once in a while. l'm after one of 'em now.
-Good night.
-Good night.
Good night.
That second red river cart looks like it had the mumps.
Wait. l'll talk to them.
-Good afternoon.
-How do you do?
What's in the carts?
-Take a look. lf you want.
-No, you have no warrant.
These aren't ordinary times, mister.
Rare wheels for a red river cart.
Open it up! Come along!
Pull the hide off.
Holy cat! Look at this!
Why did you do that?
We could have taken them prisoner.
There was no need to shed blood.
You're splattered with it too, Louis.
You can't back out now.
Get going!
Advance!
Get up there! Come on!
-Well?
-No word yet sir.
Fur!
Buy from me please.
-You buy these white ermines?
-No!
Buy from me please.
Furs. You buy these pretty white ermines?
What l got here is very fine, very young.
What you got is the oldest thing there is, only the original sale was for an apple not a fur. l no sell this for apple.
Stranger! l wouldn't buy any furs from that Beelzebub!
-She steals them!
-You tell lie!
Somagun Scotch lndian!
-l think l kill you.
-Heathen. l'll take you across my knee and tan your hide.
-l kill you!
-Oh you would!
Let go my hair! Let go! l'll get you for this!
-l'll skin you for this!
-You're gonna get it!
Let me go!
Take her hands off her or l'll beat your teeth out!
Logan!
Tod, report to the OC.
He'll swear you in.
Aye Him. Daughter of Beelzabub, l know how to handle a woman. l told you to keep away from this fort.
Pretty soon you'll no be boss no more.
Get out of here!
Wait a minute!
Where did you get that ring?
What you care?
Logan, l want to talk to you. l warned you about that klootch.
-My personal business is my own.
-She's a thieving little... l ought to wipe your jaw for that.
Don't be a fool.
-lt's because she's part lndian.
-No! Because she's all bad.
You'd lose your eyebrows if l married her, wouldn't you?
-Why?
-Why not?
-l don't see why all this...
-Do you know who she is?
-l know who she's going to be.
-She's Jacques Corbeau's daughter.
Look out! lt's April!
What happened?
Call the hospital orderlies.
Get the doctor!
Put that man out there.
Take this one first.
He's dead.
-Corporal take charge of the body.
-Dr. Roberts. This way sir!
-There's two of them in there.
-Gently, he's badly hurt.
-Who is it?
-l don't know!
Corporal!
Clear these people.
-Come on!
-Let Miss Logan through!
How'd it happen?
Constable Fenton.
-Where did you find him?
-On the Red Berry trail. l was on my way to a case.
How long were they lying there before you found them?
-lt happened just before l got there.
-Did you hear firing?
-Did you see any tracks?
-Some red river cart tracks. l couldn't tell how many horses.
-What Fenton able to say anything?
-He said something about a gun but...
Constable Fenton, what happened?
Wagon train, sir...
Carrying a...
Gatling gun.
-A Gatling gun?
-Somebody running guns to Duroc.
-Did you recognize the men?
-No, sir.
But funny foreign looking saddle.
Fenton, can you describe the saddle?
Did it have a big silver horn?
Biggest l ever saw.
What the boy saw was a Mexican charro saddle.
Probably ridden by the man l'm after, Jacques Corbeau.
Corbeau?
Have the bugle sound boots and saddles.
-Patrol of 20 men.
-Yes, sir.
Good job Miss Logan.
Better stay at the fort.
Batoche is not safe.
Thank you but l have several patients in my hospital. l wish l was one of them...
-Boots and saddles!
-Come on!
No member of the force shall discuss the situation with any civilian, except in being in the regular line of duty.
Alright. Bedrolls and kit bags on the wagons at once!
Don't let the grass grow under you.
Come on!
On the double.
Get 'em out there.
Pick 'em up. They won't bite.
Be sure you put that on the horse Logan.
-One keg of horseshoes.
-Right.
Don't forget the nails this time.
You can't sew them on.
-Right.
-And an extra wagon pole.
-That breaks you'll pull it yourself.
-Right.
One coil of rope.
You boys can sure slap a saddle on pronto.
Come on!
On the double!
Fresh team for you Miss. lnspector's orders.
-Thanks. l can hitch them.
-lf you say so ma'am.
Fall in!
-l'll hook 'em up for you Miss.
-Thank you.
Back up here you lucky horse. lt belongs to the Mounted Police.
-They're pretty good, aren't they?
-They're the best.
-My name's Dusty Rivers.
-lsn't that a contradiction? l expect you've never been to Texas, Miss...
-Miss...?
-April Logan.
-April? You're not fooling?
-No.
Here's your horse, sergeant.
Head 'em out.
Group mount!
Reform ranks!
Eyes right!
Eyes front!
At ease!
Make much of your horses!
April, l'd rather you didn't go back to the town.
Sergeant, what part of the parade do l ride in? l'm sorry, you're not going with us.
-April, with Riel on the warpath.
-l'm sorry too,
-but l am going with you.
-Corbeau is wanted for murder here.
He belongs to the Mounted Police now.
He belongs to whoever catches him first.
Hi, sis'!
Let your brother kiss you goodbye. ln the line Logan. l'll be glad to tend to any unfinished chores for you.
There are some things about you that l don't like.
-You're not exactly perfection.
-This isn't Texas...
Jim! l think l'm capable of deciding who l'll kiss goodbye. l'm not sure that you are.
-You ought to obey him.
-Do you?
-Not always.
-Your judgment's good enough for me.
-Patrol all present, sergeant.
-Very good.
-Patrol ready to march, sir.
-Pick up the trail at the scene. lt'll probably take you to Big Bear's camp.
-Yes sir. March them off.
-Very good sir.
March!
March!
Sections right!
Right!
Wire from Headquarters, sir.
Sergeant Bret!
Patrol halt!
-Dismiss you men, sergeant.
-Beg your pardon, sir?
-Dismiss your men.
-Very good, sir.
-Sergeant Field, take over!
-What the..
Dismiss the patrol.
Sections left about!
-What's up?
-We're staying here.
Not me, amigo. l'm gonna get Corbeau. lf you ride through that gate l'll place you under arrest.
-You can try.
-Sergeant! lnspector's complements: Will you,
Mr. Rivers and McDuff report at once.
Change of orders from Regina.
No patrols to leave until we're reinforced by Colonel lrvine. lt'll take a week. By then Corbeau will have Big Bear on the warpath.
And the Black feet.
-Couldn't you wire Regina?
-No!
The wires were cut two minutes after this came through.
Does the order prohibit sending out a single scout?
No. l'd like your permission to proceed to Big Bear's camp alone
-and try to keep him loyal.
-No! Only a loon would do it. lt's a ticklish job, but permission is granted. l'll leave at once, sir. l'll leave at the same time. l'd be grateful if you'd bind and gag this Texan.
-l'm not going where he is.
-Where do you want to go? l figured to pick up Corbeau in Batoche.
-Why do you think he's there?
-That's Riel's capital, isn't it?
You can't make an arrest in Canada. lf l got to have a nurse... give me the Scotchman.
McDuff, you'll accompany Mr. Rivers.
And gentlemen l hope you keep your scalps.
A nurse, at my time of life...
-Good hunting.
-Thanks.
-Sure you make that fast.
-Alright miss.
Climb aboard McDuff.
-Where are you going?
-Batoche.
-l wish it was 1000 miles.
-Seat's too hard for 20 miles.
Lady, to me it's just like sitting on a cloud.
Get!
-Are you riding with us Jim?
-No. The other way. l'll send you a postcard.
Canada is a lot different from what l expected.
The scenery?
-No, the people.
-Haven't had much time to tell.
Sometimes it strikes you at first sight... l mean...
You can usually figure a man by the way he handles his horse but women are different.
What did you expect
Canadian women to be like?
Like the scenery: good to look at but kind of frostbitten.
But you're not. l've always understood Americans were too busy building, and selling and shooting each other to waste time saying nice things to women.
-We get around to it now and then.
-Must be appreciated by your wife.
-Who's wife?
-Aren't you married? l've always held that a bachelor is a fellow who never makes the same mistake once.
You believe that? l did... until mighty recent.
Do you think a plant from up here would do alright in Texas? l don't know Texas.
Even the moonlight's warm and soft along the Pecos River.
Do you have fast horses in Texas Mr. Rivers?
The fastest in the world.
Betting they cannot keep up with the men?
Look!
-What happened, Mrs. Burns?
-Don't go into Batoche.
-They've looted the Trading Post.
-And driven us from our homes.
-How could Duroc permit it?
-He tried to keep order but... when Corbeau got there...
-Corbeau?
-Yes.
Excuse me, lady.
Enough!
Just one thing more.
Riel can tell you how this new government sets up.
But l'll tell you how it's going to win.
10,000 lndians turn loose on Saskatchewan.
They'll be nobody left to pull down this government when l'm finished.
Canadian woman who has so sweet the eyes, who has so sweet the eyes, who has so sweet the eyes, who has so sweet the eyes, who has so sweet the eyes,
Gentlemen,
Corbeau has promised you the backing of Big Bear.
When Big Bear leads the Cree nation upon the war path the Black Feet will rise with him.
Our fire of wrath will consume its oppressors.
From it will arise, not half-breed, but a free and independent Metis nation.
Don't mind me, mister.
Go right ahead.
Duroc, who is he?
He's officer from United States.
Want talk with Canada Government. l bring him here.
They found out quick.
Hey! l'm a Deputy US Marshal, Mr. Riel
-And...
-You know my name.
Sure! Who don't?
Here's my credentials.
We'd be happy to know if your new government means to work hand in hand with the United States.
The Metis of Canada will be happy to cooperate with the USA.
Suppose some fellow commits a crime in our country then trails up here to hide out.
We'll help you in every way just as we hope you will help us.
That's fine because l got a warrant here for the arrest of a man named Jacques Corbeau.
On a charge of murder.
Gentlemen!
Council is recessed.
Wait here.
That put a bee in Riel's bonnet.
-This bee on your bonnet.
-What's the matter with it?
-My first bullet shoots him off.
-Why you wanna ruin my bonnet?
Just so you know it is me who fires the second shot.
The one that go between your eye. l'll make you a small wager.
50 cents that l put a bullet through your vengeful heart before you shoot the knob from my bonnet. l take that bet and l take the money from your pocket because you'll be dead.
Corbeau.
-There's a US officer here.
-For what?
-You.
-Well?
He wants a warrant from my government for your arrest.
-Why don't you give it to him?
-But we need you for the lndians. ln two hours give him your warrant.
Tell him l'm in Big Bear's camp.
He can arrest me there.
He would never leave that camp alive.
You don't want him killed here, do you Louis?
At an lndian camp, who cares?
Once the Cree warriors were free men.
Canada belonged to you and to us.
Well it's gonna be ours again.
Take the warpath with us.
Fight!
Fight like you used to fight, and not one of these prairie cops will be buried with his scalp on.
Big Bear, that medal you wear is the Queen's.
The great white mother who sent food to you when you starved.
You're too wise to let a liar make bad blood between us.
Men say Queen no longer rule us.
Redcoat no more our friend.
This is our friend that bites with a thousand teeth of fire.
Make gun talk to them.
-lt'll tear it to rags.
-Squaw make new lodge.
A hole in the tent won't change the British Empire.
This man is going to hang. l don't want to see you beside him.
Make gun talk.
Two more strangers. l want his scalp. l know him.
Well you sure found
Corbeau alright.
You're as welcome as a broken leg.
Ahkakito, who these men?
Spies to count your men and horses.
His tongue is forked.
He said he came alone.
This man is no spy.
He comes from afar to take
Corbeau who killed in his nation.
Like Mounted Police want
Corbeau because he has killed here.
Are you afraid of Redcoats?
Their blood spills like other men's.
Look here Chief.
Before you turn that man over to the Mounted Police, l got an order for his arrest not only from the US, but from his own Chief, Riel.
And if you... l'm paid 72 cents a day to protect dummies like him.
Peace.
We got no war with the Redcoat.
Yet. But they no take away my friend.
You both come alone, you both go alone. l have spoken.
Big Bear was a great chief.
His friends will be sorry for him.
Now you die.
You can kill me and take this back but its medicine will be gone.
The great white mother gave you this to let you rule over thousands.
You are not chief unless she gives it back to you.
Big Bear will join his blood brother and fight for Riel.
Go.
Big Bear, you're a great Chief.
Why we heard of you way down in Texas.
But how do you know who's the best fighter?
The Mounted Police or Corbeau, the great killer of men?
-You better get out.
-Rivers.
Peace. Talk.
Why this fellow's killed in Texas, and killed in Canada.
He must be a great gunfighter, but have you ever seen him kill?
How do you know all these yarns are true? l'll show you if they're true.
He offers to show you.
Let him kill now.
Who he kill?
Me.
Another will die.
Slide my guns back in their cradles, untie my hands and l'll hold them out.
Then tell this tough man to go to it.
Cut the thongs.
Put back the guns.
-The man is daft.
-He's great!
Now tell him to kill.
Kill.
Go ahead Corbeau. Draw.
Tell him to draw Big Bear.
He's been bragging about how he's gonna kill? Start on me.
Kill.
Draw you yellow pole cat!
You're a good hand at shooting men in the back. What's wrong now?. l won't foul a great Chief's lodge with the blood of a dog.
He's yapping across the trail, to save his Redcoat friends.
But the medicine gun, she'll roll them all in the dirt. l have not seen this yet.
Then look.
What a thing!
That gun strong medicine.
Shooting painted horses is not killing men.
Before the sun has set three times l'll bring you the Redcoats of the Mounted Police, made redder with their own blood and full of holes like a net.
You're not a feather to be blown about by the talk of a coward.
Bring me in your hand their empty coat red with blood before three suns have set and my braves will take the warpath.
Before three suns have set
Corbeau will wear iron on his hands.
Come on!
Very nice entertainment indeed.
Now if you'll cut me loose l'll endeavor to show my appreciation.
You're alright, Sheriff.
Let's mush.
-l came here to get that fellow.
-l think we'd better move before Corbeau finds out the lndians took the bullets out of your pistols. l won't tell on you.
Come on.
Whatever you did at Big Bear's camp these men have undone.
What else could we do?
Our horses were stolen two nights ago.
You should have blown it up!
Leaving 10,000 rounds of ammunition at Duck Lake is inexcusable.
When my wife heard the half-breeds were coming through Duck Lake on their way to attack Prince Albert, she grabbed the kid and we left.
Thank you. That's all. l didn't think about saving anything but our scalps.
-We're going after that ammunition.
-Very good, sir.
But Col. lrvine's relief force is due shortly.
Relief or not, we cannot allow that ammo to fall into Riel's hand.
-l don't like the smell of this.
-What do you mean? l'm curious to learn where Corbeau plans to find the bullet ridden red coats he promised Big Bear.
That won't be his first lie.
Sergeant.
You will post sentries commanding Beardy's Basin.
That's the only place we could be ambushed this side of Duck Lake.
There's an old cabin there?
That's the cabin.
See that Basin below you? lf Riel's brigade cuts back from the Prince Albert road they'll come through the river bed there.
Each man two hours on watch, two hours rest.
Two hours on your feet, and two hours on your back.
At the first sign of the enemy fall back at gallop and report.
-All this time the half breed army...
-Moving in the other direction.
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.
You'll be relieved tomorrow.
Bye. Keep your eyes open.
Same to you.
Ekawe!
You fix leg.
Come sit in this nice green chair.
Does the cast hurt you?
No, you help her good that's why l help you.
-Help me? How?.
-You fix. Don't look at me.
Redcoat march for Duck Lake.
Half-breed, they wait in wood, kill Redcoat.
But l thought Riel had marched on Prince Albert.
That's just for trick.
They make trap for Redcoat at Duck Lake.
An ambush?
With the medicine gun?
Yes.
Your brother keep watch on cabin at Beardy's basin.
They gonna kill him tonight.
So he don't see them make what you call ambush.
Ronnie!
Ronnie?
You just trying to scare me. l don't like you pretty much.
But it's Ronnie who's in danger.
-You think l like him too much?
-lf you like him, you can help him.
What do you mean, like? l love Ronnie.
That's why you no like me.
You think l'm no good for him. lf you love him, you'll do as l ask.
He's on outpost duty at the old cabin near Beardy's Basin.
Go to him. Tell him to warn the Police not to march on Duck Lake.
-Why don't you go?
-They won't let me leave Batoche.
Nobody would stop you.
What you think?
Me save police?
Pretty soon my father have all the whiskey business and l wear silk and rings. l think Ronnie like that. lf you don't warn the Police,
Ronnie will hate you.
Maybe that man you love, that big sergeant gonna be killed.
Maybe bullet go through that Scotch lndian.
-Louvette.
-Somofagum, you think you better than me, you go save them. l'm not better than you. lf you want rings, l'll give them to you.
But don't lose anymore time. l beg you on my knees if that will make you go.
Soon medicine gun knock police on their knees.
Maybe tomorrow night the wolf come for what is left.
You say you love Ronnie while you brazenly sit there eating, knowing he's gonna be killed.
There's nothing in you but hate.
You're a savage Louvette.
A vicious, cruel savage.
Blood and revenge is all you know,
-not love.
-Hey you! l'll show you love.
What you want l tell Ronnie?
You'll go?
Sure l go.
Tell Ronnie the half breeds will ambush at Beardy's Basin.
Sure l tell him.
You go home now.
We'll never forget what you've done for us.
No. You won't forget.
-What's after you?
-A big bad rabbit.
Chased me all the way back.
-Male or female?
-l didn't ask.
My tobacco is in the saddle bag.
-Steal it sparingly.
-Thank you. l will.
You need wife for clean the house.
What in the...
What are you doing here?
-How'd you know l was here?
-My father is mad on me.
-Why?
-He find out l got big love for you.
Why didn't you tell me
Corbeau was your father?
Tonight he take plenty half breed made big ride to Prince Albert.
-But when he come back...
-Answer me...
What do you care who is my father?
You hate Jacques Corbeau more strong than you love Louvette. l'd be bat brained about you if your father was the devil himself.
You don't never marry with me now.
Once this is over l'll marry you quicker than you can say Somagum.
That's too late.
Why?
My father gonna kill me
'cause l love Redcoat.
We be married tonight or we don't be married never.
Tonight? lndians shoot priest at Frog Lake today.
Now at Batoche, Duroc he's scared for Father Piccard.
Gonna send him to Regina when daylight come.
Please, he marry us before he go.
-But l can't leave here.
-Nothing happen here.
Why you here for anyway?
Orders.
But you be back before somebody know.
Somofagum. l love you so terrible much.
But l'm on duty.
They'd hang me, shoot me, boil me in oil.
You don't love me because who my father is.
Try to understand. l have to watch the river bed.
That other fellow could watch.
Get in river bed with him. lf your neck wasn't so lovely l'd break it.
You break the heart.
-Always l know you lie to me.
-No!
But that lie is sweet and my heart, she sing like a bird. l don't live without you, Ronnie.
You crazy little loon.
What do you think you'll do?
-l'm going.
-No, you won't.
You're the sweetest poison that ever got in a man's blood. l love you. l want you.
We'll be in Batoche in one hour.
Maybe less.
Ten minutes with the priest.
An hour to get back here.
Ronnie! l'll leave word for Jerry he'll have to take15 minutes of my guard.
He'll yell, but he's a good egg.
Ronnie!
Ronnie, they're coming.
Wake up, Ronnie.
Get back to the fort!
The half-breeds ride.
Warn the force! Ambush...
-What happened to this town?
-They all go Prince Albert to fight for Louis Riel.
We wait in here for Father Piccard. lt's dark as a weasel's bedroom.
Louvette!
The rifle!
Quick, Louvette!
The gun!
You don't need gun now, Ronnie.
Tie him here.
You crawling black scum!
-Shut up.
-Don't you hit him.
-Get out. Get out.
-Pay now.
Get out.
Get out.
Well, come on.
-Cut me loose.
-l got to keep you here. lf l don't you be killed like the others.
You sneaking shewolf.
Killed? Like what others? ln Duck Lake woods 1,000 half breed make trap for Redcoat.
The whole force will be cut to pieces.
-Every man of them.
-Yeah.
But you're alive is all l care.
You, dirty squaw.
Why didn't you tell me? l'll kill you when l get loose.
When you be safe you kill me all you want.
Back to the column. Warn them the outpost's been killed.
Danger of enemy on all sides.
Gallop.
You'd better get back with the column.
Thanks.
That blue eyed klootch has got him.
-That's destroying evidence.
-Which might put that boy in front of a firing squad. lf the whole column rides into a death trap he'll deserve whatever he gets. l was thinking of his sister.
Do you think it'll help to make her pay for his mistakes?
Somebody's paying for it right now.
Sound commence firing.
Take what cover you can find!
-Turn the wagons over for barricades!
-Yes, sir!
Bring those wagons forward!
Steady men!
-Load!
-That gun!
She speak death like the rattling snake.
Yes. She'll get me them red coats for Big Bear.
Now that side!
Sergeant Bret and that Texan are coming through.
-Give them fire cover!
-Yes, sir.
Clear there...
-Help the Sergeant.
-He's alright.
You got nine lives, Sergeant.
Have a spill bud?
No, thanks, just had one.
Keep your heads covered men.
Still got one good arm Bill, use it.
Take your time!
Don't waste a shot!
-Look at that hat. 20 bucks.
-Wear a feather.
Get us out of this crossfire.
Fall back on Carlton.
Yes, sir.
Palmer, Rankin, root out that snipers nest to the rear.
-Right that wagon for the wounded.
-Right.
First section, open the Carlton road.
Sections on the right, fall back 50 yards.
Left sections hold fast.
Bugler, sound retire and continue firing.
Pick up all rifles.
Don't leave any ammunition.
Give me 10 men and l'll hold the road while you drop back.
You drop back with the men. l'll hold the road. l can't hear you.
Louvette.
Let me go to them. l'll do anything. l'll give you anything.
No, Ronnie. l don't let you be killed.
Doctor!
-We're back at Fort Carlton.
-How many got back?
-We don't know yet, sir.
-Many?
No, sir.
They were in the woods thicker than boiled beans on Tuesday.
But we couldn't see them.
Jerry was on outpost.
Why didn't he warn us?
Jerry's dead.
They must have got
Logan when they got Jerry.
Nobody got Logan.
He went over the hill.
-l heard the Sergeant.
-Look out!
Ronnie didn't seem to be that kind of a chap. lf Ronnie had the slugs in his legs l've got in mine he couldn't have run so fast.
Shut up, you fools!
That's his sister.
You always show up where you can help.
They let me leave Batoche is morning.
-What are they saying about Ronnie?
-They're all out of their heads.
Do any of you know where Ronnie is?
-They don't know, April.
-Keep that stretcher working, Sheriff.
-Doctor, the inspector's real bad.
-Alright.
Get this man ready. l'll be back.
-Some brandy here.
-Sergeant, bring that brandy.
-He's lost a lot of blood, no?
-Yes.
-Jim...
-l'm glad you're safe
-but l wish you were anywhere else.
-l tried to get here in time. l could have saved all this... l'd give that tourniquet another twist.
Where's Ronnie?
-ls he... is he...?
-No. l'm sorry. l have to go to the lnspector now.
But...
Don't fight. You'll be alright. l told you to take care of the men.
-Yes, but...
-Nevermind me. Get to the others.
Yes, sir. ls there an assault?
-Not yet, sir.
-Man the bastions. l have, sir.
Did you get proof that Logan deserted?
Yes, sir.
When this is over, make it your job to get him.
Bring him to justice.
Justice... l'm about to get mind.
-Take command, Sergeant.
-Very good, sir.
Some fool at Headquarters, wants to change the uniform to green.
Stand up for the Redcoats. lt's a good color.
-Any sign of a rush?
-Just steady sniping.
-Tod...
-Keep your head down lad
-if you don't want to lose it.
-Can you reach the river?
There's a very good chance.
Get the bateau and canoe and moor them 100 yards below.
We'll try to get through tonight.
That l will.
-Take his place.
-Right.
Look! Look What l see!
-Don't shoot.
-He is police scout.
He the Scotch man.
He's mine!
Nobody shoot.
Where is the knob from the bonnet?
Darn!
Blood of the devil!
Bonjour, you snake in the bush?
Duroc, you old porcupine.
-Foosh to you.
-You son of a pumpkin?
That's a pawky trick.
You snooling clootie!
Who is snooling clootie?
You bairn of a buzzard.
My yarn, my bonnie yarn! l'll never dare to show...
Aye.
You... You skunk you.
Such a thing!
Darn these pants!
Hold 'em up with your teeth.
You, dirty Scotsman!
Bonnie thing you look going naked through the fen.
For goodness sakes!
Yon goes the seat of the government?
Blood of a skunk. l'll show you.
Pig!
Sharpshooter down there seems to have McDuff cornered.
-Got a sight on him?
-No. He's behind...
Now l can.
Dan! Dan!
Dan... l didn't shoot you.
You win the 50 cents.
No Dan. lt was from the fort.
You showed yourself.
You're an old fool my friend.
One more game of pinnacle l skin from you the belt.
Aye, that you would Dan.
-That you would.
-No, Tod. l lose.
No, Dan, it is my loss, every man's loss this day.
The Big Trapper got me by the neck.
The 50 cents she's in my pocket.
Soup?
-Any more soup and they'll bust?
-l must get this...
-Stop carrying it long enough...
-But...
You've been ramming around here for 10 hours, using up all the Queen's bandages and l never saw you beat.
Well, you haven't been playing croquet.
Special orders is you stop now.
And have a cup of coffee.
Dusty, what happened?
Happened?
Did something happen? l didn't notice anything happening. l don't like women who cry.
You know something, lady? l make the best coffee in Texas.
You can float a horseshoe in my coffee.
Over and over l hear them say his name but they won't tell me anything.
Look... just kind of
-get down some of this Java
-Even Jim won't tell me anything.
Two sugars?
Jim is a great soldier.
But if you don't drink this here coffee...
Where is Ronnie?
What's happened to him?
Now listen... l don't know Ronnie so very well but l know you.
The first time l saw you l knew you better than anyone l've known. l know it couldn't be in your brother's blood to be cowardly.
But, love does funny things to people.
You've been a good soldier. l've got a tough job for you, if you'll take it.
You want me to put some salt on Corbeau's tail? l'm trying to get the wounded to the river under smoke cover.
-What smoke?
-We'll burn the fort.
-Coffee?
-Thanks. lt'll be your job to get April and the wounded down the river to meet Colonel lrvine's reinforcements.
-You'll stay and roast chestnuts?
-l have 7 men sound enough to ride. l'll be there when Corbeau throws those red coats in front of Big Bear.
Looks to me like you're just delivering seven more red coats.
Maybe.
Jim.
You've got to tell me. l know it.
But let me tell you first that l love you.
Always l guess. You'll never be able to look at me again.
Nothing under heaven can ever bring us together...
What do you mean?
You've got to know it, so l'd rather you knew it from me.
Ronnie is not dead.
He deserted.
He left his post, left his companion sentry.
He was killed.
He could have warned the column.
All those men lying dead might still be living if Ronnie...
-but he ran away.
-No, no!
He ran away with that half breed
Corbeau's daughter!
But l sent her to him, to warn him, to warn you.
Didn't you know he'd sell his soul for that girl? l don't believe Ronnie deserted. lf you prove it to me 100 times, l still won't believe it.
Jim lad, the half-breeds being a wee bit confused with the death of poor Dan Duroc. lt's the time to be going.
Tell Corporal Underhill to have the patrol in full dress order sidearms and rifles then set fire to the buildings.
Aye, all is ready then now. l hope you never believe
Ronnie is guilty but that doesn't change my job.
When this over l'm going to get him and bring him back. l will get him if l have to follow him over the icecap.
You know what that means for him. l know you're duty comes before everything else. l know it means more than mercy or love.
Go on, follow your orders.
Kill that boy who was foolish enough to put love first!
But don't tell me how sorry you are!
Just do your duty and kill!
We'll take you and the wounded as far as the river.
Dusty will take care of you there.
We're going on to Big Bear's camp.
Pray that l don't come back.
You'll have to let me look after you now.
-Better throw some wash in my face.
-What? l have no right to be crying over my troubles.
The wounded must be moved. They'll need all the help we can give.
Looks like you need some help yourself lady.
Attent hut!
This is a volunteer patrol.
Once we've entered Big Bear's camp no man of you can properly expect to come out alive. lf any of you prefer to go with the wounded you may fall out.
Thank you.
Fyffe, you're hurt.
You'll have to go with the wounded.
No, l'm alright. l can fight.
Join the wounded as directed.
Yes, sir.
We'll take the wounded to the river first.
Keep them under cover.
Corporal, mount the patrol.
Patrol! Prepare to mount.
They die in there you think.
Maybe so. l don't see nobody come out.
Men with leg wounds man the paddles.
Dusty and McDuff, scout the shores with a canoe. lt's a dangerous place you choose lassie. l can't leave these two men.
They're the worst hurt.
Good luck, Soldier.
Thanks.
That'll be Colonel lrvine's relief column. ln camp, beyond the bend.
That's a pretty sounding noise. l was afraid these boys would never see that camp.
You're going to and you'll get some rest. l'm leaving.
-Why?
-Going hunting. lt's no use.
Jim has Corbeau by now.
-Or Corbeau has...
-l wasn't thinking about Corbeau.
Ronnie?
Well, l'd like to have a powow with the wolfgirl he's been with.
Ronnie's dead. l know he is.
He wouldn't run away.
He'd come back and face it.
Sure he would.
Maybe he can't come back.
Maybe he sort of lost his head. l got a feeling l can make things easier for you if you'd let me.
You're grand person, but there's nothing anyone can do for me.
Sure there is.
Come to Texas with me. lf Ronnie's alive, he'll find us there. l'll never see Ronnie again.
He's gone.
Not when somebody cares as much about you as l do. lf you want what's left of me after all this l'll go with you. l'm a coward Dusty! l want to run away.
You're the loveliest and gentlest woman l've ever known but you haven't closed your eyes in 24 hours. l don't want you to say yes without thinking. l don't want to think.
When we get to Texas, you won't have to.
-Texas must be heaven.
-lt will be when you get there.
Pull into shore Tod, then take
April down to lrvine's camp. l'm splitting off here.
What manner of frisky are you up to now?.
Well, there's a couple of things l got to do. l kept my promise Big Bear.
Red coats full of holes like a net.
This one belonged to that Sergeant who said he'd put me in irons.
Medicine gun speak like thunder.
Keep your promise, Big Bear.
War!
Kill. War!
War!
So dead men ride?
You cannot kill the dead.
Tell your war chief to spread his blanket on the ground Big Bear?
Tell your men to fire!
Kill the dogs!
You tell me they are dead.
Let us know what dead men want.
Nestestu! Put the blanket here.
The blanket!
Put the blanket here.
The spirits of the brave are still inside their red coats.
They are sacred. Tell your men to lay them on the blanket.
The brothers of the dead are brave.
Put them on the blanket.
No, no! These enemies are in your hands. Pull them down!
Kill them! Now! lf one shot is fired, the soldiers of the Queen will come like the sands of the great salt sea.
You and your sons will die and your children's children will never walk on the Earth.
The other coats Big Bear.
We are waiting.
Put the coats on the blanket.
Pull 'em off the horses!
Kill them!
Are you afraid of 7 men?
Kill them, you fools!
There's no magic in their red coats.
Throw them to the crows.
Like this.
You're under arrest!
Shoot, you fools! Shoot!
Shut up!
Two men on the left, dismount.
Take the prisoner.
-On your feet, now.
-What's the matter? Tired?
You're too heavy to carry.
Will Big Bear kneel to the Queen and be the chief of his people again?
The Cree are brothers to the brave.
This fellow keep Redcoats out of Batoche.
Look!
The canoes go down river by himself! lt's my bateau, come on!
Look! Come on!
-Let's go!
-Don't let him go.
You know Louvette?
No Gatling gun, no Riel, no lndians, no fight.
You come home, l give you all the fight you want.
Yes, mama.
-You know Louvette Corbeau?
-l know no one like that.
Well, l guess that's right.
-You want something?
-You know Louvette?
-Yes.
-Of course.
-Louvette Corbeau?
-Sure. Come on.
Are you hungry?
No.
You don't feel good, huh? l feel alright.
A man's brain can be sick.
He goes on breathing and living until he rots.
My heart wants you so much.
She all the time say your name.
Ronnie, Ronnie... l should have torn your tongue out the first time l heard you say that.
No, we go away Ronnie.
Way up to far North.
To land of little sticks.
Nobody don't find us there.
One man l can't get away from even there.
A filthy rat that can't stand the sight of his own face.
Me.
My love, l make you forget.
Forget? l ought to...!
You want to kill me? l'm too much of a coward even to do that.
Because l love you.
Two wild geese go north.
Hello, Ronnie.
Why you come here? l was just passing by. lt looks like this war is kind of bogged down.
You come here for hurt him?
Nothing l say could hurt him any. lt's already been said.
-What's been said?
-Don't listen to him, Ronnie. l want to know!
Well, that you ran from your post and you're hiding out like a skunk and haven't got what it takes to go back and swallow your medicine.
-Does April say that?
-No.
She figures you're dead.
She knows if you could even crawl you'd get back there to face 'em.
Don't listen to him! lf you go back they kill you.
She may be right.
The militia's brought in martial law.
You know the Mounted Police are a great body of men.
For years they've been through hell without a yellow mark against them. l'd hate to see April's brother be the first to chalk one up.
Make him go away.
He just talk crazy lie for you.
-l'm heading for Batoche, coming?
-No, Ronnie, no!
You coming?
What for? l'm already buried in the grave of every man killed at Duck Lake.
-They're bound to find you.
-With your help?
No, they don't never find. l fix so you don't tell nothing. l won't turn you in, but April's got a right to know.
Why don't you let me stay dead?
Because you're not a coward.
Whiteman, ride horse with white face.
Go quick, Crow.
Go get him.
Viva Canadian womens, fly my heart, fly high!
Viva Canadian womens, who has so sweet the eyes!
Who has so sweet the eye!
Who has so sweet the eye!
Ronnie?
He's gone to Batoche. l loaned him my horse.
Ronnie!
Ronnie!
Ronnie!
Ronnie...
Kill...
Kill...
Kill...
How much l morn for you...
Love does funny things to people.
Captain Gower of the Canadian Militia is here to help us get what facts we can concerning the ambush at Duck Lake before the General convenes his court martial.
Yes, sir. l'm the one to blame.
Not my brother. l sent her to him, sent her to warn him.
Miss Logan, none of us are on trial.
We're only trying to find out what happened. l should have known Louvette would lie to him.
-That she...
-That she was in love with him and would persuade him to run away with her.
That's not true!
Ronnie wasn't afraid of anything. lf he's alive, he'll come back. l'm very sorry but the evidence we've gathered is conclusive.
Sergeant, you are personal assignment is to keep after Logan until you've place him under arrest.
Yes, sir.
-That is all!
-Capitan Gower...
-What is it?
-l don't know. Someone got killed.
Fall back!
Fall back there!
Constable Logan reporting.
Ronnie!
-Who is this man?
-An American Peace Officer,
Texas Rangers. ls this Constable Logan's body?
-Yes, sir.
-l don't understand.
This boy was captured. Look at his wrists where the thongs cut in.
They thought you ran away...
The man has been bound certainly. l don't know how he got loose but when l saw him he was free.
Maybe he could have got back to report but he didn't.
Because there was something he wanted more than he wanted his own life.
-What do you mean?
-l mean the Gatling gun.
What did Logan have to do with the Gatling gun?
The half-breeds had it on the bluff, commanding the south approach.
We saw what happens to troops who rush a gun like that.
But the kid could rush it because he was on the inside of their lines.
Now you all decided he quit his post.
Where l come from we don't jump to conclusions. lt's liable to be a fellow's last jump. l can tell you every move the boy made.
And l can tell you this, if you'd had 3 more men like him you'd have put down your rebellion in 24 hours.
He got their boats in the river to pull the crew away from the gun, then he got a horse and dragged the gun off riding like a bat out of hell.
The half-breeds spotted him but he got the bluff above the river.
Bullets were as thick as flies but they didn't stop him over he goes, horse, man, and gun rolling like a Texas twister over the sheer drop.
That's where l find him.
That's where you'll find the gun at the bottom of the river.
He never gave up.
He never quit.
He never ran away from anything because it wasn't in him to run.
He just kept going on like l think you'd want him to.
Constable Logan shall receive the highest military honors. l'll mention Logan's bravery to General Middleton.
Where were you all this time? l was squeezed under a log so tight l was breathing on the installment plan.
Shall l include that in my letter to your Texas Commandant? l hope you won't. l'll be in trouble enough without Corbeau.
Dusty!
You're an angel in leather. l'd look funny with leather wings. l'm sorry l misjudged a brave man.
Yes, we... all are.
Sergeant!
You will deliver prisoners
Riel and Corbeau to Regina.
-Last stop before Regina.
-Long way to ride
-before a hanging.
-They don't think so.
You be tying a wet knot.
Eight days with them traveling 200 miles.
Cold molasses could move faster.
Thank you.
-Where's Jim?
-Went riding with April. lf l should disappear, you know, vanish will you tell April l'll be back for her? lf you're as blind on the trail as you are with your lassie you'll never find your way back. l could never manage one of these contraptions. lt's a shame to waste it.
Either the hand of fate or someone thinks you ought to shave?
Well?
No, one maybe can get through, but there's no chance for two.
Find your own finish. l'm ready for mine whatever it may be. l'll have my knife back now. l give it to you!
No, sunny side up.
Now we're heading back for Texas. l hid your horse under that silver mine you call a saddle.
Just a minute, cowboy!
Going somewhere?
Don't look like l'm going very far.
Come on out, April. lt's nobody but Dusty taking a little ride.
Just trying to get away from it all.
Can we ride a little way with you, Dusty?
Why yes, ma'am.
Do Canadians ever go snow blind in the summer?
We're all a little blind sometimes. l'm not.
There's talk some fellow may try to get Corbeau away from us.
-How's that again?
-lt's only 100 miles from the Montana border.
And no telegraph. ls that so? l'll check when l get back. lf anyone's missing l'll have every man in the troop after them. l can't say l blame you.
Jim, Dusty seems a little restless.
Maybe he's thinking about a man who moved in on a friend that trusted him.
Sneaked in behind his back like a weasel in a hen coop and stole the one thing his friend valued most.
No, l wasn't thinking about that.
Wouldn't you say he'd loathe his friend for doing such a low contemptible thing to him?
He'd certainly owe him an apology.
Well? l apologize.
You apologize?
Jim's trying to tell you that he's taking something he thought belonged to you.
You? lf l'm free.
She told me once, l'd be alright if something beat me to my knees. l've been brought down hard.
No, l'm the one who surrendered.
But l wouldn't change him. l guess l've just been having a beautiful pipe dream in the middle of a nightmare.
Sure.
Sure, you're free.
You got what we both want, l got what l came for. l'll say the Mounted Police are the greatest outfit l ever tangled with and the luckiest.
Texas Rangers are two fisted fighters themselves.
And one of them is the most magnificent liar in the world.
Goodbye, Dusty.
Texas is gonna miss you.
There'll always be a part of Texas in our hearts.
Come on, sweetheart.
Come on, sweetheart.
SubRip:diamarg
Give him a rubdown and plenty of feed. Yes, sir.
Logan Stuart's the name.
Thanks, Mr. Stuart.
Damp day.
How's Jacksonville?
Lively.
Credit to account?
I'll take that specie.
We're short of cash at the diggings.
What time do you open in the morning?
Tomorrow's Sunday.
Then put the specie in the saddle bags and I'll come by for it before you close tonight.
You must have around 7,000 here.
That's no trinket to be left lying loose around a hotel room.
Gold is only yellow gravel,
Cornelius.
Yes, but the yellow color makes all the difference.
Butter's yellow, too, and you can spread it on bread.
Ever try that with gold?
For a business man, you've got odd ideas.
If I were a banker, as I shall be some day,
I'd set you down as unsound and lend you nothing.
A man can choose his own gods,
Cornelius. What are your gods?
What?
Damp day.
Let me see that.
Yes, sir.
It's a beautiful little locket. It came from England.
I'll take it.
A fortunate young lady, whoever she is. Anything else, sir?
Yes, I need some dry clothes, shirt, socks, everything from the skin out.
Hey, Logan! Come here.
How are you, McLane?
Fine. Just the man I want to see.
What are the Indians doing down your way this year?
So far, quiet and uncertain.
Whiskey?
Whiskey.
Whiskey.
Logan, I've got a consignment of general hardware from the brig Alice to be delivered to Clay
& King at Jacksonville.
It's cloth, rope, tin dishes, buckets.
I'm shipping by boat to Salem.
Do you want to pack it from there?
How many mules will it make?
Oh, 20, I suppose.
What's your freight?
Three dollars a mule per day.
Agreeable.
It'll be in Salem on the
20th. Two more of the same.
Not for me.
I've got to see if I can get a load of windows hauled out to Gales Creek.
Windows?
Windows with glass?
We're becoming civilized.
Oh, Bob. Bob Miller.
Lumber's selling sky-high in San Francisco.
You sure enough will make a handsome profit, Captain.
Miss Lucy Overmire arrived?
In Room 10. Just off the
Cascades boat. Thanks.
She's been asking for George Camrose.
We got through all right.
But the train back of us, 50 wagons, not a one of them left.
Come in, George.
Why, Logan!
Hello, Lucy.
Oh, George had to make a sudden trip to Crescent City.
He knew I was coming up, so he asked me if I'd bring you home.
Will you mind having me on your hands, Logan?
That was a foolish question.
You don't mind having women on your hands.
Where did you get that?
Rumor.
George Camrose, I bet.
Oh, have you got stout clothes?
I want to get started before daylight and the weather's foul.
I don't mind.
How was your visit up at The Dalles?
Quiet.
Oh, Logan, there were a lot of cattle abandoned by the emigrants.
You could probably get them for very little.
Did you see any mules?
No.
Well, five o'clock then, and dress warm.
We'll make Salem the first day and Toms River the second.
We should be in Jacksonville
Friday afternoon, unless that's traveling too fast for you.
No.
I suppose you're going down to play a little poker now.
I guess not. Good night.
A woman, Logan?
I kept open for you.
Thanks.
I was just reading in the Advertiser they've completed a suspension bridge across Niagara Falls for the railroad. Well, that's progress.
Out our way, we haven't even got a stagecoach yet.
Well, you've got to have the roads first.
Maybe it's the other way around.
Get the stagecoaches and there'll be plenty of roads.
Well, from a banking viewpoint,
I'd want to be sure there were roads there first!
What's that?
I said, from a banking viewpoint, I'd...
Oh, poohdaddle!
Come in, Logan.
You see, it wasn't a woman.
Why didn't you say so then?
You're marrying George, not me.
What have you got in the saddle bags? Gold coin.
You know, I was watching you from the window.
There was a man standing at the corner of Alder as you passed and he followed you.
Don't worry about it.
Good night, Lucy.
Good night.
Logan! What happened?
A bad try. He got away.
Who was it?
I have an idea it was Bragg.
He had an arm like a chunk of oak.
You're hurt!
I'm all right.
Lucy, you better get out of here.
Go on to bed and get some sleep.
We're leaving at five sharp.
What makes you so sure it was Bragg up in Portland?
He might have trailed me.
He's had me on his mind for quite awhile, ever since those two miners were killed over at Evans' Ferry.
The ones the Indians murdered?
Indians?
I was out on the road that morning and I saw Bragg come out of the willows running his horse.
A few minutes later, I stumbled onto the two bodies.
I could've had him hanged for it and he knows it.
Why didn't you?
That was rather careless.
I didn't see him do it.
You wouldn't want to hang a man if there was the slightest doubt.
No, you wouldn't.
Things have got to be dead even with you, is that it, Logan?
Ease up there!
Easy, easy.
Where're you from?
Salt Lake.
No good back there anymore.
Too populated.
Get over here!
Get over here!
Come on!
How are things along the way?
One miner was killed last night over at Graves Creek.
Indians?
Are you game to make a night ride of it?
We'll reach Ben Dance's by daylight.
Fine.
Howdy, Logan! Come on in.
Tired?
Dead.
Go along in.
Hello, Mr. Dance.
Morning, Miss Lucy.
Breakfast is awaiting.
Asa, come out here and get these horses!
Hi, Logan!
Hi, Logan!
"Hi, Logan"? "Mr. Stuart," you young varmints.
Now rustle off them horses and give them a good feed.
Well, how'd you find things on the way down?
Not too bad.
Had a little trouble over at Graves Creek.
One miner was killed.
Yeah, Indians.
They got a Cavalry outfit under some young lieutenant combing the canyon for them.
But I got a little bet with myself he'll get bushwhacked first off. He don't know Indian style.
Why didn't you tell him, Ben?
You can't tell them army fellows nothing.
They got a little brown book.
If it ain't in that little brown book, it just ain't true.
How was Portland, Logan?
A thousand people and raining.
How can anyone live in such a crowd? Come and eat, Lucy.
I couldn't eat a thing,
Mrs. Dance.
What she needs is some sleep.
Well, hello, Caroline.
How are you, Logan?
Oh, I don't think you two are acquainted.
Lucy, this is Caroline Marsh.
Lucy Overmire.
I've heard about you.
I'm so sorry about your father.
I brought you something from Portland.
Did you? What?
If you have on your best
Sunday dress around noon time,
I'll give it to you.
Will you fix a bed for Lucy, dear?
We traveled all night.
And when you travel with Logan, you travel.
Come along.
I thought maybe she'd be on her way back to England.
What for?
Her folks come out here to start a new life for themselves.
She's not the sort to give up just
'cause the Indians killed her pa.
It's a joy having her around, Logan.
We always wanted a daughter.
Sure.
But like all good-looking daughters, it don't look like we're going to keep her long, Ma.
Logan... I mean, Mr. Stuart, do you think the Indians will break out?
It's always possible, Asa.
A peace treaty don't seem to mean nothing to them Rogue beasters.
Well, it's their land and we're on it and they don't forget it.
Things'll be all right,
I reckon, unless some medicine man stirs them up or some white cuss starts something.
You'll know it beforehand, they'll get insolent.
That's the time to fort up.
Well, this is my fort and darned if I budge.
That's right, Ben.
Ma is sending Caroline over to McGarry's place.
Mrs. McGarry's come to her time.
Now, there's everything you'll need, dear.
You want me to send Dr.
Balance back from Jacksonville?
I can do whatever's necessary.
Oh, for sure, it's only a baby.
You stay at
McGarry's tonight, Caroline.
I'll be over tomorrow and ride back with you!
Give my hellos to your ma, Lucy.
Say I'm lonesome for talk.
Bye, Logan!
Hey!
You ain't got much time!
Well, here's where
I leave you.
It takes me back to England.
It's just like my grandmother's.
Hey! Come on!
Thank you.
Oh, Logan, there's a cabin-raising Saturday week.
Liza Stone and
Gray Bartlett are marrying.
I'll be there.
You'd have had your kiss if I hadn't been here.
Yes. I'm sorry I caused you to miss it.
But what's any woman to you?
You're never happy except when you're on the go.
I guess I'm just stuck on this
Oregon or maybe I'm just ambitious.
I want to see a Stuart
& Company pack outfit stringing along every road.
And when stages come,
I want them to be my stages.
Is that what makes you so restless and discontented?
Or is it a woman, Logan?
Must it always be a woman?
Take me to the Rogue River Valley
Valley
Where the silvery moonlight shines
Some one waits for me in the valley
There among the blue-tipped pines
She'll be by the river
Where all heaven beams
And there by the river
We'll find the trail of dreams
Donkey, don't you dare to dally
Can't you hear the kill deer song?
Say, Hi. When did Honey
Bragg get into town?
Well, it looks like he just rode in the way his horse is lathered.
Must've done a little riding yourself.
All the way from Portland.
Don't tell anyone.
Huh?
What was that song you were singing, Hi?
Oh, I don't know.
Just a little song.
It sounded very romantic.
Well, Mandy gets that way sometimes.
Silly, isn't she?
She'll be by the river
Where all heaven beams
And there by the river
We'll find the trail of dreams
Donkey, don't you dare...
Steady! Whoa! Whoa!
Dad!
Lucy!
Lucy! Hello, Logan.
Mommy.
Nice trip, Logan?
Did you enjoy yourself? Did you have a nice time, dear?
Yes, it was fun.
Oh, we stopped by the Dances and Mrs. Dance sends her hellos.
There she is, George, there's your girl.
Thank you, Logan.
Did he behave himself, Lucy?
Oh, you're lovely.
I'd almost forgotten.
Not entirely
I hope, George.
Is that the best you can do, George?
Could you do any better?
If I hadn't seen my girl for a whole month, a whole lot better.
Same old roughneck.
No polish at all.
Did you mind my asking Logan to bring you home?
What took you over to Crescent City, George?
A mining claim. Looked like a real strike, but it wasn't.
Another rainbow?
One day, I'll bring you the pot of gold from the end of that rainbow, you'll see.
Are you glad to be back, Lucy?
How was the trip?
Wonderful.
Good night.
Good night.
Where's Morrow?
He'll be back Tuesday.
I sent 40 mules on the trip.
Vane Blazier will take the
Scottsburg string in the morning,
20 mules.
Put this on the books, Clench.
Thirty mules to be at Salem on the 20th.
Henry McLane's freight.
Where will you get the mules?
You're spread pretty thin already.
Maybe it's time for us to buy a few more.
Buy, buy.
Always buy, buy.
Hello, Vane.
Did you stop by at Dances?
Yes.
How is everybody?
Caroline, you mean?
She's fine.
Do you realize you've got close on $50,000 sunk in this place?
We must be rich.
You ought to have $10,000 laid by for trouble.
What trouble? The trouble that always comes.
Why do you suppose I came here,
6,000 miles from Liverpool?
This is Jacksonville, Clench,
U.S.A. We sail with the tide.
All Americans think that.
They think the tide flows forever for them.
But mark me, Logan.
Gold veins run out, crops fail, men starve, wars come.
And businesses fail. Then we get a new deck and deal again.
So you'll buy the mules?
What happened to you, Logan?
We waited supper for you.
I thought you and George would want to be together.
Why, Logan, that's a very tender sentiment.
George, when is this girl going to marry you?
I doubt if she knows herself, Logan.
When are you taking me,
Lucy?
George, do you like poetry?
Must I like poetry to be your husband?
We will be married when the leaves fall.
You see, Logan. She strings me up and lets me swing.
You mean the maple leaves that fall early, or the pine needles that never fall at all?
Come on, there's a fight. Fight? Who is it?
I don't know.
What's going on?
There's a fight at the back of the settlement.
Come on!
You better get up there, Logan.
It's your friend
Vane Blazer and Bragg.
Come on, George.
Don't never crowd me, boy.
Nobody crowded you.
Oh, you're calling me a liar.
Stand up to him, Blazier.
Yeah. Let him have it.
I didn't call you a liar.
I'll bust you up proper, boy.
Having a little trouble, Vane?
Hello, Bragg.
Logan, my friend, how are you?
I hear you've been away.
I'm here and there,
I'm a restless man.
I've been away, too.
You have?
Well, you're a restless man like me.
I notice you're favoring your left leg.
A horse threw me.
It couldn't be you fell through a window by any chance?
Oh, let's get on with the fight.
See you sometime, Logan.
Well, by gum, it was a freeze out.
Come on, Vane, buy you a drink.
Never mind.
I can fight my own battles.
That was quite a surprise.
More of a disappointment to the boys, I'd say.
What can you expect from people living in the wilderness?
What's wilderness got to do with it?
Everything, I think.
What do you say, Lucy?
Some men are more primitive than others, I guess.
Some men just fight it harder.
Put his weight on Honey Bragg and he broke.
I'd say bent.
Well, broke or bent, what do you make of it, Hi?
You're a lawyer, Jonas, you figure it out.
I'm glad you enjoyed the trip, Lucy, but it's great to have you back.
I missed you.
Thank you, George.
Well, see you tomorrow.
You ought to do your kissing in private, George, and do it better.
I'll ask you again, Logan.
Could you do better?
You brought it on yourself, George.
Good night.
Good night, Lucy.
Going to play a little poker?
I got to get some sleep,
Oh, it's still early.
I'm off on a trip tomorrow. I'm going to look for some mules.
Another trip so soon?
If you're not careful, one of these days you're going to end up being a tired millionaire.
Then I'll take it easy.
See you when you get back.
Good luck.
I'm riding on a silver saddle
The moon is my silver saddle
And long before the stars skedaddle
I'll be with my love tonight
She'll be in the gloaming
Where all heaven beams
Oh, hello, Johnny.
Hi, Camrose.
Ah, say, I know it's after hours, but I saw a light in your office.
Mind letting me have my dust?
Got some poker to play.
Sure, Johnny, but I'll have to ask you to wait outside while I open the safe.
Company rules.
Sure, I know.
The moon is my silver saddle
And long before the stars skedaddle
I'll be with my love tonight
Me and my old Daisy, up there in the sky
And my heart beating crazy, but it's no wonder why
I'm riding on a silver saddle
To someone who loves me right
The moon is my silver saddle
I'm riding the moon tonight
Hello, Johnny.
How were things up the Applegate?
Oh, terrible.
All I got for my trouble was this watch.
Oh, I see.
Yeah, the dandiest thing. I found it hidden in an old Indian skull.
I'll trade you a good fiddle for it.
What would I want with a fiddle?
Well, all you can do with that is clock the time.
With a fiddle you can pass the time.
All right,
I'll trade you for that.
Oh no, not my Mandy.
Mmm-mmm, no.
Say, how long does it take to open a safe?
Come in, Johnny.
There you are, Johnny.
Much obliged, Camrose.
Glad to do it.
Good luck with your poker.
Heads.
Hello, Linnet.
Hello.
Coming up to Lestrade's?
Oh, maybe later.
Uh, you feeling lucky tonight?
I always feel lucky.
That's my trouble.
I'll see you.
King high straight.
Ace high.
It's too good for me.
And me.
That cleans me.
Of all the rotten luck.
You're a cleaned chicken, huh?
I'll have to give you my IOU, Jack.
With pleasure.
Marta, pen and ink for Mr. Camrose.
Too bad your friend Logan couldn't be with us tonight.
Oh, he's off on another trip tomorrow.
Always on the move.
I wish I had his energy.
He came near using some of it tonight on Bragg.
And Bragg backed down.
What did Logan want to butt in for?
Well, maybe he didn't want to see that young fellow butchered.
All you boys wanted to see was a fight. Ever consider that?
Better tell Logan to walk softly with Bragg.
Tell Bragg to walk softly.
Bragg is nothing but a low-down skunk.
Oh, come, Dr. Balance.
Honey Bragg's a sort of friend of mine.
You have strange friends, Jack.
Well, I didn't say that I like him or that I trust him.
What's your idea of a friend?
Any man, I suppose, who believes as I do that the human race is a horrible mistake.
Always damp. Always cold.
Isn't there any heat anywhere in the world?
Good night.
Coming my way, Howison?
Mmm.
Good night, Marta.
Coming, George?
I hear there's going to be a cabin-raising next week.
Whose?
Some young couple who apparently disagree with your husband's theories about perpetuating the human race. You'll come, won't you?
Why do you play so high when the cards are going against you?
Oh, I'll get it back.
Five or six good hands in a night.
Jack can't always be that lucky.
You're a fool.
Censure on your lips, solicitude in your eyes.
Is that really for me,
Marta?
You're always reading things in the way I look at you.
The things I'd like to read.
They're not there, George.
How's Lucy?
Adorable.
Good night, Marta.
Good night.
Hurry up!
There it goes!
There it goes!
There, I think that's wide enough.
That's big enough for anybody's fireplace.
Here's your other door.
You can get out either side in case you have trouble with the Indians or your woman.
Oh, Mrs. Dance,
I just can't get over it.
All these people coming from miles around, people we don't even know giving their time and all to build a house for Gray and me.
Yes, but don't forget it means a lot to them, too.
For sure. A neighbor, a new family starting up.
And another pair of hands to stand off those red beasters.
Hold up!
If you want to catch a man, you've got to work at it.
I want no man
I have to catch.
Why, sure. You catch him and he catches you.
A man always figures that he does the catching.
The truth is, it's the woman that brings him up on the rope, him not quite knowing it.
Is that the way you got Mrs. Dance?
Sure.
But she gave me the sign.
You've gotta give a man the sign.
Maybe that's so.
Whoa, boy.
Let's stroll down by the river.
I thought we came here to help, George.
Doesn't this scene of domesticity inspire you?
Not to sweat over a hammer and saw.
But it does inspire me to stretch out in the shade with my head on your lap.
This will be a handy place for your woodpile, Liza.
Oh, it's so peaceful here.
Mmm. The illusion of peace is upon it.
You sound rather jaded.
Oh, these cabin-raisings jade me.
People planting themselves in one rough spot for the rest of their lives.
I'm more for mansions and plush furniture.
What I wouldn't give right now to be in an expensive restaurant in Boston or New York.
Mmm, with music playing.
And you in a maroon waistcoat and me in an elegant green gown.
Ah, Lucy, there's so much of this world that we're missing.
Perhaps, George, if you took things a bit more seriously.
You mean like Logan?
Always figuring.
More stores, more mules...
What I mean is, if you didn't gamble so much.
This is a gambling country.
Everybody gambles.
Even Logan gambles, doesn't he, every time he sends out a pack train?
That's different.
Well, we're different.
He's not responsible for his character and neither am I for mine.
You know, I feel that sometimes you make a comparison between us that leaves me at a disadvantage.
George, don't complicate things.
Let's keep them simple and straight.
Mmm, my thoughts rarely travel in a straight line.
How about your affections?
My affections, always, where you're concerned Lucy.
Oh, George.
God bless the hands that built it, and the two that it was built for, and may they prosper and live in peace all the days of their lives.
Those whom God has joined together, let no man put asunder.
For as much as
Gray and Liza here have consented together in holy wedlock, and have witnessed the same before God and this company and thereto have given and pledged their troth each to the other,
I pronounce that they are man and wife.
In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.
Amen.
Now kiss her, son, and let's eat.
Where were you, Hi?
What kept you?
Well, the work all done?
Yeah, you timed it just right, Hi.
Cabin's all raised.
The couple's spliced and ready to raise a cabin full of young'uns.
Well, I couldn't find Mandy.
Soy bean.
Soy bean.
It's nice to have a place of your own and know your children'll grow up there.
If they're boys, I'd want them to take up land nearby.
If they're girls, I'd want them to marry neighbors and not move off.
When I'm dead, I'd like them to stand where I stood and see the things I saw.
Yes, but the man you get might not want to stay in one place.
Would it make you unhappy to move away?
It would be hard to be always fixing a new cabin and starting a new garden.
Do you like Jacksonville,
Logan?
It's a place to do business in.
Folks say you make money, but you're always risking it.
I never pay much attention to money.
And you're restless, everybody says so.
Yes, I guess I am.
It's easy to be that way if you've nothing to keep you home.
How about it, folks? Up on your feet. Grab a partner.
Sing it way up high like a robin in the sky
And tell them I'm getting married in the morning
Put all your cares aside, come and kiss the blushing bride
'Cause honey, I'm getting married in the morning
You ought to see who promised to be mine
Here you are, whiskey or water!
You can't dance without sweating!
Lift up your hearts and shout
So that the news will get about
'Cause, honey, I'm getting married in the morning
That's it now!
Sing it way up high like a robin in the sky
And tell them I'm getting married in the morning
We'll pass the little brown jug
But bring a fiddle and a mug
'Cause, honey, I'm getting married in the morning
Why you can hitch old Dobbin to the shay
And bring the family out for a lovely day, hey!
Lift up your hearts and sing when the church bells start...
What you want?
It's the same old story.
They don't mind us coming here.
It's like he says, mother earth is for all.
What they don't like is the cabin. That makes the land ours.
We got to live, too.
That's right.
Where's my boys?
We've been watching them, they got no guns.
Yeah, they got no guns.
Good boys.
Now you stay by me.
Better hit it up, boys.
What are you thinking, Logan?
Oh, I was just thinking of what you said awhile ago, the years ahead.
Caroline, do you like me well enough to make a marriage of it?
Yes, Logan, I do.
Caroline, it's time to pick up and go.
You're a good man, Logan.
And you've got a good girl.
Logan! Why that's great.
I know you'll be happy, Caroline.
Thank you, Lucy.
You see, there's nothing to it when you give him the sign.
Soy bean.
Soy bean.
Morning, Mr. Logan.
You're up early.
What's on your mind?
Let's have a drink.
It's too early.
I'm thirsty early or not.
Lots of places up the street.
Well, a drink's a drink.
I want you and Morrow to pull out for Salem this afternoon.
McLane's freight.
Thirty mules.
All right.
What's hit you, Vane?
Let's have it.
All right, I'll tell you.
She don't like big towns.
She don't like big ideas.
She don't like moving around and changing.
It's her choice.
You're not the man for her.
I'm sorry the way it turned out for you, Vane.
I didn't mean to bust out.
Let's load the boxes.
Bragg's up at Stutchell's.
They're all expecting you up there.
You might as well go.
The town won't have it any other way.
How about it, Logan?
You got a bet on this,
Johnny?
Yeah, a small one.
Which way?
Which do you think?
He'll get your eyes if he can.
Kill him and be done with it.
You too, Clench?
Come on, it's gonna be a slaughter.
He can't whip Bragg.
Nobody can.
How much have you got that says so?
I've got a hundred.
Well, put it up.
You want a hunk of this,
Linnet?
No, I'm not betting.
Did you ever see
Bragg's arms?
I seen him bust a two-by-four over his knee.
I seen him break four of Jed Peters' ribs.
He ain't got a chance.
Give me a bottle, Harry, a full one.
I left my gun home.
I brought mine along.
Let's make this a fair fight, Logan.
I've got nothing against you.
It's the boys that want the fun.
You're lying, Bragg.
What have you got against me?
You ought to know.
You're talking in riddles,
Logan. What's on your mind?
A picture of a tree, with you swinging from it.
You hear that, Stutchell?
Yeah. Yeah, I hear.
What's the matter, Harry?
Now you've got him.
Beat his brains out.
That's all right, Logan.
I'll get you in a minute.
That's all right, Logan.
I'll break your back.
Now, we can close in, Bragg.
You think I won't?
Now I've got you!
Over here, Bragg.
Over here.
Time to put out the light!
Dogs.
Yellow dogs.
You surprised me.
Oh, that was great, Logan!
Great!
Now you can collect your bet, Johnny.
He'll be after you the rest of your life.
Why didn't you kill him?
Would that have been more fun, Lucy?
That's what you all came for, isn't it? Excitement?
If that's the way you feel, you didn't have to fight him.
Sure,
I could have backed down and turned the whole town over to Bragg.
But all it meant to any of you is a show.
Logan! Look out!
You should take my advice and put some raw meat on those eyes.
They'll be all right.
It's just bruises.
Nothing I can do for you?
Yes, one thing.
Quit playing poker, George.
Quit poker? What for?
You can't afford it if you have to give out IOUs.
Poker's the only relaxation
I get around here.
Mighty expensive relaxation at $500 a throw.
George, what's got into you, lately?
Oh, I don't know.
It's just...
I'm sick of this godforsaken hole.
It's all right for you, you're rich. You've got your own business.
You're not gonna get rich at Lestrade's.
You'll end up owing him your shirt.
He's practically got it already.
George, are you in trouble?
How much do you owe?
Oh, at one place and another, a couple of thousand, maybe.
Let me have $2,000, Clench.
$2,000? What for?
Grubstake.
Grubstake.
So that's what you call it.
What's this?
Pay them off.
Just give me your word you'll quit, George.
Well, if you insist, but it'll be a mighty dull world.
Sure, but a man whose business is handling other people's money...
Must be above suspicion.
Yes, I guess you're right.
But I wish
I didn't have to take this.
Don't feel that way about it.
That's what friends are for.
Sure.
And long before the stars skedaddle
I'll be with my love tonight
She'll be in the gloaming
Where all heaven beams
And out there in the gloaming
We'll find the trail of dreams
I'm riding on a silver saddle
The moon is my silver saddle
And long before the stars skedaddle
I'll be with my love tonight
Me and my old Daisy
Up there in the sky
And my heart beating crazy
But it's no wonder why
Heads.
I wish I was 10,000 miles from this place.
It wouldn't make any difference, George.
You'd be the same wherever you were.
Wouldn't you miss me, Marta?
Why should I?
You've got Lucy.
Have I?
If you haven't, it's your own fault.
Of course.
But a woman is supposed to love a man because of his faults, isn't she?
Some women.
But not you?
Oh, Marta, don't be so hard.
Why can't we be friends?
Why?
Why can't you be a friend to yourself?
How are you, Camrose?
Mclver, what are you doing in town?
I just blew In.
I didn't expect you for another month.
Well, I didn't have any luck.
I just wore out shoe leather.
I'll buy you a drink.
Thanks. Thanks, I can't.
I'll see you tomorrow.
I want to get my dust out of your safe.
Sure. Any time.
Happy all of their lives
Hello, Mack! How are you?
Hello, Mclver.
How are you?
If you be happy
Don't ever wed
Just stay a free man
I gotta go home, fellows.
Oh, no, Mack.
Come on.
No, I gotta go home.
I gotta go home.
Come on, Johnny.
Let him go.
You don't know what you're missing, Mclver.
Don't ever wed
Till you are dead
If you be happy
Don't ever wed
Go away?
Leave Jacksonville? When?
Tomorrow, the day after, as soon as we can.
But why this sudden decision, George?
Nothing sudden. It's just that I'm fed up with this hole.
It's a place to strike it rich and if you don't, you should try your luck someplace else.
Luck doesn't depend on a place.
George, can't you be content here?
No, I can't.
Let's go in. You're upset.
Lucy, I'm going.
And you're going with me.
You promised to marry me, didn't you?
Yes.
Well, when?
Whenever you want.
Sunday, this Sunday.
Oh, no.
I'll have to make a dress.
Is a dress a marriage?
Lucy, when did you say?
Sunday?
As soon as she can make a dress.
Hello, Logan.
Hello, Lucy.
Well, George, I'm off to
San Francisco in the morning,
I stopped by to have a word with you in private.
Sure.
What's the matter, dear?
Nothing.
Is it true that you and George are really getting married?
Yes.
Oh, but why the haste?
George wants to go away.
But, dear...
Where are you to find material for a dress in this camp?
Yes, and besides, I always said that when my daughter got married, she'd have the finest wedding in the territory.
I'll even get the Governor to come down.
I'll tell you what.
Why don't you go along with Logan to San Francisco?
No.
Oh, but why not, dear?
There are any number of French dressmakers there.
I ought to knock your head off.
What's the matter?
You gave me your word you'd quit poker.
Yes, Logan, I did.
I had every intention of keeping it.
The devil tempted you,
I suppose.
Yes.
The devil with green eyes.
Envy.
Envy of you, Logan.
That's no answer.
Maybe it's the only answer.
But don't worry,
I'll pay you back.
I don't care about the money, George.
I do.
I'm pulling out, going someplace else and make a strike.
Pulling out and taking Lucy with you?
Lucy's my concern.
Not if you're going to make her life a thing of running and hunting.
Does she concern you that much?
Yes, she does.
I see.
Logan.
About San Francisco, would you mind having a woman on your hands?
Why, no.
I have to get a dress.
You'll be in good company, Lucy.
I'm starting early,
I have to stop at Dance's.
Aren't you staying for supper?
I can't.
I have something to do.
Why, hello, stranger.
How much did you take off
Camrose last night?
About 1,500 in gold, another 1,500 in a note.
I want it back.
You have a streak in you about Camrose.
For me, he's strictly a tinhorn.
Tinhorn or not,
I want the money back.
Look here, Logan, my business is cards...
You do too well at it.
If that money's not in Camrose's hands by the time I get back from San Francisco,
I'll come after you.
Where are you going?
Shut up!
What do you want? I thought it might interest you,
Logan Stuart's leaving for San Francisco.
Well, come on in.
Where are you bound for this time, Logan?
For San Francisco, to see if I can borrow some money.
Are you in trouble, Logan?
The trouble is my business, like young Asa here, always outgrowing his pants.
You're a moving around man,
Logan.
Well, the hound that rustles always catches the rabbit.
And there are hounds always lean and hungry from running too much.
Aimed at you, my boy.
I'm sure Logan didn't stop by here to see you wash dishes.
Is she going to San Francisco to borrow money, too?
Jealous?
Should I be?
No.
Logan, there's nothing to delay us, is there?
Not a thing.
When's it going to be?
Just as soon as I get back.
In a couple of weeks.
What's that?
Down.
He had to kill something.
We'd better hide the saddles and get out of here.
We'll have to make it back on foot.
Another hard time for you to remember.
That's what you wanted, wasn't it? Yes.
Then don't look at me like that.
Lucy, this is no good.
You're lying.
Logan, I want to get things straight between us before it's too late.
It's too late.
Maybe we can borrow a couple of horses at Elkton.
Well, I'm sorry about your wedding dress, Lucy.
Any dress will do.
What brought you back?
I ran into a little trouble, Clench.
Mmm. The world is rocking with trouble this morning.
Your world in particular,
Logan.
They've taken Camrose in for murder.
Murder?
Mack Mclver.
They found him drowned in the creek.
Looked like an accident at first.
But Johnny Steele and Hi
Linnet got to working on it.
Where is George?
They're holding court on him now up at Stutchell's.
And it grew on me that Camrose was tampering with the dust the boys left with the company.
He was losing a lot of money at poker...
That's hearsay,
Johnny.
What's wrong with hearsay if it's true?
Johnny, what have I got here?
A silver dollar.
Are you certain of it?
Dead certain.
Howison, what does it look like to you?
You're was time, Hi.
It's a plain old U.S. dollar.
Well, you're mistaken.
It's a Mexican dollar.
You see, Johnny? What you don't see yourself, you can't swear to be true.
You can't always swear that what you do see is true.
Well, anyway, Camrose was losing a lot of money at poker...
Hearsay, Johnny.
You're trying a man for his life.
Life is precious to all of you, isn't it?
Well, it's precious to George Camrose.
Life was good to Mclver, too, and it was took from him.
Was it? Well, that's what we're here to find out.
A murder trial calls for a proper judge and jury, doesn't it, Jonas?
They understand that.
Course we do.
Get on with it.
Lestrade.
Lestrade, did Camrose play poker with you?
Frequently.
Did he lose money?
Considerable.
How much would you say he lost?
In the course of a year, maybe $5,000.
Where did you get it from?
I won't say.
You've gotta say.
You can't compel an accused man to answer questions, Johnny.
That's the law.
If a man's innocent, why should he be afraid to answer questions?
Linnet, did you ever see Camrose take pokes out of the office safe and pour dust from one to the other?
Yes.
When?
It was the night before
Mclver was found in the creek.
I happened to see a light and
I looked through the shutter.
Do you make a habit of spying on people?
No, but I've got a habit of observing people.
Is that all you have to do?
Well, Logan, you've got a big store and no time, and I've got a little store and lots of time.
Order! Order!
Get on with it, Johnny.
All right.
Now, then,
Mclver came into town.
The next morning, he was found dead with his face in the creek.
We didn't find any dust on him, but we did find this, a receipt that Camrose gave Mack for his dust.
That's your writing, George?
Yes.
If you gave him his dust, why didn't you take back the receipt?
I seldom give receipts.
You remember, Johnny,
I never gave you one.
I just put your dust in the safe and when you asked for it, you got it.
It's been my usual custom, all you boys know that.
But Mclver wanted a receipt.
I merely forgot to ask for it when I gave him back his dust.
Careless, I'd say.
We're all careless with gold, it's the cheapest thing in camp.
Is that all, Johnny?
If so, it's not enough.
On the testimony of a man squinting through his shutter, you've tried to show that Camrose is dishonest.
And on the basis of an unreturned receipt, you deny he gave Mclver back his dust.
You've proved nothing.
Tell them, Linnet.
Well, he came into my store a couple of days ago and traded me a nugget, and I noticed it was shaped like a shamrock, so I put it in a box, set it up in my store for good luck.
Why, that's Mack's lucky piece. He always carried it.
Shamrock. That's Mack's.
I know that nugget.
That's it.
Sure, it was Mack's.
Well, there's the case,
Logan.
Twist it if you can.
Camrose could only have gotten that nugget at a time when Mack couldn't resist.
In other words, when Mack was dead.
I make murder out of that.
Let's vote on it.
Let's vote.
Just a moment.
Just a moment, all of you.
This meeting has no sanction.
If you vote this man guilty, you must still hold him over to a regular court.
Remember this.
Remember, if you vote this man dead on that set of facts, you'll be setting the scene for another day when you may be voting yourself dead.
Vote!
Vote!
Let's vote!
All those who think he's guilty, say so.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Hurray!
Did you know about the nugget? No.
They'll hang him tonight.
They'll just wait till it's dark.
You've done all you could, Logan.
Guilty.
Oh!
Dad, do you think he did it?
Well, he's a weak man.
Let's get along, Lucy.
Logan...
Lucy, Logan did everything he could.
Don't ask him to do any more.
Don't give us any trouble,
Logan.
It would be disagreeable, but disagreeable or not, we'd shoot you.
That's plain.
I'm glad you told me.
Don't do it, Logan.
You've done enough, haven't you?
No man has to go against reason.
Reason?
Is that what makes a man hungry?
Is it reason makes him fight or sends him in to
Stutchell's to have a drink or makes him stand by a friend?
What does make him, then?
Something deeper than reason.
The Indians have broken loose.
They've broken out.
How far did you come?
Well, I guess about 40 miles.
They're about 12 miles behind me here.
They are?
How far away are they?
They got their war paint on? Sure.
How big a party?
George, pull on the door.
Here. Take the black horse in my barn.
Watch your chance, get up to the hills and keep going.
Thanks, Logan.
Thanks for your confidence.
Don't flatter yourself.
What are you doing this for?
For Lucy's sake?
You don't want her to see me strung up, is that it?
Something like that,
I guess.
Everything's on fire all along the line.
My wife's dead and my little girl's dead.
How many Indians did you see?
Big band? Little band?
What made them break out?
I couldn't say for sure.
The ferry man said it was on account of Honey Bragg killing an Indian girl.
Which way are they heading?
Toward Dance's.
A man ought to be tougher than that.
That's a fool remark,
Johnny.
We'll have to raise a company.
Sixty men or more.
Count me in.
Me, too.
I'll go.
On that mule?
She can run. Well, you better stay here just in case.
Come on, let's go.
Just in case they head this way.
He's gone. He broke out.
Broke out? How?
He busted the lock.
Why didn't you watch him?
I warned you, Logan.
You're making long guesses again, Johnny.
Whoever's going, be here in 20 minutes.
Grub enough for three days.
We'll take care of you later, Logan.
There.
Now you can let it down.
There we are.
Liza, you're just about the best little helper a man ever had.
Oh.
All right.
How big an outfit was it, Logan?
Thirty mules. I wonder if
Morrow and Blazier got away.
Hello!
We were jumped, Logan,
Morrow was killed.
How are things here?
Bad.
Mr. Dance is dead and young Asa, too.
Where's Caroline?
She's gone.
She's up in the brush hunting a cow.
I found her trail, but I couldn't follow it.
I'll have coffee for you all in a little while.
We'll take you up to the ferry,
Mrs. Dance. It'll be safer.
No, I wouldn't...
I wouldn't feel easy under foot in another woman's house.
Well, what kind of dress was Caroline wearing?
Gingham.
Blue and white checked.
Did she have a gun?
I...
I don't recollect.
There was firing all around while the red beasters were here.
My Ben was killed right off.
It was him
I was thinking about, not anybody else.
Caroline was out looking for that no horn cow.
She's a breechy creature, always knocking down the fence and some kind of grass up in the canyon that she yearned for.
Who's that? Sing out!
Hey!
I'm coming in.
Stay where you are!
I'm dead beat.
Do you want me hanging from a tree skinned and dressed?
You got nothing coming to you.
I'm coming in.
Logan!
Hey!
Come here, quick.
Caroline's.
Caroline.
Caroline.
How are they all?
Mrs. Dance is all right.
Ben?
He's dead, Caroline.
So is Asa.
Caroline.
I want all of you to come back to
Jacksonville. Put up at my place.
I wouldn't want to do that.
You'll be doing it soon.
I don't want to leave here, Logan.
I can never be a town woman again.
I could never be a woman moving around.
I... I'd disappoint you.
It came to me last night.
We're not the same.
And then today, when you found me, you and Vane,
I was sure.
I want to look out of the window and see my man plowing.
And in the evening, see him in the kitchen rocker.
You're thinking of Vane.
I'm thinking I'm not hurting you too much, Logan.
And as time went by, I'd be hurting you, is that it?
That's it.
Caroline, crying helps some people a lot.
Some people it doesn't help.
You folks all right?
Oh, yes.
But what about the Dances?
They were hit pretty bad.
Ben and little Asa were killed. Oh, and Caroline?
Caroline's all right.
Well, didn't you bring her back with you? It's dangerous where she is.
She didn't come.
She doesn't like towns.
Well, she'd better get to like them if she's marrying you.
She's not.
She's marrying Blazier.
Well, what did I tell you?
About what?
About the trouble that always comes.
And your Crescent pack string was destroyed over in the Applegate.
The Scottsburg outfit's gone, too.
Blazier got clear.
You know how you stand,
Logan?
You're broke.
This is what you lent Camrose.
Where is he?
Indians get him?
No, one of the boys.
Never mind which one.
There was a lot of good in George.
Yeah, he sure panned out no color.
It's a thin margin, Johnny, between what could be and what is.
Yeah.
It was thin for you last night.
We were a mind to hang you.
Lucy.
You see how thin the margin is.
Did you know about this?
Yes.
In some other kind of country, he might have made the grade.
There's not much left, is there?
Not much.
Well, Logan, now you haven't got any store, but you've got lots of time.
I guess I'll have to make that trip to San Francisco after all.
See if I can rustle up some credit.
Want some company?
If you can keep up on that mule.
I'll see you.
When are you leaving?
In the morning.
Logan, would you mind having a woman on your hands?
Oh, buttermilk sky
Can't you see my little donkey and me?
We're as happy as a Christmas tree
Heading for the one I love
I'm gonna pop her the question
That question
Do you, darling?
Do you, do?
It'll be easy, so easy
If I can only bank on you
Oh, buttermilk sky
I'm telling you why
Now you know, keep it in mind tonight
Keep brushing those clouds from sight
Oh, buttermilk sky
Don't you fail me when I'm needing you most
Hang a moon above her hitching post
Hitch me to the one I love
Yes, sirree!
As soon as I strike oil, that's what
I'm gonna get me. An automobile!
Oh, you can't depend on them things.
I'm gonna get me a gal with yellow hair.
He's only a dirt monkey.
Now, I'm a real sky hooker.
Peanuts, popcorn, cigars and cigarettes.
That ain't nothin'.
I heard someone made $78,000 in minutes over an oil lease.
Jim Gardner says these railroad trains will run on oil instead of coal.
You hear about them Wright brothers that flew that plane?
Oh, I don't believe that.
Tickets! Show your tickets.
This is an outrage.
Why don't you put on more cars?
We do. These oil workers keep filling them.
Don't blame the railroad, blame Jim Gardner.
You've got a chance to get in on an oil boom that'll make the land rush look petty.
- Here, read this.
- Did you hear that, Ellie?
Yes, but you know about wheat.
You don't know about oil.
What's there to know, except it's in the ground?
Sign with Gardner today and get paid.
$10 a day - your chance to be a millionaire.
- Ain't that worth taking a chance?
- I guess so. Just as you say.
- I'll raise you a month's pay.
- Which you ain't got.
- Which I'll get and a million more.
- You tell him!
- If Gardner can do it, so can I.
- I could use his luck.
I could use that million in his bank.
I'd be satisfied with his private car.
Help yourself. It's right behind us!
- But Mr Gardner wanted to see me.
- Him in conference.
Hey, conference over.
You wanted to see me?
You got a telegraph office in Cleveland?
Yes, but we're there only a minute.
That's not time enough.
I've these wires to send.
We've a schedule to make.
Make it up later, if you're smart.
All right, Mr Gardner.
Anything you say.
- Always get what you want, Jim.
- That's right.
But you don't always want what you can get, do you?
Look, honey, I'm very busy.
You'd better go up with your friends.
(Conductor) All out for Cleveland station.
All out.
- All out?
- Mm-hm.
All out.
(Man) All aboard!
(Second man) Plenty of room here!
- If you wanna be a millionaire!
- Be a millionaire!
There's plenty of room!
- Can we get a drink?
- No, it's a flag stop.
(Man) Wait, Cathy.
(Woman) Oh, here, take this, please!
- You don't have to leave.
- Walter, I'll miss my train.
- You can live this down.
- I don't want to! I want to live!
Listen to her, the shameless hussy!
You promised you'd never speak to that woman again!
Mother, that's not the charitable attitude.
Faith, hope and charity won't help her.
I don't want help.
Get out of my way!
That's exactly how I feel.
Pardon me, ladies.
(Walter) I'm sure
I can make you understand.
- Here, pop, take these wires.
- Hold your horses.
James E Gardner!
Oh, yes, sir! Right away, Mr Gardner!
Who's the beautiful sinner?
Why, that's Catherine Allen.
She wrote this here book.
Spicier than a pickled apple.
(Woman) I'll circulate a petition.
(Second woman) We'll all sign it.
Say you're sorry, and you'll never write another book.
- They'll forgive you.
- But I'm not sorry!
And don't think you're pinning any scarlet letter on my repentant bosom!
Wait.
In spite of everything,
I'll... l'll marry you.
Walter! You'd do that for me?
- Yes.
- She will never call me mother.
Oh, Walter!
Very interesting. I'd better read this.
Oh, Cathy!
You brazen creature!
You... you!
Jezebel's the word.
Oh, don't worry, Mrs Ames.
I wouldn't marry him if he were the last man on earth.
Wild horses couldn't keep me here.
- Let them have it!
- Now you're talkin'!
Don't think you're running me out.
I'm leaving of my own free will.
I'm going where people know it's the 20th century.
- Where there are broad minds.
- (Conductor) Aboard!
I'm going to stand on my own feet!
- Not if you miss this train, honey.
- Free from all you ostriches!
- (Laughing)
- Who are you?
- You always leave town like this?
- First time I've been carried out.
- This is my pleasure.
- Well, I can take care of myself.
You bet you can.
Ooh, Christmas!
Allow me, if I'm not too old-fashioned.
Thank you.
Hiya, chicken! Where'd you come from?
Boys, your seats.
Here comes Kerry Nation.
There must be at least one gentleman in this coach.
Well, this is the 20th century, when women stand on their own feet.
- Here's a seat, honey!
- Let go of me!
I hear you wanted broad horizons.
Ain't this broad enough?
Oh... thank you.
(Man) Who was that?
(Second man) Jim Gardner.
Come along.
- This IS private, isn't it?
- And very convenient.
- Sit, make yourself comfortable.
- Thank you.
Why don't you take off your hat?
You have those new flat records!
Mm-hm.
"A Woman Dares".
- Oh, you know?!
- Everything.
Catherine Allen.
What shall I call you? Catherine?
Katie? Kitten, that's it.
- Kitten?
- Sure. A baby wildcat.
Well, who are you?
Just a guy opening up some oilfields around Sapulpa.
Are you James E Gardner?
That's right.
You know, you owe a lot to me.
From the look on that fella's face after you kissed him, he wasn't gonna let you go, and I don't blame him.
What's that for?
Why does a woman usually slap a man?
You are a wildcat!
I'm not as wild as you think.
- (Door thudding)
- Oh!
Wait, you know there are no seats up ahead.
I didn't think you'd mind that.
- I know I didn't.
- Get out of my way!
I'm no Jezebel!
I'm not even a good imitation of one.
I'm a schoolteacher.
A schoolteacher?
If you don't stop laughing,
I'll slap you again.
Sorry. I thought you knew something about life.
How could I know anything about life?
I've never lived... except in books.
I've never been anywhere except in books.
All I've ever known is books, books, books!
But didn't you write one?
- Yes, in self-defence!
- And now where are you going?
Kansas City, so I can experience the things I've been writing about.
So people can't say
"schoolteacher" the way you did.
Of all places, why Kansas City?
Because my Aunt Clara's there.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Come on back, and give me a chance to square myself.
You can't learn much about life from an aunt in Kansas City.
Come to my town, Sapulpa.
I'll show you more there in five minutes than you'll ever see in Kansas City.
- (Music off)
- You oughta go to school.
Let someone else be the teacher.
- (Train brakes squealing)
- Oh!
Oh. Excuse me.
Guess I should've knocked.
- What is this? A hold-up?
- Just for a seat, mister.
- You can't flag down this train!
- I know it.
- Well, why'd you do it?
- My horse died under me.
- And I figured...
- You figured what?
Figured I'd carried this saddle far enough.
- Now, look, honey.
- (Train wheels squealing)
Oh, wait! There aren't any seats up ahead.
He's walked miles.
You can't let an ex-soldier stand.
Oh, you noticed the pants.
Why, it's your duty as a citizen.
Mr Gardner, does he stay or go?
The young lady would feel happier if he stayed.
That's real patriotic of you, ma'am.
Well, where are you going?
You know, I was arguing that out with my horse just before he died.
Whether I'd go back around Sapulpa and punch cattle again, or wait till my money run out.
- Where do you want to go?!
- Where are you goin'?
Yes, where ARE you going?
- Kansas City.
- Kansas City.
- You violated rule number three.
- I did?
By rights, I shouldn't let you ride on this train.
As long as Mr Gardner will put up with you, it'll be all right.
- Well, thanks.
- That's very generous of you.
Somebody sure is, judging from this lunch box.
- Anybody mind?
- No, go right ahead.
You folks pick up right where you left off.
That's one thing about these big hats.
If you really want to live, you mustn't be afraid to take a chance.
You've got to learn to leap first, look afterwards.
That's what happened to my horse.
Broke his neck.
As you were saying.
Don't be afraid to take a chance.
You've gotta play for high stakes.
Before we struck oil in my town, it was a dust-covered prairie with farmers trying to squeeze a living out of the ground when all the while there was a fortune under their feet.
You're gonna have to excuse me, mister.
It's this book!
- What's so funny?
- Listen to this.
"They kissed,
"and the sun and the moon and the stars reeled around them."
Them two could've started quite a conflagration.
An author is entitled to poetic licence.
Oh, nobody's entitled to run that hog wild.
That's no way to treat good literature.
If you want to find out what the author meant, read from the beginning.
Fine. But I don't think it'll do much good.
- "Julie stood at the crossroads."
- Julia!
Yes, ma'am.
"Julia stood at the crossroads.
"Which way?
One road led to John and dull security.
"The other to Roger Hale and exciting adventure."
He's ruining it.
Read to yourself, if you don't mind.
Oh.
I've known plenty of women.
I never asked any of them what I'm asking you.
Get off at Sapulpa with me.
If my hunch about us is right, you're not going to be sorry.
And if it's wrong, there's always another train to Kansas City.
- Oh, but I couldn't.
- Why not?
Aren't you Catherine Allen?
The novelist? Woman of means?
Yes, but...
Well, if someone else were with me, I...
- Not alone.
- You won't be alone.
- I promise you.
- But I wouldn't dare.
Oh, I can't stand any more of this.
I'll bet whoever wrote that book is some dried-up old maid who'd run a mile if a man looked at her.
Is that your opinion?
Yeah.
You know, I once had the idea that she was warm, beautiful and courageous.
But I guess you're right.
(Conductor) Next stop
Sapulpa Junction!
Here we are, boss. Home.
Well, they'll be switching my car off here, so if you folks are going on to Kansas City, you'd better move on up ahead.
Looks like we're at the crossroads.
How did it go in your book?
"One road led to John and dull security, and the other to..."
- (Conductor) Sapulpa Junction!
- That's right.
Well... this is where I get off.
Goodbye.
(Man) Howdy, Jim!
We, uh... better get going.
Isn't it wonderful?
Well, did you hear what the man said?
They're switching this caboose off here.
Hey, sorrel top, they'll be switching this coach off.
There's so much noise,
I can hardly hear you.
- (Conductor) Aboard!
- Come on!
(Man) Come on, step this way for your golden opportunity!
Get rich by staking your field!
Only a few left.
(Conductor) All aboard!
Your hands aren't gonna get chapped just going to the next car.
Only hired girls put on their gloves in public.
They're cutting off the coach!
- (Train horn blowing)
- I'm ready now.
Take your time.
Oh, good heavens!
I've missed my train!
Well, I never saw a better job of missing one.
Well, you might have warned me.
My throat's raw from warning you.
That's very strange. I'm not deaf.
Lady, I... I...
I should've warned you.
You most certainly should have.
I'm not a mind-reader, you know.
Why, there's Mr Gardner!
Well, ain't that unusual!
(Man) Why don't you get a horse?
Oh, hurry, Mr Gardner. That gusher ain't gonna wait for nobody.
The hotel coach is pulling out.
Please don't bother about me.
- I can look out for myself.
- I don't know.
My granny always says, next to eating with a sharp knife, there's nothin' so risky as a pretty girl looking out for herself.
Your granny and I don't agree!
Mr Gardner! Mr Gardner!
- Why, Kitten, what happened?
- The most terrible thing.
I was hurrying off your private car when suddenly, without any warning, the train pulled off and left me.
That's wonderful. Get in here.
I was hoping that would happen.
- What will I do?
- Just don't worry.
There'll be another train in a few days.
Until then, you're going to school.
Your teacher's going to be
James E Gardner, PE.
- PE?
- Uh-huh.
Practical experience.
Twist her tail, Cherokee.
- Is it safe?
- Runs like a deer.
Noisy snorting gasoline monster!
Consarn your death-claimed gasoline buggy!
Take her easy, Despirit!
There ain't nobody gonna...
Daniel.
Daniel Somers, you young coyote!
Hoist yourself up here!
- What are you doing back here?
- Hiya, Despirit.
I ain't seen you since we turned that stagecoach over.
Where you been keeping yourself?
Well, Cuba and the Philippines.
Say, uh... what's going on around here?
- You ain't gonna like it no more.
- No?
Cattle's gone, sheep's come in,
James E Gardner struck oil.
Get this thing to the blacksmith's shop.
OK, boss.
And the lady's luggage in my car - take it to the hotel.
Sorry, but if you folks are going into town, better get another coach.
Now, just a min...
- Hi, Mr Gardner.
- I'm using this one.
This'll take care of you.
I'm sure you don't mind.
- Come along, Kitten.
- Thank you.
Regular lollapalooza.
Yep, sure got all his buttons on.
Despirit, straight to my oilfield, and use the whip.
Har! Hup!
What are you aiming to do around here, Daniel?
Remember that wild pinto
I was chasing for a couple of years?
Yep, but you got him.
It's a sorrel I'm after this time.
You're on your way to a thrill you'll never forget.
I'm... l'm almost sure of that.
I'll stake my life on it.
Give me them reins. Hiyah!
Hey, Despirit! Take it easy!
Hiyah! Hiyah!
Whoa!
Whoa!
- Hold it!
- You're fired!
Can't be fired. I ain't been hired.
She's a header!
She'll be bustin' through any second!
Hello. You hear that cat purr?
- She's gonna blow in.
- Yeah.
Why aren't those tools under that casing?
- The cables are fouled!
- Get up there, free 'em.
Then be blown up with it?
I want those tools out now!
Stand by to hoick them.
Liked it the way it was.
Stuff sure smells, don't it?
It smells of life and love and freedom.
It smells beautiful.
Well, to me, it just smells.
All clear! Take 'em away!
Clear off.
Here she comes!
Yes, sir, that proves it.
Right on a straight line.
- Yeah, the Indian lands.
- Right.
And that's where the big pool is.
And that's where you're gonna spot in my next well.
There are millions over there.
You'd better shut her in.
All right, men.
Let's put this kitten to bed.
He's turning this into a throbbing new world!
Yeah? Well, I liked it the way it was.
Before he got it all messed up.
Great work, Rich.
See you in town tonight.
Biggest one yet, eh, Wilkins?
- And, by rights, it's part mine.
- What do you mean yours?
Everything I had went into this well.
This was my land.
You didn't lose it running out of money.
You lost it because you haven't got guts for oil.
I'd have sucked it out before selling.
Look, Mr Gardner,
I don't know what's legal, but I'm getting what's coming to me!
I'm sick of hearing you cry.
I gave you fellas jobs.
Collect your pay and get off my land.
Your land? It's your land, according to law.
And nobody can take it away from you!
Well, I can!
Cos if the way you got it is legal, so's this.
Thanks, cowboy.
What's the big idea?
You really didn't want to catch that little fella, did you?
I ought to break his neck. Yours too.
I got no steady side in this fight.
When he had a gun and you didn't, that was unfair.
So what?
So when you took out after him with 75 pounds, which he ain't got, that was taking a little advantage too.
You're asking for this.
I'm gonna break your thick skull.
Oh, please, Mr Gardner!
After all, he did save your life.
All right, Kitten, you can consider you saved his life.
Now get out of town, cowboy, before I change my mind.
Go on.
Please, go!
I wish you'd make up your mind.
A while ago you wanted me to stay, now you want me to go.
Oh... my!
Things are happening so fast, it's like a... a two-ring circus!
You've only seen the sideshow out here.
You'll have to wait till we get in town for the main event.
I hope you won't be lonesome.
I'm riding up front.
I have some business with Despirit.
Of course. Business comes first.
We can talk later.
What are you doing in here?
Well, I was never one for walking.
Besides, I owe you my life.
What would you like to do with it?
I'll give it right back to you, and some advice with it.
Open the door and jump out.
Don't worry about me, lady.
As my granny always says...
I'm not interested in your grandmother's old-fashioned ideas.
Hey, she ain't so...
You'd be surprised how modern she is.
She's three jumps ahead of your favourite author.
I'm willing to pay you.
Just because you smoked a peace pipe, don't hold me up.
Then I'm dumber than you think or you ain't as smart as I think you are.
All right, Despirit, you win.
Arrange a powwow with Big Tree for tomorrow.
Just a plain introduction?
- Just how plain?
- Oh, howdy, couple of OKs.
How much to say what a great guy I am?
That'll cost you money.
If I'm stretching the truth,
I've got to get paid.
I've got a very delicate conscience.
(Laughing) Despirit, you're a burglar.
I'll add 200 and make it 1,000 for a class-A introduction.
Giddy-up, boy.
(Man) Congratulations, Lucky.
This ought to make you a multimillionaire.
Thanks, boys. Sapulpa will be one of the biggest towns in the southwest.
I'll be paying out more money...
Suppose you start paying me for my coach, Mr "Lucky" Gardner?
Despirit! Are you working for me or for him?
What do you mean by letting my carriage trade walk?
Now, Bessie, before you get all het up, let me explain.
It's my fault. I have with me a distinguished author.
An author of what is destined to become a classic.
- "A Woman Dares".
- (Man) Sounds exciting!
I'm sure you'll be as impressed by the honour as I am.
When people of this calibre visit Sapulpa, it means we're growing up.
I don't know what to say.
I'm sure your granny could think of something apropos.
This is where I get out.
(Gardner) It is my privilege to present our distinguished guest...
I told you to leave town.
I couldn't get out till I got in, could I?
This is our distinguished guest -
Miss Catherine Elizabeth Allen.
(Bessie) Welcome to Sapulpa.
(Catherine) Thank you.
Well, just goes to show, you can't judge a book by its cover.
That's what my granny should've said.
Bessie, meet Daniel Somers, a friend of mine.
That ain't gonna help him get a room.
I'm full up.
Wait a minute.
He tripped up Big Jim Gardner, throwed him right on his face.
Well, pleased to meet you, son.
Fix him up with a room.
Come here, Daniel.
Get to the bar.
Say, this is real elegant.
Yeah. Finest in the territory.
(Jim) Bessie!
- Miss Baxter, Miss Allen.
- How do you do?
- Pleased to meet you.
- I'm leaving Miss Allen with you.
- Take care of her, won't you?
- Sure.
I suppose she'll have the guest room?
Naturally. The best.
Cherokee, did you bring the luggage?
Everything here, boss.
- Max. Number three.
- Yes, ma'am.
Thank you.
Hope you'll be comfortable.
I'm sure I will be.
Get all dressed up, Kitten.
Tonight we're hitting the high spots.
- The main event.
- That's right.
(Bessie) Come along.
- Cherokee, get my bath ready.
- All right, boss.
(Bessie) Come on, dearie.
Gee, it's stale in here.
I'll open the window, let some fresh air in.
Ah! That's better.
Uh, pretty classy, ain't it?
I... l've never seen anything like it.
You bet your life.
I've done all the decorating myself.
- It's lovely, Mrs Baxter.
- Oh, call me Bessie.
I'll help shake out your things.
They get messy in a bag.
Ooh, my, but that's heavy.
(Laughing) What have you got in here?
Some gold bricks?
Almost as valuable.
Copies of my book.
How'd you get started, dearie?
I was bored, I guess.
That'll do it... every time.
Just off the farm?
- Schoolteacher.
- Come again?
Schoolteacher.
That's what I thought you said.
Better come along with me.
Maybe you'd like to take a look at the er... principal's office.
I don't get it, honey.
Neither did he until I slapped his face.
- You slapped Jim Gardner's face?
- I did.
- And you're here?
- I certainly am.
Come on, honey, and sit down.
I've got to hear this from the beginning.
# Oh, the moon shines tonight on pretty Red Wing
# The breeze is sighing
# The night bird's crying...
(Jim) Oh!
# For afar 'neath the star her love is sleeping
# While Red Wing's weeping
# Her heart away
(Jim) Very pretty.
(Daniel) Thanks.
The steers always liked it.
You made a big mistake today.
Yeah? How come?
There isn't a man in town that wouldn't want to be indebted to me.
Maybe somebody else can take a shot at you and we'll start again.
You're just lucky
Cherokee wasn't there.
Or both you and Wilkins would be dead.
Not unless he can handle a gun better than that buggy today.
- Maybe you like to find out, eh?
- Cherokee, scrub my back.
Oh, he does that too.
Anyway, you did me a favour.
I'll give you $100 to get out of town.
You sell your life pretty cheap, don't you?
All right, make it $200.
I'm kind of afraid to pick up money that easy.
Might turn into one of them tycoons.
So here I am.
- You told him all about yourself?
- Everything.
He still asked you to get off?
Why, he begged me too.
Either he's getting older or dumber, or you're the one.
Of course, he thinks I missed my train but... confidentially, I didn't.
I wouldn't want him to think
I'd get off a train without a chaperone.
- Without what?
- A chaperone.
- Someone like my Aunt Clara.
- Listen, honey.
Your Aunt Clara couldn't even sit in on a game like this.
This requires the services of a professional.
Meet a new member of your family - Aunt Bessie.
Oh, Bessie. You're wonderful.
Come on, now, cards on the table.
You're crazy about the big guy, ain't you?
You know, I wrote about him even before I met him.
He's exactly like
Roger Hale in my book.
"He led her into a new world filled with exciting adventures..."
And they got married and lived happy ever after?
- Well, of course.
- You got the right idea.
But I've got to warn you, kid, when you're shooting for orange blossoms with Jim Gardner, you're playing for high stakes.
That's what he told me to do.
(Cherokee) Hey, take 'em off, clothes.
Hey, you. Take 'em off, clothes!
- You hear me?!
- I'm looking at the flickers.
(Jim) I don't like my clothes on you.
Don't you think they're becoming?
No, they're too big for you.
You figured you owed me $200.
I thought this was a bargain.
Are you gonna taken them off or does Cherokee take over?
Do you mean here?
- Now?
- You heard the boss.
Well, I guess you'll have to excuse me, ladies.
- Do you want a job?
- Yep.
You've got one.
Cherokee, you're fired.
- I didn't say I wanted his job.
- Well, do you?
- These duds go with it?
- Mm-hm.
Maybe it'd be all right.
So long as I don't have to wash your back.
Starting by throwing him out.
You heard the boss. Vamoose!
I'll wait for you in the lobby,
Kitten, eight o'clock.
- I'll be ready.
- Don't forget. We'll be waiting.
After you, boss.
Kitten, you're gorgeous.
You take my breath away.
You leave me a little breathless too.
It's good enough for me.
- Good evening, Mr Gardner.
- Mrs Walden.
Open them gates.
- Bonsoir, Monsieur Gardner.
- Good evening, Pierre.
We've held the performance.
Your table is directly centre.
- Not too near the orchestra, I hope.
- No. You'll love it.
- (Man) Good evening, Mr Gardner.
- Nice to see you.
(Daniel) Thanks, Kelsey.
Oh... er...
Here's one for you, boss.
What are you doing here?
Looking out for your interests.
(Jim) Were you invited?
If I'm gonna be on the job,
I oughta stay close.
- Come on. Get out.
- You want me to go?
Definitely.
I can take a hint.
Why the extra glasses?
We hoped you might honour us with your famous champagne trick.
- No, not tonight.
- Oh, please do.
Anything to make you happy.
You see, the object is to fill four glasses at the same time...
...without moving the bottle.
That'd even be prettier with goldfish.
- Jealous?
- Mm-hm.
Me too.
- It's like another world.
- And here's to its queen.
# We have two eyes
# Two lips
# Two arms
# And we have love to burn
# Which way shall we turn?
# Put your arms around me, honey
# Hold me tight
# Huddle up and cuddle up with all your might
# Oh, babe, won't you roll those eyes?
# Eyes that I just idolise
# When they look at me my heart begins to flow
# Then it starts a-rockin' like a motor boat
# Oh, oh, I never knew
# Any boy like you
# Put your arms around me, honey
Hold me tight
# Huddle up and cuddle up with all your might
# Oh, oh, honey
# Won't you roll your eyes?
# Eyes that I just idolise
# I really do
# When they look at me my heart begins to flow
# Then it starts a-rockin' like a motor boat
# I know I could be true
# To only one
# Only one?
# Maybe two
# Maybe two?
# Maybe four and maybe more
# If they were all like you
# And you and you... #
Hey, legs is pretty things, ain't they?
- Al Dalton!
- Dan!
Hasn't the marshal caught up with you yet?
Me and the progressive citizens made a deal.
When the marshal's in town, they hoist a white flag and I stay out, and vice versa.
# Put your arms around me, honey, hold me tight
# Before we say good night
Say, er, it's been rumoured that you're getting soft-hearted.
Yeah? Who started that?
Well, you could do me a charitable act.
Yeah?
You know Jim Gardner?
Give me that gun, Dalton!
- Gardner asked for this!
- Take it easy, Al!
Let me loose! He's a double-crossing liar and a cheap crook.
- He is not cheap.
- Keep out of this, cowboy.
I won't. Supposin' he is a big mouth?
Nobody's gonna shoot him while I'm around.
Get him out of here, Despirit.
Did you hear what he said?
He might've killed you, Jim.
I don't understand it.
I always played ball with the boys.
Tried to warn you, but you're too trustin'.
That fella meant business and he ain't alone.
This is no soft job I walked into.
- Sit over here, will you?
- Oh, no. Not me.
My granny always said it's downright unpolite to shoot across the lady.
- It's me, honey.
- (Catherine) Come in.
I brought you a hair of the dog that bit you.
My favourite pick-me-up.
How you feeling?
Oh, like I was floating on a cloud.
Come on, baby.
Tell me all the exciting incidents.
What did he say?
I'm beautiful. He told me so.
- Where'd he go from there?
- I'm different. He said that too.
- With gesture?
- Uh-huh.
- I confuse him.
- Are you sure of that?
He's never met anyone like me before.
I'm sure of that.
Ah, you're convincing me, baby.
Where is he, Bessie?
Up on the reservation in a powwow.
You better brush up on your sign language.
- How.
- (Laughing)
(Chief speaking
Native American language)
(Despirit) This is Mr Gardner and his lawyer, Mr Fenton.
- Mason, the Indian Agent.
- Howdy. Glad to know you.
That's Richardson, his head driller.
And Daniel, Daniel Somers.
(Chief speaking
Native American language)
Oh, yes. Big Tree, this is Jim Gardner.
Great white chief of Sapulpa.
He asked for a powwow.
Him like big wind.
He speak - grass, trees, rabbit - everything go.
Big man. Powerful.
Very sharp like knife.
That's a thousand-dollar introduction.
(Big Tree) White chief speak.
Big Tree, your tribe owns much land.
From the rock of the wide moon to the sleeping mountain.
- Hmm.
- This land has only trees and rocks.
Not good for grain. Buffalo gone now.
Deer will soon go.
Your sons will be poor.
(Laughing) Scare you?
No.
Mr Mason, you have our offer in writing.
(Mason) That's right.
(Fenton) We agreed to give the Indians
12.5o/o of every dollar.
That's thousands of dollars a day if you just sign the agreement.
What do you think?
What you think, little man with beard?
Who, me? Oh, I ain't much on thinking.
You better ask Daniel there.
Daniel's the thinkingest man
I ever knowed.
What you say, my son?
- I wish you hadn't asked me that.
- Speak up, Daniel.
I think you'd be suckers.
(Chief) Suckers?
What a squirrel is when he lets the woodpeckers steal the nuts he stored up for the winter.
Our friend has spoken.
What do you expect out of this?
Not a raise in pay.
My son, we will sign papers with you.
I don't want the deal.
I ain't in the oil business.
You bet you're not.
Not even on the ragged edge.
This doesn't settle a thing, Big Tree.
I'll work the oil even if I have to go to Washington.
- Come on.
- I'd better ride in the back.
Oh, Jim. It's beautiful.
There are the Indian lands.
I heard about your losing them.
I'm terribly sorry.
Thanks. But I haven't lost them.
Tomorrow I'll make Big Tree another offer.
I'll go direct to Washington.
What I want I get.
I'll be on that train tomorrow night.
- Won't I?
- That's right.
I do hope my ticket's been validated correctly.
Let me see.
It would be awful if I were left behind again.
- Wouldn't it?
- Yes, it would.
Why, Jim...
You didn't really think
I'd let you get away, did you?
I wasn't sure.
I'm crazy about you. You know it.
I wasn't going to use the ticket anyway.
You don't need one on my train.
I'm the conductor and the engineer too.
And every place you've ever dreamed of will go spinning past the window of our private car -
Chicago, New York, London...
...Paris.
I don't care whether we go to the moon or whether we stay right here as long as we're always together.
- Always?
- For ever.
I have an idea you'll be able to hold me for a long time.
But wherever that place is along the line, when you get tired of the scenery, just let me know.
Is that the only way we can travel?
It's the way I travel.
I promise you won't be the loser.
I'm sure I won't be the loser...
...because this is where I get off!
Hey, wait a minute!
Kitten, come back here.
(Daniel) # Oh, the moon shines tonight on pretty Red Wing
# The breeze is sighing
# The night birds crying
# For afar 'neath his star her love is sleeping
# While Red Wing's weeping... #
What are you doing out here?
What does it look like?
Wandering round in the woods at night ain't exactly safe.
You better get in.
Thank you. I told you
I'll take care of myself.
Guess you're right at that.
But you better keep an eye out for rattlers and coyotes and skunks.
A lot of mountain lions around here too.
But I guess you can take care of yourself.
Come on, Brodie. Ah, Stubbie!
Thanks, pal.
- Dan!
- Hold it!
- Hold it!
- Wait a minute!
- I've changed my mind.
- I was hoping you would.
We both looked kind of lonesome the way we was.
Hiyah!
Moon sure is pretty tonight.
Don't you feel like talking?
The Indians offered you the oil lease today, didn't they?
Yep.
- What are you going to do about it?
- Nothing.
That's what I thought.
- Too bad too.
- Why?
With those Indian lands, you could amount to something, do something worthwhile.
- You think so?
- Well, don't you?
I never thought much about it one way or the other.
It's about time you started thinking about it.
Do you want to be just a cowboy all your life?
Doing odd jobs, wearing other people's clothes?
Don't you realise you could control everything?
You could be big, important.
Bigger than anyone around here.
Would you be satisfied if I went back and punched Mr Gardner in the nose?
Giddy-up!
Hold the team, Smokey.
Must be an election going on.
Dan, you could be like that.
You mean full?
No, of course not. I mean you could make everyone look up to you.
Can now, in there.
Unless I'm sitting down.
Oh...
(Despirit) Daniel!
You done it for us!
- Done what?
- We've been waiting.
You're going to make us all rich.
(Man) Thanks to you, cowboy, lands in Oklahoma...
Oh, son, let me shake your hand.
You're gonna save us little fellas.
Rich and five of Gardner's best men are with us.
Shut up, Wilkins. Let me talk.
Keep still! Let me tell him.
Take up the Indian lease.
The whole town's backing you against Jim Gardner.
I'm no oil man.
I may be nothing else, but I'm an oil man.
- Now you're talking, Rich.
- (Dan) I ain't even a businessman.
(Bessie) I am.
(Man) You've nothing to worry about.
(Dan) Drilling wells takes money.
(Despirit) That's what we're saying - we raised the money, us little fellas.
It'll be us and the Indians instead of Gardner.
- What do you say?
- I'm sorry.
- The Indians gave you the lease.
- We've got some rights.
- I'm not the man for this.
- You're just the man!
If you don't take it up, Gardner will.
He's going to Washington to get the lands.
(Catherine) Well, if he can, we can!
(Man) Sure, she's right.
(Despirit) Say you will.
If you don't think anything of yourself, think of the others.
- Give us a chance!
- Yes.
You work those lands, you'll give us all a chance.
We can lick that Gardner to a frazzle.
(Man) Sure we can.
Seems like everybody's made up their mind but me.
It ain't my money and it ain't my oil lands.
I know how you folks feel and I'd like to please you, but still and all,
I've got to sleep on this proposition.
That's good enough for me.
Drinks on the house for everybody.
(Man) Come on! You heard the man!
Ain't you taking a roundabout trip to the orange blossoms, honey?
To the bar, boys!
Oh, Dan, come along.
I want you to dance with me.
Everything else has happened to me.
I might as well go whole hog.
Well, I'm not made of glass.
- Huh?
- I won't break.
Oh. I'm warning you - my feet ain't as light as my head.
- You're a wonderful dancer.
- Am I?
Stay out of things you don't understand.
Daniel! Stand back! Give him air.
Oh, Dan. Dan.
Hey... what happened?
Three guesses.
- Gardner.
- Give the gent a cigar.
I guess I slept on that proposition long enough.
- How do you get to Washington?
- (All cheering)
Hasn't the president sent for you yet?
No. Still warming the chair.
Has Jim been in there?
In and out more times than a Sunday shirt.
Fix your tie. Look pleasant.
Why? Am I having my picture taken?
(Man) The president will see you, Mr Gardner.
Thank you. Good afternoon.
At least we can say we saw somebody who saw the president.
Gentlemen, I'm warning you -
I'm prejudiced in favour of the Indians.
If their land is opened up,
I'm going to be positive that they get the best deal possible.
I have studied both applications carefully.
I'm ready to give my decision.
You have the full support of the Department, Mr Gardner.
I've met every requirement of financial backing and experience.
Mmm. That's more than I can do.
Where is the other applicant?
Daniel Somers is a penniless Oklahoma cowboy with nothing to recommend him.
Dan Somers? Is he in Washington?
- He's outside, but the Department...
- Hang the Department.
- Sergeant Dan Somers?
- Yes, sir.
Come here, my boy.
Delighted to see you. How are you?
- Still kicking, Mr President.
- That's what I'm doing.
- Where did you go after Cuba?
- The Philippines, sir.
The Philippines, huh?
Come in. Come in.
Say, how did you get to the top of San Juan Hill ahead of us?
I had the longest legs, I guess.
My boys have a dog with long legs.
They named him Sergeant Somers.
- I hope he's good.
- He is.
The sergeant was one of the toughest scrappers in my old regiment.
Well, if that don't beat a carpet.
I presume you know each other.
Of course.
Now, making a decision, as I've pointed out, my only interest is in the Indians.
I see, Mr Gardner, that you offer them 12.5o/o royalty
while the sergeant here offers them 50o/o - unquestionably a better deal.
Not if the man lacks the money and the experience to develop the lands, Mr President.
- Quite so.
- 50o/o royalty is unheard of.
It's... it's fantastic!
(Gardner) How Mr Somers expects to make good with no experience and a few farmers, I can't answer.
Perhaps he can.
Would you like to try to answer that, Sergeant?
Well, what Mr Gardner says is so - about us being a small detachment of dirt farmers.
But these men came in with the land rush and stuck through the dust and the drought.
Most of them ain't oil men but they'll make a go of things because this is their chance to take a chance, to have something for themselves.
And about that 50o/o -
I was raised around the Indians and I've seen them pushed and squeezed enough.
If my offering them half of what already belongs to them is fantastic, then that's what I am, whatever it is.
I don't suppose you have any personal interest in this?
Of course I have.
I ain't doing this for nothing.
I'm a 1 o/o stockholder in this deal.
Sergeant, how long will it take you to sink a well if you keep pushing?
Our head driller says about four months.
Gentlemen, our country owes all of its progress to a small detachment of pioneers - men who asked only for the chance to take a chance.
That spirit is the essence of America.
Sergeant, I'm going to give you your chance.
Thank you, sir.
You have four months to make good.
(President) It is understood, Mr Gardner, that you are to take over the deal, providing that Mr Somers fails to comply with the conditions of output and delivery.
- That clear?
- (Gardner) Yes, Mr President.
Good day, gentlemen.
Well, congratulations... on winning the first round.
- Come on, let's celebrate!
- Yes, let's do.
"Providing, however, that this grant to Daniel F Somers and Company
"shall be void unless a well is completed within four months
"and unless
Somers and Company deliver
"a minimum of 10,000 gallons of oil
"to the Oklahoma Refinery at Tulsa, Oklahoma
"on or before August 31."
- Short, sweet and final.
- And airtight.
- How's he getting along?
- He's doing all right.
Can that outfit deliver 10,000 gallons of oil before September 1?
- I could.
- Well, that's different.
Hold those wagons. Hold it!
Start unloading that lumber.
We're going to spot in right here.
Where?
Three steps off that rock
Despirit's sitting on.
What are you, a marker?
One, two, three.
- Right here.
- No, here.
We'll split the difference.
- Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.
I've been over every inch of this reservation, my nose scraping the ground like a hound dog.
Well, here's hoping.
You looking for somebody, Cherokee?
Look for you. Want job.
Sorry, we're fresh out of bodyguarding jobs.
Try your old boss - there's an opening there.
His side not my side.
You work for Indian. I work for you.
You really serious about that "work"?
Sure. Me strong.
Let's see how strong you are unloading them wagons.
- Then we'll talk.
- Sure, boss.
- (Catherine) Oh, Dan.
- (Bessie) Whoa!
We're waiting for you to drive the stake.
Come on, honey.
And give it everything you've got.
(Laughing) Well, this is really an occasion.
I guess you'll need some help.
No, I can do it. I want to.
Hold it. Let's christen this well right.
That's my last drink till the well's in and the oil's delivered.
- (Bottle smashing)
- Nice going, Rich.
- Now...
- Better take your hand away.
I got confidence in you.
Shut her down, Dan.
- How far are we down?
- About 900 feet.
The deeper we go, the richer it looks.
Like most things, Wilkins - you dig deep to get anything worthwhile.
We'd be better off with a new bit.
We lose time dressing this one and waiting while she cools off.
Why don't we buy another one?
On account of the Oklahoma Tool
Supply Company is owned by Gardner.
Where you been all this time?
Can't we get one from Kansas City?
Sure, get delivery in about two months.
Our date in Tulsa's in two weeks.
Let the boys get back on their job. Come on.
Well, goodbye, Dan.
Oh, uh, here, uh...
I uh... got something for you.
Oil sands, huh?
(Dan) No, it's a bottle full of rainbows.
What does it mean, Dan?
You never see a rainbow unless the storm's over and fair weather's ahead.
And if you follow a rainbow, you sometimes find a pot of gold.
Oh, a bottle full of rainbows.
Boy, that would go straight to my head.
- Well, so long, Dan.
- Goodbye.
Now, then. All together, fellas.
# Down by the old mill stream
# Where I first met you...
(Catherine) Whoa.
- Evening, Miss Cathy.
- Hello, Despirit.
# Your eyes of blue
# Dressed in gingham too...
I suppose your granny always tells you a stitch in time saves nine.
The way she always puts it, we...
Oh, never mind your granny.
Give me that.
New moon.
- Did you make a wish?
- No.
But if I had, it'd be to see you sitting there sewing just like that.
There. I made a wish for both of us. Do you mind?
Any way you want it, that's the way I want it.
You never talk much, do you?
Maybe that's because my granny always says the second fiddler's got to wait his turn before he can sing out good and loud.
If you had made a wish, what would it have been?
You know the bend in the river where the cottonwoods grow?
I'd build me a house right there.
I didn't know you thought of such things.
I've been thinking about that since I was a little tyke.
I even thought of it over in the Philippines.
I could see it just as plain...
Smoke coming out of the chimney, nice horse in the corral.
I could even see a girl with sorrel hair standing in the doorway.
But of course now that
I'm pretty near a dashing tycoon, almost, things will be different.
The house will be bigger, be extra rooms for the kids, a big open fireplace.
There'll be a fancy stable instead of that old pole corral.
Is that all you want?
Well, what else is there?
Oh, Dan. If I were going to be a dashing tycoon, I'd be dashing.
I'd have automobiles and private railroad cars.
Why, I'd have a whole train.
If I found someone I wanted,
I'd sweep her right off her feet.
I'd take her with me to the end of the line - all the way.
You would?
I certainly would.
I'd be bold and daring, I...
You know, I'm going to like this dashing tycoon business.
I...
I'd better be going.
Oh.
It looks good, don't it, Rich?
Use your nose. Smell it.
It's oil. Sure!
It's gas fumes you smell now.
Next comes the oil - a gusher or I miss my guess.
What's it like when a really big gusher blows in?
I've seen them tear the whole derrick up at the roots.
- How soon?
- Any time now.
Hey, did you hear that? Any time.
Oil!
- Tie it up, boys.
- (Men grunting)
- (Bessie) Come and get it!
- (Bell ringing)
Come on, boys. Come on. Wash up.
Make the most of it.
This is our last hot meal.
And no more smoking.
Can't afford to take a chance with all that gas rolling in.
(Despirit singing) # If I had a bank like Pierpont Morgan
# And Miss Annie Hill would hold me and sing
# If I ambled to the altar with Heddy Green... #
- Whoa!
- # Then I'd be satisfied all right...
(Shouting) Quit it, will you?
Stop your fooling, Daniel.
I was only drying your beard, you old Rocky Mountain canary.
Come on. Grub's a-waiting.
Thanks. You put me first in the line.
Mmm, that smells good.
Be nice. Pass it on.
Oh, no, thanks. I ain't got no appetite.
Like a little kid waiting for Santy Claus.
Well, ain't we all?
Get back!
Wilkins is out there!
He's still alive.
Go get the backboard, Despirit.
(Dan) Watch his back.
(Man) Hold him.
Stay here. Check up on things.
- I'll say I'm going to check up.
- See you at the hotel.
Just sent a wire to Mrs Wilkins.
- How is he?
- I don't know yet.
The doctor's still in there.
Well?
Nothing left out there but a hole in the ground.
We... washed up?
Unless we can get a hold of a portable rig.
You'd better go in now.
How is he, Doctor?
Hiya, Wil.
She blew in a gusher, didn't she?
Yeah. Sure.
Then we're... all rich, ain't we?
You can take her easy now, partner.
Emma used to joke and say that out of our first barrel of oil,
I was to buy her...
...a sewing machine.
Do you think you could see that she gets it, Dan?
Sure. It's the first thing I'm going to do.
Then I got nothing to worry about, have I?
Nothing to worry about.
I got a sewing machine downstairs, Dan.
Thanks. This one's got to be brand-new.
Daniel.
Now I remember.
Cherokee was fooling around with the boiler when we was washing up.
That was no accident out there.
It was dynamited.
All this time we've been playing right into Jim Gardner's hands.
Oh, wait a minute. Dan.
You may be wrong. Don't go there.
Somebody will be killed.
- Somebody has been killed.
- But it won't help matters if...
Let me handle this.
But, Dan, it may be you!
Aren't you going to stop him?
No, ma'am.
Oil well gone. Everything blow up.
I use dynamite. Smart, eh?
- You thought I'd be pleased?
- Sure.
I'm not. Why did you do it?
I no like cowboy. You no like cowboy.
Now I get job back.
You stupid...
(Catherine) I must see Mr Gardner.
(Man) Sorry, he's busy.
Jim, Dan's coming here.
Someone blew up our well.
- He thinks you...
- I had nothing to do with it.
- Someone will be killed.
- Thanks for the warning.
- You don't want it to be me.
- I don't want it to be anyone.
You've licked us. Isn't that enough?
Jim, stop things before they get worse.
You know, Kitten, you've changed.
You're more attractive than ever.
Get outta the way!
Dan, I asked him.
He had nothing to do with dynamiting the well.
Stop and think, cowboy.
If I had, you'd have been blown up.
I'm not sure about you yet.
But I am sure about the Cherokee kid, and I saw him come up here.
Wilkins was killed and that's gonna be paid for if I have to tear the town apart, beginning with your pet rabbit.
All I want is that portable oil rig.
Why don't you come get it?
I'm going to. I'll tell the sheriff why I killed him.
What are you gonna say?
Self-defence.
The same thing if I find you on my property.
Dan, I want to talk to you.
You picked your side. Stay there!
(Despirit) 4,375...
(Man) Getting hold of this portable rig by starting that prairie fire was a great idea, Dan.
(Dan) Maybe, but the well ain't in yet. Keep working.
(Despirit) 4,378...
- (Dan) Stop counting!
We've been drilling through that oil sand for the last six hours.
Now, why don't she cough it up?
Ah, coyote!
Well, we're all set to cap her when she comes in.
Yeah. When?
Cup of coffee?
Well, he beat the oil in.
Stick to your jobs.
Keep working as long as you can.
Hello, Gardner.
Nice weather we're having.
I don't suppose you heard about the fire last night?
- No foolin'? Put it out?
- (Gardner) Mm-hm.
Funny thing - when we got back, my portable rig was missing.
You don't say!
All right, men. Take down my rig!
I thought you'd be expecting me.
I was, kinda.
You didn't think I'd be coming alone?
No, not exactly.
(Man calling out in Native American language)
Watch it, men! Keep your eyes open!
(Speaking in Native American language)
(Shouting in Native American language)
What'd he tell him?
He says this fight belongs to you and him, personal.
Hold it, men, unless they start something!
(Grunting) I guess that puts the weight on our side.
Cowboy, I've been looking forward to this for a long time.
(Dan) Don't let me disappoint you.
Make him holler, Daniel!
Give him that one-two I showed you!
Look out!
What in tarnation's holding Gardner up?
What's holding Dan up?
(Dan) Cut her off! Cap her!
You can have your rig now,
Mr Gardner.
And we'll pay you for the wear and tear on it.
Yeah? When?
Right after delivery tomorrow.
Tulsa's a long way from here.
How you gonna get
10,000 gallons of that stuff to the refinery before it closes?
Through the pipeline.
(Laughing) lt'll be a neat trick if you can do it.
I just bought the pipeline.
Thanks for the gusher.
You can have the rig. Come on, men!
Say the word, Daniel, and I'll mow him down!
I'll burn the well before I see it handed to him on a silver platter!
We gotta dig up everything that'll carry oil.
We ain't got a chance.
There ain't half a dozen tankers fit to use.
No, but there's lumber and there's tar and there's tonight.
There is a chance!
Got her working, Rich?
You bring in those tankers, I'll fill 'em.
Well, you'll be filling before morning.
How much does she hold, Mil?
Just about 500 gallons.
That does it, Dan.
Drive on down to the main road and wait with the rest of them.
Come on, get a move on!
We're running oil, not molasses.
(Man) You heard what he said - get busy!
Hey, that cowpoke can get real cantankerous, can't he?
So can Jim Gardner.
Come on, we gotta look busy anyhow.
I can never remember which way a left thread turns.
To the right, naturally.
Hot Joe! Got the coffee ready!
(Despirit) Eats! What a pleasure.
Help me, Despirit.
Uh-huh - just like my granny always says,
"The way to a man's heart's through his stomach."
Oh! (Laughing)
Come and get it!
Grub's ready!
- Coffee and stuff!
- (Dan) Get back on the job!
We can eat later when time don't mean anything.
They can't keep working without food!
They're dead tired and so are you.
Is everything ready, Bessie?
I'll pour the coffee.
- What are you trying to do?
- I'm trying to help.
- Ain't you a little mixed up?
- No.
I thought you'd picked your pasture.
I didn't pick anything.
You did that for me.
You took it for granted...
You were just passing the time of day with Mr Gardner?
Daniel, someday
I'm gonna be forced to whip you.
Come and get it!
When we get started, line out single file.
And keep 'em close together!
Well, we're all here.
- Let 'em roll!
- Hiyah!
# Oh, if John D Rockefeller was my valet
# And I had my vittles served by a king... #
That fire come up this canyon like it was a smokestack!
- What do we do?
- We're going through. Fast.
(Despirit) Get back in line!
You can go through, Somers, but I'm going back.
Rich, get up there and take over those lines!
- Get away!
- You heard him. Move over!
Let 'em roll!
You know fire and oil don't mix?
If you don't like it, get out! Hah!
Hiyah!
Say, you're on fire!
What do you make of this, Daniel?
Looks like somebody got the idea of fighting fire with fire.
Get up on another wagon!
Hah!
Hiyah!
(Bessie) Better get some wood for the fire.
If they don't get here soon, we're sunk.
Oh, they'll make it.
Dan'll bring them through.
Yeah. Well, I better get that coffee back on the fire.
When we get to the relay station we'll have some work.
Keep 'em rolling, fellas!
Grub and fresh horses ahead!
Hah!
Here they come!
Bessie!
- Bessie, they're driving in!
- Come on, get busy! Get busy!
All right, you fellas.
Get them teams changed!
Oh, Dan, we thought you'd never get here!
- You're hurt!
- Don't worry about me.
Come to the wagon. We'll bandage...
Want to help? Stay out of the way.
Hurry up with them horses!
We ain't got all day!
Hey, you jughead.
- You been riding upside down?
- Huh?
If you ever talked to me the way you talk to her, you'd be unwrapping yourself from around a coffee pot.
Some people learn to keep their mouths shut.
That's what we promised and that's what's caused the trouble.
- What?
- You thought she went to warn HIM.
It was YOU she was thinking about!
She tried to get us to stop you, but we was too crazy mad to think about anything but trying to get even.
She was thinking about keeping you out of trouble.
This is the thanks she gets.
Why, you lump-eared mule!
Get over there now and straighten yourself out!
(Man yelling) Work fast!
Shake out them ribbons!
I don't seem to be doing so good by myself.
I wondered...
Could I get you to help me?
- Aren't you a little mixed up?
- Yes, ma'am.
I'm plenty mixed up.
Sit down. Let me help you.
- Ow!
- Oh, I'm sorry if I hurt you.
That's just what
I've been trying to say to you.
Let's not talk about that.
Let's talk about the bend in the river where the cottonwoods grow.
You remember that?
Why, of course I remember!
I remember the... the house and... the pole corral.
No, that was gonna be a fancy stable.
(Rich) Dan?
I've been checking with the men.
We haven't a chance to make Tulsa before 6:00.
- We're sure gonna try.
- Sure, we'll try.
Gardner will be helping Witherspoon close those gates on the minute.
- Charlie Witherspoon?
- That's right.
- Is he gonna close them gates?
- Yeah.
Over my dead body!
And it ain't dead yet.
Come on, sister.
We've got loads of work to do.
See you in Tulsa, Dan!
Come on. Let's get rolling.
Wait till they hitch the horses to the wagons.
Oh!
(Bessie) Got a long way to go and a short time to get there!
Mr Gardner!
Well, Miller? They turn back?
No, came right through the fire.
Smashed a few wagons, that's all.
Stupid cowboy.
Doesn't know when he's licked.
What do we do now?
Relax. Everything is being done.
I want those orders straightened out!
I guess that'll settle it.
- Hello, Charlie!
- Why, hello, Mr Gardner!
Come in, come in!
It looks like your luck is holding.
I guess you'll work the Indian lands.
Get your hat.
It's all over but the celebrating.
Oh, I can't leave till closing time tonight.
My signature goes to Washington on those contracts too.
A mere technicality. Get your hat!
I'd like to, but I've gotta stay till 6:00.
You can have a drink, can't you?
I don't mind if I do.
There's nothing against that in the contracts.
(Man) Get your reins in your hands.
We're moving!
Hurry up! Grab a bite and let's get going!
You all set?
Yeah, let's go.
It's a long way to Tulsa, men.
Let 'em roll!
Come on, let's get going.
I'm sorry, Mr Gardner. Not till 6:00.
That's right, Charlie.
Stick to your principles.
You know, I have plans.
- They might include you.
- Yeah?
Things ought to be happening pretty soon now!
This is like shooting fish in a barrel!
If you can't ride that, get to the rear!
Blame that fella up ahead!
- This one's going on awful fast.
- Shut up.
(Catherine) There's Tulsa!
And that pipeline I bought empties right into your storage tanks, doesn't it?
You mean you're gonna buy out this whole refinery?
You're beginning to catch on.
And that's only a starter.
- (Charlie whistling)
- We can go far together, Charlie.
- (Clock chiming)
- (Charlie) Yeah!
That should clear your conscience.
Let's lock up and paint the town.
Gardner must be inside!
All right, kid, you keep him occupied while I make Witherspoon forget the time.
(Charlie) # Come along with me, Lucille
# In my merry Oldsmobile
# Down the road of life we'll fly... #
- (Bessie) Hello, Charlie!
- Bessie!
- Charlie! How are you?
- I'm awfully glad to see you.
Why, Jim Gardner - imagine finding you here!
(Gardner) Quite a coincidence.
(Bessie) Hiya, Jim.
I don't like to interrupt this little reunion.
- But it's after 6:00.
- That's right.
You ladies wait here while I close up.
I'll be right back and we'll all celebrate!
Oh, no, you don't, Charlie!
You told me that 15 years ago!
This time I ain't taking no chances.
(Bessie) I'm staying right with you!
Kitten, I'm glad you're here.
We... we've lots to talk about, haven't we?
Certainly have.
- (Laughing)
- Now you can get busy!
Keep driving unless you want a little of the same!
We're a mile from home.
Stay with her, Despirit!
I'll stay with 'em till the wheels come off! Hiyah!
- You sure you don't want a drink?
- No, thanks.
Aren't you going to congratulate me?
Before the fight's over?
Isn't that bad luck?
The fight is over.
The cowboy was licked before he started.
We both know that.
I'm talking about us.
- Us?
- We've wasted a lot of time, Kitten.
Let's get back on the train.
We'll go straight to the end of the line with no stopovers except for a honeymoon at Niagara Falls.
- What do you say?
- I got off that train a long ago, Jim.
I'm trying to catch a ride on a cowboy's wagon.
And here he comes!
Charlie? What happened to your boss?
I believe the lady took him for a buggy ride, Mr Gardner.
Dan!
Dan!
- Dan, I knew you could do it!
- With gallons to spare!
You made it.
You don't know when you're licked.
You can't bring oil in with those every day, but I've got a pipeline...
I've got a proposition to make you in my office, when I get one.
Why not in here?
Never let pleasure interfere with business.
Sure. Excuse us.
Where's Daniel?
He's in conference with Jim Gardner.
What happened?
Gardner's sleeping on that proposition I made him.
Oh, what'd you do that for?
Now we got money, I want to buy back that thousand-dollar introduction.
Here you are, Rich.
You kept your word.
Well, come on!
We ain't on the wagons now!
Dan, you're going to be a real tycoon!
And you can build...
WE can build... that house by the river.
And let's have your granny come and live with us.
- Who?
- Your granny.
Oh, uh, there's just one catch to that.
- What?
- Well, I ain't never had a granny.
That is, leastwise, that I can remember.
You see, she was only uh... uh... poetic licence.
You faker!
You fraud!
You darling!

Fair seat, bad hands, mount not sufficiently schooled.
Disqualified.
Here comes the California cockerel
Ten pesos he clears 'em all.
Cleanly? Taken.
Grow wings, my friend.
Ten pesos, if you please.
Maybe you've forgotten that in California they use horses for cradles.
- Well done, señor. Excellent.
- And all I did was sit on his back.
Three carrots after his oats tonight.
- You go to an affair of the court?
- No, of the heart.
- Something is wrong.
- The face, man. The face...
Why the fine feathers?
A señorita that would put St Anthony on the griddle. We're to meet in...
Have you forgotten that you cross swords with Lieutenant Cortez at three o'clock?
It slipped my mind.
Why do I have to meet every swordsman in Madrid?
Everybody enjoys a certain amount of fighting, but why do they all pick on me?
Calm yourself. It's become a distinction to assail a California cockerel.
You pink them slightly in the arm or shoulder and they boast of having met you.
Cadet Vega, the commandant wishes to see you in his office at once.
Good. I can't possibly fight the fellow now.
Explain that to him, will you?
And tell him I'll meet him tomorrow.
Señores, your attention, please.
I'm buying wine for all.
Come on.
It's your last chance to fill up on me.
Last chance?
What do you mean?
My father has ordered me home.
I sail on the first ship from Lisbon.
To California?
But what about your commission here?
I'll have to give that up.
What's it like in California?
Are the Indians troublesome?
- Then who is there to fight?
- No one.
Then what will you do with this spur of yours, my cockerel?
This...
Leave it there.
And when you see it, think of me, in a land of gentle missions, happy peons, sleepy caballeros, and everlasting boredom.
Wine.
A toast.
To California, where a man can only marry, raise fat children, and watch his vineyards grow.
- Are the vineyards bearing well this season?
- By some miracle the grapes remain sweet.
- Why so gloomy, my friend?
- People can't sing with hatred in their hearts.
- Hatred for whom?
- The alcalde. May his soul burn in hell.
The alcalde?
A kinder, better man never lived.
You don't know him.
I should know him.
He's my father.
I said it, and I won't deny it. I've taken
20 lashes before for a slip of the tongue.
Row, row.
Get me to shore.
- I'm honoured. How can I serve you?
- A glass of your best wine.
- You are a stranger in these parts?
- No, not exactly.
I was born and raised not far from here.
I am the son of the alcalde.
Where can I get a carriage to drive me to Los Angeles?
Well, wake up.
Didn't you hear me?
This way.
Pedro, here is a caballero who would employ you. He is the son of the alcalde.
I want to be driven to Los Angeles.
I have some boxes and a portmanteau.
I'll pay you well.
Stop staring at me.
Will you drive me or not?
What's come over this country?
Have you all gone mad?
Listen, you.
Find speech, or I'll cut out your tongue.
Please. You are too late.
Your good father has already attended to that.
My father?
What are you talking about?
I'm sorry, but at a meeting of the peons, this man spoke against the heavy taxes.
The next day, the soldiers of His Excellency cut out his tongue. I swear it is true.
Therefore, until we receive the reinforcements promised us...
So people can still laugh in California.
I'd begun to think they'd lost the habit.
- Your name?
- He claims to be the son of the alcalde.
I claim nothing. I am Diego Vega, son of His Excellency, Don Alejandro.
And this, although I find it greatly changed, is my home.
Your pardon, Don Diego. I'd not heard of your returning. Welcome to California.
I'm Capitán Esteban Pasquale, military aid to the alcalde.
I'm honoured, but bewildered.
Why has my father turned his home into a barracks?
Conditions have changed since you left.
Your father resigned. Age, you know.
Since then, the peons have become more industrious.
As to the caballeros, they're encouraged to think of their own affairs.
We take care of the government.
I see.
- Tell me, who holds the office now?
- Don Luis Quintero. I'll take you to him.
Thank you, but I should like to see my family as quickly as possible.
- Where are they living?
- At your old hacienda.
But His Excellency'll never forgive me if I let you go without a word of welcome from him.
I'm quite sure that you'll save me a reprimand.
How could I refuse a man anything with a naked sword in his hand?
So a wit has come to Los Angeles.
Carry out your orders, Sergeant.
Foolish habit of mine.
Some men play with a glove, or a monocle, or a snuffbox.
Churchmen finger their beads.
I toy with a sword.
Do you fancy the weapon?
I know very little about it, my dear capitán.
Swordplay is such a violent business.
So, this is the bird that killed the black-breasted red?
Was it a bloody battle?
At the side of the pit, all the people were covered with blood.
Pity I missed it.
What are you asking for him?
This is a noble bird. Well tested.
I'm asking 40 pesos for him.
40 pesos? Esteban, this cheating dog should have his taxes raised.
Oh, no, Your Excellency.
The bird is yours, as a gift.
- Not one centimo will he cost you.
- That's a better attitude. Much better.
Turn him over to my handlers.
And what caballero is this?
Or is he some young lord from Spain?
A good guess, Excellency.
He's just from Spain.
This is Don Diego Vega, son of your respected predecessor.
I thought such fabric came from Madrid.
Must have cost you plenty, eh?
The caballero is here for words of welcome, not to discuss the price of his clothes.
Of course.
To be sure.
Welcome back, young sir.
Regard this house as still your home.
Luis, a ship has arrived from Spain.
The shops will have something worth looking at at last. I need...
Money.
It's always money.
I don't know this caballero.
- He's just off your precious ship from Spain.
- How delightful.
Will one of you ill-mannered boors present him?
Don Diego Vega.
Señora Inez de Quintero.
My wife.
Your Excellency is a very fortunate man.
I'm not so sure.
She thinks pesos grow on mulberry trees.
Your husband was also fascinated by the caballero's clothes.
Your pardon.
We're overwhelmed by the latest fashions.
And no wonder.
What is there here to interest a woman?
I long for the life you've been leading.
The gaiety and splendour of the court.
- Patience, my love. You'll see it all someday.
- Doubtless, when I'm an old hag.
That catastrophe could never overtake you.
Did you hear? How easily he makes pretty speeches.
I regret that...
You were saying?
I was saying that I must tear myself away and make some speeches to my father and mother.
Don't leave me to these barbarians.
Come to the shops with me and help me make my selections.
Oh, you tempt me.
I love the shimmer of satin and silk, the matching of one delicate shade against the other.
Then there's the choosing of scents and lotions - attar of rose, carnation, crushed lily, and musk.
- As for ornaments and jewels...
- But Don Diego must see his parents.
Too true.
Duty rather than pleasure.
I'll see you to the door.
That's one little peacock that won't give us any trouble.
You think not?
The capitán is jealous. The fop has pricked the fencing master. Touché.
I don't like such jests.
Your eye might fail you.
It's possible.
- Who was that?
- No one you know.
- Someone new. Very charming.
- He must be, from the colour in your cheeks.
At last, after all these months in this dreary place, someone who knows the newest fashions, the latest dances, how to flatter a woman.
- When can I meet him?
- Listen to the child.
You're much too young to cope with his sort.
Why do you allow her to wear that mantilla?
It makes her look like a woman grown.
I am a woman grown.
I'll be 18 my next birthday.
Carmen Castellano is a month younger and already wed.
Her grandmother was a peon.
Such riffraff wed when they like.
You have the blood of the hidalgos in your veins.
Keep it cool, my girl, or I'll whisk you into a convent.
I pity your poor mount, Sergeant.
Such a heavy whip.
Do you think I'd strike a good mare with this?
It would ruin her, break her spirit.
See? She didn't flick an ear.
She knows. We are collecting taxes from the peons today.
And you use that little switch on the taxpayers?
Only when they are stubborn.
When you come to collect my taxes,
I won't be stubborn, I promise you.
Turn right in here.
Mother.
- My son. My baby.
- Mother.
Hello, María.
Good old Juan, fat as ever.
Hello, Manuel. And José.
Where's Father?
In the study with Fray Felipe.
Come, he's longing to see you.
Take Don Diego's things to his room.
I tell you, these conditions are beyond bearing.
This whole district, from the hills of Verdugo to the shores of Del Rey, is a stench in the nostrils of heaven.
- I know.
- You know, yes.
- But what do you do about it? Nothing.
- What can...
Father.
My boy.
Padre.
Welcome back to your home and my heart.
- I've missed your wise counsel.
- Not too greatly, I suspect.
You remember Don Miguel and Don José?
- Have you returned to steal more melons?
- Melons?
This scamp and my scapegrace son crept into my garden and gorged themselves on my seed melons one year.
But God punished us. We were visited by the father of all bellyaches.
But he's ripe for more than boyish pranks now.
- I feel good muscle here.
- Arms, muscle... You men.
Is he without a face? Can't you see he's even better-looking than when he left?
You should have seen me when I approached the Spanish throne for the first time.
They said I looked like a frightened gopher.
More like a young angel, I'm sure.
An angel. That's what we need in California now. An angel with a flaming sword.
Please, don't start that.
He didn't come home to get himself killed.
Hold your tongue. Go to your women.
Leave my son to me. Sit down, Diego.
- What is all this, Father?
- Well, I am no longer alcalde.
- In my place is a man...
- In his place sits a viper so foul and black...
Ah, to be alone with him for five little minutes.
Long enough to tear his windpipe out of his throat.
God forgive me.
- Why did you resign in the first place?
- I was forced out of office.
They threatened to burn the homes of the peons.
- And now he sits here doing nothing, when...
- Enough, Felipe.
The friar urges me to lead the caballeros in a revolt which would surely fail against a garrison of trained soldiers.
Even if I thought it would succeed,
I'd refuse just the same.
- But why?
- Because the law is the law.
I will not rebel against the government
I served for 30 years.
But that government is now vile and corrupt.
I know, but two wrongs don't make a right, and never will.
- That is my feeling also.
- Sometimes, one must fight fire with fire.
I am a Vega. I will not follow the lawless footsteps of Luis Quintero.
- Nor will my son.
- No, of course not.
By the way, I went directly from the ship to our old home.
I met Señor Quintero and his charming wife.
I found them very pleasant and agreeable.
Pleasant scorpions.
Agreeable rattlesnakes.
Oh, Padre. The alcalde spoke with great respect of you, Father.
I must admit he hasn't troubled me or my flocks so far.
That being the case, why get overly excited in this heat?
I know I'm going to miss the scented breezes of Spain.
Then you believe we should not be moved by injustice and cruelty until it touches us?
But, my dear Padre, such things exist in the world and always will.
By the way, I took up sleight of hand while I was in Madrid.
It's all the rage just now.
Watch closely.
To think that the boy that I helped to raise, the boy that I taught to hold a firm wrist behind a true point, has turned into a puppy.
How vexatious. Well, I must go and remove the dust of travel.
I'll see you later, Father.
Stay where you are.
Put this up.
Put it up. Be quick about it.
Back to the barracks.
I don't understand why you insist on this stupid drive. And without an escort.
- I have my reasons.
- Suppose you share them with me.
Look... Gold. An agent of the Bank of Madrid is meeting us in a quiet inn.
This goes to Spain.
For us, my love.
I see.
How stupid of me.
- A military guard would...
- Let Esteban know about this transaction.
- Of course, he would have claimed his share.
- I'm afraid so.
Don't move if you want to live.
- A bandit.
- I have distressing news for you.
I had a small drinking bout with the agent of the Bank of Madrid.
While in his cups, the fellow was somewhat indiscreet.
A drunken man is untrustworthy.
I will act for him. Hand it over.
- And that little trinket.
- You would rob a woman?
- I can't afford gallantries.
- I refuse. You dare not take it.
Quickly. I should hate to mark such a lovely cheek.
This time I take only your money.
Next time...
What a nice, quiet study, Your Excellency.
I like a quiet room. Very quiet.
What do you want?
A little talk with you, that's all - if we come to an understanding.
Do you think the climate in Spain will agree with you?
Why do you ask?
Because you're either going there or to some place you might not like so well.
Which will it be?
- Spain.
- It's a very wise choice.
Now to the matter of your successor.
What do you think of Don Alejandro Vega?
He's had experience.
- What does it matter to me?
- Nothing.
But to the people of this district, a great deal.
When you resign, you'll appoint
Don Alejandro as your successor.
As you wish.
This will remind you that
I have been here once, and can return.
- Close your eyes.
- What are you going to do?
- What's that?
- The point of my sword against your throat.
Don't move until I take it away.
- What if I faint?
- You won't.
What's this?
Are you trying to commit suicide?
Speak up.
What's the matter?
- He was here.
- Who was here?
Ridiculous.
- Your fears have addled your brain.
- I tell you, he was here. In this very room.
- Anybody pass by this way?
- No one.
- Has anyone entered this room?
- His Excellency and yourself.
- Anyone else?
- No.
Do you need any more proof?
You must have fallen asleep and dreamed it.
Did I dream that?
Sergeant, turn out the guard. Zorro is somewhere on the grounds. Find him.
I still can't believe the fellow was here.
If you'd sat here with a sword at your throat, perhaps you'd believe it.
- How on earth did he get in?
- That's what I'd like to know.
- And it's your business to find out.
- What did he say?
He wants me in Spain and Vega in my place.
Now we have something.
This Zorro is a caballero.
A ordinary brigand wouldn't concern himself with Vega.
- It would serve you right if I did go to Spain.
- And give up 50,000 pesos a year?
I can't collect it if I'm dead.
And you get a third for protecting me.
But what protection! You can't keep even keep one mad dog off my neck.
Can't I?
I'll find him, I promise you.
In the meantime, I'll put a solid wall of men around this house night and day.
- I can't afford to lose you, my dear Luis.
- No, You can't.
Your pickings end if anything happens to me.
That's exactly what I meant, Excellency.
Blessed Mother, send someone to take me from this dreary place.
Someone I can love and respect.
Let him be kind and brave.
And handsome, please, dear Mother.
Fray Ramón, I didn't see you when I came in.
I'm not Fray Ramón.
I'm Fray Pablo, from the mission.
I've just been spending the evening with Fray Ramón.
Father, I was asking the Holy Mother to save me from a convent.
- Is that a sin?
- The sin would be in sending you to one.
- I don't understand.
- Well, a young girl with your...
I just think that you would probably be more useful outside a convent than in.
- You mean in serving God?
- Yes, in a way.
In what way?
Well, the Church must have sons and daughters, if she is to flourish.
- Do you follow me?
- I think so.
- You mean that I might marry and...
- Yes, exactly.
Strong sons and fine daughters to the glory of God.
I was praying just now for a husband.
You were? Fine.
I mean, it's quite natural at your age, my child.
Yes, but it's not natural for a girl of my age to long for a husband to rescue her.
- From what?
- Father...
Will you sit here and talk to me for a little while? I'm troubled, deeply.
I want to leave this lonely place.
I want to meet young people.
Girls of my own age.
No one ever comes here.
The caballeros avoid this place like the pest house.
- Why?
- They hate my Uncle Luis.
You know, I feel that there's something wrong about him.
Decidedly wrong.
What do you think?
If people hate him as you say, you have your answer there.
Then I was right. Perhaps I should be glad my Aunt Inez is sending me to a convent.
No, don't be glad about that.
I mean, probably your aunt feels that that atmosphere is better for a young girl,
- but I'm convinced...
- Inez? Oh, no.
No. That's not why she's sending me.
María says she's jealous.
She says it's because I'm good-looking.
- María has excellent eyesight.
- Thank you, Father, but are you sure?
No one except María ever says I'm pretty.
Pretty? Why, you are more radiant, more lovely than a morning in June.
You really think that?
- With all my heart.
- I've never heard such words before.
They make me almost lose my breath.
You should hear such words every hour of the day.
You're not in the least like Fray Ramón.
You talk so strangely.
You're not a padre. You're an impostor.
You're wearing a sword.
We've been looking everywhere for you.
Zorro broke into the house and threatened your uncle.
They think he's still hiding somewhere close by.
Come along. Lock the doors after we leave, Fray Ramón.
The beast may try to rob the altar.
Good night, Padre.
Padre, you dropped something.
There he is.
There.
Three pesos.
Three pesos.
Four pesos.
- Nine pesos.
- I cannot pay so much.
I swear, it will leave me without a centavo.
- Nine pesos.
- But we will starve.
- How can I feed my family?
- Nine pesos.
Please, I beg of you.
My little girl...
That's all.
I'll relieve you of that, Sergeant.
I'll take that.
Get back.
After him.
Hear our prayer.
And drive far away from it... all the snares of the enemy.
And let thy holy angels dwell therein... to keep us at peace.
And may thy blessings... be upon us always.
Good evening, Padre.
It was so dull at home, and I remembered that you played a fair game of chess.
So I took the liberty of riding over and setting up the men.
What's the meaning of this?
How dare you?
We are after Zorro.
We saw him ride toward the mission.
Good evening, Sergeant.
- Zorro, you say? What's he done now?
- Enough to get himself hanged.
- Have you seen him?
- I have only this moment left the chapel.
- How long have you been here?
- Some little time. It seems like hours.
I've been waiting to play chess with the good padre.
- It's a dull game, but what can one do?
- You have seen or heard nothing?
Of Zorro? Heaven spare me.
My blood chills at the thought.
Out of here.
Search the grounds.
What's disturbing you, Padre?
Thoughts of that bandit?
- Puppy.
- Oh, my dear Padre, really.
When I think of what one man, single-handed, has accomplished against these devils, and see you, the last of the Vegas, trembling at the very mention of his name, I could...
Can't you even listen to me?
Ordinarily, I'd drink in every word you say, but just now...
Thank you, Mother.
- Quick. Hide this plunder.
- Plunder?
Don't stand there gaping at me like a fish. Put it away.
- What is this?
- It's some of the alcalde's gold.
And this I took from his charming wife.
It's pretty, don't you think?
You took it?
Have you seen this one, Padre?
So my old mentor has no more wit than the rest of them, eh?
Are you trying to make me the receiver of stolen goods?
No, the dispenser.
This gold was wrung from the peons.
It's up to us to restore it to them.
My boy.
My boy.
My Diego.
Then you will lead your people against these scorpions?
No, we'd be no match for their trained troops. My father was right about that.
You must have had the alcalde at your mercy when you took the gold from him.
I would have snuffed him out like a candle.
God forgive me.
It would accomplish nothing.
Anotherjust like him would take his place.
I see.
I see everything.
Diego, don't deceive your father any longer.
- It's not fair to him.
- I don't like doing it. Believe me.
But I must.
My father is such a stickler for law and order, that I'm afraid he might spoil all the fun.
But what do you hope to achieve all alone, taking his money?
Oh, no.
But I may be able to persuade him to resign and name my father in his place.
- Amusing, don't you think?
- If you live.
Doña Inez begs you to make yourself comfortable. She'll be down shortly.
What's this?
- Don Diego Vega.
- Oh, yes. What can I do for you?
Have you forgotten that you urged me to regard this house as still my home?
Did I?
It's very good of you to remember the offer, but didn't you have trouble getting in?
Oh, no. I had a note from Doña Inez asking me to ride with her this morning, and I just showed it to the sentries.
Excellent.
Come into my study till my wife appears.
It's been Esteban's privilege to ride with her each morning.
Why is this house so closely guarded?
I swear I saw a full company around it.
- I wish there were twice as many.
- Their clatter would drive me to distraction.
I find it reassuring.
Let me show you something, young man.
Look.
The mark of Zorro.
He came here one night.
He threatened my life and left that.
I should be petrified.
He's mad, of course.
Quite mad.
- You think so?
- Of course.
There was a case in Madrid, almost identical.
This fellow's mark was a cross.
He was a madman.
Cunning beyond belief.
They always are.
He killed 40 people.
Slit their throats from ear to ear.
Warned them first, you know, and then...
It's a pity your sense of duty keeps you here.
- Frightful risk.
- Sense of duty?
Yes, of course.
I'm so sorry to have kept you.
Esteban was surly about our little ride.
- I'd promised the morning to him, it seems.
- Your invitation was a smile from heaven.
- I was positively suffocating with boredom.
- Then let's fly. I'm dying for a canter.
Goodbye, Luis.
Don't work too hard.
Goodbye, Excellency.
Esteban, Vegajust told me a horrible tale about a madman in Madrid, like this Zorro.
- He thinks I risk my life by staying here.
- Forget your fears. I have a plan.
Yes?
What is it?
Don Alejandro is the leader of the caballeros.
Zorro wants you to appoint him in your place.
- What do you gather from that?
- Go on.
Doesn't it suggest to you that Zorro is the tool of Don Alejandro?
- Perhaps, but how can we prove it?
- We can at least help the situation.
- How?
- Form an alliance with Don Alejandro.
That's impossible.
You know Vega's attitude.
Perfectly, but Lolita should have a husband.
What could be stronger than a matrimonial alliance?
Royal families keep the peace of Europe in bridal beds.
Diego and Lolita.
Not bad.
Not bad at all.
Diego, talking with you is like a drink of cool water in the desert.
- Oh, it's a pity.
- What?
- I mustn't make you discontented.
- Oh, please. Of what were you thinking?
I was just thinking how you're being wasted here.
Your beauty, your gift for words, your perfect poise.
You were born for something higher and more civilised than this provincial life.
I know.
- May I tell you something?
- Anything.
Yes, of course I may.
I felt from the moment we met that we...
Esteban is urging me to leave my husband and go to Spain with him.
- Oh, but my dear, no.
- But I'm dying here.
Go to Spain, but not with Esteban.
With whom, then?
- With your husband.
- My husband?
- Go to romantic, beautiful Spain with Luis?
- Let me explain.
As the wife of the one-time alcalde of Los Angeles, you'd be received at court.
But as the companion of a second-rate soldier of fortune, you'd be ostracised.
I see.
But Luis at court, imagine.
In Spain the husbands of adorable ladies are merely background.
- I'd be lost among so many.
- Not you.
You'd need only one "friend" to introduce you into the proper circles.
But I have no such friend in Madrid.
Who knows? I don't intend to remain in California for ever.
- What you suggest is utterly impossible.
- I'll give a dowry of 20,000 pesos. 25,000.
Are you buying my son, Señor Quintero?
- There's the practical side to consider.
- It doesn't enter into this.
You come here on a friendly mission with half a company of troops. Why?
Not to threaten you, Don Alejandro.
It's because of this Zorro.
Zorro is only a symptom. This district is bleeding under your vile administration.
I would never appear to condone it by marriage between our families.
In that case, the friendly attitude
I've taken towards you, will cease.
What is all this turmoil about?
His Excellency has offered a marriage between his niece Lolita and you.
His niece?
How flattering.
But why should that cause an argument on a hot day like this?
- Do I have to explain?
- Your father resents my efforts to make the people of the district more industrious than under his regime.
Grinding them into poverty and despair to line your own pockets is hardly...
Oh, politics, politics.
What have they to do with my marriage?
- You'd marry into the family of this...?
- How can I tell until I've seen her?
- She may look like her uncle.
- Quite right. I...
Oh, no. She's a sweet little dove. It would desolate us to have her leave the nest.
If she were Venus, she'd still be his niece.
But, after all,
I'm not marrying His Excellency.
Don't you think the wishes of your father in this sort of matter should be considered?
I had no say in my father's marriage.
Why should he try to instruct me in mine?
Exactly.
Will you dine with us tonight?
- Charmed.
- We'll expect you at eight o'clock.
Diego, what have you done?
It will be all right.
No matter what you think now, please don't worry.
This was your doing, you sly beast.
You gave Luis the idea of this marriage.
Alliances for the good of the state have been fashionable since the dawn of history.
- María, my knees are shaking.
- Yes, that is natural.
- Shall I bow, or give him my hand to kiss?
- Both. First the hand, then the bow.
It's 20 minutes past the hour.
What can be keeping him?
Well, well, well.
Here you are at last.
I was afraid that you might have been waylaid by that Zorro fellow.
Oh, heaven spare me.
- I am dazzled.
- And here is our little dove, Lolita.
- I am honoured.
- Charmed, I'm sure.
May I present Señora María de López?
You'll forgive me for being late.
They heated the water for my bath too early.
It was positively tepid. By the time more was carried and properly scented...
Life can be trying, don't you think?
- Oh, please.
- Courage.
Well, shall we dine?
Come, Diego.
His bath was tepid.
Poor Lolita. I'm afraid her wedded life will be the same.
- Please do that again.
- As you wish. Observe closely.
- Amazing.
- Quite simple.
- Have you seen this one?
- No.
Now, observe very closely.
- Frightfully amusing.
- Yes, I did this one for His Majesty.
- It must be heavenly at court.
- It's the one bearable spot on earth.
Speaking of that Zorro, Excellency, could you provide me with an escort home?
On the way here, I fancied that cutthroat lurking in every shadow. I was unnerved.
How distressing.
- You don't approve of my request.
- You called her hero a cutthroat.
Have you met the fellow?
I've never so much as seen his face.
I happen to admire courage.
Dashing about with a cutlass has been out of fashion since the Middle Ages.
It seems to be quite effective. He is like a lion among a lot of frightened sheep.
A madman, that's what he is.
Undoubtedly.
Capitán, you seem to regard that poor fruit as an enemy.
A rival.
My dear Esteban is for ever thrusting at this and that.
He used to be a fencing instructor in Barcelona.
How exhausting.
- I didn't find it so.
- Then why did you give it up?
- Unfortunately, I killed a man of influence.
- A lady was involved, I believe.
The gentleman's wife, no doubt?
Just how did you mean that?
I'd hoped to be amusing.
Have I failed?
Somewhat.
With me.
What are the new dance steps?
You know them all, I suppose.
- I'm afraid so.
- I would so love to have you show me.
Gladly.
- Inez would enjoy it more.
- Nonsense, my child. Dance with him.
Play "El Sombrero Blanco".
I never dreamed dancing could be so wonderful.
I found it rather fatiguing.
- If you'll excuse me, I wish to retire.
- So sorry.
- What's got into the girl?
- Who knows?
- Our little dove has flown.
- I don't like it.
You can't be serious about this marriage.
But, my dear, it's perfect.
You and I could be seen together anywhere in Madrid without any danger of gossip.
- Excellency, your niece is charming.
- A sweet child.
May I plead with you for her hand in marriage?
A refusal would crush me.
She's yours, my dear Diego, with all my blessings.
Who's there?
- I have a confession to make.
- Please go. You'll be caught.
I must talk to you.
Now, look here, my girl.
What do you mean by running away from the man to whom I've promised you in marriage?
- You've done that without asking me?
- Of course.
What do you know about such things?
And it's time that you understood that...
- Who's that?
- No one.
Forgive me, my dear.
I've been an old fool.
You seem to know how to handle these matters much better than your Uncle Luis.
You?
Don't come in here.
I have something important to say to you and I don't want to be interrupted.
You, pretending to be Zorro.
I don't care to hear anything you have to say.
So unlock that door and go.
I'm glad to see you took the advice
I gave you in the chapel.
About not hiding such beauty in a convent.
What did you say?
You're more lovely, more radiant than a morning in June.
Surely I must be dreaming.
- You are Zorro.
- Yes, Lolita.
In order to accomplish what I set out to do,
I've had to deceive people, including you.
Yes, I see.
I understand.
You don't have to explain.
You came here to tell me that asking to marry me was just part of the game.
Oh, no. That's the one real thing about this whole masquerade.
- Go quickly.
- Ride with me tomorrow.
Yes, but go.
Be careful.
- Open the door.
- Yes, I'm coming.
You seem upset, my dear.
Have you been crying?
- Yes, I have.
- I understand.
This marriage was your uncle's idea.
He's not your type, and far too sophisticated.
- You really think so?
- Beyond a question.
I saw how he affected you tonight.
My heart bled for you, my dear.
When you tell Luis you'll have none of this marriage, you'll have my full support.
I hardly know what to say.
Uncle Luis has done so much for me.
Nonsense. He has no right to expect you to spoil your life.
Any marriage is better than none, I suppose.
Perhaps I could learn to tolerate Diego.
I do so want to please Uncle Luis.
There's such a thing as carrying gratitude too far.
We can't ask you to spend your life with a man you think repulsive.
We'll talk of this again in the morning.
Good night, my dear.
Past midnight.
He's not home yet.
- How can you read?
- It's the latest European styles.
- Bustles are coming in, it seems.
- Bustles! What is a bustle?
It's something to build you up here.
Our only son in the clutches of those polecats, and you sit there planning to decorate your...
There you are. Why didn't you spend the entire night with your delightful friends?
What have you done about that girl?
Well, how did you get out of it?
She's perfectly charming.
A lovely, unspoiled child.
- You'll be delighted with her, Father.
- I will be delighted? What have you done?
I've just taken the first steps toward making you a grandfather.
What?
What a son you bore me.
An alliance with those terrible people.
Why did you do it?
- For the best reason in the world.
- What is that?
- Lolita Quintero.
- She attracts you?
- It's more than that. From the day I first saw...
- I thought you hadn't met her until tonight.
I did catch a glimpse of her some time ago, and...
You're concealing something from us.
I'm sure of it.
- It's time you went to bed.
- Very well.
But, Diego, tell me as soon as you can.
I will, Mother.
- What's the meaning of that?
- Gonzales was collecting taxes.
A priest resisted.
The fool gave him ten lashes.
- Send Gonzales to me.
- I wish I could.
- What's to prevent it?
- The total disappearance of Gonzales.
- He's gone? Where?
- To Hades, I hope.
I'll collect the taxes myself from now on.
That should teach them.
What's that?
You...
- What's that?
- Sergeant Gonzales. I think he's dead.
Dead, you say?
- He's alive.
- He's got a Z on his chest.
José.
How is the little one?
She is well again.
I brought this to give thanks to the church.
Give thanks in your heart.
Buy milk for the child with this.
No. This is for the church.
I come at precisely the right moment, it seems.
- I'll take that.
- These are the funds of the mission.
Not any longer.
Hand them over.
- I refuse.
- In that case, I shall take them.
You should have been a soldier rather than a churchman.
No wonder you chose the Church.
- Where did you get this?
- I'll tell you nothing.
Run me through and have done with it.
No, my dear Padre.
We shall presently hang you.
For the last time. If you marry that girl, you leave this house for ever.
It might be rather amusing to live with the Quinteros.
If I'd only left him in Spain.
Wait till you see her.
She's just like this blossom.
I'll never see her.
I promise you that.
- We are not at home.
- I'm at home to the señorita. Show her in.
- So you defy me, too?
- You're not being sensible.
- Father, this is Lolita.
- I am honoured.
And my mother.
Please forgive me, but would it be possible to see you alone for a moment?
Señorita, will you answer me one question?
- Certainly.
- Do you want to marry my son?
- Why, yes.
- Why?
Well, I love him.
You are right, my son.
She is like the flower.
Something terrible has happened.
They've arrested Fray Felipe.
They say he is Zorro and they are going to hang him.
- Where is he now?
- At the barracks. What can you do?
I don't know yet.
So far I've only frightened your uncle.
This may mean I'll have to do more than that.
Do you understand?
If that becomes necessary, will it make any difference between us?
Sentries!
There's someone in that chair. Seize him.
Diego, what are you doing here?
You frightened me half out of my wits.
This is too much, really.
It's distressing enough to call on my betrothed and not find her at home.
- Now to be manhandled by these ruffians.
- Leave us.
Where is Lolita?
Oh, riding, driving, walking.
What does a young girl do?
Am I to understand that my betrothed is allowed to wander about the countryside without a duenna?
I protest, Your Excellency.
I protest strongly.
I can't discuss that now.
Do you know Zorro had a priest for an accomplice?
We arrested him today.
And another horrible thing happened to me.
Sergeant Gonzales was beaten half to death by Zorro.
He shoved him over the wall right before my eyes.
How frightful.
But after all, it was harder on Gonzales.
This is no time forjesting.
Perhaps, that madman is lurking on the grounds right now.
What shall I do?
I offer rewards and nothing happens.
He may change his mind about you.
Those creatures usually do, I believe.
He may decide to cut the throat of someone else.
- Must you always talk of throat-cutting?
- How thoughtless of me.
- What you need is a drop of brandy.
- Yes, brandy...
It's gone. I'm surrounded by idiots.
Stupid servants, stupid soldiers.
I admire you tremendously.
Your courage, your fortitude.
Why, a weaker man would forget his civic duty and get away from all this.
- You rang, Your Excellency?
- Yes, brandy.
- On the desk, Your Excellency.
- It's not on the desk. Bring some.
A situation of this sort would wreck my constitution in a week.
But then I haven't the iron nerve of Your Excellency.
Your Excellency, come quickly.
Something has happened in the cellar.
Guards.
You, follow me.
Look.
Look, Your Excellency.
Here in the cellar, right below my study.
Here's his trail.
It goes this way.
It ends here.
He couldn't have gone through the wall.
He's not human. He's...
Light my way out of here. Quick!
You were right.
I'll leave this cursed place.
I'll do as he asks.
Pen, paper...
A man should consider his wife.
Inez has gone crazy over the idea of Madrid.
She's been at me night and day to take her there.
This should do it.
This should suit that maniac.
There, look it over.
That's very direct.
But you forgot to sign.
- Sign what?
- My resignation.
Zorro will kill me if I stay.
You may escape him, but I will surely kill you if you write any more of these.
But I'm in grave danger.
Diego here will bear me out.
You're in even greater danger than he thinks.
So you tried to get gold out of the country?
If you ever again take one peso of mine,
I'll cut your throat from ear to ear.
I must ask you to change the subject.
He objects to talk of throat-cutting.
Quiet, you popinjay.
I've no reason for letting you live either.
What a pleasant coincidence.
I feel exactly the same way about you.
You wouldn't care to translate that feeling into action, would you?
I might be tempted, if I had a weapon.
Would you?
Now, please, gentlemen.
- This is going much too far.
- It's only to serve you, Excellency.
You have a champion, Luis.
And what a champion.
I'll make it short, and save you fatigue.
- Sentries!
- No interference, Excellency, please.
We have a hero with us.
- Are you all right, Diego?
- Ask the capitán.
Get out.
The fencing master has met his equal.
Careful.
- Are you tiring, Diego?
- No, Excellency, I'll take you on in a moment.
- It's a good effort, capitán.
- My next will be better, my fancy clown.
- The capitán's blade is not so firm.
- Still firm enough to run you through.
I needed that scratch to awaken me.
He's dead.
Well, he's been troublesome lately.
And you killed him.
A secret stairway from the cellar.
We just discovered it.
A secret stairway?
Leading here?
Good. Very good.
Excellent.
You shall be rewarded.
Sentries!
Keep that man covered.
Take him to the guardhouse and lock him in the cell.
- The strongest cell you have.
- Why arrest me, Excellency?
For three reasons. First, you have mud from the cellar on your boots.
Second, that secret stairway happens to be in your old home.
And third, you handle a sword like a devil from hell.
And that's exactly where you're going, Señor Zorro.
That's a pretty way to treat your future nephew, Uncle Luis.
No more of your wit.
Take him away.
You, Morales...
Send the officer of the day to me. I want all caballeros and peons summoned here.
All caballeros are requested to report at the alcalde's residence immediately.
- At this hour? Ridiculous.
- The alcalde's orders.
Sergeant, assemble your men for firing-squad duty.
- But why did they arrest Diego?
- I don't know.
Luis won't tell me.
He must have lost his mind.
Come in.
His Excellency requests you ladies to stay in your rooms tonight.
- Why?
- I cannot say. I was ordered to tell you.
Firing squad, forward.
- Good evening.
- Why are we meeting here, Señor Vega?
What do you know, Alejandro?
Nothing. I was forced to come here like the rest of you.
They must be up to something.
Good evening, señores.
It's a pleasure to see you here.
Get to the point. Why have you dragged us out of our homes at this hour?
To witness a delightful spectacle.
You will find it particularly interesting.
I'm executing a caballero at midnight.
- What caballero?
- Who is it?
The man you selected from among you to defy me, to threaten my life.
I brought you here to see him die as a lesson to the lot of you.
I, for one, don't know what you're talking about.
You almost convince me.
Too bad you're about to lose the best actor among you.
But in a few moments, you'll see your precious Zorro shot.
Observe very closely.
Watch the candle.
Blow.
You should really see something worthwhile, like changing a copper coin into solid gold.
- Can you do that?
- The good padre here has seen me do it.
- Many times.
- It was a secret discovered by Merlin.
It's been handed down through a long line of sorcerers to some of us living today.
You can change a centavo into gold?
- Easily.
- Please, do that for me.
I am very weary.
I must seek repose.
I have a wife and seven children, and the little I earn isn't enough for them.
Please, make gold for them and I'll pray for you.
If I must, I must.
Now, hold the centavo in your closed fist.
Tightly now.
Put your fist well through the bars.
Cold iron will spoil everything.
I take your fist gently, like this.
Open the door.
Be quick about it.
Get in. Get down under there, close to the wall.
And not a sound.
Close the door.
Hide this in your robe.
Sit down.
And now, you will behold the result of your rebellious plans. Come in.
Here is Zorro the fox, safely trapped.
Diego!
What is this?
What idiotic joke is this?
- As if you didn't know.
- Luis Quintero, you are a fool.
Zorro is a man. This is my worthless, trick-playing offspring.
Have you seen this one, Father?
Help!
Zorro is loose.
- Señores, are you with me?
- I am with you.
God, forgive me.
God, forgive me.
What a splendid audience you have.
Peons, caballeros, everyone.
- It was thoughtful of you to have them here.
- Luis, what's happened?
Good evening, ladies. You're just in time.
His Excellency is about to make an address.
Address? What shall I say?
You know.
The little matter of your resignation.
Quiet!
Quiet for His Excellency.
We're waiting. Go on.
Good people of Los Angeles, owing to my ceaseless efforts to improve conditions in the district... my health is endangered.
I have therefore decided to give up my office and go to Spain.
To succeed me as alcalde of this district,
I am naming my illustrious predecessor,
Don Alejandro Vega.
And now, Your Excellency, I personally will accompany you to the wharf at San Pedro.
I wish to bless your voyage, and ask God to reward you according to your merits.
Spain...
Spain!
Diego, when may we expect you and our dear little Lolita in Madrid?
- We'll follow the customs of California.
- What do you mean?
We are going to marry, and raise fat children and watch our vineyards grow.

Whoa, General!
Hey! Whoa, boy!
Get me out of here!
Hey, get me out of here!
Get me out of this!
Unbuckle him!
Are you all right, father?
Leave me be, you Judas.
Here.
Fours left, column left.
Gallop. Ho!
Hiya.
Afternoon, Mr. Lewton.
Where the devil is everybody?
The place is deserted.
I don't rightly know... exceptin' that the Senator went riding.
The senator went riding?
You must be going out of your mind.
No, sir. He went riding with lots and lots of other men.
And I heard they're having a kind of a meeting.
What kind of a meeting?
I don't rightly know, but I said to Mrs. McCanles...
"Mrs. McCanles, where are all those men going?"
And she said...
Never mind.
She did say...
"Vashti, go right on about your business.
"Right on about your business."
I guess this means good-bye for a while.
Now, don't you cry.
I'll be back before long... and he'll get over it when the railroad comes through.
I always knew you'd have to leave someday... but now that it's come,
I just can't bear it.
It's not as bad as all that.
I'll get a place in Austin.
You can come visit me.
If you're a good girl,
I might even take you... on a little trip to New Orleans.
No. He'd never forgive me.
I'll never see you again. Never.
I know it.
He said he'd shoot you if you ever step foot on...
One McCanles can be just as tough as another.
Mrs. McCanles, come in here!
You better go to him now.
But you won't go yet awhile?
No. I'll just pack my things and say good-bye to Pearl.
Are you there?
Jesse, go away, please.
What you scared of,
Pearl, honey?
Come on in.
Thanks for knocking.
I didn't used to think... there was much to all those fancy manners of yours... but I guess I was wrong.
Jesse, I...
Forgive me for intruding, Pearl.
You, too, Lewt.
Good-bye, Pearl.
Wait a minute, please!
I didn't mean to...
It's all right.
I understand perfectly.
No, you don't.
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to Austin.
You gonna be gone long?
Quite long, I'm afraid.
It isn't because of...
No. Bless your heart.
I'm leaving by request... the Senator's request.
Going away, Jesse?
Uh-huh. Your dream's come true.
I'm going away.
It's gonna seem kind of lonely around here... without the judge, ain't it, Pearl?
Yes, it is.
Don't see how we'll know... when we're doing right and when we're doing wrong.
You surprise me.
First time I knew... you were interested in ethics.
I'm sure you folks will excuse me.
You must have a lot of things you want to talk over.
The nights are long, oh, so long
It is going to be lonesome without you.
I just don't know how I can stand it.
You seem to be doing all right.
I'm sorry. That was mean of me.
I couldn't help it.
You just can't go away believing...
I tried hard. Honest, I did.
I know.
Lewt's hard to resist.
No! I hate him!
I know what you're thinking.
I guess I'm just... trash, like my ma.
You mustn't believe that.
It was Lewt's fault.
You needed some help.
I did. I needed you to help me.
I might as well say it.
I loved you.
Somehow you touched me.
You... love me?
I thought of what you'd be like when you grew up a little.
I didn't know.
Why didn't you tell me?
I didn't think it would be fair to tell you.
I was a fool.
I came to your room to say good-bye... to tell you that someday
I'd be back for you... that I'd think about you and that I'd write...
I'll write to you.
You will?
If you need me, I'll come back,
Senator or no Senator.
And you'll forget about... about tonight, won't you?
You'll forget it?
No, I don't think I'll forget.
I don't think
I'll ever be able to.
I shouldn't have told you the way I felt.
It wasn't fair.
There I go again, trying to be fair.
Trash.
I hear you turned out to be... a prize yellow dog down at the fence line.
I should have done that to you years ago.
Nights are long, oh, so long
On the prairie
Got to get me somebody to love
The dirty skunk!
All right, Jesse.
You said you'd never forget.
This the other one you meant, Lewt?
You don't like this, but you're gonna get it... right over the head if you don't settle down.
What's the matter?
You having trouble?
Back, you killer! Back!
Here, Ed.
Don't pick up that halter!
He'll charge you!
You're scared of him, and he knows it.
Never run from him.
Stand your ground.
Come on, boy.
I got a nice leather bonnet for you.
Easy, boy.
Be careful.
- He's just plumb crazy!
- Don't you worry none about him.
Look out! Watch his feet!
He's got his ear.
Ear him down!
Dig 'em deep.
That'll stop him.
You got him.
Nobody could have done it but you.
That's all there is to it.
Just don't let him bluff you.
You see, there ain't nothing to handling stallions.
It just takes a little know-how.
You sure got nerve.
Get away, Ed.
You're the boss.
What?
You don't have to stay around here anymore, do you?
Don't never have to do nothing.
I stay around here because I like it.
Bet you I can hit that ding-dong straight off.
Who cares?
What's up?
Nothing. Just practicing.
Can you shoot?
Sure. It's easy.
That's what you said about bareback riding.
All right, I'll show you.
Better not try it.
You might hit Ken... or the mare, more likely.
Sure is doggone hot.
Sure is.
You know what I'd like to do?
What?
I'd like to take a swim.
You mean it?
Sure, I mean it.
Let's go to the sump.
I don't mind if I do.
Am I your girl?
Of course you're my girl.
Then we can be married, can't we?
I guess so.
No. If I'm not good enough to marry...
I'm not good enough to kiss.
Come here, you bobtailed little tree cat.
We're bespoken, ain't we?
It wouldn't do no harm to tell folks, would it?
Sure, we'll tell them.
Can we tell them soon?
Can we tell them
Saturday at the barbecue?
Sure, we can. Why not?
What you got here?
Something the sinkiller gave me.
He said it would keep me... sweet and clean as the first milking.
Who cares about milking?
I don't want no milkmaid.
Don't you get awful tired eating just beef?
Wish we could get an eighty-hour week.
Yeah. Me, too.
Kind of miss Jesse around here. Don't you?
Jesse? Better not mention his name on Spanish Bit.
Can't get over Lem Smoot joining those railroad people.
I always say, if you can't whip them, join them.
Never saw so many crows... around here before in all my life.
Wish they'd learn to grow corn without husks.
Wouldn't surprise me none if that Indian girl... didn't up and massacre the whole dern lot of them.
When I'm married...
I'm gonna have lots and lots of parties.
But who would do all the work when I gives my party?
I likes fishing better than I does dancing.
You never go fishing.
I never goes dancing neither.
The gals to the center and ring to the left.
The boys shake hands and go to the right.
Now weave a basket.
Circle left.
Now we'll weave that basket the other way.
Senator, they appreciate it very much.
I try to show my people a good time, eh, Lewt?
You bet your boots, Senator.
Now, birdie in the center and seven hands around.
Bird hop out, and the crow hop in.
She around the she, and the he around the he.
The he around the she, and the she around the he.
Four hands up, and here we go.
Hurry up, boys, and don't be slow.
'Cause you'll never get your love if you don't do so.
Pearl, dear, I've been looking all over for you.
You should be downstairs.
It's very rude.
I'm sorry.
I was fixing my hair the way you told me to.
Do I look all right, ma'am?
You're the prettiest girl at the party.
Here, dear. Wear this.
You're so kind to me... this dress and everything.
Come, dear.
Oh, ma'am! What's the matter?
It's nothing. Let's go.
Balance your partners, and two ladies cross
You cross to that cowboy so true
I sure love being here,
Mr. McCanles.
Fine. There he is.
Lewt, come here.
You call me, Senator?
Yeah. Wheel me in there.
Come on, boy. Come on.
Something wrong, Senator?
Close the door.
So this is where that squaw lives, huh?
Scott Chavez.
I've been meaning to speak to you, Senator.
I think we ought to kind of fix it up...
Too good for her, if you ask me.
- She's all right, Senator.
- She's all right, huh?
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
I've been watching you... making calf's eyes at that half-breed.
Have you lost your mind?
I don't understand you, pa.
You want me to have a good time, don't you?
Sure. Is that all you got in mind?
Of course.
I ain't been working thirty years on this place... to turn it into no Indian reservation.
You know me better than that.
- Is that right, son?
- Yeah, sure.
You had me worried for a time, boy.
- Shove me out of here.
- All right.
Yes, a little relaxation is mighty pleasant... after a man's been chasing Satan all the way from here to Austin.
Yes, sirree, bob.
You've been to Austin?
Did you hear anything of Jesse?
I heard plenty.
Enough to warm the cockles of your gentle heart.
You know what they're saying?
He'll be governor of the whole dern state... before he's ready to meet his maker.
I knew it.
Do you think it's true?
Judging from the fancy office he's got already, it's true.
Has a rolltop desk and a gold spittoon... you couldn't miss if you aimed from here.
I hope he isn't working too hard.
I shouldn't fret too much about that... not while old man
Langford's daughter... is as sweet and pretty... as the sunrise on the mesa,
I wouldn't.
Yes. He wrote me about her.
He says she's a lovely girl.
If wedlock's his aim... he couldn't shoot at a neater target.
What are you looking so sad about, Pearl?
This is a party. Come on.
Let's show these cowpokes a thing or two about dancing.
Girl, where's that medal
I gave you?
I...
She loaned it to me.
I'm trying to get... one just like it made for myself.
Good. Good!
Put your left foot, put your left foot
Put your left foot just so
Put your left foot, put your left foot
Put your left foot just so
Take a step to the side, take a step to...
Come on, honey.
Don't let them yokels laugh at you.
But I don't know how.
It's easy. Just follow me.
Now you're doing it.
Won't they be surprised when they hear about us?
When they hear what about us?
That we're bespoken, of course.
Oh, that.
But that's what you said.
You said we'd tell them tonight.
Just as everything is going good... you got to go and start all that again.
Either you tell people we're bespoken, or I will.
I want to tell you something... you don't fool me none no more.
Will you stop poking up and vexing me?
I don't know how a man stands it, the way you go on.
You think you don't have to marry me.
Maybe you don't.
And you don't have to go on... lying to me no more neither.
I made up my mind.
You made up your mind about what?
Just like I said... if you won't marry me,
I'll get out.
I'll go away as fast as I can.
You can go and keep going for all I care.
Go find yourself somebody else to pester.
But don't you care?
No woman can tie onto me like that... least of all a bobtail little half-breed like you.
All righty.
Thanks for letting me know... how you think about me.
El Paso and Amarillo ain't no different... than Sodom and Gomorra... on a smaller scale, of course, but...
What in Beezelbub's name do you call that?
I wasn't having a very good time at the party neither.
I was just kind of tired.
Who are you?
I'm the new straw boss around here.
Name's Pierce.
Sam to my friends.
Mind if I sit down?
If you want.
Must be plenty tiring on a person, all that dancing.
- Don't you dance?
- No, ma'am.
Somehow, I never got the chance to learn.
You ought to. It's fun.
Lots of folks seem to think so.
How would you like to learn tonight?
What? Do you mean you'd teach me?
I ain't so good at them fancy dances myself... but we could learn together, if you want.
- I'd be right honored.
- Then come on.
Come on!
The next dance will be ladies choice.
The ladies choose the gents.
Gents line up over on this side... ladies over yonder.
Now, ladies, this is your big chance.
And don't be afraid to go after the true love of your choice.
I'd rather play me some poker.
Females shouldn't be allowed no choice.
It ain't decent.
I'll bet you six bits that fat one grabs me.
You leave Jake alone.
You had him all evening.
Of all the nerve!
When I stomp my heels three times... run for the gent of your choice.
Ready? One, two... scat!
I want you to get acquainted with little Lewt... the longest-legged critter this side of the main house.
He's so cute!
A lot cuter than big Lewt.
He's just like silk.
There you are, ma.
Want to see the others?
Yes. And I'm gonna help you take care of them, too.
Sure, you are.
Ain't they wonderful, these babies?
Any kind of babies.
They sure are.
I remember reading something once when I was a kid.
What?
You'd think I was silly... a big galoot like me spouting poetry.
No, Sam. Please.
I'm going to sit right here until you tell me.
It goes something like this.
For everything created in the bounds of earth and sky... has such longing to be mated.
It must couple or must die.
That's the best poem
I ever heard.
I'm glad you like it.
You married?
Nope. Never run across anybody I wanted to marry.
Besides, I never got up nerve enough to ask anybody.
I guess you must be getting pretty old.
Yep. Old enough to be your father... and then some.
Why?
Nothing.
I guess, just the same... there are plenty of women who would marry you anyway.
I better be getting home.
Mrs. McCanles is kind of ailing.
You wouldn't marry me, would you?
- What did you say?
- I said, would you marry me?
Don't get mad, please.
First time in my life
I got up some nerve.
How could a big galoot...
Don't say that.
You don't know about me.
If you did, you wouldn't ask.
You mean about Lewt?
So you know about me and Lewt, too?
Yeah, I guess ain't nobody don't know.
I've knocked around plenty...
- I'm trash, I tell you.
- Don't go telling me that.
I'd kill the first man who said anything like that.
But I don't love you.
Don't that matter?
You've only known me a little while.
I know I'm not something girls dream about... like the McCanleses.
- I'm not rich like them either.
- It ain't that.
But I'd love you, and I'd take care of you.
I got a little money saved.
Get a little ranch of our own, maybe.
Won't you even think about it, honey? Please, honey.
Don't you call me "honey."
Lewt called me that.
You're all alike!
Coming?
I hope I didn't say nothing to hurt your feelings.
That's all right.
I'll marry you if you still want me to.
You mean it?
I declare. I never saw... so many cows before in all my life.
I'm afraid they're not all cows, Helen.
Sometimes, my dear, I think... that I didn't bring you up properly.
All right. I understand.
All I need is a hint.
Those steers are from Spanish Bit.
I thought your father's ranch was hundreds of miles from here.
See? There's the brand.
They're on their way to market.
If it ain't the big railroad man.
How's everything at the Bit?
Getting along just fine since you left... Mr. McCanles.
Same old Sid.
I'll be inside, darling.
Come, father.
Hey, that Langford's daughter?
Heard you were kind of sweet on her.
Yes, that's Miss Langford.
Pretty, ain't she?
We could use a few like her around the ranch... especially now that
Pearl's going... maybe.
What do you mean?
Darnest thing you ever heard.
She's getting married.
Can you imagine anybody marrying Pearl?
Is she marrying Lewt?
Lewt? What would Lewt...
Nah, she's marrying Sam Pierce.
Pearl ought to be very happy with Sam.
She ain't marrying him yet.
She ain't marrying nobody... until Lewt decides to give the bride away.
So long, Judas.
Can't say I like... your Spanish Bit people very much, if he's any criteria.
Darling, I've been thinking.
Why couldn't there be a spur track right on Spanish Bit?
Then they could just ship the cattle... instead of driving them all that distance.
You're not even listening to me, dear.
Certainly I am.
You were saying...
You were asking if...
What were you saying?
I was trying to prove... what a helpful wife
I'm going to be.
Give me a kiss.
I couldn't help overhearing.
What?
You liked that girl, didn't you?
You still like her?
I'm sure I'll always be devoted to her.
Hope you'll like her, too.
But you were in love with her, weren't you?
Yes, I was in love with her.
I said I was.
Jesse. Father.
Sometimes I think he didn't bring you up properly.
What were you worried about when I came out just now?
Worried? I was just wondering what my brother Lewt might do.
Zeke, where's my peppermint and soda?
Coming up now.
Hear you named the day.
That's right.
Ring just come in the last post.
Mighty pretty. Yep.
You sure are shot full of luck.
I'd like to stand the drinks for everybody.
I'm getting married in the morning.
That's fine.
Save your money, Pierce.
So you figure you got yourself a wife.
I don't figure. I know I have.
Think you can keep her?
Reckon as how I can.
Cattle rustlers and women rustlers.
Both of them steal... what's got another man's brand on it.
I don't think I like the way you're talking.
Maybe I didn't rightly understand you.
Yeah, you understand me all right.
Pearl Chavez is my girl, and she'll always be my girl... just as long as I want her to be.
From now you, you're gonna respect Pearl's name.
If that ain't the best joke yet.
He's defending the lady's name... my girl's name.
Has anybody else around here... got any fancy ideas about Pearl Chavez?
Don't seem to be no takers.
I don't rightly know much about Sam Pierce, O Lord... but from what I hear... he'll be needing no introduction to you.
Seeing as how Sam was snatched from his loved ones' arms... before they even had time to get a good grip on him...
I'm counting on you to give him a better break up yonder.
Hey, you hatchet face!
Are you so almighty hungry to hang one man... that you can't wait till we get through planting this one?
Now I be consigning him to your keeping.
And I'm guessing you'll find him... the gentlest, sweetest straw boss... ever to enter the pearly gates.
Amen.
Start shoveling, cowpokes.
It's our fault.
We raised him wild.
If he'd only gone to school, like Jesse.
I thought I asked you never to mention Jesse's name again.
It's true.
You spoiled Lewt, and I let you.
Ever since he was a child... he thought rules weren't made for him.
He thought you made the rules, all of them... not just those for Spanish Bit.
It's that Indian girl.
If you hadn't brought her here... none of this would have happened.
Perhaps if your attitude toward her had been different...
It's my fault, huh?
It's my fault.
You dared to bring that Indian baggage... right here into this house, and now you try to tell me...
You get her out of here.
And what's more, get her out of here tonight!
You've screamed at me for the last time.
You made one of your sons hate you and sent him away.
You made the other one a... murderer.
Pearl will stay here just as long as I do.
Here's the money.
You better clear out of here... until this thing blows over.
Thanks, pa.
It's gonna take plenty of fixing.
So you better stay away from here... until I send you the word.
It'll take a year maybe.
Maybe more than that even.
I'm sorry to cause you all this trouble.
If you get me out of this one...
Never mind that.
I ain't counting on no reformation.
Go on. Get going fast.
Good-bye, pa.
So long, Sid.
So long, Lewt.
Take care of yourself, son.
I will, pa.
Yay, boy.
Now here's a chance to do something for pa.
I've been working on the railroad
All the live-long day
Come on, Sid. Come on.
You ain't got the mint on this game.
Sorry, Senator.
You certainly stuck your head in a noose that time.
Pearl, honey.
What you doing with that thing?
There ain't nobody here but me.
I'm gonna kill you.
That wouldn't be a very ladylike thing to do, would it... after me riding thirty miles just for a kiss?
You're gonna get what you gave Sam Pierce.
That just goes to show you... there ain't no gratitude for nothing.
If it wasn't for me, you'd be tied up... with that brokendown cowhand right now.
You might as well marry pa.
Sam Pierce was a good man, and you're a skunk.
Of all the ornery females.
One minute you're yammering... because I don't love you enough... and when I go out and show you how much I do... you're wanting to plug me.
You're my girl, honey.
I was your girl.
Anybody who was my girl is still my girl.
That's the kind of guy I am.
You know... loyal.
Stay back.
There ain't nobody gonna take my girl.
Nobody.
Never.
I'm saving you, tiger cat.
Just when I figure
I'm doing fine and dandy...
I start thinking about you, and nothing else is any good.
Here.
What's going on around here?
Come in.
Howdy, Senator.
Sorry to be busting in on you like this.
It's all right, sheriff.
How's tricks?
How's the law-breaking business?
Pretty quiet... since Lewt left.
Yeah, pretty dull without him around.
Ain't heard from him lately, have you, Senator?
Lewt? Here. Have a bite.
Don't mind if I do.
Wish I could afford this brand.
The next batch I get,
I'll send you some.
No, I ain't heard a word from Lewt... since he was attacked by that no-account Sam Pierce.
How's your other son feel about it?
I ain't got no other son.
Funny thing... one of the boys...
Lewt? I wish it was so.
Don't mind if I have a look around, do you?
No. Go ahead, sheriff.
You got your duties to do.
I'm sorry you're gonna have your trouble for nothing.
I hear Mrs. McCanles has been feeling kind of poorly.
It ain't nothing.
Just getting a little old, I guess.
You reckon the missus would mind... if I kind of looked around her room?
No. Why should she mind?
Go ahead.
Sid, ain't you moved yet?
Come in.
- Evening, ma'am.
- Sheriff.
Sorry to disturb your privacy, ma'am.
Sheriff Thompson, what is it?
It's really nothing, ma'am.
One of the boys had a fool notion... that Lewt was around here.
I'm afraid if Lewton were around...
I'd be the last person to know it.
Sorry.
Oh, my sons.
My sons.
Let's try this one.
Who's that?
Is that you, girl?
What do you want?
It's me... Sheriff Thompson.
You ain't seen Lewt, have you?
Lewt? That murdering, sneaking no-account.
I wish I could see him.
I reckon you do.
I was forgetting about Sam Pierce.
Sorry.
Good night.
See you at the hanging.
Poor old Mac.
He don't know how close he came to getting plugged.
Be quiet. It ain't safe yet.
It ain't safe for them, you mean.
There they go now.
I think I'll light out for Mexico.
Mexico?
Yeah.
I'm gonna grab me a ranch... that'll make this place look like a gopher hole.
It would be like heaven, being in Mexico together.
I'll show these heel-squatters around here... a thing or two about ranching.
You can do it, too.
- Lewt.
- Huh?
- Go saddle my pinto.
- What for?
- While I get ready.
- Ready for what?
I'm going with you, of course.
Hurry up.
You wouldn't like it down there, honey.
Sure, I will. I'll be a big help to you, too.
I can cook, and I can shoot as good as you... and I never get tired riding.
You'll try to stop me from doing things... yammering about me maybe getting shot... or start all over again about marrying somebody.
No. I promise I won't never say another word about marrying.
You'll probably want to go with me... every time I feel like going on a bust... or playing me some poker.
I wouldn't, honest.
Just so long as I could be near you.
I'm gonna live my own way.
Nobody's gonna hog-tie me.
Please.
I'll come back every once in a while... and see you, like tonight.
I'll do anything you say.
Honey, I love you. I'll see you every time I come back.
I'll send for you someday.
Honest I will.
I want to go with you.
I've got to go with you.
Will you stop your yammering?
I've got to mosey!
You love me!
You said you loved me!
Nobody else can have me because I'm yours!
I don't want anybody else!
I want you!
I'm yours!
Nobody else can have me!
You said nobody ever!
Now take me with you!
You've got to take me!
Please! Please, honey!
- Shut up!
- Lewt, honey, please!
Begging your pardon, ma'am...
I'd like to say all us boys at the Bit... is praying mighty hard that you get...
All right, Ken. All right now.
You just wait downstairs.
I'll let you know when I need you.
Will you thank the boys for me?
Tell them it isn't quite as hard to go... as they may think.
What are you talking that way for?
Anybody would think you was dying.
I'm a nuisance to you even to the end.
It's the first time you've been in this room... since that night.
Don't bring that up.
I never had the courage to discuss it with you before... but it doesn't matter now.
I've paid for my mistake.
You've hated me all through the years.
You paid? What about me, with these legs?
As useless as a hog-tied steer.
And all because you couldn't stand to be... mistress of the biggest ranch in Texas.
And why? I'll tell you why.
Nobody needed to tell me... who you was running away to that night.
Nobody needed to tell me you was running to Chavez.
That's not true. It's not true.
I was running away, but not to Scott.
Not to Scott.
True or not, you left me.
And true or not,
I went after you... like any lovesick, half-baked boy would do.
I'd give anything... anything to undo it.
I loved you, Laura Belle.
Yes, sir, I loved you.
Kept on saying to myself all through the years... that I hated you, until finally I did hate you.
In my heart,
I knew all the time... it wasn't your fault, though.
It was my fault.
It was my jealousy that made me like I was... hard and cruel-like... till I guess you had to leave me.
I never should have gone out after you that night.
But when I found out you was gone...
I got to thinking you was going to him... and I couldn't stand it.
I swore I'd stop you and bring you back.
I went crazy.
Yes, that's what it was.
I just went crazy.
And I rode through the night like a drunken Comanche.
It was my own crazy jealousy that threw me off that horse.
Jackson, forgive me.
Look at me.
You're my husband... my very own.
Hiya, boys.
- It's Jesse.
- Well, I'll be.
He's got a lot of gall, coming back here.
Where do you think you're going?
I thought I told you to keep out of my sight.
I just found out my mother is dying... and I came to see her, and I intend to see her.
They tell me you're the big noise now... with them trespassing thieves.
I hope my good fortune doesn't distress you too much.
They're even talking about putting you... up for public office.
They must pay high for double-crossers.
Senator, let's not discuss that.
I'm afraid we see things differently.
Nothing on earth would bring me here...
You're mighty lucky my men didn't take a shot at you.
That was their orders.
I was about to say that nothing on earth... would bring me back here except mother.
Is she in her room?
- No, she ain't in her room.
- Where is she?
You'll find her right in there, in a long pine box.
Hello, Vashti.
- Mr. Jesse...
- No, thank you.
But Mrs. McCanles, she said to me once...
"Vashti, you be sure and see that Mr. Jesse eats proper..."
You've been a good friend.
I shan't forget it.
Poor Mrs. McCanles.
I wonder if Miss Pearl would mind if you woke her up.
I have to go away soon.
I would like to see her.
What's the matter?
Didn't you hear me?
Yes, I heared you.
Only I'm certain sure the devil hisself... has been chasing Miss Pearl.
What on earth are you talking about?
Mrs. McCanles, she treated
Miss Pearl awful good.
She treated everybody awful good, even me.
And after she went to heaven...
Miss Pearl looks like she's had a spell or something.
She wouldn't eat nothing.
She wouldn't talk to nobody.
She just stared and stared... at Mrs. McCanles lying there so still-like.
She ran to the barn... and wouldn't come out for nobody.
Poor Pearl.
She's sad.
I listened at the barn door... and I heared her weeping something awful.
I want you to do something for me.
Yes?
Go and fix Miss Pearl a hot breakfast.
Yes!
And I want you to pack
Miss Pearl's things.
Yes, ma'am! Yes, sir!
Go away.
Vashti said you wouldn't come into the house... and I couldn't believe her.
Leave me alone.
Have you gone out of your mind?
What are you doing out here in the stable?
I bet your pa would think it was too good for me.
Never mind what he thinks.
I'm not going to allow you...
Don't you worry none about me.
I'm going away from here.
- Really? Where are you going?
- It ain't your business.
Me and Dice will get along all right.
Of course, there's Lewt.
He'll be paying a visit here... sooner or later, if I know Lewt.
That's right, I'm Lewt's girl.
You can't forget that, can you?
What makes you think that?
That's what you said that night.
You said you'd never forget it.
I did say that, didn't I?
It worried me sometimes to think I'd made so much of it.
I hope it didn't make any difference.
It didn't make no difference.
You're right. I'm Lewt's girl.
It's all I ever was.
It's all I ever could be.
You love him, don't you?
Love him? I hate him.
I wish they'd hang him.
I wish they'd hang him fast.
Yes. After all you've been through, I suppose...
It ain't just his fault.
If he sent for me tonight,
I guess I'd go to him.
Lewt's not sending for you tonight or any other night.
Listen, I have to be in Paradise Flats... a few days on business.
Do you want to wait here until I go to Austin... or would you like to come with me right now?
Me? You're just being sorry for me.
You don't have to be sorry for me none!
Listen to me.
I won't have you thinking that.
It's you who are feeling sorry for yourself.
I told Helen long ago
I wanted to get you out of here.
You told her?
Yes. She wants to be your friend.
After your ma died...
I just didn't want to go on living no more.
I know what you mean.
You'll like Helen, and she'll like you, too.
You just wait and see.
She's a lady, ain't she?
Like your ma.
She's a lady, like you're going to be.
No, I can't be no more.
Of course you can.
We'll just pretend... the whole thing was just a bad dream.
That's all it was actually, a nightmare.
If only I could be good again!
Look at me.
Remember when you wanted to learn... when you wanted me to help you?
I know just the school for you.
School?
What's the matter?
Don't you still want to learn?
I'll do anything.
I'll cook for you.
I'll wash Miss Helen's clothes.
You'll do nothing of the sort.
You'll learn to waltz and make small talk... and have pretty dresses.
Here.
For me?
From mother to you.
Jesse, I...
I wish...
I wish I could die for you.
Let's hope you never have to do that.
Is that you, Judas?
I got a message from your brother... the McCanles with the guts.
What's the matter with the bad man?
Can't he deliver his messages in person?
He has some business tonight... with a train.
He just plumb don't like trains.
So I've heard.
Have you become his assistant?
We keep in touch with each other.
You should have seen his face... when I told him you have Chavez with you.
I bet it was a lovely sight to behold.
What's the message?
He says I'm to bring her back with me... pronto.
Suppose she doesn't feel up to making the trip?
He says if she don't come back... he's coming here tomorrow morning... bright and early and get her.
You seem to be a capable messenger.
Would you mind carrying back a reply?
Not at all. Glad to oblige.
You can tell my beloved brother that I'll wait for him here.
I should have the sheriff waiting for him... but I prefer to meet him alone.
- Is that a promise?
- You're not talking to Lewt.
That's near enough.
I'm giving you one more chance.
Send Pearl out here... or I'll plug you from here to breakfast.
Just what do you think
Pearl's doing here with me?
Don't give me any... of your high and mighty noble talk, big words.
You think I wouldn't shoot you because you ain't got a gun?
I wouldn't credit you with any such compunctions.
I'm riding back to that hitching post... and then turning and starting to shoot.
It's more than you did for Sam Pierce.
Why all the consideration?
Just don't want them fancy friends of yours... to say you had a brother who shot you down in cold blood.
You're going to hang.
You're going to hang by the neck until you're dead!
You'll just go on killing and killing... till they kill you.
I hope Pearl gives you a pretty funeral.
- Who's that?
- Just me... Lem Smoot.
Come here to gloat over me, huh?
You can turn right around and get out of here.
I came because I thought maybe you'd be needing a friend.
There's a funny glow in the sky tonight, ain't there?
I remember once hearing one of them Indian legends... about how their ancestors lit bonfires in the sky... when a chief's son was a-dyin'.
He's dying?
It don't surprise me none.
Lewt always was a good shot.
It looks like them ancestors of yours... have to put out those bonfires.
What do you mean?
I guess Jesse's a little tougher than you thought.
Thank God.
I thought I knew you better than that.
I know how fond you were of those boys... and how proud of them you were.
It don't seem possible... but I must have been wrong about a whole lot of things.
Laura Belle warned me
I was spoiling Lewt... but I wouldn't listen to her.
Look. You see them plains and hills?
I was so almighty proud... of what I carved out of this country.
I figured
I was building something... for Lewt and Jesse.
And what have I got now?
Lewt a murderer, an outlaw.
Jesse...
Jesse would come back any time you want him to.
You think so?
He told me to tell you so.
I'm just a lonely old man who needs a friend... like you said.
Whoa!
Here's your luggage, miss.
You're Miss Helen, ain't you?
And you're Pearl.
He's been asking for you.
How is he?
He's... gonna be all right.
Thank heaven.
I shouldn't cry. I know it.
He wouldn't like it.
You couldn't do nothing he wouldn't like.
You're very fond of Jesse, aren't you?
After my pa...
There wasn't never nobody good to me like my pa...
Except Mrs. McCanles... and Jesse.
My dear.
You will come and live with us, won't you?
I want you to.
Yes?
I'm glad you and Jesse are... bespoken.
Thank you.
Hi, Pearl.
How's the hero?
I just heard he was gonna pull through.
Tough luck, ain't it?
But Lewt will get him next time.
You can bank on that.
- Next time?
- Yeah.
Next time.
I got good news for you.
Yeah? What is it?
It's from Lewt.
He says you got to hightail it out of here... if you want to kiss him good-bye... before he beats it across the border.
You mean it? Where is he?
I kind of figured you'd like that.
He's hiding out at Squaw's Head Rock.
You got that? Squaw's Head Rock.
Just fire two shots when you get there.
I got it. Squaw's Head Rock.
Take the Apache trail to the mission.
Any Indian there can tell you how to get to Buffalo Ridge.
And then you...
You got a good horse?
It's a couple of days' ride.
Sure. I got my pinto.
You know, the one Lewt gave me before I was his girl.
Hiya, Pearl!
Here I am!
I've been waiting for you!
Hello, honey!
I'll be right down!
Stay there!
I can't see you!
Can you see me?
You... double-crossing... bobcat!
I guess that does it.
You got me that time.
I'm done for.
You're lying.
You're lying, like you always do!
I can't shoot no more, honey.
Honest.
I'm not scared of you.
I'm coming up after you.
All right, then. Come on up!
No use in my... lying no more.
I'm through.
You hear me?
Yeah.
I'm dying.
I...
I'm going... fast.
Are you...
Ain't you coming up?
I want to see you.
I got to see you.
Where are you?
Where are you?
Hurry!
Please!
I... I got to... hold you... just once more.
I love you.
I love you!
Hurry. Hurry!
Hurry, honey.
Hold on! Hold on!
Hurry!
Wait for me!
Wait for me.
Where are you?
You always said you could shoot.
I never believed you.
I love you.
I love you.
Don't cry, honey.
Don't cry.
I had to do it.
Of course you did.
Let me hold you.
Let me...
Just hold me.
Hold me once more.
Little... bobcat.
Jesse James was a lad who killed many a man
He robbed the Glendale train
He took from the rich and give to the poor
He'd a heart and a hand and a brain
That alarm bell's something new.
They must have stayed up all night trying to figure out a way to discourage us.
Sorry I dropped the money.
- Forget it.
- How's it look?
Clean through.
You know what they say.
When you save a man's life, you, uh... assume his responsibilities.
There's only a hundred dollars on my head.
That ain't much when you say it fast.
We got a long ways to go.
Think you can hang on?
- Sure. Where we goin'?
- Home.
It ain't I'm not charitable... but Bob Ford's all healed now and able to git.
Says in the paper they're selling a handsome cuspidor secured by a screw to...
He just spells trouble, him and his brother Charlie.
Why don't they leave you alone?
You got out of the wrong side of the bed all week, Zee.
I ain't been to bed since you carried
Bob in here with a bullet in his back.
He's a good boy.
Been ridin' with me for a length of time.
Been living here for a length of time too.
Six months.
I don't mind your brother Frank, but them Fords.
You've been a devoted wife, Zee.
And I don't say that you speak falsely.
I promise. Right after the...
What is it, Jess?
I only see one rider.
Charlie Ford.
You can look at that map now if you want to.
I spoke my piece.
What's ailing her?
That's funny.
I wonder what happened.
Why didn't Frank ride in with ya?
He stayed behind to study the roads we'll have to use.
We picked a good bank in Dodge City.
The four of us can handle it without any trouble.
- No alarm bells this time.
- When are we to meet him?
Eleven days from today.
The bank'll be fat.
He'll be here.
The west bank of the Arkansas
River, couple of miles from Wichita.
- Ah.
- Thought you might be hungry.
Thanks, Zee.
May as well sit.
We're gonna eat.
I stopped by in town to find out what was new.
Guess who's there, Bob.
Your girl.
Cynthy?
- In St. Joe?
- Yeah. Still playacting too.
At the Opera House.
Had a show last night, I was told.
- If you're recognized, Bob...
- They don't know us in St. Joe, Mr. Howard.
Watch out for Marshal Craig.
And don't get into a gunfight.
That's not my intention.
You love Cynthy, don't ya?
Since I was old enough to crawl.
Then why don't you marry her and settle down and buy land?
You're a farmer at heart.
We all are.
By the way, Cynthy, there's a very good friend of mine... a gentleman... well, someone I know... and he's seen the show every night this week.
- He says...
- We only opened last night.
Yeah. So... So we did.
Well, maybe he saw the rehearsals.
Anyhow, he's most anxious to see you.
And he says...
Veronica, will you make up some more of that sugar and water?
I didn't like the stuff Harry fixed.
Well, look.
He's a very important man.
He's the... silver king of Colorado or something. And he... he feel...
Harry, how could you expect anyone to back our show if they've seen it?
Well, he's very fond of heartwarming dramas.
- Oh, thanks. Oh, a little more water, please.
- Now look.
Uh, how would it be if
I brought him here sometime this week?
- If you like.
- Maybe, uh, tomorrow.
Or tonight. Or, uh...
Just a minute.
- Mr. Kelley.
- Yes.
Mr. Kelley, this is Miss Waters.
Uh, Veronica.
- How do you do, Miss Waters?
- Mr. Kelley.
Well, what do you favor?
Light opera?
- Oh, uh...
- Uh, heavy opera.
- Oh, yes. I, uh...
- Maybe heartwarming dramas.
- Well, that...
- Don't forget Lily Langtry.
Of course. Lily Langtry.
Oh, please, Cynthy. We...
Miss Waters, Mr. Kane, you don't know this... but I've seen a lot of your shows.
- I saw you in Joplin, uh...
- Maybe Kansas City?
- Oh, yes, yes. Kansas City.
- Jefferson City too, huh?
- Oh, yes. Jefferson City too. Yes.
- That's fine.
Seen lots of your shows. Uh, all bad.
But don't let that bother you, Miss Waters.
I'm sure it wasn't your fault or Mr. Kane's.
Just, uh, bad plays.
But I'd, uh, like to talk to you a little more.
Uh, maybe I could see you after the show, hmm?
Mr. Kelley, if you're gonna put a nickel in this show, you'll lose it.
- Oh?
- We don't make money.
Oh, Cynthy.
- What is it, Veronica?
- It's Mr. Miller.
He's outside.
Hello, Harry.
They want you outside, Harry.
Cynthia.
Uh, Mr. Kelley. Mr. Miller.
- Hello, Miller.
- Hi.
- Are you a member of the company here?
- No. My business is prospecting.
What, in here?
I like Miss Waters's acting very much.
- Do you have a match, Mr. Miller?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Miss Waters, don't be worried about me losing any money in your show.
I don't have any.
But I'd still like to talk to you again.
Cynthy.
Cynthy Waters.
If you'd listened to me three years ago... we could have been married.
You're a good farmer.
Farmer.
After the next bank-
And what if lead poisoning sets in first?
Mm-mmm. When I marry, it won't be to a man on the run.
But, Cynthy, I...
Look at Jesse's wife.
Last time I saw her hiding out in a mountain cabin, she looked 50 instead of 30.
I don't want that kind of a life.
Maybe...
Maybe you don't feel for me the way she feels about Jess.
I'm still in Missouri.
Bob.
Yeah.
When you're free, I'll marry you.
All right.
I'm leaving the James Gang for good.
I know Mr. Meredith. He... He's the prosecuting attorney ofJackson County.
Tell him.
Tell him I'm... gonna be a farmer.
You've been gone long enough to get 10 pardons.
What did Meredith say?
Pumped Cynthy livid trying to find out where I'm hiding.
Said if I gave myself up, he'd see I only got 20 years.
Twenty years.
Think they may have followed you back from St. Louis?
No.
- Where's Jess?
- Took Zee and the kids to church.
Did Meredith tell her what the governor just came out with?
Everybody in St. Joe's been talkin' about it.
- Don't seem to worry Jess none.
- What?
Amnesty for any of the gang who turns in Jess, dead or alive.
- Amnesty?
- Yeah. Act of pardon.
Means if you're on the run and you turn in Jess, you're free.
- No time in jail?
- Not even a day.
Means you could walk down the street and nobody'd bother ya.
Yeah. It means just that.
Means I could get married.
Yeah. $10,000 goes with that, dead or alive.
Means we could buy a farm.
Nobody could take Jess alive.
That'd be suicide.
She wouldn't have to tear up old wheat sacks to make herself a pair of drawers.
- Bob, what are you...
- I'm... thinkin' of Cynthy.
What about Frank James?
What'd you do that for?
Meanin' I'm afraid of Frank?
Ain't ya?
Sure.
If I want to think I'm afraid or say I'm afraid...
I'll think it and I'll say it.
Nothing gonna stop me from marryin' Cynthy.
Nothin'.
Hey, Bob.
Bob.
Hey, hurry up, Bob.
That's wonderful.
That's more like it.
It's nice and warm now.
Be back in a minute.
- Bob.
- Yeah?
Pick up that blanket, will ya?
It's a Colt.45.
Improved pattern.
Silver-mounted, pearl handle.
It's beautiful.
It's loaded.
Sure. When I give a present,
I like to make it complete.
Well, go ahead, Bob.
What are you waitin' for?
There's my back.
Here. Scrub it.
Hey, Bob.
I'm goin' to town.
I'll see you in the mornin'.
What are you doin' pokin' around out there, Bob?
Come on in. Let's talk.
It's kind of lonesome without Frank around.
It ain't lawful. Even folks in town what don't like Jesse James is sayin' it ain't lawful.
Don't you fret about it, Zee.
It's just as if the governor was advertisin' to hire an assassin to go and kill you unawares.
I ain't killed yet, Zee.
I pick my friends, and I know 'em.
No friend of mine would swallow that immunity offered by the governor.
Ain't that...
What are you so nervous for?
Did Cynthy turn you down?
Yeah. Kind... Kinda.
Think I'll go in to St. Joe and buy a new horse.
You can fetch the children home from school with ya.
Yeah. I'll do that, Zee.
I'm tired.
I guess maybe Zee's right.
Time I settled down.
That's what you ought to do, Bob...
get yourself a wife and a home.
That's what I'm aimin' to do, Jess.
It's only 11:00.
Think I'll wait until later this afternoon and go in town.
It's an awful hot day.
Feel kind of naked without my weapons.
No, sir.
Nothin' like putterin' around a home.
There's no 10,000.
The governor didn't conspire with you to assassinate Jesse.
The reward was $5,000 for his apprehension.
Five for conviction.
All you get is 500.
Bob, you ought to see the way folks look at me when I walk down the street.
You ought to see 'em, Bob.
- That $10,000?
- What happened to the rest of it?
- What's the difference?
I got enough to buy Cynthy a ring... a diamond ring. A great big one.
- You can be best man.
- Oh, not me.
I'm not hanging around waiting for a ball from Frank James's gun... or buckshot from some of the folks what don't like what happened to Jess.
- Scared?
- He'll get you, Bob.
He'll get both of us.
I'm ridin' out.
Stake me, Bob?
- Here's a hundred.
- Thanks, Bob.
- Watch yourself.
- Yeah.
I still got enough to buy Cynthy a big diamond ring.
Miss Waters.
Miss Waters.
I beg your pardon.
It's Kelley.
John Kelley.
I, uh, was talking to the manager,
Mr. Kane.
He told me you changed your mind.
You're not going to leave the show.
I'm glad to hear it.
There's something troubling you, Miss Waters.
Uh, can't I help?
I'm, uh... living at the North Hotel if there's anything I can do to help.
John Kelley, North Hotel.
Cynthy.
Cynthy.
- What's the matter?
- How could you have done it?
Jesse, your best friend.
How, Bob? How?
- I didn't do it for the reward.
- I know, I know, I know!
Then why are you looking at me like I'm poison?
Can't you understand what's happened?
You got me kind of all mixed up.
When you pulled that trigger, all the love I had for you...
- But I done it for you.
- Don't say that! Don't ever say that!
- But it's true, Cynthy.
- Can't you see how wrong it was?
- It was legal.
- It was murder.
Don't look at it that way.
You ought to be proud of me.
The governor's grateful. The law says it's legal.
Don't look at it no other way.
What other way can I look at it?
Cynthia.
I ain't on the run no more.
I can walk down the street, and nobody... not even the whole militia... can bother me.
That's what the shooting means to you?
What it means to me...
It means I'm a free man.
Ain't that what you wanted, Cynthy?
Ain't it?
'Tweren't easy shootin' Jess.
It weren't easy.
But there's nothin'
I wouldn't do to have you.
Nothin'.
Your weddin' ring.
I can't.
- Cynthy!
- You're hurting me.
What do you think you're doing to me?
Listen, Cynthy.
When I killed Jess, I had a cause.
If you turn against me, I got no reason.
The way you did it, Bob...
Oh, can't you understand?
The love I had for you was...
No, it ain't that.
Something else has turned you from me.
I ain't a murderer.
So there's gotta be a reason.
Kelley! That's who it is! Kelley!
You're talkin' crazy.
What was he doin' here when I came in?
Did you see him much when I was in jail?
- Stop it!
- I knew there had to be a reason.
I knew.
Bob, you're wrong about Kelley!
He's got nothin'to do with us!
Come in.
You've got to leave St. Joe at once... right away.
- I have to what?
- Bob Ford's gonna kill you.
Yeah? Why?
Because he thinks we're in love.
- Oh, he does, huh?
- Yes.
- How does he know?
- There's no time to waste. You've got to leave.
Is that, uh... Is that an order?
Oh, it's a fact that'll save your life.
- Or, uh, his?
- Oh, please, Mr. Kelley.
Just a minute, Miss Waters.
We, uh, hardly know each other. Up to now...
There's no time to...
You're not giving me any chance to get to know ya.
You barge in here and tell me I have to run away... just because that hotheaded Ford says we're lovers.
- Don't make sense.
- His guns do.
Yeah. That does give him quite an edge.
- He's dangerous.
- Why?
Because he killed his best friend?
Look, I'm telling you to go because I don't want any more bloodshed.
- He's jealous and...
- Was, uh, Jesse James in love with you too?
- It was for the amnesty.
- And not the reward.
- He wanted to be free to marry me.
- Look. We're wasting time.
He's on his way up here now looking for you.
I don't think he'll shoot unless I turn my back.
He killed Jesse James because of me.
He didn't want money.
He wanted me.
Just as if I pulled that trigger myself.
And now he thinks we're lovers.
Oh, don't you see, Mr. Kelley?
I don't want any more murders because of me.
Please help me.
I'm sorry. I didn't understand.
Then you'll go at once? Right now?
Do you love him?
Yes.
I don't believe you.
You couldn't love him.
I don't like what I'm doing, but... if it's what you want, it's good enough for me.
Come on.
Eight.
- Ten.
- All right.
There goes another four bits.
So you really know the whole clan, hmm?
All of them. The mother of the Dalton boys was Adelaide Younger- half sister of the Younger brothers, cousins of the James boys.
Six.
Nine.
- So they're all kind of related.
- Just one big family.
Cole and Jim and Bob and John Younger and...
Grat and Emmett Dalton and Frank and Jess... and Jim Reed and Belle Starr and their son.
Four.
Eight.
You're just having a run of bad luck.
Yeah. Uh... would you mind letting me look at that.45 now?
You know... this gun'll probably end up in a museum someday.
Not while I'm alive to tote it.
Uh, curtain'll go up at the usual time.
You better hurry up.
I mean, take your time. I'll see you later.
I'll be around.
Been waitin' for you, Cynthy.
I'm sorry for what I said.
I was wrong about Kelley.
He checked out of town.
You ain't sore, are ya?
No.
You know, I've been thinkin' about us, and... it's wrong for us to get married now.
I know what you were trying to tell me without hurting my feelings.
- Do you, Bob?
- Sure. It ain't right for a man... to get married if he ain't got enough money to take care of his wife.
So I got myself a job.
- On a farm?
- No.
Well, whatever it is, I'm proud of you.
Well, I... I hope you feel that way when I tell you what it is.
Do you want me to guess?
I'm gonna be... a performer.
And I'm going to rideJumbo in Barnum Circus in New York.
Mr. Kane and I talked it over.
I'm going to be what he called a... a special added attraction.
Well?
Well, every night I'm gonna...
I'm gonna show folks how I shot Jess.
No.
That's what I aim to do.
Have you lost your mind?
How can you put yourself up li... like a freak?
- People will pay-
- I don't care about people.
I'm talking about you... Bob Ford.
How do you feel about it?
You mean you're going to use Jesse as a...
Oh, Bob!
What's the difference? He's dead.
I gotta make money so we can get married, and farmin' will take too long.
I don't regret what I done,
'cause it was to have you.
I don't regret what I aim to do...
'cause the whole thing's kind of tied up in one big reason.
Oh, I... I can't stomach you using Jesse's ghost.
You're right about that, Cynthy.
Look, I ain't much good with words, but... seems to me that real honest love is like ghosts... which everybody hears about and few people see.
Well, I see it, I feel it and I got it.
If that can't make you see what's driving me on, nothin' can.
I just want a chance to prove
I ain't no murderer... traitor or assassin.
It's a hot day.
Think I'll dust off some of these pictures.
Blank.
A wanderin' minstrel man I am
I sing my songs in trade
And in the course of travelin'
My fortune I have made
If I sing a liltin' air
To any purty miss
Even though she may be shy
She pays me with a kiss
Now in this room
I feel an urge
To tell you what I think
If someone pays the cost
I'll trade
A ballad "fer" a drink
Give him a drink.
I just blew into town.
I can use a drink, mister.
I'll sing you one everybody likes.
A song everybody likes.
Jesse James was a lad that killed many a man
He robbed the Glendale train
He took from the rich and give to the poor
He'd a heart and a hand and a brain
Young Jesse had a wife who mourned for his life
Three children, they were brave
But the dirty little coward what shot Mr. Howard
Has laid Jesse dead in his grave
'Cause it was Robert Ford the dirty little cow...
Anything wrong, mister?
I'm Robert Ford.
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Ford.
I didn't know.
So everybody likes it, huh?
Oh, nobody likes it very much,
Mr. Ford.
Go on. Sing it.
- Oh, please, Mr. Ford.
- I wanna hear it.
'Cause it was Robert Ford the dirty little cow...
- I can't.
- Sing it.
'Cause it was Robert Ford the dirty little coward
Wonder how he feels
He ate of Jesse's bread and slept in Jesse's bed
Then he laid Jesse dead in his grave
Jesse James sat at home on a Saturday night
Talkin' to his family brave
Robert Ford come around like a th-thief in the night
And laid Jesse dead in his grave
No man you ever saw on the side of the law
Could take Jesse dead or alive
'Twas his friend Robert Ford who collected that reward
By shootin' Jesse James on the sly
Young Jesse had a wife who mourned for his life
Three children, they were brave
But the... dirty little coward what shot Mr. Howard
Has laid Jesse dead
In his grave
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
Don't shoot.
I'm outta bullets.
Why pick me for target practice?
You shot Jesse James.
Anybody would shoot you becomes the biggest gunman in the country.
Silver! Silver!
Silver! Silver!
Silver! Colorado!
Creede, Colorado!
Silver!
Silver! Silver!
Silver! Colorado!
Creede, Colorado!
Oh! I wanted to find you.
You've got to get out of town.
I overheard some men talking.
You're the target for every gun-happy man around here.
They think killing you will make them famous.
It isn't safe for you here anymore.
- It'll be the same wherever I go.
- You could change your name.
No. I'm not gonna do what Jesse did.
But you can't go on like this.
Every minute, I expect someone to shoot you.
So do I.
What are we gonna do, Bob?
Well, there's a silver strike in Colorado.
- Maybe if I go there, I might...
- Please.
No. I'm not gonna change my name.
- I didn't mean that.
- What did you mean?
It's about us.
Cynthy, it might take a short time.
It might take long.
If I strike it rich, I'll send for you.
- But, Bob, I...
- I'm leavin' tonight.
Howdy, mister.
Howdy. My horse is beat.
- Brush him off.
- I'll do that.
- Feed 'im too.
- I'll feed him.
You got a clean stall for my horse?
Why, sure.
You look like you could use a clean stall yourself.
Where do I find one?
There's not a room in the whole town, mister.
Unless you can talk yourself into one down at the Silver King... and that's down the street to the left.
You can't miss it.
It's a sure thing.
It's worth a million.
- If I could just start right along this...
- Sorry, Lucky.
Nobody'll grubstake you on that piece of ground.
Well, uh, could you loan me a half-dollar?
No. You owe too much already.
- How about a room?
- Filled up.
Unless you want the bridal suite... a hundred dollars a night.
Say, how'd you like to sell that ring?
I got a little more than $40.
How about that room?
Well, we're doubling up.
If you can get the fella here in 124 to share his with you... it'll be $10 for the night.
- Where is it?
- Upstairs to the right.
It's open.
Hey, I know you.
You're... You're Kelley.
- Hi, Miller.
- I got no place to sleep.
You mind if I share your room?
It's big enough.
Help yourself.
- How are things in St. Joe?
- Quiet.
Guess everybody and his brother's in town.
Yeah, that's the way these booms are.
It's lucky it's this time of year.
No snow on the ground.
Makes it easier to find the veins.
- This your first crack at it?
- Yeah.
Gonna find it pretty rough, Miller.
There's a lot of old-timers here know every rock and hole in Colorado.
Well, before I share your room,
I oughta tell you my name ain't Miller.
That's none of my business.
I ain't ashamed of it.
It's Ford... Robert Ford.
How about the room?
It's still big enough.
You, uh, through with this?
No. Leave it there.
Beating madly
I love you
Yeah, the boys have been talking about you again, Mr. Kelley.
- Everybody likes you, and...
- No chance.
It's good-payin' money.
They'd make you marshal in five minutes.
I've been kickin' around too long to hang up in one place.
Is that what you want... endin' up like most of these broken-down sourdoughs?
I got no reason to stick around this town.
Sure wish you'd change your mind.
All the storekeepers think highly of you.
Joe, all peacemakers are targets.
That's not for me.
- What have you got to eat?
- Sweet corn, cornmeal mush... cornpone with cracklings and corn whiskey.
I'll have it.
Beautiful dreamer
Wake unto me
- Say, I, uh...
- You remember Cynthy Waters?
Yeah, I remember.
I'm gonna bring her back a mountain of money.
Is that what she wants?
Mm-hmm. We're gonna get married when I strike it.
Beautiful dreamer
Queen of my song
List while I woo thee
With soft melody
- Gone are the cares of
- That's what Cynthy used to sing to me.
Life's busy throng
Beautiful dreamer awake unto me
Beautiful dreamer
Awake unto me
Yahoo!
Yahoo! I made it!
Yahoo!
Kelley! Kelley, my lad, I made it.
Look at it.
A ton'll carry $200.
- Yahoo!
- Be careful now, Soapy. Be careful.
Don't let anybody know where.
You're drunk.
Sure, I'm drunk.
Come on. Let's all get drunk.
- Right, Soapy.
- Ajug of your best for my friend Soapy.
- Those men with him, do you know 'em?
- Nope.
Looks like they're gonna strike it rich tonight too.
A man gets that drunk, it's his own neck. Whiskey.
All you gotta do is sign, Soapy, and we give you 500 in cash.
- Sign what?
- We're buyin' your rights for 500.
- In cash.
- Remember?
Huh? Oh, yeah. Sure, sure, sure.
Come on, Soapy.
I'm gonna take you home.
Go on, Kelley! Give it to 'im!
Attaboy!
I don't mind you pullin' a gun on a man when he ain't got one.
That's his own fault.
Anything can happen to a man when he ain't got his guns.
That old drunk there, if you want his mine...
why don't you shoot him and take it?
I don't like a man going around the back way and pulling a sneak.
Kelley, you-you're great.
Come on, Soapy.
I'm gonna take you home.
Yahoo! Yahoo!
- Where's Kelley?
- He got up early.
- Where'd he go?
- He checked out.
Where's Kelley?
Nobody tells anybody where they're workin' a claim.
I ain't anybody!
- He stole my ring.
- Kelley wouldn't.
He checked out.
Bring me some coffee.
Heard what you did for me last night, Mr. Ford... and I wanna tell ya it was decent of ya.
And you're wrong about Kelley.
- I think maybe...
- Who asked you to think?
You're here to make a strike, ain't ya?
You got a piece of ground?
Ever do any prospectin'?
You know, for an old man, you ask a lot of questions.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Everybody wants to live long, but nobody wants to be old.
I'm old and a little tired.
Well, I just left a bed.
You can have it.
No, I mean tired of workin' my mine.
I was thinkin', maybe...
Look, you don't have to give me a reward for shootin' them two fellas.
Who said anything about a reward?
You'll have to work.
And you can't tell. We're liable to run into Kelley anywhere along the river.
What do you wanna cut me in for?
You... You struck it.
What do you need anyone for?
The bartender told me why you was here for diggings.
Most of us just want the money.
You want it to get hitched.
That's the highest point in a man's life, Mr. Ford... gettin' hitched.
- What are you drivin' at?
- There ain't no place so high... that you can't reach it with a burro's load of pay dirt.
You know, you don't look like a man that makes much sense, but you sure do.
Why sit here eatin' your heart out waitin' for a man you think stole your ring... when you've got a chance to win gold and wear it or hoard it... or spend it or lend it or lose it... or use it to get hitched?
I got nothin' to work with.
You got hands.
Better than hardtack, ain't it?
And I shot that mountain lion, which was only 20 feet behind Soapy.
We've been digging for weeks, and we're going to keep on digging.
Nighttime is when it's-
Well, it's nighttime.
What'll you do if he does strike it rich?
I don't know.
I don't remember if it was
Shakespeare or Aristotle... but one of them once said...
"No one loves the man whom he fears".
Telegram.
- For me?
- Uh, no. For you, Miss Cynthy.
I seen you wear black before, but now it... it kinda makes you seem taller.
Hello, Bob.
Yeah, but not taller maybe. You're...
You're lookin' kinda different.
Perhaps I'm tired.
Yeah.
Your telegram said you'd be arriving at 6:00.
Oh, it was the other way around.
I said we'd be leaving at 6:00.
Yeah, I... I'm kinda mixed up.
Oh, I see you brought him with you.
Harry had a little tough luck in St. Joe, and he thought...
Well, as long as this is a boomtown... maybe they'd like to pay money for a real heartwarmin' drama.
I hope you got yourself a new leading lady, Harry...
'cause Cynthy and I, we...
Come on.
I got a surprise for ya.
What's the matter, Cynthy?
Don't you like it?
I guess you're all wore out from the trip.
You know, I sent to Denver for a dressmaker to make you a weddin' dress.
You've gone to a lot of trouble, Bob, and I...
You know, people'll see us courtin'.
It'll be the biggest weddin' in...
No, it ain't the trip that's tired you.
There's somethin' bothering you.
When somethin' bothers us... We gotta talk things out when somethin' bothers us.
Come in.
Go on.
All right, tell him.
I stole your ring when you went to sleep that night.
Give it to him.
Go on. Get outta here.
Don't ever call me a thief.
He can put that ring on your finger now, Mrs. Ford.
I'm not Mrs. Ford yet.
You go freshen up.
You must be tired, huh?
I'll fix up a room for Kane and myself.
You go freshen up.
That clerk shot outta here like a bullet.
I knowed the minute you blew back, you'd clear that up.
He did the same thing last year in Jefferson City.
When you grabbed him behind his desk,
I sure thought he was a dead one.
- How'd you make out with your claim?
- No good.
You should've come in with me and Ford.
He's rich now, real rich.
- You need any grubstakin'?
- Nope.
You got any money?
You goin' out to hammer them hills again?
- Got a cigar?
- Sure.
How long did you say it would take to make me marshal?
- Five minutes.
- You'd better tell your friends.
Fella's gotta eat.
Let me have my bag.
You got a reason to stay in town now, eh?
- Yep.
- Hey, did you see the bride?
She's no bride yet.
Uh, Veronica... better wait with those bags.
Have you told him yet?
- I couldn't.
- Why are you wasting time?
I'm not particularly fond of him, but even a traitor like Bob Ford...
- Harry.
- Yes, even he deserves consideration.
- Well, it isn't easy.
- Why, of course it isn't easy... but you've got to tell him the truth.
Tell him that you're on your way to Denver, that we're going to open a new show.
Cynthy.
Perhaps I've exaggerated now and then about... your acting ability.
But your honesty, that's a quality I've...
I've always admired in you.
Thank you, Harry.
So you'll tell him you're not going to marry him. Now.
I can't.
Why? Why? Why can't you?
I'm afraid of him.
All right, Veronica, you can take the bags in.
Well, I...
I guess I'm stuck in this town too.
Oh.
You heard him, Veronica.
I bought her 20 dresses and... Say, you oughta try getting married too, Soapy.
Listen, Soapy.
Think what we could do here.
I'm offering you a chance to invest in the first professional theater in the town of Creede.
- How much gold will it take?
- We could make it a double wedding.
Just you and me and...
Gold is nothing but the last corruption of degenerate man.
But to be just a little corrupt for the sake of art, that I wouldn't mind.
- How much?
- I bought her hats and dresses and shoes and...
How much gold will it take?
Now you're talking like an intelligent bachelor.
Anyone can get married.
Mr. Soapy, I just want...
I just... I just wanted to...
- Hello.
- Hello.
You're going to marry him tomorrow, huh?
Well, not tomorrow.
You're not ever going to marry him, because I won't let you. Pack up.
You can't come in here and tell me what to do.
You didn't let that stop you when you ordered me out of St. Joe.
You're making it worse for me.
Cynthy.
We don't need talk to understand each other.
You don't love him.
I can't hurt him.
Then why did you come here?
Tell me.
- Well, I...
- Why?
I... I wanted to tell him to his face.
What were you going to say?
What were you going to say? What?
I'm sorry for you.
I could never marry you.
I don't love you, Bob.
I don't love you. I really don't love you.
I don't love you, Bob.
I don't love you.
I really don't love you.
- I don't love...
- Cynthy!
- It's Kelley.
- Oh, Kelley!
- It's Veronica.
- No.
She's not here.
Frank! Frank James.
Hello, Cynthy. Sit down.
Sit down, Mr. Kelley.
I'm not lookin' for you.
I'm lookin' for Bob Ford.
I tried to climb into Bob's room, but his window was locked.
- If you kill him, you'll hang.
- Shut up. Sit down.
I didn't mean to listen to what you were saying, Cynthy.
I, uh, got a little reckless and knocked over a bottle of perfume.
Ain't used to female things, you know.
- I know how you feel...
- Shut up.
Soon as we hear the verdict, we'll get back to work.
I still can't figure out how Kelley got the best of Frank James.
Mr. Kelley happens to be a very-
Well, he's a very smart man.
What do you think they'll give Frank?
Ten years maybe?
I don't know.
What number do you...
What number do you wanna rehearse?
Maybe 20 years, maybe.
They'll never keep him in jail, Bob.
He's been there a week, but they won't keep him long.
You're right. The trial is over.
- Uh, waiter.
- How many years did they-
He's free.
I don't understand. There wa...
There was a price on his head.
There is, Bob, but not in Colorado.
I don't have to kill you.
But I'm gonna tell you something that will kill you.
You're aimin'to marry Cynthy.
When you put your lips up close to hers, she'll be kissing you...
but she'll be thinking of Kelley.
It's you she's sorry for, but it's him she wants.
Anyone seen the marshal?
I kept away because of you, but I...
I don't like this hiding from him.
Everybody knows what he'll do the minute he sees you.
I've gotta figure out some way to talk to him.
- But he's crazy with jealousy.
- I'm not gonna run away from something I want.
- Then take me away. Anywhere.
Let's leave right... - You wouldn't like that.
Do you want to spend the rest of your life behind a bolted door?
They tell me
Ford's on his way over here.
- Well, I've gotta talk to him.
- He'll kill you.
I've got to try and talk some sense into him.
I hope what I'm going to do now turns out right... for all of us.
I hope so.
Someday you'll need my love at last
You got your back to me, Kelley!
Turn around!
Turn around, Kelley!
Turn around!
I ain't waitin', Kelley!
Turn around!
Kelley! Turn around!
Go on. Shoot.
I ain't waitin', Kelley!
Turn around!
- Keep away from your gun and listen.
- I'm listenin'.
I was hopin' I could talk some sense into you without the help of-
- I'm still listenin'.
- She's not gonna marry you.
She came here to tell you that.
We both love her- you in your way... and me... me in my way.
Some men will kill for a woman.
Some won't.
You won't
'cause you don't love her enough.
He just wouldn't listen to me.
- Aw, Cynthy.
- Shh.
I... I want to tell you somethin'
I ain't never told anyone.
Oh, Bob.
I'm sorry for what I done to Jess.
I loved him.
You wanna get rich in this country you oughta marry a hen! - I did.
OnIy she can't Iay no eggs!
No, not for 200. Not for any amount.
I gotta have a room.
- I teII ya, I just ain't got a room.
Wait a minute.
Guest just checkin' out.
Lee Marcus.
Take 24, right on down the haII.
Much obIiged.
Wait a minute, FIapjack! Wait!
What you aiming to do?
I'm gettin' me a gun, some Iiquor and a goId commissioner.
Snake juice and pIenty of it! - What you doin' in town? CIean Peter out?
If we had, them mangy warthogs wouIdn't have jumped us. - You too?
Sure. We were just workin' aIong kind of peacefuI-Iike when at Ieast 20 of 'em jumped us.
What chance did we have?
You stiII got your gun, ain't ya?
You mean FIapjack was chased off his cIaim and didn't do nothin'?
Oidn't do nothin'?
He poIIuted their guts with Ianguage that shouIdn't be inside of no man!
But what good did it do?
They had the Iaw with 'em.
What are we, a Iot of sIeepin' Indians to take a thing Iike this Iayin' down?
What you gonna do about it?
- I'II teII ya what I'm gonna do.
I'm gettin' me a gun. And anyone that comes aIong'II see pIenty of action.
If it's action you boys want the games are open.
The roof's the Iimit, and if you're reaIIy pIayfuI I'II take that off too.
Cherry, that ain't the kind of action we mean. - Is there some other kind?
Yes, Ma'am. They stoIe my cIaim, and I ain't gonna take it sittin' down!
Oh, you're gonna do some shootin', FIapjack?
You bet I am!
And some hittin' what I shoot at!
Now, now, now.
Maybe we better think this over.
I don't wanna find you under that oId sycamore, with your feet dangIing.
But you grubstaked me to this cIaim yourseIf. - So I have a say in it.
You and Banty have another drink and stay here.
They jump from one cIaim to another,
Iike grasshoppers, Bronco. - Yeah.
Seems you can take away a man's cIaim just by fiIing an affidavit.
So far, they're onIy the smaII ones.
- Meaning what?
No reason their system can't work with the big cIaims. - Such as the Midas?
With both owners away, why not?
A visit to the goId commissioner ...?
What's his name? - AIexander McNamara.
ShaII I ... drop in on him?
- No.
First Iet's do a IittIe checking up. My way.
Ravishing as usuaI, Miss MaIotte.
- GIad to see you're out of jaiI.
A temporary arrangement onIy. I'II be back in again by nightfaII, I daresay.
WeII, weII, Miss MaIotte!
It's certainIy a pIeasure to see you.
- Thank you, Mr Montrose.
I want some information about FIapjack Simm's cIaim.
Simms?
Here we are. That's been reIocated.
Oh, it has? Under whose name?
Why, a Mr CIark and a Mr Bennett.
We have their affidavit right here.
Oh yes, here we are.
Now, see ...
Can I see this, Monte?
You won't mind if I borrow this, wiII you, Monte?
Nice pIace to keep my records, but the question is, what about access?
You got to that one easy enough.
- Oidn't I?
I'm Cherry MaIotte. I suppose you're
Mr McNamara. - G.C. GoId Commissioner.
TeII the marshaI
I want to see him, Montrose.
Putting me in jaiI, Mr McNamara?
- Serious business, steaIing records.
As serious as cIaim jumping?
Got some particuIar case in mind?
The cIaim of FIapjack Simms.
I know he made the originaI discovery.
CIark and Bennett swear they fiIed in the spring, but they weren't here yet.
So I want this affidavit as evidence.
Strong taIk. But I'm here to protect the interests of the smaII owner.
But if you happened to be smart you couId do yourseIf a Iot of good, couIdn't you?
I'm wondering just how smart you are.
WeII, I've been educated.
- So have I.
I don't care how you operate ...
I mean, with two exceptions.
The Simms cIaim.
- And a certain mine, the Midas.
That's puts us into the big money.
Got an interest in the Midas?
Stock?
- No, not exactIy.
Oh, personaI. One of the partners?
GIennister? - We're acquainted.
I don't know much about him, but
I'd say he has good taste. - Thanks.
He does aII right in other ways too.
Not a man to be pushed around.
Big feIIer, eh?
Might he make it interesting if I wanted to move into his territory?
CouId be tough going, mister.
- But worth it.
So?
What's this I hear about me arresting Miss MaIotte?
No. I want to see CIark and Bennett.
A few questions I want to ask them.
WeII, Cherry, I ... - Some other time.
- You'II aIways be weIcome.
You work fast, commissioner.
- Thank you.
And since you have a safer pIace to store papers, you better keep this.
WeII, I couId be wrong.
If I came into the Northern some night, wouId you show me around?
Show you around? Sure.
If it couId be done.
Goodbye.
And I've been here aII this time ...
Somebody shouId have toId me.
About CIark and Bennett?
- Yeah ... No!
About Cherry MaIotte.
You met McNamara?
- Let's say he met me.
And you found out?
- He's either a very honest man, or this town is reaIIy up against it.
WeII, after we ran into bedrock after diggin' for three weeks ...
Look, the boat's here!
Come on, you sour-doughs!
The boat's in! Come on!
He's back, Bronco! - You're pretty sure he's on that boat, aren't you?
If he isn't, I'II find out why not.
- ShaII I get the buggy out? - Yes.
Bronco, never mind that buggy.
For once, Iet him come to me.
IdabeIIe!
IdabeIIe, where are you?
Here I is, Miss Cherry.
Here I is.
What are you doing with that dress?
- Just smoothin' it out a bit.
I heard the boat was in. I figured y'aII wanted to meet it in styIe.
WeII, you can unsmooth it again.
I'm staying right here.
What? Mr GIennister is sure enough on that boat. - Sure enough is.
Go get a bottIe of brandy and a dozen hard-boiIed eggs.
Maybe a dozen bottIes and one egg!
Eggs is scarcer than watermeIons here!
I don't care. Get 'em.
There's two things he goes for in a big way. One of them is eggs.
I reckon the other's ice cream, Miss Cherry?
I sure hope there's some coIoured foIk on that boat.
I's gettin' mighty tired pretendin' Eskimos is from Virginia!
She sure makes this oId saIoon smeII nice!
Cherry!
I knew you couIdn't hoId out.
Makes me some kind of a fooI, don't it? - No.
It makes you the right sort of a gaI.
OnIy it's a shame to turn on aII that good heat for GIennister.
You never wiII Iike him, wiII you?
- No. And you know why.
That Iooks Iike GIennister.
Up you go.
She couId be a reIative.
Yeah ... maybe his Aunt Hetty.
Roy, you oId sinner! - Cherry!
Good to see ya, sport. How are ya?
Better now. For a few minutes
I wasn't so sure.
Oh, this is HeIen Chester.
Cherry MaIotte.
How do you do, Miss MaIotte?
Roy's toId me aII about you.
No need to ask if you enjoyed your trip, Miss Chester.
I know Roy's taIent for entertaining on board. Oon't I?
Easy, Cherry.
- TraveIIing aIone, Miss Chester?
No, I'm with my uncIe, Judge StiIIman.
He's with Roy's partner, Mr Oextry.
''Judge'' StiIIman? - Yep, the Law.
He's circuit court judge.
I'm sure you'II be gIad to know that Iaw and order has come to Nome.
Yes ...
It'II be so much easier on the boys if the girIs have to turn in their guns.
Roy wants to find me a pIace to Iive, if you have no objection.
Objection? - I thought I'd take
Miss Chester to Widow Smith's pIace.
Good idea. I wouIdn't waste any time.
Miss Chester Iooks rather tired.
Yes, I am rather.
ShaII we go, Roy?
- Come on, Cherry.
No, I'II wait.
I want to see Oextry. - AIright.
See ya tonight, sport.
Cherry! How's my IittIe girI?
Right now she has murder in her heart.
You said you'd protect my interests!
Now, wait a minute ... - Not now, we have things to taIk about. Come on.
What others?
- Let's take the good with the bad.
You Iike her a Iot, don't you?
-That's the situation.
Come outta there, CIark!
I know you're in there!
Come out!
Come outta there! You ain't hoppin' no cIaim of mine, CIark!
Grab for your gun! Yank her out!
No you don't!
Are ya hurt bad, FIapjack?
- Where'd he get you, oId-timer?
If you get my cIaim back, Roy, turn her over to Banty and ... kind of bury me at sea. I aIways hankered to be a saiIor.
I hate to disappoint ya, FIapjack.
You won't die of a scratch Iike that.
You mean to say I ain't dyin'?
- I'm afraid not. - Oang nab it!
Just when a feIIa thinks he's got shed of his troubIes ...
That's the nearest I ever come to owning a mine - Shut up!
We gotta get her back first!
Take him over to our tent, Banty.
- Come on, ya disappointed corpse!
Oidn't scare ya, did it?
- Oo these things happen often here?
Once a day at most. - Lucky for Simms you happened aIong. - Yeah ...
You're a stranger here. - Not exactIy.
McNamara. GoId Commissioner.
How are ya?
I'm GIennister. The Midas.
Oh, Miss Chester.
- How do you do, Mr McNamara?
Miss Chester is Judge StiIIman's niece. - GIad to know he's arrived.
You know him?
- By reputation.
WeII, it's a smaII town. We'II bump into each other again. - Sure.
ProbabIy at the Northern.
I'II show you the room. This'II have to do tiII we get something better.
There's the bowI and pitcher.
If there's anything eIse, just ask.
I don't suppose Mr GIennister brung you up from SeattIe for nothing.
If you're thinkin' about marriage,
I'd Iet you have my room for a week.
It's very much more comfortabIe.
It'II be a shame to disappoint a nice oId Iady, won't it?
She'II get over it.
- But wiII I?
Oh, it sounds terribIe. I feeI Iike a designing woman. What'II I do?
The worId is fuII of so much better materiaI. Why me?
Who knows? CouId say the same thing to you. Why Cherry MaIotte?
But it just happens to be that way.
You're not annoyed?
- If I am, it's not hard to take.
If I have to compete with someone, you might Iet me start on even terms.
Is that what you mean?
- PartIy. No more?
Right now wouId be a good time for somebody to knock at that door.
Yes? - One of the boys is coming with your Iuggage.
I didn't come in at the wrong time, did I?
You couIdn't have timed it better.
I'II see you Iater. - Goodbye, Roy.
I guess a Iot of girIs wouId envy you.
Mr GIennister's a reaI man.
I'm beginning to think he is.
Miss Cherry, you sure the kind of medicine good for what aiIs a man!
AII we need then is the man, eh?
If you's referring to me, Miss Cherry, this country Iacks good, soIid coIour!
No chance of choosin', IdabeIIe?
- No pickin' neither.
Oid y'aII say Mr GIennister be comin' right aIong? - I didn't say.
And you haven't heard anyone breaking down doors ...
We've wasted a Iot of time waiting for what we're not gonna get.
Mr GIennister ain't comin' no more?
That's it. No more.
-But, Miss Cherry, we done given that man the best years of our Iife.
We sure have.
What am I gonna do with aII them nice hard-boiIed eggs?
If you want better resuIts than I got try sitting on them.
Sit on 'em? I can't sit on no eggs.
I'II mash 'em aII to pieces.
AIright, Oex ...
Light 'er up and speak your piece.
When you start suckin' on a coId pipe there's somethin' wrong. What is it?
Some sort of spy, ain't ya?
When two men have been snowbound in a Yukon shack aII winter they waIk out come spring either good friends and knowin' each other ...
- Or one of them waIks out aIone.
We've had nine of those winters.
Think nine years gives me Iicense to say what I think? - WeII, shoot.
If I don't Iike it, I can punch you.
If you catch me when I ain't Iooking.
I been thinkin' about Cherry.
Oh. You saw her?
- Yeah, for a coupIe of minutes.
I know you Iike this Chester girI.
- They come from different schooIs.
Yeah, but Cherry'II weight out the better of the two in the Iong run.
A woman don't have to wear a poIish
Iike a new dime just out of the mint.
Them that picks up a IittIe experience goes just as good over the counter.
Oh, a phiIosophizing oId sour-dough, eh?
Look, son.
CIose as we've aIways been, I've never nosed into your reaI private notions.
It's aIright for a man to turn a corner here and there aIong the way, but you and Cherry's my onIy famiIy.
And I feeI father-Iike towards you.
I don't wanna see you spIit up.
- And we're not goin' to, partner.
She's pretty het up. - She'II get over it five minutes after I get there.
WeII, ten anyway.
HeIIo, Mr Sirs.
Writing a poem about me?
Not this time, Cherry. This is about a Iady known as Lou.
Is there a man in her Iife?
- Yes. He's caIIed Oan McGrew.
He's a bad actor. He gets shot.
- Sound exciting.
Ravishing as usuaI, Miss MaIotte.
- StiII out of jaiI, Mr Skinner?
In and out.
How you doing on the door, LyIe?
- Bad.
WiII you rub my head for Iuck?
- Better. I'II give you a shuffIe.
You need a recess, Bronco.
- You're the boss.
Ante, gentIemen!
How's for hornin' in, sport?
Not this round. But there's a new deaI coming up. Make your bets, boys!
CouId a feIIa do himseIf some good in a game Iike this?
The onIy Iuck in poker is the draw.
After that, it's a game of skiII.
Cards, boys?
- Gimme three.
How's a man's chances of improving a pair? - Not so good, they teII me.
Sure ain't my night, Cherry. I'II be cashin' in. - I'II sneak out too.
WeII, if you get enough pIayers for a new game, Cherry, I'm at the bar.
Remember what I said when I Ieft?
''We'II make up for it when I'm back.''
WeII, I'm back.
Yeah, I met the boat, remember?
Listen, Honey, you're not asking for apoIogies and aIibis, are ya?
If I was the kind that bends at the knees, you wouIdn't want me.
But you're not. So I suppose
I can't get aIong without ya.
Sure you can.
Which aIso goes for me.
We couId do with a Iot Iess food, too, but we'd get awfuIIy hungry.
But if you get too much of any one thing, it's good to make a change.
Aw, come on, sport.
Let's get back to normaI.
Why don't we sIip upstairs and taIk things over.
We've got nothing to taIk about.
Miss MaIotte. - Mr McNamara, this is Mr GIennister.
Yes, we've met. Not butting into a private game, am I? - No.
PiIe right in. In fact, you can have my chair. I just cashed out.
No Iuck? - Percentage is with the house. Pretty hard to beat.
But it has been done, hasn't it?
So they teII me. It's a fair gambIe, especiaIIy if there's no Iimit.
There's no Iimit here.
Anything you can win, you can coIIect.
McNamara, we wanna taIk to you.
Some of us ain't satisfied with you.
Circuit court be here in a day or so.
That's the pIace to make compIaints.
We don't care about no courts. There was no troubIe before you came here.
You're not tryin' to tie me in with it, are you? - Suppose we are?
AIright, aIright! Fight's over!
Get back to your tabIes!
Pete! Oanny!
Pick 'em up and throw 'em out.
We'II have no brawIs here.
UnIess they're over me.
Thanks, that's one I owe ya.
- I hope I didn't make a mistake.
Meaning you've got an idea
I might have had it coming?
There's just a chance the whoIe town couId be wrong.
So Iong, sport.
Nice Iad, GIennister. His pants need a bit of pressing, but a nice Iad.
You promised to show me around, remember?
I haven't forgotten.
Some other time.
HoId on there. Stay where you are.
Who are ya and what do ya want?
I'm Jonathon Struve, representative for the GoId Commissioner.
I'm here to serve notice on you.
Oon't get scared, Mr Struve.
This oId eIephant gun of mine just gets speIIs now and then.
But there's one thing she can't stand, and that's IegaI hocus-pocus!
You're gonna regret this!
Mr GaIIoway has fiIed IegaI action, and you're gonna have to answer ...
Behave yourseIf, Betsy!
Oon't mind Betsy, Mr Struve.
That's just her way of sayin' goodbye.
Judge StiIIman wiII hear about this.
He'II know how to handIe things.
Nice work, Oex.
HeIen!
Wanted to see a goId mine, eh?
- What was aII the shooting?
Just Oex's way of informing Iawyers they can't serve papers here.
You mean a court order?
-Yeah, that's what they caII it.
We've got a different name for it.
- My uncIe must have signed it.
Which doesn't make it so funny.
- Why not?
Because it isn't a Iaughing matter.
The country needs Iaw and discipIine.
I've heard you say so yourseIf.
It's impossibIe for anybody to fiIe an honest cIaim to this property.
When Oex and I made this strike there was hardIy anyone here.
WeII, if you can prove that ...
- We can prove it, aIright.
And we're gonna hang on to this.
Nobody's gonna take it away from us.
You both know UncIe Horace.
You know his decision wiII be just.
Sure. Maybe we were a IittIe hasty.
But you didn't come out here to taIk about the Iaw.
Here's my cabin on the hiII.
BeautifuI view from there.
Come on, I'II show you around.
Where is Mr GIennister's pipe and tobacco? - Under the couch. Leave it.
What kinda taIk is that?
It don't do yourseIf no good,
Iettin' yourseIf go. I knows that!
What are you doing? Leave it.
And what's aII this junk?
What's wrong?
Oidn't ya say Mr GIennister's comin'?
Yes, but that's aII. Take that away.
- I ain't gonna do no such thing.
You gotta start out right with a man.
You put that tray down.
I'm gonna put it somewhere where he can't find it.
I couId murder you.
- Hiya, sport.
Oex passed me the good word, and I came right aIong. Brandy and eggs!
You never forget a thing, do ya, baby?
You're fired, IdabeIIe.
- Yes, Ma'am.
WouId you hoId this, darIing?
I didn't send for you for the reason you've got in mind.
I must be in the wrong pIace.
Who Iives here?
Nobody you're on friendIy terms with.
IdabeIIe, take that tray and get out!
- Oh no ya don't! This stays here!
Ooes I or don't I take that tray?
AIright. If there's anything eIse that ya wants, ya caIIs and hopes.
So it's aII over, eh?
No more IittIe champagne suppers, or pIaying on the piano together?
It's a Iong, coId winter, sport.
But we're through, eh?
You seem to be set up for the winter.
I sent for you to taIk about Oextry.
But you won't mind if I sIip in a few words about us?
Oextry's got an idea that
McNamara and StiIIman are crooked, hiding behind a Iaw and order front.
- Oex is fuII of suspicions.
But we can taIk about that Iater.
When you gonna get off that perch?
But Oex couId be right. And if he is, what about your IittIe Miss Chester?
Nice gaI as gaIs go.
And reaIIy refined, isn't she?
A Iady aII over.
She probabIy wouIdn't know how to use a man for a chump, right?. - Worried?
About you?
Why shouId I be?
You're much too smart, aren't you?
New dress?
I hope she doesn't just take your mine off you.
I imagine that dress is supposed to have a chiIIing effect.
WeII, if it is, it isn't working.
You'd Iook good to me in a burIap bag.
Here.
You're so sure of yourseIf, huh?
Everything arranged for your convenience. You just can't Iose.
WeII, see what you can do with this!
Nice aim you got there, baby!
OnIy, I think it's time we understood each other a bit better. Come here!
I'm warning you Roy!
You've got it coming.
I don't know what you have in mind about HeIen Chester and me, but there's nothing to it.
From now on, things are gonna be done my way. So get used to the idea.
And that's my way.
Like it?
I guess that's what's you'd caII puttin' it right on the Iine.
That's good enough for me, sport.
FinaI curtain, eh?
I did that beautifuIIy, didn't I?
Maybe this is a good time for a man to speak his piece.
You know, Cherry, you couId do worse than with a dude Iike me.
You couId peddIe this joint. We couId sIip off to Frisco. I got connections.
Get back to your tabIe, Bronco.
I didn't know he dug himseIf in so deep. CaIIs for tears, eh?
Tears? You know me better than that.
Get beIow.
You're the boss.
What the deviI's the matter with you?
Hey, FIapjack, here they come!
Just what we been waitin' for.
Come on, Banty!
Oextry!
What's wrong? - They're a-comin', Oex.
- A whoIe gang of 'em!
Get your guns, boys, and get ready for action!
Get your gun, Roy.
Where's your gun?
- Have an idea I won't need it.
And you better Iet me do the taIking.
You can be too quick with Betsy.
They ain't gonna move in on my mine!
Stay right where you are, gents!
That's far enough.
I'm here again to serve ya. You gonna accept it, or do we have to use force?
We're not accepting any papers.
-You heard him. We gotcha covered.
We're not Iooking for troubIe.
You'd better taIk to Judge StiIIman.
Ain't nothin' to taIk about. We own a mine. We aim to keep it. - Easy.
You and the judge can come up.
The rest of you stay on your horses.
I'm sorry my first visit has to be an officiaI one.
TaIk right from there, Judge.
Betsy here's gettin' nervous.
I reaIize how you gentIemen feeI, but I wish you'd try to see my situation.
Once the ownership of your mine has been IegaIIy estabIished it can never be disputed again.
There's no better titIe insurance than a sound court decision.
Suppose we give ya this co-operation, what happens then?
UntiI the case is heard a receiver operates the Midas, the takings being heId aside subject to a court order.
That's aII. And when I open court your case wiII heard immediateIy.
What happens to the goId in our safe?
- That stays here on the property.
Under guard and seaIed.
WeII, I've aIways been for Iaw and order, and now that it's in Nome
I don't want to throw it off stride.
Maybe we better faII in Iine, Oex.
You're not gonna Iet 'em move in on us, Roy?
It's onIy tiII Monday. GaIIoway can't prove anything. We'd win in any court.
Your partner's right.
You ought to Iisten to him.
I ain't Iistenin' to nothin'. Get out!
- Steady, Oex! Let's be sensibIe.
The Iaw's workin' in 45 states.
Why not AIaska too?
You're gonna Iet 'em move in on us?
You heard what McNamara said.
It'II onIy be for a few days.
Looks Iike you've made up your mind.
So you want things IegaI, do ya?
AIright. From this day on our partnership is through.
You and I are finished.
Take that into court and IegaIize it.
Wait a minute, Oex!
- What for?
So I can waIk back into town with a weak sister? Not me.
Oon't worry, my boy.
You've done the right thing.
I'II show up in court, Judge.
But before you make any quick decisions, maybe I better teII ya:
Oon't make any mistakes.
What eIse can I do, Cherry? - A man doesn't waIk out on his partner, Oex.
A man who hands his pants over to the enemy ain't no partner of mine!
If you're fond of somebody, you don't do things Iike that. - You did.
Oh, that was something eIse again.
- No, it wasn't. It's the same set-up.
You were aIways crazy about him.
And you gave him the gate.
It's not the same at aII.
I don't Iove him.
You're a Iiar.
I said you're a Iiar, Cherry!
AIright, I'm a Iiar.
Of course ya are.
But I don't know ...
I guess if it come to a reaI showdown,
I couId stand a Iot more from him.
BIast him!
Great IittIe town, Nome.
Something going on aII the time.
You wouIdn't bother us with good news.
Let's hear the worst.
Remember that IittIe safe GIennister used to have at the mine? - Used to?
They ain't moved it, have they?
- I saw 'em Ioading it into the bank.
Stay here, Oex. Where are ya going?
To that bank!
They ain't swipin' no safe of mine!
You'II end up in jaiI.
Suppose we try another angIe.
Ain't no other angIe. Catch as catch can, I say. - CaIm down, Oex.
There's two Iawyers in this town.
One's named Struve.
And we're going to see the other one.
Come on.
Supposing our suspicions are weII-founded?
What IogicaIIy wouId be the intent and purpose of the opposition?
Good evening, Cherry.
How are ya, Oextry?
We've got a probIem, Mr Wheaton.
I know. We've been discussing it.
Come on, Oex. This pIace is haunted. - HoId on, Cherry!
You three have something in common.
It might be time to bury the hatchet.
I know right where to bury it.
This is Cherry's idea, not mine.
I never go to court about nothin'.
They grabbed our mine and our safe.
I say we get 'em back the same way.
Maybe Mr GIennister doesn't know what happened to the safe?
TeII the IoveIy Iady that we're quite aware of what's going on.
Roy has worked out what I consider a very sensibIe pIan.
How does Mr GIennister Iook when he's acting briIIiant?
LittIe bubbIes come out of my mouth, and I smoke. You oughta know that.
Before we start the shooting war we shouId wait for the court case.
If StiIIman doesn't restore the mine, it's up to me to go to SeattIe to a higher court.
- That'II cost money.
Ten thousand more, I'd say.
- We'II manage to raise it.
You don't think they'II
Iet you take money from the safe?
PossibIy. But we can't say yes or no tiII after the hearing in court.
My guess is they'II toss it aII into the bay. And what fIoats, is yours.
Come on, Oex.
WeII, if you ask me, that Judge StiIIman's aIright.
FIapjack got his cIaim back quickIy.
- It sure surprised me.
If we want our seats, we better get in before court takes up again.
So the judge says:
''I'm givin' this mine back to who it beIongs to.'' And that's me!
He's a judge that is a judge!
The oId boy aimed his first guns weII enough, Oex.
When he kicks GaIIoway in the pants,
I'm for him. TiII then, I say nothin'.
At Ieast he taIks Iike a reaI judge.
Roy?
FeeIing better?
- My puIse is back to normaI.
But I'm not out of danger yet.
Looks Iike the number one boy may finish in front.
You wouIdn't bet on that, wouId you?
Now that we're oId friends you may caII me Miss MaIotte.
StiII running coId.
When comes the thaw?
It's more fun this way. Besides, the Iine forms in back of Bronco.
Mr FarreII, Mr McNamara.
Hiya, FarreII.
Something ya got for Christmas?
I aIways carry it. I never know when
I'm gonna run into a piece of cheese.
Bronco was saying he couId pick off the judge easiIy from up here.
I bet him 65 cents he couIdn't.
Want haIf of it?
Sure, it's onIy money.
Oo you mind if Miss MaIotte and I taIk as though you weren't here?
Go right ahead, if you think you can taIk faster than GIennister.
CouId be done ...
We started something in my office and we never finished. ShouIdn't we?
We'II taIk about it after we've heard what the judge has to say.
Stand up! Here comes the judge.
Take off your hats and no smoking!
You can sit down now.
The court wiII come to order.
Next case, Mr Struve.
GaIIoway versus
Oextry and GIennister, your Honour.
Oh, yes.
Because of the crowded caIendar,
I regret the court has been unabIe to give this case due consideration.
AIso, we've been cautioned, privateIy, against making any mistakes.
The case wiII be set forward 90 days.
What? Why, it's a skin game!
The order of decency!
- The oId goat's a thief!
I'm going to pound him on the head!
- You're gonna stay right here!
Turn me Ioose!
I'II tear him Iimb from Iimb!
Quiet down! Quiet, this is a court!
If you are questioning the integrity of this court, you're IiabIe to charges of contempt.
But you promised to decide this case today! - I toId you I'd ''hear'' it.
But in 3 months, they couId take quarter of a miIIion out of the Midas!
If you have anything further to say, say it through your attorney.
Your Honour, I think this extension is unreasonabIe.
I move the court set an earIier date.
- Motion denied.
Sure! Of course it's denied!
You fooIed this young whippersnapper, but you didn't fooI nobody eIse!
It's my duty to warn you that any further act of IawIessness wiII force me to send for troops to maintain order.
Court's adjourned.
I toId you that oId fIea-bitten weaseI was a crook! Now it's my turn!
The bank can't make you a Ioan.
A court order is a court order.
I understand. Thanks.
It Iooks Iike they've anticipated everything. - Yeah.
I'II try 'em once more.
Get a hoId of Oex. I'II meet you at the Northern in haIf an hour.
By this time,
GIennister's been to the bank.
I'd Iike to have seen his face when he found his account frozen.
Credit me with that good idea.
- It's Oextry I want to see squirm.
I can't wait to bend that rifIe he caIIs Betsy over his head!
PIenty of time for that, Struve.
How much wiII we get out of that mine?
- Just what GIennister said.
Quarter of a miIIion.
- Say, that ain't chicken feed!
What's the matter with you, HeIen?
Aren't you gonna ceIebrate?
A IittIe premature, isn't it?
- How's that?
Supposing they send
Mr Wheaton to SeattIe?
We've covered that. A high court appeaI in SeattIe takes money.
There may be other ways of his getting it. That MaIotte woman.
Struve.
Oid you see the ship's captain?
He has his orders.
Wheaton wiII not be aIIowed on board.
That satisfy you?
- No.
I may have more respect for GIennister than you have.
Yes, of course!
He's a big, handsome Iad, isn't he?
I hope you're not going soft.
We're here on business.
Keep that in mind.
- HoId on, AIec!
You haven't faIIen in Iove with him, have you? Have you, HeIen?
WouId there be some Iaw against that?
Judge, I've come to ask you to reIease our funds from the bank.
Such a petition is a matter of court procedure.
Oh, I see.
- You're sending Wheaton to SeattIe?
Seems Iike the thing to do.
Any objections?
No. Good idea!
I hope he doesn't miss the boat.
I don't think he wiII.
You're not Iookin' so good today, honey.
Maybe Nome doesn't agree with you.
Shut that door! Struve, see that Wheaton misses that boat.
Lock him up tiII the boat saiIs.
I don't care how you do it, but I'm hoIding you responsibIe.
How much do you think he heard?
- Who cares? We'II see what happens.
That's enough of that.
What I toId Struve goes for you too.
Just to keep you on the right track.
This deaI goes through as pIanned.
How are ya, Cap?
- HeIIo, Roy. I'm gIad to see you.
GIad to see you too. SaiIing tonight?
- Yes. I wish you couId saiI with me.
There's a friend of mine ...
- Wheaton? - Yeah.
I'm sorry, I can't take him.
I have orders not to.
So I heard. But if, after you saiI, you were to see a man adrift, say five miIes offshore, you'd have to pick him up?
Sure. That'd be the humane thing.
Besides, it's part of maritime Iaw.
That's what I thought. Another drink?
- No, I'II have to keep my eyes peeIed tonight for dereIicts.
- Thanks, Cap.
It's too Iate for IegaI shenanigans.
If we don't get that money, how's Wheaton gonna go to SeattIe?
I'm against whatever you're pIanning.
- So am I.
Any unIawfuI act committed now might upset everything.
Wheaton, you gotta get outta here.
- What happened, Roy?
I'II expIain Iater. Now get over to
FIapjack's mine and wait for us.
And keep under cover!
WeII, oId timer, you were right.
We're gonna do it your way.
WeII, now you're taIking!
Wait! I won't Iet you two dynamite yourseIves into a mess.
I couId get about $4,000 together.
That shouId be enough.
How about it, Roy? - We've got enough of our own. Come on, Oex.
But that was a nice thought, sport.
Thanks for now, I'II be back Iater to put some Iace on it.
What do you think they'II do?
If it was my dough in that bank
I know what I'd do.
Why don't ya use charcoaI?
- Because I Iike cork better.
How are ya, Mr Bones?
- Mr Tambo, I'm about even.
Even?
- Even better than I was before.
Come on, son.
AIright, men. Let's mount up.
You aII know what to do.
Remember, if you shoot, aim Iow.
We don't want to kiII anybody.
Oon't move!
What was that?
- Sounded Iike an expIosion.
I'II go take a Iook.
What's going on here?
What happened? - Bank robbery!
They shot the marshaI.
Give us a hand, boys.
Let's take him inside.
Thanks, boys.
Scatter and keep your mouths cIosed.
Get hoId of Wheaton and teII him what
I toId you. He's gotta get that boat.
What are you pIanning? - I got myseIf a date. Remember Cherry?
Mr Bronco ain't down there!
He ran out after the big shootin'.
Was anybody hurt? - Whoever heard of a shootin' with nobody hurt?
They don't go pointin' a gun unIess they figures to hit someone.
Why you drinkin' that coId coffee?
Let me heat it.
I'II be in my office.
- Why don't you go to bed?
Oh, I couIdn't sIeep.
Huh! CoIoured boy!
Where'd y'aII come from?
How's y'aII, sweet thing? I figured it was time we got acquainted.
Is that so? If you think I'm the kind to mess with anybody comes aIong ...
I say, if you thinks that ...
I'II pour y'aII a cup of coffee.
Wait! Y'aII ain't no coIoured boy!
You's washabIe!
Why, it's Mr GIennister! Why you raisin' up a Iady's hopes Iike that?
Wait tiII Miss Cherry sees you.
- HoId on a minute, IdabeIIe.
Let's get rid of this AIabama tan, and you better wash this shirt.
But you's more handsome than you's ever been before.
If Miss Cherry feeIs the same way,
I'II have to Iive in a smoke-house.
Get me some soap and water.
That's it, Cherry.
I don't know any more than you do.
When I got there it was aII over.
- But Roy and Oex were there?
AII I know is the bank was robbed and the marshaI was kiIIed.
AIright, Bronco.
Oummy up, Cherry. Here's McNamara.
Find Roy and teII him to keep away from the Northern.
Brought some friends with you? Cherry wiII be gIad of the extra business.
I thought she wouId.
You know where GIennister is?
GIennister? How wouId I know that?
Been here aII night?
- WeII, yeah.
I work here.
So that wasn't you who was seen near the bank before the fun started?
Handy IittIe thing, isn't it?
- Yeah.
Good evening, Mr McNamara.
- Oh, Miss MaIotte ...
We had to drop in for a Iook around.
- Look around for what?
GIennister. We thought he might have headed here first.
He's as weIcome as anybody eIse as Iong as he behaves.
I thought we'd Iook here first because of his certain interest here.
We want him for murder.
Oh, our IittIe boy reaIIy got himseIf into troubIe!
Ooesn't seem to bother you much.
- Why shouId it?
What you're thinking, McNamara, is yesterday's news.
If you knew me better, you'd know
I never pIay on the Iosing team.
I'II have to Iook around your rooms upstairs as weII as here.
In the Iine of duty, you know ...
You can't think of a better reason?
You two boys cover the entrances.
You come with me.
Wait here.
WeII, here it is.
Look it over.
Nice pIace for a man to hide.
If there was anything here to interest a fugitive.
Think I couId pass for a fugitive if I acted up a IittIe?
That's nothing to taIk about now, with a gang of men waiting outside.
Suppose I send them away?
-Why don't you?
I shouId've gotten around to this sooner.
That's a bad habit you got, McNamara, jumpin' cIaims.
Apt to get you in a Iotta troubIe.
Got here in a hurry. We weren't expecting you for a whiIe yet.
Bad habit of mine.
Hard-boiIed eggs.
Oon't trip over the sheIIs on your way out.
AIright boys, come in!
Here's your man!
- What is this?
Am I wanted for something?
- Good idea, the bIack-faced stunt.
You might've gotten away with hoIding up a bank, but not kiIIing a marshaI.
If you're trying to pin something on me, you're gonna draw a bIank.
I didn't know you were stiII here.
- You mean he's been here aII evening?
Why not? It's a perfect aIibi.
- Why did ya bring me up here?
You said you wanted to search my room.
- AII you found was my aIibi.
Run aIong and find your evidence.
I thought I had you, GIennister.
But I don't give up so easiIy.
A trip to SeattIe might be good for you before I find the evidence.
Come on, men.
Mr GIennister, I can't get this bIack stuff off y'aII's coIIar.
Oh, I didn't know y'aII had company.
AIright, he's yours.
So Wheaton saiIed, eh?
You're a bIundering idiot, Struve!
A confounded, bIundering idiot!
What more couId I do?
- You couId've seen what'd happen.
You couId've sent a deputy on the boat!
But ya didn't!
Now he'd gone! Now it's aII finished!
You're a confounded, bIundering idiot!
Perhaps we shouId check out now?
- Check out?
Once Wheaton teIIs his story and they investigate your record,
47 marshaIs wiII be here and you'II end up in prison.
Perhaps you're right.
I got some news, HeIen.
That big, handsome Iad of yours
Iooks quite naturaI behind bars.
Judge, quite a mob of miners down at the jaiI.
You may have to send for those soIdiers yet. - I can't do that!
I'm worried about Wheaton escaping.
We shouId Iose no time getting out.
Take it easy, Judge.
PIenty of time to Iine our pokes.
It'II be 3 months before Wheaton gets back.
What's funny about that, baby?
- Nothing.
My, we're a joIIy crew, aren't we?
- CarefuI now, HeIen.
It's so much more fun making money the way we do, instead of sIaving for it Iike miners.
I'm not sure I Iike your attitude.
You've got a distorted viewpoint.
Brought about by what is know as
''the miracIe of Iove''.
TeII us about what a nice community it was before we came and spoiIed it.
Make it sound as sIoppy as you want.
But that's what we are: a cheap Iot of spoiIers!
Now that's enough, HeIen!
No more of this sentimentaI taffy.
But suppose the miners do revoIt?
They bIew out the front of the bank.
They couId do the same to the jaiI and free GIennister before the triaI.
Perhaps you won't have to bring him to triaI.
What do you mean?
That'd be carrying things a bit too far.
We've never had to resort to anything Iike ... Iike murder.
What do you want here?
- Picking a nice time to Ieave town.
Why shouIdn't I go now? I have things
I want to get in SeattIe.
You paid Captain Toombs tripIe fare for passage on a Ieaky oId freighter?
Who toId you that? - Most men who patronize my pIace are my friends.
Captain Toombs is one of them.
Ooes that teII you anything?
I faiI to see why it shouId.
If I wanted him to make room for a friend of mine, he'd do it.
And if I shouId want him to canceI a passage, he'd do that too.
- So what?
What are you running away from?
I'm not running away.
- You're Iying!
You've finished your job. You heIped those cheap crooks put Roy in jaiI.
And now you're going to sneak away.
- It isn't so!
Why shouId I want to hurt him? I ...
- You what?
Why did you come here?
What is it to you if I Ieave?
Isn't it pIain why I want to go?
I can't stay here and see him ...
You're in Iove with him, aren't you?
- No!
WeII, what if I am?
It's you he wants, if that's what you wanted to find out. Now pIease go!
But if you're in Iove with him, why are you skipping out?
A woman doesn't run out on the man she Ioves.
I can't stay and see him ...
I can't stay here, that's aII.
You can't stay and see him what?
They've got a pIan for the triaI!
- There isn't going to be any triaI.
There isn't going to be ...?
They're gonna turn him Ioose,
Iet him escape?
How are they gonna do it?
When the deputy brings him supper, he's gonna Iet him out the back way.
Outside they're gonna shoot him down?
- I fought them, but what couId I do?
Nothing. You're not the type.
AII you can do is run away.
- What can I do to heIp?
Keep your mouth cIosed.
If you do,
I'II see that you get on that boat.
If you don't, you'II stiII Ieave town.
But after I'm through with ya.
Why shouId I worry about what they're going to do to GIennister?
So they'II shoot him in the back. What of it?
You know how I feeI about you.
It's you or nobody, Cherry.
Why shouId I heIp him?
Now Iisten, Bronco.
For you, it's a matter of no one eIse wiII do, isn't it?
That's the way I feeI about him.
No one eIse wiII do.
Understand?
I'II make it five.
- I'II see them. I've got two short.
Three jacks. - That cIeans me.
I better go on with my chores.
A IittIe earIy for their supper.
- I gotta feed 'em sometime.
Excuse me, Iikem see Chinese consuI.
How many times I gotta teII ya?
The next consuI is in SeattIe!
Or maybe you'd Iike to see him?
- You unIock door, I go SeattIe.
Ya taIk Iike a foreigner!
GIennister, pass me that tray.
Take a Iook out in the office and see what Thompson's doing.
He's standing at the door, why?
I made a deaI with Oextry. I bring your supper, and you Iet me have it.
Then you beat it out the back way.
I'II Ieave the door open.
I'm terribIy sorry, Miss MaIotte.
Mr Skinner seems to be carrying an extra Ioad tonight.
What's the troubIe, Cherry?
Has he been bothering the customers?
Can't carry it anymore, Skinner?
Carry it anymore?
How dare you, sir!
I shaII prove the contrary by retiring to my customary retreat, unassisted.
My apoIogies to you, Miss MaIotte.
HeIIo, Skinner.
Good evening, Mr GIennister!
Isn't putting drunks in jaiI a IittIe out of your Iine, Cherry?
I had an idea you might
Iet me see a certain friend of mine.
It'd mean my job if I Iet ya in.
Court's orders.
They certainIy put a Iimit on a man, don't they?
Easy on the punch.
Not this way! It's a trick!
Get out the front!
Oex is outside.
Get into hiding untiI Wheaton's back.
Tonight we're taking back our mine, and then it's every man for himseIf.
Wait up for me, wiII ya, sport?
ApparentIy everything came off on scheduIe. - Yeah, so it seems.
But it's stiII a nasty business.
You better sip a warm Iemonade before you break out in righteousness.
I think I wiII.
Go down to the jaiI and Iet out a howI about negIigence.
Mr McNamara?
You probabIy heard what happened?
- I heard a few shots.
He tried to get away and they shot him. - Shot who? - GIennister.
Bronco and I were taking
Mr Skinner to jaiI.
We were there when he ...
Easy. Perhaps you'd better come in and rest a moment.
No, I'd rather go to my pIace.
WouId you ...?
- Sure.
Miss Cherry, I'm so gIad to see you.
There was a big shootin' at the jaiI.
Yes, we know aII about it.
- You knows aII about it?
Somebody get shot?
- GIennister.
Mr GIennister? Lordy sakes!
Get some brandy for IdabeIIe.
In the kitchen.
Wake up, IdabeIIe.
Oo you hear me?
- Who put out them Iights?
Nothing happened to Mr GIennister.
But I have to keep McNamara here.
I don't want to be aIone with him.
Now cIose your eyes!
Thanks.
Come on, IdabeIIe, have a IittIe sip.
How'd I get back here in Georgia?
Good mornin' foIks!
Now you'II be aIright. - Ain't there something softer to Iay on?
WouId you heIp me put her up here?
She thought the worId of GIennister.
Oh, Mr GIennister!
- Now, now. Have another sip.
I'd feeI better once I gets me on that couch. - Sure you don't Iike it here?
I is positive, sir.
Poor Mr GIennister!
He sure was a IoveIy man.
Hey, KeIIy!
- Yes?
Got enough steam Ieft to go?
- No, but it won't be Iong. Why?
We're taking our mine back.
We're gonna need your train.
But they've buiIt a barricade.
- That's why we need the train.
If you think you'II break through, you're crazy! She'II bIow up!
If it does, we'II buy you a new one.
Get in there and get the steam going.
As soon as the others are here we'II be set to go.
Except this couId aII be a mistake.
Maybe we oughta wait for Wheaton.
Oon't pretend Iike you're on the side of Iaw and order!
Roy! Oex! Here we are!
Set to go, men?
- Yeah! - Wait a minute!
Open that gate!
GIennister broke jaiI. He's gonna try to take the mine back. Bar the gates!
Come on out, men!
Get your rifIes!
Gonna be 30 or 40 armed deputies guarding that mine.
Maybe some of us won't come back.
If anybody's not ready for that, now's the time to speak up.
What we're doing tonight is a warning to any crooks that the pickin's here are tough.
Get aboard.
That goes for you too, Oex.
I'II take the front end.
You heard what KeIIy said.
You're not gonna run that engine.
Can't run itseIf, can it?
How 'bout it, KeIIy?
- AII ready to go.
OnIy Iet me outta here. They're gonna pick you up with a soup spoon.
What are you doing here?
- I aIways wanted to ride up front.
Here they come!
- Scatter, men, and keep Iow!
When they smash the gate,
Iet 'em have it! Shoot 'em! KiII 'em!
Let's crowd 'em!
Hey, Thompson!
You take charge here!
Post guards and don't Iet anybody come within rifIe shot. - I get ya!
WeII, Roy, it Iooks Iike we got the oId ...
Oid you get your mine back?
- Yeah, we got her back, Bronco.
I'd ... Iike to have been there when you tie in with ... McNamara.
WouId it be impoIite to ask for another bottIe? - IdabeIIe!
I is right here. Oon't be scared.
Bring another bottIe of champagne.
- Yes, Ma'am. Be right back!
Good wine and a IoveIy woman.
A made-to-order paradise. To us!
You were right, HeIen.
I wish I'd Iistened to you before.
If you want to catch that boat you better stop taIking.
Where's McNamara? - Over at the Northern, with that MaIotte woman.
But GIennister's taken back the mine!
- Who cares, we're getting outta here.
Not without me! I'II pack my things.
- Hurry. We're not waiting for anyone.
You're not going anywhere!
You got your mine back.
That cIoses the case.
That's enough now, Betsy.
- Now see here ...
Oon't get excited, Judge. You're staying here tiII the reaI Iaw comes.
You and the boys take care of him.
- Come on, Judge.
Where's McNamara, HeIen?
He's at the Northern with ...
He's at the Northern.
Goodbye, Roy!
Come on, sit over here.
- No need to hurry things, is there?
But you've kept the room between us aII evening, and I don't Iike it.
I've had quite a shock tonight.
But that's aII behind us now. The king is dead. Long Iive the king!
I've been waiting for tonight since the first time I saw you.
Nothing's ever so worthwhiIe as it seems beforehand, Mr McNamara.
No? I'II chance that!
You can Iead those sour-doughs around Iike chiIdren, but I'm a man who gets what he wants.
From now on, it's you and me.
No it's not!
You waIked right into the trap.
Trap?
- Yes. Your jaiIbreak didn't pan out.
GIennister's stiII aIive, and by now he has his mine back.
Your visit here has served its purpose, Mr McNamara.
Get out!
Get out?
Get outta the way, Cherry.
I haven't got a gun on me.
No? Then we'II do it the hard way.
Go separate them!
- Let's break it up! No you don't!
Let 'em fight it out.
Let that be a Iesson to ya.
Roy, that's enough. Come on.
Leave something for the Iaw.
Let me go, Oex.
Come on, boys!
Orinks are on us.
Hi, sport.
Sorry I heIped wreck your pIace.
Forget it.
But you said you wouIdn't aIIow any brawIs around here ... unIess they were over you. Remember?
Yes. But I aIso said:
''Anything you can win, you can coIIect.''
Red Valley! All aboard!
It's empty.
Let's go.
I know how you feel, boys.
Being cleaned out is no joke, any way you look at it.
Still, there's a good side to this.
I've learned my lesson and so have you.
We sure have, Clanton.
We're through putting our money in your bank.
Don't forget about them killings, neither.
It's blood money now.
I think you're making a mistake, friends, as far as my bank is concerned.
Look what I had sent from Salt Lake City.
Say, she's built like a battleship, Clanton.
It'd take a battleship to blow her open,
Uncle Willie.
Just came a little too late though, didn't it?
No! Not at all!
I aim to pay back part of what everybody lost out of my own pocket.
Are you fooling?
Why, I've got a funny way of fooling.
Mortgaging every thing I have to raise the money.
I've never heard a banker talk like that before.
Now, don't thank me!
Don't thank me, friends.
I won't be able to pay you back more than fifty cents on the dollar.
But at least you don't lose everything... and I can let you have some cash now to tide you over.
I invite you to step inside and do your banking.
That invitation's good enough for me.
Come on, boys. The line forms on the right.
That's the spirit, Uncle Willie.
What's good enough for you ought to be good enough for everybody in Red Valley.
Pay off everybody 50%.
Need a little money, Mr. McLeod?
I thought I told you there was to be no killing by Jack Lester.
They'll forget it.
Killing's never forgot, and it leads to more killing.
- You made a bad mistake, Clanton.
- Why blame me for the killing?
You were supposed to bring in someone from out of town to do the job.
Sam Glennon in Leadville was to send me a man.
He was to be here days ago, but he didn't turn up.
He'd have done a clean job, from what Sam said.
Maybe so, but we couldn't wait forever.
That's why I called in Jack Lester.
Here's his share.
Finding out he blew an empty safe must be getting him hot under the collar.
You're a fool, Clanton.
People can stand losing money but they hunt down killers.
- I told him not to shoot.
- You didn't tell him loud enough.
- Willie, you heard me say...
- Shut up!
You're a great man in this town now, Clanton.
I guess you're even greater than Santa Claus.
These suckers will be getting back half of what they put in... and naming their children after you.
- How much did we clear?
That's good.
That calls for a drink on the house.
Here's to your health, Mr. Clanton.
That's not a bad amount to get out of a town this size.
It's nothing to what we can get later... if that contract from the army comes through for the horses.
Santa Claus don't drink.
Whoa.
Hey, Jack! You home? Willie McLeod.
Jack Lester!
- I'm here.
- Hello, Jack.
Morning, gents.
Nice to see you all looking so bright and happy.
It's gonna be a lovely day.
Jack, I brought you a present.
$10,000, cash money, and you don't have to thank me.
Looks like you ain't gonna.
You fellas look like you done something you're ashamed of.
I ought to blow your head off.
- That don't seem like friendly talk.
- Not the least bit friendly.
I don't trust you and Clanton any more than you trust me.
Why, Jack, where did you ever get the feeling we didn't trust you?
The other night in the bank.
The minute I found out
I'd blew an empty safe.
- You're a little too smart, Uncle Willie.
- You ain't quite smart enough.
Three men murdered in cold blood.
What's the sense to it?
We was robbing a bank.
I'm a lot older than you, Jack.
In my time I've seen a lot of men with itchy trigger fingers like you.
They're all in Boot Hill with dirt in their face.
Somebody cured them of that itch.
Would you like a couple of holes in that big fat belly of yours?
You're holding up the U.S. Mail and that's a federal offense.
- Hello, Uncle Willie.
- Hello, Sheriff.
You're behind time.
You ought to be in Basin City with the mail by now.
I've been backtracking to find you.
One of my mules got a loose shoe and I was held up.
- What you doing in this neck of the woods?
- Just looking around.
Anything special on your mind?
One of the bank robbers forgot something the other night.
- He did?
- This.
Part of a spur, ain't it?
Hammered silver rowel.
Unusual for this part of the country.
Ever noticed anyone with a pair like them?
No, can't say that I have.
You get around a lot, and I was counting on you to give me a lead.
When a man gets as old as I am, his memory goes first.
Maybe some fellow in silver spurs has passed me... and neither hear nor see him.
If I do hear or see him,
I don't remember it afterwards.
A man can't do much when he gets old except save his money.
Stay out of mischief.
Hey, Uncle Willie.
You forgot to give me back that piece of spur.
Spur? What spur?
That silver-hammered rowel
I picked up in front of the bank.
- You didn't give me no spur.
- Sure I did. Take a look.
Maybe you put it in your pocket.
- Is this it?
- That's it.
That just goes to show you how forgetful a man of my age can get.
If you hadn't remembered giving it to me... you probably never would have got that spur back.
- Don't forget the way home.
- I might any day now.
- So long, Steve.
- So long.
Reach, and don't turn around.
Reach.
I got a lame horse here. We're gonna trade.
- I wouldn't like that.
- That's too bad.
Now don't turn around.
- Anybody here?
- Yes.
- Take care of my horse, ma'am?
- You bet.
Don't usually see a girl running a stable.
Belongs to my father, Will McLeod.
- Did you say McLeod?
- Know him?
Sure. I've heard of him.
Everybody in this part of the country knows him.
- You from around here?
- Nope.
My name's Allison McLeod.
Pleased to meet you.
I didn't quite catch your name.
I didn't give it.
- Nice horse you got here.
- Yeah.
- Bet you had to pay plenty for him.
- Too much.
Found plenty of dust, too, didn't you?
The north trails are full of it.
And there's red mud between here and Basin City, too.
- You've seen a lot of country, haven't you?
- Not as much as you.
Red Valley's kind of new to me.
What's it like?
Sleepy and quiet.
Once in a while we raise a crop of horses.
That isn't all.
- Adios, brother.
- Have you known your horse long?
Time doesn't matter.
We fell in love at first sight.
- Isn't that a dangerous habit?
- Not when you get used to it.
I'll be coming back here tonight to see my horse.
- You be here?
- I'll be waiting.
The Commercial House is a block down.
You'll find that more suitable.
This suits me.
- I'm afraid we have no vacancies.
- Look again.
- I'm very sorry, but...
- Is there anything wrong?
I believe this gentleman has ambitions beyond his means, Countess.
I think we can afford a little charity occasionally.
Follow me.
Thank you.
- Cheyenne!
- Take it easy, Countess. I'm only a visitor.
What are you doing here?
There's $10,000 on your head.
- Are you crazy?
- Nitro come in yet?
Yes, he's been here for days waiting for you.
He said something about a bank job.
- Is it the kind of a job I think it is?
- Yes.
The Clanton Bank?
I think that's the name
Sam Glennon told me.
Hell, that job's already been done.
Now you'd better move before somebody recognizes you.
Somebody already recognized me on the way from Salt Lake City.
I had to travel the long way around.
That's why I'm late.
- I sent Nitro on ahead to wait for me here.
- I thought you were quitting.
So did I, but they won't let me.
I've tried a dozen times.
Every time I got started... somebody remembers my face and wants that $10,000.
Then I get hunted down like a coyote.
What else can I do but keep on?
Come on, sit down.
This will do.
You don't have to sit facing the doors in here.
Sort of a habit with me.
- You're kind of jumpy, aren't you?
- Maybe.
How long has it been since you've seen my folks?
About six months.
Your sister's a very pretty girl.
You'd be proud of her.
- How's my kid brother?
- Good boy. Straight as a string.
You're not heading out that way, are you?
It's Nitro.
Oh, my boudoir!
Cheyenne, welcome to Red Valley.
How do you like the little blowout
I gave you?
You big zombie, you...
I told you to leave that nitroglycerin alone.
I was leaving it alone.
But you see, if it gets a little too warm or a little too cold...
- My knee.
- What's the matter? You hurt?
Yeah, that marble top fell on it.
- Help me.
- Help him? I'll break his other leg.
Don't pick on me. I ain't done nothing.
- Countess. What...
- There's nothing to get excited about.
Just a lamp exploded.
Tim, get inside.
The rest of you, go back to work.
Go on, hurry up. Shut the doors.
Take it easy. Tim, look at his leg, will you?
The bottle that went off was just that big.
Any bigger, and you'd be picking me up with a spoon.
I wish we were!
Funny how a little noise upsets a woman.
They won't believe that exploded lamp story.
The help here get enough pay to believe anything.
I'll send Nitro after you as soon as he can ride.
I hope it's before he blows me all over Utah.
I'm staying.
Cheyenne, this town is right on the railroad.
Somebody's bound to come through and spot you.
- We won't be here for long.
- But why sit around and wait for him?
I was sitting in a jail in Colorado and Nitro waited for me.
When he was through waiting,
I bet there was no jail left.
Just a hole in the ground.
Please go. I'll take good care of him.
Don't you see? I can't leave a man who'd put his neck in a noose to save me.
Sure. I see.
You just want to commit suicide.
- Hello, Steve.
- Hello, Allison.
- You look like you could use another horse.
- I sure could.
- But how did you know?
- You tell me how you lost your horse first.
- Somebody held a gun on me and we traded.
- Know him?
I didn't see him.
He made me keep my back turned.
A horse was brought in today with red mud on him.
The kind you run into on the way to Basin City.
So I came out here expecting to find somebody dead or walking.
You mean somebody brought my horse in the stable?
Who?
I don't remember his name.
Sure you can't remember anything about him, Allison?
Yes, Steve. The way I remember him, he wouldn't come out last in a gun fight.
He seems awfully quick, Steve.
Have you ever seen how fast I can duck?
Don't tell me you're going to break down and worry about me.
Don't you think it's about time?
Evening, Miss McLeod.
Hello. Your horse is back there.
Thanks.
Hello, brother.
Reach.
Reach, and don't turn around.
You're under arrest.
I got him, Steve.
You certainly did.
First time a woman ever finished a fight for me.
Get some water, Allison.
This is a friend of mine.
- A friend?
- Yeah, hurry up.
Quick.
Douse him.
- Hello.
- How do you feel?
I'm all right.
- Surprised to see you.
- Same here.
- That a star on your vest?
- Yeah. I'm Sheriff of Red Valley.
Can I do anything?
- What'd you hit me with?
- A bucket.
- You sorry?
- How was I to know you were friends?
Here, let me wipe your face.
You got a funny way of greeting strangers in this town...
- but you're awful nice to them afterwards.
- You don't seem to be a stranger.
We used to be partners back in Wyoming.
That was my horse you borrowed.
- Your horse?
- Yeah, didn't you know?
No, I was in a hurry... and I left some money in the saddlebag.
Didn't you find it?
No. We'll settle the deal tomorrow.
Come on.
I think you need a drink.
If you'll bring Mr. Smith,
I'll make some coffee.
That is what you said your name was, didn't you?
Yes, Smith. Bill Smith.
Come on, Bill Smith.
Sure is a funny way to treat a horse thief.
- Hello, Dad.
- Hello, Al. Hi, Steve.
Horse kick this fella?
Yeah, on the head.
There ain't a worse place to get kicked.
Man sometimes is silly the rest of his life.
Mr. Smith's all right.
- This is my Dad.
- I'm glad to meet you.
Bill Smith's an old friend of mine.
That so?
I ain't seen you around here before, son.
I'm from Leadville.
I know a fella there name of Sam Glennon.
Know him?
Yeah. Come to think of it, he told me to look you up when I arrived.
Small world, ain't it?
We're going to make Mr. Smith some coffee, Dad.
- I'll fix your supper while I'm at it.
- I'll unhitch my mules and be right in.
Sure is a small world.
They all seem to be enjoying themselves.
Yeah, they've got a right to.
They'll have to pay for it later.
I'm crazy about you, Jack.
Are you crazy about me?
I'd be crazy if I was.
You're lying.
Jack, would you die for me?
You would if you loved me enough.
I'm the kind of a woman who drives men to...
...kind of a woman who wants to drive men to drink.
- A dangerous woman. I want men to die for...
- Shut up.
- Who'd you smile at?
- A horse thief.
- He here?
- Over against the wall.
Seems to be a wallflower tonight.
Some people like to be wallflowers.
It gives them a chance to keep their backs against the wall.
What's he like, Steve?
A little faster with a gun than anybody I ever knew.
- Evening, Mr. Smith.
- Good evening.
They dance well.
She does.
That is, they do.
- I'm surprised to find you still in Red Valley.
- That so?
Ain't much a fellow like you can do here now.
Appears to me as if you'd be getting kind of restless.
I'm satisfied.
If you should need a little traveling money,
I could help you out.
I don't.
You got here too late, Smith.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Bill, I got a girl here who wants to dance with you.
My feelings won't be hurt if you refuse.
I won't refuse.
- Thanks, Steve.
- You're not welcome.
It was nice of Steve to lend me his girl.
I'm not his girl to lend.
It was nice of Steve anyway.
- It's a surprise to see you here tonight.
- Why?
For a lot of reasons.
- Only one reason why I came here tonight.
- What's that?
You.
I don't think I'm going to ask you any more questions.
Something the matter, Countess?
- No, nothing.
- I thought maybe I stepped on your foot.
But you will, probably.
Steve, would you and Uncle Willie mind stepping outside for a minute?
Sure, Hank.
We have some responsible citizens gathered there...
- and we'd like to have you join us.
- What's going on?
You'll find out when you get there.
Come on, Uncle Willie.
Here he comes now, Judge.
Well, boys, what'll it be?
As the legal law in Red Valley,
I represent a body of citizens... that want to do something about those men killed in the bank robbery.
You don't seem much concerned.
Well, we are.
That's right, Steve.
Can't blame them for wanting action.
You can't get action till you know who did it.
When will we know? It looks to me... like you spend most of your time loafing around the country or dancing.
That's no way to catch murderers and bank robbers.
I have to work my own way.
And while you're doing so, what's to prevent it from happening again?
We got a lot of money coming into this town from that horse contract.
If you don't get them robbers, they're apt to be back.
These horses we are selling to the army are about all we have left.
- They won't come a second time.
- That's what you say.
My word's either good or it's not.
To me that don't mean a thing.
I want to see a hanging.
Why, a law officer ought to be out on the trail, not in a dance hall... hopping around like a frightened mountain goat.
Any time enough people want me to resign,
I'll do it.
- That's all I've got to say.
- That's good enough for me.
- For me, too.
- Have a drink.
There's plenty of girls in there.
Have a drink, boys.
Get inside and enjoy yourselves.
- You worried about Steve?
- Yeah. A little.
I think being sheriff means a lot to him.
It means being able to stay here.
Any man would want to do that.
- In kind of a bad spot, ain't you?
- They can't expect miracles.
When I arrest him,
I want to know I've got the right man.
I wish I could help you.
Have you uncovered anything at all?
- I got an idea the man I want is Jack Lester.
- Jack Lester?
- Why, he's only a common rancher.
- Uncommon, Uncle Willie.
He's got a ranch and he doesn't run any livestock on it... and he's got three hired hands to help him do nothing.
- You must be mistaken, Steve.
- I'm getting surer every day.
Do you remember the silver rowel
I showed you?
He used to wear a set of silver spurs and he doesn't wear them anymore.
And I always thought Jack didn't have a dishonest bone in his head.
This is the most terrible thing
I ever heard of, Steve.
Keep this quiet, Uncle Willie.
- Did you hear what he said?
- No.
I got a surprise for you and it won't be pleasant.
I'm waiting.
He's sure Jack Lester is the man he wants.
As soon as he gathers up a couple of loose ends, he's going to have him jailed.
That wouldn't be very pleasant for either one of us.
- Dad.
- Where you bound, Al?
Home, to get something to eat.
If you're hungry, come along.
I'll be along in a little while.
I've got another surprise for you.
See that fellow over there with Allison and Steve?
That's the Countess' cousin, Bill Smith.
What about it?
He's also the man Sam Glennon was sending me from Leadville.
That's enough surprises for one night.
- Hey, where are you going?
- Home.
I've got to chaperon my daughter.
- What's ailing the old buzzard now?
- Plenty.
- Lester, I got a couple of surprises for you.
- Yeah?
Pleasant surprises.
- Well, had enough of my cooking?
- Plenty.
That's a fine thing to say.
- You know what I mean.
- I'll take all I can get. Some other time.
That's better.
Nice place, Red Valley.
What brought you here?
I thought I'd like to see the Countess.
What's keeping you, besides Allison?
Nitro's up at the Countess' with a bad foot.
You and Nitro Rankin?
- That's a funny combination.
- Nitro did me a favor once.
Do you know anything about the bank robbery we had here?
I know one thing, Steve,
I had nothing to do with that robbery.
Do you believe me, Steve?
What you say has always been good enough for me.
Thanks.
Why don't you stay here in Red Valley?
I'm wanted, Steve.
You can get $10,000 for me.
I don't want you at any price.
- Like some more coffee?
- Not for me, Allison. I gotta be going.
So do I.
- You're welcome here any time, Bill.
- Thanks.
- What about me?
- You're part of the family.
That's the trouble. Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Miss Allison.
- Goodnight.
Goodnight, Uncle Willie.
- Through with your courting, boys?
- For tonight, yeah.
Yeah, having a daughter's a real trial.
Man with a son can get all the sleep he needs.
But with a daughter you can't close your eyes until everybody's gone home.
Thanks.
How do you like him, Al?
The way you do a book when you don't know how the story turns out.
Books have happy endings.
This story could have a happy ending.
Does it matter what he's been?
All right, come on!
- Come on.
- Get it on.
Come on, boy.
Oh, for Pete's sake.
- Enjoying yourself?
- Kind of.
I got a job here breaking wild horses.
Horses the ranchers are selling to the Army.
A job? Are you crazy?
I must be, with a job like this.
Come on home with me. You want a job,
I'll give you one dealing faro at the hotel.
I like it here.
I get $3 for every horse I break.
I'll give you $50 for every sucker you break.
You'll get killed here, one way or another.
- No, thanks.
- Why?
I'm kind of changing my ways.
Aren't you kind of forgetting who you are?
I'm trying my best to, Countess.
All right,
I'll be by later and pick up the body.
Easy, boy.
You'll get used to a load on your back.
Everybody does.
He won't mind that in a little while.
Howdy. That's just what I've been telling him.
Sometimes I feel sorry for them, though.
It's hard to lose that kind of freedom.
That depends on what you trade it for.
Are you working here now?
- It doesn't seem like your kind of job.
- Well, it isn't.
Then why are you doing it?
I answered that question the other evening, or do you want me to tell you again?
I said I wasn't going to ask you any more questions, didn't I?
Okay. Come on.
Listen to me.
Smith came to town to rob the bank, didn't he?
Suppose you said so in a crowded place where everybody...
Where everybody could hear you?
He's a stranger.
He's got no good reason for being in town.
He might find that hard to explain.
And Red Valley would sooner believe you than him.
Especially since you have me backing you up.
- That's a good idea, Clanton.
- Yes, but there's one flaw.
Smith might give some good answers.
He'll never get the chance to answer.
Easy.
Maybe I ought to just pour this liniment on you and let it soak in.
You only been working one day and you're as banged up as a Republican in Texas.
- What will you be in a month?
- I ain't banged up.
Now, take me, I'm fine.
Leg don't hardly hurt at all no more.
Hey, not so hard.
All right, that's enough.
You ought to knock before you come in here, Countess.
Suppose I was taking a bath or something?
If I ever hear of you taking a bath,
I'll start knocking.
- How do you feel, Cheyenne?
- Pretty good.
- Going out again tonight?
- Just down to see my horse.
Does your horse like you to wear a tie?
He hasn't said.
A fella can't be too good to dumb animals.
Aren't you forgetting something?
I'm through carrying it.
It's getting too heavy for me.
You know, I heard a song one night about the other side of the mountain.
That's where I've been for a long time, on the other side.
And I want to come back.
- But can you?
- I can try.
They say a man is through when he develops one weakness, Cheyenne.
You're getting weak.
You'll put your neck in a rope.
I can't help it.
Please get away from here as soon as you can.
Red Valley's no place for you to start over again. Get across the border.
I'm Bill Smith now,
I'm not Cheyenne anymore, and I like it here.
You're not Bill Smith, you're Cheyenne Rogers, you always will be.
You're in too deep to ever get out.
I've been on the other side of that mountain for a long time.
But I know I never can come back.
Maybe that's the difference between us.
No use getting serious, Countess.
Falling in love with him is just building up for a quick goodbye.
He's gotta keep on traveling.
Nitro, did you ever want to live your life over again?
Me? I couldn't stand the excitement twice in a row.
Cheyenne and I were raised together in Wyoming.
We went to the same school, the same church.
We were like brother and sister.
I was gonna be a school teacher.
He was going to raise the best horses in Wyoming.
You know, I always figured he didn't get any pleasure out of gun fighting.
Then came the gold strike.
Claim-jumpers moved in on my father's land, killed him.
I called on Cheyenne for help.
He came, there was a fight.
Some of the men were killed.
From then on, Cheyenne's been a hunted man, and I'm responsible.
Don't you feel bad.
A fellow with his talent for throwing a gun shouldn't waste it.
I ought to hit you, but I'm afraid you'll explode.
- Bill, heading for the barn?
- Hello.
Allison ain't there right now.
I was just going down to look at my horse.
Steve was in to see his horse little while ago.
Seems like there ain't nothing more Ionesome than a Ionesome horse.
Except maybe a Ionesome man.
A man don't need to be if the saloon's open.
I just gave up chewing tobacco for rum.
Have a drink with me.
- No, thanks.
- Come on, one little drink won't hurt you.
All right.
Drink hearty, gents. Tonight's my last night.
- Selling out?
- Lock, stock, barrel and goodwill.
I've been building here for 10 years and keeping dry while I did.
Tomorrow I take my first drink and start back for Connecticut.
Red Valley's gonna miss you, Dan.
I ain't gonna miss Red Valley.
No, sir, a man's got a big responsibility, running a place like this.
Keeping friendship and goodwill, protecting his glassware.
I'm tired of it.
- Good luck to you, Dan.
- Thanks.
Here's to green pastures and no fences.
Hello, Jack. What'll you have?
Nothing but some answers to a few questions, and from you, stranger.
- I don't answer questions.
- Now, Jack...
Shut up.
You're gonna answer mine.
Now, gents, this is a place for drinking, not talking.
Name your poison or I'll have to ask you to leave.
First I wanna know your name.
And speak up real loud so everybody can hear you.
- Bill Smith.
- Louder.
- Bill Smith.
- Smith, huh?
Now, there's an unusual name.
Where are you from?
All over.
- What do you do for a living?
- Break horses.
You've been doing that one day. What else?
- None of your business.
- I'm making it my business.
You know what I think it is?
It's robbing banks.
I'm not carrying a gun.
Gents, please be friends.
It's a glass house here we're all living in.
Free drinks on the house.
Nothing like friendship and goodwill.
No gun?
That's mighty careless for an outlaw.
I say you robbed the Clanton Bank.
You're just waiting till we get more money so you can rob it again.
Gents, please! Cut it out!
Gentlemen, please!
Whose bet?
- I'm at $10.
- I raise.
- Aces up.
- No good. Three 10s.
- All right, boys. He didn't fill his flush.
- Two pair.
Gentlemen, I'll have to ask you to leave.
- Raise $20.
- I call.
- What you got?
- Three queens.
The next time I meet you, Smith,
I'm gonna make sure that I...
Let's get along.
- What's on your mind?
- Nothing.
Shame you missed the fight, Steve.
Guess we didn't do the saloon much good.
Look, I thought you wanted to talk to me.
Not talk, Cheyenne, just say goodbye.
- Is that an order, Sheriff?
- Depends on how you take it.
I didn't even have a gun with me tonight.
Next time you meet Lester, you'll have to kill him.
That's what I was thinking.
Then his three friends, then Red Valley will have a famous gunfighter.
I thought you could stop here, Cheyenne... but you can't any more than you could stop in Wyoming or Colorado.
Maybe you never can stop.
Anyway, I can't let you kill Lester.
I'm saving him.
So if you stay here in Red Valley... there'll have to be a showdown between you and me.
- I figure we might as well have it now.
- Suit yourself, Steve.
I can't help myself.
I can't even help Allison unless I get you out of here... before she breaks her heart wishing for something that's not in the cards.
It's tough to leave here now.
I know.
But you couldn't have a better reason than her.
Or a better reason for staying.
If you're not gone by morning, Cheyenne,
I'll be coming for you.
Nitro's getting the horses.
See for yourselves, friends.
Good American money, and better than coin in every way.
My, what'll they think of next?
Those bills are light, handy, don't take up much space.
You can carry a large amount without attracting attention.
- Is that so?
- You'll see the day come... when a man wouldn't start out anywhere without a supply of paper money.
- You don't say?
- Yes, sir.
The only thing you can't do with it is fill your teeth.
- I guess you're kinda glad to get rid of us?
- I sure am.
That's the way I like to go.
Nobody misses me.
Keep on going this time, will you?
We won't be running into each other anymore.
Let's not talk about it.
- Hey, what's the hurry?
- Hurry? Did it look like I was hurrying?
- So long.
- Come on, Cheyenne.
Don't worry about me, Countess.
I'll be all right.
You'll never be all right, you old half-baked dynamite cooker.
Come on, let's go.
Why, what's the hurry?
We're not in any hurry.
- Yes, we are. I just robbed the bank.
- What?
Ride! Come on.
That does it.
Ben, Charley, Marty, Joe, Jim, follow me.
The rest of you cover this end and get them in case they head back.
It's all over. Come on out with your hands up and take your medicine.
- Let's shoot our way out of here.
- But we ain't got a chance.
- They're ten-to-one against us.
- Once in jail is enough for me. Come on.
You're too young to die, and so am I.
Well, gents, there's 12 of you here and it takes 12 to make a jury.
Now we got two men here to hang, but we're going to do it by the law.
- Hank, you be foreman.
- All right, Judge.
Lift your right hand.
Do you solemnly swear to put the law on them bank robbers, so help you?
- I do.
- That's the stuff, Hank. Lower your hand.
We got to have a little evidence, but very little.
Wait a minute.
- Holding up a bank's not a hanging offense.
- It ain't?
- It is if somebody's killed.
- They didn't fire a shot.
They fired plenty the other night.
Order in the court!
Jack, you mean to say that them fellows did all the bank robberies?
I saw them kill three men the night of the first robbery.
That's a lie.
Steady now, don't you go shooting any witnesses, Sheriff.
We're gonna have law, all law and nothing but the law in this court.
- Sit down, both of you.
- Listen to me, Judge.
Lester is swearing away the lives of a couple of men... because he got licked in a saloon fight.
I know Bill Smith here.
I've lived, eaten and fought with him.
We've dodged bullets together.
Some of them came from the law, the kind of law you got around here.
Sit down! That ain't the kind of testimony for a peace officer to be giving.
Your Honor, you got an eye in your head... to see what a fine upstanding young man
Mr. Smith is.
Willie, no one asking you questions.
Besides you don't know about him anyway.
Sit down, Willie!
I aim to give Red Valley a couple of hangings... that they'll be proud of in days to come.
Any man that comes between me and my doing it... will get knocked higher than Gilroy's kite with no due process of law at all.
Now let me hear the skunk that's changed his mind after we been to all this trouble.
Let me hear him.
Only about 12 hours now till you boys get some exercise.
Walking on air.
It ought to do you a lot of good after all this sitting around.
Fellow runs into a mighty poor grade of stock in a place like this.
Oh, hello, Smith.
Take a good look, my friend.
Pretty nice, ain't it?
It looks mighty trim.
You couldn't get a better stepping-off place.
Wait, I want to show you something.
Mighty slick, ain't it?
You're going out in style, Smith.
Makes me kinda glad I come here.
- Afternoon, Nitro.
- Hi, Judge.
Now, according to due process of law... you condemned men can make any last request you want.
Now, if you got one, speak up.
I got one, Judge. Keep your trap shut.
Keep your trap shut. That's a hot one.
How's he taking it?
Way a man like he is would.
Sits there and talks to Nitro.
Smokes too much and waits for somebody to make a mistake.
- The way you would if you were in his place.
- There's nothing else to do.
He didn't kill those men, did he?
He didn't even rob the bank.
Nitro did that on his own.
I'm glad.
What can I do?
They want a hanging in Red Valley and a man has sworn their lives away.
I'm Sheriff, but I can't make my own law for friends.
Bill's what Dad calls from the other side of the mountain, and he can't come back.
He tried, Steve.
He's hanging for something he didn't do.
I suppose a man has to die the way he lives.
Do you really believe that, Allison?
I'm trying to.
Here's lunch for the prisoners.
Let them out.
- Steve...
- I'll be responsible.
- Hi, Bill.
- Hello, Steve.
Same old stew.
I reckon a little pepper will liven it up some.
I won't be needing my hat anymore, Steve.
I'd kinda like for you to have it.
Thanks, but I can't take it, Bill.
Why not? It's a good hat.
I paid $40 for it in Santa Fe.
- Well, for old times' sake.
- Sure.
Why don't you put it on?
Let's see how you look in it.
How's this, Bill?
Why, the brim tips a little bit to the left, kinda.
You're coming along with us, Steve, just in case.
But you make one false move and I'm gonna blast you.
I believe you would, at that, Cheyenne.
Back way.
Perfect.
Hi, Steve. Afternoon, boys.
Hi, Judge.
What is the meaning of this?
It means you can't keep your trap shut.
- This will be far enough for you, Steve.
- All right. Whoa, fellow.
Sorry it was your jail we had to break out of.
I didn't fall for that hat trick, Cheyenne.
We used it once in Deadwood. Remember?
Yeah, but do you think they'll fall for that story back at Red Valley?
Why not?
I was careless, and I was surprised.
- There's been jailbreaks before.
- Sure there has, Sheriff.
- You ain't a bad fella as sheriffs go.
- Thanks.
This trail leads south.
Follow it to the end and when you get there, keep going.
Good luck.
Adios, Steve.
You know, there's something funny about this.
About what?
You may think I'm loco, but I got a sneaking hunch the sheriff let us go.
Maybe you're right.
What are you stalling here for?
We was heading south.
- I'm going back into town tonight.
- Back into town? What for?
I'm going to see Sundown.
You pick up the grub and meet me here when you got it.
- Let me know when you're here.
- We'll holler for you.
Sundown.
Looks like you're a shade slower on the draw than you used to be, Cheyenne.
Cheyenne?
- Ain't I gonna get a chance?
- You had a chance.
- You can't shoot a man down like a dog.
- This is the other way around.
You sat here and let me walk into a trap.
They surprised me as much as they did you.
Ain't you stringing this out too long?
Why don't you kill him and let's be on our way?
Cheyenne, you ain't serious, are you?
You're only joking.
Killing me don't make sense.
It never does, to the fellow that's getting killed.
Let me talk.
Give me a minute before you pull that trigger!
This is murder!
You tried to murder us.
A rope's a slow way to go.
I'll make it quick for you.
I've heard about you, Cheyenne.
You don't shoot people in cold blood.
That ain't what you said at the trial.
I'm sorry about what I said at the trial.
I didn't mean it.
- You're wasting your breath, Lester.
- No, Cheyenne, please wait!
I'll cut you in on the whole setup.
Keep talking.
Clanton's in on this.
I never thought of making a partner out of a banker.
All you got to do is say the word and you're in.
I knew you'd talk, Lester, standing at the other end of a gun.
Now you're going down the street with me and make another speech.
Hey, Jack! Are you ready?
They're inside! Let them have it!
Allison.
Bill.
It's you! Was it you?
What are you doing here?
I came back here to make Lester admit he lied about those killings... in front of you.
You didn't have to do that.
I couldn't go away having you think
I was a killer.
I never thought that.
Say that again.
I never thought that. I couldn't think it.
That's what I wanted.
I'd almost given up caring whether anybody believed in me or not...
- until I met you.
- I believe in you.
I'll always believe in you, Bill.
I can't help myself.
Please go, Bill.
I want you to take a message to Steve for me. It's important.
Tell him that Jack Lester...
A fellow with a daughter can't leave home for a minute, can he?
You'd better get going, quick.
You think so?
You ain't got any friends but us left in Red Valley.
They put Steve in jail for letting you escape.
Jail?
It's true.
Give Dad the message you had for Steve.
I haven't got any message for Steve now.
But I do have one for that banker Clanton.
You tell him to get Steve out of jail by tomorrow, or I'm coming back.
Come on, Cheyenne, let's go.
Go, Bill.
We've got to get Steve out of jail.
If we don't, Bill will come back.
I can't help Steve, Allison.
I just can't.
I'm out. Four blue chips.
I'm out, boys.
- This is a funny place for you to be.
- I know it.
The respectable women in Red Valley only come here when they want a favor.
Like finding out how much their husbands are losing at gambling.
- Was he here?
- Who?
Bill, before he got in that mess with Lester.
You can call him by his right name, it doesn't matter now.
Cheyenne Rogers... and you can get $10,000 for him, dead or alive.
I want him alive and far away from here.
Why did you keep him hanging on?
- I didn't.
- You're the reason he stayed.
You were the reason he tried to change.
And you'll be the reason he'll finally put his head in a rope.
He mustn't come back again.
If he's found out Steve's in jail, nothing can stop him.
One thing could. If Steve got out.
Not a chance.
Clanton's a big man in this town... and you have a lot of influence with him.
If he said to release Steve, they'd let him go.
It's too late.
They want Cheyenne so much, they'll hold Steve just to get him back here.
You can try, can't you?
You're a pretty cool customer.
You'll save him now, if you can... but you wouldn't save him when you should have.
You could have sent him on his way with a few words.
I couldn't say those few words and tell the truth.
Let him come and be strung up, if he's foolish enough...
I don't care what happens to me, you, Steve or anybody else... but I want him alive! Do you understand?
Sure, I understand.
You'll have your heart busted up in so many pieces... you'll have to carry it around in a sack.
Goodnight, Miss.
Good afternoon, my friend.
What can I do for you?
Nothing. What are you doing for yourself, Clanton?
Everybody who can carry a six-shooter will be out tonight.
He'll have plenty against him if he comes.
Instead of waiting for him, we should be celebrating the arrival... of the last of them Army horses tonight to fill our bank with money.
You, Jack Lester, had to talk.
What would you do, if your head was gonna be blowed off?
I'd keep my mouth shut.
Then keep it shut. You're in the same fix.
Stop arguing, will you?
We can't afford to fight among ourselves.
- Maybe he won't come.
- Shut up.
Countess, this is an unexpected pleasure.
Stanley, I hate to bother you but I just had to see you.
- Any time, dear lady.
- Hello, Uncle Willie.
- Afternoon, Countess.
- Take the seat of honor, my dear.
Now, what can I do for you?
Maybe she wants to find out her cousin's real name.
You know, it's too bad he didn't kill you when he had a chance.
He'll get another one.
Mr. Lester, I'll thank you to keep a civil tongue in your head.
Your wish is my command.
Stanley, I want you to release Steve for me.
- Steve?
- Yes.
What on earth for?
Cheyenne won't come here if he's free.
I'll never ask you to do another favor for me.
Countess, I can't do that.
Please, Stanley, for me.
Anything, but not that.
A man in my position can't ally himself with criminals.
- Will you forgive me?
- Certainly.
Certainly, I'll forgive you... you big, loud-mouthed, stupid old windbag!
Maybe we ought to do what the Countess says.
Sure, let Steve out to find Cheyenne.
Then he'd get a posse together in Basin City and come back for us.
I've got a bump on my head.
Make up your mind where you stand.
I'm in the middle.
You better be out on the street tonight, on our side.
All right.
- Got a gun?
- Yeah.
I thought I had.
That's funny. I took it this morning.
I didn't think you'd misplace a thing that big.
Here it is.
- Keep it ready.
- I'll be ready.
There go the horses for the Army into town.
Yup. The town will be full of money.
Until Clanton and Lester blow that safe again.
We're going back into town. Come on.
Hey, you're crazy. We're traveling south.
Steve's got to get out of that jail.
Forget it. He's safe there.
- Why break our necks?
- He broke his neck for us.
Well, looks like we're going back.
- We sure are.
- Sure.
We just walk in, and they're waiting for us with shotguns and ropes.
You see those horses down there?
That's the answer.
We're going to go in with them.
Yeah, but how?
We'll join the herd at dusk.
We'll pretend to help the wranglers and go in with the horses.
Nobody will see us. No trouble at all.
No, no trouble at all.
Come on.
What are you doing?
Nothing much.
- How was the trip with the mail?
- No different than usual.
- Hungry?
- No.
The whole country's talking about this fellow, Smith.
- Has anyone seen him?
- I guess not.
His real name's Cheyenne Rogers.
Do you hear that?
Real bang-up outlaw, they say.
Dangerous afoot, on a horse, or laying on his back.
Wouldn't think so quiet-spoken a fellow as him is bad, would you?
- They say he's a good bad man.
- There ain't no such thing.
A bad man's bad for himself and everybody else.
Hope I never lose you, Al.
I might get some real bad habits.
What do you say we leave town for a while?
Let's catch a train this afternoon to San Francisco.
We'll stay there until we can't stand the sight of fog or salt water.
But what about the stable?
And you have the mail...
They don't matter, we'll have ourselves a time.
Restaurants, theatres and parties for you.
Lots of nice clothes and jewels in San Francisco... and I'll buy myself a plug hat and a Prince Albert coat... so you won't be ashamed of me.
How does that sound?
- I can't go.
- Why?
Don't ask me why. I just can't go.
I don't have to ask.
I guess you dropped this out of your stuff when you was carrying it out.
Maybe you'd better put it back.
Are you mad at me?
No more than when you caught the measles and I got them trying to nurse you.
Nobody ever asked for the measles, they just come.
Suppose he don't show up?
I hope he doesn't, but if he does I'll be with him.
- I got a couple more deliveries to make.
- Dad...
How do you feel?
Like my father felt before me.
Ain't much difference between fathers, honey.
Cheyenne, quit your fooling.
The whole town's gunning for us.
We can't make it.
You got any nitroglycerin with you?
- Be Ionesome without it.
- All right, now listen.
We're joining the herd here.
I'll get in front, you get behind.
When I give you the signal, set off a charge that will stampede them.
- Yeah, then what?
- I'll be leading them, they'll follow me.
If your horse falls in the front of them wild critters... it'll be your last ride.
I'll run them into town and I'll lose myself in the herd.
You're still crazy.
They'll be waiting in the street, but not for long.
The stampede will soon clear it.
Yeah? What happens next?
I get to the jail and Steve gets out.
Then what?
I don't want to tell you the end.
You might lose interest.
- Hi, Jerry.
- Hi, Smith.
I thought you were breaking horses at the corral.
I decided to take a little vacation.
You need some help bringing them in?
Sure thing. The last couple of miles are always the hardest.
It'll go fast for you.
Do you think they'll come?
If they do, they'll think they've run right into the middle of Custer's last stand.
What are you carrying the hardware for?
They'd have crossed the border by now.
You better stay inside.
There's liable to be some lead flying tonight.
Go on, all right. Don't worry.
- Who's there?
- It's Amos. Open the door.
Leave the door unlocked.
If he comes in, we'll make it easy for him to get a belly full of lead.
Blackie, you watch the back door.
Stampede!
Bill!
Here's a gun, Steve.
I'm coming in the back way.
Get to that back door.
Drop that shotgun, Blackie.
Don't believe me?
Let's get out of here.
Open that door, I'll blast you.
Come in, Cheyenne.
All right, open it.
Where do we go from here?
After Clanton. You want him and Lester.
Clanton? You sure?
Yeah, Lester told me last night.
Think what we can do with $80,000.
I'm beginning to understand. I wouldn't walk around the corner with you... you murdering crook.
I didn't think you were such a sentimental fool, Countess... like the rest of the yokels in this town.
- You can't get away with this.
- Can't I?
I've heard about rats deserting sinking ships... but this is the first time I ever seen one.
Get out of my way, Uncle Willie.
You got me scared, but not for $80,000.
Get out of my way.
Let go.
- Quit.
- Just let loose of my arm. Let go!
- Let go, I tell you.
- No, I won't.
No, please, Mr. Lester. Don't come in!
- Get out of the way. Get back there.
- Put up your guns.
Put up your guns. No shooting.
Please, Mr. Lester, it's all new glassware.
- Shut up.
- Drinks on the house.
There she goes again.
Duck! Get out of the way, will you?
Hit the floor!
Watch out, Cheyenne.
Friendship.
There they are!
We'll have a couple of legal hangings right here and now.
- Get them, boys!
- Wait a minute.
Nobody's going to be hanged.
The men that should've been are beyond that now.
- What do you mean by that?
- Don't listen to him.
Get them while you got a chance.
Take it easy.
Especially you, Judge.
That's better.
Cheyenne's got a little story he's gonna tell, and I want you to listen real careful.
Boys, I just caught Stanley Clanton lighting out of town with the money from the bank.
I had to shoot him, and before he died, he confessed.
He was in cahoots with Jack Lester and robbing his own bank.
Here's all your money.
Do you, Bill Smith... take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife?
I do.
And do you, Allison McLeod... take this man to be your lawful wedded husband?
I do.
I pronounce you man and wife.
What God has joined together let no man put asunder.
Well, go ahead and kiss her.
Give her a little smack.
Dad.
- Mrs. Smith, best of luck to you.
- Thank you.
Well, wasn't it worth it, Willie?
Sure. I'm glad I confessed.
How was Bill gonna get a fresh start, or Allison be made happy... if I didn't clear the whole thing up?
And you ain't gonna be ashamed of that honesty, Willie.
No, sir. Why, you're gonna get a quick, fair, legal trial... and not a day more than 20 years.
That's mighty fine of you, Judge.
What?

- Unless what?
George, you recollect that fork in the road
500 miles back, we turned right?
I just remembered we should have turned left
It don't surprise me none
A cowhand that goes in for breaking horses, he's been hit in the seat of the pants so many times, he ain't got any brains any more, just oatmeal in his head
# I wished I was a big, red apple
# Hanging on a tree
# And every pretty girl that come along
# Would take a bite out of me
# Round and round, Old Joe Clarke
# Round and round we're goin'
# Round and round, Old Joe Clarke
# Bye-bye, Lucy Long #
- Howdy, friend
- Howdy
- Where are we, old-timer?
- This here's Payneville
Painful? What's painful?
- This here is
- You mean generally or is this personal?
It's a bad sign when the first fella you meet in a town is some kind of hobgoblin
Don't go far I don't aim to be drinking for more than five or six hours
- Is that him?
- Yes, I think so
(softly) # Round and round, Old Joe Clarke
# Round and round we're goin'
# Round and round, Old Joe Clarke
# Bye-bye, Lucy Long #
I guess she's got as much right to get thirsty as a man
(hums)
- Look She's coming out
- Just look at that walk
Very nice
Very nice
- No, Ira Don't
- Let go of me
No, look!
I didn't mean nothin'
I didn't know
All right From now on, don't go making remarks about other men's girls
Yes, sir
No, no, sir No
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing, señor
You want something maybe, please?
Give me some of them
¿Tomates?
- Open 'em I'll eat 'em here
- Sí, señor
Again
Don't try to draw with him
If you do, you're dead
- Did he see me?
- No
I thought he did
He'll cross back over to get his horse
We pushed a thousand head of cattle out there, me and my partner, him and me
What's more, you fuzzy-faced apes, my name ain't Roscoe and I ain't nobody's uncle
The next one that calls me so will get down on the floor
Don't look for me back, either
I will invest my money where at least one man ain't a lunatic
- Drunk already?
- Let's get outta this place
It's a spook town
The more I see, the more I don't like it
- They do something?
- No, outside of calling me their uncle
It's their attitude They're disrespectful
George, you take gettin' used to
You don't make the right impression
- You ought to know that by now
- Ought I?
You walk in someplace where nobody don't know you, you already got that dumb look
You ask some fool question any papoose could answer, like, "Where am I?"
You ain't immediately nominated for governor
You gotta walk in kinda unsmiling
Unsmiling?
Look and act like you're somebody, like you can take care of yourself no matter what happens
- Pretty soon you are somebody
- That what you done?
I ain't said more than two words in this town and already I got a certain standing
Unsmiling, eh?
I can walk in any place and clear my own place at the bar until they even before they know me
- All right Come with me
- Huh?
Come with me
Mr Unsmiling Jones
Thought you said you weren't coming back
(laughter)
(men fall silent)
- Your pleasure, gentlemen?
- Some liquor
Yes, sir
Stop goggling You're with me
- Mud in your eye
- Thank you, sir Thank you very much
- Good stuff
- Yeah
- I make it myself
- How much?
On the house, any time
Much obliged
You see?
It's spooked
The whole dad-blamed town is spooked
We gotta get outta this place quick
Why, it's all very simple, George
Simple? What would you have done if somebody had drawn on you?
What would anyone draw on me for?
Because you was asking for it The way you walked in, your face all scrounged up
It was just asking somebody to slap leather with you
Well
Look, Melody, you couldn't hit the hind end of your horse with a handful of bug shot
- Right in front
- He'll move
You ain't a gun fighter
You ain't even a good shot
You're just a no-good bronc stomper that's been hit in the seat of the pants eoeok
He's looking at something else
Darlin'!
Monte!
(whihspers) Don't move There's a gun on you
- Come with me Keep close
- Listen, lady
Do as I tell you and I'll get you out of this Smile Smile
That's better
Stay right here and I'll get your horses
- (George) Who is it?
- I never seen her before
In Cherryenne when you was kicked in the head and missing four days, you sure you didn't marry somebody?
I wasn't that far out of my head
Whoa
- Keep close to the front wheel
- But
- You looking to get shot?
- No
Then do what I say
When you start moving, move
Now can you tell us what happened?
- What's them initials stand for?
- That's for my name, Melody Jones
For Monte Jarrad too
You don't look much like him, really
Excepting you're built something like him
- Tall and spindly
- They took me for somebody else?
That's why I did what I did, so's you wouldn't get killed by mistake
Oh
- Then it wasn't me they were scared of?
- They thought you was Monte Jarrad
You say somebody is fixing to kill this here Monte Jarrad?
- Nobody but the sheriff and his posse
- Any particular reason outside of prejudice?
Well, there's always the reward, of course
1000 dollars, dead or alive
Mr Unsmiling Jones, a man with a certain standing in the community
(dog barking)
Whoa
- Is this Monte?
- No, they just took him for Monte
Of course it's Monte
Hi, Monte Heard a lot about you
Don't pay no attention to Pop
He's a little mixed up
This is Uncle Roscoe, ain't it?
Hi, Uncle Roscoe
I'd ask you to alight and eat, but I think you'd better keep going, south
I ain't in any hurry
Can't you understand?
There's gonna be a posse after you
Not after me I ain't done nothin'
- Ain't you gonna alight?
- No, he's gonna keep going
You can't be as thick-headed as that
This country's full of men just aiming to shoot you on sight
- Get outta here while you still can
- You heard what she said
- Get going
- Who are you?
He's my brother Avery
Now, are you going?
All right
Come on Uncle Roscoe
Cherry
Cherry
Let me in, Cherry
That's just the way it was
One punch and Ira Waggoner was flat in the road
Wish he'd broken his neck That's what I get for tyin' up with somebody I ain't never seen
- You don't even know Waggoner?
- I never saw him Leo picked him
It was fixed that the shotgun guy that got me was gonna be left behind
Outside the horse, there wasn't supposed to be no shootin'
- I got a good mind to blast his belly open
- That's right
- Get outta here!
- I was
Never mind Get to town and look for Leo, so I don't have to slope outta here by myself
Sure, Monte
You stay here
Now, what about this fella?
- He's nothing but a tramp cowhand
- Stop talking like a fool or like I'm a fool
How do you know he ain't one of Luke Packard's men?
Come on, Monte Sit down
There Now, he's nothing but a tramp cowhand who just wandered into Payneville with an old side rider
On account of the initials on his saddle, they took him for you
Cotton was fixing to shoot him when I got this idea
I figured the best thing I could do was help them keep on thinking he was you
Tomorrow, the posse'll be ridin' after him
50 miles from here, and the north'll be wide open for you
- See anything wrong about that?
- Yeah
Nobody's as stupid as you make him out to be
He's just a common, ordinary, useless bronc stomper, like you see any way you looked around here
He'd have done anything I asked him to
He would, huh?
He did, didn't he?
He kinda liked you?
Yeah, it looked like it
That's what I thought it was
You better be glad he did, too
There's something maybe you better remember
And never mind tellin' me how it didn't mean nothin' to you
Just don't monkey around with nobody at all, unless you wanna see their belly blasted open
In my life, I ain't never been so low in my mind as since I talked to that there girl
If we aim to get across that line, we ought to hustle up these ponies
- I don't aim to cross any line
- What are you talking about?
I don't aim to get across any line because that's what she wants us to do
I worked that out before her mouth shut
- You mean there ain't no posse?
- Sure, and it's probably trailin' us
There wouldn't be if she hadn't sicked it on us
Are you telling me that there pretty lady is a skunk?
Something happened back there we don't know what it is
If that posse's trailing us to the south, it'd make an opening for somebody to get away to the north
- I can't believe it
- Where is that somebody else now?
If what you say is a fact, he's hid out round that same place
- That's the way I figured it too
- Leastways, if she ain't, he
Wait a minute, Melody
You ain't gotta be no dumber than necessary
That would make me somebody
The man that took Monte Jarrad
- Now, you look here
- You don't understand, George
But for one hour back there
I felt what it felt like to be high-regarded
- I'm never gonna feel the same again
- But that fella's a killer
I might even get you can't tell get to be sheriff
(gunshot)
That or a corpse One or the other
Now, you just listen to me
- Where are you goin'?
- Back
But listen, Melody Melody!
You go on if you want to
If only you could shoot a little better
(howling)
What are we supposed to be doing?
Playing Indians?
You gonna ask her where he is?
I ain't figured out yet what I'm gonna do
I was mixed up in shootin' once I can't tell you how quick I got sick of the whole idea
Mm-hm!
- He's changed, Avery
- He can't help it He's in trouble
They're chasin' him and he's wounded
No, it's more than that
You know, when we were all kids together, just growin' up, he was kind of wild, of course
That's why I was so crazy about him, I guess
But it ain't wildness now He's mean
Plain, downright mean
And he's gettin' meaner all the time
There she is now Ask her
What you got in this mattress? Skulls?
Take your dirty feet off my bed
You've really got a crust
- My horse run off and I
- Shh!
Look, I don't know if you're crazy, but you've gotta get out of here
- I'll get you another horse and saddle
- I couldn't leave without Henry
- Your partner?
- No, Henry's my horse
I couldn't leave him, specially with his bridle on
- Where is your partner?
- George?
He's out somewhere in the brush
He's the nervous type
Oh
In some kind of a fix, ain't you?
Of course not All I'm trying to do is to keep you out of a fix
Don't you see?
That's why I took you out of town
You mean when you called me Monte in the middle of the street?
You've got it crazy about this Monte, ain't you?
Look, I'll tell you what I'll do
I'll make a deal with you
(dog barks and growls)
- What'd you do that for?
- Your dog's seen something
Somebody's prowling around out there
Your partner, maybe
No, he'd fall over something
Sounds like he's gone now
What kind of a deal?
Will you do somethin' for me?
Sure
- Stay in this room until morning?
- Do what?
Sleep here, in that bed?
For me? Will you?
- Why?
- I'll explain it in the morning
I just don't want you goin' outta here tonight
- All right
- You promise?
Sure
Thank you
- And for Pete's sake, stay put this time, will you?
- Mm
- Thanks Good night
- Uh
You don't wanna sit and talk a spell first?
Heaven forbid
- Stick 'em up
- You surely took long enough about it
- You heard me?
- I been listenin' to you for about five minutes
You always wanna shoot 'em in the right eye
Spoils their aim
I went back into town last night
To look into things
What'd you find out?
The way it looks now, as long as you keep on lettin' anybody think you're Monte Jarrad, you've got five chances of being hung or shot, which a fella tells me is a record in these parts
How come?
One the sheriff's got just about everybody in this county in a posse that ain't got no other aim in life but to catch you and hang you
Two there's a family in this county named Cotton that you killed three members of five years ago
This family, which has got about 150 uncles and cousins, is conducting an independent hunt to kill you ahead of the posse
Three?
Three if neither one of them crowds get you, the express company has got its men here because 40,000 dollars in cash was taken off that stage.
Some say 40 million, but that sounds like an overstatement to me
Four failing all them people gettin' you, you can look for the United States Cavalry to arrive
There was some mail on that stage
They aim to kill you both 'cause you is
Monte Jarrad and 'cause you ain't Monte Jarrad, and they just don't like to be disappointed
You said five
And five if you keep on looking at a certain female lady the way you've been,
I think we could count on Monte Jarrad himself to take a hand in the shooting soon
If this Monte Jarrad is such a well-known, popular sort of a jigger,
- how come I get mistook for him?
- Monte ain't been back for five years
Besides, you ain't run into nobody that knowed him good
You ain't fooled nobody that really knowed Monte
- I got a message for you
- I don't know nobody in Payneville
It was hardly a social introduction, but you did knock him over
Name's Ira Waggoner
He drove the stage that Monte held up
- How'd he know about me?
- He don't
"Give this to Monte," he said
Everybody thinks you're him
Everybody but this little lady skunk you're taking up with
(Cherry) Skunk, huh?
Mornin'
Cherry George didn't mean that
He was just shootin' off his face
- No, he's right
- Look, Cherry
Aw, what George thinks ain't what I think
You go on about your business any which way you wanna go
Now, look here There ain't any use to this
- You don't have to cry
- Please I am a skunk, and I know it
You ain't a skunk
You've been nice, even though you knew I was lyin'
I'm sorry I drug you into it Goodbye
Look, what kind of a box is it you're in?
Can't you tell me?
You see, I've known Monte Jarrad ever since we was kids
We grew up together
So when he rode in hurt, I tried to help him
- Did you get him out?
- No
They'll catch him now, I guess
The posse'll be pounding back by this evening
When I told you that I'd explain,
I decided to tell you the whole truth and see if you'd help me
Take a saddle, or anything to lead the posse away
There just wasn't nobody else I could turn to
You'd do anything for that belly gunner
This morning I decided not to
It wouldn't be fair dragging you in no further
I was gonna tell you the truth all right
I wasn't gonna ask you to do nothin' else
That why you brung
Monte's saddle along with you?
What?
Why, I didn't know it was there
I thought you might have noticed it when you put this blanket over it
I don't know why I even try to lie to you
Me neither
Come on, Henry
- What are you doing?
- Changing saddles
- You're gonna do it?
- It's what you wanted, ain't it?
Well, yes, but
Melody, you can make it, can't you?
I hope so.
They'll see you with the saddle and tell which way you went
You'll have such a lead, you'll make it
If you mean do I aim to get caught, the answer is no
A fella can stand just so much of that pounding, and then
I'm awful grateful to you
Is there something I can do for you, maybe?
Sure You can take care of my saddle
All right
Melody, ride as hard as you can and don't stop for nothin'
Goodbye
Well, that sinks the duck
Thank you
Thank you
- I meant goodbye
- Goodbye
Would you take something from me for keeps?
I won it for bronc stomping last year at Cherryenne
I was 17th.
Thanks, champ
Giddy-up!
Melody! Where you goin'?
Melody!
Whoa
He's gone with your saddle
You can see it a mile off
You said last night he'd left the house
Where'd he stay?
I don't know, Monte He just disappeared
- Start movin'
- Sure, Monte
You know what I'd do if you crossed me
I know you're in trouble, but I don't like that kind of talk
I didn't ask you what you liked
Just be careful what you're doin'
I'm gonna pick up Uncle Roscoe, and then I'm on my way
When you get through with what I told you to do,
I'll send for you Be ready
- Can I get by?
- Ten
- Up ten
- I call
You fellas oughta let people pass when they ask you
- Waggoner
- Back
You wanna see me?
Sit down
You needn't keep watching my gun
You couldn't stop it
There's only three men in these parts
I can't slap leather with One is Monte Jarrad
- But you ain't him
- No?
No You had me fooled for a time, but not after I thunk it over
But you're frontin' for him, and that's all I wanna know
Where is he?
- I was fixin' to ask you that
- I done my part of that job
Now I'm waitin' for you fellas to do yours
You understand?
Mister, I'm gonna tell you the truth
I ain't got the first idea what you're talkin' about
I want my share I wanna know where that money bag is You understand that?
No.
Then you'd better start remembering You're gonna tell me before you leave this room
You mean you figure
I know where that money is?
I figure you better
Well, I don't know exactly what to say to that
Nobody else has to know
Just you and me Fifty-fifty
(Melody hums)
Mister, I swear I don't know how you've lived as long has you have.
What do you mean?
- Do you remember Morgan Earp?
- Sure
He got his spine shot in two
He had his back to a door that had glass in it
Sure What about it?
If you look behind you, you'll find just that kind of a door
That's the oldest one in the book
That glass is painted over and I know it
Maybe, but I sure wish you'd give it a second thought
- I've had just about enough of this
- So have I
Hello, Leo
- Who's this?
- I don't know
- He's trying to pass himself off as Monte
- I know He's riding Monte's saddle
- What deal you making?
- I was trying to find out about things
- What things?
- I got a certain right to
To do what?
Sit here till I ride off
Then be someplace where I can find you
You understand?
Yeah
I wanna hear some more about them rights you're so worried about
Let's go
- Me?
- Come on
Walk ahead of me until we're out in the street
Mount your pony
Mister, I'm obliged to you for getting me out of that bar
Ride by my off-stirrup, close
- I ain't goin' that way
- You go the way I tell you to
I can't understand how in Sam Hill a tramp like you found a way to kill Monte Jarrad
Get going
Stay where you are
- Now, look, I'm sick and tired
- I'm gonna smoke a cigarette
When I'm done, I'm gonna throw it away
When I throw it away, take care of yourself
Some friend of this belly-bustin' gunman,
I take it
- Say it while you can, tramp
- Figure you're good with a gun yourself
Outside of Monte,
I've never seen anybody better
All I meet today is champions
You shot Monte in the back
You wanna try again?
I aim to pull out of this fix
It ain't my squabble and there's no sense in getting myself shot
- Monte Jarrad ain't dead
- Did he give you that saddle?
- No, he didn't, but his girl did
- What girl?
- Cherry de Longpre
- Did she kill him?
Ain't nobody killed him, you lunkhead
He got hurt bad and couldn't travel fast
I took his saddle as a favour to her, to fool jackasses like you away from him
A full growed man like you could let a girl talk him into a dang fool trick like that?
All I can say is here I am
I've heard some dumb stories in my time, but that one really takes the cake
Get ready
All right
This don't make no sense to me in any particular, but let her go
Put 'em up, black hat
Higher
Take his gun, Melody
Like I told your friend, never turn your back on anything, especially a woman
It's all right, George
- This the girl?
- Ain't she a lulu?
- Get off
- Just a minute, ma'am
If you're Cherry de Longpre, you'll know I'm Leo Gledhill
How do you do, Mr Gledhill? Now get off
- I'm a friend of Monte Jarrad
- The lady said get off, Mr Gledhill
You jughead We been looking all over for you
Take Mr Gledhill for a walk out in the desert
Way out, and leave him
- Get!
- Leave him and do what?
Follow Melody to where you was headed in the first place
You're gonna get out of this country
I'm gonna take you
- How do you like that for organisation?
- You know who I am
I don't know who you are, only who you say you are
But that's who I am
You could be Luke Packard who works for the express company
- Come on, Melody
- Yes, ma'am
Too bad, partner I know just how you feel
If there's anything in the world I like, it's gettin' saved from bein' shot
# I wished I had a candy box
# To put my sweetheart in
# I'd take her out and kiss her twice
And put her back again
- # Round and round #
- Melody
You know, Monte'd kill a girl if she done to him what I done to you
That's because Monte don't understand women very well
I suppose you do?
Pa gave me a piece of advice that ain't never failed me
"If you fool around a woman, hide a dollar in your boot, then you'll come out with a dollar"
"That is," Pa says, "if you keep your boots on"
- What are you gonna do now?
- Tie up with George
Head toward Hot Creek and work around there this winter
Will you be coming back this way in spring?
Maybe Don't like it much down there in the summer
If you do, will you do something for me?
I don't like to seem impolite, but after the way things been going,
I'd better listen to what it is first
I don't blame you
This money bag that Monte took, when you come back, I want you to give it back to the express company
- Can't
- You mean you won't?
- Don't know where it is
- I'm going to show you
It's in a little adobe house
Under the window sill, there's a slab
Under that there's a space for a man to hide in if he can breathe
It's in there Monte told me when it looked like he was gonna die
- Why don't we give it back to 'em now?
- We certainly will not
- Why not?
- Monte's gotta have his chance
They're looking for him
If that money popped up here, they'd close in so tight a jack rabbit couldn't get out
- We gotta wait till he gets away
- No, I'd better turn it in right now
You can't After promising me, you wouldn't dare
Promised? When was that I promised?
Well
Well, you gotta promise now
- Oh, well
- Well, do you promise?
All right, I promise
(howling)
(howling)
Melody
I'm awful sorry I hope you understand, and maybe someday you'll forgive me
Forget it
Ain't a thing in the world you've got to worry about, as far as I'm concerned
If you ever do come back through here
I tell you, Cherry,
I'd like to see you again a whole lot
But I just don't seem to be cut out for the kind of life you folks lead around these parts
Yeah, I see
- Good evening
- Luke Packard's the name
From the express company
Lift your hands just a little higher
And you, lady, step round the other side of him
I'd certainly be embarrassed if you grabbed his iron and flung a shot at me
That's something that's been worrying me most of my life
What would I do if a woman hung the drop on me?
Boy, oh, boy
Over
These don't give much light to speak of, but they'll warm it up while we wait
- Wait for what?
- The posse
- They're swinging around this way now
- Posse?
The sheriff and some of the boys are heading up here
Go over in that corner
What they're aiming to do when they get here,
I couldn't say They didn't tell me
- But you can't do that
- No? Why can't I?
They'll kill him, not arrest him
Those Cotton boys won't let 'em
They're legal, lady Legal to the teeth
I ain't the one they're after
I ain't Monte Jarrad
I'm Melody Jones I ain't never set eyes on him
I ain't never seen the gentleman in question myself
But this is Monte Jarrad's hideout
On information received, this here girl is Monte Jarrad's lady friend
Monte Jarrad is well known to be a beanpole, such as you be
When a posse makes a mistake, it's mighty hard to unmake
Come, now Let's don't look on the dark side
What other side is there, mister?
If them Cottons get hold of me, I'm a dead duck
It ain't gonna be no good to say sorry
The fact is, I don't care a hoot whether you're Monte Jarrad or Melody Jones or Harmony Q Smith
All I'm interested in is 42,004 dollars and 85 cents belonging to the express company I work for and not another cussed thing on earth
Once I get my hands on that, you're as free as a bird
- Can I talk to this girl alone?
- Step in there if you want
- You trust me?
- 100 per cent
You'll never regret it, Mr Packard
You'd better take a light with you
Well, how do you like that?
He's no better than a cheat
I couldn't break my word in here if I wanted to
What did you wanna talk to me about?
Oh, yeah Say, what about this?
- What about what?
- About my gettin' hung over this money
- How far are you aimin' to carry this?
- You know the situation
You figure if I tell where the money is, it'll hurt that belly buster's chances of gettin' away
But what about my neck?
You have to do what you think is right, of course
You gonna hang onto that promise you trapped me into?
- I'm not gonna argue about it
- Maybe you're in love with him, but I ain't
This thing's gone just about far enough, and ten feet further
Just as you please
- Made up your mind?
- Uh-huh
Well, where is it?
- Where's what?
- The money Stop stalling
What money was it?
You realise what you're doin'? That posse ain't more than 30 minutes from here, Monte
- I ain't Monte
- I ain't got any way to force you
But I hate to see a man taken apart without a chance to defend himself
- I'll tell you where it is
- What?
The money you're after Can't you keep your mind on what we're talking about?
- If I tell you where it is, can we go?
- That was the proposition
- Which man do you aim to be the death of?
- Shut up
It's under that slab under the window
Well, what do you know about that?
Mister, you're a
(gunshot)
Then you were telling the truth
Yeah
Look out for the fella doin' the shootin'
It's the real Monte He's after the money again
Is he dead?
Yeah
Shh
There's somebody out there
- Is that the way you always draw?
- You numbskull
I'm sorry, but I couldn't be sure who was in here
- Who is it?
- Packard, the express-company fella
Well, that sinks the duck
Now they got a "corpus delict"
- A what?
- A dead body
That's the way the law says it
If they've got a corpus, you're delict
Before this, we could have proved there was a mistake
- Then why did you do it?
- We could have
- Do what?
- Shoot him
- Him?
- Why did you shoot him?
Why should I shoot the man, a perfect stranger? Why should I?
Wait a minute
Both of you, you can't hang it on me
You was under the table with your gun smokin'
How do you account for that hole?
He ran outside, shot him, then came back in?
That's right
If it wasn't you, we've got that belly buster back with us
Melody, we gotta get outta this country and quick
- Ain't nothin' holdin' me back
- All right
But first you get the pony
Keep your eyes open
Maybe somebody's still out there
Don't you think we oughta keep clotted together?
Stop trying to think Do as I say
All right
We got housekeeping to do before we leave
Give me a hand
Let's get this corpus into that box
Here, help cover up these spots
- You with us?
- You bet
Come on
Step back
You're under arrest
Light those candles, Kriendler
Let's see what's going on in here
Stick 'em up, fella
- I can't say I expected much more of you
- This him?
- Ain't it?
- Do I have to go through all that again?
Sheriff, he isn't Monte
He's just some guy that's got all mixed up
- Hold me Put me in jail
- You think I'm crazy?
They're prominent in this county, the Cottons
If I was to let him go, they're as liable to string me up
Take it easy They'll be along any minute
If he ain't who they want, they won't touch him
Look, Sheriff, if they hang me, how are you gonna find out where the money is?
(coughs)
You know where the money is, even if you ain't Monte?
- I do
- (coughs)
- What ails you?
- Nothing
Just clearing my throat
Well?
- If I tell you, can I get outta here?
- If I was you
If he opens his mouth one more time, knock him in the head
I give you my word The minute that money's in my hand, that door's open
- It's right
- (Geoge) Oh!
No!
(sheriff) That'll teach you to keep your mouth shut
Come on
Come on?
Try any monkey business and I'll blow you clear outta this house
Where's that money? You said you knew where it is Let's have it, quick
- I'm afraid I changed my mind
- I'm giving you one more chance
Tell us, or do we have to get it outta you?
I don't think I got any suggestions
Get ahold of him Pin him
Anybody touches me is gonna get their brains knocked out
(shouting and gunshots)
(shouting)
You brush ape How did you think you were gonna stop a man?
What are you doin' here?
Just lightin' a candle
Melody, why didn't you go?
I reached for you, but I couldn't find you
I couldn't leave you in all this mess
Maybe I can be as tough as this Monte Jarrad
Maybe a little bit tougher
- Let's get outta here
- They stampeded our horses
Well, what do you know?
For the last time, where's that money?
I forget
All right, put your guns away and go to work on him
Don't knock his head clear off him because he's gotta talk, and quick
You
You get over there
Get him
Whop him, Melody Whop him!
Get your hands off me
I got him
Wait a minute Bring him out here
Where is it?
Let him have it
Hold it We gotta try somethin' else
- Why?
- You'll knock him out, then what good is he?
- Want me to heat up his spurs?
- No, the way he said it, it's in this room
The way he said it, it must be
It's got to be
There's a stiff in here
Holy jumping Jupiter!
- It's Luke Packard
- Luke Packard?
It is Luke all right
Run for it
Hey!
Open this door!
Come on back!
Come back here and open this door!
Come back here!
Cherry? Cherry?
Cherry? Cherry?
Cherry? Cherry?
Monte's headed for the de Longpre range
Come on, let's go!
Cherry?
Cherry?
Cherry?
Hi
You can stop thinkin' what you're thinkin' because you won't have time to throw that can
And you're too far for that Winchester
I thought you might be that Monte Jarrad, but that can't be
- No?
- No
That weasel looks somethin' like I do
Fools people sometimes
Get over there
Take off that holster
And the boots
Don't think we look alike, hm?
I don't think I deserve people to say anything like that about me
The jumper
It ain't gonna do you no good, you know
You don't think so?
Not even if we swapped every stitch.
'Cause there still wouldn't be no scar on my face
But who'd know that if there wasn't no face left?
- Is that what you really aim to do?
- The pants
I didn't come lookin' for you just to admire you, if that's what you mean
In that case, I guess I'd better fix you too
You ain't doin' this just because it suits you to
You got something else on your mind
Yeah?
Yeah But I ain't gonna help you with it none
I'm gonna make you ask about it
All right What about it?
- What about what?
- What about Cherry?
What about her?
You'll have to be clearer than that
- You know what I'm asking you
- Sure
But you're gonna have to ask it in plain words
- What were you doin' here the other night?
- If I don't tell you, you'll never know
- You'll tell me all right
- Will I?
Don't get smart I don't like it
And you won't like it either
What could you do that you weren't gonna do already?
That's what I meant when I say
I'm gonna fix you too
I ain't gonna answer that question
I'm gonna leave you to worry about that
But she ain't yours no more
- You're lying
- You see?
That's what you're going to have to worry about
Was I lying or not?
With me gone, you'll never know
From now on, you'll have to go on wondering about that, for as long as you live, which I don't figure to be very long
Come on
The hat
(Melody hums)
Know what you are now?
YOu're just an old used-to-be.
If you don't think so, ask her yourself
She's comin' in right now
You better get out to the barn
George is there He's hurt
Bad?
I think he's dyin'
All right, go on
Why did you shoot that old man?
He come asking for it Anytime somebody comes asking for it, they're gonna get it
Found him in the gulch where you left him
Where you left him to die
You're wearin' his stuff
So the tramp was tellin' the truth
Monte, you were gonna kill him too and leave him here to be buried as yourself
Get your dumb thumb out of my eye
- I was just trying to see if you were dead
- Well, I ain't
And I don't like somebody trying to gouge my eye out
- Monte?
- Yeah I stumbled onto him up in the rocks
You can't, Monte
Look out, Melody! He's coming!
Take care of yourself, tramp
Take my gun, Melody Take it and drill him
Partner, you ain't got no gun
Get outta here They're comin'
Inside
- You two cover that door
- Yeah
Leo, the front door
- Come back here
- Stop me
(gunfire)
- Look, Melody
- Sit down
Surrender in the name of the law!
- Take that horse and cut for it
- Why don't Monte go?
He can't race a horse with that wound, but you can
She's right You can't do no more damage around here
- No, I ain't goin'
- Why not?
Horse like that can't carry three people
Looks like we're gonna have company
- Did you get him?
- What for?
I ain't got anything against them fellas out there
- Get down You'll get your head shot off
- Why did you shoot?
He was shootin' too straight
George
Listen, George, only one thing about this business still puzzles me
- What's that?
- What I'm doin' in it
You was gonna make somethin' out of yourself
- Don't you remember?
- That's right
You was gonna take Monte and be somebody
- That sounds kinda silly now, I reckon
- (gunfire continues)
All I'm askin' you now is, tell me when you figure you is somebody so we can get the heck out of this shootin' gallery
Is that really why you stayed?
Well, not exactly
The truth is, I hadn't hardly got into that idea good before I kinda got sick of it
Too jumpy to suit my taste
Why did you ride back into Payneville?
You was all tangled up in something
I couldn't rightly figure out what
No use tryin' to talk sense into your head
The only way to get you out was for me to try to get inside and bust open the whole shebang
It never occurred to me that maybe you had reasons not to want to get out
Melody
What is it, Uncle Roscoe?
Where's my gun?
You ain't got no gun, George
You'd better give me one, Melody
If them fellas break in you're gonna need some help
Here you are, George
Got it?
Yeah
Don't make out you're worse off than you are, George
Here Drink some of this
(gunfire continues)
(hums vey softly)
We can't stand for this from nobody, George
- Hey, now
- That all you got? Four?
- What are you doin'?
- Nothin' you can stop, son
- Stop him, Avery!
- Come back here, you
I'm sorry
Hey, Monte Jarrad!
What about it?
What about it, Monte?
How about it, Monte?
M e eoedyyy, po eassse
I'm waitin'
Hey, men! Hold your fire!
Hold your fire! Let 'em shoot it out!
This one's for that scar on your face
You're walkin' too good
That one was a little too close
No face left, remember?
Thanks, partner
# I'm a poor lonesome cowboy
# I'm a poor lonesome cowboy
# I ain't got no sweetheart
# I'm a long way from home #
Come on You can bring your hat this time
# I ain't got no sweetheart
# I ain't got no sweetheart
# I'm a poor lonesome cowboy #
What a dumb town!
They catch you and then they don't hang you
They slung me in and they slung me out
- You still tryin' to make out you're bad off?
- Have you ever?
- What's this?
- Reward for drilling Monte
They held back 25 dollars for the doctor, five dollars on a charge of vagrancy, three weeks' rent for living in the jail when I wasn't guilty
- Why are you givin' it to me?
- You brung him down
Me? I couldn't have brung down a two-week-old baby
I was so dreamy, I couldn't hardly move, let alone use a drilling iron
But you had to, George It wasn't me
That shot came straight from this barn
- Avery?
- Flat out
- Pop, maybe?
- No, I had his gun
This is awful, George Awful
Who do you care saved your life?
I'd let anybody save mine
- I'm givin' up
- Givin' up what?
Everything I ain't gonna make no further fool of myself about her
- What in the Sam Hill are you talking about?
- She knowed him long before me
It was him or me, one or the other
She had a right to shoot at whoever she wanted to
Melody, if you mean what I think you mean, get outta my sight
- You ain't worthy for me to know
- I've been kiddin' myself too long
I know who she was aimin' at
Come in
Hello
- I was looking for my saddle
- Behind the curtain
What's that?
The reward
Oh
- I hoped you wouldn't take it like that
- I ain't blamin' you
It ain't no disgrace to be saved by a woman
What kind of a chump do you take me for?
You think I don't know who you were shootin' at?
- What?
- Look, Cherry
When a fella puts himself between a fella and his girl, he's got to look out on both sides
- He's got to be ready
- You mean I was shootin' at you?
I ain't blamin' you You had to make a quick pick which fella you wanted
I'm mighty glad you ain't any better shot than you are
Thanks for takin' care of my saddle for me
Why, you you butter-fingered gun juggler
Melody
Cherry!
Hold it
When I aim at somethin', I hit it
And when I hit somethin', that's what I aimed at
Don't tell me she missed you all three times
- I've changed my mind, George
- What now?
I decided I don't wanna be sheriff
Well, that's a right smart decision
I'm thinking it's about time
I was thinking about settling down
A fella that knew about ranching could make this dump into a nice place
- If he had a good foreman
- You ask her?
- Ask her what?
- For the job, you numpus
- You don't think I ought to go to Pop?
- Go away You disgust me
Well, if you think that's the way
(Melody hums)
(Cherry) Melody, stop it
Stop it, I tell you Stop
My goodness
You don't have to be so rough about it
Hey, look at that!
Look. Right through him.
Prospector.
Skinny little feller. Them bones ain't hardly as big as my little finger.
Let me see it.
Apache.
Apache country, ain't it?
There are a few Apaches around here.
Mostly they're farther south.
That's all we need- to run into some crazy Indians.
All this country around here like this?
Pretty much.
Up north there are lots of canyons and draws... if you know which ones are open.
Those hills over there back right up into the mountains.
Those are salt flats down south.
Even a rattlesnake
couldn't get across 'em.
I wonder if she's got any plans after she gets through ridin' that horse.
What'll it be?
- Well, this is a whiskey saloon, ain't it?
- We got whiskey.
Then we'll have whiskey.
- Beat it.
- Give him one.
It ain't necessary.
They tell me this town was full of
Confederate sympathizers during the war.
- Is that right?
- There was some seceshes here.
I was a Union man myself.
You ask anybody. They'll tell you.
Well, what about the marshal?
He a Union man too?
I never ask a man his politics.
Where is he now?
- Around.
- No, he ain't.
He's out puttin' up tax warrants.
I seen him go.
You fellows plannin' on bein' in town long?
Depends on what you got to offer.
Depends on what you got
on your mind, sonny.
- Where do you keep your water?
- There's a well out back.
Let's fill 'em up- all of 'em.
I'll take care of my own.
Hand me another bottle.
A full one.
Yes, sir. I sure would like to know what she plans to do... after she gets through ridin' that horse.
Now lay down, everybody.
Why don't you do like he said?
Never mind, you.
Open it up.
Drop back, Jed.
Keep your eyes open.
Just like robbin' a kid's piggy bank.
I kinda liked that town.
Nice and obligin'.
Yee-ah!
Fire!
Let 'em go! Save us the trouble of hanging 'em.
Whoa.
Whoa! Whoa!
Them garrison soldiers just can't take country like this.
Maybe they've got sense.
Sure was mighty inconsiderate of old Jed to get hisself killed like that.
He owed me six bits.
I'd feel a lot better if there were seven of us instead of six.
This desert's a mighty unlucky place.
A man needs all the odds he can get.
Hey, that reminds me.
Hadn't we better be starting back?
- Back where?
- Where we come from.
Right into the lovin' arms of the army?
Are you crazy? Why, it's a good 70 miles across this sink. Maybe more.
It's just a place.
A place can be crossed.
Speak for yourself.
I'm easing back, soon as it's dark.
Well, that's up to you.
There's your share.
Make your choice.
I sure never thought
I'd come to this... but I guess I'm gonna have to trade some whiskey for some water.
Ain't nobody gonna trade me some water for a good swig of real nice whiskey?
Put that back!
Give me that!
Look out, you fool!
You'll spill it!
- Give it to me!
- Oh, no, you don't!
Give it back!
Give it to me! Give it to me!
- Give it to me! Give it to me!
- Oh, no, you don't!
Leave go of his canteen...
and cut it out!
You too!
You shouldn't oughta done that, Stretch.
You might've hurt me.
Oh, my poor feet.
The way they hurt.
If I didn't know better,
I'd say it was gonna rain.
Walrus, bring your horse up here.
Kind of noble, aren't you?
A horse is a useful animal.
No use lettin' him suffer just because he belongs to a jackass.
Looks like he's not the only jackass on this trip.
I told you we'd never make it.
Nobody said you had to come.
Old Walrus here has got nearly a thousand dollars in his pocket.
Can't even buy hisself a drink of water.
Don't that beat the devil?
Look at that old lizard there.
He's better off than you, Walrus.
Yes, sir, a heap better off.
That ain't right.
You got no call to do that.
What's eatin' you?
It's just a lizard.
It wasn't doin' you no hurt.
What'd you have to kill it for?
Well, of all the-
Say, what's got into you anyhow?
- A lizard!
- Shut up.
All this fuss over one little lizard.
If I don't get some water pretty soon...
I'm just gonna fall down and die.
Yeah, it looks that way.
Come on, boy.
Come on. Come on.
I think I see... a town over there.
It is a town. I can see it.
I can see it! It's a town.
Water. Water!
It's a dead one.
A ghost!
We just come in across the sink.
We need water bad.
There's a spring here, but you'll never make it.
You just point it out.
We'll make it.
It's up behind those big rocks at the head of the street.
Get up.
Water.
Anybody home?
What about me coming in for a minute?
- Stay where you are.
- What you scared of?
Nothin'.
What are you carryin' that gun for?
Ain't nobody gonna shoot nobody.
- What do you want?
- Somethin' to eat.
How long are you gonna stay here?
Four or five days maybe.
Hard to say.
It ain't far to Alkali.
You can make it easy if you try.
Horses need rest.
So do we.
I ain't got enough in the house to feed six men.
We got money, if that's what's botherin' you.
I don't want your money.
I just want you to get outta here.
We aim to. Meanwhile, we can't live on fresh air.
Now, listen, lady. I don't know why
I'm standin' here arguing with you.
There's six of us, and we usually take what we want.
Not from around here.
All right, lady.
If that's the way you feel about it.
I don't like women who act so high and-
Why, you dirty, little-
I wouldn't go stirrin' up no trouble
with that girl if I was you, young fella.
Quite a punch you got there, ma'am.
Come in mighty handy when you get married.
You're right, son.
She's as tough as a pine nut.
She oughta be.
She was raised with Apaches.
- Apaches?
- Yeah. Fine people if you understand them.
- Any of 慹m around here?
- Oh, from time to time.
- Come on, Grandpa.
- Just a minute.
What about that food?
Do we get it peaceful or don't we?
Well, we might arrange for one night, Mike... seein' what a lean belly he's got.
I'll send a couple of the boys up after it.
You shouldn't have given in to him like that, Grandpa.
I know what I'm doin'.
Don't feed 'em, and right away they begin "suspicioning."
Now, you act as if nothing had happened and leave this to me.
What you goin' to all that trouble for, Dude?
- You ain't hardly seen her yet.
- He's seen her all right.
Course, it was kinda worm's-eye view- him right at her feet eatin' dust.
What do you reckon a girl like her's doin' anyway livin' in a town like this?
The old man's a prospector, most likely.
A little loony. Lots of old-timers like him all through these hills.
- Yeah, but her?
- Somebody's got to look after the old fool.
Hmm. Look!
Kinda cute-lookin', ain't she?
Right nice swing to them hips too.
Yeah. And when she tucks in that shirt-
Better let me help you with that bucket, ma'am.
- Looks heavy.
- I can manage.
Just the same, ma'am, somebody oughta help
you carry that bucket up to the house.
Well, now wait a minute, lady.
You don't mean you'd shoot a big, handsome fellow like me?
If you got to shoot somebody... why, pick on Half Pint or Walrus.
They don't amount to nothin' nohow.
I've told you once.
Well, as long as I'm goin' your way anyhow-
You heard what she said.
Sit down.
- But I was just-
- Shut up.
- I got a right to-
- Shut up!
You gotta hit some people in the head with an ax.
Now, listen, all of you. I'm figurin' on layin' up here for three or four days... till the horses get their legs back, and I don't want any unnecessary trouble.
- Stay away from those people.
- Listen. You ain't-
Yes, I am. I ain't talkin' just to hear my own voice.
I'm ordering you.
If I catch any of you messin' around that house, somebody's gonna get hurt.
- Is that clear?
- That include you too?
That includes everybody.
There's an old saloon down at the other end of the town.
We'll bunk in it.
Gets kinda cold around here at night.
- Where you goin'?
- Outside.
I can't sleep nohow with this fathead snorin' like a wounded buffalo.
Turn over!
Sure is still tonight, ain't it?
I wonder what Dude's up to.
Brother, am I sure gonna throw a shoe if he gets anyplace with that gal.
From what I saw, she'll tear him in two if he tries anything.
What are you doin' here?
Lookin' for one of my men.
I told you if anybody came up here, he was liable to get shot.
I wish you wouldn't keep pointin' that thing at me.
Women got no business carryin' guns.
- They're apt to shoot somebody they don't mean to.
- Not me.
You know, if you was prettied up a bit... you might look almost like a female.
You-
Just wanted to show you how safe you'd be if I really wanted to get rough.
You smell. Even Apaches are cleaner than you.
Why, you-
Didn't anybody ever tell you before that you smell bad?
Mike! Mike!
What happened?
It's nothin', Grandpa.
It's just-
I just caught someone prowlin' around out here.
Did you get him good?
Maybe I should have.
Good thing she can shoot as straight as she can, young fella.
Most women'd have lost their heads at a time like this, and you'd have been done for.
Ain't every girl can miss
that close... on purpose.
- Do you need any help?
- No!
Better be gettin'
back on inside, honey.
Ain't likely he'll bother anybody else tonight.
He's gonna be kinda dizzy.
Mike, how'd you come to shoot him?
I don't know.
He grabbed me.
He made me feel-
I don't know.
I wish I'd let him die of thirst when he came here.
What were you doing up there?
I was lookin' for you.
I guess you didn't hear what I said about stayin' away from that girl.
Looks like you didn't even hear it yourself.
Anyhow, I wasn't bothering about her.
I was just nosing around, following a hunch.
- What kind of a hunch?
- Gold.
It doesn't make sense-
that old man and a girl like her...
living up here just for their health.
Sure enough, they've got half a dozen cradles and a big sluice box down in the canyon.
Well, how do you know it's not just old equipment left around here like everything else?
Because there's a shack down there too.
Apaches been living in it.
I could smell 'em
the minute I opened the door.
Strong as a fox's den.
Well, suppose they have found some gold, what of it?
Too much money layin' around in banks for us to worry about any little dab they got.
Maybe it isn't so little.
Well, anyhow, we're not sticking around to find out.
We're movin' on as soon as the horses are fit.
Well, I don't know about you... but I'm getting a little tired of all this robbery business.
I've got a bullet floating around in me, right here.
Some tinhorn gambler who yelled like a stuck pig... because he dropped a few hundred dollars.
Claimed he'd been cheated.
Which he had, but that's neither here nor there.
I don't know if I ever told you... but I used to have a big faro layout in San Juan.
Best-looking woman in camp waiting on me hand and foot.
Then bang-
Along comes this tinhorn- puts a bullet in me.
When I got on my feet again,
the money was all gone.
Her too.
She lit out with a fellow who ended up beating her.
Which wasn't a bad idea either.
As for me, I was just a down-at-the-heels sharper... with one bad lung, looking for a stake.
But I told them
I'd come back, loaded.
That's why I joined up with you.
Maybe now's the time.
Not interested.
Just thought I'd mention it.
Need any help getting back to bed?
I'm staying here for the rest of the night.
I'll send the kid with your saddle and blanket.
By the way... that woman I was telling you about in San Juan-
Her name was Lucy.
This girl kind of reminds me of her.
Same figure.
Now wait a minute, boss. I ain't doin' nothin' none of the rest of them ain't doin'.
- And what's that?
- Lookin' for the old man's gold, like Dude said.
Where are the old man and the girl?
They're up in the hills somewhere.
They lit out as soon as they heard us comin'.
- Put that down and come with me.
- All right, boss.
All right.
Get in there where I can see what you're doing.
So you fellows figure you got a new boss, eh?
- We want that gold.
- Dude said you wasn't interested.
- So we took a vote and-
- Decided that Dude's the leader. Is that it?
It just happens that votes don't mean a thing to me.
You wanna get rid of me, you've gotta run me out.
You ain't got no objections to bein' rich, have you?
We ain't arguin' about that now.
We're talkin' about who's boss.
Personally I don't care who's boss... long as we get that gold.
Now you're talkin'.
No sense bangin' away like that, Mike.
You're just usin' up good bullets.
If I could just get one of 慹m, it might change their minds.
Looks like they got gold all right.
- Yeah, that's what we've been tellin' you.
- Let's get it.
My way. Understand?
Gonna get mighty hot up on that hill after a while.
Them two'll get good and thirsty.
All we gotta do is sit tight.
Sit tight?
Like a bunch of scared rabbits?
- Well, there's six of us. Let's root 'em out.
- Go ahead.
It couldn't be that you're worrying about somebody else getting killed, could it?
You and Lengthy get in the house... and see if you can find out where they got the ammunition hid.
Cinch they couldn't carry it all up there.
You and Bull Run look around the barn.
Whew.
Mighty hot sun.
Almost tempts a man to drink water.
Well, I declare!
There's one of them
wavin'a flag of truce.
Tryin' everything, I guess.
It don't seem exactly right to shoot a man wavin' a white flag, Mike.
I'll teach them to come around here, chasin' us out of our house.
Wait till he gets up a little closer.
You can always get him if he gets nasty.
That's close enough.
It's the only white shirt we got in the outfit. Belongs to Dude.
He's kind of particular.
Don't wanna get it dirty.
Look, I shaved.
Changed my shirt too.
Smell like a lily.
Even combed my hair, right around the part you gave me.
What do you want?
I thought maybe you and me could make a deal.
There's only one deal we'll make with you:
Get out of Yellow Sky and stay out, or we'll shoot the lot of you.
Them bullets of yours ain't gonna last forever. We found your ammunition.
Soon as you use up the ones you got, my boys are gonna come up and get you.
Well, at least you won't be among 'em.
Oh, don't a flag of truce mean nothin' to you?
With thieves like you?
Now, nobody's gonna hurt you if they can help it.
But we know you got gold, and we're gonna get it.
Come on back to the house and tell us where
it's hid. Maybe we'll cut you in for some.
You might as well be comfortable while you're gettin' robbed.
Ask him what kind of a deal.
You can't make a deal with him, Grandpa.
Fifty-fifty's better than nothin'.
Anyhow, it don't do no harm to ask.
Sit down and keep your hands in sight.
We haven't made up our minds yet what we're gonna do with you.
Get down!
Dirty, double-crossin'-
Grandpa!
Oh, I gotta get you back to the house.
It's bleedin' bad.
Oh, I've bled before.
Hold your fire!
They're givin' up!
Bull Run and Walrus, get up there.
Somebody's been hit.
I sure hope it ain't that girl.
I got a different future picked out for her.
I've seen a lot worse than that.
Didn't even break no bone.
Don't look like you got no lead to probe for neither.
Don't look like you got no lead to probe for neither.
That's right. Just got a hole in my leg.
Uh, probing is usually a two-quart job.
You'll have to excuse us, ma'am.
You see, we're used to men getting shot... and the boys just haven't stopped to remember...
that this is your grandfather
and the only one you've got.
Look, why don't you go?
Can't you see he wants to go to sleep?
I think we oughta get this deal of ours settled right now.
- Where's the gold?
- He can't talk now.
Tomorrow when he's feeling better, he'll tell you anything you wanna know.
- All right, Mike. Might as well get it over with.
- But, Grandpa, you're not-
If we don't, first thing you know, they'll be twisting my arm for me.
Did you ever have a fellow twist your arm for you?
It don't feel so good.
Get me my pipe.
I don't supposed it'd do any good to tell you boys...
we haven't got any gold?
Yeah, that's what I thought.
You'd just keep hunting for it until you'd made a nuisance of yourself...
until somebody got killed.
Now, wouldn't you?
Suppose I admit that we have got some gold... but don't tell you where it is?
Now, you wouldn't do a mean thing like that to us, would you, Grandpa?
Let me give you boys a little history of things here.
About 15 years ago, heavy silver
was hit here in Yellow Sky.
The town boomed overnight.
Me and Mike here-
Oh, she was just a baby then.
I was a young fellow myself- not a day over 60.
Well, we was late gettin' here... and didn't manage to put our hands on anything worthwhile anyhow...
so it didn't matter one way or the other
to us when the veins pinched out.
Well, it was right hard goin' for us for a while... but we finally hit on what we were lookin' for.
Pretty soon we hired us two or three young Apaches... from the old chief, Colorado.
Then things began to hum.
You know, I've been smokin' a pipe for 60 years.
I'm still havin' trouble with my puffer.
Yeah. What was I talkin' about?
Gold.
Oh, yes. Yes.
Mighty dangerous thing...
if you want it
out of plumb greediness.
I've seen it ruin many a man.
Of course, I had good reasons for wantin' it myself.
Now, Mike here-
I'm the only one she's got.
So, you see, I wanted to see her
took good care of before I died.
Come to the point.
What about our deal?
- What's your idea of a deal?
- Depends on how much you got.
- Well, now, countin' the dust-
- Don't tell 'em, Grandpa.
- Don't tell 'em anything more!
- Well, Mike, I thought-
I had to do something. I couldn't let you stay up there and die.
- Now, listen, ma'am.
I've been tryin' to be patient with you-
- That money's yours, Grandpa.
I know how hard you worked and sweated for it.
They got no right to it. Of course, you can't understand that, can you?
'Cause you're no good.
None of you.
- You're just born takers.
- You still haven't said how much you got.
It ain't just the money.
Look at him. He's an old man.
All he's dreamed about is seein'
this town come to life again...
with people livin' here and
workin' and-and stores open.
The stage comin' through from Alkali.
And all because of him and what he done.
You see, Mike? They don't even know what you're talkin' about.
Uh, how about 50-50?
How much?
Oh, 50,000.
Fifty thousand dollars?
Around that.
I think maybe we can do business.
Where is it?
Go show 'em, Mike.
Mike?
It's cached in the mouth of that old silver mine up under those big rocks.
When you came here this morning, we went up and knocked out a few timbers.
It's buried now.
- If you want it, you'll have to dig for it.
- Want it?
Oh, my back feels like it's broke.
From now on, I'm stickin' to robbin' banks.
You sure don't catch that old Dude doin' no work.
Oh, he wouldn't be no good nohow... with that lung of his.
'Sides, somebody's got to keep an eye on the girl and the old man, don't they?
That's what's bothering me.
He may keep too close an eye on her.
Why don't you shut up about that girl?
Once you get your hands on all this gold, she won't look no better than a broken-down squaw.
Well, that's a lie.
She'll never look anything but pretty.
Well, of all the-
You too?
Whoa!
Go on, Lengthy!
Go on and kiss her!
She ain't got no gun on her this time!
Ride her, cowboy!
Ride her!
But watch yourself.
- Ow!
- Looks like she's got a burr under her saddle!
Why, you-
Let him up!
Let him up!
You let him go!
Let him up.
- Let him up!
- I ain't lettin' nobody up.
He hit me, and I'm gonna give it to him... good!
You fellows just won't listen to me, will ya?
It wasn't my fault. She came down here
swingin' herself pretty fancy.
- I'll leave it to Walrus.
- That's right, boss.
Looks like she was just askin' for trouble.
From now on, stay away from my men...
and stop swinging your hips
all over the place!
I don't know what you're so sore about.
She's just a girl.
I ain't gonna argue about it.
Still worryin' about what happened this afternoon?
Nah.
- You're mad at me.
- No, I ain't mad at nobody.
Just thinkin', huh?
That house up there...
keeps remindin' me
of our place back home in Ohio.
I just see my mama now, standin' on the back porch... callin' me to come in from whatever I was doin'.
And my old man yellin' at me to "Wash your hands before supper, Luke, doggone it."
And all of us sittin' down, and him sayin' grace.
Poor boy.
I was afraid that was it.
You're in love.
I got a right to remember, haven't I?
Sure.
- Let me go.
- Why?
Thought you was enjoyin' it.
We got... no business kissin' each other, you and me.
- Look here, lady.
This ain't somethin' you argue about.
- No. No. No!
What's the matter?
Where you goin'?
Inside.
Grandpa'll be missin' me.
Oh, he can't be in that much of a hurry.
- His leg hurts him. He's worried.
- What about?
- You runnin' off with all the gold and leavin' us nothing.
- I gave him my word, didn't I?
Yeah, your word.
Thought I'd... drop in, see how you're gettin' along.
Sit down.
Uh-
I thought maybe it might... ease your mind some about that gold...
- if you knew somethin' about me.
- What kind of somethin'?
Well... that I come from good people.
When I give my word, I mean it.
My folks was all farmers, sound stock.
They moved to Kansas from Indiana when I was about two years old.
Folks went through all the worst of the Border War.
Old man come pretty near gettin' killed
by some of Quantrill's men.
Seems like I had a gun in my hand ever since I was about so high.
Somebody always shootin' at us
or us shootin' at them.
Either chasin' somebody or gettin' chased.
Then a few years ago, along come an epidemic.
My old man died. Ma too.
- Course I was off in the army by then.
- Which side?
Blue pants.
My ma was sure a stickler for religion.
Church was about 10 miles away, but she used to go every Sunday, winter or summer.
I remember one Sunday, her and me
almost got lost in a blizzard.
I could read the Bible by the time
I was seven years old.
We used to have one of them big, thick ones...
with all the family births
and deaths and marriages in it.
- Why are you tellin' us all this?
- Ah, just sort of talkin'.
I been givin' that deal of ours a little thought, and, uh-
I figured maybe with you
laid up here and all...
you're gettin'
kind of worried about it.
All I can say is that I'm stickin' to it a hundred percent.
I've seen some mighty big liars in my time.
Now, if you ain't tellin' the truth-
That's a Bible there, ain't it?
Yes.
I ain't seen one in years.
I hereby swear on this good book... that I'm goin' through with our deal...
to the letter.
Well, young man... if you don't mean it...
I don't see no point in you comin' here blasphemin'.
Shake on it.
I guess I better be goin'.
Haven't you got any better name than Mike?
Constance Mae.
Dawson's mine.
James Dawson.
Ah- I guess the war has upset a lot of those boys... and set them off on the wrong foot.
You know, I've seen a lot worse fellows than him keep their word.
I'll put out your light now, Grandpa.
It's time for you to go to sleep.
Yeah.
Come on.
Let's get it.
- Come on!
- Come on.
Ah, we've been sold. Maybe the sacks are buried around here somewhere.
Here's one of them.
Here it is. I've got it!
Look out. It'll cave in!
I'm gonna get me some new clothes.
Hey, look. What's that?
Holy Moses.
Apaches.
Looks like that old man wasn't as... loony as we figured.
Yeah. Let us dig his gold out for him... then his Indians show up just when we find it.
Maybe those folks are... worse off than we are.
Aw, shut up, you jape.
They told us them Apaches was friends of theirs, didn't they?
We're sure gonna be mighty rich corpses.
Funny they haven't rushed us.
Maybe they're waitin' for sunup.
Indians always like sunup.
We better try to find out what they're gonna do.
- Wait a minute. What about all that gold?
- You carry it.
Maybe you fellas are givin' up on that gold, but I ain't.
I want it now out of just plain ornery meanness.
Stay here.
Well, that was quite a little powwow.
Yeah. Apaches like to hear theirselves talk.
Looks like they ain't the only ones around here.
All right, turn 'em loose on us.
They may finish us, but we'll get
our share of them before they do.
Do you think I'd turn crazy drunk Apaches loose on ya?
They're friends of yours, ain't they?
- Why, yes, but I-
- You sent for 'em, didn't you?
Well, did you or didn't you?
Why, I didn't know they was within 50 miles of here...
till some of the boys that used to work
for me slipped in here last night.
Seems like they'd had some trouble over
at the reservation. They were out to kill.
Took a lot of coaxin' on my part,
but I... finally got them to promise...
to bring the big chief here
to talk to me.
You know, he's an old friend of mine.
I just got through telling them... that if they went back to the reservation and behaved theirselves...
I'd talk to the Indian agent myself
and have their troubles took care of.
Huh. Took a heap of arguing on my part.
That's what they're gonna do.
What about us?
Why, I told 'em you was working for me.
Reckon what them fool Indians are up to now?
Maybe Stretch give the old man a good talkin' to.
He's a great one for makin' deals.
It's that honest face of his.
One look at him and you say,
"By gum, there's an honest thief."
For all we know, they'll be back.
So let's stop shooting off our mouths and start loading this gold.
I wouldn't be in too big
a hurry about that if I was you.
Where'd you come from?
I told you to meet me behind them rocks. You didn't do it.
- Well, you see, Dude here-
- I'm givin' the orders around here.
We'll talk about that later.
Right now, we wanna know what those Indians are up to.
The old man told 'em to move out.
- For good?
- Huh. He must've been shot in the head, not the leg.
Well, come on.
Let's load up and git.
Just a minute.
Before we talk about loadin', there's one thing I wanna get straight.
- What about our deal with the old man?
- Well, what about it?
There's a fortune in there- enough for everybody...
includin' the old man and the girl.
Now it comes.
Up to last night, I figured the same way you fellas did.
I was just tryin' to save us a lot of trouble when I said we'd split 50-50.
If it hadn't been for them Apaches
comin' in, maybe I'd still feel the same.
But the old man played it square, stuck to his bargain.
If it hadn't been for that, we'd all be layin' around here dead right now.
Whether you like it or not,
we're givin' 'em their full share.
If that don't suit you, you've got a fight on your hands and you better get at it quick.
It's a free country, ain't it?
Majority rules. I say we take a vote on it.
I told you once before.
I don't like votes.
We busted our backs diggin' this stuff out, boss.
We've been scared off by Indians,
shot at by an old desert rat...
- and that he-girl of his.
- Throw down your guns.
It's five to one.
Nobody's anxious to see you dead,
Stretch, but we want that gold... and we want all of it.
There's plenty more left here. If that girl
and the old man want it, they can dig for it.
I've waited all my life to make a killing like this... and I'm not giving half my share to anybody.
Give up now, and we'll call it quits!
You better do like he says, 'cause we're gonna play billiards with you... till we run you out of them rocks.
Then we're gonna pick you off
like a turkey.
Fan out! We gotta flank him.
- But I don't think-
- Who cares what you think?
You're in this now whether you like it or not.
Come on! I'll keep you covered!
- What are you doin' runnin' around here?
- You're hurt.
Get down!
Can you make it to the house?
- I gotta get their horses.
- Horses are already in the barn.
- Well, we had him.
- That fool girl.
Almost filled us full of holes with that buffalo gun of hers.
Come on! Let's go back and load up and get out of here.
And spend the rest of your days... waiting for Stretch to stick a gun in your back?
Not me. I'm not leavin' till we get him.
I wanna sleep nights.
What happened?
Oh, me and the boys had a little... argument.
About our deal?
Couldn't see it your way, eh?
Huh. We figured that was it.
Grandpa!
You shouldn't get out of bed.
Aw, a lot healthier down here.
Here.
Thanks.
What'll they do next?
It's hard to say with me not there to tell 'em.
You've got yourself quite a granddaughter, mister.
I know that.
It's her future that's worrying me.
Yeah.
Mighty quiet out there.
Shh!
- Means they're leavin'.
- Might... if Dude's got anything to say about it.
He's gold crazy.
Can't tell about Lengthy.
He's got other things on his mind.
You, Walrus, Bull Run- cover the back door.
I told Half Pint to take the front door soon as he gets back.
I'll cover the window.
If he comes out...
- let him have it.
- Wait a minute.
Before anybody starts giving orders around here, let's get one thing settled.
I got first call on that girl, understand?
- Ah, who cares about her?
- I do.
All right.
Go ahead and take her.
All I want is that gold.
Come on. Let's go.
Stretch!
You listening?
We know that if we try to blast you out,
some of us are gonna get hurt.
On the other hand, if we run off with the gold and leave you still alive...
we've got sense enough to know that
you'll keep looking until you find us.
So we've decided
to do what you wanted-
split with the old man and the girl.
Course it's not exactly
what we'd like to do... but you can't have everything.
What do you say?
Get in back!
I'm gonna open the door.
That suits me! Come on in!
Did you get him?
Yeah, I'm sure we did.
I saw him fall.
Why, you dirty-
Hey, lady! Lady!
It's me- Walrus.
I got Bull Run with me.
He's bleedin' somethin' awful.
This ain't no trick, ma'am.
I got it in the belly.
Looks like the kid's done for.
Let him in.
Bring him in!
There you are.
- We thought you was dead.
- Well, you was wrong.
I hurt, Stretch.
I was kind of wantin' to get back to see my folks...
but I hurt, Stretch.
Can't just let him lie there and die.
There ain't nothin' you can do for him now, ma'am.
Funny thing.
He was the only one against comin' here in the first place.
What are they gonna try next?
Guess they ain't gonna try nothin' but... get each other and winner take all.
Where are they now?
Dude took a shot at Lengthy, tried to get him in the back of the head... just when he thought he'd got you.
Then he let out for town,
Lengthy after him.
Guess they didn't figure
I was worth botherin' about.
- Where are the horses?
- Down at the saloon, where we left the gold.
- Half Pint's coverin' the front door.
- Tell him to get in here.
Hey, Half Pint!
Dude and Lengthy run off!
Ain't either of them aimin' to share that gold with nobody.
Me and Bull Run is... in here.
Keep your hands up and come on in.
Get over there on the floor.
- Where you goin', boss?
- Where do you think?
Now, you stay here, Mike.
Go on.
Grandpa!
Grandpa! Grandpa!
Come on. Raise your hands.
It's all there, every cent we took.
Let me have that. No, no.
Not that. The hat.
How much you pay for that?
- That doesn't matter. You can have it.
- How much did you pay for it?
Four dollars.
Oh, uh, thanks.
And he has my hat.
Here they come, Grandpa.
Whoa. Whoa.
- Well?
- We did it.
So help me.
It hurt, but we did it.
I paid for it.
You are looking at Superstition Mountain.
A barbaric pile of rock,
40 miles long by 20 wide.
The man is Floyd Buckley.
He's going into this 800 square miles of sudden and violent death... because he thinks it's just another mountain... and because he's greedy for its treasure.
Yeah, I said treasure. Gold.
$20 million worth of precious yellow metal... waiting to be found in America's most elusive mine... appropriately named "The Lost Dutchman".
It's simple to get to. The mountain, I mean.
Just drive 36 miles due east from Phoenix, Arizona, and there she is.
She looks easy from the outside.
Inside, it's like Satan's private art gallery.
Sculptured pagan granites, unmellowed by time... hidden in terrifying canyons and gorges.
But if you'd like to pick up $20 million... and figure, like Buckley there, that a mountain's just a mountain...
I'll show you where to look.
But before you leave for Arizona... you ought to know that 21 men have been murdered grabbing for that dough... and hundreds more have died in other ways.
You see, this is the true story of Superstition Mountain.
The biography of a death trap.
My name's Barry Storm.
I was hurled into this story when I heard that shot.
Up till then, I was just an ordinary guy with a reasonable curiosity... about the Lost Dutchman Mine.
A curiosity I wish I'd never been born with.
I hurried towards the sound of the report... and hoped I'd find a hunter who'd maybe bagged a deer.
I found Floyd Buckley, sprawled and dead.
His blood, life, and dreams spilling out on the unfriendly ground.
When you find a dead man, you're supposed to call the police.
I'm a good citizen.
I set out to do what you're supposed to do.
Fear and panic gave me a boost up over that ledge... and I began to run, not walk, to the nearest exit.
Speed no longer meant anything to Buckley, but it did to me.
I didn't want to be framed in the crosshairs of a telescopic sight... on a high-powered rifle.
I'd just gone in to look for gold.
I didn't want to find lead from the business end of a killer's gun.
It took me three days and 36 miles of tough hiking... to put the sheriff from Florence, Arizona into action.
Identification bracelet.
Wallet.
Telegram.
"Lecturing in Los Angeles, September 30th."
They're going to have to get a new speaker.
That's all the personal effects.
Let's go.
Sit down, son.
You say your name's Barry Storm.
You're from Colorado and you've been here only 10 days.
You're no prospector, but you were up there when Buckley got shot.
What were you doing in the mountain?
I know it sounds kind of bad, but I was following Buckley.
You were what?
Now, wait a minute. I didn't shoot him.
I had a good reason to be up there.
My grandfather was Jacob Walz.
- Who?
- Jacob Walz.
The man who owned the Lost Dutchman Gold Mine.
The Dutchman, huh?
That goes back to about 1880.
He's supposed to have killed quite a few men in his time.
That doesn't have anything to do with me.
All I know is, when I was a kid... my mum heard about this mine her father was supposed to have found.
I always figured someday I'd come down here.
So you came down here. Go on.
I thought there might still be a buck laying around that had my name on it.
The first place I went to was the Claims Office in Phoenix.
- How do you spell that again?
- Walz. W-A-L-Z. Jacob Walz.
Nope. Nobody by that name ever registered a claim here.
This record goes clear back to 1870.
But there must have been.
The Lost Dutchman was supposed to be worth a fortune.
He wouldn't leave the money laying around.
Maybe he never found a mine.
Some people don't believe there ever was a Lost Dutchman.
Well, then again, some do.
The news had a story on it just this morning.
There.
This newspaper item was my first lead.
I wanted to meet this guy who said he was going to find my grandfather's mine.
Mr. Buckley, ask you a couple of questions about this newspaper story.
- Certainly. I'm always glad to see the press.
- I'm not a reporter.
I'm just interested in you being so sure about locating that Lost Dutchman.
If you read my books, you'd know
I wouldn't go on a wild-goose chase.
- You've got a map?
- Naturally I have a map.
- One of the original Peraltas, in fact.
- Peralta?
The Peralta mine I'm seeking and the Lost Dutchman are one and the same.
Then it looks like you and I have got something in common.
- Yes?
- I happen to be Jacob Walz's grandson.
Really? You mean the man who allegedly owned it?
That's very interesting, I'm sure.
- I never knew he left a family.
- I can prove it if I have to.
That's why it might be good business to let me come along with you.
If you know how to use this map...
I not only know how to use it, but I know where the marker is.
And I know how to use that, too.
But for your information, young man,
I never go partners.
Excuse me.
He really brushed me off.
I decided right then to follow him.
When his car dropped him off at Apache Junction, I was waiting.
I started tailing him then.
But Buckley was too sharp.
He lost me on the third day.
I never caught up with him again.
- Not till after I heard the shots.
- 30-30. Entered downward, from behind.
This must be the map he was talking about. It was in his wallet.
- Something's been torn off the top of it.
- Maybe that's the way he got it.
Maybe it had directions on it and he tore it off himself.
Some fellows memorize directions so that nobody else can use their maps.
Why, half the state has got indigestion from eating old maps.
You been staying in Phoenix?
- Your things there?
- Well, some of them.
Most everything I own is right on me.
I put my bag in the bus depot after I checked out of the hotel.
You haven't got a job.
You say you're the Dutchman's grandson.
You tail a guy you thought was holding out on you. He gets knocked off.
Ray, you'd better take him out to the mountain tomorrow.
Let him show you just how he spent those three days.
Walter, you'd better go along with them.
How long after the shot before you found him?
Ten to fifteen minutes.
Maybe longer. He was still warm.
- You didn't see anybody else?
- No.
What were your plans if Buckley had found the mine?
Well, I don't know exactly.
But I wouldn't have shot him.
Well, I guess I didn't have any plans.
That is, beyond hoping there might be a mine I might have some legal rights to.
Come on, Walter.
Let's have a look at the other side of the canyon.
What are you looking for now?
Buckley was hit from behind.
The killer was somewhere up there by that cliff.
You were up over there.
Does that take me off the hook?
Maybe. Unless Buckley spun around before he fell.
You see, three other guys have been knocked off in this same area... ahead of Buckley, before you even got here.
That's a break in your favour.
Buckley was the fourth?
The fourth in the last two years.
All right around here and all by a 30-30.
And if you look in the record book... you'll find out 20 men have died in this mountain since 1880.
Well, I'm through. Let's get back to Apache Junction and some cold beer.
I was just thinking, this all adds up to something.
- Like what?
- Four guys murdered, all in the same area... all by a 30-30, all in the shadow of Weaver's Needle.
So?
The killer thinks he knows where the gold is.
When it looked like the others might find it before he did... when they got too close, he knocked them off.
So the jackpot must be somewhere close.
Near that peak.
Buckley, I bet he found it.
- Found what? The mine?
- No, the marker.
He said he knew where the marker was and how to use it.
Come on. I'll show you something.
There's your marker.
- This is what Buckley meant?
- It's the only marker in this mountain.
The rocks hammered in that old saguaro cactus indicate three directions... but only the one pointing north leads anywhere, though... to some signs carved in those rocks up there.
It's quite a climb. Come on.
There they are.
What do they mean?
Oro is the word for gold.
The sunburst means the mine is near.
Now, this means 50 yards away in the direction the snake is pointing.
Now, the only trouble is, nobody has ever been able to find anything... by following those signs.
- Aren't they the real thing?
- Who knows?
Who put them there?
You suppose my grandfather?
No, they're Spanish signs.
Supposed to have been cut by the Peraltas.
Peraltas. Buckley had a Peralta map.
- Had the name "Manuel" on it.
- There were three of them.
Brothers. Manuel, Pedro, and Ramon.
They were the first to find gold in here
100 years ago.
There's an old Indian legend about them and this mountain, eh, Walter?
They opened up several of the mines and then left.
And then Pedro, the oldest brother, came back with a big expedition.
Walter, here, who's an Apache himself, has heard from his own people... the story of what happened.
After many nuisance raids by the Indians...
Pedro Peralta decided to hide his gold.
He selected the richest and most inaccessible mine of all... as his storage place.
It was reached through a narrow, twisted, and almost hidden canyon... that finally opened onto a torturous runway.
This runway was the only entrance to and the only exit from... the fabulous mine, located on the thin precipitous ledge below.
While armed men stood guard...
Pedro's miners led their animals to the dangerous ledge... where the rough ore was separated from that which had been crushed... and the pure gold nuggets were hurriedly poured into sacks... for storage in the hidden mine.
Pedro sat just inside his mine... and noted that he possessed some $20 million worth of gold.
But fate had decreed a different kind of fortune for him.
Fate, and the Apaches.
Cochise, the greatest of all Apache chiefs... watched the lightning-like attack.
And when every Spaniard was finally killed... he ordered his warriors to close the mine.
You see, the Spaniards had defiled a holy place... when they came into Superstition... because to the Apaches it was the sacred home of their Thunder Gods.
It wasn't enough to just kill Pedro and his men.
All traces of them and their work had to be erased.
So the mine was completely closed and hidden.
With that accomplished,
Cochise and the Apaches... felt their Thunder Gods were avenged and appeased.
Every mine was closed... so efficiently that they disappeared from view as though they had never existed.
And Pedro's $20 million worth of gold... was buried inside the sacred mountain from which it had been taken.
That's the legend... as the Apaches have told it for over 100 years.
- The Apaches buried all that gold?
- Just like in Fort Knox.
Didn't the other brothers, Ramon or Manuel, ever come back?
Well, they say Ramon came back, but who knows?
You know, I generally charge tourists $10 for telling that yarn.
The mine, where the gold is buried, that's the one my grandfather rediscovered?
So they say. Let's push it along.
- Ray, wait a minute.
- Yeah?
Do I have to go out with you?
I'd like to stay in here a while longer.
Getting you, too? Gold-happy.
You know every tourist I tell that yarn to has to stay in a little while longer.
- All trying to figure out them signs.
- I'm something more than a tourist.
I've got a family interest in that mine.
Well, it's all right with me.
I'll leave you some grub.
But, remember, there's a killer loose in here.
I'd hate to see you end up like Buckley.
Covin's reminder about Buckley... took some of the excitement out of me, but only for a minute.
The Deputy could think I was a fool if he wanted to... but I was determined to try my luck at putting the golden jigsaw together.
For the next five days I beat my brains out... trying to make the Spanish treasure signs pay off.
Fifty yards, they said.
I went 50 yards in every direction but straight up.
If I'd had wings, I'd have tried that.
I began to realise that this was no ordinary puzzle.
I finally thought that maybe if I went over every foot of the area... where the four men had been murdered,
I might find something.
How close I came
I didn't learn till a lot later.
I didn't know I was being stalked... that for a moment I was a bull's eye, a sitting duck.
Number five on the list.
I just kept going, dreaming about being a millionaire.
The only thing I learnt was that the guy who'd murdered Buckley... wasn't the only killer loose in Superstition.
You don't relax right away.
You sort of coast to a stop after a shock like that.
I was almost afraid to look at my leg.
I was sure he'd gotten me.
He hadn't, but he came awful close.
I finally started to breathe again and shook off the shroud of fear... the rattler had thrown over me.
I picked up my pack and started to get up.
That's when I found it buried in the ground.
When I pulled rocks loose to throw at the snake...
I'd uncovered a part of a rifle.
Excitedly, I dug the rest of it out of the gravel.
I didn't have any idea what kind it was, but as I held it in my hands...
I wanted to believe it had been my grandfather's.
Because if it was, it could mean
I was close to the lost mine.
To the gold.
Call it fate, luck, it doesn't matter.
But a rattlesnake that had tried to kill me had led me to this old weapon.
At that moment it seemed I could actually feel the presence of Jacob Walz... in the unfriendly canyon.
Suddenly it was more important to find out about this gun... than to keep on searching for the mine.
So I decided to leave the mountain and bring the gun to you.
- Would you know what kind it is?
- Looks like a Sharps.
- But we're interested in a 30-30.
- Yeah.
But if it is old enough, it could have been my grandfather's, couldn't it?
- I told you he had the bug.
- Let me see it.
I think I got a Sharps here.
A Sharps. A breech-Ioader.
Forty-five-ninety calibre. Lots of 'em around here in the '70s and '80s.
That one killed a sheriff in 1875.
You know, finding this where I did,
I thought I might be near his mine.
That is, if it was his gun.
I never heard anybody say what kind of a weapon Walz used.
If it's so important for you to find out, you might try the Pioneer's Home.
- The Pioneer's Home?
- It's in Phoenix. Old folks' place.
One of those old-timers might be able to tell you about this... and your grandfather, too.
They got nothing else to do up there but talk.
Thanks. I think I'll pay them a visit.
Mrs. Bannister might be able to help you.
She spent her childhood in Florence Junction.
She isn't easy to talk to.
If you'll promise not to upset her...
I won't.
Martha, this is Mr. Storm.
He wants to ask you a few questions.
You know I don't like being bothered.
You've got no right to bring people pestering me.
It's about my grandfather.
He lived here around 1886.
I knew a lot of people who lived here.
What was his name?
Walz. Jacob Walz.
I won't talk about him.
Jacob Walz was a mean, wicked man.
And if you're his grandson, you're probably just like him.
Did I hear you mention Jake Walz?
He was a real sidewinder, that man.
What do you want to know about him?
I'll be glad to tell you.
You're always poking your nose in where you ain't wanted, Bill Bates.
- He didn't ask you.
- My name's Barry Storm.
- You see, Walz was my...
- Checking up on old Jake?
Well, you've come to the right place, young fellow.
- Now, if you want my opinion, l...
- He don't want anything from you.
I'm the one who knows all about Jacob Walz.
I found this gun and...
You like guns, don't you?
You probably go around scaring people with them, just like he did to me.
When I was a girl in Florence Junction, he frightened me.
What you doing, mister?
What you doing?
Why are you playing with that?
Is that gun yours? It's brand new, ain't it?
- Ain't it, mister?
- Come here.
Want to have some fun?
Put your finger in there.
Pull.
Pull harder.
I got buyers for two of our burros.
A Mexican fellow and his partner.
Well, here's your burros.
You got them at a good price, too.
Gonna have a look for that lost Spanish gold?
I guessed right, didn't I?
Everybody looks for it, but nobody ever finds it.
I figure them Indians hid it.
Too good, they hid it.
- What do you mean the Indians hid it?
- That gold is hid forever.
Want to sell back them burros?
I'll give you half what you paid for them.
Well, maybe they ain't hid it good enough. Eh, Peralta?
Silencio!
Keep your mouth shut.
Name of Peralta mean anything to you, Dutchie?
Be a dirty shame if they was to stumble onto something... and we wasn't there to see what is was.
Yeah.
- They're making camp for the night.
- Yeah, it's about time.
The fellows must be part mountain goat, the way they been hightailing it.
Go start a fire down in the gully there, and don't make any smoke.
I'll go unload the burro.
Soon as I play myself a game.
You know, I think you're right about them.
They haven't even stopped to pan one of the streams.
- They know where they're going all right.
- Sure they know where they're going.
You should've seen the way that Mexican jumped down the other fellow's throat... when he started to talk.
You're dang right they know where they're going.
Say, you're lucky I let you in on this.
You go down and build a fire and don't make any smoke.
Just turn up the ace of spades and I can win this game.
Well, it could be the ace of spades.
I won that game.
Them's the settin'est two fellows
I ever seen.
Suppose they sleep setting up that way?
Their fire's going out.
Darn ace of spades never shows up when I need it most.
Beats me every dang game.
Come on!
They tricked us, them shad-bellied hornswogglers!
Made us think they was setting here.
- They won't get away.
- We can pick up a trail.
I figure they went this way.
What do you think?
- Why, sure, Dutchie.
- All right, go get the burro. Go on!
The two who were following us...
I wonder if they follow our trail?
No, we'd have seen them two days before if they had.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
I found the marker and the signs.
We won't have long to wait for the next sign now.
See, the moon is just rising.
I never heard of finding a mine by the light of the moon.
It is 38 years to the day that my brothers and I were here.
You won't forget our agreement?
I am a Mexican.
- I cannot file a claim for this mine.
- No, I won't forget.
I file the claim as an American citizen, and we go 50-50.
We must get to the ledge below.
There's nothing here.
It's been many years, but I'm sure this is the place.
Maybe the old burro-seller's right.
Maybe the Indians did cover it up.
We dig here.
My old legs are killing me.
I'm getting too old to be traipsing around these mountains.
When we go back, lets go to Phoenix instead by way of Florence Junction.
What do you say, Dutchie?
You never been to Phoenix, have you?
It's a real live town.
I remember once I was...
Look at it! Gold! Sacks of it, already mined!
We've got a storehouse.
I tell you it's the richest gold ore you ever seen.
Come on.
Gold!
Joe, what is it?
Fellow found gold in Superstition,
Mrs. Thomas.
Brung back nuggets as big as your fist.
- What's happening?
- Parsons is weighing it now.
- Stranger, you've hit it rich.
- How much?
- For that ore, I'd say close to $40,000 a ton.
- $40,000 a ton.
- That's bigger than the California strike.
- How much?
$40,000 a ton!
- Bonanza!
- $40,000 a ton.
- Can you imagine?
- Go and buy up every burro in town. Hurry.
- How much?
- It's over $40,000.
- It's way over $40,000.
- Nearly $50,000.
- How much for what I brought in?
- A mite less than 300 pounds.
- I'll give you $5,000 for it.
- It's worth $6,000.
Refined, maybe. As it is, no.
- Let's see.
- Stop crowding me, will you?
All right, $5,000.
What's your name?
I have to have your name on this receipt.
- Walz. Jacob Walz.
- What's his name?
He said his name was Jacob Walz.
- Who is he?
- Jacob Walz.
- Must be a Dutchman.
- Or a German.
Yeah, that's what I said, a Dutchman.
Jacob Walz.
Sign it.
It's a receipt stating I paid you $5,000... for 297.5 pounds of gold ore.
- You ain't paid me yet.
- I will.
You've got to sign it. It's the law.
Is he signing his name?
- I don't know.
- He isn't even signing his name.
- He can't even write his own name.
- He can't read nor write.
How do you like that, Julia?
A stupid foreigner that can't even read or write finds $1 million gold mine.
And you get $11 a week clerking in a hardware store.
You and your high-school diploma.
And ten 50s make $5,000.
You're sure going to file a claim, ain't you?
I'd like to talk to you about a deal you might find interesting.
Whereabouts is this strike?
Ain't you going to file a claim, mister?
Boy, you really struck it rich.
I'll bet that ore is worth more than Parsons said.
- That gold has got...
- He got $5,000...
Pete.
Pete, where are you?
Get off my bed.
How many times must I tell you to stay out of my room, unless you're invited?
I've got a right to lie on your bed.
I'm your husband.
Come into the other room.
I want to talk to you.
Talk to me in here.
Julia!
That's right, Pete. Come in.
All right. What do you want?
Sit down.
A man named Jacob Walz has just arrived in town.
- I want to meet him.
- Why?
He's discovered gold.
What do you want to meet him for?
I've got a right to know.
Really?
Well, I have a right to some things, too.
Like being sick and tired of running a bakery.
- Wait a minute.
- You've had four years to get me out of here.
- I've had bad luck. I'm doing the best I can.
- Yes, you've done very well.
Have you been able to keep a job?
Have you replaced our savings... you so cleverly invested in grazing land no animal could live on? Have you, Pete?
- That wasn't my fault. I got swindled.
- No, I got swindled.
So now, you're going to bring that man here.
- No, I won't, Julia.
- Yes, you will.
There's still that unsolved murder in Milwaukee.
- All right.
- Good.
Of course, he's not to know that I'm married to you.
- But you are married to me.
- Yes, but he's not to know.
You understand, Pete?
- What do you want of him?
- I'm not sure yet.
But I am sure I'm not going to stay here and dry up... like the other women in this filthy town.
I'll get a job driving the stage to Tucson or mining up in Gold Field.
Yes. He's at Luke's Saloon now.
Buy him drinks or whatever he wants.
Just see that I meet him, Pete.
Pete?
There's some money on the floor.
He's been here close to eight hours.
How long can he go on?
- Come on, Walz. Tell us where the...
- No!
Very good, how about buying you a drink, mister?
I buy my own drinks.
I could buy the whole place if I wanted to.
Where'd you strike it rich, Dutchie?
Come on, tell us.
- You want to hear about the mine?
- Is there much of this high-grade ore, Walz?
That? That's nothing.
Why, that's just some of the loose stuff
I picked up on the outside of the mine.
You mean on the outside?
On the inside of the mine, there's a vein of gold as thick as...
- As thick as her waist.
- Where is it? Come on, tell us.
All right, I'll tell you.
From the mine, you can see the old military trail.
- Yeah?
- Then, it is in Superstition?
But from the trail, you can't see the mine.
You've been teasing and horsing us around all night, Walz.
Now, you tell us where you struck it rich or shut up.
- Put up or shut up.
- That's telling him.
- It's about time somebody told him off.
- The blowhard.
- Maybe I'll file a claim.
- What?
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
You'd know right where to look.
That'd make it easy for you.
Well, come on up and try to find it.
And I'll be waiting for you.
I'll give you a real welcome.
That's telling them, Walz.
How about buying you a drink?
He told you before, he can buy his own drinks. Come on, honey.
Are you really a Dutchman, honey?
I bet Elsie you was a German. Was I right?
What, honey?
Bring me a drink.
Had enough of that Dutchman tonight.
I bet you get awful Ionesome up in the mountains all alone.
It ain't natural for a man to be by himself all the time, honey.
When you go back to your mine, maybe you ought to take a little company.
Maybe like taking Lucille with you?
You're just like the rest. All you want is my gold. That's all any of you want!
I don't want none of your gold, mister.
Not tonight.
- Get out of my place!
- You dirty...
Stop it, Lucille. You heard me, get out.
All right. You won't let me stay in... and I won't let you come out.
He's bluffing.
Relax, boss, another half minute, he'll fall on his face.
Get out of here, you drunken...
Take it easy.
Come on, Jim. Let's get him.
- Where'd he get to?
- Where'd he go?
- He disappeared, Julia.
- Not so loud, Pete.
- I tried to bring him home.
- He's inside now.
Unconscious, passed out here on the street.
Now, please don't come back until I send for you.
- Julia.
- Please.
Good night, Pete.
Well, at last. Good morning.
How do you feel now?
Here's some coffee. Fresh roll.
You may wash up in there.
- How'd I get here?
- You were lying in the doorway of my shop.
- You were quite sick.
- I was drunk last night.
- Either way, I still couldn't leave you there.
- Why?
- Why?
- Yeah.
Because I felt sorry for you.
What other reasons are there?
- How much do I owe you?
- Owe me?
- Yeah, here.
- Why, nothing.
Very glad you're feeling better now.
My name is Jacob Walz.
I'm glad to know you, Mr. Walz.
I'm Julia Thomas.
- You do not know who I am?
- No, should I?
Everybody in town's talking about me.
- Why?
- I found a bonanza.
- What?
- Gold.
I found the richest gold mine in the world.
That's nice.
Would you like some more coffee?
- You have no interest?
- Should I have?
Mr. Walz, I don't know anything about gold mines.
I just know about baking, and trying to run my little shop.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I do have to get the baking done.
You don't even want to know where my mine is.
I wouldn't know a gold mine if I fell into one.
- I'm very much obliged to you.
- You're welcome.
May I call upon you sometime?
- Well, l...
- This evening?
All right, if you wish.
Excuse me.
- Good morning, Mrs. Butler.
- How much are them?
- 20 cents a dozen.
- That's outrageous.
- And them?
- The same.
You ought to be ashamed charging such prices.
- But they're the lowest in town.
- Ever since that gold strike... everybody's charging four times what things is worth, and you ain't no different.
Criminals, all of you.
Give me half a dozen of them.
- Very well.
- The freshest ones, mind you.
- All this stuff's been sold.
- What?
- It belongs to me.
- Why, you can't do...
- And you get out.
- You can't talk to...
- You get out!
- I won't stand it!
You get out and you stay out!
Herr Walz, you shouldn't have done that.
She was one of my best customers.
You let people talk to you that way?
When a woman has to support herself... it's necessary to endure many unpleasant things.
I buy everything.
- Really, there's nothing...
- It's for sale?
- Yes, but...
- All right, I buy everything.
You wrap it up. I take it with me.
- Everything?
- Here.
- Hey, you like cookies?
- Yes, sir.
Here.
- All of them?
- Yeah.
Good evening.
- Gum drops.
- Thank you. How nice.
Won't you come in?
Please. Won't you sit down?
I'm much obliged to you for taking me in last night.
It was nothing at all.
I'm much obliged to you.
- Why?
- For the biggest day's business I've had... since I came to Phoenix. I've sold out.
- Would you like to see the album?
- Yes, I would.
This is my mother, my father.
He died when I was seven.
That was after they came from Germany.
- Oh, dear. Not that one.
- Here, wait a minute.
I keep meaning to take it out of there.
It's so embarrassing.
You grew up fine.
Let me see.
I was born and raised in Milwaukee.
This is the house we lived in.
And this is my mother's uncle.
He's in Dresden now.
- And this is...
- When did you come here?
About four years ago.
Why did you come here?
After my mother passed away,
I just didn't want to stay there anymore.
I thought this was as good a place as any for a woman to make her own way.
Now, this is...
- Herr Walz, do you like music?
- Who doesn't like music?
Herr Walz.
- I'm sorry.
- Good night.
Please.
I didn't want to make you angry.
It was just that you are so very beautiful.
Good night, Herr Walz.
Don't assume you can take liberties... simply because
I'm a businesswoman living alone.
- May I call upon you again?
- Good night.
- You may use this door.
- Please, may I call upon you again?
Tomorrow?
All right.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Good night, Fräulein.
That's her husband sitting over there.
You think that Dutchman would've found out about him by now.
Walz doesn't even know she's married.
Folks are scared to tell him.
Walz would shoot your head off, if you said anything.
How many trips has Walz made to that mine since he met her?
Five. Maybe six.
Next.
How long will it be?
Let me see. I've got this gentleman here.
He can have my place.
What's so funny?
- Give me a shave.
- Yes, sir.
Just got back into town?
Only been gone five days.
Who is that fellow?
Him?
He's the fellow that gave you his place.
Pete, what are you doing here?
I told you not to come back unless I sent for you.
Everybody in town knows what's going on but him.
- And they're laughing at me.
- Stop acting like a child.
- Why'd I do it?
- Do what?
Get up and run out of that barbershop like a scared rabbit.
And all the time I wanted to...
- What are you so dressed up for?
- He said he'd be back today.
And I don't want him to find you here.
You've seen him nine or 10 times.
How long will this go on?
- What difference does it make?
- Julia, don't see him anymore.
- You're a fool.
- You're the smart one.
Only not as smart as you thought you were.
Not smart enough to get any of his money or to find out where his mine is.
I know what I'm doing.
He'll be here any minute.
Have you told him yet?
Have you told him you're married... that you're somebody else's wife?
- Pete, I want you to leave.
- Somebody will tell him.
Maybe somebody in the barbershop already told him.
He'll find out.
He'll find out you're after the same thing everybody else is after.
Get out.
I won't stand for you fooling around with that Dutchman.
Let go of me. You're mussing my dress.
Let loose of me.
I'll send for you when I want you.
That's him.
Go out the back door. Go on.
This is it.
He pays off tonight, or it's the last night.
And when I come back it'll be through the front door, Julia.
Jacob.
Every time I see you, you are more beautiful.
All the way to and from the mine...
I keep practicing pretty speeches to say to you.
When I see you, I forget them.
Do people talk to you about me, about us?
- No one would dare. Why?
- There's something I must tell you.
What is it?
I should have told you a long time ago, but I never thought it would be necessary.
I'm married. I have been for five years.
I couldn't lie to you, not now.
I don't love my husband.
Now I know I never have.
All I want is to be free of him.
- You don't care for him?
- No. I love you, Jacob.
- What's his name?
- Pete Thomas.
- Will he give you a divorce?
- Divorce?
For money. Will he give you a divorce?
I don't know.
Here's $2,000. We'll set a limit, say $5,000.
Will that be enough for him?
Perhaps.
But he must sign a paper giving you a divorce.
I know about these things.
I was married once myself.
My wife divorced me, took my daughter away from me... all because my wife didn't sign a paper.
So he must sign that paper before he gets a penny of money.
Will you make the arrangements?
- No, I'll do it myself.
- No, Jacob. I know I can.
Good. When did he get back?
Tonight.
What is it, Jacob?
I'm going back to the mine tonight to get more money for us.
I love you.
I love you, Julia, and I want to marry you.
Soon, there will be just you and I.
Yes, Jacob. Just you and I.
Hey, everybody, I just saw the Dutchman.
He woke up old man Parsons.
Made him open up his store to get his grub.
I saw him head for the corral.
He's on his way back to the mine.
I don't know. Go after him.
Give me a drink, one for the road.
You and your big mouth, you wreck our business.
We got to find that mine.
Come on. Wake up.
What is it?
- I want you to get my burros ready.
- It's you.
What for? You just got back.
It ain't decent waking a man in the middle of the night.
- Not for burros.
- Do you know a Pete Thomas?
I ain't no gossip. I mind my own business.
I didn't ask you for any gossip.
I asked you if you knew him.
We say howdy when we meet.
I haven't seen him much lately.
He ain't used no animals for a spell.
- How long has he been here?
- I don't know. Three or four years.
Ever since him and his wife came here from Milwaukee.
I'll start rounding up them dang burros for you now.
I don't see why you can't wait until morning, though.
Where did he go?
Must be getting old.
I can't seem to remembering him going.
Corral, I guess.
It's safe to go home now.
The Dutchman's gone.
Did you have a nice evening?
Did he pay off, or do you have to see him just once more?
I'm glad you're back.
He gave me this. $2,000 and there'll be more.
This is for you, Pete, and the rest is coming.
- More than that if you want it.
- I don't want his money, understand?
- Let go of me and listen.
- No, you listen to me for a change.
You're through with him, and this time I'll make sure of it.
What do you mean?
When he comes back from the mine he'll find me here, where I belong.
I'll tell him how you played him for a sucker.
You're like the rest, only worse.
You pretend to be decent.
I'll tell him the whole rotten story, from beginning to end.
The whole story, Pete?
Yes, including the murder.
It won't matter if you turn me in.
It won't matter at all... because when I'm through with him
I'll have a second one to my credit...
Jacob Walz.
- You've got to listen to me.
- Try to buy me off, would he?
He can't do it.
Wait a minute. Whose idea was this?
- Did he think it up all by himself?
- No, he didn't.
It was my idea, all mine.
I don't like those kinds of ideas.
I'll kill him before he gets out of town.
Don't be silly.
The only way I could get the money was to tell him you could be bought off.
You're still my wife.
I'm not lying to you.
He thinks you'll give me a divorce for money.
There was no other way of getting it.
Don't you understand?
Could it be that it isn't just his gold you're interested in... that you've been lying to me?
Could that be?
- Don't be a fool.
- Answer me. Are you in love with him?
I've told you over and over again, all I want is his gold.
- For us.
- I don't want anything from him.
Not even his mine?
Once I find out where it is, he'll be no problem to us.
- Julia, you aren't lying to me?
- No.
You really leaving tonight?
The guy said you were on your way back to the mine.
- When you leaving?
- What's the matter, Dutchie?
Come on, Walz. We're friends.
You've had enough now to kill a horse.
Why don't you take your business somewhere else?
Ain't they buying gold in Tucson or other places?
Every time you leave Phoenix, you take half the town with you.
Everybody trying to follow you and find out where that mine is.
I'll bet there's a hundred of our customers waiting... to follow you into that mountain right now.
Take your gold and go to some other town.
You ruin our business coming here.
Get me a pencil and a piece of paper.
There's Weaver's Needle.
There's the runway.
That's the ledge 200 yards from the cactus marker.
- The mine's just below that.
- I see.
- I'm not coming back to Phoenix.
- What?
Too many people following me out of town.
Crowd's getting bigger and it's getting harder to lose on the trail.
We'll meet somewhere else, doesn't matter where.
- But, Jacob, I thought...
- You can get a divorce anywhere.
You can leave your husband the same way my wife left me.
Is there anything wrong with that?
No, only I thought...
Of course, if you didn't mean what you said about us.
If you lied.
Oh, no.
I did mean it, Jacob.
There's no sense giving him any money.
I've thought it over.
Can't I go with you now?
I'd never lose those people on the trail if you were with me.
- You're so strange.
- Will you meet me at the mine or won't you?
Yes, I'll meet you there.
It may take me two or three extra days because of the crowd.
- You'll be there ahead of me.
- Yes, I'll be waiting at the mine for you.
What did he want?
What did he come back for?
Nothing. Just to see me again.
Planning on running out on me, Julia?
No, Pete.
You know I wouldn't go without you.
I do now.
And I know something else.
You're in love with him.
You've been lying to me about that, too.
But we're going to the mine together.
You're going to be there when I kill him.
Do you understand?
Let me see that map again.
There's Weaver's Needle. We're almost there.
And I can hardly wait.
This is it.
This is the runway he told you about.
What if he's here?
He said it would take him two or three extra days.
Anyway, he expects me.
If he is here, you get him out where I can see him.
Jacob.
Pete, come on down. It's all right.
He's not here.
Look at it, Julia, just look at it.
Now I see why he always got back to town so soon.
All he had to do is pick it up.
Pete.
It's worth millions.
Bring the burros down here.
The runway we came down is the only way on or off this ledge.
Go on.
You were so anxious to be ready for him.
You're right.
Julia!
- They're gone. Everything's gone.
- What?
Our supplies, the food, the water, everything. It's gone.
- Maybe the burros just wandered away.
- No, they were tied up.
- He's already here. He knows.
- No.
Call to him. Get him out in the open. Go on.
Jacob, where are you?
I didn't want to bring him. I didn't want to.
Listen to me.
I didn't want to bring him. He made me do it.
Please, darling. Help me.
Quick, before he finds out I'm gone.
You fool.
Get away from me.
All right, what are you waiting for?
Get it over with.
Pete, ask him for water. Go on.
You want her?
Take her. You can have her.
Nobody wants you.
From the beginning, it was her idea.
I don't want your gold. I never did.
If you want her, take her. You can have her.
You see, Jacob, I've gotten rid of him.
I killed him for you.
Now you know I wasn't lying to you.
It's all over.
It's just you and me now, remember?
Just like you wanted it.
You love me. You said you did.
We can be married now, just like you said.
I wasn't lying to you, Jacob.
He forced me to bring him with me.
I didn't want to.
You've got to believe me. You've got to.
I proved I loved you when I killed him.
Please help me.
I want you.
All you ever wanted was my gold.
Well, now you've got it.
This record only goes back to 1912.
Arizona didn't become a state till then.
But you got the right dope from those old newspapers.
I remember for a fact it was in 1910... two years before we had a coroner's office.
What are you two talking about?
I'm checking up on a female skeleton found in Superstition.
If Bill Bates was right, that skeleton was Julia Thomas'... the woman my grandfather was in love with.
If you don't stop harping about this Walz business... somebody's going to swear out a lunacy complaint.
But, Ray, I've got a lot to go on now.
First, I found that rifle.
Then I checked the stories of the old folks at the Pioneer's Home.
I even learnt that an earthquake did hit Superstition.
- It was on May 3rd, 1887.
- Who cares?
I'm going back to that canyon where I found that rifle.
So long, fellas.
Might as well clear off one of my tables.
Be just my luck they bring him in on Sunday.
- Did you find your mine yet?
- Nope.
But I'm on my way back to Superstition right now.
You better be careful.
There's still a killer up there.
I got nothing to lose, except my life.
The sky clouded up... and the wind tried to blow a scare into me... as I made my way back to the treasure signs.
Three days later... the clouds got out of the sky and into my brain.
I got lost.
I couldn't even find the canyon where I'd uncovered the old gun.
Like an idiot...
I fumbled in and out of one gorge after another... pushing along with no more sense or reason... than if I had been on a treadmill.
I knew I had to locate the rock called Weaver's Needle... before I could even start looking for the lost mine.
Then, with sheer blind luck
I walked right into it.
Here was the spot I'd found the gun, killed the rattlesnake.
And I had my starting point.
A short distance away I found the cliff... from which I could see the old military trail.
Jacob Walz had said that from his mine he could see the trail... but from the trail nobody could see the mine.
I set out to prove he'd told the truth.
Now, I'm a guy who gets dizzy just standing on a high kerb.
But even when the ground dropped out from under me... like a deceitful friend,
I kept scrambling along the cliff side... keeping the trail in sight.
When you're sick with gold fever you have no patience with caution.
All you think of is getting your hooks into... that glittering pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
I followed the edge of that cliff... staying within view of the trail for the next three days.
My fever began to go down as discouragement set in... and I was about ready to give up and go home, when suddenly...
I came on a wide ledge.
Gradually, it dawned on me that here... the trail was in sight but that a mine couldn't be seen from below.
And then I found the map, the strange map carved in a stone.
This was something I hadn't expected.
I got as excited as a poker player filling an inside straight flush.
They looked like old Spanish markings.
A sort of master map of the region.
But the doodles didn't make any sense, because I didn't know how to read them.
Then I found that hole... and realized it had been drilled into the rock for some reason.
I didn't have any idea what the reason could be... but I picked up a stick and began probing to try and find out.
I peered along the stick... but its direction pointed out nothing
I hadn't seen before.
Then I discovered... though it looked like just a single hole on the outside... there were actually several on the inside.
My second look didn't lead anyplace either.
But the third started bells ringing in my head.
It pointed my eyes at a strange kind of peak... a startling rock formation with a window in its top.
I felt as if Santa Claus had just climbed down my chimney.
I began making tracks for that peak.
As I clawed and climbed my way towards the window above... one thought kept repeating itself.
Nobody, not Ray Covin, the Sheriff,
Bill Bates... nobody had ever mentioned the weird map cut in the rocks... or this peak that had been pointed out by the stick in the hole.
I'd discovered these things all by myself.
What I knew was top secret, private knowledge for Barry Storm.
I felt sure that at last, finally...
I was on the express road to the Lost Dutchman... and my grandfather's fabulous mine... where I'd find lumps of gold piled up like rubble.
I was so dreamy, I figured all I had to do was crawl through that window... and the mine was on the other side.
But there wasn't any mine, there was nothing.
I figured I'd crawled behind another eight-ball.
Then I realized this arch was man-made.
It did add up to something.
And when I saw my shadow on the valley floor...
I knew this window was the key to the gold.
My whole future was in that square of light below.
I raced back to the wall map to fix its location in my mind... then got started on that last lap to fame and fortune.
But something had changed.
It wasn't like I'd left it.
Looking for this?
Ray, what are you doing here?
- Looking for you.
- What for? Ray, I got it.
I found the window cut in the rock.
It's a sort of a light sign.
It casts a shadow that points to a spot where the gold may be buried.
- And the spot is...
- Go on.
Of course, it may not mean anything at all.
- What did you come back for?
- Another murder.
Drop your gun belt.
You shut up fast when you thought you'd found something.
You don't want a partner and neither do I.
You killed Buckley.
I've been looking for that gold for 20 years, Storm.
If anybody's going to get it, it's going to be me.
You're right about that light sign.
And some night it's going to show me where the gold is.
Turn around.
Start walking.
We'll send a posse in after you in a couple of weeks.
No murder here.
Your bones will show you just died of a bad fall.
Keep walking. Right to the end.
Covin makes victim number 21.
Good thing Walter trailed you, or you'd still be explaining this.
Too bad he didn't get up in time to help you.
But why were you having me tailed?
I wasn't. I was after Ray.
It wasn't any accident
I sent Walter with you the first time.
Ray had a funny habit of being out of the office... whenever these murders happened.
And he was always so fast locating the bodies.
I stayed behind that first time after Covin told me to go back.
When I saw him raise his gun about to shoot you, I knew he was the killer.
Then you've been using me for a clay pigeon.
Kind of.
I couldn't arrest my own deputy just on knowing.
I had to prove Covin was the murderer.
That's why I was waiting for you to go in again.
I knew if you got too close, he'd have to make a pass at you.
Well, let's get going.
I want to be out of here before dark.
I'm not going with you.
I got a date up there tonight.
Mind a little company?
Ought to be kind of interesting... watching a man just dig up $20 million.
All I'm waiting for is that full moon.
When it comes through that window... it'll light up the patch of ground where I'm to dig.
That's all I'll need.
Look at it.
I'm standing right in the centre of it.
Right here.
This is where I dig.
My grandfather's gold.
$20 million worth.
It's moved.
It was here, that square light. Now it's there.
You hadn't figured on that, Storm?
You forgot the moon and earth keep moving.
At this rate, you'll have to dig up the whole mountain.
Need a bulldozer.
That earthquake changed things, too.
That's why Ray Covin never found the mine.
That's why you'll never find it.
That's right.
If it is the moon that'll point out that gold, it'll only do it once a year.
On the anniversary of the night the Peraltas made that sign.
That's the catch.
When was that sign made?
What night, what hour, what moment?
If I could figure that out, I'd hit the jackpot.
And if you did, this county would need a new sheriff... because I'd be right there digging with you.
Come on, let's go.
Well, that's the story as far as I'm concerned.
The whole biography of
Superstition Mountain won't be finished... till somebody takes that gold away from her.
The treasure signs, the marker... the light sign, they're all genuine.
Maybe you can figure out that strange map carved in the stone.
I've got a hunch it holds the key to the fortune.
Anyway, everything's all there in the mountain.
And if you're interested... you might like to know that any citizen of the United States... has the legal right to search for gold.
And you don't have to pay anybody for the privilege.
If you should find Superstition's treasure, the State of Arizona... and the Government of the United States will recognise your claim to it.
Like I said at the beginning... if you'd like to pick up $20 million,
I'll show you where to look.
Well, I've shown you.
[ Man ] All right, men,
time to go wolfhuntin'
How's it look?
[ Both Chattering ]
- [ Fiddle ]
- [ Man Singing, Indistinct ]
 This is the song
they sing 
Hey, get along
Get along Josey 
Hey, get along
Jim along Joe 
Hey, get along
Get along Josey 
Hey, get along
Jim along Joe 
Watch your turns.
[ Continues ]
Ladies, bow.
Gents,you know how.
Do-si-do
and around you go.
Sure was nice of you and your father to come over tonight, Miss Webb.
Oh, it was nice of you asking us.
We been intendin'to-- Ma has,
I mean-- to come visiting,
you bein'new folks here.
Well, we've been wishing you would.
[ Skillet Scraping ]
[ Continues ]
Looks like the Kents are merrymaking.
Let's see if we can't help 'em celebrate.
[ Continues ]
[ Caller ]
Oh,yeah.!
- Stop the music.
- [ Music Stops ]
[ Wolf Howling ]
[ Growls ]
That's what we've been told not to do.
Now put that back... and get your mother and the other women and children down into the storm cellar.
- [ People Chattering ]
- Dad, what is it?
- Mr. Webb, would you go to the barn and let the horses out?
- Certainly.
[ All Shouting, indistinct ]
- Ma!
- [ All Talking At Once ]
[ Chattering ]
Be careful now.
Don't--
- [ Ma ] Be careful of those steps.
- What is it?
- it's a raid.
- But why?
- They hate us. We're Mormons.
Go on. Hurry now.
- Mormons?
Hey.! Here's one.!
- Come on out, Mormon.
- Get out here and find out... what the state of illinois thinks of you.
Come on, come on.
- [ Door Slams ]
- [ Footsteps ]
Cut me some firewood.
Has-Has anything like this ever happened before?
Five years ago in Missouri.
Just because you people are Mormons?
Just because we're Mormons.
- [ Crying ]
- No.
[ Gunshot ]
[ Gunshots ] i got one of their Mormon bibles.
Let's make 'em spit on it.
- Make him spit on it.
- Spit on it.
- Stuff it down his throat.
- Go on! Spit on it!
''Blessed be ye when men revile you and say all manner of evil things about you for my sake.''
Don't ''blessed'' us!
Come on out of there!
- Ma, they set the house on fire.
- Oh!
Now hide in the fields until they're gone. Hurry! Quick!
This is what you can expect if you don't clear outta here.
Why are you doing this?
We only want to live in peace with everyone.
[ Grunts ]
[ Ma ]
Oh!
Caleb!
Oh, Caleb.
Dad!
Dad!
[ Crying ]
[ Screams ]
My father, Caleb Kent.
- How?
- Beaten to death.
[ Man ]
Jasper Palmer.
- How?
- Beaten.
Well, what are you gonna do about it, stand back and pray... while they drive us out of another state?
The Lord works in strange ways.
Sure, but that didn't prevent him turning Samson loose... on those Philistines with the jawbone of an ass, did it?
What those fellas need is a little lead in their bellies.
- if you say the word, i'll--
- Tear them limb from limb. i know.
- That's what they're itching for.
- Our people have had enough trouble without that.
They can't stand much more,
Joseph. They can't stand to pull up stakes and move again.
Let's settle this the wise way then.
Give them the political power they want. Vote the way they say to vote.
[ Man ] Yeah.
Let them use that power to destroy us.
The authorities will protect us if we do as they say. i wouldn't trust them any further than i can chuck a mule.
We can't take any more chances, start all over.
We've got the biggest city in illinois to protect.
Promise them anything they want, only let's have peace.
What do you say, Hyrum?
A man has a right to fight for his own life.
And you, Heber?
Seems like we'll have to.
Otherwise they'll drive us clear out of the United States.
All my life, i've asked only one thing of my neighbors-- to be left alone in peace.
We've stuck to that in every state we've been in.
- But i guess it won't work.
- What?
You may be right, Angus, but perhaps it's time... for us to show a different kind of courage... and do something besides be killed for what we believe.
Tell the people i said to arm themselves.
- That's treason.
- That if there's any more raiding... we're going to fight back.
Tell them i'm going to lead them myself. if they haven't got guns, get guns for them.
Tell them we're through turning the other cheek.
Hallelujah!
What's the difference between a white man and a Mormon?
- Blamed if i know.
- About 50 wives.
[ All Laughing ]
[ Man ]
There he is...
the man that says
he talks to God.
A man so eaten
with pride and ambition...
that even the word ''treason''
holds no horror for him.
A prophet and saint who walks up to God... anytime he feels like it, whispers in his ear... and gets talked back to--
Joseph Smith.
Now, gentlemen, you've heard the evidence.
Of all that,
I need say no more.
However... i would hold myself no better than a skunk... if i did not bring up a matter... which is the very heart and core of this case-- to wit, the teachings ofJoseph Smith.
[ All Shouting, indistinct ]
Quiet down!
Quiet! Quiet!
Order!
Go ahead, Pete.
Joseph Smith, a half-educated boy just like you or me... brought up in a two-by-four town called Palmyra... in New York state... has the unmitigated nerve to stand up and say...
God told him to rewrite the Holy Bible... because it's full of errors--
errors, mind you--
and to go out and preach...
that all churches
are an abomination
in the sight of the Lord...
except this one... that God told him personally... to go out and get an army to run.
Give him a trumpet, and i bet he'd say he's Gabriel hisself.
- [ Shouting, indistinct ]
- Oh, wait a minute!
Go on and sit down.
And remember, this is a court of law and justice.
The self-respectin' people of three states--
New York, Ohio and Missouri--
God bless 'em... have already told Joseph Smith to pack up and git.
But has that stopped him?
Oh, no!
He's come all the way here to illinois to save us.
And what does he do?
He buys himself a swamp hole for almost nothing... and builds himself a town called Nauvoo... and sends his missionaries all over the world to tell people...
God set our land aside as their inheritance.
Before long, they'll own every stick and stone in illinois... fill every public office, run every church and school... unless we get rid of them!
Your Honor, the prosecution rests.
[ All Cheering ]
Order in the court!
- [ Crowd Chattering ]
- Has the defense anything further to offer?
Your Honor, if there's no objection, i'd like to say something.
- [ Shouting, indistinct ]
- [ Bell Clanging ] i say we all let him say what he's got to say!
Let yourself go, Brigham.
Your Honor, my name is Brigham Young.
- i'm not a lawyer, but--
- Never mind that. Go ahead, talk.
All right.
Go ahead.
Gentlemen, it looks to me like there's been a little mistake made here.
The lawyer for the other side has been so busy... trying to pin every crime on the calendar on Joseph Smith... he clean forgot to mention that us folks was the victims of all those outrages... he was talking about, not the ones that were doing them.
Sure, we finally got around trying to protect ourselves.
You push even a coyote up in a corner, and he'll snap back at you.
That's the first time
I ever heard it called treason though. in other words, the whole point is... whetherJoseph Smith or any other American citizen... has a right to worship God as he chooses.
So that's why i figured i'd like to tell you a little bit aboutJoseph Smith.
Now, me,
I'm just an ordinary everyday fellow. i used to farm a little, do a little carpentry work... painting-- anything to make a living.
But all that time, i was trying to find the right church... for me and for my family, and i was willing to give them all a try.
But somehow none of them hit me just right. i'm not saying, gentlemen, there was anything wrong with them for other people. i'm just saying they didn't suit me.
One day i picked up
The Book of Mormon...
and I said to my friend
Heber Kimball...
''Heber, let's go out to Ohio and see this prophet.
Let's see what he's got to say for himself.'' i remember it was about noon we came up toJoseph Smith's house... and his wife Emma came to the door. and his wife Emma came to the door.
Excuse me, ma'am, is this whereJoseph Smith lives?
- Yes.
- We'd like to talk to him, please.
You'll find him out yonder, the other side of the lake, chopping wood.
Thank you, ma'am.
That sounds kind of funny for a prophet to be out swinging an ax.
- Don't seem just right.
- Prophet ought to act like a prophet.
Can't expect to build a church if he acts like a farmhand.
Good morning.
How do you do, sir? i'm Brigham Young.
- This is my friend Heber Kimball.
- i'm glad to meet you.
We've come a long ways to see you.
We want to ask you some questions about your church.
Gladly. i'd like to tell you about it.
Won't you sit down?
What's this about you folks calling yourselves saints?
Well, we believe that any man, dead or alive... who keeps the Ten Commandments is a saint.
You don't pretend to be the Lord himself, do you?
No. i'm just a mortal man, same as you or your friend here.
Well, this plan of yours you call the United Order, what's that? it's not my plan. it's the Lord's.
Well, whose ever it is, what is it?
Well, i-- i suppose you'd call it the law of nature.
You see, it's his idea that the land of Zion will be sort of like a beehive... or like that anthill over there... with everybody doing his share of the work... and getting his part of the profits.
Aplace where everybody
will have everything
he can eat and use.
There'll be great storehouses
to keep food and things in...
There'll be great storehouses
to keep food and things in...
for the sick and the poor,
the old folks.
You see, under a brotherhood plan like that... it'll be impossible for any one man to pile up a lot of goods... or have power over his neighbors.
That'll mean there'll be no social distinctions... no caste, no special privileges. any more than, i take it, there is in that anthill over there.
We had it once, but somehow we've all but lost it.
We've got to get back to it again.
Well, that--
That sounds all right.
But then there'll always be lazy people, ambitious people.
There'll be some honest ones and some dishonest ones.
What i'm telling you,
Brother Brigham, is a revelation from the Lord. it's up to us to work it out.
This isn't an easy religion.
Well, i'm not looking for an easy religion. i'm looking for one i can bring my family up decent in.
Joseph.
Dinner is ready.
Won't you stay and have dinner with us?
[ Young ]
Well, thank you. We'd be glad to.
All right.
Come on.
Now, gentlemen, i'm not asking you to believe... a single thing
Joseph Smith said... but i do ask you-- let him believe it.
Let me believe it if we want to.
Your forefathers and mine came to this country in the first place... for one great reason-- to escape persecution for their beliefs... and to build a free country where everybody might worship God as he pleased.
That's what brought the Puritans to Massachusetts... the Quakers to Pennsylvania... the Huguenots to South Carolina, the Catholics to Maryland.
And when they found what they were after... they fought a great war to hold on to it... and they drew up one of the noblest documents ever written-- the Constitution of the United States-- to govern free men.
And the very first words they put on that piece of paper... guarantees to every man... the right to worship God as he pleases... and prohibits Congress or anybody else... from ever doing anything to take away that right.
You can't convict
Joseph Smith just because... he happens to believe something you don't believe.
You can't go against everything your ancestors fought and died for.
And if you do, your names-- notJoseph Smith's-- will go down in history as traitors.
They'll stink in the records... and be a shameful thing on the tongues of your children.
Thank you, sir.
The jury can go out now and decide.

Sheriff, take charge of the prisoner.
- Have him here tomorrow morning at 1 1 :00 for sentence.
- Yes, sir.
-Joseph, if you'll say the word--
- You'll do nothing of the sort.
- i'm going with you,Joseph.
- So am i.
Come on.
Joseph, i'm going too.
This is the end. i want you to stay and take care of my people.
Don't look so solemn,
Brigham.
Only the Lord God of israel can whip us... and i don't think he's in cahoots with the sheriff.

[ Knocking On Door ]
We thought we'd just come over and see how you were getting along.
Won't you come in?
- i'm going away.
- Where to?
You see, i have an aunt back in New York-- not really my aunt, but just by marriage--
- and i wrote her and asked her--
- We came hopin' you'd come over and stay with us.
Oh, thanks just the same, but i-- i'm afraid i couldn't do that.
We'd sure like to have you if you could.
We thought, seeing you lost your father had something to do with us--
- Oh, but i'm not a Mormon.
- That wouldn't make any difference.
But i-- i just don't understand. it's been so terrible, all this hating and killing.
- it won't always be like that, Zina.
- i couldn't stand it. i've just got to get away.
[ Sobbing ]
Oh, well. Now, now.
You come over and stay with us.
[ Crying ] i don't know hardly what to do.
Well, now, you can stay for a little while.
And then a little later, after you're getting to feeling better... then you can decide.
[ Crying ]
[ Rooster Crows ]
[ Hammering ] i'm afraid you folks are making a sad mistake... fixin' to run off and leave a fine farm like this... when there's no sense to it.
Brigham Young thinks there's sense to it. Gettin' ready to leave by spring.
What Brigham Young thinks and what the Lord says are two different things.
Brother Duncan has been picked to takeJoseph's place as prophet.
- Duncan?
- He's had a revelation.
What does Brigham Young say about your being head of the church?
As i told you before, what Brigham Young says and what the Lord says... are two different things.
Everyone knows thatJoseph wanted me to take his place. i was his chief counsel long before Brigham Young ever came along.
- i stood up for him.
- Like Brigham stood up for him in court you mean?
He'd never have been in court in the first place if he hadn't listened to fool advice. i warned him what would happen raising an army instead of compromising.
''Compromising''?
Listen. i stood right here in this yard and saw my father-- who'd never hurt anybody in all his life-- beaten to death...
Zina's father shot down in cold blood.
And you sit there and talk about compromising.
I'd rather be shot down
than go crawling on my belly...
asking a lot of murderers
to let me alone.
And i don't believe that the Lord said anything to you at all. if he picked anyone to be head of this church, it was Brigham Young.
And if Brigham tells me to stay here and fight, that's what i'm gonna do.
And if he tells me to pack up and go on somewhere else,
that's what i'm gonna do.
And there's nothing you or anybody else can say that'll stop me.
Can't anything stop me any more than it could stop my father... from saying he believed in Joseph Smith even if he knew he'd be killed for it. if you're in such a hurry to talk about compromising... you'd better get on your way right now.
Come on, Ma.
Eliza, i've always thought a lot of you and your husband... so i won't hold this against you.
Good day.
[ Hammering Metal ]
Young fella's got quite a temper, ain't he?
Brigham Young put him up to it.
You mark my words.
Who's that girl there with 'em? i never saw her before.
Must be an outsider.
Jonathan!
Jonathan! Look!
They're headed for Nauvoo.
You'd better get out the back way.
Looks like our runnin' days are over.
- Hallelujah.
- [ Knocking On Door ]
- Brigham Young?
- Yes, sir.
- Come right in.
- Thank you.
Young?
- How do you do, sir?
- How do you do? i've come over here to warn you.
You'd better get your people out of here just as fast as you can.
- Why?
- Because i've held off those mobs as long as i'm able.
From now on, i can't be responsible.
You mean you want us to leave everything we fought all our lives for? i mean, if you don't go and go quick... blood's going to run like water in the streets... and nothing i can do will stop it.
We're not budging one inch. i am sorry that's your answer... but i'm afraid the law can't help you much.
The law?
What law?
The law that lets a pack of scoundrels come in here... and hunt us down like wild animals?
Burn our homes,
ruin our crops?
Arrest our leader on trumped-up charges... and then looks the other way when a mob breaks in and murders him?
They call that law, let 'em keep it.
We don't want any more of it. i appreciate this warning, Major, but, no, this time... we're going to stand up for our rights if it kills us.
You tell that bunch of hoodlums that i said... if they come over here again, we're going to fight... clear down to our boots and up to our necks in blood.
You mean that, don't you?
- Do you doubt it?
- No.
Then i guess that's all we've got to say to each other.
- Good day, sir.
- Good day.
Funny thing that major taking it for granted that i was the head of the church.
Why didn't he go to Angus Duncan?
He's been going around from house to house... telling everybody he's been picked to run things.
Still, if i'm the head, why doesn't the Lord tell me so?
One thing's certain-- somebody's got to be head pretty soon... or there won't be any church left to be head of.
[ Thunder Rumbling ]
[ Thunder Rumbling ]
[ Thunder Continues ]
You'd better put this around you.
Brigham, they're over at the council hall meeting--
Duncan and Crum and the others.
They found out that the raids are gonna start all over again tonight.
Duncan says they're not gonna listen to you anymore.
They're gonna make peace with those people over in
Carthage any way they can.
Well, maybe he is head of the church.
Maybe it's up to him.
Brigham. i stood here in Joseph's footprints. i knelt where he did... trying as hard as i know how to get an answer... but the Lord won't talk to me.
He won't tell me what to do one way or the other.
He didn't say you were
not to head the church, did he?
He didn't say anything.
Brigham, when you asked me if i loved you... i didn't say anything either... but that didn't mean i didn't love you.
Sometimes silence is the best answer you can give a person.
Mary Ann,Joseph told me to run this church... and i'm going to run it the way it ought to be run until the Lord says no.
[ Thunder Rumbles ]
[ Duncan ] We're headed for
the worst trouble we've
ever had this very night...
unless we act
and act quick.
[ Man ] Minute they heard what
Brigham said about fighting,
they started organizing.
[ Duncan ] i wish i'd have been there to hear him. i'd have shut him up quick enough.
He's acting as if the Lord chose him to run this--
How else should i act? i hear you've been making some sort of a deal with those rats over in Carthage.
Whatever it is, you're not going through with it... because i'm taking the bull by the horns and spitting in both his eyes.
- We're leaving here tonight.
- Tonight?
- We're crossing into iowa.
- You can't bluster your way into power. it might do you some good to know that the Lord said--
- We cross the river into iowa tonight.
- Was it a revelation?
Yes.
That's a lie.
Angus, i'd like awfully well to see you live to a ripe old age.
Maybe you will if you hold your tongue.
- But the river is frozen over.
- How else could we all cross it in one night?
- But it's fixin' to storm.
- They'll never expect us to start.
- We couldn't get our things.
- The lighter we travel, the better time we make.
Don't listen to him.
We can't run off now and leave everything.
- i've got my granary to think about.
- And my store.
Every cent i've got in the world is right here.
Maybe we're getting too interested in granaries and stores and things.
Remember how when Joseph started out, he had an idea about nobody getting rich... but everybody sharing alike?
Somehow his idea seems to have got sidetracked.
- i figure it's time we got back to it.
- But i've worked hard.
- i've saved and scrimped.
- if a little money means more to you than this church... you'd better stay here.
Heber, put some fellas on horses.
Tell them to spread the word.
Tell everybody to come just as they are.
We've got to put the river between us and Nauvoo by morning... or there won't be enough of us left to worry about.
[ Duncan ]
No, no. Wait a minute.
Don't pay any attention to him.
You're making a mistake.
Think of your homes.
You'll just be run out of this state like we've been run out of every other state.
Listen to me.
You're making a mistake.
[ Door Slams ]
Here he is.
They won't compromise.
They won't do anything.
They're leaving.
- Leavin'?
- Where are they going?
- They're crossing the river into iowa tonight.
- You're lyin'. it's the truth. Brigham Young's making them leave.
- And good riddance.
- Now you won't have to raid.
You better get over there and see that they don't change their minds.
- We'll fix it so that they'll never come back.
- You won't hurt my property.
- i did my best. i played fair.
- You're no better than any other Mormon.
Look, there's plenty else.
What about that promise?
You're not gonna destroy my granary. it's full of Mormon wheat, ain't it?
- [ Pulley Squeaking ]
- [ Man ] Take it easy.
- [ Pulley Squeaking ]
- [ Man ] Take it easy.
Let 'er go.
Come on.!
[ Man ]
Get on.! Hyah.!
All right, Mary Ann. i'll meet you down at the river.
Lord, Brigham's a great and good man. i'm his wife, and i know. i've known him longer than anybody but you and Heber Kimball.
Only sometimes he's so sure of himself.
Sometimes he's bullheaded and thinks nobody else knows a thing but him.
But he's only trying to do what's right.
So won't you look after him... maybe speak to him?
Because this is an awful thing he's asking us to do.
And right now, in his heart... he's not half as sure of himself as he makes out to be.
Everybody meet on the other side of the river.
Get together on the other side of the river. Everybody.
[ Men Whistling,
Shouting ]
Jonathan. Meet at Sugar Creek on the other side of the river.
Right.
[ Man ]
Giddap there.!
Giddap.! Hah.!
Giddap there.!
Ho.!
All right, go ahead.
Keep moving.
Supposin' the ice breaks through? i'll get my horse.
Let me try.
[ Bleating ]
Ho! Hie!
[ Gunshots ]
Hyah!
[ Gunshots Continue ]
Come on!
Get those wagons across the ice!
- [ Gunshot ]
- [ Man ] Get your children
in the wagons.!
- Eliza!
- Henry! Henry!
[ Gunshots Continue ]
Come on! Hurry up!
Watch where you're going.
Keep driving.
Get those wagons across the ice!
Well, if you ask me, it looks like the end of the Mormon Church.
Come on.
Mary Ann, look.
Looks like we've burned our bridges behind us.
Couldn't turn back now even if we wanted to.
- Get your tuba.
- Tuba?
And get hold of the rest of the band.
Tell them i said to start playing.
Yes, sir.
- Where are we going?
- Well, wherever it is, we'll get there.
[ Band Plays Hymn ]

[ Muttering, indistinct ]

[ Rifle Clatters

[ Cattle Lowing ]
Brigham, there ain't no sense tryin' to hide the truth.
Folks are as mad as wet hens, cussin' you all over the camp... claimin' you're to blame for gettin' them in all this misery.
Everywhere you turn, they're gettin' ready to pull out.
- Where to?
- Well, anywhere but here.
They don't seem to know, but they say they're awful fools... pullin' up stakes and leavin' everything they got... to come out here and squat in the mud and slop till they freeze.
- That's enough, Mary Ann.
- it's high time somebody did some thinkin' around here.
Why, there ain't 50 families in camp ain't got somebody sick or hurt or already dead. it's true, Brigham. i've been out all mornin'... and it pret' near breaks your heart just to look at 'em.
And they've got to know what you're gonna do about it.
Mary Ann, you and Clara get Emmaline and Lucy and some of the others... and help you take this stuff around to those that need it just as soon as you can.
Well, what are you gonna do about it?
Well, i've got an idea, but they're gonna need... some of this hot composition in their bellies before they hear about it.
[ Exhales Loudly ]
What in tarnation's that? it's one of Brigham's remedies to put down colds and ague... and fever and rheumatism and such.
What's in it besides fire?
Hot water and cinnamon bark and ginger root... and cayenne pepper and anything else that's hot.
Throw the stuff out. Ain't folks sufferin' enough without burnin' their insides out?
- Feel better?
- i'm all right, thanks.
- [ Baby Crying ]
- You better give her to me.
- it's past her feeding time.
- Oh, but you're not strong enough to.
She's hungry.
[ Fire Crackling ]
- How's Ma?
- She's feeding the baby now.
Hmm. Doc Richards said he'd be over in a minute.
Plenty more hurt. i wish he'd hurry up and come.
Zina, there's a family fixin' to pull out today... and i've arranged that you can go with them.
No, i'm not going. i couldn't leave your mother and the children... what with her hurt and everything.
- But we got no call on you.
- No, i-- i'll stay.
That's nice of you,
Zina.
Ma will appreciate that.
- How's your mother?
- You know Ma.
She doesn't complain.
She's a fine woman.
- New convert?
- No, sir. i'm not a Mormon.
- What are you doing here?
- Her father was killed the night they raided our place... and she's been staying with us ever since.
Well, i guess we can feed one more mouth.
Thank you, but that doesn't mean i'm going to be a Mormon.
- You don't seem to like Mormons.
- No, it isn't that.
But, well, it's just that i'm a Christian.
- So am i.
- Well, i mean, i've got my own religion. i wouldn't change that for anything or anybody.
And besides--
- ''Besides'' what?
- Well, there must be something wrong when there's so much hate... people being tortured, killed... everything they've got in the world taken away from them.
A lot of folks seem to think it worth going through all that for.
[ All Chattering ]
You folks have been doing a lot of worrying... and wanting to know what we're going to do next.
Well, in the first place, we're gonna start acting like we've got some common sense.
We're gonna build some strong new wagons, gather in all the food we can... get enough guns and ammunition, warm clothes and whatever else we need... and then we're gonna get out of here.
And we're gonna keep going until we're clear out of the United States...
across the Rocky Mountains
into Mexico.
- Hallelujah.
- Mexico? Across the Rocky Mountains?
When it's got to the place a man can't stay in the United States... and believe what he wants to, then he's got to get out.
- [ Man ] That's 1,500 miles.
Take us four years to get there.
- [ Young ]Just about. it took Moses 40 years to get where he was going.
- [ Man ]
But 1,500 miles.! We'd starve.!
- [ All Chattering ]
Doggone you, Brigham Young.
We've stood for all your foolishness we're aimin' to. i'm through, through with the whole dang setup. i'm quittin'. You understand?
Quittin' you and the church. i'm goin' someplace where me and my family can live.
[ All Chattering ] i know. i know it's not an easy thing i'm asking you to do.
But we can do it if we've got faith enough.
There's good stock here, Lord.
They're about as fine a bunch of men and women as ever lived.
All they need is a little bucking up... and a kick in the right direction so's-- so's they'll know their own strength.
And then you'll see how soon they'll stop all this infernal whining... and all this talk about running off, quitting the church.
First thing you know, they'll be letting their beards grow.
They'll be getting dirt
under their fingernails...
and calluses on their hands
as big as hoecakes.
And they'll be ready to whip
the tar out of the first fellow... that says we'll never make it. if there's anybody here doubts that, they'd better haul tail right now... because we don't want 'em.
We'll build our wagons, and we'll scratch for our food.
We'll shiver, and we'll go hungry if we have to.
And maybe some of us will keel over and die in our tracks... but that won't stop us neither.
Because the rest of us will keep going, and we'll never stop.
Never, not until we've found the place.
[ Young's Voice ]
Well, Lord, we're on our way.
Just as far as the eye can see,
they keep comin'
I doubt if there's been
anything to equal this...
since the children of Israel
set out across the Red Sea...
and you--
you had to open up the waters
to let 'em through.
And talk about miracles.
Just take a look at the way
some of these wagons
have hung together.
Of course, it took
plenty of scurrying around
to get together what we did.
But I knew that as soon
as we stopped arguin'..
and grumblin'about
what had to be done...
and started findin'ways
to do it, that we'd manage all right.
Some of our folks aren't really
in shape to travel.
Some, like Eliza,
with bullet holes in 'em.
Everybody,young or old,
has his or her work cut out.
The women are busy
sewing, mending, weaving...
or taking care of the babies,
doing the cooking.
And the men
who don't have to drive
or look after the livestock...
are turning out new shoes
and seeing that
our harnesses hold out.
And we don't aim to let
our children get far behind
in their lessons either.
Classes are being held
every foot of the way
so's it'll never be said...
that a Mormon
can't read and write
with the best of them.
[ Woman ]
Seventy-two--
Yes, sir, we're on our way.
Load your wagons and get ready to start.
There's only about five feet of water.
[ Man ]
Ho there.! it's all right,Jonathan.
We can make it. it's only about five feet deep.
Take care of him. it's only about five feet deep.
Come on!
[ Cattle Lowing ]
- Can you swim?
- No.
- You will.
- [ Screaming ]
[ Woman Screams ]
[ Screams ]
Whoa, boy!
[Jonathan ] All right.
Now straighten it out.
- There. All right.
- We should've built arks instead of wagons. if we had, we could've floated clear to the Rocky Mountains.
Has this wagon grown roots?
Angus, i didn't know you were here.
- Yep. in the mud with the rest of us.
- it's my church too, Brigham.
Sure it is. if we all push together, we'll get someplace.
- All right. All together.
- All together.
Heave! Heave!
[ Young ]
Lord, the way these sisters
swing an ax is a caution.
They go at it as if they had
the devil himself on the ground...
fixin'to lop offhis tail.
In the meanwhile,
we keepjogging along...
putting plenty
of good Iowa mud between us...
and those scoundrels
back in Carthage.
It's rough country
we're going through...
and it's just as hard
on the wagons as it is
on them inside.
Zina, come here.
What do you want? i want her to drive, Ma. i want to find Brigham.
Tell him we're gonna drop out for a little while.
We can catch up later.
- All this jolting--
- You keep going. if you let one stop, then somebody else will want to stop too.
Then a third and a fourth, and, before you know it... the whole shootin' match will be fallin' out. i don't want it said that we were the first to give up.
Not for anything.
Understand?
Zina, you go and sit with Jonathan. it ain't right you cooped up in here... and all that springtime outside.
Go on now, dear.
[ Young ]
We've been seeing Indians, Lord,
for several days now.
Sometimes there's just one.
Sometimes
there's two or three.
Sometimes a whole tribe
just lookin'
Porter Rockwell says that...
their main village
is up ahead at Council Bluffs...
and there must be a couple
of thousand around here
and with more comin'
Kind of gives you
a creepy feelin'..
knowing they've got
their eyes on you.
Some of our folks are getting
downright uneasy...
but I tell them,
''Indians can't be any worse...
than some Christians
I know. ''
Till we find out
a little bit more about them...
we mean to trust
in you, Lord...
and to keep
our powder dry.
Zigzagging. That means he wants to talk in peace.
You zigzag out to meet him.
My name's
Brigham Young.
We folks have been run out of our homes... and some of us are pretty tired and sick.
We'd like to stop in Council Bluffs for a while.
My people knows of your coming.
We know why you are here.
As Superintendent of indians, my advice is to say no.
Not many years ago, we were driven out of our homes.
You are welcome here.
Chief, those are the first words of real welcome... we've heard in 1 6 years.
And don't think we're going to forget them.
You can count on us for anything you want.
[ Young ]
We're welcome here!
We can stay here as long as we want to.
Unhook your oxen, turn them out to graze.
Clara. Mary.
We're welcome here.
We can stay as long as we want to.
Oh, i'm so glad,
Brigham.
Tell everybody to unhook their oxen and horses.
They can hunt too.
This country is running
over with wild game.
Look, Brigham, good, rich earth.
Sure.
Anything would grow here. i think i'll let the main body stay here and raise a crop.
The rest of us will push on and find someplace to settle in.
They can follow us later and bring whatever they've raised.
Tell the people the band's going to play tonight.
Tell them we're going to sing and dance like we used to.
First you tell us we can rest.
Now you say we have to dance. i bet i've lost a foot of belly since we started out.
- it's good for the figure.
- it looks good. i'm going to take a bath, even if i muddy up the whole dang river.
You'd better go now, because this afternoon you're going to be awful busy.
- Buryin'.
- Buryin'?
There's quite a few... counting the old folks, babies.
- Eliza Kent went this morning.
- Eliza?
Jonathan.
Why didn't you tell me about Eliza?
She didn't want me to.
None of them did.
She told me to tell you, Brigham... that even though we might be the last wagon... we'd never be the first to fall out. i just couldn't go away without leaving her some kind of marker.
You know,
Ma used to say... that a good wheel always sings.
Ma would've loved those flowers. i never saw a body so crazy about 'em.
Dandelion, ragweed,
any of'em.
Sonny, will you hold him?
- Hi.
- Howdy.
- Mind if i get a drink?
- Nope.
You one of them
Mormon fellas?
- Yes, we're Mormons.
- i heard you was coming.
Leaving off the ''mister,'' my name is Jim Bridger.
- What might yours be?
- Leaving off the ''mister,''
Brigham Young.
- Say, how many--
- Twelve.!
Hmm. How about a chaw to oil your tongue with?
No, thanks. i never use it.
How come?
What's the matter with you?
- You see this?
- Mm-hmm. i've been carrying that now for 1 5 years.
Whenever i feel myself tempted, i hold it up and say...
''Am i stronger than this tobacco or is this tobacco stronger than me?''
And I put it back
in my pocket. i'll be doggoned.
[ Children Shouting ]
- Little more?
- No, thanks.
You?
Yes, sir. it's all over California, i tell you.
And some of them nuggets are as big as the hub on a cart wheel.
Sounds like tomfoolery to me.
My brother ain't the tomfoolin' kind.
He wrote me all about it.
All you got to do is yank up a pea vine... scrape the ground with your finger and there it is.
Gold-- any way you turn, pretty and yellow...
- ready to buy anything you want.
- Don't go blabbing it around.
We don't want people talking about how rich she is... leastwise until we get California into the United States... now that we've been dragged into this war with Mexico.
[ Chuckles ]
Don't worry about us talkin'.
See that you don't talk to our people about it and get them upset.
We're not searchin' for gold.
We're searchin' for a place to live.
You don't have to worry about us either.
Well, thanks.
Good-bye.
- Bye.
- Bye.
What's the matter with you?
Have you gone out of your mind? i don't think so. i had to hush those fellas up. i've just had a revelation.
There's gold in California.
Well, this is a revelation, and i think the church... is about to find a new leader.
As captains, each of you are in charge of 1 00 people. it's up to me and you to see that the Lord's will be done. if there's all that gold out in California... it seems strange and peculiar nobody's heard about it before.
The Lord chose when he wanted it known... and who he wanted to know it.
Now you brothers get busy.
Each of you know who you can trust in your own companies.
What's Brigham Young gonna say when he finds out about this?
The Lord will handle that too.
Zina.
- Zina, are you asleep?
- Uh-uh. Aren't you?
No. if you were asleep... i bet i could tell you what you'd be dreaming about.
- What?
- All that gold in California.
[ Sighs ]
Just imagine, Zina.
Chunks of it as big as oranges.
Wish i had an orange right now. i'd cut a hole in the stem for the baby to suck.
About the best thing there is for colic.
Gold.
You know, next to the Lord and maybe the land... i reckon it's about the most powerful thing there is.
Hmm.
What would you do with all that gold?
Oh, about a million things. i'd get a new saddle.
And i figure that the wagon needs a new doubletree.
Baby ought to have a cradle to rock in.
And you-- i'd get you a new dress and a hat.
Lots of boats come into California from China and everyplace... full of silk and things. i'd get you a parasol and shoes to match...
pretty finger ring--
lots of things, Zina.
All you got for yourself was a saddle.
Well, maybe i'll get me a horse to go under it.
Jonathan, suppose
Brigham Young doesn't want to go to California.
He couldn't help it. it's-- it's just like the promised land.
Zina?
You know what i've been thinking about?
Sounds funny, but... i've been lying here thinking about the time... before i got into long pants.
All the talking i used to do about... what i was gonna do as soon as i got into grown-up britches.
Now, I don't know, I--
I don't even care anymore.
Reckon the only thing i care about is... having somebody like me... likin' them and... just always bein' with 'em.
Zina.
Zina, seein' as you're so crazy about the children... and they're so crazy about you--
Well, i was just wondering if--
Course, i mean, after we get settled... and i get a crop goin' and some of that gold i was talkin' about.
Well, i was sort of hopin' that maybe you and me could, uh...
[ inhales, Exhales
Slowly ] get married.
Hmm? i told you to let me cook that stew.
- Sure was good stew though.
- Henry, shut up and go back to sleep.
- [ Crowd Clamoring ]
- [ Shouting ]
Ladies and gentlemen!
Ladies and gentlemen!
For the championship of Fort Bridger, a frog-jumping contest... between the defending champion...
- Jim Bridger...
- [ Cheers, Applause ] and the challenger...
- Porter Rockwell.!
- [ Cheers, Applause ]
- i'll bet you Porter wins.
- Bet what?
Oh, that new silk dress i'm gonna get against the horse you're gonna get.
Sounds like a fair bet.
[ Man Stuttering ]
G-G-Get set.!
T-T-T-Tickle 'em.!
[ Onlookers Shouting ]
Come on, Bridger!
Looks like you're not gonna get that dress you haven't got yet.
[ Shouting, Cheering
Continue ]
Dang saints, listen to 'em.
Gambling.
- They're only tryin' to have a little fun.
- Fun?
There's whiskey bein' drunk.
Porter Rockwell is chewing tobacco again.
- Since when did he ever stop?
- i'm not going to put up with it.
- i'll not have the devil flipping his tail in my face.
- Brigham.
Why do you lie to yourself?
You're worried about all this talk of gold... and going to California.
Day and night, that fella Duncan has been at 'em... with his talk about gold.
That all you do is stick a seed in the ground, and it pops up before you can turn around.
You're dead set against
California, aren't you?
You know human nature.
Take a crowd of people to a place of milk and honey... and in six months' time, they won't be worth shooting.
Our only chance is to find someplace... that nobody else has even put foot on.
Sometimes i think i'm being punished... for saying the Lord told me to take charge. i don't think so.
Not after what you've done to hold us together.
[ People Chattering ] if i only knew for sure where we're heading.
You set out to find a place across the Rocky Mountains... where we could live in peace according toJoseph's plan.
That's what the people trusted you to do. i wouldn't disappoint 'em.
Mary Ann, you're as fine a wife as a man ever had.
Sometimes, i don't know what i'd do without you.
Always the same, never complaining.
You're never jealous of the others.
No, Brigham.
Sometimes, i think the Lord has been almost too good to me... just letting me take care of a fine man like you.
That's funny.
When folks have been together as long as we have, it's-- it's kind of hard to say what's in your heart... about lovin' a person. i know.
Remember when i was courtin' you... how we used to sit out just like this on moon-bright nights?
[ Chuckles ]
Mm-hmm. i remember.
Suppose you had to do it all over again?
Would you still have me... knowing all you do about me... and all that you've had to go through?
Yes, Brigham. i'd do it exactly the same.
[ Young ]
Well, Lord, here we are again.
All I keep hearing
is talk of gold in California.
So far I haven't said anything,
that is, the way I feel about it...
figuring that as long
as we're heading west,
they'll be satisfied.
I can't
keep that up forever.
I'm not feeling
very well myself.
I don't seem to be able
to eat or sleep.
And then I'm all cold inside,
kind of shaky.
I must have got hold
of some bad water back yonder.
Maybe it's a touch
of mountain fever...
from eating that
rabbit stew the other night.
You've got to help me
find the right place, Lord...
and find it quick.
Because I can't go on
like this much longer.
[ No Audible Dialogue ] i tell you, Mary Ann, if we lose him, we're done for.
Well, they're leavin'.
They're goin' to California.
- Leavin'?
- it's that white-livered skunk Duncan.
- Didn't you talk to him?
- Talk to him? Sure.
That doesn't do any good.
- They can't leave him like this.
- That Duncan's so shrewd...
he's got people thinking everything
he's doin'is to help Brigham.
Go hitch up the horses and help me get him into the wagon.
- You're not takin' him?
- i am.
He's not able to move.
He'd never forgive me or you either if we let the people go on without him.
- Woman, he'll die.
- He can't stand it. i know the risk i'm takin'.
But if Brigham has to die, it'll be with his people.
You'd want it that way, wouldn't you, Clara? it'll kill him. i'll hitch up the horses.
You get him ready.
Come on.
- Where are we?
- High up in the mountains, Brigham.
What's that strange noise i keep hearing? it's an echo. The wagons sound like a lot of hammers goin'.
Porter set to whistlin' a while back. You'd have thought it was a dozen flutes playin'.
Look out and tell me what you see.
There's nothing but mountains.
Over yonder's one
a mile high.
No, not there.
Look south.
The mountains suddenly fall away?
- Over here they do.
- You can see, maybe... a hundred miles straight off.
Yes, i can.
Pull up.
This is the place.
We'll build our homes down there. it was a revelation.
He knew it before we even got here. it was a revelation.
- [ Whispering ]
- it was a revelation. i thought we were going to California.
So did i.
You said that Brigham Young himself would want to go.
Well, i thought he would.
This isn't the place.
This isn't the place!
Look at it. it's nothing but a lot of desert!
Just a lot of sand and rock!
We'll shrivel up and die like rats.
We're going to California, do you understand?
- We're going to set up our own church.
- Are you?
Yes, we are.
We let you drag us away from Nauvoo.
We left every cent, everything we owned in the world.
We've watched you mark every foot of the way up here... with the bodies of our women and babies, and we haven't said a word.
But when it comes to stopping and settling in a place like that-- the most desolate country we've seen yet-- with California just up ahead waiting for us, it's time to call a halt.
He says God told him this is the place.
But i say it was the devil talking.
And as far as i'm concerned, the devil can keep it!
- We're going on!
- All right, Angus.
That's the way to California. i'm not going to stop you. i wouldn't lift my little finger to hold you... or anybody else that feels the same way.
Moses went up in the hills like this once... and right away the devil started putting in his licks.
Remember how he got the people to build a golden calf and to start worshipping it?
You remember how mad
God and Moses got...
and how close God came
to washing his hands
of the whole business? i don't claim to be a Moses... but i say to you just what he said to the sons of Levi:
''Who is on the Lord's side, let him come unto me.''
Well, you can have your desert. i'm going to California.
[ Angus ] Come on.
You said you were comin', didn't you?
You're goin', aren't you?
Well, are you comin'
or not?
Think of your family
and your children.
What's the matter with you?
You're not gonna build your home
down in that desert, are you?
You'll all starve to death.
Come on. Get up and get goin'.
You said you were comin' with me.
Think of your family!
Our hearts... are mighty humble and mighty thankful.
Lord, we'll make this desert blossom.
There'll be hamlets and cities... vineyards and orchards... with every kind of tree there is.
There'll be no filth in our cities.
There'll be no ugliness of any sort but... broad, clean streets with flowing water.
And the law of the valley
shall be that...
no man may buy or sell land...
for all land
will be held in common.
It'll be measured off
to him, both in the city
and for farming.
And any man may have
as much as he can till...
but he's got to take care
of all he gets.
All wood and timber will
belong to the community, too...
as well as ditches
and canals.
Any person caught
trying to take greedy advantage
of these materials...
will be run
out of the valley.
Now, as to the city itself...
it shall be built in
blocks of ten acres each...
with streets
eight rods wide...
and with gardens and lawns
on both sides.
Right in the middle,
I'm setting aside ten acres
for the temple...
which we'll start building
the day we get our first crop
in the ground.
We're going to establish
Joseph's idea of the United Order...
and build
a mighty empire here...
based on labor and love
and fellowship.
And this time,
doggone it...
I mean to see
that we stick to it.
[ Brass Band ]
- [ Continues ]
- Zina. Come on. We have to hurry!
[ Continues ]
- [ Ends ]
- it's a nice sight to see you people... come up here to put your food in a common storehouse... to be rationed out to everybody alike during the coming winter.
Joseph Smith would be proud of you. it's not just a tithe we're giving this time... although that's the law of the church... but everything we've got. if one eats, we'll all eat.
And if one starves, we'll all starve.
Now, we're gonna have our hands full to make this food last until spring.
So don't waste anything.
Eat regular...
but don't let me
catch any of you people
putting on weight.
Now it's up to us men
to fish and hunt and lay in stores.
And you boys get out
and see how many rabbits
you can lay your hands on.
But don't eat 'em.
Pen 'em up and give 'em
time to multiply...
- like good saints.
- [ Chuckles ]
All right, you fellas in the band, let's hear... ''Come, Come Ye Saints,'' while everybody takes their food over to the storehouse.
And play it good and loud, especially loud.
Leah.
Well, all right, dear. Martha.
John. Harriet.
[ Continues ]
Oh,Jonathan. i'd like for you to go with Porter back to Council Bluffs.
Tell the people there to harvest their crops... but that they must stay there through the winter.
Then they can join us in the spring and bring whatever food's left.
Well, i-- i'll look after them.
- Will you do it?
- Why, yes, sir.
- When can you start?
- i'll be ready to leave by tomorrow morning.
Thank you,Jonathan.
- That all right with you, Porter?
- Fine. See you in the morning.
Good.
How long are you gonna be gone?
Four or five months, i guess.
He has no right to ask you to go.
You've got a family to look after.
Besides, there are plenty of others who can go in your place.
You know how it is here.
Everybody has his job to do.
- This is mine, and i've got to do it.
- Brigham-- Brigham Young.
Don't you care what anybody else thinks or feels?
- He's head of the church.
- Even if he is, he isn't God.
- He can't run everything.
- He'll look after you and the children. i can look after the children, and i'm not worrying about me. it's just that--
Oh. i'm sorry that you had to go and get mad.
- i'm not mad.
- 'Cause if you hadn't been mad... i had it in my mind to tell you about something. i'm not mad!
Well, if you'd been in smilin' good humor, i meant to talk about it.
- Talk about what?
- What i was gonna talk about... if you hadn't got mad.
Maybe you had a revelation.
Well, you might call it that.
We ought to get married right away.
- Right away?
- Well, in the spring... soon as i get back.
Well, i don't see any sense in puttin' it off any longer than that.
Oh, but your Brigham Young'll want you to marry a Mormon girl, won't he?
- Several of them.
- Several? if you're gonna be rich, you'll have to have a lot of wives, won't you? i've been wonderin' how you're gonna go about askin' 'em-- one at a time or all together.
Maybe it would be easier if you said,
''Sisters, will you kindly marry me?''
- Zina!
- Then after you've married
20 or 30 of them... suppose you get to lovin' one more than all the rest put together?
Then there's poorJonathan, loving one and divided by 30.
Now, Zina, you're just talking nonsense.
There they'll be, all darning the same socks and cooking for the same man... and all talking about
their husband.
Just imagine, 30 wives combing your beard!
You haven't answered my question yet about our being married.
Oh, well, it-- it isn't spring yet.
Well, figure it out for yourself.
Say every man's got 20 wives.
- There aren't that many women.
- Oh, we can get 'em.
Women convert easy. And say every wife's got ten children.
That's 200 children apiece.
And say every one of those 200's got 20 wives.
That's 4,000. And say they got ten children apiece.
So that'll give you
40,000 grandchildren.
Figurin' 5,000 men to start with.
Well, that's 200 million.
Quite a settlement. if arithmetic'll do you any good, i'm willin' to call you grandpa now.
Oh, i'm aimin' to do my share.
[ Young ] I don't remember,
Lord, ever seein'a winter
to equal this one.
Started out mild enough,
but now it's hit for sure.
It's just one blizzard
after another.
Snow is so deep that game
has run clean out of the hills.
[ Lowing ]
And even what little cattle
we had left are lost...
or they're frozen to death
where we can't get at 'em.
I've had to cut rations
three times already...
till there's hardly enough
to keep body and soul together.
The babies look mighty hungry
and peaked to me.
The women and the old folks
arejust hangin'on...
livin'on roots or whatever
they could lay their hands to.
Well,just the same,
we're gonna hold out till spring...
when the winter wheat
and the new corn come through.
I don't know how
we're gonna do it...
but we're going to,
Lord, somehow.
[ Crying ]
Mary.
Mary, dear.
- Would you like to play a game with me?
- What kind of a game?
Well, it hasn't any name, but here's the way you play it.
Now first, open up your apron.
Why, that's it.
Now, see the sun in it?
- Yes.
- All right. Now fold your apron back.
Quickly.
Catch the sun.
That's right.
Got it?
All right.
Now bring it over here to me and the baby.
Careful.
Don't drop it.
All right.
Now open your apron and let's see it.
Oh, it's gone. You've lost it.
You had it just a minute ago. i saw you catch it.
Look. There it is. it's still over there on the floor.
Hurry up.
Get it.
Zina, i-- i don't feel like playing. i-- i'm hungry.
[ Weeping ]
Oh, don't, darling.
Don't.
- [ Sniffling, Sobbing ]
- Now, don't cry, sweetie.
[ Mary Crying ]
Jonathan!
Jonathan, i'm hungry.
Hungry?
- Zina, what happened?
- [ Sobbing ]
[ Crying ]
Tablespoon every hour.
Now there's no use playing possum any longer, Miss Zina.
Anybody as pretty as you are can't be very sick.
That girl in there, there's no telling how long it's been... since she's had anything to eat.
- She probably gave everything to the children.
- Yes.
And she isn't the only one who's done that.
- She'll be all right, though, won't she, Doctor?
- i hope so, son.
Now--
Come on now. i'd hate to have to hold your nose and pour.
Zina, Doc Richards said you have to eat something.
Careful. it's hot.
You'll never be hungry again. i promise you that, Zina.
Never again as long as you live.
Open.
There.
You know, all the time i was gone, i kept thinking about... well, how soon it was going to be spring.
One day... it was just about noontime... but i made old Porter stop and camp... right on the spot where our wagon stood that night.
Remember?
You almost promised to marry me... but you fell asleep.
Remember? i asked you again before i went away.
You told me it wasn't spring yet.
Well, it's here now.
Oh, if thinking could've helped to make the time go quicker... spring would've come an awful lot earlier this year. it's no use.
We'll never be able to get married now.
Zina, you couldn't mean that.
[ Sobs ] i tried to believe. i almost did once.
Not anymore. i can't.
There's nothing left to believe in.
- What are you doing?
- Well, the boys are eatin' 'em... and-and the indians eat 'em and--
You kids get in the house.
Go on. Hurry up.
Get!
Jonathan!
Hello,Jonathan. i'm glad to see you.
- What's the matter?
- You promised to take care of Zina.
She's so sick over there, she hasn't even got the strength to eat.
She doesn't care whether she lives or dies. i don't believe God would let that happen.
- God? What's he got to do with it?
-Jonathan! if there is a God, where has he been?
Where is he now?
-Jonathan!
- You said you'd take care of her.
You said a heap of other things, too, but you sayin' 'em didn't make 'em so.
But me, i believed 'em just because it was you sayin' 'em. if you'd told me you was
God Almighty himself... i reckon i'd have believed that too.
But not now, not anymore.
Pa dead. Ma dead.
Everything that i ever loved dead.
Just because you said God wanted it that way.
And now Zina.
We were plannin' to go to California like the others. i told her we would.
We had it all fixed up between us, but no.
You wouldn't let us go.
You said God wanted us to come down here.
He wouldn't let us starve.
And i thought you meant it. i thought God was talkin' to you every step of the way.
God talkin'to you--
Maybe you and him
don't speak the same language. i know you and i don't, not anymore.
Why did you do it?
Why didn't you leave us alone?
Why did you have to take everything that we love-- even God?
Brigham!
Brigham!
Brigham, come on. There's bugs-- crickets-- millions of'em!
- Where?
- Comin' down the mountain.
They're in the wheat already.
- They're eating the wheat.
- Half the fields are covered already.
Crickets in the fields!
Hurry!
[ Pounding ]
Hurry! The crickets are ruining the wheat!
[ Man Shouting ]
Come on! The fields are full of crickets!
What are you gonna do? i don't know.
Go on out to the grain fields.
Listen, people!
Don't waste your time here!
Let's save the grain!
Come on!
Here, you children, get away from there. Let's hope we can find your ma. Come on.
[ Banging ]
- Food?
- Run and get some wood and start a fire.
Mary, you get some clean water in a pot.
Honey, a plague has struck the place.
Crickets are overrunning the fields.
As soon as you get your strength back, we're gonna get out of here.
We're going to California like i promised.
Brigham!
Brigham! Look!
Millions and millions--
the hills are black with 'em.!
They're too much for us, Brigham. it's no use.
Might as well try to push back the ocean with a broom. i told you what would happen if we stopped in this valley... but you wouldn't listen to me!
You ran off with a false prophet!
That's why this happened! it's true.
We're all gonna die!
You brought us out into this place to starve, you--you devil you!
But we've one chance!
Repent and throw him out of here!
- it's true. You ought to be run out of here!
- Yes, you!
[ Angry Shouting ] i wouldn't do that if i was you!
And i'll plug the first one of you that moves!
[ inhales Deeply ] it's true. i lied to 'em, Lord. i told them that you said i was to run things.
But you and i know you didn't.
Do anything you want to me, but-- but save them, especially now when they need you most.
Only your strength is left. i'm licked. i'm all done in.
From now on, it's up to you.
What am i going to do,
Mary Ann? i meant to do so much for them. i've got to tell 'em the truth... even if they kill me for it. i've got to tell 'em.
[ Bell Ringing ]
[ Ringing Continues ]
[ People Murmuring ]
- [ Murmuring Continues ]
- [ Young ] Listen to me, people.
You've a right to know the truth. i told you that the Lord wanted me to run this church. i said he wanted you to build your homes in this valley.
And I promised you in his name
that you wouldn't starve...
that no harm
would come to you.
- i used the Lord's name.
- [ Gulls Squawking ]
[ Man ]
Seagulls!
- [ Squawking Continues ]
- [ Excited Chatter ]
The sky is black with seagulls.
They're headed toward the fields.
Look!
They're eating the crickets!
[ Excited Chatter]
- Oh, our crops are saved!
- Look at them eat!
There are more coming!
Hallelujah.
- What is it?
- Zina, you'll have to see it for yourself.
You see, Brigham?
He was talkin' to you all the time.
Maybe that's the way it is.
Maybe he's ready to say something any way you turn... if you only know how to listen.
Maybe talk-- speech like we use-- maybe that's not his language at all. i know what you're thinking.
Maybe we were both wrong.
There is something to live for.
[ Young ] And someday, good Lord,
we'll build a great city here...
on the shores of Salt Lake.
And when we do,
we'll erect a monument...
to the glory of God...
and to the symbol
ofhis benevolence--
the seagull.
- Have a nice trip?
- Yes. Very nice.
- Expecting someone?
- I guess not.
Say, where's the stage office?
Right over there, back of the depot.
Thank you.
Doggone your hide, Blossom. Look at that.
Look what you went and done.
I am telling you, Blossom, that makes you... the most aggravating female
I ever had a despise for.
I ought to poison you.
- Howdy.
- That the stage for Santa Inez?
Leaves in a minute. We've just got... a couple passengers to pick up at the hotel.
Santa Inez, $17.50.
- Your name?
- Rocklin.
Mind if I ride alongside the driver?
It's all right with me if it's all right with Dave.
He's mad. It's his last trip.
Had a row with Harolday, the boss.
Old-timer, Dave.
- Grumpy old cuss. I can remember...
- I like grumpy old cusses.
Hope to live long enough to be one.
Here's your mail, Dave.
And one more passenger.
Mind if I ride here?
- Where's them women?
- Up at the hotel.
Why ain't they here?
This is the stage depot, ain't it?
You can pick them up there.
It's just up the street.
"It's just up the street."
And they can't walk it?
What's the matter?
Don't easterners have legs like other folk?
Hold tight when you get in the mountains, mister.
When he gets riled, you can hear the passengers praying for miles.
Where are them women?
Waiting for you to carry them out?
Hey, Dave.
Will you tell Arly Harolday her saddle ain't ready yet?
I ain't telling that crazy female nothing.
Last time I see her, she threatened to rip the hide off me... and bat me dizzy with it.
Say, mister, will you tell the agent at Santa Inez... to tell Miss Harolday her saddle ain't ready yet.
- I'll say that.
- Thank you.
- This trunk go?
- Yes, it goes.
By next year, madam, we expect to have a bathtub on every floor.
Don't drop it!
At your age, you best not be lifting things so heavy.
Maybe you're young enough to hoist it up there your own self.
Dave will have his little jokes.
Clara!
Staring as if you've never seen a man before in your life.
I hope you have a nice trip, ladies.
If we get there.
Wouldn't surprise me if we didn't.
You wait till I get you on the road.
- Ever ride with Dave before, mister?
- Nope.
Then try and hold him down.
He'll scare the women to death.
I never feel sorry for anything that happens to a woman.
Wonder why a young fella who don't have to... wants to come into this dad-blamed country.
You mean what you said back there about women?
Yep.
Then you're smarter than most.
Maybe I've seen more of them than most.
Shouldn't be surprised.
Shouldn't be a little mite surprised.
All the same...
Have a snort.
Whisky and women.
You ever think how much alike they are?
They both fool you, but you never figure how to do without them.
- Have another.
- Not just yet, thanks.
- Well, here's to her.
- Who?
The next one that fools you.
- Want me to spell you for a while?
- Nope.
I've had a couple of snorts, but that don't make no difference.
Leastwise, never has.
Don't ever get old and wore-out and useless like me.
- Who says you are?
- Boss Harolday, for one.
I ain't bellyaching.
I reckon he's entitled to his opinion... but him and me never did see eye to eye.
- What's wrong?
- It's constitutional, I reckon.
He's too darn sane, believing in law and order.
What's wrong with law and order?
That depends on who's dishing it out.
I never was much on taking orders myself.
And as for the law... you'll find out what that means around these parts.
Driver!
- Driver, what's the matter?
- Nothing. Resting the horses.
You can get out and stretch your legs if you like.
Resting horses? What for?
I can see with my own eyes it's downhill.
Are you in such an all-fired hurry, lady?
Certainly we're in a hurry!
Then, we'll hurry some.
Help!
Help!
Now what's the matter?
Why are you stopping again?
Indigestion.
Why do we stop here?
- Somebody say something?
- I did! Why do we stop here?
If you want to eat and stretch your legs.
Will you please stop referring to my legs?
You got some, ain't you?
Zeke!
Dave!
- You two-legged old sidewinder.
- Howdy do, ladies.
- How about something to eat?
- lf it won't take too long.
Right this way.
You know, Zeke, this is my last trip.
Why?
'Cause Harolday won't take back what he said.
No? What did he say?
"You're fired."
Here you are, folks.
Just dig in and help yourself.
Ain't you gonna eat, mister?
I'll have some coffee.
- Supper, Dave?
- No. I'm drinking mine.
Set them up.
Young man, our driver's had all the liquor he can take.
Has he?
You know he has.
You're not a complete fool, are you?
Frequently.
The rudeness of people in these parts is appalling.
Mighty nice aroma of veal around here.
Doing yourself pretty well these days, Stan?
A friend of mine was by, sold me a quarter of beef.
Same friend that sold you that hide...
Bob here found hidden away in your barn yesterday?
Hide? What hide?
One that might send you to the penitentiary.
- What did you do with it, Stan?
- I never had no hide hidden out.
I saw it yesterday under the hay.
- It must still be there.
- No, it ain't. We looked.
Where is it?
- I tell you...
- What is all this?
Afternoon, ma'am. Miss Cardell, ain't it?
- Martin. Miss Martin. This is Miss Cardell.
- Pleased to meet you, miss.
Been expecting you down at Santa Inez.
I'm Sheriff Jackson.
- What's going on with him?
- Just a little matter of the law.
- Rustling.
- A thief.
- I tell you...
- Save it!
Matter of fact, Bob here says the hide he saw yesterday... had the KC brand on it.
What do you intend doing about it?
The law's pretty harsh around here on cattle thieves.
Of course, we don't want to make no mistake with an old-timer...
How about the owner of that beef?
Might he not have something to say about it?
- Meaning?
- Red Cardell.
He's the owner of the KC, isn't he?
You're way behind the herd, mister.
Red Cardell died three weeks ago.
- Was murdered, you mean.
- That's right.
Shot in the back not far from here.
Maybe he was getting onto things... about the cattle that's been missing from the KC lately.
- I tell you, I never had no hide.
- You got beef.
Yeah, and I got a bill of sale for it, too.
Suppose you let me see that bill of sale.
Sure. It's right out here.
Like I said, I wouldn't want to make no mistake with an old-timer.
That's her. The old one.
- She ain't got no legs.
- Hold your tongue!
And you.
Stop staring as if we were monsters.
We have to have another drink.
- Where's Stan?
- He's inside, explaining away a hide.
It seems they're eating stolen beef.
Somebody's loco.
Stan might give house-room to a little dead beef... but he'd never be fool enough to leave the hide laying around.
How about it, Zeke?
That's the way it is, Dave.
- It's you, huh?
- Yeah, your old pal Bob Clews.
Get away from me, you two-timing horse thief.
Them's fighting words, partner.
Stan, don't let them hang nothing on you you ain't done.
They're just a couple of four flushers, the pair of them.
- Everybody knows that.
- Crazy drunk.
Sure I'm drunk.
That's why I'm telling the truth.
I'm drunk, and I'll say what I think.
I'll say what I know.
Don't act up this ways, Dave.
There's women watching.
- Take your dirty paws off me.
- What he needs is a short lay-down.
Me and Bob will look after him.
Come on, Bob. We're his friends.
Take your hands off me.
I can take care of myself.
Careful, now. Don't hurt him.
How are things standing now between you and the law?
All right, I reckon.
I guess this bill of sale kind of winded him.
Lucky you saved it.
- We laid him down. He went right to sleep.
- Good.
Sorry to have a ruckus like this in front of you ladies... but Dave's an ornery old cuss when he gets going.
Too drunk to drive on, I'm afraid.
Don't worry, ma'am.
Bob here will take you on in.
He knows every inch of the road, don't you?
- You bet.
- I'm driving.
But if anything was to happen to the ladies, I'd feel to blame.
Don't.
Señor.
- Did they do it?
- They hit him with a pistola.
His friends, eh?
What happened this time?
- Bumped his head.
- Where? On Iron Mountain?
Where's the best chance of a cheap room?
Cap's place across the street, the Sunup Saloon.
- Saloon?
- Saloon.
- Where's the hotel?
- Up the street a piece, lady.
Are we expected to carry our bags this time of night?
- Do you want to drive them on up?
- Nope.
I'll pick up my saddle tomorrow.
Well?
Hey, Doc, customer.
Take my hand, Shorty.
What happened here?
- Bumped his head.
- So I see.
Looks like he's going to need a couple or so stitches.
You better get him up to a room.
I'll get a key.
- Book me for one, too.
- I'll help you with him.
He'll be all right.
How about a little snort?
- Don't mind if I do.
- Come along.
- Will he make it?
- Sure he'll make it.
You can't kill off an old jug-wallow like Dave that easy.
You're right.
I reckon Saint Peter's getting mighty weary... dusting off that doormat for him.
- What'll you have?
- Whisky.
Same.
- By the way, how'd you say it happened?
- I didn't.
That's right. You didn't.
The reason I ask, there were a couple of fellas in here... that said that Dave was kicking up quite a ruckus up at Stan's place.
Sheriff Jackson it was, and Bob Clews.
Tough customers, those Clews boys.
It don't pay to start nothing with them you don't intend to finish.
No.
Say, Doc, they tell me
George is getting out again.
Yes! That's Bob Clews' brother.
Just did a stretch in the penitentiary for horse stealing.
They string them up for that where I come from.
Too bad they didn't string Clews up while they were about it.
- Here's how.
- Mud.
That's a good hand.
What did I tell you?
They got to be big to beat me.
Clint Harolday's luck is good tonight, huh?
They're certainly running for him.
It's about time.
He's taken a beating this last week that would shake a better man.
Include me out.
- Come on. Can't you take it?
- Not with that kind of luck, I can't.
Besides, I only sat in to oblige.
Come on, Doc.
I still got to take something from you.
No more tonight, son.
How about you, sir? Care to sit in?
I must warn you that our young friend here... is holding phenomenal cards.
- Don't mind if I do.
- That's fine.
- This is Pat Fosler.
- How are you?
- Ab Jenkins.
- How are you?
Shorty Davis, and Clint Harolday.
My name is Garvey. Judge Garvey, sir.
I don't believe I got yours.
- Rocklin.
- How do you do, sir? Please sit down.
Anybody got any change?
You won't need any change in this game, mister.
- I'll let you have some, sir.
- Deal, Ab.
I'm up.
Your bet.
It's open for $3.
- I'm out.
- Raise you $20.
- I'm out.
- Beats me.
Call you for $6.
Dig.
- Table stakes, Clint.
- Not if he wants to dig.
Got you beat.
- Cards?
- One.
One for me.
That queen is dead.
- Or I can take it if I want it.
- Sure, if you want... but you got to beat my hand with four cards.
I'm playing these, mister.
I'm not setting in.
Why don't you boys split the pot?
I'm not splitting. I'm betting.
You calling?
Nope.
I'm raising.
Dig.
Let me have some money.
You're in deep enough already, Clint.
I have called for all I've got.
Full house.
Kings up win. That third queen is dead.
Mister, get away from that table and get out of here.
Maybe from now on you'll know... a full house beats two pairs, you four-flusher.
He wasn't armed, Clint.
I don't like to tell men how to play cards when I'm not sitting in... but maybe I ought to have spoken up.
That queen was dead, Clint, and you know it.
When anybody plays poker with me, they play my game or not at all.
If I was you, I'd hightail it out of here before he comes back.
- Comes back.
- He's the kind.
I've come for my money.
Sure.
I guess I was wrong about that queen.
Cap's an old gambler, and he says you were right all the time.
I'm willing to take Cap's word for it because, as I said, he...
Good night, gentlemen.
Funny thing about that card.
Why, if I'd known for sure it was dead like Cap said...
He's gone to bed, Clint.
Who are you?
- How are you feeling?
- Fine.
Indigestion?
Yeah.
Nice place you got here.
This isn't my place. It's the Sunup Saloon.
Saloon?
Saloon.
See you later.
Saloon.
I knocked, but I guess you didn't hear me.
What do you want?
Looks like you kind of stirred things up around here last night, stranger.
- Is that what you came to say?
- Nope. Got a message for you.
Somebody wants to see you out front.
Who?
Why don't you go down and find out?
I will.
- What's going on over there?
- Arly Harolday's on the warpath.
I just talked to him.
He ought to be down any minute.
Here he comes now. Watch the fun.
- Your name Rocklin?
- Yes, ma'am.
You took some money from my brother last night.
- Did I?
- You took it at the point of a gun... and I'm taking it back the same way.
- You're Arly Harolday.
- Dig!
I was told to say that your saddle isn't ready yet.
Stop!
Stop or I'll kill you!
Turn around. Turn around!
Whisky.
You lied to me, didn't you?
Don't think I'll forget this, making a fool of me... in front of the whole town.
I'll see you at the ranch.
Was that a close shave.
Why, she'd just as soon hit you as miss you.
You don't know how lucky you were, son.
Why do you think I need this?
Say, that was the funniest thing
I ever saw.
That Arly is madder than a loco heifer.
- You sure get the...
- Get out of here!
You broke it!
That calls for one on the house.
Come on. Come in here.
Who handled Red Cardell's business?
- Judge Garvey.
- Know where I could find him?
He rooms behind his office across the street over there.
He doesn't usually raise the blinds, though, until about noon.
- See you later.
- Thanks.
Boy, has somebody come to town.
Come in.
Mr. Rocklin, good morning.
Come in, sir. Come right in.
That was quite a poker game we had last night, wasn't it?
- Yes.
- Excuse me. I'll get my coat.
Yes, sir, that was quite a little poker game.
What can I do for you, sir?
I understand you were
Red Cardell's lawyer.
- I was. Yes, that's right.
- You know anything about this?
"Dear Rocklin, glad you have made up your mind to come.
"Enclosed find train fare and $150 advance on your wages."
I don't quite understand.
I don't know why Red should have wanted to hire you.
Why not?
I don't know.
It's true that he did a lot of peculiar things... but I don't know where he could have used you.
Of course, if you'd like to go on as an extra hand...
Excuse me.
- Good morning, ladies.
- Judge Garvey, I presume?
- Yes, and you are?
- I'm Miss Martin.
- This is my niece Clara Cardell.
- How do you do?
Come in, please, and sit down.
You arrived at a very opportune moment, madam.
As the new owner of the KC Ranch,
I'm sure you'll be interested to know... that this gentleman claims to have a letter...
"Claims to have"? You read it, didn't you?
Has a letter, shall we say, then, from the late Mr. Cardell... engaging him to work on the KC.
You can't hold us to account for every promise made by that man.
Everybody knows he wasn't responsible for his actions half the time.
And if you think I'd have you work on the ranch in any capacity...
Lady, I'd rather walk for somebody else than ride for you.
What impudence!
The only reason I came here today... was to pay back the $150
Red Cardell sent in advance.
- No.
- Don't interfere, Clara.
Of course he must pay it back.
As far as the railroad fare is concerned...
I reckon we can check that off to time lost, call it quits.
But, mister, I...
- I'm sorry. I don't know your name.
- Rocklin, miss.
It isn't fair for you to pay anything back.
I'd prefer it that way, if you don't mind.
I have a message for you.
- About what?
- Wait a minute.
I just heard they let George Clews out of the penitentiary... and you can tell him if he sets foot on the Topaz Ranch...
I'll shoot him on sight.
But, Miss Arly, I don't know why you should... want to deliver your message through me.
- You have mutual friends.
- lf you're referring to Sheriff Jackson...
- I am.
- But that's absurd, Miss Arly.
The fact that he employs one of Clews brothers... doesn't make the other his friend.
Have it your own way, but warn him.
I mean it.
Miss Harolday, this is Miss Cardell.
- How do you do?
- Hello.
And Miss Martin, her aunt.
- Hello.
- How do you do?
I think you should know each other, seeing that you're going to be neighbors.
Miss Harolday runs the Topaz Ranch for her stepfather.
She's a famous horsewoman in these parts.
I saw you ride into town this morning.
You looked lovely.
Yes?
Harolday wants to see you down at his office.
What about?
He's got a proposition to make about riding for him.
- $60 a month.
- That's foreman's wages.
I wouldn't give you a red cent, but it's his money.
The way things are shaping up around the ranch... maybe we could do with somebody as mean as you.
I warn you, Miss Harolday, you're making a great mistake.
Do you want the job?
Lead the way.
Why did you have to say that?
I simply don't understand you.
But I understand you.
You should be ashamed, throwing yourself at a man like that.
Why, I...
- You must excuse her. She's young.
- And inexperienced.
Young people must be protected from themselves at times.
- Don't you agree?
- Exactly.
- He following you?
- Not following me. He's with me.
He's always with me.
- Just an old friend.
- Best friend I've got.
Wait here.
I just hired a man named Rocklin, said you made me do it.
$60, and he'll earn it, while he lasts.
Arly, you know we don't need any more help.
- Why did you do it?
- So I can fire him.
I hate him.
Clint and he quarreled last night.
Clint lied about it... and I made a fool of myself.
- He's outside.
- Arly, wait.
Come in.
- Howdy.
- Howdy.
Mr. Rocklin, what happened between you and my stepson last night?
Poker.
About this suggestion, you working for me...
- It was your suggestion, not mine.
- Yes, that's right.
$60 is big money.
- lf you've changed your mind, l...
- No. Wait a minute.
I take it you've had the experience.
- Enough for Red Cardell to hire me.
- Red Cardell hired you?
Yes, but I won't ride for the new owner, so it leaves me open.
I see. Were you a friend of Red's?
Nope.
Rock, George Clews is in town.
He seen what you done to Bob and he's looking for you.
Tell him I'll be outside in the street in front of the saloon.
Yeah.
Get them children out of here.
Get out, Joe. There's going to be trouble.
Clear the street! Hurry up, everybody!
I'm gonna get his ears.
You, George Clews.
Rocklin said if you don't come out, he's coming in here to tear you apart.
That was my beer, you know?
If he comes in again, I'll throw you.
- I'm gonna get his ears.
- His ears are outside.
- Come on.
- How about those drinks?
Pay him.
Pardon me, ladies.
Would you mind stepping inside?
Inside? Why?
- I think it might be safer.
- Safer?
Touch that gun and I'll kill you.
Did you want to see me?
Why, you...
I saw you! I saw you strike that poor man!
Yes, ma'am, just as hard as I could.
Hey, you. What you been up to?
I just laid the gun barrel across the head of a drunk friend of yours... like you did yesterday.
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You're a liar.
You look here, young fella.
You keep on talking like that... and you'll find yourself in a heap of trouble.
Don't say you ain't been warned!
- Say, that was...
- What were you saying about Cardell?
You being hired by Red Cardell only confirms what I'd suspected.
- He was getting ready to fight.
- Fight? Who?
Organized rustling.
At least, that's my belief.
Red was no friend of mine.
He was too fond of... taking the law into his own hands.
But he had my sympathy.
He'd been harder hit than any of us.
To top it all, he lost his foreman.
You mean he quit on him?
No. He was shot.
Shot in the back by a bullet... from the same caliber rifle as got Red.
Got any ideas?
No, except the man you just pistol-whipped is in on it somewhere.
It's a pity you didn't kill him when you had the chance.
Say, it doesn't sound like it's going to be so easy... on those women at the KC.
Want to go back and work for them?
Nope.
And I'm not jumping at this offer of yours, either...
'cause I don't hold with working for women.
You mean my stepdaughter?
Don't worry. She won't interfere with you.
Rocklin, I figure we've been losing cattle over a place called Tabletop.
It's the back way into the Topaz Ranch and a perfect route for rustlers.
I'm going to send you up to the line camp.
Don't mind working a Ione hand, do you?
- I like working that way.
- Good. How soon can you move out?
As soon as I can get my gear together.
You bring it here, and I'll see it gets up to the ranch.
Fine.
Now, Pat, I'm giving you first call on my services.
There's a lot of other folks looking for a good man, too, you know?
So if you want me, better hurry and speak up.
I ain't got no time to...
Excuse me. I'll be right back to find out when to start.
Where you heading for?
- Riding for the Topaz.
- What?
- Have you gone plumb loco?
- It's good money.
There ain't money enough to make it worthwhile... to work for that woman.
When she gets going, she can be meaner than a skillet full of rattlesnakes.
She ain't gonna forget the way you made a fool out of her... in front of the whole town.
- Dave!
- Yeah, I'll be right there.
- It's poison, that's what it is. Just plain...
- Dave!
What do you want to hang around here for anyhow?
$60 a month.
Be right with you.
- How do you do, Mr. Rocklin?
- Howdy.
It's a lovely afternoon, isn't it?
I reckon it is pretty nice.
- So you're moving in on the KC?
- Not exactly moving in.
- You see, we're...
- Clara, do you have to discuss... our private affairs with every ragtag and bobtail cow person we meet?
Just passing the time of day, ma'am.
We can do very well without it, thank you.
Besides, you're keeping your lady friend waiting.
I thought maybe you'd changed your mind again.
Nope.
Tala will show you the bunkhouse.
I'll talk to you about your duties in the morning.
How far is it to the line camp at Tabletop?
10, 15 mile.
I'll be moving up there first thing in the morning.
Harolday's orders.
Care to show me the way?
I will show you.
The trail is straight ahead.
You'll find everything you need in the cabin at the top.
Tala, it appears you don't like me.
- That's right. I do not.
- Why?
Permit that I offer you a cigarette.
Thanks.
It is not your fault that your shadow is black.
But you will only bring unhappiness to my Arlita.
I do not blame you... but I feel I must hate you.
- Hi, there.
- I see you found a new job.
Yeah. I haul freight for old Pat Fosler.
Got a letter here for that crazy galoot Rocklin... from that little Cardell gal.
You know, she seems to be mighty took up about something.
Made me promise to deliver it personal.
- But Rocklin is not here.
- You ain't telling me he's quit already?
- He's on the way to Tabletop.
- Doggone it!
And I've got a whole load of stuff to deliver to Gopher Flats.
Maybe you can take the old road to Tabletop?
- Is it still open?
- Yes, I think so.
Here I go, then. So long.
Have you seen Arly?
No, sir, I didn't see Miss Arly today but I seed her last night... and she sure was mad.
Plenty mad.
Morning, Clint.
You must be feeling pretty good this morning.
Say, Arly, about that poker game night before last...
- Forget it.
- Forget it?
Tala!
- Well?
- Say, what is this?
- What do you mean?
- What do I mean?
Good morning, Arlita.
Good morning, Tala.
You have made yourself very pretty today.
See what I mean?
Have my horse saddled and sent around right away, will you?
And have that Rocklin bring it.
Well? What are you grinning at?
Rocklin is not here.
He quit?
- He has gone to the line camp at Tabletop.
- What?
It was Mr. Harolday's orders.
Why do you make your heart heavy with thoughts of him, little one?
- He's not for you.
- Be quiet.
He has made the choice, Arlita.
With your own eyes, you saw it yesterday.
And she, too, has opened her heart to him.
Already she has summoned him to her.
What do you mean?
Dave of the white beard carries a letter to Rocklin. It is from her.
How did you know that?
I met Dave, and he tell me.
So now he rides to Tabletop.
- Little one, why don't...
- Leave me...
Good morning, Arly. Good morning, Tala.
Say, fetch my briefcase, will you?
It's on the desk.
Get it.
Looks like we're getting that land we were wanting along the river bottom.
I bought the mortgage on the Hardman ranch.
It's due today. I'm on my way over there now.
Did you send that Rocklin to Tabletop?
- Why, yes, I did.
- Let's get things straight.
This place was my mother's, now it's mine and Clint's.
You've helped out, but the way things are going... we'll be able to pay you back every penny we owe.
Meanwhile, I'm running this outfit, and I expect to give the orders.
You generally do.
Why did you send Rocklin to Tabletop?
It seemed like a good idea, what with all this rustling going on.
Who'd be driving cattle over Tabletop unless they were crazy?
Now, I don't agree with you.
At any rate, if you must have it...
I'd no intention of engaging a man at foreman's wages... just to gratify the whims of a jealous woman.
You take care what you're saying.
No, it's you who should take care, my dear.
There's one man that you can't rawhide into jumping the way you want.
You made a fool of yourself over him once.
You better watch out you don't do it again.
Thanks, Tala.
Darn funny, that storm quitting about the time I get here.
No funnier than you slogging through, to deliver a letter from a woman.
The older I get, the dumber I get.
When we gonna get around to reading it?
Thought I'd wait till morning.
Might be bad news, and I wouldn't be able to sleep.
"Dear Mr. Rocklin...
"forgive me if this letter seems a trifle incoherent...
"but I am terribly worried and unhappy."
Who wouldn't be, living with that old screech owl?
Go ahead, go ahead. I can't read anyhow.
"I am desperately in need of help and advice...
"from someone whom I feel I can trust.
"I heartily dislike and distrust
Judge Garvey."
Smart gal.
"But my aunt seems to have suddenly revised her opinion of him...
"and now wants me to place all my affairs in the Judge's hands and return east.
"Such is certainly not my wish."
Kind of looks like she's formed an attachment.
For the locality, I mean.
"I wanted so much to give ranch life a trial...
"but fear circumstances are against me.
"Especially in view of the recent Indian trouble."
Indian trouble? Why, there isn't been no Indian trouble around here...
You want to hear the rest of this?
Might as well. Come this far.
"I want to apologize for what took place this afternoon...
"and I am returning the $150...
"because I feel it is rightfully yours.
"You must take it.
Faithfully yours, Clara Cardell."
Well, what do you make of it?
Somebody's sure busting to get her off the ranch.
Indian trouble.
Got to admit, though,
I feel a mite sorry for that young 'un.
Nice little tyke.
Too nice for this country.
She sure is a pretty little thing.
Dave, what do you know about Garvey and Cardell?
Cardell? Salt of the earth.
Cantankerous old cuss, but a real tall man, believe me.
He was a big feller, tall in the saddle, like yourself.
Fact is, you could pass for blood relation, come to think of it.
- Were Red and the Judge friends?
- Yeah, that's what you'd say.
They were regular drinking partners, played poker together most nights.
Red always got the worst of it.
Red was a gambler.
Oh, yeah. A mighty poor one, I reckon.
Still, you'd have to say him and Garvey were friends.
Anything ever happen to make you think they weren't?
Rock, I'm going to tell you something
I ain't told nobody before.
Sure you can trust me?
Last time I seen old Red was the day he died.
It was in town.
He just come out of the stage office.
Tried to book passage for Garden City, but couldn't on account of I had a full load.
Sir, he took me aside and read me a printed piece of paper.
It was from one of them
Chicago sporting firms... explaining how to manipulate trick playing cards.
- Marked cards.
- Yeah.
Seemed Red found the cards and this paper... in the pocket of a coat he borrowed from a friend once.
- Whose coat was it?
- Now, that's just what I asked.
All he said was it belonged to a good friend.
He said he wasn't waiting for the next stage... but riding over to see the district judge about it alone.
And that's when they got him?
Yeah. Just a mile or so from Stan's place.
A bullet in his back, pockets empty.
How come you never told anybody before?
Who was I going to tell? Sheriff Jackson?
How about what's-his-name, Harolday?
He's no friend of Garvey's, is he?
Hates his guts.
Sure riles him to see young Clint hanging on the Judge's coattails.
All the same, I decided to keep my mouth shut and my eyes open.
Even if it was Garvey that Red was talking about... don't follow that he killed him.
No. General opinion is, it was rustlers.
You all right?
Doggone it! I will be if I ever get dry.
- Hey, Look at that!
- Get down!
Jumping Jeremiah! Look at that!
Come on.
My team.
That's not your team. Come on.
You can't run him down afoot!
Maybe he'll double back.
Not bad shooting.
You think I did that?
Cutting it mighty close, though.
Good thing I haven't got brains enough to fill it.
It's too bad you had to come up here through that storm for nothing.
I haven't minded a bit... because I came up here to fire you!
I see.
Harolday does the hiring... and you do the firing.
I own the Topaz, not Harolday.
Now get out of here and don't ever come back!
Mind if I wait for Dave?
He'll be along any minute.
Be funny if he winged that shadow of yours.
If you mean Tala, you're loco.
He's not even up here.
You came up alone?
Yes.
Then who was that we took out after?
Whoever shot at you.
- Who was it?
- I don't know.
- You mean you won't tell.
- I mean I don't know!
Why should I lie to you?
Reckon you forgot something.
You just fired me.
Rock, he got away, but guess... what.
You guess.
For a man that's got a despise for women, you sure do get all snaggled up with them.
- You work for Harolday?
- Yes.
Here's one of his horses.
That's my saddle. I'll pick it up in a minute.
Howdy.
I thought I sent you up to Tabletop.
- That's right.
- What happened?
This, for one thing.
I told you, you should've killed him when you had the chance.
Clews?
What's the matter?
Don't you think it was him?
Well, I've been figuring... and it don't seem reasonable... that Clews was in a condition to take that sort of a chance alone.
Besides, how would he have known
I was up there that soon?
George Clews is not the only one
I've run contrariwise to in this town.
There's that shadow of your stepdaughter's, for instance.
Tala?
Then there's... him.
Hello, Clint.
I just heard that Rocklin was...
- Was what?
- Was shot at last night.
Yeah, Mr. Rocklin was just telling me all about it.
You haven't any idea who might have done it, have you?
Not me.
You ain't trying to pin it on me?
Because if you are, you're in for a big disappointment.
I was over at the Sunup... playing poker with the Judge and the boys till early morning.
If you don't believe me, ask for yourself.
I believe you.
But that don't mean you couldn't tell a thing or two as would help... if you wanted.
- What do you mean?
- Yeah, what would Clint know about it?
How about this?
Ever see it before?
Go on, speak up.
Did you ever see it before?
No, of course I didn't.
Quit riding me. I don't know, I tell you!
Just because I had a run-in with you over a game of cards... that don't mean I'd sneak up on you in the dark and...
By the way...
I was fired last night... by the boss.
Clint, I don't know what I'm going to do with you.
You cause me nothing but trouble.
The way you lied about that pouch wouldn't have deceived a 6-year-old.
- I was...
- My advice to you... is to get out of town for a while, till this thing blows over.
You'll find some money in my safe at the ranch.
Take what you need, and put the key back in the desk drawer. Go ahead.
Mr. Rocklin, I'm so glad I found you.
I feel perfectly awful running after you like this, but l...
You got troubles?
Come on in.
It's all right.
- Now, what is it?
- My aunt found out I wrote you.
She made a terrible scene.
You haven't signed everything over to that Garvey, have you?
No, but because I refused... she said she's sign an affidavit saying I'm still underage.
And as my guardian, she can do whatever she likes.
You got anything to prove you're not underage?
Mr. Garvey has a letter that will prove it.
My aunt wrote it before we came out here.
You suppose we could get it?
He'd never give it to me.
- Wait here.
- Please, you...
You won't go getting yourself into trouble, will you?
I mean, I'd rather give up everything than...
That takes care of that.
All we have to do is make the affidavit... and everything will be just as we want it.
I certainly hope so. Of course, it's not myself I'm concerned about.
Of course. Now, let me see...
"I, Elizabeth..."
Mr. Rocklin, this is indeed a surprise.
I understood you were riding for the Topaz.
That's right.
Miss Martin, perhaps we can finish our business at some later date.
Would you excuse us, please?
I came for that letter.
- Letter?
- The one Miss Martin wrote... from back east, saying the girl was of age, remember?
No, I don't believe I do.
Mr. Rocklin, let me ask you a question.
Just what is your interest in this letter?
My only interest is getting it.
You realize what this is, don't you?
It's robbery.
Armed robbery, at that.
I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed.
Yours?
- Open up.
- There's nothing there that concerns you.
I'd like to make up my own mind about that.
All right, I'll open it, just to convince you that I'm not hiding any letter.
- What's the idea?
- These cards.
Is there anything unusual about a man having a deck of cards in his possession?
Depends on what kind they are.
Especially when they're under lock and key.
- You're taking them with you, I presume.
- That's right.
- Now you look here...
- You're the one that better start looking... for a way out for killing Red Cardell.
Red Cardell?
He found out about these and you killed him.
And you believe a story like that?
I will till I hear a better one.
The district judge at Garden City might be very interested in these.
Give me a hand here, boys.
Say, looks like you two had a little disagreement.
- He isn't dead, is he?
- Not permanently, I don't reckon.
- What happened, anyway?
- Nothing! Nothing at all!
You must have found out something.
Come on.
- What's the matter? Are you hurt?
- Shut up!
Don't you talk to me like that!
I'll have you...
Find out who owns that tobacco pouch yet?
Nope, but get Clint Harolday.
- Clint? Is he in on it?
- I don't know, but get him.
Bring him up to my room.
Yeah!
So now you know the truth.
Think you can steal him away from me, you're welcome to try it.
Did you get it?
Nope, but I don't think it matters much.
You go on back to the KC, and I'll come out in the morning... pick you up and take you over to Garden City.
I hate putting you to that trouble.
It's nothing at all. I'm going there anyway.
You look like you've been fighting.
What are you doing here?
I was just telling Miss Cardell... about you and me.
What about you and me?
- I think I'd better be going.
- Just a minute.
What all has she been telling you?
Really, I'd rather not.
Go ahead. Tell him.
And I dare him to deny it.
Deny what?
That she was with you last night in the cabin in the mountains.
Why should I deny it?
- Didn't you make love to me?
- Make love?
You didn't kiss me, I suppose.
Do you expect me to deny that, too?
You see?
Maybe you ought to hear what I have to say.
Please, you needn't explain.
After all, it isn't any of my business, is it?
- Why, you little...
- That's right. Start swearing.
Just like a man.
If there wasn't a lady here,
I'd do more to you than swear.
Mr. Rocklin, I can't thank you enough for trying to help me, and I...
I really appreciate it ever so much.
She's lovely, isn't she? So sweet, honest... but helpless.
It's a pity you didn't fall in love with her instead of me.
You might as well know right now... that no woman is going to get me hogtied and branded.
Don't be so sure.
I don't think I'm doing so badly.
Don't you?
Don't you know?
I know there isn't anything you wouldn't do to get what you want.
I always get what I want.
See? Bye.
Whatever is to become of you?
Have you no pride, decency?
Throwing yourself at that wretch like any shameless hussy.
I thought we were done with him... but, no, you had to run and tell him all about our business.
Don't you dare deny it.
You know very well you told him about that letter I wrote to Mr. Garvey.
Didn't you?
Tell Miss Martin
I'll take care of everything.
You'll take care of everything.
Get down. Tie them up.
All right.
Come in.
Get in. Get in.
Here he is, Rock.
Caught him just in time near the Topaz.
Heading for out, I'd say. Here's his gun.
How about you going down and having one on me?
Tell Cap to charge it.
Yeah.
But if you need me, holler.
What's this all about?
Now, there's no use you getting all het up and excited, kid.
I just want to ask you a few questions.
Sit down.
I told you, I don't know who owns that pouch... and I don't know who shot at you.
Forget it. That's not what
I wanted to talk to you about anyway.
What do you want to talk about?
Come on! Get it over with!
Clint, I want you to tell me why Garvey murdered Red Cardell.
- You know, don't you?
- Me? No.
You do, and you're going to tell me all about it.
I don't know anything about it!
- Talk.
- I don't know anything!
I would...
Look at this. Where's Doc Riley?
What's the matter? What is it?
Somebody better fetch Harolday.
Better get Arly, too.
- She was over at the hotel.
- I'll get her.
What's going on? Gangway.
Here, what's the trouble?
And I warned you, didn't I?
Guess that's the last trouble you'll cause in this town.
- Hand over that gun.
- Now, just a minute.
I know it looks bad, but I didn't kill the kid.
I believe you.
When I come in, his gun was laying right over there...
No, it wasn't. It was right here in my hand, like it is now.
Yeah, if you didn't kill him, then who did?
I don't know, but I'm going to find out.
Where's my boy?
- I didn't do it, Harolday.
- Who did, then?
He had a gun in his hand when we came in.
Bet it's the same one that killed Clint.
What do you say to that?
- He's right.
- You admit it.
That still doesn't say I did it.
- Why'd you do it?
- I didn't.
He admits it was his gun that shot him.
But you didn't fire it?
That's right.
- What happened?
- Clint and I were having a little argument.
What about?
About whether he was going to help clear up a few things... that have been bothering me and some other folks around here.
Who killed Red Cardell, for instance.
- Cardell?
- And the KC foreman... and who it was took that shot at me at Tabletop last night... and why certain people are so anxious to get rid of that Cardell girl.
How would Clint know about all that?
He's lying. He's covering up for killing my boy.
Don't be a fool. You know you can't get away with a yarn like that.
Why don't you save yourself and everyone else some trouble... and just surrender to the Sheriff here?
After all, it's not a crime in these parts to shoot a man in self-defense.
- Self-defense?
- Yes.
Everybody knows how Clint was.
He probably lost his head and pulled a gun like he did that night in the poker game.
Wasn't that it?
No, that wasn't it... and until I do what I've got to do,
I'm not surrendering to anybody.
I wouldn't exactly care to be shot in the back... in a framed-up jailbreak.
If someone was going to kill you, why didn't they do it just now?
Why'd they have to kill Clint?
I don't know, unless they wanted to get Clint, too.
See, doing it this way, they get us both.
Clint first and me afterwards, just like I said.
Quit the fancy talk. Who's they?
I might be able to answer that for you later.
No, you won't, because you're coming along with me.
Am I? Get back.
After him!
Sheriff, you ought to be congratulated.
Look, Mr. Harolday, you seen what happened.
Let's go to Garden City, that's where he's headed.
- Are you sure?
- I'm positive.
Come on.
You are crying, Arlita.
There is no need to cry.
Rocklin did not kill your brother.
I saw it all.
Then why didn't you tell?
Who was it?
You will know him when you see me kill him.
Want I should spell you awhile?
Doggone you. I might have known you'd do something like this.
- What are we doing?
- Heading for the KC.
For the KC? Isn't that a little like hanging yourself?
You better get out of this country fast,
I'm thinking.
- I'll do the thinking.
- Yeah.
Name is Clews, ma'am.
Mr. Garvey sent us out.
Said you were expecting trouble with that Rocklin.
I am. I'm wondering if you're up to it.
I notice you didn't fare so well with him yesterday.
- He was drunk.
- Yeah, but I'm sober now.
See that you stay that way.
Don't worry, ma'am. I'm just waiting to get even with that saddle tramp.
We'll be close by.
Yes, ma'am.
See anybody riding hard for Garden City?
Been on the road all night.
Ain't seen a living soul.
Probably took the cutoff through Jawbone Canyon.
After that storm, he won't make it.
Only one other place he could've gone.
That's KC.
- You think so?
- I'm positive.
- That's what you said before.
- To the KC, men!
- Take me through the canyon.
- It is dangerous, Arlita.
- We've got to beat them to the KC.
- It is dangerous.
I will go through from here alone.
We're going through together.
Hey, George. George, get up.
You ungrateful thing, running away like a deceitful sneak thief.
Yes, I'm running away, and it's all your fault.
You're been deceitful and sneaking.
Don't think I don't know your intensions.
Don't think I don't know your intentions.
I don't care! Nothing you can say or do is going to stop me.
You little fool, you go to Garden City with that man and you'll lose everything.
But why? Why are you being so evasive?
If you know, why don't you tell me?
All right, I'll tell you.
Rocklin is the nephew of the late Mr. Cardell.
As next of kin, he stands to get everything... because you're not Cardell's niece, you're only his grandniece.
Rocklin turned up unexpectedly.
- You and Mr. Garvey knew the truth?
- Yes!
And you knowed the truth all the time, too, didn't you?
No wonder you stuck around.
Well, of all the...
I'll take care of her.
Come on.
I heard one of them tell my aunt not to worry... that he was just as anxious as she was to get even with you.
It's the only way I can handle her.
The Clews are around here someplace.
Garvey sent them.
You bet we're around.
Untie her.
Now tie him up.
I'll take part in this, you hairy beast.
And here's something I owe you.
Help me get her on the bed.
Take those two to Mr. Garvey, tell him I want to see him at once.
Put them in the wagon and get our horses.
We'll dump him in the Judge's lap.
- Hadn't we better tie him, too?
- Get some rope.
Get rid of those guns.
- What's the matter, Arly?
- Get rid of them!
Now get down off that wagon.
Look, Arly...
Better get out of here as fast as you can.
They're headed this way.
Where'd you get this?
That belongs to the man that took that a shot at me on Tabletop.
Dave found it.
Cut him loose.
Put that gun away.
We got to stop him.
He's got to get away. Get the team!
Rocklin, you got to get out of here!
Do something. If you can!
Doggone it, Rock! I'm on your side!
Then, come on. Let's get the Cardell girl.
You haven't time. They're coming.
Don't you believe me?
- Go get him.
- He's as stubborn as an old mule.
You're putting a rope around your neck!
Mine, too, maybe.
Get him out of sight and follow me.
- What will we do with the old lady?
- Do whatever you like.
I'd like to poison her.
Come on.
Howdy, ma'am. Sorry to bother you...
Mr. Garvey, I'm so glad you're here.
The most awful...
- What are all those men doing here?
- We're looking for Rocklin.
- Has he been here?
- Yes, here and gone.
- What?
- Gone?
Yes. The two men you sent took him and that old man back to town.
- The Clews?
- Funny, we didn't see them.
- Something must have gone wrong.
- For once, I agree.
Let's fan out and see what's going on.
Don't leave, Mr. Garvey. I want to talk to you privately. It's important.
We'd better go ahead and meet you in town.
Possibly that would be better.
I'll see you in town later, Sheriff.
- We'll leave your horse here for you.
- Thank you.
Tie Garvey's horse up.
You're positive he knows everything?
Absolutely everything!
He was standing right at the window.
If you were to ask me...
I'm not asking you, and stop bothering me with your silly little questions.
We've got to do something else besides talk.
You have to do something.
This was all your idea, remember?
My idea? That's all you know about it.
If there's anybody else in on it,
Judge, speak up.
Well, I do declare!
Talk.
- Why, l...
- Not you!
You ever see this before?
Drop that gun!
No, Judge.
He was just getting ready to finish you off through that window.
You seem to like to do business through windows, Harolday.
You didn't shoot Clint, by any chance?
By one bad chance. Tala saw him do it, and that pouch is his.
Tala made it for him a long time ago when he made his own, didn't you?
Why did you kill Red Cardell?
Harolday wanted the KC the same as he wanted the Topaz... and the Hardman place for his land scheme.
He planned on breaking up the ranches... into smaller holdings and selling them to dirt farmers.
He pretended to be on the outs with me... so that I could gain the confidence of Cardell.
Then, of course, when Red caught me... with that deck of marked cards and threatened to expose me...
Harolday shot him.
Why did he kill Clint?
It was an accident.
That shot was meant for you.
You see, we knew who you were.
We even tried to locate you... not to inform you of your legacy, but to eliminate you.
Naturally, when you arrived here in town... and without any knowledge of your relationship to Cardell... it seemed you were playing right into our hands.
I was hoping you'd think so.
Harolday intended to kill you at Tabletop.
Once you were out of the way, it was our intention... to have me handle the business affairs of the women.
And do us out of everything!
It would have been much simpler.
Everything would have been...
You vile, wicked, despicable...
When he wakes up, we'll have to get everything put on paper.
And you'll have to do the putting, because I can't write.
I think Auntie's out of her mind.
She's in her room laughing.
What that old pelican needs is a good spanking.
I bet you're just the one that can do it.
Yeah, I believe I am.
I know I am.
I guess there's no hurry for you to get to Garden City now.
No, I...
I don't suppose there's any rush.
If I were like her, I'd stay in the west.
Does that mean you're going back east,
Cousin Clara?
It's where I belong. I know that now.
I reckon it's good to know where you belong.
Wish I knew.
I can tell you.
Hey, Rock!
Rock, where are you?
English
Before 1877, southwest Texas was pouring cattle northward...
...over the newly opened Chisholm Trail.
The Texans of the open range could see wealth and power just ahead.
But this is the year of the great breakup.
The outlaws of the wide open West have learned how easy it is...
...to raid the lonely herds.
In this country, where the ranch houses are 20 miles apart...
...the thieves hit hard and often, stampeding the wild cattle.
Rustlers gather from the length of the frontier for the easy kill...
...and the range is without defense.
Night after night, they drive the cattle off by hundreds that mount into thousands.
And the vast herds are melting away, ruining the men who built Texas.
The outnumbered ranchers have fought back...
...but the savage range war has smashed their leaders...
...and driven them into exile across the Mexican line.
Only a few men like Charlie Bell of San Antonio...
...still keep the banished fighters posted...
...hoping against hope that the great days can be brought back.
Maybe a peace officer.
- I'm Charlie Bell of San Antonio.
- You have pass?
The border is closed, señor.
Is new order.
Look here, you people.
I can go and wade the river a mile below here without any trouble.
But I don't mean to do anything of the kind.
If you try to cross, there is nothing what we can do but try to stop you.
It is not our fault if your law breaks down so your best men come live with us.
We will have peace in Mexico, even if every day we must fight.
Clay Hardin is in Nuevo Laredo and I mean to see him.
Other men have come after him before.
It only means more fight.
I know all that, but I'm Clay Hardin's best friend.
Then you know he is going back to Texas.
You can see him then.
If you wanna save his life, you'd better let me see him now.
- Go on in.
Thanks.
He is gone. He's not here.
We never heard of him.
That horse is the horse of my husband.
Help! Help!
Juan, Jose, Rita, Rosita!
We're attacked. We're stricken.
A bad stranger is upon us.
Looking for someone?
I ought to take that thing and bend it over your head.
Ha, ha. You look like the time you sat on the cactus. How are you?
Ha, ha.
What's the matter with these people?
You could've saved yourself a long ride.
I wrote you I was coming home.
I guess you wrote other people. Everybody knows you're gonna make a try at it.
They do? Well, why burn up horseflesh coming all this way down here to tell me?
Clay, I rode to tell you not to come.
At least not now.
I love you
You're not ready to ride, Clay.
I never see a man shot up so bad as you was.
Be mine
Yahoo!
You think that's why
I stayed in Mexico, huh?
Oh, don't go back, Clay.
It ain't worth it.
All southwest Texas is busted.
San Antonio is just gonna be another dog town all falling down.
You're sweeter than any wine
That's just why I'm going back.
Now, you listen to me, Clay.
We've counted more than 5000 wanted outlaws loose in Texas.
They got a chain of stock thieves all along the border.
Them fellows can run a herd into Mexico every night.
Mexico can't help it, Charlie.
Us neither.
Look at the way we fought them.
You tied into them harder than anybody else. And what did it get us?
Your ranch burned out, your cows run off and yourself all shot to pieces.
Everybody knows who I blame for all that.
Clay, don't you see that's why you'll never get back to San Antonio?
You think Roy Stuart don't know you're after him?
I left Texas to find out something.
I found it. If Roy Stuart thinks
I'm coming after him now, he's right.
He's right about something else too.
The only way you'll get to San Antonio alive is to stay away.
- Can you get a bet on that?
- Anywhere in Texas.
The gamblers are making book in the streets.
Laredo's practically put up a grandstand and sold seats...
...to see you shot as you cross the line.
- Yeah?
Well, cover every cent you can get.
I'll pay it.
Don't run away, honey.
We won't look. Ha. Will we?
Now, listen, things got so bad up there, the governor asked for military aid.
Colonel Johnson's cavalry is policing San Antonio.
And the colonel himself swears he'll outlaw you the day you come back.
Yeah? Charlie?
Roy Stuart has gotta be convicted and hung.
You'll never get him that way, Clay.
I've got him now.
What do you think I've been doing down in Mexico?
We were whipped before because we lacked proof. We don't lack it now.
- Does Stuart know?
- Of course he does.
All the more reason it's sure death to cross over.
What do you want me to do?
Send somebody else?
All right, Clay. What's the next move?
Cross over into Laredo.
Get me seat on the San Antonio stage.
- In whose name?
- In my own name.
- What?
- Sure.
Onyx. He looks good.
How come you haven't lost him in a poker game by now?
Because I don't gamble the way you do.
Oh.
- Hi, boys.
- Hi, Charlie.
He wouldn't be here if Clay Hardin didn't aim to go through.
There'll be a fight if he tries to.
- You gonna put into it?
- Not me. But there's plenty as will.
Three-to-one, gents, 3-to-1
Clay Hardin never sets foot in San Antonio.
Place your bets with Honest Jay Witherspoon.
Never run out on a bet yet.
Or at least, with two exceptions, it was never proved.
- Three-to-one Clay never makes it.
- Why should Clay come back?
His cattle is scattered from Stinkwater to breakfast.
- Half his friends is dead, other is foolish.
- It's worse than you say.
But here's 100 that says he will be back.
Another 100 says it will be the best thing that happened to Texas.
Thank you, Mr. Streeter, I can use this.
Any more bets?
Three-to-one. Three-to-one.
Ain't that Lafe McWilliams?
Had all them gunfights in San Antone?
Sure is, brother.
Five-to-one. Make it 8-to-1.
Clay Hardin never makes San Antonio.
Get your money here, boys.
It's 8-to-1 here.
I got the signal.
Clay Hardin has left Nuevo.
- He may be over the Texas line by now.
- Well?
They lost him, he just disappeared.
We should've rode the river like the others.
Clay can't ride the brush 150 miles.
- There must be lead in him yet.
- That's right.
Even if he tried it, the lookouts would get him easy.
They can see a rider 20 miles as he comes through.
The Monterey coach is coming up.
Do you suppose he'd be fool enough...?
No.
Wait. That ain't the Monterey coach.
That's old Jaime Rosas driving.
That's a charter coach from below.
How do you do? How do you do?
- Oh, sit down.
Ha-ha-ha!
I don't sit down. Don't argue with me.
- Always the opposite.
- Oh.
One side. One side or a horn knocked off.
Scatter, you slickers.
No, no, no, go leave, please.
She don't see somebody now.
Nobody is talking to her without they don't see her first.
Now, wait a minute, my fat-headed friend.
Don't you ever take off your hat?
Of course not.
He needs it to shade his eyes.
Go keep an eye on Charlie Bell.
Real desperate character you got there riding with the driver.
That's my desperate manager.
See, I'm looking for a gentleman.
We haven't seen one in a year.
I'm sorry, ladies.
This is for your own protection.
Clay Hardin's on the loose, and he's a dangerous outlaw.
He's liable to smuggle himself through here.
Do you want to look under the pillows?
- Here.
- Hold on, will you?
No, no, no, inside is not.
You must be stay out.
What's that? You are stealing, I hope.
You right away steal those back.
Such thing begins, I don't know.
Please, make more careless.
If I break that, you sue me.
Ah, shut up!
Oh, sit down.
Come here.
Well, what do you want?
Charlie Bell bought a seat on the San Antonio stage for Clay Hardin.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I saw him do it myself.
Don't worry. I'll take care of that.
You'd better do something.
This stage never runs without a shotgun guard, you know that.
Clay's name is down and the company's gotta take him.
I don't gotta ride shotgun.
There's enough graveyard bait in the strongbox without Clay.
And I've got kids to support.
I didn't think them things was jackrabbits.
Maybe you wanna holler for the Army.
- The company reserves the right...
- I'll ride shotgun myself.
There's my bond.
San Antonio stage, get aboard.
It will roll without me.
I'm too young and good-looking for a one-way trip.
I can't do nothing. I just work here.
Even money, gents. Even money against Clay Hardin, and lucky to get it.
I don't see him.
What's the matter, is he afraid to show?
Maybe he invisible-ized himself.
Clay ain't here. He's changed his mind.
That's what he wants us to think.
He's circled the town already.
The stage will pick him up.
We might outrun the stage and wait at Cotulla.
Get into that coach.
You can get Clay easy when he comes out of the brush.
I'll tail the stage, and as you fire, I'll get Charlie Bell.
- What about my saddle?
- Move, or you won't need it anymore.
Here she rips.
Anybody change their mind?
- I'm going along. I'll settle my ticket later.
- Right.
- Go ahead, Charlie.
- Hyah, hyah, hyah!
Whoa!
Yippee! Yippee!
Well, hello.
Move over, honey.
Now, now, after all, Don Quickshot, the show doesn't start till after supper.
Oh, we're gonna have supper too?
Would you like to land on your head or get out peaceably?
Sorry, but I've planned on this ever since you left Monterey.
I don't like the society in those public coaches, do you?
If I scream, a man will come down here with a shotgun. And I'm going to scream.
- Now, wait, Henrietta.
- Let her go ahead.
I'll help you.
Look, look, look!
There goes an empty horse.
This is really for your own protection.
I'm sorry. We've heard that one.
No, on the level.
- There's a desperate character loose.
- And his name is Clay Hardin.
This is monotonous.
Why doesn't one of you Texans bring out a new lie?
One that will astound people.
Honestly now, wouldn't you like to be protected?
Just a little, on one side, huh?
Is it a Western custom to push yourself in on other people?
Yes, ma'am.
That's how the West was settled.
We're not Indians.
Go on, get out of here, scat.
You know,
I saw a poster of you down Mexico way...
...and it didn't half do you justice.
Thank you.
Maybe I do need you to protect me from this Clay Hardin person.
Well, on second thought,
I don't know if I can.
- But I can protect you, ma'am.
- Oh, don't mind me.
I've stood almost everything in the show business, I guess I could stand that.
Then you must be one of those rich cattlemen.
- Are you married?
- Me? Uh-uh.
No. And I haven't got any cattle left.
You see? You was very rude.
He wouldn't marry you anyway.
I wasn't asking for myself.
Well, don't ask him for me either.
You see, out here, we've got a class of men who sort of work in the dark.
Those night raiders got away with just about every cow I own.
I suppose it never occurred to you to put your cows inside at night.
No... Inside?
What on earth is this? Cast iron?
No. Bear jerky.
- Oh.
- That's good.
Do you know what's happening at Delmonico's this minute?
Monico's? Who's he?
He is a famous New York restaurant.
Some actress, not a bit more talented than I am...
...is sitting at a lovely table having lobster and crêpe suzettes...
...and champagne.
Sounds like she's a cinch for the hiccups.
And then every head will turn and watch her as she goes sweeping out.
Oh, she's got the job sweeping out, huh?
- Of course not. She's an actress.
- Oh.
Or, uh, do you know what an actress is?
Oh, sure.
Sure, she's a girl Roy Stuart hires to sing and cut up in his saloon, huh?
Saloon?
Is the Bella Union a saloon?
Well, you wouldn't exactly call it a saloon.
It's more of a drinking joint.
But I have a contract with Roy Stuart.
Why, he's the partner of a man
I worked for in New Orleans, Mr. Legare.
I could never understand why he lets the pigs in there.
They keep running in and out, getting into fights with the dogs. Tsk, tsk.
I won't play there.
I won't even go in the town.
Bozie, you make me so mad, I could cry.
Oh, don't you worry.
Bella Union isn't really that bad.
Mm, ha?
Don't you worry about a thing.
As soon as we start changing horses at Cotulla, I'm gonna take you dancing.
You have a much better chance of dancing with the horses.
Ha, ha. You don't mean that.
Put your little foot
Put your little foot
Put your little foot right out
Put your little foot
Put your little foot
Put your little foot right out
Put your arm around
Put your arm around
Put your arm around my waist
Keep your arm around
Keep your arm around
Keep your arm around my waist
Take a step to the side
Take a step to the rear
Take a step to the side
But forever stay near
Do a little whirl
Do a little whirl
Do a little whirl about
Do a little twirl
Do a little twirl
Do a little twirl about
Walk a little bit
Walk a little bit
Put your little foot right out
Sing a little bit
Sing a little bit
Put your little foot right out
Why, you do this like you were born to it.
Took me years to pick up.
This must be the only thing that took you that long.
Well, we don't see pretty girls like you down here very often.
Ha, ha.
I guess that's why we have to pay for it, huh?
The regular stagecoach stops here overnight.
They don't have to sit up all night bouncing their brains out.
It is not my brains is tired.
Well, use them, then, and get us on the regular stagecoach.
Look, Tuesday, it is last night we played already...
...so we got to be there yesterday yet, because the day before we ain't no place.
- You know?
- What?
Look, next day it is last night we don't start...
...and Tuesday evening is the morning we ain't coming.
- Now you understand?
- Of course not.
I'm sorry, I'm not a teacher. Sheesh.
Hi, Charlie.
Pony Smith was on the stage with me.
Lafe McWilliams tailed us.
I saw them.
They're in the street right this minute.
Public street.
We gotta do something to get you out of this.
- They'll never give you a fair break.
- Did I ask for one?
All right, Clay. It's your carcass.
He called you Clay.
Uh-huh.
- You never told me your name w...
- Well, you never asked me.
- Are you really Clay Hardin?
- Uh-huh.
Well, are they going to arrest you?
I hope not.
Break up our whole evening, wouldn't it?
I'd like this better if Charlie Bell was out of it.
Yeah, I guess you'd like
Clay Hardin out of it too.
I can handle my job.
- Then let's not waste any time.
- Don't worry about me.
Well, Pony, I'll see you in San Antonio.
All right, Lafe.
Thank you.
We get from out now. Maybe?
Well, I think we ought to tie on the nosebag before we get from out now, maybe, huh?
You'll tie on a nosebag, won't you, Jeanne?
Uh, waiter. Two more nosebags, please.
Waiter, I will take one too.
Big size.
This next dance is mine.
I'm sorry, but I'm tired now.
Give us some music, boys.
Don't make me ask loud, lady.
Wait a minute.
I am her management.
She got to have advance billing, or else: Poof.
No wiggles.
Shut up, Bozie.
Surely you heard what the lady said, didn't you, Lafe?
I don't believe I'd horn into this, Hardin.
I've known people to get hurt bad sometimes...
...just by leaving too much slack in their rope.
Uh...
Don't you find it a little crowded in here?
Maybe you'd sooner talk this over in the street.
After you.
Sure.
I think I smell a polecat.
Thanks, Charlie.
What's the matter, Lafe?
Something go wrong?
Did you see that potato draw on me?
He tried to gun me from the side.
Yeah, I saw him, Charlie.
- Charlie.
- Yeah?
Tell you what you do.
Go over to the telegraph office.
Send an overnight wire to Roy Stuart.
Say: "Deal went through as planned. "
You've got a buzzing in your head?
Sign it "Lafe McWilliams. "
Such a business:
Boom, boom, boom.
Just like burying people was no trouble.
Hmm. Heh.
I, uh...
I never thought of it just that way before.
I'm a failure. I don't know how to take care of her in such a madhouse.
If I ever get her back to New York,
I'm gonna have her locked up...
...and spend the rest of my life in some nice, quiet insane asylum.
But you must have known this would happen if you showed yourself here.
Kind of noisy for a minute, wasn't it?
I believe you've been delaying here just to fight those men.
Me? Oh, no.
No, I just like music.
You see Mr. Roy Stuart?
Up in his office.
Five hundred dollars to this Jeanne Starr woman for one week.
Who is she?
Another one of your flea-bitten canaries?
Roy, why don't you leave the artistic end of our business to me?
Because your figures don't tell anything.
The way you run this place, nobody knows where the money goes.
What is this,
New Orleans style or Chinese?
I can't tell you, Roy, how it hurts me to hear you say that.
What a tone of voice to use to your partner. Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Did you ever stop to think what would happen to you, Legare...
...if I caught you shorting me?
You might keep the accounts yourself, you know.
That is, if you can add.
For Mr. Roy Stuart.
Think over what I said.
Muchas gracias, Mr. Stuart.
Look at that. This was sent last night.
Took it 20 hours to come from Cotulla.
They must have brought it on foot, walking backwards.
Why can't they?
Lafe McWilliams must have gone crazy.
I told him 50 times never to wire me.
But I can use it.
Some kind of an accident seems to have happened to Clay Hardin.
May I see it?
I don't think you'd be interested.
Your odds are way off kilter.
The Laredo stage has been in for an hour.
And was Clay Hardin on it?
- Nobody was on it except Charlie Bell.
- That's right.
Funny thing, I've taken more bets since the coach came in than I did before.
Ah.
- Still fussing about the odds, boys?
Well, I guess maybe they are a bit tough, at that.
Fifteen-to-one.
That I'd have to take, if I was betting on my own funeral.
- Give them all they want.
- Right.
Get it out, boys. Come on.
Here's a hundred.
- Yes, Mr. Legare?
- I'm very sorry to bother you, Mr. Pratt.
Mr. Stuart just now received a telegram and tore it up by mistake.
I wonder if you possibly have a copy.
- Yes, I think so.
- Ah.
We don't usually do this, you know, but, uh, seeing that you're his partner.
Yes, of course.
Thank you very much.
He'll appreciate this.
Thank you.
It is the lady! She has come.
The lady from Monterey!
See there? We got us a female visitor.
It's Jeanne Starr. In her own coach.
I wish it was Clay Hardin.
Not me. Come on.
Do you mean to tell me this little mud Indian village is San Antonio?
Oh, it is nice. You will like it.
As far as I'm concerned, it's just another place full of wild savages.
Try to look gorgeous.
Remember, hold in your stomach.
Oh, Henrietta.
Hurry up. Get over there.
Here. Stand straight.
Pay attention.
What's the matter with you? Stay here.
Now, listen, boys, if you can't make it good, make it noisy.
Do you understand that?
Good.
Mademoiselle Jeanne.
It is a pleasure to see you again.
Oh, Monsieur Legare, what a lovely reception.
But then, you always arrange these things so beautifully.
My dear, for such beauty as yours, receptions arrange themselves.
Oh, yes.
Miss Starr, this is my partner, Roy Stuart.
Mr. Stuart,
I've heard so much about you.
You're really a very famous man.
Miss Starr, that's the greatest thing that ever happened to San Antonio.
I was just telling Legare how lucky we are...
I said, I was telling Legare...
It's Clay Hardin! He's back.
There's Clay Hardin.
Why, it's Hardin.
It's Clay Hardin.
Clay! Clay Hardin!
Get back there. Get back.
- Better stay back, out of the line of fire.
- This can be anything.
- Here it comes.
- Don't make any play unless Roy does.
You'd better go inside.
How are you, Roy?
Why, you look a little surprised to see me.
So? Why should I be?
I thought maybe you might have heard something.
There was some talk of you coming back.
And vice versa too, I'll bet.
Did you bet on it, Roy?
It don't mean a thing to me.
I've handled you before, remember?
That's why I've come back.
They don't want any more shooting in San Antone.
Colonel Johnson and the cavalry will grab you inside of 15 minutes.
Unless you get smart and save them the trouble.
Roy, that's just what I'm gonna do.
You're gonna do what?
Save them the trouble.
They eased past the killing point.
For this one minute, they have.
Colonel Johnson left town about an hour ago on Army business.
And he won't be back until tomorrow.
But he told me to tell you, if you showed up in San Antonio, he'd run...
Wait a minute, captain.
I haven't come on any personal business.
I came because I've got the evidence...
...on what and who started the whole Beyar County cattle war.
Here it is.
I brought it straight to the colonel.
And give it to him yourself tomorrow.
I don't want it on my hands overnight.
- Who was it?
- Roy Stuart.
I can show what brands were raided, where cattle went, and what Stuart got.
That's no good until it's shown in court.
I know that. All I want is three days.
Give me two days, and I'll prove every charge I ever made against Stuart.
I can't promise you anything, Hardin.
I only work here.
The colonel told me, the first man who starts shooting...
...during their nesting season, we're gonna grab him and jump all over him.
And abuse him in every way we can think of.
Uh...
Who is "we"?
Well, that's what the colonel says.
I'll be back in the morning.
Come on, Charlie.
We'II, uh, be glad to see you, Hardin.
It looks like we got the Army against us too.
He wasn't much help.
I'll tell you what you do.
Get a hold of Tip Brice, Ricardo Torreon, and Cleve Andrews too, if you can find him.
- Bring them up to the hotel.
- Pronto.
Should've bribed him, Charlie.
- Reach for the sky, you!
- Oh, cut it out, Clay, will you?
Clay, I'm glad to see you.
- How are you?
- I'm glad to see you.
Say, Texas ought to make this a holiday.
Horsefeathers.
Come on, light and squat, you Indians.
I got something to say to you.
I want you to listen and listen fast.
What's on your mind?
I sent for you because you were always too dumb to know when you were licked.
All right. Now I want you to back my play just once more.
We're in awful poor shape for any more fighting, Clay.
Cleve, you stand up to Roy Stuart just one more day...
...and I guarantee you by tomorrow night we'll have the state of Texas on our side.
- One day can be a long, long time.
- Show them the tally book, Clay.
Is that what you were after in Mexico?
What did you think he was doing?
Picking flowers?
Just a minute, 500 head of Bar nine.
That's my brand.
I didn't sell those cattle.
It's signed by Roy Stuart.
How did you hook onto this, Clay?
Well, one night we saw a whole herd of cattle stampeding through the Rio.
We tied into them and stampeded them back.
- Get any of the rustlers?
- Uh-huh. One only, one of Roy Stuart's men.
We found his body in the brush by the river.
He had this tally book inside his shirt.
You caught them running my cattle into Mexico?
What do you mean, your cattle?
Everyone had cattle in that herd.
You see how he's worked?
He'd drive those stolen cattle down into Mexico.
Then he'd sell them back into Texas across a thousand miles of border.
Now, get Stuart and Beyar County will come back.
It's no use unless you all get on the witness stand...
...and swear that you never sold these cattle.
I might as well tell you that witness stand's the hottest seat in Texas.
So all the boys should come in.
Notes, notes, music.
If you're gonna rehearse that orchestra, don't you think you'd?
No!
What on earth is that?
- Something usual.
- You never looked like that before.
I want to surprise you.
Oh, Bozie, this is no time for jokes.
This is legal evidence which we never had before.
It amounts to yes or no for southwest Texas.
As long as we've got these bills of sale on our cattle signed by Stuart, we've got him.
- It's about time, Clay.
- All right, now here's our...
Here's our first move.
Wait, wait, wait a minute.
You must not go:
"Doodle, doodle, deedle. "
You must go:
"Deedle, deedle, doodle. "
Always the opposite.
I have never seen in my...
Look, look. Upside down, he's got it.
You think the audience is sitting on its head? Turn it.
Now, here it is.
Stop it, stop it, stop it!
Am I supposed to sing to that?
It is a nice arrangement.
I think of it myself.
It will tear down the dump. You will see.
Oh! I don't suppose it makes any difference whether anybody hears me or not.
Probably some professional horseback rider will come in...
...and everybody will turn their backs on me.
Hey, how about a little quiet in here?
Are you always every place?
- Just keep it quiet, will you, please?
- Oh!
- Better run for it, young man.
Never touched me.
You're getting closer, but I can't wait.
I'll see you tonight in the saloon.
If you had common sense, you'd stay out of that bear's nest tonight.
What are you talking about?
The more lights, the more people, the more peace, you know that.
- I don't know anything of the kind.
- Ahh.
Can you imagine a man wanting to miss that Jeanne Starr? Oh.
Sometimes I worry about you. Come on.
Oh, shut up.
- Waiter.
- Yes, sir.
- Take these in to Ms. Starr, will you?
- Right away.
- Here.
- Thank you.
Not for me. I'll be at the bar.
We can keep an eye on everybody that way.
Hello, Ed. Where did you get the parrot?
It's a southern parrot.
It came from Mississippi.
- Ha, ha. Parrots don't come from the South.
- Oh, they don't, eh?
How y'all? Awk!
Fine, thanks.
- You sent for me, Mr. Stuart?
- Oh, not sent, Miss Starr.
I just said whenever it was convenient.
Oh.
- Well, I haven't much time to change.
- Oh, there's no hurry.
They'll hold the curtain for me.
- Shall we have a little drink for luck?
- No, thank you.
I hope you're going to enjoy San Antone.
I'm sure we're going to enjoy you.
After the show, if you'd like...
...I thought we might have a little dinner up here.
It's more private, nobody will disturb us.
No, no, Roy.
Not now, just a friendly call.
I'll tell you when the shooting starts.
What do you want here?
Oh, Miss Jeanne,
Mr. Legare said he'd like to see you.
- He's right next door.
- Thank you.
You'll excuse me, Mr. Stuart?
- I asked you a question.
- I know.
You were asking another when I came in.
Is that your girl?
Could be.
We haven't made up our minds yet.
Come in.
You sent for me, Mr. Legare?
Did I?
Oh, yes, of course.
Please, won't you sit down?
- I should be getting backstage.
- Oh, don't worry, they'll wait for you.
And for me.
You know, my dear...
...I have been looking forward so much to this visit of yours.
Really, like a young boy.
What a pity it was in New Orleans that we didn't see more of each other.
Mm, but now...
Pardon me, I just came in to tell you
Bozie's looking for you, Miss Jeanne.
He's going crazy downstairs.
Thank you, Mr. Hardin.
I really must run now.
Roy, you want us to do something about Clay Hardin?
Not till I tell you.
It's really a pity, Roy...
...that you don't take fuller advantage of my brains.
As I think of it now, I'm afraid you have made another wretched mistake.
Don't talk so much.
I'm thinking now of a very interesting tally book...
...that I accidentally looked into once.
One accident can lead to another, Legare.
As I recall, the book contained some very curious bills of sale...
...transferring cattle.
I write bills of sale everyday.
Yes. But this time you were selling cattle that didn't belong to you, Roy.
I suppose you learned that by accident too.
Did it never occur to you that some of the people who work for you...
...may also be friends of mine?
I've always suspected it.
That's how I know that this tally book...
...this convicting evidence against you...
...has fallen into the hands of someone else.
Don't you know what's going to happen if you don't get it back?
You'd like to get a hold of it yourself, wouldn't you? Ha-ha-ha.
I wonder who has that book of yours now.
I suppose it might be someone sitting at one of those tables.
It might even be someone standing at that bar.
I suppose one man's guess is as good as another's, isn't it?
Now, don't step on your dress and trip and spoil your number.
I think I'll send Clay Hardin a note and thank him for his flowers.
Now, hold still. You look like a rag doll.
Jeanne, if you follow my advice, you let that fellow alone.
He was born for trouble.
Gentlemen, tonight is a night you will never forget.
I hasten to present Jeanne Starr.
I'm so happy, oh, so happy
And why shouldn't I be?
There's a reason
And the reason is as simple as ABC
Some Sunday morning
Is going to be
Some Sunday morning
For someone and me
Bells will be chiming an old melody
Specially for someone
And me
There'll be an organ playing,
Friends and relations will stare
Say, can't you hear them saying
"Gee, what a peach of a pair"
Some Sunday morning
We'll walk down the aisle
He'll be so nervous
And I'll try to smile
Things sure look rosy
For someone and me
Some Sunday morning you'll see
Have you ever gazed at the silvery moon
Hanging low in a Texas sky?
And looked out across the plains
While the breeze hummed a tune
To the tumbleweed tumbling by?
Have you ever walked
By the old Rio Grande?
Have you ever seen sage all in bloom?
Have you felt the delight
Of just roaming around
Way out there
Where there's plenty of room?
Or did you ever ride down
An old cattle trail
While the stars like a million eyes
Seem to look down and say
"When you're down Texas way,
You're really in paradise"
Some Sunday morning
We'll walk down the aisle
He'll be so nervous
And I'll try to smile
Things sure look rosy
For someone and me
We're waiting patiently
To see how heavenly
Some Sunday morning
Can be
Some Sunday morning
There's going to be
Some Sunday morning
For someone and me
Bells will be chiming an old melody
Specially for someone and me
I got a note from the gal to Clay Hardin.
What will I do with it?
Friends and relations will stare
Say, can't you hear them saying
"Gee, what a peach of a pair"
- Give it to him.
- Lf that's the way you want it, boss.
Some Sunday morning
We'll walk down the aisle
He'll be so nervous and I'll try to smile
- Get that drunken cat off the bar.
- Yeah, he is a little drunk, isn't he?
For someone and me
From Miss Starr.
Some Sunday morning
You'll see
Some Sunday morning
Wait a minute, Clay. Don't go back there.
You can't trust anybody in San Antonio tonight.
- This girl's a complete stranger.
- Yeah?
Who brought her here?
Who's she working for?
- Stuart and Legare.
- You didn't always scare this easy.
Oh, all right, go on.
At least let me carry the tally book while you're dilly-dallying.
- You got no right to risk everything.
- Ha, ha.
- Sure, if it will make you any happier, here.
- Careful.
There'll be an organ playing
You're like a ticklish girl at a strawberry festival. Here.
Say, can't you hear them saying
"Gee, what a peach of a pair"
Fair and lovely
Some Sunday morning
We'll walk down the aisle
He'll be so nervous
And I'll try to smile
Henrietta, will you please open the door to the gallery?
It is open.
We're waiting patiently
To see how heavenly...
Well, don't stand there like a ninny.
Come in and shut the door.
This is nice. I'm so glad you came up.
Now, don't talk all night.
You need your rest, you know.
It was sweet of you to send me those flowers you picked yourself.
- Well, I can see you needed them.
- Ha, ha.
And, uh, I'm sorry
I threw those things at you this afternoon.
Oh, that's all right.
Usually, you have to stand in line to throw things at me.
Oh.
It's stifling in here, Clay.
- Let's go out on the gallery.
- Sure.
What's out on that gallery, the pay window?
I feel sorry for the rest of the country.
Struggling along in plain and fancy ignorance.
Poor Louisiana, poor old Arkansas.
What's the matter?
Is Texas going to take them in?
Just think of all the other towns there are.
And only San Antonio rates a performance by Miss Jeanne Starr.
Oh, now, wait a minute.
Where does a cowboy learn to talk like that?
And then to the south of our little house...
...nothing but mile upon mile of button-hole bushes.
They're lovely.
I guess I'm supposed to sew on all the buttons.
Why, of course. Oh, I can see it all.
Birds singing in the trees, flowers coming up.
Oh, yes, and here's the main event:
The whole thing's completely surrounded by millions of assorted cattle.
Oh, that really settles it.
Your old cows scare me to pieces with those long antlers or whatever they are.
Antlers?
So you can't get away from it, Jeannie.
Everything either begins in Texas or ends up there.
That's just it.
Who wants to end up?
Well, if that was a Texas kiss, I...
Maybe I shouldn't have broken up those two meetings you had.
Get inside.
Tell me, Bozic.
What do you see?
L... I don't think I see nobody.
Just remember that.
And remember this:
Nothing was ever more important in your life.
The whole play went wrong.
There'll be guns talking all over the place in another 24 hours.
Joey, you ride to Hondo.
Ride to Sabinal if you have to, and get Harkness' bunch.
Rebel, you swing out to Pilgrim.
Bring in the High-Five and the Jingle-Bob outfits.
You others fetch in your own.
I want the wild bunch in San Antonio by tomorrow night.
The cavalry's still here, Roy.
Pretty tough mixing with that outfit.
If you'd sooner hang...
...I'll see you get the prettiest flowers ever thrown on a corpse.
Come on, boys.
Break out of it.
On your feet. He's coming right in.
- Yeah?
- Get your boys and ride into San Antone.
Roy Stuart wants a hundred gunfighters by sundown tomorrow.
- What for?
- Never mind what for, just get in there.
Well, Stuart's got a lot of brass, that's all I got to say.
Okay, I'll tell him that.
No, wait a minute.
Tell him we'll come in.
I'm sorry to have to continue pressing these questions, Miss Starr...
...but I think you understand the importance of your testimony in this inquiry.
- I'll do anything I can to help.
- Yes, I'm sure you will.
How close were you to Clay Hardin when he was fired on?
Quite...
Quite close.
- This was outside your dressing room.
- We were standing on the gallery.
Someone shot at Mr. Hardin out of the dark.
It broke the window behind us...
...but no one told me to have him stand there.
No one made any suggestion about it.
I swear they didn't, no one.
Tut, tut, tut. Nobody said they did.
That was your own bring-up entirely.
- Don't you believe me?
Yes, yes.
Did you see anyone on the patio?
No, sir.
I don't know anything else.
That's all, Miss Starr.
Thank you very much.
Uh, who is this Sacha Bozic or Beezic or something?
Bozic, Bozic, Bozic.
B- O-Z, zic, Bozic.
- That's me, Your Highness.
- Don't call me that.
Yes, please.
Now, you don't have to give any answers incriminating yourself...
...but where were you when this hurrah broke loose?
I...
I... Please, I was breathing air.
- What?
- Thank you, thank you, thank you.
I mean, I come outside the dump from inside...
...because there is no air inside the dump.
And I think maybe there is air outside, so I am outside now.
Oh, never mind the climate.
What did you see outside the dump?
Ha, ha. I mean, the Bella Union?
I see nothings. It is so dark.
You can't see nothings.
Great catfish, man.
You just admitted you were there.
- Yes, Excellency.
- Don't call me that either.
- Yes, please.
- Go on.
All of a... All of a...
All of a click, the gun start to go shoot.
I run one way... No, I run two ways.
I try to go someplace else...
...then I come to this man who lies down.
I make a look.
- He's dead.
- Who else did you see?
A- After that...
It is after that a lot of people comes out...
...and helps me look at the deceased.
He's still dead.
- Is that all the light you have to shed?
- Yes, please, that is all I shed.
Well, we found out a sum total of nothing.
Thank you, Your Highness.
We haven't heard anything to prove that Mr. Stuart was in his office...
...as he says he was, the time the killing took place.
I think I can dig up a few witnesses to that.
If someone has shown a reason why I should.
No one has.
It would be much more to the point, Hardin...
...to produce one witness who knows he was not where he says.
There's gotta be some connection.
Otherwise, he's innocent.
You ought to know that.
I know all that, colonel.
I'm sorry we can't get better results here.
Especially since I have to call your attention to our bulletin of this morning.
The military aid we've been giving here is withdrawn.
Stopped, pulled out from under, as of at once.
I don't like to leave in the face of a blowup...
But I've been ordered to go put the quietus on an Indian whittle whang.
My cavalry will leave tonight.
You people are on your own, and heaven help you.
In that case, colonel, there's something I'd like to ask.
If you're pulling out, you gotta leave a peace officer here.
The post of town marshal is vacant.
I think I'm the man to fill it.
- Why?
- I'll tell you why if you want.
I was raised by Charlie Bell, ever since
I was about 2-and-a-half feet high.
When I was a kid,
Indians were playing up bad.
He'd have to take me out and hide me in the brush.
I wouldn't be alive except for Charlie, and he wouldn't be dead except for me.
You give me the authority, and I'll get you the man that killed him.
All right, I'll appoint you for 24 hours only.
By that time, a new marshal...
...can be designated in the regular way.
So that's how long you've got to get...
...the killer in a legal manner.
- I'll try to see that it's long enough.
What's happened to that Starr woman?
How can you speak of her marvelous attraction as "that woman"?
Where's her manager?
Hasn't been around since the inquiry.
Well, it's about time you were asking me that.
He's probably shut in his room, but I advise you to go and see.
You advise me?
Didn't you gather that Bozic was wandering around outside our dump, as he calls it...
...at the time you were shooting up these people?
- I shot nobody.
- Yes, yes, of course not.
Stick to it, by all means.
I got no more notion of who shot this infernal Charlie Bell than you have.
But you were having a little gun spree in the patio, weren't you?
That's a great plenty to hang you, you know?
Yet you just casually let an eyewitness go kicking around...
...without the least precaution.
- Who's taking care of him?
- Nobody, Roy.
Nobody at all.
Then you don't know whether he's still in that room or not.
No, I don't.
For all we know, he is wandering all over the place...
...talking freely to all kinds of people.
Don't you ever take care of anything yourself anymore?
Jeanne. Jeanne.
- Feeling better, Bozic?
- I feel... I feel terrible.
- Terrible.
Oh, I'm sorry.
He always feels terrible.
- But never like this.
If he feels like he's dying, there's beginning to be justice around here.
You are a heartless old wrinkle.
Always the opposite.
- Come on, Jeanne.
- No, Jeanne, I must speak to you.
- We haven't time to hear...
- No, no, no, only Jeannie, please.
Go ahead, I'll be with you in a moment.
If he tells you he's run us out of money again, don't be surprised.
What's the matter, Bozie?
Jeanne, a terrible thing make itself to happen next.
- Wait a minute.
- It is true, I don't know how to tell myself.
Jeanne, it is a murder wants to happen and I'm it.
Oh, for goodness' sake, Bozie.
Now, tell me. What is it?
It is so necessary nobody can help.
I don't hope.
You see, I... I know... I...
I know who was the murderer who kills Charlie Bell.
- Who was it?
- I can't tell you, I don't dare tell you.
- You should have told them at the inquiry.
- Yes, I know, but then I could not think.
And now it is too late.
He has people helping him.
They are all around us.
They are in the patio, in the stairs.
- Well, what do you want to do?
- We must try to get away, get away.
Maybe they will let us go when they see we are just quietly going from out.
Oh, Bozie. I can't go.
I...
- You would just wait for them to kill me?
- No.
But, well, you can get out of here a whole lot better without me.
Now, grab what you need and get away from here this very minute.
No, no, I could not leave you alone.
If you don't, I'll march straight to Clay Hardin with the whole thing.
No, you mustn't, you mustn't.
It's the worst you could do.
Then you would be in danger too.
Well, then, get out of here.
Don't argue with me.
Please hurry up.
All right, Jeanne, if you want me to.
- Jeanne...
- Bozie, go on.
Aah!
I can't do it. I can't leave.
You can't do what?
I can't...
Mr. Stuart.
I understand that you're known to roam around some at night.
L... I didn't mean to. I was only breathing air.
You were behind the Bella Union when Bell died, weren't you?
You don't need to say it.
Don't, please. Don't.
I wouldn't tell on Mr. Legare.
I wou...
You wouldn't tell on who?
L... I didn't mean to see him.
I didn't know Mr. Legare was there.
I...
I was just running away.
You saw Legare shoot Bell?
No, no.
I swear I don't tell somebody.
Shut up.
Yes, please.
I never thought he had that kind of gravel in his craw.
And you'll be out of town in 15 minutes?
Fifteen minutes. Yes.
Make it 10 minutes.
Ten minutes.
Ten minutes. Ten...
Five minutes.
Five minutes.
Where's Legare?
He's eating, down in the middle of the plaza.
Keep a close lookout on Clay Hardin.
I like to know where he is.
Right.
Jackson.
Worried, Legare?
Well, I was just thinking of borrowing some of your artillery.
As we say in New Orleans:
What does that mean in Texas?
The same thing, Roy.
"There is no one who isn't dangerous for someone. "
The Bozic matter is taken care of, naturally.
He's out of reach.
Including your reach, Legare.
I have no objection to your killing Charlie Bell.
Probably saved me the trouble.
Without actually admitting anything...
...let me say I am happy that you take that view.
But, uh, wouldn't it be strange...
...if I were to find that the tally book is in your hands now?
Ha, ha. Considering that it might easily hang you, I might say yes.
Wouldn't that be odd?
I have thought for some time, Roy, that you need me as a partner...
...in your cattle business.
As well as in the Bella Union.
So you do have the tally book?
I can be a great help to you, Roy.
At the present moment, you are perhaps the most feared man in South Texas.
You're certainly the richest.
You will still be one of the richest if we divide it all.
Can you think of one good reason why I don't kill you?
I can.
You don't know where your tally book is.
Or where it will turn up if I die.
You not only will not kill me, Roy...
...you will defend my life as if it were your own.
It almost works, Legare.
Oh, I think it will.
Every time you look at me, Roy, you must say to yourself:
"There sits my very life and about $ 10 million. "
You think you're smart, don't you?
You are smart.
But not smart enough.
Sure, now it's too early, and later, it will be too late.
Mr. Hardin, Mr. Clay, that lady,
Jeanne Starr, she wanna see you.
Gracias, hombre. Take it.
- I tell her something?
- No, nothing.
Something's happened and we don't know about it.
Unless we can find out before the cavalry leaves...
...it's no use finding out at all.
We can't fight until the cavalry leaves and after that, we can't win.
Roy Stuart's mavericks are piling into town, hand over fist.
That wild bunch could have gone into town last night.
I wonder why they didn't.
Because you did not tell them to,
I suppose.
I wonder why Stuart didn't need them until after Charlie Bell was dead.
If he hadn't killed Charlie Bell,
Texas would have blowed up in his face.
Ah. He's still afraid of that.
You know something, Tip?
I don't think Stuart killed Charlie.
He's dead, ain't he?
Someone else killed him and took that tally book.
- I don't think Stuart knows where it is.
- But then, neither do we.
Someone does.
I've got an idea who it is.
- Go find me Sacha Bozic.
- Sack of what?
Bozic, you know, Jeanne Starr's manager.
A little round fellow like a beer barrel.
- Go ahead, quick.
- All right.
Excuse me, Miss Jeanne.
I'm looking for your Mister...
You know, the little fellow that handles your freight for you.
Oh, Bozic? I think he...
Uh, I don't know where he is.
Miss Jeanne, uh, Clay Hardin is right out there in the plaza.
Jeanne.
Have you talked to Bozic?
Yes, I see that you have.
How does it seem to be in love with San Antonio's leading crack-shot?
Yes, Clay Hardin.
When there are 200 men in the room, you see only him.
I have noticed it.
Do you realize that you yourself are likely to put Clay Hardin in the greatest danger?
I understand Clay Hardin is very good at taking care of himself.
Hmm. Look about you.
How many guns are in this plaza and behind those shutters?
If a man receives 30 bullets in his body in the 10th part of a second...
...what is his next step in taking care of himself?
What kind of people are you here?
Peace-loving people.
But so many would love to see Clay make a wrong move.
It would be too bad if you told him something...
...that would occasion a sudden accident.
I don't need to talk to him at all.
I won't even speak to him.
You will talk to him if it's unavoidable.
But do not seek him out, because if you do,
I'll know I've made a mistake.
I'll be forced to correct it.
Are you sure you ought to be out here by yourself?
The last time we spoke, I think you were accusing me of trying to kill you.
Or of helping someone who wanted to kill you.
What was it you wanted to tell me?
Nothing.
This town is full of men who look as if they'd step on baby chickens.
Is that all you wanted to say?
Or are you sure Legare didn't just give you some new instructions?
Clay, will you take me away from San Antonio?
Right now, this very minute?
You know what that building is over there?
What, that old broken church?
- You ever hear of the Alamo?
- Of course, everyone has, but...
- That's it.
- Clay, will you listen to me, please?
- No, you listen to me.
Texas was born inside those walls.
Those old-time Texans died for something pretty important.
I wouldn't want them to know I pulled out just because it got rough.
- It's hopeless to talk to you, isn't it?
- No.
All you have to do is to be honest just for a minute.
What is it you haven't told me?
Nothing. I swear there's nothing.
If I tell you I believe you, will you stand on that?
- Yes.
Oh, Clay.
Oh, excuse me, miss.
Bozic isn't around here.
He isn't even in town.
Some say he pulled out for Austin by special coach.
Send Bud and Windy after him on the best horses you've got.
Get him back here fast.
- We didn't know he was so important as...
- You know it now, andale.
How did you know that Bozic...?
Who told you?
You did.
You haven't played enough poker.
I guess that ends it, Clay.
There go our troops.
Well, they had to go sometime.
If only Bud and Windy had got back.
They didn't, though.
We couldn't fight them till we had a legal reason.
Now we can't fight at all.
Well, I'll be seeing you, boys.
- Wait, Clay, we'd better go with you.
- Not this time.
What are you gonna do, Clay?
There's always one more drink left in the jug.
I wonder what he meant by that.
Aren't you ever going to forgive me for something I didn't even do?
Uh, did you ever hear of an animal called a Judas goat?
- No, but never mind that now, Clay.
- But I do mind now.
When sheep are driven to be slaughtered, they balk and won't go in.
So a goat is put in to lead them.
- I don't care anything about that.
- I do.
Sheep trust the goat.
They go where she leads.
The goat walks through untouched, but the sheep following are killed.
Is that what you believe of me?
Clay.
Funny part of it is,
Charlie Bell warned me.
If I had listened, he'd be alive tonight.
Wouldn't he?
I wish I'd run away when Bozic did.
Excuse me, Mr. Hardin.
It's time for you to take the stage, my dear.
All right, I'll go.
I hope you have no objection, Mr. Hardin.
Should I have?
Why, of course not.
I know you won't believe me.
But I'm worried about Bozic.
He still isn't here, hasn't even been heard from.
Well, I have to go on anyway.
You know something about this you're not telling me.
You think because I scold Bozie,
I don't care what happens to him.
Well, I scold you too, and I've stuck to you through whistle stops and high water.
I think that's my cue.
You're not ready to go on.
Oh, let me get it over with, Henrietta.
- There's no time.
- There is time.
The orchestra will ad-lib.
I wish you'd look at yourself.
Sit down, Roy.
I don't think you came here just to sit around and scratch fleas.
That's right.
I came to make an arrest.
Clay, as it so happens,
I didn't kill Charlie Bell.
I know that, Roy.
Then what do you want?
I want the man who did.
Secondly, I want an end to raiding in Beyar County.
I know only one way to get that.
But there's another way to get the man who killed Charlie.
Let's watch the show, huh?
That day I crossed the border
He tossed a glance and I lost my heart
Somewhere in Monterey
In broken Spanish
I spoke in Spanish
Love is a Spanish art
So we had lots to say
And then sighing, "hasta mañana"
He ran away
Back to his hacienda
His wife and 10 little chicodees
Somewhere in Monterey
Enjoying the act?
Once, for about five minutes...
...that one girl could have straightened this whole thing out.
Maybe.
But she can't get you out of it now.
Hmm? What's that?
I'll make a deal with you.
Drop all charges against me, give me full immunity...
...I'll give you the man who killed Charlie Bell.
When I've got him, I've also got you.
You know that, don't you?
I know my tally book of cattle sales was taken from Charlie's body.
But if you had it again, you could blow up half this state.
Right.
That's why you've got no chance of making a deal with me.
Then that's also why you haven't got a chance of getting the killer.
Because I'll have to stop you.
That day she crossed the border
He tossed a glance and she lost her heart
Roy, for a moment,
I almost thought you could do it.
I'll see you later.
She spoke in Spanish
Love is a Spanish art
So they had lots to say
Well, what's out there? Bill collectors?
You may as well tell me so I can deal with them.
We've gotta get out of here.
Go back to the hotel.
Hire a coach and put our stuff into it.
- Where are we going?
- I don't even know.
And 10 little chicodees
Somewhere in Monterey
Good evening.
Nope.
Come here.
It comes to me that I have been wrong.
I haven't said anything.
Nothing's happened.
Something has happened.
You have done what I expressly forbade you to do.
- What harm can it...?
- I believe I warned you not to seek him out.
I'll leave San Antonio if you want me to.
I'll get out of here tonight.
I'm afraid it's a little late for that.
Drop your hand.
I got a friend here to see you.
Come in, Bozic.
L... I run away, but I came back.
You're under arrest, Legare, for the murder of Charlie Bell.
I think you'll find it isn't as easy as that.
Don't move.
In about 10 minutes, my job will be done.
May I point out that your next 10 minutes are infinitely uncertain?
Roy Stuart and I detest each other, as you may know.
Yet he has become extremely valuable to me...
...so that I would defend him at the risk of my life.
I'm sure you would.
Conversely, Roy Stuart has a very special reason for valuing me.
Believe me, there hasn't been one moment since you entered the Bella Union...
...when you could have left the building without my help.
I expect to have your help.
You're gonna walk ahead of me until I get outside.
Not too fast and not too slow.
Shall we start?
Not that way.
We're gonna walk through the Bella Union.
Look out, Clay!
Behind you, Clay.
You never were smart enough to be my partner, Legare.
I...
I have been waiting for you, Roy.
Don't move, Stuart.
Drop that gun.
No, no, no.
The big one must go under, so it won't be on top.
That is why the big one is smaller.
Give a push up so it don't stick in so far out.
Sheesh, shoosh.
Always the opposite.
Bozic.
Yes, darling, what can I do for you?
There must have been some answer.
No, Jeanne. No answer is from.
Well, didn't he even say anything to the boy who took my note to him?
The boy don't know where is Clay Hardin, so I send him to look where he ain't...
...to see if he is back.
I don't see the boy since after.
Now, go inside, please, before you change my mind some more.
Maybe Clay never got your note at all.
We got to get her out of this terrible town.
If you can't say nothing, don't speak.
If she can't get her mind off that rider, there's no sense in taking her 200 miles.
She'd only turn around and come back.
I'd do the same thing myself.
Jeanne, if you feel so bad, we don't go someplace.
We don't leave until after we all get killed yet.
If that is what you want. Ah.
No, Bozie. We're leaving now.
If he can't even walk across the plaza to say goodbye to me...
...I don't want to see him again or think of him or hear his name.
Now we pack.
Quick, quick, quick.
Begin putting the stuff on the...
Huh?
Gee. You...
I was very happy to meet you.
Thank you. See you again.
It was very nice. Thank you.
You've searched the Alamo again since daylight?
There was only one body in the Alamo.
The body of Legare.
Nobody knows what happened in there.
Oh, we'll know more about it when we find Clay.
- Lf we find him.
- Yeah.
Aye.
Move over, honey.
Look, look, look.
There goes an empty horse.
You look like they drug you through in an irrigation project, backwards.
He looks as though they completely killed him.
- Just where do you think you're going?
- Out of Texas, you can bet on that.
- How can you even think of leaving Texas?
- Well, I...
Can't you see the sad look in the eyes of those poor little cattle out there?
Look at them.
- You mean, that Matagorda knot-head?
- Yeah. Huh?
Matagorda?
Now, just a minute.
Since when did Easterners start talking about Matagordas?
Well, I... I guess I just wasn't thinking. L...
I'll say you weren't.
I always thought there was something phony about you.
Now, are you going to tell me the truth?
Just where were you born and raised, huh?
Fort Worth.
A Texan, I thought so.
I could have gotten away with it if I'd really tried.
You let go of her, Clay Hardin.
We're going to New Orleans alone.
No, ma'am, we're not.
There is only one place for us Texans.
Amigo, turn around.
- Always the opposite.
- Ha, ha! That's right.
Whoa, Dan!
- Pinky!
- Yes, sir.
- Come over here.
- Yes, sir.
Take him back to the barn.
I'm going up to the house.
- Clem oughta be getting in from town.
- Yes, sir, Mr. Frank.
- Pinky.
- Yes, sir?
Ain't you never gonna learn?
What's my name?
Why, uh, Woodson.
Mr. Ben Woodson, sir.
Why do you call me Mr. Frank?
Ain't it just as easy to say Mr. Ben?
Well, seein' as I been calling you Mr. Frank ever since you were knee-high to nothin'... ain't no harm in callin' you Mr. Frank when ain't nobody around here, is there?
Except that one day you're gonna forget and bawl out Mr. Frank when folks is around.
Pinky, Frank James isn't hiding in these hills. He's dead.
Dead?
W- Well, you ain't dead.
- You callin' me a liar?
- Oh, no, sir. No, sirree, but—
Ain't no buts about it, Pinky. Frank James is dead and buried and underground.
Yes, sure. Sure he's dead and buried and under the ground and rotted.
- Now remember.
- Yes, I'll remember, Mr. Frank.
Jesse—
They killed him!
- Jesse dead?
- Yeah. Shot through the back when he weren't lookin'.
Ain't no other way they could have got Jesse. They know who done it?
Sure they know. It was them sneakin' cowards, Bob and Charlie Ford.
Bob and Charlie, huh?
Poor Zee and the baby.
Frank, can I go with you?
Go with me?
Well, I know you don't need any help, but—
I reckon I don't, seein' as I ain't aimin' to do anything.
What?
Ain't no more to be said now.
Tell Pinky to rustle up some supper.
Gosh, I was so sure you'd wanna light out after them Fords...
I bought me a gun.
Hand it over.
I used my own money.
Hand it over.
You're getting too big for your britches, son.
You got no call to be totin' a gun.
Well, I figured if there was any trouble—
There ain't gonna be no trouble.
Listen, son.
When your father was killed up at Northfield...
I brought you down here hopin' you'd grow up to be a regular hardworkin' man.
So far I got no complaints.
We've been gettin' along fine, you and me... workin', mindin' our own business.
We bothered nobody.
Nobody's bothered us.
Ain't what them Fords done bothered you none?
The courts will take care of the Fords.
- Supposin' they don't?
- I'm supposin' they will.
Whatever Jesse done, he was murdered, and the law don't hold with murder.
Frank, if nothin' gonna happen to them Fords... ain't some folks gonna think that...
- well, maybe you're—
- Scared?
- Well?
- What do you think?
Oh, I know you ain't scared.
You ain't scared of anything.
But, gosh, I wish you and me, we could—
Vittles is ready.
Sit down, Mr. Frank.
I mean, Mr. Ben.
I mean, Mr. Ben.
Mr. Frank is dead.
I mean, Mr. Ben, Mr. Frank is dead.
So I mean, Mr. Ben, mmm, Mr. Ben,
I mean, Mr. Ben, Mr. Frank is dead.
So, I mean, Mr. Ben. I mean, Mr. Ben.
I mean, Mr. Ben, Mr. Frank is dead.
Sinners, sons of Belial... prepare for the vengeance of the Lord.
The day of reckoning is mighty close.
You'll catch it hip and thigh if you don't get to repentin'. And get to it quick.
Hellfire's awaitin' you.
Are you ready to meet your Maker?
I reckon so.
You willing to stand before the judgment seat with a chaw of tobacco in your mouth?
Lost souls,
that's what you all are.
Black with sin.
Black with iniquity.
The light of the Lord ain't in any of you.
Do you ever think of salvation?
Do you ever think of the Kingdom?
No. All you ever think of is your bellies and your cornpone...
and your chitlins
and your corn liquor.
Brother, how about a swig of that jug?
- Ain't hard liquor, is it?
- No, plain spring water.
Oh.
- Crop all in?
- Yeah.
- You from town?
- Uh-huh.
- Any news?
- Hogs is up two cents.
- Good.
- You remember about them Ford boys?
- The fellas that killed Jesse James?
- Yeah.
- I "heared" at the telegraph office they're gonna be hanged.
- You don't tell me.
Uh-huh. Jury found them guilty of murderin' Jesse.
Don't know why though, bein' as there's a reward out for his killin'.
Revival meetin' at Clinton tomorrow night.
Be there, brother. It's me and the devil and no holds barred.
Giddap!
Law's all right, huh?
"Beatenest" thing I ever did see.
It's like I figured, ain't a jury in western Missouri... would stand for shooting a friend when he ain't lookin', no matter what he done.
That'll be a lesson to you, son.
What about us going over to that revival meeting tomorrow night?
I think it's safe enough
if I sort of stay in the shadows.
I reckon you'd like to see some other folks once in a while.
Oh, I ain't hankerin' to see no other folks.
But let's go fishin' tomorrow, you and me, huh?
Sure, son, sure.
Here it is, Mr. Frank.
Ain't they hangin' 'em?
No, they let them off and give them the reward money.
I knowed that preacher man heared wrong.
It's just like my pappy always said...
"There ain't no law for the poor folks except the end of a gun."
Hush up.
I was certain sure they wasn't gonna do nothin'.
Did they ever do anything for our kind of folks? No.
McCoy and his railroad stole your farm and killed your mother. What happened? Nothin'.
And that time Jesse give hisself up.
Did the law treat him right?
Uh—
Pinky, saddle the horses.
- Yes, sir!
- Just my horse.
- Yes, sir.
- You ain't goin' nowheres.
Oh, please, Frank.
I won't get in the way.
You and Pinky gotta stay here and look after the farm. I won't be gone long.
Oh, Pinky can take care of things.
There ain't much to do right now.
The fence has gotta be finished.
The stock's gotta be taken care of.
- Anyways, you're too young.
- I'm no baby. I'm grown up.
Ain't no use arguin', Clem.
The Fords is my affair personal... and you ain't goin' with me.
Pinky, I'm leavin' Clem in your charge.
- Don't let him get out of your sight.
- No, sir.
- See he studies his figurin' and his readin'.
- Yes, sir, Mr. Frank.
If you want me for anything important,
Major Cobb will know where I am.
- Good-bye, Pinky. Good-bye, son.
- Good-bye, sir.
Look after things while I'm gone too.
- Hello, Joe. Hello, Fred.
- Hello.
Didn't know you boys could read.
Hello, Connie.
How's your pa?
Whiskey. What'll it be, boys?
Bob Ford's buyin'.
- Have a drink, Major.
- I don't drink with rats.
- Watch out, Major.
- No danger. The Fords only shoot at backs.
- You tryin' to make trouble?
- No, but if I had my way—
You had your way.
You and your stinkin' paper... did everything you could to hang us, didn't ya?
Well, we're free now, and we got the reward money.
- There isn't a thing you can do about it.
- Come, come, gentlemen.
Let bygones be bygones.
The James case is a closed issue.
Not by a gosh-dang sight it ain't.
And it won't be closed till Jesse's brother's paid for every dad-blasted drop of it.
Your hands ain't any too clean either, Runyan.
Mine?
What have I done?
As an officer employed by the railroad, naturally l—
Oh, don't pay any attention to the old buzzard. Talk, talk, that's all he can do.
Yeah, that's about all I can do.
But those James boys are mighty peculiar. Mighty peculiar.
Jesse's gone, that's true.
Maybe Frank's gone too.
And then again, maybe he ain't.
The boys always had a mighty peculiar
way of turning up...
just when you least expected them.
Mighty peculiar.
What are your plans?
I'm going out West to see a friend of mine.
When?
Now.
Now read it back to me, Roy.
"If we're ever gonna have law and order in this part of the country...
"we gotta take vipers like those Fords...
"and that slimy railroad detective Runyan... and shoot 'em down like dogs."
Right. Now, paragraph.
"Furthermore, we've got to abolish the pardoning power"—
Better go back and get your supper, Roy.
Yes, sir.
Come in, Frank, come in. Come in!
I knew you'd be along this way soon, but you're a wee bit late.
- Late? Ain't they here?
- No. They's gone out of town a few hours ago.
Yeah, yeah, get away from this window.
Now, now, come on. Sit down and tell me all about yourself and your folks.
Here. Here. Have a drink.
- Well, family's all right. They're in Kansas City.
- Yeah?
About me?
There ain't nothin' to tell.
I've been hiding out down in the Ozarks, farmin'. Heard about Jesse.
Frank, it was the dirtiest, rottenest, sneakiest that ever was.
Oh, Jesse may have had killin' comin' to him. I ain't denyin' that.
But to be shot in the back by a couple of fellas that was like brothers to you... with a weapon you give them yourself.
- I know, but about this pardon—
- All part of the same piece.
McCoy put the Fords up to the killin', then got 'em the pardon and the reward.
- McCoy, huh?
- Yeah.
Got no idea at all where the Fords went to?
None whatever, exceptin' they took the cars west.
What you aimin'to do?
Sure like to meet up with Bob and Charlie.
Old friends of mine, you know.
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I know. I know.
Well, I'll be movin' along.
Well, good huntin', Frank.
- I'll let you know where I am.
- All right.
- Good night, Major.
- Hold on. Hold on, son, hold on.
Wait.
Come on. Come on.
Bye, son.
Roy!
- Yes, sir.
- Get out them obituaries of the Fords...
- and set 'em up in type.
- Yes, sir.
Giddap! Giddap!
Pinky.
What are you doing here?
- That boy Clem done run away.
- Run away? When?
Just after you left.
He hopped on his horse and scat.
I tried to stop him, but he nearly knocked me over.
That boy's harder to hold than a handful of bumblebees.
Y'all find what you're looking for, sir?
No, Pinky, they ain't here. They lit out for the West somewheres.
Mm, must have got a feeling.
You goin' out after them, sir?
Yeah, but not for a while maybe.
I gotta get me some money.
You ain't figurin' on no robbin', is ya?
No, Pinky, them days is far behind me.
Praise the Lord, Mr. Frank.
Praise the Lord.
- Pinky, I'm a-thinkin'.
- About what, Mr. Frank?
It was McCoy money that put Jesse in his grave back there, wasn't it?
Then ain't it fittin' I use
McCoy money to get the Fords?
What'd you say, Mr. Frank?
Yeah, that's right.
- Tomorrow's the 15th, ain't it?
- Yes, sir, it's the 15th.
St. Louis Midland pays off the first and the 15th.
- Money oughta be in the express office tonight.
- Oh, Mr. Frank.
- Pinky, go back to the farm right away and stay there.
- Yes, sir, sir.
If Clem shows up, tell him I'm gonna brush the britches right off of him.
- Yes, sir, Mr. Frank.
- Good-bye, Pinky.
Good-bye, Mr. Frank.
And God bless you, sir.
Good evenin'.
Kinda chilly for spring, ain't it?
Yeah, a nip in the air.
What's on your mind, friend?
Well, I got this to send out.
- Can't you send it in the mornin', can't ya?
- No. Wanna get it on the 4:15.
Oh, all right.
Can you write?
Yes, sir, after a fashion.
All right.
Then fill out this blank.
- Reach, brother.
- I-I'm a-reachin'.
I got a notion when I come in you was kind of sleepy.
- Suppose you lay down and rest a while.
- Huh?
Down!
Flat on your face.
Now lay there still and don't let me hear a peep out of you.
You'll hear nothin' from me, brother.
I wanna be around for breakfast.
Go to sleep.
I'll wake you up before I go.
- Get down.
- Yes, sir.
Clem!
- What are you doin' here?
- I've been followin' ya. I was watchin' outside.
- And when you didn't come out—
- You fool, I almost shot you.
Now get outta here and back to the farm before I skin you alive. Git!
Bolt the door.
Keep your eye on the watchman.
Where'd that shot come from?
Down here, Sid. Come on!
- What's up?
- There's a shot!
- Seemed to come from in there.
- You and you, get a ram, break that door down.
A couple of you men get around to the rear.
Come on, the back way.
Come on, boys, break 'er down!
Get in there!
Come on.
Shh.
- You afraid?
- No.
Come on.
Hyah! Giddap! Hyah!
I'm sorry about what I done, Frank.
You might have been killed.
Well, I guess there ain't nothin' to be done about it now.
They'll be wanting me too.
I tell you, there isn't the slightest doubt about it.
I know a James boy job when I see one.
I ought to,
I've seen enough of them.
It was Frank James... and I'm offering another reward of $10,000.
I'll wipe him out, just like I did his brother.
Mr. McCoy, with your permission...
I should like to leave at once for the West.
- What for?
- To see if I can locate Charles and Bob Ford.
What have they got to do with it?
If I can find the Ford boys...
I've got a very good idea that
Frank James will not be far behind.
- Then go on, by all means.
- Thank you.
- There were two of them, weren't there?
- Yes, Mr. McCoy.
Yes. One of them was Frank, but who was the other?
Frank's got a lot of friends.
- Where's Jesse buried?
- Just outside of town.
You can laugh if you want to, but I'm going out and have a look at that grave.
I don't trust anything about those James boys.
Well, if it ain't Mr. Woodson.
- How are ya?
- Fine, sonny.
Where are you and your father been keeping yourselves?
Well, Pa got him a ranch down in old Mexico, just below the border.
- Like it down there?
- Oh, fine cattle country.
But you sure gotta be handy with a gun.
Shootin' scrapes all the time.
Guess who I seen killed in a fight just before I left.
- Who?
- Frank James.
Has he been down there?
 Yes, sir, and he's gonna stay
down there, six feet under the ground.
They must have pumped
15 slugs into him.
Well, he had it comin' to him, I reckon.
Let's go and have a drink.
I need one. I'm spittin' sand hills.
Wait till I get my saddlebags.
So, they finally got Frank.
Appears that way.
I done all right, huh?
Fine. I once seen Booth, and he couldn't acted it better.
Thanks. You think the news will get around?
Hope so. Once the Fords find out I'm dead... maybe they'll come out of their hole, wherever they are.
- Well, the Fords aren't the only ones—
- Shh.
The Fords aren't the only ones you gotta play dead for.
- McCoy's got a reward out.
- I know. I got a letter from the major.
McCoy's got an idea I had something to do with that express job.
Suspicious cuss, ain't he?
- Major write you they found out about the farm?
- No.
Well, they have.
McCoy's got a flock of men... watching every road and cow path around there.
I think it's all right though.
Pinky won't talk.
No, Pinky won't talk, but it's just as well I'm dead.
- What'll it be?
- Beer.
- And what for you?
- Make his sarsaparilla.
Right.
Now what'd you do that for?
I've tasted beer.
Mr. Woodson, sir.
Lady wants to see you.
- A lady?
- Yes, sir. She's waiting in the parlor.
Give me half a dollar to fetch ya.
- All right.
- This way, sir.
- Mr. Woodson?
- Yes, ma'am?
I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm looking for the man... who saw Frank James killed in Mexico.
And they told me he was talking to you on the porch.
It was me that seen the killing, ma'am.
- Oh, then it's you I wanna talk to.
- Just a minute, miss.
Who are you, if you don't mind?
My name's Eleanor Stone.
I'm a newspaper writer.
I was passing the hotel, and somebody told me that—
A writer? You mean you write pieces for the paper?
Yes, a reporter for the Denver Star.
A lady reporter?
Mind if I sit down?
It'll be easier for me to take notes.
Sure do beat all, a lady newspaperman.
Well, I'm not really and truly a reporter, not yet.
But I'm going to be.
My father's the owner of the Star.
Maybe you've heard of him—
Randolph Stone.
Well, can't say I have.
But if he owns the paper, I should think he'd be doing well enough... so his daughter don't have to work.
Oh, I don't have to work.
And, if you must know... my father's very much opposed to it.
He thinks I should finish college... and then sit around with my hands folded... waiting for someone to get around to marrying me.
I'll do nothing of the sort.
Women are awakening.
- They wanna do things. They—
- Not where I come from.
Women figure they're doing plenty feeding a dozen farmhands and raisin' kids.
We can't all feed farmhands and have babies.
Everybody to their taste.
I wanna be a newspaperwoman.
Now tell me about Frank James.
If I can get a good story, maybe my father will be convinced I can be a reporter.
Won't you help me?
Sure, we'll help.
Go ahead.
Tell her everything, son.
Well, it all happened about six weeks ago.
We'd been down in Hernandez herdin' longhorns.
And that night we went into town to do a little drinkin'.
- A boy like you?
- Ma'am, I ain't no boy.
Down in Mexico, I do a man's work
and a man's drinkin'!
When we got to Whiskey Joe's, there was a drunken crowd there from another ranch... a- roughin' things up.
Frank James— Oh, I've seen him a couple times before— he was up at the bar, drinkin' quiet and mindin' his own business.
You taking this down in that newfangled shorthand?
Oh, no, just making notes as I would in classes. Go ahead.
So, this crowd from the other ranch was a-whoopin' it up... especially the foreman, a fella they call Red—
Oh, like this— when a girl comes in the place.
Oh, a little girl, maybe 10 or 12, lookin' for her pa.
Red makes a grab for her, and she starts cryin' and a-screamin'.
And that plumb annoys Frank.
He comes over from the bar... and he pulls the girl away from Red and knocks him a-kickin'.
Right away I knows there's
gonna be trouble in bushel lots.
Everybody exceptin'Red's gang
runs out of the place.
It bein' none of my ruckus,
I ducks behind the bar.
But Frank don't scare any.
He pulls his gun and stands with his back up against the bar.
It's one against 12 or 15.
Red and his crew start blazin' away.
And Frank's blazin' right back.
He knocks off two guys... and then gets hit himself in the left arm.
Well, to make it short,
he finishes off Red.
Good. Good!
Better be takin' all this down, miss.
- It's all right. I'll remember.
- Uh, where was I?
Oh, yeah. He finishes off Red and five or six of his gang.
By this time, Frank himself is leakin' like a sieve.
He's down on the ground, dyin', but still fightin'... when a slug gets him in the heart.
Then the fellas that are left empty their guns into him.
- Oh, the cowards!
- This belonged to Frank.
See, it's marked F.J.
I picked it up figuring I could give it to his kinfolks if I ever run into them.
Oh, what a wonderful story for the paper.
Oh, yes, wonderful story.
Thank you. Thank you ever so much.
Oh, I must have your name.
Uh, Grayson. Tom Grayson.
Did you say this happened six weeks ago?
Then he couldn't have been mixed up in that Missouri express robbery... that I've been reading about, where a man was killed.
Oh, no, Frank had been in Mexico over a year.
Frank James never killed nobody.
Of course, I ain't countin' that Mexico business.
He and his brother must have been wonderfully colorful characters.
I wish I could have known him.
Well, I must hurry along to the paper.
Good-bye, and thank you so much.
I, uh— Sometimes I... might have news.
- Could I see you?
- I'd be glad to see you anytime.
You'll always be able to reach me at the Star... now.
Well, it's very good. But I still think a newspaper is no place for a woman.
- Now, now, dear, please don't be so severe.
- Edna, don't interfere.
But, Papa, you've got to admit... this is the biggest scoop you've had in six months.
Been telegraphed all over the country, and I got it for you.
No, my dear, you just stumbled on it.
That can happen to anybody.
- But I do go on the payroll, don't I?
- Thank you.
I don't know. I don't know.
I've got to think that over.
No, thank you.
Take the horses out by the side entrance and don't leave 'em.
- We may need them in a hurry.
- You goin' in?
Looks like a show I oughta see.
You gonna shoot 'em right on the stage?
No. First I'm just gonna scare 'em to death.
Well, it's time I was a-leavin'.
Where is that dratted valise of mine?
Here it is, Father.
All packed.
And I didn't forget your rheumatism medicine neither.
I hate to go leaving you alone,
Nellie, but I got to.
Uncle Joe's a-dyin'.
Don't worry, Pappy.
I'll be safe.
Nobody suspects the farm money's in this box.
And anyhow,
I know how to use this.
May God keep you safe, my daughter.
Go away.
There's nobody home.
 Open the door,
or we'll break it down.
Go away.
- We want the farm money.
- Take another step and I'll shoot.
- Oh, no, you won't. You know who we are?
- No, and I don't care.
I'm Jesse James.
This is my brother, Frank.
- Now, do we get the money?
- Over my dead body.
If that's the way you want it.
Help! Help!
Help! Help!
Help! Help!
Why didn't you do what I told you to?
- I wanted to see you give it to 'em.
- Where'd you put the horses?
Over there on the corner.
The theater's on fire!
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Come on!
Giddap! Giddap there!
Come on!
Giddap!
Come on!
That's one of'em, Jesse.
- I beg your pardon, but you're Miss Stone?
- Yes.
My name is Runyan.
I'm from the St. Louis Midland.
Oh, railroad police.
Won't you sit down?
Thank you.
I'm, uh, sorry to disturb you... but, uh, it's just a formality.
Uh, I'm checking up on the death of Frank James.
Uh, you wrote the story about it, didn't you?
Yes, I did.
Now I'm writing a story of his life.
Oh? Should be very interesting.
Very.
Um, that youngster who gave you the account of the killing... tell me about him.
- What did he look like?
- Look like?
Well, he was a boy not more than 16 or so.
Light, curly hair.
Turned-up nose.
That's about all I can tell you.
Ah, I see.
Um, in your story, there was something about a friend who was with the boy.
What did he look like?
Hmm, he was a man about 29 to 30... six feet tall, maybe more.
Hard to tell.
Walks with a sort of stoop.
Has blue eyes and rather high cheekbones.
Speaks with a slow drawl, but doesn't say much.
Yes. What did you say his name was?
Woodson. Ben Woodson.
Woodson. He here now?
No. They told me over at the hotel that he'd suddenly been called away on business.
But I'm sure he'll be back soon.
At any rate, you hope so.
Yes, I do.
He's most likable.
Yes.
I guess women could find a certain something about Frank.
- Frank?
- Your friend Woodson...
- is Frank James.
- What did you say?
I said your likable friend is Frank James, outlaw and murderer.
You—You can't mean it.
Isn't this your friend Woodson?
But I don't understand.
Why should—
It's all very simple, my dear.
You see, Frank had two very good reasons for wanting to be dead:
The express robbery in Missouri and his friends, the Fords.
I don't believe it.
He wouldn't do that.
He was so nice and helpful.
- You sure there's no mistake?
- Oh, quite.
You see, right after reading your story,
I went down to the border.
 Nobody there had ever heard
of the gunfight that boy told you about.
I'm sorry, my dear.
You were the victim of a very cruel hoax.
You and your paper.
However, all hardened criminals are cruel and vicious.
Uh, you said he was coming back?
That's what they told me at the hotel...
- but now that the news is out—
- But the news isn't out.
Only the two of us
know about Woodson.
Well, uh, I'll be leaving you now.
But you'll hear from me very soon.
And don't worry, my dear, you will have the last laugh.
- Mose?
- Yes, miss?
- There's something I want you to do for me.
- Yes'm.
- You remember that man you took the message to last week?
- You mean Mr. Woodson?
Yes. Now here's what I want you to do.
He's away now, but when he comes back to the hotel... tell him not to go inside, not to talk to anybody... or to see anybody until he gets in touch with me.
- Understand?
- Yes'm.
This Mr. Woodson ain't on no account to do nothing until he done seen you.
All right, Mose, but remember, it's important—very, very important—
and be sure—
Look! Look at it, Frank.
A hair. A real hair.
See it?
Yeah, feel it. Feel it.
Couple more like that, and you'll need a mustache cup, son.
Hands up, gentlemen.
Well, this is a real pleasure, Frank.
I haven't seen you since that little affair at Northfield.
Oh, come now.
Don't act that way. Be sociable.
How about a little of that charm you loosed on that lady reporter, huh?
Oh, you're quite a storyteller,
aren't you, bub?
Yeah. All right, put on your boots and your coats... and we'll make a little call on the marshal.
Come on.
Guess you're wondering
how I caught up with you, huh?
Very, very simple.
I knew that Mexican story was a fake the minute I read it.
Showed a picture of you
to Miss Stone, and there you are.
Yes, you lawbreakers are all just about the same.
Oh, some of you are smarter
than others, but sooner or later...
you'll all trip yourselves up!
I did good, didn't I?
Yes, son, this time you sure did.
Take a deep breath, missy.
Boyjust left this for you.
Tell my mother
I may be late for dinner.
A friend of mine's ill.
Going over to see her.
Yes'm.
Come in.
Come in!
Help! Police! Help! Help!
Come out or I'll shoot!
Try to commit suicide, huh?
Huh?
Yeah, that's how it was. Didn't mean to lie, but there was nothing else I could do.
- I'm awfully sorry l—
- And you should be.
Taking advantage of a young girl... and hanging up people in closets like raincoats.
But you can't stay here.
You've got to get away.
If you don't, they'll be hanging you like they're hanging your friend.
- Friend? What friend?
- Didn't you read about it?
The paper gives his name as Pinky.
- Pinky something or other.
- What?
Here, I cut it out.
Why, they're plumb loco.
Pinky wasn't even in town when it happened.
I sent him back to the farm.
They can't hang him.
He's already been found guilty...
- and sentenced.
- But he's innocent.
He's as innocent as you are.
Some of McCoy's work.
His way of getting back at me.
Pinky never so much as even stole a chicken in his whole life.
- What are you going to do?
- I gotta do something.
I- I wanna talk to you.
Go ahead.
You can talk in front of her.
- Well, it's about Bob Ford.
I found out where he is.
- Yeah?
Mining camp called Creede.
About four or five days' ride from here.
Some fellas at the livery stable were talking about him.
- Get out the horses. I'll be right with you.
- All right.
So, you're going to let your friend hang after all.
What? Well, there's nothin'
I can do about it now.
- Once I get Bob Ford out—
- But you'll be too late.
If you'll look at the clipping, you'll see the hanging's set for next week.
I know, but what can I do?
Tell me, is it more important for you to kill a man... than to save the life of an innocent one?
Nothing's more important to me than gettin' Bob Ford.
I'll send a telegram to the governor.
I'll tell him Pinky's innocent.
Promise to give myself up the minute I've taken care of Ford.
But anyone could send a telegram and sign your name.
You've got to go yourself... now.
Frank, you can't do anything else.
Killing is one thing, but letting an innocent man die—
I know, and I agree with you, but it may be my only chance.
I promise you once I get Bob Ford,
I'll give myself up.
Good-bye, Eleanor.
Come in.
Oh, so it's you.
Close that door and sit down. I've got
a few things to say to you, young lady.
All right, Papa.
Get it over with.
Uh-huh. I suppose you realize you've made me and the Star...
- the laughingstock of the country.
- I'm sorry.
Oh, I suppose you think that takes care of everything.
- Other papers have made mistakes.
- Yes, but none of them... have made the mistake of having a gullible female on their staff and trusting her.
None of them have—
You saw that interview with Runyan in the Globe this morning, didn't you?
- Yes, I saw it.
- Uh-huh. It's all true, isn't it?
- Not altogether.
- Oh, no?
Didn't Runyan come to see you?
Didn't Frank James hang him up in the closet?
Ha. I suppose you'll be telling me next
that Frank James is really dead.
I could hardly tell you that.
I talked to him last night.
You saw him?
That murderer, and you didn't turn him in?
Young lady, you're going back to college tomorrow.
I've had enough of your nonsense.
My daughter mixed up with murderers.
Papa, I've got to go to Liberty, Missouri.
You bet you do.
What? What's that?
Did you read a story in your paper about a Negro named Pinky... who's going to be hanged in a few days as an accomplice in the express robbery?
- Yes, yes. What about it?
- Well, he's innocent, and—
What's that got to do with you?
Have you gone out of your mind?
How do you know he's innocent?
If you'll stop standing on your head and sit down...
I'll tell you how I know and why I've got to go to Liberty.
- Makes good eatin'—wild hen. Don't it?
- Mm-hmm.
'Course... it didn't get the fine cookin'
Pinky had've given—
- I can't do it, Clem.
- Can't do what?
- Can't go on.
- What's the matter? You sick?
Yeah, sick inside.
In a few days they'll be hangin' Pinky.
Hangin' him for something he didn't do.
Must have been crazy.
I'm goin' back, Clem.
- And let Bob Ford get away?
- Let Bob Ford get away.
Well, you can't do it, Frank.
You can't.
After all our work, are we gonna give up on account of a darky?
We're goin', Clem.
It ain't Pinky makin' you do this.
It's that girl in Denver.
You got her on your mind more than you have Bob Ford.
In a few seconds, you're gonna have an awful sore seat, son.
Maybe I am, but what would Jesse think if he knew you were walkin' out on him?
That's enough, Clem.
I guess she's afraid you're gonna get hurt.
"Oh, don't go, Frank.
That poor Ford boy"—
I'm goin', Clem, and I'm goin' alone.
Frank! Frank!
Frank!
- Can I go with you?
- Suit yourself.
- What you doin'that for?
- We're honest men, Clem.
Yeah, but tain't a fair swap.
Why, I could get—
Maybe you could, son. Maybe you could, but we got no time for tradin' talk.
Pick out a couple of good head.
Hey, stranger. How much you figure an outfit like this is worth?
Oh, about $500 or $600.
Here's $600.
I'll throw in the horses.
Come on, Clem.
- Anything wrong?
- No, exceptin' that outfit don't belong to me.
When's the next through train east?
Just missed it.
Won't be another till tomorrow.
It's no good. We gotta be in Kansas City tomorrow.
You can make up your mind you ain't gonna be.
Those trains there—
Them's freights, all except number eight. That's fast mail.
- Due in a few minutes, ain't it?
- Yeah.
But it don't even—
Whistle goin' through here.
- You can flag it, can't you?
- What, flag number eight?
What for?
It don't carry passengers.
Only mail and fast express.
You're gonna flag it tonight, partner.
Come on. Get your lantern.
- Come on. Get goin'. Get goin'.
- Y-Yes, sir.
I guess you know you can be arrested for this.
- Federal offense, stoppin' a mail train.
- Yeah, we know. Go on. Go on.
I'm goin'. I'm goin'.
Take it easy.
Engineer's gonna be mighty surprised.
Mail ain't stopped here in the 10 years it's been runnin'.
Keep swingin', brother.
Keep swingin'.
Y- Yes, sir.
- Hey, what's the trouble?
- What's the mat— Holy smoke. It's a holdup.
It ain't a holdup.
We just wanna ride with you.
Get goin'. Don't stop till you get to Kansas City, no matter what.
Get in the cab with him, Clem.
Hold her open, brother.
I'm comin' in with you.
Sorry, miss, but there ain't no reason.
But there is a reason, a good reason.
Frank James is liable to come in any day now... and when he does, you'll hear the truth from his own lips.
I see. So you want us to hold up the hanging while Frank is out murdering another man.
No. I want you to wait, to keep from murdering a man.
Pinky's not guilty. I know it, and I think you know it too.
What harm would there be in postponing?
What for? To give Frank James a chance to raise a gang... and raid the jail like he did once before?
That's it! That's what the scheme is, and you're part of it!
- You're a fool, McCoy, and a dad-blasted liar!
- Now, now, Major.
A liar and a sneaky little coward to boot.
You couldn't get at Frank... so you're striking at him through his poor helpless Negro boy.
- You and your perjured witnesses and this weak-kneed—
- There's nothing to be done here.
Why, for two cents I'd take you out and shoot you down like a dog...
you dad-blasted Yankee scum!
I couldn't stay.
In an hour it'll all be over... and I want to be as far away as I can.
- I understand, my dear, and I'm sorry.
- It's all right, Major.
You've been very kind, but I'll never understand your people.
No, you'd have to live among us a long time to do that.
Now don't think too badly of Frank, because he—
He and I and all of us around here—
Well, we've been brought up to right our own wrongs, regardless of everything.
And what about the wrong being done Pinky?
If you ever see Frank James again,
tell him I think he's low and contemptible.
Only a selfish brute
would let an innocent man die.
Well, good-bye, Major, and—
- Good-bye, my dear.
- Thank you again.
Frank! Did you get him?
- No.
- Oh, the dirty rotten coward!
- I knew you'd come.
- Did you?
Yes. Behind all my doubts, there was always a feeling that—
Put 'em up, Frank...
and keep 'em up.
I see you finally got out of that closet all right.
Oh, yes. And now let's see you get out of a rope around your neck. Put 'em on.
Goin' to an awful lot of bother, ain't you?
Oh, no bother. It's a pleasure—
A real pleasure.
Uh, where's that young friend of yours?
Hidin' out, but I just can't remember where.
I see. All right, get along.
Frank?
Good morning, Miss Stone.
L—
Oh, I'm sorry, miss, but this table is reserved for reporters.
- But I am a reporter.
I represent the Denver Star.
- Denver Star?
- Mr. Runyan.
- Thank you, sir. Ah, good luck.
This case?
Tain't too late, Frank, if you want to get another lawyer.
I haven't practiced in nigh unto 20 years... not since I took over the Gazette, and I may be a mite rusty.
Ah, rusty or not, you can do as much for me as any other lawyer... and I reckon that ain't hardly anything at all.
Maybe so, maybe so.
But we ain't quittin'.
McCoy and that gosh-dinged
Yankee prosecutor of his... will be breathin' mighty heavy before I'm through with them.
Order in the court!
Order in the court!
Everybody stand.
Court is now in session.
Hear ye—
That ain't the regular judge, is it?
No, that's Ferris. They brought him on from St. Louis.
- Just to make sure, eh?
- Uh-huh.
...is now in session. Be seated.
Your Honor, the case
on the docket is number 4358.
State of Missouri v. Frank James.
You may proceed.
Not only did he rob the express office... but we will prove beyond the slightest peradventure of a doubt... that the defendant, Frank James... in keeping with his long, murderous career—
I object! The defendant's not on trial in this court for a long, murderous career... any more than the prosecuting attorney is charged... with being in the pay of the St. Louis Midland Railway.
- I resent the innuendo!
- Then stick to the charges in the indictment!
- I'm not asking you, sir, what—
- Gentlemen! Gentlemen!
Gentlemen!
Now, gentlemen, I propose to have this trial conducted in a quiet and orderly manner.
The prosecutor will confine himself to the matter contained in the true bill.
And you, sir, will refrain from personalities.
Thejury will ignore
the exchange between counsel.
We are not concerned with crimes other
than those mentioned in the indictment.
And we certainly are not concerned...
with the railroad associations
of the prosecuting attorney.
I object, Your Honor.
There have been no associations.
I am not aware that I have said there were. You may proceed.
The State will prove... not only did the defendant rob the express office... but also that he shot down the watchman, Wilson, in cold blood.
The State calls its first
witness, Sheriff Daniels.
Sheriff Daniels.
You say Frank James admitted robbing the express office.
Yes, he did, and before witnesses.
I didn't ask you before whom.
You just answer my questions.
That'll be enough of a strain on that giant intellect of yours.
- Did Frank James also admit killing the watchman?
- No.
- He denied it.
- Yes.
He said Dan was killed by a shot from the outside.
- How long you been sheriff?
- Two years.
Before that, what'd you do?
I object, Your Honor!
What possible bearing... can the former occupation of the witness have on this trial?
I see no objection to the question.
You may answer it.
- I was in charge of... special police.
- Who for?
- St. Louis Midland Railway.
- Louder! And speak to the jury.
- St. Louis Midland Railway.
- That's all.
Your Honor, I must take exception to this line of questioning.
My learned opponent, in his desperation... is trying to make it appear that the railroad company... and not the state of Missouri is prosecuting this defendant.
- The court is under no deception.
- Oh, of that I'm quite certain.
But that there be no doubt in the minds of the jury...
I am about to produce five witnesses— none of whom is connected even remotely with the Midland— who were present when Frank James confessed.
Tain't necessary. We admit Frank James robbed the express office.
- That's the case.
- Yep. Thought the major would talk about duress or something.
- Or at least make the State prove it.
- Why, certainly.
- What are you doing here?
- I had to come.
Anyhow, there ain't no sense in me hidin' out. Nobody's worryin' about me.
- How's it goin' in there?
- Not so well.
Suppose it'd do Frank any good if I was to tell them the robbery was my idea?
No. No, there's nothing you or I or anybody can do.
We've just got to wait and hope.
Yeah? Well, we wouldn't be doin' no hopin' or waitin' if it wasn't for you.
Why didn't you leave Frank alone?
What'd you have to keep after him for?
If you hadn't stuck your nose in it... we'd have got Bob Ford and nobody'd got Frank.
Now, on account of you, they're gonna hang him.
Raise your right hand, place your left hand on the Bible. Do you swear to tell the truth... the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
- I do.
- Sit down.
- You're Frank James?
- No doubt about that.
Why are you here?
- Why?
- Yeah. You weren't captured.
- You weren't brought in on a fugitive warrant.
- I come in.
In other words, you're here voluntarily, eh?
As far as the State's concerned, you might still be at large.
I object.
That is a conclusion!
Objection sustained.
The witness will not be asked to speculate. You may proceed.
You came in voluntarily.
Why?
Well, they was aimin' to swing Pinky for somethin' he didn't do— something he didn't even know anything about— so I figured that—
So you figured you'd risk your own neck to save the life of a poor, innocent old darky.
Your Honor, I must protest!
I must protest, Your Honor.
The witness isn't being asked to give testimony. He's being led into argument.
The point is well-taken, but when a man is on trial for his life... the court is inclined to give wide latitude to the defense.
Now take it easy, Major. You'll have plenty of opportunity to make arguments.
- You needn't do it through the witness.
- I stand rebuked, Your Honor.
You did rob the express office, didn't you?
- Reckon I did.
- Mm-hmm. What'd you do with the money?
- Used it huntin' the Fords.
- No other purpose?
No. It was McCoy money got Jesse murdered, so I took McCoy money.
- Your Honor!
- Major, I want to be fair with you.
In fact, I've been leaning over backwards to be fair, but—
It's all right, Your Honor. I'm finished with the witness. McCoy can have him. I-I—
I mean— I mean, uh— I mean McCoy's man.
No, no, no, doggone it.
I— I mean the prosecuting attorney.
- I'm— I'm sorry, Your Honor, but my tongue got twisted.
- You say you didn't kill the watchman, Wilson.
- I had no reason.
- Do you always need a reason for killing?
- Don't you?
I'm not on trial. Your accomplice could've shot Wilson, couldn't he?
- Yeah, could have.
- Ah.
But he didn't.
Shot from the outside got Wilson.
I suggest that you caused the death of the watchman... either directly or by using him as a shield in making your escape.
Can't arrest you for suggestin', but tain't so.
Tell me... just where was the watchman,
Wilson, when he was hit?
Well, let me see. I think he—
Never mind what you think.
Where was he?
Sorry. I can't talk without thinkin', not bein' a lawyer.
Your name is
Breckenridge Jackson?
- Colonel Breckenridge Jackson, sir.
- Well, Colonel Jackson.
- Colonel Breckenridge Jackson, sir.
- Well, Colonel Jackson.
You say that you've known
Frank James for many years.
- Are you doubtin' my word, sir?
- I merely asked you a question, sir.
I answered for my friend, the major... and you, sir, were in the room at the same time.
- Are you deef?
- My hearing is perfectly good.
Very well. Then I advise you, sir, to pay attention to what's goin' on in this here courtroom.
Please answer all questions put to you, directly and without discussion.
- As a character witness—
- I shall do as you wish, sir.
There is no favor I can refuse the man who led the courageous attack at Ball's Bluff.
- All right, all right, but let's get on.
- Very well, sir.
What do you want to know, Yankee?
Now, Colonel—
When did you first meet Frank James?
As a boy of 14 or 15, when he first joined up.
- You mean when he joined Quantrill's guerrillas?
- Guerrillas?
- Did I hear you say guerrillas?
- I believe they're generally known as such.
Only to those who cravenly fled before them.
The finest cavalry in war, sir.
The flower of Southern horse.
- Why, at the battle ofThree Oaks—
- Come, come, come.
Let's get on with the trial.
Am I to tolerate insults to the South?
Well, I don't feel insulted.
The next question.
I did have a number of questions to ask this witness, Your Honor... but rather than refight the entire rebellion—
Rebellion, did you say, sir?
If you are, by any chance... referring to the late unpleasantness between the States... that, sir, was a war for the Southern Confederacy.
That isn't what they call it where I come from.
Well, that's what this court calls it, and let the record so show.
- You may proceed.
- State rests.
Yankee.
As to the robbery itself,
I need say nothing.
Frank James admits that with an unknown accomplice, he broke into the express office... cracked open the strongbox and escaped with the contents.
May I assume that even my learned opponent will agree... that breaking into a place and robbing it is a punishable offense.
- Go on, talk to the jury.
They have to listen to you.
But Frank James's crime did not end with robbery.
There was murder as well—
foul, bloody murder...
murder that cries aloud for
justice against its perpetrator.
Frank James killed the watchman, Wilson... and you, as honest men... will see that he pays for his crime at the end of a rope.
- It's all my fault.
- I wouldn't feel that way about it if I was you.
After all, you only did what you thought was right.
When I talked to Frank in Denver...
I was thinking only of an innocent man condemned to death.
I didn't think that perhaps
I was sending Frank to his death.
- What business was it of mine?
- Now listen, Frank's not going to his death.
Ten years, I figure, maybe 15.
If I only hadn't persuaded him.
My dear, I'm afraid you're overcalculatin' your powers of persuasion.
You figure it was your persuasion that made him come in, don't you, huh?
Well, you're mistaken.
He'd have come in and when he did, even if he'd never met you.
You're saying that to make feel better.
No, no, no. I'm not.
I'm saying it because it's the truth.
Frank would never have let Pinky die.
You see, l— I know him better than you do.
Well, it's time to be gettin' back to court.
Come along.
You see, I think—
Frank had only one thought:
To avenge the cowardly murder of his brother Jesse.
But to get on the track of the Fords
he needed money, and he had none.
- You boys know how rich you get workin' a rocky Ozark farm.
So, in desperation, and only as a last resort, did Frank turn to robbery.
But let us see.
Did he rob a bank containing the thrifty savings of the poor? No.
Did he rob an honest shopkeeper? No.
He took money from the railroad... the railroad that had caused the death of his mother and his brother.
The railroad that stole your lands and drove you from your farms, the railroad—
- I object!
- Your objection is well-taken.
Now let me remind you,
Major, again.
The St. Louis Midland is not on trial in this court.
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
Now just try and forget what I said about the railroad.
And there is no evidence whatsoever that Wilson, the night watchman... was killed by a bullet from a.44.
There is more than a reasonable doubt about it... since even the autopsy surgeon himself couldn't tell.
Now this is the weapon Frank James had when he surrendered... and the weapon he has always carried.
I know 'cause I gave it to him myself the day he went to join Quantrill.
You see the initials on it— F.J. — and the date. Here. See here. Here.
- This is very irregular, Your Honor.
The evidence is in.
- Let him proceed.
Your Honor.
This weapon of Frank's has a very interesting history. Yes, sir, right from the start.
Its first bullets were fired at those dad-blasted Kansas jayhawkers... when they come a-raidin' here.
You remember that, don't you, Ira?
Next, this weapon was used on the sneakin', thievin' Yankees that burned Hickoryville.
Saved your barn and your horses, eh, Luke?
What are we trying here, Frank James or his gun?
This is also the weapon that stampeded the blasted blue-bellies at Three Oaks... and cleared Clay County forever of the pesky invaders.
Now tell them how many innocent men that gun laid low.
There is no innocent blood on this weapon.
I'm proud of every bullet fired from it. This weapon—
L— I'm sorry, Your Honor. L—
I didn't know it was loaded.
Perhaps your client didn't either when he fired at the watchman.
And if the jury believe that any witness has willfully sworn falsely...
to any material fact,
thejury is at liberty to discard...
and disregard the testimony
of such witness.
And in determining
the credibility of any witness...
thejury may take into consideration
his or her moral character...
as disclosed by the evidence
developed at the trial.
And if on account ofhis or her moral
turpitude or other criminal acts...
if any, thejury regard him or her
as untrustworthy ofbelief.'...
they are at liberty to disregard
and reject the whole of such testimony...
although a part ofhis other testimony...
may be corroborated
by other evidence in the case.
- Fifth—
- What's he doing here?
Thejury is instructed
that by the statutes of—
- What's he doing here?
- Guess he wants to be in at the kill.
 That is the law,
gentlemen, and here are the facts.
The defendant admits—yes, freely admits
that he robbed the express office.
Not now, son. Not now!
Thus your duty as to that count
in the indictment is plain. Uh—
As to the defendant's reasons for robbing the express office... you will attach no weight to them whatever.
As to whether murder was committed
in the course of the robbery...
that you will determine
by the evidence.
But bear this in mind: No matter
what has been said in this courtroom... you and you only are the final judges of the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
The jury will now retire to its deliberations.
Maybe not murder, but there's no question of a conviction on the robbery charge.
I wish, though, that Bob Ford hadn't come here.
- Your Honor?
- Yes?
- Do we have to leave the box?
- Not if you've reached a verdict.
- We have, Your Honor.
- And what is the verdict?
We find the defendant,
Frank James, not guilty of anything.
We licked them, the dad-blasted Yankees!
We licked them!
Let go ofhim, you lunkheads!
Keep cool, son. Keep cool.
Please! Please!
You're free, Frank, free!
You can do as you please, go where you want.
If you kill him, you'll have to stand trial again.
- You mustn't, Frank. You mustn't!
- I got to.
Frank, if you ever want to see me again—
Bob Ford! They got him!
They got him!
I tried to get him for you, Frank, but...
'pears like he got me.
I think I plugged him too, but I ain't sure.
If I was,
I wouldn't feel so bad.
- Anybody gettin' a doctor?
- He's coming.
- Frank?
- Yeah?
I guess you and Pinky can take care of the farm.
No, we can't, Clem. We got to have you.
We need you for the harvestin'.
Ain't a man in the county can do a day's work like you. We gotta have you.
All right, Frank, but... I'm awful tired.
Maybe if— if I rest up a bit—
Buck up, son. You can't go to sleep now.
You got a job to do.
Clem.
Anybody see which way Ford went?
Yeah, he ducked in that livery barn over there.
Are you comin' out, or am I comin' in?
That's the other one, Jesse.
"In granting a full pardon to Frank James...
"he has shown himself to be a man...
"who acts in full accord...
"with the wishes of the people.
"Anybody who don't vote for him...
"at the next election...
- ought to be taken out"—
- "And shot down like a dog."
Yeah. Huh? Yeah, and put it on the front page in 12-point boldface.
I don't suppose you'll ever get out to Denver again.
Oh, can't tell.
Mighty pretty country 'round there.
Yeah, it kind of does somethin' to you... to see the sun come up mornings over the mountains.
- Yep, there's lots I like about Denver.
- I'm glad.
- Good-bye.
- Bye.
There ain't nothin' steady about a woman, Stokes.
Their minds is as changeable as the moon.
Yeah. And there's always a man in it.
Man in the moon,Juke, get it?
No. My Pearl ain't like that.
You and Pearl figure on holy matrimony?
She don't like my whiskers. Then why don't you whack them off?
Oh, Pearl wants me to, but I keep thinkin' about Samson.
You mean Samson, the little tailor in Albuquerque?
No, you heathen.
Samson was a king.
Lived in Egypt or " Afrikee" or someplace like that. Well, what about him?
Well, he had a mane and whiskers just like mine.
Strongest fella you ever seen.
Pushed buildings over with his bare hands. Yes, sir.
He had a gal, too, named Delilah.
Didn't she like whiskers either?
No, sir.
Snuck in one night, clipped Samson slicker than a frog's belly.
After that he was so durn weak, couldn't even break a toothpick.
You're an awfully sweet little girl,
Miss Myrtle, and it won't be long before you meet your daddy in Albuquerque.
Oh, Mr. Cole, you're so funny.
Isn't he, Miss Wallace?
Yes, honey, very amusing,
Amusing? He's funny.
Isn't he, Mr. Martin?
Very funny. Yes, sir, he's a regular circus. Certainly is.
Thank you, ma'am, ladies.
I aim to please.
You know, Miss Myrtle, if I was gonna see the man I love most,
I'd try to get some sleep so's to look fresh and pretty when he meets me.
My daddy don't care how I look, just so I get there.
Shouldn't wonder, ma'am, if the same advice wouldn't work for you too.
You haven't closed your eyes since we left the railroad. I'm fine, thank you.
Whoa!
All right, come out a-jumpin' and reach for nothin' but sky. Everybody but the kid.
Throw your guns overboard and come down out of there.
We ain't got no gun and we ain't got no box. Get down!
All right, everybody, line up!
And don't anybody try anything!
Come on, get over there!
Well, missy, what have you got there? Nothing.
I'll have a look at that satchel.
No!
Boy, I got the tiger by the tail!
A tiger by the tail!
Fine way to make a livin', robbin' women. Shut up!
You're next. That's not my money. It's collections.
It belongs to-
Shut up!
Whoa, horses! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa!
Come on, boy!
Come on, Mr. Cole! Come on!
Whoa, horses! Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Myrtle?
Oh, Mr. Cole, you were elegant!
I bet this old coach had a mighty scared little passenger.
I was at first, but I ain't now.
All right, you get back inside and we'll pick up Miss Celia and the others.
No, sir.
I wanna ride up there with you.
All right, up we go.
Here comes the stage!
Where you goin',Juke?
Where's the Sheriff?
We've been robbed! Sheriff!
Help you down?
Myrtle! Honey!
Daddy!
Look here, let me through here.
Celia. Oh, you're good. Oh, Ted.
Let me look at you.
How's my kid sister?
Ted. Dear, what's the matter?
Did you hear what the driver said?
We were held up.
Did they get the money?
Our $10,000, Ted. All of it.
Ten thousand dollars?
Mr. Cole?
What is it, honey?
I told Daddy how you knocked a bandit down... and caught the runaway and saved my life.
I'm mighty obliged to you, mister.
If you ever need a friend in Albuquerque, you got one. Thanks. I'll remember that.
Durn funny, Sheriff. First stage holdup in months. Why'd they pick on my run?
I wasn't carryin' nothin', not even a gun rider.
Why'd they kill that poor fella in there?
Keep quiet,Juke. Now who were the passengers in this coach?
Well, I was drivin'. There was that lady and this fella here, the little gal and that big fella over there and the dead man.
All right, the rest of you scatter.
Go on! Go on about your business!
You look intelligent, mister. I'm the sheriff, and I'd like to know what happened out there.
Five men held up the stage, a man was killed and this lady here lost $10,000.
What's she carryin' that kind of money around for?
I wouldn't think that concerned you or me. If I were wearing that badge, I'd get a posse and go after them.
I didn't ask you how to run my office.
And if you want to stay in this town, you'd better let me run it.
Hank! Get a couple of men, take care of this body.
And round up my deputies and have them meet me here.
Remember what I said about needin' a friend.
Good-bye, Mr. Cole.
Good-bye, Myrtle.
I'm sorry about all that money.
Thank you.
Mr. Cole, I want you to meet my brother, Ted Wallace. Mr. Wallace.
We've all got a lot to be grateful to you for, Mr. Cole.
Your sister has the name wrong. It's
Cole Armin. I'm here to work for my uncle.
John Armin?
Yeah. That's right.
What's the matter with those folks?
You'd think I had smallpox.
Son, I'd rather have smallpox than the name of Armin in this town.
Go on, keep talking.
All right, Mr. Armin, here it is.
There's a crowd of men gathering at the jail right now, yelling their heads off, demanding action.
That coach brought a dead body in.
That's murder!
All right. I ordered Matt Wayne to get that Wallace girl's $10,000.
If carrying out that order involved a killing, that was part of his job.
Well, I could cover up the robbery, but killing, that's something else.
Take the outraged citizens on a horseback tour, Linton.
And, Murkil.
Murkil. Murkil!
Get Wayne and his men out of town.
You got it?
Got it.
I'm tellin' you the boss is busy and don't want to be disturbed. Now go on and sit down.
I'm telling you again
I want to see him.
What's all the racket? Ah, this office boy says I can't seeJohn Armin.
You're lookin' at him.
Why, you're notJohn Armin by 30 years.
Have you ever seen him?
Yeah, a long time ago.
How do you know I ain't him?
By the size of your ears.
That's gonna get you thrown out on yours. Murkil!
Who are you?
I came to seeJohn Armin.
I'm John Armin.
What do you want?
I'm here to take that job you offered me. What's your name?
I was wonderin' when somebody'd get around to that. I'm Cole Armin.
Welcome, Cole.
Welcome to Albuquerque.
Get going, Murkil.
This is Ed Linton, our sheriff.
Yes. I met him down at the jail. I thought you were gettin' up a posse, Sheriff.
I gave you some good advice down there.
If you're smart, you'll take it.
That's why he's here, Cole. Wants to borrow some of my men to go with him.
You know, in Texas, if the law don't move fast enough, a rope and a tree is the payoff for robbin' women and cold-blooded shootin'.
I'd be glad to go along, Sheriff. Now you stay here, Cole. We've got some talking to do.
Get what men you need from the yard,
Linton. Better get going.
Come on in, nephew.
We've got to have a little talk.
Just sit down and make yourself comfortable. Thanks.
Quite a place you got here.
Uh-huh. Well, how do you think you're gonna like your new job?
I can answer that when
I find out what the job is.
Well, I wouldn't send to Texas for a mule skinner, Cole.
You're stepping in to a manager's job.
Manager?
Yeah. Help yourself.
I've got a big enterprise here.
A transportation outfit that hauls most of the ore down from the mines.
I've done the spade work... and the money's rolling in- big money- but I'm getting tired.
You aim to let me run all that?
Soon as you learn the ropes.
Now the teamster is the toughest man alive, respects nobody he can lick.
And that covers a lot of territory.
It takes plenty of brains and brawn to handle them. Sounds interesting,
And we have to fight for contracts too.
That's where everything goes, no holds barred. Why did you pick me?
Because you're an Armin.
Oh.
And with another Armin in the saddle,
I can see my empire spreading beyond the borders of the Territory of New Mexico.
When do I start?
You've already started.
But you'll wanna clean up a little, I guess. Uh-huh.
Get a room in my hotel, then come back here.
Thanks. Thanks, UncleJohn.
I'll try to measure up to all that.
Now I want you to hit the Rio Grande bottoms south of town.
Spread out and comb the timber, Harry.
All right, Sheriff.
Here we go, men.
¶¶
¶¶
Hi, old-timer.
Hi.
I didn't know you were a drinking man.
Ordinarily I ain't, but right now I'm desperate.
Mr. Armin, there comes a time in life when a man just has to have a drink.
You're lookin' at a man seekin' courage, comfort and confidence.
You'll never find it in there.
I'm gonna keep on lookin'.
I've been humbled, humiliated, disgraced and discombobulated, Mr. Armin.
Cole's the name. Howdy,
Cole. Mine's Juke.
Howdy,Juke.
What's eating you?
Pearl- fairest of the fair in all Albuquerque... and the best durn barber in the territory.
Oh. Lady barber?
I called her that once. She run me down the street with a razor.
She says she's a tonsorial artist.
Kind of high-toned, huh?
High-toned? Swell-headed.
Has been ever since she shaved the governor last year.
She'd really be tough on you if she ever shaved the president.
Cole, that woman's tried to shave me every day for nine years.
Says I ain't doin' her business no good.
If everybody was like me, she'd starve to death,
Everybody plays.
On double-O.
So this is what's holdin' you up?
I told you before that the boss said for you and your men to get out of town.
All right.
Jackson, cash these in.
We're headin' north to White Spring Canyon.
Make your bets, gents. All right, everybody plays. All put down together.
Everything goes on number 12.
On number 12.
You gettin' the same idea I am?
Yeah.
Number 12.
Yahoo! I won!
I got the tiger by the tail!
Seems to me we've heard that before.
We have.
Come on, pay up.
I got the tiger by the tail!
Come on, fella, we're gonna have a talk.
Speak your piece.
I'm stayin' right where I am.
That's a nasty cut.
Kind of fresh too.
Hold it, mister.
Get back there, all of you!
You too!
This is private and personal between my friend and that scorpion there.
If living means anything to you, you got a lot of talking to do. Let go of me!
Come on, there!
Come on, let me through there!
Open up! That scorpion's gonna have a little talk with my partner... or he ain't gonna twist no more tiger's tail.
Well, it didn't take you long.
I want Miss Wallace's $10,000.
What are you talking about?
You know what I'm talking about.
The money your thugs took off of that girl on the stagecoach.
Oh, you know about that?
Yes.
Supposing they did? The Wallaces are our competitors, Cole.
And you'd rob a woman, kill an innocent man to destroy them?
The law of self-preservation applies to business too.
The competition has got to be strangled.
So the end justifies the means?
That's not important.
Life is cheap out here.
The money itself had no value to me... as money.
But don't you see, Cole? It would have set Wallace up as a dangerous threat to us.
I'm building a big business here that'll be yours someday.
Wallace's 10,000 got in my way, so I removed it.
Now I understand why our name is poison in Albuquerque.
You're too emotional,just like your father. That's why he died poor.
Never mind that.
I want that girl's money.
I don't stand for threats, Cole.
And if you got any ideas of calling on the law, it'll be your word against mine.
What about the word of your hired killer?
- He won't talk.
- If he don't want to shake hands with sudden death, he'll talk.
There's a mob with a rope looking for you.
You want to talk to them or to the law?
Take him to the sheriff,Juke.
Tell him I said to lock him up.
I wish Pearl was here to see what a useful citizen I've turned out to be.
Come on, get movin'.
Let's you and I have another little talk, eh, Cole?
Do you want to save any of these, Ted?
No, burn 'em all up. I don't want to save a scrap of anything to remind me of this place or anybody in it.
How do you suppose Mr. Armin knew
I was bringing the money?
He's got connections all over this territory.
And his nephew being on the same stage wasn't just a coincidence.
Just because his name is Cole Armin doesn't convict him with me.
Look... instead of using the money we have left to go home, couldn't we make a fresh start here?
What with? The only start we can make, honey, is back home, or go to work forJohn Armin.
Armin! Armin! Armin!
That's all I've heard since I got here.
Albuquerque could grow into a big city someday, and you could grow with it.
It's the fear of his power that's strangling you and everybody else in this town.
I not gonna stand by and watch you quit.
Is this the Wallace Freighting Company?
Ted! It was the Wallace Freighting Company.
You've got nothing to say that we want to hear. Get out!
Miss Celia, I don't want to fight any more today.
Will you ask your brother to sit down and listen?
Sit down, Ted.
I came here thinking you might need some help. What kind of help?
I could learn to drive mules. Is this another one of your uncle's schemes?
Well, I just came from him, but he didn't send me.
I'm interested in this town and its possibilities.
Matter of fact, I'm looking for a job.
You heard what my sister said.
We're out of business.
Maybe this will put you back in business.
Our money. How did you
- You'll find it all there.
I don't know how to thank you. I can tell you how, by selling me an interest in your company.
You mean you want to be partners with us? I reckon.
Mister, you've made a deal.
The Wallace-Armin Freighting Company.
Sheriff! Sheriff!
Jackson, I'm not going to tell you again. Stop that noise.
I ain't started makin' noise yet.
When I do, everyone will hear me, including the United States Marshal.
You can tell Armin and tell him this-
I ain't aimin' to go to no gallows alone.
Walking from here to Chicago and back doesn't do my carpet any good. Besides, it doesn't solve anything.
What am I gonna do about thatJackson?
How am I gonna keep him quiet?
So you got a prisoner who threatens to make trouble. I think we can handle that situation.
What about them lamps burning all night in the Wallace office, their stockade bustin' with mules and new equipment?
I tell you there's somethin' goin' on over there. Oh, I know all that.
What I want to know is, what do they got in the fire?
What their contacts are? What their bids are? I want a report from the inside.
How you gonna get it?
The party who's gonna attend to that is on the way here now- so stop worrying... and get off my desk!
¶ Gonna run all night ¶
¶ Gonna run all day ¶
¶ Bet my money on a bob-tailed nag ¶
¶ Somebody bet on the bay ¶¶
Hey, wait a minute!
What are you tryin' to do, scald me tender enough to pick my pin feathers?
Listen, you, you're having supper with nice folks... and you don't to want to smell like a mule, do you?
Well, I ain't aimin' to stay after vittles anyhow.
I gotta meet Pearl when she closes her Tonsorial Parlor. Yeah.
What are you lookin' at me like that for?
Juke, there's a sheriff looking for you somewhere. Where? Where?
Ah, what'd you say that for?
Nobody'd hide behind that foliage you're wearin' unless he was playing hooky from somebody's jail.
Now ain't that a nice thing to say.
Here I agree to work with you fellas, take you into my home and-
Say, how do I know how many sheriffs is chasin' you around the country?
I'm gettin' that look again.
What does it mean this time?
This time it means
I'm gonna cut your hair.
No, sir! You ain't gonna do no such a durn thing now!
Stay away from me with them sheep shears. Go on now.
Hey, who's this awful-looking character? Huh?
Character? Why, doggone it, that's me without my whiskers. Yeah.
Cole, this is gonna be a secret just twixt you and me, huh?
You fellas ought to be ashamed of yourselves.
That costs plenty of money. Oh, I don't know what you fellas are worrying about.
You got wagons, mules, men, money enough for wages and feed till you get goin'.
I guess that ought to show John Armin you mean business, eh, Cole? I reckon you're right,Juke.
But I'm just realizing how much I gotta learn about this ore-freighting business.
Ted, where is that Half-High mine you're talking about?
It's a lot easier to show you on the map. Come on.
That'll give you a better idea.
Uh-huh.
Now this is the road to the mine. Yeah.
It's the only way up.
That looks like a tough place to get to.
Oh, gettin' up ain't the problem.
It's gettin' down with 10-mule wagons.
Yep. Well, that's the only way you can make it pay,
Those big wagons with trailers on that steep and narrow road? Sure looks dangerous.
Oh, of course it's dangerous, but if Armin can do it, you can. Armin?
He's got Huggins, the owner, by the throat.
Nobody else in town would touch the haul.
So he gets his own price. Can't we underbid him and make it pay?
Enough to keep us goin', that's about all.
But if we can save money for Huggins, other owners will line up on our side.
Why, it seems like to me we ought to pay Mr. Huggins a visit.
Listen, you men, you come and eat this supper right now or I'll feed it to the mules.
Yeah, go on. Get over there.
Go on, go on. You too. You too.
You fellas ought to be ashamed of yourselves.
Here Miss Celia's been slavin' over a hot stove all day... mixin' fancy vittles for you galoots.
Ah, quiet,Juke.
You talk too much.
That's his association with Damon and Pythias.
Hey, wait a minute. If that road isn't wide enough for two wagons to pass, what do you do when you meet one coming down? You don't pass anybody.
You see, there's a flag on top that's raised as a warning if somebody's comin' down.
We do the same thing at the bottom if we're goin' up.
Eat your supper, boys!
Evenin', Sheriff.
Wait a minute, Harvey.
Leave it here. I'll take it in to him. Suits me.
ThatJackson don't look none too tame to me anyway. He needs a lot of watchin'.
Yeah. Good night, Sheriff.
Good night.
Here's your supper,Jackson.
Now listen, when I leave,
I'm gonna forget to lock you in.
That door's open.
There's a horse waitin' for you.
You get aboard and out of Albuquerque, fast.
Well, you must of got my message to Armin.
When I come back in five minutes, I don't wanna find anybody here, understand?
What's the matter, Sheriff?
What happened?
You can see, can't you? This fella
Jackson broke out of jail and I shot him.
I reckon trouble's over for him, but it might just be startin' for some folks.
What do you mean by that?
Nothing. Only sometimes dead men leave ghosts behind 'em.
That's an awfully good supper,
Miss Celia. I'm glad you enjoyed it.
Uh-oh. I'm warning you now. You can't hold me responsible for any casualties.
This is my first experience in an apron.
Uh-uh!
Huh? Oh.
You're doing fine.
Uh-oh.
I think I spoke too soon.
Well, at least this is one less dish to dry. I'm sorry.
It was Ted's fault.
He said you could do anything.
Hmm. You know, that, uh, brother of yours is all right.
He's all the family I have left.
When Ted came out West and got started in this business,
I sold the home back East and joined him.
I reckon he found the goin' pretty tough.
He found your uncle running the whole town.
Riding herd on the little fella, huh? Yes.
I hope you won't be sorry you joined us against him.
There's a fella in jail I'm figurin' on takin' the jingle out of my uncle's spurs.
I'm sticking to my deal, Celia.
I thought you'd feel like that, Cole.
Cole? Cole?
Where is everybody here?
The sheriff just shotJackson makin' a getaway on a horse. What?
Yeah. I'm afraid your uncle's spurs are still jingling.
Now I agree with Ted here.
We have the equipment and drivers and can guarantee the delivery of paying loads to the mill... at a price attractive to you and profitable to us.
Experience is more important than equipment, Mr. Armin.
When a wagon train leaves our mine, we've got to know it'll get to the mill.
I can answer for that.
I drove the haul for Walton.
I know every foot and every hazard.
And now we've gotJuke with us. Yes, sir.
Ted'll be on the lead wagon. I'll be right behind him with Damon and Pythias.
Why, I could make that run with a piano on the back of every mule, pail of water in each hand and another on my head.
Mr. Clark, what about a deal?
Well, now wait a minute. Mr. Huggins, our manager, feels you're new here.
He wants me to show you what you're headin' into. Come here.
I saw it.
I rode up here, you know.
What's that mine up there?
Angel's Roost.
Angel's Roost, huh? But I wouldn't get too ambitious, Mr. Armin.
It's the richest strike in New Mexico, but the road up there is just plain murder.
Who's got that contract?
Nobody. They're afraid to try it.
Why'd you work the property if you couldn't get the ore down?
Well, Huggins had a deal with John Armin.
He agreed if we sunk a shaft he'd get the ore to the mill. What happened?
Well, we like to broke our company digging in up there.
And when we were ready to go,
Armin welshed.
Tried to hold us up on the hauling price.
I reckon he figured on breaking us then takin'it over himself.
Howdy, lady.
Welcome to Albuquerque.
Thank you.
Could you tell me whereJohn Armin's office is?
Straight down the street. Monarch
Building. You can't miss it.
Bed 'em down,Juke. I'll put the contracts in the safe. I'll tell Celia the good news.
Tell her to put the coffee pot on.
Right.
Put 'em up.
Get over here and open up this safe. There's no money in it.
Open it up!
Well!
Cole! Cole!
What happened? Where was that shot? The office.
What's the shooting, Ted?
A hold-up man jumped me when this young lady came in and started blazing away.
Where's the body?
Just went through that door.
We can't have no bodies runnin' around loose in Albuquerque.
I'm afraid I'm not a very good shot. Good or bad, it was timely.
You always carry a gun, lady?
It came in handy tonight.
Just happen to be passing by?
Yes. I only arrived in Albuquerque today.
I'm looking for work. I'm Letty Tyler.
Work? What kind of work?
Oh, bookkeeping, correspondence, payroll.
I think I could make myself generally useful.
We'll need some help, Cole. Now that we've got the Huggins's contract, we expect to get others.
We're certainly grateful to you, Miss Tyler, though I'm afraid we couldn't pay you much at first.
Well, I'm sure I could make out on whatever you could afford.
Well, what do you say, boys? It's all right with me. What do you say, Cole?
I'm just a junior partner.
Whatever the seniors decide.
Then you can start in the morning.
We'll be busy with the Half-High haul.
So, Celia, you can sort of acquaint her with things until we get back.
Fine. I was about to make some coffee.
Won't you join us? Thank you. I'd love to.
Lock up the Huggins's contract, will you, Cole? It's on the safe.
I had him opening the safe when the gal walked in.
Your idea worked out just like you said, Mr. Armin.
Well, I got the job.
Did you find out anything?
Yes. They're nice people.
I wasn't asking about their social qualities. What are they up to?
They've got a contract. The first haul comes off in the morning- the Half-High mine.
I want to congratulate the both of you on a job well done.
Sit down, Miss Tyler.
I can see now that our association is going to be quite profitable to both of us.
Looks all right,Juke.
There's no flag showing on top.
Well, that gives us the right-of-way.
What are we waitin' for?
Let's get goin'.
What are you doin' on this road, Murkil?
Hi, Wallace.
Funny place to meet up, ain't it?
You didn't raise no flag on the top. That gives us the right-of-way. Flag or no flag,
the right-of-way belongs to anybody that can take it. Put down that gun.
And the other one too.
I guess you had things figured about right, Cole.
Figured?
You didn't think your boss was the only
Armin in town that could figure, did you?
Both of you get down and unhitch those horses.
The bookkeeper's job doesn't include janitor work, Letty.
Oh, I'm just sort of clearing the decks for action.
Ted won't know the place all cleaned up.
You think they'll get that ore down safely today?
Ted and Juke are the best drivers in the territory. They'll bring it down.
Oh, I'm sure they will. I haven't seen Cole Armin today. He go along?
Oh, no. He doesn't drive.
He had some other business.
Probably lining up some new contracts, huh? Probably.
He's awfully nice, isn't he?
Seems to be.
Handsome too.
They made it, Letty!
They made it!
Hey, Murkil, helpin' Wallace bring the ore in?
That's the funniest thing I ever did see.
Did you have a nice trip, Murkil?
They oughta build a monument to you!
This town is sure proud of you,
I'll say that!
What's that for? They call this a wishing well, don't they?
Well, I'm buying a wish for a dollar.
And if I ask your wish and you tell it, then it won't come true.
That's part of the legend, too, isn't it? Reckon.
Mind if I ask you something else?
Not if you keep looking at that dollar.
Think you're gonna like Albuquerque?
Reckon.
I'm glad.
I'm glad for a lot of things that have happened to me lately. Before Albuquerque?
Keep looking at that dollar.
You know, Celia, sometimes a single face or person will change the whole way of a man's living and- and he starts wishing for things that never occurred to him before.
If your wishes and wants are real enough, they'll come in search of you.
I wish I could believe that.
Sometimes a man has to ask for what he wants.
Tell me about Texas.
Well, there's an awful lot of it and lonely sometimes.
Funny part is,
I never knew how lonely.
Keep watching that dollar.
When did you find out it was lonely?
In El Paso, when you stepped into that stagecoach.
And I found out something else too- that I needed someone to share this business of living.
Oh, why don't you ask me, Cole?
You're pretty good with that whip.
A real expert could wrap it around a man's throat at 20 feet, strangle him to death.
That could be a dangerous weapon. That's right.
I can certainly think of more pleasant things to talk about. Thank you.
Like what?
Tell me, Ted, how did Cole know... that Armin's men were going to stop you yesterday on the Half-High ride?
Oh, he didn't know. You see, Cole used to ride with the Texas Rangers.
They had a rule: whenever they expected trouble, they'd send a scout ahead before they'd expose their whole troop.
He borrowed that idea from them.
Pretty smart thinking.
Oh, he's a smart fella.
We're sure lucky we got him.
We got big plans for spreading out.
Uh, spreading out?
Well, you're practically one of the firm-
I guess there's no harm in telling you.
But if I have my way, we're going after the Angel's Roost contract.
Your way?
Well, Cole's afraid- that is, he's afraid for the animals, men and equipment.
But I'll be driving that lead wagon, and I know I can bring 'em through.
I'll be pulling for you, Ted.
Then how can I lose?
Buenos dias, amigo.
Buenos dias.
Juke, what in the world are you dressed like that for?
Aw, it's an idea of Pearl's.
She said she wouldn't go to the shindig at the mission... unless I got all rigged up like this.
I'm supposed to be a " trooby-door. "
Troubadour.
Yeah, trooby-door.
Somebody blew it up- the Half-High mine!
The Half-High mine- somebody blew it up!
Tell Pearl I couldn't wait.
Hyah! Get outta the way!
Get outta the way, folks!
Hyah! Get outta the way!
Giddyap!
Move it! Hyah!
Cole! Ted!
Welcome to the family.
That's the best news I've heard in years. Thanks.
I hope you'll be awfully happy.
Thanks. I'm sure we will be.
Cole!
Cole! Ted!
The Half-High's been blowed up!
What?
Half-High?
Mm.
What's next, Cole?
Angel's Roost.
Young fella, what you propose is impossible.
But, Mr. Huggins, your loss of the Half-High mine might put us out of business too.
That's why we're forced to tackle Angel's Roost.
Twenty ton of ore slipping and sliding in that shale on a narrow road... with only a prayer between you and a drop of 5,000 feet?
No, you'd never make it.
It's a road, isn't it?
Not one that'll hold a 20-ton load in that shale with 12 mules.
Walton tried it and lost wagons, mules and men. We still wanna try it.
Have you got that kind of equipment and drivers?
Give us a week. We'll have
'em. You can count on it.
Just a minute. It'll have to be
10 wagons. Nothing less will pay.
Ten wagons?
Yup. If you come through, there'll be a contract waiting for you at the mill.
But I still think you're crazy to try it.
Mr. Huggins, your people have extensive holdings all over this territory.
Now, if we make good on this haul, we'll expect you to give us a chance at the rest of your business.
Just have that mill ready a week from today.
It'll be ready.
Here's a warning.
Just between us, we're not satisfied that Half-High explosion was an accident.
Neither are we.
Come on, Ted.
Good luck, boys. Thank you. See you at the mine.
Yeah.
Hope we didn't bite off more than we can chew. Aw, we got plenty of time.
Is it bad, Ted?
It's my leg.
Let me through here.
What's going on? Who shot him?
The man who shot him is dead.
And you can tellJohn Armin that anyone else he sends after us can expect the same treatment.
What's John Armin gotta do with it?
You oughta know that better than any man in Albuquerque. You're working for him.
That's pretty wild talk.
That's not talk. It's a warning.
The next move
Armin makes against us, we'll wipe him out if it means killing every one of this thugs and burning his place to the ground.
Warren, help me to get him home.
I don't want any more protests from you, Miss Tyler.
Any consequences that follow your job,
I'll back you up.
But, in case you get any righteous ideas,
you're a criminal accessory to anything that happens.
Don't forget that.
Any scruples I might have had went on the bargain counter when I took this job, but you can count me out of any more murder plans.
I give the orders here.
I make the conditions.
You've got your instructions.
Carry them out.
I'm still working for you.
So, my nephew threatens to burn me out of business.
Hmm. Yes.
Is he gonna be all right,
Doctor?
You needn't expect him to be on his feet for a couple of months yet.
That bullet split the femur right through.
Mm. Split the what?
The femur- the thigh bone.
Right now, he's sufferin' from shock.
Needs rest, plenty of it.
That means no talking.
I'll look in again in the morning.
I guess that finishes us for the Angel's Roost contract.
Now, why does it? Huh. To listen to him talk, you'd think he's the only driver in New Mexico.
Yeah.
Look, Ted.
You can run the business right from here.
Juke can get all the drivers and we'll still make that run on schedule.
Make it ahead of schedule.
Juke,you stay here and help Celia.
Where you going?
I've got some private business to attend to.
Won't you come in?
Well, what can I do for you?
I just picked these up atJohn Armin's place.
Was I supposed to find them or are you getting careless?
That's one you'll have to figure out for yourself.
What's that for?
I was just figuring.
You must've needed the job bad to fire blank cartridges at a hired bandit in a fake holdup.
I needed a job bad. I didn't say a job. I said that particular job.
You have it all worked out, haven't you?
It wasn't hard to work out, Letty. Finding your gloves tied the whole thing together.
Very clever.
Wait a minute.
Was that bullet in Ted's leg part of your deal with Armin?
I had nothing to do with that. You mean you didn't actually fire the shot.
IfTed knew you were behind the shooting,
I reckon it would hurt him more than the bullet did.
What- What do you mean by that?
He's in love with you, Letty.
Cole Armin,
I arrest you for arson.
Arrest me?
Wait a minute. What is this?
Who made that complaint?
John Armin.
You had it all ready, didn't you?
The whole town heard you threatening to burn him out.
Come on.
Morning, Fred.
Sit down, Dave.
Hello, Mr. Cole!
Stand up, Cole Armin.
Now, Cole, you've testified that you were not in the vicinity of the fire, yet you refuse to tell us where you were.
Now,you realize, of course, if you have an alibi...
supported by a reputable citizen...
it'll have a distinct bearing on your case.
I have have nothing to add to my testimony, Your Honor.
Tell him where you was, Cole!
Go ahead! Tell him!
You keep quiet,Juke!
One more remark outta you, and I'll hold you in contempt of court.
But he's being stubborner than a jug-headed mule.
Sit down,Juke.
Tell him, Daddy.
Go ahead and tell him!
Uh, wait a minute, Fred.
Myrtle here told me something
I think you oughta know.
Well, if it concerns this case, why, bring her on up here, Dave.
Come on, honey.
Order. Order.
Go ahead, Myrtle.
Tell him just what you told me.
Now, go ahead and talk, honey.
Well, Mr. Your Honor, when my daddy ran to the fire last night,
I was scared to be alone, so I went to the window to look at the fire... and saw Mr. Cole running out of the house across the street.
And, uh
- Now, Myrtle, do you know who lives across the street?
Her-
I mean, Miss Letty.
Are you sure that that was the man you saw?
I'm pretty sure.
It was dark, but he was tall like him.
Yes, I'm pretty sure.
Well, that's, uh, a little irregular.
Now, honey, you have to be positive.
Your Honor, the defendant is my nephew.
And think we all feel he should be given every chance to clear himself.
Very possible
I have been mistaken.
If such is the case, now is the time to correct it.
Why not call Miss Tyler to the stand?
If she substantiates this testimony,
I'll gladly withdraw my complaint.
Miss Tyler, will you take the stand?
I can say if from here,Judge.
Cole Armin... was in my house with me last night.
Case dismissed.
John Armin, you've used my courtroom to air a private family squabble- for what reason,
I don't know and I don't care.
But I'm going to see that it doesn't happen again.
Cole Armin, from today's testimony of your wild threats,
I'm compelled to curb your evident appetite for trouble.
Now, to protect you gentlemen from each other,
I hereby order a peace bond executed over each of you... in the amount of $5,000.
Sheriff, carry out that order.
Court adjourned!
Celia. I- I reckon
I owe you an explanation.
I'm not interested in details, Cole.
You owe me nothing.
All right, Armin. You're in my custody until the bail bond's furnished.
It was right neighborly of you to come see me, honey, but, uh, you better run along home now.
Ajail's no place for a lady.
It is too, if that lady's best friend is locked up inside.
But I gotta stay here until they let me out.
Oh, no, you don't.
Here you are.
I got Clara all saddled and waiting.
She's watered and fed and can travel four days without sleep.
Now, get to work. I'll keep watch while you saw.
But that would be against the law and we've gotta respect the law.
All right. I'm gonna stand here until they let you out... if I have to stand till I'm a little old lady in a shawl.
I'll be a-sittin' here a- knittin' and a-waitin'.
Hello, Mr. Juke.
Hello.
Oh, there you are.
You come down here, young lady.
I want to have a talk with you. Don't you know your pappy's lookin' for you?
You better skedaddle home.
No, sir.
Not until Mr. Cole gets out.
Well, he's getting out.
I got the papers from the judge.
The sheriff's going in to turn him loose.
You'd better go in and keep an eye on him,
Mr. Juke. I don't trust that old sheriff.
Aw, don't you worry none about him, honey. I'll take care of him.
Run along now,
Heh heh heh.
Good-bye, Mr. Cole!
Come on, Clara. Reckon Mr. Cole won't be needin' us now.
Come on.
Juke just bailed you out.
I'm warning you, better keep a checkrein on that temper of yours.
Never mind the blabber. Give him his gun and we'll get out of here.
Where'd that bond money come from?
It was sort of a community affair.
Huh? Ted, Celia, Dave, Pearl
- we all had a hand in it.
We? Yeah. Borrowed some money on my mules.
Not Damon and Pythias? Well, we had to get you out of jail, didn't we?
Well, I sure wanna thank all of you.
Good way to prove that is to get outta town.
Otherwise your friends will lose $5,000.
'Course, it isn't your money.
Never mind.
Come on.
Well, I guess we won the first round, Cole.
You know,Juke, it don't take a smart man... to figure that my uncle's getting a bear trap ready for me.
All you gotta do is stay awake, son.
A man's only got so many fights to win, so many dreams to dream, so much loving and hating to do, and usually old age catches up with him... before he can correct any mistakes he's made.
What are you gettin' that? My biggest mistake, old-timer, was ever leaving Texas.
Aw, you can't say that, Cole, now.
Eating time for the patient.
Is that all I get? Food and medicine are measured out in doses for invalids.
Yes, but I wasn't shot in the stomach.
If you'd taken one step farther down, you would have been. You were lucky.
You know, bullets aren't the only thing that can tear you apart.
Disappointment in people can smash you too.
You're in love with Letty, aren't you?
I was. I guess we both picked the wrong person.
We have realities to face, Ted.
Good news, folks.
Well, I finally got all the drivers.
I had to pay 'em double when they heared it was Angel's Roost, but I got 'em.
We start the big climb at sunrise.
What about Cole?
Did you get him out of jail?
He's out, all right.
Out of town, probably.
Out of town?
Yeah.
He said it'd be better for all hands if he lit out.
Made a lot of mistakes here, he said.
Goin' back to Texas,
I reckon.
Somethin's gotta be done about this.
Oh, Myrtle.
Myrtle.
So the big Texas hero is crawlin' outta town.
I don't aim to fall into any ofJohn Armin's traps.
I reckon Celia Wallace would like to see you turnin' tail.
But don't you worry. I'll be callin' on her after you're gone.
Get up and fight.
Oh, man. If that's the way they fight in Texas, I'm staying in Albuquerque.
As I was saying, Miss Tyler,
you were brought here for a special purpose...
and you failed completely.
I don't think there's anything more to say to you... except that here's your ticket on the next stage.
The sheriff will see you to the depot.
I can find the way. I want to make sure that you get there safely.
I don't need any protection.
You'll need a lot of it if you're in this town after that stage leaves.
Come on, sister. I'll bet this isn't the first time you were escorted out of town.
Take you hands off me!
He busted his peace bond. From the looks of you, that isn't all he busted.
Hold the jokes, Linton.
Go on, Murkil.
Well, you-you told me to pick a fight with him. I did.
All right, Sheriff.
It's your move.
I'll seeJudge Martin and get a warrant for him for attempted murder.
That'll hold him in jail without bail just as long as I wanna keep him there.
Until you get tired of feeding him, then leave the jail door open and shoot him off his horse getting away.
I changed my mind, gentlemen.
I'm not leaving Albuquerque.
I'd advise you to change your mind back again.
No, you're going to change yours.
If you arrest Cole Armin and declare his peace bond forfeited,
I'll let out a yell that'll be heard in Washington.
And I have plenty to yell about, including my own part in it.
You're fixin' for a spell in jail, aren't you, lady?
I'll have company.
Murkil!
You ain't gonna let her get away with that, are you?
Yeah. You're the boss.
What are you gonna do?
Life in jail... if we can't stop her.
You got more than her to stop.
That Wallace outfit's gonna try the Angel's Roost run tomorrow... and they got the toughest hombres in New Mexico driving.
They ain't gonna stop at nothin'.
So they're gonna try for the high one, huh?
It's suicide. He might make it. He's an Armin.
Yes. He might.
Get word to Matt Wayne.
But there ain't no sense in you leaving, Cole.
The Wallaces need you, and they're mighty fine folks.
That's why I'm leaving.
Yes, but you don't have to.
I'll have more witnesses than you can get into Fred Martin's courtroom... that you was nettled into that fight.
Now, wait a minute, Dave.
It isn't that fight.
I'd still be under bond, and next time...
I'd kill Murkil and maybe Armin.
Hey, mister! We're shoving off for El Paso. You coming with us?
Good-bye, old-timer.
Good-bye, Mr. Cole. I feel awful.
Cole! Cole Armin!
So long, Dave.
Cole! Wait up there! Wait!
Hold that coach, driver! Cole!
Cole, I mean, you ain't going no place. What's all this?
Ask Letty.
Don't ask me how or why, but there'll be no further actions by the sheriff on that peace bond.
What's that?
You heared her.
Look, fella. I'm pulling out.
You leaving?
No, he ain't! Git a gettin'.
Come on, son.
Hyah! Hep! Hep!
Hey! Giddyap!
Good luck, Cole.
I'm bettin' on you.
I hope you win, Dave.
I gotta. I'm gonna send Myrtle to college with those winnings.
All right, folks, here's some easy money!
Murkil's laying 10-to-1 that
Wallace's outfit don't make the run!
I'll bet $ 10 they do make it! It's a bet.
Here you are.
I'll take 100 of that.
All right. I'll bet you 2-to-1 they don't even get up there.
I'll take that too.
All right. Alice.
Put me in for 20.
I'll bet you 20 they don't get down. 10-to-1 they don't.
I'd give a $ 1,000 to be on that lead wagon.
Juke will bring 'em through.
Why didn't you go down to the gate and wish 'em luck?
Somehow it didn't mean as much as I thought it would.
Well, after all, you know, Cole wouldn't have been much help.
He can't drive. It was his being here that made the difference.
I'd feel better if he was with them.
Yes. I know, Sis.
Strange, isn't it, how one person can become so important in your life... that without them nothing seems to matter.
It is strange.
We oughta be ashamed.
Thinking of ourselves when men and animals are risking their lives for us.
It's gonna take a lot of courage and luck to bring those wagons down.
All we can do is wait and hope for the best.
Maybe a little prayer from this end will help them... and us.
Stop running! Hup!
When is the next stage for Santa Fe?
If it's on time, it's due here in two hours and 15 minutes.
Well, that means more trouble.
Trouble?
It's Matt Wayne and his men. It's no secret here in town that they'reJohn Armin's gunmen.
Hold 'em here, Andy.
I'll see what the old man wants.
What do you want here?
I wanna see Ted.
Matt Wayne and his men just rode up to Armin's place.
Right now they're probably getting instructions to smash your outfit and Cole Armin too.
Cole Armin's on his way to Texas. He started for Texas, butJuke and I stopped him.
He's up there now helping to bring your wagons down from the Angel's Roost.
- Do you expect us to believe that?
- You will when you hear the rest.
You were wrong about Cole, Celia. He guessed that
I was working for his uncle, and he was right.
John Armin brought you to Albuquerque to get information about our plans?
Yes. Cole suspected me and that's why he came to my house the night of the fire.
Oh, you don't know what it means to hear that, Letty.
Where are you going, Sis?
It's time somebody in this family starting thinking about Cole.
You must've had a pretty good reason for changing over to our side, Letty.
I did.
I'll tell you when I have more time.
Now, boys, we're in for a tough job.
Y'all know what's ahead of you.
Remember what I told you.
If the shale starts slippin' or you get in any trouble, cut the animals loose and jump- let the wagons go over.
You understand?
Sure,Juke. We understand.
All right. Get up on your wagons.
I'll give the order to start.
All right, boys.
Come on. Let's get going.
I wanna wish both you boys a lot of luck. We'll need it.
Here we go, Cole.
Albuquerque or bust.
Good luck,Juke. I hope you make it. Make it?
Shucks, I can make that ride standing on my head.
Juke, one of your riders has run out.
Huh? Which one?
Jim Rough. Tearin' out for town on a horse. Must've had one here waitin' for him.
Doggone it. I was scared of that feller, but he's all there was left.
Armin hired every driver in town.
Armin probably hired him too.
Too bad.
I guess that hangs you up.
The agreement with Huggins was 10 wagons or no deal.
Tell Huggins it'll be 10 wagons.
H- Hey! Wait a minute, Cole.
Wait a minute!
Who's gonna drive Rough's wagon? I'm gonna try it.
Listen, this ain't no Wells Fargo four-up stagecoach on a flat Texas prairie. This is-
This is a 12-mule hitch on a bad mountain road. I know, I know.
I'm scared to let you try it. Listen, to tell you the truth, I'm twice as scared as you are.
But standing here arguing isn't getting that ore down to the mill.
Get on your wagon,Juke.
Now, mark this, Wayne.
If they every get down from that run, it means-
Is there any chance they won't make it?
There's a good chance they won't make it.
What do you want with him and his men?
To play safe on the off chance that they might make it.
I want this Wallace outfit destroyed, wiped out permanently... to show Albuquerque that I'm still running it.
You know what to do!
Now, get out, both of you!
¶¶
Hup, Damon.
Hey thar, Pythias.
Whoa. Hey.
Hey!
Ho!
Hey! Hold 'em back there, Cole!
Hold 'em back, Cole!
Hey,Juke!
Hyah! Damon, come on!
Hup! Damon, Pythias!
Come on, boys!
Stop 'em, Cole! Stop 'em!
I can't! Keep going,Juke!
Hyah, boys! Hyah!
Ho!
Hold 'em! Hold 'em, Cole!
Hyah, boys!
Stop 'em, Cole!
Ho!
Ho!
Ho!
Doggone it, Cole!
I told you ya couldn't drive.
What's the matter?
The brake snapped on me.
You mean you come down through all that shale with no brake? Yeah.
Why, the man ain't living that can do it.
I'm not sure I am living.
Mm. I thought we was both goners, us and the mules, when you come barreling down on us there.
Take a look at that.
Why, that weren't broke. It was sawed! That's what I'm talking about.
Come on. We got some business in Albuquerque. No, you don't.
You get up on that lead wagon.
I'm gonna keep my eye on you.
Now you makin' me feel a lot better. Thanks, pappy.
Yeah. Pappy? Hmm.
What's going on, Harvey?
Everybody's leaving town.
Well, can you blame 'em?
Matt Wayne and his men are back.
Better get your kids and head for home.
Maybe you're right.
Remember, no shootin' till the sheriff fires.
What is it, Celia? You look scared. I am, Cole. Terribly.
Is it Ted? Anything happen to him. No.
What's a matter now?
Why'd we stop?
The town's alive with Matt Wayne and his men. They're waiting for you.
It's wholesale murder, Cole, if you take a step farther.
We're obliged to you for the warning, Celia, but I reckon we can handle any trouble that comes along, eh,Juke?
"The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart. "
That's from the good book.
Now, if you folks will excuse me, I'll have the men gird their loins for battle.
I didn't figure you aimed to put yourself out for me anymore.
Well, thanks to Letty
I'm seeing things clearly again.
Uh-huh.
Listen, Cole, bringing the ore in isn't important now.
Your life is... to me.
Thanks, Celia.
You run along home now by the side roads.
And if by chance you should see Preacher Murray, tell him he's gonna have a couple of customers.
I will. Giddyap.
Take care of yourself, Cole! Giddyap!
I got a good reason to now!
Looks like the Armin Empire is going to war.
You're right, Miss Tyler.
Now you'll see what happens to people who oppose me.
The first sound of fire out there, you'll get a bullet in your back.
A gun with blank cartridges doesn't frighten me.
Blank cartridges?
Are you gonna get your men off that street?
I'm not changing my orders.
They get you, old-timer?
Aw,just nicked me.
Hey. Walton got here with the cavalry just in time, didn't he?
Mr. Armin! Mr. Armin!
Wait a minute, Pearl.
What now?
If I'm gonna make the supreme sacrifice,
I'll be dagblasted if I want the whole town watchin'.
Pull down that curtain.
They'll probably head straight south.
Find 'em. Bring 'em back.
- Supposing they won't come?
- Bring 'em!
We'll catch up with you.
From now on this outfit's gonna move.
Get 'em going.
Matt!
Keep your point moving.
The drag's catching up.
Sure.
Red River ahead!
Hey. It's the Red River!
Red River ahead!
Red River ahead!
- Well. Here's your Red.
- It's quite a river.
We sure had a lot smaller herd the last time we crossed.
One bull and a cow.
This looks like as good a place as any.
This'll take us the rest of today.
Why not cross fresh tomorrow?
We'll put 'em across now.
- We've got a tired bunch behind us.
- Tired men don't run away.
We can't keep 'em wore out the rest of the drive!
We can keep 'em wore out until Cherry gets back. Then nobody'll wanna run.
- Mark for us. Leather!
- Sure enough.
Quicksand out in here! Mark this!
More of it in here!
Mark that from the stump to the tree.
From the stump to the tree.
- How is it up there. Matt?
- Firm all the way.
All right. Bring 'em on in.
But keep 'em downstream!
Bring 'em on. Boys.
Matt! Watch for strays.
Right.
Come on. Cattle! Get in. Cattle!
Come on. Cattle!
Come on. Get goin' now.
Yah. Cattle! Go!
Come on. Cattle.
Hey-yah! Get over there!
Get up there! Hey-yah!
Break up that line!
Head downstream!
Keep 'em comin'!
Bedroll's right down there. Tom.
- Have some coffee. Tom.
- Picked up a few...
- Hi. Matt.
- Hi.
We just picked up a few strays downstream.
All told. We've lost 30 to 40 head.
Better than 9.000 head across in less than four hours.
That's awful good. Tom. Boys did all right.
- Yeah.
- Why don't you tell 'em so. Tom?
That's their job.
They're awful tired.
Then we won't have to count noses in the morning.
That leg bothering you?
Yeah. I hooked it on a horn.
It's opened it up a little.
- Let me look.
- No! Wait till morning.
You need sleep. Tom. Need it bad.
Some nights ago we lost three men.
I haven't slept since and we haven't lost any more.
We're not gonna lose any tonight.
Nor from now on.
Why'd we have to cross today? Wouldn't tomorrow have been just as good?
Dunson's orders. Ask him.
We could have waited till morning instead of finishing after dark.
It don't make sense.
We got a long way to go yet.
Ah. He's getting worse every day.
Sometimes I think he's going plumb out of his head.
Why tell me? If you feel that way.
What do you tell me for?
I... I'm sorry. I...
Here.
You know. Matt. Things ain't right. It's him.
He's gotta sleep.
And if he don't. Something'll happen.
Why. All the sleep he's had in the last three nights wouldn't fill... a mouse's ear.
He won't sleep until...
Yeah.
When do you expect Cherry back?
If he comes.
Tomorrow sometime.
Looks like Cherry!
Get down off them horses. I don't favour looking up to the likes of you.
That's better. You should be crawling.
Cherry. I sent you after three of them.
You brought back two.
Bill Kelsey figured he'd fight.
Made a good one of it for a while.
Hm. Laredo. Teeler.
You signed on for the drive.
You signed on to finish it.
- That's right. We did.
- You stole flour and cartridges.
Besides being deserters.
You're common thieves.
- The law might see it different...
- I'm the law! You're a thief!
You too. Teeler. Anything more?
I know what you're gonna do.
But first I wanna say something.
- Go ahead.
- You're crazy.
You been drinking. You ain't been sleeping and you're close to crazy.
- You through?
- No.
You want to get this herd to market.
So do all of us.
There's a good way to Abilene.
But you won't listen.
No. You wanna drive 'em to Missouri with everything against you. I ain't through.
This herd don't belong to you.
It belongs to every poor cattleman in the whole wide state.
I shouldn't have run away. I should have stayed and put a bullet in you!
I signed up.
But you ain't the man I signed up with!
- You finished?
- Yeah.
You can get your Bible and read over us after you shoot us.
I'm gonna hang you.
No.
No. You're not.
- What?
- You're not going to hang them.
Who'll stop me?
I will.
Give me that gun!
Somebody give me...
I'll kill him. Let me go!
He was gonna kill me! Give me a chance!
Teeler!
Turn him loose.
Cherry. Give me that gun.
Here's what you've been crying for.
All right. Use it!
Go on. You got what you wanted.
What are you waiting for?
If you don't want to live.
All you have to do is...
You're a lucky man. Teeler.
That's how close it came.
Matt. We're getting as crazy as he is.
Keep it. You want to finish the drive?
- Where we going?
- Abilene.
- Who's heading it?
- I am.
What about Dunson?
He stays here.
We're taking the herd.
- That's good enough for me.
- I'm with you. Matt.
I'll go along.
Groot? How about you?
You was wrong. Mr Dunson.
I been with you a lot of years.
And up till now. Right or wrong.
I always done like you said.
Got to be kind of a habit. I guess.
Cos that's why I'm staying with you.
Go on with 'em.
Thanks. Thanks for making it easy on me.
- All right. Men. I'll be coming with you.
- Throw 'em on the trail. Start driving!
Buster!
You wait here till I get back.
You come looking for me. Mr Dunson.
I'll be in Abilene.
All right. Groot. Get going.
If there's a... chance.
We'll get your herd there.
Cherry was right. You're soft.
You should have let him kill me cos I'm gonna kill you.
I'll catch up with you.
I don't know when. But I'll catch up.
Every time you turn around.
Expect to see me.
Cos one time you'll turn around and I'll be there.
I'm gonna kill you. Matt.
- It's only me.
- Oh. I thought... I was scared it was...
- Yeah. Got some coffee?
- Yeah.
I'm an idiot.
Been jumping at every sound I hear.
He wouldn't be coming back yet.
Would he?
I don't know.
You know. Matt? I been figuring.
He'd be a fool to come alone and then again he might.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Most likely he'll ride back and get men and cartridges.
- You took all of his before we left...
- Uh-huh.
Let me see now...
Nearest place is San Felipe.
With that bad leg he'll have to take it easy.
Take him at least four days.
He'll pick up men and start after us.
That's four more. That's eight days.
Then. At our rate.
It's eight days to the river.
Nearer ten. I been figuring some myself.
Four more... eight.
16 and eight. That's 22 days altogether.
And we been gone four days.
Four from 22 is. Uh...
That's 18 days from now.
He couldn't get back quicker than that. Could he?
If that's the way he does it.
That's figuring pretty fine.
Men are figuring pretty fine. Too.
Snarling and snapping and jumping at their own shadows.
What do you think'll happen when he does come back. Matt?
Yeah. I been wondering. Too.
The way he looked when we left him.
It all happened so fast.
I hadn't... I hadn't started out...
We couldn't let him hang
Teeler and Laredo.
You sure he'd have done it?
I don't know.
He was wrong.
Hope I'm right.
Hope there's a railroad in Abilene.
Hey. Matt. Come here!
Matt. look at this.
- About a day ago.
- Not over a day as I make it.
Whoa!
Kwo?
Comanche.
- You sure?
- Comanche arrow.
That's trouble.
Tracks lead north.
Well. Do we go on?
Which would you rather have?
What's behind... or what might be ahead?
- Cherry.
- Yeah?
You and Buster.
Go on ahead about ten. 12 miles.
Enough to give warning.
Get Groot to give you food.
Take your rifles.
Teeler. See the rest of the men have theirs.
Buster.
You oughta get yourself some sleep. Matt.
Yeah. I'd like to.
When do you expect to hear from
Cherry and Buster?
How much grub did they take?
Only enough for three days.
Gun. Gun. Gun. Gun!
- My gun. Where's my gun?
- Teeler. Teeler. Wake up!
You were having a nightmare.
You all right?
I was dreaming.
I thought he was following us.
Forget it. Try and get back to sleep.
How can a man sleep with Indians out ahead and him behind us?
He won't reach us for two weeks.
How do you know?
I don't.
We'll start an hour earlier in the morning.
It's funny.
Funny what the night does to a man.
They're all right during the day.
During the day they can see.
It's Buster!
Yah! Women!
Women and coffee. I tell you!
- I seen 'em!
- You foolin' us?
No. I ain't. I tell you! I had pie and biscuits and beans and coffee!
And a bottle of whiskey.
- Where was this. Buster?
- About 15. 18 miles north of here.
A whole wagon train of 'em heading for Nevada!
- No fooling?
- Oh. I ain't fooling. I seen 'em.
They belong to the Donegal. He sent back to New Orleans for his whole outfit.
- They got a long bar and dice tables...
- That's for me!
- Dancing girls...
- Me. Too!
Hold it!
Buster. Uh. You say about 15 miles away?
Maybe a little more.
Yeah. About a two-day drive.
Well. Who's going to stay behind and drive the herd?
Nobody.
I don't blame you. We're going together and taking the herd with us.
- That's fair.
- Two days. We'll all have coffee.
Hey. You might tell the rest of the men.
Maybe they'd like to hear.
Buster. Where's Cherry?
Cherry? Oh. Well. He figured there was no need in the two of us coming...
- Yeah.
- One was...
- Was she pretty?
- Aw. Matt.
- Remember that little filly I used to own?
- That's what I figured.
Come on.
I ain't never seen such a bunch of men in all my born days.
Everybody wants to ride point so's he'll get in sooner.
Bet nobody's in the drag!
I...
- What's the matter?
- I thought I heard something.
- Hi. Buster.
- Hi.
- How much further to your coffee?
- Oh. It ain't so far. Any of that water left?
Cherry and me rode over this part at night. I'd say it was nearer than further.
What's he want?
I don't know.
- Let's find out.
- Hey! Giddap a-now!
Giddap! Hey! Giddap!
Hey. Matt. I hear gunfire.
- Where?
- Seems like from over that next ridge.
- Hey. I hear gunfire from up ahead!
- Yeah. I know. Laredo.
- What do they always yell for?
- I don't know.
- I make it a few past a hundred.
- That's my count.
We're gonna need the rest of the men.
- Laredo.
- Yup?
While you get the men.
The four of us will go on in.
What about the cattle? Herd'll go sage-belly. It'll take us days to gather 'em.
Yeah. I know. All for saving a bunch of gamblers and women.
Laredo. When you get the men.
Split 'em up.
Half go in from over there.
Half from behind the knoll.
As you go in. We'll come out from the wagons and meet you. You got that?
Yup.
And don't leave any of them alive.
Or they'll come back and hit the herd.
Well. Buster.
Want some more coffee?
All ready?
Don't shoot until you have to.
- Matt! Over here!
- Spread out!
Yell when you see them coming!
Glad you got here.
They hit us about an hour ago!
- The others coming?
- Yeah. Won't take long. They're coming...
Coming in from both sides of that slope.
We're going out when they get here.
Tell 'em. Will you?
Sure.
Some extra guns and a rifle.
Help yourself.
You're shooting high. Aim lower!
You're standing in a lot of mud.
A water barrel got hit.
- You're still shooting high.
- I probably am. I'm no good!
Stop wasting powder.
Load for me. Keep down!
What are you mad about?
I asked you why you're angry.
Is it because...
...because... some of your men might... might get hurt?
- Killed maybe?
- Why don't you stop talking and load...
That's fine.
- Thought I told you to stay down.
- You did.
- Why didn't you?
- Cos I got up.
Not so bad.
Hold still.
- All right. It's free.
- Here they come. Matt!
You'll have to wait.
Ma'am. Over here.
Watch her.
See she doesn't move till I get back.
Thanks. Leave the cloth. Will you?
Gonna have to cut your dress away.
- That shouldn't bother you.
- It doesn't.
I asked you before why you were so mad.
Is it... is it because your cattle. The cattle
Cherry told me about. Might run off?
Or maybe... maybe you don't like the idea of helping...
- helping a bunch of...
- Bunch of what?
Yeah. That's what I thought you thought.
- This is gonna hurt.
- Yeah. It'll hurt you more than it does me.
- No. This'll hurt you.
- Aaah...
You were right. It did.
Sometimes there's poison.
It's... it's too bad to... to put you to so much trouble. I...
- Here. Hold this.
- You got...
Got blood on your cheek.
- Is it gonna make you faint?
- I hope not.
At least... At least not until I've done something I've been wanting to do.
- Well. I saw the slap.
- Come on. Lift her up.
- What happened?
- She's gonna be all right.
- Where does she belong?
- Over here.
Were any of your men hurt. Cherry?
Not enough to count. We were lucky.
We were... I said we were lucky.
Oh. I'm sorry. Cherry. I was just...
I know. There's no use looking. Melay.
He won't be coming.
I didn't really think he would.
I just... Where is he?
Out with the herd. Watching.
- What's his name. Cherry?
- Matthew Garth.
Matthew Garth.
- Shoulder hurt much?
- A little.
I made a mess of things. Didn't I?
I don't know. I wasn't there.
What happened?
Took one look at me and made up his mind I was one of a bunch of...
One look. That's all he took. Got mad.
- Wasn't any excuse. I just...
- Yeah.
Tell me why he did that. Cherry.
Well. There's a lot to it.
I don't know the whole...
Hey. Groot! Come here.
- This is Miss Melay.
- Howdy. Ma'am.
He's Groot. He knows more about Matt than anyone.
She'd like to know about him.
- Just what did you want to know?
- Anything you can tell me. Groot.
Why?
See. I met Matt today just after he rode in.
We didn't get along very well and... I want to find out why.
See. He thought I was one of the...
Hold it... right there.
It's all right. Buster. It's me. Matt.
I thought it was...
Look at me.
Fog's got me jumpy.
Wish it'd rain.
He wouldn't pick you off in the fog. Buster.
Oh. I... I know it.
Well. I ain't seen a thing till you come by.
I'll be back at midnight.
Get Groot to fix you some food.
We're starting in the morning.
That's the story.
Now you know more about him.
Yeah.
- What would you do if you were me?
- If I was you?
Now. Ain't that just like a woman?
I ain't you. How far would you get with a puss like mine?
I'd like to talk to him. If he'll talk to me.
We won't be here but a few more hours.
Morning at the latest we'll be gone.
I know that. I... I still want to talk to him.
- That's the way you want it. Huh?
- That's the way I want it.
All right. I'll go see where he's at.
Matthew?
Matthew Garth!
Over here.
Groot said I'd find you here. I...
I want to talk to you.
Is... is it all right? I wanted to...
You're shaking.
- You thought I was Dunson.
- Yeah.
- Hey. How did you know...
- I know about it. Groot told me.
It's funny. I didn't imagine you being scared. It doesn't seem to fit.
- It fits.
- I guess it does.
It makes things clear. It helps.
- Helps what?
- I know how you feel. I'm scared. Too.
That's why I'm talking. Because it's the best thing to do when you feel that way.
No. It is. I talk to myself even if
I have to sit in front of a mirror and talk.
- I can see myself...
- You don't have to do that.
You can talk to me.
I'm right here and if it'd help...
Oh. Please. You can tell me to mind my own business.
If it would help any. You can hit me.
Like I did you. Right across the mouth.
But it'd be good for you to talk and I'd like to talk to you...
Please. I'd really like to talk to you.
I'd like it better than talking to a mirror.
I wanna know more about him.
Why does he think that way?
Because he got to a place where... See.
He'd taken empty land used for nothing.
Made it the biggest ranch in the state of Texas. Fought to keep it.
Flat-nosed bull and one cow.
That's all he started with.
- And. Well...
- Well. What?
After he'd gotten what he'd been after for so long. It wasn't worth anything.
Wasn't worth having.
So he started this drive.
Everyone said "You can't make it.
You'll never get there. "
He was the only one who believed we could.
He had to believe.
So he started thinking one way - his way.
He told men what to do and made 'em do it.
Otherwise we wouldn't have got as far as we did.
He started for Missouri and all he knew was we had to get there.
I took his herd away from him.
You love him. Don't you?
He must love you.
That wouldn't be hard.
Did you like that?
I've always been kinda slow in making up my mind.
Maybe I can help.
I don't need any more help.
But will you do that again?
Hm. That was sure good.
Yeah. Anybody can fix good victuals if they have something to cook.
- I'm so hungry I could eat anything.
- Why don't you eat?
Kwo's gathering wood. Sent him out before I thought about eating.
- Hi. Cherry.
- Hi.
It's raining hard. The river's rising.
If it gets worse.
We'll have a bad time crossing.
- Don't want to get stuck on this side.
- Somebody oughta tell Matt. He's...
I'll tell him. Hey. Matt.
Cherry just said it's raining hard...
Yeah. I heard it.
I was figuring that way myself.
We're leaving now. Let's get started.
We're crossing tonight.
Cherry. Take the point.
Buster. Start on the flats.
Get going. Groot.
Anything else?
We can't take her with us. Can we?
Well. We could. Uh...
What?
No. No. I don't suppose we could.
Where you been? Took you long enough!
Now we're moving and I ain't had nothing to eat! Come on. Start packing.
- Be anything else. Ma'am?
- Thank you. Andy. That's all.
Hey. We've got visitors.
- Hiya. Stranger! Where you from?
- Texas.
- What can we do for ya?
- A trail herd came through here.
Right.
- When?
- Over a week ago.
They helped us fight the Indians. Been patching up our wounded before leaving.
- How far ahead are they?
- They're gone eight days now.
Nine tomorrow.
We're about ready to eat. Mister.
You and your men can split around.
We'll feed you.
- Well. Thanks. I...
- I'll take care of Mr Dunson.
You two boys come with me.
How did you know my name?
We can talk about that later.
Sit down.
I believe it's your beef we're eating.
- Who told you that?
- The man you promised to kill.
- Did he tell you that. Too?
- You're tired. Aren't you?
Tired. Hungry. And just a little bit irritable.
You'll feel better after you eat.
We'll talk then.
How'd you get that away from him?
I stole it.
So you stole that bracelet.
- How did you get it?
- Would you really like to know?
- How did you get it?
- I got it in the rain!
Eight days ago.
Before he took your herd across that river and left.
I'm wondering whether to believe you.
- I don't care if you do or not.
- I believe that.
- Wanna hear more?
- Go ahead.
It was raining. If it hadn't rained.
I wouldn't be here talking to you.
He wouldn't be where you could find him to kill him.
- You still intend to kill him?
- Nothing you can say or do...
I didn't say anything.
I'll get you another drink.
So he went off and left you.
I didn't give him that much credit.
- You in love with him?
- I thought you'd ask that.
Can a woman love a man who leaves her?
Well. She... She shouldn't.
I wanted to go with him.
But he had to get your cattle to market.
Said I wasn't strong enough to go.
Nothing I could do or say would make him change his mind.
But I wanted to go with him.
I wanted him so much that...
That you felt... like you had knives sticking in you.
How did you know that?
I suppose other people have felt that way before.
They have.
- Now will you tell me something?
- What?
- Why do you wanna kill him?
- Because he's a thief.
- You think he thinks that?
- He should!
I picked him up in the brush leading a cow. That's 14 years ago.
Taught him all I could.
He knew what I was planning.
Saw what I was building.
He knew that some day it'd all be his.
His land. His cattle. The whole thing.
Even talked of a woman. As men'll talk.
A strong woman who could bear him sons. A woman like you.
Why did you want him to have a son?
Because I'd built something. Built it with my own hands. And I can't live for ever.
Can't live to see it grow.
Thought I had a son.
But I haven't.
- And I want one.
- I'm sorry for you. Mr Dunson. Very sorry.
- Stand up! Stand up and turn around.
- Don't tell me what to do!
I'll...
All right.
Well. Miss...
- I don't even know your name.
- Melay. Tess Melay.
Well. Miss Melay. What would you say if... if I offered you half of everything I own for a son?
- Your son?
- You can have a son? It's all that matters.
By Dunson. Out of Melay.
- Half of everything you've got.
- That's right.
I'll have your son. Mr Dunson.
If you'll stop now.
Stop now and go back where you came from.
Yeah. I thought so. When did you...
- Did you really hurt that arm?
- I hurt it. It's almost well.
You can take that gun out of the sling now.
Wouldn't have done you any good.
- When did you fall in love with him?
- I fell in...
It was... It was under a wagon.
Six inches in mud.
- When did... When did you...
- What?
- When did you fall in love with her?
- Who?
The girl you told me about.
The one you left.
- I told you? Did he tell you...
- No. You told me.
You knew how I felt when he left me.
She must have felt the same way when you left her. That's right. Isn't it?
Or can't you remember?
I can remember.
Oh. I... I hope so because... because I want you to think about her while I ask you something.
- I want you to think hard.
- What?
- I wanna go on with you.
- That won't do any good.
- Nothing you can say or do...
- I know that. But I wanna go with you.
Please.
- All right.
- Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
- Why don't you use it?
- Hm?
Oh. You mean...
Would there be any use going if I did?
We'll start early.
I'll be ready.
I been thinking that Abilene just ain't.
We probably missed it. We'll probably keep going clear to Canada.
We'll be driving the herd up and down icebergs yet.
We'll find it.
If we do. It'll be tough if the railroad ain't there.
- It's gotta be there.
- But if it ain't?
- We'll keep driving till we find it.
- Or until Dunson finds us.
Hey. Hold it a minute.
What was that?
- You hear something?
- No.
I did. It was nothing I ever heard before.
Hey. They're yelling down on the point.
We made it! Whoo-hoo!
- Hi!
- Howdy! Hello. There. Howdy!
- We're looking for Abilene.
- I sure am glad to see you! I sure am!
- Do you go to Abilene?
- You're a sight to behold!
If you'll tell us where Abilene is.
We'll get out your way.
Mister. Let me set here and feast my eyes.
If you knew how much we been waiting for cattle and how welcome you are.
You can sit on them tracks for ever!
- All we want to do is get to Abilene.
- Don't rush me. Mister.
But if you want to get there. You can take the short cut there about 12 miles.
- Or follow the track. It's longer.
- We'll take the short cut.
I'll wait all day here for you to cross!
Take your time!
- Can you blow the whistle once more?
- Sure can!
Just look at that!
They even smell good.
- Well. There she is. Matt.
- Yeah.
There was times I thought we was never gonna make it.
Hey. It looks like they're as glad to see us as we are them.
Howdy-do!
- Welcome to Abilene. Who's in charge?
- I am.
- My name's Melville.
- Garth. Matthew Garth.
We're sure glad to see you. Mr Garth.
And that goes for all of us.
Man. Man. Don't stop 'em.
Keep 'em coming. Keep 'em coming.
Everything's ready for you.
- Engineer told us you were coming.
- Oh. He gave us a fine welcome.
- What's the best way to the stockyard?
- Drive 'em through town.
They're not house-broken!
That's all right.
We been waiting a long time for this.
You just drive them straight down that main street and let the folks see 'em.
- We'd like to ride along with you.
- Sure. Come on. Keep 'em coming!
It's a great sight. Mr Garth.
I don't believe you realise what a great sight it is.
- Cherry. Hold 'em there!
- I'd like to have a business talk with you.
- Can these boys handle things?
- They been doing it for over 1.000 miles.
Oh. Pete!
You stay here. Anything those boys want out there. You give it to 'em.
Buster. Buster.
- Cherry. Watch things. Will you?
- Sure.
Come in. Boys.
What's the matter?
The roof is funny. We haven't been under one in three months.
Sit down. Let's talk a little business.
- Mr Garth. I'm... What is your first name?
- Matthew.
Matt. I'm the Greenwood
Trading Company of Illinois.
- I'd like to buy your beef.
- That's why we came.
How many you got?
I don't know exactly.
We started out with... well over 9.000.
- Man alive!
- We've lost 600 or 700 on the way.
We won't have 'em all in till eight or nine o'clock tonight.
We haven't got enough corrals.
We could leave them in the streets.
They're tired. They should stay put.
That'd be all right. What's your price?
Well. Uh... I'm kinda new at this.
- Would you make me an offer?
- All right. $20.
You... A head?
$20 a head!
Well. Uh...
Oh. How can a man deal with someone who's done what you've done?
I'll give you top price that anyone else offers for a lot of 500 and I'll take the whole herd.
Looks like you're gonna buy yourself a lot of beef.
If that engineer was here.
I'd get him to blow his whistle again!
I'll draw up a contract and have it ready for you tonight.
Buster and I will find out what you're gonna have to pay. Be back in two hours.
You. Uh. Need anything else?
You need some cash?
I sure could use some.
I'd like to pay off the men.
- All right. It'll be ready for you tonight.
- All right. Thanks. Mr Melville.
- So long.
- So long.
They crossed here. All right.
Not over four or five hours ahead.
Here you are. Matt.
You'll have to sign this.
Here's a cheque to
Thomas Dunson for $50.000.
Rest'll be paid when the tally's finished at $21 a head.
I've taken a credit here for the money you wanted to pay off your men.
I suppose...
I suppose they'll be celebrating.
- They've got a right to.
- Of course they have.
There's three times in a man's life when he has a right to yell at the moon.
When he marries.
When his children come.
And... and when he finishes a job he had to be crazy to start.
- When do you expect to be leaving. Matt?
- I don't exactly know.
You're gonna wait for Dunson. Huh?
I've been talking to some of your men.
Isn't that cheque and the fact that you got here going to make any difference?
- I don't think so. Mr Melville.
- I suppose I'm crazy. But...
- You want me to run away?
- No.
Of course not.
Couldn't... couldn't I talk to him?
I'd still have to talk to him after that.
Good night. Mr Melville.
- Get a good night's sleep.
- Yeah. I could use some.
Good night.
- Evening. Mr Melville.
- Evening.
Well...
- Work's not done yet. Huh?
- No. Sir.
Well. You fellas see you get her done.
I like that boy. Too.
I'll buy the drinks when it's over.
He's... he's... he's camped two or three miles outside of town.
He says he'll be here just after sunup.
He says he's going to kill you.
What's the matter? Is something...
Oh. I must look like I'm in mourning.
I didn't mean it that way or I wouldn't have...
No. No. Matthew.
I know you've only a few hours.
But listen for just a minute. Then I won't talk about it any more. Just a minute.
- He hasn't changed his mind. Matthew.
- I didn't think he would.
We saw the railroad. I thought it might make a difference. But it didn't.
He's like something you can't move.
Even I've gotten to believe it's got to happen. Your meeting.
I was gonna ask you to run. But...
No. I'm not. It wouldn't do any good.
You're too much like him.
Oh. Stop me. Matthew. Stop me...
God bless you. Matthew.
- Morning.
- Morning.
Got a match. Walt?
I told you all where you stand in this.
See that you remember it.
Hey!
He's got plenty with him.
- How many?
- Ten or 12.
- I'll be telling Matt.
- Right.
He's coming in now.
Got about ten with him.
You know that young man isn't going to use his gun. Don't you?
Yeah.
But I haven't any such notion.
Mr Dunson.
Mr Dunson. I'll say it just one more time!
Go on. Draw.
I said draw!
Then I'll make you.
You're soft.
Won't anything make a man out of you?
You once told me never to take your gun away from you!
You yellow-bellied. Chicken-livered...
All right. For 14 years I've been scared.
But it's gonna be all right.
Get up. Come on. Get up!
Stop it! Stop it!
Stop making a holy...
Stop it. I said. I'm mad! Good and mad!
And who wouldn't be?
You. Dunson. Pretending you're gonna kill him! It's the last thing you'd... Stay still!
And you. Matthew Garth! Getting your face all beat up and all bloody.
You oughta see how silly you look!
Like... like something the cat dragged... Stay still!
What a fool I've been!
Expecting trouble for days when anybody would know you two love each other!
Took somebody else to shoot you.
He wouldn't! Are you hurt?
- No. Just nicked the fat...
- Then stay still!
No. Don't. I changed my mind.
Go ahead. Beat each other crazy.
Maybe it'll put some sense in you.
Go ahead! Do it!
Use this. No. You can't. It's his.
You'd better marry that girl. Matt.
Yeah. I think I'd...
When are you going to stop telling people what to do?
Right now. At least as soon as...
- When?
- As soon as I tell you one thing more.
What?
When we get back to the ranch. I want you to change the brand. It'll be like this.
Red River D.
And we'll add an M to it.
You don't mind that. Do you?
No.
You've earned it.
Visiontext subtitles: Natasha Cohn
Quiet, folks.
I hereby christen you Windy Miller.
Look out for your eyes.
- AI, where is Windy?
- I haven't seen him since last night.
Anybody here seen him?
- No!
- Look out!
Put it up over the lights.
- Little previous, ain't you, Jim?
- It won't be long, brother.
You did?
- You got anything to say, Bud?
- Sure, I'm guilty, Judge.
I've been away so long from towns and people, I just didn't know what I was doing.
I was with Sherman down in Georgia.
- How long's this fella been in jail?
- Since this morning, Your Honour.
- What time this morning?
- 3:00, I reckon.
I sentence you to 11 and a half hours in jail.
Sentence to set back to 3:00 this morning.
- Now hightail it out of here.
- Thank you, Judge.
What's next?
Dan Thomas... and Tod Ramsey.
You boys get up there.
You're charged with trespassing on private property... of farmer O. V. Martin.
And of stealing a hog, which was recovered at the point of a musket.
Don't you Johnny Rebs know it's against the law to go stealing of?
It wasn't against the law for Sherman down in Georgia.
- What he means...
- I know what he means.
- How do you plead? Guilty or not guilty?
- Not guilty.
- What's that?
- Not guilty.
Why, Constable, you said the farmer caught them red-handed.
He sure did, Your Honour.
We took the pig, Judge... but we're not thieves. We were hungry.
We hadn't eaten for several days... and we got kind of tired of people closing doors on our faces... just because we have the wrong kind of uniform on.
Have you got anything to say before sentence is pronounced?
We only came up to work on the railroad, and we found that finished.
We're on our way to Texas.
Texas? It's a mighty good place for the likes of you two.
You, Lee, and Beauregard, and the rest of that rebel riffraff... can get together down there... and maybe you can start another secession movement.
You dirty Yankee!
Danny, wait a minute.
You can't do that in this court.
What's the matter with you?
Order.
Order in the court.
You young whippersnappers.
I find you both guilty.
I'm gonna fine you $50 apiece.
And as for you,
I'm gonna make an example out of you.
I'm gonna hold you for contempt of court... and fine you another $50.
We haven't got $50, let alone him having $100.
Take them away. Next case.
Bats Delaney.
Take your hands off them.
Here's the fine for both of them.
That's a little bit irregular, Mr. Miller.
Everything's irregular in this two-by-four court.
Including your remark about Lee and Beauregard.
There's $20 for the fine of Bats Delaney.
Come on, Bats.
- He ain't entered his plea.
- He pleads guilty.
That's $20, and the fine's only $10.
Take the change and get some of the stink out of this place.
Come on.
Court's dismissed.
Come on.
- Mr. Miller?
- What do you want?
- We'd just like to thank you.
- Yeah, thanks a lot.
Don't give it a thought.
What outfit you boys with in the war?
Jeb Stuart's cavalry, army of Northern Virginia.
I might've known it.
Nobody but a Virginian or a Texican would jump a judge in his own court.
We'd like to work that money off, if you'd let us.
Ain't often a stranger will do you a favour like that.
I ain't no stranger where a Johnny Reb is concerned.
I'm a Texican myself.
You boys still hungry?
I got the same appetite
I brought to town with me three days ago.
Bats, take them down to Camp 18 and feed them.
And keep your nose out of that jug.
You boys look me up at the fight tonight.
Come on, I gotta get rid of them high-collar dudes from Chicago.
Who is that one-man cyclone?
You mean you ain't never heard of Windy Miller?
No, we never did.
But from now on, we're for him.
Where's that food he was talking about?
Come on.
Oh, don't you remember
sweet Betsy from Pike
Oh, don't you remember
sweet Betsy from Pike
Who crossed o'er the mountain
with her lover lke
With two yoke of oxen,
a big yeller dog
A tall Shanghai rooster,
and one spotted hog
Oh, sing, goodbye Pike County
Farewell for a while
We'll come back again
when we've panned out our pile
They soon reached the desert,
where Betsy give out
While down in the sand
she lay rolling about
Come on, let's have the fighters in here!
Quiet!
Ladies and gentlemen... we beg your indulgence for a few more minutes.
We can't start this fight till Windy Miller gets here.
He's being detained at the hotel on business.
What business?
The railroad's finished, ain't it?
Start that fight.
Get Windy here in a hurry.
- Get your fighters in the ring.
- All right.
Quiet, now.
The fighters will be right in the ring.
Get them out of here.
This is all right.
I think I'm gonna like this town.
Yeah. Plenty going on here, huh?
Introducing the pride of Camp 19.
The best track layer west of the Mississippi:
Dutch Henry!
Hurray!
Boo!
Quiet.
Introducing the pride of Camp 18:
Matt Sawyer!
Boo!
- What's the matter with you?
- My leg, it's busted.
Somebody get a doctor.
Get a doctor, somebody.
A fine time you picked to be a high-jumper.
Get him out of here.
We got to have a fight.
There's Windy now. Come on.
Don't you worry, folks, don't you worry for a minute.
We'll have a fight if I have to take him on myself.
- Come here.
- Hey, big fella. I'll take you on.
- Excuse me. May I get through, please?
- Go on back and sit down.
- I'd like to get through to the ring.
- Go on back and sit down.
- Wait a minute.
- Just a minute.
You want to make something of it?
Hey, you Jeb Stuart boy!
Come over here.
How would you like to pick up $200 in a hurry?
I'd even spend some time to pick up that much money.
Start getting out of your clothes, you're gonna fight Dutch Henry.
No. Wait a minute. I'm no fighter.
Win or lose, $200 in cash.
I'll do it for $50.
What?
We owe you the rest.
You've got a good memory.
- I'll bet it on you.
- Thanks.
- What's your name?
- Dan Thomas.
We'll tell them Texas Thomas. Get ready.
All right, get him ready.
You're crazy to do this.
Henry's a professional fighter.
He'll beat your ears down.
- We got $50 to take us to Texas, haven't we?
- Yeah.
- Hold on to it.
- All right.
I told you folks we were gonna have a fight.
Introducing the champion of the Lone Star State:
Texas Thomas.
Do you think that this is another one of Windy's tricks?
Work him around to this corner.
We'll take care of him.
This is going to be a decision fight, gents... according to the London Prize Fight rules.
There'll be no biting in the clinches.
When a man goes down... that ends the round.
If he can't come to the centre of the ring and toe the mark inside of 30 seconds... he loses.
- Are you ready, Texas?
- Yeah.
- Are you ready, Henry?
- Yep.
Let her rip.
Let me at him. Leave me at him.
What's going on here?
He grabbed Dan's foot.
You do that again and I'll take you apart myself.
Get back there and let's get this fight going.
I'll bet you all thought it was real, didn't you, folks?
Just a little entertainment I put on between the rounds.
What did you let him see you for?
Round two coming up. Time.
Where's Tex? Where did he go?
Anybody see him?
Windy, here he is.
Come on, get up here and fight.
I'm all right, Tod. Don't worry.
Good boy, Tex. Go get him.
Wait a minute, Danny.
Wait a minute, Danny. Come on.
Time!
More water. Some more water.
Round four. Time!
How long is he gonna keep getting up?
Round 10. Time!
Time!
- What round is it?
- Thirty-five.
Round 35. Time!
- I'm getting mighty tired of this.
- I don't blame you.
Are you all right, champ?
- Why don't they start the fight?
- Time!
Danny, are you all right?
Tex, do you want to quit?
- What happens to your bets if I quit?
- I win, of course.
You what?
You didn't really think I'd bet on you, did you?
Round 40. Time!
No, but I'm gonna make you wish you had.
Let him fall!
Let him fall!
Come on, Tod.
- I guess we lost them.
- Yeah.
- You feel all right?
- Yeah.
That $50 makes everything all right.
- Danny.
- Yeah?
- We haven't got that $50.
- What?
- I bet it on Dutch Henry.
- You what?
You sure don't have to be told what state this is.
Too big.
Do you realise we've been riding a week without seeing a single human being?
It's kind of quiet and peaceful, though, after coming through that Indian country.
Right now, I wouldn't even mind seeing an Indian.
You'd think people would hang out a sign.
If we keep on going, we're bound to hit something.
All right, everybody, out of that coach, and keep your hands up.
Looks like you could have picked a shady spot.
Shut up.
Which one of you fellows is the cattle buyer from New Orleans?
Go through them.
I wish you wouldn't take those.
Went all the way to Kansas to get them for Mrs. McLane.
- She needs them bad.
- Are you a dentist?
You don't think them things would fit a horse, do you?
- There's a point.
- Come on.
That's real nice of you, brother.
It must be you.
Give me that $10,000 and quick.
- How did you know I was the cattle buyer?
- Never mind that. Get back in that coach.
- They're good at it, ain't they?
- Yeah.
Let's be moseying.
- You're always doing something like that.
- Is that so?
I was holding up stagecoaches before you got your diapers off.
If I hadn't stopped you, you'd still be arguing with that tooth-yanker.
But a horse could wear false teeth.
I remember one time, when I was way back in...
I know you knew a horse in Tennessee that wore a pair.
Yes, I did.
What did the boss want to meet us here for?
You know as much about that as I do.
Don't know what them Texans fought so hard to get this state for.
- Hardest ground in the world.
- Where's it any different?
In Cheatham County, Tennessee, the ground is so soft... they use it to stuff mattresses with.
What's the matter with him?
All right, on your feet.
Get moving and keep those hands up.
Get over there, you two.
- Who are you?
- Just a couple of strangers passing through.
All right, now, lie down.
- Can't we make some arrangement?
- Not today. Get down there.
You ought to split with us.
That'd be the honest thing to do.
- This ground is hard.
- All right, stampede their horses.
- We'll meet again, someday.
- I hope you're carrying as much money.
I don't think there's a town in the whole state of Texas.
Here we are with all this money and nothing to spend it on.
The way you talk about that money, you'd think it was really yours.
Listen, Tod, what's the sense of...
We can eat, anyway.
Get a fire going, I'll cut one of them out.
And hang on to this.
Right.
- Hello.
- Get them up, son.
- You're the sheriff?
- That's right.
Here's the holdup money.
- Sure it's the holdup money.
- Then you admit it?
- Where's the rest of your gang?
- We...
Wait a minute. I didn't hold up no stage.
You're gonna tell me you waylaid the fellows who did.
- That's just what I did.
- Where's a tree?
- I was gonna return the money.
- I never saw the beat.
Every time I wanna hang a fella, there's no tree.
- There's a big oak a mile back.
- You can't do that without a trial.
As Sheriff and justice of the peace, you are guilty and will be hanged.
- Get on your horse.
- Just wait a minute.
Come on, get on your horse.
They say as how this tree was planted
40 years ago by Davy Crockett.
Why don't you wait and ask the stage driver?
Son, I'm a court of law and evidence is what counts.
You had the money, didn't you?
- Indians!
- Where?
Right behind me. Hundreds of them.
Here, boy. You're on your honour now.
Take for the hills, men.
Come on, boy, come on.
Ain't I the darndest liar? Come on.
Where are they going?
We've been hornswoggled. Get after them.
- We've got to separate.
- Separate?
It's our only chance.
I'll catch up with you some day.
Texas ain't that big.
You ain't much to look at, but I'll sure miss you.
I ain't forgetting you, either.
- Good luck, fella.
- Take care of yourself, Danny.
All right, folks, step down.
What do you think you're doing?
Sorry, lady, but I've got to take one of your horses.
You'll do no such thing.
- I'm telling you to get off.
- I will not.
You get off, or I'll take both horses and the buckboard, too.
Now get off.
Will you help me down?
Stop!
Pull up.
- I can't stop here.
- Get out.
- Lady, there are some men after me.
- Get out.
If they get me, they'll kill me for something I didn't do.
I could kill you for what you've done.
Get out.
The blankety-blank.
I've never seen a person do so many things wrong in such a short time.
What I do is none of your business.
Just leave me alone.
I'm perfectly comfortable.
You're sitting in a lot of ants.
I like ants. Ouch!
Come here.
I can't unhook you if you don't stop wiggling.
Hurry up. Let me go.
You can have your rig back now.
- I'll walk the rest of the way.
- I hope you break a leg.
Thanks for the lift.
- Don't mention it.
- One more thing.
You sure are pretty.
Giddyup!
Slim.
I'm sorry. I thought you were Slim.
Where did you come from?
I was right over there.
No, I mean, do you work around here?
Since when?
- This afternoon.
- Fine.
You've got some dirt right on your face, up right...
If you'd been bounced around on your ear in the back of this thing... as much as I have, the least you'd have is a dirty face.
- How come you did that?
- It's a long story.
Unhitch these horses and give them a good rubdown.
Yes, ma'am.
- Do you belong here?
- Yes, I'm Mike King.
That's a funny name for a girl. How did you happen to get a nickname like that?
It's not a nickname. It's Michael.
Kind of a mean trick to play on your parents, isn't it?
They expect a boy, and get his name all picked out, and then you come along.
Yes, guess it was.
I almost forgot, when you're finished, will you take an extra horse... and go six miles out the Del Rio Pike and pick up Hank?
- Yes, ma'am. Who's Hank? Your sister?
- No, he's the foreman.
- May I help you down, ma'am?
- Thanks.
- I'll see you later.
- Yes.
Listen, you, that food's only free with your drink.
- Do you understand English?
- No savvy.
- You broke?
- Yeah.
Why didn't you say so?
We got a right hospitable little town here.
Never turn away anybody that's hungry or thirsty.
If you're gonna eat free, you might as well drink free.
Come on over and have a drink on the house.
- Thanks.
- Don't give it a thought, brother.
Here you are.
Get out of here.
Hi, boys. Hot, ain't it?
Give me a beer.
Beer.
Never mind about that beer.
Get your hands up.
Indians, huh?
Pretty smart, wasn't you? Who's smart now?
Listen, Sheriff...
No, you don't.
Come on out from behind that bar.
Get out from behind there.
- You're making an awful mistake.
- I ain't making any mistake.
Get his gun, Walt.
Keep him covered.
Ouch!
I told you, you made a mistake.
Son, you'd better be careful now.
- This won't do, you know.
- Come on, turn around.
Get back all of you. Get back.
Move.
- lf you like your sheriff, don't start anything.
- No, boys, don't start nothing.
- What's going on here?
- Out of the way, mister.
Don't argue with him.
It's my back he's got the gun into.
- Get out.
- He don't look dangerous. What'd he do?
Held up the southbound stage.
Move out of that door.
Wait a minute.
You got the wrong man, Sheriff.
If you got him.
- We caught his partner with the money.
- You did?
And there were no
Christmas trees out there either.
That's funny. I was on that stage and he wasn't one of them.
How could you tell? They was all masked.
A mask only hides your face.
It doesn't change your voice or the way your bones is hung together.
And I'll swear he wasn't one of them.
- What about it?
- The Doc's word's good enough for me.
But it's sure kind of queer.
It's this heat.
You can't believe what you see.
Can I have the gun?
Stubborn cuss.
Thanks, mister.
That was kind of a tough spot.
No sense in a man getting hung for something he didn't do.
All this talking has made me kind of thirsty.
Come on.
Give me a bourbon.
- What'll you have?
- A cold glass of beer.
I guess it did look kind of bad to the sheriff finding your partner with that money...
- after the stage was held up.
- I guess it did.
How'd you get it?
Me and my partner held up the bandits.
Then, when I was out running down some beef... the sheriff held up my partner.
So, I held up the sheriff.
Sounds like you was playing some kind of a game.
It does, doesn't it?
Doc, can I come up to see you this afternoon?
- Any time.
- Thanks.
Was you gonna return that money?
That was my partner's idea.
But you was going south with it, huh?
Sure I was, till the sheriff took it away from us.
By George, I like an honest man.
What's your name?
- Dan Thomas. What's yours?
- Thorpe, Buford Thorpe. Call me Doc.
- You live around here?
- Nope.
- Got any relatives around here?
- Nope.
- Where you headed?
- No place.
What kind of work do you do?
I ain't particular. Anything that's a living.
Wait a minute, open your mouth.
Come on, open it wider.
It never fails.
I can always tell the way a man's eyes look.
- Tell what?
- When he has a bad bicuspid.
And that's as bad a bicuspid as I ever seen in 30 years of dentistry.
Bet you've never felt a twinge of pain from that molar yet, have you?
- No.
- You see? That's how bad it is.
That's the kind of tooth that falls apart all at once.
Come on up to the office and I'll fix it for you.
- Put that on the book, Walt.
- All right, Doc.
You sure you know how?
Son, I'm the best dentist in this town... and there's only two ways to be the best dentist in a town.
- One of them is to do the finest work.
- What's the other?
To be the only dentist.
I guess it's kind of hard for an ex-soldier to make a living.
Everybody treats them well when the war is on... but when the war is over, they're sort of out of place.
Get pushed around from pillar to post.
That's bad for a young fella.
It makes him sort of bitter.
Makes him disgusted with conditions.
It sure does.
Gonna be a lot of activity in cattle around here... now that the railroad up in Abilene is finished.
How did you know the railroad was finished?
Ain't it?
Seems to me I read somewhere where they was gonna finish it this month.
Ain't they done with it yet?
I don't know, I was just asking.
That drill hurt?
I've had things done that felt better.
What'd you say?
I said, "I've had things done that felt better."
The dang drill's kind of dull.
Guess I'll have to get some new ones.
There you are.
There's a chance for a man to make a lot of money down here... if he can just get his beef up there.
- Is that so hard?
- It seems to be.
There you are, just bite your teeth together and kind of grind them.
Spit the pieces out.
Rinse your mouth out.
Looks like I might be able to get a job.
You might at that, if you hit the right place.
Come in.
Hello, Matt.
- You want me to come back later, Doc?
- No, we're all through. Come on in.
Son, shake hands with Matt Lashan.
He's got as many cows as the next man, I guess.
Glad to know you.
This is Dan Thomas.
Him and his partner is the ones... that held up them stagecoach bandits and recovered all that money.
That was a mighty fine piece of work.
This boy's full of fire and vinegar, Matt.
Only thing is, he's had a little trouble finding a job and he's sort of disgusted.
Seems like there ought to be something around here he could do.
You're gonna be needing more men, ain't you... now that all them cattle's going up to Abilene?
- Why don't you put him on?
- I might at that.
Once the Doc gets through gnawing on me, we'll talk it over.
Thanks.
Just wait in there.
Get in the chair here, Matt.
Doc, I meant to tell you.
I'll have to work this out.
I don't have any money.
It's only a dollar.
Pay me out of your first month's wages.
How's them sore teeth treating you?
Doc, this one on the right...
Tennessee, will you learn a new tune?
I been listening to that same thing forever and I'm tired of it.
A steer bell's the same thing and you don't get tired of it, do you?
I don't have to bunk in the same room with a steer.
You couldn't anyway.
The steer wouldn't let you.
Evening.
Matt Lashan said I was to bunk here.
I'm a new hand.
Come on in.
He'd have brought me down himself, only he said you'd take good care...
We'll take very good care of you.
Ain't it a small world, though.
Stand still.
Keep those hands right where they are.
Where's that $10,000?
- Can we talk this over?
- Not tonight.
Go get his gun, Tennessee.
Don't shoot. I'm here.
Go after him.
I got him.
Get him inside.
Somebody get a light.
Get him down.
What's the matter with you?
What's going on here?
- Why didn't you say who you were?
- What do you think I was trying to do?
- We thought you were somebody else.
- You mean me?
Nice little reception you had fixed up for me.
But I didn't think it would turn out quite like this.
All right, drop those guns.
Move back in that corner.
Come on, get moving.
Wait a minute, Thomas. Don't be in a rush.
The boys that work for me got pretty good jobs.
We'd kind of like to have you stay, join the family, wouldn't we, boys?
- But that's the fella that held us up.
- I know. That's why I hired him.
There's an empty bunk right over there, next to mine.
I'm Tennessee.
Dan Thomas.
Openly speaking, we're what you might call cattle separators.
- What?
- Don't you savvy?
We separate the cattle from the owners.
We ain't so awful busy, unless someone tries to take a herd up north.
North?
Then we raid them to keep them from getting the cattle to market.
What happens to the cattle you rustle?
We change the brands on them, keep them hid.
When the price gets high enough, we're gonna take them up to Abilene ourselves.
According to that,
Lashan ought to make a lot of money.
We all are.
This ain't the kind of a country a man comes to for his health.
No.
I ain't so much interested in my health, either.
Round them up, boys!
Men, the reason I asked you to meet here in secret like this is... we've got to take some steps to protect ourselves.
I'm fed up on the whole thing.
It ain't worth it.
The trouble with us is, we're not organized like the rustlers are.
Look at Townsend. They slaughtered his cattle and burnt him out.
- I don't want that to happen to me.
- It won't.
From now on, we're going to fight fire with fire.
That's why I asked you to come here.
Right here in Texas, we've got the greatest gunslingers there are.
John Wesley Hardin,
Clay Allison, King Fisher...
Jim Courtright, Manning Clements... and I want to hire them to work for us.
Dusty's right, that's what we need.
Blaire, come on!
What happened?
Father!
I'm going out to California.
I'm going to give Texas back to the outlaws.
- You can't lick this thing by running away.
- And you can't lick something you can't see.
It's four months since Dusty was killed.
Nobody's been caught yet.
All the sheriff ever does is go out and look around and come back and say:
"The rustlers must have come down from the Indian nations."
- We just have to keep on trying.
- It ain't as easy as that, Matthews.
If I could get a fair price for mine,
I'd sell out, too.
Evening, Mike. Evening, Tod.
- Hello, Doc.
- Evening, Doc.
This ain't a very good place for it, is it?
- For what?
- Sparking.
In my day, a young feller didn't stand along the main street doing his sparking.
Doc.
- When's the marriage coming off?
- Marriage?
You've heard of it, ain't you?
He hasn't asked me yet.
Four months and he ain't popped the question yet?
Evening, Bert.
I think we'd better go in now, don't...
You may know how to run a ranch, young man, but you sure can't run her.
We might as well go in.
Yes, I guess we better.
Good evening, folks.
Hello, there, how are you? Oh, Albert.
Doc, how about a little tune while we're waiting?
I ain't heard that organ since you brought it in here.
- You will tonight.
- Learnt to play it yet?
I don't have to.
I got a first class accompanist.
- Mike.
- Yeah?
They want a little music.
- How about wakening them up?
- Sure.
Tod here can do the pumping.
He ought to be useful for something.
- I thought you said this meeting was free.
- It is.
Kind of looks like I'm paying.
Tod, see that man over there with the leather jacket?
- What about him?
- He's the one who held me up.
Yeah?
- Come here, I'd like to talk...
- Tod, you old buzzard.
You old son of a gun, what are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?
- How'd you get away?
- They couldn't run fast.
- I thought they'd have...
What is this?
You two act like long-lost brothers.
- We are, sort of.
- lf it isn't the Cactus Kid.
- Hello.
- Stay away from me.
Yeah, what's this about you trying to kidnap her?
Is that what she told you?
- I wasn't trying to kidnap her.
- You were, too.
I was just in a hurry to get a ride that day.
You ought to remember.
That day? Mike, this is Danny.
He's the fella I told you about.
Mike, I'm sorry for the way I messed you up...
- but then you were awful stubborn.
- I was...
All I wanted was one horse, but you...
You were lucky I didn't take a shot at you, that's all.
That makes us even. Friends?
Mike, Tod, come on over here.
Let's get this music started before these folks fall asleep.
All right, Doc.
- Come on, you can help me pump.
- Sure enough.
Now we're gonna start with Buffalo Gals.
And I want you to whoop it up when I get to you.
Give me a "G" or something on that organ there.
As I was walking down the street
Down the street, down the street
A pretty little girl I chanced to meet
And she was fair to view
Oh, ain't ya, ain't ya, ain't ya, ain't ya
Coming out tonight, coming out tonight,
coming out tonight
Oh, ain't ya, ain't ya, ain't ya, ain't ya
coming out tonight
And dance by the light of the moon
Her teeth were white as the drifted snow
The drifted snow, the drifted snow
She said she bought them
in a hardware store
She was fair to view
Oh, ain't ya, ain't ya, ain't ya, ain't ya
coming out tonight
coming out tonight, coming out tonight
Oh, ain't ya, ain't ya, ain't ya, ain't ya
coming out tonight
- Ain't you?
- And dance by the light of the moon
Your eyes are like the stars so bright
Stars so bright, stars so bright
I hope they don't come out at night
You are so fair to view
Oh, ain't ya, ain't ya, ain't ya, ain't ya
I thought you were gonna help me pump.
I can't pump and look at her at the same time.
That's the girl for me.
Want to come to the wedding?
Now look here, Danny, Mike is not...
She bellered like an ailing steer
She was fair to
And she was
She
- What's the matter here?
- I don't know. The handle came out.
The dang thing's always coming out.
Get it right in.
- There. Now, get going.
- All right.
That's just fine.
Keep right on going.
I'm a hen-pecked man
but I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
Her father's got millions and she's the heir
And she was fair to view
Oh, ain't ya, ain't ya, ain't ya, ain't ya
coming out tonight
coming out tonight, coming out tonight
Oh, ain't ya, ain't ya, ain't ya, ain't ya
coming out tonight
And dance by the light of the moon
Hello, Windy.
I'm sorry I'm so late.
I've been entertaining them. Take it away.
Right you are.
It sure is good to see you all again... but we'll get sociable a little bit later.
I'll get right down to business.
I guess you all know why I came down here from Abilene.
I worked hard promoting a railroad to haul cattle... and I ain't getting no cattle.
These cattle ain't quail.
They can't fly up there.
That's a point.
But you don't realise how badly the East needs beef since the war has been over.
Maybe you can tell us how to get them through the rustlers and Indians and raids.
If you think it's so easy to get them there...
- why don't you take them yourself?
- Yeah.
Brother, that's exactly why I'm here.
I'm going to buy the beef from you right here and take it through myself.
But, remember this: it's going to be just as tough on me getting this beef to Abilene as it was on you.
That's right.
Since I'm the one who has to take all the risk...
I feel that it's only fair that we establish a price... that will give me at least an even break.
Since I'm the one who's going to have to worry about the stampedes and things...
I figure that a fair price for your beef would be...
- $2 a head.
That wouldn't even pay for the hide.
Just a minute, friends.
I knew this was too good to be true.
You'd think from the way you're acting
I was trying to rustle your cattle.
There ain't a man in here who can say that I ever took advantage of a living soul.
You're being a little unreasonable.
I think $2 a head for your beef is a fair price.
- What'll you sell them for?
- Yeah, what'll you get for them?
I don't even know
I'm going to get them through.
I might have to turn back the same as you did.
Windy's right. We can't get them through... and there ain't no sense of fooling ourselves anymore.
Of course, $2 a head ain't very much.
You can have mine for $2.
I've got 4,000 heads you can have at $2.
Mine, too, I have 5,000.
You can have the Flying W.
- What's the matter with you?
- Listen, friends!
Maybe Windy is trying to help us... and then again, maybe he is trying to help himself.
You know as well as I do if the East hasn't had beef for four years... the market price is way up.
That means the average steer should bring
$15, $18 a head, maybe more.
I ask you people, just who do you think Windy's more interested in: us or himself?
Please, just a minute.
Shut up. Go ahead, Tod, say your piece.
- Yeah, go ahead.
- All right.
All I'm saying is that the $2 a head that Windy's offering... that may be a lot of money to his way of thinking.
But $18 a head is a whole lot more and that's what we can get in Abilene.
You've tried it and failed.
Sure we failed because this is the same as the gold rush.
Everybody trying to get there first.
But you've proven what Dusty King tried to tell them for months.
That the only way we'll make it is to get together a big herd.
The biggest this state ever saw... and some of them are bound to get through.
I ask you men here with big herds... isn't $18 a head worth taking some risks for?
- Come on outside and settle it like a man.
- What?
They're gonna be talking about cattle for hours, let's go.
I happen to be interested in what they're talking about.
That's because you've never listened to me.
Come on. Tod can take care of that.
What?
- Nope, you ain't.
- I ain't what?
You ain't as pretty in the moonlight as you are in the sunlight.
Why you, blankety-blank hamstrung hunk of jerky beef, l...
Don't get upset, nobody's perfect.
- I'll marry you, anyway.
- You...
I wouldn't marry you...
- if you were the last man in the world.
- Last man in the world.
Good night, Mike.
Come in.
Sit in the chair there, Windy.
It kind of bothered you, didn't it?
First time in my life I ever upset the apple cart with one of my own speeches.
There ain't no use denying it.
We've got a mess on our hands.
You may remember I didn't want to come to Texas in the first place.
- It was your idea.
- This is not the first idea... something's happened to us.
You got a bad bicuspid there.
Wait a minute.
You fixed that the last time I was here.
- I did?
- You sure did.
It looks like there ain't but one thing left to do. That's to get Tod Ramsey.
- I can go out there...
- I like you, Matt.
You're a simple man of direct action.
Thanks, Doc.
But it so happens that's the worst thing we could do right now.
Let me take a look at that, Windy.
After that meeting tonight...
Tod Ramsey will be the rallying point for every rancher in this section.
- Are you sure I put that in?
- Yes.
You ought to know.
If he gets hurt, I'm afraid people will begin to wonder why.
That's 100% right. But remember this, Doc... if one man gets through to Abilene with his cattle... we might as well throw all our ideas out the window.
This young squirt ain't going to get through.
We've just got to begin all over again... at the beginning.
It came out.
I knew that wasn't one of mine.
It's one of them dang Kansas City jobs.
You go back to Abilene, Windy.
Matt, you take 1,000 head and join the drive.
That's crazy, Doc. Me join the drive? lt'll be crazier if you don't.
The colour of this whole thing has changed in the last few hours.
Every rancher around here is going with him... and the quickest way to attract attention to yourself is not to go.
- But you're gonna raid them, ain't you?
- You can bet your life we are.
This time, they'll know it, too.
It'll hit them so hard that in the future... not a man in this state will move a steer out of his own backyard.
What do you know? You had two bad ones.
That's the trouble with using that cheap stuff.
A little gold in that.
Forward eight, fall back eight
Forward again, with a right, left through
and a right, left back
Meet your pardner, promenade eight
Round the old track
till you come out straight
Alaman left with your left hand,
back to your pardner, right and left grand
Rope that cow, brand that calf
Meet your honey with a once and a half
Treat them all alike, treat them all the same
Treat them all alike, no cheating in the game
Meet your pardner with an elbow whirl
Promenade around the world
Promenade, you know where, I don't care
And put that pretty girl in this chair
Time out for refreshments.
While I'm still up here,
I want to make a little speech.
Tomorrow is a big day in the history of Texas.
Tod Ramsey is going up the trail... with 6,000 head of cattle.
Seven thousand, Doc, you forgot mine.
Thanks, Lashan.
Seven thousand head of cattle.
I want to say... here's hoping he gets through to Abilene, without losing a single steer.
- Sanctimonious old buzzard, ain't you?
- It pays, don't it?
- How's things?
- Fine, Doc.
Boys all set?
- They're riding advance guard.
- Guard?
- Just to see that nothing happens.
- That's good.
- Doc, I want to talk to you about my teeth.
- What's the matter with them?
They're noisy, that's what they are, listen.
They're bound to clatter a little at first until they get set.
That ain't what you told me.
Just keep right on chewing with them and they'll be fine.
You'll get them back if they don't stop clicking.
Why so quiet?
- I'm just thinking.
- What about?
Why are you going to New Orleans?
To see about a new cattle market.
- How long you gonna be gone?
- Couple of weeks.
- Going to miss me?
- You know I will.
I'll miss you, too.
But then we'll be together a long time after we're married.
What's the matter?
You are in love with me, aren't you?
- Is that what this is? Love?
- What else?
I don't know, Dan.
It's all happened so fast.
That's the way it's supposed to happen.
Fast.
- What about it? When do we hit them?
- I want to talk about that.
We've already let them come farther than Lashan said.
He said to hit them after they crossed the Red River.
They did that three days ago.
I know what he said.
You've told me enough.
Why don't we move in there and break up that drive?
You act like you got a private reason for not wanting to.
I have. Money.
Money?
Did you fellas ever try figure out what you're getting out of this?
- $45 a month.
- But we got a promise of a lot more.
You can't spend promises.
Look, we're rustling.
Somebody's making big money out of the cattle we rustle.
Yet we take all the risks.
Ain't we entitled to some of the profits?
Maybe we are, but Lashan would never stand for that.
I don't think he'll have anything to say about that.
Wait a minute.
Lashan's a friend of mine and I'm not going to stand by and see anybody do him dirt.
Hold that, Comstock... and let Danny finish what he was going to say.
None of us ever expects to have more than $50 apiece in our lives.
But if I tell you how we can have
$2,000, $3,000, maybe $4,000 each... who would you listen to, me or Lashan?
- I'd listen to you.
- So would I.
- Me, too.
- I thought Lashan was a friend of yours.
Well, he's $50 worth a friend, not $2,000.
Then we're all agreed.
- Sure.
- Yeah.
Go ahead.
We don't bother those cattle at all.
We let them go right on into Abilene.
- What are we gonna do?
- I'm working on that.
- What's the matter? Lose something?
- No, of course not.
Abilene's only about
10 or 12 miles from here.
- I ought to be back before dark.
- Think it'll work?
Can't help it.
This is the only road running south.
They gotta pass this way. See you later.
Kind of slick, ain't it?
- Who's the cattle buyer around here?
- I am.
I'm with that herd coming up from Texas.
You might like to know we're bedded down 10 miles out.
Be here in the morning.
Don't tell anybody else about it.
I want them all.
First come, first served.
I'll come buy them right there.
How many heads you got?
- Seven thousand.
- I'll be there in an hour.
Bring the money with you.
Windy, I been looking for you.
- They got through.
- How do you know?
A cowboy just rode in.
Says they're bedding down 10 miles out.
Parkhill and the others are going to buy the cattle.
We got to hurry. You find Red and get the horses, I'll go pick up some money.
- Are they coming?
- They took it hook, line, and sinker.
They ought to be here in about a half an hour.
- Got any more coffee there?
- What's this?
- Must be them.
- They sure didn't lose any time.
- Looks like they're anxious to do business.
- So are we, better get mounted.
What is this?
Hello, Windy, what are you doing here?
- Where's them cattle?
- About five or six miles further on.
- Why? You aiming to buy them?
- Yes, and if I don't get there first...
I'll have to pay three prices for the lot of them.
- What's so funny?
- Windy, we're gonna give you an even break.
One price for the whole herd.
Hand over that money.
I ain't gonna argue. Hand it over or I'll blow you off that horse and pick it up myself.
You sure you're not making a mistake?
- Come on, where is it?
- It's in my saddlebag.
- Pretty cute little trick.
- Ain't it?
- Just wanted to make sure.
- Think this up all by yourself?
Yeah. Come on, get off your horse.
- What?
- Get off!
How're we gonna get back to Abilene?
That 7,000 head of cattle you just bought... will be along here first thing in the morning.
Just pick out the ones that fit your legs and hop aboard.
That dirty little polecat can't do this to me!
Why didn't you do something?
All right, Mr. Ramsey, there's your cheque.
I'll take all the beef you can bring up.
We'll be back. The trail's open now.
- There's no stopping us.
- Good luck to you.
This calls for a little celebration.
Sure does.
You boys go on down to Bullshead.
- See you there soon as I cash this.
- We'll be there.
I've known for a week something was wrong...
- but I couldn't do nothing by myself.
- This is wonderful.
It was my idea to get the railroad here to haul in the beef.
I fought to bring in the first herd.
Now the town's full of cattle... and not a single head of them is mine.
And just to make it perfect,
I'm out $20,000 on the deal.
You got to blame Doc Thorpe for that.
He hired Thomas.
This country ain't so big, but what
I won't catch up with him one of these days.
- What are we going to do now?
- You do what you like.
I got to be the first to go down and congratulate the cowboys... on getting through to Abilene.
You already bought what you wanted. Let's get out of here.
- What's the matter, scared?
- No, but this is Windy Miller's town.
We're crazy to be here.
We're asking for trouble.
Maybe you should've gone back with the others.
I was just saying how crazy...
Go and see if the blacksmith's done with our horses.
I'll meet you as soon as I pick up the saddle.
We're going to walk smack-dab into something.
- Finished?
- Almost.
You by any chance one of them Texans who brought up the cattle?
Yeah.
I thought nobody but a Texan would buy a fancy thing like this.
Hurry it up, will you?
Listen here, young feller, nobody ever done good work by hurrying yet.
And I ain't gonna spoil the looks of this saddle by doing a bad job of engraving.
Looks all right to me.
Then your eyesight's bad, because I ain't finished the "E."
Out of my light.
Come on up, fellows. It's on Texas!
No. He hasn't got that much nerve.
Maybe not, but he's in the saddle store right now.
I'll see you boys in a couple of minutes.
You must think an awful lot of this Mike... to give him as costly a saddle as this.
There you are. Take it away.
- Anything extra?
- No, Mike's thrown in.
What's your hurry, Tex?
I didn't expect to see you so soon.
I want that money back.
Sorry, Windy. It's too late.
I wouldn't if I were you. Drop it.
Don't bother to come back to Texas
'cause I'm taking over.
Come on, Danny, get off the street.
Windy Miller.
When I tell my grandchildren about this, they won't believe it.
What are you doing in Abilene?
Where'd you get money for the saddle?
I told you my Uncle Rodney died.
You're not fooling me.
You held up those cattle buyers.
Think what you like.
I see the answer to a lot of things folks back home have been wondering about.
You fell on one side of the fence and I fell on the other.
- It's too late to argue about it.
- I won't argue, but...
Don't give me a lecture on morals.
You saved my life and I saved yours.
That makes us even.
And what I do from now on is none of your business.
Yes, it is, because I happen to be in love with Mike, too.
I never said anything to her... because I knew how she felt about you.
That was all right with me up to now.
- So?
- You can't have her.
I don't think you'll have much to say about that.
I'm saying it now.
Danny, we gotta get out of here.
Somebody just killed Windy Miller and we'll get blamed, sure as shooting.
Got him smack-dab through the heart.
Sorry it had to end this way, Danny.
Remember what I told you.
Look at all the decorations.
Wonder what's going on.
Must be fixing up to welcome us back.
As long as you don't see a rope with a noose at one end, it ain't for us.
Giddyup.
Hello, there.
Hi, Doc. What's all the flags out for?
Tod Ramsey and the others got through to Abilene with their cattle.
We're fixing to welcome them home.
That's fine. Now maybe
Lashan will pay us that back salary.
This ought to cause a lot of debts to be paid off.
- How was New Orleans?
- All right.
- Spare me a minute?
- I guess so. What's on your mind?
Come on up to the office.
- Wait here for me, Tennessee.
- Sure.
I understand you're taking over
Matt Lashan's ranch?
- News travels fast, don't it?
- Don't it?
Matt and I made sort of a deal.
- That's a bad deal for you.
- Yeah? Why?
It ain't his to begin with.
- Whose is it?
- It's mine.
- Yours?
- That's right.
- Then you and Windy were a combine?
- Yeah.
I gotta hand it to you, Doc, you're all right.
Thank you, Danny, so are you.
You're a little ambitious... but I think we can work that out, can't we?
Anything you say from now on goes, Doc.
I gotta take my hat off to you.
I ain't butting in, am I, boys?
You're faster than the telegraph.
Ain't you forgot what I told you up in Abilene?
Take it easy, Danny.
If he's in, I'm out.
We can settle this later.
Put that hogleg away.
If you and me's gonna be partners, you're gonna have to depend on me a little.
Go on.
I like you, Dan. I like the way you act... even though you did let them cattle get through.
What's done is done and maybe it's for the best after all.
It sort of establishes this Tod Ramsey as a man able to perform miracles.
From now on, they'll sort of look up to him as a leader... since he's inherited Dusty's place.
They'll go when he goes, not before.
And if he don't go at all, they won't go at all.
Don't that sound simple?
- All we have to do is kill Tod Ramsey.
- Exactly.
That'll scare them off.
And even if two or three more do try to get through after that... they won't be hard to stop.
I think you forgot something, ain't you, Doc?
Wait a minute, Danny.
In a normal situation...
I can see where a young man would rebel at the idea of killing his best friend... but this ain't a normal situation.
It's just like a bad bicuspidy.
I'm with you all the way, Doc, except we don't touch Tod.
Let's not you and me start this partnership with a difference of opinion.
I'm better qualified to do the thinking than you are.
You better start thinking then, because we're not gonna touch Tod.
Blankety-blank.
Ain't that a new petticoat?
- I ought to... Oh, Danny.
- Hi, Mike.
That's a fine way to treat a present
I bring, kicking it around like that.
Present? What?
It's the most beautiful thing I ever saw.
It's got my name on it.
- You shouldn't buy me presents like this.
- That's only the beginning.
I'm so happy I could almost explode.
Everything happens at once.
Tod sells our cattle, and you come home.
- Did you miss me?
- More than you'll ever know.
We'll take care of that.
Let's get married. Right away. Today.
Without Tod?
- What's Tod got to do with it?
- He's your best friend.
- We'll surprise him.
- No, I couldn't.
Why not?
Silly, a girl can't just square off and get married like that.
You have to have clothes...
Besides, they're coming back from Abilene tomorrow.
Lashan's here now and he said the others were right behind him.
You wouldn't want me... to have all the excitement in my life at one time, would you?
It seems the wrong way to start out married life... but you're the boss.
Here they come!
- Tod.
- Mike.
It's about time you paid some attention to me.
- Nice going, Tod.
- To think that you've really done it.
- lf only Dad could have been here.
- That would have been nice.
- How was New Orleans?
- Fine.
You should see the wonderful present he brought me.
Wouldn't be a saddle by any chance, would it?
- How did you know?
- I know Danny.
- You're not married yet, are you?
- No, we were waiting for you.
That was thoughtful of you.
Tod, come on, we're waiting for you.
Come on, hurry up.
The gang is here watching.
All right, I'm coming.
I guess I better get over there.
Do you mind if I tear your prospective bridegroom away for a drink to celebrate?
No, take him along.
Why don't they have saloons that women can go into?
- I'll build you one.
- Oh, you.
Come on here.
- Fine job, fella.
- Thanks.
What's it gonna be?
- Bourbon.
- Bourbon.
- Nice work, Tod.
- Thanks, Bob.
Here you are, my boy, the best in the house.
- When did you start drinking?
- Just now.
- I want to shake hands with you, Tod.
- Thanks, Stub.
Go in the back room. I want to talk to you.
- Go on, talk.
- This is private, go on.
I'll see you later, fellows.
I've been with you long enough to know you can't be made to do anything.
But you've gotta see this isn't fair to Mike.
- What ain't fair?
- Marrying her.
Why don't you say you want her for yourself?
That has nothing to do with it.
Sure, you're just thinking of her future.
I wouldn't call it very much of a future being married to you... spending the rest of her life on the run.
I ain't running anywhere.
I can take care of myself.
- Sure, you can, but what about her?
- Let's drop it.
You said it once yourself.
You fell on one side of the fence,
I fell on the other.
That's the way it still is and I got a feeling that's the way it'll always be.
Is that any kind of life to offer a girl? Is it?
You know it isn't. You're just too doggone stubborn to admit it.
Come on, what do you say?
Let's get out of here.
I'll leave with you.
That's how much I think of her.
- You would, too, wouldn't you?
- Let's get started.
You don't have to leave with me.
- He shot Tod.
- Run, Danny, run.
Break it up.
All right, Lashan.
Go around the other way.
Pardon me, Sheriff.
On the roof.
What do you think, Doc?
He ain't bad hurt, just a flesh wound.
Get him to my office.
Pick him up.
Tod, what happened?
They say Danny shot you.
- That's not true, he didn't.
- Then who did?
I don't know, but it wasn't Danny.
- We've got to do something.
- Now...
If those men catch him, they'll kill him.
Don't worry. They won't catch him.
They won't even come close.
He's in there, men, spread out.
Danny!
As I was strolling down the street
Down the street, down the street
A pretty little girl I chanced to meet
And she was fair to view
Oh, ain't ya, ain't ya, ain't ya, ain't ya
coming out tonight, coming out
This is it, Doc.
Wait a minute, Danny.
Don't you think we'd better talk this thing over?
Oh, Danny.
Hya! Hya!
Hya! Hya! Hya! Come on, dogie!
Whoa...
Texas?
Chihuahua steers.
- Howdy.
- Howdy.
My name's Clanton. This is my boy, Ike. My oldest boy.
Any sweet water up beyond?
Yeah. Two, three miles straight up the trail.
- Cattle look pretty scrawny.
- Yeah.
Me and my brothers, we're trailing them on to California.
If you ain't committed to no shipper,
I'll take them off your hands.
Not interested.
Make you a good offer. Pay you in silver, three dollars a head.
Nope.
- Might raise you to five dollars silver.
- Paid more than that in Mexico.
They'll be a sorry-looking lot when you get to California.
They'll feed out when we get to grass country.
Sure is rough-looking country.
Ain't no cow country. Mighty different where I come from.
- What do they call this place?
- Just over the rise, big town...
- ...called Tombstone. Fine town.
- Tombstone?
Yeah, I heard of it.
Well, me and my brothers... might ride in there tonight. Get ourselves a shave, glass of beer.
You'd enjoy yourself. Wide awake, wide-open town, Tombstone.
- Get anything you want there.
- Thank you.
James, this is mighty fine chow.
One of these days you're gonna be as good a cook as Ma.
- I'm learning and trying.
- That's what I'm telling him.
Corey Sue ain't marrying him because he's pretty. Because he's a good cook.
There goes that chingadera again.
That sure is a mighty pretty piece of brass.
Brass? That's solid silver.
Twenty-five American dollars' worth of solid silver, ain't it, brother Wyatt?
It sure is, James.
Don't let him fool you.
Gonna look mighty pretty in them curls of Corey Sue's.
Ain't that the truth now.
Let's mount up. If we're going to town, let's get going.
Twenty-five dollars gold.
By gollies, you sure got a bargain.
- Whoa, girl! Whoa!
- So long, James.
So long, James.
So long, Wyatt. Morgan.
So long, Virgil.
There it is. Tombstone.
Let's go.
Good evening, gentlemen. Welcome to the Bon Ton Tonsorial Parlor.
- Barbershop?
- Well, if you want to call it that.
What can I do for you?
- Shave.
- Hair cut?
- Shave.
- We give baths too.
Shave.
I don't know how to work it so good. Only had it a week.
Come all the way from Chicago.
- Say, you fellows miners?
- No.
- Prospectors?
- We're cattlemen... just passing through here.
Shave, please.
Hey!
Hey, barber!
What kind of a town is this?
Barber!
Luke, you know your duty. You and your marshals go and get him out.
That's Indian Charlie in there, drunk.
I ain't committing suicide on myself.
- Me neither.
- I ain't going in there.
What kind of a town is this anyway?
Excuse me, ma'am.
A man can't get a shave without getting his head blown off.
You're the marshal. Get that drunk Indian.
- Why don't you?
- They ain't paying me for it.
And they ain't paying me enough either.
Young man, you be careful!
It's all right, ladies.
I don't blame old Luke.
I wouldn't go in there either.
What kind of a town is this anyway, selling liquor to Indians?
Ow.
Put a knot on his head bigger than a turkey's egg.
Indian, get out of town and stay out.
How'd you like to stay on here, as marshal?
Nope. Barber!
- 200 a month goes with this badge.
- Not interested.
I'm just passing through trying to get a relaxing shave.
- We'll make it 250.
- Not interested.
Hey, Mr. Bon Ton!
- Shave, please.
- We want to thank you, Mr...?
- Earp. Wyatt Earp.
- What?
You're not the marshal from Dodge City?
Ex-marshal.
The cattle's gone!
James!
James!
- Mayor, is that marshaling job still open?
- It is.
- I'll take it.
- It's yours.
Providing my brothers are my deputies.
- When do you want to start?
- Now.
- Who runs the gambling around here?
- Doc Holliday, mostly.
- Who runs the cattle?
- The Clantons.
Old man Clanton and his four sons.
Good evening, Mr. Clanton.
Good evening.
The fellow with the trail herd, remember?
Oh, sure, I remember you.
You was right. I didn't get very far with them.
They was rustled this evening.
That so?
Well, that's too bad.
Guess you ain't heading for California, huh?
No. I figured on sticking around a while.
Got myself a job.
- Cowpunching?
- Marshaling.
Marshaling? In Tombstone?
Well! Good luck to you, Mr...?
Earp. Wyatt Earp.
Eighteen years.
Didn't get much of a chance, did you, James?
I wrote to Pa and Corey Sue. They're gonna be all busted up over it.
Corey Sue's young. But Pa, guess he'll never get over it.
I'll be coming out to see you regular,
James. So will Morg and Virg.
We're gonna be around here for a while.
Can't tell. Maybe when we leave this country... young kids like you will be able to grow up and live safe.
- What'd you find?
- I followed their trail... from Clanton country to the river.
They're moving cattle, all right.
Well, get yourself some sleep. There's coffee on the stove and some beans.
Morg's riding shotgun to Tucson.
Say, maybe I'd better ask around the banks while I'm down there.
They're too smart for that.
Chihuahua, sing us the one about the old blind mule.
Hey, Mac. I hear Doc's coming back tonight.
Well, maybe he is and maybe he ain't. I ain't heard.
Well, do you know where he's been?
Tucson. Over the border.
Who knows where Doc goes?
I love poker.
Yes, sir, I really love poker.
Every hand a different problem.
I've got to do a little figuring here.
What would I do if I was in your boots, Mr. Gambler?
You drew three cards and I stood pat... and yet you raised me.
Now the question is, what should I do?
Yeah, mighty interesting game, poker. A game of chance.
Listen, miss, I admire poker, but you're increasing the odds.
- I catch you doing that again, I'll run...
- Listen, Mr. Tin Star Marshal.
This is Doc Holliday's town, and when he comes back...
Sorry, but I don't like eight-handed poker deals.
- Mr. Marshal, you don't think that I...
- Oh, no.
- Well, where were we?
- He just raised you, marshal.
Oh, yeah.
Well, seeing as you know
I got three of a kind...
I guess I'll...
How are you, Doc?
Have a good trip?
Doc Holliday.
Nice-looking fella.
Don't let's have trouble.
I told you to get out of town and stay out.
- Oh, Doc, I'll cut you in on the game...
- I told you to get out of town.
Check me in, will you?
That door's for ladies and gentlemen.
Go on with your game, gentlemen.
Well, you can cash me in. It's getting late. I'll see you all later.
This sure is a hard town for a fella to have a quiet game of poker in.
- Howdy.
- Good evening.
- I'm...
- Wyatt Earp. I know.
I know all about you and your reason for being here.
I've heard a lot about you too, Doc.
You left your mark around in
Deadwood, Denver and places.
In fact, a man could almost follow your trail going from graveyard to graveyard.
There's one here too.
The biggest graveyard west of the Rockies.
Marshals and I usually get along better when we understand that right away.
- Get your meaning, Doc.
- Good. Have a drink?
Thanks. Believe I will.
Mac, a glass of champagne for the marshal.
Make it whiskey.
You're my guest, marshal.
Champagne.
Champagne it is, Mac.
- Plan on staying here long?
- A while.
Till you catch the rustlers that killed your brother?
- That's the general idea.
- What's the specific idea?
I don't follow you, quite.
You haven't taken it into your head to deliver us from all evil?
I hadn't thought of it quite like that. But it ain't a bad idea.
- That's what I'm getting paid for.
- Let's get down to cases, marshal.
I, for instance.
How would you handle me if I took a notion to break the law?
- You already have.
- For example?
Running that tinhorn out of town.
That's none of your business.
I see we're in opposite camps, marshal. Draw.
- Can't.
- We can take care of that easily enough.
Mac!
My brother Morg's gun.
The big one, that's Morg.
The other one, that good-looking fellow, that's my brother Virg.
- This is Doc Holliday, fellas.
- Hiya, Doc.
- Howdy.
- Howdy.
Have a drink.
Don't mind if I do, Doc.
- Join us, Mac.
- Yes, sir. Thank you.
Gentlemen.
- Your health.
- Your health, Doc.
Thank you.
Come, my good man. Give me service, or I'll take my patronage elsewhere.
Your foot, sir.
Champagne.
- The actor in tonight's show.
- Shakespeare in Tombstone.
Coming right up, Mr. Shakespeare.
It's been a long time since
I've heard Shakespeare.
How would you like to join me tonight?
Yeah, fine.
See he gets to the theater or there won't be a show.
- Mac, cash in for me, will you?
- Yes, sir.
Take Mr. Thorndyke to the Bird Cage.
Bird Cage? You're incarcerating me in a bird cage, sir?
- That's the name of the theater.
- The theater? The show!
Good heavens, the show must go on.
Lead on.
Drinks on the house.
May I present my friend, Wyatt Earp.
Him? A friend?
- "He." Not "him."
- Well, he or him.
He ain't no friend of mine.
What she's trying to say,
Doc, is, we've met before.
Sort of found ourselves together in a eight-handed poker game.
Ladies... and gentlemen.
Owing to circumstances that
I had nothing to do with... the show The Convict's Oath will not appear tonight.
But as if I didn't already have enough trouble... that eminent actor, that sterling tragedian...
Mr. Granville...
Thorndyke! has completely disappeared.
Wait a minute. What are you acting so mad about?
This is the fourth time this year this happened.
Bird imitators. Bird imitators, that's all we get.
- I can explain that.
- What are you fixing to do?
Be reasonable. All we want to do is ride him round town... a couple of times on the rail.
Well, that sounds reasonable enough to me.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I got a better idea.
Just give me 15 minutes and I think I can find this Mr...
Thorndyke!
I'll bring him back here. Now sit down.
Take your seats and have another beer.
Look, Yorick, can't you give us nothing but them poems?
I have a very large repertoire, sir.
Great. All right, Yorick, go ahead. Shoot.
Minstrel, pray help me.
Wait. I want to hear this.
Thank you.
To be, or not to be, that is the question...
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind... to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune... or to take arms against a sea of troubles... and by opposing, end them.
To die, to sleep, no more... and by a sleep to say we end the heartaches... and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to.
'Tis a consummation devoutly to be wished.
To die, to sleep.
To sleep, perchance to dream.
Ay, there's the rub... for in that sleep of death... what dreams may come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil...
That's enough. That's enough.
You don't know nothing but them poems.
You can't sing.
Maybe you can dance.
Leave him alone.
Please go on, Mr. Thorndyke.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Must give us pause.
There's the respect that makes calamity of so long life... for who would bear the whips and scorns of time... the law's delay... the insolence of office... and the spurns that patient merit of the unworthy take... when he himself might his quietus make with a bare bodkin?
Who would fardels bear, to grunt and sweat under a weary life...
Life...
Please help me, sir.
But that the dread of something after death...
Would you carry on? I'm afraid...
It's been so long.
The undiscovered country... from whose bourn no traveler returns... puzzles the will... and makes us rather bear those ills we have... than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all...
They're waiting for you at the theater, Mr. Thorndyke.
Thank you, sir.
Shakespeare was not meant for taverns, nor for tavern louts.
Yo rick stays here.
My apologies, marshal. Ike and
Phin have had a little whiskey.
I figured they're just having some fun.
Come on, Mr. Thorndyke,
I'll take you to the theater.
Stop!
Stop, Pa! Stop!
- When you pull a gun, kill a man.
- Yes, Pa.
Whoa! Whoa!
Tombstone, folks.
All out for breakfast.
How's that, Bill? How's that?
Go on. Get up there. Go on. Get up.
- How're you this morning, Earp?
- Fine.
How are things in
Deadwood, Mr. Gambler?
All right, I guess.
- Brother with you?
- No.
Get yourself some flapjacks. The stage is leaving in 30 minutes.
See you're on it.
Thank you.
- I'll prepare a room for you.
- Thank you.
Can I help you, ma'am?
Dad's usually here to take care of the...
- Is that your duffel up there?
- Yes.
Alice, give me a stack of buckwheat cakes with plenty of molasses... and a steak, rare. A couple hunks of bacon if you got some... and a big pot of coffee.
I'm looking for Dr. John Holliday.
- You mean Doc Holliday?
- Well, I imagine so.
Doc Holliday. Why, he rode out of town about 3:00 this morning, heading south.
I don't know when he'll be back, ma'am.
He'll most likely be back suppertime.
Maybe you'd like to have some breakfast, freshen up a bit.
I would like some coffee.
- Have you got a room for Miss...
- Carter. Clementine Carter.
Thank you.
See if Josefina can't get a few buckets of hot water so she can take a bath.
Yes, marshal.
That's Doc's room. You're across the hall from him.
John's room?
Oh, that's John with a mustache.
He is a good surgeon, isn't he?
I wouldn't know, ma'am.
That's a nice picture of you.
All right, folks, all together now.
Tombstone is grateful to you for a wonderful performance.
Mr. Mayor, I'm touched by your tribute.
- Have my card.
- Thank you very much.
Sorry you're leaving.
Here's your bill.
The bill.
Thank you.
Great souls by instinct to each other turn... demand allegiance, and in friendship burn.
Goodnight, sweet prince.
- Goodbye!
- Parting is such sweet sorrow.
- Would you like a glass of beer, ma'am?
- No, thank you.
I'm looking for Dr. John Holliday.
- Who?
- Dr. John Holliday.
Oh. Well, I'll see if I can find him for you, ma'am.
Thank you.
- Go right in, ma'am.
- Thank you.
Gentlemen!
Hello, John.
Clem!
I'd like you to meet my friend.
Wyatt Earp, Miss Clementine Carter.
We've met. Good evening.
Howdy, ma'am. I'll see you both later.
Let's eat.
What are you up to?
It's wonderful to see you again, John.
You are pleased that I came?
- My coming has made you unhappy.
- It was ill-advised.
Any less ill-advised than the way you left Boston?
- How'd you know I was here?
- I didn't.
Finding you hasn't been easy.
From cow camp to cow camp.
From one mining town to another.
If nothing more, you should be flattered to have a girl chase you.
- Clem, you've got to get out of here.
- But I'm not.
This is no place for your kind of person.
What kind of a person am I, John?
Please go back home, Clem.
Back where you belong.
Forget that...
- Does this happen to John frequently?
- Oui, mademoiselle, each time is worse.
You're ill, John.
- So that's the reason you left.
- That has nothing to do with it.
Foolish, foolish John. As if that would have mattered.
I tell you, the condition of my health has nothing to do with it.
I don't believe you, John.
Then I'll give you the truth.
The man you once knew is no more.
There's not a vestige of him left. Nothing.
- I'll take you back to the hotel.
- Please, John.
You can't send me away like this.
You can't run away from me, any more than you can run away from yourself.
Now I know why you don't care whether you live or die.
Why you've tried to get yourself killed.
I've heard all about you, John, and you're wrong, so wrong.
You've got no right to destroy yourself.
You have a world of friends back home who love you, John. And I love you.
There's a stage leaving in the morning for the East.
Take it.
If you don't, I'm moving on.
Very well, John. I'll go.
Dr. John Holliday!
From where I stand, that tin badge you wear... doesn't give you the right to stick your nose in my personal affairs.
What's eating you, Doc?
Why didn't you tell me
Miss Carter was here?
She told you why. She wanted to surprise you.
Give me a clean glass, Mac.
- Don't start drinking whiskey again.
- Give me a glass, Mac.
I'll pour it.
Doc.
That stuff'll kill you.
Why don't you go away?
Squall your stupid little songs and leave me alone.
- I'll see if I can get Doc to bed.
- Finish your supper.
- Have a drink.
- No, thanks, Doc.
I said, have a drink.
No, thanks, I just finished supper.
Look, Doc, I ain't trying to poke my nose into your personal affairs.
But from where I stand... a man would have to go a long ways to find a finer girl than Miss Carter.
Or a prettier one, for that matter.
Ain't no man around who wouldn't give his shirt to...
Marshal.
You've said enough.
Just as you say, Doc.
And this isn't any of your business, either.
Keep that up, and you'll be out of business.
You've just given me a brilliant idea, marshal.
It's time I tempted fate.
Let's see...
Who's in here I don't particularly like?
That's a sucker game, Doc.
There's probably 50 fellas in town waiting to see you get liquored up... so they can fill you full of holes.
Build themselves up a great reputation.
The man that killed Doc Holliday.
Mac, give me a hand and let's get him to bed.
All right.
- You don't think that's kind of...
- No, sir! No, sir!
New chair gets in next week from Kansas City, Kansas.
Fine. Fine.
Sweet-smelling stuff, Mr. Earp.
Sweet-smelling stuff.
Have a good breakfast?
Yeah, stowed away a whole skillet full of ham and eggs. Feel good.
We figured on getting a buckboard and maybe going up to see James.
Good idea.
Thinking I might ride out there later this afternoon myself.
If I wasn't in the territory, I'd swear we were back home on a Sunday morning.
Yeah, with Ma scrubbing our necks to go to camp meeting.
By golly, I'll bet that's what it is. A camp meeting.
Could be.
You know, I swear I can almost smell the honeysuckle blossoms.
That's me.
Barber.
- Morning.
- Morning.
You gentlemen coming to church this morning, I hope.
We're having our first social to raise money to finish the church.
See? It's a camp meeting.
Camp meeting! No such dad-blasted thing! Regular church.
Is that it?
- I wondered what that lumber was for.
- Roof'll be on next week.
I hope you single men will come.
Be awful nice for the dancing.
Yeah, sis here's single.
Dad-blasted good dancer too.
Thank you, ma'am, but my brothers got sort of a job of work to do... and I ought to stay around the place.
Keeping the peace is no whit less important. Get going, sis. Good day.
- Good day.
- Good day.
There's probably a lot of nice people here. We just ain't met them.
Come on, Morg, let's get started.
I'd like to get back for that dancing.
As for you, when Doc finds out you butted him last night... he'll twist that tin badge around your heart.
I'm Chihuahua.
I'm Doc Holliday's girl.
Just wanted to make sure you were packing.
Stop slamming doors! People bellowing, dropping pitchers on the floor...
- I get no rest.
- I'm sorry. You're not mad, are you?
Sure not. What right have I got to be mad with anyone or anything?
She's packing, Doc.
She's leaving town.
Happy. aren't you?
I ain't sad.
Get me a thing of...
Chihuahua, I'm going into
Mexico for a week or 10 days.
- While I'm gone, I want you...
- Take me with you, will you?
Why not?
Why not?
Tell François to fix a bridal breakfast. Flowers, champagne.
You get in your prettiest dress.
Tell him the queen is dead.
Long live the queen.
Oh, Doc!
- Morning, Miss Carter.
- Good morning, Mr. Earp.
You leaving?
Yes, I'm leaving for the East on the stage.
The eastbound stage don't leave till noon on Sunday.
It's a mighty short visit.
Some people think I've overstayed my visit already.
I don't know, ma'am.
But if you ask me, I think you're giving up too easy.
Marshal, if you ask me...
I don't think you know much about a woman's pride.
No, ma'am, maybe I don't.
Girls, don't forget to be back in time for Sunday dinner, now.
I'm sorry about your bags.
I didn't get them down.
- The girls put together a lunch.
- Well, bless my soul. He did it.
Good morning, miss. Marshal.
John Simpson said he'd have a church and he has. Church bells in Tombstone.
I believe that's the first church bell I've heard in months.
Yes.
Well...
I love your town in the morning, marshal.
The air is so clean and clear.
The scent of the desert flowers.
That's me.
- Barber.
- Oh.
Marshal, may I go with you?
You are going to the services, aren't you?
Yes, ma'am.
- I'd admire to take you.
- Thank you.
Now, folks, I hereby declare the first church of Tombstone... which ain't got no name yet, nor no preacher either... officially dedicated.
Now I don't pretend to be no preacher... but I've read the Good Book from cover to cover and back again... and I nary found one word against dancing.
So we'll commence by having a dad-blasted good dance.
- Will you oblige me, ma'am?
- Thank you.
Hold it, folks.
Dag-blast it, hold it!
Sashay back and make room for our new marshal and his lady fair.
Well, by gollies!
Marshal, I hope you're as good a dad-blasted carver... as you are a dad-blasted good dancer.
Oh, you know...
Pardon me for intruding on your dinner party, marshal.
That's all right. Sit and join us.
Clem, I told you last night to leave Tombstone and go back East.
I also told you if you didn't leave, I would.
He)', Doc!
That's the second time in three days... you've been trying to run somebody out of town.
That's my business.
That's what I'm paid for.
Miss Carter or any other decent citizen can stay here as long as they want to.
We're through talking. My advice to you is, start carrying your gun.
That's good advice.
Doc's gone.
He's left town. He was going to
Mexico and take me with him.
He was gonna marry me.
Well, you're leaving too!
- What's the matter?
- It's just a common case of hysteria.
Oh, it is, is it?
- What're you doing?
- None of your business.
- Behave yourself. Get out.
- I won't get out till she leaves town.
Do you want me to spank you?
Take your hands off me.
Leave me alone!
What do you know? What do you know about Doc and me?
We was going to Mexico to get married.
Yes, he was gonna marry me.
Until this Miss Milkface comes pussyfooting along and...
Where'd you get that?
- Doc. Where do you think I got it?
- You ain't lying?
Why should I lie? He gives me everything
I've got. I've got a roomful of stuff.
Keep your door locked, Miss Carter.
See that this wildcat stays in her room and tell Virg to stay.
What's up?
Doc Holliday.
- Where's Holliday?
- He came in about a half-hour ago.
Got his saddlebag and a sack of gold out of the safe and left in a hurry.
- Were you looking for Doc?
- I am.
Well, he left on the bullion stage, riding shotgun.
- Left town?
- For Tucson.
Get my bay mare up to the jail, will you, Jess?
Sure.
You! Whiskey for my boys.
I think the Huachuca Pass is your best bet, Wyatt. Good luck.
Thank you, Jess.
How long ago did the stage come through?
- About 15, 20 minutes.
- Doc Holliday on it?
Yes, and he was sure going to town.
I need fresh horses.
Cut me out two, Joe.
- One that'll lead well.
- All right, marshal.
That bay looks good.
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey!
Pull up!
Whoa, whoa! Easy. Whoa!
I told you I'm through talking, marshal.
You're coming back to
Tombstone with me, Doc.
Sorry, I'm not going back.
Well, in that case, I'll be taking you back.
Go for your gun, marshal.
You call it, Doc.
- Who is it?
- The marshal.
Why don't you go chase yourself up an alley?
Who do you think you are?
- Chihuahua, open this door.
- Doc? Is that you, Doc?
- I said, open this door.
- Yeah, Doc. Just a minute.
Chihuahua!
- Yes, Doc.
- Open this door before I kick it down!
Yeah, Doc, let me get something on.
Well, hurry up!
Chihuahua!
Come in, Doc.
Chihuahua, why did you tell the marshal I gave you this jewelry?
Well, you did, Doc.
You gave it to me.
I never saw this piece of junk in my whole life. Who gave it to you?
You can't remember everything you give me.
- Sure you did. Don't you remember?
- When?
Two or three days ago. I don't know.
What difference does it make?
That being the case, I charge you with the murder of my brother, James Earp.
- He's fooling.
- I ain't fooling.
It was stolen from him the night he was shot in the back.
Now do you still insist
I gave it to you?
- No, no, of course not.
- Then who did?
- I ain't gonna be a squealer, Doc.
- Let's go, Doc.
Well, you told me to go away and squall my silly little songs somewhere else.
So I came up here and had a good cry.
There was a knock at the door and...
I thought it was you.
I opened the door and... it was Billy Clanton.
Billy Clanton! Go get him, Virg.
- What's happened?
- There's been a shooting. Stay outside.
Quiet!
She's badly hurt.
Mayor, you'd better send to
Huachuca for an army doctor.
- We have to operate immediately.
- That'll take five or six hours, Doc.
You're a doctor, ain't you?
Doctor!
Morg, go get Miss
Carter. She's a nurse.
Tell her to stop by Doc's and get the doctor's bag.
Mac! You and Buck go clean the saloon.
Put two poker tables together and put lights around them.
Sure.
Doc, you're gonna operate.
- Drop her feet, Kirby. Drop her feet.
- Hurry, Doc.
Mac, the light. Over here.
Doc's here, honey. Oh, she's been right brave.
Sorry, Doc.
Still mad?
No, honey.
Look. I haven't got anything to put you to sleep... so this is going to hurt like blazes.
Yell, scream, holler.
Anything you like.
Tell me when you're ready.
Bite on it. Bite hard.
Oh. Oh, Ma!
There, there, honey,
Doc's going to help you.
I'm looking for your brother, Billy Clanton.
He's right in there, Mr. Earp.
My boy Billy.
Shot down on the streets of Tombstone.
Murdered.
It's too bad it had to end this way, Mr. Clanton.
Get mounted.
Hi, Doc.
You're all right.
You've been a brave girl.
All right, lift her up gently please.
Doc... I mean, doctor,
I'm gonna take her to my house and take good care of her.
Can't I do that, marshal?
Sure.
Dr. Holliday.
Thanks.
I'm awfully proud of you, John.
Thanks, Clem. She was a brave girl.
Mac, you ever been in love?
No, I've been a bartender all my life.
We'll be waiting for you, marshal, at the O.K. Corral.
Marshal!
Well, the Clantons are at the O.K. Corral all right.
They're barricaded down there.
We want you to count us in on this.
We ain't fighting men, but we sure like to help you out.
Thanks, deacon, but this is strictly a family affair.
What's the matter? They too yellow to come fight?
They'll come.
Easy on that keg, son.
How's Chihuahua?
She's dead.
"Doctor" John Holliday!
When do we start?
Sunup.
Sun up, Ike! Phin! Sam!
Sun's coming up, marshal.
- Now, got everything straight?
- Yeah.
Let's go.
Here they come!
Doc Holliday's with them.
Wait till they get closer, you fools.
Phin, cover your brother.
Morning, Mr. Clanton.
- Let's talk a while.
- Ike!
Well, now.
You go right ahead and talk.
I got a warrant here for you and your sons.
Charging the murder of
James and Virgil Earp.
There's also a charge of cattle-rustling.
I'm giving you a chance to submit to proper authority.
Well, you come on right in here, marshal, and serve your warrant.
Which one of you killed James?
I did. And the other one too.
Then I'm gonna kill you.
Throw your gun down and come on out, old man.
My boys. Ike. Sam. Phin. Billy!
They're dead.
I ain't gonna kill you.
I hope you live a hundred years.
Feel just a little what my pa's gonna feel.
Now get out of town.
Start wandering.
Wyatt.
- Doc?
- Yeah.
Goodbye, ma'am. Mighty nice to have made your acquaintance.
Get along, horses.
There's so many things
I wanted to say and... now nothing seems appropriate.
Yes, ma'am, I...
Yeah, I know.
The mayor says you might be staying here a while.
Maybe helping get a school started.
Yes, I'm the new schoolmarm.
Well, that's mighty nice, ma'am.
Me and Morg are going out to see Pa. Tell him what happened.
I might come East again.
Get some cattle.
Maybe stop by here again.
Stop by the schoolhouse?
Yes, ma'am, I sure will.
- Goodbye, ma'am.
- Goodbye.
Ma'am, I sure like that name.
Clementine.
Ramrod
Mr. Dickason, your daughter is with him.
-You'll be around, won't you?
-Sure
...I'll be around.
Thanks.
Hello, son...
Hello, sherrif.
You weren't quite so steady on your fins the last time I saw you.
Took me about a week to rope that hangover.
Speaking of drinks, I owe you one.
Alright...
Back for more punishment, I see...
Two.
I've turned over a new leaf since the sherrif got me a job.
Is Shipley really leaving on the stage tonight?
So he says.
Seen Ivey around?
-No.
He plays his cards smart.
Any chance of getting Connie out of town?
No.
A dangerous set-up... you stay out of it.
I work for Walt.
For three weeks? What do you owe that fool? Your life?
Maybe.
Thanks for the drink, son.
Make it two.
Hey, Dave...
Where you been?
I though you'd run out
-No.
Dave.... If our plan works, you'll be the foreman.
The ramrod of the whole outfit.
Ivey's not here. He won't be either.
You think he'll show?
Yeah.
-What makes you so sure?
Frank Ivey
Connie wants to see you... upstairs.
Why?
She's got a notion I'll need help.
Come in.
Sit down.
-Walt said you wanted me.
Yes.
Walt thinks Ivey's only bluffing...
...they won't stop him from taking the stage. -But you think he meant it.
My own father's with Ivey against the man I'm going to marry.
Don't you understand what I'm up against?
Yes, ma'am.
The valley is public grazing land.
Walt has as much right there as anyone.
But he threatened to bring in sheep.
This is cattle country.
You know how sheep ruin a country for cattle
How many men will be there when the stage comes?  -I don't know.
You saw you father and his hands at the blacksmith shop.
I told Dad if his men step in, I'll never set foot in his house again.
There's still Frank Ivey.
Will you stick by Walt?
He helped me when I needed it.
Thanks.
What if Walt takes the stage?
He does bring in sheep?
He won't even bring them in...
If he makes the stage tonight, he'll control the valley.
Goodnight Ms. Connie.
-Wait!
I'll go downstairs with you.
No, you won't.
The whole town knows Ivey wanted to marry you.
If you're there, they'll say he's hiding behind your skirt.
That's one sure way of ruining it.
This is Shipley's bag.
-Stage ready! Get aboard!
Made up your mind, sheep-man?
I'm going.
Are you?
I see you, drunk.
-Listen Ivey...
You're not god. You can't keep a man off a stage.
Throw down his valise, Harry.
He's not going.
Is that you, Dave?
It's your father, Connie.
I've come to take you home.
-I suppose Ivey sent you.
-No
I just thought, on account of tonight, you might want to come home.
Connie, are you hurt about
Walt throwing you over?
You have such a thoughtful way of putting it.
Walt didn't throw me over.
He just decided he didn't love me enough to die for me.
-Now...
-It's the truth!
He gave you a wonderful excuse with his threat of sheep.
Now you and Frank are right back where you started, hoping I'll be impressed.
Well, I'm not and I'm clearing out!
I don't understand you.
At first, I thought you were just headstrong.
When you were little, I'd get a kick out of seeing you stand up and fight.
But...
Tonight, men could have been killed because of you.
Could have... but they weren't.
From now on, I'm gonna make a life of my own.
And being a woman, I won't have to use guns.
There's something else...
This isn't just a fight between father and daughter.
You've pushed Ivey on me since I can remember.
For years, I've watched him run things.
The town, the valley, you, now me!
No ones ever had the nerve to stand up to him. Well, I have!
I'm warning you, don't get in my way! And that goes for Ivey!
Now, get out!
Get out!
-Evening, Rose.
-Come on in, Dave.
Have you eaten?
-Yes.
Come on, we'll have a cup of coffee.
I heard what happened.
What are you going to do now?
-Drift.
Where's Bill?
You know Bill.
He'll hang around town for a week, raising cain.
Then, all of a sudden, he's gone.
Present for you.
It's lovely!
It was sweet of you, but...
Martin Bondurant already told his wife about the expensive silks just in.
If I appeared in a dress of the same material...
-I never thought of that.
-Of course.
What's the matter?
Why don't you get it off your chest?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pry.
You're not, Rose.
I lost my wife when our son was born.
He would have been six just three weeks ago.
-Would have been?
-Yeah...
I was buying cattle in a small way and had to travel
So I left him with friends.
While I was gone, their house burned.
He was in it, sleeping.
They died trying to save him.
-Liquor didn't help.
Bill Schell's crazy talk didn't help, either.
It was you, Rose. Putting up with us, cheerful, not asking questions.
That's why I wanted to thank you.
If you don't mind, I'll like to keep this, afterall.
If you don't mind, I think I'll have that supper, afterall.
I thought you would.
-Morning, Ms. Connie.
-Morning.
I suppose you know Walt's gone.
"Connie... This is the kind of a beating I can not take. 
I have signed my ranch over to you. Good Luck, Walt."
Well...
-What did you expect him to do?
-Marry me and stay and fight.
Not stick a note under my door and run.
He just wasn't strong enough, was he?
-No.
Well, I am. Strong enough to be both
Dad and Ivey at their own business.
They broke Walt and I'm going to fight back.
I'll make Circle 66 an outfit they'll respect.
I want you to run it.
No, ma'am.
Why not?
They didn't break Walt. They were just fighting sheep, like any cattleman.
They'd break any man I wanted.
They'd find a reason. Like they made sheep the reason for breaking Walt.
But I'll never turn to Frank Ivey.
A little money of my own. Enough to buy some cattle and hire a crew.
They won't break anybody when
I get through with them.
Connie...
Better let Link drive you home now that your sheep-herder's thrown you over.
Thanks, Link. But I'm not going home.
Walt left me his ranch, and I'm moving in on valley grass. All I can hold.
Wait, you're just excited.  You don't think we'd let you steal our grass.
It's a free range.
I warn you. They'll be gunplay.
Men will get hurt.
Your men, too.  -What's come over you?
You've changed?
You're so hard?
-Coming from you, that's a compliment.
Looks like we won the first round.
-Not we. This is your fight.
You afraid?
When I take the count, it'll be for my own mistakes.
If I can draw my wages, I'm drifting.
-I'll leave it over at the Special Saloon.
You change your mind, come back.
You'll always have a job as long as I have a ranch.
Thanks.
Howdy, Dave...
Ms. Dickason sent this over for ya.
Hello, Jim...
-I hear your boss ran out on ya.
Now you'll have to get a new sucker to pay for your drinks, boozehead.
I'd go careful, Red.
Sounds like Shipley, don't he?
He just talked.
So do you.
That's enough!
-A man would never do that to me.
-Or me.
Too bad you joined up with the wrong outfit. Now, you're drifiting
-Am I?
-Yeah
When I'm ready.
I warned you it was a tough set-up.
I didn't stay out of it.
Well, there are other places.
You, too?
Sometimes it's hard to choose between friendship and duty.
And you've been sherrif a long time.
Hello, Dave.
-How many hands you think you'll need?
-All you can get.
Afraid that won't be many. Ivey scared all the spare hands out of the valley.
There's one I think I can get.
He may know of others.
Stick close by the house
'till I get back.
Howdy.
I'm looking for Bill Schell.
Have you seen him?
Nope.
I'll have a look around.
Go ahead.
Thanks.
How are you kid?
It's alright. He's a friend of mine.
You look fine, kid.
Why'd you wanna go to work for?
I miss you.
How's Rose?
She's fine.
You on the dodge?
I kissed a fella's girl last night.
George thought you'd might be him.
-How'd you like to go to work?
-Work? What for?
I still got some money.
How do you stack up with Frank Ivey?
I worry him. I have too much fun to suit him.
I don't like him either. He makes too big of tracks.
Walt Shipley gave Connie Dickason his ranch last night.
She's out to get Ben and Frank.
I'm hiring an outfit.
You're not like me, kid. You don't fight for pay.
Ivey ordered me out of town.
Count me in.
Under my orders, Bill.
That's the way it's gotta be, or don't take the job.  -Sure.
That's the way it'll be, kid.
We oughta have three or four more men.
I can get fifty men to work for nothing. Just for one crack at Ivey.
Want 'em with grudges?
-I don't care.
But they've gotta pass with Jim Crew.
Jim Crew? What's he gotta do with it?
The sheriff's on blue chip. Anything we do against Ivey has to be legal.
It's a deal.
Where's Ms. Connie?
Ms. Connie went back home to get her trunk. Then this happened.
Who did it?
We know who did it. I said before,
Frank Ivey leaves pretty big tracks.
-None we can show the sherrif.
-Who cares? We know who we're fighting!
Now's the time to take him apart.
I give the orders around here and we're playing this on the square. Remember?
Alright... Alright, kid.
You're the ramrod of this outfit.
Wait here until I get back.
If you're so set on a running a ranch, you can have mine.
Anytime you want it
-You and I would get along a lot better...
...if you pulled back to your side of American Creek.
And let you grab half the grass?
What if I won't?
-Then, I'll have to take it.
That kind of fight is supposed to be from men. Think you're tough enough.
-She thinks Dave Nash is pretty tough.
-He'll be drunk when she needs him.
That's my risk.
You've heard my proposition.
Do I get the grass or not?
I said I'd stick by whatever
Frank says.
I've been doing it so long, it's gotten to be a habit.
-Ms. Connie here?
-Yes, she is.
-How's your nose, Red?
-Don't worry. I can still smell with it.
Right now, I'm sorry.
Come in, Dave.
-No, thanks.
-Hello, Dave.
I came to help you.
Thank you. That's sweet of you.
-How's everything at the Circle 66?
-Just fine.
Everything's cozy and warm.
You still insist on leaving, huh?
Just what do you expect to get out of this?
Wages.
And something Shipley said got me curious.  -What was that?
He said Ivey wasn't God.
Ivey says he is.
I want to see who's right.
I'll wait for you outside, Ms. Connie.
What'll we do, Dave? We can't hold a crew together without even a house.
Sorry. It's my fault.
You told me not to leave the house.
Ivey's got a line camp near here.
It's built of stone.
Fireproof.
Hello in there! I can lick anyone in there for a meal and a bit!
Well, if it ain't Bill Schell.
You wouldn't have to ask for a handout if you'd get a job. Come in.
It's an idea.
Morning.
How many hands you got here?
Just us.
Makes it easy.
Come on in, Dave. They're all here.
Come on in.
Got a job, Gus. Forgot to tell you.
Dave, this is Ed Burma.
Ivey's tough ramrod.
I'll remember this, you saddletramp.
Get the buckboard up here.
Come on. Get out.
Come on! Get going, all of you!
Hurry it up.
Virg Lea... Try to hang him, he'd go through the rope.
Jess More... He likes to play "injun".
-We'll be back.
-Anytime.
Ms. Dickason... does your old man know about this?
Tell Ben and Ivey that she'll be glad to trade houses.
Tell him it's for keeps.
-I'll tell him.
A sure sad bunch.
-Where do we put it?
-Oh, anywhere or there.
-After travelling all night,
I'm sure hungry.  -Me, too!
There's plenty of food here for our outfit.
Hey, this ain't bad!
That's going to be just fine, Curley.
-It aint' stylish, like you're used to.
-It'll be alright when it's clean.
Give me a hand, Curley.
-You mean to wash this place?
At least, I can scold a few spiders.
Looks like we're going to have visitors.
Good morning, Connie.
How's my little land-feed?
-I'm not your little anything.
Besides, this land was filed on today.
Seems you neglected that when you built here.  -So I found out.
Very clever of you.
-The cleverness was my foreman's.
-Since we're busy, I'll thank you to get off...  -Your foreman's new to this country.
I wonder who told him I hadn't filed.
Virg, bring Curley over.
We have a legal right to be here.
You can't put us off this land.
Oh, I can't?
I can discourage your men.
Alright, Virg.
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it, I say!
Hold it, Virg!
Take your dirty hands off her.
It's not the camp. It's not Curley.
I'd be through if I let you get away.
Can't play second fiddle anymore than you. We're alike that way.
Nice, Connie. That's the first time you've ever touched me.
Go ahead, Virg!
-Is the doctor here?
-He's out on a call...
Dave!
What happened?
I couldn't stop it.
Two of Ivey's men held him, while
Virg...  -Don't waste time talking.
We've got to get him to bed. Take him to Rose's.
I'll get the doctor.
-Rose...?
-Hurry up, Connie!
Was he dragged by a horse?
No.
I'll relieve you later.
I'm sorry.
Somebody had to cry for him, I guess.
That's you, Rose.
I'll pay Ivey back for this if it's the last thing I do.
Ed Burma's down there. Let's send him back to Ivey in a basket.
-You do, and I ride out.
-They did it to Curley.
-Who you fighting? Ivey or Burma?
-Ivey
Then fight him. Get some sense into that thick, little head of yours.
They want that. We make a wrong move and Crew's on their side.
You won't back up your own men?
It's gotta be my way.
Jim...
Hello, Dave.
I want you to deputize me.
To go after Virg?
Lindstrom and I have already attended to that.
Where is he?
Ben and Ivey's going his bail. Three thousand. Ben's bringing it in.
I'd have done better.
I take my law from the book, Dave.
Virg'll go the pen for this.
And if Curley dies...
-Virg dies!
...but it better be legal. Mind you that.
Hello, Burma.
Heard about Curley?
I had nothing to do with that.
I don't want no trouble, Bill.
You ain't got two men to hold me like they held Curley.
Won't take a chance without them?
If I ever mind to fight, nobody has to hold for me.
What'll take to give you a mind to?
Right now, an awful lot.
I won't be rawhide'd into this.
I ain't gonna draw!
They can all see my hands!
I ain't gonna draw!
Pokey... here.
Buy yourself a bottle and take a vacation far from town. And quick!
Connie!
I heard two shots before
Bill could draw.
There's his gun.
This better be true.
Sure, it's been fired.
What were you doing all this time?
While he was shooting fast, I was aiming careful. Ask George.
-Well, I...
-Sure. And I'll ask Pokey, too...
When we find him.
He sure let out quick.
Guess he was scared.  -Bill ain't the kind to wait two shots before he moves.
How'd he get this burn on his hand?
Bill laid his cigar down. Maybe
Burma put his hand on it.
It happens to be on the back of his hand.
He fell on his back.
It might have been under his hand.
-You two are lying.
George and Bill have been in cahoots for years.
You put Virg on the barn. Why don't you do the same here?
If Curley dies and Burma's been murdered, Bill and Virg will both hang.
I can't hang a man for self-defense.
-Burma's dead...
And all Curley had was a poke in the nose.  -Ben...
I'd like to show you what a poke in the nose can do.
-I don't want to see it.
-Afraid?
Connie saw it.
Lindstrom...
I'd like to take care of Curley.
And pay all his expenses.
Paying his expense won't restore his sight.
I don't want to fight with her, Rose.
She's all I've got.
She's got her pride, Ben. You broke a man in front of her.
You don't know how a woman feels.
You didn't have to let Frank do that.
Maybe, but she couldn't have loved
Walt Shipley. He was trash.
What's Frank Ivey?
The biggest man in the valley.
I get Connie's side of it, but I don't get yours.
Are you after Connie?
We'll just pretend you never asked that.
Hello, Bill.
Hello, Connie. Where is everybody?
Around.
Sure could do with a cup of coffee.
Bill...
Did Burma really draw first?
George said so, didn't he?
-Did he?
-What do you think?
I think you're not afraid to take a chance.
I like that.
What are you after, Con?
Alright. I'll tell you.
I want to break Frank Ivey.
I want to see him crawl out of town the same way Walt did.
If Curley dies...
Dave will take care of Ivey.
Dave's way is too slow.
Just what's on your mind, Connie.
I want you to stampede my herd.
Stampede?
It's the one way to make Dave and Jim Crew more fast.
I've thought about it for a long time.
They'll think Frank Ivey did it.
Yeah.
They might.
They will.
This is something I didn't figure in.
What did you figure?
To tell the truth, I...
Why bother?
C'mon, people... push them on!
Keep 'em moving!
Head 'em for the cliff!
-Hello, Rose.
-Hello, Bill.
-How's Curley?
-I wouldn't go in now. He's asleep.
Wait a little while.
This is nice.
Bill... you've torn your sleeve.
-It's fine
-Give it to me and I'll fix it.
With two women out at the ranch,
I'd think you'd be looked after better.
No one looks after me.
Annie looks after Connie...
And Connie looks after Dave.
Who does Dave look after?
Who do you think?
The cattle.
I wonder what's up.
Ivey and his crew jumped us about midnight.
Set us off of the herd and started shooting.  -Part of them chased us...
...and the others stampeded the whole herd off the cliffs.
So Ivey's really gone wild.
I'd never thought it.
He's always been wild.
Well, I've heard your evidence.
Remember boys, no liquor. We got a big job ahead of us.
Your men ain't going, Dave.
Everyone of them has a grudge against
Ivey, and the law has to be immune.
-But you'll need help, Jim.
-Thanks.
This is my business.
-And it's my fight.
It doesn't call for shooting.
But it might if you were there.
You're probably right.
I know I'm right. This has been my liftetime job, son.
You ever want to quit, I'll give you a job on my outfit.
Even sign you on as ramrod.
At my age, I take that as quite a compliment.
Virg, watch yourself.
Jim Crew's coming.
Hello, Jim.
Glad to see you. You look kind of thirsty.
How about a little drink.
Come here for Virg?
No... I will be soon.
Doc says Curley won't last.
-Found Pokey?
-No, not yet.
Here.
Something wrong, Jim?
You coming?
Coming? Where?
To jail?
Jail? For what?
Stampeding Connie's cattle last night wasn't exactly legal.
What? I wasn't off the place last night and I can prove it. Come here!
Where was I last night, boys?
-Right here.
All night.
He sure was. He won a months wages off of me in the poker game.
You hear that?
Better put your boots on.
I told you I wasn't off the place.
You'll get a chance to prove that before a jury.
You're lying.
I'm not lying when I say I'm taking you in.
I'm warning you, Jim, get away from here.
I'll tell you just once more.
Come along.
Don't do it, Jim!
Red...
-Get over to Dickason's and spread word that Virg shot the sherrif. - Listen...
Shut your mouth! I'll take care of you.
Go on. I want Dave Nash to hear about this.
Virg wasn't the real killer.
He just pulled the trigger.
I killed him.
I killed him by playing safe and using the law as a weapon.
The law was just a tired old man.
Dave!
Don't risk everything now.
Ms. Connie...
I hate to bother you...
...but there's something you oughta know.  -What is it?
I seen what happened.
Your own men stampeded your cattle.
They done it on purpose. I seen them.
But nobody saw me.
-There must be some mistake.
No, ma'am. Tom Peebles, Bailey and Bill Schell... I seen them.
Sit down, Link.
Link...
You know Dad tried to force me to marry Frank Ivey.
That's why I left home.
-So, I heard.
Frank fights dirty... and I've got to fight the same way.
Curley's dying because of him.
I know Bill Schell stampeded the cattle.
The orders were mine.
But... on account of that, Jim
Crew is dead.
I know.
It's a terrible thing to have on my conscience.
I didn't know this was going to happen.
Should I take all the blame.
Oh, no. Don't tell them nothing.
And you don't have to worry about me,
Ms. Connie. I'll keep my mouth shut.
Thanks, Link.
Dave...
Frank Ivey killed the sherrif.
Dave...
Dave!
You'll have to help me, Rose.
Where's Curley?
Died this afternoon.
-Fine!  -I'll find him. Bailey and Peebles, too.
Why don't you look in Idaho or Montana?
They quit after Crew was killed.
C'mon, Nash is wounded. He can't get far.
Head back to town!
-Out in the open, ain't it?
Why not? I'm in it, too.
Didn't they stampede those cattle and try to hang it on me.
-Bill.
-Hello, Rose. How is he?
I found out there's no passengers on the stage. It's our only chance.
They just been through our house.
Thank heavens Doc wasn't home.
Here they are.
You two women go out the back way and quick.
Where's my gun?  -You two get out of here!  -I have an idea.
It's you. Well, I'm busy.
We won't be long. Take a look in the kitchen.
Just looking around.  -Look somewhere else. Not here. I won't stand it!
What's the matter with you?
-I want Dave Nash, that's all.
I haven't seen him. And if I had,
I wouldn't tell you.
Now, get out. Both of you.
-Not until I've found Dave Nash.
Nothing in the kitchen.
He isn't here!
-We'll see.
You're not going in. Mrs. Parks is in for a fitting.  -I'll look anyways.
-You're not coming in! I'm undressed!
-I'm sorry. They forced their way in.
-Better put some clothes on. I'm coming in.  -I'm not dressing for your sake!
You think you can run this town?
Here's one person you can't run!
I know enough about this town to know you've done one thing too many.
I never did think decency meant anything... You listen!
They just brought in Pokey. He says
Bill rawhide'd Burma into that fight.
Bill Schell's dead. He may not know it, but he is.
I have some business. When I get back, that fitting better be over.
My fitting will be over when we get things right and not before.
Bill Schell, turn your back!
Hey Pop, c'mon, we're going.
That's the first time you ever let a woman bluff you out...
...cause she didn't have clothes on.
She wouldn't have taken them off if Dave was there.
Dave, listen...
You remember what we told you?
You know what you've got to do?
C'mon...
You wait here.
C'mon...
-Ready to roll, Joe?
-Ready to roll, Harry.
Wait!
-Is that all tonight?
-That's all.
Hey there, Harry!
I'm looking for Dave Nash.
-Haven't seen him.
If you do see him out on the road, come back and let me know.  -I will.
-Go back to the house, honey.
I gotta get moving.  -Bill!
Yes?
Thank you.
I better go.
I gotta beat Dave through the leaf.
-What's the matter, Bill?
-Alright, kid...
I'd have taken it easier had
I known Dave was inside.
Where you hiding him, Bill?
You're a friend of mine, but not that good of friend. Another thing...
If Frank Ivey hears of this,
I'm gonna kill you! Dead!
-Don't worry. He won't.
-I said "dead"!
Keep the bandages and medicine separate. And see that he's warm.
-Morning, Rose.
-Morning.
Good morning, Ms. Connie.
-I'd like to talk to you?
-We'll go in the living room.
Sit down, Connie.
Frank Ivey was at my place, yesterday. Looking for Dave.
He's been hurt.
I waited, but he didn't come home.
-You've seen him.
-Yes.
Bill's hiding him.
-How is he?
-Weak?
All he needs is rest and quiet.
Why didn't you send word to me?
You don't like me, do you?
I used to pity you, Connie.
You got a rough deal from Frank and Ben.
But your fight is costing too many lives.
It's not worth it.
-Isn't it?
Not if Frank gets Dave.
He's the only thing that matters to me.
It happens I feel the same way, too.
-Not the same, Connie.
You want him along with revenge and power.
You're letting him break himself on your greed and ambition.
-You told him that, I suppose.
-You don't tell a man about a woman.
You have to find that out for himself.
Where is he?
Frank Ivey will be watching all of us. Especially you.
The only way you can get to Dave is by following someone who goes to him.
You'll never find out from me where he is.
Wow how. Good morning.
Sure take a lot of killing, kid.
You still hungry?
What good does it do me?
Any salt left?
-No.
But Rose is sending up some more grub.
Some day, a man is gonna stop her from taking in strays.  -Like us.
Yeah. Guess she won't know what to do.
-Has she got a man?  -She can take me right off the Christmas tree anyday.
But she knows I'm a drifter.
Jim Crew always said that no one ever fools with Rose very much.
Just can't figure it out. I mean
Ivey cutting loose his dogs.
He was playing for Crew, same as we were.
Well, he probably got a wild streak.
No, things just don't fit. He knows a stampede would bring Crew down on him.
If he wanted to kill him, there are easier ways.
Well, he did and that's enough.
We're licked.
No.
There's just one load and a gun between
Connie and what she wants.
The load that gets Ivey.
Not mine. I've seen Ivey work.
Anyway...
...when you're heading to ride out of here...
...it's over the hill for me.
How about you?
I'll stay.
What is it? Connie?
-I don't know.
-Listen, kid.
Frank got shot at once for hugging a gal.
Connie will get you killed just working for her.
You better sleep on it, kid.
-Like just one horse.
-Probably, George.
I'll take a look.
Why'd you come here? Didn't
Rose tell you you'd be followed?
I didn't know if Dave was dead or alive. What was I suppose to do?
Wait. Same thing Rose is doing.
I was careful.
I wasn't followed.
Does Dave know the truth about the stampede?
Not from me.
I feel the way you must feel about killing Ed Burma.
You don't know. You're just guessing.
I know.
That's your secret, Bill.
The stampede's mine.
Sounds like a deal.
It is.
Happy now? Ivey's after us.
I heard the shot.
How do you feel?  -I'll be alright when I get to saddle.
That's Connie's horse.
-Sure. And you're taking it.
You're riding south, alone. Connie, you take my horse.  -Why?
Look, kid. They followed Connie's horse here. They know its tracks.
Ivey doesn't want her.
-What about you two?
-We're heading north.
They'll think it's you and me they're trailing. Then, for a while...
...Connie will head back to town.
Then they'll chase me.
-I won't let you do that.  -Don't argue!
I can hold them off for a whole day.
They'll be out of the country by then.
Good luck, kid.
There's just one more thing.
Connie, I want you to hear this, too.
I braced Ed Burma, and got him cold.
I ain't sorry.
I figured you did.
I came up here to help you.
But all I've done is put them all on your trail.
You would have to come sometime. All
I'll remember is that you did come.
I'll be waiting for you. Hope you come back.
I will. I promise.
Connie...
You wanna be sure and get him killed, just keep on talking.
There it is, Connie. Head for Signal.
-You heading for the Pass?
-No. Ivey knows we were at the mine.
He'll have the pass blocked.
They'll corner you up there.
Yeah.
But it'll take them plenty of time.
And Dave needs that.
Thanks to you.  -Haven't much for me, have you?
You're like a horse or dog, or a man or any other woman...
Once I understand you, you're alright.
They stop you and you tell them you're riding with me, they won't believe it.
Well, they parted here.
That goes back to town.
Nash wouldn't take that.
You two better follow it anyways.
C'mon with us, Pop.
He must want to get himself shot, taking this trail.
We'll accomodate him.
He'll never get out of there.
Alright, let's get her over.
Hold it!
Keep covered.
We got plenty of time.
We'll wait.
You'll have to get mighty close for that thing.
I'll get close.
Pop, take the ridge. You take the collapsed side.
Ben...
You'll have to stake me to a fresh horse and some grub. 
You think you're fit to go on?
Link! Link!
Sit down. I'll get you some water.
They got me on the run, Ben. They'll be beating the brush for me.
I know. They are now.
Link!
Get him a fresh horse.
-Right away, Mr. Dickason.
Ivey shouldn't have got
Bill Schell that way.
How?
A shotgun in the back.
Dave...
Ms. Connie isn't blaming me, is she?
I haven't told a soul. Not even Mr. Dickason.
Tired, son? You'll have to talk plainly.
Ivey didn't find out from me.
Maybe Bill Schell told him.
Told him what?
Don't treat me like I was four years old.
When I told Ms. Connie I seen it, she admitted giving the orders.
Orders for what, Link?
For her own men to stampede her cattle out of the country.
Listen, Frank. We've been riding for two nights. We're all dead for sleep.
Go get some.
Keep out of this.
You gotta get awful close with that.
But you won't.
Dave!
I'm alright.
It might have been you lying there.
But it isn't.
-No.
This is the way it was meant to be.
It's all over now.
You've got what you wanted.
-What we wanted!
You and I.
All this is ours now for the rest of our lives.
Don't you see what we've won, Dave?
Can't you hear what I'm saying?
I'm thinking of Jim Crew and Bill Schell.
That couldn't be helped.
Link told me about the stampede.
Would it make any difference if I said I was sorry?
Terribly sorry.
Funny how people fall back on those words. "I'm sorry".
What counts now is our happiness.
Our freedom. The way we want to live.
Not we, Connie.
Just you. Alone.
But we don't want it alone.
So you don't want it alone?
I guess that squares everything.
Dave...
It sure is a pretty dress.
You like it?
Yeah.
Would it do for a wedding dress?
NARRATOR:
At the forks of the Ohio stands an American city, a colossus of steel, whose mills and furnaces bring forth bone and sinew for a nation.
Not so long ago a lonely outpost guarded this very spot.
It was called Fort Pitt.
It stood at the edge of an unknown land, one of a line of forts that ran from Virginia to the Great Lakes, marking the end of the known and the beginning of the unknown.
Civilization was east of the Allegheny Mountains.
Conquest, opportunity and death lay to the west.
All around Fort Pitt was a vast forest, always beautiful, always dangerous.
Men came into it seeking many things.
Some for wealth, some for refuge some for freedom.
But to the Indian, all men came as invaders.
Wars for survival between red men and white threatened to sweep away these little forts.
Yet men kept coming west.
Some to build their own fortunes, even at the price of Indian wars.
Others to build a nation, even at the price of their own lives.
These are the unconquered, who push ever forward the frontiers of man's freedom.
But history sometimes chooses its heroes and heroines from strange places.
For one, the hope of freedom was born at Old Bailey in London, in the year 1763.
Prisoner at the bar.
You have been found guilty of the most heinous crime, of murder.
It is my duty to pass upon you the sentence which the law enjoins.
Abigail Martha Hale, the sentence of this court is...
My lord.
Woman, be still.
My lord, hear me.
My brother was ill of fever when the press-gang broke in to take him.
I helped him fight to be free.
In that fight, an impressing officer of the Royal Navy was killed.
My brother was killed too, my lord.
The prisoner is here to receive sentence.
The sentence of this court is that you be taken from this place to a lawful prison and thence to a place of execution.
And that you there be hanged by the neck until you are dead.
And may the Lord have mercy on your soul.
Come.
One word more, by the gracious generosity of Our Sovereign Lord,
King George the Third, it is in my power to offer you the King's mercy.
Instead of execution, you may be transported to His Majesty's colonies in North America.
Not to die, my lord?
And to serve not less than 14 years as an indentured slave, to be sold at auction to the highest bidder.
Slavery in the colonies or the gallows here.
Speak up, girl, which is it to be?
Slavery, my lord.
Get the blood in your cheeks.
You'll fetch a better price at Norfolk tomorrow.
Mr. Leach, you won't sell me away from my husband, will you?
You'll sell according to your indentures.
Seven year, l'll be free and get me a bit of land.
And maybe even a strong wife.
LEACH: Get along, get along.
Me, l'll get me bought by a nice rich widow and marry myself free.
I ain't a rich widow, but l'm willing.
Ain't you got a wife already, Tom?
Wife. I'm serving time for all four of them.
Break your ranks and save your shanks.
Our land of opportunity.
Jeremy, how old shall l look in 14 years?
Fourteen years older, of course.
LEACH: Here, here, have a care there.
Have a care.
MAN: Hold onto the slate.
MAN 2: Make fast to the pin rail.
MAN 3: Ease that on the deck.
And at ease.
Some sort of chopping instrument.
LEACH: Stand by your braces.
Let go of the last one.
Jeremy, put it back before the owner sees you.
GARTH: The owner has seen you.
Hand me that tomahawk.
Tomahawk?
I was just remarking to this young lady...
Convicts should know the punishment for stealing.
Captain.
Well, he didn't steal it.
No, well, perhaps...
Who are you?
My daughter, sir.
The devoted daughter of Jeremy John Love.
Jeremy, l'm not your daughter.
No, not in fact, but in spirit.
You seem a gentleman of discernment, sir.
Tell me, can you always spot the queen?
I believe so.
Excellent, I've heard...
No, no.
Don't go away, my dear.
Jeremy, please.
You show a taste for entertainment, sir, entertainment with a dash of risk.
Well?
Well, sir, observe your queen is now between two knaves, thus.
But can you tell me where the queen is hiding now?
And if l do?
The stake is yours to name, sir.
A pound.
A pound it is.
Put it up.
Oh, well, l seldom carry large sums of money upon my...
You have other assets.
Perhaps a kiss from your daughter-in-spirit.
Jeremy, l won't be...
Keep your hair on, he can't win.
MAN: Man the mizzen top-sail sheets.
A golden sovereign.
Gallant risk, sir.
Now, sir.
Now, can you tell me where the queen is hiding?
Yes. Up the sleeve of a cheat who is about to get 30 lashes.
Thirty?
You wouldn't have a man of his age whipped.
His age hasn't improved his honesty or yours.
Slave driver.
Wait.
I'll give you the kiss.
You're not giving it, l won it.
MAN: He's got her anchored all right.
Another cheat.
I paid you.
You can do better.
Slave driver.
Yes.
Yes, Mr. Garth.
This woman for sale?
Yes, Mr. Garth.
They're all for sale.
Indentured servant?
No, sir. Felon.
Felon?
It ain't deep in her character, Mr. Garth.
She's good manners, gentle, sweet.
Fit for all kinds of housework.
I'll buy her.
I won't be sold to this man.
What's her price?
Mr. Leach, the judge said public auction.
LEACH: Hold your tongue.
She's right.
We'll have an auction right here.
Gentlemen, would any of you care to bid against me for his girl?
MAN: Not me.
I don't hold much with slavery.
That red hair could change a man's mind.
I'm starting at £20.
£20 is bid for
Abigail Martha Hale.
Offering 14 years of servitude.
Let them see your face, girl.
Going once, going twice.
For the third and last time...
HOLDEN: And sixpence.
FERGUS: Pardon?
Man, you've an eye like an eagle.
But l dinnae ken your way of throwing.
Did you say something, sir?
Yes, l said, "And sixpence."
Lend me your bodkin, Fergus.
It's an Indian knife throw.
Captain Holden has a reputation for joking.
Make your sale.
Oh, yes, sir.
Yes, sir, Mr. Garth.
Going to Mr. Garth for...
You heard my bid?
LEACH: Yes, sir,
£20 and sixpence.
Would your humor desert you,
Captain Holden, at £50?
MAN 1: £50, did you hear that?
MAN 2: What do you know!
£50 for this likely servant maid.
Strong and willing.
Do l hear another bid?
And sixpence.
LEACH: And sixpence.
£50 and sixpence.
LEACH: Do l hear £55?
Cash on the barrel.
Cash on the barrel.
Try another.
£50 and sixpence, l'm bid.
And sixpence.
£60 and sixpence...
That's better.
He must be very rich or very interested.
He hasn't even looked at me.
£60 and sixpence for this rare gem.
Smile, you little scut.
Do l hear another bid?
GARTH: Yes.
And sixpence.
LEACH: It's £65 and sixpence.
Hey, Chris, the game's getting a wee bit rough.
Here's your coat.
Do l hear £70? You will not see the likes of this maid in all His Majesty's colonies.
You seem to want this girl.
The Ohio country won't be a healthy place for a white woman when the Indians get these toys you're bringing them.
Usual trade goods.
Usual?
What you've got aboard the brig Minerva and the ship Paragon?
It might pay you to mind your own business.
I found that out from one of your Senecas on the Catawba Trail.
You met one of the bad shots.
That one will never learn to shoot any better.
And sixpence.
I hear £70 and another sixpence.
Have a closer look, gentlemen.
Skin soft as satin.
Cheerful as a meadowlark.
MAN 1: Muskets.
MAN 2: That's guns in there.
They're all new.
Even this ship is loaded with your usual trade goods.
Indians don't trade furs for Bibles.
They don't trade for bond slaves, either.
What are your plans for her?
Field hand on your plantation?
I apologize for Mr. Garth, ma'am.
In Virginia we use dirt to grow tobacco and bury our dead.
We don't like your kind of dirt, Mr. Garth.
MAN 3: Watch out.
No, gentlemen, no.
Not on my ship.
You are quite right,
Captain Brooks.
His purse.
Perhaps someday he'll come west of the Alleghenies.
Dueling code is very different in the Ohio country.
£70 and sixpence is bid, gentlemen, for this dainty little package.
Look at her slender form, the tilt of her head.
You, sir, would you care to put in a bid, sir?
No, thank you.
I've never had to buy trouble.
Here's my bid,
£103. A Turk's ransom.
Jeremy, l'm frightened.
A hundred quid would frighten the wings off an angel.
And sixpence.
I'll double that tomorrow at Norfolk.
Cash on the barrel, Mr. Garth.
Is that yours?
No, mine's in the Captain's strongbox.
He's right. Cash is the law.
Make the sale.
£103 and sixpence, once, twice.
Sold to Captain Holden for £103...
And sixpence.
Sorry, Mr. Garth.
Quite a price for a rose of Old Bailey.
Here's your bonnet.
Have the bill of sale ready in the morning.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
My dear Captain, allow me to present my ward.
I hope you had a very pleasant voyage, ma'am.
Well...
Chris...
Chris, a loony man would seem wise alongside of you.
Why did ye do it?
Garth is bad medicine,
Fergus.
She'll be safer with him than with your promised bride tomorrow when she sees yon red-headed purchase you just made.
Aye. Diana.
MAN: Land ho!
MAN 1: Haul away on the...
MAN 2: Clear tire.
Clear tire.
Your longboat's making fast, sir.
Does it carry a young lady armed with a musket?
The ship's agent brought this aboard, sir.
Thank you.
Oh, will you have my luggage lowered to the longboat?
Certainly, sir.
From the impatient bride?
No, from John Fraser.
Pittsburgh blacksmith.
Pittsburgh?
Little village in Virginia.
Listen to this.
"Trouble's busting everywhere.
"When you get yours, if you ain't killed nobody,
"meet me at the Peakestown Fair."
John must have dipped his pen in applejack.
He can't have known you're getting married.
If you'll sign
Mistress Hale's papers, sir.
Whose? Oh.
Have the notary certify these, then give them to the girl.
Yes, sir. She's on deck.
If he likes sugarplums, you look just like one.
He's probably married, with six children.
Stop babbling.
Just get him to buy me and l'll have you riding in your own carriage.
Love accomplishes all things, my dear.
For instance, for luck.
Jeremy, it's a gold piece.
Uh-huh.
King Charles double guinea.
It was given to my mother by a prince of the blood.
There he is.
Well, go to him. Go to him.
Keep your gold in your fist, your tongue in your cheek, and don't be too forward, and not too backward, either.
MAN: Pick up, you're slacking that line.
Good morning, Captain Holden.
Good morning, Miss...
Well, l'm all ready.
Yes. I see you are.
Bend your bonnets.
Do we go now?
I'm sorry, Miss...
Abby.
Miss Abby.
But l'm not taking you.
You're free.
But didn't you buy me?
Oh, yes, l bought you...
MAN: Watch yourself.
Stand clear, you.
And now l've set you free.
ABBY: You mean really free?
HOLDEN: Yes. Leach will give you your papers.
I'm very grateful, but l won't accept my freedom.
You won't?
I owe you £103 and sixpence and l intend to work for you until it's paid.
Oh, not for me.
You're much too pretty to pass the porridge on my honeymoon.
Your honeymoon? But...
You're married?
I will be within the week.
Goodbye, Abby.
Then why did you buy me?
What?
Why did you buy me?
Oh, to see if sixpence could poison a snake.
Oh. You bought me because you don't like him.
Well, here's a lucky piece to brighten your opinion of me.
It's a King Charles double guinea.
What did l do with it?
Oh, l see.
I didn't steal it.
I see your hand was quicker than my eye.
Keep it.
More freight for the longboat.
MAN: Aye, aye, sir.
Hold tight.
Take it easy, men.
You've got a passenger on it.
Easy on that cargo sling.
Keep it clear of the shroud.
Chris.
HOLDEN: No.
Doesn't look like it to me.
DIANA:
Who's the girl with him?
Don't know. Very pretty.
MAN 1: Flip the toddle.
Clear that gear.
MAN 2: On deck.
Overhaul the cabling.
Batten the hooks down.
Pull the hatch ladder.
Watch your footing on the gangway.
There's Martha.
There she is.
Goodbye, George.
See you in Jamestown.
Land never looked better.
WOMAN: I'm so glad to be home, l could walk on air.
Hello, Bone.
I'll sign these later.
Very good, sir.
What'd you bring from Pittsburgh?
Two wagons of this kind of stuff.
Injuns ain't hunting.
What's wrong?
Gun trading's been stopped.
Who stopped it?
Indian Commissioner.
He wants you to meet him at Peakestown.
Looks like the pot's started to boil.
What's Pontiac say?
Says the Delawares will join and the Shawnees and the Chippewas.
He ain't sure about the Wyandots.
They'll come in when their powder horns are full.
Steady there, steady.
Back that tray up,
'tis powder.
Hang on.
MAN: Take up the slack in the quarter line.
Get up, Leach, and let me sign these.
Yes, sir, Mr. Garth.
Wicked waste of money.
By you?
Captain Holden setting that girl free.
Yes, very wasteful.
How would you like to sell all your bond slaves to Mr. Bone, here?
Bond slaves?
I got no use for...
Say, £400?
Well... Why, sold.
All except...
Except no one.
But that girl is free.
You're sailing next week.
Who'd know?
Double-selling a bond slave is a hanging offense.
Here's a mink for you, so the rope won't scratch your neck.
Mr. Leach, Captain Holden said you'd give me my papers.
Well...
He said that?
Yes, he set me free.
Free? That's carrying a joke too far.
What is?
First he pretends to buy the girl, then he pretends to set her free.
He did buy me.
If he bought a girl as pretty as you, he'd never set her free.
Mr. Leach?
I'm sure the gentleman meant no harm.
But he'd have told me.
He didn't have the courage.
It is rather a grim joke.
You bought me.
No. Bone.
Where're you going?
He'll sell the others at Peakestown Fair.
You're not for sale.
I won't go with him.
You'll go all right.
I ain't bad company.
Get the furs aboard and the slaves ashore.
Start west before night.
What's the matter, Jason?
You're not singing.
I guess there ain't much singing left in me,
Master Chris.
Just thinking.
You're thinking, too, Diana?
Why? Haven't l been talking?
Yes, you've been talking, but about dogs and colts and cotton.
About most everything except us.
Well, the mosquitoes are glad l'm back anyway.
Oh, l'm glad you're back, Chris.
So is your brother, Harold.
Poor Hal.
Poor?
Well, we can't both have you, Diana.
Chris, when l look into your eyes, l don't see myself there.
You must be a little blind.
I see horizons, ranges of uncrossed mountains, the unknown.
You belong to that, Chris, the way an eagle belongs to the sky.
But l'm different.
No, you're not.
Let me tell you what l see in your eyes.
No.
You won't like the view.
It doesn't go beyond the walls of Holden Hall.
What are you trying to say?
Something l've been trying to tell you in everything but words.
Hal and l are married.
You married Holden Hall and £20,000 a year.
I married the things l want, Chris.
Where are we, Jason?
Just passing Blount's Landing,
Master Chris.
Put me ashore.
Chris, come home and meet your brother.
I don't care to inherit the brand of Cain.
He set aside £20,000 for you.
I paid £100 for a little thief aboard ship.
I think you were overpriced.
I was never yours to sell.
I guess you're right.
Your wedding present's in those trunks.
There's a green dress with all the fluff to go with it, designed by Forgel,
Madame Pompadour's dressmaker.
Just right for you.
Cost £187.
Here are the keys.
You'll find someone more worthy than l am to wear them.
Some squaw, west of the Alleghenies.
Swing those trunks ashore.
Yes, sir, Master Chris.
Oh, Chris, you'll forget me in no time.
You'll forget that in no time.
Just pile that stuff right here.
I'll get a wagon.
Yes, sir, Master Chris.
Take me with you,
Master Chris.
You're not mine to take.
I'll miss you, Jason.
You taught me most of what l know.
You might have taught me a little more about women.
Goodbye, old friend.
MAN: Now, while balancing himself on one foot with nothing between him and the ground but this knife-sharp wire, he will cut in two a paper tube held in the mouths of these fair young damsels.
Don't worry if he misses, he told me they were two-faced.
This gentleman...
Hi, there, John Fraser.
Ain't you a long way from Pittsburgh?
Five days and 150 miles uphill both ways.
...that far-famed monster of Madagascar, the one-horned Boukabekabus.
Two, sir.
Thank you.
With the hide of a bull, the head of a unicorn, and the wisdom of a prophet, he has astonished the crowned heads of Europe and now can be seen for three days only right here in Peakestown.
Hey, blacksmith, think you could hammer shoes on that?
Pittsburgh, he'd be a house pet.
Cider. Cider.
Fresh, sweet cider.
Hard as a rock.
Cider here.
...hazard and risk for your education and recreation.
Neptune's loveliest daughter, she has the face of a female and the body of a fish.
She has lured, my friends, many a brave sea captain to his destruction.
Now, you with the spinning wheel there, don't go away. Come on in.
Come in, folks.
You've never seen anything like it before.
You'll never see anything like it again.
Scales on her tail and...
Thank you very much, sir.
Scales on her tail and seaweed in her hair.
The greatest exhibit at the Peakestown Fair.
HOLDEN:
You can't take her home to your wife, John Fraser.
Chris. Chris Holden.
I've been looking all over for you.
By gollys, how are you?
Did you expect to find me in there with the mermaid?
Aw, shucks. I wasn't...
Pile your loot in the back and climb aboard.
Say, ain't you traveling kind of fancy?
What did you bring back, the London Bridge?
Well, a green dress for a bride and women's doodads, which l expect to swap for trade goods.
Well, get over.
Yep. I heard about her.
Chris, you wasn't cut out to marry no Tidewater lady and just rusticate.
I don't know what the good Lord was about when he made a female out of a perfectly good rib.
We'll tote your doodads over to Fort Pitt.
Officers' wives will pay more for them.
That's quite a speech for you.
But you didn't bring me out here just to tell me that.
What's going on?
Trouble, Chris.
You can smell it as far as a flea can smell a dog.
Keep this covered.
Where did you get this?
Off an Injun that aimed a mite too high.
The Indian Commissioner seen it?
Sir William?
No, not yet.
I kept it for you.
MAN: Going twice.
Sold to the gent in the butternut vest for £14.
Pay the notary, mister.
He'll give you your papers.
Put your hat on, lad.
It's your sweat l'm buying, not your spirit.
You don't have to bow and scrape to me.
Take this one for £1.
He'll keep the crows off your field.
All right, come along.
Let's see.
Say, you. Yeah.
I'm looking to buy a wife for my son.
Oh, wife.
Here, young lady.
A buxom lass from Lancashire.
She can outwork a horse.
Kind and loving as a dove.
Made a little mistake, that's all.
She'll make your son a fine, affectionable wife.
What do you say, Son?
Joshua, what's the matter with you?
Ma, buy me that one.
She ain't for sale.
Get back on the wagon.
Why did you tell me to stand here and smile?
For bait. Get going.
BONE: Now, lady, what's your bid?
WOMAN: Let me talk to this girl private.
Look, Abby, there's Captain Holden going into the tavern.
BONE: Here you are, folks, this young fella's as strong as a goat and smart as a fox.
I'd rather look at the devil himself.
BONE: Takes to work like a duck to water.
What do you say?
Colonel Washington is here too, Chris.
I thought maybe you and him might get the Indian Commissioner to...
What's biting you?
You ain't going to buy a bond slave, are you?
That girl looks like one l've already bought.
It is, Captain.
The moment you left, she came to me.
I use her for drawing crowds.
And l thought she was only a thief.
Hello, Chris,
Mr. Garth. Mr. Lee.
Colonel Washington.
You said to fetch him, George.
You know the Indian Commissioner,
Sir William Johnson.
How are you, Captain?
Sir William.
I haven't seen you since the Indians chased us off Braddock's Field.
What's the matter?
You look as though they'd just caught up with you.
Mr. Garth was just enlightening me on the manners and morals of bond slaves.
My wife was a bond slave, you know, Captain Holden.
One of my teachers was an indentured convict, Chris.
Fine man. Never could teach me to spell.
Coming?
Yes, sir.
I'll join you inside,
Sir William.
BUYER: Fourteen.
Only £14 for as handy a couple as you'll find this side of Cape Henry.
I don't want both.
I bid £14 for the man.
The woman is yours, mister, for £6 more.
A woman's no good in my fields.
Oh, Ben, hold me close.
I'm frightened.
Who'll say £20 for them both? You?
MAN: Not me.
You?
Then it's £14 for the man.
Sold to this gentleman here.
Now, what am l bid for the woman?
Don't sell us apart,
Mr. Bone.
You'd be apart if you was serving your terms in prison.
Now, what am l bid for this?
Who'll say six for the woman?
It's not human to sell a man away from his wife, Mr. Bone.
Shut your yap.
Don't buy him alone, sir.
Please.
I don't buy women.
But she's his wife.
Keep quiet.
You never said they're man and wife, fella.
They're slaves, ain't they?
I'm not breaking up a family.
The girl's right.
Get down there.
Don't whip her because of me, Mr. Bone.
Keep out of this.
Don't worry about me, Maggie.
Get on down there.
Take over, Art.
Don't go away, gentlemen.
Don't go away.
Come on, we can see over the top.
Here's a good, strong field hand for your plantation.
Strong of back.
Strong of arm.
What am l bid.
Do l hear £10?
You'll get it now.
Please don't.
MAN: Hold your tongue.
You've been asking for this.
It's time to learn who's your master.
Maybe it is, Bone.
She spiked a sale.
Loose her.
MAN: Ain't they gonna tan her?
WOMAN:
They're taking her down.
Fix your dress in the tent, Abby.
Are you out of your mind?
You said to gentle her.
Flogging collects a crowd.
Chris Holden's here.
Has he seen her?
Yes.
Sell what you can and get going for Pittsburgh.
He hurt you.
I'm all right.
I'm sorry about this.
Why did you stop him?
I hoped you would forgive and forget.
Slavery hasn't taught me forgiveness.
Or gratitude.
I'm grateful for what you've done.
I can do more.
Would you help me get away?
Where?
There isn't a town in these colonies big enough to hide that red hair of yours.
Some try for the west.
The west?
You've never seen a doe dragged down by a wolf pack or a white woman when an Indian war party had done with her.
You don't know what freedom's worth until you lose it.
Isn't worth much against a Shawnee torture stake.
Hanging in England is quick, Abby.
Is it worse than
14 years of bondage with Bone?
It doesn't have to be bondage or Bone.
GARTH: Hannah.
Mamaultee bring word from my father.
Well?
Guyasuta say to Garth,
Pontiac at Wolf Creek.
Hannah, look after this girl.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
White one. Pretty.
Who are you?
A bond slave.
He no look at you like bond slave.
His.
Who are you?
His wife.
For years, gentlemen, l've had the Indians' friendship.
I sometimes think that only an Irishman can really understand the red man.
Now, maybe l'm getting old, but l still know the signs.
There's a cloud of trouble coming down over the Ohio with the sound of war drums in it.
I've heard them before.
And l know that closing your ears to them can cost you your scalp.
What's behind it,
Sir William?
Mr. Carroll, when old enemies like the Ottawas, the Shawnees, and the Senecas meet together in council, the thread's off the bobbin.
Perhaps just a meeting to bury the hatchet.
In somebody's skull.
Do you think there's war in this, Colonel Washington?
The whole frontier's a powder keg.
And those two gentlemen were almost the fuse.
Mr. Mason and Mr. Dixon, the London astronomers, have been running a survey to settle Pennsylvania's boundary line and her claim to Pittsburgh and the Ohio country.
Pittsburgh, gentlemen, is in Virginia.
You can see for yourselves.
But, Brother Lee,
Pittsburgh is in Pennsylvania and the whole
Ohio Territory is...
Mine.
Yours, Mr. Garth?
Yes.
I'm no surveyor, gentlemen, but the Allegheny runs here and the Monongahela.
Here's Pittsburgh.
Colonel Washington wants this territory for Virginia.
Mr. Andrews thinks it's in Pennsylvania.
But l hold deeds to it from the Indians.
The Indians cannot deed lands, Mr. Garth.
Not by law.
Whose law?
Pennsylvania's? Virginia's?
The King's law.
The King's law moves with the King's muskets.
And there are very few King's muskets west of the Alleghenies.
There's only bear, beaver and muskrat, and they don't need boundary lines.
Mr. Garth.
The very heavens need boundary lines.
Mr. Mason and l have measured the distance from Earth to Mars.
There are no savages between
Earth and Mars, Mr. Dixon.
There are 10,000 red hot ones between here and the Ohio.
And it's no place for surveyors or settlers.
You're there.
I rule it.
You can't rule part of Pennsylvania.
Nor Virginia.
Nobody rules it until this survey is completed.
And l regret to inform you that the Mason and Dixon Line has been stopped.
Stopped?
When?
How could it be stopped?
WASHINGTON: Mr. Mason.
Stopped rather thoroughly at Dunkard's Creek by a band of painted aborigines.
It must have been a hunting party.
Why should Indians stop a survey?
Why?
To hide the movement of war parties across the Ohio trail.
ALL: War parties?
The Senecas, the Ottawas,
Delawares, Shawnees...
You mean a general uprising?
MAN: Have they powder and lead?
War parties?
Is that possible,
Sir William?
So possible that we have forbidden the sale of firearms to the Indians.
But, Sir William, no one could bring those tribes together.
I think there is someone,
Mr. Garth.
Who?
Pontiac.
Pontiac?
The Ottawa chief?
Pontiac's a friend of the white man.
Which white man?
Those who stay east of the Alleghenies.
Mr. Garth has just been in England trying to get a law passed prohibiting settlement west of the Allegheny.
He wants the whole fur empire to himself.
Settlers will never be safe west of the mountains.
Why, their homes are there.
Their graves will be there, unless you call them back.
Mr. Garth.
Those people will never abandon a settlement like Pittsburgh.
I'm sorry,
Colonel Washington.
I know you selected that site yourself, but after all, a fort at the end of the earth, guarding nothing, on a couple of useless rivers.
That triangle of land, sir, may be the most vital spot in this country.
Oh, my dear Colonel.
I visited John Fraser's forge there once.
And saw...
Coal and iron, that's what he saw.
Pittsburgh's like a hen sitting on more coal than she can hatch in a thousand years.
Cook the iron with that coal and what've you got? Steel.
Why, that town'll sprout into a city of maybe four or five thousand folks.
Don't laugh, gentlemen.
John's a good gunsmith and we may need more guns than words to build a future.
I've given my opinion.
If you ignore it, l'll wash my hands clean of the whole matter.
I hope they stay clean.
Captain Holden.
Mr. Garth knows the Indians.
He ought to.
He's married to Guyasuta's daughter and is a blood brother of the Senecas.
Watch your words, man.
Didn't you exchange blood with Guyasuta?
Yes.
That's why the Senecas trade with me rather than with Crawford or Croghan.
My trading posts would be the first to go up in the smoke of an Indian war.
Then why did you send hundreds of muskets from England?
Thousands of flints, tons of bar lead and powder to...
Captain Holden, what are you suggesting?
Captain Holden is somewhat bitter toward me because of a pretty bond slave aboard ship.
Seems he's lost his famous luck with the ladies.
You still haven't explained the shipments of arms, Mr. Garth.
Explain them?
I deny them.
Any other information you'd like?
Yes.
In case of an Indian war, which side would you be on?
I've killed men for less than that.
For much less.
Captain Holden, l suggest that you control yourself and leave Mr. Garth to control the Indians.
Control?
No one can control the Indians, once they've sent around the red belt of war.
But if you close the Ohio to settlement, the war belt will never be passed.
It has been passed.
What?
When?
MAN: That's hard to believe.
How do you know?
John Fraser took this off an Ottawa near Venango.
Crossed tomahawks.
The war belt.
A war belt!
That otter there is Pontiac's sign.
On its way to Guyasuta.
Mr. Garth's blood brother.
Colonel Bouquet, that belt makes it a matter for the army.
I have no army.
What? Why?
The Black Watch is just in from the Caribbean, fever among the men.
Do you expect miracles?
We cannot be ready for four months.
Four months?
There won't be a live settler west of the mountains.
Then pull your settlers back.
Or stop the war before it breaks.
How?
By sending peace belts to all the chiefs.
Peace belts?
Yes.
Why not, Sir William?
Calling a council.
It's worked before.
Pontiac'd make buzzard bait out of the man hat carried them.
No.
No, l believe the peace belts could get through if they were carried by an expert woodsman such as Captain Holden.
Holden?
It'd be murder, Chris.
Why?
He knows the Indians, he knows the trails, and he's a dead shot.
What do you say,
Captain Holden?
I'll take them, Sir William.
That was a brave thing you just said, Captain.
I'll provide the scouts,
Captain.
I guess l'll provide my own scouts, Mr. Garth.
Where'll you be?
Wolf Creek with Guyasuta and Pontiac.
BONE: Get back in the wagon.
How soon can you start?
Tonight, if John Fraser gets me buckskins and a rifle.
The peace belts will not be ready for three days.
How will you go?
By Nemacolin's Path.
I'll take charge of the pathfinding.
You're not going, John.
Now, Chris, there's no reason...
Your wife would skin me alive.
You're going to drive my gear to Pittsburgh.
Captain, your mission is confidential.
If you run into trouble, you cannot tell the military or we'll have this war on our hands before we can fight it.
Colonel Bouquet is right.
Action by the military is the one thing that would instantly unite all the tribes behind Pontiac.
You'll be playing a Ione hand, Chris.
You might have use for this compass.
It's not Boston Common you'll be crossing.
WASHINGTON:
Indeed, it's not.
Headstones are the only milestones on Nemacolin's Path.
I haven't seen a bird or a wild critter in an hour.
Me, neither.
It don't smell right.
Joe.
Clean through the heart.
He's dead.
I've got the belts.
Come on. Save your scalp.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
Dan, grab that branch.
This dang tree needs pruning.
My powder horn.
My powder horn, he's seen it.
Well, that's one good Injun.
Ottawa.
What's Ottawas doing in Seneca country?
Ask Garth.
No time for souvenirs, come on.
I reckon we shook them off.
You can't ever shake off an Indian.
I left my wind about six miles back.
I ought to have my brain dusted.
With that skull ax?
A few days ago, this tomahawk was on a ship with Garth.
He didn't waste much time passing them around.
Garth knew these belts were going through and he knew we were carrying them.
That's why Joe Lavat's back there with an arrow through him.
You still delivering peace belts?
We've got another job to do first, Dan.
Killing Garth, l guess.
I guess.
That's my job, Dan.
We'll split up and if l don't get through to Pittsburgh, the job is yours.
Let's get going.
I'm traveling over
Chestnut Ridge.
I'll cross Turkey Foot to the Old Braddock Road.
Nothing ever travels that but ghosts.
Be sure you ain't one of them.
Thanks.
I'll meet you on Coal Hill above Fort Pitt before noon.
Before noon.
You want this compass?
No.
I'd get lost.
Well, so long, Captain.
So long, Fur-face.
Dan McCoy with a compass.
Hang onto your powder horn this time.
What're you drinking?
Rum.
So am I.
Hey.
Well, don't swallow the cup.
I won't.
Five fingers of rum to drink to the King's birthday.
Go on and be nice to them.
None of that that trade slop you feed the savages.
MAN: Hey, get that jug of rum over here.
Ale.
Hey, you're pretty.
Ain't been here long, have you?
You've been here too long.
What's your name, dearie?
Corn whiskey.
Come here, Corn Whiskey.
Oh, don't. No, please.
I ain't gonna hurt you.
I just want...
Better you spilled blood.
Scrub it up before Bone beats the daylights out of you.
Come on. Come on or Bone'll charge you for a bath.
Hey, what about my liquor?
MAN 1: Lap it up off the floor, Jim.
MAN 2: Jake, you owe me one for this.
JAKE: There's plenty more at the bar.
Why you no run away?
Run away, Hannah? Where?
Where he no find you.
Garth?
He come here tonight for you.
Spilling that grog will add a year onto your time.
But l didn't...
Get out there.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
Here's your bottle.
Keep out of sight.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
Them Indians won't trade for nothing but gunpowder.
Give it to them.
It's breaking the law.
Give it to them.
And so, gentlemen, you see a mink skin.
But observe.
The mink skin is no longer a mink skin.
It has become a silver button.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
(BONE SPEAKING
NATIVE AMERICAN LANGUAGE)
What's the ruckus?
Well, this aborigine here claims there were five little minks.
See for yourself there are only four.
One, two, three, four.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
Why, you worthless, lard-bellied, thieving...
Trying to start a massacre?
We've got enough trouble.
Some more just came in the door.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
Keep scrubbing.
Get along.
Looking for somebody?
Garth trade here?
Some.
Where is he?
How do l know?
This Ottawa knows.
No, he just come in from up north.
Northeast, maybe from Chestnut Ridge.
What of it?
He's a friendly Indian.
He is? Then, why is he wearing a dead man's powder horn?
He ain't.
Powder horns are easy to get.
Not this one.
Get Mr. Bone a drink.
From over there.
This Indian killed Dan McCoy to get a leather pouch.
Where is it?
I don't know.
But if you came here looking for trouble, you've found it.
Keep both hands on that drink, Mr. Bone.
Where's the pouch?
Is this what you're looking for?
Shut your...
Bone.
Yes, that's it.
You've certainly come down in the world.
So has my opinion of you.
Is this Mr. Garth's hospitality?
You're not going anywhere.
Keep your hands flat on the bar.
I figured you'd do better with your freedom.
What freedom?
Freedom to be beaten with a whip, to serve and to scrub and milk, from sunup to midnight?
Then crawl into a cornhusk bed too tired to sleep or even cry?
Why don't you quit?
A slave can't quit.
Slave?
But l set you free.
You never set her free.
No. He bought me and tonight he's selling me to Garth.
Shut up, you.
Keep both hands on that drink, Mr. Bone.
Tonight, huh?
Get your things, Abby.
I haven't any things.
You have two feet, get up on them and bring the pouch.
I'll break your arms if...
No, you won't.
I bought her and if she's not free, she's mine.
Get behind me, Abby.
Now start for the door.
Art. Jake.
ART: Coming, boss.
JAKE: I'll get him.
I'll put a hole through the first thing in this room that moves.
Slave stealing means hanging.
You've got the right neck for it, Mr. Bone. Get your hand back on that drink.
Garth will be looking for you.
That's the idea.
That one was for Dan McCoy.
There's another one here for Joe Lavat if anybody wants it.
Get that rifle and get him at gunpoint.
We'll get him, boss.
Where to?
Fraser's forge, and don't pick my pocket on the way.
Hello, John.
Chris, what are you doing here?
You must have been traveling on a broomstick.
Sit down and let your breath catch up with you.
I thought you was on a job for Colonel Washington.
I am.
Well, what happened?
An Ottawa.
What's that?
A lady.
Thank you.
Did you bring her here to get shod?
Well, she cast a shoe.
John Fraser.
Yeah.
Where's that pressing iron you were heating for me?
Scalping's too good for you.
Standing there lollygagging with every Tom...
Land o'mighty, Chris!
Well, Half-Pint.
Let me look at you.
(EXCLAIMS) Pretty.
Oh, Chris.
Right in front of my own husband.
What'd you come here for?
King's birthday ball?
I didn't know he was having one, but l came to dance it with you.
You're the biggest liar ever crossed the Alleghenies, except my John.
Chris, you're making me dizzy.
Stop prancing and tell me the truth.
Well, l tell you l came to trap a skunk.
Appears to me you trapped a chipmunk.
I beg your pardon,
Mistress Abigail, l want you to meet the love of my life,
Mrs. John Fraser.
Your servant, ma'am.
Well, she's nice-mannered.
She's the wench from the tavern.
Garth'll nail your hide to the barn door for this.
He owns everything in that tavern. What'd you bring her here for?
To give her a bath.
Save us, what next?
What for you want to give her a bath?
Because she's dirty.
Look at her hair, look at her clothes, look at her...
Well, look at her.
She's stolen goods, Chris.
Ain't your place to wash other people's belongings.
Scrub her clean enough and even Garth won't know her.
You're just plumb crazy.
Where's that luggage of mine you brought from Peakestown?
She can't go to the ball looking like that.
The King's birthday ball? Me?
He is crazy.
I believe you're right.
You're gonna be scrubbed so clean that you're gonna look like new.
Not by you, l'm not.
Now your back.
Oh, stop wiggling, child.
I have soap in my mouth.
Well, keep it shut.
Skin's real pink when you get down to it.
More water.
This ought to fit.
She's about Diana's size.
I won't go to the ball.
You can't drag me around in your wife's old clothes.
Washing a slave girl ain't gonna stop no Injun bust-out.
Washing this one might.
Hey, what's this?
I don't know.
It's nothing for a bachelor.
Where's that water?
Bachelor? He's not a bachelor.
Oh, yes, he is, and he's gonna stay one.
You didn't get married?
No.
My uniform's in the other trunk.
Where is it, John?
In here.
He didn't get married.
Lucky escape for some woman. Stand up.
Chris, the whole frontier's just ready to bust wide open and here you are traipsing around with a little...
John, did you ever catch a bear with honey?
SERVANT:
Mr. And Mrs. George Carter.
I'll be right back, Carl.
All right, Sara.
Name, please.
Not me. Everybody knows me.
All right, sir.
Howdy, Carl.
I'm ready.
I'm hankering for a dance.
WOMAN: Oh, hello, Sally.
Having a good time?
Oh, Captain Ecuyer.
Every lady in Pittsburgh is simply perishing for a dance with you.
My dancing was ended by an old wound.
In the heart, Captain Ecuyer?
Unfortunately, a trifle lower.
I left my dancing days in
Switzerland. Captain Steele dances for me here.
I'll hold you to that, sir.
Look.
That's a vulgar noise,
Captain, but l agree with it.
Captain Christopher Holden,
Mistress Abigail Hale.
MAN: Abigail Hale?
Why are they staring so?
You look like Venus emerging from an emerald sea.
What a heavenly gown.
What an angel in it.
How would l look in a dress like that, Jim?
You'll never know, Ma.
How do you do?
I know you by reputation,
Captain Holden.
What brings you to Pittsburgh?
A lady from London, sir.
Mistress Abigail Hale,
Captain Ecuyer,
Commandant of Fort Pitt.
A charming breath of England to sweeten our wilderness.
My second in command,
Captain Steele.
Captain.
Your servant, ma'am.
I'm sure we've met before.
I think not, Captain, l've been very closely guarded.
We crossed the Atlantic on the same ship. She was allowed very little freedom.
You're still a riddle to me,
Miss Hale. Perhaps this dance will help solve it.
I'll solve this one,
Captain.
Outmaneuvered, Captain, huh?
John Fraser, l believe you're going to faint.
Get me to the punch bowl,
Mother.
Fine feathers certainly make a difference.
In this case, the bird improves the feathers.
You're quite a burst of plumage yourself,
Captain Holden.
You mean birds of a feather?
No, you think l'm a thief.
And you thought l was a liar.
I've seen that girl somewhere.
Must have been heaven.
GUARD 1: Post number two.
GUARD 2: Post number three.
GUARD 3: Post number four.
GUARD 4: Post number five.
All's well, isn't it?
Too quiet.
You seem to be watching for something.
Watchfulness isn't a bad thing, Abby, when you are at the edge of the end of the world.
Why? What's there?
Forests and savages.
The end of the present, the beginning of the future.
The beginning of the future,
Captain Holden?
Chris.
Why did you really come to Pittsburgh, Chris?
The moonlight is turning your dress into green fire.
It wasn't to set me free, as it?
And the stars are dancing in your eyes.
Did you come through
500 miles of wilderness to tell me the stars are dancing in my eyes?
Can you think of any better reason?
A woman only thinks what she wants to.
And you want to think l came to set you free?
Maybe no one has the right to own anyone else.
Men and women weren't made to be bought like yards of cloth.
At the tavern, you said you owned me.
I do.
But you want to be free, don't you?
I wonder...
Hey, you're ruining the ordnance.
I'm not sure l want to be free of you, Chris.
Why do you say that?
Because you've taken me out of a horrible nightmare.
Because you've given me kindness and happiness and understanding.
Abby, listen to me.
It wasn't kindness and understanding that made me bring you here.
No? Why did you bring me?
Because l know
Garth will follow.
Garth?
When he sees you here like this, he'll try to take you back, and then l can do what l came to
Pittsburgh to do.
Kill him? Is that it?
Yes, that's it.
And l'm the bait, staked out like a deer to draw a tiger.
That's true, isn't it?
Yes.
And you said the stars were in my eyes.
They were there.
Because l thought...
Oh, it doesn't matter.
Everything that you've done for me is because you wanted to challenge Garth.
You're not a man.
You're a walking loaded rifle with one bloodthirsty purpose, to kill Garth.
You haven't blood in your veins, you've gunpowder.
Abby, maybe you're right.
But this is more important than you or me, or both of us.
If Garth doesn't die within the next few hours, a lot of men and women on this frontier will.
You're either the world's greatest liar or the world's greatest fool.
You're probably both.
I'm going.
You'll stay and see it through.
Why should I?
Because l own you.
A few minutes ago you said nobody should be owned.
Do you ever mean anything you say, Captain Holden?
Here's your good-luck piece.
You'll need it when you meet Mr. Garth.
Miss Hale, l couldn't find you for our dance.
Yes, l know.
No, this one's mine, isn't it, Miss Hale?
No, l'm sorry.
Perhaps the next one,
Miss Hale.
Mistress Hale, you promised this dance to me.
What's happened to Chris?
Gentlemen, l'm not dancing.
Mrs. Fraser, may l have this dance?
I'd love to.
Love? With me?
Mistress Hale.
You promised.
There'll be no living with Baillie after this.
Yeah.
She's madder than a bucketful of hornets, Chris.
You needn't signal,
Mr. Fraser.
He'll know l'm here.
The bear has come for the honey.
He's come for your hide.
Then stand away from me,
Half-Pint.
Ladies and gentlemen, your attention, please.
Mistress Hale, will you come forward?
They're going to crown you queen of the ball.
I think not.
May l have your arm, please?
Yes, Captain Ecuyer?
Is this the young lady,
Mr. Garth?
Yes, sir.
My runaway bond slave.
MAN: Bond slave?
I knew l'd seen her before.
WOMAN:
Mistress Hale from England.
Mistress Hale...
Quiet, quiet, please.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
I'll take this girl.
Lieutenant, you may finish this dance with Miss Hale.
Well, sir, that's mighty good of you, but...
This girl is mine.
Captain Ecuyer, Mr. Garth has three indisputable talents.
He is a liar, a cheat and a coward.
Captain Holden.
Captain, l bought this girl, which makes him a liar, he stole her from me, which makes him a cheat, and he won't fight, which makes him a coward.
By your leave, sir.
Captain Steele, will you arrange the time and the place?
Who speaks for you, sir?
John Fraser, and the sooner the better.
The King's birthday ball is no place to arrange a duel.
Mr. Garth and l can step outside and settle this in a few minutes.
Sunup tomorrow.
The light will be better.
In the meantime, l'll take my property.
Not by law.
I am the law here.
The question of who owns this girl will be settled in my office.
Sergeant, music.
Yes, sir.
Ladles and gentlemen, continue dancing, please.
Captain Steele, bring
Miss Hale to my office.
Gentlemen.
WOMAN 1: Well, it might be, so come away.
WOMAN 2:
She scrubs the floors at Bone's tavern.
MAN 1: She can scrub the floor at my house any time she wants.
WOMAN 3: I wonder where she got that dress.
MAN 2: Stolen, l reckon.
Did you know this,
Jane Fraser?
Of course l did.
She's a mighty fine girl.
WOMAN 4: I still say that dress came from Paris.
Don't you go boiling over in there, now.
You ain't supposed to let on to the military why you're here.
Keep your scalp on, John.
Mine's on tighter than yours.
Captain Holden, you haven't one scrap of reason or evidence to support your claim to this girl.
The law requires a bill of sale.
I have it.
Norfolk notary.
Sold to Bone. Bone to me.
ECUYER:
These papers are in order.
You come brawling into Mr. Garth's tavern, killing Indians, stealing bond slaves and now you answer his rightful claim by hurling challenges like a bully in a schoolyard.
Captain Holden's been trying to pick a quarrel with me ever since we left England.
Why?
I ask permission not to answer that.
GARTH: He's a bad loser, that's all.
His vanity was hurt over this girl and he's followed me here to repair it with a bullet.
Is that true?
Did you come here because of this girl?
Yes, sir.
This woman is yours,
Mr. Garth.
You can take her.
Do you realize what you have done to this woman?
Mr. Garth has the legal right to give her the whipping post, the pillory, or the branding iron if he chooses to use it.
Mr. Garth won't live to use It.
Good evening, Captain Ecuyer.
Come, Abby.
You'd better take her out this way.
Captain Holden, you are under my orders.
If you harm... l'll send the dress back to you, Captain Holden.
I'm going after that girl.
No, you are not.
If you try, you'll spend the next five years in the fort's dungeon.
And don't look as though you'd like to cut my heart out.
It's against regulations.
Shall we join the ladies?
Bone leave for Venango?
Yes, two hours ago.
You know what to do.
Abby. You. Get out.
A little sherry, perhaps.
No.
I once penned an ode to the wines of Spain.
"Italian wines are rich..."
Abby. Wait.
"The wines of France are light as air but the wines of Spain..."
Are you going?
"The wines of Spain..."
Why did you go with Holden?
To be free.
He can't set you free.
He may, when he meets you at sunup tomorrow.
Tomorrow never comes.
Aren't you going to fight him?
I don't have to fight for you.
You're mine, just as my horse or my dogs or my boots are mine.
I'll serve my time, 14 years, l'll work faithfully...
Faithfully?
Running away with Holden?
I'm not going to punish you.
But you'll never forget again who you belong to.
Drums of war sound.
All fort die by white flag that is red.
Why do the Indians come to you?
Guyasuta wait for Garth.
You're with them.
Bring the girl.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN

Take your hands off me.
Stop it. Hannah, please make them stop.

Jeremy.
You savages.
And you fighting a duel in the morning.
Why, this might be your last dance.
Excuse me, ma'am, l'll go and make my will.
Sorry, sir, you're not to pass.
Captain Ecuyer.
Where's the Captain?
What's happened?
Don't let those people in here. This is the King's birthday ball.
I'm sorry, sir, this woman's in distress...
Save your children.
Go. Go get your children.
That's Joe Pruitt's missus from Clapham's.
Clapham's?
That's more than 20 miles.
WOMAN 1: Poor soul.
WOMAN 2: Let me help.
Stand back. Give her room.
Clapham's ain't no more.
They're all dead.
What happened?
Injuns, they killed my Joe.
No.
That child is badly hurt.
Get Dr. Boyd.
Yes, sir.
Some brandy for this woman.
Yes, sir.
They crept up in the night.
How many?
More than 100 of them.
They massacred Colonel Clapham and all his womenfolk and Jim Mealy and the Garvice boys.
The murdering devils. Holden.
WOMAN: My babies.
I've got to get my babies.
Tom, come on.
My kids. I left them with a Seneca squaw.
Well, l was just visiting here.
May be a long visit.
Attention, everyone.
You will bring your families into the fort, your livestock and foodstuffs.
Major Trent, as the settlers come in, form them into militia companies.
Yes, sir.
Captain Steele, put the entire garrison under arms at their posts of alarm.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Hutchins.
Yes, sir.
Run up the signal torch on the gate staff.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Baillie.
Yes, sir.
One squad to stand by the drawbridge.
It remains down till all the settlers are in.
Yes, sir.
Sir, order to load the powder magazine.
Captain Holden.
Yes, sir.
Since you are anxious to leave, take 20 men and level the town.
Dismantle what you can and burn the rest.
Yes, sir.
And leave nothing standing to give cover to the savages.
Take Fraser.
Yes, sir.
Captain Holden.
Be sure you come back.
Yes, sir.
You can't burn my place,
Holden. It took me two years to build that store.
It'll take you all eternity to grow a new scalp.
Where to first, Chris?
Bone's tavern.
Watch your torches.
Move that log out of the way!
Search this place, men.
OFFICER: Stroud, stand watch by the door.
Go to Black Watch's until ordered.
Abby. Abby.
Search back there.
Keep you eyes peeled, now.
Abby.
Everywhere.
Sergeant, pile up everything in this room that will burn.
Yes, sir.
Not in the middle, against the counter...
Captain Holden.
Captain Holden.
JEREMY: Captain Holden.
Hey, Chris, come here.
Yes, sir.
Bring those chairs over here and throw them on.
Yes, sir.
Throw those bundles over.
Where's Abby?
They've taken her,
Hannah and the Indians, to Guyasuta's camp.
MAN: Hurry up, before those redsticks get here.
Guyasuta?
Yes.
Get me some dried meat and a powder horn.
Lend me your rifle and powder horn, John.
Chris, you can't go after her.
You wouldn't stand a chance.
You've seen what they do to white women.
Where are your bullets?
Ecuyer ordered you to burn this town.
They'll burn her.
And you spitted right alongside her.
Chris, you're the goldarndest, contrariest fool l ever did see. I'm going with you.
You're staying here and carrying out
Ecuyer's orders.
Here you are, Captain.
The dried meat and powder horn.
What am l going to tell
Ecuyer about you?
You tell him l'll report to him in heaven, if we both get there.
Good luck, sir.
MAN: All clear upstairs.
All right, put the torch to it.
Let her go.
Let it all come down.
Fire in the stable.
Yes, sir.
Throw a torch under the stairwell.
Here, strike the Ottawas under Pontiac.
Fort Detroit.
Here, the Mingos of Chief Skarat.
Fort Niagara.
Here, the Wyandots of Chief Takee.
Fort Sandusky.
Here, the Senecas under you, Genowah.
Fort Venango.
And here you, Guyasuta, with Delawares, Shawnees and Senecas.
Fort Pitt.
Ecuyer is a shrewd, strong warrior.
Sioto has made medicine.
Fort Pitt will die.
All these forts must die.
By white flag that is red.

Is the white girl safe?
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN

(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN

My daughter your woman.
She go with you.
As my brother wishes.
But the white girl stays here.
Protect her.
What are they going to do?
Before white one come,
Garth see only this one.
I've tried to tell you that he...
This one love Garth, very big love.
He doesn't mean anything to me.
He mean much to me.
Soon white one, no more.
This one go with husband.
Hannah.
I've heard what they do to white women.
I'm not very brave.
Will you ask them please to let it be quick?
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
Never quick.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
Chris.
Chris, go back! Go back!
Maybe l've come to the wrong village.
I was looking for great warriors, the Seneca.
Chris, you can't save me.
We are Seneca.
These?
These are not the Senecas l know. I was there when they stopped Braddock.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
These...
These are just squaws painted like men, only fit to torture women.
Chris, they'll kill you.
Keep your tongue between your teeth.
Who calls himself Chief among these woman fighters?
I am Guyasuta.
You think we are women?
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
I am unarmed.
You forget your own laws.
Tell these squaws l come in peace.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
You come in peace, go in peace.
That's better.
Untie her.
Why you come?
I bring belts of peace from Sir William.
Red belt of war has passed.
White man's forts will burn. All die.
White woman burn.
Some may die, but more will come, always more.
White man's medicine is strong, nothing can stop them.
Sioto medicine stop them.
Can Sioto match his medicine against mine?
Sioto can make rains come, winds blow.
Sioto can speak to the dead.
With my medicine l can take this woman, even this worthless squaw and vanish as l came, and Sioto and all your braves can never find us.
You speak big words.
Stand back.
This magic is strong.
It obeys only me.
Watch this little arrow.
It is magic.
Little arrow point to that tree and nowhere else.
Now, you feathered vulture, you make it point somewhere else.
Here, take it.
If it obeys you, the girl dies and l die with her.
But if it does not obey Sioto, l will take the girl and you cannot follow until the arrow turns.
Is it a bargain?
It is bargain.
Make arrow point.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
Looks like the little arrow only hears the white man's tongue.
Point at fire.
Little arrow, do not listen to Sioto's medicine.
Point at fire.
Looks like you're not doing so well.
Oh, Chris.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
Sioto say not magic.
Arrow point all time at tree.
It points where l tell it to.
It will point at you.
Chris, you can't.
You know it won't.
Squaw talk.
Arm yourself, Guyasuta.
This is the medicine of death.
Give him a knife, the tomahawk.
Not this one, one of the new steel ones of Garth's, a gun.
Now, little arrow, point to the chief of the Seneca.
Take it.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
Tell Sioto to make it turn from you if he can.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
Turn, arrow.
Point at white man.
The little arrow points only at you, Guyasuta.
Release the squaw.
Take her. Take her.
Guyasuta is once again a great chief.
No. No. Help.
Let her go. Let go.
Get out of here. Go on, go on.
Get away. Get away.
Get away. Go on. Get away.
Get out of here.
Don't fall. Keep your nerve.
I haven't much left.
Don't let them know it, we're not out of here yet.
Guyasuta, if your men follow before that arrow moves it will go right through your heart.
Keep going. Keep going.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN

Now get.
It's dawn. They'll be hunting us by daylight.
What can we do?
Die more comfortably.
Follow me.

Oh, Chris.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
Wolves.
There, my little nimrod, is your wolf.
Well, he had wolves for ancestors.
Hello, boy.
Hello, boy, hello, boy.
You all alone?
Where's your family?
They had to get out in a hurry. Look here.
"Injuns Riz.
Me and missus gone to Venango.
"You better get there too if you can read this.
Ben Salter."
We'd better get inside for the night.
What is it?
Clothes.
I wonder if Mrs. Salter would mind.
Well, l'm borrowing
Mr. Salter's shirt whether he minds or not.
Hey.
What's the matter?
Food. Beans.
Just like coming home.
Chris?
Yes.
What happened to the little dog?
Out chasing varmints, l guess.
We'll take him along with us to Ben Salter and his wife at Venango.
I wonder why they didn't take him.
"Benjamin Salter, his Bible."
I was thinking the Salters must have been very happy here.
Why?
It feels like it, doesn't it?
I guess so.
Back in London, l used to want to be a grand lady with carriages and mansions.
Maybe you will someday.
No.
Now l just want what the Salters have. This.
Was she very pretty?
Hmm?
Who?
The girl you bought the green dress for.
Oh, Diana.
I guess so.
Why didn't you marry her?
She liked someone else better.
Better than you?
She must have been crazy.
Good night, Chris.
Good night, Abby.
Hey, aren't you a little bit old to be playing with dolls, young fellow?
Hey, what's the matter?
What's troubling you, huh?
What do you got?
What do you got out there, a bear?
Well, all right, let's go get him.
Come on.
Say, you're bright-eyed and bushy-tailed this morning.
Hey, what's the matter?
What...
Chris? Chris?
Go back in the house, Abby.
Why? What are you doing?
Digging.
Look, good fit. Nice color.
What's this?
A doll.
The Salters won't be coming back, Abby.
They never left.
What do you mean?
Why is the dog...
Don't look.
No one has a chance in this wilderness.
Nobody can fight it.
It'll always be wilderness.
The savages will burn and torture and kill until they get it back.
Abby, get a couple of those sticks and tie them together for a cross.
People like the Salters can never be stopped, Abby.
The Indians can kill them and run them off, but more will keep coming.
The Salters are the New World, unconquered.
Unconquerable because they're strong and free, because they have faith in themselves, and in God.
Here, tie it together with this.
Chris. I need shoeing again.
Venango is just around the bend.
It is? Let's look.
Let's patch the moccasin first.
You mean Venango's goodbye.
Maybe.
You know, they can make a lot of trouble for runaway slaves.
Maybe we'd better call you Mrs. Holden.
Mrs. Holden?
Just for Venango, of course.
Of course. Just for Venango.
But then you may get to like the sound of it.
Might even want it for keeps.
Here.
Are you asking me to marry you?
Yes.
Try it on.
Because you're sorry for me.
I'm only sorry that it took to long to find you.
Hey, what are you crying about?
It's just that l'm so full of happiness it's...
It's overflowing.
What is it?
What are you looking at?
Vultures.
They had surrendered.
It's horrible.
What's that?
Pop, you're alive.
No, l ain't.
For three days, l been a-dying here, and you don't come along until l'm dead.
You've got lots of life, Pop.
Abby, get that canteen of water.
Don't get me no water.
I ain't that dead.
Prop me up.
I'm busted clean through.
How'd the Indians get in?
They walked in.
Chief Genowah, that mangy polecat.
Three times he comes to the fort with his white flag and his promises.
"Surrender," says he,
"and you'll all go free."
When the grub run out, everybody started yelping to run up the white flag.
I warned them, but nobody'd listen.
So they run up that danged white rag.
And all the folks went out, and them redsticks come a-hooting and a-shooting and massacred every last one of them under that white flag.
For three days, l've been trying not to die till some dang fool like you comes along, to warn Fort Pitt.
Fort Pitt.
You got long legs, get them a-going.
You can get down the river at night in a canoe.
Chris?
We're going east.
No, we're not.
That was just a dream we dreamed together for a little while.
We're going east.
There are 600 lives at Fort Pitt.
And Garth is one of them.
You're his, Abby.
If we go back, you go back to him.
We have no choice.
Of course, you ain't.
Get back to Fort Pitt.
Show them this flag.
Tell them what the redsticks is up to.
"Go free," they says.
"Take your people and your cattle.
"All we want is our hunting ground."
That's what he says,
"Take your people and your cattle.
"All we want is our hunting..."
"Go free.
"Take your people and your cattle.
"All we want is our hunting ground."
It's signed with Guyasuta's totem.
We're in a bad way, sir.
We've had no word yet from Colonel Bouquet's relief column.
Are you suggesting we surrender?
Put your weight on that.
I don't think much of our chances.
Then stop thinking.
Heat an iron, Dr. Boyd.
This arrow may have been poisoned.
Tell Guyasuta this is our home and we will defend this ground till the last warrior lies under it.
I'll send my wife with your message,
Captain Ecuyer, but after two months of siege, you've only a few days' provisions.
I just told you...
Get out, get out, both of you.
You'll kill this man.
Captain Steele, you are in command.
Yes, sir.
What's going on here? At ease.
What are you doing with that rope?
We're raising a ghost.
I hope it's a scout from Bouquet.
Oh, Chris, where in blazes did you come from?
I'm sure glad to see you breathing.
Go down and give Abby a boost.
Sure.
We didn't expect you'd come this way again,
Captain Holden.
I have a report for Captain Ecuyer, sir.
Captain Ecuyer is wounded.
I am in command.
There's been treachery at Fort Venango, sir.
Treachery?
That's a strange word from you.
You were under orders to burn the town of Pittsburgh and report back to Captain Ecuyer, were you not?
Yes, sir.
John, let her stand on your shoulders.
You're under arrest for desertion in the face of the enemy.
But, sir...
Mr. Hutchins, disarm him.
That elusive little bond slave will be held as a material witness until the court martial.
I don't believe this cock-and-bull story that Venango surrendered.
Bone here got through.
He says the fort still stands.
Captain Holden is obviously trying to protect himself and this girl.
The Mohawk Trail to Albany and Boston is what they were headed for, and the Indians drove them back.
That's probably Indian blood on this flag.
No, gentlemen, you need more proof than the word of a deserter.
We came back to save your fool necks.
Because there's a Judas here who won't stop until this flag flies over this fort and you're all dead beneath it.
Captain Holden is out of order.
Attacking Mr. Garth will not alter the record.
Return to your seat.
Proceed.
Was the accused headed for he Mohawk Trail and Boston?
What difference does it make?
You're all going to pay a terrible price for not believing us.
Confine yourself to the question.
Was he trying to escape with you to Boston?
I won't answer that.
You must answer.
She needn't.
We were heading for the Mohawk Trail to Albany and Boston.
I submit to the court the prisoner has admitted desertion.
Upon consideration of the matter before it, this court finds the accused guilty of desertion in the face of the enemy.
In accordance with the articles of war, prisoner will be stripped of his military rank and held in confinement until the firing party will execute the sentence of death.
Remove the prisoner.
The runaway bond slave will be returned to her lawful master, Mr. Garth.
Go back to the women's quarters.
You bring white one.
You tried to burn her at the stake.
Your tongue is forked.
I'm through with you.
The firelight's very becoming to that red hair, Abby.
I really should thank Holden for saving you for me, if the firing squad gives me time.
No.
For me, or for you?
For me.
I don't want you to die.
I want you to live.
You can't force me to live any more than you can force me to love.
You belong to me.
You don't want me as a slave.
No, l want you to come to me of your own free will.
I'll come to you of my own free will.
Abby.
Nothing for nothing's given here.
What do you want?
A word from you can open doors.
Sentries can be missing, a guard looking the other way.
You want Chris Holden's life.
Let him go tonight.
Give him his chance to live, and l'll be here.
That stubborn fool would rather die in the morning than leave without you.
He'll go.
It'll be just you and me, alone?
I promise.
(WHISPERS) Chris. Chris.
Abby. How did you... l've been saying goodbye to you over and over again for hours.
Seeing you doesn't make it any easier.
Here.
How did you...
You can get away through the sally port tunnel.
Did someone push the sentry in the river?
Time's running out.
Where's the guard?
You still have friends.
No, this way.
Isn't that door locked?
It will open.
John Fraser?
Find the relief column.
Tell Colonel Bouquet how desperate things are here.
No sentry at the sally port either.
Fraser must have bribed the whole garrison, or did he?
Don't question me, Chris, just go.
Are you going with me?
I'm staying here.
Fraser didn't open these doors, Abby.
Get the relief here, Chris.
Don't let Fort Pitt become another Venango.
You opened them.
You and l died together back there at Venango.
There'll be a mug of rum for every hole in his carcass.
You'll need a keg, Mr. Garth.
These men are possum hunters.
Watch the moat by the sally port tunnel there.
Something moving.
I'll send your keg of rum to the barracks.
Abby?
This one, wife.
You'll go back to your father.
The one you tried to kill will be my wife.
White one love Holden man.
Holden is dead.
Not dead.
He was shot crossing the moat.
No.
This one.
Hannah.
Holden man bring white chief, many, many soldier.
Little fool, why did you do it?
This one wife.
MAN 1: Fire attack on the...
MAN 2: Bucket brigade!
Bucket brigade!
MAN 3: How many men?
MAN 4: Get that roof wet!
Come on. Come on.
Start some this way.
The south barrack's on fire.
Steady there, steady.
WOMAN: Gotta keep moving.
You gotta keep these buckets moving.
Get down.
Here you are.
Hold on to it.
Water wouldn't do you no harm.
Get this fire out.
Hey, Ma, look.
Injuns coming up on that ledge.
You get in the house.
Oh, Ma.
Run along when you're told.
Kill him, Jeremy. Kill him.
Load with chain shot.
Here.
Throw a bunch at them.
Throw it, Jeremy. Throw it!
They can't wait,
Colonel Bouquet.
Fort Pitt can't last three days.
I won't leave my wounded here, and l can't advance a yard till the artillery comes up.
But you can't throw away the 600 lives in Fort Pitt.
Chris.
Captain, l have lost a quarter of my men here at Bushy Run.
Do the Indians know that, sir?
I pray they don't.
If we can make them think...
Think what, Chris?
Send this dispatch back to Legonnier.
Yes, sir.
Colonel, can you give me 100 men?
A hundred?
I can spare 20.
Those men out there.
What?
Give me those men, Colonel, and some wagons.
Are you mad, Chris?
Those men are dead.
And your drums and pipers, and 10 of your Black Watch.
It can't be done, but go ahead and try it.
Whatever is left of us won't be far behind you.
You are hungry.
Steady.
No powder for gun.
Put white flag on pole.
Take your people, go back safe over mountain.
Guyasuta, you can save your breath to run from
Colonel Bouquet's soldiers.
MAN 1: Ain't that an army musket?
MAN 2: Yeah, a Brown Bess.
MAN 3: Ain't one of ours.
The 42nd.
The Kilties.
It's their flag, the Black Watch.
Where'd they get it?
It's the 42nd for sure.
Do you suppose they...
Quiet.
'Tis a Highland bonnet all right.
Where do you suppose they got it?
From the Highlanders.
No mistaking that coat.
I tell you it's a trick.
Bouquet soldier dead.
Chris.
Don't believe the lying varmints.
I come no more.
White flag not on pole when time stick burn there, all die.
Mama.
Hush, dear.
We'll hold our fire exactly six minutes.
That means attack.
Post what additional men you have on the higher bastion.
This birch bark will burn fast.
MAN: Detail dismissed.
Captain Ecuyer should make this decision.
He's a sick man.
You'd better decide for yourself or they'll decide for you.
Where's the relief they promised us?
I say surrender and hoist this flag.
You're yellow, Bone.
We gotta keep on fighting, and anybody that don't think so, pick up that rag.
Why, you.
Mr. Fraser, give me that flag.
Captain Steele.
Hey.
Don't let them hoist this flag.
Hear them war drums?
They'll stop in a minute, then hang onto your hair.
And hang on tight.
Over there,
Grant and his Highlanders were massacred and scalped.
And over there,
Braddock's whole command was massacred.
MAN: But we're stronger.
Now Bouquet is wiped out at Bushy Run.
Will you make
Fort Pitt the next?
MAN: He's right.
The Indians know and all these people know, that your last chance died with the massacred relief column.
MAN: We can't fight with sticks.
What do you say,
Captain Steele?
I ain't aiming to surrender.
We got no chance.
WOMAN: There's the kids to think of.
My wife and me aim to fight it out.
With what, broom sticks?
Quiet. Quiet.
As a soldier, l'd fight.
But as a man responsible for the lives of these women and children, l feel compelled to accept the enemy's terms.
Captain, no. Don't raise it.
I saw the white flag at Venango stained with the blood of people like these who believed the Indians.
I'll vouch for the Indians.
I saw it, Captain.
Raise this flag at the gate staff.
There's plenty of us who'd rather fight, sir.
And l'm one of them.
Proceed, Mr. Hutchins.
MAN: Oh, we'll regret this.
Clark, we'll inform
Captain Ecuyer in his sick room.
Yes, sir.
Give up now, what chance have we got?
We give up, all them massacred folks died for nothing.
If my Joe was alive, he'd say,
"Keep fighting."
You hoist that flag and l'll shoot it down.
With what? An empty rifle?
Get it up, sonny, before we lose our scalps.
I'll have no truck with surrendering.
You ain't got three kids,
Jane Fraser. Get it up.
Garth vouches for the Indians.
Your last chance.
The time's up.
Do you hear?
The drums have stopped.
MAN: That's the signal.
WOMAN:
Get that flag up, quick.
Wait, young man.
Hold that flag.
It may be the wind.
It may be my wishing, but it sounds like the pipes of heaven itself.
I don't hear nothing.
Get it up.
Get it up or we'll all be hearing the pipes of heaven.
No, listen, you big ox.
JEREMY: Listen.
It is. It is.
Chris got through.
There they are.
I can see them.
How many do you see?
It's them.
It's the pipes of the 42nd.
That's Bouquet's column.
Bouquet.
MAN: Tear up that white flag.
GIRL: How many be there, Pa?
I don't know.
Ain't had time to count them yet.
That's the first time l've enjoyed the sound of a bagpipe.
I want to see them.
Come on, take him.
Try not to look as scared as l feel.
They cannot see the hair standing up beneath me bonnet.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
Chris. They're running.
They're running.
Run, you varmints, run.
So Bouquet was wiped out, was he?
Look at them Indians run.
Get to the stable and saddle up three horses.
Three?
I'm taking Abby.
And stock up three saddlebags. Move.
See them, Mr. Garth, ain't it grand?
If l had me a wife, l'd raise hallelujah.
I'll marry you.
Something's wrong with that column.
Looks awfully good to me, sir.
We'll head south into Cherokee country and build back from there.
We can go down the Mon side and hug the bank.
MAN: Hurry up with that bridge, soldier.
WOMAN: Glory be, you're a grand sight.
Chris. Chris, the stables.
Get to the stables.
MAN: Look at them.
Why are they so still,
Jeremy?
The gentlemen are dead.
We'll mount in here.
Hey.
They've stopped yelling.
Give her a hand up.
Chris.
Get over there, Bone.
That's far enough.
Stand clear, Abby.
She's coming with me.
Where you're going, you're going alone.
Let him have it, Bone.
HOLDEN: Bone won't shoot me.
BONE: I won't, huh?
No.
Abby, stand over there.
Because l'm the only one between you and the hangman's rope for double-selling a slave.
Fergus out there doesn't know you acted for Garth.
I do.
But you won't be talking.
Bone, turn your back and get your hands up on that ladder.
All right, Holden.
I'm not fool enough to try to beat you on the draw.
You win.
You can take my gun.
I know you wouldn't shoot a man in the back.
ABBY: Look out, Chris.
You are a better man than you are a soldier,
Holden.
You have earned a firing squad for deserting this fort.
And our gratitude for helping save it.
When Colonel Bouquet arrives, the frontier can start moving west again.
Move with it.
Captain Ecuyer.
What?
Would you... Could you...
Oh, yes, yes, of course.
Who stands for you?
Here, put it on.
Hold hands.
I pronounce you man and wife until you find a minister.
Marriage frees you from slavery, Mrs. Holden.
It won't do the same for you, sir.
You're sweet.
East or west, Abby?
Make it west.
And don't get caught by the Indians again.
Yes, sir.
Or anybody else. Stay free.
Yes, sir.
And close that door.

Give me that horse.
He couldn’t go on nor could you...
...you are injured man.
Let us take you into the house.
I gotta go on. to the Telegraph station.
We will take you.
Penelope!
Sorry, closed down for the night.
I know, but this is urgent...
No. Come out of there, you!
Can’t go against the schedule.
Closed down.
Can’t you make this one exception?
- No.
- get in here.
- What?
Bring a light with you.
You can’t do this to me.
I won’t stand for it!
...the Union of Pacific won’t stand for it.
Night prowling round here, like this.
You got your ball busted my office.
Who do you think you are anyway?
My keys closed down for tonight.
You can write it, but I won’t send it anyway.
Here let me!
Territorial Recorders office,
Fort Ladsy.
Stakes...
...on plots 234... 235.
Chart it anytime, record my name...
...that’s all.
- How shall I sign?
Quirt Evans.
All sent, Mr. Evans.
Why! He ain't dead? Is he?
No just knocked out!
That’s Quirt Evans...
Look at his gun, see how many notches he has got in his gun?
Not any that I can see sure ain’t going to touch it to find out might wake up and take it in the wrong way. he was deputy of Wyatt Earp in Tombstone.
...the two of them shot it out the whole Clanton bunch.
That’s Quirt Evans...
...he is quite a man with the gals...
.it says he closed the eyes of many a man
...wouldn’t rise of many women.
Would you call my father please?
Yes! Mam...
Where are you taking him?
- To the wagon, taking him home.
Quirt Evans?
Crazy!
I will have a black powder bomb in my house.
Heavy, ain’t he?
I know of a dozen men riding night and day
...to catch Quirt Evans helpless like this.
I am worried about you people...
...I know you don’t believe in guns or anything like that, only doing good
...take my advice
Stay pretty far away from Mr. Quirt Evans.
Thank you very much for your advice.
Goodnight.
Good night.
So long, Quirt.
That Quirt Evans is surely something.
Quirt Evans?
You know him?
Do I know Quirt Evans!
Do I know Quirt Evans?
What a question!
No... No...
If that doesn’t quiet him...
I don’t know what will?
...never get that bullet out of him kicking his arms like that.
I am afraid to give him any more sedative, he has already had enough.
Please be quiet... the doctor...
He can’t hear you.
What do you suppose that? delirious mind is searching for?
He must be in great pain
- Not that much with the amount of laud ram in him.
As if he was reaching for something.
Something specific.
I don’t understand.
By now he should be completely inert.
No.
Thomas, how is the young man?
- Delirious.
A gun in this house, Thomas?
Please put these back in the gun belt...
Maybe we got to get him something to tie him down.
Are you crazy?
- Its empty.
That was it. A Gun.
- Its a pity.
It’s stupid! These wild ones
I keep pulling bullets out of them
...and setting their bones, why?
It’s their destiny to wind up on boot hill.
No!
I forgot! Never speak evil, Eh!
Well, get me some more hot water young lady.
Start patching him up for whatever is in store for him?
Come on, help me with his boot.
Mother...
- Yes?
Tell me again.
What Dear?
- Oh, about meeting father?
You have heard that a thousand times.
He was working on the Rail road union house.
...he fell off, and I picked him up out of the dust and held him in my arm.
He always said that I hugged him before I even knew his name.
And you both knew right away?
- Of course.
Of course I knew he was a peaceful man....
...a member of the society.
An evil man will seek a more profitable way of life
...than being a member of the "Friends".
Father, had a beard then, didn’t he?
- Yes.
I should think that would scratch...
I prefer a man clean shaved.
He is got the constitution of a mountain lion.
He will pull through.
Barring blood poisoning.
These wild ones never seem to get blood poisoning...
...though it’s common enough among the Godly.
You so called Atheists. You always feel so compelled to stretch your Godlessness.
Wash him. The bullets out.
He is in no danger.
I bet he killed a lot of people.
- No, he didn’t.
How do you know?
- That’s enough, John...
...'friend' doesn’t speak of such things.
Mrs. Worth, get that man out of here.
But he is badly injured, doctor.
This isn’t civilized Pennsylvania...
...this is the raw frontier.
You must take a realistic attitude.
This is the place where mayhem, theft and murder are the common place...
...instead of the unusual.
Would that justify leaving a wounded man to die?
Build a house on the side of a road and tend to a man.
He who believes.
I don’t mind your mocking you have been a good friend to us.
I am glad I have a logical mind. and a good heart:
Goodnight, doctor.
Goodnight.
Still having delirious spells.
Keeps mumbling about his past.
...I am afraid he has had a very violent life.
Margaret you are a nuisance.
Let’s call it off, Margaret.
I have got places to go and country to put behind.
Sure, sure, alright.
Lila, Lila,
Lila,
Will you bring some hot coffee, Penny?
Here the doctor says that he is completely out of danger.
Just sleeping
You know Doctor...
...Penny considers him her own personal patient.
-Sit down.
Will you bring some milk dear?
And when you finish you can go up and watch him
He doesn’t need watching. He has no temperature in the past few days.
...just a superlatively healthy animal.
...restoring his depleted strength with sleep.
He is no longer delirious.
But of course, if you are determined to watch over him, Penny...
...perhaps you better take a pencil and paper with you.
...his first conscious words should be recorded.
It may be of great interest to history.
And more possibly to the united states martial.
Who knows what violence is involved in his battered bruises and bullet holes.
Would you care foe a donut, doctor?
It is not as light as it should be.
- Listen Mrs. Worth...
...you can carry this head in sand attitude just so far in the world of reality.
...let me get this man out of your house.
I can dump him in an establishment that passes for a hotel.
...in this off times dubious community of ours.
In Madame sanitary halo?
- Then he will be off your hands.
But he is much better off here
- Of course he is.
Who cares what happens to him?
- We do
I don’t know what to say?
Once when I was studying medicine in Europe...
...I had a friend, an artist.
...he drew portraits of people and made them resemble like animals that reminded him.
...he would have drawn this man as a coiled cobra.
Doctor, your analogies terribly imperfect and your naturalism faulted.
Cobras don’t coil
Doctor, we are so fond of you and we respect you so greatly...
... We assure you that you will finally realize
...that realism untempered by sentiments of humanity
...is really just a mean hard cold outlook on life.
...a frightened outlook.
I stand defeated.
And furthermore there are times in this house...
...that I am living in a never never land.
But don’t hesitate to call on me anytime you need help.
Hello.
You are awake?
- Sure, I am awake.
What is all this?
- What?
Where am I?
Don’t you remember? Father and I drove young into town.
Is anything wrong?
- No.
The doctor says you will be alright in a week or two
You were delirious you know?
Two days and two nights
Oh maybe that’s why I am so hungry
I can eat yearlings too...
...if I can catch one
We will get you something.
Mother!
You talked a lot in your deliria.
Mother, he is awake.
- How is he?
Hungry!
- If he is hungry, he is going to be alright.
Thanks a lot for housing.
- You are welcome.
Smoked sausages and eggs?
Sounds great.
- 2 eggs or would you like 3?
I would like 6.
- You shall have them.
Penny, get one of your fathers shirt here.
And a razor.
I will get him some food...
So I talked a lot.
- Yes.
I listened only because I thought that you might say something about what happened to you.
...as to notifying your wife for instance.
What did I say?
- If you had a wife.
What did I talk about?
You talked about Margaret, she...
...fell out of the red dress...
What else?
Oh, you mentioned someone named Lila.
Is that all?
If you have a wife
We could notify her.
No wife.
That’s 12.
I haven’t been so flattered since my donuts won first prize back in Pennsylvania.
They must be smart in Pennsylvania.
Some of the members thought its an exhibition of pride to enter my donut.
But what harm can there be in a little donut...
...unless, one eats so many of them, they explode, which is likely to happen to you, young man.
...well its worth wise to check it out.
I will help you with the dishes.
- No, you stay and watch Quirt Evans.
I am curious to know the effect of 6 eggs and a pound of sausage and 12 donuts.
I will call you in the time of milking.
Do all you people from Pennsylvania
Talk like that?
Like what?
Thee.
We are 'friends'.
Friend of who?
- Of all.
The society of 'Friends'.
Many people call us 'Quakers'.
Oh! It’s a religion.
- Its a belief.
That on the wall... each human being has an integrity that can be hurt only
...by the act of the same human being. and not by the act of another human being.
Is that Quaker stuff?
You mean nobody can hurt you but yourself?
That’s what the 'Friends' believe.
Well suppose somebody whacks you over the head by a branding iron...
...will that hurt?
- Physically, of course.
But in reality, it will injure only the person doing the act of violence.
Only a door can be hurt by an evil or mean act.
Are there many of you Quakers?
- Very few.
Sort of figured that.
Good morning gentlemen.
- Good morning.
Carrot from our garden.
I found these down at the road. It belongs to a fella named Quirt Evans.
I understand you are a friend of his, maybe you can help us to give them back...
Leave it here. I will make sure that he gets them.
That Quirt, he will loose his shirt unless it is buttoned on.
...careless about everything.
I keep telling him, sooner or later.....
On second thoughts you can just tell me where he is, and..
I can take it back to him, myself.
Where is Quirt Evans?
You mean where is he?
Ever notice how fella keep repeating the question, just when he is stalli8ng about answering.
Yeah! Maybe if I bend this gun over his head he will quit stalling.
But gentlemen, I hardly know Quirt Evans.
He lies too.
You have been bragging all over town of what good friends you two are.
You know, this fella hasn’t got any good qualities, has he?
Maybe that will help your memory
I am asking about Quirt Evans.
Well all I know is...
Thanks for sewing my shirt...
...but I can’t find my pants.
Get back in bed.
Laziness is the necessary things that kept me here this long.
The doctor said that you are to stay in bed for 4 more days.
Oye, you are up.
That’s no way to speak to an older person, John.
We are pals...
...you don’t expect pals to call me Mister,
Would you?
See, doctor send me tell you that some men in town are looking for you.
..Said one of them is Mister Laredo Stevens.
Get my pants.
- But you are ill.
Johnny, get me my pants.
- No, John.
Will he get my pants?
Get the pants, John.
But you said,
What are you looking at?
- Thee.
What set him off?
The use of familiar speaking to.
- The what?
The Familiar, the plain language.
'Get me my pants, you said'
What about it?
Oh, among us, thee and the are used
Only among the loved ones.
...to all others, we use
You, he, and they
...mother to children, husband to wife and children to...
Between lovers of course.
I am sorry.
- I am not.
What?
- I am not! I wished you would speak to me.
Well.
I knew right away.
That night.
Supposed to be a kind of dull life.
I could take you at lot of places...
I go.
- What?
I would rather stay here with thee
But if thee rather go someplace else, then I go someplace else.
I sound very bold?
Well, it’s just that...
...I didn’t think religious people were quite so, sudden and direct...
Well that’s the way I feel and it would be dishonest to say anything else.
Yeah!
I used to wonder about it,
I suppose every girl does.
About what?
About love......
About whether or not you got to know someone whom you know a little by little
...or it happened at once...
You are shocked....
Well, I wouldn’t say shocked exactly....
...you sure get to the point.
- should I be different?
No, Penny, I like you just the way you are.
Who emptied this gun?
- Father
Quirt, a gun is a symbol of force, evil.
We never have one in our home.
It’s a concession that father allowed even an empty one.
It’s only because you couldn’t rest without....
- Where are the cartridges?
Outside.
Hey! Why don’t we just bust in?
Because busting through doors with
Quirt Evans on the other side,
...ain’t my idea of a healthy past time.
Tell them to come in.
Come in.
You can stand right there.
...against the light.
Howdy, Quirt.
You sure ran a ring around me alright.
I don’t think it was right friendly of you to beat me
..to locating that land after my boys found it.
I am willing to listen to your side, but
I am a reasonable man.
Sure, Laredo is always reasonable
That’s why he is the biggest man in the territory.
You are the biggest man in the territory, Laredo?
So a lot of people say.
- I hadn’t heard.
You nervous?
- No, Evans.
I can’t figure out, why you keep stepping on my toes all the time...
Well, that’s your business.
I am a good loser
...I like a good loser.
Course I like any kind of good loser better than a winner.
...yeah!
You know I had a chance to do a heap of thinking while I was following your trail across the territory.
I followed it by the string of ran out horses you left behind....
Well, I figured it out this way.
...Quirt, didn’t really want that land.
... Because working isn’t exactly in his line.
Is it in your line?
- No, of course not. I was getting it for another fella.
And well, I figured maybe you will sell.
I don’t hear anything jingle.
Is it alright to put my hand inside my shirt?
Why not?
5.000 in gold there.
I want 20.
Well okay, but I have to owe you 15, that’s all I got on me.
I have the deed in my pocket, here
- get it out.
Now, if the young lady could find something to sign this with.
Still Laredo's hired boy, eh, Hondo?
Thicking up after him carrying matches for his cigars.
You mind yourself.
- He will mind himself...
... Wont you Hondo?
- Miss...
..Would you mind taking this over to Mister Evans please?
Thank you.
You know, I am sure glad to see you up and around, Quirt...
...we heard you just got it in the back.
Sorry to disappoint you.
And you come on over and get the rest of that money anytime.
Anytime, that you feel you are able.
I will see you one of these days.
Well, so long, Quirt.
Saddle up my horse. Will you kid?
Throw some bags.
What would have happened if they knew that the gun was empty?
It would have been Saturday night in sin city.
Tie on my slicker too.
Sorry.
- Oh, no, Quirt, no.
Kind of a bored you think I am.
You can’t do that. We would have tended any wounded human, and not for pay.
You don’t believe in force, so you cannot force me to take it back.
I am afraid you are outwitted, Thomas.
How long I have been here?
- Almost 3 weeks.
And I hate to get going.
But you can’t. Your leg!
You are in no condition to travel.
Don’t worry; your cookies have grained me up and ready for market.
Adios, amigos.
Quirt.
Shall I pack my things?
Why?
- You would leave without me?
I got places to go...
Quirt, I don’t care, it doesn’t make any difference to me... or how far...
I know so little... I.....
...I didn’t know that it could happen to one and not the other.
..I thought it always happen to both.
It isn’t?
Well...
- So you do feel..?
Look, Penny...
...I am not that kind of guy who does things suddenly.
I gotta look before I leap.
You can ask anybody, they will tell you.
...Quirt Evans is a mighty cautious citizen.
Oh then, it’s just that you are not sure yet?
Yeah! Sorry.
Please stay.
It’s all saddled, Quirt.
Unsaddle it.
You gonna stay?
A double!
Well there is something that I rather have than this.
A favor. A big favor.
- Well, you got them both. What is it?
Could you ride past my schoolhouse with me?
Because a lot of boys will not believe that I know Quirt Evans.
Sure.
Everybody says that you are the fastest man in the territory.
Well, there are those
Who will say I am pretty slow.
A mans should be able to do a good days work after having breakfast like that.
I would see that he would do it...
Penny, where is the bucket?
I declare Penny,
I don’t know whets happening to thee.
Funny thing about pan cakes
...I lose my appetite after the first couple of dozens.
They are not very good this morning,
They are too heavy.
Wild Indian... put water on those vegetables this morning.
I always working round here.
Thee wanted to be a farmer didn’t thee?
Not any more, I don’t...
Surely you could walk to the barn without that.
What?
- The gun.
It balances me; one leg is longer than the other.
...you know the weight.
- Thee are a liar.
Throw the cows some hay.
There is a pitch fork.
While I was 15, I learnt to hate those things.
...I swore I would leave flower and pitch forks to farmers.
I will do it.
No, I will do it.
But it’s an occasion.
Thee...
- What?
Nothing... just... just thee.
Penny!
Why you wanted hay, didn’t you?
Didn’t Thee?
Better put this little one's in the box
Now get a bucket of water.
Water, water. All I do is carry water.
No force.
Say, wasn’t this place a little drained?
With all these flumes and ditches.
Frederick Carson turned the water off.
Frederick Carson?
He is the man who bought the ranch from friends who couldn’t make a go over
We had built a community dam, but...
It was on his property.
What did you do about it?
Don’t tell me. You prayed.
Of course.
- get any water?
We didn’t pray for water.
We prayed for Frederick Carson.
Carson turned off the water and you prayed for him?
Of course.
Can’t you see? By committing an evil act the poor man injured his soul?
Be glad there is a well.
Cause it sure gets thirsty around here
...if we had to wait for Carson.
Gonna walk this pony.
Penny.
Nothing.
You sure you haven’t left any slack on that cinch?
Boss is sure going to howl...
This ain’t the first pony I ever saddled.
...he would squawk no matter
How I done it.
He is sure getting mean these days.
You can take it as his natural born. that boil in his neck don’t help him none either.
Get out of my way.
You belong behind a plough.
Who is Carson?
Don’t get down. We ain’t taking no saddle tramps here.
Are you deaf?
I said get moving.
Nice dam.
- Yeah, whets it up to you?
Take out the top two planks.
What did you say?
The top two. There are 16 inches of water over there.
Who says so?
- I do.
And who might you be when you are at home?
Quirt Evans.
Well anybody might ride up here and say he is Quirt Evans.
He is not known round here by sight.
Anybody can say that he is him.
Sure could.
There is a Q. E. stamp on his saddle.
Well take that top planks out of the gate you stupid idiots.
I don’t need that extra water.
Step up on that pony.
Why is that?
I have done what you have told me.
You sure did.
Step up on that pony.
Well, I am that kind of guy who tries to get along with everybody? side me.
- wait a minute.
Sure can be taking off couple of more planks cause I have 10 times much water than I need.
That will do for now.
Well, if you ever need more, Mr. Evans, all you have to do is say so...
I figured that...
Hey! Mummy, water!
Water, water!
Mother, look at the flow.
Mother all the ditches are full of water.
Water! Water!
Wonderful!
Thomas!
Let’s start off from the scratch...
...you got more water than you need.
You are right, Quirt,
I mean Mr. Evans.
Do you mind if I call you Quirt?
Not a bit...
There is no skin off your marks if you let a little water over that ditch.
Absolutely no Mr. Evans...
I mean, Quirt.
You are going to be neighborly or not?
- Well, sure I am, Quirt.
That’s the way to talk.
Thomas!
Frederick Carson.
- Howdy, Mrs. Worth.
We always knew that you will change your mind.
Yes Mam, I did.
Thank you Frederick, all of us here in the valley are grateful to you.
Well, it’s like just what I was saying, I ain’t got any use of that extra water...
Why shouldn’t let my neighbors use it?
I believe that neighbors should be friendly.
What have you got that on your neck?
A boil?
Mrs. Worth, I have been with that burnt boil...
- have you tried putting soap into it.
No, Mam. I ain’t.
You get down for a minute and into the house and I will fix it for you.
You are going to hurt me?
- No...That’s a shame... it looks awful.
Well, looks like your prayer straightened everything out.
So you think your gun changed
Frederick Carson?
Who says I pointed a gun?
I do.
- Well, I didn’t.
He gave in more easily than I expected.
Remember this quote:
"The lord moves in mysterious manner...
...at times using strange methods in our instruments."
Me?
It would be odd.
I just got a good high after a good pie and truckload of...
Frederick Carson.
- yes Mam?
I want you to have some of these,
They are awfully good with coffee in the morning.
Makes me to go home and shoot my Chinese cook.
You just come back for more, anytime you like
There are always plenty.
Thanks.
- Goodbye.
Goodbye, Frederick.
- Goodbye.
I should see more of these neighbors.
Wonderful woman Mrs. Worth...
She fixed my boil.
- Penny!
Excuse me. But I think father wants to give thanks...
You know, he already thanked me?
I know, but now, he wants to thank someone else.
Hold my pondering when I get aboard.
Will you?
Mrs. Worth is going to keep me supplied with pies
... I ought to bring her a quarter of beef now and then.
Finally, come to an understanding with my neighbors.
You sure did.
Oh! You knew I was scare to death, when I made that speech to them people.
...I am glad you made me do it.
Makes me feel good.
Adios, amigo.
Dinner.
How the dinner is going to be?
Roast vegetables and of course skimpy chicken.
With the pie and cake I will try to make out.
Chicken is innocent.
- Both. I feel real good.
Oh, you do?
New dress.
Oh! Its first day.
You call it Sunday.
Quirt, do me a favor, hitch up the ponies for father.
Sure.
Can you do me another favor?
Go for a ride with us.
- Where?
You are not to ask,
It’s a surprise, a pleasant one.
Quirt, we gotta surprise for you.
He knows, I told him.
Though you aren’t allowed to work on Sundays.
Quirt, there is nothing with
...its just we don’t believe in doing what we know is wrong.
That makes it pretty much
"Each fellas own guess".
Each fell knows, inside.
I wouldn’t wanna give lead
I didn’t mean to frighten you, miss.
Is a fella named Quirt Evans around here?
Yes, I will get him.
Never mind.
I can do talking to you.
Is he been here long?
About 3 weeks I guess.
He didn’t disappear for say
2 days, during that time, did him?
No.
- Hola, you weather hang man...
Penny, this is Wistful Mclintock... the martial of the territory.
Hiya Miss!
Don’t let that grey hair fool you.
He is curly wolf.
Hello, Quirt. I thought I had you butt home.
Tall fella. Fast with a gun held up the 'Backers' stage. Killed a couple.
Well, you are tall and some say you are a fast man.
..but I guess, I will have to take the little lady's word for it.
When you and Laredo Stevens are going to kill each other?
Laredo?
We water our horses out of the same traught...
Well, I am sure, they are looking forward to hang the survivor.
You know, I am a figuring man...
...sometimes I don’t know all the answers....
...like that fella
'Quirt Evans'...
...while he was acting as Wyatt Earp's deputy
Over in Tombstone
...one day turns in his badge and starts to build himself up a nice cattle spread.
Suddenly sells out and he goes out in a pry.
...why? That’s what I ain’t figured out yet.
Sometimes things connect.
About that time a fella, called 'Wall Ennis’...
...went down in front of
Laredo Stevens...
...'Wall' was reaching his gun, some say a gambler standing there grabbed his hand....
...maybe that’s connected...
How do you stand with Wall?
I know him.
Two things connected?
I know a lot of people.
Well, I will figure it out...
...I usually do.
I am patient.
Young lady, don’t be looking at him with your eyes bugged out as a cow barge.
...there ain’t any future on it.
So long folks.
Quirt, please stay away from Laredo Stevens.
He owes me money.
And don’t worry I might come out on top.
That will be even worse.
Worse! Will it be worse if he goes down than I go down?
Of course, don’t you see?
Oh, I will be a guy with a mud soul.
Don’t make it sound so crude, Quirt, you see why I couldn’t love you.
Alright I won’t lookup Laredo.
Its better this way
...every time he opens his door, every time he hears footsteps coming round the corner...
...Laredo starts sweating thinking its me.
...his food won’t set for the rest of his life.
Well alright, if I am going to be holy
I gotta get some fun out of it.
You know I feel like such a
It seems hardly a whole week since last Thursday.
Hey Quirt.
I thought it was you.
Well, well, well
- Hello.
Mister and Mrs. Worth,
Randy McCall.
How do you do
- How do you do?
Just fine, thank you.
Well, well, well...
- You said that before.
We don’t want to keep you if you are in a hurry.
I have got no hurry. I have got no place to go.
- Well, we have.
Would you care you come along with us.
- Sure, where?
A meeting.
- To a meeting?
Yes, to a meeting.
You don’t wanna go do you?
It would be nice if he could.
- Its nice to have any of Quirt's friends.
You would? Well that’s fine.
You know Mam...
I am sure an old friend of Quirt.
I remember one time we were chasing cattle down the Lawanda river...
...herd stampeded, Quirt pulled me out from underneath it.
And there was another time remember?
In Opus Palace, down at San Antonio.
We are late.
- I know, but...
Good bye.
If you can join us it is in the grope, just on the other side of the town.
Thank you Mam.
- Good day.
Get along.
- Good day.
He sayeth onto him "which?"
And God said...
"Though shall not kill ...
...though shall not steal...
...though shall not bear false witness...
...honor thy father and thy mother...
And though shall treat the neighbors as though themselves.
Whets comes out of this thing that makes it worth all this work?
Frozen pudding.
Hello, Nelson.
- Hello, Penny.
Nelson, meet Quirt Evans.
- How do you do?
- Howdy.
Nelson's our horse shoeer.
By the way I brought that maple sugar that you love so much.
Oh, excuse me, I will put it here.
- Thank you.
Isn’t this the Morgan baby?
- Yes, I am minding her.
She is sure a cute little fella.
Looks just like his father.
I will be coming up next week to see the horses.
Fine.
I will get some water.
- Here, let me help you.
Hold this thing.
Frozen pudding.
Hold them a minute,
I want some of those flowers.
Sick or something?
I don’t believe it.
It’s a baby.
- Yeah, I know.
Old enough to talk?
- Of course not.
I got something I think
You would like to hear.
Laredo Stevens is planning a big play.
...he is going to jump up some guys that are moving a trail herd up from the north.
I figured, it may be you, me and couple of friends can sort of play copycat.
You heard me, didn’t you?
You can have my part of it.
What am I listening to?
You passing up a chance to blister Laredo?
That’s right.
What’s the matter with you Quirt?
Is the farm life...
Oh, the gem....
Stick in your head into this butt and I will shut you up.
You are awful touchy lately... you never used to mind what I said.
Hello.
- Hey.
Come along with the water, Quirt.
Shut up.
Quirt, would you come over here?
Sit down.
May I have your attention?
Friends, we all know the purpose of this meeting is three fold.
...as always we give thanks to the goodness bestowed upon us.
...and also to give thanks for particular that our fields are getting water.
... and the crops and the livestock’s thrive.
There is two marsh mellows right at the top of the valley.
...if you take a look from out there
You can see a herd coming from 10 miles.
...Quirt Evans.
Friends...
We are happy to present you with the token of our friendship for you.
This is 'Quirt Evans'.
We are happy to have him here with us, because he provided us another incident
...which reaffirms our belief...
...that all men are good if they are shown the light.
He persuaded 'Frederick Carson' to let down the water...
...by showing him, that a man who is a friend of another friend... is a happy man himself.
May I shake your hands, Quirt Evans?
I want to talk to you.
This would sound like I am butting into your business and I am.
And you are going to give me a watch with gold case for doing it.
You dim witted nail binder!
You marry that girl.
Marry her? Why sure you mind her telling
She knows how I feel.
How would she know?
Stop yelling about shoeing horses that ain’t the way to talk to a girl.
Talk to her about her.
And marry her. And do it quick.
Hey!
- come on.
Listen to this.....
Oh, brother this is good writing.
- Lets go.
What about the Bible?
You can’t throw it away,
That would be bad luck.
Then keep it.
Alright. Its one book,
I am sure going to read.
I would better take her to the Morgan's.
Why did Quirt leave so abruptly?
I don’t know...
Hey boss!
- Yeah?
They are right on time.
Look behind you.
Let’s saddle up men.
Let’s get out of here.
Look! Coming down off the hill.
Come on...
Quirt, what does beget mean?
I think I hear them.
Yeah!
- Lets get suited up.
They don’t know how would I miss this book.
You know you not very pretty. But I like it just the same. Your plenty of head works.
Much nicer this way....
No! Anybody can just shoot these guys.
...you think of an interesting way of doing it.
...and you know Quirt!
I hate to shoot people.
Remember I shot a man once on Montana?
I dreamed about it, all the next night.
Well then of course, there were no witnesses. else you gotta shoot the witnesses.
Stop jabbering and let’s go.
- Okay, take it easy pal.
Again I figured you may change your mind about shooting Laredo along with these guys.
Step up on that horse.
- Okay, you got it.
Maybe you are just crowding Laredo into drawing in front of a lot of people.
Gonna saving him for the big night
In town, eh!
Hey... look!
Let’s go.
Take it on the outside.
Start tearing, Laredo.
Let’s go.
Looks like the horse of Quirt Evans...
Yeah! It’s just what it is.
This time we face...
- Yeah! I know...
With those boots and see if you can run him down.
You know that champagne maybe lot more fancy than whisky.
..But sure it don’t give you quick action.
To tell you the truth.
I don’t really like it. It’s very fashionable.
How do you like it?
Tickles going down and its expensive.
So I like it.
You sleepy Tommy?
- No.
25 hot one on the red.
Place tag on the blues.
‘There is something in your eyes...
..That look a little bit different.
Something that appeals to me.
I love the way they change up the angels
Always full of mystery.
There is something in your smile that are a little bit different...
Something I have been looking for ...
If I can just be sure that you are on the level..
...I would never ask for more.
I thank for a little bit of feeling
...First time we met..
17 odd in black.
17, there goes the last button of my shirt.
Alright buddy, you wanna have another ride?
Going on 17?
Cash me in.
Place your bets.
“Something that I never knew...”
In every way.
...you are just a little bit different...
That’s why I love you
Thanks you for the money, daddy.
I hope....
Bourbon large glass.
There are plenty of rooms on either side...
But you had come bullying in between us ?
I didn’t see you...
You interrupted a very important discussion on serious matters regarding big things.
...me and my brothers don’t like it.
Gentlemen, gentlemen... no trouble please.
We just put the place back together after the last difference in opinion..
...gentlemen, more over the breakage and the overhead. Mainly the breakage.
I had a dreadful time keeping body and soul together
What I think is going to happen...
Happens...
Here is your trip.
What’s eating you Tall man? you had words with those Baker brothers?
Who?
- Those 4
No.
Told around they are quarrelsome citizens.
Gentlemen, lets consider the incident closed.
Watch out tempers.
Maybe I would go and apologies.
More whisky.
I will be right back, I hope.
Where have you been?
- well Randy always on a trip.
You don’t know what are you doing to me...
Please... I got a large family.
Hey, wait a minute it’s me.
Billy, get him.
That’s my old friend, Billy.
Come on get him... come on get hold of him.
Go on, you got him.
You got him.
Thanks.
I must have hit the wrong man.
Hey
- Sorry, Quirt. How are you doing?
Don’t worry about me.
Come on.
You wait outside. Check them and count them as we throw them out.
Its getting less.
Oh honey, I was so afraid
You would get hurt.
Its wonderful.
We have money, whisky and lovely ladies. and just had a beautiful fight.
...I tell you, we would really ought a be thankful
You have been reading that bible again
- Yes.
That’s something I never thought I would see.
- What?
A Bible with your name on it.
Now where would you get a bible?
Quirt!
Penny, what is wrong with you?
Table cloths don’t belong in there.
Oh, I am sorry.
Quirt.
Unsaddle my horse.
Will you kid ?
Sure.
Wanna a boarder for a while?
Of course. You are always welcome
- Quirt!
Hello!
I didn’t had a decent meal since I left here. Chocolate?
Not very good, the flour you know.
I will just stick around till you get it right.
I feed the chickens.
- So early, Penny?
Yes. Can you help me Quirt?
Does it take two to feed a few chickens, mother?
At times, Thomas, at times. remember?
You came back?
Yes.
Why?
I don’t know exactly.
Why did you go away without saying anything ?
I don’t know exactly about tat either.
I think it’s because I frightened you.
I know that sounds strange that I could frighten you, but .....
...but I mean it
You were frightened because I was stupid ....
...you thought that living with me will be tiresome ..
..and dull after a while.
Tiresome and dull because....
...all I knew, raised since a baby.. here among the farmers I believe ..
...that people love, marry, and stay together for ever after that
I am not such a fool not to know that in outside world there's people  ..
...it doesn’t have to follow that they marry and stay together for ever.
I know that sometimes they separate.
Are you ever going to run down and let me talk ?
No, Quirt, that’s what you were afraid of that I tie myself around your neck ..
...and when you get tired you couldn’t get rid of me ..
I made up my mind that if you come back
I will tell you this.
...whatever you want,
Quirt, you can be...
If I go away you go with me.
If I go away,
Thee go away.
I used to be an Indian fighter.
See you cant help walking up soft on people..
Morning missy...
This young man doing any trouble since I was here last?
A fellow over Castleway lost a big herd of cattle a few days ago.
Well, missy... Cat got your tongue?
Why ask her?
You know I have been traveling.
You look at my coral to see how my horse shaped up ..
I did just that...
You sure covered a lot of country.
Its a rightly weary animal..
I just want to see with the young lady live for you.
I was going to..
You have been over to Castleway?
I have been to Rinrock and I got witnesses to prove it.
Witnesses! For instance ?
Randy McCall, Christine Taylor.
That’s what I call witnesses?
Who else?
Lila Neal, I suppose
She would make a good alibi witness for you.
Randy, Christine and Lila...
...there's three to draw to
So Lila saw you there too?
Yes.
Come here, junk head...
You hay jumper...
Guess its a mystery here, Quirt.
...but I am patient..
...that’s what hangs all you fellows in the end.
...I am patient.
Lila?
You talked about her when you were in delirious.
There is a sight
I never thought I would see.
Quirt Evans behind a plough.
The pony walks as soft as you do.
I taught him
Oh, I figured you should have heard him.
...except you have been thinking too hard.
Haven’t you got some real important business to attend to?
Some place else.
- Sure.
But I always liked to keep you tracking about your whereabouts.
You know, Quirt...
...I always figured I would use a noose rope hanging around you...
Kind of respected it.
You never took the best of things....
...and all your men went down looking at you. go on and mind your own business.
I usually do.
Its a shame that things don’t always turn out the way it should.
Now that little girl... she would marry some young fella ..
...who would know what to do with that plough...
Why don’t you kick up that horse and move on?
Some young fellas that can raise a lot of grain.
...the cows, sheep, the kids..
..kind of a fella that she would always know where he was..
Do I have to run you off?
Well now I tell you.
I have never have been run off no place yet.
...where I aim to stay. it so happens that I gotta be gone.
No, Quirt...
...you don’t rate a new rope with me. look...
...is there is a lot of fooling around non sense have to go with it
..I am not going to stand for a lot of dressed up and jabber up people
...looking at me, just because I am getting married?
Quirt, come along. oh, yes or no?
- come along.
Those are black berries?
Alright
Alright.
Haven’t we have enough Quirt?
Never did like black berries...
Now I know I was right.
..It’s too much work
- I will get some.
Look out there is a wasp on the petunia!
- don’t kill it.
Well its alright to for you to trust a wasp and people but
...he might have known that I don’t trust him and decide to take the first bite.
And incidentally that’s not petunia, that’s a daisy.
That’s a petunia.
Petunias, daisies, daisies, petunias.
Quirt Evans.
Oh nothing.
I just like the sound of it.
Quirt. Where did you ever get such an odd name?
Fellow who raised me gave it to me.
He found me somewhere along a big cattle track.
Folks had been bushwhacked by the Indians,
I guess..
He was a big fella. Cattleman.
...swang a wide loop in his younger days
I think.
Wide loop?
He wasn’t too careful whose calf he threw his rope at..
Most of the old cattlemen were like that
He raised me. Quite a guy.
His name was Wall Ennis.
He was down in a gambling place...
...a fellow grabbed his gun-arm just as he drew.
He was murdered.
Stop it.
Then what?
Well I just danced around place to place.
Quirt Evans.
I don’t see any gun.
- I know him, he has got a gun alright..
...I know him ..
Well, what are we waiting for?
Nothing I guess. let’s find a saloon.
You don’t have to be worry about Penny, mother.
Oh, I cant help worrying,
Johnny.
Get that doctor,
Burn out the robe both ways.
Drink?
It’s amazing...
...the various uses to put man in alcohol.
Each different individual
A stimulant, depressant or anodyne
Just now I am using it for anodyne
Get to the point.
Practice of medicine...
...is one of the most infuriating profession known to man.
It takes 30 years of experience to teach you...
...and then in the final analysis there is nothing to do but stand and watch.
She has her elusive moment
You better speak to her
...I am not trying to argue you out of anything.
Maybe you would better stop and think.
She wouldn’t like this, Quirt!
...I am not arguing for or against her point of view.
...I know to her, the worlds worst tragedy would be if you should kill a man.
...of course you could argue logically
That she wouldn’t know whether you killed him or not.
I think she would know.
Any discussion has to have at least two participants.
Of course you can refuse to answer me.
I felt cynical....
...it would be a good opportunity to observe what we are about to see
...a perfect example of
'An eye for an eye'.
Unfortunately I cant quote chapter and verse.
...I am too tired to be cynical.
Father, father, come upstairs!
Penny, you are very ill, you must not be moving about.
Mother, I got to go .. you must get back into bed.
- But he needs me.
This is insanity. I told you to keep her in bed
You want to commit suicide?
If you don’t stay under those covers young lady...
There is no fever.
You must do what the doctor says.
- mother, please.
I can’t understand it.
I can’t understand it at all.
There must be some logical scientific explanation
I am too old to start believing in miracles.
You know if you two hadn’t had me covered
I will never let them harm the Jeffrey pistol with me...
Wait till Quirt Evans hear about this...
...well, it was Dodge City 7 years back.
...when the Earps were gunning, where me and Quirt...
Come here.
- Yes, Mr. Evans.
Laredo Stevens?
He is in the Golden Eagle, and the pistol eating Hondo is with him.
Take him a message.
Hey, how the boys are doing?
- Celebrating?
Good, why not?
Sure you get that excited when you make a big win like this?
Why get excited... sometimes you win and sometimes you loose.
Don’t get excited, gentlemen.
I ain’t looking for trouble..
I am just a carrier of a message.
- Yeah? What is it?
He said you to come out in the street..
...he his waiting for you.
- Who says?
Quirt Evans.
What is this, a joke?
Quirt Evans is...
Take a look out at the streets
See, who it really is.
Jack, take a look at the street.
It’s a tall armed man with a black hat standing.....
...near the blacksmiths shop
Mind if I use the backdoor, Pitt?
- go on, Pitt.
Well, they say cats got nine lives.
He also said he was curious to know how much whiskey you need
...to build up your nerves to come out.
You are fixing to get your ears pin back?
You need a pair of yours in the street if you wanna pin somebody’s ears back.
Hey, you drink this.
Sure, I don’t have to stand near you.
Come on.
I wonder whether that sharp shooting Martial is at town
Oh, I saw him ride out of town an hour ago.
That’s good, we don’t want him around to spoil our play.
Yeah! I bet, that’s just exactly how you meant it.
Look out, there is going to be a shooting.
Quirt!
Quirt...
...step away from those women.
Why don’t you turn around, Quirt?
Nothing ever works out right.
Had them rise up, they got the bigger stage
...so I figured out whets the rukkas.
You down them and I hang you....
...sort of...
..Sort of killing three hawks with one stone.
...so to speak.
Nothing, nothing ever works out right.
I may have missed you, Quirt, but I am patient..
...it’s only a matter of time, when I hang you.
Not me, mister.
From now on I am a farmer.
Hey Quirt might need that.
No, no man that carries a gun ever leaves one.
What are you going to do with it?
Hang it down on my wall at office with a new rope.
Fill up the canteens, Kid.
And don't forget that big water bag.
All right, Bob.
-Is that the place?
-That's it.
-Where's the bank? At this end of town?
-Me? I don't know.
The last time I was there, there was nothing... no bank, no railroad.
There was a little cantina... and the most beautiful girl named Josefina, that played the guitar.
We're robbing a bank, not looking up old friends.
Yes, I know.
But I sure wish we were rustling cows.
-You want to change your mind, too, Kid?
-Not me.
Well, you better think it over.
I hate to take you along.
This is no cinch, like rustling a few cows.
I thought it over, Bob, and I ain't backing down.
No, sir, I ain't backing down.
Look, Kid, the border's over yonder, just 60 miles.
Why don't you light out?
We'll join you. Promise you.
I ain't backing down.
Then remember... all you do is hold the horses. No shooting.
Well, at least the cows, they don't shoot back.
Mount up.
That's right friendly of them.
I know why I didn't recognize him.
She has changed his name.
She used to call him ''Tarantula.''
You know, a big bug with legs.
''Welcome'' is more neighborly, right, Kid?
Yeah, I guess so.
Yeah, I'm Sweet. Looking for me?
No, neighbor. Just admiring your shingle.
That's a mighty pretty name, B. Sweet.
You fellas come in with that cattle outfit?
No, just riding through. Little business.
Cattle?
Talked about it some.
What happened, man?
Nothing, sir.
Perley, come get your breakfast.
Perley Sweet?
Now, that is a right pretty name!
She just calls me that.
Most everybody calls me Buck.
Buck Sweet.
I didn't know you had company.
Just passing the time of day with these here cowpokes.
Ma, why don't you fetch us some coffee out here?
I'd be mighty proud to.
You not only got a pretty name,
Mr. Sweet.
-You got a mighty pretty wife.
-Thank you.
She's a little sprung now, but I'll tell you... that little woman used to be the best dancer in this whole territory.
I’ll bet you were mighty spry yourself, Perley.
I could kick a little.
Why don't you fellas light?
No, we better be moving on.
If you're looking for work... you'll find most of the cattlemen down by the bank.
-Where is that?
-Right down the street a piece.
Now, you boys have some hot coffee.
I know you've been riding a long ways.
And I can tell you're from Texas by your hats.
Yes, ma'am. We're from Texas, all right.
Besides, you're carrying slickers.
Don't rain much in these parts.
Did you come in by the Old Mormon Trail?
-Yes, ma'am, we did.
-Didn't use much water. Got a full bag.
Did you happen to meet up with my niece and her husband?
They're coming out by the way of New Jerusalem.
No, ma'am, we didn't.
I don't see how they could have missed them.
They're coming out by wagon, and expecting them for Christmas.
Perley went up in the mountains and cut a big piney tree this morning.
Do you think that he could have missed the turnoff at Terrapin Tanks?
Be just like him to.
Never knew such a shiftless fella.
Tried everything but preaching.
It don't take much brains to drive a wagon from New Jerusalem to Welcome.
-If he did, he'd never get here.
-Another cup?
No, thanks.
Say, I bet you put eggshells in to settle the grounds, like Ma used to do.
-'Course I do. Where you from, son?
-From Abilene.
And what's your name?
My name's William, but everybody calls me ''The Abilene Kid.''
I bet they called you ''carrot-tops'' when you went to school.
-''Brick-top,'' ma'am.
-They did? Me, too.
Thanks for stopping by, boys.
-Coffee was real nice.
-Mighty nice, ma'am.
Thank you very much, ma 'am.
I’m sure proud to have made your acquaintance, ma'am.
Thank you, son.
Well, Perley, thanks.
Hope you have a nice crop of apples this fall....
I’ll be seeing you boys, probably.
I do declare, but you're a sight for sore eyes!
You kind of got the advantage of me, ma'am.
I mean all of you. I’m so sick of the East.
For the past two years,
I've been back east in Denver, Colorado... hobbled up in a boarding school... till I just love the sight of anything sitting a horse.
-And that Charro saddle!
-See, Bob?
And what is your lovely name, seòorita?
My name? Lordy, my father's president of the bank. Tolliver Latham.
-I expect you do business with him.
-We aim to, ma'am.
Ruby, my girl!
Welcome. Welcome to Welcome!
Welcome home, Miss Ruby.
Remember, Kid, you don't do no shooting.
I thought so.
Real desperado type.
Pete, quick, get on your horse!
-Sorry, Miss Crumly.
-Tell me what's the matter.
Little bank robbery. Come on, get going!
Come on, Kid! Step up!
Haul it, Pete!
Get those bandits!
Don't let them get away!
Blast one at 'em, Pete. Hang on, Kid.
Again, Pete.
Pull up, men.
-Gosh, Marshal, you missed them.
-They ain't paying me to kill folks.
Them Texas boys gonna be mighty thirsty before they get to water.
-Back to the depot, Curly.
-The depot?
Yeah, the depot. The railroad depot.
Giddup.
You hurt bad, Kid?
-No, but I bled like a stuck pig.
-Don't try to talk, Kid.
That Perley character....
You know, he busted that on purpose.
Take a mouthful, Kid.
That's enough.
All right, men, raise your right hand.
As duly appointed Marshal of the territory of Arizona...
I hereby deputize you for the sum of $3 a day to find--
-Hey, watch them pack mules, will you?
-I’m doing the best I can.
Come on along, girl.
You unload them pack horses.
Get them on there.
Come on, Curly, I’m late!
-Come on, Curly, get them mules.
-Now, where was l?
Say, Buck, I thought we were gonna get $5 a day.
I don't spend tax money that easy.
$3 a day and found.
Now, you solemnly swear to uphold and enforce the law. Say, ''I do.''
-I do.
-Good.
Can I drag it now, Buck?
I’m eight hours late now.
Don't bust your bellyband, Luke.
We'll be aboard.
-Marshal.
-Yes, Mr. Latham?
Shouldn't you deputize more men?
The bank can't risk letting these desperadoes escape.
Sets a bad example.
I don't want you to fret none, Mr. Latham, but if it's gonna worry you....
Boys, Mr. Latham here just put up a reward.
$100, dead or alive, for every one of them poor fellas.
-Thank you, Mr. Latham !
-You got them for $100.
Thank you, Luke.
Good luck, Marshal!
Give the Kid a swig of water, Pete.
Drink it up, Kid.
Plenty more when we get to
Mojave Tanks. Drink it up!
There she is, fellas.
There she is, Mojave Tanks!
Water, Kid.
Water.
A thousand gallons of it.
You're gonna feel a whole lot better, a whole lot cooler... once we wash up that shoulder.
Go ahead, Kid.
Boy! I’m gonna skin me down to the hide... climb up that ladder, and dive in that tank, right to the bottom.
Never come up!
Gosh! That a man should have such a great big thirst like I have... and only water to quench it with.
Anyway, cheers, friends.
Get down.
Ain't no sign of anything.
But that's no guarantee they ain't around.
You boys keep your eyes open.
-Sure, Buck.
-You mind what I told you, now.
At night, two men stay awake while one sleeps. They won't rush two of you.
-I’d like to see them try it.
-Just don't get careless.
Ben, I’ll take that deck of cards in your pocket.
I ain't paying you pitch players to sit in the shade all day and claim low.
-Shall I drag her, Buck?
-Drag it, Luke.
Drag her, Jake!
Sons of bitches! Let's rush them.
Six-shooters against Winchesters?
I’ve seen enough.
That Perley character.... Tin star.
A lot smarter than I thought.
Well, let's take a look at it.
Up here's where we come from. Welcome.
Railroad winds around and makes a bend here at Mojave Tanks, where we are now.
Then it moseys off again to the southeast.
Down here's the Mexican border.
-50 miles, I figure.
How's 60, then?
So that Perley character starts playing checkers with us.
He figures we'll head this way, and right.
It's the first water.
So he jumps us and stakes out his deputies. No water.
So he figures our next move will be up to Apache Wells.
Right.
So he jumps on his freight car and heads that way.
And he'll be there, setting waiting.
He can keep squatting on his hunkers from now till Christmas...
'cause we ain't gonna be there.
We're doubling back on our tracks to Terrapin Tanks.
-But that's up to the north.
-We'll get our water.
We'll hole up in the piney woods until the Kid feels better.
Then while that marshal's sitting, getting calluses on his rump... we'll set out to the east... jump the tracks there, and be over the border.
Yes, that's good.
But where are we gonna get some water?
It looks like you and me are gonna chew a lot of barrelhead cactus... if we can find any.
Kid gets the canteen.
All right, Kid. Come on.
Get in the saddle.
-What are you doing?
-I’m tired of riding.
Besides, it cost me nothing.
It come with the horse.
Wind's getting hot.
Sí, what they call in my country a ''Santa Ana''... from the clouds of dust... that follow the cavalry of the illustrious General Santa Ana.
Let's make for that draw!
Kid, are you all right?
My shoulder. It kind of throbs.
-Could I have a little water, Bob? Please?
-Sure, Kid.
Take it slow.
That's enough.
Where did you picket the horses?
I tied the horses right there to the bushes.
But devils must have come in the middle of the night and let them loose.
My God!
But what have I done to deserve this?
I was always a good person.
That's what happens to me
after my decision to come here...
to this land, with these two fools.
-Shut up!
-What did I do to end up with these idiots?
Looks like we've got to walk a piece.
Well, what are we waiting for?
-Perley Sweet, what are you doing here?
-Hello, Miss Florie.
You seen three men come through here begging for water?
If I’d seen anything like pants around here... they wouldn't have had to beg for anything.
Come on, Curly, get that stock off of there, will you?
-We ain't got all day.
-I’m doing the best I can, Marshal!
-Come on, Curly, move!
-Hurry it up, will you?
Wait a minute!
What are you getting excited about?
I’m not excited. Come on, boys.
Fixing to stay here for a while?
Lordy! If this ain't a Christmas present for me.
A whole passel of men!
-Come on.
-That's right.
-How's Cousin Carrie Lou doing?
-Right pert, Florie. Come on, Curly!
Well, her loss is my gain.
There ain't been a soul around here to listen to me...
-since my old cat got tired and left.
-I’ll bet it was a tomcat.
Can I drag it now, Buck?
-I’m 16 hours and 29 minutes late.
-Drag it, Luke.
-Get that on there, boys.
-Drag it, Jake.
There she is, men. Water!
Lots of water.
What is it?
You hear anything?
Cover me, Pete.
There's a fine old state of affairs at the tanks.
-They ain't dry, are they?
-Worse than that.
It’s a tenderfoot wagon.
A man and his woman.
They come from New Jerusalem.
They made the tanks, all right, but the water was a little low.
Mr. Tenderfoot ain't got sense enough to dig out the sand... sit back and wait for that sump hole to fill up.
No, sir. Besides, he don't take kindly to using a shovel.
He puts in a stick of dynamite to start the water running.
-The fool!
-So he stuck in his dynamite.
Only fool's luck he didn't blow himself up doing it.
-I wish he did.
-But he didn't.
He just put Terrapin Tanks out of business forever.
He cracked the granite floor of that sump hole... and busted down her sides.
The tanks are dry.
And they'll stay dry.
They can have cloudbursts in this country from now till I get religion... them tanks will never hold another drop of water.
Fool tenderfoot's dead, I guess.
But he's gonna keep right on killing people, just the same.
Men will come here, banking on water.
Five or six years, there'll be a dozen skeletons... around them busted tanks.
But that ain't biting me half as hard as what he went and done next.
He let his stock nose around and lick up that alkali slop below the tanks.
It drove 'em plain loco.
They took off up the canyon, hunting water, with him right after them.
That's four days ago. He ain't back yet.
So we don't need to waste no time speculating on his case... or feeling sorry for him.
That wouldn't have been so bad... but he left his woman alone in that wagon.
Yeah, she's there right now.
She had a little water, so it wasn't so bad till yesterday.
Then it gives out.
Been pretty hard on her, in there all alone.
She's a nice little woman, too.
28 or 30, I’d guess.
Too blasted good for the cuss she married.
But still, that ain't the worst of it.
No, sir.
Not by a long shot.
She's gonna have a baby, and she's gonna have it now.
I’m a tough bird, an awful tough old bird... but I’m not going back in there!
Pete, you gotta go.
You gotta do something for her.
You ought to know something about these cases. You do, don't you?
Wasn't you married to a woman down on the Río Bravo?
Didn't she have kids for you?
Sure, Bob. Sure, she did.
But, you know....
An Indian woman is different.
God, our lord... tells them what to do with babies, how to born them.
But, a gringa....
Poor girl.
Yeah, my sister, she had all the neighbors, the doctor, nice white sheets, and--
Pete, I’m not passing the buck.
I’m just ruminating for information.
Pete, please....
Who are you?
Seòora... please do not be afraid of me.
I have come to help you.
Ain't no use there, Kid.
Only water we're gonna get is right over here.
Barrelhead.
It ain't the best water, and it will take time.
But I guess we got plenty of time now.
-Yeah, Pete?
-Bob, I’m going to need the water now.
-Give it to him, Kid.
-How is she?
I don't know. It is her first baby.
Come on, let's get back to squeezing barrelhead.
She wants to see you... all of us, together.
Did she have....
A boy.
I can't see you.
-You're the one that found me.
-Yes, ma'am.
-What's your name?
-Robert, ma'am.
Robert Hightower.
William Kearney, ma'am.
I’m proud to make your acquaintance, ma'am.
And you're Pete. Bless you.
Sí, seòora.
Pedro Encarnación Arango
y Roca Fuerte...
at your service, ma 'am.
Will you save my baby?
Yes, ma'am. I’ll save him.
And I will help.
Me, too, ma'am.
Poor little son.
You'll be all alone in the world when Mother leaves you... won't you, sweetheart?
And you'll miss me so.
Nobody to tuck you into bed at night.
Nobody to teach you your prayers.
Nobody to kiss the little sore spots... when you fall and hurt yourself.
Nobody to tell your little secrets to.
I want you, all of you... to be my baby's godfathers.
You will be, won't you, Bob Hightower?
You will, Bill Kearney? Pedro? Promise me.
I will, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
It will be a big honor, seòora.
And his name.
I call him Robert...
William Pedro...
Hightower.
And when he's a fine, big, brave man... like his godfathers... you tell him about his mother... who so wanted to live... for him.
Lift him up, please.
Let me kiss my baby.
It’s getting dark.
We must be moving on...
Robert William....
All right, Kid, go ahead.
Is that all, Kid?
Them's all the words I know, Bob.
Then, amen.
Yes, sir.
The more I think of that big fella in the Texas hat... the more I admire him.
Hurry up there, Curly!
We're hurrying, Buck.
I get him behind bars eating some of Ma's cooking...
I’m gonna play him a game of chess.
He'd be right good at it, too, I’ll bet.
Pay attention here, you fellas.
Come on, pay attention.
Stock's ready.
Now, it stands to reason that he'd head south for Mojave Tanks.
We should have reached there before he did, two horses packing three men.
And I don't take him for any tomfool to go rushing three men that's got Winchesters.
So I figured that his next move... would be to push right on through here to Apache Wells, where we are now.
I hate to admit it, but he's outguessed me.
They might have give out in that sandstorm--
Not that breed of cat.
They could have made for Dobie, down this way.
No, that's too far.
So's Dos Hermanas, down here.
They must have gone somewhere, Buck.
Yeah, and mighty cute, too.
He's doubled back on his tracks... and holed up right here at Terrapin Tanks.
That's where we're going.
We ain't gonna waste no time.
Let's go collect him.
All right, Buck.
You fellas keep your eyes open for strangers. Remember that reward.
-Okay, Buck.
-All right, Buck.
Tell Cousin Carrie Lou
I’ll be dropping in around New Year's... maybe with a new husband.
Gosh, Buck, we want to go with you!
You'd be a whole lot safer.
First thing, seems to me, we ought to give
Robert William Pedro a bath.
A bath?
I wasn't figuring on that at all.
I was thinking about feeding him.
I’m for tubbing him, all right.
Of course, sooner or later, we've gotta swab him down.
But he's such a little fellow, Bob.
-He won't use much water.
-He'll fit nice into this dishpan.
I was just wishing he could stagger along for a few days without bathing.
I don't know much about infants... but little Robert boy here looks clean enough for me.
Didn't you ask his mother nothing?
Do you think I was gonna drive the lady crazy... with a bunch of silly questions?
In my opinion, gentlemen, taking a bath is the least of little Robert's troubles.
He's just naturally gotta eat and wear something better than this towel.
It'll plumb scratch the hide off of him.
When a mother's gonna have a baby, she fixes up things for him.
Sews clothes real nice... and knits pretty little kickshaws and what all.
Maybe there's something for our godson in that tail box.
She had a heart, this mother.
She made really nice things for her baby.
Don't leave me out here all alone!
How long you gonna be?
They don't expect him to walk in them things.
And he ain't gonna wear that.
Now, this is something.
This is really something.
Canned milk.
That thick stuff ain't fit to squirt in coffee.
She wasn't figuring to feed him coffee, was she?
This is for Pedrito when he fixes himself up... and he touches his guitar under the balcony of a seòorita.
Bob, this is it.
Dr. Meechum on Caring for the Baby.
See what the doctor allows about bathing a newborn.
Here is a Biblia.
A Bible book.
''Bathing the baby.
''Too much care cannot be exercised...
''in performing this most important part of the baby's....''
There's a word here
I don't like to say in front of a little baby.
Spell it.
T-O-I-L-E-T-T-E.
Toi-letty?
What in the blazes is a toi-letty?
It’s a.... Don't you know?
I guess Robert boy ain't got no toi-letty in his war bag.
No, seòores.
Toi-letta, she is not an evil word.
A toi-letta is a little green tin bathtub... about the size of my arm.
Costs dos pesos.
When we get to town... we round up the best dad-blamed green toi-letty money can buy.
Remember that, Pete. Crack along, Kid.
What's the doc got to say next?
''The first bath should not be administered...
''until the baby is at least a week old.''
If I had a sick polecat,
I wouldn't send for that Doc Meechum.
A week without a bath.
That's all right for a grown boy... that ain't supposed to bathe between water holes... or in town on Saturday night, sparking his gal.
But a baby!
I’ll lay my silver spurs the doc's wrong.
Come again, Kid.
''Immediately after birth, the nurse...
''should rub the baby's body with olive oil.
''Or if olive oil is not available...
''with some clean, pure lard or grease.''
Grease!
-That?
-Sure, grease. Wait a minute.
Grease.
-Who's gonna grease him?
-You. You are boss wrangler.
It don't sound regular, Bob, I’ll admit, but it's right here in the book.
I ain't convinced nohow.
This godson of ours is starting life slippery enough without greasing him.
-But you got to follow the book, Bob.
-Sure!
Maybe it will prevent Pedrito from chafing and from getting saddle blisters.
Me and you have always been....
Wouldn't you like--
No, it's all right.
Cut out the Mex lingo around the kid, will you, Pete?
First thing you know, he'll be talking it.
We got to raise him with good old American habla, like his ma.
Hand over the pot.
We'll slick him up a mite.
Easy, easy.
-Pull his legs over a little bit.
-Get your finger out!
All right.
Bob, you ain't throwing a half hitch on a pack mule.
There. That will do it.
That kid's dideed, all right, and dideed to stay.
Cut out that Mexican.
Ain't you feeling good, Kid?
My shoulder kind of throbs.
We'll spare you a couple of swigs of water in a little bit.
You'll feel a lot better.
You better see what the doc is dealing next.
Food. Eat.
No, I got it, Pete. I got it right here.
''Feeding the baby.
''The best and surest method...
''is the one which nature has provided.''
Say that again.
''The one which nature has provided.''
-Well, that's out.
-Here, this is comforting.
This is downright comforting.
The doc allows that there's times when a newborn infant... won't thrive on nothing but condensed milk.
-We got some right here.
-Six cans.
Looks like you're going to get some chow, Robert boy.
All right, Robert William Pedro, but you're going to get fed.
You better get a can of that condensed milk and some matches--
-Bob!
-Yeah, Kid.
Let me hold him.
Gosh, Kid, you think you ought to, with that arm and all?
Let me hold my godson.
Just for a little while.
Thanks, Bob, for taking me along and all.
That is pretty, what the Kid is singing.
It’s what the folks back home would call a lullaby.
-Pete, what--
-It’s all right!
Okay, Pedrito. It's time to eat.
Go ahead. Come on, man.
Take it. It's good for you. Come on.
Boy, he hops to it like a drunkard at a Fourth of July barbecue.
A couple hours, and we'll have to set them up again for little Robert boy.
I’m for moving on now, Bob. Honest, I’m--
Just lie back and take it easy while you can.
That's the last of the gringo-head cactus.
She is finished.
I’ve been figuring. There ain't more than three shots apiece in these six cans.
That's 18 shots. We've used two already.
Leaves 16.
That little Pedro has enough for four days.
That's right. The Doc says little William is to get a slug every six hours.
Which doesn't leave much water for us godfathers.
There's always enough for you, Kid.
Here, have one on the house.
I’ve done a heap of ornery things... but I ain't stealing the water that belongs to my godson.
Too bad the doc didn't tell us where to get water in the Arizona desert.
Wrong book for that. Just a minute.
Maybe Nuestro Seòor has put here what to do in the Bible book.
Don't! It’s bad luck!
I can see it all mapped out: where to find our next water, where to head.
Maybe it says we should head back for Mojave and that reception committee.
Or over to Apache Wells, where old Perley is sitting.
Don't be too sure
Buck Sweet is twiddling his thumbs.
I think we ought to get out of here quick, now!
Where? Where, you jughead?
North to Cairo? Northeast to Damascus?
Or east to New Jerusalem?
60 miles or more with the Kid in the shape he's in?
And this punk?
Don't give me any more of your Bible talk.
I’d have outfoxed that marshal if they hadn't saddled this kid on us.
Why didn't somebody stop me before I promised that woman?
I don't want to grow no long white beard in the Yuma penitentiary.
May my beard grow clear till it gets down to my foots... may it get a nest of prison rats... before I break my promise to a dying woman!
-Who said I was breaking my promise?
-Why don't you kill the little fellow?
-Feed him to the coyotes!
-Why, you chili-dipping horse thief!
-Horse thief?
-Yes, horse thief!
Stop talking Spanish in front of the kid!
Now you see what you did?
You make cries the baby!
You waked the baby! Don't blame me!
Sure, nothing!
It says right here where we're to go, just like it's told everything about all this.
You fellas don't understand.
You think this is all just chance?
Just accidental, like us coming here this way?
Finding the mother, helping her....
The infant in the manger.
The star so bright last night.
I ain't talking out of no fever sweat,
Bob, honest I ain't.
You think we had anything to do with what's happened?
No, sir, we didn't.
No more than you had anything to do with throwing the book... so it would open in the place where I’ve been reading.
Where it tells where we're going to next.
-Listen, I’ll read it.
-No, Kid.
Go ahead, Kid, if it makes you feel any better.
''And when the days...
''of her purification were accomplished...
''according to the law of Moses...
''they lifted up the child and brought him to Jerusalem...
''to present him to the Lord.''
It says Jerusalem right here in the book.
New Jerusalem.
Look, Bob, maybe Nuestro Seòor... he no care very much what happens to a simple cattle thief.
But if I was in a gambling house,
I would play the Kid's number.
You would?
All right, let's get cracking along.
Kid, me and Pete will spell each other carrying the infant.
I’m toting my godson my share of the way.
That's part of it.
That's in the book, too.
There was three wise men come from the East, wasn't there?
Three wise men. I’m one of them.
I’m betting on you, Kid.
All right, Pete, which way's Jerusalem?
Why, that way, Bob.
Can't you see the star?
Look, water.
-That ain't water, Kid.
-Salt.
It’s a salt lake. We got to cross it.
-No.
-Just a little bit, Kid.
Don't be a fool, Kid. Drink it.
-You got to.
-No!
He shouldn't have made me swallow that, Bob.
-That's all right.
-You shouldn't have done it, Pete.
Once we're across the flats, we're through the worst of it.
Here.
-What are you doing?
-It will be easier crossing the sand.
There's plenty of rough country over there, Kid.
I ain't figuring on going that far.
No, sir.
I ain't figuring on that at all.
Take your horses down to the tanks, boys.
Fill up your kegs first.
-Sure need it, Marshal.
-They'll drink her dry, Buck.
Curly, take a look in that wagon.
Gosh, Buck, there's been a woman here.
Left her dresses all this and that way.
What are they like?
One's real nice, sort of faded, but soft, like silk.
-Is it red?
-Yeah, it's red with a....
Has the top got all little white ribbons all around the rim?
It sure has, Buck.
That was her wedding dress.
Fourth of July.
Red and white, carrying a little blue fan.
Come on, Curly.
Those fellas have done watered up... and then dynamited our tanks, left us dry.
Lot of boys stick up stagecoaches, and banks, and one thing or another.
But a man that would dynamite a water hole in this kind of country... is downright criminal.
-How about giving the stock--
-Can't.
-Can't we just wet our whistle?
-Can't.
You heard Mr. Latham when he said $100, dead or alive.
I’ll add $50 to it. I’d like 'em dead.
It’s time. Water.
If I whimper for water, Pete... don't give it to me. Promise.
-Promise.
-It’s a promise, Kid.
137th psalm.
One-three-seven. Read, please.
''By the rivers of Babylon...
''there we sat down...
''yea, and we wept...
''when we remembered Zion.''
''We hanged our harps upon the willows.''
''If I forget thee, O Jerusalem...
''let my right hand forget her cunning.
''How shall we sing the Lord's song...
''in a strange land?''
''Our Father, who art in heaven....''
''Our Father....''
''Now I lay me down to sleep.
''I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
''If I should die...
''before I wake...
''pray the Lord...
''my soul to take.''
God bless Mom and Pop... and sister.
Make me a good boy.
Amen.
When do we set up the drinks again... for Robert William?
I think about 50 minutes.
They're slipping it easy to the Kid up there.
Poor boy.
Made him a little boy again.
It’s broke.
Your leg?
-She's busted. I’m ashamed.
-Maybe I can fix it.
-Waste time.
-I can make a travois Comanche-style...
-and drag you.
-Waste time.
On the other side of the mountain,
New Jerusalem.
You will make it.
When does little Pedro eat next?
Not for more than two hours.
Adiós.
Guess I better get moving along.
Maybe you better leave me your pistol.
The coyotes, you know?
Yeah, sure, Pete.
Coyotes.
I’m sorry I called you a chili-dipping horse thief back there.
It’s all right.
I just remembered what tomorrow is.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, Pete.
Our Father...
who art in heaven...
make some space...
in your Holy Land...
for this poor Pedro.
Mount up. Let's get going.
''...unto Jerusalem....''
''...a donkey tied, and a colt with her:
''loose them, and bring them unto me.''
A donkey and his colt.
You just try stealing a man's burro in this country!
They'd string you.
That's it, Kid.
Sing it.
Sing a lullaby.
This is where she ends, godson.
This is the end of the trail, little Robert.
So, you break your promise
to a dying woman?
I can't go any further.
Of course you can, Bob.
What does the book say?
-Follow the book.
-Get up on your knees, you sack of dung!
You can't....
You got no right to call me that.
I’m going.
But you quit talking Mex in front of the infant.
You quit it, you hear?
-You're doing fine, Bob. Just fine.
-Sure I am.
Just think of the cantina
in New Jerusalem.
Yeah, I’m thinking of it.
A glass of beer.
-A big cool, cool glass of beer.
-Yeah.
Five glasses of cool beer.
You'll make it.
Sure I will.
Merry Christmas, everybody.
Merry Christmas to all.
Set 'em up, bartender.
Milk for the infant... and a cool, cool beer for me.
A baby!
Turn around, Texas.
Turn around and draw.
Perley, you old hay shaker.
You got me.
Looks like the baby's pappy... is a mighty sick man.
Texas, you're about half-smart.
Jury still out, Curly?
Yep, still out.
The boss says, ''Come and get it.''
I’ll thank you to remember there's only one boss around here.
Yes, sir, and she says, ''Chow's down.''
-Morning, Carrie Lou.
-Morning, Bob. Sit right here.
Thank you.
Folks at the courthouse said you looked mighty handsome in those new jeans.
Thanks, Carrie Lou.
And especially in those boots with the Lone Star stitched on them.
Yeah, they're real comfortable.
Hope the batter on this chicken is to your liking.
-Looks good.
-A little syrup for them corn oysters?
Corn oysters? I didn't get no corn oysters.
I only had but two ears of sweet corn.
All right, seeing what he did for little Buck.
Little Robert.
I told you he wouldn't stand for a name like that for a little Perley.
His name is Robert William Pedro Hightower.
Yes, of course it is, until the court changes it.
Ma !
Bob, have some coffee, will you?
You ain't eaten much lately.
-You off your feed or something?
-I’m worrying.
Don't worry about it.
Maybe the judge won't give you the full 20 years.
It ain't that.
I could do 20 years standing on my head.
I’m worrying since I hefted little Robert this morning. He's losing weight.
It’s only natural for new babies to lose a little weight, Bob.
He didn't lose any when I was nursing him.
No. We're giving that little dear just every care we can.
If he were our very own we couldn't love him more.
Ma, don't carry on, now.
One thing you can count on,
Bob Hightower... you couldn't find better hands to leave the little mite in... than Perley's and mine.
-That's right, Bob.
-Sure.
Maybe. You two being his uncle and aunt... sort of distant relations, you might say.
See, Ma, I knew he would.
I knew I had you pegged right.
Look, you just sign this paper right there on the ''X,'' see?
Wait up, now. Wait up. What is all this?
The adoption papers, of course.
I ain't anxious to turn my godson to pasture.
You just said right there that we were distant relations.
I never.
-The jury's coming in, Buck.
-How they look?
They look like a passel of pallbearers.
Your Honor, we find the prisoner guilty according to law... but under exterminating circumstances.
Before passing sentence upon you,
Robert Marmaduke Hightower--
Now, have you anything you wish to say?
No, sir. I guess I ain't.
You ain't?
It seems, in this case... we have a mighty fine set of extenuating circumstances... notably dealing with an infant child you claim to be your godson.
He is my godson.
And now we come to the question of the infant's custodianship.
Who gets him, etc.
-Your Honor, if the court pleases--
-Yes, I know.
I got your application right here.
Prisoner, have you any objection to the Marshal and Mrs. Sweet... taking this here child?
If you mean permanent,
I got plenty of objections... but if it's temporary, that's different... providing, of course, they guarantee to give him a good education and such.
And just what specific do you mean as ''and such,'' etc.?
Teach him good horse sense, respect... say, ''Yes, sir'' when he's spoke to, and....
That seems reasonable.
Do you agree, Buck?
Sure, Wiley.
But what Ma and me wanted was to have little Buck permanent.
Sure you would, but you ain't going to get... little Robert William Pedro permanent, Perley.
Now, that's as it may be, etc. and so forth....
Robert Marmaduke Hightower... it is within the power of this here court... to sentence you to a term of 20 years in the penitentiary.
However, this here court... may be willing to suspend that sentence indefinite... providing you sign this here paper... yielding your godson to the Marshal and Mrs. Sweet... and furthermore providing that you never again set foot... in the township of Welcome, territory of Arizona.
You can throw the book at me, Judge.
I ain't gonna do her.
I ain't breaking my promise to a dying woman.
That's just what I been waiting for to hear you say, son.
I hereby give you the minimum sentence under the law: one year and one day.
Court's closed, bar's open.
Double bourbon, bartender, if you please.
Bye, friend.
I’ll be awfully good to little....
Robert William Pedro.
-Goodbye, Bob.
-I know you will, Carrie Lou.
Goodbye and good luck, boy.
A year in jail will do you real good.
Thank you, ma'am.
Bye, Bob. Good luck.
-Goodbye, Perley, you old hay shaker.
-Goodbye, Bob.
Say, kind of look after my deputy, will you?
See he gets started home from Yuma all right.
You know, he's never been away from Welcome before.
Sure, I’ll take care of him.
Put him on the train myself.
-Mr. Hightower.
-Miss Latham.
I want to thank you for that Lady Baltimore cake.
-I’m mighty glad you liked it.
-It would have been a lot lighter... without that hacksaw you baked in it.
Proud to haul you, son.
Can I write to you, Mr. Hightower?
Can I call you Bob?
I’d be proud for you to take your pen in hand, Miss Latham.

Whoa.
All out, all out! What's the matter, a holdup?
Nope, they missed us.
This is as far as we go.
Wait. It says three miles to Wagon Gap.
That's as close as we go, partner.
That sign is a warning. Nobody that ain't loco ever goes closer.
I hope you sell your wares.
I hear tell there's a lot of money in Wagon Gap.
The only problem is to live long enough to get it out.
Partner, which way you say it was to Wagon Gap? That way.
That way? Come on, Duke. Wait a minute.
What are you scared of? Wagon Gap.
We'll sell our wares tonight and leave for California in the morning.
If you boys are going into Wagon Gap, strap on a couple of shootin'irons.
If you can bluff'em, you might live till morning.
He's got something there.
How much will you take for those guns? Fifty dollars.
It's a deal. There you are. Thanks.
Aw, Duke, that ain't fair. What's wrong?
Look. Yours is much longer than mine! So what?
All you have to do is stand closer to whoever is shooting at you.
As long as you boys are going into Wagon
Gap, would you mind taking this mail?
Why, certainly!
There you are.
Giddyap, horse.
"Joe Bazzo,
Erskine Lakes.
"Dear Sal, this is to let you know...
"we are building a new log house where the old log house stood.
"We are using the logs from the old log house to build the new log house, but we are going to let the old log house stand until the new log house is built. "
I don't get it. What are you reading other people's mail for?
What are you ducking for?
You scared?
Come on, get with it.
Duke, let's go in here.
It's safe.
Chester, come out of there!
You don't belong in there.
What's the matter? Tired? Sit down. Yeah.
Come on.
Let's go.
Chester, don't let this town scare you. You gotta keep saying,
"I must be brave. I must be strong. " Say it to myself?
Certainly! I must be brave. I must be strong.
Now you're talking!
I must be brave.
I must be strong.
I must be nuts!
Oh, no, you don't!
Come back with that merchandise!
What are you gonna do?
Be just as tough as they are!
You never shot one of those.
What's the difference?
Get out your gun.
I never shot one either. Take the gun out. We'll fix them.
What am I gonna do with it?
Shoot it off! Up in the air.
But it makes a noise. C'mon, shoot it off!
It's Fred Hawkins!
That's nice shooting, partner.
And you got him right through the heart.
I got him? I shot over there. He fell over here.
Then that really is nice shooting!
Jake Frame's been tryin' to get rid of this varmint!
C'mon inside.
He'll set up the drinks free.
I told you shooting was the only way to come into this town.
Wait a minute.
This man's just been killed.
So? Who's upset? I am.
Judge?
Judge Benbow?
Judge?
Jim, what are you and the
Citizens' Committee riled about now?
I demand that those men be charged with murder and held for trial.
Well, now,
I don't know, Jim.
It looks like a friendly shootin' affair to me. Self-defense.
Fred there's got a gun in his hand.
There have been 10 killings in the last week... and not one man has been brought to trial.
What sort of law do we have here? All right, if you insist.
What's the deceased got on him?
Twelve dollars and this knife in his hip pocket.
I hereby fine the deceased $12 for carrying concealed weapons.
Just a minute, Judge. You heard what the judge said.
Yeah, just a minute, Judge.
Stay out of this, Frame.
This is one pair of killers you're not getting off.
Simmer down.
I'm on your side.
Just what kind of a trial was that? Jake, I...
Strangers come into town and shoot down one of our best-beloved citizens...
And you want to let them get away with it.
What's got into you? That's the fellow that was gonna buy us a drink?
It isn't safe for a man to walk the streets of Wagon Gap.
You said it. That fellow almost fell on me.
If the law won't do something, we better do something.
I'm thinkin' a little taste of rope is called for!
Wait a minute.!
Judge Benbow, stop this. You nor anybody is stopping this hanging, Simpson.
Get outta the way.
You're obstructing justice!
Is that hard to do? No, no.
You'll soon get the hang of it.
Try this on for size.
Sixteen and one-half.
How's that?
That tickles.
Yeah? That did it. It don't tickle no more.
The Citizens' Committee is headed this way. Get goin', boys.
We gotta stall 'em.
Stall 'em? Oh, stall 'em!
Ever hear the story about the traveling salesman? They've heard that.
Yes, and it ain't funny. Wait a minute!
What about our personal possessions?
Don't you want to send something to your dear mother for a keepsake?
My mother? Yes! To your mother.
Oh, my mother! I would like to send some stuff to my mother.
Would you take care of this stuff for me? I'd be happy to.
It's priceless, this stuff.
Hold that please.
Give it to him.
String 'em up!
Sorry to spoil your party.
This is gonna be done legally.
Since when are you the law? I don't see the sheriff's badge.
Somebody put a bullet hole through it.
Till we can keep a live sheriff, the committee's taking over.
We're seeing that these men get a fair trial. Fair enough.
And I'll see to it thatJudge
Benbow gives it to 'em.
C'mon, boys!
Just because he don't like you, he's mad at us. Don't be ungrateful.
If it wasn't for Mr. Simpson, we'd be dead.
If it wasn't for Mr. Simpson, we'd be on our way to California.
Give us a couple of horses and show us the road.
We'll call it even. The only road you're taking is to Wagon Gap.
You're charged with a killing, and you're gonna stand trial.
You can figure out your plea.
I'll plead insanity.
And I can prove it too.
This court will now come to order.
Close down that bar!
And quit gambling for a few minutes!
Will the jury file in.
I object!
Order in the court!
He objected... to what you said.
I figured you might be wanting a jury... so, to save time,
I picked one for you.
Look!
That's the gang that was gonna hang us.
To keep everything legal,
in case you don't like any member of thejury, you can challenge him.
I'll fight that little shrimp there. Order!
Order in the court!
Young man, in about two shakes,
I'll hold you in contempt.
Judge, quit stalling. Let's get this over with. Okay, Jake.
Hmm.
As the judge, I hereby sentence you two coyotes...
Just a minute,
Your Honor.
I'd like the court's permission to say a few words to the defendants.
I don't know, Jim. We're keeping
Jake's business shut down, and these delays are costing him money.
But go ahead and make it snappy. Thank you, Your Honor.
Boys, it strikes me mighty curious thatJake
Frame's so anxious to get you hung.
I'd like to know why. Don't ask us. We're strangers.
If you'll string along with me,
I've got an angle to keep you alive.
All right, Mr. Simpson.
We're in back of you. Good.
Your Honor, the defendants are willing to plead guilty... to the charge of killing
Fred Hawkins in a gun duel.
He did it again.
He said we did it.
Now they'll hang me.
Are you guilty?
No. Then what are you worrying about?
Oh.
Jim, the court thanks you for simplifying matters.
I hereby sentence you two coyotes... Your Honor, may I remind you that you have a jury? I picked them, didn't I?
You picked some before they were ripe!
Shut up, you.!
You boys want to get your heads together and bring in a verdict of...
Your Honor, I suggest you first acquaint the jury... with the statutes pertaining to dueling.
Jim, let's not get all snarled up in legal folderol.
I have the statues. Would you like me to read them?
Or would you prefer to quote them from memory?
No, no.
Go ahead.
Section 86-97 of the penal code of the sovereign state of Montana.
"If any person slays or permanently disables another person in a duel,
"the slayer must provide for the maintenance... of the wife of the slain and for the minor children. "
And Section 86-98...
"Said slayer must pay all debts of the person slain. "
What does he mean?
Yes.
Oh. In simpler language, the law makes these men responsible... for all the obligations of the deceased... both to his family and his creditors.
Hawkins owed me $50,
Your Honor.
Considering what Hawkins owed me,
I'd say that's a right good law.
As a matter of fact, Jake,
I think so myself.
Especially the part about them maintaining the widow.
Well, this is it. I don't see any corn growing.
The widow don't grow corn.
Then what's that scarecrow doing in the yard? Who you calling a scarecrow?
You scatterbrained numskull!
Ah, the Widow Hawkins!
Howdy, Mrs. Hawkins. These are them. The culprits, huh?
Mrs. Hawkins, I'm awful sorry. Oh, think nothin' of it!
I ain't hypocrite enough to shed tears for Hawkins.
He wasn't any good. All he ever did was drink and gamble.
Hawkins, come here!
All he ever did was drink and gamble. Come on, Duke!
Nice dog.
Go on, Wolf. You have the situation well under control, ma'am.
Guess we can get back to town. Just a minute, Judge.
As long as our main obligation is to take care of Mrs. Hawkins and the kids, why can't we make some kind of a financial arrangement? Such as?
We'll give her some cash now and send a little every month from California.
How much you got?
Well, let me see.
Hmm, I have $70.
Precisely the amount the deceased owed me. Poker the other night.
Duke, think of something else. I have.
Judge, there was only one bullet found in the body of the deceased.
You can't hold both of us.
It's not legal.
Don't get technical.
You got a point, Eagan.
Yes, and he's pointing it at me. Quiet.
Ma'am, we have to keep this thing legal. We've got to let one go.
Which one do you prefer?
Well... ain't much to pick from, is there?
The little one looks good, but maybe the big one would be a better worker.
Ahem. Judge, you have no objections if we gamble for this?
There's no law against gambling providing it's honest.
I'll play it as honest as you would. Go ahead.
Take a card.
Any one? Any card. I won't even look.
Don't look at it! You didn't give me a chance.
Don't try to cheat.
Play it on the up and up.
What card were you thinking of? What card?
What card were you thinking of?
C'mon, get it over with.
I was thinking of the nine of clubs.
Oh, no. It was the eight of spades.
That's the card you were thinking of? That was the card.
How do you know it was the eight of spades? Just a minute!
What does that look like? The eight of spades.
That ain't fair. Just a minute, please.
You, you, you! I'll leave it to the judge. Judge?
That's the way I'd have done it. That's what I thought.
Good-bye, ol' pal.
I'm going to miss you.
On my way to California, I'm going to be alone and desolate,
left with nothing but fond memories of our long friendship.
Good-bye, Chester, old boy. Good-bye, Duke.
Ma'am, take good care of him.
I feel terrible bein' the cause of you two good friends partin'.
It'll be hard for me for a while, but I'll get over it.
Judge, my money.
What money?
You found me innocent. Therefore I don't have to pay Hawkins's debts.
That's right.
Son, it sort of cracks my heart to separate you two fellows.
So I'm gonna do you a kindness.
I hereby appoint you custodian of the guardian.
And as such, you will see... that he carries out the terms of his sentence.
What's that for?
Legal fees.
But... that's not...
That's not legal.
Just as legal as that card trick of yours.
Ma'am, they're both yours. I'll get back to town. Good afternoon, gents.
All right, men.
Let's go.
Are you satisfied?
Now we're both stuck on this broken-down ranch with nothing to do but work.
Hey, it could be pretty nice work too.
Juanita?
Come here.!
This is Juanita, my eldest.
How do you do? I'm Duke Eagan.
This is my pal,
Chester Wooley.
This one's your new guardian.
And this is a critter that needs guarding.
She's got some frisky notions
I'm expecting you to halter.
I don't think you'll be mean to me, Mr. Wooley, or can I call you Daddy? Oh, ho-ho.
What's the matter with you?
I'm a guardian to the guardian, but you can call me... Call him Duke.
Juanita, get in the house and rustle up something for supper.
You fellows go to the pump and wash up.
Go with 'em, Wolf.
I hope this soup's just right.
If I'm any judge of character, the way to Mr. Wooley's heart is through his stomach.
You don't have to cotton to him, Ma. He's a prisoner of war.
When a woman gets to be my age, the only way she can be sure of a man is to marry him.
I've got the young'uns to think of.
Suppose Mr. Wooley isn't the marrying kind?
Oh, every man's the marrying kind!
All you got to know is how to go about gettin' him.
More flies are caught with honey than vinegar.
So beginning now, I'm a woman of honeyed words.
Everything I say to Mr.
Wooley will be sweet as nectar.
My muted voice will be tuned to the strings of his heart.
My touch will be feathery light as I stroke those strings... to bring forth a dulcet melody of love.
What ifhoney doesn't work on Mr. Wooley?
Then I'll hog-tie him!
Come and get it!
Come and get it!
Matt, get outta there!
Beginning tonight, Mr. Wooley sits at the head of the table.
Ma? Git before I take a ladle to you.
Take your rightful place,
Mr. Wooley.
Mr. Eagan, you sit on
Mr. Wooley's left hand... and, Matt, you sit on his right hand.
What do I eat with? My feet? Oh, sit down.
Ha-ha.
Fooled ya!
Ha! Ha, ha.
Ha!
Sit down. What's the matter with you? Okay.
Mr. Wooley, help yourself to some bread, fresh baked, especially for you.
Duke, can I have a piece of bread?
Help yourself.
There's none there.
Have a piece of mine.
Hog, don't eat so fast!
Mr. Wooley, have a piece of my bread.
Thank you.
You're such a good child.
Soup's one of my best dishes.
Try it, Mr. Wooley.
Please excuse yourself.
I didn't do nothing. See that it don't happen again.
Go on, eat your soup.
Go on, eat your soup! Yes, sir.
I told you not to let that happen again.
Excuse yourself!
I didn't do nothing.
It's the soup. Don't blame it on the soup.
I don't have to brag about my soup,
Mr. Wooley. It speaks for itself.
You can say that again.
Oh, eat your soup.
It's that good, huh? Mm-mmm, delicious.
That's okay with me.
Listen, don't hurt the widow's feelings. I won't say nothing.
Look, eat the soup whether you like it or not.
So I'll make a face. What do
I care? Just eat your soup.
Stop talkin' and let me eat my soup. Eat it.
Ahem, ahem. You got a frog in your throat?
Of course not.
I'm sorry. It's the way he eats at home.
What's the matter?
Yeah, the soup.
You can't dive into it.
Just eat it.
What's the matter with you?
Is something wrong?
What is it?
You've got a tongue, haven't you?
What? Eh?
You're trying to say something.
Well, bring it out!
It's a fine conversation.
Very interesting.
Eat your soup.
Duke, will you eat my soup and let me eat your soup?
Will that make you happy? Very happy.
My goodness, take it.
Thank you ever so much.
I'll take care of it.
Thank you very much.
It's all right.
How is it? You heard what the widow said.
Her soup speaks for itself. Not only that. It will talk back to you.
You don't know what you're talking about. I don't.
Are you expecting company? No, but you are.
You eat too dainty!
Quiet.
Go on, eat.
Delicious.
Dig right in!
It ain't nice to do those things.
Will you please make up your mind?
Eat your soup.
Eat yours.
What a night.
I love the stars
I love the moon
I'd love December
If it came in June
I...
Yi-yi-yi.
Lovely.
Did you like it? Uh-huh.
Sit down, Mr. Wooley.
Thank you.
Ah, loose your tie.
Go ahead! I don't know you that well.
Land sakes, man. I want you to make yourself to home.
Mr. Wooley, I ain't a person to beat around the bush.
I'm a woman. You're a man. That's the nicest thing anybody ever said to me.
Well, Mr. Wooley,
Chester, a woman means a lot to a man, and a man can mean a lot to a woman.
Me and Hawkins didn't get along. He never come home.
I've been a lonesome woman these past few years.
I know just how you feel.
I've been awful lonesome myself. Have you?
Haven't you ever wanted somebody... waitin' for you when you come home at night?
Somebody... Somebody to kiss you when you open the front door?
Someone whose hair you caress with a loving touch?
Someone whose presence would cheer and warm you?
Haven't you ever wanted to embark on the sea of matrimony?
Your boat of bridal wreath and orange blossoms... crosses the shoals of acquaintance into the sea of affection.
The tempest of love causes the waves of emotion... to toss you helter-skelter, hither and thither, here and yon, round and round.
Stop, stop.
Stop the boat.
I'm gettin' seasick.
Ah, Mr. Wooley,
I'm not a forward woman.
All my life
I've been shy and bashful, just a rosebud afraid to bloom.
But now I'm takin' the bull by the horns!
Sit down!
I've been tryin' to convey to you in an indirect way that I'd consider matrimony.
That is, after you've been here a bit.
You mean, me and you get married?
Will ya?
Shh.
We shouldn't let the children hear this. Uh-uh.
No!
Duke? Duke!
The widow wants to marry me. Well, congratulations.
My little pal embarking on the sea of matrimony. Stop, stop.
I just made that trip, and
I am not going to get married.
I wouldn't be so hasty. There's ways of making you change your mind.
And you too!
Now get to bed.
There's work to be done in the morning.
Watch 'em, Wolf!
I don't like the looks of this. Should we make a getaway?
Get down.
Wait a minute.
That dog knows what we're talking about.
How does the dog know you said "getaway"?
Duke, don't say those words.
Nice doggy, nice doggy.
Lie down. Lie down.
Uh-oh!
Hey, Duke,
I think I got him fooled.
When he ain't looking, we'll make a g-e-t-a-w-a-y.
How do you like that?
He can spell too.
Chester, we've got to find some way of getting rid of that dog.
Duke, fire stick.
Right.
Nice doggy. Nice doggy. Hold it.
Nice doggy.
Sit still.
You go out and open up the door. Hold him.
Nice doggy.
Don't bite.
Look, doggy.
Show him the stick!
Doggy, c'mon.
Take it easy now.
Nice doggy.
We were just on our way to bed.
Nighty-nighty-nighty.
Hey! Hey!
That ain't fair. It's cold down here, and you've got your coat on.
Why haven't you,
Mr. Wooley?
It's time you were dressed.
There's water to be drawn, the cow to be milked, the chicken coop fixed, the fence whitewashed.
I'll get the children up to help me. Don't you dare!
After all, you're not their father, Mr. Wooley.
Or... has your heart softened?
No, ma'am.
Then get to work.
The lower forty needs plowin', the harness needs sewin'.
If I do all that today, I'll have nothing left for tomorrow.
Don't worry,
I'll think of somethin', unless you've reconsidered my offer of marriage.
Mrs. Hawkins, marriage is nothing but a three-ring circus.
First the engagement ring, then the wedding ring... and then "suffer-ing. "
Duke? Duke!
I'm not gonna take the bed. What do you want?
The widow's awful mad.
She's gonna work my head off.
Will you help me? All right, I'll help you.
I'll stay here and watch the kids.
Ohh!
Here's the water.
Now look what you've done!
No water, no breakfast.
Now get goin'!
Here's the water.
Pour it in the kettle. Yes, ma'am.
Oh, boy, am I full. Oughta be after all those pancakes.
How 'bout those six eggs he ate?
Aw, shut up.
Mrs. Hawkins? Dinner will be at noon.
I haven't had my breakfast. Them that ain't here on time don't eat.
If I don't eat, I can't work. It's your own fault.
Mr. Wooley,
I'm a tenderhearted woman.
I'm filled with the milk of human kindness.
I'm overflowing with the love of mankind.
Mine is a tender heart, ever ready to take into its fold... the tired, the sick, the weary.
Do you get what I'm driving at?
Yes, ma'am, but you're trying to hitch up to the wrong horse.
Why don't you make Duke do some work? I hate to admit this, but I had to tell Mrs.
Hawkins about my heart trouble.
Heart trouble? Don't shout like that.
You, you... No, no. Work makes me sick.
I guess I'll just have to lie around.
That won't be hard. You're the best liar around these parts.
Don't talk to Mr. Eagan like that. Get to work.
Betsy needs shoein' so
I can drive her to town.
The children will meet you in the barn and point her out.
Now git!
Mrs. Hawkins...
Git!
Heart trouble.
Wish I'd have thought of it.
Which one is Betsy? That one? Ah, that's Betsy.
Your mother said
I got to shoe her.
Land sakes, what's the commotion?
Mr. Wooley's shoeing Betsy, so he thinks.
Mr. Wooley, what on earth?
I had to lend her mine.
Ma!
Ma! Ma!
Ma!
Ma.!
Ma!
What are you making all this noise for? I can't sleep.
Give me that brush.
Ma!
Mrs. Hawkins, I'm not going to do it anymore. I'm getting dishpan hands.
It's your own fault.
Keep on scrubbing. Ma! Ma!
Get to the front quick.
There's gonna be trouble.
Juanita's talking with Jake Frame, and I just saw Jim Simpson comin'.
I've had enough trouble with Jake Frame.
Wooley, chase him off the place. Get goin'!
Mr. Wooley, when I tell you to do something, don't stop and play.
C'mon!
Mr. Wooley, I want you to throw that ornery skunk off my property.
I was fixin' to do that,
Mrs. Hawkins.
Why don't you start? This is a family affair. Throw him out!
Mr. Frame?
He don't wanna go.
Jake came to get my answer about coming to work at the Round-Up.
There's that matter of $1,100 owed me by your late husband.
It's generous ofJake to give me a chance to pay off the family debt.
Young lady, as long as I'm your guardian... you will never step inside that saloon.
Good for you,
Wooley!
Watch out for the flowers. Hey.
I've got Hawkins's IOUs.
IfJuanita doesn't work for me, somebody else is going to work off that debt.
Working in a saloon might be good experience for a girl. According to the law, Wooley, that's your responsibility.
But I work here all day!
You'll work for me at night.
Be at the Round-Up at 7:00.
The widow's on the warpath.
You better do something.
Do you think she could use a 75-year-old man? 75?
That's how old I'm gonna be before I pay backJake Frame.
Talking about money, this is all the money I've made since I've been working here.
Some guy tipped me a big penny and thought he was doing me a big favor.
Say, that's a $20 gold piece.
Chester, we're on our way.
We'll ride that to California. Ain't it a little small for both of us to sit on?
I'm going in that poker game. Then watch my smoke. Suppose you lose.
Oh, no, certainly not.
With your help, I can't.
Come here.
Well, what do you boys do?
Bet 50.
I'll see that and up it 100.
I'll call that, and I'll raise it 100.
Let's bump it again.
I'll see that... and up it another 100. That's all for me.
I'll call that.
I got a straight.
All blue, boys. Back to the mines for me.
What do you know?
Sure had a lucky streak.
How much did we win? Well, not enough to pay off everything, but a couple more games like this and we're on our way to California.
Cash me in.
Look, don't let Frame know that we won this money.
Frame.
That's me.
Frame!
Frame. Here, put your ashes here.
I'm so busy and so tired,
Mr. Frame.
Looks like you had a streak of luck, Eagan.
How 'bout you and me sitting down to a couple of hands?
He can't. He's gotta go home right away. Mrs. Hawkins is waiting.
Oh, no, I ain't.!
Oh, yes, you...
I'm here to see you,
Frame.
You and me's got to have a showdown about Wooley. Stay where you are!
This day and night work ain't a-workin' out.
He no more gets through working for me, when he goes to work for you.
Then he no more gets through working for you, when he goes to work for me.
He'll be an old man before his time. My offer still stands.
I'll be glad to replace him forJuanita. Juanita's staying home.
In that case, we can't do business.
I was just talkin' to Eagan about a poker game.
We'll play it three ways.
We get a stack of chips.
Eagan puts up his roll against our interest in Wooley.
Whoever wins gets the money and full possession of Wooley.
You can count me out.
Duke, go ahead and play. If you win, I'm free. No, I...
Yeah, yeah.
All right, I'm in!
How 'bout you, Mrs. Hawkins?
I don't believe in gambling.
Gambling's a sinful, crime-breeding curse. Where are the cards?
Sit down, Mrs. Hawkins.
I'll take over, Joe.
There you are.
Wait a minute.
Women first.
How 'bout
Mrs. Hawkins dealing?
All I know about cards is what
Hawkins told me. I never played before.
We won't have any trouble with her. Certainly not.
You never played cards before?
Uh-uh.
Cut 'em. Cut 'em? Where'd you learn that?
Hawkins. Hawkins. You heard what the lady said, cut 'em.
Ante up.
Hawkins.
Hawkins!
Hawkins!
I'll open.
I'll stay.
What do I do now?
Give me two cards.
I'll take one.
I'm standin' pat.
Hawkins?
Two reds.
Well...
I'll see your two and I'll raise you two.
I don't want to cast any reflections, but... a person has to think twice before buckin' luck like yours.
You may have me beat and then again you mightn't.
Wooley, stop skitterin'!
And put that spittoon down.
I gotta...
Put it down!
I'll see your bet... and sweeten it a little.
I'll stay.
Well...
I'll see that... and I'll raise you two.
I'll tell you what.
Let's get this over with in one hand. Shoot the works.
All I can lose is Wooley, and that ain't much.
I'm in.
Overworked. Let him lay. He needs the rest.
You pay him.
Sure.
I have invested my cash in Widow Hawkins's property.
I've got a fat deal there.
Duke?
Pardon me.
We've got to get out, or I'm gonna be a bride. Beat it!
I'm tryin' to do a little promoting. A lot of"symphony" I get.
Go ahead!
Sweetheart, how would you like to finance an expedition to California?
Wooley, come here.
Would you excuse me, please? Okay, bub.
I thought you went home with the widow.
I did... but I came back again.
Mr. Frame, I wish you'd a-won me in the game.
Working here is much easier than marrying her. So that's it.
Wooley, I'm beginning to really feel sorry for you.
How would you like to earn a couple of fast horses and a stake to California?
If you'd give us the horses, you can forget the steak.
I'm not hungry, just tired.
A miner friend is getting worried about the amount of gold he's got.
If you can get the information from your friend, Jim Simpson, as to when the next bullion shipment is coming through,
I can ship my friend's gold along with it.
If I ask him that, you'll give us the horses? That's right.
I'll go over and ask him.
Don't give him any reasons.
My friend wants to keep it confidential. Oh, a secret.
You don't want the stage-holdup guys to find out about it.
That's right.
I won't tell them.
I won't tell nobody but you.
I'm smart.
I got brains I haven't used yet.
Well, don't let 'em go to your head.
Hello, Chester! Just the man I'm looking for.
What'll it be? A shot of milk. Make it a double.
What do you want to talk to me about? Shh, shh.
When is the next gold shipment coming in? Why do you want to know?
Mr. Frame says
I mustn't tell.
But if I find out, he will do me a big favor.
Oh. Well, in that case,
I'll be glad to help.
The next shipment's due on... Thursday. Thursday?
Oh, good! Let's have a drink on that.
Thursday.
Good luck.
Thursday.
Thursday.
What's up? You know the gold's comin' through on Wednesday.
We can set a trap for Frame and his gang the day after... and catch 'em robbing the coach red-handed.
California's the land of golden opportunity.
You'll have a stocking full of gold!
I've got that now, and I'm gonna keep it.
Duke, we're practically on our way to
California. What are you talking about?
The gold shipment is coming in Thursday.
All I've got to do is tell Frame.
He'll give us horses and the money.
You can't tell him that.
He's the one they suspect.
Suspect of what? Of all the stagecoach robberies.
Oh, what am I gonna do? Tell him the shipment's going through Wednesday.
You'll be doing yourself and the
Citizens' Committee a big favor.
Tell him Wednesday?
Yes!
When he finds out, what will he do to me?
We'll be on our way to California. C'mon.
Mr. Frame... Wednesday. Good.
When do we get the horses? They'll be in the barn Wednesday night... after I've checked your information.
Mr. Frame...
You and your big ideas.
Now I'm in worse trouble.
If you tell Frame the truth, think of the hole it'll putJim in.
Duke, if Frame finds out I'm lying, think of the hole he'll put me in!
I was just coming home.
I'll take care of you later. Where's
Juanita? She should be home in bed.
Keep your hands in your pocket
She should be, but she ain't.
That's her voice! She's in there. We just left.
Now you're going back in.
Find Jim Simpson and bring him here. Lead the way, Wooley.
You heard what Ma said!
"Lead the way, Wooley. "
Make the cash box ring ting-a-ling
Before the night's any older
Set 'em up, Bill and fill up the till
If you have gold then you're welcome
Juanita? Juanita!
Shut up, yourselves!
You can have what's nice if you have the price
Wooley, drag her off that stage!
Me?
Yes, you!
Ain't you the one that forbid her to set a foot in this place?
Go on!
Go ahead!
You've got everything I want Juanita?
Your mama wants you to go home! Sit down!
Get her off there,
Wooley!
Juanita, you've gotta come home with the family.
Juanita, come on home.
Your mama wants you!
Juanita, c'mon home! Wait a minute. Frame says let her stay.
I say, take her out!
Stop that!
Ow!
Ohhh!
Leave that child alone!
Are you gonna let her get up on that stage?
Are you? Go ahead and shoot me and inherit this family.
Go ahead.
Not me.
Oh, c'mon. Oh, no. I don't want 'em.
You don't want 'em?
Quiet, all of you.
He don't want 'em!
Oh.
Anybody else want my job?
Eh?
No.
Eh? Anybody wanna take my job?
Juanita, you heard your mother. Home.
C'mon. Home. Come on!
Wooley!
Look at that.
Not a man in town who'd dare lay a hand on him.
Jim, are you thinking the same thing I am?
I am.
There you are, Chester.
Now you can take your place with the famous sheriffs of the West.
Why didn't you hire one of them? They're all dead.
They're all dead? Dead!
Don't worry, Chester.
Keep this picture and show it when you have to,
and you'll bear a charmed life.
Suppose I should happen to meet some nearsighted gunman?
That'll be his tough luck. Oh, I see.
If he kills me, he'll have to take care of the widow.
That would make him a dead duck.
And me too.
Where's the sheriff?
Where's the sheriff?
There's gonna be lead flyin'.
Some drunk's fixin' for a fight.
Chester?
Where'd he go?
He went thataway.
Chester, get up.
This is your big chance.
Tell 'em to stop the shooting, or you'll run 'em all in! Show 'em you're not afraid.
Throw out your chest.
They'll fill it full of holes.
Go ahead! Don't push!
All right, don't push.
I didn't get this badge for nothin'.
Go ahead.
That boy's got what it takes. I don't wanna go.
I'll go!
You get us some law and order, Wooley, and we'll get the railroad to come through Wagon Gap yet!
I'm donating you in the interest of good government.
Me and the family are with you. I'm depending on it.
Oh, yes.
Ohhh.
Mrs. Hawkins? Oh, go on down there and act like a sheriff, or I'll send you to the ranch and really put you to work. All right.
Law and order.
If you had any nerve, you'd go in there and stop them yourself.
If this doesn't work... You'll think of something else for somebody else to do.
I'm in town for a good time, see?
I'll blast your heads off! Stop disgracin' me!
Haven't you got any red blood in your veins? Yes, and I'm gonna keep it there.
Go on in!
Don't move, anybody.
If you're tired oflivin', we'll shoot it out.
I don't want another word outta any of you!
Oh, no, you don't!
Now you fellows in here will have to stop shootin'... because you're makin' a lot of noise.
The horses are jumpin' up and down, scarin' the women.
Now remember... don't aggravate me.
No more shootin'.
Now look, everybody!
This shooting has gotta stop.
Hey, little boy.
You! Fat little boy.
You!
Come here, little boy.
What're you doin' wearing a man's pants?
I'm the new sheriff.
I want law and order.
You take care of the law, and I'll order.
What'll you have? I don't drink whiskey. It goes to my head.
That's just great.
I'll put it on your head, and I'll shoot it off.
That's much better.
The other way I get sick.
What am I sayin'? Get it back up there, or I'll drill you!
Mister, please don't.
I didn't want this mess.
I didn't ask to be sheriff.
It's all her fault.
Go ahead and shoot me.
You can have her.
The Widow Hawkins.!
That drunk I'm not.
Everybody up! Everybody up! You heard...
Shut up. Get those tables up. Yes, sir.
Put your shootin'irons on the table.
Get 'em up there.!
Hey, you, get this roof fixed!
You heard the sheriff.
Get this roof... Shut up.!
From now on, I want you all to treat me with respect... and very little of that.
Go on back to your tables.
You heard the sheriff.
Shut up!
Yes, sir.
Go on!
You heard the sheriff!
Land sakes, he's done it.
That's my boy. You can all go back to your homes.
There'll be no more shootin' in Wagon Gap.
The sawed-off runt's scared.
What sawed-off runt are you calling a sawed-off runt?
You, fatso. Any objections? Yeah!
Oh, I must've meant somebody else.
I guess you did.
Yeah.
Here.
You're too young to smoke cigarettes!
Just a minute.
I don't want you calling anybody a sawed-off runt, or I'll run you outta town.
And I'm the sawed-off runt that can do it too! Yes, sir.
Chester, you're wonderful!
I'm proud of you. Ma'am, while
I'm wearing this badge of office,
I'll have no huggin' and chalkin' in public.
And another thing, that goes for any other place too.
Mr. Wooley,
I'm apologizing.
Don't let it happen again, ma'am. I won't, Chester.
See what I mean?
I'm not to be trifled with.
I wouldn't overdo it. If you get the widow mad, she'll really pour it on.
Oh. So you're still hangin' around... tryin' to tell me what to do. Oh, now...
Listen, you! If you don't start working and show some means of support,
I'm gonna run you in as a vagrant! Chester, I'm your pal.
You owe everything to me.
And I'm a man that pays off.
I'm gonna start paying you off.
I'm gonna make you my deputy.
You really are my pal! You like that?
Swell. Your first duty is get to the ranch and take over my chores.
Me? Yes, you! You've been bossing me around long enough.
The worm has turned, and every dog has his day.
Now get out! Just a minute. Ohhh!
Partner, when you say that, smile.
Morning, Sheriff.
Good morning, Sheriff.
Good morning, ladies.
Howdy, Sheriff.
Hello, Joe.
Juanita, how are you?
Where's your mama?
She just came into town.
She's right over there.
Good-bye.
Yoo-hoo.! Sheriff Wooley.
I brought your dinner.
It's roast beef today. Just when
I was in the mood for chicken!
Now... I got chicken stewin' for supper.
I'll send Eagan back... Never mind, no need. Roast beef will do.
You wait here for me. I'm going to the saloon to stop them from fighting.
They're not fighting. I know, but why wait until the last minute?
I'll be right back. I've gotta see somebody about something.
Hey, there's the sheriff.
The sheriff!
The sheriff.
You don't all have to stop talkin' on account of me. Then c'mon, boys.
Shut up!
What'd you say?
I didn't say nothin'.
Well, don't say it again.
C'mon, folks, everybody have a good time!
Enjoy yourselves. But don't nobody sneak up behind me.
Put the gun away! Chester, the widow is working me to death.
So? We've gotta get out of town. Tonight, you arrest me.
Then we can get away while the town's asleep.
You like that? Only the part about putting you in jail.
You're starting to like it? Yes.
Being sheriff has its advantages.
Listen, Chester. Get your hands off me. Get 'em off!
Ahem.
I've had enough of your flirting.
If another man even looks at you, I'll kill him.
Why, you...
Hello, Sheriff.
Have another one.
It's on me.
Chester, you're living in a fool's paradise.
It's not you they're afraid of, it's the widow.
And speaking of the widow, she's out to marry you or else.
Or else what? Or else she'll find somebody else to marry.
Then what? Without her protection, you'd just be another little fat man... and a lovely target for these men you've been pushing around.
Who would want to marry the widow?
Who? Who? Nobody.
C'mon, everybody.
Drinks are on the sheriff!
Who would marry the widow?
Judge, sit down and have a drink.
It's a little crowded over there. But it's free at the bar.
Bartender, milk for everybody. Milk?
What's the matter?
Any objections?
Milk!
Milk. I should've listened to you in the first place.
I have something else I think you'd like to listen to.
Have you heard the news about the railroad coming through the widow's property?
No.
They're buying her property for a right-of-way.
You don't say.
That'll probably make her the richest woman in the state.
Hmm.
Bottoms up.
Bottoms up!
Drink up. This stuff will ruin a man's stomach.
So will this.
Looks like the little fat boy is gonna keep dealing us misery.
Worry about him later. Right now, we've got the stage to think of.
Hey, Duke.
What's the matter?
What day is today?
Wednesday.
I thought so.
Jim, is Frame and his gang gonna be fooled!
What're you getting at? You know you told me the gold was comin' in tomorrow?
I told 'em it was coming in today.
Pretty smart, huh?
Send 'em on a wild-goose chase.
The gold is coming today! What?
That wild-goose chase of yours is gonna lay a golden egg... for Frame.
Head off the stage before it reaches Dead Man's Pass.
I'll round up the men and follow.
I get it.
We stop the stage.
The bandits are waiting for the stage.
And then you show up instead of the stage. That's well-staged.
Exactly.! Providing you reach the stage.
Don't worry. I ain't got that for nothin'.
Madam, you'll have to get down off that buckboard. We're after the bandits.
C'mon, you'll have to make it snappy.
What do you mean we're going after the bandits?
You wanna play tag with the bandits, go ahead.
Just a minute.
Take it easy.
I deputized you, didn't I?
Now get in there.
Wooley, I'm agin the whole idea.
When you start ridin' by those bandits, they're liable to start shootin'.
Don't worry. They're not crazy. Well, I am worried.
I'm just sentimental enough not to want my intended shot up.
Madam, it's about time you and I had an understanding.
You may be intending, but I'm not.
Now step aside and let me do my duty! Don't rile me!
It's me protecting you. If you want to keep that protection, you better be thinking about us gettin' wed.
I got all the protection
I need... right here.
Go home before I throw you in the hoosegow for tryin' to scare the sheriff.
Mrs. Hawkins, I've been considering making you a proposition.
Ain't got time, Judge. I can wait.
Wedding bells and train whistles... most melodious.
Yes, indeedy.
What're you slowin' down for?
Let's not pass up this chance.
We have horses and a wagon.
Nobody's watching.
California's out that way. What kind of a sheriff do you think I am?
I was put in office to uphold the law.
You're my deputy, and you're gonna help me!
Sure, the bandits might not shoot you, but it's open season on me.
You got nothin' to worry about.
You're safe as long as
I've got this picture.
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
The picture's gone.
Gone?
It's gone.
Duke, don't go another step.
Hold the horses.
Don't go no further, Duke.
The bandits are right down that road. Should I keep going?
No. No!
Duke, which way does that road go?
To California.
California?
California.
Over there.
The widow.!
Just had a faint notion... you'd be heading this way once you found the picture gone.
Let's ride back together.
You and me can discuss terms for keepin' my protection.
What do you say? Giddyap!
Mr. Wooley?
Mr. Wooley!
Hurry up.
Get down off of there.
Keep your hands up.
Get over here.
Frame.
Frame!
The sheriff!
Mr. Wooley?
Mr. Wooley!
The widow!
Giddyap!
Wooley!
Now we lost the gold. Why didn't you shoot the sheriff?
Why didn't you?
Me?
And have her chasin' me instead of him? Uh-uh!
Where's the sheriff?
It's here, Jim.
He did it!
He saved the gold! If I wouldn't have seen it, I wouldn't have believed it.
Aw, shucks.
It was nothing.
I went for my guns, and they went for the hills. Or vice versa. Wooley.!
Wooley. Wooley!
You're a hero.
I seen it with my own eyes.
You don't need my picture to be brave. How'd...
But I'd like you to have it, Chester, to keep close to your heart.
Thank you, ma'am.
I sure will.
Those bandits were Frame and his gang! I recognized 'em.
This is it. They're probably on their way back to the Round-Up.
Phil, take a bunch of men and ride ahead. We're gonna get 'em.
There's no need of bloodshed.
I'm gonna bring that gang in single-handed. You're only one man!
There's only one gang.
I'll see you all later.
What happened? How do you get outta here? Get on your horse.
Fine bunch of softheaded idiots I tied in with.
I didn't notice you taking a shot at him. Leaving town, I see.
It's all your fault.
You and your laws!
That sheriff's got everyone hog-tied.
Not necessarily. If someone would marry the widow, that would relieve the culprit of his responsibilities, also his power.
Any of you boys want to cut yourselves in? I'd rather leave.
I was speaking of myself. I thought you could hold your liquor.
I'm cold sober, Jake. It's just I desire to settle down in my declining years.
Although the money the little woman will receive from the railroad...
which is coming through her property...
has a slight attraction.
So that's it.
If anybody's in line for that money, it's me.
As the one who really killed
Hawkins, it's high time I confessed.
I'll thank you to appoint me the family guardian. No deal, Jake.
That's hearsay testimony, and I can't accept it as evidence.
I'll shoot the butterball and inherit the family from him!
You'll have to beat me to it.
Hey, the sheriff is coming to take you in.
Order! If we're not careful, we'll be shooting each other.
The judge is right.
It's every man for himself.
But the shot closest to the heart wins.
To avoid argument, mark your bullets.
This thing's got to be done nice and legal.
Wait a minute!
Chester, go on in there, but bring 'em out alive.
Don't worry 'bout me.
Worry about yourselves.
Take cover. I don't want any of you gettin' hurt.
Go on, take cover!
Here's to the widow. And her money.
May the best shot win.
Here's where I get rich.
I never missed a sheriff in my life. Here's to it!
Hey!
Here he comes.
Frame, you and your gang come out with your hands up, or I'm a-comin' in a-shootin'!
Now listen, Frame, someone is liable to get hurt!
Those dirty skunks, shootin' at Mr. Wooley!
Isn't it about time somebody on our side used a gun? It is.
Phil, take 10 men and break in through the back.
Come with me. We'll draw their fire to keep 'em up front.
Wooley, you stay here with the women. Thanks.
Jim Simpson and the Citizens' Committee.
Barricade the doors and windows.
Get back here, you yellow-livered skunks!
This brawl's gonna decide who runs this town, and it's time you started picking sides.
Unless something or somebody draws their attention,
Jim and them fellers are goners!
I'll do it! They won't dare shoot a woman.
No. You have a family to think of.
Chester here'll do it.
Shut up!
But I didn't say...
I didn't say anything.
That's in case you do.
Duke, tell Phil to hurry.
Jim needs help.
When Chester gets there, they'll stop shooting atJim, but I'll go.
You sure this is gonna work?
Even Frame wouldn't shoot a woman.
Why don't we all go? That's a good...
Wooley, get goin'.
Pick up the clubs, girls.
Lead the way, Wooley.
Go on, lead the way!
Hold your fire, men.
Hold it.
Hold your fire!
You women go home where you belong. This is a man's fight.
All right, girls. Forward.
Frame, we're coming in.
The sheriff.
Ohhh!
Hey... Hey...
Hawkins.
Duke!
Oh!
I'll show you we'll have law and order in this place.
Oh, you poor little thing.
Frame!
Come on.
Come on.
You might as well quit, boys.
You're all through in this town.
Corral 'em all and take 'em to the hoosegow.
I'll see that you all get life and maybe longer!
The federal marshal will take care of that.
We're ridin' the bunch into Butte to turn 'em over.
Okay, you got my permission.
C'mon, everybody.
You better come along.
I wanna talk to you.
Mr. Wooley, the citizens of Wagon
Gap are deeply indebted to you.
You're a fine man, and you've been carrying another man's burden.
Frame just confessed he was the man that killed Hawkins.
Chester, at last we're on our way.
Mr. Wooley, I was kinda hoping you might have reconsidered... about hitchin' up. California, here I come.
In that case,
Judge Benbow,
I accept your proposal of marriage.
Let's go.
Just a minute.
Judge, in regards to the railroad...
How'd you know? Just got the offer this morning.
It's gonna make me the richest woman in these parts.
You chump. If you'd a-married the widow, we wouldn't have had to work the rest of our lives.
You wouldn't, but she have found somethin' for me. You never do anything right.
I don't? Didn't I clean up all the bandits?
Didn't I make the town of Wagon
Gap safe for women and children?
So safe that nobody even has to carry a gun?
Giddyap!

Oh, how lovely!
- Come on in.
- All right.
I'll sit there.
- Where do you want this?
- Well, up here, I guess.
All right.
Where's your luggage and everything?
- Greg has it.
- Greg?
He stopped to get me something to read.
Brought me down in a taxi.
Wasn't that nice of him?
Oh, I don't know.
You don't like Greg, do you?
I hate him.
Malcolm, why can't we all be friends?
- Because I hate him.
- Malcolm!
I put the other bag in the luggage compartment, honey.
- Thank you. Greg.
- Hi, Malcolm.
- Nice to see you. How've you been?
- Fine, thanks.
This is for you, honey.
- A guide to the west.
- Oh, wonderful!
- 350 illustrations.
- Really?
- You don't say?
- You know, I always think it's... it's interesting to see things you've only seen pictures of before.
Gives you a kick.
You know what I mean?
Pardon me, Malcolm.
I'll get this up here.
- Can I help you with that?
- No, I'll manage, thanks.
- What's all this?
- Oh, that's a present from Malcolm.
Isn't it lovely?
Yeah. Better not eat too much of it, though.
That'll make you sick.
Looks like you're out west already.
Yeah.
Molly? Malcolm? No, thank you.
No, thanks.
Gee, you look swell, Molly.
Doesn't she, Malcolm?
That's what I always tell her.
Well, I guess it's these flowers.
Mr. MacGarnigal gave them to me.
Oh.
Nice old guy, MacGarnigal. Yeah.
- Hey, Duchess, where are you?
- Hello, Bob.
Oh, I see we have a quorum here.
How are you men, anyway?
Fine.
Nice to see you. Here, Duchess.
Eat your head off.
Oh, thank you!
Oh, you shouldn't have done it.
Ah, don't be silly.
Uh, put it up there next to the other one, will you? Sure.
Mine. Excuse me, please.
You'll pardon us. I'm glad I'm here anyway.
I didn't think I was gonna make it for a while. I'm up on the road with my taxi...
Don't tell us about it. No.
Is there anything I can do for you?
Yeah. Get married.
Listen, brother... I'm not gonna have you acting like this.
Well, I... well, I-I guess you'd better be going.
Well, good-bye, Molly.
Good-bye.
And, uh, think it over.
You know, about what we were talking about the other night?
Yes, I will.
Good-bye.
Molly...
Yes, Greg.
Good-bye, Bob.
So long, Duchess.
- Good-bye, boys.
- Good-bye.
Good-bye, watch out for snakes.
Yeah, all kinds.
Honey, do you mind if I ask you a question?
Why, no.
Go ahead.
What are you going away for?
Oh... I hope you don't think I'm forward for speaking first, but after all, one of us had to speak first, so what's the difference which one?
My name's
Molly J. Truesdale.
Florrie Bendix.
How do you do?
Glad to know you.
Glad to know you.
How are you enjoying the trip so far?
Oh, fine.
Not me.
I wish I'd have known.
I bet I wouldn't have come.
Why not?
Why not?
Look at the no fellas.
That's all right with me.
Hello, everybody. Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.
I'd like to have your attention for a minute.
You're gonna have mine for the next 14 days.
So it isn't asking for too much, is it?
No, that's what I thought.
I'd like to introduce myself to you.
My name is smiley Lambert.
But you folks can call me smiley Lambert.
That's pretty cute, isn't it?
How are you? Good to see you.
All set for 14 breathless days?
Doesn't mean you have to hold your breath, now does it?
How are you, sir? Glad to see you.
Yes, sir, a big, happy family.
The idea is not to get in each other's hair.
Hair today, gone tomorrow,
I always say.
Got an idea you don't like me, brother.
Well, I'll grow on you.
Yes, sir, grow on you. How are you, girls?
Having fun?
Good to see you. How are you? Well, look at this little man here.
All set for a nice, little trip?
You're all right, Sonny.
We've got... Well. Sex appeal, folks, right over here.
Yes, sir. Sex appeal. Oh, you pretty, pretty, pretty.
Well, we'll be leaving in about two minutes...
Change seats with me, will you?
I certainly don't blame you.
This is the old necking department, folks, in case anybody's interested.
We used to call this a saloon. Everybody came here here for scotch and "sofa."
You're right with me, ain't ya?
Right with me all the time.
Now, folks, we'll be off for the smoothest, most comfortable ride you ever had.
Yes, sir, the easiest, smoothest, most comfortable ride you ever had.
And I'm the boy that's gonna tell you about it. Okay, major. Let her go.
- Contact!
Hot dog?
No.
Are you all right?
I, uh, guess so.
Folks, it was a happy landing...
You sure you ain't busted no place?
Uh, well, I'm pretty sure.
Okay.
Hey, Duke.
Are we all right?
Sure, sure, Waco.
We ain't hurt?
We ain't even shook up.
If we woulda rode that other horse, we'd have taken the day money.
Yep.
We sure woulda.
Hey, mister.
Oh, hello.
Would you mind giving me your autograph? My what?
Would you sign my program? I want to keep it as a souvenir.
I don't mind.
"Duke Hudkins."
Thank you very much,
Mr. Hudkins.
I, uh... I don't get sat on every day.
Well, good-bye.
Hey, lady!
You want to sign my program?
Me? Well, gee whiz, Mr. Hudkins,
I don't...
I don't sit on people every day.
Oh... sure.
This is, uh, pretty fancy.
I don't know whether you can read it or not.
"Molly J. Truesdale."
Let's go, Molly.
What? Well, you like beer, don't you?
Well, isn't it funny what can happen...
Just because somebody...
Happens to sit on somebody?
Where are you from?
The east.
Is that so?
Where are you from?
West.
Is that so?
Whoopee!
♪ Oh, if you're troubled by the blues watch those swingin' feet ♪
♪ They'll have you dancing in your shoes,
I'm telling you buddy, they can't be beat ♪
♪ King of swing you sing with me promise not to abdicate ♪
♪ Fall in line and don't be late ♪
♪ Stayin' and swayin' and singin' and swingin' and yeah ♪
Two beers.
Coming up.
Well, I must say...
This is certainly an extra added attraction.
How's that?
Well, there was nothing like this included in "all expenses paid."
Do you mind if I feel your arm?
Go ahead.
That's what I thought.
Well, here's to ya.
Maybe you don't like beer.
Oh, no.
No?
Oh, no, no, I mean...
This is fine.
You know, I think it's...
I think it's nice for two people to just...
Sit and talk, don't you?
Yeah, if they have something to... talk about.
Gee, you must have...
Just about a million things to talk about.
Well, sure. I have.
Thank you.
Uh...
Waco, come here.
- I want you to meet my better half.
- Anything you say, Duke.
Waco, this here's Molly.
Sit down, sit down.
Good to see you, Molly. How have you been?
Uh, just fine.
I, uh... I don't believe
I got your name.
Waco, like in Texas.
That's very interesting.
How did they happen to name you after a place in Texas?
Other way around. They named the place after me.
Oh, really? Biggest liar in the world.
Tell her a lie, Waco. Oh, ho, ho, ho.
Well, let me see.
Uh... oh. I never would have figured the time we all slept in one bed.
Hiya, Linda belle. Why, you bowlegged hunk of nothin'.
How you doin', Duke? Good.
Sit down, sit down.
Yes, sir. Here we were, in an old bed.
Molly, I want you to meet an old, old friend of mine, Linda Belle.
How do you do?
Howdy, Molly.
It was a folding bed... Why do you want to make out for I'm so old?
Why, you've been hanging around here since they fought Indians.
Speaking about Indians, that reminds me of a story.
You hear tell about the old Indian custom of scalping white people?
Well, I introduced the custom of white people scalping Indians.
Really? Yes, ma'am, and the first occasion...
Took place not more than a hundred feet from where you're sitting.
Well, maybe 200. Hiya, Duke.
What cooks?
Well, what do you know?
Lill and Carmencita.
Sit down, sit down.
More beer! You know, as I was saying...
Molly, I want you to know Carmencita.
And Lilly. How do you do?
How do you do?
Lill, this here's Molly.
Howdy, Molly.
Molly, as I was a-sayin', this here injun seen me comin'...
So he up with his tomahawk! Say, what's the idea of giving me the brushoff?
Peg, sit down. I threw my bowie knife right straight at him.
Duke, you old snakebite.
Sit down. Sit down!
More beer!
What's the matter?
What's the matter? What do you think, what's the matter?
Well, I don't know what I think what's the matter.
Well, then, it just doesn't matter.
I take a girl places, it's kind of unusual she don't have a good time.
I butted in.
Oh, you did not.
Well, to tell you the truth, Mr. Hudkins, this isn't what
I came out west for.
It's just that I've been sitting on that bus for so long, and you don't know how big this country is...
Until you've got to cross it in a sitting position.
Then, I don't know, you came along, and I just thought...
Maybe I'd have some fun.
Sorry you didn't.
I'm sorry too.
Would you like to have another chance?
All right.
Oh, tension!
Oh, no, no, no.
Wait till he pays off.
Now...
Ones, dice!
Oh, little Joe, once!
Four! We win!
A four? Yeah. You see...
I'll explain later.
How much money we get?
We-we've got $283.
Are you sure?
Yes.
Here we go.
Coming out.
77 once, dice!
Come on, buddy. You're holding up the game.
What'll it be?
Shoot the bundle.
You mean all of it?
Sure.
A buck he's right.
You got it.
Hey.
What?
What's the matter?
You gonna start betting against it?
Oh! Oh!
Changed my mind.
Hold it, fella.
You got troubles?
No. I just want to tell you the house rules.
Like what? Like we've got a $25 limit here.
Oh, since when?
Hold it, brother.
Pick up your money, and let's play nice, huh?
All right.
Give me paper for this.
Why don't you let the lady roll?
Be a gentleman, hmm?
Molly, sure.
Go ahead. Roll 'em.
Uh, well, I'll try my best.
Yeah.
Shooting 15 only.
Yeah, well, how do you know until you... Honest.
Shooting the five only.
Shooting a buck.
And she rolled snake eyes.
See?
Don't ever leave me, Molly.
Don't ever leave me.
You know, it really pays to have a good time with you.
Oh, say, what time is it?
Maybe I'd better be getting back to my bus.
Oh, it's early yet.
Shot of Irish.
Right. Two?
No, no.
I'll have, uh...
I'll have cactus milk, please.
Cactus milk.
Did you ever see 'em milk a cactus?
How's about it? How's about it?
How's about it?
- How about what?
- My rye-ginger ale.
- You didn't order any.
- Wanna make something out of it?
Oh, no, sir.
Boy, you look too tough for me.
How'd you like to step outside?
- How are ya?
- Never better.
- Never better?
- No.
Hey, you're pretty lucky.
Can't lose, eh?
- No.
- Well...
You ain't foolin' me, big boy.
You're just lucky on account of your little girl makes you lucky.
Well, you got something there.
Where is she?
I took all his dough and flew the Coop.
What's you say?
I said she took all my dough and flew the Coop.
W... why don't you lend me... that lucky girl of yours for a few minutes?
- I'd like to win something.
- You don't want to do that.
You want to go out and find your own little old lucky girl.
- That's just what I said.
- Sure.
Why don't you lend me that lucky girl?
- You can't lose.
- I can't lose.
Oh, he's all right.
Just having a good time.
So am I, Duke.
So am I.
Well...
Well...
What's the matter?
Are you all right?
You want a glass of water?
Jeepers!
What was that?
Cactus milk.
Well, jeepers!
What was in it?
Tequila, applejack, gin and cactus milk.
Jeepers! Gosh, you really had me scared.
Shaking like a leaf. Give me another shot of Irish.
Right. Anything for you, lady?
Cactus milk.
Make it snappy.
Well, here's your fortune, you little old lucky fella.
I'll show you that little old lucky girl.
Come on. Blow some luck on these for me.
Come on. Hey.
That's enough.
Are you all right, honey?
See you later.
Thank you.
- We're not leaving, are we?
- Think we'd better.
Liable to be some rough stuff here tonight.
Heads up!
You all right, Duke?
Okay.
My better half.
Well. Well, I think this is just about...
The most interesting evening I've ever spent.
Oh, it was nothing.
You got the time?
You're okay.
You, uh, married?
Well, if I was, do you think I'd be doing this?
Why?
What are you doing?
Well, this.
You're not married?
Of course not.
I don't want you to get the idea...
That I've never been asked, because I have.
What happened?
Oh, I just never met the right fella, that's all.
- You married?
- No.
'Course, I don't want to give the impression I ever asked anybody.
Why not?
Don't believe in it.
Well, lots of people are married.
They seem to like it fine.
No, they don't. They just make out they like it...
'Cause they're ashamed to admit they made a mistake.
I was...
Just been thinking.
I wish instead of this old hay wagon being here,
I wish it'd been your horse.
Hmm? We'd have landed on him...
And gone riding someplace.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Riding through the night like the wind.
What's your horse's name?
Sammy.
Sammy.
Well, that's a wonderful name for a horse.
Heigh-ho, Sammy.
Heigh-ho, Sammy.
I got a horse too.
No foolin'?
What's his name?
Gwendolyn.
Gwendolyn?
Must be a mighty fancy animal.
Oh, she is.
She's white.
White all over, except for a little splotch right here.
Nice.
Yeah.
You should see her go riding through the night.
Yeah?
I never seen an eastern horse yet that was...
Any good for roping.
Gwendolyn can do anything.
Oh? How high can Sammy jump, for instance?
Well, I don't know. I...
Well, I don't mean it as any reflection on Sammy, of course, but Gwendolyn can jump ten feet.
Holy smokes!
Straight up.
Can she run?
She can even run backwards.
Backwards? Well, not very fast, of course.
Oh, she's wonderful.
Her... her nose is like velvet.
And her coat...
Is so soft...
And her eyes...
You ought to see her eyes.
They're...
Well, they're like hamburgers.
Lady, that's a lot of horse.
Where do you keep her?
In my head.
She's the loveliest white horse...
That ever was.
With that... that little splotch right here.
Of course, the only...
The only trouble with Gwendolyn is...
Nobody can see her but me.
When did I ever meet a girl like you?
Where did I ever meet a...
Fella like you?
I, uh...
I think we better go...
Put me on my bus.
Let's go.
I, uh... I think we better go.
All right.
Let's go.
Yeah, I think we'd better.
We're early.
Yeah, I guess.
I'm always early for buses.
Trains too.
It's just the way I am.
It's a good way to be.
If, uh, you ever come east to New York, why...
Well, sure, I-I will.
You got a pencil?
No, I... I...
Oh, well, I got one.
Plaza 3-3098.
Plaza...
If, uh, you call about
5:00, I'll be there.
Oh, I may not be heading east for a year, maybe.
Oh, well...
Well, I'll be there if you call around 5:00.
All right.
I wonder where my bus is.
Uh, maybe it's around back.
Maybe if we’d ask somebody.
Hey! My suitcase!
What? Where?
In there, on the floor.
Do you suppose that bus went and left before 10:00?
How do you know that's your suitcase?
My pajamas are hanging out.
I always leave my pajamas hanging out so I'll know which one is mine.
Lookit, mister... Are you the lady with rainbow tours?
What happened to my bus?
Well, here's your suitcase.
What's the idea of them going off before 10:00 like they said?
Huh? 10:00...
You must've been having a right good time, lady.
What am I gonna do?
They said to tell you...
You can catch the bus when it gets to coming back.
Back? Yep. Comes back through gold city.
Gold city? We're playing there
Thursday, Friday and Saturday.
Well, she can catch her bus there Saturday, 8:00 A.M.
But I'll miss the Columbia gorge, the pacific ocean, the Puget sound.
And the waterfalls of seven delights.
Lots of folks has missed 'em.
Me and Waco, we're driving to gold city tomorrow.
All that ways across the country.
What do I get for it?
Gold city.
Good night, lady.
You got hay on ya.
You just...
You just don't know,
Duke, how I've been...
Counting on the waterfalls of seven delights.
Oh, they ain't anything.
Yeah, I know, but when you haven't even...
Seen a waterfall with one delight...
Well, I guess...
I'd better go look for a hotel.
You may have a little trouble.
What?
This here being a rodeo town, the hotels are usually full.
But you're gonna have my room.
Oh, where will you sleep?
I don't usually have much trouble.
Duke.
Hmm?
I just wish all ladies in distress...
Could meet up with fellas like you.
Let's go.
I feel very conspicuous.
Hey, chief.
A bottle and two glasses.
How many?
Give me two.
This is a very nice hotel.
Glad you like it.
We're giving up our room, Waco.
That's awfully nice of him.
Yeah.
Well, Duke, I...
I just can't tell you how wonderful you've been, and...
I'll help you.
Oh, no, don't bother.
I can do this later.
Nice hanging closet here.
Plenty of room.
Yeah.
Well, it's just been wonderful.
You don't know how...
We'd better get the wrinkles out of these...
Oh, no. I'll...
I'll do it.
A swell chiffonier.
Plenty of drawer space.
Room for all your little, uh, things.
Come in!
Duke!
Duke!
Gee, you look beautiful.
Duke!
Well, what's the matter?
Well, what's the matter? Well, what do you think, what's the matter?
Well, I don't know what's the matter.
Just trying to kiss you.
Where are you going? I can sleep in the park, can't I?
All they got there is bears and hyenas.
Fine old park.
Stay here.
I'll get. I can always drink by myself.
Hop in. We're going to gold city.
Never mind.
- Oh, come on. Hop in.
- No, thank you.
She's wacky.
Why?
Because she said no?
She ain't my type.
Too suspicious.
Mighty pretty.
She's wacky.
I got to admit, Duke, I feel kind of sorry for the poor little critter.
All alone.
Big, heavy suitcase.
She don't want to ride with us.
As far as I'm concerned, she can take her... Where is she from?
I don't know.
New York City someplace.
Well, as the man said,
"east is east and west is west, and never the two should meet."
Or something.
Shut up.
Hop in.
Thank you very much.
Ahh!
I'll never forget the time... Clean up the tinware, will you, Waco?
Oh, anything you say, Duke.
Lookit, Miss Truesdale, is there any good reason for you and me...
To sit around here insulting each other?
I insulted you, Mr. Hudkins?
I'm sorry.
Quit calling me
Mr. Hudkins.
Anything else I could call you, Mr. Hudkins, would hardly be appropriate for a lady to utter.
Lovely night.
Yeah.
Dishes all washed?
Well, they ain't exactly washed, but they won't draw flies, I guess.
I remember way back...
Time to bed down.
Hope you don't mind sleeping on the same desert with me.
He's pretty fresh, isn't he?
Well, he's in the open air all the time.
Funny. Last night for a while...
I thought he was just about the nicest fellow I'd ever met.
He generally has that effect on 'em at first.
Here, Waco.
Go on, beat it.
What's the matter with him?
Showing off, that's all.
Jealous.
Easy, boy.
Whoa, Sammy.
Got yourself all excited for nothing, didn't you?
Now, go on, relax.
Good night, boy.
Aren't you gonna put a rope on him?
How'd you like to have me put a rope on you? I wouldn't!
Well?
Well, I'm not a horse.
What's the difference?
Plenty!
Not about a thing like that, there ain't.
Well, I guess it's all in the way you look at it.
Anything that ties you down is no good.
Like a steady job, or if I owned a ranch.
Well... well, I thought every cowboy wanted to own a ranch someday.
Every cowboy?
Not me.
Think if I owned a ranch. Could I go where I want when I want to?
Or do?
Well, I guess not.
Think of instead of just Sammy,
I owned 20 horses.
I'd be in the horse business.
I don't like any business
'cept the one I'm in.
What's that?
Livin' the way I like to.
By myself.
It's great. You ought to try it sometime.
No.
I don't think so.
It's sounds lonesome.
Maybe.
But me,
I don't like ropes.
Good night.
Good night.
Say, could you...
I'm sorry, Sammy, but it's either you or me.
You're bigger.
Wh-what's that?
Sammy!
What did you do with your blanket, you doggone fool?
What's all the commotion?
Holy smoke.
Waco!
Waco!
Sammy sneezed!
Pack the car!
By gum, I thought it was injuns.
Get goin'. We got to get to gold city and fast.
Come on, boy.
Get in the trailer.
Of all the silly...
Sammy!
God bless you.
No respect for nothin'.
Stealing a horse's blanket.
Sammy sneezes.
No breakfast, no lunch.
Ain't you afraid you'll lose your bus?
Doesn't come till tomorrow.
Never saw such a fuss made... just because a horse sneezes.
After all, it's just a cold in the nose.
I've had plenty of colds in the nose.
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting for so long.
I don't mind.
It's just...
You've got a pretty sick horse, mister.
I thought first, maybe it was just a cold.
Maybe it is.
I-I can't be sure yet.
Easy. There's no use beating around the bush.
Maybe pneumonia's started, and maybe not.
If it hasn't, he ought to be okay.
But if it has, well, there ain't much I can do.
I can't tell you yet just what the chances are.
I'll be taking X-rays and smears and...
Why don't you come back here...
Around 5:00 or 5:00 this afternoon.
Then either he'll be okay, or, uh...
Or we'll know.
You got a fine horse, mister.
Well, I'll be doing everything I can.
Gettin' late, Duke.
Better go.
Wish it was me that was sick instead of him.
I could tell him where it hurts.
He can't.
Oh, Duke.
It was all my fault.
If anything should happen,
I don't know what I could do to...
It's all right, Molly.
It's been nice knowin' ya.
I was right about him.
He's the most unusual man I ever met.
Sure is.
He certainly is the right fella for the right girl. Yeah.
Hey, Molly.
I... I'm not leaving just yet.
You better. No, you go on.
I'll stay here.
If anything happens,
I'll let Duke know.
Molly, I want to give you a little advice.
What?
- Go home.
- I'm going home tomorrow.
Go now.
Why?
Molly, I'm an old man, and I like you.
But I know Duke, and I know women, all kinds.
I know your kind.
You're a fine gal, but if you don't watch out, you're gonna get your heart broke.
Love is the best thing there is, I guess, but you're barking up the wrong cowboy.
Any fella that can love a horse can love a girl.
Betcha.
Betcha.
Watch for the twist down now.
Here comes the fall to the ground, and he's put him down.
Try to watch him he don't stick down his head. He ain't too trusting.
- What time is it?
- Oh, you got another hour.
What time is it?
- Ten after 4:00.
- Then we ain't got another hour.
He said 5:00, didn't he?
Okay, okay.
And kinda watch him you don't drift to the left.
- Just keep an eye on him.
- I'll handle him. Thanks.
It's nothin' at all, Duke.
I'm sorry about Sammy.
- I heard about Sammy.
- Yeah?
When are you going to know?
Pretty soon.
Here's your next bulldogger,
Duke Hudkins.
High-mounted well, placing his horse in now behind the barrier.
Time is a-ready, flags going up.
- You ready?
- with the steers on its side.
- Unchain him.
Duke! Duke!
- Duke.
- What is it?
- Sammy's...
- Sammy's what?
- Sammy's...
- There he goes!
And watch this one.
Here he goes.
The jump, and he...
Jeepers! Duke!
- Sammy's what?
- He's okay!
Okay? The vet says he's gonna be all right.
Waco, he's okay.
Glory be!
Well, don't start crying, Molly.
There's nothing to cry about.
Come on! Oh, see slim gets his horse, will you, Waco?
That Humboldt's a good doctor.
He sure got Sammy feeling frisky in a hurry.
He's the man I want to see if I ever get sick.
Come on!
Hiya, boy.
Waco says to tell ya he's waitin' for ya down at the restaurant.
Got so hungry, he couldn't wait no more.
Oh, friend of mine.
How do you do?
How do?
Have you a vacancy?
Haven't got a thing, lady.
Oh, dear.
Oh, I was hoping you might have.
Yeah.
It's just for overnight.
You sure?
Oh, yes. You see, my bus...
Well, I got a party comin' into number 12 about noon tomorrow.
Oh, I'd be out by then.
Okay.
Course, if you change your mind,
I can't help ya.
Oh, no. You see my bus...
I have to...
Yeah. It's the fifth one over, right next to Duke's.
Oh, thank you.
You're welcome.
Want to go downtown and have some supper?
You mean right now?
Oh, Waco's waitin', and...
Well, I thought we might eat later.
- Oh!
- Hey, Duke!
Where you been?
I been a-waitin'.
I'm not hungry.
You look hungry.
- Uh, we're going to eat here.
- Where?
Right here. We're going to have a little home-cooked dinner for a change.
Yeah. Is there a grocery store near here?
No.
Find her one, will you, Waco?
I gotta get cleaned up.
I'll go get the car. I'll be with you in a minute.
I want four nice
Iamb chops, please.
Your a-move.
Uh, look, could I have four nice lamb chops, please?
Josephine!
Well, I'll be gosh-darned.
- You sure look different.
- Well, I...
My name's not Josephine.
You changed your name, too, huh?
My gosh, you kids.
- You think I'm somebody else.
- What's the matter?
Nothing.
He thinks I'm somebody else.
Well, she's not.
Uh, look, could I please have four nice lamb chops?
I'm in an awful hurry.
Sure.
Lamb chops.
What are you gonna get for Duke?
They're for Duke.
Oh, he won't eat 'em.
He most certainly will.
I fix them in a very special way.
Excuse me.
I don't care how you fix 'em.
He's liable to throw 'em at ya.
Not me.
I'm not his better half... not yet.
Hey, what about it?
I'm hungry.
Uh, not yet!
You look pretty...
Right pretty.
I might as well tell ya, Duke.
- I don't approve of this whole thing.
- What whole thing?
You goin' over there for dinner and all.
Well, a man's gotta eat, don't he?
Not like this, he don't.
I tell ya, that little gal over there means business.
So do I.
Listen, Duke, you're a wild horse, and you ain't never been busted.
But that don't mean you ain't never gonna be.
- Oh, don't worry.
- Ohh, she ain't for you!
Remember what you told me?
Women is like socks...
Ya gotta change 'em regular.
This gal's different.
All ready!
This gal's different, and you're gonna find it out.
You sound like a wife.
Come in.
Would you like to sit here?
Why? Ain't supper ready?
Yes, but I thought we might have our cocktails here.
- Smells good. What do we got?
- You'll see.
Well, here's to ya.
- What is it?
- It's tomato juice.
It don't taste like it.
It's the way I prepare it, with lime juice.
It's good this way, isn't it?
Yeah, if you... like tomato juice.
Oh, are you hungry?
Well, to tell you the truth...
Yes.
Well, let's start then.
This is your place, here.
Hors d'oeuvres?
What's the matter?
Lamb chops.
Yes.
- I never eat lamb chops.
- But they're good.
Come on. Let's go downtown and get a steak.
Oh, try them.
But I don't like them.
I never ate them, that's why.
Why?
I don't like them.
I like steak.
Hey. They're all right.
You see?
They taste just like steak.
Sure.
Maybe we oughta eat outside...
More light out there.
What's so wonderful about light?
Nothin' 'cept...
I just bit my thumb.
Too bad we haven't got some beer.
Yes, isn't it?
You got everything.
Thank you.
Got any more meat?
No. No, but you can have one of mine. Here.
Now, eat your salad, Duke.
It's good for you.
I'll get the dessert.
Apple pie?
No.
Rice pudding?
No, something else.
- I don't like anything else.
- Why?
'Cause I never eat anything else, that's why.
Well, I hope you like this,
'cause it's a surprise.
What is it? Well, it's a kind of a surprise for me too.
I got it at the store. It's called
"sunset on the desert" special.
Made me think of you.
Of me?
Demitasse now or later?
Oh, it don't matter much.
It looks just wonderful, doesn't it? Mm.
Mmm, it's good.
Mmm.
It's good.
Duke?
Hmm?
You know, all we've been together, and...
All the fun we've had and everything, and... Mm-hmm?
There's about a million questions I'd like to ask you.
What's the matter?
Oh, my. Duke.
Here. Here, take some of this.
Maybe it'll loosen it.
Ooh!
Ooh. You all right?
Yeah.
Gee. Gee, I'm so sorry.
It's all right.
It's just that...
I wanted everything so fancy for you.
Hmm, uh, let's...
Let's get the dishes washed, and then...
Maybe we can talk, and...
Yeah.
This'll only take a minute.
Hurry up, slowpoke.
Duke, what's the matter?
Plenty. I'm drunk.
- What?
- I'm drunk.
I haven't had a drink all day, and I'm drunk.
- Well, gee whiz, I thought we...
- I know what you thought, but you thought wrong.
I guess you don't want any more than any other girl wants.
But you come to the wrong place.
I'm not built that way.
Built what way?
I'm not gonna get hooked, that's what way!
Maybe this sort of thing works where you come from, but it don't work around here!
- Well, I...
- Leave me alone!
Quit tryin' to hook me!
- I'm not trying to...
- I got my own way of livin', and I'm not gonna have anybody changin' it.
- I don't want...
- And don't start cryin'.
Who's crying?
Just let me say it.
If I wanted to get hooked...
I'd let you hook me.
I don't know of nobody that...
But I don't wanna get hooked!
Hey, look.
- Molly!
- Oh, hello.
- Gee.
- How are ya, kid?
Say, what goes on with you?
I simply missed the bus.
It can happen.
Oh, gosh, honey we were so worried. You've no idea.
Yeah, we even put through a long-distance call.
Yeah, I paid.
Well, I hope you're none the worse for wear, kid, like they say.
Just what do you mean by that, Mr.
Lambert?
Nothin'. My goodness, I never saw such touchy people.
Come on, Molly. Come on over here.
Come on.
Molly, you gonna tell me everything?
Well, there's nothing to tell.
Oh, sure. I bet you could talk all the way home.
Well, I'm not gonna. All aboard!
All right, folks.
Here we go. Plenty of things to do, plenty to see.
Still at it, isn't he?
You have no idea.
All right. Come on.
Recess is over.
Come along. Move along. In you... bought a little flower there, huh?
All right, folks.
Here we go. Everybody up.
You all right, Joe?
Let's take it away.
All good things must come to an end.
Yes, sir, that's right, so let's face it.
And until we meet again, folks, remember one thing...
♪ There's no place like home ♪
♪ There's no place like home ♪
♪ And though it's very humble ♪
♪ There's no place like home ♪♪
I must say, this is my favorite part of the whole trip.
Remember, Molly, if you ever get stuck for an extra female some nights,. you've got my number, haven't you?
Yes.
Well... good-bye now.
Bye.
Molly!
Gee.
Hello, Malcolm.
Oh, thank you.
That's sweet.
Gee.
Hello, baby.
Ohh, welcome home.
- Bob.
- Gee.
Come on.
My cab's parked outside.
I guess I was here first, Bob.
I said, my cab was parked outside.
- I don't care.
- Listen, fat boy.
Who do you think you're pushing?
You're gonna get worse than a push if you don't give me that bag.
Bob, everybody's looking.
Please.
- You touch me once more...
- Give me that bag!
I've never liked you, Bob.
You may as well know it.
Listen, maybe you can't understand English.
I said, my cab was double-parked outside.
I don't care if it is double-parked.
You shouldn't have brought it.
- Shouldn't have brought my cab?
- No! Your big, yellow taxicab.
Look, my cab isn't yellow, and when I toot, get out of the way!
Break it up!
Oh, hello, Bob.
"Hello, Bob"?
Just a minute!
Now, listen.
We're all going together,
- or else I shall go by myself.
- Well, I was here first!
What are you doing here?
I thought...
I know what you thought, but you thought wrong.
- Just a minute.
- Well...
I, uh...
I met him out west.
You-you better put me down, Duke.
I, uh...
I want to introduce you to my friends.
Uh, Mr. Hudkins, this is Mr. Stone.
- How do you do?
- Howdy.
- Mr. Hastings.
- Hello.
- And Mr. Starkey.
- How do you do?
Molly, who is this guy?
- Well, I just told you...
- Who are you?
Well, I...
I don't know.
Duke, what are you doing in New York?
I just came to take you back.
- Now?
- Pretty soon.
Tour number 49 leaving for Kansas City, Tulsa,
- Phoenix and Los Angeles.
- Now.
Just a minute, Buffalo Bill.
Bob, I wish you'd let me take care of my own...
Where do you think you are, on the prairie?
Why, no, I, uh...
Duke!
Have a nice trip.
Just a minute.
I'm not going anyplace.
What's the matter with you?
Are you crazy?
Haven't I anything to say about this?
I can tell you one thing...
I'm certainly not going to get on any old bus.
I just got off a bus.
As a matter of fact,
I don't even know... whether I should be speaking to you... after the things that you...
No, honest, Duke, I mean it.
If you want to sit down and talk things over for a few minutes, that's one thing, but I-
I'm not getting on any bus!
Now, look. If you...
You're certainly mistaken, Duke.
That's all I've got to say.
Hello, hello, hello, hello.
Folks, I'd like to have your attention for a minute.
You're gonna have mine for the next 14 days, so it isn't asking for too much, is it?
Even if I change my mind, even if I wanted to go back with you,
I couldn't. I'd lose my job.
That's all right.
I got a job for ya.
I divorced Waco.
I got an idea you don't like me.
Well, I'll grow on ya, brother.
Yes, sir, I'll grow on ya!
Howdy, partner.
Glad to see ya.
Hello.
We'll be leaving in about two minutes, folks.
So don't get impatient.
Just as anxious to get started as you are.
Yes, sir, in about five seconds, we'll be off with the smoothest, most comfortable ride you ever had.
Yes, sir.
Smoothest ride you ever had, and I'm the boy who's gonna tell you about it.
Okay, Major. Let her go.
Contact!
-- English --
Yes, sir, that's where the sun takes his shoes off,
puts his feet up on the high Sierras, and says, "Here's where I set down:"
When the lord finished this job,
he took a long look and quit creatin':
Said, "From now on,
I'd just be repeatin' myself: "
Gee, them trees is so big,
you can carve yourself a Presbyterian church out of any one of them:
Yeah, with enough wood left over for a synagogue and a Baptist mission:
The soil is so rich,
one night a padre left his spade standing up in the ground,
the next morning, there was growing from the handle, apricots!
Takes two men and a boy to see clear to the top of them hills:
A lady eagle once tried to fly over:
She got her tail caught and couldn't lay an egg for a week:
This place has got everything but population:
Sister, pack up your washboard:
That's mine.
Come on now, throw her out of here!
We don't want the likes of her with us.
Here's your belongings!
Keep going.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Get going.
Come on, Lil.
I'll give you a hand.
Get her out of here!
Let's get over to the stage. It's heading east in about ten minutes.
East?
That's where I came from!
We don't care where you came from or where you go, just get!
Come on, Lil.
Go on, keep going!
Who's the boss of this wagon train?
I am.
How about a lift to California?
Not a chance.
Ah, Mr. Trumbo, if there's room for all of us, there's room for one more of us.
If this girl wants to go to California, she can ride in my wagon, and welcome.
Then you'll be traveling with wickedness and mortal sin, mister.
I'm warning you, cards ain't the only thing she cheats at.
That's right.
I'm glad indeed to see that you good women are dead set against wickedness and mortal sin.
Now, if she was at all pretty, there'd be something to worry about, but she doesn't look pretty to me.
Fabian, I think I've got something to say about that, and I say she doesn't go.
She can pay her way, if that's what you're a-thinkin'.
That isn't what
I'm thinking.
Then what are you thinking?
For $1000 cash on delivery,
I've guaranteed to lay this outfit down in California, all of a piece.
There'll be troubles enough.
Who are you afraid of?
Me or yourself?
I don't care what kind of baggage we carry, only I don't want the boys fighting over it.
You say there's trouble ahead of us, Mr. Trumbo.
Now, these good women know it's help from divine providence we'll be needing there.
And by doing one good deed now, we'll have providence on our side.
We should give help where help is needed.
Isn't that what the good book says?
I'm with you, Mr. Fabian. A small investment in the almighty now is liable to pay off big later on, when we need it.
Then it's all settled and she comes with us, Mr. Trumbo.
It's your outfit, Fabian.
I just work here.
Hey you, missy. Don't get no ideas you're a-comin' 'cause we want you. We don't.
You're only comin' because
Mr. Fabian says so, see?
Come on, child.
My turn, Mr. Trumbo!
No, it's mine, isn't it?
Yeah, it's your turn with the saddle, Johnny.
Thanks, Mr. Trumbo.
Joe, you take care of his feed, huh? What about me?
It'll be your turn tomorrow night, and maybe I'll even let you ride him.
Thanks, Mr. Trumbo!
Bob.
Hey, Reb.
Yeah?
Better check this rim, or you'll be on three wheels.
Sure will, Johnny.
Why, hello, Elwyn. That's an awful lot of gun you've got there.
This is Indian country, isn't it?
Yeah, well don't plug me!
Aw, it isn't even loaded yet. Look.
Whoa! Pick yourself up.
Doggone your hide, Elwyn! Now you've been and woke the baby.
Aw, don't be too hard on him, Mrs.
Brown. We need a lot of men like him.
Oh, come on, get your gun.
You sent for us, Johnny?
Oh, yes, Abe.
You and Whitey better get around to your sections and warn 'em to go easy on the water.
The next two days is a long dry haul.
Right away, Johnny.
What do you think you're doing? That's water.
I thought it was molasses.
And where do you think we get it, whistle for it?
That's two days rations there, and you're washing your hair in it.
I ought to make you drink it.
How am I supposed to keep clean?
Stay dirty, like the rest of us.
How're your grapes, Grandpa?
Are your cuttings dry?
Yeah, dry, they're pitifully dry.
Mr. Trumbo, I heard you talking to Miss Lily.
Am I right in thinking you were a little harsh with her?
I'm harsh with everybody, I've got to be.
The soft ones don't make it to California.
Maybe you think it's easy hauling you farmers over the trail.
I'd rather ride herd on some buffalo.
Then why did you hire yourself out as a guide?
I often wondered that about you. You're not the type.
Maybe I like to keep moving.
You know
Missouri at all?
Yeah, I've been through it.
I had a vineyard there once.
It's good earth.
Great earth, fine earth.
If you like it so well, why'd you leave it?
Because I want the sun, the sun of
California. Not for meself, for me grapes.
They catch the sun and save it, and then they let loose the warmth in the heart of man when he drinks the wine they make.
Don't look much like grapes to me.
They look like a bunch of dead sticks.
From those dead sticks
I've seen many a miracle rise.
Every spring in my vineyard, I've seen them bursting out into glorious life, and I'll see it again, please God, in California.
You're not in California yet.
Well, with God's help and yours, we'll be there one day.
From these dead sticks there'll be thousands of acres of grape vines, covering the hills like a great green blessing.
Well, well. Slick and shiny as a new saddle.
Where are you going,
Pennock, to a dance?
At our present rate of travel,
I'd say nobody was going anywhere.
Look, for the past 17 days, we've been crawling across this empty desolation.
How much longer is it going to take?
Well, I figure it's now about
7:00. With good luck, no bad storms, no Indian attacks, no sick folks or sick stock, well, I should think we'd be in California before snow flies.
I'm serious.
So am I.
We're all in a hurry to get where we're going.
Mr. Pennock as well as the rest of us.
Though perhaps his reasons are different.
You don't look like a farming man, Mr. Pennock.
Sometimes I wonder why you're here at all.
I'm here on business.
Business? Well, that covers a lot of ground.
I suppose there'll be more of your kind following the farmers to California.
It'll be the next state in the Union, God willing.
In these dangerous times,
Mr. Fabian,
I wouldn't be so sure there'll be a Union left for California to join.
We don't need that kind of talk,
Mr. Pennock. Not on this train.
Only a fool would say these are not dangerous times.
A little grease on your tongue, Pennock.
Keep out of this, mule skinner.
What do you know about politics?
Why, nothing, Pennock.
Nothing at all.
We've got people with this outfit from
Ohio and Kentucky, Wisconsin and Georgia, and from states both North and South.
And they're getting along fine, understand?
So if you have any more of that talk in you, you'd better say it to yourself.
When we get to California, you can all tear your hearts out, for all I care.
Me, I'll be having a long drink.
But until then, I'm telling you, keep your mouth shut and your nose clean.
Oh, I should have stood in Massachusetts
Massachusetts, Massachusetts
M, A, Massachusetts
Roll along and roll along and roll and go
Oh, away out West
Away out West
Beyond the great unknowns
The buzzards crave my liver
The coyotes are out for my bones
If it hadn't been for the bloomin' law
and a wench with a delicate ear
I wouldn't have had to leave the States
to be a pioneer:::
Huh!
You better take care of your eyes.
You'll go blind trying to read in that light.
Aw, no.
You want to listen to this for a bit and forget about those women out there?
"A land of wheat and barley and vineyards,
"wherein fig trees and pomegranates and olive yards grow.
"A land of oil and honey,
"where without any want, thou shall eat thy bread and enjoy abundance of all things. "
Somebody else going to California?
No, this was thousands of years ago.
They were the children of Israel, and God was leading them over the
River Jordan to the Promised Land.
They're mighty pretty words.
Pretty words, pretty names.
I know lots of names.
Natchez, Memphis, Savannah, Biloxi,
New Orleans. They're pretty names.
But they're places that can break your heart, too.
None of them had room for Lily Bishop.
California will have room for you.
I'll find a place somewhere.
And nobody can throw me out.
Nobody.
I'm grateful to you for taking me along to the Promised Land.
What did you call it?
The book calls it Canaan, but we call it California.
Now mind what I say, don't let them hurt you.
Now go to sleep, child, go to sleep.
Yeah, sure.
They didn't hurt.
They can't.
Goodnight.
Goodnight, child.
Whoa!
It's good to see the soldiers out here. Sure is.
Lily, Abe baked some cornbread last night,
I'll bet they'd sure like some of it.
I'll ask 'em.
Howdy.
Hey.
Where's your guide?
He went ahead to scout around a bit.
Trumbo back yet? Ain't seen him, Michael.
Well, maybe you can tell me.
How's the water hole at Salt Lick?
A horse could be up to his knees in it when we left, it was that deep.
Good. Trumbo you say his name was? Trumbo.
That's an unusual name. He wouldn't have a brother, would he?
Never spoke to me of any brother.
I knew a lieutenant by that name once.
Campaigned with him. Good soldier, too.
Not the kind you'd expect to become a deserter. Well, keep to the trail.
Still taking nourishment, huh?
There's no hardship can kill the life that's in them.
I feel I ought to take off me hat to these little dead sticks, as you once called them.
Yeah, they still look like it to me.
Johnny, we never mentioned such things, but have you any brothers at all?
No.
And if it isn't too nosy on my part, were you ever in the army?
What makes you ask that?
Just an old man maundering about the things that are none of his business.
Look, you hired me to take you to California, didn't you?
I did.
I'll take you there.
But if you've got any questions to ask, you should've asked them before you hired me.
No questions, Johnny.
No questions.
Good.
Should have stood in Michigan.
Me, too.
I pass.
See you, Lil.
Three jacks.
That wins.
Fellas, I'm blue.
Still got your pants, haven't you?
Yes, but I'd hate to go home to the missus without 'em.
Want to take his place, Trumbo?
Not me.
Saving your money, huh?
Johnny ain't saving his money, he ain't got it yet.
Come on, Johnny.
Maybe you can break her luck.
Maybe he can, maybe he can't.
Perhaps Mr. Trumbo prefers some simpler pastime.
You can tame her, Johnny.
What'll it be this time, boys?
Half a dollar too steep?
Abe, looks like it might get excitin'.
Too excitin' for me, Pokey.
Pass blind.
I'll bet a dollar.
I pass.
Got a dollar, Trumbo?
Raise it a dollar.
I'll play out.
Pass.
Well, it's just you and me.
Your dollar and three more.
That's enough for me.
You're expensive company, Lil.
Too hot for me.
Still want to climb those golden stairs, Trumbo?
Looks like he's fallin' down 'em!
I'll raise you five.
I'll call you.
Straight.
Full house.
That does it.
They're not marked, if that's what you're thinking. But look at them anyway.
A little something you learned at your mother's knee, huh?
No, my father's.
He was a gambler, played the Mississippi riverboats.
He always used to say, "It's your cheat who's most afraid of being cheated. "
Better stay on your horse after this, Trumbo.
It makes you look a lot more important than you really are.
Another thing my father told me.
Always leave a man burying money. Here.
What do you want?
Came to give you back your burying money.
I need any favors from you,
I'll ask for them.
Aren't you afraid that people will see you? Come in.
Sit down.
Took you a long time to make up your mind, didn't it?
What do you mean, make up my mind?
Why don't you admit that back in Pawnee Flat there was something else you were afraid of?
You know, for a woman, you're pretty smart.
I am smart. Too smart.
I know too much. A woman gets tired knowing too much.
Sometimes she likes to be surprised.
Like this, maybe?
That was what you wanted, wasn't it?
Well, that's exactly what you're not going to get.
Oh, so now you're paying me off, huh?
You sat like judgment on your horse.
What did you think when I was on my hands in the dust?
I can tell you what you thought. I know what you thought.
You didn't wait for any proof.
No, no, you knew. You knew just by looking at me.
But you're not a hard man to figure.
All these weeks when you were trying to shame me, trying to break my heart, that was your way of making love to me.
Then you come in here and expect me to fall in your arms and be thankful for the favor you're doing me.
You may think you're pretty high and mighty, Trumbo, but let me tell you this.
If I live long enough, and I will,
I'm going to pull you down off that fancy horse of yours and shove your face in the muck.
So help me.
Trumbo, Trumbo!
Trumbo!
Where is Trumbo?
Trumbo?
You better go, Trumbo.
Trumbo!
Trumbo!
Here he comes now.
What's all the hollering about?
They've struck it rich in California. Gold!
These men just brought the news.
Gold!
That's right, gold.
Where? Somewhere's out of Sacramento.
Place called Sutter's Mill.
They're always finding gold in
California, but nobody ever saw it.
Well, it's straight this time.
Well, we're headed for California. If you like, you can string along with us.
No thanks, mister.
We'll take a bed for the night and something to eat, and thank you for it.
But we ain't waitin' for no wagon wheels.
We aim to get to California while there's still standing room.
As you like.
I'll lend you a blanket, partner.
Just tell me some more about that gold.
Gold in California.
Oh, Johnny, that's news
I don't like to hear.
But it's big news,
Grandpa.
Gold, I hate the word.
It'll bring us nothing but murder and greed.
They steal it out of the ground, they steal it from one another.
It's a curse on us that those men brought us the news.
Look what it's done already. Look at their faces, look at their eyes.
This is your big chance, Paddy, but it won't do you no good
if everybody gets there before you:
The whole world is gonna be knowin' about this soon:
That's too many people to suit me:
Jessie, use your brains and stay with the train!
Get away from here, Trumbo.
All right, have it your way!
Better another month on the trail than leave that here, Slim.
You'll need that plow.
I'll buy me a new one in
California. Gold plated, too.
You leaving Fabian's wagon?
I am. Nobody's going to get to California ahead of me.
Lil, I suppose you've got plenty of reasons to hate me, but I don't want to see anything happen to you.
And this wagon train breaking up, it's liable to be dangerous.
I'll take my chances.
Before you go, there's something I'd like to say.
About last night, I mean, I...
Speak up, Trumbo. I might begin to think you're not sure of yourself.
Well, about hitting you,
I'm sorry.
I'm trying to apologize.
We're ready to go, Lil.
Is that all you've got?
You going with him?
Yeah, is there anything to say about it?
No.
Except I almost made a mistake.
Whoa! Whoa!
Just a minute, Pennock...
Ah, the murdering gold. Look around you, look at all they've thrown away.
Plows, books, furniture of all kinds.
Stoves, spinning wheels, and all the tools they need to build a home. Huh.
Galloping after gold, they are. What good is it?
Ah, the lasting thing is planting the ground, making things grow generation after generation. That's lasting, and there's contentment in it.
Easy, rest easy, now. It's that little bone in there, I think.
It'll not be better tomorrow or the day after. That'll take time to mend.
Seven hundred miles of God's empty wilderness between us and California, and this had to happen.
I'm sorry, Gramps, looks like
I'll be holding you back.
I'm in no hurry.
The earth and the sun and the soil will still be there when we get there, Johnny.
Yeah, but not the gold,
Grandpa, not the gold.
And what about my $1000? Who's going to pay that? What am I gonna do?
You take it easy till we're ready to hit the trail again.
I'm in charge now, and those are my orders.
Well, Johnny, we're on our way. Hup, hup!
Whoa.
Now, Johnny, you can get a bath and a drink. I'll look after your horse.
I'll help you unhitch, Grandpa, and you better come with me.
No, no, there's a little friend here I have to consult.
Thought you didn't like liquor.
This isn't liquor, this is brandy.
Made from the grapes themselves. Here, try it.
The golden elixir, the life for all men.
Life?
That's a mortal enemy.
I forgot you were only a growing boy.
Johnny, if you come back and find me talking, I'll be talking to meself.
Just put me to bed peacefully.
Go on and enjoy yourself.
Go on!
So, you made it, Trumbo.
Where's Lily?
Haven't you seen her?
No.
You will, Trumbo.
You will.
I'm asking you, where is she?
You can't get her off your mind, can you?
There's a lot of things
I can't get off my mind, but I'm taking 'em one at a time.
You know, Trumbo, if ever you grow up, you'll learn that a woman is like a poker game.
What you take in one hand, you drop in the next.
You were never in this game.
I thought I was, for a while, but I lost to a heavier bid.
What do you mean by that?
If you want a drink, you better order it now.
Our entertainer doesn't like drinks served while she's singing.
Whiskey.
Whiskey.
Same for me.
Who runs the cleanest gambling house?
Too-rye, too-rye, fa-da-linka-dye-do

Too-rye, too-rye, fa-da-linka-dye-do
A respectable girl, she marries soon:
Ugh!
A respectable girl, she marries soon
But the groom comes here for his honeymoon
Lily-I, Lily-I-Oh, oh, oh, Lily-I, Lily-I-Oh
Wonderful, Lily.
Wonderful as usual.
Singin' pretty, ain't she?
That she is.
Sit down, Pike.
Mr. Pike, Mr. Trumbo.
Howdy.
Sailor, huh?
Ain't no stinkin' scurvy landlubber.
Pike, one of these days, someone's just naturally going to spit in your eye.
Doggone my britches,
Johnny Trumbo!
Whitey! So you made it, huh?
Yeah, but a lot of 'em didn't.
You strike it rich yet?
Strike it rich?
Ask that thievin' gouger. He can tell you better than me.
Go ahead and ask them, Johnny.
Him and his Captain Coffin!
Watch your lip, farmer.
Not no more, I won't.
Likely, I'll get my teeth bashed in, but not afore I spoke my piece.
Come on, Whitey.
I ain't makin' out good at all, Johnny.
I come out west expecting to find a free country, and instead I find a shark named Coffin, squeezin' the lifeblood out of the place.
To work my claim,
I gotta buy water from Coffin.
I thought water belonged to God almighty, but no, you gotta pay for every drop.
I gotta buy Coffin's vittles at Coffin's prices. I gotta buy my tools off him.
$100 for one little shovel.
Shut up.
Because I got a wife and kids back east, I do all this.
I go into debt up to my ears to Coffin, let him take the shirt off of my back!
Shut up.
He's talking to me.
Day before yesterday, my claim starts to pay out. Pay out good.
Right then, Coffin and his gang jumps it, says they're foreclosing for debt.
Drive me off of the place with pick handles!
You!
What's the damage this time?
Just a chair and a table.
Sorry, Miss Lily. I'm beginning to think you're too expensive to have around.
It takes a long time to get furniture out here.
Lily, an old acquaintance, slightly in need of repair.
Shall I throw him out?
No. Bring him back here.
I'm glad to see you're still living.
Well, I suppose I should thank you for taking care of me.
I told you once before how I felt about you.
Nothing's happened to make any difference.
Or have you forgotten?
No, I haven't forgotten, Lil.
But I'm just beginning to understand something.
No woman can go around hating a man the way you say you hate me.
Not unless there's something else on her mind.
Babble on, Mr. Trumbo.
But this I'll tell you.
If you ever so much as set foot in here again,
I'll have a better man than Pike throw you out.
You talk awful big, like maybe you own the place.
I do.
Maybe I shouldn't ask how you got it.
How do you think I got it?
What I'm thinkin' you wouldn't like.
Yeah, nothing too good for our Lil. Straight out of China.
He must be quite a man to stake you to a layout like this.
Ah, a brig.
Nice shear.
For a mule skinner, you seem to know a lot about ships.
My father was first mate on a whaler. Yeah, she's pretty.
Congo Queen,
Pharaoh Coffin, Master.
Coffin, now there's a name I keep hearing. Whitey, he said it.
Pharaoh Coffin. There's an echo in my mind some place.
Congo Queen?
I've got it!
Sure, she's pretty, pretty as a picture. Fast, too. She had to be.
Now I understand everything.
Something amuse you, friend?
No, don't tell me.
I've never laid eyes on you before, nor you on me.
But I'll bet you a dollar to one of your brass buttons that you're Coffin.
Captain Pharaoh Coffin.
And I lay a dollar to what's left of your manners that you're Mr. Jonathan Trumbo.
Ah, Pike told you.
No, Pennock.
Well, you're a long ways from
Africa, Captain, and the slave trade.
Only fools stayed in the African trade.
Why should I crowd my ship with live cargo when I can get more for a shovel than I can for a Black?
Or by running helpless little men off their claims with pick handles.
These are fast-moving times, friend.
Helpless little men have no place in them.
This is an odd place, though, to find a man who remembers the old Congo Queen.
Fine ship. Fine name.
I remember her. Not for her name, though, but for the blood on her decks and the smell of the slaves rotting in the hold.
She was a floating graveyard, and when you walked along the streets, people crossed to the other side.
They said you had the stink of death about you.
Well, you might have washed it out of your clothes, but it'll take more than soap and water to wash it out of your mind.
Your tongue's outrunning your safety, friend.
No court would try you, Captain, because no one would hold that a Black was a man.
He was an animal, which you beat and chained, and all he had to offer up against you was a prayer.
Bilge, Mr. Trumbo. Bilge.
Most men love the chains they wear.
They need a master the way they need their mothers.
I've heard such talk from pulpits.
"The meek shall inherit the earth. "
No, Mr. Trumbo. The earth belongs to the men who make the law.
And the law belongs to the men who can lay it down.
You know, Coffin, for all your ways, I've heard it said that you're a scared man.
Scared that one day a bolt would break or a chain would give, and the Blacks would come swarming up over your quarterdeck.
They said you kept the keys to the hatches in your pocket.
But have you kept the key to hold over your mind?
What do you dream about at night, Captain?
Maybe you still hear the drag of the chains below decks, the chanting of the slaves over their dead.
That's the truth of it, isn't it, Captain?
In Pharaoh City, the truth has a price on its head.
You don't speak it unless you're armed, nor intrude into another man's dreams unless you're prepared to pay for the intrusion.
Save your advice for those who'll take it at the end of pick handles!
And I had you wrong, Lily. You don't care about anybody but Lily Bishop.
I had you right the first time
I saw you up in Pawnee Flat, when you were lying in the dirt and I took you for what they said you were.
Who said the wages of sin are death?
Looks like in Pharaoh City they come pretty high.
Why did you do that?
Better leave, Mr. Trumbo.
Why did you do it?
Why did you do it?
Because I knew you'd cry over him afterwards.
Looks like she's petering out, Whitey.
Yeah. Maybe if we staked a new claim.
All we've got here is Coffin's leavings.
There must be easier ways of making a living without dying of pneumonia.
What's that?
Somebody fellin' a tree.
Coffin's at it again, damming up the creek!
You got no right to dam up this creek.
Now, ain't no use gettin' ornery, boys.
Water is water, and mighty precious it is, too.
And this here stream, above, below, and in the middle happens to be the sole and peculiar property of Captain Coffin.
Now, it ain't the Captain's practice to give water away.
But like always, he's willing to share it with them that is willing to pay.
Now, I ask you, what could be fairer than that?
I thought this was
God's country.
Not no more, it ain't.
What's Coffin aimin' to do, grab up the whole country of California?
Maybe you're righter than you know, brother.
You let 'em get by with this, in a month you'll be crawling to Coffin for a handout.
That's just what I was thinking. Look out, boys!
Not now, Johnny. Better let 'em take this trick.
All right, who's next?
Come on, Johnny.
Let's get out of here.
That's right, come on.
Keep it in a safe place, partner.
I'll be around to buy it back.
Well, Clem, I see your claim's paying off.
Right off the river bottom.
Fourteen ounces.
Eleven ounces.
The game is open, place your bets.
What's the limit?
Five is soda.
Copper that ten, will you?
Just a minute. I thought I told you to stay out of here.
This is business. I don't want any business from you.
What's the matter, you scared?
What have you got that
I should be scared of?
Wouldn't be my luck, would it?
Get up, Mike. I'll take it.
All right, boys.
Place your bets.
This time, Trumbo, there won't be any burying money.
You win again.
Let it ride.
The limit.
The limit's raised.
What has she got left?
Four stacks.
All right, four stacks it is.
On the lady.
That all right with you?
Anything you say.
Four, three, ten.
Queen wins.
That's luck for you!
Pay him off, Mike.
The game's closed.
You busted, Lil?
Looks like it.
Just a minute, Lil. I got an idea, a sporting proposition.
I'll cut you.
This against the whole place.
Everything or nothing, high card wins. What do you say?
Better not do it, Lil.
He's lucky tonight.
Once you said you weren't afraid of anything I've got.
Well, I've got this, and it says you've lost your nerve.
Pack of cards, Mike.
Shuffle them.
Always want to check them, don't you?
Always.
You cut.
Four of diamonds.
You got a chance, Lil.
Go ahead.
Two of spades.
Well, looks like I'm the new proprietor.
Eddie, turn everything over to him. It's all in order, isn't it?
Yes, Miss Lily, except for tonight.
Some sharper slipped this over on us.
Dirt and lead instead of gold.
Well, that's a fool trick for anyone to do.
Yes.
A man can get shot for that.
Not if he gets away with it, Lil.
Well, drinks on the house, everybody!
Come on, Clem!
Mr. Trumbo, this is Mr. Gunce.
Says he can paint.
Yeah, what does he paint?
Names on shaving mugs.
In a town full of beards?
Mugs is only a sideline.
I'm the undertaker.
Well, could you paint a sign for out front?
Yep. Plain or fancy?
Just big.
"The Admission Day Saloon. "
Admission Day? Me paint a thing like that? I don't know, Mr. Trumbo.
California joining the Union's getting to be fighting words around here.
Some mighty important people against it.
I'm a business man, I got my customers to consider.
Why should you worry?
They're all dead, aren't they?
Hmm. Yeah, I never thought of that.
You know, I never looked at it that way.
Come on, Gunce, I'll show you what the boss wants.
Mr. Trumbo.
What's this?
A quit claim deed.
Eddie will show you the books.
You don't have to leave.
You can work here, you know.
Don't do me any favors.
I'm not.
I need a singer.
Maybe you can get a big piece of Coffin's money back.
It wasn't Coffin's money.
Then, whose was it?
Mine.
I bought this place from Coffin with what it took me five years to save.
But that's my business, not yours.
All right, Lil, if that's the way you feel.
That's exactly the way I feel.
Mike, wrap up a thousand, chase after Lil, and see that she gets it.
Burying money.
Won't need no burying money where she's going.
Why not?
Coffin's place.
Hey, you.
Captain's compliments. If you ain't too busy with these here newly acquired premises,
he'd take it kindly if you'd step down to the hacienda:
He'd like to have a bit of a word with you.
He would, would he?
Want a drink?
Make it rum.
On the house, Pike.
Why would you be giving me a drink?
You got a nice, kind face.
You had a jug in your hand. Why didn't you smack me over the head with it?
You ever hear of bullfrogs in a pond?
Well, some sing big, some sing small. You, I can't even hear you.
Go on, run along to your
Captain. Tell him I'll be there.
Come in, Trumbo. Come in.
The Captain's ready to see you.
Oh, of course, you two know each other.
Let that bird alone, Pennock.
Let him alone.
Pleasure to see you're prompt,
Mr. Trumbo.
For fun or for fight, I always like to get there early.
Which do you expect this time?
You tell me.
When I invited you here, I must admit,
I didn't expect you'd do me the honor.
I appreciate it.
It's just curiosity, Captain.
I'd heard about this place, but I never would've believed it.
I hear you took over the Golden Lily last night.
I like a man who takes what he wants, doesn't ask too many questions.
I like to see him get ahead.
Yeah, but not too far ahead, huh?
I have a good piece of this country in my hands.
You'd be very foolish to think that I'd let it go.
What's on your mind, Coffin?
I'll put it two ways, friend.
I'll buy the Golden Lily at a fair price, and you can leave town.
Or you can stay here and go along with me. Know what that means?
I'm doing all right alone.
Saloon keeper?
Any fool can line his pockets with silver dollars.
Lift your eyes above your whiskey bottles.
I could possess this country, this California and all the power that goes with it, if I had a handful of men like you.
No deal. You may not know it, Mr. Trumbo, but you've just made a very dangerous decision.
You may not know it, Captain, but from this minute on, I'm going to start crowding you.
I'm going to keep on crowding you till
I've pushed you right into the Pacific.
Keep on playing, Lily.
Keep on playing.
Blast you, Pennock, leave that bird alone!
What was that?
The clock, Captain.
Just the clock.
I never found another island like that in all the southern seas.
Such tranquility, such a paradise.
Yes, a man could well forget himself there.
Why didn't you stay?
That horizon's too narrow for me.
Elvira!
No, the only reason I'd ever go there again would be to take you with me.
Did you hear what I said, Lily?
I'd like to take you there someday.
I've been everywhere else, why not?
No, no.
I mean as my wife.
You really mean that, don't you?
Ever since I first saw you.
Does that seem strange to you?
All my life, I've wanted to be just that.
A wife.
Does that seem strange to you?
No. I have no illusions that you love me.
I believe we can be happy together.
Let's put the past behind us.
I know what they say about me, slaver, all the rest of it.
Everything I did, I did because
I had to. Nobody ever helped me.
Son of a drunken sail-rigger.
I took more beatings before I was
12 than any felon does in a lifetime.
Ran away, slept under walls like a rat, till one day
I saw a Captain step from his ship to the shore.
Bright buttons gleaming in the sun.
Giving orders like a giant, like a king.
And I became the master of a ship.
Now I'm master of a town, dirty, stinking place that it is.
And tomorrow I'll be master of a country, yes, even all California.
When that happens,
I want you...
Well, you're not even listening to what I'm saying.
You've other thoughts in your eyes. You...
You're thinking of somebody else.
Yes, I am.
Who?
A little boy.
I was trying to picture you like you said.
I'm beginning to understand you.
Lily...
Goodnight Mike.
Goodnight, Mr. Trumbo.
All right, Trumbo, don't bother to put those away.
This is your last night in
Pharaoh City. Come over here.
You heard what the Captain said.
Here's a quit claim deed for the Golden Lily.
There's a pen. Sign it.
Stop it, get away.
It's regrettable that a man has to be taught these lessons, but sometimes it's necessary.
He's tied good and fast, Captain.
Hammerin', hammerin'. Sure a lot of buildin' going on around here.
Church, new houses, a school. I tell you, Whitey, it's getting so civilized they'll soon tell you where to spit.
Yes, sir, Pokey, never thought I'd see a church being put up in Pharaoh City.
Here comes the stage.
Warren, you see that everything gets off all right. I'll find out where we go.
Howdy, Joe.
Howdy.
You there, we're looking for
Captain Coffin's hacienda:
Mister, you're the seventeenth party to ask me that today.
What's going on there, a barbecue or something?
Come, come, man, pull yourself together. Where is it?
Well, if you point that there belly of yours south-by-southeast and keeps a-followin' it and don't fall down no gopher holes,
I reckon you'll get there. Mighty fancy looking man, ain't he, Whitey?
Always thought there was nothing but grizzlies and Indians out here, but I swear I've never seen so many beautiful women. Where do they all come from?
This is a big country, Creel. It's taken some of them days to get here.
Captain, I haven't seen
Tomlin yet.
I'm informed that Mr. Tomlin met with an unfortunate accident on his way from Santa Barbara. Bandits?
No Senator, he talked too loud and too long.
Excuse me.
Don Luis.
Señor Coffin.
I'd like a word with you, at your convenience, of course.
At the conclusion of this dance, sir.
Thank you.
Music won't help you now, me boy.
Johnny. Johnny, come in! It's good to see you.
How are you, Grandpa? Bring him some coffee. Sit down.
We were wondering what happened to you.
It wasn't like you to sell out and run off without tellin' nobody.
I didn't sell out,
I was run out.
Captain Coffin. Did a pretty good job, too. Almost perfect.
You've been gone six weeks now.
Well, I wasn't in the best of health when I left here.
If it hadn't been for a couple of Mexicans, I'd have cashed in.
They packed me 100 miles to a mission,
hoping the padres could cheat the devil.
Well, they did.
Whitey, where's your gun?
What do you want it for?
Don't do it,
Johnny.
It'll do you no good to kill Coffin.
Men like Coffin are like weeds in the fields, you have to dig 'em up by the roots. Can't do that with a gun.
There'll be law and order around here soon.
There's talk already of a convention in Monterey to make California another state in the Union.
When that happens, the law will take care of men like Coffin.
Sorry, Grandpa.
I can't wait that long.
This proclamation, gentlemen,
I'm sure you've all seen.
It's been posted all over California.
General Riley, Washington's latest gift to California, has designated September 1st for a convention to be held at Colton Hall, Monterey.
In the hands of the delegates of this convention will rest the decision as to whether or not
California is to become a state.
As you all know, I intend to be a delegate myself.
Even so, the convention may go against us, and it is to consider this possibility that we're meeting here tonight.
What is Señor Coffin proposing?
Immediate preparation for the armed seizure of the centers of power in California.
Isn't that rushing things a little too fast, Captain?
Too fast, Mr. Barrett? Nothing can be further from the fact.
The whole country is rushing toward armed conflict.
And when that time comes, my friends, a strong and independent California may effect decisively the outcome of that conflict.
Sir, I, too, would like
California to be a great and glorious independent country.
And yet, if the people should be against it, I...
I would be a fool to fight them.
Much blood has already been spilled on this beautiful ground. Too much.
The Senator, it seems, is asking a great deal of us. What can we expect from him?
Yes, if we are going to take the country by force, what do we do about weapons?
Powder and shot don't grow on trees.
No, Mr. Willoughby, they do not.
Before we adjourn tonight, I think
I can promise you ample evidence of Senator Creel's good faith.
Who are you?
Well, I suppose you could call me a guest.
Please do not tell the Captain.
Tell him what?
I am not supposed to be here.
He keeps the chapel locked.
Why?
That must be him now!
Follow me, gentlemen.
Perhaps you'll find these precincts overly pious, but I assure you, they're practical.
Well, there you are, gentlemen.
Guns and ammunition galore.
Fancy place for an armory, Coffin.
Even Mr. Willoughby could hardly wish for more.
Good heavens, no.
Enough to equip a regiment.
And we ran 'em in, every one of them, didn't we, Pennock?
Right under
Colonel Stuart's nose.
Stuart?
Is he back in California?
He's encamped not far from here.
You don't suppose he's got wind of this?
If I know Stuart, he's too busy with his own political career.
These are really very good guns. Indeed, they are.
Seems to me, Coffin, you've got all your eggs in one basket.
Why not pass them around, get them out of here? We will, in due time.
Come on, gentlemen. I think we've had enough proof of Senator Creel's good faith.
Why does he have these guns here?
I do not know, señor, but no good can come of it.
What do you think he is thinking that his house should be made into a hiding place for rifles?
I take it you don't like
Coffin, either. Why?
Is it right that a woman should have to steal a key to pray?
No, it isn't right.
And maybe that's all going to be changed.
Be careful, señor:
You are only one man against many.
You just forget you ever saw me.
Look away, look away
Said I to my heart, said I
Never trust yourself with a summer sky
A rambling arm, a roving eye
Every summer kiss brings an autumn sigh
Said I to my heart, said I
Look away, there's trouble
A stranger has come to town
Look away, big trouble
His eyes are too soft
and brown, brown, brown
Oh, does he think to win you with song and sigh?
With rambling arm, and roving eye?
Does he think you'll smile
and away you'll fly?
Said I to my heart,
Said I
Goodbye, said my heart
Goodbye
What are you doing here?
Thought I'd like to see one of Coffin's fiestas:
You know this isn't a safe place for you.
Since when have you cared?
I don't.
Then why warn me?
I haven't changed.
Why should you?
Perhaps it's because
I'm not afraid anymore.
Of you, of anything.
Perhaps it's because for the first time in my life
I've got something
I've always wanted.
What would that be?
I'm going to marry
Pharaoh Coffin.
You don't love him.
He knows it.
You wouldn't understand, would you?
That a woman can sometimes manage without love.
Providing the price is all right.
A month ago I would have hated you for that.
Now it doesn't matter.
I could even tell you
I could have liked you.
The way you were with the kids on the trail, the way you are with Fabian.
You talk hard, but underneath you're human like everybody else.
Why didn't you ever show that side to me instead of always trying to hurt me?
Why do you tell me now?
Because it's too late.
Too late, Trumbo.
Lily...
Please go.
You were right about me trying to hurt you.
I wanted to, I guess.
Don't ask my why.
Maybe I wanted to even up with a lot of other women.
Please go before you're seen.
And I'm gonna hurt you again, worse than ever.
And I'm gonna be sorry for it.
You can't hurt me.
That's one thing
I've promised myself.
You can't hurt me ever again.
I came here tonight to kill Pharaoh Coffin, but I'm not going to, not tonight.
I found out enough about your Captain to make me want to find out a little more.
But I'll come back, Lil, and when I do, nothing's gonna save him.
No, you mustn't.
Even if I loved you, you couldn't stop me now.
Afterwards, you can go on hating me again.
Lily, it's you.
I'm glad you came.
My guests kept me so busy.
But I missed you.
I need you.
You must never leave me for so long again.
I won't leave you, Pharaoh.
What's the matter?
You seem unhappy.
No, I'm not.
But just now, when you were dancing, your eyes were smiling.
But now...
They will be again.
In all my life, I never want to cause you a moment's sadness.
If only I could...
What was that?
Only the wind stirring the branches, Pharaoh.
Just the wind.
You know, for a moment it sounded just like naked feet shuffling across the deck.
Well, who are you?
What do you want?
Could I speak to you alone, sir? No, you may not.
Speak your piece and get out.
Oh, it's you.
Captain Odlum, Sergeant, close the door.
All right, Trumbo.
I don't know what brought you here, but you know how the army treats desertion.
I know, sir.
Consider yourself under close arrest.
I didn't wake you up in the middle of the night to put myself in the guardhouse.
What else do you expect?
I'd like to make a deal.
A deal? You've got nothing to trade.
Ever hear of
Captain Pharaoh Coffin?
The man who is running for the Monterey convention?
That's not all he's running for.
What if I said he's setting himself up for taking over the whole of California?
I'd say either he was crazy or you were.
Not if you saw the rifles he's been running in, enough to start a small war.
Can't hang a man for having a few rifles.
Is that all the evidence you got?
That, and some rumors and a hunch.
If I wrote down every rumor a fella gets around here,
I'd need half the United States Army.
You make a deal with me and you won't need the United States Army.
Confound it, Trumbo! The United States
Army doesn't make deals with deserters.
You come in here with some cock-and-bull story...
I beg your pardon, sir, it's not a cock-and-bull story.
No?
You help me wipe out my court martial, and I'll take Coffin off your hands.
How? Kill him?
Something like that.
That way of settling disputes is over, Trumbo.
This is the day of potbellies, frock coats, politicians, conventions.
If you want to kill this man, kill him politically.
Run somebody against him and break his back at the polls.
Now, do you know anybody that's really respected?
Integrity? Honesty?
Yes, I know somebody like that.
Michael Fabian, a farmer.
But what if it doesn't break
Coffin's back?
Tell you what I'll do, Trumbo.
I'll take responsibility for you myself.
I'll give you your freedom for 90 days.
That's till after the Monterey convention.
Then you report back here and you face court martial.
If you don't, you won't get two years, you'll get 20.
Yes, sir.
Uh, Trumbo, one thing always interested me.
That woman at
Fort Marcy, just who was chasing who?
It's your guess, sir.
Hardly worth deserting for.
It's either that or shoot the husband.
Anything else, sir?
You have 90 days.
Thank you, sir.
Do you think he's gonna do it?
He's got to.
Well, Michael, what's the word?
By the way, whose idea was this?
Mine.
Oh, it was, huh?
If we let Coffin get to Monterey without putting up a man to run against him, we deserve everything he hands us.
You've been yelling for a school, you even got 'em building a courthouse.
What are you going to do, let Coffin sit in it?
I don't know, boys.
I'm not one for being a politician.
I'm just an ordinary man with dirt on me hands.
Well, maybe it's about time some ordinary folks took a hold around here.
And what about me vines?
I've got things growing here.
Who'll take care of them? They need care. Who will give it to them?
Don't worry about your grapes, Michael.
They'll be worked.
Well, boys, you've run me clean out of argument.
I can see meself making speeches.
But I tell you, I'm not going round kissing any babies.
Don't worry about kissing no babies.
You just stand for office.
We'll see that you get elected.
Well?
You lost, Captain.
- How bad?
You're scuppered, sunk.
Thanks to your friend,
Trumbo.
So Fabian goes to Monterey.
That's bad for you, isn't it, Pharaoh?
Troublesome, perhaps.
Even more so for Mr. Fabian.
Why don't you continue playing, Lily?
P- E-N-sylvania
Roll on and roll on and roll and go:
Hurray!
Fabian for Monterey!
We better let him get some sleep or he'll never get to Monterey.
Good night, fellas.
Thanks for everything.
Congratulations again!
Good night! So long!
Get some sleep.
Michael.
Lily, what are you doing here?
I'm asking you not to go to Monterey. Why not?
I'm afraid for you.
Don't you see? This whole thing is Trumbo's idea.
He's using you to pay off a grudge.
What are you talking about?
You don't know how to fight the way they fight.
There's no telling what might happen when the cards are down.
The cards are down.
I know.
That's why I'm asking you not to go.
A man can't keep out of danger by hiding under the bed.
Sit down, child.
This is a big new country, and the people came here to get gold, most of them.
But now they've started farming and raising families, and you can no more keep them from making California a state than you can keep the sun from shining.
Because they're ordinary folk, and ordinary folk are kind of stubborn about important questions.
Don't be afraid for me.
I wish you wouldn't go, Michael.
I've been elected to go to
Monterey, and to Monterey I'll go.
Well, Michael, you sure got
Coffin a-sweating.
We're not out of the woods yet.
We'll see tomorrow.
Yeah, your speech will have to be a powerful heap of words.
Here you are.
Thanks, Abe.
Johnny.
See you later, Creel.
Sorry to be so late.
Things going badly,
Pharaoh?
I'll know better after tomorrow.
Your friend, Fabian, is going to speak.
I'd like to be there.
You know, Lily, sometimes I wonder whose side you're really on.
What have you got in the box?
My wedding dress.
Whiskey.
You're Señor Trumbo.
Yeah. Who are you?
It is of no consequence.
You're a friend of
Señor Fabian's, are you not?
What about it?
Señor:::
As you may have observed,
I'm a little drunk.
It's not a habit,
I assure you.
Sometimes a man has thoughts.
I'm Don Luis
Rivera y Hernandez.
In California, that is an honorable name.
With honor, a man should be more careful.
Do you agree?
I wouldn't know.
Your friend Fabian speaks tomorrow.
You got any objections?
Don't let him.
If you have any influence with your friend,
take him away from Monterey at once, señor: At once!
Why?
I do not like to see a man killed in cold blood.
Thanks.
Pour one for me, too,
Don Luis.
I'm going to drink to your health.
Ahoy.
Better be hurrying over to the hall, Johnny.
You're not going to the hall, you're going home.
Home?
I got something to tell you.
You're in trouble.
I've been in trouble ever since I became a politician.
They're gonna try and kill you, Grandpa.
Who told you that?
A drunk.
And you'd be worrying about the word of a drunk.
Yes, well, he's dead for telling me.
And there's something else you better know.
It is I who got you into this.
I didn't give a bent nickel for what you were fighting for.
I wanted to fix Coffin, and this was one way of doing it.
That's why I got you to run against him.
Sure. I knew that the day you brought the boys to see me.
All the same,
I'm glad you told me.
You still going?
Yeah, I'm going.
It's that important to you?
Not just to me, Johnny.
You forget the folks who voted for me.
They want a decent government, and they kind of thought that
I'd help them to get it.
They had faith in me. I've got to keep faith with them.
You should understand that,
Johnny.
I think I do.
Well, if it's that important to you, it ought to be that important to me.
Let's go.
I ask you, why are certain delegates in this hall so insistent on rushing
California into statehood?
How can we even discuss it when there are so many problems requiring long and careful study?
The boundary question, for one.
I say this whole measure is ill-considered and premature.
Statehood now can only make
California a pawn in the conflict already threatening to separate the rest of the country.
Order! Order!
If this measure is passed, it is inevitable that those favoring an independent empire, a republic of California, they must either separate themselves from it or contest the decision by force of arms!
Gentlemen, order!
Mr. Fabian.
Mr. Speaker. Gentlemen.
Talk, talk, talk.
For five weeks now, there's been nothing but talk in this hall.
Well, I suppose that's what a convention is for, talk.
But a minute or two ago,
Mr. Willoughby was talking and he made a slip of the tongue.
Ah, more than that.
Mr. Willoughby let the cat out of the bag.
And a clawing, screeching cat it was, and a very thin bag he was in.
Independent empire, said Mr. Willoughby, and then made off it was a slip of the tongue.
Ah, it was more than that.
Independent empire.
That's the scheme they have, the scheme to wreck this convention and wreck the future of California.
Order!
Now, I'm a simple farmer.
What I know is the sun, the soil, how to make grapes grow.
I'm not a politician.
But I know who's in that scheme for an independent empire.
And if a simple farmer knows, you all know, every man jack of you knows.
And the men in that terrible scheme aren't here to tell you what the people of California want.
They're here to tell you what one man wants.
You all know who he is.
Captain Pharaoh Coffin.
Order!
That man wants to run
California all for himself, but it's us who settled it.
And it's a land for the people like all the United States.
We want to make it a state, not an empire run by Captain Coffin.
That man's trying to get his way by bossing this convention.
Next, he'll try it with guns and wholesale murder.
Now, I say that's nothing but treason.
Here we are, men from every state in the Union.
We're farmers and millionaires and everything else.
What we want California to be is what she should be, another state in what I believe to be the greatest land on earth.
Gentlemen, there'll be a ten minute recess.
Keep me well covered.
That was real good!
Look out!
Dead.
He didn't have a chance.
Pick him up.
He was the finest man
I ever knew.
Nothing but cold-blooded murder.
You gotta have some law and order around here, all right.
That was a bad move, Coffin.
I've nothing left but powder and shot.
Not for me.
Me either.
Personally, I'm going to be on that stage when it leaves this afternoon.
Anybody care to join me?
Well, is he here?
Si, señor, he is in the chapel.
Get Miss Lily at once.
Si, señor:
Hurry!
Oh, good morning, Padre:
You brought your beads, your things?
What is it you wish of me?
A wedding.
The young lady will be here presently.
I want you to marry us.
A wedding?
And those armed men are the wedding guests?
This is more than a wedding, little man.
This is a coronation.
I should have got a bishop, but you'll do. You'll do.
I cannot perform such a ceremony.
What?
There'll be no ceremony.
Señor Coffin, you are a man of blood.
You cannot use the holy church as you would your chapel.
Your church, you and your mumbling breed.
I'll tear out every root you have in California.
Your hands cannot reach deep enough.
I'll be using your missions for pigsties, I...
Where is Miss Lily?
You heard me, come here.
Where is Miss Lily?
Her bed has not been slept in.
She's gone.
It's a lie.
You knew.
Since last night.
I helped her.
Get out, both of you.
Get out.
Get out!
Captain.
Captain.
It's me, Pike, Captain.
I got to have a word with you.
Why haven't you gone?
I gave you my orders.
Supposin' Fabian ain't back from Monterey, yet.
He'll be back.
If he isn't, there are plenty of others to dispose of.
Remember, he's the most important.
Have done with him.
And I want no blunders.
But, Lily,
I can't run away now.
Michael, you don't seem to understand.
You don't know what
Pharaoh Coffin is capable of.
If I leave with you and let him have his way,
I can never come back, nor can you.
You know that.
I'm not coming back.
Once I thought California would be big enough for me.
It isn't.
Everything I've touched, it's as if it had a curse on it.
Even you.
Oh, Michael, come away before something happens.
What's this?
Hey! Hey!
I tried to tell him.
He wouldn't listen to me.
I was too late.
We were all too late.
Better lift him to his cabin.
Well?
Well, your orders have been carried out, Captain.
Including Fabian?
We done him in proper.
He'll make no more speeches where he's at.
You came back, Lily.
Yes, Pharaoh.
I came back.
You blundering swine.
Get out of my sight!
Lily.
Lily.
We're going into town.
Get moving.
Close the gate!
Spread out! Spread out!
Tom, see that every man who has a rifle uses it now.
Pick off anyone that shows his nose over that wall.
We got to keep it well covered.
I'll keep them all shooting.
We'll never make it now.
They got the gate shut.
We've thought of that.
Frank?
Yeah!
You got it?
I sure have.
Let me have it.
Keep us covered!
Come on, Frank, let's go!
Hey, Frank, Bob!
Come on!
All right, stick to the walls!
All right! Wheel it in!
They've forced the gates,
Captain.
We're done for, scuppered.
But I have a pair of horses by the side patio.
There might still be time to make a run for it.
More water, Elvira.
We're alone, Pike.
Stark, Barrett, Willoughby walked out on me, saved their skins.
Come on, come on. We'll ride out of here, get back to the sea.
Who was it who struck her?
You must hear me, Captain.
It's off now or we're dead, both of us.
It was you who struck her.
You struck her, Pike.
Now get out.
Get out!
Aye, aye, sir.
What do you say, Bosun?
How goes the night?
Where's Pike, eh?
Pike?
Pike!
Pike!
Hmm.
You betrayed me, huh?
Took the keys, unlocked the chains, and set those
Black slaves free, hoping they'd help you.
Help you...
Where is the sun?
Where's the sun?
How can I see a Black against the dark?
Only hear them.
Hear them.
Pike.
Pike. Pike! Pike!
Yes, I know you hate me.
I took you out of Africa and the stinking fever.
I put you in chains, yes.
Yes, but you struck her.
And now you want to kill the master, eh?
Well, you fool!
What'll you do when the wash ships over the guns?
What'll you do when the mast goes by the board?
What'll you do when the night comes down?
Pike! Pike! Pike!
Oh!
So it's you.
You are going to die.
I remember these vines when they were just a bunch of dead sticks.
You know, it's as if I was seeing them for the first time, the way Michael always saw them.
Yes, he saw a lot of things most folks missed.
Well, this is goodbye, Lily.
Where are you off to, Trumbo?
Got a date with the army, remember?
How long does it mean?
A year.
Two, maybe.
Trumbo...
You'll come back, won't you?
Where'll you be?
Right here, waiting.
A silver watch and five dollars in coin of the realm... for every southern settler who will leave here... for the rich and fertile plains of Kansas.
The south needs your vote.
We want no five-dollar voters.
We want no silver-watch settlers.
We want to people Kansas with good, hardworking, northern farmers.
There ya are, sir. As mean a molar as ever I did see.
Give me two dollars and we call it square. What do you say?
All right. Must've hit you pretty hard to loosen up that tooth.
- What's the trouble?
- I said President Pierce was a polecat.
Which he is!
Then he popped me.
- Just wait till I get him in Kansas.
- Don't blame you in a bit.
- Are you a dentist?
- Am I a dentist?
My friend, you're looking directly at the best dentist west of the Mississippi.
What seems to be your trouble?
Big fella back there belted me on the mouth.
Right in the chair. Right in there. Sit down there.
- Nothin' about Pierce, I hope.
- Why, yeah. Who told you?
Excuse me, partner.
I don't want no trouble with you, mister. Just leave me be.
I'm mindin' my own business.
You mind yours.
Stranger, I ain't a-carin' whose wagon you're fixin'.
Wasn't talkin' to you in the first place.
But in the second place, I still think we can do with a better President.
So what are you gonna do about it?
Well, all right, mister.
You asked for it.
Right after the Mexican war, my wife says to me, she says,
"Andrew, you know what this country needs?"
I says, "no, what's it need? "
She says, "needs more dentists. "
Well, it did, so I become a dentist. Say "ah".
- Ah!
- There we are.
Hey, we ain't doin' bad.
Made $34 last three days.
Well, I can't go around popping people all my life.
And am I askin' ya to? Who were ya when I met ya? Nobody.
Standing around in Texas. Wantin' to travel and see the country.
Well, you're seein' it, ain't ya?
Yeah, and I ain't likin' it. You told me I'd see mountains and oceans.
This country ain't no different than Texas. Ain't as good.
I know, but travel costs money, son.
- You sayin' I ain't earnin' it?
- No, I'm not complainin'.
You knock 'em loose.
I pull 'em out.
Maybe, I'm just sayin' maybe, you know, if you was more promiscuous with your punchin', we might make a little more money.
What you mean,
"promiscuous"?
Well, you got strange ideas about justice.
Don't wanna hit nobody unless they deserve it. Now that's all right.
But we're in business.
Business is different.
I don't know, doc.
You're gonna lose yourself a partner unless we get out of this territory pretty quick.
'Cause I aim to see them mountains you were talkin' about.
You got a memory like an elephant. Giddyap.
- Bite of tater, doc?
- Can't. Break my plate. Giddyap.
Whoa! Where do I find your camping grounds, mister?
- Edge of town, just past the schoolhouse.
- Much obliged.
Hyah!
Land where my fathers died,
land of the pilgrims' pride
- Doc?
- Yeah?
- Hear that?
- Sure, pretty.
Gives me the goose pimples.
- Sick?
- No, just proud.
Hello. Would you mind moving?
I'd like to get through.
I said, would you mind moving?
I'd like to get through.
Oh, excuse me, ma'am, but I ain't had a chance to hear such pretty singin'... in a long time.
You wouldn't believe it, but music does something to me. That kind of music.
- Why, I can remember...
- That's all very interesting, but are you going to move this wagon, or shall I have it moved for you?
You know, doc, all them stories we've been hearing about Kansas must be true.
Even the womenfolk think nothing of threatening strangers in the open.
- Good morning, Miss McCloud.
- Good morning, Mr. Cantrell.
Would you be good enough to ask him to get out of the way?
He's so enchanted with your music class, he refuses to move.
Your interest is very gratifying, sir.
First time our singing lessons have ever held up traffic.
If you'd care to, we'd be delighted to have you join us.
Thank you, mister. In that case, I reckon we'll move on.
Giddy out of there.
Beautifully done,
Mr. Cantrell.
You certainly know how to say the right thing at the right time.
Except where you're concerned.
Oh, well, you've held me speechless with your eloquence.
That's just what
I'm complaining of.
I want to leave you with just enough speech to say one word, but you never do.
Maybe I should change my tactics.
You think I'd say yes at the point of a gun?
If I thought you would,
I'd be armed to the teeth.
Oh, then you'd scare me to death.
I'm goin' into town to rent an office.
Take about a month, the way I figure, to fix all the teeth in this town.
Of course, that's not countin' the ones you'll send in.
Then we're headin' west.
California and mountains.
No hurry, doc.
Take your time.
I wanna look this country over good.
Well, if you ain't the contrariest critter I've ever seen.
- Will you put that gun away?
- No, sir, I will not.
I won't warn you again. Now put that gun away. Give me that gun, I say.
- No, sir, I'm over 21-
- Boys, boys, please.
Don't you raise your voice to me, young Scallawag, have you no respect for your father?
Now give me that gun.
Well, I'm gettin' tired of being treated like a kid.
Mary!
- Ellie! Ellie!
- Do you know how much that cost?
Ellie, take up the carpets and let's have plenty of sawdust on the floor.
And also several cuspidors.
Now let me see.
Oh, yes, we can put the beer barrels over there and a bar where the piano is.
Oh, and there I want a large picture of dancing nymphs.
But be sure and keep this space clear for brawling purposes.
What are you raving about?
Both you and Fletch act like you're in a saloon, so I just thought I'd make you feel at home, dad.
I'm sorry, dear.
Well, go on, apologize to your sister for making a deplorable scene.
- I'm sorry, sis.
- All right, Ellie, you may go.
But don't forget the sawdust, just in case.
Now what's all this yelling about a gun, anyway?
The hot-tempered young fool must carry a gun, because the place swarms with yankees, and he wants to get into trouble.
Now listen, sis.
I'm old enough...
Stop yelling at me! A southerner never raises his voice!
Never.
That's right, dear.
Follow your father's example.
He never forgets himself.
Well, I'm gonna tote a gun, and no one's gonna take it and offend me.
Fletch McCloud, where in the worid did you pick up such language?
"Tote", "offen. "
Give me that gun.
A cowboy came through town one day, and he got big ideas.
He's been wanting to tote... carry a gun ever since.
Fletch, I just saw a ruffian with a gun.
He was no match for will Cantrell, who merely used his brain.
- Yes, but...
- Oh, hush.
Now, not another word out of you.
Go along.
Stop aggravating your father.
- Oh, dad, I wonder if you'd let me
- No!
You two, shame on you.
If I weren't around, you'd be at each other's throats all day.
What are you gonna do when I get married?
Don't you worry about us.
Did Cantrell ask you to marry him?
- Uh-huh.
- Good, splendid.
I didn't say I'd accepted him, now, did I?
Oh, he's a smart man, Mary. Ambitious, hard worker. Be a big man someday.
- I like a little one I can boss around.
- Oh, no, no, no.
I'm serious. He'd make a good husband for you, that lad.
His grandfather was scotch.
I wouldn't think of getting married until you and Fletch are old enough to stop fighting.
The carriage is ready, sir.
Thank you, Tom.
I'm gonna be in Dodge City for about a week.
If I could know you'll take Cantrell,
I could buy you a handsome wedding present.
What are you, a banker or a matchmaker?
There you are, sir.
Ha! Smooth as a baby's... leg.
Your honor, them's the kindest words
I've heard from a judge in years.
Mostly they say,
"thirty days. "
My friend, you may paint a shaving mug with the name "judge Buckner"... and count upon me as a steady patron now that you're established.
- Two bits.
- Oh, tut, tut, tut.
I shall settle with you weekly.
Or, perhaps, monthly.
You'll sum up my account...
I beg your pardon, madam.
He's an excellent shave, madam.
Oh, I'm sorry, madam.
Good morning, ma'am.
- I wish to have a tooth pulled.
- Yes, ma'am. Will you be seated, please?
- There ya are.
- What's this?
- Imbibe, madam, or suffer.
- I do not imbibe.
Very well, ma'am.
Now, if you'll kindly place your right knee against my chest.
Why, I've never heard of such a thing in my life. I'll tell my husband.
Just for leverage, ma'am.
Just for leverage.
Say "ah. " There we are.
I take a short trip out of town, and look what happens.
Four killings in a week.
It's got to stop.
Four?
Did you say four?
That's right, four! Well, we're getting to be quite a town, aren't we?
I doubt if they have that many in
Dodge City. No, I don't think so.
We aim to compete with any city in size, but not in lawlessness.
Certainly, of course, four killings is outrageous.
The judge was saying,
Mr. McCloud, before you came, that the appointment of a marshal is obviously in order.
- If I can find the right man.
- I have a nephew.
He's a fine, upstanding young man who..
Who you'd like to see on the city payroll.
Well, the man we need must be honest, must have courage, know how to handle men.
- Have you any suggestions?
- Wait now, there's my nephew.
- He's out!
- We really felt, Mr. McCloud, that you'd probably make a nomination.
Gentlemen, I think I know the very man.
- Look out for the ruts, Will.
- "Look out for the ruts. "
There you have the story of my life.
Only I never did look out.
Always been in one.
Look at me now.
A schoolteacher.
- Where's that going to get me?
- Where do you want to go?
I think I could go clear to the top if I thought you'd be there waiting.
Why not go to the top anyway, just for the climb and the view?
All right.
I'm from Tennessee.
What of it?
We ain't wantin' people around here who sell their votes.
I don't have to sell mine.
I got abusiness of my own.
Smart Aleck, huh?
What do you say, boys, we give him a lift out of town?
Take your hands off of him.
Who might you be?
Nothin' to you. I just said, keep your hands off.
You talk mighty big for one man. What right do you got to butt into this?
I'll tell ya, ya pack of coyotes.
A man born in this country is an American. Don't forget that.
It's his right to...
.. go where he pleases, and it's my business to..
Come on, Mary.
Hit him in the teeth, Bob, in the teeth.
- Let me give you a hand, mister.
- Thanks. Where'd you come from?
- Been followin' you around all mornin'.
- What for?
- You're a cowboy, ain't ya?
- Yep. From Texas. Why?
Ah!
Sure, that's the way it is. Them doggies are the boldest I ever rode herd on.
It's like sometimes out on the range after you got the herd bedded down...
- That's my tongue.
- My mistake.
- Ever had your tooth pulled?
- No, all good.
You're lucky. Say, you really busted that knuckle, didn't ya?
- Oh, it ain't nothin'.
- No, I've had lots of 'em.
Here's what I always use.
Thanks, but you ain't told me if I'd go out on the range, what's the first thing they're gonna ask me?
For chewin' tobacco, most likely.
There's something
I wanted to ask you.
- Me?
- Yeah.
You know that girl I was staring at when all the ruckus started...
- Yeah.
- Well, who is she?
Well, her name is
Mary McCloud. Why?
Well, I'll tell ya.
I think maybe I'll marry her.
What?
Of course, if she'll have me,
I mean.
A fella wouldn't want to marry anyone that didn't want him, naturally.
Oh, naturally.
You know her well?
No, just seen her once or twice.
- Once she was on a horse.
- The next time she was with a jackass.
He is, huh?
Makes it easier, don't it?
Practically a cinch. You do things kinda sudden, don't ya?
No, not exactly.
But, you see, I got her figured out this way.
If you like someone and you don't tell 'em right off, why, maybe all that time you wasted, she liked you too, so, well, all that time's wasted, ain't it?
It is, the way you put it. How do you expect to go about this?
Oh, yes.
Glad you mentioned that.
Uh, I figured that if you was to take me over to her and...
.. give me an introduce, then I could tell her who I was and that..
.. I never murdered nobody, and..
...you could go somewhere and sit on a fence till I was through.
I'm sure you won't be long.
Well, come on, I think she's over at the bank.
- I forgot to ask you your name.
- Fletch.
Mine's Seton. Bob Seton.
You got a first name?
Yeah. Cupid.
He's a real cowboy.
From Texas.
This is her father's bank.
Owns a bank, huh?
What do you know?
He don't like cowboys either.
I can tell you that.
Yeah, I know the breed- string-hollered and spavined.
Squeeze the blood out of a turnip.
- Keep your chin to yourself.
- Huh?
I mean, you wait here, and
I'll go bring her.
Fair enough.
I don't know how to express my appreciation, Mr. McCloud.
I suppose it will be left to a vote, huh?
Naturally.
There will be other candidates throwing their hats in the ring, but you're not going to have any trouble winnin'.
I hope you're right.
Fletch, what's the matter with you? Where are you dragging me?
Friend of mine here wants to talk to you.
You, uh, wanted to talk to me?
Uh, yes, that's sort of the idea.
- Well?
- Uh...
Did the squirt tell you who I was? Who?
The kid, Cupid.
Ain't that a name for you?
You know, him that went in and asked for you.
- My brother, you mean.
- Yeah. He and I...
Your what?
My brother.
Who did you think he was?
- Well.. your brother!
- Yes.
- You see the fight?
- No.
We lost... almost.
Was that what you wanted to talk to me about?
Well, not exactly.
That is... no.
Then what was it?
Well, uh, did he say anything to you... about anything I'd said to him?
My brother, you mean?
- Yes.
- No.
- He didn't?
- No.
Well...
...back there in the office,
I had this all figured out.
Out there on the prairie, it seemed easy. You got blue eyes.
- I beg your pardon.
- Yes, sir, blue eyes.
Oh, let's see now.
Where was I?
Bob Sexton, from Texas.
Ma died when I was 9 years old, and about 8 months ago...
I'll do anything you say,
Mr. McCloud.
And, once again, thank you very much.
Good luck to ya.
Where's Mary?
She went across the street to buy a spool of thread.
Oh, well, I'll go...
I wouldn't do that if I was you, Mr. Cantrell.
She always gets a little fidgety when she's buying a spool of thread or something.
Dad, you tell him about me goin' to be a cowboy. Go ahead and tell him.
That's the only time I was ever in jail, and it was the other fella's fault.
I was drunk.
Drinking, of course, constituting no crime.
Ma'am?
I said, drinking, of course, constituting no crime.
I'm gonna learn big words myself someday.
Now look.
I've listened to you very patiently.
I've heard your whole life's history.
I know what to do for cattle who've eaten too many loco weeds, why sulphur in molasses isn't as good as people think it is, and a thousand other things that I've forgotten already.
Now will you please get to the point and tell me what you want?
- I want to marry you.
- You what?
Well, I ain't got no job right now, but I figure to get one.
Outside of a snort of hooch now and then, I got no bad habits.
I'd say asking perfect strangers to marry you is...
...is a very bad habit!
You lookin' for someone, ma'am?
Yes! Surely they don't let you out alone, do they?
We got a sayin' down in Texas that... a fella doesn't get anyplace unless he tries.
Well, you might as well give up trying, because it's not gonna help you.
- We got another saying in Texas
- Yes, yes, I'm sure you have. Good-bye.
That'll be four and a half.
Two for the tooth, two and a half for the whiskey, you got another swig comin'.
I ain't got cash.
Maybe you could take it in trade.
Oh, I was afraid of that. I pulled teeth in Boston once for a year.
Practically lived on beans.
Got some stuff outside that beats money in the bank in this territory.
Wagonload of guns. And they'd have been token away from me, if it hadn't been for that young friend of yours.
Ain't legal to run guns.
You know that.
What's legal and what ain't? Why, these towns ain't go no marshals.
You needin' a partner, mister?
- Mm, maybe.
- No, you don't. Oh, no, you don't.
He got hit in that fight. He don't know what he's sayin'. Listen, son...
- How about it?
- You can't, Bob.
I'm sick of this here city life.
Fella can't go around doin' nothin' all the time.
Yeah, I could make a good gunrunner outta you.
Over my dead body.
Doc's right, son.
Gunrunning's not for your kind.
You ain't a wrecker, boy.
You're a builder.
Doc's right again.
You're the kind this country needs.
Suppose it sounds funny, for an old law-breaking coot like me to talk patriotism.
What do you have in that whiskey, stars and stripes?
I'll give you couple guns.
Shucks, you don't owe me nothin'.
Give your tooth back for a souvenir, if you like.
No, give it to the kid.
Someday when he sees me strung up at the end of a rope, he'll remember I gave him some good advice.
- Good-bye, gentlemen.
- Good-bye.
What is it, Bob?
Come on, son, what's wrong?
Still yearnin' for them mountains, doc.
- Oh-oh. What's her name?
- Mary Mc...
Say, there's no girl mixed up in this.
Same one we met coming into town?
Her? She makes me sick.
You know what?
Why, down in Texas, they'd laugh her out of town.
She don't know her own mind, that female.
Fella can't expect to win a woman unless he does something worthwhile.
Bet her old man cheats everybody in town.
See that poster?
Yeah.
What does it say?
Says they're looking for a new marshal.
It does, huh?
You know, Bob, you could make something out of yourself if you tried.
Yeah?
Yeah.
You could run for marshal.
Me be marshal?
Are you loco?
Well, you could try.
Better for a young fella like you to be workin'with uncle Sam than agin' him.
I can't read or write.
You know that.
Listen, you don't read and write a man into jail.
Marshal's gotta know something.
He's gotta have...
...papers on his desk and things.
Son, there's a school down the other street where they can learn... anybody to read and write.
They got little kids there ain't that high... readin' and writin' just as pretty as anything you ever seen.
Now, if I was you...
You're young, Mr. Seton.
Never too late to learn.
Look kinda funny, won't it?
Me sittin' there among all them kids?
Yeah, well, don't worry about that.
You and I will do our studying in the evenings, nobody'll know anything about it.
Will! Oh, Will!
You're a pretty regular fella. Thanks.
Uh... tell me...
...you say you can't write?
Make brands on cows is about all.
Tried to write with ink once.
Looked like an Easter egg for a week.
Oh, Will, your sup...
...your supper's ready,
Mr. Cantrell.
This is my housekeeper,
Mrs. Adams.
- Elizabeth, this is Mr. Seton.
- Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
Oh, I'm keepin' you from your supper.
There's no great hurry.
You were saying that...
Oh, yes.
Same way about spelling.
When I try, people laugh.
Call me "shortcut" down home.
What? You see, I spell
'em like they sound.
You know, bacon:
B-A-K- scrub- S-K-R-
- Well, go on and laugh.
- No offense, I assure you.
Tell me, why this sudden ambition?
Is it because you wanna learn?
Don't mind if I do. Fact is, I'm gonna be marshal of this town.
Oh, indeed.
Well, you don't seem very happy about it.
Well, should I be? I'm running for the office myself.
Oh, ain't that one for ya?
Here I just get to likin' ya, and now I gotta beat ya out of that job.
Didn't know you had company, Will.
- Oh, that's all right, ma.
- Pay no mind to his braggin', Will.
He ain't had no more learnin' than I have. You'll be elected.
It's not him I'm worrying about, ma. It's you.
I'm sick of this pretense.
Mrs. Adams, my housekeeper.
Every time I say it, the lie sticks in my throat. I'm not ashamed of you.
I know you ain't.
There's plenty of folks in Lawrence that make you ashamed, or try to.
And I don't aim to let 'em.
Leave things be, Will.
I ain't complainin'.
You wouldn't complain if they boiled you in oil, as long as you thought it would help me.
It's no use, ma. It won't work.
I'm going to send you back to Ohio.
I won't go, Will. We come out here together, and I'm stayin'.
All right. Let's see how things are after the ballots are counted.
But if I'm beaten by that cowhand,
I'm through with books and teaching.
I'm gonna burn every book in this house.
I'm going to the top if I have to go over the bodies of...
Will! Quit that wild talk. That's how your pa spoke before he...
Don't forget. I've got some of his blood in my veins too.
Thank you, my friends. I have talked a lot about myself, and you have been most indulgent.
Now, then, I want to say something about Mr. Seton, my opponent.
You will observe that I say
"about" and not "against, " because I know nothing against Mr. Seton, neither as my opponent nor as my pupil.
My most promising pupil.
Within the hour, you will go to the polls, and you will elect either Mr. Seton or myself.
If you elect him, you will get a man who is honest.
And, my friends, Mr.
Seton is a man of courage.
Plenty of courage. But honesty and courage are not enough.
Today, more than ever before, a public office calls for knowledge.
You must know law and how to apply it.
And that, my friends, calls for intensive study, to which, as you all know,
I have devoted many years.
Our town has grown to a size where we need a marshal.
Be sure you elect a man who can grow with the town.
Thank you.
And now, friends, I present
Mr. Cantrell's opponent.
He calls himself Bob Seton and says he comes from Texas.
I know nothing more about him. In fact,
I had a tough time finding out that much.
- I gotta get outta here.
- Uh?
- I'm sick.
- Bob, listen to me.
Come on, doc, your job is pulling teeth out of people's mouths, not putting words in 'em.
Let him speak for himself.
Come on, let him talk for himself.
The judge here is right about that speech.
Doc wrote one out for me, all right, but he forgot I couldn't read.
Folks, it's true.
I don't know much about the law.
Ain't had much book-learnin'.
But the good lord gave me a nose for smellin' a horse thief a mile off.
And what you need in these parts, is a marshal that's better at smellin' than spellin'.
Mr. Cantrell here says that I'm honest, that I ain't afraid of nothin'.
He didn't say I was too dumb for this job, but that's what he meant.
He's right. Lamdumb.
I'm dumb enough to think that smart marshals do their shooting' first, their talkin' afterward.
Folks, this country has more laws than there are ways to skin a skunk.
Thousands of 'em.
Why, back east, they tell me there's a law against spittin'.
But remember this: before you can try 'em for anything, you gotta catch 'em.
I can catch 'em.
- What's so funny, Mr. McCloud?
- Lots, miss McCloud.
Don't you like the way
I'm arranging the table?
I was just thinking, what would happen if Cantrell didn't get elected.
That's stupid.
How could he lose?
Did you ever hear the story of the tortoise and the hare?
I'm not at all interested in a tortoise.
Maybe not, but you ain't been the same since.
"Ain't. "
Since what?
- Since he proposed to you.
- Oh, bah!
Bah, yourself. You can't tell me you was so mad.
No, I'll admit I wasn't.
It was the other fella's fault.
I was drunk.
He's either the most stupid man in the worid or too naive to be without a keeper.
The voting's over!
They're cheering for Will!
How much did he win by, dad? Cantrell didn't win.
That high-heeled cowboy is the new marshal.
- That'll be enough out of you!
- Yes, sir.
I better start learning to tote a gun.
It's gonna be the fashion from now on.
Father?
And nobody's gonna take it offen me.
Ellie! Ellie, you can clear all this away now!
I'm gonna get mine quick.
Well, howdy, marshal.
- Hiya, Fletch.
- Boy, am I glad.
- Well, what do you want?
- Nothin', ma'am.
You once told me that I wouldn't mean anything even if I tried.
Well, I tried.
Are you here on official business, Mr. Marshal?
No, ma'am, personal.
What does that say, Fletch?
"Good luck to our new marshal. "
That's right kind of you to go to all this bother for me.
Oh, it isn't any bother at all. Only...
...it isn't for you.
It's for Mr. Cantrell.
Oh.
We got a sayin' down in Texas, ma'am, about countin' your chickens before they're hatched.
Mm-hmm. Have you also got a saying down in Texas...
...about people knowing whether they're wanted or not?
Fletch, you hear that?
I sure did, marshal.
We also got a sayin', ma'am, that...
...women don't always say what they mean.
Do you mind telling me briefly why you're here?
Yes, ma'am. I was a little hasty a couple of weeks ago...
...askin' you to marry me.
There was something
I should've told you first.
Oh, that's all right.
You told me.
You were in jail once, but it wasn't your fault. Uh-uh.
I should've told you first that I love ya.
That's what I really came over for tonight.
Oh, there I go again. There's something I should've done before that.
- What, for instance?
- This.
Now that's the right order in which things are done in Texas.
Don't do it, Will. Don't do it. It ain't right.
Well, I'm sick of doing what's right.
I'm sick of teaching school...
- ... getting nowhere.
- Will, listen to me.
If it's Mary McCloud you're thinkin' of, she'll like you if you ain't got a penny.
Learning, studying, working like a dog. What does it get me?
First chance I have to be somebody, I'm beaten out of it... by an ignorant cowhand who can't even write his own name.
Well, I can write my name, and I'm gonna write it across this territory in fire and blood.
I'm going to be somebody in this country, somebody big.
Stop it, Will! Stop it!
You ain't gonna take that road.
That's why we come here from Ohio,
Away from the rottenness of your brothers.
Will, I taught you different.
There's good in ya.
And it's stronger than the bad that's in your blood.
Will, I've already seen three of my sons turn bad.
Rather than see you follow 'em, I'll kill ya.
Me that give you life.
I know what I'm doing, ma.
I'll be running Kansas yet.
I'm going clear up to the top.
But I'm not going for the climb or the view.
Pile in there. We're taking you across the border. You're free.
Get off my land! We don't want slavery in Kansas.
Where do we take this batch?
Run 'em across the Missouri border.
They should bring about 300 a piece.
You're slowin' up, Cantrell.
I expected more than this.
That's the last of it. I'm through with slave running. Too risky.
Fella named John Brown got himself hung for it.
It's gunrunning for me from now on. It's healthier.
- What's the matter?
- Couple of men are complainin'.
They'll get their money when we get over the ridge.
They're figuring to take this stuff to the border and turn back.
Listen, Bushrup, they're paying us plenty of money for these guns.
I promised to deliver them in Kansas.
Now, if you can't do this my way, somebody else will.
Sure. Sure, anything you say.
There. There they are.
Come on, let's get 'em.
Easy, Fletch. Take it easy.
Whip 'em up, boys!
Did you get a good look at him, Bob?
Maybe.
Take that stuff on into town.
I'll see ya later.
It's pretty late to be stoppin' by.
Oh, that's all right.
You'll find me burning the midnight oil most nights.
Saw your light on in the window.
Mr. Cantrell, I need some legal advice.
I'll be glad to help you if I can.
Couple of points of law
I'm not so sure of.
You got a territorial code book handy?
Uh-huh.
Got one right here.
It's practically my bible.
Glad to hear that, teacher.
I hope you abide by it like a
Christian does the good book.
What do you want to know, marshal?
Penalty for smugglin'.
What sort of smuggling?
Unlicensed arms into federal territory.
All right, here we are.
"Five years imprisonment,"
$5,000 fine or both.
Five years, eh?
It's a big slice out of a man's life, teacher.
What's your point,
Seton?
Point is, someone tried to run in 500 rifles tonight.
Mm-Hmm. I figured on a gun run once myself.
Even I was too smart for that.
Mr. Cantrell, you're one of the smartest men I've ever known.
- Now, if I didn't like ya...
- Now, just a minute.
You're not accusing me, are you?
No, just tellin' ya.
I'd rather give you advice here in the schoolhouse...
...than to lock ya in the jailhouse.
Why, you're a crazy man!
Gunrunning and school teaching don't mix. Don't you know that?
I know it.
Make sure you do.
So I'm learnin' Fletch how to be a good cowhand.
He's learnin' me to be a gentleman.
Fletch made a better deal.
You're being cheated.
- How so?
- Good morning, Will.
Good morning.
I'm not settin' so good with your friend, Mr. Cantrell.
Why?
I think he's got the idea that
I'm tryin' to steal you away or something.
And?
Well, I think maybe he's right. Giddyap.
Looks like this man
Lincoln's liable to win, with the democrats dividing up between Douglas and Breckenridge.
Looks like a heap of trouble.
Yep. Ruckuses in the south.
Ruckuses in the north.
Looks like war just around the corner.
Well, all I want's to be let alone to raise Kansas wheat.
South trouble ain't no concern of ours.
Well, I don't know.
You feel south or north, depending on what's in your heart.
Heart nothin'. It's a matter of pocketbook to the south.
Yes, sir, what they want's free labor.
In a northern mill, a man's got a chance to earn a living wage.
Eight and sometimes ten dollars a week.
Cheap slave labor.
That's what the south wants to fight for.
All this talk about southern tradition and chivalry.
Well, there is tradition there, Mr. Hale.
Which Mr. Hale can hardly appreciate.
Oh, one of Jeff Davis' boys, huh?
Well, I'd like to see this southern tradition and chivalry before I change my mind.
That's a wish that'd be hard to gratify.
Southern homes keep your kind in the stables.
Yeah? Well, maybe if you had a meal in the stable once in a while, after a hard day's work, you'd come down off your high horse, you and that rich banker father of yours, livin' high off of other people, talkin' big.
Never did a day's work in your life, neither of you.
You're a liar, Mr. Hale.
I'll kick the tradition and chivalry out of you.
I'll teach you to...
Come out! Come out of your fine house and look at it!
Murderers!
Go on and tell 'em, Mrs. Hale.
Yes, I'll tell 'em.
You'll have plenty to eat this winter. What about us?
Who's gonna bring in our wheat?
Where's my husband?
I'll tell ya!
Murderers!
Murdered by your fine young snob of a son!
Look, Bob, we're not in Maryland or
Virginia where the laws are so rigid.
This is the frontier. I have the right to have my son released on bail.
Set the amount as high as you like.
I'll post it in cash right now.
I'm sorry, Mr. McCloud, but I just can't do it.
You bought a horse today from Martin Claussen.
The fastest horse he owns.
Well, that horse could take a man across the border and into safety.
Would that be so awful?
He's only a boy.
He's old enough to carry a gun and use it.
He'll have to stay in my custody.
You'll sit there and calmly sentence my boy to death. You can't do that.
But he'll be safe, Mr. McCloud.
He'll get a fair trial.
Release my boy on bail!
Please, dad.
Let me speak to him.
Bob, I'm not going to argue with you about right or wrong, or duty or law.
I'm pleading with you for the life of my brother.
I can't.
It-tt wouldn't be right.
I don't care whether it's right or not!
Doesn't it mean something to you that I'm asking you to do this for me?
That boy adores you, Bob.
He idolizes you.
He wants to pattern his life after yours. Doesn't that mean something?
Mary, I'd like to.
Then do it. Do it for me, for him, for all of us.
I can't.
When I took this job...
...it got under my skin.
I took an oath...
You took an oath the other night that you love me.
You asked me to marry you again.
You swore that...
Bob, Bob, please.
Please, I'll do anything for you.
I want you for my wife more than anything else in the worid.
But not as a bribe for your brother.
I thought they bred men of flesh and blood in Texas.
I was wrong.
You're made of granite.
No, Mary, just common clay.
Bakes kinda hard in Texas.
So, Seton promises I'll get a fair trial, does he?
Don't lose heart, Fletch.
You'll be a free man soon.
Oh, don't raise our hopes unless you can do something.
I promise you more than your friend, the marshal, if you leave this in my hands.
Are you sure you're going to vote guilty?
That's none of your business.
You've got a family and future to think of, farmer.
When you vote, think of them.
Remember that you got a family and future to think of.
When you vote, think of them.
You've got a family and future to think of.
When you vote, think of them.
Gentlemen, you have heard all the witnesses, and now you know the facts.
Or shall we say, the so-called facts?
For it must be obvious that a great deal of this testimony reeks of prejudice.
Our community is predominantly northern in its sympathies.
Yet, the defendant, Fletcher
McCloud, is a southerner.
He happens to believe in the sovereignty of the south,
Believes in it so fervently, that he fought with hale over the issue.
Yet, it is his privilege to hold to that belief.
It is not within your power...
...to bring hale back to life.
But it is within your power, by ruling out that prejudice to which I have referred to... and by rendering the proper verdict, to give life back to this boy.
Look at him, gentlemen.
Look at his sister... and his father.
None deplore the spilling of blood more than they do.
Their hearts are full of compassion for the family of the deceased.
They are ready and eager to make whatever amends lie within their power.
And already they have arranged to see that Mrs. Hale and her children are well cared for.
Gentlemen, pain and torture...
...are grim bedfellows.
If your verdict be hasty and mistaken, you will forever after know no peace.
You don't want a tragic mistake on your consciences to haunt you all the days of your life.
You have families and futures to think of.
When you vote, think of them.
Bear them in mind when you seek a verdict.
This same thing might have happened to anyone of you... or to members of your family.
Yours is a solemn, awful responsibility.
If you find this boy guilty, death.
Swift death for Fletcher McCloud.
But an endless, living death of fear and terror and torment to each and every one of you who will have wrongly condemned him.
Gentlemen of the jury, you have heard the evidence.
You may now retire and try to come to a verdict.
This message just came over the telegraph, marshal.
- Wait!
- It's important, Bob.
The judge ought to make an announcement.
If they get wind of this before they bring in a verdict, Fletch is as good as hung.
Gentlemen of the jury, you have come to a verdict?
Yes, your honor.
We have.
We find Fletcher McCloud... not guilty.
I'll never be able to repay you, Will.
Will, you were magnificent!
I'm so happy.
Well, I guess you can tell 'em about this now, judge.
My friends, I have news, bad news, I fear.
The south has seceded from the union, and war has begun.
This will not be a war of short duration, as many people think.
It will be as deadly and as fiercely fought as any civil war in history.
Now, you men have thrown your loyalty to me, and that loyalty will be amply rewarded.
You're not fighting for the north, and you're not fighting for the south, but you're fighting to take what's coming to you!
The fine gentlemen of Kansas and Missouri...
...will be fighting each other in a war over something we don't want any part of!
And the longer they keep each other busy, the better we're gonna like it.
We're gonna live off the fat of the land, and what we don't want, we'll burn.
I'll show you fellas more liquor than you ever saw before, more money, more anything you want!
Come on, now.
Let's take it from 'em!
You'll hang for this, every one of ya.
You can't steal honest men's money!
What have you got, Bushrup?
Nothing but a bunch of uniforms.
Burn 'em up!
Uh, wait a minute,
Bushrup.
Get your men into them.
From now on we'll be confederate soldiers.
Come on.
Deal 'em out.
If you're afraid, boys, we ain't askin' you to sign.
But if you're lookin' for excitement, get the old John Henry down on paper.
What you gonna do when you catch 'em, doc? Pull their teeth?
You should have no difficulty tracking down those guerillas.
Why, these fine men are ready to lay down their lives if necessary, in order that the fair name of Kansas would stand...
Just sign 'er right here, judge. Eh? What's that?
Enlistment blank. We can use a smart man like you right up in front.
Very funny.
Very funny, indeed!
You might use your wit to a better advantage in tracking down those guerillas, or at least trying to find out who the leader is.
Didn't I tell ya? I knew this would happen the minute that Lincoln fella got elected.
If those guerillas hit town they'll clean house!
Won't do more than the government's doin'.
They upped taxes to raise money for the northern army.
The south doin' the same.
I hear Angus McCloud and that crowd are sendin' plenty down.
And who's money is it?
It's the money in his bank, your money he's sendin' to the south!
I warned ya before, but you kept saying I was a bit tetched because I'd lost my old man.
Well, you're gonna pay for it now!
You're gonna be as poor as me!
And ya ain't never gonna get it back!
I'm gonna get my money outta that bank.
Come on.
We want our money.
There is your money, mayor Barstow, and shame on ya.
Who made you a loan when your wheat failed? I did. I had trust in you.
Well, I'm a better banker than you'll ever be a farmer. All right. On your way.
Take over here and pay off as long as you can.
Yes, sir.
Calm down, folks.
This bank's solid.
Just because we're recruiting is no sign for you to run loco.
Well, do somethin'! Don't stand there like a bump on a log.
They'll get their money if they give me time. Their money's safe.
They're wheat farmers.
There never was a war fought... and there never will be that didn't send the price of wheat sky-high.
There's nothing I can do about it, if they want their money.
You got us into this with your flag-wavin'.
You're the law. Stop them.
Fools, cowards, pack of scared rabbits! I'll show 'em!
My father's bank is safe!
Listen to him!
Can't you make them listen?
Give him a chance to talk to ya.
Your money's safe.
Hey, son. Give me that gun you're so fond of totin'.
That's better.
Now there's a little quiet,
I can tell you what a snivellin', blatherin', cowardly lot you are.
You'll get your money if you give me time.
But money's not like water that you can draw out of a spigot.
- Skinflint!
- Liar! - Crook!
Call me a skinflint if you like.
Call me a user if you've a mind to, but don't call me a thief and a liar!
You'll get your money. This bank is sound! Your money's safe, I...
That's what comes of carrying a gun, son.
- Take care of him, doc.
- Oh, what did he do?
Dad? Dad!
You're to blame for this.
You killed him!
You didn't get me so you got him!
Steady, boy. Steady!
Four days and nights
I've been waitin' for ya.
Where ya been?
Tell me the truth.
I told you the truth.
In the army.
What army?
The confederate army.
You're lyin' to me, Will.
You ain't fightin' for the south or the north.
You're fightin' with the hosts of darkness, and the devil's ridin' aside you.
That's enough. My life's my own, and I'm going to live it.
Yes, and the road you've taken you'll end up on the gallows!
I can take care of myself.
You don't understand, ma.
Things are different now.
You're not going to have to pose as my housekeeper any longer.
I'm a rich man.
You're going to have fine things to wear and a big house to live in... and servants.
I want no fine house,
No servants.
For years I've been proud to serve you myself, help you.
I'll have no part of your new life, your new riches.
People are askin' questions why you ain't here, Will.
Who? Fletch was here asking for ya yesterday.
Said his sister's leavin' Kansas, goin' east.
It's funny, isn't it, Will? We can pack things like these so carefully, and yet our plans, our lives, even, get smashed no matter what we do.
You're much too young to be so bitter and cynical.
I don't feel young anymore.
Dad's gone.
Fletch wants to join the south. I can't stop him.
You too. You belong to the southern armies.
You're in danger right now, just by visiting me.
I've got to get away from here.
I can't stand it any longer.
Yes, but where are you going to go, and then, what are you going to do when you get there?
Don't go east, Mary.
Come with me.
I don't have to tell you that I'm in love with you... and that I've always hoped someday you'd marry me.
I know, Will.
- But...
- No, no. Don't finish it.
I know what you're going to say.
You were going to say, "but I don't love you, Will. " Weren't you?
Yes, it's true.
I don't love you.
But I do like you.
I always have.
You've been a good friend.
Mary, stop packing a minute.
Come here.
Look at me.
Will you marry me?
Will, I'm the daughter of a Scotchman.
I couldn't marry you unless I gave you my honest opinion first.
I think you're making a bad bargain.
I've got scotch blood too.
I won't be the loser.
Does that mean you will marry me?
Yes, if you want me.
Maybe I can teach you to love me.
To love honor and obey so long as ye both shall live?
I do.
Then I pronounce you man and wife.
- Where can I find the marshal?
- What's up?
Bushrup's guerrillas are sackin' Thomasville!
I'll take ya over!
Fletch, you take
Mary up to the house?
Will, what is it?
- I've got to leave.
- Got to leave?
They're not guerrillas.
They're southern troops, part of my detachment.
But why do you have to...
If they're not warned they'll be ambushed and wiped out.
I'm goin' with you.
I'll get the horses.
Will, I don't understand.
Mary, I've got to do this, and I haven't time to explain, but I'll come back to you soon, darling.
- Don't fire till I signal.
- Wait a minute.
You can't shoot 'em down in cold blood.
This is war, youngster.
Bob. Bob, come on!
Yah!
Yah!
You say it's Cantrell.
You've been sayin' it for weeks.
Why, you had half the town wasting time searching, and still nothing's been done!
Now, this kind of thing...
Quit debating, judge, and get to the point!
I'll save ya the trouble, judge.
You want a new man.
All right. Get one.
Been ridin' myself saddle silly and listening to your snivellin' long enough.
Been stayin' here against my will as it was, trying to do the decent thing and carry out my end of the deal.
Well, you're relievin' me of that, and that's fine.
Maybe I ought to thank you.
Cantrell and his guerrillas have been raidin' north, south, east and west,
But they ain't been around Lawrence.
Any of you fuddleheads ever stop to figure out maybe it was because... they're afraid to tangle with your late marshal?
I've had you in my barber chair day after day, and many's the time I've wanted to slit your fool throat from ear to ear.
I'm glad I didn't know.
That'll be for Cantrell to do when he gets here ridin'.
Well, the point's well taken.
- Ungrateful pack of hyenies.
- Forget it, doc.
Hey, what's goin' on up there?
They're gonna run
Cantrell's wife outta town.
Why don't you all go upstairs?
Don't listen to that trash out there.
What are you standin' there for?
Didn't Cantrell kill your friends and relatives?
She's no better than him!
Go on!
Run her outta town!
- Clear outta here, all of ya.
- He ain't the marshal no more!
That's right, I ain't. So your laws don't bother me no more.
The next one of you polecats throws anything is gonna get a law busted right in his face.
Now, get out.
Come on, get out of here.
Break it up.
Go on. Get out of here, all of you.
Thanks for trying to help.
Well, you can't blame 'em too much.
A lot of 'em have had kinfolk killed.
Yes, I know. I...
I'm going.
Well, where?
Missouri, near Dorrance.
- Relatives there?
- Yes. My husband.
- To him?
- Yes.
Mary, you can't.
You're better off here.
He's my husband.
My place is with him.
Oh, you know what he is.
You've heard the stories.
I know the lies that have been printed because this is Kansas and he's fighting for the south.
They're not lies.
They're the truth.
- He's nothing but
- You want to believe those lies... because you want to believe that I made a mistake.
If you're of the same mind in the morning,
I'll take you to him.
I'm leaving Kansas myself.
How much further is it to the border?
We'll cross it in a couple hours.
Place you're headin' for is eight or nine miles down the road,
Hill country.
They say it's lovely too.
Don't know what lovely country really is till you've seen Texas.
- Texas.
- In the springtime.
The range is covered with lupine-bright... blue, blue as your eyes.
Well, almost as blue.
Bob, I think we better get going.
Mary, you remember the first time I met you,
When you kept looking around for my keeper 'cause...
...you thought I was too crazy to be out by myself?
Yes.
Well, you better start lookin' around again,
'cause I'm going to say something crazier than that.
I know you're married to him, and I got no right to say this, but I still love you.
- Oh, Bob.
- You don't love him. You never did.
Bob, please.
I got a ranch in Texas.
I want to drive you down there.
Will you go with me?
Will you?
Bob, I can't.
Please don't say any more.
Hyah!
- This is where I leave you.
- Yes.
You sure you won't change your mind?
No, Bob.
Where'll you be going?
Texas.
Good-bye, Mary.
Good-bye, Bob.
Hey, Will! The boys are bringin' your wife in.
Picked her up outside of camp.
Mary, darling.
It's... been a long time, hasn't it, Will?
Mary!
Fletch! Oh, Fletch, it's so good to see you again.
Listen, sis, you took an awful chance comin' across that water territory alone.
But I didn't come alone. Bob Seton brought me within a mile from here.
Seton?
Yes, he was about the last friend I had in Lawrence.
Fletch, as soon as you get those wagons rolling, come back and have dinner with us.
Come on, dear.
Like it?
It's going to be my headquarters, permanently, so I wanted to have it just as nice as possible for you.
Surprised?
I'm amazed.
I expected to find you in some shack, or...
War has made a great change in you, Will.
It took a grubbing schoolteacher...
...and made a major out of him,
- Gave him all this.
- Where did it all come from?
I bet you used to ask that question when you were little, in just that same tone, when you found all the presents under the Christmas tree.
No, no.
I'm serious, Will.
I want to know.
Well, technically, they're called the spoils of war.
And all through the fighting, darling, uh...
...this will prove that I was thinking of you.
Take it.
Open it up. It's yours.
Will, I want to ask you something.
Well?
I've heard a lot of ugly stories that you're...
Will. Will!
Look what we picked up.
I had a tough time saving him for ya.
The boys wanted to trim a tree with him.
Bob.
Untie him, Bushrup.
Mr. Seton is here as my friend, not as my enemy.
While he's in camp he is to be treated as my personal guest... and shown every courtesy.
Yes sir.
As your guest.
Uh, you'd probably like to wash up a bit. Phil?
Yes, sir?
Take Mr. Seton to my quarters.
See he has everything he wants.
You'll find him practically at your beck and call.
Later, my wife and I trust you will do us the honor to dine with us.
Thanks.
Now, now, now.
Don't worry.
I'll make myself personally responsible for his safety and comfort.
Ah, Seton. You're prettied up fit to kill.
- Have a drink.
- No, thanks.
I, uh, have a feeling your stay with us is going to be rather brief, so I'd like to extend every hospitality.
Had I known you were around this neck of the woods,
I'd have posted signs saying "keep out",
But, unfortunately, you couldn't have read them.
You learned me to read figures pretty good, though, Cantrell.
Uh-Huh. There's some don't quite add up.
What's that?
General Beauregard and the fifth army are...
...a long ways from here, yet that doohickus on your collar says fifth army.
What sort of doohickus would you like on the uniform of your firing squad?
- Firing squad, eh?
- Yeah.
Oh, that's right. You're an officer now, and a gentleman.
I was figuring it'd be a rope party.
Oh, no, Seton.
After all you've done for me... the least I could do for you would be to grant you full military honors.
Like the way our mess is run?
Pretty good turkey there, isn't it?
Yeah.
First time I ever had two kinds of bird with one meal: turkey to eat and buzzard to look at.
Put that knife down, Seton.
You heard what he said, didn't you?
I'm a fair hand with a bowie knife, mister.
I'll put this through the first one of you pulls a gun.
Oh, well, we're all famished and waiting for you.
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- Sit down here, darling.
Seton, over there.
Where's Fletch?
Sit down, boy.
I came to tell you
I'd rather not join you.
- Why not?
- Not with Mr. Seton here.
Oh, well, suit yourself,
Fletch. We're hungry.
Good food, good wine and good talk.
What more could a man ask for? That right, Mary?
Yes, that's right, except, as dad used to add, good friends.
Oh, yes. Of course.
And, uh, we're lucky to have such a friend with us tonight.
Let's drink to an early peace, with honor.
I have a very personal reason for proposing that toast.
Something I haven't told you, Mary.
Yes? What is it?
I've bought a place in Virginia, right in the heart of the Shenandoah valley, the most beautiful estate you have ever seen.
- Shenandoah valley, eh?
- Uh-huh.
That fifth army really gets around, don't it?
You like Virginia, don't you?
Oh, yes. I think it's lovely there.
But before going, I think I'd enjoy seeing the whole south.
Well, why not?
Bayou country, Louisiana and
Texas should be interesting.
I was just thinking a few minutes ago I'd...
I'd like to go to Texas.
Well, if luck's with us, there's no reason we can't do it.
Make a grand tour, including Texas.
Be sure and make him comfortable on your side of the camp.
He needs a good rest.
In there.
- Let him stew for a while.
- Well, I'm goin' down there now.
No. You let Seton alone.
I don't want you going down there.
I'll take care of him myself.
Give me that gun.
Wait outside.
Here. Bob, you were right about Cantrell.
We've got to get Mary outta here.
Will, I'm not blind. I've seen enough since I got here to prove those stories
I heard in Lawrence are true.
I don't care what they think about me in Lawrence or anyplace else.
I'm only interested in what you think.
For years I sat in that schoolhouse thinking of you, dreaming of you.
I wanted to be able to offer you the moon on a golden platter.
I regret nothing I've done, and I'll do it again. I'd plunder a dozen states...
...to get you and to keep you.
I'm your wife. I came here of my own free will.
I'll stay here as your wife, on one condition.
- Something involving Mr. Seton, no doubt.
- Yes.
Safe passage for Mr. Seton through your lines, and proof that he got it.
All right.
For such a prize,
I can afford to be generous.
- Where's Fetch?
- I think he called on your friend.
Nothing to worry about, Mary.
I'll be right back.
Where'd those shots come from?
- Fletch in there?
- Yes. I think he gave it to him.
- I thought I told you to let...
- Turn around, mister.
Get over there.
Get over.
Cover the door, Fletch.
- Can you get some horses?
- I've got a team all ready.
You better get Mary.
- Where will you be?
- At the bridge.
Come on, Fletch!
Have yourself a good time.
Do we have to go through the camp?
That's the only way out.
Cantrell ain't gonna raid
Lawrence tonight. He's got company!
Get on those horses!
Bushrup, stop that wagon!
Bob, look!
Yah!
What's the matter?
Cantrell and his guerrillas are headed this way.
Doc! Wake up the town!
- What's up?
- Fletch is hurt.
Get Dr. Lord, bring him to the McCloud house.
He went to Newton this morning, but I'll take the case.
- But he needs medical assistance.
- And he'll get it, lady.
You're looking directly at the best doctor west of the Mississippi.
Come on. Get up!
Wake up, everybody!
Come to life!
Wake up in there! At this hour of the night? What is it?
What is the meaning of this?
Cantrell and his raiders are comin'.
Well, that's no reason to get everybody up in the middle of the night.
Who?
Cantrell.
Oh, the militia! Nobody's here, they're gone. I sent them to Doddstown.
He'll burn everybody in their beds, like he did at Thomasville.
Get the women and children into the town hall, all of 'em, fast.
What do we do? What do we do? Great Scott!
I never expected that.
I thought it was in Doddstown.
Had a tip and sent the militia.
We've got to surrender. We've got to surrender, I tell you!
Are there any wagons in town, or did the militia take them all?
Yes. I mean, I don't know!
Who would have expected that?
There are 30 or 40 of them, marshal.
Well, get 'em.
Yes, get 'em! Get 'em!
Martha!
Martha, bring down my gun!
The one with the long barrel!
Bring on them wagons!
Hurry it up!
- Did you get through to Doddstown?
- I can't. The lines are down.
He's... he's still unconscious, isn't he, doc?
And lucky.
Can't feel any of this.
Last time I did an operation, I...
When...
When was that, doc?
Eleven years ago.
I believe in you.
I know you can save him.
I'm gonna try mighty hard, Mary.
Do you think you could get some bandages?
Oh, sure.
I heard your brother was hurt.
I come over to see if I could help.
How is he?
He's badly wounded. He was shot getting away from camp.
It's better you ain't alone here.
Oh, Mary! Hurry up with those bandages.
Oh, all right.
I'll handle this situation. There's nothing to worry about! Be calm!
Take cover!
We'll have to burn 'em out.
Get a wagon ready.
Injun tactics.
Look out!
Get back!
I spotted the wagon your wife got away in. It's in front of her house.
You know your business here.
Hey, Seton! Cantrell's riding up north creek road.
Be out in a few minutes.
Where you goin', Will?
What are you doing here?
Where's Mary?
She's busy.
Will, you ain't goin' up.
What's the matter with you?
What's that gun for?
It's for you, Will.
I thought I'd borned a man child when I first heard you squalling, but I didn't.
I borned a dirty, murderin' snake that's broke my heart to see it crawlin' along.
You're no good, Will.
I've killed a lot of men for saying less than that.
You've killed a lot of men for sayin' nothin' at all. Kansas is red with bleedin'.
I curse the day
I ever had you.
Stand where ya are, Will!
You've done enough to her.
You ain't goin' nigh her again.
Ma. Ma!
Speak to me.
Ma, are you all right?
Oh, I wouldn't have hurt you no matter what happened.
I'll kill the man that fired that shot.
Give over killin', Will.
It won't change nothin' now.
You're at the end of the road, and the devil's aside ye,
Waitin'.
Don't.
Get out of town!
The militia's coming!
- Well, hello, doc.
- I done it. I remembered how.
I was afraid my hands had lost their cunning, but I done it.
Jumpin' catfish, I'm out of the barberin' business.
I'm a practicin' physician again!
My scissors.
Where's my scissors?
Don't worry, doc.
Here they are.
I guess Lawrence has burned to the ground.
Yeah.
Well, we got a sayin' down in Texas that it...
...takes a good fire to burn down the weeds, let the flowers grow.
You've got a saying in Texas for just about everything, haven't you?
Ever hear what William Shakespeare said? "All's well that ends well. "
Shakespeare, huh? Well, he must have come from Texas.
We've been sayin' that down there for years.
"While the Harvey system neither demands nor expects...
"...the impossible from any employee, it does insist upon honest...
"...excellent, hygienic, cleanly, prompt and cheerful service at all times."
Yes, siree, Bob.
And he means every word of it.
You've been with him a long time.
I've been cooking in Harvey Houses for the last 14 years.
You must be well-done by now.
Madame! You say your coffee is weak?
Give it to me.
I'll put it on the chair and let it rest awhile.
Just call me "Conscientious Connie," the queen of the waitresses!
I'm sorry, Miss Bliss.
That's all right, Ethel.
There's one thing you girls have yet to learn:
A Harvey girl is more than a waitress.
Wherever a Harvey House appears, civilization is not far behind.
You girls are the symbol and the promise of the order that is to come.
The restaurant we're opening in Sandrock is the first the town has ever had.
Its success depends upon how you conduct yourselves.
Now, how about some lunch?
It's lovely. I'm hungry.
- Here, let me help you.
- Thank you.
Have you ever eaten a Chillicothe sandwich, Deborah?
- Chillicothe? What's that?
- It's a secret recipe of my Aunt Melvina's.
Won her two blue ribbons and three husbands.
- Try it to see if you like it.
- No, thanks. I'm full.
- Would you like to try it?
- Why, yes. Thank you very much.
I always wanted to taste a Chillicothe sandwich.
Tastes just like chicken.
You have to try another before you can tell the difference.
Thank you. I hope I'm not depriving you.
If General Custer had our provisions, he'd still be standing.
I've wanted to meet you ever since we got on the train at Kansas City.
My name is Susan Bradley. I'm from Ohio.
- We're Harvey girls.
- What's that, a college?
No. We're waitresses.
We're going to Sandrock to open a restaurant.
Sandrock! That's where I'm going.
- Is that your home?
- No.
- Are you visiting?
- No.
- Going to work?
- Then why on earth are you going?
To get married.
- Does he live in Sandrock?
- Yes, he owns a big ranch there.
- What's his name?
- His name is H.H. Hartsey, Esquire.
Is he tall and handsome, and does he have raven-black hair?
And flashing blue eyes?
I like brown eyes.
- His are brown.
- You said they were blue.
Well, they are. I mean, one of them is.
I mean...
Well, to tell you the truth,
I haven't met him yet.
- How did you catch him?
- I answered a matrimonial ad in the paper.
Well, really!
I once sent my picture to a lonely hearts club...
...but it came back marked,
"We're not that lonely!"
Well, I think it's wonderful.
I think it's wonderful, too.
When I answered the ad, he wrote back.
Thank you very much.
- What wonderful curlicues.
- And commas after everything.
This is the first one.
- Would you like to hear a little of it?
- Yes, indeed. Please.
"There is a dream here, in this great land, that not everybody sees.
"Mountains and sunlight, and the cleanest wind in the world...
"...waiting for a man and a woman with a little vision."
What was so wrong with Ohio?
There was nothing wrong with Ohio.
It was just so old-fashioned.
There were several men in that town
I could have married, I suppose.
Only, it's so smug and sure of itself and so settled...
...that I wanted a chance to do something different...
...to see something different, a whole new world opening up.
And, after all, the Constitution guarantees the pursuit of happiness...
...but it's up to me to do the pursuing.
So that's why I answered the ad, and that's why I'm on this train.
I think you did the right thing.
- Would you like to see my wedding dress?
- Yes.
I must say, I admire your spirit.
Most girls would have come out here and gotten married in a navy blue suit.
That must be Sandrock!
Mrs. H.H. Hartsey, Esquire.
Mighty nice looking sign you're putting up there, Mr. Adams.
You being the manager of the place...
...I suppose you're optimistic enough to think it's going to stay there.
There are a lot of them around the country, Judge...
...and I haven't heard of any of them failing to stay put.
It's a pity you'll be disillusioned so soon.
- Hi, Judge.
- Hi, boys.
- How are you, Judge?
- Good day, Judge.
Hello, John Henry.
Hey, Mike, where's the boss?
Right over there.
Trent, I want to talk to you.
There's a lady singing.
- That's a good number.
- Terry taught it to me.
- Good work, Terry.
- Thanks.
- It's really Em's voice that puts them over.
- My voice? He's so young.
Trent, I got to talk to you.
What is stopping you, Sam?
The lady's finished her song.
- Hey, boss.
- Yeah?
- Is he good for a drink?
- Has he had it?
- Yeah.
- He's good.
Now, look here, Trent,
I've wasted all the time I've got to waste.
Got a match?
Mighty nice looking place you got here.
Next year, we plan to put up lace curtains.
Not if you have to shut down, you won't.
Who's going to shut us down? You?
You know what I mean.
You can't laugh off the new Harvey outfit.
Have you ever seen a restaurant?
They serve food.
Next, the church will open up again.
Mark my words.
Are you boys admiring each other's eyes or reading each other's epitaphs?
Em, the Judge is losing his grip.
He's afraid of a place that sells vittles.
Vittles and a pack of calf-faced girls.
Those girls can fill up a town faster than law officers.
- You listen to the Judge, Ned.
- This is my business.
Let's get one thing straight:
We're not partners.
You run the town, I'll run the Alhambra.
You'll get your usual cut.
But not just as much.
He's right. Look what happened at Larrup.
The men married the waitresses faster than they could replace them.
They did?
It's so quiet, you'd think it was
New England instead of New Mexico.
- Nice women can ruin a town, right?
- And how.
- The house will buy you a drink.
- That's a little better.
- Where's Trent?
- He's over there, at the bar.
Hey, Ned!
It's all due to you.
- How can I ever thank you?
- What?
- My bride's coming in on the noon train.
- You're married, Hartsey?
I ain't, but I will be.
She's come all the way out here from Ohio to marry me.
And here's the fellow what's done it.
It was him. He writ the letters for me.
He courted her for me on paper.
Hartsey, maybe you'd better hightail it to the desert.
- I'll meet her and send her back to Ohio.
- It's like a blind date for life.
You don't know what you're doing.
You can't tell by letters.
She probably weighs 200 pounds.
That's all right.
This calls for a celebration.
Hey, everybody.
Hartsey will be married this afternoon.
I'll treat to champagne.
Here's to H.H. Hartsey and his rosy happiness...
...coming in on the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe.
Do you hear that whistle down the line?
I figure that it's engine number forty-nine,
She's the only one that'll sound that way.
On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe!
See the ol' smoke risin' round the bend,
I reckon that she knows she's gonna meet a friend,
Folks around these parts get the time o' day
From the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe!
Here she comes!
Ooh, ooh, ooh,
Hey, Jim! yuh better git the rig!
Ooh, ooh, ooh,
She's got a list o' passengers that's pretty big
And they'll all want lifts to Brown's Hotel,
'Cause lots o' them been travelin' for quite a spell, on the way to Cal-i-forn-i-ay
On the Atchison, Topeka
On the Atchison, Topeka
On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe!
Oh, the roads back East are mighty swell,
The Chesapeake, Ohio and the A. S. L.
But I make my run and I make my pay,
On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe.
Goin' back 'n forth along these aisles,
My lands, you must'a walked about a million miles
It's a treat to be on your feet all day
On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe.
Here we come!
Here she comes, comin' down the line.
Raa-du-raa, du-raa, du-ra-ra-raa.
On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe!
She's really racin' down the line.
Choo-choo-choo, choo-choo-choo, Santa Fe!
Looky, looky, looky, looky look!
Atchison, Topeka, Santa Fe!
Oh, boy, we're huffin' an' a-puffin' on the Forty-nine!
In this day and age, girls don't leave home,
But if ya get a hankerin' you wanna roam,
Our advice to you is run away
On the Atchison, Topeka an' the Santa Fe!
Faith and didja ever see such purty femininity
Arrivin' all at once in this h'yere town?
In this h'yere town?
Never seen the likes o' this for miles aroun'.
Round and round our heads are spinning,
New adventures are beginning.
What a length a gal'll go in tarfety 'n calico
To really put a cowboy on the bosh!
Cowboy!
Cowboy!
Kibosh!
Kibosh!
It's enough to make a feller wanna,
Wash your face and hands, we hope, you'll never be afraid of soap!
Button shoes and powdered chalk,
An' fancy smells and baby talk
Hit's awful what a gal'll stoop to do!
Even so, we aim to say,
We'd love to honor and obey, Bee!
Are there any more at home like you?
Hand me my hair-comb and my stickum,
Gonna get spruced up and out-trick 'em.
Put on the dog and out-city slick 'em.
Mister Harvey, Mister Harvey,
Fred Harvey knows exactly how to pick 'em.
We come from Dubuque, I-oway,
That's where the tall, tall, tall corn grows;
We come from Lousiana
Where the Miss-iss-iss-iss-ippi flows.
I was the Lillian Russell of Cherryville, Kansas, but they never gave me a chance!
I finished high school in
Providence, Rhode Island, and Providence, Rhode Island, is where I learned to dance!
Oh, I'm from Chillicothee,
Ohio!
My middle name's Hiawathy.
Ohio!
I'm gonna get the gold in them thar hills,
So, I said goodbye-o, Ohio.
We were schoolmarms from Grand Rapids, Mich,
Readin', writin', 'rithmetic were not our dish.
I was born in Paris,
I was raised in Paris,
Went to school in Paris, where I met a boy.
I was married in Paris, almost buried in Paris, but I finally left Paris...
Paris, Illinois!
So, this is the wild and the wooly West,
Give me my chaps and my checker'd vest!
Get me a gun and a holster for my hip,
Bang, bang!
Yip, yip!
What a lovely trip,
I'm feeling so fresh and alive.
And I'm so glad to arrive,
It's all so grand.
It's easy to see,
You don't need a palace,
To feel like Alice in Wonderland.
Back in Ohio, where I come from,
I've done a lot of dreamin' and I've travell'd some,
But I never thought I'd see the day
When I ever took a ride on the Santa Fe
Wanna take a ride on the Santa Fe!
I would lean across my window sill,
And hear the whistle echoing across the hill;
Then I'd watch the lights till they'd fade away,
On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe.
- What a thrill!
- What a great big wonderful thrill!
With the wheels a-singin' Westward Ho!
Right from the day I heard them start.
'Cross the Kansas plains through New Mexico,
I guess I got a little gypsy in my heart.
When I'm old and gray and settled down, if I ever get a chance to sneak away from town, then I'll spend my busman's holiday. on the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe.
All aboard!
We came across the country lickety-split.
Goin' ninety miles an hour, fit to be tied.
I can't believe we're here at last.
When you go traveling, it's natch for you to take the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe!
I can't believe that anything would go so fast!
Then your pullin' throttle, whistle blows
A-huffin' and a-puffin' and away she goes
All aboard for Californi-a!
- On the Atchison...
- On the Atchison...
- On the Atchison, Topeka...
- On the Atchison, Topeka...
- On the Atchison, Topeka and...
- On the Atchison, Topeka and...
On the Atchison, Topeka an' the Santa Fe!
- Miss Bliss?
- Yes.
- I'm Jed Adams.
- How do you do?
- Welcome to Sandrock.
- Thank you.
I want you to meet Mr. Adams, the Harvey House manager.
Miss Walters, Miss Johnson,
Miss Harper...
Why, you rambunctious coyote!
I'll teach you.
- Wait a minute, ma'am. I'm Mr. Hartsey.
- I don't care who you are.
But, ma'am, ain't you Miss Susan Bradley, the lady that came out here to marry me?
That's Miss Susan Bradley back there.
If you ladies will please follow me.
We've been awaiting your arrival.
Really? That's very nice.
Who are they?
Ladies! Ladies!
How do, Miss Bradley?
Hello, Mr. Hartsey.
- Can I carry your bag, ma'am?
- My bag? Where?
I thought we was going down here to...
Yes, please, do. Thank you very much.
- Are you disappointed?
- Disappointed?
Well, I mean, you didn't expect a mangy old buzzard like me, or did you?
Yes, I did. I mean,
I don't think you're a mangy old buzzard.
I mean, I...
You look like a very kind and reasonable man.
Then you like me?
You mean you really like me?
I, of course, don't know you very well, but you...
...certainly look to me like a very kind and reasonable man.
Thank you, ma'am. I like you, too.
Thank you.
Of course, there's one thing I forgot.
I left it out of my letters.
I'm an awful housekeeper.
That's all right.
In these parts, we live outside mostly, anyways.
- I'm a terrible cook.
- Don't let that worry you, ma'am.
Out here, we just put things over a fire and take what happens.
Well, that's just fine, isn't it?
It's great. I can't wait for us to be hitched up, can you?
Can't wait.
- I'm going to be the happiest man in town.
- I'm going to be the happiest girl.
Well, after all, that's what I came out here for, isn't it?
Well, yes, ma'am.
Miss Bradley, I think you should know something more about me.
I chew tobacco and I drink.
I'm a terrible drinker.
And I gamble.
Gambling, that's my downfall.
Well, Mr. Hartsey, you sound as if you...
Could it be possible you don't want to marry me?
Wait, Miss Bradley. I want to marry you.
I want to marry you badly.
I want to marry you something awful, but please, ma'am...
...please say no.
Mr. Hartsey, I think you're wonderful.
Of course, if you insist, I'll say no.
I sure do thank you, ma'am.
Well, anyway,
I thought your letters were beautiful.
Gosh, I didn't even write them letters.
They was written by a fellow named Ned Trent.
Who's Ned Trent?
That was Ned's idea, all in the first place.
You know, I bet he thought that'd be some kind of a funny joke like.
- A joke?
- Yes, ma'am.
You mean,
I've come 2,000 miles for a joke?
- Where will I find this Ned Trent?
- Well, he's right inside there, ma'am.
Miss Bradley, you can't go in there.
Pardon me, which one is Mr. Trent?
- The guy over there without the hat.
- Thank you.
- Mr. Trent. Mr. Trent.
- See me later, I'm busy.
Wait a minute.
- Mr. Trent!
- Go away, will you?
Not until I've talked to you.
If it's about a job, grab a drink and I'll see you later.
- A drink?
- Open.
Call and raise.
- How many, Trent?
- Two cards.
How many?
Holding a kicker?
My grandfather always said that...
Hang your grandfather!
If he were alive, it's more than likely he'd hang you.
Who are you?
What are you doing in this place?
I'm just somebody who doesn't like you,
Mr. Trent.
I don't know if you're a thief or a murderer, but I know one thing: You're worse.
I never met, or read, or heard of anyone lower than you are.
You're a yellow-dog, Mr. Trent. Good day.
- Who was that?
- I don't know...
...but I'm sure going to find out.
Hey, wait a minute!
What was that all about, miss?
"When the setting sun lowers its mantle of gold...
"...over the valley that shall be our home..."
The letters! You're Hartsey's...
- But you couldn't be!
- Well, I am.
Susan Bradley.
Well, look, take this and go on back to Ohio.
Nothing's happened...
...except that a nice girl has had an interesting trip.
Oh, wouldn't you love it if I went back to Ohio?
Me and the other nice girls who came out here today!
Well, they won't.
Whatever you and the other cutthroats do, we won't.
Listen to me. If anybody leaves here, it'll be you and your kind.
Men who run gambling palaces and send lying letters to girls...
...and sell a lot of liquor to drunkards.
Before we're finished with this town, you'll swallow those letters you wrote...
...and yes, I hope you choke on them, too!
- Miss Bliss.
- Yes, Susan?
You've got yourself another Harvey girl.
Dining room to the left.
Lunch counter to the right.
Ample notice will be given before the departure of the train.
- Hi, Goldust. When did you blow in?
- Just passing through.
You've got too much class for these prairie dogs.
Come to the coast with me.
No dice, Goldust. Keep asking.
It's good for my morale.
- Going to have supper with me?
- As a matter of fact, I'm dining out.
- Harvey House?
- I'll stroll over and size up the competition.
Yours or mine?
What do you mean?
I'd still like to know what was in those letters.
If I did, I'd probably know you as well as you know me.
It's no mystery, Em.
Why do you go out alone in the desert all the time?
- Who said I do?
- Everybody knows you do.
What have you got buried in that valley?
You wouldn't believe this, Em, but I've got nothing in that valley.
It's nice to look at.
See you later.
- Your order, sir?
- I'll have a great big sirloin steak.
One steak.
- Welcome to the Harvey House.
- Thank you, Miss Bradley.
- How would you like your steak?
- Rare.
Rare. Potatoes?
- Just the steak.
- Just the steak.
If you can get it.
We're famous for our steaks, Mr. Trent.
We'll have your steak in a minute, sir.
Hey! What did she do that for?
I wasn't finished.
It's because of your manners.
In a place like this, you don't blow on your soup.
You fan it with your hat.
One sirloin steak, rare.
- We ain't got it.
- What?
No roast beef or lamb chops...
...and not a single one of those famous Harvey steaks.
- The meat's disappeared.
- And so has our manager.
I think I know what's happened.
- Anything could have happened.
- You think somebody stole all that?
I'm looking forward to the steak.
You shall have it, Mr. Trent.
Get out, you drunk!
Stick 'em up!
Come on. Stick 'em up, now!
Anybody that gets in my way...
...you're going to have to answer for the consequences.
So, come on. Stick 'em up!
Watch out, men. Be careful!
I'd rather have Deadeye Dick than a female with a gun in her hand!
Now, I'm from the Harvey House.
We got a lot of hungry people there waiting to be served.
And I don't want to hurt anybody.
Honestly, I don't!
But we're famous for our steaks, and I'm not going to let anybody stop me.
So, come on, get 'em up. Put 'em up!
That's right.
Now, you, tell me where that meat is or I'll shoot.
What meat?
Lady, your meat's in there.
Come on, boys. Get your hands up!
Mr. Adams, are you all right?
John Henry, go there and untie Mr. Adams.
I need strong men to carry this meat.
- Right away.
- Pick up the trays. Come on.
Get it back to the Harvey.
You ought to be ashamed.
We have people to feed there.
Come on, hurry up.
- Let's get moving!
- Mr. Adams, will you take this?
- John Henry, get these down here.
- Yes, ma'am.
Come on. Hurry up. March.
Come on. Out.
Thank you very much.
I just want to thank you all.
My!
Did I do that?
I am sorry,
I didn't mean to let it go off again.
You've been very kind and thank you all very much.
- Good night.
- Good night.
One steak, very rare.
Good night, Arabella.
Look at that little goose pimple, all moon-eyed over a song.
I just came out for a breath of air.
- Deborah's romantic.
- It isn't that. It's just that I like music.
Imagine coming 2,000 miles from everywhere to hear a song like that.
And from a saloon.
Why did you become a Harvey girl,
Deborah?
I thought it would be exciting.
What I really wanted to be...
...was a dancer.
But my family thought it wasn't respectable.
A dancer?
- And you, Alma?
- I lived on a farm.
- Why did you leave it?
- I was hungry.
Well, here we are.
Yes, the three of us.
I don't know if we're the three musketeers or the three blind mice.
The low-down, crawling worm.
Shooting at women!
Ladies, I'm afraid we can call that the opening gun in the battle for Sandrock.
You can fight it without me.
I'm taking the first train out of here.
Girls! Please!
You'll not let this crude theatrical demonstration frighten you.
We won't stay here to get murdered in our beds.
I'm sure, when you calm down, you'll change your mind and stay.
If I stayed, it wouldn't be because
I changed my mind, but because I lost it.
I'm leaving.
Girls...
...l'd hoped you'd have the courage to see this through.
But if you insist upon leaving...
...that's a decision which you'll have to make for yourselves.
Good afternoon, Judge.
So you're back? Still peddling religion?
Sandrock needs it a heap-sight more than folks on the circuit.
We don't aim to have a church in Sandrock.
You've already got a church in Sandrock,
Judge.
All I aim to do is reopen it.
Listen, we agreed you were going to stay out of this town.
You agreed. I didn't.
You can't scare me the way you did those girls last night.
- Bullets are an old story to me.
- What's this about bullets, Sam?
- Mind your own business, Ned.
- I'll see you later.
There's always a gun popping off.
That's how it is. Boys will be boys.
They fired a bullet into the lamp where the girls were sleeping.
That's what I mean.
No harm done, and we got rid of four of them already.
Pretty good?
Reverend Claggett, go ahead with the church.
Why, thanks, Mr. Trent.
Ned, the Reverend doesn't have a sense of humor.
- I'm not joking. Go right ahead, Reverend.
- I will.
You go over to those girls right away and tell them not to worry.
There'll be no more accidental bullets in their lives.
Wait a minute, Ned.
We're in this together, aren't we?
But let's stick to the Marquis of Queensberry rules.
We should lick a bunch of women with our hands tied behind our backs.
That's the biggest mistake you ever made.
If they want a church to let off steam in instead of the Alhambra...
...I guess the Alhambra can hold its own.
Now, go on over there and tell them.
Well, now, that's a promising idea.
I'm quite sentimental about flowers.
I was discussing it with Reverend Claggett.
Reverend?
I thought they'd closed the church.
Yes, but we aim to open it again real soon.
There are some people who don't like the idea of a church here.
Mr. Trent, for instance.
They don't like having you ladies here either...
...but we figure to overcome their objections.
Yes, indeed, beautiful flowers.
A church, lovely young ladies like you.
This town is going to be something to be proud of.
- May I?
- Surely.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
A man's apt to forget his manners in a rough country like this.
- I'm Judge Purvis.
- How do you do?
I'm Miss Susan Bradley and this is Miss Deborah Andrews.
- How do you do?
- It's nice to meet a man like you here.
The pleasure is mine.
I hope we'll see a lot of each other.
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Good day, Miss Andrews.
- Miss Bradley.
- Good day.
He's nice, isn't he?
Well, at least there's one gentleman in Sandrock.
Now I know who fired that shot...
...l'm going to do something about it right now.
Slumming, Miss Bradley?
- I was just looking for your employer.
- You've got your own backyard. Stay in it.
You certainly don't mind my coming over to pay you a little call, do you?
In return for the call you folks paid us last night?
What do you want out of Ned Trent?
Nothing.
I want to thank him for all the hospitable things he's done for us.
- You're letting it go to your head.
- Letting what go to my head?
Listen, don't fool yourself.
Ned ain't doing this for you personally.
When he told Purvis to cut out the rough stuff, it was no love message to you.
When he told Claggett to open up the church...
...it doesn't mean he'll put on a pair of white gloves...
...and cuddle up to you in the front pew.
If you meant anything, he wouldn't have sent Judge to tell you.
Ned Trent can talk for himself.
But you don't mean anything to him, see?
He don't consider you worth fighting.
He'll give you your flowers and church.
You can sleep all you want at night.
But still he won't recognize you the next time he looks at you.
You're in love with him.
Me in love with him?
Why, he don't even know I'm alive.
Him and his valley.
Valley? What valley?
He doesn't even know you're alive either.
- You're not very sure of yourself, are you?
- Listen, you little insignificant...
I may be little, and I suppose I am insignificant...
...but I must be getting somewhere, my friends and I...
...or a significant citizen like you could never be so very, very worried.
'Morning.
You the new blacksmith?
We just opened up and I...
My name is Peters.
Most people call me Marty.
Well, my name's Maule, but where I come from people call me Tex.
- Where do you come from, Tex?
- Massachusetts.
Take good care how you shoe this horse.
Last time, they done it all wrong, and I didn't like it, see.
- Horse is like my own brother.
- There is a resemblance.
That is, I mean to say, you can trust me, sir.
I'll shoe him like he was my own brother.
His shoes are about six and seven-eighths.
There's one up there.
I'll be back.
Chris! What's the matter?
Marty Peters was here. He left his horse...
Marty Peters!
The one that shot the last blacksmith?
Yeah. He seems to think a lot of this horse and... He did what?
It's really only a rumor based on circumstantial evidence.
- No eyewitnesses?
- A few...
...but nobody actually saw the bullet leave the gun.
If you're going to shoe that horse, you'd better get started.
Alma, I've a confession.
- I'm afraid of horses.
- That's all in your mind.
- Say to yourself, "I'm brave."
- I'm brave.
- "I'm determined."
- I'm determined.
- "I'm fearless."
- I'm fearless. I'm a liar.
Come ahead, Chris.
Show the horse you're not afraid of him.
Would you please sit down and give me your foot?
That's not the way, silly.
See?
It's very simple.
All you have to do is take the pincers and pry all the nails from the foot.
Then you take a rasp and file the foot down.
Then you take a hot shoe, red-hot, and burn his foot to a level.
Then he's ready for shoeing.
Place it on his foot and drive six long nails into it.
I suppose I'll have to do it.
No.
Lose something, Miss Bradley?
Mr. Trent. Do you mind if I come down?
Thank you.
This country's not healthy for a woman,
Miss Bradley.
Why? Do you mean because I tripped?
That could happen back in Ohio.
But back in Ohio they'd find you.
It's certainly a nice view from out here.
- Is this where you usually come?
- Yes. Whenever I want to be alone.
I think that's a very good idea.
Getting off by yourself every so often.
It gives you a chance to think things out.
- What are you thinking out?
- Me?
I wanted to get a good look at a fellow...
...who'd run a saloon on one side and help a church on the other.
You're a little bit mixed up.
I'm not helping any church.
My, your valley is beautiful, Mr. Trent.
Almost as beautiful as your letters.
I said I was sorry about the letters.
I'm not angry about that.
I've forgotten about it.
I know you had a reason.
You did it for a friend.
It was kind of like John Alden.
Alden?
Yes. Don't you know the story?
Well, it seems there was a man in love with a girl.
Priscilla, her name was.
And he sent John Alden to propose for him.
John Alden said he would.
It's a wonderful story.
Anyway, right after John Alden finished proposing...
...Priscilla looked at him and said,
"Why don't you speak for yourself, John?"
Go on. How does it end?
I don't know. It's pretty silly.
I don't think you'd like it.
Why not?
I like all the things Longfellow wrote.
Miss Bradley, do you mind if I ask you something?
Do you suppose if I wrote a letter, a serious letter, that...
...some girl might be willing to marry me?
I suppose judging by me, Mr. Trent, that she'd take you like that.
I don't know.
Sometimes you don't even have to write.
That's a lot of trouble.
Sometimes all you have to do is that.
Some girls are just a little harder to get than others.
- Like girls from Ohio?
- Yes, Ohio will do. Yes.
Thanks for the story, Miss Bradley.
- You'd better get back to town.
- No, I think I'll stay here.
- It's not safe for a woman alone.
- Really, what could happen?
You could pitch off that cliff.
- We've got cliffs in Ohio.
- There are coyotes.
- What else?
- Not to mention a few million snakes.
We've got snakes in Ohio, too. What else?
You got that in Ohio, too?
Yes, we've got plenty of that in Ohio...
Here, here, what's the matter?
You all right?
Of course, I'm all right.
I bet you think that's the first time I've ever been kissed.
Isn't it?
Big, strong man.
I bet you carry smelling salts when you go out with a girl.
- Did you want some?
- No!
- It's been a lovely afternoon, Mr. Trent.
- I enjoyed it, too, Miss Bradley.
- And now we part.
- Right.
And you disappear back...
...into the gilt and glitter of your charming establishment.
How many men do you think would stay here without the Alhambra?
Sure the men drink and dance in my place...
...and some of them lose their money...
...but at least they get something in return.
Fun, excitement...
...and a couple of hours of diversion.
And a headache and an empty pocketbook the next morning.
I was just going to pick up my slippers, and there it was.
- She might have been bitten.
- Or any of us.
I don't know why I ever came to this horrible place, I'm leaving.
Me, too.
Strange. How could a snake have gotten into that closet?
Is this your idea of fun, excitement, and a little diversion, Mr. Trent?
I told you we're fighting fair, didn't I?
- You can't fight fair and take their side.
- I killed the snake.
It doesn't matter, anyone could've done it.
The men who put the snake in there are still alive.
And you won't shoot them because they're your customers.
I just killed one of your pets, Sam.
- I don't get it.
- Get this.
If anything else happens to the Harvey girls, you'll answer to me.
- You joined up with the petticoats?
- I haven't joined anything.
All I'm saying to you is, lay off.
It's my turn. I'll get the next basket.
Hello.
Hello. I was just passing by and heard your song.
Do you like it?
It's beautiful.
I heard you singing it the other night.
I hoped you were listening.
Deborah.
- I wondered what happened to you.
- I heard the music and...
Susan, this is Mr...
O'Halloran, miss. Terry O'Halloran.
I hope you don't think there's anything wrong.
No. Of course,
I don't think there's anything wrong.
Let's get out of here.
Listen. Wait a minute.
My intentions are honorable.
Honestly, I mean, no fooling!
Miss Bradley.
I'll be along in just a moment.
Quite a run on Harvey girls we're having this morning.
Was there another matrimonial ad in some paper?
Look, miss, we hardly know each other, so suppose we keep it that way.
Just a minute.
I hear you and the Harvey girls are having a little party tonight.
It's a big party.
Don't you think you should stick to dishwashing?
We're minding our own business.
Suppose you stick to your own profession.
Our profession is entertainment, see.
And we don't like competition.
Well, we're amateurs.
Don't tell me you're afraid of us?
Afraid of you?
- Who are you kidding?
- Come on.
- Let me at her.
- Come on.
My arm!
You're tearing my dress.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
Good evening.
- Won't you go in?
- Thank you.
Now, for the pièce de résistance!
Folks, we'll teach you a brand-new dance.
It's the first dance where a fellow puts his arm around the lady's waist.
It's a brand-new dance that's all the rage way back East...
...in Kansas City.
All right, girls, line up and demonstrate the waltz.
That's very good, girls.
Now, get yourselves partners.
Come on, boys. Join in.
Let's all have a good time.
- Come on. Let's have a good time.
- I tell you, I can't do it, so help me, ma'am.
Anybody want our tickets?
I'll go, Miss Bliss.
- I'll take your tickets.
- It's our turn to go slumming.
Thank you.
All right, folks.
Step lively now, and everybody choose your partners for the waltz.
Well, go ahead, ladies, choose your partners.
I'll bet you're glad to see me, Bucky-boy.
See you later. I'm already took.
- Hello, mister. Dancing?
- Yes, ma'am. I'd be right...
I'm sure he'd like to, but you see, he has a very bad leg.
Well, maybe some other time.
Well, Miss Cassidy, I ain't got no bad leg.
You have now.
- Now you're acting more like a man, Ned.
- I feel better myself.
Quite a little contest we're having.
Last year, if you didn't like somebody, you settled it with your fists or a gun.
- Now we dance it out, don't we?
- We're doing all right, I'm proud of us.
- All right, girls, we don't belong here.
- Let's go where we do belong.
Any of you gentlemen like to join us?
- How about you, Sam?
- It would be a pleasure, Ned.
Any of you gentlemen care for a little recreation?
Miss Bradley, something wonderful has happened.
Look at that.
Do you realize what's going on?
That's mighty fine, Reverend Claggett.
- It's wonderful.
- Yes.
It's more than that.
On this night, the male population of Sandrock, for the first time...
...turned down a wild time in favor of a good time.
Did you lose something, Mr. Trent?
Yes. I lost a fight, Miss Bradley.
The gingham curtains and the flower pots get the decision.
You mean you're giving up?
Not exactly.
There's a mining town, Flagstaff, about 100 miles from here.
That's where Alhambra's planning to move.
When?
Tomorrow morning, the breakfast train.
Is that what you came up here to tell me?
Yes.
What do you expect me to say?
I don't know.
I guess I hoped you'd be glad.
It might make it easier for me to leave.
All right then, I'm glad.
I only wish you'd left a long time ago.
So do I.
Maybe it wouldn't have happened then.
- What?
- Meeting you.
Yes, that was bad, wasn't it?
Two people as far apart as we are.
Yes.
Now, for the first time in my life,
I've got things to remember.
I take it that you don't like memories,
Mr. Trent.
They don't pay off.
They keep you awake nights.
Will you be awake many nights, Ned?
Every night.
I'll be wondering if I should've stayed.
Well, you couldn't.
If you did, it wouldn't make any difference, you'd be giving in to me.
A thing like this can't be one-sided.
We'd both have to give in.
Both of us together.
Where would that put us?
No place in this world...
...because it just can't be done.
Goodbye, Susan.
Can't leave you alone for a minute, can I?
Now, put out that fire.
- Sam, I won't let you do this.
- You're not? We'll see.
We're going to the Alhambra to have a little talk.
Go ahead.
This way, ladies and gentlemen.
Temporary quarters across the street.
Ample notice will be given before the departure of the train.
Right across the street.
Temporary quarters across the street.
Trust me, after this town,
Flagstaff will be a pleasure.
Do you want some sugar?
Em, I'll see you on the train.
All aboard!
- Where are you going, Ned?
- I don't know myself.
- Well, come on inside.
- Leave me alone. I've got to think.
You can think inside.
I'm sorry, Em...
...but I'm afraid my traveling days are over.
Divvy this up with the girls and say goodbye to them for me.
All right. Stay in Sandrock.
And thanks.
Thanks for nothing.
Goodbye.
- What happened to Trent?
- I gave him his walking papers.
Em, do you mean what you're not saying?
Every word of it.
I'll buy San Francisco and put it around your wrist like a bracelet.
I'll put it in your hair like a crown.
I've got a present for the girls in the next car.
Well, greetings from the Atchison,
Topeka and the Santa Fe.
Hello.
I bet we're going 40 miles an hour.
We're getting further and further away from Sandrock every second.
Yes, I guess so.
We should be in Flagstaff in a couple of hours.
Are you planning to stop there by the way?
I'll stop there if he does.
He?
Who?
Ned Trent.
What are you going to do in Flagstaff, wait on tables?
I don't know, but I will if he wants me to.
Look, would you accept an apology?
I'm afraid that maybe I was wrong.
I mean, you see,
I'm from a little town in Ohio.
I probably acted like a snob about girls like you.
I mean, what I thought girls like you were like.
And after all, it's only a matter of style, isn't it?
I mean, some people wear one kind of dress...
...other people wear another.
And this certainly is the barren...
...blistered end of creation out here.
I don't know.
Maybe it's good for the men to have a little entertainment.
You mean you want to join us girls?
I'd like to try.
You'd do that for him?
Well, that's what he wants, isn't it?
- What?
- You're getting off this train.
- No, I'm going to Flagstaff.
- You are.
No, please, don't.
I don't want to get off.
I'll go where he goes.
- He's not on this train. Look.
- What's the matter?
Thank you, Em.
Goodbye, Susan.
Goodbye.

Doc Holiday just got off the stagecoach.
- Want me and the boys to come along?
- Why do you ask that?
Well, I certainly wouldn't want to fool around with him alone.
I don't blame ya, but I'm not gonna make any trouble for Doc Holiday.
He's my best friend.
As long as I'm sheriff around here the place is his.
Hi. Where's Doc Holiday?
In here, Pat.
Hi, Pat.
Gosh, I'm glad to see you.
Doc, how are you?
You're looking plenty sassy.
You wintered kind of fat, didn't you?
- What are you doing over this way?
- I wanted to have a talk with you.
The other is, have you seen anything of a little strawberry roan?
- Somebody steal your horse?
- Yeah.
Cutest little fellow you ever saw.
Mean as mean, but I'd dote on him like he was pure rock candy.
- What are you laughing at?
- Joke's on whoever done it.
First time I ever felt sorry for a horse thief.
- Did you hear he was headed this way?
- Yeah.
Put that on the table in there.
What are you gonna have?
I started with rye.
I don't see no cause to change.
- Where you been keeping yourself?
- Mostly across the border.
That's what I want to see you about.
I need a little money and I thought you might want to come in with me.
- What's the matter?
- I'll let you have the money... but if the deal is like that last one of yours, better not tell me about it.
Why not?
- Where'd you get that thing?
- They stuck it on me little while ago.
You're the last man I ever thought would be so easily satisfied.
Man's gotta settle down sometime.
Mike, did you see anything of a strange strawberry roan?
About 13 hands high and as cute as bug's ear.
Seems to me I did see one about that size.
- When I came on duty.
- Where?
- Up in front of the dentist place.
- Where's that?
I'll show you.
I'm only gonna tell you once more.
You put that glass... on top of your head.
But what are you gonna do then?
Just put it up on your head.
I'll show you.
Best thing in the world for that dandruff of yours.
Wait a minute, Doc.
Hello, Fred.
Hello, Pat.
You're still using that one, huh?
My old standby.
Never has failed yet.
How many fingers do you see, Fred?
I guess I better take Fred to the jail and let him sober up there.
You go ahead. The dentist's place is up the street near the corner.
I'll be along in a minute.
Well, Red, how ya feelin'?
Hello.
- Nice little horse you got here.
- I think so.
- Where'd you get him?
- Bought him in Santa Fe Springs. Why?
Somebody stole him from me in Sacora.
If it wasn't for those two guns,
I'd say you was hiding in pretty young.
- You think it was me?
- You haven't told me any different.
I ain't going to.
My name's Holiday.
Doc Holiday?
- I've heard of you.
- Thanks.
I don't want to take advantage of you.
Thanks. I thought it'd be the other way around.
What's your name, son?
Bonny. William Bonny.
- Billy the Kid, huh?
- Still think I stole your horse?
- How much did you pay for him?
- Wouldn't do any good if I told you.
- Why not?
- I like the horse and got used to him.
- So have I.
- I don't blame you.
- Just like sitting in a rocking chair.
- Now look...
- Hear you're pretty good.
- That's what I hear about you.
All right. You mind standing away from the front of that horse?
Pretty sure of yourself, aren't you?
No sense in going to all this trouble for nothing.
That's right.
Hello, Doc.
Had any luck?
- Yes and no.
- It's your horse, ain't it?
It was.
You're a cool one.
Better get you over to the hoosegow before this gets around.
Come along. Thanks, Doc, for being so forbearing.
All right.
See why I left off?
He's just a kid.
I told you to come along.
Didn't you hear what I said?
I heard you.
You're not doing any better than I did.
Wait a minute. I'd like to make you acquainted with this young man.
Billy, this is an old friend of mine, Pat Garrett.
Pat, this is Mr. William Bonny.
I've been wanting to meet you for a long time.
How are you, Billy?
How many fingers do you see?
You ought to use that only on friends.
While you two are talking I better put my horse away. Back up, boy.
- Why you...
- Hold it. Don't fly off the handle.
Nice little horse, ain't he, Doc?
- Remember me?
- Where's Mr. Garrett?
I sent him home. How 'bout you and me having a little talk?
I don't believe in talk, unless the other fella holds all the cards.
Sonny, that head of yours sure is screwed on tight.
If it wasn't, somebody would have knocked it off long ago.
I guess that's right. How did you know
Pat was gonna hit you out there?
Well, it's the first time a sheriff ever wanted to shake hands with me.
- He heard you say "shake hands."
- Huh?
How do you do, Mr. Horse?
I'm pleased to meet you.
I'll swear, I didn't know he could do tricks.
What else can he do?
You back up there and I'll make him take those gloves right out of your belt.
Over that way a little.
Now back a little farther.
That's far enough, kid.
Put your hands up.
All right, Doc.
- This is new for you, ain't it?
- What?
Bein' arrested for horse stealin'.
Doc, you know I didn't steal that horse any more than you did.
Billy, many a true word is spoken in jest.
This is something new for you too, isn't it, Doc?
Yeah, what's that?
The Great Doc Holiday getting someone else to help him.
And a policeman at that.
I can hardly believe it.
And after the way I've heard people talk about you... ever since I was in short pants.
That's enough of that.
Turn around.
- Now walk out that door.
- Wait a minute.
Why?
Well, this thing don't seem to sit right on my stomach, no how.
What?
Doc, you're not gonna back out on me?
I'm afraid I am.
I'd never hear the end of this.
Hold on!
I'm not through with you yet.
Step aside, Doc.
He may shoot me in the back.
They tell me that's the way you've given it to some of the boys.
Now, Pat, that's a pretty strong thing to say.
I never heard that.
Well, Mr. Garrett, if you believe that... here's your chance to do the same to me.
Coming, Doc?
I think I will.
I want the two of you out of this town by sundown.
What did I do?
That's all right, Doc.
You've got the right to choose your friends.
Shucks. I don't take kindly to that at all.
He knows there's no stage until tomorrow... and he knows that I'm afoot.
Or am I?
- Not by a darn sight.
- You mean that, son?
Sure. We'll dig you up another horse somewhere.
- I guess that's enough for me.
- Cleaned out?
Not quite.
- Where you stoppin', son?
- I got a room at the hotel.
Doc, could I see you a minute?
Sure. You might as well cash me in.
All right.
What's on your mind, son?
No offense, Doc, but that last ace you just drew...
What about it?
I got a feeling I saw it on the bottom of the deck.
- Are you sure?
- Wouldn't have asked if I was.
That's where you showed good sense.
Here you are, Doc... 640.
Thanks.
You could have paid four times for the horse and still saved money.
That's right.
Hope you're satisfied now.
- You gonna turn in?
- I think I will.
I'll walk down to the hotel with you.
Good night, gents, and thanks.
Good night.
If you're not already fixed up, you can bunk with me tonight.
No thanks, Billy.
I've got a girl. She and her aunt just moved into town.
You got a girl?
I ain't got nothin', except that horse.
You can't fool me. A good-looking boy like you must have a girl somewhere.
No. I don't trust 'em.
You're pretty young to talk like that.
Well, I've known quite a few.
And they all did you dirty, eh, every one of them?
Yeah, every one of 'em.
That's too bad, Billy.
I guess things haven't been so easy for you, have they?
Tell you what I'm going to do.
Since that horse means so much to you,
I'm going to make you a present of him.
That's awful nice of you.
Thanks a lot.
All right. Good night.
See you in the morning.
Good night.
Just thought I'd say good night to the horse.
If you're all through, you might as well put him back in his stall.
All right.
Good night, Red.
See you tomorrow.
What, no kiss?
He don't like mush.
Back in your stall, Red.
- That's my tobacco, isn't it?
- I think it is.
You don't mind if I take that, do you?
Red, I think I'll bunk right here tonight, if you don't object.
Say, what is this anyway?
What are you shooting at me for?
Are you crazy?
Stop it.
Cut it out, do you hear?
Can you understand English?
What's your name?
- Rio.
- What's the rest of it?
McDonald.
Where'd you come from?
What do you care?
- Where'd you live before you came here?
- Sacora.
Oh, yeah. Who was he?
My brother.
He shouldn't have taken so much tequila.
- What became of the girl?
- She married a guy two weeks later.
Well, that's the way it is.
How'd I know he was your brother?
It was him or me.
And I didn't lay for him in no barn neither.
- I'm sorry I was so rough with you.
- You didn't hurt me.
You sure?
- It's too bad I didn't know.
- What?
- He was your brother.
- What's that got to do with it?
Well, maybe I wouldn't have tried so hard to get the other girl.
Oh, you wouldn't.
What's the matter?
- There's a rock under here.
- Let me fix it.
Let me go!
Hold still, lady, or you won't have much dress left.
Let me go!
- He did not.
- I say he did.
- Did you really hear him holler?
- Sure I did.
- So did I.
- Then that ain't Billy the Kid.
Shucks, a dentist can make anybody holler.
Look out.
Here he comes.
- Sorry to keep you waiting, Doc.
- I'm in no hurry.
- You're the Billy the Kid?
- That's what they tell me.
- See, what did I tell you?
- Wait. One at a time.
Have you really got
20 notches in your gun?
Is it true you got 13 Indian scalps in your war bag?
Had to throw 'em away.
The moths got to them.
Tanning 'em the best way to keep them.
- Is that a fact?
- That's what my pa told me.
- What are you doing with that?
- Trying get bark off to make a whistle.
- Have you sucked it?
- I sucked it till it near dry.
Can't you shoot the insides out?
- Put it up on that post.
- Can't I hold it?
- Can you hold it steady?
- Sure!
Billy, you don't have to prove anything to me.
It's all right.
Turn the end up a little.
Little more.
You hit it!
- Don't you take aim?
- I took aim.
- When?
- Before I drew.
Look, Billy, it's all right.
You fixed it fine. Thanks.
- Glad to help.
- Anything I can do, let me know.
- That's a new one on me.
- What?
Aiming before you draw.
- I've got to.
- Why?
My hand seems to be a little quicker than my eye.
Well, ain't that too bad.
- Where'd you get the horse?
- I bought this one.
- Looks all right.
- He'll do for the time being.
Ham and eggs.
Fry the eggs on both sides.
I'll take the same.
Mine straight up.
How 'bout a cold hand while we're waiting?
How much?
- How's that?
- Suits me.
Before you get started
I'd like to speak to you for a minute.
- Who is he?
- I don't know.
- What do you want?
- Let's go in the backroom.
Why?
You don't know me, but we have a mutual friend.
Who?
And I don't like him any better than you do.
Oh, Garrett, eh?
The name sounds familiar.
- Figure on staying in town tonight?
- Why?
Everybody knows that Garrett told you to get out of town.
Sooner or later you're gonna have a little trouble with him.
I thought I might give you a hand.
That's very kind of you, mister.
Listen. I ain't doing you no favor.
It'll be a pleasure.
Now what I figure is when he's arguing with you, he won't watch anyone else.
So, it'll be a cinch for me.
Be careful you don't knock me over with the same bullet.
Don't worry.
I'll stand at an angle.
I'll do it like this.
Suppose this chair is Garrett there.
And if you're standing about where you are... why, I'll be over here.
Do you mind if I draw my gun so you can see the line of fire?
No, go right ahead.
- It's me, Billy.
- Come on in, Doc.
- What happened?
- He's a pretty smart hombre.
You know him?
He's been hanging around trying to talk
Garrett into making him a deputy.
I guess he figured if he got Billy he'd be a hero... he could have the deputy job, or run for governor if he wanted it.
- Better get out of here, son.
- Why? He pulled on me first.
- Be hard to make Garrett believe that.
- We'll see.
Where's my dough?
Well, I guess I must've picked it up.
You're foolish to stick around, son.
I think I'd be more foolish to pull out.
Then Garrett would be sure that was my fault.
Come on. Cut for deal.
- You meant you want to play poker.
- That's right.
You're not worried about me if I tangle with Garrett, are you?
Fights pretty good.
I know him better than you do.
All right, if he's so good... then you'll get your horse back, won't you?
Say, I never thought of that.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
- Lend me a hundred.
- I never lend money in a poker game.
Spoils my luck.
But I'd be glad to have you put up the horse for a hundred.
I guess you would.
Hello, Pat.
Care for a bite to eat, boys?
A little hand of poker?
No thanks, Doc.
Were you in there when it happened?
No. But listen, Pat, he pulled on Billy first.
- How do you know?
- His gun was on the floor.
That don't prove nothing.
Pat, you've got an ugly temper and you're letting it get the best of you.
You have no right to hold Billy for this killing, and you know it.
You're just sore at him, that's all.
Doc, I'm gonna give you a chance to stay out of this.
- Thanks.
- Your horse is outside. Get on him.
- Good luck to you.
- Same to you.
What are you waitin' for?
He's waiting for those chickens of yours to hatch.
Are you gonna put up a fight?
I'll tell you one thing.
I ain't going to jail for no killing I was pushed into.
- Thanks, Doc.
- What are you trying to do?
I still think that fella pulled first on Billy.
Are you throwing off on me again?
Then what do you call it?
Since I figure that this is a personal matter between you and Billy...
I don't think you ought to bring in all this hired help.
I only did that to keep Billy from putting up a fight... so I wouldn't have to kill him.
Do you stuff birds too?
You're making a big mistake... turning on an old friend, all because of a little snip... who's never given anybody nothing except the back of his hand.
Speaking of hands...
Come on. Let's get out of here before this hothead makes us plug him.
He ain't gonna run me out of town.
If you wanna hold the fort while
I ride off on your little horse... it's all right with me.
Well, since you put it that way.
Go ahead, son.
Take it easy, Pat.
Doc, this finishes you and me for good and all.
I'm sorry.
- Can you get up, son?
- I don't know.
- Can you make it to the horse?
- I think so.
Did you see what that little horse did, pulling me out like that?
He's a regular bird dog.
I gotta get you under cover some place.
I'm all right.
Charlie, you better stay here and have a look around town.
That kid's got a bullet in him.
He ain't going far. Let's go.
Who's that?
Quit that yelling.
Get these horses out of sight.
This is Billy the Kid.
He got a bad one on the left side... but the bullet didn't hit anything vital and it came out in the back.
Don't move him at all or the bleeding will start again.
I guess you better cut his clothes off.
Put a bandage on the wound and see that it's always moist.
Keep him warm and dry.
If he gets a chill, he's a goner.
If he goes out of his head, tie him down.
The neighbors hear him yelling, tell them your aunt has smallpox.
That'll keep them away.
I guess that's all.
Now do your best for this boy.
If I can't come back,
I'll send word where I am.
And Billy can bring you along.
Shoo, shoo!
Face like a baby.
He's so hot.
He's no hotter than your brother Julio was.
He's soaking wet again.
Get me some sheets,
Aunt Guadalupe.
Get them yourself.
- What's the matter with you?
- I wouldn't lift a finger for him.
What's the matter?
- Been lookin' for him around here.
- Well, ain't that too bad.
Chico, what's the matter with you?
He smells the blood.
He was just getting ready to peck his eyes out.
You stay out of here.
- Your name McDonald?
- What do you wanna know for?
Why don't you wanna tell me?
- Yes, that's my name. Why?
- Your father's name is...
Woodruff. Charlie Woodruff.
I used to work for him when he was Tom Motsacoro.
Oh, yes. I guess I was a little girl then.
- Charlie!
- Aunt Guadalupe!
- How you been?
- Very well. Thank you.
You're getting fat as a pig.
- What are you doing up here?
- I've been working with the sheriff.
We're looking for Billy the Kid.
You get out of here!
- Come in and sit down.
- Some other time.
I'll drop in the first chance I get.
- What's wrong with that bird?
- Nothing.
I have a hen sitting under the bed and he likes to peck at her.
- Want me to get him out of there?
- No. Everything's all upset in there.
We just got up.
Good-bye. I'm glad to have seen you.
Same here.
So long, Aunt Guadalupe.
- I'll walk down a ways with you.
- No, you won't. Lunch is all ready.
Good-bye.
I'll fix you.
How's Billy?
Looks like he's having a chill.
A chill?
Where are you?
Right here.
- Don't go away.
- I won't.
- I'm so cold.
- I'll get you warm.
- Don't go away.
- I'll only be a minute.
How can you stop a thing like this?
- You're mad at me.
- No.
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.
- Why do you hide from me?
- I'll be right back.
- Where's that bottle of whiskey?
- I finished it.
The time I had that bad cough.
I fired those hot stones for Julio, but it was just the same.
He shook like a leaf till he died.
You get out of here and shut the door.
What?
Just get out of here.
Have you gone crazy?
You can bring the minister tomorrow if it'll make you feel better about it.
Now get out.
You're not gonna die.
I'll get you warm.
Well, Red, you can't stand this pace much longer.
I guess I'll just have to slow those boys down a little.
None of my affair, but we crossed the county line ten minutes ago.
That's right, Swanson.
It's none of your affair.
Break up!
Scatter for those rocks!
You look different today.
You look better.
Say, is that you?
What are you doing here?
I live here.
Well, I've been trying to figure this out.
- How'd I get here?
- Doc brought you.
Oh. Are you Doc's girl?
What do you know about that.
Be careful your wound.
You'll hurt yourself.
That's right. I remember now.
- I caught one yesterday, didn't I?
- Yesterday?
It was a month ago.
You've been terribly sick.
A month? That's a long time.
- How's Red?
- Red?
- Have you been takin' good care of him?
- Who's Red?
Didn't Doc leave my horse here?
Well, I'll swear. I didn't think he'd do a thing like that.
Behind my back too.
Is he all right again?
Say, who's this old lollipop?
It's my Aunt Guadalupe.
¿Qué tal? ¿Cómo está?
You haven't got a ham sandwich on you?
You hungry? I don't think we have anything cooked beside some beans.
That'll do for a starter, eh, lollipop?
Say, you don't talk like a sick man.
Who said I was?
What does that "lollipop" mean?
Oh, something sweet.
Sweet?
Sweet, like candy.
You know, dulce.
Is that a fact?
Where are you going?
Oh, to see if I can find a fresh egg or two.
- How do you feel?
- Fine. When do we eat?
- You just had lunch about an hour ago.
- Honest?
Will you bring me my clothes?
I want to have a look around.
What for?
I can't spend the rest of my life in bed.
Anyway, I want to see if I can find my ring.
Your ring?
Yeah. I had a ring on this finger and it's gone.
I've been worried about it.
You mustn't be upset about a thing like that.
You can get another one, can't you?
This one's been kind of lucky for me.
It belonged to a fellow who was supposed to have had a charmed life... as long as he kept it on his finger.
Then how did you get it?
Did you kill him?
No. Somebody else did that.
Then the ring wasn't so lucky for him after all, was it?
Well, nothing happened to him until he took it off to wash his hands.
No, you better not get up till tomorrow.
- You said that yesterday.
- You're not strong enough yet.
Who says I'm not?
Billy, you mustn't.
You'll hurt yourself.
Then why don't you quit wrestling with me?
But you've been so sick.
You're not well enough. You're not...
Rio!
Come on. I want you to go down to the store with me.
I have some washing to do.
You've got all afternoon to do it.
Come on.
- I have to fix my hair first.
- All right, hurry up then.
- Why do you have to go with her?
- I better.
What if somebody should come by... like that deputy sheriff friend of yours the other day?
Yes, that's right.
I'll go tell Aunt Guadalupe.
- Who is it?
- It's me, Doc.
Hurry up!
Open this door here.
Coming.
Hello, Doc.
Glad to see you, Doc!
You'd never know it. I thought
I'd have to break the door down.
It's the rain, Doc.
I couldn't hear a thing, Doc.
You don't need to yell so loud.
I'm not deaf.
Did you ever see such a storm, and it's been going on for four days?
It was lucky for me. The only way
I could shake those bloodhounds.
Washed out all your tracks, huh?
Hungry?
First sit down I've had since I left here.
How's Billy?
Oh, he's fine, sure.
He's been up almost a week now.
Good.
Where's Rio?
So that's what all the yellings about, eh?
- I'll go and call her for you.
- Wait a minute.
You made enough noise now to raise the dead.
So that's it?
All right, where is he?
He's getting dressed.
Maybe I better give him a hand.
No, Doc! Please let me talk to you first!
What got into you? Were you drunk?
What happened to you?
I don't know.
He's a devil.
He did the same to me.
He can charm a bird right out of a bush.
- I never saw it to fail.
- Don't talk that way.
What do you want me to say... bless you, my children?
You might as well.
Huh?
I'm married to him.
You're what?
That's the truth, Doc.
Only please don't tell him.
Tell who?
Billy.
- You mean he doesn't know it?
- No.
Then how could you be married to him?
He was out of his mind.
I never would have done it, only I thought he was gonna die.
And so he would have, if it hadn't been for you.
I don't want his gratitude.
Guess I should've stayed out in the rain with the sheriff.
- Make me a cup of coffee.
- Sure.
It's a good thing you don't want his gratitude.
Why do you say that?
You know, when I come to think of it... after what you done to me,
I couldn't wish you anything better... than you hooking up with Billy.
What do you mean?
I wouldn't want to spoil it for you.
Hello, Doc.
Is that all you got to say to me?
Now look here, Doc, I'm sorry, but it's your own fault.
Oh, my fault, huh?
Who brought me here?
Now you want to switch the blame on me.
First you take my horse, then my girl... and both times it's all my fault.
That reminds me of something else.
You ran away with Red, didn't you?
You think that's any excuse?
It was good enough for me.
- There's only one trouble with it.
- What's that?
The horse was mine too.
I wasn't in much shape to argue that with you, was I?
No, I guess you weren't.
But you didn't have use for that horse lying flat on your back, or did you?
All right, Doc, if that's your way of looking at it.
You just took the loan of him, so to speak.
What are you getting at?
Yes, that's what
I'd like to know.
You borrow from me...
I borrow from you.
What does that mean?
Let's have a cup of java.
We better be getting out of here.
Not at those prices.
All right, Doc,
I'll tell you what I'll do.
What's that?
Well, just to show you my heart's in the right place...
I'll let you take your pick.
Huh?
You mean you'd trade me for a horse?
It's up to Doc. After all, I've got to think of the other fellow, you know.
I appreciate that.
I sure do.
Billy, you don't mean that.
And after all she did for you.
Say, you should have seen what that little horse did for me, huh, Doc?
That's right.
I hope you won't think too hard of me... but under the circumstances...
I'm going to take the horse.
- You are?
- You're not satisfied?
Listen, Doc,
I like that little horse.
What'd I tell you, huh?
- I still can't believe it.
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing.
- What's eating you?
Nothing!
Here. Fill these with fresh water.
The creeks are muddy as all get out.
How about grub?
Can you spare enough flour and bacon to get us to Fort Sumner?
Sure.
Hey, it's clearing up.
We better be getting out of here.
Lend me some dough, will you?
How much do you want?
About 50 bucks.
Here's 40.
Here.
Buy yourself a horse and buggy.
Don't you think it's too much?
You can give Aunt Guadalupe 20 if you want.
If we get located in Fort Sumner,
I'll send for you.
What for?
I can't stand ranch cooking.
Here you are.
- Thanks. Good-bye.
- Bye, Doc.
Bye, lollipop.
Bye, Billy.
Take care of yourself.
You do the same.
Fill these up for Doc.
Hello, you old hay bag.
Have ya missed me?
He's thin as a rail.
He's been getting a little exercise.
Where'd you get that plug?
Wore out the black horse I had, so I traded him to sheep herder for this one.
He's all right.
Little wild yet.
Come on.
Ain't Red a sweetheart?
I'm going to let you have a loan of him for a little while.
- Until you get your strength back.
- You're not gonna do me any favors.
- What's the matter with you?
- I don't wanna be obligated about Red.
- Why not?
- I'm not giving up on getting him back... anymore than I've given up getting on this ornery goat.
Bye, Rio.
- What's the matter?
- Boy, am I tuckered.
- What are you lookin' for?
- A sink of tobacco.
Say, is there anything of mine you don't cotton to?
- I guess I forgot.
- Yeah, it's a bad habit you got.
- What?
- Forgettin' what belongs to others.
- You think I did it on purpose?
- Yes.
- Listen, I don't feel good as it is.
- Neither do I.
You wanna make something out of it?
- That's a big advantage you're taking.
- I can't help it.
I'm so plumb beat out,
I'll be lucky if I can draw 'em clear.
I don't want to crowd a sick man.
I'm all right. Just give me 40 winks and I'll take ya with both hands free.
I guess this is as good a place as any to make camp.
There's no water.
And you won't find any between here and Fort Sumner.
That's a long ways off.
When we get there our friend, the sheriff, won't be far behind.
Huh?
Garrett?
How do you know it's him?
I can tell him farther off than that.
He wouldn't be coming after the two of us alone.
Maybe he's lost too many of his friends.
How come you didn't knock him over?
Or did you try?
- Did I?
- That's what I said. Did ya?
Didn't do nothin' else.
Who do you suppose put him on our trail?
Well, maybe somebody saw us pulling out or...
Or what?
Nothing.
- Sure, she was the one.
- Yeah, Rio.
Why do you suppose she had to up and do a thing like that?
Well, women are funny.
Go easy on that water. We've only got two canteens to get us to Fort Sumner.
What's the matter?
Look!
Sweet spirited miter.
The little darling put sand in it instead of water.
That sure is one for the book.
Well, no use hanging 'round here till morning. Let's get going.
You know, Doc, I think
I'll have another drink.
What are you talking about?
You didn't have one in the first place.
No, but I had the same notion about an hour ago.
I know what you're thinking, but it won't do you any good.
- Take my advice.
- What?
Killing a woman.
- Why not?
- They're all alike.
There isn't anything they wouldn't do for you... or to you.
Hey, why didn't you wake me up?
We should've gotten started long ago.
Keep 'em up!
Hello, Pat.
- Where's Billy?
- Looks like he left ya.
And on my horse, eh?
Try those on.
You know me.
Do I have to put these on?
I know ya.
Put 'em on!
That was pretty smart, putting sand in those canteens.
I had to give you something for your money, didn't I?
Oh, I see.
So you sent the sheriff after us for good measure, huh?
No wonder he came alone.
All he had to do was take his time and wait for the sun to finish us off.
Then how did you get back?
It was pretty tough... but the more I thought about seeing you, darling... the easier it got.
Then what are you waiting for?
Go ahead.
Say, that sounds real nice.
I like to hear you ask for it.
Keep it up.
Beg some more.
What would you like me to say?
Well, you might say "please" very sweetly.
Please.
Will you keep your eyes open?
Yes.
Will you look right at me while I do it?
What is it?
Everybody drinks but me.
I'm supposed to be a camel, huh?
You want a drink, you can climb down and get it.
Say, did you hear something?
- What kind of a track is that?
- I don't know.
Too small for a man.
Here's another one.
Couple over there.
Well, take a look at that.
Yeah, it's an old Indian trick soaking rawhide in water to make it shrink.
Another hour, she'd have been hanging by her wrists.
Well, I'll say one thing for Billy.
He sure does pay off poetic.
He put her right where she could see the water.
He just left here less than half an hour ago.
He went that way, toward those mountains.
- Are you all right? Sit.
- Don't worry about me. Go after him.
- We can't catch him now.
- Why not?
He's got too much of a head start on us. Sit down.
You know, I think he's in love with you.
What are you talking about?
The crazier a man is about a woman, the crazier he thinks and does.
He's only crazy about one thing: Himself.
Say, that gives me a thought.
Maybe we'll get Mr. Billy after all.
- How?
- Just like he says.
If he's crazy enough to do you like this... maybe he's just crazy enough to come back to turn you loose.
You're the one that's crazy.
He doesn't care anything about me.
He'd never come back.
Maybe so, but it's worth trying.
Ain't it, Doc?
If he's fool enough to come back, he oughta get himself caught.
I told you not to breathe so loud.
All right, all right.
Well, how do you like it?
I thought I tied it tighter than that.
- You came back.
- Not on your account, I didn't.
- You didn't?
- You see Doc and the sheriff?
Here we are, Billy, right behind ya.
Now put those hands where they belong.
Say, why didn't you tip me off?
Hurry up with that grub.
I wanna get to town before dark.
- Well, I've only got two hands.
- Why don't you use both of 'em?
- I'll use one on you in a minute.
- I wouldn't put it past ya.
Now's your chance with me all trussed up like a chicken.
Here we are together again.
Same old happy family.
Yeah, and I'd have been halfway to
Fort Sumner if it hadn't been for you.
- Me?
- Yeah, you.
Give me a cigarette.
- You mean her.
- Rio! Are you out of your mind?
- Come out and admit it like a man.
- Admit what?
You didn't know Pat caught me until you got back to our camp, did ya?
- Then why come after us?
- Why not?
We'd have been clear to Lincoln before you even got back here.
Say, mister, what are you trying to make out?
I heard you say once you didn't like ranch cooking... so I guess you figured you'd better come back and get Rio.
You're daffy. I wouldn't come back two inches to get her.
- You did.
- I tell you I didn't.
- Actions speak louder than words.
- Do they?
I'll show you how much
I care about her.
If you want her back, you can have her.
Now what do you think about that?
I don't want her.
- Cattle don't graze after sheep.
- Sheep?
Sheep did you say?
I didn't say goats or monkeys.
Why you.
Ah, sit down.
- What's the matter with you?
- None of your business!
Careful, young fella.
You want it now?
I've just been waitin' for an excuse like this.
I'll fix you up.
Never mind fixin' any more food.
We're leavin' now. Come on.
Let me get a drink first.
All right, hurry up.
Hey, Rio, come here and hold my hands so I won't fall in.
Come out of there!
You're all right now.
Come on.
You figure on taking us back to Lincoln, ain't ya?
Where did ya think
I was takin' ya?
- It's over that way, ain't it?
- Sure. What are you gettin' at?
Take a look.
Hey, Doc.
Well, the Mescaleros are out early this year.
They're talkin' about us, ain't they?
Yeah. They're tippin' off another hunting party that must be out.
Right over there.
On both sides of us.
I guess our best chance is to hightail it to Fort Sumner.
Don't figure on me doing much hightailing.
- Why not?
- I ain't no acrobat.
I hope you fellas have sense enough to behave yourselves.
Sure, Pat, certainly.
Sure, Pat.
No, ya don't!
- That's your horse over there.
- Who says so?
I say so.
Get on him and hurry up.
Rio, you ride the paint.
Thanks.
Hey, Red's my horse.
I know he is, but I'm gonna ride him.
I don't like this.
Looks like some of those Mescaleros are ahead of us too.
No, you better not come over here, Rio.
- Why not?
- They put the fire on them.
Those Mescaleros sure do play for keeps.
Say, what's that?
It's a good size party. We'll be knee-deep in them in a minute.
Look over there too.
- Hey, what are ya doin'?
- What do ya think? I want my gun.
Now wait a minute.
You're not gonna argue at a time like this. Aren't you gonna give us a chance?
He'd like to see them put the fire on me.
- I sure would.
- What about her?
We can't talk about it now.
I want to know one thing.
Do I have your solemn promise that you'll give them back when I ask?
- Sure. What do you think we are?
- Will you see to it that he does?
Who's gonna see to it that I do?
I'll take your word for it.
- Where are my cartridges?
- Here you are.
Now what do we do?
Make a stand or run for it?
- Can't make a stand here.
- I know something that might work.
- What is it?
- Come on. Do exactly what I do.
Cut him loose!
I know this place. We're about
40 miles from Fort Sumner.
Senor Garrett, what are you doing out this late?
Hello, Pablo.
Can you put us up for the night?
Sure, glad to have you. Come right in.
My house is yours.
I'll take care of the horses.
Well, boys, I guess we're out of the woods now, huh?
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.
I wouldn't be too sure of that, Pat.
Oh, yes, he's right, Pat.
Those Mescaleros don't give up so easy.
This is very important.
I want you to ride to Fort Sumner... and give this note to the town marshal.
Did he say "town marshal"?
That's what it sounded like to me.
Thanks, Rio.
It certainly is a beautiful night out.
I think I'll take a little stroll.
And, gentlemen, just in case
I shouldn't return before you retire...
I'll say good night now.
I think I'll go with ya.
Well, Billy, you've been pretty good to my little horse.
I guess the least I can do is let you say good-bye to him.
That's awfully nice of you, Doc.
Oh, I always like to think of the other fella.
So if you just stand right here in this doorway... and don't make no warlike moves... then you can wave farewell to 'im as we ride off.
In other words, you think you're gonna leave.
I'm sorry, Pat, I hate to eat and run, but you know how it is.
- Listen, Doc.
- You're wasting your time, Pat.
Haven't you forgotten something?
No, I don't think so.
Good night all.
Say, Doc.
Yes, what is it?
I'm afraid you'll have to listen to me for a minute.
Why?
What if I don't feel like waving good-bye to Red?
You still think you got something to say about that horse, eh?
Yes, I do.
All right, go ahead and say it.
That's a pretty big advantage to give a man like you.
Didn't you tell me that once?
How's this?
You don't have to go that far.
Thanks.
What about him?
Will he leave us alone?
Or do you think we ought to pull his teeth before we start?
Don't worry about me.
I wouldn't lift a finger, Doc, to keep you from killing him.
You and me never had any trouble till he came along.
He'll keep out of it.
All right, son, I'm waiting.
Put those plates down.
You're makin' me nervous.
- Billy, he'll kill ya.
- What do you care?
- But you can get another horse.
- I want this one.
Why?
I wanna see if I can teach him to make smoke come out of his ears.
Say, I haven't got all night.
Get back against that wall.
- But Billy...
- Go on!
And count up to three.
I won't. You're outta your mind, both of ya.
How about you, Pat?
Sure, I'll be glad to.
You're too willing.
I don't trust you.
I think I'd rather have that cuckoo clock do the counting for me.
Yeah, that's good enough.
It's gonna strike in a minute.
Should we pull on the last cuckoo?
All right.
Well, Billy, I guess this is it.
Men are pretty much like children after all.
Have you ever seen two kids wrestling in the yard?
They push and tussle and maybe they look like they're fighting... but they're not.
They're really friends... and everything's in fun.
Then pretty soon, they play a little too rough... one of 'em gets mad... and in the end, somebody always gets hurt.
So for you and me, this is where somebody gets hurt.
But when it's over... and however it turns out, son... no hard feelings.
Why didn't you draw?
Why did you change your mind?
This some trick of yours?
No, I just don't feel like it.
Maybe I ate too much.
Perhaps some other night you will feel like it, eh?
Who knows?
I never wanted it, but I've waited and let you pick... your own time and place.
You've done that tonight.
You gonna draw, or do I have to make you?
Are you gonna fight... or do you want me to nick your ears?
Doc, have you gone loco?
What's the matter with you, Billy?
I didn't think you'd take this off anybody.
Maybe I wouldn't, off anybody else.
What do you mean by that?
Doc, don't listen to that kind of talk.
Haven't you ever seen cold feet before?
He never had cold feet in his life.
What is it, Billy?
I guess the idea about the cuckoo clock wasn't so good.
Why?
Well, it gave me time to think and remember a few things.
You're the only partner
I ever had.
Gosh, do you really feel that way, son?
- I treated you worse than anyone.
- Nah, it was all my fault.
- Wouldn't want Red carrying both of us.
- Oh, don't worry.
We can find a better way than that to divide 'im up.
Say, you can ride 'im outta here.
No, I had him last.
That's right, come to think of it.
I ain't worried about you and me ever fighting now, Billy... because one thing is certain.
If we didn't do it tonight, we never will.
Come on. Let's go.
So long, Pat.
Don't take any wooden nickels.
You're not going with him.
Look here, you ain't gonna start something with the two of us, are ya?
I might've known you'd do this to me.
Ever since you met him, you've treated me like a dog.
The very first day, you sided with him against me... and made me the laughingstock of the town!
Take it easy.
I gave you your guns so you'd have a chance for your life.
And now you tell me I gotta fight the two of you to get them back.
You stand there, side by side... with that little snip of a kid against me... me, the oldest and best friend you ever had!
And I still would be if it wasn't for him!
Say, mister, that's about enough outta you for one night.
Wait a minute.
You let me handle this.
Pat is a friend of mine.
I don't want to kill him, and
I don't want you to kill him. Clear?
Pat, you're just getting yourself all steamed up.
I'll be seeing you one of these days, and we'll have a good laugh about this.
Now, so long.
Be careful. You know you haven't got a chance against me.
Good-bye.
- Say.
- No, son, please, don't do that.
Oh, Doc, lie down.
Why not?
That's one thing
I've always been afraid of.
- What?
- Dying in bed.
Why didn't you shoot?
You had me beat by a mile.
You had me cold.
Maybe I don't like cold meat.
Well, go ahead.
Go ahead, what?
Aren't you going to say something over Doc?
I don't know what to say.
I never said anything over anybody
I killed before.
I think we oughta say something over Doc.
You better do it.
So long, Doc.
I want you to know I'm sorry.
I honestly am.
Last night I was ready to kill you... but in the daylight,
I can see things much better.
You and Doc have been friends for years.
If I hadn't come between ya, none of this would've happened.
It sure is funny... how two or three trails can cross... and get all tangled up.
Well, go ahead.
After you.
Say, you don't think I'd shoot you in the back, do you?
I don't know, but I ain't gonna tempt ya.
I don't think you'd be fool enough to try to do it from the front.
You never trust anybody, do you?
I apologize, Pat.
Go ahead.
Who's that?
- Where's Pat?
- He's still in the house.
- What's he doin'?
- He's not gonna try to stop you.
- How do you know?
- He told me so.
Say, Billy, can I see you for a minute?
What do you want?
If that's the way ya feel about it, never mind.
At least I'm not afraid to turn my back on you.
Here. Hold these a minute.
I thought you might like to have Doc's guns as a keepsake.
Say, I sure would.
Thanks, Pat.
Thanks a whole lot.
I never had an extra pair.
Black holsters too.
They'd go nice with Sunday clothes, if I ever get any.
Do you think they'll suit ya?
If the barrels ain't too long.
No, they're just the same.
Be careful. They're loaded.
That's right.
I think they're better balanced than mine.
Then how about letting me have yours?
My guns? What for?
If I had your guns...
I could say it was you out there in that grave, instead of Doc.
You'd pass Doc off as me?
Sure.
Everybody would believe me once they saw your six-shooters.
You could leave an end to your trail right here.
Nobody'd follow you up north.
All your troubles would be buried... past and present.
You and Rio could go off with nothing to worry about.
How come you'd do a favor like that for me?
There you go again, Billy.
Distrustin' a person who's tryin' to be decent to you.
Don't you realize that's your whole trouble?
Don't you see that's what's gotten you into all your fights?
You got more enemies than anybody in this part of the country.
How do you expect to get along with people... when you think every man who holds his hand out to you... has a knife behind his back?
Son, l...
I just don't know what's going to become of you.
Honest, I don't.
I didn't mean anything.
I'm sorry.
That's the spirit.
That's my boy.
Now give me those guns and clear out of here, before it's too late.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
But I've had these guns a long time.
I sure hate to let go of 'em.
I've been pretty patient with you.
Billy, my son... it's your duty to give them up.
You owe it to yourself.
You ought to start a new life today.
Those guns are the badge of your shame.
They represent everything you must leave behind you.
Don't you realize that?
Don't you understand... that if you're going to start all over again... your hands must be clean?
I guess you're right, Pat.
I never thought of it like that.
Thanks, Pat.
Billy, you don't know what this means to me.
You'll never forget this day.
Good-bye, Pat.
Why do you say that?
Why shouldn't I?
Why should you?
You ain't goin' anywhere.
I took the firing pins out of those guns.
Why you...
Nothing would make me happier than for you to keep coming.
Is that one of your own guns?
It sure looks like it.
How did you get it?
You dirty little cheat.
You switched those guns on me.
Of all the dirty, rotten tricks...
I didn't mean to, Pat.
Honest, I didn't.
They must've gotten mixed up while I was playin' with 'em.
Thanks.
I left my guns right there.
What for?
Don't you have to show them to everybody to make them believe your story?
You see, I have an idea... that you'd rather give Doc the credit for doing you up like this.
Because I think you'd rather be dead than have people know... that Billy the Kid did this to ya.
Good-bye, Pat.
You don't wanna go off without your canteens, do you?
- Did you fill 'em up for me?
- Yes.
There they come!
Mr. President,
I have the honor to deliver to you the first shipment of gold from California.
Thank you, Captain.
On this auspicious occasion,
I feel compelled to say a few words.
From the soil of this great continent has come a precious metal...
Gold.
The majestic earth of this noble, fertile land, which has given us fuel for our homes in the form of coal from the great mines of Pennsylvania, food in the form of wheat, and corn, and barley.
From the plains of our western frontier...
I'm beginning to see now why you insisted
Caroline spend the weekend in the country.
I'm certain it's for her own good.
I'm certain you're certain, Martin, just as I'm certain you've overlooked the fact she'll be back in town tomorrow night for the White House reception.
What then?
Anything might happen.
It's possible the 4th Cavalry will receive its marching orders before tomorrow night.
Things happen quickly in the War Department these days.
You haven't overlooked a thing, have you?
Not a thing. Shh...

In conclusion I should like to say, our trust has always been in providence.

May the good Lord grant us strength and the fortitude, the foresight and the integrity, the will and the means to exploit this new discovery for the everlasting good of mortal man.
Oh, welcome home,
Lieutenant Latham.
Hello, Alfred.
Things were kind of quiet while you were away.
Well, now that we're back, we'll see if we can't take care of it.
Any changes in the political picture?
We never heard how the elections came out.
Well, Senator McLean was defeated.
We'll be losing him next month.
That's a shame.
Lovely girl, the Senator's daughter.
Talented too.
What about Senator Frost?
- He was returned by a big plurality.
- Is that so?
Yes. Looks like we're gonna have him around for quite a spell.
That's fine.
You know, I remember when Senator Frost first come to Washington,
I said to Martha--
That's my wife.
I said, "He'll be the biggest man in the country," I said.
- Miss McLean.
- Robert.
- Caroline.
- Robert.
Please, Robert. No, not here.
You mustn't.
I imagine you'll find Washington rather dull after the west.
They tell me it's very beautiful.
It is beautiful.
Everywhere I looked you were there.
Oh, Robert...
I mean...
I mean, Lieutenant.
I want to hear all about your trip.
It must be very exciting to meet a man like Jake Carstair.
I've always been interested in the west.
It's so wild and dangerous they say.
Not half as dangerous as you in the moonlight.
The officers and their ladies are having a little celebration tomorrow night at the barracks.
I trust I may have the honor?
Oh, I'd love to, but...
But there's a reception at the White House.
Remember the balcony at the barracks the night I went away?
The President has asked me to sing.
There was no one else in the world that night, just you and I.
My father made me promise I'd attend.
That same moon will be there, waiting, and I'll be waiting too.
Hello, Father.
I as under the impression you were in the country.
I was. I went for a drive in the carriage, and suddenly I realized
I was such a short distance from Washington, I just drove in.
You remember Lieutenant Latham, of course?
Of course, very well.
How do you do, Lieutenant?
How do you do, Senator?
- And my Aunt Cissy?
- It's a pleasure to see you again, ma'am.
Congratulations, sir.
I was very happy to hear of your re-election.
I'm sure you were.
Come, Caroline.
Well, Lieutenant Latham's just been telling me all about the west.
It sounds terribly exciting.
With all the gold in California,
I'm surprised to see you back here.
All the gold is not in California, sir.
Then you plan on being stationed in Washington permanently, Lieutenant?
The plans of a soldier are quite as uncertain as those of a politician, sir.
One never knows.
I hope I shall see you again soon.
Coming, Cecelia?
Yes, Martin.
Good day, Lieutenant.
Tomorrow night.
Will you keep my place in your heart open, Robert?
The political experts say my father will be returned to office next election.
Sarcasm isn't very becoming to you, Jeannie.
You know, the first time I saw you, you were riding in the park, a beautiful white steed.
It was love at first sight.
I'm convinced now it was the horse.
For a diplomat, Martin, you certainly displayed very little tact with Lieutenant Latham.
Stop calling your father Martin.
It's disrespectful.
He loves it.
I don't believe in pretense.
I dislike Lieutenant Latham intensely.
Ha! It's obvious.
He's an opportunist.
He's interested in you solely because I'm in a position to help him further his career.
I think he's charming.
He has...
He has character.
Yes, and it's all bad.
How do you do?
I'm convinced the only reason you like him is because I don't.
How do you do?
You're the most obstinate daughter a man ever had.
She comes from a long line of obstinate people.
- Senator Frost.
- Abe.
I want you to promise me you won't see him again.
I'll promise no such thing.
Now see here, Caroline--
If you ask me, you're only rubbing her the wrong way.
The sooner you forget
Lieutenant Latham, the sooner Caroline will.
You're both wrong.
Well, anyway, with all his conniving, he hasn't been able to quite make himself welcome at the White House.
You shan't see him tomorrow night.
- Tomorrow night?
- The White House reception.
You haven't forgotten you're to sing for the president, have you?
Oh, no, no, I hadn't forgotten.
The President of the United States is expecting you to sing tonight and you're going to sing.
All right, Martin.
I'll go. I'll sing.
She's in no condition to sing, it's ridiculous.
Ridiculous?
It's fantastic.
In all the annals of medical history, no one ever heard of a cold developing so quickly.
Oh, your hand feels so cool.
Why, you are burning up.
Temperature.
She's on fire!
I better send for Dr. Carol.
Oh, no. No, I'll be all right.
You're ill, Caroline.
I just need some sleep.
Run along, both of you.
Why, I wouldn't think of leaving you in this condition.
Cissy, you go on.
Make my apologies to the president.
Nonsense.
You go, I'll stay.
No, no, no.
Please. I--
I don't want anyone to stay.
I-- I'll be much better if I'm just left alone.
Good night.
Have a good time.
Well, good night, dear.
I'll be home early.
Don't hurry.
Wonder how those got there.
I wonder.
I-- I feel much better.
But that's the way with temperatures.
They come and go quickly.
Yes. They're hot.
Yes. Uh...
Now will you please hurry and dress?
- We can't keep the president waiting.
- No, of course not.
Oh, why don't you both go ahead and I'll get dressed and take another carriage.
Fine.
Oh, by the way, don't bother stopping by the officers barracks.
Lieutenant Latham is out of town.
Oh, but that's impossible.
I saw him last ni--
His troop left at dawn.
The Secretary of War has sent them to guard the Carstair Mines of Sonora.
Well, I--
I think I'll go and fix my hair.
How could you do such a thing?
Me do such a thing?
I'm not the Secretary of War, my dear.
But you're his best friend.
- Father, I'll never forgive you for this.
- You will in time.
I'm going to marry Robert and you can't stop me.
I don't intend to sit idly by and watch my daughter throw her life away on a good for nothing rascal.
You can't just juggle people's lives around like you do in all of your silly old budget figures.
I'm old enough to know my own mind.
At least I'm old enough to know my own heart.
And I love Robert.
Oh, now, now. You--
You-- You--
You only think you do.
- But I do!
- All right! You love him.
Have it your own way.
Aw, but...
You'll get over it.
Time heals everything.
It can't. It wont.
Aw... Now, now, come, come, come.
Yes, it will.
Now, now...
You'll go away somewhere for a rest?
No!
I was just thinking last week.
Why, you can go up to New York and visit your Uncle John.
There's a new company singing at the Opera House.
You would like that.
Oh, come on now.
Tell me you would like that.
Wouldn't you?
Uh-huh.
Well, of course you would.
Now, here. Let's wipe the tears out of those pretty eyes and you go right down to the depot and buy yourself a ticket.
It would cost a great deal of money.
Well, we're not going to worry over trivialities, are we?
Here, $200 should be enough, don't you think?
Oh, it would cost a great deal more than that.
I guess it would just be too expensive.
Has money ever meant anything where my daughter's happiness was at stake?
Of course not. Huh?
You're such a sweet, understanding father.
You always know what's best for me.
You almost always get your own way too, don't you?
Well, almost.
Now, here.
You hurry up and get dressed.
Well, uh, maybe you better go ahead.
No need of us all being late.
Well, uh, all right.
- But you hurry, my dear.
- Yes, I will.
And, thank you, Father.
Oh, not at all, not at all.
Henrietta!
Henrietta!
What you up to, Miss Caroline?
- I'm gonna be married.
- Married? Tonight?
If I can catch up with him.
Have Joseph get a carriage ready.
Where you going, Miss Caroline?
I'm gonna pick that one too.
Yes, but where you going,
Miss Caroline?
- To Pittsburgh.
- Oh, Pittsburgh!
- Maybe Cincinnati.
- Oh.
- Maybe St. Louis.
- St. Louis?
- Maybe California.
- California!
Good heavens!
Just can't stand pryin'.
When a critter starts asking your name, it's getting too inquisitive.
There's a boat!
Grab a line!
Warren, will you stop twisting your hair?
Where's the baby's milk?
Uncle Harry's bringing it.
Careful now.
Look out for that cow.
Would you help me carry my--
Sorry, lady, got a load.
Would you help me carry my trunk?
I'm loaded down too, ma'am.
I wonder if you'd carry my trunk.
No chance, lady.
Keep your eyes peeled for a couple of stowaways.
I'll watch the other gangplank.
I certainly will.
Would you mind helping me with my trunk?
Would you-- Oh, never mind.
Madame. Perhaps I can be of assistance, madame.
Allow me to present myself.
My name is Prince Gregorio
Alexandrovich Strogonoski.
Uh... Oh, yes, his name is Koppa.
My full name is Kapi--
Uh, may I?
Well, it would be a great favor.
I must get ashore immediately.
Immediately, madame.
Uh, Koppa.
Carry the lady's trunk ashore, please.
Oh, surely, surely.
It's very nice of you to be so kind to me, Your Highness.
Madame, no trouble at all.
Uh, ready, madame?
Uh, Koppa, all right.
Madame.
Careful, though.
Ooh, thank you.
- Lovely trip.
- Thank you, sir. Thank you.
I'm certainly grateful to you, gentlemen for helping me with my trunk.
It was a pleasure.
Your Highness!
Your Highness!
Would you mind carrying my trunk just a little further?
I'm terribly sorry--
Oh, but I have to get up there.
Please.
It's so valuable to me.
Why, it's worth its weight in gold.
Oh, with pleasure, madame.
- Delighted.
- Thank you.
- I beg your pardon.
- Mmm-hmm.
I'm looking for a Lieutenant--
I'm a lieutenant.
No, I'm looking for
Lieutenant Latham.
He's with the 4th Cavalry.
Oh, they left last night for Fort Bridger.
Oh, but they told me in St. Louis
I'd catch up with him here.
They're going to guard the Carstair holdings in California.
Yes, I know.
How can I get to Fort Bridger?
I'd be happy to escort you there, madam.
Oh, you would?
Of course, I'll have to get a three weeks furlough.
Oh, where can I get a stagecoach?
There isn't any.
Why don't you stay right here?
There's a wagon train leaving in the morning.
You might be able to arrange a ride with someone.
Be kind of rough.
Oh, I don't care if I can just get there.
- Where are the wagons?
- Down at the end of the street.
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.
Oh, thank you very much.
I think I can find them myself.
Coming, Your Highness?
Uh, yes, madame.
Surely, madame.
Koppa.
Now, my dear friend, Koppa.
We shall see if it's really worth its weight in gold.

Excuse me?
- Howdy, ma'am.
- Hello.
I'm looking for a ride to Fort Bridger.
- Fort Bridger?
- Yes.
Do you know anybody who'd take me?
I'd be glad to pay whatever is right.
Well, uh...
Let me see, uh, miss, uh...
Maybe I could arrange to take you along with us.
Just a minute, Lemuel.
If you was planning on giving this young woman a seat in this wagon, you should've thought of it 13 years ago and saved room.
My profit on the venture was $100,000.
Since then,
I've simply been living on the interest of the money.
Hold the light, please.
Mmm-hmm. Excuse me.
Thank you, my good man.
Interested in buying a wagon, lady?
Why, yes, I am.
It seems to be the only way
I'll ever get to Fort Bridger.
- Are you the owner?
- Yessum. And I don't mind saying you're lucky to find a first class outfit like this, ma'am.
Finest wagon this side of Pittsburgh.
Those horses look a little thin.
Well, to an experienced eye, ma'am, they might appear to be a little bit on the over-trained side, but you mustn't be deceived by appearances, ma'am.
There's blue blood in them steeds.
You see, they've been bred for ruggedness.
Take my word for it, ma'am, horses is just like women.
When it comes to work, it's the little, thin ones that cover the most ground.
Begging your pardon, ma'am, but there ain't nothing wrong with them that a little hay won't fix.
Well, all right.
How much is it?
Well, I'd be satisfied with $400, and $200 for the supplies, as flour, bacon, and beans, she's all ready to go.
I'll give you $500.
Well, you drive a hard bargain, ma'am, but throw in the pouch and it's a deal.
I'm going to open it.
- That's just right.
I'll... I'll be back later with a bill of sale.
Thank you very much.
Oh, Your Highness, would you put the trunk in the wagon for me, please?
Oh, wait a minute!
Koppa.
Do you know where I can get a room for the night with a bath?
Well, you won't find a room, ma'am, but there's a public bath house over on Main Street.
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it, ma'am.
And I wanna thank both of you too.
I don't know what
I would've done without you.

Uh, pardon me.
Has the lady with the nice singing voice come out yet?
No, I don't think so.
Thank you.
Here she comes now.
I, uh, beg your pardon, ma'am.
Yes?
I beg your pardon.
Well, you certainly can't figure men out, can you?
No. Isn't it marvelous?
I got sick and tired of it.
Well, I don't blame you.
He tried to deny it, but I said,
"If you're not drunk,
"let's see you get up off of that ground."
Warren, will you stop twisting that hair?
Stop it.
Interested in buying a wagon, lady?
Why, I just bought one.
This one.
You must be mistaken, ma'am.
This is my wagon.
- Oh, no, it isn't.
- Oh, yes, it is.
I got my papers right here.
But the man sold it to me not more than an hour ago.
I'm afraid you've been hoodwinked, ma'am.
I paid $500 for it.
That's more than
I expect to get for it myself.
Oh, how could anyone do such a thing?
I was planning to leave with the wagon train in the morning.
Oh, what am I gonna do?
You might drop over to the marshal's ma'am.
- Maybe he could help you.
- Thank you.
May I leave my luggage here?
- Yeah, sure.
- With my trunk?
Trunk?
- Howdy, Marshal.
- Howdy, Jack. What you got?
Plenty, including a warrant for some senator's daughter who's run away from home.
Well, what do you know?
Now, the Senator's headed this way by a boat.
He ought to get in some time tomorrow.
I understand there's a $5,000 reward offer.
See, I wouldn't mind bumping into her myself.
Got any idea what she looks like?
Sure, I got a full description of her right here in this bag.
Why don't you let me take you out of here?
It's much too good for you.
Four Queens.
Very pretty.
- Four Aces.
- Nothing.
- I'm cashin' in.
- I'm leavin'.
Hey, these are too small for me.
Keep 'em.
Thanks.
Whoo!
- Well, I owe you $250.
- That's right.
How about cuttin' the cards just once?
Double or nothing.
That sounds like a good idea.
After you, sir.
King.
Well, what do you know?
An Ace.
That'll be $500.
You mark a deck pretty fast for a young fellow.
Just a little bit faster than you do.
That's dollar sign, five-oh-oh.
Well, here's your $500.
Thank you very much.
My 500.
You shouldn't go around grabbing other people's money.
It isn't ladylike.
It's my money.
He swindled me out of it.
Me? Swindled you?
You sold me a wagon you didn't even own.
Do you realize that statement is libelous?
You know it's the truth.
If you people will excuse me, I--
You're not leaving here with my $500.
Why, it's practically the last cent
I had to my name.
And I need it.
I have to get to Fort Bridger.
- I'm le--
- That's very interesting,
- but if you don't mind, I'd like to--
- Now wait a minute.
I bought a wagon and paid for it and now I haven't got a wagon and something's gotta be done about it.
Please, lady, you don't have to shout.
Let's sit down and talk this thing over.
Well, we're not gonna get anywhere unless we have confidence in each other.
Then you let go of the money.
That would be overconfidence.
Well, I'll let go if you will.
That's fair enough.
Just a minute, folks.
There's something
I wanna say to you.
The last time the marshal come down here to make some arrests, the mirrors on the back bar got all busted up during the scuffle.
Now them there mirrors cost a heap of money, and they have to be hauled out here all the way from Chicago.
And that's why I'm warning you.
The marshal's on his way down here now.
He's got a whole hat full of warrants.
Five or six horse thieves, been ridin' kinda high.
Some girl who ran away from her pappy.
$5,000 reward for her return.
Then there's some other warrants for some card sharks.
It's been gettin' outta hand.
Too much double dealin'.
Then there's a few other warrants for various and sundry reasons, such as... murder, homicide, little bit of larceny...
Petty and grand.
Now I don't want nobody to think
I'm trying to thwart lawful justice.
'Cause I ain't.
All I'm trying to do is save my mirrors.
So I'm gonna turn the lights out here in the hall for a few shakes, and them that wants to get can get.
Turn 'em out, boys.
Oh, no, you don't, young lady.
Oh, I beg your pardon, ma'am. I--
All right, turn 'em on, boys.
Well, the marshal will be down here any time now.
What's going on here?
Not so fast, young lady.
You let me by.
I don't wanna tell you how to run your business, lady, but that's my 500.
But I have to get to Fort Bridger.
You said that.
Why'd you run away from your pappy?
None of your business.
Have it your own way then, so it's none of my business.
What's the matter with me?
I don't think very fast.
Are you going to give me that money?
I guess I'm just plain lucky.
I think you're just plain rude.
Here I've been trying to figure out how to get a stake to get started in California, and it's dumped right in my lap.
What are you talking about?
What the man at the saloon was talking about, the $5,000 reward.
Why--
You're really nice, aren't you?
Can you blame me?
Somebody's gonna collect the reward.
- Why shouldn't it be me?
- Because you're a crooked card shark and you can't go near the marshal's office.
That's right.
That means I'll have to have a confederate and split with her.
Do you have any friends here who'd like to get in on a good thing?
Who could I get?
How would you like to get in on a real good thing?
I'm already in on a real good thing.
I'll give you $10,000 to get me to Fort Bridger.
Let's see the money.
I'll give it to you in Fort Bridger.
Ah, who's at Fort Bridger?
Just some army officers.
Army officers don't have $10,000.
I know that.
Who's the richest man in California?
- Richest man in California?
- Mmm-hmm.
Jake Carstair, I guess.
Why?
He's the man who's going to give you the $10,000.
Is Jake Carstair your father?
- Huh-uh.
- Well, then--
- Oh, I see.
- Well, well.
Jake Carstair lives in Sonora.
What's he gonna do, meet you at Fort Bridger?
Mmm-hmm.
You do pretty well, don't you?
Where is this wagon you bought and paid for and didn't get and so on and so forth?
Oh, I, um...
Oh, it's right up there.
- Can you cook?
- Of course not.
- What are you going to do?
- No, that's fine.
2,000 miles of travel ahead of us, and I have to hook up with a gal who can't even boil water.
Oh, then you will take me to Fort Bridger.
There's just one thing.
I can tolerate horse stealing, grand larceny, murder, anything but lyin'.
If you're not telling me the truth, now's the time to say so.
You're standing on my foot.
You'll get your money, all right.
I give you my word.
- Is that the wagon?
- Yes.
Climb up on the seat.
Are we going to leave now?
The wagon train will catch up with us in the morning.
We stay here tonight, the marshal might run into us.
You wouldn't wanna disappoint old Jake Carstair would you?
No. No, of course not.
Come on then.
Would you mind giving me a hand?
Not this time.
Let's get this straight.
You hired me to drive you to Fort Bridger and that doesn't include playing nursemaid to you.
Are you always this insulting?
On this trip, everything's on a 50-50 basis.
That suits me fine.
You take of your 50,
I'll take care of mine.
Very well. Here.
Oh!
Oh, have they gone?
Yes, they've gone.
The Indians. I woke up and they're all lookin' at me.
Did you have to scare 'em?
We might wanna give the country back to them someday.
Your highness.
What do we do now?
- This is a surprise.
- Madame.
What in the world are you doing here?
Err, you see, madam.
We ah...
By a strange coincidence.
Yes, very strange coincidence.
We were just passing by your wagon.
- Back in Independence.
- Yes, Of course, back in Independence. and then we saw your valuable trunk absolutely unprotected, so...
So...
How do you do?
So, we say to ourselves...
Ah... we say...
- Eh...
- We say, Eh...
- Madam is careless.
- Yes, madam is very careless.
- We say.
- The town is full of thieves.
Ah, the town is full of strange characters.
- This trunk is apt to be stolen.
- Positively.
So, we will guard the trunk for Madam.
- No, Gregory sir?
- Yes, yes, exactly.
So we get into the wagon to guard the trunk and... imagine we... we fall asleep.
No.
Yes.
Yes, but when we wake up...
Oh, madam... When we wake up we're surrounded by Indians.
Indians!
Of course, our first thought was Madam's trunk.
Oh, it was a desperate flight... ummm... fight, yes.
Desperate, but we saved it.
- No?
- No.
- Yes.
- Yes!
How can I ever thank you?
Why, if anything had ever happened to this trunk...
I just don't know what I would have done.
So that's the-- Shh...
Well, I was careless, but thanks to you gentlemen.
Everything's all right.
- These are friends of yours?
- Yes.
And I might add, the only gentlemen I've met so far in this wild west barbarous country
Madam.
If you... gentlemen would excuse us, we'll be leaving.
Ah, with your permission, we shall accompany you to California.
Can you cook?
Sure, the last place-- Shh, shut up.
- Cook?
Me?
Of course not.
Then if you hurry you can get back to Independence before night fall.
But you'll have to walk fast.
What you mean, Independence?
Wait a minute.
I'm half owner of that wagon.
You speak for your half.
My half's full.
Hey there!
Howdy folks, you plannin' on tavelin' alone, was you?
No!
Uh, we just got an early start.
We were waiting to join your train.
Well, guess that's all right.
As long as you live up to the rules and regulations.
Who's the boss of the wagon?
I am!
Well, that is... we both are.
Married, I take it?
No!
Positively not!
Well, brother and sister?
We're no relation.
Well, that changes things considerable.
See, we don't allow no unattached females in this train.
Nobody's got time enough to assume responsibility.
- Well, I...
- I...
I guess we'll have to tell him.
On account of her family's objections, the little lady's trying to keep her marriage a secret but...
There's really nothing to worry about.
She's quite safely married to...
Ah, what did you say your name was?
Prince Gregory Stroganovsky.
You heard it.
That's her husband.
That... I mean him...
Get over there.
Everything all right,
Mrs. Stroganovsky?
How do you do, Mrs. Stroganovsky?
How do you do, Mrs. Brown?
No, no, my dear friend, Koppa.
It isn't clear to me.
It isn't.
One minute I'm single, the next minute I'm--
It's the custom of the country.
One moment you're single, the next you're not.
Yes, but nobody can prove
I'm married.
- But who wants to prove anything?
- What do you mean who wants to prove?
All I know what I hear people say is...
How do you do Mrs. Stroganovsky?
I'm Mrs. Brown.
I'm glad to meet you,
Mrs. Stroganovsky I'm Mrs...
No, no all right.
No, no wait a minute.
Your last name is Mr. Pitrowski, isn't it?
Now, now, suppose a woman you've never seen in your life says she's Mrs. Pitrowski?
It means that you're married to her eh?
- Ah ha.
- Then, why...
If a woman says she's
Mrs. Stroganovsky... then you all say she's
Mrs. Stroganovsky...
Why can't a woman say she's Mrs. Pitrowski and be Mrs. Pitrowski? Why?
Because my real name is O'Shanahan.
With a face like that?
Stay in close to the wagon!
Stay in close to the wagon, folks!
Stay close to the wagons, folks.
Did it occur to you,
Mrs. Stroganovsky?
There might be a very good reason why every one else is sticking close to the trail.
I don't remember anything in our agreement which permits you to dictate to me where I shall walk.
What a shame.
It's such a pretty dress too.
I left them simmer about an hour.
That's much too long for them.
Mr. Stroganovsky?
Mrs. Stroganovsky, how do you do?
Warren, stop twisting your hair.
Senator's daughter is single.
You sure this girl your taking me to see is marriage?
Yep, husband's some kind of count or duke or somethin'.
Well, we'll have a look at anyway.
- Excuse me!
- But, what--
I saw that you hit her!
I don't care if she's your wife or not.
I'm not gonna stand by and let you strike a poor defenseless woman!
What's going on here?
- He's beating his wife again.
- No!
- No use trying to deny it.
- Wait a minute he didn't--
Don't stand up for him.
How'd you like a little of it yourself?
- Who do you think you are?
- I'm the marshal.
- Let go of me.
- He's looking for some senator's daughter.
I don't care who he's looking for,
I'm gonna tare you up with my bare hands.
This is misunderstanding!
Please, please!
If you all go, everything will be all right.
I'm very grateful to you for what you've done for me.
Gregory... isn't such a bad husband.
He only beats me when he gets mad.
When I get mad?
Who?
The snake.
Well, then, Mrs. Stroganovsky, everything will be all right.
What did you say her name was?
- Strognanovsky.
- Princess Stroganovsky.
Well, she certainly fits the description they gave me of Senator Frost's daughter Caroline.
You sure your name is Stroganovsky?
Well, that's my married name.
Before I met the prince here.
I was just plain Maggie Murphy.
Sometimes I wish I was plain Maggie Murphy again.
Heaven knows I've tried to be a good wife.
But I know there've been times where I've aggravated him.
I'm sorry that I made him beat me.
Oh, it isn't just for myself.
Well, you see.
Pretty soon there'll be...
You know.
You poor child.
Oh, I hate to go to pieces like this.
I'm not very strong.
Guess, you better have a talk with a doctor.
Well, I used to dabble medicine when I was a young fellow.
May be I could--
Ah, no, thank you, Marshal.
We have a doctor here.
I'll carry you.
- I'm sorry to be such a bother.
- No bother at all.
Now, I've been right proud with every person in this outfit.
- That was a close call, wasn't it?
- Yes.
- I'm certainly grateful--
- Just protecting my 10000 dollars.
Your father certainly doesn't want you to get you to Fort Bridger, does he?
Oh, he just doesn't approve of my marriage.
He's probably the old fashioned type.
Thinks his daughter ought to marry a strapping young fellow and raise a family.
Of course you can't have everything can you?
What you gonna do in California?
Play cards?
Probably get married.
Oh.
What is she like?
The girl you're gonna marry?
Beautiful.
Likes to laugh and have fun.
Of course, she has a serious side too.
Someone has to have it, you know. It's an anchor.
Of course.
Kinda thought we might live on a cloud.
A cloud?
Yeah, those things up there in the sky.
I've got a lucky one.
I call it cloud number seven.
She has a cloud too, nice and fluffy.
Hers is cloud number one.
Kinda thought we might put 'em together.
You know, sorta combine clouds number one and seven.
And walk around on cloud 17 for the rest of our lives.
Gee.
- What's her name?
- Who?
Girl on the fluffy cloud.
I don't know.
I haven't met her yet.
Oh.
Guess maybe it would be all right if you put me down now, huh?
Yeah.
Guess, may be it'd be all right.
Well...
Thanks for knocking me down and everything.
That's all right. May be you can do the same for me sometime.
Bye.
See you later, Caroline.

The whole trouble is, my daughter is too cleaver for you.
She's outsmarted you.
Well, I'm going to get some action.
I'm going to handle this myself.
What time does the next stage coach leave for Fort Bridger?
It don't.
There ain't none.
Well, that's not gonna stop me.
- My compliments, sir.
- Thank you.
420, 440, 460, 480, 500 dollars.
You drive a hard bargain, Senator.
I can honestly say that outfit's worth twice what you're paying for it.
Finest wagon this side of Pittsburgh.
- Well, good luck, Senator.
- Good luck to you.
You hired me as a guide,
You told me that you had the finest wagon this side of Pittsburgh.
Oh, shut up!
There's a trail up here, that leads to Fort Bridger.
Ain't some of the folks plannin' goin' there?
Yeah, as soon as I get this chore finished I'll notify 'em.
Heh.
Warren, why do you twist your hair?
- It's fun for my fingers.
- Oh.
Go on.
I couldn't help it.
Something just came over me.
Something else is coming over you.
- Oh, you wouldn't dare.
- I wouldn't, huh?
No, please.
I'll teach you to push people into the water.
I'll be good.
Stop yelling.
A little water won't hurt you.
I didn't know.
Fort Bridger!
There's a wagon leaving for Fort Bridger!
Anybody wanting to take it, better hurry!
It's about a four hour drive.
We ought to get there before night fall if we don't dally.
Well we're camping here for the night.
Come on, Boyd.
Lets get to gettin'.
- Good bye, Mr. Bigelow.
- Good luck to you, Brown.
Glad to have you with us, Brown.
You get tired of digging potatoes in Fort Bridger.
Come on to California and dig nuggets.
Just a minute, Mr. Brown.
You got room for another passenger?
There's a lady here who'd like to ride into Fort Bridger.
- Well, I reckon we can manage.
- Who is it?
Mrs. Stroganovsky.
You bet you can come with us,
Mrs. Stroganovsky.
You're more than welcome.
And good riddance to bad rubbish I'd call it.
- Come on, I'll help you get your things.
- Johnny, don't--
Can't keep a man like
Jake Carstairs waiting.
Get the trunk and put it in the Brown's wagon.
Why... you mean the trunk...
I saw...
It's too late to argue,
Gregory Stroganovsky!
Your wife's leaving you.
Put the trunk there on the side.
Johnny.
Strange country, women marry me and leave me for no reason at all.
- Gregory let me assure you--
- Hurry up with that trunk!
Don't think it hasn't been a pleasant trip, Mrs. Stroganovsky.
Because I've enjoyed every minute of it.
- But, what about you?
- Don't just stand there.
The Brown's are waiting.
Come on, come on.
But, aren't you forgetting our agreement?
I owe you $10,000.
You give it to me when you get to California.
I may never see you again.
I'll find you. I'll take half your wagon as down payment.
- All set, Mr. Brown.
- All right.
Good bye, Mrs. Stroganovsky.
- Bye, your highness.
- Good bye.
Bye, Koppa.
Bye, Johnny.

Why did you let that fellow take away your girl from you?
- Well, he's as big as I am.
- What difference does that make?
If he tried that with me, you know what I would've done?
What?
- This.
- You would?
- Sure, then this.
- What then?
By this time I got him scared, so I give him this.
Oh!
Here and this.
You think it's hard enough?
Hard enough?
No!
Then I finish him off with this.
Ah, that's...
That's wonderful. That's wonderful.
Thanks.
If a woman is worth having, she is worth fighting for.
Not on your life.
I'm sorry, but there's nothing else leaving for California.
I beg your pardon, Ms. Frost.
Your best chance to catch Lt. Latham--
Thank you, but I've changed my mind.
I'm going back East.
That is if there's anyway I can.
In that case, I'll try and get a line on someone returning to Independence.
Thank you.
Johnny!
Johnny!
I... I couldn't help it.
I thought I could let you go, but...
I don't know what this
Jake Carstairs means to you--
Oh, Jake Carstairs doesn't mean a thing to me.
- You see, Johnny--
- I'm not very bright, am I?
Why didn't you straighten me out?
Johnny, there's something you ought to know about Jake Carstair
I don't wanna know anything about Jake Carstair.
Far as I'm concerned, he doesn't exist.
As far as I'm concerned, he never existed.
Let's go back east, Johnny.
Uh-uh. We're goin' to California.
I spotted a fancy carriage outside.
We'll be back to the wagon train in style.
Oh, we'll be great in California.
You'll have to teach me how to mark the cards and deal from the bottom of the deck and everything.
Do you mean that?
We'll get a new deck in California.

Since we missed her at Fort Bridger, where's our next chance to catch up with her?
Sonora, California would be my guess.
That's just about the end of the line.
Yes, I know that.
That's Jake Carstair's town, you know.
I used to hunt bear with Jake.
Before he struck it rich.
He didn't shoot bears, he just looked at 'em and they died of fright.
I remember one time when...
Hello?
Well, don't just stand there!
Go on!
I'll walk!
I love to walk.

So, I finally broke him with the habit of twisting his hair, all right.
That's fine.
Coming, Warren?
Coming.
This way please.
Come in.
Come in.
Coming, Your Highness?
Yeah, madame.
Koppa, Koppa.
I'll get a shave and meet you here in an hour.
How many times are you gonna shave?
All right, half hour.
Who's the man in the fancy coat?
Oh, that's Jake Carstair.
Carstair?
How's your shooting eye today, eh?
Umm...
Let her go.
All right. Hut.
How'd you like him to shoot at you?
Don't say such a thing.
Not even jest, he must be the best shot in the world.
Toss up a couple of them, Pedro.
Si.
That'll be enough for the day, Pedro.
All right, boys.
Let's all have a drink.
Caroline.
Caroline?
Don't tell me you're ready.
There's something we gotta settle right away.
I thought we could forget about him I have to get dressed. but I was wrong.
All you gotta do is tell him the truth.
Carstair's here.
Carstair?
Where?
Over there.
We'll tell him how things are.
Oh, no. I can't.
Well, I mean... Uh...
- What's wrong?
- Well, it's nothing.
- It's just that I-I...
- What?
You see, I...
I don't quite know how to say it.
What's the matter with me?
I don't think very fast.
You just don't want to hurt his feelings, do you?
- Oh, no. That isn't it, Johnny.
- You go ahead and get dressed.
I'll tell him myself.
Oh, no. No.
I-I-I'll tell him.
Umm-umm... You go get changed.
- I'll come with you.
- No. I'd rather see him alone.
Much rather. Which one--
- I mean, where did you say he is?
- Over there.
Oh, yes.
Well, I-I won't be long.
So you hurry too.
All right.
- Good luck.
- Yeah.
Mr. Carstair.
Mr. Carstair?
- Mr. Carstair.
- Yes.
Oh, are you Jake Carstair?
That's right.
Well, what can I do for you.
Well, I haven't got time to explain but you're the man
I was supposed to marry.
- What?
- Please do me a favor.
The man I'm going to marry thinks you're in love with me.
Oh, I know this doesn't make sense to you but Johnny...
He's the man I'm in love with.
He's standing right up there watching and...
Wait!
Oh. Things aren't as they used to be Jake.
I've grown up. I've found someone I love.
Oh, I-I know it's a shock to you to hear me say that but...
Well, there-there isn't anything for me to say but-but I'm sorry.
Please act hurt, will you?
How could you do such a thing?
I can't let you go.
- Caroline.
- Caroline.
I'll never let you go.
You're everything I have.
- My very life.
- Don't over do it.
Uh, one thing is not very clear to me.
Is she still Mrs. Stroganovsky?
Because if she is--
Because if she...
Where is this up-starter who's trying to take you away from me?
Probably cringing in some dark corner, ashamed to show his face.
You're wrong, Mr. Carstair.
So this is him, huh?
You mean to tell me you'd give up all the things
I could give you for-for this?
I know you're a big man,
Mr. Carstair.
You got wealth, and power.
If I thought she'd be happy with you,
I'd be all for it.
But I know she wouldn't be because she isn't in love with you.
She's in love with me.
She even told me so.
Well, I know when I've been licked.
I wish you both the best of luck.
Thank you.
Drinks for the house.
Drinks for the lovers.
Long may they wave.
Mrs. Carstair.
Good afternoon, Mrs. Carstair.
A toast.
A toast to your happiness.
And please, always keep a tiny spot in your heart for Jake Carstair who loved you but lost.
And here's to Jake Carstair, who loved me and lost but...
I'll never forget him.
Just a minute.
Oh, hello, my dear one.
Now who is it that you've loved and lost, Jake?
We were toasting this young couple.
Answer my question.
Who's the young lady?
Someone I just met.
I mean...
I'm Mrs. Carstair.
How do you do, Mrs. Carstair?
I can explain-- Don't you think you're a bit old to go about loving and losing?
Please, Mrs. Carstair, let me explain.
I've never seen your husband before in my life. I...
Johnny.
The thing which is not very clear to me is when, if you...
Johnny.
Johnny, wait a minute.
Please?
Johnny.
- Johnny, wait. I can explain.
- You lied to me.
Oh, I just wanted you to take me with you.
That's the only reason I made up the story about Carstair.
You did?
Oh, don't you know there isn't anybody else in the whole wide world but you?
Caroline.
Darling.
It's my fiancée.
Will you excuse me a moment, please?
You followed me. I knew you would.
- Robert.
- Let me look at you.
- There's something I have to tell you.
Johnny...
It's still not clear to me whether you...
Johnny.
Were you... Uh...
Please give me a chance to explain.
Caroline, what's the meaning of this?
This is the man I was coming out here to marry.
Well, go ahead and marry him then.
- Caroline, I demand an explanation.
- Later, Robert.
I'm the idiot that toted this bright young lady
3,000 miles so she could marry Jake Carstair.
Jake Carstair?
Yes. But from what I can see now, you're the one she's going to marry.
You must be the one because it certainly isn't going to be me.
You better hurry up about it before someone else races up and yells,
"Caroline, darling."
Caroline, darling.
Whoa, whoa. Hold him, hold him.
Stop him, stop him.
Are you all right?
You see what I mean?
The line forms to the right, Mister.
Are you all right, Dear?
Just a minute, Father.
Don't think for one moment that I'm running after you because I'm not.
Caroline, you'll make me the laughing stock of my whole regiment.
She will if you give her time.
Who's the old geezer?
Jake Carstair's brother?
Punch him right in the nose, Robert.
Caroline.
What's the meaning of this?
Just a minute, Father.
And one more thing, Mr. Lawlor.
Don't think you can apologize and come crawling back--
Caroline, I demand an--
I don't know who you are, young man.
But I'm on your side.
I resent that,
Oh, shut up.
Senator.
It's obvious there's been some misunderstanding.
There's no misunderstanding, Sir.
Your daughter's just a liar.
Robert, are you gonna stand for that?
I most certainly am not.
Shut up. It's really not her fault.
You see, she comes from a long line of liars.
I'm a politician.
My father was a politician.
- I remember--
- Now, wait a minute.
I've stood this just about long enough.
Caroline, what does this man mean to you?
If you expect to marry me,
I demand a full account of your conduct with him.
After all, I have a position to maintain.
Try this position.
This is too much.
All I want is peace and quiet.
No, no, no.
I wouldn't want a wife like this.
Trunk.
Trunk.
I don't mind tellin' you, brother you're gettin' the finest bell this side of Pittsburgh.

Here's your two.
Two more.
That's in.
Gentlemen..
...to every life a little rain must fall.
Yeah, but I've never seen it rain so steady.
One way.
Is that a general complaint?
Or just a casual remark?
No complaints, mister.
We just want another chance.
- That's all.
- Of course.
Anytime you say.
Thank you, gentlemen, for a very interesting evening.
Who is he?
Where'd he come from?
He didn't say.
I still can't figure it out.
And with our cards.
- Goodnight.
- Night.
Hey, you gents got a room here?
Come on in, Wylie.
'You, uh, surprised to see me again?'
Slightly.
I thought we closed our tally book a year ago.
You mean, we couldn't prove you fleeced those fellows in Texas.
No.
Tally book's still open.
'You're a smart bird, Wylie.'
'But I think we finally got the salt on your tail.'
Really?
I could never catch any that way.
Where was I perched at the time?
Oh, maybe..
...Carson City, Nevada.
In the ally behind the hotel.
That was self defense, Yancey.
Those fellows drew first.
Both of 'em?
And you didn't get hit?
No.
You're fast, Wylie, but you ain't that fast.
How would I know she was the sheriff's daughter.
I couldn't find a badge.
Cut the jokes, Wylie.
You're lucky neither one of those men got killed.
But they're still very anxious to get ahold of you in Carson City.
You wanna go back there with me?
Not if they're that anxious.
Why?
- Do I have any choice?
- One.
Just one.
Take a look at this map.
You see those markings?
'Every circle means a hold-up.'
'And every hold-up means that Wells Fargo Company' lost a lot of money.
Sometimes it was a bank safe.
Sometimes a stagecoach.
But every time it was the same man.
Working alone.
Very interesting.
Just where do I come in?
You know, I never held up anything.
Except cards.
Oh, I'm not saying it was you.
Whenever this fellow pulled a job he always left a piece of verse.
Like this.
'"I'm happy the frontier is settling down.'
"With a thriving bank in every town.
"Let the riders and nesters deposit their pay.
'So I and my gun can take it away."'
'And he always signs it,
The Poet.'
That poem alone is enough to hang the fella.
He's cost us over $50,000 on transfer jobs we've insured for Wells Fargo.
And he's given us a black eye all over the West because we can't catch him.
Every man we send after him comes back with his tail between his legs.
If he comes back at all.
- What does he look like?
- 'That's just the trouble.'
'We don't know what he looks like.'
But he knows us.
So, we're willing to make a deal with you, Wylie.
Nobody knows you in this territory.
You look like a gentlemen.
And I've got a hunch this bird does too.
Yancey..
...you're about as smart as a private detective ever gets.
But, if you think I'm gonna do your dirty work for you--
Wait a minute, Wylie.
Here's the deal.
You bring this fellow in, dead or alive..
...with good proof either way..
...and we'll forget we ever heard about you.
What's the reward?
Twenty thousand dollars.
Why?
You say some of your men didn't return.
Sounds like a tough job.
We got a tip
The Poet's organizing a gang around Cheyenne.
There's a stage leaving for there in the mornin'.
Be on it.
Suppose I'm not?
You'll be on it.
Or you'll go back to Carson City.
That's the deal.
Whoever had that call for 6:15.
Well, when it's 6:15 you'd better get up.
Playing them newfangled contraptions anyway.
What'll they think of next?
Nine.
Ten. And that's all.
Ten pails of water.
Doggonit, that's enough to drown a buffalo in.
'Could you close that door?'
'There's a draft in here.'
'I said, would you mind closing that door, mister?'
Never mind the mister.
What are you doing in there?
- Who me?
- Yes, you, whoever you are.
You got a lot of gall.
That's my bath tub.
Now, get out of it.
- Right now?
- Yes, right now.
I'll give you two minutes to get out of the room.
Well, if you're gonna stand there, I'll have to walk right by you to get my clothes.
O-oh, no, you won't.
I'll give 'em to you.
Oh, no, d-don't bring them around here.
I don't intend to.
They're comin' in by themselves.
Now, that's where you made your mistake.
Now I am gonna take my time.
If there's one place that's sacred to a man it's a bathroom.
Oh, we'll see about that.
I'll call the manager.
'Go ahead.
I'll wash him, too.'
Ah-ah-ah.
No peeking.
I hope you drown.
Don't worry, I've been in much deeper water than this.
Well, swim out of that.
- Yes, ma'am?
- Cup of coffee, please.
Hey, Curly.
How much longer I got to wait for that Cheyenne stage?
Ain't no tellin'.
Could be soon or sometime after dinner.
What? You mean, I'm stuck with that bear steak again?
Well, take it or leave it, ma'am.
What a hotel this sheepherder runs.
No keys, no locks on the door.
Even have to barricade yourself in the bathroom.
No hard feelings I hope.
- No.
- Good.
I've cooled off too.
Cup of coffee and a donut.
How about a donut, brown eyes?
Mm-mm.
They are brown, ain't they?
Mm-hmm.
Say, uh, where did we, uh..
Don't you remember?
Oh, yes.
As I soon as I got through
I folded it up and put it in the corner.
How long have you had it?
I don't know.
It's a cute little trick.
I was never in one like that before.
'Oh, there it is.'
'Cheyenne stage.'
Well, thanks.
Goodbye.
I'm afraid maybe I...broke one of your legs holding it up.
But I'll be very glad to fix it for you.
Oh, no.
I feel fine.
I tried to fix this tub up for you, lady but I didn't have no time.
It's alright. Put those on the stage for me, will you please?
Well, thank you.
You sure did splash a lot of water around up there.
'Stage leaving for Arapahoe'
'Coyote Springs and Cheyenne.'
'Get aboard if you wanna.'
'Take good care of this here thing, mister.'
'It's one them female problem.'
Anything else on your mind?
No. Get on.
'Hyah! Gallop.'
Hey! Ride.
Keep goin'.
Well we've got a long journey ahead of us.
I think maybe we oughta introduce ourselves, don't you?
I'm Emily Carson.
I'm James Wylie.
- You can call me Jim.
- Oh, I will.
If you call me Emily.
Um, where was it you said we met, Mr. Wylie?
- I mean, Jim.
- That was my mistake.
I had you confused with this lady.
But in the excitement
I didn't quite get her name.
I'm Ann Kincaid.
And you're lucky that's all you didn't get.
Please, forgive me, Ms. Kincaid.
If I've known this morning in the bathroom that you were so lovely..
...I would've left your tub immediately.
It's not as bad as it sounds, Ms. Carsie.
I hope the screen didn't hurt your head.
No, no, it wasn't my head.
Thank you.
You two sound like old friends.
Uh, would you like a little nip?
To settle the dust.
No, thank you.
- Jimmy?
- No, thanks.
Well, happy days.
"Oh, woman, lovely woman.
"Nature made thee to temper man.
We would be brutes without you."
You're quite a poet,
Mr. Wylie.
Oh, I have a lot of hidden talents.
You'll be surprised.
Lily of the Valley, Ann?
Hmm. Well, no thank you.
Oh.
Smell, Jimmy?
- Hmm.
- 'Nice?'
Nice.
Is that another of your hidden talents?
It is when I work it right.
Are you a gambler?
All men are gamblers, Emily.
Otherwise we never get married.
There's a 10,000,
I promise you, boys.
- Chalkeye?
- Yeah?
- You take care of the guard.
- Right.
Pecos, cover the door.
- Jack, grab the leader.
- Yeah.
Bucky, you cover the driver.
Kid, you're new at this. You watch how the other boys work.
Sure.
Alright, go get it.
Hey! Ho!
Hey! Ho!
Ha!
- It's a hold-up.
- How many are there?
There are five of 'em.
That's too many.
Ha!
Ha!
Hey!
Hey!
Ho!
Alright, throw down the strongbox.
Come on, get out, all of you.
Alright, kick in, mister.
First the watch, pronto.
If you lay a hand on me, you big jug-head
I'll bite it off.
Wait your turn, sister.
Now, let's have your roll.
'Hey, this fellow packed a load.'
'Oh, that's just chicken feed.'
Wait'll we get that box open.
You'll see some real money.
- Come on, give me the necklace.
- Try and get it.
You're wasting your time on that junk. It's only worth four bits.
- How'd you know?
- I bought it for her.
'What's that?'
"I'll write you a rhyme, most any old time and you'll only keep filling my purse."
"But stay out of my way or some fine day..
"...you'll be taking a ride in a hearse.
The Poet."
We're doing good, ain't we?
We split nothing six ways again.
This Poet fellow ain't gonna live very long horning in on us.
This here is our range.
Yeah, you mean, it was.
Wait till the boss hears about this.
Something missing from the box?
What do you know about it?
Me?
Nothing.
I would like my gun back, if you don't mind.
Oh, you would, huh?
It has sort of a sentimental attachment.
Is that what keeps it from working?
Go ahead, give it to him, he'll never use it.
Maybe he don't know how to use it.
Now get in there and don't look back this side of Cheyenne.
What a bunch of riff-raff's getting into this country.
You smell like a bunch of billy goats.
Smellin' good's your business, girlie, not ours.
Guess, you'd like these too, huh?
Set them horses to movin' and keep moving.
Paddle.
Hay.
Hay!
Billy! Hey, Brownie.
Get goin'.
What'd I tell you, it couldn't been easier.
Couldn't been no emptier either.
The Poet.
We got a little money from one of the passengers.
That ain't the 10,000 you promised us we'd get.
Shut up, I'm sick of ya beefin'.
And if you don't like the way
I work a job, get outta here.
Work what job? You ain't set us up a good one in three months.
Maybe you got the rest of these boys buffaloed at Sundance but not me.
You're nothing but a yellow, low-down, dirty--
Anybody else feel that way?
Speak up.
Well, what do you know?
I clean forgot about my little protector.
Every girl ought to travel with a gun.
That is, if she can remember she has one.
Or else with the man that can remember he is one.
Oh. Oh.
You're late there, Charlie.
What held you up?
Five men. Didn't get their names but Sam there caught a slug in his shoulder.
Oh, get him up to doc's.
Where're you stopping, brown eyes?
Shh.
Not so loud, Jim.
I get a gentlemen friend in town.
He don't expect me, but I don't wanna surprise him too much.
Goodbye.
Anything I can do for you, ma'am?
No, thank you.
You must be a nervous wreck after what you've been through.
Driver, would you see that my trunks get to Ms. Kittredge.
'Yes, ma'am.'

Hit 'em twice. Pronto.
Oh, I ain't got no luck tonight.
Come on, Chalkeye.
Let's put the girls over.
Remember him, don't you?
Yeah.
He's the fellow we took the 1000 from.
That's right.
Think he spotted us?
Maybe.
Yeah.
He made us alright.
We don't wanna make a play here.
Drop 'em.
I said, drop 'em.
Alright, reach for it.
Both of you.
How about that money you lifted off me today?
I don't know anything about it.
Where is it?
Bucky's got it.
Where do we find Bucky?
I don't know.
We ain't seen him.
Try again.
The other side of town.
That's better.
Put your hands behind you and start walkin'.
Drop it.
Alright, I'll take my stuff back now.
Come on, shell out, it was just 20 short of a 1000.
I ain't got it.
The boss took it.
Who's the boss?
Where is he?
He's in there.
Tell him to come out.
Hey, Sundance..
...there' somebody out here who wants to see you.
I told you I was busy, didn't I..
Alright, Chalkeye, take his gun.
Who is he?
What's he want?
This here, is the fellow we lifted the money from today.
And now he wants it back.
Get outside, see if anybody come in with him.
Nah, he stuck us up alone.
Chalkeye and me.
That wasn't so smart.
You push your luck a little too far coming in here.
- Lemme get a crack at him.
- Keep outta this.
So you spotted us at the hold-up, huh?
Everyone except you, Sundance.
I'll sell you my roll and cheap watch you boys didn't do so well, did you?
If I'd known how hungry you were
I might have left a few dollars in that box.
What're you trying to say, that you're the--
That's right.
So, if you don't mind--
I think he's lying.
I was driver in the Panhandle hold-up.
I didn't see any port that look like this hombre.
Well, maybe he is, maybe he isn't, I don't know.
But there's somebody here that does.
Who's that?
Your wife.
Naturally.
I wouldn't have a wife that didn't know me.
Step out here a minute.
You know this fella?
Yes, I certainly do.
Is he your husband?
What did he say?
'He claims he is.'
Why should I deny?
Honey, this is the first time you've ever said so in public.
This is the first good chance I've had.
You said you'll wait for me at the house.
What made you decide to come here?
I got a little impatient.
You know how it is?
How could my boys know you is The Poet?
They ain't no smarter than anybody else.
Not by a long shot.
That's no mistake.
- Forget it.
- Sure, I will if you will.
My watch, please?
Here you are.
Give him his gun.
Come on, dear.
Lets get out of here.
Hold on.
You ain't mad, are ya, Poet?
Oh, no.
Not at all.
Then why don't we talk over your propositions?
Some other time.
- Shall we go?
- 'What propositions?'
The one his wife brought me just now.
"Put in with me and you'll be rich
"before you know it.
"Is it yes or no?
If yes, lie low till word comes from The Poet."
We're ready to listen.
What's the deal?
Well, just as I say here.
Wait till you hear from me.
We don't like to rush things, do we, darling?
That's up to you, dear.
Goodnight, gentlemen.
I never thought I'd see somebody bluff you out of that much money.
He ain't just somebody and he ain't bluffin'. He's The Poet.
- I still don't believe it.
- Why not?
He kissed the girl like he liked it.
That ain't like no husband.
Some husbands like it.
Anyways, they's together on the stage, wasn't they?
He probably come along to laugh at us when we busted open that empty box.
Yeah, but he didn't laugh.
If he's who he claims to be we can work him like a gold mine.
But if he ain't..
...he knows enough to hang us.
We gotta make sure.
That was kind of a shotgun range, wasn't it?
I don't know why you did it, but thanks anyway.
Only a tenderfoot or a fool would walk into a trap like that.
Which one are you?
After that kiss,
I feel like both.
You got me out of a tight spot.
Why?
Not because
I like you, Mr. Wylie
I only did it to save your neck.
Why did you go there?
To get my watch and my money back.
Please, Mr. Wylie,
I know you're the law.
You went there to get a line on The Poet.
Otherwise you wouldn't have claimed to be him.
Now you're guessing.
All you know about me is that
I got into your bathtub once.
Are you really married to him?
You're a detective, you tell me.
My guess, that even if he is your husband, you..
...don't quite approve of it.
Otherwise you wouldn't have helped me.
You're right, Mr. Wylie.
I wanna see The Poet put away just as much as you do.
And I'm the only one who can help you.
You could help him, too.
If I am the law.
- Where is he?
- I'm not sure.
But I'm expecting a letter from him very soon.
One more thing.
Who is he?
Haven't you had enough for one evening?
Don't tease me,
I may follow you in.
Don't try it,
I may throw you out.
What is it?
I think it's a couple of Sundance's boys.
They wanna make sure we're married.
Shall we go in?
Is this also part of your plan, Mr. Wylie?
No.
No, but, uh,
I wouldn't put it past you.
Good idea to pull the shade..
..before you light a lamp.
Got in trouble in there once.
- What's back there?
- A kitchen.
And a back door.
Goodnight.
There's another one perched out in the backyard.
There's no privacy at all in this town.
What're you gonna do?
What they expect a married man to do at this hour.
Stay home.
What're you doing? Moving out?
It's your bunk.
Unless you wanna sleep in my tub.
Tell you what I'll do..
I'll match you for the bed.
Go on in there.
Oh, be a sport.
I'd match you if this were my house.
I'll bet you would.
Flip it.
- Call it.
- Heads.
Better luck next time.
Goodnight.
If you're not up before daylight, the deal's off.
'I don't recall that we'd made any deal. Yet.'
Say, uh, what'll happen if your other husband walks in here tonight?
Nothing, he's a nice fellow.
He'll simply put his arm around your neck..
...and break it.
Thanks, I'll sleep with one eye open.
What do you think I'm gonna do?
- Good morning, ma'am.
- Wait a minute.
Who are you?
Where did you bunk?
In the front room.
With Miss Kincaid?
With, uh, Mrs. Kincaid.
And I could use another blanket.
I'm Mr. Kincaid.
She didn't tell me she was married.
Well, you see, she gets confused.
I'm a traveling man and I just drop in on her occasionally.
I'm going uptown to get a cup of coffee.
Good morning.
Didn't I tell you to get out before daylight?
Never mind hemming and hawing, get out!
Well, miss, or madam, whichever the case may be.
I see, um, you've met my husband.
Yes, so he said.
Well, we had a little tiff.
You know how husbands are.
Oh..
Well, I guess all men are alike before breakfast.
Before and after.
My he sure is handsome.
'If you like that type.'
Oh, yes, I like a rugged man.
If a man ain't rugged, he just ain't a man, I always say.
He's rugged alright.
Mr. Kincaid tells me he's a salesman.
One of the best.
Any, uh, little ones?
- Little what?
- Babies.
Oh, yes. Three.
Uh, they're in, um,
Kansas City with his mother.
My goodness.
Three babies at your age?
They don't ask you how old you are.
Hello, Jim.
You alone?
Sit down.
How'd you like my song last night?
Fine, only I liked your outfit better.
Oh...you left early.
You should've waited for my specialty.
Well, I'll be around.
I'll catch up on that.
Gee, those flapjacks look good.
Hmm.
Joe, gimme the same.
Hey..
Those hoodlums took your dough yesterday.
- You need any?
- No thanks.
I had some luck last night.
Oh..
Hmm, looks if you had some yourself.
Yeah. My gentleman friend sure was glad to see me.
I want to make a complaint.
Yes, ma'am, most folks do.
Was it goods in transit, or failure to arrive?
Neither one. Mistreatment while a passenger.
Maybe you'd better talk to the inspector, Mr. Landers.
Inspectors. What satisfaction do you ever get from them?
Mr. Landers, this here lady wants to make a complaint.
Will you come in, madam?
You must excuse the appearance of my office.
Uh...I only arrived in town last night, and--
Do you see this bruise?
I got it yesterday in the hold-up.
If you think you can treat your passengers like that..
Ann, I've missed you.
Three months is a long time.
You could've written me more often, Ed.
I would've, dear, but..
...there are people who collect my writings.
Yes, I know, I met one of them yesterday.
Oh, you mean Sundance.
I am sorry I had to send you there.
That poem was just to stall..
...to keep him out of my way.
I don't mean Sundance.
No? Who then?
I'm not sure I'll tell you.
Why not?
Ed, look, we've been married for three years and in all that time, we've had only a few weeks together.
I didn't know what you were when I married you..
...and when I found out,
I was too much in love with you to run away.
I told you in Denver
I'd give it up soon.
I meant that.
I still mean it.
That's why I sent for you.
There's just a lot of business to clean up here in Cheyenne.
I can't leave
Wells Fargo too suddenly without arousing suspicion.
By this time next week, dear, we'll be in San Francisco.
With everything you want.
How does that sound?
Very lovely..
...if I could believe it.
Have I ever lied to you?
Yes, you have.
Every time we've met.
I wanted you to keep a few illusions about me.
Well, I don't have many left.
Ann..
Is this your subtle way of telling me there's another man in your life?
Yes, there is one, Ed..
...but he's in your life, not mine.
Well... then shouldn't I know?
I'll tell you this much about him.
Yesterday in Laramie
I saw him with Webb Yancey.
He also came to Cheyenne on the same stage.
Point him out to me.
No, I don't want you to kill him and I don't want him to kill you.
I want you to get away.
Alright.
But I need three days.
You've got to help.
Well, thanks for the breakfast.
I'd like to take another walk with you, but my gentleman friend's kinda jealous.
He wants me to marry him.
Why not? Maybe you'll like it.
That's what he says.
Well, goodbye.
Oh, good morning, dearie.
Too bad you weren't here earlier.
Jim and I had breakfast together.
He sure is handsome.
- Think so?
- Mm-hmm.
You know, I think you could get him if you played your cards right.
- Interesting.
- Well, good luck.
- Morning.
- Good morning.
You get up early.
I got a letter from him.
He wants me to meet him at
South Forks day after tomorrow.
Where's that?
West of here, 50 or 60 miles.
And I'm to go there with you, is that it?
If you want to pick him up.
Tell me, besides not liking him..
...you have any other reason for turning him over to me?
What do you mean, other reason?
The reward.
Twenty thousand.
Maybe.
I could use half of it.
Well, looks like we've made a deal.
I don't know for sure what cards you hold..
...but if we split the part,
I'd take less chance
'than by playing this hand alone.'
'And you'll live longer, too.'
When do we start?
We can go by stage first thing in the morning.
Then we stay at South Forks tomorrow night.
Does that bother you?
Not too much.
By the way..
Let me have a look at that letter.
Don't you trust me?
I'll tell you after I read it.
"Meet me at South forks on the evening on the 25th.
Your affectionate husband."
Now are you convinced?
O, Miss Kincaid, I just made a pot of fresh coffee.
Would you and your husband care to have some?
Thank you, I'll be right in.
Oh, by the way, if you must come back tonight you're the father of three children.
I am?
- Since when?
- This morning.
They're in Kansas City with your mother.
Hey, mister.
Got a match?
Kept some of your boys up a little late last night, didn't ya?
I don't know what you're drivin' at.
When are we gonna start working together.
I'll tell you when just as soon as I finish my honeymoon.
You've already had one.
We want another one.
You know how women are.
Like bears, they never get enough honey.
See you later.
Didn't get much sleep last night, did you?
It was almost daylight when you got in.
I just dropped by at the bird cage for a few hands of poker.
That's where your friend
Lily of the Valley works, isn't it?
'Lily who?'
You know who I mean.
Don't be jealous.
I'll never get in her tub.
Where do you hail from, Annie?
Colorado.
And don't call me Annie.
That's why I left the ranch.
Ooh, cattle man's daughter, eh?
What did you do, fall for the big city slicker?
Didn't you ever make a mistake?
Sure.
I may be making one now.
You're hopeless.
Halt.
Well, this is South Forks or what's left of it.
Don't see nobody around here waiting for you folks.
They'll be here later.
Adios.
Giddy up there, come on.
Come on, Ellie.
So, these are the comfortable quarters you were talking about.
It seems to be the right place but...I thought it was still in use.
Maybe it still is.
Come on, we'll see.
Hello, Poet.
How'd you boys get so far from home?
We're just looking the country over.
What brought you here?
I told you yesterday
I was going on a honeymoon.
They told us we'd find comfortable quarters here.
I'm a fine husband, eh, dear?
Never mind.
Maybe there's another stage going back tonight.
Is there?
You oughta know the stage-runs better than me.
That's your specialty, ain't it?
Now and then.
But this isn't my territory.
Yeah.
That's the way I figured too.
Well, it's very romantic.
Couldn't we manage just for one night?
I suppose so, Annie.
Could you let us have some blankets and food?
Sure, anything you want.
- Thanks.
- You know..
Like I told you before, me and the boys are ready to throw in with ya whenever you say.
Don't rush me, Sundance.
I'm no two-bit operator.
When I have something ready,
I'll let you know.
How soon do you figure that'll be?
I don't know yet.
Anything else we can do for ya?
Yes.
Have one of the boys bring in our bags.
'Bring 'em in.'
And, uh...rustle up a little wood for the fire.
Let him rustle his own wood.
He puts on his pants the same as me.
He puts 'em on faster.
Go on.
Sundance, you ever been on a honeymoon?
Yeah, a couple of 'em. Why?
Well, uh, you don't wanna be on mine.
So we'll stay in here.
I hope you gentlemen wouldn't mind bunking in the back room.
Not if you don't keep us in the back room too long.
'Course you didn't know about this.
Don't be a fool, why should I?
Just happen to remember that you knew Sundance, that's all.
You don't think he's The Poet, do you?
Maybe I was just a little nervous.
Not you, Mr. Wylie.
You haven't any more feelings than a ten-minute egg.
I wouldn't count on that.
I still say they ain't married.
You see him tickle her chin?
Married men don't do that.
No, not to their own wives.
Here we go again.
What's that for?
You know, a rattlesnake won't cross if you have rope.
Tickles it, makes it stay where it belongs.
Does the rattlesnake know that?
Can't you get that bar room canary out of your mind?
Ooh, that's who I got it from.
That was worrying me.
Better start worrying about tomorrow.
These boys may get in our way.
They're not helping me very much tonight.
What'd you expect them to do?
Tuck you in?
The best things in life, you don't expect.
'They happen too quick.'
It's how a lot of men get killed too.
- Goodnight.
- I wanted to talk.
I don't know much about you.
Well, don't talk, just listen.
'Go ahead, I'm listening.'
Good. Now lie down.
Close your eyes.
- They're closed.
- Go to sleep.
Oh, Annie, is that a nice way to talk on a honeymoon?
You don't have to talk on a honeymoon.
I mean..
Oh, shut up.
Don't mind if
I dream a little, do ya?
Depends on what you dream.
Don't walk in your sleep, you may get in the wrong room.
Oh, Annie, you worry too much about me.
I'm just a big country boy at heart.
What's that?
What happened?
Something cross the rope?
That's not funny, country boy.
What size shoe do you wear?
Alright, put your foot where it belongs.
Don't tempt me.
They're still asleep.
What a surprise he's got coming to him.
I don't know, might be bad luck to double-cross him.
Yeah, he's the kind of a fellow who would kill you for two bits and give you back
20 cents change.
I know what I'm doing.
He don't wanna cut us in on this deal.
All that talk he gave us last night was just to stall.
Sure, he didn't come up here on no honeymoon.
Nobody goes on a honeymoon west of the Missouri.
Pack your stuff and get hitched.
Well, he won't cross us up again like he did in that Laramie job.
This time we're gonna sop our bread in The Poet's gravy.
Ha!
Hiya.
The passenger here's gone cold on us.
Looks like The Poet dipped his bread in our gravy again.
What's that you got?
I reckon the fellow on the coach there was a whiskey drummer.
Get on your horses.
This is gonna be a showdown.
Found where the corralled their horses last night.
They must have left early this morning.
But I have a hunch they'll be back.
Your hunch was right.
But there're only three of them.
Looks like there's gonna be some flies in the buttermilk.
Get over against the back wall and keep quiet.
'Come here, cut the cards.'
Wanna see what my luck is.
You fellows left quietly this morning.
Come back to get your blankets?
No, we come back to have a talk with you, Poet.
- Go ahead.
- 'You are The Poet, ain't you?'
I told you, didn't I?
- Yeah, that's what you said.
- Call his bluff.
You write this?
Sure I did.
So you fellows went out and struck up the Cheyenne stage on an empty stomach.
That ain't all that was empty.
When'd you clean out the box and put this in?
Yesterday in Cheyenne.
'Too bad you fellows didn't tell me what you had in mind.'
Quit palavering. Thought you had split cases with me, did ya?
Stake me out while you double-cross me.
I can appreciate your disappointment, Sundance.
Perhaps next time, we can--
There ain't gonna be no next time.
You been lying to us right along.
I don't have to take that from you two.
I wanted to cut you in on a big job where I needed some help.
If you wanna check out now, it's alright with me.
I'll give ya half of the 10,000 that was in the box otherwise you get nothing.
Where is the money?
Cheyenne.
I'll meet you there at your place tonight.
How do we know you'll show up?
You can take my wife as security.
Fair enough. It's a deal.
Wait a minute.
Make him put it in writing.
'Yeah...that's a good idea.'
Write this out again.
Let's see how they match up.
'Go ahead.'
Got a pencil?
There's one in my valise.
Jim. Jim.
You handled it fine.
Congratulations.
What do you mean?
The way you steered me out of town so he could move in.
You really had me fooled there for a while.
What a chop I was to think you could be on a level about anything.
We'll talk about that on the way back.
Get away.
You think you're put together with horseshoe nails with the ends cinched over.
Well, I know somebody that can take you apart.
Not many wives think their husbands are that good.
He'll kill you.
I've got to figure out the other way around.
Aren't you gonna get me a horse?
You're a cattleman's daughter.
Get one yourself.
Where do I find the sheriff?
Right up there on the hill.
There's his first deputy right alongside him.
- Who's taken their place?
- Oh, nobody.
I'm the second deputy, but I don't work at it.
Ain't worth the risk here in Cheyenne it ain't.
It was little shoot and scrape down at South Forks.
Better go out and bring 'em in.
- Anybody dead?
- Three of them.
Why didn't you say so?
I ain't afraid of the dead ones.
It's live performance like Sundance.
We'll find him down there too.
Sundance?
He's been ducking me for years.
Are you sure he's dead?
I'll get me a posse, and go out and bring 'em right in.
Mr. Landers.
What is it, Timberline?
I'm busy.
He told me not to open those strongboxes without you here for witness.
Then go ahead. Open it.
Something I can do for you?
Yes.
They sent a westbound stage out here this morning.
That's right. What about it?
It was held up near South Forks.
What?
- How'd you know?
- I got the boys who did it.
- Who are they?
- Sundance and his gang.
What about our strongbox?
I got it.
But it was empty.
Except for this.
The Poet again.
That's twice in three days.
You seem to know a lot of things.
Who are you?
- Is that your office?
- Yeah.
Come in. I wanna talk to you.
You make yourself mighty free around here.
What's your business?
The moment I'm tending to yours nobody else seems able except The Poet.
You're working for Wells Fargo?
In a way, yes.
For Webb Yancey.
My name is Wylie.
That's typical of Yancey.
His men always show up after a robbery and leave before the next one.
When do you pull out?
Maybe I'll stick around for the next one.
Have you any idea who this fellow might be?
Sure, sure.
I can point him out to you.
I just let him take $60,000 of the company's money for fun.
That's why I'm an inspector.
Then you inspected the strongbox before it was put on the stage this morning.
I didn't have to.
That box came from Laramie under double lock.
- It hadn't been touched.
- Who's got the keys?
Two Wells Fargo agents.
One in Laramie, the other in Fort Bridger.
And how does The Poet work it?
What's your guess?
That's what we're paying Yancey to tell us.
What have you found out, if anything?
I'm guessing that somebody who works for you also works for The Poet.
And operates right here in Cheyenne.
What about that fellow outside?
Timberline? Ah, he's too stupid to scratch fleas.
You're barking up the wrong tree, Wylie.
We've checked everybody on the payroll and every move they've made for the past three years.
Then you better check up again.
Find somebody who married a girl from Colorado who follows them around.
Maybe it's one of your drivers.
Alright, I will.
Who gave you the tip?
I'd rather not say yet.
I might want to use them again.
I thought you went to South Fort.
Well, I started to, but a few miles out of town
I run into a lady riding this here cayuse.
I let the rest of the boys go on and I brung her back to town.
Where'd you leave her?
Miss. Kittredge's.
She was a good-lookin' gal.
But she had the dangdest ridin' clothes I ever seen on.
Listen, Durkin.
How'd you like to help me get The Poet?
The Poet?
Don't tell me he's in town.
I've got a strong hunch she is, and I'm gonna play it.
Are you game?
Well, well, sure.
If it don't take no gun work.
I don't wanna go shot and home to heaven.
I like it right here in Wyoming.
There won't be any gun work if we play it right.
Chances are he's carrying too much loot to get away with one horse.
There haven't been any stages out of town today.
He may try to make a break tonight.
Go to all the livery stables in town tell 'em not to rent out any more horses or rigs until further notice.
Alright, if you say so.
Say? What are you anyway?
- I clean forgot to ask you.
- No, I forgot to tell you.
Oh, hello, Jim.
Hello, brown eyes.
Somebody pass away in your family?
No. I got good news.
You remember that gentleman friend I told you about?
Yes.
Well, him and me are gonna get married.
Well, congratulations.
Now you can get rid of your little pistol.
Oh, maybe after the ceremony.
Going to give up your career?
Yep. He said a bar is no place for a lady.
Say, the boys are throwing me a farewell party tonight after the show.
Why don't you come by and help us celebrate?
- Thanks. Maybe I will.
- Good.
I'll be looking for you.
Goodbye.
Ed?
'Yes? Oh, just a minute.'
Ann, you shouldn't have come here.
I had to tell you what happened at South Fort.
Wait, Timberline's in there.
I've heard already.
Wylie came here and told me himself.
- He came here?
- Mm-hmm.
- Does he suspect anything?
- No.
But you're right about him.
He is a detective.
If that crazy Sundance hadn't held up the stage
'we could have kept Wylie out there for three or four days.'
Guess I could've. But would you have been here when I got back?
Now, don't be a child.
Of course I would.
Now, hurry back and pack your things.
We're leaving together first thing in the morning.
Then there's no hurry about it.
I've a lot of things to do here tonight.
Ed, you've always liked perfume, didn't you?
'Of course.
I like everything about you.'
'The jasmine, remember?'
How can I forget?
I never wore a cheap perfume in my life such as Lily of the Valley, for instance.
No, you never did.
Coming in from Fort Laramie the other day there was a woman on the stage that reeked of it.
Maybe she liked it.
Maybe she did.
She was a tough fuzzy-headed wench.
Built like a buffalo cow.
Why, you!
I thought that would flush you out.
Ed, she insulted me and you let her.
Nobody can talk to me like that.
Let me go.
So you were gonna take me away with you in the morning.
Oh-h, you!
Ann, Ann.
Tell it to her.
Wait a minute, darling.
You don't think I'd give you up for a woman like her.
Listen to me.
I'm just using her for a cover.
People see me with her, in that way they don't suspect there's anything between you and me.
Oh, you can't walk out of me now, Ann.
Not when everything's ready to pay off.
I'll get rid of her now.
Sure, you're good at that.
Like you're trying to get rid of me now.
That's not true, Ann.
And you know it.
Why would I have told you to come Cheyenne?
I promised you yesterday that this was the wind up.
That we're going to Frisco together.
When?
Tomorrow morning.
- What time?
- 8 o'clock.
You come here to the alley in the back.
I'll be waiting for you.
Alright, Ed.
I'll be here.
Could I trust you with a confidential matter?
Why, you certainly can.
I'm not one for talking.
Well, you know there's a black sheep in every family.
Oh, don't I know it?
I was married to one of 'em.
Do you know what he done to me in Salt Lake City once?
I was bending over buckling my shoes, and..
You know, I'll tell you about that later.
You go on.
It's my brother-in-law.
'Oh, they're the worst ones of all.'
Please don't say anything to my wife about this.
You know, in her delicate condition.
Oh, really?
Well. No, no.
Of course not.
He's made our life miserable.
Follows her everywhere, badgering her for money.
And right now, he's here in Cheyenne.
Oh.
He's smart enough to stay away from me.
But I thought maybe you'd seen him hanging around here.
Why, no.
No one's called on her.
What about tonight?
Did you get any messages?
Or tell you where she was going?
Never said a word.
Oh. Here she comes now.
Good evening, Ms. Kincaid.
I was just chatting with your husband.
He told me something very interesting about you.
'That'll make four, won't it?'
Jim never could keep a secret.
Coming in, dear?
You didn't come here to chat.
What did you want with her?
Never mind that.
What do you want with me?
Not a thing.
You're wrong about Sundance and me.
But you're right about my steering you out of town.
Go on.
I did it because I had faith in him and I don't anymore.
I'd like to go through with our deal.
- Nope.
- You still don't trust me.
After what happened to South Forks..
No.
Had even if I promised to give you the man you're looking for?
That might interest me.
What's the catch?
Let me get out of town.
Forget you ever knew me.
And give me your word you won't kill him.
It's no deal.
There's still a joker in it somewhere.
Don't be stupid.
I'm the only chance you've got.
It's like throwing $20,000 right out the window.
I'll get it.
But I'll get it my way.
If there's a bonus for you, maybe I'll get that too.
Go ahead and try it alone.
You don't know him.
But maybe he knows you.
Tell you,
I can't do nothing about it.
- Oh, pop.
- Go on. Get out of here.
Go play post office.
Have any troubles, pop?
Oh, can't rent nobody no buggy teen tonight.
The sheriff told me not to.
Yeah, I know.
Got a room to stable this horse?
Oh, I reckon so.
For how long?
I don't know.
He doesn't belong to me.
Well, then who's gonna pay for his keep?
That's up to your friend, the sheriff.
- He'll take care of that.
- Hmm.
Anybody else try to rent a horse from you tonight?
Not a soul.
Business is bad enough without the government given orders.
But these here cayuses keep eating their heads off whether they're working or not.
What's the matter with the colt?
Oh, he misses his mother.
I sold her this afternoon.
I didn't wanna sell her.
The young lady that bought her, didn't want no colt.
- Who was the young lady?
- I don't know.
She didn't give me her name.
I...I told her that she was a getting a pretty lively horse for her to handle, but she said she was buying it for somebody else.
What did she look like?
Oh, she was good-looker, alright.
Smart little horse-trader too.
Did you ever see her before?
No.
Oh, yeah, I did..
...come to think of it,
I seen her getting off the Laramie stage the other day.
Well, you was there.
I seen you talking to her.
That's right, but there were two of them.
Which one do you mean?
Two? I didn't see but one.
Shut up.
Nice-looking little fella.
Hmm, fair.
I got a ranch up in Montana.
Might be able to use this colt.
What do you take for him?
Ten dollars, and he's your own, mister.
I'm sick and tired of his bellowing.
That's a deal.
When I was weaned,
I took it like a man but this darn colt hollers his head off.
'Then we found the bodies of Sundance's gang'
'right where this fellow
Wylie told Fred they would be.'
And a few miles beyond South Fork we come across what was left of the stage coach.
The driver, the shotgun guard, and passengers were all dead.
Just boxes laying there.
Split wide open and bone dry.
When Wylie first reported this to you, what else did he say?
Well, he didn't say nothing else.
Only later when I ask him who he was, he wouldn't tell me.
So you just let him walk right away without even trying to stop him.
Well, he didn't look like a man who'd stop easy.
Anyway, I've retired.
I ain't gonna get in no more shooting fracases.
Huh, name one you ever was in?
He's got plenty of brass this Wylie whoever he is.
He came in here too, told me a big cock and bull story.
But he forgot to mention the
$10,000 that was in this box.
Yeah.
He didn't mention that, did he?
The only other thing he told me to do was to tell all the livery stable owners not to rent any more horses tonight. And I don't know why.
Dumb stupid jackass, because he intends to pull out of here himself tonight and doesn't want to be followed.
That puts the clincher on it.
I believe Wylie's The Poet.
And I'll make you a bet.
When he's caught, you'll find the proof of it on it.
But if he didn't pull this job, Ed why would he come back to town to say anything?
What smarter way is there to throw us off the track?
We're not dealing with any dumb petty crook like Sundance.
This fellow has been thumbing his nose at Wells Fargo for years.
How big a reward you think we have up for him?
Dead or alive?
- How big is it?
- Thousands.
Ten, maybe twenty by this time.
Why don't you go out and grab it?
Why don't you?
I'm not a peace officer.
That's your line.
So go and get him.
Well, don't rush me.
I'm...I'm thinking.
- Well..
- Alright.
Well, I wouldn't come out of retirement for no less that 10,000.
It's gonna be a big surprise to Webb Yancey when he gets in tomorrow.
Yancey? Tomorrow?
Who told you that?
I put the letter on your desk, Mr. Landers.
It come in this morning.
You can go now.
I'll close up.
Well, run across anything yet?
I think so. I'm not sure.
Someone in here?
If I'm guessing right, yes.
Come on inside, have a drink with me. You can see better.
No, thanks, I can see what I'm watching from here.
Well, if you need me, let me know.

No, siree, Sundance and his boys wasn't dead at all.
Just winged, I had to kill 'em over again.
There I was single-handed.
- Durkin.
- Oh-h!
Oh, Mr. Landers, don't never do that.
I'm nervous enough as it is.
If you're still looking for
Wylie, he's standing back there.
- Back-back where?
- Backstage by the alley door.
- Are you s-sure?
- Sure, go get him.
Keep that box upfront with you.
Yes, sir.
Yes, ma'am?
What can I do for you?
When does the next stage leave for Laramie or Denver?
Why, there are lots of directions, ma'am.
Which one do you want to go to?
Oh, I don't much care.
Which one goes out first?
Well, we're loading for Laramie now.
'We'll be pulling out shortly.'
'The next stage to Denver leaves in the morning.'
That's not a Wells Fargo box.
Where did it come from?
The ticket agent gave it to us.
It's a Russell, Majors, and Waddell shipment.
Green bag's going to a bank in Frisco.
But they've always sent their money through me.
What's the matter, don't they trust Wills Fargo anymore?
Well, I wouldn't know about that, Mr. Landers.
Put these two bags in there too.
They belong to one of the passengers.
Yes, sir. So far there's only one that's going.
Give me a ticket on the stage that's leaving now.
Yes, ma'am.
Oh, uh, what about your baggage?
It's already been put on.
Hello, Ed.
Everything's all set.
Here's your ticket.
You'll have the stage all to yourself.
What do you mean all of myself?
Aren't you going with me?
Of course I am. But some last minute business just came up.
What kind of business?
That dame from Denver?
No, no, this is with a man.
Now ride along, honey, and get in the stage.
I have a fast horse. I'll catch up with you at Corlett.
Alright, Ed. Bye.
Put 'em up, Wylie.
What've you been drinking, moonshine?
Stop talkin' and turn around.
You're under arrest.
Quit waving that gun around, will you?
Those things go off too easy.
Hmm, you ought to know.
You are The Poet.
Now, please walk out in the alley and walk slow.
Who put you up to this?
Nobody, I guess I know a holdup man when I see one.
You thought you fooled me, didn't you?
Durkin! Watch out!
If you're going to Denver, sister, you're in the wrong pew.
Oh, is this your private coach, Cinderella?
You bet it is. Get out.
Well, this looks like where we came in, doesn't it?
Hello, Jim.
Yeah, don't it though.
What happened to your Prince Charming?
Didn't he show up?
If it's any of your business
Ed's gonna join me later tonight.
'We're getting married.
Take a look at that.'
I've seen it before, thank you.
Be sure not to drop it, you'll have seven years bad luck.
Ed who is gonna meet you later tonight?
Ed Landers.
I told you about him, remember?
Yes, all but the name.
And what's your last name, dear?
Your married name. I forget.
Get in. If you're getting in, we're about to get off.
Yes.
You can never tell what might happen with two ladies traveling alone.
So, you were married all the time and chasing my man.
Well, how do you like that?
I don't mind.
I've been chasing one myself.
'Hey, Nelly! Hey.'
Where is it you're gonna meet Mr. Landers?
At Corlett.
That's where we're gonna be married.
How long have you known him?
Only a couple of months.
That ain't long, but like Ed says, "You're only young once."
Once is enough.
I went on a honeymoon trip not long ago.
The place was full of rats.
'How'd your wife stand it?'
Well, she didn't seem to mind.
She even used to keep one around as a pet.
Big pack rat.
Till one night he ran away with a canary.
Now what would the rat want with the canary?
You'll find out.
'I wasn't asking you.'
I know. Just remembered.
Say, Jimmy..
...what about you being best man for Ed?
Would you, as a favor?
- I'd be glad to.
- Good.
Ho!
Ho!
There he is. That's The Poet.
But remember, I seen him first.
You keep out of this,
Durkin, we're gonna hang him right here now.
What do they mean,
He's The Poet?
Wait and see. You've got some more surprises coming.
Ha!
Stick 'em up.
Hey. What is this?
Throw that strongbox off and get down.
Well, that sounds like Ed.
What's the idea, Landers?
- Ain't you a lil' mixed up?
- Not a bit.
Walk out the road.
- What are you going to do?
- Start walking.
Of all the low down murderin' thieves.
Drop your gun.
Alright, get up the hill.
What a setup.
The inspector himself, robbing the company blind.
- Ed..
- You better stay out of this.
'Get in. I'm taking you back.'
- Ed!
- Don't make a move, Wylie.
'Let go of that gun.'
I'll get it, Ed.
I've been waiting for this.
Stand aside, Ann.
Don't be a fool.
Yes, I've been one long enough.
You've lied to me all along.
I'm warning you, Ann.
I'm gonna shoot.
Go ahead.
We'll shoot together.
You don't deserve this, Ed, but I'm going to give you one last chance.
Get on that horse and get out of here as far as it can take you.
Ed!
'Here comes the Cheyenne Stage.'
Oh, maybe there's somebody who can help you, Ed.
Not if it's who I think it is.
Driver.
What's the matter, here?
- We had a little trouble.
- A little trouble?
Ed Landers held us up.
He shot Eddie, the guard and was going to shoot me too but this fella got in first.
That's your Poet, Yancey.
So that's how it was?
Yeah, it all adds up now.
Nobody else could have done it.
Well, what are you standin' here talkin' for?
Can't you see he's badly hurt?
We got to get him back to Cheyenne.
Don't worry, lady, we'll get him back.
Put him in a coach, Murrow.
What are you going to do with him?
If he get's out of this alive..
...we'll hang him.
I'm sorry I had to mess up your wedding, brown eyes.
Here's his gun.
I'm going to Laramie, and wait for you there.
What for?
- The reward.
- Reward?
- You didn't earn it yet.
- What do you mean?
We made a deal.
You said, as soon as I got him--
Oh, you got him, alright, but what about the money he stole?
Did you locate that?
- That wasn't in the deal.
- Oh, yes, it was.
Sixty thousand.
And when you find it, twenty of it is yours.
Hyah! Hyah!
Driver, will you please get my bags out of the booth and put 'em inside?
Yes.
You're not fooling me with this trip to Laramie.
If that's where you're going?
What business is it of yours where I go?
Just this much..
...you know where Landers hid the money he stole.
When they put him away, you'll come back for it.
That's why
I was stayin' in Cheyenne.
I'll be there, waiting for you.
Well, thatjust suits me perfectly.
Because I don't know, and
I don't care where the money is.
And if I never see you again that's soon enough.
Anything else you'd like to know?
Yes.
There's just one more thing
I'm curious about.
That's it.
You know, Annie,
I can't figure it out.
You're half devil and half angel.
Most women are, Jim.
That's the sugar in the coffee.
But I like both of them straight.
So get in the coach and keep moving.
That's something to remember me by.
'Hey, Nelly, come on!'
'Hey!'
IRBY:
Close that door.
Vance.
Lock it.
Why did you risk coming here?
Bradford's downstairs now looking for you.
Yes, I saw him. He found the hideout. Every street leading out of town is blocked...
...with soldiers but we're going tomorrow night and the gold is going with us.
But how can we?
Remember Murrell, the outlaw?
I made a deal with him.
His gang is camped a few miles from here.
Between 2 and 3 tomorrow night, they'll attack the garrison.
That'll draw every soldier out of Virginia City.
When they arrive, we slip out of town with the four wagons.
The others will be up in Box Canyon waiting for us.
Waiting for us?
But you can't stay here now, Julia.
Or would you rather stay?
Why, I have nothing to stay for, Vance.
Of course I'm going with you.
There's just one other thing left to be done, Julia...
...but it's the most important, and you are the only one who can do it.
What is it, Vance?
Get in touch with Bradford, tell him you know where I'm hiding and send him to me.
Send him to you? What for?
He's the one man in Virginia City who could stop us.
The moment he saw us start, he'd arouse a posse to grab us and the gold.
The only way to stop that is to grab him first.
What are you going to do with him,
Vance?
I don't know yet.
You're going to kill him, aren't you?
Of course you are.
You couldn't afford to leave him here alive, he knows too much about us.
So I must lead him quietly and unsuspecting to his death because I'm a woman.
That's something only a woman could do.
Why, all of this was your idea, Julia.
Taking the gold from here.
Remember the look on Jefferson Davis' face when he said:
"We are very proud of you and deeply grateful"?
I remember.
"And the hopes of 10 million of us will be riding with you."
I remember.
That's why your decision right now is so important.
Oh, but why must I be the one, Vance?
Can't you see this is murder?
It's even worse than murder,
Kerry trusts me.
And what about those who are trusting us?
When these people leave with their children...
...they're turning their backs on their homes.
Some of them are facing death and they know it, but not one hesitates.
Yes.
I know what this means to you, Julia...
...but there's no alternative, you are the only one who can do it.
What shall I tell him?
Now, listen...
All right, we'll spread out from here.
Moose, you take the north section.
You men check everything up that way.
Come on, Marble, we'll look around here.
By golly. Ain't a man got time to get a little grog around here?
You're groggy enough, partner. Wait here.
How do you do? I understand this is a boarding house, is that correct?
- We're filled up.
- Well, thanks. I wasn't looking for a room...
...I was looking for a boarder.
Mind telling me who your guests are?
That's their business. I never ask them.
- Well, would you mind if I looked around?
- You can take a look at this.
I'll have no yellow-livered Yankee in my house unless it's a dead one.
And I got a twitchy finger, so get.
Well, do you still want to argue?
No, ma'am. I never argue with women.
And certainly not a woman with a gun.
I'd do something for that twitchy finger if I were you...
...it even makes me nervous. Good day.
So the Union forces retreat, huh?
Yes, sir. The third battle of Bull Run.
MAN: Hey, come back here, you little ragamuffin.
Here he is, sergeant.
COBBY:
Let me go.
- Answer my questions and I'll let you go.
- I can't tell you anything.
You know every rebel in town, you run errands for them. Where's Irby?
- I don't know and I wouldn't tell if I did.
SERGEANT: You're lying.
- I'll wail that tar out if you don't talk.
COBBY: Go ahead, you're big enough.
Hold on, sergeant. Let the kid alone.
- Yes, but...
- I said, let him alone.
Come on, partner.
We're not fishing for Southerners your size.
Yeah, well, I was fishing for you.
- Miss Julia sent me to find you.
- She did?
- What are you fellas butting in for?
- What?
If I had my way, I'd whip that little copperhead until he couldn't stand up.
If you don't find her on the stage, you'll find her in her dressing room.
I see.
- Thanks. Here's something for your trouble.
- No, thanks, I don't want it.
Hey, you don't like Yankees much, do you?
No, I don't.
Well, I think I know how you feel.
When I was a boy in Ireland,
I felt the same way about Englishmen.
But you can change.
Well, thanks all the same.
So long.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
Come in.
- Darling, did you send for me?
- Yes.
- The boy said it was urgent.
- It is.
Come over here, Kerry, and sit down by me.
What is it?
Oh, I'm worried about you.
Half of Virginia City knows who you are and why you're here.
Why didn't you tell me?
Well, it's part of my job not to talk too much.
- I would have told you at the right time.
- Oh, there'll never be a right time.
I know these Southern people,
I've lived among them.
They'll kill you before they'd give up their gold.
You can hardly blame them for trying.
But they're gonna have to improve their aim first.
You mustn't go on with the search.
Please. For my sake.
But I must go on with it.
This job's gotta be finished.
But what can you, one man, hope to accomplish against hundreds?
You can't stop them, Kerry, the whole Union Army can't stop them.
I love you, darling.
I'm so afraid for you.
I love you too, Julia.
But I won't run out and leave them a clear field here.
I couldn't do it. Don't you see?
This means too much to too many people.
Does it mean more than...?
Than you and me?
It's the only thing that does.
All right, if that's your decision.
I'm sorry, darling.
I want to help you.
I can tell you where to find their leader.
- Who? Irby?
- Yes.
He's in love with one of the girls here.
She saw him less than an hour ago.
- Where is she? Where can I talk to her?
- She'd be afraid to talk to you.
She said that Irby's ready to make a deal, give himself up tonight if you come alone.
- Then he must know he's beaten.
- Yes.
Where is he?
There will be someone here tonight to take you to him.
I see.
How do you know you can trust that girl?
She wouldn't lie to me.
She knows I love you and what your life means to me.
Darling, that's enough for me.
Goodbye.
Tell Carson City to watch the south road, stop all travelers, hold for identification...
[GUNSHOTS]
- What happened?
- It's a raid. About 50 of them.
- We don't know who they are.
- Looks like Murrell and his men.
Close the gates, mount the parapets, a hundred rounds to each man.
We only have a skeleton force, the rest are on patrol.
Burke, go and get them, bring them back as fast as you can.
Lieutenant, assemble what men we have.
We'll hold them off until the reinforcements come.
Wayne...
- There it is.
- Oh, wait a minute.
Well, what are you two bloodhounds trailing me around for?
We wasn't trailing you.
We was kind of moseying around sort of accidental like and here we are.
- I don't need you, get out of here.
- We thought it would...
- Sure. You know, just in case...
- Oh.
All right, wait here.
I'll be back in 15 minutes.
Here it is, sir.
The door's unlocked, he's in there waiting for you.
Oh, thanks.
Irby?
- You alone, Bradford?
- Yes.
I got your message.
What is it you want?
There isn't much I can expect, is there?
Not much more than you gave me in Libby Prison.
So now you're gonna collect for that tunnel?
I'm gonna have to collect much more than that, Irby.
There can be no deal before you, your friends and their gold...
...have been put safely away until this war's over.
Even then I can't guarantee that they won't hang you as a spy.
You Yanks always did drive a hard bargain.
But this time I have an idea we're going to trade on my terms.
Really? What might they be?
I prefer your company to your life, captain.
I had quite an argument about that with my friends, but I finally won out.
Don't move your hands and turn slowly.
I hated to do it this way, but you had to know sometime...
...and tonight you moved a little too fast for us.
You're going back home with us, an escaped prisoner of the Confederacy...
...back to Libby to lower-west and the sentence you ran away from.
I see.
Well, this was a very clever little trap.
Some consolation to think
I'm not the first man...
...who was ever fooled by a woman.
But you haven't got a chance of getting out of this town, Irby.
There's a squad of cavalry on every corner and they'd shoot you down on sight.
I only came here to give you a chance.
[HORN BLOWS FANFARE]
I took my chance and we won't have to wait much longer.
Fall in. Column of twos.
Back to the garrison.
Tie him up, we gotta move fast.
Bring him along.
Where do you suppose they're off to?
Hey, ain't them 15 minutes about up?
- They sure are.
- Well...
- Kerry!
- Hey, Kerry!
- Kerry!
- Hey!
[DOORKNOB RATTLES]
It's locked.
Kerry.
- Kerry. Hey, Kerry.
- Kerry.
- Kerr...
- Well, he ain't here.
You don't reckon that sawbones operated on Kerry, do you?
What are you talking about?
MAN 1:
Boys, we're ready.
MAN 2:
Wagons, forward!
Watch your wheels, boys, sandy territory ahead.
Bradford, I'll make a bargain with you.
From now on, it's gonna be a rough trail and hard riding.
If you give me your word you won't escape, I'll untie you.
Well, thanks, Irby.
I think we'd better leave things the way they are.
I don't wanna make a promise that I might not be able to keep.
Suit yourself.
Kerry.
I'm sorry this had to happen.
Sorry? What for?
Everything turned out the way you planned it, didn't it?
It was the last thing in the world
I wanted to do.
Well, you're the only one in the world who could have done it.
Boy, if your smeller can pick out a wagon track on them rocks...
...you ought to have been born a bloodhound.
Shucks, I can trace a fly across that dirty neck of yours.
Look.
Come here.
Well, them sure ain't rabbit tracks.
Be dadgummed if them ain't wheel tracks.
Yes, sir, and that's the way we're heading.
- Well, I don't know.
- Well, I do know.
This way of passing, they must be ahead of us.
What makes you so confounded certain he's with that outfit?
If he ain't with them, he's after them.
Did you know Kerry to turn aside from something he started after?
No, but you...
Marblehead,
I only made one mistake in my life...
...and that was when I started letting you follow after me.
- Come on.
- Well, let's get to riding.
Wagons, ho.
Nice work, Murrell.
- Did you lose any men?
- Oh, maybe five or six.
Big party you got here.
Yeah.
Here it is, Murrell. All ready for you.
Pretty big price you pay to get this wagon train out of Virginia City.
Not when you're anxious to get home.
MURRELL: Which way you heading?
IRBY: Due south.
MURRELL: Yeah, that's the best way.
Better you cut west this side of Las Vegas.
Then you miss the Union outpost at Mormon Station.
You cross the Colorado River at...
Yeah.
Just like I said...
...you cross the river at Sloan's Ferry.
The water, she's low this time of year.
Maybe you like
I ride a little ways with you, huh?
- No, thanks.
- Well, good luck.
Maybe I see you sometime.
That was a good tip about circling Mormon Station.
A little too good.
But we're taking no chances with Mr. Murrell.
Wagons, forward.
Sergeant, wagon train coming.
If only our luck holds out.
Marshall, you and Armistead ride back...
...and tell the boys to act natural and keep Bradford out of sight.
SERGEANT:
Pull up.
Pull up, everybody.
Hello, sergeant.
- Hi.
MAN 1: Pull up, everybody.
MAN 2:
Hold back, boys. Hold back.
Where'd you folks come from?
All the way from Kansas, heading for California.
Is this the right road?
It might be.
What do you got in that wagon?
Oh, some grub, a few pieces of furniture and a lot of tired people.
SERGEANT: Well, you got a long pull ahead of you.
You'll find some mighty dry country.
Excuse me, folks.
- And that one?
- Same as the rest, we're settlers.
You're welcome to look, but I assure you there's nothing there to interest the Army.
All right, go ahead.
Thanks, sergeant.
Wagons, forward!
Hold on a minute.
- Pull up, you men.
- Hold those wagons.
IRBY:
Any trouble, sergeant?
What makes these wagons sink so deep?
You ain't declared that hefty a load.
Why, it's the wagon itself.
Besides, your country's pretty sandy.
Maybe, but I'm gonna have a look just the same.
All right, everybody, get out of those wagons.
Come on, you too.
We're unloading everything.
MAN: Come on, get moving.
Get those wagons out.
He can't get far. Come on.
Cobby.
That's the last of him.
Go back to the wagons and keep rolling.
[TELEGRAPH TAPPING]
[TELEGRAPH TAPPING]
- Mormon Station, sir.
- Yeah?
"Gold train...
...passed through here...
...after killing guard.
Send force immediately...
...equipped for long..."
Well?
Something's happened, sir.
Push them hands up and reach for the roof.
Doggone it.
Say, you're sure getting so you play rough.
You knowed that was me.
- What do you mean trying to scare us?
- Well, I'm sorry, fellas.
I had no idea it was you until you fell on your faces.
Well, that's a fine welcome.
It would have served you right if I'd plugged you.
Where have you been?
- What took you so long?
- We been following...
What do you mean wandering around like a couple of strays?
Do I have to put bells on you to find out where you are?
- Well, l...
- Be quiet.
I can't depend on you any longer,
I can see that.
Serve you right if I knocked your bone-heads together.
- Oh, Kerry, it sure is good to see you.
- You bet.
My, how you two have grown.
- How'd you find me?
- We got a couple of good smellers.
- I'll say you have.
- We followed your trail. What's this?
MARBLEHEAD:
Somebody's been cutting up around here.
BRADFORD:
That's the gold train.
- Boy, I'm sure glad you're all together.
- I'm only just.
[TELEGRAPH TAPPING]
It's coming through now, sir.
"Will wait...
...here for you.
Captain Bradford."
- Order the assembly.
- Yes, sir.
Intelligence Department. Bradford.
- You drivers all set?
- We're all ready.
After you cross the river, turn toward Mojave City.
Should make fast time with these wagons, but be sure and leave a clear trail.
Good luck, boys. Now, get going.
Hurry, we gotta catch those wagons before they leave the river.
Right, Vance.
All right, folks, we're moving.
If we move the boy another mile, it might kill him.
If we don't move on, it may be all of us.
Won't you let us rest here today, Vance, for a few hours?
We can't chance it, Julia.
Sorry, Cobby, we can't stand by and let you rest.
I'll be all right.
Just keep on moving, Vance.
All right, we'll put him in the wagon.
Murrell said there was nothing to worry about after Sloan's Crossing.
I said I don't trust Murrell.
I'm dividing the train.
We don't know who's behind us or how close, so let's hurry.
All right, Vance.
All right, keep your wagons close together till we get to the middle of the river.
Whoa.
- This is evidently where they camped.
- Dad-burned if it ain't.
There are the tracks where they crossed the river.
We'll pick them up on the other side.
There's where they went out.
And they headed due south.
It couldn't be plainer if they'd left a map.
That's just it, sir.
How far can you trust that map?
They knew they were being followed.
Be the easiest thing in the world to cover those tracks up.
- Lf you want my opinion...
- I'd ask for it.
You saw the trail where they went in.
And this is where they went out.
I should think even an Intelligence officer would see that.
MAN:
Forward, ho.
COBBY: Julia, how much farther do we have to go?
Not far, Cobby.
We're almost there.
Shh. Don't try to talk.
You go back to sleep.
My stomach.
Wagons ahead, sir.
Whoa.
There are only four wagons, you told me there were 10.
There are still 10.
[MARBLEHEAD CLEARS THRO AT]
Ho!
There ain't nothing in this one.
It's emptier than his head.
Doggone, thunderation.
Major, the confounding stuff sure ain't in there.
Bradford, if this idea of yours turns out to be a wild-goose chase...
These wagons are just decoys, sir.
They purposely led us off the trail.
Loaded the gold into the other six...
...they must be ahead of us, either south or southeast.
Well, how about the north and the west?
We haven't tried them yet.
Since we don't seem to agree...
...I wonder if you'd mind if I took men and followed my hunch?
You could divide the rest up into patrols and spread out.
- We could rendezvous at Sloan's Crossing.
- Well, all right.
But I hope your hunch turns out to be a good one, for your sake.
Thank you, sir. I do too.
Walton and five men, join Captain Bradford.
Lieutenant, call the troops.
Circle in.
We're camping here.
Circle in.
His pulse is very weak.
Let me.
He needs fresh water, Vance.
So do the rest of us.
We'll make the water hole tomorrow if we're lucky.
There's the river. Water.
MAN:
This is the river we hoped for.
Mud.
How far to the next stream, Vance?
If this one's dry, they all are.
We mustn't let the others know.
Means too much to them.
We'll tell them it's a mistake, that this isn't the place.
We haven't reached it yet.
You go back to the wagons, John, and tell them.
Come on.
Go back to your wagons, men.
There's been a mistake.
I'm afraid we'll have to go further on.
I want to talk.
I know what you've been going through.
It's worse for you than the rest. You've got the responsibility of all these people.
I've got a job to do.
I know.
They've been through so much already, all of them.
Julia, you don't regret anything, do you?
Regret?
- What do you mean?
- You've changed.
You've been different ever since...
Tell me, what's on your mind?
Oh, it's just these people, they can't go on.
- We can't make them, Vance, it's inhuman.
- War is inhuman, Julia.
We're going on, just as long as we have the strength to go on.
How many days will that be without food and water? Two, maybe three?
There's nothing but desert between here and Texas.
That doesn't matter.
We're just a few. Thousands will suffer if we fail. We gotta get through.
Come on, Julia, we're moving. Come on.
MOOSE:
"Cobby Gill, age 11."
It must have been pretty tough for him.
For one of them, especially.
You sure was right about that gold train, Kerry.
That's the way they're headed, all right.
Walton, Brown.
- Yes, sir.
- Ride back to Major Drewery's camp.
- Tell him to follow us as quickly as he can.
- Yes, sir.
They started out with 10 wagons, now they only have four.
Whatever money they got is in those four, that's a cinch.
I figured we'd run onto them about here.
You figured? Didn't I tell you?
Yes, I've often wondered what I'd do without you two.
You see?
Who's that?
Dismount.
MARBLEHEAD:
I'll be doggoned.
Take these horses and keep them out of sight.
Tarnation.
That bunch is all tired. Wore out.
Maybe we give them little surprise, huh?
The rest of you stay here and keep them covered.
MAN: Bed down your horses and start your fires.
WOMAN:
Watch the children.
Hold on, Murrell.
- Hello.
- What do you want here?
I have some business to talk with Irby.
He's finished his business with you.
Maybe he thinks so, but not me.
For the fine service I have given him, two little bags of gold is not enough.
You named your price and we paid it.
Now, get out of here.
I think maybe you tell Irby
I want to talk with him, huh?
It's Murrell.
[GUNFIRE]
Doggone, tarnation.
It's the Yank, Bradford.
Hold your fire, men. Let them come in.
Don't shoot at them. Hold your fire.
- Thanks, Irby.
- Forget it.
This turned into a pretty good fracas.
Yeah.
How'd you learn to wing-shoot?
In Afghanistan, the kids do it.
- How much ammunition have you got?
- Plenty.
Vance!
- Oh, Vance.
- Let's get his shirt open.
Yes.
That's a bad one. Dr. Cameron?
IRBY: Bradford?
- Yes.
You take command, will you?
- Right. Don't worry.
- Yes.
Get him comfortable, doctor.
CAMERON: We'll get him on a cot.
- Vance.
- That's right.
- Julia.
Come over here. Follow me, quick.
Come on.
Now, line up shoulder to shoulder.
Now, hold your fire.
And when they get close, let them have a little volley.
All right.
If I ever get my hands on that cow-hided Murrell again...
...l'll make him squall like a mashed cat.
BRADFORD:
Once more.
Now, we hold off until daylight.
And when the sun comes up, we finish off this wagon train pretty quick.
Better build that barricade higher.
Get a little sleep if you can, Vance.
Thanks, doc.
Too bad, Irby.
I'm sorry.
I was hoping you'd come.
What's our chance of holding out?
Not much, frankly.
As soon as daylight comes they'll be down on us again.
Our only hope's Drewery.
When?
Tomorrow, maybe. Maybe not for days.
About the gold...
It's cost us so much.
If any of us gets through...
...l'd like it to do some good.
So would l, but that's not up to me.
What happens to the gold, that's out of my hands.
No, it isn't.
It was your job to get us and you did it.
Anyway, the South can't win now, but the gold still belongs to our people.
After the war, they'll need it to help thousands like them throughout the South.
I thought because of Julia, you might...
I told you, whatever happens to the gold is not up to me.
I promise you one thing, though.
Murrell won't get it.
But if Drewery...
That's all I can promise.
Where is it?
Under the floorboards of the wagons.
Right.
Too bad you and I had to be on opposite sides of the fence in this.
I think we might have been friends.
Thanks.
Marble.
Moose.
How is he?
How's Irby?
Oh, he's pretty bad, poor fella.
I don't think he'll make it.
- He told me where the gold is.
- Where?
- Under the floorboards of the wagons.
- Well, I'll be.
Look, get every able-bodied men in camp.
Get all of that gold into the first wagon there.
And speed it up, we've only got two hours till dawn.
Boys, come on.
You two men go with them.
- Dr. Cameron?
- Yes, what is it?
- How much gunpowder have we got?
- Kegs of it.
Get out two kegs and a length of fuse.
- What are you trying to do?
- We're moving the gold.
What for? What are you gonna do with it?
I haven't time for explanations now.
CAMERON: So you're taking the gold and running out on us?
- I'm afraid I misjudged you, Bradford.
- Did you?
Well, look, doctor, you take care of the wounded...
...and I'll worry about the rest, huh?
Come on. Here, hitch this horse up.
- Who told you where the gold was?
- Irby.
- You'd better go to him, Julia.
- Vance wouldn't trust you.
You've tricked him and now you plan to use us to take what's still ours.
Oh, I'd rather Murrell got it than the North.
I don't use those people who trust me.
In any case, this time tomorrow none of us will care who has the gold or where it is...
...because we probably won't be alive.
There'll be a certain rough justice about that.
What do you know about justice?
What do you know...?
I'm sorry we don't understand each other,
Julia.
- Come on.
MOOSE: We're all loaded, Kerry.
BRADFORD:
All right, Marble, you take the lines.
Now, the rest of you men, get on those wheels and start the load rolling.
Don't let her sink in the sand. Come on.
Bring the wagon nearer, close under that ledge as possible.
Now, unhitch the horses and get them out of there.
Right, one more keg.
Now, the fuse.
There it is. Come on.
Doggone scissor-bills, here they come again.
Thicker than hair on a dog's back.
I got him for you, Yank.
Father.
Father.
Why, you...
You dirty rat.
I'll kill you. I'll kill you.
They killed him. They killed him.
Think it's gonna rain?
It always does.
Here. Hold this.
Follow me...
They ain't shooting. Watch them fall.
Vance.
[MUMBLING]
DREWERY:
How many men did you lose?
What you see here is all that's left, sir.
DREWERY:
Is the gold safe?
Well, where is it? Let's have a look at it.
There isn't any gold.
DREWERY: Is this your idea of a joke,
Bradford? Answer my question.
Have you searched the wagons?
I told you, sir, there isn't any gold.
Why, that's absurd.
Do you think I followed you hundreds of miles to believe this lie?
What have you done with it?
Who are you holding it for?
Just a minute, Bradford.
Yes, sir.
You're under arrest.
Get your belongings together, we're taking you back to Virginia City.
It is the verdict of this court martial...
...that you seized and withheld contraband of war for private reasons...
...and are therefore guilty of high treason.
Before final sentence is passed...
...is there anything else you wish to say in your defense?
Yes, sir, there is something I'd like to add.
It's true I took the gold...
...and I'm the only one responsible for taking it...
...but not for the reasons the court infers.
The court is willing to consider any reason...
...consistent with your obligations as a soldier.
There are some things that aren't covered by the military code, sir.
This was one of them.
You came here, not as a private citizen...
...but as an officer with an official duty to perform.
And I performed it, to the best of my ability.
My job was to see that the gold didn't reach the South.
I knew that if it did, it'd prolong the war.
The gold did not reach the South.
That was not enough.
It was also your duty to hand it over as contraband to your government.
That's true, sir.
I had a choice to make...
...a choice between doing my duty as a soldier or as a man.
Well, I made that choice. I couldn't very well have done anything else...
...after I saw what those people went through...
...for a cause they believed to be right.
And what has this to do with you?
Their leader hoped that someday that gold would still return to the South...
...where it belonged, to help them rebuild their homes and restore some of their pride.
Continue.
I don't think I can explain it any better than that, sir.
Except that I believe
I'm doing the right thing.
That's why I refused to deliver the gold.
That's why I still refuse.
Captain Bradford, that's your final decision?
Yes, it is, sir.
It is the sentence of this court martial...
...that you shall be executed on the morning of April the 9th, 1865...
...in the usual manner at the usual time prescribed by regulations.
JULIA: l... I can't tell you...
I've no words to...
Oh, I'm so deeply grateful for this audience.
I know how busy you are, Mr. President.
I was afraid you wouldn't see me, because I'm a Virginian.
Why, I've got a lot of friends down south,
Miss Hayne...
...and more relatives in Virginia than a Blue Ridge rabbit.
I've sort of missed them these last four years.
Mr. President, the execution is set for tomorrow.
That's less than six hours in Nevada.
I've been studying the minutes of the court martial, Miss Hayne.
According to military code, there's no question of Bradford's guilt.
I know that, I heard them say so.
I was there.
Oh, but I beg you, Mr. President...
...judge him as a man and not by military code.
He mustn't... He can't be killed.
I'm not a military man, my child.
He won't be killed.
Thank God that the killing is over.
Your General Lee is meeting our General Grant tomorrow...
...at a place called Appomattox
Court House to discuss the terms of peace.
Then we've lost?
Not lost, found.
They're coming back, back in the Union.
Miss Hayne, you came over 2000 miles...
...to save the life of a man who was once your enemy.
I think, very likely, you're in love with him.
Well, to me, you two are symbols of what I hope we can do for our country.
Mr. Lincoln,
I didn't know you were like this.
I want to tell them in Virginia, everywhere.
Yes, tell them we're not enemies, but friends.
That in my heart and in thousands like mine throughout America...
...there is no spirit of revenge in our victory.
There must be no harbor of hatred in their defeat.
Tell them we are now one people, united by blood and fire.
And that from this day forward, 
our destiny is indivisible. 
With malice toward none, 
with charity for all. 
With firmness in the right
as God gives us to see the right. 
Let us now strive
to bind up the nation's wounds. 
To do all which may achieve
and cherish a just and lasting peace... 
... among ourselves and with all nations. 
[ENGLISH SDH]
We've lost him. You, men, head south.
We'll take the stage-coach trail.
What's the matter with you, Spider?
Whoa, boy.
Well, Spider, old boy.
I hate to part company but... it's you or me.
Howdy, stranger.
Sorry, but I'm gonna have to borrow your horse for a spell.
I reckon I'd better borrow your gun, too.
Where does it hurt most?
My ankle.
Here and here.
Busted rib. Somebody put the boot to you, huh?
Horse fell on me.
Take it easy.
Sit down.
Let's roll up your shirt.
Raise your hands over your head.
Feel better?
Much. Thanks.
Let's get outta here.
Well, why don't you say what you're thinking?
I'm not thinking anything.
Come on.
Take a chew of this. It'll help you keep your mind off the pain.
Thanks.
Come on.
Me, a Santa Claus.
-What's that?
-Nothing, nothing at all.
This is the stage depot.
They'll take care of you.
I'll still need your horse.
You're welcome to it, and anything else I have.
Forget it.
What's going on here?
Don't look like one of them, does he?
I never seen this fellow before.
-What do you want?
-What's your name, stranger?
-Edward Creighton.
-What you doing here?
-Surveyor.
-Surveyor?
Yes, I work for Western Union.
-What's Western Union?
-A telegraph company.
We're going through here next year on our way to the coast.
I guess he's all right.
Anything wrong?
We had a bank holdup at North Platte today.
We killed one of them and the rest of them scattered.
Looks like we've lost them, now for good.
-She's here, Mr. Creighton.
-Oh, good.
Are you ready?
I think so, Bert.
Now if I can just manage to navigate on these things, Bert.
I reckon you'll be back this way with that telegraph line before long.
If everything goes right, I will.
I do a little trapping now and then so I was wondering... how much it would cost to send my pelts into Omaha by telegraph.
You can't send pelts by telegraph,
Bert.
-You can't?
-No. All you can send is writing.
Then the telegraph ain't gonna do me any good.
Bert...
I can't repay you for your kindness, but...
...this may help a little.
-Thanks.
Folding money!
Can you manage all those things yourself?
Oh, yes, Sir.
Better let me take that, too.
Woody.
Woody, I want you to have this along with my thanks.
Gosh, Mr. Creighton, thanks.
Goodbye, boys.
I'll see you next year.
-Get up!
-So long, Mr. Creighton.
-Nice fellow.
-Yes, Siree.
You don't believe what he said about that telegraph coming through here...
...do you?
-Of course not.
There ain't no such thing as a telegraph no how.
But he's a right nice fellow, just the same.
He sure is. Look what he give me.
-His watch and chain!
-Yes.
What does a fellow that goes to bed at sundown... and gets up at sunup want with a watch?
Well, it's a mighty pretty thing to wear.
Sounds nice, too.
Yes.
Across the plains the pay for drivers, diggers... pole men and timber cutters is two dollars a day.
And when we hit the Indian country, it's three dollars.... and every man supplies his own gun. O.K?
What do you mean O.K?
That's telegraph talk.
Means all right.
If the Doc here passes you, you buckos have got yourself a job.
You'll do.
You'll do. Stand up, son.
-Nice withers.
-I ain't no horse.
You'll wish you were before you're through.
Feels like you got a slug of lead there, partner.
-Forty-four?
-Indian arrowhead.
It don't bother me none.
Some members of the medical profession like to cut them out... but I say let them stay if they're that comfortable.
You know this country we're going into?
Weren't a hundred miles from here
I lost this hair back in fifty-six.
A neat bit of surgery that.
What's ailing you?
Did he say a hundred miles from here?
That was five years ago.
Nowadays we don't see no Indians this side of Cottonwood Springs.
Then you and me start drawing down an extra dollar, eh?
Speak for yourself, stranger.
When I get back to St. Joe,
I figure on keeping my hair... instead of telling the folks how I lost it.
Indians don't always scalp a fellow.
Not if the fellow scalps them first.
This ain't for me.
I've got to have peace and quiet when I'm preparing my victuals.
-Are you a cook?
-For twenty years... with the same head of hair.
And I intend to be for twenty more.
-Gents, I bid you good day.
-Hold him, Doc!
-Doctor Murdoch!
-Yeah?
Mr. Creighton says he don't need these no more.
Put them down.
Go down to the cook-house... and tell that good-for-nothing poisoner he's fired.
Can you cook lamb?
There are nine different ways to cook mutton and I know them all.
-Boiled, stewed, fricasseed.
-Never mind that.
Do you cook it with the hair on it?
-I should say not.
-Hurray!
-Then you're hired.
-No, no!
And your job is to see that he stays hired.
Remind me to show you an old
Indian way to cook prairie dog.
Oh, no. I should have stayed in St. Joe.
-Hello, Mr. Creighton.
-Oh, hello, Bert.
-Where's Miss Creighton, Pat?
-She's, over at the corral, Sir.
We're buying some new horses today.
How many have we, Bert?
Who's that with my sister, Pat?
The fellow I hired to do scouting and take charge of the livestock.
-Hello Sue.
-Edward, darling!
Don't tell me you've given up telegraphy for a corral?
Edward, I'm so glad you're back.
What's the doctor in Washington say?
Why, he says I'm fit as a fiddle.
I could walk from here to Salt Lake on my hands if I had to.
I'm so glad.
Shaw, this is Mr. Creighton, the big boss... the only man around here you have to be polite to.
I'm glad to know you, Shaw.
You've got to take a lot of horses and cattle a long way.
-Do you think you can manage it?
-I think so.
Good.
Come on, sis. You're supposed to be a telegrapher, you know.
-Goodbye, Mr. Shaw.
-Goodbye, ma'am.
What's the rush, Shaw?
We're not leaving here for a couple of days.
I'm leaving tonight.
-Why?
-You know why.
I like being alone.
The best place to be alone sometimes is in a crowd.
That's the way I figured it, till I ran into you.
There's a good chance for you in Western Union.
Is there?
I think so.
It's up to you.
You don't owe me nothing.
How could l?
I never saw you before.
Glad to meet you, Mr. Creighton.
Here.
Take a good chew of this.
-Helps keep your mind off things.
-Thanks.
Whoa.
Would you mind holding my horses for me, old man?
Thank you very much.
I'd like to see
Mr. Creighton, please.
-Next office.
-Thank you.
-You spell dude D-U-D-E.
-That's the way l...
No, E's a single dot, like that.
-You put a dash after it, like that.
-I did nothing of the sort.
Besides, I don't even know what you're talking about.
No, but I know what you're talking about.
Next time let's talk about...
Mr. Creighton?
-Yes, I'm Creighton.
-Richard Blake, reporting for work, Sir.
How do you do, Mr. Blake.
I was expecting you by stage.
The stage was so crowded and bumpy that I bought a spring wagon...
...and drove the last leg myself.
-Why, yes.
-Much more comfortable that way.
-Quite.
Mr. Blake, I want you to know
Homer Kettle, my assistant.
-This is Pat Grogan, our foreman.
-How do you do, gentlemen?
-How're you, sonny?
-Glad to know you, Blake.
The last leg of your trip must have been rather lonesome.
Well, I didn't mind that as much as I did the dust.
I could do with a bath.
A bath?
Yes. Don't you approve of them?
Well, if the weather's hot and you're near a river.
I ain't got a thing again them.
What type of work would you prefer to be assigned to, Mr. Blake?
Why, anything at all.
I had some engineering at Harvard... and I know the Morse Code inside out.
I think we can figure out something.
For the present, why don't you run on over to the hotel and... take your bath and we'll have a little talk later.
Thank you very much.
Good day, gentlemen.
...and you, too.
-Well, the...
Aw!
-Oh, Mr. Blake.
-Yes?
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry?
-Because I understand Morse Code?
-Yes.
No, I mean l...
You'll have to excuse me.
I have work to do.
Well, anyway, I'm happy to have met you, Miss Creighton.
You are the big boss sister, aren't you?
-Yes, but how'd you know?
-How did I know?
You both have that intense look.
Does the great Western outdoors do that to you?
No, it's people we meet from the East.
Some people you meet are going to insist on meeting you again.
So I won't say goodbye now.
Whoa, there. Whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
There, see?
Thank you very much. By the way, could you direct me to the hotel?
It's on Main Street.
Take your first turning to the right and go down two streets.
Thank you very much.
Just a minute, young man.
-Do you know who I am?
-I haven't the faintest idea.
I'm the Provisional Governor of the Territory of Nebraska.
You are? When you come up for reelection I'll vote for you.
You don't vote for a provisional Governor.
He's appointed by the president.
The next time I'm in Washington,
I'll put in a good word for you.
Watch out!
Would you mind telling me what that was that just passed through here?
That is the son of tough old Arad Blake... who made a fortune hauling freight through the Cumberland Gap...
...in the 30s.
-Arad Blake!
-That?
-Yes.
His father thinks a job with Western
Union'll make a man out of him.
Make a man.
When I was back East, Arad gave me fifty thousand dollars for the line.
I see. You got the son with the money.
Good heavens.
Do you see what I see?
Well, here I am.
All ready for work.
So I see.
Where'd you get that outfit?
-In town?
-Oh, no, New York.
I wanted to be sure of the fit.
-Not bad, huh?
-Blake, this is Shaw, our scout.
-How do you do?
-Howdy.
Well, a nice looking bunch of horses you have here.
Glad you like them.
-Do you ride?
-Oh, yes. Yes, indeed.
Them ain't livery stable animals.
Some of them are pretty wild.
Well, that's the way I like them.
Would you mind picking out one for me?
I'd be delighted.
Take that black one over there.
-This way, please.
-Excuse-me.
Somebody better call Doc Murdoch.
He don't mean it!
He's just fooling!
Go on! Stay with him!
Whoa! Whoa!
Steady, steady boy!
Whoa!
Steady.
Steady, boy.
Yeah. Nice animal, gentlemen.
You haven't anything else you'd like me to try?
No.
A little present for you, Homer.
-He's quite a talker, ain't he?
-Quite a rider, too.
-Hello, Mr. Blake.
-Hello.
-My brother isn't in right now.
-That's good.
-Won't you have a chair?
-Thank you.
Evening, Mr. Blake.
Hello.
Well, I guess
I'd better be running along.
So soon?
Well, I just thought I'd wish you a happy Fourth of July.
But that's tomorrow.
Well, I thought I'd be the first, but I see I wasn't.
Was that what you came for, too,
Mr. Shaw?
Uh huh.
Well, I reckon I'd better be going along, too.
Good night... both of you.
Thanks for dropping by.
Good night.
-Adiós.
-Good night.
I didn't have a chance to tell you before... but you did all right today on that bucking horse.
That wasn't so bad.
They gave you the worst critter in the lot.
You always do that with every tenderfoot, don't you?
Depends on the tenderfoot.
Well, I'm sorry I disappointed all of you... but I was riding horses before I could walk.
-Good night.
-Good night.
You going my way?
A transcontinental telegraph line... has long been the dream of Americans.
Now it is to become a reality.
A great reality that will eventually... triumph over hardship and privation.
It now gives me great pleasure... to present the chief Engineer of Western Union...
Mr. Edward Creighton.
Hurray!
I've just received a message here, which... better than any words of mine, will explain the urgency of our task.
"Allow me to wish you Godspeed on a journey... that will do much to help this Union in its hour of greatest need.
It is imperative that our Government... have quick communication with the West."
The message is signed
"Abraham Lincoln".
Let her go, boys.
You're happy, aren't you?
Every man is when his dream begins to materialize.
I know.
It's things like this that make some women wish they'd been born men.
Well, don't forget you've got a job to do, too.
-Goodbye, Sue.
-Goodbye, Edward. God bless you.
Something tells me I'm going to miss dear old Omaha.
Me, too.
I hate to say it, Miss Creighton, but I'm afraid this is goodbye.
Goodbye, Mr. Blake.
You'll take care of my brother, won't you?
I'll do my best, ma'am.
Don't you want him to take care of me, too?
I'll do that, too.
-Adiós, Miss Creighton.
-Goodbye!
I'm leaving Cheyenne
I'm off the mountain
Goodbye, old Paint
I'm leaving Cheyenne
Goodbye, old Paint
Hey!
Hey!
Stop that hollering and watch where you're going.
Five miles from Omaha and I'm a cripple already.
Come on there.
Men, we're doing fine.
Eleven miles in two days... but we've got to do better.
This is prairie country. We've got to make every minute count because... soon we're gonna hit the hills and we're liable to run into trouble.
Now that's all. Let's turn in now and get a good night's sleep.
Tomorrow we'll get at it again, bright and early.
Steady.
Steady.
-Hello, Mr. Shaw.
-Evening, Miss Creighton.
Well, I didn't expect to see you.
Is there anything wrong?
No, nothing wrong.
We're just a few miles out...
...so I sort of thought that...
-Good.
-Sit down.
-Thanks.
You see, I had some unfinished business here and l...
Good evening, Mr. Shaw.
I had some unfinished business, too.
Hello.
Well, at least you two'll have company on your ride back.
Get Doc Murdoch, quick!
-Is he hurt bad?
-He's pretty badly hurt.
Herb! What happened?
Indians got the cattle.
-We did the best we could.
-Sure you did. Where's Frank?
They killed him.
Here's where you and me start getting that extra dollar.
Bullet went right through you, Herb.
Hadn't ought to be no trouble at all.
Let's get him to my tent, boys.
I'll have more light to work by.
Come on, grab hold, Cooky.
He won't kick you.
Too bad.
Herb was a real nice fellow.
-He isn't dead yet.
-No, but I got a week's wages'...
...says he will be before morning.
-I'll take that bet.
Right.
-Pat, did they get all the cattle?
-That's what they say, Sir.
I can't figure this out.
This is Pawnee country... and Pawnees don't go after cattle when there's plenty of buffalo.
-Well, do you think it was rustlers?
-Don't know. I'll go have a look.
-How many men do you want?
-None.
You don't expect to bring back the cattle alone, do you?
I don't expect to get an Indian war started either.
First thing we gotta find out is what sort of game we're sitting in on.
All right.
-Double the guard tonight, Pat.
-Yes, Sir.
Come on, Homer.
I want you to call Fort Kearney.
Shaw!
Wait a minute.
-You going after them?
-Yes.
If you don't mind,
I'd like to go with you.
Sorry, but this is one job we don't trust to a tenderfoot... no matter how good he is.
How is he, Doc?
Better luck next time, Doc.
Reach and turn around slow.
Vance!
Jack.
-Howdy.
-Hello, Vance.
Howdy.
We knew you'd come back sooner or later.
Well, we kind of missed you since that little affair at North Platte.
-Where you been? Missouri?
-No, Omaha.
-Omaha? Wasn't that a little risky?
-Not very much.
My face isn't as well known as yours.
What're you doing out here?
Working for Western Union.
I came to get those cattle you rustled.
What do you mean, "rustled"?
We're soldiers now, fighting for the Confederacy.
Them clothes you got on don't look like no uniforms, to me.
Course not. We're guerillas under orders from General Moseby.
Did he order you to dress up like Indians and steal cattle?
As far as you're concerned, yes.
These here are my raiders, just like Moseby's got.
I do whatever I think'll help the cause along.
You might help the cause by going down south and joining the army.
You talk like you forgot where you was born.
You come from Missouri, same as me.
Are you going against your own people?
When they turn against their own country...
...they ain't my people any more.
-Well, they're mine... and they don't want this Yankee wire strung.
And as long as I'm alive, it ain't gonna to be.
You wouldn't be making a little money out of your fighting...
...would you?
-Why, sure, there's money in it.
We sort of combine business with pleasure, so to speak.
I want those cattle, Jack.
You know what you're going to have to do to get them, don't you?
-You win, for now.
-Wait a minute.
How do I know you won't tell
Creighton about us?
You don't.
-Supposing I don't let you go?
-Why don't you stop me?
Go ahead.
Adiós, Jack.
What do you think he'll do?
What can he do the way things are?
-Mr. Creighton
-Yes?
Those heathen savages sure cleaned us out.
What am I gonna tell the men when they start yelling for dinner?
Herman, tell them we'll get some more beef just as soon as possible.
That's a mighty indefinite answer to give to a hungry man.
They'll have to tighten up their belts for a day or two.
Did you ever try telling that to a fellow... after he'd sat down to the table and tied his napkin around his neck?
I did. Just once.
-Unsaddle and feed him, Joe.
-Want him rubbed down?
I'm gonna do that myself.
-Did you find any traces of them?
-They're up the river twenty miles.
-Indians?
-Yes.
-We'll get some men together and...
-I wouldn't.
They're a bunch of Dakotas a couple of hundred in the party.
I talked to them.
Don't they know they're inviting trouble by stealing our cattle?
They know there's no cavalry around here.
I tried to reason with them, but they wouldn't listen.
My advice is to charge the beef off to Indian good-will and let it go.
As I was boss of the herd, I reckon it's my fault they were stolen.
The best thing I can do is quit and clear out.
That's nonsense, Shaw.
You can't be held responsible for something like this.
Besides, I need you.
You're the boss.
-Sue!
-Hello, Ed.
-Hello, Mr. Shaw.
-Howdy, Miss Creighton.
-Hello.
-Hello.
What in heaven's name are you doing out here?
Why, I'm the new operator you sent for.
Are you responsible for this?
Well, I telegraphed Omaha... but I didn't know who they were going to send.
I'll bet you didn't.
Seems very much as if nobody wanted me.
Driver, when does that eastbound stage pass here? ln an hour or two.
You're going right back to Omaha, young lady... and you're going to stay there until I really send for you.
I can't help it if you send me back... but it was worth the trip just to see you.
Now, now. None of that.
I'd like to show you our thriving metropolis.
You really need a guide to get about, you know.
Very nice of you, Blake, but I want you to go ahead with the wagons.
-But...
-Shaw, you'll be responsible... for Miss Creighton while she's here. and seeing that she gets safely on the eastbound stage.
It'll be a pleasure, Sir.
Well, I must be off, it seems.
-Goodbye, Miss Creighton.
-Goodbye, Mr. Blake.
-I'm sorry you couldn't stay.
-So am l... but then that's the telegraph business for you.
Sue.
-Is he responsible for this?
-No, not altogether.
I just wanted to see you.
Honest I did.
We're going to be in Salt Lake before you know it.
-Oh, I hope so.
-I've got to go now.
The men are waiting at the head of the line.
So soon?
I've a thousand things to ask you.
And I've got a thousand things to do.
-Goodbye, dear.
-Goodbye, Edward.
Remember, the next time
I pay you a visit... that I'm your only sister and that I love you.
Yes.
I think he's a great man.
The whole family's sort of great.
It's coming.
What is it?
It's message from my brother at the end of the line.
He says "Haven't you gone yet?"
-What did you say?
-"No."
Thank you.
It's beautiful.
My brother says it looks like me, but, of course, he's prejudiced.
No, ma'am, not this time.
This way.
Sort of quiet with Western Union gone.
It'll be fifty years before Sinking
Wells has so much excitement again.
Like me, after the stage leaves.
I hope I haven't said anything
I hadn't ought to.
You haven't.
I know I haven't a chance against somebody like Blake, but...
Hadn't you better let me decide that?
I should've met you a couple of years ago.
Why?
Since then
I've made some mistakes.
Mistakes can be corrected.
Not always.
Does this here stage connect with the railroad that goes to St. Joe?
-She sure do, Partner.
-Mister, you got a passenger.
How's about you and me taking a little walk to work up an appetite?
But I don't feel like walking and I don't feel like eating.
Just the same, that's what you're gonna do.
I may not be seeing you again.
Don't say that.
We'll meet in Salt Lake.
Maybe.
Anyhow, I'll be thinking of you.
This might help you.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, Sue.
Get up.
Shaw!
Looks like we got company.
Mount your horse and warn the others.
Hurry! Jimmy! Eddie!
We're moving back to the main camp! Indians!
Get your guns and fall back!
Indians coming!
What's the matter, sonny?
You look a mite bit peaked.
A bunch of Sioux coming!
Ain't you traveling in the wrong direction?
I've gotta warn the men at the main camp.
I'm just about to make this connection.
Maybe it'd be quicker if you warned them by telegraph.
That is, unless you're anxious to get outta here.
Pull over, Partner.
Get up!
Get up!
You handle the key and I'll make the connection for you.
Come on. Hurry up.
Don't you worry, sonny. I ain't gonna let them Indians get you.
Swing your wagons so we can get behind them if we have to.
We'll make our stand here.
-Mr. Creighton!
-You gone crazy?
Indians are raiding the head of the line.
Indians! They're raiding the head of the line.
No. You stay here, Pat. I'll go.
They're on their way!
-Put it away. You won't need it.
-I'm not so sure.
I am, and until Mr. Creighton gets here, I'm boss.
Take it easy.
They'll stop.
How.
How.
-Whiskey?
-No Whiskey for Indian brother.
-You give whiskey.
-No got.
Me look.
Let'em alone.
Why, you drunken heathen.
If I had my way, I'd blast their dirty heads off.
Steady.
-Hey, put that down.
-Stay where you are. I'll get it.
Good!
Can't have.
Me keep. Good medicine.
No keep!
Stop! I can handle him.
Yippee! There they come!
I ought to take you apart.
I suppose that's the thanks I get for trying to help you.
Whenever I need your help,
I'll ask for it.
If you ever get my help again... you'll have to get down on your knees and beg for it.
Indians are raiding the main camp!
-Thanks, Charlie.
-You're welcome, Doc.
I think you're gonna lose this patient.
Not if I'm as good doctor as you are with that hatchet.
I wouldn't mind so much if he was only an Indian, but he ain't.
What?
No Indian ever looked like that.
I've got to keep this fellow alive.
Mr. Creighton'll want to ask him a few questions.
Doctor.
I got to have medical attention and I gotta have it quick.
-Are you shot, Herman?
-No, I ain't.
What's the matter with you?
This is private, and it's gotta be kept private.
Well, our white Indian didn't make it, Mr. Creighton.
Did he say anything before he died?
He called me a few bad names while I was sewing him up.
Have him buried immediately.
I don't want the men to know for the time being.
He's being slapped with a spade right now.
-What do you think of this, Shaw?
-I don't know.
-You got any ideas?
-No.
You said those Indians that you met today were drunk, didn't you?
Yeah.
A white man disguised as an Indian participated in the raid.
That means white men have got the real Indians drunk... and talked them into attacking us.
They ain't all Yankee out here, you know.
Apparently not.
You sure those Indians that got away with our beef were Indians?
They looked like Indians to me.
All right, that's all, boys.
Now go on about your jobs as if nothing had happened.
Shaw, you're taking over
Grogan's job as foreman.
I don't have to tell you what a responsibility it is.
Thanks, Mr. Creighton, but I can't take that job.
I haven't had the experience.
You've had more experience than any man in the outfit.
I want to, only...
You're not going to let me down at a time like this, are you, Shaw?
Somebody has got to take charge of things and pick out some new horses.
I can do that. There ought to be sixty or seventy head in Sage.
Then you'll take the job?
If that's the way you want it, Mr. Creighton.
That's the way I want it.
We'll go into town tomorrow.
We'll buy up whatever we can.
-All right. Good night.
-Good night.
May I talk to you for a minute, Sir?
Of course.
I don't like to butt in, I think we're making a grave mistake.
-Yes?
-I know you have great faith in Shaw.
You've just made him foreman and no doubt he deserved the post.
Come to the point, Blake.
Well, it seems to me if we ever want to get this wire strung... we'll have to act differently than we have, up to now.
What do you mean?
You know I'm not looking for a fight or trouble, but... look what happened to our cattle.
Look what happened today.
I suppose Shaw knows his business... but he let those Indians manhandle us... you'd think he was encouraging them to strike at us again.
However I guess there's a lot about the West I never will understand.
Good night.
Good night.
Well, I don't think we'll have to go any farther.
Come on.
Howdy, Vance.
Howdy, Jack.
You're Ed Creighton of Western Union, ain't you?
That's right.
My name's Jack Slade.
-Nice bunch of horses, ain't they?
-Very nice.
You wouldn't be in the market, would you?
I might. How much do you want for them?
Five thousand dollars and help yourself.
Our camp was raided yesterday by
Indians. They got most of our stock.
Then these ought to be just the thing for you.
They ought to, they're ours.
I said they're ours.
They were stolen from us.
Now look here, Creighton... you wouldn't accuse me of being a horse thief, would you?
No. I'll wait till I've heard your explanation.
I got these horses from a bunch of Indians.
-They didn't say where they got them.
-You didn't ask.
No, I didn't. And in this country when you call a man a horse thief... you better have some proof.
I bought these horses in good faith.
I aim to sell them the same way.
I guess I'd better see the law about this.
You'll have to go back to Omaha if you do.
-It don't run beyond there.
-I'll make some of my own.
That wouldn't look so good, would it?
Western Union stringing up white men for what a bunch of Indians did.
You've got all the answers, haven't you?
Shaw there might be able to give you a few more.
He knows this country inside out.
What he says makes sense, Mr.
Creighton. At least it does out here.
All right, I'm going to give you that five thousand dollars... because I've got a lot of work to do and no time for fighting.
I'm paying on the assumption that 5,000 dollars will buy you off.
If you bother Western Union again, the next payment will be in lead.
Is that clear?
-Now listen, Creighton...
-Make out a bill of sale.
I'll meet you at the saloon in fifteen minutes.
You two seem to know one another pretty well.
Yeah, we do.
-Old friends?
-More or less.
We were both raised in the same corner of Missouri.
-What'll you have?
-The bill of sale.
There it is.
All right. Here's a draft on the Bank of Omaha... for five thousand dollars.
You can cash this by telegraph if you want.
Oh, no. I trust you.
I suppose you deal in cattle, too.
Well, I ain't lately, but if you're in the market...
Just a question.
Well, Mr. Creighton, you're a right good man to do business with.
But only once.
Five thousand dollars!
Did all right by that outfit.
Yeah, and I ain't said goodbye to Mr. Ed Creighton yet.
-No?
-No.
But, first of all, I want to take a drink to the Confederate States of America.
If there was no Confederates, there wouldn't be no war.
Ain't that something to drink to?
-Yeah, but I think...
-You know... a good thing can be made to last a long time if you don't spoil it.
Besides, I'm a patriot.
Halt!
Are you Mr. Creighton?
Yes, I'm Creighton.
I'm Captain Harlow, from Fort Laramie.
-How do you do, Captain?
-I'm afraid I've got bad news for you.
Chief Spotted Horse of the Ogallala
Sioux has sent in word... that you can't build any more line through his nation.
No? Why not?
One of your men wounded his son yesterday.
They were drunk, Captain.
They raided our camp afterward and they killed several of my men.
Spotted Horse says none of his
Indians killed any white man.
Some renegades got a few of his young bucks drunk... and talked them into a horse-stealing raid to get some more whiskey.
The renegades did the killing.
So the chief feels that white men are to blame.
-Who are the renegades?
-Spotted Horse says he doesn't know.
Indians or not, I'm going ahead with the line, Captain.
-The Government is counting on it.
-I realize that, Mr. Creighton.
Washington has already notified me to help you all I can... but most of my troops have been ordered to the army of the Potomac.
Besides, an Indian war means a massacre. You wouldn't want that.
-Of course not.
-We have Spotted Horse's brother... at Fort Kearney as a hostage for the good behavior of the Ogallala.
I might try putting a little pressure on him.
-Maybe in two or three weeks...
-I can't wait.
See, winter is almost here and from now on every day counts.
If I could talk with the Chief perhaps I could change his mind.
I'm afraid that's too great a risk.
After what's happened you'd have to... go into his territory alone or with a couple of men, and unarmed.
Even then, there's no telling what he might do.
We've got to take that chance and with your permission, we will.
Thank you.
Come on!
-Mean looking devils, aren't they?
-Just don't get your wires crossed.
Whatever we do, we got to do quick.
Indians can't stay interested in one thing very long.
That's him.
Hook up your wires.
-How.
-How.
He says you come in peace today, but there won't be any peace... if you try to take the singing wire through the Ogallala nation.
Tell him the Great White Father who speaks over the singing wire is... sorry for the wounding of his indian son... but that the lightning talk is strong medicine and it must go through.
He says the Ogallala doesn't believe the singing wire's strong medicine.
Ask him if he'll let ten of his strongest braves... hold the tongue of the singing wire... that is, after we've proved it's harmless.
He says yes.
He wants to know why we pour water on the ground.
Tell him we must make sacrifice to the Rain God... who's brother to the Lightning.
Spotted Horse sees the connection between the Gods.
Now hold the wire, Shaw, and explain to him that it's... good medicine for us, but it's bad for our enemies.
Let them have it.
That's enough, Blake.
He says the Great
White Father's lightning... is the strongest medicine they've ever seen... that the singing wire can go through his nation in peace.
Tell him I promise that the singing wire will make good medicine... for the Ogallala against their enemies.
He says peace, peace.
Now let's get out of here before they have a chance to think it over.
I was sure everything was going to be all right from the first.
-Weren't you?
-Of course.
Never gave it a thought.
Barney, get up there!
Boys, I've called you to give you some good news for a change.
We've practically licked our job.
We're on the last leg and the finish is almost in sight.
You fellows have all done a great job. ln Salt Lake City, everybody gets two months' pay as a bonus.
And tonight, double portions of grub for everybody.
Come and get it.
Come and get it!
Jack wants to see you, Vance.
-What for?
-It's a matter of life and death.
He had an argument with a fellow over in Elkville and the fellow... plugged him in the stomach.
-Where is he?
-Only a couple of miles from here.
All right. I'll meet you on the other side of the camp.
All right.
Sorry, Vance, this is orders.
Come on.
Get the horses, boys.
Hi, Vance.
Now don't look so blamed sore.
I got you up here to save you from a roasting.
I'm going to burn out
Western Union tonight.
Didn't want you to be a part of it.
-That's mighty white of you.
-Well, you used to be one of us... and as far as I'm concerned, you still are.
You kept your mouth shut and played square. I didn't wanna see you hurt.
Get hold of yourself, Jack.
You can't fight a thing as big and as important as Western Union.
-Why, it's plumb loco to...
-No, it ain't, to me.
If this thing don't work tonight, something else will.
I'm gonna stop'em if I have to cut down every Yankee pole... between here and Omaha. Now, are you gonna be with us or not?
Jack, I want to give you some of the best advice you've ever had.
-Yeah?
-Let Western Union alone.
I'm not gonna let them alone
'till they've paid ten times over... for every foot of wire they're stringing.
This is better than owning a gold mine.
Steal their cattle, steal their horses, burn them out.
When they need more wagon, more horses, more cattle...
...we'll be on hand to sell it to them.
-You're a fool, Jack.
You can't go against a thing as big as this without getting hung.
Maybe I will, maybe I won't.
If you've got any sense, you'll string along with us.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
You come along with us, and I'll cut you in for half of my share.
-It's a bargain on one condition.
-Yeah?
That you agree to give up this bonfire business... and come back to Missouri with me.
We'll join up with General Moseby and be real guerillas.
Tie him up, boys, and tight.
Sure you won't change your mind and come with us?
-Not this trip.
-All right.
Come on, boys.
I looked everywhere, Mr. Creighton, but I can't find him.
-All right. I'll see him in the morning.
-Good night.
Good night, Joe.
-You looking for Shaw?
-Yes.
I saw him ride out of camp over an hour ago.
This timber's so dry it'll burn up like paper.
Be sure you circle the whole camp.
Fire! Fire!
Everybody out! It's a forest fire!
Forest fire! Come on!
Blake!
Come on! Get up! Get out!
Come on, everybody!
Take the horses out of the corral and hitch them up.
Hurry!
-Get all this on the wagons. Hurry!
-It's warm tonight.
Never mind that.
Get the insulators loaded.
Blake, come here!
Give me a hand!
The road's blocked.
Head for the lake!
-Where do you want him, Doc?
-Ambulance.
Come on, you fellows, get out of here.
Look out for that tree!
You can come back for more.
-Charlie.
-I'm so tired.
What's the matter, Herman?
A little accident?
No. When the fire started licking at his boots.. he ran clean up out of his britches.
Come on, now, Cooky, behave yourself.
Here, eat your stew, like a good boy.
Here. This is a nice little piece. Come on.
Isn't that good?
I didn't think you got back in time to get burned.
-You're next, son.
-Shaw, come to my tent.
I want to talk to you.
Thanks, Doc.
-Ever see this before?
-No.
Shaw, for a long time I've been expecting you to tell me something... but you didn't.
I've given you every chance.
The only conclusion I can draw now is I was wrong about you.
You know I didn't say anything when the cattle was stolen... and I didn't say anything about that horse deal in Sage... but your absence last night is something I won't put up with.
Now, once and for all,
I want the truth.
All right, pack up your things and get out.
-Is that all?
-Yes.
Well...
-I see you're clearing out.
-Yeah, for good.
After I go, there's a favor
I want you to do for me.
A favor? For you?
Tell Mr. Creighton
Jack Slade's my brother.
Your brother?
I wanted to tell him myself, but when a fellow's your own brother... there ain't much you can say. I'm going into Elkville on a little business.
Tell Mr. Creighton not to worry. Jack won't bother Western Union any more.
-Give me a shave.
-It's a pleasure, friend.
He's lose, Jack. And he's here now looking for you.
-Alone?
-Yeah.
-We'll stay here.
-All right.
If you'll excuse me,
I think I'll go and have dinner.
Put that cloth around me and get to work.
But my wife is a stickler for punctuality, and...
I live way over on the other side of town.
-Shut up and do as I tell ya.
-Yes, Sir.
And be careful you don't nick me if you know what's good for you.
Oh, no, Sir.
There he is.
-Maybe he didn't see us.
-He's seen us all right.
I know Vance.
-What are we gonna do?
-That depends. We'll see.
Here he comes.
Howdy, Vance.
Howdy, Jack.
-Did you come to join us?
-No.
I'm gonna give you an even break, Jack.
It can't go on this way any longer.
It's got to be either you or me, so... get up and take that apron off.
-Blake.
-Well?
Makes a nice sound, doesn't it, coming across the continent?
-It's music.
-I wish Shaw could hear it.
It's a long way from Salt Lake City to Boot Hill in Elkville... but I think he can hear it.
{1856}{1933}You're not cadets, and I'm not "sir."|Pull in your chin!
{1937}{2016}Stand at attention when you speak|to a noncommissioned officer!
{2020}{2049}-Brown.|-Yes, sergeant.

{2484}{2579}-Fine-looking mess of manhood.|-About face!
{2634}{2694}Right face!
{2698}{2758}Right face! Keep those heads up.
{2772}{2805}Higher!

{2990}{3036}Get your heads up!
{3147}{3244}-You're pretty fresh for a cadet, Sharp.|-Maybe I can afford to be, sergeant.
{3248}{3306}One day, you're gonna trip up|the wrong lad...
{3310}{3389}...find yourself on your face.|Your old man's money won't help.
{3393}{3438}That's the trouble with the Army...
{3442}{3480}-...makes no distinctions.|-No.
{3484}{3524}You're all alike here.
{3528}{3659}We don't say, "Welcome to West Point"|and turn out a guard in honor of any cadet.
{3663}{3777}Here's somebody you'll turn out a guard for.|Must be a brigadier general, at least.
{3911}{3974}Some foreigner calling|on the commandant.
{3978}{4030}Turn out the guard. General officer.
{4034}{4114}-Turn out the guard, general officer!|-Fall in!
{4220}{4269}Present arms!
{4414}{4469}Order arms!
{4592}{4665}Welcome to West Point.|May I direct you to the commandant?
{4669}{4727}Yes, if he's the proper person|for me to see.
{4731}{4813}I'm Mr. Custer. George Armstrong Custer|of Monroe, Michigan.
{4817}{4886}I've been appointed to the academy|as a cadet.
{4899}{4958}Welcome to West Point.
{4962}{5017}-Nice work, sarge.|-Dismiss the guard!
{5022}{5123}-What are you waiting for? Take charge.|-I'll show you to your quarters.
{5127}{5193}-Will you follow me?|-What about these hounds?
{5198}{5255}Oh, don't worry about them.|They'll follow me.
{5269}{5301}Unleash them, boy.
{5305}{5350}And here's a dollar for yourself.
{5354}{5400}Thank you, sir.
{5419}{5533}Well. I've done four hitches in the U.S.|Cavalry. I thought I'd seen everything.
{5537}{5586}But if that isn't the stra--
{5590}{5702}-You favor cavalier boots, I see, Mr. Custer.|-That's because I'm going into the Cavalry.
{5706}{5769}An infantryman's no better|than a beast of burden.
{5773}{5822}You have definite ideas, Mr. Custer.
{5826}{5889}What made you honor the Army|by choosing it?
{5893}{5933}Glory, Mr. Sharp, glory.
{5937}{5999}I wanna leave a name behind|the nation will honor.
{6003}{6074}There's many more statues for soldiers|than civilians.
{6078}{6141}I'm sure you'll fit right in|with the statues...
{6145}{6192}...just like part of the horse.
{6205}{6270}Well, here we are, Mr. Custer.
{6334}{6394}Orderlies haven't moved Pinchbelly's|things yet.
{6398}{6481}But don't you worry, Mr. Custer,|we'll fix that right away.
{6534}{6619}-Will you give me a hand with this junk?|-Oh, certainly, Mr. Sharp.
{6623}{6682}I trust I'm not inconveniencing anybody.
{6686}{6769}Oh, no, no. On the contrary,|it's you who have been inconvenienced.
{6774}{6810}Not at all.
{6814}{6865}Well, I hope you'll be comfortable here.
{6870}{6957}-As a first-year man, you don't rate a suite.|-No, of course not.
{6961}{7006}Well, confidentially, Mr. Sharp...
{7010}{7083}...these quarters are better than those|I'm accustomed to.
{7087}{7142}Oh, is that so?
{7146}{7233}My, that's a dashing-looking outfit|you're wearing, Mr. Custer.
{7237}{7272}Oh, thank you, Mr. Sharp.
{7277}{7342}Yes, we've nothing|to compare with it here.
{7346}{7458}Haven't you? Had it tailor-made in Monroe.|Wanted the folks to see me in uniform.
{7469}{7560}-Did you design it yourself, Mr. Custer?|-No, but if you've a moment...
{7564}{7639}-...I'll show you where I got the idea.|-Oh, certainly.
{7651}{7681}Here.
{7685}{7764}One of the greatest heroes|who ever lived, Mr. Sharp.
{7768}{7823}Murat, the king of cavalrymen.
{7827}{7909}He was known as the Thunderbolt,|and his one tactic was:
{7913}{7982}Ride to the sound of the guns.
{7997}{8066}I must get myself a tiger skin|as soon as possible.
{8070}{8105}-Quite a fellow.|-Oh, yes.
{8110}{8153}Well, I must be running.
{8157}{8240}I'm sorry, we can't make arrangements|for the dogs until tomorrow.
{8244}{8333}Oh, think nothing of it. They're accustomed|to sleeping with me anyway.
{8338}{8400}Oh, and thanks very much|for your kindness to me.
{8670}{8764}Well, Caesar, what do you want?|Why, you know you don't like onions.
{8769}{8859}What's the matter with you?|Oh, you want your bones, eh? Come on.
{8863}{8913}Come on. Come on.
{8917}{8997}Over here. Here, Caesar.|Come on, Hannibal. Come on.
{9001}{9082}Here you are. Here. Cleopatra.|There you are.
{9099}{9137}Here. There you are.
{9146}{9189}Hannibal!
{9691}{9768}What the continental blue blazes is this?!
{9930}{9968}-Sorry.|-Sorry?
{9972}{10037}-I didn't hear you knock.|-You didn't hear me knock?
{10072}{10140}-Anything I can do for you?|-Yes, there is.
{10144}{10233}You can tell me what you and your|menagerie are doing in my quarters...
{10238}{10294}...why my effects have been|thrown out...
{10298}{10350}...from what asylum you escaped...
{10354}{10460}...and how you're here in that comic opera|uniform instead of at a fancy-dress ball.
{10464}{10495}Well, sir, explain!
{10499}{10562}My name's Custer,|Cadet George Armstrong Custer.
{10566}{10634}-I was assigned these quarters.|-You were, were you?
{10638}{10729}Well, I'm Major Romulus Taipe,|quartermaster and commandeer of cadets...
{10758}{10819}...and this happens to be my quarters.
{10823}{10872}And you're an imbecile.
{10876}{10932}Who brought you here?
{10936}{10985}Well, who brought you here?
{10990}{11067}I asked you a question.|Who brought you here? What's his name?
{11071}{11116}-Mudd.|-Mudd?
{11120}{11169}There's no such name at the academy.
{11174}{11261}Are you presuming to trifle with me?
{11265}{11304}Well, don't you hear that call?
{11308}{11350}It's inspection for new cadets.
{11354}{11403}Get out and fall in!
{11430}{11536}I don't think your stay will be very long|with us, Mr. Custer.
{11540}{11633}I'm recommending you|for a mental examination.
{11657}{11698}Get out! Get out!
{11702}{11757}Get out, confound it! Get out of here!
{11762}{11805}Get out! Get out of here! Go on!
{11809}{11868}New cadets, fall in!
{11886}{11932}Get in line.
{11983}{12018}Straighten up that rank.
{12022}{12073}Prepare for inspection!
{12166}{12238}-Adjust your chin strap.|-Yes, sir.
{12286}{12372}What kind of sloppiness you call that?|Fix your belt. Take his name.
{12376}{12422}See that these men are instructed...
{12426}{12517}...in the proper way to wear their uniforms.|Extra drill, if necessary.
{12525}{12554}Yes, sir.
{12558}{12598}Eyes front, that man.
{12614}{12685}-I said, eyes front!|-That means you, Marshal Murat.
{12762}{12860}Well, it's going to take even less time|to get rid of you than I suspected.
{12864}{12907}Put this maniac under arrest.
{12911}{13001}-Take him before Colonel Sheridan.|-Yes, sir. Right face!
{13006}{13069}Forward march!
{13302}{13337}Mr. Custer...
{13342}{13398}...you are charged|with a very grave offense.
{13402}{13450}Didn't you know striking a superior...
{13454}{13521}...is one of the most serious|of military offenses...
{13525}{13597}...punishable in some cases with death?
{13610}{13657}Why did you strike Mr. Sharp?
{13661}{13721}I'm afraid I can't say.|It was a personal matter.
{13726}{13805}There are no personal matters|on the parade ground.
{13812}{13863}Have you anything further to say?
{13867}{13902}No, sir.
{13906}{13986}Then I have no alternative|but to dismiss you from the academy.
{13990}{14042}Dismiss?
{14096}{14183}I didn't know you could get fired|from the Army for fighting.
{14187}{14247}Well, you know it now.
{14322}{14393}-What is your listing, Mr. Custer?|-Listing?
{14398}{14457}Yes, listing. It's on the form.
{14462}{14527}-The form you signed in the office.|-What form?
{14531}{14615}I didn't sign any form. I haven't been|to the adjutant's office.
{14619}{14698}Do you mean that you haven't subscribed|to the articles of war?
{14702}{14742}No, sir.
{14804}{14877}In that case, we certainly can't|fire you from the Army.
{14881}{14972}You're not in the Army. You've been lucky.|Let this be a lesson to you.
{14976}{15032}-Take him over to the adjutant.|-Yes, sir.
{15036}{15096}-I'd like to thank--|-About face!
{15100}{15166}-I'd just like to--|-Forward march!
{15229}{15278}Thanks anyway, sir.
{15329}{15401}You know, Taipe, I'm glad|it turned out this way.
{15405}{15498}-There's something about that fellow I like.|-Yeah?
{15502}{15558}Well, I don't know what it is.
{15562}{15634}You ask me, he'll make the worst record|of any cadet...
{15638}{15697}...since Ulysses S. Grant.
{16235}{16332}At full charge, a 1 2-pound shell will burst|into approximately 50 fragments.
{16358}{16436}-Mr. Custer!|-Yes, sir.
{16441}{16514}You know how many fragments|will a 1 2-pound shell burst?
{16564}{16627}Certainly not less than two, sir.
{16788}{16839}Harold McCord.
{16866}{16922}Ronald McKenzie.
{16969}{17023}Francis Dupont.
{17027}{17085}-Congratulations, Mr. Dupont.|-Thank you, sir.
{17089}{17125}Edward Sharp.
{17130}{17168}-Good luck.|-Thank you, sir.
{17172}{17285}I never thought I'd envy that toad,|graduating ahead of me.
{17289}{17368}-I'd certainly like to be in his boots today.|-Why?
{17372}{17402}Why?
{17406}{17509}Because if Lincoln gets elected there's|gonna be a war. Sharp will be in it.
{17513}{17578}Bunkum. It's all talk, Custer.|There'll be no war.
{17582}{17627}No? Well, you wait and see, Rosser.
{17631}{17718}I tell you, if Lincoln gets elected,|the South will fight.
{18242}{18278}Battalion...
{18282}{18333}...ten-hut!
{18337}{18436}You are about to hear an order by a civilian|member of the national government.
{18444}{18490}Senator Smith.
{18494}{18581}Gentlemen, because of a present crisis|in the affairs of the nation...
{18586}{18636}...which menaces armed rebellion...
{18640}{18720}...and destruction of the union|established by our fathers...
{18724}{18807}...it has been decreed by Congress|that every officer and cadet...
{18811}{18894}...shall subscribe his name|to the following oath:
{18898}{18988}"l swear to maintain and defend|the sovereignty of the United States...
{18992}{19146}...as paramount to all allegiance or fealty|I may owe to any state or territory...
{19155}{19201}...so help me God."
{19205}{19351}Any officer or cadet who finds himself|unable to comply with its requirements...
{19355}{19414}...will fall out to the right|of the battalion.
{19510}{19578}Gentlemen of the South, fall out!
{19862}{19965}I see I was not misinformed as to|the preponderance of traitors at West Point.
{19970}{20064}It's high time that Congress acted|to clean out this nest of secessionists.
{20068}{20150}We don't concern ourselves|with the making of wars here, senator.
{20154}{20199}Only the fighting of them.
{20203}{20274}The academy leaves each man|to his own sense of honor.
{20278}{20334}Gentlemen of the South, fall in!
{20410}{20471}United States Military Academy...
{20475}{20534}...close to the left!
{20653}{20791}Gentlemen, I am sorry that our comradeship|must end in these unhappy circumstances.
{20795}{20842}We have lived as soldiers...
{20846}{20920}...and politics have had no place|among us.
{20929}{20974}Let us part then as we have lived:
{20978}{21112}In the determination to do our duty,|wherever it may lie.
{21165}{21257}-Have we your permission to move off?|-Move off, Captain Fitzhugh Lee.
{21261}{21299}Shoulder...
{21303}{21349}...arms!
{21370}{21449}Bandmaster, sound " Dixie"!
{21562}{21598}Company, left...
{21602}{21632}...face!
{21658}{21708}Battalion...
{21717}{21758}...march!
{22038}{22089}Eyes left!
{22093}{22126}Present arms!
{22203}{22244}Forward!
{22650}{22724}Frankly, I dislike the idea|of graduating junior classmen.
{22728}{22826}Emergency or no emergency, a half-baked|officer is worse than none at all.
{22830}{22885}But I couldn't make|the War Department see.
{22890}{23005}-At least the selection is left in our hands.|-Let's take them alphabetically. Who's first?
{23009}{23079}-Cadet Percival Anderson.|-Anderson.
{23083}{23135}Doesn't seem to have made|much impression.
{23139}{23248}Anderson's not the conspicuous type, sir.|But his record speaks for him. No demerits.
{23252}{23332}That might mean he's devoted himself|to keeping out of trouble.
{23336}{23397}Anderson will be the better off|for another year.
{23401}{23471}As a senior, he'd accept responsibility,|make decisions.
{23475}{23517}-I know, sir, but--|-Next!
{23521}{23563}George Armstrong Custer.
{23567}{23641}Well, there's nothing inconspicuous|about him, is there?
{23646}{23692}No, sir, nothing.|Nothing at all.
{23696}{23769}He has no regard for discipline,|organization, nor tactics.
{23774}{23814}And as for his record...
{23818}{23913}...George Armstrong Custer has the lowest|marks and the highest demerits...
{23917}{24034}...of any cadet who ever attended|this academy, including Ulysses S. Grant.
{24075}{24134}I wonder what happened to Grant.
{24147}{24177}Well, what about Custer?
{24182}{24245}He's the best rider|and the best swordsman we have.
{24250}{24315}He seems endowed|with a singular aggressiveness.
{24319}{24437}-A singular aggressiveness.|-The type that wins brawls, not battles.
{24441}{24523}-I tell you, sir, if you--|-What is your opinion of his quality?
{24527}{24589}A squadron would follow him to hell.
{24609}{24663}You're forgetting yourself, sergeant.
{24682}{24771}As I was saying, sir, Custer's the type|that wins brawls, not battles.
{24775}{24891}Right at this very moment, he's doing|a punishment tour for his latest escapade.
{25044}{25105}Carry that rifle properly|and quicken the pace.
{25115}{25192}-Why? Nobody's looking.|-Quiet! You're not allowed to talk...
{25196}{25231}...on punishment tour!
{25235}{25268}Move on!
{25662}{25731}I hope you won't think me bold|addressing a stranger...
{25735}{25832}...but I'm Elizabeth Bacon of Monroe,|and I think I'm lost.
{25836}{25896}Oh, but I'm speaking to you.
{25900}{25946}I'm trying to find Sheridan's house.
{25950}{26012}My father has business|at the commandant's office.
{26016}{26100}He thought he'd be a while, so he told me|to find the house myself.
{26104}{26160}Well, you see how I've found it.
{26164}{26230}It sounds silly getting lost,|but it's a big place...
{26234}{26317}...and I've never been here,|and I've forgotten all my directions.
{26322}{26379}I took that path over there|by the garden...
{26383}{26489}...and when I got in the middle,|I turned to admire the view--
{26610}{26692}Really, sir. I've been just as carefully|brought up as you have...
{26697}{26755}...and I think if I can speak|to a stranger...
{26759}{26857}...the least you can do is to reply,|particularly when that stranger's a lady.
{26862}{26921}I've told you who I am|and where I come from...
{26926}{27013}...and what my father's business is here,|and that, in an emergency...
{27018}{27059}...should be introduction enough.
{27063}{27190}And the least you can do is stand still|when I'm speaking to you. That's better.
{27393}{27457}I've never been so outrageously treated|in my life!
{27461}{27525}I thought West Point|was a place for gentlemen!
{27530}{27597}I thought our Army was|the flower of our country!
{27602}{27689}I shall tell my father about this.|I shall tell Colonel Sheridan!
{27693}{27750}Oh, you needn't start back now.|It's too late.
{27754}{27900}You can rehearse all the apologies you like,|but I shan't stay here to listen. Good day.
{28082}{28116}Mr. Custer.
{28143}{28228}You're wanted at the commandant's office.|Get there at the double.
{28232}{28303}-Right. Hang on to this.|-That isn't the right direction!
{28307}{28343}Oh, yes, it is!
{28347}{28398}Miss Bacon!
{28402}{28454}Miss Bacon. Please, you don't understand.
{28458}{28521}I couldn't speak to you.|It's against regulations.
{28525}{28574}Do you understand?
{28590}{28631}Halt!
{28676}{28766}If you're looking for Colonel Sheridan's|house, this is the right way.
{28787}{28846}I'm very sorry if I seemed rude...
{28850}{28934}...but while you're walking guard duty,|you're not allowed to talk.
{28938}{29018}-Well, then why didn't you say so?|-Well, I couldn't speak.
{29028}{29133}-Oh, you mean you couldn't speak!|-No! I mean, yes! I couldn't.
{29270}{29316}Well, thank you very much, sir.
{29320}{29391}And now that I've reached|my destination....
{29404}{29433}Oh, Miss Bacon?
{29450}{29534}Please don't go inside yet.|There's something I want to say to you.
{29538}{29604}See, I'm from Monroe too.|I haven't time to talk.
{29608}{29673}I'm due at the office.|If I keep Sheridan waiting--
{29677}{29721}Tell Uncle Phil you were with me.
{29725}{29772}-Uncle Phil?|-Colonel Sheridan.
{29776}{29808}Oh, is he your uncle?
{29812}{29874}Not exactly, but he and my father|are old friends.
{29878}{29961}-When I was little, I used to sit on his knee.|-Oh, I see.
{29966}{30025}I'm certainly glad|you never sat on my knee.
{30029}{30090}-Sir?|-Oh, I don't mean it that way, Miss Bacon.
{30094}{30154}If you'd been little enough|to sit on my knee...
{30158}{30232}...you'd be too old for me now--|I mean I'd be too old now.
{30269}{30321}Look, Miss Bacon, I really must go now...
{30325}{30410}...but do you think if I were|to come past your house around 9:00...
{30414}{30493}...you might be just sitting around|on the veranda?
{30511}{30556}Life is full of surprises.
{30560}{30667}And if I did find you sitting on the porch,|perhaps you and I could go for a walk.
{30680}{30772}We seem to have been walking together|ever since we've met.
{30791}{30875}I can't imagine, ma'am, if I may say so,|any pleasanter journey...
{30879}{30952}...than walking through life|with you beside me, ma'am.
{30956}{31002}I must go now.
{31306}{31352}Cadet Custer, reporting as ordered.
{31356}{31429}-Have you any idea why I sent for you?|-No, sir.
{31434}{31493}Do you know that you have|the worst record...
{31497}{31556}-...that West Point has had in years?|-Yes, sir.
{31561}{31606}-Why?|-I don't know, sir.
{31610}{31653}That's been puzzling me too.
{31679}{31801}Since you can't answer that, tell me why,|on the eve of your chance to graduate...
{31805}{31868}...you become involved in a brawl|with a civilian.
{31872}{31913}-lt wasn't a civilian, sir.|-What?
{31918}{31973}Oh, no. Just a Marine.
{31977}{32011}Well, Marine or civilian...
{32015}{32118}...unbecoming for a West Point cadet|to engage in fisticuffs on a public street.
{32122}{32189}Only extreme provocation|could call for such conduct.
{32193}{32295}It was. He said he'd been through two wars|and never seen a dead cavalryman.
{32299}{32358}What? Why....
{32362}{32425}Well, I trust when he recovers|from your reproof...
{32430}{32546}...that he'll be taken to the cemetery and|shown the grave of " Lighthorse Harry" Lee.
{32607}{32637}Mr. Custer...
{32642}{32712}...I suppose you had hoped to graduate|with your class?
{32716}{32792}-Yes, sir.|-And if you had, what were your plans?
{32796}{32878}An assignment to the 2nd Cavalry.|Finest regiment in the Army.
{32882}{32974}But there won't be any vacancies|if the others beat me to Washington.
{32978}{33057}In that case, I suggest you leave|on the next train.
{33061}{33140}-Sir? You mean, l--|-You are the last of the class to graduate.
{33153}{33225}The others have already received|their diplomas.
{33258}{33318}-Thank you, sir.|-I trust your future conduct...
{33322}{33398}...as an officer of the Army|will justify my confidence.
{33402}{33437}Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
{33469}{33498}And now...
{33502}{33564}-...that train leaves in an hour.|-Yes, sir.
{33593}{33630}In an hour, sir?
{33634}{33721}-I'm afraid I'll have to catch the late train.|-What? Why?
{33733}{33765}Well, l....
{33770}{33861}Well, I sent my laundry out yesterday,|and it hasn't come back yet, sir.
{33875}{33941}You've been running three years|to catch that train.
{33945}{33991}I suggest that you keep on running.
{33995}{34054}-Yes, sir, but--|-With or without your laundry.
{34058}{34118}Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
{34585}{34631}Oh, Father.
{34646}{34690}Hello, my dear.
{34698}{34757}Back from your walk already?
{34822}{34971}-What are you doing sitting here alone?|-Such a lovely night. I didn't want to go in.
{34986}{35053}Sounds as if you're falling in love with...
{35057}{35104}...West Point.
{35108}{35145}Oh, it's a beautiful place.
{35150}{35251}Especially when you have a handsome cadet|to show it to you in the moonlight.
{35275}{35325}I didn't go for my walk.
{35329}{35360}Why not?
{35364}{35422}-He didn't come back.|-He didn't come--?
{35426}{35473}Why, the young scoundrel!
{35477}{35576}A cadet is supposed to be an officer|and a gentleman. I'll speak to Sheridan.
{35580}{35659}-The insolent puppy.|-You mustn't talk like that.
{35663}{35746}-And why not?|-Because he's the man I'm going to marry!
{36269}{36358}-How does the adjutant general feel?|-He's barking like a fox.
{36441}{36517}-Any orders for me yet, corporal?|-No, Lieutenant Custer.
{36599}{36675}I'm sick of hanging around|to see the adjutant general.
{36679}{36798}I've written him time after time for|an assignment. I don't get any answer.
{36802}{36857}By Judas, I'm going in|to see him in person.
{36861}{36957}-He'll see no one except by appointment.|-He won't, eh?
{37777}{37825}Help! Fire!
{37830}{37871}Spies!
{37875}{37916}Sabotage!
{37920}{37957}What is all this--?
{37961}{38043}Get the fire brigade! Get water!|Get water, you idiots!
{38066}{38108}Don't let anybody in or out!
{38225}{38286}-Well--|-Why, Major Taipe.
{38290}{38329}I'm very glad to see you, sir.
{38333}{38399}Would you mind saying a word|to the adjutant general?
{38403}{38540}-I've been waiting weeks to be assigned--|-I have a feeling you're responsible for this.
{38544}{38597}But it will serve you to no purpose...
{38601}{38678}...because I happen to be|the adjutant general.
{38696}{38781}I happen to be well aware that|you've been awaiting for orders...
{38785}{38826}...and you'll continue to wait...
{38830}{38916}...until every competent officer|has been assigned to active duty.
{38920}{39013}And then, Mr. Custer,|I may find a place for you...
{39017}{39099}...training infantry recruits! Good day!
{39195}{39240}Ain't done much with your soup.|Don't like?
{39244}{39315}-No, it's all right, but you can take it away.|-Yes, sir.
{39319}{39405}Got something over here that'll excite|your palate, yes, sir.
{39410}{39453}Creamed onions.
{39488}{39524}Specialty of the house, sir.
{39529}{39589}Ever since President Andrew Jackson's|time.
{39594}{39628}Say, waiter...
{39632}{39697}...isn't that General Scott,|General Winfield Scott?
{39701}{39782}-How do you do, Charles?|-Very well. Kind of late today, general.
{39786}{39849}These are busy times, Charles.|Busy times.
{39873}{39941}Yes, sir, that's the general.|Commander in chief.
{39945}{40018}A powerful-eating gentleman, sir.
{40022}{40073}Only time for a snack, Charles.
{40078}{40173}I'll have my hors d'oeuvres, soup,|double rib sirloin, potatoes au gratin...
{40178}{40284}...asparagus, spiced pears and, of course,|the creamed Bermuda onions.
{40288}{40388}I'm desolate, general. The last portion|of Bermuda onions just been served.
{40392}{40450}I'll prepare more myself,|if you'll just wait.
{40454}{40517}Wait, man? With the Southern patrol|at Manassas?
{40522}{40577}This is war, Charles, war.
{40582}{40653}-I'll order the sweet later.|-Yes, sir.
{40702}{40754}Pardon me, sir. Mr. Custer, sir.
{40758}{40861}I couldn't help overhearing what you said.|These onions have just been served me.
{40865}{40982}-I'd deem it a pleasure if you'd accept them.|-That's generous, but I couldn't deprive you.
{40986}{41047}That is, of all of them.
{41051}{41121}-Will you lunch with me, Mr. Custer?|-Thank you, sir.
{41202}{41237}That's a good one, sir.
{41242}{41325}You mentioned having no appetite.|How do you account for that?
{41349}{41408}I think I lost it in the adjutant's office.
{41413}{41479}Camping around for weeks|waiting for an assignment...
{41483}{41579}-...and all the time, the rebels rolling down.|-lndeed.
{41583}{41630}How did you do at West Point?
{41634}{41716}Well, sir, first in equitation, sir,|first in swordplay.
{41720}{41749}And studies?
{41773}{41834}I was afraid you'd ask that, sir. Last.
{41874}{41978}Confidentially, young man, I saw|the West Point examination papers myself.
{41982}{42071}The only question I could answer was,|" Name the commander in chief...
{42075}{42130}...of the United States Army."
{42213}{42307}Mr. Custer, I think you better walk across|the street with me...
{42311}{42373}...as soon as we've disposed|of the Bermudas.
{42378}{42409}Right, sir.
{42414}{42447}What--?
{42487}{42597}-It's a fatal mistake to steam onions.|-Even when they're sealed in containers?
{42602}{42661}Under any circumstances.|You steam the best out.
{42666}{42732}General, you certainly know your onions.
{42757}{42812}Hold him here, Jones.|I may need him later.
{42816}{42923}Mr. Taipe, you're the man we want to see.|Post this officer to the 2nd Cavalry.
{42927}{43017}I know they have a vacancy.|I drew on them for an aide this morning.
{43022}{43098}-Yes, sir.|-You have no objections to the 2nd.
{43102}{43176}If there's a finer regiment,|someone will have to raise it.
{43180}{43270}-When are you to report?|-Tonight. Second may be going into action.
{43274}{43317}I can promise you it will, my boy.
{43322}{43413}It's impossible for him to report tonight.|There isn't a horse to be had.
{43418}{43516}If there is no horse, make the order|to report at the officer's first ability.
{43520}{43563}Very well, sir.
{43567}{43640}Sorry to disappoint,|but you'll see action soon enough.
{43644}{43692}-Good luck.|-Thank you, sir.
{43865}{43968}-This is General Taipe's horse.|-My compliments. And get out of my way!
{44178}{44237}Custer. Second lieutenant,|reporting for duty.
{44241}{44281}-Glad to have you.|-Thank you.
{44285}{44330}-Mr. Custer, gentlemen.|-Hello.
{44334}{44380}-Pleased to meet you.|-Have a drink.
{44384}{44469}-Thank you.|-Here's to bloody war and quick promotion.
{44474}{44544}You bet! A fellow ought to|come out of this a major.
{44548}{44603}-You're quite an optimist.|-Just feel lucky.
{44607}{44680}It'll take more than luck|with your grades in tactics.
{44685}{44732}-Hello, Sharp.|-You know each other?
{44736}{44796}General Blowhard and l|were at academy together.
{44800}{44914}Sure, that's right, sir. Now, there's a face|I always like to shake hands with.
{44930}{44997}Better be circumspect|with your squadron commander.
{45002}{45112}He had. You may have buffaloed through|West Point, but you'll toe the mark here.
{45118}{45150}Attention!
{45154}{45202}All right, gentlemen, as you were.
{45218}{45260}Mr. Custer, sir, just reported.
{45264}{45317}Well, you arrived|at an opportune moment.
{45322}{45389}We're moving on Manassas Junction,|attacking at 4 a.m.
{45393}{45459}Four a.m.? Good! We'll have them|on the run by 4 p.m.
{45463}{45541}I knew as soon as I got down here,|things would start moving.
{45812}{45872}Come on, men! Forward!
{47145}{47189}Dismount! Prepare to fight on foot!
{47434}{47525}Skirmishes. Guide center.|Forward.
{47738}{47808}What are you doing, Custer?|Retreat on Centerville.
{47812}{47860}Holding that bridge until|infantry gets across.
{47865}{47970}You had your orders.|G-Troop. Prepare to retire.
{47974}{48013}As you were, G-Troop.
{48018}{48081}I'm in command, Custer,|as long as I can stand.
{48085}{48132}That suits me.
{48183}{48250}Come on, men.|Let's take that bridge.
{48462}{48509}Ready. Aim. Fire.
{48717}{48759}Charge.
{48968}{49004}Fire.
{49362}{49401}Forward.
{49568}{49606}Forward.
{49744}{49844}-Oh, Custer, it's you. Good work.|-General Sheridan. General Sheridan.
{49848}{49921}-But you're hit, my boy.|-Yeah, I guess I am.
{49926}{50042}We can't grudge you a couple weeks in the|hospital and chance to go home. Good luck.
{50094}{50190}-Now this hand.|-Ladies, please, please. Isn't that enough?
{50194}{50268}Florence Nightingale had 30 nurses|to take care of an army.
{50272}{50314}Takes four of you to give me a bath.
{50318}{50401}Lieutenant, we want you to|look your best when you get your medal.
{50406}{50488}I don't want a medal. I want a|beefsteak and a bottle of bourbon.
{50492}{50538}Attention.
{50549}{50589}At ease.
{50608}{50692}-Hello, Custer. How are you, my boy?|-Oh, terrible, sir, terrible.
{50696}{50785}I get groomed and curried by|these nice ladies eight hours a day, sir.
{50789}{50891}That's one of the horrors of war, my boy.|Never mind. You'll be out of here soon.
{50895}{50972}Mr. Custer, when an officer|disobeys orders in action...
{50976}{51025}...there can be|one of two consequences:
{51030}{51077}A firing squad or a medal.
{51081}{51165}You seem to have drawn|the medal. This time.
{51191}{51247}Thank you, sir.|That kind of balances me up.
{51251}{51334}Ounce of lead in my right shoulder,|an ounce of silver on my left.
{51338}{51418}-ls there anything else you need?|-Yes, there is one thing, sir.
{51422}{51472}-What's that?|-A letter of introduction.
{51476}{51535}-To whom?|-To a Mr. Bacon, sir. Of Monroe.
{51539}{51627}-I understand he's an acquaintance of yours.|-Yes, he is. He--
{51631}{51662}But you're from Monroe.
{51666}{51745}-You ought to know Mr. Bacon.|-I'm not from his side of town.
{51771}{51827}I see. All right, my boy.
{51831}{51887}-I'll write that letter.|-Thank you, sir.
{51891}{51954}I don't suppose you|happen to know that...
{51958}{52025}...Mr. Bacon is the father|of a pretty young woman?
{52030}{52064}Oh, is that so?
{52082}{52147}Well, take care of that shoulder.|Good luck, my boy.
{52151}{52190}Thank you, sir.
{52238}{52288}Squad, at ease.
{52292}{52397}Ladies, I owe you a debt of gratitude|that no words of mine can ever repay.
{52401}{52481}Your ministrations performed|a miracle and hastened my recovery.
{52486}{52540}Thank you, Lieutenant Custer.
{52567}{52621}And now, I'm getting up.
{52643}{52710}-Oh, no. What?|-Lieutenant, you can't. You mustn't.
{52714}{52778}-Oh, but I can and I must.|-Oh, no.
{52783}{52865}-You're not well enough.|-Squad, attention.
{52940}{53030}Ladies, I bid you a fond farewell.|Squad, at ease.
{53034}{53115}-What are we going to do?|-Lieutenant Custer, come back here.
{54570}{54632}That's a fine song, sir. What is it?
{54650}{54725}A brother cavalier, what? Butler, sir.
{54730}{54784}"Queen's Own" Butler they call me.
{54788}{54891}Late of the 5th Royal Lancers,|presently of the 1 st Michigan Cavalry.
{54895}{54966}-Very happy. Custer, 2nd U.S. Cavalry.|-Custer?
{54970}{55031}-I say, not the bloke at Bull Run?|-Yeah.
{55035}{55077}-Won't you sit down, sir?|-Thanks.
{55081}{55196}Hi there, tapster. Unlimber that old spigot|arm of yours. There are pots to be tossed.
{55200}{55257}-Won't you join us in a drink?|-No, thanks.
{55261}{55314}Mustn't have liquor on my breath today...
{55318}{55373}...but I'd be glad to buy|you gentlemen a round.
{55377}{55437}Tell me, how did you join|the 1 st Michigan?
{55442}{55520}Well, I couldn't spell Connecticut.
{55524}{55608}It speaks for itself, eh?|But, sir, you asked about the song.
{55612}{55658}The name is "Garryowen."
{55662}{55776}And the 5th Royal Lancers rather fancied it|because it goes jolly well on a horse.
{55839}{55910}-I'd like to learn that song.|-I'm the lad to teach you.
{55923}{55961}All right, boys, together now.
{56133}{56173}Oh, good day, Mr. Bacon.
{56178}{56218}Oh, good day, Mr. Cartwright.
{56222}{56331}I hardly expected to meet you in this part|of town. I'm down here collecting the rent.
{56335}{56429}Whenever it falls due, I wish my family|had never acquired the property.
{56433}{56527}When the lease is up, I intend to see|the new tenant puts it to better use.
{56531}{56614}That is a consummation|devoutly to be wished.
{56618}{56693}-It's a blot upon the face of our community.|-Yes, yes.
{56697}{56776}-Well, good day, Mr. Bacon.|-Good day.
{56970}{57000}You.
{57004}{57064}Tell Mr. Sullivan|I wish to see him on business.
{57068}{57103}Find him yourself. I'm busy.
{57107}{57217}How dare you address me with|such insolence? I'm here to collect the rent.
{57337}{57420}-Be quiet, you drunken riffraff.|-Riffraff?
{57425}{57476}I advise you to be|careful of your words.
{57480}{57542}I'd advise you to be|more careful of your uniform.
{57546}{57604}Bringing disgrace on it|with drunken behavior.
{57608}{57720}What? Drunken?|Why, you fat little pipsqueak.
{57724}{57758}This gentleman's a soldier.
{57762}{57875}He stands in battle and gets shot at so that|sanctimonious little skinflints like you...
{57879}{57945}...can run around in safety|doing business as usual.
{57949}{58056}And if he wants to get drunk while he's|on leave, what business is it of yours?
{58061}{58151}Hear, hear. That's telling the old blighter|where he gets off, eh, what?
{58155}{58221}If you don't like our society,|why barge in on it?
{58226}{58353}I'm here because I prefer to collect the rent|of this establishment personally...
{58358}{58478}...rather than expose my clerks to such|an atmosphere of degrading debauchery.
{58519}{58609}Degrading debauchery?|The chap's quite an orator, what?
{58614}{58696}Your conduct is only what|I would expect from a foreigner.
{58700}{58797}But as for you, sir, you're a disgrace|to the Union Army.
{58814}{58854}Drum him out, Queen's Own.
{59224}{59322}-Do I have to drink the tea every time?|-lf you want the fortune to come true.
{59378}{59456}That's the fourth time today|I done read the tea leaves.
{59460}{59561}You keep drinking tea like that, and you's|going to turn as yellow as a canary.
{59628}{59669}Onions.
{59713}{59842}One. Two. Three.
{59846}{59909}There. I made my wish.
{59913}{60000}You going to get that wish all|wore out before it comes true.
{60006}{60132}Here we is, you and me, asking our fortune|from the tea. Look in the cup and I'll see...
{60136}{60180}...what I see.
{60184}{60276}Now, now, what's this I see?
{60280}{60391}What's this?|Appears to be like a bird. Yes.
{60395}{60474}Here's his wings spreading out.|He's flying this way.
{60478}{60556}Oh, yes, Callie, I can see it's a bird,|but what does it mean?
{60560}{60622}-It's a message coming straight to you.|-From him?
{60626}{60704}Give me time, Miss Libby,|give me time.
{60727}{60802}What's that tall and straight|walking beside the bird?
{60806}{60869}-Oh, let me see.|-Don't touch it, Miss Libby.
{60874}{60931}You'll spoil the spell.
{60938}{60992}Why, I declare, it's a man.
{60996}{61103}Now, what's he doing? He's pulling on|something with his left hand.
{61107}{61179}-Now, what can that be?|-A horse. He's in the Cavalry.
{61183}{61289}No, it ain't a horse.|Ain't a gun. It's, it's--
{61295}{61368}-No, it ain't a sword, neither.|-Oh, Callie.
{61372}{61414}-l's got it, l's got it!|-What?
{61418}{61463}It's a doorbell.
{61587}{61668}-Somebody's got to answer the door.|-And that somebody ain't me.
{61672}{61767}-That's magic, that bell.|-Oh, nonsense, Callie. It's all right.
{61771}{61825}Go on, Callie, answer it.
{61829}{61942}-Go on. It's all right.|-Oh, feet, keep me from slipping down.
{61946}{61997}Get my rabbit's foot.
{62046}{62132}Brother rabbit, work your charm|Keep this child away from harm
{62136}{62245}Ain 't got time to kneel and pray|Don 't you let me down today
{62451}{62512}Here he is, Miss Libby, here he is.
{62556}{62635}Just like the dead|riding up and saying howdy.
{62686}{62726}What's the matter, Miss Libby?
{62730}{62826}You got your wish, and you're standing|like your feet is glued in molasses.
{62830}{62860}Please, Callie.
{62864}{62978}-This gentleman, Mr.--? Mr.--?|-Why, Custer, ma'am.
{62982}{63044}Mr. Custer hasn't stated|what he's here for.
{63065}{63136}I have a letter to your father|from General Sheridan.
{63141}{63208}-My father will be home soon.|-And an apology for you.
{63212}{63266}-lsn't it a little late?|-A little late?
{63270}{63344}Three o'clock on a bright,|shiny afternoon?
{63349}{63393}Don't get uppity, Miss Libby.
{63398}{63476}Because the tea leaves never forgets|and they never forgive.
{63480}{63572}If you'd care to wait for my father,|I'll show you into the drawing room.
{63714}{63801}But, Miss Bacon.|It was really you I came to see.
{63806}{63872}-But why?|-Because, ma'am...
{63876}{63966}...I can't imagine anything worse|than walking through life without you.
{63970}{64076}Don't propose you come strolling by at|9:00 and find me sitting on the porch again.
{64080}{64157}I'm sorry. Won't you forgive me?|It really wasn't my fault.
{64161}{64232}I'm not really angry. I just thought|I should pretend to be.
{64237}{64298}I knew you when you didn't come back|you had good reason.
{64302}{64392}Yes. I had to report to Washington,|barely had time to catch the train.
{64396}{64469}And a train won't wait,|but a woman will.
{64474}{64570}Thank you, ma'am.|I was hoping you'd say that, ma'am.
{64578}{64650}Tell me, have you always lived|in this big house?
{64654}{64721}-Yes. Why?|-Oh, nothing, except I remember it well.
{64726}{64807}I'd ride by when I was a little fellow|on my way to go swimming.
{64811}{64884}There was a sassy brat|who used to hang on the gate...
{64889}{64969}...and stick her tongue out.|I pulled her pigtails for her once.
{64973}{65029}Was it you who pulled my pigtails?
{65033}{65084}Was it you who owned them?
{65117}{65157}-Oh, dear.|-What is it?
{65162}{65237}I don't see how I can smell onions|from the kitchen but--
{65242}{65384}Onions? Onions? That's funny. I don't|smell them. Don't you like onions?
{65388}{65505}Oh, I love them. I just thought that|maybe you didn't like them.
{65510}{65569}Oh, no. No, I'm very fond of them.
{65575}{65631}Callie, will you go|to the kitchen, please...
{65635}{65705}...and bring us back some of those|green spring onions?
{65738}{65837}-Onions?|-Yes, Callie, onions. You know I love them.
{65859}{65933}I knows what you love, honey.|It ain't onions.
{66030}{66099}Pardon me.|I didn't mean to touch your hand.
{66187}{66262}It's a pleasure to find somebody|who appreciates onions.
{66266}{66367}I was reading how Marshal Murat used to|demolish a whole plateful for breakfast.
{66371}{66442}Please, don't take that one.|Here's a better one for you.
{66446}{66506}See the fine, long grain in that one?
{66510}{66581}Good smell to it too. Try it.|That'll have a bite to it.
{66585}{66649}I said to the general,|"All I want is two things.
{66653}{66732}A week's leave and a letter|of introduction to your father."
{66748}{66787}Now...
{66797}{66909}...when you see Father,|all you have to do is say to him:
{66914}{67008}"May I return and call on Libby? "|No, you better say " Miss Bacon" first.
{67013}{67078}-Yes, that'd be better.|-Don't be afraid of him.
{67082}{67160}Afraid?|You're talking to a soldier, ma'am.
{67210}{67293}-Why, you's back early, Mr. Bacon.|-Yes, I am.
{67308}{67365}Oh, here comes Father now.
{67446}{67543}He's really a darling,|though he looks severe, so just speak up.
{67547}{67589}I will, ma'am.
{67605}{67678}-Father, dear, I'm so glad to see you.|-My dear.
{67682}{67745}-I want you to meet Lieutenant Custer.|-Custer?
{67749}{67877}-Yes. He has a letter from Phil Sheridan.|-General Sheridan. This must be important.
{68406}{68501}-How did this fellow get into my house?|-He has a letter from Uncle Phil.
{68506}{68568}So I'm a fat little pipsqueak, am l?
{68572}{68641}-I'm a sanctimonious old skinflint, am l?|-But, Father--
{68646}{68714}Hold your tongue. How dare you|come from that den of iniquity...
{68718}{68783}...that haunt of debauchery,|to pollute my home?
{68787}{68897}-Sorry, but if you'll allow me to explain--|-There's no explanation for your conduct.
{68902}{68994}-None that's fit for her ears.|-Sir, I have a letter of introduction...
{68998}{69072}-...from General Sheridan--|-A letter from the president...
{69076}{69157}...would be equally offensive.|Get out of my house.
{69161}{69244}-Go on.|-I'll show him out, Mr. Bacon.
{69248}{69295}Right this way, and good riddance.
{69299}{69389}The idea of you aggravating|quality folks like them.
{69394}{69485}Mr. Bacon done ordered you out,|and out you going right now, sir.
{69513}{69653}But not for good. You is coming back.|Nine o'clock at the gate.
{69694}{69817}Brother rabbit, work your charm|And keep that big boy out of harm
{70062}{70097}Libby.
{70173}{70230}It ain't unless you's colorblind.
{70246}{70297}Where is she? I thought you said--
{70315}{70379}Her papa's home with|his special kicking-out boots.
{70383}{70465}-Miss Libby's locked in her room. Come on.|-That ugly old fossil.
{70469}{70504}He can't do that to her.
{70509}{70608}That's what she said as he turned that lock.|They had a difference of opinion.
{70612}{70695}Now she's upstairs with her opinion,|and he's downstairs with his.
{70699}{70748}-Can you climb?|-Up there? Sure.
{70752}{70819}Wait a minute. I don't want|to cause her more trouble.
{70823}{70886}We better arrange a signal|in case he comes out.
{70890}{70940}-I can hoot like an owl.|-You can?
{70969}{70998}Oh, that's fine.
{71029}{71093}-George.|-Libby.
{71628}{71713}Oh, George. Isn't it awful?
{71718}{71808}It's worse than that. Just when I have|a chance to see you, I get orders.
{71812}{71884}-What orders? I meant Father.|-Well, I meant Uncle Sam.
{71888}{71928}I've got to rejoin my regiment.
{71932}{71997}-Oh, no. When?|-Tonight.
{72007}{72125}You can't. You'll be killed.|I won't let you.
{72294}{72363}-Who's out here?|-Just us owls, sir.
{72367}{72437}-Who?|-Just me and an old owl, Mr. Bacon.
{72442}{72557}-Have you seen anything of that scoundrel?|-I ain't seen hide nor hair of no scoundrel.
{72561}{72685}-Well, keep your eyes open.|-Yes, sir, that's just what I'm doing, sir.
{72752}{72812}-He's gone?|-I think so.
{72849}{72924}There's always the chance|he may come back again.
{73008}{73061}Oh, Libby.
{73090}{73190}-Will you marry me?|-Yes, George.
{73281}{73352}-What did you say?|-What? I said, will you marry me?
{73356}{73425}-When I'm a general.|-Oh, lieutenant.
{73429}{73473}Oh, it's easy to become a general.
{73478}{73572}Then that old crab-- I mean, that nice|old father of yours will be proud...
{73577}{73669}...to have me in the family. He'll be at|the station with hat in hand.
{73673}{73722}Yes, general.
{73932}{73977}The old owl.
{74019}{74097}Holy smoke!|It's your father. Goodbye.
{74613}{74693}What did you have to wake up for,|you old devil?
{74798}{74857}Don't you wink at me.
{74912}{74947}Take an order, corporal.
{74951}{75009}Commanding officer,|Sixteenth Ohio lnfantry.
{75014}{75086}You're required to report immediately|the percentage of...
{75090}{75216}...A, Methodists, B, Baptists, C,|other denominations among recruits.
{75220}{75328}Using form AGO 1 1 7|less Section 1 2 in compiling the return.
{75332}{75389}By order, et cetera, et cetera,|and initial it.
{75403}{75452}From the colonel|of the 2nd Cavalry.
{75456}{75533}He refuses to send back your horse|until Custer's return.
{75537}{75579}-That's tomorrow, sir.|-Does he?
{75583}{75684}Honor among horse thieves, I suppose.|Well, we'll see about that. Take an order.
{75688}{75785}Lieutenant George Armstrong Custer,|2nd Cavalry.
{75858}{75927}Taipe, Lee gave us the slip.|Don't know where he's heading.

{76082}{76175}Form AGO 21.|No, use the new form AGO 201.
{76179}{76254}It isn't issued. Get it from supply.|Take his desk, Smith.
{76258}{76314}What's the Michigan Brigade|doing at Hanover?
{76318}{76396}Refitting. They lost their commander|and haven't a brigadier.
{76400}{76469}Appoint one. The senior man|listed as Cavalry colonel.
{76474}{76532}-I don't know who he is, sir.|-Find out later.
{76536}{76589}-Dictate an order now.|-Yes, sir.
{76594}{76637}Take this, corporal.
{76641}{76738}I've been instructed to inform you|you've been promoted to Brigadier General.
{76742}{76849}You'll proceed to Hanover and assume|command of the Michigan Cavalry Brigade.
{76853}{76933}General Scott, sir. News.|Lee has invaded Pennsylvania.
{76937}{77037}-His patrols are near Gettysburg.|-Near Gettysburg!
{77041}{77116}This means a reconcentration.|Come with me, gentlemen.
{77120}{77165}-Sign this order, sir?|-Come, Taipe.
{77169}{77208}Yes, sir.
{77384}{77493}Gettysburg.|Where the deuce is Gettysburg?
{77799}{77850}This is your tent.|I'll unpack your kit.
{77854}{77910}The officers' mess|is at the end of the road.
{77914}{78010}Excuse me, lieutenant. I represent|George Straith Limited, military tailors.
{78014}{78096}We serve General Grant,|General Sherman, General Scott.
{78100}{78175}-Any requirements? Greatcoat? Breeches?|-No, thanks.
{78179}{78256}We can cut a fine tunic|for a figure like yours, lieutenant.
{78260}{78360}There's any ideas that you have of your|own, we'd be glad to incorporate them.
{78364}{78429}-No, thanks.|-There's a shell jacket that's admired.
{78433}{78504}-Particularly by the ladies.|-Shut up and leave me alone.
{78508}{78574}You're out of sorts, but if|you'd give me a chance--
{78578}{78632}Shut up and get out!
{78669}{78726}-Welcome back, general.|-Hello, general.
{78730}{78826}General? I'll have you know, gentlemen,|I'm in no mood for humor.
{78830}{78868}Good afternoon, general.
{78924}{79023}-Orderly, I'd like a little coffee, please.|-Congratulations, general.
{79027}{79065}That's enough of this fooling.
{79070}{79152}-Next man will find a limit to my patience.|-For General Custer.
{79218}{79310}-Sharp, I'll take this from anyone but you.|-Wait, we're not being funny.
{79314}{79381}The Lord knows how or why,|but you are a general.
{79385}{79420}-What do you mean?|-Orders.
{79424}{79533}Here's a letter from headquarters to|Brigadier General George Armstrong Custer.
{79550}{79633}-ls this someone's idea of a joke?|-There are no jokes in orders.
{79677}{79737}This makes less sense to me|than it does to you.
{79742}{79821}Must be a mistake. They don't|make generals out of shavetails.
{79825}{79897}I'd ask for verification if I were you.
{79902}{79961}Well, you don't happen to be me, Sharp.
{79965}{80061}If there are four regiments of cavalry|waiting for a general named Custer...
{80066}{80116}...then they've got him.
{80158}{80201}Hey.
{80217}{80309}Hi. Hey, tailor.|Hey. Tailor, come here.
{80665}{80724}Yesterday there was fighting|20 miles from here.
{80729}{80831}Our army has been driven out of Gettysburg|and occupies a ridge below town.
{80835}{80936}The orders are to concentrate below this|hill marked Big Round Top on the map.
{80940}{81000}Jeb Stuart's moving|to flank us from the south.
{81004}{81079}Undoubtedly. As senior colonel,|I'll assume command...
{81083}{81153}...if this brigadier hasn't arrived|by the time we move.
{81158}{81230}Who this Custer is and why he's|not here, I don't know.
{81234}{81285}Turn out the guard.|Commanding officer.
{81290}{81368}We'll get a chance to see|what he looks like now.
{81520}{81556}Judas priest, what's that?
{81560}{81637}He's got more gold braid on him|than a French admiral.
{81700}{81785}Gentlemen, we might as well|reach an understanding at first sight.
{81789}{81856}After seeing your columns|and your transports...
{81860}{81965}...I'm here to tell you that this brigade is|through with inefficiency as of today.
{81969}{82061}It's going to learn the meaning of|smartness and orders are to be obeyed.
{82065}{82121}-Do I make myself clear?|-Yes, sir.
{82125}{82158}We're ready to move, sir.
{82162}{82261}Brigade's ordered to concentrate on|Round Top, just south of Gettysburg.
{82265}{82294}What's that?
{82298}{82358}Probably enemy patrol|raiding the supply column.
{82362}{82433}Lee's in Gettysburg,|Stuart's cavalry's in the South.
{82437}{82533}Rejoin your units. Be prepared to move|in 1 0 minutes. Columns headed east.
{82537}{82572}-East?|-What?
{82576}{82634}-But the orders.|-To the devil with the orders.
{82638}{82684}We'll ride to the sound of the guns.
{82688}{82722}Things look better now.
{82726}{82809}With Cemetery back in our hands|and Sickles' front restored but--
{82814}{82858}Yesterday we lost 20,000 men.
{82862}{82908}Pickett's reinforced Longstreet.
{82912}{82981}-Massing to attack our center.|-I'm not worried about that.
{82985}{83021}I'm worried about Jeb Stuart.
{83026}{83081}Why hasn't he turned|the flank at Round Top?
{83085}{83145}He knows our cavalry's|concentrated to stop him.
{83150}{83273}When did our cavalry ever stop Jeb Stuart?|If he turns us, the position's lost.
{83277}{83350}Washington and Baltimore will fall.
{83451}{83489}Hanover?
{83498}{83566}Stuart. Stuart's caught at Hanover.
{83575}{83605}It's a mistake.
{83612}{83692}-Get verification at once.|-lt has been verified, sir.
{83805}{83889}He's on our rear. We're trapped.
{83893}{83960}All that stands between us|and total disaster...
{83964}{84034}...is the Michigan Brigade.|Handful of volunteers.
{84038}{84083}But they were ordered to Round Top.
{84087}{84166}-It's on its way now.|-Then stop it, Taipe. Stop it.
{84170}{84232}Tell it to hold its ground|to the last man.
{84237}{84271}Who's the brigadier?
{84275}{84333}-Why--|-Who is he, Taipe?
{84337}{84373}Why....
{84423}{84454}Corporal Smith.
{84469}{84546}As you were. Who's the new commander|of the Michigan Cavalry?
{84550}{84602}-General Custer, sir.|-General Custer.
{84609}{84677}-Custer? What Custer's that?|-George Armstrong Custer.
{84681}{84732}Here's a copy of the order.
{84749}{84822}-What is this? How did this happen?|-Well, who is he?
{84826}{84857}Heaven help us, sir.
{84861}{84933}The Michigan Brigade is led by|the most irresponsible...
{84937}{84997}...rattle-brained second lieutenant|in the Army.
{85125}{85188}Seventh Michigan, forward.
{85284}{85323}Trot!
{85417}{85446}Gallop!
{85480}{85526}Charge!
{86108}{86157}We'll take immediate action|with Custer.
{86161}{86229}This Custer of yours is|insubordinate, all right.
{86233}{86324}Thank God for it.|He's not marching on Round Top.
{86328}{86425}-He's attacking Stuart at Hanover!|-Attacking? Attacking a whole corps?
{86429}{86498}Rather than hold his ground,|the mad fool is attacking!
{86861}{86941}That was a gallant charge,|men, even if it failed.
{86946}{87040}Sergeant, see that the wounded|are taken care of.
{87072}{87121}Senior colonel presents|his compliments.
{87125}{87199}Fifth and 6th Michigan are|formed for attack. Any orders?
{87273}{87333}Try more weight.|Fifth and 6th attack together.
{87337}{87412}Very good. Where will the general's|headquarters be located?
{87416}{87490}Headquarters? In front|of the attacking regiment.
{87680}{87743}Fifth and 6th Michigan, forward!
{87919}{87960}Trot!
{88016}{88062}Gallop!
{88097}{88138}Charge!
{88721}{88798}The order in question, being|erroneous, is hereby revoked...
{88804}{88865}...and as of today, revert|to second lieutenant.
{88869}{88909}Never mind that, Taipe.
{88913}{88995}"Consecutive attacks by 7th, 6th,|5th Michigan Cavalry...
{88999}{89052}...are repulsed by losses near Hanover.
{89056}{89157}-Enemy advance continues."|-Three regiments ruined by a fool.
{89161}{89203}Three out of our last four.
{89420}{89456}Ride, you Wolverines!
{89461}{89520}First Michigan, charge!
{90453}{90533}What is it? What is it?|Read it to me, man.
{90537}{90621}"Stuart retiring in disorder after assault|by Michigan Cavalry...
{90625}{90681}...enemy abandoning guns."
{90796}{90835}And now, gentlemen...
{90840}{90917}...If Meade can hold the ridge|at Gettysburg...
{90923}{90993}...by God's grace,|the Union will be safe.
{91024}{91055}General...
{91059}{91101}...about this Custer matter...
{91105}{91207}-...what do you propose to do?|-Do? Do, Taipe?
{91240}{91288}Oh, yes, Custer.
{91293}{91355}I intend to walk across the street...
{91359}{91463}...and buy myself a double portion|of creamed Bermuda onions.
DRIVER: Whoa!
Drop those guns.
Everybody get out.
Do not try anything, and nobody will get hurt.
He said to come out, Miss Flower Belle.
- Well, I got nothing he wants.
- I will be the judge of that.
Come out, or I will have to kill all these nice people.
Don't mind being held up, but I don't like the inconvenience.
The Masked Bandit.
He's just another man to me.
Bring down the gold box.
Come on, take what you want and let's get out of here.
I will do that, my pretty one.
Put the gold in my saddlebags.
He kidnapped her.
Pile in, everybody. We've got to get to Little Bend and form a posse.
He just swept Flower Belle on his horse and away they went.
He got away with the gold shipment, too.
He did?
- There's Flower Belle's aunt and uncle.
- Let them through.
- Mr. Powell, I got bad news for you.
- What's that?
Your niece has been kidnapped by the Masked Bandit.
Flower Belle kidnapped?
Yes, and I'm forming a posse right now to hunt for him.
Come on, let's go!
It's going to be all right, honey.
She's back. Flower Belle's coming.
All by herself, too!
You sure, Zeb?
Sure. Come on.
Come on, boys.
Here she is.
I'm all right, I'm fine.
I'm so happy to see you. I was so worried.
I was in a tight spot, but I managed to wiggle out of it.
You always do.
Come on in the house, baby.
Flower Belle's back and I guess that's all there is to it.
Go home and rest easy.
Did he want to hold you for ransom?
How'd you escape?
Don't go asking her a lot of questions tonight.
Flower Belle must be plumb tuckered out after an experience like that.
If you don't mind,
I think I'll go up to my room.
Just one question, Flower Belle.
How did you manage to get back to town all by yourself?
Them hills is a long ways off.
He brought me to the edge of town, after it got good and dark.
Where'd he keep you all that time?
I see you got my things off the stagecoach.
Come up, Aunt Lou. I want to show you the pictures I had took at Big Bluff.
Bring up the baggage, Zeb.
Sure thing.
Good night, and thanks for looking for me.
These are right pretty pictures of you,
Flower Belle.
I like them. They look just like me.
Gold. Did the bandit give it to you?
Yeah, I figured it's only fair for the inconvenience I went through.
It's you.
I didn't expect you so soon.
I had to come.
I could not stay away.
The whole town's been looking for you.
Anyone see you?
No, my pretty one.
The Masked Bandit move like the shadow of the night.
That is beautiful.
When am I going to see your face?
You must be patient with me.
When am I going to see what I'm kissing?
Some day you will see.
I will take off this mask and never put it on again.
I recognised his horse... and then I saw their shadow on her window.
There they were, locked in each other's arms.
She and that bandit. And then he came out, mask and all, and rode away.
- lf you ask me, she's shielding him.
- Well, nobody's asking you so close your gopher trap. you old snapping turtle!
Silence. Young man, sit down and be quiet.
Are we to conclude that you deliberately refuse to tell us the true facts in this case?
I said all I'm gonna say, and that's nothing.
It's the opinion of this court, and the good, law-abiding citizens... that you constitute a menace to this community... and we hereby order you to leave town.
And not to return till you can prove that you're respectable and married.
All right, if that's how you feel, the feeling is mutual.
I wash my hands of you, too.
Young lady, are you trying to show contempt for this court?
No, I'm doing my best to hide it.
We've already sent word by pony express to Greasewood City that Flower Belle is on her way.
The Ladies Vigilante Committee will cooperate with you there.
Goodbye, honey.
Take care of yourself and be a good girl.
I'll be as good as I can, Uncle John.
- I've put your baggage on the train.
- All right.
All aboard!
How come you're going my way, Mr. Budge?
No luck in Little Bend?
As a matter of fact, I did quite well up to a certain point.
I was unusually lucky at faro,
I cleaned the house at blackjack... and I was just beginning to fix up a nice thing at draw poker... when someone asked to examine the deck.
Lucky you got away with your head.
Who's the human buzz saw?
I understand he's going to Greasewood City to be sheriff.
Yes, it seems they have to import them.
Nobody in town wants the job.
Sounds like the place might be interesting.
Ugh.
Ugh?
What're you doing down there?
How do you do, sir?
Have you any private cars on this train?
A room and bath with exclusive bar?
No, only day coaches.
Drat. Allow me a half a tick... to gather my portmanteau and some valuable belongings.
Milton, my lad, meet me in Greasewood City.
Ugh.
Oh, dear. Did you break your umbrella?
You can't break it.
It's a genuine Chamberlain.
Straighten them out very easily.
Yeah, that's better.
May I present my card?
"Money loaned on clothing, furs, fur..."
- Just a moment. How did that get in there?
- Thank you.
Was that chap dragging you across the prairie a full-blooded Indian?
Quite the antithesis. He's very anaemic.
What a pretty ring. Is it a cat's-eye?
Yes, it is a cat's-eye.
The pupil runs the wrong way. It's crossed.
Crossed with a bobcat.
Who is that vision of loveliness up there?
Pardon me, I'll be back. Keep the card.
Pardon me.
- Nice day.
- Is it?
Of course, it's only one man's opinion.
May I present my card?
"Novelties & Notions."
What kind of notions you got?
You'd be surprised.
Some are old. Some are new.
Whom have I the honour of addressing, m'lady?
They call me Flower Belle.
Flower Belle. What a euphonious appellation.
Easy on the ears and a banquet for the eyes.
You're kind of cute yourself.
- Thank you. I never argue with a lady.
- Smart boy.
Thank you again. Do you ever play cards?
Don't mind if I do.
I'll show you a few card tricks.
We'll play the first one at two for nothing.
Then if you wish to make a wager, that's okay.
Indians!
You boys get away from here. Private car.
That's murder.
They can't get away with this.
They can't intimidate me.
Get them right in the canteen.
Here, take them. Reload.
Flower Belle, take my gun.
FLOWER: This is better than a shooting gallery.
Fight going on in the other car.
Indians are attacking.
Here, that thing's no good.
Give me my slingshot.
Take this. Go in there and fight like men.
Come on, boys.
Come on, get in there.
What're you doing?
Here, get in there and fight like men.
- Look out. Get out of my way.
- What're you trying to do?
Out of my way, mademoiselle.
This is a man-sized job.
Backfired on me.
Must've got one of them.
Here. Flower Belle.
What are you doing with my hat on? Here.
There he goes in a shower of feathers.
Nice shooting.
I almost broke one of my fingernails.
That was swell shooting, Miss Lee.
Ah, a cadaver.
The curse of strong drink.
The Sheriff is dead. Long live the Sheriff.
I hope that wasn't whiskey you were drinking.
No, dear, just a little sheep dip.
Panacea for all stomach ailments.
Godfrey Daniel.
Tell me, prairie flower... can you give me the inside info... on yon damsel with a hot house cognomen.
- You mean Miss Flower Belle Lee?
- I don't mean some woman out in China.
Well, I'm afraid I can't say anything good about her.
I can see what's good. Tell me the rest.
On account of her carryings-on in Little Bend, she was asked to leave town... and she will not be permitted to return until she is respectable and married.
Furthermore, I don't think she'll be received in Greasewood City.
In fact, I don't think she'll be permitted to step off the train.
I hope she don't get too violent. I haven't strength enough to knock her down.
Well, goodbye.
The days of chivalry are not over.
Baby doll... these weed benders have been running off at the mouth to your detriment.
I ain't surprised. Bad news travels fast.
I understand you need a cicerone, a guide.
I need more than that, honey.
What symmetrical digits.
Soft as the fuzz on a baby's arm.
But quick on the trigger.
Yes. May I?
Help yourself.
Would you object if I avail myself of a second helping?
Don't you think you're a little forward on such short acquaintance?
You're compromising me.
May I present you with a little amulet... that I received from Aga Khan... when I was in the Himalayas?
It's just a little thing.
The Aga and I were very good friends.
What a pretty sentiment.
A lonesome heart. That's what I am.
It is not good for a man to be alone.
It's no fun for a woman, either.
Is it possible for us to be lonesome together?
Quite possible.
I will be all things to you:
Father, mother, husband, counsellor, Jackanapes, bartender...
You're offering quite a bundle, honey.
My heart is a bargain today.
Will you take me?
I'll take you and how.
I am the happiest mortal alive.
Miss Flower Belle has consented to be my lawfully wedded wife.
How wonderful.
I'm so happy for you, my dear.
That makes everything all right, doesn't it?
You're redeemed.
Not yet. We've got to see a preacher first.
I beg your pardon, but I'm not...
Excuse me.
See, they think you're a preacher. You look like one, now you've got to act like one.
Yes, but l...
I'm in a predicament. I'm depending on you.
You're my ace in the hole.
You got to do this for me.
Besides, he's got a bag full of money.
Well, of course, this is rather unusual for me... but under the circumstances, I'll deal.
I mean, I'll officiate.
We'll need a ring.
My dear, I will be your witness.
I think I have one here that will fit.
The fourth digit of the left hand.
Sorry I didn't have a little goose grease with me.
Perfect.
Yes, I guess that'll do the trick.
Shall we commence?
Of course, you're both acquainted with the rules of the game...
I mean, with the requirements of matrimony.
I got a pretty good idea.
Very well.
Now, do you, Flower Belle Lee...
I now pronounce you man and wife.
Allow me to congratulate you. And you, sir.
Thank you.
As is customary, the groom will kiss the bride.
- Greasewood City.
- Congratulations. Hope you're very happy.
Greasewood. Have to get out.
- Congratulations, I'm a married man myself.
- You look it.
I'm so happy for you, my dear.
I know you'll be happy, dear.
I hope it ain't one of the guests.
- Like a cosy little nest.
- Don't start crowing too soon.
Crowing. Very good.
Two rooms, if you don't mind.
Pass. The bridal suite.
We're married, you know.
I'll take the suite. Give him the room.
Yes, ma'am.
But my dove. My little dove.
Come right up this way.
My little dove pie.
I'm not speaking to you.
My little sugar-coated wedding cake.
A couple of house dicks.
Thank you.
Evidently an Ethiopian in the fuel supply.
Seems to me I'm getting the old "heave-ho."
- Here's your room, sir.
- Leave it there. I'll find it.
Telegram for Mrs. Twillie.
Shove it under the door.
I'll take it down. Leave it in the office.
By the way, my ski shoes and hockey bats will be on the next train. Along with a polo pony.
I understand the countryside abounds here with wild game. flamingos, flying wombats, Indian civets.....
Egad, the child's afraid of me. She's all a-twit.
Come, my phlox, my flower.
I have some very definite pear-shaped ideas that I'd like to discuss with thee.
Come, open.
You can't come in. Go away, I'm dressing.
I'm as gentle...
Gentle as a forest-bred lion.
And keep away from that keyhole.
It was the cat, dear. Listen, didn't you promise to love, honour, and be obedient?
Don't be old-fashioned.
Be a good boy and run along.
Why don't you look the town over?
What an unselfish little rose petal you are, to be sure.
Must be Big Chief's new tepee.
Milton, my brave.
Go upstairs and park your stoical presence outside the tepee of Mrs. Twillie.
Number 8.
I'll proceed to the local gin mill and absorb a beaker of firewater.
Big Chief gottum new squaw?
"New" is right.
She hasn't been unwrapped yet.
It certainly pays to be a good woman.
Yes, Squawk. It's been 20 years ago, come rapadance... since you and I tended bar together in The Old Buster House down on lower Broadway.
- Seems like yesterday.
- Yes, it does.
Squawk and I tended bar together,
20 years ago, down on lower...
My name's Twillie, Cuthbert J. Twillie.
One of the old Back Bay Twillies.
Thank you. I'm glad to know you, too.
Make yourself at home, Twillie.
If you still care to play cards, there's always a game.
Naturally. There may be a game of flinchback there, too. I was very good at...
In the alcove there.
Thanks.
Well, I'll see you later and we'll have another little conversation.
I'll raise it $100.
I'll make it $200.
Playing lone hand?
Up to now.
Would you like to engage in a little game of Cut?
The higher card wins?
- What stakes?
- Make it easy on yourself.
- $100, gold.
- I'll cover that.
I'm travelling a little light.
The country is fraught with marauders.
I'll give you my personal IOU.
A thing I seldom give to strangers.
That IOU better be good.
Worth its weight in gold.
King.
Don't show me the cards.
A gentleman's game.
I don't want to look at it.
Ace.
I didn't see it.
Very well, here you are, Nosy Parker.
Ace. I hope that satisfies your morbid curiosity.
Shall we have another go at it?
Probably at some future date. Excuse me.
Open game, gentlemen?
Deal me in. Give me $100 worth of chips.
$100 worth.
That's my stack.
Well, from the little acorn grew the mighty oak.
Beginner's luck, gentlemen.
Although I have devoted some time to the game.
Play cards.
Thank you.
During one of my treks through Afghanistan... we lost our corkscrew and were compelled to live on food and water...
Will you play cards?
...for several days. Yes, thank you. Yeah.
Take care of things, Pete.
I'm going out.
All right, Mr. Carter.
Where?
One of those city-slickers?
Gentlemen, my good fortune embarrasses me.
- How do you do, gentlemen?
- Take him inside and lump him up.
Unhand me, you parcel of rogues!
You know what the penalty for cheating is here?
I'm a stranger in these parts and unacquainted with the rules.
- Where can I purchase a book?
- You won't need a book.
The boys will teach you the rules in pantomime. Get him out of here!
Unhand... I'm an American citizen.
Unhand me!
I'm a taxpayer.
I shall write the Times about this.
Call me a barrister!
- How do you do?
- How do you do? Who are you?
I'm Jeff Badger. I own this place.
Is there anything I can do for you?
Yeah, you can get out of my way.
Unhand me, you uncouth lolligans.
Stay out.
This is sabotage.
A crime against liberty.
Hello, dear. My dove...
What do you call this?
- What do you call this?
- I'll ask the questions. You find the answers.
- Two of his roughs tried to do me in.
- For what reason?
They accused me of chicanery.
- This is a surprise.
- It was a surprise to me.
It's hard to trust people these days.
Mistakes will happen.
And after seeing you,
I know I must be wrong about him.
- We'll let it go at that.
- That's fine.
Let me show you there's no hard feelings and extend my hospitality.
The drinks are on the house. Mulligan.
Let Mr. Twillie have anything he wants.
Pardon me for a second.
Give me that bottle.
- Will you join me at the table?
- I don't mind if I do.
I see. A gentleman.
- I've been called other things, too.
- Who hasn't?
This reminds me of the White Palace in Chicago... only this ain't white.
- You're from Chicago?
- Yeah, every bit of me.
Spend much time around the White Palace?
Yeah, I worked there.
Singing and entertaining.
- A regular turn.
- Is that so?
Maybe you'll sing for me sometime.
Thanks, I don't need a job.
No, I mean, just as a special favour to me.
Yeah, I'll sing for you. Sometime.
Anytime.
I reached down into my boots... and I drew two more six shooters. Bang!
How'd you shoot three guns at once?
I had one in my teeth.
Three Indians bit the dust.
The slaughter I wreaked upon the poor savages was devastating.
I run this town and everything I say goes.
So if anybody tries to make any trouble for you... you can count on me to protect you.
Funny. Every man I meet wants to protect me.
I can't figure out what from.
This is a pretty wild country.
Boss, this guy Twillie is gunpowder.
He was on that train today that was raided by Injuns.
According to him, he beat them all single-handed.
What do you know about that?
- Say, he must be pretty good.
- It's news to me.
You know, I'm kind of sorry I accused a man of his fighting spirit of cheating.
Now, the best way to blot out the stain on his reputation is to honour him.
How do you mean?
I'm going to make him Sheriff of Greasewood City.
We need a sheriff, and he's just the man we've been looking for.
- For something else, but not for sheriff.
- It's all settled.
It was the Comanches, Chippewas, and the old Sepulveda Indians.
It gives me great pleasure to make a brave man like yourself Sheriff of Greasewood City.
Gentlemen, you overwhelm me.
Here, take this badge and pin it over my heart.
Well, Sheriff, congratulations.
I thank... Thank you. Be careful of that trigger finger.
This is ridiculous.
You can't make this man sheriff.
He's not fit for the job.
What have we here?
I'm running this town, Carter.
I've told you to keep out of my business if you want to go on peddling your papers.
If I want a sheriff, I'm going to have one.
Who is this muckraker?
There's one consolation, Badger.
He won't be sheriff very long.
- What do you mean by that?
- You ought to know what I mean. None of them last very long.
If this lady knows what's good for her, she and her husband will stay out of here.
- What's the argument?
- I never argue with a lady.
Play it safe, huh?
- Who is this high-collar, anyway?
- He just runs the newspaper here.
And he's got some idea about what he calls law and order.
I'd like to give the scamp a sound trouncing.
Just trounce yourself out of here.
Come on, we're going home.
Your pleasure is my pleasure, my peach.
Come back soon. Make the place your own.
That's an idea.
Thank you. We will.
Boys, she's gonna make a very pretty widow.
Git along, Christmas.
We got to find cousin Flower Belle.
Zeb?
Hi, Mrs. Gideon.
I'm looking for Flower Belle.
Well, you'll find her at the hotel.
She's married.
Married?
- Her name is Mrs. Twillie now.
- Twillie? You don't say.
Come on, Christmas. Look out, New Year.
Bet you a lei of beads.
No gottum lei.
What you got?
Five beads.
Five beads. I'll see them.
One, two, three, four, five. There you are.
What do you got?
Three squaws.
Three squaws? No good. Three chiefs.
Big Chief always win.
What are you up to now, you red rascal?
That'll teach you a lesson.
Teach you the bottle is mightier than the quiver.
- Big Chief catch trouble.
- Big Chief can catch no trouble... only from revenue agents for splitting a bottle of whiskey with an Indian.
Are you cousin Sheriff Twillie?
I'm a sheriff, but I haven't any relatives west of Canarsie.
I'm Flower Belle's cousin, Zeb.
You are?
Well, if you ever see your cousin tell her her husband would like to quaff a dish of tea with her sometime.
I don't think you and cousin Flower Belle are getting along the right way.
- Is there a right way?
- Well, sure there is.
Flower Belle likes her men strong, daring, what live life dangerously.
My boy, being Sheriff of this town is pretty dangerous.
The people here don't know the difference between the Sheriff and a clay pigeon.
Gosh, you mean your life ain't worth two cents?
Two cents?
Have you any of the elusive spondulicks on you?
You mean money?
That is correct.
You go back to the reservation and milk your elk.
Give this gentleman a seat. Sit down, Cousin.
Certainly good to see relatives far away from home.
Put the elusive right on the table there.
- You mean all of it?
- Every cent of it, yes.
Say, that's pretty good.
Is this a game of chance?
Not the way I play it, no.
You're beautiful.
I wonder what kind of a woman you really are.
Too bad, but I can't give out samples.
Ladies and gentlemen...
I'm not going to make a speech.
In fact, we're not going to have any speeches tonight.
We're just gonna have a good time and enjoy ourselves.
But I feel that it is my duty and privilege... to take this opportunity of welcoming a man to our community....
A man whose courage and daring has only recently been so well demonstrated....
Ladies and gentlemen further words are useless.
I'm referring to none other than Cuthbert J. Twillie, our new sheriff.
A little cramped.
Why don't you let me get you a shotgun divorce?
No, I'm saving it for a rainy day.
I know, but you should be thinking of your future.
- I ain't thinking of my past.
This is the stringiest vermicelli soup
I ever ate in my life.
It's all over the place. Light, though.
- Don't forget you promised to sing for me.
- I always keep my promise.
Ladies and gentlemen...
I have a surprise for you.
Our charming guest is gonna honour us with a song.
...that's the value of irrigation.
The agitated campaign...
- Something I can do for you?
- I don't know yet.
- I see you print things here.
- Yes. Everything but money.
I know some people ain't so particular.
Tell me, what is your objections to the new sheriff?
If you wanted to get rid of your husband I could think of no better way than having him made Sheriff of Greasewood.
Are you insinuating I got an ulterior motive?
- No, Mrs...
- Call me Flower Belle. But what about getting rid of the Sheriff?
Let me tell you what we're up against.
What are we up against?
There have been five sheriffs in the last six months.
Good hunting.
That's just about what it amounts to, and each of them died an unnatural death.
- Killed.
- Who done it?
There's no definite proof, but we suspect Badger and his men.
You mean Badger's a killer?
All I know is that Badger's the kind of a man that will stop at nothing to further his own ends.
He will, huh? Glad you told me.
Tell me more.
Why, there's no such thing as law and order in this town.
Decent citizens live in fear of their lives.
That ain't right.
There should be a law against it.
And another thing.
I've been trying for a long time to raise funds so that we could have a little... schoolhouse.
So that the youngsters could have some civilizing influence.
You mean the kids of this town don't get any book learning?
One of the ladies in the town teaches a class in a little shack that we fixed up... but she's not a regular teacher and she doesn't handle them very well.
They're bad boys and they get pretty unruly.
So was I, when I went to school back in Chicago.
But I guess I grew out of it. Or did I?
All I hope is that someday we can build this into a fine a city that a person would be proud to live in.
I see what you mean.
You're a man with ideals.
I guess I better be going while you've still got them.
- Miss Flower Belle?
- Yes?
I wondered if you would care to visit our little school with me tomorrow.
Coming from a big city like Chicago, you might be able to offer us... some suggestions, you know, for improvements.
It's kind of against my principles, but I will go with you.
Thanks. Can I see you to the hotel?
Just to the front door.
The Sheriff is very jealous.
Love and locksmiths.
- What are you trying to do?
- I'm Sheriff, my rhododendron.
Just warming up for a bit of innocent sleuthing.
- lf you're so curious, come on in.
- Thank you, dear.
Certainly, the days of chivalry are not over.
I have been worried about you, my little peach fuzz.
Have you been loitering somewhere?
- I've been learning things.
- Unnecessary.
You are the epitome of erudition.
A double superlative.
Can you handle it?
Yeah, and I can kick it around, too.
There is something sweet and dainty about a lady's boudoir.
How do you know?
Come on, answer the question.
Why, the latest etiquette books are just full of such knowledge.
For a second I thought
I heard the voice of experience.
De la bath.
Pussycat fur.
Luxury!
This is quite an extravaganza, dear.
Well, what...
Alcohol.
Very good brand, too. Imported?
What won't they get up to next?
What's this? New invention.
Why do you have to milk it?
My plum, a lovely bath tub.
I understand it's the only private bath in town. I'd hate to take one in public.
My dove, with your permission I shall dunk my pink and white body in yonder Roman tub.
I feel a bit gritty after the affairs of the day.
Go right ahead, honey. Help yourself.
My dove, no man was ever happier.
Yum, yum.
It is with regret that I part from you even to bathe.
Don't forget to take off your gloves.
- Thanks for your introspection, dear.
- Don't mention it.
For the nonce, adieu and au revoir.
TWILLIE: Man overboard!
This reminds me of the old swimming hole when I was a nipper.
That's where I got malaria.
What a foul summer that was.
It was the year the Jones boys murdered their mother.
Dear old lady. I can see her now, carrying the laundry home on her head.
My darling flower!
What is it, baby?
Baby. She calls me "baby."
I was just thinking how homey this all is.
Yeah, it's a nice thought.
What's your name?
Friend in need.
What did you say, my sweet?
Just agreeing with you, honey.
Drat.
Dear, I forgot to take the gloves off after all.
Just keep your mouth closed and let him do all the talking.
Pardon my redundancy, dear.
I shall join you in half a tick.
If you do this right, I'll get you one of his old straw hats.
I have been thoughtlessly cruel in absenting myself from you so long.
That's all right, honey.
I got a real surprise for you.
I'll bet you have at that, my dear.
There's a flower in the garden for you young man so pluck it if you can.
Here I come, dear. Ready or not.
I feel rather parky, dear, in this diaphanous ubeitsehr.
Don't recoil from me, my sweet.
Are you sleeping in your caracal coat?
You better take it off, dear. You won't feel the good of it when you go out.
It smells as though you haven't taken it to the cleaners lately.
You reek of old tin cans.
I beg your pardon, dear?
Mama.
The sweet little dear is calling for her mama.
What sublime innocence.
Kiss me goodnight
Godfrey Daniel!
Beelzebub. I've been hoodwinked.
Shadrach and Abednego. The mystery of the fur coat.
And I wanted to kiss you.
You didn't waste time finding out where I was.
I got run out of Little Bend on account of you.
Yes, I know.
I also know you got married. Why you do this to me?
Don't mean anything, honey. It's just for convenience. I got to be respectable.
I can explain it to you sometime.
But he's your husband.
Don't worry. He will never cross my threshold.
- You can trust me.
- Can I trust him?
Forget it.
You're the one man in my life right now.
I will be the one man in your life if I have to kill everyone else.
Save your lead, honey.
You got no competition.
My love.
That is beautiful.
You see, I ain't changed, have I?
You are more lovely than ever.
Last time you promised to take off your mask this time.
You are the Sheriff's wife now.
It would be very embarrassing for you to know who I am.
I've never been embarrassed in my life.
A little gift.
I go, my sweetest one.
Adios, my fastest one.
That's fine.
Let's have just one more with the landlord and then let him close up for the night.
What a conk.
The two-headed boy in the circus never had such a headache.
I think I'll write a book.
The Art of Arising the Morning After.
My kidneys. My pellagra.
Get me out of here, you red-skinned aborigine.
What do you think you are, you red rascal?
A Navajo rug or a hassock?
Chief no feel good?
I feel as though a midget with muddy feet had been walking over my tongue all night.
Cease.
Cease. Quiet.
You're under arrest for disturbing the peace.
- Sheriff. It's written on the badge.
- Wait a minute, Sheriff.
The stage was held up last night and robbed of considerable gold by the Masked Bandit.
How unfortunate. But he will have to split it.
We figured you'd want to form a posse and search for him before his trail gets cold.
Posse by all means.
Thank you, Sheriff.
Big posse.
One of the biggest posse... Milton.
My habiliment. Duty calls.
Never mind. It can call later.
Sleep, the most beautiful experience in life... except drink.
Boss, Carter's got the Sheriff's wife in his rig. They are just going by.
I suppose you're going to print about the
Masked Bandit holding up the stagecoach.
I wish I could print that we'd caught him.
- Everybody's after him, huh?
- Why not? After all, he's an outlaw.
Maybe he ain't so bad underneath.
People do a lot of things for different reasons.
He's pretty bad medicine. If I were you,
I wouldn't go out alone at night.
I can take care of myself.
Ain't met the man yet I was scared of.
How do you mean that?
You are very attractive, you know.
"Captivating" is the word, I think.
That's what you think.
Yes, and I think you could turn a man's head very easily... if he wasn't careful.
There's no fun in being too careful.
Aren't you forgetting that you are married?
I am doing my best.
I wish we'd met long before this.
You've met me now. I ain't complaining.
I know, but things might have been different.
How different?
I shouldn't be saying all this, I guess.
Maybe it's because it's spring, and spring is the time for love.
What's the matter with the rest of the year?
I have no right to tell you anything, but I will say this.
I don't like to see a girl like you go in to Badger's.
It's a sordid place and full of temptations.
I generally avoid temptation unless I can't resist it.
Pardon me. Okay. Thanks a lot.
Just taking Squawk Mulligan's place for a couple of hours.
Just gone down to the tonsorial parlours to get a haircut and shave.
Excuse me.
Soft pedal on that whistling, little lady.
It's bad luck. What's your pleasure?
Pour a whiskey, straight.
Go and take a seat at one of those tables.
I can't serve you here.
Listen, has that big stiff been in here today?
- I don't know who you are talking about.
- My husband.
- I don't know.
- I don't care.
I says to my husband this morning:
"The trouble with you is I'm too good for you."
How do you like that?
He didn't have an answer.
You're too quick-witted for him.
You're good at repartee.
Will you go over there and sit down at one of the tables?
Straight whiskey.
Thank you.
Squawk Mulligan tells me you buried your wife several years ago.
Yes, I had to. She died.
You know what else I says to him?
I will be candid with you. I do not know.
Straight.
Straight whiskey, thank you.
I says there ain't a man...
You're full of helium.
You better not take off your shoes.
You'll go straight up in the air. Now, listen... go over there and sit down at one of those tables.
The best man that ever breathed ain't good enough for the worst woman in the world.
Now listen, you pygmy.
Go over and sit down at one of those tables or I'll take you out of here and throw you on your head.
You and who else?
Me and Squawk Mulligan.
Okay.
You big tomboy.
Can you beat that?
Kinda tough.
Tough, nothing.
If I was in condition, and I had Squawk with me, I could lick two of them.
Give me a shot of that panther.
Yeah.
I am tending bar one time down the Lower East Side of New York.
A tough paloma comes in there by the name of Chicago Molly.
I cautioned her,
"None of your peccadilloes in here."
There was some hot lunch on the bar comprising of succotash...
Philadelphia cream cheese... and asparagus with mayonnaise.
She dips her mitt down in to this melange...
I'm yawning at the time, and she hits me right in the mug with it.
I jumps over the bar and knocks her down.
Where's the funnel?
I don't know. It's up along there somewhere.
You were there the night I knocked
Chicago Molly down, weren't you?
You knocked her down?
I was the one that knocked her down.
Yeah, that's right. He knocked her down.
But I was the one to start kicking her.
- Here's the funnel.
- Okay.
I starts kicking her in the midriff.
Did you ever kick a woman in the midriff that had a pair of corsets on?
No, I just can't recall any such incident right now.
Why, I almost broke my great toe.
I never had such a painful experience.
Did she ever come back again?
I'll say she came back. She came back a week later and beat the both of us up.
Yeah, but she had another woman with her.
An elderly lady with grey hair.
I had those two tough guys beat her up.
Sheriff, come out from behind that bar.
You're not wanted here.
You're crazy. I'm wanted for in nearly every state in the Union.
Come on.
We must all act together if we are ever to rid this town of Badger or any other lawbreaker.
Something's got to be done about this masked outlaw.
Unless we can catch him red-handed or can someway learn his identity, there's not much we can do.
I know someone who can identify the Masked Bandit.
Explain yourself, Mrs. Gideon.
- I don't wish to injure anyone's reputation.
- I'm sure you don't.
But Flower Belle, the Sheriff's wife, has an intimate acquaintance with him.
- What's that?
- Yes.
She was asked to leave Little Bend on account of him.
Of course, she claims she never saw his face, but...
That's possible.
But it is known he visited her in her own room.
So everybody in Little Bend believes that... Well, you know.
What else can everyone believe?...
I'm inclined to give her the benefit of the doubt.
However, I will agree to keep an accurate check on her activities.
Another thing. Your name was brought up at the Vigilante Committee meeting last night in connection with the masked outlaw who's been robbing the stages.
In what connection?
A person said that you've been well acquainted with him for some time and that you actually know who he is....
I don't know who he is. I wish I did.
Nobody believes me. I hope you do.
- I was just beginning to like you.
- I believe you.
Mr. Carter?
What is it, Lem?
- Miss Foster's fainted again.
- Who's Miss Foster?
She's the lady that's teaching school.
Come on. Let's see what we can do for her.
What's this, Miss Foster? Aren't you taking the job a little too seriously?
I guess it upsets me too much, when the boys get unruly.
Wet a towel and put it on her head.
Go back to your books, boys.
Don't let them get you upset.
It's your nerves, you need a rest.
You hear that? It gives you an example of what she's got to put up with.
- I better go dismiss the class for the day.
- No, that's what they're hoping you'll do.
I'll take over the class.
I'll show you how to handle them.
But I wouldn't think of imposing.
I'll give them learning they never got before.
Boys! Quiet!
This is Miss Flower Belle. She'll teach you your lessons for the rest of the day.
Boys, stand up.
Sit down.
Very good.
That's your first lesson in discipline.
I demand obedience.
Boys, education's a great thing.
I don't know what I'd do without mine.
Knowledge ain't so easy to get.
You got to work hard and study.
I'm still studying.
Of course, I don't study the same things you do, but it's a good idea.
Now, history. A very fascinating study.
In fact, it's my favourite reading.
What's your name?
Lem.
Lem, tell me, what do you know about Cleopatra?
Gosh, teacher, I ain't seen her.
Of course, you ain't.
She's a historical character. She lived way back in the early times.
What a time she had.
She used to fool around with snakes.
You mean, rattlesnakes?
These snakes didn't rattle, they crooned.
She was the Queen of Egypt.
I seen Little Egypt once.
They ain't related. Sit down.
By the way, what are you doing here, Pop?
Never had time to learn reading and writing up to now.
Carried a musket in '61.
Fought in Chickamauga and Bull Run, I did.
You did? That's fine.
Any questions?
We was doing arithmetic on the blackboard when Miss Foster took sick.
Arithmetic?
I was always pretty good at figures myself.
That will be enough of that.
Now this example is what is known as addition, or putting two and two together.
Why, teacher?
You said "Why?"
Yes, teacher.
That's what I thought you said, and that's a very good question, too.
Addition is when you take one thing and add it to another and you get two.
Two and two is four and five will get you 10, if you know how to work it.
Anyway, it all adds up in the end... and that, my dear young man, is addition.
What's subtraction, teacher?
Subtraction.
That's very simple.
For instance, a man has $100 and you leave him with $2.
Boy, that's subtraction.
I'm only gonna do this once, so everybody pay attention.
Eight and seven are 16 and nine are...
31, down one.
- That ain't right, teacher.
- What's wrong with it?
Eight and seven are 15 and nine are 24. Not 31.
I was just trying to trap you. Smart boy.
You will go to the head of the class.
In fact, step right up here and finish it.
"I am a good boy. I am a good man. I am a good girl."
What is this? Propaganda?
I wonder what would happen if you moved that one over there.
I see. It's just an experiment, that's all.
- May I come in?
- You are in.
I thought you might enjoy one of my pies, Sheriff.
- This is the one I baked especially for you.
- Thank you.
- Is this the raspberry?
- No, it's the gooseberry.
I was used to getting the raspberry.
I was beginning to enjoy it.
A little tart.
I won't keep you from your work, Sheriff... but sometime when your duties permit,
I'd enjoy having you to tea.
Tea, yes, fine, I'd like that.
- Shall we say sometime soon?
- Let us say sometime.
Accompany the lady to her home.
Sheriff. I don't need protection.
That's what you think.
Accompany the lady to her home.
Ugh.
Thank you.
- Goodbye, Sheriff.
- Goodbye. Don't forget, tea. I make wonderful crumpets, too.
Tea and crumpets. Tea and crumpets, what a combination.
Get my bottle out of that lower drawer, will you?
Say, Mrs. Gideon, she kinda likes you, don't she?
I intrigue all the ladies but Mrs. Twillie.
I understand the Masked Bandit can get an audience with her anytime he wishes.
Yeah, I guess so.
But cousin Flower Belle never knows when he's gonna show up.
- He sort of surprises her.
- He surprises her? That gives me an idea.
- I guess I'll go out and eat. So long.
- All right, so long.
Gives me an excellent idea. He surprises her?
I know where I can pick up the very thing.
Must be my two-gun Romeo.
I wasn't expecting you tonight, honey.
Wait a minute, honey. Let me get my breath.
What have you been drinking, embalming fluid?
What do you call this?
It's you, is it?
Chiquita.
What do you think this is gonna get you?
No jockey was ever ruled off for trying, chiquita.
What kind of a jockey?
I used to be a reindeer jockey.
Yeah? Well, don't think you're gonna win this by a nose.
My rose petal, just one little snuggle.
You cheat.
If a thing's worth having, it's worth cheating for.
Just one little osculation.
You got one under false pretences.
Then give me one that's on the up.
My love, you incinerate me.
Your walk, your talk... the way you wave your little pinky.
Your line ain't low enough to trip me.
I climbed the ladder of love to reach for the star.
Reach for the air.
I'm in no mood for astronomy.
What did you put this thing on for?
I have it on good authority a mask is the open sesame to your boudoir.
The child's afraid of me. She's all a-twit.
Didn't you promise to love, honour and be obedient?
I'm all wound up, my pink.
Why don't you go?
I am a heartbroken hombre.
You will be a heartbroken um-bay if you don't get out of here.
Chiquita.
Masked Bandit!
What's the matter? What happened?
Masked Bandit. Went that way.
Joe, stay here and take care of her.
Come with me to the Sheriff. We've got to report this.
The rest of you, round up the vigilantes.
Wait.
Come on. We've been on the wrong trail.
Get him, boys.
Wait a minute, unhand me. I'm the police.
You're also the Masked Bandit. All the time we thought you were a weakling.
This is a case of mistaken identity.
We'll see about that. Take him to the hotel.
You're all under arrest. Corpus delicti!
Wait a minute, boys.
Don't be in such a hurry with that rope.
Easy on the proboscis.
Explain it as I would, buttercakes.
- You've got the wrong man.
- You claim you never saw the bandit's face.
How do you know he's not the man?
- After all, he was found with this mask.
- Anyone could have a mask.
I just returned from a masquerade.
I impersonated the Ubangi.
Ridiculous. He just returned from stepping on my face.
They're both lying. She's as bad as he is.
She works hand in glove with him.
Come on, put her in jail and lock her up.
Wait a minute, ladies. I hardly think it's necessary to lock her up... if she gives us her word that she won't leave town.
Leave town?
Are you gonna let her hoodwink you the way she did in Little Bend?
No!
Lock her up.
- Doing your homework?
- Yup.
Need any help?
Whiskers were always my weakness.
I was just thinking, you look a lot like President Grant around the edges.
You don't mean that, do you?
You know, I got to admit your whiskers attract me.
Gosh, you are the first pretty woman what ever took a hankering to me.
You make me feel right pert.
A rendezvous with a goat.
Looks like the late Earl of Muffington.
Honey, I could stand a drink of water.
Go get me one.
Sure will.
That's a good boy.
Now, for being so nice, you can part the sagebrush and give me a kiss.
Gosh.
Open that door and let me out of here.
Hurry up or I'll blow your ears off.
I've been slickered.
Get in there and keep the Sheriff company.
The literature.
See you later...
Why did you slam the clink on me and keep me in stir? Is the honeymoon over?
Quiet. I'm doing this for your good.
How can I prove you ain't the bandit if I'm locked up in there?
I got to be on the outside to do things.
If you break out, too, they'll figure you're guilty for sure and swing you in the breeze.
Swinging gives me stomachache.
You ain't fooling.
Give me that literature.
A man's got to be plumb crazy to put a woman like Flower Belle in jail.
She hasn't done anything wrong.
And as for that tenderfoot sheriff... why, he couldn't keep his nose out of a bottle long enough to hold up a dog's tail, much less a stagecoach....
Go ahead and hang him if you want your fun. I got no love for him.
Boss, she's broke jail. She got clean away.
- No.
- What do you know about that?
Now, there's a woman after my own heart.
She even beat me to the draw.
She's in your office now.
Says she's got to see you right away.
She does? I won't keep her waiting none.
- What's up?
- You got to help. I can't stand by and see him hang for that outlaw.
What about this outlaw?
I heard you were friendly with him.
Just a midnight acquaintance.
I don't know who he is.
Are you in love with him?
What's the use of talking about that when a man's life is at stake?
I want to talk about it.
I heard you've been seeing him a long time, even before you came here.
They say he visits you in your room any time he feels like it.
You mean to tell me all this time you don't know who he is?
I wish I did.
- Are you going to help? They'll hang him.
- Let him hang. What do you care?
You'll be free to marry the Bandit or anyone you want.
That's got nothing to do with it.
I ain't married anyway.
What?
It was all a fake.
It was done by a gambler named
Amos Budge. He only looked like a preacher.
So that's it.
Amos Budge.
Now listen, Flower... forget about this bandit.
- I'm crazy about you.
- There's no time for this now.
There's always time for this and you know it.
A man's kiss is like his signature... his identification.
Unhand me, you bearded beaver!
You can't take the law into your own hands this way.
The man's entitled to a fair trial. Be reasonable.
I will write my assemblyman about this.
Men, you can't do this thing. Why, he hasn't got a chance to defend himself.
Wait a minute. I agree with that gentleman.
What's this thing doing here?
It's ruining my necktie.
Who's going to pay for my laundry?
Have you anything to say?
Yes, this is going to be a great lesson to me.
You villain. I advise you to make your peace for the hereafter.
I'm not thinking of the hereafter. I'm thinking of the present.
- Have you any last wish?
- Yes, I'd like to see Paris before I die.
Philadelphia will do.
Vote for Cuthbert J. Twillie for Sheriff.
Don't move, any of you. You either, Carter.
You trigger-brains can see for yourself he ain't the man you want.
You wouldn't believe me when I told you.
You'd rather hang an innocent man than take my word.
While you're talking, the man we want is getting away.
Don't let that worry you.
Open up them bags.
Look at that.
There's enough there to build a school, a church or anything else this town needs to make it civilized.
That's what you've been hoping for, ain't it?
Now, if any of you want to take out after that bandit, go to it.
I want to thank you personally for what you've done.
Not only for righting a wrong, but for helping us build for the future.
Civilization's a great thing.
I'm sorry, Flower Belle.
That's all right, honey. You did your best.
So, you're not married, after all?
- No, I'm as single as the day I was born.
- Great.
Now I can ask you something
I've wanted to for a long time.
I can even ask you to be my...
Excuse me for interrupting, Carter.
I know what you were going to say, but I'm afraid you're a little too late.
What do you mean?
Just a minute, boys.
You got me all confused.
- I like the both of you.
- But you can't marry both of us.
I know. That's the trouble.
You've got to give me a little time to think it over.
How much time?
Maybe tomorrow. Maybe never.
But don't let that keep you from coming around.
Any time you got nothing to do and lots of time to do it, come up.
You leaving, honey?
Yes. Goodbye, beauty.
I wanna give you back your wedding ring.
Guess I won't need it anymore.
Thanks. Maybe some other time.
- Yeah. I'll keep you on my wedding list.
- Thank you.
I have to hurry back East to attend to some oil wells I have there.
- Oil wells?
- Yes, hair oil wells.
What a man.
If you get up around the Grampian Hills you must come up and see me sometime.
I'll do that, my little chickadee.
Hey, wire.
Wire. They've drawn a fence across there.
Them plow-pushers must have put it up there last night.
Give me them wire cutters.
I'll fix this.
Cow herders!
Hey, cornhuskers!
Shad Wilkins, you've been tried and found guilty of the most serious crime west of the Pecos, to wit, shooting a steer.
Got anything to say for yourself before the sentence of the court is executed?
I told you they shot at me first!
I didn't mean to kill that steer on purpose!
I was aiming at the man.
It's your bad luck you missed him.
That's the trouble with you sodbusters, you can't shoot straight.
Shad, may the Lord have mercy on your soul. Hey!
Buck, I want to see you.
Well, how's the hanging, there?
Well, his neck didn't hardly stretch a foot.
Here's to the greatest woman in the world, the fairest flower that ever bloomed,
- Lily Langtry.
- Miss Langtry.
Hold it, boys.
Did you hear the toast, stranger?
To Lily Langtry? I thought you meant your friends.
I didn't know that included me.
That includes every man that drinks at my bar.
Glad to join you. Have you ever met Miss Langtry?
No, I never met her. I never met the sun, I never shook hands with the moon, and I've never been introduced to no clouds.
That's all right. Too bad Lily
Langtry couldn't have heard that.
Did you ever see her?
No, I was in England once, but didn't get around to it.
Oh, you was in England once, and you could have seen her,
- but you never got around to it, eh?
- Yeah.
- Get out of my bar.
- Huh?
Get out of my bar!
- To the Jersey Lily.
Miss Langtry.
Here's how.
All right, Mort, if Shad's good and cold, you can have him.
$4, that's all he had. I'll make it up to you on the next one.
Get off.
- What you got there?
- A horse thief, Judge.
Prisoner of the bar.
- Get in there.
Chickenfoot, the law.
Hear ye, hear ye, court of Vinegarroon is now in session.
What's the charge?
We caught him on Chickenfoot's horse that was stole last week.
- My horse Pete? Where's he at?
- Right outside.
Well, so it is. Pete.
No, Your Honor. I was just trying to get the lay of the land.
- You will, too, at the end of a rope.
Southeast, no anticipating.
Hey, Judge! Judge, that is my old sabino pony. He's tied right out there.
People of Vinegarroon again...
You can use any name you like.
Cole Harden.
What are you doing in Vinegarroon?
- Oh, just passing through.
- Homesteader?
- No.
Where do you hail from?
- No place in particular.
Where are you heading for?
- No place special.
- Oh, saddle bum, huh?
Well, it's all right to live on a horse if it's your own horse.
Bart, turn loose the prisoner's hands. Chickenfoot, swear him in.
Do you swear to tell the truth... So help you?
Take off your hat!
Well, now, I'll tell you, son...
Are you Bean?
- Judge Roy W. Bean.
- My name's Jane Ellen Mathews.
Yes, Miss Mathews, what can I do for you?
- What have you done with Shad Wilkins?
- Shad Wilkins?
He was working in the fields when some of your wranglers came up and took him away.
Shad Wilkins. Shad Wilkins.
Oh, yeah, he was hanging around out there a while back, but he ain't around now.
Your men not only took him away, but they tore down the fence.
Not a stick of it was left standing.
That so?
Yes, that's so, and you needn't pretend you don't know about it.
Well, it don't surprise me none.
It's against the law to build fences hereabouts.
- What law? Whose law?
- Mine.
- Now, you listen to me, Mr. Bean.
- Judge Bean.
You're no more a judge than I am. Just call yourself a judge.
I wouldn't say that if I was you. I might consider it contempt of court.
It's contempt, all right.
You call this a court?
I do, and it happens to be in session right now.
Southeast, get the young lady a chair.
Now, you sit down, Miss Mathews, and
I'll tend to your case in a minute.
You're charged with stealing a horse. Guilty or not guilty?
Not guilty.
Where's exhibit A?
- Huh?
Where's the horse? Bring in the horse, Chickenfoot.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, horse.
Miss Mathews, when cattle can't get to water, they die.
There's miles of river on each side of our homestead.
This country's unfenced rangeland.
It always was, and always will be.
Get in there. All right, give me room there, you guys.
Come on, get in there.
Whoa, Pete. Come on in here.
Come on, get over there.
Give us a little room.
All right, Judge, there he is.
Mr. Harden, it's my duty to inform you that the larceny of an equine is a capital offense, punishable by death, but you can rest assured that, in this court, a horse thief always gets a fair trial before he's hung.
- Chickenfoot, that's your horse?
- Oh, why, Judge...
Can you prove it's your horse?
Why, Judge, anybody here... I can prove it by Pete himself that he's my horse.
Pete, you're my horse, ain't you?
Ownership of horse clearly established. It belongs to Chickenfoot.
That's my ruling.
Well, I don't contest it, Your
Honor. Maybe the horse does belong to Chickenfoot here, but I didn't steal it.
- How'd you get it then?
- I bought it.
Order in the court!
- That all you got to say?
- That's all.
No, it's not. I'm not going to stay here and see anybody railroaded like this.
Miss Mathews, I don't recollect you was summoned as a witness in this trial.
What kind of a trial is it when a prisoner isn't even allowed to have anybody speak for him?
You an attorney, Miss?
I'm as much an attorney as you are a judge.
- You know this man?
- No, I don't.
- You ever see him before?
- No, but...
- Can you prove he didn't steal the horse?
- No.
Then he don't need no lawyer then.
This man was caught on a stolen horse, and in this jurisdiction, that's prima facie evidence.
- The case is closed and that's my ruling.
- Yes, and it's just like all your rulings!
The courtroom will now be cleared of everybody, excepting the judge, the jury, the prisoner, the witnesses and...
I guess that means you.
All right, I'll go. I don't want to see anymore.
It's murder, that's what it is. Murder.
This man hasn't got a chance, and you know it, but you never give anybody a chance.
You didn't give us one when you stampeded the cattle over our crops.
You thought you'd starve the homesteaders out, but you didn't.
You can pester us and rob us and kill us, but you can't stop us.
'Cause there'll always be more coming. More and more.
And we'll stay on our farms in spite of you, and your courtroom and your killers!
By gobs, she's all right.
She'd make a good cattleman.
If it wasn't for Lily, I'd marry her.
Giddap.
You heard the case against the accused, pro and con.
Now I guess maybe you'd better retire to consider a verdict.
Chickenfoot, you'd better take
Pete out for a little fresh air.
Take him out, Bart. I got work to do.
And while you retire, there'll be a recess for them that's thirsty.
Well, I guess you can't take it with you.
It's got to be strictly understood you ain't making no effort to influence the sober judgment of the jury.
- Certainly not.
- There you are.
- Compliments of the prisoner.
- Jury to the rear!
Bull's-eye.
- Join me, Your Honor?
- Don't mind if I do.
Don't spill none of that liquor, son. It eats right into the bar.
To the unfortunate lady with the bullet in her face.
The man that fired that bullet was hauled out of here feet first.
And he ought to be.
Any man that'd shoot at a picture of Lily Langtry ought to be killed.
It's just retribution.
It's justifiable homicide, that was my ruling.
Right.
You an admirer of Miss Lily's, too?
Well, that's putting it mildly.
She's the most beautiful woman I ever met.
Met?
You mean to tell me you met Lily
Langtry, the real her, in the flesh?
Oh, many times.
What an actress.
How'd you get to know her?
Well, that's a long story, Judge.
Bart, you and Blackjack get yourself a drink, huh?
Mighty fine liquor. What do you call it?
- Rub of the brush. Go on.
- Rub of the brush?
- Did you get to know her real well?
- It's got character.
I said, did you get to know her real well?
Now, Judge, you forget a gentleman never discusses a lady in a barroom.
Who said it's a barroom? This is a courtroom.
Say, tell me, is she as pretty as them pictures?
Why, the picture's never been made that can do justice to Lily Langtry.
Is she good-natured?
An angel.
- I'll never forget the night we met.
- Yeah?
I'll never forget it as long as I live.
Who was that?
Oh, that's Mort Borrow.
He cleans up around here.
Go on about Lily.
Oh, yeah, Lily.
How about a verdict?
Can't you see we're still considering the evidence?
Two aces. COWBOY
Bet a dollar and a half.
Stay once.
Get away from here. You smell of formaldehyde!
I'll call that.
You been down around Lanno Bay, ain't you?
Sure.
Well, you know how it is at sunset.
You can look out and that water ain't exactly blue, and it ain't exactly purple.
It's a kind of color a man can feel, but he can't put a name to.
Yeah.
Well, that's Lily's eyes.
By gobs!
I'm out. COWBOY
I'll stay out. Here we go.
Got 10. Got a nine.
You know how bright and coppery and gold-like a young chestnut horse is running in the bright sun?
- Yeah.
- Well, her hair is something like that.
In the daytime.
You mean it's different at night?
Well, not different, but just sort of more so.
- How so?
- Well...
Well, you know how it is at dusk when you see a prairie fire reflected in the sky.
A sort of a deep... A beautiful kind of blushing...
- Red?
- Red.
- Well, that'll give you a rough idea.
- By gobs.
I got a lock of her hair.
You mean to tell me you actually got the real... From her head?
I don't suppose you'd ever part with that lock of hair, no matter what a man was willing to give?
A man don't trade things like that.
You see that sword up there?
I wore it in the civil war.
Always meant to be buried with it.
Now, if you was willing to swap, why...
Would you really like to have it?
I'd rather own it than the state of Texas. Let's have a look at it.
I haven't got it with me.
Where's it at?
It's with my stuff in El Paso.
So, you was in the civil war, huh, Judge?
- El Paso, huh?
- Yeah.
- Cavalry, huh?
- I suppose you could write for it.
Yeah.
Wouldn't take long to get here by mail coach.
Oh, two, three weeks.
- Two or three weeks, huh?
- Yeah, about.
But I wouldn't part with that lock of hair for anything in the world.
The jury's ready, Judge.
That bottle of whiskey gone already?
Yeah, and if he ain't paid for it, you better start collecting now.
- What's the verdict?
- You know what the verdict is. Guilty.
There's only one thing I can do.
You're sentenced to hang, that's my ruling.
Turn loose the prisoner's hands.
- But, Judge, you just ruled...
- I didn't finish my ruling.
The court sentenced the prisoner to hang, but the court didn't say when. So long as there's reasonable doubt...
What reasonable doubt, Judge?
We just caught him with Chickenfoot's horse.
- Ain't any room for doubt.
- Order!
I been talking to the prisoner.
He's a friend of Lily Langtry's.
Stands to reason no friend of Lily
Langtry goes around stealing horses.
Leastways, there's a reasonable doubt.
You mean, you're setting aside your own ruling?
That ain't what I said. When
I make a ruling, it stands.
But, Judge, you just sentenced the man.
His sentence is suspended for a couple weeks until I can look into the matter further.
That's my ruling.
- Hi, Mort. How's business?
- Just lost a customer.
Well, I'll be down for a shave in a minute.
All right, you're next.
- Howdy, Judge.
- Hello, Evans.
Jersey Lily special.
Pardon me, you don't happen to have a twin brother, do you?
No, not me.
Well, you'd better pay me that money you owe me.
You're loco, brother.
I don't owe you nothing.
You owe me $60.
If you're interested, that's the man that sold me the roan horse.
Then, he's the man that stole...
$84 and 6 bits.
Fined $80 for disorderly conduct, and $4 and 6 bits for carrying concealed weapons.
Now, you men get some rope and string him up.
String him up? Why, he's dead already.
We hang horse thieves, don't we? String him up!
Come inside, son.
You can have his horse and outfit.
- Rub of the brush?
- Rub of the brush.
- El Paso.
- El Paso.
Good morning, Judge.
Who are you?
Who are you? What are you doing here?
Stranger. Stranger, come here.
Straighten out my neck, would you? Grab a hold of my head.
Now, jerk it quick.
Thank you. It's my neck.
You see I was hung once, but my friends cut me down in time.
Now when I don't live right, why, the crick comes back on me.
Now, who are you, anyhow?
And what are you doing here?
Why, don't you remember?
Why, I'm the fellow that filled the inside straight, and won Chickenfoot's horse.
So long, Judge.
Hey, Pete, are you glad I won you from Chickenfoot?
Well, that makes it nice.
Here.
Wait!
Wait!
That lock of hair, Lily's hair, you promised to write to El Paso for it. Don't you remember? We drank on it.
When are you going to do it?
Huh?
- You ain't going to crawfish?
- No, the first post office I come to.
Straighten her out, would you, son?
Thank you.
You mangy old scorpion, you might have got us both killed.
- What you want to go to California for?
- See the Pacific Ocean.
It's just like the gulf down at Lanno Bay.
It's bigger.
Why don't you stay around Vinegarroon awhile?
We could have a lot of fun together.
We could talk about Lily and...
No, I'm on my way.
Listen, it's a great country here, west of the Pecos.
A fellow could really make something of himself.
Why, when I first come here, I didn't have nothing.
Now, I'm boss of the whole section.
Well, that's mighty fine, Judge.
You know, I cottoned to you the first time I seen you.
Why don't you put in with me?
Well, I tell you, Judge, it's nice of you to ask me, but I'm heading for California, and nothing short of hanging can stop me.
Wait a minute. You can't go.
You're under suspended sentence.
- Why, you hung Mr. Evans for that.
- Huh?
You're under suspendence, anyhow.
Who are you? What do I know about you?
How do I know they ain't looking for you?
You're under arrest for disorderly conduct, for disturbing the peace, vagrancy, and you're on the way back to town with me, and that's my ruling!
So long, Judge.
By gobs, he stole my gun.
We hired out for farm work, Miss, not a civil war.
This ain't no fit place to homestead in.
Land's no good when there's always lead flying over it.
If you'd shoot back, maybe they'd stop bothering you.
We did shoot back.
And so did Shad Wilkins, and he ain't trying it no more.
What about your own quarter section?
- If you leave, you'll lose it.
- We don't want no part of it.
All right, Hod. If you feel that way, we'll try to get along with just Eph and Henry.
Not me.
Henry, if we only had one man, it'd be a big help.
Sorry, Mr. Mathews.
Call themselves men.
Wade, what do we do?
- I know what to do.
- No, no, wait. That's not the way.
Don't even think of it.
Wade, aren't you going to stay for supper?
I'll be back.
Well, they left.
Of course they have. What did you expect?
My hands quit, too. You can't blame them for leaving.
There won't be a hired man left in this part of the country if we don't do something about it.
We hire new hands, same thing will happen.
What's old Mathews going to say about it?
He keeps passing the buck to the Lord Jehovah.
I say, let's do something about it ourselves.
- That's right.
- That's what I like to hear.
Let's give the judge the same thing he gave Shad Wilkins.
Maybe if some of us went down and appealed to Roy Bean for justice...
Justice. If you'd seen him yesterday, pretending to try that prisoner...
The man didn't have a chance.
- I wonder if they hanged him.
- Don't they always?
He was the same as dead even while he stood there.
I've kept on seeing his face all day.
What is it, Daughter?
The man I told you about, the one that was hanged.
I saw him plain as day, looking in the window.
You're seeing things, Jane
Ellen. There's nobody out there.
I saw his face, I tell you.
Come in.
Good evening.
Pardon me for intruding like this.
Oh, no, you're not. It's just... Well, I thought you were a ghost.
Well, I guess you're partly to blame I'm not.
- I just stopped in to thank you.
- Father, this is Mister...
- Harden.
- Welcome, Mr. Harden, welcome.
Glad to meet you.
Oh, Mr. Harden, this is our neighbor Wade Harper.
This is the man I told you about.
You mean to tell me Bean tried you, and let you go?
Well, she was my lawyer. I guess she's the one that got me off.
- I knew you weren't a horse thief.
- Thanks.
How did you know that?
I just knew.
Are you working anywhere?
No, I'm heading for California.
Mr. Harden, I suppose a body that's just been hanged is apt to be a bit hungry.
You must stay for supper.
- Well, I don't want to put you out any.
- Oh, no, not at all.
Matter of fact, we had some company that just disappointed us.
Uh-huh. We were hoping somebody'd show up to take their place.
Make yourself at home, now. Make yourself at home.
Wait till you sink your teeth into some of Jane Ellen's stew.
Oh, Lord, for that which thou hast sent us in our hour of need, make us truly grateful.
Bless this food to our use and ourselves to thy service. Amen.
Let me help you.
How about some hominy?
- Here, Wade. Give him some milk.
- All right, all right.
Give him some milk.
I think he likes it here. I think we got him.
- What's he doing now?
- Feeding his horse.
Wade, he could probably take the place of two men. He's so big and strong.
- Well, I don't know how strong he is.
- Strong enough, Wade.
Now, Jane Ellen, we'll leave you alone with him, and you kind of add on a little more welcome.
- What'll I say?
- Oh, just keep smiling at him.
And, Daughter, if it should come up natural
- like, you might hint what a handsome man he is.
Handsome?
We need him terribly bad, Daughter.
We got to get that corn husked.
We need him terribly bad.
- Listen, your father don't mean for you to...
- Shh.
Look out.
Everything all right, Mr. Harden?
- Fine, thanks.
- Good. Now, I'll go see about your bunk.
- Oh, don't trouble.
- No trouble at all. Come on, Wade.
- Can I give you a hand?
- Oh, no, thanks.
- Won't you sit down, please?
- Well, I won't argue with you.
If I had to wash dishes,
I guess I'd give up eating.
Well, what do you do about the dishes when you're home?
Home? What? You mean in a house?
Well, you live in a house, don't you?
No. No, my house is all out there, all one room with a sky for a roof.
- Well, it's a big place.
- Got some space to rent.
Well, I guess California's your next stop, huh?
California, but I don't stop. Oregon next, I guess.
Well, all places aren't just the same.
Wouldn't you rather stay a little longer in some places?
No, they're all the same, beautiful when you leave them.
Well, it's like the turtles.
Carry their houses with them.
If I had to build me a house, I'd have it on wheels.
Not me. I'd want my house so that nothing could ever move it.
So down deep that an earthquake couldn't shake it, and a cyclone would be just another wind going by.
Well, you say, "Who wants to be a turtle?"
And I say, "I hope you'll be very happy in your house. "
- Well...
- Oh, say, wait a minute.
What?
I'll bet I know something we could agree on.
What's that?
Well, in about a week now, we're going to husk the corn, and I'll bet you'll agree that that's fun.
Well, you know, I think husking corn's the greatest fun in the world.
- Husking corn, fun?
- Oh, yes!
- Well, I'd rather wash dishes.
- Oh, no.
It was a fine supper, and good cooking.
Oh, Mr. Harden.
What a handsome man you are.
I doubt that, but I'm a tired one.
Well, I hope I see you in the morning before I leave.
Get out of here! Hey!
If anybody'd told me yesterday
I'd be playing tag in a cornfield with a lot of cows...
If we had some men that would ride fence, there wouldn't be any cows in the cornfield.
You were sure cute last night.
Now you're making fun of me.
Well, that's... That's more fun than picking corn.
Hey, look at your father. I wonder what's up.
I tried to stop them.
They wouldn't listen to me.
Wade!
Yes, yes. It's the wrong and lawless thing to do.
- I begged them not to. I told them.
- Who? What happened?
Wade Harper has rounded up some of the men.
They going to town to lynch Judge Bean.
- When did they leave?
- About an hour ago.
They took our wagon.
Thunder and lightning! You back from California already?
You got to get out of here, and don't stop for nothing.
Did you write to El Paso?
Listen, just get on your horse and get, because they're after you.
Did you write? Who's after me?
The homesteaders. They're going to string you up.
Why, that bunch of plow-pushing sod!
They're outside right now, a whole wagonload of them.
A wagonload? Why, I can handle a train load of them.
I'll tear their livers out.
What'll it be, gentlemen?
It'll be Roy Bean. Where is he?
He's out for a while.
That's because you came down here and warned him.
Make a move and I'll kill you.
Cole, start collecting them shotguns, uncork them rifles now and set them down this end of the bar, easy-like.
Go on.
Get back. Get back.
Now, I'll take yours, Judge.
The drinks are on me, gentlemen.
We're not drinking with you, Harden, nor him, either.
I ain't serving none of my liquor to no bunch of tomato-kissing,
- plow-pushing...
- Now, Judge, we don't want any harsh words to spoil this friendly little get-together.
Get-together?
Why, this pack of weasels invade the dignity of my courtroom, come in here armed with malice aforethought to kick up a rumpus...
Now, look, you being a judge, you know there's always two sides to any question.
These men have come here with a legitimate grievance.
We're not asking you to speak for us, Harden.
No, nor me, either.
Well, that makes it unanimous. I'm going to talk for the both of you.
There's a law here against fencing land that seems nothing short of murder to people raising crops, but it's common sense to men running cattle.
I've seen this kind of war before.
It's happening now, back in Kansas and Nebraska.
The cattlemen came in first, then the homesteaders moved in and fenced them out.
They had crops for one year, and then a dry spell, drought, so the homesteaders moved out, and the rush and thistle and jimson moved in.
And the big spaces were all broken up by little quarter sections, and the homesteads left empty, and the houses caved in, and the land, no good for man or cattle.
You spoiled the land, then you came here to spoil this land.
This here's a big country.
Yea, but it ain't big enough for cattlemen and homesteaders, and it never will be.
Now, clear out here. That's my ruling.
All right, Bean, we're going.
We're going back to build our fences.
If you do, you better build coffins along with them. Now, get.
You sure told them off, son.
Yep, and now I'm going to tell you off.
I'm sorry I stopped them from lynching you.
They got a right to defend their homesteads.
You know this ain't homestead land. You just said so yourself.
- The government didn't say so.
- I'm the government here.
Judas Priest, I don't see how you can talk up for scum like that.
They proved up on their land, and they got deeds to it.
When you make war on them, you're making war on their women and kids, too.
Those people were starved out last year.
I heard about those cattle being stampeded over their crops, and there's too many strays running loose in that valley right now, only they're not strays.
What do you want me to do? Arrest them cattle, and fine them a couple dollars apiece for trespass?
Now, look, those people don't take up much room with their little shirt-sized pieces of land.
Why don't you be a real judge for all of the people?
Why don't you try to see their side of it, and help them instead of fight them?
Make peace around here instead of war.
There's plenty of room for everybody, then everybody'd look up to you.
And then someday, maybe they'd put up a statue out there in the street, a statue with a carving on it.
"To Roy Bean, the real judge. "
What are you doing? Catching a fish?
I guess I'm wasting my time.
Hold on, wait a minute. You write that letter to El Paso yet?
- No!
- You promised. We drank on it.
I didn't have to write it.
I had it on me all the time.
You did? Well, why didn't you give it to me then?
You old bullhead, if I'd have given it to you, you'd have hung me.
Wouldn't you?
- I might've at that. Let's have a look at it.
- I haven't got it with me.
Suffering, bleeding
Chickamauga! Where's it at?
I left it over at the Mathews' place.
- How is she?
- Huh?
- I'll ride right over with you.
- No, no.
You mean you're gonna crawfish?
You ain't going to give it to me?
- Sure, I'll give it to you.
- When?
When the last steer's out of the valley.
All right, I'll pass the word around to the boys.
No, you don't. You're going to help run those cattle out, and I'm going along with you to see that it's done.
Don't you trust me, Cole?
When I was a kid, I had a pet rattlesnake.
I was fond of it, but I wouldn't turn my back on it.
You're all right.
I'm going back now, and gathering my stuff for the roundup.
- And that lock of hair.
- Yeah, yeah, the lock of hair.
He defended Bean. He said he was right.
Said the homesteaders spoiled this land for the cattlemen. We all heard it.
I don't care what you heard.
He couldn't be two-faced.
He's not that kind.
If he took Bean's part, he only did it to stop trouble.
Miss Mathews, looks like every time I get into trouble, you always speak up for me.
They're trying to tell me you spoke up for Bean.
Well, I did try to tell them Bean's point of view.
There you are.
It's always been my experience that when you know the other fellow's point of view, you usually get together.
Well, why didn't you tell him our point of view?
I did, and we got together.
You won't have to patrol your fields any longer.
Judge gave me his word they'd round up all cattle in this valley and take them out of here.
You think he'd keep his word?
Well, I'm going along with him to see that he does.
Well, what makes you think we'd take your word?
Take it or leave it.
Harden, you're a sneak and a liar.
Miss Mathews!
I'll be back.
California's that way.
I got something to tell you before I go.
- Well?
- How's Wade?
He's fine, just fine.
You know, you're not the prettiest girl I ever saw.
Well, that's great news. Who asked you?
But you've got the prettiest hair I ever saw.
Why do you like to make fun of me?
'Cause I like you, I guess.
- And you think my hair's pretty, huh?
- I never saw anything like it.
- Oh, could I clip a lock?
- No, you can't.
- Will you clip one?
- No, I won't.
Come around here, take sides with Bean, and knock out my best friend, and...
Tell you how much I like you, and how much I might miss you?
- All right?
- No.
Here, these are yours.
Well, thanks a lot.
Jane Ellen!
Go on, Cole. Go on.
Well, so I says to her...
I said, "Miss Langtry,
"do you plan to go back to England when you finish your American tour?"
And she said to me... She said,
"No. " Said she loved the
United States too much.
- Yeah?
- She planned to stay here for the rest of her life.
She told me that when she got all through her work in the theater, that she wanted to settle down someplace out here in the West.
By gobs.
Some quiet little place way out on the range, away from all the lights and the crowds.
She kept asking about Texas especially.
She says that ever since she was a little girl, she'd heard about Texas, and it'd always been the dream of her life to have a home here someday.
- She did?
- She did.
Last herd just come in, Judge.
Well?
Huh?
Oh.
By gobs!
A lock of her own hair!
It's kind of dark, ain't it?
Yeah, she uses lots of shampoo on her hair.
She does?
It's beautiful. Beautiful.
I'll never forget this, Cole. Never.
- Let me see it, will you?
- What for?
I ain't going to keep it.
I'd like to see you try.
- All right?
- All right.
I know how you feel, son.
Almighty God, we offer thee thanksgiving for thy help and thy divine bounty.
Thou has poured thy blessings on our land.
Thou hast visited the
Earth and made it plenteous.
Thou hast made it soft with drops of rain,
and the land that was desolate has become like a garden,
and the waste places are become fenced and are inhabited.
Thou hast made the tree of the field yield her fruit,
and the Earth, her increase.
Thou hast broken the bonds of our yoke and delivered us out of the hands of our enemies, so that we shall dwell here safely, and none shall make us afraid, and for this, thy divine bounty,
Oh, Lord, we thank thee. Amen.
Amen.
- Amen.
One foot up and the other foot down
Swing them pretty girls 'round and 'round
Here it is.
- What?
Tell me something first.
Where do you keep my lock of hair?
Oh, uh...
Show me.
Nobody can see that, not even you.
Look, Cole, the best piece of homestead land in the whole country.
It used to belong to one of the hired men that left us, and now it's anybody's. You just claim it.
Yeah, that's a fine piece of land all right.
Yeah, look at the feed on those slopes over there, and that strip along the bottom is just fine for wheat or corn.
And, Cole, look, that little knoll right there, it's just begging for a house.
- Do you know how to build a house?
- No, how?
Well, you... You...
Well, you have the kitchen there, and the bedroom over there, and the living room right in the middle.
It would have to have the right things in it, too.
What sort of things?
Oh, fires and lamplights, warm beds, the smell of coffee in the morning, the sound of rain on the roof.
Gee, that's a nice house, Jane Ellen.
Jane!
Look!
Go to your homes!
Protect your houses!
Hey, Wade, grab another team, we'll take a section of rail fence and knock down a strip of corn.
Maybe we can start a backfire.
Take the two end sections, Wade!
Cole! Cole! Cole!
Hey, get out of here! Move!
Look, the house!
Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Father!
Help! Help!
Come on, hurry up!
- Watch out for his leg and shoulder.
All right.
Take it easy.
- Have you seen Jane Mathews?
No.
So I hereby christen this town Langtry!
No man ever gave a woman a whole town afore, but I'm doing it, and from now on, this whole section's going to bloom like the Jersey Lily herself!
Quiet! I ain't through yet.
Miss Langtry's coming soon to play a night in Fort Davis, and I want every legal resident of Langtry, Texas, to go over and see the godmother of this here town, a town of cattlemen, for cattlemen, and by gobs, run by cattlemen!
Now, in honor of this great occasion,
I'm dishing out free beer to one and all, and anybody found sober after sundown is liable to arrest for disorderly conduct, and that's my ruling!
Start the music!
"And man that is born of woman has but a short time to live.
"He cometh up and is cut down like a flower.
"He fleeth as if it were a shadow, and never continueth in one stay.
"In the midst of life, we are in death. "
The wagon train's left. The people have all gone, Jane Ellen.
I'm staying. Nobody's going to drive me away from my land, not with cattle, or fire, or killing my father, or anything else.
I'll be here long after Bean and his gang of murderers are gone.
Sure you will, and me, too.
I don't want you.
I don't want any of Roy
Bean's friends around.
Wade Harper was right. I didn't believe it then, but I do now.
You knew we were going to be burned out.
That's why you herded all the cattle out, so they wouldn't be burned with our crops.
No, I don't need your help. Not now.
I can do what I have to do alone.
I'll be back.
Why, Cole!
By gobs, man, I'm glad to see you.
Why, I never wanted to see a man so much before in my life.
- What for?
- What for?
Don't you know what for?
She's coming to Fort Davis.
- Lily Langtry's coming to Fort Davis.
- Langtry?
Langtry, yeah, and you and me are going over there together.
You're going to introduce me to her. By gobs, I'm going to meet her.
- I just can't believe it.
- I want to talk to you, Judge.
Yeah, all right. And look what
I got to tell her when I see her.
Langtry, that's the name of this town, a great town after a great woman.
- I said I wanted to talk to you, Judge.
- Sure.
Cole, it's a great day.
I tell you, it's the greatest day in the history of Texas.
- Some fire, huh?
- Yeah, wasn't it, though?
- Yeah, too bad.
- Yeah.
Yep.
- I wonder who was behind it?
- Oh, a fire don't need nothing behind it.
Fire has a way of moving on its own. Here's how.
Before I drink with you, Judge, I want to know you had nothing to do with it.
Me? Why, how can you say a thing like that?
Didn't I round up all them cattle for you?
Wasn't I right here in the saloon when the fire broke out?
Didn't...
Well, I was, and what's more,
I ain't got no idea who done it.
Now, drink up.
- Don't you believe me?
- No.
Now, listen, son, I told you how it was, and I don't want you calling me no liar.
Now, drink hearty.
Will you swear by that?
There ain't no reason I should, but I'm willing.
All right, I swear by my sword there I had nothing to do with it.
I swear by the revised statutes.
By gobs, if there was a Bible in town I'd...
Where's that lock of hair?
- Right here with me.
- Let me see it.
Swear on that?
All right, it was me. I burned their houses and crops.
- I run them varmints out.
- Nice going.
And if you think...
If you think I'm sorry, you're crazy.
I'm proud and glad I rid the country of them.
It was either them or us, and now the range grass will grow back, and some day, the cattlemen will put up a statue of me out there on the street, and they'll write on it,
"Judge Roy Bean, he give us back the land. "
You get warrants in Fort Davis, don't you?
Yeah, that's where they get them, but they don't know how to spell my name.
- It's been tried before.
- I'll get one.
This time, you're going to get what's coming to you, Judge.
Cole!
You and me's friends. I done what I had to, and you think it was wrong.
But if it was my own son come over here with a warrant, he'd have to be first on the draw.
I aim to be, unless I get it in the back before I get out of here.
So long, Cole.
Make out a warrant against Roy Bean.
Raise your right hand.
Do you solemnly swear to carry out the duties of deputy sheriff in Jeff Davis County in the state of Texas?
Yep.
Thanks, Sheriff.
How much are tickets?
$2 apiece, all over the house.
First come, first served.
- How many seats in the house?
- Four hundred.
- I'll take them.
- How many?
All of them.
Much obliged.
Let me have two tickets.
If I was you, Judge, I wouldn't set foot in Fort Davis to see Adam and Eve.
Me, either.
A deputy's star makes the finest kind of a target.
How you know you're not heading into a trap?
Sure looking for trouble, going over to Fort Davis.
Taking an awful chance, Judge.
Them hombres just waiting down there for you.
Why, you pack of yellow bellies, give me them tickets.
You mean, you're going to Fort Davis alone?
Not by a jugful, I ain't.
You're all going with me as a guard of honor, right up to the opera house, but I'm going in alone.
I don't want nobody in there with me no how.
I ain't sharing the Jersey Lily with no one.
Now, come on, we got a day's ride ahead of us.
I'm going to dress, and you fellows proud yourselves up a bit.
Chickenfoot, my sword.
I ain't wore this uniform since Chickamauga, but it still fits right smart.
Bean and his men are coming! Get off the street!
Bean and his men are coming!
Bean's coming! Bean's coming!
Hey, look!
They must have heard I was coming.
All right, boys, take your places.
Hey, this is the stage entrance.
Now, remember, I want strict privacy all during the show.
You'll get it.
Third seat in.
- Pardon, sir, your seat is back here.
- No, it ain't. It's right here.
Say, when does Miss Langtry go on the play?
Right after the curtain.
She's about to go up now, sir.
- Go up?
- The curtain, sir.
Now?
Yes, now.
Now.
Don't make a move, Judge.
I'm coming down to get you.
Come shooting.
- The war's on.
- Yeah.
Wish I was in there to see that show.
- I bet the judge is having a good time.
- Yeah.
Hey!
Let's you and me stand up and shoot it out.
That suits me, Judge.
Put up your gun. We'll draw.
All right.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
Now, you see what you done?
You stopped the show.
I was going to see Lily.
Now it's too late.
No, it isn't, Judge.
She's back there now, waiting to see you.
What?
She knows all about you,
Judge. She wants to meet you.
She told me so herself.
Come on, let's go back and see her.
My hat.
Where's Miss Langtry?
Put me down. I can walk.
Put me down, I tell you. That's my ruling.
Miss Langtry, I'd like to present an old admirer. Judge Roy Bean.
I'm pleased to meet you.
Cole, come here quick!
Look!
See, what did I tell you? They're coming back.
Wagons by the score.
It's the promised land.
Jane Ellen, someday, Texas is going to be the biggest and the finest...
Get up there.
Grandpa, grandpa, look what I done found me.
Whoa, Nelly.
Well now, ain't that the beatenest?
Doggone.
I'll bet that belonged to miss Belle Starr herself.
It looks just like her too.
Who's this miss Belle?
Miss Belle was a mighty fine white lady that lived in this big house a long time ago when I was no bigger than what you is, scarcely.
Where her at now?
- She's gone.
- Dead?
That's what most folks say don't know no better.
But miss Belle, she ain't never going to die
'cause around here in old Missouri miss Belle is what the white folks call a "leggend."
A leggend?
What's that, grandpa?
That's just the prettiest part of the truth, honey, the real bestest part.
Get up, Nelly.
Whoa.
What do y'all want?
I want to see miss Belle.
She asked me to come and see her.
Tell her I said I'm here.
Miss Belle can't see nobody.
She's laying down.
Don't give me any of your black lip.
Go on, do what I said.
I ain't gonna wake up that girl for nobody.
She's all wore out as it is trying to run this whole place by herself with no menfolks to help...
It's all right, mammy Lou. I asked Mr.
Tench to come over.
Don't pay no attention to that trash.
Just go on just like you ain't never seen him.
Here he is, miss Belle, sound as a dollar.
Bet you can't find a scratch or a pimple on him.
How much?
Well now, I figure, seeing how scarce good horses is around here, about $500.
For a horse that's stringhalty, got bowed tendons?
No, ma'am.
He's sound as a dollar.
Besides, I happen to know you stole this horse.
Who, me?
He used to belong to my brother Ed.
But we sold him to Amos Sistrom.
No, ma'am, you're thinking of the wrong animal.
Then Sistrom sold him to John Miller.
And you stole him from Miller.
I'll take my oath on a stack of bibles this high...
But I'm not gonna turn you over to the sheriff this time because Miller's nothing but a Yankee anyhow.
Give me a hand.
Miss Belle, I never stole a horse in my life.
Honest, I ain't.
I've done a heap of things, but this ain't one of them.
I raised this horse ever since he's been a little bitty Colt.
All right.
Give him his $500, mammy Lou, in confederate money.
Confederate?
Wait a minute, miss Belle. I don't want no confederate money.
Miss Belle.
Wait a minute, miss Belle.
I don't want no confederate money.
I got a whole truckload of that stuff.
You know it ain't worth two cents on the dollar.
Belle!
Belle!
Ed!
Belle.
Ed.
Ed, Ed.
Oh, Belle, it's so good to be with you again.
You're home at last.
Ed, you shouldn't be here like this.
Somebody might see you.
That's all right.
Let them see me.
But the country's full of Yankees.
If they catch you in this uniform...
We don't have to worry about Yankees now.
The war's over.
Over?
- We're licked.
- No.
- Lee surrendered.
- But he couldn't.
Joe Johnston’s surrendered too, even old Bedford Forrest.
All right.
Supposing they have.
They're not the whole South.
Missouri hasn't surrendered.
- Not yet, but it will.
- It won't.
It'll have to, or be destroyed.
It won't, I tell you. There are still men in this state.
- Guerrillas?
- I don't care what you call them.
Didn't they hang those Yankee murderers that killed father?
The men that killed father weren't Yankees.
They were renegades hiding behind their uniforms.
They were for the North, weren't they?
Oh, sis,
I know what a shock it is to you.
After all you've been through staying here by yourself, keeping the place going, counting on us to win.
I feel just as badly as you do that it had to end like this on a country road.
But what can we do?
What can any of us do?
It hasn't ended for me.
And Missouri needs reconstruction just like any other rebel state.
And we are gonna give it to them.
We're gonna run every one of these confederate traitors clear out of this country.
And we're gonna take their lands away from them and give every one of you a nice, big farm and a mule.
And we're gonna let you walk on the sidewalk.
And on the front porch you're gonna sit.
And anyone... any white man says anything to you, nothing...
Tom.
Ed Shirley.
Well, don't you shake hands with a Johnny reb?
If you don't mind a yank's glove.
Belle, you remember that funny-looking classmate of mine who used to eat 18 of mammy
Lou's hotcakes for breakfast?
- Belle.
- How do you do, major?
This is wonderful seeing you again, Belle.
- It's been...
- Five years.
Yes, five years this August.
Well, it was quite a surprise when I found out you were here.
The last I heard your outfit was dodging bullets with that fellow down in Atlanta, you know, the one who stole all those spoons.
General Sherman sent me here on special duty.
Seems some of your people don't admit the war's over.
And never will.
I must warn you, Tom.
Belle is one of those southerners who's neither resigned nor repented.
Well, why should she be?
After all, we both fought for what we thought was right.
Nothing about that to be ashamed of.
My only quarrel today is with fellows like this who are in it for only what they can get out of it.
Only last night he raided one of our supply trains, seized our horses and colors and sent me word that he intended to keep up the war until doomsday.
I'm afraid you're making him sound like a very courageous man.
Perhaps he is, but Missouri is no place for such so-called courage today, as he will soon find out if I ever lay hands on him.
And what will you do when this great day comes?
I'll hang him from the highest tree and his friends with him.
Wouldn't that require a great deal of rope?
Fortunately, we have an ample supply.
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'd better be on my way.
How about coming to dinner with us, Tom?
Mammy Lou's still on hand.
I'd be delighted, Ed, anytime.
- Saturday night?
- Can't think of a better time.
- Good.
- Well, goodbye.
It's been a great pleasure seeing you again, Belle.
- Goodbye, Ed.
- Goodbye, Tom.
Let's see...
It's the next one, isn't it?
Strange... I have a vague feeling we've been here before.
They were playing
"good night, ladies."
It was the last dance.
And you were leaving the next morning.
That was so long ago.
I had no idea you even remembered.
Yet nothing seems to have changed, does it?
Nothing that really matters, I mean.
I know how you felt about the Confederacy, Belle, what the South meant to you.
They meant a lot to me too, for that very reason, even though I had on this uniform.
But look, Belle, in the moonlight it's almost Grey.
So it is.
Almost.
What's wrong, dear?
I just remembered something else
I can't help but associate with this tree.
Yes?
Father.
Father was tied to it before... before... you'll have to excuse me, major.
I'm sorry.
Jake, see who it is.
I'll go, miss Belle.
Major, I believe I heard you admiring this room.
I'm in love with the whole house, colonel.
No one who hasn't actually seen some of these old places can have any idea how priceless and beautiful they really are.
That's why it seems such a pity so many of them had to be burned.
Or don't you agree with me, major?
Why, I agree that it's a pity anything beautiful has to be destroyed.
Sometimes one has no choice.
Well, at least it's fortunate for us that you admire old houses.
In some of our states I understand it's practically impossible to find any left to admire.
I hope it will never be necessary to say the same thing about Missouri.
By the way, did I ever tell you the story about the old darky who...?
- Who is it?
- I don't know, ma'am.
It's somebody says they's got to see you.
- Did you tell them we were at dinner?
- Yes, sir, but...
It's all right. Will you excuse me, please?
You wish to see me?
Well, I'll be doggone.
He wasn't lying.
You are pretty as a picture.
I beg your pardon?
The hair, the figure, the face,
I'm very sorry, but I have guests.
Yes, I know. I saw major
Crail's orderly outside.
So if you'll kindly tell me what you want...
I want to know why you're entertaining major Crail, a fire-eating southerner like you...
I'm not entertaining him.
My brother asked him here.
Especially after your defense of me right to his face the other day.
I defended you?
With considerable vehemence, I'm told.
But how could I?
I don't even know who you are.
Well, permit me. My name's Starr,
Sam Starr.
Sam Starr?
You'd better get out of here, white man, and quick.
Please go.
Somebody might see you.
But I've just ridden
40 miles to see you.
Surely you ain't going to send me away the moment I get here. And besides, I wouldn't think of going without paying my respects to major Crail.
You wouldn't dare.
I hear he's very anxious to meet me.
You'd better get out of here and quit aggravating miss Belle.
But I don't understand.
Why should you do such a fool thing as this?
I like doing fool things, don't you?
Don't pay him no attention, miss Belle.
He's crazy as a bedbug.
Well?
Mammy Lou, set another place for captain Starr.
Miss Belle.
Mm mm mm!
Thank you.
I knew any woman who thought it would take a lot of rope to hang my friends wouldn't deny an old soldier a bite to eat.
I wish to present an unexpected but nonetheless welcome guest.
- Mrs. Dunwoody.
- Mrs. Dunwoody.

My brother captain Shirley.
Captain.
Major Crail of the United States army.
Captain Sam Starr.
Won't you sit here, captain, beside me?
I hope I shall always be beside you, ma'am.
Why, captain, what a pretty speech.
Major, perhaps captain Starr can tell us something about those awful men you mentioned the other day... guerrillas I believe you called them.
I shall be glad to have any information that he possesses.
You were referring to...
Certain unscrupulous men who, while pretending to keep up the war, are bringing destruction not only upon themselves but upon the whole state.
I'm afraid I don't know any such men, major.
But I'm sure that if they do exist, you'll see to it they meet the end they deserve.
I think I can promise you that.
I do hope you're hungry, captain.
No one else seems to be eating a thing.
Hungry, ma'am?
I'm starved.
Well, as I was saying, this old darky that I was telling you about lived on a plantation.
And one morning...
I'm sure we can persuade
Mrs. Thornton to play for us.
Then we can dance.
It'll be like old times.
I'm afraid you'll have to excuse me, miss Shirley.
You don't mean you're going to have to leave so early?
Unfortunately I must.
My hat, please, and also captain Starr’s hat.
Captain Starr’s going with me.
But I wouldn't think of letting you both go.
Besides, captain Starr’s promised to tell us about the battle of Jonestown.
Haven't you, captain?
I should like to very much, ma'am, but it appears I have no choice in the matter.
You don't mean you're really going with him?
What else can I do?
So that's why you came here in the first place... to give yourself up.
Well, that's fine.
I'm delighted.
Good night, Tom.
I'm so glad we could be of service to you.
And I hope you'll come again soon.
Captain Shirley, colonel, ladies.
Major.
After you, captain.
Good night.
Your gun, please, captain.
Oh, of course.
Do you have a horse?
Your orderly was kind enough to take care of him.
Orderly, the horses.
I thought you told me that uniform would fit you to a "t".
Well, them Yankees are fatter underneath than they look.
See that major Crail is comfortable till I get back.
Major, what might your religion be?
Methodist.
A northern Methodist or a Southern?
- Northern.
- I was afraid of that.
I'm a "sons and daughters of the heavenly hope" myself.
Just keep your eyes to the front, brother.
I would like for you to come to one of our meetings sometime.
We got a preacher can sure make you smell brimstone.
Captain Starr.
Major Crail sends his compliments, ma'am, and says he's sorry he can't rejoin us.
What happened?
Where is he?
He had to attend to some urgent business, I believe.
Am I forgiven?
By the sound of that music doesn't look like
Sam is gonna be too much in a hurry to come back.
Chaw?
No, thanks.
Shh.
By gum, look yonder.
They got that Yankee major as sure as you're shooting.
Son, you stay here.
Don't let them out of your sight till I get back.
What about our horse you was fixing on stealing back, pa?
Never mind about that.
Do as I tell you.
Besides, ain't I told you stealing what's yours ain't stealing?
Shh.
Good night, captain Starr.
It's been a wonderful evening.
I don't know why it ever had to end.
I hate to go, ma'am, but in my business, the morning air sometimes is not very healthy.
You mean you're afraid Tom
Crail might come back again.
You never can tell after the way he looked at you all through supper.
I didn't notice anyone looking at me one way or another.
I was looking at you.
So was your brother.
In fact, quite a few people were looking at you one way or another.
40 miles is an awful long ride, captain.
And I wouldn't want you to be out in the morning air on my account.
So good night.
Good night.
Was it worth a 40-mile ride?
It was worth a 400-mile ride.
Will you come again?
If you think I'll be welcome.
There's always a place at our table for one more.
Thank you, miss Shirley, and good night.
Good night, captain.
If you should happen to run into major Crail, tell him I think he's awful mean running away like that on business.
Well, major, the way
Sam's laughing, looks like some of your folks are going to get raided
Before breakfast.
Sorry to have kept you waiting, major.
A nice-looking horse you got here, major.
Look out, Sam.
Here they come.
Ain't no sense in you wearing yourself into a frazzle, miss Belle.
You know them Yankees ain't caught captain Starr.
But surely Ed's heard something by now.
He's been gone at least two hours.
Come here.
Come and sit on mammy's lap like you used to.
Oh, my baby.
Mammy Lou, why do things like this always happen to me?
'Cause you're so full of the devil, miss Belle, that's why.
You down there, what do you mean chunking rocks at a lady's window when they's asleep?
Well, I'm one of captain Starr’s men.
He's been shot.
Shot?
Where is he?
You'd better stay out of here, baby.
I'll do whatever's got to be done.
Oh, fiddlesticks.
I know he's got hips.
You ain't supposed to.
Give me that water.
I won't. It's every woman's duty to take care of the wounded.
Duty ain't got nothing to do with it when folks are shot where captain Starr is.
Oh.
There.
What the devil do you think you're going to do?
See how badly you're hurt.
Let me out of here.
There's nothing wrong.
But you can't go around bleeding to death.
Then get Blue Duck a wad of cotton and let us alone.
Grab his hands.
You knew better than bringing me here, you fool.
Don't pay attention to him.
Mammy, you hold his leg.
Get away from me.
Ain't no use, ma'am.
He's plumb set against it.
Acts just like a preacher we had one time.
He got filled full of buckshot the same way.
Took four of us deacons to hold him.
He come out of it all right, next Sunday preached us one of the finest sermons you'd ever want to listen to... on the end of man.
Belle.
Come in.
Captain Starr’s been shot.
And he won't let us do a thing for him.
But, Belle, he can't stay here in your room.
That's what I've been trying to tell her.
But he's hurt. And they'd never even think of looking for him here.
Get that Ethiopian elephant off me.
Let me up.
Everybody be quiet. I'll see if I can get rid of them.
Tom, what are these men doing here?
Mammy Lou, have you been killing chickens today?
No, sir, I ain't killed no chickens in about two months now.
No pigs? Nothing?
November is hog-killing time, not may.
Then how do you account for these blood stains on your lawn?
- Blood stains?
- On our lawn?
Are you hiding someone in this house?
Of course not.
Well, in that case, there can be no objection if we see for ourselves.
Sergeant, search the house.
Now wait a minute, Tom. There's no necessity for that.
We've already told you there was no one here.
I hope for everybody's sake you're right, Ed.
Get out of this house, all of you!
Belle!
Don't think that I can't use this, or that I won't.
It's all right, Belle.
Let him look.
Better put up that gun, Belle.
You're only getting yourself into deeper trouble.
Miss Belle, baby...
I warn you not to come another step.
You don't know this girl, major.
She really meant it when she said she'd shoot.
It was awfully foolish of you to go to all this trouble.
And major Crail might think you had something to do with my being here.
You fool, do you want to be hanged?
Well, a lot of folks think I was born to be.
Major, this is getting to be quite a habit.
Take him out.
I hope he's got an extra saddle blanket, sergeant.
You yanks don't care where you shoot a man.
I'm sorry, Ed, but I'll have to place you under arrest too.
No, wait a minute.
Ed didn't have anything to do with this.
It's all right, Belle.
He wasn't even here when captain Starr came back.
He didn't want to let him stay.
I made him.
Sorry, Belle, I have no choice.
Ed is the head of this household and he's responsible for what goes on in it.
But captain Starr was wounded.
You wouldn't refuse to help even a dog under those circumstances.
Dressing a wound and hiding a fugitive are two different things.
As a soldier, Ed knew that.
That's right, honey.
Take him out.
You, his friend, pretending to be so glad to see us again.
I knew it was a lie.
I knew we should never have let you set foot in here.
My personal feelings have nothing to do with this, Belle.
I have orders from the war department to arrest every person giving aid to... then why don't you arrest me?
And to burn every house in which he's known to have been hiding.
Tom, you don't mean that.
My men will help you remove anything you wish to save, Belle.
I'd give anything in the world to be out of this, but it's my job.
If I don't do it, somebody else will.
I'll give you all the time you want.
All right.
Go ahead.
Burn it!
Burn everything in it.
But you'll burn me with it!
You have your orders.
Miss Belle, miss Belle, baby.
Oh, miss Belle, come on, you've got to get out.
No. No.
Stop it.
Stop it.
Belle, Belle, please go out of the house.
- Belle baby.
- Let me go.
I'd rather burn, burn!
I won't.
I won't.
Honey, honey, won't you do it for mammy Lou?
I don't care!
Please, darling.
I want to burn!
Let me go!
I want to burn!
Where are captain Starr’s men?
Up in the hills.
Do you know how to get in touch with them?
Yes'm, I reckon so.
- Let's go.
- Miss Belle.
You and Jake go over to colonel Thornton's.
Tell him I said you were to stay there until you hear from me.
Who was that?
You don't have to worry, ma'am.
That's just one of the boys' way of saying howdy.
You sure they'll recognize you in that uniform?
Great garden in the sunrise... I clean forgot.
If that's you, Blue Duck, show yourself.
If it ain't, start a-running.
That's my wife, a great woman.
It's me, Sarah.
It's Blue Duck.
Come on, young'un.
It's me, Sarah.
They got Sam.
- Shot him?
- Somewhat.
They arrested him and my brother too.
They oughtn't to have done that.
Folks just naturally ain't going to like it.
When can you get the men together?
I've got to talk to them.
Who is she?
A friend of Sam's and mine.
Name's Belle Shirley.
Well, ma'am, I reckon if I was to light that brush pile there on the hill and keep it burning, they might be here no later than 7:00.
Well, then light it.
Please.
You'd better get that suit off, pa.
Somebody might mistake you for a skunk.

I came here to see my brother.
I was told I'd have to have your permission.
- Is that true?
- Belle, I... well, may I see my brother or not?
I'll be glad to take you to him.
I want you to know that I'm doing everything I can to clear your brother of the charges against him, Belle.
And captain Starr?
There's nothing anyone can do for captain Starr.
You should know that as well as I do, Belle.
- Belle.
- Ed.
Unlock the door.
How are you, captain?
Just fine and dandy, miss Belle.
The government can't seem to do enough for us.
Just look at this supper.
I bet general Grant never ate better than that.
Can we be by ourselves for a few minutes, or is that against orders too?
It's all right, Belle.
You can sit right here.
It's mighty nice of you, major.
Sending your band over to cheer me up in my last moments, so to speak.
A fellow can't help appreciating a thing like that, especially when he's about to come to the end of his rope.

We aim to say a few words to the lord for Sam Starr, brother, before you hang him.
Get that thing out of my ear.
You can't go in there now.
He's busy.
Not too busy to repent, brother.
We always hold all-night meetings before a hanging, brother, just in case the lamb wants to return to the fold.

Well, when am I to be sworn in?
- Into what?
- Your army.
Sorry, I haven't a petticoat brigade.
Well, then form one.
Haven't I enough troubles?
But surely you owe me that much after I saved your life.
What could you do? You've probably never fired a shot in your life.
You could teach me.
Come here, closer.
So that you can put your arms around me?
Well, if you want to learn, the first thing you gotta know is how to make a smooth, quick draw.
In this neck of the woods a man's age is measured by the number of split seconds he can take off his draw like this.
See how I filed off that front sight?
That's so it won't catch in my holster.
And don't stop to aim.
You haven't time for that.
Shoot by sense of direction. Think you can remember that much?
I'll try.
See those leaves over there?
Let's see how close you can come to one of them.
You mean, you want me to try and put a hole through it?
Like this?
Or shall I just cut it off...
...like this?
Well, I guess you'll catch on.
Shall I raise my right hand and kneel?
Now wait a minute, Sam Starr.
There's nothing in the regulations about this.
I mean it, Belle. I've meant it from the first minute I saw you.
I bet you told that to every girl between here and St. Louis.
Saying it and meaning it are two different things.
When I want to be kissed,
I'll let you know.
In the meantime, keep your filthy hands off me.
Hello.
Where are you off to?
- Home.
- Home?
Where else should we be going?
But, Ed, we can't go down there now.
They'll only throw you back in jail again, and me too.
That's no worse than hiding out here in the hills like gophers.
But we don't have to hide out.
We can work with captain Starr, go where he goes.
Is this your idea?
I haven't opened my mouth.
Do you realize you're suggesting that you become a common bandit?
Captain Starr is not a bandit.
He's a soldier.
No matter what you say or what he says, he's an outlaw with a price on his head.
I've thought this all out.
It's no use trying to excuse him or to excuse ourselves.
We've acted like idiots.
Now all we can do is to go back and take our medicine.
That's not true.
Sam's fighting for the South and everything it stands for.
Aren't you?
Of course.
You see?
Haven't you caused enough trouble already?
Why don't you tell her the truth... that you love this sort of thing, that fighting's in your blood, it's what you live for.
If it wasn't for the South, it would be for something else, anything else.
Don't you really mean that
I'm not the kind of man you want your sister to have anything to do with, that I'm not a gentleman, like major Crail, for instance?
You can correct me if I'm wrong, captain.
Or say that he's everything that you believe him to be... you've still got to remember that you're a woman, Belle.
You're my sister.
There isn't anything
I wouldn't do for you except stand by and see you throw your life away.
Now please come home with me before it's too late.
I can't, Ed.
I'll never go back, not as long as there's a Yankee in this state.
It's not just 'cause they killed father, burned our home, threw you in jail.
It's bigger than that.
It's what they're doing to people like us all over the South, what they'll do to Missouri too if we don't stop them.
You won't stop them this way.
You'll only make things worse.
Would you rather crawl to them?
If necessary, yes.
You're my brother, Ed.
I love you.
I love you more than anything.
But if you ever do,
I hope I never see you again.
Now go on, go on home.
And when you see Tom Crail, you can tell him there's one Shirley that isn't afraid of him or the whole North.
It looks as if you've got me in your army, captain, whether you want me or not.
What kind of a man do you think I am?
What do you mean?
How long do you think I can keep my mind on what I'm doing?
I still don't know what you're talking about.
You told me when you wanted me to kiss you you'd tell me so.
Well, I'll tell you when I'm ready.
All right, but I can't go on sitting around doing nothing, just waiting forever.
Well, they lit out, took to the brush as sure as gospel.
I reckon that'll teach them blue bellies to keep out of these here hills on weekdays and Sundays.
Come on, let's get out of here.
I reckon I'm ready now, captain.
I therefore pronounce you husband and wife.
Friends.
Friends, we've had a heap of fun together, but that's nothing to what it's gonna be like from now on.
We've got Crail and his blue bellies on the run and I mean to keep them that way.
That's a-saying it, Sam!
Every day we're getting stronger, folks coming in from all over.
They know me and they know I mean business.
Three months ago they figured all they had to do was stick up a sign warning folks not to have anything to do with me, and I was licked.
Look at them today, willing to pay $10,000 to get their hands on me.
And that's just the beginning.
Before I'm through, I'm gonna run things in this state.
You're doing it, Sam!
And here's the one you can thank for it.
If it hadn't been for her, wouldn't any of us be here.
But the thing is, we are here.
And all I got to say is I sure am glad I ain't a Yankee.

- Howdy, Sarah.
- What you got there?
- A couple fellows want to see Sam.
Did you teach them how to pray yet?
No, but I've got them edging that way.
Get down now.
Here's captain Sam Starr.
What's your names?
Cole. I'm John.
That's my brother Jim.
Cole? You the Cole brothers from Texas?
You know, I'm running things here.
That's why we come.
Folks have been talking about you all over.
What are they saying?
They say that you got the state of
Missouri right where you want it.
What do you think of that, Belle?
Were you ever in the confederate army?
- Yes, ma'am.
- For four years.
We was with Quantrill for a spell, till they got him.
They ain't no command that we've ever been with that done surrendered yet.
You hungry?
We could do with a mite.
Just a little sidemeat or something.
See that these boys get fed and bring them back.
I want to talk to them.
A mighty nice layout you got here, captain.
It's improving.
Belle, what's wrong?
Cole brothers... I can't say as I like their looks.
An army doesn't fight on its looks.
You sound as if you'd heard of them before. Where?
Oh, roundabout.
They got quite a name.
For what?
Fighting.
I don't know, but they don't look like the kind of people who give a hoot about the South and what we're fighting for.
You don't think I'd let them come in if I wasn't sure?
No, but... remember, you can't always tell a patriot by the kind of clothes he wears.
Look at you.
Stop at the next bend.
Sam.
Sam.
Sam.
He ain't here, ma'am.
Where did he go?
He said he had some business to finish down the road a spell.
Said if you woke up to tell you not to worry.
Business?
What sort of business?
I don't know.
Who did he go with?
Them Cole brothers and some more of the boys.
Oh.
Pshaw, you don't have to worry, miss Belle.
He'll be back.
Belle.
Ed.
- Are you alone?
- Yes.
I want to talk to you.
How did you know where to find me?
- Blue Duck told me.
- But nobody's supposed...
You needn't be afraid.
You're still my sister.
What is it you want?
Belle, do you know what's happening, what your men are doing?
Exactly what I told you we'd do, show them Missouri's one place...
I mean the men who've come in here to join you, the scum of this country.
What do you know about the men who've come in here?
I know they're the most notorious gang of cutthroats in the South, men who've never even heard of the Confederacy, who only want to grab what they can for themselves and use you and Sam as a shield.
Did your friend Tom Crail send you up here to say that?
Nobody sent me.
I came because I know you better than you know yourself.
I know you wouldn't knowingly stand for the things that the Cole brothers and men like them are persuading Sam to do.
John and Jim Cole came here to fight with us.
They do exactly what we tell them to do and nothing more.
There isn't any crime you can mention they haven't committed.
And just being with you hasn't changed them. They're no good.
Well, we're not running a Sunday school.
As long as they obey orders.
Has Sam ordered them to rob our own people?
Of course not.
You know as well as I do we've never even touched a cent that didn't belong to the government.
Has he ordered them to beat and shoot innocent citizens who get in their way?
No, but your friend
Tom Crail has when he started taking people's guns away from them so they couldn't protect themselves; throwing them in jail, trying to make them betray us.
Wait, Belle.
I've got to make you wake up to what you and Sam are doing to this state, troops everywhere, radicals in congress howling their heads off for reconstruction, murders, robberies, bitterness, neighbor against neighbor.
Isn't that all the more reason we should stay here and fight?
Try to remember when we were children, Belle, the love we had for each other.
You think I'd lie to you now or do anything to hurt you?
I used to worry about us as individuals.
I don't anymore.
The Shirleys have petered out.
We don't matter.
We are finished.
But Missouri matters.
Come home with me now.
Let me take you to Tom Crail.
Give yourself up.
Take your punishment.
Or go away. Go to Texas.
Go anywhere.
Only let the world know that you won't stand for a lot of outlaws coming in here ruining everything we've loved.
Now you listen to me, Ed.
I'm Sam Starr’s wife.
I love him and he loves me.
I know he wouldn't... he couldn't do the things you say he did.
So please go before he comes back and makes you.
All right, maybe Sam doesn't know.
Only promise me one thing, that you'll ask him.
And try to believe this, no matter what's happened, you'll always be the same sister
I used to know and love.
Nothing can ever change that.
Who is that?
I don't know.
Kind of looks like a stranger to me.
Mighty fine-looking clothes to be wearing up here.
Ed!
Oh, Ed, Ed.
Something's burning me.
I hurt so.
Yes.
Yes, darling, I know, I know.
You called me "darling."
You and I we're just like we used to be.
Aren't we?
Then it's all right.
I don't mind.
Pro... promise me you'll tell Sam what I said.
Tell him I said that I know you love Missouri, that you wouldn't do anything...
I can't die till you promise.
Promise.
Yes.
I promise.
Reminds me of a story
I used to know about an old darky...
Oh, Ed.
Ed.
Belle, what is it?
What's happened?
Oh, Sam, Sam.
Belle darling, what's the matter?
Ed's dead.
Dead?
They... somebody shot him.
Who did it?
What does it matter who did it?
He's dead.
He came up here to tell me that...
Sam, these men, the Coles, some of the others, they're not doing what Ed said, are they?
They're not thieves and robbers, are they?
This is war, Belle.
In a war a lot of things happen that we don't like, but that's what war is.
You didn't answer me.
Sam.
Listen, Belle, we've got 250 men with us and more coming in all the time.
Those men have to be fed, clothed and paid.
You can't expect an army to fight and not get something out of it.
And the only way we can get it is, well, off the land.
But that's stealing.
If they felt about the
South the way we do, why, they wouldn't do that.
They... Sam, we've got to quit now, this very minute.
We've got to go back, give ourselves up.
No matter what happens, we've got to show them that...
Sam.
It's too late.
No, it isn't.
Ed said maybe we could go to Texas.
There are a lot of southerners out there like us.
Oh, Sam, that's what we'll do.
We'll go to Texas.
Sam, you will go, won't you?
You've got to.
Oh, Sam.
As soon as I finish one more job.
What job?
Look at this.
There's one of these sticking on every fence post and hickory tree between here and St. Louis.
Yes, I know, but you wouldn't want the governor to think I'm not red-blooded, would you?
But Sam, you...
Listen, Belle, I know this Johnson.
I know all about him.
I know that if we ever had him for 10 minutes, we could dictate our own terms.
We could run every Yankee clear out of the state, drive out every...
But, Sam, that's kidnapping.
In the army we call that
"taking prisoners."
You'd be insane to go down there now.
Why, there'll be troops everywhere.
They'd wipe you out.
Not the way we got it planned.
Sam, you know I want to fight as much as you do.
I always have.
And I always said if I died, all right, I'd die, but not this way.
Whose idea was this?
Well, the Cole brothers and the rest of...
I knew it.
It's not freedom they want, it's ransom.
Sam, this is our last chance.
Does this mean more to you than I do?
What do you mean by that?
I told you I was quitting.
Stop talking crazy.
You're my wife. You're going to stay right here.
You're not going anywhere.
I couldn't wear this.
Not as long as I knew we didn't think and feel alike.
Belle.
My baby.
Baby, my baby.
Ed's dead.
Oh.
Oh, miss Belle, you'd better come inside and lay down.
Somebody might see you out here.
No no, I'm gonna give myself up.
Miss Belle.
Captain Starr’s gonna do something awful.
I've got to tell them.
It's the only way
I know how to help him.
But you can't give yourself up.
No telling what they might do to you.
I don't care.
Get the buggy.
Go into town see major Crail.
Tell him I'll be waiting for him here.
Oh, I can't do it. Don't ask me to do it, miss Belle.
I just can't do it.
But you've got to.
There isn't a moment to lose.
Yes'm, I'll hurry.
Giddyup.
Giddyup.
- Son, son.
- Yes, pa?
Run right over to the courthouse.
Tell that Yankee major Crail
I got to see him right away.
Tell him I said it's mighty important.
But, pa, I thought they told us to stay off the street.
Go on, do as I said.
Hurry.
Whoa.
Miss Belle!
Miss Belle, they're fixing to get you and captain Sam.
It's a trap. The whole town is full of soldiers with guns, every window, door, ready to shoot the minute you and captain Sam show up.
Where are you going?
I can't let him be killed like this, without even a chance.
I've got to let him know.
No no, miss Belle, it's too late.
They'll get you too.
But he's my husband.
No matter what he's done, he's my husband and I love him.
I know.
I knowed that the very minute you laid eyes on him.
Which way did they go?
They're circling around so as to come in on the other side of town.
Is Blue Duck with them?
He's gone on ahead.
Seems he's to shoot off his gun for a signal if everything ain't all right.
Thanks, Sarah.
Oh, you can't go into town at a time like this.
It doesn't matter. I was gonna give myself up anyhow.
Give up?
It's what Ed really wanted me to do.
Besides, maybe then Sam will quit too.
Tell him... tell him he's got to.
Why, they might hang you.
Ain't no man ever lived worth risking your neck for.
- Any sign of them?
- No, sir.
I went as far as the edge of the river and didn't see a thing.
Very well. Go back to your post and keep your men under cover
- until further orders.
- Yes, sir.
Might be a wild goose chase, colonel.
Might be.
We put those posters where they couldn't help seeing them.
And if I know Sam Starr, he won't pass up an opportunity to raise a rumpus of some sort, shoot up the town or... oh, I know he'll show up.
Well, even if he doesn't, the governor won't complain.
He'll still make his speech.

Huh.
Tell major Crail captain Starr presents his compliments and would like to speak with him.
You can go in now, sir.
I understand you have a woman here who is said to be Belle Starr.
Said to be?
You've seen this woman yourself?
Yes.
But you haven't paid the reward money.
No.
Then I shouldn't advise you to do so until after the identification is complete.
I'm sorry, captain.
As much as I wanted to get Belle,
I never meant it to be like this.
My wife's mammy's outside.
She'll tell you whether this is Belle Starr or not.
May we see her?
Send Jasper Tench into the back room.
This man has shot the wrong woman, major.
- This is not my wife.
- Huh! That's a lie.
You're just saying that so as I won't get the reward.
Ask her.
She'll tell you.
No, sir.
I ain't seen this lady in my whole life before.
She's lying too.
They made it up.
They hate me.
You always hated me too, just like all them Shirleys.
But you ain't gonna get away with it.
I'll go to court.
I'll prove it's her.
I reckon I ought to know.
I shot her.
You know it's her.
I see'd you with her.
I know why you're doing this.
You was in love with her yourself, just like everybody said.
That's why you ain't caught her before.
You was in love with her.
That don't give you no right to cheat me after all I've done for you.
Get out.
Get out of here.
I won't. I want my money.
I'm glad I shot her.
I'm glad. No one'll ever get the best of me.
You take your hands off.
You take your hands off me.
- I'll walk myself.
- Take your...
Major, if you don't mind,
I'd like to have just one more look to make sure.
I understand.
I'll be in my office.
It was all my fault.
If she'd started out differently, with the right kind of man...
No, sir.
No, sir, Mr. Sam.
You oughtn't to say a thing like that.
Miss Belle wouldn't have been happy with nobody else excepting you.
I-I knowed her ever since she was born.
I-I've hold her in my arms.
I knowed her inside out.
Why... why, you's the only man that could have made her happy.
Why, the very last thing she ever said to me was...
"I love him.
I don't care what he'd done.
I loves him."
So... so, Mr. Sam, you oughtn't to say a thing like that.
You're still positive that woman is not Belle Starr?
I'm positive.
I knowed all the time that miss Belle Starr weren't in yonder.
Me too.
In the first place, captain Starr ain't gonna let nobody shoot miss Belle.
And in the second place, it ain't like she's no plain, ordinary human woman like everybody else.
- In the first place...
- She ain't?
Can an ordinary woman change herself into a red fox whenever she wants to?
Can she?
Miss Belle do that?
Sure she do it.
Ain't more than a half hour ago she come lickety-splitting down the road.
And when she seen me, she turned herself right in front of my eyes and ran off laughing fit to kill.
Excepting it ain't no fox's laugh,..
It was miss Belle's.
Well, doggone.
She's what the white folks call a legend.
A legend?
What is a legend?
A legend is something that can change itself over into a red fox when it wants to.
Well, brother, let me tell you one thing, do ever I meet one of them red foxes,
I'm sure gonna take my hat off in a hurry.

- [ laughing ]
I beg your pardon, miss.
I think you dropped this.
Well! thanks, mister.
- Where do you hail from, stranger?
- Boston.
- That some foreign country?
- I'm beginning to think so.
I want a glass of milk.
Plain.
No rum.
And no comments.
I like milk.
- He bent that dollar just like it was butter!
- I'll be a ring-tailed baboon!
What do they feed the cows in that there Boston? Pig iron?
- Scrap.
- [ laughing ]
Everybody jump!
Kegs McKeever is on a tear.
He's got the toothache again!
Whiskey, you cross-eyed bar slop!
Whiskey for this blazing tooth of mine!
Don't gulp it. Just roll it around in your mouth.
Why you interfering blabbermouth!
I got a notion-- got him, boys?
This is the last time you break the peace. Comanche bill's got a busted jaw.
- You broke up the red stallion too!
- Mike's place is a wreck.
You know I'm not responsible when this tooth is aching.
Go ahead and hang me if you want to.
Leastwise I won't have no more pain.
Who said anything about hanging?
I'm gonna pull that durn tooth of yours.
Ohh!
[ Laughing ]
- I don't see the point of no joke.
- I guess there isn't any.
I can fix that tooth if you let me have a look at it.
- A dentist, huh?
- No! I'm no dentist!
I'm a druggist.
If you'll let me put a little painkiller on it--
- painkiller?
- yes.
Quit sashaying around and fix me up!
Well, sit down.
- Open up.
- [ Groans ]
I said open up.
[ Boat whistle ]
- What was that?
- Partly me and partly the Sacramento boat whistle.
Come on, man, because i gotta catch that boat.
I can't. I'm afraid.
Even looking at it might hurt.
Then I'll have to give you something.
Something that'll really settle your nerves.
Just take a whiff of this, and think of something pleasant.
You mean like bees a-singin' and birds a-buzzin'?
That's right.
Ohh, I hear cowbells!
That'll fix him up.
He'll sleep for a while.
- Did he say he'd sleep for a while?
- Sounded something similar.
[ Snorts ]
- We better make a run for it, youngster.
- Nope, we got time.
The marianne always whistles her head off to get folks out of the saloon.
Make way, folks! Make way.
Thank you, thank you.
Make way for miss Lacy Miller, the sweetest singer in Sacramento.
Make way.
People are staring because they've never seen a bathtub before.
- Silly. ain't worth the look.
- Don't be so common!
[ Man ] make way, folks.
Thank you.
All they need is a brass band.
Take it easy with that tub.
It's real porcelain.
My, oh my!
Ain't the lady gonna look pretty sitting in that.
[ Gunshot ] any more remarks?
- You dang fool, that's brit Dawson.
- Get outta here!
Bring the tub through, boys.
Take it all the way across.
Don't drop it in that mud.
- Lacy, you can't set foot in that.
- Not with my new slippers.
Wait till I tear up a sidewalk.
He knows i hate waiting.
Take this on board, youngster.
All ladies hate waiting, so they shouldn't be made to wait.
- Put me down!
- Nonsense! It's ankle deep!
I'm Lacy Miller.
Nobody ever dared pick me up like this before.
Happy to know you.
My name's Craig, Tom Craig.
Lately of Boston.
The sooner you get back there, the safer, stranger.
I don't know.
I'm beginning to like the west.
That'll teach you to lay hands on the lady i aim to marry!
Oh! in that case, i offer my sincerest apologies.
- Apologies for walloping ya?
- No! For treating your bride-to-be like a package.
What kind of lingo is this?
He's from Boston.
Which means I'm ignorant of the customs here.
In Boston, it's considered good manners to carry a lady...
- Across a muddy street.
- And you had to tear up a sidewalk!
- This ain't Boston!
- Don't let that worry you.
Where's my hat?
- Here you are, mister.
- And here you are, Sonny.
Wait a minute.
I'll bend it for luck.
- [ Boy ] hey, look at what he's doin'!
- That's downright pretty!
- If that don't beat all!
- I've seen everything.
I'll take you to your cabin.
Thank you, sir, for your elegant assistance.
- The pleasure was all mine.
- Cut the palaver.

Raise up your gangplank.
[ Chattering ]
You lazy swobs!
Well, here I am.
You sure are. How's your tooth?
Whatever you did to my tooth stopped it achin'.
Whatever I can do for you in return, I'll do.
Wherever you go in this whole world, I'm goin' with ya.
- Sounds like a nice, quiet life.
- But you don't understand.
When I haven't got a toothache,
I'm as gentle as a dove.
But when I got one,
I'm a raging, ferocious, longhaired sea lion a-roarin' for my prey!
A-roarin'?
- A-roarin'!
- in that case, I'll keep my painkiller handy.
Whoa.
Where do we sleep?
Come on.
- I wish brit was more polite.
- Like they are in Boston?
His voice is so loud, and when he talks he sounds like a cowhand.
Who, Boston?
No, brit.
And I never saw him bend a silver dollar like that.
I wouldn't think too much about that stranger.
Brit might not like it.
And if brit don't like a thing, life gets kinda untidy.
- What is it I won't like?
- It's manners to knock on a lady's door.
- I was asking a question.
- Oh, yes, Lacy was pondering about the house you're building.
I said you mightn't like red carpet.
And I said you'd give me anything I wanted.
Of course I would.
Gold carpets if you wanted 'em.
[ Dawson ]
what do you say we don't wait
for the house to be finished?
- Let's get married right away.
- No. You promised to wait until the house was finished, and everything the way I wanted before we tied the knot.
I got you the bathtub, didn't I?
That's nothing!
I want cut-glass chandeliers and gold doorknobs.
- [ Man ] hey, brit!
- Oh.
- I just heard Collin's on board.
- Collin!
Here's where I get you the gold carpets.
Ah! it's a good thing i have quick wits!
Don't worry about brit.
I can twist him right around my little finger.
Uh-huh. but someday he might bite the hand that twists him.
- [ Chuckles ]
- [ chuckles mockingly ]
In here.
You two wait out here.
- Hello, Collin.
- I told you I don't want nothin' to do with ya.
You're a mighty hard man to do business with.
Up in Sacramento, you keep so many men around, there's no privacy.
And you light out for frisco without leaving a word!
We got no business to talk about, and that's final.
Here's $1,000.
And here's a receipt for half interest in your ranch.
I'm buyin' in like I said.
That wouldn't pay for one quarter of the stock and you know it.
I'm a-warnin' ya.
You ain't holding me up...
Like you did Hernandez,
markson and treadwell.
I'm waitin' for you to sign that receipt.
- Get out of my cabin!
- [ Laughs ]
[ Gunshot ]
What was the shot?
- Brit's a little busy in there.
- Oh, brit.
Someone hurt?
Wait. I wouldn't go in there unless you wanna be knocked down again by brit Dawson.
Really?
Where do you think you're going?
- Could I be of any assistance?
- Why?
- I heard the shot and--
- oh, you a sawbones?
No, I'm a pharmacist. Druggist to you.
Oh, a pill peddler! That's rich.
Come on in, have yourself a good time.
Sit down.
- How did this happen?
- The clumsy galoot...
Grabbed his gun by the barrel, struck it against something, and it went off in his hand.
- That's how it happened,
eh, Collin?
- Yeah.
A fellow as careless as that oughtn't to own a gun.
So be more careful in the future, friend.
Is it very bad, doc?
It's only a flesh wound.
Now tell me, how did it really happen?
- You heard Dawson.
- But somehow, i don't quite believe him.
You better.
And not only that, we're gonna have lace curtains on every single window.
And red carpets on every floor.
And two bathrooms!
Including the one
with the tub in it.
Eh, Lacy?
Why, brit, you don't have to tell folks about our plumbing.
You'll have Boston thinking we got no class in Sacramento.
It'll be more dressy when he's joined us.
That is, if you aim to stay.
I aim to.
I'm gonna open a drugstore.
That's just what we need up there to make us amount to something, ain't it?
They'll need it all right, if you continue to be so quick on the draw.
How do you mean?
I don't see how even a clumsy galoot...
Could shoot himself in his own right hand.
- Is that a polite way of calling me a liar?
- He didn't call you anything.
Don't you mix in this.
I asked you a question.
Let's say your version of how it happened...
Shows a great deal of imagination.
- A fancy way of saying you don't believe me, huh?
- Frankly, it is.
Now, brit!
[ Water splashing ]
[ Laughing ]
You can't do this to my friend!
- Oh, no?
- No, you can't-- wait, Boston,
I'm coming with ya!
[ Water splashing ]
Take your choice.
Anyone can have a bath or a drink on me.
Here's my notion.
We don't want that pill peddler in Sacramento.
And if he turns up, anyone who calls himself my friend will run him out of town.
Come, Lacy.
Come on, folks, let's wet our windpipes.
Aah.
Well, where do we go from here, pal?
- Sacramento.
- Sacramento?
- Well, what about it?
- No good, kegs. He won't rent.
Let's sashay along to a friendlier town.
I'm gonna rent a shop in Sacramento if I have to pay somebody into bein' my landlord.

- Yes. You oughtn't to give way to the outbursts of temper.
It's bad for you.
Accelerates the pulse,
overworks the heart.
Gives you indigestion.
You're not sore at what happened?
Why should I be? You didn't
 really interfere with my plans.
I'm in Sacramento, and opening my drugstore.
Here you are.
Mr. Craig, could you recommend some rubbing oil for tomkins's shoulder?
I think so.
Put a teaspoon of this in a pint of boiling water and apply it.
Don't rub it in or you'll take the skin off him.
- Sometimes I've wanted to do just that.
- Not with anything from my shop.
Your tonics may be tonics, but i can't get Archie to take this, so I'll take my money back.
- What's the matter with it, Archie?
- Don't like it.
That's too bad.
I was raised on that fine old remedy.
It's a great muscle builder too.
- Gee, lookit!
- For land sakes!
- We'll take it back, ma.
- Get me one, ma. Get two!
- Two?
- yeah, I got a date to fight Archie.
[ Laughing ]
- Well, what are you doing out here that's so useful?
- Just admiring your washing.
You get shirts nice and clean.
I don't know how i ever got along without you.
- That's the last washing I'm doing for you.
- How's that?
A single girl can't do for a fellow regular without people talkin'.
- I got my good name to consider.
- Talking? Saying what?
Nothin', just askin' if you and I are aimin' to get hitched.
You better get outta here quick and permanent.
I see.
Well, I think I'll get in the laundry first.
- What are you doing with my gun?
- I used to be a pretty shot. Excuse me.
[ Gunshots ]
Thank you.
Any questions?
Helga, be mine!
Why, kegsie, this is such a surprise!
- Now that you've seen the whole town, Ellen--
- what do you think?
Haven't seen a man
I'd sit at the same dinner table with.
- Naturally the settlers are rather crude, but--
- good heavens, who's that?
A singer from the dance hall.
Looks like she just escaped from a birdcage.
And over there is the new drugstore.
And is that, by any chance, the new druggist?
- I'm sure I hope you'll make a success of it.
- Thank you, Mrs.--
- Coggins, is the name.
- Coggins.
That's a downright shame to saddle a pretty girl with a name like that.
- Somebody oughta change it for her.
- Coggins is my name, young man.
Yes. huh? Oh! Sorry.
Is this the new drugstore everybody in town's talkin' about?
Hey, look out!
Look out!
What are you tryin' to do?
Run me down?
- Think she owns the street!
- Quiet, you're scaring the horse.
I feel faint.
Ellen!
She's fainted!
Ellen handles horses like a man.
She's never afraid!
Yes, it's very odd.
What can we do?
Go in the back room and get some water. Hold her.
I'm all right. It must've been a touch of the sun.
There's not enough sun out to warm a rattlesnake.
And that's how i bid good-bye to San Francisco.
So you didn't like my home town.
I didn't see the best part of it until you came to Sacramento.
- Ooh, fried chicken!
- Men always like fried chicken, don't they?
It's all I need to make life perfect and complete.
That is, practically all.
- Certainly is a beautiful view, isn't it?
- It certainly is.
Hey, Boston, you're wanted at the store.
The man's here from San Francisco with the medical supplies.
- Why does Tom have to go?
- He won't leave them unless he checks the list.
He would pick my one day off.
It's a good thing you didn't bring anything hot.
It might get cold.

Senor Hernandez, get me a glass of punch, por favor.
For me too, Jose.
I'm sure he'll propose to her tonight.
But Ellen won't accept.
She doesn't love him.
Now what are you two saying about me?
We were talking about you and Mr. Craig.
- Has he proposed yet?
- No, but he will before the evening's over.
He's very much in love with you.
He will be terribly sad when you say no.
- Who's saying no?
- But you don't love him.
What if I don't?
You girls are so old-fashioned.
He's good-looking, and a gentleman.
With my father's backing, i can make him a big man in San Francisco.
Is the young lady present
who promised me this dance?
Why I'd forgotten all about you.
Pardon.
Ellen?
I, uh-- this is the first time--
- are you in the mood for a very important question?
- I guess I'm in the mood.
Then I'm gonna ask you right here and now if--
Tom, will you please go in the house and get my fan?
- Before I ask you the question?
- Yes, please.
It's on the chest in the hall.
Well, all right.
- Oh, hello.
- What is it this time?
- I'm looking for Tom Craig.
- With some other trumped-up call to the drugstore?
- You don't fool me one bit.
- Funny. I see through you too.
Throwing yourself at his head.
Trailing him like a bloodhound.
Now even trying to poke your nose in here. Haven't you any pride?
No. but at least I never pulled a fake faint on him.
Why you cheap painted hussy!
Well, thank goodness I am not lady enough to hit anybody.
Here's your fan.
Oh, hello, Lacy.
Who wants to see me now?
Old man Higgins is very sick.
His boy's at the drugstore and won't leave until you get there.
I guess I'd better go.
Of course you must go!
I hope it isn't serious.
Don't forget.
I'll be at the dock to see you off, and ask that question.
Good-bye till then.
Good night, miss Miller.
Night.
She has a remarkably sweet disposition.
Yes, I've never met anything quite like it.
Lacy, wait a minute. I wanna--
I told you about Higgins, and that's all I came for.
Here you are, Sonny.
The directions are on the label.
If he doesn't feel better in the morning, let me know.
Boston! Boston!
Hey, what's wrong now?
It's the Dawsons. They're on a land-grabbing tear.
The Peterson's house is burning, and the libberts were driv' out.
And with only with what they stood up in.
Doesn't anybody fight back around here?
What's one man agin that whole gang?
Can't we get 'em together?
Shake a leg, kid. They were on their way to your house.
My pa's not able to lift a hand.
We'll get you some help.
Let's round up some neighbors and give the Dawsons a reception.
- Come on, kegs. Are you with us?
- You're darn tootin'!
Tomkins! tomkins!
- Here, here, here!
What in tarnation--
- the Dawsons are ridin'.
We're gonna try to stop 'em at the Higgins place.
Will you come along?
- Soon as I get my pants on.
- Good.
- Hey, bates! Carlin.
- Who's there?
What's the matter?
Ride over to the Higgins's.
We're gettin' up a hot reception for the Dawsons.
It's about time! I'll be right along.
Shake a leg, and don't lose any time doin' it!
I'll be there!
- Meet ya at the Higgins place.
- Right.
- Hide the horses around back of the house.
- All right.
- Hello, Archie. Hello, Mrs. Higgins.
- Hello, Mr. bates.
- How are you, boy?
- Not so good.
Sure glad you got here. You can help us get pa into the wagon.
He hadn't oughta leave the house.
Let's take him up in the loft.
- Up the ladder?
- Sure! Take the younguns, and go up ahead.
- Step smart, children.
We'll get him up.
- Mister, give me a hand.
Hurry up, ma.
Fine time for me to be laid up.
That's all right.
Go on, Archie.
- Hey, they're here.
- I can hear 'em.
Where in tarnation is Craig and the rest of them?
We're no match for the gang!
[ Pounding on door ]
- Higgins, open up!
- What are we gonna do?
Stall 'em someway.
[ Meows ]
[ Pounding on door continues ]
- Get in there.
- What?
- You're gonna have a baby.
- Baby?
Ooh, get out!
I'll have it.
- And I ain't even married.
- Shh!
Higgins!
[ pounding on door ]
What are you doin' here?
- I might ask you the same question.
- I'm looking for Higgins.
- He ain't here.
- Where'd he go this time of night?
Look who just rode up.
Packin' a gun too.
- Isn't that the custom in this country?
- Quite a gathering here tonight.
- I heard Mr. Higgins was ill.
- Not mister!
- The missus.
- The missus?
- Yes. mister went up the river to get a doctor.
- Oh!
Don't get too close.
It might be catching.
Don't be afraid
of catching that, Dawson.
She's having a baby.
Lie still, Mrs. Higgins.
I'll heat some rocks to put at your feet.
- She been suffering much?
- Not yet.
But you can never tell about a woman like Mrs. Higgins.
- She'd die before she'd even let out a whimper.
- Yes, yes.
How insignificant is man when confronted with the divine mystery of birth, and the courage of a woman like that.
I don't suppose that means anything to you!
Nobody can say brit Dawson don't respect motherhood.
Don't worry, ma'am, we'll wait for your ol' man outside.
Aa-choo!
I'll show you how I respect a mother!
Why you fast-talkin', son of a coyote!
We're in trouble. There's a crowd comin' over the hill.
Come on!
Hightail it outta here!
[ Laughing ] tell 'em again how you stalled 'em, kegs.
Bates told Dawson i was gonna have a baby.
Hello, mama!
I bet brit and Joe are boilin' mad by now.
Boilin' at Craig, anyhow.
He gets all the credit
for them being driv' off.
About time they got a dose of their medicine.
The prescription's simple.
You take a bunch of angry men defending their homes, mix well and serve hot.
- To the Dawsons.
- Let's drink to the cure of the Dawson disease.
And let's always make it
Craig's prescription!
Something's wrong.
Brit and Joe are stalking behind the drugstore, and they ain't looking for pills.
I'll run over. Keep Boston here even if you gotta hogtie him.
- They're still inside whoopin' it up.
- He's gotta come out sometime.
Hello, Lacy. Takin' the air kinda late, ain't ya?
- Who are you and Joe waiting for?
- Me and Joe?
Taking the air ourselves.
With your gun drawn so you don't feel chilly?
We're waiting for your friend Craig.
He interfered with business we had at the Higgins place, but his interfering days are over.
- He was there because the old man was sick.
- It's no go.
He was there, and he made fools out of us.
So you better mooch out of the way of any shooting.
All right. But I may as well warn you.
If you harm him in any way, you're out of my life for good.
Seems to me you're mighty upset about your business partner.
She's stuck on him, that's why.
You keep out of this. Well, Lacy?
Sure, I'm upset. I kinda feel responsible for him.
If I hadn't wanted to make money out of the drugstore, he wouldn't be here.
And if you lay a hand on him, we're through.
All right, Lacy. You win.
You know I wouldn't do anything to lose you.
Sweet singin' coyotes!
Why, brit, you're a real gentleman.
That being the case, allow me the honor to escort you back to the palace...
Stylish, like they do in Boston.
Good night, madam. Sweet dreams.
- How's that for manners?
- Fine, brit, and thanks.
What's your hurry?
Never thought you'd be henpecked into being a softy.
- Can't you see she's lyin', trying to save Craig's hide?
- Of course she's lying.
She means that about not marrying me if anything happens to him.
So this has to be done some way she doesn't know i have a hand in it.
Let me do it. It'd be a pleasure.
No, she'd lay it to me just the same. This is gonna be a smart one.
Like the time we got the Johnsons for stealing their own cattle.
Say, there's a tonic he's been pouring down everybody.
Sure. that whole shebang that gave us the shootin' party take it.
That's right. You wait here.
I got a notion to take a swig of this, I'm so weak-like.
You're strong enough for me, kegsie-wegsie.
Plenty strong.
When I get a toothache,
I'm too strong for any sheriff's posse too.
Which reminds me, Helga.
I ain't fit to marry no woman, no matter how good a shot she is.
If you have a reason, it better be good.
- Well... it's this tooth.
- Hmm.
When I get a toothache,
I'm a raging bull.
I shoot up joints. I throw bartenders out of windows.
I slap widows. I kick babies.
- I'm a terror.
- I'll bet.
I'm liable to throw you off a roof.
I'm liable to cut
your head off with an ax.
So you see, I just can't let you marry me, Helga.
Oh, you can't?
Well, it's on account of my tooth.
- You're too fine a woman for such a fate.
- Mmm.
Just the mention of it starts it aching... a mite.
If that's the case, you better go in the back room and have a nap.
- I'll finish everything out here.
- That's fine of you to take it that way.
Oh, think nothing of it.
[ Boat whistle blowing ]
Ellen!
Oh, I'm sorry.
Wait a minute!
Don't go on board.
Hello, everybody. Have an apple?
If you'll excuse me,
I'd like to speak to Ellen.
Senor, it is not proper without a chaperone.
Then we'll make it a family session.
By now, you know that I love you, and I want to marry you.
- Why, Tom!
- Don't say this is so sudden.
You've seen this coming for a long time.
It is correct only to make the proposal to the parent.
When she produces a parent,
I'll gladly propose to him.
But right now, what do you say?
I'll ask father as soon
as I get to San Francisco.
While we're waiting for his consent, why don't you say yes, anyway?
Yes, anyway.
[ Boat whistle blows ] senor.
This is highly irregular!
[ Man ] all aboard
for San Francisco.
- Ellen, hurry. You're going to miss your boat.
- Los americanos.
Pretty, isn't it?
Oh, hello.
- I saw you from the road.
- That's fine.
- What are you doing?
- Thinking.
- What about?
- A man in Boston.
- Oh.
- he was my roommate in school.
Skinny galoot.
Always talkin' about fate.
You know, the thing that makes you suddenly decide...
Not to take a certain train but to take another one, and the one you missed is wrecked.
Or maybe the one you took is wrecked, and you'd have been safe on the other one.
- Scary, isn't it, when you get to thinking about it?
- Yep.
Particularly when you think of how little things can change your whole life.
I know what you mean.
You go along following a sort of--
- pattern?
- yes. Then suddenly something happens...
That doesn't seem to amount to anything at the time.
No. but when you look back, you can trace it and say...
- The change began right then.
- That's it.
Boston, are you trying to make up your mind about something?
Oh, no. I'm just thanking my lucky stars I did what I did six months ago.
The day before I left Boston,
a man offered to set me up
in business on a big scale.
Common sense told me i should take it.
But something else told me to go on to California like I'd planned.
I didn't even take a day to think it over. I just left, and traveled 3,000 miles, and arrived just in time to catch a boat you were on.
If I'd have started a day
sooner or a day later,
I might've missed you and the girl I'm gonna marry.
And the strangest part
of it is...
That I didn't settle
in San Francisco
where she lives,
but I picked Sacramento
where she came on a visit.
[ Laughs ] that's one for Charlie's books.
Who's Charlie?
The man in Boston.
So it was serious with you and her.
Plenty serious.
Good luck, Boston.
- What do you want, whitey?
- I want a drink.
We don't sell liquor here.
Roll into the palace.
They just rolled me out of there.
There's no more credit.
What's in them bottles?
Ain't that liquor?
That's tonic waitin' to be delivered to respectable folk.
Get yourself out of here.
- Go on. Scat. Git!
- I'm a-goin'.
[ Door shuts ] the idea!
[ Snoring ]
[ Kegs yelling ]
Ooh, my tooth!
That's a dirty trick, creeping up on an innocent man in his sleep.
March. mustn't keep the preacher waiting.
Preacher? he won't be in now.
- Come back here!
- Yes, dear.
The preacher is in and your tooth is out.
- So pick up those feet or my handbag might go off.
- Yes, honey.
That's better. Howdy.
Well, here's to ya, Ezra.
Wanna stop in at the store?
No, thanks. You can set me down at the palace.
- [ Crowd shouting ]
- Tom, look!
What's happened? What's the crowd for?
[ Excited chattering ]
- Here he comes now!
- There he is!
- What's wrong here?
- Plenty.
- You've got a mite of explaining to do.
- What sort of explaining?
How come whitey's layin' dead in his store?
- With a bottle of Craig's mixture by him empty.
- That's right!
Don't be too long explainin' or--
[ chattering ]
- What's goin' on here?
- Whitey's been murdered.
- By poison.
- Poison?
- He's dead.
- Let's find out.
- He's dead, all right.
- By what means, druggist?
- Poison.
- [ crowd gasps ]
Must've been enough laudanum in that bottle to kill a mule.
- How'd it get there?
- I don't know.
- Let me through. Let me pass.
- Quit shoving.
This is a free show for all of us, miss Lacy.
Well, Craig?
- They've been tampered with, every one of them.
- Can you explain how?
Someone poured laudanum in this bottle I mix the prescription in.
- You keep laudanum in this shop?
- Of course. This is a drugstore.
- Just a minute. Mr. Craig has been a friend to everyone.
- Mind your own business, Eli.
[ Men shouting ]
[ Knocks on table ] wait.
- Proceed, bates.
- You use it to mix medicine for folks?
Yes, but only a few drops at a time.
Your hand slipped this time, druggist.
I don't say this man's done it intentional, but he made a mistake that could've killed half of this town.
- It's happened. Look at that crowd.
- Sizeable and sore.
[ Excited chattering ]
- What's going on?
- They're trying the druggist for poisoning whitey.
- Come on, let's get inside.
- No. Better not mix in.
[ Man ] it might've been my kid.
Sounds like they'll be bringin' him out in a minute.
[ Shouting ]
- Get a rope!
- Get that buggy down by the big tree.
- You're not gonna use my rig for any lynching.
- Use Jim's buckboard.
[ Excited chattering ]
Let me through!
Tom!
- Tom! Tom!
- Put him up there.
Put him on the wagon.
There she is, fightin' like a wildcat to save that pill peddler.
- No fightin' will save him now.
- Get that rope around him.
Gold! gold!
- Gold!
- where'd you find it?
- Let me see it.
[ Excited chattering ]
Gold! look at it.
They're picking it up in chunks.
- What are you waitin' for?
- Huh? I'm your friend.
So you're gonna stand around here and watch me hang...
When you could be out grabbing yourself a rich claim?
- [ Shouting ]
- forget friendship.
That fella's talkin' about gold.
Gold that you can buy
anything in the world with.
Kegsie, gold!
Gold lying on the ground,
waitin' for you to pick it up.
Now, get out of here...
- Before everybody in California beats you to it.
- Gold! Everybody, gold!
I'm gonna be the first one to stake a claim!
I'm gonna stake a claim right away. Follow me.
Come on.
Let's get gold! Come on.
- Gold!
- [ excited chattering ]
Gold at sutter's mill!
- That fellow has the devil's own luck.
- Yeah, sure.
What are we hangin' around for?
Let's get in on that gold rap.
Come on. He'll keep.
You're right.
I can come back and get him.
With the gold mine for Lacy to dry her eyes on, she won't feel so bad.
At sutter's mill there's gold!
Gold at sutter's mill!
Boy, that's as near to a funeral as I ever wanna get!
If you hadn't pulled my tooth, I could've gotten mad enough to handle that crowd.
- What are you doin'?
- Oh, we're married.
Yeah, we are.
- Huh! ain't he wonderful?
- [ Laughing ]
That's my man.
Here you are! Get your utensils for pannin' gold!
Pots and pans, all prices, all sizes.
- That one'll cost you two bags of gold dust.
- That's outrageous.
Cheapest in Sacramento.
There's a run on pans same as there is on gold.
Come on, folks, get your pans.
What luck did you have with the bighorn that calls himself our town marshal?
He refused to open the case.
So that's what he calls brinin' in law and order?
- Did you come right out and accuse Dawson?
- Certainly.
But all bighorn would say is,
"i ain't interested in your personal feuds."
Well, I guess that closes up our business permanent, huh?
Brit isn't coming back and holler to this town that Craig's innocent.
No, but he's comin' back, all right,
'cause I'm still walking around.
But as far as this store goes, we might as well admit it.
We're whipped.
Write "closed" on the window.
- Cologne soap?
- We might as well finish in style.
Clem, you and pike take the bags of dust to the palace safe.
Chick and I are gonna pay a call on the pill peddler.
Too bad Joe ain't here to see the fun.
He's having fun seein' folks don't cut in on our claim.
Closed, huh? Had to skip town.
Ain't that a pity?
Too bad you can't say good-bye personal.
Let's make the closing official.
[ Gunshots, glass shattering ]
It's our friend Dawson.
- Hello, Lacy.
- Brit!
Bust my britches, but you're prettier than ever.
Glad to see me?
- Sure, but you don't have to squeeze the life out of me.
- [ Chuckles ]
- You'll be a sight gladder when you've seen what I brought ya.
- [ Gasps ]
Jumpin' coyotes! Where did you get such large nuggets?
From the claim up at bogus thunder.
Come on, drinks on the house.
- Yes, sir.
- For everybody.
For you and me, too, honey, to celebrate the pill peddler's departure.
I think you're a bit previous, brit.
[ Brit ] well, well. Craig.
I figured you were halfway to
Boston by now with your tail between your legs.
You figured a lot of things wrong, Dawson.
[ Shouting ]
[ Gunshot ]
Brit, stop it! Stop it, someone!
Are you ready to talk, Dawson?
You're gonna tell these people who doctored the medicine that killed poor whitey.
What's going on? Break it up.
Get him off of there.
- Don't pay any attention to him. He's crazy.
- This man committed murder.
I'm not concerned with any arguments that happened before I took over the law here.
I rule this fight broke up permanent, and I'll slam both of you in the calaboose...
- If you don't keep away from each other.
- Not till I make him talk.
Grab him, deputies, grab him!
For assault, battery, ignoring, disregardin' the law...
And pushin' a United States marshal around, 60 days!
- Now, march!
- [ Deputy ] Come on.
What did you have to call the marshal for?
- Tom had brit ready to sing his song.
- Yeah.
Come on, set up those drinks I was orderin' before this squall blew up.
Step up, folks, and wet your windpipes.
Ahh! what's the matter, Lacy?
Ain't you thirsty?
- [ Laughing ]
- you wanna tell me your joke?
What's the idea of throwing this back at me?
I don't want it or anything else from you from now on.
Because I had a fight with your pill peddler?
No. something a little more important than that.
Where do you think you're going?
Anywhere from here.
I'm not particular.
Lacy, I gotta know the reason for this.
The reason is the way whitey died.
He died because your high-snootin' friend from Boston doesn't know his business.
No, but up to now i must admit you had me fooled.
I might've known you were behind this lynching.
You were the only person in town who had anything against him.
- Did he teach you to say this?
- No, he didn't say a word.
He's much too decent.
So let go of my arm.
I want to finish packing.
Listen, Lacy, I don't admit monkeying with anything.
What I can't get is why you're takin' on like this.
I've killed men before!
Yeah, but shootin' out in the open has something square and fair about it.
Killing with poison is sneaky and lowdown.
Look here, Lacy.
What's come over you?
I tell you, I had nothing to do with it.
Let's forget it and start over again.
I struck it awful rich. I can give you those gold doorknobs you were talking about.
Let me go. If you kept me here till doomsday, it wouldn't make any difference.
Go to your quack pill peddler.
He can have you, and welcome!
This scheme of going to the camps is wrong, and I won't have no part of it!
Rest your tonsils.
We're a-goin', and you're comin'.
- Take this.
- Why don't you use some tact?
- Let her go in there and say good-bye.
- What-- maybe you're right, but it ain't gonna do any good as far as she's concerned.
He's always acted more like a hitchin' post than a two-legged man.
- [ Squawking ]
- ah, shut up.
Hello, there, Boston.
Why, Lacy, don't you look grand.
It's just a little traveling outfit Helga and I ran up.
- You're going someplace?
- To the gold mines with the rest of the world.
Thought I'd say good-bye.
- You're gonna dig gold?
- Sure am.
The easy way.
Out of miners' pockets.
Figured they needed entertainment now.
Can't sit in the back
of an empty drugstore
for the rest of my life.
I'm sorry our partnership was such a failure.
Oh, that. I don't regret any of it.
That a letter from San Francisco?
Oh, yes. I'll be leaving soon too.
Ellen's coming up, and
we're going back together.
Oh.
- Good luck, Boston.
- You too, Lacy.
If you ever get to San Francisco-- oh, yes.
Drop in and have dinner with you and the wife.
No, thanks. I'm just hoping that I never see you again.
- Why?
- don't you know?
You're makin' me shove off, leaving Boston with no one to look after him.
He'll do fine once he's hitched to miss snippety-puss up to frisco.
Listen, you two.
I don't want to hear any more talk about him.
I want to forget I ever set eyes on him. I don't want to hear his name mentioned again.
- Boston. [ squawks ]
- Shut up!
Quiet. shh.
- Hey, partner.
- What do you want, lady?
- How big a camp is this?
- Was 30 shacks or so till folks started to sicken.
You all look puny, as if you could do with a good meal and some sleep.
Giddyap! they need entertainment like a dead horse needs flies.
- What's the name of this camp?
- Brandy gulch.
Did you pass a doctor on the trail up?
- A short, stubby fellow with gray hair?
- No. Is anybody sick?
Anybody sick?
[ Laughs ]
Half the camp's down with the fever.
Hello, there!
- Are you from Sacramento?
- Why, yes.
I'm Dr. clagham. Did you bring those medical supplies?
- What supplies?
- What supplies?
Howlin' coyotes!
Don't they know we've got an epidemic on our hands?
- Epidemic?
- yes. Typhoid fever.
And we got no drugs to treat it.
We got no food or comforts.
In every camp for miles around men are dying like flies.
Doctor, you gotta save Carson.
You can't leave him like this, burning and raving with fever.
You gotta do something!
Mrs. Carson, what can I do?
- I'm helpless.
- Why, doc?
Isn't there something
we can do to help?
What do you think you could do here?
We got enough trouble without women of your kind.
Look, miss Carson.
- Don't take on like that.
Maybe Helga and I can help.
- Sure we'll help.
- Will you show us where we could shake down, please?
- All right.
- I take it real kind of you, Lacy.
- Thanks, Mrs. Carson.
I don't suppose...
Any of those fellows in Sacramento give a hang...
About these poor devils dyin' up here.
I know someone.
Tom Craig, a druggist.
Get a fast horse, ride like blazes and bring him back here.
- Where'll I get a horse?
- Use my horse. He's a whizzer.
Come on, let's go!
Tell him we need enough for an army!
Hurry up, Tom.
If I'd known all this was going on, I wouldn't have come to make the trip back with you.
You wouldn't want me to show my appreciation by leaving my stock in trade behind.
Boston, I'm so glad i caught you. They sent me.
Corral all the medicine you got, everything, and hurry up!
- What are you talking about?
- They want him up at the camps.
- There's fever, nothing to fight it with.
- Nothing to fight it with?
- There's only one doc, and he's working like mad.
- That's terrible.
- Are there many cases?
- All the camps have got it.
It's so bad at bear claw...
- That Lacy and Helga pitched in as nurses.
- Oh, that woman.
Come on, Ellen.
I don't think Lacy started an epidemic...
Just to see me.
She did send you, didn't she?
I suppose you could say she had a hand in it.
- It looks like I'll have to go.
- Why?
Why should you risk your life for a lot of riffraff?
They're people.
They need help.
Oh, you and your high ideals.
Where did they ever get you?
They're the very same people that turned against you.
They even tried to hang you.
- That doesn't enter into it.
- If it doesn't, it should.
Let's just forget the whole idea, Boston.
Don't go, kegs. Ellen--
I'm going back to San Francisco.
Are you coming with me?
I'm going to the gold camps first.
Then don't bother to come after me, if and when you come back.
[ Whistles ]
I saw the same look in a rattlesnake's eye once...
When I accidentally stomped on it.
Let's see how we're fixed for medicine.
What you got is a drop in the bucket. Doc says he wants enough for an army.
Then we'll get enough, and an army to take it.
Thanks for your cooperation, marshal.
It's easy to get the medicine, but I don't see how you're gonna get the people to walk into it.
You have the supplies ready,
I'll round up the people.
They wouldn't even stop to listen to Gabriel's horn, let alone you.
They'll have to... sometime.
[ Bell clanging ]
- Here, kegs. Keep that up.
- Huh? Oh.
[ Clanging continues ]
[ Clanging continues ]
Hold it, everybody!
- Quiet down! Don't panic.
- [ Excited chattering ]
I got a message for you.
I don't know whether to appeal to your good sense or your courage...
Because I don't know how much of either you have.
- What's that?
- What's he getting at?
I do know you're facing something that's gonna call for both:
Good sense and courage.
You think you're running away from the fever. Well, you aren't.
Some of you already have it, and
you're carrying it to others...
- Same as it was carried to you.
- Ain't that too bad!
What's he trying to say?
We ought to stay here and die like flies?
- [ Crowd mumbling ]
- no!
Word came from San Francisco that they're sending all the medical help we'll need.
They're also sending enough supplies and medicines for the gold camps.
And it's up to us
to get them there.
It's gonna take every wagon,
horse and able-bodied man
we have to get 'em through.
- Are you out of your head?
- You think we're crazy?
You askin' us to go into that death trap?
I'm not asking anything.
I'm telling you how things stand, then it's up to you.
You can stampede out of here like cattle and spread this fever...
Into every town in
California if you want to.
Or you can stay here
and get help if you're sick...
And give help
if you're not.
It's in your hands, so make up your minds.
Pioneers!
I've got two wagons
I'll donate. Somebody can drive the other one.
I'll drive the other one.
- I'll go with him. I ain't got no womenfolk to worry about.
- Me, neither.
I ain't seen a man yet can tell me I'm afraid and prove it.
- Me, neither.
- I reckon I'll go along.
[ Chattering ]
Dang if I don't think
I'm goin' with 'em.
I should've shot him off the wagon while I had the chance.
- I'm glad you didn't.
- When did you get religion?
- We're gonna need Craig around for a while.
- What for?
Get the wagon train started for the camp.
- Since when did you mind people dying?
- Use your head.
Those folks in the camps are rolling in gold.
If we corner all the medicine, we can swap it for every nugget they've dug in six months.
How do you figure to grab the wagons?
They have to go through digger pass. Don't they?
We'll be there waitin' for them.
I gotta hand it to you for being the meanest coyote this side of the rockies.
Thanks.
But remember, I claim the pleasure of pickin' off Craig personal.
Let's round up the rest of the gang.
Digger pass is half a day's ride.
Good. we ought to be at bear claw by nightfall.
Whip it up, boys.
We're on our last lap!
Come on, boys!
Once we're through the pass, the going's easy.
Them wagons are sure takin' a long time.
Clem, any sign of those wagons yet?
Not a sign of nothing expect pike.
Well, pike, my boy?
How are things at bear claw?
Are the folks ready to swap all their dust for medicine?
- It's awful bad.
- Fever's got most everybody down.
- Lacy's up there.
- Lacy?
Yeah. she and Helga's
got their hands full
taking care of sick folks.
- Lacy's up at bear claw.
- What of it?
She might get the fever.
Maybe she's got it already.
I've got to get to her.
- We've got a date with the wagon train.
- I've got to get Lacy out.
- We get the wagons first.
- You can take care of the wagons by yourself.
I ain't takin' those wagons alone while you go chasing around after Lacy.
Have you forgotten she threw you over for the first soft- talkin' dude that came along?
Why don't you get smart? She never had any use for you anyway.
Now maybe you'll stop yapping.
I'm gonna get Lacy and you're gonna take care of those wagons.
[ Gunshot ]
The wagons are coming!
From now on I'm giving the orders here.
When this job is finished, each man gets his equal share of the dust.
Any arguments? Then get on your horses and follow me.
[ Gunshots ]
We haven't got a chance here!
Make a run for it!
Let's go, men!
These teams can't keep up this pace. Pull over into that draw.
[ Gunshots continue ]
[ Gunshots continue ]
Craig, I want those wagons!
- Come and get 'em!
- It sounds like the Dawsons.
[ Gunshot ] it is the Dawsons.
Got 'im.
You have enough yet, Craig?
[ Gunshots continue ]
Our only chance is to get 'em out of those rocks.
Yes, if you want any drivers left.
- I guess I better go up there and have a chat with him.
- They'll fill you full of lead.
Hold your fire, Dawson!
- Boston, you're crazy!
- Let go of me.
That moss head.
What a target for a bull's-eye-- hold it. We need him to order the train to surrender.
I'm comin' to talk to you.
Chuck your gun away and come on up!
[ Chuckling ] keep him covered.
You walked right into it, eh, Craig?
- I have a proposition.
- We make the proposition.
You order that wagon train to surrender, or we shut your mouth up permanent.
- You've got five minutes to make up your mind.
- I can't understand you at all.
Most of you need what's in that wagon train as much as the people in the gold camps.
- Sure we do, to swap for the gold they got.
- Oh, so that's your plan.
From the looks of you, most of you won't get that far.
- Funny, you giving me five minutes.
- What kind of talk is this?
I know the signs of the fever.
Look at that man's hand shake.
Look at his eyes.
You fellas have been drinking that river water at the claim, haven't you?
That's where the fever comes from.
Out of all the people in the camps, what makes you think you'd escape it?
It isn't exactly a pleasant way
to die, burning with fever, all twisted up in agony and fighting for breath.
Frankly, I don't like the look of any of you.
Especially you, Dawson.
So if you're smart,
you'll call this gunfight off...
And let me try and save you with the stuff in the wagon train, if it's not too late.
We'll get all the medicine we want. Rush the wagons!
Talk yourself out of this one, Craig.
[ Gunshots ]
Joe had it comin' to him.
Get the wagons to bear claw.
[ Gunshots ]
Up the river to red dog.
You go on up to gospel creek.
Up the river to red dog.
Drive on up the river.
Am I glad to see you.
Besides drugs, did you bring food, blankets?
We brought everything.
Unload the wagons, men!
First two wagons go on
to shinbone creek!
Doc, there's a badly wounded man
in the first wagon.
Will you take a look at him?
- [ Doc ] sure.
- Tom!
Tom! thank heaven you're here.
Why, Lacy, you look so different.
Why, yes. These are my working clothes from now on.
I hope sending for you didn't get you into any trouble.
One the contrary.
It got me out of it.
Oh, brit Dawson was badly wounded.
- Brit?
- he wants to see you.
[ Groans ]
No, it's no good, doc.
I got it bad... and final.
Where's Lacy?
I lied to you.
I could've had you for a nurse.
Hold your hand.
Now I haven't got the strength.
Nobody go.
I got somethin' to say before witnesses.
The medicine that killed whitey?
I doctored it.
Boston is no way to blame.
Thanks, brit.
The house...
With the gold doorknobs?
If you want 'em--
♪ there's gold in the valley there's gold in the hills ♪
♪ there's gold in the river and gold in the rill ♪

What's the shootin' for, partner?
That's my wife taking down the washing.
[ Gunshots ] oh! Oh-- okay, coming, dear. Coming, dear.
I'm not gonna do all that washing over again!
McKeever, pick it up!

Jeb?
Jeb, where are you?
Oh!
Are you all right?
I'm all right.
I brought you some things... some meal and beans and a good canteen.
Is that what kept you- getting those things?
I came as soon as I could.
I brought you a map too.
Look.
If you work up north through the gloriettas, you can hit the skin road.
If I work north?
What about you? Yes, Jeb.
Where will you be?
I'm not going with you.
I knew it as soon as you came in...
By the look on your face and the way you walked.
You've always been like that-
Able to think with my thoughts and feel with my feelings.
But there's something that keeps us apart.
Oh, Jeb, what happened to us?
Why did everything go wrong?
I don't know all of it, but I know some.
I've been thinking and figuring.
This is where it started, this is where it's going to end.
You see that rise?
He'll be coming over that.
He'll come killing.
Come out, or we'll come in after ya!
You hear it?
Jeb, honey, there's no one out there.
You're imagining.
I'm not imagining.
Remembering.
Putting together what happened- what I guess must've happened.
Thor, it's all coming back, strong and clear.
There's an answer in it.
There's something about me that explains everything.
Jeb, I don't understand. I'm gonna make you understand.
I've got to before they get here.
Do you know why
I came to this place?
No, Jeb, but...
It's not a good hideout.
They're sure to trail you here.
I came for another reason.
I was here before, long ago.
I was a baby then.
I was scared the way only a kid can get.
I was in a dark, cold place.
I had my eyes closed to get away from some bad dream-
The same dream
I'd been having all my life.
I've never understood it. There were boots running, flashes.
Daddy? Daddy? but my father wasn't there.
Instead, a strange woman was lying on the floor.
She crawled toward me.
That was the first time
I saw your mother.
Get up, son. No, Jeb, you can't go to sleep now.
Get your clothes on, son. We're going away from here. Who is that?
That's Jeb Rand. Now, pay attention, Adam... And thor.
This is Jeb.
He's going to live with us.
Come on, now.
Help your sister.
They've gone, every danged one of 'em.
They've moved away somewhere.
Grant, if you ride with that arm, you'll lose it.
I'll find 'em if it takes me to the end of my life.
The idea that I was hiding or running away never quite died out.
It should have, I guess, because the next seven years I wasn't hiding.
Your ma was taking care of all of us.
I was growing up with you and Adam,
Going to school, helping to build a house in the new place we moved to,
Having the whole outdoors for a playground.
I'd about stopped having nightmares until one day when I was about nine or ten-
Look, Jeb!
A little black chick.
I found him under the house.
- What's the matter with you? - You know what's the matter! You shot the colt!
Shot what colt?
Are you crazy?
Mom!
Jeb, stop!
Stop!
Mom! Mom, they're fighting again! Mom!
Now, stop that fighting, boys!
Stop that fighting!
Now, stop it!
Stop that fighting, boys!
Thor, pump some water.
Now, stop it! Come on, boys!
Now, stop that fighting!
Come on!
Stop it!
Adam! Jeb!
Now, what's it all about?
He shot the colt.
I didn't!
You did so! You mean somebody shot our colt?
Said it was his.
He said I couldn't ride it.
But I rode it anyway.
He took a shot at it.
Or maybe me.
I don't know.
But anyway, he killed the colt.
No. Somebody may have killed him, but it wasn't Adam.
He's been here all morning greasing the buckboard.
You say somebody took a shot at you? Who could it have been, ma?
Well, I don't rightly know.
Matter of fact, there were some deer hunters hanging around.
Yes, sir. They asked me if they could hunt down our fence,
And I told 'em yes.
You go and get your supper off the stove, and no more fightin'.
You gonna see those men, ma?
That's right.
Put that wheel back on.
So, you found us.
You covered up your trail pretty well.
As soon as the boy told me somebody tried to kill him,
I knew it was you.
Being a lawyer hasn't done your shootin' any good, grant.
Yeah. Maybe losin' this some years ago didn't help any either.
You owe me for a colt.
Doggone critter was too lively.
When he crawled off, he spoiled my aim.
You can't start it all over again, grant. I won't let you.
You're gettin' kind of uppity, ain't you?
He's a Rand. I knew it the first minute I laid eyes on him.
He brought to mind that you was married to my brother.
And a score still isn't settled for his death.
You lost a brother,
I lost a husband.
I don't want any more vengeance for him.
I never figured that you would.
That's why I swore that
I'd kill every Rand on earth.
And he's the only one left.
How in tarnations you get him?
Let's say the lord gave him to me.
Let the boy alone, grant.
He's innocent.
That night ended it for him.
A night like that don't have an end.
What happened to him there will make him do things just-
Just like spirits were whispering in his ear saying,
"kill, kill.
You've got to kill."
Spirits may talk to you, but they won't to him. I don't believe in your spirits.
Maybe not, but someday you'll wish
I hadn't missed my shot today...
Down on the draw. That's one day that'll never come.
He's a good boy.
I love him like my own son.
What makes you think that boy loves you?
Well... I'll go back to santa fe.
I swear I think I'll leave that
Rand alone, let him grow up,
Just to see what happens to you when he's big enough to start asking questions.
Don't forget your money for the colt.
Thanks for reminding me.
This'll help me bring him up.
Did you find 'em, ma?
Did you talk to 'em?
Why, sure I did. It was them deer hunters all right.
They shot the colt.
Put the team up, Adam, and feed 'em. You help him, thor.
Come in the house with me, son. I want to talk to you.
Jeb, how much do you remember...
About coming to live with us-
About the night
I brought you here?
You must remember something. Not much.
You can tell me, Jeb.
I get mixed up when I think about that.
I remember flashes...
And boots runnin'.
You know your parents are dead. That's why I took you in.
Yes, ma'am.
But you don't remember them?
No, ma'am.
Sometimes I try to think about it. I don't know.
My head hurts.
It gets all blurred.
Sometimes the lord protects us...
By letting us know only what's needful.
What you don't remember doesn't matter.
You belong here with us now.
Don't ask questions of the past.
It has no answers for you.
Grow up strong in the love that's here for you.
As long as you love in return, nothing can happen.
And you do love us, don't you, Jeb?
I'm sorry
I started the fight.
Well, son,
After today you boys won't have anything to fight about.
Adam, thor, come here.
Now, pay heed to me, you children.
I'll have no more arguments as to who owns what on this ranch,
Colts or anything else.
Everything we have or ever will have...
Belongs to you three from this day on.
You mean, everything has to be that way? Yes, Adam.
Have you any objection to that?
Not for thor and me, but I have for outsiders.
There are no outsiders here.
You three are together.
You yourselves...
Are the best and finest thing there is- a family.
You promise not to forget that?
I mean all three of you.
All right.
Thor, stop scratching.
Go in the house and get some coal oil, put it on those chiggers.
Adam, you find the sheep scissors.
I'm gonna cut yours and Jeb's hair tonight.
Jeb, we've always called you by your right name- Rand.
Would you like to use our name instead?
If you don't mind, I'd like to use my own name... Jeb Rand.
All right, Jeb.
You know how it was after that.
Ma's idea worked like she wanted it, pretty near.
Anyhow, we seemed more like a family.
We were close, the four of us.
That lasted for a long time.
It lasted until that day
I rode into town. detail, halt!
Right face!
About face!
Order arms!
Hey, what's all the shoutin' and drum beatin' about? Ain't you heard?
The territory's fightin' Spain, and it looks like we're gonna have a real shootin' war too.
Hi, Jeb.
Good morning, doctor.
Hello, Prentice. That's quite some excitement you've got around here.
Sure is.
Gotta beat them spaniards.
Sure wish I could fight, but dad won't let me.
Meanin' I won't lie about his age so he can join.
I fought in one war. He don't know what he's stayin' out of.
Here's your mail, Jeb.
Thanks, bam.
That dress and petticoat thorl sent for came in.
Hope it's what she wanted.
I've been keeping it for her.
She'll be obliged to you.
I'll tell her I saw you.
How's my credit, bam?
I need some tobacco.
Never heard anything wrong with the credit on the Callum ranch.
Thanks.
Mr. Rand?
Yes.
I heard him mention the Callum ranch.
I'm, uh, state provost, down here to supervise recruiting.
Every outfit around about here is sending in a quota.
One man apiece to fight the spaniards.
I was sort of interested to see if anyone was coming in from your ranch.
Oh, I guess this is what you mean, sir. It came a little late.
Some of the outfits are sending in every danged rider they've got.
Except the aged and unfit.
We'll let you know tomorrow which one it's gonna be...me or my brother Adam.
Is that soon enough?
I guess so,
Unless you'd like the pleasure of riding home tonight...
And telling the folks you've just joined up.
Fill this out and sign it and hand it in when you report.
If I'm the one that reports.
If not, Adam will have to do it.
Give me two. The provost seems bound and determined...
To get you into this war.
It sort of appeared that way to me too.
Who is that fella anyway?
What's his name? heck, I figured you knew him.
Ain't he some kind of kin of yours? No kin of mine.
I have no kin. His name's
Callum, just the same.
There's a whole slew of 'em up north.
halt! Order arms!

The recruits are ready to be sworn in. Is that right, boys?
All right.
Raise your right hands.
Repeat after me. I, a citizen of the United States, do solemnly swear-
"I, a citizen of the United
States, do solemnly swear...
That I will bear true faith and allegiance to the United States of America.
That I will bear true faith and allegiance to the United States of America."
- Is that package for me?
- Yes.
The dry goods you ordered.
Oh, good.
Maybe it's my dress.
Hey, Adam?
Hello? When you finish up there, come on in the house.
I got some business to talk over with you. All right.
What is it?
"... As a soldier in the volunteer army of the...
"United States of America for a period of two years, unless sooner discharged
The first company's leaving in the morning.
I told him we'd let him know by then. It's not fair.
Why can't they get soldiers from the big ranches, where there have plenty of riders?
Can't be helped, sis. Them spaniards has to be beat.
I won't let either of you go. I'll ride into town and explain we need both of you here.
You can only keep one of us at home, sis.
But you can help pick which one it's gonna be. That's a job I don't want.
Should we tell ma, or decide without her?
Decide for ourselves,
I say.
Tell her after.
Well, ad, what do you say?
How are we gonna settle it?
I'm agreeable to anything you suggest.
All right, I'll draw numbers with you, run you a race or cut cards.
That would be your way of deciding it.
This isn't a game. It's serious. I'm serious.
How about a toss? That's the quickest. That's fine with me.
Then let me toss it.
Flip it high.
If it's tails, ad goes.
Heads, it's Jeb.
It's heads.
Jeb, you're the one.
It was a fair toss.
So be it.
Well, there's no use stalling around any longer.
Adam, will you cut out a horse for me? Sure.
I'll get going tonight. I better go to ma now and tell her.
Don't let anything happen to you, Jeb.
I couldn't stand that. If anything happened to you-
Nothing's gonna happen, ma.
I'll come back.
Why, sure,
I know you will.
One of you had to go.
Perhaps it's best this way.
Good-bye, Jeb.
Good-bye, ma.
Good-bye, Jeb.
So long.
Come home, Jeb.
Until I do, maybe you'd like this for a keepsake.
I guess it sort of slipped out of your hand.
Right through the window too.
It didn't slip.
I threw it.
I don't blame you. You wanted to keep
Adam here, so you lied about the toss.
I wanted to lie, but I didn't.
If I had, it would've been to keep you here,
Not Adam.
You felt that way too?
The same way I felt.
I was supposed to be your sister.
That's how it's been ever since we were kids.
Only I stopped being your sister,
And you've never been my brother.
But I had to go on every day pretending,
Watching you all day, letting you touch me,
And at night going in my room,
Lying there, thinking about you.
I wish I had lied.
I wish I had cheated about the toss and kept you here.
Wait for me.
You know I will.
I'll leave him at the ace high livery stable. Pick him up in the morning.
So long. Give them spaniards heck for me. I'll do that.
Come on!

Feel any better?
I feel all right. Well, I don't know whether you were lucky or not.
You were sure dreaming something.
I've heard a lot of fever chatter in my time.
Don't bother with it much when it's concerned with war, but yours was different.
Seemed to come from way back somewhere when you were a kid.
- What'd I say? - Something about boots and flashes of light.
Somebody hurt or killed.
Does that mean anything to you? I don't know.
But you gotta tell me what I said, doc. Every word. I wanna know.
Don't upset yourself.
Your fever's gone,
And the nightmare is with it wherever they came from.
That leg is gonna get you home.
Home?
The stage is in!
No, no. The provost wants to pay for it.
Oh, thank you, sir, for the treat.
It's a pleasure to treat a man who takes so little interest in today's occasion.
See, personally, I too have small interests in a doggone hero.
We think a great deal of Jeb out at the ranch.
Too bad they don't have a brass band for a good cattle tally.
Understand you've been doing a fine job out there.
I don't believe
I know your name, sir.
It's the same as yours
- Callum. I'm the prosecutor at santa fe.
We're kin, you know. Then I'm glad to make your acquaintance. listen to that.
The ladies deprecate killing, but my, how they admire a war hero.
Jeb, you know, comes by his instincts naturally.
He inherited them.
Is that so?
I don't believe I ever talked to anyone who knew Jeb Rand's kinfolk.
Sometime, take a little ride for yourself up into glorietta township...
And see what the records have to say about a family named Rand.
Good luck.
"for this meritorious and exceptional action,
"I now award you the medal of honor...
Of the United States of America."
Good to see you, ma. My, you're looking fine.
Hello, thor.
Hello, Jeb.
Welcome home, Jeb.
Thank you, Adam.
Glad to be home. Come on. Ride up here with me. Let's get on out to the ranch.
Once you're sleepin' in your own bed and eatin' at your own table, Jeb,
Maybe you'll forget all about the killin' and shootin' the general talked so much about.
Don't have to forget it, ma.
Never think about it.
Giddap!
I was savin' this for thanksgiving.
I guess we're havin' a kind of thanksgiving anyway.
Thank you. Welcome to my son, Jeb.
Thank you, ma.
To you, Jeb, and you must drink to me.
It would be fittin' to have some music.
Remember, boys?
"the londonderry air."
Why, you used to sing it. once more, I'll awaken the sweetness of thy slumbering strain in tears our last farewell was taken and now in tears we meet again yet, even then while peace was singing her halcyon song o'er land and sea though joy and hope to others bring ye she only brought new tears to thee
Yes, Jeb, you'll find changes, and good ones too.
We got four new sections of the richest fillery you ever saw.
I guess any kind of cattle talk's boresome after you've been away from it for a while.
Like a fellow said to me today:
"they don't play brass bands for cattlemen."
Speaking of cattle, Jeb, you're entitled to read this tally.
You'll find all the operations in here written down, clear and legal.
I don't have to read, ad.
I can trust your tally.
Well, it's there for you to see.
I've got your share all marked off.
I call it the Rand share.
Sit down, ad. Won't you have some more coffee?
No, thanks.
Well, it's been a big day. One day's the same as another to me.
I gotta be in the saddle at sunup.
Good night, ma.
Good night, son.
Good night.
Good night, Adam.
I'll finish up. You go along. No, you-
Well, all right.
I'm all tuckered out.
Good night, Jeb.
Good night, ma.
All these trips to town tire me out.
Jeb?
You know somethin'?
What?
There's a moon out.
Wait till
I get my shawl.
Jeb?
Jeb, sweetheart, is something wrong?
Thor, we ought to go away.
We will.
I mean right now, tonight.
Let's hitch up a horse and not tell anyone.
We'll wake up a preacher over in town and make him marry us.
You know I'll marry you.
What are we waiting for?
I want you to come court me.
I know that seems silly when we grew up together, but...
I want to pretend we didn't.
That's why you've got to come sparkin' me.
Do you mind? You can get dressed up real fashionable.
So will I. I'll have two chairs out in the gallery.
I'll bring out some lemonade.
We'll sit there and talk.
You can ask me if I'll let you smoke, and I'll say yes.
I'll have a piece of sewing.
What'll we talk about?
Oh, sort of parlor talk.
The words will be like stitches that sew and pull on our lives together.
After a while, you can hold my hand.
You're not supposed to kiss me till you bought a ring.
Oh, Jeb, can you understand?
Can you see it in my way?
Thor, I've never belonged here.
I don't know why. I always have a feeling something's after me.
It's a bad feeling
I can't explain.
Lots of times I'm happy, but it's still there.
Thor, I've gotta be with you.
We've got to have a chance. Let's get away before something happens.
Please, sweetheart.
We're gonna get married,
Jeb.
We're not gonna spend the rest of our lives doing crazy things...
Because you think something's gonna happen.
We're not gonna run away at night like a couple of stagecoach robbers.
I love you, Jeb.
But if we're gonna get married, can't it be the way I say?
Please, sweetheart?
I only hope it turns out that way. after that, I had to be alone and think things out.
We hadn't really quarreled, and yet somehow we had.
It seemed as if we couldn't understand each other anymore.
One day, I rode up into butte country.
Came straight to this place, just as if I'd known the way.
There was something in my life as ruined as that house.
That house was myself.
I'd seen it a million times before-
The fireplace,
The trap door.
Out back, there was some cattle bones.
And then as I walked around the side, I came on some unmarked graves.
All of the sudden,
I couldn't breathe.
If that house was me, what part of me was buried in those graves?
Some folks has me beat.
When there's work to be done,
That's the time they decide to go ridin' all over the countryside.
Honey, I was worried about you.
We didn't know where you were.
I'm sorry.
I just took a little ride.
How long since you've had something to eat?
I don't know, but I'm not hungry. I'll fix you some coffee.
That'll be fine.
Right now I wanna see ma.
You got no more sense than a duck.
Well, I had sense enough to come home.
Why, thor was fit to be tied worrying over you.
I was sort of worried myself.
I got halfway lost. I strayed away up in that rimrock country,
Up bear paw butte way.
Bear paw butte? Now, what crazy thing made you do that?
You and thor have a nip up?
Thor had nothing to do with my going.
I wanna ask you something, ma.
I've been wondering about that old ranch up there. a goat couldn't live in that range.
A burro would starve.
People lived there once though.
You know the ranch
I mean?
I just remembered.
Seems to me there was...
Someplace up there long ago.
Seems to me
I've been there before.
Ma Callum, does that ranch have to do with me?
Don't ask me questions,
Jeb.
Did I come from there as a boy?
Is that where you took me from all those years ago?
Is that why
I remember it?
I told you not to look backward. Look ahead.
I obeyed you.
I've lived like you said.
All my life, I've known
I didn't really belong here.
I couldn't love. I couldn't return your kindness.
Is there something the matter with me?
I wanna understand, ma.
You've gotta tell me.
There's nothing the matter with you, Jeb.
That ranch might mean more to me than it does to you.
Anyway, I get upset talking about it.
A person's gotta find his own answers.
We're alone, each of us, and each in a different way.
I won't be alone.
I'm gonna marry thor.
I want you to.
But when you do, you've got the future to live for.
I've got the past to live with too.
My children will have to live with it. Stop vexing me, Jeb bRand.
I'm giving you my daughter for your wife.
Isn't that enough for you? Doesn't that show you that you're loved?
Go away from me with your doubts and your-
Your bear paw butte and your crazy long rides.
Leave off vexing me.
You told me once not to question you,
But the questions keep coming back.
If you won't answer me, I'll have to look somewhere else for the answer.
Goin' out, Jeb?
Thought I'd go and see if mr. Dingle's faro game is still as crooked as ever.
Good idea.
What'd you say?
I said it was a good idea.
How'd you like to take two or three thousand dollars along, stake you in the game?
Maybe one of us is crazy, but I don't seem to follow you.
The tally book would've made it kind of simple if you'd taken the trouble to read it.
That's why I gave it to you when you came home.
Only now, I got this year's crop added.
Two or three thousand would be no more than your share of the profits.
A third to each of us,
The way ma wants it.
That's mighty generous. More than
I deserve, least ways expected.
Thanks. Here's something else you don't know.
All the time you were in the army, we've been banking money for you.
Fifteen hundred dollars. There's just one thing wrong with it, Jeb.
That money came out of the ranch, and you didn't earn it.
I've been workin' my share and yours too.
I don't aim to keep on doin' that.
I never asked you to. No, but you never tried to help me either.
Your foot's been well for a month, and you've been drawin' that money...
For lyin' in the shade.
I was lucky if I didn't have six of my riders stretched out alongside you playin' pitch.
Oh, sure, I know you were a hero once,
But I've had my belly full of that too.
We don't pay off in medals around here.
It was too bad
I came home at all.
If I hadn't, you would've had the ranch and the tally money...
And my share of everything all to yourself.
This "share and share alike" doesn't sit any better with me than it does with you.
I'm thinkin' the same way you are.
This ranch isn't big enough to hold the two of us.
There's a way we can settle that.
Jeb, you promised me there'd be no trouble.
I wanna hear what he has to say.
How can we settle it?
I'll buy you out.
Suppose I don't wanna sell?
Then you buy me out.
Now, you know I can't do that. Adam, please.
Jeb, don't say anything more.
Won't you do that much for me?
Thor, you keep out of this.
Well, what's your notion, if you don't like mine?
When I went to war, we settled with a toss.
I kept this.
Maybe if it suits you, we can spin it again.
There might be some luck in it for me this time.
I'll toss you. My share against yours. One of us stays, and one goes.
Oh, you can't!
You either!
It's wrong and crazy.
Ever since we were little, we've all been here together
- the three of us.
This is no way to change it if it's going to be changed.
One toss.
You wanna spin it?
Adam, I beg you!
And you, Jeb, don't do it!
Winner take all.
One toss.
Call it.
Heads.
I might've known that cartwheel was bad luck.
Well, I'll be ridin' in town.
I'll hire a rig tomorrow and come back for my things.
No, you won't.
You ain't got no things,
Exceptin' what you're wearin'...
And this!
Tomorrow I'm coming back,
And you're coming with me.
If he tries to stop me,
I'll kill him. ma'll never let you do this.
Maybe she'll have to.
Then I'll go with him in the morning.
When he comes, I'll be ready. You'd never.
Not if it meant leavin' the ranch.
The ranch isn't everything to me. It isn't a husband.
"the ranch be a husband." you're talkin' crazy.
It's been a wife to you, Adam,
Because you don't have a wife.
You just have the ranch.
Well, I don't belong to it.
You can take me off that dogeared tally book you carry around.
You hate me then?
I love you.
I always thought the three of us would never be apart.
Three. Three!
You're always sayin' that!
But why does he count?
It's you and me.
Now you're the one that's talkin' crazy. I want a home of my own.
Grant Callum knew him.
Knew his people too.
Told me to look up the records in glorietta county.
And did you? Sure I did, and I found something.
A family named Rand did live there once.
I found out enough for me-
A reason why I'll never let you marry him.
I don't care what your reason is.
You're talkin' like a back-fence gossip.
Do you think that kind of talk means anything to me?
Nothing in the world can change the way I feel.
I always knew you cared for him.
I guess...
I never knew how much.
Looks as if we're gonna have to set things right.
You'll- you'll go after him, then?
You'll ride in town and bring him back?
I'll do it.
I'll ride in town tonight.

Mr. Dingle, can you take this man's I. O. U.?
Yes, I'll take it.
Now throw him out.
Yes.
Keep your hands off me, will ya?
What's the matter, Jake? Don't you take money in here anymore?
Any money you put on this bar is counterfeit.
I'm saving you for the wheel.
Did you run into a fellow who nearly convinced you? Well, he tried.
You know, I flipped this dollar twice with Adam. I lost both times.
Last time, I went to war.
This time, I left the ranch.
You left the ranch?
You mean that?
Maybe you've played into a cold deck.
Well, I guess it's all for the best. Oh, sure.
A man's luck's bound to change sometime. You appear lucky to me.
Don't you want some action for this dollar? It's kind of a keepsake.
Oh. Well, many a man's been down to his last dollar...
Before the change does come.
I guess you just want this dollar.
All right, go ahead and take it.
Hey, Jeb, you won.
Let it ride. Oh, no. Too many angles at this game.
I'd rather play poker.
You've had a run of good luck,
Jeb. Why don't you pull out?
Oh, once more.
Oh, brother.
Luck's sure riding on your shoulder.
Probably clean this place out.
Oh, I've got a feeling you're through.
Well, I've got about $1,500 here that says you've got a wrong feeling.
Joe, get me a new deck.
Well...
There it is.
I'll tell you what I'd do with that money if I were you. Don't tell me. Let me guess.
I'd buy into this business.
I'll sell you a piece of it.
You don't mean that?
Yes, I do.
You know why?
Why?
Well, because people trust you...
And, well,
I'm just honest Jake dingle.
You know, I might take you up on that.
I'll be looking for a business by and by.
Well, you think it over and let me know.
We'd make a great combination, you and myself.
And if you do come in, I'll teach you how to handle cards.
It don't hurt anything.
Good night.
Good night, partner.
And take good care of that money. as I walked out on the streets of laredo
I walked out on laredo one day
I spied a cow puncher wrapped up in white linen wrapped in white linen as cold as the clay beat the drum slowly and play the fife lowly play the dead March as you carry me along take me out to the prairie and lay the sod over me for I'm a poor cowboy and I know I've done wrong and lay the sod over me
Adam.
Now, let us continue.
I disagree with the learned corner. I still maintain...
We're a legal body, properly impaneled.
Sit down, grant.
This is my hearin'.
I don't need no county prosecutor to tell me how to run it.
Furthermore, since it so happens...
Said prosecutor's name is Callum,
I wouldn't want to say he's prejudiced
'cause I'm clean-minded, I am.
It's my duty to see the law administered...
Regardless of family or anything else.
Gentlemen, I swear from the bottom of my heart...
I never felt more like quitting my job than right now.
Because I well know what this case may cost a family-
A sorrowing mother and sister-
Who have already lost one son, one brother...
And, if my guess is right, may lose another to the law.
Miss Callum,
On the night in question,
Did you witness a quarrel between your brother and Jeb Rand?
Yes, I did.
And did you hear the accused utter any threat with regard to Adam?
Yes.
You may repeat what you heard.
Jeb said he was comin' back next day to get me...
To take me with him and marry me.
He said if Adam tried to stop him, he'd kill him.
Perhaps you fellers might like a spot of tea. now, here's the size of it.
Here's two men that had no use want for each other.
All that's been testified, but that ain't what we're here to decide.
It looks like Jeb shot him down like grant said.
Hold your horses. It's grant's word against Jeb's, he way I see it.
Jeb never was no murderer. I figure there's plenty of doubt on both sides.
The heck you say. Nobody can get along with ad Callum.
Let's get somethin' done. I gotta get home and look after my stall.
Shut up!
You fellows saw the general pin a medal on Jeb.
Ah, he weren't decoratin' no ambusher...
But a man that fought fair and square for his country.
It don't stand to reason that a man that shot down a dozen fellows in battle...
Would shoot down his own brother without givin' him a chance.
If he had to drill him, he'd do it right.
Uh-uh-uh! And if he done it right, then it ain't no killin',
But a lawful fight.
And hereabouts we ain't so danged uncivilized...
A man can't win a lawful fight without gettin' his neck in a noose for it.
Pass the tea.
Thank you.
May I speak to you before you go, mrs. Callum?
I know you don't hold with the verdict of the jury, but it was fair.
I never murdered Adam.
You'll be shorthanded at the ranch.
If you'll permit me, I'd be happy to come back and help you out.
I make this offer most sincerely.
Get away from me,
Jeb Rand.
I know how you must feel about me,
But I was hoping that in time I could change that.
It's too late to change anything.
Mother, let's go.
No. I'll have my say.
You may have cleared yourself in there,
But not with me.
With me you're walkin' up the gallows steps.
I built that gallows.
I tied the noose.
All the love I had for you is dead.
Stay out of my sight.
If you cross my section line,
I'll set the dogs on you.
Is that the way you feel? you'd made pretty clear how you felt,
So that fall
I put in with Jake.
I found out how dull gambling could be when I stood on the other side of the table.
Once or twice we got some news about you
- come on, baby!
How you'd been sick,
How you were living out at the ranch and not seeing anyone.
I watched for you to come into town, but you never did.
It was fall again before I heard young Prentice, the storekeeper's son,
Was taking you and your mother to the dance. do-si your daughters and do-si your old men do-si your brothers to the ball and do-si back home allemande left and the old left hand meet your partner and promenade it's on fire and I don't care and park your gal in an easy chair
Would you like a glass of punch? I'd love it.
Excuse me a minute.
Thanks. and now, ladies and gentlemen, the next will be la varsouviana.
May I have the pleasure?
Please go away.
Better dance, or people will look at you.
I'd rather have people look at me than dance with somebody I hate.
What a coward you are.
A coward wouldn't have come here to dance with you. hold it. All right, folks, that's enough of our slow dance.
Here's a chance to swing your ladies,
So get your partners for a chicken reel.
Uh... You saw thor dancin' with Jeb, didn't you?
Why, yes. Come on, son. Let's you and I have a little talk.
Now, you forced her. Jeb Rand, the man she hates most in the world,
Forced her to dance with him.
I was getting her some punch.
You're escorting her this evening, aren't you? Yes.
Did you bring her here so she could be insulted? No. I wouldn't let that happen.
Well, it's happened.
What are you gonna do about it?
Pardon us, gentlemen.
Mr. Callum, all this started long ago.
It isn't my fight. Then you're not the man I took you for.
I'll do what's right.
If you let him get away with it, she'll never speak to you again.
Did she say that? If she didn't, she's thinking it.
And there's something else she's thinking of.
It's the death of her brother.
Mr. Callum, sir...
I'm not much good with a gun.
Maybe you'll have some help.
Go up to the alley.
If he's an honest wheel, you'll find him in the back room.
Shoot him through the window.
No, sir, I-
I can't do that.
But I'll make him come out to me.
What's the matter, Jake?
Couldn't you find any partner?
You found one you shouldn't have- thor.
Young Prentice is comin' over after you for it. Prentice?
He's on his way over here now. Get the drop on him, Jeb. Go on out front.
First Adam, now Prentice.
Man, you gotta get going.
I don't wanna get the drop on him, Jake.
What are you gonna do?
Step out in the alley and make myself scarce.
Mr. Rand.
What do you want?
I've come because of what you did to thorley.
Go on home, Prentice.
I don't want to hurt you.
Defend yourself, mr. Rand.
I wouldn't try that if I were you, grant.
Let's get him in the office.
I- I did it for thorley.
I'm sorry, Prentice. it was self-defense just as they said,
Yet he was one more part of the mystery of people hating me.
How I saw the boots of the pallbearers,
The flashes of light.
I had that feeling some lost and awful thing come over me again.
I wasn't sure whether killing
Prentice was my fault,
Whether it was due to some badness locked up in me.
But I was sure of my love for you.
That was the only hope and the only answer.
If love could come out of all this, we might still have some chance.
We might live.
Right then I knew
I had to have you.
I'd have to climb across two graves to get to you,
But nothing in the world could hold me back.
Who's that comin'?
It's Jeb Rand.
He's comin' to call on me.
Jeb Rand?
Callin' on you?
I knew he'd come.
I've been expectin' him.
You've no right to expect him, much less to see him.
I'm askin' him in.
Sorry to have kept you waiting.
Won't you come in?
Thank you.
It was kind of you to receive me.
Please sit down.
Thank you.
Would you like some coffee?
I don't want to put you to any trouble.
Oh, it's no trouble.
We were just going to have some.
I'm sorry we have nothing else to offer.
In this house all we have is a little wine.
That's just for christmas and holidays.
Seems to me I remember something about that wine.
That's a music box ma had sent from santa fe.
I know. It plays
"the londonderry air."
It's an old-fashioned tune.
Some people don't care for it.
May I smoke?
Or would that annoy you?
No, of course not.
This is a sampler I'm makin'.
I'm not very good at it.
Here we are courting, the way you asked me to long ago.
But it's all different.
You sitting there.
Me smoking, you sewing.
Just like any ordinary people.
It's worse than fighting or yelling in the street.
- Don't you want your coffee?
- No, thanks.
Perhaps later. Why don't you sit down in the comfortable chair?
Company always uses that one.
I tried to figure out what crazy game you were playing with me,
And I couldn't.
But I knew I'd play it out with you right till the end.
Am I seeing things?
Well, I declare!
Good night, Jeb
I'll see you tomorrow?
Of course.
Thor.
Thor! Come here!
- What is it?
- Come closer.
Turn the lamp up.
That's right.
I want to look at you.
I haven't changed, mother.
What have I taught you that showed you how to bring dishonor on us?
I've brought you no dishonor.
Jeb gave me this tonight.
I'm going to marry him, mother.
What's in this that I don't understand? Do you love him then?
I have only one thought every minute of my life:
How much I hate him.
But you wear his ring.
If I were a man,
I would've killed him long ago.
After Adam's death.
Then he killed Prentice and came courtin' me.
All of a sudden, killin' wasn't enough.
I had to have more-
Much more- to use up all the hate I have in me.
Thor, I'll sell this place.
I'll go away.
I won't stay here and see this thing happen.
Perhaps that may be best.
You go away for a while.
We'll be together again soon.
No woman ever lived...
Who could go through with what you're planning.
No woman but me.
'cause it's taken all my life to teach me what he is.
He put shame and grief on us,
And now he'd like to squeeze out the last drop of it by havin' me.
He wants me...
And I'll marry him.
That moment when he thinks he has me, he'll lose everything...
Because that's when
I'm going to kill him.
For richer, for poorer.
For richer, for poorer.
In sickness and in health.
In sickness and in health.
Until death do us part.
Until death do us part.
What made you do that?
I don't know. Such fine young folks, and nobody at the wedding.
I have a surprise for you.
I've bought you a house.
All right, charlie.
Well, now you've seen it.
That's why I sent for you.
Bein' as we're all Callums here, I don't have to tell you what we're gonna do about it.
Sure enough, you'll get yourself in trouble, and us too.
Yeah. Times have changed since all this started, grant.
You can't ride herd on the law no more.
You're telling me about the law? No, sir.
You thinkin' like him, that you're not goin'? That's right.
I think we're all goin'.
When I heard about the auction,
I figured it'd be better for me to buy it than see it pass on to strangers.
Allow me. I know it's a custom to carry the bride in,
But perhaps we can let that go.
I always figured when I got married I'd have all the trimmings.
You may notice some changes. There are some fixings I brought here from kansas city.
Mighty pretty place you've got here.
Charlie, would you take mrs. Rand's bags into the front bedroom, please?
I sure will.
Come in.
You're very beautiful.
Thank you.
I hope you'll be comfortable here.
In this house it takes very little to make me comfortable.
I brought you some wine.
It's customary, I believe, to drink to a bride's health.
You're very gallant.
So you know.
You and I are much alike.
There are times when
I can read your thoughts...
By asking myself what I'd do if I were in your place.
I know that's an irritating quality in a husband,
But it may help to make things easier for you.
Don't come any closer.
You sure this is all right?
Prentice missed because the light was bad.
Adam was too anxious.
I'm glad you don't suffer from those handicaps.
No, I don't.
Do you know why you missed me?
Because I hate you so, my hand shook.
Your hand shook, but not because you hate me.
Put the gun down, thor.
Oh, Jeb. Hold me.
Hold me.
Jeb? What is it?
What's the matter?
I've gotta leave. There are men outside. They want to kill me.
It's all grant Callum's doing.
I don't know why, but he's wanted me dead ever since I can remember.
Oh, take me with you. I can't, but we can be together in a little while.
There's an old ruined ranch up by bear paw butte. Meet me there.
How do I find it? Take the trail through rimrock canyon, across the county line.
Oh, I'll be there.
Looks like he jumped clean off this bluff here. Aw, he just outrun us.
Let's give it up. I got a hunch I know where he is.
Russ, go fetch ma Callum and bring her to bear paw butte.
It's all going to happen again, but I don't care now.
I know there's one big answer
I've always looked for:
Why I was alone; why everything went wrong;
Why I had hate in me instead of love.
There was a black dog riding my back and yours too.
I guess we've lost our chance, but there's nothing we can do about it now.
Oh, but there is. We've got to get away from here, both of us.
Jeb Rand, we know you're in there. Come on out!
We'll give you two minutes!
Are you hurt?
I remember now. Those dreams I've been having ever since I was a kid. the flashes were gunfire,
And the man shooting was my father.
My sister lay on the floor dead, and my brothers were dead too.
The boots and spurs, they were my father's.
Then he was hit.
I saw him fall.
I knew he'd been killed.
I was too scared to yell, so I just stayed there.
Then a man came in- grant Callum.
He was dragging a woman with him. She was your mother.
He told her to look at her Rand now.
I remember those words-
"your Rand."
He asked her if the love she had for him was worth what she'd done.
Then he threw her down and dragged my father out.
Jeb, darling, how horrible.
It must mean that my mother-
One minute! Come out, or we'll come and drag you out!
Come on.
I won't.
You're doing this for me because you're afraid I'll be hurt.
I don't want to live without you. We've gotta fight. we're comin' out.
Don't shoot.
Throw your gun out!
Put your hands up.
Oh! Oh, I told him to fight you, to die fightin' if he had to!
Let me go!
Oh, mother, you won't let them do this!
So, grant, you're gonna have it your way at last.
I told you I'd wait until he was grown.
Well, now he's growed and he gets his legacy. Only it's made out of him.
He earned it just as his father earned the lead he got...
When he stole my brother's wife.
Then it was Jeb's father!
You loved him.
Yes, only she forgot she was married to a Callum.
Bring a horse here.
Get me a rope.
Jeb told me about the feud.
Now I understand the part I didn't know.
It all started because of your love, your guilt.
That's why you'd like to see Jeb hanged.
You don't know what you're sayin'. This is none of my askin'.
You never gave Jeb a chance. You never told him the truth so he could protect himself.
- I was trying to protect you.
- That's a lie.
- You were ashamed.
- I've paid for what I did.
I gave the boy a home.
I took him in.
That paid for all the killin's? For the way my father died, and Jeb's father?
Well, it didn't!
You loved his father.
Or are you ashamed now to remember how you loved?
No. I loved his father.
You failed him, mother, and you failed yourself.
You lost the man you loved.
He died here.
But my man won't, unless they kill me too!
You can't!
I'm sorry, Jeb, for all the wrong I did ya.
Forgive me. You didn't have to ask me that.
You've given me back my life. Oh, mother.
I told you once, Jeb, never to look back.
Look ahead.
I tell you that again now.
You couldn't then.
But now I can and will.
Take your wife home, Jeb.
{2818}{2876}Molly, your books.|- Oh my!
{2886}{2947}Put them in the trunk.|- I'll study on the train.
{2957}{3043}Why on earth did you choose|a teaching job in Wyoming?
{3053}{3128}Mother, you know|the other places wouldn't take me.
{3138}{3248}I hope you let them know who you are!|They're not getting just anybody.
{3258}{3346}Your family settled Vermont.|Your grandmother is Molly Stark.
{3356}{3423}Only 20 minutes till train time,|Mrs. Wood.
{3468}{3518}Goodbye, Mother.|- Goodbye, Oarling.
{3561}{3600}God bless you.
{3715}{3825}If it's dreadful, send me a telegram.|I'll send you money to come home.
{3835}{3933}It's going to be fine, I know it is.|Goodbye, Oarling. - Goodbye, Molly.
{3943}{4004}Goodbye, Jane. Take care of Mother.
{4099}{4203}Cheer up, Sam. You look like it's|a funeral. - It is, practically.
{4213}{4342}Molly, won't you change your mind?|- Oon't go over it all again, Sam.
{4352}{4445}It makes everything so difficult.|- Oon't you care for me at all?
{4455}{4533}Of course! More than any other man.|But it's not enough.
{4543}{4662}I don't want to settle in Bennington|forever. I couldn't stand it!
{4672}{4754}It's like being in a squirrel cage.|Oays going by, every one
{4764}{4805}like all the others.
{4815}{4914}If I came back in 10 years,|I'd find the same people,
{4924}{5052}saying and thinking the same things,|wound up like old grandfather clocks.
{5076}{5179}No, Samuel. I'd be miserable,|and that would make you miserable too.
{5228}{5266}All aboard!
{5334}{5452}Please don't be unhappy. - My family's|counting on my marrying you.
{5462}{5579}Say you found out I'm touched|in the head. - They won't believe that.
{5589}{5714}My family does. Goodbye, Samuel!|- Goodbye, Molly. I'll write you.
{6869}{6963}I wouldn't worry about it, Miss.|They don't care out here.
{6973}{7062}All they ask a teacher is,|can she count up to 100.
{7072}{7137}We'll be in Medicine Bow|in a few minutes.
{7150}{7235}Your luggage will be on the platform.|- Thank you.
{7503}{7620}We ain't in yet! Some cow outfit's|bringing in a herd.
{7639}{7716}Oon't just stand around!|Get those cows out of there!
{7726}{7829}Why doesn't somebody shoo them off?|- Those cattle are wild.
{7840}{7895}They'd trample you to bits.
{7989}{8094}"I left my darling girl behind,
{8104}{8215}She said her heart was only mine."
{8294}{8384}It's alright. These cattle never|saw a train. They're just curious.
{8394}{8510}Now they've seen it, so get them|off of there! - Yes, Sir.
{8520}{8590}Just as soon as|little Agnes finishes her lunch.
{8625}{8739}I want to get to Medicine Bow and|get some sleep. - You won't get much.
{8749}{8863}I'm paying my boys tonight.|They tend to keep the town awake.
{8907}{9001}Get them cattle off the tracks, or|I'll scare them off with my whistle!
{9011}{9074}I wouldn't do that, Sir.|We haven't lost a steer all the way.
{9084}{9188}If you stampede them now,|my boys are liable to shoot you.
{9422}{9516}Steve! - That's right.|Is my whistle that rusty?
{9542}{9597}Howdy, Virginian!
{9607}{9688}Only your outfit|would block the railroad this good.
{9698}{9791}Same old Steve.|Been 3 years, hasn't it? - Yeah.
{9801}{9917}I thought you worked for Triangle O.|- You know me. I quit.
{9927}{10032}Like when we rode together.|Some girl's papa ran you out of town.
{10042}{10149}Not this time. I'm getting old.|I want to see New York before I die.
{10159}{10182}Yours?
{10192}{10277}I don't how, but I saved it.|To see what eastern girls are like.
{10287}{10347}Get off them tracks! I'm warning you!
{10357}{10512}I haven't seen my friend in 3 years.|Ain't you got no humanity?
{10522}{10565}I'm coming through in 1 minute!
{10587}{10692}Northern Pacific's gettin' feverish.|Give me a hand, will ya? - Sure.
{11146}{11250}Hope those steers didn't scare you.|- No, it was exciting.
{11260}{11328}Especially how that man handled them.|- The Virginian?
{11338}{11405}Oh, he's from Virginia?|- Yeah.
{11415}{11470}I'm from Kansas, myself.
{11483}{11549}I see you're from the East.|- How can you tell?
{11559}{11646}By your fancy luggage.|You wouldn't be getting off here?
{11656}{11780}I would, if we ever get in.|- Just my luck. I'm heading east.
{11790}{11913}It'll spoil my whole trip.|Are you visiting? - I've come to work.
{11923}{12043}You won't have to do anything menial|like that. - I'm the new teacher.
{12053}{12146}You? A teacher?|- Yes, why not?
{12156}{12218}Could've sworn you|go to school yourself!
{12228}{12327}Tell the boys I'll pay them later|in the saloon. - Alright.
{12385}{12501}Looking for Steve? - Yeah.|- He's staking a claim.
{12511}{12586}Oh? Sure enough.|- He beat you to her.
{13046}{13125}The stage stops at the hotel, Miss.|- Thank you.
{13135}{13229}If I was you,|I'd stay in the hotel until it comes.
{13239}{13369}These cow towns can get wild at night.|Goodbye, Miss.
{13389}{13478}No, please. I'll send someone.|Could you tell me where the hotel is?
{13488}{13582}Oh, let me take you.|- Thanks, I'll find it. - It's there.
{13592}{13684}With the red front?|- That's the saloon. Further down.
{13694}{13790}Where the horses are tied?|- That's a saloon too. The other way.
{13800}{13914}Oh, I see. With the nice curtains?|- No! Oon't go there. I'll take you.
{14628}{14692}It's alright now, Ma'am.|You're safe.
{14957}{14982}Thank you...
{14996}{15104}I'm usually not so silly, but...|Thank you. - It was nothing, Ma'am.
{15114}{15208}Indeed it was! I don't know|what would have happened.
{15218}{15357}They say those things can trample you.|- Look at that terrible steer now.
{15367}{15476}Come back here!|He's such a scaredy-cat, Ma'am.
{15486}{15519}Come on, you!
{15567}{15623}I told you it was nothing, Ma'am.
{15709}{15787}Oon't mind him, Miss.|Just a little fun.
{15846}{15874}Hi, Steve.
{15893}{15929}Hi, Trampas.
{15941}{16002}Looks like you're doing alright.
{16103}{16197}He's helping a lady, Trampas.|- He acing you out again, Virginian?
{16207}{16292}That's between him and me.|- I guess so,
{16302}{16436}but I have a leaning towards ladies,|and I might deal myself in too.
{16446}{16510}It's a free country.|- That's right.
{16789}{16853}Oon't be scared. They're having fun.
{16863}{16953}It's when they get quiet.|Then watch out.
{17175}{17248}Oid you see her?|- A girl like that don't belong here.
{17258}{17371}She won't hurt you. Baldy's afraid|every woman will put a bridle on him.
{17381}{17500}Only two things I'm a-scared of:|A good woman and foot-and-mouth.
{17573}{17650}Alright, now ask me.|- Ask you what?
{17660}{17750}You rescue the prettiest girl|that ever set foot in Medicine Bow,
{17760}{17877}then you don't even ask her name.|- Oh, the girl. Well, who is she?
{17890}{17997}Well, if you're asking polite like,|she's bringin' wisdom to Bear Creek.
{18007}{18120}New teacher? - You had her on your lap|long enough for a course in grammar.
{18130}{18255}A fine way to treat a lady!|- Was she a lady? She was with you.
{18350}{18418}Can I get my wages, Virginian?|- Sure, Honey. Where were you?
{18428}{18485}Got a good meal.|- Somebody's got sense.
{18495}{18577}Whiskey on an empty stomach|hits you quicker,
{18587}{18657}but on a full stomach it lasts longer.
{18667}{18782}Another drink? - No. - What's wrong?|- I'm keeping an eye on my boys.
{18792}{18884}When I heard you were a foreman,|I laughed for a week.
{18894}{18945}I haven't got over it, myself.
{18955}{19052}We've expected you at every roundup,|Steve. How about it?
{19062}{19169}I'd have to be plenty broke|before I go back to nursing cows.
{19179}{19308}Bake all summer, freeze all winter.|Not me. I'm headed for New York.
{19318}{19397}Won't you ever settle down?|- Not till they catch up to me.
{19490}{19559}It's our chance to get in the game.|- Not this time.
{19569}{19664}I'll bet you'll never get to New York.|- 5 will get you 10. - You're on!
{19729}{19844}Trampas, deal me in. I feel lucky.|- My pleasure.
{19854}{19990}Is your friend too good for us?|- He's got to keep an eye on the boys.
{20011}{20054}It doesn't look that way.
{20079}{20163}Why don't we ask her in for a drink.|- She's a school teacher.
{20173}{20238}So what? She's human, isn't she?
{20248}{20280}Come on, let's play.
{20682}{20749}I'm sorry about your umbrella, Ma'am.
{20759}{20816}I'm sorry about that and everything.
{20846}{20876}I'm asking you to forgive me.
{20886}{21008}You call yourself a man, I suppose.|A grownup, responsible man. - Yes.
{21018}{21062}You wear a big pistol|and ride a big horse,
{21072}{21138}yet all you do is play pranks,|like any child.
{21149}{21268}Yes, Ma'am. - Is that a thing|for a responsible adult to do?
{21278}{21387}No, Ma'am. But what you say isn't|as bad as what I'm saying to myself.
{21408}{21524}I'd give my right eye if we didn't get|started off on the wrong foot.
{21534}{21564}Started off?
{21583}{21698}This is only the beginning between us.|You must know that, same as I do.
{21724}{21783}Indeed, I know no such thing!
{22003}{22116}Where'd she go? - What's it to you?|- Trampas sent the lady this drink.
{22147}{22192}I'll take it.
{22466}{22519}There's your drink, Trampas.
{22565}{22647}Is there anything wrong in offering|the lady a little refreshment?
{22657}{22713}She wouldn't understand.|She was raised different.
{22731}{22799}In my long and varied career,|I've found
{22809}{22895}that people only come|out West for three reasons:
{22905}{22992}Health, wealth, or a bad reputation.
{23012}{23077}She looks healthy and rich to me.
{23097}{23156}Stand up and tell me that's a lie.
{23213}{23270}With pleasure, you dirty...
{23326}{23389}When you call me that, smile.
{23478}{23564}With a gun against my belly,|I always smile.
{23588}{23634}Now tell me you're a liar.
{23682}{23750}There doesn't seem to be|any question about it.
{23806}{23868}That's enough for now.
{23953}{24065}I wouldn't aggravate the Virginian.|I've seen him shoot.
{24105}{24208}I knew a man that could shoot|three whiskey glasses in the air.
{24224}{24256}Pick them up,
{24276}{24301}toss them...
{24391}{24434}Say, that's not bad.
{24936}{24992}Hi, Andy.|- Howdy, Ben.
{25017}{25119}This is a friend of mine.|Take good care of her. - Oon't fret.
{25129}{25180}Aren't you the new School Ma'am?|- Yes.
{25190}{25292}It'll be awful fine having you here,|Miss... - Wood. Molly Wood.
{25302}{25409}Miss Molly. Some ornery critters here|could use some learning.
{25419}{25461}And not just the little ones.
{25704}{25800}Have a nice trip.|- Trip? - To New York.
{25823}{25854}Oh, that!
{25864}{25953}I lost my roll in a poker game.|- Already?
{25963}{26051}It's amazing, isn't it?|But I'm glad I'll still be around.
{26061}{26169}Then I may see you again.|- You sure will! - Goodbye and thanks.
{26408}{26478}I think I'll take that job after all.
{27215}{27321}Hi there, Andy.|You brought her safe, I see.
{27331}{27381}Let me help you.|- Thank you.
{27407}{27449}How are you, Ma'am?
{27459}{27503}How do you do?
{27528}{27620}You must be tired from the long trip.|- I have an awful lot of things.
{27630}{27740}So much the better. It means you'll|stay a while. - That's about it.
{27750}{27834}Thank you and goodbye, Andy.|- Bye, Miss Molly.
{27847}{27968}I'd like to ask you in, but we're|going right over to your room instead.
{28023}{28052}There's your school house.
{28062}{28152}It's brand new. A man rode all the way|from town to help build it.
{28162}{28203}It's very nice.
{28213}{28252}What's that?
{28262}{28374}Just a coyote. - Are they dangerous?|- Only to sheep and chickens.
{28384}{28500}I've never heard of them harming|a person. - You'll get used to it.
{28594}{28633}Here we are.
{28801}{28883}This is the first home we had,|till the children came.
{28893}{28960}When you wrote us|we set right to work readying it.
{28970}{29037}We sent to Omaha for that bathtub.|- Mr. Taylor!
{29059}{29099}Let me take your bonnet.
{29109}{29207}I pictured you|as a hard-faced old maid.
{29217}{29338}But you're just... How could those|Vermont men let you get away?
{29356}{29476}Have you had supper? - Along the way.|- I'll get you something. - I'm tired.
{29486}{29557}Just a cup of coffee.|- Please, don't bother.
{29567}{29635}It's no bother. I always have|something on for the hand.
{29645}{29755}I'm glad you've come, Ma'am.|Mother gets lonely surrounded by men,
{29765}{29835}and the nearest white woman|10 miles away. - 10 miles?
{29849}{29898}But the school children...?
{29908}{30040}Oistance don't mean anything out here.|The kids will ride over.
{30064}{30113}Sorry we didn't|go to meet you in Medicine Bow.
{30123}{30233}I was alright.|A very nice... cowboy helped me.
{30243}{30342}I think his name was Steve. He was|with a man they call the Virginian.
{30374}{30465}Oh, Steve Andrews. I didn't know|he was back in these parts.
{30475}{30541}They're great friends.|I know them both very well.
{30565}{30644}What's his name, the Virginian?|- Why, ah...
{30688}{30751}That's funny. I couldn't tell you.
{30791}{30823}There you are.|- Thank you.
{30833}{30945}Mother, what's the Virginian's name?|- I never heard of any other name.
{30955}{31004}That's curious.|- Not out here.
{31014}{31147}You don't ask a man his name out here.|He's Jones if he says that's his name.
{31157}{31282}You'd make a pile of money if you knew|all their names. - Not the Virginian?
{31292}{31369}No, no. He's alright.|I'm not saying anything against him.
{31379}{31495}I should hope not! - Careful,|Mother has a soft spot for him.
{31505}{31609}I have a soft spot for all cow hands.|You used to be one, didn't you?
{31619}{31722}You better get some rest. Good night.|- Good night and thank you. - Come on.
{31732}{31764}Good night.
{31861}{31980}She's not going to stay.|- I have a feeling she has spunk.
{31990}{32084}She's certainly mighty pretty.|- What do you know?
{32094}{32161}I picked you, didn't I?
{33057}{33168}School Ma'am's here!|School starts Monday in Bear Creek.
{33252}{33314}School starts at Bear Creek, Monday.
{33422}{33510}Hey, another teacher's here.|School starts at Bear Creek, Monday.
{33520}{33620}Man or woman?|- Woman. - Save me a seat.
{33711}{33803}Teacher's come.|School starts next week.
{33835}{33917}School, Mom!|- Hush! Come on, Tom, let's go.
{33927}{34063}In a minute. After I lost over|100 calves, I said this is the end!
{34074}{34153}We're moving to Montana,|where there's law and order.
{34163}{34235}We can't have men like you,|Tom, leaving the country.
{34245}{34309}If you and your family would stay...|- Why promise, Judge Henry?
{34319}{34405}You have to catch the rustlers first.|Even then, the sheriff won't help.
{34415}{34513}Then we'll do something ourselves.|- You'll have to.
{34523}{34616}I wish you'd change your mind, Tom.|- I'd stay and fight if I was single.
{34626}{34736}Tom, we have to make camp|before dark. - Alright, let's go.
{34749}{34825}So long, boys.|- Sorry to see you go.
{34994}{35093}That's the third family this year.|- I know. Who are these rustlers?
{35103}{35174}I have ideas, but I'm not accusing.
{35184}{35313}We can only keep our eyes open and act|when we know. Thank you, gentlemen.
{35379}{35517}It might be a good idea, Sir,|to give the new teacher a welcome.
{35527}{35628}To show that people|want to make a decent life here.
{35638}{35753}With a get-together and a speech,|you'd give the teacher a good start.
{35763}{35904}I thought you cow hands were against|settlers with their vegetable gardens.
{35914}{35998}Well, they're here.|And I reckon the kids need education.
{36008}{36138}Is the new teacher male or female?|- Female. But that's not the reason.
{36148}{36249}It's an excellent idea. We'll have|a barbeque and christen the school.
{36259}{36391}You might send Trampas an invite.|- Trampas? - Sure. Tell him
{36401}{36535}to bring his men. - Why Trampas?|He doesn't seem a sociable man to me.
{36545}{36616}With all of us at the barbeque,
{36626}{36711}I thought somebody|might rustle a few steers.
{36733}{36869}You're not suggesting...? - Nothing.|But I'd send him an invite. Special.
{36912}{36937}Maybe I will.
{37290}{37372}You boys getting prettied up|for the teacher? - Hello, Trampas.
{37408}{37459}Trampas and his men just rode in.
{37605}{37714}Howdy, Steve. - Hello, Mr. Taylor.|- Glad to see you back. Trampas?
{37724}{37831}Just fine, thank you.|- Boys, guns and whiskey don't mix.
{37841}{37904}If you'll be so kind, I'll take them.
{37923}{37972}There is whiskey?|- Yeah.
{37982}{38099}Before I contribute, where is it?|- In the barrel over there.
{38121}{38208}That's a fair exchange. Coming, Steve?|- You bet!
{38323}{38406}Hi, Nebraska.|- Why are you trailing him?
{38421}{38507}He's alright.|What are you sour on him for?
{38530}{38624}Welcome, folks. - How are you,|Mrs. Taylor? Your party looks great.
{38634}{38674}Go right on in.
{38710}{38744}She's right inside.
{38754}{38833}He reads already.|I taught him myself.
{38843}{38934}Show her, Christopher.|- "Culver's Baking Powder.
{38948}{39022}Absolutely pure.|This powder never varies.
{39032}{39127}Unrivalled in purity,|strength and wholesomeness.
{39137}{39255}Culver's Baking Powder,|94 Williams Street, New York City."
{39265}{39344}That's wonderful, Christopher!|- He can read every can in the house.
{39354}{39453}This one can't read a darn thing.|- He'll learn at school.
{39463}{39577}Hear that? If you can't read Monday|evening, I'll beat the tar out of you.
{39635}{39764}Mrs Jasper drove steady 70 miles|just to meet you. - 70 miles?
{39774}{39853}It was nothing. I wanted|to welcome you to your new home.
{39863}{39962}I'm afraid it isn't my home. After|the term, I'm returning to Vermont.
{39972}{40053}We have a lot of nice boys|who'll see that doesn't happen.
{40063}{40126}I heard there's one already.|A very handsome one.
{40136}{40205}Who is it?|- A certain man stood up for her
{40215}{40323}when something was said|in a saloon in Medicine Bow.
{40626}{40718}Howdy, Judge. - Hello, Taylor.|- Good to see you, Virginian.
{40728}{40833}Looks like you got everybody|within 100 miles here. - Yeah, plenty.
{40863}{40973}A perfect day for rustlers.|- I reckon we can take a chance.
{40983}{41114}You go ahead. I'll get cleaned up.|- You want me to give her the horse?
{41124}{41218}Yes. She wouldn't accept it from me.|- I didn't think you were ever afraid.
{41228}{41327}She certainly needs breaking gentle.|- The horse? - Yes, Sir.
{41362}{41459}It's no fun in a country|where bulls outnumber cows 100 to 1.
{41469}{41548}I'm thinking of moving to New York.|- I'll see you there.
{41558}{41682}You won't get there by nursing cows.|- I'll be flush. You wait and see.
{41692}{41810}Why wait? There's lots of ways to|make money fast, if you use your head.
{41837}{41939}Why didn't you wait, Steve?|- It was late, and Trampas came by.
{41949}{41993}You're not very particular.
{42003}{42121}I passed by your herd, Trampas.|My compliments on so many calves.
{42131}{42269}Seems your cows have|whole litters at a time, like a sow.
{42293}{42424}What should I do about it?|- I'd tell them to get back to nature.
{42434}{42573}You're talking trouble, my friend.|- Since when was I your friend?
{42583}{42682}Alright. Have it your way.|- Suits me.
{42707}{42831}I'm going to wash up. How about it,|Steve? If you can tear yourself away.
{42871}{42975}Yes, foreman. Be right with you.|He's my boss.
{43049}{43161}You're letting him get away with that?|- Always keep your temper, Ed.
{43171}{43270}As my sainted mother used to say:|"One trick at a time."
{43344}{43386}Anything on your mind, boss?
{43396}{43484}Listen. You were away so long,|maybe you don't know the layout.
{43494}{43618}Trampas is bad company.|- Oon't worry. He's alright.
{43628}{43733}Times are changing, and you have to|decide who you're lined up with.
{43743}{43839}You're not reading me scriptures,|Pappy? I'm grown up.
{43852}{43931}Just giving you a tip-off.|And another thing:
{43941}{44050}5 will get you 10, I'll take the|new teacher to supper. - No chance!
{44065}{44169}If I have no chance, double it.|- It's a bet.
{44197}{44252}I'll be back to collect later.
{44320}{44358}Hey! Steve, come back!
{44385}{44510}Virginian, what happened?|- Steve, that double-crossing polecat.
{44521}{44632}I bet him I could take Miss Wood|to supper, and I'll still do it.
{44704}{44813}Miss Wood, this is the Virginian.|He's responsible for this celebration.
{44823}{44883}He is? How thoughtful.
{44922}{45036}Perhaps you'd help him win his bet.|I haven't sampled that barrel yet.
{45046}{45139}I was hoping to speak with him alone.
{45195}{45224}You wanted to talk to me?
{45240}{45359}I want to know how you got the idea|you have special privileges over me.
{45387}{45444}Because I made a bet?|- Much earlier.
{45454}{45568}It seems you appointed yourself|my champion in a barroom quarrel.
{45578}{45691}Who told you that? - Ooesn't matter.|Everybody knows it, and they think...
{45711}{45849}I'm able to take care of myself.|You have no proprietary rights to me!
{45867}{45963}Nobody would think that.|- A lot of people already do.
{45973}{46034}Oo me a favor,|and keep out of my affairs!
{46044}{46120}I'm sick of your pranks|and manly protection.
{46149}{46268}Because I stood up for you? I'd have|done that for an Indian squaw.
{46490}{46602}Hello, Steve. I was looking for you.|Would you take me to supper?
{46655}{46743}Sure. I'd be tickled to death.|- Thank you.
{46753}{46857}You make me feel like a rich man.|- So I understand.
{47000}{47086}Someday you'll learn.|They just can't resist my charm.
{47096}{47173}Not that way.|She's at the corral with the judge.
{47183}{47293}From now on, you don't get a look in.|- 5 will get you 10 - I'll take you.
{47346}{47393}He'll never learn.
{47480}{47588}Which one is it going to be?|- I can't accept a gift like that.
{47598}{47717}But you must. Without a horse out here|you're like a fish out of water.
{47736}{47807}It's so hard to choose.|They're all darlings.
{47831}{47884}Could I have the pretty yellow one?
{47903}{48009}Is it good enough for her, Virginian?|- They're all good. - It's yours.
{48019}{48059}Thank you so much.
{48069}{48136}Get him out for the lady, Steve.
{48380}{48416}Oon't hurt him, now.
{48757}{48820}But he's wild.|- Never been ridden, that's all.
{48830}{48947}Judge, it's time to start the dance.|- Coming, Miss Wood? - In a minute.
{48992}{49031}Easy does it.
{49106}{49178}Get on him, Steve.|Show us how good he rides.
{49221}{49333}Careful. Oon't hurt him, now.|- If you know so much about it,
{49344}{49422}why don't you do it? I dare you.
{49450}{49518}You got a cruel streak in you, Ma'am.
{50901}{50943}Shall we dance?
{50989}{51029}Oh, yes.
{52495}{52563}Say, you learn quick.|- I've never had so much fun.
{52573}{52635}Can I get you some lemonade?|- Yes, thank you.
{52985}{53050}Would you like to go outside?|- No, I was just looking.
{53060}{53159}Oo you suppose the Virginian's back?|- He's half way to Nevada by now.
{53169}{53278}I'm afraid something's happened.|- He can ride anything with 4 legs.
{53288}{53382}Miss Molly, we put numbers in a hat|to see who gets you next.
{53392}{53451}I drew number 1.|- That's fine.
{53461}{53556}Choose your partners for polka.|- Ma'am?
{53566}{53644}Please, I feel responsible.|- Alright.
{54528}{54607}You're a very lucky horse.|You know that?
{54726}{54805}We just got back.|- Are you alright?
{54841}{54906}Sure. He's a little tired, though.
{54979}{55066}I'll take him home and gentle him up.|He'll be eating out of your hand.
{55076}{55204}I'd better return him to Judge Henry.|He gave him to me. - You do that.
{55223}{55317}Maybe you'd go riding with me?|- I'm afraid I'll be busy at school.
{55327}{55367}There's afternoons and Sundays.
{55377}{55444}I've never ridden Western style.|- I could learn you.
{55462}{55563}Teach me, not learn me. - Huh?|You teach, I learn.
{55583}{55611}That's what I said.
{55625}{55726}I meant grammar. "Teach" is|a transitive verb, taking an object.
{55739}{55824}"Learn" is an intransitive verb.|- What does it take?
{55850}{55875}Nothing.
{55914}{55982}Maybe you'd teach me this waltz.
{55992}{56106}Sorry, I'm promised for every dance.|- I'll wait till tomorrow. - Tomorrow?
{56116}{56155}That's when we go riding.
{56178}{56221}Really, you're impossible!
{56231}{56352}You take so much for granted.|I don't even know that I like you.
{56366}{56425}You will, Ma'am.|Just take your time.
{56535}{56560}What's so funny?
{56575}{56681}I thought you were woman-broke.|- Quiet down, will ya?
{56691}{56764}She's got you roped,|hog-tied and branded.
{56774}{56879}The only difference between you and|that horse is he's got sense to buck.
{57215}{57304}You like him, don't you?|- I adore him. - You ought to.
{57314}{57398}The Virginian picks good horse flesh.|- The Virginian?
{57408}{57509}That's one of the best in his string.|- No. Judge Henry gave him to me.
{57519}{57619}He did? Well,|strange things do happen.
{57629}{57724}But the Virginian showed him to me|the day he was born.
{57771}{57804}What's the matter?
{57814}{57862}I said I wouldn't ride with him.
{57872}{57955}I can't think of|a finer man to ride with.
{58308}{58424}I beat you! - You learn too fast.|I'll be losing my job as teacher.
{58749}{58862}It's still strange to me,|and a little frightening. It's so big.
{58872}{58961}I'm used to the cozy green hills|at home. The village street,
{58971}{59022}and talking to neighbors|over the garden wall.
{59032}{59139}Stay here long enough, and you won't|want to go back. It'd smother you.
{59149}{59203}I wonder.|- I tried going back.
{59254}{59406}On the farm, my brothers were saying|the same things as when I left.
{59441}{59532}I told my mother what I'd seen here,|and she liked it. Till her death.
{59553}{59646}For the others, the whole world|was just hogs and turkeys.
{59656}{59727}I put on my hat and said|I'd look in on them in 50 years
{59737}{59862}to see if they have any new subjects.|They aren't very ambitious. - You are.
{59888}{60002}I've had lots of chances|and let them slip. But not anymore.
{60028}{60124}You're the best chance I ever had.|- Please. I'm not the one for you.
{60134}{60266}You mean I'm not the right one|for you. But I'm going to change.
{60288}{60346}I didn't mean that.|- I don't aim to stay here.
{60361}{60461}I'm going to move west some day,|and do what the judge did here.
{60471}{60519}Find new land in Utah and Nevada.
{60535}{60568}Sounds fine.
{60623}{60707}It wouldn't mean anything to me|unless you were with me.
{60717}{60800}Oon't, please. - Oon't what?|- Spoil this.
{60810}{60912}These rides have been perfect.|And I want them to go on so.
{60928}{61047}I know, but you might as well|ask grain to stay green.
{61066}{61131}This may be enough for you.|It isn't for me.
{61141}{61196}If I'm going to go on seeing you...|- You're not.
{61222}{61341}At least not like this. I can|stay away easier than go on like this.
{61470}{61548}I won't press you for an answer now.|- Listen.
{61576}{61629}Oo you hear that?
{61642}{61693}Sounds like a calf.
{61714}{61775}Maybe it's hurt. You wait here.
{62627}{62707}Howdy, Virginian. - Hello, Steve.|- What are you doing out here?
{62717}{62772}Nothing special.
{62827}{62888}Oon't burn your fingers.
{62903}{62975}I'm not doing anything, Pappy.
{62985}{63106}Just putting Trampas' brand on one of|Judge Henry's calves. - It's a stray.
{63116}{63265}Sure. Following a Box-H cow.|- That's funny. I didn't see her.
{63275}{63351}Guess my eyes are getting bad.|- Listen, Steve,
{63368}{63466}we've done a lot of loco things,|but we've never stolen.
{63476}{63615}So what's a few calves to the judge?|- I'm not sore at you,
{63625}{63706}but the ranchers are sick of|rustlers trimming down their herds.
{63716}{63791}They'll send out posses with ropes.
{63807}{63906}Not for me. I've got a rope|I've been limbering up for years.
{63916}{64012}I'm talking straight, Steve.|I'm responsible for these cows.
{64022}{64070}You take life too serious, Virginian.
{64091}{64200}You'll have to choose: Quit it or take|the consequences. I won't cover you.
{64266}{64373}Alright. If that's the way you feel,|I'll make it the hard way.
{64393}{64522}You'd put me in a tough spot|if you didn't. - Can I keep my job?
{64557}{64602}Sure.
{64706}{64768}See you later.|- You bet.
{64947}{65069}What was it? - Calf.|- Was it hurt? - Just lost its mother.
{65079}{65116}Let's go back another way.
{65435}{65484}I'll take him.|- Thank you.
{65494}{65618}There's a letter for you from Vermont.|- It's just family. - Not this one.
{65628}{65707}It's from Samuel Bennett,|Elm Street, Bennington, Vermont.
{65717}{65832}Bennett? Isn't that the dude back East|that wanted to marry you? - Oude?
{65842}{65900}Sam's a very nice boy.
{65926}{66013}I guess I'll have to say goodbye.|- Goodbye?
{66023}{66128}I won't see you for quite a while.|We'll be rounding up cattle.
{66145}{66252}I'll be busy, but at least|it'll keep me from worrying about you.
{66262}{66340}You think it over.|Next time, give me your answer.
{66430}{66558}I'll try to tell you when I'm coming.|More likely I'll just show up.
{67496}{67587}The Virginian's rounding|the south side, Steve's in the north.
{67629}{67725}Take this blanket, but don't snap it|till they meet on the other side.
{67735}{67848}They'll stampede at the least sound.|We want to be ready first.
{68562}{68612}Seen anything prowling around?|- No.
{68627}{68742}Restless. Can't bed them down tonight.|- Maybe a storm's coming up. - Maybe.
{68921}{68994}When that herd starts,|there's only one way to stop it.
{69004}{69136}They'll try to get up front and|turn them. You get in behind, fast.
{69146}{69219}Cut out as many as you can,|and run them up the ravine.
{69229}{69273}Ought to get 300 at least.
{69486}{69537}Get in front and strangle 'em!
{69555}{69586}Get going!
{70521}{70546}Cut 'em off!
{70935}{71032}This has got to stop. They might have|stolen only a hundred cattle,
{71042}{71146}but we're afraid Steve was lost.|- That's tough, Virginian.
{71156}{71249}I'd do anything,|but I've got nothing to go on.
{71259}{71366}Somebody popped a blanket at them.|- Oid anyone see them pop it?
{71376}{71468}No. - Looks like your boys|fell asleep and some cattle got away.
{71478}{71568}If I go chasing after every cow|that was lost, I'd never get through.
{71578}{71629}I'm sorry, Judge.
{71665}{71781}I'd be glad to act when you|get some proof. Until then, sorry.
{71848}{71935}I've always been|a faithful servant of the law.
{71945}{72021}But I'm through backing a sheriff|who refuses to enforce it.
{72031}{72131}He's been letting cattle thieves go|for 2 years. We got to do something.
{72141}{72258}I suggest the Virginian head a posse|to run them down. - I'm not sure, sir.
{72268}{72312}You know this country best.
{72322}{72439}If we don't make an example of them,|we'll never have peace. Will you go?
{72472}{72504}Alright, Sir.
{72842}{72947}Better than herding cattle, isn't it?|- I'm still herding, aren't I?
{72957}{73043}Oo you think we're sitting|in a New York hotel? - We will be.
{73053}{73118}Just get these across the line.
{73128}{73219}200 steers at 50 dollars a head.|- 10,000 dollars.
{73229}{73316}Not bad, for 3 days' work.|- 1,500 apiece. - Not quite.
{73326}{73393}You forgot the sheriff.|- What's he done?
{73403}{73486}Absolutely nothing.|That's worth a slice, isn't it?
{73496}{73595}Those rocks run for miles.|Anybody following sure will cuss you.
{73605}{73635}That's what I want.
{73645}{73767}They'll have to ride plenty to find|tracks. - They'll ride more than that.
{73777}{73872}We're not taking them across here.|- But this trail is perfect. - Sure.
{73882}{73929}But we'll take a bath instead.
{73939}{74036}Get them in the river.|Swim them down to Boulder Creek.
{74519}{74580}Make sure|they don't leave tracks on the bank.
{74650}{74719}Not that anyone|will be looking downstream,
{74729}{74850}but as my sainted mother used to say:|"Always cover your bet."
{75224}{75319}Any sign of Steve?|- Boys are still looking for him.
{75329}{75419}I was in a cattle-run once. They|mowed over a fellow's body all night.
{75430}{75489}But they found him?|- Yeah.
{75814}{75918}Never find any tracks there.|- They would take them that way.
{75928}{75988}We're going to lose a lot of time,
{75998}{76099}but we have to circle these rocks|till we find the tracks coming out.
{76540}{76609}Hey, Nebraska. Come here.
{76648}{76773}Trampas wouldn't take them this way.|It would take him too far north.
{76783}{76902}That's why he'd do it: Because|we don't expect it. - He's too greedy.
{76912}{77001}He wouldn't drive them 140 miles|and lose weight. He'd sell 'em fat.
{77011}{77105}He'd take them south.|- Smart figuring. - There's no tracks.
{77115}{77220}What if he swam them downstream?|- That's crazy. - It's possible.
{77230}{77278}That's it. Come on.
{77573}{77605}Hold it.
{77645}{77697}See that smoke?|- Yeah.
{77710}{77739}Come on.
{77985}{78092}We don't want a fire. - But it's cold.|- Somebody might see you.
{78102}{78198}Here, quit worrying.|- We should push on.
{78208}{78278}You want to wear the cattle out.
{78288}{78420}I'll take a look at our bank account.|- I'll find a soft rock to sleep on.
{78430}{78554}We're not sleeping till we get rid|of those cows. - Forget it, Shorty.
{78564}{78663}I can see myself on Broadway,|and all the girls following me.
{78673}{78759}They say city women go crazy|when they hear the sound of spurs.
{78769}{78823}Just like catnip to a kitten.
{79090}{79182}Fire.|Pretty sure of themselves.
{79195}{79274}Spread out.|Half of you go around the other side.
{79318}{79440}That moon's awful bright.|- Shut up. And stop frowning.
{79470}{79509}Play something cheerful.
{79598}{79644}Not so loud.
{80229}{80266}Orop 'em!
{80324}{80396}What do we do?|- Every man for himself.
{80491}{80544}Get their guns, Baldy.
{80591}{80627}Where's Trampas and the rest?
{80660}{80736}Who do you mean?|We are on a hunting trip.
{80771}{80830}So are we. Tie 'em up.
{81013}{81041}Hold it there.
{81076}{81105}The next one counts.
{81277}{81381}You always could shoot.|- I hoped I wouldn't find you here.
{81391}{81493}I know. You said|a posse would be out. But don't worry.
{81503}{81562}I'll dust out of here fast.
{81665}{81696}You'll let me go, won't you?
{81788}{81832}I told you to choose, Steve.
{82240}{82333}The cattle are in the ravine.|Whoever was on lookout ducked.
{82437}{82537}Hiya, boys.|Haven't seen you since the stampede.
{82621}{82682}I caught him in the riverbed.
{82715}{82755}Tie him up?
{82850}{82903}Thoughtful of you,|building us a fire.
{82916}{83029}We smelled it halfway across Wyoming.|- I told him. - Told who?
{83062}{83090}Told me.
{83106}{83174}Alright, I shouldn't have lit a fire.
{83184}{83277}You always were a rotten liar, Steve.|Where'd Trampas go?
{83305}{83375}There's only us four.|I wouldn't lie to you.
{83389}{83441}Only the four?
{83453}{83509}You were drinking coffee from 2 cups?
{83566}{83625}Get the ropes off their saddles.
{83687}{83819}Take them to the cabin. Maybe|we'll catch the others by sunup.
{83843}{83905}Hope somebody's got a deck of cards.
{84373}{84469}What's worrying you?|- I'm getting a cold. - Shut the door.
{84593}{84714}Oon't get nervous. You only die once.|- And what's life anyways?
{84724}{84799}A few winters, waiting for spring.|A few summers, wishing they'd last.
{84813}{84890}A few bottles of whiskey.|Half a dozen girls you can remember.
{84922}{85027}Then you're six feet underground|and that's it. Now's as good as later.
{85363}{85462}No sign of 'em. They got away.|- It'd take an owl to see out there.
{85472}{85591}I told you there wasn't more of us.|Let's get this over with. - Wait.
{85601}{85693}You owe me a dollar and a half.|- I'll pay you tomorrow.
{85842}{85867}Come on.
{86275}{86378}I'll be glad when this is over.|- It won't be over for me.
{86394}{86530}I'm heading for the Teton Range.|Only one man is responsible: Trampas.
{86550}{86634}If we could be sure it was him.|- It's sure enough for me.
{86830}{86883}Just a minute, Baldy.
{86899}{86957}I want you to have this money.
{87032}{87105}Oon't worry, I didn't steal it.
{87141}{87245}Honey, your old saddle|never was any good.
{87255}{87320}You'd better take mine.|- Thanks.
{87371}{87400}Nebraska,
{87489}{87619}I'd like you to have this watch.|It's worth 4 dollars in any saloon.
{87650}{87681}Thanks, Steve.
{87774}{87819}Got a pencil?
{88091}{88141}You've got my gun.
{88349}{88395}Keep it with this.
{88426}{88486}Give it to him, later.
{88581}{88624}We're ready. Bring the horses.
{89286}{89383}Oon't worry, Shorty.|It's the best cure for a cold.
{89801}{89831}Ready?
{90021}{90072}Oo you want to say anything?
{90851}{90888}All set?
{91625}{91656}Virginian.
{91690}{91803}Steve said I should give this to you.|- Thanks, Nebraska. - Good luck.
{91965}{92097}"So long, I couldn't have spoken|without playing the crybaby."
{95361}{95453}He's alive,|but he's got a bullet in his back.
{95645}{95725}Mother will take care of him.|She's an old hand at these things.
{95735}{95851}There isn't anything you can do.|We have to wait till the doctor comes.
{96193}{96304}His fever seems to be down a little.|- Quit worrying. He'll be just fine.
{96314}{96406}You'll need a doctor yourself if|you don't rest. - I'm not a bit tired.
{96416}{96511}Nobody can do two things at once|without getting worn out, except me.
{96521}{96648}Run along, recess is almost over.|- Yes, I'd better.
{96809}{96918}Hello, boys. - Hello, Miss Molly.|- I hear the patient's better. - Yes.
{96928}{97047}Wonderful of you to come over.|- We're sort of interested ourselves.
{97057}{97194}What about Steve? He's a good friend,|and he hasn't visited. Ooes he know?
{97206}{97332}He ain't with the Box-H outfit now.|- Yeah, he left some time ago.
{97358}{97470}If you see him, will you tell him?|And tell him he left his gun here.
{97480}{97596}I sure will, Ma'am, if I see him.|- Thank you.
{97696}{97741}Let me go.|- Come on.
{97751}{97846}I don't want to be a prisoner.|Let me go. - Are you a scaredy-cat?
{97856}{97889}What are you afraid of?
{97899}{97980}I ain't afraid of anything.|- Children, what are you doing?
{97990}{98083}We're the posse.|He's a rustler and we're lynching him.
{98093}{98176}You might hurt yourselves.|- He said he would.
{98186}{98307}He said he'd be Steve. - Steve|wasn't afraid when they strung him up.
{98342}{98491}Steve, strung up? - He didn't cry.|- You don't know what you're saying.
{98501}{98594}They caught him stealing cattle.|The Virginian had to string him up.
{98682}{98749}You mean they hanged him?|- Sure.
{99421}{99466}Is it true?|- Is what true?
{99486}{99593}That Steve was hanged?|- Who had to tell you that?
{99653}{99761}Then it is true.|- Since you already know, yes.
{99823}{99941}Oid he do it? - Somebody had to.|He was in charge. It had to be done.
{99994}{100079}If we don't put the fear of God|into law-breakers, you couldn't teach,
{100089}{100214}you could ride, or leave the cabin.|Our lives wouldn't be worth anything.
{100224}{100314}It's horrible.|- Steve knew what he was doing.
{100324}{100393}He knew the law out here|and he took his chance.
{100403}{100520}No reason to feel sorry for Steve.|Feel sorry for him, in there.
{100530}{100586}He's hurt because of lawlessness.
{100598}{100705}He did what he had to: His duty.|- His duty to lynch a man?
{100715}{100834}It wasn't lynching. When you lynch|a man, you take him out of jail,
{100844}{100941}out of the rightful hands of the law.|Here we have no police, no courts,
{100951}{101048}no jails.|We have to do things our own way.
{101058}{101159}It's downright murder. - You respect|the judge. He sent the Virginian.
{101169}{101302}And he wasn't alone. All decent,|upstanding men, doing what was right.
{101312}{101421}I suppose out here you become hard,|and lose all sense of decency.
{101431}{101536}It's our law. The only kind we've got,|and I'm grateful for it.
{101546}{101661}We're building a country out here,|and there's no place for weaklings.
{101671}{101742}If that's how you feel,|you better go. You don't belong here.
{101752}{101889}I will. I'll get out as fast as I can.|- I certainly guessed you wrong.
{101899}{101985}I thought you had spunk.|When I was your age,
{101995}{102072}I drove an ox team|1,000 miles to get here.
{102082}{102177}I shot Comanches, with my father|lying dead across my knees.
{102187}{102240}My family built a country too.
{102250}{102339}They worked and died as bravely|as you westerners. Indians!
{102349}{102440}You think only you fought Indians.|Heard of the Cherry Valley Massacre?
{102450}{102485}My grandfather was killed in it,
{102495}{102559}and my grandmother|went 90 miles on foot to get help.
{102575}{102690}You're proud of them? - Of course.|- Too bad you're not more like them.
{102706}{102850}I could do everything you did,|but I have a sense of right and wrong.
{103126}{103224}The boys are stopping the stage coach.|- Thank you.
{103242}{103333}I'm sorry for how I talked yesterday.|- It's alright.
{103343}{103422}You've been like a daughter.|Going and coming in the house.
{103432}{103544}I got impatient,|like you really belonged to me.
{103562}{103666}I wish you'd change your mind.|- It's best this way.
{103676}{103740}Oid you tell him I was going?|- Not yet.
{103750}{103860}I said you were worn out nursing him,|and the doctor ordered you to bed.
{103953}{104004}Hi, Andy.|- Hi, Taylor.
{104014}{104115}Someone leaving?|- Yep. Miss Molly. - Oh.
{104231}{104275}You're not really going?
{104304}{104330}Yes, I am.
{104359}{104416}We need you bad here.
{104464}{104545}Well, goodbye, Miss Molly.|- Goodbye. Goodbye, Mrs Taylor.
{104608}{104677}Will you ride up here?
{104720}{104756}Why, certainly.
{104932}{104999}Thank you for giving me a home.
{105682}{105710}What's the matter?
{105724}{105849}You don't want to go, Miss Molly.|- Why not? - You're in love.
{105875}{105952}I most certainly am not.|And I'm going home.
{105980}{106011}You know,
{106021}{106138}in this country, once in a while|you run into a mule that's so stubborn
{106148}{106244}he don't know what's good for him.|He won't eat, won't drink.
{106254}{106376}Just to be ornery,|he'd stand in one place and starve.
{106386}{106493}The only way to make him move|is to build a fire under him.
{106503}{106534}Oh, Andy.
{106587}{106727}That's better. You could run away,|but you wouldn't be happy.
{106750}{106821}He needs you now, mighty bad.
{106860}{106923}You go on back to him.
{107011}{107087}You don't need to build a fire.
{107109}{107153}Of course not.
{107281}{107341}Teacher weds cowpoke tomorrow.
{107351}{107451}Virginian up and around after|close shave from rustler's bullet.
{107461}{107566}Nursed by future bride.
{107759}{107850}Your foreman get here yet?|- You don't see him, do ya?
{107863}{107959}I thought he might be hiding.|- He don't hide, Trampas.
{107969}{108087}When he does show up, tell him|I want to see him. I'll be in here.
{108208}{108245}This would have to happen today.
{108407}{108506}Will the boys come into town tomorrow?|- They're there already.
{108528}{108675}You think we're getting married|the right way? No fuss? - Of course.
{108685}{108754}You've left out your mother.|- She couldn't come out here.
{108764}{108860}We could go to her.|We could take the train tonight.
{108870}{108947}No, our new life|has nothing to do with them back East.
{108957}{109008}Someday we'll go. Not now.
{109018}{109110}Tomorrow we'll be in the mountains.|There's an island between two streams.
{109120}{109227}Cool, with the smell of pines.|I've camped there lots of times.
{109240}{109303}I hope you like it.|- I'm sure I will.
{109428}{109549}Thought you'd never get here.|- Welcome. The bride sure is pretty.
{109574}{109647}Looks more like you're|going on a trip than getting married.
{109657}{109749}Ma'am, can we borrow him?|- Can I trust you to return him?
{109759}{109871}We'll be good. - Well, pretty good.|- Whom can I believe? - Neither.
{109881}{109975}I'll change my clothes.|- I wouldn't change them.
{110085}{110183}Oon't run off with my bag.|- See you in a minute.
{110193}{110289}You're sure you don't mind if I go?|- Of course not. - I won't be long.
{110299}{110401}I'll be busy with the dressmaker.|- I'll wait to see your wedding dress.
{110411}{110482}Not until the ceremony.|It's bad luck.
{110492}{110577}Then I'll go quick.|I'm not taking any chances.
{110638}{110692}Go on, the boys are waiting.
{110771}{110814}What is it?|- Trampas. He's in there.
{110824}{110919}He wants trouble.|He's drinking and talking plenty.
{110929}{110979}Let's have a drink.
{111012}{111048}Across the street.
{111099}{111168}My last drink with you single.|- Here's to luck.
{111178}{111250}Someday, maybe I'll step out too.
{111275}{111417}There's a friend of yours in town.|- Oid he mention he was my friend?
{111435}{111549}Well, he said a lot of things.|- Forget it. - I always do.
{111559}{111595}Give us another drink.
{111611}{111723}He said he'd be back,|if you're interested. - We ain't.
{111774}{111846}We'll take this off your hands.|- All of us. - No thanks, boys.
{111856}{111953}Just say the word.|- It's a matter between the two of us.
{111963}{112072}And I hope he don't drift around.|- You got to think of her.
{112082}{112120}Who else would I be thinking of?
{112194}{112290}I'm acting mayor. I could lock him up|till after you're married.
{112428}{112539}I'm sick of this monkeying around.|You!
{112560}{112594}You there.
{112669}{112800}You've been saying|I'm the boss of the rustlers you hung.
{112821}{112913}Now, tell me.|- No fighting here. - Shut up.
{112927}{112955}You heard.
{113005}{113082}Trampas,|I don't want trouble with you now.
{113095}{113203}No, you've been dodging for years.|You won't do it any longer.
{113236}{113272}Are you sure you mean that?
{113282}{113376}Oon't bluff. I'm calling your hand.|- What have you got?
{113394}{113516}That you're a lying skunk. The country|isn't big enough for both of us.
{113526}{113579}You've got till sundown to get out.
{113633}{113689}Too bad you said that, Trampas.
{113704}{113735}Get out!
{113757}{113851}Get out by sundown,|or I'll shoot you on sight.
{113977}{114101}I guess it had to come. - We'll see|that his men don't help him. - Thanks.
{114280}{114354}The sun will be down|in less than half an hour.
{114364}{114476}Oo it quick and right. I want to|enjoy the wedding. - Are you worried?
{114486}{114524}Who, me?
{114571}{114667}Oon't tell her till it's over.|She wouldn't understand.
{116423}{116452}Open the door!
{116583}{116693}It's been awful waiting for you.|I wanted to find you. They told me.
{116703}{116792}I'm sorry they did.|- Never mind, I've got you now.
{116821}{116927}I wish you didn't have to wait alone,|but it won't be long.
{116944}{117035}I gave him a chance|to change his mind, twice.
{117045}{117143}But he stood to it. He knows|he went too far to go back on it.
{117153}{117259}He'll have to go to the finish now.|- The finish? You're not going to...
{117269}{117311}I won't let him shoot me.
{117321}{117398}But you're not staying here,|now that I know. We can get away.
{117408}{117495}I have to stay, Molly.|- But why, when there's a choice?
{117505}{117601}He did the choosing, not me.|If people thought I was a coward...
{117611}{117728}No one will think you're a coward.|It's just pride, your idea of honor.
{117738}{117776}It's childish, ridiculous.
{117790}{117888}If I ran away, I could never|look my friends square in the eye.
{117898}{117923}Or you, either.
{117944}{118033}Can't you see how it is?|- No. Perhaps I should, but I can't.
{118043}{118173}I kept saying to myself, "Hanging|those cattle thieves was his duty."
{118183}{118315}But you don't have to do this. When|I think of tomorrow... - Listen. - No.
{118325}{118412}If you do this, there won't be|a tomorrow. I won't come back again.
{118472}{118547}Can you look at me and say that?
{118594}{118619}Can you?
{118659}{118746}Oon't do this.|For my sake. Please.
{118833}{118882}I haven't any choice.
{121286}{121396}I'll go to the post office.|- You haven't finished your drink.
{124020}{124087}Got him.|Cold as a canned mackerel.
{124187}{124247}Oarling, you're safe.
{124257}{124303}It wasn't you.
Yes, madam?
I'd like to see my nephew, please,
Wesley McQueen.
Sorry, no visitors.
Governor's orders.
But this is his birthday.
I baked him a cake.
I've come all the way Kansas just to see him.
His, uh, Uncle Pluthner sent him the prayer book.
I knitted him the socks.
We'll see that he gets them, madam.
I wanted to tell Wesley about his folks
And about the farm.
And, oh, about his horse.
The one he used to ride when he was a little boy.
You tell him his Uncle Pluthner has broken him to a buggy now.
And he takes good care of him.
Yes, ma'am. We'll tell him about his horse.
Thank you, thank you.
It's a white horse.
A white horse.
Tell him we pray for him to be set free.
He's innocent, you know.
Just a mischievous boy.
He never really done anybody any wrong.
Never done anybody any wrong.
Only held up four banks.
And the Missouri and Pacific Railroad. Twice.
Like she says, mischievous.
Hank, cut into that cake.
Nothing in it.
Eat a piece.
Mm, not bad.
Try a piece.
No, thanks.
It might be poisoned.
Here, take the big innocent rattlesnake his goodies.
Happy birthday, McQueen.
Some presents from your aunt.
Don't you want to hear what she had to say?
I'm listening.
She said to tell you that the white horse
You used to ride when you was a kid
Is now pulling your Uncle Pluthner's buggy.
See you off to Leavenworth in the morning.
McQueen is not gonna like getting up this early.
Well, he can catch up on his sleep
On the way to Leavenworth.
Sound the alarm.
Get a posse together fast.
Where the heck did he get this?
On the end of this,
I imagine.
But how'd he get that?
On the end of this.
But how did he get that...?
Don't tell me. I know.
And the dear old lady knitted them herself.
[RINGING]
You Pluthner?
That's right.
Pinkerton man, ain't you?
I used to be, but I resigned.
The old man must think a lot of you.
Since when's he been hooking up with gumshoes?
Don't worry, I'm all right.
I handle things for him at this end.
He's out in the Colorado Territory.
Oh, here's your route and some money.
He wants to see you as quick as you can got there.
I owe him that.
You owe him more than that.
Cost him a pile of cash to bust you out.
He's got a big job set up for you.
A chance to get rich.
I've been rich.
When I couldn't get a breath of fresh air
Or feel the ground under my feet.
Yeah? Well, don't get any ideas you're through with us.
You wouldn't last long cut off from the herd, McQueen.
They'll brand you clean to the bone.
Hello, mister.
Howdy.
Who lives here now?
The Martins.
Used to be the McQueen's place.
You heard of Wes McQueen?
Pa says they're fixing to hang him over in Missouri.
Who's your pa?
Our name's Turner.
Tommy Turner?
How's your sister?
Martha?
She's gone.
Where?
Look at that, Julie Ann.
You can see all the way into the middle of next week.
It's a new world we're going into, that's what it is.
The start of a new life.
Saying it won't make it so, Pa.
[STAGECOACH RATTLES]
Great day in the morning!
Well, sir, you had quite a snooze, didn't you?
My name is Winslow.
Fred Winslow.
This is my daughter,
Julie Ann.
Your name, sir?
Uh, Rogers.
Chet Rogers.
FRED:
You new to this country,
Mr. Rogers?
It's a promised land, sir, that's what it is.
My father used to say,
"The sun travels west and so does opportunity."
My daughter and I, we've left the past behind us.
Yes, sir, we, uh, had a little farm back in Georgia.
But then, uh, soil was beat out, crops poor, prices bad.
So we sold out everything we had, lock, stock and barrel.
That is, everything except our household goods
And we freighted them out ahead of us.
They're waiting for us now at Medicine Hat.
Mr. Rogers isn't interested in our personal history, Pa.
Huh.
My daughter's still a wee might homesick, sir.
But she'll be all right
Once she sees the place waiting for us out here.
I used to live on a farm.
FRED:
That right?
My people were farmers.
I've been thinking I might get a place out here myself.
Wait till you see our place, sir.
We bought it from some agents back in Georgia.
Plenty of fine water.
Best soil in the Territory,
Corral for 50 horses.
Five hundred head of the finest,
Slickest cattle you ever laid your eyes on.
Now, what more can a man ask?
Hey, wait a minute.
Get down.
Get down on the floor.
Get down, honey.
Get down like the man says.
[GUNSHOTS]
[GUNSHOT]
[GUNSHOT]
[GUNSHOT]
Please, Lord, carry your sinful children safely
Through the journey and take us across the River Jordan.
Lord, give that young man strength and guidance.
And, please, Lord, forgive me for praying with my hat on.
I...
Oh, Lordy, Lordy, Lordy!
One hour for dinner.
One hour for dinner.
Where's Charlie and Bill?
They had an accident.
Most stupendous thing you saw in your life.
Six hold-up men, and this gentleman
Took them on single-handed and saved us.
The guard got most of them
Before they got him and the driver.
Did they get the money box?
Safe and sound. Right up there.
Hey, Marshal, mister you can tell them what happened.
MAN:
Marshal got a tip this outlaw,
Wes McQueen, is headed for the Territory.
Marshal, the stage was held up.
Charlie and Bill were killed.
MAN:
Here's the gentleman who brought it in.
Meet, uh... What'd you say your name was?
Chet Rogers.
You was on the stage?
On it? Mister, he saved it.
He took on six bandits single-handed. Six!
And he killed 'em all.
I thought the Day of Judgment had come.
I... Look at that.
Look at that bullet hole.
If that stagecoach had bounced up instead of down,
That hole would have been right through my head.
Oh!
The guard got three of them.
I got two.
The other one got away.
Can you describe him?
Oh, big fella.
About 6'4", I'd say.
Long hair.
Too bad you missed him.
That sounds like Wes McQueen.
You'd have been $5000 richer.
Looks like I had an expensive morning.
Where'd he jump you?
About 8 miles back, right after we left the canyon.
Come on.
I wanna thank you, Mr. Rogers, for what you did.
You're a brave man.
And if ever you find yourself up around our way,
The Rancho Del Sol,
We'd be mighty glad to see you.
Wouldn't we, Julie Ann?
You'll be most welcome.
Goodbye, sir.
Goodbye, sir.
Mister, the way I figure it,
You got quite a reward coming from Wells Fargo.
Just leave your name and address
And our superintendant'll get in touch with you.
Thanks, but I'll settle for a good horse and saddle.
You got 'em, mister.
Howdy.
Howdy.
What do they call this place?
You're in the Canyon of Death, mister.
What's that up there?
That?
That's the City of the Moon.
Leastways, that's what the Injuns call it.
A dead city hanging in space.
How far to Todos Santos?
Oh, that's way north of here.
Sits in the mountains.
Over the top of that ridge.
You ain't headed for there, are you?
Why not?
I'll tell you about Todos Santos, mister.
Strictly the back end of nothing.
The Spaniards moved in first.
Injuns come along and massacred 'em.
Then the pox come along and took care of the Injuns.
Left nothing but scorpions and Gila monsters.
Then an earthquake come along and took care of them.
Ain't nobody gone there since, mister.
Less'n some rattlesnake maybe got himself lost.
Well, I ain't lost.
Who are you?
I'll do the asking.
That's McQueen, all right.
It sure fits the old man's picture of him.
Glad you got here, McQueen.
We're in old Dave's setup with you.
I'm Duke Harris.
This is Reno Blake.
Where's the old man?
He stays in Potrero.
How far is that?
About 60 miles.
What do you think of the hideout?
Looks all right.
It is all right.
I picked it.
Reno's an expert on hideouts.
Who's boss here?
A debatable issue.
Do you mean physically or intellectually?
I'll talk to you.
The great Wes McQueen.
Just a big Kansas jay.
Reno and I are quartered in that broken-down hacienda.
The girl has a room upstairs.
Anything else with a roof on it?
Well, we reserved the old Indian kiva for you
If you're not bothered by ghosts.
The tribal council chamber,
Mr. McQueen.
Gathering place of the medicine men,
The seats of the mighty.
No longer occupied.
You talk kind of fancy.
Only philosophizing,
Mr. McQueen,
On my favorite subject: Doom.
When it's got you marked, you're already dead.
What's the girl doing here?
You don't have to worry about her.
Why not?
She's stupid, McQueen.
She thinks loyalty a virtue.
Reno met her in an El Paso dance hall.
There was a bit of shooting.
He cleared out to save his hide and he took her with him.
For some obscure reason she's grateful.
Where do you two fit in with the old man?
A large payroll is the bond that unites us.
It travels by the Denver
Rio Grande up to Potrero.
A Mr. Wallace, the railroad conductor,
Will tell us the next date of shipment.
So the details of execution are in your hands.
Is Wallace in touch with the old man?
He'll be up to talk to you on his day off.
I'll do my own talking to the old man.
That's all.
I take it
I'm dismissed.
And get that girl out of here.
There are two of you and one of her, savvy?
To be accurate,
Mr. McQueen,
There are now three of us and one of her.
Yes, sir.
Pickings must be awful easy back in Kansas,
A big jay like McQueen can get a reputation.
I didn't see you tangling with him.
What're you looking for, a punch in the nose?
Well, what'd the big noise have to say?
Very little.
Colorado, you can start packing.
What's eating you?
McQueen's orders.
This is to be a bachelor club from now on.
Why, that overgrown jailbird.
He's not boss around here any more than I am.
He can't come in...
Keep it up, Reno.
You may talk yourself into winning this argument yet.
You getting tired of living, Duke?
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it!
Instead of fighting with each other,
Why don't you go over and tangle with him?
Yeah.
Trouble is we might need him for this job.
A rather obvious point.
Well, give my regards to the girls in El Paso.
I ain't there yet.
I'd like to talk to you, Mr. McQueen.
Help yourself.
Duke tells me
I have to pull out.
That's right.
What if I tell you
I don't want to go?
I'm telling you, you do.
But I don't wanna go back to El Paso.
Why not?
I've been there.
Look, I don't care where you go.
I don't want you around here, see?
Maybe you think
I know too much.
Maybe you're afraid
I'll talk.
Maybe.
Well, if I was you, I'd do my worrying about Wallace.
The conductor?
He's the gabby one.
Besides, there's nobody up here to talk to.
I should think this is where you'd want me to be.
Look, I ain't so worried about you,
It's those two sage rats you're tied up with.
Next thing you know, they'll be throwing lead over you.
I can handle them.
You're pretty sure of yourself.
That's right.
Can I stay?
You in love with this fella Reno?
No.
Then what's the big attraction?
I like it here.
[SCOFFS]
Look, I'm not hiding out, if that's what you're thinking.
You ought to understand.
Yon don't wanna go back to jail.
Well, I don't wanna go back to the dance hall.
That's right.
I didn't like jail,
But I did something about it.
I busted out.
Maybe that's what I'm doing.
All right, we'll give it a couple of days,
See how it works out.
Thanks, Mr. McQueen. Thanks.
Don't worry about your horse.
I'll feed him and water them.
What happened between you and McQueen?
Why'd he let you stay?
Maybe he likes the way she combs her hair.
Yeah, maybe he does.
She never piled a plate like that for you, Reno.
Leave that there.
If he wants to eat, he can come in and get it.
You want more?
Yeah.
Get it.
You're losing your grip, Reno.
She's looking for trouble.
So are you.
Want some breakfast?
Oh, I was wondering about that.
We don't serve fancy, but it's hot.
I was trying to figure you out last night.
Didn't keep you awake, did it?
Nothing keeps me awake,
Miss, uh...
By the way, what is your name?
Colorado.
Colorado Carson.
Colorado. You born in these mountains?
My mother.
She was part Pueblo.
I guess she was homesick when she named me.
And your old man?
Boss cowhand down on the Pecos country.
Grew up there.
Pretty tough place for a kid.
It was all right as long as Pa was living.
After that, it was either the Comanches
Or the cowpokes.
I don't know which was worse.
You know, "Let's go look at the moon."
That was on clear nights.
Rainy weather it was,
"Let's go inside the barn
And pitch a little hay."
You probably play that game yourself.
So?
After Ma died, I headed out for San Antone.
Got myself a job in a Wild West show,
Shooting glass balls with a rifle.
Riding broncs.
Broke my leg twice.
Looks pretty straight to me.
Straight enough to get myself a job dancing the honky tonk.
[LAUGHS]
Then the owner decided
I ought to sing.
That's when the shooting started.
Next stop, El Paso.
Anything else you wanna know?
No. I think I understand.
Just so you get one thing straight.
It wasn't Reno brought here.
Maybe it's these mountains.
Maybe there's more of my mother in me than I thought.
[HORSE APPROACHING]
That's the train conductor.
Well, if it isn't old Denver and Rio Grande himself.
Yeah, and it's too bad they don't run a train up here,
Because I'm no horseman.
And after that long ride...
Ooh. I'm gonna stick to railroading.
Sit down and rest yourself.
RENO:
Long haul back to Aztec and no short cuts.
On your way home don't run into any mountain goats.
[LAUGHS]
They're liable to bite you.
McQueen, this is our contact man, Homer Wallace.
Well, it sure is a pleasure,
Mr. McQueen.
Do you mind if I call you Wes?
What's your play, Wallace?
Huh? Oh.
[LAUGHING]
Well, uh, I... I unlocked the baggage car for you.
Well, you got a gun on me, of course, what can I do?
I can't do nothing except act scared...
You are scared, ain't you?
Huh? Huh? W-who me?
[LAUGHING]
Well, to tell you the truth, Mr. McQueen,
I never threw in on anything like this before.
I'm a respectable man.
Well, you can ask anybody in the town of Aztec.
That's the junction.
Yeah, I live there, me and my wife.
Well, everybody knows me.
I'm a family man and a lodge man and...
Gabby old buck, isn't he?
You've seen the old man?
Uh, I... I saw him just yesterday.
He wants to have a talk with you.
I wanna have a talk with him too.
WALLACE:
Well, he's waiting for you.
Here, uh... Here's his address in Potrero.
He wants you to ride the train in
And kind of size things up on the way.
I'm sizing things up right now.
WALLACE:
Huh?
Reminds me of a little hoist we'd planned in West Kansas
About five, six years ago.
One fellow was smooth, slippery.
The other was green and gabby.
The third was just plain mean
From the top of his head to his boot heels.
Next thing we knew there was a boxcar of soldiers
Coupled onto that train.
Too bad we never knew which one sent word to the soldiers.
Been better for the other two if we had.
Their monuments are right outside of Barksville, Kansas.
Prettiest little bone orchard you ever see.
Little stone angels watching over them.
[COUGHING]
Well, I, uh, guess
I better be going.
Take care of yourselves.
You too.
[SCOFFS]
You sure scared the pants off him.
I'll ride that train into Potrero tomorrow.
Hell, Mr. Rogers.
Evening, Miss Julie Ann.
This Indian woman is looking for water for her sheep.
Yeah, don't seem to be much water hereabouts.
Then you've seen our ranch.
Rancho Del Sol, a new life, adventure.
Opportunity travels with the sun, remember?
I kind of thought your Pa was expecting too much.
Where's the 500 head of cattle?
Five hundred?
Less than a dozen.
Walking around like dead things.
Pa sent them ranging to find water.
Barely enough here for the horses.
He packed off before sunup to try digging a new well.
Your Pa's got a lot of gizzard.
You're lucky to be his daughter.
I guess he's lucky too.
I try hard.
Well, Mr. Rogers.
Doggone, if I ain't, whoa, glad to see you.
You're sure a sight for sore eyes.
How you getting along?
Well, you... You can see for yourself, sir.
I'm just a hunk of bait thrown to the sharks.
The, uh, land sharks, that is.
And I sure got gobbled up.
In me you will see a shorn lamb,
With nothing left to offer you but his bleat,
But you're welcome to that.
You got stung, all right.
Yeah. My boy, never buy a foot of land
More than 5 miles from home.
And not then till you've seen it,
Felt it, tasted it and smelt it.
At that, you might get bamboozled.
I wish we could go right back home.
Julie Ann, we can't go right back home.
You know that.
Not a red cent left, Mr. Rogers.
No brains, just chasing a pot of gold.
You expect to dig a well with those tools?
With them things, I couldn't dig a hole in a swamp.
But then a man's gotta use the tools
He can lay his hands on.
Yeah, don't worry,
Mr. Winslow, you'll make out.
Yeah, Julie Ann,
Chet's staying for supper.
Oh, no, I'm just on my way to the railroad.
I can't stay.
I got a little business in Potrero.
Well, let it wait.
Take tomorrow's train.
We'd be pleased if you'd stay.
Yeah.
I'll get supper.
Julie Ann's a mighty fine cook too.
Did you ever think you'd like to travel a long way off?
As far and as high as the moon?
Stay there for good and ever.
Forget all about things down here?
There's been plenty of times
I wanted to get away from where I was.
That far away?
Yeah, that far.
You never talk about yourself.
I don't know anything about you at all.
There's nothing to tell.
Like you said: Wanting to get far off from what you been.
This is far off.
I thought we were getting a fine house, good land.
I thought maybe in a year or so
I could take a trip back home.
Maybe ride the train this time.
With fresh money in your purse.
How did you know?
I had the same idea myself once.
Might work out yet, Julie Ann.
How fast can this thing go?
I can push her to 25 miles.
Man, that's sure rolling along.
Mister, what are you doing in there?
Looking for a place to sit down.
Ain't there any seats on this train?
Plenty of them up in the passenger coach.
Oh.
That rube'll get his pockets picked
Before he gets to the junction.
[LAUGHING]
Board! Aboard!
[BELL CLANGING]
What's the fare to Potrero?
Uh, $1.80.
What's the next stop?
Well, there's a flag station at Pine Flats.
Look, if you wanna know...
That's all.
The old man inside?
Yes, in there. He's sick.
[WHISTLING]
Wes McQueen, you old buffalo.
That call sure took me back a long way.
Glad to see you, Dave.
You're looking good.
You're a liar.
I know what I look like.
What's wrong with you?
Everything.
Can't eat, can't sleep.
[LAUGHS]
Doc says I'm paying for past sins.
Have a drink, Wes.
You supposed to have that stuff?
Oh, why not?
All gotta die sometime.
Me, you, the whole cockeyed world.
Doesn't make much difference what kills us.
How about the job I got set up?
Looks good, huh?
Dave, the reason
I came here
Was to thank you for busting me out.
Oh, forget it.
Sorry I couldn't have got you out sooner.
You like the deal you're gonna pull?
The deals all right, Dave,
But it's me, I...
All the time I put in down there
Got me to thinking.
About what, Wes?
I'm through with the game, Dave.
I'm quitting.
I wish I was a young buck.
I'd do the job myself.
I can't hardly get out of this blasted chair.
I'd like to pull it for you, Dave,
But I've been figuring on settling down.
Getting a farm someplace.
You ride this one, you can buy 20 farms.
Aw, don't let me down, Wes.
I'm just about clean.
Spent a lot of money this last six months.
Busting me out, huh?
Oh, you'd do the same for me.
But I counted on this.
Set me up for life.
[SIGHS]
Well, I guess one more won't hurt.
[LAUGHING]
Aw, sure it wouldn't, Wes.
You'll pitch in, won't you?
I'll ride with you, Dave.
Sure scared the liver out of me.
You meant what you said about being broke?
[CHUCKLES]
There's the kitty, Wes.
Two thousand dollars.
Take any part you want.
I'll take half.
You can have it back out of my end.
All right.
A thousand for you and a thousand for me.
Thanks, Dave.
I'll head straight here with the swag.
Anything happens to me, you know where to find the wife
Back in Joplin.
See she gets my cut.
You'll be all right.
Nothing's gonna happen to you, you old coonhound.
[LAUGHING]
Sort of making you my executor, ain't I?
Well, I wouldn't want to leave it up to Reno or Duke.
What rat hole did you raid to find that pair?
Friends of Pluthner.
He'd sell you out for a nickel cigar.
Oh, no, you're wrong there, Wes.
Once a gum boots, always a gum boots.
Now, don't you worry about Pluthner.
He's the one hombre we can count on.
You both got it straight?
We need McQueen for the heist.
Keep him fat for it.
Soon as it's through, so is he.
Well, even Reno can understand that.
I been saving one for that big jay.
I'll let him have it right on schedule.
Hm, not from the front.
But not from too far back.
If you miss, McQueen don't serve no second helpings.
I won't miss.
I'll drink to that.
You show up at Rickard's house with the haul,
We make it a three-way divvy.
What about Rickard?
What about him?
He can't reach for a gun or stand on his legs.
Come in, come in.
Well, hello, Chet.
I'm glad to see you.
It sure was nice of you to drop back.
Give me your hat.
No, I can't stay a minute.
I got a long ride before dark.
Well, have you had something to eat?
Yeah, sure.
Hello, Chet.
I brought you something.
What is it?
Go ahead, open it.
Oh, Chet, you shouldn't be spending your money that way,
To bring us presents.
We... We...
Pa.
Look at her, boy.
Look at her.
You put the light of life into her face.
Oh, it's beautiful.
I hope it fits.
We'll soon find out.
I'll only be a minute.
Now, sit down, Chet.
Sit down.
That dress sure must have cost a heap of money.
I got lucky in Potrero.
Fell onto a poker game.
Here's $900.
More then you'll need for well digging.
Nine hundred...
No, I... No, it's...
I don't know what to say.
No, it's no use.
I... I can't take it, Chet.
Why not?
Because I know why you brought it.
It's on account of Julie Ann.
I know, I know,
But it's all on account of her.
You see, there's a little matter that you don't know about.
About Julie Ann?
Yeah.
I got to be honest with you, boy.
There's a fella back home, name of Randolph.
Randolph sells the bell cows back there.
Martha's in love with him, is that it?
Martha?
I meant Julie Ann.
I meant Julie Ann.
Well, I don't know.
She still writes to him.
Well, I don't know.
She still writes to him.
They figure on getting married?
No. Randolphs don't marry with river bottom folks.
You got to live it to understand it, boy.
That's why you brought her out here.
You can't blame her, boy.
She's not bad, she's just...
Just young, that's all.
She sure did want to live up in that Randolph mansion,
Way up there on the bluff.
You know, a girl gets crazy ideas sometimes.
Anyway, I... I sure thank you for the offer.
I'm not giving the money to her.
I'm giving it to you.
You like her, don't you?
Why don't you tell her so?
Maybe you could get that
Randolph fella out of her head.
She likes you too.
Yes, she does.
FRED:
Well, look at her, look at her.
She's as cute as a bug's ear.
It fits perfect.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Oh, I'll unsaddle your horse.
You're gonna stay to supper, aren't you?
No, no. I... I can't stay.
I'll be coming back, though.
We'd always be glad to see you, Chet.
Remember you said I never talked much about myself?
Good reason why.
I got another life to get done with, once and for all.
It won't take but a few days.
Then I'll be back.
We'll be here, Chet.
Thank you, Julie Ann.
Goodbye, Mr. Winslow.
Goodbye, son, goodbye.
You will come again right soon, won't you?
Remember what I said that day back in the stagecoach?
The Promised Land, I said.
And I was right too.
You won't find a man like Chet Rogers back home.
[DOOR BANGING]
Is that you, Wes?
What's going on?
What happened?
Reno.
He went crazy.
Got to drinking with Duke.
You know how Duke is.
He likes to hurt people.
Took it out on me.
Well, I couldn't stand it no longer.
I threw a bottle at him.
Yeah.
Reno wasn't any help.
He said I'd been looking for trouble
Ever since you came here.
I thought you said you could handle them.
They went crazy,
I tell you.
Reno hit me, then waded in on Duke.
I ran over here and locked myself in.
Where are they now?
Out by the church somewhere.
Reno didn't have his gun on.
Duke did.
Reno had to take to the dark.
Duke is hunting him out like a rabbit.
You stay here.
Let them alone, Wes.
Let them kill each other.
[GUNSHOT]
Come on out, Reno.
Come on, move.
Who do you think you're bulling around?
Move, I said.
Colorado, come here.
You two had fun mussing her up, huh?
Self-defense, McQueen.
You slapped her around.
She had it coming to her.
You stinking rats.
Here, work them over.
Oh, what's the use?
You don't get off that easy.
Don't, Wes. It don't matter.
Now, wait a minute, McQueen.
We gotta start pulling together.
The heist comes off Friday.
Who told you?
Some crony of the old man's.
All right. Turn in.
I'll give you the layout in the morning.
Get out of line again,
I'll kill both of you.
Get your bed roll and bring it in here tonight.
Where'd they get the bottle?
Pluthner brought it.
Pluthner?
That's what they called him.
He's the big scissor-bill
That brought the message about the payroll.
You know him?
Yeah. I know him.
Martha.
Martha.
Martha.
Wait. Don't go.
Don't go.
Where are you going?
I'm getting out of Todos Santos.
Come on back here.
Who's Martha?
Martha?
You was dreaming out loud.
Must have been.
Are you in love with her?
We was gonna get married.
What stopped you?
She's dead.
It wouldn't have done no good.
What do you mean?
Marrying her wouldn't have helped none.
You bust out of jails maybe,
Or mud holes like I was in,
But you can't bust out of what you are.
You can if you're set on it.
Can you?
Me. Hm.
I was born under a chuck wagon.
Never got much higher.
Anything was a step up.
Even getting hit by Reno was all velvet.
He won't do that again.
He had a right to.
He knew Duke was right when he said it was you I wanted.
Hold me, Wes.
Hold me.
It won't work.
I've got plans.
There's no room in them for you.
Not for the long pull.
Maybe there won't be no long pull.
Maybe it all ends
Friday on that train.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's where it ends.
Everybody takes his own road after that.
Reno. Duke. Rickard.
You and me.
We're all through then.
WES:
There's the railroad.
There's a good stand of trees
At Pine Flats you can hide out in
Until I signal you to board the train.
Colorado, if we make this haul, you're in on it.
Right?
There's a small bridge at Luckman's Pass.
You wait there with the extra horses.
That gives you just about four minutes to get that safe open.
It'll be open.
I only hope those train guards
Give us an argument.
If there's anything I hate, it's railroaders.
Don't be getting a trigger itch.
I don't want any funerals on this picnic.
Did, uh, Pluthner have anything else to say?
Pluthner?
You forgot to mention him, didn't you?
You know, the bird that brought you that whiskey yesterday.
Oh.
Was that his name?
I just knew he was a friend of the old man's.
[BELL RINGING]
WES:
Nice, private hideout you picked.
Ain't supposed to be anybody around here.
Welcome.
I'm glad to see this old bell has a small voice after all.
A sky pilot, uh?
I am Brother Tomas.
Year in and year out,
I travel the trail of the missions,
Keeping the chapels in order.
Stopping often to ring the poor, old broken bell of Todos Santos.
Not that it can be heard very far.
Well, that's good.
The ways of the Lord are strange and wondrous.
In the... In the foundry at Aztec there is a bell cast of bronze.
Its tone is clear, its call will carry far.
Ha! For 10 years it has lain there.
Aztec's not far away.
It is not a matter of distance, child, but of money.
When we receive enough offerings
To pay for it,
Then it will hang high and sound its call.
[LAUGHING]
Perhaps, then, the Indians will come back.
We will even rebuild the mission of Todos Santos.
Oh. Thanks be to the travelers who dropped this offering here.
Nothing is too small.
I didn't know it was there.
I'm quite sure you didn't.
Nothing is too small.
Time to be riding.
Good luck, Wes.
Do you travel far?
Far enough.
May God be with you.
Vaya con Dios.
Mrs. Wallace?
Yeah?
Is your husband at home?
No, he's down at the train, about ready to take her out.
Oh, I guess I'm too late for that job I was hoping to get.
What job?
Guarding the payroll shipment.
I figured they might need some more guards.
They ain't short.
The marshal himself's riding the train.
Homer had four of his deputies in for poker last night.
He think that's enough?
More than enough, if you ask me.
The hold-upper they're expecting is only priced at 10,000.
I told Homer he'd be sorry
He took them other fellers in on it.
Just makes less for him.
You're right, ma'am, you're right.
Don't forget, Marshal,
I'm the one that tipped you off.
The big end of the reward money's mine.
You'll get it.
All right. Get aboard.
Board! Board!
There's a flag stop at Pine Flats.
Maybe he'll get on there.
Maybe Pine Flats.
Wallace!
Good heavens above.
One more double shuffle, you're dead meat.
Call those two guards out here.
Tell them the marshal wants to see them.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Dan. Johnny.
The, uh, marshal wants you.
Heist them.
Get rid of their guns,
Wallace.
Yes, sir.
Now jump.
Jump!
Get over on this other platform.
Oh, yes, sir!
All right. Now, pull that coupling pin.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Your wife seemed awful interested in that reward money.
My wife?
Maybe if she don't skin you alive
For not bringing it home,
I'll drop in and take care of you.
McQueen's outfoxed us.
He's run off with the baggage car,
Tortured the guards and massacred the engine boys.
Blood's a-running down the track.
Don't go out there.
This is the smoothest run we ever made, friend.
We're breezing along like a race horse.
When I fire them, ha, they snort.
WES:
Keep it snorting.
Straight ahead and don't look back.
And don't stop until I tell you.
All right. Get it open.
I'll go up in front and cover the engine crew.
I always did want an engineer's watch.
What for?
They're never on time.
This wax is as hard as your head.
Ah, those cracks are sealed good enough.
Give me the chisel.
This'll put us right back on the plush.
You still got McQueen to take care of.
Yeah.
Now, what are you waiting for?
Now's your chance while he's up there
Covering the engine crew.
Trouble is, he might not have his back turned.
Yeah, I knew you never had the guts
To shoot it out with him.
I could cut this car loose, leave him up there.
Reno, you do have a brain.
With this car loose,
It'll take a mile for the engine to stop.
That'd leave McQueen stranded
Where the marshal could pot him easy.
Go pull the pin.
The big country boy's on his way.
The only thing he'll get
Is the engineer's watch.
Gimme that fuse.
Well, don't blow yourself through the roof.
Say, did you look on top of this car?
RENO:
What for?
DUKE:
He might have doubled back on you.
Don't judge his brain by yours.
[EXPLOSION]
I knew he wasn't up there.
Now, we'll deal Pluthner out.
Let old man Rickard die in the poorhouse.
Yeah. Give your girl back to the Indians.
[BOTH LAUGHING]
Heist 'em!
Keep 'em up.
You and Pluthner had everything rigged pretty, didn't you?
On your feet.
[GUNS DROP]
Here. Put these on.
Now, hook them to him.
[HANDCUFFS LOCK]
No, to his shank.
Now, get over there.
Come on.
Get on your feet.
We can't.
We're shackled.
MARSHAL:
Wallace!
Yeah.
Here's the other two.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Duke Harris
And Reno Blake.
They're guilty. They're guilty.
Look, marshal.
You don't want us.
We're small potatoes.
McQueen's the one with the price on him
And he's got the haul.
Yeah. Make it easy on us, We'll tell you where to grab him.
Go ahead.
He's headed...
Headed for old
Dave Rickard's house,
Just outside of Potrero.
[INDIANS CHANTING
IN FOREIGN DIALECT]
Wes, don't go in.
Those Indians singing mean trouble.
Robbing the dead, huh?
You didn't expect me?
No. I, uh... Well, sure
I expected you, Wes.
Don't look at me like that.
I know what you're thinking, but it ain't true.
Old Dave died natural.
Well, you got the stuff?
Was there any trouble?
A little.
The marshal picked up
Reno and Duke.
What?
Aw, that was a tough break.
They were good boys.
But that's the game for you.
All a part of the game.
You and me, Wes.
Just you and me left out of that fine parcel of men.
Of course, we end up with the money, you and me.
But that's how the cards fall.
Look, Pluthner,
This deck's had so much bottom dealing it's dog-eared.
Too many jokers turned up.
The bank ain't cashing.
You took your divvy out of the old man's poke.
The game's over, gumshoes.
Put your hands up and turn around.
Just keep looking in the mirror.
You'll see a coyote that just done himself out of 50,000.
Wes, what happened?
Pluthner.
He got me in the shoulder.
It's like I said.
I ain't never seen Wes McQueen.
Come on, let's cut up through the Canyon Del Sol.
[MUTTERING]
That's, uh... That's $765 for the well digging.
That leaves us over a $100 for winter feed.
Thanks to Chet Rogers.
I'll be needing some of that money, Pa.
Hm?
I'm leaving here, Pa.
You're what?
I got a letter from Carter Randolph today.
He wants me to come back.
Does he say anything in his letter
About getting married?
No. And I don't care if that's the way it's gotta be.
I'm going to him.
Not by a jug full, you ain't.
If I can't go one way
I'll go another.
But I'll get there.
You won't get...
[HORSE SNORTS]
FRED:
Who's there?
It's me, Winslow.
Well, what's the matter, son?
What's happened to you, Chet?
There was a shooting in town.
He got a slug in the shoulder.
It was an accident.
It was no accident.
And my name's not Chet Rogers.
I held up the Denver and Rio Grande.
I'm Wes McQueen.
[GASPS]
You don't have to take me in.
Sit down, son.
Colorado, this is Mr. Winslow and his daughter, Julie Ann.
Let's have a look.
FRED:
The bullet's in there, all right.
We ought to have a doctor.
He's got one.
Get me a sharp knife.
I got my veterinary kit.
Well, get it.
And boil some water.
Right away.
Colorado, you better hide those horses.
I told you I had a past to get done with.
I never figured it would end like this.
I had all figured different.
There's 100,000 in those bags.
I figured with a stake we could start a brand-new life,
Go anyplace you wanted.
You can't go anyplace.
Not now.
You've got to get well.
You mean it don't make any difference I'm Wes McQueen?
I knew it.
I knew I could count on you, Julie Ann.
Who's that girl?
Colorado?
She's all right.
She was in on the holdup.
Tomorrow she gets her share and goes her own way.
We'll put him in my room, Pa.
He'll be more comfortable.
Here. You got it out.
Go ahead.
You know what to do.
Give me the powder from one of those bullets.
[SKIN SIZZLING]
Where are you going?
Well, I'm not gonna let him lie there and die.
He's got to have a doctor.
I'm riding into Aztec.
You're gonna stay right where you're at.
Nobody's leaving the house.
FRED:
You do like she says, Julie Ann.
If he ain't better come morning,
I'll hitch up a team and drive to Aztec myself.
MARSHAL:
Hey, you, in there.
It's the marshal.
Then I'll be right out, marshal.
Just as soon as I get my britches on.
Oh, I rousted you out of the feathers.
Blessed little sleep a man get around here.
First a fella comes riding through hob-leather,
Bleeding like a stuck leech.
He's the one we're after.
Say...
Say, ain't...
Ain't you the one,
That we saw on the stage holdup?
Yeah. I thought
I recognized you.
Well, you're sure playing in hard luck, mister.
Two chances you've had at Wes McQueen.
FRED:
Wes McQueen?
MARSHAL:
That's right.
Which way was he heading?
FRED:
He was heading north
Like he had an antelope by the tail.
MARSHAL:
It's too bad you didn't know who he was.
You'd have been $20,000 richer.
The railroad's offered a reward too.
Get out of my way.
MARSHAL:
If you hear anything, get word to us in Aztec.
JULIE ANN:
Let me go!
Talk and I'll pull your tongue out.
Here. What's going on here?
JULIE ANN:
Take her off me.
Quit that. Quit that.
Hold her here, and I'll catch up with the marshal.
We'll he rich, Pa.
Twenty thousand dollars.
We can leave this horrible place.
You heard what the mars...
Shut up.
[GASPS]
Come on, Colorado, we're leaving.
You thought we was your friends.
I wish you could have gone without knowing different.
You've been a good friend,
Mr. Winslow.
Good luck, Wes.
What did Martha look like?
The girl you were dreaming about that night.
Well, she was pretty, all right.
Tall and willowy,
Turned-up nose that wrinkled when she laughed.
She had dimples too.
That's Julie Ann.
That's funny at that.
All the time I was planning to marry Julie Ann,
I knew it didn't make sense,
But there was something about her.
Just Martha's ghost,
I guess.
How'd you figure it out?
I'm a woman.
Duke Harris, Reno Blake, hung by order of district judge.
You see that the Territorial governor gets that.
And tell him the crows will be pecking at McQueen too
Before another 48 hours.
Curley, Jack, Grey Eyes, come here
You ride out to Indian Springs,
He might head up there.
Seeing that he's wounded, he'll need water.
You take your men and head down south end
To the Canyon of Death.
McQueen might take off for Mexico.
Grey Eyes,
You take a look around Todos Santos.
And now, remember, you men,
If you flush him, don't try to shoot it out with him.
He's quicker than a black-headed snake.
Just send up a smoke signal
And we'll spot it.
Yeah, it's a nice sight
For anybody with a train-robbing itch.
What is it, Wes?
We're going to get married.
Wes.
I bought this ring for...
Maybe you wouldn't wanna wear it.
I wouldn't care.
Oh, don't put it on now.
It's bad luck before you're married.
Who's afraid?
You won't be sorry, Wes.
I'll make you love me.
Maybe I did all along.
Maybe that's why
I let you stay here.
Maybe I had the real thing alongside of me all the time
And didn't even know it.
You're sure you're not a little blind?
I knew what I wanted.
Wes McQueen.
You don't aim very high.
I'll see if that
Padre is around.
Oh, children,
I'm so happy to see you
Back at Todos Santos.
We want you to marry us.
But I'm not a priest.
I'm only a brother.
I have no authority to perform such ceremonies.
But... But yourself told me once that
Aztec is not far away.
It is for us.
We don't wanna turn back.
Then go forward, my children.
Follow the trail over the pass,
Beyond the Canyon of Death.
It will lead you to Old Mexico.
There at Rosario
Is our mission.
A beautiful church.
See Father Estaben about getting married, huh?
And, uh, when you're happily married,
Pray sometimes for Todos Santos.
That it too may live again.
Thank you.
Bless you.
We'll hide out here for a couple of days, and then...
Then where, Wes?
Old Mexico.
Do you think you'd like it there?
I like it just hearing you talk about it.
We'll be safe there.
I'll send the old man's widow her share
And then we'll get a place all our own.
What kind of place, Wes?
You could hold your head up as good as anybody
Married to a farmer, couldn't you?
Whatever you wanna be.
It's what I want you to be.
As good as anybody.
This time, Wes, we can really bust out.
We're in the clear now.
We just head out over those mountains...
What is it, Wes?
What does it mean?
It means we're a couple of fools
In a dead village dreaming about something
That will probably never happen.
Wes.
What are you doing?
Fixing it so you can't follow me.
Bury the money, Colorado.
I don't want you caught with it.
[YELLS]
Hyah!
What do you wanna do?
Stay with me and get killed?
We got to split up till this blows over.
They'll take you.
They'll never take me.
I've seen all the jails
I'll ever see.
This time it'd mean the rope.
It's our only chance,
Colorado.
I'll head over the pass to Old Mexico.
I'll wait there for you,
I promise.
We'll meet at Rosario,
Do all the things we talked shout.
Goodbye, Colorado.
Wes.
[HORSES APPROACHING]
MARSHAL:
Good scouting, Grey Eyes.
You catch where he's running?
He take trail through pass to Mexico.
MARSHAL:
That's how we figured it.
Fan out and we'll corral him in the Canyon of Death.
First man spots him, give the signal, three shots.
Then we'll tighten the cinch on him.
[GUNSHOTS]
[GUNSHOTS]
GREY EYES:
He start for City of Moon.
No way out.
Move it.
There's only one way up there
And he's got it right under his guns.
MARSHAL:
Hey, McQueen!
You got no chance!
Come on down!
We don't want no shooting!
WES:
Come and get me.
MARSHAL:
We'll starve you out!
WES:
Go ahead.
I wonder if he's out of ammunition.
Let's see.
[BIRD'S WINGS BEATING]
[INDIANS CHANTING
IN FOREIGN DIALECT]
Eagle.
I don't know.
Do you think you could work your way up there
To the top of that rim?
MAN:
I never heard tell of nobody ever doing it.
Well, we'll take a try at it, anyway.
If we can get him to show himself,
We can take a shot at him.
What are you doing here?
Who are you?
I'm... I'm Wes McQueen's woman.
We got him trapped up there.
You the marshal?
I know where the money is.
You'll never find it.
Not unless I tell you.
Come here to bargain, huh?
Let him go and you can have it all.
Now, you've got to understand it's the law you're talking to.
It don't make bargains.
Then you won't get him.
Well, I might willing to go a little ways with you.
You get your man to come down here and we won't shoot.
What would you do?
Hang him instead?
I'm offering you the money instead of Wes.
McQueen.
Come down.
We got your woman here.
That's what you say.
He won't fall for that.
Start yelling, you.
Go on, or I'll cut you up.
Go ahead.
I won't call him out.
If he's gotta die, he'd want it this way.
MAN:
Take it easy.
All right, if that's the way you want it,
Let him die up there.
You don't wanna leave him up there.
Buzzards picking his bones clean.
Call him out and we'll split the 20,000 reward with you.
Long time ago, my people live here.
Me know way in City of Moon.
Go around mountain.
Come in back way on other side.
How far?
Long way. Ride horses.
Curley and Jack, you stay here and watch her.
We'll go around and get him.
Well, he wouldn't let us in the front door
So we'll go around the back door and get him.
You made it sound so good
I almost believed it myself, Grey Eyes.
Do you think she'll call him out?
Maybe so.
Anyway, Eagle's got the daylight for his target.
Now, if Curley and Jack do just like I told them,
This might work.
Get them up.
Both of you.
Higher!
You. Go over there and fetch me those two horses.
Keep your hands up.
Both of you.
Now, start walking and don't look back.
Wes!
Wes!
Colorado.
Wes, they're coming at you.
They found a back way.
[GUN COCKS]
COLORADO:
Come down, Wes!
Hurry, Wes!
I got horses!
[SCREAMING]
Don't.
Don't!
[BELL TOLLING]
Brother Tomas, who has brought this new to Todos Santos?
A happy couple who passed this way.

Kinda free with your powder, ain't ya?
Not when I'm aimin' at a moonshiner with four jugs slung over his shoulder.
Accordin' to the law, a man's got a right to tote his liquor... wherever it fits him best, inside or out.
And he ain't a moonshiner till he sells it and gets caught at it.
The way you talk up for these superstitious mountain people, you'd think that every third 'shiner is your nephew.
Well, I've been up here long enough for the government to know just where I stand.
And you better be careful potshottin' at these nephews whose uncle I ain't.
Hey, Charlie, come here!
Take a look at this!
I told you I got him.
Cow. Cow?
Yeah. Lamentin' cow.
Full udder and nobody to milk her.
Lamentin', huh?
Snakes.
Get these hid away from here.
Let Wash do it.
Do what you're told.
Jim Lane's standin' watch for us at Holler Ridge.
Let him find his own cover.
Get these things hid away.
Douse that fire. Watch that smoke.
Are you deef?
Revenuers!
Dump that mash and scatter till I call ya.
Who lives there?
Jim Lane and his daughter, Sammy.
Come in.
Andy!
Hello, Sammy.
You're lookin' fine.
How's everything with you, Jim?
Well, Andy, I can't complain.
You're here just in time.
We got a powerful lot of johnnycake and squirrel stew.
There's only one more plate, unless they wanna eat stew out of their hands.
No, thanks, Sammy.
We got business to attend to.
Well, are you satisfied?
So long, Jim.
Bye, Sammy.
Good-bye.
They hit me without no warnin'.
Easy. Easy, young'un.
Don't hurt out loud, Pappy.
Here. Careful.
The murderin' hounds.
I was right down at the fork of the creek.
Young Matt givin' you sorghum beer for spottin' revenuers... while he's totin' his corn whiskey down into town!
Someday I'll...
Don't aggravate yourself.
It's me is shot.
'Tain't like it was Young Matt's fault.
Yeah!
It's you that's shot, just like you said.
Not him!
Come in.
What do you want?
My name's Daniel Howitt. I...
Don't you touch him!
This looks bad.
It's stopped bein' bad and turned worse.
I can take care of him.
That bullet's still with him.
I said I can take care of him.
I got salve.
I got cobwebs...
This is no time to argue!
Boil some water and get some clean rags.
When do you aim to take him?
Take him?
You're just wellin' him to take him to jail, ain't you?
I've been tryin' to tell ya.
I'm Daniel Howitt.
I came here to get some information, to get acquainted.
Why?
Well, I'd like to buy a piece of land, settle down here.
Why?
I... gonies! The man was right clever with me, and you act like he was a fine-hair.
Folks like him don't come to land what's been corned out.
Land with seed ticks and chinch bugs and whoopin' cough and...
Why'd you come?
I didn't ask you how he got shot.
No, you didn't, for a fact.
Evenin', brother.
Hello, Sammy.
Keep joggin', Young Matt.
Don't get off that horse!
Don't get your dander up.
I just come to see is your pa home.
He is, and we don't need you and your kind askin' after him.
I guess then I'll have to invite myself in.
Get on up the hill, Rowdy.
Tell Aunt Mollie
I want stack cakes... and roast yearlin'coon with plenty of gravy!
And tell her we ain't aimin' to stand for no more sickness and misery!
My, ain't the birds a... hollerin' pretty.
You and your devilment!
Aunt Mollie and Old Matt and their poison ways, makin' people scared of livin'!
There's bluebirds nestin' all over the mountain.
Liquor totin' and gettin' drunk and raisin'Jupiter to suit yourselves!
Your eyes are cussin' pretty tonight.
Makin' the hants do your biddin'!
Givin' the sick a soon start to die, makin' the well dark-eyed and fearful.
Why can't your dead mother keep her unhappiness in her grave?
Leave my mother be.
Oh, Matt, why do you keep doin' it?
All the way up the trail he bled.
What are you talkin' about?
They shot him, Matt.
Did they...
I'm all right.
What happened?
I was drinkin' when
I should've been watchin'.
Andy Beeler?
Yeah.
And two new ones with him.
Looks like... he'll never learn.
Well, they're startin' somethin' they better know how to finish.
Who's he?
My name's Daniel Howitt.
What's he here for?
He's my cousin.
Now, that isn't...
This here's young Matt Mathews.
Mr. Howitt says he's gonna live here.
That's right. I plan to stay here.
It ain't likely for strangers... to find these parts to settle down in.
I brought along some good fishing tackle.
We might give 'em a try when the weather's right.
Let me know can I do anything for ya, Jim.
Even Sammy's sayin' it now, Ma.
All the lies they teached her.
Blamin' us for all their ails and sufferin'.
You for all the unseen things
God lets be.
Me for the fightin' and meanness.
Well, maybe they're right about me, but you...
I'll stop 'em.
Some one of these days I'll find him, him that... never came back to ya.
Do you suppose the Mathews would sell me some of their land?
Might... if you was that crazy.
They got money cramps.
But don't let 'em sell ya
Moanin' Meadow.
Moanin' Meadow?
That's where the hant comes from.
Frogs as quiet as grave rocks, and the light comin' from nowhere.
The trees don't rustle, and the flowers grow big, but they don't have pretty smells.
Bad land, like everything has got the name of Mathews is bad, exceptin'—
'Ceptin' Young Matt!
He ain't naturally bad.
Them's the ones that makes him so.
Them?
Them as won't let the dead rest!
His uncle, Old Matt, with his fire-spittin' tongue.
That old she-devil crow, Aunt Mollie.
And Pete, without no brains and no hope.
All of'em makin' Matt a sick soul, raisin' him to murder, to murder his pa who run off and left him.
And all of'em guilting her, she who never done no hurt to no one of God's critters.
She?
His mother.
Coot.
It's Coot Royal.
The baby.
Yeah.
She's needin' some elm bark tea.
Poor young'un can't hardly breathe.
She... She's near dyin'.
I... gonies!
No, you don't, Pappy.
You stay here. You're too gaunted.
I'll go with her.
It's just a trot and gallop down the trail.
I knowed it.
I knowed it when I heared the fox bark in the night... and my voice growed damp when I prayed.
Sammy.
Get a clean rag and a little stick.
Fix me a swab, Sammy.
She's done it!
She's sent the hex on us!
It's me done it, Granny Lady,
'cause I ain't never been no good.
The sorriest critter on the creek, with things always windin' out black for me... and nothin' to give ya but poke sallet and no-good hog mollies.
You've given me more than that!
You always call me "lady."
And I can sit here and rest myself in a milk-white castle.
It's her in Moanin' Meadow that walks through the night, touchin' nothing but layin' her hand on all.
It's them darn Mathews on the knob.
It's him, the spittin' snake that never come back to claim his own wood's colt!
It's him!
The stranger, Coot, he brung her back to us like a good shepherd.
Your little girl was choked up and became unconscious.
Just keep her throat clear and keep her wrapped up warm, and she'll be all right tonight.
By tomorrow, she'll be beggin' to wade the creek and askin' what makes the sky blue, won't ya?
Your daddy will be gettin' anxious, won't he, Sammy?
Stranger?
Did you ever get to feel how good mud is?
No, but I wish I had.
I almost stepped on a cloud.
Morning, and howdy to ya, Sammy!
Same to you, Kip.
Wife mendin'?
Fine. She's talkin' like a windmill.
Goggle-eyes!
Yeah. Catched 'em down by the ol' Beany.
Grasshopper bait?
No. Noodlin'!
Yeah?
Hello, Mrs. Schulz. How's the baby?
Just fine, Sammy.
Wait, Sammy.
I wanna go in the store.
We might need more money when we get up to Mathews'.
Corky? He won't lend you no money.
He won't even let you look at none.
I don't want to borrow any money.
I only want to cash a check.
A check?
Yeah. A check is a piece of paper, a note.
Like a mortgage?
Well, no, not... not exactly.
A check is a... A check is an exchange.
You mean, like a swap.
Well, uh, yes, in a way.
You see, a check is...
A check is a letter, a letter to the bank where I have my money, tellin' them to... to pay cash to whoever has that letter.
Is it honest?
Yes, if you have the money in the bank.
All right,
I'd like to see you do it.
Hello, Hank!
Hello, Sammy.
Let's see,
Mrs. Palestrom.
Hello, Mrs. Kundy.
I got Coleby's Cholera Tincture,
Miss Wassop's Soothing Syrup,
Kittredge's Salve and Wahoo Tonic.
Could be she might be needin' worm cakes.
Nope, 'tain't that.
I put a dried tater chip and two crawdad legs in her bed, but she's still got that seldom feelin', complainin' from head to heel.
How much is them?
I'm gettin' tired of soakin' sugar s-s-sops.
Better do somethin' about that neck rash you got there.
'Tain't rash. It's the dye from off my shirt.
I didn't souse it enough in lye water.
You oughta see our young'uns— just like a passel of pure redskins.
Them's 30 cents.
The mouthpiece is for nothin'.
Thirty cents!
Howdy, Sammy.
Been wantin' to meet your cousin.
Hello, Mr. Howitt.
How do you do, sir?
He wants to cash a check... one of them letters to where he's got money in the bank.
How much do you reckon to want, Mr. Howitt?
Well, if it's convenient,
I could use a hundred dollars.
You could use a hundred dollars?
Yes, if it's convenient.
Well, uh...
I have letters of identification here.
Well, uh, Sammy's say - so is all right with me.
I... I'll look around.
Smart.
Twenty-five, 30, 35, 40.
Forty-five.
It's Confederate.
Forty will do me fine.
I didn't dig into my real reserves.
They ain't here.
There you are, sir.
Thank you very much.
Look out, Al.
You know about them city telephone machines for talkin'?
Yeah.
What about 'em?
Seems foolish to me.
Ain't nobody in the Ozarks don't know you got a hundred dollars right now.
Remember now, you keep shut.
I'll do the talkin'.
Anything you say, Sammy.
It ain't gonna be so pleasant, on account of Aunt Mollie, it ain't.
She always looks at ya like a sheep-killin' dog.
How 'bout Old Matt?
Oh, him?
When he finds out you got a hundred dollars, his eyes will get bigger than buckets of hog lard.
Don't open it.
They'll shoot ya clean back to the valley.
Hello!
Hello, there!
He ain't totin' no gun.
Come on.
I told you afore you ain't wanted here.
Where's your woman?
Down by the hog scald.
So you're the cousin, eh?
What do you want?
He wants to buy some dirt land.
Go on in.
I'll fetch my woman.
While I worry him, you head for the house.
He's ornery, just like them he watches for.
He ain't educated to city talk.
You gotta twist him around a pole or somethin' to get what you want.
You see?
Yes, I do.
Friends, Pete.
Won't nobody hurt ya.
That's Pete.
He ain't right.
Pete? Mollie and Old Matt's boy.
Young Matt's cousin.
Well, pretty near it.
Aunt Mollie, this is Mr. Howitt.
Strangers ain't wanted.
What brung you here?
He wants to buy some Mathews land.
He's my cousin.
He's got a hundred dollars.
Shucks.
For a hundred dollars, we can let you have that finger of land down by the twisted sassafras.
No?
No!
If it's a question of more money,
Mrs. Mathews,
I'd be glad to give you a hundred dollars cash and something each month.
We got them uplands on the sun side.
Ain't been brushed off yet.
But if you're lookin' for...
He ain't!
I'd like to buy Moanin' Meadow.
Shut up!
Not for no hundred dollars.
No.
It'd take more money than you'd ever have.
It'd take a thousand dollars.
All right, I'll pay a thousand dollars, if you'll allow me to give you the hundred dollars now... and $75 a month until the thousand is paid.
You'll pay... a thousand dollars?
Yes.
Have you pen and paper?
You unbounded your word and spoke.
That's what ya done.
A hundred dollars and promised more.
You made a swap with a bad tangle in it.
Smell.
Besides which, on account of you disobeyin' me, you bought an unhappy land.
Well, you see, Sammy...
Moanin' Meadow. Won't nobody come to pay you company there... nor warm by your fire with ya.
Well, it might be that unhappy land, like unhappy people, needs someone to care for it.
I beg the good omens I've had through the week to counter the spell of the spirits... who seek to dampen the wishes
I've knotted in yarn or darken the luck of pulley-bone's charm.
One and one is two, and three add to five.
Dead spirits stay dead and live ones alive.
Listen, Sammy...
See that buck brush, Mr. Howitt?
Well, up past it into them chinkapins, then you travel up the steep hill, down past the deer lick into them low, big gaps.
That's Moanin' Meadow.
Good-bye, Mr. Howitt.
Sammy, there's no sense to all this.
I'm tellin' you for the last and final time, them that goes in there has daylight dreams and always disremembers.
And there's poison plants and poke berries and nightshades dancin' with the bats.
Good-bye, Mr. Howitt.
That snag in your shoulder ailin'?
Not any.
It's just that from the time I was shucked out of knee britches,
I ain't been so crowded 'round with notions.
I brung ya a brand-new kiss for luck.
Restin' up from devilment?
Nope. Just committed some.
Brung you that lace neckpiece for your throat.
These pants is got thorns in 'em.
Like you was sayin', Jim, a blue-eyed filly is the most worrisome kind to gentle.
- What?
- No mind what you do, you never get a friendly whicker out of'em.
Well, the last I recollect, we was speakin' of notions.
That's what I mean.
You get to whisperin' to yourself... when there ain't a single word to say.
Bees bumblin' at ya, you get all tongue-tied, start smilin'sidewise.
And you see plumb fancy with your eyes shut tight.
Feelin' that way, a man most generally falls off to sleep.
I... It don't make a speck of sense.
Oh, it 'tain't the sleepin' or the talkin' back and forth in your dreams.
It's... It's the wakin' up and findin' out... you been dreamin' to suit yourself.
Well, it's just like you been sayin' and I been wonderin'.
The heavier the man, the deeper his boot track.
It just don't make no sense, love don't.
But there it is.
Well, I guess supper's coolin' and waitin' at our house.
Bye, Jim.
Bye.
Bye, Sammy.
"I've been sayin', and he's been wonderin'."
What in thunderation was he talkin' about?
Somethin' inside you gets to hurtin', you're breathin' so awful bad, you wanna yell out loud.
And you know you're walkin' up a road ain't got no end.
For the sake of my tired soul's confusion, what are you aimin' at?
He's been talkin' pretty words fenced around with no meanin'.
'Cause love don't make no sense, it don't, not when a man's got on his mind what Young Matt's sworn to do.
Uh-huh!
Smelled that peppermint candy all the way up here, didn't ya?
Here, Pete.
Something's wrong.
Something's wrong around here.
What is it?
Everything's as usual, and better.
Set and eat.
What's he tryin' to say?
What you been wantin' most to do,
Matt? What are you gettin' at?
Look.
A hundred dollars, and more to come.
Your waitin's over, Matt.
You sold Moanin' Meadow.
For your sake.
Look! Hatin', hatin'.
You sold it, and you got no right!
She's my sister same as she's your mother.
Only she has got a right to be in Moanin' Meadow.
Go on!
But before you do it, you gotta know this.
It's me runnin' the Mathews, and not you whose bornin' brung the misery on us.
I know what I am.
Then don't be forgettin' why us are livin' on the hill, hidin' from folks' laughin' and talkin'.
Don't no one ask us to no get-togethers.
They don't want nothin' to do with no kinfolk of your mother's.
No stranger's gonna trample on her grave.
You can't rest her easy by killin' strangers.
Kill him what put the idiot curse on my son.
Him what killed her, not the one that's gonna give you the money to do it.
Poison talk.
You witch-woman you.
You... with your sermon of hate.
Castin'a spell onto all of us!
A... drivin' Young Matt to murder.
You fool! You blind-drunk fool!
You're right. You're right.
I sat there sayin' to myself,
"Why don't ya stop him?
'Cause you can't.
"'Cause why? 'Cause you ain't got the backbone of a fishworm. That's why.
And once more, you're tromped down!"
Ah, I "seed" it... the night she lay dyin' over in her cabin... and alone.
Yeah, I told you I was down to the forks, but I seed it with my own eyes.
You were full of the devil's sin, and it was a-stormin'.
And little Pete went out to help, and you followed him and drove him out of the cabin.
A lightnin' tree felled him and took away his senses.
You lie! You lie!
And she looked at you afore she died, didn't she?
Didn't she?
No!
Yes!
And anyone that looks at a dyin' body's face will be the next one to die!
So you put your Satan's sin and filled Young Matt with it.
Heh! "Counter the curse... by killing the one that wronged her."
And all this I knowed and seed with my own eyes... and held it inside me.
I done that for you, Mollie,
'cause you're mine.
I gotta ask you to get off of this place, Mr. Howitt.
But I bought this place.
It ain't for sale.
You'll get your money back.
Look, Matt, this place is mine.
I don't wanna hurt no kinfolk of Sammy's.
You won't be. I'm not Sammy's cousin.
She just said that to protect me.
Well, then get off of here and get off quick.
Look, Matt, I bought this place.
And among honest people, a trade is a trade.
Let me borrow that gun, Matt.
Some folks ain't to be trusted with a loaded gun.
Remember what I said.
I'll be lookin' to see you gone.
It'd be bad luck to start up housekeepin' without some salt, bread... and a sweepin' broom.
Thanks.
It's the right notion, Sammy.
With the way things are in our mountains now, it needs more than salt and bread and a sweepin' broom.
Can't hardly believe it myself.
But it wasn't always that way.
No, they wasn't.
Folks was happy. They sung songs.
They worked.
Now all they do is set around and try to outsmart the government.
Seems like people nowadays are stagnatin'... and filming over like a... like a pond dryin' up.
Maybe there's a way of goin' ahead by getting back to where you were.
Maybe if we four begin it... help to lift the burden... others'll come to help.
You know how I feel about it.
You can count on me.
Well, seein' as how we're all of one mind, let me unpack you from Moanin' Meadow.
That's home, Sammy.
But you folks come and see me.
You can have a fence full of open gates
'round Moanin' Meadow.
You'll never be crowded for company.
Come on, help me.
Andy.
Here, I'll take that.
Why, I almost forgot.
I bought you that.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Must be the Lord marks folks... to favor a purpose.
One and one is two, and three goes to five.
Dead spirits stay dead and live ones alive.
One and one is two and three goes to five.
Dead spirits stay dead and live ones alive.
Sammy, it's good to see you here.
Come in.
Sit down, Sammy.
I can't sit, and I can't stop shakin'.
I couldn't sleep a wink.
I can't stop the feelin' inside me.
Past and present go together.
I knowed it from the first.
You and Young Matt — son and pappy.
Him and your eyes, and you and his.
And the way his mouth laughs when he don't want it to.
I'm glad you know.
Sit down, Sammy.
Someday, he's gonna look good at you and see himself lookin' back at him from outta your eyes.
Someday, he's certain bound to know.
Someday, he is certain bound to know.
I'm gonna tell him.
He swore a blood oath to kill ya when he finds ya.
Listen, Sammy. He's my son.
If dyin' for him would help, that would be easy.
But I know that if he kills me, he loses himself... and you.
It would mean just one more generation of misery.
I know what it means to go through life empty and alone.
I won't let him do that.
I don't know how and I don't know when, Sammy, but I will find a way to tell him.
I must find a way to help him unswear his blood oath.
Before, it was just some worthless man that Matt always hated.
Now it's you.
Wash, take this.
I got somebody I wanna see.
That sums up to $4.00, Corky.
Reckon I'll have to ask you to pass me by this time.
Overstocked.
I'm waitin', Corky.
And waitin'aggravates me.
Can't blame me, Wash.
Ain't nothin' I can do about it if folks have changed and... and lost their appetite for thirstin'.
These hills don't change for nobody.
And there's some people around here that are overdue to learn that.
It's hindsight — changin'old friends for new.
Corky, if you can't sell that to nobody else, you sold it to yourself.
I reckon I just temporarily lost my manners.
Yeah.
Been tryin' to figure out what it was I liked about you.
Come to find out it's the easy style you unload a full-up wagon.
Hello, Matt.
What are you doin' down here?
Get outta there!
He's working for me, Wash.
He's helping me with the sheep.
Workin'?
For you?
You get on up the trail.
Get up the trail, I told ya!
Pick him up, Wash.
Me? That idiot?
Pick him up!
Pick him up yourself.
Shoo, boy!
Oh, I didn't mean to hurt you none.
Thanks.
Let's go home.
Come on, Pete.
It's a funny thing about him.
As far as I can remember back, he's either fightin' agin ya or he's fightin' for ya.
Ain't nobody got a right to Moanin' Meadow.
My mother's buried there.
It's hers.
I told him it was an unhappy land.
All he said was, "Maybe it just needs a- carin' for, like unhappy folks."
He didn't ask me who shot Pappy.
He just went ahead a-helpin' him.
And Coot's baby.
Ever since he's been here, he's been actin'just like a good shepherd.
Even when he talks about liquor drinkin', he makes it sound more right than why we shouldn't do it.
Well, it ain't him.
It's Moanin' Meadow I'm talkin' about.
If he cares for Moanin' Meadow like he says and like he cares for folks, then he'll be a-helpin'.
Like what he's done for Granny Becky.
Sent her off to a city doctor.
Her blind-born eyes are gonna be fixed so she can see out of'em.
He did that?
He did! 'Cause there ain't no bad in him.
There ain't nothin' but good!
Ah, Matt, let him stay.
Well, maybe.
I've been expecting you, Matt.
I come to ask are you still of a mind to go fishin'.
- If you say so.
- The weather's right... now.
You know, there's a funny thing about fishin'.
You can let your thoughts drift downstream... till they carry your troubles clean outta sight.
Yep.
If I had me fins where I got legs,
I'd paddle me away from troubles... instead of wadin' knee-deep to meet 'em.
There's things come natural with mountain learnin', things I might could show you.
But... what I'm needin' now takes a... man with city knowin' to tell me.
I'd like to help you, Matt. Can I?
Might be you could.
Say somebody was... lost from ya... somebody you had to find, somebody you was in debt to kill.
We got a curse on us, we Mathews folks.
A curse as old as... me.
There ain't no rest for us, livin'or dead.
Not till I find him who marked me for what I am and... aged my mother too young for her grave.
Matt, what would it be like, as long as you live, having to remember that you stopped a man's life?
Whole days when... you couldn't forget.
Nights when you have to face yourself... and him alone.
Nights when... when you just pray for the comin' of daylight.
You think I wanna do it, that it pleases me to think about it?
I saw a fella kill a man once, when I wasn't half growed.
But I stood up to it and looked,
'cause I knowed that's what I was born to do.
But there's Sammy to think of.
Sammy loves you, Matt.
Sammy?
I got no right... to love nor marry.
I gotta forget thinkin' about Sammy.
We'll find him, Matt. I promise you.
Dan Howitt he calls his name.
Settin' hisself up as shepherd of the hills.
We don't need no shepherdin'.
We ain't allowin' no stranger to come in and hide among us... and turn our mountain folk away from their learnin'!
Makin' and drinkin' honest corn liquor is blessed of old.
It's our livin'!
Already we been left shorthanded at the stills... and are gettin' closer to where nobody'll buy or drink our makin's!
A... spreadin' his reach into the family.
If somebody's come to see us, they're bad off to go a place.
I'm gettin' educated.
You was being spoke of, Mr. Howitt.
Come on in, if you're a mind to.
I knew you'd be expectin' me.
Payment on Moanin' Meadow.
Money's a thing hands can't dirty.
I brought you a message, too, an invitation.
You can take it back where you brung it from.
Granny Becky's back from her operation.
They're removin' the bandages tomorrow — havin' what Coot calls "an unveilin"' at Flying Clouds Bluff.
Becky was born blind.
She ain't never gonna see
'less she's born again.
She especially wanted her cousin
Mollie Mathews to be at her first seein'.
Shut up shoutin'.
There's to be an all-day singin' and dinner on the grass.
Promise to take me with you, Pete?
Let 'em gather.
Let Becky see.
Let 'em sing.
You'll be missed if you're not there.
Oh, I almost forgot you, Pete.
You earned it... and more.
Why, that's twice as much as any two of us earned last month.
Here she comes.
You gotta get ready now, Ma.
I'm ready.
Thank you, God.
The first tear I ever seen.
A mighty pretty thing for human gladness.
I'm a-seein'!
I'm a witness to the color of God's good dirt.
I was savin' you, child, till these old eyes got used to seeing pretty things.
Howdy, Granny Becky.
You and your chairs.
A-rockin' me to seein' all over the place.
You mind speakin' to me?
Hello, Granny Becky.
You're Corky!
Yeah.
And me a-thinkin' you was a sawed-off little one.
You're Mollie Mathews, my blood cousin.
I asked a-purpose to have you here...
'cause I recollect you had a gift for love and kindness... when you was a girl.
Now there's a devil in ya.
Your soul's et up with hate.
You meddlin' old fool.
We hadn't oughta come, like I told ya.
I'm...
Sammy Lane!
Well, bless the sight of you, child!
And...
Who is he?
Him? You know him.
That's young Matt Mathews.
Then I'm as blind as ever I was.
He's no Mathews, no more than he's a poisoned Baldknobber.
No, Sammy. He's kin to his image.
Son of his father, if I can see at all.
That's Mr. Howitt.
Don't, Matt. She told you the truth.
He was gonna tell you hisself!
Get his rifle, Pete.
Stay where you are, Matt.
And leave your rifle restin' where it's at.
Throw it away!
Stop, you poor fool!
Let go, Pete! Let go!
I wish I'd stayed stone-blind... in the good, clean dark.
What's done is done.
We'll go home.
He done it! He done it!
If Pete dies, it's 'cause you all are standin' around here mournin' womanlike... instead of sheddin' the blood that laid the curse on the Mathews from her day to this!
I guess...
I'm the only one to... end the curse.
Don't. Please, don't, Matt.
I've been waitin' and prayin' to stop ya.
You gotta turn back— turn back from killin'.
Get out of the way, Sammy. Go home.
If you go, it's all ended between us, all the feelin's and hopes.
There never was... no hopes between us.
Don't.
Don't, Matt.
Matt.
Young Matt.
I got some words saved to tell ya.
Pete!
Pete. Son.
Ma.
I can remember... when you had gentlelike ways... till the lightning tree... took away my speakin'.
It... It made you die... inside.
It's you... who's the curse.
Leave me alone with my baby.
Please.
Mollie!
Mollie!
I've tended him to the best of my knowledge.
Hurt like Matt is, a man's got to have the will to live, something he'd— he'd die for, to bring him back to livin'!
The will to live.
Something to die for.
He can't be blamed for bein'learned to see and fight for the wrong things.
I know, Sammy.
Why can't he live and see things good and clean... and know that folks love him?
I watched him comin'down that meadow... and I saw myself 25 years ago... with nobody there to stop me from makin'that mistake.
I killed a man.
I've been servin'a prison term.
That's why I never knew
Sarah was dying, why I couldn't come back.
And I didn't want Matt to spend his life in prison for the same thing.
I'd rather see him dead.
That's why I shot him... first.
Ever since I... got able to remember,
I've been sproutin' and... growin' too fast outta my britches.
I reckon I never growed any inside... till today.
It's kinda like... being borned all over again... right side up.
I ain't lost from nobody no more.
Matt.
Tell her I got a marrying notion... if she'll ask me real nice.
I'd admire to.
Say, buddy, will you stake a fellow...
Hey, mister, will you stake a fellow American to a meal?
- State lottery, señor?
- Beat it. I ain't buying no lottery tickets.
4,000 pesos is the big prize.
Get away from me, you little beggar.
The whole ticket is only 4 pesos.
It's a sure winner.
I ain't got 4 pesos.
Buy a quarter of a ticket for 1 peso silver.
If you don't get away from me,
I'll throw this water right in your face.
Then one tenth of a ticket, señor, for 40...
Señor, buy one twentieth.
One twentieth costs you only 20 centavos.
Look, señor, add the figures up.
You get 13.
What better number could you buy?
It's a sure winner.
- Yeah, how soon's the drawing?
- Only three weeks off.
Give me a twentieth so I don't have to look at your ugly face.
Come again next time.
I always have the winners, all the lucky numbers. Good luck.
Thirteen.
Excuse me.
Cigarette?
Thanks.
- It's hot.
- Yeah.
What a town, Tampico.
You said it, brother.
If I could get a job that'd bring enough to buy passage...
I'd shake its dust off my feet soon enough, you bet.
If I was a native,
I'd get a can of shoe polish... and I'd be in business.
They'd never let a gringo.
You can sit on a bench till you're three-quarters starved.
You can beg from another gringo, or even commit burglary.
You try shining shoes in the street... or peddling lemonade out of a bucket and your hash is settled.
You'll never get another job from an American.
Yeah, and the natives would hound and pester you to death.
- Some town to be broke in.
- What town isn't?
Can you stake a fellow American to a meal?
Hey, mister.
Will you stake a fellow American to a meal?
Such impudence never came my way.
Early this afternoon, I gave you money.
When my shoes were being polished,
I gave you more.
Now you put the bite on me again.
Do me a favor.
Go occasionally to somebody else.
- It's beginning to get tiresome.
- Excuse me. I didn't know it was you.
I never looked at your face, just your hands and the money you gave me.
Beg pardon. I promise
I'll never put the bite on you again.
This is the very last you get from me.
Just to make sure you don't forget your promise, here's another peso.
- Thanks, mister.
- But from now on... you have to make your way through life without my assistance.
Hey, buddy, will you stake a fellow American to a meal?
I won't give you a red cent.
If you want to make some money
I'll give you a job.
- What's the catch?
- There's no catch.
I got a job if you want.
It's hard work, but good pay.
- Did you ever rig a camp?
- Sure.
The ferry's making off, one of my men hasn't shown up.
I don't know what's happened to him.
He's probably drunk in some dive.
- What's the pay?
- $8 a day.
Don't just stand there.
Make up your mind, the ferry doesn't wait.
- I'm your man.
- Come on.
- Hello, there.
- Hello, yourself.
Okay, you guys, get aboard.
Take it your way.
What's the matter with you two?
Can't you take it?
It's 130 in the shade, and there ain't any shade up there on that derrick.
Just figure you're a couple of millionaires in your own private steam bath.
And the sooner we're through... the sooner we'll be back in town drinking cold beer.
We finish within two weeks,
I'm giving you fellas a bonus.
Yeah, it's coming to us working 16, 18 hours a day like we do.
Don't go crying to your mamas.
What do you want?
I'm paying top salaries and a bonus.
What about our pay anyway, and when do we get it?
- I ain't seen a buck out of you yet.
- You'll get your dough, all right... don't worry about that, when we get back to Tampico.
What could you do with money out here anyway, except gamble and lose it?
You'll be paid as we step off the ferry.
The agent was supposed to be here with the dough.
Don't know what could've happened.
But don't worry.
I'll go to the office and pick up the money.
You men stay here.
Any objection to a couple of us coming with you?
Don't you trust me?
You think I'd run out on you?
I don't think you'd do that.
But I ain't got a cent, not even enough to buy me a glass of beer.
Say, you two guys meet me over at the Cantina Madrid.
It's 2:15 now and I'll be over there no later than 3:00.
Pat McCormick.
He comes here from time to time.
I haven't seen him lately.
Pat McCormick?
What about Pat McCormick?
- He's supposed to meet us here.
- Does he owe you any money?
Say, how long you guys been around Tampico, anyway?
What's that got to do with it?
Only foreigners and half-baked Americans fall for McCormick's tricks.
How do you mean?
I mean, he hires dumb guys like you to work for him.
When it comes time to pay off, he takes a powder.
How much we got left of that $10 he gave us, Dobbsie?
- That's not even enough for one bed.
I know a joint that's full of rats, scorpions and cockroaches.
The cots are only 50 centavos a night.
Have another...
...jobs that were a dime a dozen ain't to be had at all.
Streets are full of guys... pushing each other over a meal.
Gold in Mexico? Sure there is.
Not 10 days from here by rail.
The mountain's waiting for the right guy to discover and take her treasure.
The question is: Are you the right guy?
Real bonanzas are few and far between.
They take a lot of finding.
Answer me this, will you?
Why is gold worth some $20 an ounce?
- I don't know. Because it's scarce.
- A thousand men go searching for gold.
After six months one of them's lucky.
One out of the thousand.
His find represents not only his own labor but that of 999 others to boot.
That's 6,000 months, 500 years... scrambling over mountain, going hungry and thirsty.
The gold is worth what it is 'cause of the human labor that went into finding it.
- Never thought of it like that.
- There's no other explanation.
Gold ain't good for nothing except for making jewelry and gold teeth.
Gold's a devilish sort of thing.
You start out to tell yourself you'll be satisfied with $25,000 worth.
So help me Lord and cross my heart.
Fine resolution.
After months of sweating yourself dizzy, few provisions, finding nothing... you finally come down to $15,000, then $10,000.
Finally you say,
"Lord, let me just find $5,000 worth...
"and I'll never ask for anything more the rest of my life."
$5,000 is a lot of money.
In this joint it seems like a lot.
But if you made a real strike, you couldn't be dragged away.
Even the threat of death wouldn't keep you from adding $10,000 more.
$10,000, you'd want $25,000.
$25,000, you'd want $50,000.
$50,000, $100,000. Like roulette.
One more turn, you know.
Always one more.
It wouldn't be that way with me.
I swear, it wouldn't.
I'd take only what I set out to get.
Even if there was still $500,000 worth... lying around, waiting to be picked up.
I've dug in Alaska and Canada and Colorado.
I was in the British Honduras,
I made my fare back home... and almost enough over to cure me of the fever I'd caught.
Dug in California and Australia.
All over the world practically.
Yeah. I know what gold does to men's souls.
You talk as though you struck it rich sometime or other, pop.
How about it?
Then what are you doing in here, a down-and-outer?
That's gold. That's what it makes us.
Never knew a prospector yet that died rich.
Make one fortune, he's sure to blow it trying to find another.
I'm no exception to the rule.
Sure I'm a gnawed old bone now but don't you guys think the spirit's gone.
I'm set to shoulder a pickaxe if anybody's willing to share expenses.
I'd rather go by myself.
It's best to go alone.
But you got to have a stomach for loneliness. Some guys go nutty with it.
But going with a partner is dangerous.
Murder is always lurking about.
Partners accusing each other of all sorts of crimes.
As long as there's no find, the noble brotherhood will last.
But when the piles of gold begin to grow, that's when the trouble starts.
I wouldn't mind a little of that kind of trouble.
I think I'll go to sleep... and dream about piles of gold... getting bigger and bigger.
Do you believe what the old man... who was doing all the talking at the Oso Negro... said the other night... about gold changing a man's soul so that he ain't the same kind of a guy... that he was before finding it?
Guess that all depends on the man.
That's exactly what I say.
Gold don't carry any curse with it.
It all depends on whether or not the guy who finds it is the right guy.
The way I see it... gold can be as much of a blessing as a curse.
Look who's coming out of the Hotel Bristol.
Is that Pat McCormick or am I seeing things?
It's him.
- Let's get him.
- Let's get him hard.
Why don't you and me go and buy me something?
I could use a new pair of shoes.
Hello, fellows, how are you?
Glad to see you.
- Mr. Dobbs and Mr. Curtin, Señorita...
- López.
López. I want you guys to come and have a drink with me.
I've got business to attend to with these men.
You go back up the hotel and wait.
I won't be long.
Okay.
Fellas, let's have that drink.
Where have you been?
I've been looking all over for you.
Three shots of rye.
Make mine brandy, Three Star.
- Two brandies.
- Rye is good enough for me.
I suppose you're wondering about that money that's coming to you.
The fact is I haven't been paid off on that contract myself.
If I had the money, you'd get it first thing.
I'll put you both on my next contract.
It will come through by Monday and we can set out Friday.
Here's mud in your eye.
We want what's coming to us.
We want it right here and now.
- But didn't I just tell you...
- You better come across.
I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll give you 25º% .
I guess I can make it 30º% .
And the balance, say, the middle of next week?
Nothing doing. Right here and now.
Every cent or you won't walk out of here.
You'll be carried out.
Let's don't stop being friends.
How about another drink?
Two more brandies.
Put the bottle on the bar.
If you want to get us liquored up...
No, I'm just inviting you to have a friendly drink with me.
- I'm licked, boys.
- Give us our money.
Yeah, give us our money.
I can't see.
- That's it, ain't it, Curt?
- Yeah, that's it.
Let's beat it before the law arrives.
Here's for the drinks and the use of the cantina.
- You know something, Curt?
- What?
We ain't very smart, hanging around Tampico waiting for a job.
Money's getting shorter every day... and soon we'll be right back where we were, on the bum again... pushing guys for dimes, sleeping around in freight cars.
That's right. Got any ideas?
That old man in the Oso Negro started me to thinking.
What about?
Why not try gold-digging for a change?
It ain't any riskier than waiting around here for a break... and this is the country where the nuggets of gold are crying for you... to take them out of the ground, make them shinin' coins... on the fingers and necks of swell dames.
One thing, living in the open is cheaper than it is here in Tampico.
Our money'd last longer.
The longer it lasts, the greater our chance of digging something up would be.
We'd have to have equipment, all right.
Picks and spades, pans, burros.
Wonder how much it would all cost.
- That old man would know.
- Yeah, he could give us some pointers.
He's too old to take along.
We'd have to pack him on our backs.
You can't tell about some of those old guys.
It's surprising sometimes how tough they are.
I don't know what gold looks like in the ground.
I've only seen it in jewelry store windows and people's mouths.
You know anything about prospecting?
Not much when you come right down to it.
We might have real use for an experienced guy like that old-timer.
Let's go hunt him up right away.
Will I go? What a question.
Of course I'll go.
Any time, any day,
I was waiting for somebody to ask me.
Out for gold? I'm always at your service.
I got $300 ready cash in the bank.
$200 of it all set to invest.
Last money I got.
When it's gone, I'm finished.
If you don't take a risk, you can't make a gain.
How much dough you guys got to put in?
I've got $150 and Curtin's got the same.
$500 ain't hardly enough to buy tools, weapons and essential provisions.
What do we need weapons for?
Meat's one thing and bandits another.
Bandit country's where we'd be going.
We need $600 between us.
- That much?
- Can't you dig up any more?
Not a red cent.
Give me my money, señor!
10º% I get for selling the winning ticket.
Get away from me, will you?
Please, señor.
Whoever draws the lucky number... gives a present to the seller...
I don't want any lottery ticket!
If you don't, you have bad luck the rest of your life.
What? Wait a minute.
What did you first say?
Why, he's trying to tell you he sold you the winning ticket.
Hey, wait a minute.
This what you mean?
- You say it's the winner?
- 200 peso prize.
Where?
- That's my number.
- Sure enough.
Just look at that fat, rich, printed number.
That's the kind of sugar poppa likes.
200 pesos.
Welcome, sweet little smackeroos.
Here, son, here's a present for you with my blessing.
Would you like to shake the hand that bought that ticket?
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations, yourself.
You stand to profit out of this the same as I do.
How do you make that out?
Didn't he just say we needed $600?
That's what we've got now, ain't it?
- Yeah, but...
- But what?
- Why are you putting up for me?
- This is an all-or-nothing proposition.
If we make a find, we'll be lighting our cigars with $100 bills.
If not, the difference between what you and I put up... ain't enough to keep me from being where I was this afternoon:
Polishing a bench with the seat of my pants.
Put her there, part.
We'll buy our burros at Perla and head northwest away from the railroad.
It's no use looking near a railroad... or any kind of a road at all... because construction engineers examine every bit of ground around the road... while they're building them.
We got to go where there's no trails... where no surveyor or anyone who knows anything of prospecting has been before.
The best place to go to is... where any salaried person wouldn't go, because he wouldn't want to risk his hide.
I got three of them!
How many did you get?
- A couple.
- I'm one up. I bet I got more than you did.
I got three. Nice shooting?
That bullet hole's two inches from my head. That was close.
The bullets were sure flying thick and fast in here.
It sounded like a swarm of bees here.
That bandit with the gold hat,
I had my sights on him, nice as you please.
The train gave a jolt and I missed.
Wish I'd got him.
Big boulder on the track so train stop.
Bandits got big surprise because soldiers on the train waiting for them.
Not many passengers get killed.
Here's where we're bound for.
Don't show whether there's mountain, swamp or desert.
That shows the makers of the map don't know.
Once on the ground, we open our eyes and look around.
Blow our noses, too.
Believe it or not, I knew a fellow... who could smell gold like a jackass can smell water.
What's all that about?
We're going into country very wild and dangerous.
Have to cut through jungles... and climb mountains so high they rise above the clouds.
Tigers so strong they can climb trees with burros in their mouths. Good.
Glad to hear such tall tales 'cause it means few outsiders have set foot there.
Well, let's get going.
If there was gold in them mountains, how long would it have been there?
Millions and millions of years, wouldn't it?
What's our hurry?
A couple of days more or less ain't going to make any difference.
Remember what you said back in Tampico... about having to pack that old man on our backs?
That was when I took him for an ordinary human being... not part goat.
Look at him climb, will you?
What gets me is how he can go all day in the sun without any water.
Maybe he's part camel, too.
If I'd known what prospecting meant...
I'd have stayed in Tampico and waited for another job to turn up.
- What's the matter?
- Look.
Look at it glitter. It's yellow, too, like...
Gold.
Come back, we've found something!
Look, Curt, there's a vein of it, here, in this rock.
Look here. Look, it's all around.
What else could it be?
Only gold shines and glitters like that.
We've struck it, Curt.
Look, from the looks of things... we've struck it rich.
Look, it's all over here.
- We found a what do you call it...
- Mother lode.
- That's right.
- Howard!
Come on. Look.
Here, look at this rock.
It's full of gold. Veins of it.
This stuff wouldn't pay your dinner for a carload.
It ain't gold?
Pyrite. Fool's gold.
Not that there ain't plenty of the real stuff here.
We've walked over it four or five times.
A place yesterday looked like rich diggings, but the water... for washing the sand was 11 miles away.
The other places, there wasn't much gold to pay us a good day's wages.
Next time you strike it rich, holler for me... before you start splashing water around.
Water's precious.
Sometimes it can be more precious than gold.
Burro.
- What's up?
- Norther, looks like.
A "norther"? What's a "norther"?
Big winds from the north this time of year... when they blow hard, this desert country stands right up on its hind legs!
There's only a few more miles of this heavy stuff.
Pretty soon we'll be out of this valley.
You fellows, how about some beans?
You want some beans?
Going through some mighty rough country tomorrow. You better have some beans.
You know what I'm thinking?
I'm thinking we ought to give up... leave the whole outfit... everything behind.
Go back to civilization.
What's that you say? Go back?
Tell my old grandmother!
I got two elegant bedfellows who kick at the first drop of rain... and hide in the closet when thunder rumbles.
What great prospectors.
Two shoe clerks reading about prospecting for gold... in the Land of the Midnight Sun, south of the border or west of the Rockies.
Shut your trap or I'll smash your head flat!
Go ahead, throw it. If you did, you'd never leave this place alive.
Without me, you two would die here more miserable than rats.
Leave him alone.
Can't you see the old man's nuts?
Nuts, am I? Let me tell you something, my fine bedfellows.
There's nothing to compare you with.
You're dumber than the dumbest jackass.
Look at each other.
Did you ever see anything like yourself for being dumb specimens?
You're so dumb... you don't even see the riches you're treading on with your own feet.
Don't expect to find nuggets of molten gold.
It's not that rich.
Here ain't the place to dig.
It comes from someplace further up.
Up there.
Up there's where we've got to go.
- Is that it?
- That's it, all right.
Gold, I mean.
Sure don't look like I thought it would.
- Not much different from sand.
- Yeah. It's just like plain sand.
It don't glitter. I thought it would.
It will when it's refined by some other guy.
All we got to do is mine it and get it back there.
Gold ain't like stones in a riverbed.
It don't cry out to be picked up.
You got to know how to recognize it.
The finding ain't all. Not by a long shot.
Got to know how to tickle her so she'll come out laughing.
Yeah, it's mighty rich. It'll pay good.
- How good?
- About 20 ounces to the ton.
- That's $20 an ounce.
- How many tons can we handle a week?
Depends on how hard we work.
We better pitch our camp down the mountainside.
Why, when the digging's here?
Anyone comes by, we say we're hunters, and get away with it maybe.
- Wouldn't it be easier to file a claim?
- Easier but not so profitable.
An emissary from a big mining company would be here soon... with a paper in his hand showing we had no right to be here.
How does it feel to be men of property?
The tanks'll leak some at first... until the boards begin to swell and close the seams.
I sure had some cockeyed ideas about prospecting for gold.
It was all in the finding, I thought.
I thought you just had to find it, pick it up, put it in sacks... and carry them off to the nearest bank.
You're learning. Pretty soon
I won't be able to tell you a thing.
- Tank full yet?
- Right to the top.
Open the sluice gate.
How much do you figure it to be now?
About $5,000 worth, I reckon.
When are we going to start dividing it up?
Anytime you say.
Why divide it at all? I don't see any point.
We're all going back together when the time comes.
Why not wait till we get paid and then divide the money?
Either way suits me. You fellows decide.
I'm for dividing it up as we go along.
Make each guy responsible for his own goods.
I'd just as soon have it that way.
I don't like the responsibility of guarding your treasure.
Who asked you to?
That's right. You never asked me.
Only, I thought I was the most trustworthy of the three.
You?
How come?
I said the most trustworthy. As far as being the most honest, no one can say.
I don't get you.
Suppose you're charged of taking care of the goods.
One day I'm deep in the brush and Curtin's on his way to get provisions.
That'd be your chance to pack up and leave us in the cold.
Only a guy that's a thief at heart would think me likely to do a thing like that.
Right now, it wouldn't be worth your while... but when the pile's grown to 300 ounces, think of such things you will.
How's about yourself?
I'm not quick on my feet any longer.
You're a lot tougher than when we started out.
By the time the pile's grown to be really tempting...
I won't be able to run half as fast as you.
You'd catch me and string me up in no time.
That's why I think
I'm the most trustworthy.
Looking at it that way,
I guess you're right.
Maybe it'd be a good idea... to cut the proceeds up three ways every night.
It'll relieve you of a responsibility you don't like.
Swell by me.
After we got a couple of hundred ounces... it'll be a nuisance carrying bags around our necks.
Each of us will have to hide his share from the others.
And after that, he'll have to be forever on watch that his hiding place's not found.
What a dirty, filthy mind you've got.
Not dirty, baby.
Only I know what kind of ideas... even supposedly decent people get when gold's at stake.
All right.
Here she goes three ways.
Dobbs!
Howard, come quick!
He's coming around.
Lay still a minute till you get your senses back.
What happened?
Part of the mine caved in on you.
Got a knock on the head.
No bones broken?
I don't think so.
- Who pulled me out?
- Curtin did.
I owe my life to you, partner.
Forget it.
What'll you do with your hard-earned money... when we get back and cash in?
I'm getting along in years.
I can still hold up my end... when it comes to a hard day's work, but I'm not the man I was once.
Next year, next month, next week, by thunder, won't be the man I'm today.
I think I'll settle down in a quiet place... get a little business, hardware, grocery store... spend the better part of my time reading comics and adventure stories.
One thing's for sure.
I won't go prospecting again... wasting time and money trying to find another gold mine.
How about yourself?
What plans have you, if any?
I figure on buying some land and growing fruit. Peaches, maybe.
How did you come to settle on peaches?
One summer, when I was a kid...
I worked as a picker in a peach harvest in the San Joaquin Valley.
Boy, it sure was something.
Hundreds of people, old and young.
Whole families working together.
At night, after a day's work... we used to build big bonfires and sit around and sing to guitar music.
Till morning sometimes.
We'd go to sleep, wake up and sing, and go to sleep again.
Everybody had a wonderful time.
Ever since then I've had a hankering to be a fruit grower.
It must be grand watching your own trees put on leaves... come into blossom and bear.
Watching the fruit get big and ripe on the boughs, ready for picking.
What's all that about?
We're telling each other what we aim to do when we get back.
Now me, I got it all figured out what I'm gonna do.
Tell us about it, Dobbsie.
First off, I'm going to a Turkish bath to sweat and soak... till I get all the grime and dirt out of my system.
Then I'm going to a haberdasher and gonna get myself a brand-new set of duds.
Dozen of everything.
Then I'm going to a swell cafe... order everything on the bill o' fare and if it ain't just right... or maybe even if it is,
I'm gonna bawl the waiter out... and make him take the whole thing back.
What's next on the program?
Well, what would be?
If I were you, I wouldn't talk or think about women.
It ain't good for your health.
Yeah, maybe you're right, seeing how the prospects are far off.
You know what?
We ought to put a limit on our take, agree between us... when we get so much we pull up stakes and beat it.
- What do you think the limit ought to be?
- Say $25,000 worth apiece.
$25,000, small potatoes.
How much do you say?
$50,000 anyway,
$75,000 would be more like it.
That'd take a year if the vein held out, which wouldn't be likely.
What's a year more or less when that kind of money is to be had?
$25,000 is plenty as far as I'm concerned.
Enough to last me the rest of my lifetime.
Well, sure, you're old, I'm young.
I need dough and plenty of it.
$25,000 in one piece... is more than I ever expected to get my hands on.
Small potatoes.
There's no use making hogs of ourselves.
Hog, am I?
Maybe you don't know, but I'd be within my rights... if I demanded half again as much as you get.
How come?
There's no denying I put up the lion's share of the cash.
So you did, Dobbsie, and I always meant to pay you back.
In any civilized place the biggest investor gets the biggest return, don't he?
That's one thing in favor of the wilds.
Not that I intended to demand it, but I'd be within my rights if I did.
Next time you call me a hog just remember... what I could've done if I'd wanted to.
I think it'd be wise not to put things strictly on a money basis.
Here you are, Dobbs.
What I owe you with interest.
I just don't like being called a hog, that's all.
Don't scare me like that.
I might have let you have it.
Out for a midnight stroll?
Tiger around,
I went to check on the burros.
- So?
- What's the matter?
- I think I'll see if the burros are all right.
- Go ahead. Help yourself.
- What's up?
- Nothing's up.
Where is Dobbs?
Poking around in the dark out there.
He's sure taking a long time out there.
I think I'll go have a look-see.
Where's Curtin?
He's out there somewhere.
Said he was gonna have a look-see.
It's my turn again but I won't take it... if you stop worrying about your goods and go to bed.
We got work to do tomorrow.
Can't catch me sleeping.
Don't you ever believe that.
I'm not that dumb.
The day you try to put anything over on me... it'll be a costly one for both of you.
Any more lip out of you and I'll up and let you have it.
If you know what's good for you, you won't monkey around with Fred C. Dobbs.
You ought to see Dobbs.
He's talking to himself a mile a minute.
Something's eating him all right,
I don't know what.
He's just spoiling for trouble.
"We're running short of provisions,
Dobbsie.
"How about you going to the village?"
Who does Howard think he is, ordering me around?
What's that, Dobbs?
- Nothing.
- Better look out.
It's a bad sign when a guy talks to himself.
Yeah? Who else am I gonna talk to?
Certainly not you or Curtin.
- Fine partners you two are.
- Got something up your nose?
Blow it out, it'll do you good.
Don't think you two are putting anything over on me.
- Take it easy.
- I know what your game is.
You know more than I do.
Why am I elected to go to the village instead of you or Curtin?
Don't think I don't see through that.
You two are together against me.
The two days I'd be gone... would give you lots of time to discover where my goods are.
If you fear along those lines... why don't you take your goods with you?
And run the risk of having them taken from me by bandits?
If you run into them, you'd be out of luck anyway.
They'd kill you for the shoes on your feet.
So that's it. Everything's clear now.
You're hoping bandits will get me.
That would save you a lot of trouble, wouldn't it?
And your consciences wouldn't bother you none neither.
All right, Dobbs, forget about it.
Just like I thought.
- What's the idea?
- Put your hands up.
I've a good mind to haul off and pump you up, chest and belly alike.
Would you mind telling me what this is about?
It won't get you anywhere playing dumb.
Well, I'll be.
- So that's where your goods are hidden?
- Hey, what's the trouble here?
Seems like I accidentally stumbled on Dobbsie's treasure.
Accidentally? Why were you trying to pry up that rock?
I saw a gila monster crawl under it.
Brother, I got to hand it to you.
You can certainly pick up a good story when you need one.
Okay, I'm a liar.
There isn't a gila monster under there.
Let's see you stick your hand in and get your goods out.
- Go ahead.
- Sure I will.
But you try any bad moves...
Don't worry. I'll stay right where I am.
I want to see this.
Reach in and get your goods.
If you don't, we'll think you're yellow, won't we, Howard?
They never let go, do they, Howard, once they grab onto you?
You can cut them in two and the head will still hang on till sundown, I hear.
By that time the victim doesn't usually care 'cause he's dead.
- Isn't that right, Howard?
- I reckon.
Why don't you stick your hand in and get your treasure?
Couldn't be because you're scared... after the way you've been shooting your mouth off?
Show us you ain't yellow.
I'd hate to think my partner had a yellow streak up his back.
I'll kill you, you dirty, thieving...
Okay, Howard, I got him covered.
Another bad move out of you and I'll blow you to kingdom come.
Howard, turn that rock over, will you?
The federales are very efficient.
Yeah. Bandidos, eh?
Yeah, seems between them they had a diamond ring... pearl earrings, a lot of money and a railway ticket... with the date of the Aguascalientes train robbery on it.
They've been here several days, drinking, shooting...
The villagers are afraid to go out of their huts.
Where are they taking them now?
To the cemetery.
The federales don't operate in our American way.
They're not fingerprint experts, but they can follow any trail.
Against them, no hideout is any use.
They know all the tricks of the bandits.
You can bet your sweet soul they'll trace down... every last one of that group that attacked the train.
It'll take time, months maybe, but they'll do it.
Not many Americans get around this way.
You're the first
I've bumped into in a long time.
That so?
- Mighty rugged country hereabouts.
- Yeah.
My name's Cody.
I'm from Texas.
- What's your game?
- I'm a hunter.
- Professional?
- Yeah.
What all do you hunt?
Tiger cats, anything of commercial value.
How long did you say you'd been in these mountains?
A few months.
Ever seen anything that looked like pay dirt?
I've a hunch there's loads of the real goods up in those mountains.
No, I know the whole landscape around here.
If there'd been gold, you can bet I'd have seen it.
There's nothing doing here for gold.
I can look at a hill five miles away... and tell you if it carries an ounce or a shipload.
If you haven't found anything...
I'll come with you, put your nose in it.
There's indications in the valley, lots of indications.
By tracing the rocks,
I find they come from a ridge... washed down by the tropical rains.
- You don't say so.
- Yes, I say so.
So much for those bandits.
You gotta hand it to the Mexicans when it comes to swift justice.
Once the federales get their mitts on a criminal... they know what to do.
They hand him a shovel, tell him to dig.
When he's dug deep enough... they tell him to put the shovel down, smoke a cigarette and say his prayers.
In another five minutes he's being covered over with the earth he dug out.
Yeah, you gotta hand it to them all right.
I meant what I said about going along with you. Those are my burros.
I'm ready to start if you'll let me go with you to your camp.
Thanks anyway, but I prefer going it by myself.
Good luck.
I went way around, stayed on hard ground which wouldn't show the tracks.
Every time I hit a high point and looked
I'd see he was still following me.
I guess it's only a matter of time till he shows up here.
- I move we tell him straight off to beat it.
- Now, no, that'd be foolish.
He'd sit for an hour playing the innocent and then report us to the officials.
Once they come, we can't stay or take our goods with us if we left.
There's nothing else to do but kill him the minute he appears.
No crime to visit these mountains.
He may be a guy that likes to wander.
You can't shoot him for that.
If you were to shoot him it might come out.
We don't have to shoot him necessarily.
We can push him off a rock and claim it was an accident.
Just who's gonna do the pushing, you?
We'll toss for it.
You're sure he was trailing you, are you?
- Absolutely.
- How come?
Because there he is.
Come over by the fire.
I know quite well, you fellas, I'm not wanted here.
Even after what you told me...
I couldn't resist the desire to sit and jaw with an American.
Why don't you go where Americans want to talk to you?
Durango isn't too far off.
They got one of them American clubs there.
I'm not after that.
I've got other things on my mind, more important.
So do we. Don't make any mistakes.
Our biggest worry is your presence here.
We got no use for you.
We don't even want you for a cook or a dishwasher.
No vacancies, understand?
In case I don't make myself clear, you'll be doing yourself a favor... packing up and getting out tomorrow morning.
Go back where you came from.
Take our blessings with you.
Thanks.
Go ahead. Help yourself. We're no misers.
We don't let guys starve to death.
Tonight, you're our guest.
But tomorrow morning...
Iook out, no trespassing around here, you know?
"Beware of the dogs." Get it?
I got myself five foxes and a lion while you were away at the village.
- How are the hides?
- Pretty good.
- Where'd you hit them?
- Right through their eyes.
Excuse me for butting in, but there's no game here worth going after.
It wouldn't take a week for a hunter... to clean up all around for five miles in each direction.
Yes, there's no good hunting here.
That's why we made up our mind to leave... so that we could look for something better.
Yes, stranger, you're dead right.
Awful poor ground.
It took us some time to find it out.
Poor ground, you say?
Depends on what you're looking for.
For game, yes.
Mighty good ground for something else.
What might that be?
Gold.
That's a good one.
I told you in the village, there's no gold around here.
If there was one single ounce of it,
I'd have seen it, believe me.
If you haven't found any gold here, you're not as smart as you appear to be.
Well, maybe, you're right.
Who knows?
We never thought about gold.
Gives me an idea.
Guess I'll sleep on it.
I'll hit the hay.
Yeah. Me, too.
See you in the morning, mister.
I can't figure this bird out.
Is he wise to us or not?
Whether he is or not, he looks fairly harmless to me.
- Looks can be mighty deceiving.
- No denying that.
I'm keeping my boots on this night.
Might take it in his head to murder us in our sleep.
- Anything can happen. I'll tell you what.
- Well, then?
You guys go to sleep and I'll be watchdog for a few hours.
Then you both can take your turns.
- Okay. Got your gun handy?
- Yeah. Right here.
Good morning, friend.
Where'd you get the water to make coffee?
- I took it out of the olla.
- You did, did you?
We didn't carry that water here for you to make coffee.
- I didn't know water was so hard to get.
- You know it now.
I'll fill it up for you.
What's up?
I caught this guy stealing our water.
The next time I'll let it out of you through little round holes.
I thought I was among civilized men who wouldn't begrudge me fresh water.
Who's not civilized?
I could easily do the same for you.
It's not settled yet who'd come out on top.
This time I took it.
Thanks for your kind attention.
If I was you, stranger,
I'd pack up and go while the going's good.
I mean to stay right here.
The brush and the mountains are free, aren't they?
Sure. That's right, whoever's first on the spot.
That holds for hunters, but not for gold miners.
Unless they have happened to have registered their claim.
Who says we have a claim to register?
Whatever you say or don't say, tomorrow I start to dig for gold here.
I know you guys can bump me off any minute... but that's a risk worth running considering the stakes.
Let's lay all our cards on the table.
As I see it, you guys have to do one of three things:
Kill me, run me off or take me in with you as a partner.
Let's consider the first.
Another guy may come along tomorrow.
Maybe a dozen other guys.
If you start killing them... how far are you prepared to go?
Ask yourselves that.
Also, don't forget, the one actually to do the bumping off... would forever be in the power of the other two.
The only safe way would be for all of you to drag out your cannons... and bang away at the same instant like a firing squad.
We wouldn't stop at anything to protect our interests.
I claim killing me isn't it.
But, of course, that's for you to decide.
As for choice number two... you run me off,
I might very well inform on you.
We'd get you if you did that.
We'd get you if we had to go all the way to China.
25º% of the value of your find is the reward I'd get.
And that would be mighty tempting.
It's a strong argument in favor of number one.
I don't deny it.
But let's see what number three has to offer.
If you take me in as a partner, you don't stand to lose anything.
I'll not ask a share in what you've made so far, only in the profits to come.
What do you say?
Mind, stranger, letting us talk this over among ourselves?
Not at all. Go ahead.
I have to look after my burros anyway.
- What do you think?
- Sending him away is out of the question.
Either we bump him off or make him a partner.
F.C. Dobbs ain't a guy that likes being taken advantage of.
Do the mug in, I say.
He told us how, didn't he?
All of us hold out our cannons and let him have it.
What do we gain by bumping him off?
If he was asking to share in what we made it'd be different.
I don't mind being taken advantage of... if it isn't money out of my pocket.
And whoever else comes along... they're to be invited in, too.
Come one, come all?
You got a point there.
No question about that.
But killing...
- What's the matter, ain't you up to it?
- Sure, I'm up to it.
Let the majority decide.
What's your vote, partner?
For or against?
For.
Let's make it short and sweet for him.
So it's number one, is it?
Better take a look down that hill first.
I can't make out what they are.
They must be soldiers.
So that's your stinking game, is it?
Informing. I knew you were an informer.
I knew it all the time.
You're wrong, brother.
This means all our funerals.
What's that?
If it's what I think it is, may the Lord be with us.
They're not soldiers, they're bandits.
After guns and ammunition, not gold.
Some villager must have told them about the American hunter.
They don't look like soldiers to me, either.
They are bandits.
We better start thinking of a way to defend ourselves.
We can hide in the rocks but we'll lose the burros and the whole outfit.
The best thing is to fight.
You have good eyes.
Stay here on this lookout... for the time being and watch their movements.
You herd all the burros in that thicket there.
Dobbs, we'll wrap up all our belongings and dump them in the trench.
They're turning onto the trail.
- How many of them are there?
- About a dozen.
They'll be an hour getting here so we better eat something.
Come on down, friend.
Look, Howard.
The one in the gold hat, remember?
Yeah, the man in the train robbery.
They think whoever was here is gone.
Some want to go back down the mountains, others want to stay... and use this site as headquarters to raid the villages.
How about pouring it into them?
- Bumping off as many as we can, real fast?
- No, let's hold our horses.
We are federales.
You know, the mounted police.
If you are the police, where are your badges?
Badges? We ain't got no badges.
We don't need no badges.
I don't have to show you any stinking badges.
Better not come any closer.
We didn't try to do you any harm.
Why don't you try to be a little more polite?
Give us your gun and we'll leave you in peace.
I need my gun myself.
Throw that old iron over here.
We'll pick it up and go on our way.
You go anyway without my gun, and go quick.
All right.
Look here, amigo, you got the wrong idea.
We don't want to get your gun for nothing. We want to buy it.
Look, I have a gold watch with a gold chain... made in your own country.
The watch and the chain, they're worth at least 200 pesos.
I'll change it for your gun.
You better take it.
That's a good business for you.
You keep your watch, I'll keep my gun.
Oh, you'll keep it? You will keep it?
We won't get it?
I'll show you.
Anybody get hurt?
Looks like we won that round.
- That guy with the gold hat, ain't he...
- We spotted him, too. The train robber.
- Maybe they got enough?
- I doubt it.
Since they know there's four guns, they'll be more determined than ever.
- What do you suppose they'll pull next?
- No telling. All we can do is sit tight.
Cody, are you all right?
He's dead.
Got it right through the neck.
One less gun.
Chopping wood for camp, that's funny.
If they're up to what I think they are, it ain't funny.
- What's that?
- They're building moving barricades.
An old Indian trick.
They crawl and push the barricades.
You can't see where to shoot.
I'd be willing to trade my share of the mine right now for a few hand grenades.
You'd better get to your posts.
They're beating it.
- What do you make of that?
- Your guess is as good as mine.
Wait a minute, this may be some trick to lure us out.
I don't think so. They ain't good enough actors for this kind of a trick.
Hey, partner. Up here.
Here's a sight if there ever was one.
Federales. Look at them.
I could kiss every one of them.
They must've gotten it from the villagers there were bandits headed here.
Why don't they wait here, make a fight of it?
They know all the tricks, that's why.
With us behind and the federales facing them, they wouldn't have a chance.
Go get them, sic 'em time.
Chew them up and don't spit them out.
Swallow them.
Am I happy.
Tell you the truth,
I was already eating dirt.
I wonder who he is.
And if he's got any folks.
Supposing he has?
Let's take a look at his belongings.
A few hundred pesos.
Name's James Cody. Dallas, Texas.
A letter from Dallas, too.
It must be his home.
Reckon she's his girl.
Not bad.
"Dear Jim: Your letter just arrived.
"It was such a relief to get word after so many months of...
"silence.
"I realize, of course, that...
"there aren't any mailboxes that you can drop a letter in...
"out there in the wild."
You better read it.
"But that doesn't keep me from worrying about you.
"Little Jimmy is fine, but he misses his daddy almost as much as I do.
"He keeps asking,
'When's Daddy coming home? '
"You say if you do not make a real find this time...
"you'll never go again.
"I cannot begin to tell you how my heart rejoices...
"at those words, if you really mean them.
"Now I feel free to tell you...
"I've never thought any material treasure...
"no matter how great, is worth the pain of these long separations.
"The country is especially lovely this year.
"It's been a perfect spring.
Warm rains and hardly any frost.
"The fruit trees are all in bloom.
"The upper orchard looks aflame...
"and the lower, like after a snowstorm.
"Everybody looks forward to big crops.
"I do hope you are back for the harvest.
"Of course, I'm hoping that you will at last strike it rich.
"It is high time for luck...
"to start smiling upon you.
"But just in case she doesn't...
"remember we've already found life's real treasure.
"Forever yours, Helen."
I guess we better dig a hole for him.
Yeah, not so good.
Not so good as yesterday.
Want my opinion?
It'll be a lot less from now on.
We've taken all the gold this mountain has.
How much do you figure we got to date?
Not as much as we were aiming to collect.
Not $40,000.
I'm willing to lower my hindsight.
We've got upwards of $35,000 apiece.
I tell you, we ought to be plenty thankful.
Let's call it quits and pack up and leave.
The sooner the better as far as I'm concerned.
I don't want to keep that dame waiting.
It'll take a week to break the mine, put the mountain back in shape.
Do what to the mountain?
Make her look like she was before we came.
I don't get it.
We wounded this place.
It's our duty to close her wounds.
The least we can do to show our gratitude for all the wealth she's given us.
If you guys don't want to help me,
I'll do it alone.
You talk about that mountain like it was a real woman.
She's been a lot better to me than any woman I ever knew.
Keep your shirt on, old-timer.
Sure, I'll help you.
I reckon that's about everything.
Each man's burros with his goods will be his own responsibility.
Come on.
Goodbye, mountain, and thanks.
Yeah, thanks, mountain.
I've been thinking about her.
Cody's widow, I mean, and the kid.
You know what?
We ought to give them a fourth just as if he'd been our partner from the start.
What? A fourth of all our goods?
- That's right.
- Are you crazy?
If not for him, we wouldn't have walked away from that mountain.
Ask Howard.
The buzzard would have gotten fat on us all right.
Yeah, it might just as well have been one of us.
But it wasn't.
It's our good luck and his bad.
Whatever you guys do,
I'm going to give a fourth.
I got more than I need, anyhow.
Half what I got is enough to last me out.
Fourth? Sure.
You two guys must have been born in a revival meeting.
We got company.
Steady, boys.
Coffee.
Give him some tobacco.
We give them our tobacco, they give us theirs, I don't get it.
Why not everybody smoke his own?
Take some and thank them.
They're after something.
Takes them a while to come to the point.
To say what you want right off the bat isn't considered polite among Indians.
They got nothing but time?
His boy fell in the water, they fished him out.
- He ain't dead, but he just won't come to.
- Tough.
I'll go have a look at the boy.
I'll be back in a little while.
Before morning, probably.
Look after my goods while I am gone.
Tequila.
Artificial respiration did it and a few Boy Scout tricks.
I think it was more shock than drowning.
He hadn't swallowed much water.
Maybe he was stunned while diving.
How did these Indians know we were in this neck of the woods anyhow?
When you're near their villages, don't ask me how, they just know.
What's up?
He's insisting we return to his village and be his guests.
Tell him to forget it.
Tell him he don't owe us a thing.
If he doesn't pay off his debt all the saints will be angry.
This is no laughing matter.
I'm afraid he's determined to take us with him, even if it means force.
I'll handle this.
Wait a minute. You can't fight your way out of this. Put your guns away.
Have every Indian in the mountain on our trail. We'd be scalped in half an hour.
What'd he say then?
It didn't make any difference about you guys but I have to come.
- It's like that, he just wants you.
- Looks like it.
Why don't you go with them?
Stay a few days and we'll meet you in Durango. We'll wait there.
- What about my goods?
- Why don't you take them with you.
If they found out they might forget he was their honored guest and bump him off.
What'll I do? Dump them on the ground?
We'll take them with us if you want us to and wait for you in Durango.
I reckon that's about the only solution.
I bet you'll remember this the next time you try to do a good deed.
Maybe after I've stayed with them they'll give me a horse.
Then I'll be a day or two behind you.
That'll be swell. Good luck, Howard.
Yeah, all the luck in the world.
We'll be lonesome without you. But my Sunday school teacher used to say:
"You got to learn to swallow disappointments in this sad life."
Hurry up and join us.
Look out for those Indian dames.
They tell me they're smart.
One of them squaws might marry you.
Maybe I'll do just that. Pick out a good-looking squaw and marry her.
They're easy to dress, feed and entertain.
They don't nag at you, either.
So long, partners.
See you in Durango.
Ain't it always his burros that won't march in line... stray off the trail and smash their packs against the trees and rocks?
I wish they'd stray off far enough to fall down about 2,000 feet of gorge.
Why'd you offer to carry his goods for him?
As if he couldn't manage by himself.
He knew what he was doing when he turned them over to us.
Mighty cute of him, wasn't it?
What's the use of railing against the old man? It won't do any good.
Save your breath for the next piece of trail.
I'm stopping here for the night.
If you want to go on it's okay with me, but take his burros with you.
They ain't my responsibility.
It's early. We can make four, five miles more before dark.
Nobody ordered you to stay here.
You can go 20 miles more for all I care.
Ordered me?
You?
Who's ordering who to do anything?
You talk like you're boss of this outfit.
Maybe you are, let's hear you say it.
All right, if you can't go any further.
Who says I can't? Don't make me laugh.
I can go four times as far as a mug like you.
But I don't want to. I could if I want to, but I don't want to, see, mug?
What's the use of hollering?
We're started on something and we've got to finish it, like it or not.
We'll camp here.
Wonder what the old man's doing now.
Eating a meal of roast turkey and drinking a bottle of tequila probably.
This is the first day we've had to manage without his help.
Once we get the hang of it, it'll be easier.
How far away do you suppose the railroad is?
- Not so far as the crow flies.
- We ain't crows.
I figure we can reach the high-pass in two days more... then it'll be three or four days to the railroad.
That's figuring no hard luck on the trail, of course.
What's the joke, Dobbsie?
Aren't you going to let me in on it?
In on it? Sure I will.
Sure.
Go ahead, spill it. What's so funny?
I was thinking what a bonehead play that old jackass made...
- when he put all his goods in our keeping.
- What do you mean?
Figured he'd let us do his sweating for him, did he?
- We'll show him.
- What are you getting at?
Can't you see? It's all ours.
We don't go back to Durango at all.
Not at all.
I don't follow you.
Don't be such a sap.
Where did you ever grow up?
All right, to make it clear to a dumbhead like you... we take all his goods and go straight up north and leave the jackass flat.
You aren't serious, are you? You don't really mean what you are saying.
Fred C. Dobbs don't say nothing he don't mean.
As long as I'm here and can do anything, you won't touch the old man's goods.
I know exactly what you mean.
You want to take it all for yourself and cut me out.
No, I'm on the level with the old man, like I'd be with you if you weren't here.
Get off your soapbox. You only sound foolish out here in this wilderness.
I know you for what you are.
For a long time I've had my suspicions about you and now I know I've been right.
- What suspicions?
- You're not putting anything over on me.
I see right through you.
For a long time you've wanted to bump me off at the first opportunity... and bury me out here in the bush like a dog... so you could take not only the old man's goods but mine in the bargain.
When you get to Durango safely you'll have a big laugh... thinking how dumb the old man and I were.
You make another move towards me and I'll pull the trigger.
Now, get your hands up.
Come on, get them up.
Was I right, or was I?
You and your Sunday school talk about protecting people's goods.
You. Go on, stand up, and take it like a man.
Come on, get up.
Let go of it.
- The cards are dealt the other way now.
- Yeah.
Now listen to me...
Look, you're all wrong.
Not for a moment did I ever intend to rob you or do you any harm.
Just like I said...
I'd fight for you and yours like I'd fight for the old man's.
If you really mean that give me back my gun.
My pal.
Wouldn't it be better the way things are to separate tomorrow or even tonight?
- That would suit you fine, wouldn't it?
- Why me more than you?
So you could fall on me from behind, sneak up and shoot me in the back.
All right, I'll go first.
And wait for me on the trail to ambush me?
Why wouldn't I do it now if I meant to kill you?
I'll tell you why, because you're yellow.
You don't have the nerve to pull the trigger while I'm looking you in the eye.
If you think like that, there's nothing to do but to tie you up every night.
I'll tell you what. I'll make you a little bet.
Three times 35 is 105.
I'll bet $105,000 you go to sleep before I do.
Get up there at the head of the train.
Get up!
The cards are dealt the other way now, and for the last time. No more shuffling.
- What cards are...
- I'm going to finish this right now.
I won't take orders from you like I had to do today.
- You mean you're going to murder me?
- No, brother, not murder. Your mistake.
I'm doing it to save my life that you'd take from me when I wasn't looking at you.
- The old man'll catch up with you.
- He will, will he?
I got an answer for that one, too.
Know what I'll tell him?
I'll tell him you tied me to a tree and made your getaway taking all our goods.
He'll be looking for you and not me.
Up. March. Today I had to march to your music, now you march to mine.
- Where?
- To your funeral.
Come on, keep going.
Get up. Sleepy?
You'll be asleep soon enough.
Sound asleep.
Maybe I didn't kill him.
Maybe he just staggered and fell down without being hit.
You keep it, it's yours anyhow.
No, they won't find him.
I'll dig a hole for him first thing in the morning.
This fire... don't give much heat.
Conscience.
What a thing.
If you believe you've got a conscience, it'll pester you to death.
But if you don't believe you've got one... what can it do to you?
Makes me sick all this talking and fussing about nonsense.
Maybe I'd better leave him like he is.
Ain't very likely anybody will find him.
In a week, the buzzards and the ants will have done away with him anyway.
I don't know what's getting into me.
Was that really a tiger?
No.
What if his eyes are open, looking at me?
Best thing to do is to get to the railroad in a hurry.
Burro.
It's better not to have buried him.
I did right, yeah.
What I should have done, maybe, was bury his clothes... and leave him to the ants and the buzzards.
Buzzards!
If somebody saw them circling, they'd know something was dead.
Buzzards ain't spotted him yet.
Lucky for me.
Curtin!
Where are you?
I better get a hold of myself.
I mustn't lose my head.
There's one thing certain, he ain't here.
I got it. The tiger.
Yeah, that's it. The tiger must have dragged him off to his lair, that's what.
Yeah, pretty soon, not even the bones will be left to tell the story.
Done as if by order.
I came to in the middle of the night.
My gun was on the ground beside me.
He must have left it there to make it look like suicide.
I figured he'd come back in the morning to see if I still had a flicker of life.
I thought about waiting for him and letting him have it... but there was a good chance in my condition I might miss... so I decided to crawl away like a poisoned dog.
- Take it easy, you're talking too much.
- Don't you worry about me.
I'll pull out of this if only to get that guy.
It appears our fine Mr. Dobbs has made off with our goods and is on his way north.
- Yeah.
- I reckon we can't blame him too much.
What do you mean?
I mean, he's not a real killer, as killers go.
I think he's as honest as the next fella, or almost.
The mistake was leaving you two in the depths of the wilderness... with more than $100,000 between you.
That's a big temptation, partner, believe me.
He shot me down in cold blood.
After I was down he shot me a second time just to make sure.
If I was young and out there with one of you, I'd have been tempted, too.
Maybe I wouldn't have fallen, but I reckon I would've been tempted.
There now. You're almost as good as new.
Now, to find that thief and get our goods back.
They're not only giving me a horse but coming to protect me.
- You ain't going.
- Who says so?
You wouldn't be up to the hard riding.
- You aren't leaving me behind.
- Look at you.
You're weak as a kitten.
Don't worry, I'll look after our interests.
I'm going.
Well, I reckon you're going.
Burro!
Have you got any cigarettes?
No, I haven't. I've got a little tobacco... if that'll do.
No paper to roll it in?
Papers?
Here you are.
- Going to Durango?
- Yeah.
That's where I'm headed.
I've got to sell my burros.
I got to get some money.
I haven't got a red cent.
Matches?
Money? We need money, too.
Yeah? I could use a good mule driver... maybe two or three.
How much is the pay?
Two pesos.
Of course, I can't pay you in advance...
I got to wait till I get to town so I can get the money.
Do I know you from someplace?
Maybe I know you.
No, I don't think so.
- Are you alone?
- No.
I'm not alone.
I got a couple of friends coming along on horseback.
Yeah, they ought to be here any minute.
That's funny.
A man all by himself in bandit country with a string of burros... and his friends behind him on horseback.
Your friends must be very far behind you.
Pablo cannot see any dust even from their horses.
They'll be along any minute, I tell you.
I know who you are.
You're the guy in the hole.
The one who wouldn't give us the rifle.
I never laid eyes on you until now.
What you got in the bags?
- Seems to me like hides.
- Yeah.
That's what they are, hides.
Ought to bring in quite a lot of money.
Yeah.
Sure you don't want to come along with me and help me with the burros?
Burro.
Get away from my burro.
We can sell those burros for just as good a price as you'd get.
Get away from my burro.
You can't frighten even a sick louse with that. You can only shoot one of us... and he wouldn't mind too much.
The federales are after him anyway.
So what with your gun?
- We'll take that chance.
- Get back there.
- Shooting.
- Volley. Execution, probably.
- Dobbs is dead.
- What?
- Bandits got him.
- Our goods. What about our goods?
- What?
- He says our goods are safe in his office.
- It's not here, Howard.
- Keep your shirt on.
What?
He heard the bandits talking while they were waiting to be shot.
They thought it was bags of sand hidden among the hide... to make it weigh more when Dobbs went to sell them.
Where are they?
They're in the ruins outside town.
Come on!
Looks like a norther.
Laugh, Curtin, old boy, it's a great joke played on us... by the Lord, or fate, or nature, whatever you prefer... but whoever or whatever played it certainly had a sense of humor!
The gold has gone back to where we found it!
This is worth ten months of suffering and labor, this joke is!
Well, Howard, what next I wonder?
I'm all fixed as far as I'm concerned as a medicine man.
I'll have three meals a day, five if I want... roof over my head, and a drink now and then to warm me up.
I will be worshipped, fed, and treated like a high priest... for telling people what they want to hear.
Good medicine men are born, not made.
Come and see me sometime, my boy.
Even you'll take off your hat when you see how respected I am.
The day before yesterday, they wanted to make me their legislature.
Their whole legislature!
I don't know what that means. I think it's the highest honor they can bestow.
Yeah, I'm all fixed for the rest of my natural life.
How about yourself?
What do you aim to do?
I haven't got any idea.
You're young. You've got plenty of time to make three or four fortunes.
You know, the worst ain't so bad when it finally happens.
Not half as bad as you figure it'll be before it happens.
I'm no worse off than I was in Tampico.
All I'm out is $200 when you come right down to it.
Not very much compared to what Dobbsie lost.
Any special place you're bent on going?
No, all places are the same to me.
You can keep my share of what the burros and the hides'll bring... if you use it to buy a ticket to Dallas.
See Cody's widow. Better than writing.
And besides, it's July and the fruit harvest.
How about it?
It's a deal.
Well, let's get going.
- Goodbye, Curtin.
- Goodbye, Howard.
- Good luck.
- Same to you.
Ladies and gentlemen,
here is tonight's extra special attraction.
That ridin', ropin'fool, your western pal and mine,
Bronco Bob Mitchell.
"Bunko" Bob Mitchell!
That phony's never been west of the Hudson River.
How about all those books he wrote?
I Fought Cattle Rustlers.
I Caught Horse Thieves.
I caught him where it hurts.
Read my column today.
If it's true, it'll be the biggest scoop of the year. Sure it's true.
I'm making book at 10-to-1 Bronco Bob doesn't show up tonight or any night.
Bob, you've never been on a horse in your life. I'll bet the horse knows it.
Forget the riding. Walk out there and sing 'em a song.
I'll tell 'em you've got a broken neck.
Pete, you saw what Martin
Manning wrote in his column. Yeah.
Do you want my public to think he's right? He is right!
I admit starting all this Bronco
Bob buildup to sell your books but...
Mr. Mitchell, you're on. But can he stay on?
Not that side, the other side. Even I know that.
Anne, you should be gettin' ready for the contest.
And miss a chance to hear Bronco Bob sing?
That $10,000 will wait a few minutes.
Give me my saddle
And let me ride
The painted hills
I love
Where I can speak with passing stars
And touch the moon above
Give me my saddle
And let me go
Up where the rivers start
Where I can let a western breeze
Go singing through my heart
They must have used a magic brush
To paint the West so fair
I know it must be just a step
Up to heaven from there
So give me my saddle
And while I live
I only want to ride
The purple hills and have my love
A-ridin' by my side
So give me my saddle
And while I live
I only want to ride
The purple hills and have my love
A- ridin' by my side
A-ridin' by
My side
Giddyup.!
Come on, boy.
Giddyup, faster. Come on, giddyup. Giddyup.!
Woo-ooo!
Giddyup, giddyup.
Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo.
Giddyup!
Hey, Willoughby, get off that horse before the boss catches you.
Look out, Duke.
I'll run over you.
Get off that horse, I'm warnin' you. I'm playin' cowboy.
You know what the boss told you. What?
The next time he catches you playing cowboy he's gonna fire you.
Yeah? Come on, help me sell this stuff.
Duke, did you see me? I was standing next to a real, live jackass.
Did you ever ride a jackass? No.
You oughta get on to yourself. Come on. Peanuts!
I get it.
You think I'm a dummy?
Hot dogs, red hot!
Hot dogs!
Hot... dog!
Mmm-mmm.
Did you ever ride a jackass? No.
Jump on my back.
No.
Manning, did my boy convince you he's the real thing? So he can ride a horse.
That doesn't prove he's the great western hero his books say he is.
Won't anything ever convince you?
I'll make you a little...
Excuse me. I'll have a hot dog.
Hot dogs.!
Don't push!
Peanuts! Hot dogs! Get 'em while the manager's hot.
Boy, five peanuts.
Boy, five peanuts.
Five peanuts, right?
Here you are.
Here's one, two, three, four and a half, five.
The man wants five bags of peanuts. Oh, five bags.
What a business I'm doin'!
One, two, three, four, five.
50 cents. Right. Here it is.
Peanuts, popcorn.
Hey, Duke. Come here. What's the matter?
The guy threw 50 cents and... Well, look for it.
What's the matter?
Bashful.
What happened? Where did it go? Down the back.
Uh-oh!
Don't look.
Wait a minute. Get her to stand up. Maybe it'll fall out.
Get her to stand up? Sure.
I beg your pardon, madam. Do you mind? Could I get you a better seat?
No, thank you.
I'm very comfortable.
Besides, I paid a dollar for this seat.
You just got
50 cents change.
Come here.
What?
I'll get her to stand up. You get the coin when it drops south.
Okay.
Go ahead, go ahead.
You don't have to stand up.
I'm going downstairs.
Ooh!
Hey, did you get it?
I missed it by a foot. It went down her shoe. What?
I beg your pardon. Are you comfortable? Yes, I am.
If you want to make yourself feel at home, you can take your shoes off.
Listen, if you don't hotfoot it away from here,
I'll call an officer.
- Hey, hotfoot.
- Hotfoot?
Hey, I told you to peddle those peanuts. Now get goin'!
I said get goin'!
Okay, boss.
I hope those vendors weren't annoying you.
They are persistent salesmen.
They may be persistent, but they're not salesmen.
Look out for the manager. I'd like to give him a hotfoot too.
Those fellows burn me up.
Ooowww!
Did you get it?
Ooo-ooo.
Hiya, partner.
There he goes.
He just went...
Don't push.
I'm not pushing.
Don't talk so loud. We don't want to go out till we know we're clear.
Don't push. Get over! I'm not pushing.
Will you get over?
Get over yourself.
Hey, Duke. Quiet. What?
Where did you pick up the fur coat? What fur coat?
Oh, it's a pretty... It's a pretty... Ohhh!
Another five minutes of you signing autographs, I'd have had a nervous breakdown.
No, Miss Anne.!
Miss Anne.
Are you all right? I'm all right.
Nice piece of bulldoggin', miss. Get him out.
Are you hurt,
Miss Anne?
I'm okay, Joe.
Okay.
You sure you're not hurt?
It's just my leg, Ruby.
Mean ol' bull.
I'm terribly sorry.
So you're Bronco Bob, the pride of the West.
You certainly looked it. Any real rider could have sat his horse... and bulldogged that steer himself.
Get out of here before somebody comes.
This young lady may be hurt.
You want to lose that contract?
Tell him to get out of here. If this gets out, he'll be ruined.
Go on, Mr. Mitchell. I wouldn't dream of hurting your career.
Come on, beat it, will ya? Ruby.
Miss Anne! Miss Anne! Let's get her into first aid.
We're sorry you got hurt. It's our fault.
Duke and I were running to hide from the boss... and I let the cow's husband out. He means the bull.
Bull, nothin'.
It's a fact.
That's all right, boys.
It wasn't done intentionally.
Tell one of the attendants to bring up a stretcher. Yes, sir.
She'll be all right. I'll phone the hospital and make arrangements.
Hospital?
Hospital?
I've gotta ride in the finals tonight. Out of the question, miss.
That may be only a sprain, but
I'll have to x-ray to be sure.
The next event, ladies and gentlemen, the finals of the women's trick-riding contest,
America's greatest cowgirls risking life and limb...
for that grand prize of $ 10,000.
Can I come in?
Hiding from your public?
No, and thanks to you
I still have one.
I wanted to tell you how sorry I am that you got hurt.
Any girl would gladly sacrifice her life to save the great Bronco Bob Mitchell.
Everybody tells me that you'd have been a cinch to win that $10,000 prize.
You'd make me feel better if you'd accept this check.
I wasn't sure about the spelling of the name, so I made it out like that.
What's the matter? Afraid that I'll tell someone you're a four-flusher?
I wouldn't dream of disillusioning your public, Mr. Bronco Bob Mitchell.
Now, take your check and get out of here.
Did I just give the works to that Martin Manning!
I made him admit you operated that horse like it was a kiddy car.
How 'bout the girl?
She'll be all right.
You fixed everything?
Yeah, I fixed everything.
That's kind of a tough break for her. Her old man runs a dude ranch.
It meant a lot of customers if she'd won this championship.
Dude ranch? Where? Who cares where?
You're going to Connecticut and start that new story.
I'm gonna finish this one first.
Come on, let's get out of here.
That boy's worried. What makes you think he's worried?
I don't know. He must be. Why?
He just threw away a check for $10,000. Ain't I unlucky.
It wasn't made out to me.
Who was it made out to?
Some guy named "cash. "
- Why, you...
- Hey, you fellas.
The boss!
Come on!
Let's hide in this dark tunnel.
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
Quiet! Don't let them know we're up here.
Ow! What do you mean?
They know I'm here.
Ooh! Ooh!
You!
This goes too.
Let's load the next one.
Hey, boys, you...
Anybody in there?
Nobody but us cows.
Thanks.
Wait!
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah!
Ow! Ow! Ow!
What's the idea?
Oh! Whoa!
Hey, it's a cow!
Hey, what are you guys doing?
We wanna talk to you!
Come here!
They don't seem to be around here.
Well, they went this way.
Hey, Duke.
What?
Look, a train whistle.
Where?
Right here.
Whee! Whee! Whee-whee!
Hey!
What the heck!
No, this way.
Come on.
There they go!
All right, boys, let's get movin'. Okay.
Oh, boy.
Can I help you?
Thanks, pal.
Don't mention it.
Wait a minute!
Come on, get on.
Okay.
Shh. Quiet.
Who put out the lights? Here, here.
Huh? Oh.
That was a narrow escape. You're telling me.
You think we ditched 'em?
Look out the back and find out.
Why don't you? Look out the back door!
Why do you make me do these things? Go ahead.
Okay. Go ahead. What are you afraid of?
Huh?
Nope.
I think we ditched 'em. Swell.
Boy, that was a narrow escape.
What's the matter? What happened? Hey, Duke!
Don't get excited.
We've been shanghaied.
Shanghaied?
What are you doin' with that red flag?
Some dummy left it hangin' up outside. Get rid of it.
What are you playin'?
A little game of poker.
Poker? That's the one game I never played.
I don't know a thing about this game.
I'm so ignorant when it comes to cards.
Never played a game of poker? Nope.
Is this anything like dice? Well, uh, yes.
Sit down.
I'll teach you the game.
I wanna learn.
He's gonna teach me.
Sure, a friendly little game.
First man I find cheatin',
I'll shoot his hat off. Sure.
How many chips do you want? Chips?
You gotta buy chips.
How much do I buy?
How much money have you got? I got some.
What's the matter?
What are you so happy about? I was tickling myself.
That's enough. There you are. No tax?
I'll deal.
Where's your ante?
I beg your pardon?
Where's your ante?
She's home with my uncle.
I didn't know he knew about my relatives. No, no, no.
Feed the kitty. Here, pussy. Here, pussy.
Get me some milk, please.
No, no. Put up like this.
I told you I didn't know anything about poker. Did you open?
I'll stay. What'll you do? Either raise or call.
Call who? The man that made the bet.
Hey, you! No, no, no.
Put a dollar in the pot.
Oh, silly game.
The pot on the table. On the table?
Certainly.
Will you take that off! What are you doing? You told me to!
Hey, you, ante up.
Ante up!
Who you yellin' at? You!
Do I get in these messes.
Excuse me, please.
Sit down.
I didn't know how big you was.
If you was a small guy, I might've said something. Shh.
Look at the size of that guy! Mmm-mmm-mmm. Keep quiet.

Tourists, tourists, tourists.!
Anne!
Dotty!
Where's Dad?
Dad!
Dad!
Darling, thank you.
No, thanks.
Well, how are you? Good as new and twice as fresh.
Sorry I couldn't bring home that prize money.
What happened? It's a long story. Let's go.
I thought it was a short story. Hello.
Oh, Mr. Mitchell.
Careful your train doesn't go off and leave you.
Are you Mr. Mitchell?
Bronco Bob? That's right.
I'm glad to see ya. I got your wire about reservations.
Proud to have you as a guest. Thank you, sir.
A guest?
At the Lazy "S"?
When I told the boys, they were mighty pleased.
They're countin' on pickin' up a few pointers from ya.
Alabam, here she is.
Alabam, how are you?
Swell, now that you're back.
This place seems like a desert without you around.
Oh.
Mr. Mitchell, you must meet
Alabam Brewster, our foreman, and the best rider in this part of the country.
How are you, Mr.
Mitchell? Glad to know you.
He's terrific at bulldogging.
You two should have a lot in common.
Let's go. See you at the ranch.
Welcome home, Miss Anne. Thank you.
The stock's just pullin' in.
I'll give the boys a hand and be right along. All right.
You did all right. I could have done better if...
Duke, real Indians!
We'll be attacked!
Put the freight cars in a circle! Never mind, boy.
Send the pony express. I sell souvenirs. Souvenirs.
He sells souvenirs.
Step over to my shop.
I sell Indian springwater. With every bottle, I give away a bow and arrow.
How do you like that? All my life I wanted a bow and arrow.
I wish I had one now.
I'd knock off a lot of Ind...
You want to get us in trouble with these Indians?
Shush. Don't be scared of any Indians.
You show me one Indian,
I'll show you a coward.
I'm an Indian.
I'm a coward.
Step this way, gentlemen. What's the matter with you? Come on.
Unravel the freight cars. It's safe. Everything's all right.
Look, a real, genuine
Indian bow and arrow.
"Made in Cleveland. " Didn't you ever hear of the Cleveland Indians?
Now stop!
Here, gentlemen.
It'll make you feel good, like rain in the face.
That's what we need.
We could use some.
Buy a jug. That's all you do, put your hand in your pocket.
You never come up with nothin'. Buy a jug!
What am I, the treasurer and everything else? Go ahead.
Very refreshing, huh?
Oh, yeah.
What in the world is this?
Where'd he go?
Over that way.
Oh, boy. That's a fine trick you played on me.
I'll call it even if you'll tell me what those people are talkin' about.
My tribe are saying the man who shoots an arrow... through the tent of an eligible squaw must marry her.
I think it's a very good law.
That law should be all over the country.
You marry her. I don't wanna mar...
You gotta marry her. Not me.
You shot an arrow through the heart of her tepee.
Therefore, you must marry her.
I'll see ya later.
Come along! I don't wanna marry her.
I'm not gonna marry no girl.
She might be beautiful. I don't care. I'm not gonna marry her.
I wouldn't marry the most beautiful girl in the world.
I can be wrong.
Hello.
I'm some marksman. I shot my arrow through your tent.
No, I'm Sunbeam. Your arrow pierced the tent... of my sister, Moonbeam. Moonbeam? Sunbeam?
Hey, Duke, must be twins.
Find out.
I think I will.
Moonbeam!
Yes, sweetheart?
Will there ever be an end to that? She called me sweetheart.
Don't worry, little sister.
We'll have a bow-and-arrow wedding.
A-tisket a-tasket
A brown and yellow basket
I send a letter to my mommy
On the way
I dropped it
I dropped it
I dropped it
Yes, on the way
I dropped it
A little girlie picked it up
And put it in her pocket
She was truckin' on down the avenue
With not a single thing to do
She went a beg, beg, beggin' all around
When she spied it on the ground
She took it
She took it
My little yellow basket
And if she doesn't bring it back
I think that I will die
Oh, gee
I wonder where my basket can be
So do we, So do we
So do we
So do we
So do we
Oh, dear
I wish that little girl
I could see
So do we, So do we
So do we, So do we
So do we!
So do we!
Oh, why was I so careless with that basket of mine
That itty-bitty basket was a joy of mine
A-tisket a-tasket
I lost my yellow basket
Won't someone help me find my basket
And make me happy again again
- Was it red?
- No, no, no, no
- Was it green?
- No, no, no, no
- Was it cerise?
- No, no, no!
Just a little yellow basket
A little yellow basket
What are you doing here? Somebody has to look after you. This idea of yours is crazy.
Hey, boys.
Uh-oh.
You lookin' for me?
We're tryin' to find out where we are. You're at the Lazy "S" Ranch.
Are you lookin' for work? Not if
I can find anything else to do.
Could you use a couple of good men?
Did you ever punch cattle?
I should say not.
I never hit animals.
He's only kidding. That boy is a son of the West.
Oh, really? Reared on the prairie.
He had a saddle for a cradle.
The moos of the cattle was his lullaby. That's right!
Sure. Every time I hear moos I go to sleep.
You boys certainly have a good sense of humor.
Hop over to the bunkhouse and get some work clothes. I'll be in the office.
Thanks a lot.
We've got a job.
What are you waiting for?
Duke, I didn't know cowboys lived in nice houses like this. Sure.
Look at the big bathtub they got!
Never mind the tub.
Look at the girls in it.!
Oh, girls!
Woo!
How do you do? I'm Dotty
Davis, the ranch hostess.
Are you gentlemen taken care of? Everything's dandy.
If I can do anything, just whistle.
Let's grab ourselves a swim. Yeah.
Over here's bathing suits. Come on.
Did you take a shower?
Is there one missing?
Get your suit wet! Oh, get my suit wet.
Here you are.
What's that?
I got it wet. No! Dive in!
Get in the pool. Take advantage of it. Okay.
How deep is it?
Up to my neck.
Okay, here I come.
Take it easy, kid.
I got ya.
Take it easy, girls.
I got ya.
Did I save ya?
Did I save ya?
Ha-ha-ha.
I saved the three...
Are you the guy that told me it was up to my neck?
Yeah. What are you gonna do about it?
Why...
You ever find the guy that stole that shower?
Listen, these people are all watching you.
Go up to that springboard.
They're expecting an exhibition.
Go ahead. He'll be right up there, folks.
All right, folks.
Get up on the board and show the folks how you can dive.
Go on. Don't push. I'm gonna get up.
Well, get up. I mean, after all...
Go ahead, get up.
Go out on the board.
Go ahead.
Champion.
Go ahead, Willoughby.
The folks are waiting.
Get up on the board. Wait a minute! That's enough for me.
Stand still! Get up... Ooo!
Ooo, my head!
Hey, Duke, my head!
Never mind your head.
Hey, Duke!
Get off my fingers!
Get me off here, will ya?
You wanna break that diving board?
Get me off, will ya?
Willoughby, get up.!
What's the matter with you?
Is those pigeons divin' off of me?
Duke! Duke!
What are you all standing around for? He can't swim.!
Willoughby!
Get him out of there.
Willoughby, this is Duke talking.
We'll get him.
Come on,
Willoughby.
Hey, Duke!
Are you all right?
Hey, Duke! Duke!
Come on, yes, yes.
I saw octopuses, all kinds of fishes.
Why didn't you come up?
Nobody told me I had to.
Did I save all those lives? No.
Are them lives I saved? You're all right.
Oh, boy! Willoughby! There he goes again!
Hi, Jack.!
How are you?
Welcome home, Miss Anne.
Thank you. What can we do for you?
I hear you got Bronco Bob
Mitchell stayin' at your place.
That's right. What about it?
The boys'd like to meet him.
Maybe I can arrange it.
Oh, Mr. Mitchell!
Here he comes.
Well, Bronco Bob himself.
Right proud to meet you.
Howdy, Bronco.
How do you do?
Me and the boys rode out to thank you personal-like.
Thank me? Sure, for entering our rodeo,
big event of the Frontier Days Celebration.
We're turning the receipts over to a hospital for kids.
Having a celebrity like you ought to double our take.
Did you enter in a rodeo? He sure did.
Got this telegram a few hours ago.
"My old friend,
Bronco Bob Mitchell,
"wishes me to announce his entry in the broncobusting event...
"of your
Frontier Days Rodeo.
Signed,
Martin Manning. "
Good ol' Manning, always ahead of the news.
It's all on the level?
We can count on you? Bob, wait. You...
It makes a difference in the dough we take in for that hospital.
All right, boys, you can count on me.
Swell, thanks.
Thanks a lot.
So long. See you later, Anne.
Broncobusting! You're beginning to believe your own publicity.
So, you entered the rodeo and decided to represent the Lazy "S."
Now isn't that wonderful! The fact that it's going to keep our outfit... from winning the team prize doesn't matter.
I don't like myself as a phony any more than you do. Then why be one?
All my life
I've tried to be a writer, and all I got was a trunk full of rejection slips... until one day I happened to write a western story.
I wrote more westerns and they clicked too and that was the beginning.
This Bronco Bob buildup was my publisher's idea.
Well, why keep it up?
I can't tell the truth now. There are too many people involved.
There are Bronco Bob toys, souvenirs, all the rest.
A couple hundred people make a living...
out of a guy that doesn't even exist.
I never realized that.
The only reason I came out here is because I had some sort of a crazy idea... that Bob Mitchell might learn to do some things that Bronco Bob is supposed to do...
ifhe had the right teacher. You mean Alabam?
I mean you.
Mr. Mitchell?
As long as you're gonna be on our team,
I thought you'd like to pick the horse you wanna ride.
Uh, right now? We wanna be sure you get the best.
Don't we, honey?
Come along, Bronco.
Oh, bury me not
On the lone... prairie
Where the flyin' fishes
Duke, look! Hey, what are you...
Here, you can have it. What are you doing?
Why don't you look where you're shooting?
I guess I'm not inquisitive.
You don't know what you're doing!
Hey, Duke.
What?
Please don't be mad at me. Why shouldn't I?
Without you,
I don't know what I'd do.
Please, look at me. Don't point that gun at me!
I'm sorry. Going around with a gun in your hand.
I'll fix you. Hold that bullet. Yes, sir.
There you are. Hold these bullets. Hold the bullets!
Put that gun away... and keep away from me!
Hey, Duke,
I swallowed the bullet.
It's my own fault anyway.
I'm always gettin' you into trouble.
I don't know why.
I deserve a good kick in the pants!
Hey, Duke.
Shh, shh!
Hey.
Put that down.
What's the matter with you?
There, take your pick.
Maybe you better not ride today.
There's no time like the present.
Pick that tame-looking one.
I'll take that one right there.
Say, you do know your horseflesh.
That's Wildcat, the toughest piece of bronco I ever roped.
Wildcat!
If he tries to get on a horse again, he's got a lot of nerve.
You're telling me. That guy can't even ride. I know.
Hey, boss.!
Shh.
What's this shushing stuff? If you tell on Bob, I'll tell on you.
What do you mean? You're talking to a real cowboy.
One hot dog, please. Yes, ma'am. Well, so you got me.
We won't tell.
And you?
Not a word.
Gee, thanks.
Hey, you two.
Get busy and rope Wildcat, that little bay.
Can you ride him?
That one?
Yes.
He's talking to you. What about it?
I'm not gonna rope no horse.
You go ahead. Wait a minute.
You want him to think I'm scared? But after all...
Do you want him to think that I'm yellow? No!
I'm not gonna rope that!
Tell you what I'll do.
I'll wait out here. You go in there. Ha-ha-ha-ha.
No, sir. You ain't gonna put that over on me.
Then you go in there and I'll wait out here.
That's better. All right, go ahead. Get going.
Make it snappy. Go on. Get in there.
He's a killer. That's all I wanna know.
What's the matter? The man said he's a killer.
He can't hurt us.
- Borrow my rope, buddy.
- Go ahead, go ahead.
Go ahead, get over there.
Okay.
Throw it!
That's it, get it.
Hey, I got him.
Pull him in. I got him.
I think he's got me.
If I didn't like ya,
I wouldn't let you do this.
Wish you wouldn't like me so much. Pull him in.
Look, look!
Ha-ha-ha-ha.
It's a horse. Take it easy. What is this?
What kind of horse is that? Not that one. Wildcat.
Another one?
The one over there.
Go ahead. What's the matter with you?
Let me through!
Aw, come on.
Pull me through!
Go out and let him know who's boss. He knows who's boss!
Are you trying to show me up in front of these boys? No.
Then go out there. You want me to go there with that wildcat?
Okay, pal. So long, everybody. Not that way!
Will you please... This guy's always in the way.
Take this rope off.
Get over there. Now lasso him. Throw the rope out.
Get outta here.
Do a nice job.
Wait! Take it easy.
You'll choke yourself.
Throw it out.
Get it out, way out.
Hey, boss, I think I missed. I think you did too.
Hey, Duke, save me.!
Save me.! Save me.!
Get him out of there before he gets hurt.
Nice work, pal.
We'll handle him for ya.
Oh-ho-ho!
Ha-ha-ha!
Shut that gate!
Bring him back here.
Hurry up, boys.
Mr. Mitchell, we'll have him ready for you in just a minute.
Hurry up, boys.
That's it.
This is the safest place in the whole corral.
Come on, get down.
Oh, oh, oh!
Get me off!
Hey, Duke...
Whoa, boy! Whoa!
The little guy's plenty good.
Hey, Duke! Duke!
Get me off! Get me off!
- Grab my hand.
- Get me off!
Ya-hoo!
Look at that!
Bring that horse back!
You better get me this time.
I'm gonna come around again.
- Grab my hand.
- Get me off the horse!
How do you turn this thing off?
You all right?
Hey, Bob, get us off.
Come on, Bob. Get us off!
Hold on!
Get me off!
Get me off!
Alabam, they were terrific.!
Nice work. I never realized you were so good.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Hey, Duke... Poor Duke... couldn't take it.
Come on.
Beside the Rio Tonto
On a starlit trail
He fell in love with her smile
One autumn while the moon was pale
And he knew that she loved him
Just by the look that she wore
That evening beside
The Rio Tonto shore
Two hearts were young and happy
Love was all aglow
And as they laughed and they dreamed
The heavens seemed to overflow
Then one day he grew restless
To roam and wander once more
He left her beside
The Rio Tonto shore
He said his love for her would be undying
And he'd return when his wandering was through
But her poor heart whispered sadly he's lying
It's strange how it knew
And yet each night she waits there
On the starlit trail
And prays he'll come back again
Some autumn when the moon is pale
And as each evening passes
She sighs and waits just one more
He'll find her beside
The Rio Tonto shore
There you are, boys.
I guess it's warm now.
Thanks, Ruby.
I never minded a baby before.
Well, is it all right?
It's the right temperature.
I gotta make my own formulas.
It's your work now.
Be nice, take your din-din. Oh, give it to her.
Come on, take your din-din.
Don't be such a hog.
I feel so motherly,
I should have went to Vassar.
Will you shut her up?
Hey, Duke, think there's a pin sticking her? Nah.
I don't think so now.
If you're going someplace, why don't you take me with you?
How would you like to attend another barbecue?
What are you doing here? We moved the tribe down for his wedding to Moonbeam.
I'm too young to be a bride.
Get your trousseau ready.
They let us go, but they sure mean business.
Duke, Duke.
What happened?
They got me.
They what?
They got me. Hey, Duke. No, no, Willoughby!
When you get back to New York, tell the folks
I died with my boots on.
Duke! Don't go away.
All right, Willoughby.
Don't go away! Pull yourself together. I won't!
Were you ever shot?
It's a burning feeling.
I don't mean indigestion.
I know how you feel.
This is awful.
Wait a minute. Twice in the same place I got it.
Duke? It's a couple of cowboys at target practice.
I know...
What's the matter with you? Hmph!
Disappointed, eh?
That's it, that's right.
You've got him.
How long did that take? 43 seconds, you're improving.
Yeah, but not enough. Bob, if you'll just do it like this.
If she don't like him, why's she doing that?
That's love.
Oh, no. Oh, no.
Love is when you're parked in a car.
What do you think?
You're all right.
There's nothing to it.
You expect me to do that? Sure, and better.
It was a great life while it lasted.
Mount from the squaw side, the right.
Well, here we go.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
That's it.
Hold it.
That's it!
Bob!
Bob! Bob!
Are ya hurt?
Oh, Bob.
Bob?
Hi.
You faker!
What are you two doing here?
We're just watching. Yeah, she's teachin' him to...
To what? Two and two make four and four and four make eight.
And eight and eight...
Then there's geography.
Get up to the barn.
It's milkin' time.
Do I have to milk that bunch of cows?
No, not bunch, herd. Heard what?
Herd of cows. Sure, I heard of cows. Think I'm a dummy?
No, a cow herd. What do
I care if a cow heard?
I didn't say anything to be ashamed of.
Do you know what a cow gives?
A cow gives milk.
No, she don't.
You gotta take it away from her. Let's get over to the barn.
What are you doing down there?
Tryin' to do this.
Don't lean on me!
Don't lean on me!
There must be a better way.
Can you move her over?
Move the stuff over.
Get off the finger!
Duke, she's on my hand.
Get it out. Get it out! Get it out!
Get it out yourself.
You milk her from the back.
From the back?
Certainly, not down there.
Cowboy! You've got to learn sometime.
Now what are you doing? There's none of those things up here.
Duke, give me a pail.
Will you listen to me?
You milk her on the stool. Oh, on the stool?
On the stool.
Now I know.
Get off there. Here. Stool.
Sit down.
Huh?
Not you, the cow.
What for?
I'm gonna milk her. No, no, no, here, put that under the udder.
The other what?
The cow's udder.
Cow's other what?
Under here, please!
Sit down there. Milk the cow.
You mean under the crankcase.
All right, call it what you want. Get some milk.
Get some milk.
No?
Come on, come on, give me some milk.
Hey, you! Come on! Get in line!
I was here first.
What are you trying to do?
Why don't you pick on somebody your size? I was here first.
I'm tryin' to get some milk myself, you know.
After all!
Must have run dry.
Don't look at me. It ain't my fault. First time I come here.
Hey, Duke! Duke, Duke. What's the matter?
Help me milk this cow. No, this is a steer. A steer don't give milk.
No?
No!
Where does "steeralized" milk come from? Make it snappy.
I'm dying for a drink of raw milk. Okay.
All you get in restaurants is
"A" milk and "B" milk. Bee milk?
Do bees give milk?
No, honey.
Thanks, dear. Oh, come on, get with it.
Oooh! A four-tube set.
How do you tune it in?
You can never trust a woman, can ya?
Will ya cut it out?
Dare ya to do it once more.
She did.
Give me somethin'.
You do it once more
I'll...
Once more...
I guess that'll hold ya.
Oh!
This is a fine time to be sleeping.
Come on, get up.
Come on, wake up.
What's the matter? What happened? Come on.
What's the matter with you?
Peanuts! Hot dogs! Milk!
Uh-oh!
That's trouble.
Wait a minute.
This looks bad.
"We've got the Indian sign on you.
Get a wedding license ready or else!"
Or else? I'm gettin' sick and tired of havin' Indians threaten me.
I'll give 'em 10 minutes to get out of town.
How long? I'll give 'em five minutes to get out of town.
How long? Give me 10 seconds and I'll be packed.
Are you gonna let them get away with that? No!
That's a boy. I'll get those dirty redskins!
I knew it was in ya. Which way did these arrows come from?
That way! That way? Let's... go this way!
This lovely day has lengthened
Into evening
We'll sigh good-bye
To all we've ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April
And be glad
I'll be content
You loved me once in April
Your lips were warm
And love and spring were new
But I'm not afraid of autumn
And her sorrow
For I'll remember
April and you
The fire will dwindle
Into glowing ashes
For flames and love live
Such a little while
I won't forget
But I won't be lonely
I'll remember April
And I'll smile
The fire will dwindle
Into glowing ashes
For flames and love live such a little while
I won't forget
But I won't be lonely
I'll remember April
And I'll smile
This ought to scare the daylights out of'em. It better.
I spent the best part of the day carvin' that face. Rush it up.
Over here, across from his bunk. Here they come!
It's dark in here.
Put on the lights.
They got me. They got me. Where?
Right in the middle of the excitement.
Somebody's tryin' to kid you.
Funny kind of kiddin'. Every time
I turn around you know what happens?
What? Some Indian lets go with an arrow... right by my kisser.
Come on, let's go to bed.
Hiya, partner.
Duke! Duke!
What's the matter?
It's only a dummy.
Look at it!
Those three boys put that there to scare you.
They're very successful.
Touch it. It's only a dummy.
Feel it.
That's all there is to it.
Come on, let's wash up.
I'm not scared of you.
Willoughby, go get me the soap.
Go get me the soap.!
Go get it yourself!
Willoughby, go get me the soap.!
I'm not gonna get it.! No.!
Go get me the soap, Willoughby.!
All right.
That's better.
Dummy, eh?
I wish you was the other guy you look like.
I'd let you have it.
Mmm!
Fine joint. Ain't even a place to hang your hat.
I mean...
A knife, zip, right through my hat.
That's ridiculous.
No.! Come on, come on.!
Hey, Duke!
It was right...
What do you know?
What do you know...
There's your hat and there's no knife in it. No?
That hole wasn't put there by a moth.
Come here, I'll prove this Indian is only a dummy.
Get over here.
What are you afraid of?
Look. Look.
Now get with it and go to bed.
No more of this nonsense.
Dummy, huh?
You look like a guy that gave me Indian springwater.
The roof's leakin'.
I'd have sworn that guy moved.
Did you move?
No.
I'll fix you.
Put this in your mouth.
That's good. I'm gettin' hysterical or something.
I don't know.
It's only a dummy.
No dummy's gonna do that...
Come here. No, I don't want to go in.
I'm tellin' ya, he's alive.
I saw the thing...
What got into you all of a sudden?
What are you afraid of? I'm tellin' you this Indian's alive.
He done an awful lot of things to me. You're crazy, it's impossible.
I'll show ya.
Go ahead, show me.
Now what?
What are you doing?
Nothin'.
It didn't work.
See him take a kick at me. That's a dummy, dummy.
Well, he's alive.
Go on, get in bed.
What's the matter with you all of a sudden?
That's no way to act. Get into your nightgown and get some rest.
Where are you going? I'm gonna change in the closet.
I'm bashful. All right, go ahead in the closet.
What kept you? I was a little long, wasn't I?
Certainly, get to bed.
I'll turn out the lights.
I don't want to hear of
Indians from you anymore.
Understand?
Get in there.
Don't mention Indians. That's all I do is think of'em.
I'm always dreamin' of'em.
Think of something else.
Beautiful girls. I'll think of beautiful girls, but I'll dream about Indians. Go to sleep.
How do you do?
Something wrong?
Sanitarium? You the doctor? That's right.
Gotta have some rest.
I need a lot of rest.
All night long when I sleep I see Indians.
Even when I turn around,
I bump into Indians.
I gotta have rest. You've come to the right place.
You'll see no Indians here.
Everything will be all right.
Just a minute, just a minute. Take it easy.
You're in bad shape.
You do need a rest.
Wait, I'll see what
I can do for you.
Fellas, do you mind giving this room up for tonight?
Come this way, please.
Come, come.
Come on. Take it easy.
That's the boy. Oh, nurse? Yes?
This is your nurse.
Another Indian. You an Indian?
You must be seeing things.
He's in bad shape.
Make sure everything is quiet.
I gotta have rest. Hang your clothes up and get some sleep.
You'll be all right in the morning. If you need me, just call.
What a beautiful bed of roses.
I think I'll water them.
That's enough, that's enough.
That's enough!
That's plenty!
I'm gettin' plenty of rest tonight anyway.
Bite the dust!
I won't!
You will. You will. I won't. I won't.
Oooooh!
Come in at once! Water! Pocahontas fainted.
Fainted? Yes, John Smith ran away with Minnehaha.
Phone for water!
Phone for water?
I'll help you, kids. I'll phone.
I don't like to see nobody faint.
Oh, boy, Pocahontas fainted.
I want some water.
And I got it too.
- Bite the dust.!
- I won't.!
- You will.!
- I won't.!
Oooooh.!
I got him... with my finger.
Didn't work.
Run out of bullets.
That's enough.
Enough for me.
What are you doing?
You want to shoot me?
Would you like to have your palm read?
Hee-hee-hee-hee!
General Custer.!
Sitting Bull.!
Duke! Duke! Hey, Duke!
Wake up, will ya? Yeah?
I'm scared.
What's the matter?
The whole room is full of Indians. Where, where?
I saw two guys come in.
"Bite the dust. " "I won't!"
The other guy shot him!
Bang! Took him out!
Come here, come here!
You've been dreaming.
What is it all about? A flock of Indians all over the room!
What do you mean, flock of
Indians? Plenty of Indians.
There's not a single Indian here. Oh, no?
No! I know, they're married and got children.
What are you talkin' about? Everybody was in the room, but that one that throws knives.
Remember the hat? Are you still afraid of that?
Afraid? You think he's still around?
I'll prove to you he's not.
Come here, come here.
He's not here.
He's not here.
He's not here.
He's not here.
He's not here.
If I know you, you're gonna do one of two things.
You're gonna break her heart or your neck.
Either way, you're gonna break my pocketbook.
Mr. Mitchell?
Yeah?
I'm Ace Anderson. How are ya? Mr. Conway, my nursemaid.
How are you?
Good evening.
I own a club downtown and I haven't seen you around.
I've been busy getting ready for the rodeo.
Sam Shaw figures the Lazy "S" team is a cinch to win with you on it.
I'm handling a $1,000 bet for him.
Mr. Shaw didn't strike me as being a betting man.
He isn't as a rule, but he spent so much money remodeling this place,
I guess he's counting on getting some of it back.
I'll be seeing you down at the club. Good-bye.
Mr. Anderson!
Look out, that guy didn't come just to talk.
I know it.
Yeah? I'll handle Mr.
Shaw's bet myself at 10-to-1.
10-to-1? That's right, but my name's got to be kept out of it.
It's a deal.
Hey, wait a minute.
Aren't you riding for the Lazy "S" team? Uh-huh.
You're betting $10,000 that your own team loses? That's right.
That makes it simpler, doesn't it?
I'll be seeing ya.
You know what that guy thinks? Let him think it.
Ten thousand smackers. You go and kill yourself in that rodeo... just to make sure her old man wins that dough.
I give up.
Hey, Duke, you know what?
I would love to dance.
Why don't you? I gotta learn how to do those kind of dances.
Go on out and do it.
I'd like to.
Go ahead.
You know the last...
Hey, Duke, I've been robbed. What's the matter?
I've been robbed. In here? You've been robbed?
I had it when I left the bunkhouse. You had what?
My other leg! I want to dance with the girls like everybody else.
Your other leg?
I only got one leg!
What are ya talkin' about? What do you know?
Am I happy?
You should be.
Hello. Do you dance?
Why, yes.
You have nice weather for it. Sit down.
What's on your mind, Ace?
I just wanted you to know... that I bet 20 grand of my own money that the Lazy "S" loses tomorrow.
Why tell me? Well, see that you don't happen to win any events.
You ought to speak to Bronco
Bob Mitchell. He's the headman.
I'm not worried about him.
He'll see that they lose.
Bob Mitchell had me bet
10 grand at 10-to-1... that the Lazy "S" outfit loses.
That's where I got my information.
Ace, I think you're lying.
Whether you are or not, I'm riding to win and no one's gonna stop me.
Same old couples forward and back
Forward again and sides dividing
You swing in the center and you swing on the side
With an Alabama left to the old left hand and back
We got orders from Ace to take you with us.
Here we go with the old mess wagon and a hind wheel broke
And the axle draggin'
Meet your partner, promenade
You know where and I don't care
Hey, what kind of old-fashioned jive is that you've got
Take it from me, pops
It's not so hot
You say it's an old square dance affair
Well, you're right there
It sure is square
Don't be a chump Do a square dance but make it jump
What you say we all go rockin' and reelin'
Make the old Virginia reel really hop
The corn will thrive if you plant it in jive
I'll bet that it pops your top
Hit the timber and go rockin' and reelin'
Do the boogie if the beat is in eight
You're just nowhere if you dance in a square
'Cause you'll swing like a rusty gate
Put rhythm to your do-si-doin'
It's easy to make it mix
Keep jumpin' when you're heel and toein'
If you really want to get your kicks
Swing your partner when you're rockin' and reelin'
Do your dancin' like you haven't a care
You'll be first class
You'll be cookin' with gas
If you go rockin' round the square
Ruby, Ruby
We want Ruby
She's the gal on the mellow side
Ruby, come on, Ruby, just let rhythm be your guide
Give the calls
Make 'em up
Do it in jive and break 'em up
Well, if you want me to do it I'll have these cats come on fit to kill
And we'll show you how they rock the square back in Harlem on Sugar Hill
Now if you really want to get your boots laced
Start out with the old shim-sham
And play back that jive
I laid on you, pops
You're on your own
So cut out and jam
What ya say we all go rockin' and reelin'
Make the old Virginia reel really hop
The corn will thrive if you plant it in jive
I'll bet it pops your top
Hit the timber go rockin' and reelin'
Do the boogie-woogie if the beat is in eight
You're just nowhere if your dancin' is square
'Cause you swing like a rusty gate
Put rhythm to your do-si-doin' It's easy to mix
Keepjumpin'when you're heelin'and toein'if you want to get your kicks
Swing your partner Go rockin' and reelin' like you haven't a care
You'll be first class
You'll be cookin'with gas
Heelin', toein' Rock, rock rockin' 'n' reelin'
Rock, rock rockin' 'n' reelin'
When you're rockin' around the square
But, Miss Anne, that's what that fella told Alabam.
That's true, 'cause I heard it with my one good ear. This one...
This one over here.
This one over here.
I don't believe it. Bob wouldn't bet against himself.
Then why not ask Alabam? Oh, no.
Morning, everybody.
Uh-oh, there he is.
Why you, I ought to haul off and give you the dirtiest look you ever had in your life.
What is this? What's going on? Bob, did you make a bet through Ace
Anderson that the Lazy "S" would lose?
Oh, you heard?
Listen, I'm gonna ride today and I'm gonna ride to win.
As far as I'm concerned, you can do all your riding on a train heading east.
Now listen...
I want to...
What are you doing?
Hey, wait a minute, you guys got a customer. Let's get going.
You don't understand. Oh, yes, we do. You're a bad boy!
You got me wrong. Oh, no!
We ain't got you wrong.
If I got you wrong, I hope I knock a fender off this car.
Okay, get in.
We're wrong.
So that's why I wanted to lose the money.
Ten thousand buckaroos to win a girl? That's love, all right.
That's inflation. It's all your fault. You had to spoil a romance.
You and your eavesdropping. Eavesdropping?
I never dropped an eave in my life.
I ought to give you back to the Indians. Anything but that!
What do you know? Somebody must be usin' a slingshot.
Sit still.
I'll get it.
All right, reach.
Come on, give me your gun.
What's the big idea? Take it easy and you won't get hurt.
I'll go get help!
Ooo-ooo-ooo!
I don't care what your reasons were for betting on the Lazy "S" to lose.
I can be positive they don't win by holding you and Alabam.
Yeah, we got you good,
Bronco Bob.
It ain't as easy to escape from here as it was in them books of yours.
Why? Are you a fan of mine? I'll say I am.
You know that book, I Escaped from Outlaws? That was swell.
Remember, Ace,
I was readin'it to you.
That took place in a cabin like this, didn't it? Yeah, it did.
There I was, a prisoner. The outlaw chief was pacing up and down.
The window was open.
Now let's see...
Come on!
Help!
Hey, you're hurt. Never mind that. Let's get back to the rodeo.
Let's make sure our friend stays here first.
I gotta get help. We should have stayed and fought it out with them.
Hey, hey, look!
Stop, stop, stop.
Look! Look!
Oh, just Indians.
Come on, get going!
Come on, step on it! Go ahead, step on it! Go away.
Come on, they're getting closer.
Way back!
They have no brakes!
Attaboy,
Willoughby!
Come on, step on it!
Hey, take off your brake!
Take off your brake!
Take off the brake?
Take off your brake!
Take it off. Take it off! What do I do now?
Release it!
Okay!
Here they come!
Don't let go of the wheel!
Willoughby, grab the wheel.!
What did you let go of the wheel for?
I can't drive!
What's the matter?
All right, I'll take care of everything.
What's the matter?
What are you doing?
Hey, DiMaggio got another hit.
Put that down!
Ooo-ooo-ooo!
Hey, look, no hands! No, don't!
Something wrong?
See my hat?
No.
There it is.
Thank you.
We got rid of the Indians.
Look out!
Sunday driver! Never mind him.
Your troubles are behind you.
Hey, wait a minute.!
Oh, boy, that...
There they are again.
Go ahead!
Oh, fluid drive.
Hey.! Who's chasing who?
Boy, was that a close shave. You said it.
Faster, faster.
Keep it going.
Go get help, go get help!
Come here, come here!
You went the wrong way!
This way! Hurry up!
Hey! I didn't see that! Get it out!
Hey, Duke, does this place look familiar to you?
Ya dope! We're right back at the spot we started from!
Ain't I uncanny? You are. Now listen to me.
Take the turns I tell ya to take.
Bob's in trouble. Now get going.
Let's see who's in this broncobusting contest.
I don't suppose there's any doubt of his showing up, is there, Conway?
This is dull stuff, Manning. What do you say we go find some real fun?
The next event is the girls'fancy-riding contest.
Good luck, there's a lot more at stake than the prize money.
A lot more? Yeah, Ace Anderson had somebody put up $10,000 that we'd lose.
Ten thousand do...
Why, Dad, then Bob...
Bob wanted to lose so we'd win. That doesn't make sense.
It certainly does.
Come on!
Hey, come on! Hey, Alabam! Get in the car.
He's hurt. Oh, it's nothing.
It's just a little...
Oooooh!
Blood.
The Lazy "S" outfit's in second place with 27 points, including the first place won by Miss Anne Shaw.
And now the final contestant in broncobustin', also representing the Lazy "S" Ranch, that celebrated personality,
Bronco Bob Mitchell.
Where's Bob? Has anyone seen him? No!
Alabam hasn't shown up either.
That's strange.
Anne?
You don't mean that you want Bob to ride? Of course I want him to ride.
Bronco Bob Mitchell is wanted at the chutes. Judges are waiting.
He was gonna ride, was he?
Bronco Bob Mitchell, having failed to appear, the contest is forfeited.
The winner is...
But wait, here he is!
Where have you been? Get
Alabam to first aid right away.
What happened to him? He got shot. I'll explain later.
Look, about that bet... We know all about that. You get in there and ride!
Ride 'em, cowboy!
We win! We win!
We win!
Hello, bridegroom.
Ride 'em, cowboy ride
We're all together side by side
All good men and every one a rooting tooting son of a gun
Come on and ride 'em, cowboy ride
Bust 'em high and wide
And when our pay's been roped and tied
We'll be off to paint the town to set 'em up and drink 'em down
Come on and ride 'em, cowboy ride
Give me a life out on the plains, a horse with lightning in his veins
And for my comrades the men of the West
A cowboy's friends are rough and tough but they're his friends and that's enough
They're tried and true men and they're the best
So ride 'em, cowboy ride
We're all together side by side
They're all good men and every one a rooting tooting son of a gun
Come on and ride 'em, cowboy ride
Bust 'em high and wide
And when our pay's been roped and tied
We'll be off to paint the town to set 'em up and drink 'em down
We're gonna ride 'em, cowboy ride
TELEGRAM
FOR MISS CAMERON.
NAT, WE'RE LATE,TERRIBLY LATE.
RIGHT.
TELEGRAM FOR ME?
NO, FOR MISS LUTIE.
I'LL TAKE IT UP TO HER.
MISS LUTIE UP IN HER ROOM?
THEY'RE ALL UP THERE.
WOULDN'T YOU THINK
THEY'D GET TIRED
OF LOOKING AT THEMSELVES?
WEDDINGS!
I'LL BE SO GLAD WHEN IT'S OVER.
HURRY UP, RACHAEL.

IT AIN'T TILL 3 DAYS.
RACHAEL, HAVE YOU

LUTIE?
ONE MINUTE, FATHER!
LET HIM IN, RACHAEL.
YOU LOOK FINE.
THEN SMILE!
- SMILE?
YOU HAVEN'T SMILED
ONCE SINCE I GOT ENGAGED.
WHY, LUTIE, I...
THE TWO LONGEST THINGS
IN ST. LOUIS-
YOUR FACE AND THE
MISSISSIPPI RIVER.
WELL, I ONLY WANT
YOUR HAPPINESS, LUTIE.
AND I JUST KEEP THINKING
ONE THING:
JIM BREWTON IS ALL RIGHT.
HE'S GREAT IN SALT FORK
TERRITORY OF NEW MEXICO
AND YOU'RE ALL RIGHT
IN ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI.
STOP IT, DARLING.
AND THEN I THINK OF
THE TWO OF YOU TOGETHER,
AND NEITHER PLACE-
I KNOW IT'S GOING
TO BE RIGHT.
AND, LUTIE, SUCH A
A SHORT COURTSHIP.
A COWMAN!
BUT SUCH A COWMAN.
REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID
WHEN YOU INTRODUCED US.
THAT'S RIGHT,
I DID INTRODUCE YOU.
HERE'S A TELEGRAM
FOR YOU.
OH, THANKS.
IT'S PROBABLY FROM HIM.
HE MUST HAVE LEFT.
HE SAID HE'D WIRE
THE MINUTE HE GOT
ON THE TRAIN.
DELAYED. CAN'T-
GET TO ST. LOUIS FCR WEDDING.
TAKE FIRST TRAIN
BE MARRIED HERE. LOVE, JIM.
WELL!
FATHER, THIS IS NOT FUNNY.
WELL, YOU ASKED ME
TO SMILE, DIDN'T YOU?
YOU DONE IT-
TRAIN'S EARLY, 3/4 OF AN HOUR!
AND 33 SECONDS.
I GOT A STOPWATCH.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
IF SAM DOESN'T MEET YOU?
DON'T WORRY.
YOU HEARD THE CONDUCTOR-
TRAIN'S EARLY.
YOUR MAN AIN'T
SHOWED UP, NEITHER.
SAMMY!
SAMMY!
- SELINA!
HELLO, SPROUT.
YOU'VE GROWED!
REGULAR BUSTER,
AIN'T SHE?
SAM, THIS IS
LUTIE CAMERON.
WE KEPT EACH OTHER COMPANY
ON THE ROAD OUT.
SHE SPELLED ME WITH MOLLY.
HAPPY TO KNOW YOU, SAM.
I'VE HEARD
A LOT ABOUT YOU.
NO MORE THAN I HEARD
OF HER MAN.
MAYBE I KNOW HIM.
HOMESTEADER?
CATTLEMAN.
- OH.
NAME OF JIM BREWTON.
COLONEL BREWTON?
- MM-HMM.
YES, I KNOW HIM.
I SURE THANK YOU FOR HELPING
THE WIFE OUT, MA'AM.
COME ON, HONEY.
ALL RIGHT, SAM.
GOODBYE, LUTIE.
GOODBYE, SELINA.
GOOD LUCK TO YOU.
WE'LL SEE EACH OTHER.
BE A GOOD GIRL,
BUTTON-NOSE.
THERE'S A-A HOTEL?
SURE. EXCHANGE HOUSE
OVER THERE.
THANK YOU.
COLONE BREWTON WILL
CALL FOR THIS LUGGAGE.
YES, MA'AM.
I'M SORRY
TO DISTURB YOU
BUT WILL YOU
HELP ME, PLEASE?
OH, THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.
I'LL BE A SON OF A GUN.
I BEG YOUR PARDON?
I SAID,
I'M A SON OF A GUN.
IT ISN'T POSSIBLE. OF COURSE NOW,
IS IT? - WHAT?
THAT YOU ARE MISS LUTIE CAMERON
OF ST. LOUIS AND POINTS EAST.
SHE ARRIVES ON THE 3:00.
THEY'RE SENDING UP
ROCKETS THEN.
THE TRAIN WAS EARLY.
TRUST JIM BREWTON
TO PICK A WOMAN
WITH HAIR THE COLOR
OF CHILI PEPPER.
WELL, DON'T WORRY,
I LIKE IT.
WELL, IF YOU KNOW COLONEL
BREWTON, YOU CAN HELP ME.
EVERYBODY KNOWS JIM BREWTON,
SOME TO THEIR SORROW.
YOUR IMPENDING ARRIVAL
HAS CREATED QUITE A STIR
IN SALT FORK,
MISS CAMERON.
BREATHS HAVE BEEN
WELL-BATED.
I SHALL NOW BATE MINE AGAIN.
YOU'RE MAKING THE MISTAKE
OF YOUR LIFE, YOU KNOW.
THERE'S A TRAIN OUT
OF HERE TOMORROW.
IF I WERE YOU,
I'D BE ON IT.
WHO ARE YOU, ANYWAY?
THE NAME'S BRICE CHAMBERLAIN.
HOWEVER, "WHAT," NOT "WHO,"
IS THE IMPORTANT THING.
I, MISS CAMERON,
AM AN IDEALIST-
A PRACTICING IDEALIST.
LOOK AROUND YOU,
MISS CAMERON.
YOU'RE OUT OF PLACE.
THE WINE OF THE COW COUNTRY
IS REDEYE, NOT CHAMPAGNE.
REDEYE...
- REDEYE.
A VERY INFERIOR
BRAND OF WHISKEY.
NEVER TOUCH
THE STUFF MYSELF.
UNDERSTAND BREWTON
DOES, THOUGH.
I SHOULD BE VERY ANGRY.
I GUESS I AM.
ON THE OTHER HAND, MAYBE I'M NOT.
I DON'T KNOW.
THIS IS SUCH
A PLACE.
COME ON, MR. CHAMBERLAIN,
JURY'S COMING IN.
WE BETTER GET OVER THERE.
BREWTON AIN'T SHOWED UP YET.
SURE, ANDY. MEET YOU
AT THE COURTHOUSE.
IS THAT WHERE COLONEL BREWTON IS,
AT THE COURTHOUSE?
THAT'S WHERE I LEFT HIM.
WHY, YOU'RE HIS ENEMY,
AREN'T YOU?
HIS NATURAL ENEMY.
WE'RE MAKING HISTORY IN SALT FORK
TODAY, MISS CAMERON.
I HOPE IT WILL BE
THE RIGHT KIND.
IF BREWTON HAS HIS WAY
IT WON'T BE.
QUIET DOWN, FOLKS,
QUIET DOWN!
QUIET IN THE COURTHOUSE, BOYS.
THE COURT'S IN SESSION NOW.
GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY
HAV E YOU REACHED A DECISION?
YES, SIR, WE HAVE-
UNANIMOUS.
HOW FIND YOU?
ARE THE DEFENDANTS GUILTY
OR NOT GUILTY?
WE FIND THAT
ANDY BOGGS HERE
WAS SHOT AND RUN OFF
THE LAND HE FILED ON
BY PARTIES UNKNOWN.
WELL, THAT VERDICT
DON'T SETTLE ANYTHING.
HOW ABOUT
THE DEFENDANTS HERE-
IKE RANDALL
AND BILL ROACH?
YOU MEAN, THE BOYS
WHAT DONE THE SHOOTIN'?
THEY AIN'T GUILTY.
DEFENDANTS RELEASED.
COURT'S ADJOURNED!
JUST ONE MOMENT,
GENTLEMEN!
THIS TRIAL'S OVER, BUT AS
ATTORNEY FOR THE PLAINTIFFS,
THERE ARE STILL A FEW
THINGS STICKING IN MY CRAW.
SWALLOW QUICK,
AND MAYBE THEY'LL GO AWAY.
COLONEL BREWTON, I WONDER,
NOW THAT WE'VE LOST
IF YOU'D OBLIGE ME
BY ANSWERING A FEW QUESTIONS.
LET'S SAY, AS A SPORTING
PROPOSITION.
TROUBLE WITH YOU IS,
YOU DON'T KNOW WHEN YOU'RE LICKED.
NO, HE DOESN'T, MAC.
WE'LL HAVE TO GIVE HIM THAT.
ALL RIGHT, SIR
GO AHEAD.
JUST REMEMBER, I'VE GOT A
3 O'CLOCK TRAIN TO MEET.
THANK YOU,
I'LL BE BRIEF.
COLONEL BREWTON,
HOW MUCH CATTLE RANGE DO YOU CONTROL?
I'VE HEARD IT RUNS
INTO A MILLION OR MORE ACRES.
I'VE NEVER COUNTED THEM.
THEN AGAIN, I'VE HEARD
THAT IT'S 100 SQUARE MILES.
IN ANY CASE YOU WILL ADMIT
THAT'S A LOT OF LAND FOR ONE MAN.
WELL, I RUN A LOT OF COWS.
IS IT TRUE THAT OF THIS
VAST AMOUNT OF PROPERTY
YOU ACTUALLY OWN ONLY
A FEW SCATTERED WATER HOLES
THAT ARE FILED ON
EITHER IN YOUR NAME
OR THOSE OF YOUR MEN?
AND THAT BY FAR
THE GREATER PART OF IT
STILL BELONGS
TO THE GOVERNMENT.
LEGALLY, YES.
IS IT TRUE, THEN THAT
MILLION OR MORE ACRES
STILL BELONGING
TO THE GOVERNMENT,
IS THE SAME LAND FROM
WHICH ANDREW BOGGS
WHO MERELY WANTED 160 ACRES
FOR A HOMESTEAD.
WAS RUN OFF AND
SEVERELY WOUNDED
BY PARTIES UNKNOWN.
BOGGS WAS NOT
RUN OFF BECAUSE
HE WANTED TO SETTLE
THE 160 ACRES
BUT BECAUSE OF WHAT
HE WANTED TO DO WITH THE LAND.
LET'S FORGET
ABOUT THIS CASE.
ANDREW BOGGS IS ONLY
A SINGLE MAN,
AND THE COURT HAS
ALREADY DISPOSED OF HIM.
BUT WAITING AT
THE EDGE OF SALT FORK
TO HEAR THE OUTCOME OF THIS TRIAL
ARE OTHER SETTLERS.
MEN WITH FAMILIES,
WHO'VE DRIVEN THEIR WAGONS
MORE THAN 1,000 MILES
ACROSS THE PLAINS
AND LEFT THEIR DEAD
FROM THE MISSISSIPPI
TO THE RIO GRANDE
ALL WITH ONE PURPOSE-
TO FIND HOMES
FOR THEMSELVES IN THIS GREAT TERRITORY.
I WANT TO ASK IN THE NAMES
OF THESE FAMILIES
IF YOU WON'T LET THEM SETTLE
UNDISTURBED ON A FEW ACRES
OUT OF THE MILLIONS OR MORE
OF GOVERNMENT LAND ON YOUR RANGE.
CHAMBERLAIN, I HAVE SYMPATHY
FOR THE EARLY PIONEER
WHO CAME OUT HERE
AND RISKED HIS LIFE
AND HIS FAMILY'S
AMONG THE INDIANS,
AND I HOPE I HAVE A LITTLE CHARITY
FOR THE NESTOR
WHO WAITED UNTIL THE COUNTRY
WAS SAFE AND PEACEABLE
BEFORE HE FILED HIS HOMESTEAD
ON THE RANGE
OF SOMEONE ELSE WHO
HAD FOUGHT FOR IT.
BUT WHEN THAT NESTOR PICKS
LAND LIKE MY BIG VEGA,
WHICH IS 7000 FEET ABOVE THE SEA
WHICH WAS NATURALLY
INTENDED FOR
GRAZING LAND, AND ALWAYS WILL
BE GRAZING LAND,
WHEN HE WANT TO PLOW IT UP
TO SUPPORT HIS FAMILY
WHERE THERE ISN'T ENOUGH RAIN
FOR THE CROPS TO GROW,
WHEN HE ONLY KILLS
THE GRASS THAT WILL GROW,
AND THEN, WHEN HIS CROPS
STARVE FOR WATER,
SUPPORTS HIS FAMILY
BY KILLING MY BEEF,
AND BECOMES A MAN WITHOUT
RESPECT TO HIMSELF
AND A MENACE
TO THE TERRITORY,
THEN I HAVE NEITHER SYMPATHY
NOR CHARITY.
AND IF I KNOW THE TEMPER
OF THE PEOPLE AROUND HERE
WHAT ANDY BOGGS GOT
IS JUST A SAMPLE OF
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF OTHERS
TRY IT.
THEY TOLD ME THERE WAS
NO JUSTICE HERE
AND THAT YOU DOMINATED
THE COUNTRY.
THEY WERE RIGHT.
WELL, WE WON, JIM.
BOYS, I'VE GOT A TRAIN TO MEET.
JIM! JIM!
JIM!
PARDON, PARDON.
JIM, THE TRAIN
BROKE A RECORD.
I'LL MAKE UP FOR THAT LATER.
OH, I WANT YOU TO MEET A FRIEND
OF MINE, DOC REID.
HOW DO YOU DO?
- THIS IS JUDGE WHITE.
HOW DO YOU DO?
- HOW DO YOU DO?
FLOYD McCURTIN.
HOW DO YOU DO?
- HOW DO YOU DO?
WELL, WE WON, DIDN'T WE?
WHATEVER IT WAS.
WE HAD TO.
DID WE, JIM?
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
WE WON TODAY,
BUT I DIDN'T LIKE
THAT BEAT LOOK
IN ANDY BOGGS' EYES.
YOU GET ENOUGH MEN LOOKING
LIKE THAT..
WELL, I DON'T LIKE
WHAT I SEE COMING.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
OH, THE DOC-
HE DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.
YOU'LL GET TO KNOW THE DOC.
I HOPE I GET TO KNOW ALL
OF YOU.
AND THAT YOU'RE
GOING TO LIKE ME
AS WELL AS I'M GOING
TO LIKE YOU.
THERE YOU ARE, BOYS,
DO YOU SEE NOW WHY I DID IT?
SURE DO. BUT NOW WE'RE WONDERING
WHY YOU WAITED SO LONG.
COME ON.
SUCH A HURRY, JIM.
6:00 IN THE MORNING.
COME ON. YOU'LL BE THE FIRST WOMAN
IN THE TERRITORY
EVER MARRIED IN HER SLEEP.
WE MADE IT.
WHAT DID WE MAKE, JIM?
WHERE ARE WE?
THE GREATEST PLACE I KNOW.
COME ON.
THERE IT IS.
IT'S ALL GRASS.
YEAH.
WELL, IT'S JUST...
IT'S SO EMPTY,
SO QUIET.
QUIET?
MORE NOISE OUT THERE
THAN THERE IS IN ST. LOUIS.
I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING.
WELL, YOU HAVE TO LISTEN FOR IT
BEFORE YOU CAN.
I'M LISTENING, JIM.
ALL I HEAR IS THAT LITTLE
WHISTLE OF A SOUND.
THE WIND?
THERE'S A LOT MORE
THAN THAT OUT THERE.
TELL ME, JIM-WHAT?
WELL...
NO, PLEASE TELL ME.
I'LL TRY TO UNDERSTAND.
WHAT DO YOU HEAR
OUT THERE?
WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
I GUESS I HEAR THE BUFFALO.
BUFFALO? BUT THEY AREN'T
THERE ANYMORE.
THAT'S RIGHT.
OH. WHAT ELSE, JIM?i
INDIANS.
GONE, TOO?
HERDED INTO
A RESERVATION.
I CAN REMEMBER THE FIRST
TIME I SAW HER.
WE'D COME A LONG WAY
AND NOBODY WAS TELLING US
ABOUT ANY SURPRISES, EITHER.
WE JUST CAME OVER THE HILL
AND THERE SHE WAS
SORT OF LYING THERE ALL ALONE.
NOBODY WANTED HER THEN...
EXCEPT THE ANTELOPE AND THE BUFFALO
AND THE INDIANS.
SO WE TOOK HER, AND WE SET HER UP
RIGHT FOR COW COUNTRY.
WE FOUGHT FOR HER.
OUR BLOOD'S SUNK
IN EVERY MILE.
INDIAN BLOOD, TOO.
I'M NOT SO PROUD
OF SOME OF THAT.
MY BROTHER'S OUT THERE.
I SUPPOSE I SOUNDED HARD
TO YOU BACK AT THE TRIAL
AND TO EVERYBODY ELSE.
AND I SUPPOSE IT'S HARD
TO UNDERSTAND
THAT ALL THAT OUT THERE
IS ANYTHING BUT JUST A LOT OF GRASS
MADE TO ORDER
FOR FARMING.
YES, I SUPPOSE IT IS
JUST GRASS TO MOST.
BUT NOT TO YOU, JIM?
TO ME, IT'S LAND THE WAY GOD
MADE IT
AND WANTS IT TO STAY.
AND I MAY BE WRONG
BUT I'VE GOT A HUNCH
THAT HE WANTS ME TO HELP
HIM KEEP IT THAT WAY.
I KNOW IT'S TOO SOON TO EXPECT
YOU TO SEE IT THAT WAY, LUTIE
BUT YOU WILL
SEE IT SOME DAY.
YOU'VE GOT TO SEE IT.
I WANT TO, JIM.
WELL, THERE SHE IS.
THE RANCH.
AND A HOUSE.
HURRY, JIM.
IT'S BETTER INSIDE.
YOU BRING MY SHORTENING?
I BROUGHT YOU SOMETHING
BETTER THAN SHORTENING.
HERE IT IS.
JEFF, OUR COOK.
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING OF
RIGHT NOW, JEFF?
I'M THINKING OF
MY SHORTENING.
BANTY, COME HERE.
THIS IS BANTY OUR HORSE WRANGLER.
HOW ARE YOU, BANTY?
I'M FINE, MA'AM.
YOU'RE WELCOME, MA'AM.
THANK YOU. THAT'S A WONDERFUL
WORD, "WELCOME."
GET THOSE BAGS
WILL YOU, JEFF?
COME ON, I'LL SHOW YOU
THE LAYOUT.
FINE. CAN'T WAIT
TO SEE THE KITCHEN.
SHE'S SURE NICE
TO LOOK AT.
SHE BETTER KEEP OUT
OF MY KITCHEN.
AND YOU CAN TAKE THEM BAGS IN.
MY...
THIS WILL FIX UP NICELY.
THE STOREROOM?
NO, NO, THIS IS THE PARLOR.
THE LIVING ROOM.
WHO LIVES IN IT,
DEAR?
WELL, NOBODY, REALLY,
VERY MUCH.
YOU SEE, WE'RE NOT
HERE VERY MUCH.
I, UH... I SUPPOSE IF THIS STUFF
WAS MOVED OUT OF HERE,
IT EVENTUALLY WOULD GET
TO LOOK
LIKE A LIVING ROOM,
WOULDN'T IT?
YES, I SUPPOSE IT WOULD.
I WONDER WHY I DIDN'T
HAVE THIS STUFF
MOVED OUT BEFORE YOU CAME?
DO YOU KNOW?
NO, I REALLY DON'T.
WELL, I'LL BE DOGGONE,
NEITHER DO I.
I WANT TO SEE
THE KITCHEN.
IT'S AT THE END
OF THE HALL.
UH, TAKE IT EASY
WITH JEFF.
JUDAS.
MAY I COME IN?
JUST LOOKING AROUND,
I'LL GET RIGHT OUT.
I'D BE MUCH OBLIGED.
LORENZO, I'M WAITING ON THAT CABBAGE.
OH, BISCUITS!
WHAT DO THEY LOOK LIKE?
LOOK LIKE BISCUITS,
GOOD BISCUITS.
TASTE LIKE THAT, TOO.
NOTHING LIKE SOUR MILK AND A BIG OVEN,
IS THERE, JEFF?
BAKING SODA WENT IN FIRST-
YOU CAN TELL THAT.
SHORTENING IN JUST RIGHT TOO...
AND DOUGH ROLLED
JUST ENOUGH.
JEFF, HOW WOULD
YOU LIKE TO HAVE A DOLLAR
FOR EVERY BISCUIT
YOU'VE MADE?
I'D TAKE A NICKELOF GRASS
AND I'D OWN THE PLACE.
NOT THAT I'D WANT TO.
NOT ANYMORE. NOT NOW.
IT'S TOO CROWDED.
A MAN NEEDS ELBOW ROOM.
I WON'T EVEN COME INSIDE YOUR
KITCHEN UNTIL YOU ASK ME TO,
HONESTLY, I WON'T.
SHE ATE ONE. SHE KNEW
WHAT SHE WAS EATING.
TOUGHER THAN WHANG LEATHER.
SHE CAN LIE FASTER
THAN A DOG CAN TROT.
WAIT! WAS YOU
BRUNG UP IN A BARN?
NOW, LISTEN, I DON'T WANT
NO REACHING,
NOR EATING WITH KNIFES
NOR DRINKING OUT OF SAUCERS.
THIS HERE WOMAN'S
A LADY.
I'M SCARED.
YOU'RE SCARED?
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THE BOYS ARE? COME ON.
UP!
LUTIE, THESE ARE THE BOYS.
BOYS, THIS IS
MRS. BREWTON.
HOWDY, MA'AM.
I'M VERY GLAD TO MEET YOU.
THERE.
SIT!
THAT'S YOUR PIECE
RIGHT THERE.
MA'AM...
YES, BANTY?
MRS. BREWTON,
THE BOYS...
WE'VE BEEN
THINKING,
AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING YOU WANT
THAT WE CAN DO,
WELL, WE'D ALL-FIRED GLAD TO.
WELL, UM.. THANK YOU, BANTY.
THAT'S NICE.
ANYTHING, MA'AM.
WELL, I, UH... LET'S SEE...
OH. YOU KNOW THOSE TREES
DOWN BY THE BROOK?
BROOK?
CREEK.
- CREEK? CREEK.
I WONDER IF YOU COULD
PULL THEM OUT FOR ME.
WHY, SURE, MA'AM,
IF THEY'RE
BOTHERING YOU ANY
WE CAN THROW A ROPE
AROUND 'EM
AND YANK 'EM OUT
BY THE ROOTS.
OH, NO. NO, I MEANT
COULD YOU DIG THEM UP
AND PLANT THEM AROUND THE HOUSE
SO THAT WE COULD
HAVE SOME SHADE?
IT WOULD BE LOVELY TO FENCE IN
THE WHOLE YARD.
FENCE?
WE'LL DO IT,
MRS. BREWTON-
ALL THE ORNERY
TREES YOU WANT.
WE'LL DO IT.
WON'T WE, BOYS?
UH, SURE WILL.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
GOOD NIGHT, MRS. BREWTON.
GOOD NIGHT.
DID I DO SOMETHING WRONG?
NO, NO, NO.
YOU SAID "FENCE. THAT'S A CUSSWORD
ON THE OPEN RANGE.
OH, MY!
COLONEL, I JUST BEEN DOWN
AT THE BARN.
PETE SAYS THAT NEW BULL'S BEEN
FIGHTING AGAIN.
- OH?
CUT UP PRETTY BAD.
OH, I'LL GO
RIGHT DOWN.
YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT,
WON'T YOU?
I CAN'T TAKE A CHANCE ON
THAT NEW BULL.
JEFF, JUST HOW
IMPORTANT IS A BULL?
WELL, THIS ONE
IS SURE A BEAUTY.
THERE'S A NEIGHBOR.
HUH? WHERE?
THERE.
OH, THAT'S JUST
HEADQUARTERS CAMP.
OH.
WE GOT A NEIGHBOR,
THOUGH.
MCGEE RANCH, LAYS RIGHT OVER
ABOUT 15 MILES.
15 MILES?
IS THERE A MRS. MCGEE?
NO. MCGEE'S
AN OLD BACH.
OH.
WELL...
GOOD NIGHT, JEFF.
LUTIE.
YES, JIM?
HAVE YOU BEEN CRYING?
NO.
HAVE YOU BEEN FEELING LIKE CRYING?
NO, JIM.
WHAT HAVE YOU
BEEN FEELING?
OH, I'VE BEEN...
JUST THINKING.
WHAT ABOUT?
OH, ABOUT... ABOUT ALL THE THINGS
I'M GOING TO DO
HOW I'M GOING TO
FIX UP THE HOUSE.
I'LL GET YOU EVERYTHING
YOU NEED, LUTIE.
YOU'RE SURE
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT?
VERY SURE.
LUTIE...
ONLY...
- ONLY WHAT?
ONE THING:
I WISH YOU LOOKED AT ME
THE WAY YOU LOOK AT THAT OUT THERE.
CUT ALL THEM COPPERWOODS
OUT OF THE HERD FIRST
MRS. BREWTON DON'T WANT NO
MIXED BREEDS AT THIS END OF THE RANGE.
JUST YEW AND TAMARIND.
HEY, THIS HERE'S A MAVERICK,
AIN'T IT?
SURE 'TIS. BRAND HER
AND LET HER GO.
COMMENCE PLANTING THEM NOW,
CLEAR AROUND THE HOUSE.
YEAH, LIKE A FENCE!
PAT THE DIRT UP NICE
AROUND THEM ROOTS.
THEY'RE KIND OF SPINDLY.
I'M AFRAID THE FIRST
GOOD WIND
WILL KNOCK 'EM FLATTER
THAN A FLITTER.
DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT
THEM LITTLE TREES.
THEY'RE SKINNY,
BUT THEY'RE AWFUL STUBBORN.
THANK YOU, BANTY.
I SAW SELINA HALL
IN TOWN YESTERDAY.
SHE'S STILL LIVING IN THAT LEAN-TO
BEHIND THE SALOON.
SHOULD'VE LEFT WHEN
THE OTHER SQUATTERS DID.
SHE'S TAKING IN WASHING NOW.
THE WATER'S LIKE LYE
HER HANDS WERE BLEEDING.
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH HER MAN?
THERE ARE PLENTY OF JOBS IN SALT FORK
IF A MAN WANTS TO WORK.
OH, HE'S WORKING
IN THE SALOON.
HE SMELLS EXACTLY
LIKE BEER.
JIM, SAM HALL'S A FARMER.
HE'S NOT A MAN TO BE
SMELLING OF BEER.
AND SELINA HAS TO CARRY ALL
THE WATER SHE USES FOR BLOCKS.
WELL, YOU CAN'T EXPECT TO FIND
MUCH WATER AROUND A SALOON.
OH, JIM.
SHE'S HAVING ANOTHER ONE,
YOU KNOW.
HUSBAND?
BABY.
OH.
SHE CAN'T HAVE IT IN THAT LEAN-TO
BEHIND THE SALOON.
SELINA SAYS THEY'VE BEEN TALKING
ABOUT FILING
ON A SPOT NEAR
MULE CREEK FLAT.
RIGHT SMACK IN THE MIDDLE
OF MY HEADQUARTERS RANGE.
YES. NICE AND CLOSE
TO US, ISN'T?
WHAT IS NICE ABOUT
BEING CLOSE?
JIM, SELINA'S MY FRIEND.
SHE'S THE ONLY ONE
I'VE GOT OUT HERE.
SHE'D BE A NEIGHBOR.
YOUR WORK TAKES YOU AWAY
SO MUCH.
I'M NOT COMPLAINING, DARLING.
BUT SHE'D BE SOMEONE
TO TALK TO.
WOMEN LIKE
TO TALK A LOT.
YES, I KNOW.
NO, THANKS.
THEY COULD BE SETTLED
BEFORE THE BABY COMES.
THAT'LL BE IN APRIL.
I'LL HAVE MINE IN MAY.
YOU'LL WHAT?
HAVE YOU SEEN DOC REID?
MM-HMM.
LUTIE!
GOOD GIRL, LUTIE
GOOD BOY, JIM.
SELINA SAYS SHE WANTS A BOY.
I'LL BUY YOU A WHOLE FLOOR OF THE BEST
HOSPITAL IN DENVER.
WHAT FOR? HOME'S THE PLACE
TO HAVE A BABY.
WONDER WHERE SELINA
WILL HAVE HERS.
OUT UNDER A BUSH SOMEWHERE,
I SUPPOSE.
I HAVE A HUNCH IT'S GOING
TO BE SOMEWHERE ON MULE CREEK FLAT.
OH, JIM! YOU'LL LIKE THE HALLS
WHEN YOU GET TO KNOW THEM.
I DON'T EXPECT TO GET TO
KNOW THEM.
WHY?
I DON'T THINK THEY'LL
BE HERE LONG ENOUGH.
DON'T BE CRUEL, JIM.
I WON'T HAVE TO. THE COUNTRY HERE
TAKES CARE OF ITSELF, LUTIE.
I DON'T KNOW JUST HOW
IT WILL HAPPEN,
BUT I'LL GIVE THEM
ABOUT 6 MONTHS.
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
FIND OUT ALL THAT
FOR YOURSELF,
AREN'T YOU?
ALL RIGHT, GO AHEAD.
TELL THEM TO FILE,
AND AS LONG AS THEY'RE HERE,
I'LL BE NICE TO THEM.
I LOVE YOU VERY MUCH,
COLONEL BREWTON.
KIND OF TOOK ADVANTAGE
OF ME
YOU KNOW THAT, DON'T YOU,
MRS. BREWTON?
THAT'S WHAT AN ADVANTAGE IS FOR.
THIS KiD BETTER LOOK LIKE YOU,
OR I'LL DROWN IT.
HI!
HELLO, SELINA! WHOA.
WE'RE GETTING A SOD HOUSE UP.
WHAT A COUNTRY-
MAN NEEDS A HOUSE,
HE JUST DIGS IT
OUT OF THE GROUND.
YES, QUITE A COUNTRY
AND GETTING BETTER.
WHY, MR. CHAMBERLAIN.
MRS. BREWTON.
SAY, I DIDN'T KNOW YOU FOLKS
WAS ACQUAINTED.
OH, YES. MR. CHAMBERLAIN
IS AN OLD, OLD FRIEND AND ADVISOR.
DID HE ADVISE YOU TOO, SELINA?
SHOWED US HOW TO
FILE ON THIS LAND,
IF YOU CALL THAT ADVISING.
I BROUGHT A PRESENT FOR LITTLE MOLLY.
HIS NAME IS
REDEYE SON-OF-A-GUN.
HERE, MOLLY. HERE'S
A PRESENT FOR YOU.
I HOPE YOU CAN USE ALL THAT
STUFF, SELINA.
WHY, HONEY, I CAN USE ANYTHING
FROM A BUTTONHOOK TO
A KITCHEN RANGE.
COLONEL BREWTON SENT US OVER
A SIDE OF BEEF.
THIS BUFFALO GRASS SURE
GOES DOWN DEEP.
HELLO, SAM!s
I'D FEEL A LOT EASIER IF YOU'D TAKE
THAT BEEF BACK, MRS. BREWTON.
WE DON'T NEED IT.
SHUT UP SAM,
SURE WE NEED IT.
WELL, MAYBE WE DO-
FOR EATING PURPOSES.
BUT I'D SURE CHOKE ON IT
IF I FIGURED TAKING IT
GAVE ANYBODY
ANY WRONG IDEAS.
WE'RE HERE BECAUSE WE
GOT A RIGHT TO BE HERE.
NOBODY'S LETTING US
DO ANYTHING.
WE'RE JUST DOING IT AND
WE CAN TAKE CARE OF OURSELVES.
I KNOW THAT, SAM.
YOU WANT LUTIE TO FEEL
SHE AIN'T WELCOME?
THAT AIN'T WHAT I MEAN,
AND YOU KNOW IT.
YOU WANT TO COME TO SEE MY WIFE
HERE ON OUR PLACE,
YOU COME, AND MOST WELCOME,
MRS. BREWTON.
THANK YOU, SAM.
DON'T TAKE SAM
SERIOUS.
HE'S JUST BEING A MAN.
I KNOW. THEY'RE RATHER PECULIAR PEOPLE
SOMETIMES, AREN'T THEY?
SOMETIMES?!
YOU KNOW, I OWE YOU
AN APOLOGY.
WHEN YOU FIRST DROVE UP TODAY,
I THOUGHT
"HERE COMES
LADY BOUNTIFUL."
I TAKE IT BACK. YOU'RE REALLY
FOND OF SAM AND SELINA HALL.
SELINA WAS MY FIRST FRIEND OUT HERE.
I'M AWFULLY GLAD SHE DOESN'T
SEEM LONELY.
DID YOU EXPECT HER TO BE?
WELL, THIS IS THE PLACE FOR IT.
HARDLY A WOMAN'COUNTRY.
IT COULD BE.
IT SHOULD BE,
AND SOMEDAY IT WILL.
WHEN? HOW?
WHY NOT? IT'S HAPPENED
IN OTHER PLACES.
FIRST THE COVERED WAGONS,
THEN THE HOUSES,
THEN THE FARMS-FAMILIES,
CHILDREN GROWING UP.
SURE, IT WILL BE A WOMAN'S COUNTRY THEN.
WOMEN WILL HELP
MAKE IT THEIRS.
DO YOU HEAR THAT,
MR. CHAMBERLAIN?
THE HEAR IT?
THE PEOPLE, I MEAN,
OUT THERE.
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF
SELINAS AND SAMS
REALLY, ISN'T IT?
COLONEL BREWTON HEARS SOMETHING
SO DIFFERENT.
I'M AFRAID YOU'VE GOT ME WRONG.
I DON'T HEAR ANY VOICES.
I ONLY KNOW THIS IS GOOD LAND
THAT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING
UNLESS PEOPLE GET
THEIR LIVING OUT IT.
USE IT, LIVE ON IT.
THAT'S WHERE I COME IN.
I'M GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS.
ANYWAY, I'LL MAKE
A STAB AT IT.
I TURN BACK HERE.
MAYBE THEN, THIS WOULD BE
MY COUNTRY TOO.
AND YOU-
WHAT DO YOU HEAR?
I'VE BEEN TOLD
THAT A GOOD WIFE
HEARS ONLY WHAT HER HUSBAND
WANTS HER TO HEAR.
WELL, WHAT AN OLD-FASHIONED IDEA.
DON'T BE UNFAIR,
MR. CHAMBERLAIN.
YOU MUST ADMIT THAT
COLONEL BREWTON'S
MADE IT EASY
FOR SELINA AND SAM.
ONE SIDE OF BEEF?
CONSCIENCE MONEY.
YOU ARE UNFAIR.
I'M REALISTIC. DON'T FORGET
IT'S ONLY ONE SAM, ONE SELINA
AND ONE SIDE OF BEEF.
YOU SPEAK OF THOUSANDS.
I'M WONDERING WHY
BREWTON EVEN HELPED ONE.
HE'S A PIRATE, YOU KNOW.
YOU DON'T KNOW HIM,
THAT'S ALL. I DO.
WHY DO WOMEN INSIST ON LOVING MEN
FOR WHAT THEY WANT THEM TO BE
INSTEAD OF WHAT THEY ARE?
GOOD DAY, MR. CHAMBERLAIN.
YOU KNOW, I ENVY BREWTON
VERY MUCH.
YOU MEAN, YOU ENVY
THE PIRATE HIS LOOT?
NOT ALL OF IT.
JUST ONE THING.
I'LL GET AROUND TO TELLING YOU
WHAT IT IS SOME DAY.
COME NOW, MR. CHAMBERLAIN,
I'M NOT A CHILD.
I DISLIKE THIS
SCURRYING ABOUT.
IF YOU THINK I'M ATTRACTIVE, WHY DON'T
YOU SAY SO AND GET IT OVER WITH.
THAT ISN'T WHAT I MEANT,
BUT NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT
YOU ARE ATTRACTIVE.
YOU'RE VERYATTRACTIVE.
I KNOW IT, AND YOU KNOW
I KNOW IT.
YOU'VE KNOWN IT
SINCE THE FIRST TIME I LOOKED AT YOU.
YES, I-I HAVE MR. CHAMBERLAIN.
AND NOW YOU'VE SAID IT
AND WE'RE DONE WITH IT.
ARE WE?
I DON'T THINK SO.
THE COMPANY'S ALL HERE.
AIN'T THAT BABY ASLEEP YET?
NOW, YOU GO ON AND GET OUT OF HERE
YOU'RE KEEPING HER ALL RILED UP.
AND KEEP HER
OUT OF MY WAY TOO
IF YOU WANT ME TO GET
THIS CHILD TO SLEEP.
EVERYTHING READY
DOWNSTAIRS, JEFF?
WELL, OF COURSE IT IS,
ELSE WHY I'VE BEEN OVER THAT STOVE
SINCE DAYLIGHT?
NOW, GO ON, GIT!
GOOD NIGHT, SARAH BETH.
YOU TOO. NOW GO ON.
GET OUT OF HERE. VAMOOSE!
SURE IS LIGHT-FOOTED, AIN'T HE?
LIGHT-FINGERED, TOO,
IT BEGINS TO LOOK LIKE.
GENTLEMEN, I GIVE YOU
THE LADY FROM ST. LOUIS.
A GOOD TOAST TO REMEMBER
IN THIS HOUSE.
DRINK HEARTY, GENTLEMEN.
I KNOW YOU OF OLD
YOU ROBBED MY POOR FATHER
OF SILVER AND GOLD.
OH, WHISKEY, RYE WHISKEY...
WHAT ARE YOU SINGING?
IT'S A LULLABY, AND IT WON'T DO
MUCH LULLING
IF YOU PEOPLE KEEP COMING IN HERE
AND STOMPING AROUND.
HOW DO I LOOK, JEFF?
REAL PRETTY.
GO TO SLEEP, BABY...
JEFF, DO YOU EVER GET TIRED
OF COOKING FOR ALL
THESE PARTIES?
I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT THAT IF
I WAS YOU, COLONEL.
WOMEN GOT A CERTAIN NUMBER OF
PARTIES IN THEIR SYSTEM,
AND THEY JUST GOT
TO GET 'EM OUT.
GO TO SLEEP BABY...
GO TO SLEEP NOW.
JEFF, YOU'RE A WONDERFUL MOTHER.
YOU KNOW, BEING STIRRED UP
MUST BE GOOD FOR YOU, LUTIE.
BEEN MARRIED A WHOLE YEAR
AND STILL DON'T LOOK LIKE A WIFE.
STOP IT, BRICE.
WHAT KEEPS YOU
SO STIRRED UP, LUTIE?
YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING
YOU WANT, HAVEN'T YOU?
STOP IT.
STOP IT, BRICE.
YOU CAN STOP ME EASY.
JUST TELL ME YOU'VE GOT
EVERYTHING YOU WANT.
TELL ME YOU'VE GOT EVEN PART
OF WHAT YOU WANT.
OH, COME ON, LUTIE,
WHY DON'T YOU ANSWER ME?
I'LL TELL YOU WHY- BECAUSE YOU
DON'T LIE VERY WELL.
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN SAY
THAT YOU'RE NOT AFRAID TO SAY.
JUST WHITE SAND,
JUST AS SOFT AS-
HELLO, NICK.
DANCE WITH ME, JIM.
WHAT'S THE MATTER, LUTIE?
NOTHING. THIS IS YOUR DANCE,
THAT'S ALL.
PLEASE.
MADE YOU SOME TEA.
THANK YOU, JEFF.
MAYBE IT WILL WARM ME
UP A LITTLE.
A REAL HEAVY SNOWFALL.
SNOWFALL? IT'S A BLIZZARD.
I'M WORRIED ABOUT
THE COLONEL, JEFF.
HE HASN'T BEEN HOME FOR 48 HOURS.
OH, I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT HIM.
HE'S ALL RIGHT.
HE'S ALWAYS ALL RIGHT.
I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE CATTLE.
HEY, KEEP THEM AWAY FROM
THAT BARBED WIRE!
HEAD 'EM OFF!
FENCE! KEEP 'EM OUT
OF THE HALLS'
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO, SAM?
I TOLD BREWTON'S MEN THE NEXT STEER
THAT BUSTED DOWN MY FENCE
WAS GONNA GET BLOWN
TO PIECES.
BUT, SAM, THEM CATTLE
DON'T KNOW WHERE
THEY'RE DRIFTING IN THIS STORM.
MAYBE THEY'LL HEAD
THE OTHER WAY.
DON'T GO OUT THERE, SAM.
IT'S ONLY LOOKING FOR TROUBLE.
TROUBLE? IT WAS
TROUBLE LAST SUMMER
WHEN THEM CATTLE
TROMPLED OUR RYE CROP
BEFORE WE COULD HARVEST IT,
WASN'T IT?
I GOT FALL WHEAT PLANTED
OUT THERE
AND I AIN'T GONNA STAND BY
AND SEE IT GET RUINED!
SELINA, WITH THE NEW BABY COMING
IF WE DON'T MAKE THIS CROP
WE GOT TO GIVE UP.
NO, SAM! DON'T!
SAM, STAY HERE!
SAM! COME BACK! SAM!
KEEP THEM CATTLE
OUT OF MY WHEAT!
GET 'EM OUT OF THERE!
SAM, LOOK OUT!
COME ON, LET'S GET HIM!
KILL THAT YELLOWBELLY!
SAM!
SAM. SAM...
SAM.
SAM. SAM!
I'LL BE ALL RIGHT,
SELINA.
JEFF, JEFF!
IS JIM BACK?
NO, MRS. BREWTON,
THE COLONEL AIN'T HOME YET.
WELL, THEN WHAT'S HAPPENED, JEFF?
SOME OF THE BOYS
JUST GOT IN.
I HEATED UP SOME COFFEE.
NOW, YOU GET BACK TO BED. IT'S COLD.
NO, I'M NOT GOING BACK TO BED
UNTIL YOU TELL ME WHAT'S HAPPENED.
IT WAS NOTHING MUCH.
A LITTLE BLOWUP OVER AT HALLS.
HALL SHOT ONE OF OUR STEERS,
AND THE BOYS KIND OF WORKED HIM
OVER. NOW GIT.
WORKED HIM OVER BAD?
WELL, THE BOYS SAID "GOOD."
I'M GOING OVER TO THE HALLS.
YOU AIN'T GOING NOWHERE.
THERE'S DRIFTS.
YOU GET ME A HORSE.
SELINA'S EXPECTING ANOTHER BABY
I'M GOING TO SEE
IF SHE'S ALL RIGHT.
WELL, WRAP UP WARM.
SAM! I'VE COME
TO SEE SELINA.
IS SHE ALL RIGHT?
LET ME IN, SAM.
NO.
WHAT'S HAPPENED?
SHE TRIED TO HELP ME.
THE BABY'S DEAD.
NO, SAM...
MAKE HER GO AWAY, SAM.
I DON'T EVER WANT TO SEE HER AGAIN.
SEND HER AWAY!
SELINA-
YOU HEARD WHAT SHE SAID.
NOW, GO ON BACK TO BREWTON.
TELL HIM HE'S WON.
TELL HIM HES WON A BIG VICTORY.
WE LEAVE NOW.
NOW GO ON. GET OUT.
WHOA.
GOOD. LOOK AFTER HIM
SURE, COLONEL.
LUTIE, I HEARD
ABOUT THE HALLS.
YES.
IT WAS A BAD NIGHT
ALL AROUND.
I LOST A COUPLE
OF HUNDRED HEAD.
SORRY, JIM.
WELL, IT'S NICE TO HOME
AGAIN WITH YOU.
JIM, SELINA'S BABY
IS DEAD.
I KNOW. TOO BAD.
JIM...
JIM, SHE'S SO BITTER
AND SO LOST.
WE'VE GOT TO LET HER
KNOW HOW SORRY WE ARE.
WE'VE GOT TO HELP THEM.
THE BEST WAY TO HELP THEM
IS TO STAY AWAY FROM THEM.
JIM, THEY SAY THEY'RE LEAVING.
LET THEM GO.
I MADE A MISTAKE BEFORE, LUTIE.
I SHOULDN'T HAVE GIVEN IN TO YOU.
I WON'T AGAIN.
THE TIME I DID THOSE PEOPLE HARM
WAS WHEN LET THEM FILE.
MY FAULT, LUTIE
NOT YOURS.
JIM, IF YOU WON'T
HELP THE HALLS
FOR THEMSELVES,
THEN DO IT FOR ME.
I LOVE SELINA, AND RIGHT
NOW, SHE HATES ME.
THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO, LUTIE.
THIS WOULD ONLY HAPPEN AGAIN,
OR SOMETHING SIMILAR.
IT FIGURED TO HAPPEN.
THIS TOUGH COUNTRY, LUTIE.
THIS COUNTRY, I'M SICK TO DEATH
OF TALKING ABOUT THIS COUNTRY.
YOU REALLY
THINK IT'S MORE IMPORTANT
THAN THE PEOPLE IN IT.
WELL, THAT DEPENDS,
IT DEPENDS ON
WHO THE PEOPLE ARE
AND WHAT THEY'RE UP TO.
YOU LET SELINA AND SAM HALL STAY HERE
BECAUSE YOU WANTED SOMETHING
LIKE THIS TO HAPPEN-
TO SHOW ME,
TO SHOW EVERYONE
YOU DON'T CARE
HOW MANY PEOPLE DIE.
JUST SO LONG AS YOU KEEP THE GRASS
FOR YOURSELF.
LUTIE...
LUTIE... I'LL TRY TO TELL YOU, LUTIE.
IT'S HARD TO SAY
BUT...
THE HALLS DON'T COUNT
FOR MUCH, LUTIE.
NEITHER DO WE.
BUT THAT OUT THERE
DOES...
AND MEN LIKE CHAMBERLAIN,
THEY WANT TO FARM IT.
THEY WANT TO DIG IT UP
AND DRAW THE WATER OUT OF ITS VEINS,
LET THE SUN GET AT IT,
WAY DOWN DEEP.
IT WOULD CURL UP
AND DIE THEN, LUTIE,
IT WOULD BE DEAD,
AND SO WOULD THE WHOLE COUNTRY,
IT WOULD NEVER LIVE AGAIN.
I TRIED TO TELL YOU, LUTIE,
BUT YOU DIDN'T HEAR IT, DID YOU?
WE WON'T ABOUT IT ANYMORE.
THAT'S RIGHT NO TALK, JUST YOU
AND THE GRASS THE OUT THERE.
THAT'S REALLY THE WAY
YOU WANT IT, ISN'T IT?
NO, LUTIE. I WANT
YOU WITH IT, TOO.
YOU DON'T NEED ME,
YOU NEVER DID.
LUTIE...
YOU'VE NEVER LIVED WITH ME.
I'VE BEEN HERE.
YOU'VE BEEN OUT THERE.
JIM, I'D LIKE TO GO AWAY.
I'VE GOT TO.
IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA.
YOU COULD DO A LITTLE
SHOPPING IN DENVER.
SOME THINKING TOO.
DENVER PAPER!
ROCKY MOUNTAIN NEWS!
NEWS?
DENVER PAPER?
CALL FOR MR. O'CONNOR!
CALL FOR
MR. O'CONNOR!
WELL, SIR, I FIGURE IF WE'RE EVER GOING
TO BREAK THE HOLD
OF THE CATTLEMEN,
WE'LL HAVE TO MAKE SALT FORK
A FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT.
AND SEE TO IT THAT AN IMPARTIAL JUDGE
IS APPOINTED. - RIGHT.
HOPE YOU ENJOY YOUR STAY
AT THE BROWN PALACE, MRS. BREWTON.
THE MARSHALL ALWAYS WINDS UP
ON THE RIGHT SIDE.
EXCUSE ME, GENTLEMEN, ONE MOMENT.
LUTIE! IN DENVEROF ALL PLACES!
BUT NOT FOR LONG.
LONG ENOUGH TO TAKE
PITY ON ME AT DINNER TONIGHT.
I'M AFRAID NOT BRICE,
MY TRAIN GOES IN THE MORNING, VERY EARLY.
THERE'S NO TRAIN LEAVING
FOR SALT FORK IN THE MORNING.
THIS TRAIN GOES TO ST. LOUIS.
OH, I'M SORRY, LUTIE.
I UNDERSTAND, OF COURSE
YOU DON'T WANT TO
SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE.
LUTIE...
I HAVE A SLEIGH
WITH A DRIVER.
CONSIDER IT YOURS
IF YOU'D LIKE SOME AIR.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, BRICE.
THAT'S VERY SWEET OF YOU.
WITHOUT ME, OF COURSE.
CALL FOR ME AT 8:00.
BREWTON'S A BIG MAN,
I'VE NEVER DENIED IT.
BUT, WELL, IT JUST DOESN'T LEAVE
ROOM FOR ANYONE ELSE-
FOR YOU, IN THIS CASE.
I USED TO WONDER HOW LONG
IT WOULD TAKE YOU TO
ADMIT THAT TO YOURSELF.
YOU NEVER REALLY EXPECTED
HIM TO CHANGE, DID YOU?
WHAT I'M SAYING IS,
IT WAS REALLY YOUR FAULT.
YOU KNEW IT WAS HOPELESS.
YOU KNEW IT THE FIRST
TIME I SAW YOU.
YOU KNEW IT
IN THE COURTROOM.
IT'S BEEN WRITTEN ALL OVER YOUR FACE
EVERY TIME SINCE THEN.
THE HALLS WERE YOUR FAULT, TOO.
YOU INSISTED ON PLUNKING THEM DOWN
RIGHT IN THE LION'S DEN.
AND SAT AROUND HOPING
NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN.
WELL, IT HAPPENED.
IT WAS BOUND TO HAPPEN
BREWTON BEING BREWTON.
OH, LUTIE, I'M SORRY,
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY.
I JUST WANT TO CRY,
THAT'S ALL.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT YOU.
IT'S ALL RIGHT. IT'S FINE,
ONLY, ONLY...
I FEEL THAT IT'S THE FIRST TIME
THAT ANYONE
HAS SPOKEN TO ME
IN MONTHS IN MONTHS
IN MONTHS
I MEAN, ABOUT ME.
ANYWAY, WHAT YOU SAY
IS TRUE.
AND I DON'T MIND
LOOKING AT IT AT LAST.
IT DOESN'T LEAVE ME MUCH,
BUT I DON'T MIND
LOOKING AT IT.
IT LEAVES YOU ME,
LUTIE.
COME IN.
COME IN, BRICE.
THE ST. LOUIS TRAIN
LEAVES IN HALF AN HOUR.
I KNOW.
I HAVE A LITTLE MORE
PACKING TO DO.
WHEN PEOPLE PACK,
THEY'RE GOING SOMEWHERE.
WHEN THEY'RE GOING SOMEWHERE,
IT'S BETTER TO KNOW WHERE.
WELL, WHAT DO YOU MEAN, BRICE?
I MEAN, WHAT'S IT
GOING TO BE, LUTIE?
I'LL GIVE YOU TIME.
I'LL WAIT FOR YOU.
I'LL STAND BACK UNTIL YOU SEND
FOR ME
OR I'LL TAKE THAT TRAIN
TO ST. LOUIS WITH YOU.
IT WILL BE WHAT YOU WANT,
LUTIE, WHATEVER IT IS.
IT WILL BE YOUR WAY,
ALL THE WAY.
BRICE...
I'M SO ASHAMED...
AND SO SORRY.
ASHAMED FOR ME,
SORRY FOR YOU.
AND JIM.
BREWTON'S ALL RIGHT.
HE'S GOT YOU NOW
AS HE NEVER HAD YOU BEFORE.
NO, BRICE.
YOU'RE HANGING ON TO YOURSELF
RIGHT NOW
TO KEEP FROM RUNNING BACK TO HIM.
NO, BRICE.
AND YOU'RE GOING.
- NO.
YES, YOU ARE. NOTHING ON EARTH
CAN STOP YOU.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.
I KNOW HE WON'T CHANGE.
I KNOW I'LL GO HATING
WHAT HE DOES.
AND IT WILL
ALWAYS HURT ME.
BUT NO MATTER WHAT HE DOES
OR WHAT I THINK...
NO MATTER WHERE I GO...
I'LL KEEP FEELING THAT MOST OF ME
IS THERE WITH HIM.
IT MEANS THAT YOU LOVE HIM.
YES.
AND IF I DO,
THEN I'VE GOT
TO BELIEVE IN HIM...
AND GO ALONG WITH HIM.
I'LL GO BACK. TELL HIM
WHAT I'VE DONE...
IF I HAVE THE COURAGE.
I'M SORRY FOR YOU, LUTIE.
I GOT A BIG FIRE IN THE LIVING ROOM,
MRS. BREWTON.
THANK YOU, JEFF.
HAS SARAH BETH BEEN ALL RIGHT?
SHE'S FINER THAN THAN FUZZ.
I GOT A REAL NICE FIRE
DOWNSTAIRS.
ALL RIGHT, JEFF.
COLONEL TRADED JOE NETHERWOOD
OUT OF IT.
IT'S THE ONLY PIANO IN
THE TERRITORY.
GAVE HIM HIS BEST WHITEFACE BULL.
GOOD FIRE, AIN'T IT?
YES, JEFF.
THANK YOU, JIM.
JUST A FOOL IDEA I HAD.
KIND OF LIKE
HAVING YOU AROUND.
PLAY ME A TUNE, LUTIE.
SAD MUSIC
OR HAPPY MUSIC?
UP TO YOU. YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF TUNE
YOU'VE GOT IN YOUR HEAD.
LIKE IT?
PRETTY. KIND OF
A SURPRISE, THOUGH.
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SAD.
IT WAS SAD WHEN
YOU WENT AWAY.
COME HERE, JIM.
STAND BEHIND ME.
JIM, WHEN I WENT AWAY,
I DIDN'T INTEND TO COME BACK
EXCEPT TO GET SARAH BETH.
I WAS GOING TO ST. LOUIS.
I FELT IT WAS STILL MY TOWN,
THAT I WOULD BE RIGHT THERE.
YEAH. TREES
IN ST. LOUIS.
YES, TREES YOU DON'T HAVE TO PLANT
AND CHERISH AND PROTECT.
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU EVER NOTICED.
WHY DID YOU PLANT
THEM, LUTIE?
WERE THEY TO SHUT SOMETHING OUT
OR TO SHUT YOURSELF IN?
JIM, I WAS JEALOUS-
PLAIN MEAN JEALOUS
OF THIS COUNTRY AND THE GRASS,
AND I TRIED TO FIGHT IT.
YES, WITH THE TREES AND
WITH SELINA AND SAM
AND WITH A LOT
THINGS.
I WON'T FIGHT IT
ANYMORE, JIM.
I'LL KNOW THAT IT'S THERE,
AND I WON'T CRY ABOUT IT.
AND I WON'T
SAY BITTER THINGS,
AND I WON'T RUN AWAY.
I... I'M BACK, JIM,
IF YOU'LL HAVE ME.
I'LL HAVE YOU, LUTIE.
JIM, DON'T YOU WANT TO ASK ME
HOW DENVER WAS?
AH. DENVER'S ALWAYS
DENVER.
BUT, JIM...
I'LL MAKE IT
UP TO YOU, JIM.
WHAT IS THERE TO MAKE UP?
YOU'RE HERE.
THERE'S REALLY NO REASON
TO WORRY, LUTIE.
JUST DO THE WAY YOU DID
WITH SARAH BETH.
I'LL GO TELL
JIM YOU'RE FINE.
YES, DOC, I'M FINE.
WHEN DO YOU KNOW
WHEN IT'S TUNED?
I JUST KNOW.
DOC, WHAT'S HOLDING UP
SCIENCE?
WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO BE
ABLE TO TELL A MAN
WHETHER IT'S A BOY OR A GIRL?
WHAT DO YOU WANT, JIM?
WELL, WE GOT A GIRL.
COME ON! CHEER UP, DOC.
JIM, YOU'VE GOT TO REALIZE
LUTIE'S OUT OF HER HEAD,
BOUND TO SAY THINGS
WE CAN'T UNDERSTAND.
JUST-JUST DON'T
THINK ABOUT IT.
GO ON DOWNSTAIRS AND LET
JEFF GET YOU A CUP OF COFFEE.
OH, JEFF POUR HIM A CUP
OF COFFEE.
I GOT A POT
ON THE STOVE.
AND ME, TOO.
YOU'D BETTER
COME IN, DOCTOR.
SHE'S QUIT THAT WILD
TALK AND
I THINK THE BABY
IS GETTING CLOSE.
I NEVER HEARD
SUCH CARRYINGS-ON.
DID YOU HEAR
WHAT SHE SAID-
MRS. RYAN, NONE OF US HEARD ANYTHING
IN THAT ROOM WORTH REPEATING.
OF COURSE NOT.
CERTAINLY NOT.
I HOPE YOU REMEMEBER
THAT, MRS. RYAN.
WELL, LUTIE,
WE'VE GOT A SON.
MACK, WANT TO HAVE A SMOKE?
THANKS, JIM. ONLY GET THESE
WHEN I COME HERE.
DOC?
NO THANKS, JIM.
MRS. McCURTIN WAS SAYING
ONLY YESTERDAY, LUTIE,
BEFORE BROCK WAS BORN
WE USED TO SEE A LOT OF YOU IN TOWN.
THE PAST YEAR OR SO,
YOU'VE BEEN HOLING UP ON US.
SHE SPENDS TOO MUCH TIME
WITH THEM CHILDREN,
SHE'S BOUND TO SPOIL THEM.
SURE BOTH BABIES GOT OVER
THE CROUP RIGHT?
THEY GOT OVER IT ALL RIGHT,
NOT ON ACCOUNT OF THAT
MEDICINE YOU GAVE THEM.
YOU GOING TO TAKE THIS OR
AREN'T YOU?
THAT SO, JEFF?
WHAT CURED THEM?
BAKING SODA,
AND LOTS OF IT.
CURE ANY KIND OF A COLD.
DOCTORS!
WE GAVE THEM YOUR MEDICINE
BEHIND JEFF'S BACK.
DON'T EVER LET HIM
KNOW ABOUT IT, THOUGH.
WELL, COME ON, MACK,
LET'S HAVE IT.
WHAT?
THE BAD NEWS.
HOW'D YOU KNOW?
ALL OVER YOU
EVER SINCE YOU GOT HERE.
I'VE GOT A HUNCH CHAMBERLAIN'S
UP TO SOMETHING.
HOW'D YOU KNOW THAT?
ALL OVER HIM THE LAST TIME
I SAW HIM.
AND YOU'RE RIGHT, JIM.
HE'S UP TO PLENTY.
I'LL LEAVE YOU TO YOUR BUSINESS
AND YOUR BRANDY.
NO, NO, SIT DOWN. MACK'S A LAWYER.
HE LIKES AN AUDIENCE.
CHAMBERLAIN'S GOT SALT FORK
MADE A FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT.
GOT HIMSELF ELECTED JUDGE.
WHAT ABOUT JUDGE WHITE?
ONLY LOCAL MATTERS NOW.
OH, IS THAT SO?
AND HERES CHAMBERLAIN'S
MESSAGE TO YOU, JIM.
TOMORROW HE'S SENDING NOTICE TO
EVERY SQUATTER IN TOWN
AND THERE'S A WHOLE
THE WAGON TRAIN OF 'EM-
THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S
REPRESENTED HERE NOW
AND WILL THEM
FULL PROTECTION.
YOU'LL HAVE A HUNDRED CLAIMS ON
YOUR RANGE BEFORE THE WEEK IS OUT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK
WE OUGHT TO DO, MACK?
I'VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR A CHANCE-
ANY CHANCE OF ANY
KIND- TO HEAD IT OFF
BUT THERE ISN'T ANY.
IT'S THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT NOW,
THE LAW OF THE LAND,
AND IT'S OBEYED.
IT'S GOT TO BE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK, LUTIE?
I? WELL, I THINK
MACK HAS SAID IT, JIM.
IT HAD TO HAPPEN, JIM.
EVERYONE KNEW IT.
I THINK YOU DID
IN YOUR HEART.
NO.
NO, I DIDN'T, LUTIE.
WELL!
GOOD.
GOOD NIGHT DEAR.
HOW IS YOUR FINGER
WHERE YOU CUT IT?
YOU TOLD ME
IT WOULDN'T HURT.
WELL, IT WON'T HURT, EITHER.
ANYTHING YOU SAY
GOES, HUH, JIM?
SURE. SHE'S JIM'S GIRL.
HER FIRST CRUSH.
COME, SARAH BETH.
GOOD NIGHT, DEAR.
GOOD NIGHT.
GOOD NIGHT, LUTIE.
VERY NICE DINNER.
THANK YOU.
GOOD NIGHT, LUTIE.
GOOD NIGHT, JIM.
GOOD NIGHT, DEAR.
DON'T GET LUTIE
WRONG, JIM.
SHE'S A WOMAN,
AND, WELL..
I DON'T GET HER
WRONG, DOC.
IT'S JUST THAT I KEEP
WISHING SHE WAS REALLY ON MY SIDE.
WELL, HELP YOURSELVES,
GENTLEMEN.
WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO, JIM?
RIGHT NOW? GOING FOR
A LITTLE WALK.
IS THAT COLD?
BANTY,
BRING JOE.
HOLD HER A MINUTE.
CAN I GO UNDER THERE?
ANDY, YOU TAKE THE DAVIS PLACE
AND MCGEE'S RANCH.
TELL THEM I WANTS TO SEE THEM.
TELL THEM IT WON'T HURT
TO BRING THEIR WINCHESTERS.
WAKE, YOU TAKE VALEZ'S RANCH AND
THE OUTFIT SOUTH.
YOU BET, COLONEL.
GET GOING.
YOU WERE GOING
TO PUT ME TO BED.
YES, DARLING. I'LL COME RIGHT
BACK AND PUT YOU TO BED.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
I COULD CRY FOR YOU, JIM
DON'T WASTE IT
ON ME, LUTIE.
WHY DON'T YOU GO UP AND TRY TO
GET SOME SLEEP?
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WHAT I NEED.
WHY DO YOU KEEP
LOOKING AT ME?
WHAT DO YOU KEEP
WANTING OF ME?
NOTHING, LUTIE. NOTHING ANYMORE.
I DON'T EXPECT IT.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO DO, JIM?
IF CHAMBERLAIN WANTS TO DECLARE WAR,
HE'S GOING TO GET IT.
YOU'RE REALLY GOING TO GO OUT
AND SHOOT
THE FIRST HOMESTEADERS THAT
COME OVER?
THAT'S RIGHT.
IN COLD BLOOD?
IF THAT'S WHAT
YOU WANT TO CALL IT.
DON'T DO IT, JIM.
GIVE UP ON IT.
WHO ARE YOU
PROTECTING?
YOU, JIM. YOU.
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT.
WHY DO YOU WANT ME TO LOSE?
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
BUT YOU DO, DON'T YOU?
WELL, I-I GUESS SO.
MAYBE I DO.
WHY? WHY?
I... I... MAYBE THEN
I'D HAVE A CHANCE.
MAYBE YOU'D TURN
TO ME-TO ME ALONE.
IS THAT THE ONLY REASON?
JIM, IT'S MURDER,
KILLING PEOPLE.
I DON'T KNOW
IF I COULD BEAR IT.
I... I'VE TRIED TO FIT IN, I'VE TRIED TO
BE WHAT YOU WANT, BUT...
YOU HAVE DONE THAT.
I'VE SEEN YOU TRYING.
BUT TO GO OUT
IN COLD BLOOD...
BUT I'VE SEEN OTHER THINGS I'VE SAID
NOTHING ABOUT.
THEY'RE INNOCENT PEOPLE, JIM.
I'M GOING TO DO
WHAT I HAVE TO DO.
ALL RIGHT, JIM.
ALL RIGHT, WHAT?
DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.
I'VE NOTHING MORE TO SAY.
AND WHAT WILL YOU DO?
NOTHING. I'LL WAIT.
NOTHING MORE TO SAY?
NO.
YOU'D GO ON LIVING WITH A MURDERER,
LUTIE? WHY?
WHY DO YOU OWE ME THAT?
THAT'S A LOT.
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT ONCE.
YOU'VE CHANGED/
WHAT CHANGED YOU?
WHY DO YOU OWE ME SO MUCH?
THE TRIP TO DENVER, MAYBE?
YOU NEVER REALLY TOLD ME
WHY YOU CAME BACK HERE.
DO YOU WANT TO TELL ME
NOW, LUTIE?
NOTHING MORE TO DAY.
WELL, I GUESS THAT
SAYS IT ALL.
IT TOOK A LONG TIME
BUT IT'S ALL SET NOW.
I TRIED, JIM. I TRIED.
MORE THAN ONCE.
BUT YOU JUST LOOKED AT ME.
YOU JUST LOOKED AT ME
AND STOPPED ME.
I COULDN'T. I COULDN'T.
BUT NOW I'M GLAD
IT'S OUT IN THE OPEN.
I DON'T CARE WHAT HAPPENS.
I'M GLAD IT'S OUT
AFTER 2 YEARS. I'M GLAD IT'S OUT.
WHEN DO YOU WANT TO LEAVE, LUTIE?
I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE.
THEN WHEN ARE YOU
GOINGTO LEAVE?
YOU CAN CATCH THE NEXT TRAIN.
YOU'D BETTER GO UP AND PACK.
WE'LL START IN THE MORNING.
I DON'T SEE HOW,
WITH ALL THE CHILDREN'S THINGS.
THE CHILDREN'S THINGS?
YOU WON'T HAVE TO PACK THOSE.
YOU THINK I'D LEAVE THEM HERE?
I'M SURE OF IT.
I COULDN'T LEAVE THEM.
YOU CAN TAKE
ONE OF THEM, LUTIE.
ONE?
YOU CAN TAKE BROCK.
BUT IF YOU TAKE HIM
YOU TAKE EVERYTHING THAT GOES WITH IT,
AND SO DOES HE.
IF YOU LEAVE HIM
I'LL BRING HIM UP, AND I'LL DO FOR HIM.
A MAN WANTS A SON.
ALL RIGHT, JIM.
I THOUGHT YOU'D
SEE IT MY WAY.
BUT I... I WON'T LET YOU KEEP
THEM FOREVER. I'LL FIGHT.
THAT'S ONE FIGHT
I WOULDN'T LOSE, LUTIE.
YOU STILL CARRY HIM
IN YOUR HEART. DON'T YOU?
I CARRY YOU
IN MY HEART, JIM
I LOVE YOU. CAN'T YOU SEE THAT?
I LOVE YOU.
YOU COULDN'T LOVE ME
AND BE AGAINST ME.
YOU'LL BOTH HAVE TO BE
VERY GOOD FOR JEFF.
AND SARAH BETH, DARLING.
YOU'LL TAKE CARE OF BRCK, WON'T YOU?
OH, DARLING, YOU'RE SO LITTLE.
YOU WON'T REMEMBER, YOU CAN'T.
I'LL REMEMBER.
THE COLONEL'S READY NOW, MRS. BREWTON.
CAN I GO FOR A RIDE TOO,
TOO, MAMA?
NOT TODAY, DARLING.
REMEMBER, I'LL BE BACK
SOONER THAN SOON,
WITH A DOUBLE
PRESENT FOR BOTH.
GOOD-BYE, JEFF.
YOU'VE BEEN A FRIEND.
DON'T YOU WORRY,
MRS. BREWTON.
SAY NICE THINGS ABOUT ME
TO MY CHILDREN, JEFF.
GOODBYE.
GOODBYE, DOC.
YOU BE GOOD.
READY?
DOC GAVE ME THIS
CHECK FROM YOU.
ALL ABOARD!
IS THIS THE WAY
WE SAY GOODBYE?
YOU SAID GOOD-BYE, LUTIE.
TWO YEARS AGO.
HE'S JUST TURNING
IN THE DOOR.
COME IN, JIM. GLAD YOU COULD
MAKE IT.
WHAT DID YOU GET ME
HERE FOR, DOC?
WELL, JIM, I GOT A FUNNY FEELING
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE GOING
TO BE KILLED.
BUT YOU TWO
CAN STOP IT.
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, DOC.
THE LAW'S GOING TO BE
ENFORCED. THAT'S ALL.
I'LL SEE YOU LATER DOC.
DON'T BE A FOOL, BREWTON.
GO AFTER HER.
I NEVER HAD A CHANCE.
I TRIED.
I TRIED IN DENVER
AND AGAIN YESTERDAY BEFORE SHE LEFT.
YOU WERE IN THE WAY.
YOU STILL ARE.
HI, COLONEL!
WE'RE ALL SET.
EVERYBODY'S ALL HERE, COLONEL-EVERY
COWMAN WHO COULD SET A HORSE.
THERE'S MORE AMMUNITION.
TELL THEM TO HELP THEMSELVES.
I'LL BE WITH YOU IN A MINUTE.
RIGHT. HERE'S MORE AMMUNITION,
BOYS. COME AND GET IT!
COME AND GET IT, BOYS!
THERE'S MORE AMMUNITION HERE.
MORE AMMUNITION HERE...
PHELPS, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
OUT HERE, PRACTICE MARCH?
NO, I WISH IT WERE.
I'M HERE TO SEE THAT THE
HOMESTEADERS ARE LET ALONE.
OH?
NOW, DON'T LOOK AT ME
LIKE THAT, JIM.
I'M A COWMAN MYSELF.
I SETTLED OUT HERE
THE SAME TIME YOU DID.
I DON'T LIKE THIS.
BUT MY ORDERS COME FROM
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
AND THEY SAY TO KEEP
THE PEACE OUT HERE.
SO I GUESS I'M GOING
TO HAVE TO TRY.
THAT SO?
THE MEN I'VE GOT ARE GOOD MEN.
THEY'LL DO AS THEIR ORDERS READ.
A LOT OF THEM MAY DIE.
YOU'VE GOT GOOD MEN, TOO.
LOOKS AS THOUGH
YOU OUTNUMBER US.
SO YOU'D PROBABLY
WIN TODAY.
BUT NOTHING WOULD STAY WON.
THEY'D SEND A REGIMENT OUT HERE
IF IT WAS NECESSARY AND
ALL YOUR MEN WOULD BE DEAD.
NOT ONLY YOU-YOU'VE GOT A RIGHT
TO DECIDE THAT YOURSELF-BUT THEM TOO.
AS I SAID BEFORE, JIM.
THEY'RE GOOD MEN.
THEY'RE REAL GOOD MEN.
WELL, BOYS, I'M AFRAID
WE'RE NOT GOING TO FIGHT,
UNLESS SOMEBODY FEELS
DIFFERENT ABOUT IT.
SO, I GUESS WE'LL JUST GO ON HOME.
MAYBE ONE OF THESE DAYS
WE'LL BE SORRY WE DID.
THEY CAN KEEP THE NESTOR FROM
BEING BLOWN AWAY
BUT ONLY
GOD CAN HELP THE PRAIRIE.
NOW, UM, UH, LET ME UNDERSTAND
THIS CLEARLY, MR. CRANE.
UH, YOU BELIEVE THAT I MAY BE
ABLE TO GAIN CUSTODY OF MY SON
BUT TO DO THIS, I MUST
ESTABLISH IN THE COURT
UNDER OATH THE IDENTITY OF HIS FATHER?
IN ORDER TO HAVE HIM
LEGALLY, IT'S THE ONLY WAY.
AND-AND IT IS ALSO YOUR OPINION
THAT IF I DO PROVE MY RIGHT TO HIM
I MAY FORFEIT MY RIGHT
TO MY DAUGHTER?
I'M AFRAID THAT'S
THE SIZE OF IT, LUTIE.
YOU WOULD, IN THE EYES
OF THE COURT, FOREVER PROVE
YOUR UNFITNESS TO HAVE HER.
BUT WITH LUCK,
YOU COULD HAVE BROCK.
YES, WITH LUCK, I'D
SUCCEED IN BRANDING ONE,
SEPARATING THEM
FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES.
I'M SORRY, LUTIE.
WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS?
ARE YOU GOING TO STAY
IN ST. LOUIS, MY DEAR?
WELL, I DON'T KNOW,
MR. CRANE.
SINCE MY FATHER DIED
I DON'T SEEM TO BELONG
HERE ANYMORE, EITHER.
GOOD-BYE. THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.
WRITE TO ME, DOC.
LET ME KNOW ABOUT MY BABIES.
HOW THEY ARE AND WHAT THEY DO.
KEEP IN TOUCH WITH ME PLEASE.
LOVE, LUTIE.
YOU ARE MISSED, LUTIE.
IT'S LIKE SOMEBODY BLEW OUT
A LIGHT, AND IT'S A LITTLE
DARKER FOR ALL OF US.
JIM HAD THE CHILDREN IN
THE OTHER DAY FOR ME TO LOOK OVER.
AND THEY'RE HEALTHY
AS GOATS.
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW
SALT FORK, LUTIE.
THE TOWN'S JAM-PACKED EVERY DAY.
STOREKEEPERS ARE TRUCKING
TO THE HOMESTEADERS, NOW.
HARDLY EVER SEE A CATTLEMAN
ANYMORE, UNLESS IT'S
WHEN THEY COME IN TO FIGHT
AND LOSE ONE OF THE
LAWSUITS THAT'S ALWAYS BEING
SLAPPED ON THEM BY FARMERS.
THE COURT THEREFORE
FIXES DAMAGES.
FOR THE FULL MARKET VALUE
OF THE MATURED CROP.
CHAMBERLAIN WAS HEARD
TO SAY THAT GOD WAS
ON THE SIDE OF THE HOMESTEADERS.
I DON'T KNOW AS I COULD SPEAK
FOR HIM BUT I'VE GOT TO
ADMIT THAT THE CROPS ARE GOOD.
THE HEADS ON THE WHEAT ARE
SO HEAVY, THEY'LL
KNOCK A MAN'S HEAD OFF.
AND THE CORN CAN SWALLOW UP
A HORSE AND RIDER.
THIS IS RICH LAND, ALL RIGHT.
AND THE SODBUSTERS ARE
REAPING ITS FIRST FLOWER.
MAYBE THAT WHAT GOD
ORDERED, I DON'T KNOW.
YOU ASK ABOUT JIM.
WELL, HE NEVER SAYS MUCH
BUT HIS BACK'S A LITTLE STRAIGHTER
AND HIS HEAD'S A
LITTLE HIGHER THAN EVER.
SARAH BETH FOLLOWS HER FATHER AROUND
LIKE SHE WAS A LONESOME PUP.
I GOT TO ADMIT THAT JIM TREATS
HER ABOUT LIKE SHE WAS A PUP.
NOT THAT HE ISN'T GOOD TO HER.
I GUESS IT'S THIS WAY.
SARAH BETH GIVES ALL TO JIM.
AND HE GIVES IT ALL
TO BROCK.
AND BROCK... WELL, BROCK'S LIKE
HE ALWAYS WAS-
TEMPER LIKE A BUZZ SAW
AND A SMILE LIKE A FEATHERED ANGEL.
OH DOC, I AM LONELY,
BUT I KNOW I SHOULD STAY AWAY, AND
I WILL JUST AS LONG AS I CAN.
JUST AS LONG AS I CAN.
DOC!
LUTIE! OH!
OH!
I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU.
RIG IS RIGHT OVER HERE.
IT'S ALL CHANGED.
YES...
TELL ME, LUTIE, WHY DID YOU REALLY COME?
JUST TO SEE THE CHILDREN?
THAT MOSTLY. IT'S BEEN
PRETTY BAD, DOC.
WHERE'S JIM?
WAITING AT THE HOTEL.
WAITING?
TO TAKE THE CHILDREN HOME
AFTER YOU'VE SEEN THEM.
OH. DID HE MIND
ABOUT MY SEEING THEM?
HE DIDN'T SAY ONE WAY
OR THE OTHER.
DOC... WHAT ABOUT JIM?
WHERE I'M CONCERNED, I MEAN? TELL ME.
HONEY, IT'S PRETTY HARD TO SAY.
HE'S JUST NEVER MENTIONED
YOUR NAME ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.
THANK YOU.
ALL RIGHT, MRS. SMITH.
DOC... THEY DON'T KNOW ME.
THEY'RE VERY YOUNG.
IT'S BEEN TWO YEARS,
LUTIE. YOU CAN'T EXPECT IT.
NO, I DON'T EXPECT IT.
I ONLY HOPED.
DO YOU REMEMBER? I SAID I'D BRING
A DOUBLE PRESENT FOR BOTH OF YOU?
DO YOU REMEMBER, SARAH BETH?
NO.
BUT YOU'D LIKE TO HAVE A PRESENT,
WOULDN'T YOU?
YES.
THEN YOU WAIT. AND LOOK AT
WHAT I HAVE IN MY BAG.
NOW, YOU LOOK IN THE BAG.
SAW HER OFF GETTING OFF THE TRAIN
AS BIG AS LIFE.
WENT RIGHT OVER TO DOC REID'S.
YOU MUST LEAVE
AT ONCE, BRICE.
DO YOU REALIZE I'VE NEVER EVEN
TOUCHED HIM BEFORE.
NEVER BEEN CLOSE ENOUGH TO LOOK
INTO HIS EYES. HE'S A FINE BOY.
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE COME HERE.
BROCK.
JIM.
COME ON, KIDS.
TIME TO GO NOW.
I'M SORRY, LUTIE.
I SHOULDN'T HAVE
COME BACK.
I'VE BROUGHT EVERYTHING
TO LIFE AGAIN.
AND THE CHILDREN, BRICE,
THEY DON'T KNOW ME.
I'M NOT SURE THEY EVEN
LIKE ME.
THEY WERE JUST WAITING
FOR THE TIME TO GO HOME.
THEY DON'T NEED ME. THEY DON'T
NEED ANYTHING FROM ME.
LISTEN TO ME, LUTIE.
YOU AND I, WE COULD
GET BROCK. HE'S OURS.
LET BREWTON HAVE
SARAH BETH.
WE COULD TAKE BROCK AWAY
HE BELONGS WITH YOU AND ME.
WE CAN GET AS FAR AWAY FROM HERE
AS TRAINS COULD CARRY US.
THIS IS OUR LAST
CHANCE, LUTIE.
THE LAST CHANCE
FOR THE 3 OF US.
I CAN'T GO AWAY WITH YOU, BRICE.
I CAN'T HAVE BROCK.
AND I CAN'T HAVE SARAH BETH.
SO I'M GOING TO GO,
BUT I'LL GO ALONE.
AND YOU'VE GOT
NOTHING FOR ME.
NOT ENOUGH, BRICE.
NOT ENOUGH FOR THAT.
COME ON IN.
DOC?
GLAD MACK GOT
YOU HERE, JIM.
HAVEN'T BEEN SEEING
VERY MUCH OF YOU LATELY.
I HAVEN'T BEEN
LOOKING FOR YOU.
SO I NOTICED.
I USED TO LOVE YOU
LIKE THE SON I NEVER HAD.
NOT ANYMORE.
YOU KNOW WHY?
MAYBE YOU BETTER
NOT TALK ABOUT IT NOW, DOC.
I GOT TO. I'LL TELL
YOU WHY-LUTIE.
I CAN SAY IT NOW-LUTIE.
YOU WOULDN'T LET ANYBODY
SPEAK HER NAME, WOULD YOU, JIM?
BUT YOU GOT TO HUMOR ME.
LAST WISH, YOU KNOW.
ALL LUTIE NEEDED WAS...
WAS A LITTLE HELP... FROM YOU.
SHE HAD BETTER COMING
THAN SHE GOT.
SHE NEVER FORGOT HER CHILDREN.
SHE WAS ALL RIGHT.
AND YOU SENT HER
AWAY TWICE. YOUR FAULT.
THAT'S RIGHT. YOURS.
PEOPLE DON'T TELL YOU THAT
MUCH, DO THEY, JIM?
JIM.
JIM!
DO YOU HEAR ME?
YES, DOC, I HEAR YOU.
YOU'LL-YOU'LL NEVER CHANGE.
YOU'VE STILL GOT THAT SAME
LOOK IN YOUR EYES.
YOU'LL NEVER CHANGE.
THE DOC... OUT OF HIS HEAD,
I GUESS, JIM.
NO. HE WAS RIGHT.
JUST RIGHT.
HE'S GONE GENTLEMEN.
COLONEL BREWTON,
I HAVE NO IDEA.
ARE YOU SURE?
VERY SURE.
I WONDER HOW SHE'S
FIXED FOR MONEY.
MR. CAMERON LEFT
VERY LITTLE.
I SEE.
I MIGHT ADD ONE THING.
IF I DID KNOW WHERE YOUR WIFE WAS
YOU ARE THE LAST ONE I WOULD TELL.
WHY DON'T YOU
LEAVE HER ALONE NOW?
BROCK! BROCK!
WAIT A MINUTE, SISTER
LET THEM-LET THEM FINISH!
JEFF! JEFF! BROCK'S FIGHTING AGAIN!
JEFF!
BROCK! STOP THAT FIGHTING!
HEY, ED, I'M BETTING ON THE
CHAMBERLAIN KID!
WHAT'S THAT YOU SAID?
YOU HEARD WHAT I SAID.
I'M BETTING ON THE CHAMBERLAIN KID.
YOU WANT TO COVER MY BET?
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE,
JEFF?
WHAT WAS SAID
HERE, BILL?
IF ANYBODY'S GOT
ANYTHING TO SAY
NOW'S THE TIME
TO SAY IT.
COME ON, BROCK.
DON'T WORRY, LUTIE.
I'LL KEEP ON
WRITING TO YOU.
I KNOW YOU'VE TURNED TO ME
ONLY BECAUSE DOC REID IS GONE.
AND THAT YOU WANT
NOTHING FROM ME
BUT NEWS OF YOUR CHILDREN.
IN THIS LETTER, I'M SENDING
YOU A LIKENESS OF SARA BETH AND BROCK.
I OBTAINED IT BY DEVIOUS METHODS
FROM THE LOCAL
PHOTOGRAPHER.
YOU ASK
ABOUT BREWTON, LUTIE.
I KNOW VERY LITTLE
ABOUT HIM.
HE SELDOM COMES TO TOWN,
EXCEPT TO DO SOME BUYING
FOR THE RANCH NOW AND THEN.
IT WOULD BREAK YOUR HEART
TO RIDE THROUGH THIS COUNTRY NOW, LUTIE.
IT'S ALL DRYING UP
AND BLOWING AWAY.
BREWTON WAS RIGHT ABOUT ONE THING.
THIS LAND WAS NOT READY FOR THE PLOW.
IT NEEDED HELP FROM US.
DURING THOSE FIRST YEARS
WHEN THE RAINS CAME,
WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT WORK
PLANNING AGAINST THE TIME
WHEN NATURE WOULD FAIL US.
WE SHOULD HAVE BUILT DAMS
AND BROUGHT OUR OWN RAIN
AND IRRIGATION DITCHES
AND CULVERTS AND DIVERTED STREAMS.
SOMEDAY WE WILL DO THESE THINGS
AND THE LAND WILL COME BACK.
THE HOPE OF SEEING THAT
KEEPS ME HERE.
AND SOMETHING ELSE
HOLDS ME, TOO.
BROCK IS GROWING UP, LUTIE,
AND THE WAY IT'S HAPPENING WORRIES ME.
WHEN SARAH WAS HOME,
SHE USED TO LOOK OUT FOR HIM.
BUT NOW THAT SHE'S AWAY
AT SCHOOL,
BREWTON MAKES NO MOVE
TO CURB BROCK IN ANYTHING.
IT'S ALMOST AS THOUGH HE WERE TRYING
TO MAKE UP TO HIM FOR SOMEONE ELSE.
YOU, LUTIE.
WHATEVER IT IS,
IT'S BAD FOR BROCK AND I DON'T LIKE IT.
BUT I'M FORCED TO STAND BY
HELPLESS TO DO ANYTHING,
AND WATCH THE WILDNESS
IN THE BOY GROW STRONGER.
EVERYONE LIKES HIM.
MAYBE THAT'S THE TROUBLE.
HE'S RIGHT AT HOME EVERYPLACE.
WHETHER HE'S JOSHING THE
GIRLS AT CLANCY'S DANCE HALL,
OR PLAYING THE BLUE DANUBE
ON MYRA NETHERWOODS' NEW GRAND PIANO.
HE'S A PRIME FAVORITE.
BUT HE'S A WALKING
CONTRADICTION, TOO.
ONE DAY HE'LL BE DEALING
WESTERN EUCHRE FROM THE BEST
HORSEHAIR FURNITURE IN TOWN,
AND THE NEXT HE'LL BE PRANCING
UP AND DOWN THE STREETS IN
HIS NEW RED-WHEEL BUGGY
WITH A HOMESTEADER GIRL
BESIDE HIM.
YOU MAY SEE HIM BUYING OUT
A SHOWCASE OF JAWBREAKERS
AT THE KINGMAN MERCANTILE CO.
FOR A BUNCH OF RUNNY-NOSED KIDS,
GENTLE AS A WOMAN,
OR KEEPING A TOMATO CAN ROLLING
AT 50 FEET WITH A SIX-SHOOTER.
IT GIVES ME PAUSE, LUTIE,
TO SEE HIM.
THERE'S SUCH A LOT OF RECKLESSNESS
UNDER THAT CRAZY CHARM.
THERE'S A DANGER IN HIM
AND A KIND OF VIOLENCE.
IT'S HARD FOR ME
TO KEEP MY HANDS OFF.
SOMETIMES WHEN HE LOOKS AT ME AS WE PASS
THERE'S NEVER MORE THAN
A FLICK OF HIS EYE-
I FEEL THAT HE MUST KNOW SOMETHING,
AND THAT HE MUST HATE ME FOR IT.
I UNDERSTAND SARA BETH GRADUATED
LAST WEEK WITH HIGH HONORS.
SARAH BETH BREWTON.
HAZEL SAWYER.
THEY TELL ME
SHE'LL BE HOME SOON.
I WONDER HOW SALT FORK
WILL SEEM TO HER NOW
AFTER HER YEARS OF SCHOOLING?
PARDON ME, MA'AM.
I'M LOOKING FOR A LITTLE, SAWED-OFF,
FRECKLED, UGLY RUNT OF A GIRL.
I'M LOOKING FOR
A HANDSOME YOUNG GENTLEMAN.
WELL, YOU FOUND WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR, BUT HOW ABOUT ME?
YOU WENT AND
CHANGED ON US.
OH, BROCK!
HELLO, SARAH BETH.
WHERE'S PAPA?
PAPA!
PAPA!
GOOD TO SEE YOU,
SARAH BETH.
OH, I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN
YOU'D BE LIKE THIS, BOTH OF YOU.
LIKE WHAT?
OH, GOOD-LOOKING.
A COUPLE OF YEARS DO A LOT FOR
A YOUNG LADY, DON'T THEY?
WHAT DID YOU EXPECT-
OF ME, I MEAN?
NOT AS MUCH
AS WE GOT, EH, BROCK?
NOT HALF. I DON'T KNOW THOUGH.
LOOKS STUCK UP TO ME
PROBABLY WON'T EVEN
LIKE OUR TOWN ANYMORE.
YOUR TOWN? MY TOWN.
OH HO. MAYBE YOU'LL DO,
HUH, COLONEL?
WELL, IT'S THE SAME OLD
PLACE. SAME...
YEAH. WELL, I'M GONNA LEAVE
YOU HERE.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
RIGHT HERE. CHARLEY'S.
CARDS ARE PRETTY HOT FOR ME TODAY.
YOU BETTER NOT GET FRESH WITH
CHARLEY. HE CAN TEACH YOU.
YEAH? CHARLEY SAID YOU WERE PRETTY
GOOD AT CARDS, BUT I WAS BETTER.
I CAN TAKE CHARLEY THE BEST
DAY HE EVER LIVED
WITH YOU STANDING
ON HIS SHOULDERS.
TRY IT ANYTIME YOU SAY, COLONEL,
ANYTIME AT ALL.
I'LL BET THE WOMEN
SPOIL HIM SILLY.
YEAH.
NOT ONLY THE WOMEN
EITHER.
JEFF SAYS HE CAN CHARM THE GOLD
RIGHT OUT OF YOUR TEETH.
HOW IS JEFF, PAPA?
WELL, HE'S LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE
AROUND HERE,
LOST HIS BITE.
NOT MUCH LIKE THE NIGHTGOWN YOU WORE
WHEN I PUT YOU TO BED.
OH, JEFF.
WELL, HOW DO YOU LIKE THE WAY
I FIXED UP YOUR ROOM, HONEY?
OH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
AIN'T IT, THOUGH?
I GOT MY IDEA FROM ONE OF THEM
MAGAZINES.
WELL, IF YOU WANT
ANYTHING, YELL.
OH, DON'T GO.
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.
I WANT TO KNOW
ABOUT BROCK.
WHAT YOU WANT TO KNOW?
OH, JUST HOW HE'S BEEN.
WHAT HE'S BEEN DOING.
SAME AS ALWAYS. BROCK'S BEEN HAVING
A GOOD TIME FOR BROCK.
WHAT YOU DOING?
WHERE'D THIS COME FROM?
I'VE BEEN SAVING IT.
WHY DON'T YOU ASK ME SOME MORE
QUESTIONS, SARAH BETH?
ABOUT WHAT?
ABOUT HER. AIN'T YOU CURIOUS ABOUT
YOUR MOTHER? YOU NEVER THINK OF HER?
WHAT FOR?
SHE'S YOUR MOTHER.
I DON'T KNOW
WHO SHE IS.
DON'T YOU EVER WONDER WHY
SHE'S NEVER COME TO SEE YOU?
YOU'VE ALWAYS TRIED TO SAY GOOD
THINGS ABOUT HER.
YOU'VE ALWAYS STUFFED YOUR EARS
WHEN I DID.
SHE GAVE UP A LOT WHEN SHE WENT AWAY.
AND SHE HASN'T GOT MUCH LEFT NOW.
HOW ABOUT PAPA?
HAS HE GOT ANYTHING LEFT?
HE'S GOT YOU.
HE'S GOT BROCK.
YEAH-BROCK.
PLEASE STOP WHISTLING.
10. I'LL RAISE YOU 20.
3 TREYS.
3 DEUCES
YOU CAN'T BEAT THAT, BOY.
NOBODY CAN BEAT THAT, KID.
THAT'S RIGHT, CHARLEY.
NOBODY EVER HAS. YOU OUGHT
TO KNOW THAT, BILL.
YEAH, I KNOW.
6. MISDEAL, ISN'T IT?
OH, HAVE YOU GOT 6, TOO?
5. I COULD HAVE USED ANOTHER.
LOOK, KID, GAMBLING IS MY BUSINESS.
YEAH.
AND I KNOW MY BUSINESS.
AFTER THIS, IF I'VE GOT 6 CARDS,
I'LL MAKE IT KNOWN.
SURE. YOU BET.
YOU DEAL.
ANY OF YOU BOYS SEEN CHAMBERLAIN
AROUND? JUDGE CHAMBERLAIN?
NO. WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH HIM?
HIS OFFICE WANTS HIM.
TRY THE BANK.
FORGET IT, JOE.
HE DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING.
IT'S ALL RIGHT, CHARLEY.
ALL RIGHT, KID.
YOU'RE THE JUDGE.
JUDGE OF WHAT?
GO AHEAD. DEAL.
3, JUDGE.
THANK YOU, JUDGE.
3 FOR THE JUDGE.
I'LL LET YOU OFF WITH A LIGHT SENTENCE.
PAIR OF 9s.
PAIR OF DOGS.
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD A TWIN
BROTHER, JUDGE.
ALL RIGHT, BROCK, THE DOOR'S OPEN.
TEMPORARY ANYHOW.
WHO OPENED IT
FOR ME, BILL?
SUPPOSE I OUGHT TO SAY THANKS.
I DON'T KNOW THE PARTY.
BROCK, YOU'RE HOME!
PAPA, BROCK'S HOME.
WELL, WERE YOU STILL AS LUCKY?
OH, SURE.
I'M ALWAYS LUCKY.
STOP THAT.
PLAY SOMETHING ELSE.
LIKE?
OH, ANYTHING BUT
THAT FUNERAL MARCH.
PLAY SOMETHING WITH PEOPLE IN IT.
CAN'T HAVE A FUNERAL
WITHOUT PEOPLE.
HAD DINNER?
YEAH, ATE AT BEATTY'S PLACE
ON THE WAY OUT.
BROCK SAID HE WAS LUCKY AGAIN, PAPA.
REALLY? THAT'S FUNNY.
LOOKS TO ME LIKE THE BOYS TOOK HIM.
THEY TRIED. I WAS PLAYING WITH
JOE HORTON.
HORTON? HE'S A BAD BOY. YOU
WANT TO LOOK OUT FOR HIM.
I DID, IN ONE HAND,
ESPECIALLY.
WE BOTH DREW ONE,
ONLY I DREW FIRST.
GOT HIM RIGHT
IN THE BELLY.
YOU MEAN
YOU SHOT HIM.
NOT CONCLUSIVELY.
HE'S GOING TO LIVE.
WHAT HAPPENED?
HOW'D THE FIGHT START?
AH, I HAD A FEW TOO MANY, I GUESS.
I DON'T REMEMBER.
I NEVER SAW YOU
THAT DRUNK.
THEN I'M A-LYIN'.
HOW LONG WERE YOU IN JAIL?
NOT LONG.
WHO GOT YOU OUT?
MCCURTIN?
HASN'T HE ALWAYS
BEFORE?
YEAH. WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO TELL
ME HOW THE FIGHT STARTED?
I TOLD YOU. I WAS DRUNK.
NOW, IF YOU'D RATHER I HADN'T
COME HOME, I'LL GET OUT.
I'D RATHER YOU DIDN'T LIE, BROCK.
NOW, COME ON, LET'S GO
INTO TOWN.
AND FACE WHATEVER'S
GOT TO BE FACED.
NOT ME. I'M GOING
TO DENVER.
YOU'RE GOING TO SALT FORK,
BROCK,
AND GET THIS THING OVER WITH
AND THEN YOU'RE COMING BACK HERE.
AND IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA
IF YOU SPENT A LITTLE MORE TIME
HERE IN THE FUTURE.
YOU CAN'T RUN ME
ANYMORE!
I WASN'T CUT OUT FOR LIVING YOUR WAY
AND I'M SICK OF TRYING.
I'D RATHER BE STUFFED
IN A COFFIN!
I DON'T MIND THE SHOOTING SO MUCH-
I WOULDN'T GIVE MUCH FOR YOU IF
YOU COULDN'T DEFEND YOURSELF-
BUT JUMPING BAIL IS ANOTHER THING.
IT ISN'T SQUARE.
I WANT YOU TO GO INTO TOWN
AND STAND TRIAL ON YOUR OWN FEET.
CLEAR YOURSELF OR TAKE
THE CONSEQUENCES.
BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
TO WORK IT OUT, BROCK.
WHEN YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING MORE
TO SAY TO ME, I'LL BE AROUND.
THAT WAS NICE.
THAT WAS FINE.
TAKE IT EASY.
YOU KNOW YOU CAN
HURT HIM MORE THAN ANYONE.
YOU KNOW THAT, DON'T YOU?
TAKE IT EASY, SARAH BETH.
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE LEAVING.
I GOT TO THINK.
HOW CAN A MAN THINK
WITHOUT A LITTLE MUSIC?
JIM HERE?
AROUND SOME PLACE.
OUT BACK, I GUESS.
WHERE'S BROCK?
HELLO, MR. MCCURTIN.
YOU TELL HIM ABOUT
THE SHOOTING, BROCK?
OH, HELLO, MACK.
SURE I TOLD HIM. WHAT'S THE MATTER?
HORTON DIED.
FIGURED HE WAS
TOO MEAN TO DIE.
I CAN GET YOU OFF
ONCE MORE, MAYBE.
YOU MUST HAVE HAD A GOOD REASON
TO SHOOT A MAN.
YOU HAD ONE,
DIDN'T YOU?
GOOD REASON?
WHY, SURE-THE BEST.
BETTER COME BACK IN WITH ME.
HAVE YOU TOLD
THE COLONEL?
I CAN'T FACE HIM.
I'VE GONE THAT ONE TIME OVER
BRINGING HIM BAD NEWS.
ARE YOU COMING?
NO.
THEN I'M FINISHED, BROCK,
AS FAR AS YOU'RE CONCERNED.
TOO MUCH FOR ME.
ONE LAST WORD-
I ADVISE YOU TO GET IN TOWN FAST.
SARAH BETH, TELL YOUR FATHER
I COULDN'T WAIT.
YOU CAN GET OUT OF THIS YOURSELF OR
THE WAY YOU GOT OUT OF JAIL.
WHAT DID MR. MCCURTAIN MEAN,
"THE WAY YOU GOT OUT OF JAIL"?
HE GOT YOU OUT, DIDN'T HE?
NO.
WHO DID?
CHAMBERLAIN.
I GUESS HE FIGURES
THE YOUNG AND FOOLISH
SHOULD HAVE ANOTHER CHANCE,
OR SOMETHING.
ALL RIGHT, BROCK, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO COVER UP WITH ME.
I'VE KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME.
WHEN?
FOR SURE WHEN I WAS 15.
HOW?
A LOT OF THINGS
PUT TOGETHER.
AND BEFORE I WENT BACK TO SCHOOL
THE LAST TIME, I KNEW YOU KNEW IT
AND I KNEW PAPA DID.
I COULD KILL CHAMBERLAIN.
THAT'S WHAT THE
TROUBLE WAS ABOUT.
THIS FELLOW I WAS GAMBLING WITH,
HE SAID A FEW THING.
THAT'S WHY I COULDN'T
TELL THE COLONEL.
I COULDN'T LET HIM
KNOW THAT I KNOW.
OH, BROCK.
WE'VE BEEN AROUND A LOT
TOGETHER, THE COLONEL AND ME.
AND HE NEVER LET ANYBODY
EVEN THINK ANYTHING ONCE,
AT LEAST NOT OUT LOUD.
DON'T I KNOW.
I'M GLAD I KNOW THAT, TOO-
I MEAN, THAT YOU LOVE HIM.
IF I HATED HIM,
I'D BE ALL RIGHT.
THEN WE COULD WALK DOWN
THE STREET TOGETHER
AND I WOULDN'T MIND FEELING
HIM CRINGE-NEVER LET ON.
OH, I SHOULD HAVE GONE Movie AWAY
FROM HERE A LONG TIME AGO.
BUT HE'S HARD TO LEAVE.
NOW I GOT TO GET
OUT OF HERE FAST.
DON'T RUN AWAY, BROCK.
MR. MCCURTIN COULD GET
YOU OFF, COULDN'T HE?
OH, SURE, EASY. THE JURY WOULDN'T
EVEN LEAVE ITS BOX.
THEN FACE IT LIKE
PAPA WANTS YOU TO.
EVER BEEN TO A TRIAL,
SARAH BETH?
LOTS OF THINGS COME OUT OF TRIALS.
WHOLE MESS COMES OUT.
SALT FORK WOULD EAT
THIS UP WITH A SPOON,
AND HE'S HAD ENOUGH.
GO ON, SARAH BETH, SIT DOWN AND
PLAY A TUNE BY YOURSELF.
YOU'LL HAVE TO GET USED TO IT.
AND TELL THE COLONEL NOTHING.
JEFF SAID MCCURTIN WAS HERE.
WHAT DID HE WANT?
NOTHING.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
FIRST LAP OF
MY TRIP TO DENVER.
GET DOWN OFF THAT HORSE, BROCK.
GET OUT OF MY WAY.
WELL, SARAH BETH, I'LL TRY TO
UNDERSTAND WHY HE HAD TO GO.
I DIDN'T TRY WITH SOMEONE
ELSE A LONG TIME AGO.
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN SORRY.
WELL, COLONEL, THEN
IF BROCK AIN'T HERE
WE JUST GOTTA FIND HIM
AND TAKE HIM IN.
WHY?
I THOUGHT MCCURTIN
TOLD YOU.
HORTON DIED.
SORRY, COLONEL.
THINGS FALL THAT WAY
SOMETIMES, BILL.
YEAH.
YOU SURE HE AIN'T HERE?
YOU CAN LOOK.
I... I SHOULDN'T HAVE ASKED THAT,
COLONEL. GOOD NIGHT.
WHY IS BROCK FRIGHTENED, SARAH BETH?
DOESN'T HE KNOW MACK CAN GET HIM OFF?
BUT HE KNOWS HE CAN'T GET
YOU OFF.
THE MAN BROCK SHOT,
HE CALLED BROCK NAMES.
NOT PRETTY NAMES,
EITHER.
THEY'D SOUND AWFUL AT A TRIAL,
ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE TRUE.
BROCK THOUGHT-HE WANTED TO
SPARE YOU SOMETHING.
HE CAN'T SPARE ME
ANYTHING.
IT SEEMS NONE OF US CAN
SPARE THE OTHERS ANYTHING.
YOU GO TO BED.
I'VE GOT TO FIND HIM.
I'VE GOT TO GET TO HIM
BEFORE HE DOES SOMETHING.
I'VE GOT TO GET TO HIM
BEFORE SOME SHERIFF GETS HIM.
HE'S A GOOD BOY,
SARAH BETH.
YES. I'M GLAD WE KNOW HOW GOOD.
YOU FIND HIM, PAPA.
I'LL FIND HIM.
GET YOUR AFTERNOON STAR-
HERE'S YOUR CHANGE, LADY.
LATEAFTERNOON STAR.
THANK YOU, SIR.
RIGHT OVER HERE-
GET YOUR LATE AFTERNOON STAR!
AFTERNOON STAR! LATEST NEWS AND
THE LATEST PAPER!
RIGHT HERE. THAT THE IDEA.
THANK YOU, SIR.
LATE AFTERNOON STAR!
RIGHT OVER HERE! GET
YOUR LATE AFTERNOON STAR!
HERE COMES THE COLONEL.
HE'S IN THAT
CABIN, COLONEL.
YOU CAN'T GO DOWN THERE, COLONEL!
THE BOY'S GONE CRAZY!
GO ON BACK!
NO ONE'S TAKING ME, AND
THAT GOES FOR YOU, TOO!
STAY THERE, OR I'LL DROP
YOU! I MEAN IT!
YOUR LAST CHANCE
TO TURN AROUND!
I'LL COUNT 3!
HURRY IT UP!
OH, DAD. WHY AM I
CALLING YOU DAD?
YOU USED TO CALL
ME THAT, BROCK.
NOT SINCE I GOT OLD
ENOUGH TO KNOW BETTER.
GROWING UP-THAT'S
GREAT, ISN'T IT?
DON'T TALK.
DON'T TALK.
YOU DON'T SCARE
WORTH A NICKEL, DAD.
DOCS ALWAYS TRY SOMETHING.
LIE STILL, KID.
LIE STILL. NOT WHILE I'M STILL
BREATHING IN AND OUT.
LYING STILL COMES LATER.
NOT MUCH LATER, THOUGH,
HUH, DOC?
HELLO, SHERIFF!
SOMEBODY LEFT
A NOTE FOR YOU.
RIGHT SIDE OF YOU.
BROCK.
YOUR SISTER SENDS
HER LOVE, SON.
THE GOOD GIRL.
GOOD, BRIGHT GIRL.
SHE TOLD ME, BROCK.
SHE TOLD ME WHY YOU
DUCKED OUT.
AND, BROCK...
YOUR MOTHER...
THERE'S SOMETHING...
DAD, LET'S GO DOWN
TO CHARLEY'S, HMM?
LET'S DRINK ALL THE PLACE
UNDER THE TABLE.
AND THEN WHEN THERE'S
JUST ME AND YOU LEFT
I'LL DRINK YOU UNDER.
ASK CHARLEY.
HOW ABOUT IT?
DA-DAD...
DAD.
I GOT IT FOR YOU,
LAST STOP, MA'AM.
GOT ANYTHING
FOR ME TO PICK UP?
NO. NOTHING TODAY.
I BEG YOUR PARDON, IS THERE
A TRAIN LEAVING
FOR SAN FRANCISCO TOMORROW?
ONE AT 11:00 O'CLOCK TONIGHT.
THANK YOU.
AND SO WE'LL COME TO
PAY OUR LAST RESPECTS
AND TO SAY GOODBYE
TO BROCK BREWTON
BELOVED SON OF JAMES BREWTON
AND LUTIE C. BREWTON.
THIS YOUNG MAN HAS
DEPARTED FROM OUR MIDST.
THE LORD GAVE.
THE LORD HATH TAKEN AWAY.
LET US PRAY.
COME IN.
JUST PUT THE COFFEE
ON THE TABLE, PLEASE.
YOU'RE SARAH BETH.
YES.
PLEASE SIT DOWN.
THERE'S NO NEED
FOR THAT.
I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY, AND THEN
I'M GOING TO GO.
HOW DID YOU KNOW
I WAS HERE?
I HAVE A ROOM AT THE HOTEL.
THE CLERK TOLD ME.
I'M NOT GOING TO LET YOU HURT
POP ANYMORE!
HE CAN'T STAND ANYMORE.
MAYBE YOU COULDN'T HURT HIM,
EVEN IF YOU TRIED.
MAYBE THERE'S NOT ANYTHING THAT
CAN HURT HIM,
NOT AFTER BROCK.
I HOPE SO.
BECAUSE NOBODY CAN STAND
ANYMORE, EVEN HIM.
SO MAYBE THE PAIN'S
OVER NOW.
UNLESS YOU BROUGHT HIM MORE.
HAVE YOU?
WHAT DO YOU
WANT OF HIM?
NOTHING.
I CAME TO HELP BROCK.
I DIDN'T KNOW HE-
I... I DIDN'T KNOW UNTIL THE TRAIN
WAS ALMOST HERE.
I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO SEE
YOUR FATHER, SARAH BETH.
I MIGHT TRY IF I THOUGH
I COULD MAKE UP
A LITTLE TO HIM. AND TO YOU FOR
ALL THE YEARS,
BUT I KNOW I COULDN'T.
HE TRIED TO TELL ME
HOW HE FELT,
HOW THE GRASS WAS SOMEHOW
GODLY TO HIM.
HE TRIED TO TELL ME
AND I DIDN'T HEAR.
AND HE WAS RIGHT.
THOSE YEARS ARE GONE,
AND MY CHANCE WITH HIM.
I'LL LEAVE TONIGHT, SARAH BETH,
BUT I'M NOT SORRY
I CAME NOW,
BECAUSE I'LL TAKE SOMETHING
BACK WITH ME
WHICH MEANS
A GREAT DEAL TO ME:
THE KNOWLEDGE
THAT HE HAS YOU-
YOU TO FIGHT FOR HIM,
BE THERE WHEN HE NEEDS YOU,
TO BE WHAT I WASN'T
STRONG ENOUGH TO BE.
HE DIDN'T COME TO ST. LOUIS
FOR NOTHING.
AND NOW, WHEN HE'S LOST
IT ALL, EVERYTHING,
WHEN HE NEEDS SOMETHING
HUMAN AT LAST,
YOU COME INTO THE FIELD.
NO, HE DIDN'T COME
TO ST. LOUIS FOR NOTHING.
AND ALL AT ONCE
THAT GIVES ME... PEACE.
A KIND OF HAPPINESS EVEN.
I HAVEN'T FELT THAT
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.
JUST ONE THING.
SOME NIGHT WHEN HE'S SITTING
ON THE PORCH, SARAH BETH,
GIVE HIM A KISS FROM ME.
OH, DON'T...
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HOME, COLONEL.
THE BUCKBOARD WITH
SARAH BETH GET IN?
I MISSED SEEING HER START.
MAYBE YOU'D BETTER
GO ON IN THE HOUSE, COLONEL.
SARAH BETH?
PAPA, COME HERE.
PAPA, COME HERE.
MOTHER WANTED TO BE
WAITING FOR YOU HERE, PAPA.
THE WAY SHE USED TO BE.
LUTIE?
YOU'RE WELL?
YES, JIM.
AND YOU?
YOU LOOK AS YOU ALWAYS DID.
DO I, JIM?
PAPA.
IT WAS A HARD THING
FOR HER TO GO THROUGH,
BUT SHE'S ONE
IN A THOUSAND.
NO ONE ELSE WILL EVER BE LIKE HER.

BLOOD ON THE MOON
Who's that?
Put a light on yourself.
With what?
Man, man. I didn't know anyone was here.
- Well, I had a fire.
- I couldn't have stopped 'em if I'd seen it.
I don't think I've seen you around here before, have I?
Nope.
- You c ome over the peaks?
- Yeah. With an outfit.
What are you doing here?
I'm waiting for you to clear out of my camp.
Then I'll gonna turn in, if I can find my blankets.
My camp just below.
Maybe you better come along.
We can make it double that far.
I guess I can do with a cup of coffee.
Hey it's me, Bart.
Who is he?
I don't know.
I was bringin' my gather down the creek when they cleaned out his camp.
So I brought him along.
You come over the peaks?
That's right.
Why didn't you come to the pass?
There's no law says a man has to stick to a wagon road, is there?
My men caught your horse.
It's branded "Lazy J".
I don't know it.
Don't you?
Wait a minute, Cap.
Make a fellow feel right at home don't you?
All right my name is Lufton,
John Lufton.
This is Cap Willis, my foreman.
A month ago, nobody would've asked you any questions.
It's different now.
Who are you?
Jim Garry. "Lazy J" is Texas brand.
Headed for Sun Dust?
That's right.
You know anybody there?
Nope.
Alright. I apologize for my steers.
We'll replace your outfit.
Make yourself comfortable.
Give him something to eat, Joe.
- Rotten night.
- Yeah.
Sorry we have to be so rough on you Garry, but you're a loose rider.
We gotta watch them these days.
- Little argument over grazing land.
- Oh.
Yeah. For five years now, I've been supplying the beef to feed the Indians here on the Reservation.
This year they've got new agent.
Fellow named Pindalest.
He's rejected my beef and he's kicking me off the Reservation grass.
That doesn't explain about the loose riders.
No, but I haven't got any graze to move to except what I used to claim in the Basin across the river.
And there seems to be a little difference of opinion now as to who owns that.
Me or the homesteaders that have been drifting in.
I'm moving back.
They'll fight.
Yeah, I reckon they will.
A newcomer moved in this summer.
He's got 'em organized.
Name's Riling.
Still doesn't explain about the loose riders.
He's bringing in gun men.
Nobody can blame you for being careful.
I'm afraid you don't get it.
- Get what?
- This.
It's work for me or - keep on riding.
And if I don't?
I'll give you a day in Sun Dust and then you'd better drift.
Sleep on it, Garry.
Much obliged for the outfit.
Working for me Garry?
No, I guess I'll be drifting.
Well, it's your choice.
D'you mind dropping a note at Block house with my women folk?
That's my place over in the Basin.
It's on your way.
Glad to.
Thanks.
Good luck.
Hold it! I'm riding through.
Come on out and talk.
Don't care who you kill, do you?
Maybe that'll cool you off.
- Got a note from John Lufton.
- I'm Carol Lufton.
- You're working for us now?
- No.
Bringing herd across river at Rock Ford tonight. - Dad</ I>
Did Dad say when he was coming down from the Reservation?
- No, ma'am.
- Thank you.
Stop right there.
You're the man that shot at me by the river.
Yeah, I guess I am.
Well I'm gonna show you how it feels.
Put that gun down, Amy.
Amy stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it! You hear?
Have you gone crazy?
- What's going on here?
- Ask him.
I was only giving him back a little of what he gave me.
- What about it?
- She's right.
Why has Dad had to guard at the river for a week if it isn't to keep the riders from crossing?
- What are you doing here?
- He brought a note from Dad.
Well, I tried to tell her but she wouldn't give me a chance.
Alright you delivered the note.
Now, get out.
Well, for once you bit off more than you can chew.
- That him?
- Yeah, what do you think?
- Hmm, maybe.
- Maybe my foot, Manker! You gotta get hit on the head with it?
- Lufton threatened to get one, didn't he?
- Well you ain't sure it's him.
I cut his sign going into Lufton's ranch this morning and I cut it going out.
John Lufton's got a right to hire a range detective if he wants to, Milo.
Not to watch us, he ain't.
Well, let Riling handle it.
And no shooting.
Take the third stall.
The boy'll bring you some hay.
Any idea who that fellow is?
"Lazy J" is the brand but I don't know it.
He say anything?
- He asked where he could find Tate Riling.
- Riling?
- I'll take it at the table Barney.
- Sure.
Lufton's watcher just drifted in.
- Cattle detective?
- What else?
- He asked for Riling.
- Riling?
If he's Lufton's watcher, what d'you figure he wants with Riling?
Let's find out.
Yeah. Why not?
But how? Riling ain't here.
Sure he is.
Where?
Right here. Eh, Nels?
Well, let's wait 'til Riling gets here.
We wouldn't want to make no mistake.
Alright, Nels.
Maybe you want the law to come in here and find out what we're planning to do.
So he can go back and tell Lufton.
Alright, Milo, alright.
I'll tell Barney.
Know where I can find Tate Riling?
Back table.
Ace, Queen, Mitch.
Tate Riling?
That's me.
I'd like to talk to you.
Go ahead.
These are my friends.
I'm looking for a riding job.
Who said I was hiring riders?
I heard it.
You hear what I'm hirin' them for?
I heard that too.
Why yes.
Dumb play boys.
Stay set Army.
He's headin' for the street.
Mr. Riling, Lufton's watcher's in town.
Asking for you.
And he wanted a ridin' job with us, Tate.
- Then go get him.
- There he is.
Jim Garry!
Hello, Tate.
This is Jim Garry. The man I sent for.
He's no range detective.
What went wrong, Jim? What Happened?
Who started this?
Ask these jokers here, Tate.
If that's Garry, what's he doing at Lufton's?
Were you at the Lufton's place?
Yeah he was. I seen him.
That's right. I delivered a not from him to his women folk.
What about it?
Well it's Lufton's outfit that's tryin' to run us out of the country, Jim.
Am I supposed to know that?
Why no. I forgot.
I never wrote Jim about our fight with Lufton.
I told him I needed him and asked him to come on up.
Now stop chewin' leather and go and get yourself a drink.
Sam old Jim, when lightning strikes you're there.
It wasn't a fair test.
Come on, let's get you a room.
It's good to see you again Jim.
I wasn't sure you'd come.
I'm here.
Yeah. I heard things haven't been breaking too good lately.
Well, that's a bootless job - trail driving.
I told you that we split up two years ago.
Understand you fin'lly got your own herd.
And two weeks later I saw 'em strung out along the bottomlands. Dead of the Fever.
We'll forget it. There's money in this deal.
Big money.
- Barney, how about a room for my friend here?
- Sure.
I wouldn't wish one on him if was a friend of mine though.
Oh. This has got your name on it.
Somebody fired it through the back window during the ruckus.
We're goin' out tonight fellows.
I know where Lufton's crossing.
- How do you know?
- Never mind, I know.
Be ready to leave in half an hour.
Drink up, Jim.
Wait here, I'll be right back.
I suppose you'd like to know what this is all about?
I have been kinda wondering, yeah.
Well I'm not gonna tell you, Jim.
I'm gonna show you.
Come in.
Jim, this is Mr. Pindalest. United States agent for the Ute Indians over at the Reservation
This is Jim Garry, my partner.
How do you do?
You didn't tell me before about a partner.
Well I'm telling you now.
Before we go on any further,
I want to understood how he'll figure in this.
You mean money?
Don't worry Pindalest.
I'll share with Jim.
Hmm.
Well, here's the, uh, item we were talking about the other day.
Think you'll find it satisfactory.
United States dollars are usually satisfactory, aren't they?
Now look. I told you Garry is my partner, Pindalest.
What I know, he knows..
So relax and sit down.
No, I won't stay.
Scared?
Scared?
Just cautious, Riling.
Well that's our partner, Jim.
Cautious...
And this is our working capital, courtesy of the United States Government.
There's enough there to buy me 2,500 head of Lufton's beef, four dollars a head.
That's cheap enough, isn't it?
It's too cheap. Where is the catch?
There isn't any.
You, um, met Lufton, you say?
Yeah, I camped with him last night.
Did he tell you that Pindalest has ordered his cattle off the Reservation?
Yeah. He said he'd refused his beef.
And did he tell you that the army from Fort Liggett, has orders to seize the cattle if they're not off the Reservation by the first of November?
No he didn't tell me that.
Well that's the layout Jim.
I've organized these two bit ranchers to fight any move Lufton makes to push his herd across the river and into the Basin here.
The ranchers'll fight because they figure they're fighting for their own range.
But the truth is, they'd be fighting for me.
Now withut any graze to move to,
Lufton'll be caught on the Reservation and his herd seized.
So what does he do?
Sell?
To me. Cheap.
Because he'd rather get a little money than lose everything.
Sounds like you've got him over a barrel.
I have!
I buy 'em cheap and sell 'em back to the Government through Pindalest for full contract price.
Your cut will be ten thousand dollars.
What do I have to do to earn it?
Lufton's tough. My ranchers aren't.
You'll make up the difference.
I see.
I've mixed up a lot of things, Tate.
But up to now, I've never been hired for my gun.
Can you afford to be particular?
No I guess I can't.
Now you're talking, Jim.
I'll meet you down in the lobby in 10 minutes.
Come on, slow poke.
Don't you want to know if Dad got across?
Of course.
What's the matter?
Did I get you out the bed too early?
I'm worried about dad.
I hope he didn't have trouble crossing last night.
Could only be trouble if Riling found out about it.
Nobody's crossed here.
Looking for someone, Miss Lufton?
So you're one of 'em?
- I guess dad wasn't so wrong about you after all.
- Wrong?
He must've spotted you for one of Riling's gun men the minute he saw you.
Funny isn't it Riling?
But not to you. By now Dad's probably got his herd across the river some place else while you wait here at Rocky Ford to throw him back.
- Is that why we're here?
- Isn't it?
Simply because Dad was smart enough to give this saddle tramp a not that he was sure to read.
He knew he'd tell you and decoy you over here.
How do you like it now, Kris?
You and your son?
Why you aren't even being led by a smart crook.
We're only fighting for what belongs to us, Miss Amy.
You didn't fight for it before Riling gave you the idea.
Why didn't you talk to dad, Kris?
Talk to him.
You use to work for him.
You know he's not unreasonable.
Call it unreasonable to kick us off our land?
I don't believe I've seen you around here before.
- You fighting for your own graze too?
- No ma'am.
And you?
I thought you were all old timers, fighting for land you settled on, Kris?
At least that's in the open now.
Paid gunmen against working riders.
You did read that note, didn't you?
No.
You're a poor liar.
Yes.
Well. Lufton's across the Massacre.
John Lufton's no fool, mister.
Garry did not read that note.
- Then where did you get the tip?
- None of your business, Milo.
I got a wrong tip and I won't get another.
Well if you don't like it, Milo.
Just ride it on out.
Lufton's across the river with that herd.
Yeah, sure. But steers have got legs.
They can be driven back.
The thing to do is find 'em before Lufton can get 'em scattered.
After that we can move.
Didn't you notice how them four always stick together?
Why not?. Reardan and Shotten work for Riling.
Garry's a friend just came in to help.
I can buy me that kind of a friend for $75 a month and no questions asked.
You know, Lufton's smart.
Yeah he's smart enough to spot me.
He had spotted Shotten and Reardan before I even knew they were there.
They are a couple of beauties.
Who are they?
Doesn't matter who they are, Jim.
The thing that matters is, they don't scare easy.
Well, it's pretty crude.
Not so crude.
I've made everybody swallow it but Lufton, and I'll make him swallow it too.
Shotten, Reardan and me.
Hired gunmen.
Shotten and Reardan will get paid in gold eagles.
You get paid in thousands.
Yeah. Only difference between us is the price.
All right boys, cut for town.
I'll be in touch with you.
Tate, I didn't know it was a trick of Dad.
I swear I didn't. Until I heard Amy say it.
Of course you didn't, darling.
Forget it.
It's done and now we've got to fix it.
But I'm glad in a way.
I couldn't bear it this morning when I though you and Dad were fighting.
It isn't for you, Carol.
But I have to do what I'm doing.
You see that, don't you?
- Yes, Tate.
- You see, I'm a poor man, darling.
Money has to come hard to me.
Nothing for me to do but join up with men just like myself and fight for what little I've got.
I tried to make Dad see both sides.
But he's just as sure he's right as you homesteaders are.
We've got to fight.
But he's across now.
What are you gonna do?
I'm not gonna ask you to risk your dad's life, darling.
But I am going to ask you to help.
Find out where he's holding the herd that he crossed. and get word back to me as soon as you can.
You won't let any harm come to Dad, won't you?
You know you can trust me, darling.
Still a lot easier when we go through the gap.
- We ought to make it by noon.
- Yes.
I scatter 'em in the scrub pinion west of Avery's patch.
Amy!
What the devil are you doing here?
You didn't think I'd stay home when you're this close.
This is no place for you.
I told Bart to tell you girls I'd be home by noon.
I told 'em and it didn't do no good.
She was bent on coming along.
I couldn't wait.
All right, Cap, get 'em started.
Bart says you crossed without any trouble?
Yeah. We're primed for it but didn't come.
I think I know why.
Did a rider name of Garry drift into the ranch yesterday with a note?
You mean that hired gunman of Riling's?
So I had him pegged right.
Too bad, he was a nice seeming fellow.
Too nice to read that note.
But he did.
Do you think this Garry's a killer?
Joined up with Riling, didn't he?
Get out of here, Amy!
I'll make Riling remember this.
They'll run 'till they're worn out.
Four days to the deadline.
It'll take us a week to round 'em up and get 'em off the Reservation again.
It's young Barden.
I hope it wouldn't come to this.
Just a month ago me and him went to a shindig together.
Yeah, he was a nice boy.
Well, what do you want?
It's about your Barden.
He was killed on the raid.
I figured maybe that's what happened when he didn't come home.
I was with him when he got hit.
Nothing I can do.
It's a big price to pay for a little bit of graze.
Too bad you had to get mixed up in this fight, Barden.
I joined up with the other small ranchers
'cause I figured their fight was my fight.
We ain't being paid to fight, mister.
I'm sorry about your son, Mr. Barden.
You can believe that if you want to.
Sure. Sure.
I've lived here more than of half my life with my wife and my son.
She died about four years ago.
And now...
Now he's gone.
Go on in the Hotel, Amy.
I told you to ride on through.
- So you did?
- You're time's up, get started.
- Get out of here, Amy.
- No.
- Go on into the hotel.
- No.
Don't move, Lufton.
Your drift, Shotten.
Get that girl out of there.
I said, drift.
What are we waitin' for?
But this is what Riling wants.
He said so.
That's your horse, Reardan.
Get moving.
I ain't taking orders from you.
All right, Reardan. Any time you want.
Make up your mind.
I won't wait.
You won't be this lucky next time, Lufton.
I don't get it, Garry.
I just don't get it.
You're riding on, aren't you?
I'm glad. Not for us, but for you.
I want to thank you for this.
I want to apologize too, for what I said to you.
Don't let a man's whim fool you.
I haven't.
COMMISSARY
12 MILES
What do you want, amigo?
Whiskey.
Would you be looking for me?
I ain't looking for anybody, mister.
Is that you, Kris?
I heard about Fred.
I'm sorry, Kris.
I'll make Lufton pay for that.
What good'll that do? Fred's...
Fred's dead.
It'll make me feel better.
Did you come all the way over here to tell me that?
No. I missed you this morning.
I didn't know you'd be here.
Why are you?
I'm leavin' the country.
But Kris, the fight's almost won.
Lufton's herd is stampeded half way up the Three Braves.
Who cares?
Hey Jim, where have you been?.
I've searched the country for you.
How'd you find me?
Settlemeir said you took the Commissary road.
I took a chance.
What's up?
Let's have a drink. I've got news.
Give me a glass and a handful of cigars and then get out.
On the level, Jim.
What are you doing here?
Running out.
Any reason?
Two. Shotten and Reardan.
I never heard of you running away from a pair like that.
- Well, I. I never did.
- Then why?
They were gonna kill Lufton in cold blood when I stepped in.
I'm glad you did.
Are you?
Jim, what's eatin' you?
Why we've got more at stake here than a bag of marbles.
You mean, you have.
Jim, Lufton isn't dead.
He isn't even hurt.
And after that stamped he hasn't got a chance.
- Then why bother about me?
- Because, I need you.
You don't think Lufton'll do business with me, do you?
No.
No he'd rather lose his herd.
Exactly.
But today you stepped in and saved his life.
He won't forget that.
So when you ride up with an offer, he'll take it.
Because he has to.
Why not?
It's, something you wouldn't understand.
Try me.
It starts with your double cross of a bunch of poor jugheaded homesteaders and the hiring of gun hands.
It goes on to you making love to man's daughter to get her to turn against her own father.
And your try for Lufton yesterday...
It goes past that to the death of Kris Barden's son.
And it winds up right here. with Reardan waitin' outside to see if I go with you or he shoots me in the back.
I've seen dogs that wouldn't claim you for a son, Tate.
All right, get off.
I said, get off.
Hold it.
Give him time.
Can you make it to your horse?
Get out.
Why'd you do it?
I always wanted to shoot one of you and he was the handiest.
Get out.
What are you doing here?
I want to see Lufton.
Why you dirty saddle stiff!
Get out of here, quick.
Lufton'll have to run me off.
I don't need orders from him to cut down on you, Now get out!
What is it?
I'm looking for your father.
- Oh he's...
- Careful Miss Amy.
It don't matter to him where your father is.
It's all right, Ted.
That's a bad cut.
Come inside. I'll fix it.
Sit down.
Tate Riling?
Is he - dead?
No.
I keep remembering what you said yesterday in Sun Dust.
Was this a whim, too?
This business with Riling?
It was a pleasure.
What brings you back?
Gall, for one thing, John.
I got in a little jangle with Riling down at Commissary last night.
I'm through with him.
- Well?
- You may not believe me, Lufton
I want to tell you what you're up against.
Then it's up to you.
I already know what I'm up against.
You don't know that Pindalest aims to buy your herd, do you?
He rejected it.
He won't reject it when Riling offers it to him.
Sure. Riling and Pindalest planned it together.
Pindalest's part of the deal was to order you off the Reservation.
Riling was to prime the homesteaders to keep you out of the Basin.
Do you figure you can round up your stuff and cross it before the deadline?
- No
- And rather than let the Army take 'em you'd sell and take the loss wouldn't you?
Not to Riling.
But to a stranger like me with cash in his pockets.
That's the deal. I was supposed to make the offer with Riling's money.
I don't believe it.
No, he's right, Cap.
I'd be a fool not to sell.
Well, I'll drift.
I just thought I'd let you to know.
Jim, wait a minute.
You don't tell a dead man he's dead.
You came here for something else, didn't you?
Well, I did had kind of an idea.
- Might not be what you'll like.
- Let's hear it.
Suppose the deadline was put off for a week.
That would give you time to round up your herd.
- Deadline hasn't been put off.
- It can be.
How?
Pindalest would laugh at me if I asked him to.
He wouldn't laugh at me.
No I'm not hiring a gunman to save my herd or anything else.
Jim!
Jim, please wait a minute. He didn't understand what you were saying.
Please don't leave until he does.
He understood all right. Now step back.
I'm gonna follow you 'till you turn back.
You'll have a long ride.
I'm header for Texas.
All right.
We better quit this.
- You'll come back with me and give Dad a chance to apologize?
- No.
But you better go. They'll be looking for you.
I won't go unless you got with me.
Well, I'm gonna turn in.
I'm not leaving.
Well you're not staying here.
- Will you go back with me?
- No.
Then I won't go.
- I'll give you one more chance.
- No
You'll go now, unless you want more of that.
I don't want more of it, Jim.
But I won't go.
You really meant it, didn't you?
That much?
Jim, I know you better than you think.
You've been in hard luck and you've made mistakes.
You hated those mistakes.
But you never admitted them except to yourself.
Like this mess with Riling.
You never liked it.
That's why you walked out on him.
Today you, tried to do something to make up for it.
And Dad threw it back in your face.
He thought you meant to kill Pindalest.
I didn't think so.
I know why you did it.
You thought it would help wipe out the past.
You're a proud man, Jim.
But this is the wrong kind of pride.
If you ride on to Texas you're lost.
Cap's gone on ahead to get the drive started.
Only hope Riling doesn't get wind of what Garry's up to or there'll be the devil to pay.
He knows what kind of man he's dealing with, Dad.
Yeah, I reckon he does.
At any rate, it's our only chance.
So you're going to let Dad risk everything just because Garry sold you a wild lying scheme.
Lie?
You don't believe what Jim told me?
No, Why should I?
He's nothing but a cheap gun man. A killer!
- That's not so. Jim wouldn't...
- Jim?
Yes. Jim!
What's the matter with calling him Jim?
He's no more a gun man than I am.
Amy, what is this?
He's trying to help us and I'll stick up for him to you or anyone else.
Sounds a little stronger than sticking up for him.
Maybe it is.
But a gun man, Amy.
A man that'll go up against hired killers.
How did get get so expert?
You've thought of that?
More than you know.
Nothing made him come back and help us.
Except wanting to get even with Riling.
Not it's not that. He's really decent.
He...
Does he love you?
I don't know.
You're a fool, Amy.
He'll break your heart.
Come in. Come in.
Who is it?
Jim Garry.
Oh oh fine, Sit down.
I'll be out in a minute.
Been riding all day and was just taking a little nap.
- Drink?
- Don't mind if I do.
Well...
How are things?
Fine, Mr. Pindalest.
Just fine.
I brought that news you've been waiting to hear.
Everything went off without a hitch, huh?
Well, maybe one little hitch.
You might say.
What's that?
Lufton wants more money.
How much more?
Three thousand dollars.
Riling said his selling price to you still held.
This was just a loan.
Well, if that's all that holding us up there's nothing to worry about, huh?
Success.
You know. This might cause a little trouble after all.
I don't keep that much cash here at the agency.
Lufton wants cash.
Means I'll have to ride over to Sun Dust with you and draw it out to the bank.
Riling figured you'd likely would.
How's the pass? Clear?
A little snow.
It will probably hold off.
Well, I'll throw some stuff together.
I'll get out of here
Oh I came close to forgettin'.
Riling says call off the Army.
Lufton'll likely run over the deadline roundin' up some beef we stampeded for him.
Riling says he doesn't want to explain to the Army about that.
Good idea.
I'll get a man out to Fort Liggett with a message right away.
Tate, what happened to you?
A fight. Where have you been?
I couldn't get out.
I know who you fought with,
It was Jim Garry.
How do you know?
He's been at the ranch.
Tate, I want to talk to you 'bout something.
That's why I came here tonight.
Well?
What is it?
Garry told us something very interesting.
He said that you and Pindalest had cooked up this fight with Dad to crowd him off the range so he'd sell his cattle to you cheap.
Is that true?
So, Garry told you that, did he?
Is that true?
What else did he tell you?
This sounds good.
That you wanted him to make the offer to Dad.
Did he tell your father that?
Yes.
Tate, you haven't answeredr me. Is this true?
Of course.
You mean you've been making those poor homesteaders that it's their rights you're fighting for?
I wanted money for us.
This is a way to get it, a lot of it.
Money your Dad could spare.
Tate, look at me.
Do you love me? Have you ever loved me?
What do you want me to say? Sure.
Don't lie to me.
You used me to beat Dad.
I betrayed him for you.
Now that's all you ever wanted,
It's all you ever counted on, isn't it?
I wouldn't say that.
Would you go in town with me this minute.
And marry me like you promised?
Not until I get money to support you.
What's funny?
I was thinking of something
I told Amy this morning.
Wasn't that the Lufton's girl?
- What's she doing here?
- None of your business.
What are you doing here?
I thought you said Garry quit
Well?
What's he doing at the Reservation?
- The Reservation?
- Yeah, yeah.
Nels saw him there this morning.
Heading for the agency.
Feel kind of stiff, don't you?
When we get to Sun Dust,
I'll sleep for a week.
We won't be getting to Sun Dust for quite a while.
We'll just stay right here.
What do you mean?
You've been taken in, Pindalest.
Riling never sent me to see you.
I came to take you and hide you out until the deadline.
- And Lufton did not agree to sell?
- No.
Also he's rounding up his cattle right now with no Army to bother him.
But you're a Riling man.
What? I'm with Lufton now.
You can't get away with it, Garry.
Riling's no fool.
He'll be on our trail in twenty four hours.
Let him.
When he does find out what's happened, he'll pull his men off to hunt you
That'll make it all easier for Lufton.
I'd take it easy with that If I were you Pindalest. it will not last out the week.
Don't move.
Maybe I won't nurse this quite as long as you figured.
If you're plannin' on movin out, you're going alone.
I'm giving you a chance to change your mind.
I'm staying here.
Now look, I can lick you and you know it.
Keep this up, you'll end up with a sore head, and that's all.
Suit yourself.
All right.
You win. Untie me.
Come on.
Come on cheer up, Pindalest.
Now we can start looking for a place to make camp.
- Toma! Where are you?
- Over here, Riling.
- Toma, Sing out!
- Riling, Over here!
Send the Indian to Fort Liggett. with the message to bring the Army on.
- Hey, Milo.
- Yeah?
- Get back to the Basin.
See the boys hold Lufton on the Reservation
'till the troops get there.
What about Garry?
We'll take care of him.
Carol.
You've got to stop this.
I know.
I'll make some coffee.
I could have seen Dad and told him.
You must stop thinking about it.
Only, if we knew what was happening to him.
You just got to believe in what
Jim's doing would work.
He has a good chance.
Do you really think so?
Of course I do.
Why don't you lie down for a while.
I'll bring you some coffee.
Why Kris, I thought you'd left the Basin.
I did Miss Amy but...
I guess I've lived around here a little too long.
It got lonesome.
I knew you couldn't leave us for good.
Well I'm back to stay and I come over to ask for your help.
I maybe ain't got no right asking considering who it's for but..
Do you remember that young fella you combed out over at Rocky Ford the other day?
He's been hurt.
Jim Garry?
Came home this morning found him lying on the floor in my shack.
He got a knife stuck in him.
I'll go get dressed.
It's me, Jim.
Lie still.
You gotta get out of here.
No, Jim.
Kris.
Kris, tell here to get out of here.
I'm going to fix this up.
He's asleep.
Good.
So him and your dad are in this together?
Yes.
Young lady, you're going on a ride.
Riling's on his trail. He'll probably end up here sometime today.
That's why Garry wanted, to get you out of here.
We gotta get help.
Do you know where your dad is?
No I don't.
Oh Kris, I don't. We haven't heard from Dad for days.
Well you better find him.
What about Jim?
If they show up I can stand 'em off till your Dad gets here. Don't let that worry you.
Where you gonna look for him?
I don't know. Somewhere south.
- I'll try and pick up the trail of the herd and follow it.
- Good.
What are you doing here?
I might ask you that?
Barden home?
Yes.
Who else is in there?
Nobody.
You're a lovely little liar.
All right fellas, let's take a look.
Hold that the door.
Here take this.
- Riling?
- Yes. And Pindalest and Shotten.
Look here, Kris.
Before this goes any further tell Riling, I'll go with him.
These walls are good and thick. They can't burn us out.
And we got plenty of cartridges.
He won't quit till he's got me and he'll kill you both to do it.
So wel let him shoot you, just to save our necks.
Then tell here she's coming out.
They'll let her through
No. I won't go.
Make her go.
Why do you think she risked her neck to get back in here if it wasn't on account of you?
Why do you think I want to get her out?
Same reason, I reckon.
He's right, Amy.
But it wouldn't work. Not even if you'd have me.
Now will you go?
No.
Look, I've been fiddlefooted and no good all my life.
I'm not askin' any woman to take that.
I knew that when I came here.
That's what I am, Amy. That's me.
Don't you see how useless talk is?
I'm here and I'm staying.
- Jim?
- Yes?
Jim, what are you doing up?
I'm going out there and try and get a crack at them.
No let me talk...
We can probably hold out a few more hours, but...
You ain't going out there just to save our necks.
I'll try and save my own too.
We might as well face it.
They're not gonna give up.
It's not likely anybody'll be along to help us.
Then I'll go.
I got a score to settle with Riling myself.
No, Kris.
It's me Riling's after.
I'd like to finish this my own way.
- You will let him go Miss Amy?
- Yes she is.
Where are they exactly?
They're all scattered out.
Riling's over on the left of 'em trees.
The other two are closer to the corral.
If I just make it to the corner of the corral
I can circle around and get behind them
But they'll see you.
Soon as I get out you open up on 'em.
That'll draw a return fire. Their powder flash will blind 'em for a couple of seconds, thats all I need.
- Ready?
Hold it, Miss Amy. Hold it!
I think he made it.
That last shot came from another direction.
- Do you want to get hit?
- But I got to know.
Hey, Shotten?
Pindalest?
All right Riling, It's just you and me now.
It's a pleasure, Jim.
For me, Tate.
Same old Jim.
When lightning strikes, you're there.
You and me together, Jim.
We coulda licked 'em
But you, you always had a conscience breathing down your neck.
Jim!
Riling's dead.
Shotten too.
And Pindalest?
No I do not think so. He's over there.
- Dad. - Carol told me you were here.
She was afraid there might be trouble.
- Where's riling?
- He's dead.
Well Lufton, don't look like you're gonna get Riling to do much talking now.
I'm going to have you arrested for murder.
Put up a fair fight, John. And
I'll tell that to the sheriff.
Or anybody else that wants to know.
Lufton was telling us about a little deal that you and Riling cooked up to swindle him out of his cattle.
- What about it?
- I had no deal with Riling.
Don't forget I was in on it too.
Well boys, that's the man you've been fighting for.
Get your horse. Me and you are going to have a little talk with the marshal.
I guess we been a pack of fools, Lufton.
Say fellas. I've got a jug I been saving for a special occasion. This looks like it.
What do you say if we...?
Garry I guess I was wrong about quite a few things.
Yeah I was wrong about a few things myself.
We've been plenty stubborn.
That's going to make two stubborn men in the family.
Well I guess Kris was right.
This is a special occasion.
Come on.
Say, buddy, will you stake a fellow...
Hey, mister, will you stake a fellow American to a meal?
- State lottery, señor?
- Beat it. I ain't buying no lottery tickets.
4,000 pesos is the big prize.
Get away from me, you little beggar.
The whole ticket is only 4 pesos.
It's a sure winner.
I ain't got 4 pesos.
Buy a quarter of a ticket for 1 peso silver.
If you don't get away from me,
I'll throw this water right in your face.
Then one tenth of a ticket, señor, for 40...
Señor, buy one twentieth.
One twentieth costs you only 20 centavos.
Look, señor, add the figures up.
You get 13.
What better number could you buy?
It's a sure winner.
- Yeah, how soon's the drawing?
- Only three weeks off.
Give me a twentieth so I don't have to look at your ugly face.
Come again next time.
I always have the winners, all the lucky numbers. Good luck.
Thirteen.
Excuse me.
Cigarette?
Thanks.
- It's hot.
- Yeah.
What a town, Tampico.
You said it, brother.
If I could get a job that'd bring enough to buy passage...
I'd shake its dust off my feet soon enough, you bet.
If I was a native,
I'd get a can of shoe polish... and I'd be in business.
They'd never let a gringo.
You can sit on a bench till you're three-quarters starved.
You can beg from another gringo, or even commit burglary.
You try shining shoes in the street... or peddling lemonade out of a bucket and your hash is settled.
You'll never get another job from an American.
Yeah, and the natives would hound and pester you to death.
- Some town to be broke in.
- What town isn't?
Can you stake a fellow American to a meal?
Hey, mister.
Will you stake a fellow American to a meal?
Such impudence never came my way.
Early this afternoon, I gave you money.
When my shoes were being polished,
I gave you more.
Now you put the bite on me again.
Do me a favor.
Go occasionally to somebody else.
- It's beginning to get tiresome.
- Excuse me. I didn't know it was you.
I never looked at your face, just your hands and the money you gave me.
Beg pardon. I promise
I'll never put the bite on you again.
This is the very last you get from me.
Just to make sure you don't forget your promise, here's another peso.
- Thanks, mister.
- But from now on... you have to make your way through life without my assistance.
Hey, buddy, will you stake a fellow American to a meal?
I won't give you a red cent.
If you want to make some money
I'll give you a job.
- What's the catch?
- There's no catch.
I got a job if you want.
It's hard work, but good pay.
- Did you ever rig a camp?
- Sure.
The ferry's making off, one of my men hasn't shown up.
I don't know what's happened to him.
He's probably drunk in some dive.
- What's the pay?
- $8 a day.
Don't just stand there.
Make up your mind, the ferry doesn't wait.
- I'm your man.
- Come on.
- Hello, there.
- Hello, yourself.
Okay, you guys, get aboard.
Take it your way.
What's the matter with you two?
Can't you take it?
It's 130 in the shade, and there ain't any shade up there on that derrick.
Just figure you're a couple of millionaires in your own private steam bath.
And the sooner we're through... the sooner we'll be back in town drinking cold beer.
We finish within two weeks,
I'm giving you fellas a bonus.
Yeah, it's coming to us working 16, 18 hours a day like we do.
Don't go crying to your mamas.
What do you want?
I'm paying top salaries and a bonus.
What about our pay anyway, and when do we get it?
- I ain't seen a buck out of you yet.
- You'll get your dough, all right... don't worry about that, when we get back to Tampico.
What could you do with money out here anyway, except gamble and lose it?
You'll be paid as we step off the ferry.
The agent was supposed to be here with the dough.
Don't know what could've happened.
But don't worry.
I'll go to the office and pick up the money.
You men stay here.
Any objection to a couple of us coming with you?
Don't you trust me?
You think I'd run out on you?
I don't think you'd do that.
But I ain't got a cent, not even enough to buy me a glass of beer.
Say, you two guys meet me over at the Cantina Madrid.
It's 2:15 now and I'll be over there no later than 3:00.
Pat McCormick.
He comes here from time to time.
I haven't seen him lately.
Pat McCormick?
What about Pat McCormick?
- He's supposed to meet us here.
- Does he owe you any money?
Say, how long you guys been around Tampico, anyway?
What's that got to do with it?
Only foreigners and half-baked Americans fall for McCormick's tricks.
How do you mean?
I mean, he hires dumb guys like you to work for him.
When it comes time to pay off, he takes a powder.
How much we got left of that $10 he gave us, Dobbsie?
- That's not even enough for one bed.
I know a joint that's full of rats, scorpions and cockroaches.
The cots are only 50 centavos a night.
Have another...
...jobs that were a dime a dozen ain't to be had at all.
Streets are full of guys... pushing each other over a meal.
Gold in Mexico? Sure there is.
Not 10 days from here by rail.
The mountain's waiting for the right guy to discover and take her treasure.
The question is: Are you the right guy?
Real bonanzas are few and far between.
They take a lot of finding.
Answer me this, will you?
Why is gold worth some $20 an ounce?
- I don't know. Because it's scarce.
- A thousand men go searching for gold.
After six months one of them's lucky.
One out of the thousand.
His find represents not only his own labor but that of 999 others to boot.
That's 6,000 months, 500 years... scrambling over mountain, going hungry and thirsty.
The gold is worth what it is 'cause of the human labor that went into finding it.
- Never thought of it like that.
- There's no other explanation.
Gold ain't good for nothing except for making jewelry and gold teeth.
Gold's a devilish sort of thing.
You start out to tell yourself you'll be satisfied with $25,000 worth.
So help me Lord and cross my heart.
Fine resolution.
After months of sweating yourself dizzy, few provisions, finding nothing... you finally come down to $15,000, then $10,000.
Finally you say,
"Lord, let me just find $5,000 worth...
"and I'll never ask for anything more the rest of my life."
$5,000 is a lot of money.
In this joint it seems like a lot.
But if you made a real strike, you couldn't be dragged away.
Even the threat of death wouldn't keep you from adding $10,000 more.
$10,000, you'd want $25,000.
$25,000, you'd want $50,000.
$50,000, $100,000. Like roulette.
One more turn, you know.
Always one more.
It wouldn't be that way with me.
I swear, it wouldn't.
I'd take only what I set out to get.
Even if there was still $500,000 worth... lying around, waiting to be picked up.
I've dug in Alaska and Canada and Colorado.
I was in the British Honduras,
I made my fare back home... and almost enough over to cure me of the fever I'd caught.
Dug in California and Australia.
All over the world practically.
Yeah. I know what gold does to men's souls.
You talk as though you struck it rich sometime or other, pop.
How about it?
Then what are you doing in here, a down-and-outer?
That's gold. That's what it makes us.
Never knew a prospector yet that died rich.
Make one fortune, he's sure to blow it trying to find another.
I'm no exception to the rule.
Sure I'm a gnawed old bone now but don't you guys think the spirit's gone.
I'm set to shoulder a pickaxe if anybody's willing to share expenses.
I'd rather go by myself.
It's best to go alone.
But you got to have a stomach for loneliness. Some guys go nutty with it.
But going with a partner is dangerous.
Murder is always lurking about.
Partners accusing each other of all sorts of crimes.
As long as there's no find, the noble brotherhood will last.
But when the piles of gold begin to grow, that's when the trouble starts.
I wouldn't mind a little of that kind of trouble.
I think I'll go to sleep... and dream about piles of gold... getting bigger and bigger.
Do you believe what the old man... who was doing all the talking at the Oso Negro... said the other night... about gold changing a man's soul so that he ain't the same kind of a guy... that he was before finding it?
Guess that all depends on the man.
That's exactly what I say.
Gold don't carry any curse with it.
It all depends on whether or not the guy who finds it is the right guy.
The way I see it... gold can be as much of a blessing as a curse.
Look who's coming out of the Hotel Bristol.
Is that Pat McCormick or am I seeing things?
It's him.
- Let's get him.
- Let's get him hard.
Why don't you and me go and buy me something?
I could use a new pair of shoes.
Hello, fellows, how are you?
Glad to see you.
- Mr. Dobbs and Mr. Curtin, Señorita...
- López.
López. I want you guys to come and have a drink with me.
I've got business to attend to with these men.
You go back up the hotel and wait.
I won't be long.
Okay.
Fellas, let's have that drink.
Where have you been?
I've been looking all over for you.
Three shots of rye.
Make mine brandy, Three Star.
- Two brandies.
- Rye is good enough for me.
I suppose you're wondering about that money that's coming to you.
The fact is I haven't been paid off on that contract myself.
If I had the money, you'd get it first thing.
I'll put you both on my next contract.
It will come through by Monday and we can set out Friday.
Here's mud in your eye.
We want what's coming to us.
We want it right here and now.
- But didn't I just tell you...
- You better come across.
I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll give you 25º% .
I guess I can make it 30º% .
And the balance, say, the middle of next week?
Nothing doing. Right here and now.
Every cent or you won't walk out of here.
You'll be carried out.
Let's don't stop being friends.
How about another drink?
Two more brandies.
Put the bottle on the bar.
If you want to get us liquored up...
No, I'm just inviting you to have a friendly drink with me.
- I'm licked, boys.
- Give us our money.
Yeah, give us our money.
I can't see.
- That's it, ain't it, Curt?
- Yeah, that's it.
Let's beat it before the law arrives.
Here's for the drinks and the use of the cantina.
- You know something, Curt?
- What?
We ain't very smart, hanging around Tampico waiting for a job.
Money's getting shorter every day... and soon we'll be right back where we were, on the bum again... pushing guys for dimes, sleeping around in freight cars.
That's right. Got any ideas?
That old man in the Oso Negro started me to thinking.
What about?
Why not try gold-digging for a change?
It ain't any riskier than waiting around here for a break... and this is the country where the nuggets of gold are crying for you... to take them out of the ground, make them shinin' coins... on the fingers and necks of swell dames.
One thing, living in the open is cheaper than it is here in Tampico.
Our money'd last longer.
The longer it lasts, the greater our chance of digging something up would be.
We'd have to have equipment, all right.
Picks and spades, pans, burros.
Wonder how much it would all cost.
- That old man would know.
- Yeah, he could give us some pointers.
He's too old to take along.
We'd have to pack him on our backs.
You can't tell about some of those old guys.
It's surprising sometimes how tough they are.
I don't know what gold looks like in the ground.
I've only seen it in jewelry store windows and people's mouths.
You know anything about prospecting?
Not much when you come right down to it.
We might have real use for an experienced guy like that old-timer.
Let's go hunt him up right away.
Will I go? What a question.
Of course I'll go.
Any time, any day,
I was waiting for somebody to ask me.
Out for gold? I'm always at your service.
I got $300 ready cash in the bank.
$200 of it all set to invest.
Last money I got.
When it's gone, I'm finished.
If you don't take a risk, you can't make a gain.
How much dough you guys got to put in?
I've got $150 and Curtin's got the same.
$500 ain't hardly enough to buy tools, weapons and essential provisions.
What do we need weapons for?
Meat's one thing and bandits another.
Bandit country's where we'd be going.
We need $600 between us.
- That much?
- Can't you dig up any more?
Not a red cent.
Give me my money, señor!
10º% I get for selling the winning ticket.
Get away from me, will you?
Please, señor.
Whoever draws the lucky number... gives a present to the seller...
I don't want any lottery ticket!
If you don't, you have bad luck the rest of your life.
What? Wait a minute.
What did you first say?
Why, he's trying to tell you he sold you the winning ticket.
Hey, wait a minute.
This what you mean?
- You say it's the winner?
- 200 peso prize.
Where?
- That's my number.
- Sure enough.
Just look at that fat, rich, printed number.
That's the kind of sugar poppa likes.
200 pesos.
Welcome, sweet little smackeroos.
Here, son, here's a present for you with my blessing.
Would you like to shake the hand that bought that ticket?
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations, yourself.
You stand to profit out of this the same as I do.
How do you make that out?
Didn't he just say we needed $600?
That's what we've got now, ain't it?
- Yeah, but...
- But what?
- Why are you putting up for me?
- This is an all-or-nothing proposition.
If we make a find, we'll be lighting our cigars with $100 bills.
If not, the difference between what you and I put up... ain't enough to keep me from being where I was this afternoon:
Polishing a bench with the seat of my pants.
Put her there, part.
We'll buy our burros at Perla and head northwest away from the railroad.
It's no use looking near a railroad... or any kind of a road at all... because construction engineers examine every bit of ground around the road... while they're building them.
We got to go where there's no trails... where no surveyor or anyone who knows anything of prospecting has been before.
The best place to go to is... where any salaried person wouldn't go, because he wouldn't want to risk his hide.
I got three of them!
How many did you get?
- A couple.
- I'm one up. I bet I got more than you did.
I got three. Nice shooting?
That bullet hole's two inches from my head. That was close.
The bullets were sure flying thick and fast in here.
It sounded like a swarm of bees here.
That bandit with the gold hat,
I had my sights on him, nice as you please.
The train gave a jolt and I missed.
Wish I'd got him.
Big boulder on the track so train stop.
Bandits got big surprise because soldiers on the train waiting for them.
Not many passengers get killed.
Here's where we're bound for.
Don't show whether there's mountain, swamp or desert.
That shows the makers of the map don't know.
Once on the ground, we open our eyes and look around.
Blow our noses, too.
Believe it or not, I knew a fellow... who could smell gold like a jackass can smell water.
What's all that about?
We're going into country very wild and dangerous.
Have to cut through jungles... and climb mountains so high they rise above the clouds.
Tigers so strong they can climb trees with burros in their mouths. Good.
Glad to hear such tall tales 'cause it means few outsiders have set foot there.
Well, let's get going.
If there was gold in them mountains, how long would it have been there?
Millions and millions of years, wouldn't it?
What's our hurry?
A couple of days more or less ain't going to make any difference.
Remember what you said back in Tampico... about having to pack that old man on our backs?
That was when I took him for an ordinary human being... not part goat.
Look at him climb, will you?
What gets me is how he can go all day in the sun without any water.
Maybe he's part camel, too.
If I'd known what prospecting meant...
I'd have stayed in Tampico and waited for another job to turn up.
- What's the matter?
- Look.
Look at it glitter. It's yellow, too, like...
Gold.
Come back, we've found something!
Look, Curt, there's a vein of it, here, in this rock.
Look here. Look, it's all around.
What else could it be?
Only gold shines and glitters like that.
We've struck it, Curt.
Look, from the looks of things... we've struck it rich.
Look, it's all over here.
- We found a what do you call it...
- Mother lode.
- That's right.
- Howard!
Come on. Look.
Here, look at this rock.
It's full of gold. Veins of it.
This stuff wouldn't pay your dinner for a carload.
It ain't gold?
Pyrite. Fool's gold.
Not that there ain't plenty of the real stuff here.
We've walked over it four or five times.
A place yesterday looked like rich diggings, but the water... for washing the sand was 11 miles away.
The other places, there wasn't much gold to pay us a good day's wages.
Next time you strike it rich, holler for me... before you start splashing water around.
Water's precious.
Sometimes it can be more precious than gold.
Burro.
- What's up?
- Norther, looks like.
A "norther"? What's a "norther"?
Big winds from the north this time of year... when they blow hard, this desert country stands right up on its hind legs!
There's only a few more miles of this heavy stuff.
Pretty soon we'll be out of this valley.
You fellows, how about some beans?
You want some beans?
Going through some mighty rough country tomorrow. You better have some beans.
You know what I'm thinking?
I'm thinking we ought to give up... leave the whole outfit... everything behind.
Go back to civilization.
What's that you say? Go back?
Tell my old grandmother!
I got two elegant bedfellows who kick at the first drop of rain... and hide in the closet when thunder rumbles.
What great prospectors.
Two shoe clerks reading about prospecting for gold... in the Land of the Midnight Sun, south of the border or west of the Rockies.
Shut your trap or I'll smash your head flat!
Go ahead, throw it. If you did, you'd never leave this place alive.
Without me, you two would die here more miserable than rats.
Leave him alone.
Can't you see the old man's nuts?
Nuts, am I? Let me tell you something, my fine bedfellows.
There's nothing to compare you with.
You're dumber than the dumbest jackass.
Look at each other.
Did you ever see anything like yourself for being dumb specimens?
You're so dumb... you don't even see the riches you're treading on with your own feet.
Don't expect to find nuggets of molten gold.
It's not that rich.
Here ain't the place to dig.
It comes from someplace further up.
Up there.
Up there's where we've got to go.
- Is that it?
- That's it, all right.
Gold, I mean.
Sure don't look like I thought it would.
- Not much different from sand.
- Yeah. It's just like plain sand.
It don't glitter. I thought it would.
It will when it's refined by some other guy.
All we got to do is mine it and get it back there.
Gold ain't like stones in a riverbed.
It don't cry out to be picked up.
You got to know how to recognize it.
The finding ain't all. Not by a long shot.
Got to know how to tickle her so she'll come out laughing.
Yeah, it's mighty rich. It'll pay good.
- How good?
- About 20 ounces to the ton.
- That's $20 an ounce.
- How many tons can we handle a week?
Depends on how hard we work.
We better pitch our camp down the mountainside.
Why, when the digging's here?
Anyone comes by, we say we're hunters, and get away with it maybe.
- Wouldn't it be easier to file a claim?
- Easier but not so profitable.
An emissary from a big mining company would be here soon... with a paper in his hand showing we had no right to be here.
How does it feel to be men of property?
The tanks'll leak some at first... until the boards begin to swell and close the seams.
I sure had some cockeyed ideas about prospecting for gold.
It was all in the finding, I thought.
I thought you just had to find it, pick it up, put it in sacks... and carry them off to the nearest bank.
You're learning. Pretty soon
I won't be able to tell you a thing.
- Tank full yet?
- Right to the top.
Open the sluice gate.
How much do you figure it to be now?
About $5,000 worth, I reckon.
When are we going to start dividing it up?
Anytime you say.
Why divide it at all? I don't see any point.
We're all going back together when the time comes.
Why not wait till we get paid and then divide the money?
Either way suits me. You fellows decide.
I'm for dividing it up as we go along.
Make each guy responsible for his own goods.
I'd just as soon have it that way.
I don't like the responsibility of guarding your treasure.
Who asked you to?
That's right. You never asked me.
Only, I thought I was the most trustworthy of the three.
You?
How come?
I said the most trustworthy. As far as being the most honest, no one can say.
I don't get you.
Suppose you're charged of taking care of the goods.
One day I'm deep in the brush and Curtin's on his way to get provisions.
That'd be your chance to pack up and leave us in the cold.
Only a guy that's a thief at heart would think me likely to do a thing like that.
Right now, it wouldn't be worth your while... but when the pile's grown to 300 ounces, think of such things you will.
How's about yourself?
I'm not quick on my feet any longer.
You're a lot tougher than when we started out.
By the time the pile's grown to be really tempting...
I won't be able to run half as fast as you.
You'd catch me and string me up in no time.
That's why I think
I'm the most trustworthy.
Looking at it that way,
I guess you're right.
Maybe it'd be a good idea... to cut the proceeds up three ways every night.
It'll relieve you of a responsibility you don't like.
Swell by me.
After we got a couple of hundred ounces... it'll be a nuisance carrying bags around our necks.
Each of us will have to hide his share from the others.
And after that, he'll have to be forever on watch that his hiding place's not found.
What a dirty, filthy mind you've got.
Not dirty, baby.
Only I know what kind of ideas... even supposedly decent people get when gold's at stake.
All right.
Here she goes three ways.
Dobbs!
Howard, come quick!
He's coming around.
Lay still a minute till you get your senses back.
What happened?
Part of the mine caved in on you.
Got a knock on the head.
No bones broken?
I don't think so.
- Who pulled me out?
- Curtin did.
I owe my life to you, partner.
Forget it.
What'll you do with your hard-earned money... when we get back and cash in?
I'm getting along in years.
I can still hold up my end... when it comes to a hard day's work, but I'm not the man I was once.
Next year, next month, next week, by thunder, won't be the man I'm today.
I think I'll settle down in a quiet place... get a little business, hardware, grocery store... spend the better part of my time reading comics and adventure stories.
One thing's for sure.
I won't go prospecting again... wasting time and money trying to find another gold mine.
How about yourself?
What plans have you, if any?
I figure on buying some land and growing fruit. Peaches, maybe.
How did you come to settle on peaches?
One summer, when I was a kid...
I worked as a picker in a peach harvest in the San Joaquin Valley.
Boy, it sure was something.
Hundreds of people, old and young.
Whole families working together.
At night, after a day's work... we used to build big bonfires and sit around and sing to guitar music.
Till morning sometimes.
We'd go to sleep, wake up and sing, and go to sleep again.
Everybody had a wonderful time.
Ever since then I've had a hankering to be a fruit grower.
It must be grand watching your own trees put on leaves... come into blossom and bear.
Watching the fruit get big and ripe on the boughs, ready for picking.
What's all that about?
We're telling each other what we aim to do when we get back.
Now me, I got it all figured out what I'm gonna do.
Tell us about it, Dobbsie.
First off, I'm going to a Turkish bath to sweat and soak... till I get all the grime and dirt out of my system.
Then I'm going to a haberdasher and gonna get myself a brand-new set of duds.
Dozen of everything.
Then I'm going to a swell cafe... order everything on the bill o' fare and if it ain't just right... or maybe even if it is,
I'm gonna bawl the waiter out... and make him take the whole thing back.
What's next on the program?
Well, what would be?
If I were you, I wouldn't talk or think about women.
It ain't good for your health.
Yeah, maybe you're right, seeing how the prospects are far off.
You know what?
We ought to put a limit on our take, agree between us... when we get so much we pull up stakes and beat it.
- What do you think the limit ought to be?
- Say $25,000 worth apiece.
$25,000, small potatoes.
How much do you say?
$50,000 anyway,
$75,000 would be more like it.
That'd take a year if the vein held out, which wouldn't be likely.
What's a year more or less when that kind of money is to be had?
$25,000 is plenty as far as I'm concerned.
Enough to last me the rest of my lifetime.
Well, sure, you're old, I'm young.
I need dough and plenty of it.
$25,000 in one piece... is more than I ever expected to get my hands on.
Small potatoes.
There's no use making hogs of ourselves.
Hog, am I?
Maybe you don't know, but I'd be within my rights... if I demanded half again as much as you get.
How come?
There's no denying I put up the lion's share of the cash.
So you did, Dobbsie, and I always meant to pay you back.
In any civilized place the biggest investor gets the biggest return, don't he?
That's one thing in favor of the wilds.
Not that I intended to demand it, but I'd be within my rights if I did.
Next time you call me a hog just remember... what I could've done if I'd wanted to.
I think it'd be wise not to put things strictly on a money basis.
Here you are, Dobbs.
What I owe you with interest.
I just don't like being called a hog, that's all.
Don't scare me like that.
I might have let you have it.
Out for a midnight stroll?
Tiger around,
I went to check on the burros.
- So?
- What's the matter?
- I think I'll see if the burros are all right.
- Go ahead. Help yourself.
- What's up?
- Nothing's up.
Where is Dobbs?
Poking around in the dark out there.
He's sure taking a long time out there.
I think I'll go have a look-see.
Where's Curtin?
He's out there somewhere.
Said he was gonna have a look-see.
It's my turn again but I won't take it... if you stop worrying about your goods and go to bed.
We got work to do tomorrow.
Can't catch me sleeping.
Don't you ever believe that.
I'm not that dumb.
The day you try to put anything over on me... it'll be a costly one for both of you.
Any more lip out of you and I'll up and let you have it.
If you know what's good for you, you won't monkey around with Fred C. Dobbs.
You ought to see Dobbs.
He's talking to himself a mile a minute.
Something's eating him all right,
I don't know what.
He's just spoiling for trouble.
"We're running short of provisions,
Dobbsie.
"How about you going to the village?"
Who does Howard think he is, ordering me around?
What's that, Dobbs?
- Nothing.
- Better look out.
It's a bad sign when a guy talks to himself.
Yeah? Who else am I gonna talk to?
Certainly not you or Curtin.
- Fine partners you two are.
- Got something up your nose?
Blow it out, it'll do you good.
Don't think you two are putting anything over on me.
- Take it easy.
- I know what your game is.
You know more than I do.
Why am I elected to go to the village instead of you or Curtin?
Don't think I don't see through that.
You two are together against me.
The two days I'd be gone... would give you lots of time to discover where my goods are.
If you fear along those lines... why don't you take your goods with you?
And run the risk of having them taken from me by bandits?
If you run into them, you'd be out of luck anyway.
They'd kill you for the shoes on your feet.
So that's it. Everything's clear now.
You're hoping bandits will get me.
That would save you a lot of trouble, wouldn't it?
And your consciences wouldn't bother you none neither.
All right, Dobbs, forget about it.
Just like I thought.
- What's the idea?
- Put your hands up.
I've a good mind to haul off and pump you up, chest and belly alike.
Would you mind telling me what this is about?
It won't get you anywhere playing dumb.
Well, I'll be.
- So that's where your goods are hidden?
- Hey, what's the trouble here?
Seems like I accidentally stumbled on Dobbsie's treasure.
Accidentally? Why were you trying to pry up that rock?
I saw a gila monster crawl under it.
Brother, I got to hand it to you.
You can certainly pick up a good story when you need one.
Okay, I'm a liar.
There isn't a gila monster under there.
Let's see you stick your hand in and get your goods out.
- Go ahead.
- Sure I will.
But you try any bad moves...
Don't worry. I'll stay right where I am.
I want to see this.
Reach in and get your goods.
If you don't, we'll think you're yellow, won't we, Howard?
They never let go, do they, Howard, once they grab onto you?
You can cut them in two and the head will still hang on till sundown, I hear.
By that time the victim doesn't usually care 'cause he's dead.
- Isn't that right, Howard?
- I reckon.
Why don't you stick your hand in and get your treasure?
Couldn't be because you're scared... after the way you've been shooting your mouth off?
Show us you ain't yellow.
I'd hate to think my partner had a yellow streak up his back.
I'll kill you, you dirty, thieving...
Okay, Howard, I got him covered.
Another bad move out of you and I'll blow you to kingdom come.
Howard, turn that rock over, will you?
The federales are very efficient.
Yeah. Bandidos, eh?
Yeah, seems between them they had a diamond ring... pearl earrings, a lot of money and a railway ticket... with the date of the Aguascalientes train robbery on it.
They've been here several days, drinking, shooting...
The villagers are afraid to go out of their huts.
Where are they taking them now?
To the cemetery.
The federales don't operate in our American way.
They're not fingerprint experts, but they can follow any trail.
Against them, no hideout is any use.
They know all the tricks of the bandits.
You can bet your sweet soul they'll trace down... every last one of that group that attacked the train.
It'll take time, months maybe, but they'll do it.
Not many Americans get around this way.
You're the first
I've bumped into in a long time.
That so?
- Mighty rugged country hereabouts.
- Yeah.
My name's Cody.
I'm from Texas.
- What's your game?
- I'm a hunter.
- Professional?
- Yeah.
What all do you hunt?
Tiger cats, anything of commercial value.
How long did you say you'd been in these mountains?
A few months.
Ever seen anything that looked like pay dirt?
I've a hunch there's loads of the real goods up in those mountains.
No, I know the whole landscape around here.
If there'd been gold, you can bet I'd have seen it.
There's nothing doing here for gold.
I can look at a hill five miles away... and tell you if it carries an ounce or a shipload.
If you haven't found anything...
I'll come with you, put your nose in it.
There's indications in the valley, lots of indications.
By tracing the rocks,
I find they come from a ridge... washed down by the tropical rains.
- You don't say so.
- Yes, I say so.
So much for those bandits.
You gotta hand it to the Mexicans when it comes to swift justice.
Once the federales get their mitts on a criminal... they know what to do.
They hand him a shovel, tell him to dig.
When he's dug deep enough... they tell him to put the shovel down, smoke a cigarette and say his prayers.
In another five minutes he's being covered over with the earth he dug out.
Yeah, you gotta hand it to them all right.
I meant what I said about going along with you. Those are my burros.
I'm ready to start if you'll let me go with you to your camp.
Thanks anyway, but I prefer going it by myself.
Good luck.
I went way around, stayed on hard ground which wouldn't show the tracks.
Every time I hit a high point and looked
I'd see he was still following me.
I guess it's only a matter of time till he shows up here.
- I move we tell him straight off to beat it.
- Now, no, that'd be foolish.
He'd sit for an hour playing the innocent and then report us to the officials.
Once they come, we can't stay or take our goods with us if we left.
There's nothing else to do but kill him the minute he appears.
No crime to visit these mountains.
He may be a guy that likes to wander.
You can't shoot him for that.
If you were to shoot him it might come out.
We don't have to shoot him necessarily.
We can push him off a rock and claim it was an accident.
Just who's gonna do the pushing, you?
We'll toss for it.
You're sure he was trailing you, are you?
- Absolutely.
- How come?
Because there he is.
Come over by the fire.
I know quite well, you fellas, I'm not wanted here.
Even after what you told me...
I couldn't resist the desire to sit and jaw with an American.
Why don't you go where Americans want to talk to you?
Durango isn't too far off.
They got one of them American clubs there.
I'm not after that.
I've got other things on my mind, more important.
So do we. Don't make any mistakes.
Our biggest worry is your presence here.
We got no use for you.
We don't even want you for a cook or a dishwasher.
No vacancies, understand?
In case I don't make myself clear, you'll be doing yourself a favor... packing up and getting out tomorrow morning.
Go back where you came from.
Take our blessings with you.
Thanks.
Go ahead. Help yourself. We're no misers.
We don't let guys starve to death.
Tonight, you're our guest.
But tomorrow morning...
Iook out, no trespassing around here, you know?
"Beware of the dogs." Get it?
I got myself five foxes and a lion while you were away at the village.
- How are the hides?
- Pretty good.
- Where'd you hit them?
- Right through their eyes.
Excuse me for butting in, but there's no game here worth going after.
It wouldn't take a week for a hunter... to clean up all around for five miles in each direction.
Yes, there's no good hunting here.
That's why we made up our mind to leave... so that we could look for something better.
Yes, stranger, you're dead right.
Awful poor ground.
It took us some time to find it out.
Poor ground, you say?
Depends on what you're looking for.
For game, yes.
Mighty good ground for something else.
What might that be?
Gold.
That's a good one.
I told you in the village, there's no gold around here.
If there was one single ounce of it,
I'd have seen it, believe me.
If you haven't found any gold here, you're not as smart as you appear to be.
Well, maybe, you're right.
Who knows?
We never thought about gold.
Gives me an idea.
Guess I'll sleep on it.
I'll hit the hay.
Yeah. Me, too.
See you in the morning, mister.
I can't figure this bird out.
Is he wise to us or not?
Whether he is or not, he looks fairly harmless to me.
- Looks can be mighty deceiving.
- No denying that.
I'm keeping my boots on this night.
Might take it in his head to murder us in our sleep.
- Anything can happen. I'll tell you what.
- Well, then?
You guys go to sleep and I'll be watchdog for a few hours.
Then you both can take your turns.
- Okay. Got your gun handy?
- Yeah. Right here.
Good morning, friend.
Where'd you get the water to make coffee?
- I took it out of the olla.
- You did, did you?
We didn't carry that water here for you to make coffee.
- I didn't know water was so hard to get.
- You know it now.
I'll fill it up for you.
What's up?
I caught this guy stealing our water.
The next time I'll let it out of you through little round holes.
I thought I was among civilized men who wouldn't begrudge me fresh water.
Who's not civilized?
I could easily do the same for you.
It's not settled yet who'd come out on top.
This time I took it.
Thanks for your kind attention.
If I was you, stranger,
I'd pack up and go while the going's good.
I mean to stay right here.
The brush and the mountains are free, aren't they?
Sure. That's right, whoever's first on the spot.
That holds for hunters, but not for gold miners.
Unless they have happened to have registered their claim.
Who says we have a claim to register?
Whatever you say or don't say, tomorrow I start to dig for gold here.
I know you guys can bump me off any minute... but that's a risk worth running considering the stakes.
Let's lay all our cards on the table.
As I see it, you guys have to do one of three things:
Kill me, run me off or take me in with you as a partner.
Let's consider the first.
Another guy may come along tomorrow.
Maybe a dozen other guys.
If you start killing them... how far are you prepared to go?
Ask yourselves that.
Also, don't forget, the one actually to do the bumping off... would forever be in the power of the other two.
The only safe way would be for all of you to drag out your cannons... and bang away at the same instant like a firing squad.
We wouldn't stop at anything to protect our interests.
I claim killing me isn't it.
But, of course, that's for you to decide.
As for choice number two... you run me off,
I might very well inform on you.
We'd get you if you did that.
We'd get you if we had to go all the way to China.
25º% of the value of your find is the reward I'd get.
And that would be mighty tempting.
It's a strong argument in favor of number one.
I don't deny it.
But let's see what number three has to offer.
If you take me in as a partner, you don't stand to lose anything.
I'll not ask a share in what you've made so far, only in the profits to come.
What do you say?
Mind, stranger, letting us talk this over among ourselves?
Not at all. Go ahead.
I have to look after my burros anyway.
- What do you think?
- Sending him away is out of the question.
Either we bump him off or make him a partner.
F.C. Dobbs ain't a guy that likes being taken advantage of.
Do the mug in, I say.
He told us how, didn't he?
All of us hold out our cannons and let him have it.
What do we gain by bumping him off?
If he was asking to share in what we made it'd be different.
I don't mind being taken advantage of... if it isn't money out of my pocket.
And whoever else comes along... they're to be invited in, too.
Come one, come all?
You got a point there.
No question about that.
But killing...
- What's the matter, ain't you up to it?
- Sure, I'm up to it.
Let the majority decide.
What's your vote, partner?
For or against?
For.
Let's make it short and sweet for him.
So it's number one, is it?
Better take a look down that hill first.
I can't make out what they are.
They must be soldiers.
So that's your stinking game, is it?
Informing. I knew you were an informer.
I knew it all the time.
You're wrong, brother.
This means all our funerals.
What's that?
If it's what I think it is, may the Lord be with us.
They're not soldiers, they're bandits.
After guns and ammunition, not gold.
Some villager must have told them about the American hunter.
They don't look like soldiers to me, either.
They are bandits.
We better start thinking of a way to defend ourselves.
We can hide in the rocks but we'll lose the burros and the whole outfit.
The best thing is to fight.
You have good eyes.
Stay here on this lookout... for the time being and watch their movements.
You herd all the burros in that thicket there.
Dobbs, we'll wrap up all our belongings and dump them in the trench.
They're turning onto the trail.
- How many of them are there?
- About a dozen.
They'll be an hour getting here so we better eat something.
Come on down, friend.
Look, Howard.
The one in the gold hat, remember?
Yeah, the man in the train robbery.
They think whoever was here is gone.
Some want to go back down the mountains, others want to stay... and use this site as headquarters to raid the villages.
How about pouring it into them?
- Bumping off as many as we can, real fast?
- No, let's hold our horses.
We are federales.
You know, the mounted police.
If you are the police, where are your badges?
Badges? We ain't got no badges.
We don't need no badges.
I don't have to show you any stinking badges.
Better not come any closer.
We didn't try to do you any harm.
Why don't you try to be a little more polite?
Give us your gun and we'll leave you in peace.
I need my gun myself.
Throw that old iron over here.
We'll pick it up and go on our way.
You go anyway without my gun, and go quick.
All right.
Look here, amigo, you got the wrong idea.
We don't want to get your gun for nothing. We want to buy it.
Look, I have a gold watch with a gold chain... made in your own country.
The watch and the chain, they're worth at least 200 pesos.
I'll change it for your gun.
You better take it.
That's a good business for you.
You keep your watch, I'll keep my gun.
Oh, you'll keep it? You will keep it?
We won't get it?
I'll show you.
Anybody get hurt?
Looks like we won that round.
- That guy with the gold hat, ain't he...
- We spotted him, too. The train robber.
- Maybe they got enough?
- I doubt it.
Since they know there's four guns, they'll be more determined than ever.
- What do you suppose they'll pull next?
- No telling. All we can do is sit tight.
Cody, are you all right?
He's dead.
Got it right through the neck.
One less gun.
Chopping wood for camp, that's funny.
If they're up to what I think they are, it ain't funny.
- What's that?
- They're building moving barricades.
An old Indian trick.
They crawl and push the barricades.
You can't see where to shoot.
I'd be willing to trade my share of the mine right now for a few hand grenades.
You'd better get to your posts.
They're beating it.
- What do you make of that?
- Your guess is as good as mine.
Wait a minute, this may be some trick to lure us out.
I don't think so. They ain't good enough actors for this kind of a trick.
Hey, partner. Up here.
Here's a sight if there ever was one.
Federales. Look at them.
I could kiss every one of them.
They must've gotten it from the villagers there were bandits headed here.
Why don't they wait here, make a fight of it?
They know all the tricks, that's why.
With us behind and the federales facing them, they wouldn't have a chance.
Go get them, sic 'em time.
Chew them up and don't spit them out.
Swallow them.
Am I happy.
Tell you the truth,
I was already eating dirt.
I wonder who he is.
And if he's got any folks.
Supposing he has?
Let's take a look at his belongings.
A few hundred pesos.
Name's James Cody. Dallas, Texas.
A letter from Dallas, too.
It must be his home.
Reckon she's his girl.
Not bad.
"Dear Jim: Your letter just arrived.
"It was such a relief to get word after so many months of...
"silence.
"I realize, of course, that...
"there aren't any mailboxes that you can drop a letter in...
"out there in the wild."
You better read it.
"But that doesn't keep me from worrying about you.
"Little Jimmy is fine, but he misses his daddy almost as much as I do.
"He keeps asking,
'When's Daddy coming home? '
"You say if you do not make a real find this time...
"you'll never go again.
"I cannot begin to tell you how my heart rejoices...
"at those words, if you really mean them.
"Now I feel free to tell you...
"I've never thought any material treasure...
"no matter how great, is worth the pain of these long separations.
"The country is especially lovely this year.
"It's been a perfect spring.
Warm rains and hardly any frost.
"The fruit trees are all in bloom.
"The upper orchard looks aflame...
"and the lower, like after a snowstorm.
"Everybody looks forward to big crops.
"I do hope you are back for the harvest.
"Of course, I'm hoping that you will at last strike it rich.
"It is high time for luck...
"to start smiling upon you.
"But just in case she doesn't...
"remember we've already found life's real treasure.
"Forever yours, Helen."
I guess we better dig a hole for him.
Yeah, not so good.
Not so good as yesterday.
Want my opinion?
It'll be a lot less from now on.
We've taken all the gold this mountain has.
How much do you figure we got to date?
Not as much as we were aiming to collect.
Not $40,000.
I'm willing to lower my hindsight.
We've got upwards of $35,000 apiece.
I tell you, we ought to be plenty thankful.
Let's call it quits and pack up and leave.
The sooner the better as far as I'm concerned.
I don't want to keep that dame waiting.
It'll take a week to break the mine, put the mountain back in shape.
Do what to the mountain?
Make her look like she was before we came.
I don't get it.
We wounded this place.
It's our duty to close her wounds.
The least we can do to show our gratitude for all the wealth she's given us.
If you guys don't want to help me,
I'll do it alone.
You talk about that mountain like it was a real woman.
She's been a lot better to me than any woman I ever knew.
Keep your shirt on, old-timer.
Sure, I'll help you.
I reckon that's about everything.
Each man's burros with his goods will be his own responsibility.
Come on.
Goodbye, mountain, and thanks.
Yeah, thanks, mountain.
I've been thinking about her.
Cody's widow, I mean, and the kid.
You know what?
We ought to give them a fourth just as if he'd been our partner from the start.
What? A fourth of all our goods?
- That's right.
- Are you crazy?
If not for him, we wouldn't have walked away from that mountain.
Ask Howard.
The buzzard would have gotten fat on us all right.
Yeah, it might just as well have been one of us.
But it wasn't.
It's our good luck and his bad.
Whatever you guys do,
I'm going to give a fourth.
I got more than I need, anyhow.
Half what I got is enough to last me out.
Fourth? Sure.
You two guys must have been born in a revival meeting.
We got company.
Steady, boys.
Coffee.
Give him some tobacco.
We give them our tobacco, they give us theirs, I don't get it.
Why not everybody smoke his own?
Take some and thank them.
They're after something.
Takes them a while to come to the point.
To say what you want right off the bat isn't considered polite among Indians.
They got nothing but time?
His boy fell in the water, they fished him out.
- He ain't dead, but he just won't come to.
- Tough.
I'll go have a look at the boy.
I'll be back in a little while.
Before morning, probably.
Look after my goods while I am gone.
Tequila.
Artificial respiration did it and a few Boy Scout tricks.
I think it was more shock than drowning.
He hadn't swallowed much water.
Maybe he was stunned while diving.
How did these Indians know we were in this neck of the woods anyhow?
When you're near their villages, don't ask me how, they just know.
What's up?
He's insisting we return to his village and be his guests.
Tell him to forget it.
Tell him he don't owe us a thing.
If he doesn't pay off his debt all the saints will be angry.
This is no laughing matter.
I'm afraid he's determined to take us with him, even if it means force.
I'll handle this.
Wait a minute. You can't fight your way out of this. Put your guns away.
Have every Indian in the mountain on our trail. We'd be scalped in half an hour.
What'd he say then?
It didn't make any difference about you guys but I have to come.
- It's like that, he just wants you.
- Looks like it.
Why don't you go with them?
Stay a few days and we'll meet you in Durango. We'll wait there.
- What about my goods?
- Why don't you take them with you.
If they found out they might forget he was their honored guest and bump him off.
What'll I do? Dump them on the ground?
We'll take them with us if you want us to and wait for you in Durango.
I reckon that's about the only solution.
I bet you'll remember this the next time you try to do a good deed.
Maybe after I've stayed with them they'll give me a horse.
Then I'll be a day or two behind you.
That'll be swell. Good luck, Howard.
Yeah, all the luck in the world.
We'll be lonesome without you. But my Sunday school teacher used to say:
"You got to learn to swallow disappointments in this sad life."
Hurry up and join us.
Look out for those Indian dames.
They tell me they're smart.
One of them squaws might marry you.
Maybe I'll do just that. Pick out a good-looking squaw and marry her.
They're easy to dress, feed and entertain.
They don't nag at you, either.
So long, partners.
See you in Durango.
Ain't it always his burros that won't march in line... stray off the trail and smash their packs against the trees and rocks?
I wish they'd stray off far enough to fall down about 2,000 feet of gorge.
Why'd you offer to carry his goods for him?
As if he couldn't manage by himself.
He knew what he was doing when he turned them over to us.
Mighty cute of him, wasn't it?
What's the use of railing against the old man? It won't do any good.
Save your breath for the next piece of trail.
I'm stopping here for the night.
If you want to go on it's okay with me, but take his burros with you.
They ain't my responsibility.
It's early. We can make four, five miles more before dark.
Nobody ordered you to stay here.
You can go 20 miles more for all I care.
Ordered me?
You?
Who's ordering who to do anything?
You talk like you're boss of this outfit.
Maybe you are, let's hear you say it.
All right, if you can't go any further.
Who says I can't? Don't make me laugh.
I can go four times as far as a mug like you.
But I don't want to. I could if I want to, but I don't want to, see, mug?
What's the use of hollering?
We're started on something and we've got to finish it, like it or not.
We'll camp here.
Wonder what the old man's doing now.
Eating a meal of roast turkey and drinking a bottle of tequila probably.
This is the first day we've had to manage without his help.
Once we get the hang of it, it'll be easier.
How far away do you suppose the railroad is?
- Not so far as the crow flies.
- We ain't crows.
I figure we can reach the high-pass in two days more... then it'll be three or four days to the railroad.
That's figuring no hard luck on the trail, of course.
What's the joke, Dobbsie?
Aren't you going to let me in on it?
In on it? Sure I will.
Sure.
Go ahead, spill it. What's so funny?
I was thinking what a bonehead play that old jackass made...
- when he put all his goods in our keeping.
- What do you mean?
Figured he'd let us do his sweating for him, did he?
- We'll show him.
- What are you getting at?
Can't you see? It's all ours.
We don't go back to Durango at all.
Not at all.
I don't follow you.
Don't be such a sap.
Where did you ever grow up?
All right, to make it clear to a dumbhead like you... we take all his goods and go straight up north and leave the jackass flat.
You aren't serious, are you? You don't really mean what you are saying.
Fred C. Dobbs don't say nothing he don't mean.
As long as I'm here and can do anything, you won't touch the old man's goods.
I know exactly what you mean.
You want to take it all for yourself and cut me out.
No, I'm on the level with the old man, like I'd be with you if you weren't here.
Get off your soapbox. You only sound foolish out here in this wilderness.
I know you for what you are.
For a long time I've had my suspicions about you and now I know I've been right.
- What suspicions?
- You're not putting anything over on me.
I see right through you.
For a long time you've wanted to bump me off at the first opportunity... and bury me out here in the bush like a dog... so you could take not only the old man's goods but mine in the bargain.
When you get to Durango safely you'll have a big laugh... thinking how dumb the old man and I were.
You make another move towards me and I'll pull the trigger.
Now, get your hands up.
Come on, get them up.
Was I right, or was I?
You and your Sunday school talk about protecting people's goods.
You. Go on, stand up, and take it like a man.
Come on, get up.
Let go of it.
- The cards are dealt the other way now.
- Yeah.
Now listen to me...
Look, you're all wrong.
Not for a moment did I ever intend to rob you or do you any harm.
Just like I said...
I'd fight for you and yours like I'd fight for the old man's.
If you really mean that give me back my gun.
My pal.
Wouldn't it be better the way things are to separate tomorrow or even tonight?
- That would suit you fine, wouldn't it?
- Why me more than you?
So you could fall on me from behind, sneak up and shoot me in the back.
All right, I'll go first.
And wait for me on the trail to ambush me?
Why wouldn't I do it now if I meant to kill you?
I'll tell you why, because you're yellow.
You don't have the nerve to pull the trigger while I'm looking you in the eye.
If you think like that, there's nothing to do but to tie you up every night.
I'll tell you what. I'll make you a little bet.
Three times 35 is 105.
I'll bet $105,000 you go to sleep before I do.
Get up there at the head of the train.
Get up!
The cards are dealt the other way now, and for the last time. No more shuffling.
- What cards are...
- I'm going to finish this right now.
I won't take orders from you like I had to do today.
- You mean you're going to murder me?
- No, brother, not murder. Your mistake.
I'm doing it to save my life that you'd take from me when I wasn't looking at you.
- The old man'll catch up with you.
- He will, will he?
I got an answer for that one, too.
Know what I'll tell him?
I'll tell him you tied me to a tree and made your getaway taking all our goods.
He'll be looking for you and not me.
Up. March. Today I had to march to your music, now you march to mine.
- Where?
- To your funeral.
Come on, keep going.
Get up. Sleepy?
You'll be asleep soon enough.
Sound asleep.
Maybe I didn't kill him.
Maybe he just staggered and fell down without being hit.
You keep it, it's yours anyhow.
No, they won't find him.
I'll dig a hole for him first thing in the morning.
This fire... don't give much heat.
Conscience.
What a thing.
If you believe you've got a conscience, it'll pester you to death.
But if you don't believe you've got one... what can it do to you?
Makes me sick all this talking and fussing about nonsense.
Maybe I'd better leave him like he is.
Ain't very likely anybody will find him.
In a week, the buzzards and the ants will have done away with him anyway.
I don't know what's getting into me.
Was that really a tiger?
No.
What if his eyes are open, looking at me?
Best thing to do is to get to the railroad in a hurry.
Burro.
It's better not to have buried him.
I did right, yeah.
What I should have done, maybe, was bury his clothes... and leave him to the ants and the buzzards.
Buzzards!
If somebody saw them circling, they'd know something was dead.
Buzzards ain't spotted him yet.
Lucky for me.
Curtin!
Where are you?
I better get a hold of myself.
I mustn't lose my head.
There's one thing certain, he ain't here.
I got it. The tiger.
Yeah, that's it. The tiger must have dragged him off to his lair, that's what.
Yeah, pretty soon, not even the bones will be left to tell the story.
Done as if by order.
I came to in the middle of the night.
My gun was on the ground beside me.
He must have left it there to make it look like suicide.
I figured he'd come back in the morning to see if I still had a flicker of life.
I thought about waiting for him and letting him have it... but there was a good chance in my condition I might miss... so I decided to crawl away like a poisoned dog.
- Take it easy, you're talking too much.
- Don't you worry about me.
I'll pull out of this if only to get that guy.
It appears our fine Mr. Dobbs has made off with our goods and is on his way north.
- Yeah.
- I reckon we can't blame him too much.
What do you mean?
I mean, he's not a real killer, as killers go.
I think he's as honest as the next fella, or almost.
The mistake was leaving you two in the depths of the wilderness... with more than $100,000 between you.
That's a big temptation, partner, believe me.
He shot me down in cold blood.
After I was down he shot me a second time just to make sure.
If I was young and out there with one of you, I'd have been tempted, too.
Maybe I wouldn't have fallen, but I reckon I would've been tempted.
There now. You're almost as good as new.
Now, to find that thief and get our goods back.
They're not only giving me a horse but coming to protect me.
- You ain't going.
- Who says so?
You wouldn't be up to the hard riding.
- You aren't leaving me behind.
- Look at you.
You're weak as a kitten.
Don't worry, I'll look after our interests.
I'm going.
Well, I reckon you're going.
Burro!
Have you got any cigarettes?
No, I haven't. I've got a little tobacco... if that'll do.
No paper to roll it in?
Papers?
Here you are.
- Going to Durango?
- Yeah.
That's where I'm headed.
I've got to sell my burros.
I got to get some money.
I haven't got a red cent.
Matches?
Money? We need money, too.
Yeah? I could use a good mule driver... maybe two or three.
How much is the pay?
Two pesos.
Of course, I can't pay you in advance...
I got to wait till I get to town so I can get the money.
Do I know you from someplace?
Maybe I know you.
No, I don't think so.
- Are you alone?
- No.
I'm not alone.
I got a couple of friends coming along on horseback.
Yeah, they ought to be here any minute.
That's funny.
A man all by himself in bandit country with a string of burros... and his friends behind him on horseback.
Your friends must be very far behind you.
Pablo cannot see any dust even from their horses.
They'll be along any minute, I tell you.
I know who you are.
You're the guy in the hole.
The one who wouldn't give us the rifle.
I never laid eyes on you until now.
What you got in the bags?
- Seems to me like hides.
- Yeah.
That's what they are, hides.
Ought to bring in quite a lot of money.
Yeah.
Sure you don't want to come along with me and help me with the burros?
Burro.
Get away from my burro.
We can sell those burros for just as good a price as you'd get.
Get away from my burro.
You can't frighten even a sick louse with that. You can only shoot one of us... and he wouldn't mind too much.
The federales are after him anyway.
So what with your gun?
- We'll take that chance.
- Get back there.
- Shooting.
- Volley. Execution, probably.
- Dobbs is dead.
- What?
- Bandits got him.
- Our goods. What about our goods?
- What?
- He says our goods are safe in his office.
- It's not here, Howard.
- Keep your shirt on.
What?
He heard the bandits talking while they were waiting to be shot.
They thought it was bags of sand hidden among the hide... to make it weigh more when Dobbs went to sell them.
Where are they?
They're in the ruins outside town.
Come on!
Looks like a norther.
Laugh, Curtin, old boy, it's a great joke played on us... by the Lord, or fate, or nature, whatever you prefer... but whoever or whatever played it certainly had a sense of humor!
The gold has gone back to where we found it!
This is worth ten months of suffering and labor, this joke is!
Well, Howard, what next I wonder?
I'm all fixed as far as I'm concerned as a medicine man.
I'll have three meals a day, five if I want... roof over my head, and a drink now and then to warm me up.
I will be worshipped, fed, and treated like a high priest... for telling people what they want to hear.
Good medicine men are born, not made.
Come and see me sometime, my boy.
Even you'll take off your hat when you see how respected I am.
The day before yesterday, they wanted to make me their legislature.
Their whole legislature!
I don't know what that means. I think it's the highest honor they can bestow.
Yeah, I'm all fixed for the rest of my natural life.
How about yourself?
What do you aim to do?
I haven't got any idea.
You're young. You've got plenty of time to make three or four fortunes.
You know, the worst ain't so bad when it finally happens.
Not half as bad as you figure it'll be before it happens.
I'm no worse off than I was in Tampico.
All I'm out is $200 when you come right down to it.
Not very much compared to what Dobbsie lost.
Any special place you're bent on going?
No, all places are the same to me.
You can keep my share of what the burros and the hides'll bring... if you use it to buy a ticket to Dallas.
See Cody's widow. Better than writing.
And besides, it's July and the fruit harvest.
How about it?
It's a deal.
Well, let's get going.
- Goodbye, Curtin.
- Goodbye, Howard.
- Good luck.
- Same to you.
Last night, I dreamt I went to Manderley again.
It seemed to me I stood by the iron gate leading to the drive,
and for a while, I could not enter, for the way was barred to me.
Then, like all dreamers,
I was possessed of a sudden with supernatural powers
and passed like a spirit through the barrier before me.
The drive wound away in front of me,
twisting and turning as it had always done.
But as I advanced,
I was aware that a change had come upon it.
Nature had come into her own again, and little by little
had encroached upon the drive with long, tenacious fingers.
On and on wound the poor thread that had once been our drive,
and finally, there was Manderley.
Manderley, secretive and silent.
Time could not mar the perfect symmetry of those walls.
Moonlight can play odd tricks upon the fancy,
and suddenly it seemed to me that light came from the windows.
And then a cloud came upon the moon
and hovered an instant like a dark hand before a face.
The illusion went with it.
I looked upon a desolate shell
with no whisper of the past about its staring walls.
We can never go back to Manderley again.
That much is certain.
But sometimes in my dreams,
I do go back
to the strange days of my life
which began for me in the South of France.
No! Stop!
What the devil are you shouting about?
Who are you? 
What are you staring at?
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to stare, but I... I only thought...
Oh, you did, did you?
Well, what are you doing here?
I was only walking.
Well, get on with your walking.
Don't hang about here screaming.
I'll never come to Monte Carlo out of season again.
Not a single well-known personality in the hotel.
Stone cold. Waiter!
Garçon! Call him.
Tell him to get me some...
Why, it's Max de Winter.
How do you do?
How do you do?
I'm Edythe Van Hopper.
It's so nice to run into you here, just when I was beginning to despair of finding any old friends here in Monte.
But do sit down and have some coffee.
Mr. de Winter is having some coffee with me.
Go and ask that stupid waiter for another cup.
I'm afraid I must contradict you.
You shall both have coffee with me.
Garçon. Coffee, please.
- Cigarette?
- No, thank you.
You know, I recognized you just as soon as you came in, though I haven't seen you since that night at the casino at Palm Beach.
Perhaps you don't remember an old woman like me.
Are you playing the tables much here at Monte?
No. I'm afraid that sort of thing ceased to amuse me years ago.
I can well understand that.
As for me, if I had a home like Manderley,
I should certainly never come to Monte.
I hear it's one of the biggest places in that part of the country, and you just can't beat it for beauty.
What do you think of Monte Carlo?
Or don't you think of it at all?
Well, I think it's rather artificial.
She's spoiled, Mr. de Winter, that's her trouble.
Most girls will give their eyes for a chance to see Monte.
Wouldn't that rather defeat the purpose?
Now that we've found each other again,
I hope I shall see something of you.
You must come and have a drink in my suite.
I hope they've given you a good room.
The place is empty, so if you're uncomfortable, mind you make a fuss.
Your valet has unpacked for you, I suppose?
I'm afraid I don't possess one.
Perhaps you would like to do it for me?
Well, I... I hardly think...
Perhaps you could make yourself useful to Mr. de Winter if he wants anything done.
You're a capable child in many ways.
That's a charming suggestion, but I'm afraid I cling to the old motto,
"He travels fastest who travels alone."
Perhaps you've not heard it. Good night.
What do you make of that?
Do you suppose that sudden departure was intended to be funny?
Come, don't sit there gawking, let's go upstairs.
- Have you got the key?
- Yes, Mrs. Van Hopper.
I remember, when I was younger, there was a well-known writer who used to dart down the back way whenever he saw me coming.
I suppose he was in love with me and wasn't quite sure of himself.
Well, c'est la vie.
By the way, my dear, don't think that I mean to be unkind, but you were just a teeny-weeny bit forward with Mr. de Winter.
Your effort to enter the conversation quite embarrassed me, and I'm sure it did him.
Men loathe that sort of thing.
Oh, come, don't sulk. After all,
I am responsible for your behavior here.
Perhaps he didn't notice it.
Poor thing, I suppose he just can't get over his wife's death.
They say he simply adored her.
Oh... How awkward of me.
What a stupid thing to do.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Please don't bother.
It doesn't really matter.
No, leave that, leave that.
Go and lay another place at my table.
- Mademoiselle will have lunch with me.
- Oh, but I couldn't possibly.
- Why not?
- Oh, well, please don't be polite. I...
It's very kind of you but I'll be all right if they just change the cloth.
I wasn't being polite.
I should have asked you to have lunch with me even if you hadn't upset the vase so clumsily.
Come along.
We needn't talk to each other if we don't feel like it.
Well, thank you very much.
Oh, I... I'll just have some scrambled eggs.
Oui, mademoiselle.
- What's happened to your friend?
- She's ill in bed with a cold.
I'm sorry I was so rude to you yesterday.
The only excuse I can offer is that
I've become boorish through living alone.
You weren't really.
You simply wanted to be alone and...
Tell me, is Mrs. Van Hopper a friend of yours or just a relation?
No, she's my employer.
I'm what is known as "a paid companion."
I didn't know companionship could be bought.
I looked at the word "companion" in the dictionary once.
It said, "a friend of the bosom."
I don't envy you the privilege.
Well, she's very kind, really, and I have to earn my living.
Haven't you any family?
No. My mother died years and years ago, and there was only my father, and he died last summer.
And then I took this job.
How rotten for you.
Yes, it was rather, because, you see, we got on so well together.
You and your father?
Yes. He was a lovely person, very unusual.
- What was he?
- A painter.
Was he a good one?
Well, I thought so, but people didn't understand him.
Yes, that's often the trouble.
He painted trees. At least, it was one tree.
You mean, he painted the same tree over and over again?
Yes. You see, he had a theory that if you should find one perfect thing or place or person, you should stick to it.
Do you think that's really silly?
Not at all.
I'm a firm believer in that myself.
And what did you find to do with yourself while he was painting his tree?
Well, I sat with him and I sketched a little.
I don't do it very well, though.
Were you going sketching this afternoon?
Yes.
- Where?
- Well, I haven't made up my mind.
I'll drive you somewhere in the car.
Oh, no, please, I didn't mean...
Oh, nonsense. Finish up that mess, and we'll get along.
Thank you. It's very kind of you, but I'm not very hungry.
Come on. Eat it up like a good girl.
You've taken long enough for that sketch.
I shall expect a really fine work of art.
Oh, no, don't look at it.
It's not nearly good enough.
Well, it can't be as bad as all that.
Now don't rub it all out.
Let me see it first.
Well, it's the perspective.
I never can get it right.
Let me see it, let me see it.
Oh, dear.
Tell me, is it the perspective that gives my nose that curious twist in the middle?
Well, you're not a very easy subject to sketch. Your...
Your expression keeps changing all the time.
Does it?
Well, I'd... I'd concentrate on the view instead, if I were you.
Much more worthwhile.
It rather reminds me of our coastline at home.
Do you know Cornwall at all?
Yes, I went there once with my father on holiday.
I was in a shop once, and I saw a postcard with a beautiful house on it, right by the sea.
I asked whose house it was, and the old lady said, "That's Manderley."
I felt ashamed for not knowing.
Manderley is beautiful.
But to me, it's just the place where I was born, and have lived in all my life.
But now, I don't suppose
I shall ever see it again.
We're lucky not to be home during the bad weather, aren't we?
I can't ever remember enjoying swimming in England till June, can you?
The water's so warm here that I could stay in all day.
There's a dangerous undertow and there was a man drowned here last year.
I never have any fear of drowning.
Have you?
Come, I'll take you home.
Oh, yes, I know Mr. de Winter well.
I knew his wife, too.
Before she married, she was the beautiful Rebecca Hildreth, you know.
She was drowned, poor dear, while she was sailing near Manderley.
He never talks about it, of course, but he's a broken man.
I suppose I'd better have it.
Wretched stuff!
Give me a chocolate, quick!
Oh, there you are. It's about time.
Hurry up. I want to play some rummy.
She was the beautiful Rebecca Hildreth, you know.
They say he simply adored her.
She was the beautiful Rebecca Hildreth, you know.
I suppose he just can't get over his wife's death.
She was the beautiful Rebecca Hildreth, you know.
But he's a broken man.
Bonjour.
- Well, where are you going?
- I thought I'd take a tennis lesson.
I see.
I suppose you've had a look at the pro, and he's desperately handsome, and you've conceived a schoolgirl crush on him.
All right. Go ahead.
Make the most of it.
Off duty?
Well, yes. Mrs. Van Hopper's cold's turned into flu, so she's got a trained nurse.
I'm sorry for the nurse.
You keen on tennis?
- Well, not particularly.
- That's good. We'll go for a drive.
Good afternoon, Mrs. Van Hopper.
How are you feeling?
You got on rather well with him, didn't you?
That pro must have been teaching you other things than tennis.
Hurry up, I want you to make some calls.
I wonder if Mr. de Winter is still in the hotel.
May I go now?
For the number of lessons you've had, you ought to be ready for Wimbledon.
But this will be your last, so make the most of it.
The trouble is, with me laid up like this, you haven't had enough to do.
I'm getting rid of that nurse today.
And from now on, you'll stick to your job.
Yes, Mrs. Van Hopper.
- Nurse?
- Yes, Mrs. Hopper?
Are you absolutely sure you left those messages for Mr. de Winter?
- Why, yes, madame.
- I simply can't believe it.
He would most certainly have called me back.
Oh, well. Poor boy, I simply hate to see him so alone.
You know, I...
I wish there could be an invention that bottled up the memory, like perfume, and it never faded, never got stale.
Then whenever I wanted to,
I could uncork the bottle and live the memory all over again.
And what particular moment in your young life would you want to keep?
All of them. All these last few days.
I feel as though I'd... I'd collected a whole shelf full of bottles.
Sometimes, you know, those little bottles contain demons that have a way of popping out at you, just as you're trying most desperately to forget.
Stop biting your nails.
I wish I were a woman of 36, dressed in black satin with a string of pearls.
You wouldn't be here with me if you were.
Would you please tell me, Mr. de Winter, why you asked me to come out with you?
It's obvious you want to be kind, but why do you choose me for your charity?
I asked you to come out with me because I wanted your company.
You've blotted out the past for me more than all the bright lights of Monte Carlo.
But if you think I just asked you out of kindness or charity, you can leave the car now and find your own way home.
Go on. Open the door and get out.
- Better blow your nose.
- Thank you.
Please don't call me Mr. de Winter.
I have a very impressive array of first names.
George Fortescue Maximilian.
You needn't bother with them all at once.
My family call me Maxim.
And another thing, please promise me never to wear black satin or pearls, or to be 36 years old.
Yes, Maxim.
For the love of Pete! Come here!
What do you think?
My daughter's engaged to be married.
Oh, really? How nice!
We must leave for New York at once.
Get reservations on the Aquitania, and we'll take the 12:30 train for Cherbourg.
Hurry up and get me the maid to help with the packing.
We've no time to waste.
Go on and don't dawdle.
Mr. de Winter, please.
He's gone out riding?
He won't be back till noon?
Give me the porter, please.
I'll go and see if there's anything left in my room.
Has Mr. de Winter come in yet?
Oh, he has?
Would you connect me, please?
I was looking for my book.
I suppose I've packed it.
Well, come on, the car's waiting at the door.
I'd like to leave a forwarding address, if they happen to find that book.
- Would you ring Mr. de Winter, please?
- Yes, madame.
- There isn't any answer.
- Thank you.
- Tell her to hurry up!
- Yes, madame.
I was looking for Mr. de Winter.
Mr. de Winter just ordered breakfast in his room, mademoiselle.
Come in.
Hello. What are you doing here?
Anything the matter?
I've come to say goodbye.
We're going away.
What on Earth are you talking about?
It's true. We're going now, and I was afraid
I wouldn't see you again.
- Where's she taking you to?
- New York. I don't want to go.
I shall hate it.
I shall be miserable.
I'll dress in here.
I shan't be long.
Which would you prefer,
New York or Manderley?
Oh, please don't joke about it.
Mrs. Van Hopper's waiting.
I'd better say goodbye now.
I'll repeat what I said.
Either you go to America with Mrs. Van Hopper, or you come home to Manderley with me.
You mean you want a secretary or something?
I'm asking you to marry me, you little fool.
Come in.
Is that my food? I'm famished.
I didn't have any breakfast.
My suggestion didn't seem to go at all well. Sorry.
Oh, but you don't understand.
It's the...
- I'm not the sort of person men marry.
- What on Earth do you mean?
I don't belong in your sort of world, for one thing.
Well, what is my sort of world?
Well, Manderley. You know what I mean.
Well, I'm the best judge of whether you belong there or not.
Of course, if you don't love me, that's a different thing.
Fine blow to my conceit, that's all.
I do love you.
I love you most dreadfully.
I've been crying all morning because I thought I'd never see you again.
Bless you for that.
I'll remind you of this one day and you won't believe me.
It's a pity you have to grow up.
Well, now that's settled.
You may pour me out some coffee.
Two lumps of sugar and some milk, please.
Same with my tea, don't forget.
Who is going to break the news to Mrs. Van Hopper?
Shall you or should I?
You tell her. She'll be so angry.
What's the number of her room?
She's not there.
She's downstairs in the car.
Hello. Give me the desk, please.
Hello. You'll find Mrs. Van Hopper waiting outside in her car.
Would you ask her, with my compliments, if she'd very kindly come up and see me in my room?
Yes, in my room.
Mr. de Winter says please for you to come up to his room.
Mr. de Winter?
Why, certainly.
This isn't at all your idea of a proposal, is it?
It should be in a conservatory, you in a white frock, with a red rose in your hand, and a violin playing in the distance, and I should be making violent love to you behind a palm tree.
Poor darling. Never mind.
I don't mind.
Don't worry. Don't worry.
You won't have to say a word.
I'm so glad you called me, Mr. de Winter.
I was making a hasty departure.
It was so rude of me not to let you know.
But a cable came this morning announcing that my daughter is engaged to be married.
That's rather a coincidence, Mrs. Van Hopper.
I asked you up here in order to tell you of my engagement.
You don't mean it.
How perfectly wonderful.
How romantic. Who is the lucky lady?
I apologize for depriving you of your companion in this abrupt way.
I do hope it won't inconvenience you too greatly.
When did all this happen?
Just now, Mrs. Van Hopper.
Just a few minutes ago.
I simply can't believe it.
And I suppose I ought to scold you for not having breathed a word of all of this to me.
What am I thinking of?
I should give you both my congratulations and my blessings.
I'm very happy for you both.
- When and where is the wedding to be?
- Here, as soon as possible.
A whirlwind romance. Splendid!
I can easily postpone my sailing for a week.
This poor child has no mother, so I shall take responsibility for all the arrangements.
Trousseau, reception and everything, and I'll give the bride away.
But our luggage.
Go down and tell the porter to take everything out of the car.
Just a minute.
We're most grateful, Mrs. Van Hopper, but I think we'd both prefer to have it all as quiet as possible.
And I couldn't possibly allow you to change your sailing plans.
- Oh, but...
- No, no, no.
Dear, I'll go down and see that your luggage is brought back.
Thank you, Maxim.
So this is what's been happening during my illness.
Tennis lessons, my foot.
I suppose I've to hand it to you for a fast worker.
How did you manage it?
Still waters certainly run deep.
Tell me, have you been doing anything you shouldn't?
- I don't know what you mean.
- Well, never mind.
I always did say that Englishmen have strange tastes.
You certainly have your work cut out as mistress of Manderley.
To be perfectly frank with you, my dear,
I can't see you doing it.
You haven't the experience, you haven't the faintest idea what it means to be a great lady.
Of course you know why he's marrying you, don't you?
You haven't flattered yourself that he's in love with you?
Fact is, that empty house got on his nerves to such an extent, he nearly went off his head.
He just couldn't go on living alone.
You'd better leave, Mrs. Van Hopper.
You'll miss your train.
Mrs. de Winter.
Goodbye, my dear, and good luck!
Monsieur!
What is he saying?
He says I've forgotten the proof that we're married.
Good heavens.
Somebody else had the same idea.
- Isn't she sweet?
- Yes.
You'd have liked a bridal veil, wouldn't you?
Or at least...
Oh, Maxim, how lovely.
How perfectly lovely.
Perfectly lovely.
- Welcome home, Mr. de Winter.
- Thank you, Smith.
- Cold, darling?
- Yes, just a little bit.
There's no need to be frightened, you know.
Just be yourself, and they'll all adore you.
You don't have to worry about the house at all.
Mrs. Danvers is the housekeeper.
Just leave it to her.
Hello. It's starting to rain.
We'd better hurry up.
Here. Have this. Put it over your head.
Thank you.
That's it. That's Manderley.
- Here we are. Frith, everybody well?
- Yes, thank you, sir.
Glad to see you home, sir.
- This is Mrs. de Winter, Frith.
- How do you do?
I didn't expect the whole staff to be in attendance.
Mrs. Danvers' orders, sir.
Oh. Sorry about this.
It won't take long.
This is Mrs. Danvers.
How do you do?
How do you do?
I have everything in readiness for you.
That's very good of you.
I... I didn't expect anything.
- I think we'd like some tea, Frith.
- Ready in the library, sir.
Come along, darling.
Oh, Maxim, come in.
Oh.
- Good evening, Mrs. Danvers.
- Good evening, madam.
- I hope Alice was satisfactory, madam.
- Oh, yes, thank you, perfectly.
She's the parlor maid.
She'll have to look after you until your own maid arrives.
Oh, but I haven't a maid.
I'm sure Alice will do very nicely.
I'm afraid that would not do for very long, madam.
It's usual for ladies in your position to have a personal maid.
I hope you approve the new decoration of these rooms, madam?
Oh, I didn't know it had been changed.
I hope you haven't been to too much trouble.
I only followed out
Mr. de Winter's instructions.
Well, what did it look like before?
It had an old paper and different hangings.
It was never used much except for occasional visitors.
Oh. Then it wasn't
Mr. de Winter's room originally?
No, madam.
He's never used the east wing before.
Of course, there's no view of the sea from here.
The only good view of the sea is from the west wing.
The room's very charming, and I'm sure I'll be comfortable.
If there's anything you want done, madam, you have only to tell me.
I suppose you've been at Manderley for many years, longer than anyone else.
Not so long as Frith.
He was here when the old gentleman was living, when Mr. de Winter was a boy.
Oh, I see.
And you didn't come till after that?
I came here when the first Mrs. de Winter was a bride.
Mrs. Danvers, I do hope we'll be friends.
You must be patient with me.
This sort of life is new to me and I do want to make a success of it, and make Mr. de Winter happy, so I know I can leave all the household arrangements to you.
Very well. I hope I shall do everything to your satisfaction, madam.
I've managed the house since Mrs. de Winter's death and Mr. de Winter has never complained.
I think I'll go downstairs now.
That room in the west wing I was telling you about is there, through that door.
It's not used now.
It's the most beautiful room in the house, the only one that looks down across the lawns to the sea.
It was Mrs. de Winter's room.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- You're Mrs. de Winter, aren't you?
- Yes.
My name's Crawley.
I manage the estate for Maxim.
Awfully glad to meet you.
A fearful lot of stuff piled up while Maxim was away.
Yes, I'm sure there must have been.
I do wish I could help with some of it.
No, no! Frank never allows anybody to help him.
He's like an old mother hen with his bills and rents and taxes.
Come on, Frank, we must go over these estimates.
I'll get my papers.
You'll find quantities of breakfast over there.
But you must eat it all, or Cook will be mortally offended.
I'll do my best, Maxim.
I have to go over the place with Frank, just to make sure that he hasn't lost any of it.
You'll be all right, won't you?
Getting acquainted with your new home?
Have a look at The Times.
There's a thrilling article on what's the matter with English cricket.
Oh, yes...
My sister, Beatrice, and her husband, Giles Lacy, have invited themselves over for lunch.
- Today?
- Yes.
I suppose the old girl can't wait to look you over.
You'll find her very direct.
If she doesn't like you, she'll probably tell you so to your face.
Don't worry, darling,
I'll be back in time to protect you from her.
- Goodbye, darling.
- Goodbye, Maxim.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- Good morning, madam.
- Good morning, Frith.
Isn't there anything
I could get for you, madam?
No, thank you, Frith.
I'm really not very hungry.
Thank you.
- The paper, madam.
- Oh, yes. Thank you, Frith.
I slipped.
Thank you, Frith.
- It's big, isn't it?
- Yes, madam, Manderley is a big place.
This was the banquet hall in the old days.
It's still used on great occasions, such as a big dinner or a ball.
And the public is admitted here, you know, once a week.
That's nice.
I beg pardon, madam.
I'm afraid the fire is not usually lit in the library until the afternoon.
But you'll find one in the morning room.
Of course, if you wish this fire lit now, madam...
No, Frith, I wouldn't dream of it.
Mrs. de Winter...
I mean, the late Mrs. de Winter always did her correspondence and telephoning in the morning room, after breakfast.
Thank you, Frith.
Is anything wrong, madam?
Oh, no. Which way is the morning room?
Oh, it's that door there, on the left.
Oh, yes, thank you.
Mrs. de Winter?
Oh, I'm afraid you've made a mistake.
Mrs. de Winter's been dead for over a year.
Oh, I mean...
Oh.
That was the house telephone, madam.
Probably the head gardener wishing instructions.
Did you want to see me, Mrs. Danvers?
Mr. de Winter informed me that his sister,
Mrs. Lacy, and Major Lacy are expected for luncheon.
I'd like to know if you approve of the menu.
Oh, well, I'm sure it's very suitable, very nice indeed.
You will notice, madam, that I've left a blank space for the sauce.
Mrs. de Winter was most particular about sauces.
Let's have whatever you think that Mrs. de Winter would have ordered.
Thank you, madam.
When you've finished your letters,
Robert will take them to the post.
My... My letters?
Oh, yes, of course.
Thank you, Mrs. Danvers.
- How are you, Frith?
- Good morning, Mrs. Lacy.
Where's Mr. de Winter?
I believe he went down to the farm with Mr. Crawley.
How tiresome of him not to be here when we arrive, and how typical.
I must say old Danvers keeps the house looking lovely.
She's certainly learned that trick of arranging flowers from Rebecca.
I wonder how she likes it now, being ordered about by an ex-chorus girl.
Now, where on Earth did you get the idea she's an ex-chorus girl?
He picked her up in the South of France, didn't he?
What if he did?
Well, I mean to say, there you are.
How do you do? I'm Maxim's wife.
How do you do?
Well, I must say you're quite different from what I expected.
Don't be so silly.
She's exactly what I told you she'd be.
Well, how do you like Manderley?
It's very beautiful, isn't it?
And how do you get along with Mrs. Danvers?
Well, I...
I've never met anyone quite like her before.
You mean, she scares you.
She's not exactly an oil painting, is she?
Giles, you're very much in the way here.
Go somewhere else.
Well, I'll try and find Maxim, shall I?
Giles.
I didn't mean to say anything against Mrs. Danvers.
Oh, there's no need for you to be frightened of her, but I shouldn't have any more to do with her than you can help.
- Shall we sit down?
- Yes. Yes, please.
You see, she's bound to be insanely jealous at first and she must resent you bitterly.
But why should she?
Don't you know?
I should have thought
Maxim would have told you.
She simply adored Rebecca.
- How are you, Robert?
- Quite well, thank you, madam.
- Still having trouble with your teeth?
- Unfortunately, yes, madam.
You must have them out, all of them.
- Wretched nuisances, teeth.
- Thank you, madam.
What a plateful.
Do you hunt?
No, I don't.
I'm afraid I don't even ride.
You have to ride down here, we all do.
Which do you ride, sidesaddle or astride?
Well, of course, I forgot.
You don't, do you?
You must. Nothing else to do around here.
Maxim, when are you going to have parties here again, like the old days?
I haven't thought about it.
- But everyone's dying to see you and...
- Yes, I bet they are.
Why don't you have the masquerade ball again this summer?
My dear, are you fond of dancing?
I love it, but I'm not very good at it.
Do you rumba?
- Never tried.
- You must teach me.
Actually, I'm trying to find out exactly what your wife does do.
She sketches a little.
Sketches.
Not this modern stuff, I hope, you know, portrait of a lampshade upside down to represent a soul in torment.
Don't sail, do you?
No, I don't.
Thank goodness for that.
You're very much in love with Maxim, aren't you?
Yes, I can see you are.
Don't mind my saying so, but why don't you do something about your hair?
Why don't you have it cut or sweep it back behind your ears?
Oh, no, that's worse.
What does Maxim say about it?
Does he like it like that?
Well, he never mentions it.
Oh, well, don't go by me.
I can see by the way you dress you don't care a hoot how you look.
But I wonder Maxim hasn't been at you.
He's so particular about clothes.
I don't think he ever notices what I wear.
Oh. He must have changed a lot, then.
You mustn't worry about old Maxim and his moods.
One never knows what goes on in that quiet mind of his.
Often, he gets into a terrible rage, and when he does...
I don't suppose he'll lose his temper with you.
You seem such a placid little thing.
Come on, old girl.
We've got to go on the first tee at 3:00.
All right, I'm coming.
Well, goodbye, Maxim, old boy.
Goodbye, Giles.
Thanks for coming, old boy.
Goodbye, my dear.
Forgive me for asking you so many rude questions.
We both really hope you'll be very happy.
Thank you, Beatrice, thank you very much.
And I must congratulate you upon the way Maxim looks.
We were very worried about him this time last year.
But then, of course, you know the whole story.
- Goodbye, Beatrice.
- Goodbye, old boy.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Well, thank heavens they've gone.
Now we can have a walk about the place.
Looks as though we might have a shower.
But you won't mind that, will you?
No, but wait a minute.
I'll go upstairs and get a coat.
There's a heap of mackintoshes in the flower room. Robert?
Run and get a coat from the flower room for Mrs. de Winter, will you?
What do you think of Beatrice?
Oh, I liked her very much, but she kept saying that I was quite different from what she expected.
What the devil did she expect?
Oh, someone smarter and more sophisticated, I'm afraid.
Do you like my hair?
Your hair? Yes, of course I do.
What's the matter with it?
Oh, I don't know. I just wondered.
How funny you are.
Thank you.
- Do I have to put it on?
- Yes, certainly, certainly, certainly.
You can't be too careful with children.
Come on, Jasper.
Come and take some of that fat off.
Jasper! Here. Not that way! Come here!
Where does that lead to?
Oh, it leads to a little cove where we used to keep a boat.
Oh, let's go down there.
Well, no. It's a perfectly dull, uninteresting stretch of sand,
- just like any other.
- Oh, please.
Well, all right. We'll walk down and take a look if you really want to.
That's Jasper.
There must be something wrong.
- Perhaps he's hurt himself.
- No, he's all right, leave him alone.
Don't you think I'd better go and see?
Don't bother about him, I tell you, he can't come to any harm.
He'll find his own way back!
Jasper! Jasper?
Oh, there you are.
What do you want in there, Jasper?
Come on. Come on home. Let's go home.
Jasper...
Oh.
I didn't know that there was anybody...
I know that dog.
He comes from the house.
He ain't yours.
No. He's Mr. de Winter's dog.
Have you anything I could tie him with?
Come on, Jasper.
You won't tell anyone you saw me in there, will you?
Don't you belong on the estate?
I weren't doing nothing.
I was just putting me shells away.
She's gone in the sea, ain't she?
She'll never come back no more.
No. She'll never come back.
Come on, Jasper.
Maxim! What's the matter?
Maxim!
I'm sorry I was such a time, but I had to find a rope for Jasper.
Hurry up, Jasper, for heaven's sake.
Please wait for me. Maxim, what is it?
You look so angry.
You knew I didn't want you to go there, but you deliberately went.
Why not? There was only a cottage down there and a strange man who...
- You didn't go in the cottage, did you?
- Yes, the door was...
- Don't go there again, do you hear?
- Well, why not?
Because I hate the place.
And if you had my memories, you wouldn't go there or talk about it or even think about it.
What's the matter?
Oh, I'm sorry, please.
We should have stayed away.
We should never have come back to Manderley.
Oh, what a fool I was.
I've made you unhappy.
Somehow, I've hurt you.
Oh, I can't bear to see you like this because I love you so much.
Do you?
Do you?
I've made you cry.
Forgive me.
I sometimes seem to fly off the handle for no reason at all.
Don't I?
Come, we'll go home and have some tea and forget all about it.
Yes, let's forget all about it.
Here, let me have Jasper.
- Hello. Come in.
- Oh, please don't get up, Mr. Crawley.
I was just wondering if you meant what you said the other day
- about showing me the run of things.
- Of course I did.
What are you doing now?
Notifying all the tenants that in celebration of Maxim's return with his bride, this week's rent will be free.
Oh, is that Maxim's idea?
Oh, yes, all the servants get an extra week's wages, too.
Oh, he didn't tell me.
Can't I help you?
I could at least lick the stamps.
Well, that's terribly nice of you.
Won't you sit down?
Yes, thank you.
I was down at the cottage on the beach the other day.
There was a man there, a queer sort of person.
Jasper kept barking at him.
Oh, yes, it must have been Ben.
Excuse me. He's quite harmless.
We give him odd jobs now and then.
That cottage bay seemed to be going to rack and ruin.
Why isn't something done about it?
I think if Maxim wanted anything done about it, he'd tell me.
Are those all Rebecca's things down there?
Yes.
Yes, they are.
What did she use the cottage for?
The boat used to be moored near there.
What boat? What happened to it?
Was that the boat she was sailing in when she was drowned?
Yes. It capsized and sank.
She was washed overboard.
Wasn't she afraid to go out like that alone?
She wasn't afraid of anything.
Where did they find her?
Near Edgecombe, about 40 miles up channel about two months afterwards.
Maxim went up to identify her.
It was horrible for him.
Yes, it must have been.
Mr. Crawley, please don't think me morbidly curious.
It isn't that. It's...
It's just that I feel at such a disadvantage.
All the time, whenever I meet anyone,
Maxim's sister or even the servants,
I know they're all thinking the same thing, that they're all comparing me with her, with Rebecca.
You mustn't think that.
I can't tell you how glad I am that you married Maxim.
It's going to make all the difference to his life.
From my point of view, it's very refreshing to find someone like yourself, who's not entirely in tune, shall we say, with Manderley.
That's very sweet of you.
I daresay I've been stupid, but every day I realize the things she had that I lack.
Beauty and wit and intelligence, and all the things that are so important in a woman.
You have qualities that are just as important, more important, if I may say so.
Kindliness and sincerity, and if you'll forgive me, modesty, mean more to a husband than all the wit and beauty in the world.
We, none of us want to live in the past,
Maxim least of all.
It's up to you, you know, to lead us away from it.
Right.
I promise you I won't bring this up again, but before we end this conversation, would you answer just one more question?
If it's something I'm able to answer,
I'll do my best.
Tell me, what was Rebecca really like?
I suppose...
I suppose she was the most beautiful creature I ever saw.
Good evening, Maxim.
Hello. The films of the honeymoon have arrived at last.
Do we have time, do you think, before dinner?
What on Earth have you done to yourself?
Oh, nothing. I just ordered a new dress from London.
I hope you don't mind.
Oh, no, no. Only, do you think that sort of thing's right for you?
- It doesn't seem your type at all.
- I thought you'd like it.
And what have you done to your hair?
Oh, I see.
Dear, oh, dear. I'm sorry.
You look lovely, lovely.
It's very nice, for a change.
- Shall we see these pictures?
- Yes. I'd love to see them.
Look now, look at that.
Wasn't it wonderful, darling?
Can't we go back there someday?
Yes, of course. Of course.
Look at you.
Won't our grandchildren be delighted when they see how lovely you were?
Oh, look at you.
Oh, I like that.
Look at that.
Yes, very nice.
- Remember that?
- Yes.
I wish our honeymoon could have lasted forever, Maxim.
Dash it, look.
Hang it.
I've threaded it up wrong as usual or something.
Yes, Frith. What is it?
Excuse me, sir.
May I have a word with you?
Yes. Come in.
It's about Robert, sir.
There's been a slight unpleasantness between him and Mrs. Danvers.
Oh, dear.
- Robert is very upset.
- This is trouble.
What is it?
It appears that Mrs. Danvers has accused Robert of stealing a valuable ornament from the morning room.
Robert denies the accusation most emphatically, sir.
- What was the thing, anyway?
- China cupid, sir.
Oh, dear. That's one of our treasures, isn't it?
Well, tell Mrs. Danvers to get to the bottom of it somehow.
- Tell her I'm sure it wasn't Robert.
- Very good, sir.
Why do they come to me with these things?
That's your job, sweetheart.
Maxim, I wanted to tell you, but I forgot.
The fact is, I broke the china cupid.
You broke it?
Now, why on Earth didn't you say something about it when Frith was here?
I don't know. I didn't like to.
I was afraid he'd think me a fool.
He'll think you much more of a fool now.
You'll have to explain to him and Mrs. Danvers.
Oh, no, Maxim.
You do it. I'll go upstairs.
Don't be such a little idiot, darling.
Anybody would think you were afraid of them.
It's all a mistake, Mrs. Danvers.
Apparently, Mrs. de Winter broke the cupid herself and forgot to say anything about it.
I'm so sorry. I never thought that I'd get Robert into trouble.
Is it possible to repair the ornament, madam?
No, I'm afraid it isn't.
It smashed into pieces.
What did you do with the pieces?
Well, I put them at the back of one of the drawers in the writing desk.
Well, it looks as though
Mrs. de Winter was afraid you were going to put her in prison, doesn't it, Mrs. Danvers?
Well, never mind.
Do what you can to find the pieces.
See if they can be mended, and above all, tell Robert to dry his tears.
I shall apologize to Robert, of course.
Perhaps if such a thing happens again,
Mrs. de Winter will tell me personally.
Yes, yes, all right.
Thank you, Mrs. Danvers.
Well, I suppose that clip will hold all right.
I don't know.
I'm awfully sorry, darling.
It was very careless of me.
- Mrs. Danvers must be furious with me.
- Hang Mrs. Danvers.
Why on Earth should you be frightened of her?
You behave more like an upstairs maid or something,
- not the mistress of the house at all.
- Yes, I know I do.
But I feel so uncomfortable.
I try my best every day, but it's very difficult with people looking me up and down as if I were a prize cow.
What does it matter if they do?
You must remember that life at Manderley is the only thing that interests anybody down here.
What a slap in the eye
I must have been to them, then.
I suppose that's why you married me, because you knew I was dull and gauche and inexperienced, and there'd never be any gossip about me.
Gossip? What do you mean?
I don't know.
I just said it for something to say.
Don't look at me like that. Maxim.
What's the matter? What have I said?
Wasn't a very attractive thing to say, was it?
No. It was rude, hateful.
I wonder if I did a very selfish thing in marrying you.
How do you mean?
I'm not much of a companion to you, am I?
You don't get much fun, do you?
You ought to have married a boy, someone of your own age.
Maxim, why do you say this?
Of course we're companions.
Are we? I don't know.
- I'm very difficult to live with.
- No, you're not difficult.
You're easy, very easy.
Our marriage is a success, isn't it, a great success?
We're happy, aren't we?
Terribly happy?
If you don't think we are happy, it would be much better if you didn't pretend.
I'll go away.
Why don't you answer me?
How can I answer you when I don't know the answer myself?
If you say we're happy, let's leave it at that.
Happiness is something I know nothing about.
Oh, look. There's the one when I left the camera running on the tripod, remember?
Pardon me, madam.
Is there anything I can do for you?
I'm all right, Hilda.
Thank you very much.
I'll bring the sandwiches immediately, madam.
- Hilda.
- Yes, madam?
The west wing.
Nobody ever uses it anymore, do they?
No, madam.
Not since the death of Mrs. de Winter.
Come along, Mr. Jack, or someone may see you.
Well, Danny, old harpy, it's been good to see you again.
I've been simply breathless to pick up all the news.
I really don't think it's wise for you to come here, Mr. Jack.
Jasper, come here.
Oh, nonsense, nonsense.
It's just like coming back home.
Quiet, Mr. Jack.
Yes. We must be careful not to shock Cinderella, mustn't we?
She's in the morning room.
If you leave through the garden door, she won't see you.
I must say, I feel a little like the poor relation, sneaking around through back doors.
Well, toodle-oo, Danny.
Goodbye, Mr. Jack, and please be careful.
Jasper, be quiet.
Looking for me?
- I didn't make you jump, did I?
- No.
Of course not.
I didn't quite know who it was.
Yes. You're pleased to see me, aren't you, old boy?
I'm glad there's someone in the family to welcome me back to Manderley.
And how is dear old Max?
Very well, thank you.
I hear he went up to London, left his little bride all alone.
It's too bad.
Isn't he rather afraid that somebody might come down and carry you off?
Danny, all your precautions were in vain.
The mistress of the house was hiding behind the door.
Oh. What about presenting me to the bride?
This is Mr. Favell, madam.
How do you do?
How do you do?
- Won't you have some tea or something?
- Now, isn't that a charming invitation?
I've been asked to tea, Danny, and I've a good mind to accept.
Oh, well, perhaps you're right.
Pity, just when we were getting on so nicely.
We mustn't lead the young bride astray, must we, Jasper?
Goodbye. It's been fun meeting you.
Oh, and by the way, it would be very decent of you if you didn't mention this little visit to your revered husband.
He doesn't exactly approve of me.
- Very well.
- That's very sporting of you.
I wish I had a young bride of three months waiting for me at home.
I'm just a lonely old bachelor.
Fare thee well.
Oh, and I know what was wrong with that introduction.
Danny didn't tell you, did she?
I am Rebecca's favorite cousin.
Toodle-oo!
Do you wish anything, madam?
I didn't expect to see you, Mrs. Danvers.
I noticed that a window wasn't closed and I came up to see
- if I could fasten it.
- Why did you say that?
I closed it before I left the room.
You opened it yourself, didn't you?
You've always wanted to see this room, haven't you, madam?
Why did you never ask me to show it to you?
I was ready to show it to you every day.
It's a lovely room, isn't it?
Loveliest room you've ever seen.
Everything is kept just as Mrs. de Winter liked it.
Nothing has been altered since that last night.
Come. I'll show you her dressing room.
This is where I keep all her clothes.
You would like to see them, wouldn't you?
Feel this.
It was a Christmas present from Mr. de Winter.
He was always giving her expensive gifts, the whole year round.
I keep her underwear on this side.
They were made specially for her by the nuns in the Convent of St. Claire.
I always used to wait up for her, no matter how late.
Sometimes she and Mr. de Winter didn't come home until dawn.
While she was undressing, she'd tell me about the party she'd been to.
She knew everyone that mattered.
Everyone loved her.
When she finished her bath, she'd go into the bedroom and go over to the dressing table.
Oh, you've moved her brush, haven't you?
There. That's better.
Just as she always laid it down.
"Come on, Danny. Hair drill," she would say.
And I'd stand behind her like this and brush away for 20 minutes at a time.
And then she would say,
"Good night, Danny," and step into her bed.
I embroidered this case for her myself, and I keep it here always.
Did you ever see anything so delicate?
Look. You can see my hand through it.
You wouldn't think she'd been gone so long, would you?
Sometimes when I walk along the corridor,
I fancy I hear her just behind me.
That quick light step.
I couldn't mistake it anywhere.
Not only in this room, it's in all the rooms in the house.
I can almost hear it now.
Do you think the dead come back and watch the living?
No, I don't believe it.
Sometimes I wonder if she doesn't come back here to Manderley, and watch you and Mr. de Winter together.
You look tired.
Why don't you stay here a while and rest?
And listen to the sea.
So soothing.
Listen to it.
Listen.
Listen to the sea.
Tell Mrs. Danvers I wish to see her immediately.
You sent for me, madam?
Yes, Mrs. Danvers.
I want you to get rid of all these things.
- These are Mrs. de Winter's things.
- I am Mrs. de Winter now.
Very well. I'll give the instructions.
Just a moment, please.
Mrs. Danvers, I intend to say nothing to Mr. de Winter about Mr. Favell's visit.
In fact, I prefer to forget everything that happened this afternoon.
Maxim, Maxim, you've been gone all day.
You're choking me.
Well, well, well, what have you been doing with yourself?
- I've been thinking.
- What did you want to do that for?
Come in here and I'll tell you.
Darling, could we have a costume ball just as you used to?
Now what put that into your mind?
Has Beatrice been at you?
No, no, but I feel that we ought to do something to make people feel that Manderley is just the same as it always was.
Oh, please, darling, could we?
You don't know what it would mean, you know.
You'd have to be hostess to hundreds of people, all the county.
And a lot of young people would come up from London,
- and turn the house into a nightclub.
- Oh, yes. But I want to. Please.
I've never been to a large party, but I could learn what to do.
And I promise you, you wouldn't be ashamed of me.
All right, if you think you'd enjoy it.
You'd better get Mrs. Danvers to help you out, won't you?
No, no. I don't need Mrs. Danvers to help me.
I can do it myself.
All right, my sweet.
Thank you, darling. Thank you.
- What'll you go as?
- I never dress up.
That's the one privilege I claim as the host.
What will you be? Alice in Wonderland, with that ribbon around your hair?
No, I won't tell you.
I'll design a costume all by myself and give you the surprise of your life.
Come in.
Robert found these sketches in the library, madam.
- Did you intend throwing them away?
- Yes, Mrs. Danvers, I did.
They were just some ideas I was sketching for my costume for the ball.
Hasn't Mr. de Winter suggested anything?
No, I want to surprise him.
I don't want him to know anything about it.
I merely thought that you might find a costume among the family portraits that would suit you.
Oh, you mean those at the top of the stairs?
I'll go and look at them.
This one, for instance.
Might have been designed for you.
I'm sure you could have it copied.
I've heard Mr. de Winter say that this is his favorite of all the paintings.
It's Lady Caroline de Winter, one of his ancestors.
Oh, well, that's a splendid idea, Mrs. Danvers.
I'm very grateful.
- Everything under control, Frith?
- Yes, sir, thank you.
Excuse me, sir, are you supposed to be a schoolmaster?
Oh, no. This is just my old cap and gown.
It certainly makes a very nice costume, sir.
And economical, too.
Yes. That was the idea.
Good evening, Robert.
Not very good weather for the ball.
- No, sir.
- Very misty on the way and very chilly.
Oh, this wig's so tight they ought to send an aspirin with it.
Hello. What's the idea? Adam and Eve?
Oh, Maxim, don't be disgusting.
- Strongman. Where's my weight thing?
- What thing?
You haven't left it in the car, have you?
There it is.
- You were the first one down?
- Yes.
Where's the child?
Well, she's keeping her costume a terrific secret.
Wouldn't even let me into her room.
Oh, lovely.
I'll go up and give her a hand.
- I could do with a drink.
- Won't you catch a cold in that thing?
Don't be silly. Pure wool, old boy.
- Pardon me, sir. You forgot this.
- Thank you.
Here I am, dear, it's Bea.
I've come to give you a hand.
Oh, please don't come in, Beatrice.
I don't want anyone to see my costume.
Oh. Oh, you won't be long, will you?
Because the first people will be arriving any moment.
Now, you're sure that's where that should be?
Yes, madam, it's just right.
- Isn't it exciting?
- Indeed it is, madam.
I've always heard of the Manderley ball, and now I'm really going to see one.
I'm sure there will be no one there to touch you, madam.
Do you really think so?
Now, where's my fan?
Here.
- You're sure I look all right?
- You look ever so beautiful.
Well, here goes.
Good evening, Mr. de Winter.
What the devil do you think you're doing?
Rebecca.
But it's the picture.
The one in the gallery.
- What is it? What have I done?
- Go and take it off.
It doesn't matter what you put on.
Anything will do.
What are you standing there for?
Didn't you hear what I said?
Sir George and Lady Moore.
Dudley Tennant. Admiral and Lady Burbank.
I watched you go down, just as I watched her a year ago.
Even in the same dress, you couldn't compare.
You knew it.
You knew that she wore it, and yet you deliberately suggested I wear it.
Why do you hate me? What have I done to you that you should ever hate me so?
You tried to take her place, you let him marry you.
I've seen his face, his eyes.
They're the same as those first weeks after she died.
I used to listen to him walking up and down, up and down, all night long, night after night, thinking of her, suffering torture because he'd lost her.
I don't want to know.
I don't want to know!
You thought you could be Mrs. de Winter, live in her house, walk in her steps, take the things that were hers.
But she's too strong for you.
You can't fight her.
No one ever got the better of her. Never. Never.
She was beaten in the end, but it wasn't a man, it wasn't a woman.
It was the sea.
Oh, stop it. Stop it. Oh, stop it.
You're overwrought, madam.
I've opened a window for you.
A little air will do you good.
Why don't you go?
Why don't you leave Manderley?
He doesn't need you.
He's got his memories.
He doesn't love you.
He wants to be alone again with her.
You've nothing to stay for.
You've nothing to live for, really, have you?
Look down there. It's easy, isn't it?
Why don't you? Why don't you?
Go on.
Go on.
Don't be afraid.
- Shipwreck.
- Ship on the rocks!
- A ship aground, sending up rockets!
- Shipwreck!
Come on, everybody, down to the bay.
- Notify the coast guard.
- She's aground.
Maxim! Maxim!
- Ship ashore.
- Come on! Come on, everybody.
- Come on! Come on!
- Maxim! Maxim!
Oh!
Ben, have you seen Mr. de Winter anywhere?
She won't come back, will she?
You said so.
Who, Ben? What do you mean?
The other one.
- Frank, have you seen Maxim anywhere?
- Not since about half an hour ago.
I thought he'd gone up to the house.
No, he hasn't been in the house at all, and I'm afraid something might have happened to him.
Frank, what's the matter?
Is anything wrong?
- There is something wrong.
- Well...
The diver who went down to inspect the bottom of the ship came across the hull of another boat.
A little sailboat.
- Frank, is it...
- Yes.
It's Rebecca's.
How did they recognize it?
He's a local man. Knew it instantly.
It'll be so hard on poor Maxim.
Yes. It's going to bring it all back again, and worse than before.
Why did they have to find it?
Why couldn't they have left it there in peace at the bottom of the sea?
Well, I'd better get along and arrange some breakfast for the men.
All right, Frank.
I'll go and look for Maxim.
- Hello.
- Maxim.
You haven't had any sleep.
- Have you forgiven me?
- Forgiven you?
What have I got to forgive you for?
For last night.
My stupidity about the costume.
Oh, that.
I'd forgotten.
I was angry with you, wasn't I?
Maxim, can't we start all over again?
I don't ask that you should love me.
I won't ask impossible things.
I'll be your friend, your companion.
I'll be happy with that.
You love me very much, don't you?
But it's too late, my darling.
We've lost our little chance of happiness.
- No, Maxim, no.
- Yes.
It's all over now.
The thing's happened.
The thing I have dreaded day after day.
- Night after night.
- Maxim, what are you trying to tell me?
Rebecca has won.
Her shadow has been between us all the time, keeping us from one another.
She knew that this would happen.
What are you saying?
They sent a diver down.
- He found another boat.
- Yes, I know. Frank told me.
Rebecca's boat. Oh, it's terrible for you.
I'm so sorry.
The diver made another discovery.
Broke one of the ports and looked into the cabin.
There was a body in there.
She wasn't alone.
There was someone sailing with her, and you have to find out who it was, that's it, isn't it, Maxim?
You don't understand.
There was no one with her.
It's Rebecca's body lying there on the cabin floor.
Oh, no.
The woman that was washed up at Edgecombe, the woman that is now buried in the family crypt, that was not Rebecca.
That was the body of some unknown woman, unclaimed, belonging nowhere.
I identified it.
But I knew it wasn't Rebecca.
It was all a lie.
I knew where Rebecca's body was, lying on that cabin floor on the bottom of the sea.
How did you know, Maxim?
Because I put it there.
Will you look into my eyes and tell me that you love me now?
You see? I was right.
It's too late.
No, it's not too late.
You're not to say that.
I love you more than anything in the world.
- Oh, please, Maxim, kiss me, please.
- No.
It's no use. It's too late.
Oh, we can't lose each other now.
We must be together always.
No secrets, no shadows.
We may only have a few days, a few hours.
Maxim, why didn't you tell me before?
I nearly did sometimes, but you never seemed close enough.
How could we be close when I knew you were always thinking of Rebecca?
How could I even ask you to love me, when I knew you loved Rebecca still?
What are you talking about?
What do you mean?
Whenever you touched me,
I knew you were comparing me with Rebecca.
Whenever you looked at me or spoke to me or walked with me in the garden,
I knew you were thinking,
"This I did with Rebecca, and this, and this."
Oh, it's true, isn't it?
You thought I loved Rebecca?
You thought that?
I hated her.
Oh, I was carried away by her, enchanted by her as everyone was.
And when I was married,
I was told I was the luckiest man in the world.
She was so lovely, so accomplished, so amusing.
"She's got the three things that really matter in a wife," everyone said.
"Breeding, brains and beauty."
And I believed them. Completely.
But I never had a moment's happiness with her.
She was incapable of love or tenderness or decency.
You didn't love her.
You didn't love her.
Do you remember that cliff where you first saw me in Monte Carlo?
Well, I went there with Rebecca on our honeymoon.
That's where I found out about her, four days after we were married.
She stood there laughing, her black hair blowing in the wind and told me all about herself.
Everything.
Things I'll never tell a living soul.
I wanted to kill her.
It would have been so easy.
You remember the precipice?
I frightened you, didn't I?
You thought I was mad.
Perhaps I was. Perhaps I am mad.
It wouldn't make for sanity, would it?
Living with the devil?
"I'll make a bargain with you," she said.
"You'd look rather foolish trying to divorce me now after four days of marriage, so I'll play the part of a devoted wife, mistress of your precious Manderley.
I'll make it the most famous showplace in England, if you like, and people will visit us and envy us, and say we're the luckiest, happiest couple in the country.
What a grand joke it'll be.
What a triumph."
I should never have accepted her dirty bargain, but I did.
I was younger then, and tremendously conscious of the family honor.
Family honor.
She knew that I'd sacrifice everything rather than stand up in a divorce court and give her away, admit that our marriage was a rotten fraud.
You despise me, don't you?
As I despise myself.
You can't understand what my feelings were, can you?
Of course I can, darling.
Of course I can.
Well, I kept the bargain and so did she, apparently.
Oh, she played the game brilliantly, but after a while, she began to grow careless.
She took a flat in London, and she'd stay away for days at a time.
Then she started to bring her friends down here.
I warned her, but she shrugged her shoulders.
"What's it got to do with you?" she said.
She even started on Frank.
Poor, faithful Frank.
Then there was a cousin of hers, a man named Favell.
Yes. I know him.
He came the day you went to London.
Why didn't you tell me?
I didn't like to.
I thought it would remind you of Rebecca.
Remind me?
As if I needed reminding.
Favell used to visit her here in this cottage.
I found out about it, and I warned her that if he came here again,
I'd shoot them both.
One night, when I found she had come back quietly from London,
I thought that Favell was with her, and I knew then that I couldn't stand this life of filth and deceit any longer.
I decided to come down here and have it out with both of them.
But she was alone.
She was expecting Favell, but he hadn't come.
She was lying on the divan, a large tray of cigarette stubs beside her.
She looked ill, queer.
Suddenly, she got up, started to walk toward me.
"When I have a child," she said,
"neither you nor anyone else could ever prove it wasn't yours.
You would like to have an heir, wouldn't you, Max, for your precious Manderley?"
Then she started to laugh.
"How funny.
How supremely, wonderfully funny.
I'll be the perfect mother, just as I've been the perfect wife.
No one will ever know.
It ought to give you the thrill of your life, Max, to watch my son grow bigger day by day and to know that when you die,
Manderley will be his."
She was face to face with me.
One hand in her pocket, the other holding a cigarette.
She was smiling.
"Well, Max?
What are you going to do about it?
Aren't you going to kill me?"
I suppose I went mad for a moment.
I must have struck her.
She stood staring at me.
She looked almost triumphant.
Then she started toward me again. Smiling.
Suddenly, she stumbled and fell.
When I looked down, ages afterwards, it seemed, she was lying on the floor.
She had struck her head on a heavy piece of ship's tackle.
I remember wondering why she was still smiling.
Then I realized she was dead.
But you didn't kill her.
It was an accident.
Who would believe me?
I lost my head.
I just knew I had to do something.
Anything.
I carried her out to the boat.
It was very dark. There was no moon.
I put her in the cabin.
When the boat seemed a safe distance from the shore, I took a spike, and drove it again and again through the planking of the hull.
I had opened up the seacocks and the water began to come in fast.
I climbed over into the dinghy and pulled away.
I saw the boat heel over and sink.
I pulled back into the cove.
It started raining.
- Maxim, does anyone else know of this?
- No. No one except you and me.
We must explain it.
It's got to be the body of someone you've never seen before.
No, they're bound to know her.
Her rings, bracelets she always wore.
They'll identify her body, then they'll remember the other woman.
The other woman buried in the crypt.
If they find out it was Rebecca, you must simply say you made a mistake about the other body.
That the day you went to Edgecombe, you were ill, you didn't know what you were doing.
Rebecca's dead. That's what we've got to remember. Rebecca's dead.
She can't speak. She can't bear witness.
She can't harm you anymore.
We're the only two people in the world that know, Maxim, you and I.
I'd told you once that I'd done a selfish thing in marrying you.
You can understand now what I meant.
I've loved you, my darling.
I shall always love you, but I've known all along that Rebecca would win in the end.
No, no. She hasn't won.
No matter what happens now, she hasn't won.
Hello?
Hello, Frank.
Hello, Frank. Yes.
Who? Colonel Julyan?
Yes. Tell him I'll meet him there as soon as I possibly can.
What?
Well...
Say we could talk about that when we're sure about the matter.
What's happened?
Colonel Julyan called.
He's the chief constable of the county.
He's been asked by the police to go to the mortuary.
He wanted to know if I could possibly have made a mistake about that other body.
Well, Colonel Julyan, apparently I did make a mistake about that other body.
The mistake was quite natural under the circumstances.
- Besides, you weren't well at the time.
- That's nonsense. I was perfectly well.
Don't let it worry you, Maxim.
Nobody can blame you for making a mistake.
The pity is, you've got to go through the same thing all over again.
What do you mean?
There'll have to be another inquest, of course.
Same formality and red tape.
Wish you could be spared the publicity of it, but I'm afraid that's impossible.
Oh, yes, publicity.
I suppose Mrs. de Winter went below for something and a squall hit the boat with nobody at the helm.
I imagine that's about the solution now, don't you think so, Crawley?
Oh, yes. Probably the door jammed, and she couldn't get on deck again.
Yeah.
Tabb, the boat builder, will undoubtedly come to some such conclusion.
Why, what would he know about it?
Well, he's examining the boat now.
Purely as a matter of routine, you know.
I'll be at the inquest tomorrow, Maxim, quite unofficially, you know.
We must get together for a game of golf when it's all over, eh?
Bye-bye.
I have the evening papers, madam.
Would you care to see them?
Oh, no thank you, Frith, and I prefer that Mr. de Winter weren't troubled with them, either.
I understand, madam. Permit me to say that we're all most distressed outside.
Thank you, Frith.
I'm afraid the news has been a great shock to Mrs. Danvers.
Yes, I rather expected it would be.
It seems there's to be a coroner's inquest, madam?
Yes, Frith. It's purely a formality.
Of course, madam. I...
I wanted to say that if any of us might be required to give evidence,
I should be only too pleased to do anything that might help the family.
Oh, thank you, Frith, why, I...
I'm sure Mr. de Winter will be very happy to hear it.
But I don't think anything will be necessary.
Maxim.
Hello, darling.
Oh, Maxim, I'm worried about what you'll do at the inquest tomorrow.
What do you mean?
You won't lose your temper, will you?
Promise me that they won't make you angry.
All right, darling. I promise.
No matter what he asks you, you won't lose your head?
Don't worry, dear.
They can't do anything at once, can they?
No.
Then we've a little time left to be together.
Yes.
- I want to go to the inquest with you.
- I'd rather you didn't, darling.
But I can't wait here alone.
I promise you,
I won't be any trouble to you.
And I must be near you so that no matter what happens, we won't be separated for a moment.
All right, dear.
I don't mind this whole thing except for you.
I can't forget what it's done to you.
I've been thinking of nothing else since it happened.
It's gone forever, that funny, young, lost look I loved.
It won't ever come back.
I killed that when I told you about Rebecca.
It's gone.
In a few hours, you've grown so much older.
Oh, Maxim, Maxim.
Black Jack Brady was his name.
The most important arrest I ever made.
It must have been about two years ago now.
Of course, there was no doubt about it.
He was hung a month after I caught him.
Hello. Wait a minute.
They've got old Balmy Ben up now.
You remember the late Mrs. de Winter, don't you?
- She's gone.
- Yes, we know that.
- She went in the sea. The sea got her.
- That's right. That's right.
Now we want you to tell us whether you were on the shore
- that last night she went sailing.
- Eh?
Were you on the shore that last night she went out, when she didn't come back?
I didn't see nothing.
I don't want to go to the asylum.
Them cruel folks there.
Now, nobody's going to send you to the asylum.
All we want you to do is tell us what you saw.
I didn't see nothing.
Come, come.
Did you see Mrs. de Winter get into her boat that last night?
I don't know nothing.
I don't want to go to the asylum.
Very well. You may go.
- Eh?
- You may go now.
- Mr. Tabb, step forward, please.
- Yes?
The evidence you give will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
I do, so help me God.
The late Mrs. de Winter used to send her boat
- to your shipyard for reconditioning.
- That's right, sir.
Can you remember any occasion when she had any sort of accident with the boat?
No, sir. I often said Mrs. de Winter was a born sailor.
Now, when Mrs. de Winter went below, as is supposed, and a sudden gust of wind came down, that would be enough to capsize the boat, wouldn't it?
Excuse me, sir.
But there's a little more to it than that.
- What do you mean, Mr. Tabb?
- I mean, sir, the seacocks.
What are the seacocks?
Sea...
The seacocks are the valves to drain out the boat.
They're always kept tight closed when you're afloat.
Yes?
Well, yesterday, when I examined that boat,
I found they'd been opened.
What could be the reason for that?
Just this, that's what flooded the boat and sunk her.
Are you implying that boat never capsized at all?
I know it's a terrible thing to say, sir, but in my opinion, she was scuttled.
- And there's them holes.
- What holes?
- In her planking.
- What are you talking about?
Of course, that boat's been underwater for over a year, and the tide's been knocking her against the ridge.
But it seemed to me them holes looked as if she'd made them from the inside.
Then you believe she must have done it deliberately.
Couldn't have been no accident, not with her knowledge of boats.
You knew the former Mrs. de Winter very well, I believe?
Oh, yes.
Would you have believed her capable of suicide?
No. Frankly, I would not.
But you never can tell.
You may stand down, Mr. Tabb.
Mr. de Winter, please.
Sorry to drag you back for further questioning, Mr. de Winter.
But you've heard the statement of Mr. Tabb.
I wonder if you can help us in any way.
I'm afraid not.
Can you think of any reason why there should be holes in the planking of the late
Mrs. de Winter's boat?
Well, of course I can't think of any reason.
Has anyone ever discussed these holes with you before?
Well, since the boat has been at the bottom of the ocean,
I scarcely think that likely.
Mr. de Winter, I want you to believe we all feel very deeply for you in this matter.
But you must remember that I don't conduct this inquiry for my own amusement.
- That's rather obvious, isn't it?
- I hope that it is.
Well, since she went sailing alone, are we to believe that she drove those holes herself?
You may believe what you like.
Can you enlighten us as to why
Mrs. de Winter should have wanted to end her own life?
I know of no reason whatever.
Mr. de Winter, however painful it may be,
I have to ask you a very personal question.
Were relations between you and the late
Mrs. de Winter perfectly happy?
Were relations between you and the late
Mrs. de Winter perfectly happy?
I won't stand this any longer!
You might as well know now...
We'll adjourn till after lunch.
Mr. de Winter, I presume you'll be available for us then?
I told you, you should have had some breakfast.
You're hungry.
That's what's the matter with you.
Mr. Frith thought you might like to have some lunch from the house, and sent me with it.
No, that's fine.
Pull around the corner.
Very good, sir.
Awfully foolish of me, fainting like that.
Nonsense. If you hadn't fainted like that,
I'd have really lost my temper.
Darling, please be careful.
Darling, wait here a few moments.
I'll see if I can find old Frank.
Of course, darling.
Don't worry about me. I'll be all right.
Sure?
Here, try a spot of this. Do you good.
Thank you.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, of course.
- I won't be long.
- Right you are.
Hello.
And how does the bride find herself today?
I say, marriage with Max is not exactly a bed of roses, is it?
I think you'd better go before Maxim gets back.
Oh, jealous, is he?
Well, I can't say I blame him.
But you don't think
I'm the big bad wolf, do you?
I'm not, you know.
I'm a perfectly ordinary, harmless bloke.
And I think you're behaving splendidly over all this. Perfectly splendidly.
You know, you've grown up a bit since I last saw you. It's no wonder...
What do you want, Favell?
Oh, hello, Max. Things are going pretty well for you, aren't they?
Better than you ever expected.
I was rather worried about you at first.
That's why I came down to the inquest.
Well, I'm touched by your solicitude.
But if you don't mind, we'd rather like to have our lunch.
Lunch? I say, what a jolly idea.
Rather like a picnic, isn't it?
I'm so sorry.
Do you mind if I put this there?
You know, Max, old boy, I really think
I ought to talk things over with you.
Talk what things over?
Well, those holes in the planking, for one thing.
Those holes that were drilled from the inside.
- Oh, Mullen?
- Yes, sir?
Would you, like a good fellow, have my car filled with petrol?
- It's almost empty.
- Very good, sir.
- And, Mullen, close the door, will you?
- Yes, sir.
Does this bother you?
You know, old boy, I have a strong feeling that before the day's out, somebody's going to make use of that rather expressive, though somewhat old-fashioned term,
"foul play."
Am I boring you with all this?
No?
Good. Well, you see, Max,
I find myself in a rather awkward position.
You've only got to read this note to understand.
It's from Rebecca.
And, what's more, she had the foresight to put a date on it.
She wrote me the day she died.
Incidentally, I was at a party on that night so I didn't get it until the next day.
And what makes you think that note would interest me?
Oh, I'm not gonna bother you with the contents now.
But I can assure you that it is not the note of a woman who intends to drown herself that same night.
By the way, what do you do with old bones?
Bury them?
However, for the time being...
You know, Max, I'm getting fed up with my job as a motorcar salesman.
I don't know if you've ever experienced the feeling of driving an expensive motorcar which isn't your own?
But it can be very, very exasperating.
You know what I mean.
You want to own the car yourself.
I often wonder what it would be like to retire to the country.
Have a nice little place with a few acres of shooting.
I've never figured out what it would cost a year, but I'd like to talk about it with you.
I'd like to have your advice on how to live comfortably without hard work.
Hello, Favell.
You looking for me, Maxim?
Yes.
Mr. Favell and I have a little business transaction on hand.
I think we had better conduct it over at the inn.
They may have a private room there.
Well, see you later.
Find Colonel Julyan.
Tell him I want to see him immediately.
Come on, Favell. Let's go.
- Have you a private room, please?
- Of course, sir. Through there, sir.
Hope this will do, Mr. de Winter.
Splendid. Splendid.
Exactly like the Ritz.
Any orders, gents?
Yes. You might bring me a large brandy and soda.
How about you, Max? Have one on me.
I feel I can afford to play host.
Thanks. I don't mind if I do.
Make it two, will you, like a good fellow?
- Very good, sir.
- Where's Mr. de Winter?
Through the other door, sir.
Colonel Julyan, this is Mr. Favell.
Oh, I know Colonel Julyan.
We're old friends, aren't we?
Since you're old friends,
I assume you also know he's head of the police here.
He might be interested to hear your proposition.
Go on, tell him all about it.
I don't know what you mean. I merely said I hoped to give up selling cars and retire into the country.
Actually, he offered to withhold a vital piece of evidence from the inquest if I made it worth his while.
I only want to see justice done, Colonel.
Now, that boat builder's evidence suggested certain possible theories concerning Rebecca's death.
One of them, of course, is suicide.
Now I have a little note here which I consider puts that possibility quite out of court.
Read it, Colonel.
"Jack, darling,
I've just seen the doctor and I'm going down to Manderley right away.
I shall be at the cottage all this evening and shall leave the door open for you.
I have something terribly important to tell you.
Rebecca."
Now, does that look like the note of a woman who had made up her mind to kill herself?
And apart from that, do you mean to tell me that if you wanted to commit suicide, you would go to all the trouble of putting out to sea in a boat, and then take a hammer and chisel and laboriously knock holes through the bottom of it?
Come, Colonel. As an officer of the law, don't you feel there are some slight grounds for suspicion?
- Of murder?
- What else?
You've known Max a long time.
So you know he's the old-fashioned type, who'd die to defend his honor, or who'd kill for it.
It's blackmail, pure and simple.
Blackmail is not so pure, nor so simple.
It can bring a lot of trouble to a great many people.
And the blackmailer sometimes finds himself in jail at the end of it.
Oh, I see. You're going to hold de Winter's hand through all this.
Just because he's the big noise around here and he's actually permitted you to dine with him.
Be careful, Favell.
You've brought an accusation of murder.
- Have you any witnesses?
- I do have a witness.
It's that fellow, Ben.
If that stupid coroner hadn't been as much of a snob as you are, he'd have seen that half-wit was hiding something.
And why should Ben do that?
Because we caught him once,
Rebecca and I, peering at us through the cottage window.
Rebecca threatened him with the asylum.
That's why he was afraid to speak.
But he was always hanging about.
He must have seen this whole thing.
It's ridiculous, even listening to all this.
You're like a little trade union, all of you, aren't you?
And if my guess is right, Crawley, there's a bit of malice in your soul toward me, isn't there?
Crawley didn't have much success with Rebecca, but he ought to have more luck this time.
And the bride will be grateful for your fraternal arm, Crawley, in a week or so.
Every time she faints, in fact.
- De Winter!
- Maxim, please!
That temper of yours will do you in yet, Max.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
- Now is there anything else?
- Yes.
You might bring Mr. de Winter a sedative.
- No, no. Nothing at all. Just leave us.
- Very good.
Now, Favell, let's get this business over.
As you seem to have worked out the whole thing so carefully, perhaps you can provide us also with a motive.
I knew you were going to bring that up, Colonel.
I've read enough detective stories to know that there must always be a motive.
And if you'll all excuse me,
I might supply that, too.
I wish you'd go home.
You ought not to be here through all this.
Please let me stay, Maxim.
Surely, Colonel Julyan, you're not going to allow this fellow to...
My opinion of Favell is no higher than yours, Crawley.
But in my official capacity,
I have no alternative but to pursue his accusations.
I entirely agree with you, Colonel.
In matters as serious as this, we must make sure of every point and explore every avenue.
And in fact, if I may coin a phrase, leave no stone unturned.
Here she is, the missing link, the witness who will help supply the motive.
Colonel Julyan, Mrs. Danvers.
I believe you know everyone else.
Won't you sit down?
No offense, Colonel, but I think I'll put this to Danny.
She'll understand it more easily.
Danny, who was Rebecca's doctor?
Mrs. de Winter always had Dr. McClean from the village.
Now, you heard.
I said Rebecca's doctor in London.
I don't know anything about that.
Oh, don't give me that, Danny.
You knew everything about Rebecca.
You knew she was in love with me, didn't you?
Surely you haven't forgotten the good times she and I used to have down at the cottage on the beach.
She had a right to amuse herself, didn't she?
Love was a game to her. Only a game.
It made her laugh, I tell you.
She used to sit and rock with laughter at the lot of you.
Can you think of why Mrs. de Winter should have taken her own life?
No, no. I refuse to believe it.
I knew everything about her and I won't believe it.
There. You see? It's impossible.
She knows that as well as I do.
Now, listen to me, Danny.
We know that Rebecca went to a doctor in London on the last day of her life. Who was it?
I don't know.
I understand, Danny.
You think we're asking you to reveal secrets of Rebecca's life.
You're trying to defend her.
But that's what I'm doing.
I'm trying to clear her name of the suspicion of suicide.
Mrs. Danvers, it has been suggested that Mrs. de Winter was deliberately murdered.
There you have it in a nutshell, Danny.
But there's one more thing you'll want to know, the name of the murderer.
It's a lovely name that rolls off the tongue so easily.
George Fortescue Maximilian de Winter.
There was a doctor.
Mrs. de Winter sometimes went to him privately.
She used to go to him even before she was married.
We don't want reminiscences, Danny.
What was his name?
Dr. Baker.
165 Goldhawk Road, Shepherd's Bush.
There you are, Colonel.
There's where you'll find your motive.
Go and question Dr. Baker.
He'll tell you why Rebecca went to him.
To confirm the fact that she was going to have a child.
A sweet, curly-headed little child.
It isn't true. It isn't true.
She would have told me.
She told Max about it.
Max knew he wasn't the father.
So, like the gentleman of the old school that he is, he killed her.
I'm afraid we shall have to question this Dr. Baker.
Hear, hear. But for safety's sake,
I think I'd like to go along, too.
Yes. Unfortunately, I suppose you have the right to ask that.
I'll see the coroner and have the inquest postponed pending further evidence.
I say, aren't you rather afraid that the prisoner, shall we say, might bolt?
You have my word for it that he will not do that.
Toodle-oo, Max. Come along, Danny.
Let's leave the unhappy couple to spend their last moments together alone.
Are you sure you don't want me to go with you, Max?
No, darling.
It'll be very tiring for you.
I'll be back the very first thing in the morning.
- And I won't even stop to sleep.
- I'll be waiting for you.
- Ready, Maxim?
- Yes.
You two go on ahead.
I'll follow with Favell.
Dr. Baker, you may have seen
Mr. de Winter's name in the papers recently.
Yes. Yes. In connection with the body that was found in a boat.
My wife was reading all about it.
A very sad case. My condolences.
This is going to take hours.
Let me...
Don't bother, Favell.
I think I can tell Dr. Baker.
We're trying to discover certain facts concerning the late Mrs. de Winter's activities on the day of her death.
October the 12th, last year.
I want you to tell me if you can, if anyone of that name paid you a visit on that date?
I'm awfully sorry.
I'm afraid I can't help you.
I should have remembered the name de Winter.
I've never attended a Mrs. de Winter in my life.
How can you possibly tell all your patients' names?
I can look it up in my engagement diary if you like.
- Did you say the 12th of October?
- Yes.
Here we are.
No. No de Winter.
Are you sure?
Well, here are all the appointments for that day.
Ross, Campbell, Steadall, Perrino, Danvers...
- Danny? What the devil?
- Would you read that name again?
Did you say Danvers?
Yes. I have a Mrs. Danvers for 3:00.
What did she look like?
Can you remember?
Yes, I remember her quite well.
She was a very beautiful woman.
- Tall, dark, exquisitely dressed.
- Rebecca.
The lady must have used an assumed name.
Is that so?
This is a surprise.
I've known her a long time.
What was the matter with her?
Well, there are certain ethics.
Could you supply a reason, Dr. Baker, for Mrs. de Winter's suicide?
For her murder, you mean?
She was going to have a kid, wasn't she?
Come on. Out with it!
Tell me, what else would a woman of her class be doing in a dump like this?
I take it the official nature of this visit makes it necessary for me to...
I assure you we'd not be troubling you if it were not necessary.
You want to know if I can suggest any motive as to why Mrs. de Winter should have taken her life?
Yes, I think I can.
The woman who called herself Mrs. Danvers was very seriously ill.
She was not going to have a child?
That was what she thought.
My diagnosis was different.
I sent her to a well-known specialist for an examination and x-rays.
And on this date, she returned to me for his report.
I remember her standing here holding out her hand for the photograph.
"I want to know the truth," she said.
"I don't want soft words and a bedside manner.
If I'm for it, you can tell me right away."
I knew she was not the type to accept a lie.
She'd asked for the truth, so I let her have it.
She thanked me.
I never saw her again, so I assumed...
- What was wrong with her?
- Cancer.
Yes, the growth was deep-rooted.
An operation would have been no earthly use at all.
In a short time, she would have been under morphia.
There was nothing that could be done for her, except wait.
Did she say anything when you told her?
She smiled in a queer sort of way.
Your wife was a wonderful woman, Mr. de Winter.
And, oh, yes, I remember she said something that struck me as being very peculiar at the time.
When I told her it was a matter of months, she said,
"Oh, no, Doctor, not that long."
You've been very kind.
You've told us all we wanted to know.
We shall probably need an official verification.
- Verification?
- Yes.
- To confirm the verdict of suicide.
- I understand.
Can I offer you gentlemen a glass of sherry?
No, that's very kind.
I think we ought to be going.
Thank heaven we know the truth.
Dreadful thing. Dreadful.
Young and lovely woman like that.
No wonder...
I never had the remotest idea.
Neither did Danny, I'm sure.
I wish I had a drink.
Will we be needed at the inquest any further, Colonel Julyan?
No, no. I can see to it that Maxim's not troubled any further.
- Thank you, sir.
- You ready to start, Colonel?
No, thank you.
I'm staying in town tonight.
And let me tell you, Favell, blackmail is not much of a profession.
And we know how to deal with it in our part of the world, strange as it may seem to you.
I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about.
But if you ever need a new car, Colonel, just let me know.
It's impossible to thank you for your kindness to us through all this.
You know what I feel without my saying it.
Not at all.
Put the whole thing behind you.
But let your wife know.
She'll be getting worried.
Yes, of course.
I'll phone her at once and we'll get straight down to Manderley.
Goodbye, Crawley.
Maxim's got a great friend.
- Frank.
- Yes, Maxim?
- There's something you don't know.
- Oh, no, there isn't.
I didn't kill her, Frank.
But I know now that when she told me about the child, she wanted me to kill her.
She lied on purpose.
She foresaw the whole thing.
That's why she stood there laughing when she...
Don't think about it anymore.
Thank you, Frank.
Hello, Danny.
I just wanted to tell you the news.
Rebecca held out on both of us.
She had cancer.
Yes, suicide.
Now Max and that dear little bride of his will be able to stay on at Manderley and live happily ever after.
Bye-bye, Danny.
- This your car, sir?
- Yes.
Will you be going soon?
This isn't a parking place, you know.
Oh, isn't it? Well, people are entitled to leave cars outside if they want to.
It's a pity some of you fellows haven't anything better to do.
When you phoned, did she say she'd wait up?
I asked her to go to bed, but she wouldn't hear of it.
I wish I could get some more speed out of this thing.
Is something worrying you, Maxim?
I can't get over the feeling something's wrong.
- Frank.
- What's the matter? Why did we stop?
What's the time?
Well, this clock's wrong.
It must be 3:00 or 4:00. Why?
That can't be the dawn breaking over there.
It's in the winter that you see the northern lights, isn't it?
That's not the northern lights.
That's Manderley.
Frith! Frith!
Mrs. de Winter. Where is she?
- I thought I saw her, sir.
- Where?
Maxim!
Thank heavens you've come back to me!
- Are you all right, darling?
- Oh, yes, I am.
Are you all right?
Mrs. Danvers, she's gone mad.
She said she'd rather destroy Manderley than see us happy here.

{6727}{6784}Mrs Jefferson's had her baby.
{6786}{6882}The stagecoach run from here|to Sudrow Wells has been halted.
{6884}{6972}There's a despatch rider|from Paradise River patrol -

{7069}{7120}A boy or a girl?
{7123}{7204}(COUGHS) It's a little trooper, sir.

{7603}{7698}Would have made corporal|in five or six years.

{13154}{13260}That's very true, sir. But look|at the clan mark on this arrow.
{13262}{13324}It's the sign of the dog.
{13326}{13413}It's from the bow of a|Southern Cheyenne dog soldier.
{13416}{13512}What would the Cheyenne|be doing this far south?
{13514}{13581}That's isn't my department, sir.

{16477}{16559}- Picnicking, sir.|- Picnicking?
{16582}{16678}Picnicking, Miss Dandridge?|Where? In St. Louis?
{16681}{16734}No, by the waterfall. I'm sorry -
{16736}{16822}Never apologise, mister,|it's a sign of weakness.
{16824}{16955}Mr Cohill, I see no reason why Mr|Pennell should not go picnicking.
{16990}{17015}Very good, sir.
{17080}{17126}Thank you, Captain Brittles.
{17130}{17234}But, Miss Dandridge, Mr Cohill|was right to stop you going out,
{17236}{17293}under the present emergency.
{17295}{17367}So, may I escort you to your quarters?
{17397}{17492}You may proceed with|your picnic, Mr Pennell.

{19529}{19584}Keogh...
{19586}{19638}Miles Keogh?
{20745}{20842}Well, Mary, only six more days to go,
{20845}{20954}and your old Nathan|will be out of the army.
{21011}{21094}I haven't decided what I'll do yet.
{21132}{21281}Somehow I just can't picture myself|back there on the banks of the Wabash,
{21283}{21340}rocking on the front porch.
{21365}{21478}Well, I've been thinking|I'll maybe push on west.
{21528}{21586}New settlements. California.
{21637}{21720}We had some sad news today, Mary.
{21722}{21813}George Custer was killed|and his whole command.
{21815}{21921}Miles Keogh among them.|You remember Miles.
{21924}{21993}Happy-go-lucky|Irishman...
{22020}{22088}who used to waltz so well with you.
{22114}{22207}Yeah, I know, I guess|I was a little jealous.
{22243}{22301}Never could waltz, myself.
{22335}{22462}Well, I'll take a trip out in the morning|- Cheyennes are around.
{22482}{22605}I'm gonna pick up the patrols|and drive them back north.
{22633}{22707}Probably be my last mission, Mary.
{22722}{22784}Hard to believe, isn't it?
{22839}{22891}Hard to believe.
{23505}{23582}I hope I'm not intruding, Captain,
{23584}{23705}but I've watched you come|out here to your family and...
{23708}{23755}So, I...
{23758}{23813}So, I brought you this.
{23815}{23854}Well...
{23856}{23914}I appreciate this very much.
{23916}{24028}It's called Cyclamen. It's a Greek|word. It means 'rabbit's ears.'
{24030}{24175}My wife called them Flaming Arrows.|She was... she was fond of gardening.
{24208}{24324}I'm sorry I made such a fool of|myself at the gate this morning.
{24326}{24393}You made a fool out of|two young lieutenants.
{24395}{24451}That's never against the rules.
{24454}{24537}- Then I'm forgiven?|- Ah! Forgiven!
{24556}{24641}Well, goodnight, Captain.
{24658}{24765}Goodnight, miss. Thank you.
{25093}{25146}She's a nice girl.

{25854}{25892}- Five more.|- Three more.
{25893}{25931}- Five more!|- Three more!
{25933}{26034}- Five! Can't you count?|- Three weeks before I retire, sir.
{26036}{26171}Oh. Days, weeks, what's the difference?|Are you going to stand there all morning?

{27119}{27226}- There's no wagon goes on this patrol.|- Orders, sir.
{27276}{27336}- Orders, huh?|- Yes, sir.
{27339}{27373}Huh.
{27436}{27488}Morning, sir.
{27593}{27654}- Side-saddle,|Riley? - Yes, sir.
{27656}{27690}Ya!
{27749}{27839}Side-saddle! Major|Allshard, what in blazes -
{27842}{27894}Hold it! I know|- the wagon.
{27896}{27967}Yes, a wagon full of women's junk.
{27969}{28061}I can't hamper this|patrol with a wagon.
{28064}{28197}I'm sending my wife and her niece|with you, as far as Sudrow's Wells,
{28198}{28245}where they'll take the stage.
{28247}{28327}- That is an order, Captain.|- I protest.
{28328}{28424}- I expected you to. Put it in writing.|- I intend to.
{28444}{28499}I sat up half the night with this.
{28524}{28628}I can't keep the Dandridge girl here|- she ain't army.
{28630}{28682}Yes, for these reasons...
{28685}{28743}- Coffee?|- One... No. Yes!
{28778}{28899}There's a party of Cheyenne dog|soldiers raiding this territory.
{28901}{28936}I think -
{28938}{29016}- How many Rs in territory?|- Two.
{29302}{29416}Men, I want you to pay strict|attention to what I say.
{29444}{29523}There's gonna be|women with this column,
{29525}{29597}and I want you men|to watch them words.
{29599}{29633}Watch them words!
{29635}{29687}Watch them grammar!
{29969}{30021}Whose dog is this?
{30039}{30093}Whose dog is this?
{30169}{30226}Nice dog. Irish setter.
{30260}{30358}Poor Abby says everyone will|think she's running away.
{30360}{30457}It's gonna be tough on me|- I'll be a bachelor all winter.
{30460}{30611}And in conclusion, I respectfully protest|the decision of my commanding officer,
{30637}{30760}to saddle this troop with|his female relations...
{30762}{30839}- One L.|- In this critical hour.
{30841}{30958}Signed Nathan|Brittles... and so forth.
{30961}{31050}Sounds very good, Nathan.|Give it to me, I'll file it.
{31053}{31102}- Hochbauer!|- Yes, sir.
{31104}{31209}I know this is a hard decision|for you. Gonna miss Abby.
{31211}{31307}I hate to hamstring you,|but you will be careful?
{31309}{31357}- Mac!|- Oh, forget it.
{31359}{31464}As you were, Hochbauer.|Well, here I am, all ready.
{31466}{31577}How did Nathan take the idea|of old iron-pants riding along?
{31579}{31685}- Under protest, my dear.|- Written protest, Abby, of course.
{31687}{31785}It's always my pleasure|to escort old iron-pants.
{31787}{31852}Well, as long as you're going -
{31854}{31982}That is the damn blastedest outfit|ever! Quincannon's old breeches.
{31984}{32027}Yes.
{32154}{32242}- Morning, Mr Cohill.|- Morning.
{32245}{32352}- I hope you approve of my uniform.|- Yes, indeed.
{32376}{32428}It's very lovely, Olivia.
{32475}{32570}So, Ross has branded you|with his yellow ribbon?
{32593}{32666}How do you know it|isn't for you, mister?
{32682}{32817}I'd be very happy if I thought|it were for me. Very happy indeed.
{32821}{32915}- Good morning!|- Trooper Dandridge reporting, sir.
{32916}{33037}Well, a proper trooper! Right|pretty, don't you think, Mr Cohill?
{33040}{33074}Yes, sir.
{33076}{33158}A yellow ribbon. Do you know|what that means in the cavalry?
{33161}{33215}- A sweetheart.|- It does?
{33217}{33317}- Who's it for?|- For you of course, Captain Brittles.
{33319}{33403}For me! I'll make these|young bucks jealous.
{33536}{33570}Good morning, Flint.
{33572}{33674}You look nice. I hope Ross|notices that yellow ribbon.
{33896}{33989}I hope you're wearing|that yellow ribbon for me.
{33992}{34064}Who else would I be wearing it for?
{35077}{35116}Right, by twos.
{35118}{35154}Yo!
{35168}{35204}MUSIC: Round her neck
{35206}{35259}She wore a yellow ribbon
{35262}{35297}She wore it in the winter
{35299}{35362}And the merry month of May
{35364}{35409}When I asked her
{35410}{35453}'Why the yellow ribbon?"
{35455}{35491}She said, "It's for my lover
{35493}{35542}who is in the cavalry."
{35545}{35593}Cavalry!
{35596}{35650}Cavalry!
{35651}{35692}She said, "It's for my lover,
{35695}{35741}who is in the cavalry."
{35742}{35791}Cavalry!
{35792}{35842}Cavalry!
{35843}{35889}She said, "It's for my lover,
{35892}{35946}in the US cavalry." END
{38087}{38121}Report.
{38123}{38198}I trailed Mr Rynders buckboard, sir.
{38201}{38317}About a mile below the painted|pole, he met two men in a wagon.
{38318}{38436}- Do you know who they were?|- No, it didn't seem prudent to inquire.
{38464}{38527}Why do you think they're so far south?
{38529}{38613}Well, that ain't my department.
{38614}{38678}We'll probably pick them|up on the next go round.
{38692}{38736}- Take the point.|- Yes, sir.
{39768}{39843}- Sergeant?|- Yes, sir?
{39861}{39913}Ride through that pass.
{40389}{40457}Romantic, isn't it, Miss Dandridge?
{40460}{40508}Guidons gaily fluttering,
{40510}{40569}bronzed men lustily singing,
{40571}{40620}horses prancing,
{40622}{40664}bunions aching.
{40666}{40747}Must you always be|so vulgar, Mr Cohill?
{40748}{40809}The cavalry doesn't|go in for refinements.
{40811}{40945}Cavalry! Silly business of dismounting|and walking every hour or so.
{40948}{41070}- It's like being in the infantry.|- We would be, if tired out our mounts.
{41073}{41135}You could ride in the wagon.
{41137}{41200}Army wagons don't have springs.
{41202}{41270}The men would rather|have finger bowls.
{41272}{41330}I think that's terribly|funny, Mr Cohill -
{41332}{41377}...greens and milk.
{41379}{41424}Oh, the army!
{41426}{41539}I planted 24 gardens, the|first 10 years of our marriage.
{41541}{41635}We never stayed long enough|to see a single bloom.
{41639}{41771}Could I ride back along the line? I'd|rather share the dust with Mr Pennell.
{41773}{41864}You've already thrown|enough dust in his eyes!
{41873}{41971}Mr Cohill, relieve Mr|Pennell of the rear guard.
{41975}{42020}Yes, Sir!
{42262}{42311}Are you enjoying your walk, darlin'?
{42314}{42395}Oh, yes. Yes, I am.
{42654}{42706}Yo!
{42754}{42806}Hold!
{43363}{43457}Can you make em out?|They look like Arapaho.
{43458}{43556}They're moving the whole village|- wagons, lodges, and all.
{44188}{44241}Well...
{44243}{44389}I don't know where you got your brains,|but God must have given you those eyes.
{44391}{44495}They're Arapahos alright|- heading the same way we are.
{44669}{44796}Now, why would they be moving on|Sudrow's Wells? Answer me that.
{44799}{44936}My mother didn't raise her sons to make|guesses in front of yankee captains.
{44962}{45036}Well, I'd soon find out if...
{45038}{45111}Oh, I can't risk it with those women.
{45113}{45162}- Officers' call.|- Yes, sir.
{45739}{45842}- Are those hostile indians?|- Rejoin the column.
{45858}{45942}- Captain Brittles!|- Get back in line.
{46074}{46154}I don't like it, Mr Cohill,|I don't like it at all.
{46157}{46191}Arapahos?
{46193}{46265}We're giving them a wide berth.
{46267}{46366}- Go through Twin Forks.|- But we'll lose half a day!
{46368}{46418}The ladies may miss the stage.
{46421}{46489}Would you rather they|missed their scalps?
{46492}{46557}- Take the column, Mr Cohill.|- Yes, Sir.
{46559}{46606}- I'm sorry -|- Oh, shut up!
{47366}{47442}You're relieved, Mr|Cohill. I'm taking over.
{47445}{47538}The old man hasn't spoken|to me in three hours.
{47541}{47598}The ladies may miss the stage.
{47600}{47684}You'll be lucky if he|talks to you in three days.
{47687}{47754}- It'll be his last chance to.|- Yeah?
{47755}{47814}So, you're still going to resign?
{47817}{47888}- Through channels.|- As adjudant, I'll tear it up!
{47890}{48025}Every second lieutenant can resign three|times during his first tour of duty.
{48026}{48111}You forget I don't have|to depend on cavalry pay.
{48113}{48194}That's right, I had|forgotten your silver spoon.
{48197}{48281}But I bet Miss Olivia|Dandridge hasn't!
{48283}{48348}Do you want to pull your blouse?
{48351}{48423}Hold your coat, Lieutenant Pennell.
{48543}{48646}Why don't you let Ross Pennell|go? He could be a fine officer.
{48648}{48745}- You're not his guardian -|nor am I. - I'll say it anyway.
{48747}{48833}Ross is a spoilt, rich kid.|The army's his only hope.
{48835}{48896}So, if you can't take it, let him be!
{49844}{49897}Buffalo!
{49927}{49992}- Buffalo, Mr Cohill.|- Yes, sir.
{50017}{50150}First time the herd's been this|far north since... summer of '68.
{50184}{50263}- You never saw a buffalo, Mr Pennell?|- No, sir.
{50264}{50304}Oh.
{50306}{50359}Before your time.
{50380}{50432}Sergeant, Quincannon!
{50435}{50510}Escort the ladies forward, please.
{50998}{51064}Aunt Abbey, that's really buffalo!
{51065}{51114}Yes, buffalo.
{51116}{51178}Aye, that's a lot of buffalo.
{51180}{51310}It reminds me of the old days|- when whisky was 50 cents a gallon.
{51336}{51445}- Sure hanker for some buffalo meat.|- I ain't never had none.
{51447}{51494}Beans is safer!
{51497}{51637}You mark my word, there'll be indians|around that herd thicker than flies.
{51641}{51764}What's your thinking? And don't|tell me it ain't your department.
{51766}{51893}Well, Captain, I ain't getting paid|for thinking. I read it this way.
{51894}{51981}If I was a young,|hot-blood, like Red Shirt,
{51983}{52093}anxious to show off in front|of them Cheyenne dog soldiers,
{52095}{52147}I'd be down at the counsel fire,
{52149}{52271}telling them I made the medicine|that brought back the buffalo.
{52297}{52360}I'd tell them about the Great Spirit.
{52362}{52490}How us Indians should all stick together|- quit quarrelling.
{52497}{52557}Join our Cheyenne brothers,
{52559}{52684}who took General Custer and drove|out the rest of the yankee soldiers.
{52686}{52739}That's what I'd tell 'em.
{52758}{52827}Of course, I'm just guessing, Captain.
{52829}{52868}Well...
{52870}{52955}Of course, I'm just|guessing too, Sergeant.
{52970}{53095}But if I was an indian|agent, maybe named Mr Rynders,
{53097}{53207}and I'd met a couple of men|who might be gun-runners,
{53208}{53327}I'm guessing I'd be mighty close|to that counsel fire of Red Shirt's,
{53328}{53432}ready to do a land office|business in repeating rifles.
{53445}{53508}Well, why don't we take the whole -
{53510}{53579}Miss Dandridge and her chaperone.
{53582}{53674}Keep it up! That's all|I ask! Just keep it up!
{53698}{53820}Sergeant, make for the Paradise|River. Pick up our patrol there.
{53822}{53920}Go to Sudrow's Wells and hold|the stagecoach for the ladies.
{53924}{54007}- Yes, sir!|- Tell them I've been delayed.
{54010}{54052}- Take the column, Mr Cohill.|- Yes, sir.
{54884}{54937}Ho-oh!
{54948}{55000}Ladies to the rear!
{55058}{55112}Mr Cohill?
{55114}{55153}Ya!

{57644}{57696}WHOOPING

{57824}{57884}Shoot over their heads.
{58733}{58785}Help him up. Men?
{58844}{58951}Corporal Quayne, sir, reporting|with Paradise River patrol.
{58969}{59092}- Arapahos jumped us at sundown.|- It was Red Shirt himself, Captain!
{59093}{59183}Shut up, McCarthy! Quiet|while I'm making this report!
{59185}{59238}Easy, Mike, easy.
{59280}{59342}They had us ringed at night.
{59364}{59417}We got away.
{59434}{59545}Made it to the relief point,|but you weren't there, Sir.
{59569}{59664}I wanted to be there,|Corporal. Proceed.
{59696}{59783}They flushed us at dawn, Sir,
{59785}{59832}and I got this.
{59902}{59959}That's a good, clear report.
{59961}{60013}It'll show on your record.
{60015}{60085}You'll get that extra stripe.
{60088}{60130}Thank you, Sir.
{60132}{60184}Sound for the wagon.
{60207}{60254}Easy, fella.
{60325}{60398}Good work, McCarthy. Good work, men!
{60400}{60506}You'll get you some whisky,|Quayne. You'll be alright.
{60751}{60802}Halt!
{60834}{60901}- What's happened?|- Quayne's hurt.
{61591}{61643}Cheyennes, laddie.
{61660}{61771}Same ones that killed them yankee|soldiers with General Custer.
{61775}{61823}WHOOPING
{63956}{64021}Easy, boy. Let's go.
{64510}{64627}The arrow head's right over|Quayne's heart. It's got to come out.
{64629}{64703}It's a risky operation. Can you halt?
{64706}{64757}You know I can't.
{64760}{64846}For 30 minutes, 20|minutes. For a man's life -
{64848}{64941}I couldn't give you five|minutes if it were my own son.
{64943}{65020}Quayne will have to|take a soldier's risks.
{65023}{65099}He knows that. I'm|the one who's begging.
{65102}{65214}I'll give you all I can.|Troop halt! Dismount leads.
{65216}{65263}Thank you, Nathan.
{65265}{65324}Hold your cap in the ranks.

{69517}{69583}Forward ho!
{69741}{69793}Thanks, soldier.
{70149}{70201}I'm so happy about Corporal Quayne.
{70204}{70314}Why? He's just another dog-faced|soldier in dirty shirt blue.
{70317}{70376}What do you care if he lives or dies?
{70379}{70510}Did you ever dance with him,|speak to him, or even look at him?
{70530}{70639}No, of course you didn't. No|officer's bars, not a gentleman.
{70641}{70758}I've been finding that some lieutenant's|bars are no guarantee of a gentleman.
{70764}{70817}You're glad about Quayne,
{70818}{70938}because it's a story with a happy|ending to tell back east at a tea party.
{70941}{71014}Now you can tell them|you've seen it all:
{71016}{71096}A real indian fight, a|man shot with an arrow -
{71098}{71179}- Mr Cohill!|- Your tour's just about perfect!
{71180}{71215}Uh...

{71404}{71456}And thank you!
{71546}{71664}Mr Cohill, did anyone ever take|down your breeches and tan your hide?
{71667}{71769}Why, no, Sir - that is - yes,|Sir. My father, Sir, with a strap.
{71772}{71877}Well, I'm old enough to be|your father. Take the point.

{76245}{76318}Found them hiding in the smoke-house.
{76377}{76429}Tyree...
{76465}{76522}It's about time I did retire.
{76524}{76565}Sir?
{76567}{76627}Would you take a|look at Trooper Smith?
{76911}{76974}Don't bother about me, Captain.
{76977}{77045}I trust you'll forgive|my presumption -
{77048}{77140}I commended the boy for the|way he handled this action,

{78886}{78950}Mr Pennell|- picket lines.
{78976}{79030}You don't have to say it, Captain.
{79042}{79166}I know all this is because of me|- because I wanted to see the west.
{79168}{79280}Cos I wasn't... I wasn't army|enough to stay the winter.
{79336}{79462}You're not army yet, but never|apologise, it's a sign of weakness.
{79464}{79526}Yes, but I'm to blame for it.
{79529}{79605}Only the man who|commands can be blamed.
{79608}{79660}It rests on me.
{79692}{79745}Mission failure.
{79966}{80057}Well, we missed the|stage, Miss Dandridge.
{80414}{80492}Well, that's the best I can do.

{85651}{85701}Mr Cohill,
{85702}{85761}it is a bitter thing indeed,
{85763}{85882}to learn that an officer with nine|years' experience in the cavalry,
{85884}{86014}and to whom I am surrendering command|of this troop in two more days,
{86015}{86094}should have so little|grasp of leadership,
{86097}{86220}as to allow himself to be|chivvied into a go at fisty-cuffs
{86222}{86302}while taps still sounds|over a brave man's grave.
{86306}{86372}God help this troop when I'm gone.
{86374}{86422}- Sir - - You're|at attention!
{86424}{86528}- It was a misunderstanding.|- You get back to the troop area!

{101524}{101578}Adjust your saddles and|lift your equipment, men.
{101597}{101649}Pass that on, will you?
{101712}{101790}It's time for me to take my medicine.
{101986}{102038}It tastes horrible!
{102338}{102407}Three parties of them, Mr Cohill.
{102409}{102483}This is the only crossing in 20 miles.
{102486}{102588}I need some time. You've|gotta buy me a long day.
{102590}{102633}Then we'll do it, sir.
{102636}{102679}I know you will, Flint.
{102682}{102833}Flint? It took you nine years to call|me that, sir. It was well worth waiting.
{102834}{102891}We'll get you out of here, son.
{102895}{102966}We'll get you out by noon tomorrow.
{102968}{103013}Prepare to mount!
{103032}{103066}Mount!
{103188}{103241}Flint, wait!
{103318}{103426}Well, haul off and kiss her|back, We haven't got all day!
{103851}{103933}Alright, Miss|Dandridge, if you please.
{104050}{104102}Get mounted.
{104185}{104268}- I guess that's how it is, Ross.|- I understand.
{104272}{104341}Forward...
{104343}{104377}Yo!
{104562}{104614}DISTANT GUNFIRE
{106290}{106356}I have to report the|mission a failure.
{106361}{106462}No, it was our fault! You did|everything a man could do -
{106464}{106590}I've never worn a coat of whitewash|yet, Abby. I won't start now.
{106592}{106714}I failed at Sudrow's. I failed to|keep Rynder's rifles from the tribes.
{106717}{106783}I'll leave the army a failure.
{106788}{106889}- Don't run yourself down|because - - Blast it, Mac!
{106890}{106971}I left Cohill and|two squads back there.
{106973}{107025}In a sound military move.
{107035}{107150}I'd like to rest the troop|for three hours and start back.
{107152}{107236}I'll have Cohill out of|there by noon tomorrow.
{107239}{107315}No, Nathan. The troop|can't leave till dawn.
{107319}{107410}Dawn? Troop ought to|leave before midnight.
{107431}{107493}Yes, if you were leading it -
{107494}{107563}but Pennell will need the daylight.
{107564}{107643}Pennell? That|babe-in-the-wood?
{107646}{107756}Fording a river against a swarm|of hostiles with Winchesters?
{107769}{107860}Aren't you forgetting|you're retiring tomorrow?
{107863}{107926}Tomorrow's all I need, Mac.
{107928}{108009}Look, 40 years a good soldier.
{108011}{108106}I can't leave Cohill|facing those devils.
{108109}{108202}You need more than a day.|They'll be there all winter.
{108203}{108284}Then I'll volunteer|as a civilian scout,
{108286}{108351}as an interpreter, anything.
{108353}{108423}And I thought you were fond of Cohill.
{108426}{108460}Fond of him?
{108462}{108560}When Cohill gave an order,|the men would look at you,
{108562}{108627}to see if he were|doing the right thing.
{108631}{108686}Do you want to ruin the boy?
{108727}{108775}I know, Mac, but...
{108777}{108888}Pennell must learn to cross|a river under fire. So did we.
{108890}{108990}And Cohill's got to run|his chances. We ran them.
{108992}{109047}That's what we get paid for.
{109101}{109166}Well, I guess you're right.
{109211}{109273}I guess you're right.
{109274}{109364}With your permission I'll|quit the post tomorrow.
{109366}{109420}Permission granted, Captain.
{109423}{109483}Where will you go, Nathan?
{109485}{109552}Oh, west, I guess, Abby.
{109554}{109619}California... New settlements.
{109678}{109739}Old soldiers, Miss Dandridge.
{109771}{109860}Some day you'll learn|how they hate to give up.
{109862}{109962}Captain of the troop one day|- every man's face turned towards you,
{109965}{110043}Lieutenants jump when I growl.
{110045}{110108}But tomorrow, I'll be...
{110110}{110194}glad if a blacksmith|asks me to shoe a horse.
{110311}{110378}Abby, if you start sniffling now...
{110395}{110486}- And as for you, young|lady - - I'm not crying.
{110622}{110690}I'd like to stand up and cheer.
{111002}{111036}Time, sir -
{111038}{111111}And it's a black day for the army.
{111186}{111246}Did you sleep well, sir?
{111277}{111311}No.
{111362}{111415}I didn't sleep at all.
{111486}{111520}Well...
{111565}{111640}Clean up the quarters after I'm gone.
{111642}{111746}Sell all this stuff and put|the money in the troop fund.
{111770}{111916}Give Mrs Allshard my extra saddle.|It'll be easier on her... disposition.
{111940}{112013}- And the oya, Sir?|- The oya?
{112015}{112050}Oh, yes.
{112065}{112117}The water bowl.
{112178}{112244}Well! How did it ever get there?
{112246}{112303}Now, how do you suppose?
{112305}{112432}- How long have you know it, sir?|- Since the battle of Bull Run, stupid.
{112434}{112518}And you've been deceiving|me all these years.
{112862}{112920}Well, there's that.
{113008}{113107}I'd say my retirement was|an occasion for a drink.
{113109}{113199}- Help yourself.|- No, I'd take no pleasure in it, sir.
{113201}{113299}But if it's an order,|here's to your health.
{113462}{113582}Only 14 days for myself and I'll be|wearing one of those monkey suits too.
{113584}{113634}Only one I ever owned.
{113636}{113784}I was a barefoot lad in blue jeans when|I left daddy's farm to join the army.
{113791}{113895}Well, Sergeant, I haven't|had a drink since that day,
{113933}{113999}but I'd like to drink|to your retirement.
{114001}{114068}No, sir! I'll do the honours for you.
{114071}{114123}Well, thank you.
{114312}{114379}Wait, Captain, till I get your blouse.
{114380}{114425}What?
{114459}{114542}- The men will like it, Sir.|- Oh, yeah.
{114545}{114596}Last time.
{114608}{114711}I'll review the troops|alone this morning, Sergeant.
{114743}{114856}Break in that suit of store|clothes for me, will you?
{114858}{114892}A suit?
{114895}{114974}Yeah! Try it on! See how it looks.
{116255}{116337}- C Troop, all present, sir.|- Thank you, sir.
{116433}{116475}Men,
{116501}{116559}I won't be going out with you.
{116609}{116682}I won't be here when you return.
{116722}{116774}I wish I could.
{116817}{116935}But I know your performance|under your new commander
{116938}{117013}will make me proud of you...
{117077}{117166}as I've always been proud of you.
{117196}{117300}One moment please,|Captain. Corporal Krumrein!
{117361}{117433}Sir, a small token from the troop.
{117472}{117590}They all put in the hat for it, sir|- even Sergeant Hochbauer.
{117731}{117819}It's solid silver, sir.|Brought from Kansas City.
{117821}{117880}There's a sentiment on the back.
{118309}{118428}"To Captain Brittles from C Troop."

{120569}{120632}With the girl I left behind me
{121939}{121984}Oh.
{121986}{122039}Give me a side view.
{122090}{122194}That's perfect! It's|made for you, Quincannon
{122222}{122300}You should go to the|sutler's and order one,
{122302}{122362}so that when you retire you...
{122364}{122474}Here, have a couple of|drinks while you're waiting.
{123170}{123245}You're out of uniform, Quincannon.
{123268}{123322}- Oh, I am, am I?|- You are.

{123624}{123659}Yes, sir?
{123661}{123780}Sergeant Quincannon is improperly|dressed on duty and he's drunk.
{123782}{123846}Throw him in the guard house.
{123849}{123895}Alone, Sir?

{123970}{124040}Wagner, give Hochbauer a hand.
{124207}{124253}Come, Fritz.
{124313}{124391}- How do I look, Connolly?|- What'll you have?
{124424}{124530}A little drop of whisky -|Irish - and I'll pour it myself.
{124575}{124686}And... and when I've drained|that up, just throw me out.
{124746}{124836}Hans, I want you to help|me arrest Quincannon.
{124838}{124927}I'd love to throw that|big Mick in the cooler.
{125162}{125208}You're under arrest, Quincannon.

{126335}{126417}Connolly, did you hear|- the buffalo are back?
{126420}{126480}- Buffalo?|- Herds of them.

{129980}{130032}Forward, yo!
{130261}{130376}Alright, Nathan, I get it! Ten days|in the guard house and no charges.
{130378}{130464}Can't you make it two|weeks, Mac? Till he retires?
{130465}{130619}A man with a thirst like that couldn't|get by on less than a sergeant's pension.

{130939}{130991}Say goodbye to Abby.

{147715}{147824}Can you read what time it is|by my brand new silver watch?
{147859}{147935}It's two minutes past midnight, sir.
{147937}{147980}Oh.
{148026}{148099}I've been a civilian for two minutes.
{148142}{148232}It's your army, Mr Cohill. Good luck!

- Any of you boys got change for 10 cents?
- No, sir.
Well, keep the baggage.
Tickets for the West at this window!
One ticket for the West, end of line.
Yes, sir. That'll be $70, please.
There's your $70.
Don't bother counting it.
- There's only $60 here.
- I told you not to count it.
You need $10 more.
It's highway robbery.
No wonder you're behind bars.
I'll get that other $10.
Someday I'll be president of this railroad, and when I am...
Hey, mister.
Is this the right way for my brother to get on the train for the West?
Not unless they're throwing a masquerade party out West, it isn't.
- All we wanna know is where's the train.
- The train? It's out on the tracks.
It seldom comes in here.
Come on, Rusty, I'll buy you a ticket.
Where's your $70?
You only got $10?
What did you do with the other $60?
You buy a snake?
I can't get you a ticket if you ain't got enough money.
Money?
- You two gents are heading West, partner?
- Not me. Just my brother.
You see, I got no money.
So he's going West.
When he gets off the train, he'll pick up some gold and send it to me.
They say the gold is laying all over the streets.
All over the streets you find the gold.
The way he's dressed, he looks like he was laying all over the streets.
Of course the gold is all over the streets, but they won't let him take any.
He's a tenderfoot.
You wear those shoes, you've got tender feet, too.
Those are shoes?
I thought that was fungus with buttons.
All right, suppose he's got tender feet.
You don't pick up gold with feet.
No, you don't understand.
A tenderfoot is an easterner.
Out West, they shoot at anything that looks Eastern.
They'll blow his head off if he goes out West with that flea incubator.
What's the matter with that hat?
It cost a lot of money.
- How much did it cost him?
- I don't know. He stole it.
- What's the idea?
- Wait a minute!
I'm just trying to save his life.
- You love your brother, don't you?
- No, but I'm used to him.
Now, this is the kind of hat they're wearing this season.
This is the 1870 model.
It's what they call a pioneer's cap.
Isn't that tail supposed to be in the back?
Not on him.
- That's genuine beaver.
- It's pretty.
I'll stroke it. It's still my hat, you know.
That'll be $10.
- You want $10 for that old beaver?
- I'm not in business for love.
I was in love once and I got the business.
But that's another story, and a very unpleasant one, too.
Why should he buy a hat?
He ain't got enough money for a ticket.
You can always get a ticket.
But this is the last hat of its kind.
The Beavers have stopped making them.
They're all out playing football. $10.
He's a poor boy. He'll give you $1.
You take it?
I'll take it, but I'm only making $1 on it.
Rusty, give him $1.
What floor was that on?
First business I've ever done with a dust storm.
It'll cost me $1 to have this cleaned.
$9 change, please.
- What change?
- That's $10.
Yes, so it is.
Money lover.
A dollar's a dollar, and every dollar is taking me further West.
Us, too.
- What are you laughing at?
- That hat.
It looks ridiculous with that coat he's got on.
- What's the matter with that coat?
- They clash.
I have a coat that goes with that hat.
Have you got a moment?
Come over here, son.
Now, this is a coat that's really a coat.
There's the finest deerskin jacket
I've ever seen.
Looks like it was made-to-order.
Now, let's see.
That's $20 plus $1. That's $21.
We meet you halfway. We give you $1.
You must have come the short way.
- Come on, Rusty. Give him $1.
- That's fine.
- Adios, gentlemen.
- $9 change, please.
- Change?
- That's $10.
So it is.
- Say, it looks a lot like the other one.
- It should.
Here's your change.
It's a pleasure to do business with a man like you.
Our slogan is,
"The customer is always right."
Say, did you see something flying across here?
- Might have been a pigeon.
- No, it wasn't a pigeon. It was green.
- Must have been a frog.
- It had numbers on it.
Those were the license plates.
I guess it's my... No, it isn't.
I can't seem to locate that $20 you gave me.
What $20? We no give you $20.
We give you $2.
$1 for the hat, and $1 for the coat.
That's right, yes, but you gave me two $10.
Sure, and you give us $18 change.
$18 from $20 is $2.
- And you got mixed up.
- So stupid of me.
There's something corrupt going on around my pants... and I just can't seem to locate it.
If you think we're crooked, we give you another $1.
I'm sorry if I had you fellows pegged wrong.
I must have misunderstood you.
$9 change, please.
- You wouldn't wanna give me $1?
- No.
How about giving me 10 singles and I'll give you 9 singles change?
- But we got no singles.
- I just gave him $18.
He sends money home to his mother.
- You want $1?
- Not if it's gonna cost me $9.
- You should watch your money.
- I'll watch my money. You watch him.
$9 change, please.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
You count good, but where's the change?
- Didn't I just give it to you?
- No.
Rusty, did he give it to you?
You must have given it to yourself.
Somebody's giving it to me.
You know, all I want to do is go West... not go broke. Good day, gentlemen.
- You forgot something.
- Now what's the matter?
- The sales tax.
- What sales tax?
For the stuff you just sold us.
We gotta give you another $1.
No, thanks. I couldn't afford it.
But it's against the law not to charge tax.
- You wanna go to jail?
- I won't say anything if you don't.
I won't say anything, but he might.
- What does he want to keep quiet?
- Nothing.
All he wants to do is to give you another $1.
- He doesn't want $9 change?
- No, he'll take $5 and $4.
Give me it.
He'll take $5 and $4.
One, two.
Here's $3. There's $4.
Five, six, seven, eight, nine.
You know what I say,
I like to do business with you... because I knew you were honest the first time I see you.
The cornerstone of my success is integrity.
- That's right.
- That's the only secure foundation.
That's what I said when I see you.
- When you have that, you have everything.
- Right. I know you're a good man.
I gotta do business.
I don't care about anything else.
You can conduct it another way, but it's not permanent.
It's not the kind of thing you can build your success on.
- That has been the climax of my success.
- That's what I said.
It's suddenly gotten very chilly in here.
Well, goodbye.
It seems that I've strayed into a den of thieves.
However, it's a wise man that profits by his previous mistakes... and from herein, gentlemen...
I have made some other financial arrangements.
It's been nice knowing you, gentlemen.
I'm glad to have made your acquaintance, and a good day to you both.
- Good day.
- Goodbye.
Come on, Rusty.
Gentlemen, this is Mr. Terry Turner who has just arrived from the West.
- Hello.
- How do you do?
Young man, I want you to tell these gentlemen what you told me this morning.
I understand you are thinking of building a railroad... from Cripple Creek north around the mountain.
And I'd like to ask you to go in another direction.
I'd say the straightest way to go... would be from Cripple Creek here straight through to the Pacific.
You expect our trains to fly over the mountains?
No, sir.
I expect your trains to go through here,
Dead Man's Gulch.
May I ask why you're so interested in seeing that this land is sold?
Yes, sir. So that I can get married.
I think I understand.
- You own the land.
- No, sir, but my grandfather did.
He being quite a crook, he unloaded it on my girl's grandfather, Dan Wilson.
Old Dan's been sore about it ever since.
It started a feud between us Turners and the Wilsons.
And now he won't let me marry his granddaughter.
If I could just prove to him that I'm not a crook... then maybe he could see the light.
After all, he's not a bad old coot.
I think Beecher should leave as soon as he can to contact...
Dan Wilson, sir.
And arrange for the purchase of the Dead Man's Gulch.
I don't know what's the matter.
I dig and dig, and the hole gets no bigger.
- I'm moving on.
- Yeah, but how about the gold?
There ain't no gold here.
I've been working Dead Man's Gulch off and on for 40 years.
I'm convinced.
Mr. Wilson, why don't you quit?
I've got a little granddaughter who's gotta be taken care of...
- and I won't last forever.
- Where you going?
I'll get a job until I get a grubstake, and then I'll try again somewhere.
How much is a grubstake?
I reckon about $10 would see me through.
- We give you the $10.
- No, I couldn't take it.
But we got lots of money.
Then I'll take it, but it's just a loan.
That's all right.
Come on, Rusty, give him the $10.
No strings attached.
- Here you are.
- You gotta take some security... and I ain't got no security except a deed to Dead Man's Gulch.
- No, we no take your land.
- I'd feel better if you took it.
I don't reckon it's worth $10, though.
A fellow named Turner sold it to me about 40 years ago.
Got me for my last cent.
If you boys meet up with any Turner in this territory, shoot first.
First we steal his gun, then we shoot.
And, boys, when you get to Birch City...
Look in on my little granddaughter, will you?
And tell her her old granddad will be back soon.
We'll tell her.
Let's go back to work. Come on.
Indians? You're crazy.
There's no Indians around here.
You can't walk around like that.
What do you think of it, Mr. Turner?
Now, Grandpa, stop glaring at Terry.
The Turners aren't as bad as you think.
Not all of them, anyway.
Darling!
- Darling, you've been gone a million years.
- Just three weeks.
- You were a million miles away.
- Only 2,000. Just to New York.
This is wrong.
You're a Turner and I'm a Wilson.
You should hate me and I should hate you.
Say, that sounds convincing.
- You mean it?
- Of course.
This much.
Do you hate me?
Yes. This much.
Hate me some more.
Terry, you really shouldn't be here.
If Grandpa ever sees you around...
Your grandpa won't be able to see enough of me when he gets the $50,000.
- Fifty thousand what?
- Dollars, from the railroad company.
I sold them Dead Man's Gulch.
You sold Dead Man's...
I had a hunch, and I followed it to New York.
I convinced the New York and Western... a road through Dead Man's Gulch would save them a fortune.
If that don't square things between our families... then your grandpa is a man who just loves to hate.
But I love to hate.
I promise to hate, honor, and obey you the rest of my life.
Eve, before I take you up on that...
I gotta fix it with your grandpa.
Where is he?
- Out in the desert, I guess.
- I've got to find him.
But not just yet.
That's no good. That's for horses.
I know you're thirsty. I'm thirsty, too.
Come on, we go into the saloon.
I get you a drink.
Rusty, I no like the West.
All the people do is kill each other.
I'd like the West better if it was in the East.
Let's get out of here.
Letter. Pony express for you.
Game is over, boys.
Now, look here, Pete... a whole week has gone by and you still ain't brought Wilson in.
Get some more men.
Get some fresh horses.
I don't care how you do it, but you find that desert rat.
Take it away.
Thirsty? My throat is dry, just like the desert.
Yours, too?
Another, Joe.
Okay. There it is, Pete.
Hey, you!
What's the matter with you?
Put that down!
- What's going on here?
- Couple of tinhorns from the East.
Told them no money, no beer.
Then I turn my back, and he steals a glass.
- Why, you...
- He no steal it, mister.
We don't want no trouble. I'll pay.
You don't look as if you had a dime between you.
No, but I give you an IOU.
Did you hear that, boy? An I owe me.
Sure, we're honest. We always pay.
Here, I owe you 10 cents. Joseph Panello.
That's rich and rare.
A business transaction, Joe.
Put it in the cash register before somebody steals it.
Come on, you financiers, beat it.
Get out of here.
- You know where Dan Wilson's house is?
- Dan Wilson? Sure.
You just go half a mile up the road.
You can't miss it.
Say, you can do me a favor.
I got a telegram for Dan Wilson.
You can deliver it and save me the trip.
Sure, we'll deliver the telegram.
Maybe it's good news.
- There you are, and thanks very much.
- That's all right.
Dan Wilson. That means we don't open it.
You promise?
Right.
All right. We open it but we don't read it.
I no think I can trust you.
And I know you can't trust me.
So I tell you what we do.
I'll read it, but we don't listen.
Come on, put the fingers up.
Rusty, I cheated.
I listened.
You, too.
Mr. Beecher, we're here to meet you!
We're supposed to meet you!
Are you looking for John Beecher?
Sure, we've come to see him about selling Dead Man's Gulch to the Railroad.
That's fine.
I'm John Beecher.
We don't recognize you, do we, Rusty?
Naturally you don't recognize me.
We've never met.
Then how do I know it's you?
If I don't know what Mr. Beecher looks like... the only way I can tell it's him is if he wears a white carnation.
Well, the very idea!
I don't know anything about...
Now, look here, you two...
Old Mr. Beecher, we look all over for you.
- We're so glad to see you.
- Yes, I'm glad that's settled.
Now, which one of you gentlemen is Mr. Wilson?
None of us.
We got a name: Panello.
But we own the land.
- You have the deed with you?
- Sure.
I mean, no.
He's trying to tell us it's home in Birch City.
We'd better go there immediately.
Come along, gentlemen.
Just follow me, please.
Why you tell him where the deed is?
All the time you talk too much.
From now on, you keep your hands shut.
If that's only a mirage coming,
I'm gonna look like you in a few days.
Come on, stranger, hop in.
- Where did I see your face before?
- Right where it is now.
Blondie, how would you like to buy a diamond necklace... that formerly belonged to the Czarina of Russia?
- How did you get it?
- I used to room with Rasputin.
- I'll buy it. Lend me $10.
- Sure, Mr. Panello.
$9 change, please.
Let's forget about it.
Madam, why is that baby constantly crying?
He can't stand the jerks in the coach.
Now wait a minute, boys.
It was nothing personal.
She didn't mean anything by it.
$10 for every ditch you hit.
- I'm so sorry.
- I must get myself straightened around.
- That's it, around.
- Let my bustle go!
Attaboy.
- I can fix this bustle myself!
- All right, he's just helping you.
Madam, it's none of my business, but are you wearing a revolving door?
If you are,
I'd like to go around with you sometime.
Mr. Panello, instead of bargaining with you for the rights of the land...
I intend to make you a liberal offer, which I feel you'll instantly accept.
How much you gonna pay us for this land?
$500! We're gonna be rich!
Now, all I need is both your signatures.
On the bottom.
There you are. Thank you.
I'll give you $1,000.
- How dare you, you meddlesome fool!
- I heard that!
If you weren't so small,
I'd flog the daylights out of you.
- But I'm bigger than you.
- That's another reason.
You'll pay us double for this land than the Railroad?
Yes, and it's a lucky thing for you
I got here in time.
Mr. Panello, you don't know who he represents.
At least you know my offer is bona fide.
That's right.
How do we know your offer is bona fide?
- Are your hands clean?
- Sure.
Then here's my card.
"Bona Fide Oil Company.
S. Quentin Quale, Pres."
Look. His whole company is bona fide.
In all my long business experience,
I've dealt with every important oil firm...
- and I've never heard of your company.
- You haven't?
Evidently you don't read the bankruptcy notices.
It works out fine.
We get your land, you get $1,000... and our friend here gets bounced by the Railroad... for letting this oily deal slip through his greasy fingers.
If you don't mind, would you mind taking your feet down?
It's a good joke.
Wait till the Railroad hears about this.
It's more than your land is worth, really... but I'll stretch a point. $1,500.
Oh, boy. Stop it.
For $1,500, I write good.
- He says $6,000. What do you say?
- I wash my hands of this whole deal!
Try this soap.
We're having a special on it today.
It's $1 a cake, or two cakes for 25 cents.
Where's my bag?
Please. The contract.
Now, gentlemen, please...
Give me my hat!
- What's the idea?
- Where is my hat?
- Where's my hat?
- Where is my hat? There it is.
Here's yours.
Gentlemen, I have a whole railroad on my shoulders...
- and I'd like to get something done!
- I want my hat!
You have my hat, madam. Here's your hat.
Have you a fountain pen?
I've got to get a contract signed.
Do you mind if I take my hat?
I've never been on a trip like this before.
Where is it anyway? Who has my bustle?
- Sit in your own seat.
- Give me my bustle!
- Mr. Beecher, no hard feelings.
- Wait, Panello.
I'll admit you've got me in hot water, but...
Please.
Why don't you let me get this signed?
- Where's my hat?
- Here.
Nobody can outshoot Two-Gun Quale.
Boys, sweep them out of the gutter.
- Why, there's nobody out there.
- Well, sweep out the gutter.
Say, all the beautiful stems in here are not on the wine glasses.
Lulubelle, it's you.
I didn't recognize you standing up.
- Vamoose, you goose.
- Nice piece of poetry.
Say, if you wanna stay healthy,
I'd keep shy of Lulubelle.
She's Red Baxter's girl.
Who's Red Baxter?
We'll settle this right now.
- Where's Red Baxter?
- Here.
- Where?
- Here!
You should've been home.
The pot of gold called.
Yes, they want their pot back.
- Why, you...
- Hold on, Red.
This is the gentleman who's selling us the deed to the Wilson property.
No hard feelings, stranger.
Welcome to Crystal Palace.
Now then, Quale, have you the deed with you?
I'll have the deed pronto, whatever that means.
- That's fine. Bring it to Mr. Baxter's office.
- Yes.
Lulubelle, I want you to be good to this little boy here.
- Come on, son.
- Bye, Daddy.
I'll sell Red the deed.
Then if you get your father's consent... we'll get married, if I can get my wife's consent.
Step aside, boys. This is love on the run.
- Yes. Let's have the deed.
- We ain't got it exactly.
I made them agree to $10,000, and now you stall. Get the deed.
We'll get it if you lend us 10 cents.
10 cents?
I'm promoting this deal, not financing it.
Here.
How they handle all this and ride a horse at the same time is beyond me.
She's mad about me, as what woman isn't?
I know, you're going to ask what is my secret.
You rotter. You scrounge.
The secret is never let her know you care.
Never pursue her. Let her pursue you.
Fan the flame of desire with the bellows of indifference.
Didn't we meet at Monte Carlo the night you blew your brains out?
How we laughed!
Foolish, foolish child.
It's madness, this thing that's happened to us.
It can never be.
We come from different stock.
Suppose I brought you to my country place... at Drooling-on-the-Lapel?
What would my people say?
They'd phrase it more delicately.
Go! Let's break clean.
Rusty, now's your chance.
Nobody's looking. Get back the IOUs.
Why don't you let me go?
Let's keep this a perfect memory... and someday this bitter ache shall pass, my sweet.
Time wounds all heals.
There's a drunk sitting at the first table who looks exactly like you.
And one who looks exactly like me.
Dull, isn't it?
He's so full of alcohol... if you put a lighted wick in his mouth, he'd burn for three days.
Here's the deed. Let's collect.
You got the bag for the money?
Fine. You wait here and I'll be right back.
It's our deed and our money.
Why should you go alone?
I give you my word as an embezzler that I'll be back in two minutes.
Rusty, in two minutes,
Dan Wilson is gonna be rich.
Let's have some fun. Come on.
Rusty, I'm so happy
I'd like to play the piano.
You want I should play?
It's about time.
I thought you wasn't gonna ask me.
Mister, can I play the piano?
He said yes. All right.
Yeah, sure. Two minutes is all we got.
We can relax now. No matter what route the Railroad decides on... they'll have to come to terms with Beecher and Baxter.
Baxter and Beecher.
- Yes, of course.
- Yes.
Mr. Quale, everything is signed, sealed, and delivered.
Yeah, but not yet paid for.
Let's get down to brass tacks, or rather, greenbacks.
How about the $10,000?
This alligator hasn't eaten in a week.
- What are you talking about?
- The money this volcano owes me... for making those numskulls hand over Dead Man's Gulch.
That's right.
Our friend bid me up to $10,000... when all they wanted was $500.
Competition's the life of trade.
Not around here, it ain't.
How about $9,000? $8,000?
How about $6,000?
How about the combination to the safe?
We don't want to appear like we're not grateful.
We're gonna give you $500.
$500? I came up here intending to cheat those two fellows out of $10,000.
You want me to cheat them out of $500?
What do you think I am? A cheat?
It's impossible.
I just got another idea.
We are not gonna pay you nothing.
That's one way of reducing your overhead.
- I want that deed back.
- Not a chance.
- Baxter, I want that deed back.
- Not a chance.
I'm not through with you yet.
There's a law in this state.
Before you call in the law, there's something I want to show you.
Wait a minute! I'll fix that.
- See that shelf down there by the bar?
- Yes.
- Do you see the bottles on the shelf?
- Yes.
- Do you see the corks on the bottles?
- Yes.
- You see that man sleeping at the table?
- Yes.
- See his nose?
- Yes.
- See the fly on the end of his nose?
- Yes.
You've certainly got good eyesight.
- Here, water! Give him some water.
- Brandy.
Force brandy down my throat.
Where's the dime I lent you?
Look, the bag is empty.
Where's the money?
I gave them the deed, but they refused to give me the $10,000.
I'd have hit them within an inch of their lives, but I'd no tape measure.
You said you was an embezzler, but you don't fool me. I knew you was a crook.
There's only one law in the West:
The law of blood and bullets.
It's either shoot or get shot.
- What are we gonna do?
- Sue 'em.
Come on, Rusty.
We'll show them you're not afraid.
Look out, Red!
This must be the house.
Listen. It's nice.
She must be the girl who minds the baby.
Don't be afraid of us, miss.
We're friends of Dan Wilson.
- You are?
- Sure.
Any resemblance between these two characters and living persons... is purely accidental.
Come in.
I didn't mean to be rude.
I was expecting someone else.
Won't you sit down, please?
I thought I knew all of Grandpa's friends but I don't seem to recognize you.
Of course not. You don't know me.
People who know him don't recognize him either.
Could we please see
Dan Wilson's little granddaughter?
- I'm his granddaughter.
- I'm expecting a baby.
You'd make a wonderful mother.
Are you sure you're not a little baby?
Because we brought you a present.
- It's lovely.
- Yeah, that's the best one we could steal.
Now Dan Wilson's got two little babies.
Do you know where my grandpa is?
I'm awfully worried about him.
He has a deed to some property the Railroad wants to buy...
- and we can't find him.
- Your grandpop ain't got the deed.
- You know who's got the deed?
- No.
Your grandpop.
- Is anything wrong?
- No.
- Is something wrong with Grandpa?
- No, everything is fine.
That's good.
He's been so wonderful to me.
Gone without things just so I could have them.
Now he'll be able to have everything he's always wanted and couldn't afford.
He'll be able to go places he's read about and couldn't see.
It'll be wonderful for us, too.
Terry and me, I mean.
We can get married.
Just one little thing happens and the whole world is different.
- There is something wrong, isn't there?
- The only thing wrong... is that your grandfather's deed is in Red Baxter's safe.
Red Baxter? My grandfather wouldn't have anything to do with him.
- He knows he's a crook.
- We didn't.
You see, Miss Wilson, your grandfather gave the deed to these boys.
Security for a loan.
And Red Baxter stole it from them.
Don't worry. You couldn't help it.
But if you see Grandpa, don't mention it to him.
What almost happened, I mean.
You see, he's old.
What about this Terry?
We're young. Another miracle will happen.
You're right. Come on, miracle men.
We also double at weddings as best men.
Will you keep quiet?
We've gotta work fast.
Baxter might come back.
Don't be afraid. If any trouble starts, we'll telephone for help.
Telephone? This is 1870.
Don Ameche hasn't invented the telephone yet.
The safe's in there. Come on.
- There she is, gentlemen. Proceed.
- That's a boy.
- Come on, Mary Lou. We can relax in here.
- Okay.
Those dopes are trying to crack open the safe.
Send for Baxter and the boys.
- Where are they?
- I don't know. Find them!
How will I find them?
I don't know where they are.
Wait a minute.
- Did you say something?
- I no say nothing.
If it's me, my voice is certainly changing.
Carry on.
You dope!
That will teach you. Never trust me again.
Listen, you bring back some drinks, and I'll try to keep them here.
- Can you handle all three?
- No.
Better bring another girl.
That redhead's a demon.
I could swear I heard voices.
There's nothing to worry about.
They're in the next room.
They are?
It's you.
I wish you'd stop talking to yourself.
Now, if you'll pardon me, I'm busy.
- Why, honey child.
- I'm not that busy.
Let's go somewhere where we can be alone.
There doesn't seem to be anyone on this couch.
I got a hunch Quale ain't got his mind on his business.
Who hasn't?
That don't look like Red Baxter.
I beg your pardon,
I thought you were Mr. Baxter.
My eyes aren't what they used to be.
- Who do you wish to see?
- Not "who." Whom do you wish to see?
At my age, corrected by an illiterate.
I thought you were up here looking for the deed.
I was just trying to find out what she knows.
She looks like she knows plenty, but not about the deed.
Come on, let's go back to work.
- Hello, boys.
- Maybe we can work in here.
No, I think we better toddle along.
We'll be back later, girls.
- Me, alone.
- Me, too.
- Did you get Baxter?
- Yes, he's on his way.
- Did you miss me?
- Hello, lambie-pie.
Sure, now, you can't up and leave us.
Gentlemen, how would you all like a mint julep?
It's been years since I've tasted the nectar of the Old South.
However, if you insist.
I take one, too, just so he don't drink alone.
We get them drunk, then they won't know what we're here after.
That's right, blabbermouth, keep it a secret.
You keep them busy, and I'll help Rusty crack open the S-A-F-F.
You're a one-man fifth column.
- You wanna know something?
- Not a great deal.
Dixie just wouldn't be Dixie without a mint julep.
And you know something else, Scarlett?
Dixie wouldn't be Dixie without Dixie.
My compliments on this julep, ladies.
It's as sweet as you are, and twice as cool.
- Have another one, honey child.
- I'll take one more.
If you insist, I'll have eight more.
Come on, let's sing.
Mint juleps always make me sing.
Let's just drink.
How about some more mint juice?
- No, come on, let's sing.
- Yeah, come on.
- Come on, girls, we'll all sing now.
- Let's sing!
How about another drink?
Don't put any ice in mine.
It takes up too much room.
Gentlemen, let's drink to the South, land of milk and honey.
The bee who collected this honey must have some hangover.
A toast to where we girls was born:
South Carolina.
Mississippi.
Louisiana.
I thought these girls were sisters.
They are, but their mother lived in a trailer.
It's a funny thing. I'm not drunk, but what's the ceiling doing on the floor?
Your julep, coming right up.
What? Before I drink it?
You know something?
My stomach, she feels cute.
A toast to where we girls was born:
South Carolina.
Mississippi.
Louisiana.
I feel another song coming on.
Never mind the song.
A toast to where we girls was born:
South Carolina.
Mississippi.
Louisiana.
Hold tight, toots.
I feel another song coming on.
I'm gonna sing you a song that I wrote myself... with the aid of Stephen Foster.
A toast to where we girls was born:
South Carolina.
Mississippi. Louisiana.
Let me off at Rhode Island.
- Have another, honey child.
- I'll take one more.
If you insist, I'll have eight more.
Come on, let's sing.
Mint juleps always make me sing.
No, let's just drink.
How about some more mint juice?
No, come on, let's sing. Come on!
To my father, Col. Rufus Quale.
To Sunday dinner on the old plantation.
Chicken okra, corn pone, shortening bread... pickled watermelon, and a stomach pump.
Gentlemen, the South.
Less whiskey next time.
My glass can't take it.
- Come on, put them up!
- Come on, girls.
- Sober them up.
- Come on, you two. Sober up.
Pull yourself up.
- I must be drunk.
- Come on, up you go.
Scarlett, sugar, I loves you.
Stand up on your feet, you weasels.
Come on, stand up.
Red, the safe's open. The deed's gone.
- That redhead must've taken it.
- Find him.
You say you're sorry and we'll let you go.
Shut up. Now turn around.
No, the other way.
No, the both of you!
Turn around and face the window!
Go on, now.
- I don't like your faces.
- I suppose you think we like them.
Drop that cannon. Put your hands up.
Drop that gun and get your hands up.
Drop gun. Put your hands up.
All right, Pete, drop your gun and get your hands up.
I wouldn't have known where to come if Eve hadn't left me an invitation.
All right, folks, you can break ranks now.
Not you.
Maybe Mr. Beecher would like to return the deed.
- It's not here. It's been stolen.
- Sure, you stole it.
Good. Put it in your pocket.
We'll deliver the deed to the railroad officials in New York... just to save you the trouble.
All right, boys, outside. You, too, Eve.
Which way did the women go?
You know, Beecher, it takes a smart man to know when he's licked.
Maybe between you two there's enough brains to figure that out.
Come on!
Open up this door and let us out of here.
- Red, wait a minute.
- Wait a minute, nothing!
If they deliver that deed to the officials, we're sunk.
The only way they can get back East is on the train that leaves tomorrow.
I know.
If they miss that train, they'll have to wait a week for the next one.
- Can you sell our land to the railroad?
- In a week, I can sell them anything.
We'll be on that train tomorrow, but something tells me they'll miss it.
Come on, open up!
Do you think it's safe to stay here tonight?
These Indians are friendly if you treat them right.
Wait here.
I don't know why we don't sleep at a regular motel.
That's the silliest-looking object
I've ever seen.
Eve, you take the small tepee.
We'll share the other. Come on.
She gave him the Indian sign.
Are you the chief that runs from Chicago to Los Angeles in 39 hours?
Now wait a minute.
See, you got the chief mad.
Let me talk to him.
- Can you talk Indian?
- I was born in Indianapolis.
He wants to know if you want starch in your shirts.
Why don't you open the window?
Panello, this Indian's no Indian.
If he's no Indian, why is he wearing a chicken for a hat?
He's half-Indian and half-ostrich.
Stop trying to pass yourself off as a red man.
Why, you can't even speak the language.
Let me hear you recite Hiawatha by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.
That's not it.
If it is, they've shortened it since I went to school.
And you call yourself a red man.
And you call yourself a white man.
Let's go.
What did he say?
He said first they'll give us a fair trial, then they'll kill us.
White man talk too much.
Make chief heap mad.
White man red man's friend.
White man wanna make friends with red brother.
And sister, too.
Are you insinuating that the white man is not the Indian's friend?
Who swindled you out of Manhattan Island for $24?
White man.
Who stood your wooden statue in front of a cigar store?
Who put your head on a nickel and then took the nickel away?
Slot machine.
Members of the tribe...
I rest my case.
How would you like a little necklace that belonged to the Czarina of Russia?
No like. Me want Cadillac sedan.
She's been off the reservation.
Wait a minute.
I don't want a scalp treatment.
Look, just to prove we're your friends, we give you this totem pole.
It's stimulating when two giant intellects get together.
- Who's that?
- Him medicine man.
That's a medicine man?
Can you imagine taking a teaspoonful of him every three hours?
Chief like paleface who no talk.
You paleface friend. Chief like you, too.
Red man, you're a white man.
Come on.
You get a canoe later, and I'll paddle you.
Let's go.
I tell you, there's nothing to worry about.
They ain't gonna get on that train, not while my boys are on the job.
- You haven't seen them?
- No.
- Well?
- It's no use.
Baxter's men are everywhere.
I'll get on the train if I have to shoot my way on.
They'll outshoot you 10-to-1.
If they reach New York first and sell their land, the deed'll be worthless.
We could ride ahead and get on at the next station.
That's right. We'll cut through the pass.
Come on.
I got an idea we better get on that train, too.
- Get off of that train. You're fired.
- What is this?
You're both fired.
You got no driver's license.
- I'll get this guy!
- I'll take care of you.
Run him through!
Touché!
I hate train rides. Don't you, Red?
Not this one, baby.
There's $250,000 at the end of the line.
"Pressure valve. Piston rods.
"How to cool off a hotbox."
Maybe that book is no good.
Of course it's good.
It's an engineer's manual.
But suppose the engineer's name ain't Manuel?
Then he's gotta change his name.
He can't make a fool out of this book.
Here we are: "How to start an engine."
Slowly pull the throttle.
They need better engineers on this road.
When they pay for our land, they won't have money left for engineers.
Attaboy, Rusty!
Rusty steers good.
The train is still on the track.
We must be coming to the station.
Yeah, I just remembered.
We gotta stop the train for the kids.
How're you gonna stop it?
It doesn't say in here.
Maybe it's in the next issue.
Wait a minute, I'll find out.
Hey, brother, how do you stop this thing?
The brake! Get me out of this!
You know, this is the best gag in the picture.
The brake!
He said something about the brake.
The brake!
Attaboy, Rusty. You break the brake.
Come on, honey. We made it.
How do we stop?
Try dragging your feet.
Come on. We stop the train. Follow us.
No, let's borrow this.
They're following us.
I don't understand.
We're supposed to stop.
Tell the engineer full speed ahead.
No stops.
I'll tell him myself. Come on, Beecher.
- Come on, Beecher!
- Right with you, Red.
They've tied up the engineer and fireman.
Come on, hurry up!
There's something about you that brings out the animal in me.
I know how to stop the train.
We pull the cord.
She's at top speed and now they wanna stop!
- Don't stop!
- We won't stop!
It's no stop.
That's what you get for back-seat driving.
- Company's coming.
- Wait a minute!
We've finally caught up with you.
Stay where you are, Beecher.
We'll be out of this tunnel in a minute.
I'm not going to waste any more time on you.
- Catch them, Red.
- Come on.
Where'd you get his gun? In the tunnel?
That's good.
- Where'd they go?
- Up the ladder, I guess.
We make the engineer stop the train.
They're up forward. Come on.
We'll uncouple the cars and leave them behind.
That ought to get rid of them.
We'll uncouple the cars and leave them behind.
That's a good idea.
That's fine.
We're on the wrong car!
Hang on, Rusty.
Don't let the train get away!
- Here they come!
- And here we go.
Lulubelle, you have beautiful eyes.
I hope you kids have a deck of cards.
The only way to stop the engine is to put water on the fire.
Hold on, Eve. Giddap!
Just a minute, Red.
What happened?
What's the matter?
- First we throw the wood off.
- Splendid.
Get away from that wood!
Leave that wood alone!
- Get away from there!
- Drop that wood!
- There they are.
- I'll take care of them.
- Where are you?
- I can't see.
Hold on, there.
- There he is.
- Come and get me, boys.
- Get him, Red.
- I'll get you. I'll skin you alive!
Carsick.
Seasick.
If you gentlemen want anything, just ring.
Let's get this fire out. That'll stop it.
I wish Rusty would hurry up with the water.
- This is good.
- Now she'll stop.
Dante's inferno.
- Terry, they're stopping!
- Come on, boy! Giddap!
We stopped the train.
See, I tell you we stop the train.
I knew you would stop the train.
I'm just as surprised as you are.
If that's water,
I'm glad I don't touch the stuff.
We gotta stop it. How do you stop it?
I don't know.
I've never been in an engine before.
Open the door.
How many times do I have to let you boys out?
- This train is out of fuel.
- This rig will get us there.
Stop it! Stop that horse!
There they go.
There goes our last chance to help those kids.
We've gotta get after them.
But we can't start the train.
There's no more wood.
There's plenty of wood.
What are you worrying about?
They can't follow us without any fuel.
There's no wood left on the train.
- What do you mean there's no wood?
- Look around.
- We'll keep the train going.
- Look at those boxes, barrels, and trunks.
Red, the deal's as good as closed.
Then what are we rushing for?
Come on!
Dump your baggage. Attaboy!
Send it all here.
Come on, quick.
You're slowing up, up there.
You got any trunks up there?
You better throw some butter in, too.
I'm throwing anything you hand me.
I can handle all you got.
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah, pop goes the diesel.
Where are you, Quale?
Send for a Saint Bernard dog.
I'm snowbound.
I guess that will stop them.
I think we hit a cow.
We're off the track.
We're plowing up a farm!
Rusty, it's just like the merry-go-round.
I bet you can't get the brass ring out of the bull's nose.
Come on down.
There's a lovely fire in the living room.
Hurray! We're back on the tracks!
- We need more wood.
- Timber!
Come on.
Too bad that nice new train is all smashed up, Beecher.
- Yeah, I wonder how it happened.
- I wonder.
- Here they come.
- Giddap, there!
I don't see them ahead.
- We need more wood.
- Timber!
Keep to your seat. What's the matter with you? Come on, boy.
Timber!
What happened?
They're catching up!
We'll never make it! Come on.
Swim for it.
Now, ladies and gentlemen... the President of the New York and Western Railroad... will cut the tape, drive the spike... and bank the eight ball in the corner pocket.
Take it away, friends!
We owe you boys a lot.
It shall be your honor to drive the golden spike.

It's hard to grow old in the dust of the prairie
And a man can't grow old where there's women and gold.
The story is told in the dust of the prairie
That a man can't grow old where there's women and gold.
There's a stranger in town where a stranger ain't welcome.
He should take some advice and turn right around.
The stranger should flee.
Go back where he came from.
And live a long life away from this town.
And live a long life away from this town.
Evening, stranger.
You must know everybody in town.
Everybody but one. Don't know you.
You do now.
Got a vacant room?
- By day, week or month?
- I do not know.
Because the way you look at it, a man can't be too sure in this town.
I've been here six years and I ain't dead yet.
I'll settle for a week.
Eight dollars cash in advance.
- From Kansas, eh?
- No.
Always put on where I'm going next so I won't forget.
Room 10 at the end of the hall.
Make your own bed.
Furnish your own towel.
Your grip's where you dropped it.
Thanks for the key.
Seven loses.
All right. Get your bets down, boys.
Get your bets down!
Number seven, the winner.
Get your money down, boys.
The man's getting lucky.
Eleven. The man wins.
Get your bets down.
All right, boys. Cover your bets now.
Eight's your point.
Number eight's your point.
He's my man.
We can take a come bet on that.
Eight the hard way.
No thanks. Here you go, dealer.
Next shoot.
Sometime remind me to tell you how much you mean to me.
Sometime remind me to tell you how happy we could be.
Sometime remind me to whisper each dream, each plan, each promise.
But why wait around for sometime?
Why don't you tell me now?
A whiskey, like you pour it for yourself.
Don't you know it's no fun to drink alone?
Not till after the first one.
You a stranger here?
What kind of whiskey was that?
On the bottle, it says rye.
The way you take it, I don't see what difference it makes.
I'll have another rye.
You haven't answered my question.
I am a stranger everywhere.
Got a job?
Listen, fella. I know that one too.
"Got a job, stranger?"
Not? Why don't you join the army.
Three meals a day and a place to sleep.
"A nice warm uniform..."
It's a little more than that.
Yeah, there's one thing more that I could never take.
It's got second lieutenants.
You want to make this a personal matter, all right?
I don't make it anything, soldier.
You tried to sell me something.
I didn't buy it.
Why don't you beat it?
If I weren't wearing uniform,
I might teach you a few manners.
If you could teach me anything, you wouldn't be in a uniform.
You couldn't be looking for trouble, could you?
- I could, but I'm not.
- That's fine.
Because this is one of the best places west of the Atlantic Ocean to find them.
That was my first impression.
That lieutenant is a nice young boy.
I don't doubt it.
But his mouth is too big.
Like your ears.
The view is much better at this table.
And you must like to pick fights.
Only with second lieutenants.
We like second lieutenants here.
You see here everybody fights except the army.
I wouldn't know.
So anyone who doesn't like the army...
I know what you mean.
But I'm afraid I'll have to come back.
You see I...
I like the way you sing.
Captain Iles, commander of the post.
Mr. Haven, sir.
Lieutenant, I see you finally got here.
I seem to finally get everywhere.
Mrs. Caslon, Mr. Haven.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
You met Mr. Stellman.
It came off beautifully, sir.
He picks a good fight.
Matter of fact.
I think I am still a little sore at him.
- Sit down, Mr. Haven.
- Thank you, Captain.
So you're operating under sealed orders.
All this mumbo-jumbo is characteristic of the Military Information Department.
We try to use it as sparingly as possible.
I've been in this territory for a number of years.
I think you'll find it a little rougher here than the suburbs of Washington DC.
Very sensibly.
Then why is M.I.D. sending you here?
Because two soldiers have been murdered.
Those two soldiers were killed while escorting one of the gold stakes.
Is escorting gold one of the functions of your command?
Young man, the functions of my command look very pretty on paper.
But they are not very practical in a territory like this.
What's happening to the gold?
I permitted it to be stored on a warehouse on the post.
Captain, you're in a bad way.
Wells Fargo won't convoy gold.
You tried and failed. Two men are dead.
Gold's piling up at your post.
You can't move it.
The post is undermanned.
You want the quartermaster's plague to replace 7 uniforms.
Sent to the freight office in West Rim City.
The freight building burned down with the uniforms.
I'm not operating a fire department.
And if I were,
West Rim City is 60 miles away.
- That doesn't concern me either.
- Well what does?
The killing of two soldiers.
They were my men, Haven.
I'm trying every way I know to find out who murdered them.
- So will I.
- It may be harder than you think.
I don't know how you operate.
But this is a dangerous job that can get you killed.
You make it sound very difficult, Captain.
Why don't you just wrap up your flag and take it back east with you?
- Look here, Lieutenant.
- Yes?
How will I know what you're doing?
I'll let you know from time to time.
That's very obliging of you.
One thing. I don't want to visit the army post.
Then report to me through
Mrs. Caslon here.
You can be a friend of her husband.
He owned the Argus mine and died last year.
If that meets with your approval.
Only if it meets with hers.
I'd be delighted to help.
- Is that all?
- Yes, I think so.
He really isn't that abrupt.
- Good night, Mary.
- Good night, George.
- Do you see?
- I see.
I think he secretly likes you.
The commander can certainly keep a secret.
- Would you like a little sherry?
- Only if you'll have some too.
Excuse me.
What mine were the two soldiers trying to convoy gold from?
The Argus. It belongs to me.
That brings me to a question
I'd decided not to ask.
Then I'll answer it first.
Captain Isles has asked me to marry him.
I can understand that.
But you can't understand why Capt. Isles should be involved in the gold business.
I do now.
You must realize there's a lot of gold from all over the territory stored at the post warehouse.
- How much would you say?
- Perhaps as much as half a million.
In fact, I have about
$50,000 in my safe now.
Really? Tell me, who is taking all this the gold?
I don't know. That's the worst part of it, not knowing.
That I might find out.
- Don't get into trouble.
- That's why I'm here.
- I know, but does not get...
- Do not worry it.
Trouble and I are old enemies.
We understand each other.
- Good night, Mrs. Caslon.
- Good luck.
How happy we could be...
Every time I come in here you stop singing. Why is it?
You don't have to come in.
Look, I didn't come back to start a fight. Or break the bank.
Why did you come back?
If you invited me to sit down,
I might find out.
It might be better if you found another table.
And another girl.
Oh no, it wouldn't. I looked.
- Could that be Charlie?
- No.
His eyes follow you around like a couple of flies.
They follow me around to see that strangers don't annoy me.
- Only strangers?
- No one else would be so foolish.
Waiter, bring me a bottle of wine, will you?
First you are beautiful.
Then I like the way you sing.
And now you're a woman of mystery.
I don't want to be a stranger.
So I'll have to be foolish.
- You like to take chances, don't you?
- If I feel lucky.
I advise you to try the dice table.
I'd rather get lucky here.
Every man has a right to his own funeral.
I could be your cousin from Waxaharchie.
His cousin John.
A missionary on his way to China.
So Charlie probably runs the town?
What do you care?
I'm going to spend some time here.
I just like to know who winds the clock.
It's been a nice conversation.
I hate to have it end.
Who is this?
- Mick, this is my cousin John.
- From Waxahatchie.
Cousin John is a missionary on his way to China.
What's keeping him?
I think he's wondering if he couldn't do more good here.
You ain't too friendly, are you?
I like to pick my friends.
You ought to learn not to pick them so easy like you do your cousins.
Ask her.
I never saw him before in my life.
You're too little to make that big a mistake.
You gonna correct me or just bleed at the mouth?
Bring him outside.
- What happened?
- I wanted to be my cousin.
And she hasn't any aunts or uncles.
Good boy, Mick.
Look out!
Kill him, Mick.
- Mick will kill him.
- That's ten to one.
Always bet on the champion.
Then you can only lose once.
Ten to one? I'll take it.
You're down. A thousand to a hundred.
Come on, Mick!
Way to go!
Come on, Mick!
That is, Mick!
It's the first time Mick ever got it.
You done a fine job, stranger.
I can't believe this.
Mick Marian losing a fight and me winning a thousand.
Give it to him, Prince.
In chips.
Care for some coffee?
Yeah. Thanks.
They told me who was fighting.
I was getting ready to rent you a room.
- Sugar or cream?
- Cream.
Myself I'd rather buy a forest fire.
So would I.
When a fights a man because of a woman it means that the woman has made the man bold.
But fighting is no good.
Because it just lead to trouble.
And a man can't grow old where there's women and gold.
No, a man can't grow old where there's women and gold.
Come in.
How do you feel?
Like a million dollars.
You just cost me a thousand.
I brought your hat and coat.
Are you always this sweet to the men who fight over you?
Only the winners.
- Tell me something.
- What?
That fella could have killed me.
Where do you bury the losers?
You talk too much.
What do you want? The next dance?
I think you better sit this one out.
- Have some coffee?
- Yeah, thanks.
The way you run this place, I knew you must be good at something else.
Some folks call me the town poet.
Others, village idiot.
Who am I to question either?
How do you feel today?
Like I crawled from Kansas City.
Figures to make you pretty famous.
A lot of folks have been asking for you already.
- Who?
- That gold mine lady, Mrs. Caslon.
- That's nice.
- Couldn't do better.
And Charlie.
- Charlie?
- No less.
You seem impressed.
Why not?
Charlie owns a piece of everything.
Including the undertaker and the sheriff.
Stage line too?
Everything but the windy Bible class.
Even owns a piece of me.
Gets your money while you're here and makes you pay for leave.
Well, when you get next verse of that song, I'd like to hear it.
I can't find a word to rhyme with "Mick Marion."
- Try "carrion".
- Sure, yeah. Carrion.
Doesn't he ever stopping playing?
Sam? It don't bother him. He's deaf.
Where do I find the boss?
First door. Top of the stairs.
Mick been around?
He's indisposed.
Come in.
- You wanted to see me?
- I did.
- They said Charlie?
- Yes.
You're Charlie?
Right.
This is Prince.
Don't ever gamble with him.
You mean with his equipment?
She means either.
See you later, Charlie.
You surround yourself with very affable character.
It makes me feel at home.
No. You're not that sinister.
Last night you were
Florence Nightingale in silk stockings.
Ouch!
Tell me something.
Why did you start that fight?
- I thought you did.
- Oh, really?
You could have insisted
I was your cousin.
Maybe that's not the way I felt about you.
Why did you get the name of Charlie?
It was my father's.
My name is Charlene.
Charlene? I like that better.
This will be the first time
I ever worked for a woman.
What makes you think you're going to work for me?
You sent for me.
All right. I sent for you.
I was doing a nice quiet little business.
Because everybody was afraid of Mick.
Now every time a man has enough drinks in him to feel rugged, he'll try to do what you did.
- Oh, I wouldn't.
- They will.
It's not the kind of job I want anyway.
I don't intend to start at the bottom.
Been there. It's too crowded.
Where do you want to start?
Where the money is.
What would you do for it?
Anything. Except hang.
- How's this?
- Beautiful.
Where'd you get all this?
From my father.
He taught me one thing.
A lot of men think they can beat the tables.
All you have to do is get a table.
Sometimes they run out of cash and I find myself with new responsibilities.
- Such as?
- A couple of stores.
Naw.
I can't see myself behind a counter.
A sawmill and the logging camp.
The logging camp is a long way from town.
Oh. No.
I own the stage line from here to West Rim City but that's a dud.
- Why?
- Outlaws.
Money went in gold shipments.
Now the mines won't ship it.
I'll take that job.
You mean ride shotgun?
Let me run the line.
What do you expect to get out of that?
A commission on all the gold I get through.
We should buy you a small beer.
Glad to get it.
It's pretty dangerous.
Even Wells Fargo locked up that station and quit trying.
Give me a letter of authorization.
I can't bet against you twice, can I?
- Who steals the gold?
- Who doesn't?
All they have to do is put on a mask and they all look like Black Bart.
I forgot to ask you one thing.
I'm working for you now.
You can ask me anything.
How do I know I can trust you?
You don't.
I can?
Only with money.
Okay, boss?
What's your business with me?
I'm the new manager.
Hey, wait a minute. You're not fired.
I gotta be. There ain't work enough here for one man, let alone two..
Two can loaf as easy as one.
Whitey!
This is the new boss, just took over.
Whitey here runs the freight up to the sawmill.
This is Jim Goddard, the regular stage driver.
- Hello, fellas. I don't need the keys.
- Oh.
I saw that fight last night.
It was sure a beauty.
Let's not talk about that.
Right now, it hurts my hand to listen.
I'm supposed to leave here for the sawmill before daybreak.
Is that all right, Mr. Haven?
- Yeah, I guess that's all right.
- Thank you, sir.
What happened to you?
On my last run, I stopped a bullet.
- Get a good look at them?
- I wish I had.
The only thing here that work.
Son, I wasted my time here.
I might as well waste some advice.
You're full of blood and vinegar.
But this whole thing has got something wrong with it.
Goddard only got a nick in the knee.
You may not be so lucky.
I might depend on something besides luck.
Like what?
On the fact, they don't pay to shoot so straight.
They don't need to when they shoot so often.
Worry it over.
I think I'm gonna need you.
But not on one leg.
Take it easy.
Yes, sir.
- What's all this?
- Something, ain't it?
Yeah. Who's is it?
Miss Charlie's, Mr. Haven.
Where do you drive her?
Same places.
Around the hills, down the river.
- Every afternoon.
- Yes?
I think I'll give you the afternoon off.
I shouldn't let you do this, sir.
But I am.
Miss Charlie may not like this.
I will.
Does this Haven move me out?
Is that the play?
Prince, you know I wouldn't part with you.
I always come up empty.
Not quite.
No.
What's the matter, Prince?
I do not like Haven or anything about him.
You said that before.
What do you know about him?
What do you want me to do?
Have him looked up in the Social Registry?
The man walked in out of nowhere.
And went against your table.
- Did he play like a gambler?
- He knew something.
Yes and he took Mick down.
So he knows how to fight.
You like that part, don't you?
I'll tell you one thing, Prince.
I don't like this part.
You know, Prince,
I always find you in good company.
Stand there a second.
Every time I see you, you look different.
But you always look beautiful.
Why is that?
I always have someone to lie to me.
You can take my hand if you won't squeeze it.
Now tell me what are you doing with my buggy?
It's my work.
I'm the new transportation boss.
You hired me.
Where to?
I'm going to call on a gentleman.
At this hour?
His name is Mark Bristow.
At any hour, it'll be strictly business.
The way you say it, you may need a lawyer.
He's a lawyer himself but it won't help him.
No?
What good is a lawyer if he never gets into court?
Oh? Like a doctor in a graveyard.
Where is this unlucky man?
Across the street.
Whoa, boys!
Think I should take the horses back and give them a rubdown?
Think they've gone far enough?
I haven't.
Maybe you better wait and come in with me.
- Hello, Mrs. Caslon.
- How do you do?
I wonder if you could do me a favor?
Why surely.
It's a big favor.
I wouldn't blame you if you refused.
What is it?
I want to run some gold from your mine.
That is a big favor.
I know it seems impossible to you.
But that's one reason I'm here.
To find out what makes that impossible.
Isn't that very risky?
That's why I couldn't go to anyone but you.
I'm just wondering if we shouldn't speak to Captain Iles first?
You know what he would say.
I'd advise against it.
I suppose so.
But if it works my way, it might clear everything up.
For everybody. And for Iles too.
The War Dept does not like all that gold around an army post.
- Well, I...
- We're working too much in the dark.
This may be the only way to see something.
Who else will know this?
Just us. That's all.
And that's the idea.
I'll arrange it.
Good.
Don't look so grim.
It's only your gold and my skin.
And smile when you walk away.
As though we'd been talking about what a dry summer it's been.
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.
Charlie, you know how I've always cooperated as much as possible.
But I haven't the money.
These are all your notes for gambling.
You're out $6,000.
You want to count them?
No.
Your credit is over, Mark.
My luck can change, can't it?
Not in my tables.
I have seen others fall into the trap.
But I didn't think it would get me.
Nobody does.
I'll have Prince come in and look over your books.
Maybe we can work something out.
- But...
- That's the way it is, Mark.
I pay off on the line.
And I expect to get paid.
Oh. What brings you here?
Oh I had a dream you'd be back here tonight.
Why?
Maybe because took the keys.
Don't they go with the job?
You know how it is with a dream.
I got the crazy idea you were gonna try something.
- Like what?
- Well like maybe running a shipment.
And then what happened?
I wanted to be some help with it.
All right. You've been some help.
Now go on back to sleep.
And I'll finish the dream for you.
I'm riding with you, Haven.
I'm riding shotgun.
You got more more than your leg hurt, didn't you?
Maybe I just like to ride in the moonlight if nothing happens.
And if it does?
Then I figure I've got a better right to be there than you have.
All right. Get up there.
We'll go out the back way.
Hold it there.
Hold those horses!
Ho.
Keep your hands away from your guns.
Get down from there and stand aside.
All right, you. Get down.
Bring up the pace horse. Hurry it up.
Get over there.
Bring it up here.
Keep em up.
Take it easy.
They hang you just the same.
All right, Goddard. Get moving.
Go on!
Keep em up.
That's far enough.
Turn around.
This certifies that the bearer, James Goddard, is operating as a legally deputized... detective... for Wells Fargo stage and express company.
Get out!
Where's Joe?
Something's gone wrong, Pete.
Yeah.
I know one thing.
He was born on a horse.
And he didn't just fall off this one.
Go look for him.
- Hello, Whitey.
- Hello, Mr. Haven.
What are you hauling?
This is a load of grub for the sawmill.
How'd you like to ride my horse back to town?
What about the wagon here?
I'll finish the haul.
You're the boss.
Anything exciting happen in town?
I don't know, Mr. Haven.
I left town before daybreak.
Take it easy with Amber. He's tired.
I'll give him good rub then.
Hey you!
Did you see if a rider coming up?
No.
You sure?
I haven't even seen a lizard.
Where can I put this stuff?
Where did you put it before?
I didn't. I'm a new driver.
I think it's grub.
Take them over to the cook shack.
Ho! Hey, you the cook?
No, I just wear this hat to keep the flies off my hair.
It don't matter to me, brother.
I only haul this grub.
I'd just as soon haul it back to town.
Well, take it around the corner.
Well. Any luck?
No sign of Joe. But there's tracks of another horse circling the mill.
That's bad.
Let's go take a look at that new driver again.
Hey, driver!
You, come here.
You sure you didn't see no rider?
Look. You want me to say
I saw a rider, I'll say it.
I'll say I saw a ghost.
It doesn't make any difference to me.
When did you get this job?
Yesterday.
What for?
It's the system.
If I don't work, I don't eat.
I never found any way to beat it.
Who hired you?
Look. I'm working. I high haul this stuff out here.
Nobody tells me where to dump it.
Everybody wants to know where I've been and what I haven't seen. I don't know!
I get 30 cents an hour. How smart does that have to make me?
Forget it.
I got a load for you to take in when you're finished here.
- Sure.
- How soon?
I haven't eaten anything but dust since daylight.
All right. Grab it quick.
What do you think?
We risk him. That's all.
Here. Work on this stuff.
How about a handout?
Help yourself.
Looks pretty good.
It oughta be.
Used to cook for 600 men a day.
Where was that?
Leavenworth.
Who's the boss around here?
I am.
I mean the whole works.
You talked to the man when you came in.
That real tough-looking fella?
They're all tough when they get to Mick Marion.
Mick come around here very often?
Last night.
It looked like somebody got to him.
How's that?
His face all beat up.
Like your knuckles.
No. I had bad luck with a crate of cauliflower.
That's what he brought up here.
A cauliflower face.
Do you fight him?
Mick?
Do I look like I would?
Just the knuckles.
Say you, driver, hurry up.
I'll be right out.
Not many hands here, are they?
All up at the logging camp.
Well, hi-dee-ho.
Much obliged.
This was real fine Mulligan.
I make it better with cauliflower.
It is good, isn't it?
Maybe this ain't such a good idea.
You, come over here.
- Do you see this box?
- Yeah.
It goes to Prince.
You know who Prince is?
- No.
- He runs things for Charlie.
- Do you know who Charlie is?
- Sure.
All right. Get up there.
Oh, one thing.
The gearbox you're hauling in has got to be repaired.
You tell Charlie if it ain't repaired, we might have to shut down quick.
- You got that?
- I got it.
All right. Then get out of here.
Draw the blinds, Bristow.
Light it up.
Can't you put that gun away?
I can but it helps to quiet my nerves.
- A drink?
- No.
We had given you up for dead.
- Who?
- Who?
Why... everybody.
They found Goddard's body.
Didn't you know?
What happened?
Sit down.
If you're trying to imply that you frightened me coming here, you're quite right.
I am neither a hero nor a fool.
They killed Goddard.
Why didn't they kill you?
Someone wanted me alive.
What for?
I don't know.
What do you want from me?
I'm gonna make a statement that you will write and notarize.
Is that all?
Yeah.
You'll put it away where it can't be stolen or tampered with.
- I have a safe.
- I can see that.
Meaning you don't trust me?
I do.
I just don't think you trust yourself.
Where do you want it put?
Mrs. Caslon has a safe. A nice fat one.
I think I can arrange it.
All right.
Here's the statement.
I solemnly swear, that on Thursday last, about 11 pm, the stagecoach I was driving was held up by five armed bandits.
The gold I was hauling was stolen, and Jim Goddard, the guard, was murdered in cold blood.
Are you sure it was Haven you met?
I know my own boss.
Go in and get a beer.
Haven's wagon's across the street.
He must be back in town.
Now I'm wondering what
I get out of this?
Charlie is holding $6,000 of your IOU's.
You're busted.
This will get you even.
And now you wonder why we just don't take all that gold and go around the world.
Monte Carlo, the Taj Mahal...
I've a better idea for you.
Find the gold yourself.
Plant the deposition.
And let me hang for it.
Then you'd be rich. And you won't even need to travel.
That might take some doing.
And some nerve.
- Where do I sign?
- Here.
Don't get so excited.
I'm perfectly calm.
And I'm asking you calmly
How could you allow that scoundrel to transport gold from your mine when you
The man you call a scoundrel may be dead at this moment.
He may be in town at this moment, where in fact he is.
How could you do such a thing without telling me?
I only did it for your sake.
- My sake?
- He represents the US government.
- And who do I represent?
- I was only...
And while we're on the subject, what was Mark Bristow doing here?
Mark Bristow is my lawyer and you know it.
I'm sorry.
I wish you could see that some times you're a little too sure about too many things.
One nice thing about us is we are always wrong together.
Mark gave me this.
That's why I was here.
You're not going to open it?
"To whom it may concern."
It may concern me.
It does.
Your friend, Mr. Haven, still has your gold.
Those nitwits in Washington.
Sending a demoted lieutenant out here to poke around in my business.
You're getting to be a hard man to deal with.
I'm getting to deal with some hard men.
I'll take care of that.
It looks like a board meeting.
What's he doing with you?
I might I might need a lawyer.
I doubt it.
I realize how seldom legal technicalities annoy you.
- But I think I have one that might.
- What's that?
Just a story.
About a man who are murdered.
A thief who got shot.
And a gearbox I failed to deliver.
Probably no one would believe it unless I had killed for it.
- Who else have you told?
- Only Mark.
He is a lawyer and a notary.
He makes it stick.
He finally gets to court.
I don't know anything. I merely wrote the deposition.
You shut up.
Since you brought your lawyer, ask him if this doesn't sound like blackmail.
He can't think very clearly in the presence of a gun.
But it doesn't bother you?
No. It doesn't.
Pete, go downstairs and watch the stairway.
What you want is a cut.
That's right.
It boils down to this.
We can make a deal and all be very happy together.
How could that be?
When I deliver the gold to you.
You mean the gearbox?
I can even forget I looked inside.
So I stole a gearbox.
I'm still a thief.
- What if he gets them?
- He gets even.
Have you lost your mind?
It was all right when he lost his money.
All right.
Prince will give him the IOU's when the gearbox is delivered.
I think that's all.
Haven, you can stay.
You excuse me, Prince?
You know you roll nice dice.
You bet em jam up too.
But one day you're gonna slip.
When you do, I'll be around to catch you.
You know I think he will.
You should be more careful.
I suppose so.
I won't have to have you killed.
I'd have had you hated it.
So would I.
I'd have missed you too much.
And too long.
Did you ever tell a woman you loved her?
All of them.
How'd you get away?
I was always in the doorway when I said it.
You never said it to me.
Let's get over to the doorway.
Don't move. Turn around.
Put ​​the gold in the wagon.
Is this a holdup?
You want to put it in the wagon?
Now was there something you wanted to say?
Yeah.
I followed one of the bandits here when he cached it.
I couldn't haul it on a horse so I came back with a wagon.
I know that's a lie.
Some of it's true.
But not nearly enough.
All right. I'll try it again.
I cached it there myself.
I was going to give it to them.
I wanted to buy membership in their club.
That was the initiation fee.
You see I thought it was worth it.
Well, you see I don't.
What you're doing may get me in trouble.
If you're still in town in 24 hours,
I promise you will be in trouble.
Now start walking.
Go on.
I thought you were in jail?
I talked my way out.
You are a very glib man.
Can you talk your way out of everything?
- Up to a certain point.
- What's that?
The gun. Some champagne, waiter.
Are we celebrating something?
The first time I talked to you, we had champagne.
Didn't you bring me something?
- No.
- But you will?
- No.
- "No." Just like that?
I went to get it. It was there but... so was somebody else.
Who?
Mrs. Caslon.
Alone?
No, she had a gun with her.
Didn't you have one too?
The one she had was in her hand.
You know this could be that slip you mentioned.
So this nice lady held you up and took the gold. Is that it?
It's like saying I was robbed at Sunday School.
No good, is it?
No.
Mick might've killed you.
But you fought him anyway.
Pete last night had a gun but that didn't scare you.
And now this gentile petticoat waves a gun and you run for your life.
You make it sound very silly.
Or make it sound like what it is.
A lie.
My word doesn't seem to be very good around here.
You've only got one thing that's very good around here.
Some gold.
- Is that all I've got?
- Not quite.
You got some time.
You got two hours to get it here.
And you want me to fatten you up before you have me killed.
- Is that what you mean?
- I said what I meant. Two hours.
You're sweet.
- Well?
- Everything's all set.
- Got enough men at the sawmill?
- Yeah, plenty.
Get back out there.
Get them into uniforms.
We hit the post just before dawn.
I don't know what we've waiting for?
I gave him some time.
He's in the hotel.
He's not doing anything.
I got him some time!
I don't care what he does with it.
- You want your IOU's?
- You mean...
- Why? Did Haven...?
- No, he didn't.
I don't understand.
We don't think they're going to be any good.
I haven't anything to do with it.
- I can still make the good or...
- What?
I can still do business.
Here. Take a look at this.
The deposition. The only copy.
- What do you want?
- Nothing.
All I want to do is get out of it.
I never had any part of it.
- This oughta prove it.
- This?
It's a trick.
I'll see about this.
Haven can't do this to me.
- I'll go and see this.
- Sure. You see about it.
Here, take this along.
Something left to wait for?
No.
- Who is it?
- It's me. Bristow. Let me in.
- Are you going to kill me, Mark?
- You double-crossed me, Haven.
- I did?
- I got the deposition back.
I took it to him.
It wasn't there.
It was just a piece of blank paper.
Don't you laugh at me or I'll kill you.
Well, they want you to, Mark.
And it may be your only out if you do.
But I doubt it.
You know why?
Because even if you took them my scalp, it wouldn't buy your life.
You're in debt. You're broke.
And you're scared.
And you know far too much.
There isn't any way they can use you alive.
Can you think of one?
They're going to do it. I know it.
They're gonna kill me.
Why do they have to kill me?
Us, Mark.
- This must be hers.
- Yes.
She's sweet.
One thing, Mark.
You might get out of town.
Not a chance in a thousand.
You'll do one in a million if it's the only one you have.
Yeah, I might get away with it.
I could try it.
If you do, go straight for your horse.
Don't stop for anything.
I have some important papers in the office.
You haven't anything important left except your life.
And very little time to keep it.
Get on the horse and ride him until he dies.
Then run until you have to crawl and you might be lucky.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Hey, I'm naturally sentimental, being sort of a poet.
Naturally.
I keep a bunch of Jim Cracks.
An old-time sheriff's gun.
A bullet from a dead bandit.
And a rosary from some fellow they hung.
That's nice. A hobby?
Yeah, in a kind of way.
I just wondered if there was something that you wanted to leave me.
The only thing I have.
An army button. Where's the uniform that goes with it?
I might even know.
I think I'll go find out.
Where's your gun?
I dropped it back there.
All right, you, march.
Is that thing loaded?
You try your tricks and you'll find out.
No tricks, sheriff. No tricks.
Hey, go on back. Mick wants you.
What happened to you?
Haven slugged me.
Haven?
Keep him in here.
- Captain Iles.
- Don't apologize. Just barge right in.
- I'll tell you something.
- No, you're not. You're gonna listen.
You lost some uniforms.
You thought they were burned.
- They were burned.
- No, they weren't. But now I do.
But they are now because
I set fire to them.
What?
They are smoldering right now at the warehouse down at the sawmill
There are 70 men down there ready to wear them.
Wear them. What for?
What other reason except to get in this army post and take the gold from you?
Now you're about to send a detachment of men up north on an Indian scare?
- Yeah.
- That Indian scare is a fake.
It's a ruse.
You know where to send them now.
Guess I owe you an apology.
You better go down to the sawmill.
They might try it anyway.
I...
I guess also owe something too.
Only $50,000.
I wish there were something
I could say or do.
There is. You can give me back my gun.
I could give this one to the sheriff.
Tell him to be careful with it.
It's got bullets in it now.
I'll always remember what a fool I made of myself.
I'll always try to forget.
Are you going too?
Not with them.
You caused me an awful amount of trouble.
Yeah, but I finally brought you something.
You didn't think Mark would use that, did you?
Maybe I just wanted to send you a gun.
Maybe.
I have to arrest you.
- Why?
- Murder.
I could have shot just now and I didn't.
I didn't kill the two men or Goddard.
Who did?
Maybe Mick.
- Maybe Prince. Who knows?
- You know.
If you still have the gold, and I think you do, we might make a gift.
I believe every man has a price.
Some men don't believe that.
But woman knows it.
There wouldn't be any women on my jury.
And why you're not as bad off as you might think.
I could find a dozen men who might find you capable of almost anything, but I wouldn't bet they'd vote that way after staring at you through a trial.
Mick is dead for the murders.
Prince can hang for the rest of it.
Isn't it a little late to make any difference?
Maybe not.
Where is Prince?
It's no good.
I'll get someone.
Stay here.
Tell me on the square.
Did you ever love me?
From the first night, from the first time of song.
I tried to get away from it.
But every time, it came back.
Every time I tried it out of my brain,
I just pushed it deeper into my heart.
Say it.
I love you.
I love you.
See you... in China.
The sun shines warm on the dust of the prairie
The sun shining warm but it's heartless and cold it's heartless and cold in the dust of the prairie
And a man can't grow old where there's women and gold.
A man can't grow old where there's women and gold.
Get in there, Luke. Get in there.
That's it.
Giddyap, now. Come on.
- Driver?
- Get in there, Rosie.
Driver, how much farther to this Hasenpfeffer... or whatever you call the confounded place?
Hassayampa?
Oh, shouldn't be long now.
Once over the rise, and round the bend, then along a piece.
We should've been there an hour ago.
Don't suppose we could've passed her, do you, Fink?
Might have, at that.
Don't you worry, soldier boy.
We'll get you there.
"Soldier boy."
What a country.
Forty miles from mudhole to mudhole.
Mule Creek, Deadman's Squaw,
Schmidt's Wells.
Hangman's Flats, Hassayampa.
At the end of the rainbow, Fort Apache.
Fort Apache.
Blast an ungrateful War Department that sends a man to a post out here.
Anyway, I'll be with you.
I hated all those years you were in Europe.
Better there than here.
I didn't mean it that way, Phil.
It's just that after all I've done and been, to be shunted aside like this...
We're coming in.
Practically on schedule. Right, Fink?
Practically.
- Ma Macbean?
- Aye. I'm coming.
- Nice trip, boys?
- Smooth as a rock.
How far is it to Fort Apache?
Oh, the fort's 35 miles south of here.
Were you expected?
- I telegraphed.
- Oh, that.
Telegraphs doesn't mean a thing.
One day the wire's up, the next day they're down.
Thirty-five miles south?
Madam, is there a livery stable here?
No.
There must be some way to rent a vehicle.
- A what?
- A rig. Any kind of rig.
Nothing fit for the lassie to ride in.
Oh, my, that's a real bonny bonnet, miss.
- St. Louis?
- Boston.
- Oh, Boston, Massachusetts?
- Here.
Oh, my.
Oh.
That's mighty pretty, Ma.
Oh, my.
Oh, would you not like a wee cup of tea and get rid of the dust?
Thank you.
If it isn't too much trouble.
Not a bit, lass, not a bit.
Come on. Right in here.
Son, how about a drink?
Gentlemen, I could use one.
Women.
There's your towel.
You'll be as fresh as a daisy.
Thanks, Ma.
Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am. I thought it was Ma.
I beg your pardon, miss.
Who and what are you, mister?
Lieutenant Michael O'Rourke, sir.
En route for duty at Fort Apache, sir.
- Get into uniform, mister.
- Yes, sir.
- Is there another wash-up back here?
- Through the lean-to, sir.
Soldiers.
- Hey!
- Hey, come on inside.
Johnny Reb. Uncle Festie.
Timmy. Uncle Dan.
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
Your manners.
Ho!
Sergeant Mulcahy, with ambulance and escort... for Lieutenant Michael O'Rourke.
Very good, sergeant. At ease.
"At ease," he says. "At ease."
Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey!
- How much you pay for it?
- Seventy-five dollars.
- I could've swiped you one better than that.
- It's tailor-made.
Well, look at the fit. A perfect soldier.
What do you think of it, ma'am?
Wonderful.
Ma'am, this is my godson,
Lieutenant O'Rourke.
Many's the time he's come to me with a wet nose.
Attention!
I am Colonel Thursday.
I presume you have been sent for me.
- No, sir.
- What are you doing here?
Escorting the ambulance from Fort Apache for Lieutenant O'Rourke, sir.
- Have you had no orders regarding me?
- No, sir.
They couldn't have known of your arrival, sir.
That's obvious, mister.
Unless it's the custom at Fort Apache... to provide transportation for incoming second lieutenants... and leave a commanding officer to travel shanks' mare.
You will, of course, sir, accept my ambulance.
Thank you, mister.
- Sergeant, we'll leave in one half-hour.
- Yes, sir.
Get these men a drink and put it on my account.
- We thank the colonel.
- We thank the colonel, sir.
Oh, may I present Mr. O'Brien.
O'Rourke, sir.
O'Rourke. This is my daughter,
Miss Philadelphia.
How do you do?
Your servant, ma'am.
Four bottles of cool beer, Ma.
And I'll have the same with a whiskey chaser.
Halt. Who goes there?
The new commanding officer.
Holy Moses.
No, the new commanding officer.
Attention!
At your ease, gentlemen.
- Thursday.
- Hello, Collingwood.
How do you do, Mrs. Collingwood?
Well, thank you, Owen.
And this must be Philadelphia.
You don't remember me, do you?
Emily Collingwood.
Your mother was my dearest friend.
Why, of course.
Oh, I've heard so much about you.
- We didn't expect you.
- So I see.
Captain York.
I'm Captain York, sir.
I bid you welcome, General Thursday.
I'm not a general, captain.
A man is what he's paid for.
I'm paid in the rank of lieutenant colonel.
I remember you as a general from the war, sir.
Very flattering. Didn't you receive my telegraph, captain?
The wires have been down between here and Fort Grant for two days.
We've had no communications.
Two days? The break should have been repaired.
It's 110 miles to Fort Grant, sir.
I take it this dance is not in my honor.
- It's a birthday dance, sir.
- Birthday? Whose birthday?
General George Washington's, sir.
Shall I show you to your quarters, or will you remain?
Well, under the circumstances, I...
Miss Thursday?
Hi, Dad.
Mickey.
Woman of the house, your son is home.
- Son.
- Hi, Ma.
Oh, how fine you look.
But you're so tall.
Oh, Michael, stand over beside the boy so I can see.
Oh, you're just exactly the same.
Now come over here and sit down and tell me everything.
Gee, Ma, you haven't changed a bit.
Nothing has.
And why would it?
Four years is not so long.
Or did you think to find me grown gray completely?
Woman, I'll leave you alone with your son.
Lieutenant Michael O'Rourke, sir.
Have I the lieutenant's permission to leave, sir?
Sergeant Major O'Rourke has permission.
Thank you, sir.
- Michael.
- God's blessing on you this day.
Boys, I'm not a drinking man, as you know, but there are times.
And tonight, if the sutler's store is still open...
Michael, darling, if it ain't,
I'll kick the door down with my bare fists.
Dad?
Good morning.
It's all right.
There's no one here but me, and I've been up for simply ages.
Oh?
Did you want to see Father or me?
Well, neither, really.
Oh.
I just called to leave my card.
Oh, how nice.
But if you didn't wanna see me...
I mean, if you don't wanna see us... then what do you wanna leave your card for?
- I didn't say I didn't wanna see you.
- Why, you did so.
I asked if you wanted to see Father or me... and you said, your exact words,
"Well, neither, really."
Well, what I meant to say was
I didn't expect to see either of you.
Well, who did you expect to see?
After all, we do live here.
Why don't you sit down?
Good morning, good morning, fair dancing partner.
- Good morning, sir.
- Relax, Mickey.
Got some bad news for you.
You've been assigned to my troop.
"Michael Shannon O'Rourke, lieutenant, United States Army."
Leaving your calling cards already,
Mickey, eh?
He can keep his old cards.
Oh, he can't do that. Protocol requires it.
An officer, upon reporting to a new post... must wait upon his commanding officer at the first possible moment.
He will leave his card.
He will leave an additional card for each lady in the commanding officer's family.
All other officers on the post... will leave their cards at the quarters of the incoming officer, right?
Right. Now do you understand?
- It was just a duty call?
- That's it. Just a duty call.
But there's nothing in the regulations that says an officer's daughter... should receive such cards on her back porch in her nightie.
Pish-tush. This is not a nightie.
It's a dressing gown, isn't it?
- I wouldn't know.
- And I haven't received any cards, anyway.
Well, hand them over to her, Mickey.
Oh, I get it, Miss Thursday.
The lieutenant expected someone to meet him at the door with a silver salver.
- A what?
- A silver salver.
He'd drop the cards in that and hurry away.
You don't happen to have a silver salver, do you?
A silver salver?
Our things haven't even arrived.
Why, last night,
I slept on a horse blanket.
Attention!
Sergeant Major O'Rourke, sir.
At ease.
- Did you say "O'Rourke"?
- Yes, sir.
Place seems to be full of O'Rourkes.
Have the trumpeter sound officer's call.
- Officer's call?
- How long have you been in the Army?
In the United States Army,
15 years, sir.
Then you've heard of officer's call.
Have it sounded.
Yes, sir.
- Derice, sound officer's call.
- Now?
No, next Christmas, you loony.
How long you been in the Army?
Then you've heard of officer's call.
Sound it.
"War Department, Washington, D.C.
Special orders number 687."
One. Lieutenant Colonel Owen Thursday is hereby relieved of his present duties... and will proceed to Fort Apache...
"And upon arrival will assume command of that post. Travel directed..."
And so forth.
"By direction of the secretary of war,
William B. Stafford."
In compliance with these orders,
I take command of the regiment... relieving Captain Kirby York, who has returned to his troop.
Captain Collingwood is relieved of the duties of regimental adjutant.
Returned to his troop.
Lieutenant Gates is appointed adjutant.
At ease, gentlemen.
Gentlemen, I did not seek this command, but since it's been assigned me...
I intend to make this regiment the finest on the frontier.
I fully realize that prolonged duty in a small outpost... can lead to carelessness... and inefficiency, and laxity in dress and deportment.
I call it to your attention that only one of you... has reported here this morning properly dressed.
The uniform, gentlemen, is not a subject for individual whimsical expression.
We're not cowboys at this post... nor freighters with a load of alfalfa.
Mr...
Murphy.
O'Rourke, sir.
Mr. O'Rourke, will you step forward?
Gentlemen, I call your attention to Mr. O'Rourke's dress.
Being fresh from West Point...
Mr. O'Rourke has not forgotten
Army regulations.
I trust my other officers will remember them in the future.
And I will insist they be enforced throughout the command.
Understand me, gentlemen,
I am not a martinet.
But I do want to take pride in my command.
We here have little chance for glory or advancement.
While some of our brother officers are leading... their well-publicized campaigns against the great Indian nations... the Sioux and the Cheyenne... we are asked to ward off the gnat stings and flea bites... of a few cowardly Digger Indians.
Your pardon, colonel. You'd hardly call Apaches "Digger Indians," sir.
You'd scarcely compare them with the Sioux, captain.
No, I don't.
The Sioux once raided into Apache territory.
Old-timers told me you could follow their line of retreat... by the bones of their dead.
I suggest the Apache has deteriorated since then... judging by a few of the specimens
I've seen on my way out here.
Well, if you saw them, sir, they weren't Apaches.
We'll discuss the Apache some other time, captain.
The immediate point, gentlemen, is that I hope to know you all better.
If we don't understand each other now, we soon will.
Questions?
Good morning, gentlemen. You may return to your breakfasts or your other duties.
Captain Collingwood, will you remain?
Go on.
Gentlemen, are there any questions?
If there are none, I intend to follow orders and have breakfast.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Report to your coop.
Sir.
Nothing personal in this, Sam.
No explanations, Owen.
We've never had them before.
- Although, once, I tried.
- There was nothing to explain.
No, nothing.
You did what you did.
Rode to glory.
I did what I did.
Wound up at Fort Apache.
- Well, you've wound up here too.
- Oh, by thunder.
I've not wound up. Not by a jugful.
They've pushed me aside, sent me up to this tenpenny post.
But they'll not keep me buried.
I'll find something.
This isn't a country for glory,
Owen.
I'll take my risks. I always have.
Well, then all I can do is wish you good luck.
And I wish you that sincerely.
Thank you, Sam.
Will you have a drink?
No, thanks, Owen.
It's a little early in the day.
Even for me.
Anything new about my transfer?
- Sorry, sir, nothing yet.
- Thank you.
- O'Rourke.
- Yes, sir?
I require a mount. Have two or three brought over for my selection.
- Yes, sir.
- O'Rourke.
Sir?
This Lieutenant O'Rourke, are you, by chance, related?
Not by chance, sir. By blood.
He's my son.
I see.
How did he happen to get into West Point?
It happened by presidential appointment, sir.
Are you a former officer, O'Rourke?
During the war, I was a major in the 69th New York Regiment.
The lrish Brigade, sir.
Still, it's been my impression that presidential appointments... were restricted to sons of holders of the Medal of Honor.
That is my impression too, sir.
Will that be all, sir?
Yes, sergeant. It will.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, ma'am.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Excuse me. Could you tell me where Mrs. Collingwood lives?
- Oh, right in there, dear.
- Thank you.
- Good morning.
- Philadelphia. Philly.
I was just...
I know it's terribly early to call, but...
Nonsense. Come in, dear.
I'm so glad to see you.
I was just passing and...
My, what a beautiful sideboard.
And those candlesticks.
They were my Aunt Martha's.
I was her favorite niece, so when she died... she left her fortune to a home for stray cats... and the candlesticks to me.
They're lovely.
Everything is.
But our place, it's so bare and so dirty.
- Oh, you poor child.
- And there's no water.
- Mrs. Collingwood...
- "Aunt Emily."
Aunt Emily, what does a woman do in the Army?
Our things haven't...
We haven't even got a coffeepot.
- Do I get someone to help me or...?
- Owen. Owen Thursday. That man.
Now, don't you fret, dear.
In times of trouble, we call on Mrs. O'Rourke.
- Mrs. O'Rourke?
- Mrs. O'Rourke.
Martha, where's Mrs. O'Rourke?
- Mrs. O'Rourke.
- Mrs. O'Rourke.
- Mrs. O'Rourke!
- Oh, yes, what is it?
- Mrs. O'Rourke.
- Oh, yes, Mrs. Collingwood?
Yes, Mrs. Collingwood? Yes?
Mary, this is Colonel Thursday's daughter... and this is Mrs. O'Rourke, the wife of our sergeant major... and the mother of a very fine young officer.
How do you do, Mrs. O'Rourke?
Sam told me about Michael's arrival.
How happy you must be.
Oh, I am.
- How does he look?
- Oh, he looks wonderful.
I mean, he makes a very fine officer.
Mary, this poor child has to set up house in that bare barn.
Don't you worry,
I'll tend to everything.
Well, he is nice.
Order. And one, two, three.
All right, now let's try it together.
Carry arm. One, two, three.
Put that piece on the ground.
Pick it up!
Put that piece down, soldier.
Captain, when you say "carry arm," you mean to carry this little gun?
- Get back in line!
- Yes, sir. I was only asking.
- Shut up and put your hat on!
- Yes, sir.
I'm sorry, soldier.
I was only trying to tell you.
- How's the boy doing, Festus?
- Oh, he's doing fine, Michael.
But nevertheless, he's an officer and a gentleman.
And that's no job for a gentleman.
Well, then...
Come on.
Would Lieutenant O'Rourke please step over to the stable, sir?
But these men, they're pretty rough.
But the sergeants... The sergeants can take over the drill, sir.
Very well.
- Sergeants, continue with the drill.
- Yes, sir.
Now, the first thing to do after becoming a soldier is to look like a soldier.
To look like a soldier, you got to stand like a soldier.
Suck in that belly.
Get that hand out of your pocket.
Straighten up those legs.
Pull those feet out. Get that chin up.
Wait a minute, Daniel, darling.
Just one moment.
I'm gonna make this squad the finest party of men in the American Army.
Get back in line there.
Hold your head up.
Head and eyes straight to the front.
Heels together and your toes apart.
At the approximate angle of 45 degrees.
I've never seen such a ragged line.
Just come out and look at yourselves.
- Get back there.
- Get back there.
Now, is there any man here from Tipperary?
Is there any man here from Cork?
Is there any man here from County Sligo?
Yes, sir.
Now, we don't wanna show any favoritism about this... but you're now an acting corporal.
Now, ahem, Sergeant Shattuck will take you in the manual of arms.
That is, by numbers.
Meaning one, two...
Come on, get back in line there.
Get on your feet. Get in here.
Hello, son.
It's from your mother and myself.
Oh, gee, Dad, he's a beauty.
He's thoroughbred and Morgan.
Get on him, ride him.
Come on.
Hey, Dad, he's a beauty.
He's a leaper, that one.
Go on, take him.
Four. One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two.
There's Sergeant John McAfferty
And Corporal Donahue
They make us march up to the crack
In gallant Company Q
The drums they roll, upon my soul
For that's the way we go
Forty miles a day on beans and hay
In the Regular Army, oh
There's Sergeant John McAfferty
And Corporal Donahue
They make us march up to the crack
In gallant Company Q
The drums they roll, upon my soul
For that's the way we go
Forty miles a day on beans and hay
In the Regular Army, oh
- Those recruits, captain?
- Yes, sir. First day's drill.
They show promise.
A good officer, that O'Rourke.
West Point training, colonel.
Surprise.
Well, what do you think of your new quarters?
Well, did you do all this yourself?
Naturally. Even moved the piano.
No. Mrs. Collingwood and Mrs. O'Rourke helped me.
They were wonderful.
Mrs. Collingwood gave me these things and the drapes... and Mrs. Grayson gave us
Great-Uncle Abraham.
He was a very famous man.
And Mrs. Tompkins gave us that chair, and little Mrs. Bates gave us the stool.
Only it doesn't quite match the room.
And Francisco gave us Guadalupe.
How do you do?
She's our cook.
I'm proud of you.
Someday you're going to be a proper soldier's wife.
And Dr. Wilkens wanted you to have this.
- It's a little rumpsprung...
- What?
But very comfortable.
And I helped with the dinner.
I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you.
It does that sometimes.
Good evening, sir.
I'm sorry to interrupt, but Fort Grant is flashing a general alarm, sir.
Have any of our patrols reported,
Mr. Gates?
No, sir.
Keep the wire open to Fort Grant.
- I'll return to the headquarters immediately.
- Yes, sir.
My cap and gloves.
What's your name?
Guadalupe.
But, Dad, dinner.
Don't wait for me. I may be hours.
There'll be other dinners, Phil.
Yes, Dad.
It's all right, Guadalupe.
We'll cook other dinners together.
- Phil.
- Good evening, Miss Thursday.
- Having a party. I'm terribly sorr...
- No, you come right in, dear.
It's just a little welcome for Lieutenant O'Rourke.
Your servant, ma'am.
Couldn't have come at a better time, could she?
- No one more welcome.
- No, indeed.
Now, then, who shall get this prize?
Our host, of course.
I don't trust you, Sam Collingwood.
No, you shall sit here on my right, next to Captain York.
Thank you.
So Lieutenant O'Rourke can have a look at you.
- Well, I don't know whether that's fair.
- Why not?
- Because you'll have to look at him.
- Well, I hope she does.
- You don't drink wine, do you?
- No, thank you.
- Good girl, Philadelphia.
- Coffee, dear.
Were you born in Philadelphia?
No, Pomfret, Connecticut.
I was named after my mother.
Oh, she was born in Philadelphia?
No, Pawtucket, Rhode Island.
She was named after Grandmother.
Grandmother was the first
Philadelphia in our family.
Oh, then she was...?
No, Provincetown, Massachusetts.
Ahem. Let's ta... Let's talk about horses.
Do you ride, Pawtu...? Po...? Phil?
- Yes, I do.
- Well, good.
We'll have to order some nice young officer to take you riding.
Ahem. Emily.
- Shall we leave the men to their cigars?
- All right.
- Have a cigar, Kirby, and I'll join you.
- Sit down, dear.
I can't tell you how wonderful it is to have you here at the post, Mrs. Collingwood.
Oh. Oh, I think you'll get along even without me.
- Without?
- We're just marking time, you know.
Sam has applied for transfer to West Point as instructor.
Oh, I didn't know.
When are you leaving, captain?
Leaving? Leaving for where?
I'm not going anywhere.
Leave my own party?
Phil meant for the academy, Sam.
Oh, that.
Soon, I hope.
Or they may reject me.
Oh, Sam. Sam, they couldn't.
They've had my application a long time, dear.
You know how the Army is, Sam.
Yes, and I know its opinion of me.
And you know our opinion of you too.
Isn't that enough?
And you know what the men think of you, sir.
Captain, lieutenant, my compliments.
Well then, oh Genevieve
I'd give the world
To live again the lonely past
The rose of youth was dew-impearled
But now it withers in the blast
I see thy face in every dream
My waking thoughts are all of thee
Thy glance is in the starry beam
That falls along the summer sea
Oh Genevieve
Sweet Genevieve
The years may come
The years may go
But still the hand of memory weaves
The blissful dreams
Of long ago
Bravo, Quincannon.
Thank you, Quincannon. Thank you.
One before each meal.
Sergeant, take him back to the guardhouse.
There was sergeant John McAfferty
And Corporal Donahue
This is against all tradition.
A man comes to serenade a lady, and what does he find?
Her husband and half the regiment on the balcony.
- I am crushed.
- You're a faintheart, doctor.
You only serenade when husbands are around.
And for good reason, ma'am.
Seeing what a sorry romantic figure I cut... the husband takes pity on me and brings out his best port.
Oh, good evening, Captain Collingwood.
- This is blackmail, but you'll find the 18...
- I know where it is.
Last time I looked, there were four bottles of '46.
I expect to find my property intact.
- The insolence of the man.
- One, two, three... It's all here.
You are an honorable man.
And since this is an occasion, your glasses.
Come.
Let's drink a toast to the young people.
Miss Thursday.
Mickey.
Then you will go riding with me tomorrow?
Of course.
If you really want me to.
To the colonel's lady and Mickey O'Rourke.
- Here's luck?
- They'll need it, poor darlings.
Attention!
Men... today we gonna put you on the horses.
No more walking.
And by the time we get through with youse... you'll be riding like senators, the all of youse.
And your rough-riding sergeant will be Sergeant Beaufort.
Relax!
Attention.
Gentlemen, this is a horse.
You will observe it has no saddle.
The reason it has no saddle... is because it will be easier for you to stay on without the saddle.
Now, before we progress... did any of you gentlemen serve with the Southern Arms... during the War Between the States?
Yes, sir. I had the pride, sir, of serving with Bedford Forrest.
- I am proud to shake your hand.
- Thank you, sir.
I hope you have the pleasure of buying me a drink on payday.
An honor, sir.
You are now an acting corporal.
- Sergeant...
- Please. Please, Sergeant Mulcahy.
Oh, let them have one.
And now, gentlemen, this gallant soldier... this member of the greatest cavalry force that ever lived... will show you Yankees how to ride.
Attention!
Now you see how easy it is, gentlemen.
Gentlemen, to your horses.
- Who will be the first volunteer?
- I am.
- Come on. Get up here.
- Get him up here.
- A gentleman always remounts. Get up.
- That's it.
Come on, then!
That's it.
Stay on your horses, men.
And if you fall off, get on again.
It's an order in the Army, and a custom... that when you fall off your horses, you mount again like a gentleman.
Stay on that horse.
Get back on your horse.
Get back on that horse right now.
Get back on that horse.
Hey, let go. Hey, get off of him.
Get him off.
Get back on that horse.
- Now, come on, get on that horse again.
- Get up there on that horse.
Hey, come back here!
Where do you think you're going?
Come back here with that horse.
- What's the matter with you?
- Get up there.
- Come on. Get off the horse.
- Stay on him there.
Watch it down there, boys.
Here! Here! Come back here!
- Come on. Get into it.
- There's a boy.
Hey.
Hey, get back up on that horse.
What's the matter?
Knees close together.
Everybody just get right where they...
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Get him up there. Come on.
Stay on that horse, will you?
Take the reins in both hands.
Press in tight with your knees.
Look at the legs on that one.
- One at a time on that horse.
- Hold him.
Watch out, everybody. Now listen to me.
Get that horse.
Sir, I beg to report I lost my Yankee cap.
Thank you, sir. Thank you.
Hey, you, up there straight. Get up.
Thank you, sir. Thank you.
Isn't this wonderful?
What's that over there?
Blue Mesa.
Can't we go there?
Well, it's not as close as it appears,
Miss Thursday.
Are you anxious to return to the fort, lieutenant?
Oh, no, Miss Thursday.
Don't you like the name of Phil, Michael?
Of course I do, Phil.
And right over there, that's where the telegraph line is.
That's our main headache around here.
- Runs from here to Fort Grant.
- You mean, where the smoke is?
Smoke?
Is it an Indian signal?
No, it's not an Indian signal.
The line went dead, sir.
Right in the middle of the last word.
"Meacham reports Diablo's band decamped from reservation.
Last seen headed S-O-U-T..."
South, obviously.
Or southeast or southwest.
Which means they may have crossed
10 miles from here or 200.
- We can't patrol all of it.
- I'm fully aware of that, captain.
Think they're headed for the border to join Cochise?
That's my opinion, sir.
And these are the three main passes to Mexico?
Well, there are others, but those are the ones the Apache use most.
Two of them in our patrol area.
Captain York, you and Mr. O'Rourke take a troop and patrol the area.
- Mr. O'Rourke is not on the post, sir.
- Why not?
- He's out riding, sir, with your daughter.
- He what?
- How long ago? When did they go out?
- Almost three hours past, sir.
- Three?
- Are you sure it's that long?
- Positive, sir.
- Blasted young fool.
O'Rourke, hasn't that idiot son of yours sense to know this country's not safe?
Taking my daughter riding.
Your daughter is as safe with my son as she would be with any man.
How safe is that with the Apaches on the warpath?
Phil, get back!
Collingwood, take out a patrol at once.
York, pass the word to A and B.
Tell them to turn to, full field equipment.
Rations for a week.
Wagon's burned. Two men dead.
Lieutenant Thursday.
Repair wagon, sir, burned.
Two troopers, Barry and Williams, dead.
Spread-eagle on the wheels, roasted.
- And my daughter saw all that?
- Yes, sir.
- I'll take your report inside, mister.
- Yes, sir.
Are you all right, Phil?
Yes, Dad. I'm all right.
Take her inside, will you?
Must have jumped them at sundown.
It was a pretty big party.
Twenty-five or thirty, anyway.
Mescalero Apaches.
I found this.
- Blood.
- Apaches carry off their dead.
It's Mescaleros, all right. Diablo's band.
You say their trail led off to the south?
It headed that way, sir, but...
You didn't follow it long enough to find out?
No, sir. I couldn't take that risk with Miss Thursday, sir.
Your caution, Mr. O'Rourke, is commendable... but somewhat belated.
My compliments on the completeness of this report.
It speaks a knowledge of the savage Indian... which I am sure you did not acquire at the military academy.
I call it to your attention... that in taking my daughter riding without bespeaking my permission... you have been guilty of behavior... more consistent with that of an uncivilized Indian... than an officer and a gentleman.
If I have not made myself sufficiently clear, mister...
I will add this:
You will not again ride with my daughter.
And, for reasons which I feel it unnecessary to go into... you will avoid her company in the future.
But, colonel...
I speak to you not only as your commanding officer... but as Philadelphia's father.
I think I am within a father's rights,
Captain York.
My daughter's life and safety are precious to me.
And to me, sir, I assure you.
Then you will all the more readily bow to my wishes.
Yes, sir.
Now, mister... you say the break was here?
- Yes, sir.
- Excellent.
Send a wagon and a detail to repair the wires and bring back the bodies.
Yes, sir. Sergeant major, assemble a platoon from A Troop.
A platoon? I said a detail, captain.
An officer and four men.
But the Apaches may still be around.
I'm running a command, not a debating society, York.
- Four men. I'll be in command...
- Mr. O'Rourke will be in command.
Mr. O'Rourke in command. Have them take
60 rounds of carbine ammunition per man.
That's a lot for men who've been trained to shoot. Thirty will be ample.
Thirty will be ample.
And 18 per revolving pistol.
You'll call for volunteers.
- With the colonel's permission, I volunteer.
- Permission refused.
Carry out your orders, sergeant major.
You'll leave within the quarter-hour,
Mr. O'Rourke. Questions?
Michael.
You know what's expected of you now?
Sure, Dad, I know.
Derice, go get Quincannon out of the guardhouse. Wait.
O'Feeney, go to the stables and find
Mulcahy, Shattuck and Johnny Reb.
Tell them they're volunteering for a hazardous mission.
Beyond the call of duty.
Tell them their regiment is proud of them.
Now get going.
Come on, come on.
You spoke before of a platoon from A Troop, Captain York.
I suggest you assemble it.
Light marching equipment, but full bandoleers.
We'll leave in 30 minutes.
I'll command, you'll accompany.
- You mean we're gonna trail the wagon?
- At a striking distance.
Collingwood.
You remember the paper that Captain Robert E. Lee wrote... when he was at the Point?
The one on the trap as a military weapon?
I do not share the popular view of Captain Lee's ability as tactician... but that paper impressed me.
Particularly the maneuver that Genghis Khan employed... in the battle of Kinsha in 1221.
You recall...?
- Hadn't you better be moving, captain?
- Yes, sir.
What, no debate this time, captain?
No debate, sir. No questions.
Troop is ready, sir.
You're not properly uniformed, captain.
Nor are your men.
They look like scratch farmers on market day.
Their hats should be creased fore and aft like a fedora.
And I don't like exposed galluses.
Yes, sir.
Move out in a column of twos, captain.
By twos! By the right flank!
Come on. Follow!
Woman, go on about your business.
Uh-oh.
Get busy with the wire, sergeant.
All right, you men.
Get out those blankets.
- And work fast.
- Barry and Williams.
Many a pint I had with both of them.
- Why, you...
- Sergeant!
Johnny Reb, drop it.
Men, let's get out of here. Fast.
- Bugler, raise those colors to full staff.
- Yes, sir.
Meacham.
This looks deserted.
He's here, all right. Meacham!
With the colonel's permission, sir.
The door is open, sir.
- Open the shutters. Get the stench out.
- Yes, sir.
Meacham.
- Well, Mr. York.
- Let's go, Meacham.
By your leave, sir.
Another exile in our wilderness.
Colonel Thursday, our new commanding officer.
Your servant, Mr. Thursday.
- May the Lord...
- Colonel Thursday, Mr. Meacham.
Oh, bless you, I pay no attention to military titles.
I don't believe in titles of any kind.
We're all his brothers, his children.
Even these savages entrusted to my care.
- I feed them and clothe them...
- And fill them full of rotgut whiskey.
I have a license.
Spirits have their uses.
This is not a healthy climate.
Perhaps the colonel would like a drink after his ride.
No? Your health.
Mr. Meacham... a band of Indians has left the reservation.
That's right. That Diablo and 30 others, the ungrateful dogs.
I treat them well.
I have goods for them to buy.
- Knives, calico, wool...
- Cheap, shoddy trash.
No.
Mist... Colonel Thursday, you know how children are.
They like their bright toys.
Winchester seven-shot repeaters are not toys.
Captain York, I am attempting to question Mr. Meacham.
Yes, sir.
Right, sir.
There's no reason, to your knowledge... why a band of Apache should go on the warpath?
Not the warpath.
Misguided maybe, like wayward children.
Mister, two of my troopers are dead.
Tortured to death.
Not by my Apaches.
Some other raiding party, perhaps.
How can you be sure?
We've taken Diablo and his band, what's left of them.
- They'll be here soon.
- You'll keep them here.
You'll assign a troop to keep them here.
That's what I've been telling Mr. York.
I leave it to you.
How can I, one lone man, be responsible for all these savages?
Now you see what's happened.
Two of your men have been killed.
Brave men serving their country, as I am.
This wouldn't have happened if the highhanded Mr. York...
- Oh, you mealy-mouthed...
- Captain York.
Mr. Meacham is a representative of the United States government.
He will be treated with due respect.
- May I say something, sir?
- What is it?
No troop or squadron or regiment's gonna keep the Apaches on this reservation... unless they wanna stay here.
Five years ago, we made a treaty with Cochise.
He and his Chiricahuas and some of the other Apache bands... came on the reservation.
They wanted to live here in peace, and did for two years.
And then Meacham here was sent by the Indian ring.
That's a lie. I'd been...
The dirtiest, most corrupt political group in our history.
Then it began. Whiskey, but no beef.
Trinkets instead of blankets.
The women degraded, the children sickly, and the men turning into drunken animals.
So Cochise did the only thing a decent man could do.
He left. Took most of his people and crossed the Rio Bravo into Mexico.
- He broke his treaty.
- Yes.
Rather than see his nation wiped out.
The law's the law, and I demand that you soldier boys enforce it.
Any demands you wish to make... you will make through official channels, Mr. Meacham.
Do not again employ that word in my presence.
- No offense, sir. No offense.
- Ready, sir.
- Lead the way. Come along, sir.
- Where?
- To your storehouse.
- There's nothing in there.
Here, sir.
- Mister... Colonel Thursday, I protest.
- Put it in writing.
- What's in these boxes?
- It's marked "Bibles," sir.
- That's all it is...
- Open them up.
What's this scale used for?
Weigh government beef rations.
I seem to have gained 75 pounds since I came to Arizona.
Bibles, sir.
Sergeant, pour me some scripture.
What's in this, brimstone and sulfur?
You know what it is.
I'm entitled to keep it.
Your license may permit you to keep medicinal whiskey... but this is no whiskey.
- You're not used to frontier whiskey.
- I don't know. I've tasted most everything.
Sergeant, you a judge of whiskey?
Well, sir, some people say I am, and some say I'm not, sir.
Tell me what you make of this.
Well... it's better than no whiskey at all, sir.
- Strike a match.
- Yes, sir.
Since it doesn't appear to be whiskey... and since it seems to be of highly inflammable and dangerous liquid...
I find there's only one thing to do,
Mr. Meacham: destroy it.
I protest. I'll write Washington.
I'll have you busted.
Mr. Meacham, you're a blackguard, a liar, a hypocrite... and a stench in the nostrils of honest men. If it were in my power...
I'd hang you from the nearest tree, leave your carcass for the buzzards.
But as you are a representative of the United States government...
I pledge you the protection and cooperation of my command.
Good day, sir.
What about these Winchesters, sir?
The pins are bent. Sergeant Mulcahy, straighten them with this.
You heard what he said.
Destroy it.
"Destroy it," he says.
Well, boys... we've a man's work ahead of us this day.
Unlock the door.
- Michael...
- Prisoners, outside.
Michael.
Private Mulcahy.
Private Shattuck.
Private Quincannon.
And Private Beaufort.
I'm ashamed of you, the whole of youse.
You're a disgrace to your regiment.
If there was a regulation for it,
I'd make you take the tippler's oath.
Michael.
Volunteers for the manure pile.
Left face.
Take them out of here.
Hip! Hip! Hip! Hip! Hip!
Now all together, men.
There was Sergeant John McAfferty and...
- Oh, shut up!
- Shut up.
Hip! Hip! Hip! Hip! Hip!
Hip! Hip! Hip! Hip! Hip!
Assuming you found Cochise... would he listen to you, would he believe you?
Cochise knows me, sir.
I've never lied to him.
And if you can assure him decent treatment for his people...
I'll confess he interests me.
And these Eastern newspapers...
I hadn't realized Cochise was so well-known.
Oh, he's known.
He's had the laugh on every troop in the Southwest these three years.
Six campaigns, he's outgeneraled us, outfought us, and outrun us.
That's just the point, sir.
There aren't enough troops in the whole territory to make Cochise come back.
But one man, a man he trusts, might persuade him.
A carbine against his spine might be more persuasive.
Well, I'll go in unarmed, sir.
Can't fight my way in.
Either walk in or...
A man who brought Cochise back...
I'm for it, captain.
How many men will you need?
One, sir. Sergeant Beaufort.
- "Private Beaufort," sir.
- Why him?
He speaks Spanish, so does Cochise.
My Apache has its limits.
Shouldn't you take another officer instead?
- Sergeant Beaufort was a...
- "Private Beaufort," sir.
Private Beaufort was a major in the Confederate Army.
An aid to Jeb Stuart.
I remember Cadet Stuart.
- Quite.
- He was...
Were you saying something, captain?
I said, "Quite," sir.
I'd like to leave at once, if the colonel has no questions.
- What?
- Questions, sir?
No, no questions.
Proceed, captain. Take your ex-rebel.
- Thank you.
- That is all.
- Ready, Sergeant Beaufort?
- Yes, sir.
- Anything is preferable to shoveling...
- That's what I thought.
Well, here we go.
Private Mulcahy.
My compliments, sir.
Officer's pet.
Officer's pet, that's what he is.
How's your hangover?
Sir, you're the nicest Yankee I've ever known.
Well, let's go.
Quincannon, if that's you, you can wait till payday. I'm not gonna...
Oh. Having dinner?
Well, yes, I will have a cup of tea.
And if you urge me,
I may even take a piece of pie.
Good evening, lieutenant.
I haven't been seeing much of you lately.
Please don't stand.
- Phil... Miss Thursday, I...
- I had hoped you might call.
You did leave your card, didn't you?
This is your card, isn't it?
Isn't it proper,
Sergeant Major O'Rourke... for an officer to call after he's left his card?
It would be, except that...
The colonel has forbidden me to address you, Miss Thursday.
But you are addressing me, aren't you, lieutenant?
And if a young man hasn't enough gumption... to address a young woman who, even if her father is a colonel, well...
I don't think he's as brave as I think he is.
- Do you, Mrs. O'Rourke?
- No, I don't.
Ma'am, your father is
Michael's commanding officer.
His orders will be obeyed.
Miss Thursday,
I'm afraid you'd best leave us.
Michael O'Rourke.
Sit down, dear.
And you sit down yourself.
And you, have you nothing to say?
Or have you learned your manners from this big bull of a man?
There's much I'd say, if I could get a word in edgewise.
Miss Thurs...
Miss Thursday...
If I had any thought that it really mattered to you whether I spoke to you or not...
But I couldn't believe you felt the same way about me.
And what way was that, lieutenant?
Well, I...
Miss Thursday, if you'll just step outside...
The colonel, he come.
He very angry.
He know she here.
Come, Philadelphia.
I'm here to bring you home.
I'm not ready to leave, Father.
I've been invited to dinner.
Won't you stay, colonel?
Thank you, Mrs. O'Rourke.
Another time, perhaps.
Well, at least allow me to take your hat?
I beg your pardon. Come, Phil.
Colonel Thursday, sir, I would...
Mr. O'Rourke, I want no words with you at this time.
- But, colonel, sir...
- You heard me, sir.
Now get out of here before I say something I may regret.
This is my home, Colonel Owen Thursday.
And in my home I will say who is to get out and who is to stay.
And I will remind the colonel that his presence here, uninvited... is contrary to Army regulations... not to mention the code of a well-mannered man.
Dad, please.
Colonel Thursday, sir, what I've been trying to tell you, sir... is that I love your daughter.
And I ask her now, in your presence, to be my wife.
Yes, Michael.
I see.
- Philadelphia, I ask you to reconsider.
- No, Father.
I tell you, this is not a proper or suitable marriage for you.
I can't believe that.
Sergeant Major O'Rourke, you will pardon me for speaking bluntly.
But as a noncommissioned officer, you are aware of the barrier...
- Between your class and mine.
- I am, sir.
But Michael's an officer.
Not that it makes any difference.
It makes a difference in the Army, Phil.
The sergeant major knows that, and his son should know it.
The Army, sir, is not the whole world.
No, but it's your world, and your mother's world and my world.
I'm not as young as I once was.
With the colonel's permission...
- I'll put in for retirement.
- That won't be necessary, sergeant major.
Nor need you, mister, give up your profession.
My daughter is not of legal age.
She cannot marry without my consent.
I'll be of age in two years.
Sergeant major, I beg your pardon for entering your quarters without invitation.
Mr. O'Rourke, your pardon for my words.
Come, Phil.
I'm not a child, and I love Michael.
I'll arrange at once for your return to the East.
You'll have two years to forget each other.
Mrs. O'Rourke... my respects, ma'am.
- Ready?
- Ready.
Put the beer right back there on the table, boys. One on each end.
Come on, step lively, step lively.
Krausmeyr, one sour note out of you tonight and back you go shoeing horses.
The same goes for you, Derice.
Now you've got your stripes back...
I expect you to be on your best behavior and set a good example for the men.
Oh, don't worry, Michael, my darling.
We'll be the models of decorum.
Now, where's the punch?
- Mulcahy, I...
- Michael.
Mulcahy, you'll not be spiking the refreshments this year like you did last.
Oh, just one bottle.
- No, sir...
- Michael.
Go on, the whole of youse.
- Good evening, O'Rourke.
- Good evening, doctor.
And Mrs. O'Rourke.
- It's a fine night for a dance. Clear and dry.
- Yes, sir.
- Which reminds me...
- Right over there, sir.
- Good evening, O'Rourke.
- Good evening, sir.
- And Mrs. O'Rourke.
- Good evening.
Oh, sergeant major, you have no idea how
I've been looking forward to tonight.
I'm forever telling the captain... that it's the noncommissioned officers' dance that is the nicest dance.
Don't you think so, Mrs. O'Rourke?
- Well, of course I do.
- And, sergeant major...
- ...will you please claim me for a dance?
- With the greatest of pleasure, ma'am.
- By the way, I...
- Right over there, sir.
Thank you, Krausmeyr.
Again, on behalf of the officers of Fort Apache...
I wish to thank the noncommissioned officers and their ladies... for this grand party.
The food is exquisite.
And the punch, wow.
Good evening, Krausmeyr.
And so, as is customary at Fort Apache... the commanding officer,
Colonel Owen Thursday... will lead out the wife of our sergeant major... the charming Mrs. Michael O'Rourke.
With your permission...
Mrs. O'Rourke, may I have the honor?
It will be a pleasure, Colonel Thursday.
And now, Sergeant Major O'Rourke will lead out the colonel's lady... in this case, his lovely daughter,
Miss Philadelphia Thursday.
And now, ladies and gentlemen... quickly take your partners for the grand march.
- My pleasure, miss.
- Thank you.
Get out of my way, Meacham, or I'll break both your legs.
Of course, with your permission.
Walk him around, then rub him down, will you, son?
Captain York.
Sir.
- Well?
- Cochise has crossed the river, sir.
He's coming in with all his people, wants to talk peace.
- He's returned to American soil?
- Yes, sir.
Now, with the colonel's permission...
I'd like to shake some of this Mexican adobe dust and get back to the dance.
There'll be no time for that.
The regiment moves out at dawn.
The regiment?
Cochise says he'll meet with you and me and Meacham.
We'll take a small detail and go unarmed.
I've arranged a rendezvous this side of the Dragoons.
Sergeant major, you'll stop the dance.
Pass the word to the first sergeants, prepare their troops to march at dawn.
Troop commanders will meet at headquarters at once.
Colonel, if you send out the regiment,
Cochise will think I've tricked him.
Exactly. We have tricked him.
Tricked him into returning to American soil.
I intend to see that he stays here.
Colonel Thursday,
I gave my word to Cochise.
No man is gonna make a liar out of me, sir.
Your word to a breechclouted savage?
An illiterate, uncivilized murderer and treaty-breaker?
There's no question of honor, sir, between an American officer and Cochise.
There is to me, sir.
Captain York... you may have commanded your own regiment in the late war... but so long as you command a troop in mine, you will obey my orders.
You have your instructions, sergeant major.
Ladies and gentlemen... officers and noncommissioned officers, your attention, please.
By order of the commanding officer... this night's entertainment will conclude with the playing of the next dance.
After the dance, all first sergeants... quartermasters, saddler sergeants, farriers, cooks and bakers... report to me at headquarters.
Ladies and gentlemen... the noncommissioned officers of Fort Apache... offer their deep regrets.
And on their behalf, I wish to thank you for attending this dance.
Krausmeyr, if you please.
Is it to your taste, Johnny, darling?
Column of fours.
- First troop, fours left.
- Fours left.
Fours left.
Ho!
Fours left.
Ho!
I'm lonesome since I crossed the hill
And over the moor and valley
Such heavy thoughts my heart do fill
Since parting with my Sally
I seek no more the fine and gay
For each does but remind me
How swift the hours did pass away
With the girl I've left behind me
I seek no more the fine and gay
For each does but remind me
How swift the hours did pass away
With the girl I've left behind me
Mrs. Collingwood. Excuse me, ma'am.
It's Captain Collingwood's transfer, ma'am.
It just came through.
Oh, run. Run or send someone after.
Call him back.
Yes, Aunt Emily.
- I don't know.
- What is there to know? Go get him.
Sam's no coward. He never was.
Who's talking about cowardice?
Don't be a fool, woman.
Tom, get mounted.
Go bring Captain Collingwood back.
No.
- Keep this for the captain's return.
- Yes, ma'am.
I can't see him.
All I can see is the flags.
Squadron, halt!
It's the encampment, sir.
Must be about a mile up.
Three hundred wickiups or more.
Very good.
Bugler, my compliments to Captain York.
- Have him report to me.
- Yes, sir.
Yes?
Is that approximately where you were to meet Cochise, captain?
Just about.
My officers will address me as "sir,"
Captain York.
Yes, sir. Will that be all, sir?
It will not.
I propose to deploy the men, two troops to the north, one to the east.
- We will then converge on the encampment.
- I wouldn't do that, sir.
I'm not asking your advice, captain.
I'm merely stating.
The Apache, sir, are neither to the north nor the east.
Nor are they in their encampment.
But if you'd have been watching the dust swirls to the south like most of us... you'd see that they're right there.
That's Alchesay.
They outnumber us four to one.
Do we talk or fight?
You seem easily impressed by numbers, captain.
However,
I'll honor your word to Cochise.
Tell him we've come to talk.
Ride on!
Gentlemen, I have the honor... to present the great hereditary war chief of the Apache nation, Cochise.
Get on with it, captain.
Take over, Beaufort.
Good afternoon.
Gentlemen, this is Alchesay, head of the White Mountain Apaches...
Satanta of the Mescaleros... and the Chiricahua medicine man... named Jerome in our language, but in Spanish, Geronimo.
Well, time to get on with it, Beaufort.
- What's he saying?
- That the Apaches are a great race, sir.
They've never been conquered.
But it is not well for a nation to be always at war.
The young men die.
The women sing sad songs.
And the old ones are hungry in the winter.
And so I led my people from the hills.
And then came this man.
- What did he say?
- Well, sir... a free translation would be that
Meacham's a yellow-bellied polecat... of dubious antecedents and conjectural progeny.
Cochise's words, of course, sir, not mine.
That's a matter of opinion.
He is worse than war.
He not only killed the men... but the women... and the children... and the old ones.
We looked to the great white father for protection.
He gave us slow death.
We will not return to your reservation... while that man is there... or anyone like him.
Send him away and we will speak of peace.
If you do not send him away... there will be war.
And for each one of us that you kill...
- 10 white men will die.
- Are you threatening us?
- Don't interrupt. It's an insult.
- I'll not be threatened. Beaufort.
No preliminary nonsense with him, no ceremonial phrasing.
Straight from the shoulders.
Do you hear me?
They're recalcitrant swine.
They must feel it.
He's only speaking the truth, sir.
Is there anyone in this regiment that understands an order?
- What does the colonel wish me to say?
- Tell him I find him without honor.
Tell him they're not talking to me but to the United States government.
Tell him that government orders them to return to their reservation.
And tell him if they've not started by dawn, we will attack. Tell him that.
Bugler... sound forward.
Forward.
Forward. Ho!
Forward, ho!
I don't see them. Not a one.
Well, they're down there, sir, among the rocks.
- Have you seen them, captain?
- I don't have to. I know.
- How?
- Because if I were Cochise... that's where I'd take up position.
And that dust cloud beyond?
It's an Apache trick. Probably squaws and children dragging mesquite.
Very ingenious, captain.
You make me suspect your Cochise has studied under Alexander the Great... or Bonaparte, at the least.
March your troops.
We'll charge in a column of fours.
Mounted in fours?
That's suicide, colonel.
- I tell you, they're down there.
- York!
Captain York, you're relieved of command of your troop.
There is no room in this regiment for a coward.
At your service, sir.
- Bugler, pick up Captain York's gauntlet.
- Yes, sir.
I'm no duelist, captain.
I will decide whether I will answer you with pistols or a general court-martial.
You will remain on the ridge, in safety, with the supply train.
Take O'Rourke with you.
Gentlemen, you have your orders.
Are there any other questions?
Captain Collingwood?
No questions, Owen.
Gentlemen, join your troops.
A charge. Mounted in fours.
- They're madmen.
- And I'm to stay with the wagon train.
And take O'Rourke with me.
You'll find Lieutenant O'Rourke with his troops, sir.
And thank you.
Good luck.
- Good luck, men.
- Thank you, sir.
Lieutenant O'Rourke, follow me.
- But the troops, sir...
- Don't argue.
- Mulcahy, take over.
- Captain York...
Get out of here, you scut, or I'll put you across my knee and belt the pants off you.
Get out now.
As you were, men.
Good luck be to you.
Wheel the wagons.
Get them on the ridge.
Come on, get the horses up behind there.
Come on. Get them over there.
Get those teams off.
All right, break out the picks and shovels.
Come on. Get them over there.
- Come on.
- Get them unhooked.
Carry on, boy.
What are you doing, man?
- All right, get them over.
- Come on. Get it over. Let's go.
- Get her over.
- Get her over.
All right, come on. Lean it over.
Lean it over there. Let's go.
Turn it over.
Mickey.
Lean it over. Let's go.
Turn it over.
Get to Fort Grant.
Tell them where we are.
Tell them we may still be alive if they hurry. Move.
And marry that girl!
Trooper.
Stand by your guns, men.
Stand by your guns.
Flarety, you're in charge.
I'll be back.
We've dug in on the ridge, sir.
Plenty of water and ammunition.
I sent a courier to Fort Grant, if we can only hold out.
Here, get on my horse.
I'll trouble you for your saber, captain.
My saber?
I must rejoin my command.
The command is wiped out, sir, and there's nothing we can do about it.
I'm not asking your opinion,
Captain York.
When you command this regiment, and you probably will, command it.
Your saber, sir.
Any questions, captain?
No questions.
This time, you were late, Owen.
You have my apologies.
Sergeant Major O'Rourke, my apologies, sir.
You can save them, sir, for our grandchildren.
Hold your fire, men.
Hold your fire.
However, gentlemen, I warn you, this may be a long campaign.
It may be weeks before you have any headlines for your newspapers.
If we catch Geronimo, that will be headline enough.
And more glory for your regiment.
He must have been a great man.
And a great soldier.
No man died more gallantly... nor won more honor for his regiment.
Of course, you're familiar with the famous painting of Thursday's charge, sir.
Yes, I saw it when last in Washington.
That was a magnificent work.
There were massed columns of Apaches in their war paint and feather bonnets... and here was Thursday, leading his men in that heroic charge.
Correct in every detail.
He's become almost a legend already.
He's the hero of every schoolboy in America.
But what of the men who died with him?
- What of Collingworth and...?
- Collingwood.
Oh, of course, Collingwood.
That's the ironic part of it.
We always remember the Thursdays, but the others are forgotten.
You're wrong there.
They aren't forgotten because they haven't died.
They're living. Right out there.
Collingwood and the rest.
And they'll keep on living as long as the regiment lives.
Pay is $13 a month.
Their diet, beans and hay.
Maybe horsemeat before this campaign is over.
Fight over cards or rotgut whiskey, but share the last drop in their canteens.
Faces may change... and names... but they're there.
They're the regiment.
The regular Army.
Now and 50 years from now.
They're better men than they used to be.
Thursday did that.
He made it a command to be proud of.
- The command is formed, sir.
- Thank you, sergeant major.
And now it's time to move.
- Questions, gentlemen?
- No.
Thank you very much, colonel.
Gentlemen, this is my adjutant,
Lieutenant O'Rourke...
- ...who will take care of you.
- Gentlemen.
Mrs. Michael O'Rourke,
General Thursday's daughter.
- How do you do?
- And the Mrs. O'Rourke.
It's a pleasure, ma'am.
And this is
Michael Thursday York O'Rourke... the best man in the regiment.
Aren't you, you scut?
Forward face.
Ho!
I'm lonesome since I crossed the hill
And over the moor and valley
Such heavy thoughts my heart do fill
Since parting with my Sally
I seek no more the fine and gay
For each does but remind me
How swift the hours did pass away
With the girl I've left behind me
Here come somebody.
That must be Bill Doolin.
That ain't Doolin, he couldn't ride like that if you tied him on.
Morning boys.
Well, what's the matter? Didn't you've yet see a girl before?
- Who are you?
- Name Cheyenne.
Bill Doolin sent me, he's my uncle.
Been riding since 2 this morning... so I'll answer any other questions over a cup of coffee.
- I've heard Bill speak of you.
- Thanks.
- But I thought you were just a little kid.
- Well, I was once.
I'm John younger, this my brother Jim, that's Cole back there.
You're Billy the kid, you must be Yeager... and the Sundance Kid, uncle Bill told me about you.
What's Bill got on his mind?
He didn't explain nothing in his letter.
Oh, he will when you see him. Right now, he's got his eye on a little bank in Braxton.
That's why he sent me instead of coming himself.
You mean we rode all the way out here just to knock over a small town bank?
Is only the beginning, the whole new territory he's after.
Right now, we want to get this bank for a stake before it moves.
We've been watching, everybody is closing out their accounts, chucked full of cash.
- Wait a minute, you've said we.
- That's right, any objections?
Yeah, busting banks is men's work.
- Belle Starr did all right.
- You ain't Belle Starr.
Suppose you make your complaints to uncle Bill.
- Did he figure you in on this?
- Of course, we got it all worked out.
Is all right with
Doolin is all right with us.
- This is his show Sundance.
- Let's go then, all that's going.
Would be a pleasure.
What's all the commotion down there Cheyenne?
All the ranchers have to move out too, that place belongs to a man named Vance Cordell.
Read in the paper where he's having an auction.
Vance Cordell, I know that name.
Uncle Bill said he used to be a Texas ranger.
- That's it, now I remember.
- A friend of yours?
Not exactly.
This is your only legal chance to steal this herd of cattle here from Mr. Vance Cordell.
And is burglary my friends, highway robbery and you can do it without using a gun.
All right now, what am I offered for this herd of cattle here?
The finest cattle, the finest herd north of the panhandle.
All right, what am I offered? What am I offered?
Oh, don't stand out there with blank faces, say something.
What am I offered here?
How much will you give me a head?
16 dollars.
16 dollars, that's kind of a weak start brother but at least is a start anyway.
All right, 16 I've got, do I hear 20?
We better get away from here before he talks me into bidding on my own cattle.
Well, if he gets them up to 25 dollars a head I'll be satisfied.
- Will you?
- Sure, that's a fair enough price.
I don't mean that Vance. I mean will you be satisfied living away from here?
You know what you are Madge? You're a worrier.
Well, it's worth worrying about to be sure we're right.
Yeah.
I don't want to get off to California and then feel you only did it to please me.
Look... we're not just kids at our first picnic, we're old enough to know our own minds.
You just stick to that promise to marry me and I'll be happy to live anywhere.
Dad says I act more like a scared old maid than a widow with a growing son.
- Maybe he's right.
- Well?
All I know is that I want my boy Johnny to grow up in a peaceful, orderly country.
You've got that coming.
Only I'm afraid no country will stay peaceful long after Johnny gets there.
- Oh, Vance.
- Now, that's more like it.
I think you better go on back to town before your Dad gives his bank away.
- I'll meet you later when this is all over.
- All right.
Grey Eagle, round up Johnny and tell him his mother is ready to leave.
Yes.
What you going to do when
Mr. Cordell leaves Grey Eagle?
I don't know, maybe I come to California.
All right, 19 I've got. Who shall up?
Lady don't stand too close to that wheel, the team is liable to back up there on you.
- 19 I've got, who'll give me 20?
- I'll make it 20.
Oh, you better hurry Johnny or your mother will leave you.
No, she won't.
But I got to say this to you...
That while I've been standing here talking to you my friends...
Vance, if you're in town tonight drop in for supper.
Fine, I will if I can make it.
Ain't you going to kiss her like you do when I'm not around?
Johnny.
You know Johnny, that's a very good idea.
- Giddy up, boy.
- Goodbye.
But Madge, a bank is a place to put money in and take it out, ain't it?
- Well, I want to take some out.
- But Muley, you're not a depositor.
Fumbeydiddles, your Pa is
President of the bank, ain't he?
He runs it, don't he?
Well, that's got nothing to do it.
There are certain rules...
- The president makes the rules, don't he?
- Yes, but...
- Well, I want to see the president then.
- Very well.
You stay right there, I'll see if he's busy.
I can wait till he ain't.
Well, make it quick daughter,
I got to go meet the train.
Wait a minute Dad, Muley Wilson is outside, he wants to borrow money.
I told him he couldn't possibly make a loan without proper collateral but he won't listen.
No collateral, you done absolutely right, this here institution is a bank.
It's going to be run like one.
Bring him in here, I'll tell him.
Will you come in please?
What's the matter with you Muley? Run around trying to borrow money without collateral?
Well, Mr...
You better go back to your cashier's cage daughter.
Muley... don't you know that a bank is an institution that'll lend money to a man... only upon his furnishing absolute proof that he don't need to borrow it in the first place?
- How much you want?
- I kind of need about 300 John.
What do you want it for?
Well, I got to buy me a new wagon and some farming implements so I can make the run.
- How long have I known you Muley?
- About 3 years.
Well, here's 100 dollars for every year I've known you.
- You can have it on one condition.
- Anything you say Mr. President.
See to it that you settle in Guthrie.
If I catch you making eyes towards Oklahoma city...
I'll shoot you down like I would a local coyote.
Guthrie is my first love John, you're my second.
Your daughter kind of had me worried for a minute there.
Oh, Madge got a lot of newfangled notions about... bookkeeping, chattel mortgages and promissory notes, she'll get over it in time.
You know Muley... there ain't much point in writing things down in books... when most of the people you do business with can't write themselves.
All right, come on, get out of here now.
Hurry up, hurry up, get out, go on, go on.
The nerve of that Muley Wilson.
I guess I told him a thing or two.
Well, where's Johnny? If he's going to ride shotgun with me, he'd better hustle.
- He's waiting for you in the buckboard.
- Oh, yeah.
- Did you give him bills or coins?
- Bills.
- Sorry to keep you waiting Johnny.
- That's all right Grandpa.
- Is your gun loaded?
- Sure is.
- Yes sirree, you keep your eyes open now.
- You bet I will.
Giddy up boy.
Speaking of ice cream Johnny, did I ever tell you about the time that I...
We weren't speaking about ice cream Grandpa.
Well, you just said ice cream, didn't you?
- No, you did.
- All right, somebody did.
So speaking of ice cream, did I ever tell you about the time I drove 26 miles... to Lawrence, Kansas, in the blistering heat just to get a freezer full of ice cream... for your grandma when we was courting, eh?
The ice cream would've melted if it was blistering hot Grandpa.
Melted?
Why Johnny, the weather was so changeable in Kansas... before I got halfway back to the house... it blowed up a blizzard and
I darn near froze to death, yes sir.
I'd have froze stiffer than an injun's upper lip, except for one thing that saved my life.
Well...
Ain't you going to ask me what the one thing was that saved my life?
It was probably so much colder than ice cream Grandpa... you just snuggled up close to freezer, kept warm.
You don't lay out young feller, you're going to grow up to be just like your ma.
Giddy up, Mary.
Here she comes fellas, let's go down and watch her come in.
- Now you keep your eyes open Johnny.
- Sure will Grandpa.
Leslie, I have come for a certain express package, about so long, about so wide.
It's from a certain bank in Kansas to a certain bank right here in town.
I know just where it is.
Hey Joe, give me the package for the Bank of Braxton..
All ready for you.
- Sign here John.
- Yeah.
Much obliged boys.
- A lot of money in there Johnny.
- That's all right Grandpa.
- I'll protect it.
- Yeah, giddy up boy.
- What do you want?
- I'll take that first.
Now put your hands down and walk into that closet.
I'd like a ticket to St. Joe please.
St. Joe?
Got to work fast uncle Bill, they're on our trail..
- Posse?
- Army.
That'll be 12.60 dollars, please.
You know, you gents are in one of the most conservative banks in the territory.
Yes, sirree Bob.
And if you're going to settle near Guthrie... you won't make no mistake banking with John J. Pettit.
We take it in fast, pay it out just as fast when you want it.
Ask any of our depositors.
Why, we paid out 10,000 today.
We'll pay out twice that much tomorrow before we close up for good.
Yes, sirree Bob.
- 290, 295, $300, there you are Mrs. Moore.
- Thank you Madge.
Remember now, as soon as your father comes out of the... meeting with those cattlemen tell him I was here.
Be happy to.
And tell him I'll see him in Guthrie just as soon as he gets his bank started there.
I will Mrs. Moore.
Got a telegram here for the Bank of Braxton.
Oh, I'll take it.
You're new here, aren't you?
Well, this is my first job in the territory, if that's what you mean.
Oh, excuse me.
I'm sorry to interrupt Dad but I think you ought to see this.
What is it daughter?
Very interesting.
Listen to this gents.
Says we can expect a visit from some of the country's leading outlaws.
Billy the kid, the
Younger brothers, George Mason... and the Sundance kid.
Well, let them come, we're ready for them.
They won't get nothing around here but the worst of it.
That kind of talk sure impresses us Mr. Pettit.
- So you're ready for the outlaws?
- You're darn tooting.
See that rope?
Runs right on up through the ceiling to a bell, you can hear it all over town.
Means grab your guns and come a-running because a bank is being robbed.
Thanks Mr. Pettit, that's all we wanted to know.
You ain't the fellers
I was talking about, are you?
You catch on fast.
You two be quiet and nobody will get hurt.
Mason, keep your eye on them, let's go.
You're the most unethical, ornery bandits I ever done business with.
Everything is working out just like you said Bill.
Good, you all know what to do, get at it.
Get them up and be quiet.
- Hey, do we put our hands down?
- Sure, if you want to get shot.
Hey folks, that's the bell of the bank that's ringing.
Somebody is robbing the bank, come on.
- Here they come.
- Let's go.
Mason, come on.
- Come on Cheyenne.
- I'll be right with you.
- Where do you think you're going?
- To the...
Back to my office.
- Place looks pretty deserted, doesn't it?
- Yes, pretty lonesome.
Grey Eagle.
Take my horse, go into town and get
Doc green, we need him here quick.
All right, hold it cowboy.
- You'd better get back to bed.
- I mean what I said, stay where you are.
Now, take off your gun belt.
- Hurry up cowboy.
- Don't rush me.
Stop calling me cowboy,
I'm a retired rancher.
You'll be retired for keeps if you try anything funny.
Why should I?
You know, it's kind of unusual finding a girl riding around with a bullet hole in her arm.
Never mind about that, now kick the gun over here.
You'd better wait until the doctor gets here if you know what's good for you.
Turn around.
- You got a funny way of saying thanks.
- I said turn...
Come on Dad, you might as well lock up and go home.
Ain't nothing left to lock up.
Dad-blame bandits took everything but the cuckoo clock.
If that Vance Cordell would've been here they wouldn't have done it.
Vance said he might stop in for supper if nothing important detained him.
Supper? Well come on, let's go.
Doc, Doc...
- Yeah.
- How is she?
Oh, nothing dangerous, unless complications set in which isn't likely.
Grey eagle will give you some breakfast and take you into town.
- You need some sleep.
- All right, if you need me send for me.
Thanks for coming over Doc.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye Doc.
Good morning Cheyenne, how do you feel?
- You know my name?
- Doc green told me.
The whole territory is buzzing about that holdup.
So you're Bill Doolin's niece.
Did they, did they get uncle Bill?
Not that slippery old codger.
- Kind of fond of him, aren't you?
- Yes, and I'm proud of it.
Don't supposed you'd understand about things like that.
Why not? I know Bill.
- You do?
- Every peace officer in the Southwest does.
As a matter fact, I could've liked him if we hadn't been on opposite sides of the fence.
I can't say I like the way he brought up his relatives, though.
I do.
- How old are you?
- None of your business.
You know, I think the best medicine for you would be an old fashion spanking.
It might jar some of those crazy smart-aleck ideas out of your head.
You wouldn't dare.
Look kid, there's nothing smart about being outside the law. It just means you haven't... got the brains and the courage to keep in step with the rest of the people.
- Well, we did all right yesterday.
- Sure, you did great.
You got a little quick money and a bullet hole in your arm.
Next time, you'll pick up a little more gold and a little more lead.
And pretty soon, if you play your cards right... you can be one of the richest outlaws buried on boot hill.
- Well, that's a chance you take.
- That's right, maybe you won't get killed.
Maybe you'll live as long as your uncle and the way he does... half the time in jail and the other half in some dismal hideout.
That's a fine way for a young girl to spend her life.
- I suppose you know a better way.
- Women have been known to work.
I can just see myself waiting tables 6 days a week.
Some women even get married and raise families.
If they're not too busy robbing banks, of course.
Look mister, break up the prayer meeting.
It's already broken up. Here comes the posse.
What you going to do?
Go see them of course. You might as well relax, there are no more guns around.
- What's the trouble Ed?
- We're looking for a girl outlaw.
Part of a gang that robbed the Bank at Braxton.
She was headed this way but we lost her trail.
- She's carrying a lot of valuable bonds.
- I'll keep my eyes open.
If you see her don't take no chances just because she's a girl.
- She's tough as nails.
- I'll be careful.
Good.
- Boys let's water up before we move on.
- Help yourselves.
Thanks, Vance.
- Well, why didn't you turn me in?
- I got a better idea.
I'm going to let you turn yourself in.
You'll get off a lot easier.
Thanks.
- How is your arm?
- Oh, I wouldn't worry about it.
It'll have plenty of time to heal in jail.
Looks deserted all right, maybe she is hid out down there.
- Maybe it's a trap.
- You know, there's only one way to find out.
Hey Sundance, look who found outside, all saddled up and getting ready to leave.
- But he said Cheyenne hasn't been here.
- He's a liar, take a look at that.
Come on, let's hear about it.
You heard him, talk.
- Where is that girl?
- Take it easy Sundance.
- She has been here, hasn't she?
- Yes, but she go away.
She go away with Cordell?
They must've gone back to Braxton.
We got to catch him before he turns those bonds in.
- And Cheyenne along with them.
- Where is she?
Let's get out of here.
We're going to get nothing out of him.
I'll get something out of him.
- You go along, I'll catch up with you.
- Come on Billy.
No, no.
I'm leaving at the top of the next hill.
Braxton is just on the other side.
You mean you trust me to go up the rest of the way alone and with these?
I've got your word, haven't I?
Suppose after you leave me
I decide to make a break for it?
- I don't think you will.
- But suppose I do.
- I'll go after you and bring you back.
- That's what I thought.
Used to be a pretty good cowhand.
Take it easy fella and you won't get hurt.
- Hello Vance.
- Hello Cole.
Like old home week, isn't it?
Sort of so... except that things have changed a little this time, take his gun kid.
- Cheyenne, you got the bonds?
- Right here.
Too bad mister, all that good preaching gone to waste.
Still makes sense.
Better think it over before you make another mistake.
You almost convinced me a couple of times.
- But I guess I'll never know how...
- What is all this?
Just a little discussion we were having.
Any more gab out of you and you'll be deader than that Indian of yours.
- Why, you...
- Easy Cordell.
Sundance, your mouth is too big.
What's he going to do about it?
Get rid of your gun or give me one and I'll show you.
Sure, I'll give you a gun.
Let's get out of here.
- Hurry up Billy, let's go.
- No, I think I'll check out about here.
What's eating you?
You, I don't like the way you operate.
You're getting kind of particular, ain't you?
I always was, that's why I'm pulling out now.
Well, if you want to be a lone wolf nobody is going to stop you.
That's right, nobody is going to stop me.
- Like to come along Cheyenne?
- Thanks Kid, I'll stick with uncle Bill.
I wouldn't try that if I were you.
He got eyes in the back of his head.
You know, with Mason getting killed in the Braxton holdup... and Billy the kid running out on us our cut's getting bigger and bigger.
Yeah, well don't worry about it.
Billy is still going to get his share.
- Mason won't.
- Wonder if Mason had a wife.
It ain't likely.
Some women even get married and raise families.
If they're not too busy robbing banks, of course.
You know, Doolin sure picked himself a hideout.
You can spend the rest of your life here and nobody would find you.
I wouldn't mind that.
Plenty of liquor and...
The right kind of entertainment.
I hope we get there before dark.
Half the time in jail and the other half in some dismal hideout.
That's a fine way for a young girl to spend her life.
Hold it boys, get down off those horses..
What's the matter with you? You gone loco?
- I've just come to my senses, that's all.
- Take it easy.
Try that again, I'll put one right between your eyes.
Now turn around and give me your guns.
- I don't get it Cheyenne.
- I do, she's double-crossing us.
That money won't do you any good.
We'll find you wherever you go.
That will be easy, just look in the nearest jail.
- You're going to give yourself up?
- That's right.
Tell uncle Bill I'm sorry, but, well, maybe he'll understand.
- I'll remember this too.
- All right, you remember and I'll forget.
That's a great bunch those friends of yours.
Grey eagle wasn't even carrying a gun.
I'm awfully sorry... but they're not my friends anymore.
- What made you change your mind?
- That's a woman's privilege, isn't it?
Maybe I got to thinking about what you said, you know... getting a job and... maybe someday getting married and...
Well, it's all right here and... there's a souvenir for you too.
- Where you leave them?
- That's not part of the deal.
Someday I'll be giving this back to the Sundance kid.
- Nervous?
- I'm scared to death.
Easy does it.
If anything happens to iron Betsy there there won't be no bank in Guthrie.
Oh Dave, do me a favor.
Take Grey Eagle up to the burial ground, I'll meet you there later.
All right Vance, I'll take care of him.
- Oh, judge.
- Yes, Vance?
Here's a young lady that has something to say to you.
- Yeah? What is it?
- I guess you're looking for me.
- The name is Cheyenne.
- The girl outlaw, eh?
Oh, where did you catch her?
I didn't. She came in voluntarily.
- You mean, she's giving herself up?
- Of her own free will, remember that judge.
Oh, I see.
Let me through here.
What's the matter? Need any help?
Oh, there's nothing the matter... but I got a big surprise for you John, eh?
Here all your bonds, safe and sound.
Well, where you get them?
- This young lady brought them back.
- Well, I'm sure obliged to her.
- Why, why, she's one of the...
- Yeah, yeah, they know all about it.
Oh, oh, they do, eh?
Well, we're sure back in business Vance.
Come on Cheyenne, I'll have to take her back to Fort Smith for trial Vance but...,
I'll remember what you've said.
Well, I guess this is goodbye, thanks for everything.
Good luck Cheyenne.
Vance, what happened?
Well, the outlaws came to my ranch while I was away.
The Sundance Kid got gun crazy and killed Grey Eagle.
What did she mean, thanks for everything?
- Oh, I got Doc Green to patch up her arm.
- What made her give herself up?
I suppose she decided was the best thing to do.
You mean you decided.
Well, call it half and half.
Vance, what you going to do about Grey Eagle?
- Let the law handle it.
- You sure?
Now, don't you worry Madge.
We've still got that date for California.
I'll see you at the train.
All right. Step up, folks.
Step back in the car folks.
- Goodbye Mary.
- Goodbye Henry, I'm sure going to miss you.
Now, don't worry I'll send for you as soon as I get us a good place staked out.
I'll be waiting.
- Hey Frank?
- Yeah?
I'll hold all the supplies in
Kansas City till I hear from you.
You'll be hearing from me as soon as I can get our store up.
- Good luck Frank.
- Same to you.
Goodbye.
This is the last train out of Braxton folks.
All aboard.
- Well, looks like you're on your way.
- Dad, have you seen Vance?
Now, maybe he got delayed, you and Johnny just take it easy in Kansas City.
We'll let you know when everything's in shape.
I don't want to take it easy.
I want to go in the run with you Grandpa.
Somebody is got to guard that safe.
Say, that reminds me. All of our assets are in that safe and it's all on the wagon.
Take good care of your Ma now Johnny.
All aboard.
Ma, look Ma, there he is.
Vance, Vance, here we are.
Oh, I'm sorry I'm late but I'll be seeing you soon, get yourself a nice wedding dress.
- What color?
- Blue like your eyes.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- Johnny take care of your mother.
- Sure will.
- And look out Madge, take care of yourself.
- I will, write to me Vance.
Don't worry I will, now get inside.
- John, this is the end of Braxton.
- Yeap, and the beginning of Guthrie.
- Let's go.
- All right.
- All set John?
- Yeap.
Don't forget now Vance, get me something right smack-dab in the center of the town..
You know, a bank's got be where folks can see it.
I'll do the best I can.
- One minute, pass the word. Get ready to go.
- Yes sir.
- See you there.
- Good luck.
- Vance, how long take you to shave?
- Oh, about 15-20 minutes, why?
Let me see now, 7 times 20,
Why, is over 2 hours a week.
Times 52...
You realize you lose 4 full days out of your life every year just hacking your whiskers off?
- Is that why you got a beard?
- Sure.
Why, in 10 years you've wasted over a month.
Think of it, a whole month wasted just shaving.
Why, if nobody ever shaved then everybody would look like you.
- Well, what's wrong with that?
- What's wrong with that? Here.
- Tack that up for me, will you?
- Sure.
- Hello Vance.
- Hiya Muley.
Let's have a little service around here, what kind of a bank is this anyhow?
There's where we do business, right over at the window.
Well Muley, you're my first customer, you come in to pay me back that 300 you owe me?
Well, not exactly John.
You kind of got the pig by the tail instead of the snout.
Fact is I had in mind to borrow $200.
Sorry, Lending department ain't open yet, just the receiving.
Now, wait a minute John.
I spent that money you gave me before for a wagon and tools.
Now I got to build me a barn to keep the wagon and tools in.
Seems to me I've done everything but plow your ground for you.
- You could help Sundays.
- Yeah...
Sign there.
- Hello Vance.
- Oh, hello colonel.
Well, from the looks of that
I guess civilization is really here now.
It's a beginning anyway.
It makes you wonder though.
Where do they all come from?
Sometimes that's an unhealthy question to ask.
Well, I don't know, it's been a lot quieter so far than we'd expected.
Well, with a mob like this there'll be a lot of weeding out to do... before Guthrie settles down to being a real town.
- Maybe, but we won't be around for that.
- No?
No, my orders are to clear out as soon as the main rush is over.
Is that so?
- See you later Vance.
- So long colonel.
Put your hands up.
All right, get out and keep your hands up.
Hurry up.
Stick them up.
Doggone it Johnny, you might've got yourself shot.
Madge, what you doing here? We didn't send for you yet.
I didn't wait to be sent for.
Absence may make the heart grow fonder but there's no sense in overdoing it.
Where is he?
- Who? Vance?
- How you guess?
He's over at the army headquarters, they're pulling out today.
- Where is it?
- Across the street.
Well, what do you think of the new bank?
I didn't come all these miles to see a bank, come on.
Excuse, please.
Well, there he is. Ain't you going to let him know you're here?
Dad.
Well Vance, I guess that just about lines us up here.
Well, we hate to see you go colonel, you've done a very fine job.
Thanks.
Jim, take care of yourself.
Who takes over? Have you decided yet?
Well, that's why I asked you all to come here.
Folks, you're the ones who will be living in the territory... so I wanted to be sure the man I appointed marshal met with your approval.
By virtue of his experience as a Texas ranger and a peace officer... the man best qualified for the job is Mr. Cordell here.
Well I... appreciate the confidence, ladies and gentlemen... however, I'm afraid however,
I'm afraid I can't accept.
I'm not going to be staying here, in fact
I'm pulling out myself in a few days.
Why, it isn't a permanent job Vance, it's just a temporary appointment... until such time as regular peace officers can be trained and made available.
I understand sir but, you see...
Perhaps I haven't made myself entirely clear.
I'm operating under direct authority from the President of the United States.
My orders are to select the best...
You'd better hurry if you're going to stop this.
- Wait a minute.
- You heard what that feller said.
They're going to make him marshal.
It isn't just a question of personal convenience colonel.
It's, well it, it involves more than my own plans.
So do we, there's 30,000 of us in this territory and we want protection.
I realize that, it's just that I...
Get him to doc.
Look out, let me through here.
- What's wrong, Steve?
- A holdup right this side of three forks.
They shot Tom Allen before he get his hands up.
- How many were there?
- Three of them.
But only got a good look at the one that shot Tom.
- Recognize him?
- He looked like the Sundance kid to me.
- Sundance kid, eh?
- Yeah.
- All right Steve, I'll take care of it.
- Thank you colonel.
Colonel, I've changed my mind, I'll take the job.
Good Vance, good.
See, I'm going to swear you in right now.
As a former Texas ranger you're probably... familiar with the oath of office of the United States marshal.
Yes, sir.
Ma, did you hear that?
Uncle Vance is going to be the marshal.
By virtue of the authority vested in me
I appoint you United States Marshal.
Congratulations.
Vance, look who's here.
Well, hello Johnny, where in the world did you come from? Is your mother here?
- She heard everything.
- Excuse me.
Madge, Madge.
- Hello Vance.
- What a happy surprise.
I guess we both got one.
It won't be for long. I'll train some new men to take over, men who are staying here.
And we'll be on our way in no time..
- Just as soon as...
- Just as soon as you get Sundance.
- That's what you really want, isn't it?
- Well, it's part of the job.
I understand, Vance.
Twos right, twos right.
I swear daughter, if you was a little mite younger I'd take you across my knee and...
- What's the matter?
- Matter?
What you think is the matter? Vance tells me you're postponing the wedding.
That's right.
Fine time to walk out on him, just when he's taking on a big job.
Oh, I'm not walking out on him.
- Vance understands.
- Well, I don't.
You ought to marry him right here and now.
Just because your first husband was a peace officer, don't mean...
We both agree it's best to wait.
Dad, every night if Vance were late
I'd think of the last time I waited... and how they brought Johnny's father home.
Maybe men can get over things like that but I could never go through it again.
I wouldn't be any good for him.
Oh, leave me alone, can't you?
You think I don't want to marry him?
Sure, sure, I understand honey.
I guess I'd better stick to that dad-blame banking business.
Sometimes I don't think you're very smart
Sundance and this is one of the times.
This stuff ain't going to walk in by itself.
Somebody has to go out and get it.
We didn't have to come to this territory for chicken feed like that.
- Can't you get that through your head?
- I don't notice you're doing any better.
We will when I give the word and not before.
You start fooling around with penny ante stuff like that... first thing you know, you got a country full of posses before the big pickings are ripe.
- All right Bill, but Sundance thought...
- Never mind what Sundance thought.
Let me do the thinking.
I planned this and I'll run it.
Anybody wants to operate different he checks out right now.
You've been riding me ever since we started.
You heard the deal, make up your mind.
Hey Doolin, here comes the Dalton boys.
- All right Danny?
- Hi Bob. Hi Emmett. Hi Grat.
- Hiya Bob.
- What you say?
- Hello Bob.
- Hi Emmett, glad to see you again.
- Hiya Doolin.
- Hello Bob.
Well, how's that chunk of sheriff's lead in your leg?
Reliable as ever Bob, gives off sparks like a flint when things ain't right..
Sure is a miserable country you picked out.
Where's all them big, fat banks you wrote us about?
He's saving it up for our old age.
Me and Sundance were just about to settle something.
- You might as well get in on it too.
- Shoot.
This a new country, the army is been running it up to now but they're leaving.
I don't want to start anything till... they're back where they belong and these new towns got enough in them to go after.
Then we'll split up and go so fast their new deputies won't know what hit them or when.
- Sounds Ok to me.
- Another thing.
We're going to keep the homesteaders neutral.
If we need beef or a new horse, we pay for it.
Let them know they won't get hurt as long as they play square with us.
Well, that's just common sense.
What is to settle about that?
- Somebody has to be boss.
- We've ridden with you before.
- We'll string along.
- It's your party, you call it.
Well, we going to stand here gabbing all day?
- Why don't you get rid of him?
- He's a good man.
So long as you keep him in front of you.
Arkansas, take care of the horses.
Judge Harper, glad to see you.
When did you get in?
- Just now.
- What brings you here, business or pleasure?
Well, a little of both.
How's the new job coming?
- Oh, all right I guess, sit down.
- Any news of the Doolin gang?
Not since that holdup.
- Maybe he pulled out.
- You know Doolin.
In an un-organized territory like this he'd never pull out after one job.
No, no, it doesn't sound like him.
What do you make of it?
I don't know.
All I'm sure of is... he's got something up his sleeve and the longer he waits the bigger it's going to be.
- Now, who's in there?
- Why don't you go see?
Cheyenne, what you doing here?
Oh, just practicing and I'm not Cheyenne anymore, I'm back to Jeanie McBride again.
Say, let me look at you.
Oh, you've changed more than just your name. I'd hardly know you.
Well, I can't tell whether that's a compliment or not.
Oh, stop fishing and tell him why you're here.
Well, the judge thought...
That is, if it's all right with you.
Well, he's willing to parole me if we can...
I've always figured that the function of the law was to rehabilitate as well as punish.
She'll be a lot better off working in an honest job than... sitting out her term in a woman's reformatory.
That's swell judge, but...
You see, I've got to be paroled to someone and I've got to have a job and... well, we thought maybe if you were looking for a good telegrapher...
Well, I didn't know you could handle one of those.
Uncle Bill taught me it... it sometimes came in handy for his business.
How about it, Vance?
You're hired.
I promise you won't be sorry and you too judge.
- Well, that's that.
- Thanks.
I got the papers right here.
I also brought along the marriage license.
Thought you might as well sign them both at once.
- Sign the parole right there.
- All right.
I've got to go back in a couple of days.
Are you and Madge all set for the wedding?
I'm afraid we'll have to catch you next time, judge.
You see, we decided to put it off until after the marshal job is over.
You better not wait too long or I'll marry her myself.
- Oh Cheyenne, have you got a place to stay?
- Oh not yet, I wasn't sure I was staying.
Well, Madge is at the hotel. I'll take... you over and she'll look after you until you can find a place.
That'll be nice.
Coming.
- Vance.
- Hello Madge.
- You remember Che, I mean Jeanie McBride.
- Yes, I remember her.
Our last meeting wasn't too fortunate, I hope I can live it down.
Well, won't you come in?
Thanks.
Jeanie is just been paroled to me by judge Harper.
She's going to work in the office.
I just got her a room here so you could sort of look after her if she needed a hand.
Why yes, of course.
I told Vance, oh I mean, Mr. Cordell...
You were right the first time, nobody calls me mister around here.
Well, I said it wasn't fair for him to ask you to do this for me.
Oh, I'm glad to do it.
Good, good. Then you two can keep each other company.
Well, thanks you both, I got to go and unpack, I'll see you later Mrs. Allen.
Madge, that's mighty fine of you, she's really going to need a friend around here.
Seemed to me that day at the bank she could take care of herself quite well.
Well...
- Come on honey, give her a chance.
- All right, on one condition.
Name it.
That you never again sweep in here like that when I'm doing laundry.
Why, you look beautiful.
Go on downstairs now and wait for me while I get dressed.
- See you later.
- Yes.
- How it go?
- Fine judge.
- They'll get along like a couple of sisters.
- Good, I knew we could depend on Madge.
That's quite a fire.
- Looks like everybody in town is down there.
- Yeap, everybody but us.
That was the idea.
All right boys.
You see that nut hole on the hitching post across the street there?
- Yes sir.
- Well, you line up on that.
Now, you don't jerk the trigger, you know.
You just squeeze it a little mite.
- Understand?
- You bet Mr. Pettit.
Just squeeze it a little mite.
- Yeah, you're going to be all right son.
- Thank you sir.
You know, I'm going to make a good shot out of that young feller.
- That's what we need.
- Well, what's your next move?
I've blocked out the whole territory in the district.
Say, that's a lot of ground to cover, ain't it?
Yes, but...
Here's a message that just came from Ardmore.
Round up the boys Dave.
- Looks like they've started.
- Yes sir.
Looks like we better get started too.
- Howdy mister.
- Howdy.
We've lost the trail of some outlaws up by Shawnee.
I wondered if you'd seen any signs of them out this way.
I wouldn't know who was outlaws and who wasn't.
Well, have you seen any strangers around here?
I never notice strangers mister.
Lately, it seems all you farmers find it convenient to keep your eyes and ears shut.
Well, I always try to mind my own business and keep out of other people's.
Outlaws are your business too.
This is your country, we can't fight robbery and murder if the people in it don't help us.
Well, I'm getting all the fighting I want with the soil and the weather.
- It's all I can handle.
- We're not asking you to fight.
All we want is information.
Look, Mr. Marshal, I got a wife and 2 kids.
Them bandits ain't bothering me and I don't aim to give them no reason to.
Understand your feelings friend... but withholding information from the law isn't going to make this territory... safe for your wife and family.
As soon as you realize that get in touch with my office in Guthrie.
- So long friend.
- So long.
Hello.
- Oh, I saw the light on, and I thought...
- No, he isn't back yet.
- You must be expecting him tonight.
- I never expect him until I see him.
- I just work here, you know.
- All night?
- I like my job.
- Yes, I know.
- You haven't said yet when he'll be back.
- Well, I really couldn't tell you.
- If you care to leave the tray...
- Oh, I'll wait.
Suit yourself.
- Would you like some coffee?
- No, thanks.
I'm sorry you resent my coming down here.
After all you know, I'm engaged to him.
Yes, I know.
You're engaged but you don't want to get married until you can have things your way.
You don't care anything about his work.
You never try to do anything to help him that'll make things easier for him.
- You're in love with him too, aren't you?
- Suppose I am.
What you going to do about it?
What would you do if you were in my place?
If I were in your place,
I'd marry him right away.
Fortunately however, you're not in my place.
It would be better for him if I were.
- I really don't care to discuss it.
- Well, I do.
It may not ladylike to talk like this but, well, thank goodness I'm not a lady.
If I loved a man and he wanted me
I wouldn't wait for orange blossoms... and a honeymoon in California.
Why, I'd marry him in a blizzard in the middle of a desert.
- Are you all through?
- Why?
- Did I shock you?
- No.
Before you try any harder to let me tell you something.
I was raised in a frontier country.
When I was a girl
I used to load the guns for my... father and mother when the Indians raided our farm.
I was alone in the house for 12 hours when my child was born.
So don't confuse good manners with softness.
Well, doesn't anyone ever go to sleep around here?
- We were just waiting for you.
- Any luck?
No, same old story, hit and run.
It's just like trying to catch ghosts.
- Where the coffee come from?
- Oh, I thought you'd be needing it.
You bet, Jeanie must've told you I'd be late.
- Oh, some messages came while you were gone.
- Anything important?
- No.
- Well, I'll look at them in the morning.
You look a little tired Jeanie.
Why don't you go home and get some sleep?
That's a good idea.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Good night Vance,
I'll see you in the morning.
Good night Jeanie.
Oh, that's fine.
That sure hits the spot.
- Tired?
- A little.
You know Madge, they really ran us ragged.
First, they were here, then
2 days later they were over here.
Then back this way, then up to Osage.
Not even the Doolin gang can move that fast.
They must be operating in teams on a regular schedule.
What can you do about it?
I want to see if there's some sort of pattern to it.
If I can figure out how they're operating... maybe next time I can be there first, waiting for them.
- Let me see now.
- Vance...
No, trouble is there's still too many places for them to hit.
Would you like to get married right away?
I just proposed to you.
You're a little late.
I beat you to that 3 months ago.
- Oh, I mean right away, tomorrow.
- Now what brought this on?
Oh?
That's not a very romantic answer.
No, but you're not looking at a very romantic guy right now.
Well, it was just an idea.
Look Madge...
You know better than that.
We decided it would be best to wait until after this was over and we were right.
We wouldn't be having much home life these days.
I think I'd better finish up my work tonight and...
Oh, then I'll go Vance,
I don't want to disturb you.
Thanks for the coffee.
And the proposal.
Vance...
I hope you catch them very soon.
- Don't work too late.
- I won't.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Excuse me.
Scared you, didn't it?
Kind of fooled you for a minute.
Why, it's nothing but the wind.
Go boy, get along now.
Giddy up now, giddy up now.
700, 800, this rate Emily, you'll soon be owning the bank.
- What would I do with a bank?
- I swear I don't know.
I sometimes wonder what I'm doing with it.
- That was 800, wasn't it?
- You counted it.
Yeah, yeah, 800 dollars.
There you are Emily, just for that, you can dance with me tonight.
There won't be no dancing in Guthrie tonight.
John, John...
- Here's that $500 I owe you John.
- What you doing in here Muley?
Go on around to the window there where I do business.
- Now then, what can I do for you?
- Here John, take it quick.
Oh, what's the rush?
Say, you look like you've seen a ghost.
I did John, weirdest ghost you ever seen.
Oh?
I've seen it, I tell you. Seen it with my own eyes sweeping out the saloon at Braxton.
A ghost sweeping out a saloon?
You got to quit drinking Muley.
I did, when I seen that ghost.
I guess I better put that ghost on my payroll. That's 10, 20, 30...
Howdy John.
- Hi, I'll walk home with you.
- All right.
Closing up a little early today, aren't you?
It's all right, best part of being president.
Open up when you want, close up when you get tired.
Besides, I've done enough business this morning to last me all week.
- Yeah?
- Yes sir, I got them coming and going.
Emily dropped in on her way out of town to deposit $800.
Yeah?
Yes, just as she was leaving Muley
Wilson comes busting in all heated up.
- He paid back 500.
- Good, good.
Said he'd seen a ghost weeping out the saloon at Braxton.
- A ghost?
- That's what he said.
Anything that makes
Muley pay up I ain't arguing with.
I reckon he figured maybe the spirits was getting ready to give him a private party.
Now, if some of my other customers just get the same id...
- Say John, did Emily say where she's going?
- No, but she sure was all dressed up.
- She was?
- Fit to kill.
Say John, you don't know it but you closed too early, you're going to open up again..
Hey, wait a minute here, I don't...
Here they are Vance.
- You sure these are the bills she gave you?
- I put them right on top, all together.
Brand new, right out of a bank vault.
I may be crazy, but tell Jeanie to get in touch with Ardmore in Tulsa.
Have him send all their deputies to meet me right out of Braxton...
- as fast as they can get there.
- You think the bandits are there?
- You're too nosy, I'll get my men together.
- You got one together right now.
- How's it going Jeanie?
- Well, I've sent all the messages.
Good.
Take care of things while I'm gone.
You're in full charge, remember that.
- You remember and take care of yourself.
- I will.
Gangway, let me through there boys.
Vance, Vance. Well, come on.
What are we waiting for?
I know how you feel, John, but you're not a deputy.
The heck I ain't.
I found out where you keep your badges.
Deputy John Pettit, let's go.
- So long Jeanie, keep your fingers crossed.
- Good luck.
Vance...
Oh, I thought I'd miss you.
- Hurry back, I'll have the coffee waiting.
- Good and keep it hot.
All right boys.

Why don't you wipe that sour look off your face Doolin, you're spoiling the party.
We're supposed to be enjoying ourselves.
You'll enjoy yourself a lot more by staying away from me.
Easy Sundance, let's go.
- Bill, just like old times, ain't it?
- Yeah,
- You don't seem to be having no fun.
- No, I ain't.
Looks like the rest of our boys not going to show up.
What you going to do now Vance?
Can't afford to wait any longer.
Kind of scary, ain't it? Being the only people in the whole town.
Be a whole lot more scary if we wasn't the only people in the whole town.
People in Guthrie sure be surprised to see me now.
Who would ever think this old saloon would ever see a party again?
Why, it's like something coming back from the dead.
- Hey, what's the matter?
- I don't know.
I just got a feeling something is wrong, come on inside.
- Come along, come along.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Hold that music, turn off the lights.
- What's the matter Doolin?
- I don't know, yet.
- Oh, what you stopping the music for?
- Hold on Doolin.
I suppose that leg of yours is acting up again.
- What if it is? Let's look around Cole.
- Wait a minute Doolin.
I ain't letting you bust up this party on account of your rheumatism.
I thought we settled this once, I'm giving the orders.
Not tonight you're not.
Somebody is got to cut you down to size
Sundance, I guess now is the time..
Turn off those lights.
We've got you surrounded Doolin, you and your men come out with your hands up.
Emily get your girls out of the way.
Cole, Jim, Bob, Emmett, Grat, follow me.
Haul it out.
Emmett, get ready to open those doors as soon as I light this.
The rest of you push it out into the street as soon as it hits make a break for it.
What about you Bill?
You'll make it all right?
Never mind about me, I'll take care of myself.
All right, hurry it up.
We want to be out of this county by sundown.
Why don't you boys stick around, this is a big territory.
- Not big enough.
- Bill had the right idea, shoot and run.
- Only he didn't run fast enough.
- I'll get the horse.
- Right with you.
- So long.
- Where you heading for Bob?
- Back to Kansas I guess, see you.
- So long.
- So long.
Anybody got any extra shells?
What's the matter with you guys, you deaf?
We heard you.
- You got plenty of them.
- I need them myself.
I suppose you think it's all my fault, don't you?
What do you think?
If you'd listen to Bill when you should've we wouldn't be packing now.
All right, so I talked out of turn.
But if you're such pals of Doolin's why don't you stay here and help me... bust him loose instead of running out.
You talk big Sundance, they got every deputy in town guarding him.
They got to get him out of town for the trial, don't they?
Sure, they're going to put up a great big sign... says, Bill Doolin leaving on train number 9.
- Suppose I can get that information for you.
- How?
Ride into town with me and find out.
When you get the information we'll ride with you.
I'll get it.
- Anybody with me?
- Arkansas and me are with you.
Hello Cheyenne,
I didn't know you all dressed up.
- What do you want?
- We've come to help you.
- I don't need your help.
- Your uncle Bill does.
You wouldn't want to see him go to prison for life, would you?
All you got to do is tell us what day they're taking him away, we'll do the rest.
Nobody would know you had anything to do with it.
You want me to double cross the people that trust me, is that it?
Now listen kid...
I'm going to get what I came after one way or the other is up to you how easy it goes.
- I'm not going to tell you a thing.
- I'm asking you for the last time nice.
- When are they taking him away?
- I won't tell you.
- Help.
- Come here.
Shut off them lights.
Now we'll have the whole territory on our trail.
Let's get out of here.
Let's go.
Hey Sundance.
- What's the matter?
- My horse has gone lame.
What do you expect me to do about it?
Looks like you'll have to let me ride double till I get another horse.
I guess you're right, this ain't no country for a man to be on foot.
Take off your saddle and give it to Bill.
Hey Sundance.
- What's the matter?
- I'm tired of running.
Let's wait for him and finish it right here.
Not me.
If you're going to stay here, you stay alone.
All right, I'll wait alone.
At least I won't finish like Arkansas.
Give me a chance Cordell.
Give you a chance like you gave Grey Eagle and Cheyenne?
- That was an accident, I didn't mean...
- I said someday I'd give you your gun back.
And this is it.
But first, you and
I've got a lot of things to settle.
Hey Muley, we got to answer this letter.
It's been laying around here for a long time.
Now you put down what I tell you.
Dear Jim, enclosed find $1,000 you asked for in your last letter.
That's the way I'd like to start this letter only your security ain't no good... and you don't get the money.
Sign it John J. Pettit.
I wish I'd never seen this dad-blasted banking business.
- What about some service over here?
- Well, what can I do for you?
We want to borrow $5,000 in a hurry.
Well, if your collateral's all right
I guess we can make you a deal.
Will this due?
You ain't aiming to borrow 5,000 dollars on your wedding ring?
Well, it's worth lots more than that to me.
A lot of money you're asking for and it's a long ways to California for me to collect.
- You might as well tell him Madge.
- We're staying right here dad.
I've decided Oklahoma needs
Vance more than California does.
You mean you're going to settle right here in Guthrie permanent?
That's right.
Well, you kids have got yourself a bank, is yours lock, stock and barrel.
- Hey, wait a minute.
- Come on back here Vance and go to work.
Madge will show you how it's done.
Come on Muley, change your coat, hook up a team, we're going to California.
- I'm with you John.
- Come on man, don't fool around here.
- Yeah.
- No time to waist.
